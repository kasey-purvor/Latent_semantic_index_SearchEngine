Political science none the \nless necessarily depends upon and is epistemologically comparable with political \nscholarship. I deploy Boyer\u2019s distinctions between discovery, integration, application \nand renewing the profession to show that these connections are close woven. Two sets \nof key challenges need to be tackled if contemporary political science is to develop \npositively. The first is to ditch the current unworkable and restrictive comparative \npolitics approach, in favour of a genuinely global analysis framework. Instead of \nobsessively looking at data on nation states, we need to seek data completeness on the \nwhole (multi-level) world we have. A second cluster of challenges involves looking \nfar more deeply into political phenomena; reaping the benefits of \u2018digital era\u2019 \ndevelopments; moving from sample methods to online census methods in \norganizational analysis; analysing massive transactional databases and real-time \npolitical processes (again, instead of depending on surveys); and devising new forms \nof \u2018instrumentation\u2019, informed by post-rational choice theoretical perspectives. \n 2 \n \nNEW WORLDS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE \n \n \nPatrick Dunleavy \n \n \nLondon School of Economics and Political Science \n \n \n \n \nOne does not set out in search of new lands without being \nwilling to be alone on an empty sea. \n        Andre Gide  1 \n \n \n \nThe undeveloped state of political science has been a theme for depressed navel-\ngazing in the profession over the last two decades. Our collective mood nowadays \nseems far removed from the confidence that attended the first lectures in Cambridge \nby Sir John Seeley (1896), the assertive pro-state position of early American political \nscience in the hands of the younger Woodrow Wilson (see Dryzek et al, 1995), the \nenthusiasm of the post-war \u2018behavioural revolution\u2019 or the early hopes of the rational \nchoice pioneers. In the UK\u2019s \u2018Political Studies\u2019 or \u2018Government\u2019 departments (the \ncontinued British naming equivocation says it all) it is not hard to find people who \nagree heartily with Hal Abelson\u2019s populist judgement: \u2018Anything which uses science \nas part of its name isn't: political science, creation science, computer science\u2019.2 \n Yet the mainspring of current pessimism is actually localized chiefly in three \nareas that should be manageable - the inescapable eclecticism of over-inclusive \ndefinitions of \u2018political science\u2019; the apparent \u2018reset to zero\u2019 character of theory \ndisputes; and the problems of doing cumulative research in a fast-changing area of \nhuman behaviour. In Part 1 of the paper I seek to insulate forward thinking against \nthese difficulties by defining an explicitly \u2018vanguardist\u2019 (that is, non-inclusive) idea of \n\u2018political science\u2019, but one which none the less rests on a wider sub-structure of \n\u2018political scholarship\u2019 Political scholarship still predominates in our discipline and its \nrole is both essential and fully legitimate. But political science means something \nmore.  \n 3 \nIn Parts 2 and 3 I briefly explore two \u2018new worlds\u2019 for a re-focused political \nscience, whose tackling or neglect will define our discipline for the next half century. \nOne is to begin to build a genuinely global political analysis that can for the first time \ncapture political experiences across the whole world we have and treat them \nintelligently and equitably. To do so will require that we \u2018break the mould\u2019 of \ncomparative politics, whose existing practice fetishizes the nation state as a unit of \nanalysis and focuses single-mindedly on the same stale set of macro-institutional \nfeatures, when we know that many different micro-institutions matter.  \nThe second set of challenges is to look more deeply and precisely at political \nbehaviours than we have so far attempted. We need to radically modernise and \nupgrade our ambitions to collect evidence, our analysis of \u2018fields\u2019 of possibilities and \nour standards of proof and analysis. Key pointers to a better future include using non-\nreactive web census methods, analysing transactional and events data, and embracing \n\u2018post rational choice\u2019 theories and new methods. \n \n \n1. Political Science and Political Scholarship \n \n \nScience is built up with facts, as a house is with \nstones. But a collection of facts is no more a science \nthan a heap of stones is a house.  \n      Henri Poincar\u00e9 3 \n \nA lot of learning can be a little thing. \n Spike Milligan 4 \n \n \nIf our discipline means everything that gets done within departments labelled \n\u2018political science\u2019 or \u2018political studies\u2019, its common purposes will seem elusive and its \ncontent eclectic. An APSR editorial pessimistically observed: \n\u2018Political science is a strange discipline. Indeed, it is hardly a discipline at \nall\u2026 [R]ather than being a distinct branch of learning, political science is a \ncrazy quilt of borrowings from history, philosophy, law, sociology, \npsychology, economics, public administration, policy studies, area studies, \ninternational studies, civics, and a variety of other sources. Any real coherence \nin political science exists only at the broadest conceptual level\u2026\u2019. (Siegelman, \n2002, p. viii). \n 4 \n \nA second area of concern for pessimists is that political science (like the rest \nof the social sciences and humanities) will remain a \u2018non-paradigm\u2019 field in Kuhn\u2019s \nterms, where intellectual disputes constantly threaten to \u2018reset to zero\u2019 established \nresults by challenging their provenance, methods, empirical validity or theoretical \npremisses. Because of this \u2018pull it up to examine the roots\u2019 approach, political science \nwill not become what Randall Collins (1994) famously called \u2018High-Consensus, \nRapid-Discovery Science\u2019 as found in the physical sciences. Beginning around 1600 \nonwards and moving at an accelerating pace over time all the STEM disciplines5 were \ndistinguished by \u2018high consensus on what counts as secure knowledge and rapid-\ndiscovery of a train of new results\u2019. A \u2018law of small numbers\u2019 in intellectual disputes \nstill operates in these disciplines (see Collins, 1998), but only at the research frontier \nitself: \n\u2018It is the existence of the rapid discovery research front that makes consensus \npossible on old results. When scientists have confidence they have a reliable \nmethod of discovery, they are attracted by the greater payoff in moving to a \nnew problem than in continuing to expound old positions. The research \nforefront upstages all older controversies in the struggle for attention. Because \nthe field is moving rapidly, prestige goes to the group associated with a \nlineage of innovations, which carries the implicit promise of being able to \nproduce still further discoveries in the future. Rapid discovery and consensus \nare part of the same complex; what makes something regarded as a discovery \nrather than as a phenomenon subject to multiple interpretations is that it soon \npasses into the realm of consensus, and that depends upon the social \nmotivation to move onward to fresh phenomena\u2019 (Collins, 1994, pp.160-1). \n \nBy contrast, in fields without assured rapid discovery methods, not only is debate \nbetween alternative positions pervasive, but academic prestige can often best be built \nby debating or reinterpreting \u2018fundamentals\u2019, \u2018the cannon\u2019 or classic texts over (and \nover) again. In this light, political science certainly has recurring-but-moving-on \ndebates \u2013 for instance, modern theories of the state have remained recognizably \nconnected across two decades of modern debates (compare Dryzek and Dunleavy, \n2009 with Dunleavy and O\u2019Leary, 1987). \n The third source of current pessimism about political science concerns the \ncontinuous pressure of hard-to-predict changes in human behaviour and political life. \nDevelopments from \u2018left field\u2019 continuously catch observers unawares \u2013 ranging \ndownwards in scale from the advanced industrial countries\u2019 credit crunch and \nrecession in 2008-10, through the 1989-91 collapse of the Soviet bloc, to the army \n 5 \ncoup in Thailand in September 2006. Our inability to anticipate creates a huge \ndemand for forms of study that simply document and update. Pervasive and \ncontinuous change allows \u2018collecting\u2019 tasks necessarily to absorb many energies of \npolitical scholars and it provides essential raw materials for any developed political \nscience. An \u2018\u00fcber-current affairs\u2019 can hence be alluring: \u2018A cultivated person\u2019s first \nduty is to be always prepared to rewrite the encyclopaedia\u2019 (Eco, 1999, p. 21). Yet it \nalso may conduce to the \u2018pile of stones\u2019 approach condemned by Poincar\u00e9, well \ncaptured in the distended \u2018factbook\u2019 character of most empirical textbooks, especially \nin the USA. Students would need the devotion and attention of a saint to distill from \nthem the thinnest possible gruel of theoretical ideas or systematic knowledge of how \npolitical institutions and processes work \u2013 which must then be re-extracted again in \nany new sub-field. To make matters worse, the contemporary dethroning of all kinds \nof meta-narratives (whether liberal progress myths or Marxist dialectics) seems to \nhave been widely interpreted as licensing an increasingly formless empiricism, even \nin the research literature.  \nThe increasing pace and detailing of the interaction between (especially) \nempiricist political studies and its subject matter also raises problems in an era of 24 \nhour news, exhaustive media competition, and the growth of many \u2018ideas aggregators\u2019 \n(including think tanks, \u2018public affairs\u2019 specialists, consultancies, specialist media and \nmany professions). Sifted for gold and mediated many times the collective applied \ninterpretations of political scholars may also increasingly condition the routine \nbehaviour of the parties, voters, bureaucracies and governments that they claim to \nsimply describe - social science may increasingly create phenomena, as well as study \nthem (Osborne and Rose, 1999). There is also a potential reverse process, where \nacademic research priorities are reset, creating power-suffused discourses that can \ncripple basic research, and marginalize attention for non-conforming processes and \nphenomena that cannot be easily packaged as \u2018information products\u2019 (Gouldner, 1973, \np.79). Yet there are also huge learning potentials in the effort to apply political \nscience knowledge within the state or civil society. It is only within an atheoretical, \nempiricist version of political studies that the risks of cross-contamination of \nacademic work are likely to become too high.  \n These problems - eclecticism, professional dissensus, slow discovery and \nconstant social change \u2013 are undoubtedly important and difficult. But they do not \nseem decisive in damning the project of political science. Against the first three I want \n 6 \nto follow up a suggestion of the theologian Bernard Lonergan (1971, pp. 233-4), who \nwrote: \nI wish to propose a convention. Let the term, science, be reserved for \nknowledge that is contained in principles and laws and either is verified \nuniversally or else is revised. Let the term, scholarship, be employed to denote \nlearning that consists in a commonsense grasp of the commonsense thought, \nspeech, action of distant places and\/or times. Men [or women] of letters, \nlinguists, exegetes, historians generally would be named, not scientists, but \nscholars. \n \nTo this we can add the explication of Boyer (1997), who distinguished four \ndistinct but linked scholarships, of discovery, integration, application and what he \ntermed \u2018teaching\u2019, but which I have relabelled here as \u2018renewing the profession\u2019 \n(because teaching aspects are strongly involved also in the other three strands). For \nBoyer academic discovery reflects \u2018the commitment to knowledge for its own sake, to \nfreedom of inquiry and to following, in a disciplined fashion, an investigation \nwherever it may lead\u2019 (1997, p. 17). Discovery clearly encompasses the traditional \nconcept of uncovering new scientific knowledge. But it can also involve many other \nforms of intellectual innovation, including the formulation of new theories, analyses \nand formulae, methods, philosophies, thematic ideas and memes, and the \nidentification and analysis of unique events, linkages, narratives, interpretations and \nempirical understandings.  \nBy contrast, integration is concerned with the sorting, sifting, interpretation \nand understanding of what has been discovered, with the critical academic role of \nsynthesizing, framing and fitting knowledge garnered by discovery and application \ninto a workable framework or paradigm. For Boyer (1997, p. 18) integration is \n\u2018serious, disciplined work that seeks to interpret, draw together and bring new insight \nto bear on original research\u2019. \n Boyer\u2019s \u2018scholarship of application\u2019 is concerned with the articulation of ideas \nand knowledge in ways that become useable for human purposes in myriads of \ndifferent contexts. It raises questions like: \u2018How can knowledge be responsibly \napplied to consequential problems? How can it be helpful to individuals as well as \ninstitutions?\u2019 (Boyer 1997, p. 22). Much of the \u2018rapid discovery\u2019 ethos of the physical \nsciences has in fact been sustained not by a purist pursuit of \u2018knowledge for its own \nsake\u2019, but by the industrial and professional translation of knowledge into new \ntechnologies for controlling the physical environment, engineering responses to \n 7 \nchallenges and managing medical problems. The lines from discovery to application \nhave blurred and shortened, especially in new forms of industrial development and \norganization. Some quite similar processes have occurred in the social sciences and \ncreative arts\/design (CAD) disciplines, albeit involving much tinier levels of \nresources. Even in the humanities, applications have become important in fuelling \nnew academic thought (e.g. think of the impact of genetic research on medical ethics \nand related law).  \nThe fourth type of scholarship involves renewing the profession via \ntransmitting and passing on knowledge in carefully designed and accessible forms to \nstudents and external audiences. For Boyer this \u2018is a dynamic endeavor involving all \nthe analogies, metaphors, and images that build bridges between the teacher\u2019s \nunderstanding and the student\u2019s learning.  Pedagogical procedures must be carefully \nplanned, continuously examined, and relate directly to the subject taught\u2019 (1997, p \n24). \nThis is a large landscape and there is no room for doubting that political \nscholarship (along with political science) is a legitimate and demanding area of \nspecialization. A very large proportion of \u2018discovery\u2019 work in our discipline involves \npolitical scholarship, as does much of the integration involved in building narratives \nof the unique development of different political situations and settings. This possibly \nvery specialist knowledge is what political scientists (and many others outside the \ndiscipline) rely on to make sense of our political world, to draw comparisons and form \nanalogies. And it has important implications too for the scholarship of application, an \naspect of political scholarship that has been developed in psephological, electoral and \nparty analysis, and in some \u2018advice\u2019 areas of international relations and of public \npolicy and public management.  \nBy contrast, political science as I have defined it (concerned with formulating \nlaw-like propositions and achieving universalizable forms of knowledge) is heavily \ninvolved in the scholarship of integration, although some forms of discovery (such as \nthose concerning deductive reasoning, and the development and movements of non-\ncommon sense indicators) are also important. This relative distance from discovery \nand some forms of understanding and application remains controversial with many \npolitical scholars, but it is by no means unique to political science. \u2018The sciences do \nnot try to explain\u2019, said John von Neumann (1961, p. 495), \u2018they hardly even try to \ninterpret, they mainly make models\u2019. Taking it one step further, Samuel Karlin (1983) \n 8 \nargued that: \u2018The purpose of models is not to fit the data, but to sharpen the questions\u2019 \n(quoted Buchanan, 2000, p.85).  \nYet the past concentration of political science on the scholarship of integration \nhas undoubtedly been overdrawn in other areas, especially the neglect of applications. \nIn political life application is potentially very important as a kind of \u2018discovery \nlearning\u2019, in which stimuli or interventions are made to the political world and results \nare systematically tracked and traced out. Yet political scholarship remains largely \n\u2018postdictive\u2019 not predictive: \u2018Most numbers published in political science are dead on \narrival: once printed, they are never used for anything. We can do better than that\u2019 \n(Taagepera, 2007, p. 114). Of course, the relative importance of theoretically \nestablished consequences is always a matter for empirical determination and \ninvestigation, as demonstrated in Mackie (2003)\u2019s detailed evaluation of the \nconsequential insignificance of Rikerian cycles and Arrovian impossibility proof for \nthe actually existing operations of liberal democracy. \nLooking more fundamentally, Lonergan argued rather controversially (in \nanother work) that \u2018Common sense is not concerned with the relations of things to one \nanother.. [It] has no theoretical inclinations. It remains completely in the familiar \nworld of things for us\u2019 (1958, p.175). Since Lonergan\u2019s definition above also links \nscholarship to \u2018a commonsense grasp of commonsense thought\u2019 this kind of \ncharacterization may make hackles rise. It may seem to characterize political \nscholarship as a second class form of knowledge, a set of pursuits that might not make \nit as front-rank outputs in the UK government\u2019s new Research Excellence \nFramework. \nIn fact there is no such implication here. Rather than link it to Lonergan\u2019s \n\u2018common sense\u2019, I see political scholarship as producing a high-end and specialist \nform of what Lindblom and Cohen (1979, p. 13) call \u2018ordinary knowledge\u2019, by which \nthey mean knowledge that has not been formally validated or established through \nprofessional social inquiry. \u2018Everyone has ordinary knowledge - has it, uses it, offers \nit. It is not, however, a homogenous commodity. Some ordinary knowledge, most \npeople would say, is more reliable, more probably true, than other\u2019.  In no sense am I \narguing that ordinary knowledge (or indeed even common sense) in political \nscholarship is necessarily less complicated, less intensively or systematically \nacquired, or less difficult to process and organize than is political science knowledge. \nAs Lindblom and Cohen put it the key need is to develop \u2018useable knowledge\u2019, and on \n 9 \nthese criteria the invaluable ordinary knowledge produced by political scholarship \nranks highly. \nLindblom and Cohen also stress that in understanding the social world the \nproducts of professional social inquiry (including a \u2018vanguard\u2019 political science as \ndefined here) are at best scattered pinpricks of knowledge on a large canvass whose \nmeaning must necessarily be constructed holistically. Thus political science outputs \nmust necessarily be interpreted and given meaning (by all of us in academe as much \nas by policy-makers or administrators) within a massively larger fabric of ordinary \nknowledge, much of which involves complex and esoteric narratives and \nunderstandings that are constructed (and continually re-constructed) by political \nscholarship.  \nLastly I agree with the useable knowledge idea that political scholarship and \npolitical science also stand on level grounds in deeper philosophical and \nepistemological terms (Lindblom and Cohen, 1979). There is no special authority \nclaim for professionally validated political science propositions, for several reasons. \nNot only can political science inherently never be comprehensive or self-contained, \nbut in addition, its methods cannot claim special authenticity. As Paul Valery (1970) \nsaid: \u2018\u201cScience\u201d means simply the aggregate of all the recipes that are always \nsuccessful. All the rest is literature\u2019. A political science seeking law-like propositions \nmay well face more difficulties as a result of social changes, in ways that political \nscholarship\u2019s more resilient and flexible narratives do not. Human beings always \nretain the reflexive capability to invalidate any \u2018law\u2019 governing their behaviour, \nespecially when they become aware that such a \u2018law\u2019 exists. \n The relatively slender fabric of modern political science thus stands alongside \nand depends upon the older and larger body of political scholarship, with which it \nalmost necessarily remains on level-pegging in intellectual terms. The two forms of \nactivity have different roles but an integral relationship. And given their joint under-\ndevelopment, it is no surprise that political science at least still seems to easily meet \nthe criterion suggested by Max Gluckman (1965, p. 60): \u2018A science is any discipline \nin which a fool of this generation can go beyond the point reached by the genius of the \nlast generation\u2019. \n \n \n 10 \n2.  Creating a universe of data \n \n \nWe have examined, as it were, a number of specimens, \nmarked the most important differences, arranged them in \nclasses according to these differences and given to each \nclass a name.. Now this seems to me a most important and \nnecessary part of any science of politics\u2026 \n          Sir John Seeley      6 \n \nIf there is a rule that no reflecting mind should ever forget, it \nis that comparison should be between comparable facts\u2026 \nPurely external analogies are not sufficient for building a \npositive science. \n          Jacques Novicow       7 \n \n \nIt is now more 31 years since William Anders\u2019 famous Apollo 8 \u2018earthrise\u2019 picture \nrevealed our planet as a galactic presence framed behind the alien landscape of the \nMoon, and (along with many other factors) began to change human consciousness of \nglobal phenomena in many dimensions. In political scholarship a wealth of mostly \nrather rhetorical books and papers have discussed \u2018globalization\u2019, often narrowly \nconstrued in international relations or international organization terms. But when we \nresearch the core topics of political science now \u2013 such as elections, parties, \nlegislatures, executives, policy-making, public management, sub-national \ngovernments, public policy issues, and (yes) foreign policy and international relations \n- how far can we draw upon well-ordered data sets and literatures that bring together \nand marshal for us the cumulative fruits of political scholarship\u2019s and political \nscience\u2019s activities across the whole world? What collective resources and academic \nendeavours can we point to that are globally scaled, designed and pursued without \nethno-centric assumptions, and made widely available to the scholars and political \nscientists of all countries?8 What theories and methods have we developed for \nencompassing and analysing the whole of the data-universe on political processes in \nmany diverse contexts that is out there and available to us? \nSimply framing these \u2018how far\u2019 questions is almost enough in itself to identify \nthe only plausible answer as \u2018Not much\u2019. There are many small databases of \ninformation at the cross-nation state level assembled by particular scholarly research \nteams at different periods. They are often very variably and inconsistently bounded in \n 11 \nterms of time periods, countries covered, variables included, and analyses undertaken. \nSome of these stay current for a few years, but many lapse and are discarded after a \nshort time, withering on the vine as their coverage is outclassed or their period of \ncurrency recedes into history. A very few international efforts exist to try and \nstandardize data collection, in political or electoral surveys, for instance.9 But masses \nof objective data remain uncollated. Our inherently under-scaled analysis across \ncountries almost never deploys any overall conception of global political analysis. \nInstead studies are framed within a \u2018comparative politics\u2019 (or even more restrictively, \na comparative public policy) paradigm that emphasizes all the elements included in \ncolumn I of Figure 1 below.  \n Defining what an alternative approach would look like is by no means easy. \nAs Keynes (1936, p. vii) said: \u2018The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in \nescaping from the old ones, which ramify, for those brought up as most of us have \nbeen, into every corner of our minds\u2019. However, column II shows a preliminary effort \nto sketch an alternative paradigm, which I have labelled as \u2018global political analysis\u2019. \nIt is no more than a sketch at this stage, and I can cite no supportive sources that make \nthe case for it directly, or indeed advocate anything much like it in the existing \nliterature. Nevertheless, some of the methodological building blocks for this \ndeliberately labelled \u2018sketch\u2019 are already available, and it is not simply a utopian \ndesign, but draws substance from many different pioneering studies that have \nexplored this or that particular aspect. A critic might well argue that at this stage this \nis no more than a compendium of specific remedies for the problems with the \ncomparativist paradigm identified in column I. But looking for alternative paradigms \nmust always start with accumulating puzzles and problems of some kind.  \n Since I hope that Figure 1 is fairly self-explanatory, rather than work through \nit at more length when space is already short, I hope it may be useful to instead \nconsider two more concrete cases of where standard comparativism is a contemporary \ndead-end, whatever its past achievements. Because there is no point in attacking straw \n 12 \nFigure 1: The basic pre-suppositions and set up of comparative politics, contrasted with a preliminary specification of global political \nanalysis \n \n I: Comparative politics approach II: Sketch for a global political analysis approach \n1. Underlying \nsubstantive \npremises \n(a) Nation states are (and are likely to remain) core units \nof organization in all aspects of political life and public \npolicy processes.  \n(b) World-regional and international organizations and \ninstitutions are an important overlay upon nation states, \nbut their internal operations also reflect strong nation \nstate and domestic politics influences in mediated or \nspecialized forms. \n(a) Nation states are one important level but not necessarily the \ndominant units of organizing political life. \n(b) Analyses at national level are often inappropriate for assessing \nkey propositions in political science \u2013 e.g. Duverger\u2019s Law cannot \nbe assessed using national-level election data but only in district-\nlevel analyses.  \n2. Characteristic \nunits of analysis \n(a) Nation states10 \n(b) Almost always to the exclusion of any other units of \nanalysis. \n \n(a) Aggregate national data on countries and sub-systems within \ncountries, ideally world wide but in the interim covering many \ncomparable countries \n(b) Disaggregated sub-national political contests and systems and \ngovernment\/policy systems across many (all) comparable \ncountries \n(c) Both (a) and (b) are contoured and patterned into multi-level \nformations reflecting networks, influences flows, and the \nsegmentation of sub-national areas or processes into discrete sub-\nsystems  \n(d) Massed data on sub-national events and transactions of defined \nkinds, sharing a common meaning across many (all) countries \n(e) Massed data on individual events, transactions and responses, \nagain defined and collected in common ways across many (all) \ncountries \n \n 13 \n \n I: Comparative politics approach II: Sketch for a global political analysis approach \n3. How units are \nweighted \n(a) In virtually all analyses each country counts for 1, and \nnone for more than 1, despite gross differences in the \nsize, salience and meaning of data points across \ncountries. For example, in analyses of elections or public \npolicy-making micro-states (such as Iceland, \nLuxembourg and Malta) count for 1 alongside small \ncountries (such as Singapore and Ireland), large nation \nstates like the UK or Germany, and country-world bloc \nunits like the USA with 300 million people and India or \nChina (with over a fifth of the world\u2019s population each). \n(b) Analysis relies only on including \u2018size\u2019 variables in \nregressions (along with vectors of other nationally \naveraged country characteristics) to identify  influences \narising from different country situations  \n(c) For larger states there are no controls on the \ninescapable sublimation of discrete phenomena inherent \nin \u2018averaging\u2019 across electoral districts, sub-national \npolicy systems or whatever, when using only national \ndata. \n(a) In all analyses separate data points are entered in datasets from \nthe outset to reflect all independent situations. For example, if we \njudge that India (with 1.1 billion people) includes (say) 400 \ndistinct sub-regional labour markets, then in an analysis of how \nlabour market trends affect political mobilization we include 400 \ndistinct data entries for India, as against 1 for Malta or Iceland. \nSimilarly in the USA there are (at least) 51 different prison \nsystems (one for each state plus the federal system): so in an \nanalysis of prison policy-making we need 51 different American \ndata points, against 1 for Singapore or Luxembourg. \n(b) All analysis is conditioned from the outset by the need to cover \ndifferent nation states or sub-national units that have the same \nsubstantive meanings or fundamental salience for the political or \npolicy processes being analysed - defined by core comparabilities \nof population and economic activity, the discrete determination of \noutcomes or policies, or other objectively determinable criteria. \n(c) Data are never averaged into or compared across entities that \nare fundamentally non-comparable in terms of their substantive \nmeanings, fundamental salience or role in global-scale systems. \n4. Intended scope \nof analysis \n(a) Varies from a handful of countries in qualitative work \nto larger numbers of countries (up to 70+) in quantitative \nanalyses.  \n(b) Country selections range from ad hoc justifications to \nthe maximum number of data observations reliably \ncollectable by a single research team, although often \ndrawing on other sources for individual variables such as \ncountry scorings. \n (a) The interim goal is always to marshall all available and  \nsubstantially comparable data and information.  \n(b) However, given the scale of these ambitions, sub-global \nnetworks or groupings of countries (such as the EU or APEC) may \nmake a start by covering their own world-regions, within agreed \nglobal standards.. \n 14 \n I: Comparative politics approach II: Sketch for a global political analysis approach \n5. Typical data set (a) Maybe contains 10,000 data points and covers \nperhaps 1,000 events or observation points, usually all at \nnational level. \n(b) Many datasets comparing sub-national units of \ngovernment or aggregate patterns of political behaviour \nexist for single-country studies (and some few-country \nstudies). But they are usually framed well outside any \n\u2018comparativist\u2019 perspective. \n(a) Contains from tens of thousands up to millions of data points. \n(b) Extensively covers the global or comparative analysis of data \nfor sub-national governments or political activities organized at \nsub-national scale. \n6. Dominant \nmethodological \napproaches \n(a) Quantitative analyses use \u2018single best algorithm\u2019 \ncompetitions, with only rudimentary segmentations of \ngroups of cases in the complete data set \u2013 chiefly because \nof small N problems. \u2018Root cause\u2019 and multiple causation \ntracking analyses are elementary and rely on effects \nshowing up in the single-best algorithm competitions \n(using inherently pre-averaged national data for larger \nunits). \n(b) Qualitative work uses primarily literary case studies \nof small set of countries (2 to 6), often selected on near-\nrandom or ad hoc criteria \n(a) Quantitative analysis uses diverse approaches, including \nheavily segmented analyses made possible by much large Ns, and \nhierarchical, multi-level regressions (Gelman, 2006; Gelman and \nHill, 2007, Franzese, 2005).  Expanding the sample of units \n(contests, localities, regions, countries), ideally using the universe \nof units, means that the \u2018context conditionality\u2019 of current theories \n(their \u2018scope conditions\u2019) become much more important. Theories \nthat have worked for EU or OECD countries, for instance, may not \nbe more widely applicable. A key empirical implication for \nregression analysis is a need to use more multiplicative models \n(Kam and Franzese, 2007).  \n(b) Qualitative comparative analysis (\u2018crisp set\u2019) and fuzzy set \napproaches are key methods for systematically considering \nnecessary and sufficient causes in qualitative analyses of multiple \ncases for which rich data are available (Ragin, 2000, 2003; \nRihoux, 2006).  \n \n7. Explicit or \nhidden \nmethodological \n(a) Human societies are easily categorizable (explicit \nassumption) \n(b) Macro-institutions and macro-cultural factors \n(a) Human societies are just as complex to understand as physical \nphenomena, hence the most inclusive possible universe of data is \nalways needed (explicit assumption) \n 15 \nassumptions or \ncommitments \ndetermine all major differences between nation states \n(hidden premise) \n(c)  Useful null hypotheses can be defined using ad hoc \nor \u2018ordinary knowledge\u2019. In particular, differences across \ncountry contexts can be compared in \u2018face value\u2019 \npropositions (hidden premise). \n(b) Multiple causation is pervasive in social systems and operates \non four integrated case levels (the individual, social groups, sub-\nnational communities and national society, see Sober and Wilson \n2000) as well as via single-variable level influences. \n\u2026\u2026..\/continues overleaf \n \n I: Comparative politics approach II: Sketch for a global political analysis approach \n7. Explicit or \nhidden \nmethodological \nassumptions or \ncommitments \n\u2026 \/ continued \n (c) Micro-institutions and micro-cultural factors (including near-\none-off factors) may extensively condition the influence of macro-\ninstitutions and macro-cultures, e.g. causing a general pattern of \ninfluence  to switch on or off, or even go into reverse, in particular \ncontexts (explicit assumption) \n(d) Useful null hypotheses can only be constructed via prior \ntheoretical analysis, in which apparently \u2018common sense\u2019 \nphenomena are separated into analytically comparable conditions \n(explicit assumption) \n \n \n \n 16 \nmen, I have focused on two examples of scholarly work that asks excellent questions \nand uses innovative methods, close to the forefront of standard comparativism and \nlooking across many countries.  \nA. In their classic 1979 book Seats and Votes Rein Taagepera and Mathew \nShugart sought to firm up Duverger\u2019s Law (roughly that plurality\/majority systems \ninherently tend to produce two party systems) and Duverger\u2019s Hypothesis (roughly \nthat proportional representation systems tend towards multi-partism). They showed a \nregression line based on the average national data from many countries\u2019 elections that \nseemed to integrate the Law and the Hypothesis and to give it a particular empirical \nspecification. Yet their analysis was already out of date in ignoring the point first \nmade by Aaron Wildavsky (1959) that Duverger\u2019s Law can only be tested using \ndistrict-level data. And even in 1979 it was a little crude to use national election data \nonly in a highly averaged form, generating single data points for countries\u2019 ENP \nlevels across whole periods \u2013 although this procedure has often used by other \ninfluential authors (e.g. Lijphart, 1999). \n Taagepera\u2019s 2006 book, Predicting Party Sizes pushes the research forefront a \ngood deal further on. He notes that in every election (whether in a plurality rule or PR \nsystem) there is a \u2018horse-race\u2019 tendency for voters and the media to focus on the top \ntwo parties P1 and P2, generally boosting their support at the expense of the smaller \nthird and subsequent parties (P3\u2026PN). He then energetically sets out to determine \nempirically how strong this \u2018suppressive\u2019 effect is for the P3\u2026PN parties, using data \non 652 separately entered elections across 46 countries and sophisticated estimation \nmethod producing plausible-looking effects (Taagepera, 2006, Ch.8). \n Yet the design has a fundamental problem, because of its unanalysed reliance \non the comparativist procedures in Figure 1. In many of the 46 countries covered there \nare parties with strongly regional patterns of support, either because they are explicitly \nnationalist or regionalist in their ideology, or because their support is de facto limited \nto particular areas or ethnic groups. Thus in the UK the fourth largest party from the \n1970s through to the late 1990s was the Scottish National Party, which stands only in \nScotland and hence has a maximum appeal of just 8 per cent of the UK\u2019s voters. Yet \nTaagepera uses only UK data in estimating how far the SNP\u2019s support was suppressed \nby voters\u2019 focusing on the Tory\/Labour horserace at Westminster \u2013 which inherently \nmust mis-state this effect. And what is true for the SNP is also true for all other parties \nwith regionally-limited support in the 46 country data set. By contrast if Taagepera \n 17 \nhad instead used data at election district level, his estimation approach would have \nbeen entirely appropriate and a much larger dataset would also have greatly increased \nthe accuracy of the estimated suppressive effects. \n \nB.  In The Economic Effects of Constitutions (2003) the political economists Torsten \nPersson and Guido Tabellini outclassed previous somewhat ad hoc comparative \nmodels by developing deductive economic models and tested (simplified versions of) \nthem in methodologically sophisticated regression models on a large and rich (but \nessentially standard-form) country dataset (Acemoglu, 2005). They also found a \ndramatic effect for parliamentary systems to have significantly larger public budgets \nthan presidential systems, after statistically controlling for many other influences. \nThey \u2018predict\u2019 this effect by developing a highly simplified (\u2018toy\u2019) model of the two \nsystems whose essence is as follows. In all presidential systems a single chief \nexecutive must submit to at-large election. In pursuit of maximum votes she \ninternalizes a public interest judgement and avoids beggar-my-neighbour \ndistributional policies. By contrast in a parliamentary system with a stylized three \ndistricts, there are strong incentives for a majority coalition of representative from two \ndistricts to maximize their constituents\u2019 welfare by redistributing resources from the \nconstituents of the third (losing) district. Hence, the argument goes, parliamentary \nsystems engage in more redistributive public spending. \n The chief problem here is that the standard comparativist approach has all the \nproblems identified above in column I of Figure 1, so that it is hard indeed to know \nwhat meaning to attribute to the single best algorithm outcome of the regression \nanalysis, when the underlying data points cover entities of such substantive difference. \nMore particularly, Persson and Tabellini clearly assume that the macro-institutional \ndistinction between presidential and parliamentary system makes sense in terms of \ntheir deductive and empirical models. But does it? There are anomalous \nclassifications (notably Switzerland\u2019s highly collegial executive with an annually \nrotating PM is classed as \u2018presidential\u2019 because the PM cannot be removed by \nParliament). There are very few cases of liberal democratic full presidential systems, \nand the usual problems of categorizing \u2018semi-presidential\u2019 but also parliamentary \ncountries.  \nMore seriously it is easy to point to micro-institutional effects not covered in \nthe country data that change the workings of the core \u2018toy\u2019 model in statistically \n 18 \ncritical cases. For instance, in the UK a tiny and obscure component of the House of \nCommons standing orders says that ordinary MPs can only propose any legislative \nchange that adds even an extra \u00a31 of new public spending if they have a prior \ncertificate agreeing the proposal from a minister, which is never given. From the UK \nthis provision has made its way into the constitutions of all Westminster system \ncountries, rather neatly negating the premiss of Persson and Tabellini\u2019s parliamentary \nmodel for an important sub-class of such systems. If these countries indeed spend \nmore than presidential ones (after multiple statistical controls), it is certainly not \nbecause of legislative log-rolling, which their set-up makes uniquely hard to achieve. \nMeanwhile in the USA the legislature actually dominates all the later stages of \nbudget-setting and there is abundant evidence of pork-barrel and special interest \nattachments to budget bills (especially \u2018earmarking\u2019), many of which survive rushed \nlast-minute scrutiny in Congress. Again because of micro-institutions, in a key \npresidential case (within only a small group of such countries) there is in fact the \nopposite of budgeting for at large elections. Instead, across all liberal democracies, the \nUSA is the limiting case of legislative dominance leading to common pool resource \nproblems, the polar opposite of Persson and Tabellini\u2019s deductive model. The problem \nhere is a lack of commensurability in the level of complexity between the deductive \nand empirical models and the phenomena to be explained. As Einstein once observed: \n\u2018Things should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler\u2019 (quoted, Buchanan, \n2007, p. 113). \n \n \n3. Looking deeper (in the digital era) \n \n \nLudwig Wittgenstein: \u2018Why do people say that it was natural to think  \n                                     that the sun went round the Earth, rather than  \n                                     that the Earth turned on it axis?\u2019   \nElizabeth Anscombe:  \u2018I suppose, because it looked as if the sun  \n                                     went round the earth\u2019. \nWittgenstein:                \u2018Well, what would it have looked like if it \n                                     had looked as if the earth turned on its axis?\u2019  11 \n \n \n \n 19 \nThe essential counterpart of enlarging the universe of data is to remodel political \nscience and political scholarship so as to move out from an era of data poverty and \nanalysis constraint, typified by the toy data sets and \u2018falls at the first hurdle\u2019 analysis \nof conventional comparative politics. We have all been socialized and educated on the \nmethods appropriate to scanty evidence, and much of our training has emphasized \ndata reduction to fit within the constraints of limiting methods and analysis \ntechnologies. Five specific shifts are needed, briefly explored below \u2013 becoming far \nmore attentive to theoretically informed problems and associated null hypotheses; \nembracing digital-era data-gathering; moving from sample methods to census \nmethods in analysing organizations; shifting from surveys to analysing transactional \ndata in studying mass behaviour (ideally in real time); and developing new \n\u2018instrumentation\u2019 informed by new-to-political-science theoretical perspectives.  \n \nA. Theory-framing and close analysis. We need to look much more closely at taken-\nfor-granted political phenomena, recognizing that in the physical sciences advances \nhave generally not come from grappling with \u2018things as they are\u2019. Instead scientific \nadvances have often come from small, marginal-looking or apparently esoteric \n\u2018puzzles\u2019 that only become apparent when common sense perceptions are abandoned \nfor counter-intuitive ways of seeing. Thus it may seem obvious that the sun revolves \naround the earth; that feathers inherently fall to earth more slowly than lead weights; \nor that if I stand on a plain and drop a bullet from my hand it will reach the earth \nsooner than a bullet fired horizontally from a gun in my other hand - but none of these \nstrong \u2018appearances\u2019 is correct (Wolpert, 1989. p.3). Yet core propositions in political \nscience, such as Duverger\u2019s Law, continue to be framed in common sense terms that \ncannot be precisely operationalized (as I show below). Hence they are amenable to \nmultiple redefinitions and a continuously expanded insulation against falsification.12 \nFor political science the core of an effort to look deeper must be to produce \ntheory and collect data in ways that continuously sets observation of what actually \noccurred in a given situation within a theoretical and empirical \u2018field\u2019 of what might \nhave happened. The meaning of events can only be determined within an account that \ntakes cognizance of other possible outcomes, using some knowledge of what \nwould\/might have happened anyway to track down the impacts of particular \ninstitutions, strategies or political interventions. \u2018History is the science of things \nwhich are never repeated\u2019, said Paul Valery.13 But being able to write some elements \n 20 \nof \u2018counterfactual history\u2019 and to tell what is or is not repeated (and at what level) is \npart of what makes political science far more than history. This may seem difficult to \ndo, yet it is one of the main contributions made by (say) game theory applications to \nhistory. (For instance, Josep Colomer\u2019s  (1995) account of the series of decisions \nunderlying the Spanish transition to democracy demonstrates clearly the contribution \nthat political science can make compared with conventional political scholarship). We \nneed to show, as T.S. Elliot put it in Four Quartets (p.14), that:  \n\u2018What might have been, and what has been \n  Point to one end, which is always present\u2019. \n \nTo give another apparently simple but actually rather fundamental example, \nwe can only begin to assess the impact of an electoral system on how voters choose \nbetween parties if we know something of the preference structures of voters, and \nhence what they were trying to achieve with their vote, and what they might have \ndone differently in other circumstances (Saari, 1995). Yet Mackie (2003, pp. 86-92) \npoints out that it is in fact rather dubious that we have ever empirically recovered a \ncomplete set of preference orderings from any group of \u2018real life\u2019 (as opposed to \nhypothetical) voters. In the UK successive electoral surveys funded at public expense \nfor a long period recovered only first preferences, a practice that opinion polls \nmaintain even now \u2013 while academic elections surveys still do not go beyond poorly \nrecording first and second preferences (Dunleavy, 2005).  Inherently circular concepts \nlike \u2018party identification\u2019 also inhibited for decades at a time attempts to map voters\u2019 \ncomparative evaluations and perceptions of parties. As a result we have only \nfragmentary evidence of UK voters\u2019 preference orderings, a pattern that Mackie finds \nreplicated across many countries. \n Pursuing this example a little further, how far can we construe election \noutcomes in terms of propositions like Duverger\u2019s Law (DL)? A few analysts have \nabandoned the self-limiting comparativist obsession with national-level election data, \nand instead examined the evidence at the correct election district level. In a hugely \nnoteworthy study Chhibber and Kolman (1998) compared plurality rule outcomes in \nIndia and the USA (later extended to cover the UK and Germany also). Yet in the \ncourse of the analysis their key test somehow gets coarsened into determining whether \nthe effective number of parties is below 2.5 in a district (judged DL-consistent) or \nabove it (judged DL-inconsistent) (Chhibber and Kolman, 2004, p. 48). For US \nCongressional elections though there are often only two candidates and very rarely \n 21 \nmore than three candidates, making looking at ENPs only an exercise in book-keeping \ntautology. If only two candidates contest an election, the ENP must be below 2, since \nof 50 possible positive integer outcomes only one (50, 50) yields this result. If three \ncandidates contest an election and all parties gain positive integer levels of support, \nthere are 834 possible outcomes when we rank the parties P1, P2 and P3 in order of the \nsize of their vote. Only one slot (34, 33, 33) can generate a perfect ENP score of 3, \nwhile 345 slots generate ENP scores of 2 or less. By failing to set the empirical \noutcomes recorded within any consideration of what could inherently occur in US \nCongressional contests, Chhibber and Kolman end up with no null hypothesis at all. \nIn company with many previous researchers into Duverger\u2019s Law, they have no way \nof separating out what is a substantive empirical outcome from what is necessarily \nbound to happen, given the initial structure of a candidate race (Dunleavy et al, \n2008a). \n \nB. Embracing the digital era. The research methods textbooks and most professional \npractice in political science and political scholarship have so far barely registered the \ncontextual changes in information and analytic technologies now available as a result \nof social processes moving online. Some of the most consequential political thought \nof the modern era (by IT gurus and engineers) has also been ignored (see Brate, \n2002). Yet the cumulation of digital era changes has dramatic consequences, \nthreatening to create our own \u2018slow-boiled frog\u2019 problem. \nIn advanced industrial countries every salient political organization is now on \nthe internet in some form, and their web sites, transactional systems, forums, blogs \nand other elements are largely open for inspection. Their websites at least (but not \nintranets) can also be systematically crawled for information, although this needs to \nbe done slowly because anti-virus software will repel attempts to fast-crawl a site (see \nEscher et al, 2006; Petriceck et al, 2006). Sophisticated network techniques can then \nbe used to analyse the \u2018graph structure\u2019 in the web data. Essentially how the \norganization communicates with citizen, businesses, civil society or other government \nor political bodies is fully open for analysis by political scientists.  \nOf course, what the organization says online it is doing, and what the \norganization actually is doing may vary, and many political scholars have accordingly \ndismissed websites as sources of information, as simple public relations \u2018fronts\u2019 for \norganizations. There is a potential problem here, but in fact it is relatively easily \n 22 \nmanaged in most areas of political science, as Figure 2 shows. For online methods to \nwork it is important that the vast bulk (say 95 per cent) of all organizational situations \nwill be covered by the shaded cells 1 and 3, where an organizational is either doing a \nlot or a little, and its web presence (when critically assessed using online research \napproaches) accurately reveals that situation.  \n \nFigure 2: Organizations underlying pattern of activities and their online \npresence \n Organization is actually doing \nOrganization represents \nitself online as doing \n \nA lot \n \nNot much \n \nA lot \n1. Web census analysis \ncorrectly identifies high \nactivity situation \n \n2. Fa\u00e7ade activity \n \nNot much \n \n4. Organizations with \n\u2018stealth\u2019 activities \n3. Web census analysis \ncorrectly identifies low \nactivity situation \n \nThe two other possibilities would represent problems, if they are widespread \nand cannot be detected. \u2018Fa\u00e7ade\u2019 activity online might mask underlying inactivity (or \nactivity of a different kind) by the organization (cell 2). Yet this situation is actually \nmuch harder for an organization to sustain than might appear \u2013 because virtually all \nsignificant organizations\u2019 web operations are now so salient, complex and interlocked \nwith their fundamental transactions systems and ways of working. Essential business \nprocesses operate via the internet (not just press releases or creating a public relations \ngloss); web-sites are too expensive to maintain properly simply for propaganda \npurposes; and fa\u00e7ade content is anyway clearly visible for researchers (see Figure 3 \nbelow), and indeed any serious user.14 The whole concept of \u2018digital-era governance\u2019 \nstresses that increasingly government bureaucracies are becoming their websites, so \nthat the organizational socio-technical system is increasingly manifest on the web. \nIndeed it has to be completely manifest or modern pared-down, system of risk-\nadjusted administration will collapse (Dunleavy, et al, 2008b). Increasingly critical \ngovernment-to-citizen and government-to-business processes are necessarily going to \nbe online \u2013 for instance, in the UK for the first time a majority of self-assessment tax \nreturns were submitted online in 2009. And everywhere in the advanced industrial \nworld social security systems are following tax collection online (Dunleavy et al, \n2008c, 2009). The same degree of integral linkage between organizational form and \n 23 \nonline processes has also developed amongst interest groups, charities and most civil \nsociety organizations.  \n Of course, there are organizations and places that are exceptions (for a time). \nOnline processes have probably had least impact on political parties, because political \nleaderships are often been non-tech in their approach and the parties still maintain \nsome degree of organizational separateness (i.e. opaqueness) as an (increasingly \nfailing) incentive to membership. Yet even here, blogging makes intra-party linkages \nand opinion movements clearer and more traceable than ever before, internet fund-\nraising has transformed political finance and internet presence has transformed \nleadership selection processes (Margetts, 2006). \nNor is any of this to deny that some culturally-conservative political \norganizations (especially government bureaucracies) may lag well behind the digital-\nera curve, in many cases quite dramatically. In 2008, for instance, the UK\u2019s \nDepartment of Work and Pensions had 195 million customer contacts, of which less \nthan half of one per cent were online contacts at this time. Put another way, it took the \nDWP\u2019s 108,000 civil servants on average four months to process one email or online \napplication (Dunleavy et al, 2009). Yet this conservatism and slowness of response is \nitself all perfectly trackable using online research methods. \nThe last problem in Figure 2 concerns cell (4) covering organizations with \nlarge-scale \u2018stealth\u2019 activities, who are doing things politically or delivering public \nservices, but not telling citizens or talking about it on the web. Yet who exactly are \nthese bodies? Certainly this is irrational behaviour for any citizen-facing or business-\nfacing public service bureaucracy in an advanced industrial country, and for most \ninterest groups, civil society organizations and parties also \u2013 to be implementing \nactivities yet masking this from the public and society. Only a few special purpose \nagencies (such as intelligence services and defence agencies) and their opponents in \nterrorist organizations may actually have critically important classes of activity \nshielded from web revelation. Even police services and foreign affairs ministries must \nincreasingly operate on the Internet, or risk being marginalized from society\u2019s key \ninformation networks (Hood and Margetts, 2007; Escher et al, 2006). Similarly many \nmodern terrorist movements rely extensively on online sites to raise funds, maintain \nbroadcast communications, distribute ideological memes and provide for decentred \npatterns of cell organization (Burke, 2004, p. 39). \n \n 24 \nC. Moving from reactive sample methods to non-reactive web census and other online \nmethods. Samples and sampling systems for social research were developed from the \n1940s and substantially refined by the 1970s. In our field they were chiefly designed \nto allow us to \u2018read\u2019 mass behaviour by looking only at the small amounts of research \ndata that we could feasibly collect or analyse. Sampling theory and significance tests \nwere key in this approach, to ensure that the sample was representative and random, \nand to guard against the potential for mistakes in inferring from the sample to the \nwider population. Sampling theory remains the basis for almost all our data analysis \nmethods in quantitative research. Yet now digital era changes have undermined many \nof the assumptions that underlie our previous methodological thinking. \nA key way of analysing websites, again as yet completely uncovered in \nresearch methods textbooks, is to use web census methods (WCM), which now \nconstitute a credible alternative to survey- or interview-based approaches in \norganizational research (see Figure 3). Non-reactive approaches can now create \ncomplete and rich organizational data about whole classes of organizations via desk \nresearch, reliably and quickly. And \u2018fuzzy set\u2019 methods can then tackle the analysis of \ngenuinely complex multiple causation (Ragin, 2000, 2003). The combined results \nnormally outclass both reactive sample surveys and in depth case studies. Why \nsample, when you can conduct a comprehensive census? Why worry about many \naspects of conventional statistical significance, if you can include the whole \npopulation in your datasets from the outset (also avoiding all missing case problems)? \nWhy base analysis on a handful of cases (left largely un-situated in the wider field of \nall similar organizations) when you can cover them all, in detail? This basic shift of \napproach can be easily varied and extended in numerous ways \u2013 for example, using \nexternal or internal search engines and specialist media tracker sites to track the foci \nof memes in macro-content through their incidence in discourses; crawling websites \nfor in and out linkages (Escher et al, 2006); and using modern networking analysis to \ntrack influences (Fowler and Jean, 2008; Cho and Fowler, 2007; Christakis and \nFowler, 2008). \n 25 \nFigure 3: Comparing surveys of organizations and web census methods (WCM) \n Surveys of organizations Web census methods (WCM) \nCoverage A statistically representative \nsample, covering a fraction of \nthe whole population of \norganizations. \nThe whole population of \norganizations. \nInstrument \ndefined by \nResearchers define a strictly \nlimited number of questions. \nQuestion wording effects \nextensively condition subjects\u2019 \nresponses. Any incorrect or \ninappropriate single question \nwordings contaminate \nsignificant sections of analysis \nand results. \nResearchers identify a large \nnumber (several dozen to \nhundreds) of discrete items to be \ncoded as present or not. Items are \nstructured and weighted to tap \ntheoretically relevant dimensions. \nAny single incorrect item has a \ntiny impact on overall indices. \nType of \nmethods \napproach \nReactive methods (surveys, \ninterviews) \u2013 those contacted \nmay report erroneously, edit \ntheir responses or misrepresent \nsituations. \nNon-reactive methods \u2013 items are \ncoded as objectively present\/ \nabsent in the organizations\u2019 \nwebsites, using simple \ndichotomies \nResearcher-\nsubject \ninteractions \nObtrusive \u2013 respondents know \nthe study is under way and the \nprecise content of its questions \nUnobtrusive \u2013 organizations need \nnot be alerted that a study is under \nway \nCosts Substantial Low \nKey \u2018meaning\u2019 \nproblems \nResponses may be artefacts of \nthe questions asked.

The effects of \ninterviewer and coder \njudgements may be hard to \nspot or control for.  \nOrganizational behaviours are \nestablished, but the salience and \nmeaning of items coded may be \ndisputed (at both an individual \nand an aggregate level). \n \nKey problems \nwith \ninterpreting the \ninformation \ngathered \nWho exactly in the \norganization completes and \nreturns surveys varies a lot, \nand may not be known.

Mistakes \nand mis-codings can be post-\ncorrected by researchers. \n 26 \nD. Tackling transactions and events data.  \nShifting social organization online has also created new datasets of mass transactions \nand events. In government, enormous transactions databases have also cumulated in \nsocial security, tax, immigration, health, educational and other bureaucracies \n(Dunleavy et al, 2008, Chs 6-8). More broadly:  \n\u2018Digitization and the cheap storage of phenomenal amounts of data (constantly \nproduced by cheaper processing power following Moore\u2019s Law) have greatly \nchanged the economics of analysing large volumes of information. Massive \ndata warehousing operations have become central processes in sectors like the \nfinancial industry, stock markets, retailing, the travel industry, telephony, ISPs \nand increasingly digital commerce and burgeoning digital distribution \nnetworks for text, sound, and now video products. Companies have also \ncreated so-called \u2018super-crunching\u2019 methods for analyzing these huge volumes \nof data (Ayres, 2008)\u2026. In the space of a few years, companies with pervasive \ninformation about their operations and markets have moved from the pages of \nscience fiction towards actuality, with the growth of what Thrift (2005) calls \n\u2018knowing capitalism\u2019 \u2013 a strong concentration of societal information in the \nhands of the most advanced businesses\u2019 (LSE Public Policy Group, 2008, p. \n28). \n \nWeakly organized and highly siloed on discipline lines as we are, social \nscientists currently have very little access to these commercial or governmental \ntransactional databases. Yet they are a critical source of far more detailed insights into \nsocial processes than we can muster\u2013 a development that has thrown some observers \ninto near-despair. Savage and Burrows (2007 and 2009) predict \u2018the coming crisis in \nempirical sociology\u2019 when companies like Amazon, Google, Tesco or Boots in the \nUK, or in the USA Walmart, dispose of far more information about the cultural tastes, \ndietary behaviours and health conditions of the population than anything that \nacademic sociology can assemble (Webber, 2009). They see a \u2018danger [of sociology] \ntaking refuge in the reassurance of our own internal world, our own assumed abilities \nto be more \u201csophisticated\u201d, and thereby we chose to ignore the huge swathes of \n\u201csocial data\u201d that now proliferate\u2019 (2007, p. 887). The same syndrome applies also in \npolitical science.  \nAgain, mass surveys are likely to be a key casualty. Figure 4 compares the \ncomparative efficacy of survey-based date-seeking about mass social behaviour with \nthe insights offered by the analysis of transactional and events data that is now \nachievable in the digital era. The ability to study behaviour directly (instead of just \ninferred behaviours based on reactive responses) is a key advantage in column 2 here. \n 27 \nIn public policy and public management, transactions data show the same events \nsequences between citizens and government repeated numerous times, giving rise to \nvery many but still finite patterns, and allowing us to segment interactions into \nmultiple different categories and sub-categories. \u2018The sample survey is not a tool that \nstands \u201coutside history\u201d. Its glory years, we contend, are in the past\u2019 Savage and \nBurrows (2007, p. 890). (For related debates see Crompton, 2008: Stanley, 2008). \nSo the challenge for all the social sciences is to act together (or fail apart) so as \nto secure access to government-held or corporate-held transactional databases, and to \ntake forward the study of bureaucracy and governance in new ways. Unless we can \nsucceed there will be a real threat of obsolescence to older and more conventional \nforms of political scholarship, of which some earlier signs can already be detected.15 \nHowever, even while we must address these thorny problems of professional \ncollective action, a vanguard political science (as I have sketched it here) can also \nmake major advances in framing research questions in the digital era by defining \ninnovative methods and achieving new applications.  \nFor example, the difficulty and time lags involved in accumulating over-time \nmemberships or activity levels in interest groups mean that we have only isolated \nstudies of their dynamics (see Hansen 1985, 1991). Yet now these dynamics more \npublic and measurable on the internet. We also have the political equivalent of fruit \nflies in biology \u2013 short-lived collective mobilizations online, which allow us to study \nmany iterations of different group dynamics. Thus Margetts and colleagues (2009) \nanalysed the jump points when petitions on the 10 Downing Street website take off \nand reach critical mass or not, and the factors that are associated with them. Many \nrepetitions of such real-time dynamics offers us a window into processes where \nprevious research has generated few insights. \n \n 28 \nFigure 4: Comparing mass surveys and the analysis of transactional data \n Surveys of mass behaviour Transactional data \nCoverage A statistically representative \nsample, covering a tiny fraction \nof the relevant population. \nAll relevant transactions.  \nInstrument \ndefined by \nAs in Figure 3.

New instrumentation informed by new theory. Specifying problems theoretically \nand placing a premium on close analysis are important because they hang together as \na syndrome (just as much broad brush political scholarship \u2018hangs together\u2019 with \ncommon sense or ad hoc framings of problems \u2013 see Morton, 1999). The physical \nsciences made much of their early progress through the accurate classification and \nmeasurement of phenomena, the analysis of apparently small anomalies and \u2018weak \nsignals\u2019, and the interaction of many different (\u2018swarms of\u2019) methods, practices, and \nways of seeing (Gribbin, 2003). Although most people think of Thomas Kuhn\u2019s \nscientific paradigms approach as concerning only macro-scale, worldview changes, in \nfact he stressed that changes take place on many levels and often in small sub-sets or \ncommunities of researchers: \u2018Paradigms are accepted examples of actual scientific \npractice \u2013 examples which include law, theory, application, and instrumentation \ntogether \u2013 providing models from which spring particular coherent traditions of \nscientific research\u2019 (Kuhn, 1996, p.10). \n Our basic data in political science remain widely inadequate partly because \nthere is almost a disdain in the discipline for instrumentation or theory without \nimmediate accompanying evidence of its utility in addressing problems at the \ncommon-sense level. The reaction against public choice theory\u2019s heyday period of \nover-modelling and its close analogies to \u2018autistic economics\u2019 has been for \ncontemporary journal editors to demand of any innovation an immediate empirical \napplication. Some of the current malaise in political scholarship and political science \nreflects a hard-to-avoid scissors tackle. On the one hand, large areas of political \nscholarship appear to display a near-fatalistic methods complacency, especially on \nindices. The implied stance seems to be: \u2018What\u2019s wrong with a \u201cbog standard\u201d \napproach\u2019? Consider, for instance, the effective number of parties: the index has some \nkey and known deficiencies (Dunleavy and Bouceck, 2003) but it continues to be very \nwidely used as almost the only index measure of party systems in comparative \nresearch. On the other hand, many scholars who think of themselves as being at the \n\u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018techno\u2019 end of the discipline apparently believe that progress can be best \nachieved by a premature push for \u2018normal science\u2019 closure to new theories, methods \nand critiques. This is accompanied by a kind of misplaced \u2018physics envy\u2019 that stresses \naccuracy in the analysis of data that yet remain fundamentally flawed (as in newer \npolitical economy approaches to comparative politics). \n 30 \n By contrast it seems to me that there are many areas of political science where \nnew theories and associated new methods and analysis techniques are badly needed \nand where a wider range of fruitful, \u2018post-rational choice\u2019 building blocks are already \nin place, including agent-based models (Laver and Sergenti, no date; Laver and \nSchilperoord, 2007), network analysis (Cho and Fowler, 2007), biological models \n(Kremer and Olken, 2009), behavioural economics and more. Take, for instance, the \nanalysis of collective action problems in the light of modern advances in theory. A \nlong-standing strand in political science and scholarship discusses the \u2018democratic \nmyth\u2019 that leads big majorities of ordinary voters in surveys to declare that their votes \nare important and that they personally can influence the results of large elections \n(Dunleavy and Margetts, 1995). Of course, as professionals we know better, whether \nwe are teaching rational choice 101 or psephologically separating out marginal from \nsafe seats. Individual voting may be normatively desirable and collectively influential, \nour professional consensus goes, but it is almost always individually negligible in its \nimpacts. \n Yet the classical models of probability on which such views depend are now \nsomewhat under siege by newer approaches. Network analysis and \u2018small worlds\u2019 \ntheories predict that individual voters have more extensive influence (Watts and \nStrogatz, 1998). And some empirical evidence supports the claim in US elections \n(Fowler, 2005). It is clearly much more complex to chart and assess influence flows \nthan statistically calculating objective probabilities (or than just guessing at 1\/N \nimpacts). Suppose we have a grid of small and local influence flows, such as voters \ndiscussing politics with their nearest and dearest, plus a few work colleagues and pub \nfriends. It might seem cripplingly unlikely that the micro-stimulus of one individual\u2019s \ndecisions or opinions could spread very far in such a \u2018small worlds\u2019 set-up. And so \nwherever we see a large-scale change conventional analysts are inclined to reach for \nmacro-level stimuli (such as an initiative by parties or politicians or coverage by \nwidely-seen media) as the cause. But in fact it may be perfectly feasible to achieve \npervasive coverage or knowledge of particular micro-stimuli across a \u2018small worlds\u2019 \nelectorate, so long as a minimum number of random (or near-random) links exist that \nare non-local and that communicate information between otherwise unconnected parts \nof the grid . Depending on the particular set-up of a situation, in simulations the \ndensity of non-local links needed can be very low while the system coverage achieved \ncan be very high. In business the concept of \u2018viral marketing\u2019 exploits this \n 31 \nphenomenon, and in the digital era the commercial viability of such approaches and \nthe importance of tipping points are obvious to the mass readership of \u2018pop science\u2019 \nbooks (Watts, 2003; Gribbin, 2009; Buchanan, 2000).  \n Similarly the concept of \u2018self-organized\u2019 criticality argues that physical and \nnatural systems may often exist in a condition where they are continuously on the \nedge of dramatic changes in response to small stimuli, even though most of the time \nsmall stimuli only have small effects. For instance, suppose we set up an experiment \nthat randomly drops rice-grains across a surface to create a variably shaped pile of \ngrains.16 The pile will get steeper until a slope is reached that is not sustainable and a \nslippage of grains will occur, most often only a small adjustment but occasionally a \nmajor landslide that radically reshapes the topography of the pile. The system will \nrecurringly move back into the same condition of self-organized criticality in which it \nis not possible to anticipate or predict what kind or order of magnitude of slippage \nwill occur next (Brunk, 2000 and 2001).  \nNow just as rice grains will pile into slopes systems that are susceptible to big \nadjustments unpredictably, the same may often be true also of human social \norganization. In economics the implications may be that market models based around \nGaussian distributions need to be radically rethought, and that major crises such as the \ncredit crunch near-collapse of the world\u2019s financial systems in autumn 2008 need to \nbe re-factored into all our thinking (Mandelbrot and Taleb, 2006; Taleb, 2007). \nStatistical models better adjusted to \u2018power law\u2019 phenomena and \u2018thick tail\u2019 \ndistributions may be far more applicable in social systems and political processes than \nwe have thought.17  \nFlip back to the collective action problem though and perhaps what voters \nespousing the \u2018democratic myth\u2019 have been telling us all these years in survey \nresponses is that the electoral competition between parties (both in close-fought and in \npotential \u2018landslide\u2019 elections) is a finely poised system in a self-organized critical \nstate, where any small input can potentially make a big difference. Indeed, many such \ncases may be happening on many different scales already, but being mutually offset or \nbounded in most cases. (How would we know, given the current quality of our data \nand methods?) So voters might need very low levels of influence in networks to make \nit individually worthwhile for them to vote, effectively taking out insurance against \nmissing their chance to help forward a large change that they favour, or to bound or \noffset a big change from elsewhere that would be adverse to their interests. This is \n 32 \nespecially true when we remember that at the group level those who systematically do \nnot vote will almost certainly see state power wielded by others, perhaps often against \ntheir interests.  \n \n \nConclusions \n A political science orientated to developing general laws and generic knowledge \ndepends on and may well always rest upon a broader foundation of political \nscholarship that builds up \u2018ordinary knowledge\u2019 of \u2018things for us\u2019. Political science is \nan integrated body of thought concerned primarily with Boyer\u2019s scholarship of \nintegration, and to a lesser degree with his scholarships of discovery and application. \nThat does not mean that political science can or should be a high consensus area on \nthe physical science model \u2013 for as William Blake noted \u2018without contraries, there is \nno progress\u2019 (quoted, Paulin, 2007). However, a political science conceived in this \nway has a good chance of developing a rapidly moving knowledge frontier, even \nwhile political scholarship more broadly continues to absorb ever-changing political \ndevelopments, to regenerate and innovate in the light of them, and to reinterpret the \ncanon of conventional political thought. \nTwo major areas of change seem to be needed. First, we need to ditch \ncomparative politics as a time-limited conception \u2013 one that contentedly accepts a \nhabitat of toy models analysing toy data sets with known and evident (\u2018Emperor\u2019s \nnew clothes\u2019) defects, which cannot be corrected or compensated even by the most \nsophisticated statistical methods. We need to form a clear ambition to pull together \nand analyse political changes at the most inclusive (ideally global) level, creating \nlarge-scale data sets that escape from the prison of \u2018nation state primacy\u2019 assumptions, \nand can be analysed at highly disaggregated levels and as a product of multi-level \ncausation flows.  \nAllied with this must be a broadening and sharpening of political science to \nfocus on problems that are deep-constituted by theory, framed in more carefully-\ndefined operational terms, situated within appropriate theoretical and empirical \n\u2018fields\u2019 of possibilities, addressed with new instrumentation and open to being \ninfluenced by new-to-political-science theories. Transitioning into digital-era methods \nalso means reducing our dependence on reactive methods, especially sample surveys, \nin favour of non-reactive methods, especially web-census methods in organizational \n 33 \nanalysis and a focus on large transactional databases for studying mass behaviours \nand event processes. \nThis is a big agenda to tackle and it will require concerted collective action \namongst political scientists and scholars, and often across the social sciences \ndisciplines, to accomplish.  But some key foundations for change are already in place. \nAnd with many established areas of our discipline already operating under the \nlooming threat of intellectual or methodological obsolescence, the challenge to raise \nour game by innovating is unavoidable. \n \n 34 \nReferences \n \nAnscombe, G.E.M. 1959.

Minkin\u2019s book has much to offer any serious \npolitical scientist. \n2   http:\/\/en.wikiquote.org\/wiki\/Hal_Abelson  Abelson is a well-known computer \nscientist at MIT.  \n3  Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1901), Ch. 9: \u2018Hypotheses in Nature\u2019. \n \n4    Miligan (2002), p. 294. This quote is the Envoi of a poem (called \u2018England Home \nand Beauty for Sale\u2019) about UCL architects putting up low-grade buildings in \nBloomsbury. \n \n5    STEM means science (including medicine), technology, engineering and \nmathematics.  \n \n6  Seeley, 1896, p. 361.  \n \n7  Novicow (1910) quoted in Pichot (2009), p. 31. \n \n8  Ethno-centrism in political science is hard to combat, especially in the dominant US \nprofession where an almost unchanging, single-country network of PhD institutions \n 41 \n                                                                                                                                            \ndominates recruitment (Fowler et al, 2007) and a \u2018science of American politics\u2019 can \nstill be taken seriously. Senior US figures still often talk and write unreflectively, as \nin: \u2018The cold war\u2019s end has been followed by an unprecedented wave of \ndemocratization and marketization, and the extension of American political, cultural, \nand economic practices around the globe\u2019 (Schapiro and Deo, 2008, p.1, my italics).  \n \n9    One of the best-organized and most successful co-operative groups creating \ndisaggregated many-country datasets is the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems \n(CSES), on which see Vowles (2009). By contrast, the International Political Science \nAssociation, the American Political Science Association and the European \nConsortium of Political Research, and other powerful country-level political science \nassociations in the UK, Japan and elsewhere have done nothing effective in this key \narea. \n \n10   Landman and Robinson (2009)\u2019s Sage Handbook of Comparative Politics notes \nthat:  \n\u2018Today comparativists engage in the quantitative comparison of many \ncountries, qualitative and quantitative comparison of few countries and \nquantitative analysis conducted in single countries. These comparisons \ntypically use the nation state and annual observation as the basic unit of \nanalysis\u2026\u2019 (p.3).  \nGoogle Books\u2019 analysis of this text shows that across its 509 pages (at least 350,000 \nwords), the many authors here mention \u2018local\u2019 anything 37 times, \u2018sub-national\u2019 \nanything 10 times, and \u2018multi-level\u2019 anything just three times.  \n  \n11     Anscombe, 1959, p. 52. I have put her account of the conversation into a \ndialogue form here and omitted the commentary on both participants\u2019 non-verbal \nbehaviour. I am very grateful to Keith Dowding for drawing this quotation to my \nattention. \n \n12   Looking across modern physics and chemistry journals Colomer (2007, p. 134) \nhighlights three parallel lessons for political science: \u2018Variables should be well \ndefined and measurable; the relationships between variables may be non-linear; the \ndirection of causality should be clearly identified and not assumed on a priori \ngrounds\u2019. \n \n13   Paul Valery, Vari\u00e9t\u00e9 IV, quoted in (Buchanan, 2000), p. 1. \n14    Suppose, for instance, that a city local government wants to represent itself as \nhaving a joined-up approach to services for the elderly, when in fact its provision \nremains resolutely siloed, limited and under-funded. It can certainly draft up some \nnice pages of plausible pictures and high-sounding goals, but it cannot then back up \nthis misleading gloss with all the necessary in-depth website provision needed, nor \nkeep it up to date. If in fact the city has only weak links (or no links) with local health \nservices, the social security department or the housing and transport sections, this will \nquickly become apparent to anyone trying to secure some help for themselves or an \naged relative. Contradictions and loose connections that may not be obvious to a \ncausal website visitor, clicking through in two or three minutes, are immediately \nvisible on closer inspection \u2013 especially by a trained researcher spending an hour on \nthe website. Figure 3 also shows how the actual integration of services can be mapped \n 42 \n                                                                                                                                            \nby evaluating and coding dozens of objective indicators. \n \n15   Cohen (2009) explains a legislative move by an Oklahoma senator to ban US \npolitical science from receiving National Science Foundation grants. \n \n16   Per Bak (1997) famously argued in terms of a theoretically-specified hypothetical \nand pile. But empirically it turns out that sand piles are more Gaussian and do not in \nfact develop self-organized criticality - whereas rice piles do. \n \n17  Some early applications have been made in political science, such as Baumgarter \nand Jones (2009); and John and Margetts, (2003). \n"}
