The objective was to assess the accessibility of WebCT for people with\ndisabilities - sensory, cognitive and physical. The guidelines provided by the World Wide\nWeb Consortium (W3C) (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0, http:\/\/www.\nw3.org\/Tr\/WAI-WEBCONTENT), checking mechanisms including the Bobby Web\npage analysis tool, developed by CAST (http:llcast.org\/bobbyl), and learner centred\ndesign methods provided the basis for the evaluation. The approach involved extensive\nevaluation of existing courses by the researcher, discussion with and survey of WebCT\ndesigners, and the involvement of students with disabilities through interview and focus\ngroups. Issues considered include: the provision of alternative information; structure,\npresentation and organization of content and navigational elements; and accessibility\nwith assistive technologies.\nThe results reveal that many barriers to accessibility can be overcome through awareness\nof design issues, and that there is a need for practical advice for academics. The aim is to\npresent a case study of best practice in the design of accessible courseware incorporating\ndesign strategies that will enable students with various disabilities to take advantage of\nthe 'just in time, just for me' approach.\n17\nElaine J. Pearson andTony Koppi Inclusion and online opportunities: designing for accessibility\nIntroduction\nDevelopments in online learning can present opportunities for a more inclusive education\nfor students with disabilities. Online learning facilitates real flexibility in the time and place\nfor learning; independence is increased through the availability of online learning\nresources, and there is less reliance on the assistance of helpers such as library staff or\nnote-takers. The ability to submit work electronically can release the students from the\ncosts in time and resources in obtaining physical access. Communication can be improved\n- computer technology can give voice to those without, both literally and figuratively.\nCommunication devices such as chat rooms, discussion groups and email can enable\nstudents to participate without prejudice or embarrassment.\nThe same developments, however, can also pose further barriers to those with disabilities.\nWeb-based learning materials tend to be heavily text-based, and students may have\ndifficulty in reading or comprehending text or distinguishing colours. Many have difficulty\nwith organization, structure or memory, they may find material difficult to navigate, poorly\nstructured or complex, or the interface may be inconsistent. Students with mobility\nproblems, limited motor control or vision impairment may not be able to use a keyboard or\nmouse. The increasing use of multimedia can be beneficial in providing an enriched\nenvironment, but it can also be a barrier to those who cannot see or hear audio, video and\nanimations. Furthermore, the growth in overseas students and distance learning means\nthat there are increasing numbers who may not be fluent in the language of instruction.\nThe trend towards development of courses and resources online with the support of a\nvirtual learning environment (VLE) such as WebCT and Blackboard presents both\nopportunities and challenges in the creation of flexible, informative and accessible\neducational materials. Part of the challenge is to provide opportunities to the individuals\nof a wide and varied community, some of whom might not otherwise be able to participate\nin higher education. People with disabilities face particular barriers to inclusion and the\nmove to online learning may facilitate the lifting of some of these barriers.\nThere is an increasing awareness of the need to make Web sites accessible to everyone\nregardless of ability\/disability, with a legal imperative coming from the Disability\nDiscrimination Acts in the United Kingdom (http:\/\/www.disability.gov.uk\/index.html) and\nAustralia (http:\/\/www.deet.gov.aularchiveliaelanalysislddaedcon.htm), and the Disabilities\nAct (http:\/\/www.wrightslaw.com\/info\/section504.ada.peer.htm) in the United States.\nGuidelines, including Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (W3C), and 'Web\naccessibility resources: quick tips to make Web sites accessible' (http:\/\/genasys.usm.mame.\nedulaccess.htm) exist to aid developers of Web sites, and an increasing number of sites\ndisplay the 'Bobby Approved' logo.\nHowever, learning environments and resources for online teaching have other requirements\nfor accessibility beyond functional considerations and the use of 'ALT' (alternative text)\ntags. Care needs to be taken with the navigation, structure, content design and\ncommunication aspects, and learner-centred design is crucial to ensure that online learning\nis accessible to students with disabilities.\nMost discipline-based academic course developers are stretched to keep abreast of\ntechnical developments. Often online courseware development is carried out in addition to\ntheir normal workload and they have little time to learn programming skills or understand\nthe technical terminology used in many of the guidelines, such as those provided by W3C.\n18\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 2\nTeaching with technology is not something that can easily be picked up along the way as\nsomething to be done off the side of the desk while engaged in more important or time-\nconsuming activities such as research. (Bates, 2000)\nAdditionally, many of the existing guidelines (Leung, Owens, Lamb, Smith, Shaw and\nHauff, 1999) lack practical examples for implementation and are themselves too technical\nto be easily followed and understood by academic courseware developers. Furthermore,\nthe guidelines tend to concentrate on the functional aspects of Web design and the needs of\nusers with sight or physical impairments, while there is a lack of attention to the needs of\npeople with cognitive or learning disabilities. The guidelines also fail to address learner-\ncentred design of online courseware. There is also a paucity of advice available specifically\naimed at the design and development of accessible educational courseware for academic\ndevelopers.\nA set of guidelines was required which are specifically tailored to learning and teaching in\nhigher education and to Web-based learning resources in particular. These guidelines\nneeded to incorporate details of potential barriers to access, practical examples for\nimplementation of accessible solutions and reference to the related W3C guidelines..\nThis paper presents a case study of best practice in the development of courses in WebCT\n(and also has generic application), taking account of the needs of people with a wide range\nof special needs. Rather then focus on particular categories of disability, the approach is to\nconsider the components and design issues concerned with the development of courseware\nin terms of the difficulties that students with disabilities might face in accessing them.\nAddressing those issues has provided a blueprint for online courseware development that\nrepresents not only a design strategy for people with special needs but is equally applicable\nto learner-centred courseware design in general.\nThe partners\nThis project is a collaboration between the Special Needs Computing Research Unit\n(SNCRU) of the University of Teesside and the Educational Development and\nTechnology Centre (EDTeC) of the University of New South Wales. It has been supported\nby a Study Abroad Fellowship from The Leverhulme Trust, UK. Members of the SNCRU\nhave carried out extensive research and development in the application of computer\ntechnology for people with physical and learning disabilities and the senior author of this\npaper provided the research expertise in this area. Current research interests within\nSNCRU include development of a symbols-based managed learning environment for\nstudents with severe disabilities; assessment, remediation and development of language in\nchildren with special educational needs; and investigation of Autistic Spectrum disorders.\nThe Educational Development and Technology Centre (http:llwww.edtecunsw.edu.au)\nprovides services in the promotion and development of institution-wide support for online\nlearning using WebCT. Part of EDTeC's remit is to investigate means of making education\nmore accessible, through technology, to people with disabilities. The centre's support\nenables teaching staff to develop online learning environments for themselves. As of\nMarch 2002 there were more than 600 courses online with more than 21,000 students\nenrolled on those courses.\n19\nElaine }. Pearson and Tony Koppi Inclusion and online opportunities: designing for accessibility\nSome definitions\nAccessible design in this context refers to the means by which the content and presentation\nof an online educational experience enables participation by every student regardless of\nthe browser, browser settings or assistive technology they may be using. The goal should be\nto enable, as far as possible, the same educational experience for everyone. One should\nrecognize, however, that it may be impossible to cater for all needs, all of the time, but care\nneeds to be taken to provide alternatives when particular needs cannot be met.\nAssistive technology can be defined as devices, tools, hardware or software that enable\npeople with disabilities to use the computer. Screen readers, screen magnifiers, alternative\nkeyboards or input devices, voice recognition software and text-only browsers are some of\nthe main examples of assistive technology.\nInclusion refers to the design of educational environments to take account of the needs of\nall learners, providing access to a learning experience at a pace and level to suit the learner.\nOnline learning presents opportunities for more inclusive education through the 'just in\ntime, just for me' approach - offering flexibility in the time, place, mode and pace of\nlearning (Collis and Moonan, 2001).\nEvaluation methodology\nAs part of its mission to encourage inclusive practices in educational development, EDTeC\naims to encourage staff developing courses in WebCT (designers) to attain, in the first\ninstance, compliance with Priority Level One of the W3C Web accessibility guidelines.\nPriority One means that the designer is satisfying the basic requirements for access to Web\ndocuments (W3C). This is in line with WebCTs own stated aim (WebCTand Accessibility,\nhttp:llwww. webct. com\/service\/).\nIn order to identify the accessibility problems related to the design of courses delivered\nthrough an online learning environment, and to propose solutions, an evaluation was\ncarried out of existing courses at UNSW, with the consent of the designers concerned. The\nprocess involved a combined qualitative and quantitative approach including:\n\u2022 extensive evaluation of WebCT courses developed at UNSW;\n\u2022 discussion with and survey of designers;\n\u2022 interviews with students with disabilities; and\n\u2022 practical evaluation by students of the accessibility of courses using assistive\ntechnologies.\nThe evaluation was based on the guidelines provided by W3C 'Web Content Accessibility\nGuidelines 1.0'; analysis of the courses using the Bobby Web site validation tool; testing\nwith other available checking mechanisms (for example, graphics turned off and monitor\nset to high contrast); and also with regard to courseware design methods.\nThe W3C guidelines are produced as part of the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative and\nprovide a guide to ensuring the accessibility of functional aspects of a Web site. There are\nfourteen guidelines or general principles, each with a set of checkpoints, and the rationale\n20\nALT-] Volume 10 Number 2\nbehind each guideline. Web Bobby is a tool which provides a crude but indicative analysis,\nallowing the designer to check the extent to which their courseware has met the criteria of\nthe W3C guidelines.\nHowever, evaluation of a learning environment which takes account of the requirements of\nthose with sensory and learning disabilities also requires analysis of the structure,\npresentation, content and navigational aspects. For this the principles of learner-centred\ncourseware design (Figure 1) were employed. A model of courseware design that combines\ncontent design, navigational design and visual design but is informed at all stages by the\nlearner model (Pearson and Green, 1999) is the one on which this evaluation is based.\nBriefly, the model incorporates content (design of learning materials and activities),\nnavigational design (flow of control and structure), visual modelling (user interface, icons,\ngraphics) and, crucially, learner modelling (who the learner is, what the learning needs are,\nhow the learner will learn, the aims and learning objectives).\nVisual\nDesign\n\/\nContent\nDesign\ni\n\\ r\nLearner\nModel\n\\\n\\\n\\\nNavigation\nDesign\nFigure I: A model ofleamer<entred courseware design (adapted from Pearson and Green, 1999)\nA set of evaluation criteria combining the W3C guidelines and aspects of learner-centred\ncourseware design was developed. The evaluation criteria were also informed by the results\nof interviews with a group of students. They were asked about the assistive technology they\nuse, their experiences in accessing the Web and WebCT for learning resources, the\ndifficulties they encountered and the benefits of online learning for them. The resulting set\nof seventeen checkpoints represents an instrument that is specifically aimed at evaluation\nof online learning environments as opposed to Web sites in general. Questions included:\n\u2022 Is the content including page organization, headings and lists consistent?\n\u2022 Are navigational elements consistent and well structured, do icons and pictorial images\nmake sense?\n\u2022 Is the content structured in usable chunks, avoiding excessive scrolling and are longer\ndocuments organized with links to sections and subsections?\n- \u2014\nElaine J. Pearson and Tony Koppi Inclusion and online opportunities: designing for accessibility\n\u2022 Are learning materials presented in an accessible format, and if not, are alternatives\nprovided?\n\u2022 Is the material accessible to assistive technologies (screen readers, speech recognition\nsoftware, text browsers, keyboard input, etc.)?\nCourse evaluation\nThirty WebCT courses were investigated. The evaluation was carried out to determine, in\nparticular, the level of accessibility for students with sensory or cognitive disabilities.\nAttention was paid to the structure, content, navigational design, communication facilities\nand compatibility of WebCT with assistive technologies such as screen readers, dictation\nsoftware and browser settings. The issues raised from an evaluation of the courses\ninvestigated and from the interviews of students with disabilities enable the results to be\npresented in two categories: generic and WebCT-specif\\c considerations.\nStudents' comments\nStudents' comments have been largely integrated into the results presented below, but some\nspecific examples have been selected here to illustrate some of the problems faced by\npeople with different disabilities in accessing courses.\nA student with dyslexia found the home page problematic on one course. He relies on the\nuse of visual cues in remembering structure:\nThe icons are too small, too complicated and the text links contain too many words. I\ndon't know what these icons mean (a wand for evaluation, man at work for\nassignments), they are not memorable and with the long text links I wouldn't remember\nwhere elements of the course belong. Also the background is too busy and interferes\nwith the information I'm trying to look at.\nA student with rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes (which can cause eyesight problems) had\nproblems with contrast, PDF documents and long scrolling documents:\nThe Welcome screen is orange\/yellow background, red text; the colour contrast makes it\ndifficult to read. The colours used in the Course outline document are also difficult\n(orange\/yellow with black text) - it blurs when I try to read it. Plain black text on white\nbackground is best. There are long scrolling text documents - 1 would find it confusing\nand tedious to scroll through all this text to find a particular piece of information. I want\nto be able to home in on a particular section without going through it all every time.\nA student with severe nystagmus and very low reading vision had problems with PDF\ndocuments and with the discussion and chat functions:\nThe online readings (PDF) are too small and the typeface is poor. It is too difficult to\nread. I would need dictation software to access the chat or discussion areas, but it\ndoesn't seem to work with the chat tool, so it would be useless to me.\nA totally blind student found navigating through the WebCT interface tedious, but his\nmain problem was with learning materials presented in an inaccessible format.\n22\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 2\nAs a law student, I find it particularly frustrating when many of the papers I need are in\nPDF format, also Powerpoint slides are no use to me online, nor other read-only formats. I\ncannot use online chat easily because the conversation moves on too quickly for me to read.\nEvaluation results - generic\nThe analysis of generic issues represents elements of courseware design which are a result\nof the methods, structure, design and presentation of materials by the designer that may\npose difficulties in accessing the learning environment for students with disabilities. These\ngeneric issues are not because of any constraints imposed by WebCT itself. The following\nwere the major problems encountered.\nInconsistent and inappropriate use of icons or graphics\nMany students with learning disabilities rely on pictorial cues for navigation or\nunderstanding learning objects.\nNo text equivalents for graphics, figures or other illustrations\nThis can be a problem for people with vision impairments who rely on screen readers to\ninterpret visual elements in a text format.\nPoor organization of content\nThere is a general design issue here in the tendency towards 'shovelware' - content\nintended for traditional delivery is merely uploaded for online delivery. The result is large\namounts of scrollable text which is difficult to manage and material which is not 'chunked'\nfor manageability. There is also a tendency not to take advantage of some of the features of\nWeb CT for organization of content.\nThe widespread use of PDF file formats for the presentation of text documents\nThis is a major problem. PDF files cannot always be interpreted by screen reading\nsoftware. For students with vision impairments for whom the traditional library is totally\nunusable, the presentation of documents online can be a huge benefit. The latest version of\nAdobe Acrobat Reader (http:\/\/www.adobe.com\/products\/acrobatlsolutionsacc.html) pro-\nvides an accessible solution, provided the document has been created in the first place in an\naccessible format. However, documents scanned and saved as graphic image files before\nconversion to PDF remain inaccessible. There are similar problems with other documents\nincluding PowerPoint presentations or movies created in Macromedia Flash.\nText may not be correctly or accurately interpreted by screen readers\nThis can present problems not just to vision-impaired students but also to those who have\ndifficulty in reading, interpreting or understanding text or complex language. Words in\ncapitals may be read as individual letters, abbreviations may not be recognized, and unusual\ncharacters are interpreted literally; for example, the symbol ~ when used as a line separator,\nwill be read as 'Tilda, tilda, tilda, tilda...' for as many times as the symbol appears.\nThe use of tables can be a problem for people with disabilities\nBecause screen reading software reads the information across cells, without appropriate\ntable header descriptions and careful use of layout, the contents of the table makes no\nsense to the learner.\nPoor interface design\nWhile designers may wish to customize their courses to reflect the individual academic and\n\u2014\nElaine J. Pearson and Tony Koppi Inclusion and online opportunities: designing for accessibility\ncourse, inappropriate use of foreground and background colours and contrast can make\nan interface hard to distinguish, read or interpret for people with visual, perceptual or\nspatial difficulties. Similarly the use of colour to convey important information and\ninconsistent use of icons can make access difficult for people with vision impairments or\nlearning disabilities.\nEvaluation results- WebCTspecific\nWhilst it is WebCT's stated aim to meet level one compliance with the W3C accessibility\nguidelines, some problems remain. The problems identified are not unique to this study\n{http:liwww.webct.com\/wywlViewContent7contentID-262793T) and the WebCT designers'\nonline discussion forum (http:\/\/www.webct.com\/webctlforum\/topics?discussion=7816&topic\n=21849) has been helpful in highlighting the efforts of others in this regard. In seeking to\nprovide designers with guidelines for inclusive design, it is important to distinguish\nbetween features that are subject to their own design decisions, and those factors that are\nattributable to the WebCT environment. The main problems encountered to date with\nfeatures of the WebCT environment are:\nThere is no text equivalent for some icons in the icon library; some titles and headings are\ngraphics without text equivalents\nThis is a problem for those using screen reading software. Also the headings cannot be\ndisabled, making it cumbersome for those using screen readers or with slow modem\nconnections.\nThe use of tables can be a problem\nJust as outlined above, tables need to be properly defined to ensure that screen readers can\ninterpret the information they contain.\nThe overuse of frames\nIn some instances, it has been reported that up to seven frames may be open on a screen at\none time. Once again, this can be confusing for those who rely on screen reading software.\nThe use of Applets and Java for the implementation of some of the interactive elements of\nWebCT, including chat windows, discussion groups, the whiteboard and email\nThis means that they cannot be accessed by students using dictation software, and presents\na barrier to those for whom text entry and other forms of communication are difficult.\nSynchronous chat is very difficult for people who have problems entering text or reading\nquickly enough. Students complain that the conversation has moved on before they have\nthe opportunity to respond.\nWe would hope that these issues will be resolved in future versions of WebCT. In any case,\nmany course designers will be using current and earlier versions for some time.\nStaff perceptions\nA short survey was carried out of staff at UNSW who are engaged in the development of\nonline courses to determine their views on and awareness of issues of accessibility to online\nlearning, and to confirm the results of informal discussions with six course developers. The\nquestionnaire was distributed as part of a larger survey via WebCT to a hundred course\ndesigners at UNSW, which generated twenty responses.\n24\nALT-] Volume 10 Number 2\nAcademics at UNSW build whole courses themselves, with support from EDTeC in\ninstructional design, the use of WebCT, and specialist graphics, audio and video services.\nDiscussions with staff reveal that for those who have developed their first course in\nWebCT, the main concern has been to get material online with limited instructional design\nsupport and restricted timescales. Some are not sure whether they have students with\ndisabilities on their course, and are often not aware of the techniques and design methods\nthat would make their courses inclusive. However, having successfully developed a course,\nthe academics are keen to incorporate inclusive design into the new courses they are\ndeveloping.\nThe survey results support the anecdotal evidence. A total of 15 per cent of respondents\ncould confirm that there were students with disabilities enrolled on their WebCT courses,\nwhile 45 per cent believed they had no students with disabilities and 30 per cent were not\nsure. There are a number of reasons why staff do not believe or are not sure if they have\nstudents with disabilities. It could be a lack of awareness of disability by academics;\nstudents may not be registered as having a disability - especially if they have a learning\ndifficulty; students may be reluctant to identify themselves as having a disability; or they\nmay not be aware themselves that they have a disability. This final point is particularly true\nof some students with specific learning difficulties (such as dyslexia). Students might\nidentify themselves to the Equity and Diversity Unit only if they believe they require\nparticular assistance.\nStaff were asked to indicate the type of disability their students have. This revealed that a\nrange of disabilities is encountered: learning\/physical disability, physical\/ sensory disability\nand sensory disability. When asked if they had been able to take account of learners with\ndisabilities in the design of their WebCT courses, 45 per cent believed that they had, 5 per\ncent said they had not, and 50 per cent did not know. However, 55 per cent of designers\nalso expressed an interest in receiving training in the design of inclusive courses.\nDiscussion and outcomes\nGuidelines\nIdeally, the needs of learners with disabilities should be addressed at the design stage rather\nthan attempting to retrofit solutions. While existing courses can be improved, through\ntraining, awareness and support, designers can create courses that meet the needs of most\nof their learners most of the time.\nA structured approach is required to help academics develop accessible courseware. At a\ngeneral level, staff should be encouraged to use the available features of the learning\nenvironment effectively. This would help in the structuring of the environment and in\nmaking the transition from traditional to online learning. Staff awareness needs to be\nraised of the available guidelines (such as W3C), checking facilities (Bobby), and software\ndevelopment support (such as Macromedia's accessibility extension for Dreamweaver Four\nand UltraDev for checking the validity of Web pages as they are created). Above all,\ndesigners also need support in developing learner-centred courseware (Harper and\nHedberg, 1997).\nThe findings of the investigation have been distilled into a set of guidelines (Pearson and\nKoppi, 2001) for academic designers of courses in WebCT, but which are generally\n25\nElaine J. Pearson andTony Koppi Inclusion and online opportunities: designing for accessibility\napplicable to all Web-based learning environments. The guidelines take the form of\ncheckpoints, with advice, hints, practical examples and techniques for implementation - a\n'how to' guide. The guidelines are available from http:\/\/www.edtecunsw.edu.au. This form\nof guidelines (which relate to those of W3C) is more useful to academic staff than the\ntechnical W3C guidelines which are not specifically aimed at the academic designer of\nonline learning environments. The checkpoints employed by these guidelines are\nsummarized as follows:\n\u2022 ensure consistent and appropriate use of graphics, icons and other visual cues;\n\u2022 ensure all graphics, figures, and other illustrations include a text equivalent;\n\u2022 organize content to take account of the transition to an online environment;\n\u2022 use the features provided by WebCT to organize and structure course content;\n\u2022 make PDF and other read-only file formats accessible;\n\u2022 be aware of the limitations of screen readers in interpreting unusual text, characters\nand abbreviations;\n\u2022 ensure that tables are carefully and appropriately used;\n\u2022 ensure appropriate use of colours and contrasts in screen design;\n\u2022 provide alternative sources of information for video or audio.\nEach checkpoint includes:\n\u2022 an explanation of its relevance to accessibility;\n\u2022 advice and practical examples illustrating how to implement the checkpoints using\nWebCT and Dreamweaver (the predominant Web authoring software available to\nacademics at UNSW and UoT);\n\u2022 referential links to further information where appropriate;\n\u2022 a reference for each checkpoint to the relevant W3C guideline(s).\nThe document includes a second section which advises the designer on methods of\nchecking their courses and resources for accessibility including using the available checking\ntools, simple manual checking methods and reference to EDTeC's 'Quality Teaching\nPrinciples and Guidelines' {http:llwww.edtecunsw.edu.au) for more advice on design issues.\nDissemination and future work\nThese guidelines were developed for staff at UNSW and others using the WebCT\nenvironment - but they have universal application. There is clearly a demand for similar\nmore generic guidelines across the academic community and there is scope for further\nrelated work. The University of Teesside is beginning to implement BlackBoard as the\nenvironment to support online learning. Since WebCT and BlackBoard are currently two of\nthe most popular commercially available online learning environments worldwide, the\nguidelines will be extended to include specific advice for users of BlackBoard as well as\nWebCT.\nWe intend to carry out a detailed evaluation of the guidelines and their effectiveness in\n26\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 2\nassisting the academic in inclusive course design and development. Other academics and\ninstitutions are encouraged to use the guidelines in the development of their own courses,\nand their feedback will be sought in developing and extending the guidelines.\nIn response to the results of the survey, which indicated a need for training in accessible\ndesign, we have developed a series of training workshops to give staff hands on experience\nof assistive technologies and practice in accessible design. Initially these workshops form\npart of the UNSW suite of training workshops. They will then be extended to the\nUniversity of Teesside as they develop their support program for BlackBoard, and\nsubsequently to other centres and universities.\nIn addition, we have developed an online course, based on the guidelines, in accessible\ncourse design which is being used in the professional staff development program at UNSW\nand also as a postgraduate module at UoT.\nConclusion\nAt the end of this stage of the project, we have been able to present an analysis of the\nproblems encountered by students with disabilities in the use of Web-based learning. As a\nresult of this analysis, a set of proposals for the design of online courseware that is\naccessible not just to those with disabilities, but to all students, has been developed. These\nproposals have been distilled into practical guidelines presented in a 'user-friendly' manner\nfor academics who simply want to get their courses online in the most efficient and\naccessible way. The next stage has been the development of workshops and an online\ncourse in accessible design which build on the guidelines and provide the opportunity for a\nbetter understanding of issues, techniques and tools in accessible design.\nThe key to accessible courseware is to take a learner-centred design approach, one which\ntakes account of the needs of the learner. Although one cannot expect always to meet all\nthe needs of every learner, reasonable steps can be taken to ensure the widest participation.\nEven if we are not meeting the needs of all potential users we should be aware of exactly\nwho we might be excluding. Designing for inclusion provides the opportunity to develop\naccessible courses for all students, and the move to online learning prompts us to improve\nour teaching and learning practices for all our students.\nAcknowledgements\nThis project has been supported by a Study Abroad Fellowship from the Leverhulme\nTrust, UK.\nReferences\nBates, A.
