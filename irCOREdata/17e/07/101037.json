INTRODUCTION\nPrecision measurements of the ft values for superallowed-\nFermi \u03b2 decays between isobaric analog states provide\nstringent tests of weak interaction theory and have been the\nsubject of much investigation for several decades (see [1]\nand references therein). These decays have confirmed the\nconserved vector current (CVC) hypothesis to better than\nthree parts in 104, set limits on the existence of scalar\nand right-hand currents, and currently provide the most\nprecise value for the up-down matrix element Vud of the\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark-mixing matrix\n[1,2]. This precise determination of Vud , together with a\nrecently updated value of Vus [3] provide the most demanding\ntest of CKM unitarity, a fundamental tenet of the electroweak\nstandard model. The present value of Vud obtained from the\nsuperallowed data is Vud = 0.97377(11)(15)(19) [4], where\nthe uncertainties result from (i) the experimental ft values\ncombined with transition-dependent radiative corrections, (ii)\na systematic discrepancy associated with two independent\ncalculations of isospin-symmetry-breaking corrections, and\n(iii) the transition-independent radiative correction. The un-\ncertainty in the latter correction has recently been significantly\nreduced [4], providing a reduction in the overall uncertainty\nof Vud by more than a factor of 2. As the uncertainty\nof the transition-independent radiative correction remains a\nconservative estimate, a further reduction may be possible\n*ggrinyer@physics.uoguelph.ca\n\u2020smithm@bubbletech.ca; Present address: Bubble Technology\nIndustries, P.O.

The\ncalculations of the \u03b4C corrections are obtained with either the\nmodel of Towner, Hardy, and Harvey [5,6] which use a shell-\nmodel diagonalization with a Woods-Saxon plus Coulomb\npotential or that of Ormand and Brown which employ a self-\nconsistent Hartree-Fock calculation [7]. These calculations\nreveal a small, but systematic, difference in the predicted\n\u03b4C values used in the determination of Vud , and the theoretical\nuncertainty associated with this difference outweighs the\nuncertainties in the experimental data and transition-dependent\nradiative corrections combined. Recent experimental effort has\nthus been focused on Tz = 0 superallowed emitters such as\n62Ga [8\u201311] and 74Rb [12\u201314] in the A\u0001 62 region where\nlarge \u03b4C corrections (>1%) are predicted, and on the Tz = \u22121\nsuperallowed decays in the 18\u0002A\u0002 42 region, where the\ndiscrepancy between the \u03b4C calculations is either enhanced or,\nas in several cases including 18Ne decay, the Woods-Saxon\ncalculations are anomalously large while the Hartree-Fock\ncalculations are not available.\nThe measurement of the ft values for the decays of\nTz = \u22121 nuclei presents a considerable experimental chal-\nlenge. These nuclei are further from stability than the well-\nknown Tz = 0 cases, have unstable daughters, and exhibit\nmultiple Gamow-Teller decay branches.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 025503 (2007)\nratio to the 0+ excited state at 1042-keV in the daughter\n18F is only 7.69 \u00b1 0.21% [15\u201317]. Despite the experimental\nchallenges, high-precision measurements of the decays of\nTz = \u22121 nuclei 22Mg [18,19] and 34Ar [20] have recently been\nachieved. In this work, we have determined the half-life of the\nTz = \u22121 nucleus 18Ne to a precision of 0.1% using a \u03b3 -ray\ncounting technique [21] that records the number of 1042-keV\n\u03b3 -ray photopeaks following the superallowed \u03b2-decay branch\nto the first excited 0+ state in 18F.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nA method of measuring precise \u03b2-decay half-lives by\ndetecting \u03b3 rays using the 8\u03c0 spectrometer [22\u201324], an array of\n20 Compton-suppressed HPGe detectors at TRIUMF\u2019s isotope\nseparator and accelerator (ISAC) radioactive ion-beam facility\n[25], has been developed and investigated in detail using the\n\u03b2\u2212 decay of 26Na [21,24,26] as a test case. The present work\nis the first to apply this technique to a superallowed-Fermi\n\u03b2 decay. Radioactive beams of 18Ne were produced in colli-\nsions of 500-MeV protons from the TRIUMF cyclotron, with\nintensities of up to 30 \u00b5A, on a SiC target. Samples of 18Ne\nwere extracted using ISAC\u2019s electron-cyclotron-resonance\n(ECR) ion source [27] operating in its first experimental run.\nFollowing mass separation, a beam of \u223c 4 \u00d7 10518Ne ions\/s\nwas delivered to the 8\u03c0 spectrometer for approximately 90 h.\nThe 30-keV beam was collected using a mylar-backed\naluminum tape, of thickness 40 \u00b5m, moving through the\nmutual center of the 8\u03c0 spectrometer and the Scintillating\nElectron-Positron Tagging Array (SCEPTAR), an array of 20\nthin plastic (delrin) scintillators. The SCEPTAR array [22,23]\nis arranged in four pentagonal rings providing a one-to-one\nmatch with the HPGe detectors of the 8\u03c0 spectrometer, and\nrecords the electrons and positrons that follow the \u03b2 decay\nwith approximately 80% efficiency. SCEPTAR, in conjunction\nwith the 8\u03c0 array, provides a powerful tool to perform\n\u03b2-\u03b3 coincidence spectroscopy [10,28] and its use as a\n\u03b2 counter for high-precision half-life studies is being investi-\ngated. In this work, SCEPTAR was used solely for determining\nthe levels of isobaric contaminants in the A = 18 beam of 18F\n(T1\/2 = 109.77(5) min [29]), in addition to the 18Ne daughter\nactivity, and molecular H17F (T1\/2 = 64.49(16) s [30]). Both\n17F and 18F \u03b2+ decay do not give rise to \u03b3 -ray radiation.\nSamples of 18Ne were implanted for 7 s (\u223c 4 half-lives) and\nthe subsequent decay was measured for 40 s before the tape\nwas moved and the cycle repeated. The \u03b3 -ray singles events\nwere recorded and time-stamped using a precision 10 MHz\noscillator during the entire implantation and decay cycle for\n15 runs, each lasting several hours. A window was set for\neach run that rejected any cycle in which the total number of\ncounts fell above or below the maximum and minimum values\nprescribed, thus eliminating from the analysis anomalous cy-\ncles such as those where the primary proton beam had tripped\noff. The 8\u03c0 data-acquisition system [21,22] provides a pile-up\nindicator as well as software-selectable Compton-suppression\nand variable (measured event by event) or fixed nonextendible\ndead-times per event. Compton-suppression is not utilized in\nhigh-precision half-life determinations with the 8\u03c0 due to the\npotential bias from rate-dependent false-vetos (see Ref. [21]).\nThe nonextendible dead-times, as well as the shaping times of\nthe amplifiers and the constant-fraction-discriminator (CFD)\nthresholds, were varied throughout the experiment in order\nto investigate possible systematic effects. Data were collected\nwith combinations of three dead-time settings (variable, fixed\n27 \u00b5s and fixed 40 \u00b5s), three HPGe spectroscopy amplifier\nshaping times (0.5 \u00b5s, 1.0 \u00b5s and 2.0 \u00b5s), and \u201clow\u201d and\n\u201chigh\u201d CFD thresholds.\nIII. HALF-LIFE OF 18Ne\nA. Results\nThe half-life of 18Ne was determined by selecting events\nin which the 1042-keV \u03b3 ray, which follows the super-\nallowed decay of 18Ne and connects the analog 0+ state\nto the 1+ ground state in the daughter 18F, was detected.\nSample \u03b3 -ray singles spectra obtained under different ex-\nperimental conditions are shown in Fig. 1.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 025503 (2007)\nand 2.0 \u00b5s shaping times, illustrating the improvement in\nenergy resolution.\nDecay curves associated with the 1042-keV \u03b3 ray were\ndead-time corrected on a cycle-by-cycle basis using the\nprocedure outlined in Refs. [21,31]. The nonextendible dead-\ntime values of variable (\u223c25 \u00b5s), fixed 27 \u00b5s, and fixed\n40 \u00b5s were determined on an event-by-event basis by the\nindividual event time-stamping information provided by a\nStanford Research Systems high-precision 10 MHz \u00b1 0.1 Hz\noscillator. The dead-time values deduced by this method\nhave been confirmed in previous studies via comparison with\nthe source-plus-pulser technique [32]. In this experiment,\nthe dead-time corrections were 10\u201340% at the start of the\ndecay curves for the variable (\u223c25 \u00b5s)-40 \u00b5s dead-time\nsettings, respectively. Following the dead-time corrections the\ncycle-by-cycle decay-curve data were summed and fit using a\nmaximum-likelihood \u03c72-minimization technique that has been\ndescribed in previous work [21,26,31]. A typical grow-in and\ndecay curve from a single run, and the corresponding fit to\nthe data is shown in Fig. 2 and includes corrections for\ndead-time and pulse pile-up effects using the method of\nRef. [21]. The half-life obtained for each of the 15 experimental\nruns are plotted in Fig. 3 where the weighted average of these\n15 values yield T1\/2 = 1.6656 \u00b1 0.0017(stat.) s and a reduced\n\u03c72 value of 0.55.\nB. Systematic uncertainties\nGrouping each of the runs according to their common\nelectronic setting (shown in Fig. 4) yields reduced \u03c72 values\nof 1.30, 0.04, and 0.05 when combined according to the\nthree shaping times, three dead-times, and two CFD threshold\nsettings, respectively. Following the method of the Particle\nData Group [3] we retain the largest \u03c72 value of 1.30 as an\nestimate for any unidentified systematic effects and inflate our\nstatistical error by the square root of this value. We therefore\nreport a systematic uncertainty of \u00b10.0009 s(syst.) so that\nwhen added in quadrature with the statistical uncertainty of\n\u00b10.0017 s yields the total uncertainty of \u00b10.0019 s.\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\nTime (s)\n10\n1\n10\n2\n10\n3\n10\n4\nC\nou\nnt\ns \nin\n 1\n04\n2 \nke\nV\n \u03b3-\nra\ny \nG\nat\ne\n1025 1030 1035 1040 1045 1050 1055\nE\u03b3 (keV)\n10\n3\n10\n4\n10\n5\nC\nou\nnt\ns\nT\n1\/2\n(\n18\nNe) = 1.6644 (47) s\n\u03c72\/\u03bd = 1.06\nFIG. 2.

This correction is small compared with the pile-up\ncorrections that have been successfully applied in our earlier\nstudies with the 8\u03c0 spectrometer, in which a 1.0% (equivalent\nto \u223c30\u03c3 ) pile-up correction in a \u00b10.05% measurement for\n26Na was confirmed through a comparison with traditional\n\u03b2 counting techniques [21]. From the 26Na analysis, a sys-\ntematic uncertainty in the application of the pile-up correction\nof 4% was assigned [21]. For 18Ne this amounts to \u00b10.05\u03c3\nor \u00b10.00009 s.

Contaminants\nWhile neither 18F nor 17F \u03b2 decay give rise to \u03b3 radi-\nation, bremsstrahlung from 18F or 17F \u03b2+ particles, inner\nbremsstrahlung from the electron capture process, and in-flight\nannihilation processes may produce a small time-dependent\nbackground beneath the 1042-keV gating transition. Because\nthe fractions of the total measured \u03b2 activity from SCEPTAR at\nthe start of the decay curve from 18F and 17F \u03b2 decay were only\n0.3% and 0.4%, respectively [33], it was expected that these\nprocesses would yield negligible contamination at 1042 keV\nin the \u03b3 -ray activity. In order to provide an estimate of these\ncontaminant levels we consider only the bremsstrahlung from\nthe \u03b2+ particles, the dominant process at 1042 keV. Based on\nthe QEC values of 1655 [29] and 2761 keV [30] for 18F and 17F\nrespectively, only the latter could give rise to contamination\nat 1042 keV. The ratio of the expected bremsstrahlung yields\nof 17F to 18Ne (QEC = 4446 keV [29]) \u03b2 particles in delrin\nat 1042 keV were calculated and led to a conservative upper\nlimit of 10% that of the observed total ratio of 0.4% that was\ndeduced from the \u03b2 activity with SCEPTAR. Combined with\na measurement of the observed bremsstrahlung yield of 18Ne,\nobtained from taking a \u03b3 -ray gate directly above the 1042-keV\nphotopeak, an upper limit for the 17F bremsstrahlung intensity\nin the 1042-keV \u03b3 -ray gate was deduced for each run. For the\ndata shown in Fig. 2 this upper limit is only \u0002 0.6 counts per\nsecond at the start of the decay. The data for each run were refit\nusing a function containing the exponential decays of 18Ne and\n17F plus a constant background with the 17F half-life fixed at\nT1\/2(17F) = 64.49 s, and the 17F intensity fixed at the deduced\nupper limit for each run. The half-life of 18Ne obtained via\nthis procedure, T1\/2 = 1.6656 \u00b1 0.0017(stat.) s, is identical to\nthat above where no contamination from 17F was considered.\nBremsstrahlung contamination from 17F \u03b2 decay is therefore\nnegligible. Inner bremsstrahlung and in-flight annihilation are\nexpected to contribute at even lower levels than the 0.04%\ndeduced from a calculation of the outer bremsstrahlung, how-\never, we have also considered this possibility by performing an\nadditional fit to the data that treated the 17F intensity as a free\nparameter. From this analysis the 18Ne half-life was unchanged\nand the 17F intensities deduced were consistent with zero, but\nwith large uncertainties, due to a large covariance between\nthe 17F intensity and the constant background rate. For 18F,\nouter bremsstrahlung is not possible at 1042 keV thus any\ncontamination could only come from annihilation in-flight or\ninner bremsstrahlung processes. The data were also fit using a\nfree 18F intensity (and included the grow-in from 18Ne decay)\nwhich also had no effect on the half-life of 18Ne presented\nhere.\nTo test for unknown rate-dependent systematic effects,\nthe data from the first three seconds (\u223c2 half-lives or\n75% of the data) after the beam was switched off were\neliminated from the data set channel-by-channel and re-fit\nusing the function described above that assumed a negligible\ncontribution from 17F. The results are plotted in Fig. 5\nwhere no evidence for a change in the half-life, and hence\nthe presence of rate-dependent systematic effects, were\ndetected.\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32\nNumber of leading channels removed (1 chan = 0.1 s)\n1.656\n1.658\n1.660\n1.662\n1.664\n1.666\n1.668\n1.670\n1.672\n1.674\n1.676\n18\nN\ne \nH\nal\nf-\nli\nfe\n (\ns)\nFIG. 5.

Diffusion and the half-life of 23Ne\nAnother potential systematic effect in the study of half-lives\nof implanted noble-gas isotopes using the techniques described\nhere is associated with their potential diffusion from the\nimplantation site that would systematically bias the deduced\nhalf-life to a smaller value. It has been observed [34] that\nfor noble-gas ions implanted into Al, approximately 10%\nof the implanted ions diffuse out with diffusion \u201chalf-lives\u201d\nof <100 ms. Short-lived diffusion effects for a portion of\nthe 18Ne atoms in this experiment have already been shown\nto be less than the statistical error in our experiment from\nFig. 5 where a systematic increase in the deduced 18Ne half-life\nas channels are removed from the start of the decay curve\nwas not observed. To test whether diffusion effects could\nbe present on longer time scales (>1 s), the half-life of the\nlonger-lived 23Ne was determined using the same experimental\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\nTime (s)\n10\n1\n10\n2\n10\n3\n10\n4\n10\n5\nC\nou\nnt\ns \nin\n 4\n40\n k\neV\n \u03b3-\nra\ny \nG\nat\ne T1\/2(\n23\nNe) = 37.11 (6) s\n\u03c72\/\u03bd = 0.88\nFIG. 6.

The A = 23 beam\nwas cycled with an 18.6 s implant and 400.0 s decay for\n20 cycles. The resulting grow-in and decay curve obtained\nfollowing a gate on the 440-keV \u03b3 ray in the 23Na daughter, is\npresented in Fig. 6. These data were fit using a two-exponential\nfunction with one of the exponentials having a fixed half-life\ncorresponding to that of 23Mg, T1\/2(23Mg) = 11.317(11) s\n[35,36], an isobaric contaminant in the beam. Following\ncorrections for dead-time and pile-up effects, the half-life of\n23Ne was determined to be T1\/2 = 37.11 \u00b1 0.06 s and was\nnot affected when we varied the 23Mg half-life between its\n\u00b11\u03c3 limits. This result is a factor of 2 more precise than, and\nconsistent with, a previous measurement of the 23Ne half-life\nthat obtained T1\/2 = 37.24 \u00b1 0.12 s [37] by trapping the noble\ngas ions in a stainless steel counting cell and was therefore\nfree of diffusion effects. When channels were systematically\nremoved from the beginning of the data set (as described above\nfor 18Ne), no evidence for a change in half-life was observed\nand we conclude that diffusion at these time scales can be\nconsidered negligible for implanted 23Ne, and therefore 18Ne,\nions.\nC. Comparison to previous results\nTreating the statistical, electronic systematic, and pile-up\nsystematic uncertainties as independent, we combine these in\nquadrature to obtain the half-life of 18Ne, T1\/2 = 1.6656 \u00b1\n0.0019 s. A comparison of the present work with the results\nof four previous measurements [17,38\u201340] is presented in\nFig. 7. Our measurement agrees with three of the four previous\nhalf-life determinations and is four times more precise than\nthe previously-accepted value T1\/2 = 1.672 \u00b1 0.008 s [15,29]\nthat was comprised of two measurements [17,40] that do\nnot agree within experimental uncertainty. The new world\naverage, obtained from averaging all measurements, is T1\/2 =\n1.6671 \u00b1 0.0017 s with a reduced \u03c72 value of 1.52 and is\noverlayed with the five experimental measurements in Fig. 7.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nWe have determined the half-life of the superallowed-Fermi\n\u03b2+ emitter 18Ne to be T1\/2 = 1.6656 \u00b1 0.0019 s, representing\nan improvement in precision by a factor of 4 over the\npreviously adopted world average. This result is the first high-\nprecision superallowed half-life measurement determined via\n\u03b3 -ray counting with the 8\u03c0 spectrometer at ISAC and includes\na 1.4\u03c3 correction from a newly developed technique to correct\nfor detector pulse pile-up effects.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank Keerthi Jayamanna and Mike\nMcDonald for their support during the ECR run.
