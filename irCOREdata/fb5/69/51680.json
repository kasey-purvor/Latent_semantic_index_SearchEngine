Qualitative data was collected from teachers and teaching \nassistants through the use of a focus group. The evidence suggested that \npractices within the school were varied and ranged from highly inclusive to \nhighly exclusive. Some teachers worked in good faith to develop effective \ninclusion for learners with special educational needs. Conversely, other \nteachers displayed negative attitudes towards these pupils and this impacted \nnegatively on the school\u2019s commitment to inclusion. Lack of funding, \nresources and training were identified as key barriers to inclusion. Parental \nresistance to inclusion was also evident within the context of this school and \nthere was a strong feeling that the inclusion agenda was problematic in the \ncontext of the standards agenda. Despite these issues there was a strong \nsense that practitioners should be willing to commit to the principles of \ninclusive education and the study considers some ways in which schools can \nadvance their practice in this aspect. Within this study the term \u2018practitioner\u2019 is \nused to represent  teachers and teaching assistants.  \n \nKey words: Inclusion, special educational needs  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nAlthough inclusion has dominated UK educational policy since 1997, the \nSalamanca Statement and Framework for Action on Special Educational \nNeeds (UNESCO, 1994) demonstrated an international commitment to the \nprinciple of inclusive education and more specifically, to the principle of \nregular schools for all learners.  According to Cole (2005), \u2018the last 20 years \nhave seen a significant policy move both nationally and internationally, \ntowards educational inclusion\u2019 (p.334). Changing values about children with \nspecial needs has influenced policy and practice and legislation now \nemphasises the rights of disabled people to full participation and equality of \nopportunity in every aspect of life.  \n \nDespite inclusion dominating the educational landscape, there is a lack of \nclarity regarding its translation in practice (Sikes et al, 2007). Some literature \nsuggests that inclusion is about the quality of learning and participation rather \nthan a common place of learning (DFES, 2004; Warnock, 2005). However \npractitioners have different interpretations of inclusion and this interpretation \naffects how inclusion is performed (Sikes et al, 2007).  \n \nA focus group was used to collect the data. The participants were either \nteachers or teaching assistants from one school in the north of England. The \ninterview schedule is presented in figure 1. The study complied with agreed \nethical conventions set by the British Educational Research Association.   \n \n \n Results \n \nClear themes emerged during the interview. These were identified as key \nbarriers to effective inclusion. \n \nAttitudinal barriers \n \nAttitudinal barriers were a recurring theme in the data. It is clear that inclusion \nwill remain a significant challenge if practitioners are not committed to its \nprinciples and it will be impossible if practitioners fail to embrace their \nresponsibilities for the education of all children. One practitioner identified \nways in which the standards agenda can shape negative practitioner attitudes \nin relation to inclusion:   \n \nI was at a meeting before the child started school and the teacher who \nwas going to be involved with John actually put up strong barriers \nbefore he arrived. She said she couldn\u2019t cope with him before he \nstarted at the school and that she had to focus on getting her class \nthrough the SATs. She was negative from the word go. She never gave \nhim a chance. John never actually really went into the classroom. He \nwent into a classroom by himself and barricaded himself in. He was \nisolated in his own room. The school failed him.  (Bev) \n \n \nIt is difficult to separate inclusion from personal values. Practitioner values \ninfluence the ways in which inclusion is implemented on the ground. Cole\u2019s \nresearch (Cole, 2005) provides insight into the views of mother-teachers who \nhad children with special educational needs. Her data illustrates that teachers, \nabove all, need to demonstrate that they are prepared to give inclusion a try \nand \u2018\u2026if there was \u2018good faith\u2019, then it was worth the effort\u2019 (p.341). Thus, \ngenuine inclusion demands a degree of risk-taking. Cole questions whether \n\u2018as a society shouldn\u2019t we be the ones willing to take more positive risks?\u2026to \nbe willing to commit ourselves to the challenge of inclusion; to commit \nourselves to \u2018good faith and effort\u2019 in the cause of equity and social justice\u2019 \n(2005: 342). Sadly, Bev illustrates that not all practitioners are prepared to \ntake this risk. In this example, the school claimed that by enrolling John, that \nthey were demonstrating their commitment to inclusion. In reality John was \ntaught in his own classroom with his own teachers. The practice was \nexclusive and resulted in John being categorised by his differences. The \nexample also illustrates that there is a lack of shared understanding of what \nconstitutes inclusion. This point is supported by Avramidis et al (2002) who \nargue that \u2018inclusion is a bewildering concept which can have a variety of \ninterpretations and applications\u2019 (p.158). Sally also supports this by \ncommenting that: \n \nWe all have our own ideas of what inclusion means. For some teachers \nit doesn\u2019t mean the child being involved in everything in the classroom. \nEverybody has their own individual idea of what it means and for some \npeople it simply means the child being in the building. (Sally) \n \n \nInclusion is difficult to do without support from the school\u2019s senior \nmanagement team. My data highlighted the frustration felt by a practitioner \nwhen the Head teacher accused her of neglecting her responsibilities to the \nrest of the class whilst she addressed the specific needs of one child:  \n \nI was dealing with Sam\u2019s behaviour one day. The Head came in and \nsaid\u2026I have never before been into a classroom where a teacher has \nbeen off task dealing with a child. Sam will have to go. This infuriated \nme.  I said\u2026where have you been? Do you really believe what you \nhave just said to me? In the past few years I have had several children \nwith behavioural issues- Lewis, Ethan and Charlotte. On occasions I \nhave been off-task for the first few months when these children have \ncome in as I have been supporting them. (Libby) \nLibby had recognised that Sam needed time before he could be genuinely \nincluded into the school. Thus, inclusion is a process rather than a change of \nstate. Libby had experience over several years of children with behavioural \nissues and she stressed that the first half term was often the most \nchallenging. During this time Libby focused on developing strategies to \nsupport children\u2019s specific needs. For Libby, it was crucial that senior staff \nunderstood that the process of inclusion for individual children takes time, \npatience and energy. Unfortunately this support from her line manager was \nnot evident and Sam was excluded on the grounds that he was having an \nadverse impact on the efficient education of the rest of his peers. Libby was \ndevastated that that the management team was not prepared to take the risk.  \n \nSally also voiced similar issues about the lack of genuine commitment to try to \nmake inclusion work:  \n \nFor a lot of teachers inclusion is not a priority. They have to focus on \ngetting results.  If it is too difficult they try to stop it. All you have to say \nis that a child is disruptive and that you can\u2019t handle him. They say that \nunless they have support they cannot cope. They do not try to make \nthings work by looking at what they do. They voice loudly to parents \nabout the effect the child is having on the others and then they have \nparental backing to get the child out. (Sally) \n \n \nTeaching style was a recurrent theme, which was identified as a key barrier to \ninclusion:  \n \nWe\u2019ve got a teacher who sees his job as just to teach and get them \nthrough the SATs. He expects every child to conform and that is \nagainst inclusion. You can\u2019t have a child coming in with behaviour \nproblems and the teacher not recognising these problems. It is the \ndifference between- if there is a problem in the classroom\u2026blaming the \nchild, or thinking\u2026what can I do to make this easier? Or what is wrong \nwith my environment if I am not meeting this child\u2019s needs. That is a \nmassive difference. Teaching styles have a lot to do with it. Inclusion is \nharder if you just want them all to sit there quietly. (Fran) \n \n \nIt will be interesting to see how his next teacher copes because he \nwon\u2019t continue what we have started. I don\u2019t think he will last very long. \nThe child will meet fire with fire. He will not tolerate his behaviour- he \nlikes them all to be quiet!   (Joan) \n \n \nThese comments illustrate that some practitioners are unwilling to change \ntheir approaches and apply systems flexibly in order to meet the needs of \nindividual children. Fran emphasises the need for teachers to reflect on their \npedagogical approaches rather than locating the source of the difficulty within \nthe child. In this respect, Fran has embraced a social model of disability rather \nthan a medical perspective, which takes a \u2018within-child\u2019 view of children\u2019s \ndifficulties. For practitioners to fully embrace inclusion, it is necessary to \nreflect on one\u2019s own practice and be willing to make changes to teaching \nstyles, systems and routines. This flexibility is central to the development of \ninclusive educational environments. Joan\u2019s comment serves to remind \npractitioners that the process of inclusion starts with them. Practitioners not \nonly need to commit themselves to the challenge of inclusion (Cole, 2005) but \nalso commit themselves to a process of reflecting on their own values and \nbeliefs.  \n \n \n \n \nOne-to-one support \n \nThe participant emphasised the need to balance the provision of individual \nsupport with children\u2019s social development. There was a strong feeling that \nsupport away from the classroom is detrimental to pupils\u2019 self-esteem and \nfosters a climate of dependency.  \n \nSome one-to-one sessions are appropriate. It\u2019s the idea of one-to-one \nin terms of one child; one adult and they stick together all day, every \nday. We see it happening in our school. This is hopeless because if a \nchild has someone next to them all the time you are setting them apart \nfrom all of the others. The child will become dependent. (Sally) \n \nFor children who already have low self-esteem, educating them out of \nthe class emphasises their difficulties both to themselves and others. \nThis will reduce self-esteem even further. Teaching assistants should \nsupport children inside the classroom so that they do not feel alienated. \nIf they are sent out of the room it makes them feel \u2018stupid\u2019 and \u2018thick\u2019. \nMost low ability children have low self-esteem anyway and things are \noften said by their peers which make them feel embarrassed, maybe \neven ashamed. Sending them out of class to work with a TA will \nexacerbate these feelings. I prefer to work inside a classroom where I \nam part of everything. (Mark) \n  \nIt is about everyone knowing the children, not just the support staff \nbeing palmed off with the low abilities and that\u2019s what it amounts to. We \nknow of support staff in our school who are writing review reports about \nthe children because the teacher does not know them. We are paid for \nthat responsibility. I heard a teacher say she was not paid to \u2018baby-sit\u2019 \nchildren who she felt were incapable of learning. She just sends them \nout of class with a member of support staff. Some teachers are not \ncapable of writing reports on children because they simply do not know \nthem. (Bev) \n \nThere is an argument for individual support for children outside \nclassrooms so that they are better able to access the curriculum when \nthey go back in. Short-term intervention programmes, for example in \nliteracy, are an example of this. However, if it is long term it can be \ndangerous. Aiden was a lovely little boy and used to come to me and \nchat. He also used to chat to the others. However, after he had worked \nwith Hilary outside of the classroom for a year I didn\u2019t recognise him. \nHe became shy and withdrawn and did not know how to mix or have a \nconversation. (Sally) \n \nI feel strongly about teachers sending the same group out with support \nstaff all the time. Every child should have access to a teacher. I\u2019ve \nseen it over and over again in our school. Some support staff educate \none group, the lower group usually. The teachers don\u2019t want to deal \nwith them. They send them out of class and leave the support staff to \nget on with it. (Sally) \n \nBev and Sally emphasise here the need for teachers to accept their \nresponsibility for the education of all children. The evidence presented here \nsuggests that teachers often abdicate this responsibility and consequently \ndemonstrate low expectations of learners with special educational needs.  \n \n \nTeam work \n \nAll participants stressed that effective inclusion depends on the availability of \nsupport in the classroom and the practitioners frequently referred to the \nimportance of classroom support for supporting children with behavioural \ndifficulties:  \n \n \nIt is a team thing. When I first had Lewis there would be times when I \nwould ask other team members to take over because I had had \nenough. If you work as a team you can do that. When you get to the \npoint when you know you won\u2019t deal with it appropriately you can hand \nover to someone else. If you are all aware of the strategies that work \nit\u2019s easy. Nobody in my room is any more important than anyone else. \n(Bev) \n \n \nWhether inclusion works depends on the level of support teachers \nhave in their classes, especially for pupils with behavioural difficulties. \nYou need at least two or three adults in the class- someone to deal \nwith the child with the problems, someone to hand over to when you \nget desperate and someone to teach the others. (Joan) \n \n \nStandards agenda  \n \nThere was a strong sense of feeling that the standards agenda prevented \npractitioners from effectively implementing inclusion. This emerged as the \nstrongest barrier to inclusion and teacher attitudes towards inclusion were \nalso linked to the standards agenda.  The two policy agendas were seen as \noppositional rather than complementary:  \n We know from our experience that it has affected our performance. \nOne year we had a lot of children with statements and it pulled down \nour results. The Head had to justify this to OFSTED. But we cannot \nsend back our raw material. It is not right to exclude on these grounds. \nThat is really true. We have to include everybody and inclusion is more \nimportant than test results. The current climate, where schools are \njudged on results, is the problem-not inclusion. If we believe in what we \nare doing and we believe it is right to include these children, we have to \nbe prepared to justify our results. (Bev) \n \nLast year the head stopped two members of staff from going through \nUpper Pay Scale 2 because they did not get high enough levels. They \nhave not been awarded a pay rise for the past three years and their \npupils have made progress. It\u2019s just that the progress isn\u2019t in line with \nnational expectations. (Mark) \n \nYou can raise standards if you ignore the rest and work with your \nborderline groups. These are the children who some teachers target. I \ndon\u2019t, I give them all time, but some teachers just teach the middle \nones and hold the others. You hear them talking about it in the staff \nroom. (Sally) \n \nThe voices illustrate ways in which the marketisation of schools impacts on \nthe inclusion agenda. The issues raised by Mark and Sally help to explain why \npractitioners may target some learners over others. In the current educational \nclimate schools and teachers are held to account for their results. The \ntemptation to focus on those learners who will make the biggest difference to \na school\u2019s results is understandable, however unjust this may appear. Those \nlearners with learning difficulties become problematic for schools. In terms of \noverall standards, these learners are likely to have a detrimental impact on \nschool performance data, especially in small schools. Thus \u2018educating \nchildren with special educational needs seems to present risks on many \nlevels\u2026\u2019 (Cole, 2005: 342).  \n \nThe current emphasis on raising attainment of children with special \neducational needs is also hugely problematic for learners themselves. Lloyd \n(2008) emphasises that current educational policy focuses on compensatory \nmeasures, which aim to enable all learners to achieve norm-related \nstandards. This system perpetuates a \u2018deficit view of children\u2019 (Lloyd, 2008: \n234) and fails to embrace diversity (Lloyd, 2008) by attempting to normalise \nall learners. This is echoed by Armstrong (2005) who argues that \u2018narrowly \nconceived performance criteria are central to the rhetoric of inclusion \nadvanced by New Labour\u2019s education policy\u2019 (p.147).  \n \nAccording to Giroux (2003) \u2018educators \u2026 should reject all forms of schooling \nthat marginalize students\u2026\u2019 (p.10). The current focus on narrowing the \nattainment gap between those learners with and without special educational \nneeds results in  \ncompensatory and deficit approaches geared towards the \nnormalisation and indeed standardization, of groups and individuals \nrather than contributing to the denormalization of the institutions, \nsystems and rules which comprise education and schooling.  \n      (Lloyd, 2008: 228) \n \nThe ways in which the notion of success is conceptualised is \u2018hostile to the \nnotion of full participation\u2019 (Lloyd, 2008: 229) and results in failure and \nmarginalisation of those learners with special educational needs who are \nunable to reach the standards. Current policy therefore constructs all learners \nas able and such a construction of the learner is hugely problematic for \nstudents with disabilities and or special educational needs who require the \nsupport of others (Goodley, 2007). The tensions between the inclusion \nagenda and the standards agenda create an uneasy relationship and \u2018in such \na relationship there will be winners and losers and it is suggested that the \nlosers will be the children who are deemed as having special educational \nneeds\u2019 (Cole, 2005: 334). Lloyd (2008) emphasises the need to \nreconceptualise achievement to make it \u2018attainable and accessible to all\u2019 \n(p.229).  \n \n \nLocation \n \nThere was no shared agreement amongst the participant about whether \nspecial schools posed a threat to the inclusion agenda:  \n \nSpecial schools have a purpose. No teacher wants to see a child \nmiserable or not joining in because they can\u2019t cope in mainstream \nschools. Sometimes we are doing them an injustice by keeping them in \nmainstream. It is better for them sometimes to go to a special school \nand learn important life skills such as cooking and sewing. (Sue) \n \nSue emphasises here that special schools have the potential to offer more \nmeaningful experiences for some learners with special needs and therefore \nshe does not associate inclusion with location. For Sue, effective inclusion \nrelated to the quality and relevance of the provision, not the location. Warnock \n(2005) also shares this view.  \n \nIt is not clear-cut. It boils down to the needs of the child as to whether a \nspecial or a mainstream school is most appropriate. However, we \nshould give them a chance in mainstream first. (Bev) \n \nThe idea of a unit with specialist staff working alongside mainstream \nstaff can work quite well. However I do not agree with segregated \nspecial schools. In a resource-base the pupils can be partially included \ninto the mainstream and inclusion can gradually increase if the child is \ncoping. The mainstream teachers also have access to specially trained \nstaff on-site. (Sally) \n Bev\u2019s point about giving children a chance in the mainstream is echoed by the \nmother-teachers in Cole\u2019s study (Cole, 2005). In this study the participants \nspoke of the need for teachers to demonstrate that they were trying and \ncommitted to inclusion through \u2018good faith and effort\u2019 (Cole, 2005: 341).  \n \nParental resistance \n \nMany of the participants spoke about parental resistance to inclusion. The \ninterview data revealed that parents were most resistant to the inclusion of \nchildren with social, emotional and behavioural difficulties in mainstream \nschools. Many of the participants were able to give examples of parents who \nhad questioned whether placements were appropriate and had expressed \nanxieties about the detrimental impact on their child\u2019s education. The data \nsuggests that parents start to resist inclusion when there is a cost to their own \nchild\u2019s efficient education:   \n \nSome children get tarred with a brush by the way other parents and \nsome children react to them. One parent has withdrawn her child as a \nresult of a boy in my class. She saw me three times about it before her \nchild joined the school about the child she was concerned about. She \ndidn\u2019t give him a chance. She blamed everything on him and always \npointed the finger at him. Eventually she took her child out of school \nbecause she said this child was always bullying her child. In actual fact \nit was both of them. At least now the child has a chance. The child who \nhas gone knew how to press his buttons. (Bev) \n \n \n \nTraining \n \nThere was strong feeling that many of the participants felt inadequately \ntrained to educate children with special educational needs:  \n \nOur training is appalling. In my training special educational needs was \nnon-existent. We are given these children and it\u2019s down to intuition how \nyou deal with them. I wasn\u2019t trained how to deal with children who are \nautistic or who have EBD. I wasn\u2019t trained how to deal with children \nwho have speech and language difficulties. You hope that outside \nagencies will be there to support you but very often they are not. Often \nthere is a lack of money and the support just isn\u2019t there. (Bev) \n \nIt\u2019s sink or swim a lot of the time. (Mark) \n \nHow many times did we ask to go on a handling course for Lewis? I \ndidn\u2019t want to get hurt and I didn\u2019t want to hurt him. He needed to be \nrestrained but no one would show me what to do. (Joan) \n \nTo keep other children safe you have to restrain them. But the authority \nwon\u2019t back you; they won\u2019t give you training in case the parents \nprosecute them. So they leave it to the teachers to take the risk. I want \nto say to the inclusionists\u2026tell me how to include a child who kicks, \nscreams and batters the others. Give me the training. But they won\u2019t. In \nan open-plan school if you don\u2019t restrain it will be chaos.  No one will \ntell you what to do because you could hold them to it. (Sally) \n \n \nResources \n \nLack of resources was identified as a barrier to effective inclusion:  \n \nWhen we had Susie we had to fight to get a guard to support her with \nswimming. She had cerebral palsy. Eventually we got one and he \nlowered her into the pool. She loved it. However, it took months and \nmonths to get to that stage. (Joyce) \n \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nGoodley emphasises that:  \n \nToo often, when we think of involving students in educational practices, \nwe assume students to be able, productive, skilled, accountable \nindividuals who are ready and willing to lead developments within the \nclassroom\u2026in short our students are \u2018able\u2019. Such a construction of the \nlearner is hugely problematic for students with disabilities and or \nspecial educational needs who require the support of others.  \n       (Goodley, 2007: 321) \n \nCurrent educational policy on inclusive education assumes uncritically that \neducators can narrow the gap between the attainment of learners with and \nwithout special educational needs. There is an assumption that the disabled \nlearner can transform themselves if the right conditions are provided \n(Goodley, 2007) and \u2018academic excellence is troubled by those who might \nnever be capable of (nor interested in) such achievements\u2019 (Goodley, 2007: \n322).  \n \nThe marketisation of education views learners with special needs as being in \nneed of remediation and correction in order to normalise them. The Code of \nPractice for Special Educational Needs (DFES, 2001) and its graduated \nresponse through the use of processes such as School Action and School \nAction Plus, and instruments such as individual education plans, views these \nlearners as \u2018eternally lacking\u2019 (Goodley, 2007). These \u2018compensatory and \ndeficit approaches\u2019 (Lloyd, 2008: 228) emphasise the need for learners to \nconform rather than celebrating their differences (Lloyd, 2008). Consequently \nlearners with special educational needs are categorised by their differences \nand ultimately failed by an education system that claims to be inclusive as the \nstandards, for many, are unattainable. For learners with special educational \nneeds their differences are made visible and the constant intervention, \nsupport and monitoring perpetuates the sense of failure.  \n \nParadoxically, rather than Removing Barriers to Achievement (DFES, 2004), \ncurrent educational policy erects the very barriers it claims to remove (Lloyd, \n2008). Despite the advances made in recent years by the social model of \ndisability, the education system for children with special educational needs is \nbased on a medical model. It adopts a \u2018within-child\u2019 view of the problem and \nconstructs difference and diversity as problematic. Armstrong (2005) has \nemphasised that:  \nInclusion is a normative concept \u2026 The policy of inclusion is aimed not \nat promoting equity\u2026but at establishing narrow cultural parameters of \nnormality to which all must have the opportunity to conform.  \n       (Armstrong, 2005: 147) \n \nThe Code of Practice (DFES, 2001) serves as a mechanism for regulation \nand the compensatory measures inherent within it constitute a rejection of \ndifference and diversity. Rather than celebrating these, the Code seeks to \nstamp them out. The graduated response ultimately categorises children by \ntheir impairments. After years of intervention, support and remediation, \nlearners with special educational needs are still constructed as failures \nbecause they are unable to reach the standards that have been uncritically \naccepted as the norm for all learners. The voices presented in my study \nillustrate how this assumption penalises not only children but also \npractitioners and schools.  All are failed, categorised and marked as a result \nof situating policies of inclusion within a standards agenda.  \n \nLloyd (2008) stresses the need to denormalise schools and the systems \nwithin them. She rightly emphasises the need to develop a broader notion of \nterms such as success and achievement to make them attainable for learners \nwith special educational needs. In this climate of marketisation, Goodley \n(2007) emphasises the need to resist over-coding and to reject labels as the \nbasis for defining the individual learner. Learners need to be viewed as \nproductive (in many ways) rather than lacking, and educators need to \nembrace creative pedagogies at the same time as rejecting pedagogies which \nseek to pathologise learners by their differences (Goodley, 2007). \n \nMy study has identified the need for practitioners to develop a shared \nunderstanding of what inclusive practice should look like. It has also identified \nthe need for practitioners to reflect on their own values in relation to the \neducation of children with special educational needs. The participants were \nable to identify practitioners who were resistant to take seriously their \nresponsibility for the education of children with special educational needs for a \nvariety of reasons. For example Joan and Fran emphasise that children with \nbehavioural issues presented a risk to the established order in the classroom.  \nBev talks about the reluctance of the school management team to enrol \nchildren with special educational needs due to the detrimental impact that it \nwould have on school performance indicators.  \n \nTeacher resistance to children with special educational needs is \nunderstandable.  Cole (2005) emphasises that inclusion presents as risk on \nmany levels. For teachers, children with behavioural issues may test their \nskills and patience and have a detrimental impact on the education of the \nmajority. Children with special educational needs can have an adverse effect \non school attainment data and individual teachers are held to account on the \nbasis of their scores. However, the labelling process results in fixed identities \nbeing imposed on learners with special educational needs and this clouds the \nway in which practitioners perceive children and it taints the ways in which \nlearners come to view themselves. This can have a detrimental impact on \nself-esteem and can perpetuate further failure. Behavioural issues and \neducational failure may be conceived in terms of a response to the imposed \nidentities which children with special educational needs have been forced to \nassimilate.  \n \nCurrent educational policy of narrowing the gap between learners with and \nwithout special educational needs will continue to marginalise those learners \nwho, for whatever reason, are incapable of reaching the same normative \nstandards as the majority. Goodley\u2019s work (Goodley, 2007) helps schools to \nembrace new pedagogies which enable practitioners to view learners as \n\u2018becoming-learners\u2019 (p.328) and reject normalisation through the use of \nremedial compensatory approaches.  Current policy erects barriers to \nparticipation and achievement for learners with special educational needs and \npractitioners are held to account if the barriers are insurmountable.  \n \nHowever, it is not sufficient for schools and practitioners to embrace new \npedagogies in the absence of a change in educational policy. The current \nsystem of judging all children by the same normative standards is outdated. \nAccording to Slee (2001) \u2018schooling has always produced exclusion\u2019 (p.113). \nThe time is now ripe for change and educational policy needs to reject the \nprinciples of modernity upon which it is currently based.  \n \nThe assessment system needs to be modified to recognise pupils\u2019 individual \nstrengths in a range of areas, rather than the current preoccupation with \nstandards in literacy and numeracy.  Lloyd (2008) encourages us to think \nabout a new system, which enables different learners to participate in different \ngames, rather than all learners joining in the same game. The voices \npresented in my study suggest that there are many barriers to inclusion in this \nmainstream school and I suspect that many teachers in schools across the \ncountry are voicing similar concerns. The problems arise fundamentally \nbecause we are trying to force all learners to reach the same standards and \nsubject them to the same pedagogical processes. This often manifests itself in \nresistance, often in the form of behavioural issues.  \n \nThis obsession with one size fits all results negative practitioner attitudes. \nPractitioners feel threatened by these learners, not because they have \nnegative views on disability, but because these learners threaten their \nperformance data and consequently their identity as good educators. \nAdditionally, parents may resist inclusion because of the risk it poses to the \nacademic performance of their own child. Practitioners feel that they need \nmore training to manage children\u2019s behaviour and to support them in \nnarrowing the gaps between the attainment of learners with and without \nspecial educational needs.  \n Practitioners need to have the courage to experiment with new pedagogies. \nThe need to celebrate difference and diversity is paramount, rather than trying \nto normalise it. Educators need to reject the imposition of labels, which \ncategorise and impose fixed identities upon individuals. Children need to be \nallowed to demonstrate their own unique strengths and genuine personalised \nlearning is the way to equity. Achievement and attainment needs to be re-\nconceptualised so that different achievements are recognised, valued and \ncelebrated. Change at practice level need to be accompanied by a change in \npolicy. The current was in which personalised learning has been conceived \nbears little resemblance to genuine child-centred education. Current policy \nsituates personalised learning within the standards agenda, which \ninstrumentally acts as a barrier to participation and achievement. Finally, \npolicy makers should devise new games for different learners to play rather \nthan expecting all learners to join in and submit to the rules of one game. \nPerhaps then, the barriers to inclusion, which have been identified in this \npaper, will be dismantled.  \n \n \nConclusion \nThis paper has explored the barriers to inclusion voiced by practitioners in one \nprimary school. Several barriers were evident but the standards agenda \nemerged as the key barrier to pupils\u2019 participation and achievement. Policy \nchange is necessary to break down these barriers and practitioners on the \nground need to be empowered to embrace alternative pedagogies. Further \nresearch is needed into the nature of alternative pedagogies so those \npractitioners can start to re-shape their own practice. However, in the \npredicted absence of such policy change, practitioners will, understandably, \nlack the courage to action real genuine change.  \n \n \nReferences \n \nArmstrong, D., (2005), \u2018Reinventing \u2018inclusion\u2019: New Labour and the cultural \npolitics of special education\u2019, Oxford Review of Education, 31, (1), 135-151.  \n \nAvramidis, E., Bayliss, P. and Burden, R.
