Introduction\n[2] Recent studies have identified two dominant means by\nwhich ocean mesoscale features (such as fronts and eddies)\naffect the surface stress. Firstly, the surface stress and its curl\nfield, and hence the Ekman pumping, are modified not just by\nwinds, but also by the presence of ocean currents. Ocean\ncurrents give rise to a relative motion between atmosphere\nand ocean, and hence modify the surface stress [Bye, 1986].\nIn this paper we treat this simply as a change in relative\nvelocity of the interface, and we do not consider more\ncomplex modulation of the stress due to wave-current inter-\naction [Johannessen et al., 1996].\n[3] Secondly, surface stress is modified by the SST gra-\ndients associated with ocean features, as a result of a\ncombination of the change in wind speed, and the change\nin stability as airflows across different SST regimes [as\nreviewed by Xie, 2004; Chelton et al., 2004; Small et al.,\n2008]. A common feature of these studies is that the low level\nwind speeds and hence the magnitude of the stress above ocean\nmesoscale features tend to be larger overwarmSSTandweaker\nover cool SST. Changes in the surface stress due to these mecha-\nnisms can also be accompanied by changes in the gradients of\nthe stress, which are important to upper ocean circulation.\n[4] The aim of this paper is to investigate the relative\neffect of the ocean surface current and atmospheric boundary\nlayer adjustment on the stress fields over Tropical Instability\nWaves (TIWs) in the eastern Pacific, and to deduce the impact\nthis has on the ocean eddies. TIWs are important to the heat\nbudget of the Equatorial Cold Tongue [Jochum et al., 2004;\nJochum and Murtugudde, 2006; Menkes et al., 2006;\nDutrieux et al., 2008] as well as being associated with\nsignificant biological activity [Yoder et al., 1994; Menkes\net al., 2002]. They are also believed to rectify onto interan-\nnual SST and precipitation variability [Jochum et al., 2007;\nZhang and Busalacchi, 2008].\n[5] Note that as the atmospheric response to TIWs has\nalready been well studied and quantified, as reviewed in\nsection 2.2, this allows the current effect to be better distin-\nguished, and the feedback to be better understood. We use a\nregional coupledmodel and satellite measurements of surface\nstress, SST, and surface height to perform the investigation.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In section 2, a background\nis given on the twomechanisms of stress adjustment. Section 3\ndescribes the data, the model and the methods. Section 4\nquantifies the reduction in eddy kinetic energy (EKE) and the\nchange of decay rates of the TIWs when surface currents act\non the stress fields. Section 5 then explains in more detail\nhow the damping takes place via Ekman pumping, and\ndistinguishes this from the effects of the changes in surface\nstability and near-surface winds. This is followed by a\nDiscussion of how the feedback mechanisms affect the heat\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 114, C04009, doi:10.1029\/2008JC005147, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1International Pacific Research Center, University of Hawaii, Honolulu,\nHawaii, USA.\n2Naval Research Laboratory, Stennis Space Center, Mississippi, USA.\n3Department of Oceanography, School of Ocean and Earth Science and\nTechnology, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.\n4Department of Meteorology, School of Ocean and Earth Science and\nTechnology, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.\n5Frontier Research for Global Change, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth\nScience and Technology, Yokohama, Japan.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/09\/2008JC005147$09.00\nC04009 1 of 17\nbudget of the eastern Equatorial Pacific Ocean, and we finish\nwith Conclusions. The major finding of the study is that the\nimpact of surface stress modulations due to surface currents\non ocean eddies is significant both in observations and\nmodel: this has been known for the mean current field, but\npreviously has been shown only theoretically for eddies\n[Dewar and Flierl, 1987].\n2. Background\n2.1. Stress Modification by Surface Ocean Currents:\nThe \u2018\u2018Understress\u2019\u2019\n[6] Bye [1986] studied the impact of surface currents on the\nstress by the change in the relative motion and termed it\n\u2018\u2018understress\u2019\u2019: this termwill be used in this paper henceforth.\nHe noted that the air-sea interface exerts a drag on both the\natmosphere (via wind stress) and the ocean (via understress).\nBye [1986] derived the total surface stress in bulk flux\nform as\nt \u00bc ta \u0002 to\nta \u00bc CU 10 to \u00bc CUC ; \u00f01a\u00de\nwhere\nC \u00bc ra\n1\u00fe e\u00f0 \u00de2 CD U 10 \u0002 UCj j: \u00f01b\u00de\nHere U10 is the 10 m wind vector, UC the surface ocean\ncurrent, CD is the 10 m drag coefficient, and ra is air density.\ne2 is the ratio of the product of density and drag coefficient\nin air to that in seawater. In most applications the ratio is\nassumed negligible so that\nt \u00bc raCD U10 \u0002 UCj j U10 \u0002 UC\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc raCD Usj jUs; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere Us = U10\u0002U c is the relative surface motion. The fact\nthat the ocean current does appear in the surface stress\nhas been noted by several investigators using satellite\nscatterometer measurements [Kelly et al., 2001; Cornillon\nand Park, 2001; Chelton et al., 2004; Park et al., 2006].\n[7] Various analytical and numerical models have been\nused to study the impact of the \u2018\u2018understress\u2019\u2019 on the equa-\ntorial ocean currents and the cold tongue [e.g., Pacanowski,\n1987; Luo et al., 2005]. Less attention has paid to the effect\non mesoscale eddies, with the exception of the studies\ndiscussed next.\n[8] The impact of understress on ocean eddies can be\nunderstood by considering the Ekman pumping wE, given by\nwE \u00bc 1r0\nrx t\nf\n; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere f is the Coriolis acceleration, t is the surface stress\nvector defined above, and r0 is an average water density.\nDewar and Flierl [1987] considered the effect of the full\nformulation of stress on ocean eddies (including surface\nocean current Uc in equation (2)) in a quasigeostrophic\nframework on an f plane (f = f0). Linearizing (U10\u0002Uc) about\nthe atmospheric wind, when the background wind is zonal,\nthe additional Ekman pumping due to the understress effect\nis approximately given by\nw0E ffi\nra\nr0\nCDU10\n2ucy \u0002 vcx\n\u0001 \u0002\nf0\n; \u00f04a\u00de\nwhere Uc = (uc, vc) and subscripts x and y denote differen-\ntiation. For an axisymmetric vortex, with vcx = \u0002ucy, the\nrelative vorticity x = \u00022ucy, so that expression (4a) can be\nrewritten\nw0E ffi\nra\nr0\nCDU10\n3x\n2f0\n: \u00f04b\u00de\n[9] This extra term results in a relaxation of the thermo-\ncline and is analogous to bottom friction: it is referred to by\nDewar and Flierl as \u2018\u2018top drag.\u2019\u2019 Numerical experiments\nshowed that the dissipation of the eddy due to this top drag\nwas over three times more effective than from a more stan-\ndard biharmonic interior friction.\n[10] Martin and Richards [2001] investigated the impact\nof this effect on an anticyclonic eddy in the North Atlantic,\nand estimated Ekman pumping anomalies up to 1 mday\u00021.\nThis made a significant contribution to the vertical flux of\nnutrients, an argument supported by in situmeasurements by\nMcGillicuddy et al. [2007]. It is worth remarking that\nwhereas cyclonic and anticyclonic mode 1 eddies are damped\nby the top-drag effect, the near surface vertical motion in the\nmode-water (mode 2 \u2018\u2018lens\u2019\u2019) eddies by McGillicuddy et al.\n[2007] are enhanced. This is because the latter has upward\nmotion at the top of the pycnocline, whereas the geostrophic\ncurrents are determined by the depression at the bottom of the\nthermocline. The top drag causes upward motion to enhance\nthe doming of the upper pycnocline and to transport nutrients\nvertically.\n[11] Seo et al. [2007] showed that the perturbation surface\ncurrents of TIWs can alter the surface stress estimate over\nthe TIW region by \u00b120%. Polito et al. [2001] computed\nthe Ekman pumping associated with TIWs and displayed\na Ho\u00a8vmoller diagram of the properties averaged between\n1.5\u0001N and 3.5\u0001N. By comparing the SSH anomaly and the\nEkman pumping, and finding them in phase, they deduced\nthat the Ekman pumping was due to the surface currents of\nTIWs impacting on the surface stress. As suggested by\nDewar and Flierl [1987], the TIW \u2018\u2018vortex\u2019\u2019 is feeling a drag\nat the sea surface.\n2.2. Stress Modification by Ocean Eddies due\nto Atmospheric Boundary Layer Adjustment to SST\n[12] Several investigators have found modification of low\nlevel winds and surface stress over Tropical InstabilityWaves\n(TIWs) [Hayes et al., 1989; Xie et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2000;\nHashizume et al., 2001; Chelton et al., 2001]. In addition to\nthe already noted increase of stress over warmer water,\nChelton et al. [2001] described the consequences of this for\nthe stress gradient fields. Positive wind stress curl tends to be\ngenerated when the wind blows along the SST isotherms of\nthe northern TIW front, due to the shear between the higher\nspeeds to the right and lower speeds to the left of the air\nparcel. They find an observed linear relationship between\nwind stress curl and the crosswind component of SST\nC04009 SMALL ET AL.: EDDY DAMPING DUE TO AIR-SEA COUPLING\n2 of 17\nC04009\ngradient. In addition, the wind stress divergence is found to\nbe linearly related to the alongwind component of SST\ngradient, as winds are often found to diverge as they cross\nSST fronts. Chelton et al. [2004] and O\u2019Neill et al. [2005]\nextended this work to find similar relationships in most of the\neddy-rich regions of theWorld\u2019s oceans. Following Seo et al.\n[2007] we will refer to this mechanism of stress modulation\nas the SST-wind feedback.\n[13] A few studies have looked at the effect of these\nmodifications of stress on the underlying ocean, in particular\nvia the Ekman pumping. The consequent modification of sea\nsurface height (SSH) by Ekman pumping is seen in the linear\nvorticity equation under long wave approximation: [e.g.,\nWhite and Annis, 2003]. The relevant terms here are\n@h\n@t\n\u0002 cR @h\n@x\n\u00bc \u0002 r\n0\nr0\nwE \u00fe . . . ; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere r0 is the potential density difference between the upper\nocean and the interior ocean, and r0 is an average water\ndensity. Hence positive (negative) Ekman pumping velocity\nacts to decrease (increase) the SSHA.White and Annis [2003]\nfound that this would affect the translational motion of a\nwarm anticyclonic eddy in the northern hemisphere. Under\nbackground westerly winds, the positive (negative) curl\nfound north (south) of the eddy acted to reduce (increase) the\nSSH anomaly (SSHA) via the Ekman pumping, thus leading\nto an equatorward motion.\n[14] The coupled modeling study by Seo et al. [2007]\nshowed that the atmospheric wind response to SSTanomalies\nin TIWs is negatively correlated with the surface currents.\nThis indicated that TIWs are damped by the overlying\natmospheric wind response. In an analysis of the eddy kinetic\nenergy (EKE) equation, they estimated this effect to be\nroughly 10% of the barotropic conversion source term in\nthe tropical Atlantic Ocean.\n[15] Spall [2007] investigated the effect of SST induced\nwind stress curl anomalies on baroclinic ocean eddies using\nan oceanic quasigeostrophic model with the Ekman pumping\ndetermined to be a function of the SST gradient. For the case\nof wind blowing from warm to cold water, he found that the\ngrowth rate of the instabilities could be enhanced relative to\nthe Eady problem for uncoupled flow. Spall [2007] also\nfound that strong stratification, weaker oceanic jets (less\nadvection), and low latitudes favor stronger coupling. Thus\nit may be expected that the process would be important for\nTropical Instability Waves near the equator. Here the airflow\nis from cold to warm in which case the expectation is that\nthere will be a damping effect. Indeed, in an earlier study\nPezzi et al. [2004], who used a similar parameterization of\nwind stress anomalies, note a decrease in SST variability in\nTIWs when the coupling was switched on.\n[16] In the present study we extend the results by Polito\net al. [2001],Chelton et al. [2001], Pezzi et al. [2004] and Seo\net al. [2007] to distinguish and quantify the SST-wind\ncoupling mechanism and the understress mechanism and\ntheir effects on TIWs.\n3. Data and Methods\n[17] In this paper satellite observations will be used to\ndiagnose the combined effects of SST-wind feedback and\nunderstress on the TIWs. However, these data cannot easily\nbe used to distinguish between these feedback mechanisms,\nand therefore we also employ a regional ocean-atmosphere\nmodel to perform sensitivity studies.\n3.1. Satellite Data\n[18] To study the observed relationship between surface\nstress, SST, and surface currents we utilize three comple-\nmentary satellite data sets. SST was gathered from the\nTropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave\nImager (TMI). TMI data is not affected by clouds and hence\nhas a significant advantage over infrared radiometers in\nregions of large cloud cover [Wentz et al., 2000]. For near-\nsurface wind and stress estimates, we use the QuikSCAT\nSeaWinds scatterometer. QuikSCAT normalized cross-\nsection is calibrated against 10 m neutral wind vectors\ndeduced from buoy measurements (as discussed for NSCAT\nby Wentz and Smith [1999]). In order to convert to surface\nstress we use the Large and Pond [1981] formalism. For both\nSST and winds we use the daily 3-day running mean product\nfrom Remote Sensing Systems (www.ssmi.com), processed\non a 0.25\u0001 grid. Sea level data is gathered in the form of\ncombined TOPEX\/POSEIDON and European Remote Sens-\ning satellite sea level anomaly fromCentre National d\u2019Etudes\nSpatiales (CNES) Archiving, Validation and Interpretation\nof Satellite Oceanographic data (AVISO [Ducet et al.,\n2000]), from October 1992, on a 0.25\u0001 grid, every 10 days.\nThe anomaly is defined relative to a 7-year time mean for\n1993\u20131999.\n3.2. Regional Coupled Model\n[19] The IPRC Regional Ocean Atmosphere Model\n(IROAM) is run for the eastern Pacific domain [Xie et al.,\n2007]. It comprises a regional atmospheric model [Wang,\n2001; Wang et al., 2004] and the MOM2 ocean model\n[Pacanowski and Griffies, 2000]. The sigma coordinate\natmospheric model has 28 sigma levels, 8 of which are in\nthe lower 1000 km to better resolve the boundary layer. The\nz coordinate ocean model has 30 levels, 20 of which are in\nthe upper 400 m. Vertical mixing in the ocean is based on\nthe Pacanowski and Philander [1981] scheme, and lateral\nmixing is governed by a constant Laplacian eddy viscosity\ncoefficient of 200 m2 s\u00021.\n[20] A 1=2\u0001, co-located grid is employed for the ocean\nT, S and tracer points and the atmospheric unstaggered\ngrid. Xie et al. [2007, their Figure 1] show the domain\nof the complete model system. The fully coupled ocean\u0002\natmosphere part of the model covers the Pacific Ocean from\n150\u0001Weastward to the American coastline, and from 30\u0001S to\n30\u0001N. In this interactive domain, the coupling occurs once\nper day, and fluxes are derived from the Fairall et al. [2003]\nbulk formulae using daily mean values of the SST (and\nsurface currents for the understress case) from the ocean\nmodel and near\u0002surface temperature and humidity from the\natmospheric model. The ocean model is initialized by setting\nthe temperature and salinity equal to Levitus [1982] January\nclimatology and velocity set to zero. It is spun up from 1991\nto 1996 using basin wide forcing from NCEP\/NCAR reanal-\nysis [Kalnay et al., 1996], then the interactive coupling is\nswitched on from 1996 to 2003. Further details and an\noverview of the model performance can be found in the work\nof Xie et al. [2007]. Lateral boundary conditions and initial\nC04009 SMALL ET AL.: EDDY DAMPING DUE TO AIR-SEA COUPLING\n3 of 17\nC04009\nconditions of the atmospheric model are obtained from the\nNCEP\/NCAR reanalysis.\n[21] The coupled model is modified to include the under-\nstress effect in a similar fashion to that described by Song\net al. [2006]. First the relative surface motion Us = U10\u0002U c\nis found using the uppermost layer ocean current and the\nlowest layer atmospheric velocity. This is used in the calcu-\nlation of the bulk surface fluxes (see equation (2)). These bulk\nfluxes (stress, heat flux) are then used as boundary forcing for\nthe ocean model. For the atmospheric model, the lowest layer\nmomentum equation includes the effect of the ocean current\nin the vertical diffusion [Song et al., 2006, their equations (6)\nand (7)]. This approach is equivalent to the fully coupled run\nby Luo et al. [2005].\n3.3. Methods and Model Experiments\n[22] In order to highlight the effect of the TIWs, we high\npass filter the data longitudinally, by removing a 12\u0001 running\naverage, and then linearly regress onto a variable at a fixed\npoint where the variance is high (e.g., filtered SST at 2\u0001N,\n120\u0001W), following Hashizume et al. [2001]. This technique\neffectively highlights the effect of TIWs on the atmosphere\nand the stress fields. The linear regressions presented here are\ndone using daily data in order to derive smooth, well-sampled\nfields. For the satellite altimetry, the 10 day gridded SSHA\ndata was linearly interpolated in time to a daily resolution.\nAlthough the altimetry data significantly undersamples the\nTIWs (which have periods of 17\u201330 days), the results are still\nuseful when used in conjunction with well-resolved model\ndata which was compiled into daily averages. Further, the\nlinear regression uses a long time series of data where many\nmeasurements are taken of the different phases of TIWs (i.e.\nfrom a number of different TIW vortices); in that sense, it\nprovides a reasonably well-sampled data set.\n[23] For consistency between observations and model, we\nuse 10 m neutral equivalent wind U10N instead of 10 m wind\nU10. Here a modification of equation (2) needs to be con-\nsidered. In the absence of currents\nt \u00bc rCDN U10N\n\u0003\u0003 \u0003\u0003 U10N\u0001 \u0002;\nwhere CDN =CDjU10j2\/jU10Nj2 is the neutral drag coefficient.\nCDN is independent of stability and is a function only of the\n10 m neutral wind speed for a motionless surface. When\ncurrents are considered, the drag coefficient becomes a\nfunction of the change in speed between the surface and 10m.\nHowever, as the Large and Pond drag coefficient is constant\n(1.2 \n 10\u00023) for wind speed changes within the range 4 to\n11 m s\u00021 (including most of the range of winds considered in\nthis study, see section 3.1), we will assume also that the small\n(<1m s\u00021) adjustments to the windmade by assuming neutral\nstratification and\/or by adding ocean currents do not change\nthe drag coefficient.\n[24] Three main model simulations are presented to inves-\ntigate the sensitivity of the model system to the feedbacks\nof interest. A control run contains full coupling, including\nthe understress effect, and is referred to as Experiment 1\n(Exp. 1). A second simulation was performed identical to\nthe control except that the understress effect was switched\noff (Exp. 2). In addition, an atmosphere-only run was\nperformed for comparison with coupled simulations, termed\nExp. 3, which uses TMI daily SST (a 3-day running\naverage), as a surface boundary condition. The latter run\nhas the advantage of having observed SST at the surface,\nallowing a direct evaluation of the SST-wind feedback\neffect against observations.\n4. Dynamic Variability of the Tropical Instability\nWaves\n[25] An overall comparison of the regional coupled model\nand observations is presented in Xie et al. [2007]. Here we\nconcentrate on the TIW activity and begin by comparing the\nEKE and the SSH variability in the coupledmodel runs and in\nobservations.\n4.1. Eddy Kinetic Energy and Sea Surface Height\nVariability\n[26] The level of TIW activity can be characterized by a\nsuitably defined eddy kinetic energy (EKE). We write the\nocean velocity u \u00bc U \u00fe u0, where U is taken to be the\nvelocity field associated with the large scale flow field and\nu0 an eddy component. For this analysis we use the spatial\nhigh pass filter described in section 3.3 to define the eddy\ncomponent [Hashizume et al., 2001]. (When using this\nspatial filter, the time mean of @u0\/@t is not necessarily\nzero, but in practice it is near zero.) The EKE is given\nby 1\/2r0(u\n02 + v02), and is computed from one year of data,\n1 May 2000 to 30 April 2001, which includes one full TIW\n\u2018\u2018season\u2019\u2019. A depth average of the EKE is then performed to a\ndepth of 95 m, which is close to the depth of the core of the\nEUC in the eastern Pacific.\n[27] The EKE in the model case with understress (Exp. 1,\nFigure 1a) reaches a maximum in the longitude range 135\u0001W\nto 120\u0001Wand between the equator and 2\u0001N. When averaged\nin longitude between 140\u0001W to 110\u0001W (Figure 2), the peak\nvalue for Exp. 1 is nearly 66 J m\u00023, close to the equator.\nWhen the understress is removed (Exp. 2, Figures 1b and 2),\nthe EKE is increased, to around 100 J m\u00023, about 11=2 times\nthe Exp.1 value.\n[28] As this stage it would be useful to compare with\nobservations, but estimates of EKE from observations are\nmostly confined to close to the Equator [e.g., Qiao and\nWeisburg, 1998] where the TAO ADCP are located, or along\na particular longitudinal section (e.g., Luther and Johnson\n[1990] computed an EKEwhich peaked at 2\u0001N at around 75 J\nm\u00023 at 70 m depth and averaged over 3 longitudes between\n150\u0001W and 160\u0001W, estimated from their Figures 5 and 9).\nHowever, individual velocity component covariances were\ncomputed by Baturin and Niiler [1997] from a large (nearly\n2000 member) sample of Lagrangian drifters in the tropical\nPacific Ocean. They found that at 15 m depth, the meridional\neddy velocity covariance r0(v\n02) reached a maximum of\napproximately 75 J m\u00023 close to the equator and at 120\u0001W,\nand over 125 J m\u00023 at around 3\u0001N (derived from their Plate\n4c). These values are comparable to those of total EKE found\nin the model, but a more quantitative comparison is not\nundertaken due to the different time periods and\/or longi-\ntudes used in the Luther and Johnson [1990] and Baturin and\nNiiler [1997] study.\n[29] A better quantitative comparison can be made by\nanalyzing the sea surface height anomaly measured from\nsatellite directly and that from the model data. (This has the\nadded advantage that the data can be filtered in the same way\nC04009 SMALL ET AL.: EDDY DAMPING DUE TO AIR-SEA COUPLING\n4 of 17\nC04009\nas the model to highlight the TIWs.) For this analysis, the\nSSH data is filtered spatially as before to highlight the TIWs,\nand for the model data the time mean is removed (this has\nalready been done in the altimetry product), to derive SSHA.\nThe root mean square (RMS) of SSHA was computed from\n3 years of data (1998\u20132000). The observed SSHA is greatest\naround 6\u0001N and between 140\u0001W and 130\u0001W in these years,\nwith maximum amplitude between 6 and 7 cm (Figure 3a). In\nExp. 1, the maximumRMS of SSHA is weaker than observed\n(less than 5 cm), and located further east and slightly south of\nthe observed maximum (Figure 3b). When the understress is\nremoved (Exp. 2), the maximum RMS of SSHA is actually\ncloser to that observed (Figure 3c).\n[30] Two important points arise from Figures 1 to 3. Firstly,\nthe eddy activity is significantly reduced when understress is\nincluded. This may arise due to the direct damping of the\neddy field by the \u2018\u2018top drag\u2019\u2019 effect [Dewar and Flierl, 1987;\nPolito et al., 2001], or indirectly by reducing themean current\nshear [Pacanowski, 1987] and hence the level of instability\nand energy conversions which leads to eddy activity. This is\ndiscussed further below. Secondly, it is noteworthy that the\nobserved SSH variability appears to be comparable to or\nlarger than the model run with no understress, and signifi-\ncantly greater than the case with understress. This point is\ninteresting in itself, but the comparison with observations\nshould not be used to say whether Exp. 1 or Exp. 2 is more\n\u2018\u2018skillful\u2019\u2019 than the other, because of the strong sensitivities of\nthe model to other, more tunable parameters, in particular the\nhorizontal, constant Laplacian eddy viscosity, and the vertical\neddy viscosity, which are less physically based than the\nunderstress effect. Instead, it suggests that the amount of\nmomentum mixing in the model may be too low, because of\ndeficiencies of the mixing scheme.\n4.2. Eddy Kinetic Energy Budget\n[31] A common method of analyzing the generation and\ndissipation of TIWs is to compute the eddy kinetic energy\n(EKE) budget [e.g., Luther and Johnson, 1990;Masina et al.,\nFigure 1. EKE (Jm\u00023), depth averaged from the surface to 95m. (a) Experiment 1 and (b) Experiment 2.\nC04009 SMALL ET AL.: EDDY DAMPING DUE TO AIR-SEA COUPLING\n5 of 17\nC04009\n1999]. The EKE budget shows the relative importance of\ndifferent mechanisms of energy transfer (e.g., via baroclinic\nor barotropic instabilities or diffusion). Previous studies have\nsuggested that TIWs generate from barotropic instability\noccurring on the meridional shear between the northern\nbranch of the South Equatorial Current (SECN) and the\nNorth Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC [Philander, 1978]),\nor on the meridional shear between the Equatorial Undercur-\nrent (EUC) and SECN [Luther and Johnson, 1990; Qiao and\nWeisburg, 1998; Masina et al., 1999], or from baroclinic\ninstability [Cox, 1980; Luther and Johnson, 1990]. The latter\nis at least partly due to the presence of the northern SST front\n[McCreary and Yu, 1992; Masina et al., 1999]. The debate\nover which mechanism is most important is complicated by\nthe proposed existence of two distinct types of waves, one\nnear the equator and one further north possibly associated\nwith the SST front [see Cox, 1980; Luther and Johnson,\n1990; McCreary and Yu, 1992; Kennan and Flament, 2000;\nLyman et al., 2007, for more details].\n[32] It is not the purpose here to add to these discussions\nof the generation mechanisms for TIWs, but it is important\nto compute the generation terms of the EKE equation in order\nto better understand the counteracting role of understress.\nHowever, the EKE budget is sometimes difficult to interpret\nas it represents a balanced state after the various mechanisms\nhave all played their part. In order to detect the tendency that\nwould occur due to a particular mechanism alone, we also\npropose below a simple modification of the EKE terms.\n[33] The standard EKE terms for the ocean model have\nbeen stated by, e.g., Luther and Johnson [1990] and Masina\net al. [1999], while Baturin and Niiler [1997] and Seo et al.\n[2007] also include the term which involves work done by\nsurface stress on the eddies. Of interest here are the conver-\nsion terms, and the stress work term, which may be written in\ndepth-averaged form as\nBT \u00bc \u0002r0 u0 \u000b u0 \u000b\n@U\n@x\n; u0 \u000b\n@U\n@y\n\u0004 \u0005\u0006 \u0007\n:\nBC \u00bc \u0002g r0w0h i\nS \u00bc uc\n0 \u000b t0\n\u0001 \u0002\nh\n; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere BC is the baroclinic conversion, BT is the barotropic\nconversion and S is the stress-feedback damping term due to\nthe interaction of the part of the stress modified by the TIWs\nwith the TIW surface current field, the term of interest here.\nHere the angled brackets denote a depth average to depth h, uc\nis the ocean surface velocity, u0 and U are the depth depen-\ndent ocean eddy and large scale current respectively, and t is\nthe surface stress.\n[34] The reason why the stress-work term provides a\ndamping is illustrated in Figure 4, taken from Experiment 1\nwith full coupling and understress. The filtered SST (color),\nsurface stress (black arrows) and surface current (white\narrows) are all regressed onto filtered SST at 2\u0001N, 120\u0001W.\nAs noted by Seo et al. [2007], the surface stress anomalies\noppose the current anomalies over much, but not all, of the\ndomain shown. This is due to both the understress mecha-\nnism and the SST-feedback mechanism. For instance, over a\ncold cusp (e.g., at 123\u0001W, 3\u0001N and vicinity) the currents\ncoincide in direction with the background south-easterly\nwinds, and hence the stress is less than in a case with no\nsurface current. This adds to the SST-wind feedback effect,\nFigure 2. EKE (J m\u00023, equivalently kg m\u00021 s\u00022), depth averaged to 95 m then averaged between\nlongitudes 140\u0001\u2013110\u0001W.

For Figures 3b and 3c, the\nmean SSH (cm) is added as contours.\nC04009 SMALL ET AL.: EDDY DAMPING DUE TO AIR-SEA COUPLING\n7 of 17\nC04009\nwhich also leads to reduced stress in the cold cusps, due to the\natmospheric boundary layer adjustments (the process dis-\ncussed by Seo et al. [2007]). Consequently there is a negative\ncorrelation between the stress anomaly and the current\nvelocity. The stress damping is often largest in the cold cusps\nof TIWs (as seen from a longitude-time Hovmo\u00a8ller plot,\nFigure 4b).\n[35] The terms in the EKE budget are evaluated first using\na value of h = 95 m, as in the EKE calculations of section 4.1\n(sensitivity to depth average is discussed below). The results\nfor the 1 year time average, averaged in longitude between\n140\u0001W and 110\u0001W, for Exp. 1 and Exp. 2, are shown in\nFigure 5. For the case with understress (Figure 5a), the\nbarotropic conversion term (thick solid line) has a large\nFigure 4.

All frommodel Experiment 1.\nC04009 SMALL ET AL.: EDDY DAMPING DUE TO AIR-SEA COUPLING\n8 of 17\nC04009\nmagnitude near the equator (due to meridional shear between\nthe EUC and SECN), while the baroclinic conversion term\n(thick dashes) is significant between the equator and 5\u0001N,\npeaking at around 3\u0001N (partly due to the near surface temper-\nature front, and partly due to deeper vertical shear of the\nequatorial currents), while the stress-damping term (thin solid)\nalso has its largest values centered on 3\u0001N, but is rather small\ncompared with the conversion terms. These values are similar\nin spatial distribution and relative magnitude to those found by\nMasina et al. [1999] for the Pacific Ocean and Jochum et al.\n[2004] and Seo et al. [2007] in the Atlantic Ocean. (Note that\nthe three terms shown do not form a closed balance: other\nimportant terms include the vertical dissipation of energy in\nthe mixed layer; (M. Jochum, personal communication,\n2007) and the radiation term (advection of the pressure\nanomalies by the eddy currents [Masina et al., 1999]).\n[36] When the understress is removed (Exp. 2), a large\nsecondary maximum of the barotropic conversion term\noccurs near 4\u0001N, (the shear zone between the SECN and\nNECC), while the peak in baroclinic conversion is slightly\nchanged in location but not in amplitude (Figure 5b). Mean-\nwhile, the stress-damping term (as represented by term S)\ndoes not change much between runs (compare thin solid line\nin Figures 5a, and 5b).\n[37] At first glance these results suggest that in the 1-year\nbalance, the difference in EKE between Exp. 1 and Exp. 2 is\ndue to the change in mean current shear at 4\u0001N, (which would\ninfluence the barotropic conversion term), while the under-\nstress has little impact. However, there is another possibility,\nwhich cannot be detected in this balanced result. If the\nunderstress has a significant damping effect on the eddy\namplitude, it would have two effects on the EKE balance.\nFigure 5. Eddy kinetic energy budget terms, depth average, and longitude average (140\u0001\u2013110\u0001W).\nBarotropic conversion is marked with a thick solid line, baroclinic conversion with a thick dash, stress-\ncurrent feedback with thin solid (units of 10\u00025 kg m s\u00023, equivalent to 10\u00025 J m\u00023 s\u00021).

(c) As in Figure 5b, but depth-averaged to 45 m.\n(d) As in Figure 5b, but using the mean shear from Experiment 2 (no understress) and the eddy part from\nExperiment 1 (understress) to compute the barotropic term.\nC04009 SMALL ET AL.: EDDY DAMPING DUE TO AIR-SEA COUPLING\n9 of 17\nC04009\nFirstly it would act to reduce the stress-damping term S, and\nsecondly it would affect the barotropic conversion term BT,\nbecause these terms are dependent not just on the stress and\nthe mean shear respectively, but also on the eddy part (u0, v0)\nof the flow (see equation (6)). Thus it is difficult to assess the\ntrue importance of the understress from the balanced state.\n[38] An alternative approach is to consider the tendency in\nEKE if the understress effect is suddenly switched on. Here\nwe can take the results from Exp. 2 (where the eddies have\nnot been affected by understress) and compute the correlation\nof the eddy currents with the stress tm that would have been\ncalculated were the surface current taken into account, using\ntm \u00bc\ntW U10 \u0002 UCj j U10 \u0002 UC\u00f0 \u00de\nU10j jU10\n; \u00f07\u00de\nwhere tWis the original surface (wind forced) stress in Exp. 2.\nWe have assumed the change of the drag coefficient is small\nwhen the relative motion is added (see section 3.3). Thus this\napproach is an approximate method to gauge the true impact\nof understress, and it may be noted that it does not include any\nof the consequences of the modification on the size of the\nother terms or on the eddy amplitude, which are included in\nthe full model of Exp. 1.\n[39] The direct effect of switching on the ocean current\ninfluence via equation (7) can be viewed from scatterplots of\nthe filtered stress versus filtered wind or current values\n(Figure 6). For the no-understress Exp. 2, the stress anomalies\ntW\n0 are related to the meridional wind anomalies (Figure 6a),\nas expected from equations (1) and (2), but show no clear\nrelation to surface current (Figure 6b). These unmodified\nstress anomalies have a magnitude mostly less than 0.02 N\nm\u00022. However, the modified stress values tm\n0 do show\nan approximately linear relationship with surface current\n(Figure 6c). When the difference is taken between the\nmodified and the unmodified stress, tm\n0\u0002tW0 (Figure 6d),\ndifferences of up to 0.01 N m\u00022 occur when the surface\ncurrent anomaly is strong (magnitude of 0.5 m s\u00021 or more).\nIn other words, the effect of the eddy surface current on stress\ncan be up to half the total filtered stress value.\n[40] When the modified stress (equation (7)) is used, the\nnew stress-damping term is given by\nSm \u00bc\nuc\n0 \u000b t0m\n\b \t\nh\n; \u00f08\u00de\nwhich provides a measure of the magnitude of the damping\neffect on the eddies before the eddies are reduced in amplitude.\nFigure 6.

Units\nof stress are N m\u00022; wind and currents are in m s\u00021.\nC04009 SMALL ET AL.: EDDY DAMPING DUE TO AIR-SEA COUPLING\n10 of 17\nC04009\nThe resulting modified stress\u0002damping term (Sm) for Exp. 2\nis shown on Figure 5b (thin dashed line). It is significantly\nlarger than the unmodified term and is comparable in mag-\nnitude to the baroclinic and barotropic conversion terms\nbetween 1\u0001 and 6\u0001N.\n[41] It should be noted here that the importance of the\nmodified stress-damping term is not particularly sensitive to\nthe choice of depth of averaging. For example, when con-\nsidering an upper ocean budget to 45 m for Experiment 2\n(Figure 5c), the BT and S terms become larger in absolute\nmagnitude than for the 95 m case (Figure 5b), while the\nmodified stress-damping term Sm becomes second only in\nmagnitude to that of BT near the equator. For a deeper\naverage to 172 m (well below the core of the strong equato-\nrial zonal jets in this longitude range and in this model), the\nSm term is still almost half as much as the BT value near\nthe equator and comparable to the other terms at 4\u0001N (not\nshown).\n[42] The implication of these new results is that the\nintroduction of understress leads to a significant reduction\nin EKE and to a new balance of terms in the EKE equation. It\nis thus an important effect in the dissipation of TIW EKE, as\nwill also be shown later from analysis of the Ekman pumping\nvelocity.\n[43] From Figures 2 and 5, an estimate of the e-folding\ntimescale implied by the stress term can be derived. Table 1\nlists the estimates for near the equator (where the EKE is\nhighest) and at 3\u0001N (where the stress damping is high),\nfor experiment 2. The e-folding times at the equator are\n100 days and 50 days using the unmodified and the modified\nstress term respectively. At 3\u0001N the corresponding decay\ntimes are just 30 days and 12 days respectively. Considering\nthat the period of TIWs is just 15\u201330 days, these decay times\nwould imply a significant reduction in eddy activity and\nreadjustment of the flow if the understress effect were to\nbe turned on, and is consistent with the reduced EKE\nfound in Exp 1.\n[44] The question remains as to whether the difference in\nthe barotropic conversion term between the experiments at\n4\u0001N (Figures 5a and 5b, thick solid lines) is due to reduced\nmean shear, or reduced eddy activity, or both. To answer\nthis we start by viewing the long term time-mean of @U\/@y\n(Figure 7, for experiments 1 and 2) which has been identified\nas the important component of the barotropic conversion\nterm by Jochum et al. [2004]. At the surface there is little\ndifference between the two experiments (maximum absolute\nshear at the surface of 4.16 \n 10\u00026s\u00021 for Exp. 2, 4.06 \n\n10\u00026s\u00021 for Exp. 1), while in the thermocline Exp. 1 has\nslightly larger values (by about 10%). It appears to be\ncounterintuitive to have larger shear in the case of under-\nstress, which generally reduces equatorial currents in coarse\nglobal models [Pacanowski, 1987], but it may be caused\neither by the reduction of the extraction of energy from the\nmean by eddies or a nonuniform change of the zonal mean\ncurrents. These small differences suggest that the BT term is\nmainly being modified by eddy current component.\n[45] To verify the fact that mean shear was not causing the\ndifference in BT term at 4\u0001N, BTwas recomputed for Exp. 2\nbut taking the mean shear from Exp. 1, and the results (not\nshown) were essentially unchanged from the full Exp. 2\nterm seen in Figure 5b. Alternatively, when BT is computed\nusing the mean shear from Exp 2 (no understress), and the\neddy part from Exp. 1 (understress), the result is almost\nidentical to that for Exp. 1 alone, as can be seen by\ncomparing Figures 5d and 5a. These results show that the\ndifferences in the BT term between Exp. 1 and Exp. 2 is\nmostly due to the change in eddy amplitude. A physical\nexplanation for these results is that the barotropic conver-\nsion in the SECN\/NECC shear zone is heavily dependent on\nthe strength of the eddies that are available to extract energy,\nmore so than in the EUC\/SECN shear zone where the mean\nshear appears to determine the conversion term [Weisburg\nand Weingartner, 1988].\n[46] In the next two sections we look in detail at the inter-\naction between the ocean and atmosphere on the scale of the\nTIWs and consider the reason for the decreased EKE when\nunderstress is introduced.\n5. Modulation of Surface Stress and Ekman\nPumping Fields\n[47] As discussed in sections 1 and 2, the surface stress curl\nfields and hence the Ekman pumping may be modified by\nocean eddies either by the effect of SST gradients on the\noverlying wind, or from the understress effect. One technique\nto examine the relative effects of each process is to regress the\nfiltered stress curl fields onto indices of the TIW activity, for\neach of the 3 experiments described above. Note that in this\nsection we refer to high pass filtered and regressed fields as\nanomalies.\n5.1. Surface Stress Curl\n[48] If we choose the high-pass SSTat a particular location\nalong the propagation path of the TIWs as the TIW index\n(section 3.3), some interesting features are seen in the field\nof regressed wind stress curl (Figure 8). The observations\nshow large curl anomalies in two distinct latitude ranges: one\nmostly within 2\u0001 of the equator, and one centered on 4\u0001\u20135\u0001N\n(Figure 8a). The near-equatorial anomalies are reproduced in\nall 3 experiments (but with somewhat larger amplitudes in\nExp. 3, the atmosphere only simulation, Figure 8d). Here the\ncurl response is governed by the SST-wind feedback (indeed\nfurther examination showed that they were linearly depen-\ndent on the cross-wind SST gradient, as discussed byChelton\net al. [2001]). The higher latitude anomalies (4\u0001\u20135\u0001N) are\nTable 1.

These differences between the\nsensitivity runs are not seen in fields of the regressed sur-\nface stress divergence (not shown), which is governed by the\nSST-wind feedback in all cases [Chelton et al., 2001; Small\net al., 2003].\n[49] The importance of the understress to the surface stress\ncurl is more clearly seen when the fields are regressed onto an\nindex of the TIW dynamic variability, namely the high-pass\nSSH at a particular location along the propagation path of\nthe TIWs. Figures 9a and 9b show the filtered stress curl\nregressed onto the filtered SSH at 4.5\u0001N, 120\u0001W. Note that\nthis location is in a region of high SSH variance in both the\nobservations and model (Figure 3, also Kennan and Flament\n[2000] observed the center of TIW vortices to be at a similar\nlatitude). For Exp.1, with understress, there is a nearly\nin-phase relationship between the anomalous stress curl and\nthe anomalies of ocean SSH (Figure 9a), especially in the\nlatitude range 3\u0001\u20136\u0001N. In contrast, for the run with no\nunderstress (Exp. 2), the relationship between anomalous\ncurl and SSH is weaker, such that it is approximately in\nquadrature (Figure 9b). In this case, there is a small but\nnonzero anomalous curl signal because the curl has a small\ndependence on SST at this latitude, and the SST anomaly is\nspatially related to the SSH anomaly (via advection of the\nmean SST gradient by the currents, which are dependent on\nthe gradients of the SSH).\n[50] If the surface currents are really dominating the\nfiltered and regressed stress curl in Exp. 1, then we may also\nexpect that the filtered relative surface motion Us\n0 will be\ndominated by the surface current, (i.e. Us\n0 = (U10\n0\u0002U c0) \u000e\n\u0002Uc0), so that its curl will be equal to minus the filtered\nsurface ocean vorticity (as discussed by Chelton et al.\n[2004]). Here primes denote filtered values. The regional\nmodel outputs the relative motion Us and the surface ocean\ncurrents in Experiment 1. The curl of the relative motionr\n\nU s\n0 in Exp. 1 is shown in Figure 9c (color) and indeed it can\nbe seen that it is close in magnitude and opposite in phase to\nthe filtered ocean surface vorticity (Figure 9c, contours). In\ncontrast, the curl of the purely atmospheric quantityr\nU100\nin Exp. 2 shows no relationship with the ocean vorticity\n(Figure 9d), confirming our hypothesis that the ocean cur-\nrents are primarily responsible for the curl signatures in\nFigure 9c.\n5.2. Ekman Pumping\n[51] Having identified that the understress is mainly con-\ntributing to the anomalous stress curl fields for latitudes 3\u0001 to\n7\u0001N, we next need to examine how that impacts the ocean.\nHere the Ekman pumping is computed from the nonfiltered\nsurface stress and then filtered and regressed onto the high\npass SSH at 4.5\u0001N, 120\u0001W (Figure 10). The Ekman pumping\nis not applicable near the equator and only the latitude range\n2.5\u0001 to 7\u0001N is shown.\n[52] For the observations (Figure 10a), Ekman pumping\nanomalies are located slightly south of, and are of the same\nsign as, the SSHA anomalies. (The reason for the relative\nsouthward location of the Ekman pumping extrema may be\nappearance of the Coriolis acceleration in the denominator of\nequation (3)). The Ekman pumping anomalies reach a mag-\nnitude of 10\u00026 m s\u00021 cm\u00021, which for a typical SSH anomaly\nof 5 cm is equivalent to \u000e0.5 mday\u00021.\nFigure 9.

(d) As in Figure 9c,\nbut for Experiment 2.\nC04009 SMALL ET AL.: EDDY DAMPING DUE TO AIR-SEA COUPLING\n13 of 17\nC04009\n[53] According to equation (5) positive (negative) Ekman\npumping velocity acts to decrease (increase) the SSHA.\nThe relationships between SSHA and wE in the TIWs\n(Figure 10a) indicate that over the SSHA centers the Ekman\npumping would act to reduce the SSHA anomaly.We can note\na similar relationship in the regional coupled model, Exp. 1\n(Figure 10b).\n[54] The Ekman pumping derived directly from the surface\nstress of the model can be compared with that estimated by\nequation (4b), which assumes a uniform wind and axisym-\nmetric vortex. Using the regressed vorticity values shown in\nFigure 9c (contours), and a typical mean wind of 7 m s\u00021, the\nestimated Ekman pumping using equation (4b) is shown in\nFigure 10c (contours). It can be seen that the estimate\ncompares well with the full Ekman pumping derived from\nthe model stress (Figure 10c, color). This strongly supports\nthe hypothesis that the anomalous Ekman pumping seen in\nExperiment 1 is due mainly to ocean surface currents mod-\nifying the stress.\n[55] The Ekman pumping anomaly that is given by the\nlinear regression is essentially given by we\n0 = Eh0 where h0 is\nSSHA and E is a constant. Thus using equation (5) and iso-\nlating the time evolution and dissipation (through Ekman\npumping) terms we have\n@h0\n@t\n\u00bc \u0002 r\n0\nr0\nEh0 \u00fe . . . : \u00f09\u00de\n[56] Using equation (9) the approximate damping time-\nscale for the SSH can be derived. For E = 10\u00026m s\u00021 (from\nFigure 10), and using typical values of r0 = 1 kg m\u00023 and r0 =\n1025 kg m\u00023, the e-folding timescale is around 115 days.\nFigure 10.

TIWs are known to propagate between 100\u0001Wand\n160\u0001W [Contreras, 2002]; they can also occasionally be seen\njust west of the Galapagos islands and as far west as the\ndateline. Hence the effect of \u2018\u2018top drag\u2019\u2019 alone would be\nsufficient to damp away a TIW before reaching the end of its\npath. The reason it does not do so is because of continuous\namplification along the path through baroclinic and baro-\ntropic source terms (section 4).\n[57] The estimated decay time of the SSHA under Ekman\npumping (115 days) is longer than the EKE damping time\ncomputed in section 4.2 (50 days in the \u2018\u2018unmodified\u2019\u2019\nscenario). The difference may partly relate to the EKE being\na quadratic function of amplitude, so that its e-folding\ntimescale is half of that for amplitude alone.\n6. Discussion\n[58] The process of top-dragmay be added to themore well\nknown damping processes included in ocean models, such as\nmixing along isopycnal surfaces [Gent and McWilliams,\n1990], vertical diapycnal mixing [e.g., Large et al., 1994],\ninternal wave mixing [Jayne and St. Laurent, 2001], and\nbottom drag. It is clear that inclusion of the understress effect\nin a GCMwill require some reassessment of the impact of the\nimposed lateral and vertical mixing on the dynamics and\nthermodynamics of the ocean model. Further, this assessment\nshould ideally be done in a coupled model due to feedbacks\nbetween the ocean and atmosphere system [Richards et al.,\n2009; hereafter referred to as R2009].\n[59] The EKE in the understress experiment is reduced by\n10% or more in the latitude range 1\u0001S to 6\u0001N (Figure 2). This\nincludes the range close to the equator where the SST-wind\nfeedback is strong (e.g., south of 3\u0001N, Figure 8d).\nIt is therefore likely that the two feedbacks effects are not\nmutually exclusive in this region. As the understress effect\nmodifies the surface stress and heat fluxes, the evolving SST\nfield with understress will be different from that without, and\nhence the magnitude of the stress modulation due to wind-\nSST feedback will differ between experiments. (This was con-\nfirmed by analysis of the differences (Exp. 1 minus Exp. 2)\nin regressed stress curl near the equator, which were spatially\nrelated to differences in the regressed SST, not shown).\nHowever, north of 3\u0001N (away from the SST front), the damp-\ning of TIWs is almost exclusively due to the understress,\n(Figures 8 and 9).\n[60] Previous modeling studies have shown that TIWs are\nimportant to the heat budget of the eastern Equatorial Pacific\n[Vialard et al., 2001; Jochum et al., 2004; Jochum and\nMurtugudde, 2006; Menkes et al., 2006; Dutrieux et al.,\n2008]. At the surface, heat advection by the TIWs provides\nwarming in the Equatorial Front region [Vialard et al., 2001;\nde Szoeke et al., 2007], which acts against and almost bal-\nances the advection by the mean flow [de Szoeke et al., 2007;\nR2009]. The fact that TIW activity is reduced when\nunderstress is included suggests that the heat advection\nby TIWs will also be reduced. This has been confirmed by\nan analysis of the eastern equatorial Pacific mixed layer\nheat budget (not shown), following the method of R2009.\nHowever, there is a compensating effect in that the reduced\noverall easterly stress will lead to less upwelling and a\nweaker westward SEC, which acts to reduce the cooling\non and close to the equator. The net effect is that Exp. 1\nhas a reduction in mean SST (relative to Exp. 2) at\nlatitudes 2\u0001\u20134\u0001N in most months, peaking in August at\nabout 0.4\u0001C, with slight warming to the north of that, but a\nsmall SST difference on the equator, as seen in a monthly\nmean IROAM 8 year \u2018\u2018climatology\u2019\u2019 of the SST difference\n(between Exp. 1 and Exp. 2) averaged between120\u0001W and\n100\u0001W (Figure 11).\n7. Conclusions\n[61] In this paper we use a numerical model and satellite\nobservations to show that the inclusion of ocean current in the\nsurface stress (the so-called \u2018\u2018understress\u2019\u2019), has a significant\ndamping effect on eddies, a process originally predicted\ntheoretically by Dewar and Flierl [1987]. It thus adds to\nthe damping caused by modulations of surface stress by\natmospheric boundary layer response to SST gradients, and\nits feedback onto the ocean [Seo et al., 2007]. The results of\nthis paper also show that the surface currents of TIWs need\nto be known for proper estimation of stress in the eastern\nEquatorial Pacific.\n[62] When the surface current is included in the stress, the\nEddy Kinetic Energy of Tropical Instability Waves in the\nPacific Ocean is found to reduce by a factor of about 1.5.\nHowever, using a standard analysis of the EKE budget, the\neffect of understress on the damping of TIWs appears to be\nsmall. This is because the stress-damping term is dependent\non the correlation of the stress anomaly and the current\nanomaly, so that the damping term diminishes as the eddies,\nand their currents, weaken. A novel method is applied to the\nEKE budget to reveal the magnitude of the stress damping\nterm before the eddies have been weakened. This shows\nthat the EKE damping due to understress is comparable in\nsize to the barotropic and baroclinic conversion terms. In\nthe absence of generation and conversion terms, the under-\nstress would cause the EKE to decay on an e-folding\ntimescale of just 20\u201350 days, comparable to the time period\nof the TIWs.\n[63] Reasons for the EKE reduction were explored using\nregressions of the filtered surface stress fields onto indices of\nTIW activity, for model and observations. It was found that\nthe curl of the stress is influenced by both SST-wind feedback\nand understress, but in separate latitude bands. In the band\nfrom 3\u0001N to 8\u0001N, the curl of the stress is approximately\nproportional to the SSHA and the surface ocean vorticity in a\nfully coupled experiment, but not in the experiment with no\nunderstress. These results suggest that the understress is\nhaving a significant impact on the stress fields. This modu-\nlation of the curl of the stress leads to Ekman pumping\nanomalies and damping of the TIWs, the so-called \u2018\u2018top-\ndrag\u2019\u2019 effect by Dewar and Flierl [1987]. The Ekman\npumping anomalies compare well with a rough estimate\nwhich assumes that only the understress is modifying the\nstress. The consequent dissipation has an e-folding timescale\nof 115 days.\n[64] Finally, it is found that the reduction of TIW activity\ndue to understress has an effect on the surface and mixed\nlayer temperatures of the eastern Equatorial Pacific. At the\nEquatorial Front, a reduction of the heating by eddy advec-\nC04009 SMALL ET AL.: EDDY DAMPING DUE TO AIR-SEA COUPLING\n15 of 17\nC04009\ntion when understress is included leads to a cooler SST (by up\nto 0.4\u0001C) relative to the case with no understress. However,\non the equator, this cooling effect is compensated for by the\nreduced stress-driven upwelling, so the equatorial SST dif-\nference is small.\n[65] Acknowledgments.
