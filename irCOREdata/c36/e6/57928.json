Average \nconcentrations of NH3 were 82 \u00b1 17 nmol N m\n-3\n (error is s.d. of triplicate samples), \nwhile oxidised N concentrations in the gas phase (from trapping NO2 and HNO3) were \nsmaller, at 2.6 \u00b1 2.2 nmol N m\n-3\n, and gas-phase WSON concentrations were 18 \u00b1 11 \nnmol N m\n-3\n. The estimated collection efficiency of the nebulizing samplers for the \ngas-phase was 88 (\u00b18) % for NH3, 37 (\u00b116) % for NO2 and 57 (\u00b17) % for WSON; \nreported average concentrations have not been corrected for sampling efficiency. \nConcentrations in the particle phase were smaller, except for nitrate, at 21 \u00b1 9, 10 \u00b1 6 \nand 8 \u00b1 9 nmol N m\n-3\n, respectively. The absence of correlation in either phase \nbetween WSON and either (NH3+NH4\n+\n) or NO3\n-\n concentrations suggests atmospheric \nWSON has diverse sources. During wet days, concentrations of gas and particle-phase \ninorganic N were lower than on dry days, whereas the converse was true for WSON. \nThese data represent the first reports of simultaneous measurements of gas and \nparticle phase water-soluble nitrogen compounds in rural air on a daily basis, and \nshow that WSON occurs in both phases, contributing 20-25% of the total water-\nsoluble nitrogen in air, in good agreement with earlier data on the contribution of \nWSON to total dissolved N in rainfall in the UK. \n \n \nIntroduction \nMeasurements of organic N compounds (amines, amino acids, urea, alkyl nitrates, \nperoxyacyl nitrates, nitrophenols etc.) in air have been made for many years, but there \nhave been no reports of simultaneous total water-soluble organic N (WSON) in both \nthe gas and particle phases. The peroxyacyl nitrates are probably the best-known class \nof gas-phase organic N compounds in terms of atmospheric measurements, and \nperoxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) has been quantified in many recent studies, e.g. (Lee, et \nal., 2008, McFadyen and Cape, 2005, Roberts, et al., 2007, Zhang, et al., 2009, Zhang, \net al., 2005) as well as long-term studies over many years, e.g. (Bottenheim, et al., \n1999, Grosjean, 2003), with attempts made to quantify the relative contribution to \ntotal airborne oxidised N (NOy). An early study in Pennsylvania estimated that PAN \nconstituted 20-25% of total airborne oxidised reactive nitrogen, other organic nitrates \ncontributed 1.5%, and 15% of total NOy was unattributed, but behaved similarly to \norganic nitrates (Buhr, et al., 1990). However, subsequent research indicated that \nsome of this \u2018unattributed\u2019 contribution to NOy might have come from reduced N \n(NH3, NH4\n+\n and\/or amines) (Harrison, et al., 1999). The low aqueous solubility of \nPAN (Kames, et al., 1991)and many other organic N compounds implies that their \ncontribution to WSON might not, however, reflect their air concentrations.  \n \nThe role of organic N in precipitation, and its large contribution to wet N deposition \n(Cornell, et al., 2003, Neff, et al., 2002), has focused attention on WSON, and \nindividual components have been identified and quantified in the gas phase, aerosol \nphase and in precipitation, but no attempt has been made to quantify the total WSON \npresent in air as gases or particles. Ultimately, the gas and particle WSON provides \nthe dissolved organic N in precipitation, so an understanding of their air \nconcentrations may provide an indication of potential sources. Moreover, \nmeasurements of WSON in precipitation (wet deposition) are often made with \u2018bulk\u2019 \nPublished as Atmospheric Environment, 44, 1506-1514 (2010)  \ndoi: 10.1016\/j.atmosenv.2010.01.016 \n \nprecipitation collectors which are continuously exposed to the atmosphere. There is \nthe likelihood of a sampling artefact caused by dry deposition of gaseous and \nparticulate WSON on collector surfaces during dry periods prior to rainfall. A key \nfinding from recent experimental work is that dry deposition of particles and gas on \nthe funnel surface, rather than wet deposition, was the main contributor of N-\ncontaining species in bulk rain samples (between 53% and 84% of total N) (Gonz\u00e1lez \nBen\u00edtez, et al., 2009). Measurement of the contributory gas and aerosol phase \nconcentrations in air is therefore important for estimating the possible contribution of \nWSON to \u2018bulk\u2019 deposition.  \n \nThe contribution of WSON to total water-soluble N (WSN) in aerosols has been \nassessed in several studies, and appears to be on average around 30%, but variable \nwith time of year and location. In coastal or marine air, overall concentrations of \nWSON in particles are low, but may still provide a large proportion of WSN: average \n30% (up to 80%) in Hawaii (Cornell, et al., 2001), 26% in the eastern Mediterranean \n(Mace, et al., 2003c), 10% in Florida (Calderon, et al., 2007), 19-25% in Tasmania \n(Mace, et al., 2003b), 30% in Singapore (Karthikeyan, et al., 2009) and 10-24% in the \nEast China Sea (Nakamura, et al., 2006), where the smaller proportion was observed \nin spring and the larger in autumn. Similar proportions of WSON in aerosol WSN are \nseen in continental areas: 30% in Beijing (Duan, et al., 2009) and 43-45% in \nAmazonia (Mace, et al., 2003a). Radiation fog acts as scavenger of WSN and so \nwould be expected to reflect the combined contribution of both gas and aerosol \nphases; WSON contributed up to 16% of WSN in radiation fogs in California (Collett \nJr, et al., 2008, Zhang and Anastasio, 2001). \n \nThe experiments described here were designed to measure daily atmospheric \nconcentrations of the different water soluble nitrogen species in the boundary layer, in \norder to discriminate between what is in the gas phase and what is within particulate \nmatter, the particle phase. They provide, to our knowledge, the first simultaneous \nmeasurement of gaseous and particulate WSON as a component of WSN. \n \nExperimental \nStudy site and collection methods \nAtmospheric WSN components were sampled daily (usually for 24 h but with some \nsamples between 4 and 48 h) from both the gas and particle phases over 4 months \nbetween July and November 2008. In the first phase of sampling (23\nrd\n July to 21\nst\n \nAugust), samples were collected in the grounds of the Centre for Ecology & \nHydrology (3 12\u203219\u2033 W, 55 51\u203244\u2033 N) in a rural science park 15 km south west of \nEdinburgh and within 1 km of mixed farmland. In the main phase of sampling (26\nth\n \nAugust to 21\nst\n November), samples were collected at Easter Bush farm, less than 1 km \nto the north of the first site, in a grassland area mostly covered by perennial ryegrass \n(Lolium perenne) used for silage production and sheep grazing. Both sampling \nlocations were 190 m above sea level. \n \nGaseous WSN species were collected in Cofer samplers (Figure 1) which operate by \ndrawing air through a nebulizer to create a fine mist of droplets from an internal \nreservoir, into which the water-soluble gases partition (Cofer and Edahl, 1986, Sciare \nand Mihalopoulos, 2000, Spaulding, et al., 2002). Loss of mist droplets downstream \nof the sampler was prevented by use of a PTFE membrane filter that excluded liquid \nwater. The initial volume of water used in the reservoir of the Cofer samplers in this \nPublished as Atmospheric Environment, 44, 1506-1514 (2010)  \ndoi: 10.1016\/j.atmosenv.2010.01.016 \n \nstudy was 10 mL, and the average air flow rate was ca. 5 L min\n-1\n, just sufficient to \nmaintain nebulization in the chamber. The total volume of air sampled was measured \nusing a dry gas meter. A flow rate of 3 L min\n-1\n was sufficient to provide efficient \nnebulization with the nebulizer geometry used, and for most sampling a flow rate of 5 \nL min\n-1\n was used as a compromise between minimizing evaporation of the sampling \nsolution and maximising the volume of air sampled. Prior to sampling, all glassware \nwas soaked overnight in 15% (v\/v) dichlorodimethylsilane in toluene, then rinsed with \ntoluene, methanol, and dichloromethane (three times each) and dried at 150 C \n(Spaulding, et al., 2002). The silanization procedure makes the glass surfaces \nhydrophobic, thereby improving the recirculation of nebulised droplets within the \nsampler.  \n \nParticle-phase WSN species were collected on upstream PTFE membrane filters \n(Whatman, 47 mm diameter, 1 \u03bcm pore size) which removed aerosol particles from \nthe air stream prior to the nebulizer. Three samplers were used in this work: two had \nopen-faced filter holders at their inlets, which gave more uniform surface coverage for \naerosol capture but could be adversely affected by rain. The third had an enclosed \nfilter holder, with 0.5 cm diameter 3 cm long inlet, which prevented rain ingress but \nmay have provided less uniform surface area for particle filtration and possible loss of \ngaseous material (e.g. nitric acid) to the filter holder surface (Figure 1). Potential \nsampling artefacts caused by the inlet filter itself are discussed later. \n \nAt the CEH sampling site, the inlets of the Cofer samplers were placed 2 m above \nground, facing north-east. The main objective for this sampling phase was to evaluate \nthe collection efficiencies of the Cofer samplers and PTFE filters with respect to WSN \ncomponents. To evaluate \u2018breakthrough,\u2019 two of the Cofer samplers were connected \nin series, with the third sampler co-located in parallel. Flow rates for the two samplers \nin series were less than for a single sampler, typically 3 L min\n-1\n in series and 5 L min\n-1\n \nfor a single sampler. The lower flow rate was just sufficient to provide efficient \nnebulization. In the main sampling phase at Easter Bush, the three samplers were \noperated singly as replicates with their inlets 1 m above ground, facing south-west.  \n \nChemical analyses \nAfter sampling, the contents of the Cofer reservoir were collected via a syringe \nattached to the reservoir inlet. The sampler was then rinsed 3 times with a few mL of \n18 M\u03a9 cm water, to collect any water-soluble material retained on the internal \nsurfaces, and the rinsings added to the main solution. Sample volume was determined \nby weighing the collected sample and washings in a pre-silanized glass vial. Water-\nsoluble compounds in the particulate samples were extracted by immersing the PTFE \nfilters in 10 mL of 18 M\u03a9 cm water for two periods of 15 min in an ultrasonic bath \n(Duan, et al., 2009). Solutions were then filtered through a 0.2 \u00b5m pore-size inorganic \nmembrane filter (Whatman, Anotop 10 IC). The same procedure was applied to \n\u2018blank\u2019 samples of unexposed PTFE filters. All solutions were stored at 4oC prior to \nanalysis. No biocide was added as chemical analyses were always performed within a \nfew days after sample collection. \n \nEach sample was analysed for NH4\n+\n and NO3\n-\n by ion chromatography and for total \ndissolved nitrogen (TDN) by high-temperature catalytic oxidation and \nchemiluminescence detection of the resulting nitric oxide (ANTEK 8060-M nitrogen-\nspecific detector). The organic nitrogen component was calculated as the difference \nPublished as Atmospheric Environment, 44, 1506-1514 (2010)  \ndoi: 10.1016\/j.atmosenv.2010.01.016 \n \nbetween TDN and the sum of NH4\n+\n and NO3\n-\n. Full experimental details of the \nanalyses are given elsewhere (Gonz\u00e1lez Ben\u00edtez, et al., 2009). Typical detection limits \nwere 0.5 \u00b5M for NH4\n+\n and 0.4 \u00b5M for NO3\n-\n for a 250 \u00b5L injection and 1 \u00b5M N for \nTDN for a 30 \u00b5L injection, the latter based on independent calibration with standard \nsolutions of ammonium sulphate and sodium nitrate. Previous work has shown that \nthe ANTEK system quantitatively combusts all but the most intransigent organic \ncompounds (Cape, et al., 2001). The vast majority of analyses in this work were \nabove their limits of detection. Final concentrations of all components were expressed \nas nmol N m\n-3\n of air. Typical detection limits based on 10 mL solution and 24 h \nsampling at 5 L min\n-1\n are 0.7, 0.6 and 1.4 nmol N m\n-3\n for NH4\n+\n, NO3\n-\n and TDN, \nrespectively. The limit of detection for WSON is determined by a combination of the \noverall uncertainties in TDN and inorganic N analyses, and is best estimated from the \nprecision of the replicate analyses from the three parallel samplers, as illustrated in \nFigure 2. \n \nGas-phase WSN species sampling efficiency \nData from the first phase of sampling, 23\nrd\n July to 21\nst\n August 2008 at CEH, were \nused to evaluate sample collection methodology. Comparison of the concentrations \ncaptured by each of the two Cofer samplers in series showed that Cofer collection \nefficiency varied with WSN component measured. As expected, due to its high \naqueous solubility, sampling of gas phase NH3 (determined as NH4\n+\n) was very \nefficient, with average collection efficiency (% of total in both samplers) in the first \nsampler of 88 (\u00b1 8) % (n = 10, \u00b1 sd), and with no correlation between concentrations \nmeasured in first and second samplers.  \n \nThe collection efficiency of gas-phase oxidised nitrogen (measured as NO3\n-\n) in the \nfirst Cofer sampler was lower, and harder to determine since NO3\n-\n concentrations \nwere generally close to the analytical limits of detection but, on average, 63 (\u00b1 16) % \nof observed NO3\n-\n was in the first sampler, with again no correlation between \nconcentrations in first and second samplers. The Cofer NO3\n-\n derives from two gas-\nphase components, NO2 and HNO3, and also potentially from hydrolysis of organic \nnitrates. Nitric acid is highly soluble and expected to have close to 100% collection \nefficiency. On the other hand, NO2 has low Henry\u2019s Law solubility, although its \ntransfer into the Cofer solution is enhanced by its hydrolysis into NO3\n-\n and NO2\n-\n \n(Bambauer, et al., 1994), the NO2\n-\n subsequently reacting with dissolved oxidants \n(principally ozone) to yield NO3\n-\n also. If all the NO3\n-\n in the second sampler originates \nfrom NO2 the collection efficiency for NO2 would therefore be 37%. This calculation \nis consistent with the observation that at this sampling location the gas phase molar \nratio of NO2 to HNO3 is ~20, on average (Tang, et al., 2009). However, the relatively \nlarge variability between sampling periods in the proportion of nitrate in the two \nCofer samplers in series, although possibly reflecting fluctuations in the actual \natmospheric ratio of NO2 to HNO3, indicates the uncertainty in this calculation. \n \nThe average capture efficiency of gas-phase WSON in the first sampler was 57 (\u00b1 7) \n%, with much less variability in this proportion than for nitrate, but with a significant \ncorrelation (r\n2\n = 0.75, n=10) between concentrations in the first and second samplers. \nThis correlation implies that WSON concentration is approaching saturation in the \nfirst sampler, with breakthrough of gas-phase material to the second sampler. As for \ncollected nitrate, the WSON collected from the gas phase is likely to result from \ndifferent components of differing solubility. The sampling rate was greater during the \nPublished as Atmospheric Environment, 44, 1506-1514 (2010)  \ndoi: 10.1016\/j.atmosenv.2010.01.016 \n \nmain measurement period than when the Cofer samplers were operated in series, so \nthat the estimated capture efficiency of 57% is likely to overestimate the sampling \nefficiency of a single sampler. The atmospheric concentration data reported in this \npaper have therefore not been adjusted for collection efficiency, but represent a lower \nlimit, and could be a factor of 2 greater; the actual concentrations observed in \nprecipitation and clouds presumably also reflect partitioning between the gaseous and \naqueous phases, depending on the solubility of the individual components of WSON.  \n \nThere was no evidence of significant loss of gaseous HNO3 to deposition on the \nadditional surfaces of the sampler with a closed filter inlet (see Figure 1) compared \nwith the two samplers with open-face filter inlet (paired t-tests on log-transformed \nCofer nitrate concentrations from parallel samplers of each type during the Easter \nBush campaign).  \n \nParticle-phase ion balance  \nFor the excess NH3 conditions generally prevailing at these sampling localities, the \npredominant sources of particle-phase NH4\n+\n are NH4NO3 and (NH4)2SO4, which are \nalso the dominant source of particle-phase NO3\n-\n and SO4\n2-\n. Determination of the latter \nion was included in the IC analyses as an additional check, through ion balance, of \nparticle-phase sample collection. Thus, for particle-phase samples, the sum [NO3\n-\n + \n2*SO4\n2-\n] should equal, or exceed, particle [NH4\n+\n]. Figure 2 confirms significant linear \ncorrelation, and the gradient exceeding unity is consistent with an additional fraction \nof SO4\n2-\n of marine aerosol origin. The additional charge will be balanced by acidity or \ncations other than NH4\n+\n. \n \nArtefacts from use of a pre-filter  \nOperation of the Cofer sampler with a PTFE filter on the inlet might have led to \npotential artefacts. Any NH4NO3 collected on the filter could have decomposed to \ngive NH3 and HNO3 as air concentrations or temperature changed (Stelson and \nSeinfeld, 2007), so some of the WSN measured as \u2018gaseous\u2019 might have been \noriginally particulate. The average proportions of SO4\n2-\n and NO3\n-\n in the particle phase \nwere 7:3 (on an ion equivalent basis), implying that only around 30% of the \nparticulate NH4\n+\n was available as a potential source of \u2018artefact\u2019 gaseous data, as \n(NH4)2SO4 is not volatile. However, given the relatively large gas-phase NH3 \nconcentrations, any effect of such particle decomposition on NH3 concentration is \nlikely to be small. The effect on gas-phase NO3\n-\n concentration could have been \nsignificant, given the rather small overall NO3\n-\n concentrations from the gas-phase, but \nmany of these data were close to the limit of detection and made an insignificant \ncontribution to overall WSN concentrations. Based on average concentrations (Table \n1) even if all the NO3\n-\n detected in the gas-phase had originally been present as \nparticles, the loss of particulate NO3\n-\n would be ca. 20%, but in practice any \ncontribution from NO2 and HNO3 to NO3\n-\n measured in the Cofer sampler would \nreduce this potential artefact. In practice, loss rates over 24h from PTFE are likely to \nbe around 20% or less (Yu, et al., 2006). The low flow rates, and generally low \ntemperature at the site, would also mitigate against such artefacts. Another source of \nuncertainty is the possibility that gaseous WSON molecules were adsorbed by the \nPTFE filter and thereby prevented from entering the Cofer sampler \u2013 this would lead \nto an apparently greater contribution of WSON in the particle phase. However, by \ntheir very nature, WSON species are likely to be polar molecules with little affinity \nfor PTFE, so any artefact is likely to be small. \nPublished as Atmospheric Environment, 44, 1506-1514 (2010)  \ndoi: 10.1016\/j.atmosenv.2010.01.016 \n \n \nQuality control criteria \nSampling from the gas phase by Cofer sampler assumes that the mist remains a sink \nfor water-soluble species and does not approach solution equilibrium. Depletion of the \nsampler reservoir by evaporation may cause the aqueous concentration of WSN \nspecies to become saturated, leading to inefficient removal or partitioning back into \nthe gas phase. Evaporation from the single Cofer sampler was considerably greater \nthan from Cofer samplers in series because of the greater flow rates with a single \nsampler, enabling investigation of the effect of reservoir evaporation on capture \nefficiency. For all sampling dates, NH4\n+\n concentration in the single sampler was, on \naverage, 83% of the concentration in the first of the two samplers in series, but was \n101% (R\n2\n = 0.98) when only dates on which the single sampler had final reservoir \nvolume greater than 3 mL were included. This volume was therefore chosen as the \nminimum volume required to be remaining in a Cofer sampler at the end of a \nsampling period for the sample to be regarded as valid. Applying this criterion \nresulted in 9 of 132 Cofer samples collected during the main sampling campaign \nbeing discarded. \n \nFor the particle-phase samples, there was no significant difference in concentrations \nof particle-phase total WSN species determined from parallel samplers with enclosed \nor open-face inlet PTFE filters (linear gradient 1.03, R\n2\n = 0.94, n = 10). Both types of \nfilter sampler were therefore retained for the second phase of sampling at Easter Bush. \nTo investigate the concern that particle-phase material on open-face filters may be \nsubject to loss during rain events, total WSN concentrations derived from the two \nfilter holders were compared separately for sampling dates with zero or light rain only \nand for dates with heavy rainfall. On the former dates, the linear gradient of total \nWSN from enclosed versus open-face filters was 0.94 (R\n2\n = 0.99) while on the latter \ndates the gradient was 1.14 (R\n2\n = 0.97). The difference in gradients was not \nstatistically significant, although the trend is consistent with the hypothesis that the \nunprotected open-face filters may be prone to loss of water-soluble particle-phase \nmaterial in wet weather. As a precaution against potential bias, 23 out of 168 filter \nsamples collected in the main sampling campaign where open-face filter samples \nyielded lower total WSN air concentrations than the parallel enclosed sampler were \ndiscarded from the dataset.  \n \nDates where the relative standard deviation of the measurements from the 3 parallel \nreplicate Cofer or filter samples exceeded 100% were regarded as \u2018suspicious\u2019 and \nalso removed. The final dataset for the main sampling campaign at Easter Bush site \ncomprised 38 and 47 sets of \u2018valid\u2019 Cofer and filter samples, respectively. \n \nResults \nTime series of the atmospheric concentrations of the measured gas and particle-phase \nWSN species at Easter Bush are shown in Figure 3. The time series are plotted as \nrelative abundances of WSN species in each of the gas and particle phases in Figure 4. \nConcentrations differed substantially between species and were generally higher in \nthe gas phase (except for oxidised inorganic nitrogen). Ammonia was the dominant \nWSN species overall, and NH4\n+\n was also the most abundant WSN species in the \nparticle phase. Significant amounts of WSON were present in both phases.  \n \nPublished as Atmospheric Environment, 44, 1506-1514 (2010)  \ndoi: 10.1016\/j.atmosenv.2010.01.016 \n \nOn 28\nth\n August nitrogen fertilizer was applied to the field surrounding the sampling \nlocation at the rate of 35 kg N ha\n-1\n as urea. The gas-phase NH3 concentration of 512 \u00b1 \n8 nmol N m\n-3\n measured on this date was more than 6 times larger than the average \nconcentration of 77 nmol N m\n-3\n for the other 36 dates with 3 valid replicates (after \nremoval of data for 12\nth\n September also, see below). The WSON concentration was \neffectively zero, implying no direct loss of urea to the gas phase. This observation \nsuggests that an important fraction of the urea applied to the soil was lost due to \nvolatilization into the atmosphere as ammonia (Ball and Ryden, 1984, Fillery, et al., \n1986). Given the clear causal factor to the \u2018outlier\u2019 data on this occasion, this date was \nnot included in subsequent statistical summaries of general trends.  \n \nA large NH3 concentration of 386 \u00b1 61 nmol N m\n-3\n was also observed on 12\nth\n \nSeptember, a value about 5 times the long-term average of the remaining dates. It is \nknown that no fertilizer was applied at the sampling location at this date, although the \npossibility that fertilizer was applied on a field nearby cannot be excluded. However, \ngiven that the NH3 value was so large, this date was also not included in subsequent \nstatistical summaries.  \n \nTable 1 summarises the means and medians of the individual WSN concentrations, \ntogether with their average contributions to the total WSN measured in each phase, \nfor the subset of 33 dates having valid data for both phases simultaneously. There was \nno substantive difference in summary statistics when using this subset of 33 dates \n(compared with the larger datasets of dates having valid data in each phase \nseparately), and it provides a matched dataset across the two phases. Table 1 also \nincludes the standard deviations of within-triplicate-sample variability and between-\nday variability, for each component in each phase, as apportioned using one-way \nANOVA (see Table caption). The former statistic provides a measure of sampler and \nanalytical replicability, whilst the latter is a measure of the species variability over the \nwhole period of study. For the full dataset, between-day variability was always highly \nsignificantly larger than within-replicate-sample variability. Corresponding data for \nthe variabilities in the relative proportions of each component in each phase area also \npresented. \n \nThe data in Table 1 quantify that substantially more WSN was present in the gas \nphase than in the particulate phase: the sums of the average concentrations of \nmeasured WSN components were 103 nmol N m\n-3\n in the gas-phase (range 27-275, sd \n59) across the 33 dates, and 38 nmol N m\n-3\n (range 5-154, sd 34) in the particle phase. \nThis difference was driven primarily by the dominance of NH3 as a WSN species in \nthe gas-phase (average concentration 82 nmol N m\n-3\n), but gas phase WSON species \nwere also an important contributor with average concentration 18 nmol N m\n-3\n. The \nconcentration of water-soluble gas-phase oxidised inorganic nitrogen, determined as \nNO3\n-\n and presumed to derive from both HNO3 and NO2, was <3 nmol N m\n-3\n on \naverage (actual gas phase concentration of NO2 will be higher since it has low \naqueous solubility.) Using these campaign-average concentrations of each component \ngives contributions of NH3, NO3\n-\n and WSON to total measured gas-phase WSN of \n80%, 2% and 18%, respectively. Alternatively, taking the average of the proportions \non individual sampling dates gives contributions of NH3, NO3\n-\n and WSON to total \ngas-phase WSN of 77%, 3% and 20%, respectively. However, there was large day-to-\nday variation in individual species concentrations around these average values, as \nillustrated in Figure 3, and by the magnitude of the standard deviations in species \nPublished as Atmospheric Environment, 44, 1506-1514 (2010)  \ndoi: 10.1016\/j.atmosenv.2010.01.016 \n \nconcentrations and their proportions within total WSN across sampling dates (Table \n1). The ANOVA analysis provides estimated between-day standard deviations on the \naverage daily proportions of 77 \u00b1 11, 3 \u00b1 3 and 20 \u00b1 9% for NH3, NO3\n-\n and WSON, \nrespectively. \n \nIn the particle phase, NH4\n+\n was the dominant WSN species (average concentration 21 \nnmol N m\n-3\n), but less so than in the gas phase, whilst NO3\n-\n and WSON concentrations \nwere comparable (10 and 8 nmol N m\n-3\n, on average, respectively). These campaign-\naverage concentration values correspond to contributions to total measured particle-\nphase WSN of 54%, 26% and 20% for NH4\n+\n, NO3\n-\n and WSON respectively. Or, using \nthe average of the daily sample proportions, relative contributions of NH4\n+\n, NO3\n-\n and \nWSON to particle-phase WSN comprised 45 \u00b1 19%, 25 \u00b1 12% and 30 \u00b1 22%, \nrespectively, where the quoted \u00b1 values are again the estimated between-day standard \ndeviations in daily contributions to WSN in that phase (Table 1). Overall, these \nsummary analyses indicate that for this sampling campaign WSON contributed ~20% \non average to gas-phase WSN (with NH3 ~77%, NO3\n-\n ~3%) and ~25% on average to \nparticle-phase WSN (with NH4\n+\n ~50%, NO3\n-\n ~25%), with somewhat greater day-to-\nday variability in these proportions in the particle-phase than in the gas-phase.   \n \nFigure 5 shows the proportions of daily WSON and total WSN which were present in \nthe gas phase during the sampling campaign. The averages (\u00b1 1 sd) of the proportions \nin the gas phase across all valid sampling dates, for each of the measured WSN \ncomponents, are shown in Figure 6 and were 80 \u00b1 19% for NH3\/ NH4\n+\n, 30 \u00b1 22% for \nNO3\n-\n, 67 \u00b1 15% for WSON, and 74 \u00b1 16% for the sum of all the measured WSN \ncomponents. The majority of water soluble oxidised inorganic nitrogen (NO3\n-\n) was \npresent in particles (as expected), whereas the majority of reduced inorganic nitrogen \nwas present in the gas phase. WSON was also predominantly in the gas phase. \nHowever, as illustrated by the standard deviations and the individual sample data in \nFigure 5, the splits between the phases varied from day to day.  \n \nDiscussion \nA single-plot summary of the concentrations of measured WSN species in the gas and \nparticle phases for the subset of 33 days in the sampling period 26\nth\n August 2008 to \n21\nst\n November 2008 at Easter Bush is shown in Figure 7, which illustrates the large \ndifferences in atmospheric concentrations between components and phases.  \n \nThe concentrations of the water-soluble inorganic components measured at Easter \nBush are compared in Table 2 with data from monthly samples collected by denuder \nat the CEH site as part of a long-term atmospheric sampling network (Tang, et al., \n2009). Given the differences in sample collection periods between the two \nmeasurements noted in the table caption, the values agree very well. The agreement is \nbetter for particles than for the gases, as would be expected; particle concentrations \ntend to be less spatially variable because of long transport distances and slow dry \ndeposition. Similar behaviour would be expected for NO2 and HNO3 unless there \nwere major local sinks for the gases between the two sampling sites, either as rough \nvegetation or large NH3 sources. There was no major landscape sink for NO2 and \nHNO3 between the two sites, but emissions and concentrations of NH3 were likely to \nhave been higher at the Easter Bush site, possibly leading to removal of HNO3 as \nNH4NO3 particles. For NH3, however, local variability can be very great, particularly \nin an agricultural landscape with multiple sources. The Easter Bush site is in the \nPublished as Atmospheric Environment, 44, 1506-1514 (2010)  \ndoi: 10.1016\/j.atmosenv.2010.01.016 \n \nmiddle of a fertilized and grazed grass field, which would be expected to sustain \nhigher NH3 concentrations than the fallow field surrounding the long-term monitoring \nsite; the observation of consistently lower NH3 concentrations at the latter is therefore \nnot unexpected. \n \nThe generally lower concentrations of atmospheric WSN species apparent in Figure 3 \nfor the period 2\nnd\n \u2013 21st October did not appear to be related to sustained differences \nin temperature, rainfall or wind direction between this period and the rest of the \nsampling campaign. Instead, the likely explanation is the coincident removal of sheep \nfrom the grazing field immediately upwind (SW) of the sampling site between 24\nth\n \nSeptember and 20\nth\n October inclusive.  \n \nThe proportion of organic N within total WSN in the gas phase (~20%) was similar to \nthat in the particle phase (~25%). The average contribution of organic N in rainfall at \nBush measured in preceding years (Gonz\u00e1lez Ben\u00edtez, et al., 2009) was 12-36% in wet \ndeposition and up to 33% in dry deposition, from funnel washings. The sampling \nperiods were at different times of year, making direct comparison difficult, but the \nlarger relative contribution of organic N to \u2018dry deposition\u2019 implies that such material \nis less volatile than the major inorganic contributor (NH3) and is less likely to be \nrevolatilised from surfaces after deposition.  \n \nThe main components contributing to the Cofer solution NO3\n-\n are gas phase NO2 and \nHNO3. These have very different sources to gas phase NH3. The former are secondary \natmospheric oxidation products derived from emissions of oxidised nitrogen \n(principally NO) from combustion sources, i.e. urban and traffic-related, whereas the \noverwhelming source of NH3 is primary emission in rural areas, from farms in \nparticular, from decomposition and volatilization of animal wastes. At the rural Easter \nBush sampling location, sources of NH3 are local, whereas NO2 and HNO3 are \nderived from more distant sources (the city of Edinburgh and longer range). The \npredominance of NH3 in the measured gas-phase WSN at this site indicates the \ninfluence of these local sources. \n \nThe source of NH4\n+\n and NO3\n-\n within the particle-phase is NH4NO3 and (NH4)2SO4. \nThese are secondary particulate matter components formed mainly by the reaction of \nnitric and sulphuric acids with NH3. The NO3\n-\n measured in the particle phase was \nmore than three times that in the gas phase indicating the favourable formation of \ncondensed-phase inorganic material when NH3 is present in excess, as at this locality, \nwith relatively low temperatures and high relative humidity. However, whilst some of \nthe secondary inorganic components measured here may have formed locally and \nrecently, accumulation mode particles can have a lifetime of several days so can also \nbe transported over large distances.  \n \nWSON was an important fraction of both gas and particle-phase WSN at this location. \nPotential commonality of source was explored by examining correlations between \ndaily concentrations of the measured WSN components in each phase (Table 3). \nThere was highly significant correlation between NO3\n-\n and NH4\n+\n in the particle phase, \nas expected given their common source of NH4NO3 particles, but no other significant \ncorrelation. The absence of substantive correlation between WSON and (NH3+NH4\n+\n) \nor oxidised inorganic nitrogen suggests that the WSON at this location is not strongly \nassociated with either combustion or agricultural sources alone. Instead, the weakly \nPublished as Atmospheric Environment, 44, 1506-1514 (2010)  \ndoi: 10.1016\/j.atmosenv.2010.01.016 \n \npositive associations of WSON with both NO3\n-\n and NH3 possibly simply reflect \ncommon meteorological conditions that lead to correlations across all airborne \nspecies, but suggest it is likely that WSON comprises material emanating from a \nvariety of sources, anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic, both local and further \nafield. These findings are consistent with the conclusion from a recent study of marine \naerosols that WSON species contain both biogenic and anthropogenic components \n(Facchini, et al., 2008). In that study, WSON concentrations were higher in polluted \nair masses than in clean ones but the dimethyl- and diethylammonimum salts within \nthe WSON (taken to be of biogenic origin) were larger in the clean air masses. \n \nThe 33 sampling days with valid measurements for both the gas and particle phases \nwere sub-divided according to whether the sampling day was dry (17 days) or had \nrain (16 days). The mean and median concentrations and proportions of each \nmeasured WSN component for the two weather categories separately are also \nincluded in Table 1. The concentrations of gas-phase NH3 and water-soluble oxidised \ninorganic nitrogen (sampled as NO3\n-\n) were significantly lower on wet days than dry \ndays (p = 0.012 and 0.028, respectively; ANOVA on log-transformed data). Mean \nNH3 concentrations were 100 and 63 nmol N m\n-3\n on dry and wet days respectively, \nand mean NO3\n-\n concentrations were 3.3 and 1.8 nmol N m\n-3\n. The depleted \nconcentrations on wet days are not surprising since rain is expected to scrub highly \nwater-soluble material from the boundary layer. Conversely, mean concentrations of \ngas-phase WSON were slightly greater on wet days (20 nmol N m\n-3\n) than on dry days \n(16 nmol N m\n-3\n), a difference just reaching statistical significance (p = 0.036). As \ndiscussed above in relation to interpretation of the Cofer sampler carryover \nexperiments, WSON includes species that are less water soluble than NH3 and HNO3. \nThis may account for the smaller differences between dry and wet days for WSON.  \n \nThe concentration of particle-phase WSON was also significantly higher on wet \nsampling days than on dry days, with mean concentrations of 11 and 5 nmol N m\n-3\n, \nrespectively (p = 0.008, ANOVA on log-transformed data). Concentrations of \nparticle-phase NO3\n-\n and NH4\n+\n  were not significantly different between wet and dry \ndays.  \n \nThere was no evidence for systematic differences in local wind direction (indicative \nof air-mass origin) between wet and dry days which might have indicated changes to \ncontributing WSN sources to account for the enhancement of WSON on wet days. \nOne possible explanation is that the wetting of the surrounding soil and\/or vegetation \n(perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne) by rainfall promotes release of volatile nitrogen-\ncontaining compounds. Similarly, the impact of rain droplets on leaves or soil may \ncause mechanical (re)suspension of particles back into the lower boundary layer. The \nscrubbing effect of rainfall would also still occur but the net effect of all these \nprocesses will depend on the intensity, duration and periodicity of rain events. This \nexplanation is consistent with observations reported in previous studies (Calderon, et \nal., 2007), in which the poor rain scavenging of fine particles of NH4\n+\n  and WSON \n(anticipated as the main contributors to particle-phase WSN at this sampling location) \nwas attributed to low collision efficiencies, even in the presence of a high number of \nbig droplets. \n \n \n \nPublished as Atmospheric Environment, 44, 1506-1514 (2010)  \ndoi: 10.1016\/j.atmosenv.2010.01.016 \n \nConclusions  \nCofer samplers are effective and inexpensive samplers for water-soluble gases, easy \nto handle, to transport and to operate. Either open-face or enclosed membrane filters \nat the inlet to the sampler can be used to collect simultaneous samples of particulate \nmatter. \n \nIn this study the total concentration of WSN was considerably higher in the gas phase \nthan in the particle phase, the former dominated by NH3. On average the sum of gas-\nphase NH3, oxidised inorganic nitrogen (mainly HNO3) and WSON was 103 nmol N \nm\n-3\n, apportioned ~77%, 3% and 20%, on average, whilst the sum of particle-phase \nNH4\n+\n, NO3\n-\n and WSON was 38 nmol N m\n-3\n, apportioned ~50%, 25% and 25%, on \naverage. The fraction of each measured WSN component that was in the gas-phase \n(relative to the sum of gas and particle phase concentrations) was, on average, 80 \u00b1 \n19% for (NH3+NH4\n+\n), 30 \u00b1 22% for NO3\n-\n, and 67 \u00b1 15% for WSON (\u00b11 sd for 33 \nsampling days). These data summaries exclude days when nitrogen fertilizer was \napplied in the locality, when measured NH3 concentrations reached up to ~6 times the \nlonger term average.  \n \nThe WSON concentrations in the gas and particle-phase samples were only weakly \ncorrelated with reduced and oxidised inorganic nitrogen. This suggests that the \nWSON measured at this location was not primarily associated with just one or other \nof agricultural or combustion-related sources but likely has contributions from both \nanthropogenic and non-anthropogenic sources, both local and further afield. The gas \nand particle-phase WSON was also greater, on average, on wet days than on dry days \n(in contrast to WSIN), suggesting potential local release of WSON material from \nwetting and mechanical action of rain on surrounding soil and grassland. \n \nAcknowledgements \nStudentship funding for JMGB from the University of Edinburgh School of \nChemistry is gratefully acknowledged.
