MTutor presents teachers with complex real-life teaching problems, which they are\nrequired to solve online through collaboration with other teachers.

Most Integrated Masters Module\nProgramme students work full time and are distributed across a large geographical\narea, so module delivery must be flexible. The \u2018Information and Communication\nTechnology: Theoretical Perspectives\u2019 module was designed with these needs in\nmind, and is delivered through a managed learning environment in a hybrid blend.\nBlended delivery is through face-to-face teaching and learning (lectures, seminars,\ngroup work and discussion), online delivery (electronic resources, threaded discus-\nsion, problem-based learning [PBL] scenarios and online multiple response question\n*Corresponding author. Faculty of Education, University of Plymouth, Drake Circus, Ply-\nmouth PL4 8AA, UK. Email: steve.wheeler@plymouth.ac.uk\n126 S. Wheeler et al.\nassessment), videoconferencing and distance tutorial support (synchronous via\ntelephone, asynchronous via email).\nThe online element of the module is presented in a problem-based format, where\nstudents immerse themselves within situated aspects of the theory such as \u2018real\npurpose tasks\u2019 and transformed teacher roles (Jonassen, 1996). Strategic videoconfer-\nence sessions are interspersed throughout the module to introduce forthcoming\ntutorials and consolidate previous tutorials. Using this blend of delivery methods, the\nmodule offers dispersed student groups a dynamic and discursive environment within\nwhich to explore and discuss course materials.\nUnderpinning design principles of MTutor\nThe managed learning environment used to deliver the \u2018Information and Communi-\ncation Technology: Theoretical Perspectives\u2019 module is called MTutor. It was\ndesigned to be used as a \u2018Mindtool\u2019 rather than as \u2018shovelware\u2019. Many lecturers trans-\nfer their course notes and learning resources over to webpages and erroneously expect\nstudents to use them with no tutorial support (Forsyth, 2001). This practice has been\nscathingly labelled as \u2018shovelware\u2019, a practice that has contributed to a growing\ndiscontent with online teaching methods. Jonassen et al. (1999), however, call for the\ncomputer to be used as a \u2018mindtool\u2019 to promote open-ended learning. The mindtools\napproach challenges the established \u2018computer-based learning approach\u2019 where\nknowledge resided in the machine and was systematically delivered to the student.\nInstead, students bring their knowledge to the computer, which provides a sort of\n\u2018mental gymnasium\u2019 within which the student can \u2018workout\u2019 to build new knowledge\nthrough proactive exploration and collaboration with others. MTutor performs these\nmindtool functions, by providing the remote student with a combination of meaning-\nful, open-ended learning experiences in a flexible, non-linear environment.\nMTutor hosts a threaded discussion group facility and a range of multiple-choice\nand multiple-response question options. MTutor has been successfully used to offer\nmodules in health studies, engineering and psychology (Culverhouse & Burton,\n1998, 2001), although each of these was implemented within a networked on-campus\nbased environment. In our context, MTutor is used for the first time as a platform for\nonline distance learning, with an emphasis on PBL.\nProblem-based learning\nPBL methods were first developed to address the difficulties inherent in conventional\nteaching and learning (Barrows, 2002), and serve to facilitate deeper levels of cogni-\ntive engagement. PBL strongly promotes the development of skills through the use of\ncomplex, real-life problems and motivates students to adopt deeper approaches to\nstudy (Duch et al., 2001), promoting critical thinking, collaborative learning, verbal\nand written communication skills and lifelong learning skills. The power of PBL lies\nin its facility to present learners with authentic problems they might encounter in the\n\u2018real world\u2019. Students must also practice problem-solving skills while reading more\nInfluence of online PBL on teachers 127\nwidely and investigating more deeply the structure and context of the presented\nproblem. PBL tutors tend to act as guides and facilitators in the process, and may\neven adopt a learning role themselves (Roblyer et al., 1997).\nOnline PBL is sometimes referred to as distributed PBL and is a version of PBL\nthat is useful to students who are separated from their tutors by distance. Learning\nis mediated through online technologies within a shared, \u2018virtual\u2019 distributed learn-\ning environment. This distributed community of practice (Wenger, 1998) encour-\nages a self-regulating and autonomous body of students. Lave and Wenger\u2019s (1991)\nnotion of \u2018communities of practice\u2019 is based upon the idea that learning involves a\ndeepening process of participation in a social group over a period of time. They use\nthe related notions of \u2018legitimate peripheral participation\u2019 and \u2018situated learning\u2019 to\nexplain the way in which learners move from the margins of a group, gradually\napproximating to its core, and associate this movement with learning. The\n\u2018communities of practice\u2019 model was applied to the development of the online\nmodule.\nAt the start of the module, students are encouraged to collaborate as a team with\neach monitoring the progress of others while at the same time assessing their own\n(Barrows, 2002). Online collaborative knowledge building approaches have previ-\nously been used to promote effective learning in inservice teacher training (Ahlberg\net al., 2001) and to establish communities of practice in computer-mediated commu-\nnication-based initial teacher training (Clarke, 2002; Tsui & Ki, 2002).\nSituated cognition\nWe define PBL as learning based on the \u2018thinking through\u2019 of real-life problems or,\nmore precisely, situated cognition. Of course, everyday problems are rarely clear cut\nin nature, as many have no structure and may bear no similarities to previously\nencountered problems. Problem-solving is arguably one of the most important skills\nany student can acquire, as it enables generalisability across diverse problems. We\nencounter problems every day, some of which merely take a minute or two to solve.\nOthers take days, weeks or even years to circumvent, and then often with no guaran-\ntee of success. Problem-solving should therefore be viewed not as a product, but as a\nkey component of the lifelong learning process, drawing on many cognitive resources\nand requiring much commitment and practice. In our view the effective representa-\ntion of problems is best achieved in a situated context, and for teachers operating\nwithin a community of practice this is crucial. To emulate real-life teaching situations,\nproblems can be constructed that have more than one possible solution, and with\nlimited information to solve them. We refer to this form of situated mindtool as the\n\u2018ill structured problem\u2019.\nIll-structured problems\nPresenting students with ill-structured problems has a number of pedagogical\nadvantages. Simon (1973) shows that because they are primarily representative of\n128 S. Wheeler et al.\nreal-life situations they have practical applications, and argues that ill-structured\nproblems exhibit three key characteristics. First, they exhibit greater complexity and\nhave less definite criteria for determining when the problem has been solved.\nSecond, not all the information has been provided in the presentation of the prob-\nlem, leaving several gaps for the learner to fill in. Finally, ill-structured problems\nhave no apparent \u2018rules\u2019 that can be immediately applied (Simon, 1978). It is also\nconceivable that ill-structured problems offer better generalisability potential across\ndiverse problem types. However, the extent to which a problem is ill-structured\nmay depend upon the skills and knowledge that the learner brings to bear on the\nproblem.\nLearners with the requisite knowledge may perceive a problem to be better defined\nthan those with no, or little, knowledge (Frederiksen, 1984). Moreover, student-\ncentred learning can be supported using ill-structured problem-solving. For example,\nill-structured problems tend to encourage learners to define the problem themselves\n(Kahney, 1994). This leads in turn to greater motivation through ownership and,\nultimately, the construction of personal meaning within individualised professional\npractice contexts. Ill-structured problems, then, are useful to present to groups of\nstudents who have differing levels of experience and knowledge, making for a diverse\ncommunity of practice.\nWithin the structure of the online module are four tutorials, each of which presents\nthe student with an ill-structured problem for them to consider. In our module, the\nfirst problem-based scenario, for example, takes the form of a heated debate between\ntwo teachers in the staff room. One teacher is opposed to the use of computers across\nthe curriculum, while the other is a strong advocate. This polemic is analysed by the\nstudents, and a range of theoretical and practical issues can be teased out which they\nlater discuss online and during the videoconferences within their community, which\nincludes their peers and the module tutors.\nThe influence of online learning on professional practice and identity\nIn PBL, each student will generally abstract the meaning he\/she feels to be upper-\nmost both from an examination of the problem space and in the presented\ndialogue, and this will invariably be an issue or set of issues that impact upon his\/\nher own professional practice in some way. Some students may recognise elements\nof their own professional practice represented in the PBL scenarios, or may identify\nthe attitudes or beliefs of their colleagues from, say, a dialogue around the problem.\nDiscussion of these issues often brings about a greater sense of self-awareness and\na deeper examination of one\u2019s own professional practices and mores, leading to a\nchallenge on professional identity. Professional identity is the teacher\u2019s representa-\ntion of the self within the context of professional practice. It emerges from an itera-\ntive process of reflection on practice through continual evaluation of performance.\nIt can be argued that, in online environments, professional identity can be shaped\nand influenced most keenly through engagement within mediated discussion\ngroups.\nInfluence of online PBL on teachers 129\nThe argumentative nature of the ensuing online rhetoric encourages each student\nto challenge and further construct, deconstruct and reconstruct their own personal\nsense of meaning from the problem and its implications. This reflective process\nshould have an impact upon the professional identity each is in the process of forming\nand reforming, challenging their assumptions and modifying their images of the self\nin a professional context.\nFurthermore, the discursive dialogue that takes place can in itself create a zone of\nproximal development (ZPD). The ZPD represents the extent to which a learner can\nacquire skills and knowledge, given the support of a more knowledgeable peer\n(Vygotsky, 1962, 1978). Thus, for each learner and over a period of time, a mutual\nsupport climate is developed as the learner\u2019s cognitive development is incrementally\nshifted through a process of negotiation through peer dialogue. The ZPD tends to be\nvariable, based upon the context of each problem and the extent to which each\nstudent possesses the skills, knowledge and attitude to support peers or be supported.\nBaron and Misovich (1993) claim that the Vygotskian ideal of the ZPD can be\nextended to encompass a group-mediated \u2018zone of proximal change\u2019.\nWe can connect the notion of ZPD and the \u2018scaffolding\u2019 of learning to that of a\ncommunity of practice, where learning is linked to the facilitative practices associated\nwith working with colleagues, peers and tutors. The kind of learning proposed by\nLave and Wenger (1991) is not necessarily a narrow cognitive notion of learning or\nthe simple acquisition of skills. Rather, it is a kind of collective learning organised\naround some particular area of knowledge and activity giving members a sense of joint\nenterprise and identity. For a community of practice to function it needs to generate\na shared repertoire of ideas, commitments and memories. It also needs to develop\nvarious resources such as tools, documents, routines, vocabulary and symbols that in\nsome way carry the accumulated knowledge of the community. In the online module,\nthe online discussion and videoconferencing are used as mindtools to facilitate these\nactivities.\nIt is possible that synchronous mindtools such as videoconferencing may provide\nmore immediacy for social exchange that their asynchronous counterparts. Humans\nare social beings who depend upon feedback from their peers to validate their own\nbeliefs (Jonassen, 1998) and online discussions, both synchronous and asynchronous,\nare fertile environments within which this kind of self-examination of identity can be\npropagated.\nIncreased awareness of online learning has been accompanied by the need for\nteachers to understand the potential for changes in identity and also the ability to\nswitch identities in different contexts. Students enrolling for the online module tend\nto be acutely aware of their practice styles and professional identity as many have\nseveral years of teaching experience. However, those who are na\u00efve to the use of\nelectronic communications media are unaware of what might constitute their online\nidentity. Turkle (1997) suggests that online identity is often different to \u2018real-life\u2019\nidentity, and that the online personae can change according to the context of the\nonline experience. Although Turkle\u2019s commentary was descriptive of the online\ngaming scene, we believe it to be equally applicable to online learning.\n130 S. Wheeler et al.\nThe case study\nMTutor presents teachers with complex real-life teaching problems, which they are\nrequired to solve online through collaboration with other teachers. We were inter-\nested in exploring the influence of this online learning experience on identity and\nprofessional practice. We therefore conducted a small-scale study to try and answer\nthe following questions: \n\u25cf To what extent do the online learners develop different identities to manage their\nonline identity in comparison with their everyday \u2018real-life\u2019 identities?\n\u25cf Do the online experiences of teachers impact upon their \u2018real world\u2019 style of profes-\nsional practice and does changing identities have any influence?\nA semi-structured interview schedule was created to address the issues that the three\nresearch team members agreed to be salient to the research questions. A small group\nof six students who had recently completed the online module as a whole cohort were\nrecruited by email for the study.\nAs two of the authors had previously tutored on the course, a research assistant\nunknown to the group individually interviewed each student. Each of the interviews\nlasted between 30 and 60 minutes. The tape recordings of the interviews were tran-\nscribed and then the content of their responses was analysed by the research team.\nQuestions focused on individual encounters with the online module, asking each\nparticipant to reflect in particular on their experiences studying online, their online\nand \u2018real-life\u2019 identities, and also any changes in their professional practice styles.\nParticipants were also encouraged to elaborate within the schedule of questions.\nAnalysis and discussion\nThe six students in this case study had a range of backgrounds and experiences: \n\u25cf Student 1: Was a primary school teacher, has a B.Ed. degree, and now teaches\nInitial  Teacher Training (ITT) in the Faculty of Education at the University of\nPlymouth. He is in his early 40s.\n\u25cf Student 2: Is a civilian educator teaching Adult Basic Skills, within the Prison\nservice. He has a B.A. degree and is in his mid 40s.\n\u25cf Student 3: Was previously a service engineer and now teaches information and\ncommunication technology (ICT) as a part-time lecturer in the Faculty of Educa-\ntion. He is working towards his first degree, having obtained a Cert. Ed. He is in\nhis late 30s.\n\u25cf Student 4: Is a teaching assistant working within a primary school, she is working\ntowards her first degree after obtaining her Cert. Ed. She is in her mid 50s.\n\u25cf Student 5: Is a primary school teacher specialising in ICT and has a first degree\n(B.Ed.). She is in her late 30s.\n\u25cf Student 6: Was a primary teacher and now works as a research assistant at the\nUniversity of Plymouth. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, two Masters degrees and a\npostgraduate teaching qualification, specialising in Geography. He is in his mid 30s.\nInfluence of online PBL on teachers 131\nIn order to answer the questions posed in this small-scale study and explore the issues\nof identity and professional practice, the results from each student will be summarised\nand presented.\nChanges in identity\nStudent 1, who had been a primary school teacher and now works in higher educa-\ntion, reported that his online identity was \u2018the same person as face to face\u2019.\nHowever, he detected that the group\u2019s online identity was subtly different to a real-\nlife, face-to-face student group. He acknowledged that although the group \u2018shared\nthe same problems, [went through] the same process, [and] were on the same\ncourse\u2019, he was unsure what actually prompted the identity of other group members,\nas for most of the module they were only encountered through electronic media\nsuch as the online discussion group. He was uncertain whether group identity online\nwas derived from \u2018the thoughts they put forward, the style of writing or the way\n[they] respond to messages\u2019. Although he was certain that his online identity was\nidentical to his real-life identity, he expressed uncertainty about the validity of the\nidentity of others.\nStudent 2, another male student who teaches in adult education, shared the opin-\nion of student 1 in that \u2018\u2026 online I am not usually different from my real persona\u2019.\nHe saw identity change as somewhat of a moral dilemma, stating that \u2018in a way it is\nlying if you take on a different persona\u2019. He admitted, however, that there were\noccasions in mediated environments when he modified his identity, most usually\nwhen he encountered \u2018someone who doesn\u2019t know me. I enjoy an argument. I will\nstart an argument. It is always an interesting situation\u2019. However, he conceded \u2018I\nwould do that in a real life situation as well though\u2019. This student presented a fairly\ndefined personal identity and sustained it throughout the duration of the module. His\nreal-life practice does not appear to have been acutely influenced by any identity\nchanges in the online environment.\nStudent 3, another male teacher working in higher education, was also of the opin-\nion that he changed little when in an online environment. He argued that online he\nwas \u2018\u2026 very much the same as I am face to face\u2019. He revealed that when he first expe-\nrienced the online world, he operated in a strictly formalised manner, and was careful\nto send emails and discussion group messages that were correctly punctuated with\nerrors corrected. He also reported that he typed his messages in a very formal style\nand that this reflected his real-life identity. He admitted, however, that there were \u2018all\nsorts of selves\u2019, depending on the different contexts of real life. This indicates that he\nwas carefully negotiating his way through a strictly self-imposed ZPD, where he\nensured that he carefully managed his impression. He commented that regardless of\nall the possible \u2018selves\u2019, \u2018I don\u2019t have a different identity online. I don\u2019t mask me. If\nthey read me online they will recognise me\u2019. Interestingly, there is an assumption\nwithin this statement that other online individuals would already \u2018know\u2019 him, which\nin online environments of course, is rarely the case. Regardless of this student\u2019s sense\nof continuation of identity, he remained on the periphery of the community of\n132 S. Wheeler et al.\npractice, and was reluctant to engage with others online. Instead, he preferred to\ncommunicate via the videoconference links with the rest of the group, where,\ncomfortable within his own ZPD, he was able to make several valuable contributions.\nStudent 4, a female teacher working in primary education, differed significantly in\nher views of online identity. She considered herself to be \u2018calmer, more reasonable\nand intelligent\u2019 than she was in real life. \u2018I used to let my frustration and need for\nspeed spill over\u2019, she reported, \u2018and this course has taught me it is not needed\u2019. In\ncontrast to Student 3, this student seemed to have been aided by the affordance of\nasynchronous online discussion, with its time to reflect and the slowly building\npermanence of the message archive seen as contributing toward a positive experience.\nShe claimed to have become \u2018better and more confident\u2019 as a result of the online\ndiscussion experience, yet also felt a little excluded from the learning community.\nInstead she stated that \u2018it was easier to tell myself I was interacting with a machine\nrather than with a group of people\u2019. This was evidenced by regular postings to the\nonline discussions, but less engagement in the videoconferenced discussions than\nher peers. Even though she reported the experience to be positive in terms of shaping\nher personal style, she nevertheless perceived a sense of alienation from the rest of the\ngroup and during synchronous interaction remained on the periphery of the commu-\nnity. It is not known what factors may have caused this, but we can speculate that\nstudent 4\u2019s personal ZPD could be located within the more anonymous text-based\ninteraction mode.\nStudent 5, another female teacher working in primary education, claimed that\nher identity was very similar online and in real life. However, she admitted that\nthere were times when she slipped between identities, confessing that \u2018I like to be\nseen as clever\u2019, but \u2018then I would be laughing and giggling and selling myself short\nto not be seen as clever.\u2019 Student 5 engaged with the videoconferenced discussion\nsessions and made many useful contributions, but tended to see her online contri-\nbutions as trivial. \u2018I was reading [my contributions] back on the discussion board\nand just cringing. Like so and so has a theory, and I\u2019ll go, I do agree \u2026 I seem to\nbe quite insubstantial \u2026\u2019. She also reported that she did not feel like a member of\nthe group, and that confusion of the identity of other students online helped\nto contribute to this alienation. For Student 5, progress was hampered due to lack\nof knowledge of the character of her community of practice, something she viewed\nas an artefact of the mediated environment. She thought that the online message\nboards actually thwarted discussion: \u2018There wasn\u2019t much engagement really. If you\nkind of answered every discussion board [topic], not everyone did, if you did five\ncomments, normally in a tutorial you would say more than five things.\u2019 She evalu-\nates the online discussion in terms of quantity due to the brevity of the actual\ncontributions, an indication that her preferred ZPD is located within a more imme-\ndiate and face-to-face mode of interaction where richer social cues might be more\nforthcoming.\nFinally, Student 6, a male primary teacher now working in higher education,\nrevealed some disparity between his online and real-life identities. He reported that\nhis online identity was \u2018secretive perhaps, nervous I think. Lacking self confidence\u2019.\nInfluence of online PBL on teachers 133\nHowever, when asked what kind of a teacher he was, he stated that he was \u2018\u2026 quite\noutgoing, humorous, observant \u2026\u2019. When asked about his study routine he said: \u2018I\nworked in isolation really\u2026\u2019, rarely discussing his progress with other module\nstudents. Student 6 enjoyed the online learning, but preferred discussion with his\npeers through the videoconference links. He said: \u2018I got much more sense of group\nthrough the videoconferencing. I hadn\u2019t done it before, and I was quite apprehensive\nand it was quite a strange feeling but I believe we got more of a sense of group\ndynamic than on the message board\u2019, and he later stated that he \u2018took an active role\nin the videoconferencing. It may have given me more of a feeling of being a part of a\ngroup. Made me more involved and may then have made a more prominent part\u2019. For\nstudent 6, a \u2018sense of group\u2019 was an important aspect of the learning process, moti-\nvating him to contribute, shaping his identity as a learner and providing a deeper and\nmore meaningful level of social support. Student 6\u2019s ZPD is located across all modes\nof interaction, enabling him to deeply participate as a member of his community of\npractice.\nFor almost all of the students in this small sample, online identity is reported to be\nsimilar or identical to real-life identity. However, as tutors we detected small changes\nin identity from some as the module progressed but can only speculate to what these\nchanges may be attributed. For example, when online there is evidence that students\nmay \u2018manage their impression\u2019 a little more formally than in real-life contexts, and\nthis may equally be the result of self-confidence or a lack of the same. Most reported\nthat the mediated learning experience helped them to reflect upon their own\nprofessional practice and for some may even have challenged their current practices.\nThis effect, however, may result more from the discussions and the PBL materials\nthan from the medium used to convey them.\nChanges in practice style\nAll the students reported changes in professional practice style as a result of the\nonline module. Student 1 reported that he now had a greater awareness of how to\nenable his pupils to interact with children in other countries. He reported that due to\nhis own experiences working with ill-structured problems, he now \u2018would like to give\nthem a chance to be in the system but look outside the system so they can change it\neventually to make it better\u2019. Student 1 therefore saw problem-based scenarios as\nempowering and liberating for learners, and was attempting to introduce them into\nhis own teaching.\nStudent 2 admitted that he was \u2018certainly not at the end of that change\u2019 in his\nprofessional development, but had formed the opinion that \u2018there are pros and cons\nto computer teaching, and I am a little but cynical. I see a huge danger that we could\nautomate learning and this could be negative\u2019. His views of computer-based learning\nhave become entrenched, as he has examined his own views and professional prac-\ntice, but he has emerged with a balanced perspective of the inherent benefits and\nlimitations of online learning and emphasises the value he places on student centred\nlearning.\n134 S. Wheeler et al.\nStudent 3 also valued student-centred approaches and modified his resource\ndevelopment as a result of his experiences on the module. He reported that \u2018Origi-\nnally my online resources tended to be informative and information based. Now I\nhave ideas of it being more student centred\u2019. When asked for a specific example of his\npractice style change Student 3 said that \u2018previously I would have explained to\nstudents in a theoretical way. It would have been very much how theorists see it. My\nidea is now more experienced based. I get the student to experience for themselves\nwhat it is like \u2026\u2019. This shift in values directly reflected Student 3\u2019s own engagement\nin PBL, and is a facet that he genuinely appeared to value. He reported that he now\ncreates more interactive materials that provide his students with choices and reflective\ntasks, to develop their thinking skills.\nStudent 4 reports she derived much personal satisfaction from her experience on\nthe module. Her self-confidence improved and she stated that \u2018I can do this, I have\nthe ability and I am hoping other people will see this happening and think \u201cshe can\ndo this, I can do this\u201d\u2019. She feels that her new found confidence can be imparted to\nher colleagues and that, in this way, the entire school will benefit and their computer-\nbased activities will be enhanced.\nA different aspect emerged for Student 5, who was inspired from the module to act\nas a change agent in her school. She reported that \u2018We have got two interactive white-\nboards at school and one has been put into a teacher\u2019s class who didn\u2019t really want it\nand no-one in the school wanted it \u2026\u2019. She goes on to describe her strategy for\nembedding the interactive whiteboards into everyday school use. Working with the\nheadteacher she has devised an induction programme: \u2018there is only 4 staff at school\nso I will spend time with each of them \u2026\u2019. She feels that her self-esteem has also been\nraised as a result of her experiences studying on the module and that this has\nbenefited her professionally: \u2018\u2026 so I gained self esteem, gained by having something\ndifferent and professionally it has changed me\u2019. Student 5 recounted a conversation\nwith her head teacher who was discussing strategies for improving ICT use in the\nschool: \u2018\u2026we must do something with laptops\u2019, she advised him, \u2018because research\nhas shown laptops make a big difference to teacher motivation. I thought\u2014I wouldn\u2019t\nhave known that before\u2019.\nFinally, student 6 who is in his first year of teaching in higher education, reported\nseveral major changes in his professional practice style as a result of the content of the\nonline module. When asked if there were any changes made in his teaching he said:\n\u2018Yes, a lot. I used a lot of the theoretical aspects. This has helped to underpin a lot of\nthe courses I have to run\u2019. Two of the courses Student 6 was teaching on were new\nto him, but he has reported that some of the theoretical aspects of the module have\nbeen invaluable in helping him to conceptualise delivery of new courses in initial\nteacher training.\nStudent evaluations of MTutor\nDuring the interviews with the six students, interesting information emerged regard-\ning their evaluation of and satisfaction with their online learning experience. For some,\nInfluence of online PBL on teachers 135\nflexibility was an important affordance of the online PBL. For example, Student 6\nsuggested that \u2018it was useful being able to turn the computer on and read something\nfor twenty minutes or so\u2019. Student 5 concurred that flexibility was an important facet\nof the module\u2019s success, \u2018in that you kind of had the flexibility of the computer\ncombined with being able to get to know [the tutor] in the flesh\u2019. The blended mode\nof delivery was seen to be powerful by others, as according to Student 2 \u2018the purpose\nof the communication will affect the means you use\u2019. Face-to-face, videoconference\nand online discussion, he reported, \u2018are all means of communication. If you need to\nspeak to someone quickly you pick up the telephone \u2026 You use e-mail to ask a\nquestion generally \u2026 if you want to discuss a problem you go and speak face to face\u2019.\nNotwithstanding, for most of the students, once the novelty value and anxiety\neffects had been overcome, the synchronous nature of videoconferencing was\npreferred to the online discussion group as a means of comparison, debate and collab-\noration. Online message boards have a permanency, as well as the time-shifted effect\nof imposing a waiting time for responses, and this may for some have inhibited fuller\nparticipation within the community of practice. Moreover, a group of six students\nmay not offer a critical mass of group dynamic required for meaningful discussion\nwithin electronic environments of this kind. It is possible that small groups may be\nbetter served with synchronous discussion such as videoconferencing, while larger\ngroups may gain a more meaningful learning experience through asynchronous\nmedia, as contributions can be made in a more equitable setting. Managed learning\nenvironment designers should therefore consider whether the choice of technology\nwill be a help or a hindrance to good learning outcomes (Wheeler, 2000).\nConclusions\nWe could claim that changes in practice style were a direct result of engagement with\nonline PBL but this would be contentious, because it is impossible to state whether\nchanges would have occurred anyway, regardless of each student\u2019s participation on\nthe module. Furthermore, we do not know whether online learning, or the problem-\nbased elements, or some other factor has influenced changes in practice. However,\nthere is evidence that the online students found the PBL content of the module to be\ndeeply engaging and one that challenged their own professional practice styles. They\nbecame convinced that they could use the same problem-based methods to support\ntheir own students. Some also considered this to be a move closer to student-centred\nteaching.\nStudents were very positive about the way in which course materials were presented\nonline using PBL, but some criticised the nature of the online discussion, claiming\nthat it prohibited rather than liberated discussion. We can speculate that several\nfactors may have influenced this outcome, including lack of familiarity or confidence\nof use, the permanency of the message archive (students not able to retract what they\nhad written once it was posted), asynchronous aspects such as the need to wait for\nresponses, and a time disparity of use due to the quicker students reaching the\nmessage board long before the slower students. All of these factors should be\n136 S. Wheeler et al.\nconsidered by those who wish to build asynchronous discussion facilities into the\ndesign of managed learning environments.\nIt is not possible to evaluate how any other presentation of the same content may\nhave been received, as this was not a comparative study. However, some students\nreported that their confidence was boosted\u2014an affective outcome that positively\ninfluenced their professional practice\u2014which may have arisen from the extended\ntime they had spent negotiating meaning within their small online community of\npractice.\nBaron and Misovich\u2019s notion of a group-mediated \u2018zone of proximal change\u2019 may\nhave been in evidence, particularly during the videoconference sessions. Students\nreported that they gained more by debating the problems using the visual medium\nthan they did through online text-based discussion, a phenomenon evidenced by the\nreticence of some to engage in meaningful discussion through the message board.\nThis raises questions over the efficacy of asynchronous technologies to mediate\ndialogue for small groups.\nIt is difficult to claim causal links between online identity and professional prac-\ntice in the \u2018real world\u2019 due to the small-scale qualitative nature of this study. A\nmore quantitative, larger scale study would be required to enable us to establish\nany causal evidence. Yet this small-scale study has served to highlight some inter-\nesting features of online PBL and the nature of online communities of practice.\nTeachers tend to become convinced of the efficacy of the higher cognitive level of\nengagement PBL yields, and often change their style to accommodate it into their\nown professional practice. Furthermore, mature, full-time professionals prefer the\nflexibility that online learning affords, often in spite of the many accompanying\nproblems and issues.\nFinally, it is worth acknowledging that while distributed PBL is a reworking of\nestablished case-based learning, it is as yet a nascent online method, mediated by\ntechnologies that are still unfamiliar to many. As has already been indicated, the\nopportunity exists to further examine the effectiveness of online or distributed PBL;\nits place specifically in postgraduate studies and generally within the practice of\ndistance education.\nReferences\nAhlberg, M., Kaasinen, A., Kaivola, T. & Houtsonen, L.
