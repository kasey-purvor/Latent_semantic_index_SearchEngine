The evidence that democracy promotes\nprosperity is neither strong nor robust. More-\nover, which aspects of policy making and hu-\nman well-being are promoted by democracies is\nstill a subject of debate.1\nEven if correlations between democracy and\noutcome measures can be found, there is an\noverriding difficulty of interpreting them as\ncausal effects. Whether democracy matters, per\nse, or simply serves as a proxy for societal and\npolitical development presents a difficult prob-\nlem for research in this area. Thinkers such as\nSeymour Martin Lipset (1959) have argued that\ndemocracy can thrive only when conditions are\nright. If this is correct, then becoming demo-\ncratic may serve only as a proxy for these hard-\nto-measure cultural and societal preconditions.\nThis paper explores these issues further by\nreconsidering the link between democracy and\nhealth using panel data from a cross section of\ncountries. The data show a strong (conditional)\ncorrelation between life expectancy and democ-\nracy. This relationship is robust to controlling\nfor the initial level of human capital as well as\npolitical histories. The data also suggest that\nhealth policy interventions are superior in\ndemocracies.\nI. Background\nHuman history has witnessed remarkable in-\ncreases in life expectancy alongside increases in\nprosperity. Samuel H. Preston (1975) showed\nthat this relationship is nonlinear, with the larg-\nest gains in life expectancy being associated\nwith increases in income per capita at low in-\ncomes. These increases in life expectancy can\nbe traced to three factors, all of which are as-\nsociated with increases in prosperity, although\nthe direction of causation is hard to establish.2\nFirst, there are reductions in malnutrition and\nimprovements in infrastructure such as clean\nwater supply and improved sanitation facilities.\nSecond, and very important in recent history,\nthere is medical intervention through control\n(due to immunization and insecticides) and\ntreatment of infectious diseases using antibiot-\nics (see, for example, Davidson Gwatkin,\n1980). Third, there are improvements in knowl-\nedge and lifestyle. Angus S. Deaton (2004,\np.109) notes that \u201chealth improvement ulti-\nmately came from the globalization of knowl-\nedge, facilitated by local political, economic,\nand educational conditions.\u201d The literature to\ndate has focused more on the latter influences\n(education and economics) rather than the po-\nlitical foundations of increased life expectancy.\nThere are three main theoretical differences\nbetween democracies and autocracies that we\nmight expect to influence health issues. The first\nconcerns representation. Daron Acemoglu and\nJames Robinson (2005) focus on who controls\npolitical office, modeling autocracy as a dicta-\ntorship of the rich and democracy as a dictator-\nship of the poor or middle classes. In this view,\nhealth indicators will improve if public health is\n\u2020 Discussants: Antonio Merlo, University of Pennsylva-\nnia; Benjamin Olken, Harvard University; Nathan Nunn,\nUniversity of British Columbia.\n* Besley: Department of Economics and STICERD,\nLondon School of Economics, Houghton Street, London,\nWC2A 2AE (e-mail: t.besley@lse.ac.uk); Kudamatsu: De-\npartment of Economics and STICERD, London School of\nEconomics, Houghton Street, London, WC2A 2AE (e-mail:\nm.kudamatsu@lse.ac.uk).

An effect on\nhealth seems plausible in this view, to the extent\nthat the rich have less interest in public solu-\ntions to health problems.\nA second view of the difference between\ndemocracy and autocracy emphasizes account-\nability structures. Democracies demand ac-\ncountability to a broad set of citizens at regular\nintervals, whereas autocrats are accountable\nonly to a smaller group such as the military.\nMoreover, autocrats typically repress political\nopposition and the media to stifle public policy\ndebate. This view also predicts that greater at-\ntention will be paid to health issues in democ-\nracies since failure to do so should result in\nleaders being removed from office\u2014this link\nbeing weaker in autocracies.\nA third difference between democracies and\nautocracies concerns the process of political\nselection, with democracies having stronger\nmechanisms for selecting competent and honest\nleaders to implement policy. To the extent that\nhealth interventions are supported by skilled\nand incorruptible political leaders, democracies\nshould lead to better health outcomes than\nautocracies.\nThere are conflicting views about whether\ndemocracy affects policy and economic perfor-\nmance. Adam Przeworski and Fernando Li-\nmongi (1993) review empirical research on the\neffect of democracy on economic growth, con-\ncluding that the correlation is weak and not\nrobust. Torsten Persson and Guido Tabellini\n(2005) try a novel econometric approach, find-\ning some support for the proposition that persis-\ntent democracy is associated with improvements\nin economic performance.\nThere is a small literature that looks at the\nrelationship between life expectancy and de-\nmocracy in cross-country data. Alvaro Franco et\nal. (2004) report a positive correlation between\nlife expectancy and democracy (see also\nRamesh Govindaraj and Ravindra Rannan-\nEliya, 1994). David A. Lake and Matthew A.\nBaum (2001) relate democracy to a variety of\npublic health interventions.\nII. Evidence\nWe use panel data across countries from the\n1960s to the 2000s. We begin by showing there\nis a strong and robust correlation between life\nexpectancy at birth and democracy after con-\ntrolling for income. Our basic specification uses\ndata for every fifth year between 1962 and\n2002. We estimate an equation of the form:\n(1) hsrt \u0001 \u0002r \u0003 \u0004t \u0003 \u00051 dsrt \u0003 \u00052 Dsrt \u0003 \u00061 ysrt\n\u0003 \u00062 \u0001ysrt \u00022 \u0003 x\u0001sr\u0001\u0003 \u0007srt\nwhere hsrt is some health indicator in country s,\nin region r, and in year t; \u0002r is a region dummy\nvariable; \u0004t is a year dummy variable; ysrt is\nincome per capita in country s, in region r,\naveraged over years t \u0003 4 to t; and xsr is other\ntime invariant exogenous variables such as legal\norigins and political history. The variables (dsrt,\nDsrt) are measures of democracy.3 The first is a\ncontemporaneous measure denoting the fraction\nof democratic years between year t \u0003 4 and t,\nwhile Dsrt is a longer-term one denoting the\nfraction of democratic years since 1956, until\nyear t.4 The variable \u0007srt is an error for which\nwe compute robust standard errors clustered at\nthe country level. The main concern in interpret-\ning results stems from the possibility that, as ar-\ngued by Lipset (1959), there are social and\ncultural factors that evolve and make it easier for\ndemocratic institutions to be supported. If such\nfactors exist, then we would spuriously attribute a\ndirect effect of democracy on outcomes.\nTable 1 presents the basic results. In column\n1, we look solely at the partial relationship with\ncontemporaneous democracy, finding that being\ndemocratic is associated with a 3.5-year in-\ncrease in life expectancy. In column 2, we add\nincome per capita measures. After controlling\nfor income, the democracy effect falls to around\ntwo years, but remains positive and significant.\nColumn 3 adds the fraction of democratic years\nsince 1956. The data suggest that it is more\npermanent democratic transitions that matter\nand the contemporaneous democracy effect is\nno longer significant, although an F-test indi-\ncates that the two democracy variables are\njointly significant. The point estimate suggests\nthat a country that has been democratic for the\nwhole period, from 1956 through year t, has a\n3 A country year is defined as democratic if variable\nPOLITY2 from the POLITY IV database is positive.\n4 Philip Keefer (2005) and Persson and Tabellini (2005)\nargue that longer-lived democratic experience is important.\n314 AEA PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS MAY 2006\nlife expectancy that is more than five years\nhigher than a country that has been autocratic\nsince 1956. To put this in perspective, this point\nestimate \u201cexplains\u201d 3.5 of the 13.7-year life\nexpectancy difference between Ghana (demo-\ncratic for 11 out of 47 years) and the United\nStates (always democratic) in 2002. In column\n4, we report the results from regressing infant\nmortality on the same set of regressors as in\ncolumn 3. This shows countries that have been\ndemocratic since 1956 have fewer infants dying\nbefore reaching the age of one, by about 17 per\n1,000 live births (about one-fourth of the sam-\nple mean), than countries that have been con-\ntinuously autocratic since 1956.\nTable 2 looks at the possibility that democ-\nracy is correlated with existing values and,\nhence, not picking up an institutional effect. In\ncolumn 1, we include country fixed effects. In\nthis case, the democracy effect is no longer\npresent. It could be symptomatic of some omit-\nted common factor driving both democracy and\nlife expectancy. In column 2, we confine the\nwithin-country analysis to a balanced panel of\n21 countries that have made a consolidated\ndemocratic transition in the period that we look\nat, i.e., a single switch to democracy, which is\nmaintained until 2002. For this subgroup of\ncountries, the significant democracy effect re-\nmains and is larger (by two years) than the\neffect seen in Table 1, column 3. Table 2, col-\numn 3, returns to the basic specification studied\nin Table 1 and adds measures of political history\nas controls. Specifically, it includes the fraction of\nyears between 1900 and 1955 for which the coun-\ntry was democratic, and the fraction of years in the\nsame period for which the country was a colony.\nNeither of these is significant, although the effect\nof democratic years since 1956 remains.\nColumn 4 controls for the stock of education\nin the population above 15 years of age in 1960,\nusing data from Robert Barro and Jong-Wha\nLee (2001). Prerequisites for democracy are\nlikely to be correlated with human capital, and\nEdward L. Glaeser et al.

Conclusion\nOur results suggest that there is a robust\ncorrelation between democratic institutions and\nhealth, resulting in greater life expectancy in\ndemocracies. The fact that these results are ro-\nbust to including education and political history\nas regressors, or including country fixed effects\nin a sample of countries that made a consoli-\ndated transition to democracy during our sam-\nple period, is encouraging to the view that\npolitical institutions matter.\nThe results contribute to a growing body of\nthe literature that takes political economy\nfactors seriously in understanding human\nwell-being. The challenge now is to take this\nagenda beyond broad cross-country compari-\nsons and into the detailed workings of political\nand bureaucratic behavior under different sys-\ntems of government.\nREFERENCES\nAcemoglu, Daron and Johnson, Simon. \u201cDisease\nand Development: The Effect of Life Expect-\nancy on Economic Growth.\u201d Unpublished\nPaper, 2005.\nAcemoglu, Daron and Robinson, James A.
