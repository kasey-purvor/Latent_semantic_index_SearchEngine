Biomedical measures and questionnaires on psychological characteristics were collected within 4 weeks of diagnosis.\\ud\nResults:  Of 1109 participants referred, 824 consented to participate (74.3%). Mean (\u00b1 SD) age was 59.5 \u00b1 12 years and 54.9% were male. Mean HbA1c was 8.1 \u00b1 2.1% and did not differ by gender. Mean body mass index (BMI) was significantly higher in women (33.7 vs. 31.3 kg\/m2; P < 0.001); 69% of women and 54% of men were obese (BMI > 30 kg\/m2). Total cholesterol was significantly higher in women (5.6 vs. 5.2 mmol\/l; P < 0.001). Overall, 14.7% reported smoking. Percentages reporting recommended levels of vigorous activity (\u2265 3 times\/week) and moderate activity (\u2265 5 times\/week) were 10.6 and 16.0%, respectively, and were lower in women.
