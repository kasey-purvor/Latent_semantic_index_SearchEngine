If, as Richard \nBailey suggests, early Quakerism was a \u2018thaumaturgical (signs and wonders) movement\u20192 then \nsigns such as Nayler\u2019s, whether the result of \u2018celestial inhabitation christology\u2019, the \u2018flesh and \nbone\u2019 presence of Christ in the believer3 or, as Leo Damrosch claims, \u2018a single symbolic act \ncondensing a number of competing Quaker beliefs\u20194, were to be expected, if not easily \nexplained. Although, as Richard Vann asserts, \u2018beliefs of Quakers are almost uniquely hostile to \nhistory\u20195 and early Quakers aligned history with superfluous tradition, detrimental to true \n \n 2 \nappreciation of the inward voice of God, by the early eighteenth century the first Quaker \nhistories had appeared. Analysis of such works, and those barred from republication, \ndemonstrates how eighteenth-century Friends tried to change the identity of Quakerism, \nincluding that of individuals, by rewriting history.  \n \nNayler\u2019s behaviour and subsequent punishment for blasphemy have been interpreted as evidence \nof \u2018the ever-recurring tension between idea and power...liberty and authority\u20196 and led to \nincreased persecution of Friends, who gradually renounced much of their enthusiastic behaviour. \nScholars of Quakerism have debated the extent, though, to which Friends renounced \u2018godly \nradicalism\u2019, as Catie Gill describes it, and withdrew from the \u2018world\u2019.7 Leo Damrosch and \nAdrian Davies, for example, have considered the theological and social shift in Quakerism to be \none from radical millenarianism in the 1650s to late seventeenth- and eighteenth-century \nrespectability.8 Bailey has dated their withdrawal as beginning shortly after the Nayler dispute.9 \nWilliam C. Braithwaite also described, almost a century earlier, the \u2018worthy and drab \nrespectability\u2019 personified by Friends such as George Whitehead, who was most active and \ninfluential in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century.10 Michele Lise Tarter too has \ncommented both upon the rejection, from the 1670s, of women\u2019s mystical writings, and the \nexpectation that writers be \u2018still and quiet\u2019, in contrast to the earliest years of Quakerism. She \nconcurs with Luella Wright that this led to an eighteenth-century period of literary \n\u2018barrenness\u2019.11 That is not to suggest that all scholars of Quakerism view the late seventeenth \nand eighteenth centuries as a period of quietism. Referring particularly to the tithe testimony, \nNicholas Morgan has asserted that a \u2018sense of outward mission\u2019 continued until the 1730s. He \nrejects the idea that eighteenth-century Friends resigned from \u2018the early Quaker wish to convert \nthe world\u2019 and suggests that they \u2018refused the acceptance of standards which compromised the \n \n 3 \nprecepts of their earliest co-religionists.\u201912 However, in the case of contentious early works, \neighteenth-century Friends were willing to compromise in cases such as Nayler\u2019s to secure their \nfuture. Described by Whitehead in 1716 as being amongst those who had \u2018crucified to \nthemselves the Lord of Life afresh, and put him to open Shame and Reproach\u201913 Nayler was \neventually accepted back into the fold, and A Collection of Sundry Books, Epistles and Papers \nwas published in the early eighteenth century, although censored by the editor Whitehead, and \nothers. The twenty-three excluded works were not silently left out. Instead, they were listed as \n\u2018His Controversial Books not Reprinted in this Collection, in the Years, 1655 and 1656.\u201914  \n \nThe silencing of radicalism was in part achieved by the Second Day Morning Meeting, one of \nseveral London meetings established in the decades following the Restoration, as well as the \nregular meetings for worship and business organised in each county. Central meetings were \nactive in shaping the collections of Quaker records and the Second Day Meeting in particular, \nfounded by the Quaker leader George Fox in 1673 to consider works for publication, was \nbelieved by critics within the Society to suppress individual inspiration whilst favouring \nuniformity and avoiding of controversy.15 Although Thomas O\u2019Malley has considered its role \nbefore the Toleration Act, and Sheila Wright has addressed its influence in the later eighteenth \ncentury,16 there has been little consideration of the Meeting\u2019s activities in the intervening period \naside from Tarter\u2019s brief comments on the rejection of prophetic writings, often by women, as \n\u2018not mete to print\u201917 and Bailey\u2019s comments on its efforts to transform the Quaker Christ into an \ninward, mystical figure.18 However, as Kate Peters suggests, much information about the earliest \nFriends is \u2018directly attributable to the efforts of a later generation of Quakers\u2019 keen to prevent \n\u2018the publication of enthusiastic or politically dangerous works\u2019.19 As the emerging sectarian \nidentity of Quakerism during the 1650s was only \u2018in the process of being formed\u201920, later Friends \n \n 4 \nhad to remould this fluid earlier identity, adding to their unwillingness to address the issue. \nFurther, after Nayler\u2019s trial several anti-Quaker writers had produced \u2018histories\u2019 of the Friends, \nemphasising his conviction for blasphemy. These included William Grigge\u2019s The Quaker\u2019s Jesus \nof 1658 and Richard Blome\u2019s Fanatick History of 1660.21 Grigge described Quakers as \u2018deluded \nand seduced Souls\u2019 led astray by Fox and Nayler.22 Blome, although claiming to consider all \ntypes of \u2018fanaticism\u2019, used the Nayler episode to depict English Quakerism. In response, Nayler \nblamed \u2018the many cruel Spirits, who pursued my Soul unto death\u2019.23 However, despite his \nprotestations, anti-Quaker works from the mid-seventeenth century were still used, and in some \ncases disseminated overseas, during the later seventeenth and eighteenth century. These included \nthe German version of Blome\u2019s work, published in 1701.24 It is perhaps not surprising, then, that \nin 1677 the Meeting agreed that the proposed volume of Nayler\u2019s collected works \u2018be suspended \ntill it be taken into further & more generall Consideration by the 2d dayes meeting\u2019.25 Some \nhistorians have suggested that Fox actively blocked the project.26 It was only mentioned again in \n1698, when a letter from Thomas Hammond of York about Nayler\u2019s works was acknowledged, \nand George Bowles was \u2018desired to get JNs Recantation.\u201927 Two months later Bowles brought \nthis, and John Whiting provided a list of Nayler\u2019s works. The business relating to Nayler\u2019s books \ncontinued in a similar fashion until 1700, when the Meeting declared that if the Yearly Meeting \ninsisted on publication, \u2018something by way of Advertizement should be writt to cleare Fri[en]ds \nand Truth from the Reproach yt came by him.\u201928 The proposal was only renewed in 1710, after \npressure from some Friends earnest to print his works \u2018either with or without this Meet[ing]s \nApprobation.\u201929 It was then agreed that the relevant minutes, spanning more than thirty years, be \nproduced for inspection. Nayler\u2019s works were also to be gathered together and considered \nalongside \u2018letters and Testimonys of Friends as tend to clear Truth and Friends from ye offence \ngiven by him and his followers when Clouded.\u201930 The Meeting agreed to include works \n \n 5 \nconsidered \u2018propper and safe\u2019, and in one case passages safe to be abstracted.31 As Tarter \nsuggests, such amendments formed part of a \u2018wave of censorship and controlled historiography\u2019 \naiming to \u2018eradicate all traces of enthusiasm\u2019.32 By 1712 Thomas Raylton had examined which \nworks had been read and approved, and which were still unread. In 1714 approval was finally \ngiven for publication, \u2018when Opportunity presents\u2019.33 It did not for another two years.  \n \nAs part of his attempt to understand what Nayler thought that he was doing34 Damrosch has \nidentified the need for historians of seventeenth-century Quakerism to be aware of silent \nalterations to those works included in the eighteenth-century collection of Nayler\u2019s works before \nthey were considered fit to be republished. Damrosch is by no means the first scholar to identify \nsuch changes; Braithwaite too comments on the amendments made to Robert Barclay\u2019s Apology \nfor the True Christian Divinity (1678 [1676]) when it was translated from Latin, describing the \nEnglish version as \u2018carefully revised.\u201935 David J. Hall has concluded that Friends believed that \nthe first edition of a work was not necessarily the most true, and edited passages accordingly.36 \nHowever, more significantly, Damrosch has not considered the content of works which were not \nrepublished; or the extent to which the translation of key Quaker works affected the version of \nQuaker history available, and the conclusions of modern scholars. Although, as he asserts, \namendments were made to the Collection, other works were excluded by those seeking to redeem \nan infamous figure. Their reasons for doing so and the ways in which they represented Nayler are \ninterlinked, and served to rehabilitate a contentious figure from the Quaker past. \n \nMany of the works reprinted had originally been planned to coincide with Nayler\u2019s ministry, as \npolemical tools.37 As Hilary Hinds has recently asserted, \u2018the Quaker travelling ministry was \nalso a publishing ministry.\u201938 Unsurprisingly, then, some of the alterations made to the included \n \n 6 \nworks bear out Whitehead\u2019s claim that Nayler\u2019s original language needed to be changed for a \nlater audience. Whitehead appealed to the charity of the eighteenth-century reader, to \u2018make the \nbest or most favourable Construction...with Respect to the general Import of the Matters and \nThings in those most clear and evident Truths aym\u2019d at.\u201939 Nayler was accepted to have aimed at \nclear truths; however, it was up to the reader to discern them. Thus, for reasons of clarity, the \nword \u2018letter\u2019 was replaced by \u2018the Scriptures\u2019 in the 1716 version of Milk for Babes.40 Other \nchanges, though, were more fundamental. Damrosch has identified significant alterations which \nreflect changes in Quaker theology and in their self-representation.41 In the same work, first \npublished posthumously in 1661, the concluding \u2018psalm\u2019, \u2018of James, the servant of Jesus...even \nhow the Lord was with him when he was beset with darkness, and assaulted with strong \ntemptation\u2019 is entirely absent.42 Whitehead\u2019s introduction and Nayler\u2019s official recantation were \nto be the only references to his downfall in the volume. Another work originally stated that \n\u2018Christ never believed that he could never be perfect\u2019, but this was changed to \u2018it is not the faith \nof Christ to believe that men could never be perfect\u2019. Damrosch believes that the first version \nrepresents Nayler\u2019s belief that the divine element in Jesus the man brought him to perfection, as \nit continued to do in the saints.43 His identification with Christ, when acted out, formed the crux \nof blasphemy charges against Friends and is considered shortly. The Meeting also took \nadvantage of the republication of Nayler\u2019s works to address issues relevant to the eighteenth-\ncentury reader. Love to the Lost, first published in 1656, was amended to include a passage \ncondemning fashions, customs, \u2018Feasting, and Riotings, Sports and vain Pleasures\u2019.44 The \nrelationship of God and his creation was also inverted to be more acceptable; instead of the \ncreature expecting to be \u2018wel-pleased with his Maker\u2019 the creature became \u2018well-pleasing to his \nMaker.\u201945 Caution was key to Friends\u2019 assertions; editors reading Nayler\u2019s \u2018yet doth the Sons of \nGod know the Incorruptible body that shall never wax old\u2019 replaced \u2018know\u2019 with \u2018believe, and in \n \n 7 \nmeasure understand.\u201946\n \nThe \u2018controversial books\u2019 often included first-generation beliefs unacceptable to eighteenth-\ncentury Quakerism. These included Nayler\u2019s opinions on subjects as varied as mendicant \npreaching, other denominations, honour and witchcraft. For example, A Dispute between James \nNayler and the Parish Teachers of Chesterfield (1655) called for all Friends to follow the will of \nGod, \u2018leave all and follow him as wanderers...deny our selves, and worldly Interest\u2019.47 This \nposed obvious logistical problems to the later organisation. Vagrants were condemned under the \n1601 vagrancy laws, and by the 1680s Friends had to be reminded that \u2018sins of Sodom\u2019 included \n\u2018contempt of the poor\u2019.48 What might be viewed by non-Quakers as disorderly rambling was now \n unacceptable to a group individually respected in the community and no longer evangelical but \necumenical in most of their sentiments.49 Controversy might also have arisen from Something \nfurther in answer to John Jackson\u2019s book (1655) which claimed that non-Quakers \u2018live in pride, \noppression and deceipt, [and] gets their words once a weeke\u2019. Nayler\u2019s direction that instead they \nshould \u2018read Christ...a gazing-stock where ever he comes in flesh...we rejoyce to be counted \nworthy to suffer with him\u201950 is similarly contentious. In one passage alone Nayler condemned \nnon-Quakers, and claimed that Friends were experiencing sufferings comparable to those of \nJesus. The following year Nayler again compared Christ\u2019s experience of persecution by \u2018Priests \nand people, that lived in pride and fulnesse\u2019 to that of \u2018these who follow him...at this day\u2019.51 \nAlthough Fox frequently represented himself as suffering in a Christlike way, with perhaps more \nbasis in early Quaker Christopresent theology than later orthodoxy admitted,52 Nayler\u2019s entry \ninto Bristol in imitation of Christ made such comparisons inherently dangerous for later Friends. \n \nAnother subject of the \u2018controversial\u2019 tracts, Nayler\u2019s criticism of other Interregnum churches, \n \n 8 \nexhibited the greatest variety of forms. Claiming in one work that the only churchgoers left were \n\u2018prophane persons, swearers, oppressors, drunkards and fighters,\u201953 he also attacked the \nhierarchy of the institution, the falsity, perversity or even diabolic nature of hireling teachers, and \ntheir failure to reform themselves satisfactorily. All of these criticisms, especially those claiming \nthat clergy were in league with the Devil, were highly inflammatory from the Restoration \nonwards, when Friends wanted to maintain their good name in wider society, and not condemn \nothers as Satan\u2019s agents or pagans. Penney similarly concludes that the probable reason for the \nomission of part of Fox\u2019s Journal, including comments on Baptists, was a \u2018desire to avoid \noffence\u2019 although disputations between the groups continued in print and occasionally in \npublic.54 Indeed, the passing of the 1662 Act to prevent printing of seditious literature may have \nadded to Friends\u2019 fears of persecution; those of the following years were often produced \nunderground as \u2018sedition\u2019 could be interpreted to include works deviating from mainstream \nreligious belief.55 Given Nayler\u2019s conviction for blasphemy, such works were perhaps too \ndangerous to reprint. \n \nSeventeenth- and eighteenth-century Quakers, both women and men, were also regularly \nexhorted to be honourable in business and modest in appearance. Honour was central to Friends\u2019 \nrelations with each other and appearance to the outside world. The honour of the world required, \nfor example, \u2018hat honour\u2019, a man\u2019s removal of his hat upon meeting a social superior; Quakers \nincluding William Penn condemned such behaviour as superfluous and transient, contrasting it \nwith true, permanent honour, which lay in \u2018the right ordering of mens Affections and Actions\u2019.56 \nNayler\u2019s comments consider the honour of the world, the \u2018Spirit of Pride and Flattery\u201957 Friends \ndespised; and that of God which Quakers, as God\u2019s people, sought to maintain through \nimpeccable behaviour. In The Railer Rebuked he actively criticised worldly honour, condemning \n \n 9 \nthose practising it as \u2018honouring thou knowst not what with the proud cloathing, and the gold \nring...this is not in the Lord, but in the earth\u2019. He continued, defining divine honour as \u2018that \npower which is of God, to whom ever he hath placed it without respect of persons\u2019. Friends were \nto give \u2018honour to whom honour is due, But no place for pride, nor the prince of pride.\u201958 \nElsewhere, Nayler asserted that carnal honour was embodied in the world\u2019s oppression of the \nFriends, \u2018a people, which by thy own words are so contemptible\u2019. He concluded that this was \nbecause of \u2018something in the bottom of greater price...else why should you gather thus from all \nquarters?\u201959 Nayler\u2019s expression of his views on honour was part of what Peters has described as \n\u2018a peculiar \u201cQuaker style\u201d\u2019 of the 1650s.60 His use of bitter polemic contrasted with the \npoliteness of conduct books written by non-Quaker authors and dealing with ostensibly similar \nissues. Although later Quakers discussed similar topics, their arguments were less rancorous. The \nlater seventeenth century saw a move from vindictive doctrinal debate towards \u2018polite \nreligion\u2019,61 although for Friends this change began after the Restoration, when enthusiastic \nassertions of infallibility needed to be quashed for the Society to survive. In this respect, \nNayler\u2019s mode of expression, rather than the content, was contentious, and his ideas reappear in \nlater works. In No Cross, No Crown of 1669 Penn reasserted Nayler\u2019s rejection of \u2018vain Apparel\u2019 \nalongside other examples of money and time-wasting, including \u2018Rich Furnitures\u2019 and \u2018vain and \nunnecessary Visits\u2019.62 He extended Nayler\u2019s arguments against pride in clothing with the \nscripturally-based assertion that pleasure in apparel was \u2018impudently shameless\u2019 as the first \ngarments after the Fall were worn with a sense of shame brought on by sin.63 In some ways \nNayler and Penn represent contrasting figures of Quaker manhood. Whilst Nayler\u2019s disorderly \nbehaviour led to his trial for blasphemy, Penn, the son of an admiral, typified respectable post-\nRestoration Quaker manhood, so his development of these themes arguably made Nayler\u2019s \ncomments superfluous. \n \n 10 \n \nFinally, although Fox considered witchcraft in his Journal, and Nayler treated it as a known \nphenomenon, stating that \u2018to fore-tell things to come without the Spirit of God is witchery\u201964, by \nthe early eighteenth century it was unlikely that Friends would be accused of witchcraft, rather \nthan schism, heresy or obstinacy. In the 1650s Friends\u2019 own prophesies led to accusations of  \nwitchcraft, and in response Nayler asserted that his enemies had conspired to convince people \nthat Friends \u2018are wizards, because we wil not bow downe to mens person\u2019.65 However, by 1716 \nbewitching was no longer a legitimate explanation for the events in Bristol, although Nayler\u2019s \nbehaviour had been originally attributed to the witchcraft of one of his female followers, Martha \nSimmonds.66 Thus Whitehead asserted that \u2018Martha fell into a Passion in a kind of Mourning... \nwhich so entered and pierced poor James Nayler, that it smote him down in so much Sorrow... \nFears and Doubting then entered him, that he came to be clouded in his Understanding, \nbewildred, and at a loss in his Judgment.\u201967 Whitehead\u2019s explanation is complex and to some \nextent sensitive to the penitent Nayler depicted through the works selected for publication. \nAlthough the women around Nayler were still blamed, something which Christine Trevett \namongst others has seen as an overemphasis,68 the element of witchcraft had been erased. The \nexplanation instead refers to a spiritual crisis brought on by Nayler\u2019s sensitivity to the feelings of \nothers and his naivety in allowing himself to be glorified. His struggle was against the Devil, the \n\u2018subtil Adversary\u2019, who was blamed for the division amongst Friends at the time. The Devil, \nthough, did not take the physical form of non-Quakers, or even \u2018turbulous\u2019 women, but was an \ninternal state which only Nayler could fight against to reappear, contrite and humbled. The \nrepresentation of Nayler\u2019s downfall had moved into abstract spiritual and mental realms: rather \nthan as a priest, the Devil appeared as doubt and discord amongst the faithful. Nayler was \ncarefully depicted by Whitehead as being far from Christlike, rather as all too human, an \n \n 11 \n\u2018everyman\u2019 figure of the suffering Quaker.69 Instead of radical manhood, which gave ear to \ndisorderly women, he was reinvented in the mould of eighteenth-century quietism. Through this \nrepresentation Whitehead could justify, to the Quaker editorial board, and to a readership, that \ninsight and even guidance might be gained from the works of the penitent blasphemer. \nBailey, in his study of the process of silencing early Quaker radicalism, considers how the group \nwhich had accepted themselves as a divinised part of God\u2019s nobility later considered this belief \nto be detrimental to the movement and expunged evidence of it from records within Fox\u2019s \nlifetime and with his acceptance, if not his blessing.70 He confirms Penney\u2019s belief that a \nminority of changes made before the publication of Fox\u2019s Journal were substantive, and \ninterprets this as a deliberate attempt to downplay Fox\u2019s earlier \u2018avatar\u2019 status.71 These had \nincluded \u2018laudatory\u2019 personal references to Fox72 and his likening of his sufferings at the hands \nof clergy, when awaiting trial for blasphemy, to those of Christ.73 A renewed emphasis was also \nplaced on the spirit of the apostles, perhaps as a more cautious way of confirming the continuous \nexperience of Pentecost for the believer.74 Penn\u2019s character sketch of Fox in the preface to his \nJournal therefore emphasized similarities between Fox\u2019s experiences and those of the early \nChristians: \u2018this man of God had his share of suffering\u2019, yet \u2018like his blessed Master, he was a \nservant to all\u2019.75 However, although Nayler was re-integrated into the revised Quakerism after \nsimilar remoulding, some of his followers remained outcasts because they refused to accept the \nalterations. Robert Rich, a self-declared disciple, who licked Nayler\u2019s wounds after his branding \nfor blasphemy, continued to blame Fox for divisions amongst Friends, and represented Nayler as \na Christlike figure taking on the sins of the world to redeem humanity: \u2018J.N. took all the blame \non himself, and made himself of no reputation...a true Israelite indeed.\u201976 With apostates faithful \nto the memory of Nayler long after his death it is not surprising that Friends withdrew from the \nuse of exalting language; still less that the controversial books were not reprinted. \n \n 12 \n \nAs Damrosch has identified, some tracts included in the volume were silently edited, \u2018usually for \nstylistic reasons but sometimes for significant doctrinal ones\u201977 whilst for the same reasons \nothers were left out entirely. Indeed, analysis of both the absent works and those included in the \nCollection has highlighted changes in theology and social attitudes between the 1650s and 1710s. \nFriends succeeded in obscuring early forms of Quakerism considered radical, enthusiastic and \nunsound at the time of editing, confirming that Quaker religious beliefs and social aspirations \nhad changed tremendously in the intervening period. The collection was, then, produced in part \nbecause of pressure from the remnants of Nayler\u2019s followers, \u2018only after much debate and with \nmany misgivings\u201978, and not only because of the generosity of Whitehead noted by Damrosch, \nwho depicts the Collection as a result of his solitary labours.79 It was also published in response \nto external pressures, such as popular images of Friends in plays and anti-Quaker histories from \nthe late seventeenth century. In English popular literature Friends had became a \u2018cultural \nstereotype\u201980 and Nayler especially was remembered by writers up to the 1720s. Depicted as the \ncaptain of \u2018that frantick self-afflicting crew of trembling Quakers\u201981 by Billingsley in 1658, by \nthe 1670s he was placed alongside notorious figures representing inversions of the social, gender \nand moral order, including  the peasant leaders Watt Tyler and Jack Straw, Pope Joan, and the \npolygamous Anabaptist prophet and sometime king of Muenster Jan van Leiden.82 Fifty years \nafter his downfall, Friends were still depicted as \u2018Brethren of the Quaking Naylor\u2019.83\n \nPerhaps most significantly, Edward Ward\u2019s History of the Grand Rebellion, first published three \nyears before the Sundry Books, included an account of \u2018Naylor the Quaking Saint\u2019, depicted as  \n\u2018wearing such a forked Beard\/ And Head of Hair, compos\u2019d as might agree\/ With those we in the \nVolto Santo see\/ Affecting many Phrases which were us\u2019d\/ By Christ, whose Words and \n \n 13 \nGodhead he abus\u2019d\/ So far as to blaspheme his Holy Name\/ By preaching up himself to be the \nsame\u2019.84 Based on the report of a committee of fifty-five M.P.s given in December 1656, in \nwhich Nayler was accused of assuming \u2018the gestures, words, honour, worship and miracles\u201985 of \nJesus, the durability of this stereotype, \u2018the least pliable of literary sorts, the one least sensitive to \nsocial vibrations\u201986 was probably of great concern to Friends who had no control over the content \nof plays, songs and poetry. They had to weigh up the pros and cons of republishing Nayler\u2019s \nworks, including the potential of the volume to direct attention away from stock representations \nof Nayler, especially those which suggested that he aspired to resemble the Volto Santo, a \ncrucifix based on the face of Jesus impressed on Veronica\u2019s veil, towards the orthodox Quaker \ndepiction of a misled man who truly repented and was, at times, genuinely inspired.  \n \nHowever, more impartial accounts did not necessarily receive universal acceptance. The Dutch \nReformed pastor Gerard Croese\u2019s General History, written in the early 1690s with the assistance \nof the Dutch Friend Willem Sewel, and published in Latin in 1695 and in English and German in \n1696,87 was the earliest full-length history of Quakerism, but it fell foul of the Meeting, as it was \nconsidered to include \u2018some things not true in Fact\u2019.88 Sewel described the published version as \n\u2018imperfect and defective\u2019, as Croese \u2018knew better\u2019.89 Justin Champion has identified the \nimportance of \u2018truth\u2019 to historical writing of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Such \nclaims, he suggests, were \u2018essential to conveying a political or theological precept in historical \nform.\u201990 Although Croese was asked to allow a postscript and corrections, by 1696 news had \nreached the Meeting that Dutch Friends \u2018have Writt Something and intend to print against the \ns[ai]d History\u2019.91 This was in part because, as the English manuscript translation revealed, it \ncarried \u2018Reflections on Fri[en]ds\u2019, although the printer, John Dunton, was willing to publish an \nappendix with the volume, \u2018to correct any false acco.[un]ts\u2019.92 In addition, the apostate Francis \n \n 14 \nBugg, \u2018the bitterest and most persistent\u2019 of the period had also, by 1697, \u2018corrected\u2019 the work, \napparently at the request of the Church of England.93 Although he claimed Croese\u2019s work had \nnot given \u2018an impartial Account...[of] ways and methods by which Quakerism have grown and \nincreased\u2019, he concluded that it was otherwise \u2018very well done\u2019.94 Indeed, he only commented on \nthe sections which he wished to amend, such as the negative depiction of English magistrates.95 \nTellingly, however, he made no reference to the Nayler incident.96 Presumably Croese\u2019s version \nwas considered damning enough. Tainted by falsehood and Bugg\u2019s efforts, the General History \nhad to be superseded by an orthodox account. \n \nChampion\u2019s scholarship on denominational history has suggested that rival accounts of \necclesiastical history in the Restoration era, by Anglicans and Freethinkers, represented \n\u2018competing human claims\u2019 over \u2018the authoritative interpretation of truth.\u201997 In this sense, Sewel\u2019s \nHistory, translated into English and published after considerable amendment in 1722, represents \nQuaker contribution to historical debate in England in the period. Seeking to represent Friends as \nrespectable, and to distance them from accusations of radicalism, enthusiasm and disorder, \nFriends sought, like Anglicans of the same period, to provide a way to \u2018religious and moral \nrectitude.\u201998 As Champion asserts, to claim to be \u2018good, religious and true\u2019 was not enough; \u2018the \nability to present a cogent and credible version of the past could shore up such a claim.\u201999 Whilst \nAnglicans sought to defend themselves from atheism and deism, Friends defended themselves \nfrom Anglican criticism, including that of Bugg, whilst being regularly prosecuted. Indeed, by \nchoosing to rework the title of Bugg\u2019s anti-Quaker \u2018history of the rise, growth and progress of \nQuakerism\u2019, Sewel\u2019s account of their \u2018rise, increase and progress\u2019 reclaimed control over their \nhistory. The English version of the Nayler episode is particularly illustrative, showing \neighteenth-century Quaker rejection of extreme behaviour alongside the depiction of a penitent \n \n 15 \nsinner; explicitly denying White Kennett\u2019s claim in A Complete History of England (1706) that \nhe died without signs of repentance, it demonstrates the extent to which the English Quaker \nrepresentation of Nayler had become the only one acceptable.100  \n \nAs Champion notes, the Restoration \u2018saw many rival claims to be the true religion.\u2019101 \nQuakerism was no exception. Whilst Locke, who influenced Anglican writers, believed that \nhumanity had only been afforded \u2018twilight knowledge\u2019, and so had to rely upon probabilities,102 \nSewel considered the \u2018Time of Twilight\u2019 to have ended as the Protestant Reformation had \nreached its zenith with Quakerism.103 Providing a spiritual genealogy for Friends he asserted that \nGod only gradually enlightened men, including Calvin and Luther, as \u2018idolatry had so \nuniversally blinded mankind that...it would have been impossible for them to have understood \nthe declaration of an entirely reformed religion\u2019.104 Using the analogy of a man kept imprisoned \nin the dark, Sewel suggested that in the twilight, \u2018he would by Degrees have learned to discern \nthe Objects and come to an Ability of beholding every Thing in a clear Day aright.\u2019 For Friends, \nthe clear day had arrived. The Inner Light of God inspiring and guiding the eighteenth-century \nbeliever meant Quaker history-writing was shaped with this in mind. In this respect, the History \nmay also be seen as a rival account to those of Gilbert Burnet and Edward Stillingfleet, \nestablishing Quakerism within Reformation history, a subject of \u2018persistent importance\u2019.105 \nDuring an era of religious disunity, such histories provided created assurance for both Anglican \nand Quaker audiences.106 Friends\u2019 claims that they suffered continued martyrdom for the tithe \ntestimony at the hands of the established church were \u2018shored up\u2019 by the History, just as \nStillingfleet\u2019s history aimed to refute \u2018anti-episcopalian visions\u2019 of the history of the Church of \nEngland, in a period when the relationship between Church, priest and civil sovereignty was a \nsource of clerical dissension.107 For Quakers as well as Anglicans, the Interregnum and \n \n 16 \nRestoration were important to their accounts and, for Friends especially, were a period which \nneeded to be depicted carefully. If, as Champion suggests, \u2018the presentation of the past, became a \ndisplaced crucible for ideological dispute\u2019108 then Sewel\u2019s genealogy may have been intended as \na corrective to German and Dutch depictions of Quakerism in works such as Anabaptisticum et \nenthusiaticum Pantheon (1701-2) which borrowed elements from depictions of Muenster \nAnabaptists \u2018imprinted on the Lutheran consciousness in exaggerated and grotesque outlines as \nveritable monsters, set up by the devil as a rival show to the Reformation.\u2019109\n \nHowever, although Dutch Friends did not write against it, contention has been identified between \nDutch and English Friends over the account of the Nayler episode given in the first full-length \nhistory of Quakerism written by a Quaker.110 Sewel\u2019s manuscript was originally considered by \nEnglish Friends in 1712, when Francis Davis gave an account of Sewel\u2019s \u2018great & long Industry\u2019. \nObjections by eminent Friends in 1716, the year the Collection was published, culminated with a \nrequest that the Dutch version of Nayler\u2019s trial would not \u2018be Exposed to Publick View\u2019. English \nFriends had been given a manuscript section of the Dutch version, but no comment on its \npublication in 1717 is registered.111 This may explain the lack of attention given to the Dutch \nedition by scholars such as Damrosch, who does not consider the original version, only referring \nto the English translation.112 In 1721 the Meeting commented upon sections of the Histori, \npresumably available in English, including a proposition that \u2018Robert Barclay\u2019s Theses, may be a \nBetter Summary of our Principles\u2019.113 The most significant alteration, though, was made to the \nsection on Nayler, and is \u2018interesting both for its omissions and additions.\u2019114 The Meeting \nprepared a substitute section for the English version, which claimed, upon publication in 1722, to \nhave been \u2018revis\u2019d... with some amendments\u2019, and these were certainly carried out to fulfil \nEnglish ideas of orthodoxy.115 Appearing only a few years after the Sundry Books, it was \n \n 17 \nimperative that the official History depicted Nayler in a similar way to Whitehead\u2019s Introduction, \nand this is evident when the Dutch and English editions are compared. \n \nOne of the most significant differences is the lack of footnotes in the Dutch original. These are \nespecially important in the English edition, where they clarify Nayler\u2019s status. A description of \nhis \u2018honest parents\u2019 is accompanied by a footnote about his father, a husbandman \u2018of good \nRepute\u2019.116 Husbandry, for eighteenth-century male Friends, represented a spiritual and moral \nstate, even for those who were not husbandmen by occupation. As part of the tithe testimony, \n\u2018the imagery and language of husbandry\u2019 contrasted an exploitative clergy with productive \nhusbandmen.117 In Nayler\u2019s case this also rooted him firmly in the Quakerism of the eighteenth \ncentury. Champion has suggested that the use of footnoting had originated in the late seventeenth \ncentury as \u2018the attempt to accredit a particular text with authority...an image of transparent truth\u2019 \nso those without references became suspected as fictional, or untrue.118 However, unlike \nFreethinkers and Anglicans who vied to provide \u2018the more creditworthy account of the truth\u2019119, \nSewel\u2019s History aimed to provide the truth itself, albeit after several attempts. Perhaps also \nbecause of this shift in emphasis, the English version of the History does not include several \nletters about Nayler, including a petition by Robert Rich.120 Although probably used by Sewel as \nadditional proof of his probity as a historian, as a form of testimony, \u2018anchoring the text in \nprobable reality\u2019121, the individuals named were presumably thought unsuitable by the Second \nDay Meeting: Rich had been expelled from Quakerism partly for his unorthodox view of \nNayler\u2019s trial and sentence as a form of martyrdom122 and unofficial pro-Nayler histories of the  \n\u2018innocent, humble holy meek\u2019, and \u2018Thrice blessed Saint\u2019123 were still appearing in the early \neighteenth century. Orthodox Quakerism needed an official version laced with footnotes to prove \n \n 18 \nthat although Nayler was not holy, he did come from respectable stock and was manipulated into \nblasphemy. Thus Sewel\u2019s original assertion that Nayler resembled \u2018our Saviour in the letter of \nPublius Lentelus written to the Senate of Rome\u2019124 was removed. Although Damrosch asserts \nthat early Friends had \u2018a fondness\u2019 for this description,125 eighteenth-century English Friends \nprudently wanted to disassociate themselves from it.126 Only a few years earlier Ward had \nalleged that Nayler\u2019s blasphemy lay partly in his use of early Christian texts to resemble Christ. \n \nThe English version also stresses the role of outside influence in Nayler\u2019s downfall. A passage \nlisting Nayler\u2019s female followers, including Martha Simmonds, is absent from the Dutch \naccount, whilst in the English it is used to blame them for Nayler becoming \u2018clouded in his \nunderstanding, bewildered, and at a loss in his judgment\u2019.127 Although Damrosch suggests that \nSewel was uneasy about \u2018rebuking women for doing what men were freely permitted to do\u2019, \nspecifically Simmonds\u2019 public disputations with male Quakers, the accompanying footnote, \nadded by the Meeting and not, as Damrosch claims, by Sewel, highlights the nature of English \nFriends\u2019 conservative revisions as it limited Quaker women to an involuntary \u2018impulse or \nconcern to prophesy\u2019, rather than \u2018reasoning or disputing.\u2019128 As Tarter suggests, such moves \neffectively silenced them.129 However, the desire of the Meeting to control the image of English \nQuakerism is most apparent in the 1742 German edition.130 English Friends had been particularly \nkeen to prevent the Dutch Histori from reaching Germany, \u2018where we have been greatly \nmisrepresented by some adversaries\u2019, and several edicts had been passed to prosecute \ndissenters.131 \u2018Misrepresentations\u2019 included Blome\u2019s Historia and other works in the Pantheon, a \n\u2018spiritual armoury\u2019 against Quakers.132 Such works borrowed elements from depictions of \nGerman Anabaptists, and included illustrations of Naylor\u2019s entry into Bristol, with verses \nhighlighting the role of Nayler\u2019s female followers, possibly alluding to the polygamist van \n \n 19 \nLeiden.133 Having, then, rejected Croese\u2019s Quaker-Historie, there was no official account in \nGerman until Sewel\u2019s Geschichte, \u2018newly revised and published with some corrections\u2019, a direct \ntranslation from the English with little mention of the Dutch original.134 English Quakerism had, \nin this respect, become the adjudicator of orthodoxy, with English the language of Quaker belief. \nAlthough, as Bailey suggests, written history may \u2018validate a faith experience\u2019, discord between \nbelievers led in this case to the suppression of other accounts.135\n \nAlthough by the time Nayler\u2019s works were republished, individual Friends were respected \nfigures in the community, it was still relatively easy for enemies to refer to the group of young \nradicals who in the 1650s had not been pacifist, had openly condemned other denominations, and \nhad been accused of blasphemy for their religious principles, some of which they later rejected. \nAs Peters has concluded, \u2018Nayler cast a long shadow over the movement\u2019136, but it was longer \nand more influential than she suggests. The content of his works had to justify their publication \nas those of an eminent early Friend, and reflect eighteenth-century orthodoxy. The Collection \ncould then be read by, amongst others, sympathetic outsiders who would find their \npreconceptions of Nayler refuted by the piety and orthodoxy of his writings, and a historical \naccount which avoided his more contentious affiliations and emphasized his status alongside \nother early Quakers as a spiritual husbandman. Nayler was still, however, a controversial figure. \nIn 1732 the bishop of Lichfield commended his punishment for blasphemy, almost a century \nlater.137 Amongst Friends, though, the dying words of the suffering penitent remained a source of \ninspiration. Cuthbert Wigham, a Northumberland convert, took comfort when persecuted for his \ntithe testimony in the 1730s from Nayler\u2019s deathbed assertion, reproduced in Sewel\u2019s History, \nthat \u2018There is a spirit which I feel, that delights to do no evil, nor to revenge any wrong; but \ndelights to endure all things\u2019.138 Although twentieth-century theologians proclaimed Nayler\u2019s \n \n 20 \n                                                \nwritings \u2018a sure canon\u2019 of original Quakerism139 Barclay and Penn came to represent the \nrespectable, peaceable manhood idealised in publications of the late-seventeenth and eighteenth \ncenturies, whilst Nayler\u2019s works, unlike his repentance, remained underappreciated. As a former \nQuaker radical, they had to be scrutinised and edited before they could be viewed by the \nsympathetic and the critical. \nMany thanks to those who commented on the original version of this paper, presented at the \n\u2018George Fox\u2019s Legacy: 350 Years of Quakerism\u2019 conference at Swarthmore College, PA. in \nOctober 2002, and at the BSECS conference at St. Hugh\u2019s College, Oxford in January 2004. \nThanks especially to Mark Jenner, for reading the draft version and highlighting areas of debate, \nand to Florian Gleisner, for his assistance in the translation of Dutch and German works. \n \n \n1.
