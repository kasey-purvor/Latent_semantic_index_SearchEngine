A selection \nof slang terms from Britain and the United States is used to explore gaps \nand trends in the dictionaries\u201f contents. The paper concludes by arguing that \nthe best user-edited dictionaries have high editorial aspirations, and that \neven the worst can make a useful contribution to our knowledge of \ncontemporary slang, which changes so quickly that a paper dictionary \ncannot possibly keep pace. Urban Dictionary undoubtedly has the most \nextensive coverage, but other sites challenge it in a number of respects. \n \nKeywords: slang, online lexicography \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nIn recent years, the history of lexicography has been overturned by \ntechnological developments, both in making source materials more readily \navailable and in providing new modes of publication. Online dictionaries \noffer possibilities to users and compilers far beyond those of traditional \npublishing formats. The Oxford English Dictionary online, for example, is \nnow updated on a regular basis, not only with new sections of the alphabet, \nbut also with words of particular interest to its users at the time. Researchers \ncan also use the online edition to explore the history of the dictionary itself, \nand second edition entries are maintained alongside third edition entries to \nfacilitate this. The third edition of the OED no longer appears to \ndiscriminate against widely-used slang terms, but clearly cannot document \nthe meaning and use of every ephemeral term used within small groups of \nspeakers everywhere in the English-speaking world. This suggests that there \nis still a place for specialized slang lexicography, and this paper asks how \nfar online slang dictionaries take advantage of the possibilities of online \npublication while maintaining high standards of lexicography. \n \n \nStatic and dynamic online dictionaries \n \nOnline slang dictionaries can be categorized along a spectrum from the \nstatic to the dynamic. The static end of the spectrum is occupied by text-\nbased lists. Typically they offer no opportunity for user-input and remain \nunedited after their initial online publication. Occasionally they include live \nlinks in place of cross-references, or are divided by letter and accessed by \nclicking on the appropriate part of the alphabet, but otherwise their only \nadvantage over paper publication is (for the user) that they are freely \navailable and (for the lexicographer) that no tiresome obstacles are put in \nthe way by reviewers or proof-readers. \nAt the opposite end of the spectrum are dynamic online dictionaries. \nThese take full advantage of the possibilities offered by internet publication \nby including live links, illustrations, sound files, maps, and so on. They are \nalso updated on a regular basis, frequently encourage user-input, and \ngenerally provide statistics about the use of the website or of the terms \nlisted. \nThis paper will discuss six online slang dictionaries selected to \nillustrate different points on this spectrum from static to dynamic. These are \nRegency Slang by Robert and June Whitworth, the Peak English Slang \nDictionary by Distance Learning Inc., the Rap Dictionary by Patrick Atoon \nand Niels Janssen, the Online Dictionary of Playground Slang by Chris \nLewis, A Dictionary of Slang by Ted Duckworth, Urban Dictionary by \nAaron Peckham, and The Online Slang Dictionary by Walter Rader. URLs \nare listed in the reference section below. All were accessed during the last \nweek of October 2009, except where otherwise specified. \n \n \nThe dictionaries \n \nRegency Slang \n \nRegency Slang is the most static of the lists discussed here. It forms part of a \nwebsite called Prints George, which offers a light-hearted introduction to \nvarious aspects of life during the period of George IV\u201fs regency (1811-20) \nto promote \u201cgenuine reproductions\u201d of maps and illustrations from the \nperiod as well as jigsaw puzzles and craft packs. Entries are presented in a \ntable with two columns: one for headword and the other for definition. A \nrepresentative entry reads: \n \nable-wackets blows given on the palm of the hand with a twisted \nhandkerchief [sic], instead of a ferula; a jocular punishment among \nseamen, who sometimes play at cards for wackets, the loser \nsuffering as many strokes as he has lost games. \n \nThis is probably reproduced either from Grose (1811) or the related \ndictionary by Egan (1823), but there is no additional editorial input. These, \nand three other Regency texts are acknowledged as the dictionary\u201fs sources. \nNo requests are made for corrections or additional information on the \nwebsite. \nThe glossary is divided by letter, although the 759 headwords \navailable all fall in the letters A and B. There is no \u201esearch\u201f facility: terms \ncan only be located by clicking on their first letter and then scrolling down \nthe page, though the \u201efind\u201f function of the user\u201fs browser can be used to \nexpedite this process. \n \nPeak English Slang Dictionary \n \nPeak English Slang Dictionary is part of an online interactive English \nSchool offering courses, assessment, and contact with ESL students and \nteachers around the world. The slang glossary is supported by a \u201eslang \nforum,\u201f and users can send one another \u201eslang cards\u201f or click on \u201eslang of \nthe day.\u201f The glossary lists approximately 1,160 headwords, and a click on \nthe headword takes the user to a definition and example(s) of use. For \nexample: \n \nmy bad \nDefinition: To take the blame; acknowledge that you did something \nwrong.  \nExample:  1) Don\u201ft worry about the accident. It\u201fs my bad.  \n2) He\u201fs not your brother? My bad... I have difficulty \nremembering names. \n \nMany entries also include a colourful cartoon, particularly towards the \nbeginning of the alphabet and\/or a sound clip of the headword and example. \nSynonyms and etymologies are also sometimes provided. There is no \nopportunity for user-input to this glossary, and no information about \nrevision frequency or methodology. \nUsers can browse each letter of the alphabet, though entries are not \nlisted alphabetically beyond the first letter (entries for Q run: quick buck, \nquitting time, queer, queen, quickie, quack, quit it). They can also \u201epick a \ncategory,\u201f ranging from acronyms and insults to sex and sports, although \nsome categories (e.g. nasty) do not generate any results. Finally, users can \nsearch for specific words. The query \u201ecut,\u201f for instance, generates a list of \nall headwords including those letters: cut a deal, cut and dry, cut it out, cut \nit, cut the cheese, executive summary, cutting-edge, cut corners. Because a \nsmall font is used, a great many headwords fit on a single screen, and the \nuser can thus easily locate the correct definition if it is available. \n \nThe Online Dictionary of Playground Slang \n \nThe Online Dictionary of Playground Slang website includes eight separate, \nbut sometimes overlapping, dictionaries: of playground slang, ghastly \ngames, buzzwords, hymns and arias, songs and rhymes, gay slang, tongue \ntwisters, and nursery rhymes. The playground slang dictionary was the first, \nand the website lists 3,603 terms in this collection. The other lists appear to \nhave arisen as a result of interest by users or the compiler in concentrating \non a new area of research. Users were able to submit terms for inclusion and \nthese were vetted before appearing online, but it is no longer possible to \ncontribute to the dictionaries. The site includes targeted advertisements via \n\u201eAmazon Recommends\u201f and Google\u201fs \u201eAdSense,\u201f but has not been updated \nsince June 2007. Lewis also published a paperback dictionary based on the \nwebsite (Lewis 2003). \nEntries typically include a usage label, definition, examples, and \nindication of dates of use and\/or source. For example: \n \nall mouth and trousers  \ncolloq. \nDescribes someone who claims to be able to carry out tasks and \nduties but does not have the necessary sckills [sic] and abilities to \nperform to a satisfactory standard. For example. \u201cJohnny said he \nwas going to beat rhe [sic] shit out of Will after the game but it turns \nout he\u201fs all mouth and trousers - Will gave him the finest kicking of \nhiso [sic] life!\u201d. \nSource: circa current, UK \n \nThe authority behind the \u201ecirca current\u201f and \u201eUK\u201f labels is not clear, but \nthese appear to be the work of the site editor, sometimes with input from \nother dictionary users who have queried the editor\u201fs designations. Entries \nare dated, and many provide live links to synonymous terms. \nAfter clicking on one of the dictionaries, the user can browse the \ndictionary alphabetically, choose from a list of recently added terms, or \nperform a search. The search \u201ecut\u201f located 32 results in the playground slang \ndictionary, organized largely, but not entirely, alphabetically. Entries \nincluding cut in the headword were numbered 4, 8-16, 21, 26 and 29. \nSearches thus produce a fair amount of background noise, but for a less \ncommon word this has the advantage of enabling the user to locate \nexamples of use where no definition is available. \nIt is also possible to search all eight dictionaries on the website \nsimultaneously, though this option is not available at the home page located \nby Google. From the highest level page located by Google, the user has to \nclick on one of the dictionaries and then click back to \u201ethe main page\u201f to \nlocate this option. A search for \u201ecut\u201f located 56 results, listed separately for \neach dictionary. The level of background noise is the same as in the single \ndictionary search, with the additional requirement of clicking on each \ndictionary name: terms including cut in the definition are listed alongside \nthose with cut in their headword. It is thus easiest to search this dictionary \nby browsing. \n \nA Dictionary of Slang \n \nA Dictionary of Slang includes a number of features that ought to be \nstandard in online slang dictionaries: a short account of the remit of the \ndictionary (this one concentrates on usage in the United Kingdom), \nparticularly with reference to the boundary between slang and dialect or \ncolloquialisms, remarks about the difficulty of providing authoritative dates \nand etymologies for slang terms, a reminder that some of the terms listed \nmight have become obsolete, and an apology for any offence caused by the \ncontents of the word-list. There is also quite a lengthy bibliography, with \nlinks to Amazon for books still in print, and a list of abbreviations used in \nthe dictionary. Links are provided to other online slang sites (of which there \nare many), and a \u201enews\u201f page documents a few technological developments \nand changes in editorial policy. Advertisements are included on the home \npage of the dictionary, but these appear to be permanent and untargeted. A \ncounter logs over 8 million visits to the site since April 1998, and the word-\nlist contains 5,948 headwords, some of which have several definitions. \nUsers can submit by sending an email through the site to its owner, \nand are asked to \u201cgive the meaning of the expression, and if possible, an \nexample of it in use,\u201d as well as to indicate where in the United Kingdom \nthe expression was heard. Only the editor can put material online, and it \nappears in a table format similar to that found in the Regency Dictionary: \n \nnick Verb. 1. To arrest. E.g. \u201cRight Mr Hall, please step out of the \ncar, you\u201fre nicked for speeding.\u201d \n2. To steal. \n3. To take, have. E.g. \u201cCan I nick a cigarette until later? I\u201fll buy a \npacket when I get my wages.\u201d \nNoun. A police station. \nAdj. Quality. Usually heard in the expressions, good nick or bad \nnick. E.g. \u201cFor that much money, you\u201fd expect it to be in good \nnick.\u201d \n \nExamples of use, etymologies, and usage labels are sometimes provided. \nParts of speech are generally included, but are sometimes inaccurate, as in \nthe designation of the final usage in this example. \nUsers can browse alphabetically or enter a search term in a box \npowered by atomz.com. Search tips are offered and the search engine offers \na number of options: \u201eany word,\u201f \u201eall words,\u201f \u201eexact phrase,\u201f or \u201esound-alike \nmatching.\u201f Sound-alike matching ought to be particularly useful for slang \nsearches, where spellings are not formalized, but is less necessary in a \ndictionary with a high level of consistency engendered by single-editor \ncontrol. Some context is provided for each result, enabling the user to \ndetermine whether or not to follow it up. Results can be ordered by score or \ndate, and the user can also select how many results are displayed. Users can \nnarrow their searches further by electing to search \u201ebody,\u201f \u201etitle,\u201f \n\u201edescription,\u201f \u201ekeywords,\u201f \u201eanywhere,\u201f \u201ealternate text,\u201f or \u201eURL,\u201f though \nsome trial and error is necessary to determine what these different fields \ninclude. Using both \u201ecut\u201f and \u201emad\u201f as test search-terms, searches in the \n\u201ebody\u201f and \u201eanywhere\u201f field yielded the same number of results in each \ncase. All other searches yielded no results. \n \nThe Rap Dictionary \n \nThe Rap Dictionary describes itself as \u201cthe oldest and ultimate resource for \nlooking up hip-hop slang,\u201d and traces its origins to a text-based glossary \ncirculated in the newsgroup alt.rap in 1992. In 1994 the list moved on to the \nWorld Wide Web, and in 2004 it was adapted for wiki technology, which \nallows registered users to add and edit dictionary entries. It claims \u201c4,707 \ncontent pages,\u201d many of which are encyclopaedic, representing an increase \nof about 4% since March 2009. An unusual feature of this website is that it \nincludes a wish-list: users can request definitions for terms not already \nincluded on the site. Encyclopaedic entries often include photographs, maps, \nlinks to news stories, or tables of contents, but lexical entries are generally \nshort and tend to include nothing more than a definition, example, and \netymology (and not always all three). For example, the entry for bling bling \nreads: \n \nnoun \nBling Bling \n1. Jewelry such as chains, watches, bracelets, rings, earrings, etc. \nThis term originated from the hip-hop artist BG aka B-Gizzle \n(formerly 1 of the the [sic] hot boys). (White Man\u201fs definition) \nBling is described as the shinning [sic] light that appears on \nmaterials of great value such as jewelry, gold, silver, and platinum.  \nAll come in colors of Diamond, Silver, Gold, and Plat \nBling Bling, usually used like \u201cYo brotha, check my bling bling!\u201d or \n\u201cCheck my blingage.\u201d \n  \nThis entry has no live links, but some other lexical entries do. The site \ncarries targeted advertisements under Google\u201fs \u201eAdSense\u201f programme. \nFrom the home page, the user can choose between four main \nheadings: \u201eDictionary,\u201f \u201eArtists,\u201f \u201eSome Artists,\u201f and \u201eJust Some Terms.\u201f \nThe last two offer a selection of entries from the first two. \u201eDictionary\u201f and \n\u201eArtists\u201f can be browsed as a whole, or their contents divided into sub-\ncategories for browsing. Sub-categories include parts of speech for the \ndictionary or \u201egroups,\u201f \u201elabels,\u201f or \u201eproducers\u201f among the \u201eArtists.\u201f A search \nfor \u201ecut\u201f in the \u201eDictionary\u201f section located a noun with seven separate \ndefinitions and a verb with six, including phrasal usages. It is also possible \nto view earlier versions of each page, which might enable future \nlexicographers to chart the semantic or grammatical development of \nindividual terms, and a slight reduction in content pages since September \n2009 suggests that the editors are pruning submissions where necessary. \nBrowseable word-lists are fully alphabetized, but only the first 200 \nexamples are shown in each case, necessitating much clicking to reach the \nend of the alphabet. This means that users are more likely to use the search \nfacility, but searches only locate headwords identical to the search term: the \nentries for Mad Cowz, Mad Swan Blood, and Madhatter are not located by a \nsearch for \u201emad.\u201f There are no \u201e*\u201f or \u201e?\u201f wildcards: these symbols are read \nliterally, with resulting messages like \u201cThere is no page titled \u201emad*\u201f. You \ncan create this page.\u201d A note comments that \u201cUnsuccessful searches are \noften caused by searching for common words like \u201ehave\u201f and \u201efrom,\u201f which \nare not indexed, or by specifying more than one search term (only pages \ncontaining all of the search terms will appear in the result).\u201d Variability in \nheadword forms is inevitable in a multi-editor dictionary, so despite the \ncumbersome browsing facility, browsing remains the surest way of locating \nentries in this dictionary. \n \nUrban Dictionary \n \nUrban Dictionary claims over 4.3 million \u201cdefinitions written since 1999,\u201d \neach of which is dated and bears the name but not the location of its author. \nThis is an increase of approximately 7.5% since March 2009. Headwords \ncan be searched or browsed, and there is also a \u201erandom\u201f function and a \n\u201eword of the day\u201f (online, by email or RSS readers, from mobile phones, on \nTwitter, Facebook, or Google Calendar). Any definition can be printed on a \nmug with the Urban Dictionary logo, and the website also promotes Urban \nDictionary baseball caps, two paperback dictionaries containing entries \nfrom the website (Peckham 2005; Peckham 2007), and Urban Dictionary \ncalendars (e.g. Peckham 2008; Peckham 2009). Links are provided to \nAmazon and Barnes & Noble for those items that cannot be ordered direct \nfrom the Urban Dictionary website. Google\u201fs \u201eAdSense\u201f program inserts \ntargeted advertisements on the home page and between the definitions for \neach word. Users are also encouraged to email a link to their friends or share \nit on del.icio.us, Facebook, or Twitter. \nAll users can post definitions, which are reviewed by editors before \npublication. However, anyone can sign up as an editor, and the review \nprocess appears to involve checking that posts observe the terms of service \nrather than evaluating their content. Editors can also recommend the \nremoval of individual posts, but these decisions are reviewed by other \neditors before they are implemented. Contributors post competing \ndefinitions for the same sense rather than editing existing entries. These \nmultiple definitions are available simultaneously, and are ranked according \nto users\u201f clicks on an upward or downward pointing thumb. Definitions that \nhave received the most positive responses appear at the top of the first page \nof results.

Anything placed within square brackets in the \u201edefinition\u201f or \n\u201eexample\u201f field becomes a live link, and many entries also include images \nposted by users. The contents of user postings are inevitably varied, but \nthree of the fifteen definitions for hinky will illustrate the contents of the \ndictionary: \n \nSomething as yet undefinable is wrong, out of place; not quite \nright. \nThere\u2019s something hinky about the deal. (tradesman Apr 4, 2003: \nOctober 2, 2009 Urban Word of the Day) \n \nA cop\u201fs version of \u201cI\u201fve a bad feeling about that\u201d \nAn event or thing which is \n1) Out of whack \n2) Wrong \n3) Off kilter \nThat porridge taste hinky to you? (Vernon Conan Chan Dec 31, \n2004) \n \nthe instant of knowledge when one becomes deeply aware that \nthere is pure evil fuckery afoot. \nShe knew something was hinky when her husband returned from \nthe store without his underwear... (Lisa Shields Aug 18, 2004) \n \nThe first definition received 3,756 thumbs up, 2,211 down; the second 169 \nup, 56 down; and the third 173 up, 76 down. Since they all define roughly \nthe same usage, these votes are an evaluation of the definition rather than an \nindication of frequency of use, but there is no exploration of what criteria \nusers should employ, and sometimes users rank defamatory and \nunnecessarily obscene comments more highly than functional definitions. \nThe browseable word-list defaults to \u201emost popular words,\u201f but the \nuser can select an alphabetical listing of all words. Browsing is facilitated by \nthe division of the list into first and also second letters, though the second \nletters (\u201eca,\u201f \u201ecb,\u201f etc.) are points in the whole list rather than self-contained \nunits. For example, a user browsing for \u201ecut\u201f who clicks on \u201ecu\u201f will be \ntaken to page 489 of the C words: a sequence running from CT2004 to cu \ntang, with only five entries that fall in the \u201ecu\u201f range. Then it is possible to \nclick \u201enext\u201f until reaching the desired headword, or to guess how many \npages ahead that result will be. Browsing is thus a labour-intensive process, \nbut it does alert the user to the duplication of headwords. For example, over \na page is dedicated to headwords beginning with cut. Searching is a more \npractical option, and here the Urban Dictionary website has the advantage \nover other slang dictionary sites in its predictive search box: as the user \nspells out \u201ecut,\u201f the box predicts possible entries, and for long words or \nphrases this can save typing time. Results for a search on \u201ecut\u201f include a \njumbled mixture of nominal, verbal, and adjectival senses spread across 113 \nseparate submissions. The most popular of these lists five senses, each \nillustrated by an example of use: in only three out of five cases does the \nexample of use match the grammatical function implied by the definition. \nThere are a further 17 submission for cuts, 4 for cutz, 36 for cutting, 3 each \nfor cuttin and cuttin\u2019, 76 for cutter, and 18 for cutters. As has already been \nnoted, there are a large number of other submissions beginning with cut. \nThere appears to be no way to locate headwords in which cut is not the first \nword, although a Google search sometimes locates Urban Dictionary \nsubmissions. In summary, this uncontrolled multiple-editor dictionary is \nunwieldy for searching and browsing if the user\u201fs intention is to locate all \nrelevant submissions. However, users who just want to find a definition for \na particular slang word will probably be able to locate a definition of some \nkind easily, no matter what spelling or grammatical form they enter in the \nsearch box. \n \nThe Online Slang Dictionary \n \nThe Online Slang Dictionary is subtitled \u201eAmerican and English Slang,\u201f and \nlists approximately 13,400 headwords (an increase of just over 100% since \nMarch 2009), of which perhaps a fifth are marked as \u201efeatured words,\u201f \n\u201cedited for spelling, grammar, accuracy, etc.\u201d by its editor, Walter Rader. \nEntries that aren\u201ft \u201efeatured\u201f are unmediated submissions from registered \nusers, who agree to a complicated set of terms and conditions, but \napparently choose to add new entries in preference to editing existing ones, \nand this has created considerable duplication (e.g. burn out, burnout, burn \n(one) out, burnt out, burned out). Unregistered users can report on their own \nusage by choosing \u201eI use it,\u201f \u201eNo longer use it,\u201f \u201eHeard it but never used it,\u201f \nor \u201eHave never heard it.\u201f They can also plot their position on a world map \nand click on a chilli pepper to register their sense of how vulgar the word is, \nalthough the instructions are not entirely unambiguous: \u201cVote how vulgar \nthe word is \u2013 not how mean it is.\u201d For each term, links are provided in \nformats appropriate for pasting into webpages and wikis, and targeted \nadvertisements are provided by Google \u201eAdSense.\u201f A \u201eThesaurus\u201f function \nallows users to locate groups of synonyms, and links to relevant groups of \nterms are provided from the pages for individual words. A blog documents \nthe addition of new terms and features since the dictionary moved to its \ncurrent web-address in 2007. \nThe entry for 404 is one that has been edited, and thus bears Rader\u201fs \nstamp of approval, although it remains open for editing by registered users: \n \nadjective \n- missing or misplaced. \nMy car keys are 404. \nby Eric B., Fort Worth, TX, USA, Aug 10 1998. \n noun \n- an unintelligent person; MORON, DIMWIT. \nI wouldn\u201ft ask him, he\u201fs a 404. \nby Walt W., Natick, Massachusetts, USA, Jun 17 2003. \n- a worthless person, place, or thing. \nDon\u201ft go to that bar - it\u201fs a 404. \nby Robbie G., Stroud, Hampshire, UK, Feb 13 2006. \n \nverb \n- to not know or temporarily forget; DRAW A BLANK. \nI\u201fm 404ing on that. \nby The Jargon File, Aug 04 2009. \n \norigin \n- 404 is the web code for \u201cweb page not found.\u201d \nby Anonymous, Jul 17 2007. \n \nUnfortunately, the user feedback functions for usage, distribution, and \nvulgarity do not operate on the level of individual definitions, so it is \nimpossible to register that one uses 404 in the verbal sense but not the \nadjectival one. The provision of names and locations as well as dates for \neach sense may explain why so many individuals have contributed to this \ndictionary: their contribution is immediately acknowledged and publicized. \nThis dictionary offers two different types of browsing: \u201eBrowse by \nletter\u201f takes the user to the first entry for the letter clicked. It presents a \nsequence of entries varying in number according to their length, and users \ncan either click through each page in turn up jump ahead to locate a specific \nalphabetical range. \u201eWord list\u201f offers an alphabetical list of all headwords, \nand these are grouped to facilitate movement through the list: \u201e#, A, B,\u201f \u201eC, \nD,\u201f \u201eE, F, G,\u201f and so on. The search facility, powered by \u201eGoogle Custom \nSearch,\u201f located 176 results for \u201ecut\u201f including all headwords containing this \nsequence of letters and also all entries including this sequence anywhere in \ntheir content. Each one is headed \u201eThe Online Slang Dictionary,\u201f followed \nby a description: \u201eDefinition of cut,\u201f \u201eWords meaning muscular,\u201f or \n\u201eDefinition of \u201ecut out the robot.\u201f There is a fair amount of background \nnoise. For example, custle is located as a result for \u201ecut\u201f only because cut \noccurs after custle in the word-list: at the bottom of each page there is an \nautomatic link to the previous and next word. \u201eDefinition of [search term]\u201f \nis always presented first, but although a search for \u201ecut\u201f locates cuts, cutter, \ncutting, and cuttin, these highly relevant results may well be lost among the \nless relevant ones. The software is intelligent enough to recognize that cuttin \nand cuttin\u2019 are equivalent forms and that cutter is a valid result for the \nsearch \u201ecutters,\u201f but, as we shall see below, this does not help us with \nvariant spellings. \n Summary \n \nOnline slang lexicography offers various technological advantages over \npaper publication, ranging from user feedback to live links, images, and \nsound files, but not all online dictionaries take full (or any) advantage of \nthese possibilities. The dictionaries discussed here illustrate a number of key \npoints about the practical aspects of online lexicography. First, it must be \nfinanced: these websites all either host advertisements or are themselves \npart of an online dealership. Several have also produced paperback books \nand other merchandise. Second, they require considerable time for setting \nup and maintenance, and where this all falls on a single person other \ncommitments or interests may prevent the completion of the entire alphabet \nor the maintenance and updating of existing pages. In the case of the \nRegency Dictionary, progress through the alphabet appears to have been \nhalted; the Online Dictionary of Playground Slang is still available for \nsearching but is no longer updated. The work involved in monitoring the \nRap Dictionary was shared to ensure its survival. Third, although allowing \nusers to post directly online reduces the workload for the web-maintainer, it \nintroduces a range of issues that have to be spelt out in legally binding \ndocuments, particularly on the subjects of ownership, copyright, obscenity, \nand libel.  \nThese dictionaries also provide evidence of the current quality of \nonline lexicography. Allowing users to post material inevitably leads to \n\u201emission drift\u201f: the instigator of the dictionary may have a clear sense of \nwhat is or is not included within the remit of the dictionary, but users will \nnot necessarily be aware of this or in agreement with it. Even websites \nwhere only the editor can post material online are very variable in quality. \nAs far as it is possible to tell, none of these online lexicographers has any \nlexicographic training, or awareness of the tasks involved in effective \nlexicography, and few undertake any kind of background research. This \nmeans that inflected forms often occur as headwords, spelling variants \nabound, definitions are often imprecise or too specific, and etymologies are \ngenerally entirely speculative.  \nBoth Urban Dictionary and The Online Slang Dictionary set some \nof their entries apart by marking them as \u201eword of the day\u201f or as approved \nby the editor. This foregrounds amusing entries (Urban Dictionary) or \npresents an authoritative account of a word\u201fs usage (OSD). The challenge \nfor online slang lexicography is to find a way of editing or disregarding \nusers\u201f contributions without denying them the gratification of online \npublication and without jeopardizing the hit rate necessary for profitable \nadvertising. \nOnline lexicography also adopts a different stance with regard to \nquantity. There is no necessity for efficiency: contributors to user-written \ndictionaries do not generally check what is already there before they fire off \ntheir contribution, except perhaps in the wiki-written Rap Dictionary. Each \nof these websites makes its contents accessible in a variety of different \nways, and in each case the searching and browsing facilities operate \ndifferently. Without a detailed knowledge of the types of search they can \nperform and the variations inherent in the material, users cannot be sure that \nthey have located all the relevant information. Indeed, there is often so \nmuch information that most users would not want to wade through it all.  \n \n \nThe online dictionaries\u2019 coverage \n \nNotwithstanding their variable quality and their disparate adoption of the \ntechnological possibilities of online publication, these slang dictionaries do \nhave one major advantage over traditional paper publications: they can be \nupdated regularly and often. Putting aside the Regency Dictionary, which \ndoes not cover contemporary slang, this section will consider how far these \nonline glossaries provide us with better slang coverage than is otherwise \navailable. \n \nMethodology \n \nIn order to explore the coverage of these online dictionaries, it was \nnecessary to select a list of terms. Since the online dictionaries considered in \nthis section do not aim to include historical material, only terms in current \nuse are of interest for this purpose. These were identified by cross-referring \nbetween the OED, Green (2008), and various dictionaries compiled by \nBritish and American students following courses on slang lexicography \n(Eble 1991; McCreary et al. 2001; Coleman 2005). Although terms listed in \nmore than one of these sources were preferred, I have also used classroom \ndiscussion to determine whether terms listed in only one of these sources \nwere widely used. Terms were selected to represent British and American \nusage and while some have been in use for several decades, others are \nrelatively recent. Thirty-six terms were selected in all, twelve for which I \nhad evidence only of British usage, twelve for which I had evidence only of \nAmerican usage; and twelve for which I had evidence of usage in Britain \nand America. Some of these initial classifications were challenged by \nreference to the online dictionaries. As Tables 1-3 demonstrate, it is unlikely \nthat increasing the sample size would have had a significant effect on the \nresults. \n \nTerms documented in British but not American usage \nallow it interj. \u201elet it go; don\u201ft make a fuss\u201f (Leicester 2008 + 2009) \narse vb \u201eto be motivated to do something.

This represents one hit per 290 of \nits entries. None of the terms restricted to British usage was listed, and only \ndigits of the terms believed to be restricted to American usage (though \nevidence from one of the other dictionaries suggests that it is actually \ntransatlantic). The other three were all widely used transatlantic slang: \ncheesy, hottie, and veg out. \nThe Online Dictionary of Playground Slang had a hit rate of 31%, \nrepresenting one hit per 328 of its entries, with four additional terms \nincluded in citations but not defined in their own right, sometimes allowing \nthe discerning user to deduce their meaning. Although it implicitly \nconcentrates on slang used in schools in Britain, this dictionary\u201fs coverage \nof transatlantic slang was actually slightly better. Terms restricted to \nAmerican usage were least likely to be included, but chi-squared tests \nconfirmed that the differences between the three categories were not \nstatistically significant. \nA Dictionary of Slang scored a hit rate of 47%, representing one hit \nper 350 of its headwords. This dictionary explicitly focuses on slang and \ncolloquial usage in the United Kingdom, and its coverage of terms used in \nBritish is so much better than its coverage of terms restricted to the United \nStates (p=0.01) that we might consider its inclusion of digits and cheddar as \nindicative of their currency in the United Kingdom. \nThe Rap Dictionary is unlike the more general dictionaries, in that it \nrestricts itself to slang associated with a single subculture. Its hit rate was \n22%, representing one hit per 588 of its entries. The coverage of American \nand transatlantic terms is significantly better than the coverage of British \nterms (p=0.01), and this suggests that we might take its inclusion of allow \nit\/that as indicative of its currency in the United States. \nUrban Dictionary scored a 100% success rate, which would \nrepresent one hit per 120,316 of its entries were it not that many terms are \ndefined more than once. In fact, it is difficult to determine how many \nsubmissions there are for single meanings of a word because all senses and \ngrammatical categories are listed together for homographic headwords. The \nfigures are rendered even less useful by the frequent provision of separate \nheadwords for inflected forms and variant spellings. Chillax, for instance, is \nalso defined under chilax, chilaxen, chilaxin, chilaxing, chilaxn, chill-axe, \nchillaxn, chill-lax, chillak, chillax\u2019n, chillaxe, chillaxed, chillaxen, chillaxes, \nchillaxin, chillaxin\u2019, chillaxing, chillaxn, chillaxx, chillaxzen, chillaz, and \nperhaps under other less predictable variants as well. However, bearing all \nthese reservations in mind, and taking only uninflected forms and the most \nobvious spelling variant into account, there are a total of 212 submissions \nfor the 12 British slang terms: an average of 18 submissions per term. 402 \nsubmissions for the 12 American slang terms produce an average of 34 \nsubmissions per word. For the terms used on both sides of the Atlantic, there \nare 698 submissions in total, 58 submissions on average per term. Although \nhardly conclusive, this would bear further investigation. It suggests that the \nnumber of submissions for a term on Urban Dictionary bears some relation \nto its distribution and frequency of use. \nThe Online Slang Dictionary listed 25 of the 36 terms, a success rate \nof 69%, representing one hit per 536 of its entries. Its coverage of terms \nused in the United States is significantly better than its coverage of terms \nrestricted to British usage (p=0.01), which identifies blag, coolio, minger, \nand trollied as possible candidates for wider usage. The mapping function \non this website makes it possible to explore whether any speakers in the \nUnited States had claimed that they used these terms, and this did prove to \nbe the case for coolio and minger, but not for blag or trollied. \n \nDistribution \nUsing these dictionaries\u201f evidence in its totality allows us to reconsider the \ndistribution of a number of terms. Although minger is certainly British in \norigin, Online Slang Dictionary users report its use in the United States and \nwith 58 submissions on Urban Dictionary it is better represented than most \nterms restricted to British usage. The inclusion of allow it\/that in Urban \nDictionary does not provide any evidence of its distribution, but it is also \nfound in the Rap Dictionary. It is more likely to have originated in Black \nAmerican usage and spread to Britain than the other way round. 37 \nsubmissions for coolio on Urban Dictionary support the evidence from The \nOnline Slang Dictionary that it is not just restricted to Britain. \nAmong the terms originally classified as restricted to the United \nStates, it appears that chedda(r), digits, po-po, and possibly jones also have \n(or have had) some currency in British slang. This emphasizes the fluidity of \nslang usage in the age of the internet: British and American English have \nlong acquired terms from one another through music, film, and television, \nbut the internet has sped up the process. Where once a British slang term \nmight have remained obscure to an American teenager (and vice versa), its \nmeaning is now available at the click of a mouse, making its passage into \nwider usage smoother than ever. Printed dictionaries labelling terms as \u201eUS\u201f \nor \u201eBrit\u201f are unlikely to remain accurate for long, which begs the question of \nwhether it is possible to use the \u201eUS\u201f and \u201eBrit\u201f labels with any confidence \nor to construct dictionaries of \u201eBritish\u201f or \u201eAmerican\u201f slang as separate \nentities. \n \nMeaning \nAlthough the definitions in these online dictionaries are generally not \naccurately or carefully written, they can provide useful source material to a \ndiscerning lexicographer. For example, the term merk\/murk appears to be \nused only with the sense \u201eto defeat, insult or humiliate (someone)\u201f in British \nEnglish at the moment, but reference to the various online definitions \nsuggests that it is used with the sense \u201eto kill; to murder\u201f in the United \nStates, and that the sense of \u201eto defeat\u201f was originally restricted in reference \nto computer games, where defeating someone generally does involve killing \nthem. This appears to be the context in which the term passed into British \nusage, where it has acquired a broader meaning that is not reflected in the \nUnited States. \n \nOrigins \nAlthough these dictionaries could not be used as an example of scholarly \nlexicography, they do sometimes provide clues that a more discerning \netymologist could follow up. For example, both Urban Dictionary entries \nfor tinternet suggest that it represents a stereotypical Northern British \nelision of \u201ethe internet.\u201f One suggests that it was popularized by Peter Kay, \na comedian from Bolton in Lancashire, and Kay\u201fs official website does \ninclude an admonition to \u201cget on t\u201finternet.\u201d \n \n \nConclusions \n \nThe online slang dictionaries discussed in this paper are extremely variable \nin content, functionality, quality, and coverage. They do not generally fulfil \nthe requirements of traditional dictionary users in terms of content, quality \nor reliability. They can, however, serve a number of functions that \ntraditional dictionaries cannot: at their best, they offer dated evidence of \nuse; define the most current usages; and document debates between slang \nusers. They also offer information that slang lexicographers can use as \nsource material to determine frequency, distribution, origins, and semantic \ndevelopment. They are not by any means efficient lexicons, but for anyone \nseeking the meaning of a current slang term, these online slang dictionaries \nare the obvious place to start. Sometimes quantity delivers where quality \ncannot, but the ideal online slang dictionary would bring professional \nstandards of lexicography to users\u201f contributions without alienating \nenthusiastic but untutored informants. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAtoon, P. and Janssen, N. 1999-.
