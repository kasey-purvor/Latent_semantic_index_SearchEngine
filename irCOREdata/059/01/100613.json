INTRODUCTION\nWurtzite GaN-based alloys have attracted strong interest\nfor optoelectronic applications, in particular the development\nof blue and UV light emitting diodes \u0001LEDs\u0002 and laser di-\nodes. The introduction of indium is significant due to the\nconcomitant carrier localization and enhanced radiative\nquantum efficiency. However, the alloy nature leads to sig-\nnificant compositional disorder, which causes major broad-\nening of the optical spectra. The lattice mismatch between\nInN and GaN also leads to strain induced spontaneous and\npiezoelectric polarization fields near the interface of a het-\nerostructure and results in a quantum confined Stark effect\n\u0001QCSE\u0002. This spatially separates the electron and hole in\nconfined systems and reduces the optical transition strength.1\nWe report on two-pulse photon-echo experiments on low\nindium concentration, InxGa1\u2212xN multiquantum wells\n\u0001MQWs\u0002 as a function of well thickness and excitation wave-\nlength. Time-domain techniques have been extensively em-\nployed to study InxGa1\u2212xN structures, although for the most\npart these have concentrated on time-resolved photolumines-\ncence studies.2 Pump-probe techniques have also been used\nto study carrier relaxation and some of these studies have\ndemonstrated quantum beats due to impulsive excitation of\nacoustic phonons.3,4 Previous degenerate four-wave mixing\n\u0001DFWM\u0002 spectroscopy in III-V nitrides has mostly concen-\ntrated on GaN epilayers where exciton dephasing times,\nexciton-exciton, exciton-impurity scattering, electron-\nphonon, and exciton-biexciton interactions have been\nstudied.5\u20138 Typically, dephasing times of \u00031\u20132 ps are mea-\nsured.\nInxGa1\u2212xN epilayers and MQWs represent a highly inho-\nmogeneously broadened system and excitonic resonances\ncan be difficult to observe directly in a linear absorption\nspectrum. Our experiments reveal a pulse length limited,\nDFWM signal in both epilayers and MQWs. The measured\nsignals are resonantly enhanced at the ground and excited\nstates heavy-hole exciton absorption frequencies, yielding\nwell-resolved resonances against the suppressed background\nof continuum states. From the dependence of the DFWM\nsignal upon the intensity of the incident beams, it is con-\ncluded that the results may be strictly described in terms of\nthe third-order optical susceptibility. We have used the reso-\nnant nature of these signals to determine the position of ex-\ncited states in quantum wells of different thicknesses, yield-\ning good agreement with model calculations.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe samples consisted of ten-period In0.11Ga0.89N\/GaN\nMQWs. In all cases, the barrier was 7.5 nm thick, and the\nquantum well thicknesses were varied between 1, 4, and\n8 nm. All investigated samples were grown on \u00010001\u0002 sap-\nphire double-polished substrates by metalorganic chemical\nvapor deposition \u0001MOCVD\u0002. The substrates were initially\ntreated in H2 ambient at 1170 \u00b0C, followed by the growth of\na 25 nm thick low-temperature \u0001550 \u00b0C\u0002 GaN buffer layer\nand a 1.5 \u0002m thick layer of nominally undoped GaN grown\nat a high temperature. Afterwards, the temperature was low-\nered to grow a ten-period MQW. The photoluminescent \u0001PL\u0002\nspectra were excited with a He\u2013Cd laser, dispersed in a\n0.75 m monochromator and detected with a GaAs photomul-\ntiplier tube. Photoluminescence excitation \u0001PLE\u0002 spectra\nwere obtained using a Xenon lamp with wavelength\nselectivity\/tunability provided by a 0.25 m monochromator.\nTime-resolved spectroscopy was performed using a Ti-\nSapphire oscillator yielding 150 fs pulses, tunable between\n700 nm and 1 \u0002m at a repetition rate of 80 MHz. To excite\nthe interband transitions of InxGa1\u2212xN alloys, the oscillator\noutput was frequency doubled, providing the required exci-\ntation wavelengths between 350 and 450 nm. The DFWM\nmeasurements were performed in a standard two-pulse, non-\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 73, 165309 \u00012006\u0002\n1098-0121\/2006\/73\u000116\u0002\/165309\u00015\u0002\/$23.00 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society165309-1\ncolinear \u201cforward box,\u201d four-wave mixing geometry with the\nphase matched signal detected in the \u00042k2-k1\u0004 direction,\nwhere k1 and k2 are the wave vectors of the echo-generating\npulse sequence. The maximum available energy of the \u201cdi-\npole inverting\u201d k2 pulse was 0.47 nJ with the k1 pulse held at\nan energy of 0.024 nJ. Both beams were focused using 5 cm\nfocal length CaF2 lenses onto the sample position, yielding a\nspot diameter of close to 50 \u0002m. The signal was detected\nusing a photomultiplier and a phase-sensitive detection\nscheme.\nIII. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS\nFigure 1 shows the 10 K PL and PLE spectra of the three\nMQW samples. The PL spectrum for all samples shows a\nsingle-dominant peak at 3.25, 2.98, and 2.90 eV for the 1, 2,\nand 8 nm MQWs, respectively. By contrast, the PLE spec-\ntrum of the 1 nm thick sample shows one clear peak corre-\nsponding to the ground state hh1-e1 excitonic transition in\nthe QW with some evidence for higher energy transitions.\nThe PLE spectra for the 4 and 8 nm thick MQW samples\nreveal only a broad, structureless increase in absorption with\nno resolved features, which would be indicative of excitonic\nresonances. For the wider wells, a large shift of the PL from\nthe onset of the quantum well interband absorption is ob-\nserved. This shift results from a combination of the QCSE\nand exciton and carrier localization effects caused by indium\ndisorder fluctuations.9 It is significant that for the 4 nm and\n8 nm thick MQWs samples, the PLE shows no absorption\ndue to states close to the PL energy. This is due to a larger\nspatial separation of ground state electrons and holes in the\nwider wells and therefore weaker oscillator strengths of those\ntransitions, which results in their suppression in PLE spectra.\nThe featureless PLE spectra of the 4 and 8 nm MQWs arise\ndue to the contribution of the excited states, which are sig-\nnificantly broadened due to their enhanced sensitivity to both\nwell width and electric field fluctuations. This behavior is in\ncontrast to GaAs quantum wells, which in the absence of\nelectric fields display stronger broadening for narrow wells\ndue to well width fluctuations.10\nIn our two-pulse DFWM experiments, the observed signal\nfrom all samples consists of a very fast, pulse length limited\ntransient. In Fig. 2, the time-integrated \u0001TI\u0002 DFWM signal is\nplotted as a function of the time delay between the generat-\ning pulses for the 8 nm thick sample. Transients are recorded\nfor different energies of the k2 pulse with the k1 pulse energy\nkept constant at 0.024 nJ. The inset to Fig. 2 shows the in-\ntensity dependence of the DFWM signal at zero delay on a\nlogarithmic scale; the data are fitted well with a line having a\nslope of 2, showing that we are within the \u0003\u00013\u0002 limit. The\nvery fast dephasing we observe is an order of magnitude\nfaster than that observed in GaN epilayers.5\u20138 The fast\ndephasing times observed are most likely attributable to the\nalloy disorder, which leads to a disorder induced dephasing11\nthat is dependent on high indium concentrations. An addi-\ntional contributing factor may be carrier escape tunneling,12\nwhich can take place due to the built-in electric field in\nInxGa1\u2212xN\/GaN MQWs.\nFIG. 2.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 73, 165309 \u00012006\u0002\n165309-2\nWe have also performed a study of a 100 nm thick\nIn0.1Ga0.9N epilayer. We found a pulse limited time-\nintegrated DFWM signal that is enhanced at the epilayer\nband-edge energy \u0001see Fig. 3\u0002. The wavelength dependence\nof the DFWM signal observed in the epilayer shows a single\npeak whose intensity increases rapidly from the low-energy\nside, with a shoulder on the high-energy side reflecting the\nspan of the free-exciton splitting influenced by the band gap\nbowing in InxGa1\u2212xN. This result indicates that DFWM in\nInxGa1\u2212xN systems is enhanced at the excitonic states of the\nsystem, a result we show is fully borne out by the measure-\nments on the QWs.\nFigure 4 shows DFWM signals measured at different ex-\ncitation wavelengths \u0001for the three QW samples discussed\nabove\u0002 with a fixed excitation density of 6.4 \u0002J \/cm2. These\nare plotted together with the normalized PL and PLE spectra\nfor each of the samples. Surprisingly, given the broad fea-\ntureless nature of the PLE for these samples, the DFWM\nresults show clear resonances at specific wavelengths. Con-\ncentrating on the results for the 1 nm thick sample to begin\nwith, it is immediately evident that the nonlinear signal is\nresonantly enhanced at the lowest e1-hh1 transition of the\nquantum well. Hence we conclude that the enhancement of\nthe DFWM signal at a specific wavelength indicates the po-\nsition of the excitonic energy levels in the QW. The DFWM\nsignal is also observed to increase just below the barrier en-\nergy, which may arise either from a shoulder of strong\nDFWM signal from the GaN epilayer, or from the presence\nof a QW state nearly resonant with the barrier band edge in\nthe PLE spectrum.\nFor the wider wells, the DFWM spectra are more complex\nwith a number of overlapping transitions observed. Such rich\nstructure is suggestive of the observation of excited state\ntransitions within the wells. There is no signal detected for\nwavelengths close to the PL peak wavelengths in both the 4\nand 8 nm thick samples. This is due to the pronounced quan-\ntum confined Stark effect \u0001QCSE\u0002 in the wider wells, leading\nto weak wave-function overlap for the e1-hh1 transition. The\nkey observation is that clear and distinct resonances can be\nTABLE I.

The k \u00b7p Hamiltonian em-\nployed, including strain and band mixing effects, is described\nin detail in Refs. 13 and 14. To calculate the energy levels\nand optical matrix elements, we used the plane-wave expan-\nsion method.14,15 We used both 8\u00068 and 4\u00064 models; the\n4\u00064 model is obtained from the 8\u00068 model by taking the\nspin-orbit splitting \u00043=0. Since for InN and GaN this split-\nting is very small \u0001\u00043=4.6 meV, see Table I\u0002, in Fig. 5 one\ncan see that both models give very similar results \u0001in the 8\n\u00068 model we obtain a small additional splitting of the order\nof \u00043 for some of the transitions; for the purposes of the\npresent paper this splitting is not important\u0002, so we present\nhere the results obtained from the 4\u00064 model. Recently, we\nhave shown that the uncertainty in both the elastic and pi-\nezoelectric constants leads to a significant inaccuracy in cal-\nculated transition energies.16 The electric field was taken as\nan adjustable parameter in order to fit the QW ground state\ntransition to our PL data with a reassuring \u201cStokes\u201d shift of\nless than 80 meV. The values employed in our calculations\nof 1.2, 1, and 0.45 MV\/cm for the 1, 4, and 8 nm MQWs,\nrespectively, are consistent with the findings of Ref. 17,\nwhere a reduction of the electric field was found with in-\ncreasing well width. Table I shows the numerical values of\nthe material constants used in the k \u00b7p band calculations for\nunstrained materials, and are taken from Ref. 18, unless oth-\nerwise indicated. The alloy properties of InxGa1\u2212xN are ob-\ntained by linear interpolation except for the energy gap,\nwhere the relation from Ref. 19 is used.\nIn Fig. 4, the vertical gray lines indicate the results of the\ncalculation with the line height representing absorption\nstrengths of the relative interband transitions for each of the\nsamples, while their spectral position represents the transi-\ntion energy. The calculation of the 1 nm QW transition en-\nergies shows the presence of only the ground state exciton\ntransition at an energy of 3269 meV, while a more complex\nstructure is observed for the 4 and 8 nm QWs. As we can see\nfrom Fig. 4, the simulation gives good agreement for all\nstudied QW samples, proving that the peaks in the DFWM\ntrend indicate the position of high oscillator strength transi-\ntions \u0001see Table II for details\u0002. In the 1 nm QW sample the\npeak in the DFWM signal corresponds to the ground state\ne1-hh1 transition and yields a single intense resonance. For\nthe 4 nm QW sample, the calculated transitions are red-\nshifted by approximately 35 meV from the experimental\nDFWM signal peaks; however, the general trend is similar\nand the relative intensities approximately correct. For the\n8 nm thick sample, the situation is more complex due to the\nmultitude of possible transitions \u0001Fig. 4\u0002. It is clear that for\nboth the 4 and 8 nm MQWs the DFWM spectra are deter-\nmined by excited state transitions, the ground state transi-\ntions being unobservable due to their very weak oscillator\nstrengths.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 73, 165309 \u00012006\u0002\n165309-4\nlations indicate that the resonances observed in the DFWM\nexperiments reflect excitonic transitions within the quantum\nwell. The MQWs systems we have investigated have a com-\nplex valence band structure,2,20,21 which are nonisotropic,\nnonparabolic, and semidegenerate. Thus for the wider wells\nit is impractical to label all of the transitions. The essential\npoints to be made are: \u0001i\u0002 the DFWM spectra indicate the\nposition of excited states in the quantum wells, \u0001ii\u0002 the spec-\ntra are shaped by strong oscillator strength transitions even\nthough the precise assignments cannot be considered defini-\ntive, and \u0001iii\u0002 the wider wells do not show transitions from\nlow-lying quantum well states due to the low oscillator\nstrength of transitions arising from those levels.\nEarly studies on GaAs QWs \u0001Refs. 22 and 23\u0002 revealed\nthat DFWM signals in quantum wells are generally domi-\nnated by excitonic contributions and that this is primarily due\nto the large ratio of the exciton to free-carrier dephasing\nrates. These early reports concluded that DFWM experi-\nments performed with short pulses \u0001\u0003100 fs\u0002 always mea-\nsure signals due to excitons even when more free carriers\nthan excitons are created, since the longest dephasing time\nalways dominates. This is the case even if the exciton is only\nweakly excited by the tail of the pulse. The presence of a\nlarge number of potential scattering states facilitates fast\ndephasing of the continuum states in GaAs QWs and this\nyields bigger contrast in the relative dephasing rates. In fact,\nin Ref. 22, a 300:1 excitonic resonance was observed. In our\ncase the DFWM experiment picks out localized states with a\nlonger dephasing time from \u201cless localized\u201d states. Thus,\ncontrary to GaAs, InxGa1\u2212xN MQWs DFWM signals repre-\nsent the selective excitation of more heavily localized states\nfrom the distribution that is available, and discriminates\nagainst the broad background of \u201ccontinuum\u201d states with\nshorter dephasing times.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nTo summarize, we have performed two-pulse DFWM ex-\nperiments on InxGa1\u2212xN\/GaN MQWs which reveal pulse\nlength limited, transient signals. We have observed a reso-\nnant enhancement of the DFWM signal at specific wave-\nlengths. Calculations confirm that these signals correspond to\nexcitonic transitions within the quantum wells. The spectral\ndependence of DFWM provides an alternate way to investi-\ngate excited state levels in nitride quantum wells with dis-\ncrimination against the free-carrier continuum, information\nthat cannot be obtained using PLE from the highly inhomo-\ngeneous InxGa1\u2212xN MQWs.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work has been supported by the EPSRC through\nGrant Nos.
