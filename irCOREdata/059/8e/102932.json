DOI: 10.1371\/journal.pgen.0020072\nIntroduction\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause\nof death in industrialised countries, and the prevalence is\nincreasing dramatically in developing countries. The various\nclinical diagnoses that comprise CAD (e.g. angina, myocardial\ninfarction [MI]) are caused by atherosclerosis, a pervasive\ndegenerative condition in which lipid and \ufb01brous matrix is\ndeposited in arterial vessel walls to form atheromatous\nplaques. The \ufb01brous caps of some of these plaques sited in\ncoronary arteries may be unstable and rupture. This will\nrelease thrombogenic material into the lumen of the vessel\nleading to coronary thrombosis, vessel occlusion, and\nsubsequent infarction of the myocardium, a critical condition\nwith high mortality. While much is known about CAD, and\nabout some aspects of the underlying pathology of athero-\nsclerosis, new strategies for risk predication and intervention\nare still needed. There thus remains considerable importance\nin increasing our understanding of CAD pathophysiology.\nFamilial clustering of CAD has long been recognised [1],\nsuggesting a genetic contribution to susceptibility for this\ncondition. Studies of rare Mendelian forms of CAD have\nshown how mutations in genes involved in low-density\nlipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein metabolism\/homeo-\nstasis can cause premature CAD, but these mutations are\nthought to explain a relatively minor fraction of familial\nCAD. The majority of CAD is believed to be multifactorial\nwith a substantial genetic component. For instance, long-\nterm follow-up of monozygotic and dizygotic twin cohorts\nhave estimated the heritability of fatal coronary events as\n57% and 38%, respectively, for men and women [2]. More-\nover, there is accumulating evidence from epidemiological\nstudies that the genetic component of CAD risk is only\npartially explained by classic risk factors that are themselves\nknown to be heritable [3\u20135].

These \ufb01ndings\nare unsurprising, as studies of the pathophysiology of\natherosclerosis have shown the importance of pathways\ninvolved in in\ufb02ammation and innate immunity [6,7]. Con-\nsequently, the intriguing possibility exists that identi\ufb01cation\nof susceptibility genes might highlight novel biological\npathways involved in atherosclerotic plaque formation and\/\nor rupture, providing opportunities for prevention and\ntherapeutic intervention. On the other hand, susceptibility\nmight be determined principally by novel genes involved in\nwell-known pathways (e.g. cholesterol metabolism). These\npossibilities have motivated large-scale genetic projects to\nmap and identify susceptibility genes for CAD in an unbiased\nmanner with respect to gene function.\nPublished genetic linkage studies have implicated several\nloci for CAD. The \ufb01rst such linkage study was from Finland\nand showed linkage of premature CAD to loci on Chromo-\nsomes 2q21.2\u201322 and Xq23\u201326 [8]. Subsequent studies from\nGermany reported linkage to Chromosome 14q32.2 [9], from\nIceland to Chromosome 13q12\u201313 [10], from the United\nStates in the GENECARD study to Chromosomes 3q13 and\n5q31 (with linkage in subgroups to Chromosomes 1q25, 7p14,\n19p13) [11] and another U.S. study to Chromosome 1p34\u201336\n[12]. The Icelandic locus was replicated in population-based\nstudies from Iceland and England, with different haplotypes\nof the ALOX5AP gene (encoding 5-lipoxygenase activating\nprotein) associated with CAD in the two countries, and the\nIcelandic haplotype was also associated with stroke in Iceland\nand in Scotland [10,13]. The Chromosome 2 linkage identi\ufb01ed\nby the BHF Family Heart Study [14] was also detected in two\nprevious studies [8,12], and provides a promising region for\nfurther investigation.\nThe status of CAD loci which have not been replicated is\nless clear. Differences in the population studied and\/or in the\nselection criteria used might result in selection for different\ngenetic effects in this heterogeneous disorder. However, the\nlack of replication might also be expected given that most of\nthese linkage studies had rather low power relative to the\nanticipated effect size of CAD susceptibility genes. The\npublished linkage screens have ranged in size from 156\u2013\n1,933 families (;200\u20132,400 ASPs) and the linkage statistics\nreported have sometimes been suggestive rather than of \ufb01rm\ngenome-wide signi\ufb01cance, suggesting that some postulated\nloci may be false positives. None of the published studies have\nhad the statistical power to replicate a speci\ufb01c locus. Rather,\nthe signal-to-noise ratio is such that these studies have had\nborderline power to detect individual susceptibility genes, and\nso each will tend by chance to identify a different selection.\nThe PROCARDIS study was founded as a European\ncollaborative project to assemble a suf\ufb01ciently large number\nof families to map the modestly sized susceptibility genes that\nmight plausibly be hypothesised to contribute to CAD risk.\nWe present here the results of the \ufb01rst phase of the study, a\nlinkage study of 2,658 ASPs from 2,036 families with multiple\nCAD siblings.\nResults\nAffected sibling pairs (ASPs) were identi\ufb01ed in the families\nby applying two phenotypic criteria: 1) a broad CAD\nde\ufb01nition of disease status in the affected sibling(s), (i.e. MI,\nsymptomatic acute coronary syndrome [SACS], chronic stable\nTable 1.

The aetiology of CAD is complex with a substantial\nheritable component. Although there is a huge knowledge-base\ndetailing many aspects of the underlying pathophysiology of CAD, it\nis likely that undiscovered pathways exist. Positional cloning\nprojects can identify novel susceptibility genes; in the first step\ngenome-wide linkage screens are used to assign loci to specific\nchromosomes.\nThe authors have collected 2,036 CAD families from four European\ncountries, in order to maximise the power of detecting genes that\nconfer modest risks. A genome-wide linkage scan identified three\npromising regions for intensive study; one of the linked regions\n(Chromosome 17) was confined to families with multiple cases of\nmyocardial infarction and was replicated in a second independent\nseries of families. In addition the linkage scan confirmed a previously\nidentified locus on Chromosome 2. These results demonstrate that\nnovel CAD susceptibility genes are tractable to positional cloning\nwhich promises to lead to the identification of new molecular\ninsights into this condition, and hopefully, new treatments.\nangina or coronary revascularisation at age , 66 y), with each\nASP containing at least one proband with MI or SACS, or 2) a\nnarrow de\ufb01nition of disease based on a clinical history of MI\nat age , 66 y. Table 1 shows the country of residence of the\nASPs in addition to the number of full- and half-siblings\ncon\ufb01rmed or identi\ufb01ed in a RELPAIR [15] relationship\nanalysis. Overall 5% (133\/2,658) of the ASPs were reclassi\ufb01ed\nas half-sibling pairs. A further 70 individuals were excluded\nfrom analysis as they were apparently unrelated (55 individ-\nuals) or possibly distantly related (15 individuals) to the\nrecorded family structure.\nWe \ufb01rst undertook an initial genome-screen (Figure 1) for\n1,464 CAD ASPs (Figure 1A) and 739 MI ASPs (Figure 1B)\ngenotyped with 446 microsatellite markers. Three regions of\ntentative linkage were identi\ufb01ed by multipoint linkage\nanalysis using the MLSix programme on Chromosomes 3\n(CAD phenotype, log of the odds [LOD]\u00bc 1.52), Chromosome\n11 (CAD phenotype, LOD \u00bc 1.66), and Chromosome 17 (MI\nphenotype, LOD \u00bc 2.85). The genome-wide signi\ufb01cance of\nthese statistics (i.e. allowing for the multiple signi\ufb01cance\ntesting inherent in a genome-screen) was estimated by\ncomputer simulation as p \u00bc 0.81 (CAD, Chromosome 3), p \u00bc\n0.71 (CAD, Chromosome 11) and p \u00bc 0.08 (MI, Chromosome\n17). These results were supported by an alternative multi-\npoint linkage analysis method using the Merlin programme\n(see Figure S1 for detailed results). For instance, the Merlin\nanalysis showed linkage to the MI phenotype on Chromosome\n17 (LOD\u00bc 3.19; location\u00bc 61 cM;\u00011 LOD support interval\u00bc\n41\u201377 cM).\nIn order to further test the potential importance of the loci\nidenti\ufb01ed in the linkage analysis, these regions were tested in\nan additional sample of 1,194 CAD ASPs and 344 MI ASPs\n(details shown in Table 1). Table 1 shows that families\nrecruited in the United Kingdom were over-sampled in the\nFigure 1.

Additional grid-tightening markers (eight markers\non Chromosome 3, seven markers on Chromosome 11, and 25\nmarkers on Chromosome 17) were included to maximise the\nrecovery of identity-by-descent information for these regions.\nFigure 2 summarises the results of these replication experi-\nments. There was insigni\ufb01cant evidence of linkage on\nChromosome 3 to the broad CAD phenotype (p\u00bc 0.056), with\na peak LOD \u00bc 0.7 mapping 11.9 cM outside the \u00011 LOD\nsupport interval identi\ufb01ed in the genome-wide screen (Table\n2). There was no evidence for linkage to Chromosome 11 in the\nbroad CAD replication cohort. In contrast, the MI suscepti-\nbility locus on Chromosome 17 showed signi\ufb01cant evidence\nfor linkage (p \u00bc 0.003) at location 67 cM (Table 2). After\nallowance for multiple testing of three independent hypoth-\neses generated in the initial genome-wide screening phase of\nthe experiment, the linkage to Chromosome 17 was signi\ufb01cant\n(p \u00bc 1 \u2013 (1 \u2013 0.003)3 \u00bc 0.009) [16]. Table 2 shows maximum\nlikelihood estimates and 95% con\ufb01dence intervals (CI) for the\nrecurrence risk ratio (ksib) associated with the linked region on\nChromosome 17 for MI phenotype. The linked region was\nfurther investigated in the replication cohort with CAD (1,194\nASPs); there was weak support for linkage between Chromo-\nsome 17 and the broad CAD phenotype (p\u00bc0.156). Finally, an\nanalysis of the combined data from the genome-wide screen\nand replication cohorts showed linkage to the MI phenotype\non Chromosome 17 (LOD \u00bc 2.68; location \u00bc 69 cM; \u00011 LOD\nsupport interval\u00bc 63\u201379 cM).\nAn exclusion analysis (Figure 3) was performed for CAD\n(Figure 3A) or MI (Figure 3B) ASPs by calculating the largest\nksib at each genetic location associated with a LOD of\u00012 [17].\nUsing this strict exclusion criterion, 85% of the autosomal\ngenome was excluded for a locus-speci\ufb01c effect of ksib\u00bc 1.24\n(CAD phenotype) and ksib \u00bc 1.42 (MI phenotype).\nDiscussion\nSusceptibility genes for human complex diseases are\nbelieved to confer modest risks and hence genetic linkage\nto such loci may be dif\ufb01cult to replicate. So our \ufb01nding that a\nregion of tentative linkage to the MI phenotype identi\ufb01ed on\nChromosome 17 in a genome-wide screen (p \u00bc 0.08) was\nreplicated in an independent cohort of families (p \u00bc 0.009,\ncorrected for multiple comparisons) is important and\nprovides a target for further positional cloning studies.\nIt is well known that estimates of genetic effect sizes from\ngenome-wide screens are frequently upwardly biased [18] and\nthat more realistic estimates can be obtained in independent\nreplication cohorts. Table 2 provides estimates of the genetic\neffect size (and their 95% CI) associated with linkage to\nChromosome 17 that were obtained by a bootstrap re-\nsampling procedure. The peak LOD obtained in the genome-\nscreen was at map location 50.7 cM which was associated with\nan effect ksib \u00bc 1.21; in the replication data, the effect size\nestimated at the same location was considerably smaller (ksib\n\u00bc 1.04). The LOD \u00011 support interval for localising the MI\nsusceptibility gene in the genome-wide screen was broad (42\u2013\n79 cM) which is typical for complex diseases [19]. The peak\nLOD in the replication dataset reassuringly falls within this\ninterval at location 67.0 cM (ksib at this position was 1.29 in\nthe replication cohort).\nAs the linked region on Chromosome 17 appears to be\nspeci\ufb01c for the MI phenotype, with no evidence for linkage to\nthe broad CAD phenotype in the replication set of ASPs (p .\n0.156), it is important to consider the possible reasons for this\nFigure 2.

Current knowledge of the pathophysiological\nprocesses that lead to CAD indicate that they are highly\ndiverse, and to a large extent not understood in full detail. In\naddition the CAD disease entity is heterogeneous, consisting\nof four major diagnostic outcomes: MI, angina, unstable\nangina, and coronary revascularisation events [20]. There is\nconsiderable overlap between these outcomes, yet they differ\nsigni\ufb01cantly in their underlying pathophysiology. Coronary\nartery atherosclerosis forms the basis for all four disease\nevents, yet MI and unstable angina require a further step of\nrapid deterioration in coronary artery blood-\ufb02ow. This last\nstep is, in addition to atherosclerotic build-up, determined by\na complex interplay between factors such as plaque stability,\nin\ufb02ammatory response, platelet function and the coagulation\ncascade [21]. A modest level of atherosclerosis can be\nsuf\ufb01cient for some individuals to suffer an acute coronary\nevent, but others with severe coronary artery stenosis never,\nor only late in life, suffer a clinically detectable MI. An\nunderstanding of how this kind of phenotypic, and poten-\ntially genotypic, heterogeneity affects our linkage results is\nimportant when analyzing large sets of data [22]. Further\nstatistical evaluation, including ordered subset analysis and\nquantitative-trait linkage analysis, could be usefully applied\nto promising linked regions in this and other genome screens.\nThus, different sets of CAD patients will plausibly differ\nsigni\ufb01cantly in their linkage results, a conclusion supported\nby the fact that few of the loci in the CAD linkage studies\npublished hitherto overlap with each other [8\u201312,14].\nThe region of linkage to MI in the present study, \ufb02anked by\nmarkers D17S921 at 17p11.2 (40 cM; genomic position\n14,170,191 in the National Centre for Biotechnology Infor-\nmation 35.1 assembly) and D17S787 at 17q21 (79 cM; position\n50,637,083), spans the centromere and includes over 36\nmegabases of DNA containing over 300 genes of known\nfunction and about as many again predicted genes. This\ninterval contains numerous genes that are plausible candi-\ndates for involvement in CAD, therefore our future research\nis focused on re\ufb01ning the region genetically by means of high\ndensity SNP coverage, using the PROCARDIS case-control\ncollection and our trio families, and by an analysis of\nquantitative trait loci (QTL) for CAD intermediate pheno-\ntypes measured in the affected sib-pair families. There are\npublished QTLs close to this region that may provide clues.\nFor example, two QTLs for low-density lipoprotein choles-\nterol map just outside the PROCARDIS region to 17q23.2\u2013\n25.3 [9] and 17q24.2\u201325.3 [23]. In familial combined hyper-\nlipidemia pedigrees, a QTL for apoB at 17p11\u2013q21 [24] is\nwithin our mapped region, as is a QTL affecting low-density\nlipoprotein peak particle diameter at 17q21.33 [25].

The lack of\nevidence for other linked loci suggests that the heritable\ncomponent of coronary artery disease and MI may be\ncomposed of many genes, with few of them having suf\ufb01cient\neffect to permit mapping by genetic linkage even in studies of\nthis size involving thousands of affected sibling pairs.\nMaterials and Methods\nFamily collections. Ascertainment criteria for PROCARDIS pro-\nbands were MI or SACS, on the assumption that the latter represents\na similar pathological process according to modi\ufb01ed World Health\nOrganisation diagnostic criteria [28,29] before the age of 66 y [30].\nDiagnosis of MI required documentation of two or more of: (a) typical\nischemic chest pain, pulmonary oedema, syncope or shock; (b)\ndevelopment of pathological Q-waves and\/or appearance or disap-\npearance of localized ST-elevation followed by T-wave inversion in\ntwo or more standard electrocardiograph leads; (c) increase in\nconcentration of serum enzymes consistent with MI (e.g. creatine\nkinase more than twice the upper limit of normal). Diagnosis of SACS\nrequired documentation of hospitalization for one of the following\nindications: (a) unstable angina diagnosed by typical ischemic chest\npain at rest associated with reversible ST-depression in two or more\nstandard electrocardiograph leads; (b) thrombolysis for suspected MI\n(as indicated by localized ST-elevation in two or more standard\nelectrocardiograph leads) even without later development of T-wave\ninversion, Q-waves, or a signi\ufb01cant enzyme rise; or (c) emergency\nrevascularization (i.e. during same admission) following presentation\nwith typical ischemic chest pain at rest. Probands completed\nquestionnaires in order to recruit affected siblings with a range of\nCAD diagnoses at age , 66 y (MI, SACS, chronic stable angina, or\nintervention for coronary revascularization), who were then invited\nto participate in the study if their diagnoses were con\ufb01rmed. Parents\nand up to four unaffected siblings per family were recruited wherever\npossible to augment the recovery of linkage phase information.\nInformative families were recruited in Germany, Italy, Sweden, and\nthe United Kingdom; 99.5% of the study participants reported having\na white European ancestry. The protocol was approved by the Ethics\nCommittees of the participating institutions and all participants gave\nwritten, informed consent.\nDNA extraction and microsatellite genotyping. DNA was extracted\nfrom 9 ml EDTA-anticoagulated samples of frozen whole blood using\nGentra Systems PUREGENE kits (Flowgen, Lich\ufb01eld, United King-\ndom) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and its concen-\ntration determined \ufb02uorimetrically using SYBRt Green. DNA was\nplated and genotyped for the ABI MD10 (Applied Biosystems,\nWarrington, United Kingdom) set of microsatellite markers using\nABI 3700 capillary sequencing equipment [31]. All microsatellite\ngenotyping was carried out at Oxagen Limited (Abingdon, Oxford-\nshire, United Kingdom). Genotyping was carried out blind of pedigree\nstructure and disease status. Genotypes were called using the\nautomated functions within the ABI Genotyper software andmanually\nchecked independently by two operators. All discrepancies were\nreviewed and re-genotyped if no consensus call was made. Following a\nrelationship analysis (see below), genotypes were checked for\nMendelian inconsistencies [32]. After a further round of re-genotyp-\ning, any remaining inconsistent genotypes were \ufb02agged as \u2018\u2018missing\u2019\u2019\nand removed from any subsequent analysis. The accuracy of genotyp-\ning can be estimated in 19 pairs of siblings that, after relationship\nanalysis, were proven to be monozygotic twin-pairs. 5,741\/5,759\n(99.7%) of their genotypes were concordant. For these 19monozygotic\ntwins, no genotypes were \ufb02agged as \u2018\u2018missing\u2019\u2019 during QC.\nAdditional grid-tightening markers were genotyped for the linked\nregions on Chromosomes 3 (eight markers), 11 (seven markers), and\n17 (25 markers); details are included in Table S1. A total of 15\nmarkers (MD10\u00fe grid-tightening markers) were completely excluded\nfrom further analysis following QC analysis.\nStatistical analysis. Genetic relationships between cognate relatives\nwere con\ufb01rmed in an analysis using the RELPAIR program [15] with\nall genotyped microsatellite markers. If sibling pairs were found to be\nconsistent with being related at the half-sib level, their family\nstructures were revised and included in subsequent analyses.\nIndividuals found to be unrelated to their recorded family were\nexcluded from all subsequent analyses. Any remaining inconsistent\ngenotypes were subsequently marked as missing. Two further grid-\ntightening markers were eliminated as they showed excessive non-\nMendelian inheritance and Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium. The\ngenetic map for all of the genome-screen and majority of the grid-\ntightening markers was extracted from the Rutgers sex-averaged map\n[33]. The Rutgers map is an integrated genetic map in which physical\nsequence data was used to establish marker order; genetic map\ndistances were estimated by maximum likelihood methods using\nmeiotic mapping data from Centre d\u2019Etude Polymorphism Humaine\nand DeCode genotype databases. The locations of \ufb01ve grid-tightening\nmarkers absent from the Rutgers map were linearly interpolated with\nrespect to \ufb02anking markers that were included in the Rutgers map.\nNon-parametric linkage analysis was undertaken using the com-\nputer program MLSix, to compute single-point and multi-point\nmaximum LOD score (MLS) statistics [34,35] for affected full and half\nsib-pairs [17]. For autosomal loci, two parameters were included to\nmodel additive and dominance effects on susceptibility, and LODs\nwere maximized under the \u2018\u2018possible triangle\u2019\u2019 constraints [34]. For X-\nlinked loci, LODs were maximised under analogous linear constraints\n[36] for same or mixed-sex full-sibs and informative half-sibs\n(maternal half-brothers and half-brother-sisters and half-sisters).\nASPs drawn from affected sibships of size \u0002 2 were equally weighted\nin the MLS calculations. All ASPs include at least one affected sib,\ncomplying with the PROCARDIS proband de\ufb01nition (MI or SACS at\nage , 66 y). Identity-by-descent vectors for the full and half-sib pairs\nfor each sibship were calculated by the Merlin program [37], using the\n\u2018\u2018minx\u2019\u2019 version of the program for X-linked data. Marker allele\nfrequencies were estimated by gene counting pooling information\nacross the four countries and across genome-screen and replication\ncohorts where available. In regions of linkage, the peak LOD is\nassociated with a measure (recurrence risk ratio in full-siblings\u0001ksib)\nof the genetic effect size for this susceptibility gene; 95% CI for this\nksib estimate were calculated using a bootstrapping technique with\n1,000 replicates [38]. Exclusion analysis was performed using MLSix;\nthe maximization function was modi\ufb01ed to estimate the ksib\nassociated with a MLS \u00bc \u00012 (a strict exclusion threshold) at each\ngenetic location. This analysis is able to show in regions that show\nlittle or no evidence of linkage, that there is suf\ufb01cient identity-by-\ndescent information to con\ufb01dently exclude susceptibility genes of\nmodest effect sizes. The statistical signi\ufb01cance of the MLS statistics\nwere established by a computer simulation which modeled the family\nstructures (including the patterns of missing parental genotypes and\nthe small proportion of families with more than two affected sibs),\nmarker density and informativity [17]; 1,000 replicates of a complete\ngenome-wide screen were simulated. To interpret the signi\ufb01cance of\nthe MLS statistic in the genome-wide screen (i.e. allow for multiple\ntesting), the number of MLS statistics greater than desired threshold\nacross all chromosomes was recorded. To interpret the signi\ufb01cance of\nthe MLS statistic in the replication experiment, the number of MLS\ngreater than desired threshold at a one location (i.e. one test at one\nspeci\ufb01c location) was recorded.\nThe authors had full access to the data and take responsibility for its\nintegrity.
