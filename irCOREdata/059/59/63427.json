The familiar paper journals and books of \nthe geoscience literature are being supplemented, and some supplanted, by electronic \nversions offering new facilities. Geoscience repositories gain efficiency and flexibility \nin storage, management, access and presentation of data. Global standards help \ncommunication, sharing of facilities, integration of ideas, collaboration and delegation \nof decisions. An example from geological mapping illustrates how a broad view of \ncomputer methods leads, not just to better ways of delivering the same product, but to \nmore fundamental improvements in expressing, sharing and generalizing the \ngeologists' conceptual models.  Familiarity with existing systems can blind us to their \nshortcomings: familiar methods may hide assumptions that are no longer relevant. \nThe example suggests that maps, reports and supporting evidence can be linked by \nhypertext in a tightly connected model. Targeted distribution of appropriate, up-to-\ndate information can replace the high-cost scattergun approach of conventional \npublication. This leads to a tentative identification of user needs. \n \nKey Words - Electronic publication, global standards, digital cartography, conceptual \nmodel, user requirement. \n \n \n1. The geoscience literature \n \nGreater efficiency often shows up as reduced cost. Some figures, quoted by a fact-\nfinding mission of the European Commission (Goldfinger, 1996), therefore deserve \nsome thought. They refer to the costs of a banking transaction, such as paying a bill or \ncashing a check, in the USA. Using a full service branch, a typical cost was $1.07; \nusing telephone services $0.54; using Automated Teller Machine full service $0.27; \nusing Personal Computer banking $0.015; and using the Internet World Wide Web \n$0.01. The authors point out that non-banking organizations, such as supermarket \nchains, can enter the banking field at low cost through the Web and can cherry-pick \ndesirable customers from the traditional banks.  \n \nThe costs are spectacularly reduced by removing the need to rely on manual records, \nthe buildings to house them and staff to run them. Customers can control the \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part B  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \ntransactions through an automated process from their own desktops. No routine \nsupport is needed from the supplier. Although some customers may pine for the \nmarble halls and the human touch, the inconvenience of going to the bank and lining \nup for service is avoided. It is not difficult to draw analogies with obtaining \ngeological information through the Internet, as opposed to purchasing traditional \npublications or visiting libraries or archives. Customers bear the small cost of printing \nthe information on their own desktop printers, but have the opportunity to review it \nfirst on screen and benefit from the rapid delivery. \n \nThere has been wide discussion of the consequences of information technology for \nscholarly publication. Useful entry points are the work of Varian (1994) on the future \nof electronic journals, and the bibliography maintained by Bailey (1996). Odlyzko \n(1994, 1996) quotes some figures which give an idea of the scale of the costs. The \nnumber of publications in earth sciences has for some time been doubling every 8 \nyears. Commercial publishers see a new journal as successful with as few as 300 paid \nsubscriptions. Harvard University spends some $58 million a year on all its libraries. \nSubscription costs are about one third of total library costs, much of the remaining \ncost being associated with storing and managing books, serials and catalogs that are \nduplicated in numerous other libraries. To publish a scientific article in mathematics, \nOdlyzko estimates the research costs at $20 000, preparing and reviewing the paper \nanother $5 000, and publication costs $4 000. The average number of readers for each \narticle is about 20 (possibly less in geoscience). He suggests that if library users were \nasked to cover the publication costs by putting $200 into a meter in order to read one \narticle in detail, or $20 to skim the contents, readership might fall. Instead, the costs \nare almost entirely concealed from the user.  \n \nHigh-energy theoretical physics is one area where new delivery systems are in place. \nWithin a year of Ginsparg (1996) introducing a system, most communication of pre-\nprints in that field moved from paper to electronic communication. The main benefits \nare convenience, immediate worldwide availability, and the opportunity to comment \nand discuss.  \n \nEarth Interactions (Hepner et al., 1998), the on-line journal of the American \nGeophysical Union, the American Meteorological Society and the Association of \nAmerican Geographers, offered a different rationale. It was launched for scientific \nrather than economic reasons. \u201cThe problem with you publishers is you think you add \nvalue. Well, you don\u2019t. You force me to reduce the information in my scientific \npapers so that they will fit on a flat printed page.\u201d The journal articles are refereed \nrapidly by e-mail and published on the Web. They offer such features as hyperlinks, \nanimation, virtual reality, links to large datasets in external archives, \u201clive \nmathematics\u201d, interactive 3-D display, forward references (that is, to later citations of \nthe paper), linked comments and replies, and corrigenda. It is intended to become \nfinancially self-supporting and the editors believe that: \u201cthe availability of \nauthenticated peer-reviewed scientific articles for future scientists requires an income \nstream from the users. Furthermore, the marketplace will help to sort out the useful \nfrom the chaff.\u201d After an initial subsidized trial period, the editors expect to obtain \nrevenue from author and subscription charges, similar to their print journals. Their \npreparation costs (as opposed to publication and library costs) are at least as high as \nfor a print journal. \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part B  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nOdlyzko (1996) suggests that the major displacement of conventional publication will \noccur between 2000 and 2010. When it happens, he expects the change to be abrupt. \nThe kudos of publication in electronic journals must then match that of their printed \ncounterparts. Computer-mediated communication is likely to replace much print \npublication because of the lower publication and library costs, and because of the \nimproved representation of scientific findings, increased flexibility and ease of use. IT \npromises quicker access to more appropriate and up-to-date information at lower cost. \nAlongside the development of new methods that take full advantage of these \nopportunities, the backlog or legacy information (existing documents from earlier \ntechnology) must remain an integral part of the changing information system. As \ndescribed in part L, section 3, much printed literature is also available as an electronic \ncopy. \n \n2. Managing a knowledge base \n \nTechnical journals are concerned with publishing self-contained articles on a wide \nrange of topics. Commercial and state organizations, such as oil companies or \ngeological surveys, have a different objective - systematically collecting and \nmaintaining geoscience information to support specific activities. This calls for a \ndifferent approach to IT. The British Geological Survey (BGS) is an example of a \nmedium-sized survey. \u201cThe BGS is the UK's foremost supplier of geoscience \nsolutions and is active in areas such as land-use planning, waste disposal, \nhydrocarbons exploration, civil engineering, minerals extraction, contaminated land, \nseismic and geohazard evaluation and understanding climate change\u201d (BGS, 1998). A \nprimary concern of BGS is therefore the management of a comprehensive knowledge \nbase for a well-defined geographical and subject area. \n \nBGS currently prepares and publishes a comprehensive set of geoscience maps and \nreports for the UK and surrounding seas, largely the results of its own surveys. \nExtensive archives of supporting information are held for consultation, including \nmuch information of variable quality from external sources. The archives take many \nforms, such as data files, field notes, borehole records, logs, charts, photographs, \nvideos, sketches, thin sections, fossil specimens, satellite and aircraft imagery, \nreferences to external sources of information, including papers, sources of expert \nadvice, and so on. In addition to the publications, many of the archived records are \npublicly accessible for inspection on site. \n \nThe integrated collection of linked information can be handled more efficiently with \nIT. Low-cost storage in computer databases makes it possible to archive and index \ninformation, including some results of field survey, in a readily accessible form. The \nindexes support off-site searching of the archive. Compound electronic documents \ncombine text and map information, and link it to images illustrating detail and \npointers to additional evidence. Flexible retrieval and presentation can provide output \ncustomized for a wide range of users (see J 1.8), as in Fig. 1. A well-structured \ndatabase with full metadata (H 3) is a basis for publication on demand. Knowledge, \nhowever, still remains largely in the heads of experts. They must understand the \nusers\u2019 needs, as well as the content and structure of the information, to interactively \ncontrol selection and output. As customers are best placed to understand their own \nrequirements, the system should in time offer them direct access. \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part B  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \n  \n \nFig. 1. Printed compound electronic document. Geological information relevant to the potential \npurchaser of a property is assembled in the BGS Address-Linked Geological Inventory. It is retrieved \nfrom various databases and GIS. The material is then edited, and provided to the customer on screen or \non paper. A small section of an online report is shown here. British Geological Survey \u00a9NERC. All \nrights reserved.

Sharing information \n \nIT should simplify the sharing of information. Yet a computer user may need to learn \nnew techniques for every new application or change to the system. Even within an \norganization, different groups may tend to work independently, selecting their own \ncomputing tools and their own structure and format for storing data. Users may spend \nmore time transforming data than solving geoscience problems. Sharing data between \norganizations adds further complexity. \n \nA cross section of oil companies addressed this issue by creating the Petrotechnical \nOpen Software Corporation (POSC) as a not-for-profit corporation in 1990. \u201cThe \nstandards and open systems environment to be facilitated by POSC represent a \nmaturing of the industry that frees companies from worrying about the integration of \ntheir computer systems and lets them concentrate on areas of added value\u201d (POSC, \n1993). Although specifically addressing the requirements of the Exploration and \nProduction business, it adopts existing standards where possible, developed further as \nnecessary. It makes decisions through an open process supported by technical \narguments, not commercial or special interests. Its work is made available to all, and \nis relevant to a wide area of geoscience. In addition to POSC, there are many other \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part B  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nactivities and groups promoting standards in related areas. The short-term costs of \nstandardization cannot always be justified by putative long-term gains, and many \nstandards have been superseded before being widely adopted. Nevertheless, the \nimplementation of standards and better links through the Internet are gradually \novercoming the artificial barriers to communication. \n \nThe oil industry is establishing shared computer repositories where any of the \nsubscribing companies can access the data. Because they are run by specialists, the \nrepositories provide better and more secure facilities. Because they are collaborative \nventures, they reduce duplication of effort in systems development, data collection \nand storage. Because the data meet agreed standards, they can readily be retrieved and \nanalyzed by the subscribers. The quoted savings are immense.  \n \nThere are other gains. The standards create a larger single market and so justify higher \ninvestments in developing applications software. The consistency of data collected to \nuniform standards pays dividends in such areas as quantitative analysis, visualization \nand database management (see parts F, G, H). Standard procedures and content also \nsimplify project planning. Effort can be put into genuinely new investigations rather \nthan reinventing and documenting old ideas. Global standards (L 6) simplify \nexchange of data across boundaries of discipline, organization and place.  \n \nIT means that scientists can themselves prepare documents, such as letters, \nmemorandums and reports. This includes keyboard entry, preparing and inserting \ndiagrams, selecting content and layout by inspection on screen, and reusing earlier \nwork in new contexts (C). A computer template prepared by a graphic designer can \nensure a uniform house style. In an academic community, lecture notes, student \nappraisals, and examples can be accessed more widely and more readily.  \n \nProject management is also helped by computer communication. Larger groups can \ncollaborate effectively through rapid dissemination of planning documents, schedules \nand progress reports. Fewer layers of management are needed, because the \ninformation is available to all (M 3.1). Potentially, improved sharing of information \noffers more freedom of action to individuals, with more intelligence at their fingertips. \nMany of the benefits of IT are missed, however, if they are sought in too narrow a \ncontext, as the following example of geological mapping illustrates. \n \n4. The need for a broad view \n \nAn information system is a means of recording ideas and sharing information. \nGeoscientists, for excellent reasons, tend to take their information system for granted, \nand may consequently give little thought to a basic need for improvement. Modern \ninformation technology, appropriately applied, makes the system more effective and \nefficient. There are many examples of computer applications that make a valuable \ncontribution to part of the geoscience information system. To gain the full benefits, \nhowever, it is necessary to look at the system as a whole. Analysis of a system \ngenerally starts with a specification of the user requirement, but this can prove hard to \ntie down. For example, a study that I shall now describe began with a small, familiar \npart of the system and ended by pointing to some unrecognized requirements.   \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part B  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nIt was my privilege, many years ago, to study some fine examples of conventional \ngeological maps. The maps are informative, attractive, accurate. The organization \nwhich produced them strives to respond to customer demands. My objective was to \nlearn by comparison how the poor daubs then coming off the computer printer might \nbe improved. With modern technology, the aim must be not just an imitation, but a \nbetter product. To detect areas of possible improvement, it may help to consider how \ninformation was transformed during the process of mapping. \n \nThe information available to the geologists as they strode across the landscape, \nhammers at the ready, is very different to that which reached the final published map \non which they signed their names. The geology, in its infinite diversity, has been \nreduced to areas with uniform colors corresponding to a small set of mappable units. \nThis categorization of objects, that is the things or entities of interest in the current \ncontext, is a basic part (taxonomy) of the scientific method (J 2.1). Objects with \nsimilar attributes are grouped into named classes (grass, sheep, rocks), thus enabling \none to make general statements about them and codify one's expectations about their \nproperties and behavior. Not only can we talk about them, but in this case, can also \nshow the distribution of classes of geological objects on a map. A dual statement is \nbeing made: the rocks designated on the map by a specific color have been identified \nas belonging to a particular formation; the formation comprises in part the rocks at the \nlocations shown by the appropriate color on the map. We need to consider next, \nhowever, how adequately the map reflects the ideas in the minds of the surveyors. \n \n4.1 Extending the language \n \nWe generally know more than we are able to express and share with others.  Where \ntechnology allows us to express ideas in new ways, it can improve our ability to \nunderstand and share knowledge. The depiction of geology on the map is subject to \ncartographic constraints. Thicknesses of lines are chosen to be legible, boundaries are \nmoved apart to be distinct, lines smoothed to avoid visual clutter, and so on. These are \nsecondary to the interpretation in the field, which must surely have involved aspects, \nsuch as consideration of three-dimensional processes, which cannot be shown on the \nmap. The geologists can therefore be said to have developed a conceptual model - a \nformalized mental image giving a simplified view of relevant aspects of the real \nworld. The full conceptual model exists only in the minds of the authors, and must be \nfurther simplified for representation on the map. \n \nThe completed map is a permanent, shareable, public record of the authors\u2019 ideas. \nHowever, it necessarily imposes physical constraints on the representation of the \nconceptual model. The technical limitations of pen and paper are significant. Lines of \neven thickness and areas of uniform color are easily drawn, but artistic genius is \nneeded to accurately depict our imperfect view of diversity, ambiguity and \nuncertainty. The limitations of our skills and tools force us to reduce the complexity \nof nature to a few mappable units.   \n \nOur mental images of objects are strongly influenced by their representation.  Make a \ncareful schematic drawing of a fossil, and it may be easier to remember the drawing \nthan details of the original specimen. Draw firm boundaries on a map and they affect \nyour view of the geology. The rock bodies are three-dimensional, and can be fully \nunderstood only in terms of the processes by which they originated and developed \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part B  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nthrough geological time. The map is two-dimensional, supplemented by \ncross-sections, indications of the geometry such as orientation measurements (strike \nand dip), intersections with the topography, and possibly contours on a subsurface \nhorizon. We have a view of the vertical relationships along the lines of cross-sections, \nwith a rather hazier view in between. Ink marks on static, two-dimensional paper \ncannot represent satisfactorily a complex sequence of three-dimensional units and \ntheir spatial relationships, far less their origin and structural history. \n \nA map at a uniform scale cannot accommodate the variation of information density on \nthe ground. For example, the geological information for a map sheet may be limited to \na few good coastal exposures with little solid geology exposed inland. A map which \nfully reflected this would have a thin zone of illegible clutter relieving the blank \nmonotony of the rest of the sheet. If the main objective of surveyors in the field is to \nproduce a map, therefore, they may give limited attention to the detail of good \nexposures, knowing that there is no room to show the results on the map. Again, the \nphysical limitations of the medium influence the conceptual model, and thus the \ninvestigational procedure. \n \nThe ink marks on the map depict formalized symbols, such as stratigraphic codes, \nwhich do not imitate the appearance of the original objects, and patterns, such as \nformation boundaries, which are miniaturized versions of patterns on the ground, or, \nrather, in the geologists' conceptual model. The process of moving from observation \nin the field to representation on a map involves generalization, that is, showing the \nsalient features, possibly in a simplified form, and removing unnecessary detail (see \nButtenfield and McMaster, 1991). When a smaller-scale map is produced for the same \narea, the original map is again generalized. The latter process can be readily studied \nwith the aid of an enlarging photocopier. Fig. 2 indicates differences between features \ndrawn at the scale of the original survey at 1:10 000 and as shown on the published \nmap at 1:50 000. This may also throw light on the generalization during field mapping \nand the aspects of the real world that are conserved during that process. \n \nThe dike swarms or the coal seams in Fig. 2 are obviously exaggerated in thickness \nfor legibility, and thus are not a true scaled reduction. Their exact numbers (actual or \nobserved) are not shown, although variations in numbers may be reflected in some \nway, and it is possible that the spacing or relative spacing is also indicated. Their \norientation is probably represented, and in a few cases their continuity and even \nvariation in thickness, but not their length.  An intricate pattern has been carefully \ndisplayed. Its exact meaning, however, is not immediately obvious. \n \nGeneralization resembles statistical sampling (F 3), in which a small number of items \nare selected to represent a larger whole. Generalization also reduces a large amount of \ninformation to a more manageable quantity that throws light on the overall situation. \nHere, the requirement is to be able to draw conclusions about the geology from the \nmap. Statisticians insist that in order to arrive at statistically valid conclusions an \nappropriate sampling scheme must be followed and explained to the user (see Davis, \n1973). The map in some ways resembles a sample, but what was the sampling \nprocedure? Take, for example, a symbol showing the orientation of bedding in Fig. 2. \nIt may be representative of the orientation within either a particular area, or within an \noutcrop, or a horizon, or a pattern of folding. It may be a random sample, a typical \nvalue, a particularly significant value, or selected haphazardly. It may refer to an area \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part B  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nthe size of a field notebook, or it may not. Certainly it is not a measurement from \nwhich one could confidently draw quantitative conclusions. Lines on the map show \nformation boundaries and the positions of faults. But it is seldom clear where the \ngeologists observed their presence, or inferred it from landscape features, and where \nthey were required simply in order to complete the geologists' reconstruction.  Despite \nthe large scientific investment which the map represents, its content needs cautious \ninterpretation. Nevertheless, despite the absence of any recognizable sampling \nscheme, it is possible to learn much about the geology from a geological map. \n \n \n \n \n  (A)      (B) \nFig. 2. Map generalization . A: fragments of maps (on the left) at survey scale of 1:10 000. B: maps for \nthe same areas (on the right) generalized for publication at 1:50 000, enlarged here to the same scale for \ncomparison. The amount of information is progressively reduced during observation, recording, \nabstracting and reading. This generalization process can be observed in action during scale reduction of \na map. In the upper example (BGS Sheet 44W, Eastern Mull) geometrical properties of the dike swarm \ninclude average orientation, lenticularity, variation in density, dimensions and spacing. Some of these \nat least were affected by generalization. In the lower example of scale change (BGS Sheet 31W, \nAirdrie) minor faults were removed, coals seams selected, and the orientation of the coal seam adjusted \nto remove the effect of minor faulting. Presumably similar faults and coal seams exist that were too \nsmall to show at survey scale. British Geological Survey \u00a9NERC. All rights reserved.

Geoscience after IT: Part B  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nPerhaps the map is not an attempt at a precise geometrical depiction, but rather is \ntelling a story which geologists have been trained to understand. It is not difficult to \nimagine geologists in the field developing their own conceptual model, and using a \npre-existing map to check it against earlier observations and align their ideas with \nthose of their predecessors. Geologists who could themselves have done the earlier \nwork, know that particular marks are made under specific circumstances. By an \nintuitive process they could put themselves in the authors' shoes, project themselves \ninto the authors\u2019 minds and visualize the conceptual model that lay behind the \ndepiction on the map.  \n \nIntuition, that is apprehending something without any intervening reasoning process, \nis vital to science. You could not have read this far without it.  Human beings are \nskilled in intuition, computers are not. But that is not the end of the story. What \ngeologists show on a map is an inextricable mixture of hard fact and interpretation. \nWith computer support, the language of the map could be extended so that aspects of \nthe geometry, for example, could be rigorously sampled in the field, and the three-\ndimensional structure could be recorded and tested for consistency. But this is \npointless if the rigor is lost in the final portrayal. These issues are explored in more \ndetail in part G. Meantime, the point is that there is a hidden requirement for users to \nfree their ideas from the constraints of scale, dimensionality and cartographic \nrepresentation imposed by the paper map; to develop multiple conceptual models \nmore freely; and to express them more fully and rigorously in the shareable record. \nModern information technology can extend the means of expression and \ncommunication, but must be used with caution and awareness of the likely \nconsequences. \n \n4.2 Connectivity and integration \n \nDevising a solution to the narrow user requirement just outlined could have damaging \nand dangerous side-effects, like taking aspirin for the pain of a stomach ulcer. The \ngeological map is a small part of recorded geoscience information. Changes to one \npart can have knock-on effects elsewhere. For example, to obtain an account of the \ngeology, even of a mapped area, the user is likely to turn to a written report. Both map \nand report are expected to share the same conceptual model, and refer to the same \nobjects and object classes (H 5). One cannot be modified without affecting the other. \n \nThe map and the report are separate documents, possibly prepared at different times. \nSmall maps are likely to be included in the report, as well as diagrams providing \ngraphical information that might more naturally be part of the map. Many maps, on \nthe other hand, contain long text descriptions that could fit equally well into a report. \nThere is thus no sharp distinction of content between map and text material. They are \nseparated because the two widely different formats could not readily be printed as a \nsingle document. Cross-reference from report to map is by the tedious mechanism of \ngrid coordinates, and references from map to report are likely to be confined to a brief \nbibliography referring to the map sheet as a whole. For obvious reasons, no \nconventional document contains references to items published later than itself. The \nconnections between documents could clearly be improved. \n \nTo grasp the full significance of a geological interpretation, the user may have to visit \nthe area and retrace the investigation. After all, in any science there should be the \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part B  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \noption of checking conclusions by reexamining the evidence. Even where field notes \ncan be examined, however, there is little guidance to the precise reasoning behind the \nconclusions shown on the map or recorded in the report. Although providing an \ninvaluable context, published maps and reports may lack the specific information \nwhich is required for a detailed study, and give little indication of where that detail \ncan be found. Think, for example, of the civil engineer looking for records to assess \nthe foundations of a large building. If borehole records exist, they may have been used \nas supporting evidence in making the map, but neither explicitly cited nor evaluated. \nInformation technology should be able to offer better solutions to supporting, \nretracing and sharing the investigators' ideas. \n \nA surprisingly large part of most scientific papers is a reworking of earlier published \nmaterial, recast to explain or support the author's viewpoint, but involving a degree of \nrepetition that might be unnecessary if the original sources were more accessible. A \nsomewhat broader solution would therefore take advantage of the greater connectivity \nthat GIS and hypermedia (E 4) can offer, and thus the ability to integrate information \nfrom many sources. Material from the map, the report, diagrams, the database, \ncomputer applications, video and still photography, external comments, references to \nprevious work and access to expert opinion could all be incorporated in a fully \nconnected hyperdocument, using simple and familiar tools for access from the \ndesktop. It would be unwise, however, to embark on such a project without \nconsidering its long-term development and the means of disseminating the \ninformation. \n \n4.3 Deliver and print \n \nThe economics of the offset-lithography printing process affect both text publications \nand maps. Preparing the reproduction material is complex and requires scarce skills, \npossibly resulting in long delays. The costs of setting up a print run are comparatively \nhigh. Subsequently, each additional copy within the print run costs little more than the \npaper and ink. Some thousands of high-quality copies may therefore be printed in a \nbatch. Identical copies are bound, dispatched, documented and stored throughout the \nworld, in public, private and personal libraries. Interlibrary exchange schemes are \norganized to mail copies if they are not available locally. All this is to reach the \nhandful of users who may be interested. The printed product is a permanent snapshot \nof the author's ideas at a particular time. Revision is costly and therefore infrequent. \nThe information is likely in consequence to be out of date. \n \nThe geological map is complex and to the expert eye is full of information.  But there \nis tension between the scientists\u2019 desire to record all their insights and the demands of \nthe market place. Information to attract as many readers as possible may be included \nto justify the wide circulation, at the expense of clutter and complexity.  \n \nThe end-user of the map may be an expert in another field with limited training in \ngeology. Aspects of the geology may be important to the land-use planner zoning \nresidential areas, the construction engineer planning a new highway route, the \ninsurance agent concerned with geological risk to housing, the lawyer with a claim for \nground-water pollution, the teacher explaining landforms, the company director \nfinancing mining development. All have their own requirements for specific \ngeological information, which may or may not be available from the general map. \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part B  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nThey need a simple presentation of the information including relevant detail but free \nof clutter. One approach to meeting such needs is to prepare many thematic maps for \nthe same area, meeting a range of potential requirements. A result, however, is greatly \nincreased publication costs. A solution is to print on demand extracts selected from a \ngeographic information system (GIS), a computer-based system for handling map \ninformation (see Bonham-Carter, 1994). Parallel arguments could be made about text \nreports. \n \nBecause many maps are published to a standard set of scales, the geological map can \nbe overlain on a light table to correlate it spatially with other maps showing for \nexample topography, soils, or land use. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to find the \nmaps, their sheet boundaries may not match, there may be many small discrepancies \ndue to different series being revised at different times, and the map underneath is \nnever easy to read. GIS offers a solution in principle, seldom achieved at present \nbecause of the lack of availability of digital maps. \n \nThe geological map has been taken as an example, but is a small part of the recorded \ninformation on geoscience. Text publications share many of the same deficiencies. \nThe language in which the reports are expressed forces a particular pattern of thought, \nsuch as categorizing the diversity of nature in predetermined molds, which may not \nalways be the best option. A report of any kind is expensive and laborious to produce. \nIt therefore tends to present a rather tidy and self-contained account of its topic, \nomitting unsuccessful lines of investigation and details that may be informative but do \nnot contribute to the main theme.   \n \nNone of this implies incompetence, but rather that ways of working are influenced, \nperhaps controlled, by the available tools. Around these tools a major industry of \nintermediaries, such as publishers, printers, booksellers and librarians, has grown and \ncannot change overnight. Geoscientists are the beneficiaries of a huge legacy of \ninformation, recorded and greatly influenced by the technology of the time. Now, \ntechnology is moving on and the information industry is regrouping. It is feasible to \nhold information of many types under the control of the originators or their proxies, \nand to select and deliver it electronically worldwide when required, for local editing \nand printing of both images and text under the control of the user. In the words of the \nXerox Corporation, print-and-deliver is giving way to deliver-and-print.  \n  \n5. Towards a user requirement \n \nThere are incompatibilities and conflicts between the old and the new. Ways of \nthinking and ways of working that have been deeply ingrained over generations, may \nno longer be appropriate. We must consider not just the representation of existing \ndata, but also the more effective representation of reality. We must bear in mind that \nnew methods may bring risks of misunderstanding, which hidden features of \nconventional systems were designed to circumvent. The benefits we can expect from \nIT, and our objectives in using it, can be crystallized as a user requirement, a concept \ndescribed in more detail in K 3. An apparently narrow user requirement, as in B 4.1, \nmust be placed within its wider context. To the frustration of IT support staff, the user \nrequirement tends to evolve as new methods are explored, and may be clear only after \nthe work is complete. \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part B  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nIn general terms, the user requirement identified so far is to share information more \neffectively and efficiently by:  \n\u2022 more complete and rigorous representation of conceptual models and their \nsupporting evidence \n\u2022 reduction of repetition by better links \n\u2022 direct worldwide access to information that meets global standards \n\u2022 more appropriate control of information by originators and users, with less \nreliance on intermediaries \n\u2022 easier access to more rigorous analytical methods and visualization techniques \n\u2022 a move from fixed paper documents, to a shared, dynamic knowledge base, \nfrom which users can selectively retrieve and print information \n \nAt this stage, I hope you agree at least on the need for geoscientists to arrive at an \ninformed view of how we can best work with new information technology: informed \nby experience of the various tools that IT places at our disposal (parts C to H), and by \ninsight into how we think and work within the geoscience information system (parts I \nto M). \n \n6.
