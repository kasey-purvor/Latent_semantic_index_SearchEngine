Time series 17\t\r \u00a0\nrecorded within the boundary currents immediately upstream and downstream of the 18\t\r \u00a0\nmost significant outflow of AABW from the Weddell Sea indicate that raised outflow 19\t\r \u00a0\ntemperatures are synchronous with stronger boundary current flows. These changes 20\t\r \u00a0\noccur rapidly in response to changes in wind forcing, suggesting that barotropic 21\t\r \u00a0\ndynamics and the response of the bottom Ekman layer are significant. The observed 22\t\r \u00a0\nsynchronicity indicates that the previously-detected weakening of the export of the 23\t\r \u00a0\ncolder forms of AABW from the Weddell Sea need not be associated with a reduction 24\t\r \u00a0\nin the total flux of AABW exported via this route. These points need careful 25\t\r \u00a0\nconsideration when attributing the observed AABW warming in the Atlantic, and 26\t\r \u00a0\nwhen determining its contribution to global heat budgets and sea level rise. 27\t\r \u00a028\t\r \u00a0\n\t\r \u00a0 3\t\r \u00a0\nIntroduction 28\t\r \u00a0\n 29\t\r \u00a0\nThe Weddell Sea hosts the production of Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW), the 30\t\r \u00a0\nmain contributor to the cold Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) that permeates much 31\t\r \u00a0\nof the global ocean abyss [Orsi et al., 1999]. While AABW in the low-latitude 32\t\r \u00a0\nAtlantic is often taken as the ensemble of waters colder than 2 \u00b0C, WSDW itself has 33\t\r \u00a0\npotential temperatures between ~0 and -0.7 \u00b0C, and forms directly through intense air-34\t\r \u00a0\nsea-ice interaction at the periphery of the Weddell Sea, as well as via upwelling of 35\t\r \u00a0\nWeddell Sea Bottom Water [e.g. Gordon et al., 2001; Meredith et al., 2000]. It 36\t\r \u00a0\ncirculates cyclonically within the boundary currents of the Weddell gyre before being 37\t\r \u00a0\nexported across and around the South Scotia Ridge (Figure 1), with Orkney Passage 38\t\r \u00a0\n(OP) being the most direct throughflow for WSDW to enter the Atlantic overturning 39\t\r \u00a0\ncirculation [Naveira Garabato et al., 2002; Schodlok et al., 2002]. Around one quarter 40\t\r \u00a0\nof all dense Antarctic-derived waters colder than 0 \u00b0C flow through OP, after which 41\t\r \u00a0\nthey flow north and east across the Scotia Sea [Meredith et al., 2001; Meredith et al., 42\t\r \u00a0\n2008] and westward in a boundary current toward Drake Passage. They do not, 43\t\r \u00a0\nhowever, penetrate significantly into the Pacific [Nowlin and Zenk, 1988].  44\t\r \u00a0\n 45\t\r \u00a0\nIn recent decades, AABW has warmed significantly in many regions, most strongly in 46\t\r \u00a0\nthe Atlantic [e.g. Meredith et al., 2008; Zenk and Morozov, 2007]. This warming has 47\t\r \u00a0\nreached the North Atlantic, where it was interpreted as a slowing in the meridional 48\t\r \u00a0\noverturning of Antarctic-derived waters [Johnson et al., 2008]. The warming has a 49\t\r \u00a0\nmagnitude of potential significance for the global heat budget and calculations of sea 50\t\r \u00a0\nlevel rise [Purkey and Johnson, 2010].  51\t\r \u00a0\n 52\t\r \u00a0\n\t\r \u00a0 4\t\r \u00a0\nThere have been a number of investigations of variability of deep and bottom waters 53\t\r \u00a0\nin the Weddell Sea [e.g. Fahrbach et al., 2004; Schr\u00f6der et al., 2002], however the 54\t\r \u00a0\nabsence of clearly-defined trends in WSDW properties has focused attention on 55\t\r \u00a0\nprocesses that might control its characteristics as it exits the Weddell Sea. Based on 56\t\r \u00a0\nhydrographic data from the Scotia Sea, Meredith et al. [2001; 2008] proposed that 57\t\r \u00a0\nchanges in cyclonic wind-forcing over the Weddell gyre could impact on the 58\t\r \u00a0\nsteepness of isopycnal surfaces in the northern Weddell Sea, and hence on the 59\t\r \u00a0\ntemperature of the coldest water that crosses the South Scotia Ridge. Jullion et al. 60\t\r \u00a0\n[2010] used a more comprehensive data set, and found a surprisingly short lag (just a 61\t\r \u00a0\nfew months) between changes in wind stress curl over the Weddell gyre and 62\t\r \u00a0\ntemperatures of WSDW exported through OP. If such processes were relevant on 63\t\r \u00a0\ndecadal timescales, the observed strengthening of winds over the Southern Ocean 64\t\r \u00a0\n[e.g. Thompson and Solomon, 2002] could plausibly be responsible for the warming 65\t\r \u00a0\nof AABW in the Atlantic, due to the coldest classes of WSDW being progressively 66\t\r \u00a0\nrestricted from crossing the South Scotia Ridge [Meredith et al., 2008]. Here we 67\t\r \u00a0\npresent observational evidence and dynamical arguments concerning local controls on 68\t\r \u00a0\nboth the temperature and strength of the outflow of WSDW from the Weddell Sea, 69\t\r \u00a0\nand discuss the implications for large-scale water mass properties and ocean climate. 70\t\r \u00a0\n 71\t\r \u00a0\nData sources 72\t\r \u00a0\n 73\t\r \u00a0\nData were obtained from two in situ instruments, one in the northern Weddell Sea, 74\t\r \u00a0\nand one in the southern Scotia Sea (Figure 1). The former was the uppermost 75\t\r \u00a0\ninstrument on mooring M2 of the Consortium on the Ocean\u2019s Role in Climate: Abrupt 76\t\r \u00a0\nClimate Changes Studies (CORC-ARCHES) program [e.g. Gordon et al., 2010]. M2 77\t\r \u00a0\n\t\r \u00a0 5\t\r \u00a0\nwas deployed at 62\u00b038\u2019S, 43\u00b015\u2019W in water depth ~3059 m, with the uppermost 78\t\r \u00a0\ninstrument (a Sea-Bird SBE37 Microcat temperature\/conductivity recorder) located 79\t\r \u00a0\n2580 m below the surface. The latter was the Multi-Year Recording Tide Level 80\t\r \u00a0\nEquipment [MYRTLE; Spencer and Foden, 1996], a long-duration bottom pressure 81\t\r \u00a0\nrecorder deployed on the seabed at 60\u00b003\u2019S, 47\u00b010\u2019W (~2350 m depth) between late 82\t\r \u00a0\n1999 and late 2003. The MYRTLE temperature sensor was not calibrated for absolute 83\t\r \u00a0\ntemperature, so only anomalies are used; these are precise to 0.001 \u00b0C. We also use 84\t\r \u00a0\nwind stress data from the ERA-Interim reanalysis 85\t\r \u00a0\n(http:\/\/www.ecmwf.int\/products\/data\/archive\/descriptions\/ei\/index.html).   86\t\r \u00a0\n 87\t\r \u00a0\nResults 88\t\r \u00a0\n 89\t\r \u00a0\nMYRTLE and M2 temperature anomalies correlate well for much of their length with 90\t\r \u00a0\na lag of 120 days (M2 leading MYRTLE; Figure 2a), specifically during 2002 and 91\t\r \u00a0\n2003 for which the correlation at this lag (0.6) is significant at the 95% level. (Note 92\t\r \u00a0\nthat MYRTLE is scaled by 0.7 in Figure 2. M2 data were obtained from the 93\t\r \u00a0\nuppermost instrument on a long mooring, whilst MYRTLE data were obtained with a 94\t\r \u00a0\nbottom lander and hence came from closer to the core of the bottom-intensified 95\t\r \u00a0\nboundary current). For a path length between the two sites of ~500 km (Figure 1), this 96\t\r \u00a0\n120 day lag equates to a flow speed of ~4.8 cm s-1, somewhat less than the 7.9 cm s-1 97\t\r \u00a0\nquoted by Nowlin and Zenk [1988] for boundary current speeds at ~2000 m depth to 98\t\r \u00a0\nthe west of MYRTLE. However, considering the full period of data overlap suggests 99\t\r \u00a0\nthat ~4.8 cm s-1 may underestimate the true long-term mean. Specifically, during 100\t\r \u00a0\n2001, the lag of 120 days shows poor agreement between MYRTLE and M2 (Figure 101\t\r \u00a0\n2a), whereas 60 days yields significantly better agreement. (For this section of data, a 102\t\r \u00a0\n\t\r \u00a0 6\t\r \u00a0\n120 day lag gives a correlation of 0.2, compared with 0.55 for 60 days). This shorter 103\t\r \u00a0\nlag equates to a flow speed of ~9.6 cm s-1. For comparison, long-term current meter 104\t\r \u00a0\nrecords at M2 give a mean speed of 8.3 cm s-1 [Gordon et al., 2010], though no such 105\t\r \u00a0\ndata are available from M2 for 2001 itself. 106\t\r \u00a0\n 107\t\r \u00a0\nSignificantly, temperature anomalies during the period of shorter-lag correlation 108\t\r \u00a0\n(2001) were higher than those during the period of longer-lag correlation (2002 and 109\t\r \u00a0\n2003) (Figure 2). The length of the transition between these two periods is hard to 110\t\r \u00a0\nquantify precisely, but cannot exceed a few months (Figure 2).  111\t\r \u00a0\n 112\t\r \u00a0\nThe depths of M2 and MYRTLE data were different, at ~2580 m and 2350 m 113\t\r \u00a0\nrespectively. Recent multi-beam echo sounder data (not shown) give a sill depth of 114\t\r \u00a0\n~3600 m for the narrowest part of OP, and depths ~2500 to ~3350m along a shallower 115\t\r \u00a0\nridge immediately upstream. This indicates that WSDW passing the top of M2 can 116\t\r \u00a0\ncross the South Scotia Ridge relatively unimpeded, although it will sink and mix as it 117\t\r \u00a0\ndoes so. That the M2 and MYRTLE temperature anomalies show strong similarities 118\t\r \u00a0\nindicates vertical coherence in temperature, given this sinking and mixing and the 119\t\r \u00a0\nshallower location of MYRTLE compared with M2. 120\t\r \u00a0\n 121\t\r \u00a0\nDiscussion  122\t\r \u00a0\n 123\t\r \u00a0\nCoincident with the period of shorter-lag correlation between MYRTLE and M2, 124\t\r \u00a0\nzonal wind stress along the South Scotia Ridge was anomalously strong during the 125\t\r \u00a0\nlatter part of 2001 (Figure 2f, 2g, 3), with the end of this period matching closely the 126\t\r \u00a0\ntransition to the longer-lag relationship between MYRTLE and M2 (Figure 2a, 2c). 127\t\r \u00a0\n\t\r \u00a0 7\t\r \u00a0\nThis echoes the timescale of just a few months for the response of WSDW to winds 128\t\r \u00a0\nfound previously [Jullion et al., 2010]. Given the rapid and synchronous response of 129\t\r \u00a0\nWSDW temperature and speed to changes in forcing, we suggest that the key 130\t\r \u00a0\nmechanism involved is the response of the bottom Ekman layer to barotropic changes 131\t\r \u00a0\nin the strength of the deep boundary current that flows along the sloping topography 132\t\r \u00a0\nof the northern Weddell Sea.  133\t\r \u00a0\n 134\t\r \u00a0\nAs described by Garrett et al. [1993] and Brink and Lentz [2010] amongst others, any 135\t\r \u00a0\nalong-slope geostrophic flow over sloping topography gives rise to a bottom Ekman 136\t\r \u00a0\nlayer that displaces isopycnals away from their equilibrium depth and that is 137\t\r \u00a0\nultimately arrested by buoyancy forces. The arrest time for a downwelling-favorable 138\t\r \u00a0\nalong-slope geostrophic flow such as the deep boundary current in the northern 139\t\r \u00a0\nWeddell Sea (or, in other words, the time scale on which a change in the along-slope 140\t\r \u00a0\ngeostrophic velocity is balanced by an adjustment of the bottom Ekman layer) is 141\t\r \u00a0\nestimated by tarrest = 0.5 cd-1 N-1 S-3\/2, where cd is the frictional bottom drag 142\t\r \u00a0\ncoefficient, N is the buoyancy frequency, and S = N2 f--2 sin2\u03b8 is the Burger number 143\t\r \u00a0\nbased on the bottom slope (tan \u03b8) and the inertial frequency f [Garrett et al., 1993]. 144\t\r \u00a0\nUsing values typical for the northern Weddell Sea boundary current (cd \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 10-3, N 145\t\r \u00a0\n\u2248 10-3 s-1, f  \u2248 10-4 s-1, \u03b8 \u2248 2\u00b0, S \u2248 0.12), we obtain t arrest ~ 54 days, broadly consistent 146\t\r \u00a0\nwith the baroclinic adjustment time scale suggested by the observations. 147\t\r \u00a0\n 148\t\r \u00a0\nThat the bottom Ekman velocity anomaly associated with the adjustment process is 149\t\r \u00a0\nsufficiently large to produce the observed change in WSDW temperature may be 150\t\r \u00a0\nshown using the relationship between the Ekman layer velocity vEk and the along-151\t\r \u00a0\nslope geostrophic speed Ug, i.e. vEk = 2.5 cd1\/2 Ug, where the reduction in the Ekman 152\t\r \u00a0\n\t\r \u00a0 8\t\r \u00a0\nflow resulting from buoyancy effects has been neglected for simplicity [e.g., Brink 153\t\r \u00a0\nand Lentz, 2010]. An approximate halving of the boundary current speed from ~0.1 m 154\t\r \u00a0\ns-1 in the last 9 months of 2001 to ~0.05 m s-1 thereafter is suggested by observations, 155\t\r \u00a0\nimplying a reduction in vEk of ~6 \u00d7 10-3 m s-1. If such a reduced Ekman flow acted 156\t\r \u00a0\nadiabatically on a topographic slope \u03b8 \u2248 2\u00b0 over a time scale t arrest ~ 54 days, the 157\t\r \u00a0\nimplied uplift of isopycnals would be ~900 m, well in excess of the ~100 m suggested 158\t\r \u00a0\nby observations. In practice, this isopycnal displacement is a gross overestimate, due 159\t\r \u00a0\nto the assumption that the Ekman flow on the slope proceeds unimpeded by buoyancy 160\t\r \u00a0\nforces, and serves simply to quantitatively illustrate the plausibility of the proposed 161\t\r \u00a0\nmechanism of baroclinic adjustment. 162\t\r \u00a0\n 163\t\r \u00a0\nOther potential mechanisms do not seem able to explain our rapid synchronous 164\t\r \u00a0\nchanges in WSDW outflow temperature and strength. For example, at typical rates of 165\t\r \u00a0\nO(10 m y-1), local forcing by anomalous surface Ekman pumping \/ suction would take 166\t\r \u00a0\nseveral years to displace isopycnals vertically by ~100 m, the amount required to 167\t\r \u00a0\nchange the temperature of the coldest WSDW exported by the ~0.04\u00b0C observed [e.g. 168\t\r \u00a0\nGordon et al., 2001]. Further, changes in the formation properties of WSDW such as 169\t\r \u00a0\nhave been inferred [e.g. Fahrbach et al., 2004] are unlikely to have the rapid 170\t\r \u00a0\ntimescale that characterize the shifts in both temperature and flow speed that we have 171\t\r \u00a0\nobserved, nor are they likely to have such a short-period relationship to changes in 172\t\r \u00a0\nlocal atmospheric forcing. 173\t\r \u00a0\n 174\t\r \u00a0\nWe hypothesized previously that large-scale cyclonic wind forcing over the extent of 175\t\r \u00a0\nthe Weddell gyre may control the northward export of WSDW across the South 176\t\r \u00a0\nScotia Ridge [Meredith et al., 2001; 2008].\t\r \u00a0Our\t\r \u00a0new\t\r \u00a0observations\t\r \u00a0do\t\r \u00a0not\t\r \u00a0preclude\t\r \u00a0177\t\r \u00a0\n\t\r \u00a0 9\t\r \u00a0\nthis,\t\r \u00a0however\t\r \u00a0it is important to note that classical gyre-wide baroclinic adjustment at 178\t\r \u00a0\nhigh latitudes is characterized by time scales of decades [e.g., Anderson and Gill, 179\t\r \u00a0\n1975], which would result in a significantly longer response timescale than that 180\t\r \u00a0\nobserved here. We thus suggest that any comparatively slow changes in outflow due 181\t\r \u00a0\nto changes in large-scale cyclonic forcing will have more rapid (and potentially 182\t\r \u00a0\nlarger) changes superposed on them due to barotropic and Ekman processes near the 183\t\r \u00a0\noutflow itself. 184\t\r \u00a0\n 185\t\r \u00a0\nConclusions 186\t\r \u00a0\n 187\t\r \u00a0\nAABW in the Atlantic is warming rapidly, and determining the causes of this is 188\t\r \u00a0\nimportant if the implications for global heat budgets and sea level rise are to be 189\t\r \u00a0\ncorrectly quantified and understood. If, as has been suggested previously, the cause of 190\t\r \u00a0\nthis warming were a reduction in the northward export of the colder classes of 191\t\r \u00a0\nWSDW (as opposed to the same volume being exported with higher temperatures) 192\t\r \u00a0\nsuch calculations will need to account for this to avoid regional overestimates of heat 193\t\r \u00a0\ncontent and thermal expansion. Our findings support the notion of the colder classes 194\t\r \u00a0\nof WSDW being progressively restrained from leaving from the Weddell Sea, 195\t\r \u00a0\nhowever the synchronous nature of the temperature and export speed of WSDW in 196\t\r \u00a0\nresponse to changing winds adds significant further complexity. Specifically, it now 197\t\r \u00a0\nseems possible that a wind-induced reduction in the export of the colder classes of 198\t\r \u00a0\nAABW into the Atlantic overturning circulation can be associated with an increase in 199\t\r \u00a0\nthe export of the warmer classes. The balance between these factors in controlling the 200\t\r \u00a0\noverall export flux is presently unknown. 201\t\r \u00a0\n 202\t\r \u00a0\n\t\r \u00a0 10\t\r \u00a0\nSimilar to the AABW in the North Atlantic [Johnson et al., 2008], bottom waters in 203\t\r \u00a0\nthe North Pacific have also warmed recently [Fukasawa et al., 2003]. The rapid 204\t\r \u00a0\ntimescale of this warming (order of four decades) was likely accomplished by a fast 205\t\r \u00a0\nteleconnection facilitated by internal Rossby and Kelvin waves, which have the action 206\t\r \u00a0\nof slowing the deep currents that transport AABW northwards. If true also in the 207\t\r \u00a0\nAtlantic, with the perturbations that generated the wave teleconnection being changes 208\t\r \u00a0\nin the WSDW outflow of the type described here, the superposition of such fast wave-209\t\r \u00a0\nmediated signals upon slower advective changes would generate significant 210\t\r \u00a0\ncomplexity, and make attribution of measured deep ocean climate change even more 211\t\r \u00a0\nchallenging. This is compounded by the fact that the outflow processes outlined here 212\t\r \u00a0\nare not represented in current climate-scale ocean models. 213\t\r \u00a0\n 214\t\r \u00a0\nThe changes in WSDW observed here were caused by changes in winds that project 215\t\r \u00a0\nstrongly onto the pattern of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), consistent with 216\t\r \u00a0\nJullion et al. [2010]. The SAM has moved to a higher-index state in recent decades, 217\t\r \u00a0\nassociated with anthropogenic forcing from ozone depletion and\/or greenhouse gases, 218\t\r \u00a0\nresulting in stronger winds over the Southern Ocean [Marshall, 2003; Thompson and 219\t\r \u00a0\nSolomon, 2002]. To the extent that the mechanisms described here are relevant on 220\t\r \u00a0\ndecadal timescales, this carries the implication that anthropogenic processes may be 221\t\r \u00a0\nsignificant in the abyssal warming along the length of the Atlantic. If the winds over 222\t\r \u00a0\nthe Southern Ocean continue to strengthen in future years and decades (either via 223\t\r \u00a0\nthere being a stronger mean, or more frequent events such as that seen in 2001), this 224\t\r \u00a0\ncould result in warmer classes of WSDW being supplied more efficiently to the lower 225\t\r \u00a0\nlimb of the global overturning circulation. To detect and correctly attribute such 226\t\r \u00a0\nchanges, a system capable of monitoring both properties and fluxes is required. 227\t\r \u00a0\n\t\r \u00a0 11\t\r \u00a0\nAccordingly, we will deploy shortly a comprehensive mooring array in the narrowest 228\t\r \u00a0\npart of OP. Sustaining this for several decades will be difficult, but is required to meet 229\t\r \u00a0\nthe challenges outlined here. 230\t\r \u00a0\n 231\t\r \u00a0\n 232\t\r \u00a0\nAcknowledgements 233\t\r \u00a0\nWe thank Peter Foden, Steve Mack, Bob Spencer and Ian Vassie for their work with 234\t\r \u00a0\nMYRTLE.
