There are people\nwho consider themselves to be practitioners pure and simple; others who only research this\narea; a fair number who do both.\nBecause of this, there is a tension between timeliness and the need for deliberation in the\narticles that are printed. ALT-N already provides a forum for articles where timeliness is the\ngreatest priority; ALT-J, therefore, must concentrate on articles where the emphasis is on\nidentifying the wider context, providing considered debate or giving longer-term analyses.\nHowever, in a field as fast-moving as learning technology, there always remains the need to\nensure that current issues are addressed.\nFortunately, the submissions for this issue have provided a good mix of timely discussion\nand consideration of long-term concerns. We have, for example, Plewes and Issroff's review\npaper, which will be particularly relevant to the UK-based projects soon to be funded\nunder the JISC's Exchange for Learning call; Pearson and Koppi's analysis of inclusion\nand accessibility online, which is particularly timely for UK universities facing changes to\nthe Disability Discrimination Act; and Waycott's article on the use of the increasingly\npopular Personal Digital Assistants.\nAt the same time, we have articles which address longstanding areas of concern, such as\nSingh and Dron's study of cross-cultural interaction, or Holt et al.'s questioning of\nassumptions about the benefits of online learning. Alsop and Tompsett offer a piece that is\nas much about methodology as about findings. It is to be hoped that their concern for\nmethodology will prompt other researchers in this area to adopt a similarly thoughtful and\nhonest approach.\nThis leads well into mention of an aspiration for future issues. ALT-TS diversity is\nimportant to maintain, but as noted earlier, not at the expense of scholarship. Indeed, this\nis an area that we are actively seeking to develop. To achieve this, we have begun to tighten\n2\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 2\nup the submission and review process. In future, our handling of submissions should be\nsmoother and swifter; at the same time, reviews of papers will become more focused. All\nauthors will be expected to locate their paper within a wider research context, and a more\nconsistent format will be adopted for articles, giving more importance to discussion of\nmethodology and the paper's structure.\nFinally, readers will notice that our 'experiment' from the last issue is featured again here.\nThe feedback we have received has been universally positive, so we are planning to\ncontinue these discussions as a regular part of the journal. This issue sees Gwyneth\nHughes replying to Gunn, French, MacLeod, McSporran and Conole's article on gender\nissues. We hope, that this is merely the start of the debate - on this topic, and on the others\nthat we plan to feature.\nMartin Oliver\nDeputy Editor\n3\n"}
