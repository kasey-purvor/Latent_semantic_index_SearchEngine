Measured \nvalues of [Cu2+], which were in the range 10-11 to 10-5 mol L-1, were compared with those 5 \nsimulated using Humic Ion-Binding Models V and VI.  It was assumed that copper speciation \nwas controlled by the organic matter, represented by fulvic acid (FA), together with inorganic \nsolution complexation (calculated with an inorganic speciation model).  The models were \ncalibrated by adjusting a single quantity, the concentration of FA.  The optimised value - \n[FA]opt - was that giving the best agreement, according to least squares, between measured 10 \nand simulated [Cu2+].  The calculations took into account competition by other dissolved \n(filterable) metals (Mg, Al, Ca, Fe(II), Fe(III), Zn); in the case of Fe(III) it was assumed either \nthat all the dissolved metal was truly in solution, or that the activity of Fe3+ was controlled by \nequilibrium with Fe(OH)3.  The assumption about Fe(III) had relatively small effects on the \nfitting of Model V, but was significant for Model VI, because Model VI represents low-15 \nabundance, high-affinity binding sites in humic matter, which are sensitive to Fe(III) \ncompetition.  Because of its inclusion of the high-affinity sites, Model VI provided better fits \nof the data than did Model V.  Furthermore, Model VI with Fe3+ activity controlled by \nFe(OH)3 gave smaller variation in the ratio of [FA]opt to [DOC] than Model VI with all Fe(III) \nassumed to be in solution.  The average [FA]opt\/[DOC] found from the Cu titrations was 1.30, 20 \nwhich implies that 65% of the organic matter is \u201cactive\u201d with respect to metal binding.  The \naverage ratio of 1.30 is in reasonable agreement with ratios obtained by applying the model to \nfield data sets for charge balance (1.22), Al speciation (1.56) and base titrations of Cu-\namended waters (1.45).  It is concluded that Model VI \/ Fe(OH)3 provides the most reliable \npredictions of dissolved metal speciation in natural waters; at a total Cu concentration of 1 25 \n\u00b5M, the predicted concentration of Cu2+ is expected to be correct to within a factor of 3.6 in \n95% of cases. \n \n \nKeywords:   dissolved organic carbon; copper; speciation; model; freshwater30 \n17\/03\/08 Copper binding by organic matter REVISION  \/ Bryan et al. 3\n1. Introduction \n \nThe Biotic Ligand Model (BLM; Paquin et al., 2000) combines a chemical \nequilibrium model that describes metal speciation (including the biotic ligand) with a toxicity \nmodel that relates accumulation of metal at the biotic ligand to toxic effect.  The toxicological 5 \nparts of the model have been developed and tested using the results of laboratory experiments \n(e.g. Playle et al., 1993; MacRae et al., 1999; Meyer et al., 1999).  Its application to field \nsituations will rely on the chemical equilibrium sub-model to account for the interactions of \npotentially toxic metals with other solutes, and perhaps eventually particulate matter.  It is \nclearly desirable to determine how well the chemical equilibrium sub-model can describe the 10 \nmetal chemistry of natural waters.  The purpose of the work described here was to test the \nabilities of the current solution speciation model used in the BLM (Humic Ion-Binding Model \nV; Tipping and Hurley, 1992), and of a recent improved version (Model VI; Tipping, 1998), \nto simulate copper speciation in freshwater samples.  \nThe present study builds upon previous work in which humic ion-binding models have 15 \nbeen tested with data on charge balance and aluminium speciation (Tipping et al., 1991) and \non copper speciation in Cu-amended natural waters titrated with base (Dwane and Tipping, \n1998).  It was found that in order to account for observed speciation in field samples, a \ncalibration procedure has to be performed, involving the \u201cbinding activity\u201d of natural organic \nmatter.  For waters, satisfactory results have been achieved by assuming the cation-binding 20 \nagent to have the properties of isolated fulvic acid (FA).  Comparison of the concentrations of \nFA that give the best agreement between observation and model prediction showed that \nbetween 40 and 80% of the dissolved organic carbon has to be due to FA, the rest being \nassumed inert with respect to ion binding.  \nThese previous model-testing studies have involved proton and metal binding at the 25 \nmost abundant, lowest affinity, binding sites of natural organic matter.  Potentially toxic \nmetals such as Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb will generally be present at relatively low \nconcentrations, even in polluted waters, and so less abundant, higher affinity, sites will be \nimportant.  The existence and influence of the high affinity sites in humic substances have \ncome to prominence in the research agenda, following the experimental and modelling work 30 \nof Benedetti et al. (1995) and Kinniburgh et al. (1996, 1999), which demonstrated the high \ndegree of heterogeneity in binding site strengths in isolated humic acids.  To describe metal \nbinding by isolated humic matter at low site occupancies, Model V was modified, its \n17\/03\/08 Copper binding by organic matter REVISION  \/ Bryan et al. 4\nsuccessor (Model VI; Tipping, 1998) providing a better description of the heterogeneity of \nhumic binding sites.   \nIn the present work we tested the abilities of Models V and VI to account for the \nspeciation of Cu added to natural water samples containing varying amounts of dissolved \nnatural organic matter.  We sampled and analysed a total of fifteen samples, and performed 5 \nCu titrations under standardised conditions, determining [Cu2+] using an ion-selective \nelectrode.  The observed values of [Cu2+] were compared with simulated values, generated by \nModels V and VI. \nIn the following text, square brackets - [  ] \u2013 indicate concentrations, aX the solution \nactivity of species X, DOC dissolved organic carbon, FA fulvic acid, HA humic acid and I 10 \nionic strength. \n \n \n2.  Humic Ion-Binding Models V and VI \n 15 \nDetailed descriptions have been given of Model V (Tipping and Hurley, 1992) and \nModel VI (Tipping, 1998).  The models use a structured formulation of discrete, chemically \nplausible, binding sites for protons, to allow the creation of regular arrays of bidentate (and \ntridentate in Model VI) binding sites for metals.  Electrostatic interactions, dependent upon \nnet humic charge, ionic strength and the charge of the combining cation, are dealt with using a 20 \none-parameter (P) empirical expression.  A Donnan sub-model is used to account for \ncounterion accumulation; each counterion can be assigned a selectivity coefficient (Ksel).  \nFulvic and humic acids are assumed to be rigid spheres of uniform size, with ion-binding \ngroups positioned randomly on the molecular surfaces.  Proton dissociation is represented by \npostulating eight groups with different acid strengths.  The dissociation reaction can be written 25 \ngenerally as \nHHum)((HumH) 1Z +-Z  +=     (1) \nwhere Hum represents the humic molecule, and Z is the net charge.  The reactions are \ncharacterised by intrinsic equilibrium constants, the negative logarithms of which are denoted \nby pK1 - pK8.  The four most strongly-acid groups (groups 1 - 4) are referred to as type A 30 \ngroups, and consist mainly of carboxylic acid groups, while the remaining four groups (type B) \nrepresent weaker acids, such as phenolic acids.  The eight pKi values are expressed in terms of \nfour constants (pKA, pKB, \u2206pKA and \u2206pKB) as follows \n17\/03\/08 Copper binding by organic matter REVISION  \/ Bryan et al. 5\nAA p6\n)52(pp41for KiKKi i \u2206\n\u2212\n+=\u2212=    (2) \nBB p6\n)132(pp85for KiKKi i \u2206\n\u2212\n+=\u2212=    (3)  \nThus the values of pKA and pKB are the average pK values of the two types of group, while \n\u2206pKA and \u2206pKB are measures of the spread of the individual pKi values around the means.  \nPositive values of  \u2206pKA and \u2206pKB mean that the pKi values increase as i increases, i.e. the 5 \ngroups become progressively weaker acids.  Each type A group is assigned an abundance of \nnA\/4 mol g-1 humic matter, and each type B group an abundance of nA\/8 mol g-1.  Thus, within a  \ntype, each group is present in equal amounts, and there are half as many type B groups as type \nA groups.  The imposed regularity of the groups facilitates the formulation of multidentate \nbinding sites for metals.  10 \n Metal ions (apart from Na+, K+ and other monovalent cations that bind very weakly), \nand their first hydrolysis products, compete with each other, and with protons, for the type A \nand type B groups.  Monodentate binding at type A sites is formulated as metal-proton \nexchanges, characterised by the constant KMHA, and an analogous constant (KMHB) applies to the \ntype B sites.  The strength of binding of metal ions to the four type A sites parallels the strength 15 \nof proton-binding to those sites.  Again, the expressions are analogous for the type B sites.  \nWhen fitting data with the model, the values of KMHA and KMHB are the optimised quantities for \neach metal ion. \n Bidentate sites are generated by combining pairs of proton-binding sites, and can be A-\nA or A-B sites.  The equilibrium constants are the products of the values for the individual sites.  20 \nThe pairing of proton-binding sites to form bidentate sites is arranged so that all sites are \nequally represented, and all bidentate sites are present in equal abundance, but only 12 of the \npossible 36 combinations are used to avoid unnecessary computation.  Only proton-dissociating \nsites that are sufficiently close together are able to form bidentate sites.  Proximities are \nestimated statistically by assuming the sites to be on the surface of the sphere (Tipping and 25 \nHurley, 1992).  Pairs of groups form bidentate sites if they are less than or equal to 0.45 nm \napart.  Sites that are close enough to pair up take part only in bidentate reactions with metal \ncations, i.e. they cannot form monodentate complexes.  The fraction of proton-dissociating sites \nable to form pairs is denoted by fpr. \n The maximum number of parameter values that can be optimised is six for proton 30 \ndissociation (nA, pKA, pKB, \u2206pKA, \u2206pKB, P) and three (KMHA, KMHB, Ksel) for each metal cation.  \nThree parameters (radius, molecular weight and proximity factor) are fixed from the start, from \n17\/03\/08 Copper binding by organic matter REVISION  \/ Bryan et al. 6\nliterature information and a priori assumptions.  In practice it has been found that reasonable \nresults can be obtained by establishing a relationship between the two parameters for metal-\nbinding, KMHA and KMHB, and for dilute systems such as freshwaters all values of Ksel can \nusually be set to unity. \n Model VI was developed from Model V firstly to obtain a wider range of binding 5 \naffinities for metal ions, and secondly to relax the parallel relationship between metal and \nproton-binding.  With regard to proton-dissociating groups, the assumed molecular dimensions, \nand the electrostatic sub-model, Models V and VI are identical.  They differ only in the way in \nwhich metal-binding reactions are formulated.  Instead of using metal-proton exchanges, \nequilibrium constants for the binding of metal ions at deprotonated sites are employed.  10 \nMonodentate binding takes place according to the general reaction \nzZzZ +\n=+ HumM)(MHum     (4)  \nThe equilibrium constants are given by \n1AMA 6\n)52(log)(log:41sitesfor LKiKiK \u2206\u2212+=\u2212    (5) \n1BMB 6\n)132(log)(log:85sitesfor LKiKiK \u2206\u2212+=\u2212    (6) 15 \nwhere \u2206LKA1 and  \u2206LKB1 are constants.  Thus the values of log KMA,i are evenly spaced around \nthe mean of log KMA but the spacing is not necessarily the same as that for protons, which is the \ncase in Model V, i.e. in general \u2206LK1 is not equal to -\u2206pKA.  The same applies to the type B \nsites.  \n In Model VI, metal cations and their first hydrolysis products may bind at both bidentate 20 \nand tridentate sites.  For a bidentate site comprising single sites j and k, the association constant \nK(j,k) is given by \n2)(log)(log),(log LKxkKjKkjK \u2206++=    (7) \n where \u2206LK2 is an adjustable parameter.  The value of x is zero for 90.1 % of the sites, 1 for 9 \n%, and 2 for 0.9 %.  This generates heterogeneity, with a small number of strong sites, a larger 25 \nnumber of moderately strong ones, and a majority of weak ones.  Analogous rules are used for \nthe tridentate sites, made up of single sites l, m and n \n 2)(log)(log)(log),,(log LKynKmKlKnmlK \u2206+++=   (8) \nHere, y is 0, 1.5 or 3 for the 90.1 %, 9 % and 0.9 % abundances.  Each metal ion has a \ncharacteristic \u2206LK2.   30 \n17\/03\/08 Copper binding by organic matter REVISION  \/ Bryan et al. 7\n The fractions of single sites that contribute to the bidentate or tridentate sites are \ndetermined statistically, as in Model V, by assuming the proton sites to be randomly positioned \non the surfaces of the (spherical) molecules.  The fraction of sites forming bidentate sites is \ndenoted by fprB, that for tridentates is fprT.  For fulvic acid,  fprB = 0.42, fprT  = 0.03, while for \nhumic acid, the corresponding values are 0.50 and 0.065.  In Model VI, if all combinations of 5 \nproton sites are allowed, 36 different bidentate sites and 120 different tridentate sites can form, \nfor each of which there are three binding strengths, if \u2206LK2 is non-zero.  Together with the eight \nmonodenate sites, there could be 476 different sites in all.   The site abundances depend on their \ncomposition, in terms of type A and type B sites, the latter being present at half the total \nabundance of the former.  For example, tridentate sites comprising three type A proton sites are 10 \neight times more abundant than those comprising three type B sites.  To avoid over-\ncomplication, and to speed computations, a sub-set of sites is used in the model, while \nmaintaining the relative proportions of the contributing proton sites.  Bidentate or tridentate \nsites are allowed to consist only of different proton sites, and only 24 representative \ncombinations are adopted.  The 24 allowed combinations lead to 72 different sites, because of 15 \nthe heterogeneity terms (equations 7 and 8).   With the addition of the eight monodentate sites, \nthere are 80 different sites in all.  \n In Model VI, the maximum number of parameters that can be optimised to describe \nproton dissociation is six, exactly as in Model V.   For each metal cation (plus its first \nhydrolysis product), up to six could be optimised (KMA, KMB, \u2206LKA1, \u2206LKB1, \u2206LK2, Ksel), 20 \nalthough the number can be reduced substantially by taking into account data for many metals.  \n Values of model parameters used in this study are given in Tables 1 and 2.  For \napplication to natural water samples, the humic binding models were combined with an \ninorganic speciation model, the database for which was presented by Tipping (1994).  The \ncombination of Model V with the inorganic speciation model is the core of the Windermere 25 \nHumic Aqueous Model (WHAM; Tipping, 1994). \n \n \n3.  Methods \n 30 \n3.1.  Sample collection and analysis for major solutes \n \nAt each site, a 15 L sample of water was collected in 5 L acid washed polyethylene \ncontainers taking care not to disturb any sediment.  Powder-less gloves were worn throughout \n17\/03\/08 Copper binding by organic matter REVISION  \/ Bryan et al. 8\nthe sampling procedure, and containers were rinsed with some sample water prior to \ncollection.  Samples were transported to the lab as soon as possible after collection, and were \nfiltered (Whatman, GF\/F) before storage in the dark at 4\u00baC.  A sub sample was acidified after \nfiltering for trace metal analysis.  The pH of the sample was determined using a Radiometer \ncombination electrode (GK2401C) at the temperature of the natural water.  The sample was 5 \ncollected in a glass stoppered bottle taking care not to entrain any air.  The electrode was \ncalibrated using BDH buffers at pH 7 and 4.  The quality of the electrode was tested using a \n10-4 M HCl solution prepared by accurate dilution of a 0.1 M certified standard (Fisons) \n(Davison, 1990).  Dissolved organic carbon was determined on the filtered sample using a \nDohrmann DC190 high temperature TOC analyser.  A Perkin-Elmer 2380 atomic absorption 10 \nspectrophotometer was used to analyse the filtered samples for major cations (Na+, Mg2+, K+, \nCa2+).  A Dionex 2000i\/SP was used to analyse for major anions (Cl-, NO3-, SO42-) by high \nperformance ion chromatography (HPIC).  A PQe\/Eclipse inductively coupled mass \nspectrometer (ICP-MS) was used to determine trace metal concentrations (Al, Mn, Cu, Zn, \nCd, Pb), on samples acidified (1% HNO3) immediately after filtration.  Alkalinity was 15 \ndetermined by Gran titration.  Ferrous iron in filtered samples was determined \nspectrophotometrically using bathophenanthroline without the addition of a reductant, total \niron was measured following overnight reduction with hydroxylammonium chloride, and \nferric iron was obtained by difference. \n 20 \n3.2.  Copper titrations \n \nThe same titration protocol was applied to each natural water sample, thereby allowing \ndirect comparisons to be made amongst samples.  To ensure that significant binding by \ndissolved organic matter would take place, titrations were performed at pH 6 and pH 7.  The 25 \neffect of ionic strength was examined by carrying out the pH 6 titrations on one sample with \nno added salt and on another with the ionic strength increased to ~ 0.1 M. \nAmounts of acid or base required to achieve the desired pH values were determined as \nfollows.  One hundred cm3 of the filtered water sample was placed in a 200 cm3 tall form \nbeaker, held within a thermostatic jacket at 20\u00baC.  The solution was stirred at a constant rate 30 \nusing a magnetic stirrer, while being bubbled with water-saturated air, enriched to 10-3 atm \nwith CO2 to improve pH buffering.  The pH was monitored with a Radiometer combination \nelectrode (GK2401C) calibrated using pH 7 and 4 buffers (BDH).  Solution pH values were \nadjusted by adding  measured volumes of 0.01 M HNO3 or NaOH.  The pH was considered \n17\/03\/08 Copper binding by organic matter REVISION  \/ Bryan et al. 9\nstable once it had remained the same (\u00b1 0.02 pH) for one hour; this could take up to 8 hours \nfor high-alkalinity samples.  Starting solutions for copper titrations were prepared by adding \nthe volume of acid or base needed to adjust the pH to the required value (pH 6 or 7) to a 1 \nlitre volumetric flask, together with 25 cm3 of 4 M NaNO3 (AnalaR, BDH) if a high ionic \nstrength solution was required.  The flask was made to volume accurately, using the filtered 5 \nnatural water sample, with vigorous shaking.  Approximately 800 grams of the solution was \nthen weighed accurately to two decimal places into a 1 litre tall form beaker.  The beaker was \nplaced in a thermostatic jacket at 20\u00baC and was covered with a loose fitting lid.  The solution \nwas stirred at a constant rate using a magnetic stirrer and was bubbled with water-saturated \nair, enriched with CO2 (pCO2 = 0.001 atm) in order to improve pH buffering. 10 \n The Cu ion selective electrode (ISE) was prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s \ninstructions, and was calibrated in terms of activities using Cu(NO3)2 solutions in the range \n10-6-10-3 M.  The ionic strength of the calibration standard solutions was adjusted to 0.005 M \nfor the low ionic strength titrations and 0.1 M for titrations at I = 0.1 M.  The calibration \npotentials were taken once the mV reading had remained constant \u00b1 0.1 mV for 3 minutes. A 15 \nNernstian response was invariably achieved.  The calibrated Cu ISE and a pH combination \nelectrode were introduced to the titration solution through holes in the loose fitting lid, and the \nsystem was covered with a black bag to prevent light interfering with the Cu ISE.  The \nelectrodes were allowed to soak in the solution for 20 minutes and the pH was checked.  Any \nfine adjustments to the pH were made using dilute acid (0.1 M HNO3) or base (0.1 M NaOH) 20 \nnoting the volumes added.  Additions of titrant (Cu(NO3)2) were made with a carefully \ncalibrated automatic pipette, and total [Cu] in the system was calculated by combining the \nadded Cu with the Cu of the original water sample (\u2264 0.06 \u00b5M).  At low total [Cu], the \npotential given by the ISE fell slightly in response to additions of Cu, then passed through a \nthreshold concentration, above which the expected positive response was observed.  Only data 25 \npoints for total [Cu] clearly above the threshold were accepted.  Depending mainly on [DOC], \nthe threshold concentration was in the range 0.1 \u2013 1 \u00b5M.  Measured potentials were accepted \nwhen the drift was < 0.1 mV in 3 minutes.  This took up to 1 hour for the initial input, and \napproximately 20 minutes for readings thereafter.  The pH electrode potential was recorded at \nthe same time as the Cu ISE potential.  The pH changed relatively little (< 0.2 units) during a 30 \ntitration; model calculations were performed using the measured pH value as input.  The total \nCu concentration at the end of the titration was 10 - 20 \u00b5M.  Once the final potential had been \nrecorded the electrodes were removed from the solution, rinsed and their calibrations checked.  \n17\/03\/08 Copper binding by organic matter REVISION  \/ Bryan et al. 10\nEach titration was carried out in duplicate, so that six titrations were carried out for each \nsample.  The average number of data points per sample was 39 (range 18-53). \n \n \n4.  Results 5 \n \n4.1  Water compositions \n \nSurface water samples were collected from 15 sites (lakes, ponds, streams and rivers) \nin northern England and the south west of Scotland (Table 3).  Water chemistries ranged from 10 \nsoftwater and acid to hardwater and alkaline.  They were predominantly unpolluted, but some \n(Rivers Aire and Calder, River Tees at Neasham and Stockton) received industrial and sewage \neffluents, while others (Rivers Ouse and Derwent) were influenced by agricultural runoff and \npoint-source sewage inputs. The Rivers Ouse and Derwent are less polluted, and receive \npredominantly agricultural runoff and point source sewage effluent.  There is little variation in 15 \nthe [DOC] for all of these rivers.  The differences in pollution may result in differences in \nphysical and chemical properties of DOC (Tipping et al., 1997). Further details about the \nrivers and their organic matter contents are given by Jarvie et al. (1997) and Tipping et al. \n(1997). \n 20 \n4.2  Cu titration results \n \nThe Cu ISE permitted values of [Cu2+] as low as 10-11 M to be detected in experiments \non samples with high [DOC] at pH 7.  In contrast, the lowest concentration for samples with \nrelatively low [DOC] - and therefore poorer buffering of [Cu2+] - at pH 6, I = 0.1 M was 25 \ntypically 10-7 M.  In all cases, substantial amounts of Cu were complexed, the more so at low \ntotal copper concentrations. For example, the data points in Fig.1 for [Cu]total < 10-6 show c. \n98% complexation at pH 6, I = 0.1 M, 99% at pH 6, natural I, and 99.8% at pH 7, natural I.  \nLittle binding by inorganic ligands (OH-, HCO3-, CO32-) is expected, which means that \norganic matter is the main complexing agent.  The lowest amounts of Cu bound in our 30 \nexperiments corresponded to loadings of c. 5\u00d710-6 mol (g organic matter)-1, the highest to c. \n5\u00d710-4 mol (g organic matter)-1.  This is a comparatively wide range, greater than reported for \nmany experiments with isolated humic substances, and not much less than that obtained for \ncomparable pH values by Benedetti et al. (1995) in their work with high concentrations of \n17\/03\/08 Copper binding by organic matter REVISION  \/ Bryan et al. 11\nHA, which demonstrated the high degree of heterogeneity in binding-site strength for Cu.  \nThe sequence of binding always followed the pattern of Fig. 1, increasing in the order \n{pH 6, I = 0.1 M} < {pH 6, natural I} < {pH 7, natural I} \nThe increase in binding with pH is due to decreasing competition by H+, while the lower \nbinding at high ionic strength reflects the smaller electrostatic attraction between the metal 5 \ncation and the negatively-charged humic molecules. \n  \n4.3  Model applications \nIn optimising the models, it was assumed that the only proton and metal-binding \nagents in the filtered natural water samples were humic substances, represented by FA, and 10 \ninorganic solutes.  The default model parameters of Tables 1 and 2 were fixed.  Inputs to the \nmodel, at each titration point, were total concentrations of Cu, major solutes (Table 3), \nadjusted for dilution and any additions, pH, pCO2, and total concentrations of Fe(II) and Zn \n(not shown in Table 3).  Thus, the model calculated Cu speciation, taking into account \ncompetition among metals and protons for binding sites on FA, and among inorganic ligands.  15 \nConcentrations of FA - [FA]opt - were found that gave the best least-squares agreement \nbetween observed and simulated concentrations of Cu2+ in the titrations.  More elaborate \nschemes could have been tried, for example by including both FA and HA in the analysis, or \nby adjusting one or more of the model parameters.  However, we consider that the simple \napproach, based on the commonest form of humic matter in natural waters (i.e. FA), is the 20 \nmost appropriate, given the current state of knowledge.  Thus, to calibrate the model for a \ngiven sample, only a single quantity - [FA]opt - was adjusted.  The inputs to the calculations \ncomprised the measured solute concentrations at each titration step.  In the case of Fe(III) the \nphysicochemical form of the metal was uncertain, since it could have been present in true \nsolution (i.e. as monomeric metal) and\/or as colloidal iron hydroxide.  Therefore two 25 \nassumptions were made, first that all the Fe(III) was present as a monomeric solute, and \nsecond that the activity of Fe3+ was controlled by equilibrium with Fe(OH)3.  The solubility \nproduct of Fe(OH)3 (aFe3+\/aH+3) was taken to be 102.5 at 25oC (Baes and Mesmer, 1976).  For \neach titration, both models were applied, with both assumptions about Fe(III), making four \noptimisations in all.  To interpret the results, ratios of [FA]opt to [DOC] were computed.  The 30 \nratio would be close to 2.0 if all DOC were due to FA, assuming the FA to be 50% carbon. \nTable 4 summarises the results obtained.  In terms of root-mean-squared-deviations, \nModel VI performed better than Model V in 12 of the 15 samples.  Another noteworthy \nfeature of the results is that the variability of [FA]opt \/ [DOC] is smallest for Model VI with \n17\/03\/08 Copper binding by organic matter REVISION  \/ Bryan et al. 12\nprecipitated Fe(OH)3, as is evident from comparison of the standard deviations in Table 4.  \nFig. 1 provides an illustration of the trends in goodness-of-fit.  The main effect of assuming \nsolubility control by Fe(OH)3 is the diminution of the amount of Fe(III) taking part in the \nbinding reactions; this is why the [FA]opt \/ [DOC] ratios are lower when Fe(OH)3 is assumed \nto be present.  In fact, the results are rather insensitive to the choice of solubility product for 5 \nFe(OH)3, as long as it is lower than 104.0.  We conclude that the best description of the Cu \ntitration data obtained in the present work comes from Model VI with precipitated Fe(OH)3.  \nFig. 2 shows four examples of the application of this version of Model VI.   \nComparisons can be made with results obtained by applying the models to other data \nsets.  As shown in Table 5, the average [FA]opt \/ [DOC] ratios obtained with Model VI are less 10 \nvaried than those with Model V.  This can be explained by the greater range of binding-site \nheterogeneity provided by Model VI.  The two models perform similarly for relatively high \ndegrees of site saturation, but Model V needs a greater [FA]opt to account for the present data \nset, because low site occupancies of Cu have been achieved.  Model VI accounts for the four \ndatasets using quite similar [FA]opt \/ [DOC] ratios.  15 \n \n4.4  Complexation of Cu by carbonate species   \n The calculations performed in the present work employed the inorganic data base \nsupplied with the standard WHAM software (Tipping, 1994).  This data base includes a value \nfor the formation constant of CuHCO3+ which may be too high.  The log K value used, based 20 \non an estimate by Mattigod and Sposito (1979), is 14.62 (for the reaction Cu2+ + H+ + CO32- = \nCuHCO3+), whereas the equivalent recommended value in the NIST data base (Smith et al., \n1995) is only 12.13.  Therefore the present calculations may have overestimated the \nimportance of CuHCO3+.  Table 6 illustrates the effect on the calculated value of [Cu2+], \nwhich is the key species in the application of the BLM.  The results calculated with the two 25 \nequilibrium constants differ most for pH 7 with zero or low concentrations of DOC; at higher \n[DOC], complexation by the organic matter controls [Cu2+].  In the absence of DOC, there are \nonly small differences in [Cu2+] at pH 5.5, where there is little complexation of the metal by \ncarbonate species, and also at pH 8.5, where complexation by carbonate species is \nconsiderable, but where the complex CuCO3, rather than CuHCO3+, is dominant. 30 \n Uncertainty about the formation constant of CuHCO3+ will have had little effect on the \nestimation of Model V or Model VI binding parameters, because the great majority of \nexperimental data sets with isolated humic matter were obtained under conditions where Cu \ncomplexation by carbonate species was negligible.  Therefore, it is safe to continue to use the \n17\/03\/08 Copper binding by organic matter REVISION  \/ Bryan et al. 13\nmodel parameters obtained by averaging values derived from individual data sets (e.g. \nTipping and Hurley, 1992; Tipping, 1994, 1998).  With regard to the calibration of the model \nas described in the present work, the use of the lower formation constant for CuHCO3+ leads \nto small changes in values of [FA]opt.  Thus, calibration of Model VI, assuming precipitation \nof Fe(OH)3 and the lower value of the formation constant, yields an overall conversion factor 5 \nof 1.36, only slightly greater than the value of 1.30 obtained with the higher formation \nconstant (cf. Table 4). \n \n \n5.  Discussion 10 \n Models V and VI have been parameterised almost entirely with laboratory data from \nstudies of the binding of single metals by isolated humic substances.  Their application to the \nchemistry of an individual metal in field samples relies not only on the parameter values for \nthat metal, but also on the values for competing metals, and of course protons.  Given this \ninterdependence of parameters, i.e. the need for a coherent parameter set, it is difficult to 15 \njustify the adjustment of individual values in order to fit field data, unless detailed \nmeasurements are made of the binding of all the relevant metals at a range of pH values.  \nEven if this could be done, the issue of the \u201cbinding activity\u201d of natural organic matter would \nstill need to be resolved.  In the present work, we attributed all differences between measured \nand simulated values of [Cu2+] to variations in \u201cbinding activity\u201d among the water samples.  20 \nThis led to ranges of [FA]opt\/[DOC] ratios, the smallest range (0.80 \u2013 1.82) being found for \nModel VI with Fe(OH)3 precipitation.  Since that model format also provided the lowest \naverage error between observed and simulated [Cu2+] (Table 4), it is the preferred means to \nestimate Cu speciation in field samples.  The average [FA]opt\/[DOC] ratio of 1.30 (or 1.36 if \nthe lower stability constant for CuHCO3+ is used; Section 4.4) implies that 65% (68%) of the 25 \nDOC is due to organic matter that possesses the cation binding properties of average isolated \nFA, while the remainder of the DOC is inert with respect to ion binding.  This value agrees \nwell with estimates from other field measurements (Table 5).  It could arise because of a \ngenuine split between active and inactive DOC, or could reflect a continuum of molecules \nwith varying binding properties.  Another possibility is that, during isolation, additional 30 \nbinding sites are generated in humic matter, leading to greater ion-binding activity in \nlaboratory studies.  Finally, the optimisation of [FA] may be compensating for inaccuracies in \nthe fixed binding parameters.  The finding that only part of the organic matter is required to \nexplain the experimental measurements makes it unlikely that other significant binding agents \n17\/03\/08 Copper binding by organic matter REVISION  \/ Bryan et al. 14\n(e.g. mineral colloids or anthropogenic organic ligands) have been overlooked, for the \nsamples and ranges of total copper concentration studied.  It can be noted that, at lower total \ncopper concentrations, a significant part of the metal may be present in strong complexes with \nnon-humic ligands, for example sulphur-containing species (Rozan et al., 2000).    \n Routine calculations of copper speciation are best made using the mean [FA]opt\/[DOC] 5 \nratios given in Table 4.  To illustrate the application of this procedure, we calculated [Cu2+] \nfor all the titration points in the present study with [Cu]tot = 1 \u00b5M, and compared them with \nthe measured values.  The plots in Fig. 3 show that Model V predicts [Cu2+] to within 0.8 log \nunits (a factor of 6.3) in 95% of cases, while Model VI is somewhat more precise, predicting \nto within a factor of 3.6 in 95% of cases.  If it is accepted that the samples studied in the 10 \npresent work are representative of natural freshwaters, then these errors can be assigned to \nestimates of [Cu2+] made for any freshwater to which the models are applied.  \nIn conclusion, the results show the models to provide realistic predictions of copper \nspeciation in mildly-perturbed field samples.  With plausible assumptions about the nature of \nnatural organic matter, the models are able to account for the dependence of binding on total 15 \nmetal concentration, competition by protons and other metals, and the effects of ionic \nstrength.  With regard to solution-phase chemical speciation, we can therefore have \nconfidence in the field applicability of the Biotic Ligand Model. \n \n 20 \n6.  Regulatory implications \nStudies of the kind reported here are necessary to test the speciation modelling aspects of \nBLM applications.  Regulators can use the findings to judge whether such modelling is \nsufficiently convincing to be employed practically.  Furthermore, we have provided \nindications of uncertainty in the modelling outputs, which Regulators can use to decide upon 25 \nappropriate safety factors in setting acceptable copper concentrations. \n \n \n \n 30 \nAcknowledgements \n We are grateful to the staff of the CEH Windermere Chemical Analytical Laboratory \nfor help with water analysis, and to the Freshwater Biological Association for a grant to \nS.E.B.  \n17\/03\/08 Copper binding by organic matter REVISION  \/ Bryan et al. 15\nReferences \n \nBaes, C.F., Mesmer R.E., 1976.

The results \nrefer to pH 6, I = 0.1 M (closed circles), pH 6, natural ionic strength (open circles) and pH 7, \nnatural ionic strength (closed squares).  The dotted lines are model fits assuming all Fe(III) to \nbe in solution, the full lines are fits assuming the activity of Fe3+ to be controlled by Fe(OH)3.  \n \nFig. 2  Copper titration data fitted with Model VI with precipitation of Fe(OH)3.  The symbols \nhave the same meaning as those in Fig. 1. \n \nFig. 3  Comparisons of predicted and observed [Cu2+] at [Cu]tot = 1 \u00b5M.  The observed \nvalues are from all the titrations carried out on the 15 samples studied in the present work.  \nThe calculated values were obtained by applying Models V and VI, assuming equilibrium \nwith Fe(OH)3, and using the mean [FA]opt\/[DOC] ratios given in Table 4.  The dotted lines \ninclude 95% of the calculated values. \n17\/03\/08 Copper binding by organic matter \/ Bryan et al. 24\n[Cu]total  mol L-1\n10-7 10-6 10-5\n[C\nu\n2+\n]  m\no\nl L\n-\n1\n10-10\n10-9\n10-8\n10-7\n10-6\n10-5\n10-4\nModel VI\n10-7 10-6 10-5\n[C\nu\n2+\n]  m\no\nl L\n-\n1\n10-10\n10-9\n10-8\n10-7\n10-6\n10-5\n10-4\nModel V\n17\/03\/08 Copper binding by organic matter \/ Bryan et al. 25\n10-7 10-6 10-5\n[C\nu\n2+\n]  m\no\nl L\n-\n1\n10-11\n10-10\n10-9\n10-8\n10-7\n10-6\n10-5\nCoalburn #2\n10-7 10-6 10-5\n10-11\n10-10\n10-9\n10-8\n10-7\n10-6\n10-5\nRoudsea Wood stream\n[Cu]total  mol L-1\n10-7 10-6 10-5\n10-11\n10-10\n10-9\n10-8\n10-7\n10-6\n10-5\nPool Y at Great Dun Fell\n[Cu]total  mol L-1\n10-7 10-6 10-5\n[C\nu\n2+\n]  m\no\nl L\n-\n1\n10-11\n10-10\n10-9\n10-8\n10-7\n10-6\n10-5 Pool X at Great Dun Fell\n17\/03\/08 Copper binding by organic matter \/ Bryan et al. 26\n \nlog [Cu2+]obs  mol L-1\n-11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6\nlo\ng \n[C\nu\n2+\n] ca\nlc\n \n \nm\no\nl L\n-\n1\n-11\n-10\n-9\n-8\n-7\n-6 Model VI\nlog [Cu2+]obs  mol L-1\n-11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6\nlo\ng \n[C\nu\n2+\n] ca\nlc\n \n \nm\no\nl L\n-\n1\n-11\n-10\n-9\n-8\n-7\n-6 Model V\n"}
