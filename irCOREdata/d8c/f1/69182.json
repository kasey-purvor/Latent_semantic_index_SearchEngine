Introduction\n[2] Although, at present, there is no precise, comprehen-\nsive phenomenological definition of what sawtooth events\nare, they can easily be identified in a qualitative sense. A\nworking definition that has been adopted is that they are\nlarge-amplitude quasi-periodic oscillations of the energetic\nparticle fluxes at geosynchronous orbit [e.g., Belian et al.,\n1995]. These oscillations typically occur during storm inter-\nvals, they have a periodicity of approximately 2\u20134 hours\n[e.g., see, Borovsky et al., 2003; Henderson, 2004] and\nare particularly prominent in the energetic proton fluxes\n(>50 keV). Sawtooth events occur during storms when the\nring current is enhanced and are driven by moderate to\nstrong (Bz ] \u000110 nT) and continuously southward IMF\nconditions. They are termed \u2018\u2018sawtooth events\u2019\u2019 because the\nshape of the proton flux versus time traces displays a series\nof slow decreases followed by rapid increases that resemble\nthe teeth of a saw blade.\n[3] The gradual flux decreases and sharp increases of\neach tooth are associated with strong stretching and dipola-\nrization (respectively) of the magnetic field at geosynchro-\nnous orbit. While this behavior is strongest on the nightside,\nit can extend well past the terminators into the dayside,\nparticularly on the duskside. In addition, each tooth is\nassociated with an abrupt recovery in Sym-H [e.g., Reeves\net al., 2004]; [Huang et al., 2004], distributed particle\ninjections, and premidnight sector activations of the auroral\ndistribution [e.g., Reeves et al., 2004]. Although the ob-\nserved phenomenology in many data sets greatly resembles\nthat of substorms, it has been noted that the auroral activity\nrapidly engages a wider than usual azimuthal range and that\nthe injections can also be dispersionless over a much wider\nthan usual range of local times.

[2003]).\n[4] To address this issue, Henderson [2004] recently reex-\namined the CDAW-9C interval which spanned the time\nperiod from 0000 to 1200 UT on 3 May 1986. This interval\noccurred during the PROMIS (Polar Region and Outer\nMagnetosphere) campaign when the tail region was particu-\nlarly well-covered by a number of different spacecraft\n(AMPTE\/IRM, AMPTE\/CCE, ISEE-1\/2, SCATHA, GOES-\n5\/6, and three LANL geosynchronous spacecraft) and the\nauroral distribution was being monitored by the DE-1 and\nViking spacecraft [Pulkkinen et al., 1991; Baker et al., 1993;\nMinenko et al., 2000; Hones et al., 1987]. Although only a\nsingle substorm was selected for analysis by the CDAW-9\ncommunity, Henderson [2004] found that the full extended\ninterval was actually a sawtooth event and that the 0111 UT\nsubstorm selected for study (at CDAW-9) was an individual\nembedded tooth. It was conclusively demonstrated therefore\nthat the individual teeth that comprise a sawtooth event have\nindeed been identified as substorms in the past.\n[5] The excellent radial coverage in the tail during the\nCDAW-9C interval also allowed Henderson [2004] to show\nthat strong tail-like stretching can extend well inside of\ngeosynchronous orbit and that substorm-associated tail\nreconnection may occur inside of \u000111 RE down tail. The\nauthor concludes that a major difference between sawtooth\nand nonsawtooth substorms is that during sawtooth events\nthe activity in the tail is brought much closer to Earth and is\nmaintained there for extended periods of time.\n[6] Other studies of sawtooth events have focused on\nsolar wind triggering or driving of the teeth [Huang et al.,\n2003b; Lee et al., 2004] and on the behavior of the tail field\n[Huang, 2002; Huang et al., 2003a; Lui et al., 2004].\nReeves et al. [2004], Huang [2002], Huang et al. [2003a],\nand Henderson [2004] all conclude that sawtooth events are\nsequences of quasi-periodic substorms, while Lee et al.\n[2004] concludes that they are not but are rather directly\ndriven by solar wind pressure enhancements.\n[7] In this paper we further examine the 18 April 2002\nsawtooth event which was one of the most prominent and\nlong-lived events of its type in the LANL geosynchronous\ndata set. In addition, it occurred at a time when data was being\nacquired by six LANL-instrumented spacecraft and two\nNOAA GOES spacecraft. Data from these eight geosynchro-\nnous spacecraft provide an opportunity to explore the global\ncharacteristics of a sawtooth event with unprecedented cov-\nerage at geosynchronous orbit. In addition, the development\nof the auroral distribution during this event was captured with\ngood spatial and temporal evolution with the IMAGE\/FUV\nimager. Our main goals here are to (1) examine in detail the\nnature of the flux increases and field dipolarizations around\nthe globe, (2) characterize in detail the global evolution and\nmorphology of the auroral distribution, and (3) examine\nevidence for triggering of the individual teeth.\n2. Observations\n[8] In Figure 1a we show the LANL\/SOPA geosynchro-\nnous energetic electron and proton measurements at six\nlocations around the Earth together with the field inclination\nangle at GOES-8 (purple) and GOES-10 (green). The flux\nprofiles, particularly in the proton data, display the charac-\nteristic sawtooth pattern with a quasi-periodicity in the 2\u2013\n4 hour range. The vertical dashed lines indicate the onset\nof each tooth as determined from a combination of the\nelectron and proton measurements. Note that for the teeth\nnear 0800 and 1120 UT, more than one dashed line is\nshown. In these cases, there were multiple sudden\nincreases observed at one or more of the spacecraft.\n[9] The magnetic field inclination angle at the GOES-\n8 and GOES-10 spacecraft are shown in the bottom panel in\neach of the electron and proton plots shown in Figure 1a\n(this data was also presented recently by Lee et al. [2004]).\nSpecifically, the quantity plotted is the angle between the\nmagnetic field vector and the Geocentric Solar Magneto-\nspheric (GSM) equatorial plane (i.e., the x \u2013 y axis). Thus\nan angle of 90\u0001 indicates that the field direction is perpen-\ndicular to the GSM equatorial plane (i.e., dipole-like), while\nlow angles indicate a more tail-like stretched configuration.\nDifferences in the behavior and magnitude of the variations\nbetween the two GOES spacecraft can be attributed to the\nfact that they are at different magnetic latitudes and at\ndifferent local times. From Figure 1a, we can immediately\nsee that large dipolarizations of the field at geosynchronous\norbit occurred in association with the onset of some of the\nteeth. The 0239, 0530, 0806 UT teeth show particularly\ndramatic dipolarizations at GOES-10. On the other hand, we\nnote that a relatively weaker response was observed for the\n1120 UT tooth and no clear dipolarization signature at all\nwas observed for any of the other teeth. Thus for this event,\nthe large prominent dipolarizations seen at the GOES\nspacecraft were limited to times when those spacecraft were\n(approximately) on the nightside. This is consistent with\nother sawtooth events we have examined and clearly\nillustrates that, while abrupt flux increases are observed\naround the globe, the geosynchronous magnetic field dipo-\nlarization response is not global but rather typically con-\nfined (approximately) to the nightside.\n[10] The behavior of the geosynhcronous magnetic field\nshown here is quite typical of sawtooth events in general.\nOther studies showing similar events have been published\nby Reeves et al. [2004], Huang et al. [2003b], Henderson\n[2004], and Lee and Lyons [2004].\n[11] Note that due to the 2\u20134 hour periodicity of sawtooth\nevents, the dramatic coherent oscillatory behavior is most\nprominently seen in full-day summary plots like those\nshown in Figure 1a. Also note that in these plots the\nindividual teeth appear to represent simultaneous disper-\nsionless flux increases at all locations around the globe. To\nillustrate that this is in fact not the case, we show, in Figure\n1b, the LANL\/SOPA energetic electron and proton particle\nfluxes for a 2 hour interval encompassing the 0530 UT\ntooth. The vertical dashed line is drawn at 0530 UT and\nthe magnetic local time of each spacecraft is indicated. The\nproton data show that the flux increases observed on the\ndayside were clearly dispersed and that the dispersion\nincreases as one moves west from the 1991-080 spacecraft\n(at dusk), through local magnetic noon to the LANL-01A\nspacecraft (at dawn). In addition, the only increase in the\nenergetic electron fluxes at 0530 UT was seen at 1991-080,\nwhich was the only satellite in the dusk-to-midnight sector\nA01S90 HENDERSON ET AL.: THE 18 APRIL 2002 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n2 of 15\nA01S90\nFigure 1. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) energetic electron and proton data from six\ngeosynchronous spacecraft stationed at various locations around the world together with field inclination\nangle at the GOES-8 and GOES-10 geosynchronous spacecraft. From red to blue, the energies shown are\n50\u201375 keV, 75\u2013105 keV, 105\u2013150 keV, 150\u2013225 keV, 225\u2013315 keV, 315\u2013500 keV (for electrons) and\n50\u201375 keV, 75\u2013113 keV, 113\u2013170 keV, 170\u2013250 keV, 250\u2013400 keV (for protons). The vertical yellow\nand blue lines mark the time at which each satellite passed through local magnetic noon and midnight,\nrespectively.\nA01S90 HENDERSON ET AL.: THE 18 APRIL 2002 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n3 of 15\nA01S90\nat that time. None of the other LANL spacecraft observed\nan abrupt dispersionless energetic electron increase at\n0530 UT. In fact 1990-095 (in postmidnight sector) shows\nexactly the opposite, an abrupt flux decrease. This is\nfollowed several minutes later by a large dispersionless flux\nincrease at around 0542 UT. In addition, all of the spacecraft\nshow the highly dispersed signatures of drift echoes in the\nelectron data. These observations are consistent with a fairly\nwide but still localized (i.e., not global) duskward skewed\nnightside injection region (i.e., dusk-to-midnight sector).\nThe delayed dispersionless electron flux increases at\n1990-095 in the postmidnight sector may have been due\nto an eastward propagation of the envelope of activity.\n[12] To further illustrate the dispersive nature of the flux\nincreases for the other teeth, we present energy versus time\nspectrograms for each of the LANL spacecraft in Figure 2.\nData from all three LANL instruments (MPA, SOPA, ESP)\nare shown together in a format in which the electron\nenergies increase up the page while the proton energies\nincrease down the page (i.e., the so-called \u2018\u2018McIllwain\nformat\u2019\u2019). The energies cover a huge range from a few eV\nup to several MeV. A feature of this format is that the very\nlowest-energy particles (\u0002\u2018\u2018zero\u2019\u2019 energy particles) are\nplotted adjacent to each other which is useful because\nzero-energy particles have the same drift trajectories regard-\nless of their species. It is important to note also that the\ncolor levels in Figure 2 do not represent flux values. Since\nthe dynamic range in fluxes is very large (several orders of\nmagnitude), color spectrograms of flux or even energy flux\nare not suitable for the merged LANL data sets. Thus\nFigure 2. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) energetic proton data from six geosynchronous\nspacecraft stationed at various locations around the world.\nA01S90 HENDERSON ET AL.: THE 18 APRIL 2002 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n4 of 15\nA01S90\ninstead of flux, color in Figure 2 represents the deviation of\nthe flux from an average (energy-dependent) background\nlevel. These \u2018\u2018flux perturbation maps\u2019\u2019 are very useful for\nidentifying dispersion patterns in the data.\n[13] As an interpretive aid, we present an annotated\nversion of Figure 2 in Figure 3. We have attempted to\noutline (in a qualitative manner) some of the most relevant\ndispersion features observed. A color-coding scheme has\nbeen used in order to group the dispersion features associ-\nated with each tooth. Comparing these dispersion patterns\nwith those expected from the Mauk and Meng [1983]\ninjection boundary model (see their Figure 8), we can see\nthat they are all either \u2018\u2018type-1,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018type-2,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018type-7\u2019\u2019\ndispersion patterns (see Mauk and Meng\u2019s [1983]\nFigures 10, 11, and 16 for other examples of these patterns).\nThe dominant presence of these types of dispersion patterns\nindicates that the injection boundary was pushed inside of\ngeosynchronous orbit on the nightside for all of these\nevents. We will discuss this in more detail later, but for\nnow we wish to establish that the patterns were organized as\none would expected from the Mauk and Meng [1983]\nmodel, both in a statistical manner and in an instantaneous\nmanner.\n[14] Statistically, we can see that for each tooth, each\nspacecraft observed type-2 dispersion patterns when they\nwere near the noon-to-dusk sector, type-1 dispersion pat-\nFigure 3. Annotated version of Figure 2. Various dispersion features have been (qualitatively)\nhighlighted and the times for which each spacecraft was located within the dusk-to-midnight sector are\nindicated with red bars. Dispersion features associated with each tooth are grouped according to color.\nDotted lines represent faint or hard to follow dispersion features. Note that type-1 dispersion patterns tend\nto be observed when a spacecraft is situated on the nightside.\nA01S90 HENDERSON ET AL.: THE 18 APRIL 2002 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n5 of 15\nA01S90\nterns when they were closer to the dusk-to-midnight sectors\nand type-7 dispersion patterns when they were substantially\neastward of the midnight region. In addition, if one focuses\non a single tooth, the instantaneous distribution of disper-\nsion patterns also agrees with this ordering. The observed\ndispersion patterns at geosynchronous orbit are therefore\nconsistent with what one would expect from the standard\nKp-dependent injection boundary model. They are not\nconsistent with globally dispersionless injections but rather\nwith ones that were more localized (but still likely quite\nwide in azimuthal extent) on the nightside.\n[15] In Figure 4 we show selected IMAGE\/FUV WIC\nimages illustrating the behavior of the northern auroral\ndistribution before, during, and after the onset of the\n0315, 0530, 0806, and 1130 UT teeth. Each image is shown\nin Apex Magnetic Coordinates with noon at the top and\nmidnight at the bottom, and we have reduced the airglow\nsignal in order to more clearly see the entire global\ndistribution (see Immel et al. [2000] for details on the\nairglow removal technique). The latitude circles are drawn\nevery 10\u0001 between 50\u0001 and 90\u0001. We have divided the figure\ninto four columns. The third column shows the auroral\ndistribution at (or some minutes after) the onset of each\ntooth while the other columns show times before (first and\nsecond columns) and after (fourth column) the onset. In all\ncases shown, the onset of the tooth is associated with a\nlocalized brightening of the auroral distribution in the dusk\nto midnight sector on the lower branch of a so-called\n\u2018\u2018double oval\u2019\u2019 configuration. A double oval configuration\nis one in which a broadly extended (in azimuth) region of\nauroral emissions resides poleward of the main auroral oval.\nSuch double oval configurations are known to develop out\nof the recovery phase of some substorms and are also\ncharacteristic of Steady Magnetospheric Convection\n(SMC) intervals.\n[16] From Figure 4 we can see that the auroral distribu-\ntion develops in a systematic way prior to each onset. In\neach case a relatively wide double oval configuration is\nobserved on the order of an hour prior to onset (first\ncolumn). This double oval progressively thins (second\ncolumn) until a localized onset occurs on the equatormost\nportion in the dusk to midnight sector (third column).\nFollowing this, the initial brightening expands very rapidly\npoleward and azimuthally (fourth column). This expansion\nphase activity eventually evolves into the double oval type\nmorphology (e.g., first column) and the cycle repeats itself\nfor the duration of the sawtooth event. We note that each of\nthese onsets looks very much like storm-time \u2018\u2018embedded\u2019\u2019\nsubstorm onsets and are also fully consistent with the\nAkasofu description of breakup occurring on the equator-\nwardmost arc. Embedded onsets were first discovered in the\n1990s using the Viking UVI database [Murphree et al.,\n1991; Murphree and Cogger, 1992; Murphree et al., 1993]\nand typically consist of a localized premidnight sector onset\non the equatorward branch of a preexisting double-oval\nconfiguration.\nFigure 4. Selected IMAGE\/FUV WIC images illustrating the behavior of the auroral distribution\naround the time of the onset of each tooth.\nA01S90 HENDERSON ET AL.: THE 18 APRIL 2002 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n6 of 15\nA01S90\n[17] Another way to view the development of the auroral\ndistribution is shown in Figure 5. Here we present a\nsequence of keograms (constructed from the raw IMAGE\/\nFUV WIC images) showing meridional slices of the auroral\nintensity at 17 different magnetic local times. These latitude\nversus time plots clearly illustrate the behavior described\nabove. Specifically, each onset occurs on the lower branch\nof a thinned down double oval configuration. The aurora\nexpands poleward and then develops into a new double oval\nconfiguration which then thins down again prior to the next\nFigure 5. Keograms generated from a series IMAGE\/FUV WIC images showing the latitudinal motion\nof the aurora. (a) An example showing how keograms are created. The auroral intensities along the a\ngiven meridian is extracted from each image and stacked next to one another to create a latitude-versus-\ntime plot. (b) Keograms for MLT meridians ranging from 1400 MLT through midnight to 0600 MLT.\nA01S90 HENDERSON ET AL.: THE 18 APRIL 2002 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n7 of 15\nA01S90\nonset. From an examination of the keograms at different\nmagnetic local times, it is also clear that the auroral\ndistribution does not expand poleward simultaneously at\nall local times. The 0530 UT event, for example, clearly\nshows a time delay for the initial localized disturbance to\npropagate to the terminators. As noted above, this behavior\nis essentially the same as is observed for substorms,\nalthough here the onsets are \u2018\u2018embedded\u2019\u2019 in a preexisting\ndouble oval configuration and the expansion phase is more\nrapid and extensive than typical isolated substorms. For the\nother teeth shown in Figure 5, the azimuthal expansion is\nmore simultaneous (but still with some delay) in the dusk to\nmidnight sector, but we note that the expansion into the\nmorning sector is still significantly delayed and there is\noften little or no signature beyond 0300\u20130400 MLT.\n[18] The data presented in Figures 4 and 5 clearly show\nthat the explosive auroral disturbances associated with each\ntooth are not simultaneously global phenomena, but rather\nthey begin in a fairly localized region in the dusk to\nmidnight sector and expand rapidly in the azimuthal and\npoleward directions. Nevertheless, one may note that dy-\nnamic auroral activity still occurs over a wider azimuthal\nexpanse throughout the sawtooth event. For example, a\nnumber of auroral streamer events are observed which begin\nat the poleward branch of the double oval configuration and\npropagate equatorward. In the keograms of Figure 5 these\ncan be seen as equatorward moving lines. In addition, for\nmost of the sawtooth event, the auroral oval in the midnight\nto postdawn sector is quite active and displays eastward\npropagating omega-band forms. As shown by Henderson et\nal. [2002], auroral streamers can evolve into torch-like\nstructures and omega bands during active times and,\nalthough omega bands are commonly associated with sub-\nstorm recovery phase, they can also occur during SMCs. In\ngeneral, omega bands tend to be associated with the\ndynamics of the double oval configuration whether such a\nconfiguration is produced as a remnant of a prior substorm\nonset (i.e., a recovery phase feature) or is a more long-lived\nconfiguration typical of SMC events. For the 18 April 2002\nsawtooth event, both the double oval configuration and\nintense eastward propagating omega-band forms are prom-\ninent features that exist in the auroral distribution through-\nout the event in addition to the quasi-periodic substorm-like\nonsets. This is typical of sawtooth events and illustrates that\nsawtooth events behave very much like SMCs that are\npunctuated in a quasi-periodic manner by (embedded)\nsubstorms.\n[19] An interesting and important aspect of sawtooth\nevents is that they tend to be driven by solar wind\/IMF\nconditions that are very similar to those that drive SMCs.\nSpecifically, both types of events tend to develop when the\nIMF is continuously southward and reasonably steady for\nprolonged periods of time. Thus an interesting question that\narises is, For steady southward IMF driving conditions,\nwhat controls whether the magnetospheric response is an\nSMC or a sawtooth event? One clue to this as yet unre-\nsolved issue is that sawtooth events tend to occur when the\nIMF Bz is moderately to strongly negative while SMCs tend\nto develop when the IMF Bz is weakly to moderately\nnegative. Although notable exceptions to this ordering have\nbeen identified [e.g., Zhou et al., 2003] and other factors\nlike polar cap potential saturation [Siscoe et al., 2002;\nSiscoe et al., 2004], solar wind Mach number [Borovsky,\n2004], and ionospheric conductance and bowshock standoff\ndistance [Merkine et al., 2003] effects may be important\ncontributors to the overall efficiency of the solar wind-\nmagnetosphere coupling, on average sawtooth events ap-\npear to be more strongly driven than SMCs are. Therefore\nsawtooth substorms may result because the magnetosphere\nmay not be able to dissipate the energy input in a relatively\nsteady-state manner like it manages to during SMCs. We\ntherefore propose that sawtooth events are a manifestation\nof the magnetosphere\u2019s need to globally \u2018\u2018reset\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018recon-\nfigure\u2019\u2019 itself via substorms in a quasi-periodic manner\nwhen it is strongly driven. This naturally leads us to a\nnumber of additional questions: (1) Are the substorms\nspontaneous or are they triggered? (2) What controls the\nquasi-periodicity?\n[20] In order to explore these questions, we show IMF\nand solar wind data from the ACE spacecraft in Figure 6.\nThe IMF Bx, By, and Bz components are shown in the upper\nthree panels. The solar wind dynamic pressure (on a log\nscale) is shown in the fourth panel and the GOES-10 field\ninclination angle and Sym-H index are shown in the bottom\ntwo panels. The ACE data have been appropriately time-\nshifted and the times of the individual teeth are indicated\nwith solid vertical lines. It is apparent from the ACE data\nFigure 6. Interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind\ndata from the ACE spacecraft together with the GOES-10\nfield inclination angle and the Sym-H index.\nA01S90 HENDERSON ET AL.: THE 18 APRIL 2002 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n8 of 15\nA01S90\nthat there are a number of abrupt changes in the IMF in\naddition to a number of small to moderate sized fluctuations\nin the dynamic pressure. Nevertheless, it is difficult to see a\nclear one-to-one correspondence between these disturbances\nand the sawteeth. Although one could perhaps associate a\npressure enhancement with the onset of each tooth (as was\ndone by Lee et al. [2004]), there appears to be many more\nfluctuations in the IMF\/SW than there are teeth. Finally,\nthere appears to be neither an obvious 2\u20134 hour periodicity\nto the IMF\/SW disturbances nor an obvious sawtooth\nwaveform in the the pressure profile. Nevertheless, we did\nfind compelling evidence that at least one of the teeth could\nhave been triggered by a solar wind pressure pulse.\n[21] In Figure 8 we present a subset of the data shown in\nFigure 6 together with magnetic field data from the Polar\nspacecraft. The ACE, GOES-10, and Sym-H data are\nplotted for the time interval between 0200 and 1000 UT,\nwhile the Polar magnetic field data are shown for times\nbetween 0400 and 0700 UT, which spans the onset of the\n0530 UT tooth. At 0530 UT, Polar was near the SM\nequatorial plane in the prenoon dayside sector between\ngeosynchronous orbit and the magnetopause. Note that just\nprior to the 0530 UT onset, Polar observed an abrupt change\nin both the field direction and strength. This behavior is\nconsistent with the sudden entry of Polar into the magneto-\nsheath caused by the impact of a pressure pulse. If we\nexamine the dynamic pressure in Figures 6 and 8, we can\nsee a (surprisingly) weak disturbance near 0530 UT. Thus it\nis quite possible that the pressure pulse that caused the\nexcursion of Polar into the sheath was not well observed by\nACE in its halo orbit around the L1 point, a point that has\nbeen made in previous substorm triggering studies [e.g.,\nLyons et al., 1997; Blanchard et al., 2000].\n[22] In order to examine this hypothesis in more detail, in\nFigure 7 we compare the solar wind dynamic pressure seen\nat ACE with that seen at the Wind spacecraft which was\nsituated very far off the Earth-Sun line in the +YGSM\ndirection at RGSM = (10.9, 191.7, 75.1) RE. In this figure,\nthe ACE data is still time-shifted, but we have not applied\nany time shift to the Wind data because it is so close to the\nXGSM = 0 axis to begin with. Note that the gross features\nseen at ACE and Wind are similar but, as expected,\nsignificant differences in structure and timing exist between\nthe two spacecraft. Clearly, the distribution of the pressure\nin the solar wind varies temporally, spatially or both.\nNevertheless, the Wind data do show a much more prom-\ninent pressure pulse in the 0600\u20130630 UT time frame.\nGiven the large off-axis distance of Wind and the fact that\nSW discontinuities are often oblique relative to the Earth-\nSun line, the pressure pulse in the Wind data could certainly\nhave been the same one that we associate with the Polar\nsheath excursion prior to the 0530 event.\n[23] Finally, in Figure 9 we introduce IMAGE\/MENA\nand IMAGE\/HENA energetic neutral atom (ENA) imager\ndata during the sawtooth event together with composition\ndata from the Polar\/CAMMICE MICS instrument. Also\nshown are the ACE Bz and dynamic pressure curves, proton\nfluxes from two of the LANL detectors, and the GOES-10\nfield inclination angle and the Sym-H index. The HENA\nand MENA data are shown in more condensed angle versus\ntime plots rather than images. The MENA data shows (polar\nangle summed) ENA flux as a function of spin phase and\ntime, while the HENA panels show (spin phase summed)\nENA flux as a function of polar angle and time. In these\nformats the gross temporal development of the ENA fluxes\ncan more easily be monitored as a function of time. We note\nfrom the HENA hydrogen panel that each tooth was\nassociated with a stepwise increase in the ENA emission\nrate which indicates that each tooth was associated with an\ninjection of energetic protons into the ring current. The\nFigure 7. Solar wind dynamic pressure variations seen at\nACE and Wind.\nFigure 8. Interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind\ndata from the ACE spacecraft together with Sym-H index\nand magnetic field measurements at Polar. During the onset\nof the 0530 UT event, Polar was situated in the dayside\nprenoon sector. Just prior to the onset, Polar suddenly\nentered the sheath suggesting that the magnetosphere was\ndynamically compressed by a pressure pulse just prior to the\nonset of the substorm.\nA01S90 HENDERSON ET AL.: THE 18 APRIL 2002 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n9 of 15\nA01S90\nlower-energy MENA measurements also show a modula-\ntion in ENA fluxes associated with the individual teeth,\nbut the fluxes do not always increase in a stepwise\nmanner. The HENA oxygen [Mitchell et al., 2003] panel\nshows that each tooth was also associated with bursts of\noxygen ENAs. This is consistent with the in situ measure-\nments of low charge state oxygen ions (of ionospheric\norigin) made with the MICS instrument. From the HENA\nand MICS observations it is clear that sawtooth events are\nassociated with the injection of oxygen-rich energetic\nparticles into the ring current.\n[24] IMAGE\/HENA hydrogen (19\u201360 keV) and oxygen\n(52\u2013222 keV) ENA images acquired before, during and\nafter the 1135 UT onset are presented in Figure 10. A\nFigure 9.

This behavior\nis entirely consistent with that observed in a previous Polar\nENA superposed epoch study of storm-time injections\n[Reeves and Henderson, 2001]. Furthermore, the sequence\nof images shown in Figure 10 visually confirms our earlier\nconclusion that the onset of the teeth are not globally\ndispersionless but rather propagate away from the nightside.\nThe oxygen images shown in the right hand column also\nindicate that oxygen emissions during this onset were\nenhanced in the dusk to midnight sector. (Note that due to\nscattering in the HENA entrance aperture foil, oxygen is not\nwell resolved spatially and localized features will therefore\nappear to be considerably blurred.)\n3. Discussion and Conclusions\n[25] In our analysis of the 18 April 2002 storm-time\nsawtooth interval, we have shown that the strong dipolari-\nzation signatures observed at geosynchronous orbit are\nconfined to the nightside and that there is therefore not a\nglobally simultaneous response for each tooth. We have also\nshown that the injection signatures are not globally dis-\npersionless for each tooth. In fact there is significant\ndispersion associated with each flux increase and this\ndispersion is consistent with an unusually wide (in azimuth)\nsubstorm injection region centered approximately in the\ndusk to midnight sector. It is interesting to note that such\nwide injection regions at geosynchronous orbit can easily be\nachieved in the empirical Kp-dependent injection boundary\nmodel. As discussed by Singer et al. [1983], the inner edge\nof the plasma sheet lies inside of geosynchronous orbit for\nhigh values of the Kp index and as shown by Mauk and\nMcIlwain [1974] and Mauk and Meng [1983], the injection\nboundary is pushed entirely inside of geosynchronous orbit\non the nightside for Kp levels as low as 5. Such Kp levels\nare consistent with geomagnetic storm conditions in general\nand with the 18 April 2002 event in particular (Kp levels for\nthe day were: 7\u0003, 7\u0001, 6\u0001, 6\u0001, 4+, 5\u0001, 4\u0003, 4+).\n[26] In order to demonstrate that the dispersion patterns\nobserved in Figures 2 and 3 are consistent with the standard\ninjection boundary picture, we simulated the dispersion\npatterns expected at the six LANL geosynchronous space-\ncraft for the 1135 UT onset using the Mauk and Meng\n[1983] Kp-dependent injection boundary model. We used a\nsimple centered dipole field and a Kp-dependent, shielded\nVolland-Stern electric field to trace electrons and protons\nbackward in time (to the onset time of 1135 UT) from each\nspacecraft. For the simulation, we restricted the azimuthal\ndefinition of the injection boundary to be between 1800 and\n2400 MLT (i.e., we assume the dispersionless injection\noccurred in the dusk to midnight sector), and we assumed\nthat all of the particles were equatorially mirroring (zero\nsecond invariant). The results are presented in Figure 11a\nwhich is similar in format to the merged MPA\/SOPA\/ESP\nspectrograms shown in Figure 2. The color-coding indicates\nhow far (radially) behind the injection boundary the par-\nticles originated, with red being closest to the boundary. If\nthe particle originated more than 10 RE tailward of the\ninjection boundary, it was colored gray.\nFigure 10. IMAGE\/HENA ENA images spanning the\ntime of onset of the 1135 UT tooth. The view is from the\nnorthern hemisphere with local magnetic noon to the left\nand local magnetic midnight to the right. Note the westward\npropagating injection on the duskside (bottom of each\nimage) from the nightside to the noon meridian in the\nhydrogen images between the third and sixth frames.\nA01S90 HENDERSON ET AL.: THE 18 APRIL 2002 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n11 of 15\nA01S90\n[27] It is important to note that the colored areas in\nFigure 11a do not represent flux levels or even flux pertur-\nbation levels (as in Figures 2 and 3). Instead, they indicate\nwhether or not particles of a given species and energy,\noriginating from behind an injection boundary (between\ndusk and midnight), had access to a given spacecraft at a\ngiven time. In essence they represent energy- and species-\ndependent arrival time \u2018\u2018curves\u2019\u2019 for each spacecraft. The\nmultivalued nature of the regions in the horizontal direction\narise due to the periodic drift motion of the particles. For\nexample, the bands of dispersed curves seen at higher\nenergies in both the electron and proton panels represent\nthe routinely observed injection-associated drift echoes (e.g.,\nsee Figure 9 of Mauk and Meng [1983]). These curves are\nhighly idealized in Figure 11a because (1) we have only\nconsidered equatorially mirroring particles, and (2) we have\nnot taken into account energy dispersion within the energy\npassbands of the LANL detectors. In reality, both of these\nfactors will tend to smear the signals together in such a way\nthat only the first several drift echoes can easily be separated.\n[28] Because Figure 11a shows us when we should\nexpect the injected particles to arrive at each spacecraft\n(given the assumed injection model), the patterns can be\ncompared directly to those shown in Figure 3. Note that\nsince Figures 2 and 3 show real flux perturbation levels,\nthe arrival of obvious injection-associated flux enhance-\nments will only be visible in the perturbation maps: (1)\nfor energies that were actually injected, and (2) for\nenergies that actually experienced a net change in their\nflux levels relative to the background flux levels. In\nFigure 11b, we have reproduced the dispersion curves\nfrom Figure 3 only for the 1135 UT injection. Note that\nalthough the model we used is quite crude, the simulated\nresults in Figure 11a are qualitatively very similar to the\nactual dispersion features shown in Figure 11b. This\ndemonstrates very clearly that sawtooth-like dispersion\naround the globe can easily be achieved with the standard\nKp-dependent injection boundary model and is consistent\nwith an injection of particles on the nightside (although\nsome teeth may also be associated with injections that\nencroach somewhat past the terminators into the dayside).\n[29] In this paper we have also shown that the auroral\ndistribution was characterized by a dynamic double oval\nconfiguration, which was observed to gradually thin down\nin unison with the gradual flux decreases at geosynchronous\norbit. The onset of each tooth was associated with a\nlocalized explosive brightening in the dusk to midnight\nsector on the lower branch of the double oval, and this\nwas followed by rapid poleward and azimuthal expansion\nand the gradual emergence of a new expanded double oval\nconfiguration. The cycle then repeats itself. We note also\nthat eastward propagating omega bands were a prominent\nfeature of the auroral distribution and that due to the cyclical\nnature of the event, recovery phase features from one\nsubstorm can be seen merging into the growth phase of\nthe next. Phenomenologically, the auroral configuration\nFigure 11. (a) Simulated dispersion patterns at geosynchronous orbit for the 1135 UT tooth. (b)\nObserved dispersion patterns for the 1135 UT tooth.\nA01S90 HENDERSON ET AL.: THE 18 APRIL 2002 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n12 of 15\nA01S90\nlooks much like that of an SMC except that here the double\noval cyclically thins and expands (i.e., polar cap area\ncyclically increases and contracts) and is punctuated peri-\nodically by substorm expansions. This is consistent with the\nsimultaneous operation of both a loading-unloading (sub-\nstorms) and directly driven magnetospheric response.\n[30] In a recent paper, Lee et al. [2004] suggest that the\ndramatic geosynchronous energetic particle flux variations\nduring the 18 April 2002 and other sawtooth events were\nnot due to a sequence of quasi-periodic substorms but\ninstead were driven directly by external pressure variations.\nAlthough they noted that \u2018\u2018some substorm effects could\nsimultaneously have occurred on the nightside,\u2019\u2019 they fur-\nther suggest that \u2018\u2018the solar wind pressure effect was the\ndominant cause of the sawtooth oscillations.\u2019\u2019 Note that this\nis a very different scenario from one in which the teeth are\nsubstorms which may or may not have been triggered by\nexternal pressure (or other types of) variations. In the Lee et\nal. [2004] scenario, the sudden increase and gradual\ndecrease of the geosynchronous fluxes associated with each\ntooth is directly driven or modulated by the externally\nimposed pressure variations.\n[31] In our analysis of the IMF\/SW data from ACE and\nWind, we find that the event occurred during a prolonged\ninterval of continuously southward, moderate-strong, and\nreasonably steady IMF with numerous small to medium\nsized pressure fluctuations. However, we did not find the\nsolar wind pressure to be modulated in a characteristic\nsawtooth waveform. Although many pressure enhancements\ncan be identified (particularly on a log-scale), some were\nshort-lived pulses occurring on increasing, decreasing, or\nflat trends, while others were followed by net increasing or\ndecreasing trends. In addition, the strongest pressure\nenhancements were not observed in association with the\nlargest flux enhancements. Finally, while it is impossible to\nknow exactly what pressure profile actually impinged upon\nthe Earth, the available data indicates that there were more\npressure enhancements than there were teeth. These obser-\nvations alone tend to argue against a directly driven sce-\nnario; however, this argument is considerably strengthened\nwhen one considers the magnetospheric data presented here.\n[32] As we already mentioned, the onset of each tooth\nwas associated with an embedded substorm onset on the\nlower branch of a thinned double-oval auroral configura-\ntion. These onsets were not global in nature but were rather\nlocalized (approximately) to the nightside. In addition, we\ndo not find evidence that substorm onsets occurred in the\nabsence of a geosynchronous tooth onset. In other words,\nduring the interval of good quality auroral imaging, we find\na one-to-one correlation between auroral substorm onsets\nand the geosynchronous energetic particle flux increases\ndefining the start of each tooth. In addition, as we discussed\nabove the particle dispersion observed at geosynchronous\norbit is fully consistent with a large-scale injection of\nparticles on the nightside of the Earth. Together these\nobservations very strongly indicate that the initial sharp\nflux increases were associated with impulsive, dynamical\nsubstorm injection events.\n[33] It is also interesting to note that sawtooth waveforms\nalways occur in a consistent, systematic manner with large,\nrapid flux increases separated by intervals of gradual flux\ndecreases. They do not occur in the reverse sense with\ngradual increases separated by rapid decreases. Since the\nsolar wind dynamic pressure input during sawtooth events\ntypically does not itself display a dramatic well-defined\nsawtooth waveform (e.g., none of the four events studied by\nLee et al. [2004] have well-defined sawtooth waveforms in\nthe dynamic pressure), we surmise that if dynamic pressure\ndrives sawtooth events, the pressure enhancements must\ninduce a magnetospheric response that is far more coherent\nthan the input signal. In addition, as we have already\nmentioned, there are often far more enhancements in the\ndynamic pressure than there are teeth. From this we surmise\nthat the response must also be nonlinear in the sense that\nonce a tooth develops, it does not become interrupted by\nanother tooth until it has undergone the cyclical response we\nhave described above. These two points also argue rather\nstrongly against a directly driven scenario but are still quite\nconsistent with one in which a 2\u20134 hour magnetospheric\nprocess (e.g., a substorm) is triggered at regular intervals.\nThis could be achieved if the magnetosphere became\nunstable to external or internal triggering at 2\u20134 hour\nintervals.\n[34] Nevertheless, we certainly do not discount the idea\nthat external pressure (or other) variations can modulate\nauroral emissions or other magnetospheric behavior. For\nexample, a shock-induced globally dispersionless proton\nflux increase that occurred near the end of the 11 August\n2000 sawtooth event has been presented recently by Lee\nand Lyons [2004] (see their Figure 9). In addition, there\nis a body of evidence emerging that suggests that under\nstrongly driven conditions, the solar wind-magnetosphere\ncoupling may become dramatically modified relative to\nweakly driven conditions. For example, Siscoe et al.\n[2002] and Siscoe et al. [2004] have shown that when\nthe transpolar potential is at or near saturation, the\nnominal Chapman-Ferraro currents can be \u2018\u2018usurped\u2019\u2019 by\nregion-1 currents. In such a configuration, the solar wind\ndynamic pressure is held off directly by these region-1\ncurrents which map into the ionosphere. When this\nhappens, pressure variations could therefore be expected\nto directly affect the ionospheric field aligned currents\n(and\/or conductivity). It is interesting to note that this\neffect could potentially be associated with (dayside?)\nportions of the double oval configuration that is promi-\nnently observed during strongly driven times, although\nthe plausibility of such a connection should be explored\nin more detail in future work.\n[35] Another suggestion that has recently been proposed\nis that the magnetospheric response to solar wind\/IMF\ndriving conditions may be different during sawtooth\nintervals because statistically, sawtooth events tend to\noccur when the solar wind Mach number is anomalously\nlow which \u2018\u2018creates an unusual magnetosheath flow with\nextremely low beta values\u2019\u2019 [Borovsky, 2004]. Such con-\nditions would also be expected to move the bowshock\nsunward which would also contribute to transpolar po-\ntential saturation effects as discussed by Merkine et al.\n[2003] and Siscoe et al. [2004]. In addition, the jump\nconditions across the bowshock may become substantially\nmore complex for weak (low Mach number) shock\nconditions (J. E. Borovsky, private communication,\n2004). Although more work needs to be done in order\nto ascertain exactly how these ideas may modify the\nA01S90 HENDERSON ET AL.: THE 18 APRIL 2002 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n13 of 15\nA01S90\nglobal response, these studies certainly suggest that the\nglobal response during sawtooth events may be dramat-\nically modified relative to less strongly driven conditions.\n[36] However, despite the likelihood of anomalous solar\nwind magnetosphere coupling during sawtooth events and\nthe potential for shock-induced globally dispersionless\nflux increases, in the present study we find extremely\ncompelling evidence that the teeth studied here are in fact\nsubstorms. We also find strong evidence that at least one\nof the teeth (the 0530 UT event) was triggered by a\npressure pulse which moved the magnetopause across the\nPolar spacecraft just prior to onset. These observations\nsuggest that when a tooth occurs, the magnetosphere\nbecomes unresponsive to further triggers (or internal\ninstabilities) for a 2\u20133 hour sawtooth growth-phase\nperiod. We therefore propose that the periodicity of\nsawtooth events is determined by the time it takes the\nmagnetosphere to be driven past some stability threshold.\nIndividual teeth could then occur either spontaneously via\nsome type of internal instability, or they could be\ntriggered by external pressure or IMF variations. Under\nthis hypothesis, the sawtooth periodicity is set by the\nmagnetosphere because it only becomes receptive to\npotential triggers (or internal instabilities) during a small\ntime window near the end of each growth phase. This\nidea can also explain the quasi-periodicity in the sense\nthat a tooth could be triggered anywhere within such a\ntime window.\n[37] In conclusion, from our analysis of magnetospheric\nand auroral data acquired during the 18 April 2002 event\nwe find strong support for the contention that sawtooth\nevents are actually sequences of recurrent quasi-periodic\nsubstorms. Also we suggest that sawtooth events can be\nviewed as a magnetospheric mode similar to SMCs\nexcept that for sawtooth events, the flow of energy from\nthe solar wind into the magnetosphere becomes too large\nto dissipate without the (literally) periodic occurrence of\nsubstorms. Stated differently, it appears that the magne-\ntosphere is continuously \u2018\u2018driven\u2019\u2019 toward substorm-like\nreconfigurations in order to \u2018\u2018reset\u2019\u2019 itself at periodic\nintervals.\n[38] Acknowledgments.
