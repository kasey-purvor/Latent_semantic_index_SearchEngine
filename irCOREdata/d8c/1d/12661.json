Thirty Texel x Suffolk lambs used in this study had previously received diets (91 days) containing either high dose SY (HSY; 6.30 mg Se\/kg DM) or an unsupplemented control (C; 0.13 mg Se\/kg DM). Following the period of supplementation all lambs were then offered a complete pelleted diet, without additional Se (0.15 mg Se\/kg DM), for 42 days. At enrollment and 21 and 42 days later, five lambs from each treatment were blood sampled, euthanased and samples of heart, liver, kidney and skeletal muscle (Longissimus Dorsi and Psoas Major) tissue were retained. Total Se concentration in whole blood and tissues was significantly (P < 0.001) higher in HSY lambs at all time points that had previously received long term exposure to high dietary concentrations of SY. The distribution of total Se and the proportions of total Se comprised as SeMet and SeCys differed between tissues, treatment and time points. Total Se was greatest in HSY liver and kidney (22.64 and 18.96 mg Se\/kg DM, respectively) and SeCys comprised the greatest proportion of total Se. Conversely, cardiac and skeletal muscle (Longissimus Dorsi and Psoas Major) tissues had lower total Se concentration (10.80, 7.02 and 7.82 mg Se\/kg DM, respectively) and SeMet was the predominant selenized amino acid. Rates of Se clearance in HSY liver (307 \u00b5g Se\/day) and kidney (238 \u00b5g Se\/day) were higher compared with HSY cardiac tissue (120 \u00b5g Se\/day) and skeletal muscle (20 \u00b5g Se\/day).
