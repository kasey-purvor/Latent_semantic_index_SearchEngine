It \nallocates a scarce resource but independently of prices or any market information. In \nanalysing the effects this allocative mechanism has on housing supply (or, indeed, the supply \nof buildings for any given use) we need to think carefully about what exactly it is that \nplanning allocates and whether, in its operation, it creates a constraint on the supply of what \nit is allocating. In the British case, our planning system does not operate on the supply of \nhousing directly but indirectly via the constraint imposed on land supply. Given the income \nelasticity of demand for space this has policy implications perhaps even more serious than is \nacknowledged by Barker. \n \nKate Barker in her, now, four reports (Barker, 2003, 2004, 2006a & b) has rendered all of us \nan extraordinary service. These reports brought a sharp economic policy focus to a previously \nalmost wholly neglected issue but an issue of real importance. In addition they brought \ntogether a huge and valuable body of analysis and evidence. They are a resource for both \npolicy makers and urban economists, not just in the U.K. but in the world at large. I have \nalready cited them widely in policy analysis for China. \n \nThese Barker Reviews have changed the context within which planning is discussed and \nanalysed, and the recommendations are already feeding through to influence policy. The \nanalysis provided in the paper in this issue is consistent with the body of the work embodied \nin the reviews but focuses specifically on the issue of whether the inelasticity of supply of \nnew housing in England is significantly related to the working of the English planning system \n- broadly defined. \n \nA discussant\u2019s job is not to offer an undiluted paean of praise for a paper but I would like to \nemphasis the importance of Barker\u2019s contribution and note my general agreement with the \nanalysis presented here. I strongly agree that a system of land use regulation is essential if for \nno other reason than the endemic problems of market failure associated with land markets, \nalthough I acknowledge that planning is about addressing more than just market failure. \nHowever the problems of market failure addressed by planning are endemic to land markets \nas a result of the particular characteristics of land. Because every parcel of land has a fixed \nlocation and significant transactions costs associated with it, owners or occupiers are locked \ninto individual plots and their investments are illiquid. Moreover their enjoyment of their \nrights of occupation is inevitably tied up with the actions of neighbouring plot occupants and \nall parcels are different from all other parcels because of their particular location. A parcel\u2019s \nlocation determines consumption of a wide range of (local) public goods (such as less crime) \nand amenities (such as better views) available at specific locations, as well, of course, as \ndriving the central motor of modern theories of urban land prices, accessibility to jobs. \n \nAs a result, there are important and particular forms of externalities and other potential forms \nof market failure. Because of the very large number of individuals involved, transactions \ncosts for individual plot owners to combine or co-ordinate are typically large relative to \nindividual effects, making Coasian solutions to resolving these problems of market failure \ndifficult. Policy interventions in the form of fiscal measures and incentives have perhaps been \nunder explored, one suspects partly because of the relative lack of attention mainstream \neconomics and the education of economists gives to land. Partly as a result perhaps, systems \nof land market regulation have tended to evolve more from a combination of urban design, \n 2 \narchitectural and socialist planning intellectual traditions, than from the traditions of market \nregulation more familiar to economists. \n \nAs I have argued elsewhere (Cheshire and Sheppard, 2002; 2004) not only does the fixed \nlocation of land lead to particular types of market failure but it also generates important \ndistributional effects, normally ignored. Consumption of a wide range of important goods and \namenities, often thought to be provided free, actually is conditioned on individual incomes \nand wealth because the value of these attributes is capitalised into house prices. Thus, the \nability to benefit from better schools or the amenities generated by land use planning is \ndetermined by household income. As a result amenity values generated by Greenbelts \ndifferentially benefit richer house owners, producing an even more unequal distribution of \nwelfare (measured as equivalent income) than the incomes of home owners themselves \n(Cheshire and Sheppard, 2002). \n \nWhat needs to be recognised is that while planning is about other things as well, it is \nfundamentally an economic activity. Our planning system allocates a scarce resource \u2013 land \nfor urban development \u2013 but without any regard for prices or any market information. In \nanalysing the effects of this allocative mechanism on housing supply (or, indeed, the supply \nof buildings for any given use) we need to think carefully about what exactly it is that a \nparticular planning system allocates and whether, in the allocative process, it creates a \nconstraint on the supply of what it is allocating.  \n \nUnderstanding this, I think, is critical to understanding the different economic impact of \ndifferent systems of land market regulation (planning). Kate Barker cites the systems of \nGermany and the Netherlands but let me also include that of the US in the comparison with \nEngland\u2019s.  I agree that the fundamental structure of England\u2019s planning system was set by \nthe 1947 Act. This was in the then social and political context of a utopian effort to rebuild \nBritain\u2019s economic and social system on socialist lines and reflected the still recent successful \nexperience of state direction of a war economy. Economic as well as land use planning were \non the agenda although it was land use planning that was implemented.  \n \nNot only did the 1947 Act nationalise development rights but it set certain policy objectives, \nparticularly that of \u2018urban containment\u2019 (Hall et al, 1973). It established a system for \nallocating not numbers or square feet of housing or offices but of allocating the area of \ndevelopable land with the aim of deliberately restricting (for perceived social and \nenvironmental purposes) the spread of urban areas. Land allocation was converted into \nnumbers of houses only by assuming fixed densities of development. As you would expect \nwith a regulatory\/planning system coming from the intellectual traditions that it did, it dealt \nin physical units and measures such as numbers of households, jobs and densities and it \nexplicitly excluded any consideration of market signals or measures of market demand or \nsupply.  As planning practice has developed, price information has been deemed to be \u2018not a \nmaterial consideration\u2019 for decision-making by planners, and so ignored. The current move to \ninclude measures of \u2018affordability\u2019 in land supply decisions is the first attempt to include any \nmarket information in the planning process. \n \nSome alternative systems of land use planning \nThe Netherlands and Germany operate within a somewhat different system \u2013 the Master plan \ntradition. In this system there is very close control of what can be built on any site, but the \ndeveloper can just get on and build it without seeking \u2018development permission\u2019 \u2013 so long as \nwhat they are building conforms to the requirements set down for the particular site. In \nBritain any change from the status quo legally defined as \u2018development\u2019 \u2013 which would \ninclude not just construction but changing the use of a shop from selling holidays to selling \nhouses \u2013 is subject to \u2018development control\u2019 and needs individual planning permission. These \nsystems are not so radically different as this description sounds since there is, in a British \n 3 \ncontext, a local plan and what is planned for a given area of land will influence the outcome \nof the development control process. But the structure of decision making is different and the \nBritish system is arguably more open to political influence. A second more fundamental \ndifference between planning in England compared to Germany or the Netherlands is the \nobligation on local governments in those countries to provide a supply of land for \ndevelopment. Historically this has probably been most marked in the Netherlands although \nthere has been growing political pressure for constraint of urban development over the past \n10 years. In the Netherlands, one of the most important functions of local governments \nhistorically was land drainage (see Needham, 1992) \u2013 \u2018producing land\u20191. This has continued \nto the present to influence attitudes to land so that in the Netherlands land supply is treated \nmore as a utility, a necessary feature of life which it is the job of government to ensure is \nadequately supplied. Although the highest density country of any size in Europe and a rich \ncountry too, housing in the Netherlands (and in Germany) is both of high quality and \nsignificantly cheaper relative to incomes than is the case in England. The most recent data in \nStatistics Sweden (2005) show new build houses being 38 percent larger in the Netherlands \nand 40 percent larger in Germany than in the UK. In the Netherlands the price per square \nmetre was 45 percent less than in the UK. No directly comparable price information is \navailable for Germany but there (OECD, 2004) the real price of houses fell in both the \ndecades of the 1980s and 1990s and was completely stable over the whole period 1971 to \n2002, compared to an annual percentage rate of increase in the UK of 3.6 \u2013 the highest for \nany OECD country. Over the same 30-year period German real household disposable \nincomes increased at 2.6 percent a year compared to 2.3 percent in the Netherlands and 2.9 \npercent in the UK (OECD, 2004). In the Netherlands real house prices rose during the 1970s, \nfell at an average rate of 2.2 percent a year during the 1990s but then rose sharply in the \n1990s.  \n \n In England the overriding objective of policy has been urban containment (as has been \ndeveloping in a few areas of the US in recent years \u2013 see Phillips and Goodstein, 2000). This \nnecessarily entails the restriction of the supply of urban land. Moreover, with our centralised \nfiscal system, local authorities have an effective fiscal disincentive to allow urban \ndevelopment. They have statutory obligations to provide services for new houses and \nresidents but no direct return to their tax revenues since so high a proportion of local property \ntaxes are subject to re-distribution by central government and property taxes account for such \na small proportion of local government revenues. Even though this system restricts the supply \nof land relative to demand, however, it is only an indirect restriction on the supply of (new) \nhouses. It does not directly restrict the supply of dwellings. \n \nIn the US the planning system is institutionally somewhat different again, since it is a zoning \nsystem. This gives the system something in common with the Master Planning system but \ncontrol of individual sites is substantially less detailed. There is a facet, however, which is \nsomething like the British system since it is possible, in principle, to get zoning waivers by \napplying to the local zoning board but these are frequently politically impossible and are \nalways expensive to obtain. If development conforms to the general requirements of the rules \noperating for a particular zone (and conforms to local building codes) it can go ahead. The \ndecentralised fiscal system provides a strong incentive to allow commercial development but \nsome disincentive to allow denser residential development. Historically these zoning powers \nhave been used to restrict development for lower income households by imposing high \nminimum lot size requirements and making subdivision of existing lots very expensive or \nimpossible. New residential development, even in a high housing cost region such as the \nBoston metropolitan area, is with a mean lot size of an acre.  \n \n                                                 \n1\n There have been increasing signs of change in the Netherlands since about 2000 with growing pressure to \nconstrain development and establish urban containment policies. \n 4 \nThe real difference in economic terms between the US and British (and Dutch, German) \nsystems, therefore, is that, with just some few exceptions such as Portland, the US system \ndoes not control the supply of land, it in effect controls the number of houses+land bundles \nby means of either minimum lot size requirements or making subdivision of lots too \nexpensive to occur. In the past, given the supply of land and the ability to develop new \nsubdivisions on the edge of existing urban areas which then got their own zoning powers, this \ndid not have significant effects on prices. It produced low density leapfrogging development \nbut it did not restrict the total supply of houses.  As Glaeser et al (2005) have shown, \nhowever, it has recently been increasingly constraining the supply of housing in the North \nEast and West coast regions as whole regions get \u2018built out\u2019 and existing communities \nbecome more restrictive. This seems to be happening, however, because of regionally \ndiffering combinations of minimum lot sizes and the high costs \u2013 pecuniary and political \u2013 of \ngetting zoning ordinance wavers to permit the subdivision of existing built lots. Housing land \nis there but in large gardens and protected areas so it cannot be built on or developed at \nhigher densities. Indeed a striking finding of  Glaeser and Gyourko (2003) is that the implicit \nprice of additional garden space in parts of New England appeared to be negative, implying, \nif true, that house owners were being constrained to consume more land than they would \nchoose to if left free to choose optimal \u2018house-land bundles\u2019. \n \nWhat happens if you control land supply? \nThis is the central point of my argument. Housing is a complex, indeed a very complex good \nconsisting of many attributes bundled into one composite good. This, of course, is the central \ninsight of hedonic approaches to analysing house prices and housing markets, in wide \napplication since the theoretical developments of Rosen (1974). There must now have been \nthousands of hedonic studies of housing markets and I would claim it is an interesting \nexample of an area of economics in which there has been something very closely akin to \n\u2018scientific progress\u2019. Data sets, statistical techniques, experience and computing power have \nall progressed so that the state of the art studies are increasingly good and believable. They \nseem to me to show that housing market search processes and price determination are really \nvery sophisticated and consistent with there being pretty good information and well \nfunctioning markets. One recent development has been the insights gained from analysing the \ninteraction effects of variables. Thus, Anderson and West (2006) find not one price for access \nto parks and open space in Minneapolis\/St Paul but a price which varies with the local \ndensity, with local incomes, demographic structure and distance from the edge of the city. \nYou can interpret this as implying that while the price of access to parks varies according to \nlocal conditions this is really because the housing attribute \u2018distance from open space\u2019 varies \nover the city according to how scarce space in gardens is, how scarce space at the edge of the \ncity is, etc. Cheshire and Sheppard (2004) find that the capitalised price of given school \nquality varies with the suitability of a house to hold children and, moreover, evidence \nsuggesting that it is not just current school quality that commands a price but expected school \nquality. \n \nNo credible hedonic study has been done that does not find that space internal to a house is \nnot just a statistically significant variable but a highly influential variable in determining the \noverall price of a house. There are fewer studies which include garden or plot size as an \nattribute. Until the development of GIS software and digitised maps, measuring the \ndimensions of gardens included with structures was a very labour intensive task. Of the few \nstudies before 2000 to include plot size that by Jackson et al (1984) was one of the earliest. \nThis study found a significant price being paid for more garden space \u2013 a finding common to \nthe great majority of studies which have included this attribute\n2\n.  \n \n                                                 \n2\n The study of Glaeser and Gyourko (2003) was a form of hedonic. This found a positive price paid for gardens \nbut a negative price paid for additional garden space over the mean garden size. \n 5 \nAnother difficulty with including garden size as an attribute is that underlying urban \neconomic theory predicts there will not be a single price but that the price of residential space \nwill vary systematically with accessibility to jobs (commonly assumed to be concentrated in \nthe centre of the city). Cheshire and Sheppard (2004), using the model defined in (1) below, \nnot only found that the estimates of the rent function parameters were significant - implying \nthat there was a statistically significant price being paid for (more) land with the price \nvarying with both distance and direction from the city centre - but, in addition, for a given \nsize of garden, a higher price was paid if it was squarer rather than long and narrow. These \nresults provide strong evidence people get welfare from, and care about, space, in both \nhouses and gardens. They pay more to consume more private space and so, implicitly, live at \nlower densities, all else equal. This result is consistent with Song and Knaap (2004) who \nagain find a positive and significant price paid for houses built at lower density, all else equal. \n \n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf078\n\uf02d\n\uf071\uf02b\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf06c\n\uf02d\n\uf0d7\uf062\uf02b\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf06c\n\uf02d\n\uf0d7\uf062\uf02b\uf0d7\uf062\uf02b\uf03d\n\uf079\n\uf02d \uf078\n\uf0ce\n\uf06c\n\uf0ce\n\uf06c\n\uf0ce\n\uf079\n\uf0e5\uf0e5\uf0e5\n1L\n,xr\n1q1q\nqK\n1P\nEk 2\nk\nk\nCj 1\nj\nj\nDi\nii\n21\n         (1)  (1) \nwhere: \n \nP \n \n= \n \nsales price of structure \n \nqi, qj  qk \n \n= \n \nStructure, location and education-specific \ncharacteristics \n \nK, \uf062i, \uf06ci, \uf079, \uf078 \n \n= \n \nparameters to be estimated \n \nL \n \n= \n \nquantity of land included with structure \n \nD \n \n= \n \nset of indices of characteristics which are dichotomous \n \nC \n \n= \n \nset of indices of characteristics which are continuously \nvariable \nE = set of indices of characteristics measuring educational \nquality \n \nr(x,\uf071) \n \n= \n \nland rent function given by: \n \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029432 nx1 exr\n\uf062\uf02d\uf071\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf062\uf02b\uf062\uf0d7\n\uf0d7\uf062\uf03d\uf071\nsin\n,                                                             (2) \n \nwhere:   \nx = Distance from the city centre \n\uf071 = Angle of deflection from the city centre \nn = Number of \u2018ridges\u2019 in land value, representing radial asymmetries \n\uf062i = Estimated parameters of land value function \n \nThe logic of an hedonic approach to analysing house prices is that, since housing is a \ncomposite good, the total price of which is the aggregate of the prices of each individual \nattribute, we must think of separate demand and supply characteristics for each attribute. I \nwould further argue that even if we cannot presently identify these supply curves it is useful \n 6 \nto think about them in order to see what can be concluded about their likely form. The supply \nof some attributes, such as frontage on the river Thames or Hampstead Heath in London - \nmay be in naturally fixed supply. There are a fixed number of houses that provide such \nfrontage. The supply of other attributes may also be highly inelastic. If, for example, parents \nlooking for educational quality in fact seek to get access to not just a good state school but to \nthe best state school in their housing market area, then the supply of educational quality will \nbe highly inelastic. There can only be one best local school. Yet other attributes may be \nproduced by a quasi-industrial process and so be elastic in supply. Examples might be central \nheating, fitted kitchens or the number of rooms in a given total space. In the absence of any \nland market regulation one would assume that the supply of urban land would be in more or \nless perfectly elastic supply. There would be a significant mark-up over agricultural land \nbecause of the costs of providing transport and other infrastructure but such costs would be \nrelatively constant in real terms, so more urban land could always be provided at a given \nprice.  \n \nAs was shown in Cheshire and Sheppard (2005) this seems to be consistent with housing land \nprice data for England and Wales from 1892 to about 1955. Between 1892 and the last pre-\nWWII population census in 1931, there was a 61% increase in household numbers and a 25% \nincrease in real household incomes, but no increase in the real price of housing land.  \nBetween 1955 and 2002 the real price of housing land increased 11.1-fold but real house \nprices increased only 3.4-fold with nearly all that increase being since 1971\n3\n. The distinction \nbetween the English planning system and those of Germany, the Netherlands and the US that \nis particularly significant in economic terms is that the English system explicitly constrains \nthe supply of land, and has done so over a long period. The German and Dutch systems of \nland use planning, although they impose a strong regulatory framework, impose only a \nmodest constraint on supply. And as noted above, in the US, the system, where it restricts \nsupply, mainly restricts the supply of land+housing bundles and has effectively done so only \nfor a comparatively short time. The length of time a restriction is imposed is critical in the \nhousing market because of the durability of buildings and the small size of the flow of new \nbuild relative to total supply or stock. \n \nGiven the composite character of housing we should in principle think not just of the \ncharacteristics of the supply of individual attributes but also the structure of demand. Here \nthere is some evidence (Cheshire and Sheppard, 1998; Cheshire et al, 1999, for example) and \nthis suggests that the demand for space in houses, and externally in gardens, is highly income \nelastic: evaluated at mean incomes, estimates for three different housing markets over three \ndates were typically around 1.6 for internal space and 1.75 for garden space.  \n \nPolicy implications \nConceptualising the problem Barker poses in these terms seems to me to have implications \neven more uncomfortable than those in her conclusions. The demand for housing land is a \nderived demand, so our planning system only indirectly affects housing supply and the price \nof houses through its policy of containment and more recently densification. But household \nnumbers - apart from being unreliable in their projection and so a poor tool for forecasting \nhow many houses to build - would, even if known with perfect foresight, be only one factor \nin the relevant determinants of demand. If we are to provide stable house prices what we need \nto be able to predict is the effective demand for housing space and garden space given that it \nis the quantity of land that the system allocates. \n \nHere what evidence we have is discouraging. In Cheshire et al, 1999 we built a \n\u2018microsimulation\u2019 model for the English housing market: microsimulation in that it was built \n                                                 \n3\n 1980, the date in Kate Barker\u2019s figure at which the house price =100, was in fact a low point in the real house \nprice cycle, so perhaps the figure tends to overstate the trend increase since that date. \n 7 \nup from individual data on observed house prices and the incomes of occupants. It was crude \nin that it involved grossing up from estimates of just three regional housing markets \n(Darlington, Nottingham and Reading) but against that the stability of estimates of the \nstructure of demand over time and across these markets was reassuring. The model allowed \nfor induced household formation as house prices changed and for induced interregional \nmigration. \u2018Houses\u2019 were almost truly quality-constant except for the assumption that \ndensities would be constant at their current average. The purpose of the model was to \nestimate the impact on house prices not of housing numbers, but of housing land supply \n(possible because the demand for land was explicitly estimated and modelled). Demand for \nhouses was as normally modelled - determined by household numbers and incomes and the \nstructure of demand. It was an equilibrium model, so short term effects of interest rates etc \nwere not accounted for.  \n \nThe impact on house prices of any set of assumptions about changes in land supply, \nhousehold numbers or real incomes could be simulated, for England as a whole or \ndisaggregated by region with different assumed values for different regions. Two such \nscenarios are worth reporting. Both of these were for the period 1996 to 2016 and applied the \nthen recently announced planning policy of providing 60% of new housing on \u2018Brownfield\u2019 \nland. They involved no differences in assumptions across regions. For modelling purposes \nplanning policy was interpreted as providing 60% of any additional land within existing \nurban areas, with consequent increases in overall urban densities. Both Scenarios applied the \nthen projected increase in household numbers of 4.4 million by 2016 (HMSO, 1997). \nScenario 1, however, assumed no growth in real incomes over the period while Scenario 2 \nassumed real incomes grew by 25% - consistent with the observed trend growth between \n1986 and 1993. Household and income growth were assumed to be at the same rate in each \nregion although as noted above, different values for each region could have been incorporated \nif desired. These two Scenarios, although they embodied the same assumption about the \nBrownfield\/Greenfield mix and about the growth in household numbers, produced \nremarkably different forecasts of real house price increases. With real incomes constant, the \nincrease in real (quality-constant) house prices across England was 4.4%; assuming real \nincome growth at past trend rates produced a forecast increase of 131.9%. Thus in a world in \nwhich the supply of land is restricted, the real driver of real house prices seems to be income \nnot household numbers and this stems from the income elasticity of demand for space. \n \nConclusions \nThus while I largely support Barker\u2019s analysis, my conclusion with respect to the impact of \nthe present system on housing affordability is more pessimistic. So long as we constrict the \nsupply of land and the demand for space is as income elastic as it appears to be, projections \nof household numbers \u2013 even were they accurate \u2013 would be little help in guiding our system \nto improve housing affordability. Houses are not simple goods and demand is not just for \nquality-constant houses (something quite imperfectly measured in current house price \nindicators) but for improving house quality, including more space. Such improvements in \nturn imply more land for housing and in the absence of such an increase in land supply but \nrising incomes, average real house prices will continue to trend upwards. In turn this implies \na pressing need both to take much more explicit account of price signals in determining land \nsupply and reassessing current policies of densification and Greenbelts. Even stabilising \nhousing affordability is inconsistent with requiring 60% of new residential development to be \non brownfield land \u2013 especially in the high demand housing markets with less brownfield \nspace in southern England.  \n \nThis does not imply a free for all for current non-urban land. As we both agree, there are \ngood reasons for regulating land markets and where building occurs. Some non-urban land \nhas high amenity or environmental value. Some, however, does not and policies with respect \n 8 \nto such low amenity non-urban land, especially adjoining existing urban areas, need to be \nurgently reviewed. \n \nReferences \nAnderson, S.T. and S.E.
