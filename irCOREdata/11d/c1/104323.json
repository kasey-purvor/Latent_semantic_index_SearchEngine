INTRODUCTION \n \nRecent meta-analysis of data from trials of high levels of dietary supplementation \nwith vitamins, including vitamin E, surprisingly suggests an associated increased risk \nof cancer and overall morbidity [1-3]. Previously, little risk was attached to vitamin E \nsupplementation and there are indications that it is beneficial in preventing some \nmajor diseases such as atherosclerosis and cancer [4-7]. Vitamin E exists in several \nforms of which \u03b1-tocopherol is the best antioxidant, although a specific role for \u03b3-\ntocopherol has also been claimed [8,9]. It is now appreciated that in addition to their \nwidely acknowledged antioxidant activities as chain-breaking inhibitors of lipid \nperoxidation [10,11], tocopherols also have some important non-antioxidant activities \nin vivo [12,13]. There are therefore many aspects of the biochemistry of vitamin E \nwhich might be explored in relation to its potentially harmful effects. \n \nOxidation of \u03b1-tocopherol (\u03b1-TOH) is known to give a range of products. In vitro, \nexposure to peroxyl radicals generated from the azoinitiator 2,2\u2019-azobis(2,4-\ndimethylvaleronitrile) gave mainly the peroxyl adduct and a spirodimer with a smaller \nyield of \u03b1-tocopherolquinone (\u03b1-TQ) [14]. In microsomes the same radical source \nalso generated \u03b1 -TQ which to a variable extent was found to be converted back to the \n\u03b1 -tocopherolhydroquinone (\u03b1-TQH2) [15].  Moore and Ingold have reported on \nconversion of \u03b1-TQ back to \u03b1-TOH in man and reviewed some of the earlier findings \nrelated to formation and metabolism of \u03b1-TQ in animal models [16]. More recently \nYamauchi [17] has reviewed the formation of tocopherolquinones during lipid \nperoxidation in a range of systems. Unlike the non-arylating quinone of \u03b1-tocopherol, \nthe arylating \u03b3- and \u03b4-tocopherolquinones are mutagenic [18], cytotoxic [19] and \n 3\ncapable of stimulating apoptosis [20]. Maroz and Brede [21] have shown that \n\u03b2-hydroxyalkyl radical addition only occurs with unsubstituted quinones and that \nduroquinone (2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1,4-benzoquinone, DQ) is unreactive and not able to \nact as a radical trap. By analogy with substituted benzoquinones, radical scavenging \nthrough adduct formation might be possible in other tocopherolquinones (i.e \u03b3-TQ and \n\u03b4-TQ) but less so for the fully substituted \u03b1-TQ.  \u03b1-TQH2 is reported to be a good \nreductant, reacting more rapidly with peroxyl radicals than either \u03b1-TOH or reduced \nubiquinone and hence is proposed to be an effective antioxidant [22-24]. The \ndetoxification of \u03b1-TQ by DT-diaphorase (NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase) \ntherefore not only removes a reactive metabolite and prevents potential generation of \nreactive oxygen species (ROS) by redox cycling of the quinone, but also generates the \nantioxidant hydroquinone [25]. Other biochemical functions for \u03b1-TQ have also been \nsuggested including acting as a cofactor for fatty acid dehydrogenases [26] and as an \nanti-clotting factor [27].  \n \nThe reducing power of  \u03b1-TOH  (Eo\u2019(\u03b1-TO\u25cf, H+\/ \u03b1-TOH), 480 mV) endows it with \nantioxidant function, but similarly allows it to act as a prooxidant under particular \nconditions, especially in the presence of transition metal ions [28]. Such prooxidant \nactivities might help explain the potentially harmful effects of vitamin E. We have \nshown that on photolysis at 308 nm \u03b1-TOH and a model compound, 2,2,5,7,8- \npentamethyl-6-hydroxychroman (PMHC), generate singlet oxygen [29], a biologically \ndamaging ROS. However the overall quantum yield for formation of singlet oxygen \nwas rather small (ca 10%) and requires excitation of vitamin E within its absorption \nband in the UVB region. We have now explored the possibility that \u03b1-TQ may be \nmore effective than \u03b1-TOH in generating ROS. \n 4\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \nPulse radiolysis experiments were carried out using the 12 MeV linear accelerator at \nCCLRC Daresbury Laboratory [30].  Samples were irradiated in a 2.5 cm pathlength \ncapillary cell using doses of either ca. 3 Gy\/pulse (kinetics) or ca 7 Gy\/pulse (transient \nspectra). Spectra are shown as the product of extinction coefficient and radiation \nchemical yield (G-value) based on dosimetry with thiocyanate.  Time-resolved singlet \noxygen luminescence measurements were performed with a pulsed Nd:YAG laser \n(Continuum Surelight II-10, 355 nm, 5 ns pulses, ~ 1 mJ at the sample) and a fast \ngermanium photodiode (Edinburgh Instruments El-P) with a 1275 nm interference \nfilter (NDC Infrared Engineering, 25 nm bandpass). Laser flash photolysis used a \nsystem based on a YAG laser (355 nm, 10 ns pulses) as previously described [31]. \nData was analysed using the Origin 7.5 software package. \n \nSolutions were prepared either in Milli-Q grade water or in HPLC grade solvents and \nsaturated with the gases described before use. The pH was adjusted with phosphate \nbuffers and by the addition of perchloric acid when required. The three quinones \ninvestigated (see Scheme 1 for structures) were \u03b1-tocopherolquinone (\u03b1-TQ, 2-(3-\nhydroxy-3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-hexadecyl)-3,5,6-trimethyl-[1,4]-benzoquinone), the \nquinone from Trolox C (Trol-Q, 2-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanoic acid)-3,5,6-\ntrimethyl-[1,4]-benzoquinone), and the quinone from 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-6-\nhydroxychroman (PMHC-Q, 2-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)-3,5,6-trimethyl-[1,4]-\nbenzoquinone). Both Trolox C and vitamin E were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. \nPMHC was synthesised as described by Smith et al [32]. Conversion of the phenols to \nquinones was achieved by oxidation with FeCl3 in a single step [33], followed with \npurification by chromatography on a column of silica gel (Fluka, silica gel 60, 220-\n 5\n440 mesh). Identity and purify was established by thin layer chromatography and \nNMR.  \n \nSolutions were saturated with gases by bubbling. For varying the oxygen \nconcentration, nitrogen was mixed with either oxygen or air in a twin flowmeter \nassembly. The solubilities of oxygen in common solvents were taken from Battino et \nal [34]. The oxygen concentration in oxygen-saturated water\/ethanol (1:1 v\/v) was \ncalculated from the data of Cargill [35] to be 1.7 mmol dm-3. Methods for obtaining \nsinglet oxygen quantum yields followed those described by Nonell and Braslavsky \n[36], using phenalenone (perinaphthenone) as a standard with a quantum yield of 0.95 \n\u00b1 0.05 [37]. \n \n \n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n3.1 Pulse radiolysis studies of one-electron reduction of Trol-Q \nPulse radiolysis was used to study the one-electron reduction of the water-soluble \nvitamin E quinone analogue Trol-Q. From radiolysis [38] of deaerated aqueous \nsolutions (reaction (1)) containing 2-methylpropanol as a hydroxyl radical scavenger \n(reaction (2)), both hydrated electrons and hydrogen atoms are available at neutral and \nalkaline pH values as one-electron reductants with yields of 0.28 and 0.06 \u03bcmol dm-3 \nGy-1 respectively. In acidic solutions below about pH 4, hydrated electrons are \nconverted by reaction (3) to hydrogen atoms. \n  H2O \u00c6 \u25cfOH,   H\u25cf,   e-aq     \u2026(1) \n  \u25cfOH + (CH3)3COH \u00c6 H2O + \u25cfCH2(CH3)2COH  \u2026(2) \n 6\n  e-aq + H+ \u00c6 \n.\nH      \u2026(3) \n   \nIn addition, studies of one-electron reduction may also employ the isopropyl radical, \nformed with an overall yield of 0.72 \u03bcmol dm-3 Gy-1 in nitrous oxide saturated \nsolutions (reactions (4) and (5)). \n  N2O + e\n-\naq \u00c6 \u25cfOH + OH- + N2    ...(4) \n  \u25cfOH (\u25cfH) + (CH3)2CHOH \u00c6 (CH3)2\u25cfCOH +H2O (H2) ...(5) \n \nAt neutral pH the second order rate constant for reaction of hydrated electrons with \nTrol-Q was measured from the first order rate of decay of the absorption of e-aq at 700 \nnm (inset to Figure 1) giving a value of (2.0 \u00b1 0.1) x 1010 dm3 mol-1 s-1, at the \ndiffusion controlled limit. Figure 1 shows the transient absorption spectra measured \nfrom reduction of Trol-Q in pulse radiolysis experiments. The spectra obtained by \nreduction with hydrated electrons at pH 9.2 and with propan-2-ol radicals at pH 7.3 \nare essentially identical with a peak at 440 nm, except for the two-fold increase in \nintensity of the latter due to the respective G-values of the reducing radicals as \ndescribed above. The extinction coefficient at the peak absorbance (440 nm) of the \nspectrum at pH 9.2 is 6.7 x 103 dm3 mol-1 cm-1 based on a G-value for e-aq of 0.28 \n\u03bcmol dm-3 Gy-1. This is comparable with the value of 7.6 x 103 dm3 mol-1 cm-1 \nreported for the durosemiquinone radical anion [39]. At pH 1.8 a different spectrum \nfrom reaction of hydrogen atoms was observed with a peak at 420 nm and a lower \nextinction coefficient compared with that from reduction with hydrated electrons at \npH 7.4. By analogy with other semiquinone radicals [39], it is clear that the different \nspectra represent the anionic (Q\u25cf-) and neutral (QH\u25cf) semiquinone radicals at pH >7 \n 7\nand  pH 1.8 respectively. The intensity of the transient absorbance at 445 nm over a \nrange of pH values is shown in Figure 2 and gives a pKa value for QH\u25cf of  4.9 \u00b1 0.1. \nThis compares with a value of 5.0 determined previously for DQH\u25cf [39]. \n \nThe rate of reaction of Q\u2022- with dioxygen (reaction (6)) at neutral pH was measured \nfrom the increasing first order rate constant for disappearance of the absorption at 440 \nnm with increasing oxygen concentration as shown by the results in the inset to Figure \n2, giving a second order rate constant of (1.2 \u00b1 0.1) x 108 dm3 mol-1 s-1. This is \nslightly slower than the value for durosemiquinone radical anion (2 x 108 dm3 mol-1 \ns-1) determined by Patel and Willson [39]. Also in comparison with their results it is \nnoticeable that using the lower concentration of quinone (2x10-4 mol dm-3) the reverse \nreaction (6) was not significant and the reaction proceeded almost entirely in the \nforward direction, as expected from the value for K6 of 43 determined by Patel and \nWillson for duroquinone. Overall the results illustrate the potential for \ntocopherolquinones to redox cycle in vivo with the concomittent generation of \ndamaging superoxide radical as shown in Scheme 1. \n \nQ\u25cf-  + O2                   Q + O2\u25cf-     .............(6) \n \n \n3.2  Laser flash photolysis of tocopherolquinones \nLaser flash photolysis at 355 nm of PMHC-Q in deaerated (N2-saturated) methanol \nrevealed the transient absorption spectra shown in Figure 3. Immediately after the \nlaser pulse there is a broad absorption with a peak at 450-460 nm which decays with \nbi-exponential kinetics with first order rates (lifetimes) of   0.91 x 106 s-1 (1.1 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcs) \n 8\nand 8 x 104 s-1 (13 \u00b1 3 \u03bcs). Simultaneously new absorption bands were formed at in \nthe regions of 430 nm and 500 nm which decay with a lifetime of about 10 \nmicroseconds. Finally, a more stable product with a lifetime of some hundreds of \nmicroseconds is revealed between 400 and 430 nm. The initial species observed at \n450 nm is clearly the triplet state, based on its rapid quenching by oxygen (k2 (2.2 \u00b1 \n0.1) x 109 dm3 mol-1 s-1  in methanol, inset to Figure 5), and is formed by rapid \nintersystem crossing from the initial singlet excited state. The spectrum is very similar \nto that of the triplet formed from duroquinone (3DQ) [40, 41] although the lifetime is \nshorter than for 3DQ in methanol (\u03c4 ~ 5 \u03bcs, [41]).  The absorption band at 480-520 nm \nhas been assigned by Kemp and Porter [43] to the quinone methide anion formed \nfollowing rapid proton loss (Scheme 1) and is not observed to any significant extent \nfor 3DQ [41, 44].  The long-lived transient at 410-430 nm is ascribed to the \nsemiquinone radical as already described in the pulse radiolysis experiments. In the \nphotolysis experiment it is formed by electron abstraction and proton transfer from the \nsolvent [41]. In ethanol:water (1:1 v\/v buffered to pH 7) the decay of the triplet was \nslower (k = 5 x 105 s-1) and the reaction with oxygen was also somewhat slower (k2 \n1.33 \u00b1 0.05 x 109 dm3 mol-1 s-1, see inset to Figure 5). Although Kemp and Porter [43] \ndid not measure transient spectra, their results are consistent with those found here. \n \nIn hexane solution the spectra shown in Figure 4 were obtained and indicate that only \nthe triplet state is observed. The decay of the triplet is first order and more rapid (first \norder rate constant, k1  2.4 x 106 s-1 (lifetime 0.41 \u03bcs)) than in methanol. Again these \nobservations are supported by those of Kemp and Porter [43] in a hydrocarbon solvent \n(liquid paraffin).  This contrasts with the behaviour of 3DQ in hexane when a second \norder decay from triplet-triplet interactions is observed and the overall lifetime is \n 9\nlonger than in methanol under typical conditions of the experiment [41]. This suggests \nthat deactivation of the triplet state of PMHC-Q in hexane occurs through an \nintramolecularly hydrogen-bonded state involving the quinone carbonyls and the side-\nchain hydroxyl group, possibly through internal proton\/charge transfer. \n \n3.3 Singlet oxygen yields from photolysis of PMHC-Q \nSinglet oxygen was detected by time-resolved near infrared luminescence at 1270 nm \nusing a fast Ge photodiode detector. In oxygen-saturated solutions decays were first \norder and were extrapolated to back to the mid-point of the laser pulse in order to \nprovide the relative intensity of emission [36]. At low oxygen concentrations both \ngrowth and decay of the signal was observed and was fitted using a double \nexponential function. Relative singlet oxygen intensities (at zero time) from \nphotolysis of tocopherolquinones were plotted against the fraction of light absorbed \n(1-10-A) from a series of solutions of increasing absorbance (A) up to ~ 0.3  [36]. The \nquantum yields of singlet oxygen formation from vitamin E quinones were \ndetermined by comparison of the slopes of such plots with that obtained with \nperinaphthenone, for which the quantum yield for singlet oxygen formation of 0.95 in \noxygen saturated solutions is assumed for all solvents used [37]. Typical results are \nshown in Figure 5. \n \nThe singlet oxygen yields determined in this way are shown in Table 1.  \nMeasurements were made both in oxygen and air saturated solutions. The larger \nvalues in solutions saturated with oxygen compared with those saturated with air are \ndue to competition between triplet decay and energy transfer from triplet PMHC-Q to \n 10\nmolecular oxygen. Consequently the measured quantum yields (\u03a6\u0394) should follow the \nrelationship:- \n \n \n \nwhere \u221e\u0394\u03a6 is the quantum yield extrapolated to infinite oxygen concentration, kq is the \nsecond order rate constant for triplet quenching by oxygen and kT is the first order rate \nof decay of the triplet in deaerated solution. It is evident that the triplet yields are all \nrelatively high, being similar in the three polar solvents studied (methanol, ethanol \nand acetonitrile). The singlet oxygen yield appears slightly higher in cyclohexane \nwhere quinone methide formation from the triplet state is not a competing process as \nnoted above. Table 1 also shows that in ethanol the singlet oxygen yield from \u03b1-TQ is \nsimilar to that from PMHC-Q.  According to equation (7) a plot of 1\/ \u0394\u03a6  versus 1\/[O2] \nshould yield 1\/ \u221e\u0394\u03a6  as the intercept. Examples for PMHC-Q and perinaphthenone in \nmethanol are shown in Figure 6, from which \u221e\u0394\u03a6  is 0.89. Our laser flash photolysis \nexperiments show that the lifetime of the perinaphthenone triplet is about 20 \u03bcs in \nmethanol, allowing efficient energy transfer to oxygen even at comparatively low \noxygen concentrations. In contrast the shorter triplet lifetime (ca. 1 \u03bcs) of PMHC-Q \nallows triplet deactivation to compete more effectively with energy transfer and the \nresulting reduction in singlet oxygen yield from PMHC-Q at lower oxygen \nconcentrations is evident. The short lifetime of the tocopherolquinone triplet state may \ntherefore limit the amount of singlet oxygen formed under physiological oxygen \nconcentrations.  \n \n]7[\n][\n][\n2\n2 KK\nOkk\nOk\nqT\nq\n+=\u03a6\n\u03a6\n\u221e\n\u0394\n\u0394\n \n 11\n3.4 Reactivity of the triplet state of PMHC-Q \nScheerer and Gr\u00e4tzel [41] estimated the reduction potential of triplet duroquinone \n[E(3DQ\/DQ\u25cf-)] to be +2.17 V, showing it to be highly oxidising. We have previously \nshown that 3DQ is very rapidly reduced by antioxidants including ascorbate, \ntocopherol [45], lipoate [46]  and 4-hydroxycinnamates [47]. This suggests that triplet \ntocopherolquinones also likely to be highly oxidising and be capable of damaging \nbiological targets such as proteins unless efficiently scavenged by antioxidants. The \nsecond order rate constant for reaction of triplet PMHC-Q (3[PMHC-Q]) with \ntryptophan, reaction (8), was measured from a plot of the first order rate constant for \ntriplet absorption decay at 470 nm versus tryptophan concentration (insert to Fig 7) \nand found to be (1.30 \u00b1 0.05) x 109 dm3 mol-1 s-1, compared with an almost identical \nvalue of (1.38 \u00b1 0.05) x 109 dm3 mol-1 s-1 measured similarly for the reaction of 3DQ \nwith tryptophan. \n \n3[PMHC-Q] + TrpH \u00c6 [PMHC-Q] \u25cf- + Trp\u25cf + H+  \u2026..(8) \n \nFigure 7 shows the transient absorption spectrum formed after reaction of triplet \nPMHC-Q with tryptophan in an ethanol-water (1:1 v\/v) solution at pH 7. After the \nrapid decay of 3[PMHC-Q] the spectrum shows the formation of the semiquinone \nradical anion, [PMHC-Q] \u25cf- , \u03bbmax 440 nm and the neutral tryptophan radical, \u03bbmax \n520-530 nm [48]. This result clearly demonstrates the one-electron oxidation of \ntryptophan by 3[PMHC-Q] occurring with a second order rate constant approaching \nthe diffusion-controlled limit.  \n \n \n 12\n4. CONCLUSIONS \nOverall the free radical and triplet excited state properties of model \ntocopherolquinones such as Trol-Q and PMHC-Q reflects those of duroquinone. The \nmajor difference is in the behaviour of the triplet state where the triplet lifetime is \ngenerally significantly shorter than that of dururoquinone, especially in nonpolar \nsolvents such as hexane and liquid paraffin, and formation of the methide is observed \nin protic solvents such as methanol. The results obtained here demonstrate the \npotential for \u03b1-TQ to generate biologically-damaging reactive oxygen species as \nsummarised in Scheme 1. One-electron reduction of the water soluble analogue of \u03b1-\nTQ results in the formation of the semiquinone radical anion (\u03b1-TQ\u25cf- ) at \nphysiological pH. In vivo this is likely to involve enzymes such as cytochrome P450 \nreductase [49].  \u03b1-TQ\u25cf-  reacts rapidly with oxygen to form superoxide radical, the \nfavourable equilibrium constant of this reaction in the case of duroquinone having \nalready been demonstrated [39]. Superoxide may then disproportionate (catalysed by \nSOD) to give hydrogen peroxide and potentially the hydroxyl radical via a Fenton-\ntype reaction. These results appear to contradict the assertion [50] that under \nphysiological conditions superoxide may reduce \u03b1-TQ to \u03b1-TQ\u25cf- and thereby \ngenerate \u03b1-TQH2 by disproportionation of the semiquinone. \n \nThe excited triplet state of \u03b1-TQ also reacts with oygen to form the highly oxidising \nexcited singlet (1\u0394g) oxygen. At high oxygen concentration the overall yield singlet \noxygen approaches unity. However, the short lifetime of the triplet state and \ncompeting processes such as methide formation in solvents such as methanol may \nreduce the actual yield of singlet oxygen. Such limitation may apply to \n\u03b1-tocopherolquinone within the hydrophobic environment of a lipid bilayer, although \n 13\nthis may be offset by the higher oxygen concentrations expected in lipid bilayers due \nto the favourable partitioning of oxygen from the aqueous phase [51]. The reactive \noxygen species resulting from these processes (O2\u25cf-, \u25cfOH and 1O2) are all capable of \nproducing oxidative damage to biological targets such as nucleic acids, proteins and \nlipids [52]. We have also now shown that the triplet excited state of \u03b1-TQ has the \npotential to directly oxidise a biological target, in this case tryptophan. Such one-\nelectron oxidation of tryptophan residues in proteins is known to affect their activity \nand structure [53]  and it is postulated that certain tryptophan-rich integral membrane \nproteins may offer antioxidant protection [54]. \n \nThe quantum yields for singlet oxygen formation from \u03b1-TQ are considerably higher \nthan those recently observed from \u03b1-tocopherol (vitamin E) itself [29]. Excitation of \n\u03b1-tocopherol requires light of wavelengths < 310 nm in the UVB (290-320 nm) and \nUVC (< 290 nm) regions of the spectrum where the flux from sunlight is low. In \ncontrast \u03b1-TQ has a broad absorption in the region of 320-380 nm within the UVA \nspectral region where the amount of energy within the solar spectrum is higher. \u03b1-TQ \nis therefore more likely to be important as as potential sensitizer of singlet oxygen \nthan \u03b1-tocopherol.  \u03b1-TQ has been found as a photoproduct of vitamin E applied \ntopically to mouse skin [55] .  Excited states of carbonyls and quinones can be formed \nby chemoexcitation in dark reactions, some of them involving enzyme catalysis, \nassociated with electron or oxygen transfer [56,57]. The mechanisms described here \nfor oxidative damage arising from formation of triplet \u03b1-TQ are therefore potentially \nmore broadly significant than simply in terms of phototoxicity. \n \n 14\n5.
