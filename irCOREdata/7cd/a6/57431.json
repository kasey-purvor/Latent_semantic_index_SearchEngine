Researchers in California2 continue to develop their versatile \naerosol concentration enrichment system coupled to an electrostatic collector that was \nreported last year1. In order to collect ambient particles for chemical and toxicological \nstudies, modifications to the design involved separating the charging zone from the \nionisation zone to minimise the potential for possible chemical reactions between \nsampled particles and ions generated in the corona region of the electrostatic \nprecipitator (ESP). They were able to demonstrate high particle collection efficiency \nof greater than 90 % and, through developments of the ESP collection substrate, were \nable to demonstrate uniform particle deposition, a desirable feature for cellular \nexposure studies.  In the United Kingdom, researchers have developed a sampler for \nthe size-selective sampling of particles over a wide particle size range3. They used an \nelegant way of collecting particles over this wide range by employing a combination \nof a cascade impactor for larger particles, > 0.25 \u03bcm,  and a diffusion collector to \ncollect nanoparticles. A key development was the interface between these two units as \ntheir operating principles are different. A cascade impactor collects larger particles \nfirst and then particles of a smaller size in sequence, depending upon the number of \n 5\ncollection plates used. In contrast, a diffusion collector, here employing nylon nets \nwith different fibre diameters and fibre densities, collects smaller particles first. Hence \nif there were not spacing between the particle cutoff sizes, it would present difficulties \nin the reconstruction of the particle size distribution of airborne material once \nsampled. An interface was successfully achieved resulting in a sampler that had 11 \nstages, 5 of which involved the diffusion particle collector, covering the range 20 \u03bcm \ndown to 1 nm.  The sampler was tested by sampling in a lead crystal glass \nmanufacturing plant where, depending upon the work activity involved, the fraction of \nlead nanoparticles was found to vary between 10 and 70 % of the total lead that was \ncollected and quantified.  \n Monitoring workers\u2019 exposure to airborne particles in the workplace through \nthe use of personal samplers, i.e. samplers mounted on people, is an ongoing activity \nin many countries. The increased awareness that exposure to engineered nanoparticles \nshould be measured and the need to enhance the wearability of such samplers has led \nto a number of innovations in this field.  Liden and Surakka4 have developed a \nminiaturised personal sampler for measuring occupational exposure to airborne \nparticles in the breathing zone. Existing samplers tend to be large, so it is impractical \nto mount them on the face close to the mouth and nasal area. Hence they tend to be \nmounted on the torso and it has been shown that, owing to spatial variations in \nairborne particle concentrations around a working individual, sampling away from the \ndirect breathing zone may not be fully representative. This mini-sampler is to be worn \nmounted on a headset, modified from a professional microphone headset, which can, \nfor example, be mounted behind a welder\u2019s face shield. The authors suggest that, \nwhilst this design is most applicable for fume sampling, it may be used for personal \nsampling of the inhalable fraction of other workplace aerosols, provided that the \n 6\nmajority of the particles are below 20 \u03bcm.  In a similar vein, Hsiao et al.5 have \npublished work that they have carried out on the development of two mini-cyclones as \nsize selective inlets for a mini condensation particle counter for personal use. These \ndevices were designed to remove particles larger than 1.0 and 0.3 \u03bcm at a nominal \nflow rate of 0.3 l min-1. Their physical size is smaller than a US quarter coin! Work \ncarried out will also be applicable in designing inlets for other miniaturised filter \nbased samplers. A caveat about miniaturisation is that the physical quantities of dust \nthat can be sampled will be reduced, resulting in the need to apply sensitive analytical \ntechniques such as ICP-MS for, say, elemental analysis. The importance of \nminimising laboratory and field blank contamination will also need to be addressed.  \n Comparative performance testing of samplers is welcome, not only given the \nplethora of designs available, but also because preferences exist in different countries \nfor particular models. It is useful to compare the performance of personal samplers \nagainst their equivalent area or static sampler, as there is a growing interest in \nmonitoring an individual\u2019s exposure to particulates, particularly in the urban \nenvironment, where historically airborne particulate concentration data have been \nderived from static samplers. Mjestic and coworkers6 compared the size-resolved \ntrace metal concentrations derived from using three commercially PM2.5 personal \nsamplers with those obtained from a reference PM2.5 static sampler. Co-location \nstudies were carried out at two urban sites.  Data obtained, following analysis of \nfilters samples for a range of metals by ICP-MS, demonstrated that there were \nreproducible biases for the three designs relative to the reference static sampler. Park \net al.7 evaluated the performance of six different aerosol samplers by challenging \nthem with polydisperse fly ash spheres in a controlled test chamber. Likewise, \nReynolds and coworkers8 compared the performance of personal samplers for \n 7\ninhalable and respirable particulates using agriculturally derived  dusts in both field \nand wind tunnel settings.  \n The assessment of sampling artefacts, inefficiencies and losses is an ongoing \nfield of interest. Kumar et al.9 considered the losses of ultrafine aerosol (< 100 nm) in \nlong sampling lines and found that losses for particles < 20 nm were important and \nneeded to be considered if sampling lines longer than 1 m were required. Timko et \nal.10 reported evidence that carbon-impregnated conductive silicone tubing used in \nmany aerosol sampling systems can introduce two types of experimental artefacts, \nnamely the absorption of CO2 that requires a number of minutes to reach equilibrium \nand emission from the tubing of organic contaminants containing siloxanes that are \nadsorbed onto collected particles travelling through the sampler. Italian researchers \nlooked at both organic and inorganic sampling artefacts associated with sampling the \nambient PM2.5 mass fraction of suspended airborne particles11.  The focus was on the \npositive biases caused by co-sampled organic vapours obtained when attempting \norganic carbon measurements, and negative or positive biases in aerosol nitrate \nmeasurements due to evaporative losses of ammonium nitrate or adsorption of nitric \nacid on the filter.  In an attempt to address sampling issues with semi-volatile \naerosols, Kim and Raynor12 have taken a new approach by using a modified virtual \nimpactor design to collect and separate vapour and particulate phases. In a \nconventional virtual impactor, designed to preconcentrate particles, typically 90 % of \nthe air sampled moves towards the so called \u2018major flow\u2019 direction which is \nperpendicular to the air nozzle, while the remaining 10 % of air goes towards the \n\u2018minor flow\u2019 direction, which is parallel to the air nozzle, i.e. particles are \npreconcentrated into this minor flow.  In their modified design, this flow ratio is \nreversed, i.e. vapour is drawn off using 10 % of the airflow.  Whilst sampling on \n 8\nfilters predominates, Miljevic et al.13 have re-examined the efficiency of impingers \nwith fritted nozzle tips for collection of ultrafines and near ultrafine particles ( < 220 \nnm) and determined collection efficiencies higher than those reported with previous \nimpinger designs. It was noted that this collection efficiency is a combination of the \nfilter-like performance of the fritted nozzle tip, which has a porous glass frit, and the \nimpingement of particles in the liquid collection solution.  \n Deposition sampling continues to be used as a means of assessing atmospheric \nparticulate pollution. Austrian researchers14 assessed the extent of pollution from \npyrotechnics and fireworks by measuring the extent of contamination of pristine snow \nby barium nitrate. They found levels some 600-fold greater than those in \nuncontaminated snow. Researchers have compared the lead pollution records in a \nnumber of Sphagnum peat bogs in both the British Isles and the Czech Republic with \nknown lead emission rates15.  They suggest that regional differences in deposition \nrates of gasoline-derived Pb in the U.K. warrants further study. French researchers, \nbased in Grenoble, studied the dust deposit on the bark surfaces of trees16. Using \nSEM-EDAX and ICP-MS techniques they determined that a typical deposit was ~ 80 \n% organic in nature, ~ 10 % was of geological origin, which they termed the \natmospheric geogenic fraction, and ~ 10 % of an elemental anthropogenic origin, \nwhich they termed the anthropogenic atmospheric elements fraction (AAEF).  Using \nthe SEM-EDAX data of the deposit and that of the average local soil composition, \nthey suggest that it is possible to estimate the elemental content of AAEF directly \nattributable to anthropogenic activities. In this way, they found that most of the Cd, \nCu, Pb, Sb, Sn and Zn was in this AAEF fraction.   \n  \n 9\n1.2 Laboratory based measurements \n \n1.2.1 Sample preparation \nRisk of contamination during air sampling, handling of filters and their subsequent \nanalysis is a recurring theme. Upadhyay and coworkers17 have evaluated the trace \nmetal content of commonly used cellulose (CL), polypropylene (PP), polyurethane \n(PUF) and quartz fiber (QF) collection substrates (filters). Test samples were digested \nin a mixture of HNO3\/HCl\/H2O2\/HF in a closed vessel with microwave assistance and \nanalysed by ICP-MS. Results showed that the elemental concentrations of blanks \nwere in the order QF > PUF > PP > CL with a high variability for PUF and PP blanks \nfrom different sample lots relative to QF. Quartz filter substrates showed consistent \nblanks from lot to lot with a reproducibility of better than 10 % for the majority of \nelements. The results suggest that QF filters used in a high volume air sampler can be \na suitable filter for trace elements. Sampling for organic moieties is also possible, \nhence the potential for reducing sampling logistics. Italian researchers have optimised \nan ICP-MS based procedure for the determination of 20 elements in airborne \nparticulate matter and paid close attention to understanding and minimising \ncontributions from blanks18. \nFraction studies of airborne particles involving sequential extraction \nprocedures continue to attract interest. Berlinger et al.19 have undertaken a critical \nevaluation of sequential leaching procedures for the determination of Mn and Ni \nspecies in welding fume. The well-known Zatka sequential extraction, developed for \nNi species in refinery dusts, and a four-step sequential extraction procedure for Mn \nwere applied. Although these procedures worked well on simulated dust mixtures \nusing stoichiometrically pure metal salts, the authors concluded that such \noperationally defined leaching procedures have major limitations in the analysis of \n 10\n\u2018real-world\u2019 complex dust mixtures found in an industrial setting. They recommend \nthat complimentary analytical techniques such as XPS, XRD and TEM-EDX be used \nto decipher results from such extraction studies.   \nMaxwell and coworkers20 have developed a sample clean up procedure \ninvolving ion exchange resins to remove co-existing metallic species that can \npotentially cause spectral interferences in the determination of Be by ICP-AES in \nworkplace dusts. Further work on the measurement of beryllium is discussed below.    \n \n1.2.2 AAS, AFS and ICP based measurement techniques \n1.2.2.1 Elemental analysis \nAtomic spectrometric methods such as AAS and ICP are now well established for the \nmeasurement of elemental species in airborne particulate matter collected using \nfiltration sampling. Whilst AAS and ICP-AES continue to be used for the analysis of \nsamples derived from the atmosphere, particularly in developing nations, elsewhere, \nICP-MS is now starting to dominate this measurement arena. Presented here is a cross \nsection of published papers where the benefits of multi-elemental trace analysis by \nICP-MS are apparent. Lamaison et al.21 used a DRC equipped ICP-MS to determine \nkey elements, such as As, Cr, Ni and V, that can be subject to isobaric interferences. \nAmmonia was used as the reaction gas and NIST SRM 1648 urban particulate matter \nwas analysed to validate the procedure. Method detection limits were 450, 1210, 780 \nand 26 ng\/L for As, Cr, Ni and V respectively. Grotti et al.22 have developed a \nsensitive method for the determination of ultra trace elements deposited in snow \nsamples using QICP-MS. Following a preconcentration step involving evaporation, \nsamples were injected into the plasma via a PFA micronebuliser coupled to a total \nconsumption sample introduction system. Polyatomic interferences were removed by \nammonia gas in the DRC. Limits of detection were in the range 0.02 \u2013 0.45 pg g-1, \n 11\nallowing the determination of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, V and Zn in Antarctic \nsnow samples.  Moreno and coworkers23 identified atmospheric pollution events from \noil refineries through the specific use of La\/Ce and La\/Sm elemental ratios in digested \nair filter samples. Zeolitic catalytic convertors used in this industry can be highly \nenriched in REE. For example, a spent convertor sample recently submitted for \nanalysis in this author\u2019s laboratory was found to contain ~ 3 % (m\/m) La in the \npowdered sample.  Hu et al.24 present a comprehensive set of trace element emissions \nmeasured from state-of-the-art retrofits for heavy duty diesel vehicles and compared \nthese to a baseline of a vehicle without a retrofit.  The control technologies tested \nconsisted of combinations of diesel oxidation catalysts (DOC), diesel particulate \nfilters (DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) designed to reduce particulate \nmatter and NOX emissions from diesel engines. Test vehicles were exercised on a \nheavy-duty chassis dynamometer to replicate driving conditions. Tailpipe emissions \nwere sampled onto Teflon filters and subjected to a closed vessel, microwave-assisted \ndigestion procedure involving an aqua regia\/HF mixture. The water-soluble fraction \nwas also determined by leaching filters in distilled water for 6 hours. A suite of 49 \nmajor and trace elements were quantified using HR ICP-MS. It was found that a DPF \nsignificantly reduced the emissions of trace elements by some 85% as compared to \nbaseline. Total trace elements as a percentage of particulate matter from the retrofitted \nvehicles were comparable to the baseline vehicle, implying that the reduction in trace \nmetals was in concert with the reduction of particulate matter. It was noted that the \nzeolite-based SCR system showed a higher water soluble fraction of the emissions of \nmost metals than did the vanadium-based SCR system. There was considerable \nrelease of V and Ti, presumably from the SCR wash coating, and further work is \nplaned to elucidate the oxidation state of the emitted V species.      \n 12\nICP-MS as an elemental detector as part of a hyphenated analytical system \nalso continues to attract attention. Gligorovski et al.25 used a LA-ICP-MS approach in \nconjunction with an image analysis system to interrogate size-segregated atmospheric \nparticles collected with cascade impactors. The authors suggest that the whole \nimpaction spot requires mapping because artifacts generated by impactors can lead to \ndistorted impaction spots, i.e. the presence of halos or satellite spots. Researchers at \nthe University of Pau determined new volatile Se and Te species in fermentation gases \nproduced by composting duck manure26. Fermentation gases were sampled using \nTedlar\u2122 gas bags, preconcentrated in a cryogenic trap and analysed using a GC-ICP-\nMS system. Instrument calibration was performed using a mixer system that allowed \nthe simultaneous addition of nebulised liquid standards. The authors suggest that this \napproach, although semi-quantitative in nature with an estimated error of \u00b1 30%, was \nsufficient for this exercise. The absolute detection limits ranged between 0.006 pg for \nBi species and 4.0 pg for Se species. Corresponding relative detection limits range \nfrom 1.2 pg m-3 to 799 pg m-3 for a 5 l  compost gas sample.  Gilfedder and \ncoworkers27 determined iodine species in rain, snow and aqueous leaches of airborne \nparticulate, using an IC-ICP-MS system. They showed that soluble organically bound \niodine was the dominant fraction with minor components of iodide and iodate species.  \nSpecific elements continue to attract the interest of researchers. Human \nexposure to Be-containing aerosols can result in Be sensitisation, a cell-mediated \nimmune response. Hence the current 8-hour time-weighted occupational exposure \nlimit value in many countries, currently at 2 \u03bcg m-3, will in time reduce to 20 - 200 ng \nm-3. Consequently, attention is now being focused on measurement surveys to \nascertain whether workplaces, in particular non-nuclear industries that handle Be-\ncontaining materials, can meet these possible new limit values.  A French study, \n 13\nconducted between 2004 and 2006, collected both air filter samples and surface swab \nsamples from 95 work premises for subsequent analysis by ETAAS and ICP-AES28. It \nwas found that some 15 % of air measurements exceed the current 2 \u03bcg m-3 exposure \nlimit value. Work activities within foundries and in aluminium production were the \nmajor culprits. Exposure levels in other metalwork activities were lower but still some \n30 % of air measurements exceeded the revised ACGIH recommended 50 ng m-3 limit \nvalue. Surface swab samples were also analysed and it was noted that the average Be \nvalue exceeded the 3 \u03bcg per 100 cm-2 threshold value recommended by the US \nDepartment of Energy. Other researchers have examined surface levels of Be in a \nmilitary ammunition plant29 and Be levels in CAlSiFrit, a recycled product produced \nfrom spent pot lining used in the aluminium smelting industry30.  \nThere is ongoing interest in measuring mercury as a global pollutant. Pirrone \net al.31 set out future challenges in our understanding of atmospheric cycling of this \nelement. Analytically they suggest that knowing the precise chemical composition of \nreactive oxidised gas phase mercury species would be useful for understanding \natmospheric chemical interactions. Canadian researchers have carried out kinetic and \nproduct studies of the reaction of gaseous mercury with molecular iodine, atomic \niodine and iodine oxide radicals at tropospheric pressure within a reaction chamber32. \nReaction products were analysed in the gas phase and from deposits found on the \nwalls of the chamber. Analytical techniques used included CVAFS, chemical and \nelectron impact mass spectrometry, GC-MS, MALDI-TOF and HRTEM equipped \nwith an energy dispersive spectrometer. The major reaction products identified were \nHgI2, HgO and HgIO or HgOI. Glenz and coworkers33 investigated the \nappropriateness of packing materials in preventing the release of mercury vapour from \nbroken fluorescent lamps. They concluded that a double-boxed package incorporating \n 14\na laminated foil bag was required to prevent fugitive emissions. Most of the synthetic \ngypsum generated from wet flue gas desulphurisation (FSD) scrubbers is currently \nbeing used for plasterboard production. Oxidised mercury species can be trapped in \nsuch scrubbers when utilised on coal fired power stations. American researchers have \nundertaken a feasibility study of identifying mercury species within FSD gypsum and \nplasterboard products using a solid sampling thermal desorption method34. Another \nAmerican group has investigated the release potential of gaseous mercury from \naerated concrete that had been cured in controlled laboratory experiments35. The \nconcrete contained waste by-products such as coal fly ash or coal fly ash and \npowdered activated carbon. Mercury emitted from such experiments was sampled \nonto iodated carbon traps and subsequently analysed using CVAFS.  The mercury \nflux from exposed concrete surfaces to free air ranged from 0.77 to 11.1 ng m-2 hr-1 \nalthough it was calculated that less than 0.02 % of the total quantity of mercury within \nthe solid material was released. Coal fired power stations dominate in China and \nconsequently a number of studies of environmental mercury, involving laboratory \nbased AAS\/AFS techniques, have been published, including the determination of total \nand methyl mercury in wet deposition fluxes36 and mercury in size-fractionated \nparticles in urban air37. Studies involving real time in situ measurements from around \nthe globe are reviewed below.   \nInterest in the release of PGEs into the wider environment from automobiles \nequipped with catalytic convertors continues. Researchers based in Rome have \nundertaken a study to determine the exposure of the city\u2019s tram drivers by mounting a \nstatic sampler system on their vehicles38. Mean values determined in TSP\/PM10\/PM2.5 \nparticles were 82\/58\/15 pg m-3 for Pd, 20\/14\/9 pg m-3 for Pt and 4\/3\/2 pg m-3 for Rh. \nThe authors suggest that, whilst the levels are 8 \u2013 11 orders of magnitude below \n 15\nvalues thought to cause effects on workers handling such elements in an occupational \nsetting, they nevertheless suggest that periodic monitoring in the future would be \nsensible.  In 2004 and 2005 Chinese researchers recorded levels of platinum in \nShanghai air39. They found average levels in PM10 particles of 1.69 \u00b1 0.93 pg m-3 in \nthe centre of the city and an urban background value of 0.54 \u00b1 0.03 pg m-3. These \nlevels are lower than those recorded elsewhere in Western urban environments, \nsuggesting a lag time in the availability of catalytically equipped cars.  Spanish \nresearchers have developed an isotope dilution procedure to internally correct the HfO \nisobaric interference on Pt40. \nIn this review period, a number of papers on trends in elemental species in \nairborne particulate matter have been published. These include: a seasonal variability \nstudy between 1999 and 2003 of crustal and marine trace elements in the aerosol at \nthe Neaumayer research station in the Antarctica41; a 25-year record of atmospheric \ntrace metal concentrations from the Norwegian Birkenes research station42; a 5-year \nstudy from 2001 of trace metals collected in aerosol samples in Beijing43; a study \nconducted between 1994 and 2007 to determine the Pd content in road tunnel dust \nsamples44; and a long-term (1974 \u2013 2000) trend of Hg in Arctic air45.         \n \n1.2.2.2  Isotopic analysis \nInterest in using isotopic analysis for atmospheric tracer studies continues and \ninvolves the investigation of different elemental species. Lead isotopic analysis can be \na very efficient tool for tracing the sources of local and global pollution. A review(159 \nreferences) of lead isotopes in environmental sciences focussing on the use of ICP-\nMS has been published46. Deposition repositories, as an historical archive of global \nlead fallout, continue to attract attention, including the analysis of samples from \ncorals47, tree-bark pockets48 and sediment profiles from a salt marsh49. \n 16\nKetterer and Szechenyi50 present a review (182 references) on the \ndetermination of plutonium and uranium by ICP-MS, including the use of  SF-ICP-\nMS to monitor 240Pu \/ 239Pu ratios in fall-out particles from thermonuclear testing \nevents. The isotopic composition of single particles containing U and Pu, arising from \nnuclear safeguard activities, has been measured by both ICP-MS and TIMS51.  \nParticles were initially deposited on carbon planchets, for examination by SEM-EDX, \nand then transferred to a silicon wafer and subsequently dissolved in acid.  The results \nobtained by both techniques for CRMs showed good agreement with the certified \nvalues within the expected uncertainty. Chinese researchers have undertaken a study \non the analysis of the isotopic ratio of U-bearing particles in swipe samples by fission-\ntrack-TIMS (FT-TIMS)52. In summary, uranium-bearing particles in the samples were \nlocated using a FT procedure. Optical microscopy was used to aid the transfer of the \nparticle to a Re filament for TIMS analysis. Hungarian researchers describe the \napplication of a LA-SF-ICP-MS procedure for the isotopic analysis of individual \nUOX particles53. The methodology was deemed suitable for measuring 234U, 235U, \n236U and 238U in single actinide particles with lateral dimensions down to 10 \u03bcm. \nMeasurement precision was improved using a slow ablation rate and by obtaining \nseveral replicate spectra from the same particle. High mass resolution (R = 4000) was \nrequired in some cases to avoid spectral interferences. A multinational team has \nestimated the total global fallout of 236U on Earth as ~ 900kg54. The 236U fallout was \ndeduced from measurements of 236U, 239+240Pu and 137Cs in surface soils which are \ninfluenced solely by global fallout. Concentrations of 239+240Pu and 238U were \ndetermined by alpha spectrometry, while the 236U \/ 238U ratio was measured using \nAMS. Consistent 236U \/ 239Pu ratios of between 0.212 and 0.253 were determined, \nallowing this global fallout figure to be calculated.  \n 17\nIsotopic ratios of Fe55 and Zn56-58 in airborne particulate have been reported \nin aerosols collected downwind of metallurgical processes, leading to the suggestion \nthat these isotope systems could be used as a new means of tracing air pollutant \nsources.  \nSzidat59 has published a review(33 references) of recent developments in \nradiocarbon analysis of carbonaceous aerosols. Behrens and co-workers have \ndeveloped a GC combustion IRMS system for the high precision measurement of \ndelta 13C in atmospheric methane extracted from ice core samples60.  Swiss \nresearchers optimised an automated gas sampling and IRMS system for air analysis61. \nTuzson et al.62 describe a compact and cryogen-free, quantum cascade, laser-based \nabsorption spectrometer designed for in situ, continuous and high precision isotope \nratio measurements of atmospheric CO2.  \n \n1.2.3 X-ray based measurement techniques  \nLippmann63 suggests that semi-continuous atmospheric monitoring data, with at least \na 4-hour resolution, is required to understand more fully the impact on human health. \nInstrumentation that can provide this information has been available for a number of \nyears for gaseous species. Likewise, (near) real-time instrumentation, as reported in \nthis review over the last few years and further on is this particular review, for ionic \nand carbon species such as nitrates, sulphates and elemental\/organic carbon is now \nbecoming available. However, the determination of mass concentrations of trace \nelements in ambient air, with a time resolution of better than one day remains \nsomewhat elusive. It is therefore encouraging to see further developments in the \nrotating DRUM impactor sampler-SRXRF approach64. Size-segregated airborne \nparticles are collected onto a rotating polypropylene film, which is advanced on any \nhourly basis, to provide high temporal resolution. As the total aerosol mass collected \n 18\nin one hour is around 10 \u03bcg, experimental detection limits in the low ng range are thus \nrequired to measure the resultant trace metal content. This could be achieved only \nwith a SRXRF approach and it was found that more commonly available laboratory-\nbased XRF techniques were not sensitivity enough.   \n Synchroton radiation TXRF and XANES techniques are an exciting \ndevelopment for the characterisation and speciation of airborne particles.  Fittschen et \nal.65 characterised size-segregated aerosol samples collected in Hamburg with a \nBerner impactor and determined that 20 minutes of sampling time was sufficient to \ncollect sample material for the elemental determination of most metals.  Subsequent \nSR-XANES analysis showed that Fe(III) species predominated in all the particle size \nfractions. In a similar fashion, Groma and coworkers66, this time using a May cascade \nimpactor, determined ultra trace levels of metals at pg m-3 at the  Ferihegy airport in \nBudapest. They conclude that such is the sensitivity of this approach that it is possible \nto match the time scale of sampling to the time scale of the emission event under \ninvestigation.  Aeolian mineral dust archived in ice cores represents a time capsule for \nassessing historic environmental and climatic changes. Here the identification of the \ndust mineralogy can play a key role. A European research group has presented the \nfirst preliminary SR-XANES experiments on mineral dust extracted from Alpine and \nAntarctic ice cores[99\/100]. Results show that it was possible to examine the iron \ninclusion mineral fraction on insoluble dust in the 1 \u2013 10 \u03bcg mass range.  \n Japanese researchers have employed an in-air \u03bc-PIXE system to assess the \ncontent and spatial distribution of asbestos and other metals in lung tissues in vitro68. \nTraditionally it has been an onerous task examining lung tissue sections for evidence \nof asbestos, as samples have to be plasma ashed and mounted for electron \nmicroscopic analysis. The novel system could identify the location of asbestos bodies \n 19\nfrom the Fe, Mg and Si signatures. It was noted that the Fe and Si contents were \nhigher in lungs with asbestosis than in lungs without asbestosis. Researchers at the ion \nbeam facility at Surrey University in the UK concluded that PIXE analysis aided the \nconventional SEM-EDX analysis of gunshot residues (GSR).  Complementary \ninformation was obtained on trace elements that were undetectable by the SEM \ntechnique, thus strengthening the discrimination between different types of GSR69.  \nCharacterisation of individual airborne particles using x-ray techniques \ncontinues to be a fertile area for research.  Asian research groups70-71 have used x-ray \nmicroprobe techniques to characterise single particles collected during Asian dust \nstorm events. In particular, Ma and Kim70 compared filter packs, a low pressure \nAndersen impactor and a micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI) to \nascertain their performance as potential samplers for discrete particles. They found \nthat the MOUDI allowed more particle mass to be collected without overloading the \ncollection substrate, since it could rotate and present a large surface area for \ndeposition. However, this MOUDI sampler, like the other samplers investigated, \nproduced particle clusters and it was found that the microprobe analysis is restricted to \nindividual particles deposited at edges of spots. \n X-ray techniques are providing useful in the interrogation of nuclear derived \nparticles as part of safeguard programs. IAEA researchers are using SEM-EDX to \ninterrogate particles obtained via swabs for verification purposes72. Particle \nmanipulation and relocation procedures have been developed so that surface \nmorphological, elemental, isotopic and depth profiling information can be obtained \nusing a combination of analytical techniques including SIMS and focused ion beam \netching techniques. European researchers have undertaken solid state speciation and \nascertained the potential bioavailability of depleted uranium (DU) particles recovered \n 20\nfrom Kosovo and Kuwait73. A combination of synchrotron-based radiation techniques \nsuch as \u03bc-XRF, \u03bc-XRD and \u03bc-XANES were used and it is interesting to note that \nmost of the DU particles dissolved in dilute HCl after one week of immersion, thus \nindicating that a majority of such DU material could be considered bioaccessible.  \nX-ray powder diffraction is a suitable method for identifying and quantifying \nairborne particulate matter containing crystalline phases. Bye et al.74 have developed a \nprocedure for examining airborne respirable non-fibrous \uf061\uf02dsilicon carbide (SiC). \nInstrument calibration standards were prepared from respirable grade SiC powder \nsuspensions in an ethanol\/water mixture, which were filtered through polycarbonate \nfilters.  Absorption corrections were obtained with the polycarbonate filter placed \nabove a silver filter in the goniometer. A calibration range of 100 \u2013 1000 \u03bcg per filter \nwas produced and the calculated instrument detection limit was 12 \u03bcg per filter. In a \nsubsequent survey of Norwegian factories making SiC, airborne levels of between 12 \nand 890 \u03bcg m-3 were found, which can be benchmarked against a limit value \nsuggested by ACGIH of 3000 \u03bcg m-3. Stacey and co-workers75 have undertaken an \ninternational comparison to determine the cystallinity of calibrant dust materials used \nin the analysis of \uf061 quartz. Each of the collaborators was asked to prepare and analyse \nfilter standards in the range 1.5 \u2013 6 mg per filter prepared from various in-house \ncalibrant dust materials. Following absorption and drift correction, they were then \nasked to compare the value for the slope of the relationship between instrumental \nresponse and filter mass loading for each powder to that obtained using the standards \nprepared using the benchmark NIST SRM 1878a. In this way it was possible to cross \ncertify these various in-house materials for crystallinity.  Readers wishing to learn \nmore about developments in X-ray techniques should consult our companion Update \non X-ray fluorescence spectrometry76. \n 21\n \n1.2.4 Other measurement techniques \nCombustion techniques are often used to determine carbon species in airborne \nparticulate matter, typically operationally defined as organic and elemental carbon \nspecies.  However, carbonate-derived carbon can be an important fraction of \natmospheric particles, particularly where specific sources such as construction dust \nare present. Jankowski and co-workers have developed an operationally defined \nthermal program to quantify this carbonate-carbon fraction (CC) in air filter \nsamples77. In their proposed method, pre-treatment of the filter by heating to 460 \u00b0C \nfor 60 minutes is used to remove both OC and EC and thus the resultant total carbon \nmeasurement equates to the carbonate-carbon fraction. Measurements conducted on \nurban air filter samples compared favourably with carbonate-carbon values derived \nvia calculation from an ionic mass balance, i.e. cations and anions determined on \nthese filters by IC. The authors suggest that it is now possible to measure CC, OC and \nEC with a total carbon analyzer using a three-step procedure. Watson and co-workers \nassessed sampling artifacts arising from adsorption of semi-volatile organic vapours \nonto filters. These can be major causes of uncertainty in OC and EC measurements78. \nA US-Swiss consortium evaluated the OC extractability from three model particulate \nmatrices: wood smoke, diesel exhaust and urban particulate matter79. They compared \nfractionation by hot pressurized water and sequential organic solvent Soxhlet \nextraction and evaluated these extraction efficiencies using thermal optical \ntransmittance (TOT), reflectance and total organic carbon analysis. They found that \ncomparable OC yields were obtained with both extraction procedures accounting for \nsome 45 \u2013 60 % of OC as determined by TOT. These studies suggest that a significant \nportion of OC can remain unextractable.   \n \n 22\n1.3 Field and on-line measurements \n1.3.1 AES and AFS based measurement techniques  \nPark et al.80 have developed a LIBS system with a sheath air focusing system for the \nqualitative analysis of fine and ultrafine metal aerosols. However it was found that \nperformance was limited for particles below 100 nm in size due to the weak intensity \nof emitted light. Therefore the system was modified to preconcentrate particles by \nincluding an aerodynamic lens focusing system and a particle collection substrate. \nThey found that it was then possible to detect Cu particles,  ~ 60 nm in size, after \npreconcentration for 5 minutes onto this collection substrate. The system was then \nsubjected to a multi-metal test aerosol generated from an atomised ICP-MS grade \nmulti-element solution. They observed that the LIBS response increased with \nincreasing the collection time, i.e. response was proportional to the mass of each \nmetal collected. It was noted however that the sensitivity of LIBS response to \ndifferent masses varied from element to element due to changes in local plasma \nconditions such as plasma temperature, electron density and extent of ionization. \nMore extensive research on matrix effects are planned and such knowledge would be \nrequired to enable the development of quantitative analytical procedures.  \nAs reported last year1, real-time in situ measurements of mercury in the \natmosphere continue to be reported. Swedish researchers have reported data from a \nfield study around G\u00f6tenberg in 2005 using a Tekhran\u2122 mercury speciation \nanalyser81. Results show that the average concentrations for gaseous elemental \nmercury (GEM), reactive gaseous mercury (RGM), particulate bound mercury (Hgp) \nand total gaseous mercury (TGM) were 1.96 \u00b1 0.38 ng m-3, 2.53 \u00b1 4.09 pg m-3, 12.50 \n\u00b1 5.88 pg m-3 and 1.63 \u00b1 0.19 ng m-3 respectively. In a similar study conducted also in \n2005 using the same instrumentation, Korean researchers measured average \nconcentrations of 3.22 \u00b1 2.10 ng m-3, 27.2 \u00b1 10.3 pg m-3 and 23.9 \u00b1 19.6 pg m-3 for \n 23\nTGM, RGM and Hgp respectively82. A joint US-Japanese research group has \npublished data obtained during a sampling campaign in 2004 at the Cape Hedo \nObservatory on Okinawa Island downwind of Asian sources83. They recorded average \nconcentrations of 2.04 \u00b1 0.38 ng m-3, 4.5 \u00b1 5.4 pg m-3and 3.0 \u00b1 2.5 pg m-3 for GEM, \nRGM and Hgp respectively. American researchers at the Storm Peak Laboratory high \nin the Colorado Rocky Mountains recorded an average GEM value of  1.51 \u00b1 0.12 ng \nm-3 during a sampling campaign between October 2006 and May 200784. Another \nAmerican research group recorded an average TGM value of 1.4 \u00b1 0.2 ng m-3 from a \nsampling campaign in northern Wisconsin during 2002-200485. These geographically \ndispersed studies demonstrate the uniformity of background levels of mercury in the \natmosphere. \nThe Tekhran\u2122 AFS instrument used in the above studies is typically \ncalibrated at relatively high mass loadings, i.e. more than 100 times the instrumental \ndetection limit, using an onboard permeation calibration system. Swartzendruber et \nal.86 concluded that this instrument\u2019s default peak integration algorithm should be \nmodified if sub-optimal sample loading is undertaken, i.e. < 10-15 pg per analytical \ncycle. Alternatively, the full fluorescence peak can be recorded and processed off-line \nusing procedures that they claim can improve precision and thus reduce the detection \nlimit achievable.  \n \n1.3.2 X-ray based measurement techniques  \nField deployable XRF instruments combined with air samplers to provide near real \ntime in situ measurement capability are being commercially developed, but published \nwork has focused on the use and validation of hand held portable XRF systems. \nResearchers at NIOSH in the United States87, building upon work reviewed in \nprevious Updates, have assessed the potential of an radio-isotope source instrument to \n 24\nmeasure elements commonly encountered in workplace air that may be collected on \nair filters, namely Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn.   The evaluation included an \nassessment of LoD as a function of analysis time and as a function of filter type. The \nauthors also assessed the uniformity of instrumental response to selected elements \nacross the surface of the instrument\u2019s 10 x 20 mm probe window by measuring 2-mm \nsquare pieces of Cu, Fe, Ni and Pb at different locations under the x-ray beam. They \nconclude that, in light of previously published work and this beam uniformity study, \nconsideration needs to be given to the type of air sampler employed, as the dust \ndeposition pattern on the filter will vary from design to design. This author concurs \nwith this assessment and advocates the use and preparation of XRF calibrant filter \nstandards specific to the air sampler design in question. The potential to undertake \nfield-based XRF analysis of filters using the mini-sampler design reviewed in section \n1.1 is of particular interest.    \n   \n1.3.3 Mass spectrometry measurement techniques \nThe use of ATOFMS presents an opportunity to understand the sources of atmospheric \nmetals from point source emitters impacting receptor sites through the integration of \nmeteorological data and fast time-resolved single particle characterisation. British \nresearchers studied the size distribution and the elemental composition of airborne \nparticles in the vicinity of a large integrated steelworks88. Measurements with \nATOFMS showed six particle classes associated with differing processes within this \nsteel mill. Activities that contributed most particles included iron making, steel\/coke \nmaking and the rolling mills. A MOUDI sampler was co-located with the ATOFMS \nto provide time-integrated particle size analysis. Extraction, digestion and analysis of \nthe Teflon filter substrates by IC and ICP-MS techniques provided particle size \nanalysis on a species by species basis. In a similar vein, US researchers used \n 25\nATOFMS to estimate the contribution of point sources to an industrially impacted \nlocation89. They suggest that information derived from wind direction and particle \ncomposition can potentially be used to validate point source emissions inventories or \nto locate previously unidentified sources impacting such receptor sites. The authors \nevaluated the relationship between ATOFMS data and atmospheric concentrations by \ncomparing 24-hour integrated peak areas for metal ions of interest with 24-hour \nintegrated elemental concentrations obtained from XRF analysis of filter samples \nfrom co-located air samplers. For certain elements, a good correlation was found, but \nthis was less obvious for other elements where the authors noted isobaric interferences \nwith ATOFMS or where there are sensitivity issues with XRF analysis. The \ncomparisons support a semi-quantitative relationship between integrated ATOFMS \nsignal and ambient air concentrations.  The authors conclude that this measurement \napproach has some advantages over more conventional statistically based source \napportionment analyses, including eliminating the need for a priori knowledge \nconcerning point sources. However, it is acknowledged that the development of \nhigher resolution single particle mass spectrometers is required to reduce the impact \nof troublesome isobaric interferences.  \nDevelopment work to improve time of flight mass spectrometer capabilities is \nongoing. Wu and co-workers have characterised the volatile fraction of laboratory \ngenerated aerosol particles by coupling a thermodenuder to a mass spectrometer90.  \nHowever, they noted a need to be careful in the interpretation of volatility \nmeasurements because some molecular structures may change after being heated. \nKamphus et al.91 compared the performance of two different aerodynamic lenses \ncapable of focusing particles with diameters ranging from 80 \u2013 800 nm and 300 \u2013 \n3000 nm respectively. Matthew et al.92 studied sampling efficiency as a function of \n 26\nparticle phase type using laboratory generated aerosols. They noted higher sampling \nefficiencies for liquid particles and liquid coated particles compared to solid particles. \nThis they attributed to the fact that wet or coated particles tended to stick upon impact \nwith the vaporiser\/ioniser element within the mass spectrometer, while a significant \nfraction of solid particles bounced upon impact and were lost prior to the \nvaporisation\/ionisation and detection steps.  \nSwedish researchers have refined the design of their aerosol mass \nspectrometer design93. The instrument employs an aerodynamic inlet system for \nefficient sampling of particles into a vacum. Particles impact on a hot platinum \nsurface and are ionised. This Pt surface has a box-like design that limits problems \nassociated with particle bounce effects and incomplete ionisation. The main difference \nbetween this new instrument and the original design is that the quadrupole mass \nspectrometer previously used has now been replaced by a TOFMS. This change \nmakes it possible to obtain a complete spectrum for each detected particle instead of \njust one pre-selected ion mass when using the earlier quadrupole design. The \ninstrument is capable of detecting and recording complete alkali mass spectra for \nindividual nanometer-size aerosol particles in the range 50 \u2013 500 nm. The authors see \nthe potential for this instrument in aerosol research where some of the major types of \natmospheric particles such as sea salt particles, mineral dusts and particles emitted \nfrom biomass burning have an appreciable alkali content.  \nAmerican researchers have developed a new aircraft compatible single particle \nmass spectrometer - SPLAT II - that provides significantly improved performance \nover an earlier design94. An aerodynamic lens system is used to form a very narrow \nparticle beam, with low divergence, thus enabling the efficient transport of particles \ninto the instrument. Once the particles pass this inlet and two skimmers, they enter the \n 27\nhigh vacuum area where their presence is detected by light scattering. Two optical \ndetection stages using Nd:YAG lasers operating at 532 nm are employed. Spherical \nparticles in the size range 125 \u2013 600 nm can be detected with 100% efficiency. \nDetection efficiencies dropped for particles outside this range. For example, \nefficiencies dropped to ~ 20% at a nominal 1000 nm particle size and to  ~ 40% at a \nnominal 100 nm particle size, and to ~ 1.5% at a nominal 70 nm particle size. The \ndetection probability of asymmetrical particles was only ~3 times lower than spherical \nparticles of the same size. The time for particles to transverse these two optical \ndetection stages can be measured using timing gates and hence their velocity \ndetermined. Using this information, a particle vacuum aerodynamic diameter can be \ncalculated. This detection system is also used to trigger the two-step, twin laser \nprocess to generate ions. An IR laser is used to evaporate the particle and a selectable \ntime-delayed UV laser pulse is used to ionise the particles. The instrument is able to \ncharacterise the composition of particles containing both semivolatile and non-volatile \ncompounds and could typically size ~ 500 particles and record up to 100 individual \nparticle mass spectra per second.  \n1.3.4 Other measurement techniques \nThe in situ semi-continuous measurement of the ionic composition of particles using a \nparticle into liquid sampler coupled to ion chromatography, described in detail in \nprevious Updates, has now been employed by American researchers at several rural \nlocations in the United States95.  Comparison of such measurements conducted at 15 \nminute intervals with parallel traditional 24-hour integrated denuder\/filter pack \nmeasurements by laboratory-based IC analysis revealed generally good agreement \nbetween the two techniques. The slopes (field v laboratory analysis) of zero intercept \nbest fit lines for summed data from all the sampling locations were 0.97, 0.95 and \n1.02 for ammonium, nitrate and sulphate ions with r2 values of 0.92, 0.96 and 0.98 \n 28\nrespectively.  Linear regression slopes for individual sampling sites ranged from 0.80 \n\u2013 0.96 for ammonium ion measurements, 0.87 \u2013 0.95 for nitrate ion measurements and \n0.94 \u2013 1.08 for sulphate ion measurements. Measurements of ammonium ion in situ \nwere howver typically 4 \u2013 20 % lower than laboratory-derived results. This was \nattributed to difficulties in measuring ammonium ion concentrations approaching \ninstrumental detection limits that were found at many of the rural sites, as well as \nsuspected loss through ammonium volatilisation in the on-line system.  \nLaboratory-based thermal combustion techniques are commonly used to \nmeasure carbon species in airborne particulate matter. In recent years, semi-\ncontinuous field-based systems have been deployed in a number of countries. Bauer et \nal.96 undertook a comparative analysis of two Sunset OC\/EC analysers co-deployed in \nthe field and suggested modifications that could improve reproducibility between \ninstruments.  Grover and co-workers modified a Sunset analyser to include a dual-\noven mode so that semi-volatile OC, non-volatile OC and EC could be measured97. \nUnderstanding the role and mechanisms of halogen species in atmospheric \nchemical pathways, in particular their role in the depletion of the ozone layer, requires \nhighly time-resolved and sensitive field instruments.  Mahajan et al.98 describe the use \nof long path Differential Optical Absorption Spectrometry for the determination of \nBrO species at ppt levels at the marine boundary layer. Bale and co-workers have \ndeveloped an ultra-sensitive UV resonance fluorescence system to determine iodine \nspecies in the marine boundary layer99. It is anticipated that future Updates will see a \ngreater use of such sensitive, field-deployable instruments and the commercialisation \nand miniaturisation of such systems.  \n \n \n 29\n2  Water Analysis \nThis section highlights new developments and improved analytical methods that use \natomic spectroscopy for the determination of trace metal(loid)s and their associated \nelemental species in environmental water samples reported since the last Update1.  As \nwith previous Updates in this series, significant areas of activity currently focus on \nelemental speciation, vapour generation and preconcentration and extraction \nprocedures.  \n \n2.1  Sample preparation \n2.1.1 Sampling procedures  \nA passive sampler for obtaining time-weighted average concentration data for \norganotin species in water has been described100. The receiving phase was an \nEmporeTM C18 disk overlaid with a cellulose acetate diffusion membrane. The \norganotin compounds were eluted from the C18 disk with a 1 + 3 mixture of methanol \nand acetic acid using ultrasound, prior to ethylation and measurement by GC-ICP-MS \nor GC-FPD. Detection limits in water after the collection of 14-day samples ranged \nfrom 0.2 ng L-1 to 7.5 ng L-1. De Baar and co-workers101 have developed a new ultra \nclean sampler for seawater that can contain up to 24 GO FLO sample containers, \nmaking it 3 to 4 times faster to use than the standard GO FLO sampler system. Field \ntrials showed that results comparable with literature values for Fe in the Atlantic were \nobtained with this sampling system. \n2.1.2 Preconcentration, extraction and separation procedures \n Development of \u201cnovel\u201d preconcentration and separation techniques continues to be a \nfertile source of articles. The main trends seem to be the trial of every existing and \npotential chelating agent for use with cloud point extraction, or as a chemical modifier \n 30\nfor chemical and or biological adsorbents, as well as the miniaturisation of existing \ntechniques, such as single drop micro-extraction.  \nCloud point extraction (CPE) as a technique has recently been reviewed102 \n(178 references) for a period covering 2004 to 2008. The authors noted that it is an \ninteresting analytical tool, as it is as effective as traditional liquid-liquid extraction \ntechniques, but avoids the use of large amounts of toxic or flammable solvents. It has \na wide range of applicability including preconcentration prior to speciation and can be \nused with most inorganic analysis techniques. Many studies seem to be aimed at the \npreconcentration of a single analyte, but occasionally methods are published for \nmulti-elemental preconcentration103 from matrices such as high salinity waters104 prior \nto analysis using multi-elemental instruments. An interesting trend is the use of online \nCPE. For instance, a PTFE knotted coil reactor has been successfully used to retain \nthe surfactant-rich phase prior to elution with acidified methanol and analysis by \nETAAS105. Normally CPE is used for the preconcentration of cations, however it has \nbeen reported that mixed micelle CPE can be used for the preconcentration of anionic \nspecies106. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and Triton-X114 were successfully \nused to form extractable complexes of the anionic species of Au and Tl with \nmicrowave-assisted phase separation. Under the conditions reported, preconcentration \nfactors of 125 for Au and 110 for Tl and LODs of 0.12 pg mL-1 for Au and 0.02 pg \nmL-1 for Tl were found.  \nThe use of solid phase extraction for inorganic analysis has been reviewed107 \n(30 references, in Japanese with English abstract). Multi-walled carbon nanotubes \ncontinue to be investigated as a potential stationary phase for preconcentration. Gold \npresent in water has been shown to adsorb quantitatively on them in a pH range \nbetween 1and 6 and can be eluted with a solution of 3% thiourea in 1 mol L-1 HCl108. \n 31\nUnder the experimental conditions reported, a preconcentration factor of 75 was \nfound resulting in a method LOD of 0.15 pg L-1 with FAAS detection. The use of gold \ncoated silica for mercury preconcentration109 has been described. Gold nanoparticles \nimmobilised on a silica surface can trap various mercury species which are then \nthermally desorbed directly into an AFS cell for quantification. For a 7 mL sample a \ndetection limit of 180 pg L-1 was achieved with a precision of <3.2 % at the 5 ng L-1 \nconcentration level and a spike recovery of > 90%.  \nMiniaturized preconcentration methods have been reviewed110 (99 references). \nThis review reported on the adaptation of liquid-liquid extraction for use with small \nvolumes of extractant solution and covered three main miniaturized methodologies: \nsingle drop microextraction, hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction and dispersive \nliquid-liquid microextraction. Single drop microextraction seems to be particularly \nsuited to ETAAS and ETV-ICP-MS instrumentation and its use has been reported for \nthe preconcentration of Co, Hg and Pb from water samples111. Head space single drop \nmicroextraction has been successfully used to preconcentrate the hydrides of As, Bi, \nHg, Pb, Sb and Sn from aqueous solutions112. Hydride generation was carried out in a \nclosed vial and the hydrides trapped in an aqueous single drop containing PdII; \nenrichment factors of between 9 (for As) and 138 (for Bi) were obtained for a 210 s \ntrapping time with consequent LODs ranging from 0.2 \u00b5g L-1 for As to 0.01 \u00b5g L-1 for \nBi.  \n \n2.2  Speciation \nThe determination of arsenic species has been dominated by non-chromatographic \nmethods. Elci et al.113 determined the inorganic species of As in water after selective \nco-precipitation of AsIII with CeIV hydroxide followed by ETAAS determination, \nwhile a Japanese group114 used lead pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate as a co-precipitation \n 32\ncollector for AsIII followed by NAA determination of arsenic in hot spring and river \nwaters. In both cases, AsV was assumed to be the difference between the total arsenic \nand the AsIII concentration. The capacity of ADPC as a complexing agent for AsIII at \npH 3 \u2013 4 was used by three Chinese groups. One group115 retained the AsIII-ADPC \ncomplexes on a micro-column packed with carbon nanofibers prior to ICP-MS \ndetection. The second group116 used hollow fiber liquid phase micro-extraction \nfollowed by ETAAS detection to determine total and AsIII concentrations. The third \ngroup117 retained the AsIII-ADPC complex on an octadecyl immobilised silica mini-\ncolumn and AsV on an anion exchange resin mini-column with HG-AFS detection of \nAs after species elution. Campillo et al.118 have described the use of GC-AES for the \ndetermination of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and \ninorganic arsenic in sea water. The arsenic species were derivatized using methyl \nthioglycolate. This is a reducing agent so all the inorganic As is reduced to AsIII. The \nderivatized As species were extracted into cyclohexane and injected in splitless mode \nonto a low polarity HP-5 capillary column. The LODs varied from 0.05 ng mL-1 for \nDMA to 0.8 ng mL-1 for inorganic arsenic. \n The speciation of chromium in water continues to be of interest. The methods \npublished in this review period are dominated by the use of micro-columns packed \nwith chemical adsorbents119-121, biological adsorbents122-123 or natural fibres124. Chen \net al.125 investigated the use of carbon nano-fibres as a solid phase for a micro-column \ncoupled to ICP-MS. They found that CrIII was selectively adsorbed between pH 3.25 \nand 4.0 and could be eluted with 1.0 mol L-1 nitric acid. A preconcentration factor of \n100 was achieved resulting in LODs of 0.015 ng mL-1 for CrIII and 0.033 ng mL-1 for \nCrVI. Ma and Tanner126 determined CrIII and CrVI in water by isotope dilution using an \nICP-MS instrument fitted with a reaction cell. They co-precipitated CrIII with FeIII \n 33\nhydroxide and obtained the total Cr concentration by the subsequent addition to the \nsample of FeII hydroxide, which reduces the CrVI in situ to CrIII and the FeIII \nhydroxide formed in the redox reaction precipitates the CrIII thus formed. \nSpectroscopic interferences were best removed using ammonia as the reaction gas. \nThe inter-conversion from CrIII to CrVI species varied between 5.9 to 9.3% and the \nreverse conversion (CrVI to CrIII) was between 0.9 and 1.9%. The method LODs were \n0.4 \u00b5g L-1 for CrIII and 0.04 \u00b5g L-1 for CrVI. \n The determination of vanadium species in water127 has been achieved by \ncomplexing with EDTA the cationic and anionic tetravalent and pentavalent species, \nwhich were subsequently separated on a short anion exchange column in less than 6 \nmins using 4 mM carbonate buffer doped with 5 mM sodium EDTA as a mobile \nphase. Pre-column complexation prevented species inter-conversion on contact with \nair; recoveries ranged from 98-103% and the repeatability was 5.5% for VIV and 1.4% \nfor VV. The LODs were 0.16 mg L-1 for VIV and 0.025 mg L-1 for VV. Chloride \ninterferences were resolved chromatographically and VV was found to be the \ndominant species in mineral water bottled in PET. A Chinese group128 determined \nvanadium species in seawater by solid phase extraction at pH 4.5 on a Chelex 100 \nmicrocolumn followed by sequential elution of VV with 0.1 M ammonium hydroxide \nand elution of VIV with 0.2 N perchloric acid. Recovery was > 92% from synthetic \nseawater spiked with 40 nM of the V species, with detection limits of 0.5 nM for each \nspecies. Analysis of estuarine water from China showed that the dominant chemical \nform was VV with VIV levels changing seasonally. \n The analysis of tin and its species in natural waters continues to be of great \ninterest. Xiao et al.129 preconcentrated Sn species after derivatisation with sodium \ntetraethylborate using headspace single drop microextraction prior to GC-ICP-MS \n 34\ndetection of MBT, DBT and TBT in seawater; the LODs for each species were 1.4, \n1.8 and 0.8 ng L-1 respectively. Concentrations in Chinese seawater were found to be \n31 ng L-1 for MBT, 79 ng L-1 for DBT and 32 ng L-1 for TBT. Another Chinese \ngroup130 successfully determined MMT, DMT and TMT in seawater using coupled \nHPLC-HG-ICP-MS. Tin species were separated by reversed phase HPLC, and \npotassium borohydride and acetic acid were used to generate the hydrides. Detection \nlimits of 0.27, 0.09 and 0.04 ng L-1 were found for MMT, DMT and TMT \nrespectively; the precision at a concentration of 10 ng L-1 was < 1.4% for each species. \nSpecies recovery from seawater ranged between 95 and 107% and the MMT and \nDMT species were detected in unspiked seawater in the range 1.0-1.5 ng L-1 for MMT \nand 0.3-0.6 ng L-1 for DMT. Solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) has successfully \nbeen coupled to HPLC-ICP-MS for the determination of TBT, TPhT, TMT and TPrT \nin water samples131. The organometallic species were extracted onto a coated fibre \nand desorbed in static mode in the SPME-HPLC interface. The organotin compounds \nwere separated isocratically using a water-acetonitrile-acetic acid mobile phase. \nDetection limits were between 6 and 185 ng L-1 and the method was successfully \napplied to the determination of these species in freshwaters and seawater taken from \nleisure ports. \n Because of the high toxicity of mercury and its organometallic species, \npreconcentration techniques continue to be developed for their determination at \nnatural concentrations. A timely review (44 references) on the preconcentration \ntechniques currently used contains recommendations for the most appropriate in situ \nsampling methods132. Ito et al.133 have successfully combined in situ propylation of \nmercury species with stir bar sorptive extraction and thermal desorption GC-MS \ndetection. Detection limits of < 0.2 ng mL-1 were achieved for EtHg, MeHg, DEtHg \n 35\nand iHg with spike recoveries of 93-131%. The detection limits are not yet sufficient \nfor the analysis of natural waters, but the method appears to be promising. Methyl \nmercury, PhHg and iHg species have been determined at trace levels after \npreconcentration using CPE134. The target mercury species were transformed into \nhydrophobic chelates by reaction with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate and \nsubsequently extracted into a surfactant-rich phase of Triton X-114 at 40 \u00b0C. It was \nfound that EtHg partially decomposed during this process, but the other species \nappeared to be stable. After extraction, the species were separated on a reversed phase \nHPLC column with detection by ICP-MS. At a concentration of 0.5 ng mL-1 the \nprecision was found to vary between 2.3 and 5.3% depending on the species being \ndetected, with LODs in the range 6 \u2013 13 ng L-1. Methyl mercury concentrations have \nbeen successfully determined in lake water using species-specific isotope dilution \nwith purge and trap GC-ICP-MS135. An instrumental LOD of 0.06 pg L-1 was \nsufficient to determine MeHg in lake water where it is typically present at \nconcentrations of < 0.04 ng L-1. The use of isotope dilution allowed artifactual \ninorganic mercury methylation to be monitored during the analytical procedure; it was \nfound to be minor. \n Total, labile and inert fractions of silver have been determined in seawater136 \nusing batch adsorption on Chelex 100 resin. Total Ag was determined directly by \nICP-MS and the complexation mechanisms of Ag were investigated using the Gibbs-\nDonnan model. \n The free aluminium ion in ground water has been separated from its fluoride \ncomplexes using HPLC prior to FAAS detection137. The separation was achieved in \nless than 8 mins on an IonPac CS5A column using ammonium chloride buffered at \npH 3 as the mobile phase. \n 36\n The behaviour of Gd chelates during sewage treatment has been \ninvestigated138. Because they are widely used in magnetic resonance imaging and \nknown to have varying toxicities, they were determined in waste waters from \nhospitals. The Gd chelates were separated using a hydrophobic interaction \nchromatography column (HILIC) with subsequent ICP-MS detection. The \nmacrocyclic, non-ionic compounds were found to be the most abundant in the \nenvironment. \n A method for the determination of the redox species of molybdenum in \nseawater has been developed139 in which MoV is retained as its tartrate complex on \nXAD 7HP resin after pH adjustment of a 60 mL sample to pH 7. The water collected \nafter retention is treated with 0.5 mL of 10 % (v\/v) SnCl2 to reduce the MoVI present \nin solution to MoV, which is then complexed and selectively retained on the column. \nThe MoV complexes are quantitatively eluted with eight 5 mL elutions with a 1 N \nacidic acetone solution (1 + 9 nitric acid in acetone) which are combined, dried and \nre-dissolved in 5 mL of 0.1 N nitric acid. Detection is by ETAAS; the LOD for each \nspecies was ca. 0.2 nM and the analytical precision 10%.  \n Multi-elemental speciation methods are important because they allow us to \nobtain more information from a limited quantity of sample. After separating by HPLC \nthe redox species of Cr and Se with an anion exchange column, Bednar et al.140 \ncompared the performance of an ICP-MS instrument with a standard configuration to \nthat of an instrument with a reaction cell. At least for these species, there was no gain \nin using the instrument equipped with a cell. Both instruments achieved LODs of 1 \u00b5g \nL-1 per species and were capable of determining the redox species of Cr and Se in \nsurface water, ground water and municipal tap waters. Further speciation \ndevelopments can be found in our companion Update141.  \n 37\n2.3  Instrumental analysis \n2.3.1  Atomic emission spectroscopy \n Since the last Update1, the focus on atomic emission spectroscopy has been to \nimprove the detection limits by using either preconcentration methods or vapour \ngeneration methods, the latter will be dealt with in Section 2.3.2. Cloud point \nextraction has been successfully used to simultaneously preconcentrate Hf V, Th IV, \nUIV and ZrIV ions in aqueous samples142. Complexes were formed with \ndibenzoylmethane and Triton X-114 was used as the surfactant. The subsequent \nsurfactant-rich phase was diluted with a 1 + 4 (v\/v) mixture of methanol and 1 M \nHNO3 before ICP-AES determination of the analytes. Enrichment factors of between \n37 to 43 were obtained resulting in LODs between 0.1 and 1.0 \u00b5g L-1.  \nA Chinese group143 has separated the inorganic species of arsenic and \nselenium on an alkyl silica microcolumn modified with cetyltrimethylammonium \nbromide. The species were selectively retained by adjusting the pH of the samples to \npH 2.0 or 6.5 and eluting them with 1.0 M HNO3. Detection limits were 0.15 \u00b5g L-1 \nfor AsV and 0.1 \u00b5g L-1 for SeVI.  \n2.3.2 Vapour generation methods \n Vapour generation continues to be important for improving the sensitivity of atomic \nspectrometric methods for the hydride forming elements. A new type of hydride \natomizer for use with AFS, the flame in-gas shield miniature hydride atomizer, has \nbeen developed144. It compared favourably with the standard miniature diffusion \nflame hydride atomizer, resulting in sensitivity improvements of up to 5.5 times.  \nHydride trapping prior to atomisation continues to be investigated. An \niridium-coated tungsten coil was used to trap antimony hydride145, a gold-coated \ntungsten coil was successfully applied to selenium hydride trapping146 and an iridium-\ncoated graphite tube was used to trap cadmium vapour prior to AAS determination147.  \n 38\nTrivalent antimony and total Sb have been determined by head space single \ndrop microextraction with in situ hydride generation followed by ETAAS \ndetection148. Antimony hydride is generated by the addition of NaBH4 to the sample \nin a head space vial and the hydride is trapped onto a 3 \u00b5L drop of 30 mg L-1 \nPd(NO3)2 formed at the tip of a microsyringe in the headspace above the sample. After \na 180 s preconcentration trapping time, the drop is withdrawn into the syringe, \nremoved from the sample vial and injected into the graphite furnace of an ETAAS \ninstrument where the Pd also acts as a modifier. Total Sb is determined by reduction \nof all the Sb present to SbIII before addition of the NaBH4. In this way a \npreconcentration factor was 176 was achieved, resulting in a LOD for SbIII of 25 pg \nml-1.  \nAn online method for the redox speciation of Sb has also been developed with \nICP-AES detection149. The SbIII is selectively retained on a micro-column containing \nL-proline immobilised on to controlled pore glass. The SbV is detected after online \nreduction by HG-ICP-OES during the loading phase, SbIII is then eluted using 2 M \nHCl and detected without further reduction. For an 8 mL sample a preconcentration \nfactor of 11 was achieved with a LOD of 90 ng L-1 for SbIII and 900 ng L-1 for SbV; \nthe sum of SbIII and SbV was in good agreement with the certified  value of Sb for the \nCRM used and results by ICP-MS analysis of effluent waters.  \nSensitivity for the detection of ammonium and organically bound nitrogen by \nICP-AES in natural and waste waters has been improved by the development of a \nvapour generation method150. Ammonia vapour is generated by the addition of \nconcentrated NaOH followed by detection at 174.273 nm using an axial ICP-AES \ninstrument. Detection limits of 10 \u2013 25 mg L-1 as N were achieved with an analytical \nprecision of between 0.6 and 4.6 % RSD for a concentration range of 25 \u2013 1000 mg L-\n 39\n1. The advantages of this method are that it is faster than the standard Kjeldahl method \nand more sensitive than solution nebulisation ICP-AES for the same analysis. \n2.3.3 X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy \n Solid phase extraction procedures in conjunction with TXRF have been developed for \nthe determination of metals in seawater. Staniszewski and Freimann151 adjusted the \npH of a 120 g sample of seawater to 2.2, added 10 ml of a 5 % m\/v L-cysteine solution  \nand heated it to 85 \u00b0C for 60 mins to reduce all the arsenic to AsIII. The sample was \ncooled, the pH adjusted to about 5 and the analytes complexed by the addition of a \nsodium dibenzyldithiocarbamate (NaDBC) solution. The complexes were loaded onto \nsilica gel columns, eluted using a chloroform-methanol mixture and a 50 \u00b5L aliquot \nwas pipetted onto a quartz sample carrier and evaporated to dryness for analysis by \nTXRF. Detection limits were about 10 ng L-1 for As and sufficient for the routine \ndetection of Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, U and Zn in North Sea water. The disadvantage of this \nmethod is that the addition of L-cysteine reduces Mn and Se to forms that do not \ncomplex with NaDBC, so they are undetectable with this methodology. Membrane \nextraction has been used isolate Co, Cu, Ni and Zn from water and seawater prior to \nmeasurement by TXRF152. The elements were selectively extracted as anionic \ncomplexes of 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol onto a PVC membrane deposited onto the \ncentre of a quartz reflector modified with tricaprylyl methyl ammonium chloride \n(Aliquat-336). Detection limits of between 0.7 and 1.3 ng mL-1 for the metals studied \nwere achieved. \n2.3.4 Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry \n Sector field ICP-MS continues to be the method of choice for the determination of \ntrace elements in the cryosphere and pristine environments. Silver and Tl have been \ndetermined in Arctic snow, firn and ice153 and heavy metals and metalloids have been \ndetermined in ice collected from Antarctica154. Both studies required the development \n 40\nand use of specialised clean room protocols that could be applied to other fields \ninvolving ultratrace analysis.  \nHowever, collision cell and reaction cell instruments are challenging this \npredominance. Grotti and co-workers22 have demonstrated that a quadrupole \ninstrument equipped with a reaction cell and fitted with a total consumption \nmicrosample introduction system can achieve detection limits low enough to \ndetermine Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, V and Zn in Antarctic snow. Samples were \npreconcentrated by freeze drying a 10 mL aliquot and re-dissolving the residue in 200 \n\u00b5L of 0.05 % v\/v nitric acid. The high plasma solvent load (20 mg min-1), caused by \nthe use of an electrically heated evaporation chamber, is partially compensated for by \ntuning for low oxides levels; ammonia was used as a reaction gas to reduce isobaric \ninterferences.  \nPreconcentration techniques previously used in conjunction with AAS \ncontinue to be investigated for use with ICP-MS. Lanthanum co-precipitation has \nbeen used to successfully separate the oxo-anions of As, Sb, V and W from \nseawater155. The two-step method consists of a precipitation stage and a separation \nstage. In the first stage, 20 mL of sample are adjusted to pH 9.5 with ammonium \nhydroxide, to which 0.2 mL of a 5 g L-1 solution of La(NO3)3.6H2O are added. The \nprecipitate formed is collected on a 0.2 \u00b5m membrane filter and re-dissolved in 2 mL \nof 2 M HNO3. In the second stage, this solution is diluted two-fold and passed \nthrough an AG 50W-X8 cation exchange resin column to remove the lanthanum. \nExtraction recoveries range from 80 to 96% with a preconcentration factor of 5, \nresulting in analytical LODs ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 ng L-1. The same group applied \nthis method in tandem with preconcentration on a Chelex\u00ae 100 column to quantify 56 \nelements in the waters of Lake Baikal156 using a sector field ICP-MS. Single-walled \n 41\ncarbon nanotubes have been evaluated as a potential solid phase extraction medium \nfor rare earth elements157. It was found that REEs are retained quantitatively in a pH \nrange from 3.0 to 8.0 and can be eluted completely with 1 M HNO3. Enrichment \nfactors of up to 75-fold were achievable with recoveries of about 90% resulting in \nLODs of between 0.25 and 0.57 pg mL-1, with a precision of better than 5% RSD (n= \n9) at the 1.0 ng mL-1 concentration level.  \nAn Fe-specific resin with multi-collector ICP-MS has been used to determine \nthe isotopic composition of dissolved Fe at its open ocean concentration range (0.1-1 \nnM)158. Dissolved Fe is preconcentrated using a Nitriloacetic Acid (NTA) superflow\u00ae \nresin (Qiagen) followed by purification using an AG1x4 anion exchange resin. A \nmeasurement precision of 0.13 \u2030 RSD was achieved with a desolvating nebuliser \n(Aridus II). The concentrations of Fe in seawater have been measured by isotope \ndilution multi-collector ICP-MS159. A preconcentration step utilizing the NTA \nsuperflow\u00ae resin was necessary. It was reported that this resin quantitatively extracts \nFe at a pH as low as 1.7, even in oxidised seawater (after addition of H2O2), \neliminating the need for buffering of the sample. To reach a preconcentration of 100 \ntimes from a 50 mL sample, the eluate from the column is evaporated and re-\ndissolved in 0.05 M HNO3. Using this method the blanks were kept below 0.06 nmol \nL-1 and the LOD per session varied between 0.020 and 0.069 nmol L-1. \n2.3.5 Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy \n The use of LIBS as a sensor for bulk water analysis is being investigated by a \nnumber of workers. It has been shown to be capable of detecting toxic metal \ncontaminants in waste waters from a dairy production plant160 after ablation of the \nwater surface in a flow cell. To expand the applicability of this technique, LIBS has \nbeen carried out in the laboratory at simulated oceanic pressures of up to 2.76 x 107 \nPa161 and the pulse energy and gate delay optimised. It was found that water pressure \n 42\nhad little effect on the peak intensity, that short gate delays of < 200 ns had to be used \nat all pressures and that low laser energy pulses of < 60 mJ could be used. It is hoped \nthat this technique could be used to monitor in situ the bulk composition of \nhydrothermal vent fluids. \n \n2.4  Data quality and method standardisation \n An interlaboratory comparison of the ultratrace determination of REEs has been \npublished162. Sector field, time of flight and quadrupole based ICP-MS systems were \ncompared for the determination of REEs in ice core samples after digestion and sub-\nboiling preconcentration. It was found that sector field ICP-MS is still the instrument \nof choice for this specialized application. Measurements from quadrupole based \ninstruments agreed well with those from sector field instruments but had higher RSDs, \nand the results from the time of flight instrument suffered from a small positive bias. \nThe results of a proficiency testing exercise involving 47 Spanish laboratories for the \nuse of ICP-MS for the determination of 16 elements in natural waters have been \npublished163; assigned values for 12 of the elements were provided by isotope dilution \nanalysis. The analytical results were evaluated by different scoring procedures \naccording to European Directive 98\/83\/EC. The procedures used for outlier \nelimination (Cochran and Grubbs test, Hampel test and a combination of the Cochran \nand Hampel tests) were critically compared. \nLytle and co-workers164 compared an in-house microwave digestion procedure \nfollowed by ICP-MS measurement using US EPA method 200.8 with the AFS-based \nUS EPA methods 245.7 and 1631E for the analysis of total mercury in waste water \nand industrial effluents. They showed that heating the samples in closed vessels at 50 \n\u00b0C for 6 hours, as suggested in methods 245.7 and 1631, should be done to obtain \nreliable values for total mercury. Room temperature digestion with BrCl as described \n 43\nin method 1631E or with KBrO3\/KBr as in method 245.7 for waters is ill suited to \nindustrial effluent and waste water samples as it gives a negative bias. It is suspected \nthat only the easily oxidisable fraction is measured when room temperature digestion \nfollowed by AFS detection of mercury is used. \nA robust method for the determination of the strontium isotopic signature of \nmineral water has been validated165. Commercially available pre-packed columns \nfilled with a Sr-specific resin were used to remove isobaric interferences. Mass bias \ncorrection was carried out internally using the 88Sr to 86Sr ratio and the method was \nfound fit for purpose for comparing mineral waters from different geological \nbackgrounds.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 44\n3 Analysis of soils, plants and related materials \n \nNumerous articles have been published since the previous Update1 featuring the \napplication of atomic spectrometry to the analysis of soils and plants.  \n \n3.1 Sample preparation \n3.1.1 Sample dissolution and extraction \nVarious comparisons of sample digestion procedures have been aimed at optimising \nprocedures for isolating analytes from specific sample matrices. Vaisanen et al.166 \napplied microwave digestion, ultrasound-assisted digestion and dry ashing in the \nanalysis of a pine needle reference material NIST SRM 1474a by ICP-AES. The best \naccuracy was obtained with dry ashing followed by ultrasound-assisted dissolution of \nthe ash in 50% aqua regia. The speed of the ultrasound step \u2013 3 minutes \u2013 partially \noffset the relatively long ashing time of 5 h. Dry ashing at 550 \u00b0C was also \nrecommended in the analysis of rice and wheat samples by Srivastava et al.167. \nMixtures of nitric acid with hydrogen peroxide or perchloric acid were found suitable \nfor the digestion of swine manure prior to the determination of 13 elements by ICP-\nAES168 but sulfuric acid with hydrogen peroxide gave inconsistent results. Japanese \nworkers169 reported low recoveries for several analytes (Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn), \nwhich they attributed to a combination of volatilisation losses and alloying reactions \nwith platinum crucibles, when alkali fusion was used in the analysis of sewage sludge \nreference material BCR 144R. Even with their preferred method of microwave \ndigestion, HF was required to obtain quantitative recoveries for Nb, Ta and Hf. In \ncontrast, Mariet et al.170 substituted successfully NH4F for HF\/HClO4 in the digestion \nof lichen, soil and rock CRMs prior to multi-element determination by ICP-MS. Four \n 45\ncombinations171 of HCl, HNO3, H2O2 and HF have been evaluated for the microwave-\nassisted digestion of highly calcareous soils prior to analysis by ICP-AES, using BCR \n141R as a test substrate. Extremely poor recoveries, < 5% of certified values, were \nobtained for Al when HF was used, and H2O2 appeared to have negligible influence \non extraction efficiencies. Hence, aqua regia was recommended.  \n Element-specific sample digestion procedures have been reported for several \nanalyses. Sintering with Na2CO3 and ZnO at 560 \u00b0C gave recoveries of \u2265 96% in the \ndetermination of Br and Cl by SF-ICP-MS in a variety of waste materials172 including \nsewage sludge reference materials BCR 144R and 146R. Bolou-Bi173 described an \nimproved method for extraction of Mg for measurement of \uf06426Mg in alkali-rich CRMs \nsuch as soils and plants by MC-ICP-MS. Grinberg and Sturgeon174 used several \nreference materials, including NIST SRM 1572 Citrus leaves and NIST SRM 2709 \nSan Joaquin soil, to evaluate a new method for the extraction of I. The procedure \ninvolves thermal decomposition of samples, followed by capture of I2 in 5% (v\/v) \nacetic acid. This solution is then irradiated with UV light, generating free radicals that \nundergo photochemical reactions to produce volatile I species suitable for \nmeasurement by ICP-MS. \n Spike recovery experiments with samples of maize and oak leaves suggested \nthat treatment of 1 g of dried plant material with 10 mL of aqua regia for 16 h at room \ntemperature, followed by reflux for 2.5 h, was suitable for the determination of Pd, Pt \nand Rh in plants by USN-ICP-MS175. Pre-treatment with HNO3 followed by \nmicrowave-assisted digestion in HF and then treatment of the cooled digest with boric \nacid was preferred for the determination of the same analytes in road dust by \nETAAS176, aqua regia being unsuitable because of interferences from chloride in \nfurnace atomisers.    \n 46\nA six-stage extraction has been developed to explore the speciation of Se in \nfreeze-dried garlic177. The stages are water extraction, enzymatic cell wall lysis, \nproteolysis, HCl extraction, sulfite extraction and CS2 extraction, indicating \nconcentrations of water soluble Se, cell-wall bound Se, protein bound Se, inorganic Se \nbound to organic matter, elemental Se, and selenide, respectively. Extraction methods \nfor Se speciation in vegetables were summarised in a review by Pyrzynska (75 \nreferences)178.  \n The environmental chemistry of Sb has been reviewed179 and the need for \nimproved analytical methods for Sb highlighted. Hjortenkrans et al.180 have described \nthe optimisation of methods for the recovery of Sb from urban samples, including \nsoils. \n Lomonte et al.181 reported an optimised procedure for the isolation of Hg from \nbiosolids using mineral acids, H2O2 and hotplate digestion. Two detailed reviews on \nthe extraction and determination of Hg species focus on the use of SPME182 (55 \nreferences) and on methods for extraction of analytes from soils and sediment \nsamples183 (170 references).  \n Arsenic speciation remains an active topic of investigation and research has \ncontinued to develop species-conserving methods for extracting As from plants. \nSchmidt et al.184 used a two-stage sequential extraction \u2013 deionised water followed by \n1 g L-1 cellulase in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7 \u2013 to isolate AsIII, AsV, MMA and \nDMA from Tropaeolum majus (Indian Cress). A Polish research group185 measured \nthe same analytes in specimens of Calamagrostis arundinacea (Reed Grass) and \nAthyrium filix-femina (Lady Fern) growing in the vicinity of a disused gold and \narsenic mine. The compounds were isolated from dried, milled, sieved plant material \nby sonication in distilled water followed by shaking with 4% sodium dodecylsulfate \n 47\nsurfactant. Other workers186 suggested that two separate extractions should be \nperformed, one in water and one in a 9+1 methanol-water mixture, to obtain a \ncomplete profile of As species in the submerged freshwater plant Ceratophyllum \ndemersum (Coontail). \n Development of ultrasound-assisted digestion methods continues to be of \ninterest. Kazi et al.187 studied sonication time, temperature of the ultrasonic bath and \nacid composition to optimise procedures that could be performed in ca. 30 minutes \nand gave extraction efficiencies equivalent to conventional acid digestion. Recoveries \nfor Cd, Cr, Ni and Pb determined by ETAAS in a range of environmental and \nbiological RMs were 96 to 102%. Other workers188 reported that < 10 min treatment \nof dust samples with an ultrasonic probe, using either 0.05 mol L-1 EDTA or 2 mol L-1 \nHCl extractants, yielded recoveries of Cu, Pb and Zn similar to those achieved by \nconventional extraction. \n Research to develop more rapid versions of the BCR sequential extraction \nprocedure has continued, although there are reservations over whether this goal can \nbe justified given the operationally-defined nature of the protocol and the fact that it \nwas originally developed as a harmonised procedure to allow comparable results to be \nobtained by different laboratories, and so must be performed exactly as prescribed. \nWorkers in Pakistan have proposed two modifications: that researchers working in \nwarm climates may reduce the shaking time at each step from 16 h (overnight) to 8-10 \nh since higher ambient laboratory temperatures lead to more rapid extraction189 and \nthat the procedure may be performed with microwave assistance in less than 10 \nmins190. The microwave procedure was developed using CRM BCR 483 (Sewage \nsludge amended soil) but was not applied to CRMs certified for analytes extractable \nby the BCR procedure, e.g. BCR 701 Lake sediment, to check whether equivalent \n 48\nperformance would be obtained for substrates other than that used in method \ndevelopment.  \n A potentially significant advance in this area is the replacement of current, \nstatic methods with dynamic sequential extraction procedures that more accurately \nsimulate environmental processes, e.g. the percolation of rainwater through soil. Both \nsequential injection micro-column extraction and sequential injection stirred-flow \nchamber extraction191 have been explored using the same reagents as the conventional \nBCR protocol, ICP-AES and a coal fly ash CRM. These procedures are readily \nautomated, can be performed in < 4 h, appear not to be operationally-defined and \nshow considerable promise for further development.  \n \n3.1.2 Preconcentration procedures \nA large number of publications have described methods for the isolation or \npreconcentration of metals from aqueous samples, including soil and plant digests. \nSome procedures involving cloud point extraction are summarised in Table 1, \nprocedures involving co-precipitation in Table 2, and procedures involving sorbent \nsystems in Table 3. Most are intended specifically for analysis of soils, plants and \nrelated materials, but methods for water or food analysis are included if plant or soil \nCRMs were used in their validation. \n \n3.2 Instrumental analysis \n3.2.1 Atomic absorption spectrometry \nAn important development is the advent of commercial instrumentation for high \nresolution continuum source flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Brazilian \nworkers192 have used this equipment to develop a method for sequential measurement \n 49\nof Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn in 0.005 mol L-1 DTPA extracts of agricultural and reference \nsoils. Options for increasing the linear range for determination of Fe, which is \ntypically present at a higher concentration than the other analytes, were explored, \nincluding measurement on the wings of the main spectral line at 248.327 nm (\u2018side \npixel registration\u2019) and use of the secondary line at 252.744 nm. The results obtained \nwere in agreement with target values for reference soils, spiked recoveries were > \n92% and LODs were around 5.0 \uf06dg L-1 for Cu, Mn and Zn, 55 \uf06dg L-1 for Fe measured \nat 252.744 nm and 150 \uf06dg L-1 for Fe measured at 248.325 nm. A HR-CS-FAAS \nmethod for the determination of S in plants, based on the 257.961 nm molecular \nabsorption of carbon monosulfide, has been described (in Chinese with English \nabstract) by Wang and Li193.\uf020\n There is still interest in slurry and solid sample introduction for AAS. Flores et \nal.194 prepared pressed pellets containing powdered plant material and high purity \ngraphite which, when burned in O2 in a quartz cell located above the burner in FAAS, \nallowed the quantitative determination of Cd and Pb. The main advantage over \nprevious work was that a larger pellet mass, up to 100 mg (25 mg sample + 75 mg \ngraphite for Cd, 50 mg sample + 50 mg graphite for Pb) could be accommodated, \nleading to improved LODs of 0.012 \uf06dg g-1 for Cd and 0.10 \uf06dg g-1 for Pb. \nElectrothermal AAS with Zeeman effect background correction has been used with \nsolid sampling in the measurement of Cd, Hg, Mn and Pb in aquatic plants195 and with \nslurry sampling in the measurement of Pb and Sn in sediments196. A method for direct \nHg speciation in solid samples, involving controlled thermal release of analytes \nfollowed by quantification by AAS, has been proposed by Shuvaeva et al.197.  \n Relatively few publications have featured developments in electrothermal \natomic absorption spectrometry relevant to soils and plants, although there was one \n 50\nreport198 of an improved matrix modifier (4 \uf06dg palladium + 1600 \uf06dg citric acid + 1000 \n\uf06dg ammonium fluoride) for the measurement of Sn in aqua regia digest with platform \natomisation. One potentially significant advance, however, is the novel atomiser \ndescribed by Gilmutdinov and Nagulin199. This has two independent power supplies, \nallowing the upper and lower parts to be heated at different rates. Atomisation takes \nplace in two stages. The sample is injected, pyrolised and vaporised as normal, but \nvapour is then condensed on the cooler, upper part of the tube. Once condensation is \ncomplete, the upper section is heated rapidly and analyte re-released for measurement. \nPotential interferents that are permanent gases are lost at the primary vaporisation \nstage, and atoms released at the second stage enter a high temperature environment, as \noccurs with platform atomisation. Hence, interference effects are reduced. \n New or improved methods have been proposed for the determination of \nseveral elements by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry. Flow \ninjection HG-AAS was used by Zhang and Adeloju200 for the determination of As, Bi \nand Se in sediments and by Liang  et al.201 for measuring Pb in food, water and soil. \nKozak et al.202 employed HPLC-HG-AAS to study temporal changes in inorganic As \nspeciation in marine sediments deposited on land in SW Thailand by the 2004 \ntsunami. They concluded that the material was enriched in exchangeable forms of As, \nespecially AsIII, relative to local soil and that, although the concentrations of \nexchangeable As did not show a consistent trend, the ratio of AsIII to AsV decreased \nmarkedly following two rainy seasons. Sun and Suo optimised methods for the \nmeasurement of Cd147 and Ni203 in environmental samples and CRMs by HG-ETAAS \nwith in situ trapping of the hydride species in graphite tubes coated with iridium or \niridium-platinum. \n \n 51\n3.2.2 Atomic emission spectrometry \nAlthough no longer widely-used, flame atomic emission spectrometry has remained \npopular with soil scientists for the determination of major cations. A new multi-\nsyringe flow injection system for determining K in soil extracts by FAES has been \ndescribed204. Different interface configurations were compared and problems \npreviously encountered because of variability and interruption in the flow of solution \nto the flame were overcome.  \n Hydride generation inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry \nhas been proposed150 as an alternative to the standard Kjeldahl method for the \nmeasurement of nitrogen in samples of soil, water and fertiliser. Nitrogen species \nwere converted to ammonia and swept into the ICP for measurement at 174 nm. \nAdvantages claimed included higher sample throughput relative to Kjeldahl nitrogen \ndetermination and improved signal-to-noise ratio, sensitivity and limit of detection \nrelative to conventional (non HG) ICP-AES.  \n An improved double chamber electrothermal vaporisation system for AES \nwas described (in Japanese with English abstract)205. Under optimised conditions the \nsystem produced a LOD for Cd of 0.2 ng mL-1. \n \n3.2.3 Atomic fluorescence spectrometry \nChinese workers206, using hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry, have \ndemonstrated that bi-anode electrochemical HG is a successful alternative to chemical \nHG in the determination of As. The method, which had a LOD of 0.64 \uf06dg L-1 and a \nprecision of 2.0% at 60 \uf06dg L-1 (n = 13), gave results consistent with certified values \nfor reference soil GBW07406 and recoveries of 100 \u00b1 3% when used to analyse \n 52\nspiked samples of animal feed. HG-AFS was also used with on-line microwave \nirradiation in a method for speciation of As and Sb207.  \n A new type of atomisation cell for AFS, the single ring electrode radio-\nfrequency capacitively coupled plasma torch, has been proposed by Frentiu et al.208. \nThe torch was used with an electrodeless discharge lamp source and charged coupled \ndetector for the measurement of Cd. A LOD of 4.3 ng mL-1 was obtained. Results for \nanalysis of a reference soil and water sample were close to target values and similar to \ndata obtained by ICP-AES.  \n \n3.2.4 Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry  \n3.2.4.1 Laser ablation ICP-MS  \nStudying the distribution of trace elements in plant tissues by laser ablation ICP-MS \ncan provide useful information on the uptake and translocation of essential and non-\nessential elements. Researchers in Germany have been particularly active in this area, \nin collaboration with workers from Brazil and China. Detailed images of the \ndistribution of Cd, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Pb and Zn in thin sections of Nicotiana tabaccum \n(Tobacco) leaf, shoot and stem have been obtained209. Analytes were quantified using \nmatrix-matched standards (spiked powdered tobacco leaves) and 13C as an internal \nstandard to correct for changes in signal caused by variable sample thickness and \nwater content. Two closely related publications by the same group210-211 describe the \napplication of the approach to the copper-tolerant plant Elsholtzia splendens (Shiny \nelsholtzia) using spiked portions of NIST SRM 1515 Apple leaves for calibration. \nSome of the same data are presented for a third time in a more general article \nconcerning element mapping in biological tissues212, along with other applications, \ne.g. imaging of trace elements in brain tumours and in polyacrylamide gels.  \n 53\n Monticelli et al.213 developed a LA-ICP-MS method for analysis of tree rings \nand applied it to Larix decidua (European larch) growing near a large uranium ore \nbody. Special attention was paid to optimising sample preparation procedures: \nsamples were sanded and then the surface was pre-ablated to remove potential \ncontaminants prior to analysis. Calibration was with respect to pressed pellets of \nhomogenised cedar wood, in which concentrations of trace elements had been \npreviously determined by acid digestion and solution ICP-MS, again using 13C as an \ninternal standard. Analyte concentrations were compared with elemental records from \na lake sediment core to assess whether tree rings represented a suitable archive of \nenvironmental pollution in the area. Data for Cu, U and Zn matched the sedimentary \nrecord, but data for Cd and Pb did not. \n Researchers in Florida214 developed a LA-ICP-MS method for the analysis of \nsoil and sediments that yielded similar results to those from solution ICP-MS and \nwhich they claimed could be used for routine analysis. Grinding the sample to \nparticles of < 1 \uf06dm diameter improved the reproducibility and allowed analysis to be \nperformed without the use of any binder. A British team215 studied microscopic \nuranium oxide grains in soil from the vicinity of a uranium processing plant and \ndiscovered that, although all the particles contained DU, the isotopic composition \nvaried between grains. This case study used MC-ICP-MS to obtain the accurate \n235U\/236U and 235U\/238U ratios necessary for nuclear forensic applications.  \n French researchers developed a novel, in-cell method for isotope dilution \nanalysis216 that yielded results similar to certified values for Cu, Pb, Sn and Zn in soil \nand sediment RMs. Two pellets are mounted in the ablation cell: a sample pellet and a \npellet containing an isotopically enriched solid spike. By using a specialised, low-\npower (<100 \uf06dJ pulse-1) femtosecond IR laser capable of operating at a pulse \n 54\nrepetition rate of 10 kHz, and a fast beam scanning system, it proved possible to \nperform quasi-simultaneous ablation of the two pellets and obtain efficient mixing of \nsample and spike aerosols en route to the plasma. \n \n3.2.4.2 Solution based ICP-MS  \nExamples of analysis of solution samples by MC-ICP-MS include a study of Si \nisotopic composition in plants from a forest in Sweden by Engstrom et al.217 and a re-\nassessment of Pb isotope ratios in peat cores from Canada and Scotland by Kylander \net al.218. An automated on-line method for the measurement of Sr isotopes was \ndeveloped by Galler et al.219 and applied successfully to samples of Asparagus \nofficinalis (Asparagus). \n Coupling of chromatographic methods to ICP-MS continues to be of interest \nbecause of the useful information that hyphenated techniques can provide on trace \nelement speciation in soils and plants. Anion exchange chromatography ICP-MS was \nused to measure phosphate, glyphosphate and aminomethylphosphate in soil \nextracts220. The addition of helium to the octopole collision cell eliminated \ninterference from 14N16O1H+ and 15N16O+ on the measurement of 31P, but reduced the \nsensitivity of the method. Krasnodebska-Ostrega et al.221 also applied IC-ICP-MS to \nstudy Tl speciation in Sinapis alba (Indian mustard), revealing that TlI was the \ndominant species in plant leaf extracts, whilst researchers in Germany used the same \ntechnique to determine Sb species in Pteris vittata (Chinese break fern). Afton and \nCaruso222 used a combination of size exclusion chromatography ICP-MS and \ncapillary reversed phase chromatography ICP-MS to study Hg and Se speciation in \nextracts of Allium fistulosum (Green onion). They found evidence of a Se-Hg \nassociation within a protein-containing macromolecule. \n 55\n Other researchers have performed speciation analysis by combining \nchromatography with elemental and molecular mass spectrometry, usually by \ndirecting components separated in a chromatograph to both ICP-MS and electrospray \nionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). At the University of Cincinnati, researchers \nhave developed a method223 to measure four Se species (SeIV, SeVI, selenomethionine \nand selenocystine) and four As species (AsIII, AsV, MMA and DMA) by ion-pairing \nreversed phase chromatography ICP-MS and ion-pairing reversed phase \nchromatography ESI-ion trap-MS. Analysis takes only 18 minutes and is applicable to \na wide variety of sample matrices, including water, urine and plant extracts. In \nAberdeen, UK, a comparison has been conducted224 between on-line and off-line \nmeasurement of As species in plant extracts by reversed phase-HPLC-ICP-MS\/ESI-\nMS. When root extracts of Thunbergia alata (Black-eyed Susan vine) were prepared \noff-line by SEC and freeze drying, < 2% of the As present was found to be bound to \npeptides, e.g. phytochelatins; when the measurement was conducted directly on the \nextract it was found that 83% of the arsenic was peptide-bound. This large \ndiscrepancy was attributed to instability of As-peptide species during the preliminary \nfractionation and freeze-drying steps. Since freeze-drying may compromise the results \nof As speciation analysis, it was recommended that samples of plant tissue should be \nstored \u2018fresh\u2019 at 193 K. The combination of IC-ICP-MS and ESI-MS was used by an \nAustralian group225 to study Zn-aminopolycarboxylic species in work on chelate-\nassisted phytoremediation of contaminated soil.  \n Other developments in ICP-MS include a new computational method40 to \novercome interferences from hafnium oxide in the determination of Pt in dust and \nlichen by isotope dilution analysis, and a procedure226 to measure 90Sr in the presence \nof high concentrations of 90Zr that was applied to soil samples from the vicinity of the \n 56\nChernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. The isobaric interference was overcome by a \ncombination of sample pre-treatment with a Sr-specific resin (from Eichrom \nTechnologies) and use of oxygen as the reaction gas in the DRC of a quadrupole ICP-\nMS. Direct coupling of asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation to ICP-MS227 has \nfacilitated investigation of the critical role of colloids in the environmental transport \nof PTE. This new method was applied to soil leachates. It provided results for As, Cd, \nSb, Se, Sn and Pb in reasonable agreement with those of a previously validated, off-\nline procedure involving leachate fraction collection, freeze drying and HNO3 \ndigestion.  \n Several review articles have featured ICP-MS: Hou et al.228 described the use \nof the technique in the measurement of 129I in the atmosphere, water, soil, sediments \nand biota (164 references); Komarek et al.46 discussed environmental applications \ninvolving lead isotopes (159 references); Ketterer and Szechenyi50 considered \nhistorical developments and future trends in the determination of Pu and other \ntransuranic elements by, in particular, SF-ICP-MS (182 references). \n \n \n3.2.5 Accelerator mass spectrometry \nApplications in radiocarbon dating are abundant but the only analytical publications \nof note are a review of methods for the measurement of 129I , which includes AMS228, \nand the report that Pu isotopic speciation is, for the first time, possible using the \ncompact AMS instrument housed at the Centro Nacional de Acceleradores in Seville, \nSpain229. \n \n 57\n3.2.6 Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy \nSensei et al.230 published a useful summary of key issues in the application of LIBS to \nsoils and also quantified Cr, Cu, Pb, V and Zn in Italian soils having a range of \ncharacteristics (texture, organic matter, pH, conductivity, CaCO3 content). Chromium \nwas the focus of a study by Gondal et al.231. They optimised and applied a LIBS \nmethod to monitor the remediation of artificially contaminated soils in a laboratory \ntest rig, as a step towards development of a field LIBS system for on-site \ncontamination assessment. However, researchers from the University of Malaga, \nSpain, have already achieved this goal for Pb232. Their LIBS instrument consists of a \nprobe incorporating a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser and associated optics, connected by \nfibre-optics to a compact cross Czerny-Turner spectrometer (spectral range 370 \u2013 460 \nnm) with linear CCD array. The spectrometer, laser power supply and electronic \nsystems fit in a backpack. The instrument is controlled wirelessly by a PDA. \nCalibration was evaluated using pellets containing mixtures of soil and Pb(NO3)2, \nwhich were then digested in 50% HNO3 and analysed by FAAS. Similar results were \nobtained by the two techniques. The LOD of the LIBS measurement at 405.8 nm was \n190 \uf06dg g-1. This proved adequate for the measurement of Pb in situ in material \ndeposited inside a road tunnel with high traffic density, although other workers233 \nhave achieved a lower LOD, 45 \uf06dg g-1, for the measurement of Pb by LIBS using the \nUV emission line at 220.3 nm.\uf020\n Brazilian researchers234 have used linear discriminant analysis to build a soil \nclassification model based on chemometric processing of LIBS spectra. Three \nalgorithms for the selection of variables were compared to obtain the best sub-set of \nspectral data to construct the model: the successive projection algorithm, the genetic \nalgorithm and a stepwise formulation. In contrast, a group from the Canadian Space \n 58\nAgency235 used a priori selection of particular wavelengths corresponding to the \nspectral emissions of specific elements (Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Si and Ti) in their \ndevelopment of an artificial neural network for interpretation of LIBS spectra. The \nresults obtained for major mineral components of rock samples were within 15% of \nXRF data.   \n Particular challenges exist in the LIBS analysis of plants. When high-energy \nlaser pulses are used, the moisture in fresh tissue samples affects the plume dynamics, \nleading to irreproducibility. However, when low-energy is used, the tissue must first \nbe desiccated otherwise emission lines are broad and sensitivity is poor. Ohta et al.236 \ncoated fresh leaves of Rhododendron obtusum (Kurume azalea) or Citrus unshiu \n(Satsuma orange) with metallic colloid and used localised surface plasmon resonance \nto reduce peak widths and enhance signal intensity in the detection of nutrients such \nas Ca and Fe with low-energy (< 1 mJ per pulse) LIBS. The effects of 20 nm and 80 \nnm diameter colloidal silver particles, and 80 nm colloidal gold particles, were \ncompared. Use of 80 nm silver particles was preferred. A LIBS system noted in the \nprevious Update1 for its application to Pb mapping has now been compared with LA-\nICP-MS for imaging of Ag and Cu distribution in leaves of Helianthus annuus \n(Sunflower)237. \nVarious developments in environmental applications of LIBS were discussed \nat the 4th Euro Mediterranean Symposium on Laser Induced Breakdown \nSpectroscopy, Paris, 10\u201313 September 2007, papers from which have been published \nin a special edition of Spectrochimica Acta Part B: Atomic Spectroscopy (Vol 63, \nIssue 10, Oct 2008). Topics covered included the measurement of macronutrients (Ca, \nK, Mg and P)238 and trace elements in plants239; the development and use of portable \nLIBS systems for analysis of soils240-243 and studies aimed at optimising the \n 59\nperformance of the combined Raman\/LIBS instrument244 scheduled to carry out in \nsitu analysis of rocks and soils during the European Space Agency's next mission to \nMars. \n \n3.2.7  X-ray fluorescence spectrometry \nMosselman et al.245 described the first application of the UK\u2019s new national \nsynchrotron facility, Diamond Light Source, to the measurement of PTE in soil \nsamples. The speciation of Pb and Zn in contaminated soil undergoing remediation \nwith bonemeal, and the associations of Ni with iron and manganese oxides in laterite, \nwere investigated. Meanwhile, at the European synchrotron facility in Grenoble, \nEeckhout et al.246 used valence-to-core X-ray emission spectroscopy to study the \nspeciation of Cr. This element is naturally enriched in soils from the city of Turin \nbecause of serpentine in the local area. However, when an urban soil from the city \nwas studied, spectra suggested that Cr was most probably present as the metal, \nphosphides and\/or carbides rather than the expected oxide species. This highly \nsurprising result was attributed to contamination of the sample with anthropogenic Cr \nin the form of waste from a nearby steel-making plant. There has also been interest in  \nsmall X-ray instruments. Optimised operating conditions for the measurement of As, \nCa, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Ni, Pb, Ti, V and Zn in soil and sediment samples247 using the \ncompact MiniPal 4 EDXRF spectrometer have been reported.  \n Lagunas-Solar et al.248 evaluated novel methods for the preparation of plant \ntissue prior to X-ray analysis. Described later in more detail249, the optimised \nprocedure involves the addition of 50 \u2013 100 mg of dried, powdered sample to 3 mL of \n30% H2O2 which is then exposed for 5 min at 90 \u00b0C to pulsed UV photons from a KrF \nexcimer laser (248 nm, 1 x 3 cm2 beam profile, ~ 80 MW cm-2 beam energy). The \n 60\nresulting digest is filtered and then analytes are preconcentrated by co-precipitation as \ncarbamates and collected on membrane filters. PIXE analysis of the membranes \nyielded results close to certified values for NIST SRMs 1570a Spinach leaves and \n1547a Peach leaves. Australian workers250 continued their comparison described in \nour previous Update1 of freeze-drying and freeze-substitution in tetrahydrofuran for \nPTE imaging in hyperaccumulator plants by micro-PIXE. Significant loss of As \noccurred with the freeze-substitution method.  \nAwane et al.251 reported a procedure for grazing exit micro-XRF that involves \nplacing an X-ray absorber, in this case a 2.2 mm thick silicon wafer chip, between the \nplant leaf sample and the detector and measuring at an exit angle of < 2\u00b0. After careful \noptimisation of the measurement geometry, it was possible to measure specifically \nanalytes located on the surface of the leaf, but to exclude analytes inside the leaf. This \nmethod could be especially useful for the measurement of PTE in airborne particles \ndeposited on plant surfaces, without interference from PTE within the plant tissue. \n Several applications of X-ray speciation and mapping have been reported, \nincluding a study of the transport of Cu and Mn across the soil\/root interface in \nPopulus tremuloides (Quaking aspen)252. Use of XANES showed that both elements \nwere reduced, to CuI and MnII, in the rhizosphere. PIXE253 has revealed information \non the accumulation of P in the mycelia of the arbuscular mycorrihizal fungus Glomus \nintraradices and showed that levels of P influence the uptake of other essential \nelements in fungal spores. A combination of genetic, physiological and X-ray \nanalyses revealed new information about the uptake and translocation of Cs in \nArabidopsis thaliana (Thale cress)254. Both micro-SXRF and micro-XANES were \nemployed, and a comparison was made between the wild type and a Cs-tolerant \n 61\nmutant to investigate the biochemical mechanisms involved in Cs toxicity. The \nchemical forms of S in tree rings of the Norway spruce255 have also been studied.  \n Several reviews and comparisons are noteworthy. Necemer et al.256 compared \nEDXRF, TXRF and micro-PIXE with INAA and FAAS for the measurement of Br, \nCa, Cd, Fe, K, Pb, Rb, Sr and Zn in powdered leaves of Thlaspi praecox (Penny cress) \nand Juglans regia (Common walnut). Useful comments were provided on the sample \npreparation requirements, cost of equipment, analytical characteristics (LODs, \naccuracy, precision) and scope and applicability of the techniques. A review (150 \nreferences)257 of the application of TXRF to a broad range of biological samples \nincludes information on methods for the analysis of plant extracts and exudates. \nProgress relating specifically to the measurement of PTE in vegetal samples by XRF \nis discussed by Margui et al.258.\uf020\n \n3.3 Analytical quality control \nThe preparation of a new certified reference material, NIST SRM 2701 CrVI in \ncontaminated soil, has been described259. This material was created in response to the \ngrowing need for evaluation of sites contaminated with chromite ore processing \nresidue. It has a CrVI content of approximately 500 mg kg-1. Japanese workers260 have \nproduced a series of standard soils for XRF analysis by spiking forest soil with \naqueous standard solutions, whilst a French team173 used a specially adapted sample \npreparation procedure to obtain new information on magnesium isotopic composition \nin plant CRMs. \n Inter-laboratory comparison exercises have focused on the measurement of \ntotal Hg in soils, sediments and fish tissue261, total PTE in soils262, Cd and Pb in the \nmedicinal plant Herba Desmodii Styracifolii263 and CrVI in soil259, the latter in \n 62\nassociation with the creation of the CRM described in the previous paragraph. Yip et \nal.264 have reviewed international inter-comparisons conducted under the auspices of \nthe Comit\u00e9 Consultatif pour la Quantit\u00e9 de Mati\u00e8re in the period 1998 to 2007.

For bulk rock analysis, RMs supplied by the USGS \nand GSJ continue to be popular because of their homogeneity, extensive \ncharacterisation and wide range of rock types. However, most of these materials are \nnot certified by ISO-compatible procedures and there is rarely a proper assessment of \nuncertainty. Much effort continues to be directed at providing new high precision data \nfor RMs, thus enabling reliable up-to-date reference values to be determined. \nAlthough many RMs exist, the review concludes that there is still a pressing need for \nmore, particularly certified rock RMs, homogeneous RMs suitable for mineral \nmicroanalysis and well characterised RMs for isotope determinations, including so-\ncalled delta zero materials for normalisation in stable isotope analysis. \nMany geoanalysts will appreciate the investment made by the Max-Planck \nInstitute in Germany in establishing the GeoReM database. This resource \n(http:\/\/georem.mpch-mainz.gwdg.de) currently contains information on ca. 1800 RMs \nrelevant to analytical geochemistry and environmental research, including \u201cpreferred \nvalues\u201d and their uncertainties. It is important, however, that not only geoanalysts but \nthose who interpret geochemical data appreciate the role of RMs in providing \nconfidence in the quality of the data and the associated uncertainties. It was therefore \npleasing to note an article in Chemical Geology293 that emphasizes the importance of \n 71\nRMs and the inclusion of RM data in papers to demonstrate the validity of \ngeochemical results. \nA geochemical database of thirty-five RMs from four countries was used to \nevaluate the performance of nine single outlier tests with thirteen variants294. They \nconcluded that the kurtosis test was the most powerful one for detecting discordant \noutliers in such geochemical RM databases. This contribution was part of an ongoing \nexercise to review statistical methods for processing such databases and should be \nuseful for identifying discordant outliers in many other fields. \nNew concentration data for Ag, Au and Ir by INAA in 70 geochemical RMs, \ncovering a broad compositional range, have been published295. Values for Cd and Hg \nwere also presented for some of these materials. Reliable results for Au and Ir down \nto concentrations of a few ng g-1 were obtained, whereas the relatively high LOD for \nAg precluded its detection below 0.1 \u00b5g g-1.  A particularly high RSD for Au (45%) \nwas reported for WMG-1 (mineralised gabbro PGE material from CCRMP), which \nwas attributed to the heterogeneous distribution of Au particles at the scale of a 2 g \ntest portion. The Ir concentration in the serpentinite UB-N (CRPG, France) compared \nfavourably to published results obtained by ID ICP-MS methods but heterogeneity \nwas inferred for Au, Hg and Sb. During an evaluation of a Milestone DMA-80 \nmercury analyser296, values for Hg in 33 stream sediment and soil RMs were \ndetermined. The DMA-80 produced results that were in close agreement with \npublished data for all samples except one, with a LOD of 1 ng g-1.  Concentrations of \nNb and Ta in a variety of glass RMs were determined by LA-ICP-QMS using a 193 \nnm ArF excimer laser297. Analytical precision was less than 10% at contents greater \nthan 0.1 \u00b5g g-1. The results suggested that the reference values for Nb and Ta in NIST \nSRM 610 published by Pearce and co-workers in 1997 need to be revised upwards by \n 72\n16% for Nb and 28% for Ta. It was concluded that most of the measurement \nuncertainty in the original data was analytical rather than due to chemical \nheterogeneities on a scale of 24 \u00b5m.  \nTwo new candidate mineral RMs have been characterised by the Smithsonian \nInstitution specifically for the analysis of micas and feldspars in granitic \npegmatites298. Stewart lepidolite (STL-1) and Zapot amazonite (ZA-1) were sourced \nfrom pegmatite deposits with unusually high Cs and Rb concentrations. They \nimproved the accuracy of XRF measurements of micas and feldspars by eliminating \nthe need to extrapolate calibrations based on existing RMs. Progress has been made in \nfinding a RM suitable for the microanalysis of rutile in applications such as Zr \nthermometry, provenance studies and U-Pb dating299. Four rutile crystals, about a \ncentimetre across, were shown to be homogeneous to within \u00b110% for many of 15 \ntrace elements determined by a variety of techniques299. The trace element \nconcentrations of the crystals span a broad compositional range and provisional values \nfor Hf, Nb, Sb, Sn, Ta, U, W and Zr were reported. One of the grains had a relatively \nhigh U content and provided U-Pb ages that were in excellent agreement with its \nregional geological context. Data indicated that some of the grains may also be useful \nas calibration material for in situ Hf isotope studies.    \nThe rapid growth in studies of many new isotope systems has resulted in an \nincreasing demand for well characterised RMs for isotope determinations, including \nmaterials with well defined delta zero values for normalisation300. New data supplied \nby Blichert-Toft301 supports the use of the 91500 zircon for interlaboratory \ncomparisons of radiogenic Hf isotope determinations. She argued that the larger \nspread in 176Hf\/177Hf from in situ measurements, compared with data from solution \nchemistry, probably reflected uncertainties arising from the corrections required for \n 73\nprominent isobaric overlaps inherent in the analytical protocol for in situ analysis, \nrather than any significant heterogeneity. She provided a recommended value for the \nHf isotopic composition of 91500 zircon, calculated by pooling her mean value with \nthose from published studies using solution chemistry. The GJ-1 zircon series, derived \nfrom African pegmatites, distributed by GEMOC302 is an alternative source of RMs \nfor in situ measurements of 176Hf\/177Hf.  Twenty four splits from two different GJ-1 \nzircons were analysed by solution ID MC-ICP-MS to determine their Lu\/Hf and Hf \nisotopic compositions (as well as Hf and Lu contents). Isotope measurements by LA-\nMC-ICP-MS, using a 193 nm excimer laser, yielded homogeneous 176Hf\/177Hf data \nidentical to the value, within analytical uncertainties, to that obtained from the \nsolution work. Nasdala et al.303 proposed zircon M257 as a RM for the determination \nof U-Pb ages by SIMS. This flawless, cut gemstone specimen from Sri Lanka satisfies \nthe requirements for such a candidate material, in that it is homogeneous, has a \nconcordant U-Pb isotopic system, a very low level of non-radiogenic Pb, as well as \nrelatively high Pb and U concentrations, resulting in high count rates and good \ncounting statistics. Its characteristics make zircon M257 a desirable RM for other \nmicroprobe techniques, such as LA-ICP-MS. However, the decision has been taken to \nrestrict its use to ion microprobe laboratories to ensure its continued availability for at \nleast one decade. New gravimetrically prepared U isotope RMs, the IRMM-074 \nseries, have been prepared and certified304. Although primarily designed for the \nnuclear industry, these materials may be of interest to geoanalysts for the calibration \nof secondary electron multipliers widely used in isotope mass spectrometry. Two \nprocedures, one static and the other dynamic, were proposed to assess the linearity of \nelectron multipliers in MC-ICP-MS and TIMS instruments respectively. \n 74\n The measurement of boron isotopes presents many challenges, including \nobtaining comparable results from SIMS, TIMS and ICP-MS. Because previous \nattempts to assess systematic differences in B isotope determinations produced a \nspread of data much greater than that predicted from the reported precisions, \nAggarwal et al.305 organised an inter-laboratory comparison based on materials that \ndid not require any sample preparation. Two liquid standards (designated JABA and \nJABB), spanning the known natural range of B isotope ratios, were synthesized from \nsalts enriched in 11B and 10B. Each laboratory was asked to measure the two boric acid \nliquid standards relative to an aliquot of NBS 951 also provided and to include an \nuncertainty estimate. There was no bias between the different analytical techniques, \nalthough it was noted that the ICP-MS techniques may produce higher \u03b411B values if \nthe Ar4+ ion is not resolved out adequately. It was observed that the uncertainties in \nthe measurement of \u03b411B were often underestimated \u2013 a common complaint in such \nexercises! Guidelines to assist the comparison of measurements between different \nlaboratories were proposed.  \nThree methods were employed to measure the abundance of 9Be in geological \nRMs JA-2 (andesite) and JB-2 (basalt) from the GSJ306. These materials were chosen \nfor this study because their 9Be content had been determined previously by another \nresearch group. Consistent 9Be data were obtained by ICP-QMS using standard \naddition and column separation methods, whereas reliance on a method employing an \nindium internal standard gave results that were about 10% lower. The 10Be abundance \nmeasurements were made on five occasions over a ten month period; the uncertainty \nof the 10Be\/9Be ratio was estimated to be 10% (1\u03c3).  \n Revised reference values for IAEA sulfur isotope RMs S-2 and S-3 have been \nrecommended by workers from NIST307. These RMs are chemically pure and \n 75\nhomogenous silver sulfide materials, synthesized from a gypsum and sphalerite \nrespectively. The revised values were determined using gas source IRMS and double \nspike multi-collector TIMS. The latter technique provided an independent method \nfrom the more traditional gas analyses, and gave confidence that the revised values \nwere unbiased as well as being more precise than previous ones.   \nVariations in Ca isotopes can be used to study biomineralisation processes. \nThe matrix of NIST SRMs 915a and 915b (artificial calcium carbonate) make them \nsuitable for the analysis of marine organisms that have calcite structures, such as \nforaminifera, coral or coccolithophores. In contrast, NIST SRM 1486 (bone meal) is \nmore appropriate for studies of vertebrate organisms with an apatitic skeleton. With \nthis application in mind, Heuser and Eisenhauer308 have published \u03b444Ca\/40Ca values \nfor SRM 915b (a replacement for SRM 915a which is out of stock) and SRM 1486; \nthe isotope ratios are quoted relative to SRM 915a. \n  \n4.2   Solid sample introduction  \n4.2.1 Laser ablation ICP-MS \nFor an overview of recent trends in LA-ICP-MS with special reference to the Earth \nsciences, an authoritative article by Sylvester309 should be consulted (105 refs). As \nnoted in last year\u2019s Update1, which covers a similar time period to Sylvester\u2019s review, \nthe main themes include: the potential of fs lasers; ablation cell design; fractionation \nstudies and in situ isotope measurements. In addition, he provides a critique of \nmeasurement uncertainties in LA-ICP-MS, taking examples from trace element \ndeterminations in mineral, pressed powder or fused beads, and radiometric ages \nderived from U-(Th)-Pb measurements. Total uncertainties for trace element \nconcentrations were estimated to be ca. 10% (95% confidence limits) when errors on \n 76\nthe calibration values of RMs are taken into account. Similarly, the ages claimed for \nzircon and other U-rich accessory phases may only be accurate to about 2% (2sd) \nwhen uncertainties associated with Pb\/U fractionation are included.    \n Although LA-ICP-MS is a relatively mature technique, improvements in its \nanalytical performance, particularly to reduce matrix-dependent fractionation, are still \ndesirable. A group at ISAS Dortmund310 have provided practical suggestions for \nimproved performance with both fs and ns laser technology, along with ideas for \nfuture experiments for a better understanding of the relevant processes. In a study of \naerosol transport in LA-ICP-MS, W\u00e4lle and co-workers311 measured detection \nefficiencies (defined as the ratio of ions reaching the detector to atoms released by \nLA) of silicate glasses, zircon and pure silicon using UV-ns- and NIR-fs-LA-ICP-\nQMS protocols. The detection efficiency for ns-LA of silicate glass using helium as \nthe in-cell carrier gas was almost independent of laser wavelength and pulse duration. \nIn contrast, the use of argon as the carrier gas suppressed the detection efficiency by \nup to a factor of 5 through less efficient conversion of the aerosol to ions and poorer \nion transmission inside the ICP-MS instrument. Because aerosol expansion within the \nablation cell can be a significant source of non-stoichiometric sampling, Hu et al.312 \ndevised a means of sampling the aerosol plume close to the ablation site of a 193 nm \nexcimer laser. They monitored the composition of the expanding plume at different \npositions by changing the sampling distance between the nozzle tip of the gas outlet \nand the ablation site. Placing the nozzle tip inside the ablation cell led to an increase \nin peak height and reduction in signal width. This in turn shortened the washout time \nto approximately 2 s and almost eliminated the effects of aerosol recirculation in the \ncell. However, the positioning of the nozzle tip inside the cell was critical and further \neffort is required to develop the strategy for routine use. \n 77\n The analytical performance of fs lasers continues to attract attention. The \ncapability of a fs laser operating at 785 nm was assessed by replicate spot analysis of \nNIST and USGS glasses for 63 major, minor and trace elements313. A NIST SRM 612 \nglass was used as an external standard for calibration and 43Ca as an internal standard \nto correct for matrix effects, drift and ablated mass. The measured concentrations \nwere within 10% of the published values for most elements with RSDs of <10% in \nmost cases, with little evidence of matrix effects. The authors felt that more work was \nrequired to establish the relative benefits of using fs lasers with different wavelengths, \ni.e. IR versus UV, as there did not appear to be any obvious advantages to compensate \nfor the extra complexities of working in the UV. Ikehata et al.314 demonstrated the use \nof a fs laser system operating at 780 nm, coupled with MC-ICP-MS, for the \nmeasurement of the Cu isotopic composition of pure copper metal and Cu-rich \nminerals at spot sizes down to 15 \u00b5m. The precision and accuracy obtained were \ncomparable to those obtained by conventional solution MC-ICP-MS, e.g. 0.05\u2030 (2sd) \nfor long term reproducibility, and significantly better than previous data for in situ Cu \nisotope determinations by ns LA-MC-ICP-MS. \n The use of liquid standards for calibration with fs LA-ICP-MS has \nbeen explored315. Silicate glasses and brass were ablated at 265 nm in either single \nspot or scanning mode. Ablated aerosols were mixed with nebulised standards, either \nas a liquid or desolvated aerosol, using a Y-piece just before entry into an ICP-QMS \ninstrument. Similar precisions were achieved under wet and dry plasma conditions, \nalthough selective loss of Cu occurred inside the desolvation unit. Liquid standards \nhave the advantage of providing more flexibility in calibration strategies for a wide \nrange of solids; in addition, better precisions can be attained because of the smaller \nuncertainty in their nominal values compared to solid standards. However, the \n 78\nfractionation effects observed for Zn and Cd in liquid calibration standards limits their \napplication in LA-ICP-MS generally.  \nMost analysis by LA-ICP-MS relies on one or more internal standards to \ncorrect for the varying mass of material ablated, either calculated from stoichiometry \nor obtained by an alternative analytical technique.  Consequently, an analytical \nstrategy that does not involve the use of internal standards is of interest. One method \nproposed for silicate minerals was to determine a comprehensive set of elements by \nLA-ICP-MS, convert them to equivalent oxide concentrations, scale the oxides to \n100% and then convert them back to elemental concentrations316. It was concluded \nthat oxide scaling produced data of similar accuracy and precision to those obtained \nusing either NIST SRM 610 as an external calibration standard or a Ca, Fe or Si \ninternal standard when analysing a range of glass CRMs. In a similar approach by Liu \nand co-workers317, an ablation yield correction factor (AYCF), calculated by \nnormalising the sum of the metal oxides to 100 wt%, was used to correct for the \nabsolute amount of material ablated. By applying an AYCF and employing several \nUSGS reference glasses for calibration, it was shown that MPI-DING glasses could be \nanalysed with an accuracy of better than 5% for major elements and between 5-10% \nfor most trace elements, without any internal standardisation. Major element data for \nanhydrous minerals were generally consistent, within 5% uncertainty, with those \nobtained by EPMA, but minerals containing higher concentrations of anions (Cl, F, S \nand OH) were not amenable to this strategy as all the matrix elements need to be \ndetermined for good accuracy.  \n Routine geological applications of LA-ICP-MS abound as commercial \ninstrumentation finds its way into more laboratories worldwide. Ablating NiS buttons \nto determine PGEs has been tried many times as a way of circumventing the need for \n 79\nchemical dissolution. Resano et al.318 devised a protocol to obtain accurate PGE \nconcentrations with RSDs below 10% and LODs around 10 ng g-1 when analysing \nplatiniferous ores. This involved sampling 40-75 g of ore, grinding the NiS buttons, \npreparing a pellet of the powder using a polyethylene wax binder, ablating a line \nprofile for 2-3 minutes per sample, using ammonia in a DRC to cope with all the \nspectral interferences and preparing matrix-matched calibration standards, combined \nwith monitoring 61Ni as an internal standard. The key factor in an improved \nprotocol214 for the analysis of soils and sediments by LA-ICP-MS was the reduction \nof the particle size to less than 1 \u00b5m. This provided representative sampling at the \nmicro-scale, as well as better cohesion of the samples so that powder pellets could be \nmade without the addition of a binder. Muller and co-workers319 found that the \naccuracy of P determinations in crystalline quartz by LA-ICP-MS was comprised by \nan ICP-MS related background interference. Because published concentrations of P \nfor a suite of RMs were poorly constrained, the RMs were analysed by phosphorus \naccelerator implantation and SIMS to provide independent and precise values on \nwhich to base the LA-ICP-MS calibration. However, the source of the 31P background \nremained unclear and had to be corrected for empirically. It has been demonstrated \nthat an excimer 193 nm LA system in conjunction with ICP-QMS is capable of \nproducing accurate REE data in a variety of reference glasses at a spatial resolution of \n24 \u00b5m320.   \n Laser ablation ICP-MS is currently one of the most sensitive and versatile \nmicroanalytical technique for determining the composition of fluid inclusions. The \ndetermination of S in fluid inclusions, however, is problematical because of its high \nfirst ionisation potential, polyatomic interferences from oxygen dimers on 32S and 34S \nand high blank levels. Guillong et al.321 found that ICP-QMS and SF-ICP-MS were \n 80\nequally well suited to the measurement of S in quartz, within certain limitations. The \nprecision and accuracy, which were comparable for the two techniques, were not \nlimited by interferences, but by an unknown source of S contamination in the quartz \nhost mineral. Nevertheless, a method employing a careful baseline correction was \ndeveloped to determine S as part of a multielemental suite, providing a LOD for S of \nca. 100 \u00b5g g-1 in brine inclusions of 60 \u00b5m diameter. Recent experiments have shown \nthat stray light from a 193 nm excimer laser can permanently modify the gas species \nin adjacent fluid inclusions322. Ablation for 40 s with a laser fluence of ~24 J cm-2 \nproduced new gas species in inclusions up to 210 \u00b5m from the pit. These changes \nwere attributed to molecular photodissociation induced by stray UV laser light. \nAlthough there was no evidence of any changes in the bulk chemistry of the \ninclusions, modification in the gas species would impact on temperatures calculated \nfrom microthermometry or Raman analysis, thus making it important to undertake \nthese measurements on fluid inclusions prior to LA-ICP-MS.  \n There is no doubt that LA-MC-ICP-MS has had a dramatic impact on the field \nof isotope geochemistry over the last decade. A review of recent isotope ratio \napplications (146 refs)3 noted a significant increase in publications in areas such as \npalaeoclimate and oceanography as a result of more funding opportunities in research \nassociated with climate change.  \nDevelopments in geochronology continue to be of widespread interest, \nparticularly dating of zircons in studies of the timing and nature of crustal and mantle \nevents323. Key developments in LA-ICP-MS instrumentation and recent advances in \nU-Pb zircon geochronology have been reviewed by Cocherie and Robert324. To \ndemonstrate the capabilities of the technique compared to TIMS and SIMS, they \nanalysed four zircons covering a ages from 290 to 2440 Ma using a 213 nm laser \n 81\ncoupled to an MC-ICP-MS instrument equipped with a multi-ion counting system; \nthis allowed static acquisition of all peaks of interest with high sensitivity. Precisions \nof better than 1% and 3% (2 sigma) were obtained for 207Pb\/206Pb and 206Pb\/238U \nrespectively. They concluded that the expected improvements in laser systems and the \ntechnology of ion counters  should result in the performance of LA-ICP-MS rivalling \nthat of SIMS for in situ age determinations. In order to overcome the complications \nassociated with analysing intricately zoned zircon crystals, Johnston and colleagues325 \ndeveloped a novel method of sampling and analysing zircon volumes as small as 12-\n14 \u00b5m in diameter and 4-5 \u00b5m in depth (<3 ng of zircon). Channeltron detectors were \nrequired to monitor the intensities of the Pb peaks because of the low yields from the \nsmall diameter craters and slow laser pulse rate. The U-Pb isotopes were measured by \nMC-ICP-MS, using a 30-second acquisition routine followed by data reduction offline \nbased on a total ion counting method; the measurement errors were calculated as a \nfunction of the number of counts. This rapid small-volume protocol was able to \nreproduce the ages of eight zircon standards to within 2% of published ages obtained \nby ID-TIMS. An automated method for U-Pb dating of zircon by LA-SF-ICP-MS \nwith a single collector was described by Frei and Gerdes326.  Accurate and precise U-\nPb ages were obtained from single spots with relatively high spatial resolution (20-30 \n\u00b5m wide and 15-20 \u00b5m deep) in ablation times of 30 s. The analytical points were \npreset so that data could be acquired in automated mode for up to 16 hours per day. \nProven calibration and data reduction strategies were employed to correct for \nelemental fractionation, sample transport, ionisation and instrumental mass bias. \nProtocols devised for U-Pb dating of zircons by LA-MC-ICP-MS have been \nsuccessfully applied to the isotopic analysis of microscopic uranium oxide grains215. \nPrecision and accuracy were assessed by replicate analyses of natural uraninite grains \n 82\nand the relative uncertainty for 235U\/238U was 0.2% (2\u03c3). Previous research \ndemonstrated that 207Pb\/206Pb could be monitored accurately during Hf isotope \ndeterminations in homogenous zircon chips without degrading the Hf isotope data. \nThis strategy was applied to the analysis of zircons with complicated growth \nhistories327. The concurrent measurement of Pb and Hf isotopes was conducted in an \nalternating two cycle routine. Although the 207Pb\/206Pb ratio by itself is not an \nunambiguous indicator of the time of zircon growth, particularly in complex systems, \nthe estimated ages were used to detect changes between domains of different ages \nduring ablation, which might otherwise led to inaccurate Hf isotope ratios and \nspurious geological interpretations. The technique was applied to a case study of \ndetrital zircons from modern river sands in the Himalayas. Of relevance is a study by \nKent328 who compared measurements of Pb isotope ratios by LA-MC-ICP-MS using \nparallel Faraday cup and ion counter detector array with those made using solely \nFaraday cups328. He demonstrated that both approaches produced accurate and precise \ndata, although where the Pb ion beam was expected to be relatively small, the \ncombined Faraday cup and ion counter array provided a significant improvement in \nprecision.    \nCaddock and co-workers329 investigated strategies for making accurate 34S\/32S \nmeasurements by HR-MC-ICP-MS in sufide and sulphate minerals using solution and \nlaser ablation sample introduction. Major isobaric interferences from molecular O2+ \nions were removed by applying sufficient mass resolution and determining S \nintensities on interference-free plateaus. Memory effects and residual oxygen-tailing \nwere small, typically <0.2\u2030, and mathematically removed by on-peak zero \nsubtraction and by bracketing samples with standards giving similar signal intensities \n(within 20%). However, matrix effects were shown to be significant, up to 0.7\u2030, \n 83\nmaking it essential to use appropriate matrix-matched standards to correct for \ninstrumental mass bias.   \n \n4.2.2  Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy \nThe LIBS technique is an option when fast, inexpensive in situ analysis is required. \nFor this reason LIBS has found application in the mining and mineral processing \nindustries. Because LIBS is a surface technique, a link between the sample surface \nand the bulk composition has to be assumed or demonstrated. Researchers from \nCSIRO Minerals in Australia330 have explored the combination of LIBS and principle \ncomponents regression for fast and accurate multi-elemental analysis of iron ore \npellets. Robust calibration models were determined for Al, Fe, K and Si, while the \nresults for Mn were \u201cencouraging\u201d. Phosphorus, present at low levels in the ores, \nproved to be the most difficult element to determine accurately. The next step would \nbe to transfer this protocol to the analysis of loose chipped material at the mine site \nand on conveyor belts. Another geological application of LIBS is the analysis of \ncrusts in karstic formations331. A portable LIBS system has been developed and \nassessed for the in situ characterisation of speleothems in a large cave system in \nSpain. A laser beam from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser was focussed onto the target \nsurface and the plasma emission collected by a fibre optic cable and guided to the slit \nof a compact spectrometer. The irregular morphology of the cave system did not \naffect the instrument, although other factors such as the high humidity had to be \novercome. Qualitative measurements of Al, C, Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Sr, Si and Ti were \nobtained, together with depth profiles of Sr\/Ca ratios that could be used as indicators \nfor paleoclimatology and paleohydrology. \n \n 84\n4.3 Sample treatment \n4.3.1   Sample dissolution \nThe quality of analytical data is often limited by the manner in which the samples are \nprepared prior to measurement. Thus a reminder of some of the key aspects of \npreparing environmental samples for analysis is always welcome332, although much of \nthis review is primarily concerned with waters.  \n A two-stage microwave-assisted digestion procedure using HNO3, HCl, HF \nand H3BO3 has been developed for the analysis of sulfide ores by ICP-AES333. In the \nfirst stage, 0.2 g of sample was digested with a combination of HNO3, HCl and HF in \na closed Teflon vessel in a microwave oven at 200 \u00b0C for 30 min. After cooling, \nH3BO3 was added and the vessel reheated to 170 \u00b0C for 15 min. Analysis of six \nCRMs indicated recoveries between 95 and 105%, with precisions of 5% or better, for \na range of major and trace elements. In the absence of a published method for the \nmicrowave digestion of komatiites (primitive lava), Nna-Mvondo et al.334 devised \ntheir own based on a two-step procedure, which they found to be more effective than \na single one. A combination of HF, HNO3 and water was employed in the first \ndigestion step, which was followed by drying down on a hot plate at 105 \u00b0C and \nadding HCl to the residue, before the second microwave digestion. Two USGS basalt \nCRMs were analysed for 17 elements by ICP-MS. Acceptable recoveries of 90-120% \nwere obtained, except for Cu (51%) and Pb (165%) in BCR-2; a mitigating factor may \nbe that the concentrations supplied by USGS for these elements are information \nvalues only. \n In the Carius tube method, which is often used to digest refractory PGE \nminerals, the samples are dissolved in aqua regia in a sealed glass tube at high \n 85\ntemperatures. However, Qi and Zhou335 demonstrated that this procedure \nunderestimated the total PGE content of an ultramafic rock, because some of the PGE \nremained in the silicate residue. Complete recoveries were obtained by treating the \nresidue from the Carius tube digestion with HF and combining the resulting solution \nwith that from the Carius tube prior to Os distillation.    \n A combination of HNO3 and HF is conventionally employed in the acid \ndigestion of silicate rocks, often in conjunction with HClO4.  However, a safer \nsubstitute for HF is desirable as many laboratories prohibit its use because of its \nhighly corrosive and toxic nature. Mariert and co-workers170 assessed the use of \nammonium fluoride in place of HF and HClO4 in an acid digestion of three CRMs, \nincluding a basalt and a soil. More H2O2 was employed, compared to the method with \nHF and HClO4, to compensate for the oxidising effect of HClO4. The results obtained \nfor up to 16 elements by ICP-MS were within 10% of the reference values, with \nprecisions of 8% or better. It was concluded that the procedure with NH4F was as \neffective as that using HF and HClO4, although the presence of NH4F provided new \npossibilities for polyatomic interferences through the formation of complexes with \nNH3, as well as the potential for elements like As, Sb and Ta to form colloidal \nhydroxides in ammoniacal solutions.  \n4.3.2 Separation and preconcentration \nIn recent years, many alternative substances have explored to improve the separation \nand preconcentration of trace elements in solid-phase extractions. Some that have \nfound utility in this respect are carbon nanotubes, ion-imprinted polymers, biosorbents \nand nanometer material. An overview of the application of these and other solid \nsorbants in analytical procedures has been published336. The potential of multiwalled \ncarbon nanotubes (MWTs) for the separation and preconcentration of Au in \n 86\ngeological and water samples has been investigated108. Gold was adsorbed \nquantitatively on a microcolumn packed with MWTs and then eluted with 3% \nthiourea in 1 mol L-1 HCl prior to measurement by FAAS; an enrichment factor of 75 \nwas achieved.  \nThe extraction chromatography resins UTEVA and TRU, produced by \nEichrom Technologies, have found widespread application in the separation of one or \nmore of the actinide elements. A systematic study of the properties of these two resins \nhas been undertaken using model solutions and geological RMs spiked with 232Th, \n238U, 237Np, 239Pu and 241Am337. The first four nuclides were determined \nsimultaneously by ICP-MS; 241Am was measured by \u03b3-spectrometry. A procedure for \nseparating Pu, Th and U on UTEVA resin was successfully applied to different \nsample types, whereas another one for the separation of Am, Pu, Th and U using TRU \nresin still required validation. \n A fusion or sinter with Na2O2 prior to measurement by ICP-MS is a powerful \nmethod for the determination of REE concentrations in geological materials. In a \nmodified procedure for the determination of low levels of REE in ultramafic and \nsulfide samples, Sun and Sun338 used graphite crucibles for the Na2O2 fusion at 750 \n\u00b0C. The REE were then separated and preconcentrated by inorganic coprecipitation \nassisted by triethanolamine, before determination by ICP-MS following a 20-fold \ndilution. Limits of detection ranged from 4.46 ng g-1 for Ce to 0.02 ng g-1 for Tm and \nthe blanks were shown to be comparable to those obtained from a HF-HClO4 acid \ndigestion; it should be noted that the comparison values were published in 1992! \nBalaram339 has reviewed methods for the determination of PGEs in \nexploration studies. He concluded that, in spite of advances in instrumental methods, \ntraditional fire assay methods will not be replaced in the near future because of the \n 87\nadvantages they offer in terms of the relatively large mass of sample analysed and \nspecialised sample attack for difficult materials such as chromite. \nA two-step process for the determination of Se in small quantities (c. 50 mg) \nof sulfide minerals was developed340. After dissolution in 2M HNO3, transition metals \nwere removed by precipitation as metal hydroxides under alkaline conditions to \nprevent sorption of Se, followed by further metal removal by chelating resin. Analysis \nof the RM CCu-1c, a copper concentrate supplied by CCRMP, by HG high resolution \nICP-MS demonstrated quantitative Se recoveries of 100 \u00b1 5% with a LOD of 4 \u00b5g g-1. \n Separation chemistries for isotope ratio measurements continue to evolve. A \nnew method developed for the sequential separation of Pb, Nd and Sr was designed to \nminimise the number of evaporation steps341. This resulted in a higher throughput, \nespecially when MC-ICP-MS was employed, although the solutions prepared were \nalso suitable for TIMS. After a HF-HClO4 digestion, the isotopes of interest were \npurified in a three-step separation procedure. The first column, containing Sr resin, \nseparated Sr and Pb from the REE. In the second stage, the light REE were collected \non a column packed with the cation exchange resin AG50W-X10. Finally Nd was \nseparated from Sm on a column containing Ln resin. Measurements of Nd and Sr \nisotope ratios in RM JB-3 (basalt, GSJ) verified the chemistry and mass spectrometry \nstrategies in this study. Makishima and Nakamura342 devised a method of \npreconcentrating Hf, Mo, Nb, Ta, W and Zr by coprecipitation with titanium and \napplied it to studies of the Lu-Hf isotope system. Silicate RMs (basalt and peridotite) \nwere digested with HF-HClO4 after the addition of titanium and Lu\/Hf spike \nsolutions. Subsequent drying to eliminate fluorine encouraged the formation of \ntitanium compounds. The sample was then dissolved in nitric acid and centrifuged to \ncollect the titanium oxide\/hydroxide precipitate. The supernatant containing Lu, Nd, \n 88\nPb, Sm and Sr was retained and used to determine isotope ratios by MC-ICP-MS after \nsequential purification. The Ti precipitate was redissolved and Hf was separated from \nthe other elements using UTEVA column chemistry. The yields for Hf, Mo, Nb, Ta, \nW and Zr were between 84 and 98% and total blanks of 16, 2.4, 3, 11, 0.4 and 60 pg \nwere reported for Hf, Lu, Nd, Pb, Sm and Sr respectively. Magnesium isotope ratios \nhave been determined in a wide variety of environmental materials, including silicate \nand carbonate rocks, using an adaptation of two existing methods for the separation of \nMg from complex matrices173. After dissolution, transition metals were removed \nusing an AG-MP1 anion-exchange resin, and then the Mg was separated from alkali \n(Na, K) and bivalent cations (Ca2+, Mn2+ and Sr2+) by two passes through a column \ncontaining AG50W-X12 cation-exchange resin.  Magnesium recoveries of 100\u00b18% \nwere achieved. The Mg isotope ratios of 11 RMs were determined using two different \nMC-ICP-MS instruments and the \u03b426Mg values plotted against the corresponding \npublished values. All points lay on a 1:1 line, showing that the Mg separation protocol \ndid not induce any systematic shift in the Mg isotope ratios. The long term \nreproducibility, assessed by repeated measurements of Mg standard solutions and \nnatural RMs, was 0.14\u2030. \n \n4.3.3 Speciation studies \nFor a full discussion of developments in elemental speciation, the recent Update on \nthis subject should be consulted141. \n Procedures developed for the determination of organotin compounds in \nmarine sediments are often a compromise between cost, availability of equipment and \nthe efficacy of separation, sensitivity and selectivity. Consequently, numerous \nmethods for their determination have been published. In their review of the analytical \n 89\ntechniques available, Staniszewska and co-workers343 supply practical solutions to \nsome of the problems most frequently encountered in such analysis. Expensive \nequipment and time-consuming analytical procedures are normally required to \nseparate the organotin species from a complex organic matrix and preconcentrate \nthem to a level that permits their measurement by highly selective and sensitive \nchromatographic techniques. One such example is the method involving headspace \nsingle drop microextraction combined with GC-ICP-MS detection reported by Xiao et \nal.344. However, a low cost procedure, based on HPLC with UV detection, has been \ndeveloped for butyltins in sediment and water samples345. The extraction involved the \nuse of hexane containing 0.05-0.5% tropolone and 0.2% NaCl in water at pH 1.7. \nSeparation of the butyltins was performed in isocratic mode on an ultra cyanopropyl \ncolumn with a mobile phase of hexane containing 5% THF and 0.03% acetic acid. \nThe efficacy of this method was confirmed using standard GC-MS techniques, with \nLODs of 0.70 \u00b5g ml-1 for TBT and 0.50 \u00b5g ml-1 for DBT, similar to those obtained by \nGC-MS. A new self-tuning single mode focussed microwave technology has been \nevaluated for the extraction of organotin (and organomercury) compounds from \nmarine sediments and organisms346. The results obtained using species-specific ID \nGC-MS demonstrated that MBT, DBT and TBT could be extracted quantitatively in a \nfast, reliable and routine manner. \n A review183 (176 refs) of chemical reagents employed to extract different Hg \nspecies from soils and sediments concluded that there was little consensus, and that a \nstandard protocol and appropriate RMs were required. Researchers were advised to \nselect the most appropriate reagent depending on the nature of the sample and Hg \nspecies under investigation, and validate their procedure as far as possible. A method \nbased on the thermal evaporation of Hg species from solid samples in combination \n 90\nwith AAS has been described197. The procedure relies on the differences in the \nthermal characteristics of HgCl2, CH3HgCl and HgS. A Hg analyser with a pyrolytic \nattachment was modified by equipping it with a thermocouple for temperature control \nin the dosing unit and a homemade device for moving the unit inside the atomiser. \nSamples were mixed with aluminium oxide (1+4) and 10 mg placed in the dosing \nunit, which was heated at a rate of 1\u00b0Cs-1 under an air flow of 1 L min-1. The total area \nunder the peak of the thermal release profile was considered as the analytical signal \nfor Hg quantification. Detection limits were calculated to be 0.70, 0.35 and 0.20 ng \nfor HgCl2, CH3HgCl and HgS respectively. A range of different extraction methods \nand reagents were compared for the measurement of Hg species in coal347. \nMicrowave-assisted extraction at 90 W for 5 min using TMAH provided the highest \nrecoveries of MeHg and EtHg in their original form.  \n \n4.4 Instrumental analysis \n4.4.1 Atomic absorption and atomic fluorescence spectrometry \nA short review of developments in AAS applied to the analysis of geological materials \nconfirmed that most of these are concerned with analyte preconcentration rather than \ntechnical improvements348. An on-line system containing a mini-column packed with \nAmberlite XAD-4 modified with a Schiff base was developed to preconcentrate Cd, \nCo, Cu, Ni and Pb from aqua regia digests of soils and sediments282. Treatment of the \nacid digests with sodium fluoride and buffering to pH 6 prior to column separation \nprevented the large concentrations of iron present from overloading the capacity of \nthe column. The analytes were eluted from the column with 0.1 M nitric acid directly \ninto a FAAS instrument; the accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated by the \nanalysis of CRMs. A simple FI system, consisting of one peristaltic pump and a \n 91\nsolenoid valve, was successfully employed for the rapid determination of As, Bi and \nSe in sediments by HG-AAS200. To ensure the analytes were in the correct oxidation \nstate, they were pre-reduced off-line using hydroxylamine hydrochloride for Se and a \nmixture of KI and ascorbic acid for As and Bi. Interference from transition metals was \neliminated by the addition of thiourea and EDTA to the sodium borohydride \nreductant. The use of water as carrier streams for the sample and reagent provided a \nstable baseline and better sensitivity. Under optimised conditions, a throughput of 360 \nsamples per hour was achieved.  \n In thermospray flame furnace AAS the sample is introduced into a nickel tube \npositioned on a standard burner head. Although the power of detection obtained with \nthis technique is promising, the low temperature of the flame restricts the technique to \nvolatile elements. To overcome this disadvantage, an on-line derivatisation strategy \nfor improving the sensitivity of Co has been developed349. Lake and marine sediment \nCRMs were digested by a microwave-assisted acid decomposition involving HF. \nAfter adjusting the final solution to pH 3, on-line derivatisation using DDTC as the \ncomplexing agent provided a LOD of 7 \u00b5g L-1 and Co values within the stated limits \nof uncertainty.  \n Chemical vapour generation AFS is widely used for the determination of the \nclassic hydride-forming elements. In a novel development, room temperature ionic \nliquids (RTILs) have been exploited to enhance the chemical vapour generation \n(CVG) of Ag, Au and Cu350. The addition of N-butylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate (a \ntypical RTIL) was shown to improve the CVG of these elements and reduce the \ninterference from various transition elements. It was proposed that the RTIL \nprevented metal nanoparticles, which form the volatile metal species reaching the \n 92\natomiser, from coalescing. The RTIL-enhanced FI-CVG-AFS method was validated \nby the measurement of Ag and Au in ore grade CRMs. \n4.4.2 Atomic emission spectrometry \nMany of the developments in geological applications of ICP-AES are concerned with \nsample preparation and introduction rather than the technique itself, and therefore \nmay be applicable to ICP-MS as well. This is well illustrated in reviews by Linge351 \nand Evans et al.352. Thus Padmasubashini and Murty353 investigated the use of chitin \nfor solid phase extraction and preconcentration of Hf, Mo, W and Zr from geological \nmaterials. After an alkali fusion, ascorbic acid was added to the sample solutions to \ncomplex the iron present, which would otherwise interfere with the preconcentration \nstep.  Powdered chitin was added and the solution left to stand for 2 hours, with \nintermittent stirring, before filtration. The filter paper containing the chitin was ignited \nand the residue digested with a HF-HCl-H2SO4 mixture, evaporated twice and finally \ntaken up in 5% HCl. The method has the advantage of considerably reducing the TDS \narising from the sample matrix and fusion; reported LODs by ICP-AES were 0.13 \u00b5g \ng-1 for Hf, Mo and Zr, and 0.13 \u00b5g g-1 for W. As indicated in Section 4.3.2, nanometer \nmaterial is now finding favour as an absorbent for solid phase extraction. Nanometric \nTiO2 immobilised on silica gel has been used to preconcentrate Pd and Pt from \ngeological samples prior to measurement by ICP-AES354. The samples (peridotite and \nlow platinpalladium ore CRMs from the IGGE) were roasted at 600 \u00b0C for one hour \nprior to a HF-based mixed acid digestion, resulting in a final solution in HCl adjusted \nto pH 7. They were then loaded onto a PTFE micro-column containing immobilised \nnanometer TiO2 and eluated with 3% m\/v thiourea in 1 mol l-1 HNO3, providing an \nenrichment factor of 100. Recoveries of between 92 and 102% were obtained for \n 93\nCRMs containing between 58-570 \u00b5g g-1 Pd and Pt. Major cations and anions had no \nobvious influence on the adsorption of Pd and Pt under the conditions selected. \n Microwave plasma optical emission spectrometry is a minority interest, \nusually performed on home-made instruments. A method for the determination of As \nin environmental samples, based on electrochemical hydride generation for sample \nintroduction into a microwave plasma, has been proposed355. A continuous flow thin \nlayer electrolysis cell with a Pt cathode was used to generate hydrides \nelectrochemically at the surface of the cathode, which was separated from the anode \ncompartment by a cation exchange membrane. A masking agent of L-cysteine or KI-\nascorbic acid (1+1) was required to negate interferences from other transition metals \nsuch as CuII, FeIII and NiII; a coal fly ash CRM was used to validate the procedure. \n \n4.4.3 Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry \nNow that ICP-QMS instrumentation equipped with reliable cell technology is well-\nestablished, it is used on a routine basis to provide comprehensive multielement \nanalysis of geological and environmental materials. This has not discouraged a flurry \nof papers emphasizing the flexibility and power of quadrupole ICP-MS for \ngeochemical analysis; these may provide some pointers for relatively inexperienced \nanalysts356,357,358. The method proposed by de Madinabeitia et al.357 involved fusion \nwith LiBO2 and dissolution in HNO3 with a few drops of HF to stabilise the HFSE. \nThe use of high dilution factors, e.g. 1:6500, together with actions like cone \nconditioning, specific washout solutions and the analysis of drift correction standards \nprovided control on and correction for signal drift during the measurement of major \nand ultratrace elements by ICP-QMS. A similar approach was employed by Niolaeva \nand co-workers358 to determine REEs and HFSEs using a high resolution ICP-MS \n 94\nwith ultrasonic nebulisation to improve the LODs. A method previously applied to the \nanalysis of soil and sediments for REEs plus Ba, Hf, Sc, Th, Y and Zr has been \nrevised so that it is now more widely applicable, particularly to rocks containing \nhighly resistant minerals359. The procedure, which involves an alkaline fusion (NaOH-\nNa2O2) and co-precipitation on iron hydroxides, now includes the addition of a Tm \nspike prior to fusion to provide accurate data even when there is loss of sample during \nanalysis. It is unusual for the boron content of rocks to be routinely measured \nalongside other trace elements, such as the HFSEs, because of the ease with which it \nis volatised under acid conditions. By adding mannitol to the HF-HNO3 acid mixture, \nNagaishi and Ishikawa360 stabilised B as a boron-mannitol complex, together with \nfluoro-HSFE ions such as NbF62- and ZrF62-. Instead of aspirating this solution directly \ninto an ICP-MS instrument with the aid of an HF-resistant sample introduction system \nand ID spikes, as in previous publications, they manipulated the sample through \nstages of evaporation, addition of internal standards and dissolution, while keeping the \ntemperature well below 100 \u00b0C to minimise any loss of B. A five-minute rinse with \n0.015 M HF\/0.15 M HNO3 between samples provided effective washout with \nnegligible damage to the glass components. Fourteen GSJ and 3 USGS rock RMs \nwere analysed in this study to demonstrate that B, Hf, Nb, Ta and Zr could be \ndetermined with satisfactory precision and accuracy without the use of ID.  \n Multi-collector ICP-MS methodology now dominates the literature on isotope \nratio measurements and has spawned a rapid growth in Earth science applications. \nThe breadth and diversity of these applications is reflected in several recent reviews, \nsuch as that by Woodhead361. A special issue of Chemical Geology from the 17th \nGoldschmidt conference in August 2007, highlighted the results presented on stable \nisotopes in high-temperature geochemistry. The preface to this issue gives some \n 95\nbackground to recent developments in this field362. An overview46 (159 refs) of the \nuse of Pb isotopes as tracers of environmental pollution contains a useful summary of \npublished data of the Pb isotope composition, mainly 206Pb\/207Pb, of different \nanthropogenic sources. Aggarwal and co-workers363 provided a couple of case studies \nusing Pb and Sr systems in their review of the application of isotope geochemistry in \nforensic science. Science administrators might well take heed of an article on the \ndevelopment of geochronology in the state of Victoria, Australia364 and the lessons \nlearnt on the most effective way to set up, manage and support complex research \nfacilities. \n The influence of non-spectral matrix effects on the accuracy of Pb isotope \nratio measurements by MC-ICP-MS has been investigated365.  These effects can, in \ntheory, be corrected using external normalisation, but this is only reliable if the \nelement chosen to monitor instrumental mass fractionation responds to the sample \nmatrix in a similar manner to the analyte. Doping experiments demonstrated that non-\nspectral matrix effects resulted in inaccuracies ranging from -150 to +120 ppm per \namu in Pb isotope ratios corrected for mass bias using thallium. Although small, these \nvalues are significant for mantle geochemistry studies. The inaccuracy resulted from \nper mil level variations in the Tl to Pb mass bias ratio induced by the residual matrix \ncomponents, such as aluminium, calcium, iron and magnesium, present after \npurification by anion exchange chromatography. The matrix also caused increased Pb \nand Tl sensitivity. The addition of a common matrix of magnesium to samples and \nstandards was proposed as a viable alternative to thorough purification to reduce or \neliminate non-spectral matrix effects. \n The advantages of ICP-MS, and particularly SF-ICP-MS, for the \ndetermination of Pu isotopes and other transuranic elements has been documented \n 96\n(182 refs)50. This review emphasizes the new and emerging studies of transuranic \nelements in earth and environmental sciences made possible by low cost and widely \navailable ICP-MS data. Liao et al.366 adapted and optimised a published method for \nthe determination of Pu isotopes in marine sediments to the analysis of freshwater \nlake sediments. A strong base anion exchange resin, AG MP-1M, was used to \nseparate the Pu isotopes, with concentrated HBr as the final eluant prior to \nmeasurement by SF-ICP-MS. Because of the relatively simple sample preparation \nprocedure, this method is stated to be cost-effective and well suited to the analysis of \nlarge numbers of sediment samples. However, their mean 240Pu\/239Pu atom ratio of \n0.144 for NIST SRM 4354 (freshwater lake sediment) was lower than those reported \nby other laboratories. The authors suggested that this discrepancy may be because the \nmaterial is isotopically heterogeneous \u2013 it will be interesting to see whether any other \nlaboratory substantiates this claim. A new protocol for the separation and \nmeasurement of Pa, Th and U isotopes in marine sediments by MC-ICP-MS has been \npublished367. Although Th and U were completely dissolved after the first microwave-\nassisted digestion with HNO3, HF and HCl, a second digestion with reverse aqua \nregia (2+1 HNO3\/HCl) on a hot plate was employed to ensure that all Pa had \ndissolved and spike equilibration achieved. The elements of interest were separated \nand then the Pa fraction was purified further using Dowex AG1-X8 anion exchange \nresin, providing good separation of U from Pa; typical 231Pa\/238U ratios measured in \nthe Pa fraction were around 6 x 10-3. A rapid method for determining 241Am in marine \nsediments by isotope dilution SF-ICP-MS combined with extraction chromatography \nhas been developed368. A selective CaF2 co-precipitation procedure followed by \nextraction chromatography separation and purification using Eichrom TRU resin was \nemployed to remove the major elements and preconcentrate 241Am.  A high efficiency \n 97\nsample introduction system combined with SF-ICP-MS enabled the authors to achieve \na detection limit of 0.32 fg g-1, which was better than that by alpha spectrometry, and \nallowed depth profiles of 241Am in sediment cores to be studied. \nInvestigations into the systematics of so-called \u201cnon traditional\u201d stable \nisotopes continue to flourish. Whilst a high degree of precision permits a range of \ngeological questions to be addressed, confirming the accuracy of the data remains a \nchallenge, as bias can easily be introduced during chemical preparation and analysis. \nFor this reason, the standard addition method was used to verify the accuracy and \nprecision of Mg and Ca isotope data by MC-ICP-MS369. Although good agreement \nwith published values was obtained for the analysis of seawater, there were \ndiscrepancies between the estimates of \u03b426Mg in silicate material and those reported \npreviously for the same samples, possibly through an artefact induced by the chemical \npurification of Mg prior to analysis.  \n A new procedure developed for the determination of Cr isotope ratios in \ngeological samples by MC-ICP-MS370 employed a two column separation system of \nanion and cation exchange resins to avoid any potential matrix effect and isobaric \ninterferences, while maintaining high recovery of Cr. Measurement precisions (2s) of \n110, 60 and 100 ppm for 50Cr\/52Cr, 53Cr\/52Cr and 54Cr\/52Cr respectively were reported. \nInexplicably, for some geological matrices, this methodology was not effective in \nreducing the concentrations of iron and titanium  below 2% relative to the Cr \nconcentrations in the eluate. As a result, only 53Cr\/52Cr could be measured in such \nsamples. Significant differences in Cr isotope ratios were found between basic \nigneous rocks and organic-rich shale, as well as between that shale and its natural \ncombustion products. \n 98\n The determination of the platinum group elements (PGEs) in geological \nsamples presents a variety of problems during both their preparation and measurement \nby ICP-MS. These are compounded by their low natural abundances and \nheterogeneous distribution. A procedure developed by Palesskii et al.371 employed \nisotope dilution to improve the accuracy of PGE measurements. Samples were spiked \nwith 191Ir, 190Os, 106Pd, 194Pt, 185Re and 99Ru before microwave digestion with a 1+3 \nmixture of HCl and HNO3. The analytes were separated from the matrix by cation \nexchange on BioRad AG 50Wx8 resin; the eluant obtained was suitable for direct \nanalysis by an SF-ICP-MS instrument fitted with an ultrasonic nebuliser. To reduce \nmemory effects to a minimum, wash solution was introduced for up to 10 minutes \nbetween samples. Detection limits ranged from 0.005 ng g-1 to 0.2 ng g-1 for Pd. \nIsotope dilution was also employed by Rodr\u00edguez-Castrill\u00f3n and colleagues40 to \ndetermine Pt in environmental samples containing comparatively high levels of \nhafnium without any chemical separation. Their method was based on calculating the \ncontribution of hafnium oxide as an independent factor in the observed isotope pattern \nof Pt in a sample spiked with enriched 194Pt. The procedure required the measurement \nof three Pt isotope ratios, which was performed on a quadrupole ICP-MS instrument. \nIt was possible to correct for mass bias by an internal procedure, in which the \nregression variance was minimised, because the mass bias factor of hafnium oxide \nwas virtually the same as that for Pt. \n \n4.4.4 Other mass spectrometric techniques  \nThermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) is still considered to be the technique \nof choice for isotopic measurements where the amount of sample is limited and small \namounts of the element of interest are available. An example is the determination of \n 99\nSr isotope ratios in individual melt inclusions372. Micro-milling was preferred over \nlaser ablation sampling, and the micro Sr separation chemistry using Eichrom Sr spec \nresin was modified for application to samples containing sub-ng amounts of Sr. All \npotential contributions to the blank were assessed; total procedural blanks were 5.4 \u00b1 \n0.3 pg Sr and 1.9 \u00b1 0.7 pg Rb. By applying blank corrections, the Sr isotope \ncomposition could be determined to an accuracy of better than 400 ppm on samples as \nsmall as 25 pg Sr. Harvey and Baxter373 developed an improved TIMS method for \nhigh precision Nd isotope analysis of samples containing small amounts (1-10 ng) of \nNd. Analysing Nd isotopes as NdO+ is a well known technique, often involving an \noxygen bleed and\/or silica gel. In this study, samples were loaded with a tantalum \noxide phosphoric acid slurry, which provided the oxygen source. With external \nreproducibilities of 13-21 ppm (2\u03c3 RSD) and an internal precision of less than 10 ppm \n(2\u03c3 RSD), when combined with successful column chemistry, this method has the \npotential to expand the range of materials suitable for high precision Nd isotope \nmeasurements.  Single crystal chemical abrasion ID TIMS has been used for U-Pb \ndating of zircon and rutile from the PGE-rich Merensky reef to provide a precise age \nof crystallisation for the Bushveld Complex374. During an investigation of Ni isotopic \nanomalies in iron meteorites and chondrites, Chen and co-workers375 concluded that \nTIMS was the preferred analytical technique because of the numerous atomic and \nmolecular mass interferences present in the determination of Ni by MC-ICP-MS. \nImproved analytical procedures resulted in a Ni+ ionisation efficiency of 1\u2030 and \nchemical separations reduced mass interferences to 1 ppm. Consequently, no \ninterference corrections were necessary for the isotopes measured. Mass bias was \ncorrected using 62Ni\/58Ni. When they applied this method to some meteorites analysed \nby other workers, they could not find any evidence to support previous descriptions of \n 100\nNi isotopic anomalies by workers using MC-ICP-MS. They concluded that complex \nastrophysical scenarios were not required to account for the very peculiar Ni isotope \nanomalies reported elsewhere.  \n An authoritative review (21 refs)376 of advances in secondary ion mass \nspectrometry (SIMS or ion probe) during 2006-2007, highlighted significant \ndevelopments in instrumentation, analytical methodology and the characterisation of \nnew RMs. By the end of this period, total sampling masses down to the 10 fg range, \nspatial resolutions of better than 100 nm and uncertainties on major element isotope \nratios of better than \u00b1 0.2\u2030 were being reported. This paper also discusses some \nresearch results that were only possible because of the unique capabilities of SIMS. \n Historical perspectives are often valuable to those new to a field. The story \nof the development of the Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe (SHRIMP), the \nfirst ion microprobe dedicated to geological isotopic analysis, is one such example377. \nThe SHRIMP has often been regarded as an instrument solely used for U-Pb \ngeochronology, whereas its capabilities are far more extensive. Advances in SHRIMP \ninstrumentation include multiple collection and negative ion measurement for stable \nisotope analysis, as well as the construction of different versions for specific \napplications.  \n Technical improvements to the SHRIMP II enabled Ickert and co-\nworkers378 to determine the in situ oxygen isotopic composition of insulating materials \nsuch as silicates, carbonate, phosphates and oxides, on a scale of 25 \u00b5m with better \nthan 0.4\u2030 precision and accuracy at 95% confidence limits. Key aspects of this \nachievement included the introduction of a Cs+ source, a multiple collector, charge \nneutralisation using an oblique-incidence electron gun, Helmholtz coils and new \nsample mounts that reduce geometry effects. In another study379, oxygen isotopes in a \n 101\nlarge lunar zircon were measured using a Cameca IMS1270 ion microprobe equipped \nwith multicollectors. The authors demonstrated that the accuracy of such high \nprecision (typically <0.2\u2030, 1\u03c3) analyses may be compromised by a combination of \nexcessive surface relief and orientation factors. Bias could be avoided by locating the \nsample and standard close to each other. Where this was not possible, orientation \nalong the x-axis of the mount was found to provide better accuracy. \n Li et al.380 developed a method of measuring 207Pb\/206Pb ratios in young \nzircons using a large radius magnetic sector MC Cameca IMS-1280 SIMS instrument. \nThrough a combination of multicollector mode, a NMR magnet controller and oxygen \nflooding techniques, an analytical precision of 0.2% or better was achieved without \nexternal standardisation. The precision of the zircon Pb\u2013Pb determinations depended \nchiefly on the radiogenic Pb content; uncertainties in the 207Pb\/206Pb ratios were very \nclose to those expected from counting statistics. \n The performance of the Cameca NanoSIMS 50 ion probe has been assessed \nfor U-Pb dating of zircon with a 15 \u00b5m spatial resolution381. A multicrystal zircon \nstandard, QGNG from South Australia with a U-Pb age of 1842 Ma, was used as a \nreference for Pb+\/UO+ \u2013 UO2+\/UO+ calibration in multicollector mode. On the basis of \na positive correlation between these ratios, the 206Pb\/238U ratios of the samples were \ndetermined. The 207Pb\/206Pb ratios were measured by magnetic scanning in single \ncollector mode. The 206Pb\u2013238U ages obtained for standard zircons 91500 and SL13 \nagreed well with published ages within experimental error; 207Pb\u2013206Pb ages were also \ncomparable, although the experimental error was large. It has also been demonstrated \nthat the Cameca NanoSIMS 50 ion probe is able to measure 13C\/12C ratios in early \nPrecambrian organic matter with permil precision382. A Cs+ primary beam was \nrastered over a 5 x 5 \u00b5m area in less than 30 minutes; grains smaller than 5 \u00b5m could \n 102\nbe analysed if their surrounding matrix did not contain carbon. The procedures \nadopted are not universally applicable because of the matrix dependence of the C- \nsecondary yields but many of the experimental observations would apply to any \norganic sample. \n A short technical note383 describes a simple technique for making a \ngermanium-bismuth glass designed specifically for performing coarse calibrations of \nSIMS instruments. The Ge-Bi glass was doped with five trace elements selected to \nanchor specific points on the mass spectrum. While not suitable for the quantification \nof geological materials, its use greatly simplified the switch from low to high mass \nmeasurements. \n Two large pegmatitic crystals of sodic pyroxene and sodic amphibole have \nbeen found to be suitable RMs for in situ Li isotope determinations by SIMS384. \nAlthough the crystals were isotopically homogeneous within the precision of the \nmethods applied, there was a significant difference between the SIMS data and those \nobtained on micro-drilled material analysed by MC-ICP-MS. This indicated the \npresence of significant matrix effects in the SIMS determinations of Li isotopes in \namphibole and pyroxene relative to the basalt glasses used for calibration. It was \nproposed that these two crystals serve as RMs to ensure the accuracy of Li isotope \nratios measured by SIMS. \n The capabilities and limitations of ToF-SIMS as a tool in organic \ngeochemical research have been evaluated385. Although at an early stage, examples of \nits potential application in this field are: (i) the identification of biomarkers in oil-\nbearing fluid inclusions; and (ii) the identification of specific lipid biomarkers that \nmight be assigned to particular organisms involved in biomineralisation. Important \naspects of this research were the development of appropriate sample preparation \n 103\nprotocols, measurement of reference spectra from pure substances as an aid to \nspectrum interpretation, and validation of the ToF-SIMS results against established \nknowledge and methods. \n With the increasing use of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) in \ngeoscientific research, more precise data for 10Be and 36Cl will be required \nmeasurements at the 10-14 level. Merchel et al.386 outlined the special precautions that \nshould be taken during sample preparation to ensure that low blank values are \nobtained consistently when working at this level. Dating surface rocks using \ncosmogenic 10Be can be problematical in the presence of contaminant 10Be produced \nin the Earth\u2019s atmosphere387. While quartz is relatively easily cleaned by acid \nleaching, carbonates are more difficult. Leaching experiments performed on different \ngrain size fractions showed that atmospheric 10Be resided in the clay fraction and that \npartial leaching procedures failed to release 10Be because of instant reabsorption on \nthe grain surfaces387. As a result, 10Be measurements in carbonates should be carried \nout on samples that do not contain clay minerals. Balco and Rovey388 have described \nan improved procedure for dating buried paleosols using measurements of cosmic \n26Al and 10Be in quartz grains. The procedure involves measuring 26Al and 10Be at \nmultiple depths in the paleosol and calculating its age of burial from the resulting \nisochron. The only critical assumption required by this method is that the inherited \n26Al and 10Be in the paleosol parent material are well-mixed vertically. Laser \ndecomposition has been successfully employed to generate radiocarbon measurements \nfrom marine aragonite389. A Nd-YAG laser operating at 213 nm was used to produce \nCO2 by thermal decomposition of the aragonite. Agreement between 14C data \nobtained by laser decomposition AMS and conventional acid digestion prior to AMS, \nindicated that fractionation was not a concern. This is in contrast to the significant \n 104\nfractionation that has been observed during stable isotope determinations of C and O \nof different carbonate minerals following laser decomposition. These results \nillustrated the potential promise for coupling laser decomposition to an AMS system \nthat measures CO2 directly.  \n4.4.5    X-ray techniques  \nThe annual Update on XRFS76 is a comprehensive review of recent developments in \nall aspects of XRF (434 refs). The section on geological applications confirms that \nXRFS often supplies the routine major and trace element data as part of a multi-\ntechnique approach in geochemical studies. \n  Methods of sample preparation continue to evolve. Two methods of \ncorrecting for mineralogical effects in the measurement of pressed powders pellets by \nWD-XRF were evaluated390. The first involved checking the 2\u03b8 angle for each sample \nbefore the actual measurement and correcting for any shift in the peak; an \nimprovement in the calibration obtained with 27 Chinese geological CRMs was \ndemonstrated. In the second method, the peak intensity was replaced by the peak area  \nto correct for any distortion of the peak shape; this required too much scanning time to \nbe practicable. Zhang et al.391 proposed another approach in which the samples were \ndigested with aqua regia before mixing the sample solution with agaron gel. After \nboiling, a quasi-solid gel was formed on cooling to room temperature. This technique \nwas successfully applied to the determination of Fe, Pb and Zn in concentrates of lead \nand zinc ores. Information from XRD can be crucial to the successful analysis of \nsome difficult samples, such as slags and refractory materials, by confirming the \nmineralogical phases present and thus influencing the method of sample \npreparation392. Fused beads, while minimising any mineralogical effects, may result in \nloss of volatile elements like sulphur. To overcome this difficulty, Gazulla and co-\n 105\nworkers393 added a known quantity of barium, which combined with the S in the \nsample to form BaSO4 and thus suppressed the loss of S during the fusion process. An \nunusual procedure for determining Re by XRF in ores containing gold relied on the \nadsorption of perrhenate ions on activated charcoal after sample dissolution394. Not \nonly did the preconcentration enhance the sensitivity but it allowed samples of \ndiffering compositions to be presented for analysis in a uniform matrix. \n Although bench top ED-XRF instruments have been accepted for routine \nquality control in industrial settings, they still need to establish their credentials in \ngeochemical studies for a wide range of elements. A recent study of the determination \nof major and trace elements in soils and sediments provides some figures of merit for \na modern bench top model247. The samples were prepared as pressed powders, \nwithout a binder, and a spinner system in the spectrometer was employed to reduce \nany errors due to sample heterogeneity. After careful selection of measurement \nparameters, the precision of analysis was better than 0.5% for Fe, K, Mn and Ti and \nbetter than 5% for all other elements, with a minimum LOD of between 1 and 2 ppm \nfor most elements. \n On-line analysis of sediment cores by XRF core scanners has become \nincreasingly popular because near-continuous records of element distributions can be \nobtained non-destructively with a minimum of analytical effort. However, one major \ndisadvantage compared to conventional geochemical analysis is the problem of \nconverting the output into elemental concentrations. Weltje and Tjalllingii395 have \nproposed a log ratio calibration model, derived from a combination of XRFS theory, \nprinciples of compositional data analysis and empirical experience. The successful \ncalibration of XRF core scanners by this technique would appear to represent a major \nadvance in their use. The authors urge practitioners to abandon the general practice of \n 106\nreporting the results from core scanners as raw intensities or peak integrals and adopt \nlog ratios as the default format. \n
