An important quantity emerging from the definition of the\ncylinder partition function for these field theories is the g-function, the \u2018ground-state\ndegeneracy\u2019 or \u2018boundary entropy\u2019, which for models critical in the bulk was introduced\nsome years ago by Affleck and Ludwig [7]. While many interesting questions remain\nin these cases [8, 9], in this paper we shall deal with the further issues which arise for\noff-critical, massive, systems.\nThe g-function for massive field theories can be defined as follows [10, 11, 12, 13].\nThere are two possible Hamiltonian descriptions of the cylinder partition function. In\nthe so-called L-channel representation the ro\u02c6le of time is taken by L, the circumference\nof the circle:\nZ\u03b1\u03b2 = TrH(\u03b1,\u03b2)e\n\u2212LHstrip\u03b1\u03b2 (M,R) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\ne\u2212LE\nstrip\nn (M,R) . (1.1)\nIn this formula, Hstrip\u03b1\u03b2 propagates states in H(\u03b1,\u03b2), the Hilbert space for an interval\nof length R with boundary conditions \u03b1 and \u03b2 imposed at the two ends, Estripn \u2208\nspec(Hstrip\u03b1\u03b2 ) , and M is the mass of the lightest particle in the theory. In the R-channel\nrepresentation the ro\u02c6le of time is instead taken by R, the length of the cylinder:\nZ\u03b1\u03b2 = \u3008\u03b1| e\u2212RHcirc(M,L) |\u03b2 \u3009 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nG(n)\u03b1 (l)G(n)\u03b2 (l) e\u2212RE\ncirc\nn (M,L), (l =ML) (1.2)\nwhere Ecircn \u2208 spec(Hcirc) and\nG(n)\u03b1 (l) = \u3008\u03b1|\u03c8n \u3009\u3008\u03c8n|\u03c8n \u30091\/2 . (1.3)\nIn equation (1.2), the boundary states |\u03b1\u3009, |\u03b2\u3009 and the eigenbasis {|\u03c8n\u3009} of the Hamil-\ntonian Hcirc have been used. These are defined on a circle of circumference L and\npropagate along the \u2018time\u2019 direction R. At large l, the function lnG(0)\u03b1 (l) grows linearly:\nlnG(0)\u03b1 (l) \u223c \u2212f\u03b1L , (1.4)\nwhere the constant f\u03b1 contributes to the constant (boundary) part of the ground-state\nenergy on the strip (see eq. (A.5)). The standard g-function is then defined as\nln g\u03b1(l) = lnG(0)\u03b1 (l) + f\u03b1L . (1.5)\nIn theories with only massive excitations in the bulk, ln g\u03b1(l) tends exponentially to\nzero at large l.\n1\nRL\n(space)\n(time)\n\u03b1 \u03b2\nFigure 1: The L-channel decomposition; states |\u03c7n\u3009 live on the dotted line segment\nalong the cylinder.\nR\n(time)\nL\n(space)\n\u03b1 \u03b2\nFigure 2: The R-channel decomposition; states |\u03c8n\u3009 live on the dotted circle around\nthe cylinder.\nThe two decompositions are illustrated in figures 1 and 2.\nThe equality of (1.1) and (1.2) results in the following important identity:\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\ne\u2212LE\nstrip\nn (M,R) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nG(n)\u03b1 (l)G(n)\u03b2 (l) e\u2212RE\ncirc\nn (M,L). (1.6)\nThe purpose of this paper is to develop an exact expression for the ground-state function\nlnG(0)\u03b1 (l) through the large-R limit of (1.6), with boundary conditions \u03b2 = \u03b1. As it\nstands, the fact that Ecirc0 (M,L) is negative makes the RHS of (1.6) diverge as R\u2192\u221e;\nhowever, rearranging gives\n2 ln G(0)\u03b1 (l) = REcirc0 (M,L)\u2212 LEstrip0 (M,R) (1.7)\n+ ln\n(\n1 +\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\ne\u2212L(E\nstrip\nn (M,R)\u2212E\nstrip\n0 (M,R))\n)\n+O(e\u2212R(E\ncirc\n1 \u2212E\ncirc\n0 )) .\nWe shall restrict our attention to massive theories with non-degenerate ground state\non the plane. For these models the non-zero mass gap gives the final term the leading\nbehaviour\nO(e\u2212R(E\ncirc\n1 (M,L)\u2212E\ncirc\n0 (M,L))) \u223c O(e\u2212RM ) (1.8)\n2\nin the domain R\u226b L\u226b 0. In this same domain, Estrip0 (M,R) tends to its limiting form\nas\nEstrip0 (M,R) = EM2R+ 2f\u03b1 +O(e\u2212RM ) (1.9)\nwhere E and f\u03b1 are the extensive bulk and boundary free energies, as in (A.5). These\nconstraints are crucial for the validity of the perturbative treatment to be introduced\nin the following sections: the higher corrections have a clear dependence on R and do\nnot contribute to the g-function. Discarding these exponentially-suppressed terms and\nusing the definition (1.5), we finally obtain\n2 ln g(0)\u03b1 (l) \u223c R\n(\nEcirc0 (M,L)\u2212 EM2L\n)\n+ ln\n(\n1 +\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\ne\u2212L(E\nstrip\nn (M,R)\u2212E\nstrip\n0 (M,R))\n)\n.\n(1.10)\nHaving taken R to be large, the cluster expansion involves letting L tend to infinity\nas well, so that an expansion of the RHS of (1.10) can be developed in terms of one-,\ntwo- and so on particle contributions, which themselves can be consistently estimated\nusing the Bethe-ansatz approximated levels (A.6), (A.7). Note that this differs from the\nstrategy adopted in [10], where a saddle-point evaluation of the dominant contributions\nat finite L was made instead.\nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows. In section 2 the cluster method is\nexemplified by studying the free fermion theory associated to the thermally-perturbed\nIsing model. The resulting integral expression for ln g\u03b1(l) turns out to be in full agree-\nment with previous results of [10, 11]. In section 3 two previous proposals [10, 14]\nfor ln g\u03b1(l) are described and in section 4 the scattering data for the scaling Lee-Yang\nmodel, our working interactive example, are summarised. The ultraviolet result ob-\ntained from the conformal perturbation theory and the boundary truncated conformal\nspace approximation (BTCSA) [12, 13, 9] is compared with infrared numerical results\nfrom the Bethe Ansatz, and the equivalence between the two functions is confirmed by\na large overlap at intermediate scales.\nThis agreement motivates the search for an exact analytic expression. This is the\nmain objective of sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 where the large strip-width (R \u2192 \u221e) limit\nis explicitly taken and sums over the quantum numbers are transformed into integrals\nin rapidity variables. This analysis leads to the final exact expansion for ln g\u03b1(l) given\nin equation (5.24). This and its generalization (5.30) constitute the main results of the\npaper. In section 5.3 we also briefly comment on the similarity between our results and\none recently obtained by Woynarovich in [15]. Section 6 contains our conclusions. Fi-\nnally, in Appendix A we summarise the main equations used to develop our programme:\nthe thermodynamic Bethe ansatz [16] and the Bethe quantisation conditions. In Ap-\npendix B the reflection factors for the Ising model are recalled and explicit expressions\nfor the boundary entropy for free-free and fixed-fixed conditions are presented.\n3\n2 A simple example: the Ising model\nWe start with the study of the free Majorana fermion theory corresponding to the\nthermally-perturbed Ising model on a strip. The partition function is (cf. [11]) \u2217 :\nZ\u03b1\u03b1 = e\n\u2212LEstrip0 (M,R)\n\u220f\nj>0\n(\n1 + e\u2212l cosh \u03b8j\n)\n, (l =ML) , (2.1)\nor\nlnZ\u03b1\u03b1 = \u2212LEstrip0 (M,R) +\n\u2211\nj>0\nln(1 + e\u2212l cosh \u03b8j )\n= \u2212LEstrip0 (M,R) +\n1\n2\n\u221e\u2211\nj=\u2212\u221e\nln(1 + e\u2212l cosh \u03b8j )\u2212 1\n2\nln(1 + e\u2212l) . (2.2)\nDue to the singular behaviour for the Ising model of the bulk and linear terms E and f\u03b1\ndefined in (A.2) and (A.5) below, it is convenient, exceptionally for this case, to work\nwith subtracted energies tending exponentially to zero at large scales:\nEstrip0 (M,R)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nR\u226b1\n\u223c 0 (2.3)\nand consistently to set\nEcirc0 (M,L) = \u2212\n\u222b\nR\nd\u03b8\n2\u03c0\nM cosh \u03b8 ln (1 + e\u2212l cosh \u03b8) (2.4)\n(cf. (A.2)). Starting from the quantization condition\nr sinh \u03b8j \u2212 i lnR\u03b1(\u03b8j) = \u03c0j , (r =MR) (2.5)\nwith integer j and R\u03b1(\u03b8j) as defined in (B.1), writing equation (2.5) with j \u2192 j+1 and\nsubtracting (2.5) from the result, we find in the large R limit\n\u2206\u03b8j\n\u03c0\n(\nr cosh(\u03b8j)\u2212 i d\nd\u03b8\nlnR\u03b1(\u03b8j)\n)\n+O((\u2206\u03b8j)\n2) = 1 . (2.6)\nSubstituting this into (2.2),\nlnZ\u03b1\u03b1 \u223c 1\n2\n\u222b\nR\nd\u03b8\n( r\n\u03c0\ncosh(\u03b8) + \u03c6\u03b1(\u03b8)\u2212 \u03b4(\u03b8)\n)\nln(1 + e\u2212l cosh \u03b8) , (2.7)\nwhere \u03c6\u03b1(\u03b8) is given in (B.2). In the latter equation we recognize a part corresponding\nto REcirc0 (M,L), and, considering also (2.3), we arrive at the exact result\n2 ln g\u03b1(l) = lim\nR\u2192\u221e\n(lnZ\u03b1\u03b1(L,R)+RE\ncirc\n0 (M,L)) =\n1\n2\n\u222b\nR\nd\u03b8 (\u03c6\u03b1(\u03b8)\u2212 \u03b4(\u03b8)) ln(1+e\u2212l cosh \u03b8) .\n(2.8)\n\u2217Notice that the zero momentum (\u03b8j = 0\u2194 j = 0) particle state is forbidden.\n4\nThis coincides with the result found in [10, 11] using a different technique. The match\nconfirms the correctness of our method, at least in this case, and motivates its study in\nmore complicated models.\nIn figures 3 and 4 the integration of (2.8) for free-free and fixed-fixed boundary\nconditions, corresponding to k = 1 and k = \u2212\u221e in (B.1) and (B.2)\u2020, is compared with\nnumerical results obtained by estimating the large-R partition function (2.1) using the\nBethe ansatz quantized energy levels (2.5) directly, and then extracting the boundary\nentropy through the relation\n2 ln g\u03b1(l) \u223c ( lnZ\u03b1\u03b1(L,R) +REcirc0 (M,L))\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nr\u226b1\n.

In figures 5\nand 6 we test this more general way to estimate a g-function. A similar idea was first\napplied to the scaling Lee-Yang model in [12, 13]; however in that case the energy levels\nwere estimated using the BTCSA method [12], rather than the Bethe ansatz.\n\u2020By studying the monodromies of the integral (2.8), we have also found more explicit expressions for\nln gfixed(l) and ln gfree(l); these are given in Appendix B.\n5\n\u22121.5 \u22121 \u22120.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.35\n\u22120.3\n\u22120.25\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.15\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.05\n0\n0.05\n\u22122.5 \u22122 \u22121.5 \u22121 \u22120.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2\n\u22121.5\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\nFigure 5: 2 ln gfixed vs. ln(l) for Ising with\nfixed boundary conditions.

(3.3)\n6\n(Note, the normalisations of \u03c6\n(a)\n\u03b1 (\u03b8) and \u03c6ab(\u03b8) differ from those in [13, 14] by factors\nof \u03c0 and 2\u03c0 respectively. This change is merely to simplify some later formulae.)\nHowever, the detailed analysis of [13] showed that, for non-zero values of the lightest\nbulk mass M , the resulting l-dependence was incorrect, both in the total change in\ng\u03b1(l) between UV and IR, and in the behaviour of the small-l series expansion. On the\nother hand, the predictions of (3.1) and (3.2) for dependence of g\u03b1(l) on the boundary\nparameters at fixed l, and also for the ratios of g-functions g\u03b1(l)\/g\u03b2(l) , were in very\ngood agreement with conformal perturbation theory and the BTCSA. This suggested\nthat the formulae should be modified by some boundary condition independent extra\nterms, but provided little clue as to what those extra terms should be.\nSubsequently, it was proposed in [14] that (3.2) should be replaced by\n\u0398a(\u03b8) =\n(\n\u03c6(a)\u03b1 (\u03b8) \u2212 2\u03c6aa(2\u03b8) \u2212 \u03c6aa(\u03b8)\n)\n. (3.4)\nHowever, using results tabulated in [13] it can be checked that this modification does\nnot cure the problems arising in the bulk-massive case.\n4 The scaling Lee-Yang model\nThe spectrum in the bulk scaling Lee-Yang theory consists of a single particle species,\nwith two-particle bulk scattering amplitude [17, 18]\nS(\u03b8) = \u2212(1)(2) , (x) = sinh\n(\n\u03b8\n2 +\nipix\n6\n)\nsinh\n(\n\u03b8\n2 \u2212 ipix6\n) . (4.1)\nWhen a boundary is present, two different types of boundary conditions arise, which\nwere labelled 1 and \u03a6(h) in [12]. The corresponding reflection factors are\nR\u03a6(h)(\u03b8) = Rb(\u03b8) , R1 (\u03b8) = R0(\u03b8) , (4.2)\nwhere\nh \u223c \u2212|hc| sin((b+ .5)\u03c0\/5)M6\/5 , hc = \u22120.6852899 . . .

(4.4)\nWe first use the Bethe ansatz equation together with (1.7) to obtain the g-function up to\nsix-particle contributions. The results are shown in figure 7 for the boundary condition\n1 , and are compared with the ultraviolet expansion obtained from (boundary) conformal\nperturbation theory and the BTCSA [13]:\n2 ln g1 (l) =\n1\n2\nln\n(\u221a\n5\u2212 1\n2\n\u221a\n5\n)\n+ 2\nf1\nM\nl + 2\n4\u2211\nn=1\ndn\n(\nl\n\u03ba\n)12\n5\nn\n+O(l12) , (4.5)\n7\nwhere f1 =\n1\n4(\n\u221a\n3\u2212 1)M , d1 \u2248 \u22120.25312, d2 \u2248 0.0775, d3 \u2248 \u22120.0360, d4 \u2248 0.0195, and\n\u03ba \u2248 2.6429.\n\u22124 \u22123 \u22122 \u22121 0 1\n\u22121\n\u22120.8\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.2\n0\nFigure 7: 2 ln g1 vs. ln(l) with (1 , 1 ) boundary conditions. The dotted line is the 4\nth\norder result of [13] and the solid lines are BA results with r = 8. The solid lines, from the\nbottom, represent the 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 6 particle contributions respectively. The maximum\nquantum number used was 80 (57 for the 6-particle contribution).\nAs can be seen from the figure, the results from the Bethe ansatz and from perturbed\nconformal field theory overlap over a significant range of scales. This supports our\nhypothesis that the two approaches are describing the same function g1 (l), expanded\nabout either the IR or the UV.\n5 Infrared expansion for the Lee-Yang model\nThe purpose of this section is to develop an analytic technique to check the earlier\nproposals described in section 3 and at the same time to give hints about the appropriate\nmodifications. The idea, successfully applied above to the Ising model, is to start from\nthe Bethe ansatz and to set up a cluster expansion by transforming the sums into\nintegrals as R\u2192\u221e. The method is quite powerful, and already at first order it confirms\nthe questions raised in [13] about the proposals described in section 3. To simplify the\ndiscussion we shall only treat the (1 , 1 ) boundary conditions directly. However, this\nrestriction is of no real significance since the results in [4, 13, 19] show that\nG(0)\u03a6(h)(l) = Y\n(\ni\u03c0\nb+ 3\n6\n)\nG(0)1 (l) , Y (\u03b8) = e\n\u03b5(\u03b8) , (5.1)\nwhere \u03b5(\u03b8) is the solution of the ground state TBA equation with periodic boundary\nconditions.\n8\n5.1 The one particle contribution\nWe start from the large-R equation (1.10), truncated at the one-particle level:\n2 ln g1 \u223c R\n(\nEcirc0 (M,L)\u2212 EM2L\n)\n+ ln\n(\n1 +\n\u2211\nn1>0\ne\u2212l cosh \u03b81(n1) + . . .\n)\n, (5.2)\nwhere the one-particle Bethe ansatz essentially coincides with that for a free particle,\nr sinh \u03b81 \u2212 i lnR1 (\u03b81) = \u03c0n1 , (5.3)\nwith integer n1. Performing the continuous limit as in section 2 we find\nP1 =\n\u2211\nn1>0\ne\u2212l cosh \u03b81 =\n1\n2\n( \u221e\u2211\nn1=\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212l cosh \u03b81 \u2212 e\u2212l\n)\n\u2212\u2192 1\n2\n\u222b\nR\nd\u03b8 (J (1)(\u03b8)\u2212 \u03b4(\u03b8)) e\u2212l cosh \u03b8\n(5.4)\nwhere the Jacobian for the change of variable n1 \u2192 \u03b81 \u2261 \u03b8 is\nJ (1)(\u03b8) =\nr\n\u03c0\ncosh \u03b8 + \u03c61 (\u03b8) . (5.5)\nThe cosh term cancels the leading part of the term linear in R on the RHS of (5.2),\nleaving the first contribution to ln g1 as\n2 ln g1 =\n1\n2\n\u222b\nR\nd\u03b8 (\u03c61 (\u03b8)\u2212 \u03b4(\u03b8)) e\u2212l cosh \u03b8 + . . . . (5.6)\nComparing this result with the proposals of section 3, we conclude that both are incor-\nrect: in particular no \u03c6(2\u03b8) or \u03c6(\u03b8) terms are involved in the leading large l asymptotic.\nNext, we want to use this result to gain a hint as to how the earlier proposals should\nbe modified. However, the task to totally or even partially re-sum the cluster expansion\ndirectly is, in principle, very hard. Our work is driven by the extra assumption that\nthe final result should depend, just like the earlier \u2018partially correct\u2019 proposals (3.2)\nand (3.4), on the bare single-particle energies only through the TBA pseudoenergies\n\u03b5(\u03b8). As will be reported in more detail below, the consistency of this assumption was\nchecked carefully up to four particles and confirmed, by a more superficial inspection,\nto all orders.\nThe attempt to find an exact expression for ln g1 , therefore, naturally starts from\nln g1 = [ln g1 ]\n(1)\nD + . . . (5.7)\nwhere we have defined the \u2018dressed\u2019 version of (5.6) to be\n2[ln g1 ]\n(1)\nD =\n1\n2\n\u222b\nR\nd\u03b8 (\u03c61 (\u03b8)\u2212 \u03b4(\u03b8)) ln(1 + e\u2212\u03b5(\u03b8)).

The top dotted line is the \u2018exact\u2019 result obtained by combining\nthe CFT and BA results from figure 7. The solid lines are obtained from (5.6) (bottom\nline) and (5.7) (middle line).\nNotice now that [ln g1 ]\n(1)\nD also contains n(> 1)-particle contributions. To see this at\nsecond order, we expand\nln(1 + e\u2212\u03b5(\u03b8)) as e\u2212\u03b5(\u03b8) \u2212 e\n\u22122\u03b5(\u03b8)\n2\n+ . . . , (5.9)\nand use the exponential of equation (A.1) expanded in terms of the bare particle energy\ne(\u03b8) =M cosh \u03b8\ne\u2212\u03b5(\u03b8) = e\u2212l cosh \u03b8\n(\n1 +\n\u222b\nR\nd\u03b8\u2032\u03c6(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u2032)e\u2212l cosh \u03b8\u2032\n)\n+ . . .

(5.17)\nThe up-to second order 2 ln g1 contains seven distinct contributions, the first five co-\ninciding with those written explicitly on the RHS of (5.11) and corresponding to the\nup-to-two particle expansion of 2[ln g1 ]\n(1)\nD . (This confirms the correctness of the dressed\nformulae (5.7, 5.8) up to this point).

(5.20)\n5.3 The exact result\nTo go further in the expansion becomes increasingly difficult, due to higher number of\nJacobians and the huge number of terms contributing to a single Jacobian. However we\nmanaged to complete the analysis up to four particles and to perform a more superficial\ninspection at higher orders. The following results were deduced: at each order there is\nalways a new contribution of the form\nCn =\n1\nn\n\u222b\nRn\nd\u03b81 . . . d\u03b8n \u03c6(\u03b81 + \u03b82)\u03c6(\u03b82 \u2212 \u03b83) . . . \u03c6(\u03b8n \u2212 \u03b81)e\u2212l cosh \u03b81 . . . e\u2212l cosh \u03b8n , (5.21)\nwhen the lower order terms C2, . . . , Cn\u22121 are corrected according to the rule\ne\u2212l cosh \u03b8 \u2192 1\n1 + e\u03b5(\u03b8)\n. (5.22)\n12\nAn additional term contains a single integration over the function \u03c6(2\u03b8), as already\nseen in (5.18) and (5.20). To treat these terms is trickier, but after a few attempts we\nconvinced ourselves that the correct procedure is always to replace l cosh \u03b8 with \u03b5(\u03b8),\nand then to resum, as:\u222b\nR\nd\u03b8 \u03c6(2\u03b8)\n(\n\u22121\n2\ne\u22122l cosh \u03b8 + . . .\n)\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u222b\nR\nd\u03b8 \u03c6(2\u03b8)\n(\nln(1 + e\u2212\u03b5(\u03b8))\u2212 1\n1 + e\u03b5(\u03b8)\n)\n.

As mentioned at the end of section 3, this was only to be expected\ngiven the results of [13], but it is nevertheless satisfying that the already-verified portions\nof the earlier results have been recovered by this rather different route.\nIn figure 9 the result from equation (5.24) is compared with the \u2018exact\u2019 result ob-\ntained in section 4 by combining UV perturbed CFT results with the IR cluster expan-\nsion from the Bethe ansatz.

Note,\nthough, that in some circumstances extra terms may be needed for the correct analytic\ncontinuation of the integrals, as discussed in section 4.3.1 of [13].\nBefore concluding this section we would like to mention that while this project was\nin progress and some of the analytic results already obtained as they are written here,\na preprint by Woynarovich appeared [15]. Our result (5.24) is similar in form to the\nexpression proposed by Woynarovich for the O(1) corrections to the free energy for a\none dimensional Bose gas with repulsive \u03b4-function interaction. However, there is also\na major difference. The string of kernels\n\u03c6(\u03b81 + \u03b82)\u03c6(\u03b82 \u2212 \u03b83) . . . \u03c6(\u03b8n \u2212 \u03b8n+1) , (5.31)\nin our (5.24) is replaced by a string of the form\n\u03c8(\u03b81, \u03b82)\u03c8(\u03b82, \u03b83) . . . \u03c8(\u03b8n, \u03b8n+1) , (5.32)\nwith 2\u03c8(k1, k2) = \u03c6(k1+ k2)+\u03c6(k1\u2212 k2) \u2261 K(k1, k2) in eq. (3.28) of [15] \u00a7. That terms\nof the type (5.31) appear in our formulae and not the expression (5.32) is unmistakably\nemerging from the Jacobians for the change of variable {ni} \u2192 {\u03b8i} and from their\ndefinitions as determinants. Woynarovich obtained his result by a calculation of the\nnext-to-leading contributions to the free energy, evaluating corrections to the standard\nsaddle point result. Such a direct computation would be a highly desirable alternative\nto the more indirect approach taken in this paper. Unfortunately, as stated in the\nparagraph after eq. (5.8) in section V of [15], for the field theory case the result of [15]\nis divergent in the ultraviolet, R = 1\/T \u2192 0, limit. This rules out the possibility of its\nconsistent agreement with a g-function defined in (perturbed) conformal field theory, of\nthe sort studied in [10, 13, 14] and this paper. Nevertheless, the mathematical similarity\nbetween the final outcomes is striking and deserves further investigation. To make a\nmore precise comparison note that\n2 log g\n(this paper)\n1 \u2194\n[\u2212T\u22121(\u2206F + \u03c60 + \u03c6L) + \u2206S ](ref. [15]) (5.33)\nand that \u2212T\u22121(\u2206F + \u03c60 + \u03c6L) matches the first, single-integral, term on the RHS of\n(5.24). \u2206S should then be compared with the infinite series in (5.24). In eq. (5.8) of\n[15] Woynoarovich notes that his \u2206S can be written as a sum of two contributions: an\nUV convergent part corresponding to 1\/2 of our infinite series, plus an UV divergent\nterm which has no counterpart in (5.24). Thus, in spite of the apparent similarities\nbetween our results and those of [15], there are also important discrepancies, which we\nare currently unable to resolve physically.\n\u00a7Notice that the kernels in the two cases are actually different, but the derivation in [15] is quite\ngeneral, and the result is independent of the precise functional form of the kernel.\n15\n6 Conclusions\nThis paper concerned the off-critical version of the boundary entropy g as defined in field\ntheory via the identity (1.6). It was shown numerically that the asymptotic infrared\nexpansion for ln g, obtained using the Bethe ansatz, matches UV results from conformal\nperturbation theory and the BTCSA at intermediate scales. This was a crucial step in\nthe analysis, because it meant that these two alternative definitions are equivalent, and it\nopened up the interesting possibility of deriving an exact expression for the conformally-\nperturbed g-function by using the Bethe ansatz technique. The first step toward this was\nto give the exact prescription, as the width of the strip R tends to infinity, to transform\nsums over the quantum numbers into integrals on rapidity variables. The idea is that\nthe subleading R-independent terms in this expansion should build up to form the\nboundary entropy g. A careful inspection of this expansion, motivated by the plausible\nassumption that the final result should depend on the bare single-particle energies only\nthrough their dressed versions, i.e. through the TBA pseudoenergies \u03b5(\u03b8), led to a partial\nresummation with corrections written purely in terms of \u03b5(\u03b8). The expressions for ln g\nwritten in (5.24) and in (5.30) are the main new results of the paper. Equation (5.24) was\ncarefully checked against results obtained using a combination of conformal perturbation\ntheory and the Bethe ansatz. The agreement was extremely good, and showed that the\nseries is rapidly convergent even in the ultraviolet region (see equations (5.27), (5.28)\nand (5.29)). Although it relied at various points on conjectures, we would also like to\nstress that our derivation avoided some of the pitfalls that potentially afflict more direct\ncomputations of the g-function: by working in the l \u2192 \u221e limit, we always dealt with\nstates in which all constituent particles were well-separated, and so the accuracy of the\nBethe ansatz wavefunctions for high particle density was not an issue.\nThere are many open problems related to this project, the first being that the method\nproposed, for all its virtues, is not particularly elegant and a direct approach would be\ndesirable for the generalization to more complicated models. It would also be interesting\nto study the corresponding quantities in theories with non-diagonal scattering and in\nsystems with massless excitations in the bulk [20].\nNote added:\nThere is a numerical error in the third term of the expansion for ln g1 given in eq.\n(5.29) above, which was pointed out to us by Aliosha Zamolodchikov. This is due to\nan inaccuracy in Mathematica\u2019s evaluation of the generalised hypergeometric function\n3F2 , which arises in formula (3.14) of ref. [13] for the associated quantity I2. In fact,\nAliosha Zamolodchikov has found a simplified expression for I2 , as follows:\nI2 =\n5\n8\nlog 5\u2212 5\n\u221a\n5\n8\nlog\n\u221a\n5 + 1\u221a\n5\u2212 1 +\n\u03c0\n4\ncot\n2\u03c0\n5\n= \u22120.08393791256821845466150 . . . (6.1)\n(this contrasts with the value \u22120.083937990 . . . quoted in ref. [13]). Accordingly, the\n16\nprediction (5.29) above should be corrected to\nln g1 (l) \u223c \u22120.3214826953191634 + 0.4836924437346968x\n5\n12\n\u2212 0.253117570093371858x + 0.0775x2 \u2212 0.036x3 + 0.0195x4 + . . .
