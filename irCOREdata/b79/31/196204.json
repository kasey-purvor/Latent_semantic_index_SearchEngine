Yeoman\n(tim.yeoman@ion.le.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nMagnetospheric long-period Ultra Low Frequency (ULF)\nwaves in the Pc 3\u20135 frequency band (2\u2013100 mHz) in the ter-\nrestrial magnetosphere represent Alfv\u00e9n waves standing be-\ntween magnetically conjugate points of the high-conductivity\nionosphere. These waves are usually categorized according\nto their predominant polarization: toroidal waves if the per-\nturbed magnetic field oscillates in an azimuthal direction,\nand poloidal waves if the magnetic field oscillates in a ra-\ndial (meridional) direction. Furthermore, these two kinds of\nwaves are distinguished according to their azimuthal wave\nnumber m: the toroidal modes are generally low-m waves\n(or equivalently a large scale size in the azimuthal direc-\ntion) and the poloidal modes are high-m waves (or equiva-\nlently a small scale size in the azimuthal direction). The two\nwave modes are thought to have distinct generation mecha-\nnisms. The low-m waves are usually supposed to be reso-\nnantly generated by an incoming fast mode arriving from the\nouter boundary of the magnetosphere (field line resonance)\n(e.g., Agapitov et al., 2009). The high-m waves generally\nhave m> 15, and are thought to have their energy source\nin drifting energetic particle fluxes entering the Earth\u2019s inner\nmagnetosphere from the magnetotail and subsequently expe-\nriencing gradient-curvature drift and thus moving around the\nEarth, constituting part of the global ring current (e.g., Bad-\ndeley et al., 2005b,a). These energetic particles can drive\nMHD wave modes through wave-particle interactions, for\nexample via the drift and drift-bounce resonance interactions,\nleading to perturbations in the electric and magnetic fields in\nthe magnetosphere and ionosphere when free energy is avail-\nable to the wave. Such high-m waves are presently a topic of\nconsiderable importance in both theoretical and experimental\nstudies. In much previous work it has been suggested (e.g.,\nSouthwood, 1976; Hughes et al., 1978, 1979) that the part of\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1500 T. K. Yeoman et al.: Intermediate-m ULF waves generated by substorm injection\nthe ion distribution function which is able to feed energy into\nthe wave is that where\n\u2202f\n\/\n\u2202W > 0, (1)\nwhere f is the ion distribution function and W is the en-\nergy. Such non-Maxwellian ion distribution functions, of-\nten termed \u201cbump-on-tail\" distributions, can be created quite\ncommonly by naturally-occurring processes in the magne-\ntosphere, such as substorm-associated particle injections or\nother particle acceleration processes. Subsequent to such an\ninjection the ions are subject to gradient-curvature andE\u2227B\ndrifts and move westwards, arriving at a given magnetic lo-\ncal time at different universal times due to the energy de-\npendence of magnetospheric drift paths. Even under steady\nstate conditions particles follow energy-dependent drift paths\nwhich can lead to the formation of such bump-on-tail dis-\ntributions (Cowley and Ashour-Abdallah, 1976; Glassmeier\net al., 1999a; Ozeke and Mann, 2001). Subsequent to such an\ninjection and drift process, on occasion particles will match\nthe local drift-bounce resonance condition (Southwood et al.,\n1969),\n\u03c9wave\u2212mwave\u03c9d=N\u03c9b, (2)\nwhere N is either zero (drift resonance) or an integer (usu-\nally \u00b11, drift bounce resonance). In either case \u03c9wave, \u03c9b,\nand \u03c9d are the angular frequencies of the wave, the proton\nbounce, and the proton azimuthal drift, respectively. Such\nwave-particle interactions are processes of fundamental im-\nportance in collisionless astrophysical plasmas.\nAlthough this picture seems generally accepted, there are\nsome inconsistencies concerning the generation of the low-\nm waves. Some key features of field line resonances have\nyet to be observed (Glassmeier et al., 1999b). In addition,\ndue to the very different spatial structure of the Alfv\u00e9n and\nfast modes their interaction is rather weak and the genera-\ntion mechanism may become rather ineffective (Leonovich,\n2001). Saka et al. (1992) also observed a Pc5 wave event\nwithm\u223c 1 associated with increased fluxes of energetic elec-\ntrons in the magnetosphere and interpreted it as a wave gener-\nated not through coupling between a fast and Alfv\u00e9n mode,\nbut rather by electron injection. These facts hint that some\nlow- and intermediate-m waves can be generated through\nmechanisms other than resonant excitation by the fast mode,\nperhaps by high energy particles, as suggested for the high-m\nwave populations.\nIn previous work the structure and occurrence of ener-\ngetic particle-driven waves have been studied by a num-\nber of authors in the magnetosphere with in situ spacecraft\ndata, for both case studies (e.g., Hughes et al., 1979; Taka-\nhashi et al., 1990; Eriksson et al., 2006; Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2007,\n2008) and statistically (e.g., Kokubun, 1985; Takahashi et al.,\n1985; Anderson et al., 1990; Woch et al., 1990; Engebretson\net al., 1992; Lessard et al., 1999). These studies identified a\nstrong population of particle-driven waves in the dusk sector.\nEvents were also detected near dawn, however, and a vari-\nety of wave-particle interaction modes have been invoked.\nGround-based observations have also contributed greatly to\nour knowledge of particle-driven waves. A number of cate-\ngories of waves have been identified in such data, which have\ndistinct wave characteristics and occurrence conditions. Gi-\nant \u201cPg\" pulsations have been observed on the ground and in\nsitu by orbiting satellites at times when geomagnetic condi-\ntions are quiet. A statistical study of 34 of these events ob-\nserved on the EISCAT magnetometer cross network in north-\nern Scandinavia found a peak in occurrence of these waves\nin the dawn\/prenoon sector; no events were observed in the\nafternoon (Chisham and Orr, 1991). The average value of the\nazimuthal wave number was \u223c\u221226 for the 34 events (here\nnegative m is taken to represent westward phase propaga-\ntion). Pgs have been related to drift-bounce resonance mech-\nanisms with both symmetric (e.g., Takahashi et al., 1992) and\nantisymmetric (e.g., Chisham and Orr, 1991) wave modes,\nand the wave-particle interaction responsible for their gener-\nation thus remains controversial.\nStorm time Pc5 pulsations have been seen in STARE (the\nScandinavian Twin Auroral Radar Experiment; Greenwald\net al., 1978) data (Allan et al., 1982, 1983). Storm time\nPc5 pulsations are compressional waves of high m number\n(m=\u221220 to \u221280) with a frequency in the Pc5 range (1.7\u2013\n6.7 mHz) which have been associated with a drift-resonance\nsource mechanism. Drift resonance involves fundamental\nwave modes, with the electric field symmetric about the\nequator (i.e. an equatorial electric field antinode). Contrary\nto the Pg events discussed above, storm-time Pc5s are ob-\nserved in the dusk sector during magnetically disturbed in-\ntervals.\nSome more recent results from a High Frequency (HF)\nDoppler sounder, DOPE (the DOppler Pulsation Experi-\nment; Wright et al., 1997) at Troms\u00f8, northern Norway have\ndemonstrated the existence of populations of high-m waves\nin both the morning and afternoon sectors. In this case the\nmorning sector waves were the most populous, and had m-\nnumbers of order 100, high enough to screen the waves com-\npletely from ground magnetometers (Yeoman et al., 2000).\nIn later studies using DOPE, Baddeley et al. (2005a) demon-\nstrated that waves with m-numbers of 100\u2013200 were as-\nsociated with a source in proton populations with energies\n\u223c10 keV, with a drift-bounce resonance mechanism most\nlikely in the prenoon sector, but with both drift- and drift-\nbounce resonance mechanisms possible in the postnoon sec-\ntor. Using a combination of DOPE observations and in situ\nenergetic particle measurements, Baddeley et al. (2005b)\nwere able to demonstrate a statistically significant relation-\nship between such high-m wave occurrence and conjugate\nmeasurements of non-Maxwellian particle populations in the\noverlying magnetosphere.\nAnother classification of high-m waves, similar to those\ndescribed above, but with an equatorward phase motion, have\nbeen seen in SABRE (the Sweden And Britain auroral Radar\nAnn.

Yeoman et al.: Intermediate-m ULF waves generated by substorm injection 1501\nExperiment; Nielsen et al., 1983) coherent radar system in\nthe dusk sector (Waldock et al., 1983; Tian et al., 1991; Yeo-\nman et al., 1992). Similar observations were seen in the\nBARS (Bistatic Auroral Radar System; McNamara et al.,\n1983) coherent radar by Grant et al. (1992). Later, Yeo-\nman and Wright (2001) presented ULF wave observations\nclose to local noon using the HF radar artificial backscatter\ntechnique at Troms\u00f8 which demonstrated both wave activ-\nity characteristic of drift-bounce resonance and wave activity\ncharacteristic of drift resonance activity, with the latter waves\nshowing equatorward phase propagation. Recently Yeoman\net al. (2008) presented observations of similar populations\nof equatorward-propagating wave events driven by energetic\nparticle populations in the outer magnetosphere, at an L-shell\nof 15. These previous observations of equatorward propagat-\ning waves are the most similar observations to a newly iden-\ntified population of ULF wave events, where an equatorward\npropagating wave which is characterised by an intermediate\nazimuthal wave number is associated with a newly-injected\nenergetic particle population. An exemplary case study of\nsuch a wave is presented here, and its possible source mech-\nanism is discussed.\n2 Instrumentation\nThe ULF wave data presented here were recorded by the\nSuperDARN radars at Hankasalmi, Finland and \u00deykkvib\u00e6r,\nIceland. Full details of SuperDARN are given in Greenwald\net al. (1995) and Chisham et al. (2007). Figure 1 presents\nthe fields of view of the radar scan modes used in this study.\nChannel A of both radars employed a full 16-beam scan of\n45 km range gates, starting at a range of 180 km, and is out-\nlined in black. Channel B was restricted to 1 beam, again\nwith 45 km range gates. Hankasalmi sounded beam 9, point-\ning northwards, whereas \u00deykkvib\u00e6r sounded beam 5, point-\ning north and east. These beams are outlined in blue in\nFig. 1. The integration time of the radars was 3 s, yielding\na full radar scan from Channel A every minute, and single\nbeam data with 3 s time resolution on Channel B. Data are\nalso presented from the IMAGE (International Monitor for\nAuroral Geomagnetic Effects; L\u00fchr, 1994) magnetometer ar-\nray, which has a sampling interval of 10 s. The time inter-\nvals under study were selected from intervals identified us-\ning the FUV instrument (Mende et al., 2000a,b) on the IM-\nAGE spacecraft. Specifically use is made of the list of 2437\nsubstorm events occurring between May 2000 and Decem-\nber 2002 identified by Frey et al. (2004). This list was subse-\nquently extended to 4193 substorm events after considering\nthe 5-year period up to December 2005.\n3 Data\nThe ULF wave event case study presented here occurred on\n21 March 2002, and was selected from a dataset derived from\nGeographic coordinates\n60\u00b0N\n70\u00b0N\n70\u00b0N\n0\u00b0E 15\u00b0E 30\u00b0E 45\u00b0E\n SOR\n MAS\n MUO\n PEL\n KEV\n OUJ\n HAN\n NUR\n BJN\n NAL\n SOD\n KIL\n TRO\n HOP HOR\n LYR\n LEK  IVA ABK\n AND\n DOB\n LOZ\n RVK\nFig. 1.

The list of\nsubstorm events was reduced by selecting substorm onset\nevents which occurred within 1 h local time of the location\nof the Hankasalmi radar. The list was further reduced by se-\nlecting only those times when a high time resolution beam\nwas available on beam 9 of the Hankasalmi radar, and good\nquality data coverage was available on both the Hankasalmi\nand \u00deykkvib\u00e6r radars. The data coverage and substorm de-\nvelopment are indicated in Fig. 2. The upper panels of Fig. 2\npresent the data coverage of the two SuperDARN radars,\nshowing the colour-coded ionospheric flow velocities across\nthe full fields of view at 23:37 UT. The Hankasalmi data are\npresented in Fig. 2a and the \u00deykkvib\u00e6r data in Fig. 2b. Red\n(negative) velocities are away from the radar and blue (posi-\ntive) velocities are towards the radar. The data are presented\nin magnetic latitude-magnetic local time coordinates. The\nradial dashed lines are separated by 1 h local time, with lo-\ncal midnight being marked by the vertical dashed line. The\ndashed circles indicate magnetic latitude at 10\u25e6 separations.\nExcellent data coverage is seen across a substantial region of\nboth radar fields-of-view. The lower panels Fig. 2c\u2013e present\nthe corresponding IMAGE FUV Wideband Imaging Cam-\nera (WIC) instrument in the same coordinate system. The\nsubstorm onset was identified by Frey et al. (2004) as start-\ning at 23:35:19 UT, at a geomagnetic latitude of 66.76\u25e6 and\na magnetic local time of 02:00. Fig. 2c shows the auroral\nsignature of the substorm at the identified onset time.

It is also observed in the immediate\naftermath of a substorm expansion phase onset, collocated\nwith the substorm auroral expansion, and thus we assume\nclosely associated with the substorm energetic particle injec-\ntion. As such the wave activity is most similar to previous\nobservations of equatorward propagating ULF waves.

Free energy should be available on occasion in the elec-\ntron populations when the conditions in equations Eq. (1) and\nEq. (2) are met for electrons, although in the case of electrons\nthe much more rapid electron bounce period would preclude\nsolutions for conditions other than N = 0 in Eq. (2). Such\nenergy sources in drifting electron clouds have been consid-\nered as wave sources by Saka et al. (1992), Saka et al. (1996),\nPilipenko et al. (2001a) and Pilipenko et al. (2001b). Such a\nmechanism involving electron clouds offers no explanation\nfor the observed equatorward phase propagation, however.\nAn alternative approach is considered below.\nAs is well known, in the m\u223c 1 limit two MHD modes, the\nfast mode and the Alfv\u00e9n, are coupled. However, when these\ntwo modes have a different parallel structure (Leonovich,\n2001) this coupling may under some circumstances be ne-\nglected and the excitation of the Alfv\u00e9n waves can be stud-\nied alone. The theory of the generation of this mode by\nsubstorm injected particles has been elaborated by Mager\nand Klimushkin (2008) and Mager et al. (2009). Although\nthat theory was developed for the proton-driven high-m wave\ncase, its qualitative features can be generalized for a more\ngeneral situation, with lower m-numbers and a wave source\nin the energetic electron population (see Zolotukhina et al.,\n2008).\nThe azimuthally drifting inhomogeneity provided by the\ndrifting cloud of injected energetic particles can be consid-\nered as a sudden impulse propagating from one location on\nthe azimuthal coordinate to another with the drift angular ve-\nlocity \u03c9d(x). Thus, let us consider the Alfv\u00e9n waves excited\nby a sudden impulse with an azimuthal structure of the form\neim\u03d5 , where m is the azimuthal wave number and \u03d5 is the\nazimuthal angle. Since the Alfv\u00e9n waves represent field line\noscillations, each field line having its own eigenfrequency\n(Hasegawa et al., 1983), the wave electric field is given by\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/28\/1499\/2010\/ Ann.

The dashed line\nrepresents the drifting source (energetic particle cloud), positive \u03c6\nis in the direction of the drift (westward for protons, eastward for\nelectrons). The bold line corresponds to kx = 0 (a purely poloidal\npolarization of the wave).\nthe expression (Leonovich and Mazur, 1998; Klimushkin and\nMager, 2004)\nE= |E|ei9 (4)\nwith the phase\n9 =\u2212\u03c9(x)t+m\u03d5, (5)\nwhere \u03c9 is the resonant eigenfrequency and x is the radial\ncoordinate. The azimuthal wave number m is determined by\nthe exciting impulse.\nFollowing Mager et al. (2009), for a wave source in\nan azimuthally drifting inhomogeneity, the expression for\nthe wave field must show the fact that the Alfv\u00e9n waves\nhave negligible energy propagation transverse to field lines.\nHence, Eq. (4) is replaced by\nE=2(\u03c9dt\u2212\u03d5)|E|ei9 . (6)\nHere 2(\u03c9dt\u2212\u03d5) is the Heaviside step function. The wave\nphase is still given by Eq. (5), but the m number is not arbi-\ntrarily imposed. Instead, as the excitation is due to a moving\nsource, in the source reference system the (Doppler-shifted)\nphase just behind the source is constant, thus the transformed\nwave frequency \u03c9\u2032=\u03c9\u2212m\u03c9d must be zero. Hence, we ob-\ntain an expression for the m-number:\nm= \u03c9(x)\n\u03c9d(x)\n, (7)\njust as in Eq. (3). This value depends on the radial coordinate\n(simply through the fact that different azimuthal wavenum-\nbers will be resonant with the moving source at different\nL-shells). Finally, we get the following expression for the\nphase:\n9 =\u2212\u03c9(x)t+ \u03c9(x)\n\u03c9d(x)\n\u03d5. (8)\nThe bounce-averaged drift frequency in the inhomogeneous\nfield is proportional to the particle energy \u000f and the radial\ncoordinate x:\n\u03c9d' 8\u00d710\u22123\u000fx, (9)\nwhere \u03c9d, x, and \u000f are measured in degrees per minute, Earth\nradii, and keV, respectively (Roederer, 1970). The energy of\nsubstorm injected particles also depends on the radial coordi-\nnate, so in effect the drift frequency happens to depend only\non the L-shell. Let us assume that drift frequency increases\nwith the radial coordinate. This case can be realized in the\nmagnetosphere under conditions where there is a consider-\nable loss of injected protons (e.g. Southwood, 1980). In this\ncase, the lines of constant phase in the x-\u03d5 plane are depicted\nin Fig. 8 (note that the whole picture is shifting to the right\nalong with the source).\nThe wavevector radial component is determined as\nkx \u22619 \u2032=\u2212\n(\n\u03c9\n\u03c9d\n)\u2032\n(\u03c9dt\u2212\u03d5)\u2212\u03c9t \u03c9\n\u2032\nd\n\u03c9d\n, (10)\nwhere a prime indicates a radial derivative. Note that \u03c9dt\u2212\n\u03d5 \u2265 0 since the wave appears in some azimuthal location si-\nmultaneously with the particle cloud arrival in the same spot.\nThus, provided that \u03c9\u2032d > 0, the first right-hand side term is\npositive, while the second is negative. Just after the moment\nof the source passing a point with a given azimuthal coordi-\nnate, the radial component is negative, kx < 0. However, it\nis finite, hence the wave has a polarization between toroidal\nand poloidal. A negative value of the wavevector radial com-\nponent means a negative radial phase velocity of the wave;\nprojected onto the ionosphere along geomagnetic field lines,\nthis implies an equatorward phase propagation.\nAt the moment\nt =\u03d5 (\u03c9\/\u03c9d)\n\u2032\n\u03c9\u2032\n(11)\nkx goes to zero the wave becomes poloidal. After that it\nchanges its sign and becomes positive: the polarization of\nthe wave becomes mixed again and, due to the phase mixing,\nthe wave gradually transforms into toroidally-polarized one.\nThe characteristic transformation time is\n\u03c4 = 2 m0l\n0L\n, (12)\nwhere m0 and 0 are a characteristic azimuthal wave num-\nber and angular frequency for the wave, L is the L-shell of\nthe wave and l is a characteristic (magnetospheric) scale size\n(Mager and Klimushkin, 2008). If the wave attenuation is\ntaken into account, then the wave does not have enough time\nto transform into a toroidal polarization, and the maximum\nwave amplitude will correspond to a mixed polarization with\na pronounced poloidal component.\nAnn.

Observations from\nthe Hankasalmi radar revealed that the wave generated in\nthe magnetosphere had a period of 580 s (a frequency of\n1.7 mHz) and was characterized by an intermediate az-\nimuthal wave number (m = 13), with an eastwards phase\npropagation. It had a significant poloidal component and\na rapid equatorward phase propagation (\u223c 62\u25e6 per degree\nof latitude). The total equatorward phase variation over\nthe wave signatures visible in the radar field-of-view ex-\nceeded the 180\u25e6 associated with field line resonances. Data\nfrom a north-east directed beam of the \u00deykkvib\u00e6r radar\nwas consistent with the period and phase behaviour inferred\nfrom Hankasalmi. The wave period observed here was\nsomewhat longer than previous observations of equatorward-\npropagating events (see Table 1). This may well be a con-\nsequence of the wave occurring very shortly after the sub-\nstorm expansion, on stretched, near-midnight field lines char-\nacterised by longer eigenfrequencies than those involved in\nprevious observations.\nThe data can be interpreted in terms of the theory of the\nwave generation by substorm injected particles as elaborated\nby Mager and Klimushkin (2008), Mager et al. (2009) and\nZolotukhina et al. (2008), with, in this case an electron cloud\nof energy \u223c33 keV acting as the wave source. According to\nthe theory, wave comes into being with mixed polarization.\nAs the wave moves farther and farther away from the source,\nit becomes poloidally-polarized. Furthermore, the wave fi-\nnally transforms into a toroidal polarization. If the wave at-\ntenuation is taken into account (for example, due to the fi-\nnite conductivity of the ionosphere or wave-particle interac-\ntion), then the wave does not have enough time to transform\ninto a toroidal polarization, and the maximum wave ampli-\ntude will correspond to a mixed polarization. The azimuthal\nwave number m is determined by the wave eigenfrequency \u03c9\nand the drift velocity of the source \u03c9d: m\u223c\u03c9\/\u03c9d. Thus, to\ncreate the intermediate-m waves, the injected particles must\nhave rather high energies for a given L-shell, in comparison\nto previous observations of wave events with equatorward\npolarization (see Table 1). The high energy and hence rapid\nazimuthal drift of the particles also explains the small time\nlag between the substorm onset and the detection of the wave.\nLow and intermediate-m waves could also be generated\nby means of bump on tail instability under the drift reso-\nnance condition as outlined in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) (Mager and\nKlimushkin, 2005). However, in this case there is a problem\nwith the poloidal polarization of the wave, since the wave\nsoon transforms into a toroidal one due to the phase mixing\n(Klimushkin, 2000, 2007; Klimushkin and Mager, 2004). In\naddition, this mechanism offers no explanation of the equa-\ntorward propagation of the wave. Besides, it would be more\nappropriate to regard the instability as a mechanism for wave\nenhancement rather than as the source. To set this mecha-\nnism to work requires some germ amplitude, which could be\nprovided by the moving particle cloud source, as suggested\nin this paper. A statistical investigation into the characteris-\ntics of the new wave type presented here, and its relationship\nto the associated substorm activity, will be presented in a fol-\nlowing paper.\nAcknowledgements.
