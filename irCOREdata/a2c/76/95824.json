The theory of judgment ag-\ngregation asks how several individuals\u0092judgments on some logically connected propo-\nsitions can be aggregated into consistent collective judgments. The aim of this intro-\nduction is to show how ideas from the familiar theory of preference aggregation can\nbe extended to this more general case. We \u0085rst translate a proof of Arrow\u0092s impos-\nsibility theorem into the new setting, so as to motivate some of the central concepts\nand conditions leading to analogous impossibilities, as discussed in the symposium.\nWe then consider each of four possible escape-routes explored in the symposium.\nJEL classi\u0085cation: D70, D71\nKeywords: Judgment aggregation, Arrow\u0092s theorem; escape routes\n1 Introduction\nEver since the publication of Arrow\u0092s classic book, Social Choice and Individual Values [1],\nthe theory of aggregation has been a thriving area of research. Arrow\u0092s book focused on the\naggregation of preferences, understood as the aggregation of multiple individual orderings\nover a set of mutually exclusive alternatives into a corresponding collective ordering or\ncollective choice. Since the need to aggregate preferences arises in many economic and\npolitical contexts, Arrow\u0092s work struck a chord with scholars across the social sciences.\nIn fact, the interest in preference aggregation goes back at least to Condorcet and, less\nformally, to Rousseau in the 18th century, but possibly even to medieval scholars such\nas Ramon Llull (circa 1232-1315) and Nicolaus Cusanus (1401-1464) (McLean [40]). The\nbroad relevance of the problem of preference aggregation and especially the power and\nelegance of Arrow\u0092s axiomatic approach may also explain why the bulk of almost six\ndecades of social-choice-theoretic research has focused on the aggregation of preferences\nor on the closely related problems of aggregating individual utilities or individual welfare.\n\u0003C. List, Departments of Government and Philosophy, London School of Economics; B. Polak, Depart-\nment of Economics and School of Management, Yale University. The present symposium is based on a\nCowles Foundation workshop on judgment aggregation, held at Yale, September 2006. We are very grate-\nful to Itzhak Gilboa for co-organizing the workshop and helping us launch this project. We also thank the\nsymposium contributors, the referees and other workshop participants for their input, advice and patience.\nThis introduction further bene\u0085tted from discussions with Don Brown, Franz Dietrich, Klaus Nehring and\nClemens Puppe. Finally, we thank Karl Shell and Susan Schulze for their editorial support and encourage-\nment. List\u0092s work was supported by a Philip Leverhulme Prize of the Leverhulme Trust and a Laurance\nS. Rockefeller Visiting Fellowship at Princeton University.\n1\nBut there are many contexts in which we want to aggregate individuals\u0092opinions or\njudgments apart from mere preferences. For example, consider a court of several judges\nwho must decide a case. We may be interested not only in the court\u0092s \u0085nal judgment in the\ncase (e.g., whether the defendant is liable) but also in its \u0085ndings on the facts of the case\n(did the defendant do some harm) and on the question of the relevant legal obligation (was\nthe defendant obliged not to do this harm). Thus we may want to aggregate the judges\u0092\nindividual opinions on each of these issues. Elsewhere, consider a search committee charged\nto select among job candidates. Here, we may be interested not only in the committee\u0092s\n\u0085nal selection of which candidates to hire, but also in their \u0085ndings on whether each\ncandidate meets certain criteria for the job, and maybe even in their judgment on which\ncriteria must be met by any successful candidate. Again, we may want to aggregate the\ncommittee members\u0092 opinions on each of these issues. Or thirdly, consider an expert\npanel that is asked to give advice on a set of complex scienti\u0085c questions. Here, we\nmay be interested not only in the panel\u0092s view on whether there will be a critical global\ntemperature increase, but also in their judgments on whether various kinds of emissions are\nabove certain thresholds, and what the signi\u0085cance of those thresholds is. Other types of\nopinions that we might want to aggregate but which are distinct from preferences include\ncategorizations, say, of animals into species or collections of symptoms into a de\u0085ned\ndisease.\nThese aggregation problems di\u00a4er from preference aggregation not just in their inter-\npretation, but also in the constraints governing them. Aggregation problems are generally\ngoverned by three types of constraints: constraints on the individual inputs (such as univer-\nsal domain), constraints on the collective outputs (such as transitivity and completeness),\nand constraints on the relationship between the inputs and outputs (such as Arrow\u0092s inde-\npendence or Pareto conditions). In Arrovian preference aggregation problems, the inputs\nand outputs are constrained to be complete and transitive preference orderings. Once we\nmove from preference aggregation to more general aggregation problems, input and output\nconstraints can take the form of requiring sets of accepted positions to be logically consis-\ntent (relative to an appropriate criterion of consistency). In the legal setting, for example,\nwe typically want to exclude the combined collective \u0085nding that \u0091the defendant did it\u0092,\n\u0091he was obliged not to do it\u0092, but \u0091he is not liable\u0092(following the background constraint\nthat harm and obligation are necessary and su\u00a2 cient for liability). In an expert panel, we\nwant the overall collective viewpoint to be logically coherent. Elsewhere, input and output\nconstraints may come from feasibility conditions. In our hiring-committee setting, there\nmay be a maximum number of candidates we can hire. Alternatively, more complicated\nconstraints might be imposed on the search committee by a higher authority: for example,\nthey may have to hire at least two candidates of which one, at least, must be a woman. In\nproblems of placing items into categories, we may want to restrict the inputs and outputs\nto partitions or perhaps nested collections of the items.\nThis paper \u0096and the symposium it introduces \u0096is devoted to a recent e\u00a4ort to develop\na general theory that can address these and other problems of aggregation: the theory\nof judgment aggregation. The theory\u0092s central question can be summarized as follows.\nSuppose a group of individuals is faced with a set of binary questions, each admitting\na \u0091yes\/no\u0092or \u0091true\/false\u0092answer. Suppose, further, the questions are interconnected, in\nthat the answers given to some of them constrain the answers that can consistently be\ngiven to others. How, then, can the group arrive at a consistent collective set of answers\nto these questions, based on its members\u0092individual answers? This problem, formulated\n2\nin the present form by List and Pettit [36, 37] with precursors in Guilbaud [27], Wilson\n[61] and Rubinstein and Fishburn [56], is surprisingly general and, as will become clear,\nsubsumes the aggregation problems mentioned above, including the problem of preference\naggregation.\nThe focus of this introductory paper will be to show how ideas from preference aggre-\ngation translate into new ideas in the more general setting of judgment aggregation. In\npart, we hope this o\u00a4ers a bridge to the new literature for those familiar with the old. We\nalso hope to illustrate what is and what is not immediately generalizable from classical\nsocial choice theory to judgment aggregation, and what those generalizations look like.\nFor example, the recent literature on judgment aggregation started with a generalization\nof Condorcet\u0092s paradox (List and Pettit [36, 37]): Just as majority voting can yield cyclical\ncollective preferences, so majority voting on any set of binary issues with certain logical\ninterconnections can lead to inconsistent collective judgments.1\nTo illustrate, return to the expert-panel example above. Let p be the proposition that\nCO2 emissions are above a given threshold; let p ! q be the proposition that if CO2\nemissions are above that threshold, then there will be a critical temperature increase; and\nlet q be the proposition that there will be a critical temperature increase. Consider the\ntwo matrices in Table 1, one representing the opinions of an illustrative panel of experts\nand the other representing the preferences in Condorcet\u0092s classic paradox. In each case, all\nthree individuals hold perfectly consistent opinions, in the expert-panel case understood in\nterms of propositional logic and in Condorcet\u0092s case understood in terms of the standard\ntransitivity and completeness conditions on preferences. In both cases, majority voting\nfails to preserve consistency from the individual to the collective level: The majority\nopinions are inconsistent by the relevant criteria. A similar pattern can occur even with\nthe intuitively simplest of all logical connections, such as those between two propositions\n(p; q) and their conjunction (p ^ q).\np p! q :q x \u001f y y \u001f z z \u001f x\nIndividual 1\nfp; p! q; qg X X \u0002\nIndividual 1\nx \u001f y \u001f z X X \u0002\nIndividual 2\nf:p; p! q;:qg \u0002 X X\nIndividual 2\ny \u001f z \u001f x \u0002 X X\nIndividual 3\nfp;:(p! q);:qg X \u0002 X\nIndividual 3\nz \u001f x \u001f y X \u0002 X\nMajority X X X Majority X X X\nTable 1: The problem of majority inconsistency\nGiven this relationship between Condorcet\u0092s paradox and the more general problem of\nmajority inconsistency, it is natural to ask whether Arrow\u0092s impossibility theorem can be\ngeneralized as well. Just as Arrow\u0092s theorem shows that Condorcet\u0092s paradox is the tip\nof the iceberg of a deeper impossibility result on preference aggregation, so one may ask\nwhether the problem of majority inconsistency is an instance of a more general di\u00a2 culty\n1This observation \u0096often called the discursive dilemma (see also Pettit [53], Brennan [3]) \u0096was inspired\nby a related but distinct observation in the study of decision making in collegial courts, the so-called\ndoctrinal paradox (Kornhauser and Sager [30, 31], Kornhauser [29]). The doctrinal paradox consists in\nthe fact that in decisions on a conclusion, such as whether a defendant is liable, based on several logically\nrelated premises, such as whether he did some harm and whether he was obliged not to do it, majority\nvoting on the premises may support a di\u00a4erent decision from majority voting on the conclusion.\n3\nin judgment aggregation. The literature now contains a sequence of results in response to\nthis question, some of which are included in the present symposium and will be reviewed\nin detail below. The gist of these results is that, for a large class of aggregation prob-\nlems, there exist no aggregation rules satisfying some Arrow-inspired conditions such as a\nuniversal domain condition, a collective rationality condition, an informational condition\nakin to Arrow\u0092s independence of irrelevant alternatives, and some minimal democratic\nconditions such as unanimity preservation, non-dictatorship or anonymity.\nThese results, in turn, can be traced back to three di\u00a4erent intellectual origins: some\nwork on abstract algebraic aggregation,2 some logic-based work on judgment aggregation,3\nand some related work on strategy-proof social choice.4 However, as will become clear, the\nliterature has not been con\u0085ned to proving impossibility results, but has also considered\nhow to avoid them. Arguably, the key contribution of the impossibility results is precisely\nto give us some insights into which requirements on aggregation can be upheld, and which\nmust be relaxed, in order to arrive at compelling solutions to various aggregation problems.\n(For literature reviews, see List and Puppe [38] and List [35].)\nThe present paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the logic-based\nmodel of judgment aggregation, following List and Pettit [36] and Dietrich [6]. In Section\n3, we discuss how Arrow\u0092s impossibility theorem generalizes from preference aggregation\nto general judgment-aggregation settings, thereby introducing the \u0085rst two symposium\npapers (Nehring and Puppe [49], Dokow and Holzman [23]) and some related results\n(e.g., Dietrich and List [9]). In Section 4, we turn to several positive results on how\nto avoid the Arrovian impossibility in judgment aggregation and introduce the following\n\u0085ve symposium papers (Dietrich and List [16], Dokow and Holzman [24], Dietrich and\nMongin [20], Nehring and Puppe [50], Dietrich [8]). In Section 5, we comment on the\nrelationship between the logic-based model of judgment aggregation and the alternative,\nabstract algebraic model. In Section 6, we o\u00a4er some concluding remarks on future avenues\nof research.\n2 The logic-based model\nLetN = f1; 2; :::; ng be a \u0085nite set of individuals (n \u0015 2) faced with a judgment aggregation\nproblem. The set of propositions on which judgments are to be made is called the agenda\nand de\u0085ned as a set X of sentences from a suitable logic, where X is non-empty, closed\nunder negation (i.e., if p 2 X, then :p 2 X, where : stands for \u0091not\u0092) and, for our\npurposes, \u0085nite. Propositions are denoted p, q, r, and so on. We assume that double\nnegations cancel each other out. The set X might contain not just atomic propositions\nbut also compound propositions such as p ^ q (\u0091p and q\u0092) or p ! q (\u0091if p then q\u0092). In the\n2Wilson [61], followed by Rubinstein and Fishburn [56] and Dokow and Holzman [23] in this sympo-\nsium, developed an abstract algebraic framework for studying the aggregation of attributes distinct from\npreferences and proved a theorem that generalizes Arrow\u0092s theorem in this framework.\n3List and Pettit [36, 37] introduced a logic-based model of judgment aggregation and proved an im-\npossibility theorem that also has a corollary for preference aggregation. This work was strengthened and\nextended by Pauly and van Hees [52], Dietrich [5, 6] and others, and generalized to subsume Arrow\u0092s\ntheorem (Dietrich and List [9]).\n4Nehring and Puppe [47] proved some results on strategy-proof social choice, which have several corol-\nlaries for judgment aggregation, including Arrovian-style results, as presented in this symposium (Nehring\nand Puppe [49]).\n4\nintroductory expert-panel example, the agenda is\nX = fp;:p; p! q;:(p! q); q;:qg,\nand in a preference aggregation problem over three alternatives x, y and z, it is\nX = fx \u001f y; y \u001f x; x \u001f z; z \u001f x; y \u001f z; z \u001f yg,\nwith the stipulation that x \u001f y is the negation of y \u001f x and so on.\nEach individual i\u0092s judgment set is the set of propositions Ji \u0012 X that he or she\naccepts (e.g., endorses or believes to be true). A judgment set is called consistent if it is\na consistent set in the relevant sense of the logic (more on this below). It is complete if it\ncontains a member of each proposition-negation pair p;:p 2 X. An n-tuple of judgment\nsets across the individuals in N , (J1; :::; Jn), is called a pro\u0085le.\nAn aggregation rule is a function F that assigns to each pro\u0085le of individual judgment\nsets (J1; :::; Jn) in some domain a collective judgment set J = F (J1; :::; Jn), interpreted\nas the set of propositions accepted by the group N as a whole. Usually, we require the\ndomain of F to be the set of all pro\u0085les of consistent and complete judgment sets on\nX (universal domain), and we require the collective judgment set to be consistent and\ncomplete (sometimes called collective rationality). These requirements, however, are not\nbuilt into the model itself and are sometimes relaxed.\nAn example of an aggregation rule ismajority voting, where, for every pro\u0085le (J1; :::; Jn)\nin the domain,\nF (J1; :::; Jn) = fp 2 X : jfi 2 N : p 2 Jigj > n=2g.\nAnother example is a dictatorship, where there exists some \u0085xed individual i 2 N such\nthat, for every pro\u0085le (J1; :::; Jn) in the domain,\nF (J1; :::; Jn) = Ji.\nOther examples will be considered later.\nWhile all these de\u0085nitions should be fairly straightforward, we have glossed over a\ncentral element of the model: the logic, which captures the notion of consistency. Gener-\nally, a logic is a non-empty set L of sentences, called propositions, that is endowed with a\nnegation operator : (\u0091not\u0092) and a notion of consistency, according to which some subsets\nof L are consistent and the others inconsistent, subject to some standard conditions.5\nIn standard propositional logic, for example, a set of propositions is consistent if all its\nelements can be simultaneously true. Thus the set fp; q; p ! qg is consistent (where p\nand q are atomic propositions) whereas the sets fp; p ! q;:qg and fp;:pg are not. In\nthe logic we have used to express preference aggregation problems, a set of propositions is\nconsistent if it does not breach the rationality conditions on preferences (such as asymme-\ntry, transitivity and connectedness). Thus the set fx \u001f y; y \u001f zg is consistent while the\nset fx \u001f y; y \u001f z; z \u001f xg is not. We can embed feasibility constraints on individual and\ncollective judgments into the notion of consistency in the logic. For example, in the case\nof a hiring committee, the propositions p and q might be \u0091hire Paul\u0092and \u0091hire Quincy\u0092,\n5First, every proposition-negation pair fp;:pg \u0012 L is inconsistent. Second, subsets of consistent sets\nS \u0012 L are consistent. Third, the empty set ; is consistent, and every consistent set S \u0012 L has a consistent\nsuperset T \u0012 L containing a member of each proposition-negation pair fp;:pg \u0012 L. For details, see\nDietrich [6].\n5\nrespectively. If there is only one job opening, then the set fpg is consistent while the set\nfp; qg is inconsistent.\nA proposition p 2 L for which neither fpg nor f:pg is inconsistent is called contingent.\nFor convenience, we include only contingent propositions in the agenda. Further, we say\nthat a set S \u0012 L logically entails a proposition p 2 L, written S ` p, if S [ f:pg is\ninconsistent. For example, in standard propositional logic, the set fp; p ! qg logically\nentails the proposition q. In the logic used to express preference aggregation problems,\nthe set fx \u001f y; y \u001f zg entails the proposition x \u001f z. For our hiring committee with only\none opening, the proposition p logically entails :q. By substituting di\u00a4erent logics into\nthe model, we can capture a great variety of di\u00a4erent aggregation problems.\n3 Generalizing Arrow\u0092s theorem\nTo see how Arrow\u0092s theorem generalizes from preference aggregation to aggregation prob-\nlems involving other logical relationships or feasibility constraints, we will state and prove\nArrow\u0092s theorem and try to translate the proof to more general settings. Although the\nresult is not the most elegant proof of a generalized impossibility theorem (the existing,\ndirect proofs fare better on that count), the aim is to learn something from the transla-\ntion. First, we will see which notions in Arrow\u0092s result and proof generalize easily and\nwhat these generalizations look like. Second, where the translation leaves holes, we will see\nwhat extra conditions are needed to \u0085ll those holes. This will motivate some of the main\nconditions seen in the symposium and in the judgment-aggregation literature beyond.\nFor our purposes, we consider Arrow\u0092s theorem in the case in which all individual and\ncollective preferences are strict. The preference aggregation problem can then be sum-\nmarized as follows. Each individual i 2 N holds a preference order \u001fi (an asymmetric,\ntransitive and connected binary relation) over a set K = fx; y; z; :::g of alternatives. We\nare looking for a preference aggregation rule, F , that assigns to each pro\u0085le (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn)\nof individual preference orders a collective preference order \u001f. We require F to satisfy\nuniversal domain (every pro\u0085le of strict orders is admissible as input), collective rational-\nity (the output is a strict order), independence of irrelevant alternatives (the collective\npreference over any pair x; y 2 K depends only on individual preferences over that pair),\nand the weak Pareto principle (if everyone prefers x to y, then x is collectively preferred\nto y). Arrow\u0092s theorem states that, when jKj \u0015 3, only dictatorships satisfy these con-\nditions, i.e., there is some \u0085xed individual i 2 N such that, for every pro\u0085le (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn),\nF(\u001f1; :::;\u001fn) =\u001fi.\nThe intended generalization can be motivated by reinterpreting preferences as judg-\nments on special kinds of propositions. For instance, the preference order x \u001f y \u001f z\nencodes the judgments that x is preferable to y, y is preferable to z, and x is preferable to\nz. More generally, any preference order encodes a set of judgments on all binary ranking\npropositions of the form \u0091v is preferable to w\u0092, where v and w are distinct alternatives\nin K. Thus the agenda is the set X = fv \u001f w : v; w 2 K with v 6= wg. Judgment\nsets here are consistent and complete when these constraints are understood in terms of\nthe standard constraints on preferences. This reinterpretation of preferences as judgments\non binary ranking propositions raises the prospect of proving a result similar to Arrow\u0092s\ntheorem for more general agendas of propositions.\nWhat do Arrow\u0092s conditions on the aggregation rule look like in this general case? Uni-\n6\nversal domain becomes the condition that every pro\u0085le of consistent and complete judg-\nment sets is admissible as input to the aggregation rule. Collective rationality becomes\nthe condition that the output is a consistent and complete judgment set. The weak Pareto\nprinciple becomes the propositionwise unanimity principle, requiring that if everyone ac-\ncepts a proposition p within the agenda, then p is collectively accepted. And independence\nof irrelevant alternatives becomes the requirement \u0096here called independence \u0096that the\ncollective judgment on any proposition p within the agenda depend only on individual\njudgments on p. We want to know for which agendas of propositions dictatorships are the\nonly aggregation rules satisfying these conditions. This question is non-trivial, since we\ncan easily construct agendas for which non-dictatorial aggregation rules such as majority\nvoting work perfectly well. A simple example is X = fp;:pg.\nLet us revisit the key steps in the proof of Arrow\u0092s theorem and generalize them in\nturn. Throughout the proof, we assume that the aggregation rule satis\u0085es Arrow\u0092s four\nconditions, and our de\u0085nitions and lemmas take these conditions as given. Many classic\nproofs of the theorem consist of two lemmas: the \u0091contagion\u0092or \u0091\u0085eld-expansion\u0092lemma\nand the \u0091group-contraction\u0092lemma. Both make use of the fact that, under independence\nof irrelevant alternatives, a preference aggregation rule can be represented in terms of its\n\u0091winning coalitions\u0092, as de\u0085ned in a moment.\n3.1 The contagion or \u0085eld-expansion lemma\nThe literature contains several versions of the \u0085rst lemma, which refer to weaker or stronger\nnotions of \u0091decisiveness\u0092. We write K\u00026=K to denote the set of all ordered pairs of distinct\nalternatives from K. Recall these standard de\u0085nitions from social choice theory.\nDe\u0085nition A group S \u0012 N is called almost decisive over the ordered pair (x; y) 2\nK \u00026= K if [x \u001fi y for all i 2 S; and y \u001fj x for all j 2 NnS] implies x \u001f y: A group that\nis almost decisive over all pairs in K \u00026= K is called almost decisive. For each pair (x; y),\nthe set of almost decisive groups over (x; y), denoted W(x;y), is called the set of winning\ncoalitions over (x; y).\nDe\u0085nition A group S \u0012 N is called decisive over the ordered pair (x; y) 2 K \u00026= K if\n[x \u001fi y for all i 2 S] implies x \u001f y: A group that is decisive over all pairs in K \u00026= K is\ncalled decisive. If a single individual i is decisive, then i is a dictator.\nThe di\u00a4erence between these two notions is that an almost decisive group wins if\neveryone outside the group opposes it, whereas a decisive group wins regardless of others\u0092\nsupport or opposition. Clearly, decisiveness implies almost decisiveness, and the two\nnotions are equivalent if we accept the monotonicity property that more \u0091votes\u0092in favor\nof a position cannot hurt collective acceptance of that position. Formally:\nDe\u0085nition An aggregation rule is monotonic if, for any (x; y) 2 K \u00026= K, the set of\nwinning coalitions is superset-closed: S \u0012 T \u0012 N and S 2 W(x;y) imply T 2 W(x;y).\nWhile monotonicity is natural in almost all social-choice and judgment-aggregation set-\ntings (when independence is satis\u0085ed), it is not always assumed and not required for\nArrow\u0092s theorem.\n7\nWe can now state three standard versions of the contagion lemma.6\nLemma 1 (Contagion) If the group S \u0012 N is\n(a) almost decisive over some (x; y) 2 K \u00026= K, then S is almost decisive.\n(b) decisive over some (x; y) 2 K \u00026= K, then S is decisive.\n(c) almost decisive over some (x; y) 2 K \u00026= K, then S is decisive.\nNotice that the third version is stronger in that it converts almost decisiveness into deci-\nsiveness. The proofs of these three claims are very similar, but it turns out that, when we\ntranslate to general judgment-aggregation problems, small di\u00a4erences matter.\nProof sketch. For now, let us focus on contagion from the pair (x; y) to the pair\n(x; z) for all z 2 K. Consider preference pro\u0085les that are consistent with Table 2 (for the\nmoment, ignoring the \u0085rst row).\np Y :q\nx \u001fi y y \u001fi z z \u001fi x\ni 2 S X X \u0002\ni 2 NnS \u0000 X \u0000\nTable 2: A pro\u0085le in the proof of the contagion lemma\nThe \u0091\u0000\u0092in the \u0085rst and third columns for row \u0091i 2 NnS\u0092means that these preferences\nhave not yet been speci\u0085ed. That is, everyone prefers y to z, and everyone in S prefers\nx to y and x to z. By independence, the collective preference between x and z can only\ndepend on individual preferences over this pair.\nTowards showing (a): Suppose that S is almost decisive over (x; y) but not almost\ndecisive over (x; z). Then, since everyone in S prefers x to z, if everyone in NnS prefers z\nto x, z must also be collectively preferred to x. But consider pro\u0085les in which everyone in\nNnS has preferences y \u001fi z \u001fi x (that is, their row reads [\u0002;X;X]). In this case, since S\nis almost decisive on (x; y), x is collectively preferred to y; and since everyone prefers y to\nz, y is collectively preferred to z, by the weak Pareto principle. Therefore, by transitivity,\nx is collectively preferred to z, a contradiction.\nTowards showing (b): Suppose that S is decisive over (x; y) but not decisive over (x; z).\nThen, since everyone in S prefers x to z, there must exist a combination of preferences\nover x and z for those in NnS such that z is collectively preferred to x. But consider\npro\u0085les in which all those i 2 NnS with preference z \u001fi x (as before) have preferences\ny \u001fi z \u001fi x (their row reads [\u0002;X;X]); and all those i 2 NnS with preference x \u001fi z have\npreferences x \u001fi y \u001fi z (their row reads [X;X;\u0002]). In this case, since S is decisive on\n(x; y), x is collectively preferred to y; and since everyone prefers y to z, y is collectively\npreferred to z, by the weak Pareto principle. Therefore, by transitivity, x is collectively\npreferred to z, a contradiction.\nTowards showing (c): Suppose that S is almost decisive over (x; y) but not decisive\nover (x; z). Then, since everyone in S prefers x to z, there must exist a combination\n6The \u0085rst of these used to be in the standard textbook proof. For example, it is the version in Mas-\nColell et al. [39]. The second emerged in Sen [59] and is now perhaps standard. For example, it is used in\nCampbell and Kelly\u0092s chapter on Arrovian impossibility theorems in the Handbook of Social Choice and\nWelfare [4]. The third, stronger version comes from the classic treatment in Sen [58].\n8\nof preferences over x and z for those in NnS such that z is collectively preferred to x.\nBut consider pro\u0085les in which all those i 2 NnS with preference z \u001fi x (as before) have\npreferences y \u001fi z \u001fi x (their row reads [\u0002;X;X]); and all those i 2 NnS with preference\nx \u001fi z have preferences y \u001fi x \u001fi z (their row reads [\u0002;X;\u0002]). In this case, since S is\nalmost decisive on (x; y), x is collectively preferred to y; and since everyone prefers y to\nz, y is collectively preferred to z, by the weak Pareto principle. Therefore, by transitivity,\nx is collectively preferred to z, a contradiction.\nSimilar steps show contagion from the pair (x; y) to the pair (w; y) for all w 2 X; and\nputting these and similar steps together yields the desired conclusions. \u0003\n3.2 Generalizing the contagion lemma\nLet us deconstruct this proof, translate each piece to a general judgment-aggregation set-\nting, and see if we arrive at the building blocks of an analogous lemma. Following our\nassumption in the case of preferences, we assume that the judgment aggregation rule satis-\n\u0085es the generalized versions of Arrow\u0092s four conditions; again, our de\u0085nitions and lemmas\ntake these conditions as given. First let us translate the notions of decisiveness. As in\nthe case of preference aggregation, any judgment aggregation rule satisfying independence\ncan be represented in terms of its winning coalitions.\nDe\u0085nition A group S \u0012 N is called almost decisive over the proposition p 2 X if [p 2 Ji\nfor all i 2 S; and p =2 Ji for all j 2 NnS] implies p 2 F (J1; :::; Jn): A group that is almost\ndecisive over all propositions in X is called almost decisive. For each p, the set of almost\ndecisive groups over p, denoted Wp, is called the set of winning coalitions over p.\nDe\u0085nition A group S \u0012 N is called decisive over the proposition p 2 X if [p 2 Ji for\nall i 2 S] implies p 2 F (J1; :::; Jn): A group that is decisive over all propositions in X is\ncalled decisive. If a single individual i is decisive, then i is a dictator.\nWe will highlight three pieces of the argument.\n(1) Conditional entailment. In each of (a), (b) and (c), we \u0091leveraged\u0092a collective\npreference for x over y to a collective preference for x over z using unanimity about\n(y; z) as the fulcrum. This works because, conditional on a collective preference for y\nover z, a collective preference for x over y entails a collective preference for x over z,\nsince the converse, z \u001f x, would be inconsistent with transitivity. Intransitivity is the\nmain notion of inconsistency in preference-aggregation settings. But we can translate the\nnotion of conditional entailment to any judgment-aggregation setting using that setting\u0092s\nown notion of what is inconsistent or infeasible. Indeed, something close to the following\nnotion is found in most papers in the symposium.\nDe\u0085nition Proposition p conditionally entails proposition q, written p `\u0003 q, if there\nis a (possibly empty) subset Y of the agenda X such that fpg [ Y [ f:qg is a minimal\ninconsistent set and (for non-triviality) p 6= :q.7\n7Recall that an inconsistent set is minimal if every proper subset is consistent. This implies that\nreplacing any individual proposition in the set with its negation produces a consistent set. In particular,\nin this case, this means that the conditioning set Y is consistent with p alone and with :q alone.\n9\nIn the setting above, the minimal inconsistent set consists of p := (x \u001f y), Y := (y \u001f z)\nand :q := (z \u001f x), or [X;X;X] in Table 2. Thus, p conditionally entails q: Given unanim-\nity on (y \u001f z), if (x \u001f y) is collectively accepted, then (x \u001f z) must also be collectively\naccepted. More generally, Y need not be singleton but could be another set of propositions\n(possibly even empty). In the example from our opening section, p := \u0091CO2 emissions are\nabove a given threshold\u0092, Y := \u0091if CO2 emissions are above that threshold, then there will\nbe a critical temperature increase\u0092, and :q := \u0091there will not be a critical temperature\nincrease\u0092. Here, again, p conditionally entails q: Given unanimity about the temperature-\nincreasing e\u00a4ects of emissions above the threshold, if the panel judges that emissions are\nabove that threshold, then it must also judge that there will be a temperature increase.\nThus, in general settings, if p entails q conditional on some (possibly empty) set of\npropositions Y , we can always leverage a collective judgment in support of p to a collective\njudgment in support of q using unanimous acceptance of every proposition in Y as the\nfulcrum (see the top row of Table 2, where a X in the Y column is read as acceptance of\nevery proposition in Y ).\n(2) Using consistent individual pro\u0085les to obtain a contradiction. Each lever-\nage argument involved constructing particular pro\u0085les of individual preferences and using\nthese to obtain a contradiction. In particular, we constructed pro\u0085les for those individuals\noutside the group S over (x; y) and (x; z). For this step to work, the constructed prefer-\nences had to be consistent (in particular, with the assumed unanimous preference for y\nover z). For part (a), we used the preferences y \u001fi z \u001fi x, or [\u0002;X;X], for all in NnS. For\n(b), we used these preferences again and also x \u001fi y \u001fi z, or [X;X;\u0002]. These were both\nconsistent preferences. In fact, in both cases, the constructed preferences di\u00a4ered from\nthe relevant minimal inconsistent set [X;X;X] (the preference cycle) in just one place.\nThe analogous argument in a general setting requires constructing pro\u0085les of individual\njudgments concerning p and :q where there is unanimity about every proposition in Y ,\nand where fpg [ Y [ f:qg is a minimal inconsistent set (again, see the top row of Table\n2). For parts (a) and (b), the analogous constructed judgments for NnS, [\u0002;X;X] and\n[X;X;\u0002], will again di\u00a4er from the minimal inconsistent set, [X;X;X], in just one place\nand hence, by minimality, they too must be consistent.\nIn part (c), however, we used the preferences y \u001fi x \u001fi z, or [\u0002;X;\u0002], to obtain\na contradiction. This di\u00a4ers from the relevant minimal inconsistent set [X;X;X] in two\nplaces. In the preference case, this was consistent, but in the general case, this step will\nonly translate if the relevant minimal inconsistent set, fpg [ Y [ f:qg, has the property\nthat the \u0091pair-negated\u0092variant f:pg [ Y [ fqg is itself consistent. More generally:\nDe\u0085nition A minimal inconsistent set Y 0 is pair-negatable if it has a subset of size two,\nsay fp0; q0g \u0012 Y 0, such that (Y 0n fp0; q0g) [ f:p0;:q0g is consistent.8 In our proof, p0 = p\nand q0 = :q.\nIn the preference example above, p0 := (x \u001f y), Y 0n fp0; q0g := (y \u001f z), q0 := (z \u001f x), and\n(Y 0n fp0; q0g) [ f:p0;:q0g can be summarized by the preferences y \u001fi x \u001fi z. Thus the\nminimal inconsistent set de\u0085ned by the preference cycle is indeed pair-negatable.\nRecall that part (c) of the lemma is not needed if the aggregation rule is assumed\nto satisfy monotonicity (since, then, almost decisiveness and decisiveness are equivalent).\n8 In general, the set Y 0n fp0; q0g could be empty.\n10\nBut without assuming monotonicity, to obtain decisiveness from almost decisiveness (i.e.,\nto obtain monotonicity), we need to assume the existence of at least one pair-negatable\nminimal inconsistent subset of the agenda. Indeed, all of the impossibility results in this\nsymposium that do not impose monotonicity assume a condition close to this.9\nThus, in general settings, if p entails q conditional on some Y \u0012 X, and S is almost\ndecisive (respectively decisive) on p, then S is almost decisive (respectively decisive) on q.\nIf, in addition, f:pg [ Y [ fqg is consistent, then S\u0092s almost decisiveness on p implies S\u0092s\ndecisiveness on q.\n(3) Connectedness and Total Blockedness. The last piece of the proof of the\nlemma involved repeating the leverage step using other potential inconsistencies with tran-\nsitivity. For example, the potential cycle w \u001f x, x \u001f y and y \u001f w is used to leverage\na collective preference for x over y to one for w over y using unanimity about (w; x) as\nthe fulcrum. Eventually this process reaches every ordered pair (w; z) 2 K \u00026= K. If we\ntranslate the argument to a general judgment-aggregation setting, we \u0085nd that, just as\na virus spreads from one individual to another along a network of infectious contacts, a\ngroup\u0092s decisiveness on some proposition p spreads to all other propositions that can be\nreached from p via a sequence of conditional entailments. That is, a group\u0092s decisiveness\ntravels across a directed graph of propositions connected by conditional entailments, each\nassociated with an appropriate minimal inconsistent set. Thus, the last extra condition\nneeded to extend the contagion lemma to a general setting is that this directed graph is\n(strongly) connected: The pattern of minimal inconsistent subsets of the agenda is such\nthat we can travel from any proposition to any other via a sequence of conditional entail-\nments. Indeed, this condition, introduced by Nehring and Puppe [47, 49], or something\nclose to it is found in all the symposium papers establishing impossibility results.\nDe\u0085nition An agenda X is totally blocked (sometimes also called path-connected) if,\nfor any pair of propositions p; q 2 X, there exists a sequence of propositions p1,...,pk 2 X\nsuch that p = p1 `\u0003 p2 `\u0003 ::: `\u0003 pk = q.\nPutting these translated pieces of the argument back together, using the two new\nconditions we have discovered, yields a new general contagion lemma.\nLemma 2 (General contagion) Suppose that the agenda is totally blocked. Then, if\nthe group S \u0012 N is:\n(a) almost decisive over some proposition p in the agenda, then S is almost decisive;\n(b) decisive over some proposition p in the agenda, then S is decisive.\n(c) almost decisive over some proposition p in the agenda and, in addition, the agenda\nhas at least one pair-negatable minimal inconsistent subset, then S is decisive.\nProof sketch. For parts (a) and (b), the proof follows from the discussion above.\nFor part (c), let S be almost decisive over some p. By (a), S is almost decisive over all\npropositions, including those that form a pair-negatable minimal inconsistent set (which\n9This is equivalent to the existence of an even-negatable minimal inconsistent subset of the agenda (i.e.,\nwhich has a subset of even size whose propositionwise negation makes the set consistent), introduced in\nDietrich [6] and Dietrich and List [9], and also to the algebraic condition of non-a\u00a2 neness, introduced in\nDokow and Holzman [23] in this symposium.\n11\nmust exist by assumption). Therefore, there exists at least one proposition over which S\nis decisive. By part (b), S is decisive. \u0003\nThis lemma has a couple of corollaries of independent interest. First, the lemma as\na whole tells us that if the agenda is totally blocked and has at least one pair-negatable\nminimal inconsistent subset, then the aggregation rule is monotonic. Second, part (a) on\nits own tells us that if an agenda is totally blocked, then the aggregation rule is neutral in\nthe sense that it aggregates judgments on each proposition in the same way.\nDe\u0085nition A judgment aggregation rule is neutral if, for all propositions in the agenda,\nthe set of winning coalitions is the same: Wp =Wq for all p; q 2 X. The strengthening of\nindependence by imposing neutrality is called systematicity.\nA similar de\u0085nition also applies to the case of preferences, with propositions replaced by\nordered pairs of distinct alternatives.\n3.3 The group-contraction lemma\nWe can now turn to the second lemma used to prove Arrow\u0092s theorem. It too comes in\nseveral forms, but we will just need one.10\nLemma 3 (Group contraction) Suppose the aggregation rule is neutral.\nThen there exists an individual who is almost decisive over some ordered pair (x; y) 2\nK \u00026= K.\nProof sketch. Suppose not. We already know that there exist almost decisive groups;\ne.g., N is such a group, by the weak Pareto principle. Among all groups that are almost\ndecisive over some pair, let S be among the smallest. Let (y; z) be a pair over which S is\nalmost decisive. Fix some j 2 S and consider preference pro\u0085les that are consistent with\nTable 3 (for now, ignoring the \u0085rst row).\np Y :q\nx \u001fi y y \u001fi z z \u001fi x\ni = j X X \u0002\ni 2 Snfjg \u0002 X X\ni 2 NnS X \u0002 X\nTable 3: A pro\u0085le in the proof of the group-contraction lemma\nThe groups NnS and Snfjg could be empty. Since Snfjg is smaller than S, it cannot\nbe almost decisive over (x; y), and thus x must be collectively preferred to y. Since S is\nalmost decisive on (y; z), y must be collectively preferred to z. Thus, by transitivity, x\nmust be collectively preferred to z, and hence j is almost decisive on (x; z). \u0003\nThe combination of the two lemmas yields Arrow\u0092s theorem: From part (a) of the\ncontagion lemma, we know that the aggregation rule is neutral. The group-contraction\nlemma then implies the existence of an almost decisive individual on some pair in K\u00026=K.\nBy part (c) of the contagion lemma, this individual is decisive over all pairs and hence a\ndictator. \u0003\n10This version is essentially the one in Sen [58].\n12\n3.4 Generalizing the group-contraction lemma\nAgain, let us try to translate this proof to a general judgment-aggregation setting. Once\nagain, the proof relies on conditional entailments (in fact, the same conditional entailment\nas before) and on constructing consistent pro\u0085les of individual preferences to induce a con-\ntradiction. A quick inspection of Table 3 con\u0085rms that each of the individual preferences\nused in the construction di\u00a4er from the relevant minimal inconsistent set, [X;X;X], in\njust one place. Thus, by the same argument as used above, the analogous pro\u0085le of indi-\nvidual judgments (see the top row of the table) will be consistent. There is, however, one\nslightly hidden assumption. Unlike in the proof of the general contagion lemma, the min-\nimal inconsistent set used here needs to have three elements: If Y were empty and fp;:qg\nwere itself a minimal inconsistent set, then the judgments held by the individuals in NnS\nwould be inconsistent. Therefore, the analogous lemma requires the following additional\nproperty on the agenda (which, it is easy to check, is implied by total blockedness).\nDe\u0085nition An agenda X is non-simple if it has a minimal inconsistent subset with three\nor more elements.\nAdding this extra condition yields the following straightforward generalization of the\ngroup contraction lemma.\nLemma 4 (General group contraction) Suppose that the agenda is non-simple and\nthe aggregation rule is neutral. Then there exists an individual who is almost decisive over\nsome proposition p.\nThe proof follows immediately from the discussion above.\n3.5 The theorem\nWe can now state the analogue of Arrow\u0092s theorem in judgment aggregation.\nTheorem 1 (a) If the agenda is totally blocked and has at least one pair-negatable min-\nimal inconsistent subset, the only aggregation rules satisfying universal domain, con-\nsistency and completeness, the unanimity principle and independence are the dicta-\ntorships.\n(b) If the agenda does not have both of these properties and jN j \u0015 3, there exist non-\ndictatorial aggregation rules satisfying the speci\u0085ed conditions.\nProof sketch. Part (a) follows immediately from the general contagion and contrac-\ntion lemmas. Its converse (b) (for jN j \u0015 3) is established through explicit examples, as\nshown in Nehring and Puppe [49] (for the violation of total blockedness) and Dokow and\nHolzman [23] (for the violation of the pair-negatability property). \u0003\nThe literature contains several variants of this theorem. Dokow and Holzman [23], in\nthis symposium, proved both parts. Part (a) alone was also proved by Dietrich and List\n[9]. Both of these works build on Nehring and Puppe\u0092s earlier variant [49], also in this\nsymposium, in which monotonicity is additionally imposed on the aggregation rule but\nthe agenda condition of pair-negatability is not required. Recall that, with monotonicity,\n13\nalmost decisiveness implies decisiveness, and hence part (c) of the general contagion lemma\nis not needed. Nehring and Puppe [49] and Dietrich and List [9] further considered the\ncase in which the aggregation rule is required to be neutral (i.e., independence is strength-\nened to systematicity). Here total blockedness can be weakened to non-simplicity and the\ngeneral contagion lemma is not needed (apart from a variant of part (c) in the case with-\nout monotonicity, to get from almost decisiveness to decisiveness, using pair-negatability).\nInterestingly, with neutrality, the unanimity principle becomes largely redundant.11 Pre-\ncursors of the result with neutrality, under more restrictive agenda assumptions, include\nthe impossibility results by List and Pettit [36] and Pauly and van Hees [52].12\nThe two lemmas underlying the proof above can be found in various places in this\nsymposium and elsewhere. In essence, part (a) of the general contagion lemma occurs in\nDokow and Holzman [23] and Dietrich and List [9], and an adapted version also occurs\nin Dietrich and Mongin\u0092s symposium paper [20], discussed below. The conclusion of part\n(b) is similar to that of Nehring and Puppe\u0092s contagion lemma [49], but the argument is\ndi\u00a4erent. They use what they call the \u0091intersection property\u0092, whereas the proof above\ncan be traced back to classical social choice theory. The conclusion of part (c) and its use\nof pair-negatability can also be found in Dokow and Holzman [23] and Dietrich and List\n[9], though they each give a separate argument that the pair-negatability property (\u0091non-\na\u00a2 neness\u0092in Dokow and Holzman) yields monotonicity of the aggregation rule. However,\npart (c) in the present form, deriving full decisiveness from almost decisiveness on a single\nproposition, is not commonly used in the judgment-aggregation literature.\nThe general group-contraction lemma essentially occurs in Dokow and Holzman [23].\nOther papers, including Dietrich and List [9] and Dietrich and Mongin [20], replace it\nby a two-step argument proving, \u0085rst, that the set of winning coalitions is intersection-\nclosed and, secondly, that the intersection of all winning coalitions is singleton. This proof\nstrategy resembles those proofs of Arrow\u0092s theorem which show that the set of winning\ncoalitions forms an \u0091ultra-\u0085lter\u0092.13 We return to this point when we discuss relaxations of\nthe completeness requirement on collective judgments.\nHow demanding are the agenda conditions of Theorem 1? Total blockedness turns\nout to be quite strong. While it is paradigmatically satis\u0085ed by the agenda of pairwise\npreference rankings over three or more alternatives, some of our other illustrative agendas\nviolate it. In the law-court example, where p and q are the premises for liability and r\nis the proposition about liability (subject to r $ (p ^ q)), total blockedness is violated\n(e.g., there is no sequence of conditional entailments from the proposition that he did\nnot do it to the proposition that he is liable). Indeed, unanimity voting on each of p,\nq and r (with :p;:q and :r being the \u0091default\u0092judgments in the absence of unanimity)\nsatis\u0085es all of the Arrovian conditions. In the expert-panel example, where the agenda\nconsists of p, p ! q, q and their negations, total blockedness is again violated, and a\nnon-dictatorial aggregation rule satisfying the speci\u0085ed conditions is given by accepting p\nif it is unanimously accepted and accepting each of p! q and q unless it is unanimously\n11 In the neutral case, even without the unanimity principle, the other conditions imply either (i) dicta-\ntorship \u0096when the agenda has at least one inconsistent subset whose propositionwise negation is consistent\n(Dietrich [6]) \u0096or (ii) the disjunction of dictatorship and inverse dictatorship (Dietrich and List [9]).\n12Under stronger agenda assumptions, Pauly and van Hees [52] and Dietrich [5] also proved impossibility\nresults without neutrality in which the unanimity principle is weakened to the requirement that the ag-\ngregation rule be non-constant. For other discussions of the relationship between preference and judgment\naggregation, see also List and Pettit [37] and Nehring [43].\n13See, for example, Campbell and Kelly [4] and references therein.\n14\nrejected (with \u0091default\u0092judgments :p, p! q and q otherwise).\nHowever, despite the demandingness of total blockedness, we can gain important in-\nsights from the role played by conditional entailments in making decisiveness contagious.\nIn particular, whenever we can get from p to q via a sequence of conditional entailments,\nany winning coalition for p must also be winning for q; and, further, whenever the agenda\ncontains a strongly connected segment, the aggregation rule must be neutral within that\nsegment. In this way, the structure of conditional entailments within the agenda severely\nrestricts the class of admissible aggregation rules, sometimes forcing them to be locally\ndictatorial, oligarchic or subject to individual veto power. Many of these results, along\nwith a general family of \u0091blockedness\u0092conditions, are in Nehring and Puppe [49] in this\nsymposium.

The rows and\ncolumns indicate the conditions imposed on the aggregation rule, and the corresponding\nentries show the classes of agendas for which any such rule must be a dictatorship.\n4 Escape routes from impossibility\nAs noted in our opening remarks, the most important contribution of the impossibility re-\nsults on judgment aggregation, as in preference aggregation, is not so much to demonstrate\nthat there are no compelling aggregation rules, but to give us insights into which require-\nments on aggregation must be relaxed to \u0085nd such rules. The generalization of Arrow\u0092s\ntheorem points to four di\u00a4erent escape routes from the impossibility of non-dictatorial\njudgment aggregation.\nThe \u0085rst three correspond to the three types of constraints on aggregation mentioned\nat the beginning. We can restrict the domain of admissible inputs to the aggregation rule;\nrelax the constraints on the outputs; or weaken the informational restrictions imposed by\nindependence (we set aside the less compelling route of dropping \u0091democratic\u0092conditions\nsuch as the unanimity principle or monotonicity). The fourth route uses the fact that,\nunlike Arrow\u0092s theorem, which applies to all non-trivial preference aggregation problems\n15\n(i.e., all with more than two alternatives), its generalization does not apply to all agendas\nof substantive interest. We can thus focus on agendas that are substantively interesting but\nfall outside the \u0091problematic\u0092classes leading to dictatorship. While the \u0085rst three routes\ngeneralize familiar responses to Arrow\u0092s theorem, the last exploits the additional structure\nthat can be introduced by the move from preference aggregation to judgment-aggregation\nsettings.\n4.1 Restricting the domain\nThe impossibility theorem we have discussed takes the aggregation rule to be de\u0085ned on\nthe domain of all pro\u0085les of consistent and complete judgment sets and thus places no\nrestriction on the admissible disagreement between individuals. However, it is sometimes\nreasonable to expect individual judgments to fall into a more restricted domain, which cap-\ntures greater agreement or cohesion among individuals. The symposium paper by Dietrich\nand List [16], building on List [32], asks whether there are plausible domain restrictions\nthat guarantee that propositionwise majority judgments are consistent. Dietrich and List\nidentify several such restrictions, which can be partially ordered by strength. They are\nsimilar in spirit to some classic domain restrictions in preference aggregation (such as\nsingle-peakedness) and generalize some of them, thereby shedding light on which abstract\nfeatures of those classic conditions are responsible for their e\u00a4ects on majority consistency.\nWe here review some examples, beginning with the \u0085rst and strongest domain-restriction\ncondition in judgment aggregation, called unidimensional alignment (List [32]). It is based\non the idea that judgments are constrained by the individuals\u0092location on some left-right\naxis, which represents their positions on some cognitive or normative dimension. A pro\u0085le\n(J1; :::; Jn) is unidimensionally aligned if the individuals in N can be ordered from left to\nright such that, for every proposition p in the agenda, the individuals accepting p (i.e.,\nthose with p 2 Ji) are either all to the left, or all to the right, of those rejecting it (i.e.,\nthose with p =2 Ji). For example, consider the agenda containing the following propositions\nand their negations:\np: \u0091A budget de\u0085cit is acceptable.\u0092\nq: \u0091We should increase defense spending.\u0092\np! q: \u0091If a budget de\u0085cit is acceptable, we should increase defense spending.\u0092\nPlausibly, individuals on the left of the political spectrum \u0085nd a budget de\u0085cit accept-\nable, while those on the right do not; those on the right endorse an increase in defense\nspending, while those on the left do not; and everyone from the center to the right shares\nthe view that, at least conditional on the acceptability of a budget de\u0085cit, defense spend-\ning should be increased. The result is a unidimensionally aligned pro\u0085le, as illustrated in\nTable 5.\nInd. 1 Ind. 2 Ind. 3 Ind. 4 Ind. 5\np X X \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\np! q \u0002 \u0002 X X X\nq \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 X X\nTable 5: A unidimensionally aligned pro\u0085le\nWhen this condition is satis\u0085ed, any proposition in the agenda is accepted by a ma-\njority if and only if it is accepted by the median individual on the given left-right order\n16\n(ignoring ties). Thus, in the present example, the majority judgments coincide with those\nof individual 3. But then the majority judgments inherit the consistency of the median\nindividual\u0092s judgments, given individual consistency. Applied to binary preference rank-\nings, unidimensional alignment reduces to the established condition of order-restriction\n(Rothstein [55]), which has single-crossing as a special case.\nDietrich and List [16] generalize this condition in several ways. They also show that\nthe left-right order of individuals producing the required acceptance-rejection patterns\nneed not be the same for all propositions in the agenda, but can vary across di\u00a4erent sub-\nagendas. For instance, majority judgments are also consistent if the individual judgments\nrestricted to the propositions in each minimal inconsistent subset of the agenda (and their\nnegations) are unidimensionally aligned. This \u0091localization\u0092 of the domain restrictions\nresembles a familiar move in preference aggregation, where Condorcet cycles are already\nruled out by requiring restrictions such as single-peakedness to hold for every triple of\nalternatives.\nIn preference aggregation, majority consistency can also be assured by a weaker local\ncondition known as value-restriction (Sen [57]): In every triple of alternatives, the indi-\nviduals unanimously rank one alternative not top, not middle, or not bottom. Dietrich\nand List show how to generalize this condition to judgment aggregation and give it an\nalternative form: Any minimal inconsistent set Y \u0012 X contains a pair of propositions p; q\nnot jointly accepted by anyone. To see why this generalizes Sen\u0092s condition, notice that if\neveryone agrees, for instance, that y is not middle among x, y and z, no-one will jointly\naccept x \u001f y and y \u001f z. While weaker than the earlier domain-restriction conditions, this\nis still su\u00a2 cient for majority consistency: If the majority judgments were inconsistent,\nat least one minimal inconsistent set Y \u0012 X would have to be majority-accepted. But\nthen the pair of propositions p; q 2 Y from the de\u0085nition of value-restriction would be\nmajority-accepted as well, and at least one individual i 2 N would have to accept both,\ncontradicting value-restriction.\nWhether value-restriction can be relaxed further depends on whether we wish to for-\nmulate domain restrictions as constraints on admissible individual judgment sets or as con-\nstraints on admissible pro\u0085les. In the former case (\u0091product domains\u0092), value-restriction\ncannot generally be relaxed further. In the latter case (\u0091non-product domains\u0092), a weaker\nnecessary and su\u00a2 cient condition for majority consistency can be given. Unlike unidi-\nmensional alignment or value-restriction, it speci\u0085es not only which patterns within each\nindividual\u0092s judgment set are or are not permitted to occur, but also how often those pat-\nterns may occur across the pro\u0085le: For every minimal inconsistent subset of the agenda, at\nleast one proposition must be majority-rejected, the veri\u0085cation of which requires explicit\ncounting.\n4.2 Relaxing the constraints on the outputs\nInstead of restricting the domain of inputs to the aggregation rule, we can also relax\nthe constraints on its outputs. The impossibility theorem above requires the aggregation\nrule to generate a complete, not just consistent, collective judgment set for every pro\u0085le\nof individual judgment sets. But there are many contexts in which completeness seems\ntoo much to ask of collective judgments; we may be able to agree or at least resolve our\ndisagreements on some issues while agreeing to disagree on others.\nTwo natural kinds of aggregation rules violating completeness are unanimity rules and\n17\nsupermajority rules (List and Pettit [36]).14 The former accept any proposition (likewise,\nits negation) collectively if and only if it is accepted by all individuals; the latter, if and only\nif it is accepted by a su\u00a2 ciently large supermajority, such as two thirds, three quarters, or\nmore. In both cases, no judgment is made when neither the proposition nor its negation\nreceives the required support. An important di\u00a4erence between the two kinds of rules\nlies in the rationality conditions on collective judgments they secure. Notice that when\na judgment set is consistent and complete, it is also deductively closed : Any proposition\nin the agenda that is logically entailed by the given judgment set is also contained in\nit. In the expert-panel example, the set fp; p ! q; qg is deductively closed, while the set\nfp; p ! qg is not. Accordingly, when we relax completeness, we must choose whether or\nnot to preserve deductive closure. Since the intersection of several deductively closed sets\nof propositions is still deductively closed, unanimity rules guarantee deductive closure;\nsupermajority rules do not.\nPhilosophers are divided on whether deductive closure is a reasonable requirement of\nrationality. On the one hand, the acceptance of any given set of propositions may be taken\nto commit someone to the acceptance of its implications. On the other hand, it may be\ncomputationally di\u00a2 cult to identify these implications, and the evidential support avail-\nable for any set of propositions need not carry over to its implications. In the case of strict\npreference rankings, the conjunction of consistency and deductive closure is equivalent to\nthe conjunction of asymmetry and transitivity, and consistency by itself is equivalent to\nacyclicity.\nDokow and Holzman [24], in this symposium, and Dietrich and List [13] investigate\nthe general case in which completeness is dropped but deductive closure is preserved,\nstrengthening related results by G\u00e4rdenfors [26]. The key \u0085nding is that the dictatorship\nresult discussed above then turns into an oligarchy result. If (and, for jN j \u0015 3, only if)\nthe agenda is totally blocked and has at least one pair-negatable minimal inconsistent\nsubset, the only aggregation rules generating consistent and deductively closed collective\njudgments and satisfying Theorem 1\u0092s other conditions are the oligarchies: There exists\na \u0085xed non-empty subset M \u0012 N such that, for every pro\u0085le (J1; :::; Jn) in the domain,\nF (J1; :::; Jn) =\nT\ni2M\nJi. Unanimity rules are the limiting cases in which the set of \u0091oligarchs\u0092\nM contains everyone. Dictatorships are the opposite limiting cases in whichM is singleton.\nTo see why this oligarchy result holds, notice that the general contagion lemma above\ncontinues to hold even under the present weakening of the output constraints. In partic-\nular, the aggregation rule is still neutral and monotonic under the given conditions (i.e.,\nthe set of winning coalitions is the same across the agenda and superset-closed). The\ngroup-contraction lemma, by contrast, ceases to hold and must be replaced by another\nargument. As in the ultra-\u0085lter proofs of Arrow\u0092s theorem, the set of winning coalitions\ncan be shown to be intersection-closed. However, without completeness, the intersection\nof all winning coalitions need no longer be singleton, but can be a larger set M \u0012 N ,\nwhich consists precisely of the oligarchs. When applied to binary preference rankings, this\noligarchy theorem becomes a variant of Gibbard\u0092s classic oligarchy result for the case of\nquasi-transitive collective preferences (see Sen [58]). Dokow and Holzman [24] and Diet-\nrich and List [13] show further that this oligarchy result continues to hold if completeness\nis weakened to deductive closure not only on the output side but also on the input side of\n14A third kind is given by the \u0091conclusion-based\u0092rules that deliver judgments only on conclusions, but\nnot on premises.\n18\nthe aggregation rule.\nIf we give up deductive closure, non-oligarchic possibilities open up. For example,\nlet each proposition in the agenda be collectively accepted whenever it is accepted by\na supermajority of more than k\u00001k of the individuals, where k is the size of the largest\nminimal inconsistent subset of the agenda. The resulting collective judgments are always\nconsistent (Dietrich and List [10], extending List and Pettit [36]). The reason is that\nk or fewer supermajorities of this size must have a non-empty intersection, and so the\nsupermajority judgments on any set of k or fewer propositions inherit their consistency\nfrom the judgments of the individuals in this intersection. Thus no minimal inconsistent\nset, and by implication no other inconsistent set, can be accepted.\nSupermajority rules implement di\u00a4erent criteria for the acceptance and the rejection of\neach proposition; it is harder to accept a proposition than to reject it. Dietrich and List [19]\nshow that such an asymmetry is necessary for the avoidance of dictatorship, even when the\nonly requirement on judgment sets is consistency. Whenever the agenda is non-simple and\ncannot be partitioned into two logically independent sub-agendas, the only aggregation\nrules mapping pro\u0085les of consistent individual judgments to consistent collective ones\nsatisfying a condition of acceptance-rejection neutrality (requiring symmetrical treatment\nof acceptance and rejection of each proposition) are dictatorships.15\n4.3 Relaxing independence\nA third escape-route from impossibility is to relax propositionwise independence. In prefer-\nence aggregation, independence of irrelevant alternatives is usually defended by appealing\nto strategy-proofness. A defense of independence by appealing to non-manipulability can\nalso be given in some judgment-aggregation settings (Dietrich and List [11], Nehring and\nPuppe [47, 49]). But even when we ignore strategic issues, we usually want a court\u0092s\ncollective judgment on the factual question of whether the defendant did it to be indepen-\ndent of individuals\u0092judgments on the legal question of whether he was obliged not to do\nit. However, it seems less natural (on normative or, absent cynicism, strategic grounds)\nto require the court\u0092s collective judgment on the defendant\u0092s liability to be independent\nof the individuals\u0092judgments on whether he did it or whether he was obliged not to. If\nwe relax independence, several interesting classes of aggregation rules become available.\nThe most widely discussed one, the class of premise-based rules, is the topic of Dietrich\nand Mongin\u0092s symposium paper [20]. These rules go back, under the name issue-by-issue\nvoting, to Kornhauser and Sager\u0092s work in a legal context [30, 31, 29], where they were\ncontrasted with conclusion-based rules, or case-by-case voting, and more formally to List\nand Pettit [36], Bovens and Rabinowicz [2], Dietrich [5] and others.\nThe basic idea is to designate a subset of the agenda as a set of premises and to\naggregate judgments on them by some propositionwise independent rule, but to allow the\ncollective judgments on all other propositions (the conclusions) to depend on the resulting\ncollective judgments on these premises. In the court setting, the issues of whether he did\nit and whether he ought not to have done it might be thought of as the premises, and we\nmight decide these, for example, by majority voting. The issue of liability might be thought\nof as the conclusion, and we might decide this, for example, by the rule that the defendant\nis liable if and only if we collectively judge that he did it and ought not to have done\n15Acceptance-rejection neutrality is related to neutrality within issues or unbiasedness, discussed in\nNehring and Puppe [49] in this symposium and Dietrich and List [18].\n19\nso. (Conclusion-based rules, by contrast, apply a propositionwise independent aggregation\nrule directly on the conclusions.) Earlier contributions have usually assumed logically\nindependent premises \u0096 ideally chosen so as to constitute a logical basis for the entire\nagenda, so that their adjudication settles all other propositions \u0096and have focused mainly\non majority voting on these premises. Dietrich and Mongin [20] generalize the notion of a\npremise-based aggregation rule by de\u0085ning it in terms of two properties: propositionwise\nindependence restricted to the premises and unanimity preservation also restricted to the\npremises. This permits, among other things, logically interdependent premises.\nDietrich and Mongin use this framework to generalize the so-called doctrinal paradox,\nthe fact that premise-based and conclusion-based rules can deliver di\u00a4erent outcomes. Just\nas Dietrich and Mongin de\u0085ne premise-based rules in terms of two weak properties, they\nde\u0085ne conclusion-based rules in terms of the weak requirement of unanimity preservation\non all non-premises. Putting these two de\u0085nitions together, they identify the class of\nagendas for which premise-based and conclusion-based aggregation are in con\u0087ict, i.e., for\nwhich only dictatorships meet both requirements (under universal domain, consistency\nand completeness). The identi\u0085ed agenda conditions generalize the agenda conditions of\nTheorem 1 and reduce to them when the premise set is the entire agenda. The bottom\nline is that, in many contexts, to solve the doctrinal paradox one must choose between\nprivileging premises and privileging conclusions. Earlier related results were given by\nMongin [42] and Nehring [45].\nAnother class of aggregation rules that give up independence is the class of sequential\npriority rules (List [33]). Any such rule is de\u0085ned relative to a particular order of priority\namong the propositions in the agenda X. For each pro\u0085le (J1; :::; Jn), the propositions in\nX are then considered one-by-one in the speci\u0085ed order and the collective judgment on\neach proposition p is made as follows. If the majority judgment on p (or the judgment\nmade by some other propositionwise criterion) is consistent with the collective judgments\non propositions considered earlier, then that judgment becomes the collective judgment\non p; but if it is inconsistent with those earlier judgments, then the collective judgment\non p is determined by the implications of those earlier judgments. In the expert-panel\nexample of Table 1 above, the propositions might be considered in the order p, p ! q,\nq (with negations interspersed), which would lead to the acceptance of p and p ! q by\nmajority voting and the acceptance of q by logical inference.\nJust as the collective judgments produced by any premise-based rule depend on which\npropositions are chosen as the premises, the collective judgments produced by a sequen-\ntial priority rule depend on the order in which propositions are considered. Sometimes\nthere may be a natural choice of premises, or a natural order of priority, as in the court\nexample, but often there can be reasonable disagreement about which propositions should\nbe considered prior to others. The problem of majority inconsistency thus resurfaces as a\nproblem of path-dependence (List [33]).\nA third class of aggregation rules that are possible without independence is the class\nof distance-based rules (Pigozzi [54], Miller and Osherson [41]), originally introduced in\nthe area of belief merging in computer science (Konieczny and Pino P\u00e9rez [28]). Any\nsuch rule is de\u0085ned relative to a particular distance metric between judgment sets. An\nexample is the Hamming distance, which de\u0085nes the distance between any two judgment\nsets J; J 0 \u0012 X as the number of propositions in the agenda on which J and J 0 disagree,\ni.e., d(J; J 0) = jfp 2 X : p 2 J < p 2 J 0gj. The aggregation rule then maps each\npro\u0085le (J1; :::; Jn) to a consistent and complete collective judgment set J that minimizes\n20\nthe total distance from the individual judgment sets,\nP\ni2N\nd(J; Ji). Distance-based rules\ncapture the idea of reaching a compromise between di\u00a4erent individuals\u0092judgment sets. If\nthe Hamming distance is used, they further have the property of delivering the majority\njudgments whenever these are consistent. Applied to binary preference rankings, this\nHamming rule reduces to what is known as the Kemeny rule.\nTo analyze the possibilities opened up by relaxing independence more systematically,\nDietrich [7] introduces a condition of independence of irrelevant information de\u0085ned in\nterms of a relevance relation between propositions. An aggregation rule satis\u0085es this con-\ndition if and only if the collective judgment on each proposition depends only on individual\njudgments on propositions deemed \u0091relevant\u0092to it. The condition reduces to the standard\nindependence condition when each proposition is deemed relevant only to itself, but, for\nexample, the kind of dependency structure we \u0085nd in premise-based rules can also be\ncaptured: premises are deemed relevant to conclusions, but nothing is deemed relevant to\nany premise except that premise itself. Similarly, a sequential priority rule corresponds\nto a relevance relation that takes the form of a linear order over the propositions; and a\ndistance-based rule corresponds to one where every proposition is relevant to every other.\nDietrich\u0092s framework allows us to explore how the logical structure of the agenda, the\nrelevance relation and the conditions on aggregation jointly determine the space of possi-\nbilities. However, while aggregation rules that give up independence have some attractive\nproperties, their drawback can be shown to be manipulability, both by strategic voting\n(Dietrich and List [11], Nehring and Puppe [47, 49]) and by strategic agenda setting (List\n[33], Dietrich [5]).\n4.4 Focusing on special agendas\nAs noted, total blockedness is a demanding condition on the interconnectedness between\npropositions that is by no means satis\u0085ed in all judgment-aggregation settings of interest.\nSeveral papers in the literature look at natural agendas that are not totally blocked,\nand ask whether any of the aggregation rules that become possible here are also plausible.\nWhile we have already considered non-independent rules that exploit a special structure of\nthe agenda by prioritizing some propositions over others \u0096e.g., \u0091premises\u0092over \u0091conclusions\u0092\n\u0096our focus is now on aggregation rules that retain propositionwise independence.\nConsider again the class of agendas that permit a natural division between a set of\nissues that are the \u0091criteria\u0092for a particular decision and a single issue that is the \u0091decision\u0092\nitself: In the court example, the \u0091decision\u0092is whether or not the defendant is liable, and\nthe \u0091criteria\u0092are whether or not he did it and whether or not he was obliged not to do it.\nAnother example could be our academic hiring committee if a decision is made only on one\ncandidate, but the committee must also form collective judgments on several criteria that\nthe candidate might or might not satisfy: say, whether her ability is su\u00a2 cient, whether her\n\u0085eld of expertise \u0085ts departmental needs, and so on. In the cleanest such examples, there\nare no (non-trivial) logical connections between the criteria except those that run via the\ndecision; that is, any combination of judgments on the criteria alone is consistent (provided\nno proposition-negation pair is accepted). We can then summarize the constraints on the\nproblem by asking which combinations of judgments on the criteria force the decision to\ngo one way, say, \u0091acceptance\u0092; and which force it to go the other, say, \u0091rejection\u0092. Following\nNehring and Puppe [50] in the symposium, call the former set of combinations of judgments\non the criteria the acceptance region; and the latter set the rejection region.\n21\nIn some cases, the acceptance and rejection regions exactly partition the set of possible\n(complete and consistent) judgments on the criteria; that is, if all of the criteria are settled,\nthen a particular decision is entailed. These cases are called truth-functional. For example,\nin the court case, the defendant is liable if and only if he did it and he was obliged not to do\nit. Nehring and Puppe [48] and Dokow and Holzman [21] analyze truth-functional agendas\nlike these. Nehring and Puppe [48] show that, for such agendas, given the other Arrovian\nconditions (including independence) plus monotonicity, dictatorship can be avoided if and\nonly if either the acceptance or the rejection region contains essentially only a single\ncombination of judgments on the criteria.16 For example, in the court case, the acceptance\nregion contains only the combination of criterion-judgments \u0091he did it\u0092and \u0091he was obliged\nnot to do it\u0092. Even in cases like these, the only possible aggregation rules are oligarchic\nwith default : There is a particular (consistent and complete) default judgment set J0 \u001a X\nand a non-empty set of oligarchs M \u0012 N such that any collective departure from the\ndefault judgment in J0 requires unanimous consent among the oligarchs on that particular\ndeparture. The natural default in the court setting would be that the defendant did not\ndo it, was not obliged not to do it, and is not liable. An admissible aggregation rule would\nbe to pick two speci\u0085c judges and only to depart from the default on each issue if both\nagreed to do so on that issue. The only anonymous such oligarchy is a unanimity rule\nwith default, where M = N (which is distinct from the unanimity rules we encountered in\nour discussion of relaxing completeness). A feature of oligarchies with default is that each\noligarch has the power to veto any move away from the default. Thus, although we get a\npossibility result with independence here, the possibility is limited.\nMany settings, however, are not truth-functional: Some combination of judgments on\nthe criteria still leave room for the decision to go either way. The hiring committee above\nmight be constrained to accept the candidate if they judge her to meet both criteria, and\nbe constrained to reject her if they judge her to fail on both criteria, but they might\nbe able to accept or reject her if they judge her to meet just one criterion. Many such\nproblems have a natural \u0091monotonicity in criteria\u0092: With an appropriate relabeling of\ncriterion-propositions and their negations, accepting more criteria cannot push you out of\nan acceptance region or into a rejection region, and accepting fewer criteria cannot push\nyou into acceptance or out of rejection. In their second symposium paper, Nehring and\nPuppe [50] show that, in such cases, there are aggregation rules satisfying the Arrovian\nconditions plus monotonicity that avoid veto power \u0096and thereby avoid oligarchy with\ndefault \u0096 if and only if either the acceptance region or the rejection region is empty.17\nThe hiring-committee example above violates this stipulation but if the committee\u0092s only\nconstraint were to reject the candidate if she failed on ability and \u0085eld \u0096i.e., the committee\nwere never forced to accept the candidate \u0096then veto power could be avoided.\nSome of the possible aggregation rules in this case seem natural given the structure of\nthe constraints. In particular, there are admissible aggregation rules that require super-\nmajorities (but not unanimity) on any criterion that might push the collective judgment\ninto the non-empty acceptance or rejection region. In the example, supermajorities would\nbe required to conclude that the candidate has insu\u00a2 cient ability and to conclude that\nthe candidate does not meet the needs of the department. The \u0085nal decision to hire or\n16The quali\u0085cation \u0091essentially\u0092is needed because there could be \u0091redundant\u0092criteria that do not a\u00a4ect\nthe decision either way. Formally, the condition is sometimes called \u0091conjunctive\u0092: Either acceptance\nor rejection of the decision-proposition is logically equivalent to a particular (consistent) conjunction of\nacceptances or rejections on each of the non-redundant criterion-propositions.\n17This result requires the number of voters to be large relative to the number of criteria.\n22\nnot could then be made by simple majority rule. The general intuition here is that if a\nparticular proposition is critical in that accepting it might severely constrain collective\nacceptance of other propositions, then we need to hold it to a higher acceptance standard;\nin this case, a supermajority requirement.\nThis theme returns in Dietrich\u0092s symposium paper [8]. Dietrich discusses, among other\nthings, what he calls simple implication agendas, which contain only atomic propositions\n(and their negations) and propositions (and their negations) asserting an implication such\nas p ! q involving just two atomic propositions. In the expert-panel example of Section\n1, the implication p! q was that if CO2 emissions are above a given threshold, then there\nwill be a temperature increase. Some care is required in interpreting the \u0091!\u0092here. Under\nthe standard material interpretation of propositional logic, p ! q is equivalent to \u0091:p or\nq\u0092. This would rule out (i.e., render inconsistent) the natural sounding judgments favored\nby big oil companies \u0096\u0091CO2 emissions have not exceeded a given threshold, and, even if\nthey had, there still would not be a temperature increase\u0092\u0096since this combines :p and\n: (p! q). Dietrich argues that when the implication p ! q is itself open to judgment\nindependent of the evaluation of the atomic propositions, it is more natural to adopt a\n\u0091subjunctive\u0092interpretation of the implication. Under such an interpretation, p! q rules\nout combining p and :q but is consistent with any other pair of judgments on p and q.\nWith this interpretation of implication, Dietrich provides a startling possibility result\nfor simple implication agendas using just quota rules: Each proposition p 2 X is collec-\ntively accepted if and only if the number of individuals accepting p is greater than or\nequal to a proposition-speci\u0085c quota mp (where, to ensure completeness and to avoid triv-\nial inconsistencies, mp +m:p = n+ 1).18 Dietrich shows that, for any simple implication\nagenda, a quota rule ensures consistency if and only if mq \u0014 mp +mp!q \u0000 n for all p! q\nin the agenda. For intuition, suppose that both p and p ! q are collectively accepted.\nThen the number of individuals who accept both p and p! q is at least equal to the right\nside of the inequality. Each of these individuals must also accept q, and the inequality\nsays that there are enough of them to ensure the collective acceptance of q, which avoids\ninconsistency.\nAn immediate consequence of this result is that if the agenda contains p ! q, then\nmq \u0014 mp. In our expert-panel example, the quota to accept the putative \u0091cause\u0092(CO2\nemissions are above the threshold) must be at least as high as that to accept its putative\n\u0091e\u00a4ect\u0092(temperatures will rise). More generally, if an atomic proposition occurs early in a\nchain of reasoning \u0096for example, if it refers to a more fundamental cause \u0096it must have a\nweakly higher quota. The only way to maintain neutrality across atomic propositions is to\nset the quota mp!q on each implication-proposition equal to n; i.e., to require unanimity.\nIn particular, if there are \u0091cycles\u0092of implications in the agenda, then every p! q in such\na cycle must be held to a unanimity requirement.\nTaken together, these papers suggest that speci\u0085c agendas admit speci\u0085c aggregation\nrules tailored to the setting at hand. A more general lesson, however, is that critical\npropositions need to be held to higher acceptance standards. Understanding this general\nlesson takes us full-circle back to the notion of contagion introduced in Section 3. Recall\nthat, if we can reach q from p by a sequence of conditional entailments, then any winning\ncoalition for p is also winning for q. In the case of quota rules, this means that the quota\nfor q is lower than that for p: perhaps, a simple majority versus a supermajority. More\n18For a discussion of quota rules on general agendas, see Dietrich and List [10].\n23\ngenerally, if there is possible contagion from p to q, then consistent aggregation rules that\nmaintain independence must make it weakly harder to accept p than to accept q.\n5 The abstract algebraic model\nSome papers in the symposium use the logic-based framework outlined in Section 2 above.\nOthers, however, use the abstract algebraic framework introduced by Wilson [61] and\nextended by Rubinstein and Fishburn [56], in which judgments take the form of 0 (\u0091false\u0092)\nor 1 (\u0091true\u0092) evaluations on a \u0085nite non-empty set K = f1; 2; :::; kg of binary issues. An\nevaluation vector is an assignment of 0s and 1s to these issues, formally an element of\nf0; 1gk.\nJust as some sets of propositions in the logic-based model are deemed inconsistent,\nso some evaluation vectors are deemed infeasible. Formally, let Z \u0012 f0; 1gk be the set\nof evaluation vectors that are deemed feasible. For instance, in the expert-panel example\nof Section 1, there are three issues, corresponding to the three proposition-negation pairs\nfp;:pg, fp! q;:(p! q)g, and fq;:qg. The set of feasible evaluation vectors is either\nZ = f(1; 1; 1); (1; 0; 0); (0; 1; 0); (0; 1; 1)g\nor\nZ = f(1; 1; 1); (1; 0; 0); (0; 1; 0); (0; 1; 1); (0; 0; 0); (1; 0; 1); (0; 0; 0)g,\ndepending on whether the conditional ! is interpreted as a \u0091material\u0092conditional (as in\nstandard propositional logic) or as a \u0091subjunctive\u0092 conditional (as in conditional logics,\nlike those discussed in Dietrich\u0092s symposium paper [8]).\nAs the name suggests, the abstract model abstracts from some details of the real-\nworld settings. In particular, the same feasible set can arise from very di\u00a4erent contexts.\nFor example, on the one hand, consider the preference aggregation problem with three\nalternatives x, y and z, and three issues: fx \u001f y; y \u001f xg, fy \u001f z; z \u001f yg, and fx \u001f z; z \u001f\nxg. On the other hand, consider a faculty committee charged to hire some candidates.\nSuppose there is an (as yet) unspeci\u0085ed number of slots and only three candidates: two\nwomen, A and B, and one man, C. Suppose further that, for some reason, the university\nadministrators decide to put just three propositions (and their negations) on the agenda\nfor the faculty committee to decide: \u0091hire at least A\u0092, \u0091hire at least B\u0092, and \u0091hire at least\ntwo of the candidates including at least one woman\u0092. (Notice that this agenda, perhaps\nby design, does not allow the direct expression of support for C only.) Both of these very\ndi\u00a4erent aggregation problems yield the same set of feasible evaluations:\nZ = f(1; 1; 1); (0; 0; 0); (0; 1; 0); (1; 0; 1); (1; 0; 0); (0; 1; 1)g.\nIn the \u0085rst problem, (1; 1; 0) and (0; 0; 1) represent cyclic preferences and hence are ruled\nout. In the second, they represent internally inconsistent choices and hence are ruled out.\nThe details of the setting, including the nature of the inconsistencies, are abstracted away.\nThe advantage of one framework over the other depends on the setting (e.g., the nature\nof the constraints) and the question at hand (e.g., the degree to which the interpretation\nof the propositions and their interconnections matter).\n24\n6 Concluding remarks\nArguably, the initial phase of the recent research e\u00a4ort on judgment aggregation, namely\nthe quest to extend some classic results on preference aggregation to general judgment-\naggregation problems, is now largely complete. In addition to the results discussed above,\nparticularly Arrow\u0092s theorem and various responses to it, some other classic results have\nbeen generalized, notably the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem (Nehring and Puppe [49, 47]\nand relatedly Dietrich and List [11]), and Sen\u0092s liberal paradox (Dietrich and List [14] and\nrelatedly Nehring [45, 46]).19\nThere are at least two challenges for the next phase of work in this area. The move to\ngeneral judgment-aggregation settings has introduced additional complexities not present\nin preference aggregation. One important challenge will be to explore those additional\ncompexities further, especially in the case of aggregation rules that give up propositionwise\nindependence. As noted, Dietrich and Mongin\u0092s symposium contribution on premise-based\napproaches [20] and Dietrich\u0092s recent work on general relevance relations [7] are steps in\nthis direction, but more work remains to be done on characterizations of compelling non-\nindependent aggregation rules.\nAnother challenge will be to extend the theory of judgment aggregation from the case of\nbinary judgments to that of general propositional attitudes, which need not be binary and\nwhich may be governed by very di\u00a4erent rationality or feasibility constraints. Recent con-\ntributions along these lines include some works on judgment aggregation in many-valued\nlogics (Pauly and van Hees [52], van Hees [60]), some works on the relationship between\njudgment aggregation and probability aggregation (Osherson and Vardi [51], Dietrich and\nList [12], Nehring [46]), and some works on the aggregation of abstract, non-binary evalua-\ntions (Rubinstein and Fishburn [56], Dokow and Holzman [22]) or of general propositional\nattitudes (Dietrich and List [17], Duddy and Piggins [25]). The non-binary case, like the\nnon-independent one, permits far more possibilities than the more constrained binary and\nindependent case, and the di\u00a2 culty will be to arrive at elegant characterizations of aggre-\ngation rules given the additional degrees of freedom. We hope that the present symposium\nwill provide a useful entrance point to this vibrant area of research and stimulate further\nwork.\nReferences\n[1] Arrow, K.
