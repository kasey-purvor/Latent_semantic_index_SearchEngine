INTRODUCTION\nMAGNETIC INDUCTION TOMOGRAPHY (MIT) is anew modality for medical, industrial, and geophysical\nimaging [1]\u2013[3]. The problem of MIT image reconstruction is\nsimilar to the inverse eddy-current problem of nondestructive\ntesting (NDT) [4]\u2013[7]. The measurement data are the mutual\ninductances between pairs of coils. The contact-less nature of\nthis type of tomography makes the technique of interest for non-\ninvasive and nonintrusive applications. The technique operates\nas follows. Passing an alternating current through the excitation\ncoil(s) produces a primary magnetic field. When this magnetic\nfield interacts with either a conductive and\/or a magnetic object,\na secondary magnetic field is created. The sensing coils can then\ndetect this secondary field. As the secondary field depends on the\nmaterials present, the measured induced voltage is a nonlinear\nfunction of their electrical properties, e.g., conductivity and\npermeability. In comparison with conventional eddy-current\nmethods, MIT is significant in that it measures the magnetic\ncoupling, rather than self-inductance, using sensors that are\ndistributed around the periphery, and therefore is able to image\nthe distribution of materials inside a region of interest. Image\nreconstruction is an inverse problem where the measured volt-\nages are given and the spatial distribution of electromagnetic\nproperties of the object material need to be found. Linear recon-\nstruction methods [8], [9] are fast and can be successfully applied\nto isolated objects. In general, it is necessary to use nonlinear\nreconstruction methods. The most commonly used method for\nthe image reconstruction in electrical impedance tomography\n(EIT) is a regularized Gauss\u2013Newton method. This method has\nbeen studied for magnetostatic permeability tomography using\nsimulated data in [10]. Each step of such an iterative method is a\nlinear problem. This paper presents such a method to the inverse\nproblem of MIT using experimental test data. To be practically\nusable, it is very important for an image reconstruction method\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/TMAG.2006.871255\nto be tested with experimental data. In this paper, we present the\nreconstruction results for laboratory tests as well as experimental\nresults from a practical test in molten steel flow visualization [8].\nReconstruction of the MIT images requires a forward solver so\nthat predicted data can be compared with measured data. The\nforward problem in MIT is the eddy-current approximation of\nMaxwell\u2019s equations, which involves computation of the vector\nfields. The edge finite-element method (FEM) has advantages\nover nodal FEM for vector field computation in eddy-current\nproblems [11], and it is a powerful tool for simulation of the for-\nward problem in MIT [12], [13]. We have implemented a flexible\nedge-based finite-element eddy-current solver for the forward\nproblem in MIT using a magnetic vector potential formulation\n[13]. An efficient formulation for the Jacobian matrix is used\n[14]\u2013[16]. The method requires only two solutions of the forward\nproblem for each coil pair, first exciting one coil and then the\nsecond.\nIn order to stabilize the ill-posed inverse problem, regular-\nization techniques are required. A common choice is Tikhonov\nregularization that assumes a smooth conductivity distribution\n[10]. The Tikhonov regularized Gauss\u2013Newton method is not\nideally suited to problems with a sharp transition in conduc-\ntivity between phases. The total variation (TV) functional as-\nsumes an important role in the regularization of inverse problem\narising in many disciplines [17], after its initial introduction in\nimage restoration. The use of such a functional as a regular-\nization penalty term allows the reconstruction of discontinuous\nprofiles. This is a desirable property where there are sharp edges\nwith large transitions of the conductivity profile. TV has been\napplied to the general form of the elliptic inverse problem [18],\nand EIT [19]. In this paper, we further examine the advantage\nof TV regularization in separation of high contrast conductivity\nobjects close to each other with experimental test examples.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce\na newly developed MIT system used for the experimental tests.\nIn Section III, we describe our edge FEM formulation of the\nforward problem. A sensitivity analysis using an efficient for-\nmulation will be given in Section IV, where we also present an\n0018-9464\/$20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE\nSOLEIMANI et al.: 3-D INVERSE FEM APPLIED TO EXPERIMENTAL EDDY-CURRENT IMAGING DATA 1561\nFig. 1.

In Section V,\nwe explain the nonlinear inverse solver and with commonly\nused Tikhonov and with TV regularization. In Section VI, the\nexperimental results will be presented using these new methods.\nThe experimental reconstruction presented in Section VI-A\nare among the first experimental MIT reconstructions using an\nFE-based inversion technique. In Section VI-B, we also present\nthe molten steel flow images from an MIT experimental system.\nII. MIT SYSTEM DESCRIPTION\nThe MIT technique has been considered in situations where\nthe target materials of interest are characterized by electrical\nconductivity, as is the case of monitoring of the steel flow in\na continuous casting nozzle [8].\nFig. 1 shows a diagram of the main parts of the MIT system.\nThe hardware consists of a sensor array, waveform generation;\nhigh current buffer for excitation; programmable gain amplifi-\ncation and in-phase\/quadrature demodulation for detection and\nanalog to digital conversion. The waveform generator outputs a\n5 kHz sinusoidal current. The electronic hardware also allows\nthe switching of the alternating current signal to each coil for\nexcitation sequentially, controls the gain selection for the in-\nduced voltage amplification, and selects the demodulated signal\ncomponents for analog-to-digital conversion. Full details of the\nelectronic hardware are beyond the scope of this paper, but have\nbeen reported elsewhere [20].\nThe sensor array contains eight wire wound coils (50 turns,\n50 mm diameter). The distance between centers of two oppo-\nsite coils is 160 mm. All the coils are equally spaced at intervals\naround the periphery of the object to be imaged. The region of\ninterest for the imaging is a cylinder with radius 0.07 m, length\n0.10 m centered at (0,0,0), and a relative permeability of 1 (la-\nbeled C1). Each coil is excited in turn and the induced voltages\nare measured in the remaining coils. The real part of the induced\nvoltage (in-phase with the excitation) has been used for the con-\nductivity reconstruction.\nIII. FORWARD PROBLEM\nThe forward problem is a general eddy-current problem and is\nsolvedusinganedgeFEMmethodin termsofmagneticvectorpo-\ntential [11], [13]. The forward model has been validated in a\npreviousstudy[13].Given and ,wehave\n(1)\nin nonconductive regions, where . In the conductive\nregion we have\n(2)\nHere is electrical conductivity and is angular frequency. Let\nus denote by the nodal scalar basis function. In edge FEM on\na tetrahedral mesh, a vector field is represented using a basis of\nvector valued functions associated with the edge between\nnodes and\n(3)\nUsing edge finite elements\n(4)\nwhere is any linear combination of edge basis functions,\nis the entire region, is the eddy-current region, and\nis the current source region. Here electric vector potential\nhas been used to simulate the current source\nas described [11]. The incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient\n(ICCG) method has been used to solve the linear system of equa-\ntions arising from the forward problem [11]. In each iteration\nof the inverse problem, we solve the forward problem and the\nstarting point for ICCG iteration is the latest value of magnetic\nvector potential in previous step.\nIV. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS\nThe sensitivity formula has been derived earlier from the gen-\neral form of Maxwell\u2019s equations and for the special case of in-\nverse eddy-current problem of MIT [14], [16]. A sensitivity for-\nmula that reflects the high conductivity changes has been used\nfor eddy-current NDT (see for example [4]).\nThe general form of the sensitivity formula when the coil 1\nis an excitation coil and coil 2 is a sensing coil, by ignoring\nsecond-order terms is [14]\n(5)\nwhere the left-hand side is representing sensing and excitation\nby surface integral on surface and the right-hand side is the\nvolume integral over the perturbed region . and are the\nmagnetic and electric fields when coil 1 is excited and and\nare the magnetic and electric fields when coil 2 is excited.\nSimilar sensitivity formulas have been discovered in the litera-\nture of numerous electromagnetic sensing methods and justified\nwith varying degrees of mathematical rigor. In the NDT context,\n[21] is an early example. With the formulation and using\nedge FEM, the sensitivity to a change in the conductivity of the\nconducting region can be calculated using the results of the for-\nward solver, given no change in permeability and permittivity\nvalues in (5). Using the edge element basis functions , the\npotential inside each element can be expressed as follows:\n(6)\n1562 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS, VOL. 42, NO. 5, MAY 2006\nFig. 2. Sensitivity plot for two opposite coils in 3-D for unit current density in\nexcitation coil, the sensitivity values for the real part of the induced voltage are\nin VmS , dimensions are in m.\nwhere are defined along edges. With that, the sensitivity term\nfor each element as follows:\n(7)\nEquation (7) gives us sensitivity of the induced voltage pairs\nof coils of with respect to an element and is the volume\nof element number and and are excitation currents for\nthe coils. For small conductivity perturbations, the formula pre-\nsented in [4] reduces to (7). A similar formula has also been\npresented by [6] for the NDT problem.\nIn the edge FEM software we developed for image recon-\nstruction, we calculate in all elements by (6). We can then\nuse (7) simply for region , which includes more than one fi-\nnite element. Then the computation of the Jacobian matrix is a\nmatrix vector multiplication for each measurement. The sensi-\ntivity map changes with the background conductivity [22]. With\na conductive background close to the surface, we have higher\neddy currents, and consequentially those areas have higher sen-\nsitivity. Sensitivity also depends on the geometrical configu-\nration of the sensing and exciting coils. For example, using a\nsingle frequency and fixed shape of the conductive background,\nfor high conductivity the higher eddy-current density region is\nvery small and changes in regions very close to the boundary\nare more easily detectable. When the conductivity decreases,\nthe area of high sensitivity spreads toward the center. Finally,\nwhen the conductivity goes to zero, the more sensitive area is\nno longer affected by the conductive background shape and it\nis only affected by the geometrical configuration of the sensing\nand exciting coils. Fig. 2 shows a 3-D sensitivity map for two op-\nposite coils centered at and , the background\nis C1 with conductivity 4 Sm and frequency is 1 MHz. As it\ncan be seen in this figure, the sensitivity reduces toward the cen-\ntral area as the eddy current is higher near the boundary of the\nconductive object.\nFig. 3. Singular values of the Jacobian matrix (J) for the real and imaginary\npart of the measurement voltages on a logarithmic scale (background is C1 with\nconductivity 4 Sm and frequency 1 MHz).\nA. Jacobian Matrix\nIn the Jacobian matrix, each row is the calculated sensitivity\nterm for an element for all measurements. Fig. 3 shows the dis-\ntribution of the singular values of the real part of the Jacobian\nmatrix. In a noise- and error-free situation, it is possible to re-\nconstruct an image with up to 28 parameters. In real data and\nwith measurement errors, according to the discrete Picard cri-\nterion, some of the small singular values may not reliably con-\ntribute to the image reconstruction. It is worth noticing that some\nof these small singular values may represent important and de-\nsirable parts of the images which may not be reconstructed due\nto noise and error in the measurement.\nTo illustrate the degree of ill conditioning in the problem,\nthe singular values are plotted on the log scale (Fig. 3). The\nroughly linear decay of the first 28 singular values shows that\nthe problem is ill-posed. Here the background conductivity is\nthe cylinder C1 with homogeneous conductivity of 4 Sm and\nfrequency is 1 MHz. In medical MIT, the in-phase component\nof the received signal are used to reconstruct conductivity of\nthe tissue [23]. The quality of imaging depends on the precision\nwith which the real part can be measured. In Fig. 3, one can see\nthat using the imaginary part of receiving signal (with this par-\nticular conductivity and frequency) the inverse problem is actu-\nally better posed than using the real part. In practical terms, mea-\nsuring the imaginary part (detecting a very small signal due to\nthe conductive object, in-phase with a very large primary signal)\nis a very difficult task for medical MIT applications.\nFig. 4 shows the singular values of the Jacobian for back-\nground C1 with conductivity 5.8 10 Sm and frequency\n5 kHz. This figure shows that using real part or imaginary part\nto reconstruct conductivity is more ill-posed that the problem of\nFig. 3, but the ill-posedness of the problem using real data and\nimaginary data is similar.\nV. INVERSE PROBLEM\nA regularized Gauss\u2013Newton method is used to solve the in-\nverse problem. We denote by the measurement data, and\nby the forward operator, which takes the vector of degree of\nSOLEIMANI et al.: 3-D INVERSE FEM APPLIED TO EXPERIMENTAL EDDY-CURRENT IMAGING DATA 1563\nFig. 4.

The inverse solver is an optimization algorithm that\nfinds a to minimize a suitable error functional. Reformulation\nof the inverse problem to include prior information is known as\nregularization and it can be expressed as a minimization of the\nfunctional\n(8)\nwhere is a penalty term. The Jacobian matrix is a dis-\ncretization of . The regularization parameter controls\nthe tradeoff between fitting the data and reducing the penalty\nterm. For a well-chosen will have a critical point which is\nthe minimum, at this minimum . A typical example of a\ndiscrete form of a penalty term is for a matrix\napproximating a differential operator. A more detailed study\nof the iterative Gauss\u2013Newton step to solve nonlinear ill-posed\nproblem can be seen in [24]. As an iterative reconstruction al-\ngorithm, we start our regularized Gauss\u2013Newton method with\nan initial conductivity distribution . The forward problem is\nsolved and the predicted voltages are compared with the calcu-\nlated voltages from the forward model. The conductivity is then\nupdated. The process is repeated until the predicted voltages\nfrom the finite-element method agree with the calculated volt-\nages from the finite-element model to measurement precision.\nIn the nonlinear steps, the Jacobian matrix is also updated in\neach step. Solving this minimization problem by Gauss\u2013Newton\nleads to linear steps, each of which is the regularized step of the\nlinearized problem (for the simple form of above)\n(9)\nwhere is the iteration step. For , this is a linear recon-\nstruction algorithm.\nA. Tikhonov Regularization\nA natural assumption is that the conductivity is fairly smooth,\nwhich can be expressed by demanding that\nFig. 5. Singular value distribution for J J + \u000b R R for cylinder C1 for\ndifferent regularization parameters (different values for \u000b ).\nis not too large, where the regularization matrix is a dif-\nference operator between neighboring pixels. This results in\n(generalized) Tikhonov regularization, which penalizes extreme\nvariations in conductivity removing the instability in the recon-\nstruction at the cost of producing artificially smooth images. A\ncommon choice for is a discrete approximation to the Laplace\noperator, in which case the penalty term is a discrete approxi-\nmation to\n(10)\nwhere is the region of interest for the image.\nThe effect of Tikhonov regularization can be seen in Fig. 5,\nwhere the singular values cluster when the Tikhonov regulariza-\ntion matrix is applied to enforce a smoothness assumption to the\nconductivity distribution.\nB. Total Variation Regularization\nAlthough Tikhonov type regularization provides a good\nmethod to reconstruct smooth parameters both in terms of\ncontrast and shape, it fails to reconstruct the sharp edges and\nabsolute values for the high contrast case. TV regularization is\na more suitable method for both sharp edges and high contrast.\nUsing TV regularization to reconstruct the sharp edges has been\ndiscussed in [19] for EIT. The recovery of sharp edges in MIT\nusing TV regularization is similar to the EIT problem. In other\nwords, the TV functional is used to encourage blocky images\nas a regularized solution.

Experimental Tests\nPreliminary results using simulation data have been presented\nearlier. In [26], the simulation results for high contrast conduc-\ntivity and in [27], the simulation results for low contrast conduc-\ntivity (medical MIT) have been presented. In this paper, we are\nmore concerned with validating the method with experimental\ndata. Electrically conductive objects were tested using data from\nthe MIT system. Test objects\u2014rods and bars\u2014used were 30 cm\nlong, which we considered long compared to the 5 cm diameter\nof the detector element. These tests were arranged to represent\ntypical liquid metal flow profiles such as central and multiple\nstreams. Fig. 6 shows one object representing a single stream,\nwhere the image is well defined when a 9 mm diameter copper\nrod is placed at the center. Figs. 7 and 8 show the image re-\nsults with multiple objects being tested representing multiple\nFig. 8. Cross sections of reconstruction of four metal objects. Heights as Fig. 6.\nFig. 9. Cross sections of reconstruction of a rectangular object in center.\nHeights as Fig. 6.\nflow streams. In Fig. 7, three copper rods with 19 mm diameter\nwere placed upright at the corners of an equilateral triangle. As\nshown in Fig. 8, three big copper rods (19 mm in diameter) and\none small copper (12.5 mm in diameter) are clearly visible. An\nobject with rectangular cross section was also tested, namely\na rectangular box with a cross-sectional size of approximately\n80 mm 50 mm. Fig. 9 shows the reconstructed rectangular ob-\nject using TV regularization. This showed better preservation of\nthe sharp edges of the rectangular object than Tikhonov regular-\nization. For smooth shape single objects or for objects far from\neach other, the TV and Tikhonov regularization produced sim-\nilar images. Fig. 10 shows reconstruction of three copper bars\nclose to each other (30 mm apart), using TV and Tikhonov reg-\nularization. In TV regularization, the separation between bars is\nimproved compared to Tikhonov regularization. The number of\niterations used for the inverse problem in these examples is less\nthan six; further iterations were found not to improve the image\nquality. We have as yet found no fool-proof way to choose the\nregularization parameter for the nonlinear inverse problem. In\nthis study we choose the regularization parameter using ad hoc\nmethods, and this must always be treated with caution. The best\none can hope for is to find a good parameter choice for a par-\nticular experimental setup and range of target objects. Further\nSOLEIMANI et al.: 3-D INVERSE FEM APPLIED TO EXPERIMENTAL EDDY-CURRENT IMAGING DATA 1565\nFig. 10. Cross sections of reconstruction of three metallic objects close to each\nother using TV regularization and Tikhonov regularization. Heights as Fig. 6.\n(a) Tikhonov regularization. (b) Total variation regularization.\nstudies are required to find an automatic choice of regulariza-\ntion parameter in this nonlinear inverse problem. The regular-\nization parameter was chosen 10 for Tikhonov regularization\nand 10 for TV regularization in all iterations.\nIn the MIT problem, the effect of high conductivity regions\non measurements saturates as the conductivity increases. This is\nevident even in the modest conductivity contrasts in medical ap-\nplications as discussed in [10]. For this reason reconstruction of\nthe absolute values of the high contrast conductivities (quantita-\ntive image reconstruction) is a difficult, or perhaps an impossible,\ntask both numerically and experimentally. Nonlinear reconstruc-\ntion algorithms will typically result in a conductivity that fits the\nmeasurements to within the measurement or forward modeling\nerror, but the conductivity contrast will be underestimated for\nlarge contrast objects. In our present work, we show the advan-\ntage of nonlinear image reconstruction in improving the quanti-\ntative estimation in that for high contrast objects the contrast in\nthe reconstructed image is greater than for a linear step. How-\never, a more important advantage we claim is an improvement\nin object localization. Taking the example of Fig. 8, the plot of\nFig. 11 shows the reduction in the cost functional (8) for each it-\neration. Fig. 12 shows a cross section of the image at each itera-\ntion. In each iteration the separation between objects improved,\nFig. 11. Reduction in cost function with iteration steps.\nand the contrast between the background and reconstructed con-\nductivity of the rods increases up to six iterations at which satura-\ntion sets in and no further improvement is observed. Our explana-\ntion for this improvement in separation at each iteration is that in\na nonlinear reconstruction algorithm, by recalculating the Jaco-\nbian matrix and forward model we account better for the interfer-\nence of the secondary field between highly conductive objects.\nThis is in contrast to the case of a single linear step that only con-\nsiders the sensitivity at a fixed (homogeneous) background. We\nexpect that the interference between highly conductive objects\nwill increase with increasing the excitation frequency, and also\nthe saturation will occur in lower conductivity values at higher\nfrequency. The saturation and interference between near by ob-\njects is also a function of how close they are to the excitation\ncoil\u2014nearer to excitation coils, higher field strengths might be\nexpected to produce a greater interference effect.\nThe edge FEM forward solver and the image reconstruction\nsoftware have been written in Matlab. The overall number of\ntetrahedral elements in forward model was 86 757 and the re-\ngion of interest (Cylinder C1), which was used in inverse so-\nlution, included 3058 tetrahedral elements. The computer had\na 1.7 GHz Intel Pentium M processor and 512 MB of RAM.\nThe computational time for each nonlinear iteration of the in-\nverse problem (consisting mainly of the forward solver, Jaco-\nbian calculation and inversion) was 26 min. The major parts of\nthe computational time includes solving two linear system of\nequations: one is for the forward problem involving a large but\nsparse matrix and the other one involves solution of a smaller\nbut full matrix arising from the inverse problem.\nB. Flow Visualization in Continuous Casting\nContinuous casting is a process by which molten steel is\nformed into semi-finished billets, blooms, and slabs. Liquid\nsteel from the basic oxygen steel-making or electric arc furnace\nprocess and subsequent secondary steel-making, is transferred\nfrom a ladle, via a refractory shroud, into the tundish. The tundish\nacts as a reservoir, both for liquid steel delivery and removal of\noxide inclusions. A stopper rod or sliding gate is used to control\nthe steel flow rate into the mould through a submerged entry\nnozzle (SEN). The SEN distributes the steel within the mould,\nshrouds the liquid steel from the surrounding environment,\n1566 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS, VOL. 42, NO. 5, MAY 2006\nFig. 12. Reconstruction of four metallic objects in iterations 1, 3, and 6. Note\nthat they are displayed on different scales to show the improvement in object\nlocalization.

(c) Step 6.\nand reduces air entrainment, thus preventing reoxidation and\nmaintaining steel cleanliness. A photograph of real molten steel\nflow in continuous casting can be seen in Fig. 13.\nFig. 13. Example of steel flow through a glass tube during a hot experiment.\nFig. 14. Reconstruction of real steel flow, time is in seconds and X and Y here\nare in mm, for each time step the image shows the Z = 0 level of 3-D image.\nThe hot casting trials were undertaken at Corus RD&T,\nTeesside Technology Centre. The sensor array was placed\naround a transparent quartz glass tube within a standard slab\ncaster SEN and connected to the MIT instrument through long\nthermally shielded cables. Molten steel was supplied from a\n4-ton nominal capacity electric arc furnace via a stoppered\nladle to a tundish and then passed to a mock casting mould via\nthe glass tube to enable the steel submerged pouring to be sim-\nulated. The outputs are arranged in a data matrix such that the\nrows represent the time sequence, i.e., image frame index, and\nthe columns the coil-pair measurements. A selection of results\nis shown in Fig. 14. The images are shown in sequence from\ntop to bottom indicating the pouring of molten steel at different\ntime instants. The results were consistent with the real pouring\narrangement in that pouring was initially positioned in the\ncenter and then positioned off-center. Consequentially, the hot\ntrial results demonstrate the success of using electromagnetic\nsensing technique to monitor and visualize the real molten steel\nflow through a pouring nozzle.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we described a general reconstruction method\nfor 3-D magnetic induction tomography. Application of total\nvariation regularization improves the separation between ob-\njects close to each other and recovery of sharp edges. The en-\ncouraging results from pilot plant trials suggest that the pro-\nSOLEIMANI et al.: 3-D INVERSE FEM APPLIED TO EXPERIMENTAL EDDY-CURRENT IMAGING DATA 1567\nposed MIT reconstruction method may be useful for monitoring\nand visualization of real molten steel flow through a pouring\nnozzle, although the stability of the hardware is an issue if the\nsystem is used for longer times in a hot environment. The pro-\nposed technique in this paper can be used in off-line image re-\nconstruction in MIT, as the computational time can be very high.\nFurther studies are required to improve the speed of the pro-\nposed technique for online monitoring. In particular improving\nthe speed of the forward solver (for example by using algebraic\nmultigrid solvers), use of parallel processing, and improvement\nin speed of the linear solvers for the inverse problem in each\niteration step. Quantitative image reconstruction for high con-\ntrast conductivity applications, while desirable for some appli-\ncations, is hard to achieve even with total variation regular-\nization but reasonable qualitative results are possible. Further\nwork is needed to both improve the accuracy of the experi-\nmental system and modeling in order to improve reconstruction\naccuracy.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was supported by the UK Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council (EPRSC) under Grant\nGR\/R64278\/01 and Grant GR\/R64285\/01, and by Corus Group\nRD&T, Teesside Technology Centre.\nREFERENCES\n[1] H.
