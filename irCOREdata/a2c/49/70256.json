We focus\non our experiences gained from building and deploying three experimental\npublic display systems as part of the e-Campus project. This project is ex-\nploring the creation of large scale networked displays that can form part of\nan interactive pervasive computing environment embedded in public phys-\nical spaces. The deployments vary in technology, location, scale and user\ncommunity and have provided us with a rich set of experiences. Based on\nthese experiences we present a series of lessons that are certainly applicable\nto researchers planning similar deployments of public displays and may also,\nwe believe, generalize to many other public ubicomp deployments. Where\nappropriate we provide evidence of this by drawing on our experiences from\nother deployment-oriented projects such as GUIDE [1].\n1\n2 Deployments\n2.1 Deployment 1: WMCSA 2004 Conference Signage\nOur first deployment was a digital signage solution at the 6th IEEE Work-\nshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications, WMCSA 2004. The\nWMCSA system consisted of four public displays stationed outside each\nof the entrances to the main auditorium and demo room. The displays\nprovided a rolling display of information for delegates tailored to the dis-\nplay\u2019s location (proximity to ongoing conference activities) and the time of\nday. Each display was able to show information relevant to the talks being\npresented in the adjacent rooms, about activities in the wider locale, and\nnavigation symbols directing delegates to refreshments at appropriate times\nof the day. The displays were interconnected via a local network, allowing\nus to synchronise content across the displays on a per content item basis.\nOne of the key issues we sought to explore with WMCSA was how to\nsimplify the process of injecting content into the system and of mapping that\ncontent to displays. We did this by exploiting a separation of concerns: au-\nthors could create content items (images, web pages, RSS feeds and videos)\nand request these to be mapped dynamically to the network of displays\nusing a constraint based scheduler. The content of the WMCSA system\nwas therefore reduced to a set of scheduling requests. A scheduler associ-\nated with each display observed these requests and attempted to construct\na timeline for the display that best matched the requested set of constraints.\nWhere content was required to be synchronised across displays, a distributed\nagreement protocol was used to converge on a mutually agreeable time in\neach scheduler\u2019s timeline.\n2.2 Deployment 2: Brewery Arts Centre Exhibition to Com-\nmemorate the 60th Anniversary of VE Day\nThe second installation took place at a local arts centre (The Brewery Arts\nCentre in Kendal, Cumbria) as part of their celebrations of the 60th An-\nniversary of VE Day. Specifically, the installation was one element of an\ninteractive exhibition of local wartime memorabilia designed to raise aware-\nness of life in the region during World War II. The installation consisted of\nfour main components: a set of three large projected public displays (see\nfigure 2), a video diary booth, a web based diary, and \u2018the Kirlian Table\u2019\n(an interactive art exhibit created by a local arts collective). The public\ndisplays showed a series of news footage and radio broadcasts evocative of\nthe era, interspersed with images captured from the interactive table sur-\nface and video diary entries. The video diary application enabled visitors\nof the exhibition to record their own war-related memories, that could then\nbe accessed by visitors via a local web based content management system.\n2\nFigure 1: One of the WMCSA situated public displays. The display is\nshowing a carousel of photos from the surrounding Lake District National\nPark, the current weather forecast, and an RSS ticker of the forthcoming\ntalks.\nAdditionally, if consent had been given, diary entries were scheduled and\ndisplayed on the multi-screen projector public display system.\nPrior to deployment individual parts of the Brewery system were devel-\noped and tested in isolation in one of our labs. Installation, integration and\nfinal testing of the components took place in the exhibition space over a\nperiod of 48 hours and were directly followed by the official opening night\nof the exhibition \u2013 a highly visible event.\nThe system remained active for a total of 14 days, i.e. for the entire\nduration of the exhibition. During the fortnight, 1723 visitors attended\nthe exhibition. They were encouraged to leave feedback about the system\nusing provided questionnaires. Additional information was collected through\nobservations. Results suggest that generally visitors found the exhibition\ninformative, innovative, interesting and appealing.\n2.3 Deployment 3: The Underpass\nThe last in our series of deployments was installed in an underground bus\nstation on campus (called \u2018the Underpass\u2019). The aim of the installation was\nto enrich this \u2018interstitial non-space\u2019 by providing a mixture of information\n3\nFigure 2: Photograph of the Brewery gallery space during setup of the exhi-\nbition. The projected displays (showing test images) are in the background.\nThe video diary booth is out of shot far left, the web kiosks are behind\nthe photographer. Various elements of the \u2018evidence\u2019 exhibition are in place\nwith irreplaceable items locked in a glass case, to the foreground.\nand interactive content to people waiting for buses. In contrast to our other\ntechnology probes, the installation in the Underpass was intended to be a\nlong term deployment, i.e. lasting at least for several months, possibly up\nto a few years. To fit the physical dimensions of the space, it was decided\nto deploy three large-scale projected displays that would be aligned side-by-\nside. We also wanted to be able to either use each of the projection surfaces\nindependently or in combination as wide-screen displays of 2 or 3 displays.\n\u00bfFrom the start we aimed to employ a mixture of content, including artis-\ntic material, textual information and videos. Consequently the installation\nopened up with a piece of interactive art (called \u2018Metamorphosis\u2019, see figure\n3) that consisted of a set of 3 videos that were to be shown side-by-side and\nwere controlled by a Max\/MSP1 script. Metamorphosis was essentially self-\ncontained and distributed across four dedicated Mac Mini machines. Three\nof these machines were responsible for rendering the videos. The fourth Mac\nMini was in charge of controlling the playback according to events reported\nby external sensors that were triggered by passing traffic.\nTo support additional content besides Metamorphosis we deployed a PC\nwith a multi-headed graphics card that allowed us to either render different\npieces of content on each head or render content that spanned across two\nor more heads. An AV matrix switch2 and an embedded AMX controller3\nwere put in place to allow us to switch between content rendered on the PC\nand content rendered on the dedicated Mini Macs.\nThe majority of the hardware was installed in a rack in a garage in the\n1http:\/\/www.cycling74.com\/products\/maxmsp\n2http:\/\/www.sierravideo.com\/\n3http:\/\/www.amx.com\n4\nFigure 3: Photograph of the opening of the Metamorphosis installation using\nthe public displays in the Underpass. Inset: members of .:thePooch:. arts\ncollective keeping a close eye on the system console.\nUnderpass. Due to technical as well as health and safety considerations\n\u2013 we had to make sure not to blind the drivers of passing traffic \u2013 the\nprojectors had to be mounted on the tunnel ceiling directly above the road\nwith special lenses fitted to correct for keystoning etc. Deployment of the\nprojection system therefore required a complete closure of the Underpass for\nseveral days to enable the installation and wiring to take place.\n3 Lessons in Deploying Ubicomp in Public Spaces\nTechnology and Deployment\nOver the years our group has amassed considerable experience in deploying\nmobile and ubiquitous computing applications (e.g. in the GUIDE project\n[1]). However, we were still surprised by the sheer volume of work involved in\ncreating the deployments described in this paper. For example, the Brewery\ndeployment required a team of almost a dozen people to create the system\nand to physically install it. After the installation, staff were needed more or\nless permanently on-site during the exhibition. For the Underpass deploy-\nment many months were spent on non-technical activities such as liaising\nwith local transport companies and University bodies. Our first lesson is\n5\nthus: \u201cnever underestimate the effort involved in creating real deployments\nof systems\u201d. Indeed, even on the technical front we were surprised by the\ncomplexity of the AV installation we required. Hardware for the Under-\npass deployment occupies most of a full-height rack and includes specialized\ncomponents such as an AMX controller that has its own full programming\nlanguage and associated development tools that needed to be mastered.\nOur second lesson is \u201cnever underestimate the impact of environmen-\ntal factors on a deployment\u201d. In both the Brewery and the Underpass in-\nstallations we faced significant technical challenges. At the Brewery these\nprincipally related to the absence of adequate high speed network access\nand the non-technical nature of the staff manning the exhibition. However,\nother environmental factors also impacted on our deployment. For example,\nthe Brewery tests its fire alarms weekly during which time they shut off all\npower to the room in which the exhibition was taking place.\nIn the Underpass the physical environment created enormous difficulties\nfor our work \u2013 the Underpass itself is a cold, dark, damp, public space\nand is heavily polluted with diesel fumes. This meant, for example, that the\nprojectors had to be housed in specially designed cases that could withstand\nthe elements and physical damage while simultaneously providing adequate\ncooling for the projectors and filtration of the diesel fumes. To give some\nidea of the scale of the problems our first attempt at an install ran for less\nthan one week before the filters in the projectors were so clogged with diesel\nthat the projectors themselves overheated and shut down. This was despite\nthe fact that the projectors were installed in custom designed housings with\nfilters that were supposed to remove the diesel particles.\nThe need to adapt and maintain our deployment leads us to our third\nand fourth lessons: \u201cdeploy for maintainability and change\u201d and \u201ccreate\nand keep duplicate deployments in the lab\u201d. While the need for maintain-\nability may sound obvious it is worth providing a concrete example of the\ntrade-offs involved. The projectors in our Underpass installation are located\nabove a road and maintaining them requires closing the road. During term\ntime this is practically impossible and thus any failures of these components\nincur on average a 5 week downtime (terms are 10 weeks so long so in the\nworst case we can have the system out of commission for 10 weeks). With\nhindsight we should probably have mounted the projectors on a moving\nplatform that could have been mechanically pulled clear of the road. At the\ntime we deemed the extra expense to be unjustified, but this was probably\nbad judgement on our part. Creating duplicate deployments in the lab is\nobviously good practice but we have found that the temptation is to create\na deployment in the lab and then to move this installation into the field.\nBased on our experiences we would recommend keeping a duplicate in the\nlab to ease testing of proposed maintenance procedures. We believe that in\nmost cases the extra costs involved will be more than justified in terms of\nease of testing and maintenance.\n6\nOur fifth and final lesson is \u201canticipate and plan for regulatory compli-\nance issues\u201d. In our deployments we encountered numerous regulations that,\ninevitably, governed our deployments of the systems. While some of these\nare absolutely standard (e.g. compliance with safety standards for electri-\ncal installations) others we had not anticipated. For example, the need to\nprovide access to the displays (and the information thereon) for disabled\npeople \u2013 creating a technology deployment that does not implicitly discrim-\ninate needs great care. As a second example, compliance with health and\nsafety regulations when carrying out system maintenance has increased the\ntime taken to carry out even apparently simple tasks.\nMonitoring and Management\nDuring the WMCSA deployment members of our team were also delegates at\nthe workshop and were therefore on site all the time. Failures of the display\nsystem were therefore relatively easy to spot and rectify. As the deployment\nat the Brewery Arts Centre was scheduled to run for two weeks, we de-\ncided to try to monitor the system remotely, i.e. essentially by periodically\nchecking the system\u2019s activities on the event channel and by monitoring logs\nobtained from individual components, both of which could be obtained by\nlogging into the systems from a remote location. However, it quickly became\nobvious that even if all the components in our distributed system appeared\nto be perfectly healthy, the system might still not actually be functional as\nfar as human observers were concerned. For example, the information we\nobtained did not include any clues about the health of the three projectors.\nConsequently, we received a number of phone calls during the first few days\nof the deployment about malfunctions of the system that turned out to be\ndown to either the projectors overheating or one of the projector\u2019s bulbs\nhaving reached the end of its lifetime. In the end we had to revert to the\nmonitoring approach we had used for WMCSA, i.e. to put people on site\nthat were able to visually monitor the health of the system by looking at\nthe output on the projected displays. The lesson we draw from this is:\n\u201censure that it is possible to remotely monitor the output of the system as\nit is perceived by the user\u201d. In our more recent deployments we have been\nvery careful to provide adequate monitoring facilities, e.g. in the Underpass\ndeployment by installing a set of cameras capturing the output of the dis-\nplays, enabling members of the project to inspect the visible state of the\nsystem from remote locations.\nThe seventh lesson we learned is complementing the issue raised in the\nprevious paragraph from a systems perspective. The lesson here is that \u201cit\nis important to provide tools and abstractions to enable inviduals to reason\nabout the state of the system\u201d. One issue we encountered early on during the\nBrewery deployment was that it proved difficult to tell what item of content\nwould be displayed next and how long it would take until, for example, a\n7\nvideo diary entry would be displayed. Watching the projectors did not help\nas during each cycle of the schedule individual pieces of content would often\nbe displayed more than once. Inspecting the system\u2019s output on the console\nand the event channel did not help either as the information provided did\nnot contain data about the relative position of the piece of content currently\nbeing displayed with respect to other pieces of content. Complicating mat-\nters even more, the schedule also contained periods during which no content\nwould be displayed to allow the projectors to cool down. Lacking appropri-\nate monitoring tools that provide an abstract overview over the systems\u2019s\nstatus we found it very difficult to determine whether at a specific point in\ntime the displays were scheduled to be blank or whether a fault had occurred\nin the system, causing the displays not to show any content.\nContent Creation and Management\nUbiquitous computing research is inherently concerned with applications\nand the user experience. Thus, the nature and quality of content presented\nby ubiquitous computing systems is of critical importance. Systems such as\nGUIDE [1], Can You See Me Now [4] and Uncle Roy All Around [7] have\nclearly demonstrated the benefits in user experience that are accrued from\ndeveloping high-quality content for use in ubiquitous computing applica-\ntions. For our e-Campus deployments the role of content was critical since\nfor most users the content is the system. Whenever we didn\u2019t have content\nto display and turned off the displays people assumed the system was bro-\nken. Similarly, poor content reflected very badly on the system as a whole.\nOur eighth lesson drawn from our experiences with numerous projects is\nthus \u201cnever underestimate the importance of content\u201d.\nGenerating compelling content is a non-trivial task and in our experience\ncomputer scientists lack the necessary expertise to produce such content (of\ncourse there are exceptions but these are few and far between). This is not\nsimply a matter of artistic talent - producing content often requires special-\nized knowledge of tools and processes that are outside the remit of computer\nscience. Furthermore, while many students and staff can justify working on\nsystems infrastructure or user studies as part of their research, finding time\nto work on what is often (incorrectly) regarded as a luxury, i.e. content\ngeneration, is much more problematic. While there are lots of techniques\nthat can be used to try and generate content with few resources (e.g. user\ncontributed content, employing students etc.) even these techniques incur\nsignificant management overheads. In our deployments we have used content\nranging from that developed by ourselves through user contributed video and\ntext entries to professionally created performance pieces. Whichever ap-\nproach is used our ninth lesson holds: \u201censure you have adequate resources\nset aside for content creation\u201d. We use resources in its broadest sense here\nto encompass both money and staff with the appropriate skill set.\n8\nIn our deployments we were already mindful of the above lessons and\nthus ensured that we had made provision for content creation. However, we\nhad not anticipated the difficulty we had managing the content once it had\nbeen created. For example, in the Brewery deployment we ended up with a\nmultitude of versions of our diary entries. This reflected the need to convert\nthe media into different encodings for the various parts of the system and the\nneed to transfer the material off-site for previewing, approval and archiving.\nOur experiences have enabled us to identify a significant mismatch between\nthe capabilities of existing Content Management Systems (CMS) (from both\nthe broadcast media and the web communities) and the requirements of\na CMS for pervasive computing environments. This leads us to our tenth\nlesson: \u201cmanaging content for pervasive computing is a major task for which\nexisting tools are poorly suited\u201d. We also note that many of our problems in\nmanaging content in our deployments were related to the need to manage\nworkflows associated with the content, e.g. this content must be archived\nand approved for display before being scheduled. Our eleventh lesson is thus\n\u201cwith the need to manage content comes the need to manage workflows in\nmobile and pervasive environments\u201d.\nOrchestrating Ubiquitous Computing Experiences\nAs computer scientists motivated by the ubicomp vision we have found our-\nselves often tempted to distribute the intelligence in the systems we build\nto as many low-level components as possible. Thus our system architec-\ntures typically appear as collections of fairly autonomous entities without\nan obvious central point of control \u2013 in the case of e-Campus these entities\nare displays and associated components. However, our experiences suggest\nthat it is crucial that whatever the architecture chosen the system should\nbe able to support the creation of carefully orchestrated (i.e. coordinated)\n\u201cperformances\u201d. Such performances define the user experience for a given\nperiod of time and support for these performances were a key requirement of\nboth the Brewery and the Underpass deployments. Specifically, it is neces-\nsary in public deployments to be able to prescribe the exact user experience.\nOur twelfth lesson is thus: \u201censure that public deployments can support or-\nchestrated performances\u201d. Related to this twelfth lesson is an associated\nrequirement that these performances can be developed and tested off-line,\ni.e. away from the physical infrastructure and, crucially, in non-real time \u2013\nenabling developers to step through or fast forward performances to tweak\nthe experience of the users. In the Brewery and Underpass such facilities\nwere crucial to enable us to test a days worth of content in a few minutes.\nThis requirement translates into our next lesson:\u201censure that it is possible\nto develop orchestrated performances off-line and replay in non-real time\u201d.\nOne aspect of the types of performance we have been describing is that\nthey typically span multiple components in the ubicomp deployment \u2013 in\n9\nour case multiple displays. In our experience there was a need to provide\ntransaction-like semantics for manipulating groups of displays. For exam-\nple, we needed to be able to allocate content to a collection of displays and\nonly display this content iff we could do so on all of the displays simulta-\nneously. To ensure a satisfactory experience it was essential that this could\nbe achieved without partial transitions becoming visible \u2013 essentially we\nrequired the properties of atomicity and isolation (or at least a variation\non isolation that we term visual isolation [14]). Our fourteenth lesson is\nthus: \u201censure that users do not experience partial or inconsistent changes\nin system state\u201d. We suspect that this requirement to manipulate groups of\nubicomp components and constrain the visibility of state changes general-\nizes beyond display networks such as e-Campus but this is an area of future\nresearch.\nManaging User Expectations\nDuring the course of our deployments we experienced several problems that\nwere a direct result of our failure to properly manage user expectations.\nThree examples illustrate the problem. First, we found that once the sys-\ntem was operational for a short period people assumed it would continue\nto be operational for the foreseeable future. In most of our deployments we\nneeded test periods where information was displayed on the actual displays\nin-situ but the system itself was still under development. This testing pe-\nriod caused significant confusion in the minds of the public. Secondly, once\nthe system was operational we failed to adequately communicate our access\npolices hence people either didn\u2019t contribute content because they didn\u2019t\nrealize they could or they asked for inappropriate content to be displayed.\nFinally, we note that blank displays implicitly create an expectation of con-\ntent to come (or more worryingly the perception of a broken system). This is\none area in which projections on surfaces already present in the environment\nhave a significant advantage over conventional displays. Our fifteenth lesson\nis therefore \u201cin any public ubiquitous computing deployment it is crucial to\nmanage user expectations\u201d.\nRelated to the issue of user expectations we note that a specific feature of\nwork on public displays is that the research output is, almost by definition,\nvisible to members of the public. As a result press and public interest is high.\nOur sixteenth lesson is a word of caution, \u201cprepare yourself, your team and\nyour work for public scrutiny\u201d. In practice this manifested itself for us in\nterms of numerous press interviews and the need to respond to a Freedom\nof Information Act request (this is a piece of UK legislation that enables\nmembers of the public to request information from any public body \u2013 in\nour case this was a request for the details of our spending on the Underpass\ndeployment). In the end all of the information we provided was used in a\nvery positive fashion by the recipients which was most gratifying.\n10\n4 Related Work on Display Deployments (possible\nsidebar)\nIn this section we briefly review related work on public displays to place\nour deployments in context. The largest deployments to date can be found\nwithin the commercial sector. These systems provide information and ad-\nvertising specifically tailored to local audiences in public spaces, such as\nairports, train stations and shopping centres. Such deployments are usually\nsupported by commercial signage software and hardware such as Sony\u2019s Ziris\nsystem. This system offers customers web-based tools for editing content and\nschedules (Ziris Create), solutions for transferring content and schedules to\npossibly remote sites (either using FTP or interfacing to an existing content\ndistribution network) (Ziris Transfer), playout solutions using either prori-\netary hardware and software or standard PCs (Ziris View), and web-based\ntools for management, monitoring and reporting (Ziris Manage). Around\n300 Ziris-based displays have recently been deployed to a small number of\nstores of a UK supermarket chain as a part of a six-month trial of the sys-\ntem. Displays in each store source content from a feed of 10-20 different\nchannels of revolving content.\nWe are also currently witnessing a growing number of displays deployed\nfor entertainment reasons. The BBC\u2019s \u201cBig Screens\u201d 4 are examples of\nthis type of deployment. These daylight-viewable screens provide a display\nsurface of twenty-five square metres and are currently installed in central\nlocations in six major cities in the United Kingdom. The screens provide\na rich set of media that is partly adapted to and contributed by the local\ncommunity they are installed in. While the BBC has always encouraged\ncontributions of content to the big screens, e.g. of media produced by visual\nartists, experiments are currently under way to enable the general public to\ninteract with the screens and to provide content. At this moment in time,\npeople are able to send messages the screens using their mobile phones, and\nto participate in interactive collaborative games that are based on crowd\nmovement in front of the screens.\nFinally, there are a large number of experimental deployments of public\ndisplay systems to investigate specific research questions [13, 9, 10, 2, 12,\n11, 8, 15]. Most deployments in this context tend to be rather small in\nscale and not very long lived. However, a small number of projects [6, 3]\nhave been subjected to larger-scale longitudinal studies. [3] describes the\nresults of a deployment of a small number of displays in a research lab over\ntotal a period of 14 months. In [5, 6] fellow members of the e-Campus\nproject outline their experiences gained during the iterative design and a\nlongitudinal deployment of Hermes, a digital doorplate system.\n4http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/bigscreens\n11\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper we have presented a series of sixteen lessons that we believe\nwill be valuable to researchers deploying ubicomp systems in public spaces.\nThese lessons are based on our specific experiences of deploying three public\ndisplay systems as part of the e-Campus project. However, we believe the\nlessons are likely to be generally applicable to many different types of public\nubicomp deployment.\nWe are currently embarking on a major new set of deployments of our\ndisplay system. These range from equipping all of the offices in our Depart-\nment with digital doorplates through to a second multi-projector install in\nthe foyer of our campus theater. We are using the lessons we have described\nin this paper to help ease the process of creating these new deployments.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work would not have been possible without the generous support of EP-\nSRC (GR\/N15986: The Equator project).
