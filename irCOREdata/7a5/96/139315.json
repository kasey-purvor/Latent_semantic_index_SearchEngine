The \nviscous behaviour of fluids, based on the Newtonian model had been understood for \nsome time (Navier [2] and Stokes [3]) and the formation of a fluid film between closely \nadhering bodies in relative motion was predicted through hydrodynamic action (Tower \n[4] and Reynolds [5]). Most pertinently, Grubin [6] (based on the work of Ertel) had \nprovided a hypothesis for fluid film formation, based on viscous-elastic behaviour of \nconcentrated non-conforming contacts, one that had strangely evaded the attention of \nscientists, given that Hertzian contact mechanics had already been established in 1881 [7] \nand hydrodynamics by 1896 [5]. This viscous-elastic behaviour is better known as \nelastohydrodynamics. The implications of Ertel and Grubin\u2019s hypothesis had been \nunderstood by early studies carried out by Petrusevitch [8], and Dowson and Higginson \n[9,10] for line contacts, the latter obtaining the seco dary pressure peaks that were \nsensitive to changes in load, kinematics of contact and bulk lubricant rheology. After \nDowson and Higginson\u2019s work a flurry of research led to other solutions for \nelastohydrodynamics of line contacts, for example by Archard et al [11], Stephenson and \nOsterle [12], and some included the effects of friction and thermal distribution, such as \nSternlicht et al [13] and Crook [14].  \n \nThus, by the time the committee sat in 1964, significant understanding of thin \nelastohydrodynamic films, nearly 2 orders of magnitude lower than the hydrodynamic \nfilms predicted by Reynolds existed. Soon thereafter the research would provide two \ndimensional solutions for circular and elliptical point contacts by Cameron and Gohar \n[15], Archard and Cowking [16] and Ranger et al [17]. It also transpired that the \nmechanism of elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) extends to the contact of materials \nof low elastic modulus (Dowson and Swales [18], Hooke and O\u2019Donoghue [19] and \nBaglin and Archard [20]). By the early 70s the importance of the transient nature of the \nmechanism of squeeze film action in EHL was realised, explaining the enhanced load \ncarrying capacity of these very thin films (Christiansen [21]). In time, with improved \ncomputational models, solutions for transient elastohydrodynamic phenomena have \nemerged for an assortment of contact conditions; Dowson et al [22], Ma et al [23], \nLubrecht and Venner [24], Jalali-Vahid et al [25,26], Kushwaha and Rahnejat [27,28], \nMei and Xie [29] and Balakrishnan and Rahnejat [30]). The squeeze film action has \nprovided explanations for long bearing life under oscillating conditions (Kushwaha and \nRahnejat [31]), for impact dynamics behaviour (Dowson and Jones [32], Safa and Gohar \nAc\nce\npte\nd m\nan\nus\ncri\npt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[33], and Al-Samieh and Rahnejat [34]) and most significantly for rough biotribological \ncontacts of endo-articular joints [35]. \n \nInterestingly, evolutionary progress in all sciences appears to conform to a generic \npattern; a major breakthrough, followed by the establishment of theories and principles, \nwhich precede a flurry of applications. For elastohydrodynamics, the ingenious postulate \nof Ertel and Grubin was underpinned by the theory and practice in the period 1950-1970 \nby Dowson and his contemporaries. One may refer to this period as the age of \nelastohydrodynamics.  \n \nBy the end of the 20th century it had become clear that elastohydrodynamic phenomenon \ncontributed to, and was mostly dominant in, rough contacts of wet contiguous surfaces of \nhigh or low elastic moduli, particularly under moderate to high loads. In fact, it was \nthought that the region of EHL was bounded by hydrodynamics (the upper bound) and \nboundary interactions (the lower bound). In this region and beyond to hydrodynamic \nfilms, the viscous force remains dominant in a world that can be considered as that of \nHertz and Reynolds. This was Nature\u2019s own choice (such as in endo-articular mammalian \njoints and the motion of gastropods [36,37]). However, an experiment carried out by \nChan and Horn [38] yielded the surprising result of fluid film drainage from vanishing \nnarrow smooth conjunctions in contravention of the continuity of flow condition, an \nunderpinning assumption of Reynolds hydrodynamics. Studies by Matsuoka and Kato \n[39], Al-Samieh and Rahnejat [40,41] and Al-Samieh, Rahnejat and Dowson [42] also \nrevealed localised contact deformation by a monotonic-oscillatory solvation force due to \nthe constraining effect of very proximate barriers and the molecular rheological \nbehaviour of fluids near them, rather than by any EHL pressures. It transpired that with \nlight loads and very smooth surfaces, intermolecular behaviour and surface energy effects \npromote fluid film discretisation. The implications of these findings were that the long \nheld Newtonian slow viscous flow model could not be upheld in conjunctions of \nthickness of several molecular diameter of the intervening fluid. This means that forces \nother than viscous action of fluid play the dominant role, and thus regimes other than \nelastohydrodynamics prevail and films of a few nanometres would be expected. A new \nage in tribology had dawned: nano-tribology. Understanding the balance of forces in such \nvanishing conjunctions is quite important for the growing field of micro-\nelectromechanical systems (MEMS).     \n   \nThis paper presents results for a series of rollers contacting\/impacting a flat plate with \ndecreasing roller size and diminishing gap, resulting in films of the order of micrometers \ndown to a few nanometres. Dominance of fluid viscous force and inertial dynamics \nsteadily gives way to other forces, such as intermolecular interactions, meniscus action \nand solvation\/hydration, depending on topography, free surface energy and fluid physical \nchemistry. It can then be seen that like EHL, nano-tribological phenomena have also been \none of Nature\u2019s key choices, particularly for some species (e.g. insects and geckos).      \n \n \n \n \nAc\nce\npte\nd m\nan\nus\ncri\npt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2- Elastostatic contact mechanics  \n \nFor a roller loaded against a flat plane the region adjacent to the line of contact deforms \nas the contact area expands. The new conjunction becomes approximately a very long \nnarrow rectangle for a given applied load. In fact, due to the abrupt geometrical \ndiscontinuities at the roller extremities, in practice the footprint shape is a long dumbbell \nshape, sometimes referred to as a dog-bone (see figure 1, Johns and Gohar [43] and \nMostofi and Gohar [44]). Not withstanding this important edge stress discontinuity, it is \nusual to assume an almost uniform contact pressure distribution along the length of the \nroller, a condition referred to as an ideal infinite line contact. The analysis is, therefore, \nconfined to the evaluation of the transverse pressure distribution under plane strain \ncondition. Hertz [7] considered this pressure distribution to be half an ellipse for small \nlocalised strains when a roller contacts a semi-infinite elastic half-space. For rolling \nelement bearings, however, any abrupt (sharp) edge profiles lead to generation of \npressure spikes, which means that the finite length of the contact should be taken into \naccount. As the first step, an elastostatic condition may be assumed, yielding a dry \ncontact.  \n \nFigure 1: Footprint shape of a roller indenting a semi-infinite elastic half-space \nThe contact area in figure 1 is sub-divided into a number of rectangular elements, upon \neach of which a three dimensional pressure distribution is assumed; parabolic in \ntransverse direction and isosceles in the longitudinal direction (see figure 2). Deflection \nat any point in each rectangular element due to this pressure distribution is obtained as \n[43]: \n \n2 1\n1 1\n1 12 2\n1 1 1\n(1 ) ( , )( , )\n( ) ( )\na c\na c\np x yx y dx dy\nE x x y y\n\u03c5\u03b4\n\u03c0\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212 + \u2212\n\u222b \u222b            (1) \nwhere:  \n \n2\n11 1 2\n1 1\n1\n( , ) (1 ){1 }\ny xp x y\nc a\n\u23a1 \u23a4\n= \u2212 \u2212 \u23a2 \u23a5\u23a3 \u23a6\n             (2) \nAc\nce\npte\nd m\nan\nus\ncri\npt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2: The computing element used in [43] \n \nAn analytical solution for a lateral elliptical pressure distribution can now be obtained, if \na uniform pressure distribution is also assumed over the length of the roller ( i.e. 2b), the \ndistribution being:  \n1\n22\n0 2\n0\n( ) 1 xp x p\na\n\u23a7 \u23ab\n= \u2212\u23a8 \u23ac\u23a9 \u23ad\n.

For \nlinear elastic materials, the Drucker stability condition must be satisfied. This requires the \ntensor [D] to be positive definite.

It predicts slightly \nlonger footprint (i.e. 1.4%),  with a narrower width (1.7%) than that in figure 3. Due to \nthe higher mesh density, a higher pressure spike is expected. The pressure spike is \npredicted to be around 1.9 GPa by Johns [46], as opposed to the FEA prediction of 2.3 \nGPa.

Firstly, some highly loaded contacts are coated with hard wear resistant layers, such \nas the tappets in automobile valve train systems. Analytical solutions for bonded layered \nelastic solids assume a rigid substrate and are usually applicable to thin layer thickness \n(Johnson [48], Naghieh et al [49]). Such assumptions are unnecessary for finite element \nmodels. Secondly, the model can be used for impact applications, which are prevalent in \nthe presence of backlash. The classical Hertzian impact does not take into account the \nincreased penetration at the contact extremities.  \n \n3- Contact mechanics of layered bonded solids \n \nLoad bearing surfaces are often coated with hard wear resistant layers (e.g. cam-tappet \ncontact [50], ceramic coated bearings for precision spindles) or soft lubricating layers \n(bearings for space applications). The deviant contact mechanics behaviour of these \nlayered bonded solids from the classical Hertzian theory is not always appreciated in \npractice, although much research has been devoted to this topic in academe since \nSneddon [51]. To illustrate this deviant behaviour, the contact of a typical cobalt-\nchromium roller bearing of radius 6 mm and length 12 mm (E = 210 GPa), coated with a \n40 \u03bcm layer of alumina (E = 400 GPa) is considered, subject to a load of 500 N, \nindenting a semi-infinite elastic half-space of steel. Figure 5 shows increased \nAc\nce\npte\nd m\nan\nus\ncri\npt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcentration of stresses at the edges of this unprofiled roller, when the effect of coating \nis taken into account. Hard coatings protect the substrate as they accommodate the high \nsub-surface stresses and cope better than the substrate material due to their higher yield \nstresses. The results show that the use of a hard wear resistant coating, whilst reducing \nthe pressure along most of the roller length, has the adverse effect of concentrating higher \nstresses at its ends. These induce localised sub-surface shear stresses which should \nremain within condition specified by the Tresca criterion for hard and brittle ceramic \nmaterials to avoid onset of fatigue spalling. An optimum coating thickness is required to \nensure this, as well as keeping the maximum shear stresses within the hard layer, away \nfrom its interface with the substrate material [52]. This latter point is not often \nappreciated in practice, where ad hoc applications of coatings often lead to their \nexfoliation.   \n \n \n         Figure 5: Axi-symmetric axial pressure distributions for a roller indenting a \nsemi-infinite elastic solid (Load = 500 N) \n \n4- Impact dynamics of a roller on an elastic half-space \n \nThe localised Hertzian impact of an assumed roller of mass m impacting a half-space may \nbe described as:  \nm F\u03b4 = \u2212&&           (12) \n \nwhere \u03b4  is the elastic deflection.

There is a trailing edge in figure 7 \ncaused by the crudeness of the time interval.  \n \n5- Elastohydrodynamics \n \nHaving predicted a diminished thickness of lubricant film, using his hydrodynamic \ntheory, for sufficiently high loads, Reynolds was puzzled to note absence of any wear \nscars. Nearly half a century later, Ertel and Grubin proposed an explanation for this in the \nform of combined viscous action of the lubricant (Reynolds\u2019 hydrodynamics) and \nlocalised elastic deformation of the contiguous surfaces in contact (Hertzian theory). \nFigure 8 shows a schematic representation of an EHL conjunction.  As the lubricant \nenters into the contact area its viscosity increases dramatically due to high generated \nAc\nce\npte\nd m\nan\nus\ncri\npt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npressures which deform the contiguous surfaces (localised flattening). Because of the \nusual small contact area, this localised flattening of the solids promotes a pressure rise, \nwhich follows the Hertzian ellipsoidal distribution (for the case of point contacts), giving \nrise to a nearly flat film as postulated by Grubin [6]. Due to the demands of continuity of \nflow condition, lubricant progresses towards the exit, where the pressure is at ambient, \nthus the lubricant viscosity is compelled to decrease. The thinning of the film (shown by \nminh  in the figure) reduces its localised load carrying capacity, giving rise to the \ngeneration of a pressure spike or \u201cpip\u201d, which rapidly falls-off  to ambient conditions (not \nincluded in Grubin\u2019s work, but determined by subsequent numerical analyses). The \npresence of pressure spike was predicted by Petrusevitch [8] and Dowson and Higginson \n[9,10] from the outset of numerical predictions and has consistently featured ever since in \nall the subsequent analyses. This hypothesis provided an answer for the absence of wear \nnoted by Reynolds, and as noted in section 1 has led to a fundamental theory which \nthroughout the years has explained the behaviour of, not only man-made machines, but \nmany of natural load bearing conjunctions.             \n \n \nFigure 8: Elastohydrodynamic conjunction \n \nOptical interferometry (see Tolanski [53]) has been used to observe the contours of \nlubricant film. For point contacts (for example a ball against an optically flat surface) \nthey show, in accord with the Ertel and Grubin postulate,  a flat central oil film shape, \nwith a horse-shoe constriction (region of minimum film thickness, minh ) at the outlet \nregion of the Hertzian contact footprint (see figure 9).  \n \n \nEntraining \nmotion \nAc\nce\npte\nd m\nan\nus\ncri\npt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(i)- Starved contact   (ii)- Flooded contact  \nFigure 9: Interferograms of oil film contours  \n(after Gohar [54] and Jalali-Vahid et al [25]) \n \nThe shape of EHL pressure distribution is also obtained, using pressure sensitive \nminiature transducers (such as those reported by Johns-Rahnejat and Gohar [55] and Safa \nand Gohar [33], to resolve the pressure spike. Johns-Rahnejat [56] obtained cross-\nsectional pressure distributions, using a Manganin pressure transducer deposited on an \noptically flat glass race of a 3-ball interferometer on the track of a passing steel ball under \nload. By altering the track of the ball, she obtained a series of such transient cross-\nsectional pressure traces, within the Hertzian region and beyond on the shoulders of the \ncontact. Noting that the inlet meniscus to the contact forms a section of a conic, in line \nwith Prandtl-Hopkins zero reverse boundary condition, she used Tipei\u2019s [57] \nmathematical formulation of the same to determine the inlet meniscus shape and the \ncorresponding wake-flow lines at the outlet beyond the Hertzian circle (see figure 10), \nwhere fingers of air cavitate in the lubricant. Carefully laying the obtained pressure traces \nin the direction of entraining motion between these boundaries resulted in the first ever \nrecording of a measured three-dimensional EHL transient pressure distribution in the \nform of an isobar (see figure 10). The region of pressure spike in the vicinity of the \ncontact exit boundary, at the rear of the Hertzian region corresponds to the horse-shoe \nconstriction. The overall shape of the isobar is reminiscent of the keyhole shape of the \ncontact, observed in some interferograms, for example by Wedeven [58].  \n \n \n \nFigure 10: Measured pressure isobars laid according to Prandtl-Hopkins condition \n[55,56] \n \nReturning to the main theme of contact of a roller against a semi-infinite elastic half-\nspace, it is quite clear that EHL pressure spikes also form at the contact extremities (side \nconstrictions), aside from those at the outlet of the contact. In early 70s it was thought \nthat presence of a lubricant film would reduce the magnitude of these pressures.

To account for the interaction of rough \nsurfaces, Fuller and Tabor [61] proposed a normal distribution for asperity height. \nTherefore, the probability for an asperity to have the height between z and z+dz is:  \n \n( )\n2\n2\n1 exp\n22\nzz\u03c6 \u03be\u03c0\n\u239b \u239e\n= \u2212\u239c \u239f\u239d \u23a0\n        (27) \n \nThe number of participating asperities is: \n \n( )2\n1\n2 2exp 2\n2\nz\nz\nNn S z dz\u03be\u03be \u03c0= \u2212\u222b        (28) \n \nThe force between two interacting surfaces can be computed as [61,63] (see figure 12):  \n \n( )21exp\n22\nc\na\ncL\nnPF fn h d\n\u03c0\n\u221e\n\u2212\n\u0394\u239b \u239e \u23a7 \u23ab\n= \u2212 + \u0394 \u0394\u23a8 \u23ac\u239c \u239f\u0394 \u23a9 \u23ad\u239d \u23a0\u222b        (29) \n \nwhere: \n \n Pc = 3\u03c0\u03b2\u0394\u03b3 \/ 2  \n( )2\/3'9 4 3c cP E\u03b4 \u03b2 \u03b2=  \nAc\nce\npte\nd m\nan\nus\ncri\npt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u0394 = \u03b4 \/ \u03c3 ;    \u0394c = \u03b4c \/ \u03c3 ;    h = d \/ \u03c3  \n \nThe above model is referred to as the JKR model [64] which is suitable for fairly \ncompliant asperities. For stiffer asperities another model, known as the DMT [65] can be \nemployed. As Grierson et al [66] points out there is a significant interval in asperity \ncompliance between these alternative models, and others may be formulated. One notable \nmodel is that of Maguis-Dugdale [67].To differentiate between the two classical models it \nis customary to compute the Tabor parameter as: \u03bc = (\u03b21\/3\u0394\u03b3 2\/3 \/ [ \u2032E \/ 2]2\/3\u03b5)  [68, 69, 70], \nwhere \u03b5  is the acting range for the surface forces and \u0394\u03b3 = \u03b3 1 + \u03b3 2 + \u03b3 12 .  For the JKR \napproach to be used \u03bc  should be larger than 5. \n \n \n6.2- Mensicus and hydration forces in asperity interactions \n \nMany micro-mechanisms are intended to operate in normal atmosphere or in some cases \nthose in a protective atmosphere can be subject to ingression of moisture, such as MEMS \ngears [71]. The condensed thin layer of water can form menisci between opposing \nasperities on conjunctional surfaces. These menisci can add to the work of adhesion [72, \n73].   \n \nRiedo et al [74] have shown that between two very proximate dry surfaces water \ncondenses and forms a thin film (several molecular diameters thick). For micro-scale \napplications, this thin film can be neglected. However, this cannot be assumed at nano-\nscale, where the surface roughness is of the same order as that of the condensed layer of \nwater. If two asperities mutually approach to within this thin layer of condensed water, a \nnano-scale meniscus bridge would form between them. Then, the attractive meniscus \naction would tend to bring the two asperities even closer to each other.  \n \nWhen the distance between the two submerged asperities becomes quite small, a \nrepulsive hydration component can also be encountered. Hydration has an oscillatory \nbehaviour, very similar to the solvation effect near solid boundaries [41,72,74]. However, \nthis oscillatory behaviour is only noted for molecularly smooth surfaces [72] and has \nbeen traditionally studied through Monte Carlo simulations [72]. These studies have \nshown oscillatory variations in fluid density near solid molecularly smooth barriers which \ncan deviate significantly from the bulk density of a fluidic medium [38,42,72,75]. \nHydration follows a similar behaviour, variously suggested to be oscillatory monotonic. \nHowever in relatively rough contact conjunctions, the oscillatory behaviour of hydration \nis deemed insignificant, making it purely monotonic. This is in line with suggestions put \nforward by Israelachvili [72]. \n  \nThe shape of a meniscus between two asperities with equivalent radius Re, is computed \nby integrating the Young-Laplace equation: ( )1 2 01 1o i lvp p r r\u03b3\u2212 + =+ , where r1 and r2 are \nthe two radii of the meniscus [72,73]. The resultant meniscus force for a bridge is:  \n \n( )1 22 cos cosm lvf R\u03c0 \u03b3 \u03b8 \u03b8= \u2212 +        (30) \nAc\nce\npte\nd m\nan\nus\ncri\npt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhere: 1\u03b8 and 2\u03b8 are the contact angles that a film of water makes with the two contacting \nsurfaces.  \n \nThe meniscus force tends to stick the contiguous surfaces together. This is detrimental for \nMEMS gears, particularly when operating at low speeds. Thus, it is commonplace to \ncover the teeth surfaces by hydrophobic mono-layers, which self-assemble when applied, \nreferred to as self-assembled mono-layers (SAM). The contact angles made by water with \nthese mono-layers are large, indicating strong hydrophobicity, whilst for unprotected \nsilica surfaces (the material of choice for MEMS devices due to good thermal stability) \nthe contact angles are quite small (strongly hydrophilic). Therefore, the SAM inhibits the \nformation of menisci, whilst the rough silica surfaces encourage it. \n \nAt very small separation between submerged surfaces, a repulsive potential is noted. This \npotential can be considered to be an exponential decay of the form [72,75]:  \n \n( ) 0\/2 D zH lvw e\n\u03bb\u03b3 \u2212 \u2212=           (31) \n \nwhere: \n[ ] 210 50  mJ\/mlv\u03b3 \u2208 \u00f7  \n \u03bb0 \u2248 1.5 nm  (~6 times the molecule of water) \n   \nThe hydration pressure between a pair of submerged sperities is given as:  \n \n( )\n( ) 0 \/\n0\n2 D zlvHH\nwP e\nD z\n\u03bb\u03b3\n\u03bb\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2202\n= =\n\u2202 \u2212\n       (32) \n \nThe hydration force between two asperities acts through their enveloping small micro-\nmeniscus. Therefore, to quantify this force, the size of the meniscus should be computed. \nThe equilibrium meniscus curvature radius is obtained considering the relative vapour \npressure (p\/ps) as [72]: \n \n1 21 (1\/ 1\/ ) \/ log( \/ )lv sr r V RT p p\u03b3+ =       (33) \n \nwhere it is acceptable to assume that for a spherical concave water meniscus r1=r2=r \n[72]. \n \nTeodorescu and Rahnejat [76] have shown that for a surface S, considered to have a \nnormally distributed asperity height the meniscus and the hydration forces are: \n \n2\n2\n02\n0\n2\nm\nz D zD\nlv\nh\nD h\nF SN e e dz\u03bb\u03be\u03b3\n\u03c0 \u03bb \u03be\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n= \u222b        (34) \n \nand: \nAc\nce\npte\nd m\nan\nus\ncri\npt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n( )\n2\n22\n1 2\n2 cos cos\nm\nzD\nm lv\nD h\nF SNR e dz\u03be\u03c0\u03b3 \u03b8 \u03b8\u03be\n\u2212\n\u2212\n= \u2212 + \u222b       (35) \nNow, equations (34), (35) and (29) give the total contact load as:  \n \n( )a m hW F F F dxdy= + +\u222b\u222b         (36) \n \nIt is generally noted that one may broadly distinguish between the  micro-scale and nano-\nscale tribo-dynamics phenomena by the apparent loss of a continuum. Meniscus action \nand hydration as physical phenomena exist at both scales, but only become significant at \nmolecular level interactions. Therefore, a definitive boundary cannot be assumed, except \nfor the fact that most molecular behaviour are functions of the ratio of the size of a body \nto that of the system (molecule of the intervening fluid to the gap size) [72]. In the case of \nmeniscus action the height of a bridge is dependent on the layer of condensation which \ncan be computed according to saturation pressure and condensation activation time [74].   \n \nFinally, the equation of motion is obtained as: \n \nrefmh W mg= \u2212&&          (37) \n \nThe solution of this equation in suitably small time steps provides the gap refh .          \n \nClearly, classical Hertzian theory deals with the totally elastic impact of a roller on a \nsemi-infinite elastic half-space, where the kinetic energy converts to stored strain energy \nupon impact without any losses. This stored kinetic energy is then gradually converted \nback into kinetic energy upon rebound. Therefore, the centre of the roller describes a path \ndetermined by the impact force, given by the Hertzian load-deflection relationship \n3\n2F k\u03b4= . For impact of a unprotected roller (without SAM) on a rough surface (also \nunprotected), the impact kinetic energy must overcome the work of adhesion and break \nany formed micro-menisci, whilst aided at vanishing separations by the hydration \npotential. The net stored energy for rebound is therefore less than the impact kinetic \nenergy. Thus, the load-displacement characteristics differ in impact and rebound as \nshown in figure 13 (a) for the first rebound. Note that the area bounded by the impact-\nrebound loop represents the loss of energy. Such characteristics may be considered as \nhysteretic behaviour. Figure 13 (b) shows a series of rebounds until the roller comes to \nrest. When a SAM covered surface is employed, the effect of hydration is enhanced, \nwhilst that of adhesion and meniscus action are significantly reduced. Thus, the impact \nand rebound paths almost coincide (i.e. no significant loss of energy occurs, thus many \nbounces can occur), although the characteristics differ from Hertzian theory because of \nthe prevailing kinetics (see figure 14). This explains the effectiveness of the SAM \nprotected MEMS gears (particularly at lower speeds), but use of Hertzian theory is not \npermissible. The roller and the height from which it is released is chosen to represent \ntypical impact conditions experienced in MEMS gears.  \n \nAc\nce\npte\nd m\nan\nus\ncri\npt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReturning to the case of unprotected surfaces, figure 15 shows that the loss of energy due \nto the work of adhesion reduces the rebound velocity, until an insufficient impact energy \nexists to overcome the combined effect of meniscus attraction of asperity pairs and their \nadhesion. In effect there is a limiting velocity needed for the roller to bounce, which may \nbe considered as the escape velocity for any combination of rough impacting wet solids.     \n \n    \na)       b) \n \nFigure 13: Impact and rebound in a nano-scale conjunction \n \n \n \n \nFigure 14: Impact-rebound characteristics in nano-scale for a  \nhydrophobic surface \n \n \nAc\nce\npte\nd m\nan\nus\ncri\npt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 15: Impact and rebound velocities for multiple bounces  \n \nIt is clear that unlike micro-scale conjunctions nano-scale asperity interaction is affected \nby asperity pair adhesion as well as by effect of micro-scale menisci between them, under \nnormal atmosphere. Other effects such as van der Waal\u2019s interaction and hydration at \nvery close range also play a role.      \n \n7- Concluding Remarks \n \nThis paper provides a brief review of some of the tribo-dynamics phenomena. It shows \nhow evolving knowledge has paved the way for the understanding and in some cases \ndesign of machines and mechanisms with progressively thinner lubricant film \nconjunctions. In Reynolds\u2019 time, film thicknesses of the order of tens of micrometer \nexisted in rather crude bearings. The steadily falling oil film thickness and better design \nof bearings reported by Dowson [1] have been as a result of the evolving understanding \nof elastohydrodynamic phenomenon. Thus, as Dowson [77] has pointed out \u201ctalk of sub-\nmicrometer films in a number of situations  \u2026. has become commonplace\u201d. With lightly \nloaded contacts ultra-thin films have been noted [39,40]. It has also become clear that the \nmechanisms giving rise to formation of these thin films are dependent upon physical \nchemistry of intervening fluids and surface energy effects, rather than the usual piezo-\nviscous action. The whole new area of nano-tribology is now open to further fundamental \nresearch, with emerging and growing applications in MEMS devices. Furthermore, a new \narea of bio-inspired nano-tribology is fast emerging [78-80], in which some of the force \nlaws described in this paper play significant roles. Elastohydrodynamics is still a \ndeveloping area of research, where thin films formed on thin bonded layers, such as \ncoatings need careful investigation. In nano-conjunctions fundamental studies of \ncompeting force laws are still in their infancy.  \n \n8- References: \n \n[1] Dowson, D.
