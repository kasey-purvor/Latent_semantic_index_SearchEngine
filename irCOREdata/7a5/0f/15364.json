INTRODUCTION\nThe UK is facing twin challenges of climate change and security\nof energy supply. To meet these challenges, UK government is\ndeveloping a strategy of having a diverse mix of low-carbon\nenergy sources, in which renewable sources will play a vital\npart. A component of that strategy was the development from\n2001 of round 1 offshore wind farms, as presented in Figure 1\nand Table 1.\nIn March 2007, the European Union (EU) Council of Ministers\nagreed that renewable energy should meet at least 20% of EU\nenergy demand by 2020. In December 2008, UK agreed to a\nlegally binding target for 15% of energy production from\nrenewable sources by 2020, increasing from 1.5% in 2006 (DECC,\n2009a, p. 4). Offshore wind power is intended to play an\nimportant part in meeting these UK renewable energy targets,\nimproving energy security and reducing carbon emission by 2020.\nThe consultative document published by the Department for\nBusiness, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) in June\n2008 showed that offshore wind power could contribute up to\n19% of the UK renewable energy target by 2020 (BERR, 2008,\np. 8). In June 2009, the Department of Energy and Climate\nChange (DECC) announced a new plan for 25GW of new\noffshore wind capacity, on top of existing plans for 8GW\n(DECC, 2009a, p. 2). In January 2010, The UK\u2019s Crown Estate\nhas announced the successful bidders for the round 3 which is\nanticipated to take the development of at least 25GW offshore\nwind capacity.\nThe UK has a rich offshore wind resource and the deployment of\nlarge-scale offshore wind power could have some advantages.\nOffshore wind speeds are higher, turbulence is less and offshore\nwind turbines should expect a larger energy capture than\nequivalent onshore machines. The noise impact of offshore wind\nfarms is less than onshore and their visual impact is perceived\nto be less. However, there are concerns about offshore wind in\nthe UK owing to the lack of operating experience on large-scale\noffshore wind farms and the possible risks of energy capture\nowing to low reliability and availability, in view of the\ndifficulties of accessing offshore turbines for maintenance. In\n2001 the \u2018Offshore wind capital grants scheme\u2019 was launched by\nthe Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to encourage the\ndeployment of large-scale offshore wind farms. Five projects\nwith a total capacity of 390MW of round 1 offshore wind\nfarms, supported by the scheme, are now fully operational,\nincluding the UK\u2019s first major offshore wind farms North Hoyle\n(Carter, 2007), Scroby Sands, Kentish Flats, Barrow and Burbo\nBank. Figure 2 presents a view of Scroby Sands offshore wind\nfarm from the beach, demonstrating that these sites are all close\ninshore. These projects were designed to provide valuable\nexperience for the upcoming larger offshore wind projects in\nrounds 2 and 3. From 2005, the annual operational reports of\nround 1 offshore wind farms have been published by DTI,\nsubsequently BERR (DTI and BERR, 2004\u20132007).\nOperational performance is critical to the economics of a wind\nfarm. This is because the operation and maintenance (O&M)\ncosts constitute a sizable share of the annual cost of a wind\nfarm and turbine downtime, owing to repair or maintenance,\ncauses an annual energy production loss. This paper analyses\nearly operational data from the available reports of round 1\noffshore wind farms, placing them in context alongside the\npublished performance of onshore wind farms in Europe and\ntheir own early operational issues.\nThe paper is organised as follows: Section 2 explains the\nterminologies used. Section 3 describes the background of\nEnergy 163 Issue EN0 Early experiences with UK round 1 offshore wind farms Feng et al. 1\nrecent onshore wind turbine operational studies, based on public\nand commercial databases. Section 4 records the operational\nissues experienced at each of round 1 offshore wind farms.\nSection 5 presents economic and operational analyses based on\nthe round 1 reports and previous experience; it then goes on to\nexplain the observed performance and proposes suggestions for\nfuture improvement in Section 6. Section 7 draws conclusions.\n2. TERMINOLOGY\nCost of energy (COE) is commonly used to evaluate the\neconomic performance of different wind farms. This\nmethodology was adopted in a joint report (IEA et al., 2005,\np. 173) by the IEA (International Energy Agency), the European\nOECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment) and US NEA (Nuclear Energy Agency), referred to\nFigure 1. UK round 1 offshore wind farms (produced by Design & Imaging Unit, Durham University\nQ12\n)\n2 Energy 163 Issue EN0 Early experiences with UK round 1 offshore wind farms Feng et al.\nin this paper as the \u2018IEA 2005 report\u2019. It compares the cost of\ndifferent electricity production options. A simplified calculation\nequation is adopted in the US to calculate the COE (\u00a3\/MWh) for\na wind turbine system (Walford, 2006)\nCOE \u00bc ICC\u0001 FCR\u00fe O&Mcos t\nE\n2\nwhere ICC is initial capital cost (\u00a3), FCR is annual fixed charge\nrate (%), E is annual energy production (kWh), O&M cost is\nannual operation and maintenance cost (\u00a3). The result of this\napproach is the same as that of levelised electricity generation\ncost used in IEA 2005 report (p. 174), where the parameter FCR\nis a function of the discount rate r used in the IEA 2005 report,\nas follows\nFCR \u00bc r\u00bd1\u0002 \u00f01\u00fe r\u00de\u0002n\u00032\nwhere r 6\u00bc 0.\nThe discount rate r is the sum of inflation and real interest\nrates. If inflation is ignored, the discount rate equals the\ninterest rate. For the special case of a discount rate r\u00bc 0,\nunlikely in the real world, FCR will be ICC divided by the\neconomic lifetime of the wind farm in years, currently\nestimated at 20 years.\nIt is essential to clarify the definition of availability. Since 2007,\nan IEC working group has been working to produce a standard\nto define availability. Until that standard is published, there is\nno internationally agreed definition of availability (Harman\net al., 2008). However, two availability definitions have been\ngenerally adopted in the reports (DTI and BERR, 2004\u20132007)\nand are summarised below.\n(a) Technical availability, also known as system availability\n(Harman et al., 2008), is the percentage of time that an\nindividual wind turbine\/wind farm is available to generate\nelectricity expressed as a percentage of the theoretical\nmaximum.\n(b) Commercial availability, also known as turbine availability\n(Harman et al., 2008), is the focus of commercial contracts\nbetween wind farm owners and wind turbine manufacturers\nLocation Status Capa- Period : Turbine Water Distance from Operator\ncity: reported depth: wind farm\nMW year No Maker Type Rating:\nMW\nSwept\narea: m\nm centre to\nshore: km\nNorth Hoyle Operational\n( July 2004)\n60 3 30 Vestas V80 2 5027 7\u201311 9.2 RWE npower\nRenewables\nScroby Sands Operational\n( Jan 2005)\n60 3 30 Vestas V80 2 5027 5\u201310 3.6 E.on UK\nRenewables\nKentish Flats Operational\n( Jan 2006)\n90 2 30 Vestas V90 3 6362 5 9.8 Vattenfall\nBarrow Operational\n( July 2006)\n90 1 30 Vestas V90 3 6362 15\u201320 12.8 Centrica\/\nDONG Energy\nBurbo Bank Operational\n(Oct 2007)\n90 25 Siemens SWT-3.6-107 3.6 9000 2\u20138 8 DONG Energy\nRhyl Flats Partial\noperational\n( July 2009)\n90 25 Siemens SWT-3.6-107 3.6 9000 6.5\u2013\n12.5\n10.7 RWE npower\nRenewables\nLynn\/Inner\nDowsing\nInstalled\n( July 2008)\n194 54 Siemens SWT-3.6-107 3.6 9000 5\u201310\/\n18.6\u201326\n6.9\/6.2 Centrica\nRenewable\nEnergy\nGunfleet\nSands I\nUnder\nconstruction\n108 30 Siemens SWT-3.6-107 3.6 9000 0.5\u201310 7.4 DONG Energy\nRobin Rigg Under\nconstruction\n180 60 Vestas V90 3 6362 0\u201320 11.5 E.on Climate &\nRenewables UK\n* See http:\/\/www.bwea.com\/offshore\/round1.html, accessed on August 2009\ny See http:\/\/www.4coffshore.com\/windfarms, accessed on August 2009\nTable 1.

Some commercial contracts may exclude downtime\nfor agreed items, such as requested stops, scheduled repair\ntime, grid faults and severe weather, when wind turbines\ncannot operate normally.\nFor the rest of the paper, the term \u2018availability\u2019 refers to the\ntechnical or system availability, as defined above. It lends itself\nto comparison from project to project (Harman et al., 2008).\nFrom above definitions, it follows that technical or system\navailability will be always lower than the turbine or commercial\navailability because there is more alleviation of downtime for\nthe latter.\nCapacity factor and specific energy yield are two commonly\nused terms describing the productivity of a wind turbine or\nwind farm. Capacity factor is defined as the percentage of the\nactual annual energy production E (kWh) over the rated annual\nenergy production from a wind turbine or wind farm (Hau,\n2006, p. 530)\nCapacity factor \u00bc E\nrated power \u0001 8760\u0001 100%3\nSpecific energy yield (kWh\/m\/year) is defined as the annual\nenergy production of a wind turbine normalised to the swept\nrotor area (m2) of the turbine\nSpecific energy yield \u00bc E\nswept rotor area\n4\nThe ratio of rated power over swept rotor area is a fixed value\nfor a type of wind turbine\nRatiors \u00bc\nrated power\nswept rotor area\n5\nor\nRatiors \u00bc\nspecific energy yield\ncapacity factor \u0001 87606\nFor a specific type of wind turbine, the specific energy yield is\nproportional to the capacity factor\nSpecific energy yield \u00bc ratiors \u0001 capacity factor \u0001 87607\nTherefore, the operational performance factor of a wind turbine\nor wind farm can be defined as the percentage of the achieved\ncapacity factor (or specific energy yield) over the expected\ncapacity factor (or expected specific energy yield)\nPerformance factor \u00bc achieved capacity factor\nexpected capacity factor\n8\nor\nPerformance factor \u00bc achieved specific energy yield\nexpected specific energy yield\n9\n3. BACKGROUND\nQuantitative reliability studies of onshore wind turbine\noperation have been carried out recently (Harman et al., 2008;\nSpinato et al., 2009; Tavner et al., 2006). The objectives of these\nstudies were to extract information from existing commercial or\npublic databases to understand wind turbine reliability from a\nstatistical point of view and provide a benchmark for future\nanalysis.\nHarman et al. (2008) shed light on the availability by\nconsidering a commercial database representing turbines of\n14 000MW operating in onshore wind farms, approximately\n15% of the total worldwide installed capacity. The work focused\non the annual availability risks of wind farms. The results\nshowed that the mean average annual availability of onshore\nwind farms over their economic lifetime, that is 20 years, was\napproximately 97%. The probability of a wind farm annual\navailability being less than 80% is low at 1%. The availability\nrises from 93% in the first quarter of first year operation to over\n96% after the end of the second year. The availability, studied\nfrom the 10min average SCADA data, remains relatively\nconstant for wind speeds between 7 and 14m\/s and it is in this\nrange that the majority of energy is delivered. However, the\navailability reduces at wind speeds above 14m\/s and at low\nwind speeds below 7m\/s. At high winds above 14m\/s, high load\nfaults may be more common causing a reduction in availability;\nwhile at low winds below 7m\/s, downtime may be associated\nwith non-urgent maintenance activities which have been\nscheduled for periods of low wind.\nCommercial databases are not open to public scrutiny for\nconfidentiality reasons. Tavner et al. (2006) published a\ncomprehensive study of wind turbine reliability based on\npublicly available Windstats data investigated over 10 years of\nmodern wind turbine operation, paying particular attention to\n904 Danish and 4285 German turbines, representing about\n15000MW and 46500 turbine-years in total. The investigation\nfocused on reliability because that depends intrinsically upon the\nturbine itself and should therefore be predictable. The study\nanalysed in detail how turbine design, configuration, time and\nweather affected reliability. This research was later extended\n(Spinato et al., 2009) to a study of the reliability of wind turbine\nsubassemblies, which paid particular attention to 1740 turbines in\nGermany representing about 1500MW and 21200 turbine-years.\nOperational data in the public domain from relatively new\noffshore projects are rare compared to data collected from\nonshore projects developed from the 1980s to date. The\noperational reports published under the \u2018Offshore wind capital\ngrants scheme\u2019 (DTI and BERR, 2004\u20132007) have provided an\nopportunity to learn about offshore wind turbine experience\nthrough quantitative study and comparison with the\naccumulated onshore data. Table 2 shows the population\ninformation, including the relative size and significance of the\ndata in this paper in relation to the studies already completed.\n4.

Monthly data of UK offshore wind farm (July 2004\u2013December 2007)\nEnergy 163 Issue EN0 Early experiences with UK round 1 offshore wind farms Feng et al. 5\n4.1. Scroby Sands\nIn 2005 there was substantial unplanned work attributed to\nminor commissioning issues, corrected by remote turbine resets,\nlocal turbine resets or minor maintenance work, mostly resolved\nwithin a day. A smaller number of unplanned works involved\nlarger-scale plant problems with more serious implications, the\nprimary cause being gearbox bearings.\nIn 2005 27 generator side intermediate speed shaft bearings and\n12 high-speed shaft bearings were replaced. A number of\nreasons for the gearbox bearing damage were identified related\nto the bearing designs.\nIn 2005 four generators were replaced with generators of\nalternative design.\nIn 2006 unplanned work involved three outboard intermediate\nspeed shaft gearbox bearings, nine high-speed shaft gearbox\nbearings and eight generator failures. Generating capacity was\nalso significantly reduced for two months when one of the three\ntransition joints in the cable to the beach failed.\nIn 2007 problems experienced with the generators were resolved\nby replacing all original generators with a generator of proven\ndesign. The gearbox bearing issue was managed in the short term\nby proactive replacement of the outboard intermediate speed\nbearings, in addition 12 high-speed shaft bearings were identified\nas worn during routine internal inspections and proactively\nreplaced before failure. Three gearboxes were also identified as\nrequiring replacement. Capacity was also affected by a transition\njoint failure in another cable to the beach, commissioning tests\nalso identified a fault in the sub-sea portion of the cable, for\nwhich replacement was planned for spring 2008.\n4.2. North Hoyle\nIn 2004\u20135 unplanned work involved a high voltage cable fault,\ngenerator faults associated with cable connections and SCADA\nelectrical faults.\nIn 2006 the following issues arose\n(a) two generator bearing faults\n(b) six gearbox faults\n(c) an unplanned grid outage\n(d ) preparation and return of turbines to service further\nextended down time\n(e) downtime owing to routine maintenance and difficulties in\nthe means of access to the turbines.\nIn 2007 the following issues arose\n(a) four gearbox bearing faults and chipped teeth resulting in\ngearbox replacements delayed by the lack of a suitable\nmaintenance vessel\n(b) two generator rotor cable faults\n(c) two circuit breaker failures\n(d ) one cracked hub strut\n(e) one turbine outage for yaw motor failures\n( f ) an unplanned grid outage\n(g) again downtime owing to difficulties in the means of access.\n4.3. Kentish Flats\nIn 2006 there was substantial initial unplanned work\nattributed to minor commissioning issues corrected by remote\nturbine resets, local turbine resets or minor maintenance work.\nOther unplanned work involved larger-scale plant problems\nincluded\n(a) main gearbox\n(b) generator bearings\n(c) generator rotor cable connections from the slipring unit\n(d ) pitch system.\nThe generator bearing and rotor cable problems were prolonged\nas the generator sub-supplier undertook the repairs to avoid\njeopardising the warranty.\nThe first main gearbox damage was detected in late 2006 and\nan intensive endoscope campaign revealed that 12 gearboxes\nrequired exchange. In 2007 all 30 gearboxes were exchanged\nowing to incipient bearing failures in the planetary gear. The\nexchange programme was scattered over the year, and due to\nwaiting time and the lack of a crane ship, the outages were\nlonger than the repair time. About half of the generators were\nrefurbished owing to\n(a) damage on internal generator rotor cable connections\n(b) shaft tolerances\n(c) grounding of bearings to avoid current passage.\nOther unplanned tasks included\n(a) pitch system repair\n(b) blade repair on one turbine due to crane impact during\ngearbox exchange.\n4.4 Barrow\nIn 2006\u20132007 unplanned work on the turbines was substantial\nalthough some issues were minor, solved by a local reset or\nminor work to the turbine. Other larger issues were\n(a) generator bearings failed and replaced with a new type\n(b) generator rotor cables replaced with a new type\n(c) pitch systems modified.\nOwing to gearbox problems seen on other turbines of the same\ntype an inspection process commenced in 2007 showing a few\ngearboxes beginning to show similar problems. It was decided\nproactively to replace gearboxes before failure and this started\nin July 2007 completing in October 2007.\n5. RESULTS\n5.1. Capacity factor and availability\nTable 3 shows the average operational performance of the four\noffshore wind farms for 2004\u20137. The figures are calculated\nusing the data published in the reports and the annual averages\nare weighted taking account of the number of reporting year for\neach wind farm.\nThe comparison that can be made between the four offshore\nwind farms and for the period reported is as follows\n(a) Barrow has a low availability of 67.4%, low capacity factor\nof 24.1% with higher average wind speed, much of which\nmay be attributable to the generator, gearbox and pitch\nsystem issues recoded above bearing in mind that only one\nyear\u2019s performance has been reported.\n(b) Scroby Sands and Kentish Flats are similar with\navailabilities of \u000480%, capacity factors of \u000427% and\nannual average wind speeds of \u00048m\/s.\n6 Energy 163 Issue EN0 Early experiences with UK round 1 offshore wind farms Feng et al.\n(c) North Hoyle has the highest availability of 87.7% and\ncapacity factor of 35% despite the operational experiences\nrecorded above.\nThe annual average availability for UK round 1 offshore wind\nfarm for the reported period is low at only 80.2%, lower than\nthe availability reported by Harman et al. (2008) achieved by\nonshore wind farms at 97% and lower than a typical EU\nestablished offshore wind farm, Middelgrunden, calculated at\n93.3% based on data provided by Larsen et al. (2005). However,\nthese data from UK round 1 wind farms were collected during\nperiods of early operation.\nThe annual average capacity factor for reporting UK round 1\noffshore wind farms is 29.5%, higher than the average value of\n27.3% reported in 2007 for UK onshore wind farms (DECC,\n2009b) but lower than the expected 35.0% estimated from EU\noffshore wind farms. The latter being based on Horns Rev,\nDenmark 33%, Nysted, Denmark 40% (IEA, 2005), Sams\u00f8,\nDenmark 38% (see http:\/\/www.samsohavvind.dk\/windfarm\/),\nEgmond aan Zee, Netherlands 35% (Noordzee Wind, 2008) and\nMiddelgrunden, Denmark 27% (Svenson and Larsen, 2008) as\nsummarised in 0 (Figure 4).\nThe ratio of rated power over swept rotor area Ratiors is\n398W\/m for a V80 turbine and 472W\/m for a V90 turbine.\nFrom Equation 7, the expected specific energy yields for these\ntwo types of turbine are quite different, even though the\ncapacity factors expected from them, based on European\nexperience, should be the same at 35%. The expected specific\nenergy yield for a V80 is calculated to be 1220 kWh\/m\/year and\nfor a V90 turbine 1446 kWh\/m\/year. For the wind farms with\nthe same type of turbine, the specific energy yield varies with\nthe availability as shown in Table 3. For example, the specific\nenergy yield of North Hoyle is greater than that of Scroby Sands\nowing to higher capacity factor and availability.\nTo compare wind farms with different types of turbine, the\nperformance factor defined in Equations 8 and 9 is suggested.\nAlthough the absolute value of the specific energy yield of\nScroby Sands (943 kWh\/m\/year) is much lower than that of\nKentish Flats (1146 kWh\/m\/year), the performance factor of\nScroby Sands is at 77.4% which is very close to that of Kentish\nFlats at 79.1%. The performance factors for North Hoyle and\nBarrow are 100% and 68.9% respectively.\n5.2. Cost of energy\nTable 4 shows the COE, capital cost, O&M cost, percentage of\nO&M cost over COE of the four UK round 1 reporting offshore\nwind farms. The figures are calculated using the data published\nin the reports at a discount rate 10%. In the absence of other\ninformation the discount rate adopted throughout the paper will\nbe 10%, close to the FCR of 11.85% used by US NREL in some\nstudies (see http:\/\/www.nrel.gov\/wind\/coe.html). The COE\naverage and O&M cost average are weighted taking account of\nthe number of reporting year for each wind farm.\nThe discount rate has a big impact on the COE estimation.\nAnalysis of the sensitivity of offshore wind COE to the discount\nTurbine\ntype\nAnnual average\nwind speed: m\/s\nSpecific energy\nyield: kWh\/m\/year\nCapacity factor:\n%\nPerformance\nfactor: %\nAvailability:\n%\nBarrow V90 9.15 996 24.1 68.9 67.4\nNorth Hoyle V80 8.36 1220 35.0 100.0 87.7\nScroby Sands V80 8.08 943 27.1 77.4 81.0\nKentish Flats V90 7.88 1146 27.7 79.1 80.4\nAnnual average 29.5 80.2\nTable 3.

When the discount rate increases\nby 1%, the COE increases by \u0004\u00a33.60 per MWh, or \u00047%.\nTo provide a benchmark comparison of wind turbine COE\nperformance we estimate the COE for coal- and gas-fired plants\nwith carbon capture storage systems (CCS) by adopting the\nmedian values reported by DTI in 2006 (DTI, 2006), where\napproximately the COE for coal with CCS was \u00a345 per MWh and\nfor gas with CCS was \u00a356 per MWh, in which the assumption of\ndiscount rate at 10%, median prices for coal of \u00a325\/t, for gas of\n37p\/therm and for carbon dioxide \u20ac36\/t were made.\nNote that DECC and BERR regularly update their fuel and\ncarbon dioxide price assumptions. In May 2009, the latest\ncommunication, the assumed price in 2015 for coal was \u00a348\/t,\nwith a GB pound \u00a3: US dollar $ exchange rate of 1 :1.65 in\n2009, and for gas 63p\/therm, predicted for moderate global\nenergy demand (DECC, 2009c). These price assumptions are\nalmost the double those cited by DTI in 2006.\nTherefore, the COE estimations adopted here for fossil-fired\nplant are likely increase dramatically in the future. The latest\nprice assumption for carbon dioxide made by BERR on April\n2009 was \u20ac34\/t, close to the figure cited by DTI in 2006.\nKrohn et al. (2009) has suggested a risk-based model for\ncomparing power generating cost of different technologies by\ntaking into account the fuel and carbon price risk. Fuel and\ncarbon prices are highly unpredictable and have added extra\nrisk cost to the basic estimation of the COE for coal and gas.\nWhereas for wind power the fuel is free and is classified in cost\nestimation as a low-risk fuel. Based on the estimation made for\nthe EU, the historic fuel price has been assumed, a \u2018no-cost 40\nyear fuel purchase\u2019 contract and a proportional fuel risk cost\nadded to the basic COE estimation of coal-fired or gas-fired\nplant for UK.\nFor the COE of coal with CCS, the historic fuel risk and \u2018no-cost\n40 year fuel purchase\u2019 will each increase the basic estimation by\n108% and 65% respectively. For the COE of gas with CCS, the\nhistoric fuel risk and no-cost contract will each increase the\nbasic estimation by 85% and 65%, respectively.\nA comparison between the COE of the two fossil fuel options\nabove, the current COE for onshore wind farms given by E.ON\nat mean \u00a347 per MWh in the report to House of Commons\n(2006) and the average COE results from the four reporting UK\noffshore wind farms are shown in Figure 6 together with their\nsensitivity to the fuel risk. The figure shows the strategic\neconomic advantage for onshore and offshore wind energy, in\nthat the COE remains unchanged because the technology carries\nno fuel price risk.\nA comparison is made in Figure 7 between the COE of the\nreporting UK offshore wind farms and EU wind farms based on\nthe discount rate at 10%. The average COE for several Danish\noffshore wind farms (Krohn et al., 2009, p. 67); that is,\nMiddelgrunden, Horns Rev I, Sams\u00f8 and Nysted is calculated at\n\u00a3104 per MWh with discount rate 10% using a GB pound \u00a3:\nEuro \u20ac exchange rate of 1:1.5 for year 2006. The COE of EU\nonshore is \u00a380 per MWh for a coastal site at discount rate 10%\n(Krohn et al., 2009, p. 60). As shown in Figure 7, the COE of UK\nor EU offshore wind farm is generally higher than that of\nonshore wind farm by \u00a322\u201324 per MWh.\nCO\nE:\n \n\u00a3\/\nM\nW\nh\n5% discount rate 7\u00b75% discount rate 12\u00b75% discount rate10% discount rate\n51\n60\n(+17%)\n79\n(+55%)69\n(+35%)\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nFigure 5.

O&M costs\nTable 4 showed the average O&M cost as a percentage of COE\nfor an offshore wind farm in UK. The average O&M cost of UK\nround 1 offshore wind farms is calculated from this paper to be\n\u00a312 per MWh. For the UK offshore wind farms, annual\noperation and maintenance cost includes land rental, electricity\ncharges, site maintenance and service fees, insurance,\nmanagement fees and miscellaneous charges (Greig, 2004). A\ncomparison of the percentage of O&M and fuel costs in the COE\nis given in Figure 8.\nThe cost percentages related to UK coal and gas, onshore wind\ntechnologies are estimated based on the data published by PB\nPower in 2006. Offshore wind power is a capital-intensive\ntechnology but the fuel is free. The variable costs of wind farm\nare much lower than that of the conventional fossil fuel-fired\ntechnologies in which as much as 37\u201373% of the COE are\nrelated to the fuel and O&M costs. The percentage O&M cost of\nUK offshore wind farms, at 18%, is higher than that of UK\nonshore wind, at 12%, but is not as high as the premium for\noffshore wind O&M costs which is suggested by some early\nmodels, accounting the percentage O&M cost as 25\u201330% or the\ntwo to three times of onshore O&M costs (Marsh, 2007). A\nreason for this disparity may be that some EU authors have\nincluded the revenue losses owing to maintenance downtime.\nHowever, this would double-count revenue losses which, when\nthe calculation is per MWh, should have already been factored\ninto the annual energy production E. It should be noted that the\noptimisation of offshore O&M strategies aims at minimising\nboth the O&M and revenue loss costs. Occasionally, some\nauthors might have quoted the COE values rather than O&M\ncosts. The COE of offshore EU offshore wind farm is 2.2 times of\nthat of the UK onshore costs, as shown in 0.\nThe components of O&M costs in Europe, which are similar to\nthose in UK, also do not include the revenue losses (Krohn et al.,\n2009). The O&M cost of Middelgrunden offshore wind farm,\nestablished in 2000, was reported as approximately \u20ac16 per\nMWh (Svenson et al., 2008). The O&M cost percentage of\nMiddelgrunden at 24% is higher than for the reporting UK\noffshore wind farms at 18%, but this contained an unexpected\ntransformer-related cost. If the transformer-related cost was\nexcluded, the O&M percentage of COE for Middelgrunden would\nbe 18%, the same as the UK offshore.\n5.4. Interaction between capital and O&M costs, capacity\nfactor, availability\nTable 4 shows the capital costs at North Hoyle and Barrow were\nhigher, owing to increased construction costs associated with\nfurther distance offshore and deeper water. The capital cost of\nBarrow was the highest while the O&M cost was the lowest. The\ncapital and O&M costs of North Hoyle were both high. The\ncapital and O&M costs of Scroby Sand and Kentish Flats were\nboth lower than North Hoyle.\nThe data from Tables 2 and 3 show when the O&M cost was\nhigher the availability and capacity factor were higher. When\nthe capital cost was high, the wind farm itself must work harder\nto achieve a low COE for an acceptable payback time. The only\nway that a wind farm can improve its capacity factor is through\nthe higher availability since there is little control over wind\nspeeds. The outcomes of this effort are shown in North Hoyle\nUK onshore wind\n(House of Commons, 2006)\nUK offshore wind\n(from this paper)\nEU onshore wind\n(Krohn et al., 2009)\nEU offshore wind\n(Krohn et al., 2009)\n47\n69\n80\n104\nCO\nE:\n \n\u00a3\/\nM\nW\nh\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nFigure 7.

Therefore, despite a relative\nhigh capital cost at North Hoyle, the COE has been kept down to\napproximately \u00a367\/MWh, the same level as Scroby Sands and\nKentish Flats.\nFigure 9 shows the relative position of capital cost and capacity\nfactor for the different UK round 1 offshore wind farms. Barrow\nlocates in region 1 which represents its high capital cost and\nlow capacity factor and is attributable to the operational issues\nidentified above. This is reflected in its high COE at\napproximately \u00a386\/MWh. Kentish Flats and Scroby Sands locate\nin region 2 which represents their lower capital cost and\ncapacity factor. They both have great potential to reduce their\nCOE by improving their capacity factor. North Hoyle locates in\nregion 3 which represents high capital cost and capacity factor.\nAll three wind farms have COE at approximately \u00a367\/MWh.\nRegion 4 would be the best option for economic performance,\nrepresenting a low capital cost and a high capacity factor.\nKentish Flats and Scroby Sands have the opportunity to enter\nregion 4, while Barrow could enter region 3.\nFigure 10 shows the monthly capacity factor against availability\nfor four wind farms. Note that the bottom-left light-grey region\nshows a \u2018bad region\u2019 where monthly capacity factors are lower\nthan 35% and availability is less than 70% regardless of wind\nspeed. For availability more than 70%, the capacity factors\nachieved ranges from 10% up to 65%. This is attributed to wind\nspeed influencing the capacity factor. The upper-right region\nshows a \u2018good region\u2019 of monthly performance in which\navailability is greater than 80% and capacity factors are greater\nthan 20%.\nBarrow\nNorth Hoyle\nScroby Sands\nKentish Flats\nCa\npi\nta\nl c\nos\nt: \n\u00a3\/\nkW\n30\u00b70% 40\u00b70%\nCapacity factor: %\n20\u00b70%\n1000\n1200\n1400\n1 3\n2 4\nFigure 9.

Monthly capacity factor against availability for the offshore wind farms, each point representing 1 month\u2019s operational data\n10 Energy 163 Issue EN0 Early experiences with UK round 1 offshore wind farms Feng et al.\n5.5. Influence of wind speed on performance\nIt has been shown in Section 4.4 that capacity factor and capital\ncost are the driving factors for the economic performance of UK\noffshore wind farms. Despite a mean annual wind speed over\n9.15m\/s at Barrow, the wind farm\u2019s economic performance has\nnot been as strong as might be expected. Possibly this has been\nthe result of the pitch systems issues raised above and the data\nhere records only the first year of operation.\nFigure 11 shows that higher average wind speed usually brings\na higher monthly capacity factor, except at Barrow which\nfollows a non-linear trend. Wind speed does not affect the\nperformance at Barrow positively, instead the capacity factor\ngoes down as wind speed rises. For the same wind speed, the\ncapacity factor of North Hoyle can usually reach a higher value\nthan at other wind farms.\nFigure 12 to Figure 15 show the availability against wind speed\non a monthly basis for the four wind farms, in which the larger\ncircles represent higher capacity factors and vice versa. It can be\nseen that high capacity factors are all gathered around wind\nspeeds 7\u201314m\/s, in line with the result of capacity factor shown\nin Figure 11. The monthly wind speed range 7\u201314m\/s deliver\nthe majority of energy for UK round 1 offshore wind farms. For\nexample, the highest monthly capacity factor achieved at North\nHoyle in January 2007 was 62%, with a mean wind speed of\n13.7m\/s and an availability of 82.7%.\nThe availabilities of UK round 1 offshore wind farms tend to\ndecrease with increasing wind speed. These are illustrated by\nFigures 12\u201315, although some of the early problems reported\nabove may be a cause, however, this trend confirms that\nreported in much larger survey (Harman et al., 2008).

The gradient of the availability\ntrend line is apparently correlated with the capacity factor trend\nline shown in Figure 11. In other words, the smaller the gradient\nof the availability trend line against wind speeds, the better the\noperational performance of offshore wind farms. The decreasing\ntrends as shown above are much more severe than those can be\nestimated from worldwide onshore wind farms, as shown in\nFigure 16 (Harman et al., 2008). The 10-min average SCADA\ndata show the onshore availabilities vary only from 94.5% to\n97.5%, although they also tend to decrease at high wind speeds.\n6. DISCUSSION\nTwo government reports (House of Commons, 2006; DTI, 2006)\nestimated that the COE for UK offshore wind generation would\nbe \u00a355\u201390\/MWh (at discount rate 10%) and \u00a355\u201384\/MWh\nrespectively. Based on published reports from the \u2018Offshore wind\ncapital grants scheme\u2019 during the period 2004\u20137, the economic\nperformance of round 1 offshore wind farms with a COE of\n\u00a369\/MWh at discount rate 10% lies within those expectations,\ndespite the early operational difficulties reported above.\nThe annual average capacity factor of round 1 offshore wind\nfarms to date has been 29.5% and the annual average\navailability 80.2%. Onshore experience confirms that\navailability can improve after teething problems have been\nresolved in the first few years\u2019 operation (Harman et al., 2008).\nCan offshore availability also be improved with time? The\nanswer must be yes but the data period for \u2018Offshore wind\ncapital grants scheme\u2019 reports was limited to 3 years in the early\npart of operation, so future data will need to be studied to find a\ndefinitive answer.\nAlthough annual average availabilities were low the wind farms\nstill achieved an average capacity factor of 29.5%, greater than\nonshore UK wind farms with an average availability of 97%,\nbecause onshore wind speeds are lower than offshore. From this\npoint of view, UK offshore wind farms, with higher wind speeds,\nhave the potential to improve their capacity factors as can be\nseen from Figure 11. On the other hand, rich wind resources\npose new challenges for the operation of offshore wind farms.\nThe average availability achieved by these UK offshore wind\nfarms is only at the level of Danish onshore wind turbines in\nearly 1980s. This might be because for the wind farms reported\nthe wind turbines being used were originally designed for\nonshore rather than offshore use therefore may not have been\nsufficiently modified to meet the challenging offshore\nenvironment.\nThe results show that despite a good COE the reported UK\nround 1 offshore wind farms lost substantial annual energy\nproduction due to low availability, this is clear in Figure 3.\nThe early economic performance of the reported UK round 1\noffshore wind farms depends strongly on the availability. In\none case, Barrow, an offshore wind farm with good wind\nresource did not achieve strong economic performance during\nthe reporting period because of low availability, although\nthere were extenuating operational difficulties which will have\ncaused this.\nIf project capital costs increase, a strategy that may have to be\nadopted by some wind farm operators to improve offshore\neconomics, as appears to have been done at North Hoyle, is to\nencourage more proactive O&M, raising O&M costs but\nincreasing energy yield. This will mitigate high capital costs by\nimproving annual energy production.\nThe results also show that the availability of reported UK\noffshore wind farms tend to decrease at monthly wind speeds\n7\u201314m\/s while the majority of energy is delivered in this speed\nrange. For onshore wind farms, the causes of this availability\nSystem availabilty averaged over all wind farms\nCumulative % of energy delivered (annual mean wind speed = 8 m\/s)\nCumulative % of time (annual mean wind speed = 8 m\/s)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n90\n91\n92\n93\n94\n95\n96\n97\n98\n99\n100\n5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\nSy\nst\nem\n a\nva\nila\nbi\nlity\n: %\nCu\nm\nul\nat\nive\n fr\neq\nue\nnc\ny \nWind speed: m\/s\nFigure 16. Worldwide onshore availability against wind speed (Harman et al. 2008, courtesy of the original authors for assistance to\nreproduce the figure)\nEnergy 163 Issue EN0 Early experiences with UK round 1 offshore wind farms Feng et al. 13\nreduction could be severe climate issues causing systematic\nturbine faults due to excessive loads, which wind sector\nmanagers will try to minimise by operational management. For\nthe UK offshore wind farms, the early operational issues are\nlikely the causes of the availability reduction. Therefore, it is\nimportant to solve these operational problems and improve\navailability at wind speeds 7\u201314m\/s to raise the overall\neconomic performance.\nGiven poorer accessibility for maintenance offshore, it is\nessential to improve the intrinsic reliability of offshore wind\nturbines, needing close collaboration between turbine\nmanufacturers, wind farm operators and research institutes. To\nthis end, future research for wind energy in UK could be\n(a) to develop a generic methodology for reliability data\ncollection and analysis\n(b) to establish a reliability benchmark of wind turbine\nsubassemblies\n(c) to understand the failure modes and failure mechanisms of\ndifferent wind turbine subassemblies\n(d ) to develop a guideline for wind turbine manufacturers to\nconduct the reliability centred maintenance (RCM)\n(e) to develop an advanced health monitoring system for wind\nturbines\n( f ) to develop cost-effective condition monitoring methods for\nwind turbine.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\n(a) At an approximate cost of energy (COE) of \u00a369 per MWh\nduring the period 2004\u20137 the reporting UK round 1 offshore\nwind farms have an economic performance within the\nexpectations of the government reports prior to these\ninvestments, despite the early operational problems at these\nwind farms.\n(b) The annual average capacity factor for reporting UK round\n1 offshore wind farms during their early period of operation\nis 29.5%, greater than the current 27.3% average for\nonshore UK wind farms but less than that achieved by other\nEuropean established offshore wind farms.\n(c) The greatest cause of loss of energy for reporting UK round\n1 offshore wind farms is low technical or system\navailability. The annual average technical availability for\nreporting UK round 1 offshore wind farms is 80.2%, much\nless than the average availability of 97% achieved by\nonshore wind farms in UK or the availability at 93.3%\nachieved by an established EU offshore wind farm,\nMiddelgrunden. It is likely that these low availabilities are a\ndirect result of the early operational issues at these wind\nfarms.\n(d ) The annual average O&M cost as a percentage of COE for\nreporting UK round 1 offshore wind farms is 18% and the\nO&M cost is approximately \u00a312 per MWh. This percentage\ncompares well with the value of 12% O&M costs for\nonshore wind in the UK and this is much less than the\npremium for O&M costs for offshore wind predicted in the\nindustry.\n(e) A strategy that could be adopted by wind farm operators to\nimprove offshore economics would be to encourage more\nproactive O&M, raising O&M costs but increasing energy\nyield. This will mitigate high capital costs by improving\nannual energy production.\n( f ) The availability of reporting UK round 1 offshore wind\nfarms tends to decrease with increasing wind speed, though\nNorth Hoyle is an exception to this.\n(g) Improvements in the performance of these and other\noffshore wind farms should focus on improving the\navailability at wind speeds 7\u201314m\/s.\n(h) UK offshore wind farms have great potential to extract\nmore energy from the wind and achieve lower COEs, but\ntheir reliability and availability must be substantially\nimproved. This could be achieved through intensive R&D\nactivities by manufacturers and operators and a plan for\nsuch activities has been set out in the paper.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work has been funded by the EU FP7 Project RELIAWIND\n212966 with some assistance from the UK EPSRC Supergen\nWind Programme.
