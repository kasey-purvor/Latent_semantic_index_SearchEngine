Renate, Ailsa Craig and SS1 were characterised according to 10 \ntheir mineral content.  The concentrations of the macronutrients phosphorus, potassium, 11 \ncalcium, manganese and sulphur and the micronutrients iron, boron, manganese, copper 12 \nand zinc were analysed in freshly harvested and stored onion bulbs using ICP-AES 13 \n(Inductively coupled plasma \u2013 atomic emission spectroscopy).  Onions were treated pre-14 \nharvest with additional sulphur (100 kg ha-1) and\/or calcium (300 kg ha-1) applied in four 15 \ncombinations at the time of seed drilling, however these treatments did not affect the total 16 \nconcentrations of sulphur or calcium in the harvested bulbs.  The data were subjected to 17 \ncanonical variate analysis in order to determine the most appropriate variate to 18 \ndiscriminate between cultivars.  Two canonical variates were sufficient to differentiate 19 \nbetween the three cultivars, with the first canonical variate describing differences in 20 \nmicronutrients between the genotypes and the second separating the cultivars by 21 \ndifferences in sulphur concentration. 22 \n 23 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nKeywords:  Allium cepa; calcium; multivariate analysis; sulphur. 24 \n 25 \n1. Introduction 26 \n 27 \nThe elemental composition of the edible portion of some Allium species has been 28 \nused as a method for defining geographic origin (Ariyama, Horita, & Yasui, 2004; 29 \nAriyama & Yasui, 2006; Ariyama, Aoyama, Mochizuki, Homura, Kadokura, & Yasui, 30 \n2007).  In addition, analysis of 63 major and trace elements was shown to allow 31 \ndifferentiation between conventionally and organically grown onions cv. Hysam from 32 \nDenmark (Gundersen, Bechmann, Behrens, & St\u00fcrup, 2000).  However, apart from these 33 \nworks and others (Bibak et al., 1998; Alvarez, Marc\u00f3, Arroyo, Greaves, & Rivas, 2003; 34 \n(Rodr\u00edguez Galdon, Oropeza Gonz\u00e1lez, Rodr\u00edguez Rodr\u00edguez, & D\u00edaz Romero, 2008) 35 \nthere has been little research concerning the elemental composition of bulb onions.  Most 36 \nwork concerning manipulation of mineral nutrition of onions has concentrated on the 37 \neffect on quality parameters, particularly the effects on pungency (enzymatically 38 \nproduced pyruvate after maceration), flavour precursors and firmness.  Only a few studies 39 \nhave performed analysis to determine whether the changes in mineral nutrition resulted in 40 \nan effect on total mineral concentrations in the bulb.  Field, hydroponic and tissue culture 41 \ntrials worldwide have shown that attempting to manipulate the sulphur content of onions 42 \nby varying the sulphur supply during growth has had mixed results and is highly 43 \ndependent on a range of factors.  These factors include cultivar, the extent of variation of 44 \nsulphur supply, and other seasonal and environmental influences including climactic 45 \nconditions and soil type (Randle, 1992; Randle, Bussard, & Warnock, 1993; Hamilton, 46 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nYoo, & Pike, 1998; Kopsell, Randle, & Eiteman, 1999; Lancaster, Farrant, & Shaw, 47 \n2001; Coolong, Kopsell, Kopsell, & Randle, 2004; O'Donoghue et al., 2004).  In general, 48 \nincreasing the sulphur supply increases firmness, pungency, alk(en)yl cysteine 49 \nsulphoxides (ACSOs) and dry matter when the treatment is applied constantly (e.g. in a 50 \nhydroponic system), or when applied as a field treatment towards the end of the growing 51 \nseason when bulbing has been initiated.  The effect of the addition of calcium chloride to 52 \nthe crop has also been investigated in the USA (Coolong & Randle, 2008).  Additional 53 \ncalcium nutrition resulted in increased firmness of bulbs at harvest, although this effect 54 \ndid not persist throughout storage.  Reduced pyruvate concentration was observed in 55 \nCaCl2-treated onions, but this effect only occurred in one out of two growing seasons.  56 \nWork carried out on UK-grown onions was unable to replicate these results (B. Smith & 57 \nT. Crowther, pers. comm, 2005). 58 \nGiven previous findings, the aim of the research presented herein was to 59 \ndetermine the effects of field application of additional calcium and\/or sulphur treatments 60 \non the mineral content of onion bulbs grown from seed, and to describe genotypic 61 \ndifferences in the mineral content of onion bulbs of short, intermediate and long-storing 62 \nonion cultivars viz. SS1, Ailsa Craig and Renate respectively using canonical variate 63 \nanalysis.   64 \n 65 \n2. Experimental 66 \n 67 \n2.1 Plant material and storage regime 68 \n 69 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nShort, intermediate and long-storing onion (Allium cepa L.) cvs.; SS1, Ailsa Craig 70 \nand Renate, respectively, were spring-drilled on 18 March 2003 in four rows per bed 71 \nusing a tape seeder at a rate of 35 seeds m-2 and grown in a sandy loam soil field at FB 72 \nParrish & Son (Beds., UK) using standard agronomic practices.  Two treatments of 73 \nadditional sulphur and\/or calcium at rates of 100 kg ha-1 of sulphur and 300 kg ha-1 of 74 \ncalcium were applied in four combinations including a negative control (plus Ca minus S, 75 \nplus Ca and S, minus Ca plus S and minus Ca and S).  Sulphur, in the form of agricultural 76 \ngypsum, was applied uniformly over the plot area at the time of drilling.  Calcium was 77 \napplied evenly by hand in the form of 77% calcium chloride flakes (Kemira, Cheshire, 78 \nUK).  Onion bulbs were harvested (cv. SS1 on 19 August 2003; cvs. Renate and Ailsa 79 \nCraig on 2 September 2003) into standard 25 kg plastic nets and dried in bin driers with 80 \nambient air for five weeks (cv. SS1) and three weeks (cvs. Ailsa Craig and Renate) as per 81 \nstandard practice in the UK.  The dry aerial parts and roots were removed, and any 82 \ndiseased or damaged bulbs discarded prior to storage.  Bulbs were held under industry 83 \nstandard controlled atmosphere (CA) conditions (3 kPa CO2 and 5 kPa O2; Smittle, 1988) 84 \nusing an Oxystat 2 CA system, attached to an Oxystat 2002 Controller, and Type 770 85 \nfruit store analyser (David Bishop Instruments, Sussex, UK).  This system was self-86 \ncalibrating every 24 h against 5% CO2 in N2 (British Oxygen Co., Surrey, UK) as 87 \npreviously described by Chope, Terry & White (2007).  Bulbs were stored at 2 \u00b1 1\u00b0C 88 \ninside two rigid polypropylene fumigation chambers (88 x 59 x 59 cm).  Relative 89 \nhumidity was not measured.  90 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n91 \n2.2 Experimental design 92 \n 93 \nThe experiment was conducted as a completely randomised design with the 94 \nassumption that the storage containers were identical and the samples were taken 95 \nrandomly.  Bulbs were divided equally between the two storage containers.  Bulbs were 96 \nremoved from storage at regular intervals.  Samples of cv. Renate were taken after days 97 \n0, 40 and 230, cv. Ailsa Craig after days 0, 81 and 129, and cv. SS1 after days 0, 40 and 98 \n81.  At each sampling date (except time 0) for each cultivar, three bulbs from each 99 \ntreatment were sampled from each storage chamber.  At sampling time 0, four sets of six 100 \nbulbs were sampled.  Samples from each set of three bulbs from each sampling time and 101 \ntreatment were combined and lyophilised prior to mineral analysis (except at time 0 102 \nwhere sets of 6 bulbs were combined); therefore, values represent the mean of the 103 \nreplicates for each sampling date and cultivar.   104 \n 105 \n2.3 Sample preparation 106 \n 107 \nThe dry outer skins were removed, and then a vertical wedge of tissue was taken from 108 \nthe basal section of the bulb.  Each sample was weighed and immediately snap-frozen in 109 \nliquid nitrogen, and stored at -40\u00baC until it was lyophilised.  Dry weight measurements 110 \nwere made on lyophilised samples. 111 \n 112 \n2.4 Mineral analysis 113 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n114 \nLyophilised bulb tissue (n = 60) was ashed and then digested with 1 ml 115 \nconcentrated nitric acid (ADAS, 1985).  The intensity of ion response was measured by 116 \nICP-AES (Inductively coupled plasma \u2013 atomic emission spectroscopy; Ultima 2, Jobin 117 \nYvon, London, UK).  Results were expressed as total ion concentrations of boron, 118 \ncalcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, sulphur 119 \nand zinc by comparison with external standards.   120 \n 121 \n2.5 Statistical analysis 122 \n 123 \nThe effect of the application of additional calcium and sulphur to onion plants in 124 \nthe field on the concentration of each mineral analysed was assessed using ANOVA.  The 125 \ncalcium and sulphur treatments did not affect total bulb sulphur or calcium content at a 126 \nprobability level of 0.05.  Therefore, the data sets for all calcium and sulphur treatments 127 \nwere pooled. A main effect of cultivar was identified by univariate analysis of variance 128 \n(ANOVA).  The groups were further defined using canonical variate analysis (CVA) 129 \n(Gardner, Gower & Le Roux, 2006), which bases the analysis on grouping the data so 130 \nthat the variance between groups (cultivars) is maximized and the variance within groups 131 \nis minimised.   The circular 95% confidence limits represent the confidence interval for 132 \nthe population rather than the population mean and have radii of 2.448.  The basic radius 133 \nvalue is the square root of the chi-square distribution value at the 5% significance level, 134 \nfor a distribution with 2 degrees of freedom (as displaying the CVA in 2 dimensions).  135 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nAll statistical analyses were carried out using Genstat for Windows Version 7.1.0.198 136 \n(VSN International Ltd., Herts., UK).   137 \n 138 \n3. Results and discussion 139 \n 140 \nThe variation in mineral content between cultivars was greater than the variation 141 \ncaused by storage time (Fig. 1). Bulbs of each cultivar were stored for different lengths of 142 \ntime due to differences in storage life; however, the sampling points represent the 143 \nbeginning, middle and end of the storage period for each.   144 \n 145 \nINSERT FIGURE 1. 146 \n 147 \nTo enable comparison with other published data on the elemental composition of 148 \nonions, the data was calculated on a fresh weight basis using the mean dry weights of 149 \neach cultivar (Table 1).    150 \n 151 \nINSERT TABLE 1. 152 \n 153 \nFree mineral content should not be expected to change on a dry weight basis 154 \nduring storage yet mineral content will change as a proportion of fresh weight due to 155 \nweight loss.  Therefore, the different concentrations recorded at various storage durations 156 \nare more likely to represent the natural variation within the population rather than real 157 \nchanges in mineral concentration.  Onion cv. Ailsa Craig bulbs showed the greatest 158 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nvariability over time (Fig. 1), and this may be attributed to the fact that it is a not a 159 \ncommercial cultivar and maintenance of the breeding line is poor (B. Smith, pers. comm, 160 \n2004).  Previously published data (Hansen, Wyse, & Sorensen, 1979; Holland, Unwin, & 161 \nBuss, 1991; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2004) is comparable with that recorded in 162 \nthis investigation (Table 1); however, onion cv. Renate bulbs contained approximately 2-163 \nfold the concentration of calcium, copper, iron, potassium and sodium than the values 164 \ncited by the literature (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2004) for unspecified cultivars.  165 \nThe data are, however, within the same range as that reported for calcium, copper, iron, 166 \nmanganese, potassium and zinc in cvs. 438 Granex and Yellow Granex, using a technique 167 \nbased on total reflection X-ray fluorescence and ultrasound-based extraction procedure 168 \n(Alvarez et al.,  2003), and for those reported for boron, copper, manganese, potassium 169 \nand sodium in onion cv. Hysam measured using high resolution ICP-MS (Bibak et al., 170 \n1998).  In addition, the data reported here are similar to those reported for copper, iron, 171 \nmanganese and zinc in the fresh leaves of other Allium L. species (viz. A. schoenoprasum 172 \nL., A. nutans L., A. angulosum L., A. fistulosum L., A. montanum Schmidt, A. odorum L. 173 \nand A. flavescens Bess.) measured using ICP-MS (Golubev, Golubkina, & Gorbunov, 174 \n2003).  The reason for differences occurring between reported values for mineral 175 \nconcentrations in onion is likely to be due to a combination of factors including the 176 \npreharvest growing conditions, postharvest treatment, analytical methods, and, as has 177 \nbeen demonstrated here, genotype.       178 \nOnion cv. SS1 bulbs had a greater concentration of total sulphur per gram dry 179 \nweight than cv. Ailsa Craig and Renate (Fig. 1).  This is perhaps surprising as cv. SS1 180 \nwas the least pungent of the three cultivars (Chope, Terry, & White, 2006), and pungency 181 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nis determined by the availability of sulphur-containing flavour precursors (ACSOs).  182 \nPungency is calculated on a fresh weight basis to reflect the edible product.  However, all 183 \nmineral analyses were performed on lyophilised tissue, and when the concentrations were 184 \ncalculated on a fresh weight basis (using the mean dry weight percentage), free sulphur 185 \nconcentration was least in cv. SS1 bulbs (Table 1).  In addition, it has been shown that 186 \nthere are genotypic differences in the partitioning of sulphur accumulated by the onion 187 \nplant.  Randle, Kopsell, Kopsell, & Snyder (1999), showed that total bulb sulphur 188 \naccumulation was poorly correlated with pungency in three onion cultivars.  They 189 \nconcluded that a key contributing factor in determination of the pungency of an onion 190 \ndepends upon the capability of the plant to partition sulphur as sulphate in the vacuole, 191 \nthus reducing the amount of sulphur incorporate into the ACSO biosynthetic pathway.  192 \nAll elements measured (except for calcium) were present in significantly different 193 \n(P<0.005) concentrations in onion cvs. Renate, Ailsa Craig and SS1 bulbs (Fig. 1).  There 194 \nwas no consistent pattern according to which cultivar had the highest and lowest 195 \nconcentration of each element, although cv. Ailsa Craig did not have the highest 196 \nconcentration of any of the elements measured.  However, since ANOVA is a univariate 197 \ntechnique which allows comparisons to be made between cultivars based on a single 198 \nvariate it does not give an insight into how the cultivars are grouped or which is the most 199 \nimportant element in defining groups.  Canonical variate analysis (CVA) allows these 200 \ntypes of conclusions to be drawn, and has previously been used to discriminate between 201 \ncultivars of other crop species (Cole & Phelps, 1979).  Another type of multivariate 202 \nanalysis, principal component analysis (PCA) has been recently applied to data on 203 \nmineral and trace elements in onion bulbs of six different cultivars from various seed 204 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \norigins cultivated under the same agronomic, climactic and soil conditions (Rodr\u00edguez 205 \nGaldon et al., 2008).  Significant differences in mineral composition were reported 206 \nbetween cultivars, although relatively high genotypic overlap was evident.  207 \nGood separation of the cultivars was obtained using CVA.  The majority of the 208 \nvariation, 89.23 %, was explained by the first canonical variate (CV1), which separated 209 \nRenate from cvs. Alisa Craig and SS1, while 10.77 % of the variation was explained by 210 \nthe second canonical variate.  Onion cv. Renate bulbs differed from cvs. Ailsa Craig and 211 \nSS1, as shown by the high positive score for Renate in CV1 (5.901), versus negative 212 \nscores for Ailsa Craig (-2.702) and SS1 (-2.134), respectively.  Canonical variate 2 (CV2) 213 \ndiscriminated between cv. SS1 and cvs. Ailsa Craig and Renate, as shown by the positive 214 \nscore for SS1 for CV2 (1.536), versus negative scores for Ailsa Craig (-1.424) and Renate 215 \n(-0.118), respectively.  In the case of CV1 there was less variation between the cultivars 216 \nin terms of the macronutrients measured (viz. phosphorus, potassium, calcium, 217 \nmanganese and sulphur) than for the micronutrients measured (viz. iron, boron, 218 \nmanganese, copper and zinc), as demonstrated by the higher scores for CV1 for the 219 \nmacronutrients compared to the micronutrients (Table 2).  220 \n 221 \nINSERT TABLE 2. 222 \n      223 \nA plot of the means of the data relative to the first two canonical variates (Fig. 2) 224 \nshowed that there was minimal overlapping between the 95% confidence limits for each 225 \ncultivar.  The highest loading for CV1 was assigned to boron, and onions cv. Renate had 226 \na high positive value for CV1, signifying a high boron concentration compared to cvs. 227 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nAilsa Craig and SS1.  The highest loading for CV2 was assigned to sulphur, indicating 228 \nthat onion bulbs cv. SS1 contained a higher concentration of sulphur per dry weight than 229 \ncvs. Renate and Ailsa Craig, which was also demonstrated using ANOVA.  230 \n 231 \nINSERT FIGURE 2 232 \n 233 \nThe sulphur and calcium treatments, applied at the time of seed drilling, did not 234 \naffect bulb sulphur or calcium content.  Similarly, fertilisation with calcium (in the form 235 \nof calcium carbonate) or magnesium (in the form of magnesium sulphate) a few days 236 \nprior to planting did not affect the concentration of magnesium or calcium in onion cv. 237 \nSuper-Kitamomjii bulbs grown in Japan (Ariyama, Nishada, Noda, Kadokura, & Yasui, 238 \n2006).  Conversely, Coolong & Randle (2008) recently reported that application of 239 \ncalcium chloride to low pungency Vidalia cv. Georgia Boy onions increased bulb calcium 240 \nconcentration in each of two growing seasons.  The final rate of application was 115 and 241 \n230 kg ha-1, applied at 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks after transplant, ensuring a regular supply 242 \nthroughout the growing season.  It may be that this staggered approach to application was 243 \nthe reason why mineral content was affected.  It is also possible that the method of 244 \ncultivation i.e. the use of transplants rather than direct drilling could have affected the 245 \nresults.  However, sulphur concentration was only increased in one growing season 246 \nfollowing application of 155 or 230 kg ha-1 ammonium sulphate staggered at 6 and 10 247 \nweeks after transplant.  It is evident from the results presented herein that the sulphur and 248 \ncalcium applied was not present in the soil in a sufficiently available form, or was applied 249 \ntoo early to the crop.  There is also the possibility that the sulphur and calcium were taken 250 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nup early on in the growth period, and retained in the upper part of the plant, however, it 251 \nhas been shown that ACSOs are translocated from the leaves to the storage scales during 252 \nbulbing (Mallor & Thomas, 2008).  In addition, it may have been that the soil conditions 253 \nsupplied sufficient sulphur and calcium nutrition to plants so that the applied treatments 254 \ndid not have a measurable effect.   255 \n 256 \n4. Conclusion 257 \n 258 \nThe work presented herein has shown that it is possible to separate the three 259 \ncultivars in this experiment on the basis of mineral content using just two canonical 260 \nvariates.  It was also apparent that when onions of different cultivars are grown on the 261 \nsame site (i.e. same soil and climatic conditions), there are still significant differences in 262 \nthe mineral composition of the bulbs.  It is therefore likely that the source of this variation 263 \nis genotypic.  Additional calcium and sulphur fertilisation applied at the time of drilling 264 \nhad no significant effect on the concentrations of these minerals in the bulbs.  Therefore, 265 \nit is important to consider the mode and timing of application of these treatments, and it 266 \nshould not be assumed that mere application to the soil results in greater bioavailability.  267 \n 268 \nAcknowledgements 269 \n 270 \nThis work was performed as part of a project funded by the Horticultural 271 \nDevelopment Council; \u2018Understanding the mechanisms behind onion bulb dormancy in 272 \nrelation to the potential of improved onion storage\u2019 (CP20).
