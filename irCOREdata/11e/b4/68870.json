Introduction\nBilayer graphene [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9] is one of several graphite allotropes [10]\nthat display unique physical properties determined by the hexagonal symmetry\nof their two-dimensional crystalline structure. The electronic band structure\nof bilayer graphene close to the Fermi energy consists of two degenerate bands\ntouching each other at the charge neutrality point (the position of the Fermi\nenergy in a neutral system) and two bands split by the interlayer coupling [2, 4,\n5]. In bilayer-based field-effect transistors a band gap in the electronic structure\ncan be opened using a transverse electric field that breaks the symmetry between\nthe layers [4, 7, 8, 9], which may play an important role in forming the transport\ncharacteristics of such devices [6].\nIn this paper we analyze self-consistently the interlayer asymmetry parame-\nter for bilayer graphene field-effect transistors, using the tight-binding approxi-\nmation. The focus of this study is the manifestation of interlayer asymmetry in\nthe magnetospectroscopy of bilayers, and we perform a self-consistent analysis\nfor bilayer flakes subjected to quantizing magnetic fields, taking into account the\n\u2217Corresponding author\nEmail address: e.mccann1@lancaster.ac.uk (E.

When the ma-\nterial is kept at constant filling factor upon the variation of magnetic field (the\nmeasurement scheme employed in recent experiment [1]), the necessity to vary\nthe charge density on the layers causes significant asymmetry and the Landau\nlevel (LL) spectrum in a strong magnetic field is altered considerably. Our cal-\nculation generalizes the self-consistent analysis [7] developed for bilayers at zero\nmagnetic field, and the analysis presented here improves the rigour of Ref. [11]\nwhere the variation of interlayer asymmetry on density and its influence on\nLandau level transition energies was estimated by neglecting screening effects.\nAlso, we calculate magneto-optical spectra of bilayers in the infra-red spectral\nrange that has recently become accessible in optical experiments using cyclotron\nirradiation sources [12, 13, 14], and where transitions between degenerate and\nsplit bands of the bilayer may occur.\n2. The Landau level spectrum in charged bilayers: self-consistent\nanalysis\nA schematic view of bilayer graphene (marked with the hopping integrals\nconsidered throughout this paper) and the Brillouin zone of bilayer graphene\nare shown in Fig. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. Bilayer graphene consists of two\ncoupled hexagonal lattices with inequivalent sites A1, B1 and A2, B2 in the\nfirst and second graphene sheets, respectively, which are arranged according to\nBernal (A2-B1) stacking [2]. The hexagonal Brillouin zone has two inequiva-\nlent degeneracy points K\u03be = (\u03be\n4pi\n3a , 0) (where \u03be \u2208 {+,\u2212} and a is the lattice\nconstant). Here, we take into account only the nearest-neighbour in-plane and\ninterlayer (A2-B1) coupling and the lowest-order terms in the electron band\nenergy expansion in electron momentum (determined as the deviation of the\nelectron wave number from the corner K+ or K\u2212 of the hexagonal Brillouin\nzone that is identified below as the centre of the valley), which corresponds to\n2\nthe Hamiltonian:\nH\u02c6=\u03be\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u2212u2 0 0 vpi\u2020\n0 u2 vpi 0\n0 vpi\u2020 u2 \u03be\u03b31\nvpi 0 \u03be\u03b31 \u2212u2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 .

The LL spectrum can be obtained from\nthe Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) using the Landau gauge A = (0,\u2212Bx) and the fact\nthat operators pi = px+ipy\u2212eBx and pi\u2020 = px\u2212ipy+eBx coincide with lowering\n(raising) operators in the basis of Landau functions \u03c8m(x, y) = e\niqyy\/~\u03c6m(x +\nqy\u03bb\n2\nB) (where \u03c6m(x) are the wave functions of a quantum harmonic oscillator),\npi\u03c8m = \u2212i ~\n\u03bbB\n\u221a\n2m\u03c8m\u22121, pi\u03c80 = 0, and pi\u2020\u03c8m = i\n~\n\u03bbB\n\u221a\n2(m+ 1)\u03c8m+1, (2)\nwhere \u03bbB =\n\u221a\n~\/eB stands for magnetic length.\nFor a symmetric bilayer, u = 0, energies \u000fm of the Landau levels are described\nby [2, 15, 16, 17, 18]:\n\u000f0 = 0;\n\u000f\nc(s)\nm\u03b2 =\n\u03b2\u221a\n2\n(\n\u03b321 + \u0393(2m\u2212 1)\u00b1\n\u221a\n\u03b341 + 2\u0393\u03b3\n2\n1(2m\u2212 1) + \u03932\n) 1\n2\n,m \u2265 1;(3)\nwhere \u0393 = 2~\n2v2\n\u03bb2\nB\nand \u03b2 denotes conduction band (+) and valence band (\u2212) LLs.\nIndices c and s stand for low and high-energy (split) bands and correspond to\nminus and plus signs in front of the square root, respectively.\nNonzero asymmetry u, caused by a possible difference in electric potential\nenergy between the layers, modifies the LL spectrum [2, 19, 20, 21, 22]. To\nmodel this effect, we employ a self-consistent theory of the charging of bilayer\ngraphene. In order to reproduce the conditions of recent experiments [1] where\nthe transition energy between low-energy LLs was measured as a function of\na varying magnetic field but for a fixed filling factor, \u03bd, we extend the self-\nconsistent analysis of Ref. [7] from the zero-magnetic field regime into the\nregime of quantizing magnetic fields, taking into account the possibility that\nthere is finite asymmetry in a neutral structure [see Eq. (4) below]. The analysis\npresented here improves the rigour of Ref. [11] where the variation of interlayer\nasymmetry on density and its influence on Landau level transition energies was\nestimated by neglecting screening effects.\nIn particular, we consider a gated bilayer with interlayer separation c0. In\nexternal magnetic field B, a total excess density, n = \u03bd eBh , must be induced\n3\nusing the gate in order to keep the filling factor \u03bd fixed while changing B. The\ndensity n is shared between the two layers: n = n1 + n2 where n1 (n2) is the\nexcess density on the layer closest to (furthest from) the gate. The difference in\nelectric potential between the layers is related to an incomplete screening of the\ngate electric field by the charge en1 on the first layer alone and can be related\nto the unscreened density n2,\nu(\u03bd,B) = w +\ne2c0n2(\u03bd,B)\n\u000f0\u000fr\n. (4)\nHere \u000fr is the effective dielectric constant determined by the SiO2 substrate,\nand w takes into account finite asymmetry of a neutral structure (internal elec-\ntric field due to, for example, initial non-intentional doping of the flake by\ndeposits\/adsorbates). In our numerical calculations we use \u000fr = 2.\nOn the one hand, u influences the LL spectrum via the Hamiltonian in\nEq. (1). On the other hand, its value depends on the charge density n2 which\ncan only be obtained with a full knowledge of the LL spectrum and the wave\nfunctions corresponding to each LL. Therefore, a calculation of u requires a\nself-consistent numerical analysis. This calculation consists of the following\nsteps: for each given B, 5 < B < 20T, and \u03bd we choose a starting u, and\ndiagonalize Hamiltonian Eq. (1) to find the LL spectrum and the eigenstates\nwith m . Mmax where Mmax \u223c 300. Then, we sum over all filled Landau\nlevels and determine the excess electron densities on each layer. Note that,\nas a nonzero value of u splits the valley degeneracy of the LLs [22], care has\nto be taken when comparing densities in specific LLs in biased and neutral\nstructures, not to confuse levels in different valleys. Finally, using Eq. (4)\nwe find the asymmetry parameter and, then, iterate the numerical procedure\nto obtain the self-consistent value of u [23]. Note that, for a sufficiently large\ncutoff Mmax \u223c 300, the results were independent of Mmax.\nThe self-consistently calculated values of u obtained for several values of\nthe filling factor \u03bd are shown in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) for the case of w = 0\nand a nominal w = \u2212100meV, respectively. In the case when w = 0, the\ninduced interlayer asymmetry is antisymmetric with respect to the change of\nthe filling factor from positive to negative. This is because changing the filling\nfactor from +\u03bd to \u2212\u03bd corresponds to reversing the applied electric field and\ninducing excess densities \u2212n,\u2212n1 and \u2212n2 and thus reversing the sign of u.\nAlso, with decreasing B all curves tend towards u = 0 and u \u2248 \u221260meV in Fig.\n2(a) and 2(b), respectively. These values are the results of the self-consistent\ncalculation with corresponding values of w in the absence of a magnetic field [7].\nExamples of the low-energy LL spectrum for \u03bd = +4, w = 0 and for \u03bd = +12,\nw = \u2212100meV are shown in Fig. 2(c) and 2(d). To list the LLs in Fig. 2, we use\nthree symbols: sm\u03be, where s attributes the LL to the conduction (+) or valence\n(-) band, m is the LL index and \u03be \u2208 (+,\u2212) identifies the valley (K+ or K\u2212) that\nthe level belongs to, respectively. The Landau levels m = 0, 1 have no s index,\nas those levels are degenerate when u = 0 [2, 22]. The sign of the valley splitting\nof the level sm depends on the sign of u: for u > 0, level sm+ has higher energy\nthan level sm\u2212 whereas the opposite is true for u < 0.

The solid black lines show the contribution of both valleys to\nthe transition energy, calculated according to Eq. (5) (in this case the transition energy is the\nsame for both positive and negative \u03bd), whereas solid grey lines depict the transition energy\nin a neutral (u = 0) structure. Note that for \u03bd = 8, 12, 16 all black lines are very close to each\nother and difficult to resolve.\ninfrared light of energy ~\u03c9 was incident on the graphene bilayer in a strong\nexternal magnetic field and with a constant filling factor in order to excite charge\ncarriers between a prescribed pair of LLs and to probe the energy dispersion.\nAccording to the selection rules determined in Ref. [15] (and later extended for\nu 6= 0 [22]), only transitions which change the LL index m by one are allowed.\nAlso, as photons provide a very small momentum transfer, we only consider\ntransitions between levels at the same K point. Thus, the corresponding low-\nenergy transitions for filling factors \u03bd = +4,+8,+12,+16 are 1\u03be \u2192 +2\u03be, +2\u03be \u2192\n+3\u03be, +3\u03be \u2192 +4\u03be, +4\u03be \u2192 +5\u03be and for \u03bd = \u22124,\u22128,\u221212,\u221216 they are \u22122\u03be \u2192 1\u03be,\n\u22123\u03be \u2192 \u22122\u03be, \u22124\u03be \u2192 \u22123\u03be, \u22125\u03be \u2192 \u22124\u03be, respectively.

The results obtained for sets of parameters as in Fig. 2(a)\nand (b) are shown in Fig. 3 (w = 0) and Fig. 4 (w = \u2212100meV). We shall first\ndiscuss the case w = 0 presented in Fig. 3. In this case, for a specified value of B,\nthe asymmetry u changes sign with a change of the sign of the filling factor [Fig.\n2(a)], the Landau level spectrum for \u03bd and \u2212\u03bd are the same but the K points\nhave to be exchanged. Therefore, \u000f\u03bdtrans(K+) = \u000f\n\u2212\u03bd\ntrans(K\u2212), clearly seen in all\nfour graphs. Moreover, both transitions have the same intensity and contribute\nequally to \u000f\u03bdtrans (black solid line). Comparison with the transition energy for\na neutral bilayer (grey line) shows that non-zero u decreases the energy of the\ntransition. The greater |u| and B, the bigger the difference between excitation\n7\nenergy in symmetric and biased bilayers. However, this difference decreases with\nan increase of filling factor.\nIntroduction of parameter w breaks symmetry between the conduction and\nvalence band LLs as presented in Fig. 4 for the case of w = \u2212100meV. The\nvalence band excitation has greater energy than the conduction band excitation\nat filling factor \u03bd = \u00b14. However, this situation is reversed for higher filling\nfactors \u03bd = \u00b18,\u00b112,\u00b116 (this reversal was not observed in the experiment\n[1]). For this specific case, w = \u2212100meV, the asymmetry introduced between\nexcitations for filling factors \u03bd and \u2212\u03bd is of the size of 3 \u2212 10meV. These two\neffects, the reduction of the transition energy with the increase of u and the\nbreaking of the symmetry between transitions for positive and negative filling\nfactor caused by w, partly account for the disagreement between experimental\nfindings and Eq. (3) obtained from a tight-binding model for neutral bilayers as\nused in Ref. [1] to fit the data. Other investigations [24, 25] show that additional\ncorrections may arise from electron-electron interactions.\n4. IR magneto-optics in bilayer graphene\nIn this section, we analyse the optical transition spectra corresponding to\ntransitions between LLs in split bands of the bilayers. Here, we use the self-\nconsistently calculated interlayer-asymmetry parameter u, and the LL energies\nand wave functions, and we compute the infrared optical absorption spectra\n[15, 26] of right (\u2295) and left-handed (\t) circularly polarized light E\u03c9 = E\u03c9l\u2295\/\t,\nwith l\u2295 = (lx\u2212 ily)\/\n\u221a\n2 and l\t = (lx+ ily)\/\n\u221a\n2 for bilayer graphene in a strong\nexternal magnetic field. The broadening of the Landau levels is modeled using\na Lorentzian shape with the same full width at half maximum \u03b3 = 60meV for\nall Landau levels. Numerical results for magnetic field B = 14T and filling\nfactors \u03bd = 8 and \u03bd = 16 are shown in Fig. 5. For the case of w = 0, the\nsymmetry of the system demands that the intensity of absorption of light with\na given polarisation for filling factor \u03bd and at the K\u03be point is the same as that\nof the light with the inverted polarisation at the K\u2212\u03be point for filling factor \u2212\u03bd.\nThis, indeed, is the case for graphs in the left column of Fig. 5, where black\nsolid and dashed lines show absorption of right-handed (left-handed) and left-\nhanded (right-handed) circularly polarised light for the positive (negative) filling\nfactor, respectively. Such a symmetry is broken for the case of w = \u2212100meV,\nfor which the spectra for positive and negative filling factors are shown in the\nseparate panels, where solid and dashed lines refer to right-handed and left-\nhanded polarisation, respectively. In particular, the peak visible for some of the\nspectra at the radiation energy around 0.4eV corresponds to electron excitation\nbetween the low-energy m = 0 LL and one of the two high-energy m = 1 LLs.\nIts position can be used to determine the value of the coupling constant \u03b31, and a\nsmall shift in energy of this peak is due to strong magnetic field and asymmetry\nu. Presented curves show a similar shape as those predicted theoretically [15, 26]\nand observed experimentally [12, 13] for IR optical absorption in the biased\nbilayer.\n8\nn  =  8\nw  =  0\ni n\nt e\nn\ns i\nt y\n [\na .\nu\n. ]\n0 0 . 40 . 2 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 00 . 1 0 . 3 0 . 5 0 . 7 0 . 9 1 . 1\nh w  [ e V ]\ni n\nt e\nn\ns i\nt y\n [\na .\nu\n. ]\n0 0 . 40 . 2 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 00 . 1 0 . 3 0 . 5 0 . 7 0 . 9 1 . 1\nh w  [ e V ]\nn  =  - 1 6\nw  =  - 1 0 0 m e V\ni n\nt e\nn\ns i\nt y\n [\na .\nu\n. ]\n0 0 . 40 . 2 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 00 . 1 0 . 3 0 . 5 0 . 7 0 . 9 1 . 1\nh w  [ e V ]\nn  =  1 6\nw  =  0\ni n\nt e\nn\ns i\nt y\n [\na .\nu\n. ]\n0 0 . 40 . 2 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 00 . 1 0 . 3 0 . 5 0 . 7 0 . 9 1 . 1\nh w  [ e V ]\nn  =  + 8\nw  =  - 1 0 0 m e V\ni n\nt e\nn\ns i\nt y\n [\na .\nu\n. ]\n0 0 . 40 . 2 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 00 . 1 0 . 3 0 . 5 0 . 7 0 . 9 1 . 1\nh w  [ e V ]\nn  =  + 1 6\nw  =  - 1 0 0 m e V\ni n\nt e\nn\ns i\nt y\n [\na .\nu\n. ]\n0 0 . 40 . 2 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 00 . 1 0 . 3 0 . 5 0 . 7 0 . 9 1 . 1\nh w  [ e V ]\nn  =  - 8\nw  =  - 1 0 0 m e V\nFigure 5: Magneto-optical absorption spectra for bilayer graphene in strong external magnetic\nfield B = 14T and for filling factors \u03bd = 8 and \u03bd = 16 (left and right columns, respectively) and\nthe case of w = 0 (top row) and w = \u2212100meV (middle and bottom row).

Summary\nIn this work, we have considered gated bilayer graphene in external magnetic\nfield. We have shown that keeping the filling factor constant results in a break-\ning of the symmetry between the graphene layers due to the induced carrier\ndensity. We have calculated the interlayer asymmetry u self-consistently and\ndemonstrated its influence on the Landau level spectrum. Using these results,\nwe discussed both low-energy and high-energy inter-LL excitations and com-\npared them to recent experiments concerning optical absorption. In particular,\nwe achieved some improvement over the standard tight-binding model for neu-\ntral bilayer in the explanation of the cyclotron resonance experiment probing\nlow-energy the Landau level spectrum.\n9\n6.
