It shows the moment of the image's origin \nthat is always in the past to the moment in which it is viewed. Even the instantaneity \nof the polaroid photograph captures a scene or event that can have transformed \nbeyond recognition before the image is developed. However contrived, however still \nthe scene, a photograph offers us a glimpse of actions and events that have already \noccurred and which, usually, are finished. The photographic image, unlike the filmic \nimage, does not easily show the passage of time but it does show us that time has \npassed.2 Indeed, the limitation of the still photograph as a reflection of our world is \nthat it is always a freezing of a moment in the past. But its power is in reflecting that \nmoment from the real past rather than drawing us into the different present of a \ndiegesis3, of the unfolding narrative flow of events that we find in any kind of \nperformance in film or theatre. What photographs do is to bring the past into the \npresent, confronting us with the passage of time and the stillness of that which has \ngone. \nThe cultural critics Walter Benjamin and Roland Barthes were both fascinated by \nphotography, not as photographers or through any technical interest, but because of \nthe potency of the photographic image. Both also wrote about a range of other \ncultural media - texts, theatre, advertising, painting, film, toys - and both were \nintensely aware of the historicity of culture. Their perspective on history was \nsomewhat different, as we shall explore in this paper, but both address photography \nas a means of communication that emerged from the margins of culture at the end of \nthe last century to move rapidly to transform the character of artistic representation \nand human perception. For both, the representational possibilities and mass \nproliferation of photographic images become key features of modern culture.  \nBenjamin's enigmatic 1931 essay 'A Small History of Photography' (1985a: 240-257 - \nhereafter cited as SHP) traces the history of the production of photographic images \nand reflects upon their cultural impact. It brings together some ideas that had been \ngathered as part of his Arcades Project4 and that crop up in a number of his other \nwritings.5 As he comments on the evolving relationship between photography and the \nspheres of science, art, business and history, his analytical focus is upon the \nquestion of how the photograph communicates; how does it speak to those who view \nit? The photograph offers a model of Benjamin's own work on the city culture of \nmodernity that Gilloch (1996: 169) identifies as \"physiognomical\"; it attends to the \nsurface of the world, reproducing minutae and encouraging detailed scrutiny, \n 4 \nprovoking its viewer to engage with the complexity that is apparent beneath the \nsudden illumination of the image.  \nBarthes\u2019s early writing on photography also responded to the compulsion to read \nimages circulating in the culture. His interest was not primarly in the photography but \nhow images communicate within a cultural space.6 For Barthes, the photograph is \nable to present us with the social and material world through its power to convince us \nthat, whatever else the image evokes, there is a simple correspondence to a reality in \nthe past, \"an awareness of its having-been-there\" (Barthes 1977c: 44). In his 1980 \nessay Camera Lucida (1993 - hereafter cited as CL), Barthes disconnects the \nphotographic image from its context by addressing the images in a more direct way. \nAs he develops a conceptual vocabulary to make sense of his responses, it becomes \nclear that they can only really be understood in relation to history; specifically his own \nbiography and that of the people in the images. In Camera Lucida the theme of \nhistorical moments that declare \u201cthat-has-been\u201d (\u00e7a-a-\u00e9t\u00e9 - CL: 115) returns as the \ncompelling feature of the photographs Barthes considers. \nThere is a considerable secondary literature on Benjamin's and Barthes's comments \non photography (including Price 1994; Cadaver 1997 and a number of interesting \ncontributions to Rabat\u00e9 1997) some of which discusses them both. Rather than \nreview this secondary literature in this paper we aim to bring a new dimension to the \ndiscussion, firstly by drawing out the importance of history to the way they approach \nphotographs and secondly by comparing them directly. Benjamin and Barthes are \nboth very much in the past of cultural studies, as are the photographs they study. But \nas time passes, their unique perspective on the emergence of new cultural forms \nsuch as photography still has much to tell us about what has become so prevalent \nand common place in contemporary culture. They do not explore the variability of the \naudience and so do not give gendered readings or expose the limitations of the 'male \ngaze' (Mulvey 1989), but what they do is to try to understand how photographs work \nas pictures of the past. \nThe photograph as a moment of history \nNeither Benjamin nor Barthes come up with a definitive analysis of the cultural role of \nphotography but they give us glimpses its extraordinary power to capture a number \nof aspects of the social world. What we wish to argue in this paper is that both \nBenjamin and Barthes find in photography a medium that allows them to explore \nideas of history central to the cultural critique that they engaged in. Both were \nentranced by the enigma of the photograph bringing back the past in a routine and \n 5 \nrepeatable way, accessible to almost anyone with eyes to see. The object of the \nphotograph does not stand for its function and then for its culture as an ancient tool \nor artefact found by an archaeologist does. It does not require linguistic \nunderstanding or translation as any textual document does. The historic force of a \nphotograph is in the way it mediates a world gone by, graspable at first glance as if \nthrough a window directly onto the past requiring nothing to be added by the art of a \nproducer or interpreter. \nThe most obvious way of treating the photograph is as a document of reality, one that \naccurately captures the physical presence of people, buildings, objects and nature. \nThe scene we glimpse with our eyes fades in memory, some aspects of it remaining \nlonger than others, but the view caught in the photographic image is complete and \nenduring. This is the powerful distanciation in time that the photograph affords. \nMemory is at best incomplete and unreliable but even the earliest photographs, \nincluding Niepce's 1826, 'View from a Window at Gras' and many daguerreotypes \nfrom the first half of the 19th century, are still available for scrutiny and reproduction. \nOne small movement of a finger can freeze time, making it available for later viewing, \nperhaps for infinity.  \nFor Benjamin this property of capturing time helps shape modernity: \nOf the countless movements of switching, inserting, pressing and the \nlike, the 'snapping' of the photographer has had the greatest \nconsequences. A touch of the finger now sufficed to fix an event for an \nunlimited period of time. The camera gave the moment a posthumous \nshock, as it were. \n(Benjamin 1992a [1939]: 171)   \nBarthes\u2019s response to the shock capacity of the photograph is the inverse; the \nmoment may be shocked into the future, but in the future it will fail to shock us.  \nCommenting on an exhibition of 'Shock-Photos' which include apparently shocking \nimages -  for example, of a crowd of soldiers beside a field of skulls - he comments \nthat:  \n\u2026none of the photographs\u2026touches us\u2026 because, as we  look at them, \nwe are in each case dispossessed of our judgement: someone has \nshuddered for us, reflected for us, judged for us\u2026.. for us they have no \nhistory \u2026 \n(Barthes 1979: 71-71) \n 6 \nThe taking and display of the photographic image achieves a moral judgement, more \nevidenced and less equivocal than could be sustained before the technological \nmodernity ushered in by photography. \nBoth of these elliptical commentators on culture are interested in how photography \nbrings a new dimension to history and historicity. For Benjamin the photograph has a \npotential to open up history, allowing us to see the past, to see something of what the \n'Angelus Novus' is staring at, as he is blown backwards into the future. As he says in \nhis Theses on the Philosophy of History: \"The true picture of the past flits by. The \npast can be seized only as an image which flashes up at the instant when it can be \nrecognised and is never seen again\" (Benjamin 1979b: 247) - this he calls the \n'dialectical image'. But the photograph offers an image of the past that has been \narrested so that it can be seen again and again - Benjamin calls this 'dialectics at a \nstandstill'.7 The metaphor of the 'dialectical image' as a point at which the present \nand the past meet is characteristic of Benjamin's method of understanding culture as \nhistory: \n\u2026 image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with \nthe now to form a constellation. In other words, image is dialectics at a \nstandstill. For while the relation of the present to the past is a purely \ntemporal, continuous one, the relation of what-has-been to the now is \ndialectical: is not progression but image, suddenly emergent. - Only \ndialectical images are genuine images\u2026 \n(Benjamin 1999: 462) \nThe dialectical image has to be read; it does not speak for itself and its purely \ntemporal link to the past must be turned into language which brings the image into \nthe present. This is the work of the critic who unravels the dialectic. History for \nBenjamin serves a more important purpose than simply gathering evidence to \nestablish order, sequence and cause because it is through reflection on the past that \nwe can engage with a process of redemption that may lead to happiness. Through \nsharing these reflections with others - and this is the point of writing - the critic can \ncontribute towards the collective redemption of humanity. The work of history is to \ngather and connect the fullness of human experience, to recognise details that at the \ntime seemed minor or trivial. This is not a disinterested activity and Benjamin refers \nto the edge that historical materialism gives to engaging critically with the past; \npresent danger leads to a new way of seeing past events and each generation that \nreflects must resist the tendency of the ruling class towards conformism. Of course \nfor Benjamin the threat was Fascism and the conformism to be resisted was the \n 7 \nbelief in technological progress. The past can only be understood through the lens of \nthe present but then the present cannot be comprehended without remembering the \npast. Benjamin uses the properties of the camera as a metaphor for the way that the \npast asserts its orderliness on the unfolding of history: \"The initial day of a calendar \nserves as a historical time-lapse camera\" (Benjamin 1992b: 253). As Konersmann \nputs it \"The metaphor of the photographic snapshot encapsulates and illustrates \nseveral of those attributes which characterise the conditions and modes of this \nhistoriography\u2026.\" (1991: 73-4).  \nBarthes similarly rejects the modern view of history as a sequence of causally \nconnected events, objectively representing reality, and argues that \"\u2026 historical \ndiscourse does not follow reality, it only signifies it; it asserts at every moment: this \nhappened, but the meaning conveyed is only that someone is making that assertion\" \n(Barthes 1970: 154). But unlike Benjamin, Barthes's approach to history pays more \nattention to the lifespan and experience of people rather than the dur\u00e9e of epochs. \nHe is suspicious of the capacity of the photograph to reveal the past to us but \nexplores how we engage with it through some form of recognition. It is only through \nthe use of judgement, of some identification with the past in the image, that it truly \nspeaks to us - but the image cannot achieve this on its own. His history of Michelet \n(Barthes 1987) includes all the images of the great historian that he could find - \ndrawings, paintings, lithographs and photographs. But, it is only the conjunction of \nelements - images, bibilographic details, the historical facts, the testimonies and the \nquotations - which evokes the emotional tone of Michelet and his reactions to the \nworld. The photographic images fix the corporeal man at chronological moments; \nthey situate him in the history, subject him to the historical processes on which he \nhimself is a master commentator. The photograph is a device Barthes uses to turn \nthe light of history on the consumate historiographer. He later turns the device on \nhimself in Barthes on Barthes (1977a), where he presents a series of photographs \nof his family and of himself along with biographical snippets prior to presenting a \nseries of paragraphs on his ideas.  \nBarthes's provocative account of Michelet incorporates the man and his human \nfrailties into the themes of his writing. This serves not to correct, modify or even \ninterpret Michelet, but situates him and his work by writing a new history which is of \nhistory and historians. While there is no aspiration to redemption in Barthes, there is \nsomething of Benjamin's concern with incorporating the past into the present in the \nway he uses Michelet's device of exploiting the tension between constructing a \n'narrative' and constructing a 'tableau' (Barthes 1987: 22-23). The writing proceeds to \n 8 \ntell a story but will stop and build a complex scene, a moment in the past which is \nrepresented in all its detail \"a second level of history, this one entirely panoramic\" \n(Barthes 1987: 23). For Barthes this is primarily a task of writing, of using metaphor, \nof juxtaposition of details. But the photograph, which displaced the panorama,8 \nprovides a scene as opposed to a narrative, a scene that is always from the past and \nthat has to be read like a tableau or a panorama, with the gaze moving across the \nplane of view in different directions, back and forward. \nRepresentation \nBenjamin's essay on photography (SHP) charts the evolving cultural impact of \nphotography as a representational form. Rather than debate whether photography is \nan art form, his 'small history' is an account of the successive phases through which \nphotography distinguishes itself from other forms of depiction: as an instrument of \nscience; displacing portrait and landscape painting; and finally as the precise, \nunadulterated representation of the physical and social environment. Benjamin\u2019s \naccount is not a precise chronological or a technological history but a reflection on \nthe impact of the cultural innovation of photography. \nThe photograph can serve as a documentary device, a tool of history or science, \nbecause of its technological capacity to render minute detail and to \u201creveal the \nsecret\u201d of what is captured in front of the lens (SHP: 243). Benjamin terms the 'optical \nunconscious' that which the eye must have seen but which the conscious brain \ncannot discern or grasp due to size, motion, or inconspicuousness.9 The camera \nrecords and freezes, enabling us to see what the human optical system cannot \ndistinguish or abstract from its surroundings or the flow of movement. It is, Benjamin \nnotes, able to capture, for example, what happens when \"a person steps out\" (SHP: \n243), what the sculptor Rodin described as \"the bizarre look of a man suddenly \nstruck with paralysis\" (cited in Virilio 1994: 2). While the painter or sculptor makes a \nseries of skilful and painstaking actions to construct an image that represents the \nillusion of motion and life, the photographer in no time and with hardly any effort, \nfaithfully and directly records each minute, frozen movement of the subject. The \noptical unconscious is captured not simply because of the short duration of the \nphotographic process (even in its earliest examples), but also because of its capacity \nto record exhaustively. Foreground and background, important and trivial, formal \npose and accidental gesture, intended smile and unintended grimace, the \nphotograph presents each detail without discrimination. Moreover, through \nenlargement, that which is undetected by the ordinary gaze may be perceived and \n 9 \nexplored. The photograph is thus not only immediate but also meticulous and \ncomplete.  \nThe spark of contingency \nFor Benjamin, the photographer captures and attests to a particular momentary \npresence, full yet ephemeral, coaxing the subject to give up something of their own \nlife to the photographic image. Early photography, even though used for experiment, \nrecording or as a technical aid to painting rather than as a medium of communication \nin itself, often evoked a sense of presence in the viewer that was different from other \nforms of representation. When Benjamin writes of David Octavius Hill's  photographic \nportrait of Mrs Elizabeth Hall, the \"Newhaven fishwife\" (c. 1843-1847), he refers to \nthe \"magical value\" of the photograph which resides not so much in the intentions of \nthe photographer, however talented, but rather in the subject herself, who \"even now \nis still real\" (SHP: 242-243). Indeed, the reader of the photograph is attracted to \nprecisely those fragmentary and contingent irruptions which escape and confound \nthe photographer's purpose. Benjamin writes: \nNo matter how artful the photographer, no matter how carefully posed \nhis subject, the beholder feels an irresistible urge to search such a \npicture for the tiny spark of contingency, of the Here and Now, with \nwhich reality has so to speak seared the subject, to find the \ninconspicuous spot where in the immediacy of that long-forgotten \nmoment the future subsists so eloquently that we looking back may \nrediscover it. (SHP: 243) \nThe \"spark of contingency\", marks the image as one that emanated only from a \nspecific time and place, testifying to the reality of a scene as a picture of the past.10 \nPhotography has the capacity to retain the unique and authentic presence of the \nsubject whose aura of humanity we perceive as the \"light struggles out of darkness\" \n(SHP: 248), from the gloom that enshrouded the earliest photographs. The spark of \ncontingency lies in the technology of early photography, which captured the \u201cfullness \nand security\u201d of a subject\u2019s gaze (SHP: 247) because of the lack of artifice in the \nphotographer's techniques and the investment of time by the sitter who \"grew into the \npicture\" (SHP: 245). The auratic quality he describes incorporates the presence of the \nbourgeois subject; posture, fashions and accessories, economic security and the \nparadoxical 'permanence' of those who are no more but whose traces remain (SHP: \n245). \n 10 \nThere is a deep ambivalence in Benjamin's response to aura in the photograph which \nis reflected in the ambiguity of the term. Aura is the then-and-there seen from the \nhere-and-now, a \"... strange weave of space and time: the unique appearance or \nsemblance of distance no matter how close the object may be\" (SHP: 250). The \nauratic object is at once something unique, something with the authority of \nauthenticity and something which carries a \u201ctestimony to the history it has \nexperienced\u201d (Benjamin 1992: 215). The viewer recognises something real and alive, \nsomething emanating from the image that can touch them; \"To perceive the aura of \nan object we look at means to invest it with the ability to look at us in return\" \n(Benjamin 1983a: 148). But photography as a mechanical means of reproduction \nbreaks the spell of aura, disenchants the image. The technology which offers multiple \ncopies, which can reveal the optical unconscious and which can \u201cmeet the beholder \nhalfway\u201d (Benjamin 1992c: 214) by leaving the exhibition and coming into the \nreader\u2019s home, begins to eradicate aura. As the object reaches closer to the masses, \nits uniqueness, its specificity in time and space and its authority decay. Benjamin \ndescribes how as photography came to supplant landscape and portrait painting, \nespecially the miniature, the craft skills of artists who had abandoned the brush for \nthe camera were soon displaced as \"businessmen invaded professional photography \nfrom every side\" precipitating \"a sharp decline in taste\" (SHP: 246). They produced \nabsurdly dressed and posed, sentimental pictures commissioned for the family album \nbut the haunting presence, the mark of aura, that had been lost through such banal \nand tasteless theatricality could not be restored through the new techniques of \nreproduction, retouching and tinting.  \nPumping aura out \nFaster lenses brought more light to the photograph and some photographers began \nto make different use of the rapidly increasing technical capacities and possibilities. \nSuch photography, Benjamin argues, dissolved the murky halo which surrounded the \nearliest photographic images, rejected the spurious aura of commercial pictures and \nbrought the world in front of the camera into sharp focus and close-up, finally putting \n\"darkness entirely to flight\" (SHP: 248). In taking pictures of what was \"unremarked, \nforgotten, cast adrift\" the French photographer Atget: \n... was the first to disinfect the stifling atmosphere generated by \nconventional portrait photography in the age of decline. He cleanses \nthis atmosphere, indeed he dispels it altogether: he initiates the \nemancipation of object from aura which is the signal achievement of the \nlatest school of photography. (SHP: 249-50) \n 11 \nIn a memorable trope, Benjamin notes that the photographs of Atget \"pump the aura \nout of reality like water out of a sinking ship\" (SHP: 250). As the technology of \nmechanical reproduction displaced uniqueness and authenticity in the auratic work of \nart, authenticity became based in the practice of politics.\n11\n Atget's images are of \nrepetition and emptiness, of objects and settings left by humans as traces of their \nexistence; bootlasts, hand-carts, tables after people have finished eating but with the \ndishes not yet cleared away (SHP: 250-51). His attention to detail is combined with \nthe most rigorous, unsentimental depopulating of the Parisian cityscape and in this \nrespect, his works prefigure those of the surrealists:12 \nThey are not lonely, merely without mood; the city in these pictures \nlooks cleared out, like a lodging that has not yet found a new tenant. It \nis in these achievements that surrealist photography sets the scene for \na salutary estrangement between man and his surroundings. It gives \nfree play to the politically educated eye, under whose gaze all \nintimacies are sacrificed to the illumination of detail. (SHP: 251) \nThe auratic \"spark of contingency\" has become the demystifying, profane \n\"illumination of detail\". The photographs of Atget lend themselves to the modern \ndemand that images are brought closer to the masses through copying, and through \ninclusion in magazines. They do not attest to a specific time or place, or claim to \nrepresent any person; instead, they provide a \u201cnew way of seeing\u201d the modern world \n(SHP: 251). Even if the human figure is at the centre of photographs such as those of \nAugust Sander, this new mode follows a scientific interest in documenting the \nphysiognomy of human types, rather than producing an individual portrait. The body \nof work that records such types serves not as a \u201cpicture book\u201c to flatter the \nbourgeoisie but provides a \u201ctraining manual\u201d for those who would understand the \npolitical world of social origins (SHP: 252).13    \nPhotography unmasks reality, de-reifies it, renders it malleable as critical proximity \nreplaces contemplative distance. In this process, the close-up and the caption turn \nthe image into a vehicle for comment. The photograph illuminates the detail in order \nto pass political judgement: \"Is not the task of the photographer ... to reveal guilt and \nto point out the guilty in his photographs?\" (SHP: 256). Herein lies the progressive \npromise of the mass reproduced photograph. Benjamin writes: \n... to bring things closer to us, or rather to the masses, is just as \npassionate an inclination in our day as the overcoming of whatever is \nunique in every situation by means of its reproduction. Every day the \n 12 \nneed to possess the object in close-up in the form of a picture, or rather \na copy, becomes imperative. (SHP: 250). \nWhat photography achieves, once it is released from the fascination with aura, is an \nillumination of the world through bringing its objects closer to us, freeing them from \nthe darkness of the prehistory of photography, bringing them into the light of a critical \nhistory of culture. To meet this imperative, the task of the radical intellectual is also \nclear: \"start taking photographs\" (Benjamin 1983b: 95). \nThe photographic adventure \nFor Benjamin the various moments of the photograph were a series of ways in which \nthe medium transforms cultural history to disenchant the real: the optical \nunconscious; the transmission of aura; the representation of cultural and political \ndecay; the proto-surrealist political commentary. In his early work on photography, \nlike Benjamin before him, Barthes was trying to grasp the significance of a medium \nthat promised to capture the presence of the past with a mechanical precision that no \nprevious technique of representation had achieved. He says of the news photograph \nfor example, that it appears to have the status of a \"message without a code\" and \nappears to be the \"perfect analogon\", an exact representation of a scene. (Barthes \n1977b: 17). But techniques (trick effects, the pose of the subject, use of objects, \nlighting, references to other art work\/forms, juxtaposition to text14) enable the \nphotograph to conceal its cultural meanings and associations, behind an apparently \ndirect representation of reality. Like Benjamin, Barthes's early comments on \nphotography consider the impact of photography on consciousness and the \nparameters of space and time: \nThe type of consciousness the photograph involves is indeed truly \nunprecedented, since it establishes not a consciousness of the being-\nthere of the thing (which any copy could provoke) but an awareness of \nits having-been-there. What we have is a new space-time category: \nspatial immediacy and temporal anteriority, the photograph being an \nillogical conjunction between the here-now and the there-then. (Barthes \n1977c: 44) \nWith this notion of the \u2018having-been-there\u2019 Barthes is pointing to the same sense of \npresence that Benjamin terms the \"spark of contingency\" when he tries to understand \nthe auratic quality of early photography.  \nIt is precisely this phenomenological effect that Barthes revisited in Camera Lucida, \nlong after his preoccupation with the language of codes, connotation and denotation \n 13 \nhad faded. Initially this text appears to be a personal investigation of his own \nresponses to particular photographs that he finds provocative and stimulating, which \n\u201canimate\u201d him so that engagement with them becomes an \"adventure\" of \nphotography (CL: 19). Barthes's interest lies not in the question of photography, but \nin Photographs that evoke desire or mourning, that he reads not as illuminating a \nthematic question \u201cbut as a wound: I see, I feel, hence I notice, I observe, and I think\u201d \n(CL: 21). How do these images address him from the past? Barthes identifies the \nways that photographs become vehicles of meaning - photographers' techniques; the \nstudium; the punctum; the ecstasy of the image - and, in the final instance, the \n\u2018pathos\u2019 in the spectator\u2019s mind which moves him to respond to a photograph.  \nHe begins by briefly exploring the various subject positions in relation to the \nphotograph: the Operator, the photographer who takes the image; the Spectrum, the \nsubject of the photograph; the Spectator, the reader of the image. It is the last of \nthese that will preoccupy him. The perspective of the Operator is that of the aperture \n\u201c... through which he looks, limits, frames and perspectivises when he wants to \u2018take\u2019 \n(to surprise)\u201d the picture (CL: 10). As with Benjamin, the techniques of the \nphotographer are part of the cultural significance of the images produced, but for the \nBarthes of Camera Lucida there are only a few \u201csurprises\u201d through which the \nOperator seeks to arrest the Spectator's gaze: the rarity or novelty of the Spectrum; \nphotographic prowess;15 displays of photographic techniques;16 the lucky find (CL: \n32-3).  \nReading the Image \nWhat Barthes focuses on is how the photographic image is read. In Camera Lucida \nhe presents personal readings of particular images through which he pioneers a new \nlanguage to express the distinctive and enduring power of photographic \nrepresentation. Reminiscent of Benjamin's dialectical image, Barthes does not find \nthe auratic quality of art in the technique of photography but in primitive theatre - \nmasked and white faced performances, the Tableau Vivant - (CL: 31-32; 91; 118). As \nhe says, the \"inimitable feature\" of Photography is that \"someone has seen the \nreferent (even if it is a matter of objects) in flesh and blood or again, in person\" (CL: \n79). \nThe adventure of visually reading a photograph depends on \"the co-presence of two \ndiscontinuous elements\" (CL: 23): the studium and the punctum. The typical meaning \nof the image as a cultural object, the \"average effect\" (CL: 26) or ordinary meaning of \nthe photograph, which is the product of the reader's education within a particular \n 14 \nculture, identifies the studium. It is the polite, dispassionate, general interest which \ncould equally be described as a particular disinterest: \nThe studium is that very wide field of unconcerned desire, of various \ninterest, of inconsequential taste ... The studium is of the order of liking, \nnot of loving. (CL: 27) \nThe photographer and the viewer use a shared visual language to make \u201ca contract \narrived at between consumers and creators\u201d in which the meaning of the photograph \nis understood (CL: 28). It is at the level of the studium that the photograph takes up a \nrelation with society; to inform, to represent, to surprise, to cause to signify, to \nprovoke desire. So, Barthes suggests that news and pornographic photographs \nrepresent what they depict in a single, uninterrupted way, effecting the moment of the \nstudium but leaving the Spectator unmoved (CL: 41-42). Something else, of a \ndifferent order, is needed to spark the \"adventure\" - the punctum. \nFor Barthes the photograph comes alive, becomes a matter of love and passion, only \nwhen a detail or a fragment interrupts, disturbs or stands out from the image. This is \nthe punctum: a feature of the photograph which punctuates or punctures the studium. \nLike Benjamin's notion of aura, the punctum is neither a technical artefact nor a \nproduct of the Operator's intention and attempts to produce or mimic it inevitably \nfail.17 The punctum is a quality discovered by the Spectator alone: the accidental, the \ncoincidental, the \"spark of contingency\" within the image which 'pricks' the reader. \nUnmissable, uncoded, instantaneous, and intense, it is the fragment that rouses the \n'docile cultural subject' that is the Spectator of the studium (CL: 43). To respond to \nthe punctum, there must be an openness to the photograph which, based on the \nspectator's own particular interests and aesthetic concerns, leads to a personal, \nidiosyncratic reaction. The punctum \u201cis what I add to the photograph and what is \nnonetheless already there\u201d (CL: 55). Barthes gives as an example of the punctum the \nstrapped pumps on the feet of a woman in a photograph of an African-American \nfamily taken by James van der Zee in 1926. These shoes, whose style seems too \nyoung for the age of the woman wearing them, \"arouses great sympathy\" in Barthes, \n\"almost a kind of tenderness\" (CL: 43). The studium in this image \"\u2026 utters \nrespectability, family life, conformism, Sunday best\" but it is the punctum of the \nstrapped shoes that moves Barthes because they look out of place. Later he \nchanges his mind and suggests that the real punctum is the young woman's \nnecklace which reminds him of a similar necklace worn by his unmarried aunt who \nlived a rather sad and dreary life (CL: 53). The punctum is the detail which alerts the \nSpectator's sensibility of an era, its values and manners, its tastes and fashions, its \n 15 \naspirations and follies. It is not a quality of the photograph itself so much as a product \nof the Spectator\u2019s engagement with it. This is why the punctum is not the same for \nevery Spectator or even for the same Spectator at different viewings. However, the \ninterplay between the studium and the punctum fails to reveal the essential meaning, \nthe noeme, of photography for which Barthes is searching. For this to occur, an even \nmore intimate and painful exploration is needed. \nThe second part of Camera Lucida finds Barthes caught up in an emotional \nreviewing of old photographs of his recently deceased mother. His attention is \nsuddenly arrested by one particular image taken in 1898; his mother as a child aged \nfive, photographed with her brother (aged seven) in a Winter Garden. This is exactly \nthe kind of humiliating family album photograph Benjamin detests as the mark of \nmediocrity, but for Barthes this picture reminds him of the contingency and specificity \nof the photographic image.18 The photograph attests to the undeniable presence of \nhis mother as a child, confirming the unique, unrepeatable, historical moment. This \nbecomes the definitive characteristic of the photograph for Barthes: \n... in Photography I can never deny that the thing has been there. There \nis a superimposition here: of reality and of the past. And since this \nconstraint exists only for photography, we must consider it, by \nreduction, as the very essence, the noeme of Photography ... The name \nof Photography's noeme will therefore be: 'That-has-been', or again: the \nIntractable. (CL: 76-77) \nMuch like the aura that Benjamin finds in the Octavius Hill image, for Barthes the \nphotograph authenticates the existence of the subject; their singularity, pose, \nexpression, look - in sum, the \"air\" of the subject (CL: 107). It does so even when the \nsubject has no recollection of being present - Barthes recalls an occasion when, \ngiven a photograph of himself, he could not remember it being taken. Nevertheless, \"I \ncould not deny that I had been there (even if I did not know where)\" (CL: 85). \nThis evidential power of the photograph has a particular resonance in its presentation \nof the image of the dead, and especially, those whose death is imminent. Barthes \nwrites of Alexander Gardner's 1865 photograph of Lewis Paine, taken just prior to \nPaine\u2019s execution for the attempted assassination of Secretary of State W. H. \nSeward: \nThe photograph is handsome, as is the boy: that is the studium. But the \npunctum is: he is going to die. I read at the same time: This will be and \nthis has been; I observe with horror an anterior future of which death is \nthe stake. (CL: 96) \n 16 \n[Insert Figure 1 around here] \nThere is something profoundly sad about the \u2018that-has-been\u2019 of the photograph as \nthe newly found form of the punctum - no longer a detail but now that intensity of the \nimage which locates the referent of the spectrum as always alive, real yet in the past. \nThe Spectator brings to photographs a knowledge of the future of that referent and in \nlooking at historical photographs Barthes is aware that whatever youth and optimism \nis displayed there, these people are now dead (CL: 96). This is most painfully true of \nthe Winter Garden picture that depicts his mother, her life still to be lived: \nIn front of the photograph of my mother as a child, I tell myself: she is \ngoing to die: I shudder ... over a catastrophe which has already \noccurred. Whether or not the subject is already dead, every photograph \nis this catastrophe. (CL: 96) \nThe capacity of the photograph to be a \u201ccertificate of presence\u201d is always backwards \nlooking, a \"prophecy in reverse\" (CL: 87). The past is brought forcefully into \nconjunction with the present so that hindsight can interplay with prophecy; we know \nthe future of the past. \nWith the Winter Garden photograph Barthes reaches a point at which analysis of any \nsort has to stop in the face of grief. He bemoans the limits of the photograph as an \nobject that has no depth and presents only one surface to be explored; it is flat and \nimpenetrable (CL: 106). The \u2018camera lucida\u2019 was an artist\u2019s optical device for looking \nthrough a prism at the scene being drawn while at the same time looking at the page \non which the drawing was being formed. One eye takes in the depth of reality as the \nother constructs its two-dimensional image on the flatness of the sketchpad. For \nBarthes, the photograph is the camera lucida in reverse; we read from the two-\ndimensional image the three-dimensional reality that lies in the past, a reality \u2018That-\nhas-been\u2019 (\u00c7a-a-\u00e9t\u00e9 \u2013 CL: 80). Like the camera lucida, the photographic camera \nprovides an \u201cemanation of the referent\u201d but this time one from the past, fixed by the \ntransformation of chemicals on a plate or paper. \nConclusions \nThe medium of critique that both Benjamin and Barthes engage in is writing but both, \nin addressing a diverse range of cultural forms, find photography a particularly \nprovocative medium. For both, history is always present in cultural process and the \nconfrontation of the present with the past is an indispensable aspect of critique. The \nphotograph provides a moment about which such critique can operate, providing the \npossibility of a 'dialectical image' or a 'tableau' in which the flow of history is stopped \n 17 \nand becomes accessible in the moment. This is not however a characteristic of \nphotography in general; some photographs fail to provide any such moment if they \nare contrived to show 'aura' for Benjamin, or if there is no 'punctum' which arrests the \ngaze and stimulates reading for Barthes.  \nBenjamin's tracing of the development of photography is concerned with its ability to \npenetrate and illuminate social and material conditions. As the early capacity to \ncapture the aura of the subject is displaced by the imperatives of demystification, the \ntask of the progressive photographer becomes to pump aura out of reality, reveal its \nsecrets and thereby transform the perceptions of the masses. The photograph is \neducative, didatic; its gesture is critical and accusatory, \"to point out the guilty\" (SHP: \n256). The \u201cspark of contingency\u201d is a characteristic of photography that endures \nindependently of the artifice of the photographer or the artfulness of the subject. It \nmarks the authenticity of the image, an authenticity that at a certain point is auratic, \nat another point is political. The authenticity of the image promises the possibility of \nengaging with the culture of a period, with the specificity of modernity as it unfolds. \nBenjamin\u2019s analysis dismisses the trivial, the amateur, the personal photograph. His \ninterest is in the cultural status of photography as a medium that displaces art and \nspeaks to the masses. Barthes, while recognising the photograph as a cultural force \n(the studium), looks for the altogether more personal moment of reading and \nengaging with photographs. In grappling with the problem of why some photographs \nattract his attention, he identifies in the punctum a moment in which the Spectator is \ndrawn into an emotional relationship with the image. However, this only works with \nthose public images, the reproduced, distributed and published photographs that \nBenjamin is interested in. For Barthes, the tension of the studium and punctum is \ninsufficient to explain the attraction of those most private photographs, those that \nBenjamin dismisses as embarrassments.  \nIn confronting the images of his own biography, in particular the Winter Garden \nphotograph of his mother, Barthes discovers the potency of the photographic image \nin its testimony to reality in the past, the essence of \u2018that-has-been\u2019. Barthes \nrecognises and values what Benjamin treats as a moment of photography's history, \nthe \"spark of contingency\" which authenticates a past presence and 'wounds' the \npresent Spectator. However, this altogether more personal and emotional - both \npainful and pleasurable - engagement with the past risks leading, via pity, to \nmadness and finally to the perils of \u201cphotographic ecstasy\u201d (CL: 119). The dur\u00e9e of \nBarthes engagement with the photograph is that of the reader's biography whereas \nfor Benjamin, it is that of the epoch. \n 18 \nFor Benjamin, the photograph subjects the social and material world to sober scrutiny \nand disenchants what has been: photography\u2019s political power is as a moment of \nmechanical reproduction, bringing art to the masses. For Barthes, this same capacity \nto attest to what has been is the very thing which threatens to bring a form of re-\nenchantment, a dizzying temporal vertigo: this is the seductive secret of photography \nthat confronts the individual with the forces of history and mortality. Benjamin may \naccount for why we should concern ourselves with the photograph, but it is Barthes  \nwho suggests why we might want to. Benjamin presents us with an armoury, Barthes \npromises us an adventure. The medium of photography suggests to Benjamin a \nmeans to confront the cultural past, to study the detail of the modern epoch as it \ndevelops. But for Barthes the medium opens up the lives of those who lived before \nus, whose history might overlap with ours and whose lives entwined with ours to \nreveal the continuity of culture, the cycle of life and death, of experience and \nemotions. Photographs are pictures that have, for both Benjamin and Barthes, such a \nforceful presence in the here and now that they challenge the power of the writer to \nbring the past alive in the present. \nTD\/GG 14.08.01 \n 19 \nReferences \nBARTHES, Roland (1970) \"Historical Discourse\" in M.

An example of their 'photodynamism' is a 1912 image \n\"The Slap\", which captures the movement of the hand of one body making contact with the \nhead of another in a series of blurred images on one photograph.  \n3 Christian Metz (1991: 98) uses this term to refer to the denotative meaning of film - the \nnarrative, characters, events, landscapes - in contrast to Barthes's concept of denotation in \nthe photograph which is precisely that which is there in front of the camera and leads to the \nimage. \n4 See Konvolut Y in Benjamin 1999: 671-692. \n 22 \n                                                \n5 Including; Daguerre or the Dioramas in \"Paris - the Capital of the Nineteenth Century\" \n(Benjamin 1983a), \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\" (Benjamin \n1992c). \n6 In Mythologies he wrote on the \"The Romans in Films\", \"The Face of Garbo\", \"The \nIconography of the Abb\u00e9 Pierre\", \"The Great Family of Man\", \"Photography and Electoral \nAppeal\", \"Ornamental Cookery\" (1973) and \"The Harcourt Actor\" and \"Shock Photos\" (1979). \nSee also Barthes 1977b; 1977c. \n7 In Benjamin's discussion of Brecht, (\"What is Epic theatre?\" 1983b: 13), he describes the \nmoment when the action freezes into a tableau as one of \"dialectics at a standstill\", a moment \nwhich allows the audience to reflect on what has been happening. \n8 Benjamin notes that Daguerre's diorama was burned down in 1839, the same year that he \nannounced the invention of the daguerreotype (Benjamin 1983a: 162). \n9 Benjamin writes:  \u201cIt is through photography that we first discover the existence of this \noptical unconscious, just as we discover the instinctual unconscious through psychoanalysis\" \n(SHP: 243). Without using the phrase \u2018optical unconcious\u2019, Benjamin discusses the same idea \nin the \u201cWork of Art\u201d essay as one of the characteristics of mechanical reproduction - 1992c: \n214. \n10 As we shall see, this moment in which the photograph captures a past moment is what for \nBarthes becomes the \u2018\u2018that-has-been\u2019\u2019, the noeme or essence of the photograph. \n11 See Benjamin 1992: 218 and 220: \u201cWith Atget, photographs become standard evidence for \nhistorical occurrences, and acquire a hidden political significance.\u201d \n12 \u201cWhat renders a photograph surreal is its irrefutable pathos as a message from time past, \nand the concreteness of intimations about social class.\u201d (Sontag 1979: 54) Benjamin writes: \n\"Atget's Paris photos are the forerunners of surrealist photography; an advance party of the \nonly really broad column surrealism set in motion\" (SHP: 249). \n13 Barthes also comments on the politics of Sander\u2019s photographs (CL: 36) \n14 Benjamin asks: \"Will not the caption become the most important part of the photograph?\" \n(SHP: 256). \n15 This corresponds to Benjamin's notion of the \u2018optical unconscious\u2019 - \"a gesture \napprehended at the point in its course where the normal eye cannot arrest it\" (CL: 32) and the \nrevelation of micro-detail through close-up. \n16 \u201c... superimpressions, anamorphoses, deliberate exploitation of certain defects (blurring, \ndeceptive perspectives, trick framing)...\u201d (CL: 33) - precisely the sort of tedious visual tricks \nand contortions of the self-conscious, 'arty', 'creative' photographs which Benjamin loathes \n(SHP:254-55). \n 23 \n                                                \n17 Barthes writes: \"Certain details may 'prick' me. If they do not, it is doubtless because the \nphotographer has put them there intentionally\" (CL:47). \n18 He does not reproduce the photograph in his book because it would merely be an \n\u201cindifferent picture\u201d, at most a studium for the reader but offering \u201cno wound\u201d (CL:73). \n"}
