In the United Kingdom, there \nare over 2 million people diagnosed with diabetes, and Internet-based interventions may represent \na way of helping them self-manage their condition from home. There have been several recent \nstudies of Internet-based interventions with patients carried out in Europe [1-4] and North \nAmerica [5-8]. A report of a small study that pilot-tested the feasibility of allowing patients with \ntype 2 diabetes to co-manage their condition from home [9] showed proof of concept. The virtual \nclinic concept studied here is such a system, aimed at people receiving care for diabetes from the \nUK National Health Service (NHS), and it is enhanced by being based on the behavioral theory of \nself-efficacy [10]. The theory suggests that to enhance self-efficacy (the confidence an individual \nhas that he or she can achieve a particular objective) an intervention should increase autonomy, \nreduce negative perceptions of being different, offer vicarious learning and modelling opportunities \nfrom peers, encourage setting of achievable goals, and give rewards for such achievements. \nEnhanced self-efficacy, in turn, increases the implementation of successful self-management. A \nsystematic literature review of behavioral interventions for adolescents with type 1 diabetes found \nthat those interventions that were theoretically based were significantly more effective than those \nthat were not [11]. \nThe aim of this research was to consult stakeholder groups and explore their perspectives on the \ndesirable, important, and feasible characteristics of an Internet-based virtual clinic system for \npeople who have type 1 diabetes and use insulin pumps, and to flag any potential worries or \nconcerns. This builds on a recently conducted survey of potential users [12]. Gathering \nstakeholder perspectives is a vital first stage in order to ensure that the system developed meets \nthe needs of future users [13] and that it achieves its full potential in their eyes [14]. Currently, \nmuch of the work to gather user feedback takes place following development of the system in \nquestion. In contrast, the objective of the study reported here was to undertake detailed \nconsultation with a variety of stakeholder groups and feed their comments directly into the process \nof developing the system. It was envisaged that the virtual clinic would provide people living with \ndiabetes, and their health professionals, access to the records of their condition (including \nuploaded blood glucose readings), a messaging facility, information and advice for patients, and a \npeer-to-peer support area, thereby meeting many of the criteria identified as desirable within \nInternet-based diabetes management [15]. \n \nMethods \nIn order to gather detailed comments from the stakeholder groups identified, a qualitative \napproach was taken. Several elements were used, including focus groups, individual interviews, \nemail consensus gathering, and an expert workshop. \nParticipants in both the focus groups and interviews received an information sheet about the study \nand gave their written consent to take part. The elements of the study were approved by an NHS \nLocal Research Ethics Committee. \nFocus Groups \nThree focus groups were held with people who had type 1 diabetes and who used insulin pumps to \ncontrol their disease. These participants were recruited from a local diabetes clinic. Each focus \ngroup had between 3 and 5 participants. The total number of participants was 12 (2 male and 10 \nfemale), and all were over 16 years of age. All participants had responded to a written invitation to \ntake part in the research, indicating at least a basic level of literacy. All those who responded to \nour written invitations were subsequently asked to take part in one of the focus groups. Although \nfocus groups were held during the day and evening, a small number of those willing to take part \ncould not attend any of the sessions. These people were invited to submit their views by email, \nwhich were included in the email consensus discussed below. Focus groups were conducted at the \neducation center within the hospital at which the clinic was based, a convenient and familiar \nlocation. No health professionals were present at the focus group sessions. At each session, a \nshort demonstration was given to familiarize participants with the concepts we were planning to \ndevelop. This comprised the following elements: (1) a demonstration of an existing system that \ncould record physiological data (such as blood glucose readings) and facilitate patient\/health \nprofessional messaging, and (2) a description of some additional features we thought may be of \ninterest to potential users, including downloadable information, links to other relevant websites, \nand peer-to-peer discussion boards. The facilitator then used the topic guide to focus the \ndiscussion on the following: participants\u2019 initial reactions to the concept, the most and least \nimportant\/useful elements, whether they would be likely to use such a system, factors that may \nfacilitate or hinder use, what the benefits may be, and any concerns they may have. Sessions were \naudio-recorded and lasted an average of 1 hour. \nIndividual Interviews \nIndividual interviews were carried out with 5 health professionals from the same clinic (2 doctors, \n2 specialist nurses, 1 dietician) and with 1 representative from an insulin pump \nmanufacturer\/supplier who had emerged from the focus group discussions as an important source \nof information and support. The same demonstration was given as for the focus groups, and the \ninterviews included similar questions. All interviews were audio-recorded and lasted between 30 \nminutes and 1 hour. \nConsensus Gathering by Email \nA process of email consensus gathering was carried out with patients using Internet-based \nsystems for other chronic conditions in order to gain their views on the potential of the virtual \nclinic and their experience of using other systems. A message was posted on discussion boards \naimed at patients with long-term conditions, including asthma, epilepsy, and mental health \nproblems, and also on a discussion board for insulin pump users in order to consult further with \nthe target group for the intervention being developed. Users were invited to contribute their views \nby email. \nExpert Workshop \nAn expert workshop was held at which invited delegates from the United Kingdom discussed the \nrole of information technology (IT) in diabetes care. Delegates had a range of backgrounds, with \nexpertise in areas such as diabetes management, the use of IT in health care, and patient \ninvolvement in long-term conditions. They included academic researchers (with backgrounds as \ndiverse as primary care, psychology, psychiatry, engineering, and sociology), diabetologists, \npeople living with diabetes, and a representative from the charity Diabetes UK. Delegates \ndiscussed the proposed system in small groups and completed questionnaires addressing the same \nissues as in the focus groups and interviews. \nData Analysis \nQualitative data analysis was undertaken by the first and second author. Focus group and \ninterview transcripts, email responses from users of other systems, and the questionnaires \ncompleted during the expert workshop were all preliminarily analyzed independently by each \nauthor using a thematic analysis approach. Recurrent themes were identified as they emerged \nfrom the data, rather than on the basis of researcher preconceptions. Following this, the two \nauthors held an analysis meeting at which the emergent themes identified by each were compared \nand discussed. Following agreement on these, each author undertook a full analysis of \napproximately half the transcripts, with a small overlap to allow comparison of theme \ninterpretation and allocation of data extracts to particular themes. \n \nResults \nSix key themes, some with subthemes, were identified from the data and are described in detail \nbelow: \n1. communication between patients and health professionals  \n2. presentation of patient data and permanency of the record  \n3. the importance and value of peer support  \n4. awareness of the personal nature of diabetes  \n5. how an Internet-based system would fit with the current provision of care  \n6. an Internet-based system may not be suitable for all people with diabetes \nCommunication Between Patients and Health Professionals \nThe facility to send and receive secure messages through an Internet-based system was largely \nwelcomed by all the stakeholder groups consulted, although there were some concerns. For health \nprofessionals, one of the key benefits was that the means through which they communicated with \ntheir patients outside of their face-to-face appointments would be more standardized. Having an \nasynchronous messaging system was seen to be beneficial as both parties could check their \nmessages when it was convenient for them and fit this into their other activities, thereby saving a \nlot of time. This concurs with previous research [16,17]. For example, one health professional (HP) \nillustrated the time taken in trying to respond to a patient enquiry that had been left on the clinic \nanswer phone: \nI rang somebody and she said, \u201cI\u2019m right in the middle of shopping in [town]. Can you ring me \nback?\u201d So, there\u2019s a lot of time that you spend sort of ringing them. Or, I\u2019ve got a school teacher, \nand she\u2019s rang four times today and I have rang her back several times, and you know eventually \n[that] you get to talk but it might be a couple of days, so I think quite a lot of our patients feel \nthat it\u2019s easier to email us. [HP6] \nSimilarly, a focus group participant (FGP) explained how she had largely given up trying to seek \nadvice through the clinic helpline as she found having to leave a message and waiting to be called \nback simply unworkable: \nIt\u2019s so hard.... You have to leave a message, they ring you back, you\u2019re in an open office so you \ncan\u2019t talk, so you just bash your way through it and hope it\u2019s going to come out right at the end. \n[FGP3] \nBeing able to send a message and receive a reply was therefore welcomed by patients, so long as \nthe system was adequately supported and health professionals responded to messages in a timely \nmanner [18]. There were potential concerns raised by some health professionals that the number \nof patient contacts would increase and that the workload of the consultants would similarly \nincrease since most patient messages had previously been filtered by the specialist nurses. These \nwere fairly minor concerns though and did not outweigh the perceived benefits. \nPresentation of Patient Data and Permanency of the Record \nOne of the key advantages of the proposed Internet-based system identified by health \nprofessionals was the benefit of having ready access to a patient\u2019s blood glucose readings. The \nadvantages were two-fold: (1) having up-to-date results readily accessible, and (2) having results \nin a standard format. At present, health professionals were often faced with results in various \nformats: \nSome of them [records kept by patients] might be too scribbled and not really very clear.... But, \nyes, scraps of paper might have, sometimes, [the time of day]...written in the corner, and you\u2019re \ntrying to see the time of the day and sort of trying to make them in your head into [a] date profile \nto some extent. So, they can be a bit difficult, yes. [HP2] \nThe permanency of the record was also seen as beneficial by health professionals since, in contrast \nto a paper diary, the readings would not leave with the patient and would still be available for \nreview and reflection at a later date. The potential for use as a teaching and training tool was also \nraised. In contrast, patients were more divided on the benefits of uploading their results. Those \nwho found recording their readings problematic welcomed anything that would make it easier and \nmore convenient, but for others the system was seen to offer nothing new. However, all patients \nrecognized the benefit of the health professional having access to their readings when dealing with \nqueries. \nThe Importance and Value of Peer Support \nIn common with other research [5,19,20], one of the most valuable elements of the system \nidentified by patients, and also recognized by health professionals, was peer-to-peer support. \nPatients in particular identified two key ways in which such support would be useful. First, being \nable to pick up tips and suggestions for managing their diabetes was viewed as beneficial, even for \nthose who had had diabetes for some time: \nBut there are so many things that you can come across for the first time, and the one I had to \nseek advice on was the flu injection last year, which caused chaos, and I thought, \u201cWell, is this the \nflu injection or is there something else that I\u2019m missing?\u201d.... But again, a [discussion] board like \nthis, just to push the question in and see what response you get back... [FGP6] \nSecond, being able to communicate with someone who understood what they were going through \nwas considered very valuable by patients, particularly for those who did not know others with \ndiabetes, thereby demonstrating the potential of Internet-based communication to move beyond \nthe individual\u2019s usual sphere of contacts. \nWithin my life, around work, around home, and around socializing, I know no one else with \ndiabetes, so to be able to get on...[the] Internet and sort of like to be able to have a chat with \nsomebody... Even like you say, sometimes it might just be for a moan, but sometimes you can get \nso frustrated with it that you just want to be able to take it all out.... You want to be able to talk to \nsomeone, but finding... You talk to your partner and you talk to your friends, but they don\u2019t always \nunderstand what you\u2019re saying. [FGP9] \nThe health professionals also recognized the potential benefits of peer-to-peer support for their \npatients, particularly the ways in which Internet-based provision extended the group sessions \ncurrently offered at the clinic. \nWe have group sessions...and they are teaching each other...from their experience.... And they\u2019ll \nbe able to do that on a regular basis, on a daily basis, rather than on a three-monthly basis, and \nthey\u2019ll all be there in the chat room, potentially, rather than just the people who turned up to the \ngroup clinic. [HP1] \nHowever, there were some minor concerns among health professionals that the peer-to-peer \nsupport could lead to the \u201cpropagation of myths\u201d and to individuals passing on what had worked \nfor them to others for whom it may be inappropriate. It was generally felt that monitoring the \ntopics under discussion would be sufficient to counter these concerns. The issue of patients\u2019 \nawareness and appreciation of the individual nature of diabetes is discussed below. A recent \nsystematic review of the effects of online peer-to-peer interactions [21] found no evidence to \nsupport concerns of causing harm, although it also failed to find robust evidence of any health \nbenefit. \nAwareness of the Personal Nature of Diabetes \nAs stated above, one of the concerns health professionals had about the peer-to-peer support was \nthat patients using it may not realize that what had worked for one person may not work for \nothers: \nPatients frequently want to propagate what has been good for them, and it might not be good for \neverybody, if you know what I\u2019m saying. They might have found some particular way of dealing \nwith situations...but it doesn\u2019t always apply to everybody. [HP1] \nHowever, it was clear from the focus groups with patients that they were very well aware of how \ndiabetes affected them personally and that this may differ markedly between individuals. The \nknowledge and experience they had built up from managing their diabetes on a day-to-day basis \nwere substantial, and they spoke at length about the need to evaluate suggestions posted on \ndiscussion boards in the light of their personal situation. The following is a typical example: \nWhatever I read on there [the discussion board] may be useful, but I know it\u2019s not individually \ndesigned for me. So, overall it can be a useful guide when you start out, but you really do have to \nknow your own system, don\u2019t you. [FGP8] \nThis ability on the part of potential users to appraise the information posted on a discussion board \nand evaluate whether it is likely to be useful to them, together with existing research \ndemonstrating that most information posted on boards of this kind is accurate (or very quickly \ncorrected by other participants) [22], indicates that the concerns voiced by health professionals \nare likely to be largely unfounded. \nHow an Internet-Based System Would Fit With the Current Provision of Care \nThe general consensus among the focus group participants and health professionals was that the \nproposed Internet-based system would fit well with existing clinic provision. The system would \nprovide a useful means of communication and support between routine clinic appointments and \nwould bring benefits in terms of increased standardization, more efficient means of \ncommunication, and extended scope of current group consultations through the use of Internet-\nbased asynchronous discussion boards and real-time chat rooms. Some concerns were raised \nabout a potential increase in the demand of health professionals\u2019 time for dealing with messages \nreceived from patients, and this was identified as a potential factor that could hinder usage. \nHowever, the general consensus was that, in the local clinic at least, any additional time would be \nminimal and may well be offset through the time savings brought about by other benefits. This is \none of the issues to be explored in the planned pilot study. \nAn Internet-Based System May Not Be Suitable for All \nThe vast majority of participants in the stakeholder consultation raised the point that an Internet-\nbased system of the type proposed would not be suitable or appropriate for all people with \ndiabetes. The main issue centered on the need for potential users to be comfortable with the \nrequired technology and to have a computer with Internet access. It was suggested that this may \nlimit potential users to those who are younger and more familiar with technology, as supported by \nresearch by Gim\u00e9nez-P\u00e9rez et al [23]. However, a recent study by McKay et al [6] has shown that \nnovice computer users will participate in an Internet-based system to assist their self-\nmanagement. A further concern, raised particularly by a health professional, was that the system \ncould be unsuitable for those with a poor understanding of their condition or for whom diabetes is \nonly one of many health problems. \n \nDiscussion \nThe research was successful in consulting stakeholder groups to explore their perspectives on the \ndesirable, important, and feasible characteristics of an Internet-based system for diabetes. \nInvolvement of stakeholders is a vital early stage in the development of a complex intervention, \nyet all too often their views are only gathered in later stages. Stakeholders have clear and relevant \nviews on what such a system should provide, and these views can be captured and synthesized \nwith relative ease. In this case, we identified 6 themes that are supported by findings from \nprevious studies on the perceived convenience of an asynchronous messaging system [16,17] and \nthe importance and value of peer-to-peer support [5,19,20]. The themes also contribute to debate \nabout who is likely to use Internet-based systems and suggest that patients are eminently capable \nof assessing advice posted by peers on a discussion board and relating it to their personal \nsituation. By basing the focus groups and interviews in an existing diabetes clinic, the research \nwas able to suggest that an Internet-based system is likely to fit well with existing care provision \nas well as to explore the likely impact on health professionals\u2019 time. \nThe main strength of this study is the involvement of a diverse range of stakeholders in detailed \nconsultation during the development stage of an Internet-based intervention. The diverse range of \nmethods used to involve these stakeholders (ie, interviews, focus groups, email consensus \ngathering, and an expert workshop) is also a key strength. In particular, the use of focus groups \nand a workshop means that we allowed participants to discuss and develop each others\u2019 \nperspectives. However, there are also some limitations to the study. Patients were self-selecting \nvolunteers, so they may have different views from those who did not volunteer to participate. It is \nnoticeable, for example, that more women than men volunteered to take part. There is also a \npotential issue concerning how the perspectives of patients using insulin pumps relate to those of \npatients who control their type 1 diabetes through other means. We are aware that much of the \nfeedback from patients does not specifically relate to their use of an insulin pump; rather, it is \nconcerned with more generic issues such as communication with their health professionals and the \nvalue placed on peer support. However, we acknowledge that further stakeholder consultation with \nthe target group(s) would be necessary before the intervention could be developed for diabetes \npatients who do not use insulin pumps. \nThis consultation demonstrated that an Internet-based system is attractive to the stakeholders \nconsulted during the course of this study and has led to the design of a system that is able to meet \ntheir needs. This system has now been developed and is being evaluated in a pilot study. \n \nAcknowledgments \nThe authors wish to thank all those who participated in the research and Voluntis for allowing \naccess to their software for demonstration.
