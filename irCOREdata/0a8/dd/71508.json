INTRODUCTION\nMOBILITY tracking is one of the most important fea-tures of wireless cellular communication networks [1].\nData from two types of station are usually used: base stations\n(BSs) the position of which is known, and mobile stations\n(MSs) or mobile users for which location and motion are\nestimated.\nMobility tracking techniques can be divided in two\ngroups [2]: i) methods in which the position, speed and\npossibly the acceleration are estimated, and ii) conventional\ngeo-location techniques, which only estimate the position\ncoordinates. Previous approaches for mobility tracking rely on\nKalman filtering [2]\u2013[4], hidden semi-Markov models [4]\u2013[6]\nand sequential Monte Carlo (MC) filtering [7].\nManuscript received November 17, 2005; revised October 23, 2006 and\nApril 16, 2007; accepted July 3, 2007.

Ristic is with DSTO, Australia (email: branko.ristic@dsto.defence.\ngov.au).\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/TWC.2007.05912.\nTwo types of measurements are usually used: pilot signal\nstrength from different BSs measured at the mobile unit and\nthe corresponding propagation times.\nThe Kalman-filtering algorithms developed in [2] for real-\ntime tracking of a MS in cellular networks have limitations\ndue to the necessity for linearisation. This leads to the\nshortcomings in accuracy caused by this approximation. The\ntwo algorithms proposed in [2] use the pilot signal strengths\nfrom neighbouring BSs (i.e., the Received Signal Strength\nIndication (RSSI)), although signal measurements such as\ntime-of-arrival (TOA) are also suitable. The model of the\nMS is considered to be linear, driven by a discrete command\nprocess corresponding to the MS acceleration. The command\nprocess is modelled as a semi-Markov process over a finite\nset of acceleration levels. The first algorithm in [2] consists\nof an averaging filter for processing pilot signal strength\nmeasurements and two Kalman filters, one to estimate the dis-\ncrete command process and the other to estimate the mobility\nstate. The second algorithm employs a single Kalman filter\nwithout pre-filtering the measurements and is able to track a\nMS even when a limited set of pilot signal measurements is\navailable. Both proposed algorithms can be used to predict\nfuture mobility behaviour, which can be utilised in resource\nallocation applications.\nYang and Wang [7] developed an MC algorithm for joint\nmobility tracking and hard handoff detection in cellular\nnetworks. In their work, mobility tracking involves on-line\nestimation of the location and speed of the mobile, whereas\nhandoff detection involves on-line prediction of the pilot signal\nstrength at some future time instants. The optimal solution of\nboth problems is prohibitively complex due to the nonlinear\nnature of the system. The MC joint mobility tracking and\nhandoff detection algorithm designed in [7] is compared with a\nmodified EKF and it is shown that the MC technique provides\nmuch better accuracy than the EKF.\nIn this paper we focus on mobility tracking based on signal\nstrength measurements. In contrast to previous work [2], [3],\n[7], [8], mobility tracking is formulated as an estimation\nproblem of hybrid systems which have a base state vector and\na mode (modal) state vector. The base states are continuously\nevolving, whilst the modal states can undergo abrupt changes.\nThis formulation together with the sequential MC approach\nprovides us with a powerful tool for mobility tracking.

PROBLEM FORMULATION\nWe consider the problem of mobility tracking in cellular\nnetworks within the sequential MC framework. The dynamics\nof the mobility unit is described by the equation\nxk = f(xk\u22121,mk,uk,wk), (1)\nwhere xk \u2208 Rnx is the system base state, uk \u2208 Rnu specifies\nthe command process, and wk \u2208 Rnw is the state noise, with\nk \u2208 N being the discrete time and N is the set of natural\nnumbers. The modal (discrete) state mk characterising the\ndifferent system modes (regimes), can take values over a finite\nset M, i.e., mk \u2208M.\nThe measurement equation is of the form\nzk = h(xk,vk), (2)\nwhere zk \u2208 Rnz is the observation, and vk \u2208 Rnv is the\nmeasurement noise. Functions f(.) and h(.) are nonlinear in\ngeneral.\nIt is assumed that the observations are taken at discrete\ntime points Tk, with a discretisation time step T . The ac-\nceleration uk of the mobile unit is usually highly correlated,\nbut sometimes it undergoes rapid changes caused by various\nreasons such as traffic lights and road turns. Following [3],\n[7], [8], the motion of the moving user can be modeled as a\ndynamic system driven by a command uk = (ux,k, uy,k)\u2032 and\na correlated random acceleration rk = (rx,k, ry,k)\u2032 at time k,\ni.e., the total acceleration is ak = uk + rk (see Fig. 1).\nIII. MOBILITY STATE AND OBSERVATION MODELS\nDifferent state mobility models have previously been used in\ncellular networks such as the constant acceleration model [9]\nand Singer-type models [2], [4], [10]. In this paper we choose\na discrete-time Singer-type model [7] because it captures\ncorrelated accelerations and allows for prediction of position,\nspeed and acceleration of mobile users. Originally proposed in\n[11] for tracking targets in military systems, the Singer model\nhas served as a basis for developing effective manoeuvre mod-\nels for various applications (see [12] for a detailed survey),\nincluding user mobility patterns. In the original Singer model\nthere is no control process and the acceleration is considered\nas a random process, which has a time autocorrelation. The\nSinger-type model from [2] includes a command process in\nexplicit form. Yang and Wang consider a simpler form of this\nmobility model [7]. In our previous paper [13] we investigated\nthe Singer-type model adopted for mobility tracking by [2].\nHowever, we found that the model of [7] gives better results\nand at the same time is simpler since it enables a more efficient\ncalculation of the PCRLBs. In this paper we adopt their model.\nThe state of the moving mobile at time instant k is defined\nby the vector xk = (xk, x\u02d9k, x\u00a8k, yk, y\u02d9k, y\u00a8k)\u2032 where xk and yk\nspecify the position, x\u02d9k and y\u02d9k specify the speed, and x\u00a8k and\ny\u00a8k specify the acceleration in the x and y directions in a two-\ndimensional space.\nThe motion of the mobility user can be described by the\nequation\nxk = A(T, \u03b1)xk\u22121 +Bu(T )uk +Bw(T )wk, (3)\nwhere uk = (ux,k, uy,k)\u2032 is a discrete-time command process\nand the respective matrices in (3) are of the form\nA(T, \u03b1) =\n(\nA\u02dc 03\u00d73\n03\u00d73 A\u02dc\n)\n,Bi(T ) =\n(\nB\u02dci 03\u00d71\n03\u00d71 B\u02dci\n)\n,\n(4)\nA\u02dc=\n\uf8eb\uf8ed1 T T 2\/20 1 T\n0 0 \u03b1\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 , B\u02dcu=\n\uf8eb\uf8edT 2\/2T\n0\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 , B\u02dcw=\n\uf8eb\uf8edT 2\/2T\n1\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 .\n(5)\nThe subscript i in the matrix B(T ) in (4) stands for u or w\nrespectively. The random process wk is a 2\u00d71 vector, T is the\ndiscretisation period. The parameter \u03b1 is the reciprocal of the\nmanoeuvre time constant and thus depends on how long the\nmanoeuvre lasts. Since wk is a white noise, E[wkw\u2032k+j ] = 0,\nfor j 6= 0. The covariance matrix Q of wk is Q = \u03c32wI , where\nI denotes the unit matrix and \u03c3w is the standard deviation.\nThe unknown command processes ux,k and uy,k are mod-\nelled as a first-order Markov chain that takes values from a\nset of acceleration levels Mx and My , and the process uk\ntakes values from the set M =Mx\u00d7My = {m1, . . . ,mM},\nwith transition probabilities piij = P (uk =mj |uk\u22121 =mi),\ni, j = 1, . . . ,M and initial probability distribution \u00b5i,0 =\nP{m = mi} for modes mi \u2208 M such that \u00b5i,0 \u2265 0 and\u2211M\ni=1 \u00b5i,0 = 1.\nA. Observation Model\nA commonly used model [2], [7] in cellular networks for\nthe distance between a mobile and a given base station (BS)\nrelies on the RSSI, which is the pilot signal strength received\nat the mobile. Denote by zk,i the RSSI signal received by\na given mobile from the i-th BS with coordinates (ai, bi) at\ntime k. The RSSI can be modelled as a sum of two terms: path\nloss and shadow fading. Fast fading is neglected assuming that\na low-pass filter is used to attenuate the Rayleigh or Rician\nfade. Therefore, the RSSI (measured in dB) that the mobile\nMIHAYLOVA et al.: MOBILITY TRACKING IN CELLULAR NETWORKS USING PARTICLE FILTERING 3\nunit receives from a particular BS i at time k can be modelled\nas the following function\nzk,i = z0,i \u2212 10\u03b7log10(dk,i) + vk,i, (6)\nwhere z0,i is a constant characterising the transmission power\nof the BS, depending on factors such as wavelength, antenna\nheight and gain of cell i; \u03b7 is a slope index (typically \u03b7 = 2\nfor highways and \u03b7 = 4 for microcells in a city); dk,i =\u221a\n(xk \u2212 ai)2 + (yk \u2212 bi)2 is the distance between the mobile\nunit and the base station; (ai, bi) is the position of the i-th\nBS; vk,i is the logarithm of the shadowing component, which\nwas found in [3] to be a zero mean, stationary Gaussian\nprocess with standard deviation \u03c3v,i, typically from 4 \u2013 8\ndB. The shadowing component can considerably worsen the\nestimation process as it is shown in [2], [4]. This difficulty\ncan be overcome by pre-filtering the measurements (e.g. by an\naveraging filter [2]) in order to reduce the observation noise.\nTo locate the mobile station (MS) in a two-dimensional\nplane, a minimum of three distance measurements to neigh-\nbouring BSs are sufficient to enable triangulation. Within\nthe GSM system the MS is constantly monitoring up to 7\nneighbouring BSs in order to establish the need for handovers.\nFor the considered problem the observation vector consists\nof the three largest RSSI denoted zk,1, zk,2, zk,3. Hence, the\nmeasurement equation is of the form\nzk = h(xk) + vk, (7)\nwith h(xk) = (h1(xk), h2 (xk), h3(xk))\u2032, hi(xi,k) = z0,i \u2212\n10\u03b7log(dk,i), a measurement vector zk = (zk,1, zk,2, zk,3)\u2032,\nshadowing components vk = (vk,1, vk,2, vk,3)\u2032 assumed to\nbe uncorrelated both in time and space and having Gaussian\ndistribution, vk,i = N (0, \u03c32v,i).\nIV. MOBILITY TRACKING AND PREDICTION WITHIN\nBAYESIAN FRAMEWORK\nWe now consider the sequential estimation of the mobility\nof a user within the Bayesian framework. Since the command\nprocess u is unknown, we are considering a hybrid particle\nxk = (x\u2032k,m\n\u2032\nk)\n\u2032 that fully characterises the target state\nand mode. The mobility state xk can be evaluated at each\ntime instant from the conditional probability density function\np(xk|z1:k) and a set of measurements z1:k , {z1, . . . , zk}\nup to time instant k via the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation\np(xk|z1:k\u22121)=\n\u222b\nRnx\np(xk|xk\u22121)p(xk\u22121|z1:k\u22121)dxk\u22121. (8)\nAfter the arrival of the measurement zk at time k, the posterior\nstate probability density function (pdf) can be updated via\nBayes rule\np(xk|z1:k) = p(zk|xk)p(xk|z1:k\u22121)\np(zk|z1:k\u22121) , (9)\nwhere p(zk|z1:k\u22121) is a normalising constant. The analytical\nsolution to the above equations is intractable. Hence, we utilise\nthe MC technique [14] which has proven to be very suitable\nand powerful for dealing with nonlinear system dynamics.\nThe MC approach relies on a sample-based construction of\nthese probability density functions. Multiple particles (sam-\nples) of the variables of interest are generated, each one\nassociated with a weight which characterises the belief that the\nobject is in this state. An estimate of the variable of interest\nis obtained by the weighted sum of particles. Two major\nstages can be distinguished: prediction and update. During\nthe prediction each particle is modified according to the state\nmodel, including the addition of random noise in order to\nsimulate the effect of the noise on the variable of interest.\nThen in the update stage, each particle\u2019s weight is re-evaluated\nbased on the new sensor data. A resampling procedure is\ndealing with the elimination of particles with small weights\nand replicates the particles with higher weights.\nA. A Particle Filter for Mobility Tracking\nThe developed particle filter (PF) is based on multiple\nmodels for the unknown acceleration u. A detailed scheme\nof the PF is given below, where N denotes the number of\nparticles.\nA particle filter for mobility tracking\nInitialisation\nI. k = 0, for j = 1, . . . , N ,\ngenerate samples {x(j)0 \u223c p(x0),m(j)0 \u223c P0(m) },\nwhere P0(m) are the initial mode probabilities for the\naccelerations and set initial weights W (j) = 1\/N .\nII.

(10)). Other\nrefined schemes for accounting for constraints can also be\napplied [17].\nV. A RAO-BLACKWELLISED PARTICLE FILTER FOR\nMOBILITY TRACKING\nA major drawback of particle filtering is that it can become\nprohibitively expensive when a large number of particles is\nused. However, the complexity can be reduced by a procedure\ncalled Rao-Blackwellisation [17]\u2013[23].\nRao-Blackwellisation is a technique for improving particle\nfiltering by analytically marginalising some of the variables\n(linear, Gaussian) from the joint posterior distribution. The\nlinear part of the system model is then estimated by a Kalman\nfilter (KF), an optimal estimator, whilst the nonlinear part is\nestimated by a PF. This leads to the fact that a KF is attached\nto each particle. In the mobility tracking problem the positions\nof the mobile unit are estimated with a PF, whilst the speeds\nand accelerations with a KF. Since the measurement equation\nis highly nonlinear, the particle filter is used to approximate\nthis distribution. After estimating the positions, these estimates\nare given to the KF as measurements. As a result of the\nmarginalisation, the variance of the estimates can be reduced\ncompared with the standard PF.\nSimilarly to the Rao-Blackwellisation approach, the mixture\nKalman filtering approach proposed by Chen and Liu [24]\nrepresents the system in a linear conditional dynamic model.\nIn this way the problem is solved by multiple Kalman filters\nrun with the MC sampling approach. A formulation of the\nRao-Blackwellisation problem is given in [25], [26] in a way\ndifferent from that in [20]. In the implementation of our Rao-\nBlackwellised PF for mobility tracking we follow the approach\nproposed in [19] and [20]. In contrast to these works we design\na RBPF which has a command process in the system model.\nThe mobility model (1)-(2) is rewritten in the form(\nxpfk\nxkfk\n)\n=\n(\nI Apf\n0 Akf\n)(\nxpfk\u22121\nxkfk\u22121\n)\n+\n(\nBpfu\nBkfu\n)\nuk\n+\n(\nBpfw\nBkfw\n)\nwk, (13)\nzk = h(x\npf\nk ) + vk, (14)\nwhere xpf = (x, y)\u2032, \u2018pf\u2019 is short for particle filter, xkf =\n(x\u02d9, x\u00a8, y\u02d9, y\u00a8)\u2032, \u2018kf\u2019 is short for Kalman filter and w is assumed\nGaussian. Equations (13)-(14) have the same properties as\nequations (1)-(2). Since the noise wk is Gaussian,\nwk =\n(\nwpfk\nwkfk\n)\n\u2208 N \u223c (0,Q),Q =\n(\nQpf M\nM \u2032 Qkf\n)\n, (15)\nThe mobility model is a Singer-type model which accounts\nfor correlations between the state vector components. Hence,\nwe cannot assume that the process noise wpf is uncorrelated\nwith wkf , i.e. M 6= 0.\nInstead of directly estimating the pdf p(xk|z1:k), with the\nentire state vector, consider the pdf p(xpfk ,x\nkf\nk |z1:k). Using\nthe Bayes rule, this pdf can be factorised into two parts\np(xpfk ,x\nkf\nk |z1:k) = p(xkfk |xpfk , z1:k)p(xpf |z1:k). (16)\nSince the measurements z1:k are conditionally independent on\nxkfk , the probability p(x\nkf\nk |xpfk , z1:k) can be written as\np(xkfk |xpfk ,z1:k) = p(xkfk |xpfk ). (17)\nConsider now the system\nxkfk = A\nkfxkfk\u22121 +B\nkf\nu uk +B\nkf\nw w\nkf\nk ,\nzk = Apfx\nkf\nk\u22121 +B\npf\nu uk +B\npf\nw w\npf\nk , (18)\nwhere zk = xpfk \u2212 f(xpfk ). Since the system (18) is linear\nand Gaussian, the optimal solution is provided by the KF. We\ncan assume a Gaussian form of the pdf (17), i.e.\np(xkfk |xpfk ) \u223c N (x\u02c6kfk|k\u22121,P kfk|k\u22121), (19)\nwhere the estimate vector x\u02c6kfk|k\u22121 and the corresponding\ncovariance matrix P kfk|k\u22121 are calculated by the Kalman filter.\nThe second pdf from (16) can be written recursively [19]\np(xpfk |z1:k) =\np(zk|xpfk )p(xpfk |xpf1:k\u22121)\np(zk|z1:k\u22121) p(x\npf\n1:k\u22121|z1:k\u22121).\n(20)\nDue to the nonlinear measurement equation we apply a PF\nto solve (20). The weights are recursively calculated based on\nthe likelihoods p(zk|xpf,(j)k ). The particles will be sampled\naccording to p(xpf,(j)k |xpf,(j)1:k\u22121). Using the state equation for\nthe xpf from (13) and having in mind (19), the prediction\nstep in the particle filter can be performed as follows\nx\npf,(j)\nk+1 \u223c N (xpf,(j)k +Apf x\u02c6kf,(j)k|k\u22121 +Bpfu u(j)k+1,\nApfP\nkf,(j)\nk|k\u22121(A\npf )\u2032 +Bpfw Q\npf (Bpfw )\n\u2032.

Since the hybrid estimation problem deals with joint\nestimation of the state vector xk and the mode variable mk,\nthe PCRLB is the inverse Jk of the information matrix and\nis defined as follows [29]\nJk , E{[\u2207Yk log p(Yk,z1:k)][\u2207Yk log p(Yk, z1:k)]\u2032},\n(38)\nwhere Yk = [Xk,Mk]\u2032, with Mk = {m1, . . . ,mM} being\nthe random regime sequence; \u2207Yk is the first-order partial\nderivative operator with respect to Yk. The analytical deriva-\ntion of the PCRLB for hybrid state estimation is a difficult\nproblem. In the derivation of the PCRLB we follow the\napproach from [17] (Ch. 4, p. 76).\nWhen the target trajectory is generated in a deterministic\nway and the sequence of modes is deterministic, then the\nPCRLB is identical to the covariance matrix propagation of\nthe Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with Jacobians evaluated\nat the true state vector xk and true regimes. This is a very\n\u201coptimistic\u201d bound. This bound is often calculated in practice\n[17] and most tracking system specifications consider purely\ndeterministic trajectories. In our work we also calculate the\nPCRLB for a deterministic trajectory. If the target trajectory\nis deterministic, but the sequence of modes is random, the\nPCRLB can be calculated in a similar way [17].\nVII. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION\nExample 1. The developed MC algorithms have been eval-\nuated over a conventional hexagonal cellular network (similar\nto those in [7]). It is supposed that a map of the cellu-\nlar network is available and the centre coordinates of the\nbase stations are known. The simulated service area contains\n64 base stations with cell radius of 2 km, as shown in\nFig. 2. The mobile can move to any cell of the network\nwith varying speed and acceleration. The sequence of modes\nin the testing scenario is generated in a deterministic way.\nShort-time manoeuvres are followed by uniform motions. The\ndiscrete-time command processes ux,k and uy,k can change\nwithin the range [\u22125, 5] [m\/s2]. The command process uk\nin the filters is assumed to be a Markov chain, taking values\nbetween the following acceleration levels M = Mx \u00d7My =\n{(0.0, 0.0), (3.5, 0.0), (0.0, 3.5), (0.0,\u22123.5), (\u22123.5, 0.0)},\nin units of [m\/s2]. The simulated trajectory of the mobile is\ngenerated deterministically according to the mobility model\n(3) and, with this trajectory, the RSSI signals are randomly\ngenerated according to the observation equation (7) with\ndifferent random noise realisations for each simulation run.\nThe randomness of the RSSI comes from the randomness of\nthe shadowing component. At any sampling time, the observed\nRSSI signal is chosen to be the three largest signal powers\namong all 64 BSs in the network. The simulation parameters\nare summarised in Table 1.\n3500 4000 4500 5000 5500 6000 6500 7000 7500\n8500\n9000\n9500\n10000\n10500\n11000\n11500\nx coordinate, [m]\ny\n c\no\no\nrd\nin\nat\ne,\n [\nm\n]\n \n \nBS\nBS\ntrajectory\nEKF\nPF: N=300\nRBPF: N=300\nFig. 2.

The RBPF\nand PF outperform the EKF. This is very pronounced during\nthe manoeuvres where the EKF peak dynamic errors are the\nhighest. Figures 6-9 presents results from the PF and RBPF\nwith a different number of particles. The position RMSE of the\nPF increases with N = 100 compared with the case with N =\n500 (Figures 6-7). The RBPF, on the other hand exhibits very\ngood performance with a small number of particles (Figures\n8-9, N = 200) which is his advantage.\nThe trade-off between accuracy and complexity is an im-\nportant issue and for marginalised PFs has been analysed in\n[31].

PF Position RMSE (x and y combined) of the PF with N =\n100, 200, 300 and 1000.\nPF is working with N = 500 particles, and the RBPF with\n200 particles, the average computational time of the RBPF is\nreduced by 60% compared with the PF. If the RBPF operates\nwith 100 particles, the reduction of its computational time\ncompared with the PF with N = 500 is more than 70% with\nreduced accuracy.\nIn conclusion, the developed RBPF has similar accuracy to\nthe PF with respect to the position and speed, with decreased\ncomputational time when we use a small number of particles,\ne.g., N = 200. The PF accuracy is worsen when N < 500.\nFigure 10 shows the accuracy of the algorithms for\ndifferent numbers of particles and the average computational\ntime for one cycle of the algorithms over 100 MC runs. It\ncan be seen from the table, that position RMSEs of the RBPF\nwith N=200 particles is nearly the same as the position RMS\nerrors of the PF with N=300. Thus, a similar performance\ncan be achieved by the RBPF with decreased computational\nresources.\n8 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS, VOL. 6, NO. 10, OCTOBER 2007\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\nTime, [s]\nS\np\nee\nd\n R\nM\nS\nE\n (\nx\n a\nn\nd\n y\n c\no\nm\nb\nin\ned\n),\n [\nm\n\/s\n]\n N100\n N200\n N300 N1000\nFig. 7.

The performance of the mobility tracking al-\ngorithms has been investigated with real RSSIs, collected\nfrom BSs in Glasgow, United Kingdom. The mobile station\nwas a vehicle driving in the city centre. More than 400 BSs\nare available in the area where the car operated. However,\nonly data from the six with the highest RSSIs were provided\nto the algorithms. Figure 11 presents the map of the urban\nenvironment, with the nearest base stations and the trajectory\nof the car (shown augmented in Figure 12). The vehicle\ntrajectory contains both patterns with sharp manoeuvres and\nrectilinear motion, including a stretch at the end where the\nvehicle is parked. Additional information for the road is\nincluded as position constraints in the algorithms. The MC\nalgorithms have shown efficiency in all these conditions. Apart\nfrom the signal strengths, a GPS system collected the actual\npositions of the moving MS, with the sampling period, T =\n0.5 s. Figure 13 shows the actual MS trajectory together with\nthe estimated trajectories and Figure 14 gives the respective\nposition RMSEs.\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\nTime, [s]\nS\np\nee\nd\n R\nM\nS\nE\n (\nx\n a\nn\nd\n y\n c\no\nm\nb\nin\ned\n),\n [\nm\n\/s\n]\nN=100\nN=200\nN=300\nN=1000\nFig. 9.

Table containing RMSEs (averaged over the whole time period) of\nthe MC algorithms for different numbers of particles, from the EKF, and the\nrespective computational time. All results are from 100 MC runs.\nThe robustness of the algorithms to outliers and miss-\ning data can be increased when the measurement error is\nmodeled with a mixture of Gaussians [32]. In this partic-\nular implementation, we present results with one Gaussian\ncomponent, p(vk) = N (\u00b5v,\u03c32v), where the nonzero mean\n\u00b5v and the covariance \u03c32v are calculated from RSSI data\n(\u00b5v = (\u22121.96,\u22124.66,\u22123.23)\u2032, \u03c3v = diag{3.93, 6.99, 6.20}).\nThe other parameters of the filters are: \u03c3w = 0.00015, \u03b1 =\n0.1, \u03b7 = 4, Vmax = 10 [m\/s] and M = Mx \u00d7 My =\n{(0.0, 0.0), (5.5, 0.0), (0.0, 5.5), (0.0,\u22125.5), (\u22125.5, 0.0)}.\nThe advantages of the MC methods compared to the EKF\ninclude their ability to easily incorporate constraints (e.g.,\nspeed, road constraints) and to deal efficiently with high level\nnonlinearities.\nThe behaviour of the MC filters is similar in both examples.\nBased on the above results we draw the following conclusions:\ni) The PF is sensitive to changes in the motion of the mobile\nunit. This sensitivity of the PF leads to higher peak-dynamic\nerrors during abrupt manoeuvres. In the presence of a sequence\nof abrupt manoeuvres a divergence of the PF is not excluded\nif it operates with a small number of particles. The probability\nof divergence could be reduced if a high number of particles is\nused which, however, increases the computational complexity.\nii) The RBPF exhibits better accuracy during the periods with\nabrupt changes. The \u2018measurements\u2019 at time instant k for the\nKalman filter in the RBPF represent the difference between\nthe estimated and predicted locations of the particles at time\ninstances k\u2212 1 and k, respectively. This is one of the reasons\nMIHAYLOVA et al.: MOBILITY TRACKING IN CELLULAR NETWORKS USING PARTICLE FILTERING 9\n \nFig. 11.

CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper has presented two sequential MC techniques\nfor mobility tracking, namely a particle filter and a Rao-\nBlackwellised particle filter. An assessment of their best\nachievable theoretical accuracy has been made. They have\nshown efficient mobility tracking in wireless networks over\nboth synthetic and real received signal strength measurements.\nThe designed filters are compared with the EKF technique\nand their enhanced performance with respect to the EKF is\ndemonstrated over scenarios with abrupt manoeuvres. Advan-\ntages of the RBPF compared with the PF are: i) decreased\ncomputational complexity because it exhibits similar accuracy\nwith smaller number of particles; ii) smaller peak-dynamic\nerrors during abrupt manoeuvres which is very important for\nthe practice. Posterior Crame\u00b4r-Rao lower bounds have been\ncalculated that characterise the lower limit for the average\nmean-square error of the state estimates.\n1.94 1.95 1.96 1.97 1.98 1.99 2\nx 10\n4\n1.97\n1.975\n1.98\n1.985\n1.99\n1.995\n2\n2.005\n2.01\nx 10\n4\nx coordinate, [m]\ny\n c\no\no\nrd\nin\nat\ne,\n [\nm\n]\n \n \ntrajectory\nEKF\nPF\nRBPF\nStart\nDestination\nFig. 13.
