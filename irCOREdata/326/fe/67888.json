Together, the writings and music provide complementary exam-\nples of  the characteristic tension between the pull of  tradition and the \nexhilarating opportunities of  Futurism in his work. \u0002  \nSuch tensions are present in Russolo\u2019s writings, which, due to the loss \nof  virtually all of  his music, form the foundation on which his reception \nhas been built. For the most part, this reception has followed Russolo\u2019s \nlead in stressing the progressive (often Futurist) elements that in practice \ninvolve the construction and use of  the noise instruments. Nevertheless, \nthe writings do not quite succeed in concealing the debts Russolo owes \nto certain traditional musical values, and the intermingling of  these \nwith his energetic prose reveals more of  his compositional approach \nthan he perhaps intended.\nPh\not\no:\n L\nui\ngi\n R\nus\nso\nlo\n 1  Flora Dennis, \u2018Luigi Russolo\u2019, The New Grove Dictionary of  Music and Musicians II ed.

These correspond-\nences throw into sharp relief  the blend of  progressive and traditional \nthought in Russolo\u2019s work, and provide a counterbalance to the image \nof  Russolo depicted in Brown\u2019s work. Comparing these two manifestos, \nwe can observe that each invoke a like-minded group of  artists, though \nin both only the author of  the manifesto is a signatory. Secondly, there \nis a strong whiff  of  the skin being sold before the bear is caught: both \nspeak primarily of  art that is to come, rather than describing art that is in \nexistence. Thirdly, and despite claims of  self-renewing originality based \non scientific discovery, the manifestos betray Futurism\u2019s links to the past \nwhilst simultaneously trying to kick over its traces.\nFor all of  Marinetti\u2019s self-aggrandizing and violent rhetoric of  \nrenewal, the Founding Manifesto is rooted in \u2018a tangled web of  turn-\nof-the-century political, cultural and philosophical currents\u2019.9 The \ninfluence of  writers such as Proudhon, Bakunin, Sorel and above \nall Nietzsche inform \u2013 often in an idiosyncratic and distorted fashion \n\u2013 both its prose style and content.10 Italian intellectuals such as Giovanni \nPapini, Giuseppe Prezzolini and Argendo Soffici criticised the Futurists \nfor their \u2018lack of  originality\u2019 \u2013 though one wonders if  this criticism was \nto some extent directed at Marinetti\u2019s lack either of  acknowledgement \nof  his sources or of  his recognition of  the similar themes articulated by \nhis peers.11\nOn the surface, and in contradistinction to Marinetti\u2019s grounding \nin the intellectual and artistic climate from which his own manifesto \nsprung, Luigi Russolo\u2019s manifesto \u2018The Art of  Noises\u2019 (1913), seemed \nto owe little to his background as a painter.12 It is likely that Marinetti\u2019s \nlinking of  technology, machinery and music in an insert into Balilla \nPratella\u2019s \u2018Technical Manifesto of  Futurist Music\u2019 (1911), along with \nMarinetti\u2019s example in general, stimulated Russolo\u2019s musical ideas.13 \nThe themes of  Futurist art that can be detected in Marinetti\u2019s manifesto \n 5  Barclay Brown, \u2018Introduction\u2019, The Art of  Noises trans.

Russolo claims that the music that was considered most successful \nwas that that is most unconventional; one wonders if  his claims of  \u2018knowing nothing\u2019 were \nsomewhat disingenuous, given his family background, cited in Brown, \u2018Introduction\u2019, p. 8.\n 13  See Brown, \u2018Introduction\u2019, pp. 2\u20133 and Payton pp. 31\u20132.\ntempo10\nrecur in Russolo\u2019s. Above all, one must place one\u2019s faith in the future, \nrather than the past. Instead of  the safety of  tradition, the Futurist is to \nplunge joyfully into the unknown, embracing the machine age, raising \nthe machine to the level of  an artistic object, glorifying speed and dyna-\nmism, exalting violence and conflict, and exploring the relationship of  \nall this to urban life. The goal is a mode of  expression \u2018flexible enough to \nexpress the range of  experience open to man in the dawning century of  \nspeed, mobility and unprecedented scientific advance\u2019.14\nThe realization of  this new form of  expression is a central theme \nof  Russolo\u2019s writings. His anticipation of  noise machines (the first of  \nwhich was ready a month after the publication of  the manifesto) genu-\ninely looks towards a musical future that only became commonplace \nfrom the 1940s with the advent of  musique concr\u00e8te. As with all Futurist \nmanifestos, the past is recognized for its glories, but for Russolo the con-\ncert hall is no longer to be a museum, nor the performer a curator: \nWe futurists have all deeply loved and enjoyed the harmonies of  the great \nmasters. Beethoven and Wagner have stirred our nerves and hearts for many \nyears. Now we have had enough of  them, and we delight much more in combining \nin our thoughts the noise of  trams, of  automobile engines, of  carriages and brawling \ncrowds, than in hearing again the \u201cEroica\u201d or the \u201cPastorale\u201d.15 \nThe expansion of  timbral resources \u2013 surely the most innovative aspect \nof  Russolo\u2019s work \u2013 is to be accompanied by an expansion of  pitch and \nrhythmic material: the octave is to be divided into quartertones (rather \nthan semitones), this division enabling \u2018dynamic continuity\u2019;16 rhyth-\nmic counterpoint is to take advantage of  the infinite \u2018rhythmic motions \nof  a noise\u2019.17 Russolo\u2019s vision of  music thus encompasses the scientific \nexploration of  sound, the depiction of  urban life, the possibilities of  the \nmachine age and the focus on dynamism that characterizes Futurist art \nin general. In this respect, his work is overtly progressive.\nMore traditional concerns inform the practicalities of  compos-\ning such music, which for Russolo was essentially abstract rather than \nimitative.18 Although many Futurists prized extreme subjectivity, such \nabstraction was by no means uncommon in their art. In paintings such \nas his \u2018Iridescent Interpretations\u2019, for example, the artist Giacomo Balla \ndrew on scientific analysis of  light;19 we might assume from this that \nRussolo was interested in a similar artistic response to the scientific \nproperties of  sound. He certainly provides sufficient observations about \nthe nature of  overtones in noise to suggest this is the case.20 On the other \nhand, Russolo also discussed certain organizational principles \u2013 indeed, \nhe was at pains to stress the \u2018logic\u2019 of  his music \u2013 that were of  a more \ntraditional nature, and which also might deserve the epithet abstract.21 \nWhen searching for further evidence that might help pin down what \nRussolo meant by \u2018abstraction\u2019, a useful point of  departure might be the \nobservation that Marinetti\u2019s liberation of  sounds from syntax and gram-\nmar was an inspiration for Russolo. A similar divorce of  sound from \n 14  Tisdall and Bozzolla, p. 7.\n 15  Luigi Russolo, \u2018The Art of  Noises: Futurist Manifesto\u2019, in The Art of  Noise, p. 25 (original \nemphasis).\n 16  Luigi Russolo, \u2018Enharmonic Notation\u2019, in The Art of  Noise, p. 68\n 17  Russolo, \u2018The Art of  Noises\u2019, p. 28.\n 18  See Brown, \u2018Introduction\u2019, pp. 2 and 13.\n 19  It should be noted that this attracted criticism from other Futurists such as Umberto \nBoccioni, who complained as early as 1907 that Balla\u2019s \u2018universe does not throb\u2019. (Cited in \nTisdall and Bozzolla, p. 62.)\n 20  See for instance, \u2018Physical Principles and Practical Possibilities\u2019, The Art of  Noises, pp. 37\u2013\n40. If  my inference is true, then we find Russolo once again through his scientific study of  \nsound anticipating subsequent 20th-century developments.\n 21  Russolo, \u2018Polemics, Battles, and the First Performances of  the Noise Instruments\u2019, The Art of  \nNoises, p. 31.\nrethinking russolo 11\nimitative associations in Russolo\u2019s music may well stem from Marinetti\u2019s \nexample, but this neither implies nor denies the existence of  a (musical) \ngrammar as an organizational principle.22 Russolo did not in fact discuss \nmusical syntax and grammar as such, save to suggest that noise might \nbe regulated by harmonic and rhythmic means, giving us justifiable \ngrounds for supposing that these elements were decisive in the shaping \nof  his music, and in particular the principle of  \u2018dynamic continuity\u2019.23 \nThat pitch is of  vital importance to his art is again apparent from a pas-\nsage in \u2018The Orchestra of  Noise Instruments\u2019, in which he discusses \naccuracy of  intonation in the same context as \u2018musicality\u2019,24 a somewhat \ntraditional concept and a possible signal that Russolo regards his work \non some level as being evolutionary rather than revolutionary. In this \nlight, we might view Russolo\u2019s \u2018emancipation of  timbre\u2019 in the same \nway as Schoenberg\u2019s \u2018emancipation of  dissonance\u2019, in that it renews, \nrather than replaces, the musical resources available to the composer.\nGiven the available evidence, the preceding comments and conclu-\nsions might need to be taken with a pinch of  salt. However, it is clear \nthat Russolo\u2019s desire for practicality in both the notation and per-\nformance of  his works meant that he blended old and new musical \nsymbols in his scores (such as the use of  the 5-line stave and traditional \ntime-signatures with certain graphical representations)25 along with \ntraditional terminology.26 A similar pragmatism informs the practice \nof  Futurist composers of  using the intonarumori alongside standard \norchestral instruments. Russolo notes that he added timpani, a sistrum \nand a xylophone to his orchestra of  noise instruments; Pratella com-\nbined conventional and unconventional instruments in his opera Eroe.27 \nNevertheless, here at least Russolo is clear that his preference is for his \nnew instruments on their own.28\nIt is impossible to be sure from the writings if  such compromises \nwere made in the spirit of  introducing gradually the novel aspects of  \nFuturist music, as Russolo would have us believe, or if  they were indica-\ntive of  a compositional aesthetic less radical than one might otherwise \nhave thought.29 Nevertheless, the fact that such compromises exist at all \nshould alert us to the possibility that Russolo\u2019s compositions may also \nhave displayed an underlying pragmatism, if  not conservatism, that \nserved to organize (or even constrain) the musical material. \u0002  \nAlthough it is dangerous to assume that there is necessarily a unity \nbetween a composer\u2019s aesthetic writings and compositional out-\nput, there is evidence in the first seven bars of  Il risveglio that Russolo \n 22  In a similar manner, the absence of  traditional instruments removes particular expressive \nand associative connotations. Alexander Goehr noted how for the Futurists \u2018flutes or ket-\ntle drums themselves symbolise a culture\u2019, and \u2018traditional instruments were remnants of  \nan ancient civilisation which had to be destroyed\u2019. In this respect, the Futurists provided \nan example for Stravinsky and Var\u00e8se. See \u2018The Survival of  the Symphony. 4. Licence for \nLicence\u2019, The Listener (10 December 1987): p. 18. With little supporting evidence from \nRussolo\u2019s writings, Brown suggests in his \u2018Introduction\u2019 (p. 19) with reference to a review of  \nIl risveglio in the Pall Mall Gazette, that there may well be some formal principles underpin-\nning the music.\n 23  In \u2018The Art of  Noises: Futurist Manifesto\u2019, p. 27.\n 24  The Art of  Noises, p. 81.\n 25  See \u2018Enharmonic Notation\u2019, p. 67\u20138.\n 26  The use of  the word \u2018theme\u2019 in the article \u2018The Orchestra of  Noise Instruments\u2019 may have \nbeen metaphorical, but it may also have signalled that traditional musical methods of  con-\nstruction inform Russolo\u2019s practice, p. 82. \n 27  Russolo, \u2018The Orchestra of  Noise Instruments\u2019, p. 82.\n 28  Ibid.\n 29  One might note a similar compromise in the first wave of  Futurist painting, which relied on \nrecent trends (Divisionism and Cubism) for its technical basis.\ntempo12\npractised what he preached. That is to say, these bars provide further \nconfirmation that Russolo is less of  a revolutionary than might be imag-\nined, and this consistency enables the music to be admitted as evidence \nwhen considering Russolo\u2019s output as a whole.\nBefore turning to what we know of  Russolo\u2019s music, what of  the \nmusic that has not survived? Brown omits from his account the direct \ncontact Russolo\u2019s contemporaries had with both the noise instruments \nand the music written for them.30 Stravinsky had met Russolo and heard \nhis music on a trip to Milan in 1915; also present on this occasion were \nDiaghilev and Prokofiev.31 Six years later, three Futurist concerts in Paris \nwere to have \u2018a considerable impact [\u2026] on Casella, Falla, Honegger, \nMilhaud, Ravel and Stravinsky\u2019,32 and a 1929 demonstration of  the \nrumorarmonio was introduced by Var\u00e8se. Accounts of  the 1915 event \nsuggest that, at best, the potential of  the instruments was recognized, \nbut their current state of  development, and the music that was written \nfor them, was considered less impressive.33 \nExample One presents the surviving bars, transcribed into standard \nnotation. (At the start of  each system are the ranges of  each instrument \nas given by Russolo, who claims that these were the ranges employed in \nperformances of  Il risvelgio.)34 Barclay Brown has described these bars as \nfollows: \nThese two pages display the constant use of  drones and glissandos. Although the \nindividual entrances of  the instruments and the presence of  contrary motion in \nthe parts give the impression of  polyphony, the music has a clearly harmonic \nintent. The first of  the two pages seems to be loosely based on a chord interval-\nlically constructed like a dominant seventh with the root of  G.35 \nAll but the last of  these features can be discerned in Ex. 1. The pedal \npoints provided by the ronzatori (low hummer) suggest i\u2013V\u2013VI in E \nminor, though in practice the language is more ambiguous than that. \nThe opening leans first towards an enharmonically-spelt dominant \nseventh on C-natural and then to a half-diminished chord on C-sharp. \nBars three and four combine a sustained perfect fifth on B with mov-\ning material that affirms E as a tonic. The extract ends with a sustained \naugmented chord on C, first anticipated in passing in bar 1. The use of  \nquarter-tones at the very end, in a sort of  written out glissando, falls \nfar short of  the brave new world of  pitch resources described by the \ncomposer.36 Rhythmically, the passage is far more straightforward. The \npedal points establish a regular harmonic rhythm; motion above this \nconforms to a regular simple triple metre. This is true also for the glis-\nsandi that are initiated in the second bar and which become increasingly \nimportant as the extract progresses: the crotchet pulse regulates the \nbeginnings, endings, peaks and troughs of  all of  the glissandi. \n 30  Such omissions are characteristic of  Brown\u2019s Introduction: see John C.

However, as can be seen in Ex. 1, \nthere are numerous instances of  the work going beyond the notional limits of  the instru-\nments. This fragment was recorded in 1977 using reconstructions of  Russolo\u2019s instruments. \nThe recording itself  is but 30 seconds long; there are also demonstrations of  each of  the \ninstruments. Some issues of  the recording distinguish between the work and the samples of  \nthe intonarumori (for instance, Musica Futurista: The Art of  Noises ); others, such as Futurism \nand Dada Reviewed (LTMCD 01) run all the tracks together, creating a misleading impression \nof  the work and its content.\n 35  Barclay Brown, \u2018The Noise Instruments of  Luigi Russolo\u2019, Perspectives of  New Music Vol. 20, \nNo. 1\/2 (Autumn, 1981 \u2013 Summer, 1982), 36.\n 36  \u2018The Conquest of  Enharmonicism\u2019, The Art of  Noises, pp. 61\u201366.\nrethinking russolo 13\nIf  pitch and rhythm provide the logic underpinning Russolo\u2019s music, \nwhat organizational principles might we infer from this passage? The \nharmonic language as notated, considered independently from timbre, \nshows an awareness of  contemporary developments in the field, balanc-\ning impressionistic sonorities with weakly-directed tonal motion. This \ntonal motion, coupled with the regularity of  harmonic rhythm and Example 1\ntempo14\nmeasured crotchet pulse, provides a solid, if  routine framework. Giving \nRussolo the benefit of  the doubt, one might assume that this framework \nwas yet another pragmatic device, one that gave musicians unused to \nthe intonarumori something familiar to work with. It is likely, however, \ndespite Russolo\u2019s claim that the noise instruments have amongst the Example 1 continued\nrethinking russolo 15\nnumerous overtones a clearly defined primary pitch,37 that the result-\ning harmonies would have been inaudible, and any notional pragmatic \nfunction that they may have had would have been lost. Certainly, none \nof  the accounts of  Russolo\u2019s concerts discuss the harmonic language, \nand nor can it be heard in reconstructions of  these bars.38 \nAs with Russolo\u2019s relatively simplistic approach to harmony, his use \nof  the intonarumori lacks a deft touch. The impression is that the com-\nposer is over-eager to show off  his creations. Within the first six bars, \nhe deploys all of  his available resources: all but one of  the instruments \ncontributes to the tutti in bar 5, and only the ronzatori do not make \nuse of  their ability to glissando. Clearly, the city is waking quickly! \nUnfortunately, it is likely that the rush to incorporate everything would \nrender indistinct the timbral variety at his disposal. \n A similar argument regarding the inaudibility of  rhythms can be \nmade, for the noise machines set up their own internal rhythms.39 In this \nrespect, the timbre of  the noise instruments serves to mask the musi-\ncally unadventurous material in much the same way the Futurists such \nas Marinetti and Russolo cover their own aesthetic debts to the past in \ntheir otherwise progressive writings. \nThe degree to which these debts are covered can be discerned in \nMark Radice\u2019s analysis of  these bars. Although he doesn\u2019t use the term \n\u2018dynamic continuity\u2019 in this context, Radice\u2019s sympathetic reading of  the \nwork suggests how Russolo\u2019s expressive goal might have been realized: \nIn traditional Western art music, vertical sonorities are arranged as a progres-\nsion of  chords consisting of  identifiable intervals invariably based upon the \npresumption that the half  step in some way represents the smallest, indivis-\nible sub-atomic particle. Russolo\u2019s conception of  Futurist music eliminates \nsuch \u201cprogressions\u201d and substitutes instead a continuous \u201ctransformation\u201d of  \nvertical sonorities. \n[\u2026]\nRussolo\u2019s new notation does indeed facilitate correspondingly new musical ideas, \nparticularly insofar as transformations of  vertical sonorities are shown in what \nwe might call analogue fashion. Since Russolo\u2019s time, important compositions \nemploying transformations rather than progressions have appeared \u2013 Bart\u00f3k\u2019s \nMusic for String Instruments, Percussion and Celesta (1936) and Penderecki\u2019s \nThrenody for the Victims of  Hiroshima (1960) are two well-known examples. [\u2026] \nUnfortunately, music theory has not kept pace with musical practice, and, as yet, \nthere is no system for discussing vertical sonorities incorporating microtones.40 \n As I have shown, the musical language is not as unorthodox as Radice \nwould have us believe; the glissandi and microtones are essentially sur-\nface decorations and the transformations of  vertical sonorities owe as \nmuch to late-Romantic parsimonious voice-leading as it does to proto-\nBart\u00f3kian principles (note, for example, the chromatic shifts in bars 1 \nand 2; the augmented chord on C is formed by raising the third and fifth \nof  the \u2018tonic\u2019 E minor chord). At this early stage of  its development, \ndynamic continuity seems to have fallen far short of  the Futurist aims \nof  \u2018speed, mobility and unprecedented scientific advance\u2019. The reasons \nfor this, I contend, are twofold. Firstly, Russolo\u2019s reliance on traditional \nstructuring principles, whether for pragmatic purposes or not, serves \nto inhibit the musical flow; nor do these principles provide an alterna-\ntive means of  realizing a new form of  musical expression. Secondly, \nRussolo\u2019s use of  traditional devices leaves him open to traditional criti-\ncism, and these bars would suggest that he is not a particularly inspired \ncomposer (hardly a surprising conclusion, given his background).\n 37  \u2018The Art of  Noises: Futurist Manifesto\u2019, p. 27.\n 38  See n. 34. \n 39  \u2018The Art of  Noises: Futurist Manifesto\u2019, p. 28.\n 40  Mark A.

Furthermore, by basing both his notation and his organi-\nzational principles on traditional models, he makes the learning process \neasier for performers schooled in such models. However, the traditional \nbasis of  these bars should also serve to limit readings of  his work that \noveremphasize the progressive aspects. Indeed, throughout his sur-\nviving literary output, and exemplified by Il risveglio, we find Russolo \nbuilding on the past, rather than sweeping it aside with the new as \nthe Founding Manifesto of  Futurism confidently proclaims should be \nthe model. \nNevertheless, if  one is to attempt an evaluation of  Russolo\u2019s musical \ncareer, then these few bars, rescued and reconstituted by musico-archae-\nology, become significant. Russolo\u2019s reception has seldom been based \non a close reading of  his music, and doing so provides interesting par-\nallels with his theoretical and mechanical work, whilst highlighting \ncertain musical weaknesses which compromise his endeavours. In this \nlight, Flora Dennis\u2019s suggestion that Russolo was an inventor first and \ncomposer third has more than a ring of  truth about it; Russolo\u2019s relega-\ntion to an interesting footnote in music history is perhaps deserved. \nbibliography\nBalla, Giacomo; Carr\u00e0, Carlo; Marinetti, Filippo Tommaso, Russolo, \nLuigi; Severini, Gino, The Technical Manifesto of  Futurist Painting, \n1910.\nBrown, Barclay, \u2018The Noise Instruments of  Luigi Russolo\u2019, Perspectives \nof  New Music Vol. 20, No. 1\/2 (Autumn, 1981 \u2013 Summer, 1982), \npp. 31\u201348.\nBurton, Anthony, \u2018Luigi Russolo\u2019 in The Oxford Companion to Music ed. \nAlison Latham (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, \n2002), pp. 1093\u2013 4.\nDennis, Flora, \u2018Luigi Russolo\u2019 in The New Grove Dictionary of  Music \nand Musicians 2nd edition., Vol. 22 ed.
