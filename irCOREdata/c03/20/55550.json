However, this must be achieved\nwithout excessive deformation that would damage\nthe sensitive living structures of the hoof 3. Unlike\nbone, equine hoof wall has only limited capacity for\nrepair; damaged material can only be replenished by\nnew hoof after it has worn off distally. It is important\nthat the material and structure withstand these forces\nbecause lameness in the horse can result from\nbreakdown in the integrity of the hoof wall material\nand resulting infection.\nDuring the support phase of stance the hoof capsule\ndeforms, providing a major role in dissipating concus-\nsive forces4. The hoof wall is an obliquely truncated\ncone that opens posteriorly between the heels when\nthe hoof contacts the ground and, during the stance\nphase of locomotion, the dorsal wall of the hoof\ncurves inwards (dorsoconcavity), resulting from longi-\ntudinal compressive forces directed parallel to the\nhoof wall, and the heels expand5. The expansion of\nthe heels produces horizontally directed compressive\nforces in the dorsal surface of the toe and loads\nthe internal wall in tension6,7. The dorsal wall of\nthe hoof is effectively flexed inwards, under\nsufficient loading, and the heels flex outwards during\nexpansion.\nThe hoof is a complex structure and the material\nvaries in relation to the anatomy of the hoof wall.\n\u2020Present address: Writtle College, Lordships Road, Chelmsford,\nEssex, CM1 3RR, UK\nComparative Exercise Physiology 5(3-4); 161\u2013168 doi:10.1017\/S1478061509356157\nqCambridge University Press 2009\nThe hoof wall is made up of three layers: the stratum\nexternum, a thin covering thought to inhibit\ndehydration; the stratum medium, serving a primary\nmechanical role and the stratum internum, that is\nresponsible for transferring loads to the bony\nskeleton8. The stratum medium, which is the thickest\nlayer, is composed of keratin cells that are organised\ninto two distinct patterns: tubular structures, where\nthe cells\u2019 axis lies parallel to the dorsal wall and\nintertubular material consisting of sheets running\nparallel to the load-bearing surface of the hoof 9.\nThe mechanical properties of biological materials\nare highly dependent on the water content: a lower\nwater content is associated with a stiffer material10,11.\nThe mechanical properties of keratinous materials\nare also strongly influenced by their hydration\nstatus9,12\u201315. Two main hydration gradients have been\nreported in the equine hoof wall: a horizontal gradient\nwhere the outer surface has low levels and the inner,\nadjacent to the dermis, which maintains higher\nhydration levels and a vertical gradient where the\nhydration status increases from the distal surface to\nthe proximal germinative regions9. Variation in the\nhydration status of the hoof wall is thought to be\nresponsible for a stiffness gradient from the inner\nwall to the dorsal hoof wall9,16.\nPrevious work has established the basic material\nproperties of the hoof wall in compression and tension\nand some effects of hydration. The present work adds\nto that foundation by testing the wall in a manner that\nis close to the deformation in vivo. This study aims to\ndetermine whether the flexural properties and water\ncontent of the hoof wall vary in different locations\naround the hoof capsule by testing beams machined\nfrom the hoof wall around the whole hoof capsule.\nWe hypothesise that there will be variation in the\nflexural properties around the hoof wall in different\nlocations around the hoof capsule and that samples\ntaken from the toe region will have a higher yield\nstrength and be composed of a stiffer material than\nthose from the heel region.\nMaterials and methods\nSpecimen preparation\nFive normal equine cadaver lower limbs were\ncollected from the local slaughterhouse (GW Lord and\nSons, Gainsborough, UK). Animals were destroyed for\nreasons other than this study and feet were\nconsidered normal where no visible signs of cracks,\nabscesses, laminitis or gross foot imbalanceswere appar-\nent. A mixture of three fore- and two hind-limbs were\nused and the animals were unshod at death. Lower\nlimbs were sealed in plastic bags and placed in a freezer\nat 2218C. After 5 days, hooves were removed from the\nlower limb and cuts into toe, quarter and heel regions\nwere made using a band saw (Fig. 1a).\nEach hoof region was then carefully cut into uniform\nbeams using a band saw and sanded to a uniform\nthickness using a sanding wheel (Dremel Multi-Model\n395, S-B Power Tool Co., New Bern, NC, USA). Beams\nwere 40mm in length with a mean width of\n3.6 ^ 0.66mm (SD) and height of 3.7 ^ 0.66mm (SD).\nIn order to investigate mechanical anisotropy of the\nhoof wall, beams were cut both perpendicular and par-\nallel to the axis of the tubules and termed transverse\nand longitudinal beams, respectively (Fig. 1b). Material\nwas only taken from the outer stratum medium as\ndefined by Wagner et al.17 and beams were cut from\nthe pigmented outer zone the hoof wall consisting of\nonly the first 4mm of the material closest to the outer\nsurface of the hoof capsule. This ensured that none of\nthe stratum internum (identified by visual inspection\nof the position of the laminar junction) was included\nin the test samples. In order to limit the effects of\nbeam preparation on the in vivo structural arrangement\nof the outer hoof wall, some transverse samples\nFIG. 1 (a) Distal surface (solar view) of the hoof capsule,\nindicating hoof regions and (b) the hoof wall to show orientation of\nthe beams relative to the tubules. Transverse beams (---) were\ncut perpendicular and longitudinal beams (\u2014) were cut parallel to\nthe proximo-distal orientation of the tubules (\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7)\nAM Goodman and L Haggis162\nexhibited a small degree of natural curvature. It was felt\nthat this would not have a significant effect on the\nresults. Furthermore, to prevent the damaged distal\nsurface of the hoof wall biasing the results, the distal\n4mm where the hoof contacted the ground, was dis-\ncarded. Since the palmar aspect of the hoof wall is\nshorter than the dorsal, it was impossible to cut both\nlongitudinal and transverse beams of sufficient length\nfrom the same heel region of each foot. Therefore,\ntransverse and longitudinal samples were taken from\nopposing regions of the hoof; this was alternated\nbetween hooves and data from the medial and lateral\nsamples were pooled. Material from the hoof wall in\nthe toe region was machined into up to four transverse\nand eight longitudinal beams. To maximise the length\nof beams, the transverse samples were taken from the\nmost distal region of the hoof wall.\nSamples were thawed at room temperature for 24 h,\nimmediately wrapped in damp tissue, placed in sealed,\nplastic sample bags and stored at 48C. The water\ncontent of the beams was determined immediately\nafter mechanical testing by measuring mass loss of\noven-dried specimens (808C, 5 days); water content\nwas calculated per unit fresh weight.\nMechanical tests\nThree-point bending tests (Fig. 2) were performed on\neach beam cut from the hoof wall using a universal\ntesting machine (Instron, model 4443). Beams were\nmaintained at in vivo moisture content before testing\nby wrapping in damp tissue and the dimensions\nwere measured at the mid-point using a digital\nmicrometer (Mitutoyo, Japan). The sample was\nplaced between two supports that were spaced at no\nless than ten times the mid-point depth of the\nsample to avoid problems with shear18. The two sup-\nports were 40mm apart with the stratum externum\nfacing uppermost. A pushing probe of radius 5mm\nwas lowered at a rate of 30mmmin21 (strain rate of\n,6.9 \u00a3 1023 s21), causing the sample to bend until it\neventually yielded. This was within the range of\nphysiological strain rates described by Kasapi and\nGosline19. For longitudinal beams, the force acted\nperpendicular to the tubular axis in the circumferential\nplane, and for transverse beams the force acted parallel\nto the tubular axis in the radial plane.\nAn interfaced computer was used to produce a\ngraph of applied force versus displacement, permitting\ncalculation of the mechanical properties of the sample.\nAnalysis of bending tests\nThe bending yield strength, S [equation (1)] and\nbending modulus E [equation (2)], of the material of\nwhich they were composed, were calculated using\nwell-known equations20. The yield strength in\nbending, S, is given by the following expression:\nYield strength bending \u00bc 3 Fyield L=2bh2 \u00f01\u00de\nwhere Fyield is an estimate of the point at which the hoof\nwall starts to yield, L is the distance between the\nsupports and b and h are the width and height, respect-\nively, of the beam\u2019s cross-section in metres. The yield\npoint was estimated using a stiffness reduction\ntechnique; the initial linear slope of the original force\nversus displacement curvewas reduced by 10%, plotted\nand the intersection with the force versus\ndisplacement curve defined the yield point17 (Fig. 3).\nThe bending modulus, E, is given by\nBendingmodulus \u00bc L3\u00f0dF=dd\u00de=4bh3; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere dF\/dd is the initial slope of the force versus\ndisplacement curve. A high modulus indicates a stiffer\nmaterial.\nFIG. 2 Three-point bending test.

The water content data were normalised\nusing an arcsine square root transformation before\nanalysis. Significant (P , 0.05) changes in the mechan-\nical properties and transformed water content data\nbetween the regions were further investigated by\nusing a Tukey\u2013Kramer multiple comparison test21.\nIn order to investigate anisotropic behaviour of the\nhoof wall, paired Student\u2019s t-tests were used to test\nfor significant differences in the bending modulus\nand yield strength of longitudinally and transversely\norientated beams. Regression analysis was used to\ninvestigate the relationship between the bending\nmodulus and the water content of the beams. Unless\notherwise stated, all values in the text are means ^ SE.\nResults\nMechanical behaviour\nA typical force versus displacement plot for the hoof wall\nis shown inFig. 3; hoofwall samplesproducedacharacter-\nistic biphasic force versus displacement curve. Therewas\nan initial linear elastic relationship between force and\ndisplacement followed by a plateau as thematerial started\nto yield. The bending modulus (mean ^ SD) of the hoof\nwall material in transverse beams was: toe 380 ^ 61.6\nMPa; quarters 309 ^ 42.2MPa and heel 210 ^ 52.2MPa;\nand in longitudinal beams: toe 338 ^ 26.2MPa; quarters\n361 ^ 52.8MPa and heel 265 ^ 37.3MPa. The bending\nyield strength (mean ^ SD) of transverse beams was:\ntoe 10.8 ^ 1.81MPa; quarters 10.1^ 2.63MPa and\nheel 7.8^ 0.96MPa; and of longitudinal beams: toe\n10.0^ 0.48MPa; quarters 10.8^ 1.36MPa and heel\n7.9^ 1.07MPa. The water content (mean^ SD) of\ntransverse beams was: toe 24.2 ^ 0.98%; quarters\n25.1^ 0.56% and heel 28.2 ^ 1.34%; and of longitudinal\nbeamswas: toe 30.5^ 4.27%; quarters 27.5 ^ 1.67% and\nheel 29.9 ^ 1.82%.\nSite variation around the hoof capsule\nThere were significant differences in the mechanical\nproperties of the wall material around the hoof\ncapsule; beams taken from heels were significantly\nmore compliant and weaker than those taken from the\ntoe andquarter regions (Fig. 4aand4b;Table1).However,\nthere were subtle, but significant regional differences in\ntheproperties of beamsbetween those cut perpendicular\nand parallel to the tubular axis. Transverse beams cut\nfrom the heels of the hoof wall were more compliant,\naround 45%, but not significantly weaker (P \u00bc 0.076;\nn \u00bc 5) than those cut from the toe and quarter regions,\nwhereas longitudinal beams in the heel region were\naround 22% more compliant and 21% weaker than\nthose from the toe (P , 0.01; Table 1; Fig. 4a and 4b).\nDifferences in properties corresponded with\nsignificant differences in the water content of the hoof\nwall between regions; transverse beams taken from\nthe heels were significantly more hydrated than those\nfrom the toe and quarters (Fig. 5; P , 0.01). The water\ncontent of transverse beams from the heel region was\nTable 1 Results of Tukey\u2013Kramer multiple comparison tests\nshowing regional differences in the properties of the hoof wall\nbetween the toe (T), quarters (Q) and heels (H), and paired\nStudent\u2019s t-tests showing differences between transverse (Tr) and\nlongitudinal (L) beams\nTukey\u2013Kramer multiple comparison tests\nProperties\/orientation Transverse Longitudinal\nBending modulus (MPa) H , T Qa H , TQa\nBending yield strength (MPa) NS H , TQa\nWater content (%) H .

However, in\ncontrast to transverse beams, longitudinal beams\nshowed no significant differences in their water content\nbetween the regions (Fig. 5; P . 0.05).\nBeam orientation and anisotropic behaviour\nThere were significant differences between the stiffness\nand the water content of beams cut parallel and perpen-\ndicular to the tubular axis. Paired Student\u2019s t-tests\nshowed that the hoof wall was anisotropic; longitudinal\nbeams in the quarters were 17% stiffer than transverse\nbeams (Table 1; Fig. 4a; P , 0.05). However, there\nwere no significant differences between the stiffness\nof longitudinal and transverse beams in the toe or\nheels (Table 1; Fig. 4a; P . 0.05). There were also\nsignificant differences in the water content between\nbeams cut parallel and those cut perpendicular to the\ntubular axis; longitudinal beams from the toe region\nwere 26% more hydrated than transverse beams taken\nfrom the same region (Fig. 5; Table 1; P , 0.05).\nRelationship between flexural properties and\nwater content\nRegression analysis showed that the bending modulus\ndecreased significantly with an increase in water con-\ntent (t13 \u00bc 25.38, P , 0.001, r 2 \u00bc 69.0%); transverse\nbeams with a higher water content were more compli-\nant (Fig. 6a). The line of best fit is given by the equation:\nBendingmodulus \u00f0MPa\u00de \u00bc 12272 \u00bd35:9\n\u00a3water content \u00f0%\u00de\u0001:\nHowever, for longitudinal beams, there was no signifi-\ncant relationship between the water content and the\nbending modulus (Fig. 6b, t13 \u00bc 20.55, P . 0.05,\nr 2 \u00bc 2.3%).\nDiscussion\nThis study shows that there is significant regional\nvariation in the flexural properties of the hoof wall;\nbeams taken from the heel were significantly more\ncompliant than those taken from the toe and the quar-\nter regions. This is important because previous studies\nhave shown that when the hoof contacts the ground\nduring locomotion, the hoof capsule deforms during\nthe support phase of stance to dissipate concussive\nforces. During the stance phase of locomotion, the\ndorsal wall of the hoof curves inwards (dorsoconcav-\nity), resulting from longitudinal compressive forces\ndirected parallel to the hoof wall, and the heels\nexpand5. It is not surprising that beams taken from\nthe heel region were more flexible, as this would facili-\ntate the outward flexing of the heels during the expan-\nsion of the hoof capsule. This is supported by previous\nwork where samples from the medial and lateral\nregions were more compliant, in both tension and\ncompression, than those from the dorsal region22.\nExperiments using photoelastic stress analysis to\ninvestigate the relative position of strain field epicen-\ntres around the hoof capsule also showed that\nthe majority of strain field epicentres were evenly\nFIG. 5 Variation in the water content of transverse and\nlongitudinal beams taken from the hoof wall around the capsule:\nthe toe (T), quarters (Q) and heel (H) regions.

Vertical bars indicate ^SE\nFIG. 6 Relationship between the water content and bending\nmodulus of (a) transverse and (b) longitudinal samples taken from\nthe hoof wall. There was a significant negative association\nbetween the water content and the stiffness of transverse\nsamples; the bending modulus decreased significantly with an\nincrease in water content (t13 \u00bc 25.38, P , 0.001, r 2 \u00bc 69.0%)\nVariation in equine hoof wall properties 165\ndistributed on both sides of the hoof from the heel to\nthe junction of the quarters and toe region; relatively\nfew epicentres were recorded in the toe region23.\nVariation in the mechanical properties around the\nhoof capsule and anisotropy might be explained by\ntwo possible factors: first, the structure of the hoof\nwall or, secondly, variation in the chemical nature of\nkeratin. First, differences in the morphology and ultra-\nstructure of the wall material are likely to affect its\nmechanical properties around the hoof capsule.\nThe hoof wall is made of keratin, a fibre-reinforced\ncomposite material composed of a-keratin intermedi-\nate filaments embedded in a viscoelastic protein\nmatrix, and the intermediate filaments are composed\nof protofibrils that associate helically in super\ncoils12,24. This in turn is organised into cylindrical\nstructures, called tubules, which are orientated\nlongitudinally, parallel to the hoof wall. It may be\nthat variation in the ultrastructure \u2013 i.e. orientation\nof the intertubular intermediate filaments around the\nhoof capsule \u2013 is responsible, at least in part, for the\ncircumferential variation in mechanical properties\nand anisotropic behaviour. In this study, there was\nevidence of mechanical anisotropy with significant\ndifferences between the mechanical properties of\nsamples relative to the orientation of the tubules.\nLongitudinal beams from the quarters were 17% stiffer\nthan transverse beams (Fig. 4a; Table 1; P , 0.05).\nThis is likely to result from the structural organisation\nof the hoof wall material. Previous work on the\nultrastructure and mechanical properties of the hoof\nwall in the toe region showed that the orientation of\nthe intertubular intermediate filaments varied between\nthe layers of the hoof wall; the plane of intermediate\nfilaments changes from perpendicular to the tubule\naxis, in the inner layer, to parallel in the outer\nlayer25. This prevented the propagation of cracks and\nwould also be an important factor in anisotropic beha-\nviour of the hoof wall.\nThe significance of tubule density on the mechanical\nproperties of the equine hoof has previously been\nsuggested by Leach and Zoerb3 and investigated by\nKasapi and Gosline26. A radial increase in tubule\ndensity from the inner to the outer surface of the hoof\nwall has been shown to correspond to the increasing\nstiffness gradient observed from the inner to outer\nsurface of the hoof wall25,27. Furthermore, tubule mor-\nphology and orientation has been shown to be related\nto the direction of loading; tubules in the outer layer of\nthe equine hoof wall are elliptical in cross-section and\nthe main axis is oriented circumferentially, whereas\nthose in the inner layers are circular in cross-section.\nThe elliptical tubules would appear to be optimised to\nminimise the effects of lateral compressive stress3.\nSecondly, it is possible that circumferential variation\nin physical properties is determined at the molecular\nlevel. In hard keratins, cysteine\u2013cysteine disulphide\ncross-links stabilise the microfibrils and cysteine-rich\nproteins of the matrix12. The rest of the matrix has\nfew covalent cross-links and its stabilisation is depend-\nent on weaker hydrogen bonds that are hydration\ndependent9. Just as an increase in the quantity of\nnon-cysteine protein may decrease keratin stiffness\n(in the presence of water), so an increase in cysteine\nresidues and the resultant disulphide bonds with\nwhich they are associated could increase flexural\nstiffness and strength. A greater proportion of the\nstronger disulphide bonds within the protein matrix\nthat cements the hoof together could increase both\nthe stiffness and the strength of the hoof capsule.\nThus, regional variation in the composition of the\nprotein matrix that cements the keratin fibres of the\nhoof together could be an important factor in\ndetermining its mechanical properties.\nNot surprisingly, variation in the flexural properties\naround the hoof capsule corresponded with variation\nin the water content; transverse samples from the\nheel region, which were more compliant, were also\nmore hydrated than those from the toe region.\nRegression analysis of the relationship between the\nwater content and the stiffness supports this; in trans-\nverse samples, there was a significant negative\nassociation between the water content and the\nstiffness of the samples (Fig. 6a). Similarly, longitudinal\nbeams cut from the hoof wall in the heel region\nwere also more compliant and weaker than those\nfrom the toe; however, variation in the stiffness of\nthe longitudinal beams could not be accounted for\nby variation in water content; there was no significant\nrelationship between the water content and the stiff-\nness of the material (Fig. 6b). This may be due to\nincreased variation in the properties of longitudinal\nsamples resulting from a proximo\u2013distal water\ngradient2. In addition, longitudinal beams from the\ntoe region were significantly more hydrated than\ntransverse beams taken from the same region. It is\npossible that this was a result of the increased\nnumber of exposed tubule cross-sections in the\ntransverse samples26 or the combined effects of the\nsampling regime and presence of a proximo\u2013distal\nwater gradient in the hoof wall2. However, the water\ncontent of hoof wall samples in this study of\n27.5 ^ 0.3% was similar to values recorded by\nothers: Butler and Hintz28 of 27.8% and Douglas\net al.22 of 27.9%. Furthermore, hoof wall material\nshowed typical force versus displacement behaviour\npreviously described in the equine hoof1,29.\nWhatever the causal mechanisms for the regional\ndifferences found in this study, it may be concluded\nthat the results support the concept that the material\nproperties are linked to known patterns of deform-\nation in the hoof wall. The presence of an increasing\nAM Goodman and L Haggis166\ngradient of stiffness circumferentially from the heels to\nthe toe region may perform a damping function,\nsmoothing the transfer of energy between areas of\nhigh and low deformation (strain). As the foot usually\ncomes to the ground heel first, the significant and\nrapid expansion of the heels would be resisted by\nthe progressively stiffer material of the quarter and\ntoe regions.\nFurthermore, if one considers the break-over of the\nfoot where the dorsal wall is subjected to the resist-\nance of the ground surface, excessive longitudinal\nflexion of the dorsal hoof wall not only reduces\nthe efficiency of locomotion but could result in\nexcessive forces concentrated in the distal portion\nof the laminar junction. A stiffer dorsal hoof wall\nwould help prevent such a localised stress concen-\ntration and hence reduce the risk of peeling the\nhoof wall from the phalanx, much like bending\nback a fingernail.\nThis study supports the hypothesis that there is\nsignificant circumferential variation in the mechanical\nproperties and water content of the hoof wall. Patterns\nof variation are in accord with previous work on the\ndeformations experienced by each region of the wall\nunder load. It is important that future work determines\nwhether the ultrastructure and biochemical compos-\nition of the hoof wall also varies around the hoof\ncapsule.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Gary Millar and Amanda Mylett for technical\nsupport and the referees for their constructive\ncomments.\nReferences\n1 Zoerb GC and Leach DH (1978).
