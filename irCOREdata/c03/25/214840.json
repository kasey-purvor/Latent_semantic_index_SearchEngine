Research with homelessness professionals (HPs) working in the UK voluntary \nsector shows that expert definitions of homelessness can either undermine or enhance the health of \nthe homeless. Guided by the concepts of social representations and cognitive polyphasia, the \nanalysis reveals a contradictory field of knowledge, which reflects the struggle of professionals to \nsustain a humanizing approach and resist the pressures of statutory agendas. We conclude pointing \nto the need of recognising the impact of professional\u2019s knowledge on the health and care policies \nfor the homeless.  \n \nKeywords: homelessness, expert knowledge, social representations, cognitive polyphasia, identity. \n \n 3 \nINTRODUCTION \n \nHomelessness continues to be a major social problem in the UK. Despite the great deal of attention \nit received since the mid-1990s from policy makers, researchers and service providers, there \nremains much controversy about the extent of the problem, its underlying causes, and the most \neffective ways to combat it. These controversies stem partly from the fact that in the UK there is \nwidespread disagreement on the definition of homelessness. Whereas the homeless have been \nunanimously identified as a socially excluded group and various policies, such as the Homelessness \nDirectorate and the Rough Sleepers Unit, have been implemented to address the issue (Pleace & \nQuilgars, 2003), support and care structures are diversified across two clashing and co-existing \nsectors: the voluntary and the statutory sectors, each holding different definitions and approaches to \nthe problem of the homeless.  \n \nThis general lack of agreement between sectors on defining homelessness creates a number of \nproblems ranging from difficulties in estimating precisely the number of homeless people in the UK \nto consequences at the level of service delivery, models of intervention and policy design. While \ngovernmental estimations reflect a decline in numbers (see ODPM, 2006), sources from the \nvoluntary sector show that there is a vast number of homeless people that are not included in these \nstatistics (Crisis, 2006) because they are not officially considered homeless. The contested nature of \ndefinitions about homelessness makes it difficult to achieve consensual estimations (Hutson & \nLiddiard, 1994) and impacts negatively on the health and needs of those who do not fit within \nstatutory definitions and are thus not officially regarded as homeless (e.g. Crane & Warnes, 2001).  \n \nWhereas it is clear that, as with most social problems, homelessness is constructed through \nnetworks of unstable and contested meanings, tackling the problem effectively requires a clear \nunderstanding of how the issue is framed by different stakeholders and social actors. Care-related \n 4 \npractices, the interventions deemed appropriate to prevent and resolve homelessness, and how the \nhomeless are treated are all based on meanings and definitions of homelessness. As Pleace and \nQuilgars (2003) concluded in their examination of British homeless research, there is an urgent \nneed for academics of the social sciences to explore the socially constructed nature of homelessness \nin the UK . \n \nIn this paper we seek to contribute in this direction by examining social psychological dimensions \ninvolved in the constitution of homelessness and the role they play in the living conditions and thus \nhealth of the homeless. We focus on the links between expert knowledge and health, and in \nparticular on how professionals working with homeless people in the voluntary sector produce \nknowledge about homelessness. As key social actors positioned at the interface between the \nhomeless, the statutory sector, policy makers and society as a whole, homelessness professionals \nworking in the voluntary sector (from now on HP) offer a privileged entry point for understanding \nprocesses of social construction of homelessness and the health of the homeless person. We define \nHPs as experts in context: mediators, translators and integrators of beliefs, meanings and images of \nhomelessness circulating in the UK.  \n \nDrawing on the theory of social representations (Jodelet, 1989\/1991; Moscovici, 2000) and the \nconcept of cognitive polyphasia (Jovchelovitch, 2002, 2007; Moscovici, 1961\/1976), we argue that \nHPs\u2019 knowledge production is a plural affair shaped by the definitional clashes and competing \napproaches that characterize the context of service provision. Moving between the streets, hostels \nand official meetings with statutory agencies, listening to the tales and witnessing the practices of \nthose who are out in the streets, adjusting their experience-based knowledge to the definitions and \nmodels of intervention of statutory programmes, HPs are a living site of negotiations and \nresolutions about homelessness. Understanding how they make sense of the problem and develop \npractices to deal with it can produce fresh insights on the complexities involved in defining \n 5 \nhomelessness in the UK and contribute to improve the care and services needed by homeless \npeople. As we shall argue, constructions about what homelessness is also encompass constructions \nabout who is the homeless person and how she should be treated. They also shed light on how the \nclashes between different forms of knowing in contemporary public spheres impact on the \ndefinition and resolution of social problems such as health.  \n \nHOMELESSNESS AND HEALTH \n \nIt is now widely accepted that health is a relational construct dependent on the larger material, \nsocial and symbolic living conditions in which social actors find themselves (W.H.O. & UNICEF, \n1978). Rather than being the absence of disease, health involves physical, psychological and social \nwell being. An expanded understanding of health makes visible its connections with social and \ncultural contexts showing that poverty and inequality have a direct impact on the health of \nindividuals and communities. In addition,  relationships with others and the discourses held by \nothers about one\u2019s self or social group impact directly on the self-esteem, autonomy and capacity of \nactors to engage in health behaviours and seek social and material support that will improve health. \nIn the case of the homeless this is particularly true. Research in the UK has continuously shown that \nhomeless people are more likely to suffer from mental, physical and social health problems than \nother sectors of the population (Aldridge, 1997; CESI, 2005; Crisis, 2005). Stress, stigma, \nabandonment, neglect, low self-esteem, substance abuse all emerge through the relational processes \nbetween the homeless and the social world.  \n \nHodgetts and colleagues (this issue) have shown that stigma and a loss of sense of self are \nassociated with substance misuse and escapist strategies typically used by homeless people. They \nconvincingly argue that otherizing processes that construct deviance and separation from \nmainstream domiciled society are materialised in the body of the homeless producing ill-health and \n 6 \na diminished sense of worth and self-esteem. This is corroborated by studies on the importance \ngranted to meaningful personal relationships by the homeless. Tosi (2005) found that homeless \npeople consider the relational dimension an essential resource for their material and emotional \nsupport, for reintegration and for re-establishing equilibrium in their lives.  \n \nThese dimensions make clear that homelessness and the social and symbolic constructions it \nprojects onto the identity and experience of the homeless can undermine the health of the homeless \nand place this population in a situation of increased risk. The research we report below corroborates \nthese findings by exposing the processes whereby the knowledge of experts working in the \nvoluntary sector defines the experience of homeless and the self-understanding of the homeless \nperson.  \n \nWHAT IS HOMELESSNESS?  \n \nClear consensus about the importance of a comprehensive approach to homelessness has not \ndissipated widespread disagreements about what homelessness means, who belongs to this group, \nand what are the best solutions to resolve this social problem. Central to these disagreements is the \nvery context of support structures for the homeless in the UK, which rests on both statutory (public \nsector, state controlled) and non-statutory (voluntary sector) agencies. Clashes between these two \nsectors are common and framed by different definitions of homelessness, diverging understandings \nof its causes and disagreements in relation to the intentionality behind homelessness. Indeed \ndefining to which extent the homeless person is intentionally causing the situation of homelessness \nsharply demarcates the approaches between statutory and voluntary agencies. Underlying these \ndifferences are deeper social psychological and political issues related to the role of the individual \nand the social in the construction of homelessness.  \n \n 7 \nThe standard approach of the statutory sector is based on access to accommodation and the \nintentionality of the individual person in constructing the situation of homelessness. Homeless \npeople are defined in terms of unintentionally lacking secure or permanent accommodation \n(Warnes, Crane, Whitehead, & Fu, 2003). Once evaluated and considered to fit within criteria of \neligibility and basic categories of priority need, people are channeled into the procedures for the \nallocation of housing and referred to services of the welfare system, such as social services and the \nNHS. Lack of comprehensive joined-up strategies between housing and other specialist areas \n(CESI, 2005), and the absence of a more comprehensive approach, which attends to the emotional \nand social needs of the target population have consistently led to the recurrence of episodes of \nhomelessness. As various commentators have pointed out (Jacobs, Kemeny, & Manzi, 1999; \nWarnes et al., 2003), in adopting very restricted eligibility criteria to establish the boundaries of its \ntarget population, the statutory sector covers very limited dimensions of homelessness, reducing the \nphenomena to a problem of \u2018lack of roof over one\u2019s head\u2019 caused by factors outside an individual\u2019s \ncontrol. Mainstream policies have constructed two different groups of people: those who are \nunintentionally homeless and are therefore considered statutory and those who are intentionally \nhomeless. This in turn has generated two groups of people: the deserving and the undeserving; those \nwho are unintentionally homeless and therefore deserve services and support structures, and those \nwho are homeless through conditions of their own making and therefore do not deserve the \nattention of statutory services (Clapham, 2003). The latter group is not officially regarded as \nhomeless and has no legal rights to housing or support services. They are thus left to seek help from \nthe voluntary sector. \n \nThe central marker of the voluntary sector\u2019s definition of homelessness is that it does not include \nthe criterion of intentionality. The sector defines homelessness in broader terms and understands it \nas a multi-faceted phenomena; an experience that affects all aspects of one\u2019s live. They \nacknowledge that beyond \u2018roofless-ness\u2019 there are multiple forms of homelessness, and take into \n 8 \naccount the heterogeneity of the homeless population as well as the complexity of support needs \nthat exist alongside the lack of housing. Thus their responses are not only focused on alleviating a \nspecific situation or crisis (i.e. through outreach work, food and health care), but also on prevention, \naiding continuity along their pathway of services towards independence (i.e. advice and tenancy \nsupport services, training and employment projects). The aim of voluntary services is to deal \ncomprehensively with the diverse and intertwined dimensions of homelessness and enable clients to \nrebuild their lives. This is sought through an individualised and responsive approach.  \n \nThe wide gap in the conceptualization and framing of homelessness by the statutory and voluntary \nsectors is thus at the core of the difficulties confronted by those working with the homeless. \nDualism between the individual and social dimensions has framed the debate and underlies \ndisagreements about what are the best practices for the improvement of the living conditions and \nhealth of homeless people. Theorists have defined the discussion in terms of minimalist or \nmaximalist constructions (Jacobs et al., 1999) of the issue. Minimalist definitions locate the causes \nof homelessness on the individual, have led to the dichotomy between deserving and undeserving \nhomeless and produced interventions designed to deal only with individual factors. Maximalist \ndefinitions see homelessness as the outcome of social-economic shortcomings and put an emphasis \non policy as the key solution to end homelessness. These two definitions stress the importance of \neither social structures or psychological and personal factors, but neglect the connections between \nthem showing a problematic disconnection between individual and structural elements (Clapham, \n2003). Both provide the backdrop against which responses to homelessness take place.  \n \nOperating in such a contested and contradictory context, voluntary HPs face the challenges of \nholding on to their approach and conceptualization while at the same time engaging and dealing \nwith the pressures and demands coming from the statutory sector. The result, as we discuss later in \nthis paper, is a multifaceted and contradictory representational field, made of a patchwork of \n 9 \ndifferent knowledges, values and practices that configure how homelessness is constructed and \ndealt with in the public sphere. \n \nUNDERSTANDING HOMELESSNESS PROFESSIONALS\u2019 KNOWLEDGE: COGNITIVE \nPOLYPHASIA IN REPRESENTATIONAL FIELDS \n \nIt is against the background outlined above that professionals working in the voluntary sector \nconstruct knowledge and practices related to homelessness. Understanding the social position of \nthese professionals and the network of inter-relations that frames their everyday experience is \ncentral to explain the nature of the knowledge they construct and the practices they develop towards \nthe homeless person. We approach this processes through the theoretical lenses of social \nrepresentations theory and in particular through the concept of cognitive polyphasia.  \n \nRepresentations are defined as a system of knowledge collectively constructed through \ncommunicative interaction in order to make sense of the social world (Moscovici, 1984). As a form \nof social knowledge, social representations are symbolic resources through which people give \nmeaning to social structures, experiences and material circumstances. They inform and permeate \nsocial practices influencing the life of individuals and groups. Either as symbolic resources that \nmediate our understanding of the world and guide our actions, or as socio-communicative processes \nof meaning making, social representations are central to the constitution of the social life of groups. \nBecause they are the social action of individuals in relation to other individuals they can only be \nunderstood against the background of one\u2019s positioning within communities and cultural contexts. \nAnd it is because they are grounded in different socio-cultural contexts that social representations \nemerge as plural and heterogeneous fields.  \n \n 10 \nThe concept of cognitive polyphasia (Jovchelovitch, 2002, 2007; Moscovici, 1961\/1976), has been \nburied for a long time within the theoretical corpus of social representations. Presented for the first \ntime in Moscovici\u2019s study of psychoanalysis in France, cognitive polyphasia expresses precisely the \nplurality of representational fields, where differing, and at times conflicting, styles of thinking, \nmeanings and practices co-exist in the same individual, institution, group or community. Current \nresearch in the field of social representations has retrieved and expanded the concept to theorise \nproliferating empirical evidence on the co-existence of plural and contradictory ways of thinking \nused in different ways by individuals and communities to make sense of their everyday lives and \nimportant social issues (e.g. Jovchelovitch & Gervais, 1999; Wagner, Duveen, Verma, & Themel, \n2000; Wagner, Duveen, Themel, & Verma, 1999). \n \nThe concept helps us to understand the multiplicity of voices that speak through individual speakers \nand within social fields. It is a concept linked to the inter-subjective, and therefore communicative, \nnature of all knowledge systems, and to the heterogeneity and diversity of the social fabric. It links \ncognition and knowledge to their social context of production and provides the means to theorise \nhow different representations, meanings and styles of thinking co-exist in public spheres. As \nsocieties become more open to contestation and dissent the concept also sheds light on the \nincreasing representational clashes that emerge from the new regime of encounters between \nknowledge systems in the contemporary world (Jovchelovitch, 2007). Globalised societies, shaped \nby new and multiple forms of communication, offer greater opportunities for encounters between \ndifferent types of knowledge and different views of the world. As a consequence of these \nencounters, the nature of knowledge changes towards more hybrid systems characterized by the co-\npresence of multiple contents and modalities of thinking (Jovchelovitch, 2002, 2007).  \n \nPolyphasic representational fields operate as assets for individuals and communities, offering a \nmultiplicity of co-existing knowledge resources from which they draw the tools, concepts, practices \n 11 \nand meanings that enable them to cope with the everyday and make sense of what is going on. \nRather than being monological in content, cognitive polyphasia in representational fields expresses \nthe dialogical nature of all knowledge systems and the constant networks of inter-relations that form \nthe experience of life each day. Within this plurality, individuals accommodate different social \npositions, mediate the eclectic, dilemmatic and contradictory contents and modes of thinking at \ntheir disposal and put to use their social representations. Both the content and the dynamics of \nsocial representations express the inter-relations between the diversity of meanings circulating in \nsociety and how in appropriating, reproducing or challenging them, individual subjects take up and \nnegotiate particular positions within representational fields. In cognitive polyphasia we find thus a \nfertile concept to apprehend macro social psychological processes at the level of de-traditionalised \nsocieties and micro social psychological processes at the level of everyday encounters between \nindividuals, groups and communities holding different traditions, levels of expertise and \npositionings in social fields.  \n \nThese issues play a central role with respect to homelessness and health. The contested nature of \ndefinitions about homelessness, the conflicting views about service provision and the duality of the \nunderstandings about the problem express the multiplicity of the fields of knowledge at once used, \nconstructed and re-constructed by voluntary HPs as they negotiate, translate and mediate the issue \nof homelessness in the public sphere. From the inner reality of homelessness, to policy and the \ngovernment, across the media and the public, HPs are positioned at a variety of interfaces that \nmakes them a fascinating case for the study of processes of construction of polyphasic knowledge. \nAt the same time, it shows that integral to the constitution of homelessness are the dynamics of \nsocio-psychological processes, where representations and discourses about homelessness frame \nservices, influence treatments, and ultimately affect the way the homeless person constructs her life, \nher reaction to provision and her personal decisions about accessing support structures (Clapham, \n2003).  \n 12 \nMETHOD \n \nIn order to explore the representations held by HPs about homelessness we favoured a qualitative \napproach based on in-depth individual interviews. These offer scope for interviewees to construct \nand express their knowledge in an open and relatively unconstrained way. A total of thirty-six \nnarrative interviews with HPs working in voluntary organizations of inner London were conducted. \nOf these, twenty-four were with front-line professionals, comprising outreach workers, training and \ndevelopment workers, mental health\/drug misuse workers and project workers. These professionals \nwork in direct contact with the homeless and are for most of the time in the field. Twelve \ninterviewees were conducted with rear-line professionals, comprising policy officers, media \nofficers, campaign officers, fundraisers and directors of programs. Participants were recruited \nthrough letters, emails and by personal contact. The first author worked as a volunteer in a London \nbased NGO for the homeless for nine months, which provided first-hand contact with the everyday \nreality of homelessness professionals and ethnographic data (not reported in this paper). This \nallowed in particular for the segmentation criterion of front-line and rear-line professionals, whose \nspecificities where better understood in the process of direct observation. Interviews lasted between \n60 and 90 minutes, were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim for the analysis. The field work \ntook place between September 2003 and March 2005. \n \nTopics addressed in the interviews were divided into three main themes covering (1) general \ndefinitions and experiences of homelessness and provision of services; (2) issues surrounding \nprofessional identity, including how HPs saw themselves and how they saw the views of others \nabout themselves as professionals in the voluntary sector and (3) issues related to the clashes \nbetween the statutory and the voluntary sector, including representations held about the views of \nstatutory professionals on homelessness and on how differences between statutory and voluntary \nsectors influenced practice and quality of response to homelessness. After transcription, the data \n 13 \nwere analysed with a focus on both the content of knowledge and on the internal dialogues that \nwere expressed by each interviewee. The analysis of internal dialogues was guided by Bakhtin\u2019s \nview that what people convey in conversation comes from the polyphony (1984a) of voices of \nmultiple others that percolate the self of the interlocutor, i.e. institutions, other groups etc. In the \ncase of HPs it soon became clear that each one of the voices interviewed spoke through internal \ndialogues with multiple others representing the statutory sector, mainstream society, the homeless \nthemselves, and an \u201cideal self\u201d that embodied the ethical commitment with the cause and \nontological rights of the homeless person. \n \nHPs\u2019 REPRESENTATIONS OF HOMELESSNESS: HUMANIZATION, INSTITUTIONAL \nDISCOURSES AND IDENTITY \n \nThe contested background against which HPs work and the conflicting nature of the internal and \nexternal dialogues HPs establish in their everyday work shapes the representations they hold about \nhomelessness. Our research found that the dynamics of knowledge production in the community of \nHPs is bound to, and at the same time expresses, the contradictions and clashes of the context where \nit is produced and enacted. Through this dynamics emerges a representational field characterised by \nthe co-existence of polyphasic themes, i.e, themes that are constituted through contradiction and \nplurality in ways of thinking and acting towards homelessness. This applies both to the dynamics \nwithin each one of the major themes as well as to the dynamics between the themes. The clashes \nbetween the co-existing voluntary and statutory sectors and the dilemmas of sustaining the \nresponsive, comprehensive and individualised approach of the voluntary sector, when funded by or \nworking in partnership with the government, frame the representations we found. \n \n 14 \nThe representational field about homelessness held by HPs is organised around three co-existing \nand inter-related themes, each containing its own internal dynamics and contradictory content: (1) \ndiscourses of humanization; (2) institutional discourses and (3) discourses of identity (see Figure 1). \nHumanizing and institutional discourses compete to produce a view of what homelessness is, and it \nis out of this struggling relation that discourses of identity containing representations about the \nidentity of the homeless person emerge. Discourses of humanization, which seek to preserve the \nhomeless person as a holistic human being appeared associated with HPs\u2019 role as communicators \nand educators of the public, politicians and the media. Their campaigning battle against the \notherization of the homeless claims an idealist ethical encounter with the other through practices of \nunderstanding and healing as the first step in a moral commitment to them. In constructing \ndiscourses of humanization HPs enter a conflicting dialogue with the rhetoric of victimization, \nwhich is anchored in images of deficiency and incompleteness of the homeless and is expressed in \npractices of judging and curing. Institutional discourses reflect the dilemmas lived by HPs in their \neveryday work. These refer to the struggle to free themselves from the pressures to conform to the \ndiscourse of funding bodies, predominantly the government, and their efforts to sustain the \nhumanizing ethos of the voluntary sector. They express claims of independence and self-agency to \nput into practice their ethical mission against the pragmatic needs of the job and the wish for the \ndevelopment of the voluntary sector as a professional industry.  \n \nThe clashes between discourses of humanization and institutional discourses and their respective \ninternal contradictions are played out in an ultimate representation of who the homeless person is. \nThis comes out as competing representations of the identity of the homeless, who emerges \nsimultaneously as someone torn between being objectified and victimised or ontologically \nrecognised as a whole human being. \n \n 15 \nFigure 1. Co-existence of polyphasic themes. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe dynamics of HPs\u2019 knowledge is characterized by dialogue between these three contradictory \nand co-existing themes. Hence, their representation is constructed against a background of constant \ncontradiction and dilemmas between: (a) the approach of the voluntary sector grounded in a view of \nthe homeless as a whole person,  (b) the statutory sector\u2019s tendency to victimize and objectify the \nhomeless through labelling the homeless and pushing them into official categories (c) wanting to \nsustain the ethical approach of the voluntary sector, and (d) the pragmatics of everyday work in the \nindustry, which implies having to adjust to the definitions and approaches of others (public funders, \nthe government and statutory professionals). Below we present in more detail the internal dynamics \nof each one of the discourses found. \nHUMANIZATION \nHumanization \nVs. \nVictimization \nINSTITUTIONAL \nDISCOURSES  \nEthics Vs. Pragmatics \nIDENTITY OF THE \nHOMELESS \nOntology Vs. Objectification \nWhole Vs. Fragmented \nBifurcated \n 16 \n \nHumanization and Victimization \nThe contradiction between humanization and victimization is central to HPs\u2019 representations of \nhomelessness. On the one hand, there is a rhetoric of moral commitment to the homeless that, in \nasserting their human dignity and wholeness, seeks to undermine violent representations that reduce \nthem to problems such as drug addiction and mental illness. On the other hand, there is a co-\nexisting rhetoric of victimization in which the homeless are otherized, pitied and represented as \nvoiceless and disempowered. This opposition stems from the clash between different notions of \nhomelessness sustained by different systems of knowledge and sectors of society (common sense, \npolicy, the media, the voluntary sector and the inner reality of homelessness), and experienced first \nhand at the various interfaces in which HPs are located. It is within this location, in communicative \ninteraction with these groups through work practices, press releases, public awareness campaigns, \nresponses to policy and partnerships with the statutory sector that HPs\u2019 social representations \nemerge and change.  \n \nThe conflict between humanization and victimization is also played out at the level of practices, \nwhich appear as the conflict between understanding on the one hand, and judging on the other. \nHealing is the HPs\u2019 ideal approach to deal with the problem of homelessness and it is based on \nempowerment, companionship, and a holistic personalized approach that attempts to deal with the \nwhole person, rather than only with physical conditions. In such a practice HPs function as a \nfootbridge for the homeless towards self-actualization and rebuilding their trusting relationship with \nsociety. As one HP stated:  \n\u2018\u2026building people's self-esteem, building their social confidence, giving them things to do but \ngiving them opportunities to grow and to develop skills or rediscover skills they'd forgotten they \nhad\u2026 Trying to bring people back into mainstream society and give them a place there. Pulling \nthem away from the margins in which they existed because of all these problems, dealing with the \n 17 \nproblems but also trying to give them a boost, give them a push back in, being positive about it and \nlooking about what achieve, helping them to achieve it rather than looking at what their problems \nare and just addressing those problems.\u2019 (Front-line 4)  \n \nHowever, there is an opposing judging rhetoric that represents homelessness as a life downwards, a \nvicious circle of problems related to drugs and mental health, from which one needs to be cured. \nCuring reflects the pragmatics of everyday work, of the industry and ultimately, of institutional \ndiscourses. (Dis)empowerment, (in)action, (in)capability, (sub)ordination: these notions of the \nperson are evoked when the rhetoric of victimization claims the need of curing. The example below \nshows how HPs also fall into judging practices that otherize the homeless:  \n \n\u2018Now it means someone who doesn't have the opportunities that I've had to make the most of \nthemselves and to live what we would call a \u2018normal\u2019 life. You know. To study, to get \nqualifications, to get a job, to make friends, all these things that are very difficult if you have a, a \nbackground that involves homelessness or living in care or, you're involved with the criminal justice \nsystem.\u2019 (Rear-line 1) \n \nThe co-existence of the conflicting themes of humanization and victimization becomes further clear \nas HPs speak of themselves as \u2018idealistic\u2019 and \u2018fellow human beings of the homeless brother\u2019, \ntowards the \u2018cruel and ignorant\u2019 public and statutory \u2018experts\u2019 (doctors, psychiatric nurses, policy \nofficers), while at the same time re-positioning themselves as \u2018knowledgeable professionals\u2019 who \nare \u2018representatives of the homeless\u2019, as victims in need of compassion from the outside world. This \npolyphasic strategy allows on the one hand, to reassert the truthfulness of the humanization rhetoric \nand the defence of the homeless person as a being who has the right to be given a voice and, on the \nother hand, to sustain practices such as fundraising and campaigning for the homeless. Cognitive \n 18 \npolyphasia here becomes a resource that allows shifting discourses of humanization and \nvictimization to respond to different needs and demands to deal with the problem.  \n \nInstitutional Discourses: Ethics and Pragmatics.  \nThis discourse shows HPs\u2019 dynamic conflict between putting into practice the ethics of the \nvoluntary sector, and the simultaneous need to adjust to the representations and practices defined by \ngovernment and private funding bodies. Institutional discourses are constituted by the daily struggle \nof the HP, which is rooted in the dilemma between the nature of the voluntary sector as an industry \nthat demands professionalism and productivity and its ethical mission. This paradox is unfolded \nthrough an opposing dyad of representations of the homeless as both \u2018clients \/ social cause\u2019 and \n\u2018products\u2019 of the voluntary sector. The co-existence of this contradiction is another example of \ncognitive polyphasia, and expresses the dynamics of HPs\u2019 work, where practicing the ethos of the \nvoluntary sector is appropriate under certain circumstances, and adjusting to the approaches of the \nstatutory sector and following governmental measures of progress in terms of \u2018hard indicators\u2019 are \njustified as adequate in the context of the industry. In both cases, adjusting to the statutory \nframework is an exigency of the pragmatics of their job. As noted by one HP: \n \n\u2018Emotional blackmail, you know\u2026(laughs) I think for the funding, we had to do a lot of work on \nshowing what we call soft indicators. So, if an indication of success for somebody was getting a job \nat one end (laughs), we've had to really look at, at the end, somebody gaining self-esteem, you \nknow, attending group for the first time, attending a class or some work for the first time, somebody \nturning up for a session and not drinking for an entire day and then not drinking for two days, so it \nis kind of showing up in all of those first steps in order to get this last step. We've been \ndocumenting, you know, and showing funders that our clients need to go through those five steps or \nwe've got to think about those. \u2026 yes, we will aim for so many percent of people to be high \n 19 \nachieving, to go into training or jobs, but we also want to be able to cater within that bid for those \nsoft outcomes as well.  \u2026\u2019 (Front-line 3) \n \nDespite non-conformism HPs also declare the need to be submissive to the statutory client and its \nagenda. Within this context the homeless is marketed and traded, sold and campaigned for with the \naim of being funded. Here victimization of the homeless co-exists in polyphasic contradiction with \nthe ethos of the voluntary sector. It is used as a rhetorical device in playing \u2018the system\u2019 (i.e. private \nand governmental funding bodies). It is appropriate and justified as an essentially surviving strategy \nwithin the context of state funding since this is the only way of responding to the needs of the \nvictim. Consequently constructions of homelessness in terms of statutory legal definitions and hard \noutcomes co-exist along with those of the ethos of the voluntary sector, i.e. achieving \u2018soft \noutcomes\u2019 such as self-esteem and self-worth. The following example shows how adjusting to \ninstitutional discourses jeopardizes the humanization of the homeless. \n  \n\u2018I think that it's possible even that homeless professionals who don't work with street homeless \npeople, I think that they might even have a, a double picture in their mind, you know.  Homeless is \nthat person sleeping on the street outside the tube station and then homeless is, you know, this \nperson, you know, my client who has, you know, just come out of hospital or something.  I'm \nreferring to this project and I need to call him homeless.  And I think they actually can mean two \ndifferent things when I say that because I think that just like anyone they, they just slot the label on \nif it's useful and doesn't actually necessarily mean that they see their clients as homeless. \u2019 (Front-\nline 5) \n \nBy positioning themselves as \u2018defiant nonconformist grass roots\u2019 members of the voluntary sector \nand as \u2018idealistic HPs\u2019, interviewees claim the homeless client as their ultimate aim, and invoke an \nemancipating and liberating counter-agenda. Here the significant others that are responded to are \n 20 \nboth the \u2018bureaucratized and careless government\u2019, and the \u2018socially irresponsible public\u2019. This is \noften put to practice through public awareness campaigns and critical responses to policy \nconsultations.  \n \nAnother important aspect that emerges in the oppositions found in institutional discourses is the \nclaim HPs make of their own expertise vis-\u00e0-vis the expertise of the professionals of the statutory \nsector. The rhetorical aim is to contest statutory experts\u2019 views of the voluntary sector as amateur \nand present themselves as highly professional. This is yet another battle that HPs have to fight in \ntheir daily practice when working in partnership with statutory experts from the NHS, housing and \nbenefit departments, since there is low recognition of their work from the main statutory welfare \nagencies (Warnes et al., 2003). Despite HPs position as \u2018members of the voluntary homeless sector\u2019 \nattempting to put into practice their ethos, they also dilemmatically re-position themselves as \n\u2018professional experts of the homeless industry (contractors)\u2019. In shuffling between positions they \naccomplish a discursive practice of sacrifice of their ethos and their subordination to institutional \npractices.  \n \nIdentity \n \nThe conflicting dialogue between discourses of humanization and institutional discourses in HPs\u2019 \nrepresentation of homelessness, is played out in a set of co-existing representations and images of \nthe identity of the homeless person. These are organized in terms of contradictions: ontology vs. \nobjectification, whole vs. fragmented, resulting in a bifurcated identity. \n \nThere is across all participants a rhetoric of disclaiming the objectification of the homeless label \nsince it acts as a forced identity perpetuating the experience of homelessness. Freeing the homeless \n 21 \nfrom the taken-for-granted meanings attached to the label is seen as an essential element of the \nprocess of resolving homelessness. Using the label implies an external and internal process of social \nexclusion: external through prejudice, stigma and stereotyping sustained by the outside, and internal \nthough self-identification and internalisation of the homeless label. This forced identity perpetuates \nthe homeless as an outsider, socially and psychologically. As stated by a participant: \n  \n\u2018It just, it is like a tag that seems to automatically come with a homeless person and you just think like \nwell \u2026. I think that there are some assumptions of \u2018yeah, he wouldn't possibly fit in. They are all like \ncrazy hair, big beards, alcoholics\u2019. You know. Often from people you think should really know better, \nyou know, rather than something you know.\u2019 (Front-line 1) \n \nObjectification occurs through judgement and lack of understanding shaped by representations of \nthe homeless as a deviant other. It is equally sustained by statutory practices of tagging people with \nan official homeless category (i.e. unintentional homeless) required by mainstream welfare services. \nIn being labelled, the person is cut off from his\/her past history and present experience experiencing \nloss of a sense of self and feelings of exclusion. Statutory definitions are criticised for ideologically \ninstituting the meaning of the homeless experience whilst neglecting the person\u2019s ontological \nexperience. Despite being highly disclaimed, this process of objectification is also dilemmatically \ndisclosed in the interviewees\u2019 utterances. Thus, at points they represent the person as fragmented \ninto her problems (addictions, mental health), visual images, physicality (roofless-ness), and the \npsychological (self-esteem, mental health). \n \n \u2018And because I think the phrase \u2018homelessness\u2019 has the capacity to\u2026  I can't think of any other word \nbut dehumanize, has the capacity to dehumanize, those who are labelled with it to just, to mean that \nthey're just a problem and not a person. And I think if you're working with homeless people day to day, \nyou can see through that. Yeah\u2019 (Rear-line 4) \n 22 \nThese representations show that paradoxically HPs\u2019 are both holders and contesters of \nrepresentations that fragment the homelessness. They are themselves in conflict with this \nfragmentation since it is based on the approach of the statutory sector and undermines their multi-\ndimensional and holistic approach. Here we can clearly see the contradictory nature of the \nrepresentational field and the manifold voices speaking through the voice of the HP. \n \n\u2018And it's hard because different, different professionals have responsibilities for different parts of \npeople's lives then people's lives kind of tend to get broken up into chunks and given to different \npeople which is ridiculous because the poor person is in the middle and to them everything is all \npart of one thing, you know, but, you know, different people are responsible for different things.\u2019 \n(Front-line 5) \n \nThe key dialogue constructing these representations is with the statutory sector. Statutory services \nare regarded as producing a \u2018pathological\u2019 bifurcated identity that creates an impasse in the self. \nOnce inside the hostel\/accommodation system the person is separated from her own peer-group or \n\u2018sub-society\u2019, which is source of social identity, support and sense of community. She is removed \nfrom a source of identification and simultaneously put through an experience where she is tagged as \n\u2018homeless\u2019 and in need of a \u2018cure\u2019 to be \u2018normal\u2019.  It is impossible to escape from the otherising \nprocess: in offering the service there is an invitation to be normal, yet by the same token there is the \nimposition of the label.  \n \n \u2018And when you think of, people moving into like rough sleeper flats \u2026. They don't build them with \nthe idea that people are going to change from the status of homelessness into being a couple, having \na family. When they want to make an exchange, they can't, it's difficult for people to move. They \nhave to move to another rough sleeper flat. They can't say, \u2018but that's not me anymore\u2019. (Front-line \n1) \n 23 \n \nHPs\u2019 REPRESENTATIONS OF HOMELESSNESS, IDENTITY AND HEALTH \n \nHPs working in the voluntary sector contribute decisively to the social construction of \n\u2018homelessness\u2019 and in consequence to the self-understanding of homeless people. They are \npositioned at the interface of the homeless and the outside world and as professional practitioners \nact as \u2018vectors\u2019 between various social spheres, being important carriers and shapers of social \nknowledge and public images of their clients (Morant, 1997,  p.82). They implement both policy \nand expert theoretical knowledge, integrate it into their practices, inform the public, raise funds and \noffer feedback to policymakers. They perform a pivotal task in communicating and explaining the \nissue of \u2018homelessness\u2019 to the public, politicians and the media (Hutson & Liddiard, 1994). In \nproposing their versions of \u2018homelessness\u2019, HPs negotiate, challenge and\/or contest the meaning of \n\u2018homelessness\u2019 held by other interest groups with whom they intersect. They have been advocating \nfor change within policy and campaigning for raising awareness of the limitations of statutory \nservices. HPs have the potential to question and contest reified forms of knowledge and are able to \nadopt a more comprehensive and individualised relationship with their client. Theirs is an expertise \nthat comes from the day-to-day experience with homelessness. All these features define HPs as \nexperts in context and make the representations they hold key indicators in the process of \nunderstanding homelessness and its consequences in the living conditions and health of the \nhomeless person.  \n \nThe contradictions and polyphasic themes found in the representational field we uncovered show \nthat constructions about homelessness have a direct impact on the construction of practices towards \nthe homeless, the definition of provision and the design of policies, and the identity of the homeless \nperson. All these issues are present as professionals working with homeless people struggle to \ndefine the problem and provide support and care to this population. Recognising that issues of \n 24 \nhealth and homelessness are grounded in the way homelessness is constructed helps to understand \nwhy it is important to integrate HPs\u2019 knowledge into the design of policy, decisions about \nhealthcare systems and services aiming at tackling homelessness. Our data shows that \nrepresentations about homelessness held by HPs express the multiple networks of interaction and \nstruggle that construct homelessness and the homeless person. They reveal the dilemmas and \ncontradictions of the field and the impasses related to the identity and life conditions of this \nvulnerable group. Through the contestation of notions and practices they contain, we can apprehend \nthe challenges that confront policy makers and the obstacles to the realization of partnerships \nbetween the statutory and the voluntary sectors.  \n \nThe most essential feature of HPs\u2019 way of thinking is the co-existence of internal dilemmas and \ncontradiction, which speak about the complexity of the phenomena of homelessness and point to the \nneed to take into account the intricacy of this issue when designing policy. Representations of \nhomelessness held by HPs are not just about rooflessness, otherness and the need to cure and \nprovide material structures. They are at one and the same time about being otherized, judged and \nreduced to problems and being understood as a whole human, about being labeled and deserving a \npersonalized approach, about being fragmented through reductionistic and unconnected services \nand being comprehensively treated, about being cured and being accompanied along the healing \nprocess towards self-actualization and re-development of potentialities, about being a social cause \nof the voluntary sector and being a product of the industry. Clear in these oppositional is the \nintrinsic connection between the social representations of homelessness, the practices and policies \ntowards the homeless, the identity and health of the homeless. A proper understanding of the \ncontradictions involved in these constructions, and the alternative pathways they suggest, can help \nthose involved in working with homelessness elements for reflection and for moving further the \nstate of the debate. \n \n 25 \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nIn this article we sought to contribute to debates between homelessness and health by examining \nsocial psychological dimensions involved in the constitution of homelessness and the role they play \nin the identity, living conditions and health of the homeless. We focused on the construction of \nsocial representations of homelessness by HPs working in the voluntary sector and highlighted the \nimportance and value of HPs\u2019 knowledge of homelessness in framing understanding of \nhomelessness and consequent policies of care and service provision. We have shown that HPs work \nin a context of definitional clashes and conflicting approaches between the statutory and voluntary \nsectors, which sharply shapes the process of knowledge construction and the state of cognitive \npolyphasia expressed in the representations they hold. The context of service provision, HPs \nparticular location at the intersection between different spheres of knowledge and social sectors, and \ntheir movements from the front-line of homelessness to the spheres of policy making and the public, \nprovide resources for these professionals to make sense of homelessness and construct the multiple \ncontents and dialogues that form the knowledge they hold.  \n \nWe have shown HPs\u2019 knowledge of homelessness to be polyphasic and contain co-existing and \nconflicting themes. These oppositional themes, rather than being mutually exclusive, live side by \nside and operate as an asset from which HPs can draw the resources to deal with the contradictions \nand challenges of the contested context in which they work. As a community of professionals, HPs \nseek to defend and put into practice their professional ethos and ideals of good practice, whilst \nhaving to adapt to the pragmatics and institutional requirements of their job. Their representations \npoint to the troubling consequences that interventions framed by job pragmatics and the institutional \ndiscourses of others have for the identity, well-being and health of the homeless.  \n \n 26 \nDespite government attempts to establish an \u2018objective\u2019 legal definition that could guide statutory \nwelfare and care delivery, we are convinced that without understanding how notions of \nhomelessness are constructed in conditions of everyday life health interventions and policy will \nremain partial and disconnected with what really happens on the ground. In the UK, where \nhomeless people are still exposed to high levels of health inequalities (Gorton, 2003), this issue \nremains an essential, if challenging, task. Given the wealth of information they contain and the \ndirect connection with the reality of homelessness they express, sensitivity to the knowledge of HPs \nis a key strategy to resolve the challenges facing policy makers and experts working for the care of \nthe homeless today.  \n 27 \nREFERENCES \n \nAldridge, R.
