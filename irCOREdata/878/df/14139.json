IM contrasts with synchronous chat in this respect, since this is usually\norganised through publicly accessible chat rooms. Dating back to the moment the\nfirst computer networks were available in the 1970s, messaging experienced signifi-\ncant growth in the late 1990s via the rapid growth of AOL\u2019s Instant Messenger in the\nUnited States and the MSN Messenger system in Europe, both of which provided\nfree consumer applications for IM. While early use of the tool could be characterised\nas being for fun, IM today is more usually considered to be a serious communication\n*Corresponding author.

Especially among young people, it has become one of the primary commu-\nnication means (PEW Internet, 2004, 2005; Qrius, 2005), with its own culture and\nlanguage.\nCommercial organisations are aware of this development as well, but in our expe-\nrience educational institutions have been very reluctant about adopting this medium.\nFor example, many schools consider instant messaging as a mere fun tool for children\nin their spare time, and some even ban it from any school activity. Also, the research\nfield of educational technology shows only a small number of studies on IM, as\ncompared with other tools such as web-logging and communities. Several studies indi-\ncate that IM can indeed be a valuable tool in current education, which has changed\nits approach from being top-down organised to a more bottom-up approach based on\nsocial\u2013constructivist theories and competence-based education. In this new educa-\ntional model, IM could for example be used by students to practice their language\nproficiency skills with distant fellow-students (Coniam & Wong, 2004). Other possible\nimplementations are synchronous tutor guidance through IM or students using IM\nto reflect on fellow-students\u2019 work. Social developments, and especially the current\nICT adoption wave among youth (Prensky, 2001), should influence the choices one\nmakes regarding the implementation of the medium in or outside our classrooms.\nThe few studies conducted on IM up until today, however, use relatively small\nsample sizes and have an explorative nature (for example, Nicholson, 2002; Coniam\n& Wong, 2004). As a first step towards a better understanding of the possibilities for\neducational use of IM, we want to gain insights in how students currently use IM and\nwhat opportunities they see for the medium themselves. These insights are valuable,\nin order to be able to develop software that answers to user needs. To that end we\nconducted a survey among students of the Fontys University of Applied Sciences in\nThe Netherlands. This article reports the results of this study.\nInstant messaging defined\nFor those unfamiliar with instant messaging, Castellucio\u2019s definition mentioned in\nthe Introduction might not be sufficient. Grinter and Palen use the following, more\nelaborate description: \nIM systems support Internet-based synchronous text chat, with point-to-point communi-\ncation between users on the same system. A window is dedicated to the conversation, with\nmessages scrolling upward and eventually out of view as the conversation ensues. IM also\nsupports group chat, with users inviting others to join them in a specified \u2018room.\u2019 Some\nsystems, such as AIM and ICQ, make some chat rooms public. In some IM systems,\npictures and URLs can be included in the messaging. Colors and fonts are personalizable.\n\u2018Buddy\u2019 lists display information about IM cohorts. Buddies\u2019 on-line handles (usernames)\nare displayed, along with indicators of activity (usually as a function of input device use)\nand availability (as inferred by activity and as stated explicitly by user-specified settings).\nBuddies can be sorted into user-defined categories such as \u2018friends,\u2019 \u2018family,\u2019 \u2018co-workers\u2019\nand so forth. (2002, p. 21)\nIn this description, IM is limited to text-based communication. However, most IM\nsystems now offer audio and video chatting functionalities as well. Also, IM is not\nStudents and instant messaging 145\nlimited to one-to-one communication. Users can add additional users to create group\nconversations. In most cases, the IM communication is handled through a software\napplication installed on a users\u2019 computer. The majority of this software is free.\nPopular messaging systems are MSN Messenger (which recently migrated to\nWindows Live Messenger), AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, Skype,\nGoogle Talk and ICQ. This last one initiated a popularity boost among Internet users\nin the second half of the 1990s. However, most of the current IM systems are (partly)\nbased on an older online chat medium: Internet Relay Chat.\nTogether, Wikipedia estimates that IM systems currently have over 250 million\nactive users. Most systems use their own protocol, which prevents them from being\ninteroperable. So users with an AOL account cannot communicate with MSN users.\nSeveral attempts, for example by The Internet Engineering Task Force, to adopt a\nsingle, open, newly developed standard protocol have failed; it is only recently\nthat Yahoo and Windows Live have opened up their protocols for each other.\nInteroperability will probably be one of the main challenges for IM\u2019s lasting success.\nSocial developments: youth and instant messaging\nThe number of active IM users (approximately 250 million worldwide) shows the\nsuccess of the medium in the short period (since the late 1990s) it has been available\nto the public. Especially among teenagers, IM has become one of the most important\ncommunication means. More than 70% of today\u2019s youth uses IM, as surveys in the\nUnited States (12\u201317 year olds) and The Netherlands (6\u201329 year olds) show (PEW\nInternet, 2005; Qrius, 2005). According to the American research, only 44% of the\nadults used the medium. Furthermore, the Dutch survey showed that IM shares first\nplace with email as the most popular activity for teenagers when online. The medium\nis used on a much more serious level than many adults might think. Through IM,\nteenagers communicate with their friends, make appointments, date (PEW Internet,\n2001) and collaborate on school tasks (Grinter & Palen, 2002). Teenagers do about\neverything online through IM, since \u2018the buddy list is teens\u2019 social world\u2019 (Boneva\net al., 2006). The rising popularity of social networking websites such as Facebook\nand MySpace (PEW Internet, 2007), which incorporate IM functionality into their\nsystems, makes it even easier for teenagers to meet new social contacts online.\nGrinter and Palen (2002) point out that examining this development of IM usage\namong teenagers provides valuable insights. IM is the first and most successful form\nof social software that has entered into the public\u2019s lives. Studying the way in which\nthe younger generation uses it, teaches us about its \u2018role in domestic ecology\u2019; also,\nthe \u2018communication habits they develop now may indicate what we can expect from\nthem as adults\u2019 (Grinter & Palen, 2002, p. 22).\nInstant messaging and education\nThe studies on IM use mentioned indicate that youths already use the medium for\neducational activities. As already indicated, however, education has been neglecting\n146 G. de Bakker et al.\nthe serious medium it has grown up to be. This might indicate that IM would not be\na suitable medium for education, but there are strong arguments to the contrary. For\nexample, Farmer (2005) conducted an IM experiment among students, concluding\nthat they had a positive attitude towards the medium. However, empirical results are\navailable as well. A survey among students of the Syracuse University School of Infor-\nmation Studies in New York showed that students benefited from the use of IM as a\ntool for socialisation with fellow students outside lectures (Nicholson, 2002). Several\nstudies have shown the value of the implementation of IM as an online library refer-\nencing service (Foley, 2002; Andrews, 2004; Cummings & Guerlain, 2004; Fagan,\n2004; Johnson, 2004). Coniam and Wong (2004) tested IM as a tool for language\nproficiency training between students from different countries. Although the\nmeasured quantitative differences were not statistically significant, a qualitative anal-\nysis showed improvements in the language proficiency skills of the participating\nstudents. Hrastinski (2006) showed that adding IM to an asynchronous distance\nlearning course stimulated student participation.\nHowever, to enable education to determine the real benefits of IM, more empirical\nevidence is needed. Our future research will focus on identifying and exploring\nopportunities for IM in class. To avoid the pitfall of implementing information and\ncommunication technologies solutions that are not sufficiently based on actual\ndemands, we first want to have better insights in how students currently use IM and\nwhat their wishes are for its use in education. For example, if students would state\nthat they are willing to use IM for consultation with teachers, but not for online\ncollaboration with fellow students, we should take that into account in the design of\nan experiment of educational IM applications.\nPreviously, several surveys have been conducted on IM use among youth (PEW\nInternet, 2005; Qrius, 2005). However, these studies did not provide data on educa-\ntional use. At the same time, the few surveys conducted specifically on educational\nIM use (Grinter & Palen, 2002; Nicholson, 2002; Farmer, 2005; Boneva et al., 2006),\nand the experimental studies on IM use available (Andrews, 2004; Coniam & Wong,\n2004; Fagan, 2004), used relatively small sample sizes and, in most cases at least,\nconsisted of user experience and appreciation data. A larger study therefore is needed\nto get a better indication of students\u2019 IM use. Such a study should also gauge\nstudents\u2019 demands for the implementation of IM in their studies, as such data are also\nso far conspicuously lacking. To serve these ends, a survey was conducted among\nstudents at a Dutch institution for higher education.\nThe study\nParticipants\nAll participants were students at the Fontys University of Applied Sciences in The\nNetherlands. A number of its institutes were willing to forward a request mail to their\nstudents. Participants had to fill in their institutional personal identification number\nat the start of questionnaire, to prevent them from completing the online form more\nStudents and instant messaging 147\nthan once (they might want to do so in order to have a better chance at winning\nthe lottery prize made available to them for maximising the response). Eventually,\n376 male and 405 female students participated. They were aged 16\u201357 years. The\nparticipants came from various studies in arts, science and humanities.\nMaterials and procedures\nBased on the motive for this initial IM study, we analysed students\u2019 perspectives\nrather than examining what they are actually doing. A questionnaire with mainly\nmultiple-choice questions was set-up. The questionnaire was based on questionnaires\nused in previous studies on IM use (PEW Internet, 2001; Grinter & Palen, 2002;\nBoneva et al., 2006), with additional questions added.\nThe questionnaire was published online on a separate web space of the Fontys insti-\ntute\u2019s website. Students received an email with an explanation of the study, and the\nrequest for completing the online form. Also, a news item was published on the insti-\ntute\u2019s intranet to attract more people to the survey website. In total, approximately\n4500 students were approached. Some of these received an email, which resulted in\nan initial response of 668 completed forms. After the news item was published on the\ninstitute\u2019s intranet website, an additional 113 responses came in, providing a total of\n781 responses. Thus, the response rate was 17%. This is a fairly low percentage,\nwhich we feel is due to the non-committal way respondents were approached.\nResults\nThe results are organised in terms of the specific aspects of IM usage we were looking\nfor: IM use frequency patterns, technological specifications of users\u2019 environments,\nsocial aspects of IM usage and school use. Finally, the results of the specific questions\nasked on students\u2019 views on educational implementation of the medium are\ndescribed. In order to find out whether generation differences show different results,\nthe data were analysed using a Pearson product moment analysis.\nInstant messaging use frequency patterns\nThe survey shows that 96% of all respondents used IM. In this group, 74% indicated\nthey used IM on a (nearly) daily basis: five to seven days a week. These data correspond\nto a previous Dutch IM survey (Qrius, 2005) and American survey results on Internet\nuse (PEW Internet, 2005). Female students used the medium more often than their\nmale colleagues. It could be argued that IM use develops over time. Forty-eight per\ncent of the respondents using IM indicated that they used the medium more often\ncompared with the first time they used it. However, at the same time, 34% used it\nless often.\nPossible differences between disciplines were also examined. As the disciplines\nwere so diverse, we were only able to compare science students (e.g. physics, natural\nsciences, computer science, etc.) with the rest of the student population (e.g. history,\n148 G. de Bakker et al.\nlanguages, economics, etc.). Technological tools such as IM are at first often mainly\nused by technophiles, before becoming widespread among a larger public. In contrast\nwith what people might expect, however, the science students (often considered to be\nthe technophiles compared with other students) did not use IM more intensively than\nthe other students, as Table 1 shows.\nIM is usually used in between other computer activities (65%). When taking the\ntime for it, only 24% of chats last longer than one hour. Also, most participants indi-\ncated that on an average day they do not talk to more than 10 people (95%). The\nmajority of the communication is done in separate conversations; only 3% of the\nrespondents stated they used the group conversation functionality in their IM system\nregularly. It can be argued that IM is characterised by short sessions and a fragmented\nuse throughout the day.\nAlthough the questionnaire had options for respondents to note that they were not\nusing IM at all, very few (8%) did. This prompts the question whether IM users are\nmore than proportionally present among the respondents (selection bias). As it is to\nbe expected that people who actually use the medium already respond differently\nfrom those who do not, one should only carefully extrapolate results to the entire\npopulation. This issue should be taken into account in future research. However,\nother surveys, which used respondent approaching procedures that guaranteed a\nmore balanced population, show similar IM use figures (Qrius, 2005). A survey\nspecifically on IM use in the United States showed lower use frequency percentages\n(PEW Internet, 2004), but this used an adult sample only.\nTechnological specifications of users\u2019 environments\nIn The Netherlands, IM is often being referred to as \u2018MSN-ing\u2019, since MSN\nMessenger\/Windows Live Messenger is the most popular service in the country. The\nsurvey results confirm this, 99% of the IM-using respondents uses this messaging\nsystem. Almost one-quarter of all students (24%) also use Skype. Other less\nfrequently used systems are ICQ, Google Talk, Internet Relay Chat, AIM (the most\nused system in the United States) and Yahoo messenger. Mac users also mentioned\nTable 1.

The majority of respondents mainly use text chatting. Voice and video\nchat are being used \u2018sometimes\u2019 by 33% and 44%, respectively, and more than one-\nhalf of the respondents \u2018never\u2019 use either.\nTwo places are most popular for using IM: at home on a students\u2019 personal\ncomputer (78%) and in school (69%). Other places are at home on a shared computer\n(42%), at a friend\u2019s house (18%) or at work (11%). Only 8% of the students use IM\non a mobile device.\nSocial aspects of instant messaging usage\nMost students have quite an extensive buddy list (IM contact list). One-third of all\nstudents have more than 100 friends in their messenger list. Also, people who use IM\nmore regularly have a larger contact list. Although these are impressive figures, Danah\nBoyd argues these online friends have a different status to real-life friends (Boyd,\n2006). A large number of students (36%) indicated that they would have a hard time\nmissing the availability of IM.\nStudents tend to treat the medium rather freely. Sixty-eight per cent of all respon-\ndents have ignored messages in the past, and 88% have even blocked contacts in their\nbuddy list (making it impossible for those contacts to see or talk to them).\nConversation topics are very diverse. Table 2 presents the survey conversation\ntopic categories and the percentage of participants using them.\nSchool use and students\u2019 views on educational implementation of IM\nThe majority of students (89%) used IM for one or more study activities; 67% even\nused it for five or more of the study activities mentioned in the questionnaire.

Almost one-half\nof the students mentioned more than five activities they would like to see in educa-\ntional IM. Table 3 presents the educational IM activities mentioned in the survey and\nthe percentages of students using them already personally. The last column repre-\nsents the percentage of students that would like to see these activities being imple-\nmented in their education. Differences between actual and desired use are small, with\nthe exception of teacher guidance.\nGeneration differences\nThe age of the respondents ranged from 16 to 57 years, but the majority was 19\u201321\nyears old (43% of the respondents). The survey showed some interesting correla-\ntion effects between certain aspects of IM use and demands, and the age of the\nrespondents. We will limit ourselves to describing only the correlations that proved\nsignificant (\u03b1 = 0.01). In general, younger students are more intensive IM users.\nThey used the medium more often that the older students (r = \u22120.389), had more\nbuddies (r = \u22120.429) and used it when connected to the Internet more often (r = \u2212\n0.283). Also, they talked to more people in one day (r = \u22120.326). When looking at\ntechnical specifications, we did not find a significant effect of age. However,\nyounger students seem to replace text-based messaging by audio and video alterna-\ntives more often (r = \u22120.205). When asked whether the respondent would like to\nmake more use of IM, it turned out that the older students were more interested in\ndoing so (r = 0.194).\nOn the educational use of the medium, we did not find major differences between\nages, apart from the younger students discussing school tasks more with their fellow\nTable 3.

This result, however, was only significant at a lower level (\u03b1 =\n0.05). Educational demands did show some interesting differences. In general, a\nlarger number of the younger students would like to see an educational implementa-\ntion of IM in the future. Four out of the nine categories of educational IM use\nstudents could chose from for indicating their use for those purposes showed a nega-\ntive correlation with age. Those categories were \u2018discussing school tasks with fellow\nstudents\u2019, \u2018cooperating on school tasks with fellow students\u2019, \u2018gathering content, such\nas course material\u2019 and \u2018sharing files (such as report concepts or sketches)\u2019. Also, the\noption \u2018I do not want to use IM in my study\u2019 showed a positive correlation (r =\n0.152), which indicates that older students are less willing to use the medium for\neducational purposes. When looking at the activities more specifically, the younger\nstudents would like to have more task discussions (\u22120.100), collaboration (\u22120.101),\ninformation gathering (\u22120.116) and file-sharing (\u22120.142) through IM.\nConclusions and discussion\nIn general, people who make more use of IM also use it longer, have a larger buddy\nlist (IM contacts), and so on. Thus, the adoption wave does not seem to concentrate\non specific aspects of IM usage. Perhaps one of the most interesting findings of this\nstudy is that younger students use IM more intensively than their older peers.\nYounger students are also keener on trying new possibilities of the medium. This indi-\ncates that the adoption of the medium is still developing. It would be interesting to\nsee how this development continues. Will IM become the primary communication\nmedium for everybody? A Dutch youth survey shows this is already the case for a\ncertain age group (Qrius, 2005). It could also be that age plays a big role in the adop-\ntion of the medium. It might be a youth tool people tend to grow out of. This is a\nquestion that can only be answered as the current IM generation grows older. Looking\nat the recent corporate IM implementation wave, and the indicated usefulness of the\nmedium in business contexts (Nardi et al., 2000), the latter it is not to be expected\n(Pauleen & Yoong, 2001; Perry et al., 2001).\nAs noted previously, the survey might have attracted IM users mainly. This\nshould be taken into account for future research. We could test our findings among\na more naturally varied group of students. As this study was part of a research\nproject into educational IM implementation possibilities, in future studies we will\nbe analysing IM conversations more closely in order to gain insights into what\neducational IM conversations consist of in terms of content, communication style,\nand so on. In a later stage, we will also develop new applications or plug-ins for\nexisting IM systems, which make educational use of IM more fit for current educa-\ntion, looking at recent changes such as self-directed learning. An example of such a\nnew application is a peer-tutoring system, which enables students to get instant\nsupport from relevant fellow-students. This not only enables them to get their ques-\ntions answered more quickly, it also reduces the workload for teachers, which has\nincreased due to the introduction of the social\u2013constructivist theories in learning\n(De Vries et al., 2005).\n152 G. de Bakker et al.\nAbove all, the survey shows that education cannot simply ignore the importance of\nIM. Today\u2019s students embrace the medium, and would like to see it being imple-\nmented in their learning environment. Early empirical research has shown that IM\nmight be a useful tool, but the simple fact that students demand the medium\u2019s imple-\nmentation should be enough reason for education to consider that. The fact that only\none-third of the population indicates that they would like to see teacher guidance\nbeing available via IM should be considered in such implementations. This might\nindicate that students are interested in the self-organised bottom-up nature of the\nmedium, which should be preserved when institutionalising it.\nReferences\nAndrews, K. W.
