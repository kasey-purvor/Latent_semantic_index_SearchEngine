This model was inspired by observations \nin patient DF who seemed unable to use vision for perceptual tasks while \nretaining \u201cnormal\u201d visuomotor capacity. I found that DF\u2019s performance is \npreserved in perceptual and visuomotor tasks when the required spatial \ninformation is hand-centred and impaired when the information is object-\ncentred.  \n \nIn 1992 a seminal paper proposed a new model about the division of labour in \nthe human visual pathway1. It was argued that the well-known anatomical \nsegregation between a ventral and dorsal stream2 corresponds to a functional \nspecialization of vision for perception versus action. This model was inspired by \nthe finding that DF, a patient with bilateral damage to the ventral stream, failed in \nperceptual tasks but not in visuomotor tasks3. Although some of the evidence for \nthe model has been criticized (e.g. the evidence from visual illusions4-6, and the \nevidence from optic ataxia7), the perception\/action dissociation found in DF is still \nwidely accepted as convincing evidence for the model8. Here I have examined \nthe possibility that what has been described as a perception\/action dissociation in \nDF may in reality be a dissociation between different modes of visuospatial \nprocessing, namely object-based spatial metrics (allocentric mode) versus \nobserver-based metrics (egocentric mode). Normally the behavioural task and \nthe spatial mode are confounded so that perceptual tasks use allocentric \ninformation, and visuomotor tasks use egocentric information.  \n \nIn this study I decoupled the behavioural task and the spatial mode and asked \nDF (for details on DF, see9) and 10 healthy age-matched women to perform both \na perceptual and a visuomotor task using either allocentric or egocentric \ninformation (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Note). All visual stimuli were computer-\ngenerated, projected onto a mirror covering the subject\u2019s hand and appeared to \nbe in the same plane as the subject\u2019s hand. In the perceptual, allocentric task two \ndots were presented at various distances to the left and right of a cross. Subjects \njudged which of the two dots was closer to the cross. In the egocentric version \nthe tip of the subject\u2019s index finger indicated the reference position. During the \ntrial subjects did not receive visual information about the position of their finger, \nbut had to rely on proprioceptive information. Please note that DF\u2019s \nproprioceptive performance is in the normal range (Supplementary Note). \nBefore the start of the trial a cursor indicating the current position of the index \nfinger was presented, allowing the subject to guide the finger to the reference \nposition. The same procedure was used in the visuomotor tasks to guide \nsubjects\u2019 fingers to their start position. In the allocentric version of the visuomotor \ntask a target point was presented at various distances from a cross. In addition a \nsquare indicating the start position was presented at a separate location. \nSubjects were instructed to point to an invisible target whose position relative to \ntheir own start position was identical to the relative position of the target dot with \nrespect to the cross. In the egocentric version of the visuomotor task, a target \npoint was presented at a given horizontal distance from the start position, \nsubjects had to move their finger from the start position to the target position. The \nmovements were recorded with a Phantom Haptic Interface. To quantify the \nperformance in the perceptual task the minimal difference between distances to \nobtain 80% correct answers was determined (i.e. 80% threshold). To allow a \ndirect comparison between perceptual and visuomotor performance the \ndistribution of the movement amplitudes in the visuomotor tasks was transformed \ninto 80%-distance-discrimination threshold values. For all statistical comparisons \na t-test which was specifically developed for single-case studies was employed10.  \n \nDF\u2019s performance in the allocentric perceptual task was significantly impaired \n(t9=22.92; P<0.0001), whereas her egocentric, visuomotor performance was \nnormal (t9=0.52; P<0.284). This confirms earlier demonstrations of \n\u201cperception\/action\u201d dissociations in DF. However, the results from the other two \nconditions did not fit the pattern of a perception\/action dissociation. DF\u2019s \nperceptual performance was normal in the egocentric condition (t9=1.68; \nP<0.063), whereas her visuomotor performance was abnormal in the allocentric \ncondition (t9=9.94; P<0.0001; Figs.1b,c and Fig. 2).  \n \nThese results suggest that the crucial factor determining DF\u2019s performance is not \nthe task (i.e. perceptual versus visuomotor) but the spatial mode (i.e. allocentric \nversus egocentric). Differences in the required spatial mode can also explain the \n\u201cperception\/action\u201d dissociations found for object size. In this case size \nestimation (perception) is compared with grasping (visuomotor), and again DF is \nbetter in the visuomotor task9. However, for size estimation the relative size is \nused, whereas conventional grasping uses the object\u2019s absolute size. In fact as \nsoon as the relative size of an object\u2019s dimensions is made relevant for the \ngrasping, DF\u2019s performance becomes impaired11. Thus, characterizing DF\u2019s \ndeficit as an impairment of object-centred or scene-based representation of \nposition and size can account for the \u201cperception\/action\u201d dissociations and in \naddition correctly predicts that DF\u2019s perceptual performance is preserved in an \negocentric condition.  \n \nHowever, there might be an alternative explanation for DF\u2019s improved \nperformance in the egocentric perceptual task. Let\u2019s assume that DF suffers from \nsimultanagnosia. In this case DF would find it difficult to compare two or more \nvisual objects, but would find it easier to compare a visual with a non-visual \nobject. This could explain why DF\u2019s performance in the egocentric condition, \nwhere a non-visual signal indicates the reference position, is better than in the \nallocentric condition with a visual reference signal. However, in a test for \nsimultanagnosia using the set of stimuli also used in the allocentric perceptual \ntask, DF showed no sign of simultanagnosia (Supplementary Note). It is also \nimportant to note that the simultanagnosia interpretation would not defuse the \nchallenge posed by our findings to the perception\/action model. If we accept that \nthe simultanagnosia interpretation explains the dissociation between the \n\u201callocentric\u201d and \u201cegocentric\u201d condition in the perceptual tasks, we will also have \nto accept that it can explain the similar dissociation found in the visuomotor \ntasks. This would bring us to a conclusion which is similar to ours, namely that \nthe crucial factor in determining DF\u2019s behaviour is how the target information is \npresented and not which behavioural response is required.  \n \nThe finding of DF\u2019s normal performance in the egocentric perceptual task is also \nsurprising in light of the recently presented argument that the perceptual \nrepresentation of visual objects can only be achieved within an allocentric \nframework12. The present results show that egocentric spatial positions can be \nperceptually represented even when allocentric coding is impaired, and therefore \nsuggest that this argument12 does not extend beyond objects to positions.  \n \nThe present findings challenge the conventional interpretation of \n\u201cperception\/action\u201d dissociations in DF, and thereby undermine an important, but \nnot the only source of support for the perception\/action model. Optic ataxia has \nbeen presented as another, complementary example of a perception\/action \ndissociation with action impaired and perception preserved1,13. However, this \ninterpretation of optic ataxia was disputed7. It was argued that a more \nappropriate characterization of optic ataxia should emphasize the distinction \nbetween central and peripheral vision rather than the distinction between \nperception and action7. Other studies have shown that optic ataxia affects only \nspecific aspects of visuomotor behaviour14 and egocentric coding15. It thus \nappears that neither the perception\/action nor the allocentric\/egocentric \ndistinction can provide a satisfactory account of this complex disorder. \nIn conclusion, DF\u2019s performance was impaired in allocentric and preserved in \negocentric conditions for both perceptual and motor tasks. These findings are \ninconsistent with a perception\/action explanation of DF\u2019s behaviour, and \ntherefore undermine one of the main pillars of the perception\/action model.  \n \nAcknowledgements. \nI thank DF for her participation.
