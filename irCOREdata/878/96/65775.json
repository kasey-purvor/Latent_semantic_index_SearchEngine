Temperature change-induced optical path length imbalance between\ntwo single slab waveguide modes provides the primary mechanism for detection. The waveguide\nmode output field phase change differences are encoded in shifts in the far field interference pattern.\nTo illustrate the method, the thermo-optic coefficients of two In1\u2212xGaxAsyP1\u2212y quaternary alloys,\n1.3Q and 1.15Q, are measured at a wavelength of 1.55 \u0001m and at a center temperature of 25.2 \u00b0C.\nTheir ratio is in excellent agreement with previous work, in accordance with optical dispersion\nmodels. \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics. \u0003DOI: 10.1063\/1.2795340\u0004\nAn understanding of the thermal behavior of guided\nwave photonic devices is crucial; whether one is designing a\ndevice where this behavior provides the device functionality1\nor whether it is a problem to be managed.2 The intrinsic\nthermal response of a device \u0001as opposed to extrinsic sources\ndue to the packaging\u0002 can be modeled accurately provided\nthat the thermo-optic coefficients of the materials comprising\nthe device are known. For many common optical materials\nsuch as silica lithium niobate, silicon, and other semiconduc-\ntor crystals such as the III-V binaries \u0001InP, GaAs, etc.\u0002, these\ncoefficients are now described well by the pioneering disper-\nsion model of Ghosh.3 Experimental verification of thermo-\noptic coefficients, however, requires suitable sample geom-\netries such as a prism4 or etalon5 or integrated optical\nwaveguide device,6 and in part for this reason, there is a\nscarcity \u0001essentially an absence\u0002 of the reported thermo-optic\ncoefficients of materials of the quaternary III-V compound\nsemiconductors. These alloys are not formed as bulk crystals\nbut as thin epitaxial layers by metal organic vapor phase\nepitaxy \u0001MOVPE\u0002 growth on the binary alloy crystal wafer\nsubstrate. Despite the obviously successful development of\nvital optoelectronic components \u0001for example, diode lasers\nand photodetectors\u0002 that use quaternary materials, designers\nwould benefit from having access to such data and we pro-\nvide here a device-based method that is relatively simple to\nimplement that allows the measurement, in principle, of any\ndesired III-V alloy system across wide ranges of tempera-\ntures and wavelengths. We report the thermo-optic coeffi-\ncient for two InGaAsP compositions at the wavelength center\nof the ITU C band \u00020=1.55 \u0001m and at a center temperature\nof 25.2 \u00b0C.\nWe previously demonstrated an InP\/ InGaAsP dual slab\nwaveguide unbalanced interferometer designed to detect pi-\ncometer level changes in C-band laser wavelength.7,8 The\ninterferometer consists very simply of five epitaxial layers of\nalternately low and high refractive indices \u0001here, InP and\nInGaAsP, respectively\u0002 fabricated on suitable absorbing lay-\ners and on a heavily doped InP substrate \u0001see Table I and the\ninset of Fig. 1\u0002. End fire of an oversized optical field into the\nwaveguide sample excites both single slab modes with equal\nefficiency. All nonguided light is either absorbed into the\nlower layers or scattered through the device surface.9 At the\ndevice output, the two modes diffract into the far field at the\noutput plane where they form a clear interference pattern\nanalogous to Young\u2019s fringes \u0001Fig. 1\u0002. The spatial intensity\ndistribution of the fringe pattern provides information on the\nrelative phase difference, between the \u201cupper\u201d \u0001u\u0002 and\n\u201clower\u201d \u0001l\u0002 waveguide fields at the output plane of the de-\nvice, reflecting the difference in effective refractive index,\nNu\u0001l\u0002 between the modes.Thickness and compositional differ-\nences between the two guiding layers produce a difference in\nthe effective thermo-optic coefficient dNu\u0001l\u0002 \/dT of the two\nmodes. As the temperature changes \u0003T, the net effect is an\noutput phase change difference \u0003\u0004 related to the effective\nindex change between the modes and change in sample\nlength due to thermal expansion given by\n\u0003\u0004 =\n2\u0005\n\u00020\nL\u0003T\u0003dNu\/dT \u2212 dNl\/dT + \u0006\u0001Nu \u2212 Nl\u0002\n+ \u0006\u0003T\u0001dNu\/dT \u2212 dNl\/dT\u0002\u0004 , \u00011\u0002\nwhere L is the length of the interferometer chip and \u0006 is the\na\u0002Electronic mail: g.h.cross@durham.ac.uk\nTABLE I.

This layer is separated from the lower\ninterferometer waveguide mode such that the absorption loss\nis less than 0.1 dB\/cm. To prevent direct transmission\nthrough the substrate, a Si-doped \u0001N=1\u00071018 cm\u22123\u0002 InP\nlayer is deposited on top of a highly absorbing S-doped \u0001N\n=5\u00071018 cm\u22123\u0002 InP substrate. These precautions ensure that\nthe output light from the device end facet is from waveguid-\ning modes only and allow for a highly visible fringe pattern\nto be formed in the far field.\nThe interference pattern falls onto a 256 pixel InGaAs\nlinear array \u0001Hamamatsu C8061\u0002 and data are collected via a\ncomputer interface. Pixel voltages are read into a discrete\nFourier transform algorithm to produce a relative phase dif-\nference value for the two source fields. The calculated phase\nvalues are insensitive to input optical power fluctuations, and\nthe overall noise floor of the device is \u00b11 mrad.\nThe temperature was stepped across a full range of\n400 mK \u000125.0\u201325.4 \u00b0C\u0002, and at each step, a dwell time of\ngreater than 15 min was included to allow the equipment and\nsample temperature to settle. Mean values of the response\nwere obtained from repeated measurements. The mean\nsensitivity to temperature change around 25 \u00b0C for the 1.3Q\ninterferometer chip \u0003structure \u0001a\u0002\u0004 at a fixed wavelength of\n1.55 \u00b5m was measured as \u0003\u0004TE\/\u0003T=\u22122.705\u00b10.15 rad K\u22121\nand \u0003\u0004TM\/\u0003T=\u22122.7114\u00b10.15 rad K\u22121. For the 1.3Q \/1.15Q\ndesign \u0003structure \u0001b\u0002\u0004, the mean thermal sensitivities found\nwere \u0003\u0004TE\/\u0003T=\u22123.240\u00b10.23 rad K\u22121 and \u0003\u0004TM\/\u0003T\n=\u22123.179\u00b10.13 rad K\u22121.\nThe thermo-optic coefficients, calculated using these\nvalues in Eqs. \u00015\u0002 and \u00016\u0002, are shown in Table III. They lie\nabove the thermo-optic coefficients of InP \u00011.95\n\u000710\u22124 K\u22121\u0002 and GaAs \u00012.35\u000710\u22124 K\u22121\u0002 \u0001Ref. 5\u0002 and, as\nwould be expected because of the dispersion effects,3 the\nlower band gap material has a larger thermo-optic coeffi-\ncient. Although there is little to compare with in the litera-\nture, the ratio between the two coefficients is, however, in\nexcellent agreement with the results of a previous device\nstudy13 which reported a ratio of 0.81 between the thermo-\noptic coefficients of 1.1Q and 1.3Q.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated a method for de-\ntermining the thermo-optic coefficients of MOVPE-\ndeposited InGaAsP layers to a high accuracy. Very simple\ndevice structures, requiring only epitaxial multilayer deposi-\ntion and no lithography, are described. The present studies\nare limited to reporting values at a wavelength of 1.55 \u0001m\nand at a temperature of 25 \u00b0C, but this technique could be\nreadily extended to cover the wavelength and temperature\nspace required by device engineers.\nThis work was supported by the UK EPSRC through a\nstudentship to David Cassidy and with epilayer fabrication at\nthe EPSRC National III-V Centre in Sheffield, UK.\n1C.
