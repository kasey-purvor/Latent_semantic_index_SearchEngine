Introduction \nIt has been estimated that 60% of all humans have been affected by gene mutation in their lifetime. This rather \ndramatically demonstrates the importance of increasing demand for new high-throughput methods for mutation \ndetection.  \n \nA variety of methods are currently used to assess the mutation status of individual tumours (Nollau et al., 1997). \nTP53 gene is mutated in most types of human cancers and is one of the most studied genes in cancer research. \nMoreover, many studies have suggested that TP53 mutations have prognostic importance and sometimes are \ndeterminant in the response of tumours to therapy. The role of TP53 as an important early diagnostic marker and its \nmutation spectrum have emerged and traditional methods for detecting point mutations as well as new approaches \nbased on biosensors and DNA chips for detecting and recognizing mutations of TP53 have been developed. This \nhas been reviewed very recently by Jiang et al. (2004).  \n \nAmong traditional methods for molecular diagnosis and also for TP53, distinction is made between point mutation \nscanning and screening technologies. Scanning technologies aim at finding unknown mutations in candidate or \nknown disease genes, such as direct DNA sequencing. Screening techniques aim at finding known mutations, \npreferably with high throughput (Jiang et al., 2004). For example, denaturing high-performance liquid \n 2\nchromatography (DHPLC) (Narayanaswami et al., 2002; Gross et al., 2001), Single-strand conformation \npolymorphism (SSCP) (Miyajima et al., 2001; Ru et al., 2000), and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis \n(DGGE) (Sheffield et al., 1989; Van Orsouw et al., 1998). However, some of these approaches are time consuming \nand require highly skilled labor, while some are less sensitive or use expensive equipment. \n \nIn recent years, a new trend for the detection of TP53 mutations has aimed at label free, high sensitivity and \nspecificity, real-time and rapid detection. Biosensors, in particular DNA-based sensors, and gene chips are of \nconsiderable recent interest due to their tremendous promise for obtaining sequence-specific information in a \nfaster, simpler and cheaper manner compared to traditional hybridization assays. Different transduction principles \nhave been employed for TP53 DNA detection including electrochemical, piezoelectric and optical (SPR) \ntechniques. All these systems are based on the hybridization reaction between a probe immobilized on the \ntransducer surface, which may be either an electrode, in particular a carbon paste (Palacek et al., 1998) or a gold \nelectrode (Wang et al., 1997; Miyahara et al., 2002), a quartz crystal coated with gold (Wang, et al., 1997; \nWittung-Shafshede et al., 2000) or a sensor chip [Nilsson et al., 1997;  Nilsson et al., 1999) made of glass with \nevaporated gold on one side in the case of SPR sensing. Most of the papers relating to TP53 detection in the \nliterature use only standard solutions containing synthetic oligonucleotides, respectively complementary and \ncontaining a mutation (mismatch: point mutation in one base). Only Miyahara et al. and Nilsson et al. deal with \nreal samples consisting of PCR amplified DNA from blood or tissues, in particular, from microdissected tumor \nbiopsies, containing the target sequence able to hybridize with the immobilized probe.  \n \nIn the current work, we report a method for detecting TP53 mutations using a new portable Surface Plasmon \nResonance-based Biosensor. In particular, we employed the inexpensive, portable and commercially available \n 3\ninstrument, SPREETATM SPR. The system is based on the hybridisation reaction between the immobilised probe \nand its complementary or mismatched sequence in solution. The probe immobilisation is based on the coupling of \nthiol-derivatised oligonucleotide probes (Probe-C6-SH) to bare gold sensor surfaces. This procedure has been \nsuccessfully employed with SPR DNA-based sensing in previous work by our group using both the SpreetaTM and \n  Biacore XTM instruments  (Wang et al., 2004a; Wang et al., 2004b). The system was optimized using synthetic \noligonucleotides and the main analytical parameters of the sensor  (selectivity, sensitivity, reproducibility, analysis \ntime etc) were studied in detail. The system was applied to complementary and a mismatch sequences (C\u2192A) \ncorresponding to codon 248 of the TP53 gene.  DNA extracted from \"normal\u201d wild type cell line (Jurkat) \ncontaining the fully complementary sequence and DNA extracted from cell line (Molt 4) carrying that mutation \nwas also tested prior amplification by PCR. \n \n2. Experimental \n2.1. Apparatus and reagents \nFor all the experiments the SPR device SpreetaTM (Texas Instruments, Inc., United States of America) and a bare \ngold SpreetaTM sensor were used. All experiments were conducted at a flow rate of 5\u00b5l\/min and 25\u00b0C. \n \n6-mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Milan, Italy). Other reagents for the buffers \nwere purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).  The composition of the buffers used for the experiments is as \nfollows: \nImmobilisation solution: KH2PO4 1M, pH 3.8. \nHybridisation buffer: NaCl 150 mM, Na2HPO4 20 mM, EDTA 0.1 mM, Tween 20 0.005%, pH 7.4. \n \n 4\nOligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma-Genosys (Cambridge, UK). The base sequences of the \n5\u2019-functionalised probes (26-mer), and  26-mer synthetic target oligonucleotides, are described below: \nThiolated Probe (TP53):  5\u2019 HS-(CH2)6- TGG GCG GCA TGA ACC GGA GGC CCA TC 3\u2019 \nTarget (TP53):  5\u2019-GAT GGG CCT CCG GTT CAT GCC GCC CA-3\u2019 (complementary to  probe TP53); \nThe relative one base mismatch oligonucleotides (at the codon of interest (248), underlined in probe sequence) and \na non-complementary strand (negative control) were also used.  \n \n2.2 Samples \nDNA extraction from the mutated (Molt 4) and normal (Jurkat) cell lines was performed. Molt 4 is a cell line \nderived from a patient (human male 19 years old) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in relapse, and carrying the \nmutation of interest  at codon 248 of the TP53. The concentration of the extracted DNA material was determined with \nfluorescence assay by using Picogreen \u00ae dye (TD-700 Fluorometor, Turner Biosystems from Analytical Control, \nMilan, Italy). \n \nA 236bp DNA fragment containing the target sequence TP53 was amplified by using the functionalised sense \n(5\u2019-CTTGCCACAGGTCTCCCCAA-3\u2019) and antisense (5\u2019-AGGGGTCAGCGGCAAGCAGA-3\u2019) primers \n(MWG-BIOTECH, Florence, Italy). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 4min, 56\u00b0C for 1min and 72\u00b0C \nfor 2 min, 40 cycles.  All PCR experiments were conducted using a Perkin Elmer Thermal cycler (model 9600) \n(Perkin Elmer, Shelton, USA). \n \nThe DNA concentration of the amplified products was also determined with fluorescence assay by using Picogreen \n\u00ae dye (TD-700 Fluorometor, Turner Biosystems from Analytical Control, Milan, Italy). Screening of the PCR \n 5\nproducts was performed by gel electrophoresis and visualized through a U.V. transilluminator.  The control \nsolution (blank) contained all the PCR reagents except the DNA template. \n \n2.3 PCR samples treatment \nPrior to SPR testing, the amplicons obtained from PCR need to be pre-treated to obtain single-stranded DNA for \nhybridization with the immobilized probe. We first referred to the thermal denaturation method, which is well \ndocumented in many previous studies (Miyahara  et al., 200; Wang  et al., 1997; Wittung-Shafshede  et al., 2000;  \nNilsson et al., 1997; 1999). It is based on a 5 minute incubation step at 95\u00b0C followed by one minute on ice.  \n \nMoreover, a new denaturation approach (High temperature denaturation with primers method) was used. This \nmethod was optimized (Wang et al., 2004b) and found to be a simple and useful way to obtain single-stranded \nDNA for hybridization coupled with a symmetric PCR amplification system. The principle of this method relies on \nthe use of small (20 bases) oligonucleotides (in this case corresponding to PCR reaction primers) added to the \ndenaturating mixture. These oligonucleotides are complementary to some sequences on the strand which hybridise \nthe immobilized probe, but are positioned laterally and do not overlap with the portion forming the complex with \nthe probe. By the interaction between the thermally separated DNA strands and these oligonucleotides, \nre-association between dsDNA strands of PCR amplicons is prevented and surface hybridization can occur (Figure \n1). The effect of the oligonucleotide binding is to prevent re-annealing of the denatured DNA strands before they \ncome into contact with the sensor surface. The whole denaturation procedure was combined with sense and \nantisense primers. It comprised 5 minutes incubation at 95\u00b0C and then 1 minute incubation at a certain temperature \ndetermined as suitable for primer linking in the PCR procedure. These oligonucleotides were chosen on the basis \nof the particular sequence of the PCR fragment to be analyzed. In this case the same oligonucleotide used as \n 6\nprimers in the PCR step were employed also in the denaturating step. \n \n2.4 Immobilization method \nA direct immobilization method based on the formation of gold-thiolated DNA probes was used. 1). The gold \nsensor surface was first cleaned with ethanol, and then further cleaned with a solution of 30% \nNH3\/30%H2O2\/MilliQ H2O in ratio 1\/1\/5 for 10 min, then surface was rinsed with MilliQ water and allowed to dry. \n2). The Spreeta sensor was inserted into the instrument socket. The thiolated probe (1\u00b5M, in KH2PO4 pH 3.8) \nsolution was then allowed to flow in the system for 2 hours, by connecting the inlet of the cell to a peristaltic pump \n(Gilson), then the probe was replaced by MCH (6- mercapto-1-hexanol) solution which was left in contact with the \nsurface for 1 hour (in the dark). 3). Once the immobilisation procedure was ended, the surface was finally washed \nby running the hybridization buffer for 4 hours.   \n \n2.5 Hybridization reaction \nThe DNA hybridisation measurement cycle comprised injection of the target sequence, which was left in contact \nfor nine minutes to allow hybridisation, washing of the surface for three minutes with hybridization buffer to \nremove the unbound DNA material and regeneration with 2.5 mM HCl for at least for two minutes to return to the \nbaseline (flow rate is 5\u00b5l\/min, 25\u00b0C). The analytical signal, reported as Refractive Index (RI), is represented by the \nvalue observed before (baseline) and after the hybridisation reaction, once the surface had been washed by the \nbuffer. All the measurements were performed in the same solution (hybridisation buffer). \n \n3. Results and discussion \nPreliminary experiments were conducted with the 25-mer oligonucleotides to verify the ability of the sensor to \n 7\ngenerating a specific and reproducible signal when in contact with the fully complementary sequence solution. \nInitially, the probe was immobilised on the sensor surface and the operating conditions optimised.   \n \n3.1. Sensor optimization \nThe  TP53 thiolated probe was successfully immobilised on the sensor surface and this was in agreement with \nour previous work conducted with different thiolated probes [Wang et al., 2004a; 2004b). This \nimmobilisation procedure decreases significantly the immobilisation time without loss of sensor \nperformance [Wang et al., 2004]. The total immobilisation time, starting from a bare gold sensor surfaces was \nof 3 hours, which is much less than the 5 days required to modify the chip with thiol\/carboxylated dextran \nbased on streptavidin binding to biotinylated probes [Mariotti et al., 2002; Minunni et al., 2001; Giakoumaki  \net al., 2003).  \n \nThe sensor system was first optimized with synthetic oligonucleotides and the performance of the SPR-based \nDNA biosensor resulting from direct coupling of thiol-derivatised DNA probes onto gold chip was studied in \nterms of the main analytical parameters, i.e specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, stability, analysis time, \netc.  \n \nThe specificity of the system was first evaluated by injecting into the system 1 \u00b5M 26-mer solution of \nnon-complementary sequence used as negative control. No detectable hybridization signal was obtained \n[signal < 0.1RI(E-05)], showing that the sensor was specific. \n \nThe reproducibility of the measurement was estimated using the same concentration (1\u00b5M) of TP53 target for nine \n 8\ndifferent cycles of hybridization\/regeneration on the same sensor in one day, the average value obtained was \n12.1E-05 RI with SD=0.8E-05 and CV=7%.  \n \nTo optimize the regeneration procedure, different concentrations of HCl and NaOH were tested. Among them, HCl \nshowed higher regeneration capacity at the optimised concentration of 2.5mM. The single stranded probe was \nsuccessfully regenerated by a two minute treatment with 2.5mM HCl and was then ready for a new hybridisation \ncycle (data not shown). Such treatment could be performed up to 50 times without affecting the hybridization \nefficiency of the immobilized probe. We checked the hybridization signal with the same concentration (1\u00b5M) of \nTP53 complementary target oligonucleotide after every 10 hybridization\/regeneration cycles and the results are \nlisted in Table 1. A decrease in the hybridisation signal can be observed at around 60 measurements cycles. \n \nThe stability of the sensor system was also studied, by monitoring the baseline value after each measurement cycle. \nThis was estimated first, by comparing the baseline signal over different hybridisation cycles. In particular, the \ndifference between the maximum and the minimum baseline was found to be only value3.2E-05 RI, indicating \ngood stability of the system. \n \nThe reproducibility of the measurements between different sensors (N=5) was estimated, comparing the \nhybridisation signals obtained with the same concentration (1 \u00b5M) of the complementary target oligonucleotide \nwith the different surfaces on which the same probe had been immobilised.  At least 3 replicates of this \nmeasurement for each surface (n\u22653) were performed. The results are shown in Figure 2. The average hybridisation \nvalue obtained with 1\u00b5M complementary target oligonucleotide, calculated over 5 sensors, was 12.4E-5 RI, with \nSD=1E-5 RI and CV%=8, indicating a very good. reproducibility of the measurements on different surfaces. This \n 9\nresult confirms that the direct coupling of probes by self-assembly of terminally thio-labeled oligonucleotides onto \ngold surfaces was a suitable immobilization method for SPR-based sensors. Reproducibility of the immobilisation \nstep was also good: the average signal  over 5 different  immobilisation events was 15,294E-5 with SD=0,01E-3 \nRI. \n \nA calibration curve (0-2\u00b5M) of TP53 complementary target was produced and the results are shown in Figure 3A. \nEach concentration tested represents at least 3 measurements (n\u22653). A linear region up to 0.5\u00b5M was found (Figure \n3B) and the experimental detection limit was 50nM. However, a calculated detection limit of 10 nM was obtained \n(calculated as the concentration which would generate a signal which was 3 times the standard deviation of the \nbaseline signal). The difference between the calculated and the experimental detection limit could be due to the \ninstrument or the whole experimental procedure. \n \nFurther experiments were performed to compare the hybridization responses with fully complementary \noligonucleotides, mismatch oligonucleotides and a mixture solution containing 50% of both the oligonucleotides. \nThe 100% fully complementary, 50% mismatchand-50% fully complementary and  100% mismatch, reflect the \npossible genomes that can be found in patients. The hybridisation time, in this series of experiments, was \ndecreased down to 2 minutes (instead of 9 min), to perform all the 3 different calibration curves on the same, \nfreshly prepared sensor, on the same day.  Results are shown in Figure 4. The applied concentration range was \n0-10\u00b5M, and samples were tested in triplicate (n=3).  The lower hybridisation signals observed here with the fully \ncomplementary sample, compared to the values observed in Figure 2 are due to the much shorter hybridisation \ntimes used here (2 minutes vs 9). A decreased signal in the presence of the mismatch was always observed \n(concentration > 0.5\u00b5M). The decrease % is calculated comparing the signal observed with the 100% fully \n 10\ncomplementary sample and the ones obtained with the 100% mismatch or 50% samples. A significant decrease is \nobserved at concentrations higher than 0.5\u00b5M. An average decrease (calculated in the concentration range 2-10\u00b5M) \nof 21E-5RI with SD= 3E-3 for the 50% samples and of 29E-5 with SD=2E-5 for the 100% mismatch sample was \nfound, respectively. In particular the highest decrease for the 50% sample was observed at 4\u00b5M (23%) and for the \n100% mismatch at 2\u00b5M (32%). The data obtained showed that the hybridization response variations \ncorresponding to the complementary oligonucleotides, the mismatch and the mixture solution were influenced by \nthe concentrations used. The  difference in the hybridization responses increased at higher concentrations.  This \nresult was important for identifying the concentration of DNA suitable for use in the assays with PCR amplified \nDNA. \n \n3.2. Detection of hybridization with PCR-amplified samples \nThe system was finally applied to complementary and the mismatch sequences (C\u2192A) of codon 248 of the TP53 \ngene of living cells. DNA extracted from normal cell line (Jurkat) containing the fully complementary sequence \nand from cell line (Molt 4) carrying that mutation was first amplified by PCR and then tested on the sensor.   \n \nThe amplicons obtained by PCR have a double helix structure and the two strands should be separated (denatured) \nto allow the hybridization with the probe immobilized on the sensor surface. The PCR-amplified samples were \ndenaturated first with the thermal denaturation method, since this method was well documented in many previous \nstudies [Wang et al., 2004a; 2004b; Mariotti et al., 2002; Minunni et al., 2001; Giakoumaki et al., 2003). It \ninvolved a 5 minute incubation step at 95\u00b0C and then cooling on ice for 1 minute. However, SPR testing showed no \ndetectable hybridization shift (data not shown). This was attributed to the re-annealing of the denatured DNA \nstrands before coming in contact with the sensor surface, as also demonstrated by Mariotti and co-workers. \n 11\n To overcome this problem, it was necessary to use a new treatment (described in paragraph 2.3) for the PCR \nsamples before injection in the instrument. The denaturating conditions have been previously optimized (Wang et \nal., 2004b) using symmetrically amplified PCR. The method is very simple and it is based on high temperature \ndenaturation (95\u00b0C) followed by a 1 minute incubation step with oligonucleotides at a suitable temperature.  The \noligonucleotides (20 bases) chosen in this work were exactly the primers used in the corresponding PCR reaction \nto amplify the TP53 fragment. The one-minute incubation was performed at 56\u00b0C, which is the suitable \ntemperature to use for these specific primers linking in the relative PCR reaction.  The first high temperature \ntreatment (5 min) dissociates the PCR fragments (dsDNA) into the ssDNA complementary strands and then these \noligonucleotides (primers) bind them leaving the target sequence free to hybridise the immobilised probe. The \neffect of the oligonucleotides binding is to prevent the re-annealing denatured DNA strands before coming in \ncontact with the sensor surface.  \n \nThe hybridization shifts obtained from the testing of PCR-amplified sample after applying this new denaturing \ntreatment are shown in Figure 5. The sample was diluted in hybridization buffer up to a final concentration of 0.15 \n\u00b5M. PCR blanks, containing all the reagents of the PCR mixture except the template DNA and also containing the \noligonucleotides for denaturation procedure, were tested to check any non-specific effect and negligible response \n(3.33E-6 RIU) was obtained. The normal wild type sample (Jurkat) resulted in a measurable shift of 7.57E-05 RIU \nwith S.D=8.39E-06, and CV=11%. The sample carrying the mutation at codon 248 (Molt4) showed an average \nsignal of about 5.00E-05 RIU with S.D=2.00E-06 and CV=4%. Comparing the signal observed with PCR \namplified sample obtained with the fully complementary wild type sequence with the one observed with the \nmutated sample, a decrease of about 34% could be observed in the case of the second one (100% mismatch). \n 12\n Negative control (GM maize PCR sample) was also tested using the same concentration (0.15 \u00b5M) and the \nsame denaturation procedure. The signal from the negative control was very low (average value was \n8.57E-06 RIU with S.D=7.02E-07 and CV=8%). These results clearly demonstrate the ability of the sensor to \ndetect TP53 gene point mutations. A great improvement was obtained by coupling SPR-based devices with \nthe new denaturation method applied to PCR amplicons (Wang et al., 2004a; 2004b). After the interaction of \nthe surfaces with the PCR-amplified samples, the regeneration with HCl 2.5 mM, which had been used for \nthe experiments with the synthetic oligonucleotides, was not sufficient (data not shown). Higher \nconcentrations (5, 10 and 25 mM) of HCl and NaOH were tested to find the optimal regeneration conditions; \nNaOH 25 mM (treatment for 1 minute) proved to be the most efficient. With this regeneration procedure, the \nsensor could be used up to 50 times, using both oligonucleotides and PCR real samples (data not shown). \n \n3. Conclusions \nWe have successfully applied a portable Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) biosensor to point mutation detection. \nThe system is based on hybridization detection between a DNA probe immobilised on the sensor surface and the \ntarget sequence in solution. The commercially available instrument SPREETATM SPR-EVM-BT was used for the \nanalysis of PCR-amplified samples to detect TP53 mutation.  \n \nProbe immobilization was achieved by direct coupling of thiolated probes on gold sensor surfaces. The SPR-based \nsensor developed showed high specificity, high sensitivity, good reproducibility and good stability.  \n \nIt has been demonstrated that the biosensor was suitable for DNA hybridization detection both with synthetic \n 13\noligonucleotides and PCR-amplified real samples. The sensor system was able to distinguish between sequences \ndiffering only in one base both using standard solutions of synthetic oligonucleotides (26 bases) or real samples \n(236 bp). \n \nA new, fast and improved denaturing procedure was employed for the analysis of real samples consisting of \nPCR-amplified DNA , which is based on the use of small oligonucleotides coupled to a high temperature thermal \nPCR sample treatment. This new sample treatment combined with the developed DNA-based SPR biosensor \nallowed the analysis of gene mutation in real samples and demonstarted the potential of the method for routine \nanalysis. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Dr. Lucia Mosiello, Enea-Casaccia, Italy, for cultivating Jurkat and Molt 4 cell lines and for DNA \nextraction.
