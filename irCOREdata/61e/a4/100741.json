INTRODUCTION\nSingle-nucleon knockout reactions, initiated by secondary\nbeams of short-lived exotic nuclei at fragmentation beam\nenergies, have significant cross sections and have been shown\nto be a powerful tool for studying the structure of light- and\nmedium-mass nuclei [1,2]. In almost all cases the reaction\npopulates a number of hole states in the reaction residue\nleading to sizable cross sections to several discrete, bound\nresidue excited states. The knockout method is therefore at its\nmost powerful when measurements are made of coincidences\nbetween the reaction residues and their decay \u03b3 rays to obtain\npartial cross sections to one or more such final states.\nTo date, essentially all calculations have made the spectator-\ncore approximation [3,4] in which it is assumed that the\ninternal degrees of freedom of these reaction residues are\ninert and are not dynamically excited or deexcited during\nthe reaction. This allows a direct structural connection to be\nmade between the measured partial cross sections and the wave\nfunction overlaps between the projectile initial state and the\nmeasured residue final states. The importance of dynamical\ncore state excitation effects, associated with single-particle\nexcitations or the deformation degree of freedom, remain to\nbe fully clarified. Calculations of single-particle-like inelastic\nterms, in Ref. [4], suggested that single-nucleon excitation\ncross sections were small. This view was supported by an\nestimate of the effects on the stripping cross section [5].\nConversely, an earlier estimate was made of collective, core\nrotational excitation in the case of neutron knockout from\n11Be [6], where a contribution from 0+ \u2192 2+ state inelastic\nexcitation of 10Be was significant and was needed to explain\nan enhanced 10Be(2+) final state partial cross section. There\nthe changes were anticipated as arising principally from an\nenhanced elastic breakup component.\nIn this article we perform a first investigation of the\neffects of the dynamical excitation and also reorientation\n\u2217Electronic address: j.tostevin@surrey.ac.uk\nof an assumed quadrupole-deformed projectile core on both\nthe elastic breakup and the stripping components of the\ninclusive single-nucleon knockout cross sections. A closely\nrelated analysis, of the effects of deformation of the core and\nof the removed nucleon\u2019s single-particle state, was reported\npreviously by Sakharuk and Zelevinsky [7]. Sakharuk and\nZelevinsky calculated the cross section from the stripping\nmechanism only, using the strong-coupling (Nilsson basis)\napproach. They found the associated deformation effects on\nthe nucleon stripping cross section to be relatively small.\nWe consider here nucleon knockout from weakly bound\nprojectiles where the breakup mechanism is expected to play\nan important role. Such systems have been reasonably well\nmodeled (e.g., Ref. [8] and references therein) as bound\ncoupled-channels eigenstates of the deformed core with the\nloosely bound neutron. Unlike the deformed-basis analysis of\nRef. [7], our approach uses a spherical single-particle basis. In\nSec. II we discuss the generalization of the reaction formalism\nrequired to incorporate the core deformation degree of freedom\nand in Sec. III the treatment of the core- and nucleon-target\nS matrices. Section IV then presents the model results for\napplications to neutron knockout reactions from 11Be and 17C\nsecondary beams on a 9Be target. Section V contains our\nconcluding remarks.\nII. DEFORMED-CORE EIKONAL FORMULATION\nSingle-nucleon knockout reactions are considered where\nonly the projectile residue (but not its final state) is detected\nfollowing removal of a neutron from the projectile. The two\nincoherent reaction mechanisms involved are then neutron\nstripping, the neutron exciting the target, and diffractive\nbreakup of the projectile, the target remaining in its ground\nstate. We use a coordinate system in which the z axis is parallel\nto the incident projectile beam direction (Fig. 1).\nWe use the eikonal reaction model, the first step of which\nis to make an adiabatic treatment [9] of the internal degrees\nof freedom of the projectile. In the more usual treatment, of a\ntwo-body projectile with a spherical core, the internal degrees\n0556-2813\/2005\/71(6)\/064608(7)\/$23.00 064608-1 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society\nP.

Schematic of the deformed-core plus neutron projectile\nsystem incident on a spherical target indicating the angular momen-\ntum quantum numbers, the core orientation \u0001\u0302, and the center of mass\nimpact parameter b.\nof freedom are the position coordinate vector r of the removed\nneutron relative to the core and the internal state of the core.\nThese are assumed fixed for the (short) duration of the (fast)\ncollision between the projectile with the target. In the present\ndeformed core case, both r and the orientation of the deformed\ncore, \u0001\u0302, are assumed frozen. The model is nonperturbative and\ntreats dissociation of the projectile and excitation, deexcitation,\nand reorientation of the core degrees of freedom to all orders.\nThe application of this frozen-orientation approximation to\ncalculations of the more restricted problem, of deformed core-\ntarget elastic and inelastic scattering and to calculations of\nreaction cross sections, can be found in Refs. [10,11].\nWe thus calculate the cross sections for neutron removal\nand the population of all final states of the assumed rotational\nband of the core. Although, at the fragmentation beam energies\nof interest, these cross sections are expected be dominated by\nthe cross sections to the lowest 0+ and 2+ core final states [10],\nthe model makes no such restriction.\nThe model system is represented in Fig. 1. The core\norientation is described by the spherical polar angles \u0001\u0302 =\n(\u03b1, \u03b2) of its symmetry axis. The position of the neutron\nrelative to the center-of-mass (c.m.) of the core, of mass\nAc, is expressed in terms of its cylindrical polar coordinates\nr = (br , zr ) \u2261 (br, \u03c6r , zr ) with r =\n\u221a\nb2r + z2r . Similarly, the\npositions of the center-of-mass of the core and the neutron\nrelative to the target are Ri = (bi , zi) \u2261 (bi, \u03c6i, zi), i = c, n,\nwith bc and bn the core and neutron-target impact parameters.\nThe position of the center-of-mass of the composite projectile\nrelative to the target is R = (b, Z) = (b, \u03c6,Z) and hence\nbn = b + Ac\nAc + 1 br , bc = b \u2212\n1\nAc + 1 br . (1)\nWe can take the coordinate x axis in the direction of b, thus\n\u03c6 = 0.\nA. Eikonal model cross sections\nWe formulate the neutron removal cross section within\nthe eikonal model. The probability that the neutron survives\nthe collision with the target at an impact parameter bn, in the\nelastic channel, is given by |Sn(bn)|2, the square modulus of\nits elastic S matrix describing the interaction with the target.\nIts absorption probability is therefore 1 \u2212 |Sn(bn)|2. Similarly,\nthe probability of the deformed core surviving the collision\nat an impact parameter bc with orientation \u0001\u0302 is |Sc(bc, \u0001\u0302)|2.\nThe deformation of the core now means that this S matrix is a\nfunction of bc and \u02c6bc \u00b7 \u0001\u0302 and will couple the states \u0005ImI (\u0001\u0302)\nof the core.\nWe denote by \u0006JmJ (r, \u0001\u0302) the ground-state wave function\nof the projectile that describes a deformed core plus loosely\nbound neutron system, with total angular momentum J and\nprojection mJ . Generalizing Refs. [3,4] to the deformed core\ncase, the integrated cross section \u03c3strip for single-neutron\nstripping is now the following:\n\u03c3strip = 12J + 1\n\u222b\ndb\n\u2211\nmJ\n\u2329\n\u0006JmJ (r, \u0001\u0302)\n\u2223\u2223\nO1(b, br , \u0001\u0302)\n\u2223\u2223\u0006JmJ (r, \u0001\u0302)\u232a, (2)\nwhere we have introduced the stripping operator\nO1(b, br , \u0001\u0302) = (1 \u2212 |Sn(bn)|2)|Sc(bc, \u0001\u0302)|2 (3)\nand where the bra-ket notation on the right-hand side of\nEq. (2) implies integration over all r , all orientations \u0001\u0302, and\nspin variables. Denoting by \u3008. . .\u3009spin the integration over only\nthe spin variables, we can rewrite this cross section as follows:\n\u03c3strip = 12J + 1\n\u222b\ndb\n\u222b\nd r\n\u222b\nd\u0001\u0302O1(b, br , \u0001\u0302)\n\u00d7\n\u2211\nmJ\n\u2329\u2223\u2223\u0006JmJ (r, \u0001\u0302)\u2223\u22232\u232aspin, (4)\nwhere we have also assumed that the S matrices, and hence\nO1, have no spin dependence.\nSimilarly, the integrated cross section for diffractive or\nelastic breakup,\u03c3diff , in this deformed core plus neutron system\nis given by the following:\n\u03c3diff = 12J + 1\n\u222b\ndb\n\u222b\ndk\n\u2211\nmJ \u03bd\n\u2223\u2223\u3008\u0006\u03bd(k)|\n[1 \u2212 Sn(bn)Sc](bc, \u0001\u0302)\n\u2223\u2223\u0006JmJ (r, \u0001\u0302)\u232a\u2223\u22232, (5)\nwhere the \u0006\u03bd(k) are the core-plus-neutron unbound states with\nappropriate neutron and core asymptotic quantum numbers \u03bd\nand wave number k.

Deformed-core projectile wave functions\nMost generally, the projectile ground-state wave function\n\u0006JmJ (r, \u0001\u0302) is taken to be a coupled channels eigenstate of\na quadrupole-deformed core plus neutron system with total\nangular momentum J (as in, e.g., Ref [8]). The neutron-core\ninteraction is Vnc(r, \u0001\u0302). The orbital angular momentum \t of\nthe neutron (Fig. 1) is not a good quantum number and is\ncoupled to the intrinsic spin s of the neutron to give j and with\nthe core spin I to give J, with an assumed coupling order of\n[[\t \u2297 s] j \u2297 I ] JmJ . The neutron spin s = 1\/2 is understood\nthroughout. The neutron spin states are denoted by the spinors\nXsms and the normalized core states by \u0005ImI (\u0001\u0302). The \u0005ImI (\u0001\u0302)\nare assumed to be the states of the K = 0 rotational band of\na rigid rotor, thus \u0005ImI (\u0001\u0302) \u2261 YImI (\u0001\u0302) and the values of I are\nrestricted to even values.\nWe thus construct a set of total angular momentum\neigenstates\nY\nJmJ (r\u02c6, \u0001\u0302) =\n\u2211\nm\tmsmjmI\n(\tm\tsms |jmj )\n\u00d7 (jmjImI |JmJ )\u0005ImI (\u0001\u0302)Y\tm\t(r\u02c6)Xsms ,\n(11)\nwhere\n \u2261 (\t, j, I ), in which to expand the projectile\u2019s ground\nstate as follows:\n\u0006JmJ (r, \u0001\u0302) =\n\u2211\n\n\nR\nJ (r)Y\nJmJ (r\u02c6, \u0001\u0302), (12)\nin states with parity (\u22121)\t and with radial wave functions\nR\nJ (r).

The\ndeformed Woods-Saxon potential is as follows:\nVws(r, \u0001\u0302) = \u2212Vws\/{1 + exp[(r \u2212 R(r\u02c6 \u00b7 \u0001\u0302))\/aws]} (15)\nand has strengthVws, diffuseness aws, and deformed core radius\nparameter\nR(r\u02c6 \u00b7 \u0001\u0302) = Rws[1 + \u03b22Y20(r\u02c6 \u00b7 \u0001\u0302)] (16)\nwith quadrupole deformation \u03b22.

CORE- AND NEUTRON-TARGET S MATRICES\nThe deformed core and neutron-target S matrices are\ncalculated within the optical limit of Glauber\u2019s multiple\nscattering theory [9]. These involve a double and single\nfolding, respectively, of the particle and target one-body\ndensities with an effective nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction.\nWe assume here, for simplicity, a zero-range delta interaction.\nIn the case of a quadrupole deformed core of density \u03c1c(r, \u0001\u0302)\ninteracting with a spherical target of density \u03c1t (r) then\nSc(bc, \u0001\u0302) = exp[\u2212\u03c3\u00afNN (1 \u2212 i\u03b1\u00afNN )\u03c7c(bc, \u0001\u0302)\/2], (29)\nwhere (e.g., Ref.

[10], which\nare used in the present analysis. We include multipole terms\nwith L = 0, 2, and 4 in Eq. (33).\nBecause the unit vectors \u02c6Rc and \u0001\u0302 are as follows:\n\u02c6Rc = [bc cos \u03c6c \u0131\u02c6 + bc sin \u03c6c \u02c6j + zc \u02c6k ]\/Rc (35)\nand\n\u0001\u0302 = sin \u03b1 cos \u03b2 \u0131\u02c6 + sin \u03b1 sin \u03b2 \u02c6j + cos \u03b1 \u02c6k, (36)\nthe argument of the Legendre polynomials in Eq.

(41)\nIV. APPLICATIONS TO SINGLE-NEUTRON KNOCKOUT\nWe now apply the formalism, developed in detail in Secs. II\nand III, to model two specific knockout reaction systems. Both\nchosen reactions were the subject of recent experiments carried\nout at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at\nMichigan State University. These are the 9Be(11Be,10Be)X\nreaction at a beam energy of 60 MeV per nucleon [6] and\nthe 9Be(17C,16C)X reaction at 62 MeV per nucleon [14].\nThe projectile ground-states are 1\/2+ and 3\/2+, respectively.\nThese examples have been chosen as there is evidence of\nsignificant neutron plus excited core components in the 11Be\nand 17C ground-states and their low-energy structures. There\nwere also discrepancies noted between the spherical spectator\ncore calculations and the data in both instances [6,14].\nA. Application to 11Be\nThe J = 1\/2,11Be projectile ground state has positive\nparity and, when including I\u03c0 = 0+ and 2+ core states, has\nground-state configurations [n\tj \u2297 I\u03c0 ]J with orbital angular\nmomenta \t = 0 and 2. Our wave function, Eq. (12), is a\nsuperposition of [2s1\/2 \u2297 0+], [1d3\/2 \u2297 2+], and [1d5\/2 \u2297 2+]\nneutron configurations [8] with spectroscopic factors of 0.85,\n0.02, and 0.13, respectively. The radial wave functions were\ncalculated by numerically solving the coupled channels set,\nEq. (13). We use a deformation parameter \u03b22 = +0.67\ncomputed [8] from the B(E2) value of Ref. [15] and the 10Be\n2+ state energy is \u000b2 = 3.4 MeV. The neutron-core potential\nparameters used were Vws = 54.24 MeV, Vso = 8.50 MeV,\naws = aso = 0.65 fm, and Rws = Rso = 2.483 fm. With these\nparameters the coupled channels ground state reproduces the\n11Be neutron separation energy of 0.5 MeV. Because J = 1\/2,\nthere are contributions to the cross sections only from k = 0\nand hence I = L = 0, 2, 4 in Eq. (25).\nFollowing Sec. III, the calculation of the core-target\nS matrix uses a Woods-Saxon 10Be matter density with rms\nradius of 2.28 fm [16], \u03b22 = +0.67 and a diffuseness of\n0.5 fm. For the 9Be target we used a spherical Gaussian density\n064608-5\nP. BATHAM, I. J. THOMPSON, AND J. A. TOSTEVIN PHYSICAL REVIEW C 71, 064608 (2005)\nwith rms matter radius of 2.36 fm [17]. The value of \u03c3\u00afNN ,\ncalculated from the free np and nn total cross sections using\nthe formulas of Ref. [18], was 88.0 mb. The \u03b1\u00afNN value was\nthen computed from the 100 MeV real to imaginary nn and\nnp amplitude ratios, 1.87 and 1.00 of Ref. [13]. The resulting\nvalue is \u03b1\u00afNN = 1.22. To assess the core deformation effects\non the reaction dynamics, calculations using this Sc(bc, \u0001\u0302) are\ncompared with the corresponding (spherical core) calculations\nusing the Sc(bc) computed assuming \u03b22 = 0 and with the same\ncore rms matter radius, 2.28 fm.\nWith \u03b22 = 0.67 the full calculations yield \u03c3strip = 108.9 mb\nand \u03c3diff = 86.5 mb. With the spherical Sc, \u03c3strip = 108.3 mb\nand \u03c3diff = 78.3 mb. So, upon including the deformed-core\nS matrix the inclusive diffractive cross section is increased by\n8.2 mb, which, given the large 0+ state spectroscopic factor of\n0.85, is expected to feed predominantly the 2+ core state. These\nfully dynamical calculations are therefore consistent with the\nearlier, magnitude estimate of 8 mb (for an assumed 0+ state\nspectroscopic factor of 0.74) made in Ref. [6]. The stripping\ncross section is seen to be essentially unchanged within our\nweak-coupling approach, consistent with the findings of the\nstrong-coupling stripping calculations of Ref. [7].\nOur ability to compare our model calculations with the\nexperimental data is hindered by their inclusive nature. To\nmake such a comparison, the present model calculations are\nmost realistically compared with the sum of the measured\npartial cross sections to the 0+ [203(31) mb] and 2+ [16(4) mb]\nstates in 10Be. There is also measured cross section to negative\nparity states in 10Be, at around 6 MeV, but this is the result\nof neutron removal from the 10Be core and such effects are\nabsent from our present two-body model. Our full dynamical\ncalculation yields an inclusive 0+ and 2+ state single neutron\nremoval cross section of 195 mb. This compares well with the\nmeasured value of 219(31) mb [6].\nB. Application to 17C\nAnother very interesting reaction system is the removal of a\nsingle (weakly bound) neutron from 17C. The ground-state-to-\nground-state neutron separation energy is 0.729 MeV. How-\never, the shell model predicts only a very small component of\nthe 16C(0+) ground state configuration in the 17C(3\/2+) ground\nstate, with a spectroscopic factor of only 0.03 [14]. Thus,\nwithin a conventional spherical spectator-core calculation,\nthis theoretical \t = 2 ground-state-to-ground-state neutron\nknockout partial cross section is only 2 mb. Experimentally,\nhowever, this partial cross section is measured to be 22(11)\nmb [14]. The shell model suggests that the major 17C ground-\nstate spectroscopic strength (of 1.44) is associated with an\n\t = 2 neutron coupled to the 16C(2+) core excited state with\nE\u2217 = 1.77 MeV and thus with neutron separation energy of\n2.5 MeV.\nHere we model the 17C(J = 3\/2+) ground state by use of\nour quadrupole-deformed-core plus neutron model. As there\nis vanishing shell model strength to the 16C(0+) core state, the\nprojectile wave function is described as a pure [1d5\/2 \u2297 2+]J\nconfiguration, where the single particle radial wave function\nR(\tsjI )J (r) is calculated in a central Woods-Saxon potential\n(Vso = 0, \u03b22 = 0) with radius parameter Rws = 1.25A1\/3c fm\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\nS\u2013matrix  deformation \u03b22\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nCr\nos\ns \nse\nct\nio\nns\n  (m\nb)\nStripping\nDiffractive \nSum\nFIG. 2. Dependence of the calculated stripping and diffractive\nsingle-neutron removal cross sections, and their sum, upon the\nassumed core deformation \u03b22 for the 9Be(17C,16C)X reaction at\n62 MeV per nucleon. The calculations are for a spectroscopic factor\nof 1.\nand diffuseness aws = 0.7 fm. For the calculations of the\ndeformed core-target S matrix we used a Woods-Saxon 16C\nmatter density with rms radius of 2.70 fm [17], a diffuseness\nof 0.5 fm, and deformation \u03b22. The choice of this deformation\nis discussed below. The Gaussian 9Be target density was the\nsame as used in the 11Be projectile case, above. The value\nof \u03c3\u00afNN was now 84.7 mb and, from the 100 MeV real to\nimaginary nn and np amplitude ratios, 1.87 and 1.00 of [13],\n\u03b1\u00afNN = 1.23.\nIn this 17C case, because of our assumed fully 2+ core\nground state, the core deformation \u03b22 enters only into the\ndeformed core-target S matrix. The choice of a realistic 16C\ncore deformation is less clear. We note, for example, the\nrecent measurement by Imai et al. [19] of an anomalously\nsmall B(E2 : 2+1 \u2192 0+) strength in 16C, with implications for\ndetails of both the core structure and for its charge deformation.\nBecause, in the present application, core excitation is en-\ntirely macroscopic and strong interaction induced, because of\nSc(bc, \u0001\u0302), further detailed consideration of this core structure\nis quite beyond the scope of the present model, where it enters\nonly through a mass \u03b22. We thus comment below on the\ndependence of the calculated cross sections on a wide range\nof assumed \u03b22 values.\nFor such an orientation, we first assume a maximal mass\ndeformation, \u03b22 = 0.55, typical of values extracted from\nanalyses of data from (surface dominated) light-ion and\nheavy-ion induced inelastic scattering of 12C [20,21]. For\n\u03b22 = 0.55 the calculated single particle cross sections (for\nunit spectroscopic factor) are \u03c3strip = 29.7 mb and \u03c3diff =\n29.7 mb. When using the spherical Sc, \u03c3strip = 28.3 mb and\n\u03c3diff = 11.8 mb. So, when including this maximally deformed-\ncore S matrix the inclusive diffractive cross section is increased\nby 17.9 mb. Given that, in our model, we have incident flux\nonly in the 2+ core state channel, this enhanced diffractive\ncross section may be expected to feed, predominantly, the 16C\n0+ state. Once again, the stripping cross section is found to be\nessentially unchanged by the core dynamics, consistent with\nRef. [7]. The dependence of our fully dynamical model \u03c3diff\nand \u03c3strip on the assumed \u03b22 value are shown in Fig. 2. The\n064608-6\nDYNAMICAL CORE DEFORMATION EFFECTS ON . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 71, 064608 (2005)\ncalculations presented are the single-particle cross sections\ncalculated with unit spectroscopic factor. Compared to the\nspherical core value \u03c3diff = 11.8 mb, the calculated values are\n14.5 mb and 22.1 mb, respectively, for \u03b22 = 0.20 and 0.40,\n\u03c3diff increasing monotonically with deformation.\nOur model calculations may be compared with the sum\nof the measured partial cross sections to the 0+ [22(11) mb]\nand 2+ [60(12) mb] states of 16C, namely 82(16) mb [14].\nThere is also measured strength to the 4+ state near 4 MeV\nof excitation, but this is not resolved from neighboring J = 2\nand J = 3 states and is not quantified here. When including\nthe [1d5\/2 \u2297 2+] state shell model spectroscopic factor of 1.44\nwe obtain a theoretical cross section of \u03c3th = 86 mb from the\nmaximally deformed case (with \u03b22 = 0.55) and 58 mb from\nthe spherical core calculation. We can conclude that, because\nof the enhanced diffractive cross sections for all |\u03b22| > 0,\nall of the deformed core calculations move the theoretical\nvalue in the direction of the measured value, 82(16) mb.\nMore information is needed to inform the correct value of the\nmass \u03b22 to be used in the present strong interaction, inelastic\nexcitations, context.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have investigated the effects of including the dynamical\nreorientation and inelastic excitation of an assumed quadrupole\ndeformed projectile core in the reaction mechanism of the\nsingle nucleon knockout reaction. Both the elastic breakup\nand stripping components of the inclusive knockout cross\nsections are treated nonperturbatively, within the eikonal\napproximation.\nIn the two model examples considered we find an enhance-\nment of the diffractive breakup component of the cross section\nindicating that the core is dynamically active in the transfer\nof energy from the center of mass motion to excitation of\nthe projectile. In contrast, the cross section for the essentially\ngeometrical, absorptive stripping mechanism is found to be\nunaffected. Although in the present inclusive calculation we\ncannot apportion the additional diffractive cross section to\nthe population of any specific final states, the magnitudes of the\ncore dynamical effects are of the same order as the partial cross\nsection that is observed to be missing in comparisons between\nspherical core calculations and selected, more exclusive, data\nsets.\nWe suggest therefore that the extension of the present\nwork, to allow partial cross section calculations, would be\nvery worthwhile and it is under consideration. Because we\nhave clarified here that the dominant dynamical effects are on\nthe elastic breakup cross section, then fully coupled channels,\ntime-dependent, and other all-order breakup methodologies\ncould also be used for this purpose.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the United Kingdom Engineer-\ning and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through\nGrant GR\/M82141.\n[1] P.
