The conference discussed how Islam has developed and is being practised in \nthese societies after the end of 70 years of official Communist atheism. A second aim \nwas to explore how an understanding of Islam in this region could benefit from \ncomparison with the anthropology of Islam in other Muslim societies. The Muslim \npopulations of the former Soviet Union share a common historical experience. Soviet \nstate policies towards Islam were relatively uniform throughout the territory of the \nUnion. Until the perestroika reforms in the latter half of the 1980s, the majority of \nMuslim citizens were isolated from contacts with the wider Muslim world. Access to \nformal religious education was restricted to a small circle of official imams who studied \nin the two religious training institutions serving the entire country. For others, \nopportunities for Islamic learning were limited to lessons from neighbourhood mullahs \nor female religious specialists, most of whom had little religious training themselves. \nThe number of mosques permitted to operate was relatively small and people were \ndiscouraged from attending them. As a result, the practice of Islam for most Muslims \nwas largely confined to the performance of life cycle rituals such as weddings, \ncircumcisions and funerals.  \nWith the break-up of the Soviet Union there was an upsurge in interest in Islam \non the part of the Muslim populations of all the successor states. In many of the Muslim \nmajority republics, such as those of Central Asia, central governments have adopted the \nIslamic heritage of their region as a key element of nation-building projects. What \nunites the experience of Muslims in these societies is the sudden re-emergence of Islam \ninto the public sphere, the opening up of contacts with the broader Muslim world, and \nIntroduction \n 2\ngreater opportunities for studying Islam both abroad and at home in newly opened \nmadrasas and religious higher education institutions. As students have returned home \nand as missionaries from Muslim countries have entered the region, people have \nbecome acquainted with ideas and movements within Islam which have long been \ncirculating in the wider Muslim world.  \n The institutional structure of religious administration, a legacy of the Soviet \nperiod, is another factor common across the Muslim republics. The Soviet Union\u2019s four \nregional Spiritual Boards were responsible for registering mosques, appointing imams, \nand monitoring religious practice. These have been \u2018nationalised\u2019, with each republic \nforming its own independent board and religious training institutions. While all are \nformally non-governmental institutions, as they were in the Soviet Union, the extent to \nwhich they remain under the control of state authorities depends on how tightly \nreligious practice is regulated in a particular republic. Thus, the Muslim Board of \nUzbekistan is much more closely tied to central government than its counterparts in, for \nexample, Dagestan or Tatarstan. \nUp to now, analysis of Islam in the former Soviet Union has been principally \ndominated by a concern about religious extremism. A large body of literature has been \nproduced by journalists, policy think tanks, and international conflict resolution \norganisations speculating upon the challenge Islam poses to secular governments and \nregional stability. Much of this analysis places Islamic extremism within a volatile mix \nof poverty, water scarcity, inter-ethnic tensions, and repressive local regimes which \nthreatens to explode at any moment1. Unfortunately academic studies have not been \nimmune to this view. Even if analysis by social scientists tends to be more measured, \nthe question of Islam is too often framed in terms of an Islamic \u2018resurgence\u2019, evidenced \nby such phenomena as the dramatic increase in the number of mosques, the formation of \nIslamic political parties, and the activities of missionaries from other Muslim countries2. \nMany have discussed whether \u2018extremist\u2019 or \u2018fundamentalist\u2019 movements have gained a \nfoothold in post-Soviet states and whether local populations are likely to be attracted to \nthese trends or to remain loyal to \u2018traditional\u2019, locally rooted forms of \u2018moderate\u2019 \nIslam3. These studies confine themselves to the macro-level of government policy and \nreligious movements. When the practice of ordinary Muslims is touched upon, it is \ngenerally glossed over as \u2018traditional\u2019 or \u2018parallel\u2019 Islam and left largely unexamined. \n The study of Islam in both the Soviet Union and in post-Soviet societies has \nsuffered from being placed within an overly limiting analytical framework. Before the \nIntroduction \n 3\ndemise of the Soviet Union this was Sovietology. Within this framework, Islam was \ninteresting to Western analysts primarily in terms of the potential threat it posed to \nCommunist rule in the Muslim republics4. Research on Islam in the post-Soviet era has \nlargely pursued similarly instrumentalist objectives, adapted to fit a changed political \nenvironment. This analysis is framed within what are ultimately the geopolitical and \nsecurity concerns of the US and Western European governments and therefore fails to \naddress the significance for local Muslims of debates and struggles surrounding the \npractice of Islam. It does not shed light on the varied ways in which Muslims in post-\nSoviet societies are exploring and questioning what it means to be a good Muslim. \n What has been largely missing up to now is a nuanced account of how Islam is \nlived \u2018on the ground\u2019. We need to look beyond categories such as \u2018fundamentalism\u2019 and \n\u2018tradition\u2019 to reveal the dynamic interactions between the actors in central governments, \nofficials within the quasi-state religious administrations, religious groups not sponsored \nby local governments, and the diversity of Muslim believers, all of whom are motivated \nby their individual agendas, interests and beliefs. Most importantly, we need to adopt an \nanalytical frame which can accommodate the study Islam in the region on its own terms \nand at the same time place Islam in post-Soviet space within a comparative perspective \nof Islam as practiced in the wider Muslim world.  \n \nThe study of Islam in the Soviet Union \nSome of the richest ethnographic accounts of the practice of Islam in the Soviet period \nand earlier are provided by Soviet ethnographers. However, the analytical slant of this \nliterature was shaped by the necessity of writing in accordance with Soviet state policy \nand Marxist-Leninist ideology. Islam, and religion in general, was assumed to be \nregressive in two ways. It acted to further the interests of exploitative classes by \nconcealing the real relations of production5. It was also identified with pre-modern \nsocieties which Soviet ideologues assumed would whither away naturally with the \nadvance of the socialist modernity. Given this ideological straitjacket, it was inevitable \nthat the everyday practice of Islam in the period of mature socialism would be viewed in \nterms of \u2018traditionalism\u2019. In addition, because of the existence of a quasi-state \nregulatory structure, many Soviet analysts have tended to identify an \u2018official\u2019, textually \n\u2018pure\u2019 Islam which existed within this structure where imams and religious officials \nwere formally educated in the central scriptures of Islam. They opposed to this a \n\u2018popular\u2019, \u2018traditional\u2019 practice which existed outside official regulation. \nIntroduction \n 4\n Sergei Poliakov\u2019s analysis of Islam in Central Asia is fairly typical in this \nregard. Although he went against the grain of Soviet scholarship in asserting that Islam \nwas not being displaced by a secular, socialist consciousness, he characterises rural \nCentral Asia in the late Soviet period as a \u2018traditional society\u2019. By this he means \u2018the \ncomplete rejection of anything new introduced from outside into the familiar, \n\u2018traditional\u2019 way of life\u20196. He distinguishes between the \u2018government Islam\u2019 of the few \nregistered mosques, and the vastly more widespread \u2018everyday\u2019 Islam. The latter is \ncomprised of worship at the large number of buildings which serve as unregistered \nmosques, the veneration of holy sites (mazars), and the various life cycle rituals held by \nfamilies with community involvement. The \u2018underground\u2019 imams who officiated at the \nunregistered mosques, the female religious specialists, and the guardians of mazars \nlacked formal religious learning. However, being closer to ordinary people than \nofficially appointed imams they exerted a strong influence. Poliakov argues that this \n\u2018everyday\u2019 Islam regulated daily life in families and neighbourhoods, and generated a \nparticular \u2018traditional\u2019 way of life. \n Arising from the association of \u2018real\u2019 Islam with the formal learning of official \nimams is a tendency in Soviet scholarship to identify non-scriptural practices as \u2018pre-\nIslamic\u2019 survivals. Practices described in this way include healing and divination \nundertaken through the medium of spirit beings (usually referred to as shamanism), \nbelief in the destructive influence of the evil eye and witchcraft, the production and use \nof protective amulets, and many of the customs and ceremonies connected with life \ncycle rituals7. Thus, what emerge from Soviet ethnographic accounts of Islam are clear \nsets of oppositions; that between the \u2018official\u2019 and the \u2018traditional\u2019, and between \u2018pure\u2019 \nIslam and \u2018pre-Islamic tradition\u2019. \n Studies by scholars outside the Soviet Union often adopted similar dualistic \noppositions. The concept of \u2018parallel\u2019 Islam was most notably developed by the \nSovietologist Alexandre Bennigsen to mean Muslim practices which took place outside \nthe sphere of the Muslim Boards and official mosques8. However, rather than \nidentifying these practices with traditionalism, the emphasis is placed on the fact that \nthey escaped state regulation and control. As such they potentially posed a threat to the \nauthority of the Soviet state. This approach has been followed by others who have \ndescribed how officially established imams attempted to reconcile the tenets of Islam \nwith communist ideology and at times acted as spokesmen for the Soviet regime in \nforeign policy matters. \u2018Parallel Islam\u2019, on the other hand, was seen as potentially \nIntroduction \n 5\nsubversive by Soviet authorities9. Yaacov Ro\u2019i\u2019s recently published study of Islam in \nthe Soviet Union, one of the most comprehensive such studies to date, similarly adopts \nthe categories of establishment and parallel Islam10. \n There have been a number of criticisms of such a sharply dichotomous view of \nthe practice of Islam in the Soviet Union. It has been argued that far from being \nclandestine and outside of state control, unregistered mullahs were in fact supervised by \nofficially appointed imams11. Ro\u2019i himself has described the links between the official \nspiritual directorates and unregistered religious practitioners12. Shirin Akiner has \nsuggested that Muslim practice be placed on a continuum of shades of belief from the \naffective (for example the wearing of protective amulets) and integrative (celebrations \nwhich foster communal solidarity) to a spiritual and intellectual relationship with God \nframed by a formal system of belief. She argues that the spiritual, intellectual end of the \ncontinuum was blocked off for most of the population during Soviet rule reducing Islam \nto a state of primitive superstition13. \n One of the most interesting criticisms has been made by Mark Saroyan. As well \nas demonstrating that popular practices penetrated into the official space of the mosque, \nand visa versa, he has argued that the Muslim leadership within the official religious \nhierarchy were not mere mouthpieces for the state authorities. He interprets their \nattempts to reconcile the principles of Islam with Communist Ideology not as \naccommodationism but as a counter discourse. By reworking state discourses of the \n\u2018new Soviet man\u2019 into the \u2018new Soviet Muslim citizen\u2019 they attempted to subvert the \nstate\u2019s hegemonic argument that religion only served to hamper human progress14. \nThus, \u2018official Islam\u2019 cannot be assumed to be merely state controlled Islam since the \nofficial institutions encompassed diverse agendas and interpretations of Islam which \nwere not always entirely in keeping with the Soviet state ideology.  \n Although these critiques of a stark separation between \u2018official\u2019 and \u2018parallel\u2019 \nIslam demonstrate how interconnected the two were in reality, they do not entirely \nescape the limitations of the more crude dualistic models. In common with Soviet \nscholarship they fail to take seriously the practice of the majority of Muslims. Lying \nbehind the analysis is an assumption of some version of the dichotomy between the \nGreat and Little traditions popularised in relation to Islam by Gellner15. They continue \nto relegate non-scriptural practice to the realms of unreflexive tradition. However, if we \ndismiss the local practice of Muslims as mere superstition in opposition to the rational \nbelief systems of textual religion, we ignore how they constitute equally coherent \nIntroduction \n 6\nreflections on the order of the world and the place of humans within it, on concepts of \nmorally good action, and on the nature of a person\u2019s relationship with God16. Moreover, \nthe category of \u2018pure\u2019 or \u2018orthodox\u2019 Islam of the Great tradition does not take account of \nthe diversity of interpretation within scripturalist Islam itself.  \n \nFrom \u2018official\u2019 to \u2018traditional\u2019 Islam, from \u2018parallel\u2019 to \u2018fundamentalist\u2019 Islam \nWith the break-up of the Soviet Union there has been renewed popular interest in Islam. \nSince the Muslim republics gained independence, greater freedoms of religious \nexpression have been instituted and contacts with the rest of the Muslim world \nexpanded. From a situation where Islam was suppressed or at best reluctantly tolerated \nby state authorities, in many of the successor states it has been actively embraced by \nruling elites as a source of legitimacy for their regimes and as an element in their state-\nbuilding projects. However, this does not mean that all interpretations of Islam and all \nforms of Muslim practice have been able to compete on equal terms. Religious \nexpression continues to be regulated more or less closely in the different republics \nthrough the quasi-state Muslim religious administrations. \nFor example, in Uzbekistan the Karimov regime promotes Islam as an element \nof Uzbek national culture. A national heritage version Islam, which celebrates the \nachievements of figures in Islamic history who can be shown to have some connection \nwith the present territory of the country, is constructed within state discourses17 and \npresented as in keeping with local \u2018tradition\u2019 (see the contributions of Kehl-Bodrogi and \nLouw). These include figures such as Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Bukhari, the 9th century \ncompiler of the most authoritative collections of hadith, and Baha\u2019 ad-Din Naqshband, \nfounder of the Naqshabandi Sufi order. The only form of Islam permitted is that of the \nHanafi school and a sanitised celebration of Uzbekistan\u2019s Sufi tradition. Any religious \npractice or the expression of ideas outside these narrow bounds is ruthlessly suppressed. \nIn the case of Tatarstan and Dagestan in the Russian Federation, the official \nMuslim boards have been appropriated by the leaders of Sufi tariqats (orders) which \noperated outside the official religious administrative structures during the Soviet period. \nThe main challenge to their authority comes from reformist movements who promote a \nstrictly scriptural interpretation of Islam. They oppose much of local practice as un-\nIslamic innovation, reject the existence of hidden or mystical knowledge and divine \ngrace accessible only to Sufi shaykhs, and advocate a personal, direct relationship \nIntroduction \n 7\nbetween each Muslim and God through an informed interpretation of the Qur\u2019an and \nSunna. \nAs the political and religious landscape has changed in the ex-Soviet republics, \nthe terms of analysis used by those studying Islam in the region have correspondingly \nshifted. However, striking continuities with the studies of Islam in the Soviet period \npersist. While the term \u2018parallel\u2019 Islam is no longer widely used, many writers continue \nto construct a dichotomy between \u2018official\u2019 and \u2018unofficial\u2019 Islam. The former retains its \nreference to the state, but is now identified with local \u2018tradition\u2019, reflecting the fact that \npractice which in the Soviet period was a marker of \u2018parallel\u2019 Islam is now being \npromoted by many post-Soviet governments. \u2018Unofficial\u2019 Islam as the term suggests \ncontinues to refer to practice which takes place outside the sphere of the quasi-state \nreligious hierarchies. However, these now tend to be identified as \u2018fundamentalist\u2019, \n\u2018Wahahhabi\u2019, \u2018Islamist\u2019 or \u2018revivalist\u2019. They are described as foreign or alien ideologies \nwhich were introduced to the region in the last years of the Soviet Union and especially \nsince its collapse18. \nThis sort of characterisation suffers from the same deficiency as the similarly \ndualistic analysis of Islam in the Soviet Union. In fact, many of those who describe \nIslamic practice in terms of official and unofficial Islam themselves admit that it is often \ndifficult to draw a clear distinction between them. Individuals might describe \nthemselves as both followers of \u2018traditional\u2019 forms of Islam and as reformists who \ndisapprove of many local non-scripturalist elements of local Muslim practice. Perhaps \nmore importantly, however, the use of terms such as \u2018traditional\u2019 \u2018fundamentalist\u2019 and \n\u2018alien\u2019 Islam hinders clear understanding because it adopts terms internal to local \ndiscourses as objective analytical and descriptive categories. \nThe term \u2018traditional\u2019 is not value-neutral. It is used as a weapon in the \nideological and theological debates of different groups in their struggles to define and \npromote their own versions of Islamic orthodoxy. The Karimov regime in Uzbekistan \npromotes its own interpretation of Islam based upon what it constructs as the region\u2019s \nIslamic past. It refers to the \u2018Golden Heritage\u2019 (altin meros) of the nation, its Sufi \ntradition and the Hanafi legal school. All other interpretations of Islam are defined as \n\u2018bad\u2019 Islam, foreign inspired, fundamentalist and extremist, alien to Uzbek tradition and \nspiritual values, and linked to national and international terrorist networks. On the other \nhand, for many groups who promote a scripturalist interpretation of Islam \u2018tradition\u2019 has \nnegative connotations. It refers to un-Islamic innovation which needs to be expunged \nIntroduction \n 8\nfrom local practice. People who hold such views might be members of Islamic \nmovements acting outside the sphere of the official religious regulative structures. At \nthe same time they could just as easily be officially appointed imams who frown upon \nthe visiting of shrines and the activities of those who heal illness or claim to foretell the \nfuture with the aid of spirit helpers. In this collection, Krisztina Kehl-Bodrogi provides \nan insightful analysis of the dilemmas faced by officially appointed imams in a major \nshrine in Uzbekistan. These imams find themselves caught between their convictions \nthat the worship of saints is a form of idolatry, and the necessity of conforming to state \npolicies which condones, and even encourages, the visitation of shrines as part of Uzbek \nnational tradition.  \nBy describing a certain category of religious practice as \u2018traditional\u2019, those who \naim to understand the dynamics of Islamic practice are in fact entering into local \ndebates about what constitutes \u2018correct\u2019 Islam. They are implying the existence of a \nfrozen, reified version of Islam which is re-emerging after 70 years of Soviet \nsuppression and failing to recognise the fact that the practice of Islam is, and always has \nbeen, produced within a dynamic process of contestation, change and development. By \ncharacterising certain ideas and groups as \u2018alien\u2019 and \u2018non-traditional\u2019 they implicitly \nsupport parties within this contest which use similar labels to delegitimise competing \nvisions of Islam. \n \nAn anthropological approach to Islam in post-Soviet societies \nThe emergence of Islam as an object of comparative study within anthropology was \nmarked by the publication of Islam Observed in 1968, Clifford Geertz\u2019s study of Islam \nin Morocco and Indonesia19. As Robert Launay has observed, prior to this \nanthropologists tended to treat Islam as a textually defined set of beliefs external to the \nsocieties they studied. Islam was something that was transformed within local practice \ninto the syncretic religious forms anthropologists were actually interested in, and the \nstudy of Islam itself was left to theologians and Islamicists20. This is reminiscent of the \napproach adopted by the Soviet ethnographers I discussed above. Geertz, however, like \nmany of those who followed him within the growing field of the anthropology of Islam, \nwas concerned with developing an analytical framework which could recognise both the \nscriptural, theological and historical unity of Islam, as recognised by Muslims \nthemselves, as well as the diverse manner in which Islam was realised in local practice. \nIntroduction \n 9\nThe most notable example of this approach within the Soviet and post-Soviet \ncontext is Bruce Privratsky\u2019s account of Muslim practice in Kazakhstan21. Privratsky \nagues that we should not create a dichotomy between textually pure Islam and practices \nwhich are labelled pre-Islamic or shamanistic, such as the cult of the ancestors and \nhealing with the aid of spirits. Kazakhs themselves make distinctions between different \nforms of religious observance, referring to theological, Qur\u2019anic Islam as a pure ideal \nwhich is aspired to (taza jol), while the practice of Islam in everyday life is referred to \nas \u2018Muslimness\u2019 (musilmanshiliq). These, however, should not be seen as contrasted \ndomains but refer to different aspects of religious life. The Islamic ideal is most closely \napproximated by a group within society known as qojas, who claim descent from the \nProphet Muhammad or specific saints, and by older people. Privratsky uses the concept \nof collective memory as the link between a global Islamic tradition and the heterodox \ncomplex of Kazakh religious attitudes, which includes the cult of saints and ancestors as \nwell as healing cults. Kazakhs feel their religion is legitimately Islamic because it was \nhanded down to present generations by their ancestors who followed the path of pure \nIslam, because of the presence within society of the qojas and others who live the pure \npath on behalf of the rest of society, and also the physical presence within the Kazakh \nlandscape of the tombs of saints and other religious structures. \n A problem with this type of analysis, however, is that it suggests the existence of \ncoherent, localised formations of Islam, so that there is a distinctively Moroccan, \nIndonesian or Kazak Islam. These accounts do not sufficiently acknowledge the \ndiversity of interpretation within a particular society as different groups compete in \nasserting their own vision of \u2018correct\u2019 Islam. Moreover, while they acknowledge the \nexistence of a wider Muslim world, they do not take sufficient account of the linkages \nbetween local Muslims and ideas and trends circulating outside the local context. \nPerhaps most seriously, in directing their analysis towards showing that local practice is \nlegitimately Islamic, for example that it is the local contextualisation of a global \ntradition22 or the realisation of that tradition within a particular worldview23, they are in \neffect making a theological statement about what should be regarded as Islam24. They \nare in danger of being drawn into local debates and struggles over meaning and \nknowledge in the same way as are analysts of post-Soviet societies who define Islam in \nterms of \u2018extremism\u2019 or \u2018tradition\u2019. \n A more productive approach is suggested by Talal Asad. Islam, he argues, \nshould be studied as a discursive tradition that seeks to define the correct form and \nIntroduction \n 10\nmeaning of religious practice. It relates conceptions of an Islamic past with an Islamic \nfuture through practices, institutions and social relations in the present. Orthodoxy is \ncrucial to all Islamic traditions, but orthodoxy is not merely a body of opinion about the \ncorrect interpretation of Islamic texts. Rather, it is a relationship of power. \u2018Wherever \nMuslims have the power to regulate, uphold, require, or adjust correct practices, and to \ncondemn, exclude, undermine, or replace incorrect ones, there is the domain of \northodoxy\u201925. Rather than entering into debates about what can and cannot be \nconsidered as \u2018real\u2019 Islam, anthropologists should instead comment upon the processes \nand struggles through which local actors themselves attempt to define what constitutes \ntrue Islam and a good Muslim. \n This has broadly been the approach followed by most anthropologists writing \nabout Muslim societies in recent years. They have, for example, studied the discourses \nand struggles over what constitutes proper Muslim belief and practice26, the different \nand competing modes of authority and knowledge27, or they have looked at the linkages \nbetween local Muslim practice and global ideas and movements28. This is also the \napproach that contributors to this collection have taken with regard to Islam in post-\nSoviet space. Sergei Abashin provides a finely grained account of the competition for \nreligious authority and influence in a village in Tajikistan in the mid 1990s. He \nidentifies different actors in this competition, including those who claim descent from \nthe family of the Prophet Muhammad or from Muslim \u2018saints\u201929, a group called \nmahsums who are members of families locally recognised as having a continuous \ntradition of religious learning, and hajjis, a group of villagers who have made the \npilgrimage to Mecca and have obtained a degree of religious learning and knowledge of \nhow Islam is practised in the Middle East. Abashin describes the different means by \nwhich these actors have sought to legitimate their religious knowledge and authority. \nThese included claims to an ascribed, hereditary status, acquired learning, and \nsponsorship of the construction of mosques and other religiously oriented charity. Most \ninterestingly, he describes how local competition was intimately linked to national \nstruggles taking place at the time between the Communist and Islamic political parties, \nand how Muslim reformist missionaries from neighbouring Uzbekistan were \nincorporated within the religious competition of the village. \n  Vladimir Bobrovnikov also describes the religious politics of a village, in this \ninstance a village in a mountainous region of Daghestan. Although the parties in this \nconflict have been described as \u2018Sufis\u2019 and \u2018Wahhabis\u2019, he criticises the characterisation \nIntroduction \n 11\nof the conflict as one between \u2018traditional\u2019 and \u2018foreign\u2019 or \u2018extremist\u2019 Islam. He traces \nthe historical roots of the formation of local Muslim communities not to some pre-\nSoviet custom but to the process of Soviet collectivisation itself and the local \nadministrative structures instituted by the Soviet state. He describes how channels for \nthe transmission of religious knowledge have been transformed since the end of \nCommunist rule. The memorisation of 19th century lithographs of Arabic texts, which \nhad been the dominant form of Islamic learning during much of the Soviet period, has \nbeen displaced as villagers have been able to perform the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, \nMuslim missionaries have arrived from Turkey and the Arab Middle East, a network of \nsecondary and higher institutions of Islamic learning has been developed, and Islamic \nliterature in Russian and local languages has become freely available. Bobrovnikov \ngives an account how Islamic reformists have called for the \u2018purification\u2019 of Islam from \nwhat they consider to be non-Qur\u2019anic local customs. They and their opponents both \nclaim to represent \u2018true\u2019 Islam which they accuse others of having abandoned. The \nreformists in this debate have been labelled as \u2018Wahhabists\u2019, after the 18th century \nreformist movement in the Arabian Peninsula, while their opponents have been labelled \nas \u2018Sufists\u2019. Bobrovnikov argues, however, that these are pejorative labels employed as \ntools in the ongoing theological debate rather than accurate descriptions of the actual \npractices or affiliations of the parties involved. \n Most of the contributors to this collection have concentrated upon how struggles \nto define \u2018real\u2019 Islam take place among men. Habiba Fathi, however, provides an \ninteresting and much needed perspective by showing how this struggle also takes place \nwithin the religious practice of women. Her contribution focuses upon female religious \nspecialists in Uzbekistan called otin-oyi, who officiate at women\u2019s religious rituals and \nprovide Islamic education for girls and sometimes boys in their neighbourhoods. She \ndescribes the historical development of this particular role in Central Asia, and relates it \nto women religious specialists in other Muslim societies. Since the end of Soviet rule, a \nnew group of women, who have graduated from religious educational institutions, have \nbegun to emerge and are competing with \u2018traditional\u2019 otin-oyi in defining \u2018correct\u2019 \nIslamic practice. While not all otin-oyi agree with the theological message of these \n\u2018new\u2019 practitioners, they are nevertheless respected for their skill in the chanted \nrecitation of the Qur\u2019an. Fathi also gives an account of the involvement of women \nwithin the quasi-state religious institutions, and how theological struggles are fought in \nthat context as well. \nIntroduction \n 12\nKristina Kehl-Bodrogi\u2019s contribution focuses on a contest over the control of a \nregionally important shrine in Khorezm, Uzbekistan, a tomb attributed to the Sufi \nmystic Yusuf Hamadani. On one side of this contest are imams appointed to manage the \nshrine by the national religious administration, who are educated at state registered \ninstitutions of higher Islamic learning. Opposing them is a group of shaykhs who have \nbeen ousted from the shrine by the officially appointed imams. These shaykhs base their \nclaim to the shrine upon membership of lineages which have historically acted as its \ncustodians, receiving the offerings of pilgrims and reciting prayers for them. Both these \ngroups act out their competing claims and strategies within the broader context of the \ngovernment\u2019s attempts to construct its own particular vision of national and religious \nidentity, within which shrines such as this play an important part. While the officially \nappointed imams might prefer to take firmer action to discourage the veneration of \nsaints by pilgrims, a practice they regard as idolatrous, their freedom for action is \ncircumscribed by the fact that government ministers and the president himself have \nundertaken pilgrimage to major shrines. Overly active discouragement by the imams \nrisks placing them in opposition to the regime\u2019s own discourses. \nKehl-Bodrogi highlights the effect that the policies and active interventions of \ncentral government have had on local struggles and debates, something which is evident \nin most of the contributions in this collection. Indeed, the relationship between the state \nand Islam has been an important topic for anthropologists working in Muslim societies. \nAnthropologists have studied such issues as the place of Islam within civil society and \ndemocratic processes30, the attempts of state authorities to dominate the transmission of \nreligious knowledge31, or the effects of state power on the gendered practice of Islam32. \nAnthropologists working in post-Soviet Muslim societies are in a privileged position to \nprovide insights into this relationship. While in many Muslim majority countries central \ngovernments have sought to regulate religious expression and have incorporated \nreligious institutions and personnel within some form of state-controlled hierarchy, the \nSoviet Union arguably went further down this road than most. The policies and \ndiscourses of many post-Soviet governments, and the way these are operationalised by \nstate officials and others, continues to have a major impact in defining the possibilities \nand limits of religious expression. \nThe first anthropological analysis of this dynamic within the Soviet Union was \nGillian Tett\u2019s study of a village in Tajikistan during the perestroika period. She draws \non Nancy and Richard Tapper\u2019s analysis of the Turkish context33 to suggest a gendered \nIntroduction \n 13\ndivision of religious practice. Local practice was shaped by life within an authoritarian \nstate which curtailed pubic religious expression. Men were more likely to be engaged in \nthe public sphere and state employment and tended to be associated with the \nCommunist and modern side of village life. Women on the other hand were associated \nwith domestic space and perceived as central to its traditional values. Their performance \nof religious duties and adherence to local ideals of proper female behaviour helped to \nmaintain the community\u2019s sense of Tajik and Muslim identity34. \nThe effect of state power on Muslim religious expression is the central concern \nof Edmund Waite\u2019s contribution in this collection in which he deals with Islam among \nChina\u2019s Uyghur minority. Although China cannot of course be described as \u2018post-\nSoviet\u2019, the experience of Uyghur Muslims living under the Chinese version of state \nsocialism parallels in significant ways the experience of Muslims in Soviet and post-\nSoviet Central Asia. As in the Soviet Union, religious expression in China has been \nsubjected to periods of active suppression and relative tolerance. Moreover, again \nparalleling the situation in many post-Soviet societies, religious freedoms for the \nUyghurs were once more restricted from the late 1990s in response to fears of separatist \nand Islamic political movements. Waite analyses how changing state policy has \ninfluenced the way in which Uyghurs have been able to express themselves as Muslims. \nHe argues that the effect of state interventions has been to privilege the memorisation of \nkey religious texts in Arabic as the primary means of gaining Islamic knowledge, and to \nreinforce the position of the elders who mediate this transmission. Despite increasing \ntrans-national ties with neighbouring states and the increased availability of religious \nliterature printed in the regional capital of Xinjiang, state control of the main mosques \nand the imams who manage them effectively prevents those with a reformist agenda \nfrom openly preaching their beliefs \nThe remaining contributions deal with what might be called processes of self \nformation through which individuals explore and negotiate what it means to be a good \nMuslim. Maria Louw describes how Muslims in Uzbekistan re-establish a sense of \n\u2018normality\u2019 and moral direction in a situation where previous certainties and securities \nhave been shattered, and in which they feel helpless and dislocated. Through visiting the \nshrines of Muslim saints, and through dream encounters with these saints, they establish \na connection with divine knowledge and power which endows them with the agency to \nintervene successfully within a changed world. Saints and their shrines provide a moral \nfoundation upon which they can imagine an alternative sphere of being, which restores \nIntroduction \n 14\ntheir sense of themselves as good Muslims. She uses the phrase \u2018morality in the \nmaking\u2019 to convey the sense of how \u2018Muslimness\u2019, a local way of being Mulsim, is an \nongoing process of exploration and negotiation rather than a distinct and reified Uzbek \nversion of Islam, even though the post-independence government is attempting to fix it \nin this way. \nNegotiations and debates about what constitutes \u2018real\u2019 Islam are not confined to \ndistinctively religious sites such as mosques, madrasas, and the shrines of Muslim \nsaints. Nor is it only those recognised as religious specialists of one sort or another who \nengage in it. Julie McBrien\u2019s contribution shows that the Muslim public sphere where \nsuch debates take place can also encompass communal celebrations such as wedding \nfeasts, and how discussions which take place in this public sphere feed into the process \nby which individuals construct themselves as good Muslims. She describes the impact \nof a new, religiously oriented form of wedding celebration which is being adopted by \nsome households in a town in southern Kyrgyzstan. These new celebrations are \ndistinctive in that an attempt is made to conform to what are perceived to be Islamic \nprinciples. Thus, alcohol is not served, the guests are segregated by sex, and there is \nnone of the music or dancing which typically forms a central part of the evening phase \nof local wedding celebrations. A significant innovation is a religious sermon, usually \ngiven by well known preachers from outside the community. McBrien describes how \ninhabitants of the town explore alternative ways of living a Muslim life through \nattendance at these new wedding feasts, and how they provide a focus for discussion \nwithin the town about what it means to be a \u2018real\u2019 Muslim.  \n Since the restrictions upon religious practice have been relaxed a number of \nnew religious movements have appeared in the post-Soviet states. These draw upon \ndiverse religious and philosophical sources, but in the Muslim republics many have \ntaken on a distinctly Muslim cast. Pawel Jessa describes one such movement in \nKazakhstan called Aq jol (Pure Way). This movement is founded upon local traditions \nof healing and the visitation of the shrines of Muslim saints, and advocates that \nindividuals express their faith in God through developing and maintaining a state of \nspiritual purity. The central ritual of this movement consists of a healing ceremony held \non Thursday evenings during which the blessings of the ancestors are called down upon \nparticipants. The movement is expanding as members acquire their personal protective \nspirits, become healers and found their own affiliated groups. Such movements have not \ngenerally been studied by anthropologists of Muslim societies. This may be because \nIntroduction \n 15\nthey are not recognised by analysts as being truly Islamic, or perhaps because they are \nnot commonly found in the societies they study. However, much of the doctrine and \nritual of Aq jol derives from Islam as it is practised in Kazakhstan and most of its \nmembers describe themselves as Muslims. In studying Islam in post-Soviet societies Aq \njol and new religious movements like it cannot be ignored as they are part of the wider, \nongoing debate about what it means to be a Muslim. \n \nConclusion \nThis collection advances our understanding of Islam in post-Soviet societies by moving \nthe analysis beyond the simplistic opposition between \u2018traditionalism\u2019 and \u2018extremism\u2019 \nwhich has long dominated academic commentary. The contributions draw attention to \nthe local dynamics of debates about what it means to be a Muslim and explore the \nstakes involved in these struggles. Anthropological studies of Islam in other parts of the \nworld have been addressing these issues for some time. They have explored conflicts \nbetween followers of scripturalist interpretation who seek to \u2018purify\u2019 Islam from non-\nQur\u2019anic custom, and those for whom locally rooted practices are integral to their \nMuslim faith and an essential part of their relation to the divine. They have examined \nthe influence of global trends and translational movements on local practice. Most \nimportantly, they have sought to study the lived practice of Islam on its own terms, \nwithout prejudging what might constitute \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018genuine\u2019 Islam. The present \ncollection has extended these insights to the study of post-Soviet Muslims. \nA contribution which the study of this region can provide within the broader \nanthropology of Islam is to highlight the importance of exploring not just these \nprocesses and conflicts themselves, but also the conditions of possibility within which \nMuslims are able to express their faith and engage in debates about what it means to be \na Muslim. The state, because of its active interventions in the religious sphere in many \npost-Soviet societies, has an important influence on this. The contributions of Waite and \nKehl-Bodrogi illustrate particularly clearly how government policies and discourses \ndirectly shape the way in which their citizens are able to express themselves as \nMuslims. However, it is not simply a case of state authorities directing power \ndownward upon a less powerful population. Rather, debates of what it means to be a \nMuslim, and struggles to define \u2018orthodoxy\u2019, occur within relations of power in which \nparticipants draw upon multiple persuasive and coercive strategies and resources in \nputting forward their particular views. The coercive capacities of the state are among \nIntroduction \n 16\nthese resources and can be utilised within the personal projects of actors, both state \nofficials and others.  \nAbashin\u2019s analysis of religious conflict in Tajikistan is illustrative of this. He \nshows how competition within a particular village between different religious \nspecialists is based upon differing claims to knowledge and authority, on kinship \nrelations and control of economic capital. At the same time these local conflicts are not \nisolated from national events. The changing fortunes of national Islamic and \nCommunist political parties influence local conflicts, sometimes privileging certain \ngroups and then others. This is not because central government directly intervenes in \nlocal processes, but because the shifting national environment alters the possibilities for \naction at the local level.  \nIn a separate publication35 I have argued that the narrow interpretation by the \nregime in Uzbekistan of what is acceptable Islam, its willingness to ruthlessly suppress \nany form of expression it deems \u2018extremist\u2019, and the often arbitrary implementation of \nthis policy by law enforcement agencies, has created an atmosphere of vulnerability \nsurrounding religious practice. The label \u2018Wahhabi\u2019 has come to represent any religious \nexpression of which people are unsure, which does not fit into the category of the \nclearly \u2018acceptable\u2019, and which might make those associated with it a target for the state \nsecurity services. Parties in local rivalries are able to use the \u2018Wahhabi\u2019 label to \ndiscredit their opponents (whatever their actual beliefs or practice might be), to portray \nthem as being a threat to the regime. Thus, the regime\u2019s intolerant and repressive mode \nof engagement is generalised throughout society. \nWe need to study the lives of post-Soviet Muslims on their own terms. We need \nto explore the way in which people in this region are constructing themselves as good \nMuslims, the different sources of knowledge and authority they are calling upon in \ndoing this, and the relations of power within which this is taking place. Rather than \ntaking a position as to what constitutes \u2018real\u2019 Islam ourselves, we need to explore the \nconditions under which Muslims themselves are able to ask this question, and the \ndifferent answers they are proposing. \nIntroduction \n 17\nNotes: \n \n1\n See, for example, S.
