Introduction \nA burgeoning literature has documented that, in an increasingly globalized world, exporters \nand foreign owned firms are larger, more productive, more capital-intensive, and pay higher \nwages than their purely domestic counterparts1. Yet, the effects of being an exporter or \nforeign owned on other firm characteristics have received much less attention. This paper \nseeks to fill this gap in the literature, by using a large panel of UK firms to study whether \nthe two dimensions of firms\u2019 global participation, namely export behavior and foreign \nownership, affect firms\u2019 financial health.  \nOnly a handful of papers in the literature have looked at the effects of global \nengagement on firms\u2019 financial health, obtaining contrasting results. Along the first \ndimension of global participation, Campa and Shaver (2002) find that liquidity constraints \nare less binding for Spanish exporters compared to non-exporters; while Casta\u00f1eda (2002) \nshows that export-oriented Mexican firms faced higher financial constraints before the \n1995-2000 financial paralysis than after. Along the second dimension, and focusing \nrespectively on Colombia, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, and Estonia, Arbel\u00e1ez and Echavarr\u00eda (2002), \nHarrison and McMillan (2003), and Mickiewicz et al. (2004) show that foreign owned \nfirms face lower financial constraints compared to other firms. De Brun et al. (2002) find \nno such evidence for firms in Uruguay2. \nAll the above mentioned papers analyze financial constraints in the context of fixed \ninvestment regressions augmented with financial variables such as cash flow. In particular, \nthey consider the sensitivity of investment to cash flow as an indicator of the degree of \nfinancial constraints faced by firms: financially constrained firms (for whom access to \nexternal finance is difficult and\/or expensive) can only invest if they have sufficient internal \nfunds.  \n                                                 \n1 See Greenaway and Kneller (2007) for a survey on firm level adjustment to globalization. \n2 Related studies are Desai et al. (2008), who find that internal capital markets of multinational firms allow \ntheir affiliates to expand output after severe depreciations, when economies are fragile and prone to economic \ncontractions; Blalock et al. (2008), who show that following the 1997 East Asian financial crisis which led to \na dramatic currency devaluation, it was only those Indonesian exporters with foreign ownership who were \nable to increase investment significantly, while domestic firms were unable to do so due to financing \nconstraints; and Harrison et al. (2004), who find that direct foreign investment is associated with a reduction \nof financing constraints for firms without foreign assets and for domestically owned enterprises.  \n3 \nOur contribution to the literature is twofold. First, we study the effects of global \nengagement on firms\u2019 financial health in the UK. This is important because most of the \nstudies that looked at similar issues generally considered developing or transition countries. \nOur choice of the UK is motivated by the fact that this country ranks high in terms of global \nengagement: it is the fifth largest exporter of manufactures in the world and the second \nlargest host of multinational enterprises. Moreover, a rich firm-level dataset is available for \nthe UK, that covers mostly unlisted firms, which are generally small, young, and \nparticularly likely to face financial constraints.  \nWe expect globally engaged firms to face a lower degree of financial constraints \ncompared to their purely domestic counterparts for the following reasons. First, globally \nengaged firms have access to both internal and international financial markets, which \nenables them to diversify their sources of financing and the associated risks. Specifically, \nforeign owned firms can obtain credit from their parent company, insuring themselves \nagainst liquidity constraints (Desai et al., 2004)3. Second, as they benefit from a lower \nbankruptcy risk and adopt international standards faster in terms of product quality, foreign \nowned firms find it easier to gain access to domestic banks (Colombo, 2001; Harrison and \nMcMillan, 2003). Third, because they are also dependent on demand from foreign \ncountries, exporters are less tied to the domestic cycle, and less subject to those financial \nconstraints caused by tight monetary policy and recessions at home4. This leads to a more \nstable cash flow for exporters compared to non-exporters, which in turn leads to weaker \nliquidity constraints (Campa and Shaver, 2002; Garcia-Vega and Guariglia, 2008)5. Finally, \nbeing an exporter also provides a signal that the firm is sufficiently productive to generate \nenough profits in foreign markets to recover the sunk costs that need to be met when \nentering foreign markets for the first time (Roberts and Tybout, 1997). This increases the \nlikelihood that the firm will be able to service its external debt, and further relaxes the \nliquidity constraints that it faces. \n                                                 \n3 In a purely domestic framework, Hoshi et al. (1991) and Ng and Schaller (1996) consider firms belonging to \ngroups as less likely to face financing constraints.  \n4 This argument relies on the assumption that business cycles are not perfectly coordinated across countries. \n5 A more stable cash flow provides in fact greater assurances to lenders that the firm will be able to service its \nobligations.  \n4 \nOur second contribution to the literature is that we explore, for the first time, the \nlinks between firms\u2019 global engagement and their financial health in the context of \ninventory investment regressions. We estimate error-correction inventory investment \nequations augmented with a financial composition variable. As in the investment literature, \nwe interpret the coefficient on the latter as measures of the degree of financial constraints \nfaced by firms. We explore how these coefficients differ across firms classified into \nfinancially constrained and unconstrained in a traditional sense (based in turn on size, age, \nand risk), on the one hand; and across globally engaged and purely domestic, on the other. \nWe also compare the coefficients across globally engaged financially constrained firms and \npurely domestic financially constrained firms, with the objective of determining whether \nglobal engagement can shield firms from financial constraints. \nThree reasons justify our choice of inventory investment in our analysis. First, \nbecause of its high liquidity and low adjustment costs, inventory investment is likely to be \nmore sensitive to financial variables than investment in fixed capital (Carpenter et al., \n1994). Second, inventory investment plays a crucial role in business cycle fluctuations \n(Blinder and Maccini, 1991). Third, inventory investment equations are less likely than \nfixed investment equations to suffer from misspecification due to the inappropriate control \nfor investment opportunities6. \nOur results show that smaller, younger, and more risky firms, on the one hand; and \nfirms that are not globally engaged, on the other, exhibit higher sensitivities of inventory \ninvestment to our financial composition variable. Moreover, when we differentiate among \npurely domestic financially constrained firms, globally engaged financially constrained \nfirms, and financially unconstrained firms, we find that the effects of our financial variable \nare statistically significant only for the former group, implying that global engagement \nhelps firms to overcome liquidity constraints. \nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some \neconomic background for our analysis, and illustrates our baseline specification and our \n                                                 \n6 Within a Q model of investment framework, Cummins et al. (2006) show that financial variables such as \ncash flow could enter significantly in an investment regression simply because they pick up investment \nopportunities which are not properly accounted for by Tobin\u2019s Q. \n5 \neconometric methodology. In Section 3, we describe our data and present some descriptive \nstatistics. Section 4 illustrates our main empirical results, and Section 5 concludes. \n \n2. Economic background, baseline specification, and estimation methodology \nEconomic background \nOur baseline specification is motivated by a generalization of Kashyap et al.\u2019s (1993) \nframework, which focuses on financial composition and its effects on firms\u2019 real activities. \nKashyap et al. (1993) assume that firms can finance their investment projects in two ways: \neither by using bank loans or by issuing commercial paper. To measure financial \ncomposition, they introduce a \u201cmix\u201d variable, defined as the ratio of bank loans to the sum \nof bank loans and commercial paper. They show that the \u201cmix\u201d is an important determinant \nof both inventory investment and investment in fixed capital. In other words, the \navailability of bank credit has a positive impact on fixed capital and inventory \naccumulation, as firms cannot perfectly substitute bank loans with commercial paper. \nBecause, in the UK, the commercial paper market is not particularly developed, we \nconsider another leading short-term substitute for bank loans, namely trade credit. \nSpecifically, we use an alternative \u201cmix\u201d variable (labelled MIX), defined as the ratio of the \nfirm\u2019s short-term debt to the sum of its short-term debt and trade credit, where short-term \ndebt is essentially made up of bank loans, and trade credit is a form of financing \nautomatically created when customers delay payment of their bills to their suppliers.  \nThe inclusion of trade credit in our \u201cmix\u201d variable is motivated by the fact that this \nform of financing is widely used7. For instance, Rajan and Zingales (1995) document that \nin 1991, funds loaned to customers represented 17.8% of total assets for US firms, 22% for \nUK firms, and more than 25% for countries such as Italy, France, and Germany. Similarly, \naccording to Kohler et al. (2000), 55% of the total short-term credit received by UK firms \nduring the period 1983-95 took the form of trade credit. As suppliers can closely monitor \n                                                 \n7 Kashyap et al. (1993) themselves acknowledge the importance of considering trade credit as a short-term \nsubstitute for bank credit (footnote 19, p. 88). Yet, they are unable to use it in their empirical analysis, which \nis based on aggregate data.  \n6 \ntheir clients during the normal course of business, trade credit is available to most firms8. \nYet, it is typically more expensive than bank credit, as customers generally do not use the \nearly payment discount (Petersen and Rajan, 1997)9. \nIn summary, bank lending is generally available to most firms at a reasonable cost, \nwhile trade credit is also widely available, but much more expensive. Consequently, \nespecially for those firms more likely to face financing constraints, these two forms of \nfinancing are not perfect substitutes, and the proportion of financing that they obtain from \nbanks is likely to affect their activities.  \nAs in Kashyap et al. (1993), Hoshi et al. (1993), and Huang (2003), we include our \nMIX variable in inventory investment regressions. We then examine whether the effect of \nthis variable on inventory investment differs across firms a priori more and less likely to \nface financial constraints in a traditional sense; and across globally engaged and purely \ndomestic firms. We interpret the sensitivity of inventory investment to MIX displayed by \nour firms as a measure of the strength of the financial constraints that they face10. A strong \npositive association between inventory accumulation and MIX indicates that having easy \naccess to cheaper and more widely available bank finance facilitates inventory investment, \nprobably because trade credit is too expensive for some firms. We expect the association to \nbe stronger for firms a priori more likely to face financing constraints in a traditional sense, \nand for purely domestic firms11.  \n \n \n                                                 \n8 According to Elliehausen and Wolken (1993), more than 80% of the US firms covered in the National \nSurvey of Small Business Finances used trade credit in 1987.  \n9 A common form of trade credit contract is known as the \u201c2\/10 net 30\u201d type. \u201c2\/10\u201d means that the buyer gets \na 2% discount for payment within 10 days. \u201cNet 30\u201d means that full payment is due 30 days after the invoice \ndate. After that date, the customer is in default. The combination of a 2% discount for payment within 10 days \nand a net period ending on day 30 defines an implicit interest rate of 43.9%, which can be seen as the \nopportunity cost to the buyer to forgo the discount in exchange for 20 additional days of financing (Petersen \nand Rajan, 1997). \n10 Contrary to Kashyap et al. (1993), Hoshi et al. (1993), and Huang (2003), we do not analyze how MIX (or \nthe sensitivity of inventory investment to this variable) behaves in periods of recession and\/or tight monetary \npolicy. This is because our data set spans the years 1993-2003, which was a recession-free period in the UK.  \n11 All our results were robust to using a broader \u201cmix\u201d variable defined as the ratio of the firm\u2019s short-term \ndebt to its total current liabilities (which include corporate bonds, commercial paper, and loans from finance \nand insurance companies, in addition to bank loans and trade credit). \n7 \nBaseline specification \nThe baseline specification that we use is a variant of Lovell\u2019s target adjustment model \n(1961). Denoting with I and S the logarithms of inventories and sales, the equation for \ninventory growth that we initially estimate takes the following form: \n \nitejtvtvivitMIXtiStiItiSitStiIitI +++++\u2212\u2212\u2212+\u2212\u2206+\u2206+\u2212\u2206+=\u2206 \u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 4)1,1,(31,211,0  (1) \n \nThe subscript i indexes firms; j, industries; and t, time, where t=1995-2003. Differences of \nthe logarithms of sales and inventories are included in the regression to capture the short-\nrun dynamics. The term (Ii,t-1 \u2013 Si,t-1) can be interpreted as reflecting the influence of a long-\nrun target inventory level. This gives the specification an error-correction format. Error-\ncorrection behavior enters the empirical framework because of adjustment costs. In their \npresence, the firm will not immediately adjust its inventory stock to the target level, which \nis assumed to be a function of sales. We specify a dynamic adjustment mechanism between \nI and S (the details of which are contained in Appendix 1). To be consistent with error-\ncorrection behavior, the coefficient associated with the term (Ii,t-1 - Si,t-1) should be negative: \nif the stock of inventories (I) is lower (higher) than the target (S), then future inventory \ninvestment should be higher (lower). \nMIX denotes our financial composition variable12. We interpret the coefficients \nassociated with this variable as a measure of the strength of the financial constraints faced \nby our firms. Specifically, we explore how these coefficients differ across firms classified \ninto financially constrained and unconstrained in a traditional sense (based in turn on size, \nage, and risk), on the one hand; and across globally engaged and purely domestic, on the \nother. In order to determine whether global engagement plays a role in shielding firms from \nfinancial constraints, we compare the coefficients across globally engaged financially \nconstrained firms and purely domestic financially constrained firms13. \n                                                 \n12 MIX is evaluated at time t. This can be motivated by the fact that inventory investment has low adjustment \ncosts, and can therefore quickly react to changes in financial variables (Carpenter et al., 1994, 1998).  \n13 Other studies that estimated reduced-form inventory investment equations considered the sensitivity of \ninventory investment to cash flow as an indicator of the degree of financial constraints faced by firms (Benito, \n8 \nThe error term in Equation (1) is made up of four components: vi, which is a firm-\nspecific component; vt, a time-specific component accounting for possible business cycle \neffects, and more specifically for effects due to changes in interest rates; vjt, a time-specific \ncomponent which varies across industries accounting for industry-specific shifts in \ninventory investment demand; and eit, an idiosyncratic component. We control for vi by \nestimating our equation in first-differences; for vt by including time dummies; and for vjt by \nincluding industry dummies interacted with time dummies in all our specifications14. \n \nEstimation methodology \nAll equations are estimated in first-differences, to control for firm-specific, time-invariant \neffects. Given the possible endogeneity of the regressors, we use a first-difference \nGeneralized Method of Moments (GMM) approach15. Two or more lags of each of the \nregressors are used as instruments.  \nTo check whether the first-difference GMM estimator is likely to suffer from finite \nsample bias, we compared the GMM and the Within Groups estimates of the coefficient on \nthe lagged dependent variable in Equation (1). Because the Within Groups estimate is \ntypically downward biased in short panels (Nickell, 1981), one would expect a consistent \nestimate of the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable to lie above this estimate. As \nour GMM coefficient was larger than its Within Groups counterpart, we concluded that the \nfirst-difference GMM estimates are unlikely to be subject to serious finite sample bias16. \n                                                                                                                                                     \n2005; Carpenter et al., 1994, 1998; and Guariglia, 1999). Cash flow is often negative in our dataset. This is \nbecause our dataset includes a number of very small firms, which are typically very young, and possibly start-\nup firms. As a negative cash flow cannot really be interpreted as a measure of the availability of internal funds \nto the firm, or of the healthiness of the firm\u2019s balance sheet, we preferred not to use this variable in our main \nspecifications. Nevertheless, in Section 4, we check the robustness of our results to adding the cash flow to \ntangible fixed assets ratio to equation (1). \n14 Firms are allocated to one of the following nine industrial sectors: metals and metal goods; other minerals, \nand mineral products; chemicals and man made fibres; mechanical engineering; electrical and instrument \nengineering; motor vehicles and parts, other transport equipment; food, drink, and tobacco; textiles, clothing, \nleather, and footwear; and others (Blundell et al., 1992). Including industry-level time dummies in our \nregressions ensures that the results aimed at differentiating between globally engaged and purely domestic \nfirms are not simply due to cross-industry variations. \n15 See Arellano and Bond (1991) on the application of the GMM approach to panel data. The command \nxtabond2 devised by D. Roodman (2005) in Stata (version 9.2) is used in estimation. \n16 If the estimates obtained using the first-difference GMM estimator lie close or below the Within Groups \nestimates, one could suspect the GMM estimate to be downward biased as well, possibly due to weak \n9 \nIn order to evaluate whether our model is correctly specified, we use two criteria: \nthe Sargan test (also known as J test) and the test for second-order serial correlation of the \nresiduals in the differenced equation (m2). If the model is correctly specified, the variables \nin the instrument set should be uncorrelated with the error term in the relevant equation. \nThe J test is the Sargan test for overidentifying restrictions, which, under the null of \ninstrument validity, is asymptotically distributed as a chi-square with degrees of freedom \nequal to the number of instruments less the number of parameters. The m2 test is \nasymptotically distributed as a standard normal under the null of no second-order serial \ncorrelation of the differenced residuals, and provides a further check on the specification of \nthe model and on the legitimacy of variables dated t-2 as instruments in the differenced \nequation17. \n \n3. Main features of the data and summary statistics \nThe dataset \nOur dataset is derived from the profit and loss and balance sheet data gathered by Bureau \nVan Dijk Electronic Publishing in the Financial Analysis Made Easy (FAME) database. \nThe database provides information on companies over the period 1993-200318. Over 99% \nof the firms included in the dataset are not traded on the stock market, or are quoted on \nalternative exchanges such as the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) and the Off-\nExchange (OFEX) market19. Unquoted firms are more likely to be characterized by adverse \nfinancial attributes such as poor solvency, a short track record, and low real assets \ncompared to quoted firms, which are typically large, long-established, financially solid \ncompanies with good credit ratings. Our data allows us therefore to find proxies for \n                                                                                                                                                     \ninstruments. In such case, the use of a GMM system estimator (which combines in a system the original \nspecification expressed in first differences and in levels) would be required (Blundell and Bond, 1998). \n17 If the undifferenced error terms are i.i.d., then the differenced residuals should display first-order, but not \nsecond-order serial correlation. In our Tables, we report both the test for first-order (m1) and the test for \nsecond-order (m2) serial correlation of the differenced residuals. Note that neither the J test nor the m2 test \nallow to discriminate between bad instruments and model specification.  \n18 A maximum of ten years of complete data history can be downloaded at once. Our data were downloaded \nearly in 2004: the coverage period is therefore 1993-2003.  \n19 We only selected firms that have unconsolidated accounts: this ensures that the majority of the firms in our \ndataset are relatively small. Moreover, it avoids the double counting of firms belonging to groups, which \nwould be included in the dataset if firms with consolidated accounts were also part of it. \n10\n \nfinancial constraints, characterized by a wide range of variation across observations in the \nsample. This allows us to perform sharper tests for the existence of financing constraints \nthan those performed in the inventory investment literature, where datasets made up only of \nquoted firms were generally used (Carpenter et al., 1994, 1998; Guariglia, 1999; Huang, \n2003 etc.). \nThe firms in our dataset operate in the manufacturing sector. We excluded \ncompanies that changed the date of their accounting year-end by more than a few weeks, so \nthat the data refer to twelve month accounting periods. Firms that did not have complete \nrecords on total inventories, sales, and MIX were also dropped. Finally, to control for the \npotential influence of outliers, we excluded observations in the one percent tails for each of \nthe regression variables. \nThe panel used in our analysis includes therefore a total of 40949 annual \nobservations on 9381 companies, covering the years 1993-2003. It has an unbalanced \nstructure, with the number of years of observations on each firm varying between three and \neleven20. By allowing for both entry and exit, the use of an unbalanced panel partially \nmitigates potential selection and survivor bias. \n \nSample separation criteria  \nIn order to evaluate whether the sensitivity of inventory investment to our financial \ncomposition variable differs at different groups of firms, we use two groups of sample \nseparation criteria. The first group of criteria is aimed at classifying firms into financially \nconstrained and financially unconstrained, and is based in turn on three traditionally used \nfirm characteristics: size, age, and risk. We measure firm size using, alternatively, firm \nsales and its number of employees. Smaller and younger firms are susceptible to \ninformation asymmetry effects, since little public information is available for them, and it is \ndifficult for financial institutions to gather this information. Obtaining external finance is \n                                                 \n20 See Appendix 2 for more information on the structure of our panel and complete definitions of all variables \nused. Since a number of regressors are lagged once and since we estimate our equations in first differences, \nthe dataset actually used in estimation only covers the years 1995-2003. \n11\n \ntherefore likely to be particularly difficult and\/or costly for them (Bernanke and Gertler, \n1995)21.  \nSimilar considerations apply to risky firms. Our dataset includes a variable \nmeasuring the firm\u2019s risk (labelled \u201cQuiscore\u201d), which is based on information about the \ncredit ratings of the firm. It is an indicator which measures the likelihood of company \nfailure in the twelve months following the date of calculation. The lower its Quiscore value, \nthe more risky a firm is considered. This is a wider definition of perceived financial health \nthan the commonly used bond rating, which only applies to a small fraction of rated firms \n(Whited, 1992; Kashyap and Stein, 1994). \nWe consider the situation of each firm relative to that of other firms in the industry \nin which that firm operates. For example, when using firm size measured by sales as a \nsample separation criterion, we define as financially constrained within an industry in a \ngiven year those observations with total sales in the bottom three quartiles of the \ndistribution of the sales of all the firms in that particular industry and year.22 A similar \nprocedure is used when observations are classified as financially constrained on the basis of \ntheir number of employees, age, or Quiscore. In this way, we allow firms to transit between \nclasses. Our empirical analysis will hence focus on firm-years rather than simply firms. We \nexpect firm-years that are financially constrained in a traditional sense to display higher \nsensitivities of inventory investment to our financial variable. \nOur second group of criteria is based on global engagement variables. In particular, \nwe consider as globally engaged those firms that export, or are foreign owned. Because \nthey have access to both internal and international markets, are less tied to the domestic \nbusiness cycle, and have been able to afford the sunk costs necessary to enter export \nmarkets, we expect globally engaged firms to face a lower degree of financial constraints \n                                                 \n21 Note that a financially constrained firm is not necessarily financially distressed. Firms that face constraints \nat the margin could in fact be dynamic, fast-growing enterprises that exhaust their supply of cheap sources of \nfunds, and hence need large amounts of external finance. \n22 Classifying firms in the bottom three quartiles of the distribution of sales, number of employees, age, or \nQuiscore as financially constrained is motivated by the fact that our sample is mainly made up of unquoted \nfirms, and contains a majority of relatively small firms with short track records, which are highly likely to \nface financing constraints. All our results were robust to using 70% or 80% as alternative cut-off points. \n12\n \ncompared to their purely domestic counterparts, and therefore to exhibit lower sensitivities \nof inventory investment to our financial composition variable. \n \nSummary statistics \nDescriptive statistics relative to our entire sample and various sub-samples of firm-years are \npresented in Table 1. Column 1 refers to the entire sample, columns 2 to 9 to the sub-\nsamples of financially constrained and unconstrained firm-years defined on the basis of \ntraditional criteria; and columns 10 to 13 to the sub-samples defined on the basis of the \nglobal engagement criteria23.  \nWe can see that on average 74.4% of the firm-years in our sample participate in \nexport markets, and that 46.2% of them are foreign owned: this indicates that global \nengagement is quite pervasive in our sample. \nIt appears that firm-years with high sales and older firm-years are also larger in \nterms of asset size and employment. Similarly, firm-years characterized by positive exports \nare typically larger than firm-years that do not export. Relatively risky and relatively safe, \nand foreign owned versus purely domestic firm-years do not differ too much in terms of \nasset size and number of employees.  \nFocusing on our financial composition variable, we can see that the average value of \nMIX is 0.51. This indicates that bank lending constitutes more than half of the firm\u2019s short \nterm finance. Furthermore, MIX is higher for more risky, larger, as well as for globally \nengaged firm-years. The difference in the average values of this financial variable is \nparticularly pronounced between relatively risky and safe firm-years. This suggests that \nhighly bank-dependent firms are more at risk from bankruptcy compared to other firms: \nthese firms are therefore more likely to face financial constraints. Yet, the fact that MIX is \nhigher for larger firms suggests that a high bank-dependence can also be associated with \ngood financial health. However, what really points to financial constraints is not the \n                                                 \n23 Note that the global engagement variables are characterized by a number of missing values. This is due to \nthe fact that not all firms are required to report their export turnover, and\/or whether they are foreign owned. \n13\n \nmagnitude of MIX, but the effect that this variable has on firms\u2019 inventory accumulation. \nThe next section formally investigates this link.  \n \n4. Empirical results \nThe estimates of Equation (1) are reported in the first column of Table 224. Lagged \ninventory investment attracts a negative and precisely determined coefficient; both current \nand lagged sales growth affect inventory investment positively; and the coefficient on the \nerror correction term is negative and precisely determined. Moreover, the coefficient on the \nMIX variable is positive and statistically significant. This indicates that the higher the \nproportion of bank credit used by firms relative to trade credit, the more the firm can invest \nin inventories. More specifically, if MIX increased by one standard deviation, inventory \ninvestment would rise by 5.2%. This effect, which is consistent with the findings in \nKashyap et al. (1993) and Hoshi et al. (1993), is economically significant. \nIn column 2 of Table 2, we test whether our results are robust to including the ratio \nof cash flow to tangible fixed assets as an additional regressor in our specification25. This \nexercise is motivated by the fact that a number of authors (Carpenter and Petersen, 1994, \n1998; Guariglia, 1999; Benito, 2005) have found that cash flow is a significant determinant \nof inventory investment. We can see that adding the ratio of cash flow to tangible fixed \nassets to our equation leads to a larger coefficient associated with MIX. This confirms that \nhaving access to bank finance is important for inventory investment.  \nYet, the cash flow ratio has an insignificant impact on inventory investment. This \ncould be explained considering the contrasting effects that cash flow may have on inventory \ninvestment. On the one hand, when demand increases, cash flow increases, but firms may \nneed to reduce their stocks of inventories to satisfy the increased demand. This may lead to \na negative relationship between inventory investment and cash flow. On the other hand, \nfirms with higher cash flow can afford to increase their stocks of inventories, implying a \n                                                 \n24 We report first-stage GMM estimates, which according to Arellano and Bond (1991), are likely to have \nbetter small-sample properties. The two-step estimates were, however, very similar. \n25 For the reasons discussed in footnote 13, we drop from our sample firms with more than three consecutive \nyears of negative cash flow. This explains the lower number of observations in column 2 of Table 2 compared \nto column 1. \n14\n \npositive inventory investment - cash flow relationship. If of similar magnitudes, these two \nopposing effects could offset each other, leading to an insignificant cash flow coefficient. \nAnother reason why our cash flow variable may attract a poorly determined coefficient is \nthat cash flow and sales may be highly collinear, making it difficult to estimate the relevant \ncoefficients (Bagliano and Sembenelli, 2004)26. In both columns of Table 2, neither the \nSargan nor the m2 test indicate any problems with the choice of instruments or the general \nspecification of the model. \nWe next estimate the following specification, in which the effects of MIX are \ndifferentiated across firm-years more and less likely to face financial constraints in a \ntraditional sense: \n \nitejtvtvivitCONSitMIXitCONSitMIX\ntiStiItiSitStiIitI\n++++\u2212++\n+\u2212\u2212\u2212+\u2212\u2206+\u2206+\u2212\u2206+=\u2206\n)1(*42*41                \n)1,1,(31,211,0\n\u03b2\u03b2\n\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\n  (2) \n \nCONSit is a dummy variable equal to 1 if firm i is financially constrained at time t, and \nequal to 0 otherwise27.  \nTable 3 presents the estimates of Equation (2). In columns 1 to 4, traditional \nfinancial constraints are measured respectively on the basis of the firms\u2019 sales, number of \nemployees, age, and credit risk. We can see that in all cases, the coefficients associated with \nMIX are statistically significant only for constrained firm-years. This result is in line with \nCarpenter et al. (1994, 1998), Guariglia (1999), and Benito (2005). \n                                                 \n26 Given the insignificance of the cash flow coefficient, in the Tables that follow we only report the results \nbased on MIX. All our results were robust to including cash flow as an additional regressor. These results are \nnot reported for brevity, but are available on request. \n27 We prefer to use interaction terms rather than splitting the sample into sub-groups of firms and estimating \nseparate regressions for each of the sub-groups, as this enables us to avoid problems of endogenous sample \nselection, to gain degrees of freedom, and to take into consideration the fact that firms can transit between \ngroups. See Kaplan and Zingales (1997) for a similar approach. All our results were, however, robust to \nestimating separate regressions on separate sub-samples of firms defined as financially \nconstrained\/unconstrained on the one hand, and globally engaged\/purely domestic on the other, on the basis of \nthe average of the chosen sample separation variable taken over the entire sample, or over the first three years \nof data. These results are not reported for brevity, but are available on request.  \n15\n \nOur next specification looks at whether, compared to their purely domestic \ncounterparts, globally engaged firms display lower sensitivities of inventory investment to \nMIX. The Equation that we estimate for this purpose takes the following form: \n \nitejtvtvivitGEitMIXitGEitMIX\ntiStiItiSitStiIitI\n+++++\u2212+\n+\u2212\u2212\u2212+\u2212\u2206+\u2206+\u2212\u2206+=\u2206\n*42)1(*41                \n)1,1,(31,211,0\n\u03b2\u03b2\n\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\n  (3) \n \nwhere GEit is a dummy variable equal to 1 if firm i has positive exports in year t and\/or is \nforeign owned in year t, and 0 otherwise.  \nOur estimates of Equation (3) are presented in Table 4. Column 1 refers to the case \nin which global engagement is measured on the basis of whether the firm exports, and \ncolumn 2 to the case in which it is measured on the basis of whether the firm is foreign \nowned. It appears that MIX has a significant coefficient only for purely domestic firms. \nThese results are in line with Arbel\u00e1ez and Echavarr\u00eda (2002), Campa and Shaver (2002), \nHarrison and McMillan (2003), and Mickiewicz et al. (2004), and suggest that both \ndimensions of global engagement are associated with a lower degree of financial \nconstraints. \nFinally, pushing our analysis one step further, we propose a direct test for whether \nglobal engagement reduces the severity of the liquidity constraints that financially \nconstrained firms may face. More specifically, we test whether the sensitivity of inventory \ninvestment to our MIX variable is lower for those financially constrained firms that are \nglobally engaged compared to their domestic counterparts. We estimate the following \nEquation: \n \nitejtvtvivitCONSitMIX\nitGEitCONSitMIXitGEitCONSitMIX\ntiStiItiSitStiIitI\n++++\u2212+\n++\u2212+\n+\u2212\u2212\u2212+\u2212\u2206+\u2206+\u2212\u2206+=\u2206\n)1(*42                \n**412)1(**411                \n)1,1,(31,211,0\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\u03b2\n\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\n  (4) \n \n16\n \nTable 5 presents the estimates of Equation (4) when global engagement is \nmeasured in terms of export behavior. As in Table 3, in columns 1 to 4, firm-years are split \ninto financially constrained and unconstrained in a traditional sense, using respectively \nfirms\u2019 sales, number of employees, age, and credit risk as sorting criteria. We can see that \nMIX only affects inventory investment at those financially constrained firm-years that do \nnot export, suggesting therefore that serving foreign as well as domestic markets plays an \nimportant role in dampening the effects of liquidity constraints for small, young, and more \nrisky firms. Finally, the J and m2 tests do not indicate any problems with the specification \nof the model and the choice of the instruments. \nWe perform a similar exercise using foreign ownership as a measure of global \nengagement. It appears that only those financially constrained firm-years that are purely \ndomestic display a positive sensitivity of inventory investment to our financial composition \nvariable. So, just like serving foreign markets through exports, being foreign owned \nreduces the severity of the financial constraints that a firm faces. These results are not \nreported for brevity but are available on request. \n \n5. Conclusions \nWe have used a panel of 9381 UK firms over the period 1993-2003 to study the links \nbetween firms\u2019 global engagement status and their financial health. We have estimated \nerror-correction inventory investment equations augmented with a financial composition \nvariable, MIX, defined as the firm\u2019s ratio of short-term debt to short-term debt plus trade \ncredit. We have then analyzed the differential effects of MIX on the inventory accumulation \nof firms more and less likely to face financial constraints in a traditional sense, on the one \nhand; and of globally engaged versus purely domestic firms, on the other.  \nIn line with previous studies, our results suggest that MIX only affects inventory \ninvestment at firms that are financially constrained in a traditional sense (i.e. small, young, \nand risky firms). Moving beyond existing literature, we also found that inventory \naccumulation at globally engaged firms is not sensitive to MIX, whereas inventory \n17\n \ninvestment at purely domestic firms is. This suggests that global engagement is associated \nwith a lower degree of financial constraints.  \nFinally, we have directly tested whether global engagement plays a role in \nattenuating the liquidity constraints faced by smaller, younger, and more risky firms. For \nthis purpose we have analysed the effects of MIX on the inventory investment of purely \ndomestic financially constrained firms, globally engaged financially constrained firms, and \nfinancially unconstrained firms. We found that our financial variable only has a statistically \nsignificant effect on the inventory investment of the former category. We interpreted this as \nevidence that global engagement shields firms from liquidity constraints.  \nFrom a policy viewpoint, these results suggest that export promotion policies and \npolicies providing incentives to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) may be beneficial to the \neconomy, not only through their well-known direct growth-enhancing role, but also \nbecause they are likely to reduce the level of financial constraints faced by firms, and \nconsequently to indirectly enhance their investment spending and productivity. The latter \neffect is particularly relevant for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), whose \ninvestment is often constrained by the lack of finance. \n \nAppendix 1: The error-correction inventory model \nThe baseline error-correction specification which is estimated (Equation 1) can be seen as a \ngeneralization of Lovell\u2019s target adjustment model (1961). The target-adjustment model is \nbased on the hypothesis that each firm has a desired target level of inventories, and that a \nfirm finding its actual level of inventories different from its target level attempts only a \npartial adjustment towards the target level within any one period. As discussed in Lovel \n(1961, pp. 295-296), this partial adjustment could be due to the fact that there are costs \ninvolved in changing the level of stocks. Moreover, there could be problems related with \nthe heterogeneous nature of stocks and\/or the infrequent intervals at which certain goods \nare ordered. \n18\n \nWe assume that the target stock of inventories of firm i at time t (Iit*) is related to \nthe volume of sales in that period (Sit) via the following Equation, where the variables are \nexpressed in logarithms: \nI it* = \u03b1 + \u03b2 S it          (A1) \n\u03b2 is the marginal desired stock coefficient, which can also be seen as an accelerator effect: \nif sales are expected to increase, then the target stock of inventories will also increase. \nDenoting the logarithm of the actual stock of inventories of firm i at time t with Iit, \nand assuming that the actual inventory investment \u2206Iit is a fraction \u03b4 of the required \ninvestment necessary for the firm to adjust its stocks to the equilibrium level, we can write \n\u2206I it = I it - Ii, t-1= \u03b4 (Iit* - I i, t-1) = \u03b4\u03b1 + \u03b4\u03b2 S it - \u03b4 I i, t-1     (A2) \nThis yields: \nI it = \u03b4\u03b1 + \u03b4\u03b2Sit + (1-\u03b4) I i, t-1        (A3) \nWe then nest Equation (A3) within a general dynamic regression model, which accounts for \nthe slow adjustment of the actual stock of inventories to the desired stock. We consider an \nautoregressive distributed lag specification with up to second-order dynamics (i.e. an \nADL(2,2) model). This leads to: \nIit = \u03b21 I i, t-1+\u03b22 I i, t-2+\u03b23Sit + \u03b24 S i, t-1+\u03b25 S i, t-2+ \u03bdi + vjt + \u03bdt + eit    (A4) \nThe presence of lagged variables makes allowance for the fact that data are not observed in \na state of equilibrium. We include a firm-specific effect (\u03bdi), an industry-specific time effect \n(vjt), and a regular time-specific effect (\u03bdt). Together with the idiosyncratic component, eit, \nthese make up the error term of Equation (A4). We also impose the parameter restriction \n(\u03b23 + \u03b24 + \u03b25)\/(1 - \u03b21 - \u03b22) = 1, aimed at ensuring a long-run equilibrium behavior of the \nstock of inventories relative to sales. Imposing this long-run unit elasticity and \nreparameterizing the ADL model we can express Equation (A4) in an error-correction \nformat: \n\u2206I it =-\u03b22 \u2206I i, t-1 + \u03b23\u2206Sit - \u03b25 \u2206Si, t-1 \u2013 (1- \u03b21 - \u03b22) (Ii,t-1 -Si,t-1)+ \u03bdi + \u03bdjt + \u03bdt + eit  (A5) \nwhere (Ii,t-1-Si,t-1) represents the error-correction term. According to this equation, \ninventories are partially adjusted to current and past changes in sales, but in the long-run, \nthey are kept approximately in line with sales. To be consistent with error-correction \n19\n \nbehavior, the coefficient associated with the (Ii,t-1 -Si,t-1) term should be negative: if the \nstock of inventories moves further from (closer to) its desired level, future inventory \ninvestment should be higher (lower).  \nWe further augment our model with a financial composition variable, MIX, which \naim at picking up financial effects on inventory investment. This yields Equation (1) in the \npaper.  \n \nAppendix 2: Data \n \nStructure of the unbalanced panel: \n \n \nNumber of obs. \nper firm \n \nNumber of \nfirms \n \nPercent \n \nCumulative \n3 21 0.22 0.22 \n4 259 2.76 2.98 \n5 449 4.79 7.77 \n6 561 5.98 13.75 \n7 655 6.98 20.73 \n8 962 10.25 30.99 \n9 2212 23.58 54.57 \n10 4258 45.39 99.96 \n11 4 0.04 100.00 \nTotal 9381 100.00  \n \nDefinitions of the variables used: \nInventories: includes finished goods and work-in-process inventories. \nSales: includes both UK and overseas turnover. \nTotal assets: the sum of the firm\u2019s fixed and current assets. \nExport: dummy variable equal to 1 if the firm exports a positive amount, and 0 otherwise. \nForeign: dummy equal to 1 if the firm is foreign owned, and 0 otherwise. To be considered \nas foreign owned, the share of foreign ownership in a firm\u2019s equity must exceed 24.99%. \nThis dummy variable is only available in the last year of observations available for each \nfirm. We therefore assume that a firm which was foreign owned in its last available year \nwas foreign owned throughout the period in which it was observed. Given the short sample \nthat we analyze, this is a reasonable assumption. Actual data on the share of foreign \nownership in a firm\u2019s equity are only available for a very limited number of observations. \n20\n \nMIX: ratio of short-term debt to short-term debt plus trade credit. Short-term debt includes \nthe following items: bank overdrafts, short-term group and director loans, hire purchase, \nleasing, and other short-term loans, but it is predominantly bank finance. \nCFTA: ratio of cash flow to tangible fixed assets. Cash flow is defined as the sum of profit\/ \nloss for the period (after tax and interest) and depreciation. \nQuiscore: indicator produced by Qui Credit Assessment Ltd, which measures the likelihood \nof company failure in the twelve months following the date of calculation. Quiscore is \ngiven as a number in the range from 0 to 100. The lower its Quiscore, the more risky a firm \nis likely to be. The indicator is constructed taking into account a number of factors, \nincluding the presence of any adverse documents appearing against the company on the \npublic file, and the timeliness of getting the accounts filed. However, the most important \nfactors relate to the financial performance of the company as evidenced by its balance sheet \nand profit and loss accounts. The key financial items used include turnover, pre-tax profits, \nworking capital, intangibles, cash and bank deposits, creditors, bank loans and overdrafts, \ncurrent assets, current liabilities, net assets, fixed assets, share capital, reserves and \nshareholders funds. The underlying economic conditions are also taken into account. \nDeflators: all variables are deflated using the aggregate GDP deflator. \n \nReferences \nArbel\u00e1ez, M., Echavarr\u00eda, J., 2002.
