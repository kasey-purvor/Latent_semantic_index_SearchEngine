Introduction\n[2] The successful launch of the DEMETER satellite\non 29 June 2004 from Baikonur (Kazakhstan) established\nan important opportunity to investigate the different\nULF\u2010VLF phenomena appearing in the Earth\u2019s plasma envi-\nronment. After a successful calibration of the satellite instru-\nments the regular operation started in September 2004. The\ninclination of the nearly circular orbit low Earth orbit is 98\u00b0\nCentre National d\u2019Etudes Spatiales, Toulouse, France\nDEMETER data server (available at http:\/\/demeter.cnrs\u2010\norleans.fr). (Starting orbit altitude was \u223c710 km, and it\nwas decreased to \u223c660 km in December 2005. During the\ninvestigated period the orbit altitude was \u223c710 km.) The\nmain purpose of the satellite is to provide a solid database\nto investigate possible electromagnetic effects of the earth-\nquakes in the ionosphere before the seismic shock. On board\nthe satellite two wave experiments are relevant to our inves-\ntigation: the Instrumental Champ Electrique electric field in-\nstrument operating in DC\u2010HF bands from DC to 3.175 MHz\n[Berthelier et al., 2006], and the IMSC magnetic field exper-\niment operating in VLF band from a few Hz to 17.4 kHz\n[Parrot et al., 2006]. These experiments have two basic\nmodes of operation. In the survey mode only the power\nspectra are stored, while in burst mode the full signal wave-\nforms (the recorded raw signals) and the power spectra are\nstored and transmitted to the tracking stations. Burst mode\nis employed above previously defined, seismically active\nregions of the Earth.\n[3] According to the primary objective of the DEMETER\nexperiment our aim has been to detect and to investigate\nanomalous signal patterns on VLF recordings applying high\ntemporal resolution wave analysis. This paper reports an\nunusual whistler\u2010like phenomenon observed clearly by\nDEMETER. Here we characterize the features of the wave-\nforms, compare them against known VLF signals, and we\ninvestigate the possible occurrence of this type of events\nin earlier satellite data and in ground\u2010based measurements.\n2. Data and Methods\n[4] In this study the burst mode VLF data were used. In\nthe completed first phase of our investigation a 5 month\nlong (September 2004 to January 2005) recording and\nthe preoperational stage data (July\u2013August 2004) have been\n1Space Research Group, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s University, Budapest, Hungary.\n2MTA-ELTE Research Group for Geology, Geophysics and Space\nSciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary.\n3LPCE, Universite\u00b4 d\u2019Orle\u00b4ans, CNRS, Orl\u00e9ans, France.\n4CETP, Observatoire de Saint Maur, Saint Maur des Foss\u00e9s, France.\n5British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2009JA014636$09.00\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, A02210, doi:10.1029\/2009JA014636, 2010\nA02210 1 of 10\nsurveyed systematically in a geographically confined region\nwith latitudes = 30\u00b0\u201353\u00b0N and longitudes = 5\u00b0\u201333\u00b0E (L =\n1.26\u20132.65). This search region was chosen with respect to\ncontinuous ground\u2010based wideband VLF recordings collect-\ned in France and Hungary. Simultaneously to this review a\nselected 2 month long (December 2004 to January 2005)\ntime interval has been checked thoroughly. During the sys-\ntematic survey, each satellite pass crossing the region spec-\nified above was analyzed. The analyzed data cover 36 h long\nrecordings in this 7 month period, we have found \u201cswallow\u2010\ntailed whistlers\u201d (STWs) in several data sections, which are\n6.5 min long altogether. Analysis of randomly selected\nadditional, more than 10 h recording, acquired in burst mode\nglobally elsewhere made this investigation more complete in\nlatitudes (L\u2010shells).\n[5] For the analysis of the data a conventional fast Fourier\ntransform dynamic spectrum with a window size of 12.8 ms\nand 50% overlap, reassigned spectrogram and matched fil-\ntering were used.\n3. Observed Phenomenon\n[6] During the analysis of the ICE and IMSC signals a\nstrange shaped, whistler like phenomenon was found. This\ntype of signals, termed here as \u201cswallow\u2010tailed whistler\u201d\n(STW), have whistler character, exhibiting strong signal\ntrace furcation on broadband spectra with a swallow\u2010tailed\nshape (Figures 1 and 3). The signals have clear contours.\nThe conventional spectrogram is not able to show every\ncharacteristic parts of the signal structure in details, thus\ntwo other modes of visualization were used throughout the\npaper: the reassigned spectrogram [Auger and Flandrin,\n1995] and matched filtering [Hamar and Tarcsai, 1982].\nThe three different ways of visualization of the STW phe-\nnomena ensure that the observed characteristic pattern is\nreal, because it appears on all the three plots.\n[7] In the spectrogram, individual STWs appear as a whis-\ntler (hereafter referred to as main trace, e.g., trace \u201cm\u201d in\nFigure 1d) accompanied with a secondary monotonically\nchanging frequency signal part (e.g., trace \u201cs\u201d in Figure 1d)\njoined at a given Starting Furcation Frequency (SFF). The\nsecondary trace appears as sharp as the main trace in the spec-\ntrogram, also exhibits dispersion and can be traced for less\nthan 80 ms within the recorded VLF bandwidth. The ampli-\ntudes of the secondary trace are typically similar or larger than\nthose of the main trace. The secondary trace does not have a\nclear, whistler\u2010like character as the main trace has, moreover,\nsome fine structural elements, i.e., irregularities appear along\nthe secondary trace (see e.g., the arrows in Figures 1d, 1e, and\n1f). It is important to emphasize that the terms \u201cmain trace\u201d\nand \u201csecondary trace\u201d used hereafter are nomenclature terms\nonly for the features what we see in the spectrogram and at the\nmoment it is not possible to determine if they correspond to a\nsingle or different modes of propagation.\n[8] Analysis of several STWs, detected above Europe\nalong the geographical latitudinal range 30.9\u00b0\u201351.3\u00b0N\nshowed that the dispersion values (D0) of their main traces\nvaried between 22 s1\/2 and 32 s1\/2 measured at the L values\nof 1.8\u20132.1. (Geomagnetic coordinates are given in Tables 1\nand 2.) These D0 values differ from the dispersion values of\nthe simultaneously appearing short\u2010path fractional hop\nwhistlers and one hope whistlers (Figure 1). For example,\nafter the STW series in Figure 1b (orbit number 1547) in\n16 October 2004, 2056:07.1 UT (at 721.1 km height, geo-\ngraphical latitude 46.17\u00b0N, longitude 10.76\u00b0E, L = 2.1) or\nat the beginning of the STW series recorded on the orbit\nnumber 2187 in 29 November 2004, 2108:21 UT (at 720\nkm height, geographical latitude 45.2\u00b0N, longitude 8.1\u00b0E,\nL = 2.07) simultaneous appeared (Figure 2) short\u2010path frac-\ntional hop whistlers (D0 \u2248 1.92 s1\/2), STWs (D0 \u2248 25.4 s1\/2)\nand most probably one hop whistlers (D0 \u2265 60.0 s1\/2). The\nmagnetic latitude corresponding to the satellite position\n(L = 2.1 or 2.07) and the low and medium magnetic activity\nbefore the data acquisitions containing STWs (filled plasma-\nsphere) yield one\u2010hop whistlers with D0 = 50\u223c80 s1\/2, thus\nthe main trace of the STWs could not be one\u2010hop traces.\nHowever, oblique propagation of a fractional hop whistler\nmay lead to such a dispersion [Ferencz et al., 2001].\n[9] So far we have found characteristic and unambiguous\nSTW series in three different periods of the analyzed\n7 month data set recorded above the previously described\nselected region (Figure 4 and Table 1). Thus, clear STW\nperiods are rather rare. However, it was possible to detect\nten groups of less intense, fragmental STWs with more\ndetailed analysis in a 2 month recording, in December\n2004 and January 2005 (see their summary in Table 2).\n[10] Although before and after the periods of STW occur-\nrences many conventional whistlers appear, during the STW\noccurrences all whistlers, having similar D0 dispersion as\nthe STW\u2019s main trace are found to be swallow tailed. Note\nthat short\u2010path, fractional\u2010hop whistlers (D0 < 5 s\n1\/2,\nreached the satellite almost vertically), merged with faint,\nuncertain occurrence of STWs were seen without exhibiting\nSTW character (see e.g., in Figures 1b and 3). Very few\nwhistlers with much larger dispersions than the dispersion\nof the main traces of the actual STWs, most probably one\nhop signals, were also seen without any STW character\n(Figure 2). Based on the limited number of observed STWs\nit can be said that the STW pattern appears gradually in its\nintensity at the beginning of an STW series and disappears\nin the electromagnetic background, finishing a sequence.\nThe appearance rate of individual STWs is like the typical\nappearance rate of whistlers otherwise. Within one STW\nperiod the distinct signals exhibit similar shapes, with some\nremarkable alterations.\n[11] 1. The SFF decreases monotonously with recording\ntime (and because the satellite moved Northward, it\ndecreases with increasing L\u2010value, Table 1), with a rate of\n0.18\u20130.25 kHz\/s along the orbits shown in Figure 4, the sin-\ngle frequency (SFF) at which the two traces deviate varied\nbetween about 17.5 kHz and 4 kHz in the detected exam-\nples, see more in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 5; Table 2; and in sec-\ntion 4. For example the SFF of the STWs appeared in the\norbit 1547 (up) seen in Figure 4, decreased monotonously\nfrom 17.5 kHz to 4.5 kHz. Note that a confirmed general\nbehavior of SFF values according to geomagnetic coordi-\nnates, L value, local time, geomagnetic activity and satellite\norbit direction cannot be drawn based on the analyzed data\nset.\n[12] 2. In some cases the secondary trace in the spectro-\ngram appears as to be rotated to the left around the SFF with\nthe simultaneous decrease of SFF, i.e., the dispersion of the\nsecondary trace increases together with the dispersion of the\nmain trace (see Figure 5).\nFERENCZ ET AL.: UNUSUAL SIGNATURE IN DEMETER VLF DATA A02210A02210\n2 of 10\n[13] The few representative examples of STW occur-\nrences presented above were all derived from the electric\nICE burst VLF data of DEMETER experiment. Magnetic\nVLF recordings, because of the lower sensibility of the\nIMSC instrument (see the amplitudes comparing to noise\nbackground in Figure 6), did not show in most cases the ef-\nfect itself, like in the case of the whistlers, or other typical\nVLF signatures with comparable intensity which appeared\non ICE recordings in the analyzed time periods. Note that\nin case of very strong signals both ICE and IMSC sensors\nmay detect the same STW, with different sensitivity and\nS\/N ratio (see example in Figure 6), thus they are electro-\nmagnetic events.\nFigure 1.

Discussion\n[15] A possible explanation of these strange signals could\nbe related to the artificial effects of the satellite itself: on-\nboard electric instruments might cause unwanted or inten-\ntional emissions, e.g., in active experiments like the\nintense HF Langmuir probe on DEMETER satellite (data\nuser guide by D. Lagoutte et al., http:\/\/demeter.cnrs\u2010\norleans.fr\/dmt\/doc\/dmt_data_user_guide_10.zip). In the\nmodified plasma environment of the satellite a weak VLF\nsignal might also trigger emissions. However, it is unlikely\nthat STWs are of this origin. The Langmuir impulses with\n1 s periodicity are always present, while in the infrequent\noccurrence of the STW sequences no periodicity can be rec-\nognized. Wideband noise, present on VLF recordings as\nseen in Figures 1 and 3, is almost unchanged during STW\nperiods, dissimilar to the SFF values. Furthermore STWs\nappeared solely associated with whistlers suggesting that\nthe origin of STWs is neither in the satellite\u2019s surroundings\nnor in a satellite\u2013plasma medium interaction. (Note that cor-\nrelation with seismic activity at both geomagnetic conjugate\nareas has been checked, without positive result.)\n[16] Apparently branching, complex fast Fourier trans-\nform pattern of signals have been published since the late\n1960s. These phenomena have been classified into several\ncategories. Of those a few phenomena are comparable to\nSTWs, but the identified phenomena all have remarkable,\nfundamental differences to the STW signals as discussed\nbriefly below.\n4.1. Whistler\u2010triggered Emissions (Hooks)\n[17] One class of whistler\u2010triggered emissions has increas-\ning frequency versus time signal. However, these emissions\ntypically start above the respective whistler nose while the\nSFFs are far below the corresponding main trace nose.\nSTWs do not exhibit that periodic and strongly dispersive\nbehavior that these emissions (hooks) do [see Helliwell,\n1965, Figure 7\u20138 and Figure 7\u201348, p. 259; Nunn and Smith,\n1996; Rycroft, 1991]. However, Figure 5 shows that the\nmain trace exhibits no special feature, but the secondary\ntrace goes backward in time above the SFF, that is higher\nfrequencies appear before SFF in time. Thus the secondary\ntrace obviously cannot be triggered emission trace likewise\nthe whole phenomenon.\n4.2. Phenomena Similar to STW\n[18] There are two well known phenomena exhibiting\nsimilar time\u2010frequency pattern to STW at the first glance:\nthe walking trace (WT) and the magnetospherically reflected\n(MR) whistlers and the subclass of the latter one, the nu (n)\nwhistlers.

This phenomenon contains three parts, in which\nthe first one (appearing as rising tone) is the WT whistler\nitself. The three parts propagate on different paths indepen-\ndently from each other. In contrast this is not true for STWs,\nthey always form an \u201cY\u201d\u2010like pattern and the main and\nsecondary traces of an STW form one complete signal struc-\nture. They propagate together, exhibit common propagation\ncharacter, e.g., their dispersion increase together in the same\nmanner with increasing latitude.\n4.2.2. Magnetospherically Reflected (MR) Whistlers\n[20] Signals interpreted as magnetospherically reflected\n(MR) whistlers first observed onboard the OGO 1 satellite\n[Smith and Angerami, 1968] and more recently aboard\nMagion 4 and 5 [Shklyar and Ji\u00f8\u00ed\u00e8ek, 2000] may exhibit\nV\u2010shaped feature as crossing whistlers traces in a compound\necho train (e.g., see ray tracing simulation calculations from\nBortnik et al. [2003]). In the characteristic furcation pattern\nof STW one single main trace is always associated with one\nsingle secondary trace, dissimilar to reflected group of whis-\ntler signal trains.\n4.2.3. Nu (n) Whistlers\n[21] Nu (n) whistlers are a subclass of MR whistlers and\nthey are characterized by clear v\u2010shaped traces on spectro-\ngrams [Smith and Angerami, 1968; Shklyar et al., 2004].\nAccording to its interpretation based on detailed, strictly\nmonochromatic ray tracing modeling the complete signal\npattern forms the Greek letter v. \u201cThe energy at frequencies\nbelow the \u2018joining\u2019 frequency is not observed, presumably\nbecause it is reflected above the position of the satellite.\nEnergy at frequencies above the joining frequency is\nreflected below the point of the observation, and hence\ntwo traces are seen. Since the reflection is only possible at\nfrequencies below the lower hybrid resonance, it is con-\ncluded that the lower hybrid resonance (LHR) frequency\nat the satellite is somewhat greater than the frequency\nat which the two traces join\u201d [Smith and Angerami, 1968,\np. 7]. The part of the signal with frequencies lower than\nthe LHR frequency at the reflecting region is reflected\n[Kimura, 1966] and thus observed later. The minimum fre-\nquency of a nu whistler, at which the traces join, corresponds\nto the LHR frequency in the vicinity of the observing satellite.\nFrequencies above this point are reflected at a region with\nhigher LHR frequency. It is clear from the formation mecha-\nnism that the second trace of a nu whistler is the reflected\n\u201cpicture\u201d of the first one. Another consequence of the cited\ngeneration mechanism is that the propagation direction of\nthe two traces of a nu whistler is different, nearly opposite\nin space.\n[22] A comparison of the STWs and nu whistlers yields\nimportant differences.\n[23] 1. From the definition and model computations of\nnu whistlers follows that below the \u201cjoining frequency\u201d no\nFigure 4.

The 2 month period is from December 2004 to January 2005.\nFERENCZ ET AL.: UNUSUAL SIGNATURE IN DEMETER VLF DATA A02210A02210\n6 of 10\nsignal can be recorded, while the STWs always have a \u201cleg,\u201d\ni.e., the \u201cmain trace\u201d appears as a regular whistler\u2010like com-\nponent below the SFF. In connection with this statement one\ncan suppose that the STW is a composition of a regular\n\u201cducted\u201d whistler and of a nu whistler, formed by the above\nspecified mechanism in a nonducted propagation. Main and\nsecondary traces of STWs always exhibit a strict, common\nappearance and signal structure on spectra, without the sep-\naration of these signal parts (see e.g., Figures 7 or 1 and 3).\n[24] Additionally, their dispersion also changes alike. Fur-\nthermore, there is a certain, roughly 1 s long gap between\nthe nu whistler and the accompanied, but not necessarily ob-\nserved whistler, in accordance with their different propaga-\ntion paths between source and reflecting regions. In contrast,\nthere is no significant time delay between the main trace and\nthe increasing frequency secondary trace of an STW. Note\nthat there may be a short time lag (<30 ms) and a compound\nsignal fine structure around the SFF (see e.g., Figures 1a and\n7). The above arguments suggest that the parts of a complete\nSTW pattern propagate together; therefore, it cannot be\ninterpreted as a combination of a ducted and a nu whistler.\n[25] 2. By the investigation of the \u201ctraces\u201d of the STW\none can conclude that their accurate character, fine structure,\ncurvilinear shape on spectra significantly differ, showing\nthat the \u201csecondary trace\u201d is not simply a reflection of the\n\u201cmain trace,\u201d (see e.g., in Figure 1d or 1e). The secondary\ntrace of some STWs exhibits \u201cknots\u201d or bending that are\nnot observable on the main trace.\n[26] 3. Comparing the dispersion values of the \u201cmain\ntrace\u201d of the STWs and of the short path fractional hop\nwhistlers (see e.g., in Figure 1b and section 3) it is obvious\nthat the observed STWs had much longer propagation path,\ni.e., they were not upgoing directly from the lower atmo-\nspheric region below the satellite. Also, MR\u2010type reflection\ncannot occur in this region. The other possibility is the\nreflection caused by a density gradient can also be excluded,\nbecause this reflection produces a significantly different sig-\nnal pattern [see Ferencz, 2005, Figure 2].\n[27] The appearance and structure of STWs suggest that\nthey form a single, complex signal propagating in a unit at\nthe time of recordings opposite to the WT and Nu that parts\nof those propagate in different (opposite) directions. Unfor-\ntunately, the lack of enough measured wave components in\nVLF band on DEMETER prevents us to compute the wave\nnormals of main and secondary traces for WTs, nu\u2010s and\nSTWs. If our description is correct we should obtain differ-\nent wave normals for WT or n main and secondary traces,\nwhile the same for STW traces.\n[28] Consequently the formation of the observed STWs\ncannot be explained based on the current picture of either\ntriggered emissions, or the medium, or the formation\nmechanisms of WT whistlers, MR whistlers or nu whis-\ntlers, or by reflections caused by density gradients of the\nionosphere.\n4.3. Possible Early but Nonidentified STW Detections\non Board of Satellites\n[29] We can not exclude that on board of OGO 4 STWs\nwere recorded [see Walter and Angerami, 1969; Figure\n10b] and was identified by Walter and Angerami [1969]\nas WTs with \u201cirregular rising tones.\u201d However, to say any\nmore about this old record it would be necessary to make\nFigure 6.

Two double\u2010whistlers can be seen in Figure\n7 (around 1 and after 2 s, marked as MR\u2212 and MR+ com-\nponents), where both the first and second traces have\nSTW\u2010like patterns. Without a detailed investigation Smith\nand Angerami characterized this recording as \u201cunusual\nwhistlers,\u201d supposing that this pattern is a result of an MR\nprocess. Remarkable that Smith and Angerami [1968] did\nnot note the possibility that this observation could be ex-\nplained as nu whistler, excited by \u201cunusual\u201d primary signal.\nWe rather consider the exciting (primary) signals were\nSTWs in this case.\n[31] To assist the understanding of the possible changing\nof an STW pattern during a longer propagation in the mag-\nnetosphere we made model computations using the full\u2010\nwave ultra wideband (UWB) propagation model working\nperfectly in the ionospheric, magnetospheric investigations\n[Ferencz et al., 2001, 2007]. In this model computations\nwe did not take into account any reflection mechanism, only\nlongitudinal propagation and we used as excitation (source)\nsignal an STW signal recorded by the DEMETER (see\nFigure 1). Using this excitation the spectrogram of the com-\nputed signal after a single hop propagation through the mag-\nnetosphere is presented in Figure 8. This computed signal\nform has remarkable similarities with the signal patterns\nfrom Smith and Angerami [1968, Figure 7], and therefore,\nwe cannot exclude that the signals from Smith and Angerami\n[1968, Figure 7] mentioned above are STWs after a longer\npropagation through the magnetosphere.\n4.4. Possible Ground\u2010based STW Detection\n[32] Simultaneously to the DEMETER operation ground\u2010\nbased VLF recordings were conducted in France and in\nHungary as well. Signals, exhibiting the STW feature were\nnot observable on one\u2010hop whistlers recorded simultaneous\nwith the DEMETER recordings on the ground at these\nsites, selected by automatic whistler detection procedure\n[Lichtenberger et al., 2007, 2008], running on continuous\nground VLF data. However, archived high\u2010latitude VLF\nground data acquired at the British Antarctic Survey Halley\u2010\nStation, Antarctica (L = 4.5) in July 1995 yielded an exam-\nple of a whistler with a STW\u2010like pattern, illustrated in\nFigure 9. Beside the comparable general shape of the STWs\nand the illustrated ground recording on fast Fourier trans-\nform spectra it is convincing that the detailed signal pattern\nof the STWs around their SFF (e.g., Figure 7) and the fur-\ncating region exhibit remarkable similarity. The existence\nof a probable STW recorded on the ground is a contraindi-\ncation of any reflecting generation mechanism of this phe-\nnomenon and thus support the idea of a single, complex\nsignal with one or more copropagating modes. The enlarged\nspectrogram of the signals (Figure 10) recorded in Halley\nshows that this is a furcating signal and not two ones cross-\ning each other.\n[33] The above\u2010described STW effect of the VLF signals\npropagating in the plasmasphere has not identified and\nreported previously. The STW phenomenon recorded by\nthe DEMETER VLF wave experiment is a new type of sig-\nnal, though the formation mechanism of STWs is not yet\nknown. As it was presented above the major features of\nSTWs cannot be explained neither by WT nor by MR\n(nu) whistler formation mechanism nor by reflection from\nionospheric density gradients. If (one or more) ground\u2010\nbased STW\u2010type recording exists, than this fact excludes\nany mechanism responsible in WT and MR (nu) formation\nin the case of STWs.\n[34] Using the data of the DEMETER, the COMPASS\u20102\nand other satellites it is necessary to investigate the oc-\ncurrences of STWs in the future, in order to describe their\ndistribution in space (geographically) and in time (e.g., sea-\nsonal dependence). Analysis of the possible mechanisms\nforming the STW signal, as well as including nonlinear pro-\ncesses in the exact UWB solutions of the Maxwell\u2019s equa-\ntions is also needed. The relation of this phenomenon to\nthe state of the magnetoionic medium traversed by the\nVLF wave, such as the possible sources of these signals,\nFigure 9.

Conclusions\n[35] The following conclusions can be drawn from this\nstudy. (1) A new VLF signal type has been identified in\nthe wideband VLF recordings of the LEO DEMETER satel-\nlite termed as swallow\u2010tailed whistlers (STW). (2) STWs\nappear in series lasting several tens of seconds. (3) In a sev-\neral month long recording a dozen of strong and weaker\nSTW series were found. (4) The characteristic feature of\nthe STW is the branching into two traces: the main trace cor-\nresponds to a longer, probably oblique propagation path,\npossible fractional\u2010hop whistler, the joining secondary trace\nappears only above a certain frequency, termed Starting Fur-\ncation Frequency. In this study SFFs were found in the\nrange of 3.6\u201317.3 kHz. The secondary trace appears as sharp\nas the main trace and it is curvilinear, too. However, the fine\nstructure of the main and secondary trace differ. (5) Within\nthe observed STW series the SFF found monotonously to\ndecrease with a rate of several tens of Hz\/km along the cir-\ncular orbit, the furcation pattern may change with the\ndecreasing SFF, too. (6) If the dispersion of the main trace\nincreases, the dispersion of the secondary trace increases,\ntoo. (7) The comparison with other, previously published\nsignals having comparable fast Fourier transform features\nyielded that it is unlikely that STWs are generated in the\nnearby plasma environment of the satellite. (8) STWs were\nprobably found in ground\u2010based measurements and it is pos-\nsible that STWs were detected, however not identified in\nearlier satellite experiments, too. (9) From theoretical point\nof view it is of importance to find a specific sort of sig-\nnal\u2010medium interaction which results in an STW if applied\nin the analytical UWB solutions of the Maxwell\u2019s equations\n[Ferencz et al., 2001].\n[36] Acknowledgments.
