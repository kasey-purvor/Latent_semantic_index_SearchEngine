INTRODUCTION 23 \n 3\n The shelf edge or break was defined originally in terms of the increase in 1 \ngradient associated with it.  For example, Heezen et al. (1959) mentioned that \"The 2 \ncontinental shelf ... extends from the shore line to the shelf break where the seaward 3 \ngradient sharply increases to greater than 1:40.\"  Although the shelf edge may have 4 \nseemed abrupt with the vertical exaggeration typical of the older records from wide-5 \nbeam echo sounders, in detail the bathymetry steepens gradually between shelf and 6 \nslope (Bennett and Nelsen 1983; Field et al. 1983).  In the higher-resolution bathymetry 7 \nshown here, and in other datasets that we and others have studied (e.g., Adams and 8 \nSchlager 2000), the uppermost slope from where sea level lay at ~ 120 m during the 9 \nLGM down to a few hundred meters depth commonly has a convex form with gradually 10 \nvarying gradient.  Where continental slopes have prograded, they form giant sigmoidal 11 \nclinoforms, with this convex uppermost surface its \"rollover\" (Pirmez et al. 1998; 12 \nSangree and Widmier 1977). 13 \n Rollovers arise generally from a gradual variation in energy of the environment: 14 \nin shallow water, strong currents due to tides and waves flatten sediment topography, 15 \nwhereas in deeper water, where currents are weaker, sediment can form steeper 16 \ndeposits.  The analysis presented here is intended to contribute to developing a more 17 \nquantitative basis for this general statement, using information from theory and 18 \nexperiments to suggest how bedload sediment should be mobilized by currents.  Such 19 \nmodels potentially allow variations in seabed morphology to be linked with variations 20 \nof environment. 21 \n Although concerning mud rather than sand as here, previous modelling of 22 \nrollovers illustrate the trade-off between energy and gradient.  Friedrichs and Wright 23 \n(2004) showed how shelf mud, when kept suspended by waves, can form a seaward-24 \n 4\ntravelling gravity flow that deposits as wave agitation decreases where the flow extends 1 \nbeyond surface influences.  Their model deposits form rollovers typical of deltas found 2 \nat muddy river mouths.  In models for freshwater delta fronts (Bitzer and Harbaugh 3 \n1987; Pirmez et al. 1998), spreading and slowing of river outflow reduces bed shear 4 \nstress, causing fine suspended sediment to deposit, over time also creating rollovers. 5 \n Diffusion transport models in which the mobility K declines with depth can also 6 \nproduce rollovers (Flemings and Grotzinger 1997; Kaufman et al. 1991; Rivenaes 1992; 7 \nRivenaes 1997; Schlager and Adams 2001; Syvitski and Daughney 1992).  In our view, 8 \nthese models have not been well justified in marine settings because transport by many 9 \nof the processes claimed to be represented by the models is inconsistent with the 10 \nmodel's assumptions (Mitchell and Huthnance 2007).  However, we show here how the 11 \neffect of gravity on saltating sand could potentially lead to diffusion, suggesting a 12 \nrestricted application.  By deriving the diffusion equation from first principles, a 13 \nrelationship of the mobility K to the speed of currents is found, thus allowing 14 \nmeasurements of the modern currents to be compared via modelling with morphology, 15 \nlinking oceanographic environment to seabed evolution. 16 \n This paper is structured as follows.  We first examine the logic behind the 17 \ndiffusion model.  We then outline theory and experiments showing how the gravity 18 \neffect on saltating particles does potentially lead to diffusion of seabed topography.  A 19 \nsimple forward model illustrates how sandy rollovers could arise from the gravity 20 \neffect.  Using data from two sides of the Atlantic, we then describe and interpret 21 \nobservations of uppermost slope morphology that are consistent with the model, while 22 \nalso compiling data on modern bed currents to assess the extent to which currents 23 \nintensify towards the shelf edge and contribute to the rollover form.  The analysis then 24 \n 5\nexamines how stronger, more sharply varying bottom currents during earlier times of 1 \nlowered sea level provide a better explanation for how sand has deposited over a limited 2 \nextent of the uppermost slope, interpreting the rollover form as a relic of LGM 3 \nconditions. 4 \n 5 \nTHEORY 6 \nDiffusion Transport Models 7 \n In these models, a diffusion equation in surface topography H is used to 8 \nrepresent how down-slope sediment transport processes tend to fill in basins over time 9 \n(e.g., Driscoll and Karner 1999; Flemings and Grotzinger 1997; Granjeon and Joseph 10 \n1999; Jordan and Flemings 1991; Mitchell 1995; Mitchell 1996; Penn and Harbaugh 11 \n1999; Quiquerez et al. 2004; Wolfe et al. 1994).  The equation often used is 12 \n \u2202H\u2202t = K\u2207\n2H   (1), 13 \nwhere K is a mobility parameter (m2\/s).  The Laplacian \u22072H represents the terrain's 14 \ncurvature.  In these models, sediment accumulates in depressions because areas of 15 \npositive \u22072H imply positive \u2202H\/\u2202t in equation (1).  In the absence of other effects 16 \ngenerating relief (e.g., channelled erosion or tectonics), the model topography becomes 17 \nsmooth over time. 18 \n The model originates in hillslope studies by combining an argument for how 19 \nsoils creep down-slope with an assumption that mass is locally conserved (Culling 20 \n1960; Culling 1963; Kirkby 1971).  In linear creep (Small et al. 1999), soil moves at 21 \nrates simply proportional to the local topographic gradient: 22 \n Q  =  -K\u03c1s \u2202H\/\u2202y (2) 23 \nwhere Q (kg\/m\/s) is the mass flux in the down-slope direction (y (m)) per unit width of 24 \n 6\nslope and \u03c1s (kg\/m3) is the soil density.  The continuity relation represents how a spatial 1 \nchange in soil flux implies erosion or deposition (conservation of mass): 2 \n \u2202H\/\u2202t  =  -1\/\u03c1s \u2202Q\/\u2202y (3) 3 \nDifferentiating Equation 2 in y and substituting in Equation 3 then leads to a diffusion 4 \nequation in soil topography: 5 \n \u2202H\u2202t =\n\u2202\n\u2202y K\n\u2202H\n\u2202y\n\u239b \n\u239d \u239c \n\u239e \n\u23a0 \u239f  (4a) 6 \n or  \u2202H\/\u2202t  =  K\u22022H\/\u2202y2 (4b) 7 \nif K is constant or varies gradually so that \u2202K\/\u2202y\u00b7\u2202H\/\u2202y << K\u22022H\/\u2202y2.  Equation (1) can 8 \nbe derived by repeating this analysis in two dimensions. 9 \n If the model were to apply in marine settings, the sediment flux would need to 10 \noccur in the down-slope direction and to have a magnitude proportional to the bed 11 \ngradient (Equation 2).  As outlined elsewhere (Mitchell and Huthnance 2007), the 12 \neffects of many down-slope processes driven by gravity are unlikely to follow Equation 13 \n2 exactly, for example, slope failure and creep of clays involve threshold shear stresses 14 \nso their fluxes are not simply proportional to gradient.  Sedimentary flows possess 15 \nmomentum, so they are affected by upslope as well as local topography, and the 16 \nprocesses by which they deposit sediment are complex.  Fine-grained particles deposit 17 \nat rates that are not necessarily related to bed gradient, but rather to bed shear stress 18 \n(McCave and Swift 1976) and to factors stabilizing the surface against intermittently 19 \nhigh stress (McCave 1984), so muddy clinoforms are better modelled using other 20 \nschemes.  The diffusion model therefore does not describe marine sediment transport 21 \ngenerally, and its use should be limited to situations where its assumptions can be 22 \nshown to be followed. 23 \n 7\n 1 \nGravity Effect on Saltating Particles 2 \n In as much as there is presently no general review of the gravity effect available, 3 \nwe summarize the literature in electronic supplement ES1 and reproduce key points 4 \nhere.  Figure 1A shows a conceptual model for a fully developed bedload (Bagnold 5 \n1963), in which particles are mobile where the shear stress due to particle impacts with 6 \nthe bed exceeds a critical stress \u03c40.  The reaction to particle impacts effectively sets up a 7 \ndispersive pressure which keeps particles water-borne.  Ignoring initially the direct 8 \neffect of the current, the force of gravity acting on particles then leads to a net stress on 9 \nthe mobile layer parallel to the bed causing down-slope movement that is stabilized by 10 \nfriction.  According to this model, a greater thickness of particles (and greater flux) can 11 \nbe expected if the driving stress is larger because more particles will experience stresses 12 \nabove their critical value \u03c40. 13 \n Generalizing this conceptual model to two dimensions to include both the direct 14 \ncurrent and gravity effects, the total bedload flux Qb is: 15 \n Qb  =  S |u|2(u-\u03bb|u|\u2207H)\/g (5), 16 \nwhere S is a constant, \u03bb = 1\/tan\u03c6s, and \u2207H is bed gradient (bold symbols represent 17 \nvectors, |...| the vector magnitude and tan\u03c6s is the sediment friction coefficient)  (Bailard 18 \nand Inman 1981; Huthnance 1982a; Huthnance 1982b). 19 \n Of interest for morphological modelling, Equation 5 leads to sand flux simply 20 \nproportional to bed gradient (and hence topographic diffusion similar to Equation 1) in 21 \ntwo situations.  First, where the current continually reverses, such as under surface 22 \nwaves, internal tides or topographic waves, Equation 5 is dominated by the term \u03bb|u|\u2207H 23 \nif the vector average of u (i.e., the residual current) is small.  Second, the current u is 24 \n 8\ncommonly orthogonal to the gradient vector \u2207H (e.g., geostrophic residual currents 1 \nflowing parallel to contours).  Provided that the contour current is uniform along 2 \ncontours, the down-gradient component of Qb is then proportional to the bed gradient 3 \nand a diffusion equation can be constructed in the down-slope direction.  Both of these 4 \nsituations are common near the shelf edge. 5 \n Although Bagnold's original approach has been criticized, in particular for 6 \nweakly developed bedloads, these concepts help to visualize the origins of diffusion and 7 \nwhy sediment mobility relates to current strength.  The experimental results in Figure 2 8 \nreinforce this theory.  In Figure 2A, bedload data collected using a longitudinal flume 9 \n(Damgaard et al. 1997) show enhanced flux when flow was down-gradient and reduced 10 \nflux when up-gradient, with almost a linear variation with gradient on average.  The 11 \nchange in flux is relatively small for a small change in gradient (e.g., over 10\u02da) 12 \ncompared with the flux when the flume was horizontal, so the direct current effect (term 13 \nin u in Equation 5) can easily dominate over the gravity effect (term in \u03bb|u|\u2207H).  The 14 \nreason why the gravity effect can be effective in the oceans, leading to diffusion, 15 \nhowever, is that many currents oscillate so that the direct effect cancels out.  The results 16 \nshown in Figure 2B (Damgaard et al. 2003) are complicated by a stronger current 17 \nleading to suspension and bed rippling, but they nevertheless also show a gravity effect. 18 \n Sekine and Parker (1992) summarized models of bedload on slopes dipping 19 \ntransverse to the current (i.e., contour-following currents).  They suggested the 20 \nfollowing equation for the ratio of down-gradient flux qn to along-current flux qs: 21 \n qn\/qs = -B |\u2207H|;   B = B0(\u03c4c\/\u03c4b)m (6), 22 \nwhere B0 and \u03c4b are constants and \u03c4c is the current shear stress.  It also suggests a linear 23 \nincrease in the down-gradient flux with gradient |\u2207H| and that the flux increases with 24 \n 9\nthe current strength.  Sekine and Parker (1992) suggested that the main group of 1 \nexperimental data compiled in Figure 2C show that qn is similarly or somewhat less 2 \nrapidly varying with current stress than the qs.  Because the direct current flux qs 3 \nincreases with u3 or less (depending on importance of the threshold of motion) (Soulsby 4 \n1997), qn is also proportional to u3 or less.  Based on all the information available 5 \n(electronic supplement ES1), diffusion probably occurs with K proportional to between 6 \nroughly u2 and u3, implying a strong sensitivity to bottom current strength. 7 \n 8 \nForward Simulation 9 \n A numerical model was used to illustrate how rollovers could persist as steady 10 \nstate features of depth-declining currents, if sea level, wave climate, ocean currents, and 11 \nsupplied sediment flux and texture were all steady.  Only the gravity effect on bedload 12 \nwas accounted for.  Although simple compared with natural systems, the simulations are 13 \nintended to illustrate first-order controls, and the results are similar to those with 14 \nsinusoidally varying water level (Kaufman et al. 1991). 15 \n In the model (Figure 3), sand was supplied at a constant flux Q0 from the left 16 \nboundary and its evolving surface was represented by an equally spaced array of 17 \nelevation values, initially a simple ramp of gradient tan\u03b30.  The variation of mean 18 \ncurrent speed <|u|> with depth d was approximated by a power law: <|u|> \u221d d-\u03b2 (which 19 \nwill be shown later to approximate currents on the USA Atlantic slope).  The down-20 \ngradient flux of bedload was given by Qby \u221d -<|u|>n\u00b7\u2202H\/\u2202y, where \u2202H\/\u2202y is the offshore 21 \nbed gradient and n = 2.  Thus, Qby \u221d -d-2\u03b2\u2202H\/\u2202y was used to compute how the local flux 22 \nvaries with both current strength and bed gradient. 23 \n 10\n Bed gradients \u2202H\/\u2202y were derived from finite differences of the topography and 1 \nelevations adjusted iteratively using the continuity relation (\u2202H\/\u2202t = -\u2202Qby\/\u2202y\u00b71\/\u03c1s).  2 \nBecause this scheme leads to sediment becoming infinitely mobile at sea level, a 3 \nconstant value for d-2\u03b2 was imposed above a certain depth to maintain stability.  4 \n(Coordinates are omitted from Figure 3 because we wish to emphasize how changes in 5 \nparameters affect morphology but essentially the limiting depth for d-2\u03b2 lies along the 6 \ntops of the graphs.) 7 \n Figure 3A shows a simple developing clinoform, and the graph to its right shows 8 \nbed gradients calculated from the final topography.  In Figure 3B, the current speeds 9 \nwere varied more sharply with depth (double \u03b2), creating a markedly sharper rollover.  10 \nWith a doubling of Q0 (Figure 3C), the rollover was also sharper.  In Figure 3D, the 11 \nramp angle was doubled, producing a somewhat sharper rollover.  The convexity of a 12 \nsandy rollover therefore depends, not merely on the sharpness of the variation of 13 \ncurrents with depth but also on the sediment input and, to a lesser degree, on the shape 14 \nof the space in which the sediment accumulates. 15 \n The model rollover is only marginally below sea level, so the model does not 16 \npredict the existence of a shelf.  Clearly other processes generate shelves, such as 17 \nsubaerial erosion during sea-level lowstands.  If gravity-driven bedload transport plays 18 \nan important role, progradation of the uppermost slope occurs primarily during 19 \nconditions of lowered sea level (with sea level intersecting the upper face of the rollover 20 \nas in Figure 3) because extreme currents are needed in the shallow water to move the 21 \nsediment on small gradients.  Alternatively, if progradation is significant during high-22 \nstand conditions, other processes are needed to export sediment from the shelf. 23 \n 11\n These simulations represent sand only, but in practice mud depositing below the 1 \nrollover (Chin et al. 1988; Deibert et al. 2003; Dunbar and Barrett 2005) forms a 2 \nboundary condition to the gravity-driven transport of sand above.  Mud depositing 3 \nbelow the sand effectively elevates the clinoform face compared with its level if there 4 \nwere no mud available.  Its long-term effect is therefore similar to the sand prograding 5 \nover a shallower substrate, reducing convexity of the rollover. 6 \n Although the uncertainties in boundary conditions prevent subtle differences in 7 \nrollover shapes from being interpreted, the observed rollover shape may reflect a 8 \nparticular pattern of currents.  For example, the power-law depth-varying currents lead 9 \nto steepening gradient-depth graphs, whereas a simulation developed using 10 \nexponentially varying currents with depth (Figure 3E), such as might occur under waves 11 \nwith dominant height and period, has a flattening gradient-depth graph.  As shown later, 12 \nactual gradient trends are intermediate between these extremes. 13 \n 14 \n3.  MODERN CURRENTS 15 \n Near-bed measurements are compiled (Figure 4) to represent the average 16 \nvariation of bottom current speeds with depth (Figure 5).  Data sources are given in 17 \nelectronic supplement ES2, which discusses measurement issues.  The analysis mostly 18 \nconcerns USA Atlantic data collected over a year.  Measurements were made at various 19 \naltitudes but are left uncorrected because of insufficient information on bed roughness 20 \nand boundary-layer development.  The data in Figure 5 represent the effects of all 21 \ncurrent components including some oscillations under surface waves but primarily 22 \nlonger period oscillations, because surface waves have minor effect at depths of the 23 \ncontinental slope and the meters tend to average out short period oscillations.  The data 24 \n 12\nrepresent the average of the current speed, i.e., the scalar not the vector of current 1 \nvelocity. 2 \n 3 \n3.1. USA Atlantic 4 \n Currents intensify up the USA slope towards the shelf edge, where they 5 \nresuspend silt (Churchill et al. 1994).  The dotted line in Figure 5A represents the 6 \naverage power-law trend of the near-bed data (solid symbols) below 150 m.  The 7 \nrecords for these sites show the different oceanographic influences, varying from long-8 \nperiod topographic Rossby waves (Gulf Stream eddy rings with 5 to 29 day periods) to 9 \nhigh-frequency surface (wind) waves, with residual currents primarily along-slope 10 \n(Aikman et al. 1988; Beardsley et al. 1985; Butman 1988; Butman et al. 1979; Csanady 11 \net al. 1988; Fratantoni et al. 2001; McClennen 1973; McGregor 1979; Shaw et al. 1994).  12 \nSeparating the data by frequency, Csanady et al. (1988) showed how the influence of 13 \nthe different oscillations varies: Rossy-wave currents affect the whole slope, whereas 14 \nwind-driven upwelling or downwelling currents, tidal currents, and currents under 15 \nsurface waves are important over the upper slope but decline to 1000 m.  Internal tides 16 \nare enhanced near the shelf edge where a front between the shelf and slope water bodies 17 \nintersects the seabed (Aikman et al. 1988; Flagg 1988; Ou and Maas 1988).  Cacchione 18 \net al. (2002) showed how bed stresses from internal waves intensify where the bed 19 \ngradient approaches the characteristic gradient of the waves, modulating how fine 20 \nsediment deposits on the slope. 21 \n Somewhat different currents might be expected between sites, but comparisons 22 \nbetween current meters suggests that, away from major canyons, the regression in 23 \nFigure 5A approximates the typical uppermost slope enhancement.  Figure 6 compares 24 \n 13\nthe current variances computed by Csanady et al. (1988) for different frequency bands 1 \n(see figure caption).  The sites near 1000 m depth show a similar influence of Rossby 2 \nwaves.  Higher-frequency currents in shelf-edge sites A and SF in Figure 4 are also 3 \ncomparable. 4 \n 5 \nIberia Atlantic 6 \n The fewer measurements made off Iberia are compiled in Figure 5B (electronic 7 \nsupplement ES2).  The solid lines in Figure 5B show currents derived from 10 days of 8 \nship acoustic Doppler measurements (electronic supplement ES3; bold line is median 9 \naverage, and fine lines represent the inter-quartile range of current speed).  The power-10 \nlaw trend (dotted line) was derived from all bottom-measured data below 150 m depth, 11 \nincluding measurements from 100 m altitude above bottom to compensate for data 12 \nscarcity.  It suggests a more sharply varying speed with depth than off the USA.  13 \nAlthough this difference is unresolved statistically, a sharp variation might be expected 14 \nbecause of this area's exposure to Atlantic swell (Vitorino et al. 2002) and strong 15 \ninternal waves on the shelf (Jeans and Sherwin 2001; Sherwin et al. 2002; Vitorino et al. 16 \n2002). 17 \n Different wind directions in winter and summer lead to sustained downwelling 18 \nand upwelling, respectively (Vitorino et al. 2002).  On such easterly ocean margins, an 19 \nequatorward wind stress induces an Ekman spiral (a Coriolis effect on the currents) and 20 \ntransport of surface water offshore relative to the water below.  Upwelling of underlying 21 \nwater replaces surface water blown offshore.  The sea surface is lowered at the coast, 22 \nleading to an equatorward geostrophic current developing to balance the surface 23 \ngradient, a current that is enhanced by the equatorward wind stress.  Downwelling 24 \n 14\noccurs during the opposite conditions.  Numerical models show that upwelling and 1 \ndownwelling lead to bed currents declining seawards from the shelf edge (Davies et al. 2 \n2002; Xing and Davies 2002), contributing to the trends observed in Figure 5B. 3 \n 4 \nGEOLOGY AND MORPHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS 5 \nUSA Atlantic Margin 6 \n Figure 7A shows bathymetry derived with continuous coverage of multibeam 7 \necho sounders.  Above where the slope is incised by canyons, the topography is 8 \nremarkably smooth and ridges between canyons are rounded rather than sharp.  Figure 9 \n7B shows the median gradient (50%) and inter-quartile range of gradients (25% to 75%) 10 \nfor the area outlined in Figure 7A (where gradients were derived from differences in 11 \nelevation in offshore and along-slope directions over a 50 m lengthscale after smoothing 12 \nthe bathymetry grid with a 250 m by 250 m filter (Wessel and Smith 1991)).  Median 13 \ngradient increases almost linearly with depth to 500 m, a variation implying that the 14 \nmorphology is exponential-like in profile, which is illustrated by the dashed exponential 15 \ncurves fitted by least-squares to the profiles shown in Figure 7C. 16 \n Figure 7B shows median grain sizes derived from grab sampling at sites located 17 \nby solid star symbols in Figure 7A.  Coinciding with the smooth morphology, the 18 \nseabed is sandy at the surface, with a transition to mud at 300 m to 350 m.  Published 19 \nmaps show this pattern of grading continuing along-strike (e.g., Keller et al. 1979; 20 \nSouthard and Stanley 1976; Stanley et al. 1983; Stanley and Wear 1978).  Subsurface 21 \nlithologies sampled at AMCOR 6007 drilled on the outer shelf (Figure 7A) include 22 \nmostly sand of Pleistocene to Miocene age (Figure 7F) (Hathaway et al. 1979; 23 \nHathaway et al. 1976).  From an ALVIN dive 50 km NE of Figure 7A, Malahoff et al. 24 \n 15\n(1982) noted an upwards change to coarser sand with pebbles, cobbles, and even some 1 \nboulders above 380 m depth. 2 \n Two seismic reflection lines show a stratigraphic pattern typical of seaward 3 \nprogradation along with aggradation on the outer shelf.  The multichannel data in Figure 4 \n7D, collected along the dashed line in Figure 7A (Schlee et al. 1976), show shallow-5 \ndipping foresets subparallel to the modern seabed.  The single-channel data in Figure 7E 6 \nalso shows subparallel foresets but that the shelf edge stratigraphy overlies strata 7 \ndeeping shallowly seawards.  Nevertheless, it confirms a lateral extension of the 8 \nstratigraphy beneath the uppermost slope in Figure 7D, a pattern that is also mimicked 9 \nin other seismic data collected nearby (McGregor et al. 1979; Schlee et al. 1979). 10 \n 11 \nIberian Atlantic Margin 12 \n Figure 8A shows bathymetry also collected with a multibeam echo sounder 13 \n(NERC 2001).  The morphology shallower than 500 m is smooth, similar to Figure 7A.  14 \nProfiles \"a\" and \"b\" in Figure 8B also show a rounded shape.  Median gradient (Figure 15 \n8C) of data from the area outlined in Figure 8A reveals a quasi-linear steepening with 16 \ndepth to 700 m, but with the rate of steepening only half that in Figure 7C.  17 \nMultichannel seismic reflection data collected along the \"Ewing\" track shown in Figure 18 \n8A (P\u00e9rez Gussiny\u00e9 2000, her Figure 2.2) show reflectors beneath the outer shelf 19 \nsubparallel to the seabed to around 1 km sediment depth.  Bottom photographs collected 20 \nnear 200 m depth (located by open circles in Figure 8A) show a bioturbated muddy sand 21 \n(NERC 2001).  Samples recovered near there and immediately shallower are fine-22 \ngrained sands with < 25% silt and clay (mean grain size 2-3 \u03c6) (Dias et al. 2002; 23 \nJouanneau et al. 2002; van Weering et al. 2002). 24 \n 16\n 1 \nInterpretation of Morphology 2 \n Many of the topographic characteristics observed are typical of diffusion 3 \n(Mitchell and Huthnance 2007).  For example, the smoothness of the terrain is expected 4 \nbecause, from Equation 1, bumps (negative \u22072H) and depressions (positive \u22072H) 5 \nprogressively attenuate (locations of negative and positive \u2202H\/\u2202t, respectively) if not 6 \nmaintained by other effects.  Furthermore, parabolic surfaces between canyon heads are 7 \nalso typical (though not necessarily diagnostic) of diffusion because the parabola is the 8 \nsteady state solution to the diffusion equation when material is removed constantly at 9 \nthe channels.  Where the bed is sandy, we ascribe these observations to the gravity 10 \neffect on saltating sand and true diffusion (Mitchell and Huthnance 2007). 11 \n The seismic data show that the morphology has prograded, so sand has been 12 \nexported from the shelf persistently and spilled over the shelf edge.  Spilled sand was 13 \nmobilized by currents affecting the uppermost slope, leading to a gravity-driven 14 \nmovement of particles and a stratigraphic evolution similar to that illustrated in Figure 15 \n3. 16 \n In later analysis, we further assume that areas below present 150 m depth lay 17 \npersistently below sea level during the LGM, based on work elsewhere (Yokoyama et 18 \nal. 2000).  A lack of significant glacio-isostasy in the area of Figure 7A is suggested by 19 \ndepths of submerged shorelines (Dillon and Oldale 1977), and a depth of 150 m keeps 20 \nour analysis away from possible beach shoreface effects of the LGM. 21 \n 22 \nDERIVING A MODEL K FROM MORPHOLOGY 23 \n 17\n We develop a kinematic model to invert the morphology for diffusion mobility 1 \nK, which then allows us to compare the variation in the derived K with the currents, 2 \nassuming that sediment mobility simply originates from the gravity effect on saltating 3 \nparticles.  The results are not unique, so the exercise is intended rather to identify the 4 \nrange of values consistent with the model.  An assumption of long-term steady state is 5 \nrequired.  In as much as seismic reflectors parallel the modern seafloor in these areas, 6 \nthe morphology is probably steady state over 100 ky to My timescales, depending on 7 \ndata resolution, but not necessarily so over shorter timescales. 8 \n Much of the following analysis is possible analytically because the uppermost 9 \nslope is nearly exponential: 10 \n d'  =  d0'exp(sy) (7), 11 \nwhere d' = d-dr is depth below a reference depth dr such that gradient \u2202H\/\u2202y = -sd' (i.e., 12 \nlinear with depth, Figure 2a), s is the rate of bed steepening with depth (herein called the 13 \nconvexity parameter) and y is distance offshore from where d' = 0.  Parameters dr = 111 14 \nand 136 m and s = 0.000679 and 0.000328 were obtained by least-squares regression of 15 \nmedian gradient on depth from Figures 7B and 8B, respectively. 16 \n 17 \nDeriving Ky Assuming that Sand Bypasses 18 \n If all sand exported from the shelf bypasses and none deposits, the offshore 19 \ncomponent of flux, Qb,y, is then spatially uniform and Ky can be obtained simply by 20 \ninverting Equation 1 (i.e., K \u221d 1\/(|\u2207H|)).  This is unrealistic, because sand has deposited 21 \nover a restricted area beyond the outer shelf, but nevertheless the predicted variation in 22 \nKy shown in the first two graphs for Ky in Figure 9A (continuous lines \"uniform Q\") 23 \nprovides a limiting trend.  (Here and in other graphs in Figure 9, values of Ky are shown 24 \n 18\nas both Ky1\/3 and Ky1\/2 to compare with the mean current speeds, assuming bedload 1 \nmodels in which Qby \u221d <|u|>3|\u2207H| and Qby \u221d <|u|>2|\u2207H|, respectively.  Values were also 2 \nnormalized by dividing by the value for Ky at d' = 100 m.) 3 \n 4 \nDeriving Ky for Prograding Geometries 5 \n Figure 10 shows the geometry used to calculate Ky more generally.  This is done 6 \nessentially by working out how average deposition rates have varied spatially and then 7 \nderiving transport flux using the continuity relation.  K is subsequently obtained from 8 \nthe flux and bed gradient (Equation 2). 9 \n If the uppermost slope aggrades uniformly, \u2202H\/\u2202t = A is uniform (Figure 10A).  10 \nIf instead the uppermost slope progrades (Figure 10B), deposition rates increase away 11 \nfrom the outer shelf.  Their values required to advance the morphology uniformly at rate 12 \n\u2202y\/\u2202t (i.e., to maintain a steady state shape) are given by 13 \n \u2202H\/\u2202t  =  -\u2202d'\/\u2202y.\u2202y\/\u2202t  (8) 14 \nIf the rollover both aggrades and progrades (Figure 10C), A is added: 15 \n \u2202H\/\u2202t  =  A-\u2202d'\/\u2202y.\u2202y\/\u2202t  (9a), 16 \nor \u2202H\/\u2202t  =  A+sd'.\u2202y\/\u2202t  (9b) 17 \nby replacing \u2202d'\/\u2202y with -sd'.  We define a parameter tan\u03b1 = A\/(\u2202y\/\u2202t) representing the 18 \nratio of upwards to seawards growth of the rollover.  Physically, \u03b1 is the rollover's 19 \nclimbing angle, which in principle can be measured from seismic reflection data (Figure 20 \n10C).  Replacing \u2202y\/\u2202t with A\/tan\u03b1 then leads to 21 \n \u2202H\u2202t = A 1+\nd's\ntan\u03b1\n\u239b \n\u239d \u239c \n\u239e \n\u23a0 \u239f   (10) 22 \n 19\nin which deposition rates increase linearly with depth change d'.  (At larger scale, 1 \ndeposition rates decline down the continental slope (e.g., Sanford et al. 1990), but this is 2 \nbeyond the sandy area of interest.) 3 \n Equation 10 also shows that the convexity parameter s reflects how time-4 \naveraged deposition rates have varied.  If the rollover is sharply convex (large s), 5 \nsharply varying deposition rates are required to maintain the morphology. 6 \n Spatial variations in the time-averaged flux Qy are derived by applying the 7 \ncontinuity relation in y.  Replacing \u2202H\/\u2202t of Equation 10 with -1\/\u03c1s\u2202Qy\/\u2202y from 8 \nEquation 3 and integrating in y produces 9 \n Qy (y) = Qy0 \u2212 A\u03c1s y +\nd0 '\ntan\u03b1\nesy \u22121( )\u239b \u239d \u239c \n\u239e \n\u23a0 \u239f  (11) 10 \nwhere Qy0 is the offshore component of flux on the outer shelf (at y = y0 corresponding 11 \nto where d' = d0').  Replacing y using Equation 7 leads to 12 \n Qy (d') = Qy0 \u2212 A\u03c1s\nln(d' \/d0 ')\ns\n+\nd'\u2212d0 '( )\ntan\u03b1\n\u239b \n\u239d \u239c \n\u239e \n\u23a0 \u239f  (12). 13 \n If all flux Qy occurs as gravity-driven bedload, Ky can be obtained from Equation 14 \n12.  Because finer-grained material around the mudline is transported in suspension, 15 \nobeying different transport rules, Equation 12 under-represents the sharpness of the true 16 \ndecline in sand Qy with d'.  Our interpretation therefore focuses on the upper part of the 17 \nrollover. 18 \n Ky is derived from Equation 2, \u2202H\/\u2202y = -sd' and Equation 12 for Qy: 19 \n Ky (d') =\nA\u03c1s\nsd'\nQy0\nA\u03c1s\n\u2212\nln(d' \/d0 ')\ns\n\u2212\nd'\u2212d0 '\ntan\u03b1\n\u239b \n\u239d \u239c \n\u239e \n\u23a0 \u239f  (13) 20 \nThe form of Ky(d') thus depends on Qy0, A, \u03c1s, s, d0', and \u03b1, of which s can be derived 21 \nfrom bathymetry and \u03b1 can in principle be estimated from seismic data.  Although A, 22 \n 20\nQy0, and \u03c1s could each be estimated separately if adequate stratigraphic and physical 1 \nproperty data were available, we instead use their ratio Qy0\/A\u03c1s which is a lengthscale 2 \nover which sediment of flux Qy0 would deposit at average rate A.  d0' was set to 1 m. 3 \n 4 \nComparing Inversion Results to Modern Current Data and LGM Conditions 5 \n Figures 9A and 9B show inversion results along with (dotted lines in graphs) the 6 \nmean current speed variation from Figure 5A.  Although the latter is only the mean, 7 \npeak speeds (more relevant to mobilizing bedload) probably have a similar power-law 8 \ntrend, as suggested by the curves of Doppler data in Figure 5B in which the upper 9 \nquartile parallels the median average.  Threshold-of-motion effects should be 10 \nconsidered in refinements of this model.  From Figures 7D and 7E, the rollover 11 \nclimbing angle \u03b1 is 11\u02da to 16\u02da (inversion results with \u03b1 = 10\u02da are most relevant, though 12 \nothers are shown to illustrate effect of uncertainty in \u03b1). 13 \n Figure 9B shows a relatively moderate decline in K with depth if the lengthscale 14 \nQy0\/A\u03c1s is large compared with the uppermost slope region of interest.  The trend is 15 \nsomewhat steeper than the modern current data, although the difference may be less 16 \nsignificant if thresholds of motion effects are considered (i.e., if the amount by which 17 \nspeed exceeds threshold decreases more greatly from 100 m to 300 m than the mean 18 \nspeed).  There is little evidence that sand deposits over this lengthscale, however, based 19 \non the distance across the rollover to the sand\/mud transition (Figure 7).  More 20 \nrealistically, sand has deposited over a short distance of a few kilometers beyond the 21 \nouter-shelf parts of the profiles in Figure 7C, so Ky must vary sharply with depth, as in 22 \nFigure 9A, where trends are steeper than the current speed data. 23 \n 21\n Because much of the outer shelf sediment was deposited during the LGM 1 \n(Southard and Stanley 1976), the uppermost slope morphology could reflect the stronger 2 \ncurrents at that time.  Although difficult to quantify, conditions during the LGM should 3 \nhave led to more sharply varying currents with depth than at present, consistent with the 4 \nmore steeply varying Ky.  Bottom currents due to surface waves will have been more 5 \nstrongly felt with depressed sea level.  Surface waves mobilizing sand to 200 m depth 6 \n(Komar et al. 1972) could have affected the bed below present-day 300 m during the 7 \nLGM.  Figure 9C shows variations in peak bottom current speed us produced by 20 s 8 \nand 10 s period storm waves with sea level depressed by 120 m (calculated with a deep-9 \nwater approximation), which more closely match the inversion data in Figure 9A with \u03b1 10 \n= 10\u02da.  Storms may also have been more frequent and vigorous based on enhanced NaCl 11 \nand dust in ice cores (Mayewski et al. 1994). 12 \n It is difficult to say if other oceanographic currents would have had the same 13 \nrelation to the uppermost slope as in the modern data (Figure 5) because little is known 14 \nabout atmospheric forcing and ocean density stratification.  Salinities of sediment pore 15 \nwaters suggest that the LGM oceans had a different density structure (Adkins et al. 16 \n2002), which could have affected internal-wave dynamics.  An LGM tidal model 17 \n(Egbert et al. 2004) suggests that M2 tidal amplitudes were greater off the USA Atlantic 18 \ncoast by a factor of two, and may have been larger if the oceans were less density 19 \nstratified than at present, e.g., because of lower surface temperature.  Tidal flows at the 20 \nshelf edge would have been further intensified because they supplied the high to low 21 \nwater volume via shallower depth over the outer shelf when sea level was lowered.  22 \nThus, although difficult to test formally, currents are expected to have been more 23 \n 22\nsharply varying with depth during the LGM, as we also suspect from the inversions of 1 \nmorphology and short deposition distance of the sand. 2 \n 3 \nEffects of an Offshore Residual Current 4 \n If the residual (vectorally averaged) current has a finite component 5 \nperpendicular to the shelf edge and it declines down the slope, an additional 6 \nconvergence of its associated sediment flux also contributes to prograding the 7 \nuppermost slope (e.g., Quiquerez et al. 2004).  Figure 11A shows such a decline in the 8 \nmean offshore component of current-meter measurements from the two margins 9 \n(Csanady et al. 1988; Huthnance et al. 2002). 10 \n A rough comparison with the gravity-driven offshore flux can be made using 11 \nEquation 5.  It suggests that the offshore current component dominates if <uy>\/<|u|> > 12 \n|\u2207H|\/tan\u03c6s.  The dashed and dotted lines in Figure 11B show |\u2207H|\/tan\u03c6s computed from 13 \nthe median gradients in Figures 7 and 8, respectively, and with tan\u03c6s = 0.63 (Soulsby 14 \n1997).  A change from current-driven to gravity-driven transport with depth is 15 \nsuggested by the USA data values greater than |\u2207H|\/tan\u03c6s at ~ 200 m but less than 16 \n|\u2207H|\/tan\u03c6s at 500 m.  The Iberian values are both greater than |\u2207H|\/tan\u03c6s, however, 17 \nsuggesting that sand bedload transport is driven mainly by downwelling at present. 18 \n 19 \nDiffusion in 2D 20 \n A diffusion equation with K declining with depth was applied to the bathymetry 21 \nto explore tendencies of erosion or accumulation that would result if it were to apply 22 \nuniversally above 300 to 350 m where sand exists.  The calculation ignores how local 23 \n 23\ntopography affects the currents, so only a general tendency implied by the variation of K 1 \nwith depth is sought, not one that applies exactly to all locations. 2 \n The bathymetry data (Figure 7A) were re-projected and smoothed with a 250 m 3 \nfilter.  Local sand flux was calculated from Q  =  -K\u2207\u0397, where gradient \u2207\u0397 (Figure 4 \n12A) was derived from finite differences of the bathymetry.  The mobility was 5 \ndecreased inversely with depth d: K = K0(d\/d0)-1 where d0 = 1 m is a reference depth.  6 \n(K\u221dd-1 is nearly equivalent to using the trend in Figure 5A (\u03b2 = 0.36) with n = 3.)  7 \nChanges in topography were then calculated from continuity, \u2202H\/\u2202t = -\u2207.Q.  The 8 \ncalculation was repeated iteratively, each time adjusting the bathymetry and re-9 \ncalculating bed gradients to quantify Q.  The resulting depth change values are omitted 10 \nfrom Figure 12B to highlight the pattern of relative change rather than absolute values, 11 \nand results below 400 m are censored because the model is not relevant to the muddy 12 \nslope sediments. 13 \n If Equation 1 were to apply uniformly with constant K, the spurs between 14 \ncanyon heads (areas of negative curvature) would erode (negative \u2202H\/\u2202t) relative to the 15 \noutermost shelf, where straight contours indicate smaller curvature.  Figure 12B instead 16 \nshows little bed change across the uppermost slope away from canyon heads because K 17 \ndecreasing sharply with depth compensates for increasing terrain curvature.  Where the 18 \nuppermost slope is sandy, therefore, the persistence of morphologic features of differing 19 \ncurvature may imply persistence in bottom current patterns too. 20 \n 21 \nDISCUSSION 22 \n Previous studies reproducing clinoform rollovers with diffusion models (e.g., 23 \nFlemings and Grotzinger 1997; Kaufman et al. 1991; Rivenaes 1997; Schlager and 24 \n 24\nAdams 2001) have, in our view, not adequately justified using the diffusion equation.  1 \nFrom the justification using the gravity effect on saltating particles identified here, the 2 \nbed shear stress or bottom current speed strongly control sediment mobility.  It is 3 \nprobably not adequate to simulate the effects of sea-level fluctuations on transport by 4 \nchanging water depth alone (Flemings and Grotzinger 1997; Kaufman et al. 1991; 5 \nRivenaes 1997; Schlager and Adams 2001), because changing water depth also varies 6 \nthe tidal currents and because greater frequency of storms during the LGM implies a 7 \ndifferent influence of surface waves.  The rounding of the shelf edge suggested as due to 8 \nvarying sea level or wave base level  (Adams and Schlager 2000; Schlager and Adams 9 \n2001)  is suggested here instead to reflect the way in which bed shear stress varies with 10 \ndepth, a more gradually curved rollover arising from gradually varying shear stress with 11 \ndepth.  Furthermore, sharp rollovers have been produced with models in which K is 12 \nconstant in the water column and interpreted as representing a lack of near-surface 13 \ninfluences (Schlager and Adams 2001).  In such models, however, an abruptly increased 14 \nK above the water line is often used to simulate high mobility of sediment where 15 \nexposed subaerially, so such models should prompt us to consider whether sharp 16 \nrollovers in data imply abruptly varying K, not necessarily a lack of near-surface 17 \ninfluences. 18 \n The sensitivity of K to current speeds has implications for interpreting relative 19 \nsea-level change from margin sequences (Vail et al. 1977).  Flemings and Grotzinger 20 \n(1997) illustrated how fluctuations in sediment supply can generate sequences of 21 \ncharacter similar to those generated by sea-level fluctuations (Christie-Blick and 22 \nDriscoll 1995).  If the enhanced salt concentrations in ice cores (Mayewski et al. 1994) 23 \nimplies an enhanced storm frequency and\/or severity, the mean bed current speed in 24 \n 25\nwave-dominated environments should be enhanced, implying an increase in mobility K.  1 \nFor example, a doubling of storm frequency would imply doubling of <|u|>, increasing 2 \nK by a factor 4 to 8 (from K \u221d <|u|2> to K \u221d <|u|3>).  Combined with varying residual 3 \ncurrents, variations in \"oceanic climate\" can potentially affect unconformities and 4 \nobscure simple effects of sea-level fluctuation on sequences, which are often guided by 5 \ngeometry of strata around the rollover (Steckler et al. 1999). 6 \n Although the single-component model developed here usefully provides 7 \ninsights, it lacks many effects which need further investigation before incorporating 8 \nthem into more complete models (e.g., Quiquerez et al. 2004).  To include bedload 9 \ntransport by residual currents, we would need to predict upwelling or downwelling 10 \ncurrents of earlier periods when less information on wind conditions are available.  How 11 \nmud components within the rollover and below it contribute to rollover convexity are 12 \ndifficult to address because of difficulty in predicting biological and physical 13 \nstabilisation under time-varying currents (McCave 1984; Sanford and Maa 2001). 14 \n The activity of fish and other organisms can also affect seabed morphology over 15 \ngeological periods, and the gravity effect on biologically resuspended particles 16 \npotentially contributes to topographic diffusion (Mitchell and Huthnance 2007).  17 \nBecause lateral sediment fluxes from by biological activity have not been quantified, its 18 \nmorphological effect is difficult to assess quantitatively, but bio-mixing rates of 19 \nradiometric tracers in cores typically decline below the shelf edge mimicking the 20 \ndecline in current speeds (Anderson et al. 1988; Henderson et al. 1999; Middelburg et 21 \nal. 1997; Schmidt et al. 2002; Soetaert et al. 1996). 22 \n Examining the geometry of older strata can potentially inform this problem 23 \nbecause transport consistent with a diffusion-type model implies that strata should 24 \n 26\nsteepen if sediment flux increases (Schlager and Adams 2001).  This can be seen from 1 \nEquation 2: \u2202H\/\u2202y increases if K and \u03c1 are constant but Q increases.  Alternatively, if Q 2 \nwere constant but there were a change in oceanographic conditions, then K could vary 3 \nand also affect the steepness of strata. 4 \n In some seismic datasets, the ancient rollover is more rounded than the modern 5 \nrollover, possibly reflecting effects of K and Q.  This can be seen, for example, in data 6 \ncollected across the shelf edge in the South Western Approaches to the UK and France, 7 \nwhere Pleistocene sediments have a markedly sharper rollover than their underlying 8 \nupper Miocene (Bourillet et al. 2003), which largely comprises sand (Evans and Hughes 9 \n1984; Pantin and Evans 1984).  The modern surface is consistent with diffusion 10 \n(Mitchell and Huthnance 2007), being smooth aside from bedform relief (Cunningham 11 \net al. 2005). 12 \n A similar sharpening, from Late Oligocene towards Pleistocene, can be seen in 13 \nthe New Jersey shelf edge of Steckler et al. (1999).  Their reconstructions suggest that 14 \nthe uppermost slope was more gradually curved (e.g., s' = 2 X 10-4 m-1 for their m6 15 \nsurface) than we find for the area in Figure 7 (s' = 6.74 X 10-4 m-1).  Evidence that 16 \nbedload transport and hence the gravity effect was involved in creating these rollovers 17 \nincludes rounding of grains sampled in the Miocene strata (Poppe et al. 1990). 18 \n These two examples could potentially reflect changes in oceanographic 19 \nconditions.  The Miocene and earlier periods were times of more stable sea level with 20 \nvariations of < 50 m (John et al. 2004; Kominz et al. 1998; Kominz and Pekar 2001; 21 \nMiller et al. 1998; Van Sickel et al. 2004) and extreme low-stands rarely reaching 100 22 \nm based on foraminiferal \u03b418O (John et al. 2004; Lear et al. 2004).  The enhanced tidal 23 \ncurrents and oscillating currents due to storm-induced waves for the LGM shelf edge 24 \n 27\nshould therefore have been less frequent during these previous periods compared with 1 \nthe Pleistocene.  Thus, before the Pleistocene, more stable conditions imply long 2 \nperiods with a more gradually varying mobility with depth, in turn leading to a more 3 \ngradually curved uppermost slope. 4 \n Sediment fluxes to the margins also generally increased into the Pleistocene 5 \nassociated with enhanced continental erosion of the glacial world, potentially leading to 6 \nsharpened rollovers of sand.  Enhanced fluxes are suggested, for example, by deposition 7 \nrates in marginal basins dramatically increasing globally during the last 2 to 4 Ma 8 \n[Zhang, 2001 #2454].  Furthermore, in Steckler et al.'s (1999) reconstructions, the shelf 9 \nedge is sharper in the Middle Miocene than in the Late Oligocene, tracking an increased 10 \nrate of sediment supply implied by the margin progradation rate. 11 \n 12 \nCONCLUSIONS 13 \n The morphology of the uppermost slope is consistent with having been modified 14 \nas though by a diffusion equation with mobility K declining with depth, generating the 15 \nrollover and smooth, parabolic regions between canyon heads.  Given the presence of 16 \nsand and how modern currents decline with depth, the gravity effect on saltating 17 \nparticles provides a plausible explanation for this apparent diffusion.  The sand has 18 \ndeposited relatively close to the outermost shelf, which implies that mobility declines 19 \nsharply with depth.  This could be consistent with stronger currents that declined more 20 \nrapidly with depth during the Last Glacial Maximum.  The models imply that both the 21 \nsharpness of the uppermost slope rollover in profile and morphology in plan view 22 \ndepend on how the currents vary spatially, as well as on sediment flux to the slope and 23 \naccommodation space. 24 \n 28\n 1 \nAcknowledgments  This work is based on multibeam sonar and geological data made 2 \nfreely available by the NOAA.

The long-16 \ndash line separates the bedload from the immobile bed below, defined as the level at 17 \nwhich shear stresses equal the threshold of motion.  B) Down-gradient movement arises 18 \nbecause the momentum transfer from grain to grain collisions keeping the bedload 19 \nmobile acts perpendicular to the bed on average (\"dispersive pressure\"), whereas the 20 \nbedload weight acts vertically, leading to a net pressure acting parallel to the bed (gray 21 \nvector) which becomes balanced by friction.

GRAVITY EFFECT ON SANDY BEDLOAD 2 \n The following section outlines present understanding of how gravity affects 3 \nbedload transport flux.  The initial models based on Bagnold's (1963) work are 4 \ndescribed first, because they provide a useful framework for understanding the influence 5 \non bed morphology.  Bagnold's approach is considered valid only for highly developed, 6 \ndense bedloads (Leeder 1979), so more recent work describing effects of individual 7 \nsaltating particles is also described. 8 \n For a simple horizontal sandy bed affected by a strong uniform, steady current, 9 \nBagnold's original formula is still considered reasonably accurate (Soulsby 1997): 10 \n Qb (kg\/m\/s) \u221d \u03c4b1\/2(\u03c4b-\u03c40); \u03c4b>\u03c40 (ES1) 11 \nwhere \u03c4b is the shear stress imposed by bottom current on the bed and \u03c40 is a threshold 12 \nstress for sediment motion (the symbol \"\u221d\" means \"is proportional to\", i.e., constants 13 \nare left out for simplicity).  Equation ES1 follows a similar relation found empirically in 14 \nearlier flume experiments (Meyer-Peter and Muller 1948).  Because the bed shear stress 15 \n\u03c4b = Cd\u03c1wU2, where Cd is a bed friction factor, \u03c1w is seawater density, and U is mean 16 \nflow velocity above the bottom boundary layer, Equation ES1 can also be written Qb \u221d 17 \nCd3\/2U(U2-U02) where U0 corresponds with \u03c40.  Thus, for a bed of uniform and 18 \nunchanging Cd, flow significantly faster than U0 leads to approximately Qb \u221d U3. 19 \n Nielsen (1992) described how Equation ES1 could arise based on Bagnold's 20 \noriginal arguments.  The mobile bedload imposes a normal stress \u03c3e on the lower 21 \nimmobile bed equal to the submerged weight of the bedload (allowing for buoyancy): 22 \n \u03c3 e = \u03c1g \u2212 \u03c1w( )g C(z)dz0\u221e\u222b  (ES2). 23 \n 49\nwhere \u03c1g is the sediment grain density, g is the gravitational acceleration, and C is the 1 \nsediment volumetric density.  Assuming that a simple Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion 2 \napplies to the top of the immobile layer (dashed line in Figure 1A) and that the shear 3 \nstress at that level equals the shear stress imposed by the current (i.e., the solid phase 4 \nacquires the current shear stress perfectly through grain to grain collisions (Bagnold 5 \n1963)), the flow-imposed shear stress is 6 \n \u03c4  =  \u03c40 + \u03c3etan\u03c6s (ES3). 7 \nwhere \u03c6s is the sediment's angle of internal friction.  The amount of bedload mobilized 8 \nthen relates to the excess imposed shear stress: 9 \n C(z)dz\n0\n\u221e\u222b = \u03c4 b \u2212 \u03c4 0\u03c1g \u2212 \u03c1w( )g tan\u03c6s   (ES4). 10 \nThus, the term (\u03c4b-\u03c40) in Equation ES1 could arise from friction - a larger imposed stress 11 \nmobilizes a greater amount of sand, leading to greater bedload flux.  Nielsen noted that 12 \ntoo few data are available on the velocities of individual grains to then predict the 13 \nresulting bedload flux, but the fact that various flux measurements follow Equation ES1 14 \n(Bagnold 1980; Nielsen 1992) suggests that mean particle velocities scale with flow 15 \nshear velocity, as found by tracking particles using high-speed film (Fernandez Luque 16 \nand van Beek 1976). 17 \n The effect of sloping beds is illustrated in Figure 1 (shear stress due to the 18 \ncurrent is omitted for simplicity).  For a longitudinal gradient, the normal stress in 19 \nEquation ES2 is modified by the factor cos\u03b3 and the total shear stress acting on the 20 \nthreshold surface includes the component of bedload weight.  Equation ES3 then 21 \nbecomes (Bagnold 1963): 22 \n \u03c4 = \u03c4 0 + (tan\u03c6s + tan\u03b3)cos\u03b3 \u03c1g \u2212 \u03c1w( )g C(z)dz0\u221e\u222b  (ES5). 23 \n 50\n(\u03b3 here is negative for a down-gradient.)  The amount of bedload of Equation ES4 1 \nshould then be modified, with greater amounts mobilized on down-gradients: 2 \n C(z)dz\n0\n\u221e\u222b = \u03c4 b \u2212 \u03c4 0(tan\u03c6s + tan\u03b3)cos\u03b3 \u03c1g \u2212 \u03c1w( )g  (ES6). 3 \n Bagnold (1963) derived Equation ES1 by assuming that the power expended by 4 \nthe shearing bedload was a simple proportion of the power expended by the current.  5 \nBagnold's energetics argument was extended to arbitrary slopes (Bailard and Inman 6 \n1981; Huthnance 1982a, 1982b) by assuming that the flux magnitude is proportional to 7 \nthe current's power expenditure but flux direction is governed by the vectorally 8 \ncombined stresses due to the current and down-gradient component of bedload weight.  9 \nThe bedload flux Qb is then: 10 \n Qb  =  S |u|2(u-\u03bb|u|\u2207H)\/g  (ES7) 11 \nwhere S is a constant, \u03bb = 1\/tan\u03c6s and \u2207H is bed gradient (bold symbols represent 12 \nvectors and |...| the vector magnitude). 13 \n Criticisms have been made concerning Bagnold's approach.  In his model, fluid 14 \nmomentum is transferred to moving particles so that the fluid shear stress becomes 15 \ninsignificant at the base of the mobile layer.  This only occurs, however, if the bedload 16 \nis well-developed, otherwise the bedload is better described as isolated saltating 17 \nparticles than as a continuous layer (McEwan et al. 1999; Ni\u00f1o and Garcia 1998; 18 \nSeminara et al. 2002).  Saltation models of varying complexity have been developed 19 \n(McEwan et al. 1999; Ni\u00f1o and Garcia 1994; Ni\u00f1o and Garcia 1998; Wiberg and Smith 20 \n1985, 1989), which variously incorporate particle extraction from the bed, trajectory, 21 \nrebound or deposition, and dislodgement of bed particles.  Trajectories are potentially 22 \naffected by lift caused by fluid shear or particle rotation (Leeder 1979).  Despite their 23 \n 51\ncomplexity, these models can reproduce the variations in Equation ES1 remarkably well 1 \n(e.g., McEwan et al. 1999). 2 \n Sekine and Parker (1992) summarized models of bedload on transverse slopes.  3 \nThey suggested that the components of flux down-gradient qn and in the direction of the 4 \ncurrent qs can be separated.  If there is no current down-gradient, their ratio is 5 \n qn\/qs  =  -B tan\u03b3;   B = B0(\u03c4c\/\u03c4b)m (ES8). 6 \nDepending on the model, the coefficient B0 incorporates the sand friction coefficient 7 \nand other parameters.  The different models summarized by Sekine and Parker 8 \n(Engelund 1974; Hasegawa 1981; Ikeda 1982; Kikkawa et al. 1976; Parker 1984; 9 \nStruiksma et al. 1985), their own results of numerical simulations of saltation, and a 10 \nmore recent model based on entrainment rates varying with shear stress (Parker et al. 11 \n2003) predict m = 0 to 1.0.  If qs \u221d \u03c4b1.5 (Equation ES1, omitting the threshold for 12 \nsimplicity), such values of m imply that the down-gradient flux variation lies between qn 13 \n\u221d \u03c4b1.5 (i.e., qn \u221d u3) and qn \u221d \u03c4b0.5 (qn \u221d u1).  The wind-tunnel data of Ikeda (1982) and 14 \nrecent model of Parker et al. (2003) are consistent with qn \u221d \u03c4b1.0 (qn \u221d u2) for large \u03c4b. 15 \n Given the diversity of theoretical predictions, experiments are needed to inform 16 \nthis question, but few are available and most were carried out with longitudinal 17 \ngradients.  Damgaard and co-workers (Damgaard et al. 2003; Damgaard et al. 1997) 18 \nused a recirculating flume in which flow rate was held fixed but the longitudinal 19 \ngradient varied.  In the first set, fine sand (median diameter d50 = 208 \u03bcm or \u03c6 = 2.3) 20 \nwas injected into the base of the flume with a piston controlled such that the injection 21 \nrate exactly matched removal as bedload.  Bedload fluxes derived from sand pickup rate 22 \nare shown in Figure 2A for three different sets of experiments made with different flow 23 \n 52\nrates.  They show the expected increasing flux with increasing down-slope gradient, 1 \nwith an abrupt increase towards the sand angle of repose. 2 \n In their second study at higher flow rates (Damgaard et al. 2003), sediment-trap 3 \nmeasurements (representing largely bedload) show a systematic variation with bed 4 \ngradient.  Ripples, however, formed on the bed, significantly affecting suspended 5 \nsediment fluxes because of sand thrown into suspension at ripple crests.  Hence, 6 \nsuspended sediment fluxes (gray-filled circles in Figure 2B) are varied and peak at -5\u02da 7 \nrather than at maximum gradient.   The effect of ripples was complex because different 8 \nripple morphologies formed at different bed gradient, leading to varied suspension.  9 \nTheir flow speed of 0.35 m\/s measured 13 cm above bed is comparable with maximum 10 \nspeeds measured near the shelf edge (Huthnance et al. 2002).  Considering that ripples 11 \nare observed around the shelf edge (Yorath et al. 1979), varied suspension could be a 12 \nfurther complication, but Figure 2B nevertheless shows a general tendency for fluxes to 13 \nincrease with increasing down-gradient. 14 \n Further experiments (Fernandez Luque and van Beek 1976; Smart 1984) 15 \ndocumented effects of longitudinal gradients.  In Smart's experiment, flux increased 16 \nwith S0.6 (where S is bed gradient) but included some suspended transport.  Fernandez 17 \nLuque and van Beek's experiments recorded an effect of gradient on the threshold of 18 \nmotion, and bedload flux correlated moderately well with excess stress corrected for the 19 \ngradient effect. 20 \n Japanese experimental results with transverse gradients (Hasegawa 1981; 21 \nYamasaka et al. 1987) shown in Sekine and Parker (1992) are reproduced in Figure 2C 22 \n(those of Hasegawa were carried out in water whereas those of Yamasaka et al. were 23 \ncarried out in air).  Based on Equation ES10, the trend in the data should reveal the 24 \n 53\nvalue of the exponent m.  The main group of data were claimed (Sekine and Parker 1 \n1992) to be consistent with m = 0.25, which implies qn \u221d tb1.25 (qn \u221d u2.5). 2 \n The theoretical and experimental results therefore suggest that bedload flux 3 \nshould be affected by bed gradient, with a component down-gradient, Qb = -K|\u2207H|.  4 \nAlthough not well constrained, the Japanese data suggest that the dependence of K on 5 \ncurrent speed u probably lies between K \u221d u2 and K \u221d u3.  If threshold effects are also 6 \nconsidered, a variation K \u221d (u-uo)2 could produce morphological results similar to K \u221d 7 \nu3.  As the published current meter data do not allow threshold effects to be fully 8 \naccounted for, we have compared current variations with morphology assuming that K 9 \nlies between K \u221d u2 and K \u221d u3, but threshold effects may need to be considered in 10 \nmore accurate interpretations. 11 \n 12 \nBAGNOLD, R.A., 1963, Mechanics of marine sedimentation, in Hill, M.N., ed., The 13 \nSea, 3: New York, Wiley, p. 507-528. 14 \nBAGNOLD, R.A., 1980, An empirical correlation of bedload transport rates in flumes 15 \nand natural rivers: Royal Society, Proceedings, v. 372A, p. 453-473. 16 \nBAILARD, J.A., and INMAN, D.L., 1981, An energetics bedload model for a plane 17 \nsloping beach: local transport: Journal of Geophysical Research, v. 86, p. 2035-2043. 18 \nDAMGAARD, J., SOULSBY, R., PEET, A., and WRIGHT, S., 2003, Sand transport on 19 \nsteeply sloping plane and ripple beds: Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, v. 129, p. 20 \n706-719 , DOI: 10.1061\/(ASCE)0733-9429(2003)129.:9(706). 21 \nDAMGAARD, J.S., WHITEHOUSE, R.J.S., and SOULSBY, R.L., 1997, Bed-load 22 \nsediment transport on steep longitudinal slopes: Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, v. 23 \n123, p. 1130-1138. 24 \nENGELUND, F., 1974, Flow and bed topography in channel bends: American Society 25 \nof Civil Engineers, Journal of the Hydraulics Division, v. 100, p. 1631-1648. 26 \nFERNANDEZ LUQUE, R., and VAN BEEK, R., 1976, Erosion and transport of bed 27 \nload sediment: Journal of Hydraulics Research, v. 14, p. 127-144. 28 \nHASEGAWA, K., 1981, Bank-erosion discharge based on a non-equilibrium theory: 29 \nJapanese Society of Civil Engineering, Transactions, v. 316, p. 37-52 (in Japanese). 30 \nHUTHNANCE, J.M., 1982a, On one mechanism forming linear sand banks: Estuarine, 31 \nCoastal and Shelf Science, v. 14, p. 79-99. 32 \nHUTHNANCE, J.M., 1982b, On the formation of sand banks of finite extent: Estuarine, 33 \nCoastal and Shelf Science, v. 15, p. 277-299. 34 \nHUTHNANCE, J.M., HUMPHERY, J.D., KNIGHT, P.J., CHATWIN, P.G., 35 \nTHOMSEN, L., and WHITE, M., 2002, Near-bed turbulence measurements, stress 36 \n 54\nestimates and sediment mobility at the continental shelf edge: Progress in 1 \nOceanography, v. 52, p. 171-194. 2 \nIKEDA, S., 1982, Lateral bed load transport on side slopes: American Society of Civil 3 \nEngineers, Journal of the Hydraulics Division, v. 108, p. 1369-1373. 4 \nKIKKAWA, H., IKEDA, S., and KITAGAWA, A., 1976, Flow and bed topography in 5 \ncurved open channels: American Society of Civil Engineers, Journal of the 6 \nHydraulics Division, v. 102, p. 1327-1342. 7 \nLEEDER, M.R., 1979, Bedload dynamics: Grain impacts, momentum transfer and 8 \nderivation of a grain Froude number: Earth Surface Processes, v. 4, p. 291-295. 9 \nMCEWAN, I.K., JEFCOATE, B.J., and WILLETTS, B.B., 1999, The grain-fluid 10 \ninteraction as a self-stabilizing mechanism in fluvial bed load transport: 11 \nSedimentology, v. 46, p. 407-416. 12 \nMEYER-PETER, E., and MULLER, R., 1948, Formulas for bedload transport, paper 13 \npresented at 2nd IAHR Congress, International Association for Hydraulics Research, 14 \nStockholm. 15 \nNIELSEN, P., 1992, Coastal bottom boundary layers and sediment transport: Advanced 16 \nSeries on Ocean Engineering, vol. 4: Singapore, World Scientific Publishing. 17 \nNI\u00d1O, Y., and GARCIA, M., 1994, Gravel saltation:  2.

In particular, the mean current 14 \nmeasured with mechanical current meters is known to be affected by superimposed oscillating currents, 15 \nsuch as from surface waves, because of the finite response time of the rotors and direction vane.  The 16 \ninstruments measure the wave current when it adds to the mean current but under-record when the wave-17 \ncurrent reverses, leading to a net bias.  In one study (Beardsley 1987), when wave currents had root-18 \nmean-squared amplitudes equal to half the mean current velocity, the measured current was in error by 19 \n10% and greater for larger oscillating current amplitudes.  These measurements will also not be 20 \nparticularly representative of the instantaneous current speed (due to both wave and mean current) in such 21 \nsituations.  These issues are not expected to affect the arguments in this paper greatly because we are 22 \nconcerned with variations below 150 m where high-frequency oscillating currents tend not to penetrate. 23 \n Potential errors in the calibration formulae that have been used at Woods Hole Oceanographic 24 \nInstitution to relate rotor speed to current speed have been noted by Lentz et al. (1995).  Their comparison 25 \nof a mechanical current meter with an acoustic current meter suggested that the error increased linearly to 26 \naround 2.5 cm\/s at a speed of 30 cm\/s.  If it had affected the results of Csanady et al. (1988) and Butman 27 \net al. (1988) (these papers unfortunately lack calibration details), the values in Fig. 5A will have been 28 \nexaggerated by around 1 cm\/s at 10 cm\/s mean speed and less at depth.  This will have steepened the 29 \ngraph slightly but not sufficiently to affect the arguments in the paper. 30 \n 31 \n 32 \nREFERENCES 33 \nBEARDSLEY, R.C., 1987, A comparison of the vector-averaging current meter and New Edgerton, 34 \nGermeshausen, and Grier, Inc., vector-measuring current meter on a surface mooring in Coastal 35 \nOcean Dynamics Experiment: Journal of Geophsical Research, v. 92, p. 1845-1859. 36 \nBUTMAN, B., NOBLE, M., and FOLGER, D.W., 1979, Long-term observations of bottom current and bottom 37 \nsediment movement on the mid-Atlantic continental shelf: Journal of Geophsical Research, v. 84, p. 38 \n1187-1205. 39 \nBUTMAN, B., 1988, Downslope Eulerian mean flow associated with high-frequency current fluctuations 40 \nobserved on the outer continental shelf and upper slope along the north-eastern United States 41 \ncontinental margin: Implications for sediment transport: Continental Shelf Research, v. 8, p. 811-840. 42 \nCSANADY, G.T., CHURCHILL, J.H., and BUTMAN, B., 1988, Near-bottom currents over the continental 43 \nslope in the Mid-Atlantic Bight: Continental Shelf Research, v. 8, p. 653-671. 44 \nHUTHNANCE, J.M., HUMPHERY, J.D., KNIGHT, P.J., CHATWIN, P.G., THOMSEN, L., and WHITE, M., 2002, 45 \nNear-bed turbulence measurements, stress estimates and sediment mobility at the continental shelf 46 \nedge: Progress in Oceanography, v. 52, p. 171-194. 47 \nLENTZ, S.J., BUTMAN, B., and WILLIAMS, A.J., 1995, Comparison of BASS and VACM current 48 \nmeasurements during STRESS: Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technologies, v. 12, p. 1328-49 \n1337. 50 \nMCCLENNEN, C.E., 1973, New Jersey continental shelf near bottom current meter records and recent 51 \nsediment activity: Journal of Sedimentary Petrology, v. 43, p. 371-380. 52 \nTHOMSEN, L., VAN WEERING, T.C.E., and GUST, G., 2002, Processes in the benthic boundary layer at the 53 \nIberian continental margin and their implication for carbon mineralization: Progress in Oceanography, 54 \nv. 52, p. 315-329. 55 \n___________________________________________________________________________________ 56 \n 59\nES3.  BOTTOM CURRENTS FROM SHIP ADCP DATA OFF IBERIA 1 \n Data were collected with a hull-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler 2 \n(ADCP) during a cruise off the Iberian margin shown in Figure ES3 (Huthnance 1997).  3 \nThe ship traversed the margin repeatedly, crossing the 200 m contour at 20 random 4 \ntimes with respect to the tidal cycle.  Although the 10 day period of the cruise is short 5 \ncompared with some oceanographic variations, these data provide a further indication of 6 \nhow the magnitude of seabed oscillations varies with water depth, in relatively mild 7 \nJune conditions (Huthnance 1997). 8 \n The ADCP vector currents were corrected for ship motion and converted to 9 \ncurrent vector magnitudes.  Bathymetry along the ship tracks was derived by 10 \ninterpolating (Smith and Wessel 1990) 50 m contours of the General Bathymetric Chart 11 \nof the Ocean (GEBCO) above 200 m depth (IOC, IHO and BODC, 2003) along with 12 \nmultibeam bathymetry of the slope (NERC 2001).  To derive near-bed current speeds, 13 \nwhile allowing for bathymetry inaccuracy due to incomplete coverage, we selected all 14 \ncurrent data within 60 m of the seabed.  The solid line in Figure 5B then represents the 15 \nmedian average near-bed current as a function of the local water depth and dotted lines 16 \nshow the inter-quartile range of current speeds. 17 \n Because the ADCP averages current data over typically 5 minutes, the trend in 18 \nFigure 5B excludes effects of long-period surface waves (swell), affecting the shallower 19 \ndepths.  Northerly winds during the cruise favored upwelling, and interestingly this 20 \nshould have produced currents decreasing inversely with water depths, similar to those 21 \nobserved.  The Ekman surface current is expected to have a volumetric transport flux 22 \nrelative to its underlying water that relates to the wind stress rather than depth, but its 23 \nsqueezing into shallow water leads to stronger currents.  If the upwelling flux is Q, the 24 \n 60\nbottom-layer onshore current is ub, total depth H, and upper water layer thickness hu, 1 \nthen the absolute upper-layer flux offshore is Q - ubhu.  The lower-layer flux onshore is 2 \nub(H - hu).  These two transport fluxes cancel at the coast, so combining the above 3 \nsuggests ub = Q\/H,, i.e. flow in the lower layer inversely proportional to water depth, 4 \nsimilar to that observed in Figure 5B.  This analysis applies over shelf depths 100 to 200 5 \nm, but friction affects flow in shallower depths and upwelling can occur mid-depth in 6 \ndeeper water. 7 \n 8 \nHUTHNANCE, J.M., 1997, Cruise report RRS Charles Darwin 105, 29 May to 22 June 9 \n1997.
