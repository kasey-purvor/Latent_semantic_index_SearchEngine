It\nsuggests that Ali el Tom\u2019s authority was a creole product, which drew on local\nmoral codes and colonial forms of authority, but was not fully part of either.

Whether\nor not the speaker actually possessed any fluency in the language they\nappropriated, this was a device which simultaneously asserted confident\nmastery of an exotic people and claimed membership of an elite group of men\nwho knew the language and the country; the command of language was, as\nDianna Jeater has noted, an \u2018esoteric skill \u2019.2 Yet these linguistic cross-overs\nhave further significance, if we consider the nature of the colonial adminis-\ntrator\u2019s task as one of turning policy devised in one language into a practice of\nrule which was spoken in another \u2013 or, as the author of the example above\nrather more carefully put it, \u2018 interpreting to [the tribes] policy and instruc-\ntions\u2019.3 The terms from this interpretation which blow back into the\n* I should like to thank the anonymous referees of the Journal, and the members of the\nseminar group at the Institute of African and Asian Studies, University of Khartoum and\nthe African Studies seminar of the University of Oxford, all of whom endured earlier\nversions of this paper.

The untranslatability of certain terms hints at the existence\nof a space which lies between the worlds of colonizer and colonized \u2013 to what\nsome would call hybridization.4 But the evocation of Homi Bhabha may be\nproblematic \u2013 partly because hybridization (with its implications of the\ngenetic mixing of two clearly distinct strains) seems a curiously inappropriate\nterm for cultural processes, but also because Bhabha\u2019s focus on mimicry and\nthe \u2018mimetic or narcissistic demands of colonial power\u2019 misstates the am-\nbitions and fears of both colonizers and colonized. The emergence of a lan-\nguage and practice of rule might more usefully be seen as a creolization \u2013 not\nin Benedict Anderson\u2019s limited definition of the emergence of a colonial\nculture of purely European extraction, but rather with the full linguistic\nimplications of that term \u2013 the emergence of something new, through cul-\ntural processes, which was more than simply a blend of its constituent parts.5\nIn Condominium Sudan, hukm and naswere terms in a system of governance\nwhich lay between and beyond the moral and linguistic worlds of colonizer\nand colonized.Hukm connoted a complex bundle of judicial practices associ-\nated with \u2018native administration\u2019; at its most basic, it meant the ability\nto punish through a government-recognized court. Nas referred to those\nwithout authority of any sort \u2013 the \u2018subjects\u2019, in the full sense in which\nMahmood Mamdani uses the word.6\nThis paper concerns the hukm of one of the most famous \u2018native auth-\norities\u2019 of the Sudan: Ali el Tom, the nazir \u2013 the government recognized\nparamount \u2013 of the Kababish, whose status as the beau ide\u00b4al of British\nimaginings of traditional nomad Arab rule has been widely noted by aca-\ndemics.7 It explores one particularly revealing example of the exercise of his\nhukm, and in so doing recurs to a familiar theme of African history in this\nperiod \u2013 the central importance of judicial innovation in changing the nature\n4 H.

Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of\nNationalism (London, 1991), 47, gives the narrow definition of \u2018Creole \u2019.

Mamdani, Citizen and Subject. Contemporary Africa and the Legacy of Late\nColonialism (Princeton, 1996). Hukm is derived from a root with multiple forms and\nimplications across the Arabic-speaking world; it relates to spheres of order, control,\nmedicine and justice. This paper will argue that in Condominium practice, pulled from\nArabic not-quite-into English, this particular word had a simpler register, describing the\nact or power of punishing through a government-recognized court. Nas ( ) is a word\nused more widely in Arabic to mean \u2018people\u2019, but in the Condominium it was used as the\nplural form of zol, a word used for ordinary rural Sudanese, whose derivation from the\nroot apparently hints at loss and separation.

Interestingly, a Condominium guide to polite usage clearly differ-\nentiated between nas \u2013 used to describe the subjects of a headman \u2013 and ahl, translated as\n\u2018folk\u2019, implying people of some significance: V.

Across\nthe continent the law was, as Martin Chanock has put it, \u2018 the cutting edge\nof colonialism\u2019. In British territories \u2018customary law\u2019 was central to the\nattempts to \u2018regularize\u2019 or \u2018strengthen\u2019 or \u2018revive\u2019 \u2013 the terminology varied,\nthough the implication did not \u2013 the allegedly traditional powers of those on\nwhose assistance they relied.8 Yet the familiarity of the theme should not\nobscure the diversity of historical experience: some courts produced mul-\ntiple appeals to higher authority, others did not; some were flooded with\n\u2018cases\u2019, and others were not. As Richard Roberts and Kristin Mann have\nshown (and as Brett Shadle has recently reminded us), courts were not\nalways arenas for the unquestioned exercise of colonial and patriarchal\npower.9 One might say, crudely, that some of these experiments in \u2018tra-\nditional \u2019 justice did what administrators hoped they might do \u2013 maintain\norder with minimal supervision, and without generating substantial re-\nsistance \u2013 and others did not. The example discussed here is of a court which\nusually did what administrators hoped, but on one occasion did not; this one\naberration suggests how judicial innovation could work so effectively, and\nhow it could create a novel governance \u2013 a creole governance, born of local\ncircumstance and speaking its own, novel language, in which the bounds of\npropriety were uncertain.\nABBADI ALI AND HIS WIFE KHADIJA\nIn March 1936, Ali Salim Bilal went on a tax-collecting mission at Marakh,\nin the northern part of Sudan\u2019s Kordofan Province. Ali Salim\u2019s only formal\nposition was as a member of the native administration court which operated\nunder the authority of the recognized nazir, or ruler, of the Kababish tribe.\nBut Ali Salim was the son of Salim Bilal, the president of the local subordi-\nnate court, and he was also the nephew of Salim Bilal\u2019s brother, Ali el\nTom \u2013 the nazir of the Kababish, to whom Salim Bilal\u2019s court was subordi-\nnate, and the effective ruler of the whole vast swathe of northern Kordofan,\nsome 50,000 square miles in all, which formed a sub-district of its own and\nwas routinely known as Dar Kababish \u2013 the land of the Kababish.10\nThe use of relatives in administration was a central element of Ali el Tom\u2019s\nrule. He relied heavily on members of his Nurab section, and particularly the\nAwlad Fadlallah lineage, who monopolized membership of the main court\nof Dar Kababish. This clan rule was bolstered by the employment of\nvarious other agents, who were not related to Ali el Tom but were his per-\nsonal clients, raised from poverty and obscurity in his service. British officials\naccepted, and even encouraged, the use of this retinue of family and clients\nfor \u2018routine work\u2019 ; one approvingly quoted a nicely ambiguous comment\non the attitude of Ali el Tom\u2019s brother, Muhammad, to his constant\n8 M.

An extra-legal routine, as it happened,\nfor he would have followed established practice in extracting from the people\nconsiderably more than the tax which was formally due, or was recorded.\nThe handful of European administrators with intimate knowledge of Dar\nKababish all knew that its people paid an additional tax, of grain from cul-\ntivators and livestock from pastoralists, which was used by Ali el Tom to\nbuild up his own wealth, to reward his followers and to bestow largesse upon\nthe many people who sought personal assistance from him.12 But (with one\nbrief and soon-abandoned exception) no administrator had ever tried to\nprevent this \u2013 and they had suppressed the findings of zealous Sudanese\nsubordinates who had collected information on such malpractice.13\nBut on this occasion Ali Salim went away with more than some additional\ntax. His eye was caught by a beautiful woman. Accounts of what happened\nnext differed markedly. Ali Salim was to argue, later on, that he had enquired\nas to whether the woman was available for marriage, and had been told that\nshe was; he had therefore hastened to pay the requested brideprice and had\nsummoned a feki, a medical practitioner-cum-Islamic scholar, to witness the\nmarriage. Khadija, the woman herself, told a different story; she insisted that\nshe had made it very clear that she was already married, but that Ali Salim\nhad bullied or bribed her family into saying, untruthfully, that she had been\ndivorced by her first husband, and into accepting the bride price of \u00a3E10 and\neleven cloths:\nThere came to meHamid Ali andMohamed Ahmed el Neam who is my [maternal]\nuncle, khal, and told me that Ali Salim wished to marry me. I told them that I am\nalready the wife of Abbadi Ali, but they said this man is an influential man and we\ncannot refuse his request.14\nIt seems curious that Ali Salim\u2019s suspicions were not aroused when his\nbride fled, but he claimed that he was quite unaware of her protests, and of\nany question over her status; although, according to one account, when\nKhadija\u2019s mother publicly insisted that her daughter was married \u2018she was\nbeaten with whips and insulted\u2019.15 Khadija\u2019s actual husband, Abbadi Ali,\nwas in Omdurman on business; learning of his wife\u2019s remarriage when he\nfound Ali Salim in his home on his return, he set off at once for the camp\nof the Kababish nazir to protest. Again, accounts of what happened next\n11 Kordofan Province Monthly Diary, June 1938, NRO 1CIVSEC 57\/8\/32; \u2018The\nregularisation of the Kababish tribal administration\u2019, attached to Charles de Bunsen,\nAssistant District Commissioner (ADC) Soderi to Governor Kordofan, 1 Jan. 1934,\nNRO 1CIVSEC 1\/36\/97; T.

Abbadi Ali claimed that he had presented family\nwitnesses who testified that he and Khadija were still married. According to\nhim, Ali el Tom told him he would not get his wife back, and dismissively\noffered him one pound in compensation; one of his statements also alleged\nthat his brother-in-law had been \u2018threatened\u2019 in the court for insisting that\nKhadija was already married. Interestingly, this detail was omitted from his\nsecond statement, which was translated into English.16 Ali el Tom, on the\nother hand, claimed that he had convened a formal meeting of the Kababish\ncourt (of which there seems to have been no record) which investigated\nAbbadi Ali\u2019s complaint and found that there was no evidence that he was still\nmarried to Khadija.17\nAbbadi Ali, enraged, left Ali el Tom\u2019s camp (in the west of Dar Kababish)\nand travelled back east, picking up Khadija on the way. He went on, out of\nDar Kababish, to Omdurman, where he went to see the Muslim judge, the\nqadi, at theMuhammedan Law Court, orMLC. The qadiwas in a quandary;\nhe had no authority to deal with this case (for reasons which will be discussed\nbelow) but Abbadi\u2019s story alarmed him, and he wrote to the office of the\nLegal Secretary, under whose supervision the MLCs operated, asking for\nadvice. Ali el Tom, meanwhile, had heard news of Abbadi Ali\u2019s flight. He\nreported to the police that Abbadi Ali had abducted Khadija, and asked that\nhe be arrested; and he locked up various members of Khadija\u2019s family and\nmade it known that they would not be released until Abbadi Ali and Khadija\nreturned to Dar Kababish.18 But it was too late; the Acting Legal Secretary\nrefused to order Abbadi Ali\u2019s forcible return to Dar Kababish.19 He also\nauthorized the qadi to investigate the case, and sent enquiring letters to the\nGovernor of Kordofan.20\nThis immediately inflamed the chronically sensitive relationship between\nthe Legal Secretary, as head of the judiciary, and the Civil Secretary, who\nwas head of the Sudan Political Service (SPS), the cadre of administrators.\nAs Martin Daly has shown, the policy of devolution had allowed the civil\nsecretaryship to accrue power up to the mid-1930s at the expense of the legal\nsecretaryship, and the Civil Secretary responded to what seemed in effect to\nbe a challenge to this.21 He protested that the investigation represented in-\nterference; and after a fewweeks theLegal Secretary returned from leave, and\nordered the qadi to drop the case \u2013 which had anyway been frustrated be-\ncause it was not possible for the qadi to get evidence from any party except\nAbbadi Ali and Khadija.22 Abbadi was ordered to return to Dar Kababish,\nwhere his appeal would be heard by the Assistant District Commissioner\n16 Statements, Abbadi Ali, 29 May 1936 (in Arabic) and 3 June 1936 (translated into\nEnglish), NRO 1CIVSEC 41\/1\/9.\n17 De Bunsen, ADC Soderi to Governor Kordofan, 21 Nov. 1936, NRO 1CIVSEC\n41\/1\/9.\n18 Petition, Abbadi Ali, 1 Nov. 1936; de Bunsen, ADC Soderi to Governor Kordofan,\n21 Nov. 1936, NRO 1CIVSEC 41\/1\/9.\n19 Acting CS to Governor Kordofan, 5 Aug. 1936, 1CIVSEC 41\/1\/9.\n20 Acting Legal Secretary (LS) to Governor Kordofan, 6 June 1936, NRO 1CIVSEC\n41\/1\/9.\n21 M.W.

De Bunsen himself later claimed that he had misunder-\nstood his instructions, and had thought he had been ordered not to hear the\nappeal. After three months languishing, with Khadija in hiding with relatives\nand various members of her family still detained, Abbadi Ali broke bond and\nreturned to Omdurman to petition the Legal Secretary.24 This produced\nmore rapid progress; de Bunsen announced that he had re-read the instruc-\ntions, understood them and was now setting about hearing the appeal \u2013 while\ncomplaining bitterly that Abbadi Ali had broken bond.\nThe accounts of the appeal are also a little contradictory. De Bunsen de-\nscribed convening a council, or meglis, of local notables who decided that\nAbbadi Ali and Khadija were married, and that Ali Salim had been the vic-\ntim of duplicity by Khadija\u2019s family, who had sought to make money by\nmarrying her off to this unsuspecting, wealthy, man. The qadi, according to\nde Bunsen, had been unable to give advice and was \u2018sent back to Bara at once,\nat his own request\u2019.25 De Bunsen\u2019s replacement, Philip Hogg, who had just\narrived to take over the sub-district, wrote a retrospective account in which\nthe decision was actually the result of investigation by a police inspector,\nwhose findings were merely confirmed by the meglis. The police inspector,\nhowever, suggested that it was Ali Salim who had bribed Khadija\u2019s family to\nlie, because he wished to marry her.26 This opinion did not make its way into\nde Bunsen\u2019s official account, or into the written account of the meglis de-\ncision. Both of these laid the blame entirely on Khadija\u2019s family, and rec-\nommended that not only should they refund the bridewealth \u2013 now alleged\nto have been \u00a3E31 and 24 sheep \u2013 but that they should also be punished for\nlying.27 De Bunsen insisted that this punishment should be set not by himself\nbut by the court of Ali el Tom. He wrote: \u2018 [Ali el Tom] is anxious that those\nwho misled his relations should be punished, in his court. He says that he\ndoes not wish to give them heavy sentences, but that the tribe should see and\nrealize that he had \u2018\u2018hukmed\u2019\u2019 them\u2019. De Bunsen emphasized the point, and\nrepeated the use of the key word: \u2018all of them deserve to be \u2018\u2018hukmed\u2019\u2019 for\ntheir lying and misleading Ali Salim\u2019.28\nDe Bunsen\u2019s desire to allow the further punishment of Khadija\u2019s family\nwas gratified \u2013 though the provincial governor did not pursue the wistful\nhope, expressed in the same letter, that Abbadi Ali himself might be pun-\nished for not having followed the proper procedures for complaint. And\nthere the story ended despite a brief flurry of interest, and an evident\nawareness among officials in Khartoum, including the Deputy Civil\nSecretary, that \u2018a grave miscarriage of justice has taken place\u2019.29 Abbadi Ali\n23 Acting CS to Governor Kordofan, 5 Aug. 1936, NRO 1CIVSEC 41\/1\/9.\n24 Petitions, Abbadi Ali, 1, 4 and 5 Nov. 1936, NRO 1CIVSEC 41\/1\/9.\n25 De Bunsen, ADC Dar Kababish to Governor Kordofan, 21 Nov. 1936, NRO\n1CIVSEC 41\/1\/9. 26 Hogg, \u2018Memoir of Soderi \u2019, SAD 815\/11\/7-33.\n27 \u2018Translation of meglis decision\u2019, Nov. 1936, NRO 1CIVSEC 41\/1\/9.\n28 De Bunsen, ADC Dar Kababish to Governor Kordofan, 21 Nov. 1936, 1CIVSEC\n41\/1\/9. 29 Minute, Deputy CS, 10 Dec. 1936, NRO 1CIVSEC 41\/1\/9.\n34 JUSTIN WILLIS\nand Khadija were reunited \u2013 but at substantial cost to Khadija\u2019s family, and\nwith the uncomfortable knowledge that they had earned the enmity of the\nrulers of Dar Kababish. Local administrators quickly set about minimizing\nthe impact of these events \u2013 reminding their superiors, on every possible\noccasion, that this was the first time that any complaint had ever been made\nby a Kababish against the rule of Ali el Tom, and insisting that the affair had\nreceived far more attention than it deserved.30\nThe exceptionality of the case is striking. There really were no other\nrecorded complaints from Kababish, though plenty of people from neigh-\nbouring groups had complained of Ali el Tom\u2019s behaviour.31 But it might be\nargued that the case was more significant than de Bunsen and his colleagues\nallowed, for it offers a unique window on to the processes which made Dar\nKababish such an apparently tranquil domain. Multiple questions are raised\nby the story of Abbadi Ali : about the willingness of administrators to con-\ndone evident injustice, and the ultimate willingness of senior officials to\naccept this; about Ali el Tom\u2019s apparent willingness to flout both Muslim\nlaw and Kababish custom. In essence, all these recur to the apparent\nuniqueness of the case: can the story of Khadija and Abbadi Ali help us to\nunderstand why no one else ever complained to the government about Ali el\nTom? It is a reformulation of the question which Talal Asad addressed in his\nwork on the Kababish, which Chanock has identified as a wider issue, and to\nwhich Thomas Spear has recently returned in his essay on the \u2018limits of\ninvention\u2019: why was an exploitative and actually innovatory \u2018customary\u2019 rule\naccepted by those upon whom it was imposed?32\nThere is one obvious answer. These events certainly suggest the extent\nto which British support for Ali el Tom made resistance to his rule both\ndifficult and foolhardy, offering a clear example of what some have seen as\nthe invention of despotic neo-traditional rule in colonial Africa \u2013 indeed,\nan unusually clear example.33 This paper will suggest that this example\nenhances our understanding of that process, by illustrating the way in which\nit was morally and intellectually possible for this to happen, for Sudanese and\nBritish involved in the processes of rule. But it also illustrates the bounds of\nthat process.\nAsad has offered two lines of explanation for Kababish acceptance of Ali el\nTom\u2019s rule. He argued that there was no \u2018consent\u2019 involved; it was rather\nthat Kababish men accepted Ali el Tom\u2019s rule as legitimate, in so far as it\nserved their principal interest, which was the maintenance of a domestic\nsphere, in which the male-headed household was an autonomous economic\nunit.34 But he also laid much stress on the Kababish idea of sulta, the power\n30 De Bunsen, ADC Dar Kababish to Governor Kordofan, 21 Nov. 1936, 1CIVSEC\n41\/1\/9; de Bunsen, handing-over notes, 1936, SAD G\/\/S 1204 file 6.\n31 The absence of any complaint from Dar Kababish was noted in 1915, and reaffirmed\nby later observers: Davies, \u2018Report on Dar Kababish\u2019, SAD 627\/1\/1-21.

One concerns the interaction between\nBritish officials and the ambitions of Ali el Tom and his family. It was this\nwhich was to produce the formal structures which embodied the Kababish\nhukm, and which led British officials to exclude this hukm from their moral\njudgement \u2013 in effect suspending the \u2018repugnancy\u2019 criteria which suppos-\nedly constrained customary law.38 The second concerns wider Kababish\nideas about disputes and their resolution, and the location of justice, which\nallowed the creeping advance of hukm but could also define the terms in\nwhich this could be exercised.\nALI EL TOM: \u2018THE PARFAIT GENTIL KNIGHT\u201939\nAli el Tom \u2013 \u2018AT\u2019, as he was routinely abbreviated by administrators \u2013 was\nby 1936 a legendary figure. Descended from a line of hereditary rulers, his\nfather and uncle had been killed by the Mahdists in the 1880s; his uncle had\nthe unusual distinction of having inspired a character in a G. A. Henty\nnovel.40 Ali el Tom was recognized as ruler of the Kababish by the British\nas soon as they took control of Kordofan in 1900: a recognition that was seen\nby the British as a restoration, just as the occupation of the Sudan was a\n\u2018reconquest\u2019. Since that time \u2013 after a brief period of uncertainty \u2013 Ali el\nTom had grown in authority and reputation, particularly among the Britons\nof the administrative branch of the Sudan government \u2013 the SPS. Early\nallegations that he abused his power were deflected by sympathetic provincial\ngovernors: \u2018Ali Tom is one of the best Arab sheikhs I know, keeps his people\nin great order and pays his tribute always to the day and very [sic] obedient to\nany orders I give him\u2019.41 In 1919 he was a member of the Loyalty Delegation\nwhich travelled to congratulate King George on the British victory; he was\nhonoured first as a Member of the Victoria Order, then with the King\u2019s\nMedal for African Chiefs, and then finally as a Knight of the Order of the\nBritish Empire.

The explicit intention of all this\nlegislation was both to preserve and \u2018revive\u2019: \u2018 to give the existing Tribal\nCustom a yet surer form of recognition\u2019, but also to extend and reform the\npower of \u2018traditional\u2019 rulers.48 Enamoured as they were of \u2018tradition\u2019,\nBritish administrators were quite open about their intention to invent where\nnecessary, and to push for a steady growth in scale. \u2018Traditional\u2019 units\nwhich were too small were not viable, they argued \u2013 they could not operate\neconomically (and economy was a constant theme, with all suggestions for\n\u2018devolution\u2019 supported by complicated tables detailing the savings in costs\nwhich would result) ; nor could they survive in the face of wider social\nchange. Courts must embody tradition \u2013 but they had also to assist in the\nremaking of tradition, and in the creation of larger \u2018tribes\u2019.49\n42 For a potted biography, see the obituary, evidently written by Douglas Newbold, in\nKordofan Monthly Diary, Feb. 1938, NRO 1CIVSEC 57\/8\/32.\n43 Lea, On Trek in Kordofan, 31; R.

Strikingly, faced\nwith the possibility that the elimination of injustice and corruption might\nendanger tradition, administrators were explicit in their insistence that a\ndegree of corruption and injustice was tolerable: \u2018 it can hardly be doubted\nthat there will be a great deal of favouritism, bias and corruption when\nNative Administration has become normal routine\u2019.50 The feeling against\n\u2018over-formalization\u2019 was most evident in northern Kordofan. Here, local\nadministrators repeated the argument made some years earlier, that formal\nrecognition would compromise Ali el Tom\u2019s judicial authority, for recog-\nnition required definition, and definition implied limitation: \u2018to regularise\nwith warrants and rules what is now naturally there might wreck it \u2019, opined\none District Commissioner.51 Laws required the issue of warrants for courts,\nexplicitly stating what cases might be heard in them (routinely excluding\nslavery and homicide cases from their jurisdiction). They laid down the\npermissible limits of punishment. Most worryingly of all, they came to re-\nquire that all judgements be recorded in writing, and fines taken as punish-\nment be recorded and accounted for.52 And so neither the 1922 ordinance,\nnor any of the legislation which followed it, was immediately applied to Dar\nKababish.\nAdministrators in Kordofan found all these provisions difficult because\nthey ran directly counter to their understanding of how Ali el Tom\u2019s auth-\nority worked. As they repeatedly argued \u2013 on occasion, quoting from\nDoughty\u2019s Arabia Deserta as authoritative evidence on the subject \u2013 Ali el\nTom was the embodiment of a social order which despised regulation and\nfunctioned solely on honour.53 This was the untouched world of the desert\nnomad, where wise and just judgements sprang from an inherited sense\nof right and a commitment to shared values which was maintained by the\npurity of nomad life. As the provincial governor who penned Ali el Tom\u2019s\nobituary wrote, \u2018AT\u2019 was \u2018simple in his habits, direct in speech, tireless in\nthe saddle and expert in camels and grazing and on nomad Arab customs and\nrights\u2019.54 In some cases, administrators knew, Ali el Tom gave judgements,\nor inflicted punishments, which would exceed any legally acceptable\ndefinition of the bounds of his authority. If he were to become a \u2018table\nSultan\u2019 \u2013 constrained by warrants, hemmed in by the recording and scrutiny\nof decisions \u2013 his freedom of action would be lost and this system of\n50 MacMichael, CS, to Governor Kordofan, 23 Mar. 1929, NRO 1CIVSEC 1\/33\/92.\n51 \u2018Notes on native court for Soderi District \u2019, Hamilton, DC Bara, 7 Jan. 1929, NRO\n1CIVSEC 1\/33\/92. \u2018Over-formalization\u2019 was explicitly identified as a danger in Gillan,\nGovernor Kordofan to CS, 27 Aug. 1930, NRO 1CIVSEC 1\/35\/94.\n52 Craig, for CS to all governors, 8 Nov. 1928; see draft warrants with Acting Governor\nKordofan to CS, 3 Sept. 1928, NRO 1CIVSEC 1\/33\/90.\n53 C.

By the 1930s, administrators in the\nprovincial capital at El Obeid, as well as those in northern Kordofan itself,\nwere fretting over what the future might bring: challenges to AT from\ntribesmen spoiled by contact with the town; a successor to AT who\ncommanded less respect, and had a less sure grasp of the sense of honour?\nAnd so, with a gloomy sense that nothing they might do would ever equal\nthe simplicity and fairness of the system they were replacing, they began\nto introduce the formal structure of courts to the Kababish.57\nAli el Tom had clearly expressed his distaste for formal courts; and his fear\nof supervision was so great that he had suspected that the teacher supplied\nfor his children by the government might be some sort of spy.58 But he did\nnot resist the push to \u2018regularize\u2019 his rule. Indeed, towards the end of the\nnegotiations he actually offered to bear personally any additional costs associ-\nated with the introduction of formal courts.59 He did so for two reasons. On\nthe one hand, he was well aware of the ways in which the colonial state had\nprovided means for him to extend his wealth and influence, notably through\nthe manipulation of the taxation system \u2013 he did not wish to lose his favoured\nposition. On the other hand, there really was an issue of honour at stake. Both\nAli el Tom and his subjects had become uncomfortably aware that elsewhere\nin Kordofan status was increasingly judged through reference to the formal\nstructure of the courts. The details of sentencing powers, and the subordi-\nnation of one court to another, were keenly observed.60 When members of\nother tribes stole from, offended or injured Kababish; or when Kababish\nwere accused of offences against others, Ali el Tom was confronted with\nother nazirs whose formally recognized powers were much greater than his\nown.61 This compounded the affront which had long been offered to Ali el\nTom by non-Kababish who lived in and around the area which he regarded\nas Dar Kababish. He had no formal power over such people.

AT had, generally speaking,\nrun rings around the Kawahla nazirs, consistently outdoing them in securing\nthe favour of British administrators.62 Yet the Kawahla as a group remained\nindependent, to Ali el Tom\u2019s annoyance.63\nIn prolonged negotiations, pursued over some three years between 1931\nand 1934, Ali el Tom adroitly turned British concerns to his advantage,\nsecuring an arrangement which brought him formally into the structures\nof indirect rule in return for some extraordinary concessions.64 He was to\nbecome, like other nazirs, a salaried official \u2013 but on a salary, \u00a3E1,450, which\nsubstantially exceeded that paid to any other nazir. He had the right to\nappoint a series of other salaried deputies, or wakils, as well as retainers, and\nhe would sit as the president of a Kababish court which would have three\nsubordinate courts; and it was in effect promised to him that in the near\nfuture the Kawahla court would be added to these subordinate courts \u2013 a\npromise that was made good within a year, with British administrators also\nmaking clear that they intended to bring other minor groups under his court\nin the near future: \u2018 in the course of time, Dar el Kababish should comprise\nonly one unit, under Sir AT\u2019.65 The Kababish nazir was given the largest\npowers of sentencing possible. And, discreetly, administrators \u2013 evidently\nacting with the approval of their superiors \u2013 indicated that they would not\nexpect of his court the kind of detailed record-keeping which was required of\nothers.\nSh. Ali asked whether, under the proposed Native Administration, he would have\nto write down and treat as \u2018cases\u2019 all the various small offences which he at present\ndeals with merely by imposing some \u2018slavish\u2019 task on the guilty party, such as\ndrawing water or hewing wood. Mr Lea replied that the Government wanted\nnothing better than to leave the Kababish to be dealt with according to their\ncustomary justice so long as crime was kept down and the tribe remained\ncontented.66\nThus was created Ali el Tom\u2019s hukm, a power to judge which was not\n\u2018traditional\u2019 \u2013 but was also not subject to the rule of the law. This was\n\u2018regularization\u2019 without regularity.\nThe practice of these courts, and their physical nature, were to follow a\npattern already suggested for other Arab nomad courts in Kordofan.

The teacher who travelled with\nAli el Tom had described Ali el Tom\u2019s settling of cases before the\n\u2018regularization\u2019 \u2013 AT sat alone on a rope bed, the focus of activity, while all\nothers sat on the ground before him.68 There seems to have been no im-\nmediate change to this practice after 1934, and administrators were repeat-\nedly to stress how Ali el Tom himself bore personally a vast burden of\njudicial work: \u2018Sir Ali el Tom had an almost continuous 30 hours session of\nsettling unimportant disputes at Um Badr\u2019.69 But in material appearance,\nand rhetoric, the native administration courts were intended to stand in clear\ncontrast to another kind of court recognized by the Condominium, which\nwas regarded by the administrators of Kordofan as the embodiment of all the\nmost baleful aspects of formal bureaucracy \u2013 the MLC.\nAccepted, and even encouraged, by British administrators in the first two\ndecades of the Condominium (when they saw formally trained Muslim\nscholars as the essential antidote to populist holy men on the model of the\nMahdi), the MLCs had fallen into severe disfavour with the formalization of\nindirect rule in the 1920s.70 As the SPS set about the creation of a local\nadministration rooted in the power of \u2018traditional\u2019 justice, the existence of an\nalternative legal system became extremely problematic, even though the\noperations of the MLC were largely confined to \u2018matters of personal status\u2019.\nWould the power of shaykhs and nazirs not be undermined if their subjects\ncould turn from their courts and seek instead the judgement of the MLC\nin disputes over marriage and inheritance?71 That the judges of the MLCs\nwere often graduates of the qadi school at Gordon College only served to\nintensify this concern: they were representatives of the formally educated\neffendiyya class whose loyalty had been shown to be suspect in the turbulent\nyears of the Egyptian revolution and the White Flag revolt ; \u2018young and\nhalf-educated lawyers\u2019 of the kind whom many British administrators\ndespised.72\nThe SPS, supported by the office of the Civil Secretary, fought a deter-\nmined campaign to oust the MLCs, at least from rural areas, and preferably\n67 Report, Hamilton, attached to Gillan, Governor to all DCs, 5 Nov. 1930, and\nHamilton, \u2018Native administration courts\u2019, May 1931, NRO 1CIVSEC 1\/35\/94;\nJ.

Most revealingly, it was said that MLCs had\nan advantage over native administration courts because they possessed\n\u2018Government prestige and atmosphere\u2019.74 The chief qadi, and the office of\nthe Legal Secretary, resisted this administrative campaign; the chief qadi\nbased his argument on the simple principle that Muslims should, if they\nwish, have the right to have marriage and inheritance cases heard according\nto sharia law; the Legal Secretary argued that abolishing the MLCs would\noffend the effendiyya too greatly to be worth trying.75 The SPS nonetheless\nsucceeded in restricting the physical movement of the qadis, specifically\nexcluding Dar Kababish from their operations. They were also successful in\nincorporating in many court warrants a general proviso that the courts of\nnazirs and shaykhs could hear cases which were subject to sharia law as long\nas they convened a panel which contained a member \u2018learned in sharia\u2019, and\nas long as the parties to the case consented \u2013 which, in practice, came to mean\nas long as they did not make very clear and obvious objection.76 Once they\nhad \u2018consented\u2019, the case could never go before an MLC \u2013 the appeal from\nshaykhs\u2019 and nazirs\u2019 courts were to the District Commissioner, not to the\nqadi, whatever the nature of the case.\nThe Kababish courts created in 1934 contained such provisos in their\nwarrants, and it was clear that administrators understood them to be the\nantithesis of the MLCs, and intended that there should be no overlap or\ncontact of any kind between the systems.77 That was why Abbadi Ali\u2019s\nattempt to secure the help of the qadi at Omdurman was ultimately\nunsuccessful \u2013 he had no jurisdiction in this case. And it was also why de\nBunsen seems to have been so reluctant to hear the appeal with the qadi from\nBara present, even though he had been instructed to seek his advice. To\ninvolve the qadi in this way would have been to accept the possibility that\nanother system of justice might challenge that of Ali el Tom. Hence the rapid\ndismissal of the qadi and the summoning of the meglis (whose four members,\nincidentally, included Ali el Tom\u2019s son and Ali bin Salim\u2019s father).78\nDe Bunsen and his immediate superiors harked back repeatedly to their\nargument that Abbadi Ali himself had caused much of the problem by not\n73 Gillan, Governor Kordofan to LS, via CS, 24 Feb. 1929, NRO 1CIVSEC 1\/33\/92;\nDavies, \u2018Further steps in devolution\u2019, 20 Jan. 1930, and Kordofan response to ques-\ntionnaire on devolution, n.d. 1931, NRO Kordofan 1\/1\/1.\n74 Mayall, DC En Nahud to Governor Kordofan, 21 Dec. 1928, NRO 1CIVSEC 1\/33\/\n92; Gillan, Governor Kordofan to CS, 10 Apr. 1930, NRO 1CIVSEC 1\/34\/93.\n75 LS to CS, 30 Apr. 1930; \u2018Note by Grand Kadi\u2019, 17 May 1931 NRO 1CIVSEC\n1\/35\/94; minutes of meeting at the Palace, 10 Nov. 1929; CS to all governors, 17 Nov.\n1929, NRO 1CIVSEC 1\/34\/93.\n76 See for example Rules, with Gillan, Governor Kordofan to CS, 29 June 1929, NRO\n1CIVSEC 1\/34\/93.

Ali el Tom possessed the power to hukm ; his people were absolutely\nsubject to that power, and his power to hukm was to be supported, rather\nthan qualified, by the police inspector, the DC and the government as a\nwhole. As de Bunsen cheerfully observed, in notes written just after the\nAbbadi Ali case:\nSir AT\u2019s own main court should be left without undue interference except in\nimproving the entering of cases and the paying-in of fines (as long is justice is\ndispensed the first is not an intrinsically important matter \u2026).80\nJUSTICE, HONOUR AND IDENTITY IN NORTHERN KORDOFAN\nFrom the early years of the Condominium, British administrators had\nasserted the \u2018traditional \u2019 basis of the judicial system operated by their chosen\nagents. But as Asad\u2019s work has shown, the process which administrators had\nseen as one of \u2018regularization\u2019, and even of reduction of his powers, might be\nbetter understood as the creation, consolidation and expansion of a judicial\nidentity for the Kababish which had never previously existed.81\nNo evidence has ever really been offered to show that that there was any\nkind of central dispensation of justice for the Kababish in the nineteenth\ncentury. Despite the orotund certainty of the assertion (embedded in the\n1922 Powers of Nomad Sheikhs Ordinance) that Arab nomad sheikhs had\nwielded judicial power \u2018since time immemorial \u2019, at least some colonial ad-\nministrators were actually well aware that Kababish identity was a relatively\nrecent construct, and that individuals and whole sections (or \u2018clans\u2019, as some\nwould call them) moved in and out of this identity. HaroldMacMichael, who\nproduced some of the most fulsome prose on the subject of the enduring\npatriarchy of nomad Arabism, also went to some lengths to insist that the\nKababish were a \u2018highly complex conglomeration of component parts\u2019.82 As\nDaly drily notes, some of the enthusiasts of native administration who cited\nMacMichael\u2019s work either \u2018had not read it or hoped that their readers had\nnot\u2019.83\nThe very limited sources for the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries\nall suggest, in fact, that the system of justice and the resolution of dis-\nputes in northern Kordofan were both layered and decentralized.84 Under\n79 Newbold, Governor Kordofan to CS, 16 Nov. 1936, NRO 1CIVSEC 41\/1\/9.\n80 De Bunsen, handing-over notes, 1936, SAD G\/\/S1204 file 6.\n81 Asad, The Kababish, 157\u201379.\n82 MacMichael, The Tribes of Northern and Central Kordofan, 172\u201399.

It was the relationship\nthat gave the shaykh al-mashaykh his power: \u2018The great chief alone oppresses\nthem, but this he is enabled to do from his influence with the Turks\u2019.85 There\nis no evidence that the crucial areas of potential dispute \u2013 over access to\ngrazing and water, over the location and return of strayed or stolen livestock,\nover marriage or inheritance disputes, over the control of slaves \u2013 were dealt\nwith by the shaykh al-mashaykh, or involved any reference to the idea of\nKababish identity. In 1911, the Seligmans found that it was heads of sections\nwho played the crucial role in most dispute settlements \u2013 not the nazirs, and\nthis presumably had also been true in the nineteenth century. This was a\nsociety for which the idea of a collective identity served principally as a\nmeans to regulate relations with the happily distant Turks, or occasionally to\norganize resistance to grand acts of hostility by other \u2018tribes\u2019, notably the\nBeni Jerar.86\nThe role of Islam in settling disputes in the nineteenth century is even\nmore uncertain. The feki, with a limited degree of Islamic knowledge and\nsome mastery of writing and geomancy, was not a common feature of\nKababish society, but by the early twentieth century some of these in-\ndividuals were involved in the magical detection of thieves; there were\nhowever no mosques and no resident learned scholarly community. There\nwere certain people and places in the region possessed of a degree of signifi-\ncance, which could be used to administer oaths to help settle disputes: a\nshrine at Bara and a pilgrimage site on the Nile. By 1918 fekis had become\nmore common; Ali el Tom himself had developed a particular relationship\nwith a lineage of fekis belonging to the Tijaniyya order, but it is not clear how\nrecent this development was.87\nThe creation, from this unpromising start, of a hukm which covered a\ndefined area evidently owed much to British enthusiasm for the Kababish,\nand Ali el Tom in particular. This gave Ali el Tom a new control over re-\nsources, backed by the known, if erratic, ability of the British to use their\npolice to enforce decisions relating to water and grazing access \u2013 an ability\ndemonstrated most dramatically in the forcible expulsion of the Hawawir\nfrom Dar Kababish in 1913\u201314, and shown again in 1926 when the Gumuiya\nwere forced to acknowledge Ali el Tom\u2019s rights over the grazing land which\n85 M.

Those Hawawir or Gumuiya who accepted Ali el Tom\u2019s authority\nwere allowed access to the resources of Dar Kababish \u2013 others were ex-\ncluded.88 The tone of negotiations in 1927 between Ali el Tom and the nazir\nof the Kawahla suggested that Ali el Tom\u2019s hukmwas steadily extending over\nall the nomads who occupied the area \u2013 now defined by boundaries on the\nmap \u2013 known as Dar Kababish.89 Just as hukm became expressive of the\nexpected relationship between nazir and subject, dar \u2013 again, a word long in\nuse, but acquiring new significance \u2013 came to assert a unique claim to the\nresources of a territory, associated with the power of hukm. In 1915, the brief\nexperiment of collecting tax directly, instead of through Ali el Tom, was\nimmediately abandoned when it seemed that this might call into question Ali\nel Tom\u2019s position as the sole intermediary between Kababish and govern-\nment: at least some officials were apparently aware of the extent to which\nboth the Kababish and their leader were innovations, based on this inter-\nmediacy.90 Douglas Newbold (who himself enjoyed a substantial change in\ncircumstance, rising from Assistant District Commissioner Dar Kababish to\nCivil Secretary in the course of 16 years) remarked posthumously of his old\nfriend AT that \u2018He made the tribe. He was the tribe\u2019.91 Ali el Tom acquired\nan immediate following of clients whom he supported; more widely those\nwho accepted his power to judge enjoyed access to the resources he con-\ntrolled, and to his support in disputes with others.92 Those household or\nsection heads who defied or evaded this authority would lose his support \u2013\nand could also find the tax lists changed to punish them and encourage\nthe defection of their followers to Ali el Tom\u2019s own, ever-growing, section.93\nThe layered world of justice and dispute resolution was steadily flattened\ninto the singular process of hukm : as de Bunsen had observed in 1934, \u2018The\n\u2018\u2018Government\u2019\u2019 is entirely in the hands of Sir Ali himself \u2019.94 Davies had\ncommented in 1915 on the way that Ali el Tom\u2019s authority combined fear\nwith reward: \u2018The Nazir inspires a very real fear in all his people, but at the\nsame time it is always with obvious pride that a Kabbashi [the singular]\nannounces himself as belonging to \u2018\u2018Sheikh Ali\u2019\u2019 \u2019.95\n88 Governor Kordofan to Assistant Director of Intelligence, 17 Feb. 1914, NRO\nINTEL 2\/46\/393; Governor Kordofan to Assistant Director of Intelligence, 3 Apr. 1914,\nand sub-mamur Kababish to Inspector, 19 May 1914, NRO INTEL 2\/35\/294; Governor\nKordofan to Governor Khartoum, 10 July 1926, and Acting CS to Governor Khartoum,\n4 Feb. 1926, NRO 1 CIVSEC 66\/4\/30.\n89 The Kawahla nazir was particularly anxious to secure Ali el Tom\u2019s assurance that\nhe would cease to hukmKawahla; the assurance was given, but probably not fulfilled: see\nthe Shurut (binding agreement) attached with ADC Soderi, 4 July 1927, NRO 1CIVSEC\n41\/1\/7.\n90 Davies, \u2018Report on Dar Kababish\u2019, 9 June 1915, SAD 627\/1\/1-21 (especially the\nsection on \u2018Future policy\u2019 with marginalia by Wingate).\n91 Notes of talk with Douglas Newbold, Margery Perham, 1938: Rhodes House, MSS\nPerham 131, f. 122.\n92 Seligman and Seligman, \u2018The Kababish\u2019, 115, describes the growing body of clients\nwho settled around Ali el Tom; see also Lea, On Trek in Kordofan, 31\u20132, 65; petition\nfrom Gummoeia, n.d. 1926, NRO 1CIVSEC 66\/4\/30.\n93 Asad, The Kababish, 171\u20137; Lea, On Trek in Kordofan, 80, 119.\n94 \u2018The regularisation of the Kababish administration\u2019, de Bunsen, ADC Dar\nKababish to Governor, 1 Jan. 1934, NRO 1CIVSEC 1\/ 36\/97.\n95 Davies, \u2018Report on Dar Kababish\u2019, SAD 627\/1\/1-21.\nCREOLIZATION OF AUTHORITY 45\nIn 1931, there were still section heads who tried to maintain their right to\nsettle cases, and who were punished by Ali el Tom (and threatened by British\nadministrators) for doing so.96 But the move away from this was inexorable.\nThere is very little evidence of the kind of cases which came to the nazir, or\nof the identity of the plaintiffs \u2013 such was Ali el Tom\u2019s success in deflecting\nscrutiny. A set of scribbled notes from Margery Perham suggest that \u2018Arab\ncourts\u2019 in northern Kordofan dealt very largely in theft cases, with violence\nand adultery as substantial minor themes, but it is not clear how she derived\nthese statistics.97 Anecdotal comments on the sheer volume of business con-\nducted by Ali el Tom\u2019s court suggest that Chanock\u2019s argument \u2013 that such\ncourts dealt largely with cases of disobedience to authority, while domestic\ndisputes were settled in other ways \u2013 does not apply in this case.\nThis was a period of new strains and challenges in nomad society in\nnorthern Kordofan. There was no significant growth in wage employment or\nlabour migrancy, but there were economic changes. The provision of trans-\nport camels, a principal source of income in the nineteenth century, saw one\nlast glorious boom in the years up to 1915 (delivering particular wealth to Ali\nel Tom, who acted as intermediary in supplying camels to government and\ntook most or all of the proceeds). But the completion of the railway to El\nObeid in 1912 undermined this business, and from the 1920s it was the\nsale of camels, for meat or other use, and the sale of sheep, which provided\nthe bulk of the cash which came into nomad society for paying tax and\nbuying cloth, sugar and other luxuries.98 Kababish men devoted considerable\nenergy to building up flocks and herds for this trade \u2013 as well as for the sheer\npleasure of owning camels. They were able to build ever larger herds because\nAli el Tom secured them not only preferential access \u2013 indeed, a near\nmonopoly \u2013 of most of northern Kordofan, but also access to the grazing\nwhich sprang up to the west and north after the rains.99\nThe increasing range of movement which this involved raised new chal-\nlenges. The household, the stock-owning unit, was only occasionally physi-\ncally united, and its members were routinely hundreds of miles apart for long\nperiods. The perennial problems over labour, fidelity and resource use\nwithin households were magnified by this. So too were the equally perennial\nconflicts between households, over strayed livestock and accusations of theft.\nThese new challenges coincided with the growth of Ali el Tom\u2019s power of\npatronage; that many sought to meet these challenges by affirming their\nstatus as \u2018Sheikh Ali\u2019s people\u2019 and accepting his hukm seems unsurprising. It\nis possible that most of those who sought this hukm were household heads.\nWith the exception of slave cases \u2013 mentioned below \u2013 the few details which\nare recorded suggest that it was men who brought cases, and it is presumably\nsignificant that it was Abbadi Ali, not Khadija or her mother, who com-\nplained to the nazir.\n96 Lea, On Trek in Kordofan, 83\u20137; Asad, The Kababish, 130.\n97 Notes, by Margery Perham: Rhodes House, MSS Perham 131, f. 39.\n98 For the nineteenth-century transport work, see MacMichael, The Tribes of Northern\nand Central Kordofan, 189; for Ali el Tom\u2019s role in this up to 1915, Davies, \u2018Policy in Dar\nKababish\u2019, SAD 627\/1\/1-21; for the camel and sheep trade see notes by Margery\nPerham: Rhodes House, MSS Perham 131, f. 123. 99 Nagila, Dhikrayati, 160\u20137.\n46 JUSTIN WILLIS\nBut why, in these circumstances, had no dissatisfied women or men pre-\nceded Abbadi Ali in seeking alternative judgement, from the government or\nfrom the qadi? Davies himself had recorded the vivid language of a com-\nplainant elsewhere in Kordofan who sought to appeal to a British official :\n\u2018The turban will not ease me! The tarbush will not ease me! I want the\nhelmet! \u2019.100 The Kababish reluctance to seek the assistance of \u2018the helmet\u2019\nwas not a result of ignorance: however officials might romanticize the iso-\nlation of the nomads, there was actually constant movement from northern\nKordofan to the towns, for the livestock trade required this. And many men\nof Ali el Tom\u2019s generation, including the nazir himself, had actually been\nbrought up in or around Omdurman, under Mahdist rule, were literate and\nmust have been entirely familiar with the existence of sharia courts.101 So\nwhy did they spurn tarbush and helmet, and accept Ali el Tom\u2019s rulings?\nFor all Kababish, men and women, Ali el Tom\u2019s hukm had one profound\nadvantage. British officials\u2019 idea of \u2018honour\u2019 as a sort of birthright of pure\nArabs may have been grossly essentializing, and the implication that a shared\nsense of honour would lead to the consensual resolution of all disputes is\nclearly unsound. Honour could drive conflict along, rather than resolving\nit. But for the people of northern Kordofan, their incessant struggles with\none another to control resources \u2013 water, grazing and labour \u2013 were routinely\nperceived as matters of honour. Disputes between men over access to wells,\nor over grazing rights, or strayed animals; disputes between men over\nwomen; disputes between men and women over sex and children, or over\nhousehold resources and residence \u2013 all were matters of honour, for women,\nas well as men. It was honourable to assert rights \u2013 a woman\u2019s right to be\nclothed, or not to have to move endlessly with the animals; a man\u2019s right to\nwater his stock; a husband\u2019s exclusive rights over his wife\u2019s sexuality. A\nsense of honour impugned, or humiliation suffered, could and very often did\nlead to violence. When attempts were made to regulate the judicial powers of\nother nomad nazirs before 1922, a carefully graded list of physical retali-\nations were the most clearly defined \u2018offences\u2019 : shetima (\u2018abuse\u2019), kaff\n(\u2018striking with hand\u2019), sowt (\u2018striking with whip\u2019), asaia (\u2018striking with\nwhip\u2019), ta\u2019an (\u2018 injury with knife\u2019) and others.102 These gradations revealed a\nculture of resource conflict, with constant challenges to honour and physical\nresponses \u2013 which might be carefully gauged but might also spin out of\ncontrol. There was a profound reluctance to accept the involvement either\nof sharia law or of an intrusive state, which would treat as murder the killing\nof a man found in another man\u2019s tent, and would regard the vigorous\nassertion of a claim to water as a criminal assault. This alien law presented\nthose who felt that their honour had been challenged with an unpalatable\nchoice: to act according to the dictates of honour, and face the consequences;\nor to obey the law and act dishonourably.\nIn contrast, Ali el Tom\u2019s hukm offered clear advantages. It might in itself\nbe innovatory, and it might be exercised in ways which consistently favoured\nthe Awlad Fadlallah and other Nurab, and extracted additional fees and costs\n100 Davies, The Camel\u2019s Back, 86.\n101 As Ali el Tom\u2019s teacher noted, with some wonder: Nagila, Dhikrayati, 29.\n102 Specimen powers, with Governor Kordofan to CS, 26 May 1920, NRO 1CIVSEC\n1\/9\/30.\nCREOLIZATION OF AUTHORITY 47\nfrom ordinary Kababish. But it avoided any involvement by the government,\nthe hakumat ; and it seems clear that officials were right when they noted that\nmost Kababish perceived the government law as absolutely alien and hostile,\nand shared Ali el Tom\u2019s contempt for \u2018the Sudan Penal Code, and its failure\nto coincide at most points with Arab law and custom\u2019.103 It was this which\nmade it easier for Ali el Tom to discourage those who wished to complain\ndirectly to the ADC \u2013 a task to which he occasionally applied himself with\nsome determination, as Lea noted after watching him \u2018weed\u2019 a group of\nwould-be plaintiffs: \u2018Ali el Tom does not allow unimportant matters to go to\nthe DC, but sifts the complainants\u2019.104 This desire to exclude the govern-\nment, to keep some aspects of life away from the hakumat, is suggested by the\nalmost complete absence in written sources \u2013 notably Lea\u2019s comprehensive\ntrek diaries \u2013 of any mention of domestic disputes. Occasional cases did come\nfrom Ali el Tom\u2019s hukm to the ADC: murders, which were in theory beyond\nAli el Tom\u2019s powers (though in practice he was allowed to deal with those\noccurring within the tribe), and major thefts or affrays.105 But the only\ndomestic cases which seem to have reached the ADC concerned slaves \u2013 and\nthese were handled in a way which confirmed the utility, for Kababish men,\nof accepting Ali el Tom\u2019s creole authority.\nSlavery was not recognized in the Condominium, and dealing in slaves was\nillegal. But many Kababish owned slaves, and relied on them particularly for\ndrawing water and for cultivation. The British policy was rigorously to\nsuppress slave-trading and to give any existing slave who demanded freedom\na document stating that they were free.106 But Kababish continued to obtain a\ntrickle of slaves, by purchase and kidnap, and Ali el Tom was resolutely\nuncooperative in the suppression of this practice (unsurprisingly, since\nmembers of his family \u2013 including Ali Salim\u2019s father \u2013 were allegedly among\nthose involved). Those who accepted his hukm thereby gained also a degree\nof protection.107 In Dar Kababish British officials routinely dissuaded slaves\nfrom seeking freedom papers, by pointing out to those who applied that they\nwould be without any means of subsistence, and by threatening to deport\nthem from the district.108 Ali el Tom could not hear slave cases \u2013 his warrant\nforbade this. But he or one of his family was almost always around when\nslaves sought freedom papers, or complained of ill-treatment, dispossession\nor denial of rights; slaves were routinely fobbed off by the ADC and denied\nany proper hearing. In none of the cases which Lea mentioned in his journal\ndid slave complainants receive any redress.109 Again, the implication was\nclear \u2013 Ali el Tom\u2019s hukm might be novel and intrusive, but it offered pro-\ntection from an even more alien and intrusive system. For free Kababish, it\n103 Lea, On Trek in Kordofan, 233; Reid, Inspector Dar Kababish to Governor, 24\nMar. 1918, NRO INTEL 2\/46\/393; Asad noted that the view of \u2018the government\u2019 as alien\nwas still very clear in the 1960s: \u2018Political inequality\u2019, 143.\n104 Lea, On Trek in Kordofan, 251. 105 Ibid. 38, 80, 230.\n106 Lea, \u2018Explanatory note\u2019, 15, in Lea, On Trek in Kordofan.\n107 Inspector Bara to Governor, 6 Dec. 1913, INTEL 2\/46\/393; ? to Assistant Director\nof Intelligence, 25 Mar. 1914, NRO INTEL 2\/35\/294; Lea, On Trek in Kordofan, 231;\nextract from July 1934 Monthly, in NRO 1CIVSEC 60\/7\/24.

Faced with this kind of innovation Abbadi Ali was willing to turn\ninstead to the unfamiliar world of theMLC, even though many nomad Arabs\nallegedly shared the British suspicion of these alien courts. And he was\nwilling to go further, and petition the hakumat itself, when this became\nnecessary: he was not simply a disgruntled troublemaker, as de Bunsen\nimplied, but neither was his action the tip of an iceberg of suppressed dis-\ncontent. Rather, it represented a moment in the prolonged argument over the\nnature and bounds of the power of hukm : with Abbadi Ali turning to an\nalternative which had been made less terrifying, and perhaps less alien, by\nthe encounter with the \u2018regularized\u2019 court of Ali el Tom.\nCONCLUSION\nThe Abbadi Ali affair was soon forgotten. Ali el Tom continued to use the\ncourts to spread his authority, as administrators approvingly noted: \u2018A new\nbranch of the Kababish court was opened at Safia, with the object of\nincreasing Sh. Ali el Tom\u2019s authority in this area\u2019. Ali el Tom himself bore\nthe initial costs of establishing this court, so keen had he become on these\ninstitutions.110The erasure of Abbadi Ali\u2019s story (and it was perceived as this,\nnot as Khadija\u2019s story) was so complete that when Ali el Tom died, in\nFebruary 1938, British eulogists recurred, without exception, to the theme of\nthe nazir as the epitome of all that was best about traditional authority, a man\nagainst whom no complaint had ever been heard: \u2018 in 37 years never a\npetition\u2019.111 Abbadi Ali had succeeded in establishing that Ali el Tom\u2019s hukm\nmust respect the claims of matrimony; but not in calling the nazir\u2019s authority\ninto question, or in encouraging any reform in the practice of his courts.112\nHistorical analysis of the development of a culture of governance in\nCondominium Sudan has tended to concentrate on a perceived long-term\nconflict between the urban, bureaucratic culture of the effendiyya on the one\nhand and the neo-traditional world of the nazirs on the other. But the story of\nKhadija and Abbadi Ali suggests that this impression of polarity may mis-\nlead, for in Dar Kababish \u2013 just as Olufemi Vaughan has recently argued of\nroughly contemporaneous processes in Nigeria \u2013 colonial subjects were\nfinding themselves increasingly subject to a new kind of authority which\nrolled multiple forms of power over resources together and delivered them\n110 Kordofan Province Monthly Diary, Jan. 1938; and Governor Kordofan to CS,\n2 Oct. 1938, NRO 1CIVSEC 1\/38\/100.\n111 \u2018Notes on talk with Douglas Newbold\u2019, Margery Perham, 1938: Rhodes House\nMSS Perham 131 f. 122.\n112 Asad commented on the continuing dominance of the courts by a small clique: The\nKababish, 68.\nCREOLIZATION OF AUTHORITY 49\ninto the hands of men whose position relied on the state.113 The power of\nthese men was located in institutions and practices which served their\nambitions, and provided Kababish house heads with a degree of continuity\nand familiarity in resource control, so that Ali el Tom, like the chiefs de-\nscribed by Vaughan, could project himself as \u2018a custodian of cherished local\nvalues amidst rapid social change\u2019.114 But this custodianship drew the\nKababish ever further into acceptance of a new kind of governance defined\nby words extracted from Arabic, yet not quite translated into English, which\nhung uncertainly between languages and worlds. Both subjects and rulers\nmight see in this governance patterns of morality and behaviour which were\nfamiliar; yet its morality was actually uncertain. The institutions and prac-\ntices of this governance were not part of the written system of the Sudan\ngovernment, nor part of the world of sharia law; nor did they fit into themoral\neconomy of pastoral nomadism. This governance was not the product of\n\u2018colonial mimesis\u2019 \u2013 indeed, it was often driven by precisely contrary forces,\nas both colonizer and colonized struggled to maintain distance. Rather,\nKababish acceptance of the intrusive and sometimes extractive operations of\nAli el Tom\u2019s authority rested on its partial compatibility with an established\nmoral economy of hierarchy and accumulation. Yet this familiarity could be\nillusory. On occasion, this creole governance could reveal itself as profoundly\ninnovative, alien and unfamiliar. Khadija\u2019s story (as we may call it) suggests\nhow, in practice, the \u2018limits of invention\u2019 were constantly being tested.\n113 O.
