The EISCAT high power heating facility at\nTroms\u00f8, northern Norway, has been utilised to generate arti-\nficial radar backscatter in the fields of view of the CUTLASS\nHF radars. It has been demonstrated that this technique of-\nfers a means of making very accurate and high resolution ob-\nservations of naturally occurring ULF waves. During such\nexperiments, the usually narrow radar spectral widths as-\nsociated with artificial irregularities increase at times when\nsmall scale-sized (high m-number) ULF waves are observed.\nPossible mechanisms by which these particle-driven high-m\nwaves may modify the observed spectral widths have been\ninvestigated. The results are found to be consistent with Pc1\n(ion-cyclotron) wave activity, causing aliasing of the radar\nspectra, in agreement with previous modelling work. The\nobservations also support recent suggestions that Pc1 waves\nmay be modulated by the action of longer period ULF stand-\ning waves, which are simultaneously detected on the magne-\ntospheric field lines. Drifting ring current protons with ener-\ngies of \u223c 10 keV are indicated as a common plasma source\npopulation for both wave types.\nKey words.

How-\never, such radars have also been utilised in the study of many\nmore localised phenomena. This paper describes their ap-\nplication to the study of the ionospheric signatures of ULF\nwaves. A bistatic pair of these radars called CUTLASS (Co-\noperative UK Twin Located Auroral Sounding System; Mi-\nlan et al., 1997) have overlapping fields of view, which, in\ntheir standard operational mode, encompass the ionosphere\nover northern Scandinavia and the northern polar cap region\nat higher latitudes (Fig. 1). The EISCAT (European Inco-\nherent Scatter) Scientific Association operates a high power\nHF facility or \u201cHeater\u201d (Rietveld et al., 1993) in the vicinity\nof Troms\u00f8, Norway, which is also in the CUTLASS field of\nview. A coordinated CUTLASS-EISCAT experiment, desig-\nnated OUCH (Observations of ULF waves with CUTLASS\nand the Heater; e.g. Wright and Yeoman, 1999a), was specif-\nically designed to make high spatial and temporal resolution\nmeasurements of these geophysical phenomena in HF radar\nbackscatter from ionospheric irregularities artificially gener-\nated by the heater (e.g. Yeoman et al., 1997).\nThe artificial backscatter technique has made particular\nprogress in the study of ULF waves \u2013 magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) waves of magnetospheric origin \u2013 with small spatial\nscale sizes and, consequently, large azimuthal wave num-\nbers, m (Yeoman et al., 1997; Wright and Yeoman, 1999a,\nb; Yeoman and Wright, 2001; Baddeley et al., 2002). The\nazimuthal wave number, m, is a measure of the scale size\nof a wave. It is defined as the number of degrees of phase\nchange of the wave per degree of longitude on the Earth. A\nhigh-m wave has a smaller azimuthal scale size (or wave-\nlength) than a low-m wave. Such waves have their energy\nsource in the drifting plasma which constitutes the Earth\u2019s\nring current and are generated by resonant wave-particle in-\nteractions. Non-Maxwellian particle distributions can exist\nin this plasma (for example, following plasma injections dur-\n170 D. M.

Also\nindicated are a number of magnetometers in the IMAGE network.\nThe shaded area indicates the extent of the high spatial and tem-\nporal resolution beam 5 of the Finland radar in the special OUCH\nexperimental mode. Data included in this study were exclusively\nmeasured on this beam, which overlays the high power heating fa-\ncility in Troms\u00f8, Norway.\ning substorms), availing free energy which can feed into field\nline eigenmodes when a resonance condition is satisfied (e.g.\nHughes, 1983). The electric field perturbations associated\nwith these waves drive ionospheric flows which can be de-\ntected by radars such as CUTLASS. The resulting energy\ndissipation, via Joule heating in the ionospheric plasma, rep-\nresents a major energy sink for the collisionless plasma in the\ninner magnetosphere (Baddeley et al., 2002).\nAt high latitudes, waves with frequencies in the Pc1 range\n(0.2\u20135 Hz) include both electrostatic ion cyclotron (ESIC)\nand electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves. In con-\ntrast to ground magnetometers, which measure the magnetic\nsignatures, radars detect changes in electric fields. Thus,\na ground magnetometer will only detect EMIC waves and\nthose ESIC waves that are associated with current systems\n(and therefore have a magnetic signature). Technically then,\nPc1 waves are those detected on the ground by magnetome-\nters.\nThe SuperDARN radars transmit a multipulse code and\nthe received signals for each range gate are converted into\nan autocorrelation function (ACF). Parameters such as the\nbackscatter power (relating to irregularity intensity), line of\nsight velocity of the scattering irregularities and the spectral\nwidth can be extracted from the ACF after it is processed\nusing the fitacf fitting routine (e.g. Villain et al., 1987). It\nis well known that the spectral width of coherent HF radar\nreturns is sensitive to the various regions of the ionosphere\nand the dynamic processes in the coupled magnetosphere-\nionosphere system (e.g. Baker et al., 1995; Lester et al.,\n2001; Woodfield et al., 2002). It has been suggested that\nthe increased spectral widths associated with radar backscat-\nter from the cusp are the result of ion-cyclotron wave activity.\nAndre\u00b4 et al. (1999, 2000a, b) modelled the effects of broad-\nband ESIC waves and narrow-band EMIC waves on HF radar\nobservations and showed that they are likely to be responsi-\nble for enhancing spectral widths as a result of the fast tem-\nporal changes they cause inside the relatively slowly sampled\nradar range cells. However, a recent paper by Ponomarenko\nand Waters (2002) states that the modelling code employed\nby Andre\u00b4 et al. (1999, 2000a, b) fails to account for time-\ndependent velocity variations and as a result, overestimates\nthe effects of ion-cyclotron waves on HF radar observations.\nAs a consequence, Ponomarenko and Waters (2002) favour\nsmall-scale spatio-temporal structures due to particle precip-\nitation inside a radar range cell, as the cause of the observed\nlarge spectral widths in the cusp regions.\nFor over 30 years the generally accepted generation mech-\nanism for ion-cyclotron waves was the Bouncing Wave\nPacket (BWP) model (Obayashi, 1965; Cornwall, 1965;\nKennel and Petschek, 1966). Recently, however, evidence\nhas been emerging that supports an alternative view to this\nmodel. There are ground-based observations (Plyasova-\nBakounina et al., 1996) and combined ground-satellite obser-\nvations (e.g. Mursula et al., 1997, 1999, 2001; Rasinkangas\nand Mursula, 1998) supporting Pc1 growth by long period\nULF waves. These papers refer to observations of EMIC\nwaves occurring at high latitudes. In each case, the repeti-\ntion rate of the Pc1 wave packets correlated with the periods\nof ULF waves in the Pc3-5 frequency range was detected si-\nmultaneously in space and on the ground. This is in strong\ncontrast to the BWP model, which dictates that the repeti-\ntion period of the Pc1 wave packets equates to their bounce\nperiod along the local field line.\nAlthough the relationship between Pc1 activity and spec-\ntral width has been applied to cusp observations, this pa-\nper will show that a similar phenomenon occurs at lower\nlatitudes in high resolution observations of naturally occur-\nring ULF waves, utilising the artificial backscatter technique.\nSpecifically, increases in spectral width have been detected in\nassociation with particle-driven Pc4 waves (possessing peri-\nods in the range 45\u2013150 s). These observations indicate that\nat L\u223c6 \u2212 7, the Pc1 and Pc4 waves have a common energy\nsource in non-Maxwellian plasma distributions in the Earth\u2019s\nring current.\nD. M.

Scans of CUTLASS Finland\nbackscatter power indicating the effect\nof activating the heater. A large patch\nof artificial backscatter is generated in\nthe radar\u2019s field of view above Troms\u00f8\nwhich would not otherwise have been\npresent. Backscatter powers often ex-\nceed 30 dB above the noise. The loca-\ntion of the Kilpisja\u00a8rvi pulsation magne-\ntometer (KIL) is also shown.\n2 Instrumentation\n2.1 The CUTLASS radars\nThe global SuperDARN network (Greenwald et al., 1995)\ncurrently consists of 15 HF coherent radars, 9 of which oper-\nate in the Northern Hemisphere. The ionospheric convection\nvelocities presented in this paper were measured by the CUT-\nLASS bistatic HF radar (Milan et al., 1997). It is a frequency\nagile system which operates in the range 8\u201320 MHz and con-\nsists of stations at Pykkvib\u00e6r, Iceland and Hankasalmi, Fin-\nland (Fig. 1). The signals returned to the radars have under-\ngone a Bragg-like backscattering process from field-aligned\nelectron density irregularities in the ionosphere. There is an\naspect angle dependence for scattering, which requires that\nthe radio wave k vector is close to orthogonal to the mag-\nnetic field. The current experiment utilises the EISCAT high\npower HF Heating facility (see below) at Troms\u00f8, which can\ngenerate artificial field-aligned irregularities and thus pro-\nvide a region of backscatter in the CUTLASS fields of view\n(e.g. Robinson et al., 1997) when backscatter may not al-\nready be present. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 2, which\nshows the portion of the CUTLASS field of view affected\nby the Troms\u00f8 heater, superimposed on a map of northern\nScandinavia. The technique thus provides a powerful way of\ndiagnosing plasma dynamics and, as in this case, observing\ngeophysical phenomena, such as ULF wave activity. In the\nOUCH mode, the CUTLASS radars do not sound on all of\ntheir 16 beams. Typically, the Finland radar makes measure-\nments on only 6 of its 15 beams (2\u20137), dwelling on each for\n1 s, and Iceland operates on beams 13\u201315 with a dwell time\nof 2 s. Thus, data are available from any given beam with\na 6-s resolution. The high backscatter powers produced us-\ning the Heater make it possible to integrate data over such\nshort dwell times, since the signal to noise levels are high.\nThe OUCH mode also utilises a range cell length of 15 km,\nshorter than the 45 km gates employed in common mode op-\nerations. The Finland and Iceland radars have lags to a first\nrange of 480 km and 1470 km, respectively, in the OUCH\nmode. In this paper only data from the northward directed\nbeam 5 of the Finland radar have been employed, as this\nbeam overlays Troms\u00f8, the location of the EISCAT Heater.\nThe fields of view of the CUTLASS radars shown in Fig. 1\nrepresent those during common mode operations. Beam 5 in\nOUCH mode is shown as the black region centred approxi-\nmately over Troms\u00f8.\n2.2 The EISCAT high power heating facility\nThe high power HF heating facility located near Troms\u00f8\ntransmits up to 1 MW of power with an effective radiated\npower of 280 MW. It is radiated through one of three 6 \u00d7 6\nphased arrays of rhombically broadened crossed dipole an-\ntennas. Different radiated frequencies can be achieved by\nselection of an appropriate array. Currently, the Heater can\noperate in the range 4\u20138 MHz. However, all of the data pre-\nsented in this paper were measured for Heater frequencies in\nthe range 4.54\u20137.1 MHz. Harmonics of the local electron gy-\nrofrequency were not employed as Heater frequencies, since\nthis could potentially have reduced the heater\u2019s ability to gen-\nerate artificial irregularities. It has been suggested that close\nto a gyroharmonic an unmodulated heater can cause spectral\nbroadening in the ULF range, which could, in turn, broaden\nthe received HF radar spectra (Ponomarenko et al., 1999).\nEach of the 12 high power transmitters are configured to\ndrive a row of 6 of the dipole antennas. When the transmit-\nted frequency is less than the local ionospheric critical fre-\nquency (foF2), then the high power wave energy may gener-\nate field-aligned electron density striations (or irregularities)\nwhen the high power electromagnetic heater wave couples\nto upper hybrid waves in a relatively narrow altitude range\nat the so-called upper hybrid height (e.g. Robinson, 1989).\nDuring the experiments described here (designated EISCAT\nspecial programme SP-UK-OUCH), only half of the trans-\nmitters and antennas were employed. This had the advantage\nof increasing the heater beam width and, therefore, the size\nof the patch of artificial scatter detected by the CUTLASS\nradars. This maximises the observing area for geophysical\n172 D. M.

As the field fluctuates a current is\ninduced in the magnetometer coil. This has the advantage\nof being able to detect relatively rapid changes in the field\nwhich occur over intervals of the order of tenths of a second.\nSome of the data employed here were sampled at 10 Hz and\nsome at 20 Hz. Such instruments generally have a resolu-\ntion of a few picoTeslas at frequencies of a few Hertz and are\nideally suited to observing Pc1 waves. During the OUCH\nexperiments, this pulsation magnetometer was the one op-\nerating closest to the location of the heater at a distance of\nabout 90 km southeast of Troms\u00f8 (see Fig. 2).\n3 Observations\nAn important feature of the artificial backscatter technique,\nand the one most relevant to this study, is that HF radar\nbackscatter artificially generated by the heater has very nar-\nrow spectral widths associated with it. This is due to the fact\nthat the artificial irregularities are very coherent and have\na long decorrelation time in the ionosphere. Yeoman and\nWright (2001) showed a comparison between CUTLASS fit-\nted spectra for backscatter from natural and artificial irregu-\nlarities (see their Figs. 1b and c). Due to the highly coherent\nnature of heater-induced irregularities, the measured velocity\nspectra are narrow, typically having widths not greater than\n10 m s\u22121. In contrast, spectra associated with natural scatter\ngenerally have widths > 100 m s\u22121 due the reduced coher-\nence of these structures. The artificial irregularities follow\nthe convection path imposed upon them by magnetospheric\ndynamics in the same way as natural irregularities. How-\never, on occasions when small-scale-sized ULF waves are\nmodulating the flows (e.g. Wright et al., 1999a, b; Yeoman\nand Wright, 2001; Baddeley et al., 2002), increases in the\nobserved spectral width of the artificial scatter are appar-\nent. This can be seen in Fig. 3, which displays data from\nbeam 5 of the CUTLASS Finland radar from the OUCH run\nof 15 October 1998. The Range-Time-Velocity data repro-\nduced in the upper panel, as a function of radar range gate\nand time, clearly shows a brightly coloured band of scat-\nter. This represents the irregularities artificially generated by\nthe heater. Had the high power facility not been used, then\nno useful scatter would have been detected and only noise\nwould have been recorded, such as in those regions immedi-\nately above and below the region of artificial scatter in this\npanel. Within the band of scatter a lot of fine structure is\napparent, which indicates the modulation of the background\nline of sight velocity of the artificial irregularities by ULF\nwaves. The waves are perhaps more evident in the middle\npanel of Fig. 3, which offers an alternative to colour coding\nthe velocities in the form of a set of stacked time series rep-\nresenting range gates 26\u201334 of the line of sight velocity data\nin the upper panel. The data from successive range gates\nhave been offset by 150m s\u22121 in this plot. Both short pe-\nriod (\u223c100 s; most notably in the interval 13:30\u201314:00 UT)\nand long period (\u223c250 s; detected prior to 12:30 UT and\nintermittently after 14:00 UT) waves are apparent in these\ntime series. The higher frequency waves, whose amplitude\nmaximises in the interval 13:30 UT and 14:00 UT, are the\nsignatures of particle-driven ULF waves with small spatial\nscale sizes (Wright et al., 1999a, b; Yeoman and Wright,\nD.

However, in the interval \u223c12:30\u2013\n15:00 UT a range of increased spectral widths are observed,\nwhich peaks at about 200m s\u22121, (although, for clarity, the\ncolour scale has been selected such that spectral widths satu-\nrate at 50m s\u22121) coinciding with the maximum amplitude of\nthe high frequency ULF wave observed in the velocity (mid-\ndle) panel.\nAnother significant feature of this data set is that both the\nwave activity and spectral width enhancements observed us-\ning CUTLASS follow common spatial boundaries. Bands of\nwave activity are localised within (i.e. enclosed by) the re-\ngion of artificial scatter. Some of the boundaries between\nthe low spectral widths associated with heater-induced ir-\nregularities and the increased spectral widths are marked in\nthe lower panel of Fig. 3. They appear as the dashed lines\nlabelled A-E. These same boundaries have also been trans-\nposed onto the velocity time series in the middle panel of the\nsame figure. It can be seen that these boundaries also sepa-\nrate the main regions of high frequency ULF wave signatures\nfrom those with longer periods. These demarcators also in-\ndicate that the small-scale waves are, at times, confined to\na relatively narrow latitudinal region certainly less than the\nextent of the patch of artificial scatter which is \u223c 180 km\n(12\u00d715 km range gates) at its widest on this occasion. Longi-\ntudinally, the high-m wave and the coincidence of enhanced\nspectral widths extend over the whole region, of artificial\nscatter, which appeared in beams 3\u20137 of the Finland radar.\nThus, the spatial extent of the wave was at least 250 km at\nL\u223c6\u2212 7.\nFigure 4 offers an alternative way of looking at the data in\nFig. 3. In this case the two panels show line of sight velocities\n(upper panel) and spectral width (lower) stacked time series\nfor ranges 26\u201334, with the data from subsequent ranges being\narbitrarily offset. The spectral width data are colour coded\nsuch that widths greater than 5m s\u22121 appear red and below\nthat level they are blue. Data spikes were avoided by only se-\nlecting intervals where more than one consecutive measure-\nment had an enhanced spectral width. The velocity data are\ncolour coded to match the widths, i.e. the velocities are given\nthe same colour as the equivalent spectral widths at the same\nrange gate and time. The purpose of this is to highlight more\nclearly that the increased spectral widths are coincident with\nthe high frequency (\u223c 10 mHz) waves. In contrast, the long\nperiod waves (signatures of large scale waves) almost exclu-\nsively appear blue. This interval of data has been selected to\ndemonstrate this relationship since it has the largest change\nin spectral width and exhibits some of the best examples of\nsmall scale waves in the OUCH data set.\nThe ACF fitting routine, fitacf, employed by SuperDARN\nradars is an essential part of the data processing performed\non the data they collect. They fit model ACFs under a series\nof constraints to those measured by the radars. Both expo-\nnential and Gaussian fits are applied to the data, which relate\nto different decorrelation times of the observed irregularities\n(e.g. Villain et al., 1987, 1996 and references therein). In\ngeneral, if the mechanism generating or modulating the ob-\nserved irregularities has a scale size comparable to that of the\nwavelength of the diagnostic HF radio wave, then the radar\nmakes a more accurate measurement of the velocity distribu-\ntion of the irregularities. Under these conditions a Gaussian\nfit is appropriate. However, where structures with correla-\ntion lengths considerably less than the HF wave are measured\n(equivalent to a type of spatial aliasing), then Lorentzian pro-\n174 D. M.

The solid lines\nrepresent the low resolution spectrum derived from the FFT of the\nmeasured ACF and the dashed curves are Lorentzian profiles gener-\nated using the parameters calculated by the ACF fitting programme,\nfitacf.\nfiles are fit to the radar data. It is well known that the power\nspectrum of the received data is simply the Fourier transform\nof the measured ACF. However, since a common mode Su-\nperDARN ACF is made up of only 17 lags, then this leads to\na very low resolution in the power spectrum. The low resolu-\ntion of the spectra produced in this manner causes power to\n\u201cleak\u201d from the central spectral component into adjacent ve-\nlocity (equivalent to frequency) bins. Figure 5 demonstrates\nthis; Fig. 5a and b are, respectively, derived from data in the\nregions of low and high spectral width (at range 28 of beam\n5) in the CUTLASS Finland data in Fig. 3. Plotted are the\npower spectra, in velocity space, of the CUTLASS observa-\ntions, as derived by the direct FFT of the ACF. In each case\nthese would indicate a spectral width (full width at half max-\nimum) of 100\u2013200m s\u22121. Superimposed on these are spec-\ntra (dotted lines) generated from the parameters derived us-\ning fitacf. These smooth curves represent Lorentzian profiles\n(the Fourier transform of an exponential ACF fit) of the fit-\nted data. They now demonstrate the stark difference between\nthe narrow fitted spectra derived from normal heater-induced\nscatter (Fig. 5a) and the broadened fitted spectra observed\nduring the particle driven wave activity (Fig. 5b). Despite\nthe similarity between the directly transformed (low resolu-\ntion) spectra in Figs. 5a and b, the actual measured ACFs\nwere very different. The ACF associated with the spectra in\nFig. 5a hardly decays at all as a function of lag time, as com-\npared to the ACF used to derive the spectra in Fig. 5b. The\nfitacf fitting process is sensitive to this decay, which is related\nto the decorrelation time of the irregularities. This is why the\nfitted spectra look so different for the two types of scatter.\nData from the Kilpisja\u00a8rvi pulsation magnetometer (KIL)\nare presented next. Unfortunately, the data set from the\nmagnetometer for 15 October 1998 (as shown in Fig. 3)\nwas incomplete. However, data covering the OUCH run on\n26 October 1999 are reproduced in Fig. 6 to illustrate the ob-\nserved features. The figure displays the H -component (from\nthe HDZ magnetic coordinate system) dynamic power spec-\ntrum derived from the KIL data. The measurements, which\nwere sampled at 20 Hz in this case, had a sliding FFT ap-\nplied to them with a window size of 51.2 s and sequential\nFFTs were slipped by 25.6 s. All KIL data employed for this\nstudy were processed in this way. Figure 6 shows the thresh-\nold spectral information over the range 0\u20132 Hz. Most Pc1\nwaves occur in the range 0.2\u20132 Hz and so these are the limits\nwe have imposed on the data in this study. What is immedi-\nately apparent in the dynamic spectrum are the two bursts of\nenhanced spectral power which lie in a band below 1 Hz and\noccur from 07:10\u201307:40 UT and 08:00\u201308:30 UT. These are\nindicators of Pc1 wave activity.\nFigures 7 and 8 are now respectively employed to dis-\ntinguish between observations made during intervals when\nparticle-driven waves were detected from those occasions\nwhen such activity was absent. Shown in both figures are\nsimultaneous CUTLASS and KIL data. Figure 7 presents\ndata from 26 October 1999, the same interval as in Fig. 6.\nThe CUTLASS line of sight velocity and spectral width data\nin Figs. 7a\u2013c are in the same format as Fig. 3. The inter-\nval in Fig. 7 has been selected for two reasons. First, it is\nanother occasion (compare Fig. 3) on which Pc4 wave signa-\ntures were observed in the patch of artificial radar backscat-\nter. In addition, on this day KIL magnetometer data were\navailable for comparison, which was not the case for the in-\nterval shown in Fig. 3. During the interval presented in Fig. 7,\nthe region of CUTLASS backscatter was rather more patchy\nthan for that in Fig. 3, due to the prevailing ionospheric con-\nditions. The two time series in Figs. 7d and e, respectively,\nrepresent the H - and D-component total spectral power, de-\nrived from the dynamic spectral analysis, summed over the\nfrequency range 0.2\u20132 Hz. This acts as a general indicator\nof wave activity in the Pc1 frequency band. For this in-\nterval, as with that on 15 October 1998, small-scale-sized\nparticle driven waves are clearly visible modulating the line\nof sight flow of the artificial irregularities. These manifest\nthemselves as the relatively high frequency wave cycles with\nD. M.

A dynamic power spectrum de-\nrived from H -component data recorded\nby the Kilpisja\u00a8rvi pulsation magne-\ntometer (KIL) on 26 October 1999.\nBursts of Pc1 activity are apparent at\nfrequencies below 1 Hz. The data pre-\nsented here was analysed using a 51.2 s\nspectral window with a slip of 25.6 s.\nperiods in the range 60\u201370 s. Baddeley et al. (2002) have pre-\nsented a detailed investigation into the nature of the waves\nin this interval and concluded that they were the result of a\ndrift-bounce resonant interaction between drifting ring cur-\nrent protons, with energies of around 10 keV, and a field line\neigenmode. The azimuthal wave number (m) of these waves\nwas shown to be \u221245. It can again be seen that enhanced\nspectral widths appear coincident with the occurrence of the\nhigh-m waves in the velocity data. What is even more signif-\nicant though is the fact that simultaneous with these features\nin the CUTLASS data are large increases in Pc1 power de-\ntected by the KIL magnetometer.\nIn contrast, Fig. 8 displays an interval of data from\n21 October 1999 when high-m particle driven waves were\nnot present. The panels in Fig. 8 are in the same format\nas those in Fig. 7. In this case only the weak signatures of\nlonger period and large-scale-sized field line resonances are\nobserved. There are no significant increases in radar spec-\ntral width and the measured spectra maintained widths of\nless than 10m s\u22121. This time the summed KIL H - and D-\ncomponent Pc1 powers are very low and unchanging. This\nagain supports our suggestion of a relationship between Pc1\nactivity and particle driven wave occurrence.\n4 Discussion\nSince it was first run in 1998 the OUCH experiment has\nmade significant advances in ULF wave research. CUTLASS\nmeasurements taken during runs of the OUCH experiment\nhave already demonstrated that ULF wave activity is contin-\nuously ongoing but that often waves with small-scale sizes\nin the magnetosphere and ionosphere cannot be detected\non the ground, due to the relatively low spatial resolution\nof the instruments traditionally employed to observe them.\nGround magnetometers generally integrate their data over a\nregion which is of the order of the height of the E-region\n(\u223c100 km; Hughes and Southwood, 1976). Thus, small-\nscale waves of the type reported by Yeoman et al. (1997),\nWright et al. (1999a, b), Yeoman and Wright (2001), Bad-\ndeley et al. (2002), as well as in this paper are invisible to\nstandard instruments. In fact, the data measured using the ar-\ntificial backscatter technique are amongst the highest spatial\nand temporal resolution electric fields associated with ULF\nwaves ever recorded in solar-terrestrial physics. They are\nalso the most accurate ULF wave electric fields ever observed\non account of the extremely narrow spectral widths normally\nassociated with artificially induced radar backscatter. Due\nto the bistatic nature of CUTLASS, polarisation hodograms\ncan also be derived for the ULF waves. Wright et al. (1999b)\nalso examined the polarisations of waves measured with this\ntechnique and demonstrated that they exhibit similar charac-\nteristics to the VHF radar observations of such high-m waves\nreported by Allan et al. (1982).\nFrom examination of the CUTLASS and KIL data pre-\nsented here, it seems clear that a relationship exists between\nthe occurrence of the particle-driven Pc4 waves apparent in\nCUTLASS velocity data and increases in Pc1 activity de-\ntected on the ground. The nature of this relationship will\nbe explored below.\n4.1 Ion-cyclotron wave generation\nThis paper is concerned with two types of ion cyclotron\nwaves: electrostatic ion cyclotron (ESIC) waves and electro-\nmagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves. Both can be gener-\nated by wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere. At\nL \u2248 6 energy exchange can occur from the drifting protons\n(along with He+ and heavier ions), which constitute the ring\ncurrent if they possess a non-maxwellian energy distribution.\nFor example, it is known that such wave activity is enhanced\nin the recovery phase after geomagnetic storms and sub-\nstorms. For over 30 years the generally accepted generation\nmechanism for these waves was the Bouncing Wave Packet\n(BWP) model (Obayashi, 1965; Cornwall, 1965; Kennel and\nPetschek, 1966). In this scenario, ion cyclotron wave modes\n176 D. M.

Inside the plasmasphere, protons with\nenergies of several hundred keV are believed to be responsi-\nble for the generation of these waves. Beyond the plasma-\npause however, at L \u2248 6 proton energies of \u223c 10 keV can\nresonate with the ion cyclotron wave modes (e.g. Cornwall,\n1965; Thorne, 1972).\nESIC waves are most commonly polarised with k\u22a5 \u001d k\u2016.\nIn contrast to the EMIC waves, which propagate, in gen-\neral, parallel to the magnetic field, ESIC waves occur pre-\ndominantly in the equatorial plane around the source region.\nHowever, some ESIC waves can propagate along the field in\nthe slow magnetosonic mode. EMIC waves are restricted to\nfrequencies, with a narrow-band spectrum, below the local\nion cyclotron frequency, \u03c9c, whereas ESIC waves are gen-\nerally separated into narrow-and broad-band spectral types.\nNarrow-band ESIC waves typically exhibit frequencies just\nabove the proton cyclotron frequency and its harmonics (e.g.\nThorne, 1983; Gurnett, 1991). Broad-band ESIC waves (of-\nten called broad-band electrostatic noise) exhibit frequencies\nranging from a few Hz to tens of kHz and have long been\nknown to occur in the auroral regions, although their origins\nare still not fully understood. The estimated carrier frequency\nof the waves, \u03c9, is given by \u03c9 \u223c \u03c9c(VA\/v), where VA is the\nAlfve\u00b4n velocity and v is the velocity of the resonant protons.\nIn general, electrostatic waves dominate at higher latitudes\n(outside the plasmapause), and these are considered to be re-\nD.

These\npapers refer to observations of EMIC waves occurring at\nhigh latitudes. In each case, the repetition rate of the Pc1\nwave packets correlated with the periods of ULF waves in\nthe Pc3-5 frequency range detected simultaneously in space\nand on the ground. This is in strong contrast to the BWP\nmodel, which dictates that the repetition period of the Pc1\nwave packets equates to their bounce period along the local\nfield line. These authors have suggested that the long-period\nULF waves modulate the plasma parameters, in particular,\nthe plasma density, in the equatorial growth region of the\nEMIC waves. This supports the model of cyclotron wave\ngrowth by Gail (1990), which indicates that even small rel-\native variations in critical plasma parameters could modify\nthe rate of EMIC wave growth close to marginal instability\nby periodically forcing the plasma into an unstable state in\nterms of the ion cyclotron instability. Mursula et al. (2001)\n178 D. M. Wright et al.: Spectral width features associated with ULF wave signatures in artificial HF radar backscatter\nalso noted that the latitudinal extent of the EMIC waves was\nessentially the same as that for the long-period ULF waves,\nboth of which, in their case study, were restricted to about\n1\u25e6 of latitude. The BWP model has been discounted by these\nauthors for the events they describe, since the combination of\nthe calculated group velocity for the observed wave packets\nand the repetition period of the Pc1 bursts cannot be recon-\nciled within the model.\n4.2 HF radar spectral widths\nThe measured spectral widths associated with HF radar ob-\nservations are known to exhibit characteristics related to the\nionospheric irregularities being diagnosed and to the mech-\nanism responsible for creating them. The spectral width of\na backscattered signal can, for example, permit the distinc-\ntion between various types of irregularities (e.g. Haldoupis,\n1989; Milan and Lester, 2001). Pinnock et al. (1995) has\nshown that HF radar spectral widths provide a useful way\nof identifying the location of the ionospheric signature of\nthe magnetospheric cusp. The spectral widths associated\nwith cusp scatter are generally high and variable, and are\naccompanied by variable line of sight velocities. Baker et\nal. (1995) also reported that these high spectral widths are\nin reality multicomponent spectra which are not resolved by\nthe fitacf routine. They suggested that the multicomponent\nspectra were caused by highly variable and turbulent electric\nfields. Such fields have been identified in the cusp in satellite\ndata in association with strong particle precipitation (Baker et\nal., 1990). It has also been suggested that the observed cusp\nspectra may relate to strong variations that have a discrete\nnature (Hanuise et al., 1991). That implies that the observed\nspectra could be due to spatial structures, such as velocity\nshears, with scale sizes less than the size of the radar range\ncell. Small-scale vortical structures generated by filamentary\nfield-aligned currents (FACs) have also been hypothesised as\na potential mechanism for producing multiple velocity com-\nponents inside a radar range cell (Andre\u00b4 et al., 2000a). In this\ncase the vortex would be maintained by a current, the result\nof a diverging electric field at the bottom of the field-aligned\ncomponents of the FAC. Under these conditions, the irreg-\nularities required for radar backscatter may be generated by\nthe current convective instability (Ossakow and Chaturvedi,\n1979).\nFast temporal changes inside a radar range cell can also\ncause high spectral widths. This is a result of aliasing, where\na structure is changing faster than can be sampled by the\nradar. Currently, SuperDARN radars have a pulse repetition\nrate of approximately 0.1 s, and these data generally are inte-\ngrated up to at least 1 s. With this in mind Andre\u00b4 et al. (1999,\n2000a, b) modelled the possible causes of the high spectral\nwidths observed in the cusp. They compared simulations of\nmicro-scale turbulence, velocity shears due to, for example,\nsmall-scale vortices and high frequency Pc1 wave activity.\nThey concluded that although any of the mechanisms could\nresult in increased spectral widths, only Pc1 wave activity\nwould be able to generate the very high spectral widths (typ-\nically > 350m s\u22121) observed in the cusp. They also found\ntheir modelling results to be consistent with spacecraft and\nground magnetometer observations of wave activity inside\nthe cusp. The modelling indicated that although a threshold\nwave amplitude, which is frequency dependent (see Plate 1\nof Andre\u00b4 et al., 1999), must be exceeded to affect the radar\ndata, this threshold was much lower than the wave ampli-\ntudes observed by spacecraft. However, Ponomarenko and\nWaters (2002) have identified a potential weakness in the\nmodelling code employed by Andre\u00b4 et al. (1999). Pono-\nmarenko and Waters (2002) state that the time-independent\nvelocity utilised in the model causes a nonlinear growth of\nthe wave amplitude with time. This leads to the large spec-\ntral widths associated with the model results. By assuming a\ntime-dependent (e.g. a sinusoidal) velocity variation associ-\nated with the ion-cyclotron waves, an upper limit of around\n100m s\u22121 is imposed on the observed radar spectral widths.\nThis implies that the high spectral widths (> 350m s\u22121) as-\nsociated with cusp scatter are not related to Pc1 wave activity.\nInstead, Ponomarenko and Waters (2002) suggest that short\nscale spatio-temporal structures, caused by particle precipi-\ntation inside a radar range cell, are more likely to produce\nthe observed effects. However, both phenomena remain pos-\nsible candidates for the observations presented in this paper,\nsince the spectral widths enhancements reported here do not\nexceed 100m s\u22121.\n4.3 The OUCH experiments\nData from three OUCH experimental campaigns occurring\nin the interval 1998-9, representing approximately 50 h of ex-\nperiments, have been employed in this study. Examination of\nthese data clearly indicates numerous intervals when high-m\nparticle-driven waves in the Pc4-5 frequency range are de-\ntected by the CUTLASS radars in the ionosphere, while op-\nerating in a high spatial and temporal resolution mode. In-\ncreases in the radar spectral width parameter and Pc1 (ion-\ncyclotron) wave power measured at the ground are also si-\nmultaneously observed. These features are coincident in\ntime, as is apparent in Figs. 3 and 7. In addition, there is\na correlation between the region of increased spectral width\nand Pc4 wave modulation of the flows inside the heated re-\ngion. In the same sense as common spatial boundaries have\nbeen identified in the data, marked A-E in Fig. 3, such bound-\naries are also evident in Fig. 7. For example, both effects\nare restricted to the lower half of the region of artificial scat-\nter from 07:15\u201307:40 UT. This relationship is commonly ob-\nserved throughout the OUCH data set. A comparison of Pc1\nspectral power measured on the ground in Kilpisja\u00a8rvi as a\nfunction of the spectral widths of CUTLASS Finland data\nduring OUCH experiments is reproduced in Fig. 9. All use-\nful data from 1998-9 have been employed in the plot \u2013 that\nis to say all data where both KIL and CUTLASS measure-\nments exist.

These\npoints have been colour coded such that known CUTLASS\ndata intervals where there is no particle-driven wave activ-\nity are coloured blue, and red points represent obvious inter-\nvals when high-m waves were observed in CUTLASS line\nof sight velocities. For the most part the \u201cquiet time\u201d data\n(blue) are clustered around the low Pc1 power-low widths\u2019\npart of the plot. The \u201cactive\u201d data (red), on the other hand,\nare not confined to this region of the plot and are spread such\nthat there are more points at higher spectral widths and Pc1\npowers. However, the broader picture, provided by the total\ndata set shown in Fig. 9, is clearly more randomly spread.\nFigure 9, therefore, does not provide a clear case in support\nof the hypothesis that increased spectral widths generally oc-\ncur when there are also enhancements in Pc1 wave activity.\nThere are a number of possible explanations that a defini-\ntive relationship is not apparent. It is likely that some of the\nradar observations may be contaminated not only by other\nunrelated phenomena which increase the spectral width, but\nalso by noise. In addition, the pulsation magnetometer is not\nideally located for this study. Its position, some 90 km south-\neast of Troms\u00f8 and right at the edge of the ground projected\nheated region (see Fig. 2), suggests that it might not detect\nall Pc1 waves even if they did occur simultaneously with\nPc4 activity detected by the radar inside the region of artifi-\ncial irregularities. The location of KIL could be particularly\ndetrimental for intervals of Pc4 wave activity localised to the\npoleward edge of the patch of artificial CUTLASS backscat-\nter (e.g. 12:20\u201312:45 UT on 15 October 1998; see Fig. 3).\nPc1 waves are also known to duct away from their source\nregions inside ionospheric waves guides (Duong and Fraser,\n1976; Altman and Fijalkow, 1980; Fraser et al., 1989) and\nso the Pc1 energy may never actually reach the ground at\nKilpisja\u00a8rvi. In an attempt to resolve this issue, another pul-\nsation magnetometer has recently been deployed in Troms\u00f8\nfor use in future experiments. Data from this instrument will\nbe the subject of a future paper.\nMursula et al. (1999, 2001) reported a Pc1 \u201cpearl\u201d event\n(a structured Pc1 wave appearing as repetitive bursts of wave\nenergy) which occurred simultaneously with Pc4 wave ac-\ntivity. The Pc1 burst repetition period closely matched the\nPc4 wave period. Examination of electric and magnetic field\nand plasma data from the Polar spacecraft indicated that the\nPc1 source region was localised to about 1\u25e6 of latitude in the\nvicinity of the plasmapause. This was supported by observa-\ntions from pulsation magnetometers on the ground, includ-\ning KIL. They suggested that the narrowness of the region\nover which Pc1s were observed may have been the result of\neither a narrow wave source region or the waves remaining\nrelatively field guided as they propagate towards the Earth.\nThe latter would require the existence of appropriate plasma\ngradients. Simultaneously, the IMAGE network of magne-\ntometers detected a Pc4 event, the latitudinal amplitude pro-\nfile of which indicated a similarly narrow source region at\nabout the same latitude. The Pc4 wave contained a mixture\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nP\no\nw\ne\nr \n(x\n1\n0-4\n)\n 1030 points\nSpectral Width (m s-1)\nSUPERDARN PARAMETER PLOT\nHankasalmi: Spectral Width vs Summed H+D Pc1 Power\nFigure 9\nFig. 9. A comparison of summed H -and D-component Pc1 power\nmeasured by KIL and the mean spectral width measured by CUT-\nLASS across the region of artificial scatter observed along beam\n5 of the Finland radar. The total data set (black pluses) were de-\nrived from all OUCH experiments in the years 1998\u20139 and rep-\nresent 1-min averaged values (1030 points in total) on all occa-\nsions when data were available. Also highlighted are the data com-\npiled from Figs. 3, 7 and 8 when the spectral widths were very low\n(blue pluses) and increased coincident with Pc4 wave activity (red\npluses).\nof toroidal and poloidal modes. The findings of these au-\nthors are in agreement with those presented here. The radar\ndata clearly show Pc4 signatures and spectral width features\nwhich are of the order of 1\u25e6 of latitude or less (Fig. 3). This\nlocalisation would also be expected to affect the KIL mea-\nsurements, as discussed earlier.\nAlthough the papers by Mursula et al. (1999, 2001) de-\nscribe observations of EMIC waves around the plasma-\npause, the ULF wave model of EMIC wave modulation has\nalso been applied to high latitude observations (Plyasova-\nBakounina et al., 1996). It is believed that the longer period\nULF waves modulate the plasma parameters in the magne-\ntosphere, and this is the key to coupling the two-wave types.\nIn particular, there is evidence which indicates that it is the\noscillation of the plasma density which is principally impor-\ntant. Mursula et al. (2001) state that plasma density varia-\ntions at the ULF wave frequency were also detected by Polar\nduring their event. These authors suggest that an E \u00d7 B\ndrift driven by the azimuthal component of the electric field\nis likely to cause radial plasma density variations. Gradi-\nents in plasma density are also known to be important in Pc1\npropagation, which is why they are reported to occur most\ncommonly around the plasmapause.\nRecent studies of particle-driven ULF waves (Wright et\nal., 2001; Yeoman and Wright, 2001; Baddeley et al., 2002)\nhave demonstrated that the types of Pc4 waves observed by\nthe artificial backscatter technique (see Figs. 3 and 7) are\nthe result of a drift-bounce resonant interaction between the\ndrifting energetic protons, which constitute part of the ring\ncurrent, and suitable field line eigenmodes or one of their\n180 D. M. Wright et al.: Spectral width features associated with ULF wave signatures in artificial HF radar backscatter\nharmonics. In such cases the drifting plasma must exhibit a\nnon-Maxwellian ion energy distribution, in order to provide\nthe free energy for wave growth. Such unstable ion distri-\nbution functions occur commonly in the collisionless plasma\nof the ring current. For all of the events reported by these\nauthors, it has been demonstrated that protons with energies\naround 10 keV were involved in the resonant interactions. It\nis not unreasonable to suggest, therefore, that those same par-\nticles are also the energy source for the Pc1 waves. It is al-\nready well known that such particle energies are responsible\nfor Pc1 generation beyond the plasmapause at L \u2248 6 (e.g.\nCornwall, 1965; Thorne, 1972).\n5 Summary\nThe data presented in this paper indicate a link between the\nobserved occurrence of drift-bounce resonant Pc4 waves and\nrelatively high frequency Pc1 waves at high latitudes. This\nstudy has identified the following points to support this:\n1. Increased spectral widths frequently coincide with ob-\nservations of particle-driven Pc4 waves.\n2. The regions of Pc4 activity and enhanced spectral\nwidths share common spatial boundaries.\n3. Simultaneous enhancements in Pc1 power are detected\non the ground, by magnetometers, during the observed\nPc4 events.\n4. Both Pc1 waves detected in space and on the ground,\nand the Pc4 waves observed in the OUCH experiments\nare spatially localised, sometimes to 1\u25e6 of latitude.\n5. Modelling results demonstrate that Pc1 waves are a\npotential candidate for causing high HF radar spectral\nwidths at high latitudes.\n6. The energies of drifting ring current protons required to\ngenerate both Pc1s and Pc4s at high latitudes are the\nsame.\n7. Recent modelling work suggests that Pc4 waves may\nalso be intimately involved in the generation of Pc1\nbursts.\nIt seems likely that the events presented in the current pa-\nper are best described by the action of long-period (Pc4\/5)\nULF waves on the ion-cyclotron wave source region in the\nmagnetosphere, and that the current observations are related\nto those reported by Plyasova-Bakounina et al. (1996), Mur-\nsula et al. (1997, 1999, 2001) and Rasinkangas and Mur-\nsula (1998). This study presents multiple occurrences of Pc4\nwaves driven by wave-particle interactions in the magneto-\nsphere, simultaneously with broadened spectral widths and\nincreases in Pc1 activity.\nIn accordance with the modelling work of Andre\u00b4 et\nal. (1999, 2000a, b) and Ponomarenko and Waters (2002), the\nmost likely explanation for the spectral width observations\nduring the Pc4 events presented here is that Pc1 waves, in\nthe form of both broad-band ESIC and narrower-band EMIC\nwaves, are responsible for increasing the spectral width of\nthe radar returns. This is a result of temporal aliasing effects\ncaused by the Pc1 activity inside the relatively long sample\nperiod of the radar range cells. The magnetospheric cusp\nregion, which is an area of intensive research at present, is\noften identified by its large and variable spectral widths, as\nobserved by coherent HF radars. It is commonly believed\nthat this is the result of Pc1 waves (mainly broad-band ESIC\nnoise) inside the magnetospheric cusp. However, Pono-\nmarenko and Waters (2002) indicate that spatio-temporal ef-\nfects relating to particle precipitation localised inside a radar\nrange cell could also cause the observed increases in spectral\nwidth. If the source mechanism for wave activity inside the\ncusp is similar to that for Pc1s observed at lower latitudes,\nthen experiments such as the one described here, which ap-\nply the artificial backscatter technique, could be invaluable to\nthe investigation of cusp-type phenomena. This study would\nseem to support the hypothesis that Pc1 waves play an active\nrole in increasing HF radar spectral widths, since such wave\nactivity is detected simultaneously on the ground. However,\nspatial effects inside the radar range cells may also be im-\nportant. The deployment of a new high power HF facility\ncalled SPEAR (Space Plasma Exploration by Active Radar;\nWright et al., 2000) on Svalbard, which will spend a signif-\nicant amount of its time underneath the cusp, will hopefully\noffer an opportunity to employ this technique directly and\nanswer some of the long-standing questions about the cusp.\nAcknowledgements.
