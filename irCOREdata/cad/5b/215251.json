Mentoring is \none initiative that has been suggested as a means of reducing the high costs associated \nwith employee turnover.  However, prior accounting research examining the association \nbetween mentoring and turnover intentions has produced mixed results, which may be \ndue, at least in part, to difficulties in operationalizing the mentoring construct. Drawing \non recent management literature regarding organizational turnover intentions, we \nchallenge the conventional view that mentoring generally leads to reduced turnover \nintentions, by testing a theoretical model that posits that different functions of mentoring \nhave differing effects on turnover intentions.  Specifically, we argue that while the \npsychosocial support function of mentoring can serve to reduce public accountants\u2019 \nturnover intentions, the career development function of mentoring has the potential to \nincrease turnover intentions.  Results support this conclusion. \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \nIn recent years there has been considerable interest surrounding the development, \noperation and effects of mentoring relationships within public accounting firms (see, for \nexample, Viator & Pasewark, 2005; Herbohn, 2004; Kaplan, Keinath & Walo, 2001). A \nmentoring relationship is an interpersonal exchange between a senior experienced \ncolleague (the mentor) and a less-experienced junior colleague (the prot\u00e9g\u00e9) in which the \nmentor provides direction, support and feedback to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 regarding career plans and \npersonal development (Russell & Adams, 1997; Kram, 1985). One of the strongest claims \nregarding mentoring relationships is that they assist public accounting firms in retaining \nemployees (AICPA, 2007; Gregg, 1999). However, despite numerous studies, it is \nunclear whether and how mentoring relationships affect public accountants\u2019 \norganizational turnover intentions.1 Simply having a mentor does not necessarily result in \nlower turnover intentions; some studies find a negative association between having a \nmentor and intentions to leave the accounting firm (Viator & Scandura, 1991; Scandura \n& Viator, 1994; Barker, Monks & Buckley, 1999), whereas others report no \nassociation (Viator, 2001; Herbohn, 2004). Studies focusing on the support provided by a \nmentor to a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 also report mixed results. Some research finds that more career \ndevelopment and psychosocial support from a mentor is associated with lower turnover \nintentions (Herbohn, 2004; Barker et al., 1999), but other studies find no \n                                                 \n1 Given the difficulties associated with obtaining data on actual turnover behaviour, we focus our analysis \non organizational turnover intentions. Prior research shows that turnover intention is a valid and reliable \nindicator of subsequent turnover behaviour (Steel & Ovalle, 1984). \n 4 \nassociations (Viator & Scandura, 1994).2 We propose several explanations for these \nmixed findings.   \n Most prior research has focused on differences in turnover intentions between \nthose public accountants who have a mentor and those who do not (for example, Viator & \nScandura, 1991; Barker et al., 1999). Operationalizing mentoring as a dichotomous \n(yes\/no) variable is problematic because it potentially masks the effects of mentoring \nrelationships by combining good and poor quality mentoring in one category (Ragins, \nCotton & Miller, 2000). We argue that it is not the presence or absence of a mentor that is \nimportant; rather, it is the quality of a mentoring relationship that is likely to affect an \nindividual\u2019s turnover intentions (Allen et al., 2004; Ragins et al., 2000).  \nA mentor can provide two different types of support: career development support \nand psychosocial support (Kram, 1985).3 Prior research on mentoring has argued that \nboth career development support and psychosocial support are negatively associated with \nintentions to leave the accounting firm (Scandura & Viator, 1994; Barker et al., 1999; \nHerbohn, 2004). However, theory indicates that the two types of mentoring support can \nhave different effects because they relate to different facets of the mentoring \nrelationship (Allen et al., 2004; Kram, 1985; Tharenou, 2005). Career development \nsupport is primarily concerned with preparing the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 for career advancement, such \nas providing assistance with learning the job and sponsoring the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 for important \nassignments (Viator, 2001; Allen et al., 2004; Kram, 1985). In contrast, psychosocial \nsupport primarily relates to developing the prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s identity and sense of self, such as \n                                                 \n2 A summary table of findings from prior studies of mentoring and organizational turnover in accounting \nfirms appears in the Appendix. \n3 In their meta-analysis of mentoring research, Allen et al. (2004) argue that the career and psychosocial \nfunctions serve as the primary distinct and reliable overarching operationalizations of mentoring support. \nFollowing Allen et al. (2004), we focus our analysis on these two primary functions of mentoring. \n 5 \nsharing of personal experiences, acts of friendship, and acting as a role model (Viator, \n2001; Allen et al., 2004; Kram, 1985). As such, it is questionable whether both types of \nmentor support would have the same effect on public accountants\u2019 organizational \nturnover intentions.   \nPrior research has focused almost exclusively on the direct effect of mentoring \nrelationships on organizational turnover intentions, rather than indirect effects. There can \nbe theoretical differences between direct- and indirect-effects models that have practical \nimplications (Shields, Deng & Kato, 2000; Hall, 2008). In particular, mentor support may \nserve to both increase and decrease turnover intentions through its effect on intervening \npsychological mechanisms, yet these conflicting effects are not examined in direct-effect \nmodels, potentially resulting in inconsistent results (Luft & Shields, 2007: 45). Indirect-\neffects models also allow an investigation into how and why a relationship between \nmentoring and organizational turnover intentions may exist (Payne & Huffman, 2005; \nLankau & Scandura, 2002).  \nWe test a theoretical model linking the two types of support provided by a \nmentor (career development and psychosocial support) to organizational turnover \nintentions through three intervening variables: psychological empowerment, affective \norganizational commitment, and procedural justice. Collectively, these three variables \nhelp to explain how and why mentor support is related to organizational turnover \nintentions. In contrast to prior research, but consistent with theory, we find that career \ndevelopment support is positively associated with intentions to leave the accounting firm \nboth directly and indirectly through the intervening variable of psychological \nempowerment. We find that psychosocial support is negatively associated with public \n 6 \naccountants\u2019 intentions to leave the accounting firm through the intervening variables of \naffective organizational commitment and procedural justice. Our study contributes to the \nliterature by showing that the mere presence\/absence of a mentor does not affect \norganizational turnover intentions; rather, it is the nature of the support provided by a \nmentor that is important. Most interestingly, we show that career development support \nand psychosocial support have different effects on public accountants\u2019 organizational \nturnover intentions.  In particular, we show that more career development support can \nincrease a prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s turnover intentions. From a practical perspective, this has important \nimplications for the efficacy of accounting firms\u2019 mentoring programs insofar as they are \naimed at reducing employee turnover. From a theoretical perspective, our results indicate \nthat researchers need to consider how each type of mentor support is related to the \noutcome(s) of interest, rather than assuming different types will have the same effects. \nThrough including three intervening variables in our theoretical model, we increase \nunderstanding of the psychological mechanisms through which mentoring relationships \naffect public accountants\u2019 intentions to leave an accounting firm.  \nThe remainder of the paper contains four sections. The next section develops the \ntheoretical model and presents hypotheses. The research method, including sample \nselection and variable measurement, is then presented. This is followed by presentation of \nthe results. The final section discusses the results and concludes the paper. \n \nTheoretical Framework \nBased on our discussion, we expect career development support to increase \nturnover intentions and psychosocial support to reduce turnover intentions. To test this, \n 7 \nwe develop a model linking psychosocial support and career development support to \norganizational turnover intentions through three intervening variables: affective \norganizational commitment, procedural justice and psychological empowerment.4 We \npropose that career development support is positively associated with psychological \nempowerment (H1), which, in turn, is positively associated with organizational turnover \nintentions (H2). In contrast, we expect that psychosocial support is positively associated \nwith both affective organizational commitment and procedural justice (H3, H4), which, in \nturn, are both negatively associated with organizational turnover intentions (H5, H6).   \n \nCareer development support and psychological empowerment \nPsychological empowerment refers to intrinsic task motivation manifested in a set \nof four cognitions: meaning (the value placed on work judged in relation to an \nindividual\u2019s own ideals or standards), competence (an individual\u2019s belief in his\/her \ncapacity to perform a job with skill), self-determination (an individual\u2019s belief concerning \nthe degree of choice he\/she has in initiating and performing work behaviours), and impact \n(the extent to which an individual believes he\/she can influence outcomes at work) \n(Spreitzer, 1995; Thomas & Velthouse, 1990). Career development support involves the \nmentor sponsoring the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 for assignments that increase contact with important \nclients, partners and managers, increasing a prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s opportunities for information \nexchange and knowledge acquisition unavailable through usual channels (Allen et al. \n                                                 \n4 We include affective organizational commitment and procedural justice in our theoretical model as prior \nresearch shows that these two variables are important outcomes of mentor support (Siegel, Reinstein & \nMiller, 2001; Stallworth, 2003; Scandura, 1997). In addition, both affective organizational commitment and \nprocedural justice have been found to be important predictors of organizational turnover intentions (see, for \nexample, Ketchand & Strawser, 1998; Fogarty & Kalbers, 2006; Konovsky & Cropanzano, 1991). We \ninclude psychological empowerment in our model to test our expectation that some forms of mentor \nsupport are likely to enhance prot\u00e9g\u00e9s\u2019 beliefs in their ability to secure valued employment at other firms, \nwhich can lead to higher turnover intentions. \n 8 \n2004). Social exchanges with important individuals within and outside the firm can \nincrease a prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s sense of power and mastery, thus developing beliefs related to self-\ndetermination, impact and competence (Spreitzer, 1996). Furthermore, greater contact \nwith key clients and partners\/managers is likely to be intrinsically rewarding, \nstrengthening a prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s sense of meaning and purpose. Career development support \nalso involves the mentor helping the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to learn new skills and to develop expertise, \nwhich is likely to enhance a prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s belief in their own competence, and to influence \noutcomes in his\/her work role. Furthermore, work roles that develop new skills and \nabilities are viewed as more meaningful than those roles that do not develop such skills \nand abilities (Thomas & Velthouse, 1990; Hackman & Oldham, 1980). Hence: \nH1: There is a positive association between career development support and \npsychological empowerment. \n \nPsychological empowerment and organizational turnover intentions \nMaertz and Griffeth (2004) argue that one driver of turnover behaviour is an \n\u2018alternative force\u2019 related to an individual\u2019s belief in his\/her ability to secure a valued \nalternative position in another firm. Public accountants with high levels of psychological \nempowerment have strong belief in their own ability, competence and influence, and thus \nare more likely to believe that they will be able to obtain valued alternative employment \nin other firms.  Importantly, such beliefs can be based not only on knowledge of specific \npositions and job offers, but on perceptions of the job market and the types of positions \navailable in other firms (Maertz & Griffeth, 2004). In contrast, individuals with low \npsychological empowerment are unlikely to believe that they have the necessary skills, \ncompetence or influence to obtain valued alternative employment in other firms (Benson, \nFinegold, & Mohrman; 2004). Finally, psychological empowerment reflects an active, \n 9 \nrather than passive, orientation to one\u2019s work role (Spreitzer, 1995). As such, employees \nwho have high levels of psychological empowerment are likely to be more active in \nsearching for, and have more opportunities to learn about, options for alternative \nemployment in other firms. This leads to H2: \nH2: There is a positive association between psychological empowerment and \norganizational turnover intentions. \n \nPsychosocial support, affective organizational commitment and procedural justice \nAffective organizational commitment refers to an individual\u2019s emotional \nattachment to an organization and develops when an individual becomes involved in, \nrecognizes the value relevance of, and\/or derives his\/her identity from the \norganization (Meyer & Herscovitch, 2001; Ketchand & Strawser, 2001; Meyer & Allen, \n1997). Psychosocial support, through the provision of friendship, counselling, and role \nmodelling, develops emotional bonds and promotes the adoption of organizational values \nby prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, thus facilitating identification with the organization (Payne & Huffman, \n2005; Joiner, Bartram & Garreffa, 2004; Stallworth, 2003; Eisenberger, Huntington, \nHutchison, & Sowa, 1986).  In contrast, a lack of psychosocial support from a mentor is \nlikely to limit the extent to which a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 identifies with the organization. Siegel et \nal. (2001) found that two aspects of psychosocial support, social support and role \nmodelling, were positively associated with affective organizational commitment.  \nProcedural justice refers to the perceived fairness of the mechanisms and \nprocesses by which decisions in the organization are made (Greenberg, 1990; Parker & \nKohlmeyer, 2005). Psychosocial support is expected to develop higher levels of \nprocedural justice by enhancing prot\u00e9g\u00e9s\u2019 perceptions of the fairness of organizational \nprocesses and procedures as it involves the mentor discussing concerns, talking about \n 10 \nproblems, and showing empathy for and feelings of respect toward the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (Kram, \n1985; Viator, 2001; Allen et al., 2004). In contrast, where mentors fail to discuss \nconcerns with and show respect for the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, this is likely to reduce a prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s belief \nin the fairness of organizational procedures. Prior research shows a positive association \nbetween psychosocial support and procedural justice (Siegel et al., 2001; Scandura, \n1997).  The above discussion leads to H3 and H4: \nH3: There is a positive association between psychosocial support and affective \norganizational commitment. \n \nH4: There is a positive association between psychosocial support and procedural justice. \n \nAffective organizational commitment, procedural justice and organizational turnover \nintentions \nAn employee who is attached to, and enjoys his\/her membership of, an \norganization is motivated to continue that experience by maintaining his\/her membership \n(Meyer & Allen, 1997). In contrast, employees who do not enjoy their membership will \nseek to avoid discomfort by withdrawing their membership (Maertz & Griffeth, 2004). \nMany prior studies show that affective organizational commitment is negatively \nassociated with organizational turnover intentions (Ketchand & Strawser, 1998; Mathieu \n& Zajac, 1990; Meyer & Herscovitch, 2001; Fogarty & Kalbers, 2006). \nWhen an employee perceives that the organization has failed in one or more of its \nobligations, this reduces or negates any felt obligations owed to the organization, \nincluding obligations to stay (Maertz & Griffeth, 2004). In particular, individuals who \nperceive bias or unjust treatment are motivated to pursue employment in other \u2018fairer\u2019 \norganizations (Parker & Kohlmeyer, 2005).  Several studies have found a negative \nrelationship between procedural justice and organizational turnover intentions (e.g., \n 11 \nAryee, Budhwar & Zhen, 2002; Dailey & Kirk, 1992; Konovsky & Cropanzano, 1991).  \nThis leads to H5 and H6: \nH5: There is a negative association between affective organizational commitment and \norganizational turnover intentions. \n \nH6: There is a negative association between procedural justice and organizational \nturnover intentions. \n \nResearch Method \nSample selection and data collection \nThe sample for the study was drawn from accountants working in Australian \npublic accounting firms. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia contacted \npublic accounting firms on our behalf. Seven firms (one Big 4 firm and six middle-tier \nfirms) agreed to participate. A liaison person at each firm distributed survey packages to \nparticipants through each firm\u2019s internal mail system.5 Each survey package contained a \ncover letter explaining the purpose of the study, a three-page questionnaire, and a \npostage-paid envelope. Of the 490 questionnaires sent to participants, 260 were returned, \nfor a response rate of 53%, which is within acceptable limits (Baruch, 1999). \nWe used the following question to identify whether respondents had a mentor: \n\u201cAre you involved in a working relationship with someone of a higher position in your \nfirm, which you believe has helped your career and affected your mobility in \naccounting (i.e., a mentor)?\u201d In this way, we believe our definition of a \u2018mentor\u2019 \nencompasses both formal and informal mentoring.6   \n                                                 \n5 We limited our sample to those accountants below the level of partner as we were interested in capturing \nthe perceptions of individuals with a mentor in a higher position within the firm. \n6 Respondents answering \u201cyes\u201d (125 respondents) were classified as having a mentor, while those \nanswering \u201cno\u201d (135 respondents) were classified as not having a mentor. We label this variable \nMENTOR. For those respondents who answered \u201cyes\u201d, we captured the length (in years) of the mentoring \nrelationship with the question: \u201cHow long have you been involved in your current mentoring relationship?\u201d \n 12 \nVariable measurement \nAll items were scored on a seven-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = \nstrongly agree). We measure mentor support using Viator\u2019s (2001) 16-item instrument, \nwhich measures two aspects of psychosocial support (social support and role modelling) \nand two aspects of career development support (career-related, and protection and \nassistance). As the scale has not been subject to further testing, we examine its \ndimensionality using an exploratory factor analysis (oblique rotation). The initial \nsolution, shown in Table 1, Panel A, shows that the protection and assistance items (PA1-\nPA3) do not load on a single factor; thus, we remove these items and re-run the factor \nanalysis.7  Panel B shows that two factors are extracted, with the social support and role \nmodelling items loading on the first factor, and the career development items loading on \nthe second factor. Thus, we combine the social support and role modelling items to \nconstruct a psychosocial support variable (Cronbach\u2019s alpha=0.91), and the career \ndevelopment items to construct a career development support variable (alpha=0.75).  \n<insert Table 1> \nAffective organizational commitment was measured using Meyer and Allen\u2019s \n(1997) six-item scale. All items loaded on a single factor with an eigenvalue greater than \none. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha is 0.79.  Procedural justice was measured using Moorman\u2019s \n(1991) six-item scale. All items loaded on a single factor with an eigenvalue greater than \none. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha is 0.89. Psychological empowerment was measured with the \n12-item scale developed by Spreitzer (1995), comprising four dimensions (meaning, \ncompetence, self-determination, and impact). Consistent with Hancer, George & Kim \n                                                 \n7 In addition, the Cronbach\u2019s alpha of a scale comprised of the PA items is unacceptable at 0.17, supporting \nour decision to remove these items from the mentor support scale. \n 13 \n(2005) and Fulford & Enz (1995), we find a three-factor structure comprising meaning, \ncompetence and influence (self-determination and impact items).8 Job satisfaction was \nmeasured using a six-item scale adapted from Rusbult and Farrell (1983).9 All items \nloaded on a single factor with an eigenvalue greater than one. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha is \n0.90. Organizational turnover intentions was measured with the two-item scale \ndeveloped by Viator (2001), and Cronbach\u2019s alpha for the scale is 0.79. \nResults \n \nPresence\/absence of a mentor \nResults of a MANOVA show no differences across variables between respondents \nwho report having a mentor and those who do not (F(5, 254) = 1.49, p = 0.193).10 There \nare also no significant differences in means for each dependent variable according to \nMENTOR (all p-values >0.05).  Consistent with calls to examine the quality of the \nmentoring relationship (Allen et al., 2004; Ragins et al., 2000), our results show that the \nmere presence of a mentor has no effect on organizational turnover intentions or any \nother variables in our model.11  \n \nPartial Least Squares (PLS) regression \nWe employ PLS regression analysis using PLS-Graph 3.0 to test our hypotheses. \nWe present results from the measurement model first followed by an examination of the \n                                                 \n8 Full results of the exploratory factor analysis on the psychological empowerment scale are available from \nthe authors. In our tests of hypotheses, we model psychological empowerment as a second-order factor as \nwe are interested in how the overall construct of psychological empowerment is associated with other \nvariables in our model. The second-order factor also allows for a more parsimonious model. \n9 We include job satisfaction in our model as it is likely to intervene in several of the relations between our \nvariables; see footnote 14 for further discussion. \n10 For the MANOVA: independent variable = MENTOR, dependent variables = affective organizational \ncommitment, procedural justice, psychological empowerment, job satisfaction, organizational turnover \nintentions. \n11 Results also show no differences in MENTOR according to firm type (Big 4 vs. middle tier firm) (\u03c72= \n0.116, df = 1, p = 0.734), or gender (\u03c72 = 2.491, df = 1, p = 0.114).   \n 14 \nhypothesized relations between the constructs.12  First, an analysis of PLS cross-loadings \n(not reported) shows that all items load above 0.5 on their respective constructs. Second, \nthe composite reliability scores for each variable are above 0.70 (see Table 2 for \nstatistics). Third, the AVE for all variables except affective organizational commitment \n(0.49) is above 0.50 (Chin, 1998; Hair et al., 1998). Fourth, the square roots of the \nAVEs (diagonal) are all greater than the respective correlations. Overall, the results from \nthe PLS measurement model indicate the constructs exhibit satisfactory reliability and \nconvergent and discriminant validity (Nunnally, 1978; Chin, 1998; Fornell & Larcker, \n1981).   \n<insert Table 2 here> \nTests of hypotheses \nWe estimate a structural model in PLS-Graph to test the hypotheses.13 Figure 1 \nshows our estimated model.14 Our results show a positive association between career \ndevelopment support and psychological empowerment (\u03b2=0.284, p<0.01) (H1), and a \npositive association between psychological empowerment and organizational turnover \n                                                 \n12 Prior research indicates that individuals\u2019 judgments and perceptions about the organization usually take \nat least one year to develop (Vandenberg & Self, 1993). Thus, we remove 18 respondents who reported \nbeing mentored for less than one year, resulting in a final sample of 107. This at least partially allows for \nthe time lag between obtaining a mentor and this having effects on our variables of interest. For the sample \nof 107, the average (standard deviation) age of respondents is 26.78 (5.18) years with an average (standard \ndeviation) tenure in their accounting firm of 3.84 (3.23) years. Forty-nine respondents are male and 58 \nfemale. Eighty-three respondents are from middle-tier firms and 24 are from Big 4 firms. \n13 As PLS makes no distributional assumptions, we use bootstrapping (1000 samples with replacement) to \nevaluate the statistical significance of each path coefficient (Chin, 1998).   \n14In addition to the hypothesized paths, we estimate several paths in the PLS structural model to control for \nother relations among the variables. First, we estimate paths from: procedural justice to job satisfaction \n(see, for example, Parker & Kohlmeyer, 2005); affective organizational commitment to job satisfaction \n(see, for example, Poznanski & Bline, 1997; Fogarty & Kalbers, 2006), psychological empowerment to job \nsatisfaction (Spreitzer et al., 1997; Liden et al., 2000); and job satisfaction to organizational turnover \nintentions (Harrell, 1990; Snead & Harrell, 1991; Pasewark & Strawser, 1996; Pasewark & Viator, 2006). \nSecond, we control for relations among our set of intervening variables. We estimate paths from: \nprocedural justice to affective organizational commitment (Siegel et al., 2001) and psychological \nempowerment to affective organizational commitment (Liden et al., 2000; Kraimer, Seibert & Liden, \n1999). Third, to investigate whether mentoring\u2019s effect on turnover intentions is direct or indirect, we \nestimate paths from psychosocial support and career development support to turnover intentions. \n 15 \nintentions (\u03b2=0.191, p<0.05) (H2). Psychosocial support is positively associated with \naffective organizational commitment (\u03b2=0.233, p<0.05) (H3) and procedural justice \n(\u03b2=0.262, p<0.05) (H4). Further, affective organizational commitment is negatively \nassociated with organizational turnover intentions (\u03b2=-0.295, p<0.01) (H5). The \nassociation between procedural justice and organizational turnover intentions is not \nsignificant (\u03b2=-0.092, p>0.10) (H6).15 Results for control variable paths and explanatory \npower (R2) are shown in Table 3.16 \n<insert Table 3> \n<insert Figure 1 here> \nDiscussion \n Our study contributes to the literature on public accountants\u2019 mentoring and \norganizational turnover intentions by providing an explanation for prior conflicting \nresults. First, we show that the mere presence\/absence of a mentor has no effect on \norganizational turnover intentions or any other variables within our research model. This \nhighlights the importance of investigating the nature of mentoring support, rather than the \npresence\/absence of a mentor. Second, we show that some types of mentoring support \n(specifically, career development support) may increase organizational turnover \nintentions: we find that career development support is positively associated with \n                                                 \n15 We also ran our model on a sample (n=125) inclusive of accountants who had been mentored for less \nthan one year.  The results were qualitatively similar, with the exception of the path from psychosocial \nsupport to psychological empowerment being significant in the larger sample (\u03b2=0.192, p<0.05). \n16 We also assessed the statistical significance of the three indirect effects captured by our hypothesized \npaths. We did this using a technique that does not make distributional assumptions and is appropriate for \nsmall samples. For each of the 1000 bootstraps, we multiply the estimated coefficients for each direct path \nto calculate an estimated coefficient for the indirect effect (e.g., multiply career development support-\npsychological empowerment path coefficient by the psychological empowerment-organizational turnover \nintentions path coefficient). We determine significance by rank-ordering the 1000 indirect effect \ncoefficients and examining the percentage above (for negative effects)\/below (for positive effects) zero. \nResults show that the career development support-psychological empowerment-organizational turnover \nintentions path is significant (p=0.03), as is the psychosocial support-affective organizational commitment-\norganizational turnover intentions path (p=0.023). The psychosocial support-procedural justice-\norganizational turnover intentions path is not significant (p=0.113).  \n 16 \npsychological empowerment, which, in turn, is positively associated with organizational \nturnover intentions. This is contrary to the conventional view that \u201cgood\u201d mentoring \nnecessarily leads to desirable outcomes for the firm (e.g. employee retention). However, \nour findings are consistent with theory that predicts that forms of organizational support \nthat enhance employees\u2019 beliefs about their ability to secure valued alternative \nemployment can increase turnover intentions (Maertz & Griffeth, 2004; Ito & \nBrotheridge, 2006; Harris, Kacmar, & Witt, 2005; Benson et al., 2004).17   \nOur findings raise an interesting question \u2013 should accounting firms de-emphasize \ncareer development support mentoring? We argue that both types of mentor support are \nimportant for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s\u2019 development, and that one should not be ignored in favour of the \nother. However, our results should encourage accounting firms to re-think the efficacy \nand design of mentoring programs insofar as they are aimed at reducing employee \nturnover. In particular, for formal mentoring, accounting firms can instruct mentors on \nthe likely effects of different types of mentor support on prot\u00e9g\u00e9s\u2019 turnover intentions and \nbehaviours. Whilst more difficult for informal mentoring, it appears necessary to develop \nan awareness among actual and potential mentors of the likely effects that career \ndevelopment support can have on turnover behaviour, perhaps through education \nprograms and\/or more specific guidance.  \nThe effect of career development support on turnover is likely to be particularly \nproblematic in tight labour markets and in situations where prot\u00e9g\u00e9s feel stressed, \nundervalued and\/or dissatisfied at work. As such, a focus on mentoring practices should \n                                                 \n17 Although we include many control variables and also control for the time lag between obtaining a mentor \nand this affecting our variables of interest, our results are subject to limitations associated with cross-\nsectional questionnaire-based studies, such as an inability to make causal inferences and the possibility of \ncorrelated omitted variables.  \n 17 \nnot occur in isolation from other mechanisms. In particular, it is important for accounting \nfirms to examine closely the operation of other organizational practices (for example, \ninternal promotion opportunities, salary increases, work flexibility- see Almer, Higgs & \nHooks, 2005) to counteract against the potential loss of staff who have received strong \ncareer development support.  \nOur paper points to several fruitful areas for future research. First, as our results \nshow that some forms of organizational support increase turnover intentions, further \nresearch could consider whether and how other types of organizational support (e.g., \nleader-member exchange, supervisor support) relate to turnover intentions in accounting \nfirms. Second, whilst our study has focused on how mentor support affects prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, \nfuture research could investigate the antecedents of different forms of mentor support. In \nparticular, consideration of how firm (e.g., formal mentor programs, mentor training) and \nmentor (e.g., personality, interpersonal skills, hierarchical position) characteristics affect \na mentor\u2019s ability to provide psychosocial and career development support represents a \npromising line of enquiry. Finally, it is also important to examine whether or how \nmentoring practices combine with other organizational practices to influence prot\u00e9g\u00e9s\u2019 \nbeliefs and work behaviours. Such research could be pursued through field-studies of \nprot\u00e9g\u00e9s where the wide variety of practices that shape their behaviours can be examined.  \n \n 18 \nReferences \nAllen, T.D., Eby, L.T., Poteet, M.L., Lentz, E., & Lima, L.
