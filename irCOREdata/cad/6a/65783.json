This study\nexamines how consensus is affected by the structure of\ninteraction in the network connecting social audiences to\ncandidate organizations. It analyzes how audience mem-\nbers reach, reinforce, and preserve consensus about can-\ndidates\u2019 features and behavior, affecting a crucial organi-\nzational outcome, survival. The findings show that\nsurvival is enhanced by the degree of connectivity and\nthe repeated interactions between audience members\nand candidate organizations and is reduced by the degree\nof turnover of audience members. We situate our analysis\nin the U.S. motion picture industry, where we trace the\ninterorganizational network between feature film produc-\ner organizations (candidates) and distributor organiza-\ntions (the audience) and its influence on producer organi-\nzations\u2019 exit rates over the period 1912\u20131970. We find\nstrong support for the claim that the legitimation process\nhas a relational foundation that involves ties between\norganizational entities and the external others with whom\nthey interact. The results contribute to the dialogue\nbetween ecological and network theories of organizations\nand support the claim that legitimation has a relational\nfoundation involving ties between organizations and\naudiences.\u2022\nBuilding and sustaining organizations depends on the avail-\nability of environmental resources, and legitimation signifies\nthe process by which social acceptance (or legitimacy) facili-\ntates organizations\u2019 task of accessing these resources\n(Stinchcombe, 1965; Weber, 1968). Legitimacy also grants\norganizations the capacity to defend their claims on\nresources against other contending social units (Hannan and\nCarroll, 1992; Scott, 1995; Hannan, P\u00f3los, and Carroll, 2007).\nAs a necessary condition for creating and maintaining steady\nresource flows from the environment (Meyer and Rowan,\n1977), legitimacy is directly linked to organizational outcomes\nsuch as vital rates of founding and mortality (Carroll and Han-\nnan, 2000).\nSociologists fundamentally consider legitimation a collective\nprocess that implies the presence of both social audiences\nand social objects being evaluated and that depends on audi-\nences\u2019 consensus about what features and actions these\nobjects should have to be accepted in social contexts (John-\nson, Dowd, and Ridgeway, 2006; Ridgeway and Correll,\n2006). As a collective construction of social reality, legitima-\ntion has a cognitive dimension, whereby agents recognize a\nsocial object as valid and taken for granted, and a normative-\nprescriptive dimension that represents the social object as\nright (Berger and Luckmann, 1966; P\u00f3los, Hannan, and Car-\nroll, 2002).\nOrganizational research has echoed this formulation of legiti-\nmacy. Whether legitimacy is the result of sociopolitical\nprocesses\u2014what a society\u2019s norms and institutional rules\nendorse and prohibit (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983; Baum and\nOliver, 1992)\u2014or the product of cognitive processes\u2014a set\nof schemas or beliefs agents collectively share (Carroll and\n\u00a9 2008 by Johnson Graduate School,\nCornell University.\n0001-8392\/08\/5301-0145\/$3.00.\n\u2022\nAll authors contributed equally and are\nlisted in alphabetical order.

Although extant research has enhanced our\nunderstanding of the processes that grant or withdraw legiti-\nmacy, the conditions fostering audience convergence toward\na common set of social codes, as well as the persistence of\nsuch codes throughout the social domain, remain underex-\nplored. Still relatively undeveloped is how \u201cthe structure and\ndynamics of the audience .|.|. might affect consensus forma-\ntion\u201d (Hannan, P\u00f3los, and Carroll, 2007: 302\u2013303). If audi-\nences and candidates coevolve, the question is how the\nprocess of legitimation is affected by the exchange structure\nconnecting candidate organizations to their social audiences.\nIt is the characteristics of this exchange structure that should\ninfluence the likelihood of establishing consensus around\ncandidates\u2019 accepted features and patterns of behavior,\nhence affecting candidates\u2019 survival rates.\nBuilding on social network studies concerned with the trans-\nmission and acceptance of knowledge, political agreement\n(classic works include Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet,\n1944; Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee, 1954), and social\nconformity (Sherif, 1936; Festinger, 1957; Thibaut and Kelley,\n1959; Coleman, Katz, and Menzel, 1966), we suggest three\nbasic conditions under which consensus\u2014agreement within\nthe audience on the candidates to accept or to exclude\u2014is\nreached, strengthened, and preserved: the degree of connec-\ntivity of the network between audience members and candi-\ndate organizations, repeated interactions between audiences\nand candidates, and the degree of turnover of audience\nmembers. The first two conditions\u2014connectivity and repeat-\ned interactions\u2014are the result of mutual interactions\nbetween the audience and candidates and account for the\ncreation of consensus among audience members about\nwhich features and behaviors candidates must exhibit in\norder to be accepted or excluded. While connectivity defines\nthe threshold of candidates\u2019 acceptance by signaling their\ninclusion as members, repeated interactions highlight candi-\ndates\u2019 exemplariness by signaling preferred audiences\u2019 inter-\nactions among accepted candidates. The third condition, audi-\nence turnover, is a structural feature of audiences that affects\nthe stability of consensus or the lack thereof.\nWe developed and tested hypotheses on audience consen-\nsus and firm survival in the U.S. feature film industry from\n1912 to the end of 1970, focusing on the ties between pro-\nducer and distributor organizations. Because they act as gate-\nkeepers for producers\u2019 output to exhibitors and spectators\nand access to relevant resources, distributors are members\nof a crucial audience for producers, and producers are candi-\ndates for that audience\u2019s evaluation (Hannan, 2005). Although\nother audiences play an important role in this setting (e.g.,\n146\/ASQ, March 2008\nmovie critics, exhibitors, moviegoers), the central nature of\nthe relationship between producer and distributor organiza-\ntions makes it especially useful for examining the audience-\ncandidate interface and the consensus that leads to\nlegitimation.\nCONSENSUS AND LEGITIMATION\nLegitimation has been recognized as a cornerstone of organi-\nzational theories attempting to explain organizational action\n(Scott, 1995). Organizational action is subject to social scruti-\nny by a variety of external agents, including other organiza-\ntions, public authorities, intermediaries, and consumers.\nThese agents (or audiences) consider the features and activi-\nties of organizations (candidates) in relation to what they\nexpect organizations can or should do. Social codes originate\nfrom this set of expectations, generating approval and advan-\ntages when respected but also posing limits to action due to\nimplied sanctions if expectations are violated (Zuckerman,\n1999).\nRecent contributions in institutional and ecological research\nhave emphasized the role of social expectations and consen-\nsus on those expectations in shaping legitimation and various\noutcomes vital for individuals, organizations, and populations\n(Zuckerman, 1999; Carroll and Hannan, 2000; Zuckerman et\nal., 2003; Hsu and Hannan, 2005; Hannan, P\u00f3los, and Carroll,\n2007). Consensus is a critical stage in any social process of\nevaluation. Similarly, the first step in the audience-candidate\nprocess of evaluation is that audiences reach consensus to\nvalidate organizational action (Zuckerman, 1999: 1406; but\nsee also DiMaggio, 1982; Rosa et al., 1999). Without this\nconsensus, determining the behaviors viewed as legitimate,\nand therefore the organizations that will receive or be denied\nlegitimate standing, remains highly uncertain. By conferring\nlegitimacy on candidates, audiences act as autonomous gate-\nkeepers whose influence can determine the fate of products\nor organizations (Hirsch, 1972). Organizations that successful-\nly pass audiences\u2019 scrutiny can access material and symbolic\nresources more easily, enhancing their life chances; those\nthat do not conform to audiences\u2019 expectations experience\ndifficulty in maintaining the flows of environmental resources\n(Hannan, P\u00f3los, and Carroll, 2007). In his study of illegitimacy\ncosts in the stock market, Zuckerman (1999) demonstrated\nthat when American companies were not covered by the\nsecurities analysts who specialized in the industries in which\nthey operated, their stock prices suffered discounts. Similarly,\nZuckerman and colleagues (2003) argued that the interaction\nbetween employers and prospective employees can be\nframed as an interface between a set of candidates who\ncompete with one another to be selected by an audience.\nEmployers screen candidates according to recognized cogni-\ntive categories, and candidates \u201cwho succeed in associating\nthemselves with one such category enjoy greater success in\nattracting employers\u2019 attention\u201d (p. 1021). On the contrary,\nagents who defy prevailing socio-cognitive frames risk\nengendering ambiguity among relevant audiences, thereby\nproducing penalties in the form of lack of attention or outright\nrejection.\n147\/ASQ, March 2008\nNetwork Ties and Legitimation\nStructural theory on social influence (e.g., Friedkin, 1998) and\nstudies on political disagreement (e.g., Huckfeldt, Johnson,\nand Sprague, 2004) have elucidated the conditions that foster\nthe creation and stability of consensus. Both strands of\nresearch stress the importance of examining structural char-\nacteristics of the relationships that connect agents. These lit-\neratures typically focus on the structural characteristics of\nnetworks among agents located in the same social position,\nsuch as citizens voting for a new president, but they would\nalso apply to a network with two distinct organizational popu-\nlations whose interaction can be framed in terms of an audi-\nence-candidate interface. Consensus on codes would depend\non three major characteristics of this network: connectivity\nbetween the audience and the candidates, the number of\nrepeated interactions between the audience and the candi-\ndates, and audience turnover, or instability. These conditions\ndescribe distinct, though complementary mechanisms shap-\ning consensus formation and change.\nNetwork Connectivity\nNetwork-based models of social influence suggest that struc-\nturally connected networks foster the formation and develop-\nment of consensus among network members (Harary, 1959;\nFriedkin, 1998; Moody, 2004). Multiple features of connected\nnetworks facilitate convergence toward consensus. First, net-\nworks comprising highly interconnected agents allow for\nbroader and timelier propagation of information (Owen-Smith\nand Powell, 2004; Powell et al., 2004). Network members\nexchange ideas, information, and implicit rules with their part-\nners. Interactions in more connected networks stimulate con-\nvergence toward common schemas. This, in turn, results in\nless uncertainty as information gaps are more easily filled\n(Walker, Kogut, and Shan, 1997). Also, because the scope for\ninformation variation is narrower, the likelihood of being\nexposed to unique information in more connected networks\nis usually lower.\nSecond, higher levels of network connectivity signal member-\nship in a collective entity and reduce ambiguity about legiti-\nmate organizational identities. A network refers not only to\nsocial relations, to the links that connect specific individuals\ndirectly or indirectly, but also to meanings and categories and\nthe attributes possessed by individuals (White, 1992; Moody\nand White, 2003). Individuals make choices by observing the\nfate of others who have faced similar choices and the pat-\nterns and outcomes that emerge from relations among other\nactors in the network (Leifer and White, 1987: 86). By signal-\ning membership, general connectivity fosters the emergence\nof a more tightly linked and coherent community, i.e., a \u201ccat-\nnet\u201d (White, 1992), in which members share the same ties\nand the same categories. The higher the level of connectivity\nwithin a social domain, the more extensive are its common\nidentity and its ability to articulate a common interest.\nInterconnected networks also provide multiple avenues by\nwhich deviant behaviors are promptly identified (Gnyawali\nand Madhavan, 2001). Robinson and Stuart (2007) suggested\nthat the aggregate network structure becomes a platform for\ndiffusing information about the transactional integrity of\n148\/ASQ, March 2008\nexchange partners. By spreading information about agents\u2019\nbehaviors, network connectivity facilitates the definition of\ncollective sanctions that \u201cinvolve group members punishing\nother members who violate group norms, values, or goals\nand range from gossip and rumors to ostracism (exclusion\nfrom the network for short periods or indefinitely) and sabo-\ntage\u201d (Jones, Hesterly, and Borgatti, 1997: 931). Acheson\u2019s\n(1985) study of Maine lobster trapping illustrates how collec-\ntive sanctions are enforced when agents in a connected net-\nwork break widely shared social norms: interlopers who vio-\nlate the accepted demarcation of fishing territories, for\nexample, are sanctioned through surreptitious destruction of\ntheir traps.\nDifferent considerations hold for fragmented networks in\nwhich exchange activities tend to remain confined to self-\ncontained groups or sub-networks, thereby impeding wide-\nspread information flows across the social domain. The pres-\nence of self-contained groups with relatively impermeable\ncommunication networks engenders diversity in social\nnorms. Each group develops distinct sets of norms that dif-\nferentiate that group from other social groups. Thus candi-\ndates typically encounter norms that are inconsistent, point-\ning them in different directions, and ambiguous in that\n\u201cexpectations are incomplete or insufficient so that the\nappropriate action is uncertain\u201d (Friedkin, 1998: 13). Connec-\ntivity increases the taken-for-granted character of a set of\nnorms. How agents perceive the natural way of collective\naction forms the basis of constitutive legitimation (Carroll and\nHannan, 2000: 223) and enhances the ability of organizations\nto access resources and fend off challenges. Higher connec-\ntivity of the system should reduce ambiguity about organiza-\ntional action and foster consensus on the rules that specify\nwhat types of agents are allowed to exist, what actions are\nconceivable, and what meanings are associated with these\nactions (Ruef and Scott, 1998: 877). Hence, we hypothesize:\nHypothesis 1: Increasing connectivity in the audience-candidate net-\nwork reduces candidates\u2019 exit rates.\nRepeated Interactions\nStudies dealing with the social psychology of groups highlight\nthe importance of repeated interactions in the development\nof norms (Sherif, 1936; Festinger, 1957). Interactions consist\nof agents that exhibit behaviors in each other\u2019s presence, cre-\nate products for each other, and communicate with each\nother (Thibaut and Kelley, 1959: 10). A social norm exists only\nin a category of recurrent situations and cannot be developed\nthrough accidental or temporary interpersonal contacts. In\ntheir study on dyadic relationships, Thibaut and Kelley (1959)\nshowed that a norm is a behavioral rule that is at least partial-\nly accepted by both members of the dyad or, in larger\ngroups, by a majority of members, and is the result of repeat-\ned interactions. Consensus is strengthened by a trial-and-\nerror process in which conformity to rules and agreements\nthat have proved rewarding in past interactions is preserved\nin the future. The idea that consensus is reinforced through\nrepeated interaction is also prevalent in political communica-\ntion studies. Sociologists have argued that when the frequen-\n149\/ASQ, March 2008\nNetwork Ties and Legitimation\ncy of political communication among citizens increases, indi-\nvidual political preferences are increasingly exposed to social\nscrutiny (Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee, 1954; Katz and\nLazarsfeld, 1955; Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet, 1944;\nMcPhee, 1963). Previously idiosyncratic preferences become\nsocially visible, and individuals correspondingly conform to\ntheir surroundings (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague, 2004:\n19).\nSocial situations constantly demand actions or opinions\n(Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet, 1944). In their analysis of\nthe mechanisms and process through which a group devel-\nops common attitudes, Lazarsfeld and his colleagues high-\nlighted how mutual interactions of group members are more\npowerful than other mechanisms in explaining the formation,\nchange, and development of public opinion. As mutual inter-\nactions take place, a new distribution of articulate opinions\nand attitudes emerges or is reinforced. When no prior atti-\ntudes exist, mutual interactions will form definite opinions;\nwhen prior attitudes exist, mutual interactions will crystallize\nthem. The formation of opinions can be compared with the\nkinds of problems with which economists have struggled for\nmany years. Economists have viewed prices stabilizing as a\nconsequence of the interaction between supply and the\ndemand of individuals. Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet\n(1944: xxiv) saw this dynamic as similar to the distribution of\nopinion in a group: \u201cIn neither case can the final result be\nexplained by the previous actions or opinions of individuals\nconsidered separately. In both cases the final result is a func-\ntion of interactions which have as their by-product something\nwhich had not existed before.\u201d\nMutual interactions among organizations foster the emer-\ngence and development of common attitudes and public\nopinion. By engaging in mutual interactions, organizations are\nlikely to disclose some of the private information and experi-\nences that support common attitudes. The end result of such\ninteractions is reinforcement, a mutual strengthening of com-\nmon attitudes (Granovetter, 1973; Larson, 1992). Also, organi-\nzations that repeat collaborations may serve as reference\npoints for other agents who may evolve roles from observa-\ntions of repeated behaviors (White, 2001). The extent to\nwhich candidates are treated as preferred members of a pop-\nulation and their offerings as typical increases taken-for-grant-\nedness and the associated organizational benefits (Hannan,\nP\u00f3los, and Carroll, 2007). Accordingly, we hypothesize:\nHypothesis 2: Increasing repeated interactions in the audience-can-\ndidate network reduces candidates\u2019 exit rates.\nAudience Turnover\nSocial organizations often exhibit continuity so that as mem-\nbers leave and are replaced by other members, complex\norganizations can still function as ongoing social units\n(McNeil and Thompson, 1971: 624). Yet sociological studies\nindicate that organizational continuity depends both on the\nenduring commitment of old-timers, such as veterans in\norganizations, long-time activists in social movements, or the\n\u201cold guard\u201d in political parties, and on the inclusion of new-\n150\/ASQ, March 2008\ncomers. At the same time, the emergence of new partici-\npants in the social process and the withdrawal of their prede-\ncessors can threaten stability and provide the opportunity for\nsocial transformations (Ryder, 1965). Generational processes\nof recruitment and cohort turnover can thus produce change\nin social organizations (White, 1970; McNeil and Thompson,\n1971) and movements (Whittier, 1997).\nEven if new entrants share basic assumptions and goals with\ntheir predecessors, they often differ in important ways.\nUnaware of specific routines and tacit knowledge, newcom-\ners\u2019 ingenuity, improvisation, and diversity of experience\nbring a fresh perspective to the organization or the group\n(March, 1991; Jackson, Stone, and Alvarez, 1993). Though\nslower turnover permits greater socialization of new mem-\nbers by experienced ones and therefore leads to greater\norganizational continuity, extensive recruitment can lead long-\ntenured members to lose power, allowing new members to\ngain influence within established organizations or groups\n(Whittier, 1997).\nSimilar processes would be at work in the continuity or\npreservation of consensus. Norms tend to persist once\nestablished. They do not need to be reinvented when a new\nrelationship is formed and often can be transferred from\nexisting relationships. But new audience members need time\nto learn established codes and may instead foster changes.\nEspecially when audience turnover is high, new members\nhave more difficulty in learning established norms and are\nmore likely to change them if they are less exposed to veter-\nans and the existing code. Until a new consensus is reached,\ndifferent norms will proliferate and vie for dominance. As\nnorms increase in number, they inevitably begin to overlap\nand compete. Because norms often are inconsistent, decid-\ning which norms should receive precedence and which\nshould be applicable to specific cases becomes increasingly\ndifficult (Thibaut and Kelley, 1959: 140). As a result of higher\nturnover levels, unique identities (White, 1992) and diverse\nschools of thought (Price and de Solla, 1963) emerge, and\nconsensus around a shared set of social norms becomes\nharder to achieve. As highlighted by Hannan, P\u00f3los, and Car-\nroll (2007: 54), \u201cThe ability of the members of an audience\nsegment to reach agreement .|.|. is potentially\nproblematic.|.|.|. For instance, [some members] could be in\nopen competition with others, and conflict and strategic\nbehavior .|.|. might preclude agreement.\u201d Because shared\nnorms help to identify and sanction deviant behaviors, the\nabsence of consensus due to audience turnover not only\namplifies uncertainty about candidates\u2019 appropriate behavior\nbut also lowers behavioral pressures to conform. Lack of con-\nsensus and increased uncertainty reduce the satisfaction of\nexpectations, compound the problem of maintaining a steady\nflow of resources from the environment, and thus hamper\norganizational survival. Hence, we hypothesize:\nHypothesis 3: Greater audience turnover in the audience-candidate\nnetwork increases candidates\u2019 exit rates.\n151\/ASQ, March 2008\nNetwork Ties and Legitimation\nLegitimacy, Social Codes, and Consensus in the American\nFeature Film Industry\nIn his ethnographic account of Hollywood filmmaking, Pow-\ndermaker (1950: 35) argued that just as every social system\noperates under a number of institutionalized controls regulat-\ning economic and social life, so Hollywood has its specific\ncodes or taboos that \u201cinfluence the methods of production,\nthe relationships between people, and leave their stamps on\nthe movies.\u201d Movies and their producers are evaluated on\nfeatures that include details such as (1) \u201cnames\u201d\u2014i.e.,\nstars; (2) \u201cproduction value\u201d\u2014elaborate sets, big crowds,\nand other indicators of great expense; (3) \u201cstory value\u201d\u2014the\nprice paid for the original story and its reputation as a novel\nor play; (4) \u201cpicture sense\u201d\u2014the conglomeration of all these\nitems; and (5) \u201cbox office appeal\u201d\u2014the standardized values\nthat proved successful in years past (see Jacobs, 1939:\n295\u2013296).\nThe interaction between producer and distributor organiza-\ntions lies at the center of this system of controls, and distrib-\nutors are the ones who evaluate production methods and the\nlegitimacy of producer organizations. As one early economic\nanalysis noted, \u201c.|.|. By virtue of the division of labor within\nthe business, film distributors are much more closely in\ntouch with the moviegoing public than are the producers, and\nthey trade heavily on their advantageous positions. From\ntheir seat in the box office they announce that so-and-so is\n\u2018poison at the box office\u2019, that what the public wants is musi-\ncals or blood-and-thunder westerns, that English stars murder\nbusiness, and that sophisticated farce comedies leave their\naudiences completely cold\u201d (Huettig, 1944: 230). Sixty years\nlater, distributors continue to \u201cact as gatekeepers: they\ndecide which movies get produced and how they are made,\nand they also largely determine when and at what price view-\ners get to see them on which media.|.|.|. Producers, direc-\ntors, and other talent make their movies with varying degrees\nof creative autonomy,\u201d but mainly, distributors \u201cmaintain\noverall control of the production process\u201d (Waterman, 2005:\n16-17).\nGiven the central role distributor organizations played within\nthe system, they represent a critical audience, and their rela-\ntionships with producers have always influenced the content\nand meaning of what producers do. The formulas for pictures\nhave been a series of constantly changing do\u2019s and don\u2019ts,\nsuch as, \u201cYou cannot make an A picture about a prize fight,\u201d\n\u201cNo pictures with any kind of message do make money,\u201d\n\u201cThe love story must be the most important part of an A pic-\nture\u201d (Powdermaker, 1950: 40). Departure from the codes\nresults in harmful consequences, like obstructed channels to\nobtaining resources: \u201cViolators of these taboos do not com-\nmit suicide nor are they killed by members of their clan. But\nthey are refused its seal of approval, which is considered a\nform of business suicide\u201d (Powdermaker, 1950: 55). The\nbankruptcy of Triangle Film Corporation is one of the most\nfamous examples of business suicide. Triangle Film Corpora-\ntion was a major production company founded in 1915 by\nHarry and Roy Aitken, based on the producing abilities of\nfilmmakers D. W. Griffith, Thomas Ince, and Mack Sennett.\n152\/ASQ, March 2008\nAitken\u2019s goal for Triangle was clear: to produce motion pic-\ntures that articulated exclusive, highbrow cultural values and\nyet to appeal to a broad, cross-class audience. Less than a\nyear after its birth, however, Triangle found itself on the brink\nof financial ruin, having failed to attract audiences of any\nclass (King, 2005). Part of the reason was the epic fiasco of\nGriffith\u2019s grandiose Intolerance (1916), a colossal undertaking\nfilled with monumental sets, lavish period costumes, and\nmore than 3,000 extras. The movie was by far the most\nexpensive made at that point, and when it became a flop at\nthe box-office, the burden was so great that Triangle Studios\nwent bankrupt.\nThe production process of Intolerance presented unusual\ncharacteristics that departed from established conventions\n(Drew, 1986). First, an unorthodox editing was used to por-\ntray an elaborately interwoven collection of four distinct but\nparallel stories that covered 2,500 years during different ages\nin world history. Critics and European film theorists praised\nthis technique, which became enormously influential, particu-\nlarly among Soviet filmmakers, but for the moviegoers, it was\ndifficult to follow the story. Second, none of the characters\nhad names because they had to be emblematic of human\ntypes across history, but the moral and psychological connec-\ntions among the different stories were too subtle for most of\nthe moviegoers, leaving them unengaged. Third, the majestic\nbuildings of the outdoor sets, which were the largest ever\nbuilt in motion pictures, were constructed in their entirety,\nnot just the parts that had to be filmed. This allowed more\nfreedom in filmmaking but increased the costs of the produc-\ntion enormously. Actual costs to produce Intolerance are\nunknown, but best estimates are close to $2 million, an\nastronomical sum in 1916. When the movie failed, these\nunusual characteristics became established taboos for pro-\nducers in the industry for the next 80 years. The movie Titan-\nic (1997) was the only other film for which an entire com-\nplete set was built (Parisi, 1998: 134).\nJust as primitive societies think \u201cfailure would result from\nchanging the form of a spell, so men in Hollywood consider it\ndangerous to depart from their formulas. Each group can\npoint to the times it worked and conveniently forget or ratio-\nnalize the other occasions\u201d (Powdermaker, 1950: 285). When\ndistributors disagree about such formulas, like what consti-\ntutes \u201cnames\u201d or \u201cproduction value,\u201d or \u201cstory value,\u201d pro-\nducers are less likely to receive resources for their produc-\ntions. When, in 1914, D. W. Griffith proposed to produce a\npicture dealing with the American Civil War, he was confront-\ned with immediate opposition. Some leaders of the industry,\nwho even in 1914 showed a tendency toward \u201ccreative stan-\ndardization,\u201d went so far as to try to block both the produc-\ntion and the distribution of The Birth of a Nation. Griffith had\nto seek his financial backing entirely among people outside\nthe industry. During the early and precarious life of the\nmotion picture industry, bankers were not attracted to this\nbusiness, partly because the business was new and\nunknown but most of all because the customary standards of\ncredit rating could not be applied. In 1926, the banker A. P.\nGiannini, a pioneer in the financing of motion picture produc-\n153\/ASQ, March 2008\nNetwork Ties and Legitimation\ntion, opined that market value in film depended on \u201cthe pres-\nence of artists or producer organizations of recognized stand-\ning\u201d (Wall Street Journal, 1926: 3). When value was in doubt,\nthe judgment of a half-dozen distribution exchange or theater\nmanagers allowed one to obtain an immediate rating. The\nacceptance or rejection evaluations by audience members,\ntherefore, critically influenced what resources would be avail-\nable for filmmaking.\nInformation is necessary to navigate the film industry.\nAlthough a great deal of information is available on the status\nof ongoing projects or the performance of completed pro-\njects, such information requires decoding and has varying\ndegrees of reliability. The wisdom of the \u201cmovie colony\u201d is\nconveyed not through formal blueprints but through the use\nof deep symbolism, relationships, and constant interactions.\nFormulas and taboos are the result of knowledge and tradi-\ntions based on instinct: \u201cThe movie makers work with hunch-\nes, not logic; they trade in impressions rather than analyses.\nIt is natural that they court the intuitive and shun the system-\natic, for they are expert in the one and untutored in the\nother\u201d (Rosten, 1948: 48). Other fields similarly fail to articu-\nlate fully the bases of their valuations. In the art world, Beck-\ner (1982: 199) observed, \u201c.|.|. artists find it difficult to verbal-\nize the general principles on which they make their choices.\nThey often resort to such non-communicative statements as\n\u2018it sounds better that way,\u2019 \u2018it looked good to me,\u2019 or \u2018it\nworks.\u2019\u201d\nIn such a context, more connected networks between pro-\nducer and distributor organizations provide several advan-\ntages. First, producer organizations are less likely to require\njustification for their work but are also less likely to invest in\nunconventional formulas for which there are few current\nresources available, as in experiments in color pictures prior\nto the 1950s (Bordwell, Staiger, and Thompson, 1985). Sec-\nond, they have access to more consistent information about\nproduction trends, and if they inadvertently target popular\nand oversaturated film genres, such as westerns in the\n1920s, they could find themselves in a weaker position to\nobtain resources (Lewis, 1933). Similarly, repeated interac-\ntions between production and distribution organizations can\ngenerate various advantages not offered by networks with\nepisodic interactions. For example, they can allow producer\norganizations to calibrate styles and features that distributors\nhave noted are likely to receive limited critical and public\nacceptance, as happened with non-narrative films. In serial\nproductions, this calibration fine-tunes new elements while\nholding the others constant.\nThe influence of social codes is also affected by turnover in\nthe industry network. Replacement of personnel and organi-\nzations, including distributors, is an important characteristic of\nthe film industry. As Rosten (1948: 37) noted, \u201cAs a profes-\nsional community which is itself young, and whose popula-\ntion is weighted toward youth composition, the movie busi-\nness moves with relentless speed.\u201d Hollywood\u2019s traditionally\nyoung profile makes it \u201cnot surprising then that the movie\ncolony has not achieved stability or integration.\u201d And Pow-\ndermaker (1950: 39\u201340) explained that Hollywood has \u201cdeep\n154\/ASQ, March 2008\nroots in the past, which dominates the present; but there are\nalso new tendencies, some of which may be merely aberra-\ntions\u2014and others, signposts to the future.|.|.|. Each one of\nthe formulas has been successfully broken and shown to be\nfalse at one time or another. But each time anyone departs\nfrom the formula and meets with success, the departure\nthen becomes another formula.\u201d\nMETHOD\nData\nWe analyzed an original database that includes all motion pic-\nture producer organizations in the United States. The obser-\nvation period begins in 1912, the year of release of the first\nAmerican-produced feature film, and ends in 1970, the last\nyear covered by the primary data source. Although the first\npublic screening of motion pictures in the United States\ndates to 1895, it was not until 1912 that production compa-\nnies started making and showing multiple-reel feature films.\nFeature-length films, usually defined as longer than four reels\n(each reel runs 1,000 feet, or about 10 minutes), altered the\norganization of all activities within the industry. Not only were\nfeature films longer, but they also were more complex to\nmake and market, requiring higher levels of capital invest-\nment and differentiated marketing efforts (Bordwell, Staiger,\nand Thompson, 1985).\nWe reconstructed the life histories of producing organizations\nthrough the release dates of their films. Producer organiza-\ntions enter the population with the release of their first film\nand exit it the first day following the release date of their last\nfilm (see also Mezias and Mezias, 2000). We examined all\nfilms produced in the United States during the study period\nand reconstructed the evolution of the network by linking the\nproducer and distributor organizations. As with other corpo-\nrate demography studies using product-level information,\nthese data do not account for the duration of pre-production\nprocesses (Carroll and Hannan, 2000), but the short period of\ntime necessary to produce a film\u2014on average, production\ncompanies complete a film in six to eighteen months\u2014limits\nthe importance of pre-production periods.\nThe American Film Institute (AFI) Catalog of Motion Pictures\nProduced in the United States: Feature Films, 1911\u20131970\n(1989\u20131999, Berkeley: University of California Press) serves\nas the primary data source. This directory comprises reviews\nof all motion pictures distributed in the U.S. between 1893\nand 1970 and provides detailed information on each film. In\naddition to this primary source, we also collected industry-\nlevel statistics and supplemental information from two ency-\nclopedic publications, The Motion Picture Year Book and the\nMotion Picture Almanac. Although experts generally consider\nthe AFI catalog the most complete and comprehensive\nsource on the film industry (Mezias and Mezias, 2000), it has\none shortcoming: it lists feature films released in the periods\n1911\u20131950 and 1960\u20131970 but only partially documents the\nperiod from 1951 to 1960. To fill this missing window, we\nconsulted additional sources: (1) A. G. Fetrow\u2019s (1999) filmog-\nraphy, covering film production in the U.S. in the 1950s; (2)\nthe Motion Picture Catalog of the Library of Congress, which\n155\/ASQ, March 2008\nNetwork Ties and Legitimation\nprovides a list of all films that received copyright protection\nfrom 1950 to 1959, along with their respective production\nand distribution companies; and (3) The Motion Picture Guide\n1927\u20131982, a reference set edited by J. R. Nash and S. R.\nRoss (1985\u20131986; New York: Cinebooks) that provides com-\nparable information. We restricted the population of producer\norganizations in several ways. We excluded films produced\nand released for non-commercial purposes, such as those\ncommissioned by government agencies. We also excluded\nimported films, as these come from non-U.S. based produc-\ntion companies. In cases of international co-production, we\nincluded films in which an American producer organization\nappeared as the first stakeholder.1 Finally, we excluded films\nfrom the late 1960s that provided no information on genre.\nVariables\nAnalyzing failure, or exit rates, is a typical strategy to test\necological theories. Accordingly, our dependent variable is\nexit rates of feature film producer organizations from the\nmarket. Organizations can exit in many different ways, includ-\ning disbanding, bankruptcy, merger, or acquisition. For this\nstudy, we could only identify mergers that resulted in a\nmerged entity that produced a film following the merger.\nWhen a dominant partner existed, we treated it as having\nsurvived and the subordinate partner as having exited. As we\ncould not distinguish between other modes of exit, we did\nnot attempt to analyze transition rates for these different\ntypes of events separately. The network in this setting is rep-\nresented by two vertically related sets: producer organiza-\ntions selling their product (feature films) and distributor orga-\nnizations. The analysis considers the population of producer\norganizations as candidates and distributor organizations as\naudience members interacting with candidates. To gauge the\nstructural dynamics of the network connecting audiences and\ncandidates, we modeled it as a valued bipartite undirected\nnetwork (Asratian, Denley, and Haggkvist, 1998). In this net-\nwork, each film title represents an attachment between the\ntwo sets (i.e., producer organizations supplying a film to a\ndistributor). Thus we assumed these attachments to be\nhomogeneous for a producer organization i and distributor j,\nwith aij,t denoting the number of films produced by producer\norganization i for distributor j at time t.\nIn defining a tie, we had to make an assumption about the\nduration of the relationship between producer and distributor\norganizations. With no control for relationship decay, network\nconnectedness of the domain would be highly inflated due to\nthe inclusion of ties to inactive agents. Following a common\npractice in network studies, we used a moving window to\ncontrol for the duration of each tie, hence making the adja-\ncency matrixes time-varying (e.g., Podolny, Stuart, and Han-\nnan, 1996; Gulati and Gargiulo, 1999). In the analysis, we\nused a three-year moving window: if one organization did not\nappear in the industry for three years, that organization and\nits ties were removed from the network in the fourth year,\nbut we integrated that organization and its links back into the\nnetwork if it reentered the industry the following year (see\nalso Uzzi and Spiro, 2005). Thus the adjacency matrix for a\ngiven year traces collaborations formed in that year and in\n1\nIn supplemental analyses, we added con-\ntrols for the cases of co-production, co-\ndistribution, and cooperative distribution\nbut found no significant effects or impact\non the results we present. We also exam-\nined cases of producer organizations\nreleasing their films through regional dis-\ntribution channels and found that regional\nsub-distribution increased producer com-\npanies\u2019 exit rates, perhaps because in the\nabsence of national distributors who\ninvest in advertising and promotion, the\norganizations that managed the release\ntended to be less efficient. Still, the find-\nings we present were unaffected. Results\nfor these additional analyses are available\nfrom the authors upon request.\n156\/ASQ, March 2008\nany of the previous three years. We also employed alterna-\ntive windows of two, four, and five years but found no signifi-\ncant differences from the results we report. Following this\ncodification procedure, we created valued yearly biadjacency\nmatrices in which edges connect vertices from different sets\nof organizations and there are no ties within any set (Borgatti\nand Everett, 1997; Asratian, Denley, and Haggkvist, 1998).\nThe cells of these matrices are valued because any producer\norganization could supply more than one film to the same\ndistributor in a given year (the element ij and the symmetric ji\nmay assume values greater than 1) and because we tracked\ndistributed movies by any pair of organizations (producer and\ndistributor) over a three-year window. We used the biadjacen-\ncy matrices to compute all actor- and aggregate-level network\nmeasures.\nOur first explanatory variable is connectivity. The most\nstraightforward indicator of network connectivity is the recip-\nrocal of the count of the number of components, i.e., the\nmaximal connected sub-graphs into which the network is dis-\naggregated (Wasserman and Faust, 1994). This components-\nbased connectivity measure reaches a maximum when the\nnumber of components is equal to 1, that is, all nodes of the\nnetwork are connected. Conversely, connectivity is minimal\nwhen every node is an isolate, and there are as many compo-\nnents as there are nodes. The limitation with this approach is\nthat it does not take into account the size of the components\n(see Borgatti, 2006). This is illustrated in the producers-dis-\ntributors network depicted in figure 1, in which circles repre-\nsent producer organizations and triangles represent distribu-\ntors. The network at time t consists of a single component\nand is therefore fully connected. Now compare the two alter-\nnative cases at time t+1. In the first case, node 6 exits the\nnetwork; in the second case, it is node 8 that leaves the net-\nwork at time t+1. Both exits fragment the network into two\ncomponents, resulting in a drop in components-based con-\nnectivity from 1 to 0.5, yet, in the first case, more pairs of\nnodes will be separated from each other.\nThis suggests an alternative approach to measuring connec-\ntivity that accounts for components\u2019 size. The approach we\nchose builds on Krackhardt\u2019s (1994) measure of connected-\nness, which simply counts the number of pairs of nodes that\nare connected to one another. Given a matrix R in which rij =\n1 if i can reach j and 0 otherwise, the measure of connectivi-\nty can be defined as follows:\n2\ni\n\u0001\nj<i\n\u0001rij \/n(n\u20131)\nKrackhardt\u2019s score provides the proportion of mutually reach-\nable pairs over the total number of reachable pairs in a fully\nconnected network. It therefore ranges from 0 to 1, with 0\nequal to no connectivity in the network, and 1 equal to maxi-\nmum connectivity. When applied to the previous example,\nthis measure returns a value of 0.44 for network A and 0.61\nfor network B, thus providing a more accurate representation\nof the difference in connectivity between the two structures.\nAnother benefit of using this measure is that it does not\n157\/ASQ, March 2008\nNetwork Ties and Legitimation\ndepend deterministically on either population density or the\nnumber of films released in any given year. In fact, unlike the\nstandard density measure (percentage of all possible ties pre-\nsent in the network), which always decreases with the num-\nber of nodes in the domain, the connectivity measure can\nchange freely, because the number of mutually reachable\npairs depends only on the topology of the network and the\nrules of attachment that underpin it. For instance, new\nentrants into the population might connect across previously\nseparate components and enhance the connectivity of the\nentire domain or choose to link to minor components or oper-\nate in isolation from the rest of the population, thus dampen-\ning the overall level of connectivity. For the same reason, the\nrelease of new films does not necessarily add to the inter-\nconnectivity of the field so long as the corresponding\nexchanges between producer and distributor organizations do\nnot span previously unconnected components of the net-\nwork. Theoretically, the connectivity measure reflects a sim-\nple yet essential enabling structural condition for achieving\nconsensus among the members of a community, i.e., the\nexistence of a relational pathway connecting as many mem-\nbers as possible. This intuition was captured well by\nMarkovsky and Lawler (1994) when they identified \u201creacha-\nbility\u201d as an essential feature of cohesion and is consistent\n158\/ASQ, March 2008\n4\n3\n62\n8\n7\n1\n9\n4\n3 5\n62\n1\n7 9\n10\n10\n5\n4\n3 5\n2\n1\n7\n8\n9\n10\nFully connected network at time t\nA) Network at time t + 1 after exit of node 6\nB) Network at time t + 1 after exit of node 8\nCircles = producer organizations\nTriangles = distributor organizations\nLines = film ties between producer and distributor organizations\nFigure 1. An illustration of network connectivity.\nwith our approach, which rests on the reachability between a\nnode and any other node in the network, either directly adja-\ncent or via a walk. Empirically, it has the notable advantage of\nmaking network size irrelevant, whereas any approach based\non volume (or density) of relations necessarily limits the abili-\nty to explore structural connectivity in large social settings\nbecause the investments required to increase density rise\nexponentially with the number of agents (Moody and White,\n2003).\nOur second independent variable is the mean level of repeat-\ned ties at the population level. Repeated ties occur when a\nproducer organization repeats its exchange of a film with a\ndistributor organization. We calculated a measure of repeated\nties for each producer organization in each year by counting\nthe average number of times the organization worked with a\ndistributor in the three-year window. We then summed these\nvalues and divided them by the total number of connected\npairs in the network. The independent variable used in the\nanalysis measures the log of the average number of times\nproducer organizations repeated collaborations with the same\ndistributors during the window period.\nOur third independent variable is audience turnover. We mea-\nsured the heterogeneity of audience members by analyzing\nthe tenure distribution and included the standard deviation of\ndistributor tenure as the measure of heterogeneity. Research\nin organizational demography often measures turnover by\nusing the coefficient of variation; however, recent method-\nological work recommends estimating heterogeneity in the\ntenure distribution using a measure of variation, like the stan-\ndard deviation, while controlling for the effect of mean tenure\n(S\u00f8rensen, 2002). The use of a single measure like the coeffi-\ncient of variation may confound the effect that the two dis-\ntinct characteristics of demographic distributions can have on\nturnover and other organizational outcomes. Therefore, when\nwe estimated the effect of tenure heterogeneity, we includ-\ned a variable that measures the mean organizational tenure\nof distributor organizations. In alternative measurements, we\ncalculated turnover as (1) the share of exits of distributor\norganizations, calculated as the ratio of the number of distrib-\nutor exits in the prior year divided by the number of distribu-\ntor organizations (oldtimer ratio) and (2) the percentage of\nnew distributor organizations that enter each year (newcomer\nratio). We expected the two alternative measurements would\ncontinue to show a positive effect on exit rates. We present\nestimations using these alternative measures as robustness\ntests in the results section.\nControls\nOur analysis included several control variables. To account for\nage dependence, we estimated a piecewise exponential\nspecification, which we describe in greater detail below. By\nincluding time-varying information on organizational size, we\ncould isolate the effects of age from size. Research on time-\nvarying size and life chances conceptualizes organizational\nsize in two ways: capacity and scale of operations. Our mea-\nsure here\u2014the logged annual volume of film production (i.e.,\na count of films released in the previous 12 months)\u2014focus-\n159\/ASQ, March 2008\nNetwork Ties and Legitimation\nes on scale. Organizations involved in more projects survived\nlonger because of their ability to diversify some of the\nproject-specific uncertainty plaguing each individual film.\nAn analysis of interdependence between populations raises\nthe issue of how to treat boundary-spanning organizations,\nnamely, film producer organizations that are vertically inte-\ngrated in distribution. The modeling of the network of rela-\ntionships between producer and distributor organizations\nimplies ignoring transactions that producers manage them-\nselves, a decision that could have influenced our theoretical\npredictions and empirical strategy. We addressed this prob-\nlematic issue in two ways: (1) by introducing a time-varying\ndichotomous measure of vertical integration, taking a value of\n1 if the production company also distributed at least one of\nits films in that year and 0 otherwise, and (2) by estimating\nmodels only for the subset of non-integrated production com-\npanies. To account for the network size of the focal organiza-\ntion, we added a measure of the log of the number of net-\nwork partners with which each producer organization\nengages in exchange every year. This variable increases\nwhenever the focal production company adds new ties to its\nnetwork. New ties in a firm\u2019s network broaden the scope of\nthe firm, thereby increasing the likelihood of obtaining new\ninformation and adding to the diversity of information to\nwhich a firm is exposed (Baum and Ingram, 1998; Beckman,\nHaunschild, and Phillips, 2004).2 Another network control at\nthe firm level is the membership in the main component, i.e.,\nconnection to the largest weakly connected network sub-\ngraph. Firms that are part of the main component are more\nlikely to face converging expectations from their audiences\nand to tap into rich information spillovers. As suggested by\nOwen-Smith and Powell (2004), membership in the main\ncomponent offers a channel to the widest range of informa-\ntion flows while increasing a firm\u2019s visibility in labor markets\nand in informal networks.\nAdditional controls include repeated ties measured at the\ndyadic level in two ways. First, we calculated repeated ties\nbetween each producer organization and distributor organiza-\ntion in any given year as the logged average number of times\nthat an organization repeated collaboration with the same dis-\ntributors during the observation window. As organizations\nrepeat their collaborations, several advantages develop that\nhave a positive impact on survival, including mutual trust\n(Granovetter, 1973), norms of reciprocity (Larson, 1992), and\njoint problem solving arrangements (Uzzi, 1996). Moreover,\nreduced exit rates may result from buyers offering better\nterms of trade and allocating more resources to transactions\nembedded within existing suppliers, thereby contributing to\nthe advantages of such exchange patterns. Sorenson and\nWaguespack (2006) showed that motion picture distributor\norganizations exhibit a preference for carrying films involving\nkey personnel with whom they have had prior exchange rela-\ntions and that they tend to favor these films in the allocation\nof resources like opening dates and marketing investments.\nTo control for such dynamics, we measured repeated ties\nbetween individual producers and distributor organizations.\nThis control also helps us account for the fact that a non-\n2\nA frequently used proxy for information\ndiversity is Burt\u2019s (1992) structural holes\nmeasure, which captures the extent to\nwhich an actor\u2019s contacts are themselves\nconnected to one another. This measure\nis less appropriate here, as the bipartite\nnature of the network implies a restriction\non the mixing, such that ties only cross\nclasses. By implication, in this network,\nno connection between the ego\u2019s alters\ncan ever occur.\n160\/ASQ, March 2008\ntrivial number of production companies are one-off ventures,\ncoming into existence only for the realization of one or a few\nmovies. This intrinsic feature of the industry would suggest\nthat the appropriate level of analysis is individual networks\nrather than organizational ones. The measure at the individual\nlevel mitigates this concern. It should be emphasized, how-\never, that it was not until the late 1950s that short-term pro-\njects and individual networks became pervasive features of\nthe American film industry (Faulkner and Anderson, 1987; De\nVany, 2004). This potential source of bias is therefore proba-\nbly more relevant in subsequent years than in the period cov-\nered by our study. Finally, to control for survival-related\neffects of niche width (Dobrev, Kim, and Hannan, 2001), we\nanalyzed film production across genre segments and included\na measure of the log of the number of film genres in which\neach producer organization operates every year. Finally, when\nwe tested for the effect of audience turnover, we also includ-\ned a variable measuring the mean size of distributor organiza-\ntions. We calculated this variable as the average number of\nfilms released by distributors to separate size-dependent\neffects in the audience, such as the exercise of market\npower in buyer-supplier relationships, from the hypothesized\nimpact of audience turnover. We also introduced several\naggregate-level variables to control for changes in carrying\ncapacity and industry structure. The first of these controls is\npopulation density. We measured density by counting the\nnumber of film producer organizations operating each year.\nBased on the knowledge that production in the motion pic-\nture industry requires an average of 12 months of pre-entry\nactivity, we updated density and other covariates annually\nusing 12-month moving averages. Following other recent\nstudies (Ruef, 2004; Lomi, Larsen, and Freeman, 2005), we\nused moving averages to adjust for inertia in the rate at\nwhich firms respond to changes in population density and\nenvironmental characteristics. The use of moving averages\naccounts for the fact that organizational vital rates do not\nreflect events that occurred precisely 12 months earlier and\nalso reduces the effect of measurement error in our record-\ning of the timing of events. Because exit rates are influenced\nby the effects of population density at the time of founding\nand the resulting liability of resource scarcity (Carroll and Han-\nnan, 1989), we included density delay as an additional con-\ntrol. To capture community-level effects, we included a vari-\nable measuring the density of distributor organizations.\nFinally, because connectivity may capture industry size\neffects rather than network structure, we included a variable\nmeasuring industry mass (Barnett, 1997), calculated as the\ntotal number of films made each year.\nOver the period studied, motion pictures went from being\nthe primary form of visual entertainment (1912\u20131946) to\nbeing an alternative to other media, particularly television\n(1947\u20131970). We therefore entered weekly attendance in\nterms of millions of admissions per year to measure carrying\ncapacity in the models.3 In addition, we included television\npenetration to address potential symbiotic or competitive\nrelationships between film and television. We introduced a\nmeasure of market concentration to control for potential bar-\nriers to entry and resource partitioning (Carroll, 1985; Mezias\n3\nData on film attendance are incomplete\nbefore 1918. Since the introduction of a\nwar tax on movie consumption, however,\nattendance has been systematically\nreported. Some sources provide informa-\ntion for earlier years, e.g., Donahue (1987)\nfor 1911, which we used to interpolate\nthe missing data. The findings presented\nin the paper were analogous when we\nuse number of theaters, which also con-\ntained interpolations. We employed alter-\nnative variables that can be used to mea-\nsure carrying capacity. For example, we\ncollected data on annual recreational\nexpenditures (i.e., money spent in recre-\national activities) in the U.S. over the\nstudy period from the Historical Statistics\nof the United States, Colonial Times to\n1970, Bicentennial Edition (Bureau of the\nCensus, 2003). The main findings we\nreport hold across these measurements,\nand the alternative variables did not pro-\nvide better-fitting specifications.\n161\/ASQ, March 2008\nNetwork Ties and Legitimation\nand Mezias, 2000). We utilized a Hirschman-Herfindahl index,\nobtained by squaring and then summing the market share of\neach production company based on the number of films pro-\nduced. We included two dichotomous variables to control for\nperiod effects. One variable addresses the potential effects\nassociated with the establishment of the Hollywood Studio-\nsystem period (RKO, the youngest of the \u201cmajors,\u201d began\nproducing films in 1928); our measure takes a value of 1\nbetween 1928 and 1947 and 0 otherwise. Historical analyses\nof the industry suggest that total integration might have\nreduced the viability of smaller or more specialized producers\nbecause the majors controlled access to a significant propor-\ntion of first-run theaters (Conant, 1960; Balio, 1985). The\nother variable (post-Paramount period) addresses the poten-\ntial impact of antitrust actions on the structure of the indus-\ntry. In 1948, a government suit against the eight largest firms\n(United States vs. Paramount Pictures, 334 U.S. 131) culmi-\nnated in a Supreme Court decision that imposed divestiture\nof the exhibition chains owned by the majors. Observers sub-\nsequently have argued that production activities have\nbecome more and more organized around short-term, decen-\ntralized projects (Balio, 1985; Caves, 2000). The variable\ntakes the value of 1 from 1948 to 1970 and 0 otherwise.\nTable 1 reports descriptive statistics and the correlation\nmatrix for the variables used in the regressions.\nModel\nWe modeled the exit of producer organizations using r(t), the\ninstantaneous risk of exiting. This hazard rate is defined as\nthe limiting probability of exiting between t and t + \u2206t, given\nthat the organization was operating at t, calculated over \u2206t:\n\u00b5(t) = lim\u2206t\u21920 Pr(t < T \u0001 t + \u2206t \uf8e6 T > t) \/ \u2206t\nParametric estimates of the hazard rate require assumptions\nabout the effect of time (in these models, age) on failure. We\nadopted the piecewise exponential specification, which\nallows the base rate of exit to vary flexibly with organizational\nage. This approach splits time into pieces according to the\ntenure of the organization. The base failure rate remains con-\nstant within each time piece, though these base rates can\nvary across pieces. As a result, the piecewise model does\nnot require any strong assumption about the exact form of\nduration dependence (for more information on this approach,\nsee Barron, West, and Hannan, 1994). Our exploratory\nresearch on the population found the best fit using five break\npoints, at 1, 2, 4, 10, and 20 years (intervals open on the\nright). The first segment includes events occurring within the\nfirst year of tenure in the industry and cases that enter and\nexit within the same year. The second segment includes\nevents that occur within the first and second years of tenure,\nand so forth. The form of the model is\nr(t) = e\u0002Xe\u0003l if t \u2208 Il,\n162\/ASQ, March 2008\nwhere X is the vector of covariates, \u0002 is the associated vec-\ntor of coefficients, and \u0003l is the constant coefficient associat-\ned with the lth age period. Life histories of each production\ncompany were broken into one-year spells to incorporate\ntime-varying covariates. The reported results are maximum-\nlikelihood estimates.\nRESULTS\nTables 2\u20134 report the results from the regression analysis. In\naddition to likelihood ratio tests used to compare nested\nmodels, the tables refer to Akaike\u2019s information criterion (AIC)\nas a likelihood-based measure of overall model fit to compare\ncompeting, including non-nested, models. The conventional\ninterpretation of AIC is as an estimate of the loss of precision\n(increase in information) that results when \u03b8x, the maximum\nlikelihood estimate, is substituted for the true parametric\nvalue, \u03b8t, in the likelihood function. Thus, by selecting the\nmodel with minimum AIC, the estimated loss of precision is\nminimized. Smaller values of AIC indicate better fitting\nmodels.\n163\/ASQ, March 2008\nNetwork Ties and Legitimation\nTable 1\nDescriptive Statistics and Correlation Matrix\nVariable Mean S.D. .1 .2 .3 .4 .5 .6 .7 .8 .9\nOrganizational tenure 3.94 7.15\n01.

The baseline shows that film pro-\nducer organizations experience decreasing exit rates over\ntheir tenure. This result supports the idea that new organiza-\ntions have more difficulty in being accepted in the audience-\ncandidate network. Yet the extremely high exit rate associat-\ned with the first year may stem from a specific feature of the\nmovie industry: individuals frequently organize to produce a\nsingle motion picture and then disband. Alternatively, this lia-\nbility may reflect the risky nature of movie-making, whereby\nthe vast majority of products fail to attract sufficient moviego-\ners to cover costs. With respect to scale, increasing size\nappears to reduce market risks effectively, and all models\nreveal negative size-dependence. In separate analyses, we\nincluded relative size in place of or in addition to absolute size\nand obtained equivalent results. Given that previous analyses\nof the industry did not typically find substantial cost savings\nassociated with simultaneously producing multiple movies,\nthese effects likely stem from risk diversification rather than\neconomies of scale. Market concentration does not signifi-\ncantly influence exit in any of the models; hence, cost advan-\ntages do not appear to push smaller production companies\nout of the market. We separately analyzed the historical evo-\nlution of concentration in production and found that it does\nnot interact with time trends, again in opposition to resource\npartitioning logic. Integration seems to insulate producers\nfrom resource dependence on distributors (Negro and Soren-\nson, 2006). Spanning across genres increases exit rates, sug-\ngesting that the ability of the external audiences to perceive\nand identify an organization\u2019s fit with established market posi-\ntions decreases with niche width (Hsu, 2006).\nAmong the period effects, the studio-system indicator\nexhibits a negative and significant coefficient, suggesting that\nperformance of production companies actually improved dur-\ning the years of dominance by the Hollywood majors. The\npost-Paramount variable shows a positive and weakly (p <\n.10) significant coefficient, reflecting a riskier environment.\nTelevision penetration produces a positive and weakly signifi-\ncant effect on exit rates, suggesting the existence of compe-\ntition between media. As illustrated by model 1, film produc-\ner organizations are affected by density-dependent U-shaped\ndynamics, with density first reducing and then increasing exit\nrates. Density delay has the predicted positive and significant\neffect, while distributor density shows a negative and signifi-\ncant effect on the production companies\u2019 exit rates, suggest-\ning the presence of symbiosis provided by complementary\ndifferences between audience members and candidate orga-\nnizations (Audia, Freeman, and Reynolds, 2006). Mass has a\npositive effect on exit, indicating that increasing aggregate\nsize generates more intense competition and consequently\nlowers survival. At the dyadic level, we find that repeated\nties have a negative effect on exit rates. The effect is signifi-\ncant for both the producer-organization and the individual-\nproducer dyads with the distributor organization. Although\nfilm production can have a transient nature, our observation\nof distinct effects by individual producer and organizational\nnetworks suggests that the latter is the appropriate level for\nour analysis of exit rates.

Membership in the main component\nshows a negative effect, hinting at the benefits of being part\nof the larger element of the network. We performed a likeli-\nhood ratio (LR) test between the specification in model 1 and\na reduced specification with only ecological variables, omit-\nting number of exchange partners, repeated ties between\ndistributor and producer organizations, repeated ties between\ndistributor organizations and individual producers, and mem-\nbership in the main component. The test reveals that the\nmodel that contains network variables explains producer exit\nrates much better that the simple ecological model (\u00042[L1 \u2013\nLreduced] = 60.7, p < .001 for 4 d.f.). The AIC values (32542.6\nvs. 32595.3) indicate the same tendency.\nModel 2 adds the first network measure, connectivity: As\nexpected, the effect on exit rates is negative and statistically\nsignificant. At its mean value, network connectivity reduces\nproducer exits by about 38.9 percent. As indicated by the LR\ntest (\u00042[L2 \u2013 L1] = 39.4, p < .001 for 1 d.f.) and the AIC, this\nspecification improves over the baseline model. We thus find\nsupport for hypothesis 1, that increasing reachability decreas-\nes the exit of producer organizations. Figure 2 presents the\ngraphical representation of the effect of network connectivity\non the multiplier of the exit rate.\nModel 3 includes the second network measure, mean\nrepeated ties. As predicted, the variable has a negative and\nsignificant effect on producers\u2019 exit. A one-standard-deviation\nincrease in repeated interactions reduces producer exits by\nabout 2.5 percent. Net of the influence of repeated ties at\nthe dyadic level, the effect of mean repeated ties is signifi-\ncant. In unreported estimations, we replaced the mean repe-\ntition variable with the median and continued to find a nega-\ntive and significant effect. The specification of model 3 has a\nbetter fit than the baseline (\u00042[L3 \u2013 L1] = 9.5, p < .001 for 1\nd.f., and AIC is 32535.1) and supports hypothesis 2, that\nincreasing repeated interactions between audience members\nand candidates reduce the latter\u2019s exit. Figure 3 depicts the\neffect of mean repeated ties on the multiplier of the exit rate.\n166\/ASQ, March 2008\nFigure 2.

This specification adds a term\ncapturing the effect of mean distributor size to control for\nsize-related processes such as buyer\u2019s market power. As we\nhypothesized, turnover has a positive and significant effect\non exit. At its mean value, audience turnover increases pro-\nducers\u2019 exit rates by about 21.3 percent. The specification of\nmodel 4 has a better fit than the baseline (\u00042[L4 \u2013 L1] = 80.8,\np < .001 for 3 d.f., and AIC is 32467.8). This supports hypoth-\nesis 3. A graphical illustration of the effect of audience\nturnover on the multiplier of the exit rate is shown in\nfigure 4.\nModel 5 jointly tests the effects of the three explanatory vari-\nables and confirms previous results. Overall, this specification\nshows better fit than the intermediate models, providing sup-\nport for hypotheses 1, 2, and 3: the likelihood ratio test\nshows model 5 is an improvement over any of the previous\nspecifications as indicated by the LR tests (\u00042[L5 \u2013 L1] =\n109.7, p < .001 for 5 d.f.; \u00042[L5 \u2013 L2] = 70.3, p < .001 for 4\nd.f.; \u00042[L5 \u2013 L3] = 100.3, p < .001 for 4 d.f.; \u0004\n2[L5 \u2013 L4] = 28.9,\np < .001 for 2 d.f.) and the AIC value (32442.9) as well.\nFigure 5 provides visual evidence of the effect of network\n167\/ASQ, March 2008\nNetwork Ties and Legitimation\nFigure 3.

Given that organizations have a\nfinite capacity for engagement, paying attention to a broader,\nmore diverse set of audiences means less attention paid to\nestablishing and communicating a clear fit to each (Hsu,\n2006). One implication is that increases in niche width must\ndecrease the level of an organization\u2019s engagement across its\ndiverse positions, resulting in lowered audience appeal\nacross these positions. Targeting a broad niche makes it diffi-\ncult for organizations to clearly establish their fit with target-\ned taste positions, and broader niches present patterns of\nfeatures that lack conformity to audience-relevant schemas\n(Hannan, P\u00f3los, and Carroll, 2007). If so, this lack of confor-\nmity limits legitimation via a reduction in consensus and\nentails a higher hazard of exit. Genres reflect sets of posi-\ntions that are relevant for producers and audiences alike. Hsu\n(2006) found that films that target more genres generally\nattract a larger proportion of audiences. At the same time,\nhowever, these films diminish the audience\u2019s ability to clearly\nperceive and identify an organization\u2019s fit within established\nmarket positions. In our context, we expect that lack of con-\nformity associated with producer organizations that operate\nin broader genre niches will increase penalties under condi-\ntions of greater connectivity, greater repeated interactions,\nand lower turnover. Model 7 includes interaction effects with\nniche width and shows significant effects, as expected.\nMoreover, model 8, in table 4 considers one other factor that\nwould lead to consensus, the role of homogeneity in the\naudience. We expected higher homogeneity among audience\nmembers to be more congenial to the development of con-\nsensus. Model 8 includes as a measure of homogeneity the\naverage niche overlap across genres among distributor orga-\nnizations. Though increasing overlap among distributors can\nincrease distributors\u2019 exit due to crowding processes, the\nimpact on producer organizations can be beneficial: with\nmore competitive overlap among audience members, there\nshould be more agreement about the features candidates\nought to present. This effect shows net of the density of dis-\ntributor organizations. Consistent with this logic, we find that\n170\/ASQ, March 2008\nTable 3 (continued)\nPiecewise Exponential Regression Models of Exit Rates of Feature Film\nProducer Organizations\u2014Robustness Checks*\nVariable Model 6 Model 7\nAudience turnover 0.379\u2022\u2022\u2022 0.341\u2022\u2022\u2022\n(0.061) (0.051)\nNiche width \u0002 Connectivity 0.331\u2022\u2022\n(0.147)\nNiche width \u0002 Mean repeated ties 0.108\u2022\u2022\n(0.045)\nNiche width \u0002 Audience turnover \u20130.080\u2022\u2022\u2022\n(0.021)\nAudience overlap \u20130.332\u2022\u2022\u2022\n(0.053)\nLog-likelihood \u201316166.217 \u201316193.42\nChi-square vs. null 7238.46\u2022\u2022\u2022 7186.71\u2022\u2022\u2022\nChi-square vs. model 1 158.62\u2022\u2022\u2022 109.72\u2022\u2022\u2022\nAIC 32394.43 32405.81\n\u2022 p < .10; \u2022\u2022 p < .05; \u2022\u2022\u2022 p < .01.\n* Standard errors are in parentheses.

Due to the use of a\nthree-year window in analyzing ties, observations for the peri-\nod 1912\u20131914 could have biased our results. Model 8 checks\nsensitivity to this time window, estimating exit rates by omit-\nting the first three years of observation, and shows our\nresults are unaffected by the estimations made for the abbre-\nviated observation period. Model 9 replicates the full model\nby restricting the analysis to non-integrated production com-\npanies. Previous results are unchanged. In the film industry,\nproducer organizations may be created for the production of\na single film. Lack of information in the data sources on orga-\nnizational goals prevented us from distinguishing between\norganizations that did not make a second film because the\nfirst one was not successful and organizations that purposely\nwere designed for single productions. Model 10 attempts to\naddress this issue by including a dummy variable to control\nfor producer organizations that made more than one film.\nOrganizations that made at least two films have lower exit\nrates, but we continue to find support for our hypotheses.\nModel 11 includes a measure of cumulative size. We find\nthat controlling for the number of previous films made over\nthe life of the organization does not affect producer exit\u2014\ncumulative size probably causes the lack of significance of\nthe first time piece. Model 12 addresses the concern that\nlegitimation is better represented as a time-varying function\n(Hannan, 1997). We included a variable measuring industry\nage to control for time trends. This specification indicates\nthat industry age reduces exit, but it leaves our previous find-\nings unaffected. Models 13 and 14 provide alternative specifi-\ncations to network connectivity.

Consistent with hypothesis 1, this variable has a nega-\ntive and significant effect on exit, suggesting that increasing\n(or decreasing) connectivity in the communication network\nbetween audience and candidates\u2014as indicated by lower (or\nhigher) values of C\u2014enhances (or harms) candidates\u2019 sur-\nvival. Model 14 replaces the measure of network connectivity\nwith a variable gauging the average degree of the network. A\nhigher degree of vertices suggests a more connected net-\nwork because vertices have more ties. Accordingly, we used\nthe average degree of all vertices as an alternative proxy for\nthe interconnectivity of the domain. The effect on exit is neg-\native and significant, in line with our original measure, but\ncompared with these alternative specifications, our chosen\nmeasure produces better fit, as suggested by the LR tests\nand AIC values of models 13 and 14 vs. model 5. The next\ntwo specifications present alternative measurements of the\naudience turnover variable and combine a measure of popula-\ntion dynamics with one of density. Traditionally, density\ndependence processes are alternatives to population dynam-\nics (Baum and Shipilov, 2006). While density dependence\nfocuses on levels of density itself, population dynamics focus\non how current founding and failure rates are related to\nchanges in density (Tucker et al., 1988). Recent trends in eco-\nlogical studies have abandoned analysis of population dynam-\nics effects, but some authors argue that the issue deserves\nfurther examination (Baum and Shipilov, 2006). Our alterna-\ntive measurement revisits prior work on population dynamics\nby creating a direct link between transitory flows and the\ndensity of audience members but uses audience rather than\npopulation dynamics and considers an interpretation of the\nturnover process that is distinct from resource availability or\nthe use of vicarious information (Kalnins, Swaminathan, and\nMitchell, 2006). Model 15 replaces the variables measuring\nthe age of distributor organizations with the lagged propor-\ntion of distributor organizations that exit the network. More\nmember exits induce higher audience discontinuity and in\nturn increase exit rates. Consistent with this prediction,\nturnover still has a positive and significant effect on produc-\ners\u2019 exit rates. Model 16 presents another measurement of\nturnover, the proportion of new entrants in the audience.\nIncreasing entry is expected to intensify discontinuity in audi-\nences. In accordance, an increasing rate of entry into the\naudience increases the exit of producer organizations, but the\nobserved effects of audience turnover may instead reflect\nturnover in the focal population. To control for this, models 15\nand 16 add the number of prior exits and entries of producer\norganizations, respectively, and leave our main findings unaf-\nfected. In unreported analyses, we added the effect of com-\npetitive intensity measured by age-size interactions (Barnett,\n1997), but the results did not modify the findings we present.\nAs firms exit the population, their ties to distributors dissolve,\nthus altering the properties of the network to which they\nbelong. To partially account for this endogenous process of\nnetwork causation in separate analyses, we estimated our\nfull model using multiple time frames for the connectivity\nmeasure. We employed two-, three- and four-year lags, and\nthe results were robust to all such specifications.\n174\/ASQ, March 2008\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nThe macro changes that produce legitimation are just starting\nto receive systematic analysis (Hannan, P\u00f3los, and Carroll,\n2007: 298). Institutional scholars and organizational ecologists\nhave recently begun to converge on the idea that legitimacy\noriginates from consensus among certain agents (an audi-\nence) on which features and behaviors of an organization (a\ncandidate) should be viewed as appropriate and desirable\nwithin a widespread system of social codes. An audience-\nbased theory of legitimation posits that various social audi-\nences develop expectations about what organizations can or\nshould do and accordingly evaluate organizational action. Can-\ndidate organizations that pass the code test are legitimated in\nthe social environment. One of the consequences is that\nthey enjoy greater survival.\nTwo central but undeveloped features of this theory concern\nhow the audience is structured and evolves in tandem with\nthe organizations it scrutinizes and how interactions between\naudiences and candidates shape the formation of consensus\naround codes (Hannan, P\u00f3los, and Carroll, 2007: 302\u2013303).\nThis study examines three main conditions under which audi-\nences reach and maintain consensus: (1) network connectivi-\nty, which facilitates the transmission of social norms about\nappropriate behavior and signals membership acceptance cri-\nteria, (2) tie repetition, which allows audiences to reinforce\ninformed opinions about candidates\u2019 conformity to expecta-\ntions; and (3) audience turnover, which affects the stability of\nthe application of social codes, thereby increasing candidates\u2019\nuncertainty about default codes. In the context of the U.S.\nfilm industry, we analyzed the exchange ties between feature\nfilm producer and distributor organizations. We considered\ndistributor organizations as audience members for the pro-\nducer organizations, seeking to release their films and found\nthat the first two conditions increase producers\u2019 survival in\nthe market, while the third reduces it.\nOur analysis of patterns of exchange between feature film\nproducer and distributor organizations offers evidence that\nthe formation and operation of social codes depends on the\nnetwork connecting organizational populations and their audi-\nences. This has an important implication for ecological theory.\nFirst, legitimation is a process driven not only by numerical\nproliferation (or density) of organizations; its roots are also to\nbe found in the interactions among these organizations.\nMoreover, legitimation must not be considered static; it has a\ndynamic nature. Current ecological theory considers legitima-\ntion a process that takes place during a population\u2019s early his-\ntory. Secured once and for all during a population\u2019s youth,\nlegitimation tends to be inert and becomes increasingly\n\u201csticky\u201d (Hannan, 1997). Our analysis shows that the\nprocess of legitimation does not end with the crystallization\nof codes during the emergence of the organizational form.\nLegitimacy can be assessed at different levels and on differ-\nent dimensions (Ruef and Scott, 1998). During the early life\nof a population, the legitimation process mainly assesses the\nlegitimacy of a new organizational form, which the candi-\ndates are responsible for imprinting according to audiences\u2019\n175\/ASQ, March 2008\nNetwork Ties and Legitimation\nexpectations (Perretti, Negro, and Lomi, 2008). Once an orga-\nnizational form is established, the legitimation process shifts\nto a different level and mainly assesses the legitimacy of the\ncandidates to obtain resources from the social environment.\nEven if the organizational form is established, the codes that\naudiences develop to assess candidates\u2019 claims to existing\nresources may change without replacing the existing form. A\nfilm producer organization that was once granted resources\nin the 1930s probably would not in the 1960s, not necessarily\nbecause the organizational form or the product features were\nradically different (a movie was still a movie, projected in\nlarge-screen theaters, with actors, directors, etc.), but\nbecause the codes about what a producer should be had\nchanged. At this level, legitimacy refers to a laborious\nprocess in constant development. Also, while existing\naccounts of the legitimation process focus on direct contact\namong audience members, we show that social codes can\ndevelop via contact with candidate organizations. In this\nsense, an audience-based interpretation of legitimation inte-\ngrates with research on interorganizational networks indicat-\ning that social codes can develop and transfer in a mediated\nway (Romo and Schwartz, 1995; Uzzi, 1999; Zuckerman,\n1999, 2003; Phillips and Zuckerman, 2001).\nOur study has further ramifications for ecological theory.\nFirst, it adds to research on community ecology (Ruef, 2000;\nS\u00f8rensen, 2004), whose studies mainly focus on density-\nbased measures of resource flows between forms of organi-\nzations. Although this literature has stressed the importance\nof looking at the web of relations within and across commu-\nnities\u2019 members (e.g., Wade, 1995), the structural and behav-\nioral characteristics of this network have not been explicitly\nexamined. Our findings highlight the presence of processes\nthat link interdependent populations and have effects on vital\nrates that are distinct from density, namely, the structure of\nthe exchange networks between buyer and supplier organiza-\ntions. Focusing on the communication network between\norganizational populations and their audiences and, in particu-\nlar, the conditions fostering the formation and diffusion of\nconsensus, we shed light on the process by which standards\nlike technical design can become taken for granted.\nSecond, the use of ecological models has attracted interest\nas well as criticism. Baum and Powell (1995) have argued\nthat legitimation is a process only weakly related to ecologi-\ncal measures like density and that changes in density are\nproxies for other processes, such as the evolution of a popu-\nlation\u2019s interdependencies with its environment. Baum and\nOliver (1992) used similar arguments to justify the lack of\nsupport for density dependence in the population of day care\ncenters in Toronto: after controlling for the relational density\nof institutional linkages between day care centers and gov-\nernmental agencies, initial increases in population density\nshowed only competitive effects. Baum and Oliver (1992)\nattributed this finding to the population\u2019s increasing embed-\ndedness in its environment and concluded that relational den-\nsity is a more direct specification of legitimating effects. In\nthe absence of left-truncated schemes, our examination of\npopulation density and relational embeddedness lends sup-\n176\/ASQ, March 2008\nport to both density-based and non-density-based mecha-\nnisms driving the legitimation process (Sine, Haveman, and\nTolbert, 2005).\nThird, some organizational populations show complex evolu-\ntionary trajectories in which a decline in density is followed\nby a resurgence. Ecologists have developed various explana-\ntions\u2014including density delay, time-dependent heterogeneity,\nand resource partitioning\u2014for what is considered an anomaly\nrelative to predictions of the density-dependence model. The\npopulation of feature film producer organizations experienced\nsuch a resurgence. According to resource partitioning, when\nthe number of organizations declines, the market share held\nby a few firms often increases. In a highly concentrated\nindustry, specialist organizations often find small pockets of\nresources on which they can exist (Carroll, 1985). This, in\nturn, leads to lower mortality and, eventually, to a larger pop-\nulation. Our study suggests another mechanism for resur-\ngence based on the structural and relational characteristics of\ninterorganizational ties. This mechanism has the advantage of\nallowing reversibility without imposing strict time-dependent\nassumptions (Hannan, 1997).\nAt a broader level, our study also contributes to the dialogue\nbetween ecological and social network research on organiza-\ntions. On the one hand, ecology informs network studies by\ndemonstrating that embeddedness in social contexts has\nmeaning beyond direct ties and can be a function of mem-\nbership in an ecological community (Hannan, P\u00f3los, and Car-\nroll, 2007). On the other hand, network studies inform ecolo-\ngy by bringing evidence that the system of connections to\nthe environment can influence organizational dynamics\nbeyond the discrete segmentation of populations. The net-\nwork therefore represents a context, not a mere juxtaposition\nof ties (White, 1992).\nDespite support for the hypotheses, this study has important\nlimitations that in turn suggest directions for future work.\nFirst, our study examines the conditions under which consen-\nsus is more likely to be reached, strengthened, and pre-\nserved, but without directly measuring consensus. We\ninferred the existence of agreement within the audience on\nthe candidates to accept or to exclude if the identified condi-\ntions were satisfied altogether. Also, we did not measure\ncodes directly, even though the qualitative evidence present-\ned in the paper provides a glimpse into what those codes\nlooked like in our setting during the study period and how\nthey shaped agents\u2019 behavior (Bordwell, Staiger, and Thomp-\nson, 1985). More fine-grained data on the relationships\nbetween producer and distributor organizations, such as data\non contractual deals, public discourse, and actual resource\nflows from distributors to producers, but also a different\nresearch design, perhaps a combination of textual and histori-\ncal analysis, would make it possible to overcome some of\nthe limitations of the study. Second, questions about the gen-\neralizability of our findings can only be answered by examin-\ning other contexts. Organizations in the film industry operate\nin a context fraught with great uncertainties, both on the sup-\nply and demand side (Faulkner and Anderson, 1987). This\nresults in self-reinforcing dynamics of embeddedness in\n177\/ASQ, March 2008\nNetwork Ties and Legitimation\nAcheson, J.

Repeated ties therefore may be a\nmore cogent factor in explaining life chances here than in\nother contexts. The film industry has also witnessed shifts in\nthe structure of market exchanges. Horizontal ties between\nproducers have increased substantially since the 1970s, and\nan analysis extending to more recent periods could examine\nhorizontal rather than vertical ties. Third, the study examines\nonly a simple set of network characteristics. The choice of\nconnectivity, repeated ties, and turnover in the buyer network\ndirectly reflects our interest in studying the influence of orga-\nnizational network structures beyond the effect of ecological\nmechanisms. Future studies might address alternative\nexchange forms and their potential effects. Fourth, in this\nstudy, we did not analyze the joint impact of the network\nmechanisms that influence audience consensus. Exploratory\nanalyses suggest that connectivity and repeated ties moder-\nate the deleterious effect of audience turnover on exit. High-\ner embeddedness can indeed mitigate the loss of specific\nexchange partners but maintain the structure of roles and\nidentities. Examining such interaction effects represents an\ninteresting avenue for future research. Yet these findings also\nrequire additional empirical validation, and the underlying the-\noretical mechanisms have to be investigated more deeply. In\nthis context, future research could also investigate if network\nstructure interacts with density dependence. A study that\nconnects the analysis of network ties with ecological dynam-\nics may shed light on relevant open problems, for example,\nthe fact that density dependence assumed that legitimation\neffects are symmetric across the two sides of the peak in\nthe density distribution. These represent fruitful areas for fur-\nther investigation that we hope will contribute to a better\nunderstanding of the complex and fundamental relationships\nlinking organizations to their environment.\nREFERENCES\nBerelson, B., P.
