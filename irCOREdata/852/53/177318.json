Combustion, however, is and is likely to remain for \nthe foreseeable future, the most important energy source for heat, electrical power and \nespecially for transportation. In technical combustion systems the chemical energy of fossil \nfuels such as coal, crude oil and natural gas is converted into heat through oxidation with \noxygen from air. However, fossil fuel resources are limited and alternatives like biofuels [1] \nor novel technologies such as fuel cells [2] are not yet able to meet the demand. Consequently, \nfor a sustainable use of fossil fuels it is desirable to further improve the efficiency, \nmaintainability and reliability of existing combustion devices. Achieving such improvements \ndepends upon an improved understanding of the fundamental combustion chemistry as well as \noptimized engineering design. Further motivation for improved understanding of combustion \nand increased device efficiency is the need to reduce the environmental impact of emissions \nfrom fossil fuel combustion. Apart from \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d such as carbon dioxide these \nemissions include nitric oxides (NOx), sulphuric oxides (SOx), harmful organic compounds \n(e.g. aromatic hydrocarbons) and particulate matter or soot which have harmful effects on \nhuman health. \nIn general, combustion is a rather complex phenomenon where chemical reactions, fluid \ndynamics as well as heat and mass transfer processes are involved and, moreover, interact \nwith each other. In combustion chemistry it is usually not sufficient just to consider a global \nchemical reaction equation involving only the reactants (i.e. fuel and oxidizer), and the \nproducts, (e.g. carbon dioxide and water). To achieve deeper understanding, the entire \nreaction mechanism involving numerous reaction paths and a large number of intermediate \ntrace species, as well as the local gas temperature and pressure, must be taken into account [3, \n4]. \n 6\nKnowledge of the spatially and temporally resolved concentration of different flame \nintermediate species together with their temperature is of great value and allows insight into \nthe individual chemical processes taking place. Several molecules are typically utilized as \nindicators for different flame regions. For instance, formaldehyde (HCHO) is formed and \nsubsequently consumed again in an early stage of the chemical conversion of hydrocarbons \n[5]. Therefore, the presence of HCHO indicates the region in a flame where the temperature is \nrelatively low and the fuel molecules are decomposing [6]. In contrast, the formyl radical \n(HCO) is generated in a reaction where a major part of the chemical energy is released as heat \n[7]. Therefore HCO indicates the location of the actual flame front in hydrocarbon \ncombustion [8, 9]. A further interesting intermediate species is hydroxyl (OH) which is \nformed in the high temperature region. Since it has a relatively long lifetime OH exists in a \nwide flame area and to a certain extent in the exhaust gas as well [10]. It is therefore \ncommonly employed to study flame structures and to determine flame surface density [11]. \nThe CH radical, like HCO is present in a thin layer of the reaction zone, is often employed as \na flame front marker as well, because it exhibits advantageous properties for spectroscopic \ndetection [12] in comparison with HCO [8]. Moreover, by detecting several intermediate \nspecies such as CH plus OH, that are characteristic for different flame regions, additional \ninformation on the combustion and flow processes in a flame can be obtained [11, 13]. Other \nflame intermediates exert influence on the formation of pollutants. For instance, CH, CN and \nHCN are strongly involved in the formation of nitric oxides through the prompt NO \nmechanism [14]. C2, acetylene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are believed to \nbe intermediates in the generation of soot particles and aggregates [15]. \nThe molecules mentioned are typically present at an extremely low number density. For the \nexperimentalist this presents the challenge to develop highly sensitive diagnostic tools to \nmeasure concentration and temperature with high spatial and temporal resolution. In \nparticular, challenges arise from experimental conditions and limitations imposed by the \n 7\nhostile environments of combusting media. Measurements in flames need to be non-intrusive \nin order to avoid disturbing the system. Optical methods are inherently non-intrusive and \nnowadays laser-based techniques are commonly employed [16]. The use of optical emissions \nhowever may be influenced by chemiluminescence or thermal radiation from soot particles. \nFurther interferences may arise from elastically scattered laser light by Rayleigh and Mie \nscattering. Such scattering interferences are not species specific and can have a several orders \nof magnitude higher intensity than the actual signal of interest [16]. Moreover, inside a flame \nstrong gradients of temperature and density lead to local changes of the refractive index which \nmay influence the propagation of laser beams (beam steering) and signal photons [17]. Finally, \nthe experimental environment itself can also be challenging. In particular, technical \ncombustion systems and devices such as gas turbine combustors and internal combustion \nengines provide limited optical access to the flame region [18, 19] and, as a consequence, \noptical arrangements with low numerical aperture must be employed. \nA wide variety of diagnostic techniques have been developed to detect flame intermediates. In \nthis article we review the development and use of nonlinear optical spectroscopic techniques \nfor this purpose. Conventional optical diagnostic methods using linear optical processes such \nas fluorescence or Raman scattering usually involve detection of an incoherent emission of \nlight that radiates into all directions. Nonlinear optical processes, on the other hand, can \nprovide signals in the form of coherent, laser-like beams. Such signal beams have particular \nadvantages in combustion diagnostics where the region to be investigated is usually highly \nluminous and may offer very limited optical access for signal collection. Nonlinear methods \noffer signals with high directionality giving better discrimination against background flame \nemission, high spatial resolution and high selectivity of species and quantum state together \nwith suppression of molecular interferences.  \nThe paper is arranged as follows: Firstly, a brief overview of conventional methods for trace \nspecies detection is given together with a discussion of their limitations. Secondly, in section \n 8\n3, the fundamentals of nonlinear optics are introduced, specifically the general class of \nprocesses known as four-wave mixing. In section 4 an outline of the theoretical basis of third-\norder nonlinear optical processes illustrated by the case of DFWM is presented. The \nmathematical subsections may be skipped by the non-expert but the introductory section is \nuseful to give a general idea of the underlying physics of FWM processes. The properties of \nsignals generated by these FWM processes are highlighted with their implications for \nexperimental combustion diagnostics. This is followed by detailed reviews of the commonly \nemployed techniques of degenerate four-wave mixing (DFWM), coherent anti-Stokes Raman \nscattering (CARS), laser-induced grating spectroscopy (LIGS) and polarization spectroscopy \n(PS). Further related methods are then outlined together with a brief review of practical \nconsiderations and fields currently under development. \n 9\n2 Conventional detection methods for intermediate species \nFlame intermediates play a crucial role in combustion chemistry. Therefore a detailed \nunderstanding of combustion requires knowledge of their production, location, influence and \nalso their destruction with good time and space resolution. Consequently many approaches to \ntheir detection and measurement have been devised. For the sake of completeness a brief \noverview over the conventional methods will be given in the following but not discussed in \ndetail. \nIn general, all techniques can be classified into two groups \u2013 those that do not use lasers and \nthose that do. \n2.1 Techniques without lasers \nThe oldest, but still common, method to study combustion intermediates is the spectroscopy \nof natural flame emissions often referred to as chemiluminescence. Such emissions mainly \noccur from molecular radicals in excited electronic states and the first experiments were \nreported as early as 1857 by Swan who investigated and identified chemiluminescence of C2 \nin a candle flame [20]. Today this method is a standard in almost every combustion laboratory \nbecause of its experimental simplicity. Its main drawback is that it is a line-of-sight method \nand so inherently lacks spatial resolution. Employing appropriate signal collection optics [21], \nhowever, or by using tomography methods [22] a limited degree of spatial resolution can be \nobtained. In addition, the passive nature of the technique limits the number of detectable \nspecies to those emitting light in some part of the optically detectable spectrum. Furthermore, \nthe emission from different species can overlap spectrally making detailed analysis difficult. \nMany of the non-laser methods involve sampling with physical probes. For this reason these \ntechniques are intrusive and may influence the local combustion by disturbing the fluid flow, \nby local cooling or by catalytic surface effects etc. Nevertheless they have contributed \nsignificantly to a fundamental understanding of flame chemistry. Electron spin resonance \n 10\n(ESR) spectrometry has mainly been used for measurements of atomic species like N, O and \nH [23]. Molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS), another sampling method of great \nimportance, has been employed for many years to study flames and the progress in this area \nhas been reviewed in detail by Biordi in 1977 [24] and more recently by Hansen et al. [25]. \nThe third method to be mentioned is gas chromatography (GC) [26]. The techniques based on \nflame-sampling are typically employed to investigate stationary laminar flames at low \npressure. A detailed discussion can be found in reference [25] and the references therein. \n2.2 Techniques employing lasers \nLaser-based methods have been developed and used since the 1960s and they are nowadays \nthe most common tools for detecting flame intermediates and determination of their \nconcentration and flame temperature. One of the most simple and direct methods is absorption \nof laser light. (For the sake of completeness it should be mentioned that absorption of light \nfrom incoherent sources is also an option). Absorption techniques are comparatively easy to \napply and allow a straightforward data evaluation using the Beer-Lambert law which relates \nthe transmittance or absorbance of the sample to the concentration of the absorbing species \n(The transmittance or absorbance is found simply from the ratio of the transmitted to incident \nintensity of the light at a wavelength corresponding to a known transition in the absorbing \nspecies.). When temporal resolution is not an issue the use of tuneable diode laser absorption \nspectroscopy (TDLAS) can be an option [27]. This technique uses light from a continuous \nwave diode laser which is passed through the flame. The transmittance is monitored while the \nlaser wavelength is scanned over a certain spectral range. Diode lasers are available for \nlimited ranges of wavelengths in the near- and mid-infrared region where most of the \nintermediate species of interest have \u201cfingerprint\u201d spectra arising from ro-vibrational \ntransitions or their overtone and combination bands. On the one hand this represents a clear \nopportunity to exploit these absorption features for detection, but, on the other hand, the \n 11\nmultitude of absorption lines from carbon dioxide and water leads to interferences that \ncomplicate the signal analysis. The most readily available and reliable diode lasers also tend \nto emit in the overtone regions where the absorption cross-sections are typically several orders \nof magnitude weaker than in the fundamental bands in the mid-infrared. Future progress in \nnew devices such as room temperature quantum cascade lasers, which operate in the mid- to \nfar-infrared, may address this issue. \nThe main limitation of TDLAS and related techniques is the lack of temporal and spatial \nresolution. When high temporal resolution is required techniques employing pulsed laser \nsources are the methods of choice. However, for trace species detection, in particular when \nthe species of interest have short lifetimes and so exist only in a thin layer of the reaction zone, \nthe use of conventional laser absorption spectroscopy may not provide sufficient sensitivity. \nFor this reason an enhancement of the sensitivity is required. This is often done using multi-\npass arrangements, which means that the laser beam is reflected into the flame many times. \nThis approach however leads to a loss of spatial resolution. For these reasons TDLAS has \nlimitations in combustion diagnostics. Nonetheless even in some technical systems useful \ninformation can be obtained by exploiting strong absorption transitions in selected species for \ncombustion relevant measurements. Multiplexing of multiple diode lasers and tomographic \nmethods to achieve spatial resolution can provide multiple species and multiple parameter \nmeasurements [28]. In this context, the development of hyperspectral sources for absorption \nspectroscopy is providing a further tool for diagnostics of combustion environments [29-31].  \nIn order to overcome the limitation of weak absorption several practical approaches have been \ndeveloped to increase the effective absorption path using cavity enhancement. In this context \nintra-cavity laser absorption spectroscopy (ICLAS) has been used to enhance weak absorption \nsignals. In an ICLAS experiment the absorber (e.g. a gas cell) is positioned inside the cavity \nof a broad-band laser. The principle of ICLAS is based on the strong sensitivity of the laser \nemission to the presence of a spectrally selective absorber in the cavity. By recording the \n 12\nspectrally resolved laser emission the absorption spectrum can be obtained and quantitative \ninformation can be extracted. This approach has been developed in the early 1970s and a \nnumber of review articles have summarized theoretical aspects and experimental studies, see \ne.g. refs [32, 33] and the references therein. Analysis of ICLAS signals is complicated by the \nnon-linearity of the signal dependence on the combined effect of an absorber and an amplifier \nin the laser cavity. A powerful method that avoids this complication is cavity ringdown \nspectroscopy (CRDS) in which the absorbing species is placed in a passive cavity external to \nthe laser [34]. In CRDS a small fraction of the beam of a pulsed laser is coupled into an \noptical cavity built from two highly reflecting mirrors. The intensity of light emerging from \nthe cavity decays exponentially as a fraction of the re-circulating light pulse leaks through one \nof the mirrors. The decay time of the signal decreases in the presence of an absorber in the \ncavity. Thus the variation in decay time as the laser light wavelength is tuned provides a \nspectral signature of the absorbing species. The details have been discussed in the literature \n[34]. \nOne of the most severe drawbacks of absorption techniques arises from their being line-of-\nsight methods which lack spatial resolution along the propagation direction. Therefore the \napplicability of such diagnostics is limited especially in technical combustion systems where \nheterogeneous density and absorber concentration conditions typically apply. Furthermore the \npresence of soot particles may significantly affect the measurement of the light transmittance. \nParticulates such as soot act as a black-body absorber and so absorption occurs over a wide \nspectral range. In addition, particles scatter light by Mie and Rayleigh scattering, depending \non the particle size which leads to attenuation in a non-species specific way. \n \nA number of other methods are based on absorption of laser radiation but utilize different \nmeasurement strategies to achieve spatially resolved detection. Examples of such techniques \nare photo-thermal and photo-acoustic spectroscopy. When laser radiation is absorbed by the \n 13\nspecies of interest the energy from the excited molecules is subsequently dissipated by \ncollisions. As a consequence the local temperature increases, and the local density and \ncomplex refractive index change accordingly. The local deviation from equilibrium conditions \neventually results in an acoustic wave which may be detected with a microphone. The spatial \nresolution of such techniques is again limited. To provide some spatial resolution optical \ndetection is used by crossing a second laser beam with the excitation laser at the position of \ninterest. The deflection of the probe laser beam can be monitored by a position-sensitive \ndetector yielding an estimate for the released energy and thereby for the concentration of the \nabsorbing species [35]. \n \nThe most common method for minor species detection in flames is laser-induced fluorescence \n(LIF) [36]. LIF can be understood as an absorption process followed by spontaneous emission \nof radiation (fluorescence) during the transition back to a lower electronic state, i.e. usually \nthe electronic ground state. The intensity of the emitted fluorescence is used as a measure of \nthe population density of the absorbing species. Species selectivity is provided by tuning the \nincident laser to resonances in the molecular absorber. Molecular and atomic flame radicals or \npollutant species at the parts-per-million (ppm) or sub-ppm level can be probed by single \nphoton absorption processes, e.g., OH, CH, NH, NO or CN. Species such as O, H, N, or CO \nmay be detected using two-photon absorption (two-photon LIF). Quantitative concentration \nmeasurements are feasible but rendered difficult by collisionally induced inter- or intra-\nmolecular energy transfer processes. These quenching processes modify the fluorescence \nintensity by depopulating the excited molecular states. Since the quenching occurs often at \nrates that are unknown, or that vary spatially according to the (usually unknown) local gas \ncomposition and temperature, the LIF intensity cannot be interpreted unambiguously in terms \nof species concentration. \n 14\nA LIF spectrum obtained by frequency scanning the laser across numerous absorption \nfeatures yields a measure of the initial quantum state population for each transition. Using \nBoltzmann statistics the relative intensities of the lines may be used to infer the equilibrium \ntemperature. The fundamentals and applications of LIF in the field of combustion research \nhave been reviewed in numerous books and articles [16, 36-38]. \nOne strong feature of LIF is that, by forming the exciting laser beam into a sheet, it can easily \nbe used to obtain the 2D distribution of the species of interest [16]. The fluorescence intensity \nin the plane of the sheet \u2013 planar laser induced fluorescence, PLIF \u2013 can potentially be \ninterpreted in terms of the species distribution. Moreover, combining PLIF with another \nmethod simultaneously can provide a large amount of information (for example: PLIF of \nanother species or other methods such as laser Rayleigh scattering for thermometry or particle \nimaging velocimetry for the flow field) [11]. \nA very similar method to LIF from the experimental viewpoint is ultraviolet resonance Raman \nscattering. In this case the naturally weak Raman scattering effect utilizing an inelastic \ninteraction between the molecules and laser light [39] is enhanced by tuning the excitation \nlaser to a resonance transition of the molecule of interest. This has been demonstrated, for \nexample, for vibrational spectroscopy of allyl radicals [40]. Geier et al. utilized combined \nsignals from laser-induced fluorescence and near-resonance enhanced Raman scattering to \ndetect silicon monoxide in a silica-generating flame [41]. Getty et al. demonstrated detection \nof benzene and trichloroethylene in methane\/air flames using resonance Raman spectroscopy \n[42]. \n \nFinally the technique of resonantly enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI) deserves to be \nmentioned owing to its high sensitivity. In the first step of the REMPI process the molecule of \ninterest is excited by single or multi-photon absorption. A further photon leads to ionization \ndirectly from the excited state. By introducing an anode into the flame the electrons ejected \n 15\nfrom the molecule can be detected [43]. REMPI is a good alternative to detect species that can \nabsorb radiation but do not fluoresce and hence are poor candidates for LIF measurements. \nHowever, since it uses a physical probe in the flame it can not be considered a non-intrusive \ntechnique and therefore its application is limited. \n \nTo summarize this section, there are many techniques available for the detection of \ncombustion intermediate species. All of them however have drawbacks that make their \napplication under certain circumstances or in special environments difficult or even \nimpossible. The methods that require probe sampling (e.g., mass spectrometry or gas \nchromatography) or inserting a physical detector (REMPI) may affect the flame significantly \nand hence they are not non-intrusive. Chemiluminescence as a passive process is limited to \nspecies that are present in excited states and emit radiation. Absorption methods (including \nTDLAS, ICLAS and CRDS) are line-of-sight techniques and provide limited spatial \nresolution. In contrast, the linear laser techniques of LIF and PLIF are relatively easy to \nimplement and can deliver species-specific, spatially- and temporally-resolved information. \nLimitations arise from the spontaneous nature of the emitted radiation. The fluorescence \nsignal is emitted into a 4\u03c0 solid angle and so signal collection requires good optical access \nand large numerical apertures. This is a particular problem in technically relevant combustion \nsystems where only limited optical access to the measurement volume may be available. Most \nseriously for quantitative measurements the LIF or PLIF signal is compromised by unknown \nlocal quenching effects that are particularly deleterious at high pressures. In conclusion, there \nis a strong need for further diagnostic techniques that overcome the limitations that afflict \nconventional and linear laser techniques. In this paper the particular properties of nonlinear \noptical processes are presented as potential and actual solutions to some of these problems. \n \n 16\n3 Nonlinear optical spectroscopy \n3.1 Nonlinear optical methods \nDiagnostic methods that use the light scattered or absorbed by the gases undergoing \ncombustion have the great advantage that they can be sensitive to trace quantities of the \nspecies being detected. Furthermore the chemical processes involved in the combustion are \nnot disturbed by the measurement of the light signal. There are however some major \ndisadvantages. For the conventional methods outlined in the previous section these include \nlack of spatial resolution in absorption methods and processes that interfere with, obscure or \nmodify the intensity of the signal in emission or scattering methods so that it becomes \ndifficult to relate the recorded intensity to the combustion parameter being measured. In \nparticular, the natural light emitted by flames or scattering of the incident laser light by soot \nparticles can mask the weak signals arising from laser induced fluorescence or Rayleigh and \nRaman scattering. Perhaps the most difficult problem facing LIF methods is the effect of \nmolecular collisions that quench the fluorescence in a way that is often difficult or impossible \nto quantify. All of these methods can be categorised as \u201clinear optical methods\u201d since the \nintensity of the signals are linearly proportional to the intensity of the input light. In order to \novercome some of these problems \u201cnon-linear optical methods\u201d have been developed. The \nsignal intensities in such methods are proportional to the second, third or higher power of the \nincident laser intensity \u2013 hence the signal is non-linearly proportional to the input intensity. \nResonant four-wave mixing is, from the viewpoint of optical diagnostics, an important sub-set \nof nonlinear optical methods. \nThe important aspect however is not the nonlinearity but the coherence property of the \ngenerated light forming the signal. In the case of linear scattering methods such as LIF the \nsignal is the result of a spontaneous emission by excited molecules leading to incoherent light \ni.e. the phase of the emitted light is random and the direction of the emission is also randomly \n 17\ndistributed over a 4\u03c0 solid angle. In contrast the signals emitted by nonlinear optical processes \nsuch as resonant four-wave mixing are coherent, the phase of the light is not random but \nlinked to that of the incoming coherent laser light. Consequently the emitted light is \ndirectional and propagates as a laser-like beam with low divergence. This coherent property \nof the signal gives these methods an immediate advantage over the linear optical methods that \nspread the signal over a sphere so that the intensity decays with distance according to the \ninverse square law. Practically all of the laser-like nonlinear signal can be detected and at a \nlong distance away from the region of generation by which point the background luminosity \nor scattering from particles may be reduced to negligible proportions. In addition resonant \nfour-wave mixing signals are sensitive to even trace quantities of the species being detected. \nThe problem of collisional quenching can also be considerably reduced or eliminated in some \ncircumstances. This can be done if the nonlinear signal is generated faster than the collisions \ncan dephase the driven oscillations or by using ultra-short laser pulses in which the interaction \nis completed before any collisions occur.  \nThe list of advantages provided by resonant four-wave mixing methods include: coherent \n(laser-like) signal leading to high signal-to-noise ratios, reduced sensitivity to collisional \nquenching, time and space resolution, sensitivity to trace quantities, species and state \nselectivity using high spectral resolution afforded by narrow linewidth lasers and reduction of \nDoppler broadening. The nonlinear interactions probe molecular excitations giving \nmicroscopic information that may be used to derive thermodynamic parameters such as \nspecies concentrations and temperatures. In addition the interaction of the excited molecules \nwith the surrounding gas leads to changes in the bulk behaviour of the medium giving \ninformation on the macroscopic properties such as pressure, gas velocity and mass flow as \nwell as temperature.  \nAlthough resonant four-wave mixing methods can address some of the problems encountered \nby linear techniques they also have their own peculiar disadvantages. The nonlinear optical \n 18\nprocess is inherently more complicated and, in general, requires more complex analysis. In \naddition the signals are sometimes affected by interference from other nonlinear processes \noccurring simultaneously. Practical disadvantages include the need for high power lasers, \nmore complex optical arrangements and alignment involving difficulties of optical access for \nthe multiple beams required. Strategies have been and are being developed to mitigate these \ndisadvantages both theoretically and practically e.g. provision of easy-to-run analysis \nsoftware and reliable optical design to ease alignment problems.  \nIn order to understand how the particular advantages and disadvantages of resonant four-wave \nmixing techniques arise we need to understand the underlying physical mechanisms involved. \nThis is the subject of the following section. \n3.2 The physics of four-wave mixing \nA comprehensive treatment of the fundamental principles of four-wave mixing can be found \nin a number of textbooks [16, 44, 45]. In particular the excellent texts by Boyd [44] and \nEckbreth [16] respectively provide detailed treatments of the fundamental nonlinear optics \nand a more simplified introduction in the context of applications in combustion. In this section \nwe outline the underlying physics and how the signal strengths may be calculated to form the \nbasis for measurements in diagnostic applications. We begin by reminding ourselves of the \nbasic physics of linear optics. In this case the interaction of light with matter is described by \nthe simple equation: \n)()()( \u03c9\u03c9\u03c7\u03b5\u03c9 EP o=  (3.1)\nPhysically this represents the generation of a polarization i.e. a distribution of electric dipoles, \n)(\u03c9P , whose magnitude is proportional to the amplitude of the incoming electric field of the \nlight wave, )(\u03c9E . The constant of proportionality )(\u03c9\u03c7  is the susceptibility and o\u03b5  is the \npermittivity of free space. The susceptibility )(\u03c9\u03c7 is a function of the light wave frequency, \n 19\n\u03c9 , and becomes large when this corresponds to a natural resonance frequency in the atoms or \nmolecules of the medium i.e. the frequency at which the atom or molecule will make a \ntransition from the ground to an excited state. )(\u03c9\u03c7  is a complex function such that the \nimaginary part describes the absorption of the light by the atom and the real part describes the \ndispersion i.e. the change in phase velocity suffered by the light as it passes through the \nmedium. The susceptibility )(\u03c9\u03c7  thus defines the (complex) refractive index of the medium. \nThe oscillating dipole represented by )(\u03c9P  radiates electromagnetic energy i.e. some of the \nincoming light is scattered by the atoms or molecules. The polarization thus acts like a source \nterm in Maxwell\u2019s equations describing the propagation of the light in the medium. The \npropagation of the light \u2013 its growth or decay \u2013 is therefore described by the wave equation \nderived from Maxwell\u2019s equations for the fields. \n( ) ( ) ( )2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2 1\nt\nP\nt\nE\nc\nE o \u2202\n\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202=\u2207 \u03c9\u03bc\u03c9\u03c9  (3.2)\nThe wave arising from )(\u03c9P  is, according to equation 3.1, linearly proportional to the \namplitude of the incoming wave )(\u03c9E  \u2013 hence this describes linear optics. \n \nExactly the same physics is involved in a nonlinear optical process. The expression for the \npolarization induced by an incoming field given in equation 3.1 may be generalized to include \nmore than one field \u2013 or the same field more than once i.e. higher powers of the field \namplitudes )( iiE \u03c9 : \n...)()()()()()()()()()( 332211\n)3(\n2211\n)2(\n111\n)1( +++= \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c7\u03b5\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c7\u03b5\u03c9\u03c9\u03c7\u03b5\u03c9 EEEEEEP ooo (3.3)\nThe total induced polarization now has a nonlinear dependence on the incoming field \namplitudes e.g. in the simple case where there is only one incident field, 21 \u03c9\u03c9 = , including \n 20\nonly the second term in the expansion gives a nonlinear polarization that has a component \ndepending quadratically as well as one depending linearly on the incoming field amplitude. \nThe coefficients of the higher order terms )()( \u03c9\u03c7 i  decrease by many orders of magnitude \nfrom one order to the next. Therefore the higher order terms giving the nonlinearity are \nusually negligibly small and most optical phenomena are very accurately linear. The situation \nchanges however if either the field amplitudes )( iiE \u03c9  become much larger than usual or the \nsusceptibility coefficients )()( i\ni \u03c9\u03c7  become large. The electric field in bright sunlight is about \n600 Vm-1 whereas the field in a laser may be many orders of magnitude larger e.g. the field in \na laser beam of intensity ~1 MWcm-2 is ~106 Vm-1. So nonlinear effects are often found when \nintense laser light passes through a medium. The susceptibility coefficients, which vary with \nfrequency, are also orders of magnitude larger than usual at frequencies corresponding to \nresonance transitions in the molecules of the medium. It is this frequency dependence that \nallows nonlinear optical processes to be used for spectroscopy. Thus nonlinear laser \nspectroscopy uses both means of enhancing a nonlinear signal by using intense electric fields \nand tuning the frequency to resonance in some molecular species in the medium. \n \nFor reasons of symmetry the second order term in )()2( \u03c9\u03c7  is zero in isotropic media such as \ngases and so the first nonlinear term that can contribute to the nonlinear polarization in such \nmedia is )()3( \u03c9\u03c7 , the third order susceptibility. We can now consider how this term leads to \nthe phenomenon of four-wave mixing. \nConsidering only the third order term the nonlinear polarization is: \n)()()()()( )3( kkjjiiijklolNL EEEP \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c7\u03b5\u03c9 =  (3.4)\n 21\nThis general expression shows that a polarization may be created oscillating at frequency l\u03c9  \nin response to driving fields at three different frequencies i\u03c9 , j\u03c9 and k\u03c9 . One way of \nthinking about this is to think of the field )( kkE \u03c9  acting on a medium whose refractive index \nis being modified by the action of the other two fields )( iiE \u03c9  and )( jjE \u03c9 : \n)()]()()([)( )3( kkjjiiijklolNL EEEP \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c7\u03b5\u03c9 =  (3.5)\nThe action of the first two fields is to cause the refractive index to vary in time at the optical \nfrequencies i\u03c9  and j\u03c9 . This leads to a beating of the three fields involved. Since the three \nterms can be taken in any sequence the polarization frequency l\u03c9  can take a range of values \ngiven by the sums and differences of the incoming frequencies: \nkjil \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 \u00b1\u00b1=  (3.6)\nThus three waves incident on a medium which responds nonlinearly produce a fourth wave \nradiated by the induced nonlinear polarization. This is the origin of four-wave mixing. The \ncondition represented by equation 3.6 is simply the conservation of energy of the incoming \nand generated photons. \nOnce the fourth, or signal, wave is generated by the radiating polarization it can take part in \nthe general mixing process so we do have four waves mixing. How much of this fourth wave \nis produced and measured will depend on the intensity of the incident three waves, the value \nof the nonlinear susceptibility at the relevant frequency, and, importantly, the geometry of the \npropagating waves defined by the respective wave vectors )(\u03c9ik\nr\n. The geometry is important \nbecause the induced molecular dipoles will have to form a phased array if they are to generate \na propagating wave i.e. they radiate a propagating wave only in a direction where the phase of \n 22\nthe dipoles is such that their radiation constructively interferes with the travelling signal wave. \nThe wave vectors must satisfy the following condition to achieve this phase matching: \nkjil kkkk\nrrrr \u00b1\u00b1=  (3.7)\nEquation 3.7 then represents the conservation of momentum of the photons. It can be seen \nfrom equation 3.6 that four-wave mixing encompasses a wide range of possible signal \ngenerating processes. The particular process that is observed will depend on the choice of the \nthree input frequencies and the geometrical arrangement i.e. phase matching of the beams. \nThe most important processes for our purposes are the following: \n11114 \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 =+\u2212=  Degenerate Four Wave Mixing, DFWM \n1214 \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 +\u2212=   Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering, CARS \nVariations on these basic processes include Two-Colour Four Wave Mixing, TC-FWM, \nwhere 22114 \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 =+\u2212= , and Electronically Resonantly Enhanced CARS or ERE-CARS \nwhere 3214 \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 +\u2212= . In addition Laser Induced Grating Spectroscopy, LIGS, and also \nPolarization Spectroscopy, PS, can be treated as four-wave mixing processes. The molecular \ntransitions involved in all these processes described by equation 3.6 are shown schematically \nin figure 3.1. The allowed quantum states in the molecules are represented by solid lines \nwhereas the dashed lines represent virtual states. The transitions induced by the interacting \nphotons are represented by vertical arrows and show schematically the energy conservation \nrepresented by equation 3.6. \n \n 23\n \nFigure 3.1: Transitions between allowed molecular states involved in resonant four-wave mixing processes. The \nlower solid line represents the ground state and upper solid lines and dashed lines represent allowed excited and \nvirtual states respectively. The transitions induced by the interacting photons are represented by vertical or \ndiagonal arrows. The wavy arrow in (e) represents a non-radiative or quenching transition. The circulating \nsymbols in (f) indicate circular polarization of the incident photons and the double headed arrows indicate two \northogonal linear polarization states of the photons. In this example \u03c3+ light induces \u0394m = +1 transitions leading \nto depopulation of the lower degenerate mJ substates. In each diagram the three arrows on the left represent \ninput photons and the right hand arrow (grey) represents the signal photon. \n \nThe geometrical arrangements that satisfy the momentum conservation represented by \nequation 3.7 are shown in figure 3.2 for the processes in which phase matching is a critical \naspect viz. DFWM, TC-FWM, LIGS, CARS and ERE-CARS. In these processes the physical \ninteraction can be represented by the generation of a grating structure and subsequent \nscattering of one of the waves off this structure to yield the signal. Two of the input beams are \ndesignated as \u201cpump beams\u201d and the other is designated the \u201cprobe beam\u201d. In the cases of \nDFWM and TC-FWM two of the degenerate frequency beams interfere to produce a spatially \nvarying intensity pattern or grating which is \u201cwritten\u201d into the medium by the nonlinear \n 24\nresponse of the molecules. This provides a spatially varying refractive index grating that \nscatters some of the radiation from the third input beam to give the signal beam. Since the \ninterfering beams have the same frequency the induced grating is stationary in space. \nTwo geometrical arrangements are possible to achieve the phase matching condition as shown \nfor the case of DFWM. The first case consists of two counter-propagating pump beams and \nthe probe of wavelength \u03bb intersecting at some arbitrary angle \u03b8. The spacing of the \ninterference pattern, \u039b, and hence of the grating will be: \n( )2sin2 \u03b8\n\u03bb=\u039b  (3.8)\nIn this arrangement the momentum of the pump beams sums to zero so the momentum of the \nprobe and signal must then also sum to zero to conserve momentum. The result is that in this \n\u201cBackward Pump Geometry\u201d, BPG, the signal is emitted counter-propagating to the probe \nand is automatically phase matched. The angle \u03b8 therefore can have any value. In practice \nhowever \u03b8 is kept small otherwise the grating spacing \u039b is so small that thermal motion of the \nmolecules washes out the grating so rapidly that the scattering efficiency is dramatically \nreduced. When the incident laser linewidth is narrower than the Doppler width of the \nenhancing molecular transition only those molecules that have no velocity component along \nthe input laser beams can interact with all three beams. Moving molecules \u201csee\u201d the incident \nlaser light Doppler shifted out of resonance and so they do not contribute to the signal. This \nproperty can be very useful for spectroscopy in flames where Doppler broadening is the main \nlimitation to spectral resolution. \nThe second possible geometry has the two pumps and probe beam propagating all in the \nforward direction but at a small angle to each other. Phase matching again is easily achieved \nby ensuring the angles between the beams are equal for the degenerate frequency case or have \nthe required value to ensure the transverse momentum adds to zero in the case of TC-FWM. \n 25\nThis \u201cForward Pump Geometry\u201d, FPG, has the advantage that all the molecules can contribute \nto the signal, not just those with zero velocity relative to the beams as in the BPG resulting in \nstronger signals. \nSince the grating in the case of DFWM and TC-FWM is composed of a spatial variation of \npopulation of excited molecular states it will decay rapidly owing to spontaneous emission or \ncollision effects which may both dephase the dipoles or de-excite them by inelastic scattering \ni.e. quenching. The FWM interaction returns the molecules to the ground state. Thus energy is \nsimply redistributed from the three input fields to the signal field and the outgoing pump and \nprobe fields. If quenching collisions occur, however, some of the energy is prevented from \nbeing re-coupled to the fields. This energy deficit appears as heat in the medium \u2013 inelastic \ncollisions transfer energy to translational (kinetic) and internal energy of the colliding \nmolecules. The result is that the same grating pattern is produced as a local variation in \ntemperature and density. This is a bulk property of the gas and decays much more slowly than \nthe molecular population grating. This thermal grating persists after the exciting lasers have \ndisappeared and so signals can be produced by scattering also after the excitation has ceased. \nThe strength of the scattered signal may be used to probe the dynamics of the thermal grating \ndecay. This laser induced grating scattering requires that the probe beam is incident on the \ngrating at the Bragg angle to produce the diffracted signal beam. The angle of incidence must \ntherefore be chosen to match the probe wavelength to the grating spacing. \n \n 26\n \nFigure 3.2: Grating structures induced in four-wave mixing processes: (a) DFWM with Backward Pump \nGeometry, BPG, (b) DFWM with Forward Pump Geometry, FPG, (c) LIGS and (d) CARS. In ERE-CARS the \npump and probe waves will have different frequency. The arrangements of arrows indicate approximately the \ngeometry of the interacting beams to achieve phase matching. \n \nIn the case of CARS, a grating is produced by interference of one pump beam and a second \nbeam often referred to as Stokes beam, so called because it is shifted in frequency by the \n\u201cStokes shift\u201d corresponding to a molecular vibration or rotation frequency observed in the \nnormal Raman effect. The interference pattern produced by two beams of different frequency \nis not stationary in space and moves at a speed determined by the frequency difference \n 27\nbetween the pump and Stokes beam. Consequently the grating associated with the interference \npattern is moving and so the beam that is scattered off the moving grating will be Doppler \nshifted. In CARS the \u201cprobe\u201d beam is usually at the same frequency as the pump and the \nscattered beam is Doppler shifted upwards by an amount equal to the Stokes shift. Thus the \nsignal beam is increased in frequency to that of the Anti-Stokes wave in Raman scattering. \nThe signal is coherent owing to the phase imposed by the coherent excitation beams and so \nthe overall process is termed Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering, CARS. As can be seen \nin figure 3.1(c) the interaction involves two successive two-photon transitions via virtual states. \nThe process is therefore inherently weak since two-photon transitions have much lower \nprobability than single photon resonant transitions. This problem is addressed by using two \npumps of different frequency chosen to coincide with resonant single photon electronic \ntransitions. Each of the photon interactions is therefore resonantly enhanced leading to \nElectronically Resonantly Enhanced CARS or ERE-CARS. \nThe remaining technique, Polarization Spectroscopy, PS, can be thought of as a four-wave \nmixing process in the following way. A probe beam is linearly polarized by passing through a \npolarizer prism and then through a medium and is then blocked by an orthogonally aligned \nlinear polarizer i.e. an analyzer. In the absence of any other beams the medium presents a \nlinear isotropic refractive index to the probe. As a consequence the crossed polarizer and \nanalyzer result in a zero intensity reaching the detector. When, however, a strong, circularly \npolarized, pump beam interacts with the medium optical pumping creates an unequal \npopulation in the degenerate magnetic sub-states of the molecules making the medium \noptically active i.e. it presents a different refractive index value to right and left circularly \npolarized light. So when the pump is present the plane of polarization of the probe beam is \nrotated resulting in some transmission through the analyzer. The optical pumping arises from \ninteraction with two waves from the pump beam. The probe provides the third wave that \ninteracts with the optically pumped molecules to create a phased array of dipoles with \n 28\npolarization rotated relative to that of the probe. This phased array, set up by the propagating \nprobe, radiates the signal \u2013 the fourth wave \u2013 that is transmitted by the analyzer. Owing to the \nvector properties of the pump and probe fields the effect is reduced if the crossing angle \nincreases and falls to zero at 90o. As can be seen in figure 3.3 the pump can propagate either in \nthe forward or backward direction relative to the probe and since the molecules must interact \nwith both beams the backward geometry provides a \u201cDoppler-free\u201d signal in a similar way to \nDFWM with BPG. In practice different combinations of circular and linear polarizations for \npump and probe can be chosen that will interact with the molecules in different ways \naccording to the transition selection rules governing the resonant transition being excited. \n \n \nFigure 3.3: Polarization Spectroscopy (a) Backward Pump Geometry, BPG and (b) Forward Pump Geometry, \nFPG. In both cases the pump beams are shown circularly polarized in the same sense. The component of the \nsignal beam that is orthogonal to the probe polarization is shown. \n \n3.3 The properties of four-wave mixing \nHaving outlined the basic physics underlying four-wave mixing we are now in a position to \nunderstand how the advantageous properties of these nonlinear processes arise. Firstly, with \nthe exception of LIGS, the coherent nature of the signals arises from the polarization that is \ndriven by the three input waves: two pumps and one probe. The induced polarization creates a \nphased array of oscillators that radiates a wave that grows in amplitude along a direction \ndetermined by the phase matching geometry, or the direction of the probe beam in PS. The \nsignal wave is therefore emitted as a coherent laser-like beam. Such a signal beam is then \n 29\neasily spatially filtered from isotropically scattered laser light or flame luminescence leading \nto high signal-to-noise ratios. In the case of LIGS the coherence of the signal arises from \nBragg scattering off a macroscopic grating structure created by interference of two coherent \nbeams. \nThe phase matching geometry also allows the interaction to be generated from a small volume \ndefined by the intersection of the pump and probe beams. This crossed-beam arrangement \nautomatically provides good spatial resolution. Although PS does not require phase matching \nit shares the property of having good spatial resolution by virtue of using crossed pump and \nprobe beams. The volume of the interaction region can be typically tens to hundreds of \nmicrons in transverse extent by about one millimeter in length. Time resolution is determined \nby the duration of the incident laser pulses which can range from tens of nanoseconds to a few \nfemtoseconds using Q-switched and mode-locked lasers respectively. In principle, pulses of \nthe order of microseconds in duration can also be used (provided that the intensity is sufficient \nfor generating nonlinear optical signals) and these are still fast on the time scale of many \ncombustion phenomena of interest. \nThe strength of the signal is determined by the population of the initial quantum state, NJ, and \nthe value of the molecular third order susceptibility )()3( \u03c9\u03c7 . The amplitude of the induced \npolarization and hence of the radiated signal wave will therefore also be proportional to the \npopulation. The signal intensity therefore scales with the square of the population density, NJ \nand so the signal intensity gives a measure of the concentration of the resonantly interacting \nspecies. \nThe frequency dependence of )()3( \u03c9\u03c7  is responsible for the enhancement of the interaction \nwhen the input frequencies correspond to resonant transitions in the molecules. The signal \nstrength will be many orders of magnitude larger on-resonance than off-resonance and this \nthen gives the process spectroscopic selectivity. Particular species and specific quantum states \n 30\ncan be excited selectively by choosing the input frequencies and using narrow-bandwidth \nlasers. Thus species present at trace levels of the order of ppm can be readily detected against \na background of other majority species. This is important in detecting transient or radical \nspecies involved in combustion chemistry and the spatial resolution allows them to be \ndetected even within narrow reaction zones of flames. Further properties such as the reduced \nsensitivity to molecular collision effects and the derivation of thermodynamic parameters of \ninterest in combustion depend on the specific form of )()3( \u03c9\u03c7  for each process and will be \nconsidered in the following sections. \n3.4 Experimental considerations and data analysis \nThe need for high power in the input beams has been noted but \u201cHow high does the power \nneed to be?\u201d The normal refractive index responsible for linear optics arises because all the \nmolecules are in their ground state. So an approximate guide as to what power is needed is \ngiven by the power needed to significantly perturb this population. A quantitative guide to the \ndegree to which the population is changed is known as \u201csaturation\u201d. The medium is said to be \nsaturated when the populations of the ground and excited states are equal. The intensity of \nlight needed to drive the populations into this condition is known as the \u201csaturation intensity\u201d. \nIn practice it is possible to detect nonlinear effects even when the degree of excitation is \nseveral orders of magnitude smaller than this level. Since excited molecules will relax to the \nground state in a time \u03c4, the fluorescence lifetime, we require a photon of the appropriate \nenergy, \u03c9h , to fall into the cross-sectional area of the molecule, \u03c3, at a rate given by 1\/\u03c4 . \nThis power will also have to be contained in a spectral width determined approximately by the \nlinewidth, \u0394\u03c9, of the resonance transition. The required spectral power density, or saturation \nintensity, Isat, is then given by: \n 31\n\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\n\u03c9\n\u0394\u2248\nh\nsatI  (3.9)\nTypical values for a molecular transition in the optical region of the spectrum lead to a \nsaturation intensity of the order of 1 MWcm-2cm-1. This can be readily obtained from a pulsed \nlaser providing around 0.1 mJ in a 10 ns pulse in a beam of cross-section 0.1 cm2 and a \nlinewidth of around 0.1 cm-1. In practice pulse energies down to a few microjoules can be \nused with focused beams of good quality i.e. single transverse mode or approximately \nGaussian profiles. In many cases it is desirable to focus the input pump and probe beams to \ndiameters of order 10 - 100 \u03bcm in order to obtain maximum spatial resolution. In other cases, \nhowever, a small interaction volume may limit the precision of the measurement. Specifically \nin the case of Laser Induced Thermal Gratings diffusion of the thermal energy out of the \ninteraction region leads to a more rapid decay of the signal and limits the precision of \nparameters derived from the time behaviour of the signal. \nThe linewidth of most high power pulsed lasers is usually of the order 0.01 \u2013 0.1 cm-1 which \nis well-matched to the transition linewidths. If higher spectral resolution is required then a \nsingle longitudinal mode laser will be needed with a linewidth of the order of 0.001 cm-1 that \nwill be limited by the Fourier transform of the temporal pulse envelope. For broadband or \nmultiplex spectroscopy, of course, a wide laser bandwidth will be used but in this case it is \nstill important to maintain the required spectral power density. \nResonant enhancement of the four-wave mixing signal is achieved usually by scanning the \nfrequency (or wavelength) of a narrow-bandwidth laser on to the molecular transitions. In this \ncase the signal is usually detected using a photo-multiplier or photodiode. An example of a \nhigh resolution spectrum obtained by scanning a narrow-linewidth laser is shown in figure 3.4. \nThis spectrum of OH was recorded in a methane air flame using the BPG to reduce the \nDoppler width of the lines. Since most pulsed lasers have a repetition rate of the order of \n 32\n10Hz the signals may be detected and stored digitally or using a Boxcar averager to improve \nthe signal-to-noise ratio. Alternatively signals may be detected simultaneously on multiple \ntransitions if a broad bandwidth laser is used. All of the signals emitted co-propagate as a \nsingle beam i.e they are multiplexed, and so spectral dispersion is required in this case to \nderive relative intensities of the individual resonantly enhanced signals. Multiplex spectra are \nrecorded on a one- or two-dimensional array detector such as a diode array or CCD. \n \n \nFigure 3.4: A DFWM spectrum of OH in a methane\/air flame at atmospheric pressure. The solid line is the \ntheoretical fit to the data calculated using the analytical result of reference [46]. (Figure reproduced with \npermission from reference [47]). \n \nApart from ensuring that the laser intensity and linewidth are suitable for generating FWM \nsignals the spatial profile of the beams is also found to be important. In practice it is often \nfound that having a Gaussian profile or TEM00 spatial mode will allow good signal-to-noise \ndata to be obtained even when the intensity is several orders of magnitude less than the \nsaturation level. Typically, good signals can be obtained with a smooth beam profile on strong \nmolecular transitions such as the A-X (0,0) band of OH in atmospheric pressure methane\/air \nflames with ~10\u00b5J in a linewidth of ~0.1 cm-1. Alignment of the three incident beams is also \nclearly important. Retro-reflection of one pump beam to provide spatially overlapping beams \nis easily achieved using a simple aperture system. A further aperture at the interaction volume \nis also useful to ensure that the probe beam overlaps the two pumps. Alignment of the signal \n 33\nbeam is made easy by retro-reflecting the probe beam in the BPG to provide a guide beam to \nalign the signal onto the detector. The retro-reflecting mirror is then blocked or removed when \nrecording the DFWM signal. In the case of FPG a system of masks containing apertures to \nguide the beams to cross at a given angle can be made. The direction of the signal beam is \nthen determined by the path through a suitably arranged set of two apertures at the appropriate \nphase-matching angle. In the case of DFWM a symmetric set of four apertures in two masks \nis sufficient to define the directions of the three input beams and the signal beam. Typically a \ncrossing angle of between 2\u00b0-10\u00b0 provides strong signals but these will decrease rapidly as the \ncrossing angle is increased. Finally it is important to ensure temporal overlap of all pulses, at \nleast to within the coherence time of the lasers determined by the inverse of the frequency \nbandwith. \nSpecies concentrations and temperature are the two most important combustion parameters \nthat are routinely measured using optical diagnostics. Other parameters such as bulk gas \nvelocity, flame speed, pressure and mass flow may also be derived from optical measurements. \nAs noted above the signal intensity in coherent scattering processes is usually proportional to \nthe square of the species concentration or number density, N. (In some cases there may be \ndeviations from this behaviour and these will be noted where relevant.) Thus relative or \nabsolute concentrations can be derived in principle from the measured intensities. In order to \nderive absolute concentrations it is usually necessary to perform a calibration measurement \nsince some important experimental parameters may be difficult or impossible to measure \naccurately. \nThe properties of the spectrum such as the relative intensities of different transitions may be \nused to derive temperatures by use of a Boltzmann plot which relates the relative population \nof energy levels NJ e.g. rotational energy levels of quantum number J, to the excitation energy \n\u0394EJ of the levels which depends on the equilibrium temperature, T.

A plot of ln{population} vs. energy should yield \na straight line with slope proportional to 1\/T from which the temperature can be derived. \nSince the signal intensity is proportional to 2JN  and the line strength Bij the quantity: \n[ ] \u23aa\u23ad\n\u23aa\u23ac\n\u23ab\n\u23aa\u23a9\n\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23a7\n+ ij\nsignal\nBJ\nI\nn\n)12(\nl  (3.11)\nrepresents nl {population} and is plotted against the energy term \u0394EJ.

Temperatures are then usually derived from the multiplex spectra by \nfitting a temperature-dependent modelled spectrum to the experimental data. In this case it is \n 35\noften necessary to have an accurate theoretical model not only of the relative intensities but \nalso of the resonant lineshapes and their dependence on temperature and pressure. \nMultiplexed spectral methods provide single-shot data and so are useful in transient \ncombustion situations such as engines, shock tubes or explosions. Scanning methods however \ncan be used advantageously in stable flames. \n 36\n4 Degenerate and non-degenerate four-wave mixing \nThe basic optical layout for generating DFWM signals is shown in figure 4.1 for the BPG \nphase matching arrangement. The essential items are a high power (usually pulsed) laser that \nis frequency tuneable in the region of the resonant transitions of the species being used. An \narrangement of beam splitters is used to generate two pump beams and a single probe beam. \nA second beam splitter is often used to pick off the reflected signal beam in BPG. An \nalternative geometry where the forward and backward pumps are at a small angle can be used \nwhich leads, by phase matching considerations, to the signal beam being generated at the \nsame small angle to the probe. Pump and probe beams can be made orthogonally polarized so \nthat the signal is also orthogonal to the pumps and hence scattered pump light can be filtered \nout by a crossed polarizer in the signal path to the detector. The signal is typically detected by \na photo-detector placed several metres from the interaction region and spatially filtered by \napertures to reduce background interference. \n \n \nFigure 4.1: Basic optical layout for DFWM using BPG. BS, beam splitter, A, apertures. \n \nDegenerate four-wave mixing was first proposed as a diagnostic method for combustion in \n1982 when it was recognised that the resonance enhancement on transitions between excited \nstates allowed signals to be generated by the small excited state populations comparable to \n 37\nradical species densities in flames [48]. DFWM in a flame was observed in experiments \nwhere atomic sodium vapour in a flame was used as a medium for phase conjugate reflection \n[49]. The first detection of a combustion species using DFWM was that of OH in a flame [50]. \nIn this section we present the fundamental theory of DFWM and how it may be extended and \napplied to quantitative measurements of combustion parameters. \n4.1 Fundamentals \nThe basic physics of four-wave mixing outlined in the previous section highlights the crucial \nrole of the third order susceptibility \u03c7(3)(\u03c9) in determining the strength and spectral properties \nof the signal. The form of \u03c7(3)(\u03c9) itself is determined by the details of the interaction between \nthe input fields and the molecular response. A wide range of physical interactions can \ncontribute to \u03c7(3)(\u03c9) such as saturated absorption, two-photon absorption, Raman pumping \netc ... depending on the nature of the input fields and their geometrical arrangement. The \nphysics common to all the third order interactions will be illustrated here by deriving \n\u03c7(3)(\u03c9) in the straightforward case of degenerate fields interacting with a two-level atom. The \nHamiltonian for the system is: \n)(\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6 tVHH o +=  (4.1)\nwhere oH\u02c6 is the unperturbed atomic Hamiltonian i.e. the operator associated with the ground \nstate energy of the atom. )(\u02c6 tV is the perturbation energy arising from the atomic dipole \ninteraction with an oscillating electromagnetic field E(t). \n)()()( 12\n*\n1221 tEtVtV \u03bc\u2212==  (4.2)\nwhere 12\u03bc  is the atomic dipole moment involved in the transition from the ground state 1 to \nthe excited state 2. The statistically averaged response of the medium is described by the \n 38\ndensity matrix composed of the population terms of these two states, \u03c111 and \u03c122, respectively \nand the associated coherence terms representing the dipole, \u03c112 and \u03c121. The time evolution of \nthe atomic ensemble is described by the master equations: \n[ ]\n1\n22\n2112122111 T\nVVi \u03c1\u03c1\u03c1\u03c1 +\u2212=\nh\n&  (4.3)\n[ ]\n1\n22\n1221211222 T\nVVi \u03c1\u03c1\u03c1\u03c1 \u2212\u2212=\nh\n&  (4.4)\n)(1 112221\n2\n2121 \u03c1\u03c1\u03c9\u03c1\u03c1 \u2212+\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +\u2212= Vi\nT\ni o h\n&  (4.5)\nHere o\u03c9h is the energy of the transition between states 1 and 2 and the off-diagonal matrix \nelements representing the coherences satisfy *1221 \u03c1\u03c1 \u2212= . In these equations T1 is the decay \ntime of the population excitation i.e. the longitudinal relaxation time and is usually \ndetermined by the spontaneous or radiative lifetime of the excited state. T2 is the decay time \nof the coherence, the transverse relaxation time, determined by the rate of dephasing of the \ndipole oscillations and usually determined by the atomic collision rate. The equations 4.3, 4.4 \nand 4.5 are solved in the steady state using the rotating wave approximation RWA [51, 52]. \nSince we are principally concerned with how the atomic or molecular populations evolve in \ntime as they interact with the radiation we may neglect terms that oscillate at optical \nfrequencies and concentrate only on slowly varying terms. This may be done mathematically \nby treating the interaction in the frame of reference that rotates with the electric field of the \nincoming photon \u2013 which is fundamentally circularly polarized. In this rotating frame the \ninteraction has a very slow term describing the evolution of the populations and a term at \nessentially twice the optical frequency which is neglected on the timescales of interest. In this \n 39\nrotating wave approximation the population difference between excited and ground states are \ngiven by: \n( )( ) 2221212222\n22\n2\n2\n1122\n)(1\n)(1\nETTT\nT\no\no\n\u03bc\u03c9\u03c9\n\u03c9\u03c9\u03c1\u03c1 +\u2212+\n\u2212+\u2212=\u2212\nh\nh  (4.6)\n( )2\n1122\n*\n21\n2121 2\n)(~\nTi\neEe\no\nti\nti\n+\u2212\n\u2212\u2212==\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u03c9\u03c9\n\u03c1\u03c1\u03bc\u03c1\u03c1\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\nh  (4.7)\nwhere tie \u03c9\u03c1 \u221221~ represents the slowly varying part of the dipole in the RWA. \nWe have now found the elements of the density matrix we need and so we use them to find \nthe Trace of the matrix which gives us the time-dependent polarization P(t) of the medium \nfrom: \n( ) ( )12212112Tr)( \u03c1\u03bc\u03c1\u03bc\u03c1\u03bc +== NNtP  (4.8)\nWriting the polarization as \n22\n)(\n* titi ePPetP\n\u03c9\u03c9 \u2212\n+=  (4.9)\nand recalling EtP o \u03c7\u03b5=)( , we write, \n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +=\n\u2212\n22\n)(\n**\n0\ntiti eEEetP\n\u03c9\u03c9 \u03c7\u03c7\u03b5  (4.10)\nFrom these relations we derive: \n 40\n( )\n222\n2121\n22\n2\n22\n2\n21\n\/)(1\n\/)(\nh\nh\nETTT\nTiTN\no\no\n\u03bc\u03c9\u03c9\n\u03c9\u03c9\u03bc\u03c7 +\u2212+\n+\u2212\u2212=  (4.11)\nThis expression can be simplified by defining a normalized detuning, 2)( To\u03c9\u03c9\u03b4 \u2212= , and the \nline centre saturation intensity: \n2\n2121\n2\n2\n\u03bcTTEI satsat\nh==  (4.12)\nand the line centre absorption coefficient: h2\/2\n2\n21 kTNo \u03bc\u03b1 = , where k is the wavevector at \nfrequency \u03c9, so that: \n( )\n)1(\n2)( 22\nsat\no\nEEk\niE ++\n+\u2212= \u03b4\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03c7  (4.13)\nThe form of this expression shows that it represents the susceptibility arising from saturated \nabsorption. We can use it then to describe a four-wave mixing interaction in which the input \nwaves are coupled via the nonlinearity associated with the saturated absorption and dispersion \nof the medium. \n4.1.1 Theory of DFWM \nThe standard and basic theory of DFWM in absorbing media was presented by Abrams and \nLind [53, 54]. We outline briefly here only the salient features of their approach in order to \nexplain the physics. (As with the more complex situations, treated in further theoretical \ntreatments cited below, mathematical details can be found in the original references.) They \nconsidered a relatively simple situation in which a monochromatic laser field interacted with a \nweakly absorbing (i.e. optically thin) medium composed of stationary two-level atoms. The \n 41\npump fields in the BPG were assumed to have arbitrary intensity but the probe field was weak \n\u2013 allowing a perturbation theory approach.

This is a consequence of the nonlinear coupling in the \nBPG which determines that the signal will be a reflection of the probe. \n \nA more general solution for the signal intensity can be found in terms of the atomic or \nmolecular parameters of interest for diagnostic purposes. Two limiting cases are of interest \ncorresponding to weak and strong pump fields i.e. unsaturating and saturating intensities, \nrespectively [16]: \nprobepumpsig II\nTTkN\nI 232\n4\n2\n2\n1\n228\n21\n)1( \u03b4\n\u03bc\n+\u221d   )0(satpump II <<  (4.23)\npump\nprobe\nsig I\nI\nT\nTkN\nI\n1\n2\n222\n21\u03bc\u221d   )0(satpump II >>  (4.24)\nIn practice the degree of saturation by the pump varies with detuning across the line so the \nexperiments usually record a signal integrated across the whole resonance line.

Firstly we note the signal scales with N2 and so the intensity can be interpreted in \nterms of the species concentration. Secondly, for weak pump beams )1\/( \u2264satII  the signal is \nstrongly affected by pressure or collisional broadening through the dependence on 3\n2\nT . \nThirdly, in the case of strong, or saturating, pump beams ( 1\u2265satII ) the collisional \ndependence is considerably weaker. More sophisticated theoretical models have shown \nspecifically that, in the saturated regime, the dependence of the DFWM signal intensity on the \nrelative rate of dephasing collisions and quenching (population transfer) collisions is \nminimized [55]. Owing to the form of the dependence on T2 the DFWM signal is sensitive \nonly to the total collision rate rather than separately to quenching and dephasing or other \ncollision effects. This feature gives DFWM an advantage over LIF in situations where the \ndifferent collision rates are unknown. Fourthly, for pump intensities less than Isat the signal \nincreases quadratically with pump power whereas for intensities exceeding Isat the signal \ndecreases with increasing pump intensity. This means that the signal will reach a maximum \nfor pump intensities in the region of Isat and will also be least sensitive to fluctuations in the \npump intensity. It is therefore expedient to operate with pump intensities around Isat both to \nminimise the sensitivity to collisional and laser fluctuations and to maximise the signal-to-\nnoise ratio. In practice is it usual to plot the signal strength as a function of pump intensity to \ndetermine the saturation intensity for a given situation since it depends on factors such as \nspatial beam profile and lineshape that may not be accurately known. Provided sufficient \npower is available, a plot will show a deviation from the linear dependence on the square of \npump intensity once the saturation level is approached. \n 45\n4.1.2 Analysis of DFWM signals: Practical considerations \nIn spite of the considerable simplifications involved in the Abrams and Lind model it has \nproved to be remarkably successful in predicting the behaviour of DFWM signals in a wide \nrange of applications. For quantitative diagnostics however it becomes necessary to address \nsome of the major approximations made and to develop theoretical approaches that account \nmore accurately for deviations from the simple model encountered in practical applications. In \norder to improve the Abrams and Lind model the main issues that need to be addressed are: \na) Atomic motion \u2013 in media encountered in combustion the thermal motion of high \ntemperature gases leads to considerable Doppler broadening. A further complication is \nthat in the BPG the motion can lead to cross-over resonances since the moving \nmolecules see the pump beam frequency Doppler shifted in opposite senses leading to \na non-degenerate interaction. In the FPG the atomic motion has different effects on the \nresonance and saturation behaviour. \nb) Effects of a strong probe field \u2013 the grating induced by interference of pump and probe \nwill have highest contrast and greatest scattering efficiency if the pump and probe \nbeams have equal intensity. \nc) Non-monochromatic fields \u2013 most pulsed laboratory lasers have a finite linewidth that \nusually exceeds the linewidth of the resonance transitions. \nd) Level degeneracy and polarization effects \u2013 collisions and orientation of the incident \nfield polarizations will affect the signal behaviour differently from that of a two-level \natom when multiple states are degenerate in the energy levels involved. \ne) Multiple energy levels \u2013 molecular spectra often have closely spaced resonances that \nwill contribute to the signal and so the response will deviate from that of a simple two-\nlevel, single resonance interaction. \n 46\nf) Collisions \u2013 with more complex molecular species collision effects modify the \nlineshape of the response owing to varieties of collisional relaxation effects such as \ndepolarizing collisions and velocity changing collisions. \ng) Optical thickness \u2013 with high densities of certain species or on strongly allowed \ntransitions the medium may be no longer optically thin leading to spatially varying \nchanges in the field intensities through the interaction region. \n \nWe consider first the effects of atomic motion. The most obvious will be to \u201cwash out\u201d the \ninduced grating leading to a reduction in scattering efficiency and lower signals. In the BPG \nthis effect is most serious for the grating formed by the backward pump and the probe since it \nhas a grating spacing \u039b of the order of \u03bb\/2. (See equation 3.8 for \u03b8 \u223c \u03c0) The grating induced \nby the forward pump and probe will have a much wider spacing (\u03b8 \u223c 0, \u039b >> \u03bb) and so suffers \nless from the wash-out effect. The motion also leads to a Doppler shift for the incident laser \nfrequencies and so there will be an effect on the lineshape of the DFWM signal. Atomic \nmotion effects have been treated for the unsaturated regime using perturbation theory [56-59]. \nThese studies show that in the BPG when the Doppler width D\u03c9\u0394  is smaller than the \nhomogeneous width the result is essentially the same as that of Abrams and Lind. The \nlineshape will be a Lorentzian cubed. When however the Doppler width exceeds the \nhomogeneous width then the lineshape becomes a simple Lorentzian with a width equal to the \nhomogeneous width. In the FPG all velocity classes contribute to the signal and the lineshape \nbecomes a convolution of the homogeneous line with a Doppler broadened Gaussian. In the \nlimit where the Doppler linewidth is much larger than the homogeneous width the lineshape is \na Gaussian squared of width 2D\u03c9\u0394 . \nFor the saturated regime the situation is more complicated. The problem was addressed by \nAttal-Tretout and co-workers who used a non-perturbative approach to treat pump saturation \n 47\nand atomic motion effects in the FPG which led to modification of the signal lineshapes [60, \n61]. Their analytical result however was found to work only for unsaturating probes and \nprovided the pumps were not strongly saturating. A rather complete way of treating the \nproblem was introduced by Lucht and co-workers which proceeds by a direct numerical \nintegration, DNI, of the density matrix equations [55]. They have applied their DNI method to \nlift almost all of the major restrictions of the Abrams and Lind model and specifically to \nquantify the effects of atomic motion [62], collisions [63], closely spaced resonances [64], \nlevel degeneracy [65], crossed polarization of laser fields [65], as well as the forward phase-\nmatching geometry [66]. \nThe DNI methods have been validated experimentally but are computationally expensive for \nroutine analysis of data. Often the experimental parameter of most interest is the intensity of \nthe signal given by the reflectivity R, \u2013 the ratio of signal to probe intensity. Reichardt and \nLucht have provided a semi-empirical relationship for R in terms of the relative effects of \nDoppler and collisional broadening given by [62] \n2\nC\nhom\n (  1 )\u0394\/\u0394+= \u03c9\u03c9Db\nRR  (4.27)\nwhere Rhom is the reflectivity calculated from the A&L model, D\u03c9\u0394  and C \u03c9\u0394  are the \nDoppler and collisional widths respectively. The empirical parameter b is a function of the \npump and probe intensity and characterises the saturation level. This result was validated by \ncomparison with the full DNI calculation and experimental data but is qualified by the \nlimitations of the A&L model used to determine Rhom, i.e. restriction to a non-degenerate, \ntwo-level atom and a non-saturating probe. \n \nThe problem of saturation by the probe beam is one of the most important issues from a \npractical point of view since as noted above the signal will be optimised if the pump and \n 48\nprobe have equal intensities. Therefore if the pump is saturating then so will the probe and so \nthe usual perturbative expansion of the field is no longer valid. The DNI method of Lucht et al. \ncan be adapted to treat this problem also but the computational expense remains an issue. \nAlternative numerical approaches have also been developed to calculate the DFWM signals \nbut have not found wide application for routine analysis of experimental data [67, 68]. A non-\nperturbative analytical solution for the DFWM signal intensity and lineshape has been derived \nby Bratfalean et al. that is valid for monochromatic fields of arbitrary intensity of both pump \nand probe [46]. The result has been validated against a full numerical solution and also used \nfor rapid simulation of experimental DFWM spectra of molecules such as C2 and OH [69, 70]. \nThe analytical expression, although complicated, can be calculated on a personal computer in \na matter of seconds allowing spectral fitting routines to be applied to experimental data. OH is \nthe most widely used species for flame diagnostics and an example of a DFWM spectrum of \nthis radical in a methane\/air flame is shown in figure 3.4. The experimental data show part of \nthe A2\u03a3-X2\u03a0(0,0) band of OH with a fitted theoretical spectrum calculated using the model of \n[46]. \n \nThe requirement for high peak power mandates the use of pulsed lasers which, in practice, \nusually have a finite bandwidth. This invalidates the assumption of monochromatic fields and \nleads to significant changes to the lineshape and saturation behaviour of the signals. The finite \nbandwidth is associated with random fluctuations of the field and so the interaction with \natoms or molecules will be affected by the precise form of the field statistics. The general \nproblem of finite bandwidth fields of arbitrary intensity may well be intractable but \napproximate solutions have been derived in some limiting cases. Cooper et al. conducted a \ntheoretical study of the case where the laser bandwidth exceeded all other relaxation rates in \nthe interaction and the results, which involved numerical solutions, were tested \nexperimentally to verify that the predicted saturation behaviour was observed [71, 72]. The \n 49\neffect of pressure on the integrated signal intensity has also been tested using this theoretical \nmodel albeit in an intermediate regime. Nonetheless the decay of the signal induced by \nbroadband lasers with pressure was found to agree with theoretical predictions [73]. \nA theoretical model for the lineshape of DFWM signals induced by broadband fields was \nderived by Smith and Ewart and the results verified by measurements on signals generated in \nflame OH [74]. Their model predicts a Voigt-type profile, dependent on the collision rate \u0393, \nin which the collisional width is 2\u0393 in the collisionally dominated regime and 4\u0393 in the limit \nof dominant Doppler broadening. \nA perturbative (weak field limit) method was developed by Vaccaro and co-workers which \ninvolved time domain solutions that could be evaluated analytically and therefore efficiently \n[75]. The non-perturbative analytical method of Bratfalean et al. [46] can be extended to treat \nfinite bandwidth laser interactions by modelling the interaction as an independent spectral \nresponse ISR to a set of uncorrelated monochromatic components spanning the laser \nbandwidth. This method has been used to analyze multiplex FWM spectra induced by very \nbroadband fields [76]. The ISR approach incorporates the contribution of non-degenerate \nFWM interactions but only in the limit of unsaturating intensities. Such non-degenerate \nsignals are, in principle, inevitable with the use of broad bandwidth fields. Owing to the \ndifficulty in treating such effects under saturation conditions they may be ignored in order to \ntreat the more important effect of saturation which is effectively dominated by degenerate \nspectral components close to resonance. \nLevel degeneracies and polarization effects modify the standard Abrams and Lind result and \nneed to be considered when probing molecular species by DFWM. The signal-to-noise ratio is \noften improved by using crossed laser polarizations in pump and probe beams. The generated \nsignal is then orthogonally polarized to the strong pumps and so use of a crossed polarizer in \nthe detection path leads to improved rejection of noise from scattered pump radiation. The \neffect on the signal is described by a J-dependent geometrical factor G(J); a function of the \n 50\nrelative polarization and the \u0394J of the transition, which modifies the basic A&L result for \nboth weak and strong pump fields [77, 78]. \nAbsorption by the medium may be a problem when using strong resonance lines to enhance \nthe DFWM signal. In particular the distortion of relative intensities of different molecular \nlines caused by line-centre absorption will affect values of temperature or concentration \nderived from the signals [79, 80]. In this case the signal no longer follows the expected \nquadratic dependence on number density, N. In general the treatment requires numerical \ncalculation appropriate to the particular situation. Absorption will reduce the intensity of the \nincoming pump and probe leading to reduced signal generation. The effects may be \ncompensated partially by use of saturating laser power [48, 81]. As a general rule it is \nadvisable to use only optically thin media for quantitative measurements using DFWM. In \nmany cases this can be achieved by simply using a transition in the molecule of interest that \nhas a suitably low line strength yet sufficient to provide measurable signals. \nResonant four-wave mixing has found widespread application in a range of molecular physics \nstudies including collision dynamics, kinetics and spectroscopy of jet cooled species. In the \npresent review however we focus on the applications of relevance to combustion. We first \nnote the range of species detected using one- and two-photon resonant processes using laser \nexcitation in spectral ranges from the UV to the mid-IR. Secondly we review the application \nto measurement of combustion parameters concentration and temperature where \nmeasurements have been made in point, line and 2-D configurations. We note the two main \napproaches that use either narrow linewidth lasers for scanned spectroscopy or broad \nbandwidth sources for multiplex spectroscopy. Additionally we consider the Two-Colour \nFWM variant and its particular merits. A review of applications in practical combustion \ndevices will be presented in section 9. \n 51\n4.2 Molecular physics applications \nThe first application of resonant FWM to species of combustion interest was the detection of \nthe OH radical in a methane air flame by Ewart and O\u2019Leary using transitions in the A-X \n(0,0) band around 308 nm [50]. Since then many molecular and radical species have been \ndetected in flames, cells or high temperature arc sources making use of the discrimination \nafforded by the coherent signal against flame luminescence or scattering. Important diatomic \nradical species OH, NH [82, 83], CH [84], CN [85] and C2 [86, 87] were detected and used to \nevaluate the utility of DFWM as a diagnostic technique in flames. Stable combustion product \nspecies such as NO [88] and NO2 [89] which are major atmospheric pollutants were also \ndetected. Polyatomic species important in combustion such as CH3 have been detected using \nDFWM on the UV absorption bands [90, 91] and CH4, C2H2 and C2H4 have been detected on \nthe C-H stretching modes in the mid-IR [92-95]. \nQuantitative analysis of the DFWM spectra required detailed understanding of the various \neffects outlined in the previous section which modify the behaviour from that predicted by the \nsimple Abrams and Lind model. Such quantitative analysis in turn stimulated the drive \ntowards higher resolution spectra and the use of narrow linewidth lasers to eliminate the \neffects of laser bandwidth. \nImportant deviations from the simple theoretical predictions include cross-over resonances \nthat arise in the BPG and the effects of atomic motion. Moving atoms in the BPG see each \npump frequency Doppler shifted in opposite directions and so a resonance occurs when the \nlaser frequency is tuned to the mid-point between two transitions that share a common level. \nThe moving absorber is tuned into resonance with one pump going one way and the other \npump going in the opposite direction leading to an extra resonance feature in the spectra of \nNO [96]. \nCoherent interference effects also arise when two or more closely adjacent transitions \ncontribute to the DFWM signal at a given frequency. Constructive interference leads to \n 52\nenhanced signal strength above that expected on the basis of the thermal population of the \ninitial rotational state. On the other hand destructive interference leads to dips in the intensity \nthat appear to sharpen the resonances on some spectral features. Such features were observed \nin DFWM spectra of C2 in an oxy-acetylene flame [87]. Incorporating such effects leads to \nbetter fits of theoretically modelled spectra with experimental data. Using the analytical \nmodel of Bratfalean et al. (see figure 4.2) [46] high-resolution DFWM spectra of C2 in an oxy-\nacetylene flame were analysed including such coherent interference effects and probe \nsaturation. The data provided improved accuracy in the line positions and also improved \nvalues of the molecular parameters of C2 since high J-value states were detected which probe \nwider ranges of the inter-atomic potential [69]. Such spectroscopic data is important for the \nanalysis of experimental DFWM spectra and for the accurate derivation from the spectra of \ncombustion parameters such as temperature. \n \n \nFigure 4.2: High resolution DFWM spectrum of the d3\u03a0g \u2013a3\u03a0u (0,0) band of C2 in an atmospheric pressure \noxy-acetylene flame recorded using a scanning narrow-bandwidth pulsed dye laser and the BPG to reduce the \nDoppler width of the lines. The temperature derived from this spectrum is 3009 K. (Figure reproduced with \npermission from reference [47].) \n \nSingle-photon resonant FWM allows access to electronic transitions in the near UV, visible \nand IR spectral regions. Two-photon resonant FWM however can provide access to molecular \n 53\nor atomic transitions of higher energy and has been applied to detection of NH3 [97] and \natomic hydrogen [98] which play important roles in air-fed combustion chemistry. Atomic \noxygen has also been detected in flames using two-photon resonant DFWM [99]. \n4.3 Concentration measurements and thermometry applications \nIn principle the absolute concentration of the resonantly interacting species in DFWM could \nbe deduced from the measurement of the signal intensity and comparison with the \ntheoretically predicted intensity. Due attention however must be paid to all the effects \ndiscussed previously that modify the predictions of the DFWM intensity based on the Abrams \nand Lind model. In many situations, notably in optically thin media with unsaturating, \nmonochromatic probe beams signal estimates based on the Abrams and Lind model work \nsurprisingly well. The complications encountered in practice and listed in section 4.1.2 can be \naccounted for in various ways. Effects of atomic motion, saturating probe beams and non-\nmonochromatic fields are accounted for by using the appropriate theoretical model. \nRelaxation effects arising from de-polarizing collisions on degenerate states may also be \naccounted for using appropriate theoretical models and simplified by use of parallel \npolarization of all incident beams. Collisional effects are mitigated by operation with \nsaturating fields and absorption effects may be avoided by using optically thin media or \noperating with transitions having lower line strengths.  \nIn practice however derivation of the absolute concentration from measured signal intensities \nis difficult since many of the parameters required for such a direct measurement are not \nsufficiently well known. Relative concentrations, on the other hand, are much easier to derive \nfrom relative intensity measurements. Such relative measurements are often useful since the \nvariation of concentration with some other parameter may provide useful information e.g. \nspatial distributions of radical species within a flame. Care however needs to be exercised if \nconditions in the flame or gas being investigated vary spatially or temporally. Variations in \n 54\ntemperature, Doppler and collisional widths for example may lead to differences in relative \nintensities that do not map the relative state populations. Attal-Tretout and co-workers \nmeasured OH concentration profiles in an oxy-acetylene flame and found good agreement \nbetween experiment and theory for laser intensities I ~ Isat [61]. Reichardt and Lucht have \nshown also that measurements in the saturated regime reduce the sensitivity of concentration \nmeasurements to the variations in Doppler and collisional width as well as laser intensity \nfluctuations. By careful choice of an appropriate rotational transition the DFWM reflectivity, \ngiven by the relationship in equation 4.27, can be shown to be directly proportional to the \nsquare of the concentration over a wide range of temperature [62]. Using saturated DFWM \nOH concentrations were measured in a well-characterised H2-air flame for a range of fuel \nequivalence ratios from 0.5 to 1.5. The flame was stabilized on a Hencken burner that had \nbeen shown to produce near-adiabatic temperatures and near-equilibrium H-atom \nconcentrations at the measurement point over a wide range of equivalence ratios. By \nnormalizing the experimental data to calculated values at one equivalence ratio the \nconcentrations were put on an absolute scale [81]. (see figure 4.3) \n \n \nFigure 4.3: Quantitative measurement of OH number density in a H2-air flame measured by saturated DFWM. \nThe data points represent measurements based on peak signal intensity (solid circles) and line-integrated signals \n(open circles) i.e. intensity values integrated over the spectral line providing the resonance enhancement. \n(Figure reproduced with permission from reference [81].) \n \n 55\nSimultaneous measurement of the DFWM signal and some other optical signal that has a \ndifferent dependence on transition moments (or Einstein B-coefficient, B) and concentration, \nN, has been proposed as a way of eliminating unknown factors for absolute concentration \nmeasurements. The combination of DFWM which depends on 4B  and 2N and linear \nabsorption which depends on B  and N allows the unknown parameters to be derived from \nmultiplexed measurements [100]. Radi and co-workers have applied this method and a \ncalibration against a signal from a known concentration to derive absolute concentrations of \nOH and S2 in a flame [101, 102]. \nCombustion diagnostics often demands measurements of relevant parameters such as \nconcentration and temperature over extended regions of space. The challenge is then to extend \nmeasurements at a point defined by crossed beams to 1-D (line) and 2-D (surface) \nmeasurements. Point-wise measurements were used to map the variation in atomic sodium \ndensity over a plane in a flame by moving the flame relative to the crossing point of the pump \nand probe beams [50]. Two-dimensional maps of relative concentration were then obtained by \nintersecting a circular profile probe beam with planar sheet pump beams [103]. (Details about \nmultidimensional applications will be discussed in section 9). Concentration imaging was \nthen extended to OH in a flame [104]. Owing to the need to use small crossing angles the \nimages formed by DFWM are severely foreshortened. The dependence on the cube of the \nintensity also leads to severe variations in image brightness arising from non-uniform laser \nbeams. Some attempt to normalize for inhomogeneous beams was made by recording \nsimultaneously an image generated in a uniform sample in a cell [105]. The practical \ndifficulties in obtaining and analyzing images generated by DFWM have so far limited its \napplication for 2-D imaging of concentrations. \nThe potential of resonant DFWM for thermometry was demonstrated by Dreier and \nRakestraw who recorded DFWM spectra of OH in a flame [106]. The temperature was \nderived from the relative intensities of rotational lines assumed to be in thermodynamic \n 56\nequilibrium \u2013 a condition that is usually well fulfilled in atmospheric pressure flames. The \nmethod relies on the use of a Boltzmann plot as outlined above with equation 3.10 and can be \nused only for stable flames in which conditions do not change in the time taken to record the \nspectrum \u2013 typically 10 to 30 minutes using pulsed lasers at 10 Hz repetition rate. A common \nproblem that needs to be avoided in using DFWM for thermometry is absorption which will \naffect stronger lines more than weak ones leading to distortion of the spectral intensity and \nhence error in the derived temperature. A recursion relation has been introduced to overcome \nthis problem [80]. In practice it is best to avoid this problem by working with optically thin \nmedia or using spectral transitions that do not suffer absorption of more than a few percent. \nSince temperature is an intensive, rather than an extensive variable it is important to limit the \nmeasurement volume so that it does not include regions of different temperature. This \nproblem has been addressed in the context of CARS thermometry where measurements are \nsometimes biased towards lower values owing to the higher density in colder regions and the \nquadratic dependence on number density. It is therefore important to limit the size of the \nmeasurement volume to dimensions smaller than length scales over which the temperature \nmay be varying. Further discussion on this issue is found in section 5. Problems arise also if \ntemperature gradients and hence refractive index gradients occur that deviate the pump beams \nand so affect the size and location of the measurement volume. An early attempt to avoid such \nbeam steering problems was made by using a phase conjugate mirror to reflect the forward \npump beam in order to generate a distortion-free backward pump to maintain exact overlap of \nthe two pumps [107, 108]. Using this arrangement temperatures were derived from DFWM \nspectra of OH in a flame [109]. An alternative and more easily implemented strategy that \nminimizes beam steering effects is to use the FPG since all beams propagate through \napproximately similar optical paths. Using this method temperatures were measured using \nDFWM of C2 by Nyholm et al. [86]. \n \n 57\n \nFigure 4.4: Single shot multiplex DFWM spectrum of OH in a methane\/oxygen flame at 1 bar pressure. The line \nassignments are given to the transitions in the R-branch of the A\u2013X (0,0) band of OH. The spectrum was \nrecorded using a broadband modeless laser frequency-doubled by two consecutive doubling crystals. The lower \ngraph shows the simultaneously recorded spectrum of the frequency-doubled modeless laser. (Figure \nreproduced with permission from reference [47].) \n \nTemporally resolved thermometry requires that the spectral information is obtained within a \nsingle laser pulse \u2013 a result that is achieved using multiplex or broadband DFWM first \ndemonstrated by Ewart and Snowdon [110]. The first application of broadband DFWM to \nthermometry used a broadband laser whose spectral width was sufficient to span several lines \nin OH [79]. A two-line version of the technique used a conventional laser source with a \nbandwidth sufficient to span two neighbouring but temperature sensitive lines of OH [111]. \nThe accuracy of these initial measurements was limited by the difficulty of producing \nsufficiently wide spectral coverage of the OH spectrum since the lasers employed had to be \nfrequency doubled to produce the necessary UV radiation. OH has a relatively open spectrum \nwith rotational lines being widely spaced compared to many other molecules and the limited \nspectral width of frequency doubled broadband lasers thus presents a difficulty. It is the \nphase-matching requirement that limits the range of wavelengths that can be frequency \ndoubled in a single crystal. One way of overcoming this limitation was to use a broadband \nmodeless laser as the fundamental beam and two crystals oriented separately to double \ndifferent regions of the broadband spectrum. An example of a single shot broadband OH \n 58\nspectrum recorded using DFWM with an extended UV laser-spectrum obtained in this way is \nshown in figure 4.4. \nImproved accuracy and precision was achieved by using the fundamental output of a \nbroadband modeless laser operating in the blue spectral region to access transitions in the C2 \nmolecule by Kaminski et al. [112]. The use of a modeless laser also reduced the spectral noise \nthat is a feature of conventional broadband lasers [113-115]. Accurate and precise temperature \nmeasurements of an oxy-acetylene flame were obtained since a large number of transitions \nwere probed simultaneously. The temperature was derived by fitting a modelled multiplex-\nDFWM spectrum to the experimental data using temperature as the fitting parameter. As part \nof the fitting procedure the relative intensities of the recorded lines were scaled using the \nrelative intensity of the broadband laser at each spectral location by reference to the \nsimultaneously recorded laser spectrum. The intensity scaling was carried out assuming the \nrelative intensity appropriate to unsaturated FWM signals. \nGenerally speaking, the larger the number of transitions that are probed the more precise and \naccurate the derived temperature since averaging reduces the effects of spectral noise on \nindividual spectral components. An example of what is possible is shown in figure 4.5 \nshowing a significant portion of the d3\u03a0g \u2013a3\u03a0u (0,0) band of C2 recorded in a single shot. \nCare must be taken however to avoid strongly pumping transitions having a common upper or \nlower level. This can arise in parts of the molecular band where the Fortrat parabola brings \nsuch transitions into neighbouring spectral regions. This effect was studied experimentally \nand theoretically by Lloyd and Ewart who showed that the dephasing effect on the DFWM \nprocess arising from pumping by a broadband laser on coupled transitions can lead to errors in \nthe derived temperature [116]. \n \n 59\n513.5 514.0 514.5 515.0 515.5 516.0 516.5\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nIn\nte\nns\nity\n (a\nrb\n.u\nni\nts\n)\nWavelength \/ nm  \nFigure 4.5: Single-shot multiplex FWM spectrum of d3\u03a0g \u2013a3\u03a0u (0,0) band of C2 in an oxy-acetylene flame. \nThe upper line shows the intensity spectrum of the broadband modeless laser used to generate the signal. Note \nthe considerably wider spectral coverage compared to the spectrum of OH in figure 4.4 using the second \nharmonic of a modeless laser. (Figure reproduced with permission from reference [47]). \n \nA useful variant of DFWM uses one laser to provide the pump and a second laser at a \ndifferent wavelength to provide the probe beam. This Two-Colour Resonant Four-Wave \nMixing, TC-RFWM gains some advantages over DFWM at the expense of having to use two \nlasers instead of one [117]. The signal is generated when transitions excited by the two \ndifferent wavelengths share a common level, either upper or lower. The signal is generated \nonly in the presence of both beams and can be used to simplify the signal analysis in \nspectrally congested regions. Additionally the signal is more easily discriminated using \nspectral filters from the strong pump beams at a different wavelength. Variations on this \ntheme of two-colour interactions allow different schemes of double-resonance to study \nmolecular excited states and combustion relevant species [118, 119]. Applications of TC-\nFWM included the detection of OH [120, 121], CH [122], NH [120, 121], C2 [123], ammonia \n[124] and atomic hydrogen [98].  \nA major aim of combustion diagnostics is to develop methods by which relevant parameters \ncan be measured in technical combustion systems such as engines or gas turbines. The \n 60\napplication of resonant FWM techniques to such technical combustors is discussed in section \n9. \n 61\n5 Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering \nThe birth of coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, CARS, is usually dated to 1965 and the \nobservation by Maker and Terhune of \u201cthree wave mixing\u201d in benzene induced by a pulsed \nruby laser [125]. The application of this nonlinear effect to combustion diagnostics was \nstimulated by the observation of CARS in gases by Taran and co-workers in the early to mid \n1970s. The essential features of the optical setup for generating CARS signals are illustrated \nin figure 5.1. Unlike the degenerate four-wave mixing schemes discussed in the previous \nsection at least two or even three laser sources of different wavelength are required. \n \n \nFigure 5.1: Basic optical layout for CARS. \n \nFigure 5.2 shows the energy level diagrams of the principle configurations that are typically \nused. The most commonly employed form of CARS involves a two-photon resonance \nmediated by one photon from the pump beam and one from the Stokes beam. Owing to the \nlow probability of such transitions signals are usually observed only from majority species. A \ngreater range of sensitivity however can be achieved using resonant enhancement allowing \nthe detection of minor species. The most common approach is rotational or vibrational CARS \nwhere the difference between the frequency of the pump, \u03c91, and Stokes, \u03c92, lasers matches a \nrotational or rovibrational Raman transition of the species of interest: \u03c91 - \u03c92 = \u03c9R.  \n 62\n \n \nFigure 5.2: Energy level schemes of a) conventional rotational\/vibrational CARS, b) electronically resonantly \nenhanced dual-pump CARS and c) electronically resonantly enhanced CARS. \n \nRotational and vibrational CARS are established tools for temperature measurements using \nmolecular nitrogen, N2, which is present in a high concentration in all air-fed combustion \nenvironments. In addition the detection of other major species e.g., O2 [126], CO [127], CO2 \n[128], H2 [129], H2O [130] and C2H2 [131] has been reported. Since neither the pump nor the \nStokes frequencies correspond to allowed single photon transitions the excitation is achieved \nvia a two-photon process. As mentioned before, the probability of such two-photon excitation \nis much lower than one-photon processes and consequently the sensitivity of the Raman \nprocess allows only major species to be detected with a minimum concentration of typically \n~1%. In order to increase the sensitivity to allow minor species detection (~100 ppm) the \nprobe laser may be tuned to an allowed electronic transition (see figure 5.2b) [132]. By taking \nthis resonance enhancement one step further tuning all laser frequencies to electronic \ntransitions of the molecule of interest, as illustrated in figure 5.2c, detection limits of the order \nof 1 ppm can be achieved [16]. \nSince CARS is a parametric process phase matching of the input and signal waves is \nnecessary for efficient signal generation. Phase matching may be effected by one of several \narrangements. For combustion diagnostics the most commonly employed geometrical \narrangements are the planar and folded crossed beam layouts (often referred to as \nBOXCARS) and the unstable-resonator spatially enhanced detection (USED-CARS) which \n 63\ntakes advantage of the donut shaped beam from an unstable laser cavity, see figure 5.3. Each \nof these approaches has its peculiar advantages and disadvantages. With planar BOXCARS \n(fig. 5.3a) the measurement volume may be considered to be approximately a cylinder with a \nlength typically of a few millimetres and a diameter of order of hundreds of microns. One \nadvantage of this method is the fact that the signal wave is emitted from the intersection \nregion in almost the same direction as one of the pump lasers and so this pump beam can be \nused to track the signal path to the spectrometer \u2013 which, otherwise would be difficult to \ndiscern since the weak signal is usually not visible to the naked eye. This simplifies the \nexperiment significantly. The folded BOXCARS (fig. 5.3b) scheme in contrast provides \nhigher spatial resolution owing to the three-dimensional beam overlapping geometry. The \nexperimental application is, however, somewhat more difficult as the signal direction is not \nindicated by one of the incident laser beams. In practice then a system of apertures in masks is \nusually constructed to map out the positions of the three input beams (pump and Stokes). The \ndirection of the signal beam is then indicated by apertures to guide a pilot beam (e.g. a HeNe \nlaser) to positions calculated using the known phase matching condition for the wavelengths \nconcerned. The USED-CARS (fig. 5.3c) approach is especially attractive for applications in \ntechnical combustion systems. In this case all the laser beams are directed into the \nmeasurement volume by the same optical components and as a consequence the alignment is \ncomparatively easy and the setup is very stable. The spatial resolution however is slightly \nlower than in the BOXCARS arrangements. \nSpatial resolution is an important issue in measurements of temperature using non-linear \nmethods such as CARS where the measurement volume may contain regions of significantly \ndifferent temperature. For example turbulent gases may contain unmixed hot and cold gases \non the length scale of a few millimetres or the interaction region may include a flame front \nwith burned (hot) and unburned (cold) gas. Since the CARS signal is proportional to the \nsquare of the number density the resulting signal may be dominated by contributions from \n 64\ncold regions where the density is higher. This was first highlighted by Taran and co-workers \n[133]. In order to account for this problem Snelling and Parameswaran showed that it is \nimportant to simulate the theoretical spectrum by coherent addition of the signals from \ndifferent temperature regions [134]. The identification and evaluation of such effects in \nexperimentally recorded CARS spectra has been achieved using a weighting procedure by \nSeeger et al. [135]. \n \n \nFigure 5.3: Phase matching schemes for CARS (a) planar BOXCARS, (b) folded BOXCARS. k1 and k3 are the \nwave vectors of two photons at the pump frequency \u03c91 and k2 of a photon at the Stokes frequency \u03c92. The \nfolded BOXCARS arrangement is obtained by folding the plane in figure (a) along the axis shown in (b) by an \nangle of 90\u00b0. The actual geometry or the arrangement is such that the beams indicated by the ki-vectors intersect \nat a point. Folded BOXCARS is symmetric about the folding axis so by rotating diagram (b) through 2\u03c0 the \ngeometry of USED-CARS is obtained as shown in (c). In practice the donut shaped pump beam at \u03c91 is \nproduced by the transverse mode structure of the beam emitted by an unstable resonator. \n \n5.1 Theory of CARS \nAlthough electronic enhancement is necessary for realizing minor species detection using \nCARS the basic theory will be described for laser frequencies far away from any resonances. \nThis simplifies the theoretical treatment significantly and illustrates the essential physics. In \ndue course some aspects involved in resonance enhancement will be discussed. A more \n 65\ndetailed discussion of the CARS fundamentals can be found in Eckbreth [16] and the \nreferences therein. \nThe basic principles of nonlinear light-matter-interactions have been presented in chapter 3. \nThe essential features involve the wave equation 3.2, the general equation for the polarization \ninduced by an incoming field 3.3 and the expression for the nonlinear polarization induced by \nthree incident monochromatic fields 3.5. Taking this as a starting point and assuming three \nincoming fields with frequencies \u03c91 (pump), \u03c92 (Stokes) and \u03c93 (probe) the CARS signal is \ngenerated at \u03c94 = \u03c91 - \u03c92 + \u03c93. The susceptibility tensor of fourth order has, in general, 81 \ncomponents. For symmetry reasons the resulting CARS polarization PCARS(\u03c94) can be \nsimplified to one containing 27 individual terms. In an isotropic medium, such as a gas, there \nare 21 non-zero elements of which only three are independent. The relevant components of \nthe susceptibility tensor then have the form: \nxyyxxyxyxxyyxxxx \u03c7\u03c7\u03c7\u03c7 ++=  (5.1)\nwhere the subscripts \u03c71234 represent the Cartesian axes indicating the direction of the electric \nfield polarization of input (1,2 and 3) and signal (4) waves with \n( )baxxyy ++= 224\n1 \u03c3\u03c7  (5.2a)\n( )baxyxy ++= 224\n1 \u03c3\u03c7  (5.2b)\n( )bxyyx 224\n1 += \u03c3\u03c7  (5.2c)\n 66\nwhere \u03c3 is the susceptibility\u2019s non-resonant electronic component, and a and b are the \nisotropic and anisotropic components of the Raman susceptibility, respectively. A detailed \nderivation has been presented by Owyoung [136]. Considering these equations allows \ncalculation of the polarization state of the CARS wave and its dependence on the incident \nfield polarization states. These relationships have been utilized to find relative orientations of  \nthe input beam polarization states to suppress either the elastically scattered laser light [137] \nor the non-resonant signal contributions which are usually difficult to quantify [138]. In the \nfollowing however we consider the simplest situation, i.e., when the polarizations of all lasers \nand as a consequence the signal polarization are parallel. \nWriting the electric field of a travelling wave as a harmonic oscillation of frequency \u03c9i \n( ) ( ) rikii ieErE rrrr \u22c5\u22c5= \u03c9\u03c9 ,  (5.3)\nwhere ( )iE \u03c9r  is the amplitude and ki is the wave vector and combining this definition with the \nwave equation and the equation for the third order polarization the resulting differential \nequation for the signal wave becomes \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) kziCARS eEEEcz\nzEik\nz\nzE \u0394\u00d7\u2212=\u2202\n\u2202\u22c5+\u2202\n\u2202\n32\n*\n12\n2\n44\n42\n4\n2 ,2, \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c7\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9  (5.4)\nThe * superscript denotes the complex conjugate, the z coordinate takes into account that the \nsignal is generated only in a single direction due to the phase matching (see section 3) and the \nparameter \u0394k is often referred to as phase mismatch defined as (compare eq. 3.7) \n4321 kkkkk \u2212+\u2212=\u0394  (5.5)\nAssuming that the phase mismatch is small allows the second order differential term in eq. 5.4 \nto be neglected and so the relation for the CARS signal intensity is given by \n 67\n( )\n( )\n2\n2\n321\n2\n4321\n2\n4\n2\n2sin\n\u23ad\u23ac\n\u23ab\n\u23a9\u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u0394\n\u0394\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u221d\nkl\nkllIII\nnnnn\nI CARSCARS \u03c7\u03c9  (5.6)\nwhere ni are the refractive indices for the frequencies of the individual fields, Ii are the laser \nintensities and l is the length of the laser beam intersection region.

Further details of the derivation \nof the CARS susceptibility and signal intensity are given by Eckbreth [16]. As mentioned \nabove the equations 5.6 and 5.8 are valid only for the case that none of the laser frequencies is \nin resonance with an electronic transition of a molecule. In the case of electronic resonances \nthe treatment becomes more complicated as additional molecular parameters such as \nintermediate state populations, transitions strengths, linewidths and saturation effects must be \n 68\ntaken into account. These effects are beyond the scope of the present article and the reader is \nreferred to the literature, see e.g. references [132, 139-141]. \n \nFrom equations 5.6 and 5.8 a number of implications for the practical application of CARS \ncan be seen. Equation 5.6 involves parameters that do not depend on molecular factors. \nSpecifically, for this case of non-resonant interaction, the signal depends linearly on each of \nthe incident laser intensities. When, however, one or more of the lasers is tuned towards \nelectronic transitions nonlinear enhancement and\/or saturation effects may occur that alter \nsignificantly the intensity dependence. For quantitative temperature and concentration \nmeasurements these effects must be taken into account. The signal is also seen to depend \nquadratically on the length of the intersection region or measurement volume. This quadratic \ndependence on the length effectively limits the spatial resolution since the signal drops \nsignificantly when the measurement volume is reduced in length. The last factor in equation \n5.6 describes the influence of the phase mismatch which leads to a sensitivity to the precision \nof the experimental alignment. This factor is maximal for (sinx\/x)x\u21920 = 1 i.e. when \u0394k tends to \nzero. This condition of perfect phase matching is achieved by overlapping the laser beams at \nthe exactly correct angles to satisfy the conservation of momentum of the incident photons. \nThe molecular parameters are included in the resonant part of the CARS susceptibility given \nin equation 5.8. The numerator contains the population of the initial energy state as well as the \npopulation difference of the states involved in the two-photon Raman transition and the cross \nsection for spontaneous Raman scattering. Simply speaking the latter is a molecule-specific \nquantity describing the Raman transition probability. The first two factors highlight the strong \ntemperature dependence arising from the Boltzmann distribution of the population over the \nquantum states. The denominator contains the spectral parameters of the Raman transition \ninvolved. When the frequency difference of the pump and Stokes laser (\u03c91-\u03c92) matches the \n 69\nRaman frequency \u03c9ab within the transition linewidth \u0393ab the denominator becomes minimal \nand consequently the CARS signal is maximised. In electronic resonantly enhanced CARS \n(ERE-CARS) the signal experiences an enhancement by several orders of magnitude as the \ntransition probabilities for single-photon resonances are much higher compared to fully non-\nresonant or multiple-photon-resonant processes. \n5.2 Molecular physics applications \nThe resonantly enhanced CARS variant where all lasers are in resonance with electronic \nsingle-photon transitions was mainly used from the late 1970s until the mid 1990s. The first \napplication of ERE-CARS to a gas was the detection of iodine by Attal and co-workers in \n1978 [142]. In the following years the technique was applied to studying combustion relevant \nspecies. \nAs with other optical diagnostics the OH radical was studied frequently owing to its \nimportance in combustion and its advantageous spectroscopic properties. After first \nexperiments by Verdieck et al. [143] pumping the OH A-X(1,0) transition, Attal-Tretout et al., \ncomparing different experimental arrangements, studied OH produced in a discharge and an \natmospheric flat flame by using resonance enhancement via the A-X(0,0) band [141]. In a \nfollow-up work they performed measurements in premixed methane\/air flames in a pressure \nrange from 1 to nearly 10 bar [144]. They overlapped the beams of three frequency-doubled \ntuneable lasers in a folded BOXCARS geometry. The pump and probe lasers were tuned to \nthe A-X(0,0) P1 7.5 and (1,1) R1 5.5 transitions, respectively, while the Stokes laser was \nscanned across the (0,1) O1 7.5 line. It was found that pressure induced line shifts may be \nneglected under certain conditions. Moreover, the effects of systematically detuning the \nindividual lasers from the exact resonant frequencies were investigated. This allowed the \nlinewidths and lineshapes of each transition involved to be studied independently and enabled \nthe contributions from stray light and non-resonant four-wave mixing processes to be \n 70\nmodelled. OH radicals were also involved in several works where resonantly enhanced CARS \nwas compared to DFWM [60, 145] and LIF [146] measurements. \nElectronic enhancement of CARS allows detection of minor species other than OH including \nthe diatomic species C2 [147-149], CH [150], and NO [151, 152]. Furthermore polyatomic \nmolecules such as NO2 [153], NH2 [154], and C2H2 [155] have been investigated using this \ntechnique. Initially, CARS spectroscopy was mainly used for nitrogen thermometry and \nconcentration measurements of major species such as reactants and products of combustion. \nHowever, more recently, the interest in using CARS for intermediate and minor species \ndetection has experienced a kind of renaissance. In particular the dual-pump CARS approach \nillustrated in figure 5.2b where the probe laser wavelength is tuned to an electronic transition \nof the species under investigation was employed to study nitric oxide [132, 156-159] and \nacetylene [160]. This approach has some advantages compared to the one with three lasers in \nresonance. As the only requirement for the pump and Stokes laser is that their difference \nfrequency matches a Raman transition, their wavelengths need not be in the ultraviolet (as is \ntypically the case for exciting single-photon electronic resonances). Using visible radiation \nusually simplifies the experimental arrangement significantly. Moreover, in the visible \nspectral range broadband dye lasers are available for use as the Stokes source thus allowing \nsingle-shot multiple line measurement for time-resolved determination of concentration or \ntemperature [159]. \nAs mentioned above the NO molecule has been extensively studied in recent years. Following \nproof-of-principle experiments [156] concentration measurements were also demonstrated. A \nperturbative theory (i.e. for low input laser powers) and a model for calculating ERE-CARS \nspectra of NO was then developed [132]. In order to validate the model Kuehner et al. \nconducted experiments in binary mixtures of NO with the buffer gas nitrogen. The pump laser \nwas at a fixed wavelength of 532 nm while either the Stokes or the probe laser respectively \nwas scanned over Raman-active electronic transitions. For both approaches good agreement \n 71\nwas found between experimental measurements and model predictions of line positions and \nrelative line intensities. By finding a detection limit of 100 ppm NO the application of the \nmethod to minor species was conclusively demonstrated. Following this work Patnaik et al. \n[161] studied collisional effects on the molecular dynamics and made a comparison with a \nprevious investigation on quenching of NO in the presence of CO2, O2 and N2 [162]. By using \na density-matrix approach to model the evolution of the four-level molecular system it was \nshown that excited-state electronic quenching does not significantly affect the excited-state \npopulation or the ground-state Raman coherence. In addition, Roy et al. [162] showed that \nthis model explained the observations that the ERE-CARS signal is far less sensitive to \nquenching than LIF under similar conditions. \n5.3 Concentration measurements and thermometry applications \nQuantitative information can be extracted from CARS spectra in various ways. The most \ncommon application of CARS is to measure temperature using the nitrogen molecule. The \ntemperature is derived from fitting of experimental to theoretically calculated spectra using \ntemperature as a fitting parameter. The same procedure can be used to determine \nconcentration. Alternatively a calibration measurement may be made with gas samples of \nknown composition. Such calibration methods however are not feasible for combustion \nintermediate radicals since they are reactive species and so it is not possible to provide stable, \nwell-defined samples. \nIn general, the only requirement for performing concentration measurements with CARS is \nthat any characteristic feature of the species of interest can be distinguished in the spectrum. \nThis can in principle be a parameter such as the integrated line intensity, the peak amplitude \nor the spectral shape as long as they change sufficiently with concentration. In the case of \nminor species, however, the low concentration results in a resonant signal that is small \nrelative to the non-resonant background which interferes with the spectral signature. In order \n 72\nto overcome this problem two potential approaches have been developed. Firstly, the tensor \nnature of the susceptibility allows the dependence of the signal polarization on the \npolarizations of the incident laser beams to be exploited in order to suppress the non-resonant \nbackground [138, 163, 164]. A second possibility is to use short-pulse lasers in the pico-\nsecond regime and to delay the probe laser relative to the pump and Stokes pulses. Since the \nnon-resonant contributions occur only when all laser beams are coincident they decay rapidly \nwith increasing probe delay. The Raman coherence in contrast has a certain life-time and so \nthe resonant signal may be generated after a suitable delay to suppress the non-resonant \nbackground [165-167]. In this case however the J-dependent collisional dephasing must be \ntaken into account as it affects the temperature derived from time-delayed CARS spectra \n[168]. \nWithout electronically resonant enhancement CARS has been used to measure concentrations \nof flame intermediates. This approach however provides only limited sensitivity and detection \nof trace species such as radicals is not possible. As a consequence, intermediates can be \ndetected only if present in a comparatively high concentration i.e. in the order of about 1% as \nit is the case for carbon monoxide and hydrogen [129, 169-171]. For minor species detection \ni.e. when the concentration is far below 1%, the electronically resonant enhancement is \nnecessary. Detection limits have been estimated in some of the previously mentioned work. \nAttal et al. [148] gave a detection limit of 1010 molecules\/cm3 for C2 and a similar number \nwas found by Doerk et al. [150] for CH radicals. At elevated pressure Attal et al. calculated a \ndetection sensitivity of 6 ppm for OH at atmospheric pressure and 60 ppm at 10 bar [144]. \nRecent work by Lucht and co-workers has focused on NO and C2H2 measurements employing \nthe ERE-CARS approach. Nascent NO concentrations were measured in a hydrogen\/air flame \nand, by using polarization suppression of the non-resonant background, in a sooting \nacetylene\/air flame, both stabilized on a Hencken burner [157]. Quantitative ERE-CARS \nmeasurements were made by calibration using NO seeded into the hydrogen\/air flame. In \n 73\norder to obtain sufficient signal levels down to concentrations of 50 ppm the Raman \ncoherence was excited using 12 and 15 mJ of laser pulse energy in the pump (at 532 nm) and \nStokes (at 591 nm) beams respectively. The coherence was probed with a electronically \nresonant UV laser pulse at 236 nm. In a follow-up study a third flame environment - a \nhydrogen\/air counter-flow flame, was investigated in which spatially resolved NO \nconcentrations were measured in good agreement with numerical simulations [158]. These \nstudies used a narrowband Stokes laser necessitating scanning of the laser frequency to obtain \nthe NO spectra. Later work, employing a broadband dye laser as Stokes source, succeeded in \nrecording single-shot measurements which also agreed well with the predicted NO \nconcentrations [159]. The frequency scanning method was used for acetylene detection by \nERE-CARS in a nitrogen flow with small amounts of acetylene as well as in a pressure vessel \n[160]. At ambient conditions a detection limit of some 25 ppm was reported. The result from \na calibration measurement at atmospheric pressure is displayed in fig. 5.4 showing the square \nroot of CARS signal intensity plotted against acetylene concentration. Further experiments at \nelevated pressure revealed that with increasing pressure the spectral data showed increasing \ndeviations from theoretically calculated spectra. The discrepancy may be attributed to the lack \nof a suitable model for collisional narrowing in the numerical code used to simulate the \nspectra. In some cases the quadratic dependence on number density may not be strictly \nobserved. When the signal concerned is the integrated signal over the linewidth then pressure \nbroadening or narrowing effects may lead to a deviation from an N2 dependence [172]. \nCoherent transient signals such as those generated by shaped ultrashort pulses may also lead \nto deviations from N2 behaviour [173]. \n \n 74\n \nFigure 5.4: Square root of integrated C2H2 ERE-CARS signal as a function of C2H2 concentration in a jet flow \nat 1 atm. A typical error bar of 10% is shown at a concentration of 500 ppm. (Figure reproduced with \npermission from reference [160].) \n \n \n 75\n6 Laser-induced grating spectroscopy \nDuring the DFWM process, as outlined in section 3.2, collisional quenching during molecular \nexcitation can lead to a grating induced in the bulk properties of the medium. This laser-\ninduced grating, LIG, leads to scattering of the probe generating a \u201cparasitic\u201d signal [174-176]. \nAn unsaturated DFWM signal, based on molecular excitation, dramatically decreases with \nincreasing pressure. On the other hand the LIG signal based on quenching of the molecular \nexcited state population increases at higher pressures and so constitutes a growing \ninterference in high pressure situations. This new signal, since it is sensitive to bulk properties \nsuch as temperature and pressure, potentially provides a useful diagnostic technique \nparticularly for high pressure applications. Scattering from this laser induced grating is \nenhanced when the pump beams are resonant with a molecular absorption and so forms the \nbasis of a spectroscopic technique \u2013 Laser Induced Grating Spectroscopy, LIGS. The basic \nphysics involves the generation of a grating-like modulation of the medium refractive index as \na result of sudden heating and\/or compression by pulsed interfering pump beams. The \nmodulation of the density arising from the heating in the high field regions of the interference \npattern leads to a thermal grating. This thermal grating consists of two components. On the \none hand there is a stationary pattern of density modulation arising from the change in \ntemperature \u2013 a \u201ctemperature grating\u201d. This arises from the heat deposition by absorption of \nradiation energy at the regions of high intensity in the interference pattern. Secondly, \nassociated with this sudden density modulation an acoustic wave expands from the high field \nregions i.e. the antinodes of the induced grating pattern. The grating structure of the induced \npattern leads to two plane acoustic waves propagating in opposite directions normal to the \ngrating planes. The result is a standing wave oscillation (created by the adiabatic \ncompression) superimposed on the stationary temperature grating (resulting from isobaric \nheating). Usually the acoustic grating and the temperature grating are of similar amplitude. \n 76\nThe stationary temperature grating decays exponentially owing to thermal diffusion and the \nacoustic waves decay exponentially by viscous damping effects. [see figure 6.1(a)] The \ndynamics of the grating can be detected by scattering a probe beam incident at the Bragg \nangle to the grating planes. Provided the probe beam is essentially constant in intensity during \nthe lifetime of the grating the temporal variation of the scattered signal beam reveals the \ntemporal behaviour of the laser induced grating. Typically the LIGS signal will appear as a \nrapidly increasing intensity followed by an oscillatory exponential decay as in figure 6.1(b). \n \na b  \nFigure 6.1: (a) Contributions to the induced grating from the stationary temperature grating \u2013 a decaying \nexponential (dashed line) and the perturbation from the acoustic waves (dotted line). The solid line shows the \ntotal density perturbation. (b) LIGS excitation by short laser pulse (dotted line) leading to excited molecular \nstate population (dashed line) and the signal generated from the resulting Laser Induced Thermal Grating \nScattering, LITGS (solid line). \n \nA LIGS signal can be created even in the absence of a molecular absorption since non-\nresonant light, of sufficient intensity, may also modulate the refractive index by the \nphenomenon of electrostriction [177]. In this case acoustic waves are generated by the sudden \ndensity modulation arising from electrostriction in the antinodes of the grating pattern. In this \ncase however the stationary temperature grating is very weak [178, 179]. Since the stationary \ngrating is usually negligible compared to the acoustic grating the signal arising from the \nacoustic oscillations appear on a zero background, rather than an exponentially decaying \nbackground of similar amplitude. The result is that these signals oscillate at twice the \nfrequency as those from absorptive or thermal gratings. In this paper we will concentrate on \n 77\nresonant LIGS since it provides species selectivity as well as diagnostic potential for bulk \nproperties such as temperature, pressure and velocity. \nThe experimental arrangement to realise LIGS is similar to that used for DFWM in the FPG. \nSince the readout of the signal arises from scattering off a bulk material property \u2013 the gas \ndensity modulation \u2013 there is no requirement for the probe to be resonant with a molecular \ntransition. The only requirement is that the probe of wavelength \u03bb is incident at the \nappropriate angle \u03b8 to the grating to satisfy the Bragg condition for scattering (see equation \n3.8). A typical experimental arrangement is shown in figure 6.2. Usually the pump pulses are \nprovided by nanosecond duration tunable lasers e.g. dye lasers excited by Q-switched \nNd:YAG lasers, and a cw laser such as an Argon ion laser is used to provide the probe beam. \nOther experimental approaches will be detailed below but first the physics underlying the \ngrating dynamics will be outlined to show the potential for LIGS as a quantitative diagnostic \ntechnique. It is also important to understand LIGS processes so that steps may be taken to \nmitigate their interference in DFWM applications. Thermal gratings have also been identified \nas requiring suppression in some cases of Polarization Spectroscopy [180]. \nLIGS based on thermal gratings arising from absorption on a molecular resonance is similar \nto DFWM that also arises from resonant enhancement on molecular transitions. As noted \nabove, in a typical DFWM experiment a signal may also arise from LIGS. The DFWM signal \nis generated by scattering (or diffraction) off a grating composed of the spatially modulated \nrefractive index caused by changes in the molecular state populations. This modulation in the \ncomplex refractive index is tied to the coherently driven molecular oscillations and so decays \nrapidly once the driving fields are turned off. The coherence decay time is usually set by \ndephasing collisions and is typically in the picosecond regime in gases. Thus if the third field \nis delayed by more than the coherence decay time then no signal will be generated. In practice, \nfor nanosecond pump pulses DFWM signals are detectable only when the probe pulse is \nessentially simultaneous with the pump pulses. In the case of LIGS however the grating \n 78\nresponsible for the scattering or diffraction of the probe is produced in the bulk properties of \nthe medium rather than the molecular quantum states. The decay of the grating in this case is \ndetermined by the gas dynamic properties such as thermal diffusivity and viscosity which are \nmany orders of magnitude slower than coherence decay times. Consequently the grating \ninduced by a LIGS process survives for timescales of the order of microseconds after the \nincident pump laser pulses have disappeared. Thus LIGS signals may be generated by probe \nbeams arriving after the pump pulses up to several microseconds delay. In many applications \na cw probe beam is used. A further difference between DFWM and LIGS is that in the former \nthe pump and probe beams are of the same frequency (degenerate) since all three beams use \nthe same molecular resonance enhancement. In the case of LIGS the only constraint on the \nfrequency of the probe is that the wavelength meets the Bragg condition for diffraction from \nthe grating determined by the pump wavelength and crossing angle. The use of a different \nwavelength probe in LIGS facilitates discrimination against scattered pump light by use of \noptical filters. There is also a two-colour variant of DFWM where the probe and pump beams \nshare one common level but use resonance enhancement on different transitions. As in \nDFWM such signals are coherent and require pump and probe to be overlapped in time, or at \nleast delayed by no more than the coherence decay time. \n \n \n 79\n \nFigure 6.2: Schematic of typical experimental layout for LIGS. Part of the probe laser shown as a dotted line is \nused as a guide to the direction of the signal on to the photomultiplier detector PMT. \n \n6.1 Fundamentals and theory of LIGS \n6.1.1 Basic theory \nThe time behaviour of LIGS signals is characterised by the growth and decay of the induced \ngratings. In some cases the grating may be considered to appear instantaneously and so the \nsignal shows a single sided exponential decay with superimposed, decaying, acoustic \noscillations. In general however the signal is determined by the rate at which thermal energy \nis deposited by quenching leading to a growth in signal intensity and simultaneous decay \nprocesses which eventually reduce the signal to zero. The dynamics of the grating growth and \ndecay have been treated theoretically by Cummings and coworkers [181, 182], by Paul et al. \n[175], and Hemmerling and coworkers [179, 183]. A useful introduction to the physics of \nlaser induced gratings is given in the textbook by Eichler et al. [184]. We follow the treatment \npresented by Paul et al. to outline the essential theoretical method and refer the reader to the \noriginal papers for further mathematical details. \nWe consider the grating to be formed in the yz-plane by two parallel polarized plane waves of \nwavelength \u03bb propagating at a small angle 2\u03b8\u00b1  to a symmetry axis in the yz-plane. The \n 80\ngrating fringe separation \u039b is therefore given by equation 3.8. The number density of excited \nmolecules *N  is given, under non-saturating conditions, by a rate equation: \n2\n*2\n*\n*\n)(),(),()]\/2cos(1[2\nx\nNDNQAdxftgxBNE\nt\nN\nLP \u2202\n\u2202++\u2212\u039b+=\u2202\n\u2202 \u03c4\u03c0  (6.1)\nwhere equation EP is the total energy in each pump pulse, B is the Einstein coefficient and N \nis the density of absorbing molecules. g(t, L\u03c4 ) and f(x,d) are the normalized temporal and \nspatial profiles where L\u03c4  is the pump laser pulse duration and d the pump beam spot size in \nthe x-direction. The terms A and Q indicate the rate of loss of excited state population density \nby spontaneous emission (Einstein A-coefficient) and quenching respectively. Finally, the \nloss of excited population density by diffusion from the excitation volume in the x-direction is \ngiven by the coefficient D. The input of thermal energy to the system from quenching is \nrepresented by a fraction \u03b5 of the absorbed energy i.e. \u2217QNo\u03c9\u03b5h , where \u03c9o is the absorption \ntransition frequency. \nThe subsequent dynamics of the grating evolution are described using a characteristic length \nand time to provide dimensionless units for the governing equations. The normalized units \nare: \u03c4\u03b6\ntt =)(  and \u039b=\nxx)(\u03be , where \u03c4 \uf020 is the transit time across the grating spacing \noc\u039b=\u03c4 for the acoustic waves travelling at the sound speed co. The essential physics is \ndescribed by treating the grating planes as infinite in transverse extent (yz-plane) and, for \ntypical conditions of grating spacing \u039b and gas viscosity, the Reynolds number for the flow is \nlarge. Thus for such an invicid, one dimensional flow the grating evolution may be described \nby a set of linearized hydrodynamic equations [44]: \n 81\n0'' =\u2202\n\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03be\u03b6\n\u03c1 u  (6.2)\n0'\nRe3\n4'1'\n2\n2\n=\u2202\n\u2202\u2212\u2202\n\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03be\u03be\u03b3\u03b6\nuPu  (6.3)\noo\no\nP\nN\nc\nQPP ),(1''\nPrRe\n1''1\n2\n2\n2\n2 \u03be\u03b6\u03c9\u03b5\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u03be\n\u03c1\n\u03be\u03b6\n\u03c1\n\u03b6\u03b3\n\u2217\u039b\u2212=\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2202\n\u2202\u2212\u2202\n\u2202\n\u22c5\u2212\u2202\n\u2202\u2212\u2202\n\u2202 h  (6.4)\nThese equations describe the evolution of the normalized density perturbation o\u03c1\u03c1\u03c1 \u0394=' , \nvelocity ocuu \u0394=' and pressure oPPP \u0394=' and involve the fluid dynamic parameters of the \nReynolds number \u03bc\u03c1ooc \u039b=Re  and Prandtl number KCp \u03bc=Pr , where \u03bc is the dynamic \nviscosity and K is the thermal conductivity.

The overall temporal response )(\u03b6Z  \nis simply the convolution of this instantaneous response )(\u03b6W with )(\u03b6h which is the \ntemporal profile of the excited state population, and hence the thermal input into the medium. \nThe medium response )(\u03b6W  can be written as, \n)cos()exp(2)exp()( 211 \u03c6\u03b6\u03b6\u03b6\u03b6 +\u2212\u2212= vuasaW  (6.7)\nThe constants vuasa ,,,, 211  and \u03c6 are found to depend on \u03b3, Re and Pr. From the form of this \nsolution we see that the medium response and hence the scattered signal will have two terms. \nThe first represents a stationary thermal grating decaying exponentially by heat conduction. \nThe second represents two counter-propagating acoustic waves decaying due to the medium \nviscosity. \n6.1.2 Analysis of LIGS signals, practical considerations \nIn order to derive values of thermodynamic parameters from experimentally recorded LIGS \nsignals it is necessary to have a quantitative understanding of how the signals depend on the \nparameter to be measured. A theoretical LIGS signal can then be calculated using the model \noutlined above and fitted to the experimental data using the value of the unknown parameter \nas fitting variable. Analytical solutions for the evolution of the laser-induced grating may be \nfound using the methods of Cummings [181] and Paul et al. [175] provided two simplifying \nassumptions are made. Firstly, the grating must be established in a time much shorter than the \nacoustic oscillation period, \u03c4a. Secondly, the medium must have a large Reynolds number, \n 83\nRe>>1. In practice the condition for Re is usually satisfied but it can be much more difficult \nto ensure that the grating is produced in a time shorter than \u03c4a. Typical values of \u03c4a are in the \nregion of tens of ns but the quenching times that determine the rate of heat deposition in the \nmedium may exceed 100 ns. Furthermore the duration of pump pulses derived from Q-\nswitched lasers are also on the order of \u03c4a. In general therefore the source function must be \nevaluated by a convolution of the various contributions. The source function must then be \nconvolved with the grating decay function. When these convolutions involve arbitrary \nfunctions a numerical solution is usually required. A further problem arises from the disparate \ntime scales of the different functions ranging over several orders of magnitude. Evaluations of \nsuch convolutions constitute a computationally stiff problem. The problem is compounded if \nthe calculation is to be used in a fitting routine that requires rapid evaluation to achieve a best \nfit in a reasonable time. \nOne approach to the problem is to use short pulse lasers and contrive to ensure rapid \nquenching, for example by operating at high pressures with efficient quenching gases. Clearly \nthis approach is not generally applicable. Another approach is to focus only on the acoustic \nfrequency and parameters derivable from this measurement [185]. Approximate analytical \nsolutions to specific problems have been derived by Hemmerling and Kozlov who treated the \ncase of LIGS in pure oxygen arising from quenching of the +\u03a3 gB1  state following \ninstantaneous excitation [186]. They considered a significant number of quenching \nmechanisms and channels in a complex analysis involving ~24 non-orthogonal variables \nrelated by non-trivial expressions. The results were found to be consistent with experimental \nobservations but were obtained at some cost in analytical complexity. It is not clear that the \nanalysis could be easily generalized. There is therefore a premium for finding a robust and \nefficient method of data analysis that may be generally applicable even if some compromise \nmust be made in absolute accuracy. \n 84\nAn alternative to analysing LIGS signals in terms of the above theory in the time domain is to \ntransform everything to the frequency or Fourier domain [187]. We have noted that the \nhydrodynamic equations were solved by Laplace transform methods and in the case of a \ndelta-function excitation in the time domain at 0)( =t\u03b6 the solutions using Fourier transforms \nare identical. By suitably redefining the limits of integration the Laplace transforms are \nchanged to Fourier transforms and the analysis is then carried on in the Fourier or frequency \ndomain [188]. The time dependence of the grating or grating impulse function can therefore \nbe expressed in the Fourier domain and convolutions with the source functions involving the \nquenching and excitation rates can be readily evaluated. Comparison with experimental data \ncan be carried out in the Fourier domain also by transforming the recorded LIGS signal using \ndiscrete Fourier transformation. This procedure has the great advantage that efficient FFT \nprograms are available that allow rapid calculation of model LIGS signals and subsequent \nfitting using well established numerical methods [187]. \nThe theory outlined above shows that the LIGS signal is generated by coherent scattering i.e. \ndiffraction from the grating arising from a density perturbation '\u03c1\u0394  and its associated \nmodulation of the refractive index \u0394n. The diffraction efficiency of the grating, probesig II , is \nproportional to 2n\u0394  and so the detected signal is proportional to 2)'(\u03c1 where '\u03c1  is given by \nequation 6.5. From this we see that the signal is proportional to the square of the lower state \npopulation density, N. Thus as the pump laser is scanned across the spectrum the relative \nintensity of the signal will give a measure of the relative quantum state populations and so the \ntemperature could, in principle, be derived from the LIGS spectrum. Care however needs to \nbe exercised. The relative signal strength depends also on the quenching rate and this may \nvary with rotational quantum number, J. Fortunately the LIGS signal contains a wealth of \nother information from which temperature and other parameters can be derived. We consider \nnow the parameters that may be derived from measurement of LIGS signals. \n 85\n \nAccurate and precise temperature measurements may be made using LIGS by analysing the \ntime behaviour of the signal. As noted above, as the acoustic waves traverse the stationary \ngrating at the speed of sound, oc , the LIGS signal oscillates at a frequency given by the \ninverse of the fringe transit time oc\u039b=\u03c4 . Thus if the grating spacing \u039b is known the speed \nof sound may be derived from the oscillation frequency. Provided the composition of the gas \nis reasonably accurately known the sound speed may then be used to derive the temperature \nusing the relation mo MRTc \u03b3= , where Mm is the mean molecular mass. Since frequencies \nmay be measured with considerably more precision than relative intensities, this provides a \nmore precise measurement of temperature than scanning the LIGS spectrum [189]. The \naccuracy of the measurement depends on accurate knowledge of the gas composition and the \nthermodynamic properties of the constituents. In many cases the composition is well known \nor measurable and the gas dynamic properties may be obtained from the literature. The \ngrating spacing \u039b may either be measured directly or derived from a temperature \nmeasurement under calibrated conditions. \nThe temporal evolution and decay of the LIGS signal is described by the response function \n)(\u03b6W in equation 6.7. The exponential decay of the signal is thus determined by gas dynamic \nproperties, \u03b3, Re and Pr, and pressure. Therefore, again provided the gas composition is \nknown and the associated gas dynamic parameters, the pressure may be derived from \nmeasurement of the signal decay rate. Thus LIGS provides a remote, non-contact, method to \nmeasure gas pressure.  \nThe rate at which thermal energy is deposited in the gas is determined by the quenching rate \nQ. In principle therefore Q can also be derived from the temporal behaviour of the signal if \nother gas dynamic parameters are known. Whereas the long-time exponential decay of the \n 86\nsignal is sensitive to pressure it is the initial rise in the signal that is most sensitive to the \nquenching rate Q. \nFinally we note, as mentioned above, the integrated signal intensity will be proportional to the \ninitial molecular state population and so to the absorber concentration. We see therefore that \nthe LIGS signal contains information on temperature, pressure, quenching rates and absorber \nconcentration. Measurements of these parameters may be made using only a single pulse and \nso high temporal resolution is inherent with this LIGS technique and is set by the duration of \nthe signal pulses. Typically LIGS signals last a few \u00b5sec which is usually a short time \ncompared to the time scales involved in combustion. The spatial resolution is determined by \nthe size of the interaction volume. This may not be decreased arbitrarily as the transit of the \nacoustic waves out of the interaction volume causes faster decay of the acoustic oscillations. \nAlthough this effect can be included in the model the reduction in the number of oscillations \nthat can be measured limits the precision of the temperature measurement.  \nWe have noted that the basic assumptions of the LIGS theory are often well satisfied viz. an \nideal fluid with high Reynolds number and rapid grating production relative to the acoustic \ntransit time. In general, however, the application of the theory is limited in other respects. It \nhas been tacitly assumed that the medium is isotropic and homogeneous but this may not be \nthe case in turbulent flames where the temperature, pressure, composition and velocity fields \nmay not be uniform in space or time. For example steep temperature or concentration \ngradients may exist and so the problem may not be reducible to one-dimension nor to have \nsolutions separable in space and time. As with DFWM saturation of the absorbing transition \nwill also have to be considered especially with focussed pump beams. Saturation will lead to a \nnonlinear response and a distortion of the induced grating from a pure cosinusoidal \nmodulation. Evidence of such distortion can be observed in Fourier transformation of the \nLIGS signals as higher harmonics on the fundamental acoustic frequency [188]. Other \npractical issues have been addressed including the effects of opacity of the medium [190], \n 87\nfinite grating extent [182], Gaussian beam profiles [191], and the one dimensional model has \nbeen extended to 3-dimensions [192]. \n6.2 Molecular physics applications \nSince the physics of LIGS critically involves the quenching of molecular excited states the \ntechnique seems well suited to the study of relaxation dynamics. This was first demonstrated \nfor gas phase studies by Hemmerling and co-workers [193, 194] and the work of this group \nhas been reviewed some years ago [195]. The detailed analysis of the internal relaxation \nchannels in even the relatively simple case of a diatomic molecule such as O2 proved to be a \ncomplex matter as outlined above [186]. Binary mixtures of O2 and CO2 have been studied by \nHubschmid [196]. Relaxation studies of C2H4 and NH3 have been carried out by comparing \nexperimental LIGS signals obtained in the infra-red using chance coincidences of molecular \nresonances with certain lines of a CO2 laser with signals calculated using a simple \nthermalization model [197]. Similar thermalization studies using LIGS have been done on \nNO2 in the visible region of the spectrum [198]. Related LIGS variants have been employed, \nfor example, to study NO [199] and atomic hydrogen [200]. \nSpectroscopy of overtone transitions is a powerful means of studying the dynamics of \nmolecules in ro-vibrational states containing substantial amounts of internal energy. Such \nexcited states are often involved in chemical reactions and exist as reaction intermediates in \ncombustion processes. Vibrational overtones of O-H in water vapour were studied to \nunderstand the contribution of various grating forming mechanisms [201]. Weak overtone and \ncombination bands of methane were detected using LIGS at pressures ranging from 0.2 to 4 \nbar showing that the technique was capable of detecting transitions with cross-sections as low \nas 10-26 cm2molecule-1 [202]. \nThe excitation of thermal gratings in molecules has usually been achieved by single photon \nresonant transitions using lasers in the spectral regions ranging from the UV to the IR. In \n 88\ncases where molecular excitation cannot be achieved using single photon transitions with \nexisting laser sources two-photon or Raman pumping may be used to populate excited ro-\nvibrational states. Kozlov and co-workers have demonstrated such an excitation by \nsimultaneously generating spatially overlapping grating patterns using two lasers of \nwavelength chosen to achieve the stimulated Raman pumping [203, 204]. By exciting \ntransitions in the Q-branches of the \u03bd1\/2\u03bd Fermi dyad in CO2 it was possible to investigate \nmolecular energy transfer processes. The important feature of this technique is that such \nvibrational excitation is not possible by conventional absorption spectroscopy. Rotational \nexcitation by Raman pumping involves much smaller Stokes frequency differences and so can \nbe achieved using a single broad bandwidth laser. The radiation at the pump and the Stokes \nfrequencies are both present within the broad bandwidth laser output and so the rotational \nRaman excitation is achieved using only one laser. Such LIGS excitation of rotational Raman \npumping has also been demonstrated for N2, CO2, and C3H8 under stationary conditions in a \ngas cell at pressures up to 5 bar [205]. \n6.3 Concentration measurements and thermometry applications \nThe selective detection of minor molecular species in combustion using LIGS is based on the \nresonant absorption of energy by tuning the pump laser to accessible electronic and ro-\nvibrational transitions. A range of stable species and radicals have been detected in this way \nincluding NO [118, 182], NO2 [181, 187, 198, 206, 207], OH [175, 208, 209], H2O [119, 201, \n210, 211], and NH3. Fuel species such as CH4 [202], C2H4 [197], CH3OH [176] and C3H8 \n[212, 213] have also been detected but in combustion situations these are usually present in \nrelatively large concentrations. Nonetheless it may be useful to consider LIGS for detection of \nfuel compounds as they may be present as unburned hydrocarbons in exhaust gases. So far it \nhas not been demonstrated that absolute concentration measurements can be reliably deduced \n 89\nfrom measured LIGS signals without some calibration and restriction to conditions not too far \nremoved from those of the calibration measurements. \nA major motivation for detection of minor species is the measurement of temperature in \nflames or post-flame gases. Thermometry using LIGS has the potential for higher precision \nthan is possible using CARS. The precision of CARS thermometry is typically limited by the \nnoise of the recorded spectrum and the ability to accurately fit a theoretical spectrum to the \ndata. Thus the precision is determined by errors in a measurement of intensity. The precision \nof LIGS however is determined by the errors in determining a frequency. Frequency \nmeasurements are typically more precise than intensity measurements. For example, \nprecisions of single-shot CARS measurements under optimum conditions using a single-mode \npump laser and modeless Stokes are of order 2-5% [115]. In comparison a single-shot \nprecision of <0.2% has been reported using LIGS [187]. It is also worth noting that the signal \nanalysis to derive a temperature using LIGS is much simpler than the relatively complex \nspectral fitting routines required for CARS. In the case of LIGS all that is needed is the \nmeasurement of the acoustic oscillation frequency, from which the speed of sound is readily \ncalculated and hence, for known gas composition, the temperature is easily found. \nFurthermore, since it is sensitive to minor species, it can also be used in flames or engines \nwhere no suitable Raman-active species is present. An early attempt to use laser-induced \ngratings was based on the rate of decay of a very small spaced grating written by picosecond \npump pulses in atomic sodium seeded to a flame [214]. The temperature was derived from the \ndiffusion rate of the atoms based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. As noted above, \nhowever, temperature may be derived more precisely from the measurement of the acoustic \noscillation frequency of the LIGS signal provided the gas composition is known [181]. Basing \nthe measurement on a frequency determination makes the technique relatively insensitive to \nintensity fluctuations. Although the potential for using LIGS for thermometry was recognised \nat an early stage [175, 181] initial studies focussed on elucidating the dynamics of the grating \n 90\nevolution and its dependence on gas dynamic parameters. The potential for measurement of \ntemperature and pressure was realized first by Latzel et al. [209] who recorded LIGS signals \ngenerated on the A2\u03a0-X2\u03a0(0,0) band of OH in a high pressure flame. Values of temperature \nand pressure were derived from fits of theoretical simulations to the experimental LIGS \nsignals over a range 10 to 40 bar and for different stoichiometric conditions (see figure 6.3). \nThe values obtained were in good agreement with independent temperature measurements \nusing N2 CARS and predictions from a one-dimensional flame calculation. These and similar \nexperiments by other workers used pulsed excitation by a Nd:YAG pumped dye laser and a \ncw Argon ion laser as the probe. Use of a cw probe limits the signal since with a total power \nof typically ~1 W and for gratings lasting of order 10-6 s only 1\u03bcJ will be available for \nscattering into the signal. Improved sensitivity was obtained by replacing the cw probe by a \nlong pulse from a flashlamp-pumped dye laser having peak powers in the range of 106 W. \n[187]. Measurements on trace amounts of NO2 in N2 at high pressures in static cells achieved \na temperature precision of 0.1%. The accuracy and precision of pressure measurement was \n~2% limited by uncertainties in the published values of gas dynamic parameters for NO2 and \nN2 mixtures. LIGS thermometry in harsh combustion environments has been demonstrated by \nBrown and Roberts showing that the technique was feasible even in turbulent and sooting \nflames [215]. Hart et al. performed LIGS measurements of pressure, temperature and velocity \nin a supersonic air flow seeding NO2 as a tracer species for the excitation of thermal gratings \n[216]. \n \n 91\n \nFigure 6.3: LIGS signal from OH in high pressure methane\/air flame at 40 bar. The temperature derived from \nthe fit to the data is 2014 K. (Figure reproduced with permission from reference [209].) \n \nAll of the LIGS measurements discussed so far were confined to point-like interaction \nvolumes defined by the crossing geometry of the pump beams. Extension of the technique to \nmeasurements along a line is discussed in section 9. \n \nTo conclude, measurements on minor species using LIGS are possible because of the strong \nabsorption presented by electronic or ro-vibrational transitions in molecules. Analysis of the \nsignals can, in principle, yield several parameters important for combustion such as \ntemperature, pressure as well as species concentration. The main problem in the derivation of \nsuch quantities lies in the uncertainty in gas dynamic parameters especially in gas mixtures of \nunknown composition. Where, however, the unknown species represent only a very small \nproportion of the mixture, reasonable estimates may be made. \nThe advantages of LIGS as a probe of minor species lie with the sensitivity arising from \nstrong resonant absorptions. This sensitivity is also dependent on the quenching processes that \ntransfer the energy to the thermal grating and so the signal strength often increases with \nincreasing pressure unlike in the case of DFWM or PS. The technique thus has potential for \napplication in high pressure combustion and engine situations. Since the probe and signal \n 92\nlight is at a different wavelength from the pump radiation discrimination against scattered \npump light is facilitated and this provides typically high signal-to-noise ratios. The limitations \nof using low power cw probe lasers can potentially be overcome by using higher power \npulsed lasers having sufficiently long pulse durations to span the lifetime of the induced \ngratings. Practical matters that need attention include the availability of short pulse lasers with \nsufficient energy for fast pumping of the thermal grating, intense and stable probe beams with \nsufficient power and good transverse beam quality to generate reliable and noise-free signals. \nFuture applications of LIGS may involve simultaneous use of DFWM and LIGS to extend \nmeasurements over the wide pressure ranges involved in reciprocating engines. Precise and \naccurate measurements of species concentrations, fuel\/air ratios, temperature and pressure on \na cycle resolved basis can be envisaged. \n 93\n7 Polarization spectroscopy \nPolarization spectroscopy is similar to DFWM in many respects. The two most common \noptical layouts for recording PS spectra are shown in fig. 7.1. The essential item is a laser \nproviding a linearly polarized output that is frequency tunable in the region of transitions of \nthe species of interest. A beam splitter is used to generate a strong pump beam and a weak \nprobe beam. Often a simple glass plate with a typical reflectivity of several percent is \nemployed for this purpose. The pump and probe beams are made to intersect thus defining the \ninteraction region or measurement volume. The probe beam passes through a linear polarizer \nbefore reaching the interaction region and then through a crossed polarizer, or analyzer, \nbefore reaching the detector. Since the analyzer is at 90o to the polarizer the detector does not \nsee any signal when the pump beam is blocked. When the pump however also passes through \nthe interaction region optical pumping produces an optical anisotropy in the medium. The \nresulting birefringence and dichroism leads to a polarization rotation and ellipticity of the \npolarization state of the probe beam. As a result of this polarization change in the probe, part \nof it can pass the analyzer and reach the photo-detector. In the pump beam a half-wave plate \nor quarter-wave plate is inserted before it intersects the probe beam. A half-wave plate rotates \nthe linear polarization direction so that the pump and probe are either orthogonally polarized \nor at 45\u00b0 angle in order to optimize signal intensity. A quarter-wave plate on the other hand \ngenerates a circularly polarized pump beam. In the first case the signal of Q-branch transitions \nis enhanced according to the appropriate selection rules while in the second case strong signal \nintensities from R- and P-branches are observed.  \nNote that polarization spectroscopy is a form of saturation spectroscopy. However, in contrast \nto saturation spectroscopy, where the modulation of the absorption behaviour is detected \nagainst a large background due to the residual transmission of the probe, the signal in PS is \ndetected against an essentially zero background. Since in PS the background is eliminated by \n 94\nthe crossed polarizers a significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio and thereby a much better \nsensitivity is obtained. \nInterestingly, in contrast to the other four-wave mixing techniques, in PS only two beams \nneed to be aligned as two photons are taken from the pump laser beam to drive the four-wave \nmixing interaction. This simplifies the experiment significantly since phase matching is \nautomatically achieved at any crossing angle owing to the fact that the signal beam follows \nexactly the direction of the probe beam. The interaction of the pump and probe beams can be \ndone in a forward or backward configuration as illustrated in fig. 7.1 to provide Doppler-\nbroadened or Doppler-free signals, respectively. Depending on the spectral linewidth of the \nlaser the signal intensity can be several orders of magnitude stronger in the forward \narrangement. This can be explained by recognizing that the atoms or molecules contribute to \nthe signal only when they \u201csee\u201d the pump and probe laser at the same frequency. When the \nbeams are co-propagating the Doppler shift arising from molecular motion will be the same \nfor both pump and probe beams. Thus all the molecules, independent of the direction they \nmove, see the same frequency and can contribute to the signal generation. In contrast, when \nthe beams are counter-propagating only the molecules that have a zero velocity component \nalong both beams will experience the same light frequency. Thus only those molecules that \nare stationary or moving perpendicularly to both beams interact to produce a signal. When \nnarrowband single-mode lasers are employed the signal is generated by an extremely small \nvelocity-subgroup and consequently the signal intensity is reduced significantly. \n \n 95\n \nFigure 7.1: Basic optical layout for PS in (a) forward pump geometry and (b) backward pump geometry. P and \nA indicate the polarizer and analyzer respectively. \n \nPolarization spectroscopy was first introduced in 1976 by Wieman and H\u00e4nsch as a sub-\nDoppler method, related to saturation spectroscopy, but offering a much improved signal-to-\nbackground ratio [217]. In their work the Balmer \u03b2-line of atomic hydrogen and deuterium \nwas studied by PS in a gas cell. Subsequent studies by H\u00e4nsch\u2019s group involved Na2 [218] \nand NO2 [219] molecules. The first flame experiments were reported in 1983 by Ernst who \ndetected flame-generated BaO and CaCl using PS [220]. In this section we present the \nfundamental theory of PS and review its applications for studying molecular physics of flame \nintermediates as well as quantitative measurements of species concentration and temperature \nin combustion environments. \n 96\n7.1 Theory of polarization spectroscopy \nThe basic theory of PS has been presented in detail in several articles and textbooks, see [16, \n219, 221, 222]. Therefore we give here only a brief introduction into the fundamentals in \norder to provide some further insights into the physics of PS. As mentioned above the \npumping induces an optical anisotropy in the medium leading to birefringence and dichroism \nresulting in changes in the refractive index n and the absorption coefficient \u03b1. The optical \nproperties of the anisotropic medium are now different for different polarization states of a \npropagating electromagnetic wave. Considering the linearly polarized probe beam \nmathematically as a sum of co-propagating right (superscript +) and left (superscript -) \ncircularly polarized beams of equal intensity, and accordingly introducing the corresponding \nabsorption coefficients \u03b1+ and \u03b1- and refractive indices n+ and n- the probe beam components \ncan be written \n( ){ }zzktiEE i ++++ +\u2212\u22c5= \u03b1\u03c9 20 exp  (7.1)\nand \n( ){ }zzktiEE i \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 +\u2212\u22c5= \u03b1\u03c9 20 exp  (7.2)\nPropagating through an intersection region with length L results in a phase difference \u0394\u03c6 \nbetween the two components \n( ) ( ) Lnn\nc\nLkk \u22c5\u2212\u22c5=\u22c5\u2212=\u0394 \u2212+\u2212+ \u03c9\u03c6  (7.3)\nas well as a difference in amplitude \n 97\n( ) ( ){ }LLEE \u2212+ \u2212\u2212\u2212\u22c5=\u0394 \u03b1\u03b1 21210 expexp2  (7.4)\nFor the sake of completeness it should be noted that this description has led to PS also being \nclassified as a modulation technique [16] rather than as a four-wave mixing process. \nA straightforward model to determine the PS signal intensity was developed by Teets et al. \n[219] and Zizak et al. [223] for the case of unsaturated or weakly saturated transitions. This \nmodel is based on a number of assumptions and simplifications. For instance, the repopulation \nof the initial energy state by spontaneous emission (fluorescence) and collisions (quenching) \nis neglected. In addition, the laser pulse duration is assumed to be shorter than the typical \nrelaxation time of the molecules, and the lifetime of the excited state must also be short in \norder to not contribute to the optical anisotropy. Introducing the differences in refractive \nindex and absorption coefficient as \u0394n = n+ - n- and \u0394\u03b1\uf020= \u03b1+ - \u03b1-, respectively, and assuming \nthat both \u0394n  << 1 and \u0394\u03b1 << 1, for a circularly polarized pump beam the signal intensity IPS \ntransmitted by the analyzer can be written [224]: \n( ) ( ) ( ) \u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u0394\u22c5\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b+\u0394\u22c5\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b+\u0394\u22c5+\u0394\u22c5+++= 2\n2\n2\n2\n22\n242\n1 n\nc\nLLbLn\nc\nLbII prPS\n\u03c9\u03b1\u03b1\u03b8\u03c9\u03b8\u03be\u03c9  (7.5)\nIn equation 7.5 Ipr represents the probe laser intensity, \u03be is the constant background due to the \nfinite extinction ratio of the polarizers and \u03b8 is the angular deviation from the ideal crossing \nangle of the polarizers. The parameter b accounts for additional birefringence effects that may \nfor example be caused by optical components such as cell windows between the two \npolarizers. A detailed discussion of such influences is given by Demtr\u00f6der [222]. \nIn practice the intensity equation can be further simplified. When open flames are investigated, \nwhich is typically the case in combustion studies, there are no additional optical components \nbetween polarizer and analyzer hence the parameter b can be neglected (b = 0). Furthermore, \n 98\nwhen the alignment of the polarizers is done carefully the angular deviation \u03b8 can also be \nneglected (\u03b8 = 0) and the intensity equation simplifies accordingly.

The same \nequation is obtained for the case of linearly polarized pump radiation. The main difference \nbetween using linearly and circularly polarized light in the pump beam is manifested in the \nabsorption behaviour.

The parameter \nba JJ\n\u03b6  eventually defines which \ntransitions or branches predominantly contribute to the PS signal. This is an interesting and \nimportant feature of PS in general. As already mentioned earlier circularly polarized pumping \ngenerates high signal intensities from P- and R-branches while Q-branch transitions are weak \nand vice versa for linearly polarized pumping. \nIn PS molecular or atomic transitions are excited resonantly thus saturation effects play an \nimportant role. In practice many experiments are conducted under saturating conditions for \n 100\nseveral reasons. High pump pulse energy leads to high signal intensity and the effects of \npulse-to-pulse intensity fluctuations are significantly reduced. When the linewidth is \ndominated by Doppler broadening (e.g. in high temperature flames) Reichardt et al. [221, \n225] proposed simplified expressions for the signal intensity in the unsaturated regime \n42\n2 11 \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u0394\u22c5\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u0394\u22c5\u22c5\u221d CDprp\ndunsaturate\nPS III \u03c9\u03c9  (7.13)\nand the saturated regime \n12\n11\n<\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u0394\u22c5\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u0394\u22c5\u221d CDpr\nsaturated\nPS II \u03c9\u03c9  (7.14)\nwhere \u0394\u03c9D and \u0394\u03c9C are the Doppler width and collisional broadening width respectively. In \nthe saturated regime it is clear that the signal intensity is no longer dependent on the pump \nlaser intensity. However, this approach developed by Reichardt and Lucht [221] is rather \ncomplicated as it is based on a direct numerical integration of the density matrix equations. \nAn alternative and less complex approach to describe the saturation behaviour in situations \nwhere homogeneous line broadening effects dominate was introduced by Walewski et al. \n[226] and results in the following phenomenological equation \n2\n2 \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n+\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5= satpp\np\nprPS II\nI\nNIAI  (7.15)\nwhere A is a fitting parameter, N is the number density of the species of interest and Ipsat is the \ntransition specific saturation pump intensity. Note that Ipsat is a different quantity from \nIPSsaturated. Whereas Ipsat is a fixed value for a particular spectroscopic line involving a physical \n 101\nmeaning, IPSsaturated is the signal intensity under saturated conditions that is detected in an \nexperiment. \n7.2 Molecular physics applications \nAs noted above, the first PS studies were performed in cells with the atomic or molecular \ngases or vapours of atomic hydrogen and deuterium [217], Na2 [218] and NO2 [219]. Flame \ngenerated BaO and CaCl were studied in situ by Ernst who obtained a remarkably good \nsignal-to-background ratio at low laser intensity and low pressure [220]. These experiments \nemployed continuous wave laser sources. In 1986 Zizak et al. demonstrated the applicability \nof a pulsed laser [223] by detecting ground-state sodium atoms seeded into a hydrogen flame. \nThe first application of PS to natural flames species was done by Nyholm and co-workers in \nthe 1990s studying OH radicals [224]. Suvernev et al. performed measurements of OH in \nmethane\/air and NH in ammonia\/oxygen\/nitrogen flames [227]. Further PS studies \ninvestigating combustion species in the ultraviolet and visible spectrum include detection of \nC2 [228, 229], NO [230, 231], CH [232] using resonance enhancement on single photon \ntransitions. Two-photon transitions were used to detect CO [233], NH3 [233] and N2 [234] \nsince excitation of electronic states of these molecules requires high energy. In the same way \ntransitions from the ground state of atomic hydrogen would also require two-photon \nexcitation [235]. Under certain circumstances however probing H atoms via two-photon PS \nbetween the ground and first excited state may be not practicable. For this reason two groups \ndeveloped approaches in which the H atoms are initially excited to the first excited electronic \nstate and then polarization spectroscopy is applied involving magnetic sublevels of the first \nand third excited states [236-238]. At first glance this method is rather complicated. However, \nas the two-photon transition can be achieved with radiation at 243nm and the subsequent \nsingle-photon PS can be performed using a laser at 486nm, the entire six-wave mixing process \n 102\ncan be done employing a single laser source delivering 486nm and frequency-doubling part of \nthe beam to 243nm. \nThe effect of leakage of light through the analyzing polarizer was studied by Nyholm et al. \n[228] for C2 by setting a nonzero crossing angle \u03b8 (recall eq. 7.5). While Lorentzian profiles \nof the R- and P-branch lines under investigation could be recorded with completely crossed \npolarizers, slightly uncrossing them resulted in a strong contribution of dispersive line shapes \nhence making an interpretation of the signals difficult or even impossible. In principle, this \nbehaviour is comparable to the interference of resonant and non-resonant signals in CARS \nwhich leads to highly non-symmetric line profiles. A more systematic and theoretical study of \nthis phenomenon was performed by Reichardt and Lucht [221] who calculated line profiles \nemploying direct numerical integration of the density matrix equations. Their results reveal \nthat a very small misalignment of the analyzer in the order of 0.1\u00b0 can exert a strong influence \non the line shape (see fig 7.2) and as a consequence affect the measurement. \n \n \nFigure 7.2: Calculated polarization spectroscopy line shapes for the R(4) resonance transition for three different \nvalues of the polarizer angle \u03b8 and pump beam intensity I1 = 107 W\/m2 and homogeneous linewidth Hv~\u0394  = \n0.053 cm-1. The number density n01 of the ground level is 2x1010 m-3 and the spontaneous emission coefficient \nA21 = 106 s-1. The absorption path length L is 5.0 mm. (Figure reproduced with permission from reference \n[221].) \n \n \n 103\nContemplating the above list of species, which have been studied by PS in the ultraviolet and \nvisible spectral region, one might notice that a large number of important flame species is \nmissing. Almost all hydrocarbons as well as the main combustion products water and carbon \ndioxide do not provide electronic transitions suitable for laser diagnostics at all. Needless to \nsay, knowledge of these species is still of utmost importance for understanding combustion \nprocesses. In order to overcome this problem PS was extended to the mid-infrared spectral \nrange, i.e. 1.5-5\u00b5m, where rovibrational modes can be probed. This development was made \npossible by the continuous progress in laser design in this spectral region in recent years. The \nfirst application of infrared polarization spectroscopy, IRPS, was demonstrated by Roy et al. \nin 2002 studying the 2.7\u00b5m band of CO2 [239]. Carbon dioxide was also investigated by \nAlwahabi et al. [240-243] who studied line-broadening, saturation and vibrational relaxation \neffects. As an example, the determination of collisional induced line-broadening coefficients \nof carbon dioxide [242] is illustrated in fig 7.3. To do this, high-resolution PS spectra were \nrecorded in binary CO2-argon and CO2-helium mixtures under non-saturating conditions. The \nradiation at 2\u00b5m wavelength was generated by frequency shifting the output from a single-\nlongitudinal mode alexandrite laser yielding an estimated spectral resolution below 300 MHz. \nLi et al. conducted the first flame experiments in this spectral region by detecting nascent CO2 \nand H2O at atmospheric pressure [244]. Further work on OH and H2O at high pressure \ninvestigated the problem of interferences from these species when detecting minor species in \nthis region of the infra-red spectrum [245]. \n \n 104\n \nFigure 7.3: Plot of the pressure broadened fitting parameter for CO2, \u0394\u03c9CO2-Ar, versus the ratio of ZCO2-CO2 over \nZCO2-Ar. The vertical error bars are three times the error values reported by the curve fitting routine. Based on \n1% error in the flow meters, the horizontal error bars represent three times the calculated error values of the \nquantity ZCO2-Ar\/ZCO2-CO2. The weighted least squares linear fitting is presented by the solid line. (Figure \nreproduced with permission from reference [242].) \n \nIn general strong interferences from the thermal emission in flame environments would be \nexpected to hinder the application of optical diagnostics in the infrared. The coherent nature \nof the four-wave mixing process, however, provides excellent discrimination against such \nbackground noise. \nIRPS has also been applied to detection of hydrocarbon molecules which are often referred to \nas dark species since they have no absorption spectra in the visible or UV spectral regions. \nSuch species are however of great interest not only as fuels but as intermediates during the \ndecomposition of fuel molecules as well as the formation of polycyclic aromatic compounds \nwhich are precursors of soot. Typically the stretching modes of CH moieties, which occur \naround 3000cm-1 (~3.3\u00b5m), are studied. The simplest hydrocarbon methane was investigated \nby Li et al. [246, 247] and Richard and Ewart [92]. Furthermore, Li et al. performed \nexperiments to study buffer gas influences on the PS signal level of ethane [247] and \nacetylene [248]. Their results reveal that the quenching rates for different buffer gases are of \nsimilar magnitude, which is a big difference to PS in the UV where the quenching cross-\n 105\nsections can vary orders of magnitude for different species. In a recent letter Li et al. \ndemonstrated the application of IRPS to detect nascent HCl in a CH4\/O2\/Ar flat flame where a \nsmall amount of chloroform was seeded into the Ar flow [249].\n \n7.3 Concentration measurements and thermometry applications \nPolarization spectroscopy has also been used to determine temperatures and the spatial \ndistribution and concentration of minor species in flames. C2 was detected in an \nacetylene\/oxygen flame using the Swan band system at 516.5nm with an estimated detection \nsensitivity of 1018m-3 [228]. For comparison a detection limit of 25ppm was estimated for OH \nat flame temperatures [224]. Mid-IR lasers were used by Li and co-workers for probing \nrovibrational transitions to obtain quantitative measurements of hydrocarbons [247, 248]. \nThey reported detections limits of 50 ppm for ethane and 30 ppm for acetylene at atmospheric \npressure. The acetylene calibration measurement is illustrated in fig 7.4 showing also the raw \nPS signals in the low concentration regime. In a recent work they have demonstrated \nquantitative acetylene detection in a series of ethylene\/air flames after calibration of the \nexperiment in C2H2\/N2 mixtures [250]. \nMost applications of coherent techniques provide only point measurements since the \nmeasurement volume is defined by the crossing point of several laser beams. In contrast to \nother four-wave mixing methods PS and DFWM can be extended to planar measurements \nallowing the instantaneous visualization of two-dimensional species distributions with \nreasonable spatial resolution [251]. This has been done by a number of groups for OH [252, \n253], C2 [229] and H [238]. Details will be discussed in section 9. \n \n 106\n \nFigure 7.4: IRPS signal intensity as a function of acetylene concentrations obtained at atmospheric pressure. \nThe dots represent the line-integrated signal intensity and the solid curve represents a quadratic dependence fit. \nThe inset shows the raw IRPS excitation scan spectra of the last three data points of the lowest acetylene \nconcentrations adopted in the measurement. (Figure reproduced with permission from reference [248].) \n \nPS thermometry has in most cases been performed utilizing the A-X(0,0) band of OH around \n308nm, e.g., by Nyholm et al. [254]. Since OH has a relatively long life-time it can be found \nin a wide region of most flames hence the OH temperature can be measured in many locations. \nThe usual method of deriving the temperature from a PS spectrum is to use a Boltzmann plot. \nA logarithmic plot of the relative intensities of different lines, which indicate the initial \nquantum state populations, are plotted against the energy of the initial state and the slope of \nthe resulting graph delivers the temperature assuming the populations are in Boltzmann \nequilibrium as previously shown for DFWM in fig. 3.5. A related technique employs the \nsignal intensities of only two lines determining temperature from the intensity ratio [255]. \nHowever, a careful selection of the pair of transitions is required in order to obtain reasonable \ntemperature sensitivity. Suvernev and co-workers [227] showed that it is also possible to \ndetermine the temperature by fitting theoretically calculated spectra to the experimental ones \nas it is commonly done in CARS thermometry. Kiefer et al. [255] demonstrated that it is not \neven necessary to perform theoretical calculations of PS spectra. They utilized the freely \navailable software tool LIFBASE [256] to simulate a library of DFWM spectra which were \nsubsequently compared to the experimental PS spectra of the OH A-X(1,0) band. This rather \n 107\npragmatic method yielded temperature data that were found to be in good agreement with \nresults from simultaneous laser-induced fluorescence measurements. In addition, the authors \nevaluated temperature information using the two-line method in order to get a temperature \nprofile in a laminar slot burner flame, see fig 7.5. A third approach derives the temperature \nfrom the spectral shape i.e. from the degree of Doppler broadening. The accuracy of this \nmethod is limited however since it is important that the laser linewidth is much narrower than \nthe Doppler width being measured. If the laser linewidth is not sufficiently narrow then it \nbecomes difficult, especially in the presence of noise on the signal, to determine accurately \nthe spectral lineshape which is a convolution of Doppler, collisional and natural lineshapes.  \n \n \nFigure 7.5: OH temperature profiles from the Wolfhard\u2013Parker burner determined by the two-line-method using \nPS signals: (a) 3-mm height and (b) 12-mm height above the burner exit. (Figure reproduced with permission \nfrom reference [255].) \n \nAll the thermometry based on PS mentioned above used spectra obtained by frequency-\nscanning narrowband lasers. Since this procedure takes some time the method is applicable \nonly in steady laminar flames. In order to achieve temporally resolved measurements the full \nspectral information must be gathered within a single laser shot. One possibility is to perform \nmultiplex spectroscopy in which many transitions are recorded simultaneously using a \nbroadband laser source. The resulting PS signal is dispersed and recorded using a high-\nresolution spectrometer. This technique was demonstrated by New et al. [257] for OH \n 108\nthermometry using a broadband modeless dye laser [113]. Another interesting approach was \ndeveloped by Nyholm et al. using a dual-wavelength laser [258]. In the beam of a broadband \ndye laser two separate birefringent crystals were placed achieving phase-matching for the \nsecond harmonic generation for two different wavelengths. The resulting ultraviolet radiation \nwas used to do two-dimensional temperature measurements by simultaneously probing the \nQ1(2) and Q1(9) lines of OH. In order to separate the individual signals from each other a \ndiffraction grating was employed projecting both wavelengths onto separate regions of a \ncamera chip. \n 109\n8 Other techniques \nThe previous chapters have described the four-wave mixing techniques which have been most \noften used for combustion diagnostics. These techniques have typically used a resonant \nenhancement of the nonlinear susceptibility by tuning the frequency of the incident laser \nfields to a molecular transition. A further FWM approach which is also suited for minor \nspecies detection in flames employs non-resonant pump beams in combination with a probe \nlaser that is tuned to a resonance in the species of interest (see fig. 8.1). This method is similar \nto the resonant two-colour FWM described in chapter 4, but in this case the pumping process \ninduces electrostrictive gratings instead of a population grating. As a consequence this \ntechnique suffers less from saturation effects than fully resonant methods. This approach has \nbeen demonstrated firstly by Lee et al. [259] who utilized a broadband probe laser for \nmultiplex C2 spectroscopy allowing single-shot thermometry in a premixed acetylene\/oxygen \nflame. The spectrum recorded using the C2 Swan band spectrum around 512 nm is shown in \nfig 8.2 together with the saturation curves of the line at 510.5 nm. The individual lines are well \nresolved which is advantageous for thermometry. Sun et al. [260] used the same technique \nwith a tunable narrowband laser to scan the spectrum of OH with high resolution. They \nstudied saturation and coherence effects using the second-harmonic radiation of a \nconventional multimode Nd:YAG laser as pump source. \n \n \nFigure 8.1: Energy level diagram of the non-resonant pump four-wave mixing technique. \n \n 110\n \nFigure 8.2: (a) NRP-FWM spectrum for the Swan band of the C2 molecules in an oxy\u2013acetylene flame. (b) \nQuadratic dependence of the signal on the pump pulse energy at 510.5 nm (dashed line: Logarithmic plot of \nslop 2.1). (c) The signal dependence on the probe pulse energy at 510.5 nm (dashed line: Logarithmic plot of \nslope 1.04). (Figure reproduced with permission from reference [259].) \n \nIn most cases four-wave mixing experiments are conducted using nanosecond pulsed lasers. \nNanosecond time resolution is usually sufficient for studying macroscopic aspects of \ncombusting flows. Molecular behaviour can also be investigated in the frequency domain \nwhen for instance line broadening delivers information about collisions. The molecular \ndynamics involved in collision broadening however occur on picosecond timescales or shorter.  \nTherefore in order to either study molecular relaxation or dephasing in the time domain or to \navoid influences from collisional processes ultra-short laser pulses in the pico- or femto-\nsecond range are required. In a typical time-resolved four-wave mixing experiment the \nmolecules are pumped into a certain state and its evolution is probed as a function of time \ndelay. Such \u201cpump-probe experiments\u201d are capable of resolving the temporal evolution of the \ncoherences induced by the pump fields. This principle is illustrated in Fig. 8.3 taking the \nCARS process as an example. The simultaneous pump and Stokes laser pulses \u03c91 respectively \n\u03c92 excite the Raman coherence as a first step (\u03c4 = 0). As a function of the time-delay \u0394\u03c4 \nbetween the pump process and probe laser pulse the temporal evolution of the Raman \ncoherence can be observed. One particular advantage of delaying the probe pulse in four-\n 111\nwave mixing is that the non-resonant background which complicates the interpretation of \nCARS signals is suppressed. The main reason for this is that the lifetime of the \u201cvirtual\u201d states \ninvolved in non-resonant FWM decay on a timescale of 1\/\u0394\u03c9, where \u0394\u03c9 is the detuning of the \npump laser from the nearest resonance. This is a consequence of Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty \nprinciple. Therefore non-resonant signals are observed only when all input beam are \ncoincident. The resonant signal however is detectable within the lifetime of the resonantly \nexcited coherence which typically exceeds the duration of ultra-short pulses.  \nAnother consequence of the Uncertainty Principle is that as pulse durations are decreased the \nspectral bandwidth increases. As a result the spectral width required to produce femtosecond \npulses is much broader than the linewidth of atomic or molecular transitions leading to a loss \nof spectral resolution and the ability to selectively excite particular quantum states. It is \npossible however to use pulses of 10 \u2013 100 picosecond duration which have a sufficiently \nnarrow bandwidth to allow spectral plus time resolution of vibrational and even pure \nrotational CARS [166, 261]. Very recently, a hybrid approach employed for dual-broadband \nvibrational CARS utilized femtosecond pulses for the pump and Stokes beams and a \npicosecond probe beam [262]. This method takes advantage of the broad bandwidth of the fs \npulses for multiplex spectroscopy, and at the same time it overcomes the problem of mode \nfluctuations that are typically associated with conventional broadband sources such as dye \nlasers. As mentioned above, the picosecond probe pulse is relatively narrow to allow signal \ndetection in the frequency domain. Alternatively experiments in the growing field of coherent \ncontrol have shown that using femtosecond pulses appropriately shaped in spectral intensity \nand phase can be used to selectively excite particular rotation-vibration modes in molecules \n[263, 264]. \n \n 112\n \nFigure 8.3: Energy level diagram of time-resolved CARS. \n \nNitrogen CARS thermometry is nowadays often realized using pico- or femtosecond lasers to \ntake advantage of the non-resonant background suppression. Details can be found in the \nrecent reviews by Gord et al. [265] and Roy et al. [266]. An interesting development that \nexploits the coherence excited by ultra-short pulses is the ability to isolate individual Raman \nmodes by temporal\/spectral shaping of the laser pulses. Motzkus and others have shown that \nsuch quantum coherence control may be used to identify particular species by means of their \nRaman signature using femtosecond CARS for the study of reaction dynamics [267]. Of \nparticular interest to combustion diagnostics is the possibility of using the temperature effects \non the coherent dynamics for thermometry [268]. Coherent states induced by femtosecond \npulses in Raman induced polarization spectroscopy may lead to transient alignments of \nmolecules that can be probed by time-delayed pulses. These alignments are observed as \nrecurrences having a time period determined by the moments of inertia of the rotating \nmolecules and are very sensitive to temperature. \nThe application of short-pulse lasers to resonant four-wave mixing has taken various forms. \nDreizler et al. [269] studied orientational relaxation of OH radicals in an atmospheric pressure \nflame using picosecond polarization spectroscopy in the A-X (0,0) band. Their measurements \nallowed the simultaneous determination of different line broadening parameters which are \nrequired for accurate modelling of the molecular physics. Suvernev et al. [270] conducted \npicosecond time-resolved DFWM and PS experiments of OH in premixed methane\/air and \nhydrogen\/oxygen flames in order to study the dependence of the signal intensities on the \npolarization configurations of the incident laser beams. A comparison of the experimental \n 113\nresults with theoretically calculated data showed good agreement. The investigation of \ncollisional effects and a theoretical treatment of picosecond polarization spectroscopy was \nreported by Lucht et al. [271, 272]. They showed that, when the laser pulse duration is \nsignificantly shorter than collisional time-scales, the PS signal is in principle relatively \nunaffected by collisions in the saturated regime in particular. OH radicals were also studied \nusing a two-colour double-resonance FWM approach using picosecond pulses by Chen and \nSettersten [273]. After pumping rovibrational transitions in the mid-infrared spectral range the \nmolecules were probed through electronic transitions in the ultraviolet spectrum. Measuring \nthe temporal decay of laser-induced population, alignment and orientation allowed a detailed \ninvestigation of collisional effects on the electronic ground state. \n \n \nFigure 8.4: TC-6WM and TC-LIF signals as a function of the delay between pump and probe pulses. Single-\nexponential fits to the data in the tails of the decay are shown as solid lines. (Figure reproduced with permission \nfrom reference [237].) \n \nA two-colour approach for PS and two-dimensional applications has already been mentioned \nfor detecting atomic hydrogen [236, 238]. In this method two-photon excitation of hydrogen \natoms from the ground state to the first excited state was followed by the four-wave mixing \nprocess of PS to access different higher excited states. As six photons are involved this \n 114\nmethod can also be considered as six-wave mixing. Kulatilaka et al. [237] employed \npicosecond lasers to perform time-resolved 6WM and fluorescence measurements of H atoms \nfor studying collisional effects. Figure 8.4 shows the recorded signals as a function of pump-\nprobe delay. A delay of 0 ps means a temporal overlap of the pump and probe pulses as \ndescribed above for CARS. The measured LIF decay time yields the upper state population \nlifetime while the nonlinear PS technique delivers information about the coherence life time. \n 115\n9 Practical considerations, applications and fields under development \nIn the previous sections the underlying physics of resonant four-wave mixing and the most \nimportant techniques based on these processes have been presented. Applications of these \nmethods have been described that focus mostly on molecular physics and the measurement of \ncombustion relevant parameters of temperature and species concentration at a single point in \neither laminar laboratory flames or static gas cells. In this section extension of these \ntechniques to multiple dimensions and multiple species measurements is outlined together \nwith a discussion of applications in practical combustors such as engines. \n9.1 Multidimensional applications \nA typical four-wave mixing interaction involves the intersection of three laser beams at a \npoint and at the appropriate angles to satisfy phase matching conditions. The \u201cintersection \npoint\u201d is more exactly a finite volume which may be considered as a cylinder that can be \ndetermined precisely by focal-plane imaging techniques [274] in combination with a \ncomputational data analysis [275]. Such point-wise measurements however limit the \napplications to either stationary systems such as laminar flames and gas cells or to the \ndetermination of local statistics in turbulent environments. When practical combustion \nsystems are investigated the measurement of spatially and temporally correlated data is \nusually required. \nInitial attempts to extend CARS measurements to 1-dimension i.e. along a line met with \nlimited success. The measurement line was defined by the intersection of co-planar pumps \none of which was formed into a sheet. The Stokes beam then intersected this line at a small \nangle to the plane of the pumps resulting in a weak sheet-like signal beam emitted out of the \nplane [276]. \nMore typically four-wave mixing measurements along a one-dimensional line require the \nthree exciting laser beams to be formed into parallel light sheets and overlapped by a \n 116\ncylindrical lens as illustrated in fig. 9.1. In the figure the signal is generated along the x-axis \nand imaged onto a camera chip or the entrance slit of a spectrograph. Jonuscheit et al. [277] \ndemonstrated this approach for nitrogen thermometry using vibrational CARS. In their \nexperiments however the spatial resolution was limited since imaging optics were not \nemployed to direct the signal onto the spectrograph entrance slit. In general even when phase \nmatching imposes a directional property on the signal beam imaging optics are required to \nform a spatially resolved image as described by Smith and Ewart [105].  \n \n \nFigure 9.1: Four-wave mixing scheme for one-dimensional applications along the x-axis by overlapping laser \nsheets through a cylindrical lens, CL. \n \n1-D measurements of temperature and pressure along a line in NO2\/N2 mixtures over a range \nof pressures in a cell were achieved by Stevens and Ewart using time-resolved laser-induced \nthermal gratings [278]. The signal was produced using ns-duration pump pulses from a \nfrequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser and a 1\u00b5s probe pulse from a flashlamp-pumped dye laser. \nA line like interaction region was achieved by intersecting two sheet-like pump beams in the \nmanner shown in figure 9.1. The probe light scattered off this line was recorded on a streak \ncamera which provided a space-resolved measurement of the temporal oscillations of the \nsignal from each point on the line as shown in figure 9.2. Temperatures and pressures were \nobtained with precisions of the order of 0.5% and 20% respectively with time resolution of \n~1\u00b5s and spatial resolution of 150\u00b5m along the line. The reduced precision in the pressure \nmeasurement arose in this case from the limited time range that could be measured using the \n 117\navailable streak camera and so the full exponential decay of the signals could not be recorded \non a single shot. \n \n \nFigure 9.2: Spatially resolved LIGS signal from a line in a NO2\/N2 mixture recorded on a streak camera with a \ntime-base of 100 ns. The image is a composite of five single-shot LIGS signals obtained from five separate \nimages at increasing delay. (Figure reproduced with permission from reference [278].) \n \nThe realisation of two-dimensional four-wave mixing is in principle more complicated as \ninstantaneous phase-matching is required in an entire plane. This can be a problem when \nmulti-colour techniques like CARS are used since up to three lasers must interact with the \nmolecules of interest. For degenerate methods such as PS and DFWM this is not the case as \nmultiple photons for the four-wave mixing process can be taken from one laser beam. Figure \n9.3 illustrates a possibility for 2D experiments using PS and DFWM. The pump beam is \nformed to a thin laser sheet while the probe beam is a collimated beam extended in diameter. \nThe measurement plane is defined by the pump sheet and the area by the cross-section of the \nprobe beam. In the case of DFWM the pump photons may be provided by counter-\npropagating laser sheets. \n \n 118\n \nFigure 9.3: Scheme for orthogonal planar PS and DFWM. The measurement plane is indicated. \n \nTwo-dimensional imaging using DFWM was performed for the first time by Ewart et al. \n[103]. The principle was demonstrated by seeding NaCl to a laminar slot burner flame in \norder to image the resulting Na atom distribution. Rakestraw et al. [104] extended this \ntechnique to the natural flame species OH. Mann et al. [89] detected NO2 in both flames and \nnon-reacting environments in cold flows and inside a static glass cell. Under flame conditions \nthey reported detection of NO2 at concentrations as low as 7000 ppm with a spatial resolution \nof 150 \u00b5m in a single-shot measurement. As mentioned above the imaging process was \ndiscussed by Ewart et al. [105] to account for diffraction effects and spatial resolution. \nImaging of OH and NO in flows was reported together with an image referencing method to \ncompensate for structure on the images arising from beam and laser sheet inhomogeneities. \nSimilar to the DFWM approach Hemmerling and Stampanoni-Panariello employed 2D \nelectrostrictive LIGS to image a helium flow in ambient air as well as a sooting flame [279]. \nIn 1993 imaging using PS was demonstrated for the first time by Nyholm et al. [252] who \nrecorded 2D images of flame OH. L\u00f6fstedt and Ald\u00e9n [230] also demonstrated 2D detection \nof OH and NO. In both works the pump laser sheet and the probe beam were overlapped at \nrelatively small angles which leads to foreshortening of the image and limited spatial \nresolution. The optimal spatial resolution is obtained when pump and probe laser intercept \northogonally as described by Reppel [251]. Further planar PS studies were conducted for OH \n[253] and C2 [229] by Walewski et al. More recently Linvin et al. [238] demonstrated imaging \n 119\nof ground-state hydrogen atoms by PS after two-photon pumping into the 2s state. The single-\nshot H distribution obtained by the latter method in a hydrogen\/oxygen welding torch flame is \nillustrated in Fig 9.4. \n \n \nFigure 9.4: Single-shot image of ground-state hydrogen atoms recorded in a hydrogen\/oxygen welding torch \nflame using two-photon planar polarization spectroscopy. (Figure reproduced with permission from reference \n[238].) \n \nExtension of 2D imaging of concentration distributions to two-dimensional flame \nthermometry was demonstrated by Ewart and Kaczmarek [280]. 2D DFWM images of OH in \na laminar premixed methane\/air flame were recorded using two different rotational transitions. \nThe intensity of the images at each position reflects the Boltzmann distribution of population \nfrom which the temperature was derived. Since the laser had to be tuned between recording \nthe two images, single-shot measurement was not possible. To overcome this limitation \nNyholm et al. [258] employed a dual-wavelength laser source where each of the wavelengths \nwas tuned to a different rotational line of OH. The two UV wavelengths were generated by \nsecond harmonic generation in two separate crystals each adjusted to frequency double a \ndifferent spectral component of the beam from a Nd:YAG pumped dye laser. The output thus \nconsisted of a single beam containing two separately tunable frequency components. With this \n 120\nlaser 2D DFWM and 2D PS signals were generated at each of the two wavelengths. Since the \nsignals at the two wavelengths are also collinear a grating was employed to spatially separate \nthe images. Both images were then recorded on a single CCD chip allowing single-shot \ntemperature measurements. \n9.2 Multi-species and multiplex measurements \nIn most resonant four-wave mixing experiments spectra are recorded by scanning a \nnarrowband laser over a certain spectral range. In many practical situations, however, it is \ndesirable to record the entire spectrum in a single laser pulse in order to achieve temporal \nresolution. This requires a laser source with a bandwidth covering the relevant spectral region \nand allows single-shot thermometry since multiple lines of a single species are recorded \nsimultaneously. Alternatively such broadband spectroscopy allows detection of multiple \nspecies when their transitions are in close spectral vicinity. Dispersion of the signal is required \nto measure the separate spectral components and this is usually provided by a spectrograph or \ninterferometer. The most common four-wave mixing technique where at least one broadband \nlaser is used for realizing multiplex measurements is CARS for single-shot nitrogen \nthermometry [266]. So far there have been relatively few studies using multiplex methods \nwith other four-wave mixing processes.  \nThe use of broadband lasers violates one of the basic assumptions of the theoretical models of \nfour-wave mixing viz. the interacting beams are considered monochromatic. Theoretical \ntreatments of the effects of finite bandwidth on the signal intensity of resonant FWM were \ndeveloped using a density matrix formalism assuming that the bandwidth exceeded all other \nrelaxation rates in the interaction [71, 72]. This approach was extended to calculate the \nspectral lineshape of the resonant FWM signal by Smith and Ewart [74]. Measurements of the \nsignal linewidth obtained from flame OH showed good agreement with the theory. In a \nfollow-up study Walker et al. [73] measured the dependence of the spectral lineshape on \n 121\npressure by recording signals from nitric oxide in nitrogen buffer gas. The variation of the \nsignal generated by broadband lasers with the length of the interaction region was modelled \ntheoretically by Bratfalean and Ewart [281, 282].  \nAnother effect of finite bandwidths in FWM experiments is the reduction in the coherence \nlength of the radiation i.e. the distance over which the electromagnetic waves retain a \nconsistent phase. Since the magnitude of the FWM signal depends on the atomic or molecular \ncoherence induced over a finite spatial extent the signal intensity will be affected by the \ntemporal correlation of the incident waves. In practice this means that optimum signal \ngeneration is found when all three input beams are temporally coincident. The optical paths \nfor each beam to the interaction volume therefore need to be controlled accurately. An \nextreme example of this problem is represented by the work of Kozlov et al. [205] who \nemployed two beams from a broadband (~400 cm-1) dye laser to generate thermal laser-\ninduced gratings through two-photon excitation of pure rotational Raman transitions. They \nreported that the difference between the path lengths for the two beams had to be less than 33 \n\u00b5m, which was approximately the coherence length.  \nThe first multiplex DFWM experiments were carried out by Ewart and Snowdon [110] using \nthe broadband output of a Nd:YAG-pumped modeless dye laser. The laser pulse having a \nbandwidth of ~2 nm FWHM centred on 590 nm was used to record single-shot spectra \nshowing the two D-lines (separated by ~0.6 nm) of atomic sodium that had been seeded into a \nflame. Kaminski et al. [112] employed a similar laser source to generate multiplex DFWM \nspectra of C2 radicals for single-shot thermometry in an acetylene\/oxygen flame stabilized on \na welding torch. The multiplex FWM signal was directed to the slit of a spectrograph and the \nspectrum recorded on a CCD camera. A small fraction of the dye laser beam was delivered \ndirectly to the spectrograph slit at a lower position to record the spectral excitation profile for \nonline referencing. A typical multiplex DFWM spectrum of the C2 Swan bands is displayed in \nfigure 9.5(a) together with the simultaneously recorded spectral profile of the incident beam. \n 122\nThis figure also shows a theoretically calculated spectrum fitted to the experimental data \nusing temperature as the fitting parameter. The temperatures derived from such data had a \nsingle-shot precision of ~10% as indicated by the histogram in figure 9.5(b). The precision of \nmeasurement is improved by averaging over several laser shots. Optical dephasing effects that \noccur when broadband excitation allows coupled transitions to be pumped simultaneously \nwere studied theoretically and experimentally by Lloyd and Ewart [116]. This work identified \nthe conditions where such effects affect the accuracy of the temperature derived from \nmultiplex FWM. Multiplex FWM spectroscopy of OH for flame thermometry has also been \nreported by Lloyd et al. [76]. Latzel et al. [209] recorded broadband DFWM spectra in \nmethane\/air flames at elevated pressure (atmospheric to 30 bar) concluding that thermometry \nis possible at pressures as high as 6 bar. Beyond this pressure the experimental DFWM \nsignals did not provide sufficient intensity levels.  \n \na b  \nFigure 9.5: (a) Multiplex DFWM spectrum of C2 recorded from an oxy-acetylene welding torch. The solid line \nshows a least-square best fit calculated spectrum to the experimental spectrum (dashed line). The stick spectra \nin the upper part of the diagram indicate the spectral assignments. The spectrum includes more than 60 lines in \nthe R and P branches of the d3\u03a0g \u2013a3\u03a0u (0,0) band. The upper curve peaking at 514.8 nm is the simultaneously \nrecorded laser intensity spectrum. (b)Typical histogram of temperatures obtained from 100 single-shot \nmultiplex DFWM spectra. The solid line indicates the Gaussian distribution of this data giving a mean \ntemperature of 2993 K with a standard deviation of 325 K. (Figure reproduced with permission from reference \n[112].) \n \n 123\nNew et al. [257] performed OH polarization spectroscopy measurements using both a \nbroadband laser and a tunable narrowband laser for comparison. They report strong \ninterference from absorption effects leading to systematic errors in the temperature \ndetermination. After correcting for these effects a precision of 4% in the single-shot multiplex \ndata could be achieved. \nMulti-species measurements have been demonstrated by L\u00f6fstedt and Ald\u00e9n [230] using \nsimultaneous polarization spectroscopy of OH and NO in a hydrogen\/N2O flame. They \nutilized a Nd:YAG pumped dye laser which was tuned to 570 nm. The beam was frequency-\ndoubled to provide 285 nm radiation for OH detection in the A-X(1,0) band. Frequency \nmixing the 285 nm beam with the residual fundamental Nd:YAG output at 1064 nm delivered \nadditional radiation at 225 nm suited for NO detection. Both wavelengths were combined in a \nsingle laser beam and scanning this dual-wavelength laser facilitated simultaneous detection \nof OH and NO at the spectral coincidences of the OH Q1(11.5) \/ NO Q2(35.5) lines and the \nOH P1(9.5) \/ NO R2(20.5) lines. \n9.3 Applications to technical systems \nCombustion in technical systems often presents complex challenges for diagnostics. Flames \nmay be unsteady or highly turbulent and are often confined within chambers with limited \noptical access. Important examples are turbine combustors, industrial furnaces and internal \ncombustion (IC) engines. As described in section 2 conventional optical techniques either are \nline-of-sight methods or require large numerical apertures for signal collection. For example \napplication of Raman spectroscopy or laser-induced fluorescence to a technical combustion \nsystem requires large access windows in order to obtain sufficient signal levels. Large areas of \nglass however may significantly alter the important thermodynamic properties of the device, \ne.g. heat transfer characteristics. In contrast, four-wave mixing techniques require only small \noptical access and for this reason are well suited for measurements in such environments. \n 124\nOwing to the complications and poor optical access the internal operations of technical \ncombustion systems have proved difficult to study. Measurements of parameters involving \nminor species therefore have not had high priority in such studies and so resonant four-wave \nmixing studies in technical combustion are rare in the literature. In contrast, temperature is a \nkey parameter in combustion and its determination is certainly desirable in technical systems. \nConventional N2 CARS has been the most widely used technique in such systems and the \nbasics of these applications have been extensively reviewed [16, 283]. \n \nInternal combustion engines are of utmost importance in modern society, particularly for \nindividual transport. They provide a typical example of a highly complex system involving a \nrepetitive combustion process in a confined and temporally varying volume. In the past few \ndecades there has been increasing application of non-intrusive methods for in-cylinder, cycle-\nresolved measurements [284]. Four-wave mixing techniques, particularly CARS, have proven \nto be of value. More recently other resonant four-wave mixing processes have begun to find \napplications in engine diagnostics as supplementary or complementary techniques to CARS. \nModern engine designs employing direct injection of fuel depend critically on the mixture \nformation process. The gaseous or liquid fuel must be rapidly intermixed with air to obtain an \nignitable mixture typically within a few milliseconds. The specific volume of air mixed may \nbe affected by cooling induced by evaporation of the injected liquid fuel. Beyrau et al. [137, \n285] used pure-rotational CARS thermometry of nitrogen to measure the temporally resolved \nlocal cooling when a liquid iso-octane spray evaporated in a constant volume chamber. By \nadditionally applying Raman spectroscopy Weikl et al. [286] simultaneously determined \nmixture composition and gas temperature in gaseous and liquid propane injection systems. In \nthe same propane gas injection process Seeger et al. [212, 213] used laser-induced gratings to \nmeasure the local equivalence ratio as a function of time after the start of injection. At high \nfuel concentration the grating oscillation period was utilized while at low propane \n 125\nconcentration the ratio between electrostrictive and thermal gratings yielded results with good \naccuracy. A similar approach has previously been reported by Schlamp and Sobota who \nmeasured iodine concentration in nitrogen [287]. \nAlthough vibrational CARS is the most commonly used form of CARS, rotational CARS \noffers some advantages particularly at lower temperature regimes. Prior to combustion the in-\ncylinder temperature is in the range where the \u201chot bands\u201d of N2 are not sufficiently \nprominent to provide precise measurements. In this regime rotational CARS, in spite of the \ndifficulties with scattered light from the spectrally adjacent pump light provides improved \ntemperature sensitivity. Pure rotational CARS has been used by Bengtsson and co-workers \n[288] to measure the temperature and relative oxygen\/nitrogen concentrations during the \ncompression stroke. They demonstrated the first rotational CARS experiments in a natural gas \nfired spark-ignited IC engine. In their follow-up work they studied also the influences of \nmixture composition and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on the knock behaviour [289]. A \nsummary of these activities has been given by Brackmann et al. [290]. Weikl et al. [18] \nobtained simultaneous information about local temperature and EGR rate from the \ncompression stroke in a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine. \nAt high temperatures vibrational CARS is preferred owing to its relative freedom from \nscattering interference and therefore has been used to study the engine combustion process. \nThe first thermometry applications have been demonstrated some 30 years ago by Stenhouse \n[291] and Klick [292]. More recently Ewart et al. [293] studied the influence of the fuel on the \nburnt gas temperature and compared their experimental results with predictions from a multi-\nzone computer simulation.  \nAs mentioned above, resonant FWM processes have so far found fewer applications in \ntechnical combustors. The reason seems to have been the perception that aligning the input \npump and probe beams is difficult and the supposed effects of turbulence on the induced \ngrating. In practice however the alignment of the three beams for a DFWM experiment is no \n 126\nmore difficult than for CARS. In addition, as explained above, CARS involves a laser induced \ngrating in exactly the same way as DFWM and so the latter will be no more or less sensitive \nto turbulence than CARS which has been shown to work in many applications. The first use \nof DFWM to detect a minor species in a firing IC engine was reported by Grant et al. [294]. \nStable and reliable beam alignment in the forward phase matching geometry, and freedom \nfrom scattered light interference, was achieved by using a simple beam splitter arrangement \nconsisting of parallel sided quartz blocks and a simple two-lens focussing system. Spectra of \ncombustion generated NO were obtained with excellent signal-to-noise ratio. (See figure \n9.6(a).) The application of DFWM in IC engines has recently been extended to quantitative \nmeasurements of NO concentrations in a firing methane-fuelled engine by Stevens et al. who \nrecorded the DFWM signal intensity on a temperature-insensitive line [295]. A comparison of \nthe quantitative results with reference data from absorption measurements and a conventional \nexhaust analyzer showed good agreement as depicted in Figure 9.6(b). As the formation of \nNOx is strongly dependent on the combustion temperature the results of NO concentration as \na function of the mixture stoichiometry reveal a similar behaviour as expected for the \nadiabatic flame temperature [296]. \n \na b  \nFigure 9.6: (a) DFWM spectrum of NO in a firing methane-fuelled engine. The noise level is indicated by the \nregion to the right of the arrow. (Figure reproduced with permission from reference [294].) (b) NO \nconcentrations measured using DFWM on a temperature insensitive line. The data agrees with measurements on \nNO measured by absorption and on NOx measured by an exhaust gas analyser. (Figure reproduced with \npermission from reference [295].) \n 127\n \nApart from IC engines four-wave mixing measurements have been demonstrated in several \nother technical systems. Hemmerling et al. [297] utilized electrostrictive laser-induced \ngratings to determine flow velocity close to the exit of a rocket nozzle. Lucas et al. employed \npolarization spectroscopy for studying Na atoms in a welding plasma [298]. B\u00e9du\u00e9 et al. [299] \nperformed temperature and oxygen concentration measurements with vibrational CARS in a \nmodel turbomachine combustor. The same method was used by Eckbreth et al. [300] in jet \nengine exhaust gases for N2 thermometry and detection of oxygen, water and carbon \nmonoxide. Kampmann et al. [301] applied pointwise vibrational CARS and planar laser \nRayleigh scattering simultaneously in a highly turbulent swirl flame. While the Rayleigh \nmeasurement was used to obtain a relative temperature distribution, the CARS data could be \nused to determine the absolute temperature in one point of the plane hence potentially \nproviding a calibration of the planar technique. Thermometry in laminar high-pressure \ncombustion environments has been demonstrated, e.g., by Vestin et al. [302] using pure \nrotational CARS and Brown and Roberts [215] using laser-induced gratings. Industrial coal \nand oil furnaces have been investigated with CARS by Ald\u00e9n and Wallin [303] and by \nFerrario et al. [304]. Besides large scale systems like gas turbines, furnaces and jet engines \ntechnical combustion is often realized in compact devices. In such environments it is \nimportant to make measurements close to surfaces as heat transfer may influence the \ncombustion process. Br\u00fcbach et al. [305] combined thermographic phosphors and vibrational \nnitrogen CARS to study the normal temperature gradients close to surfaces where gas jets and \nflames impinged. Braeuer et al. [306] performed temperature and oxygen concentration \nmeasurements employing dual-pump CARS in an automotive auxiliary heating combustor \noperated with dodecane and diesel fuels. Kiefer et al. [19] determined temperature and \nhydrogen concentration in the ceramic foam matrix of a porous burner. In their experiments a \nsingle hole with 1.5 mm diameter provided sufficient optical access for the three CARS laser \n 128\nbeams to enter the combustion zone. Their results revealed the strong heat recuperation \neffects on the gas phase temperature profile inside the porous material. \n 129\n10 Summary, conclusion and outlook \nIn this article we have reviewed the development and use of resonant four-wave mixing \ntechniques for the detection and measurement of minor combustion species. A brief overview \nof conventional methods for trace species detection has been given together with a discussion \nof their limitations and the possibility of addressing these by nonlinear methods. The \nfundamentals of nonlinear optical processes, in particular four-wave mixing, have been \nintroduced to show how their advantageous properties arise. These properties such as coherent \n(laser-like) signal and high sensitivity were shown to have useful implications for \nexperimental combustion diagnostics. The commonly employed techniques of degenerate \nfour-wave mixing (DFWM), coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), laser-induced \nthermal grating spectroscopy (LITGS) and polarization spectroscopy (PS) have been reviewed \nin detail. Other related methods have been outlined together with a brief review of practical \nconsiderations and fields currently under development. \nThe standing of combustion diagnostics based on four-wave mixing techniques has \nsignificantly changed over the past decades. This is shown by considering the number of \nrelated publications per annum. In the late 1970s the first proof-of-principle studies were \npublished along with the first attempts to describe the complicated physics behind resonant \nFWM in gases. During the 80s the annual amount of published work remained almost \nconstant at a relatively low level. In the 1990s, however, resonant FWM methods become \nbroadly accepted diagnostic tools resulting in a steep increase in the number of publications \nforming a plateau over the entire decade. In this period nonlinear techniques have been \npushed forward in terms of experimental arrangements as well as theoretical understanding. \nThe interest dropped rather abruptly in the beginning of the current decade, but has \nexperienced a renaissance during the past five years. This revival of resonant four-wave \nmixing techniques in combustion can be correlated with the recent developments in \n 130\nexperimental equipment and computational power. Novel laser systems and detectors have \nopened the field to new spectral regions and time scales. \nPowerful pulsed near- and mid-infrared lasers facilitate four-wave mixing of so-called \u201cdark \nspecies\u201d. These are species that do not absorb by electronic transitions in the ultraviolet and \nvisible spectral region or that do not fluoresce and so are not amenable to the usual absorption \nor fluorescence detection methods. In the context of combustion diagnostics a large number of \ncombustion-relevant hydrocarbons as well as water and carbon dioxide fall into this category. \nThese species previously have been mainly detected using sampling methods like molecular \nbeam mass spectrometry which involves low pressure detection. FWM in the IR provides the \npossibility of probing these species in situ and non-intrusively with high temporal and spatial \nresolution. One of the severe problems in using DFWM in the infrared is setting up and \nmaintaining alignment of three input beams and directing the signal beam to the detector. This \nproblem has been solved using a robust beam splitter arrangement developed for DFWM in \nfiring engines using UV lasers [294]. This simple and stable system has recently been \nsuccessfully applied in the mid-infrared demonstrating the potential for in situ sensing of \nimportant trace molecular species [95]. Furthermore these optical detection schemes are not \nlimited to low-pressure environments. This is a potentially important field for future \ndevelopments and may contribute significantly to the understanding of hydrocarbon \ndecomposition and the formation of soot precursors and particles. \nReliable and easy-to-use ultra-short pulse lasers have become commercially available \nallowing spectroscopy in the time-domain. Amongst other advantages the use of such ultra-\nshort pulses allows the effects of collisions to be avoided. In addition, by suitable choices of \ntime-delays interferences from non-resonant FWM can be suppressed. Furthermore the short \npulses provide the high intensity needed for the nonlinear interaction whilst having low \nenergy and so this minimizes interference from elastically scattered light and reduces the risk \nof damaging optics. The signals are sometimes strong enough to be observed by the naked eye \n 131\nwhich means that intensified detectors with their limitations are no longer required. Recent \nprogress in quantitative measurements and single-shot applications using these techniques has \nsparked new interest within the combustion diagnostics community and is expected to lead to \na continuing effort to further development. Another feature of ultra-short pulse lasers is their \nusually high repetition rate in the order of kHz or even MHz. As a consequence transient \nphenomena including flame ignition and extinction as well as knocking in engines can be \nstudied in real-time if single-shot measurements are feasible. \nLast, but not least, the applicability of FWM in technically relevant combustion systems \nexploiting the coherent, laser-like signal properties will be another driving force in the future. \nFWM techniques have finally disproved the prejudice that they are inherently complicated \nand of limited use. By contrast, it can be expected that they become common tools for \nmeasurements of species concentration, temperature and other combustion parameters in \nenvironments and situations that are beyond the limits of other more conventional methods. \n \nAcknowledgement \nThe authors are grateful to our colleagues with whom we have worked and collaborated over \nthe years and to members of the combustion diagnostics community with whom we have \ninteracted in fruitful and enjoyable discussions.
