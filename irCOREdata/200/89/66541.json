Introduction\n[2] Geophysical investigations of submarine landforms\nand sediments are fundamental to the accurate reconstruc-\ntion of the dimensions and dynamics of Quaternary ice\nsheets. This is illustrated by the case of the Antarctic Ice\nSheet during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) when the\nice sheet expanded onto the continental shelf and, in\nsome localities, reached the shelf edge [Pudsey et al.,\n1994; Larter and Vanneste, 1995; O\u00b4 Cofaigh et al., 2002,\n2005; Lowe and Anderson, 2002; Anderson et al., 2002;\nDowdeswell et al., 2004; Evans et al., 2005]. The landforms\nand sediment recording this ice sheet advance across the\ncontinental shelf are now exposed at the seafloor following\nice sheet retreat and are only accessible using marine\ngeophysical and geological techniques.\n[3] Current interest in the stability of the marine-\nbased West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) centers on the\npossibility of its total or partial collapse, and the\ncorresponding effect of such a collapse on eustatic sea\nlevel [Bindschadler, 1998]. Central to this question is the\nconfiguration and extent of WAIS at the LGM, as well as\nthe style and rate of its subsequent retreat. These are\nfundamental to any attempts to model the contribution of\nWAIS to sea level rise since the LGM. Estimates of the\nmagnitude of such a contribution are variable and depend\nupon the ice sheet reconstruction used in the model,\nwhich, in turn, depends on accurate geological inputs\n[cf. Nakada and Lambeck, 1998; Huybrechts, 1990, 2002;\nTushingham and Peltier, 1991; Nakada et al., 2000].\nAlthough the configuration and dynamics of the WAIS\nthrough the last glacial-deglacial cycle are reasonably\nwell known for several areas around Antarctica such as\nthe Ross Sea [Shipp et al., 1999; Domack et al., 1999;\nLicht et al., 1999; Wellner et al., 2001] and the Antarctic\nPeninsula margin [Pope and Anderson, 1992; Pudsey et\nal., 1994; Larter and Vanneste, 1995; Canals et al., 2000;\nO\u00b4 Cofaigh et al., 2005; Evans et al., 2005], there still\nremain large gaps in key areas. One such area is the\ncontinental margin of the Bellingshausen Sea (Figure 1).\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 110, B11103, doi:10.1029\/2005JB003619, 2005\n1Department of Geography, University of Durham, Durham, UK.\n2British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\n3Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge,\nUK.\nCopyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/05\/2005JB003619$09.00\nB11103 1 of 13\n[4] Until recently there have been only limited data\navailable from the continental shelf and slope of the\nsouthern Bellingshausen Sea, and ice sheet extent at the\nLGM in this region was largely unknown [Bentley and\nAnderson, 1998; Bentley, 1999]. More recently, however,\nmarine geological and geophysical investigations from\nEltanin Bay on the inner continental shelf, identified a large\nbathymetric trough as well as a variety of streamlined\nsubglacial bed forms including erosional grooves, drumlins\nand megascale glacial lineations (MSGL) [Wellner et al.,\n2001]. The new data we present in this paper show that the\ntrough continues to the shelf edge, and it is informally\nnamed here as \u2018\u2018Belgica Trough\u2019\u2019. Wellner et al. [2001]\ninferred that the former grounding line of the WAIS during\nthe LGM was on the midshelf, beyond their area of data\ncoverage. Seismic profiles had already revealed that the\nouter continental shelf and upper slope at the mouth of the\ntrough in this region comprise a series of prograded\nsequences that record a seaward migration of the shelf edge\nby more than 35 km [Cunningham et al., 1994; Nitsche et\nal., 1997, 2000]. Collectively, these observations suggested\nthat a grounded WAIS advanced into Eltanin Bay and to the\nshelf edge in this region at some time in the past. However,\nthe timing (LGM or pre-LGM?) of this advance was\nunknown and direct glacial geomorphological evidence\nfor a grounded ice sheet on the outer shelf has not been\nobserved to date.\n[5] In this paper we address three questions. (1) What was\nthe extent and configuration of grounded ice in the southern\nBellingshausen Sea at the LGM; in particular, did an\nexpanded WAIS reach the edge of the continental shelf?\n(2) What is the landform\/sediment record of ice sheet\nadvance and retreat across the shelf and what does this\nrecord tell us about conditions at the former ice sheet bed?\n(3) What was the style of ice sheet retreat during deglaci-\nation; was retreat rapid or staggered? These questions are\nimportant because depending on the size of the paleoice\nsheet drainage basin, Belgica Trough could have been one\nof the largest pathways for outflow from the WAIS at the\nLGM [Larter et al., 2004]. However, an absence of multi-\nbeam swath bathymetric data from the outer continental\nshelf, as well as from the Ronne Entrance and an associated\npaucity of acoustic subbottom profiler data, has prevented\nsuch a regional reconstruction of paleoice sheet extent and\nconfiguration. New geophysical data presented in this paper\nallow such a reconstruction to be made for the continental\nmargin of the Bellingshausen Sea for the first time.\n2. Data Acquisition and Methods\n[6] Geophysical and geological data were acquired on the\ncontinental shelf and slope of the Bellingshausen Sea during\ncruise JR104 of RRS James Clark Ross in January\u2013February\n2004. Geophysical data were collected using a hull-mounted\nKongsberg-Simrad EM120 multibeam swath bathymetry\nsystem and a TOPAS subbottom profiler. The EM120 system\nemits 191 beams, each with dimensions of 1\u0001 by 1\u0001 and\nfrequencies in the range of 11.75\u201312.75 kHz. The swath data\nallowed detailedmapping of the shape of the seafloor. Profiles\nof the sound velocity structure of the water column were\nFigure 1.

The 500 m (thin solid\nlines) and 600 m (thin dashed lines) bathymetric contours on the shelf are based on multibeam echo\nsounder data from cruise JR104 of the RRS James Clark Ross, cruises of the R\/V Nathaniel B Palmer\nand R\/V Polarstern, and a collation of single beam soundings provided by the UK Hydrographic Office.\nCharted water depths of less than 500 m are indicated by the grey fill.\nB11103 O\u00b4 COFAIGH ET AL.: WEST ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET FLOW AT LGM\n2 of 13\nB11103\ncollected regularly during the cruise using expendable\nbathythermographs (XBTs). The sound velocity profiles\nwere input to the swath bathymetry acquisition system in\norder to correct for the varying velocity and refraction of\nsound waves through the water column. Data processing\nwas carried out using Kongsberg-Simrad NEPTUNE\nsoftware and involved removal of anomalous data points\nand application of the sound-velocity profiles derived\nfrom the XBT data. The EM120 data were gridded at\ncell sizes of 50\u2013100 m depending on water depth and\nthus survey size. Vertical and horizontal uncertainties are\nabout 1 m and 5 m, respectively.\n[7] The TOPAS parametric acoustic profiler produces a\nnarrow (5\u0001) beam with user-specified secondary frequencies\nin the range of 0.5 to 5 kHz. Generally, on the continental\nshelf in water depths of less than 1000 m, the TOPAS\nsystem was operated with a transmitted signal consisting of\njust one or two cycles of a fixed secondary frequency of\n2.8 kHz. Vertical resolution is better than 1 m. The maxi-\nmum depth of sediment penetration by TOPAS is variable\nand depends on the nature of the sediments. In general, fine\ngrained sediments can be imaged by TOPAS to greater\ndepths (>150 m penetration can be achieved) than coarser\ngrained and poorly sorted deposits (typically <40 m). In this\nstudy TOPAS generally penetrated sediments to depths of\nbetween 2 and \u000125 m. Navigation data were acquired using\ndifferential GPS. The area of geophysical data acquisition is\nshown in Figure 1.\n[8] Core GC374 was recovered with a gravity corer at\n70\u000130.00S and 86\u000114.20W from a water depth of 650 m. The\ncore recovery was 1.96 m. Magnetic susceptibility and wet\nbulk density were measured on the whole core at the British\nOcean Sediment Core Research Facility (National Ocean-\nography Centre, Southampton, UK), using a GEOTEK\nmultisensor core logger. Shear strength was measured with\na torvane on the split core. The water content was deter-\nmined on discrete samples.\n3. Geophysical Data\n3.1. Ronne Entrance\n[9] Swath bathymetric data show glacial geomorpholog-\nical evidence for two flow sets that record ice flow out of\nthe Ronne Entrance: a WNW oriented set of bed forms\nrecording flow into the head of Belgica Trough and another\nNNWoriented set recording flow into a probable cross-shelf\nbathymetric trough west of Beethoven Peninsula (Figures 1\nand 2a). The NNW flow set comprises well-developed,\nattenuated drumlins and megascale glacial lineations that\nare up to 12\u201313 km long, 100\u2013600 m wide, \u000310 m high,\nwith elongation ratios of between 15:1 and 51:1, and which\noccur in water depths of 600\u2013700 m (Figure 2c). Some\ndrumlins have well-developed, crescent-shaped, overdeep-\nenings around their upstream ends. The set of WNW\noriented bed forms occurs in water depths of less than\n\u0001550 m where the trough shallows upward to the side of\nSmyley Island (Figure 2a). Bed forms are less well devel-\noped than the NNW flow set and are typically shorter;\nusually about 3 km in length, exceptionally reaching 7 km.\n[10] Streamlined bed forms are generally absent from\nthe intervening area of the trough between these two flow\nsets (Figure 2a). Water depths in this intervening area are\n600\u2013700 m. TOPAS subbottom profiler records from the\nmouth of the Ronne Entrance commonly show a rough\nseafloor with little sediment. However, at about 71\u0001550S\nand 76\u0001100W an acoustically transparent unit up to 12 m\nthick, with occasional faint internal reflectors, overlies\na prominent, typically smooth subbottom reflector\n(Figure 2e).\n[11] Faint lineations oriented WNW do occur, however,\nabout 25 km further downflow in water depths of 600\u2013\n700 m, where they record ice flow from the Ronne Entrance\ntoward the head of Belgica Trough (Figure 2a). TOPAS data\nshow that, internally, the lineations are composed of acous-\ntically transparent sediment and form isolated ridges sitting\non the seafloor (Figure 2d). Megascale glacial lineations\n(MSGL) recording the continuation of this WNW flow were\nimaged at 71\u0001480S and 79\u0001150W (Figures 1 and 2b). These\nMSGL are up to 10 km in length, have elongation ratios up\nto 46:1, and occur in water depths of \u0001570\u2013620 m. TOPAS\ndata from this area show that the lineations are formed in a\npatchy unit of acoustically transparent sediment that excep-\ntionally reaches a maximum thickness of about 14 m and\noverlies a subbottom reflector.\n3.2. Eltanin Bay\n[12] Eltanin Bay is located west of the Ronne Entrance\nand Smyley Island (Figure 1). Water depths in the bay range\nfrom about 500 to 1200 m. Streamlined subglacial bed\nforms were imaged on the floor of Eltanin Bay using\nmultibeam swath bathymetry and these new data build on\nprevious multibeam surveys [Wellner et al., 2001]. Crudely\nstreamlined forms and drumlins, some with crescentic over-\ndeepenings around their stoss ends, occur in the inner bay\nbetween 73\u0001080S and about 72\u000140s (Figure 3). Bed form\nlengths range from 1 to 10 km. The rough appearance of the\ncrudely streamlined bed forms on the swath bathymetric\nrecords, their similarly rough and irregular appearance on\nTOPAS records and associated lack of acoustic penetration,\nimply that they are formed predominantly in bedrock (i.e.,\ncrystalline rocks or lithified sediments) and\/or that uncon-\nsolidated sediment cover is thin and localized.\n[13] The orientation of the bed forms indicates that flow\nfrom Eltanin Bay was convergent with ice flow emanating\nfrom bays west of Smyley Island (as recorded by stream-\nlined bedrock \u2013 Figure 3), and this convergent flow focused\nnorthward into Belgica Trough. Drumlins evolve into\nMSGL in the trough north of about 72\u0001350S (Figure 4a).\nIn Pine Island Bay, Lowe and Anderson [2002] observed\nthat the transition from drumlins to MSGL occurred at the\nexact position where a seismic reflection profile revealed\nthe landward edge of a wedge of unconsolidated sediment.\nThe substrate may exert a similar control here, but no\nseismic profiles have yet been collected in Eltanin Bay.\nThe orientation of the bed forms indicates that ice flow was\ninitially northward out of Eltanin Bay to about 72\u0001250S,\nwhere it then swung around to a more NW orientation as\nrecorded by MSGL in Belgica Trough.\n3.3. Belgica Trough\n[14] MSGL occur in water depths of 560\u2013700 m on the\nfloor of Belgica Trough (Figures 4 and 5).

TOPAS data\nfrom the MSGL show that they are developed in the upper\npart of an acoustically transparent sediment unit that is up to\nabout 17 m thick and which is underlain by a prominent\nsubbottom reflector (Figure 5b). Typically, this unit appears\nto be homogeneous internally. However, in some locations\ninternal reflectors are present and the unit is overlain by 3\u2013\n4 m of sediment characterized by a more prolonged acoustic\nreturn. The MSGL record former ice flow along the trough\ntoward the edge of the continental shelf.\n[15] Core GC374 was recovered from the acoustically\ntransparent unit in outer Belgica Trough (Figure 1). There\nare four units in the core (Figure 6). The lowermost 161 cm\ncomprises a massive, homogenous, grey diamict. This unit\nis predominantly dark grey (N4\/) but undergoes a sharp\ncolor change to 2.5Y 4\/2 4 cm from its top. The diamict\nis overlain gradationally by 21 cm of greyish brown (2.5Y\n4\/2), mottled terrigenous sandy mud, the lowermost 4 cm\nof which comprises a gravely layer. The sandy mud is\noverlain by 8 cm of gravel-bearing, bioturbated muddy sand\n(5Y 4\/2), and the core is capped by 4 cm of greyish brown\n(10YR 4\/2), bioturbated foraminiferal ooze. The shear\nstrength of the foraminiferal ooze, muddy sand and sandy\nmud is less than 12 kPa, whereas shear strength increases to\nvalues >20 kPa within the diamict. Wet bulk density\nexhibits a significant downcore increase from the forami-\nniferal ooze to the upper part of the sandy mud unit but only\na slight increase in the underlying sediments. The water\ncontent decreases downcore, reflecting an inverse correla-\ntion with wet bulk density. Some of the major peaks in wet\nbulk density and magnetic susceptibility are related to the\npresence of pebbles and cobbles that were observed in the\nsplit core. The diamict below c. 80 cm core depth is\ninterpreted as a subglacial till deposited by a grounded ice\nstream during the last glacial period based on its massive\nstructure, high shear strength and low water content [cf.\nDomack et al., 1999; Evans and Pudsey, 2002; O\u00b4 Cofaigh et\nal., 2005; Hillenbrand et al., 2005]. The upper part of the\nmassive diamict facies (shear strength <12 kPa) and the\noverlying sandy mud, which underlie the foraminiferal\nooze, were probably deposited during deglaciation, and\nrecord the initial transition from grounded to floating ice.\nThe foraminiferal ooze is interpreted as a product of\nglaciomarine sedimentation under seasonally open marine\nconditions during the present interglacial.\n[16] Swath bathymetric data from outer Belgica Trough at\n71\u0001S 84\u0001W show MSGL in water depths of 560\u2013620 m.\nThe lineations are terminated downflow by irregularly\nshaped furrows which are interpreted as iceberg scours\n(Figure 5a).

Iceberg\nscours are also present outside of the trough on the\nshallower banks in water depths of less than 460 m\n(Figure 5a). MSGL were mapped northward to within\n40 km of the shelf edge at 70\u0001370S (Figure 4b). North of\nthis location, the seabed is iceberg scoured and the quality\nof multibeam data obtained on the outer shelf was poor due\nto extensive sea ice. TOPAS records show that the MSGL\nare developed in the upper part of an acoustically transpar-\nent sediment unit that can be 30\u201340 m thick and overlies a\nstrong subbottom reflector.\n[17] In several locations in the inner and middle parts of\nBelgica Trough, TOPAS data show sediment accumulations\nwith steeply dipping, subbottom reflectors, which are\ntruncated by a flat to gently dipping reflector that is, in\nturn, overlain by an acoustically transparent sediment unit\n(Figure 7). This acoustic sequence bears similarities to the\nforesets and top sets of Gilbert-type deltas, and it is similar\nto the till deltas or grounding zone wedges (GZWs) de-\nscribed previously from the Antarctic continental shelf [cf.\nAlley et al., 1989; Larter and Vanneste, 1995; Vanneste and\nLarter, 1995; Anderson, 1997, 1999; Bart and Anderson,\n1997]. These features are therefore interpreted as GZWs.\n[18] Figure 7b shows a GZW between 72\u0001150S 82\u0001100W\nand 72\u0001320S 82\u0001380W. In dimensions it is over 20 m thick\nand about 40 km long; although it is possible that it is a\ncomposite feature composed of more than one back-step-\nping GZW. It terminates at a prominent scarp 25\u201330 m high\nat its downflow end (Figure 7b). The swath bathymetric\ndata suggest that this scarp may be slightly oblique to\nformer ice flow. MSGL are incised into the surface of the\nGZW but do not continue across the scarp, and MSGL also\ninitiate immediately downflow of the scarp (Figure 4a). The\nscarp therefore interrupts the MSGL. A second smaller\nscarp occurs at 72\u0001330S 82\u0001390W. This scarp is about 5\u2013\n6 m in height. MSGL are incised into its upper surface and\nalso occur immediately downflow of the scarp. However,\nonce again it appears that the scarp interrupts the MSGL and\nthe bed forms do not continue across it. The surface of the\nother GZWs identified on TOPAS records are either iceberg\nscoured or severe pack ice resulted in the swath data being\nof poor quality.\n3.4. Continental Slope\n[19] Belgica Trough is about 150 km wide where it\nreaches the edge of the continental shelf (Figure 8). The\nshelf break occurs in water depths of 600\u2013670 m, and\niceberg plough marks are present on the seafloor at, and\ninshore of this. Bathymetric contours on the upper slope are\nfairly straight in profile down to about 1200 m (Figure 8a).\nBelow this depth, however, the contours exhibit a distinct\nbulge shape, which extends down to at least 2400 m (the\nlimit of data coverage). The outward bulging of slope\ncontours is limited to the area directly in front of Belgica\nTrough. TOPAS records from the continental slope in front\nof the trough mouth show the presence of acoustically\ntransparent lenses of sediment (Figures 8b and 8c). Nitsche\net al. [2000] describe two multichannel seismic reflection\nprofiles which trend NW-SE and cross the continental shelf\nedge in the vicinity of 87\u0001300W in front of the trough mouth.\nThe profiles are less than 25 km apart and show prograded\ndepositional sequences that indicate seaward migration of\nFigure 4.

Discussion\n4.1. Ice Sheet Dynamics and Relationship to the\nSubglacial Substrate\n[20] Ice flow through Belgica Trough is inferred to have\nbeen in the form of a fast flowing ice stream, based on\nseveral lines of evidence. (1) The bed forms are located in a\ncross-shelf bathymetric trough and such troughs are com-\nmonly the loci of modern and Quaternary ice streams\n[Stokes and Clark, 1999; Vaughan et al., 2001, 2003; O\u00b4\nCofaigh et al., 2005; Evans et al., 2005]. (2) There is a\nconvergent pattern of ice flow feeding into the head of the\ntrough [Stokes and Clark, 1999]. (3) A downflow transition\nin subglacial bed forms within the trough, from drumlins to\nMSGL has been observed [cf. Wellner et al., 2001; O\u00b4\nCofaigh et al., 2002; Stokes and Clark, 2002, 2003;\nDowdeswell et al., 2004]. Crescentic overdeepenings\naround the upstream ends of several drumlins in Eltanin\nBay are regarded as the product of localized meltwater\nerosion. Such elongate subglacial bed forms have now been\nobserved beneath the region of accelerating ice flow in the\nupstream part of the modern Rutford Ice Stream in Antarc-\ntica [King et al., 2003]. King et al. [2004] have also reported\nevidence of channelized subglacial meltwater flow beneath\na neighboring part of this ice stream, which is consistent\nwith our interpretation of localized meltwater erosion in\nEltanin Bay. (4) MSGL are the most elongate subglacial bed\nform that we document and they are formed in the upper\npart of an acoustically transparent sediment unit in the\nFigure 5.

A similar acoustic facies has been described from\nother paleoice stream troughs around Antarctica, and sedi-\nment cores show that it is typically a weak, massive diamict\nthat is the product of subglacial deformation [O\u00b4 Cofaigh et\nal., 2002, 2005; Dowdeswell et al., 2004; Evans et al.,\n2005]. On the basis of the acoustic properties of the\nsediment unit within Belgica Trough, we similarly interpret\nit as a subglacial till that may, at least partially, be the\nFigure 7. Grounding zone wedges (GZW) on the continental shelf of the Bellingshausen Sea.\n(a) Location of grounding zone wedges in the study area. (b) GZW in Belgica Trough. The dashed line\nshows the extent of the feature. It is possible that this is a composite landform composed of several back-\nstepping GZWs. Note the dipping foreset reflectors that are truncated by the gently dipping overlying\nreflector; the capping acoustically transparent sediment unit (top sets); the distinct wedge shape of the\nGZW with an abrupt and steep distal face.\nFigure 6. Lithology, physical properties, and water content of core GC374 from outer Belgica Trough.\nLocation of core is shown in Figure 1.\nB11103 O\u00b4 COFAIGH ET AL.: WEST ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET FLOW AT LGM\n8 of 13\nB11103\nproduct of sediment deformation. A subglacial till interpre-\ntation is also supported by core GC374 which was recov-\nered from the acoustically transparent unit in outer Belgica\nTrough. At least the lower section of the structureless\ndiamict, which exhibits high shear strength, is interpreted\nas a subglacial till [cf. Wellner et al., 2001; Dowdeswell et\nal., 2004; O\u00b4 Cofaigh et al., 2005; Evans et al., 2005].\nMSGL formation is therefore associated with the presence\nof a soft till layer within the trough.\n[21] In addition, the outward bulging bathymetric con-\ntours in front of Belgica Trough (Figure 8) and the acous-\ntically transparent sediment lenses imaged by TOPAS on the\nslope are interpreted as representing a trough mouth fan\ncomposed of debris flow deposits [cf. Laberg and Vorren,\n1995, 2000; Taylor et al., 2002; O\u00b4 Cofaigh et al., 2003]. In\nconjunction with seismic profiles from the outermost shelf\nand upper slope [Cunningham et al., 1994; Nitsche et al.,\n1997], these data imply that progradation of the margin\noccurred in front of Belgica Trough [cf. Vorren et al., 1989,\n1998; Dowdeswell et al., 1996]. Trough mouth fans are\nformed where ice sheets reach the continental shelf break,\ntypically as fast flowing ice streams, and deliver large\nvolumes of glaciogenic sediment directly to the upper slope\nby debris flow processes [Vorren and Laberg, 1997; Vorren\net al., 1998; O\u00b4 Cofaigh et al., 2003].\n[22] GZWs on the midshelf and inner shelf comprise\nlocalized sediment accumulations, characterized by dip-\nping subbottom reflectors truncated by a gently dipping\nreflector and overlain by acoustically transparent sediment\n(Figure 7). Such GZWs are formed by the deposition of\nunconsolidated, saturated till that is transported subgla-\ncially by an ice stream and deposited at the grounding\nline [cf. Alley et al., 1989]. Top set beds are a product of\ndirect deposition as basal till at the ice stream base, while\nforeset beds are formed by release of till at the grounding\nline and subsequent remobilization of this sediment by\ndebris flow processes. GZWs can be formed during either\nice sheet advance, ice sheet retreat or during a readvance\nof the ice margin. Swath bathymetric records of GZWs in\ninner Belgica Trough show that MSGL are incised into\nthe surface of the wedges but do not continue across\nthem; that is the fronts of the GZWs (transverse sediment\nscarps) interrupt the MSGL (Figure 4a). This indicates\nthat the episodes of grounding zone stabilization did not\noccur during ice sheet advance because, in that case, the\nMSGL would be continuous across the scarps that mark\nFigure 8.

This implies that the GZWs formed during\neither ice sheet retreat or during readvances of the ice\nmargin. Such readvances are most likely to have occurred\nduring regional deglaciation, hence the timing of GZW\nformation would have been broadly similar in both cases.\nIceberg scours occur in the outer part of Belgica Trough\nin water depths of greater than 600 m (Figure 5a). The\ndepth of these scours within the trough suggests that they\nare associated with ploughing by large icebergs calved\nfrom the retreating ice sheet margin during regional\ndeglaciation.\n[23] The location of ice streams is commonly associated\nwith areas of soft substrate, either in the form of unconsol-\nidated sediments, or soft and easily erodible bedrock\n[Anandakrishnan et al., 1998; Studinger et al., 2001].\nStreaming over these soft beds is either by subglacial\nsediment deformation or basal sliding, or some combination\nof these processes [Alley et al., 1986; Engelhardt and\nKamb, 1998; Kamb, 2001]. It has also been suggested,\nbased primarily on investigations of paleoice streams, that\nstreaming can occur over areas of hard bed composed of\ncrystalline bedrock [Evans, 1996; O\u00b4 Cofaigh et al., 2002;\nStokes and Clark, 2003]. In some localities on the Antarctic\ncontinental shelf, a transition from streamlined crystalline\nbedrock to drumlins, and then to MSGL in soft sediments\nhas been observed [Shipp et al., 1999; Wellner et al., 2001].\nThis geomorphological transition has been inferred to\nrepresent a downflow change from slow ice sheet flow over\nthe crystalline bedrock, to a zone of flow acceleration\nrecorded by the drumlins (representing the onset zone of\nan ice stream), to the high velocities of the main ice stream\ntrunk as recorded by the MSGL [Wellner et al., 2001].\n[24] On the basis of their rough and irregular appearance\non the swath records, and the apparent absence of sediment\non TOPAS records, the crudely streamlined forms in inner\nEltanin Bay appear to be formed largely in bedrock. North\nof about 72\u0001350S and west of 81\u0001W these crudely stream-\nlined forms evolve into drumlins and then MSGL. The\nMSGL in Belgica Trough are formed in an acoustically\ntransparent sediment unit that is interpreted as a till.\nAssuming the most elongate bed forms record the highest\nflow velocities [cf. Clark, 1993; Stokes and Clark, 1999,\n2002; O\u00b4 Cofaigh et al., 2002], MSGL record streaming flow\nthrough Belgica Trough toward the shelf edge. Thus the\nhighest inferred flow velocities occurred over the area\nof soft bed. Shorter bed forms in Eltanin Bay that\nexhibit a convergent orientation are predominantly formed\nin bedrock.\n[25] We propose that the zone of crudely streamlined\nbedrock and drumlins in Eltanin Bay represents the onset\nzone of a paleoice stream in Belgica Trough. Streaming\nFigure 9. Paleoice flow directions in the study area mapped from the orientation of streamlined\nsubglacial bed forms. Note bifurcation of flow emanating from the Ronne Entrance and convergence of\nflow into the head of Belgica Trough. Area enclosed by solid line represents the interpreted extent of the\nBelgica Trough drainage basin assuming that the main ice divide during times of glacial maximum was in\nthe same position as today. The area to the west also enclosed by a solid line is a possible additional part\nof the drainage basin. Much of the ice sheet bed in Ellsworth Land is near or below sea level, and the ice\ndivide in this area may have been in a different position at glacial maximum. Map projection is polar\nstereographic.\nB11103 O\u00b4 COFAIGH ET AL.: WEST ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET FLOW AT LGM\n10 of 13\nB11103\nwould be enhanced by the presence of a topographic trough,\nwhich would facilitate strain heating and an increase in\nvelocity [cf. Iken et al., 1993]. However, the relationship of\nthe MSGL to the area of the trough underlain by a soft bed\nimplies that subglacial geology also acted as a major control\non the development of streaming flow.\n4.2. Paleoglaciology of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet on\nthe Bellingshausen Sea Margin at the LGM\n[26] The streamlined subglacial bed forms imaged by\nswath bathymetry in Belgica Trough, Eltanin Bay and the\nRonne Entrance record flow of a grounded ice stream\ntoward the edge of the continental shelf. Flow directions\nmapped from the orientation of the bed forms show that ice\nflow into the head of Belgica Trough was the result of\nconvergence of ice emanating from Eltanin Bay and the\nRonne Entrance (Figure 9). This coalescent ice mass then\nflowed along the trough, and reached at least as far north as\n70\u0001370S on the outermost shelf. Belgica Trough was thus\nthe pathway for a major ice sheet outlet that was fed by ice\ndraining from the southern part of the Antarctic Peninsula\nIce Sheet through the Ronne Entrance, as well as ice from\nthe WAIS draining through Eltanin Bay. These ice masses\ncoalesced in Belgica Trough and extended to the outermost\ncontinental shelf and probably the shelf edge (Figure 9).\nThe presence of an additional outlet that flowed northward\nout of the Ronne Entrance, is implied by the NNW\norientated MSGL and drumlins immediately west of Beet-\nhoven Peninsula (Figures 1 and 2).\n[27] The subglacial bed forms that we document record\nthe most recent episode of ice stream advance through\nBelgica Trough to the continental shelf edge. We estimate\nthe area of the drainage basin that fed this ice stream by\nassuming that the main ice divides in West Antarctica and\nPalmer Land at times of glacial maximum were in the same\npositions as today. We inferred the positions of the lateral\nboundaries of the drainage basin on the basis of topographic\ndata and paleoice flow directions interpreted from the\nmultibeam data. By this method we conclude that the basin\nprobably encompassed southwestern Palmer Land and parts\nof southern Alexander Island and the Bryan Coast of Ells-\nworth Land (Figure 9). An additional part of the Bryan\nCoast farther west may also have contributed ice to the\nBelgica Trough, but we only observe bed forms that suggest\nflow from this region in one small area. During periods\nwhen the Belgica Trough paleoice stream reached the\ncontinental shelf edge, the total area of the drainage basin\nfeeding this outlet would have been about 217,000 km2 if it\ndid not include the western part of the Bryan Coast, and\nabout 256,000 km2 if it did include that region.\n[28] Bedrock topography in central Palmer Land rises\n1500\u20132000 m above sea level and has an important\neffect in concentrating precipitation [Turner et al.,\n2002]. Therefore we consider it unlikely that the main\nice divide was displaced from central Palmer Land at\ntimes of glacial maximum. However, between 73\u0001W and\nthe Ellsworth Mountains (Figure 9), bedrock topography\nis generally of low elevation and three-dimensional mod-\nels of the glacial maximum WAIS show the main divide\nin Ellsworth Land offset to the south of its present\nposition [e.g., Stuiver et al., 1981; Huybrechts et al.,\n2002]. Our estimate of 217,000\u2013256,000 km2 for the area\nof the drainage basin feeding the Belgica Trough ice stream\ncompares with areas of 48,000\u2013570,000 km2 for modern\ndrainage basins within the WAIS, and a total area of\ngrounded ice in the modern WAIS of about 2,000,000 km2\n[Vaughan et al., 1999]. The only two modern drainage\nbasins within the WAIS that exceed 300,000 km2 in area\n(Siple Coast and Pine Island-Thwaites) are composite basins\nwith more than one outlet.\n[29] The present net surface mass balance in the parts\nof Palmer Land and Ellsworth Land that we interpret as\nhaving been within the Belgica Trough drainage basin is\n>500 kg m\u00052 yr \u00051, which is more than three times the\nAntarctic average of 149 kg m\u00052 yr\u00051 [Vaughan et al.,\n1999; Turner et al., 2002]. If net surface mass balance was\nalso higher than average in this area during glacial periods,\nthen the outflow from the basin would have been dispro-\nportionately large compared to its area. Therefore the\nBelgica Trough probably represents one of the main outlets\nof the WAIS during late Quaternary glacial periods.\n[30] Glacial trim lines on the northern part of the eastern\nflank of the Ellsworth Mountains (Figure 9) indicate a\nformer ice surface elevation up to 1900 m above present,\nignoring isostatic compensation [Denton et al., 1992]. This\nobservation is consistent with the hypothesis that a major\nice divide was close to the northern end of the range during\nglacial periods. However, the age of the trim lines remains\nunknown, so it is not clear whether or not they represent the\nLGM ice surface, and it is even possible that they formed in\npre-Quaternary times [Denton et al., 1992].\n[31] Although there is some crosscutting of bed forms in\nthe outer shelf trough (Figure 4b), this is localized in\noccurrence and relatively minor. The trajectory of former\nice flow through the trough was consistently toward the\nshelf edge (Figure 9). MSGL are formed in the upper part of\na subglacial till unit, and in core section this till is overlain\ndirectly by deglacial and postglacial sediments (Figure 6).\nThese sediments are typically \u00030.5 m in thickness. The\nstreamlined subglacial bed forms that we image on the floor\nof Belgica Trough formed during the most recent episode of\nice advance to the shelf edge. In conjunction with the thin\nsequence of deglacial and postglacial sediments that overlie\nthe till associated with this advance, the simplest interpre-\ntation is that the timing of ice sheet advance occurred during\nthe last glaciation and that grounded ice therefore reached\nthe shelf edge at the LGM.\n[32] The new data presented in this paper fill a major gap\nin reconstructions of the Antarctic Ice Sheet during the last\nglacial cycle [cf. Bentley and Anderson, 1998; Bentley,\n1999]. They indicate an extensive WAIS at the LGM on\nthe Bellingshausen Sea continental margin, which advanced\nto the continental shelf edge. In conjunction with data from\nfurther to the west in Pine Island Bay [Lowe and Anderson,\n2002; Dowdeswell et al., 2005; J. Evans et al., Extent and\ndynamics of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet on the outer\ncontinental shelf of Pine Island Bay, Amundsen Sea, during\nthe last glaciation, submitted to Marine Geology, 2005] and\nnortheast around the Antarctic Peninsula [Pudsey et al.,\n1994; O\u00b4 Cofaigh et al., 2002, 2005; Evans et al., 2004,\n2005] this implies an extensive ice sheet configuration\nduring the LGM along the Antarctic Peninsula, Belling-\nshausen Sea, and Amundsen Sea margins, characterized by\nfast flowing ice streams which drained extensive basins of\nB11103 O\u00b4 COFAIGH ET AL.: WEST ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET FLOW AT LGM\n11 of 13\nB11103\nthe WAIS and Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet through cross-\nshelf bathymetric troughs, and reached the outermost shelf\nor shelf edge.\n5. Conclusions\n[33] 1. Geophysical data show that during the last glacial\ncycle Belgica Trough supported a major, grounded outlet of\nan expanded WAIS that drained to the continental shelf\nedge as a fast flowing ice stream. The drainage basin\nfeeding this outlet encompassed parts of southern Alexander\nIsland, southwestern Palmer Land and the Bryan Coast\nof Ellsworth Land. Its total area would have exceeded\n200,000 km2.\n[34] 2. Streamlined bedrock and drumlins mapped by\nswath bathymetry show that this ice stream was fed by\nconvergent ice flow from Eltainin Bay and bays immedi-\nately to the east, as well as by ice flow draining the southern\npart of the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet through the Ronne\nEntrance.\n[35] 3. The former presence of an ice stream in Belgica\nTrough is recorded by MSGL formed in soft till and a major\ntrough mouth fan on the continental margin in front of the\ntrough. TOPAS subbottom profiler data reveal that the\nsurface of this fan is composed of debris flow deposits.\n[36] 4. The relationship of MSGL to the area of Belgica\nTrough underlain by a soft bed implies that subglacial\ngeology acted a major control on streaming flow in Belgica\nTrough and probably augmented the topographic control\nimposed by the trough. Grounding zone wedges within\nBelgica Trough record stillstands of the ice sheet margin\nduring deglaciation and imply a staggered pattern of retreat.\n[37] 5. These new data indicate an extensive WAIS at the\nLGM on the Bellingshausen Sea margin, which advanced to\nthe continental shelf edge. In conjunction with paleoglacio-\nlogical reconstructions from further to the south and north,\nthis implies that ice sheet configuration during the LGM\nalong the Antarctic Peninsula, Bellingshausen Sea and\nAmundsen Sea margins was regionally extensive. Fast\nflowing ice streams drained the WAIS and Antarctic Pen-\ninsula Ice Sheet through cross-shelf bathymetric troughs\nand reached the outermost shelf and shelf edge.\n[38] Acknowledgments.
