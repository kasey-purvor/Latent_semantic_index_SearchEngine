People\nmust also learn to apply tools and knowledge in new domains and different situations.\nIndustry specialists report that people at every organizational level must be creative and\nflexible problem solvers (Lynton, 1989). This requires the ability to apply experience and\n5\nR. Scott Grabinger and Joanna C Dun\/op Rich environments for active learning: a definition\nknowledge to address novel problems. Consequently, learning to think critically, to\nanalyse and synthesize information to solve technical, social, economic, political, and\nscientific problems, and to work productively in groups are crucial skills for successful\nand fulfilling participation in our modern, competitive society.\nThe purpose of this article is to describe and organize the shared elements of Rich\nEnvironments for Active Learning, or REALs, including the theoretical foundations and\ninstructional strategies to provide a common ground for discussion. REALs are based on\nconstructivist values and theories including 'collaboration, personal autonomy,\ngenerativity, reflectivity, active engagement, personal relevance, and pluralism' (Lebow,\n1993, p. 5). REALs provide learning activities that, instead of transferring knowledge to\nstudents, engage students in a continuous collaborative process of building and reshaping\nunderstanding as a natural consequence of their experiences and authentic interactions\nwith the world (Goodman, 1984; Forman and Pufall, 1988; Fosnot, 1989). Advocating a\nholistic approach to education, REALs reflect-, the assumption that the process of\nknowledge acquisition is 'firmly embedded in the social and emotional context in which\nlearning takes place' (Lebow, 1993, p. 6).\nNeed for educational change\nChanging society\nEducation is receiving increasing pressure from changing global economic circumstances\nand complex societal needs. Yet, according to Lynton (1989, p. 23), 'at this time [...]\neducation is far from fully contributing to the economic well-being of this country\n[United States]'. Public and private institutions are demanding employees who can think\ncritically and solve a range of problems, who can move easily from task to task, and who\ncan work efficiently and effectively in team situations; yet they claim that those people are\ndifficult to find.\nThe US education system, to its credit, is neither deaf to this plea nor ignorant of the need\nto change how and what instruction is delivered in the classroom. Calls for restructuring\nthe way students learn come from a variety of institutions including the American\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science (1989) and the National Council of Teachers\nfor Mathematics (1989). Educators agree that students must learn to solve problems and\nthink independently (Feuerstein, 1979; Mann, 1979; Segal et al, 1985; Linn, 1986; Resnick\nand Klopfer, 1989; Bransford et al, 1990). The challenge for educators is to utilize\nstrategies that teach content in ways that also help to develop thinking, problem-solving,\nmetacognitive, and life-long learning skills (Bransford et al, 1990; Savery and Duffy, 1994).\nWeaknesses within the current system\nThere is considerable evidence that today's students are not particularly strong in the\nareas of thinking and reasoning (Resnick, 1987; Nickerson, 1988; Bransford et al, 1991).\nBransford et al (1990, pp. 115-16) state that the 'basic problem is that traditional\ninstruction often fails to produce the kinds of transfer to new problem-solving situations\nthat most educators would like to see'. Conventional instruction often utilizes simplified,\ndecontextualized examples and problems, leading to an inadequate understanding of and\n6\nALT-] Volume 3 Number 2\nability to apply the knowledge acquired. Students often are not exposed to examples and\nproblems that make knowledge relevant to them (Collins et al, 1991). Instead, students\nare asked to solve problems that cause them to wonder: 'Why do I need to know this?'.\nBecause the information presented to students has no relevance or meaning for them, they\ntend to treat new information as facts to be memorized and recited rather than as tools to\nsolve problems relevant to their own needs (Bransford et al, 1990). This, unfortunately,\nleads to inert knowledge - knowledge that cannot be applied to real problems and\nsituations.\nInert knowledge\nResearch shows that knowledge learned but not explicitly related to relevant problem-\nsolving remains inert (Whitehead, 1929; Perfetto et al, 1983, CTGV, 1993c). Whitehead\nfirst coined the phrase inert knowledge in 1929 to refer to knowledge acquired in abstract\ncircumstances without direct relevance to the learner's needs. Inert knowledge is not\nreadily available for application or transfer to novel situations (for a review of transfer\nresearch, refer to Clark and Voogel, 1985; Butterfield and Nelson, 1989). It seems that\nour educational system is focused on producing inert knowledge. The Cognition and\nTechnology Group at Vanderbilt (CTGV) (CTGV, 1993c) specifies the following flaws in\nour conventional approaches to schooling and teaching that lead to inert knowledge:\n\u2022 There is a constant battle of breadth versus depth - and breadth usually wins. We\n(educators) tend to fill our students with facts, and leave no time for dealing with\ntopics in depth. We expect our students to remember dates, formulae, algorithms,\nquotations, and whole poems, yet show little practical use for that knowledge despite\nthe fact that we know our students have difficulty transferring the knowledge.\nRobertson (1990) states that:\nStudents who rely on memorized algorithms for solving problems typically do not\nperform as well on transfer problems as do students who rely on an understanding of the\nunderlying concepts, (p. 253)\n\u2022 We consistently rely on decontextualized instructional strategies. In our desire to cover\nas much material as possible, we focus our instructional activities on abstract basic\nskills, concepts, and technical definitions. We believe that decontextualized skills have\nbroad applicability and are unaffected by the activities or environments in which they\nare acquired and used (Brown et al, 1989). However, when we do this, students do not\nlearn when to apply those skills or within what kinds of contexts they work. We do this\ndespite a large body of evidence that indicates that abstracted skills are seldom\ntransferred from one domain to another (Clark and Voogel, 1985; Butterfield and\nNelson, 1989). We fail to realize that abstracted skills have no contextual cues to relate\nto new situations.\n\u2022 When we do provide practice for our students, we give them arbitrary, uninteresting,\nunrealistic problems to solve. The example of story problems in mathematics is over-\nused. We can also find examples of unrealistic and over-simplified problems in the\nsciences, languages, and social studies. Again, we do this in the mistaken belief that we\nmust emphasize decontextualized skills that are applicable everywhere. Yet these\nunrealistic problems have no meaning to the students who then fail to find any\ncontextual cues to relate to problems they may encounter in their lives.\n7\nR Scott Grabinger and Joanna C Dunlap Rich environments for active learning a definition\n\u2022 We treat students passively for 12 to 16 years, rarely giving them the opportunity to\ntake responsibility for their own learning, to explore ideas of their own choosing, to\ncollaborate with one another or with teachers, or to make valuable contributions to the\nlearning of others. They do not learn to takl'charge of their own learning, nor do they\nlearn the skills necessary to become life-long learners and daily problem-solvers.\nTo the preceding four items cited in the CTGV article, we add a couple more to the list of\nconventional educational practices that foster the production of inert knowledge:\n\u2022 Students are not evaluated in authentic ways. After teaching in decontextualized ways,\nwe test in the same ways. We do not look at actual performance but use paper-pencil\ntests to measure the quantity of knowledge learned. We fail to examine the quality of\ntheir thinking or problem-solving.\n\u2022 Finally, our current school practices often have negative effects on the morale and\nmotivation of students. Perelman (1992) states:\nStudents are forced to compete to achieve as much as they can within the periods of time\nallotted for each activity. This design requires that most students fail or do less well most\nof the time so that a minority of them can be labelled 'excellent.' The main functional\nfocus of the system is not 'learning,' it is 'screening out', (p. 72)\nThis has a tremendous effect on society. Drop-out rates are higher than our society can\nafford. We have created an evaluation, testing, and grading sub-structure that helps\nperpetuate the view that education is a game that has few winners and many losers. This\ngame teaches our students to focus on tests and grades rather than on problem-solving,\napplying knowledge, and working collaboratively in a risk-free environment. The best\nstudents learn early on that they succeed best by working by themselves as quickly as\npossible. They learn to beat the tests and win the game.\nErroneous assumptions\nWe begin to change these conventional practices by calling into question some of our\nbasic assumptions. Berryman (1991) states that the educational practices described above\nstem from five erroneous assumptions about learning that have governed education since\nthe beginning of the industrial age. He holds that we often assume incorrectly that:\n\u2022 people easily transfer learning from one situation to another if they have learned the\nfundamental skills and concepts [decontextualized];\n\u2022 learners are 'receivers' of knowledge in verbal forms from books, experts, and teachers;\n\u2022 learning is entirely behaviouristic, involving the strengthening of bonds between\nstimuli and correct responses;\n\u2022 learners are blank slates ready to be written upon and filled with knowledge; and\n\u2022 skills and knowledge are best acquired independent of realistic contexts.\nTo begin to address the issues of transfer and instructional methods to meet employer and\nsocietal needs, reasoning and problem-solving skill development must be a part of an\ninterdisciplinary program of study in education (Lynton and Elman, 1987) - a program\n8\nALT-J Volume 3 Number 2\nor environment that places students in situations where they can practise solving\nproblems in a meaningful and constructive manner.\nWe need to look at other ways\nOne view of an alternative framework comes from researchers who are beginning to\nemphasize the importance of anchoring or situating instruction in meaningful problem-\nsolving environments (CTGV, 1993c). The Cognition and Technology Group at\nVanderbilt is a leader in the development of alternative frameworks of instruction and\nschooling. The group posits two significant changes.\nFirst, we as educators must establish new goals for learning. We must move from\nemphasizing decontextualized reading and computational skills to developing independ-\nent thinkers and learners who engage in life-long learning. This does not mean that we\nabandon the important skills of reading and computation; it means instead that we\nshould be teaching reading and computation within more situated contexts that\ndemonstrate the value of those skills.\nNew assumptions about learning\nSecond, in contrast to our long operative conventional assumptions (see above), we must\nbase our teaching on new assumptions about the nature of thinking, learning, and\ninstruction. We must accept that\n[...] the mere accumulation of factual or declarative knowledge is not sufficient to support\nproblem solving. In addition to factual or declarative knowledge, students must learn why,\nwhen, and how various skills and concepts are relevant. (CTGV, 1993c, p. 79)\nEffective problem-solving and thinking are not based solely on motivation and knowledge\nof thinking strategies, but also on well-organized and indexed content knowledge.\nLearners must have rich knowledge structures with many contextual links to help them\naddress and solve complex problems. This means that instead of trying to abstract a set of\ndecontextualized general skills, we must make our teaching as contextualized as possible\nto provide as many possible links with other domains as possible.\nTherefore, we propose the following 'new' assumptions about learning and teaching:\n\u2022 People transfer learning from one situation to another with difficulty. Learning is more\nlikely to be transferred from complex and rich learning situations. Rich learning\nactivities help students think deeply about content in relevant and realistic contexts\n(CTGV, 1993c).\n\u2022 Learners are 'constructors' of knowledge in a variety of forms. They take an active role\nin forming new understandings and are not just passive receptors.\n\u2022 Learning is a collaborative process. Students learn not solely from experts and\nteachers, but also from each other. They test ideas with each other and help each other\nbuild elaborate and refined knowledge structures.\n\u2022 Learning is cognitive, and involves the processing of information and the constant\ncreation and evolution of knowledge structures. We must focus on and make visible\nthinking and reasoning processes. We are not suggesting abandoning the teaching of\n9\nR. Scott Grabinger and Joanna C Dunlap Rich environments for active learning: a definition\ncontent to teach only thinking and reasoning, because 'knowledge of concepts,\ntheories, and principles [. . .] empowers people to think effectively' (Bransford et al,\n1990, p. 115).\n\u2022 Learners bring their own needs and experiences to a learning situation and are ready to act\naccording to those needs. We must incorporate those needs and experiences into learning\nactivities to help students take ownership and responsibility for their own learning.\n\u2022 Skills and knowledge are best acquired within realistic contexts. Morris etal{\\ 979) call\nthis 'transfer appropriate processing.' Transfer appropriate processing means that\nstudents must have the opportunity to practise and learn the outcomes that are\nexpected of them under realistic or authentic conditions.\n\u2022 Assessment of students must take more realistic and holistic forms, utilizing projects\nand portfolios and de-emphasizing standardized testing. Educators are increasingly\naware that conventional achievement and intelligence tests do not measure the ability\nof people to perform in everyday settings and adapt to new situations (CTGV, 1993c).\nA discussion of the foundations for these assumptions and examples of their\nimplementation makes up the rest of this article.\nRich Environments for Active Learning\nDefinition of REALs\nWe must implement a number of strategies in order successfully to adopt the new\nassumptions about thinking, learning, instruction, and achievement described above. The\nadoption of these strategies creates learning environments that we call Rich Environments\nfor Active Learning (REALs). REALs are comprehensive instructional systems that\n(Dunlap and Grabinger, 1992,1993; Grabinger and Dunlap, 1994a, 1994b):\n\u2022 evolve from and are consistent with constructivist philosophies and theories;\n\u2022 promote study and investigation within authentic (i.e. realistic, meaningful, relevant,\ncomplex, and information-rich) contexts;\n\u2022 encourage the growth of student responsibility, initiative, decision-making, and\nintentional learning;\n\u2022 cultivate an atmosphere of knowledge-building learning communities that utilize\ncollaborative learning among students and teachers (Collins, 1995);\n\u2022 utilize dynamic, interdisciplinary, generative learning activities that promote high-level\nthinking processes (i.e. analysis, synthesis, problem-solving, experimentation,\ncreativity, and examination of topics from multiple perspectives) to help students\nintegrate new knowledge with old knowledge and thereby create rich and complex\nknowledge structures; and,\n\u2022 assess student progress in content and learning-to-Iearn through realistic tasks and\nperformances.\nIt is important to note that two of the overall defining characteristics of learning\nenvironments are integration and comprehensiveness (Hannafm, 1992). Hannafin\n10\nALT-J Volume 3 Number 2\ndescribes integration as a process of linking new knowledge to old, and modifying and\nenriching existing knowledge. Integration enhances the depth of learning to increase the\nnumber of access points to that information. As we described earlier, learning\nenvironments must go beyond general, abstracted learning to include specific learning.\nGoldman et al state that:\nThese environments are designed to invite the kinds of thinking that help students develop\ngeneral skills and attitudes that contribute to effective problem solving, plus acquire specific\nconcepts and principles that allow them to think effectively about particular domains, (p. 1)\nComprehensiveness, the second defining characteristic, carries this notion further. It refers\nto the importance of placing learning in broad, realistic contexts rather than in\ndecontextualized and compartmentalized contexts. REAL learning strategies, then, guide\nand mediate an individual's learning, and support the learner's decision-making\n(Hannafin, 1992). Themes are used to help organize learning around interdisciplinary\ncontexts that focus on problem-solving or projects that link concepts and knowledge to\nfocused activities within the environment (Hannafin, 1992).\nWhat a REAL is not\nBecause the phrase learning environment is broadly and carelessly used in educational\nliterature to describe everything from schools to classrooms to computer microworlds to\nlearning activities to air conditioning and furniture, we shall try to clarify what a REAL is\nnot before examining the attributes in more detail. We attempt to make the case that a\nREAL is a more accurate description of what people generally mean when they use the\nterm learning environment.\nFirst, a REAL is not a delivery technology like video, CD-ROM, or audio tapes. Clark\n(1994) defines delivery technologies as those that draw on resources and media to deliver\ninstruction, and affect the cost and access of instruction. Media technologies can be\nintegral components of REALs and, in fact, usually are. However, a REAL is not limited\nto any specific media, but instead is an assortment of methods and ideas that help create\nan environment that promotes and encourages active learning. Clark's point is important\nfrom a research standpoint because instructional methods are often confounded with\nmedia in research, and he argues strongly and convincingly that it is instructional\nmethods, not media, that influence learning. He contends that any necessary teaching\nmethod can usually be designed in more than one medium. Although there are varying\ndegrees of acceptance and disagreement with Clark's point of view (for example,\nJonassen, 1994b; Kozma, 1994), a REAL is a set of instructional methods designed on the\nassumptions that media are tools for students and teachers' to use, and that the learning\nthat occurs within the environment is founded on the activities and processes that\nencourage thinking and reasoning, not the media that deliver information.\nSecond, do not confuse REALs with computer-based microworlds or learner-support\nenvironments (Allinson and Hammond, 1990). Computer-based microworlds are\ncomputer programs that are designed to apply constructivist theories. Examples include\ncase-based applications, simulations, intentional learning environments, and some\nhypermedia resources. Developers of microworlds often refer to their programs as\nlearning environments because they often attempt to simulate, on a smaller simplified\nII\nR Scott Grabinger and Joanna C Dunlap Rich environments for active learning: a definition\nscale, realistic environments. However, we contend that this limits the concept of learning\nenvironment. Learning environments, and especially REALs, are much more\ncomprehensive and holistic than individual computer applications. Although some\n\"computer-based applications use constructivist ideas quite admirably - see especially the\nStrategic Teaching Framework (Duffy, 1992; Duffy, in press), and the' Transfusion\nMedicine Modules (Ambruso and The Transfusion Medicine Group, 1994) - they are not\nlearning environments in the sense that REALs are. To create REALs, teachers must\ninvolve their students, parents, administrators, and colleagues in planning and\nimplementing strategies that encourage student responsibility, active knowledge\nconstruction, and generative learning activities on a large scale and in a variety of\nmethods and forms. Microworlds may play a role in a REAL through the delivery of\ninformation, practice, finding and presenting information, stimulation of high-level\nthought processes, promotion of collaboration, or exploration; but REALs involve many\nmore activities and demand much more flexibility than can probably ever be contained in\na single computer program. A REAL is, then, a learning community that 'includes the\ncontent taught, the pedagogical methods employed, the sequencing of learning activities,\nand the sociology of learning' (Collins et al, 1991, p. 6).\nFinally, a REAL is not the physical attributes of the classroom. It is not about air\nconditioning, desks, lighting, or ergonomics. While these environmental factors are\ncritical in creating a smooth-operating learning environment, they are not included in our\ndefinition or REALs (for information about this topic, see Gayeski, 1995).\nFoundation of REALs\nREALs (i.e. constructivist learning environments, information-rich learning environ-\nments, interactive-learning environments, or knowledge-building learning communities)\nare not new to education. We can go back to Socrates and see that he used problems and\nquestions to guide students to analyse and think about their environments (Coltrane,\n1993). Rousseau prescribed using direct experience (Farnham-Diggory, 1992). In the early\n1900s, John Dewey (1910) proposed student-directed reforms and experiential learning.\nBruner (1961) advocated discovery or inquiry learning around realistic problems. The\nnotion that students should learn through practice, application, and apprenticeship has\nbeen with us for centuries. It was not until the industrial age, when we needed places to\nstore children until old enough to work on assembly lines, that we began trying to mass\nproduce replicable results. Yet the last five to ten years have seen renewed emphasis on\nreforming schools and teaching practices to replace our educational production lines with\nclassrooms that teach people to think and solve problems. This current effort at renewal\nrevolves around a set of ideas and theories referred to as constructivism.\nCharacteristics of constructivism\nThe class of theories that guides the development of REALs is called constructivist\ntheories (Clement, 1982; Bransford and Vye, 1989; Minstrell, 1989; Resnick and Klopfer,\n1989; Schoenfeld, 1989; Bednar et al, 1991; Duffy and Bednar, 1991; Perkins, 1991;\nScardamalia and Bereiter, 1991; Spiro et al, 1991). Fundamentally, constructivism asserts\nthat we learn through a continual process of building, interpreting, and modifying our\nown representations of reality based upon our experiences with reality (Jonassen, 1994c).\n\u2014\nALT-] Volume 3 Number 2\nWheatley (1992) elaborates on the importance of this idea not just in learning but also in\nthe innovation and improvement of society:\nLearning (innovation) is fostered by information gathered from new connections; from\ninsights gained by journeys into other disciplines or places; from active, collegial networks and\nfluid, open boundaries. Learning (innovation) arises from ongoing circles of exchange where\ninformation is not just accumulated or stored, but created. Knowledge is generated anew from\nconnections that weren't there before. When this information self-organizes, learning\n(innovation) occurs, the progeny of information-rich, ambiguous environments, (p. 113)\nTTworetical\nfoundation\nCharacteristics of\nconstnjcuvum\nAttributes of REALs\nInstructloni\nttntegiMto\nsupport\nREALS\nConstruct! vbt view\nof teaming\nJ_\nActive knowiedfl*\nconstruction and\n\u2022volution\nmdixtd knowUdg*\nC S J\nStudtnt\nresponsibility\nindlnftl\u00abllY\u00ab\n6*n\u00abnttv*\nwsi IIUIU\nstrategics\nReciprocal\ntticning\nAuthentic\nU\u00abn*ig\ncontexts\nCognlttv*\nspprtntlcvstilp\nAuthentic\ntssigmmt\nstntigtes\ninstruction\nFigure I: REAL definition: Framework\nLttmingki\ndaslgn\nCollaboration and\nsocial negotiation\nofnteanlno\nCo-openttv*\nSuppOfT\nProolefli^wweo\nleamtno\nCognUv*\nfitxibilly\ntruory\nTo develop learning environments that encourage the type of learning described by\nJonassen, Wheatley, and others, REALs reflect the theories and philosophies of\nconstructivism. In fact, the three main characteristics of the constructivist view of learning\ngovern our design of REALs (see Figure 1). The first characteristic of constructivism is\nthe notion that knowledge is not a product to be accumulated but an active and evolving\nprocess in which the learner attempts to make sense out of the world (Gurney, 1989).\nBrown et al (1989) illustrate this idea:\nA concept, for example, will continually evolve with each new occasion of use, because new\nsituations, negotiations, and activities inevitably recast it in a new, more densely textured\nform. So a concept, like the meaning of a word, is always under construction, (p. 33)\n13\nR Scott Grobinger and Joanna C Dunlap Rich environments for active learning: a definition\nThe second characteristic is the notion that people conditionalize their knowledge in\npersonal ways (Gurney, 1989). That is, they acquire knowledge in forms that enable them\nto use that knowledge later. Bransford et al (1990) state that:\n[...] there are large differences between knowing something and spontaneously thinking to\ndo it or use it when one is engaged in an actual problem-solving situation, (p. 122)\nKnowledge, then, is 'indexed' to the contexts in which we encounter it. We are unlikely to\nuse knowledge that is decontextualized because we can see no relevance - no contextual\ncues cause us to remember that knowledge because it was taught without cues. A person\nwho indexes and conditionalizes knowledge knows when to apply that knowledge. A\nperson who learns in a decontextualized way often is not aware that he or she has the\napplicable knowledge to solve a problem. In other words, knowledge acquired is inert.\nStudents must acquire concepts and theories in ways that help them use the information\nlater on, and appreciate the value of that information. Brown et al (1989, p. 36) describe\nthis process as indexicalizing knowledge. They mean that rich involvement in realistic and\nrelevant problem-solving allows learners to develop many broad and deep indexicalized\nrepresentations that enable them to apply knowledge more spontaneously to new\nsituations because they can compare a known and relevant situation with a new situation.\nThe more links there are across related knowledge structures, the more likely students are\nto apply that knowledge. The more closely the learning context resembles the actual\ncontext, the better people will perform. Tulving and Thompson (1973) refer to this as\n'encoding specificity,' which holds that successful retrieval of information is enhanced\nwhen cues relevant to later retrieval of that information are encoded along with the\nmaterial learned. It is important to note that constructivists contend that these rich links\ncannot be developed in decontextualized learning activities; rather, learning must be\nplaced in realistic contexts that provide cognitive conflict or puzzlement, and determine\nthe organization and nature of what is learned (Savery and Duffy, 1994).\nWhite (see Robertson, 1990) theorizes that there are two kinds of links that need to be\ndeveloped while learning: internal and external. Internal associations are connections\namong the criterial attributes of a principle. Internal associations reflect the learner's\nunderstanding of the concept. External associations refer to connections between the\nprinciple and everyday experiences or context, and indicate the 'usability' of a concept.\nLearning to solve problems requires both kinds of links. Our schools are good at building\nthe internal links, but poor at providing the external links.\nThe third major characteristic of constructivism is the importance of collaboration and\nsocial negotiation of meaning. Learning happens within a social context. Conceptual\ngrowth comes from sharing our perspectives and testing our ideas with others, modifying\nour internal representations in response to that process of negotiation (Bednar et al,\n1991). Common understandings and shared meanings are developed through interaction\namong peers and teachers. This, is the cultural aspect of knowledge.\nThe activities of a domain are framed by its culture. Their meaning and purpose are\nsocially constructed through negotiations among present and past members. Activities\n. thus cohere in a way that is, in theory if not always in practice, accessible to members\nwho move within the social framework. These coherent, meaningful, and purposeful\n14\nALT-J Volume 3 Number 2\nactivities are authentic, according to the definition of the term we use here. (Brown et al,\n1989, p. 34)\nThis social aspect of constructivism is important on an individual level as well as cultural\nlevel, for collaborative interactions allow us to test the viability of our understandings,\ntheories, and conjectures (Savery and Duffy, 1994).\nREALs embody the characteristics of constructivism, but how? What are the critical\nattributes of REALs that support a constructivist view of learning? The next section of\nthis article discusses each of the criterial attributes of a REAL:\nA. Student responsibility and initiative.\nB. Generative learning activities.\nC. Authentic learning contexts.\nD. Authentic assessment strategies.\nE. Co-operative support.\nWe will illustrate each attribute with examples of functioning REALs utilizing the\nstrategies of reciprocal teaching, cognitive apprenticeship, anchored instruction, cognitive\nflexibility theory, learning in design, and problem-based learning (PBL).\nThe main attributes of REALs\nA. Student responsibility and initiative\nThe first attribute of REALs is that they are student-centred. Student-centred learning\nenvironments place a major emphasis on developing intentional learning and life-long\nlearning skills. These skills include the abilities to construct higher-order questions to\nguide learning, reflect on consequences and implications of actions, and monitor and\nmodify personal cognitive activity. This attribute is critical because students cannot\nactively construct and evolve their knowledge structures without taking responsibility and\ninitiative for their learning.\nIntentional learning\nScardamalia and her colleagues (1989) noticed that passive or immature learners have\ncertain characteristics that prevent them from becoming skilful problem solvers. First,\nimmature learners tend to organize their mental activities around topics rather than goals,\npromoting decontextualization and the inability to see the relevance of the learning\nactivity to their lives. Second, they tend to focus on surface features, and do not examine\na topic in depth. Third, they tend to work until a task is finished. They do not take time\nto examine the quality of their work, nor do they take the time to consider revisions to\ntheir finished product or to the strategies utilized to complete the task. When the task is\nfinished, they forget whatever learning took place during their work on the task. Finally,\nthey think of learning in an additive fashion rather than transforming and enriching their\nexisting knowledge structures.\nThese characteristics are, in essence, the product of the conventional kind of schooling\nthat we described earlier. These behaviours prevent students from transferring their\nis\nR Scott Grab\/nger and Joanna C Dun\/op Rich environments for active learning a definition\nknowledge to new problems because they have learned content and strategies in a\ndecontextualized context. Palincsar (1990) states that:\nTo achieve transfer it is necessary to attend to the context in which instruction and practice\noccur; transfer is likely to occur to the extent that there are common elements between the\nsituation in which the children are learning this tactic and the situations in which such a\ntactic would be useful, (p. 37)\nPalincsar, Scardamalia, and Bereiter are leading proponents of the conviction that\nstudents must be taught to take more responsibility for their own learning to enhance the\nlikelihood of transfer. They refer to this concept as intentional learning, or 'those\ncognitive processes that have learning as a goal rather than an accidental outcome'\n(Bereiter and Scardamalia, 1989, p. 363). Palincsar and Klenk (1992) state that\n'intentional learning, in contrast to incidental learning, is an achievement resulting from\nthe learner's purposeful, effortful, self-regulated, and active engagement'. To be\nintentional learners, students must learn to learn as well as accrue knowledge. Teaching,\ntoo, takes on a revised role, for to teach for intentional learning means to cultivate those\ngeneral abilities that facilitate life-long learning (Palincsar, 1990). The main skills\ninvolved in teaching students to be more intentional are questioning, self-reflection, and\nmetacognition, 'or the awareness and ability to monitor and control one's activity as a\nlearner' (Brown et al, 1983, p. 212).\nQuestioning\nScardamalia and Bereiter (1991) believe that one of the first steps in developing\nintentional learners is to help students take more executive control over what they decide\nto learn through the development of higher-order questioning skills. They point out that\nin a typical classroom, teachers ask all the questions. Therefore, teachers are the ones\nengaged in the question generation process, which involves important high-level thinking\nskills and executive control decisions - the skills students need to develop actively to\nconstruct and evolve their knowledge structures. The students are not given an\nopportunity to ask questions and, therefore, do not learn to perform the analysis activities\nrelated to question generation. Research by Scardamalia and Bereiter (1991) indicates\nthat students can learn to ask questions to guide their knowledge-building, thus assuming\na 'higher level of agency' and more ownership for their learning. In a student-centred\nREAL, students are given more executive control over their learning to enable them to\ntake more ownership, to find more relevance and authenticity, and to learn life-long\nlearning skills.\nSelf-Reflection\nA second skill in intentional learning is self-reflection. 'Self-reflection implies observing\nand putting an interpretation on one's own actions, for instance considering one's own\nintentions and motives as objects of thought' (Von Wright, 1992, p. 61). Von Wright\nwrites that self-reflection involves the abstraction of meaning and is an interpretative\nprocess aimed at the understanding of reality. To understand the world in different ways\ninvolves modifying our conceptions of the world and our place in the world. It involves\nthinking about reality in alternative ways. Von Wright goes on to describe two levels of\nreflection. One level of reflection is the ability to think about consequences and\nimplications of actions. A second level of reflection is the ability to think about oneself as\n\u2014 _ _\nALT-J Volume 3 Number 2\nan intentional subject of one's own actions and to consider the consequences and efficacy\nof those actions. This involves the ability to look at oneself in an objective way, and to\nconsider ways of changing future actions to improve performance. The second level of\nreflection also involves metacognitive learning skills.\nMetacognitive skills\n'Metacognitive skills refer to the steps that people take to regulate and modify the progress\nof their cognitive activity: to learn such skills is to acquire procedures which regulate\ncognitive processes' (Von Wright, 1992, p. 64). Metacognitive skills include taking\nconscious control of learning, planning and selecting strategies, monitoring the progress of\nlearning, correcting errors, analysing the effectiveness of learning strategies, and changing\nlearning behaviours and strategies when necessary (Ridley et al, 1992). These abilities\ninteract with developmental maturation and domain expertise. Immature learners have not\nacquired the ability to regulate or modify their cognitive activity; they may have learned a\nsingle strategy, such as memorization, and default to that one strategy in all situations. \u2022\nStudies show that the use of metacognitive strategies can improve learning skills, and that\nthe independent use of these metacognitive strategies can be gradually developed in\npeople (Brown, 1978; Biggs, 1985; Weinstein et al, 1988). Blakely and Spence (1990)\ndescribe several basic instructional strategies that can be incorporated into classroom\nactivities to help students develop metacognitive behaviours:\n\u2022 Students should be asked to identify consciously what they 'know' as opposed to what\nthey 'do not know'.\n\u2022 Students should keep journals or logs in which they reflect upon their learning\nprocesses, noting what works and what does not.\n\u2022 Students should manage their own time and resources, including estimating time\nrequired to complete tasks and activities, organizing materials and resources, and\nscheduling the procedures necessary to complete an activity.\n\u2022 Students must participate in guided self-evaluation using individual conferences and\nchecklists to help them focus on the thinking process.\nREAL strategy: reciprocal teaching\nOne of the manifestations of a REAL that emphasizes the development of intentional\nlearning skills described above is reciprocal teaching. The context of reciprocal teaching is\nsocial, interactive, and holistic. Palincsar and Klenk (1992) used reciprocal teaching with\nat-risk first-grade students to develop reading skills. Palincsar and Klenk (1992) describe\nreciprocal teaching as:\n[. . .] an instructional procedure that takes place in a collaborative learning group and\nfeatures guided practice in the flexible application of four concrete strategies to the task of\ntext comprehension: questioning, summarizing, clarifying, and predicting. The teacher and\ngroup of students take turns leading discussions regarding the content of the text they are\njointly attempting to understand, (p. 213)\nThese strategies are the kinds of intentional learning strategies that encourage self-\nregulation and self-monitoring behaviours.\n17\nR Scott Grabinger and Joanna C Dunlap Rich environments for active learning: a definition\nThe relationship of reciprocal teaching to REALs is founded on three theoretical\nprinciples, consistent with the characteristics of constructivism described previously,\nbased on the work of Vygotsky (1978) as described by Palincsar and Klenk (1992). The\nfirst principle states that the higher cognitive processes originate from social interactions.\nThe second principle is Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). Vygotsky\ndescribed the ZPD as:\n[. . .] the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent\nproblem-solving, and the level of potential development as determined through problem-\nsolving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers, (p. 86)\nReciprocal teaching is designed to provide a ZPD in which students, with the help of\nteachers and peers, take on greater responsibility for learning activities. Finally,\nVygotsky's third principle advocates that learning take place in a contextualized, holistic\nactivity that has relevance for the learners.\nHow, then, does reciprocal teaching work? The process begins with a text that a class\nreads silently, orally, or along with the teacher depending on the skill level of the students.\nFollowing each segment, a dialogue leader (students take turns) asks questions that deal\nwith content or 'wonderment' issues. The questions often stimulate further inquiry. The\nother students respond to the questions, raise their own questions, and, in cases of\ndisagreement or confusion, re-read the text. The discussion leader is responsible for\nsummarizing and synthesizing the reading and discussion, and clarifying the purpose of\nthe reading. The leader also generates and solicits predictions about the upcoming text to\nprepare for meaningful reading of the next segment. The teacher must model the\nappropriate behaviour and provide scaffolding to sustain the discussion. (The preceding\ndescription is taken from Palincsar and Klenk, 1992.) The students, then, are involved in\nthe higher-level thinking and decision-making activities that usually fall within the realm\nof the teacher. With the help of the teacher, students share a ZPD where they can learn\nthe questioning, summarizing, clarifying and predicting activities so integral to\nmetacognitive awareness.\nFinally, why does reciprocal teaching work? Collins et al (1991) posit the following\nreasons for its success (and, in a broader view, for the success of REALs):\n\u2022 The reciprocal teaching model engages students in activities that help them form a new\nconceptual model of the task of reading. They see reading as a process that involves\nreflection and prediction rather than just the recitation of words. They learn to make\nwhat they are reading relevant to their needs and to monitor their progress and strive\nfor clarification.\n\u2022 The teacher and student share a problem context while the teacher models expert\nstrategies that the students learn to use independently.\n\u2022 Scaffolding is crucial in the success of reciprocal teaching. 'Most importantly, it,\ndecomposes the task as necessary for the students to carry it out, thereby helping them\nto see how, in detail, to go about it' (Collins, et al, 1991, p. 11).\n\u2022 Finally, students learn the self-monitoring activities and thinking processes involved in\ncritiquing and improving their work.\n18\nALT-] Volume 3 Number 2\nB. Generative learning activities\nThe second requirement of REALs is that students engage in generative learning\nactivities. People who learn through active involvement and use tools build an\n'increasingly rich implicit understanding of the world' (Brown et al, 1989, p. 33).\nGenerative learning requires that students 'engage in argumentation and reflection as they\ntry to use and then refine their existing knowledge as they attempt to make sense of\nalternate points of view' (CTGV, 1993b, p. 16). Studies indicate that knowledge is more\nlikely to be active and used when acquired in a problem-solving mode rather than in a\nfactual-knowledge mode (Adams et al, 1988; Lockhart et al, 1988). The concept of\ngenerative learning is an extension of the constructivist characteristic of actively\nconstructing knowledge; students cannot construct or evolve their own learning without\ngenerating something through active involvement.\nGenerative learning requires a shift in the traditional roles of students and instructors.\nStudents become investigators, seekers, and problem solvers. Teachers become facilitators\nand guides, rather than presenters of knowledge. For example, rather than simply learning\nwhat objectives and goals are, students in a teacher-education class generate lesson plans and\nobjectives and then manipulate and revise them to solve new teaching problems. Ideally, they\ntest their objectives, goals, and strategies in actual practice-teaching situations. In generative\nlearning, students apply the information they learn. Generative learning activities require\nstudents to take static information and generate fluid, flexible, usable knowledge. Generative\nlearning, then, means that students are involved deeply and constantly with creating\nsolutions to authentic problems via the development and completion of projects. A REAL\nstrategy that relies heavily on projects is cognitive apprenticeship.\nREAL strategy: cognitive apprenticeship\nCognitive apprenticeship is modelled after the traditional apprenticeship way of learning\narts and crafts. It incorporates elements of traditional apprenticeship and modern\nschooling. In traditional apprenticeship, the processes of an activity are visible and\ninvolve learning a physical and outwardly observable activity (Collins et al, 1991). The\nexpert shows an apprentice how to perform a task, then watches and coaches as the\napprentice practises portions of the task, and finally turns over more and more\nresponsibility to the apprentice until the apprentice can perform the task alone (Collins et\nal, 1991). Traditional apprenticeship deals with processes that are easily visible because\nthey involve skills and produce visible products.\nThe goal of cognitive apprenticeship is to make processes that are normally invisible\nvisible. In schooling, the process of thinking is usually invisible to both students and\nteachers. For example, the practices of problem-solving, reading comprehension, and\ncomputation are not visible processes (Collins et al, 1991). Brown et al (1989) point out\nthat the term cognitive apprenticeship emphasizes that apprenticeship techniques can\nreach beyond observable physical skills to the kinds of cognitive skills associated with\nlearning in schools. In a cognitive apprenticeship environment, the teacher attempts to\nmake visible the thinking processes involved in performing a cognitive task. The teacher\nfirst models how to perform a cognitive task by thinking aloud. Then the teacher watches,\ncoaches, and provides scaffolding as the students practise portions of the task. Finally, he\nor she turns over more and more responsibility to students, and fades coaching and\n19\nR Scott Grabinger and Joanna C Ounlop Rich environments for active learning a definition\nscaffolding until they can perform the task alone. 'Cognitive apprenticeship supports\nlearning in a domain by enabling students to acquire, develop, and use cognitive tools in\nan authentic domain activity' (Brown et al, 1989, p. 39).\nThe differences between traditional and cognitive apprenticeship (Collins et al, 1991) are\nimportant because they indicate where the effort must be placed on the instructional\ndesign of learning activities. First, in traditional apprenticeship the task is easily\nobservable. In cognitive apprenticeship, the thinking processes must be deliberately\nbrought into the open by the teacher, and the teacher must help students learn to bring\ntheir thinking into the open. Second, in traditional apprenticeship, the tasks come from\nwork, and learning is situated in the workplace. In cognitive apprenticeship, the challenge\nis to situate the abstract goals of school curriculum in contexts that make sense to\nstudents. Third, in traditional apprenticeship, the skills learned are inherent in the task. In\nschooling, students learn skills that are supposed to transfer to different tasks. In\ncognitive apprenticeship, the challenge is to present a range of tasks to encourage\nreflection and to identify common transferable elements across tasks. The goal is to help\nstudents generalize and transfer their learning through conditionalized and indexed\nknowledge (related to the second characteristic of constructivism).\nCognitive apprenticeship and generative learning are closely linked because the process of\nmaking cognitive processes visible means that students must create or generate things that\nrepresent those processes. Teachers must create work and tasks that represent the process\nof solving a problem, writing, or computation in addition to products. To examine the\ndevelopment of student thinking, an English teacher may ask for questions, themes,\nconcept maps, and outlines before students begin writing. Mathematics teachers are often\nnotorious for telling students: 'I want to see your work, not just the answer,' so they can\nlook for errors in the thinking process.\nGenerative learning is one of the simplest features of a REAL. It simply demands that\nstudents produce something of value. It is probably the most exciting part of a REAL\nbecause students work on projects and tasks that are relevant to them and to their peers.\nIt keeps students busy and happy - or active - while helping them construct and evolve\ntheir knowledge structures.\nC. Authentic learning contexts\nThe third attribute of REALs is that learning takes place within an authentic context. An\nauthentic task, activity, or goal provide learning experiences as realistic as possible, taking\ninto consideration the age and maturation level of the students and environmental\nconstraints such as safety and resource availability.\nAn authentic context incorporates as much fidelity as possible to what students will\nencounter outside school in terms of tools, complexity, cognitive functioning, and\ninteractions with people (Williams and Dodge, 1992). Therefore, creating an authentic\nlearning context requires more than just presenting students with realistic problems or\nsituations - it also means that students must address the problems or situations\nrealistically as well (Honebein et al, 1993).\nAuthenticity is important to REALs for three reasons. First, realistic problems hold more\nrelevance to students' needs and experiences because they can relate what they are\n20\nAa-j Volume 3 Number 2\nlearning to problems and goals that they see every day. Therefore, it encourages students\nto take ownership of the situation and their own learning. Second, because the situations\nstudents encounter during learning are authentic and reflect the true nature of problems\nin the real world, it develops deeper and richer (indexicalized and conditioned) knowledge\nstructures, leading to a higher likelihood of transfer to novel situations. Finally, because\ncomplex problems require a team approach that provides natural opportunities for\nlearners to test and refine their ideas and to help each other understand the content, it\nencourages collaboration and negotiation.\nREAL strategy: anchored instruction\nOne of the ways to create authentic instruction in a REAL is to anchor that instruction in\na realistic event, problem, or theme (CTGV, 1990, 1992a, 1992b, 1993a, 1993d).\nAnchored instruction is fixed within a real-world event that is appealing and meaningful\nto students (Bransford et al, 1990) and involves complex contexts that require students to\nsolve interconnected sub-problems. Because students are encouraged to work together to\nsolve these complex problems, they are exposed to multiple perspectives in an\nenvironment that gives them an opportunity to test out their ideas, solutions, and\nprocesses (CTGV, 1992b).\nAt the heart of the model is an emphasis on the importance of creating an anchor or focus\nto generate interest, and to enable students to identify and solve problems and pay\nattention to their own perception and comprehension of these problems' (Bransford et al,\n1990, p. 123).\nIn anchored learning situations, students develop component skills and objectives in the\ncontext of meaningful, realistic problems and problem-solving activities. These complex\ncontexts are called 'macrocontexts' (Williams and Dodge, 1992, p. 373). Addressing a key\ncharacteristic of constructivism - indexed knowledge acquisition - the primary goal of\nanchored instruction (and REALs) is to overcome the problem of inert knowledge. For\nexample, students in an instructional design and development class work in teams with\nactual clients to develop instruction that will be delivered to another group of students.\nThey must define the problem, identify resources, set priorities, and explore alternative\nsolutions with the same skills and abilities that are required during realistic, outside-the-\nclassroom problem-solving and decision-making activities. This is in direct contrast to the\nway students develop component skills and objectives in a more conventional classroom\nenvironment by working simplified, compartmentalized, and decontextualized problems.\nSimply stated, it is the difference between providing meaningful, authentic learning\nactivities and 'I'm never going to use this' activities.\nAnchored instruction shares many features of programmes that are case-based and\nproblem-based (Barrows, 1985; Spiro et al, 1991; Williams and Dodge, 1992). The idea is\nto let learners experience the intellectual changes that experts feel when modifying their\nown understandings from working with realistic situations (CTGV, 1992b).\nEffective anchors are intrinsically interesting, fostering ownership, and helping students\nnotice the features of problem situations that make particular actions relevant (Bransford\net al, 1990). The CTGV (1991) uses the following design principles when creating\nanchored instruction. First, they use a video-based presentation format because of the\ndramatic power of the medium and because of the use of multiple modalities, realistic\n21\nR. Scott Grabinger and Joanna C Dunlap Rich environments for active learning a definition\nimagery, and omnipresence in our culture. Second they present a problem using actors\nand a narrative format for interest. Third, the problem solution requires a generative\nlearning format in which students must identify pertinent information in the fourth\nfeature, embedded data design. Fifth, the problem is complex, with the possibility of\nmultiple solutions, and requires a team approach. Sixth, they use pairs of similar\nproblems in different contexts to enrich the indexicalization of knowledge structures.\nFinally, they attempt to draw links across the curriculum to enhance the relevance of the\nproblem.\nOne of the CTGV's projects in anchored instruction is the Jasper Woodbury series\n(CTGV, 1992b). Jasper is a video-based series designed to promote problem-posing,\nproblem-solving, reasoning, and effective communication. Each of Jasper's adventures is\na 15- to 20-minute story in which the characters encounter a problem that the students in\nthe classroom must solve before they are allowed to see how the movie characters solved\nthe problem. The Jasper series helps students learn to break a problem into parts,\ngenerate sub-goals, find and identify relevant information, generate and test hypotheses,\nand co-operate with others.\nREAL strategy: cognitive flexibility theory\nCognitive Flexibility Theory (CFT) also addresses the need for authentic learning\ncontexts in order to help learners develop conditionalized and indexicalized knowledge\nstructures (Spiro et al, 1991; Jacobson and Spiro, 1992).'\nEssentially, the theory states that cognitive flexibility is needed in order to construct an\nensemble of conceptual and case representations necessary to understand a particular\nproblem-solving situation. The idea is that we cannot be said to have a full understanding\nof a domain unless we have the opportunity to see different case representations (Borsook\nand Higginbotham-Wheat, 1992, p. 63).\nCFT attempts to teach content in ill-structured domains, that is, in domains where the\nknowledge-base is so vast and complex that multiple solutions to problems are possible\nand likely. There are no clear-cut answers in ill-structured domains, so simple algorithms\noften fail. Ill-structured domains include law, medicine, and education. So, CFT\nemphasizes the following instructional strategies to help learners develop rich and deep\nknowledge structures (Jacobson, 1994):\n\u2022 CFT uses several cases and rich examples in their full complexity. One of the tenets of\nCFT is to avoid over-simplifying knowledge and examples because this leads to future\nmisunderstandings that are difficult to change.\n\u2022 CFT uses multiple forms of knowledge representation, providing examples in several\nkinds of media. CFT encourages students to look at knowledge in several ways and\nfrom several perspectives.\n\u2022 CFT links abstract concepts to case examples and brings out the generalizable\nconcepts and strategies applicable to other problems or cases.\n\u2022 To avoid the mistakes of over-simplification, CFT presents a number of examples to\nmake apparent, rather than hide, the variability of concepts and themes within the\ndomain.\n22\nAn-] Volume 3 Number 2\nAlthough authentic learning contexts help students to develop knowledge that can be\ntransferred and applied to new problems and situations, the fact that students are\nengaged in authentic activities creates some unique assessment problems. These issues will\nbe examined next.\nD. Authentic assessment strategies\nGoing hand in hand with the need to develop authentic learning contexts, the fourth\nREAL attribute is the use of authentic assessment strategies to evaluate student\nperformance. Conventional schooling relies on standardized and paper\/pencil tests to\nmeasure the quantity of knowledge that students have accrued. But traditional tests,\nwritten reports, and grading schemes are inappropriate measures (Frederiksen and\nCollins, 1989), time-consuming to administer and score (Williams and Dodge, 1992), and\npoor indicators of how students will perform in actual problem-solving conditions.\nWilliams and Dodge also state that students are often assessed on skills different from\nones that are taught, and experience problem-solving assessments that tend to be\nsubjective. Testing and assessment must recognize the importance of the organization of\nthe knowledge-base and its connectedness to contexts.\nWiggins (1989) contrasts authentic tests, which he describes as contextualized, complex\nintellectual challenges against multiple-choice measures that he describes as fragmented\nand static. According to Wiggins, authentic tests include the following criteria:\n\u2022 The intellectual design features of tests and evaluation tasks must emphasize realistic\ncomplexity, stress depth more than breadth, include ill-structured tasks or problems,\nand require students to contextualize content knowledge.\n\u2022 Standards of grading and scoring features should include complex multi-faceted\ncriteria that can be specified and that are reliable across multiple scorers. What\nconstitutes a high level of performance should be explainable to students and teachers\nbefore they take the test. Teachers often claim that criteria are subjective, but this is\nseldom the case; most criteria can be described with some thoughtful effort.\n\u2022 Tests and evaluations must be diverse, and must recognize the existence of multiple\nkinds of intelligences. In terms of fairness and equity, evaluations and assessments\nshould allow students to use their strengths within areas where their interests lie.\nREAL example: learning in design\nCarver et al (1992) elaborate on this theme by proposing an extensive list of behaviours\nneeded by students in a REAL. In their particular manifestation of a REAL, they\nconsider the classroom a design community in which students design instruction for other\nstudents, documentaries for local media, and other exhibits for the community. Their\nprogram has the same goals of high-level thinking, reflection, and transfer as the other\nREAL strategies described:\nThe instructional virtues of these design experiences include the opportunity to develop and\ncoordinate a variety of complex mental skills, such as decomposing a topic into subtopics,\ngathering data from a variety of sources, organizing diverse and often contradictory\ninformation, formulating a point of view, translating ideas into a presentation targeted at a\nparticular audience, evaluating the design, and making revisions based on the evaluations.\n(Carver ef a\/, 1992, p. 386)\n23\nR. Scott Grabinger and Joanna C Dunlap Rich environments for active learning: a definition\nAgain, there are several parallels with the other examples that we have discussed. Their\nREAL focuses on complex mental skills; analysing, comparing, and manipulating\ninformation; working on authentic, community-based tasks; and working with others.\nTo evaluate fairly students working in this environment, teachers need a clear specification\nof the skills students need for design tasks and prescriptions for how teachers can effectively\nsupport those skills (see also Agnew et al, 1992). Specification of skills and prescriptions of\nsupport are two parts of assessment that must be linked for fair assessment. If a skill cannot\nbe supported by the teacher or some kind of scaffolding technique, then it cannot be fairly\nevaluated. It may, in fact, be outside the ZPD (Zone of Proximal Development) and beyond\nthe current capability of the student. One of the teacher's jobs in a REAL is to specify skills\nand performances that can be supported so the student can grow in ability. Carver et al\n(1992) break the important behaviours for their environment into:\n\u2022 project-management skills, including creating a timeline, allocating resources, and\nassigning team roles;\n\u2022 research skills, including determining the nature of the problem, posing questions,\nsearching for information, developing new information, and analysing and interpreting\ninformation;\n\u2022 organization and representation skills, including choosing the organization and\nstructure of information, developing representations (text, audio, and graphics),\narranging structure and sequence; and juggling constraints;\n\u2022 presentation skills, including transferring their design into media and arousing and\nmaintaining audience interest; and\n\u2022 reflection skills, including evaluating the process and revising the design.\nTheir criteria work for their learning environment. Other models may need to revise some\nof the specifics, though the five main categories provide an excellent starting place in\nspecifying skills targeted for assessment in authentic assessments. Goldman, Pellegrino,\nand Bransford's (1994) discussion of assessment in the CTGV Jasper series suggests the\nfollowing assessment areas: assessment of complex mathematical problem-solving\n(mathematics is the content domain of Jasper), measures of group problem-solving\nperformance, assessment of extensions into other areas of the content area, and\nassessment of cross-curricular extensions. Although conducting an assessment for a\nREAL is more work than conventional assessment, it is also an integral part of the\nlearning process rather than a periodic quantifiable measure. Authentic assessment\nprovides feedback and information that is useful for planning future learning activities.\nAssessment in REALs means that we have to consider more varied techniques. Neuman\n(1993), in her work with the Perseus hypermedia program, suggests several alternatives.\nFirst, she suggests that teachers use more observations including evaluator observations\nof performance processes, think-alouds by students, and automatic transaction\nmonitoring. Second, she suggests using interviews of students, instructors, and staff using\nboth questionnaires and focus groups. Finally, she suggests using document and product\nanalysis including assignments, syllabi, essays, journals, paths, reports, documentation,\nand presentations.\n24\nALT-J Volume 3 Number 2\nE. Co-operative support\nThe fifth and final characteristic of REALs, and one that is an important feature of\nalmost all the other REAL strategies described above, acknowledges the transactional\nnature of knowledge and suggests that a shift be made to focus on social practice,\nmeaning, and patterns (Roth, 1990). 'All cooperative learning methods share the idea that\nstudents work together to learn and are responsible for one another's learning as well as\ntheir own' (Slavin, 1991, p. 73). Working in peer groups helps students refine their\nknowledge through argumentation, structured controversy, and the sharing and testing of\nideas and perspectives. Additionally, students are more willing to take on the extra risk\nrequired to tackle complex, ill-structured, authentic problems when they have the support\nof others in the co-operative group. Co-operative learning and problem-solving groups\nalso address students' needs for scaffolding during unfamiliar learning and problem-\nsolving activities; therefore, with the support of others in the group, students are more\nlikely to achieve goals they may not have been able to meet on their own.\nConstructivists argue that co-operative learning and problem-solving groups facilitate\ngenerative learning. Some of the generative activities that students engage in co-operative\ngroups include (Brown et al, 1989):\n\u2022 Collective problem-solving. Groups give rise synergistically to insights and solutions\nthat would not come about individually.\n\u2022 Displaying multiple roles. Group participation means that the members must under-\nstand many different roles. They also may play different roles within the group to gain\nadditional insights.\n\u2022 Confronting ineffective strategies and misconceptions. Teachers do not have enough\ntime to hear what students are thinking or how they are thinking. Groups draw out,\nconfront, and discuss both misconceptions and ineffective strategies.\n\u2022 Providing collaborative work skills. Students learn to work together in a give-and-take\ninteraction rather than just dividing the workload.\nResearch indicates that co-operative learning, when implemented properly, is highly\nsuccessful. Slavin (1991) provides the following four summary statements regarding\nresearch findings in co-operative learning:\n\u2022 Successful co-operative-learning strategies always incorporate the two key elements of\ngroup goals and individual accountability.\n\u2022 When both group goals and individual accountability are used, achievement effects are\nconsistently positive. Slavin's review found that 37 of 44 experimental\/control\ncomparisons of at least four weeks' duration found significantly positive effects for co-\noperative group methods with none favouring traditional methods.\n\u2022 Positive achievement effects are present to about the same degree across all US grade\nlevels (2-12), in all major subjects, and in urban, rural, and suburban schools. Effects\nare equally positive for high, average, and low achievers.\n\u2022 Positive effects of co-operative learning are consistently found on such diverse\n25\nR. Scott Grabinger and Joanna C Dunlap Rich environments for active learning: a definition\noutcomes as self-esteem, inter-group relations, acceptance of academically handi-\ncapped students, attitudes toward school, and ability to work co-operatively.\nREAL strategy: problem-based learning\nProblem-based learning (PBL) embodies the definition of a rich environment for active\nlearning, and incorporates all attributes previously described. PBL is 'the learning that\nresults from the process of working toward the understanding or resolution of a problem'\n(Barrows and Tamblyn, 1980, p. 18). PBL found initial acceptance in the medical field,\nand has grown to become a major learning system for a number of medical, law, and\nbusiness schools. It is also being adapted for use in secondary schools and corporate\ntraining environments (Dunlap, 1995). PBL reflects the REAL attribute that knowledge is\nconstructed rather than received, for it is based on the assumption that knowledge arises\nfrom work with an authentic problem (Coltrane, 1993). Benor (1984) states that:\nProblem-based learning in the context of medical education means self-directed study by of\n[sic] learners who seek out information pertinent to either a real-life or a simulated\nproblem. The students have to understand the problem to the extent that its constituents\ncan be identified and defined. The learners have then to collect, integrate, synthesize and\napply this information to the given problem, using strategies that will yield a solution, (p.\n49)\nHow does PBL work? Savery and Duffy (1994) describe four characteristics of PBL.\nFirst, PBL environments include the learning goals of realistic problem-solving\nbehaviour, self-directed learning, content knowledge acquisition, and the development of\nmetacognitive skills.\nSecond, Savery and Duffy state that PBLs are based on problems that are generated\nbecause they raise relevant concepts and principles that are authentic. Problems must be\nauthentic because it is difficult to create artificial problems that maintain the complexity\nand dimensions of actual problems. Recall that we encountered the need for complexity\nin the REAL strategies of anchored instruction and cognitive flexibility theory. Realistic\nproblems also have a motivational effect. They tend to engage learners more because they\nwant to know the outcome of the problem. When the learning context is similar to the\nsituation in which the learning is to be applied, learning transfer is more likely to occur.\nTherefore, we see the continual reference to the necessity for transfer in PBL.\nThird, the actual presentation of the problem is a critical component of PBLs. Problems\nare encountered before any preparation or study has occurred (Barrows, 1980). The\nproblem must be presented in a realistic way that encourages students to adopt and take\nownership for the problem (Barrows and Tamblyn, 1980; Savery and Duffy, 1994). Work\non the problem begins with activating prior knowledge to enable students to understand\nthe structure of the new information. Learners state what they already know about the\nproblem domain. They use that knowledge to form hypotheses or ideas about potential\nsolutions. We also see this principle emphasized in intentional learning, because students\nmust ask themselves what they know about a subject before creating learning plans. The\ndata must be embedded in the problem presentation (refer back to the example of\nanchored instruction) but must not highlight the critical factors in the case. Students must\n26\nALT-) Volume 3 Number 2\nmake their own decisions about what is critical because that is cognitively authentic - it\nreflects actual job performance (Savery and Duffy, 1994).\nFourth, the facilitator has a crucial role comparable to the roles described in anchored\ninstruction and reciprocal teaching. The facilitator interacts with the students at a\nmetacognitive level, helping them ask the right questions and monitor their own progress.\nFacilitators avoid expressing opinion, giving information, or leading to a correct answer.\nTheir role is to challenge the students, and help them reflect on what they are learning.\n(Savery and Duffy, 1994).\nCo-operative learning is a critical component of PBL for it is used from the beginning to\nthe end of the problem-solution process. Members of the group listen to the problem\npresentation together. They analyse the problem's components, recall what they know,\nhypothesize, consider possible resources, and choose directions to go. They test and help\neach other. They work together on the solutions and reach consensus on final actions.\nThe entire process from beginning to end is co-operative. Co-operative learning is also\nused for its motivational factors.\nProblem discussion also increases motivation by gaining and maintaining student interest\n(attention), by relating the learning to student needs or helping students to meet personal\ngoals (relevance), by providing conditions conducive to student success (confidence), and\nthrough the motivation provided by that mastery of the task(s) (satisfaction) (Coltrane,\n1993, pp. 12-13).\nPBL is the epitome of the REAL constructive learning process. Students work with\nproblems in a manner that fosters reasoning and knowledge application appropriate to\ntheir levels of learning. In the process of working on the problem and with their peers,\nstudents identify areas of learning to guide their own individualized study. The skills and\nknowledge acquired by this study are applied back to the problem to evaluate the\neffectiveness of learning and to reinforce learning. The learning that has occurred in work\nwith the problem and in individualized study is summarized and integrated into the\nstudent's existing knowledge structure.\nConclusion\nTimes have changed. People now need to be able to think flexibly and-creatively, solve\nproblems, and make decisions within complex, ill-structured environments. Given these\nchanges, our assumptions on learning and education are out-dated, forcing us to modify\nour assumptions based on current theoretical views of learning. These new assumptions,\nsupported by the theories and philosophies of constructivism, require different\ninstructional methods, techniques, and strategies than have been conventionally used in\nclassroom settings. Reflecting a constructivist view of learning, REALs provide a way for\nus to address these new assumptions in order to meet the educational demands of a\nchanging society.\nWe have looked at each of the five main attributes of REALs that support the goals of\nconstructivism: (1) student responsibility and initiative, (2) generative learning activities,\n(3) authentic learning contexts, (4) authentic assessment strategies, and (5) co-operative\nsupport. Each REAL attribute builds upon and uses the others. None of the attributes are\n27\nR Scott Grabinger and Joanna C Dunlap Rich environments for active learning: a definition\nmutually exclusive, and no one attribute is more important than another; you cannot\nimplement one feature without incorporating the others to some degree. In effect, the\nattributes of REALs mirror the comprehensive, integrated, and holistic nature of REALs.\nThe characteristics are symbiotic, with one feature both supporting and needing the\nothers to create a successful rich environment for active learning.\nReferences\nAdams, L., Kasserman, J., Yearwood, A., Perfetto, G., Bransford, J. and Franks, J.\n(1988), 'The effects of facts versus problem-oriented acquisition', Memory and Cognition,\n16, 167-75.\nAgnew, P., Kellerman, A., and Meyer, J.
