This paper focuses on two key questions: what are the barriers to \nresearch utilisation and what are the most effective strategies for facilitating the use of \nresearch by managers in the public sector, based on research evidence?   The approach \nentailed extensive searches of on-line databases in the fields of management, education \nand medicine, from the UK United States (US), Canada, Australia and Europe.   Key \nthemes to emerge from this review were the accessibility and relevance of research, trust \nand credibility; the gap between researchers and users, and organisational factors.  \nResearch use can be facilitated through: support and training; collaboration and \npartnership; dissemination strategies; networks; and strong, visible leadership. \n152 words \nKeywords: \nDissemination \nResearch utilisation \/ utilization \nUse of research \nResearch use \nPublic sector research \n 1\nHemsley-Brown, J.V.

Managers frequently claim that their personal experience is more meaningful than \nthe results of research (Shkedi, 1998), but personal experience can be misleading (Davies \nand Nutley, 1999) and sustainable competitive advantage depends less on who has the \ninformation and increasingly on who is able to make the best use of that information \n(Moorman et al., 1992).  In addition, for many management researchers, it is important \nthat the knowledge they create is utilised and has some impact on managerial practice \n(Tranfield & Starkey, 1998). One of the goals of research is to generate new knowledge \nand establish an evidence-base within the profession.  Research may not solve problems \nor make decisions, but research can provide information for managers to use to reduce \nrisk in the decision-making process (Oulton, 1995).  \n \nIn a review of the literature Kelemen and Bansal, (2002) suggest that: management \nresearch fails to communicate with practitioners and may not reach sufficiently wide \naudiences.  Others have claimed that actions by decision-makers are insufficiently \ninformed by research, and dissemination is viewed as problematic (Hillage et al. 1998).  \nIt has also been suggested that insufficient value is placed on research evidence owing to \n 2\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \nconcerns about the relevance, accessibility and the timeliness of research outputs \n(Hemsley-Brown and Sharp, 2003) and that frequently organisational settings fail to \nsupport a culture which values and supports the use of research (Funk et al., 1991; 1995; \nLouis, 1996).  However, some have argued that there is no simple, direct line between \nknowledge production and utilization (Louis, 1992; 1996) and highlighted \u201cthe \ninadequacies of conceiving the relationship between research and practice as a linear \nrelationship\u201d and presented the relationships as a \u201cmulti-layered, unpredictable, \ninteracting process of engagement\u201d (DETYA, 2000 p.10) between the researcher and the \nuser.  \n \nBackground and context of research in management \nUnderstanding the factors affecting the utilisation of research by managers and decision-\nmakers in industry and the business sector has been the focus of considerable research:  \npioneer studies in the 1970s concluded that potential users of research were unable to \nevaluate the key features affecting research quality (Hanjoon and Chankon, 1994).  Early \nresearch identified a range of factors affecting the use of research for managerial \ndecision-making (Weiss and Bucuvalas, 1980; Deshpande and Saltman, 1982; Moorman \net al., 1992), and argued that research was used more often when the findings matched \nmanagers\u2019 expectations (Deshpande and Zaltman, 1982; 1984; 1987).  Research use was \nfound to be influenced by organisational factors such as the relationship between \nresearchers and managers (Zaltman and Moorman, 1988; Moorman et al., 1992) and the \nstructure of the organisation (Deshpande and Zaltman, 1982; 1984; 1987).   \n \n 3\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \nMore recently, Tranfield, et al., (2003 p.212) have argued that \u2018management research is a \nrelatively young field, far less well developed in terms of agenda and question \nformulation than much of medical science\u2019.  In view of this, many researchers have \nsought to identify the most effective strategies for facilitating research utilisation by \nconducting cross-sector reviews and comparative studies, with the intention of learning \nfrom other professions where research utilisation is more well established (e.g. Hemsley-\nBrown and Sharp, 2002; 2003; Walter et al., 2003a; 2003b).   For example, Davies and \nNutley (1999 p.15) found that \u201cevidence on effectiveness is more to the fore in healthcare \nthan in any other public sector service\u201d and they concluded that by sharing experience \nacross diverse sectors important insights and advances in research utilisation could be \nmade.   \n \nThis paper examines issues that emerged from a cross-sector review of the literature \nwhich focused on two key questions: what are the barriers to research utilisation and what \nrecommendations have been made by researchers to indicate the ways these barriers \ncould be addressed?   Secondly, what were the most effective strategies for facilitating \nthe use of research by managers, based on research evidence?  Barriers to research use \nare categorised under the following themes: the accessibility and relevance of research, \ntrust and credibility; the gap between researchers and users, and organisational factors.    \nFacilitating the use of research by managers through dissemination strategies is discussed \nin the context of: collaboration, partnerships and links; communication networks, \ncommunities of practice and leadership.    \n \n 4\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \n \n \nThe focus and design of the study \nTo ensure that the focus of the literature review was clear, the author defined the terms \nused in the research questions.   In the broadest sense, \u2018research\u2019 was defined as \u201can \noriginal investigation undertaken in order to gain knowledge and understanding\u201d \n(HEFCE, 1999 p.261), or as \u201csystematic enquiry made public\u201d (Stenhouse, 1987 p.74).  \nThe idea that research can make a major contribution to improving the practice of \nmanagement is based on the assumption that research is \u201csystematic and rigorous, and \nprovides explicit evidence, which can be assessed objectively\u201d (Hammersley, 2001 p.2.   \nIn the context of this study, the focus of the literature searches was on examining issues \nrelated to research use by managers i.e. those who are involved in strategic decision-\nmaking and\/or a role as a team leader in: education, healthcare or the business sector.  \nThe review also included findings from studies of practitioners (teachers, healthcare \nprofessionals or administrators) when the findings were specifically pertinent to the \nreview\u2019s research questions for example, a focus on the role of managers in facilitating \nresearch use by practitioners.       \n \nThe approach entailed extensive searches of management, education and medical on-line \ndatabases, namely: AEI; Business Source Premier; BEI; BOPCAS; CERUK database; \nERIC; Ingenta; PSYCINFO; MedLine; and Web of Science.   The reviewer included \npublished journal papers and conference papers from the UK and other countries, \nincluding the United States (US), Canada, Australia and Europe, written in English.   \n 5\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \nTheses and unpublished papers were excluded.  Each piece of empirical research was \nsubjected to a thorough review, using a standard framework to extract key information \nabout the purpose, design, sample, methodology, findings and implications of the study.  \nCriteria used to determine the selection of research included: the pertinence of the \nresearch to the review; the appropriateness of the study design to address the review \nquestions; the quality of the research in terms of its design, conduct and reporting; and \nthe reviewer\u2019s judgement of the validity, reliability and generalisability of the findings.  \nThe searches resulted in 150 papers (empirical, theoretical and opinion papers) being \nselected for further scrutiny from over 5,000 citations. \n \nAddressing the barriers to research utilisation \nThe notion of \u201cbarriers\u201d to research use is well established in all sectors.  The \u201cBarriers \nScale\u201d (Funk et al., 1991; 1995) consisting of 29 factors affecting the utilisation of \nresearch evidence in healthcare, has been used with a wide range of managers, \npractitioners and administrators from several countries (Funk et al., 1991; 1995; Dunn et \nal., 1998; Parahoo, 2000; Retsas, 2000).   Analysis of the literature and categorisation of \nthe barriers to research utilisation resulted in the emergence of a number of key themes, \nwhich are explored the following sections.  \n \nThe inaccessibility of research \nKelemen and Bansal (2002) speculated that because in their view management research is \nwritten in a style that is alienating to most practitioners, and is published only in \nacademic, rather than practitioner journals, this has had a serious impact on research use \n 6\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \nby managers in the business sector.   Walter et al., (2003a; 2003b) also recommended that \nto address the issue of inaccessibility research should to be translated for users. However, \nthey acknowledged that \u201csimply presenting findings in different formats appears unlikely \nto change behaviour\u201d (Walter et al., 2003b p.13).     \n \nA number of research studies, both in health care and education, have concluded that lack \nof access was a key factor in research use (Champion and Leach, 1989; Elliott  and \nSarland,  1995; Moore, 1995; Haug,  1997; Davies, 1999; Goldstein and Woodhouse, \n2000).  In the health care sector, for example evidence from a meta-analysis (Haug, 1997) \nindicated that physicians appeared to choose the sources of information that were most \neasily accessible and most applicable to the problem, and they frequently relied on \nindirect sources of information about research findings, such as discussions with \ncolleagues, described by Wenger (1998) as \u2018communities of practice\u2019 (Wenger et al., \n2002 p.4).       The volume, applicability and ambiguity of research material have also \nbeen identified as key barriers to research use by those in education (Castle, 1988; \nCousins and Leithwood, 1993; Shkedi, 1998), where the inaccessibility to journals is both \nphysical and intellectual; and practitioners claimed there was a lack of time and support \nto help potential users to access research.    \n \nThe relevance of the research \nTranfield and Starkey (1998) argued that a key goal of management research is to \nimprove the relationship between theory and practice, but they highlighted a numbers of \nconcerns including the issue of the relevance and the application of findings from \n 7\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \nmanagement research.  Once information had become available to the manager, it was \nlikely to be assessed on the basis of prior experience for its relevance and consistency \nwith expectations (Deshpande and Zaltman, 1987; Hemsley-Brown and Sharp, 2003).  \nAuthors from all sectors highlighted the importance of the \u201crelevance\u201d of research \n(Deshpande and Zaltman, 1984; Castle, 1988; Zaltman, and Moorman, 1989; Beard and \nWilliams, 1992; Cousins and Leithwood, 1993; Saha et al., 1995; McArthur, 1996; \nOrdonez and Maclean, 1997; Tranfield and Starkey 1998; Brooker, and Macpherson, \n1999; Bryant,  2000; Edwards, 2000; Parahoo, 2000) and suggested that researchers \nshould: ensure that topics are of interest to decision-makers; specify the implications; and \nbe precise and realistic about claims (Ordonez and Maclean, 1997).  Research impact in \nthe business sector seemed to be affected by how finely tuned it was to meeting \nmanagers\u2019 needs and inconsistent or counterintuitive informaton was less likely to be \nused (Deshpande and Zaltman, 1987).  \n \nTrust and mistrust of the research design \nAcademic papers in the education and the business sectors, have raised concern about the \nquality and design of research studies (Deshpande and Zaltman, 1987; Bracey, 1989; \nReed and Franks, 1989; Dobby, 1999; Davies, 2000; Davies and Nutley, 2002).  The \nusefulness of research in management was thought to be strongly influenced by features \nof research design (Hanjoon and Chankon, 1994).  Empirical studies have also shown \nthat trust and perceived quality of interaction contributed to research utilisation, with trust \nhaving indirect effects (Moorman et al., 1992).  For example, Hanjoon and Chankon, \n(1994) explored marketing managers\u2019 and researchers\u2019 perceptions regarding the \n 8\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \nevaluation of research quality.   They suggested that effective understanding of marketing \nresearch could be enhanced by mutual understanding between managers and researchers \nand by an increase in managers\u2019 trust of the research provider (Hanjoon and Chankon, \n1994).  \n  \nIn the education sector authors have suggested that lack of trust between researchers and \nusers can be a barrier to research utilisation (Slavin, 1990; Boostrom et al., 1993) and \nfindings from empirical research confirmed that users often lacked the statistical skills to \nunderstand the findings (Shkedi, 1998).  Slavin (1990) recommended that a more \nrigorous evaluation of research was needed and a wider range of research approaches \nshould be supported.   \n \nA cross sector review of literature by Walter et al., (2003b) included papers which \nstudied research impact on populations of:  practitioners, service managers, policy-\nmakers (at any level), and clients or service users.   They concluded that \u2018credibility\u2019 is \nimportant, and impact is enhanced where there is: strong evidence; endorsement from \nopinion leaders; and a high level of commitment from researchers and potential users.  \nFor example, evidence from the review suggests that provision of targeted materials can \nraise awareness of research findings, and that seminars and workshops involving \nresearchers and users can encourage more direct use of research evidence, and increase \ncredibility and trust in the findings.  \n 9\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \n \nOrganisational factors \nIn the private and public sector research evidence suggested that organisational factors \naffected research utilisation (Deshpande and Zaltman, 1982; Macguire, 1990; \nHammersley and Scarth, 1993; Latham, 1993; Cowan, 1994; Lacey, 1994; Rodgers, \n1994; Le May et al., 1998; Tooley, and Darby, 1998; Hundley, et al.,  2000; Rodgers, \n2000; Sebba, 2000; Hemsley-Brown and Sharp, 2003).   Factors identified as important \nwere organisational structure, actionability, and researcher-manager interaction \n(Deshpande and Zaltman, 1982); autonomy, empowerment, and organisational culture \n(Rogers, 1994).  \nThe most important variables affecting the use of research in the business sector were \nidentified by Deshpande and Zaltman (1982) as organisational structure (which they \ndefined as formalisation and centralisation); the technical quality of the research, the \nelement of \u201csurprise\u201d, actionability and the interaction between researchers and \nmanagers.  They argued that the degree of centralisation and formalisation within the \norganisation \u2013 or lack of these, seemed to be more important than other factors.  They \nclaimed that the more decentralised and less formalised firms were the more like they \nwere to make use of research findings (Deshpande and Zaltman, 1982 p.24).  Thus, a \nhighly centralised organisation \u201cmay have difficulty in implementing results from \nresearch, and may wish to decentralise decision-making at least during the \nimplementation phase\u201d (Deshpande and Zaltman, 1982 p.26).   Senge, (1990, cited by \nLouis, 1996)  found that organizations that were more effective in using knowledge \ntended to have denser internal communication networks, and more individuals served in \n 10\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \nboundary spanning roles where they legitimately brought in new ideas from the outside.   \nConversely, he claimed that organizations that failed to learn, even from information that \nthey requested, were characterized by internal boundaries, competition, excessive \nindividual entrepreneurship and lack of continuity in personnel.   \n \nIn the healthcare sector, both in the UK and the US (Dunn et al., 1998), the major barriers \nwhich emerged from empirical research were those associated with the organisational \nsetting: insufficient time to implement new ideas; lack of co-operation from senior \ncolleagues; inadequate facilities to support implementation; and lack of time to read \nresearch (Dunn et al., 1998) \u2013 the latter was also identified as a barrier to research use in \neducation (Hemsley-Brown and Sharp, 2002; Wilson et al., 2003).  Findings based on \ncase studies of eight local authorities in England and Wales, indicated that \u201cthe primary \nbarrier\u201d for managers in education \u201cwas lack of time\u201d (Wilson, et al., 2003 p.vi).  This \nfinding supports work by Latham (1993), who compared the reading habits of 20 \nprofessionals from each of four disciplines: education, engineering, law and medicine.  \nResults suggested that educators made little use of professional literature compared with \nother professionals. Educators claimed that there was too little time, the language of \nresearch was too technical, and literature in education is not regarded as potentially \nhelpful \n \nFindings from a cross sector review (Walter et al., 2003b p.30) suggested that in order to \nsupport and maintain research impact \u201cactivities need to be integrated within \norganisational systems and activities.  All key stakeholders need to be involved\u201d.   \n 11\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \nManagers needed information at the top and in the absence of good research information \nat the top of the hierarchy, organizations lacked departmental integration and were likely \nto be pursuing incongruent goals (Cowan, 1994).   Evidence from a number of authors \nsuggested that organisations therefore needed to: first, value research, in order to sustain \na culture of evidence-based practice (Davies et al., 2002; Nutley et al., 2002a; Davies and \nNutley, 2002); second, increase the critical mass of research-aware staff (Hundley et al.,  \n2000; Wilson et al., 2003) and finally, learn to recognise research use as part of the \norganisation\u2019s knowledge creation process (Mahajan and Wind, 1999).    \n \nThe gap between researchers and practitioners \nManagers and researchers in the private sector tended to differ widely on the factors they \nbelieved to be most important in making research \u201cuseful\u201d (Deshpande, and Zaltman, \n1984) and Kelemen and Bansal (2002) argued that the interests of management-\nresearchers often differed from those of management-practioners.  Le May et al., (1998) \nconcluded that managers and researchers in healthcare held differing perceptions \nregarding the nature of research, its role, and the opportunities and constraints affecting \ndissemination.  In education too there seemed to be a tension between users of research \nand researchers, which has been attributed to differences in their professional goals \n(DETYA, 2000).   Users were identified as seeking new solutions to operational matters \nwhilst researchers were characterised as seeking new knowledge (DETYA, 2000).  \nDeshpande and Zaltman, (1982 p.15) concluded that \u201cresearchers were from a basically \ndifferent culture or community than the consumers or users of knowledge\u201d.    Managers \nin the private sector seemed to be concerned with the usefulness of research findings for \n 12\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \ntheir organisations, while researchers seemed be more concerned with methodological \nissues of research (Burrell and Morgan, 1979; Shrivastava and Mitroff, 1984).   This \ndifference in orientation may \u201ccreate differences in the way managers and researchers \nevaluate the quality of research\u201d (Hanjoon and Chankon, 1994 p.273).  Research in the \nbusiness sector (Deshpande and Zaltman, 1982) also suggested that the gap between \nresearchers and user-managers could also be widened when the findings come as a \nsurprise to users \u2013 that is, the results did not match their experience or expectations.   \n \nMore recently cross sector reviews (Hemsley-Brown and Sharp, 2003; Walter et al., \n2003b) and research in education have focused on the gap between researchers and users \n(Boostrom et al., 1993; Mitchell and Boyd 1998; Shkedi, 1998; Kirst, 2000; Staller and \nKirk, 1998; Huberman, 1990; 1993).  For example, Huberman\u2019s (1990) Education et Vie \nActive (EVA) research programme with the Swiss National Research Council, studied the \ninteraction between researchers and users on a national vocational education research \nprogramme to establish, how and whether this interaction impacted on the effective \ndissemination of research findings.   \n \nHuberman (1990) used maps and charts to explain that good links, in type and amount, \nprior to a research study, and during a study, had contributed towards more energetic \napproaches to dissemination of the findings.  He focused on the role of reciprocally \ninfluential relationships in the process of knowledge utilization and identified five levels \nof linkage, which he defined as (from the weakest to the strongest): \u201chello-goodbye\u201d, \n\u201ctwo planets\u201d, \u201cstand-off\u201d, \u201creciprocal engagement\u201d, and \u201csynergy\u201d.

Huberman\u2019s research, therefore, \nprovided some empirical evidence to support the notion that the impact of research can be \nincreased through the strengthening of links between researchers and users at every stage \nof the research process. \n \nFacilitating research utilisation \nThe need to develop management strategies to facilitate research use has been put \nforward by a number of authors (Louis, et al., 1985; Hemsley-Brown, et al., 2002; \nWalter, et al., 2003a 2003b; Wilson et al., 2003).  However, there was little empirical \nresearch evidence to indicate which strategies were effective in increasing research use \nby managers, or practitioners.  The conclusions from a cross sector review indicated that \n\u201ccurrent knowledge on what makes for effective research impact is imperfect in nature \nand extent\u201d (Walter, et al., 2003b p.29).  The key themes to emerge from the current \nreview were that research use seems to be facilitated through: provision of support and \ntraining; collaboration, partnership and links; dissemination strategies; communication \nnetworks; and leadership.  Each of these factors is examined more closely in the \nfollowing sub-sections.   \n \n 14\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \nThe provision of support and training \nWalter et al., (2003b p.17) concluded that support for managers and practitioners to \u201ctry \nout\u201d research findings and to conduct their own research especially with the support of \n\u201cboth peer and expert opinion leaders\u201d, had improved research impact.  Wilson et al., \n(2003 p.15) on the other hand, found that successful strategies for facilitating access to \nresearch findings for managers and practitioners in education included: \u201corganising \nconferences, inviting national speakers\u201d; providing training; and creating opportunities \nfor sharing research.   \n \nResearch in the healthcare sector particularly, had focused on the need for practitioners to \ngain support and encouragement from managers (Armitage, 1990; Funk et al., 1991; \n1995; Camiah, 1997; Dunn et al., 1998; Kajermo et al, 2000; Parahoo, 2000).  For \nexample, Dunn et al., 1998 claimed that bringing about change through greater research \nuse was most effective when it was collaborative, and required management support to \ndevelop self-confidence. \n \nAuthors of discussion papers and researchers in education and healthcare have argued \nthat continuing professional development can change attitudes, develop skills, and \nincrease self-confidence in research use, as well as change practice (Anders and \nRichardson, 1991; Vulliamy and Webb, 1992; Adams, 1993; Duncan, 1993; Barta, 1995; \nLacey, 1996; Turner and Whitfield, 1997; Kajermo, et al., 1998; Parahoo, 2000; Parahoo, \net al., 2000; Tsai, 2000; Meerah, et al., 2001;).  Empirical evidence has indicated that the \nimpact of research depends on users valuing research, and on their ability to critique and \n 15\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \napply research evidence (DETYA, 2000).  Research from the education sector confirms \nthat users of research may also need more sustained opportunities to link their \nunderstanding of research to their experience (Zeuli, 1994).   \n \nIn the healthcare sector researchers have speculated on the benefits of development and \ntraining as a key approach to facilitating research use (Barta, 1995; Michel and Sneed, \n1995; Lacey, 1996; Turner and Whitfield, 1997; Kajermo, et al., 1998; Parahoo, et al., \n2000; Tsai, 2000; Parahoo, 2000).  For example, Parahoo (2000) argued for greater \nempowerment and the need to promote a culture in which users (nurses) recognised the \nneed for improved knowledge and skills.   \n \nResearch findings have shown that those using research literature were frequently doing \nso in the context of academic study.  For example, a study of managers in the US and \nAustralian education sector [principals] by Saha et al. (1995) and Biddle and Saha (2000) \nconcluded that post-graduate training had contributed towards raising a principal\u2019s regard \nfor research knowledge.  Further evidence from a UK case study by Wilson et al., (2003) \ndescribed how managers in the public sector had developed their positive attitudes and \ntheir skills through clearly targeted professional development activities, such as a \nuniversity masters programme.  The authors provided an example of a Masters \nprogramme jointly developed by a Higher Education Institution (HEI) and the Local \nAuthority (LA).   The aim was for the LA to work in partnership with a HEI to focus on \nspecific teaching and learning issues which were on the national agenda.   The \nprogramme attracted increasingly large numbers of principals and teachers who: engaged \n 16\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \nin their own research;  viewed research as a benefit rather than a threat; and created a \ncritical mass of senior and middle managers in education who engaged with and used \nresearch.  For many managers, this engagement with research as part of a Masters \nprogramme enabled them to cross the divide from practitioner, to user-researcher.    \n \nCollaboration, partnerships and links \nAuthors in the education field have frequently speculated that collaborative approaches, \npartnerships or links, and involving users in research are the keys to greater research \nutilisation in the public sector (Cousins and Simon, 1991; Turnbull, 1992; Bostrum and \nSuter, 1993; Zeuli and Tiezzi, 1993; Closs and Cheater, 1994; Kershner et al., 1998; \nWenger, 1998; Hagger and Mcintyre, 2000; Hannan, et al., 2000; Mortimore, 2000; \nPercy-Smith et al 2002; Wenger, et al., 2002).  Evidence from the public sector also \nsuggested that \u201cthe development of communication networks, and links between \nresearchers and practitioners, and greater involvement of practitioners in the research \nprocess, have emerged as strategies for improving research impact\u201d (Hemsley-Brown and \nSharp, 2003 p.461).  Based on the results of an empirical study Wilson et al., (2003 p.29) \nalso recommended that \u201cpartnership working\u201d such as \u201cseeking opportunites for \nprofessional researchers to work with users\u201d, was one approach that could be adopted \nsuccessfully.  Mechanisms such as collaborative approaches, the greater involvement of \nusers, and strong links between managers and researchers tended to facilitate mutual \ntrust.  Mutual trust allowed researchers to develop personal rapport with users and to feel \na greater stake in the manager\u2019s performance in the business sector (Zaltman, and \nMoorman, 1988; Hanjoon, and Chankon, 1994).  \n 17\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \n \nLouis (1996) has challenged some of the traditional theories of knowledge-use and \nargued that knowledge was not usable until it had been socially processed through \ncollective discussion and agreement on its validity and applicability.  Her paper argued \nthat current models are inadequate as a way of explaining dissemination and knowledge \nutilisation in education, despite the call for greater involvement of users and demands for \nresearchers to disseminate their findings more effectively.   \n \nLouis noted the recent move to involve practitioners in setting some research agendas, \nhowever, she contradicted Huberman (1990) by claiming that research evidence showed \nthat involving users did not necessarily make the research more useable \u2013 except among \nthose who had been directly involved.  She argued that extensive involvement of \npractitioners as researchers should occur for its own direct benefits, and not because it \nimproved the possibility of wider dissemination and utilization.  The main barriers to \nknowledge use in the public sector, she concluded were not at the level of individual \nresistance but lay in an institutionalised organisational culture that did not facilitate \nlearning through the use of research.  In common with Walter et al., (2003b) she \nsuggested that effective dissemination of ideas can be facilitated through the \nidentification and use of opinion leaders, who were accepted as such by their peers. \n \nDissemination strategies  \nPoor dissemination was often cited as the reason why management research was not \nconsumed by practitioners (Willmott, 1994).  There has been much discussion about \napproaches to the dissemination of research findings in management and other fields \n 18\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \n(Louis, et al., 1988; Winter, 1990; Bassett, 1992; Leimu, 1992;  Louis, 1992; Boostrom et \nal., 1993; Huberman, 1993; Klein, 1993a 1993b; Maccoll and White, 1996; Hillage, et \nal., 1998; Le May et al., 1998; Rumsey, 1998; Schmitt, 1999; NCDDR, 2000; Nutley and \nDavies, 2000; Tierney, 2000; Pinkowitz, 2002).  Kelemen and Bansal (2002) speculated \nthat management researchers needed to not only develop theories, but disseminate \nmanagement knowledge more successfully by targeting both academics and practitioners. \n \nProbably one of the most important developments in defining a theory of dissemination is \nthe increased focus on the social processes related to dissemination (Louis and Jones, \n2001).  Rogers (1995) presented a comprehensive analysis of the way new ideas are \ndisseminated and adopted by users, based on research carried out in the US.  Rogers\u2019s \ndiffusion of innovations model has been widely acknowledged as making a significant \ncontribution to understanding of the dissemination of new ideas and has attracted \nconsiderable interest recently in the context of research utilisation (see for example \nKanefsky, 2001; Nutley and Davies, 2000).  Based on the findings from a number of \nlongitudinal studies of agriculture, manufacturing, health education and technology, the \nauthor made the following recommendation for effective \u2018diffusion\u2019 of innovations: \nidentify opinion leaders and concentrate change agents\u2019 contacts on them to activate their \npeer networks.  Rogers also discussed the notion of  social marketing which he claimed, \naims \u2018to change behaviour in directions desired by the individuals who are impeded by \ninertia or other resistances\u2019 (Rogers, 1995 p 83). \n \n 19\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \nNutley et al., (2002b), however, examined Roger\u2019s (1995) diffusion of innovations model \nand concluded that there was a paucity of research recent evidence on effectiveness of \ndiffusion strategies in the context of dissemination of research knowledge.  They also \ncited a literature review by Bero et al., (1998) who found that passive dissemination of \ninformation such as articles in professional journals or the mailing of materials were \ngenerally ineffective and only resulted only in small changes in practice.  Nutley et al., \n(2002a) also commented that many of the activities surrounding evidence-based practice \nwere not in themselves evidence-based.   \n  \nIn a review of international research evidence on dissemination practices across several \ncountries, Louis (1992) argued that although there was much criticism of research on the \nbasis of its relevance to the interests of practitioners and users, she concluded, that good \npractice in dissemination of research evidence should be driven by researchers, rather \nthan users.  She found that systems driven by users tended to be based on delivering a \nsingle message to a mass audience \u2013 a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach whereas research \nevidence suggests that this approach was unlikely to be successful. Strategies are needed \nthat take into account the needs of a variety of users, and target specific groups, as \nopposed to targeting a mass audience with a single message. Increased networking has \nbeen recommended as a way of improving dissemination, especially during periods of \nrapid change because sharing of information was facilitated, research knowledge could be \ninterpreted to meet unique settings, and research impact was increased (Rogers, 1995; \nLouis, 1992; Kershner, et al., 1998; Wilson et al., 2003).  Strategies for more effective \ndissemination, therefore, are frequently discussed in the context of social marketing \n 20\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \n(Rogers, 1995). This has been advocated by the authors on the basis that dissemination \nshould meet the needs of the users and there is a need to create a demand for information \n(Cousins and Leithwood, 1993; Hemsley-Brown and Sharp, 2003).  \n \nCommunication networks \nA number of studies in the use of research in education and healthcare, concluded that \nnetworks to increase communication between researchers and users was an effective \napproach to facilitating research use (Kershner, et al., 1998; Wenger, 1998; Wenger, et \nal., 2002; Hemsley-Brown and Sharp, 2003; Wilson et al., 2003).  An empirical study of \n\u201cgood practice\u201d in research use by managers in education conducted in the UK (Wilson et \nal., 2003) found that \u201cthere was a great deal of networking and sharing of expertise\u201d and \na number of successful projects were based on encouraging the sharing of information.  \nThey recommended strategies for \u201cbuilding a critical mass of managers\u201d who had \nexperience of using research (Wilson et al., 2003 pp.19-20).  \n \nThese findings support Wenger et al., (2002) who also argued that the building of \nnetworks led to communities of practice \u2013 that is \u201cgroups of people who shared a \nconcern, a set of problems, and who share their knowledge\u201d (Wenger et al., 2002 p.4).  \nThey indicated that communities of practice cannot be cultivated in the same way as \ndeveloping traditional organizational structures and claimed that design and development \nwas more about \u201cfostering collaboration and participation, than about planning, directing \nand organizing activities\u201d (Wenger et al., 2002 p.13).  They argued that managers needed \nto understand and promote the kind of social structure within the organisation that can \n 21\nHemsley-Brown, J.V.

This suggests the need for strong leadership which also emerged as a key \nfacilitator in the use of research.   \n \nLeadership \nLeadership emerged as a key factor in facilitating research use by managers from three \nreviews of literature (Heller and Arozullah, 2000; Walter, et al., 2003b Wilson et al., \n2003).  Heller and Arozullah\u2019s (2000) review (cited by Walter, et al., 2003b) highlighted \nthe importance of four key features to successful organisational strategies: strong and \ncommitted organisational leadership; appropriately defined goals; a facilitative \ninfrastructure; and the means to integrate changes into everyday practice.  Leadership \nsupport needed to be provided at a sufficiently high level \u2013 \u201cstrong and visible \nleadership\u201d, helped provide motivation, authority and organisational integration (Walter, \net al., 2003b p.30) \n \nIn the management of education further support for the importance of leadership in \nfacilitating the use of research was provided by Wilson et al., (2003 p.viii) who claimed \nthat it was important to \u201censure that someone took on a leadership role in encouraging the \nuse of research\u201d, especially in the early stages of the change process.  They also \nhighlighted the need to establish an evidence-informed culture that encouraged reflection \nand criticism of existing practices together with opportunities to share experiences and \noutcomes.  Managers surveyed (Wilson et al., 2003 p.18) argued that \u201cleadership was \n 22\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \nimportant and inspirational and had won the hearts and minds\u201d of many of those involved \nin projects to increase research use.   \n \nDiscussion and conclusion  \nCritical analysis of the findings from this cross-sector literature review, suggests that \nthere are a number of barriers to research use that are common to managers in both the \nprivate and pubic sectors: access to research; the relevance of research; organisational \nsettings, and the gap between research and practice.  \n  \nAccess to research, and the problems associated with gaining easy access to relevant \nresearch findings was identified as a barrier in education, health and the business sector.  \nAuthors have frequently recommended that research findings should be more accessible \nbut for ideas to be accessible researchers may need to \u201cmarket their knowledge\u201d to the \npractitioner community \u201cas well as the research community\u201d (Hemsley-Brown and \nSharp, 2003).     \n \nCriticism of the relevance of research was a key factor which emerged from cross sector \nreviews, and was perceived to be a barrier to research use by managers in both the public \nsector (healthcare and education) and in the business sector.  However, criticism of \n\u2018relevance\u2019 and \u2018access\u2019 are too complex to address in this paper.  There has been \nconsiderable debate about purpose and scope of management research, which broadly \nrevolve around its fragmentation and its applied nature (Tranfield and Starkey, 1998).  \nTherefore, to make recommendations about the best ways to ensure that management \n 23\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \nresearch is \u201crelevant\u201d would reduce the discussion to a naively simplistic level.   \nNonetheless, there were examples of ways that practitioners and managers had been able \nto \u201cuse\u201d management research and find it \u201crelevant\u201d, for example by studying for a \nMasters level degree and by building collaborative networks.  \n      \nThird, the notion of a gap (e.g. Deshpande and Zaltman, 1982; Huberman, 1990; 1993) \nbetween the aims of researchers and the needs of users of research was also clear across \nall sectors, and in education particularly, evidence from research which has indicated that \nthere is also tension between users and researchers (e.g. DETYA, 2000), which was \nattributed to differences in their goals.  User-managers for example, tended to focus on \nsolving problems and were more likely to be seeking solutions to operational matters \n(Hemsley-Brown and Sharp, 2003).   Researchers, on the other hand, are characterised as \nseeking new knowledge for its own sake, and are frequently driven by a different agenda \nfrom users. There has been much debate concerning the best strategies for addressing the \nresearcher-user gap and the evidence appears to suggest that when researchers and users \ncollaborate, develop networks for communication, and there is greater involvement of \nusers in the design and conduct of the research, the impact of research and utilisation of \nresearch can be increased.  Across all sectors the factors associated with the \norganisational setting were also consistently identified as strong barriers to the \ndevelopment of a culture of research use, where managers might value research as a way \nof reducing risk in decision-making.  Based on this approach, the notion of a \ncollaborative community of researchers and user-managers has also been suggested and \ndiscussed at length by Wenger, et al., 2002 through the notion of \u2018communities of \n 24\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. (2004). \u2018Facilitating Research Utilisation: a cross sector review of the research evidence\u2019 \n\u2018International Journal of Public Sector Management\u2019 17, 6 pp 534-553. \n \npractice\u2019.    There is evidence that the gap can be reduced through education and training, \nand a change of culture can be encouraged, whereby, managers themselves become \nresearchers (researcher-managers) and, therefore, cross the researcher user divide.   \n \nOne key barrier \u2013 insufficient time to access research \u2013 emerged as a strong barrier to \nresearch use in the public sector (Wilson, et al., 2003).  Those in education often \nchallenge the validity of the research, and claimed that their unique situations invalidated \nthe application of its findings (Hemsley-Brown and Sharp, 2002).   In the public sector, \nthere was also some empirical evidence of successful strategies to overcome these \nbarriers.  Support and training was identified as a key facilitator for greater research \nutilisation and evidence indicates that greater use of research by managers had frequently \nbeen prompted by opportunities to cross the \u201cgap\u201d and become a user through \ninvolvement as a researcher.  Findings also indicated that one of the keys to facilitating \ngreater use of research is the involvement of users through networking and collaborative \nactivities, whereby the research can become more \u201crelevant\u201d to the individual and they \nfound the time to focus on accessing and sharing research within a more collaborative \nenvironment.    Such initiatives which often involved collaborative learning and sharing \nof ideas appeared to have increased research use among managers and practitioners. A \ncollaborative approach might also help to address the mistrust in research findings, \nidentified as a key barrier to research use in the business sector.     \n \nTo facilitate research use in the public sector, there is also need to provide \u201cstrong and \nvisible leadership\u201d (Walter et al., 2003b p.30) to create and develop an organisational \n 25\nHemsley-Brown, J.V.

A learning \nculture can be developed through advanced education and training; colleague support \nnetworks; and employing a critical mass of people with research skills to act as role \nmodels (Wilson et al., 2003).   The challenge is to bring about a cultural change which \nsupports and facilitates the development of professional expertise (Hammersley and \nScarth, 1993).     \n 26\nHemsley-Brown, J.V.
