His ability to recognize the target lesions of ery-\nthema multiforme, the Wickham\u2019s striae of lichen planus\nand the geometric picture of factitial dermatitis affords\nhim an advantageous position in therapy. Furthermore,\nthe pattern of fingerprints provides a means of identifying\nevery single one of the 6 000 000 000 people on our pla-\nnet. It even distinguishes between identical twins. In addi-\ntion, the distinctive palmar lines have spawned the\nthousands of spurious predictions of palmistry.\nSome patterns are indicative of ageing, such as wrinkles\nand the similar ridging of the fingernail plate. Onychogry-\nphosis and pincer nail also reflect ageing keratin synthesis.\nThe shoreline nail pattern and Beau\u2019s lines hark back to\nprior illness. Leukonychia is the sign of prior local injury\nto the nascent nail plate. The cutaneous horn stands as a\ndramatic sculpture of sun damage.\nWe first learn to recognize the distinctive branching\nChristmas tree pattern of pityriasis rosea, with its heraldic\nmother patch. Similar symmetrical branching patterns are\nseen at times with seborrheic keratoses. The peripheral\nnerve routes are revealed by the patterns of pain and blis-\nters in herpes zoster.\nMore patterns arise from the disease. These range from\nthe rare, tinea imbricata to the common alopecia areata\nand the fish scaling of ichthyosis. Moreover, genetic deter-\nminants account for a singular lot of common as well as\nrare patterns. Think of the common horizontal versus the\nV-shaped anterior hairline. Think of curled versus straight\nhair and then consider the rare genetic uncombable hair.\nNo one can fail to recognize the patterned hair loss of\nage.\nAmong the rare congenital and gene responsible\ncutaneous patterns, we see linear markings at embryo-\nnic closure lines such as linea pigmentosa. We see the\ngrooves of nasal lines, branchial fissures and preauricular\nsinuses.\nThe most remarkable and often inapparent patterns\nare those resulting from the fact that we may inherit two\ndistinct embryonic skins.

The most vivid\nresult is seen in incontinentia pigmenti.

No two\nregions of skin are identical excepting the conservation of\nbilateral symmetry. The heterogeneity of skin ecology, its\npatterning, is based on unique gross and cellular make-up,\nwhich in turn reflects the heterogeneity in molecular con-\nstitution, molecular expression and molecular interaction.\nThe sharp and easily recognizable patterns of skin dis-\nease reflect the underlying differences in regional skin.\nMorphologically, this is seen, for example, in acne vulgaris\nof the sebaceous follicle in the seborrheic areas and andro-\ngenetic alopecia of the hormone-sensitive hair follicles on\nthe scalp. Disease pattern, however, is based on the\npathology or aberrations of constituent regional mole-\ncules, induced by multiple aetiologies: genetic, immunolo-\ngical, physical, chemical, infectious, etc. Studies of\nmolecular mechanisms of skin disease have revealed many\nexamples of molecular aberrations, which are responsible\nfor the disease.\nA good example of heterotopic distribution of members\nof a gene family is amongst the keratins (2). Genetic muta-\ntions in specific keratins generate disorders unique to spe-\ncific histological regions, for example, mutation of K6a\nexpressed in palmar\/plantar skin (pachynychia congenital),\nof K4 and K13 in mucosal skin (white sponge naevus), of\nK5 and K14 in truncal skin (epidermolysis bullosa sim-\nplex), of K1 and K10 in interfollicular skin (epidermolytic\nhyperkeratosis) and of hHb6 keratin in the hair shaft (mo-\nnilethrix). Mutations in members of collagen and associ-\nated gene families give rise to distinct cutaneous clinical\npresentations (e.g. 3). Amongst autoimmune disorders,\naberrant antibodies to specific epidermal desmogleins give\nrise to either superficial or deep pemphigus depending on\nthe specific desmoglein attacked (4). The specific location\nof the immunosuppressive molecule CD200 to the follicu-\nlar bulge could explain the preservation of that structure\nin alopecia areata (5). Even in infectious diseases, the dis-\ntribution of infection appears to depend on some specific\nregional molecular characteristic. Recently, it was found\nthat the papilloma virus preferentially infects hair follicle\nstem cells (6,7); indeed, this association could explain the\ndiscrete lesion generated by this infection.\nIn our view, we would predict that when the disease\npattern is not typical, the molecular basis for that disorder\nis also not typical. In the latter case, the agent may differ\nmolecularly, such as a mutant variety of an infectious\nagent, or the resident skin may differ such as a genetic\npolymorphism of a structural or regulatory molecule. The\nprediction would extend to the idea that the therapeutic\napproach may have to be modified to meet the situation \u2013\npharmacogenomics.\nFigure 1. Peacock feather.\nChuong et al.\n548\nIn summary, it is our opinion that dermatological dis-\neases are highly patterned because the molecular make-up\nof skin is also highly patterned: pattern reflects function,\nfunction reflects morphology, morphology reflects molecu-\nlar structure and disease reflects molecular perturbation \u2013\ncaused by manifold and sundry aetiologies. By under-\nstanding molecular structure, molecular networks, molecu-\nlar properties and the control of molecular expression, we\nwill understand the disease and its therapies. What gener-\nates cutaneous patterning and controls it? Ah, but that is\nthe question\u2026! (e.g. 8\u201313).\nK. Stenn, S. Parimoo and Y.

As this canvas covers the\nsurface of an individual, changes that lead to non-random\npatterns are likely to catch people\u2019s attention, triggering fas-\ncination or revulsion, astounding the experts and providing\ninvaluable diagnostic clues to the dermatologist. Patterns\non the skin can be due to physiological, pathological or arti-\nfactual causes. Distinct regions, skin appendages, skin rid-\nges, cutaneous nerves, blood vessels, etc. contribute to skin\npattern in a manner that is either visible to the naked eye or\nonly apparent under the microscope. When skin lesions\ndevelop, they either follow obvious anatomical differences\nor follow \u2018hidden\u2019 patterns based on genetic\/developmental\nmechanisms that were laid down earlier and that were not\nobvious in the adult. Then, time adds another dimension to\nskin patterns through temporal cyclic regeneration of some\nskin appendages. It is upon this dynamic landscape of the\nskin that skin lesions often develop, distribute, arrange\nthemselves and change in striking patterns that have been\nmeticulously recorded and commented on since the earliest\ndays of modern clinical dermatology.\nAnd yet, the key question \u2013 \u2018why do all these visible\npatterns of (and even within) skin lesions form?\u2019 \u2013 remains\none of the least investigated and most neglected among\nthe central problems of dermatology. [Note that this ques-\ntion should not be confused with histopathological pattern\nformation, which is observed when these skin lesions are\nexamined under the microscope (e.g. 1); histopathological\npattern formation is not covered here.]\nPerhaps, the most promising way to reduce the endur-\ning controversies over what really causes skin lesion pat-\nterning is to explore the biological basis of these patterns.\nThis exercise may greatly improve our understanding of\nthe pathogenesis of a given skin disorder and allow unique\ninsights into the general basis of pattern formation in bio-\nlogy as well. To this end, we propose several defined cat-\negories of biological mechanisms that produce skin\npatterns and that also serve as the basis for patterned skin\nlesions (Table 1). In the following, we attempt to define\nand briefly survey these categories, as an aid to future,\nsystematic research into the biological basis of skin lesion\npatterns.\nCategories of skin patterns\n1. Lineage-based genetic mosaicism\nThe basis for this pattern is that some cells are changed\ngenetically or epigenetically during development. The\nabnormal functions of these cells then manifest themselves\nin the skin. The reason they are not distributed randomly is\nbecause these inactivation events occur very early during\ndevelopment and are transmitted to the progeny of these\nearly precursor cells. In their migratory paths into the skin,\nthe defects become outwardly visible. The changes can be\ntransmitted through cell division because they involve\nsomatic mutations in DNA or are mediated by epigenetic\nmechanisms such as X chromosome inactivation, DNA\nmethylation, etc. (see Viewpoint 2). There are several stri-\nking examples in which lesions are limited to the left or\nright side of the body, regional segments, checker board\npatterns or linear distributions, which have been analysed\nso ingeniously by Rudolf Happle (2\u20134 and Viewpoint 2).\nThe patterns become macroscopically discernible if\nthese progenies are distributed in a particular fashion. The\nmost striking example in the epidermal lineage is the Blas-\nchko lines (5). A recent case of linearly distributed acne\nturns out to be due to a somatic mutation in the fibroblast\ngrowth factor (FGF) receptor in one epidermal cell lineage\n(6). The mechanism leading to the Blaschko lines is funda-\nmental and not limited to humans. When early chicken\nembryo epidermal cells (embryonic day 2) were labelled\nalong the dorsal midline with replication defective virus\nexpressing beta-galactosidase, their progenies showed mul-\ntiple parallel blue lines radiating from the midline across\nControversies\n549\nthe dorsal skin of late chicken embryos resembling Christ-\nmas tree branches (7).\n2. Region-specific patterns\nRegional specificity implies that different skin regions such\nas the scalp, beards, eyebrows, facial region, lips, palms,\nnails, mammary glands, sweat glands, etc. have different\ncharacteristics. Epidermal precursors are initially multi-\npotent and competent to form all these different structures.\nDuring development, special domains of dermis begin\nsending specific messages to the epidermis. Through a ser-\nies of epithelial\u2013mesenchymal interactions, these different\nskin domains with special structures and functions gradu-\nally emerge. The integument diversifies to endow different\nfunctions to different parts of the human skin. When a\nmolecule fundamental to these processes is mutated, mul-\ntiple epithelial organs may be affected as seen in ectoder-\nmal dysplasia (8). When lesions are specific to certain\nregions, they form specific patterns. For example, inherited\nstructural defects of hair and nails evidently are limited to\nwhere these types of skin appendages are present.\nHow these dermal specificities and epidermal competence\nare set up in development is still under investigation. A\nmodel based on a skin Hox code was proposed, suggesting\nthat different combinations of Hox gene expression may be\nthe basis of skin regional specificity, and may set up the sub-\nsequent differences in diffusible morphogens and adhesion\nmolecules (9). Indeed, there are spatiotemporally defined,\nspecific HOX expression patterns in human skin (10) and\nthe Hox expression patterns of dermal cells derived from\ndifferent topological skin regions are different (11). Most\ninterestingly, the characteristics of these different skin\nregions have been shown to \u2018intraconvert\u2019, i.e. respecifica-\ntion to an ectopic fate from the original characteristics\nthrough pathological process or experimental manipulation.\nFor example, the engrailed pathway was shown to be\ninvolved in defining the mesenchymal characteristics of the\nventral versus the dorsal paw (12). Tbx4 and Tbx5 are\nshown to be involved in defining the identity of the chicken\nleg versus wing and hence scale or feather forming dermis\n(13). Epidermal cells can trans-differentiate and convert\nhairs into glands or scales to feathers under the influence of\nretinoic acid or by ectopic expression of specific molecules\nsuch as beta-catenin (14\u201316). A recently engineered K14\u2013\nnoggin transgenic mouse shows that sweat glands are trans-\nformed to hairs (17), while noggin overexpression under the\nneuron-specific enolase promoter can convert outer root\nsheath keratinocytes into sebocytes (18). An adult cornea\ncan also be diverted to form pilosebaceous units when they\nare confronted with embryonic hair forming dermis (19).\nThese observations imply that the establishment of specific\nregions is based on a balance of molecular signalling net-\nworks. Understanding the regulation of skin regional specif-\nicity has the potential to enable the manipulation of\nepidermal stem cell fate for medical applications.\nAnother interesting aspect is the arrangement of indi-\nvidual appendage elements within the region. During skin\ndevelopment, hair primordia are laid out in sequential\norder and their arrangement and orientation reflect a pro-\npagating global wave of skin appendage formation. Loss\nof frizzled 6 in transgenic mice leads to the formation of\nmultiple whirls (20), suggesting the involvement of the wnt\npathway in this process. In humans, the whirls of scalp\nhairs are most apparent [reviewed in Ref. (21)], yet the\nformation of hair whirls is not entirely under genetic con-\ntrol. A pair of homozygotic twins was shown to have one\nand two whirls, respectively (22). Likewise, fingerprints of\nhomozygotic twins are similar but non-identical (23).\nTherefore, stochastic events involving physico-chemical\ninteractions such as reaction\u2013diffusion are likely to be\ninvolved [reviewed in Ref. (24) and references therein].\nKnowing how these morphogenetic processes work is not\nonly important for understanding the biological basis of\nskin lesion patterns, but also for individual identification\nand engineering of the skin.\n3. Pattern formation by interactions with\nmelanocytes\nThe patterns observed in categories 1 and 2 involve only\nepidermal and dermal cells. As development proceeds, the\npresumptive skin continues to build its complexity by\ninteracting with other tissues, such as nerves and blood\nvessels. One most apparent interaction is the immigration\nof melanocytes. Melanoblasts from the neural crest\nmigrate into the presumptive skin and may form dramatic\nvisible patterns as seen in zebra stripes and leopard spots.\nIn humans, individuals also have skin regions with differ-\nent levels of pigmentation (8). For example, the palm is of\nlighter colour than the dorsal part of the hand. This is\nTable 1. Categories of patterned skin lesions\nCategory Manifestation Mechanism\n1.

Recent work suggests that the high DKK (a wnt\npathway antagonist) level secreted by palm fibroblasts\nmay contribute to the establishment of this pattern (25).\nIn piebaldism, the white tufts of frontal and eyebrow hairs\nresult from a mutation in the stem cell factor receptor,\nKIT, with the subsequent absence of melanocytes in a\ndefined skin region (8). While the biochemical basis of this\nlesion is now clear, how such a sharply demarcated region\nis defined or how melanocytes enter or avoid a particular\nregion in human skin is still totally unknown.\n4. Anatomically or physiologically based\npatterns\nBecause sensory skin nerves innervate a defined derma-\ntome, some lesions may be manifested along this domain\nwhen this nerve is preferentially affected. For example,\nherpes varicella-zoster virus spreads along sensory nerve\nfibres, and patient\u2019s skin lesions follow a strikingly seg-\nmental, zonal distribution (26). Likewise, Lesions can be\ndistributed along the blood supply delivered by the periph-\neral skin blood vessels. Venous and arterial ulcers as well\nas vascular malformations are patterned by the underlying\nblood vessel pathology. In diabetes, the skin ulcers occur\nmore in the distal end of the lower extremities because of\npoor blood supply to reach these skin regions. And infec-\ntious agents that selectively target specific skin appendages\n(e.g. Demodex folliculorum mites, lice: hair follicle) will evi-\ndently cause skin lesion patterns explained by the distribu-\ntion of these skin appendages in a given skin territory.\nAlong the same lines, different regions of human skin\nshow different, developmentally determined characteristics,\nwhich translate into different skin lesion patterns, based on\nthe different physiological and anatomical properties of\neach region. For example, in seborrheic dermatitis, the folli-\ncular distribution pattern of hyperkeratotic or inflamma-\ntory skin lesions is determined by the distribution of\npilosebaceous units and the microflora that colonize them.\nAtopic eczema tends to favour particularly moist flexural\nskin. Candida and dermatophyte infections preferentially\ntarget intertriginous skin. Regions with high physical pres-\nsure tend to develop wounding or ulcers or display pressure\nurticaria, especially in conditions of stasis and a relative\nlack of oxygenation. During wound healing, hypertrophic\nscars tend to develop more frequently in anatomical areas,\nexhibiting higher skin tension ( 27). Prevention or treatment\nof patterned skin lesions may be achieved by changing or\nrespecting these local characteristics (e.g. by adapting surgi-\ncal procedures so as to reduce tension and thereby the\namount of scar tissue formation in a given skin region).\n5. Hair cycle-based patterns\nA special subcategory of \u2018Anatomically or physiologically\nbased patterns\u2019, which for practical purposes we treat here\nas a separate pattern-forming mechanism, relates to the\ncycling transformation of hair follicles between phases of\ngrowth (anagen), regression (catagen), hair shaft shedding\n(exogen) and relative rest (telogen) (28,29). The differenti-\nation products of these skin appendages (hair shafts) can\ndisappear and reappear temporally. If club hairs are\nretained in the follicular canal, the macroscopic appearance\nwill remain largely unchanged. If hair filaments are dis-\nlodged while new hairs have not grown back, instead, bald\nregions form. The classical clinical example for this is alo-\npecia areata, an autoimmune disorder whose pattern is hair\ncycle based in a dual sense: the inflammatory cell infiltrate\nin alopecia areata exclusively attacks hair follicles that are\nin their active growth stage (anagen), and then alters their\nnormal cycling behaviour by prematurely catapulting them\ninto catagen, along with \u2013 sometimes dramatic \u2013 wave-pat-\nterned hair shaft shedding (8,30).\nIf hairs fall out at a rather specific time point of the\nhair cycle, followed by later regrowth, this can produce a\nmoving wave of bald and hairy regions. This is not only\nseen in alopecia areata, but, e.g. also in the premature and\nprecise shedding of hair shafts in Foxn1 and Msx2 null\nmice (31,32). In humans, hair follicles cycle independently\n(\u2018mosaic\u2019 hair follicle cycling) so that the dramatic wave\npatterns typically seen in mice (33) are quite unusual. In\nany case, the pattern-forming mechanism here is that cer-\ntain skin structures have been developmentally pro-\ngrammed to undergo cyclic transformations (29), which\ncan produce patterned skin lesions in later life.\n6. Hormonally based patterns\nUpon puberty, skin appendages in specific regions are trans-\nformed when sex hormone pathways, estrogens and andro-\ngens are activated. Sex steroids not only prominently affect\nhair follicles, but also the hypertrophy\/atrophy status of\nsebaceous glands or the melanogenic activity of epidermal\nmelanocytes, giving rise to hormonally based patterns of\nskin lesions, as seen, e.g. in acne, androgenetic alopecia and\nhirsutism. Different sexual dimorphism characteristics are\nendowed in mammals including humans (34). A dramatic\nexample of this is also seen in birds, namely in the different\nfeathering between roosters and hens (35). In human beard,\naxilla and genital regions, hair follicles are transformed\nfrom the vellus to the terminal hair. With increasing age,\nthe reverse tends to occur, leading to androgenic alopecia,\nwhile vellus hairs can be transformed into unwanted ter-\nminal hairs (e.g. on the upper lip and lower legs) when prop-\nerly stimulated by androgens, leading to hirsutism. Here,\nterminal hairs in the frontal and parietal scalp are affected\nbut not those in the occipital region. As a result, the hairline\nrecedes gradually on a patient\u2019s foreheads.\nThe long unclear molecular question as to why scalp and\noccipital hairs have different responses to sex hormones is\nbecoming increasingly understood because hair follicles of a\ndefined skin region seem to be developmentally pro-\ngrammed to respond with strikingly distinct changes in gene\nand protein expression, namely of key hair growth-modula-\ntory agents, to stimulation with androgens or estrogens\n(29,36,37). Thus, hormonally based skin lesion patterns are\nalso results of region-specific developmental programming.\n7. Environmentally based patterns\nSkin patterns can also result from interactions with\nthe environment, particularly in terms of light and\ntemperature. For example, chronic sun exposure of human\nskin leads to the characteristic signs of actinic skin damage,\nwith the UV light-induced patterns corresponding to\nunclothed skin regions. Cold exposure triggers the reticular\npatterns of livedo reticularis and livedo racemosa and cau-\nses blood and\/or blood vessel-based pathology to become\nclinically apparent in defined vascular territories (e.g. in\nControversies\n551\nRaynaud syndrome and cryoglobulinemia) (8,26,38). In\nnature, changes in the length of the light period that are\ntranslated into changes in the plasma melatonin and pro-\nlactin level can trigger animals to change to a longer\/shor-\nter or whiter\/darker coat so as to improve their chances for\nsurvival during a given season (39). Now that we know that\nhuman and rodent skin and hair follicles are even extrapi-\ntuitary sites of melatonin synthesis (40\u201342), one wonders to\nwhich extent environmental cues (such as the length of the\nlight period) can also affect seasonal changes in the quality,\nquantity and distribution of patterned skin lesions.\n8. Artificial\nIn this category, we can liberally group culture-based pat-\nterns of skin \u2018lesions\u2019, such as tattoos, breast implants,\nhair transplants, abdominal liposuction, etc. These artifi-\ncial patterns are meant to alter the body contour and dis-\nplay body messages to a defined social environment. Of\ncourse, some diseases can arise secondarily from these pro-\ncedures and then also present as skin patterns (e.g. allergic\neczema against henna allergens arising in a tattoo).\nA true understanding of abnormal conditions is bred by\na genuine understanding of what is normal. Here we have\nsurveyed possible biological and other mechanisms that\nunderlie patterns of skin lesions. Through this exercise, we\nalso hope to get closer to explaining the many \u2013 still mys-\nterious \u2013 patterns of reoccurring skin lesions (often even in\nloco!) that characterize many chronic inflammatory skin\ndiseases such as psoriasis, lichen planus, dermatomyositis,\nlupus erythematosus and Reiter\u2019s disease (8,30). None of\nthese patterns can as yet be convincingly classified into one\nof the above categories for which reasonable biological\nexplanations are available. Also, once we have been able to\nexplain the remaining mysteries of pattern formation in\nand of skin lesions, chances are that we will also have come\nmuch closer to clarifying the pathogenesis of these derma-\ntoses. This will confirm the classical insight that pattern\nformation is at the very basis of life and its many states of\ndysfunction (43,44). Viewed from this perspective, the skin\nand its lesional patterns become far more than a living can-\nvas, and turn into a window to an as yet undiscovered\nworld of biology and pathology.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Violet Shen, Randall B.

Some of\nmy concepts and hypotheses have been confirmed in\nthe meantime, some turned out to be wrong, whereas\nothers are still waiting to be challenged at the molecular\nlevel.\nHere I would like to discuss some concepts and doc-\ntrines that are still controversial, and to describe perspec-\ntives regarding further research in this field.\nThe lines of Blaschko, a well-established pattern\nThe concept that Blaschko\u2019s lines (Fig. 1) visualize the\ndorsoventral outgrowth of a mutant cell clone (Fig. 2) was\nadvanced, in German language with English summaries,\nduring the years 1977\/1978 (1,2). Today this view is gener-\nally accepted. I still take pride in the fact, however, that\nmy first paper written in English on this subject, entitled\n\u2018Genetic mechanisms which may explain the pattern of\nBlaschko\u2019s lines\u2019, was rejected in 1977 by the British Jour-\nnal of Dermatology. One of the reviewers thought that my\nideas were too hypothetical and far-fetched. At that time,\nI was so demoralized that I did not submit my paper to\nanother journal. But 8 years later essential parts of the\nmanuscript were published, with only minimal updating,\nin Human Genetics (3), and the article still turned out to\nbe taken as novel.\nPresently, mosaicism has been proven at the cellular\nlevel in many disorders following Blaschko\u2019s lines (4).\nFrom animal experiments, we can conclude that the con-\ncept of dorsoventral proliferation of two different cell\nclones holds true (5,6), although a direct proof in human\nskin does not exist and is unlikely to be feasible.\nGenomic versus epigenetic mosaicism\nTwo major categories of mosaicism can be distinguished\n(4). The pattern of Blaschko\u2019s lines may reflect genomic\nmosaicism that is usually caused by a postzygotic muta-\ntion, but occasionally may also originate from a prezy-\ngotic event in the form of gametic half-chromatid\nmutation (7). Or, it may reflect epigenetic mosaicism that\nwould be either X-linked or autosomal.\nLyonization: X-linked retrotransposons and the\nlines of Blaschko\nFunctional X-chromosome mosaicism (lyonization)\nexplains the systematized linear patterns as observed in\nincontinentia pigmenti, Goltz syndrome, Conradi\u2013Hu\u00a8ner-\nmann\u2013Happle syndrome, Partington syndrome and various\nother X-linked genodermatoses (4,7). These linear skin dis-\norders most likely reflect the action of retrotransposons (4).\nAs far as we know today, experimental evidence indi-\ncates that both X-linked and autosomal epigenetic mosai-\ncism is caused by the action of retrotransposons (8). On\nthe X chromosome, a significant accumulation of LINE-1\nretrotransposons was found in the region of the X-inacti-\nvation centre at Xq13 (8), and this finding most likely\nreflects a functional significance (9).\nHeritable autosomal mosaicism: the role\nof retrotransposons\nRetrotransposons are particles of retroviral origin. They\nare interspersed in large numbers in the genome of plants\nand animals (10). Some retrotransposons are able to\nsilence or activate the expression of a neighbouring gene\nby methylation or demethylation. At an early developmen-\ntal stage, the action of such \u2018metastable epialleles\u2019 may\nresult in heritable \u2013 but non-Mendelian \u2013 traits character-\nized by a variegated coat pattern reminiscent of the lines\nof Blaschko. Examples are the mouse mutant viable yel-\nlow agouti (11,12) and the brindled trait in dogs (13).\nIn human medicine, cases of autosomal pigmentary\nmosaicism visualizing the lines of Blaschko may show, by\nway of exception, a familial aggregation (14,15). In the past,\nthis was difficult to explain. It seems conceivable that the\nFigure 1. Archetypical patterns of mosaicism in human skin.\nType 1a: lines of Blaschko, narrow bands; type 1b: lines of\nBlaschko, broad bands; type 2: checkerboard pattern; type 3:\nphylloid pattern; type 4: patchy pattern without midline\nseparation; type 5: lateralization.\nFigure 2. Proposed explanation of the fountain-like pattern of\nBlaschko\u2019s lines on the back. The transversal proliferation of\nprecursor cells starts from the primitive streak and interferes\nwith the longitudinal growth and increasing flexion of the\nembryo.\nControversies\n553\naction of a retrotransposon may account for such familial\ncases (13).\nIn the near future, research on retrotransposons will\nalmost certainly play a major role in the elucidation of the\ngenetic basis of mosaic phenotypes visualizing the lines of\nBlaschko, but also of other disorders including skin cancer.\nHeritable autosomal mosaicism: paradominance\nand the lines of Blaschko\nAn alternative explanation of the familial occurrence of\nautosomal mosaic traits is the concept of paradominant\ntransmission (16). Heterozygous individuals are usually\nhealthy. Only if allelic loss would occur at an early devel-\nopmental stage and gave rise to a homozygous cell clone,\nthe disorder would become manifest as a mosaic.\nThis concept has been proposed to explain familial\ncases of sebaceous naevus (17) as well as of other mosaic\nphenotypes such as Klippel\u2013Trenaunay syndrome (18).\nMolecular proof is so far lacking.\nAre Blaschko\u2019s lines of ectodermal origin?\nSome authors are convinced that the pattern of Blaschko\u2019s\nlines is exclusively of ectodermal origin (19). Celia Moss\nhas advanced the hypothesis that epidermal cells follow\nBlaschko\u2019s lines, but fibroblasts may not (20).\nI hesitate to believe this. For example, the lesions of\nfocal dermal hypoplasia clearly follow Blaschko\u2019s lines,\nand they are definitely of mesodermal origin. Other exam-\nples suggesting the possibility of a mesodermal origin of\nBlaschko\u2019s lines are linear atrophoderma of Moulin (21)\nand linear progressive fibromatosis (22).\nTo reconcile her ectodermal theory with such mesoder-\nmal disorders, Moss (20) has offered the auxiliary hypo-\nthesis that the dermal deficiency may be secondary to\nepidermal pathology. I think that this is a less likely\nexplanation of mesodermal defects along Blaschko\u2019s lines.\nFuture research may show which view is correct.\nFacial lines of Blaschko are intersecting\nAnother problem arose when we studied the arrangement\nof Blaschko\u2019s lines on the head and neck (23). We docu-\nmented a definite crossing of lines, sometimes even at an\nangle of 90\u0002 (Fig. 3). Does this mean that the direction of\nembryonic movements is highly variable on the head? Or\ndo particular disorders give rise to particular patterns? I\nfeel that the second explanation is less likely, but the ques-\ntion has so far not been settled.\nLateralization: a unique pattern of lyonization\nCongenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform naevus and\nlimb defects (CHILD) syndrome F is caused by mutations\nin NSDHL localized at Xq28 (24,25). NSDHL controls\nthe production of 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, an\nenzyme involved in cholesterol metabolism. In typical\ncases, the CHILD naevus shows a unilateral, diffuse\ninvolvement with a clear-cut midline demarcation (Fig. 4)\n(26). This lateralization has to be categorized as a pattern\nof lyonization which is, however, strikingly gross. I have\nhypothesized that the origin of a clone of organizer cells\ncoincides and interferes with the event of X-inactivation\n(7,27). Another explanation would be a defective function\nof the sonic hedgehog pathway in which NSDHL is\ninvolved, resulting in a disturbed left\u2013right asymmetry\n(28).\nHowever this may be, the lateralization pattern of CHILD\nsyndrome apparently heralds a gene that plays a pivotal role\nin pattern formation at an early developmental stage.\nThe checkerboard pattern\nThe human pigmentary system appears to be particularly\ndivergent with regard to mosaic patterns (Fig. 1). A flag-\nlike arrangement with a strict midline separation has been\nobserved in cases of chimaerism (29). Clinical examples\nvisualizing a mosaic checkerboard pattern are speckled\nlentiginous naevus and Becker\u2019s naevus (4,30).\nThe phylloid pattern: a new subject of\ndermatological research\nThe phylloid pattern is characterized by multiple leaf-like\nor oblong macules reminiscent of the floral ornaments of\nart nouveau style (Fig. 5) (30). The recognition of this\nnew pattern of cutaneous mosaicism resulted, within a\nFigure 3. Facial lines of Blaschko showing definite crossing\n(23).\nFigure 4. Lateralization pattern of CHILD syndrome.\nChuong et al.\n554\nshort period of time, in the delineation of a novel neuro-\ncutaneous syndrome in the form of phylloid hypomelano-\nsis (31). This disorder is caused by mosaic trisomy 13\n(32).\nIt is so far unknown which mechanism may cause this\npeculiar pattern, and why phylloid hypomelanosis is so\nclosely related to numerical anomalies of chromosome 13.\nPatchy pattern without midline separation\nLarge congenital melanocytic naevi usually occur sporad-\nically. Because we never observe a corresponding disorder\nthat involves the entire integument, I have proposed the\nconcept of a lethal mutation surviving by mosaicism (33).\nMolecular evidence supporting this concept is so far not\navailable, but can be expected for the near future.\nIn 2004, Mehraein (34) reported, in a case of ring chro-\nmosome 7, somatic mosaicism showing significant gain of\nchromosome 7 within a highly proliferating melanocytic\ncongenital naevus. Admittedly, however, this skin lesion\nwas not a giant melanocytic naevus.\nWhat is a naevus?\nIn 1995 I proposed a new definition of the word naevus\n(35): \u2018Nevi are visible, circumscribed, long-lasting lesions of\nthe skin or the neighboring mucosa, reflecting mosaicism.\nWith the exception of melanocytic nevi, they do not show\nneoplastic growth. They never show malignant neoplasia.\u2019\nMy essential point was to postulate genetic mosaicism.\nThis paper aroused many excited discussions, especially\nin the French literature (36), because French dermatolo-\ngists had decided, some years ago, to create an exclusively\nFrench definition of the term naevus (37). For example, I\nhad difficulties to decide whether I should be amused or\nnot by a commentary of Drs Delescluse and Broeckx from\nBrussels (38) who wrote in 1995: \u2018The Francophones had\nproposed that the European currency should be named\nECU, the Germans didn\u2019t accept it, and our ECU shall\nnow bear the name EURO. With regard to dermatology,\nwe should not bow to the new German suggestion, and\nkeep our French terminology.\u2019 Fortunately, this bizarre\nstory has come to a good end. Some years later, at a cock-\ntail reception of an AAD meeting, Dr Delescluse took my\narm and said: \u2018Your definition of naevus was right! Let\u2019s\nhave a photograph together.\u2019 And so we did. In the mean-\ntime, the concept of mosaicism has been confirmed in\nmany different types of naevi (4).\nI must admit, however, that in the last sentence of my\ndefinition, I have expressed myself unclear. My statement\nthat naevi \u2018never show malignant neoplasia\u2019 was misunder-\nstood by some critics (39). Of course, naevi can undergo\nmalignant degeneration, but the resulting malignant tum-\nors are no longer naevi. For instance, a malignant melan-\noma originating from a melanocytic naevus cannot be\ncategorized as a naevus.\nIf we accept the concept that all naevi by definition rep-\nresent mosaics, we have to acknowledge that the salmon\npatch, a vascular macule that is found in about half of ne-\nonates and only in particular midline areas such as the nu-\nchal or glabellar region, is certainly not a true naevus, but\nshould rather be categorized as a nevoid lesion. I think\nthat this is acceptable. Otherwise, we had to create, as sug-\ngested by some critics (40), a neologism to denote the\nnaevi fulfilling the definition as described above (35), and\nthis would be preposterous.\nZosteriform naevi do not exist\nThe arrangement of naevi according to Blaschko\u2019s lines or\nto the checkerboard pattern is sometimes described as \u2018zo-\nsteriform\u2019 (41,42). It should be borne in mind, however,\nthat this designation is incorrect (43). So far, I could not\nfind in the literature any naevus being truly zosteriform,\ni.e. showing a dermatomal arrangement similar to that of\nherpes zoster.\n\u2018Naevus unius lateris\u2019 is an irrelevant term\nEven in our times, the outdated name \u2018naevus unius later-\nis\u2019 is still used by some authors (44,45). From a genetic\npoint of view, it does not matter whether a naevus is uni-\nlateral or bilateral in a given case. Even the CHILD nae-\nvus, the hallmark of CHILD syndrome, rather often\nshows, in addition to lateralization, a mild contralateral\ninvolvement (26). In other words, a \u2018naevus unius lateris\u2019\ndoes not exist. This term reveals the absence of genetic\nthinking and is entirely useless.\nNaevus flammeus is an indispensable term\nAccording to a presently prevailing doctrine, facial naevi\nflammei do no longer exist because they are now called \u2018capil-\nlary malformations\u2019 (46\u201348). Dermatologists who are using\nthis fashionable term should realize that there is no specific\nnosological entity to be called \u2018capillary malformation\u2019.\nIn other words, naevus flammeus is a specific disorder\nreflecting mosaicism, whereas \u2018capillary malformation\u2019 has\na rather broad meaning that includes naevus flammeus,\nnaevus anemicus, the non-mosaic vascular lesions of Ren-\ndu\u2013Osler disease and various other skin lesions.\nFigure 5. Phylloid hypomelanosis.\nControversies\n555\nHypothesis: naevus flammeus is not\ndermatomal\nWith regard to the so-called trigeminal distribution of\nfacial naevi flammei, we are still living in medieval times.\nWhen examining photographs of such vascular lesions\n(Fig. 6), I wonder why the strange belief of a causal rela-\ntionship to the ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular\nbranches of the trigeminal nerve has been taken as a\ndogma since more than 100 years. Most of the presently\navailable textbooks say that the vascular naevi of Sturge\u2013\nWeber syndrome are visualizing the branches of the trige-\nminal nerve (46,48).\nI seriously doubt that this is correct. Fortunately, I am\nnot entirely alone with my scepticism. Many years ago\nAlexander (49) has voiced similar doubts. Perhaps, the\narrangement of naevi flammei corresponds to a checker-\nboard pattern (4). This problem should be investigated by\nthe application of modern techniques of examination to\ndetermine which view is correct.\nConclusion\nCutaneous mosaicism continues to be a fascinating field\nof research. Besides the problems of pattern formation\nas treated in this debate, there are other mosaic phe-\nnomena waiting for further elucidation such as rever-\ntant mosaicism in autosomal recessive skin diseases\n(50), type 2 segmental manifestation of autosomal dom-\ninant skin disorders (51,52) or didymosis (twin spotting)\n(53).\nWith regard to pattern formation in mosaic skin disor-\nders, the role of retrotransposons will hopefully be\nexplored soon by a new generation of investigators devo-\nted to experimental dermatology.\nRudolf Happle\nDepartment of Dermatology\nPhilipp University of Marburg\nDeutschhausstrasse 9\n35033 Marburg\nGermany\nE-mail: happle@med.uni-marburg.de\nReferences\n1.

That is, an initially homogeneous\nsystem becomes spatially, and sometimes temporally, inho-\nmogeneous. Examples include the wind-dependent genera-\ntion of sand dunes, the abrupt appearance of hexagonal\nconvection cells in a thin layer of oil heated from below\nand a remarkable phenomenon known as the Belusov\u2013\nZhabotinsky reaction where a chemical reaction in a shal-\nlow dish can spontaneously form a chemical concentration\npattern (1). These latter patterns can be stationary, mani-\nfest as unchanging spots or stripes, or wave like, in which\na chemical concentration profile can propagate, producing\nmacroscopically visible expanding concentric circles or spi-\nrals.\nIn biology, although symmetry breaking is ubiquitous,\nunderstanding the mechanisms involved has met with\nlimited success. Embryogenesis is a paradigm of pattern\nformation in nature and is still poorly understood. What\nmakes the heart localize to the left and the liver to the\nright? In development the heart does not remain a mid-\nline structure; nature makes a choice between left and\nright and the axial symmetry is broken. The correct out-\ncome is not always guaranteed \u2013 witness dextrocardia \u2013\nbut there are extremely robust mechanisms in place to\nensure such anomalies are rare. In some cases, symmetry\nbreaking may not occur where it should; an example is\nthe uniformly pigmented zebra, or it may occur where it\nshould not; an example from human dermatology is the\nunilateral icthyosiform eruption found in the CHILD\nnaevus (2).\nWhat can be learnt from the study of pattern forma-\ntion in relatively simple physical systems, such as the\nBelusov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction, and how can such know-\nledge increase understanding of the more complex proces-\nses occurring in biology? First, inanimate systems can\nundergo a process of self-organization provided they\nexchange energy and\/or matter with their environment\n(3). Second, biological systems may exploit physical con-\nstraints, such as surface tension, to generate structure\nwithout the need for an explicit genetic message (4).\nFinally, the analogies between inanimate pattern forma-\ntion and biological pattern formation offer the tantalizing\nprospect that the latter may be approached and under-\nstood in a quantitative manner. Indeed, Alan Turing, the\nBritish mathematician, wrote down a series of reaction\u2013\ndiffusion equations in 1952 under the title \u2018The chemical\nbasis of morphogenesis\u2019 that show how chemicals that\nreact and diffuse can form spontaneous patterns in solu-\ntion (5). This is perhaps the simplest mathematical model\nthat can exhibit self-organization. As such, it should not\nbe interpreted in a literal sense, rather it should be con-\nsidered a paradigm model. Other models for self-organ-\nization have been proposed based on different biological\nhypotheses, but, intriguingly, many of these models make\nsimilar predictions, suggesting possible developmental\nconstraints which are independent of the exact details of\nthe biological processes involved (6). It is reaction\u2013diffu-\nsion theory that will be used here to explain symmetry\nbreaking in dermatology.\nConsider naevoid patterns. How do the patterns arise?\nThe answer remains unresolved despite many attempts at\nan explanation. Most authors have suggested that the\npatterns are due to the clonal outgrowth of abnormal\ncell lines during embryogenesis. For example, the mor-\nphology of quadrant naevi has been considered the result\nof a postzygotic mutation such that the destination of\nabnormal clones reflects the patterning (7). Similar argu-\nments have been applied to bathing trunk naevi.\nLikewise, the lines of Blaschko have usually been attrib-\nuted to clonal outgrowths of clones of cells either from\nthe primitive streak (8) or from the neural crest (9). Yet\nthere is evidence that suggests these explanations are\ninadequate. Lineage studies on embryonic mice show\nthat early postzygotic mutated cell clones become widely\ndispersed throughout the body; they do not remain\nlocalized (10). In humans, evidence supporting these\nresults is provided by studying the McCune\u2013Albright\nsyndrome, a genodermatosis thought to be due to a\npostzygotic mutation, and human chimaerism. Although\nboth conditions exhibit large patches of uniformly brown\nskin over a background of normal skin, it has been\nshown that fine-grained mosaicism is present throughout\nthe skin in the former (11), and present throughout all\ntissues studied in the latter (12). Patterns following the\nlines of Blaschko are occasionally observed in the McC-\nune\u2013Albright syndrome, but are more commonly seen in\nX-linked conditions where there is a random inactiva-\ntion, termed lyonization, of one of the X chromosomes\nin each cell early in embryogenesis. In contrast to the\nprevious example, it has been demonstrated that clonality\nmay exist in tissue specimens of lesions following the\nlines of Blaschko (9,13) despite the expectation that fine-\ngrained mosaicism secondary to lyonization should be\npresent. The issue is confounded by a lack of data. It is\nControversies\n557\nnot known whether lesional tissue from all naevi follow-\ning the lines of Blaschko is clonal. It is also unclear in\nsome naevi as to which cell types are involved, so the\nrelevant cell type may have been overlooked. Some\nauthors have suggested the lines of Blaschko may repre-\nsent the paths of migrating melanocytes (14,15), but this\nis unlikely. Mintz\u2019s allophenic mice (mosaic for black or\nwhite coat colour where the relevant genes are expressed\nby melanocytes) do not exhibit patterns that look like\nthe lines of Blaschko in humans (16). In addition, it is\ndifficult (although not impossible) to see how a gene\nexpressed by a melanocyte could cause, for example,\nthe blistering and hyperkeratosis seen in incontinentia\npigmenti.\nHere it is suggested that the patterning found in all\nnaevi, ranging from the simple to the complex, can be\naccounted for by assuming that they are secondary to\nchemical prepatterns laid down early in embryogenesis\n(Fig. 1) (17). A chemical prepattern is a spatially varying\nchemical concentration gradient that remains fixed. Its gen-\neration from uniformity is a striking example of symmetry\nbreaking and in the example shown it is produced by a\nreaction\u2013diffusion process. Given the presence of the pre-\npattern, there are three possible ways in which macroscopic\npattern can subsequently develop. First, when the concen-\ntration reaches a threshold, spatially dependent gene acti-\nvation may occur. It is then possible to see how the\nabnormal clone becomes activated in regions that follow\nthe prepattern. The distribution of the naevus over the skin\nwill be independent of the presence of the abnormal clone,\nbut not of the presence of the activated gene of the abnor-\nmal clone. Second, the prepattern may act as a chemo-\nattractant gradient for the abnormal clone (18). In naevi\nfollowing the lines of Blaschko abnormal clones may\naggregate as they migrate laterally within the surface ecto-\nderm [one ectodermal cell, as it proliferates and migrates\nlaterally cannot be expected to produce a macroscopic\nband with the exclusion of the normal cell type (19)].\nFinally, the chemical prepattern may be the trigger for a\nspatially dependent selective proliferation of one cell type\nover another. An interesting consequence of the chemical\nprepattern hypothesis is that the pattern-forming process\nitself may be pathological, so that in people unaffected by\nnaevoid skin disease the lines of Blaschko do not exist.\n(d) (e) (f)\n(a) (b) (c)\nFigure 1. The spontaneous generation of chemical concentra-\ntion patterns over the dorsum of the early human embryo.\nHere the evolution of the \u2018Brusselator\u2019 (22), a simple chemical\nscheme involving six distinct compounds, is modelled using\ntwo coupled non-linear partial differential equations and\nsolved using a finite element scheme over the domain as\nshown. This domain is a representation of the shape of the\nectodermal surface of the day 25 tri-laminar embryo (a)\u2013(e)\nand the day 24 embryo (f). The bottom quarter of the surface\nof the day 25 embryo is the region associated with the devel-\noping thoracic somites. In (a)\u2013(c), the temporal evolution of\npattern is shown culminating in a pattern resembling the nar-\nrow-banded lines of Blaschko. Images (d), (e) and (f) repre-\nsent, in the order of decreasing complexity, the broad banded\nlines of Blaschko, quadrant naevi and the unilateral CHILD\nnaevus, respectively.\n(a) (b)\n(d)(c)\n\u20132\nCo\nnc\nen\ntra\ntio\nn\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n0 2 4 6 8\nSpace\n10\nFigure 2. Modelling erythema gyratum repens. In (a) the one-\ndimensional solution to a reaction\u2013diffusion scheme is shown\n(21). This chemical concentration waveform is repeated end-\nto-end and propagates to the left with a speed of the order\n1 cm per day and with a wavelength approximately 1 cm. In\n(b)\u2013(d), the model shown in (a) is approximated by a cellular\nautomaton simulation known as the Hodgepodge machine\n(21,23). Note the morphology and evolution of the rash is\naccurately represented; the features include growing arcs, spi-\nrals and collision fronts.\nChuong et al.\n558\nNext consider erythema gyratum repens. Here a pattern-\nforming process must account for the appearance of the\nrash, including expanding rings and spirals, and collision\nfronts, as well as its dynamic evolution. Hitherto, the rapid\nspread of the bands of inflammatory skin across the skin\nsurface (up to 1 cm per day) has defied explanation. Some\nauthors have suggested it is due to diffusion, but a simple\ncalculation shows that the rate of diffusion for even small\nmacromolecules is orders of magnitude too small (17). Once\nagain, consider the chemical prepattern hypothesis as a\npossible solution to the problem. In contrast to the station-\nary patterns described above, in this case, the chemical gra-\ndient is a wave that propagates across the skin surface.\nMany features of the rash, including its morphology and\nrapid evolution, emerge naturally as a consequence of this\nreaction\u2013diffusion mechanism (Fig. 2) (20,21).\nHere the concept of symmetry breaking found in\ndynamical systems theory is applied to pattern formation\nin some examples of human skin disease. Although as yet\nunproven, the mathematics show that the mechanisms are\nphysically well founded. Quantitative approaches to the\nproblem of pattern formation in skin disease result in fal-\nsifiable predictions and offer the prospect of new and\ncounterintuitive insights into pathogenesis.\nStephen Gilmore\nDepartment of Medicine (Dermatology)\nUniversity of Melbourne\nMelbourne, Vic.\nAustralia\nand\nCentre for Mathematical Biology\nUniversity of Oxford\nOxford\nUK\nE-mail: sjgilmore@bigpond.com\nPhilip Maini\nCentre for Mathematical Biology\nUniversity of Oxford\nOxford\nUK\nReferences\n1.

Every organ in the body har-\nbours pattern, the most obvious being observed in skin.\nEmbryonic and postnatal development results in three dis-\ntinct steps in skin patterning.\nSkin patterns belong to three main types,\ndetermined at three steps of embryonic and\npostnatal development\nFirst, humans are vertebrates that harbour a bilateral,\ndorsoventral and right\/left symmetry; they are character-\nized by a dorsal location of neural tube, and a metamer-\nism resulting from the segmentation of the paraxial\nmesoderm; all together determined at a very early stage of\ndevelopment. The mesodermal segmentation forms the\nsomites, which give rise not only to the vertebrae, but also\nto segmented dorsal dermis progenitors, as well as striated\nmuscle progenitors, the latter migrating all over the entire\nbody. Thus, at this first stage, the formation of different\ncell lineages or clones takes place. Moreover, the neural\nroots emerging at the intervertebral level also show such a\nmetamerism and their distinct innervating territories are\nwell known from the physicians.\nDuring mid-embryonic stages, the establishment of\ncutaneous underlying muscles, nerves and blood vessels\npattern, as well as the arrival by migration of melanocyte\nprogenitors, occurs. Almost concomitantly, the primarily\nhomogeneous skin becomes heterogeneous, leading to the\nformation of cutaneous appendage displaying characteris-\ntic patterns, like hair follicles, sebaceous, sweat or mam-\nmary glands.\nFinally, during postnatal life, endogenous hormonal\nevents like sexual hormones or lack of insulin, which\nControversies\n559\nare genetically dependent on conception or can also\ndepend in the second case on alimentary behaviour, as\nwell as environmental events because of radiations,\nmicrobiological or wounding injuries might create or let\nout pre-existing skin patterns.\nSuch patterns have for a long time attracted the atten-\ntion of dermatologists not only as they might help them in\ndisease diagnosis, but also by the intriguing fact that they\nappear to follow some rules and did not simply form by\naccident. Adult, normal or pathological patterns might\nreflect or be the consequence of pre-existing patterns\nestablished during embryogenesis. During development,\nmolecular signals occur between the mesoderm, or the\nmigrating neural crest and their environment, like the\nneural tube, as well as between the forming dermis and\nepidermis. Some patterning events, which appear auton-\nomous, are the results of physical diffusion of molecular\nsignals. Moreover, new adult patterning might be the con-\nsequence of adult interactions with underlying muscles or\neven bones, patterning of which have been established\nduring embryogenesis.\nBiological patterning is a highly interesting mathemat-\nical topic which implies the understanding of shape cre-\nation, periodicity and symmetry breaking. We are\nconvinced that physical and mathematical approaches\nmight help skin pattern understanding. While skin pat-\nterns have been studied in some cases, they still deserve\nnew interest as new results have been obtained in develop-\nmental biology.\n(1) Skin macropattern is determined during\nearly embryogenesis and is related to the\nestablishment of body axes and body regions\nSkin macropattern in mammals can be mainly distin-\nguished as head, dorsal\/ventral trunk, mammary, plantar\nand palm regions, all of them being linked to the estab-\nlishment of anterior\u2013posterior and dorsal\u2013ventral axes,\nshowing a bilateral symmetry. Experiments have been\nmostly performed in chick and mice embryos. Skin clo-\nnal lineages have been analysed in b-galactosidase trans-\ngenic mice displaying an abnormal duplication in the\nLacZ gene, leading to the formation of a non-functional\nenzyme (1). The rare occurrence of homologous recom-\nbination leads to the formation of clones of b-galactosi-\ndase expressing cells that in skin forms lines on each\nside of the mid-dorsal line (Fig. 1a). A late occurrence\nof such an event can allow us to identify cell lineages\noccurring from the base of the hair matrix in hair fol-\nlicle (Fig. 1b).\nLikewise, local transgenesis in early chick embryo by\nmeans of replication defective virus that expresses b-galac-\ntosidase showed blue lines radiating from the midline\nacross the dorsal skin (2). Thus, Blaschko\u2019s lines (3,4) may\ncorrespond to a clinical expression of a genetically altered\nclone that forms during early embryogenesis. They may\nalso correspond to the segmented pathways of sensory\nskin nerves as some lesions such as herpes zoster may be\nmanifested along a nerve domain.\nAt early embryogenesis stage, the Hox code along the\nanterior\u2013posterior axis of the trunk, as well as along the\nproximal\u2013distal axis of the limb, is expressed not only in\nthe mesoderm, but also in the skin progenitors and is\nresponsible for the future skin regional identities (5).\nLikewise, homeobox genes exhibit spatial changes in\nexpression during human skin development (6).\nThe specification of dermal progenitors and their\nmigration in the sub-ectodermal space (7,8) depend on\nintercellular interactions with their environment, which are\nmediated mainly by Wnts, Shh and Noggin. Skin field for-\nmation, i.e. skin macropattern, also depends on epidermal\ncompetence. The complex formation of a feathered skin,\nwhich can be triggered even in chick extra-embryonic area\n(8), results from a basic genetic ectodermal programme.\nThe simplest formation of a scaled skin requires the\nfeather program inhibition, which occurs before 8.5 days\nof development in the chick hind limb (9). Likewise, the\nchoice between foot dorsal pelage and plantar skin in mice\n(10) or between foot dorsal scutate and ventral reticulate\nskin in chick (11) depends on En1 expression in the ecto-\nderm at the limb bud stage. Another related question\nrelies on the pattern of pigmentation of the hand and foot\nof black people, a pattern that exactly corresponds to the\ndorsal and ventral regions of the autopode, which are spe-\ncified at an early stage of limb bud morphogenesis. Why\ndoes the migration of neural crest cells giving rise to mel-\nanocytes not cross the dorsal\/ventral border? In fact, an\nincreased expression of Dickkopf1 by palmar and plantar\nfibroblasts inhibits melanocyte growth and differentiation\n(12).\nMany dermatological questions that appear to be rela-\nted to those early embryogenesis events remain unresolved.\nThe giant child naevus may exhibit a clear-cut pattern cor-\nresponding with the mid-ventral line (13). The pattern of\nhuman male alopecia frequently spares the occipital\nregion. Intriguingly, its dermis originates from the paraxial\nnon-segmented mesoderm, while both the frontal and pari-\netal dermis are issued from the neural crest (14). How\nmight those different origins be related to a dramatic dif-\nference in their respective sensibility to testosterone? It\nshould be noted that hair follicles of a region, of which\nidentity is known for a long time to be defined by the der-\nmis (15), are developmentally programmed to respond to\nhormonal stimulation, as they kept those properties when\ntransplanted (16). Another still unresolved question con-\ncerns the pattern of the mammary line. The presence of\n(a) (b)\nFigure 1. Skin clonal lineages in mouse embryo dorsal skin\n(a) and hair follicle (b). By courtesy from J. F. Nicolas.\nChuong et al.\n560\nabnormal supernumerary nipples in humans always fol-\nlows the primary line, which has been established at an\nearly stage of development. What exactly is the origin of\nthe mammary dermis? What are the signals responsible for\nits specification? Moreover, for each skin field the follow-\ning question arises: what triggers the appearance of the\nfirst cutaneous appendage primordium? Most of the time,\nthe first primordia in chick skin are arranged in one first\nrow parallel to the anterior\/posterior axis of the trunk or\nthe proximal\/distal axis of the limb. Moreover, in the lat-\nter case, the first scutate scales appear over the foot bone\njoints (17). This general rule presents exceptions, charac-\nterized by a circular or a whirl appearance of the primor-\ndia, from a centre point. This is often observed on the top\nof the human scalp. Experimentally, the loss of Frizzled 6\n(a receptor of a Wnt family signal) leads to the formation\nof multiple whirls in transgenic mice (18). This is also the\ncase when a supernumerary feather field is induced in the\nprospective area of the chick mid-ventral apterium (i.e.\nnude skin) by the graft of a clump of Noggin or Shh pro-\nducing cells (8).\nFinally, all the questions related to the early establish-\nment of skin macropattern may deserve to be studied on a\nmathematical point of view, which has not yet been the\ncase, in contrast with the skin micropattern.\n(2) Skin micropattern: Biomathematical\nexplanations of the formation of cutaneous\nappendage and pigment motifs during\nmid-embryogenesis\nCutaneous appendage primordial, composed of a placode\nand a dermal condensation form during mid-embryogen-\nesis, is a step of development characterized by the trans-\nformation of a homogeneous skin into a heterogeneous\nskin. In chick embryo, the feather micropattern is hexag-\nonal, corresponding to the best filling of space. Once\ntriggered by a Wnt dermal signalling [among others:\n(19\u201321)], the placode formation, which requires Eda\/Edar\nsignalling (19) and precedes that of the dermal condensa-\ntion, becomes autonomous (F. Michon, unpublished\nresults). It should be noted that mutations of Eda or\nEdar genes affect not only the formation of hair follicles,\nbut also of sweat glands and teeth as shown in several\nectodermal dysplasia (22). Numerous dermal\u2013epidermal\ninteractive signals comprising diffusible (among others:\nBMPs, Wnts, Shh) or trans-membrane signals (Notch\nsystem) are then involved in primordia maintenance and\ndifferentiation [for a review, see Ref. (23)]. Another\nunresolved question is the patterning of cutaneous nerves\nand blood vessels: prior to or consequence of the skin\nmicropattern?\nSkin micropattern provides a very suitable application\nof the most known theory of the biomathematics: reac-\ntion\u2013diffusion. Some precursors are Kolmogorov and\nRashevsky (24,25), but this theory was clearly developed\nby Alan Turing (26). In this framework, two substances,\nat least, u and v are considered. These substances evolve\nspatiotemporally according to diffusion and reaction. Sub-\nstances are represented by their concentration u(x,t) and\nv(x,t) which depend on space (variable x) and time (vari-\nable t). The temporal variation \u00b6u\/\u00b6t and \u00b6v\/\u00b6t at each\npoint x, of these concentrations are ruled by a partial dif-\nferential equation (Eqn 1):\n@u\n@t \u00bc DuDu\u00fe f\u00f0u; v\u00de\n@v\n@t \u00bc DvDv\u00fe g\u00f0u; v\u00de\n\u0001\n\u00f01\u00de\nIn Eqn 1, DuDu (resp. DvDv) is the diffusion term for\nu (resp. v) and f(u,v) (resp. v) is the reaction term of\nu (resp. v), accounting for their kinetics of production,\ndegradation, etc. Du and Dv are the diffusion constants for\nu and v, respectively. Turing has demonstrated the capa-\ncity of this system to generate symmetry breaking from an\ninitial homogeneous concentration only perturbed by\nsmall random perturbations (typical of a living organism).\nThis system is able, under some conditions notably on dif-\nfusion constants and on capacity to amplify small pertur-\nbations, to generate stable non-uniform concentration\npatterns in space. Substances u and v are called \u2018morpho-\ngens\u2019 by Turing because of their supposed ability to gener-\nate order and form. This theory is inspired by some\nconcepts of Waddington who insisted on the importance\nof global factors (epigenetic), called \u2018evocators\u2019, in the\nestablishment of form and order in biology (27). Turing\nformalism was intensely applied to various biological\nexamples. Reference works presenting a wide class of\napplications of reaction\u2013diffusion in biology are those of\nMeinhardt and Murray (28\u201331). Terms were added in\nsome cases in the equations to generalize the original\nmodel and for taking chemotactic effects into account.\nWhen considering the interaction between a chemical and\na cell population, cell movements are preferentially orien-\nted to the high concentration value of the chemical (32).\nIn the case of pure diffusion no privileged direction is\ndetermined. If chemotaxis steps in, the cellular flux\nincludes a chemotactic term that depends on the gradient\nof the guiding substance. The most studied application of\nreaction\u2013diffusion is far from skin patterning.\nWith respect to cutaneous appendages patterning, the\nreaction\u2013diffusion theory relies on the biological existence\nof various activators and inhibitors of cutaneous append-\nage formation. This theory has been developed with\nrespect to feather hexagonal pattern by C. M. Chuong\nlaboratory (33,34), and considers BMP2 and follistatin as\nbeing, respectively, the leading inhibitor and activator pro-\nteins.\nHowever, is this theory, declined with some variations\nof functions and parameters, able to explain all the differ-\nent skin micropatterns? How, for example, could the triad\npattern of pelage hair follicle be explained? Moreover,\nhow could the wide and intriguing variety of pigmented\npatterns be explained? The introduction of morphogen\nkinetics (activators and\/or inhibitors) also permits us to\nobtain spots and stripes and to control the pattern regu-\nlarity by playing with interactions between morphogens, in\nparticular with their non-linearity of allosteric type (in\nwhich we can tune the cooperative and allosteric coeffi-\ncients) or competitive type (Michaelian or Meinhardt kin-\netics). It was spectacularly adapted for the generation of\nstripe (tiger, zebra, etc.) and spot patterns (hexagonal\nspots of a cheetah, less structured spot pattern of a gir-\naffe). Modelling of spots and stripes uses either a diffu-\nsion\u2013reaction system (35) or a non-Turing system like the\nPotts model (36). In these last models, condensation\nresults from random cell diffusion biased by preferential\nattachment of cells to extracellular matrix (ECM) and\nenhanced local cell\u2013cell adhesion. In the reaction\u2013diffusion\napproach, bifurcation schemes to spatial patterns in two-\nControversies\n561\ndimensional reaction\u2013diffusion medium are considered\n(35), showing, for example, that the selection of stripes\nversus spots depends on the non-linear terms and cannot\nbe discerned from the linearized model. The absence of\nquadratic terms in the reaction leads to stripes, but in\nmost common models quadratic terms will lead to spot\npatterns (35). Studies have also shown that the size and\nthe shape of the geometry have a great influence on the\nsolution of the equation. A general trend is that the same\nequation, with the same parameters can produce different\npatterns that can then be studied in terms of size: mice\nand elephants do not have any pattern, angelfish are stripy\nand cheetahs are spotty. One hypothesis for the difference\nof pattern between cheetah and tiger, both similar in size,\nwould be the size of the embryo at the stage of formation\nof the pigmented pattern. This provides an explication of\nthe difference of pattern in one species between its spotty\nbody and its stripy tail. The cheetah has spots on its body\nand a spotty (at the start) and stripy tail depending on its\ndiameter \u2013 but it is not possible for a stripy animal to\nhave a spotted tail (Fig. 2). In cheetahs, a progressive\nchange appears on the tail from spot to stripe as the diam-\neter of the tail decreases (Fig. 2a). When the spots are\nlarge, as in the case of the nebulous panther (Fig. 2b),\nstripes appear rapidly on the tail. Reversely, according to\nthe trends of equation comportment with size, it is not\npossible for a stripy animal to have a spotty tail (Fig. 2c).\nThe adequacy of the reaction\u2013diffusion system was also\nstudied in growing organisms (37). For instance, angelfish\nexhibit observed changes in the number, size and orienta-\ntion of their stripes while growing. It should be noted that\nsome pigmented patterns do not seem to rely on the reac-\ntion\u2013diffusion family, such as some black and white pat-\nterns, which just present a global axial symmetry and no\nmicropattern (many examples may be found in birds or\ncats). In those cases, pattern may only be due to early\nembryonic movements of groups of melanocyte progeni-\ntors from the neural crest and should be related to the first\nstep of patterning during development. Finally, the wide\nvariety in skin micropattern is a challenge to mathemati-\ncians and to the reaction\u2013diffusion formalism.\n(3) Skin patterns related to adult life\nMany adult skin patterns that are linked with various dis-\neases let out pre-existing patterning that has been estab-\nlished during early embryogenesis, in relation with the\nunderlying tissues or organs. However, new patterns may\noccur during postnatal life, for example ulcers, eschar or\nwound healing. Those patterns again are related to the\nskin underlying muscles or bones. Prevention of skin\nlesions may be achieved by respecting local characteristics.\nDuring the past century, guidelines developed by surgeons\nhave searched for elective opening incisions. Many sur-\ngeons prefer Langer\u2019s lines (Fig. 3a) developed by Karl\nLanger from cadavers in rigor mortis (38,39). These lines\ncorrespond roughly to empirical minimal stretch and con-\ntraction lines by looking both at the local dermal tension\n(essentially because of elastic fibres) and at the loco-regio-\nnal tendon\u2013muscular action. Other surgeons (40) pre-\nferred lines oriented perpendicular to the action of the\nunderlying muscles. More recently, Borges (41) described\nrelaxed skin tension lines, which follow furrows formed\nwhen the skin is relaxed and are produced by pinching the\nskin. In Fig. 3b, arrows are oriented along the relaxed skin\ntension lines. Linear scars following the arrows are minim-\nally noticeable. Their location may vary slightly among\nindividuals. Borges\u2019s and Kraissl\u2019s lines are considered by\nsome surgeons as the better guides for elective incisions of\nthe face and body, respectively. Elastic fibres underlying\nLanger\u2019s lines are parallel or perpendicular to the epider-\nmis, while they are perpendicular to Kraissl\u2019s and Borges\u2019s\nlines. Langer\u2019s lines also partly follow Blaschko\u2019s lines\n(3,4), corresponding to zones of eruption of herpes zoster\ncorrelated with dermatomes.\nNumerous authors (42,43) have suggested that trau-\nmatic or surgical wound healing follows reaction\u2013diffusion\nmodels. Applications of the simulation results in such\nmodelling are important in surgery and traumatology.\nThis gives a rational basis to the use of the empirical sur-\ngical lines networks mentioned above, helping in particular\nthe surgeon to avoid cheloids, which are observed after\neither traumatic wounds or surgical openings. For\n(a) (b) (c)\nFigure 2. Skin spotting and stripping in the big cats: cheetah (a), nebulous panther (b) and white tiger (c).\n(a) (b)\nFigure 3. Two cases of empirical surgical lines networks:\nLanger\u2019s lines (a) and the best surgical opening incisions in\nthe case of face (b).\nChuong et al.\n562\ninstance, both aesthetic and functional results of the heal-\ning process are highly dependent on the original orienta-\ntion of the primitive cuts.\nThe master equations corresponding to the modelling\nof wound healing are given in the framework of differen-\ntial systems and can be summarized as follows, where\nn(x,t) [resp. r(x,t)] is the cell (resp. ECM) density in a spa-\ntial point x at time t and u(x,t) [resp. \u00b6u(x,t)\/\u00b6t] is the dis-\nplacement (resp. the velocity) of the ECM with respect to\nthe fixed x referential:\n1.

The displacement equation synthesizes the balance\nof the forces exerted on the ECM that are responsible\nfor its displacement. We summarized these different com-\nponents responsible for the cell and ECM dynamics in\nFig. 4. The parameters of the above equations are the\ncell diffusion coefficient D, the proliferation rate r, the\nhaptotaxis coefficient h, the maximal cell density N, the\nsecretion rate k, the catabolism rate k\u00a2, the Young coeffi-\ncient E, the Poisson coefficient b, the viscosity coefficient\nl, the cell traction amplitude d and the restoring force\ncoefficient r.\nSuch a general model has to be simplified to simulate\nlines networks like those described by Langer or Blaschko,\nkeeping only, in the above equations, the diffusion and\nproliferation terms in the first equation, the biosynthesis\nand degradation terms in the second equation, and the vis-\ncosity, elasticity and cell traction stress terms in the third\nequation. The main difficulties lie in estimating initial con-\nditions for the variable r: they have to take into account\nall viscid\u2013elastic forces related both to dermal and muscu-\nlar tensions and the present anatomic atlases are only giv-\ning data about the general direction of muscle contraction.\nAn interesting challenge, especially for reconstructive sur-\ngery, would be now to obtain a precise functional atlas\ngiving the local mean values of the parameters appearing\nin the simplified model.\nIn conclusion, the history of the major morphogenetic\nequations in mathematics has been often pushed by the\nnecessity of explaining complex life\u2019s forms, especially\nthose occurring in the skin wound healing, skin annex\ndevelopment and skin pigmentation patterning.\nLoic Forest and Jacques Demongeot\nLaboratoire Techniques de l\u2019Imagerie\nde la Mode\u00b4lisation et de la Cognition\nUMR CNRS 5525\nLa Tronche\nFrance\nFrederic Michon, Se\u00b4bastien Cadau and Danielle Dhouailly\nEquipe Biologie de la Diffe\u00b4renciation Epithe\u00b4liale\nUMR CNRS 5538\nUniversite\u00b4 Joseph Fourier\nLa Tronche\nFrance\nE-mail: danielle.dhouailly@ujf-grenoble.fr\nReferences\n1.
