These were perceived as direct damage to foliage following deposition from \nthe atmosphere. More recently, the debate on \u2018acid rain\u2019 in the 1970s and 1980s, \nparticularly in Europe, led to hypotheses that attributed damage to trees through the \nacidification of forest soils, rather than a direct effect on foliage (Schulze et al., 1989). \nResponses to airborne pollutants were often interpreted in terms of nutrient \nimbalances caused by leaching of one or more essential metals (e.g. calcium, \nmagnesium) from the rooting zones of forest soils. Nutrient imbalances are \nexacerbated by increased deposition of nitrogen, although its influence has also been \nimplicated in an observed increase in stem growth and timber yield (Spiecker, 1999). \nThe effects of photo-oxidants on trees, with ozone and PAN (peroxyacetyl nitrate) as \nparticular gaseous pollutants, were recognised in the 1960s with the seminal studies in \nsouthern California and later throughout the USA (Karnosky et al., 2007a, Miller and \nMcBride, 1999). Observed symptoms were largely ascribed to direct damage relating \nto foliar uptake by the tree canopy. \n \nAlthough air pollution in much of Europe and North America is now less severe than \nin the 1980s (Cape et al., 2003, Lehmann et al., 2005), as a result of legislation to \nreduce emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and the ozone precursors, nitrogen oxides \n(NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the threat to forests from air pollution \ncaused by the rapid industrialisation of other parts of the world (e.g. China, India) is a \nregional issue that translates the problems of last century in Europe and North \nAmerica to different tree species and different climatic regimes in this century \n(Emberson et al., 2001). However, even in the areas where emissions of the primary \npollutants (SO2, NOx, VOCs) have been controlled by legislation and changing fuel \ntypes, the threat from secondary air pollutants has not been removed. \u2018Acid rain\u2019 and \nozone are the most studied secondary pollutants, as far as forest effects are concerned, \nand while amounts of wet-deposited acidity (and sulphate and nitrate) have decreased, \nthere are still large areas of Europe and North America that exceed the Critical Loads \nfor forests (Hettelingh et al., 1995). Moreover, the increasing industrialisation of \nIndia, China and south-east Asia is leading to a gradual increase in the \u2018background\u2019 \nconcentrations of ozone across the northern hemisphere, with several studies \ndemonstrating that long-range (intercontinental) transport of ozone and\/or its \nprecursors is affecting annual average ozone concentrations across the whole \nhemisphere (Auvray and Bey, 2005, Derwent et al., 2006, Jaffe et al., 2003, Jonson et \nal., 2006, Oltmans et al., 2006, Vingarzan, 2004). This gradual increase in \n\u2018background\u2019 ozone is set against a pattern of decreasing severity of peak ozone \nconcentrations during episodes, which can be attributed to the effects of emission \ncontrols, particularly on VOCs (Derwent et al., 2003). The predicted increase in \n\u2018background\u2019 ozone concentrations may be offset to some extent by climatic changes \nthat are forecast to occur over similar time scales (decades). In particular, increased \ntemperatures will lead to higher emissions of biogenic VOCs and larger water vapour \nconcentrations in the atmosphere, which have opposing effects on the formation of \nozone. The overall changes that can be attributed to the interactions between climate \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n66 \n67 \n68 \n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \nand emissions have been studied in a global model by comparing the results of a \nmodel with fixed climate over the period 1990-2030 with results from a model with a \nvarying climate (Stevenson et al., 2005), using the scenario of \u2018Current Legislation\u2019 to \ndefine precursor emissions. The overall conclusion was that climate-chemistry \ninteractions as regards ozone formation appear to be largely negative, but year-to-year \nvariability caused by changes in circulation patterns (e.g. ENSO) were at least as large \nas the variability in ozone that could be attributed either to changes in emissions or \nchanges in climate. Increasing carbon dioxide concentrations may also influence \nbiogenic VOC emissions (Pegoraro et al., 2005), but too little is known as yet to make \nquantitative predictions on a global scale. \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n \n \nPhotochemical reactions of primary pollutants, including both anthropogenic and \nbiogenic VOCs, lead to the formation of airborne particulates, adding to the burden of \nparticulates emitted directly from combustion processes. Fine particulates, particularly \nthose in the respirable size range (diameter < 10 \u03bcm, PM10), have been associated \nwith effects on human health (Englert, 2004), and reductions in visibility (Brewer and \nAdlhoch, 2005), but the potential effects of fine particulates on vegetation have \nreceived little experimental attention. Most studies on potential effects of airborne \nparticulates have focussed on larger particles (soot, dust) from combustion or \nmechanical generation in quarries etc. which can occlude stomata or in extreme cases \nphysically cover leaf surfaces and exclude light (Farmer, 1993, Grantz et al., 2003). \nReductions in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) on a regional scale in China, \nand consequent decreases in plant growth, have been attributed to the formation of \nfine particulates (ammonium sulphates and nitrate) in the atmosphere (Chameides et \nal., 1999, Liang and Xia, 2005), but there is little information on potential direct \neffects on trees and other vegetation. However, the impact of particulates on forests \nmay not be totally negative \u2013 one study suggests that although total irradiance may be \nattenuated by fine particulates, diffuse irradiance may be enhanced, leading to a net \nincrease in photosynthesis (Misson et al., 2005). \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n \nThis paper expands upon ideas presented to an international conference on the \nimpacts of air pollution and climate change on forest ecosystems, held in Riverside, \nCalifornia in 2006 (Cape, 2007). Two aspects of secondary air pollution are \ndiscussed: (1) the interaction of ozone and biogenic VOCs, in terms of affecting the \nbiogenic production of VOCs and their subsequent rates of oxidation, and the \npotential consequential effects on forest ecosystems, and (2) the potential effects of \nfine particulates on forests. \n \nOzone and biogenic VOCs \nIn the context of a slow but apparently inexorable increase in hemispheric ozone \nconcentrations (see above), the potential for direct effects of ozone on forest trees is of \ncontinuing concern. Whereas the observed effects on Ponderosa pine and other \nconifers in California were associated with peak ozone concentrations that exceeded \n200 nl l-1 (ppbv) (Miller and McBride, 1998), more recent studies have emphasised \nthe overall increase in ozone concentrations outside major \u2018episodes\u2019, and the \npotential for chronic injury (Coyle et al., 2003). There have been successful \nexperiments that have moved from the study of young trees (seedlings or saplings) in \nthe laboratory to the field-scale fumigation of adult trees with ozone, recognising that \nthe responses of small, immature plants in a controlled chamber environment may not \nbe a good predictor of effects on forest trees growing in situ (Karnosky et al., 2007b, \nMatyssek et al., 2007). This recognition of the importance of studying trees in the \ncontext of their normal environment is a step towards thinking about potential effects \non the forest ecosystem as a whole and not just the major tree species that are the most \nobvious components. Well-replicated field-scale experiments that recreate forest \nconditions are beginning to provide information on the effects of ozone (and carbon \ndioxide) on more than just trees (Percy et al., 2003). \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n \nForest ecosystems, like other vegetation communities, rely on complex interactions \nabove and below ground, with a myriad of life forms, from epiphytic micro-organisms \non leaf surfaces (the phyllosphere) to the soil bacteria and fauna that process decaying \nplant material in the soil \u2013 and everything in between (Figure 1). One of the primary \neffects of ozone in plants is to interfere with signalling processes within the plant \n(Evans et al., 2005), with consequences for the movement of water, nutrients and \nphotosynthate between root and shoot. However, there are other signalling processes \nthat operate between plant and plant, and between plant and animal, both atmospheric \nand in the soil, and these may also be affected by exposure to ozone and other photo-\noxidants. In this context, it must be remembered that ozone is only one component of \na photochemically active atmosphere, that happens to be reasonably easily measured \u2013 \nenhanced ozone concentrations are associated with greater free radical concentrations, \ne.g. hydroxyl (OH) and nitrate (NO3) radicals, which also have the potential to \ninterfere with biological processes (Cape, 1997).  \n \nBiogenic VOCs (BVOCs) have been recognised as a component of natural \nundisturbed plant communities for several decades, although their physiological and \necological roles, and the factors that control their emissions, are only now becoming \nbetter understood. VOCs are energy-rich molecules, and production within a plant is \nan expensive use of photosynthate. There has been considerable debate as to their role \n(Holopainen, 2004, Kesselmeier and Staudt, 1999, Sharkey and Yeh, 2001), whether \ninside the leaf (possibly acting to remove reactive oxygen species), or outside the leaf, \nas signalling molecules. There is evidence for several different external roles, such as \nsignalling herbivory, attracting predators of herbivores, or triggering defence \nresponses in neighbouring plants (Ashmore, 2005, Du et al., 1998, Engelberth et al., \n2004). Herbivory has been shown to stimulate release of mono- and sesquiterpenes \n(e.g. ocimene, linalool, farnesene) in crop plants (Pare and Tumlinson, 1999), and the \nmonoterpenes \u03b1- and \u03b2-pinene and \u03b4-3-carene from conifers (Litvak et al., 1999). \nEven though the ecological roles of such molecules are not fully understood, the \nrecent discovery that such biogenic molecules are chiral (i.e. are produced in a left-\nhanded or right-handed form) suggests an evolved specificity for their role as a \nsignalling agent that is different for tropical and Boreal forests (Williams et al., 2007). \nExposure to ozone and other oxidants has been shown to stimulate emissions of \nsignalling molecules (Heiden et al., 1999), presumably because the type of damage \ncaused mimics attack by herbivores or similar mechanical damage (Langebartels et \nal., 2002). However, there may also be enhanced emissions of VOCs from forest \ncanopies in response to ozone that have a chemical rather than biological source \n(Fruekilde et al., 1998) with no obvious ecological role. \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n \nMany biogenic VOCs that act as signalling molecules (examples are shown in Figure \n2) contain double bonds that are susceptible to attack by ozone and oxidant free \nradicals, and their role as signalling agents presumably evolved in atmospheres with \nmarkedly less ozone than at present, or likely to be seen in the near future. What are \nthe implications of increased oxidant concentrations in the atmosphere? A selection of \nreaction rates is presented in Table 1, which shows the lifetime with respect to \noxidation by ozone under pre-industrial, current day, and possible future scenarios, \nand for comparison, the current lifetime relative to OH radical during daylight (based \non a nominal 12 h daytime concentration).  \n181 \n182 \n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n \nIt is significant that no data exist for one of the more important of the recognised \nsignalling molecules, E-\u03b2-farnesene, although \u03b1-farnesene is reported to be more \nreactive than monoterpenes (Joutsensaari, 2005). The decreased lifetime of such \nmolecules as ozone concentrations increase implies a shorter dispersion path in the \natmosphere and a reduction in the spatial effectiveness of the signalling. Despite the \npossibility that ozone (and other oxidants) might interfere with atmospheric signalling \nprocesses (Vuorinen et al., 2004), there is also limited evidence that less reactive \nbiogenic VOCs may act as signalling molecules, and be relatively unaffected by \noxidants (Pinto et al., 2007). Similarly, the effects of ozone on the production of \nsignalling molecules may not require an atmospheric pathway, but may nevertheless \nhave a direct influence on herbivore behaviour (Mondor et al., 2004). \n \nPotential direct effects of ozone and other oxidant air pollutants below canopy, \nwhether on flora or fauna, have not been clearly established from field measurements, \npartly because of interactions with sunlight penetration, water and nutrient supply, and \nthe lower air concentrations of pollutant gases below the canopy than above \n(Krzyzanowski, 2004). However, there is some evidence of air pollutant effects on the \nunderstorey (Allen et al., 2007). The role of other oxidants, such as the nitrate radical \n(NO3), under the low-light conditions below forest canopies, has still to be explored in \ndetail (Cape, 2002). \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n \nThe challenge is for more research to investigate the ecological impacts of the effects \nof ozone and associated oxidants on signalling processes between different \ncomponents of forest ecosystems. \n \nSecondary aerosol particles \nThe oxidation of biogenic VOCs can be an important first step in the generation of \nsecondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles (Joutsensaari et al., 2005, Rohr et al., \n2007), a process that has long been associated with forests, leading to the \ncharacteristic \u2018blue haze\u2019 observed over forested areas. Reactions with sesquiterpenes \n(e.g. farnesene) are particularly rapid, leading to depletion of the BVOC and \ngeneration of SOA within the forest canopy (Lunden et al., 2006). The initial \nformation of SOA, with diameters of 10 nm or less, leads to the eventual formation of \nlarger particles, through coalescence, until the \u2018accumulation mode\u2019 is reached, with \ndiameters up to 1000 nm. This size range of particles is only slowly removed from the \natmosphere by turbulent deposition, and consequently can be long-lived, travelling \nlong distances in the atmosphere. The continuing oxidation of SOA leads to \nprogressively more polar functional groups, and an increasing affinity of the SOA \nparticles for water, which condenses and enhances the particle size, leading to faster \ndeposition rates. Increased oxidation rates, from higher oxidant concentrations, and \nincreased emissions of BVOCs (in response to ozone stress), can therefore lead to \nenhanced rates of formation of SOA, which in turn lead to a decrease in visible range \nand a direct contribution to the risk to human health of respirable particles in the PM1 \nto PM10 size range. Forests contribute to the \u2018background\u2019 PM concentrations, even in \nthe absence of other pollutant emissions, and may therefore contribute directly to the \nexceedance of regulatory thresholds for PM concentrations. \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n \nThe preceding section dealt with forests as a source of SOA, which contributes to \nparticulate matter in the atmosphere. Forests are also a sink for particulates, albeit \nrather inefficient (in terms of the deposition velocity) compared to the sink for \nreactive gases such as ozone and sulphur dioxide. However, in regions with high \natmospheric concentrations of ammonium salts (nitrates and sulphates) the deposition \nof nutrients to forest canopies as fine particulates cannot be ignored. For example, a \ndeposition velocity of 1 cm s-1, which is typical for fine particulate deposition to \nforests (Gallagher et al., 1997), and an air concentration of around 6 \u03bcg N m-3 as \nmeasured in parts of China (Aas et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2006) would give an annual \nN deposition greater than 15 kg ha-1, close to the Critical Load for forests used in \nEurope (Hettelingh et al., 1995) before any consideration of other atmospheric sources \nof N deposition, such as wet deposition or dry deposition of N-containing gases.  \n \nEven in areas with smaller air concentrations, however, the effects of particle \ndeposition to forests may be seen not simply in terms of nutrient input, but in terms of \nthe effects of such particles on the leaf surfaces of the canopy. Ammonium salts are \nhygroscopic, absorbing water vapour from the atmosphere to form solutions at \nrelative humidities (RH) well below saturation (100%). Pure ammonium sulphate is \nhygroscopic at 70% RH; mixtures of different ammonium salts are likely to become \nhygroscopic at lower RHs. Consequently, the deposition of ammonium salts on leaf \nsurfaces will lead to the generation of liquid water even in air which is unsaturated, \nleading to conditions similar to those which promote the formation of dew (Burkhardt \nand Eiden, 1994). Areas on leaf surfaces close to sources of water vapour (transpiring \nstomata) will remain \u2018wet\u2019 for longer than in the absence of the particle deposition. \nThis mechanism has been suggested as a possible explanation for increased water loss \nfrom forest canopies (Burkhardt, 1995) and enhanced deposition rates of water-\nsoluble gases (Cape, 1996), and may also be responsible for decreased CO2 uptake by \nleaf surfaces that stay wet for longer in the morning (Misson et al., 2005). Perhaps as \nimportant are the implications for biological activity on leaf surfaces exposed to \nammonium salts. Apart from the ready availability of N as a nutrient source for micro-\norganisms, enhanced periods with liquid water availability could lead to enhanced \nion-exchange and leaching across the leaf surface (Tukey, 1970), and may also affect \nthe deposition and reaction of ozone (Altimir et al., 2006). The more favourable \nconditions for micro-organism growth lead to increased risks of pathogen attack \n(Huber and Gillespie, 1992). Even in the absence of pathogenic activity, the \nproliferation of algae on a canopy that is well supplied with nitrogen and water may \nlead to situations where primary photosynthesis by the leaf is inhibited (Cape et al., \n1989). Certainly, the processing of nitrogen within forest canopies is still not well \ndescribed or understood \u2013 transformations from inorganic to organic forms can occur, \nand organic N can be retained within the canopy, either by epiphytic microbes or by \nthe leaf itself (Hill et al., 2005, Piirainen et al., 1998). In the latter case, the long-term \necological implications of a transfer of the pathway for N uptake from roots to \ncanopies (Rennenberg and Gessler, 1999), although recognised as a problem because \nof the changes in signalling hormones within the plant, have not been fully explored. \nSimilarly, changes in the chemical form of deposited N reaching the forest floor as \nthroughfall, interacting with understorey vegetation and entering the forest soil, have \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \nimplications for the storage and transport of N within and beyond the forest. Changes \nin the canopy may also affect leaf composition in a way that changes litter \ndecomposition rates (Magill and Aber, 2000), with further long-term implications for \nnutrient availability, accumulation and transport. \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n \nThe challenge is to understand the long-term implications of the deposition of \nhygroscopic fine particulates to forest canopies, in terms of leaf surface wetness, ion \nexchange, effects on epiphytic organisms, and nutrient pathways in the trees \nthemselves and also in the forest floor. \n \nConclusions \nSecondary air pollutants such as ozone and fine particulates are the products of \nchemical reactions in the atmosphere. The time taken for their production from \nprimary pollutant emissions means that they can be transported over long distances, \nand therefore can affect forests (and other types of vegetation) far from the original \npollution source. Although the direct effects on forest trees of ozone and other \nphotochemical oxidants has long been recognised, most studies have relied on \nexamination of the direct effects on the forest canopy. At much larger scales, studies \nof the potential effects of ozone on water status at the catchment (watershed) scale \n(McLaughlin et al., 2007) show the broader implications of ozone effects on forests. \nAlthough the interaction of ozone with biogenic VOCs, both in terms of effects on \nmolecular signalling, and SOA formation, have been identified, little is known \nquantitatively of the long-term ecological effects of increasing atmospheric oxidant \nconcentrations in forest ecosystems.  \n \nIncreased fine particle concentrations in the atmosphere, whether from combustion, or \nsecondary oxidation of inorganic pollutants or VOCs, have not been seen as a direct \nthreat to forests, except perhaps in relation to reduced photosynthesis because of light \nexclusion. However, the hygroscopic nature of fine particulate matter may have long-\nterm impacts on forest health because of the changed conditions (increased incidence \nof surface wetness) on canopy surfaces and consequent interactions with pathogens \nand other epiphytic organisms. The input of nutrients as fine particulate matter may \nalso be of importance in some regions, whether as direct input to the canopy, or \nthrough changing the composition of throughfall and input to the forest floor. \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n \n \nReferences \n \nAas, W., Shao, M., Jin, L., Larssen, T., Zhao, D.W., Xiang, R.J., Zhang, J.H., Xiao, \nJ.S., Duan, L., 2007.
