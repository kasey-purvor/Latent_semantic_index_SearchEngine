Piercy (2006) categorises this change as the emergence of the\nstrategic sales organization, where sales converges with marketing to take on greater\nstrategic significance to the organization. Harvard Business Review\u2019s special issue on\nsales (2006, Vol. 84 No. 7\/8) argued that sales is becoming a strategic activity in\nwhich the sale is made with the intention of building and maintaining a long-term\nrelationship. Thus, the salesperson is increasingly acting as a relationship manager\nrather than as the traditional order-taker.\nOur paper examines the change in the role of business-to-business sales, its functions\nand processes, through four case studies of organizations that have transformed their\nsales function and improved their performance as a result. This article is structured as\nfollows: first, we discuss literature relating to the changing role of sales, the\nconnection between sales strategy and business strategy, the demands on the sales\nprocess, and the interaction between sales and other functions of a firm. Second, we\ndescribe our research process and methodology. Third, findings from the case studies\nare described and discussed. Finally, we discuss the contribution of the article and\nidentify managerial implications and future research opportunities.\nThe role of sales\nBusiness-to-business marketing is increasingly identified with customer\ncommunication, branding, advertising, websites, point of sale materials etc. Sales, in a\n3business-to-business context, is increasingly associated with account management and\nsolution development. With the growth of online business-to-business order\nprocessing and replenishment, many transactions are now effectively managed by the\nmarketing or IT function. Thus, order-taking \u2013 traditionally a sales preserve \u2013 has\neffectively become a marketing or operational task. The number of customers placing\norders over the internet is dwarfed, however, by those who search for product\ninformation online before placing orders through other channels. In this way, the role\nof product knowledge and information specialist, formerly part of the salesperson\u2019s\nrole, has been transferred to marketing or customer service, where the management of\nthe website often resides.\nBy contrast, the sales function is increasingly taking on a relationship management\nrole. Perhaps the most noticeable manifestation of this in business-to-business selling\nis in the emergence of Key Account Management (KAM) or Strategic Account\nManagement (SAM) as a strategic sales activity, driven by issues such as increasingly\nsophisticated customers (McDonald et al., 2000), profit failures in manufacturing\n(Wise and Baumgartner, 1999) and commoditisation caused by short-termism\n(Lombardi, 2005). The key account manager has become custodian of the customer\nrelationship, pursuing consultative and solution selling activities. The role of the key\naccount manager is not just to sell new products and services but also to manage the\nongoing relationship, to co-ordinate delivery and customer service, and to oversee the\nprofitability (not just the revenues) of the relationship (McDonald et al.,2000).\nHowever, with the exception of the KAM area there has been little empirical work\nexploring the changing role of sales, particularly in respect of the increasingly\n4important role played by sales strategy. There are also implications for the sales\nprocess and, through this, for the interface of sales with other business functions.\nSales strategy and business strategy\nDarrell Zahorsky from About.com (e.g. New York Times Group) identifies sales\nstrategy as \u201cthe planning of sales activities: methods of reaching clients, competitive\ndifferences and resources available\u201d. This is similar to common definitions of\nmarketing planning (e.g. McDonald, 2007) and demonstrates the need for an internal\nperspective as well as external perspective in customer management.\nGosselin and Heene (2003) argue that, through a strategic interface with clients,\nchange should occur in the sales strategy itself. Homburg et al. (2000) even go on to\ndiscuss how these new sales strategies lead to organizational change. In its most\ncomplete form this would lead to corporate strategy placing full responsibility for\ncustomers (as the company\u2019s greatest asset) in the hands of salespeople, entrusting\nthem to act as arbiters of these assets (Ingram et al., 2002). In essence, the salesperson\nwould need the power to drive the activities in other functional areas and thus play a\nfundamental role in organization-wide strategy.\nThe vital role of sales as a strategic function of market-orientated organizations has\nbeen previously identified in the literature (Shapiro et al., 1994; Leigh and Marshall,\n2001). There is a growing body of research linking sales strategy and marketing\nstrategy. Thus, we see research highlighting the importance of aligning marketing\nstrategy and sales objectives (Strahle et al., 1996); how collaboration between\nmarketing and sales enhances business performance (Le Meurnier-Fitzhugh and\nPiercy, 2007; Guenzi and Troilo, 2007); and the importance of teaching marketing\n5and sales planning to marketers (Reed et al., 2004). These are often approaches led by\nmarketing strategy, in which sales strategy is linked indirectly to business strategy.\nResearch directly linking sales strategy to business strategy is less common. Rare\nexceptions include Leigh and Marshall (2001), who argue for the strategic role of\nsales; and Olsen et al. (2001) who identify the need for sales strategies to fluctuate\nwith overall company strategy, with success reliant on senior sales managers being\nwell-informed about business strategies and given the resources to match company\nobjectives. Another example is Harker and Harker (1998), who identified good\nstrategic sales management as the principal factor in the successful turnaround of a\nstruggling company, as sales managers were given strategic responsibility for\nmanaging cash flow at a critical juncture. Yet these studies are few and far between.\nThis may change, however. Sales strategy is increasingly discussed in the academic\nliterature (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000), including strategic issues concerning co-\ncreation of value (Singh and Rhoads, 1991) and alliance and network creation (Dyer\nand Singh, 1998). Clearly, sales strategies have implications for the sales process and\nfor the interface of sales not just with customers but also within the organisation.\nThe sales process\nAs customers become more sophisticated and better-informed (McDonald et al.,\n2000), the sales process is much less about selling a product and much more about\ncreating a relationship. There has been an accompanying shift from product to service\n(or solution) selling (\u201cservitisation\u201d) in many business-to-business interactions (Vargo\n6and Lusch, 2004). The emergence of servitisation has inevitably widened the\nconstituency that is involved in the sales and subsequent delivery processes. For\nsalespeople to succeed in a servitised sales process they require knowledge held not\njust by marketing (unique selling features, value in use, competitive advantage,\nsegmentation, branding) but also by operations (product issues, production\nscheduling, quality control, R&D, delivery timeliness and reliability), and finance\n(profit and loss information) resulting in the need for greater internal communication.\nAt the same time, however, salespeople performing boundary-spanning roles such as\nKAM (McDonald et al., 1997) are in a position to increase flows of valuable\ninformation back to their companies. According to Festervand et al. (1988), there are\ncompelling reasons for including the sales force in the design and operation of market\nintelligence systems, including the intimacy of their relationship with the customer,\nand the low costs of exploiting this type of market information. In addition,\nsalespeople are able to provide early insights into the activities of competitors, as well\nas other marketplace changes. Despite this, many organizations fail to analyse\ncompetitor intelligence collected from or by the sales force, or to integrate this data\ninto the general market intelligence system (Festervand et al., 1988). Still worse,\nsalespeople may be reluctant to pass information on to marketing if there is no clear\nbenefit to them in so doing (Homburg et al., 2000).\nThe literature therefore suggests that the process of business-to-business selling must\nbe two-way, firstly collecting customer information and requirements and feeding\nthem back to their own organization and secondly collating organizational knowledge\nand resources. However, the interaction of sales with functions other than marketing\n7has received little attention in the literature, despite its criticality to the emerging\nservitisation debate.\nSales interaction with other functions\nThere is general agreement that improvements in the relationship between sales and\nmarketing would be beneficial to the organization in terms of improved business\nperformance (e.g. Cespedes, 1993; Dewsnap and Jobber, 2000; Rouzies et al., 2005;\nKotler et al., 2006). For example, Tjosvold (1988) found that collaboration between\nthese departments led to improved productivity and competitiveness. Improvements in\ncollaboration, interdepartmental relations, and communication quality may enhance\nthe formulation of strategy, as well as reduce conflict (Menon et al., 1996).\nFar less attention has been paid to the interaction between sales and other functional\ndepartments (Hulbert et al., 2003). Homburg et al. (2000) identify the overcoming of\nfunctional boundaries and (often) the development of cross functional teams as\nimportant facets of customer focused organizations. The account management\nliterature provides the clearest indication of the drive for integration with other\nfunctions, because of the role the account manager plays in ensuring customer\nprofitability (McDonald et al.,2000) and therefore in integrating and reconfiguring\nresources from other functional departments to satisfy customer requirements\n(Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). Piercy (2006) comments briefly on this need but\nreturns to the marketing interface as the most important area of integration for sales.\nIn terms of consistency of customer communication this makes sense, but from a\npromise delivery perspective it is operational functions that should be aligned with\nsales strategy.\n8Research design\nRecent research has indicated that sales is changing and that there is increasing high-\nlevel pressure on the sales force to become more effective (Atkinson and Koprowski,\n2006). Yet sales has generally been an under-researched area in relation to its\nmarketing, logistics and strategy colleagues. There is a need for case-based research\nto demonstrate the functioning of, and the potential for, the new sales role.\nMethodology\nThe lack of existing empirical work on which to ground this research meant it was\ndecided to follow an exploratory line of enquiry, developing theory through an\nunstructured interpretive approach (Hassard, 1993; Miles and Huberman, 1994), and\nallowing theory to emerge from the research data (Glaser, 1992). An action research\napproach was selected as this is acknowledged in the literature as a valuable method\nfor understanding organizational change (Coghlan and Brannick, 2001; Gummesson,\n2001). In the research context, action research allows collaborative problem solving\nwith those involved and the generation of new knowledge (Coghlan and Brannick,\n2001). The researchers worked alongside each organization in a collaborative effort to\nunderstand and improve the sales process (following Gummesson, 2001).\nBoth Normann (1977) and Schein (1987) suggest that the improvement of the\norganization is the ultimate test of validity for [clinical] research. Thus, where the data\nare available, the collaborative case studies report on the results that the companies\nexperienced.\n9Participating companies\nIn case study research the context is important (Patton and Appelbaum, 2003). The\norganizations were all large global companies who were changing their existing sales\nprocess to adapt to changing circumstances. The organizations comprised four global\nindustries: construction (Company A), power solutions (Company B), building\ntechnology (Company C), and electronics and software (Company D). These\nindustries were selected because of the critical role of the sales force, the lengthy and\nadaptive sales process that involved solution selling and a moderate to high degree of\ncustomisation, the scale and complexity of the customer relationships involved, and\nbecause the formal and expensive nature of the sales process meant that there was the\npotential for a major pay-off to improving the sales process.\nThe interaction with the organizations involved senior level executive vice presidents,\nand senior managers involved in managing the sales process. Considerable efforts\nwere made to identify \u2018reflective practitioners\u2019 (Sch\u00f6n, 1983; Gummesson, 2002) who\nexpressed an interest in involvement in conceptual development. The research\nfollowed the four-stage model proposed by Zuber-Skerritt (1992): \"Plan\" (exploration\nof the context ); \"Act\" (intervention); \"Observe\" (physical data collection including\nresearch notes, secondary sources and formalised interviews); and \"Reflect\"\n(analyzing the collected data and identifying themes that inductively feed into the\n\"plan\" activity of a new iteration).\nData reduction and analysis\n10\nThe observed data were analysed through an iterative process of categorisation and\nabstraction described by Thomas (1993). Reflection, the principle form of analysis in\nthis research, is non-linear, non-sequential, iterative process of systematic\ncombination that aims to match theory with reality (Dubois and Gadde, 2002;\nEisenhardt, 1989). Reflection involved two main stages. Firstly, an independent\nreview of the data collected from the four cases identifying themes relevant to sales\nchange was carried out. The second stage then involved the researchers comparing the\ncases dispassionately and debating whether and how each data item should be\nincluded in the analysis. These debates ensure \"theoretical sensitivity\" (Glaser, 1992;\nStrauss & Corbin, 1998) and involve clarifying the meaning, wording and linking\nbetween data points, themes and actions.\nThe analysis of results was based on inductive logic and drew on recommendations by\nGlaser and Strauss (1967), Miles and Huberman (1994), and Strauss and Corbin,\n(1998). Analysis was based on a constant comparative approach (Barnes, 1996),\nmeaning as the research proceeds, new data are collected and constantly compared to\nprior data and theory in terms of categories and concepts. This process is repeated\nuntil theoretical saturation is reached, i.e., until no new themes are generated out of\nthe comparison of new and existing data and theory.\nCase findings: three continuums of change\nThroughout the four cases three strong themes emerged regarding changes the\ncompanies were having to make regardless of their sales sophistication (by\n\u2018sophistication\u2019 we mean the extent to which sales had been engineered to match\ncustomer requirements such as the use of strategic account management, customer\n11\nrelationship management programs \/ systems and customization of product offerings).\nThese three themes are best conceptualized as three, somewhat interdependent,\ncontinuums:\n1) From function to process: from sales as an independent function to sales as a\npivotal part of a long term process of customer management.\n2) From isolated to cross-functional: from isolated sales departments with little\ncross-functional influence to an integrated sales department with links to other\nactivities such as finance, marketing and operations.\n3) From operational to strategic: from operationally focused to a solution selling,\nstrategically-focused part (and possibly principal part) of business strategy.\nAs we describe each of the four cases in greater depth, the extent to which these\nthemes emerge becomes increasingly clear. In terms of sales sophistication;\ncompanies A and B had relatively unsophisticated sales functions, whereas C and D\nwere already fairly sophisticated. All four companies, however, adapted their sales\nfunction along these three continuums.\nCase A: Construction Company\nCompany A is one of the world\u2019s leading construction companies, operating\nthroughout Europe and in the Americas. This case study describes company A\u2019s\noperations within a single country unit (all country units of Company A are legally\nindependent companies). The case illustrates the changing role of sales driven by a\nchange in corporate and sales strategy.\n12\nThe nature of Company A\u2019s business has changed dramatically over recent years. In\nthe past, it mainly carried out contract construction assignments based on a\ncompetitive bidding process that was lengthy, expensive and risky. Recently,\nCompany A decided on a change in its sales strategy: to reduce the number of\ncompetitive bidding processes it entered whilst seeking to increase the number of\ncooperative contract construction assignments and project development assignments it\nbid for. In cooperative construction contracts, the construction company takes a\nbroader role: finding the building lot; finding property investors to fund the build;\ndesigning; constructing; letting and sometimes building life-cycle management. Thus,\nin project delivery the construction company does not sell properties \u2013 it sells\nguaranteed cash flow to the property investors.\nBecause the company is no longer offering construction at lowest possible cost, but is\ntailoring solutions based on the purchaser or leaseholder needs, cooperative contracts\nrequire considerably more insight into customer needs as well as the development of\ncapabilities in sales and project delivery. This has had an impact on Company A\u2019s\nsales process, requiring it to develop new sales competences, especially related to\nfinance, and to reconstruct its value proposition from a property-based to a cash flow-\nbased one.\nCompany A has organised its sales in a unique way: it has no dedicated sales\npersonnel. Instead, it has project managers that are responsible both for selling new\nprojects and for managing them. The guiding principle is that the same project\nmanager manages the project from the initial bid to project finalisation. This approach\nhas several advantages. First, project managers have the skills to discuss project\n13\ndetails early in the sales phase. Second, as the same person manages both the sales\nand the project delivery phase, there are no information gaps that can occur when\ncomplex projects are handed over from sales to project delivery. Third, customers are\nable to form a deep relationship with the project manager as they know the project\nmanager is going to be their main point of contact throughout the project.\nOne drawback to the project manager approach is where there are multiple project\nmanagers providing service for the largest customers. This can translate into uneven\nservice levels and unsystematic sales and project delivery practices. To overcome this\nchallenge, Company A is developing strategic account management, structured sales\nprocesses and pre-defined offer concepts. Its customer segmentation will be an\nimportant component in implementing these initiatives.\nCompany A can segment its customer base along three dimensions: property owners\nvs. property users; private sector vs. public sector; and different property end uses\n(e.g. retail, logistics, and manufacturing). The largest customers, both private and\npublic sector, are nominated as strategic accounts.\nIt has developed four core sales processes based on its segmentation. The different\nproperty end uses are taken as the starting point for the development of pre-defined\nconcept offerings that differ for different property end uses. These concepts are\ntargeted mainly at those customers that are not frequent property builders or whose\nmain business resides outside construction and property development (i.e. non-key\naccounts). The new processes require considerable cross-functional cooperation\nwithin Company A: in order to pre-package complex offerings, the project managers\n14\nhave to cooperate with designers, technical experts, construction experts, financial\nexperts, and end use area experts. Additionally, the top management of Company A\nhas to be involved in concept creation to ensure that the created concepts support the\nachievement of the overall business strategy.\nThe link between sales and finance is particularly interesting. At Company A, sales\nhas a special role in corporate risk management. In the project development business,\nas in other businesses, there is a relationship between risk and return: the more risks\nthe construction company is willing to assume, the higher their profits. However, its\ncorporate guidelines prevent Company A from putting building lots onto its balance\nsheet. Therefore, the project managers and the financial experts have to cooperate\nclosely to ensure that Company A has a risk position that does not exceed the risk\nlimits set by top management but that optimises profit.\nEarly results suggest a positive pay-off in terms of risk reduction and revenue growth.\nCompany A has removed some \u2018fail points\u2019 in its sales process and is growing\nstrongly in a competitive and difficult market place.\nCase B: Power solutions provider\nOur second case study illustrates sales interaction with other functions. Company B is\na global power solution provider previously organised purely around product business\nunits. The power supply industry has been moving from a dual approach (equipment\nand service) towards power solutions. This has had a big impact on Company B\u2019s\nvalue proposition and internal organisation. Previously, there were two business\ndivisions, each with its own salesforce. The equipment salesforce was focused on one-\n15\noff projects whereas the service salesforce sold spare parts in a transactional manner\nbut also offered long-term maintenance agreements.\nIn moving towards power solutions, it created a horizontal sales unit that included\nmarketing, business intelligence, concept design, and customer relationship\nmanagement. There were also sales personnel within the product units who\ncollaborated in many sales cases with the horizontal unit. The majority of sales cases\nare therefore handled by cross-functional teams in which the product unit sales\npersonnel focus on product expertise whilst the people from the Sales unit concentrate\non customer understanding. In complex sales cases the sales team is even larger: the\nsales and product sales experts are joined by top management representatives and\nengineers who begin creating customer-specific product specifications early in the\nsales phase.\nIn addition, Company B created a separate solutions business unit alongside the\ntraditional product business units, in order to provide a complete lifecycle service.\nThe role of the solutions business unit is to pre-package the products and services of\nother business units into sellable solutions. The solution business unit also supports\nthe sales and product business units in sales and project delivery. Company B has\nmade a conscious decision to focus the efforts of the solutions business unit onto\nthose customers that are more open to outsourcing and where Company B can create\nadded value.\nCompany B has initiated strategic account management, but to date it has not\nprogressed into corporate level systematic processes or changes in organizational\n16\nstructure. The most recent organizational change, however, has strong indirect links to\nstrategic accounts. There is a considerable overlap between the solution customers\nand the strategic accounts so, in part, the solutions business has been created to\nprovide enhanced service for its strategic accounts.\nThe most sophisticated solution created by the solutions unit, remote operations,\nrequires deep integration both within company B and with the customers. In remote\noperation, Company B assumes full responsibility of the power systems operations at\nthe customer site, ranging from power system installation to day-to-day operations\nand maintenance. In order to deliver remote operation solutions, company B has to\nhave access to various resources and information typically controlled by the customer.\nCompany B has used acquisitions to gain new resources and know-how in operating\npower systems, service operations, and maintenance operations. Gathering the\ninformation needed to run power systems operations, on the other hand, needs deep\ncooperation with the customer: company B has to have instant access to information\non customer operations in order to be able to provide the customer with sufficient\npower levels at all times. The value proposition used to sell remote operations\nsolutions is quite different from value propositions used to sell other company B\nproducts and services. While selling power systems company B usually argues the\ntotal cost of ownership during the lifetime of the system; in remote operations sales\ncompany B\u2019s value proposition is built around availability of power: company B\npromises to deliver the needed power level at all times.\nAlthough the sales unit is separate from the product business units, the sales directors\nare closely involved in creating the business strategies for all these business units.\n17\nAdditionally, the sales directors are part of the extended executive board of Company\nB. Company B also monitors sales and customer related metrics as an integral part of\nits management system. Metrics such as order intake and customer satisfaction are\nsome of the key performance indicators (KPIs) continuously followed up by the top\nmanagement. The KPIs show steady improvement and the company is performing\nstrongly.\nThis is an illustration of a change to sales strategy that was enabled through the\ndevelopment of a networked sales function. However, these processes are highly\ncomplicated and have created considerable conflicts within the organisation. As a\nresult, the company is considering a further organisational structure change to a\ncustomer segment organisation where sales and account management processes would\nbe handled by sector-specialist teams who would own the customer relationship. In\nthis revised structure, the product people will support the relationship team. This\nmove will integrate the product business units into the relationship management\nprocess, although overall ownership of the relationship will belong to the relationship\nmanagement team.\nCase C: Building technology provider\nThe third case study illustrates a dramatic change in the sales process that arose from\na change in sales strategy and that required sales to interface with other business\nfunctions. The changes resulted in a closer link between sales and corporate strategy.\nCompany C is a global building technology company with two divisions: new\nequipment sales, and service sales. Historically these two divisions operated with\n18\nseparate sales departments. Several years ago, Company C initiated a corporate-wide\ntransformation programme aimed at achieving strong growth through increased\ncustomer-centricity. During this transformation program, the sales function was\nradically reformed in four respects: creation of cross-functional processes,\ndevelopment of a partnership program for strategic customers, re-definition of the role\nof its major project business unit, and integration of customer- and sales-related issues\ninto corporate strategy and the management system.\nThe starting point for this transformation was a change in the definition of a customer.\nCompany C decided that property developers, building owners, and facility managers\nwere as important as the architects and construction companies that have primary\nroles in the construction process.\nThe transformation of the sales process was implemented through the development of\na \u2018process hierarchy\u2019. Four company-wide processes were identified: customer\nmanagement, order and delivery, product and service management, and planning and\nsupport. Next, the core processes were analysed into their constituent processes. So,\nfor example, the customer management process had four constituent processes:\nmanaging customer relationships, creating demand, selling, and delivering offering.\nOnce these constituent processes were identified they, in turn, were divided into sub-\nprocesses, work flows and procedures.\nWithin the customer management process, Company C identified nine roles, of which\nfive (including key account managers and sales managers) reside within the traditional\ndomain of the sales function. However, four other roles lay outside the traditional\n19\nsales domain (marketing manager, global marketing, technician\/supervisor,\nengineering, and top management). This analysis revealed the need for Company C to\nmanage sales as a cross-functional process rather than a set of functional activities.\nThe way that the role of a service technician changed illustrates the transformation of\nCompany C\u2019s sales from functional to cross-functional process. In the past, the\nservice technicians had visited customer sites purely to perform service operations.\nThe service technicians were trained to identify sales opportunities while they worked\non customer sites; for example, a service technician could identify customer needs for\na larger service package, or equipment modernisation. Based on the magnitude of the\nidentified sales opportunity, the service technician relays the information to the\nappropriate sales manager or account manager. Expanding the role of a service\ntechnician to a cross-functional one has enabled Company C to increase its service\nsales considerably.\nCompany C\u2019s sales transformation also involved the development of a partnership\nprogramme. It has selected a small number of strategic customers out of its global\ncustomer base based on relationship volume, relationship profitability, relationship\nstrength, growth potential, and learning potential. These strategic customers bring in\n30% of the total corporate turnover. The objective of the partnership program is to\nensure a collaborative cross-functional and cross-business unit approach within\nCompany C that exploits all opportunities for cross-selling, up-selling and additional\nsales while ensuring that the strategic customers achieve optimal performance of their\nmachinery at minimum cost of ownership. All customers in the partnership program\nare offered access to Company C\u2019s top management. Annual relationship reviews are\n20\nused to develop a deep understanding of the strategic customers and to create\nencounters that provide a natural platform for a management-level dialogue.\nCompany C offers twelve components in its partnership program. These components\n(such as budgeting, customised service scheduling and remote monitoring services)\ndefine the customer-specific solution for each customer in the partnership program.\nThe components are designed in a way that creates value to both the customer and\nCompany C. For example, the budgeting service ensures that the customer has its\ninstalled base of machinery serviced and modernised according to regulations and at\nthe minimum total cost of ownership, whilst simultaneously providing the supplier\nwith insight about the future service and modernisation needs of the customer.\nCompany C has also changed the role of its major projects unit into a cross-functional\nbusiness unit that focuses on large-scale projects related to the construction of new\nshopping centres, large buildings and airports. These large projects do not always\ncome from the strategic customers and therefore are not eligible for the partnership\nprogram. The major projects unit packages all Company C\u2019s products and services\nfrom all business units. Moreover, considerable cross-border and cross-functional\ncooperation within Company C is needed to sell major projects: the major projects are\nsold globally from the major projects unit; and sales, engineering and top management\nhave to cooperate closely in order to win a case that can consists of hundreds of\nmachinery specifically engineered for the customer.\nAn essential aspect of the success of Company C\u2019s new sales process is its integration\nwith strategy and management. The executive board of Company C has set defined\n21\nobjectives and milestones for all strategic sales initiatives, and the progress of these\ninitiatives is followed up in every executive board meeting. In addition, the main\noperational metrics were changed to include more sales and customer related metrics.\nToday, the executive board tracks sales and customer metrics such as: the number of\nsales calls, growth of the number of service contracts in selects segments, growth of\norder volumes from strategic customers, and the cancellation rate for service\ncontracts.\nCompany C has achieved substantial business performance improvements after it\ninitiated its transformation program. Two years into the transformation, sales to\nstrategic customers have grown over three times as fast as overall revenue growth.\nAdditionally, the company\u2019s share of spend has increased and customer loyalty has\nimproved.\nCase D: Electronics and software provider\nThe case of Company D illustrates the integration of sales and corporate strategy\ninternationally, and the consequent development of an international sales process.\nCompany D is one of the leading electronics and software providers in the world and\nhas a long history in implementing strategic account management: the company\nlaunched its first strategic account teams during the 1990\u2019s. Initially, the strategic\naccount teams focused mainly on providing service to strategic customers within the\ncountry borders, which meant that international strategic customers might be managed\nby several account teams working in different countries.\n22\nDuring the 1990\u2019s the company grew rapidly, and the complexity of the offering\nincreased considerably. Faced with its growing international business and a highly\ncomplex offering consisting of hardware, software and service components, company\nD decided to systematize its account management and sales processes. Prior to this,\ncompany D had already created company-wide processes for project delivery.\nTherefore the company had already gained experience in designing and implementing\nglobal processes.\nHistorically, the business units of company D were geographically defined and the\nprofit and loss was primarily calculated on these geographical business units. Now,\nhowever, Company D has created a separate horizontal unit that accommodates all the\nstrategic account teams. The director of this unit is a member of the company\u2019s\nexecutive board.\nGiven that a large customer can generate annual revenues of tens of millions of Euros,\nCompany D now conducts business planning in two directions: geographical business\nunits and strategic accounts. It uses a two-fold management system to align the\noperations of business units and strategic account teams. Biannual target setting for\nboth business units and strategic account teams consists of three components: volume,\nprofit and non-monetary targets. The non-monetary targets are intentionally used to\ncreate alignment between the business units and the strategic account teams. For\nexample, a business unit might receive a non-monetary target to win a certain sales\ncase that is not top priority from the business unit viewpoint, but is strategic for the\nstrategic account team and the company.\n23\nThe second part of the management system concentrates on aligning the sales cases\nbetween business units and strategic account teams. Both the business units and\nstrategic account teams have their own lists of hot prospects, but the hot prospect lists\nand the unit targets are stored in a common database. For all major sales cases the\ndecision whether to bid or not is made jointly between the business unit and the\nstrategic account team. If the two units are unable to reach an agreement, there is a\ndocumented escalation process through which the \u2018bid-no bid\u2019 decision is transferred\nto higher organizational levels in both the business unit and the strategic account\nteam. The \u2018bid-no bid\u2019 decision is crucial for Company D\u2019s business as it is not\nuncommon for investment in a sales process to reach several million Euros.\nCompany D utilises a three-tier hierarchy in categorising its strategic customers. The\ncustomer categorisation is mainly based on current business volume. For top tier\nstrategic customers, company D created a multi-functional global account team\nconsisting of an account director (a senior management position), account controller\n(finance and accounting), marketing director, care manager (after sales service), and\nproject manager (project delivery). The tier two and three account teams incorporate\nfewer roles than the top tier account teams, but all account teams incorporate multiple\nfunctional and service competences.\nThe strategic account teams create long-range strategies for their strategic customers.\nOne of the most important inputs to this is the joint offering and technology roadmap\nshared between Company D and its strategic customers. Roadmap sharing has several\nbenefits for the supplier. First, these strategic discussions about future technologies\nopen up a natural forum for top management dialogue. Next, the ability to influence\n24\ncustomer roadmaps makes it possible for company D to consolidate its position as one\nof the main suppliers of its strategic customers. In fact, joint reviews of customer\nroadmaps enable company D to affect the future of the entire industry. Moreover,\nroadmap comparisons act as an effective screening board for new technologies,\npreventing Company D investing in technologies none of its customers buy in to.\nThrough roadmap sharing, Company D\u2019s strategic account teams are in a strong\nposition when making corporate level decisions to invest in new capabilities and\ntechnologies, thus affecting the direction of corporate strategy.\nCompany D\u2019s industry is subject to volatile business cycles. To counteract this\nvolatility, Company D set \u2018increasing the share of service business\u2019 as one of their\nmain corporate objectives. The strategic account management programme has been\ncrucial in achieving this objective. The majority of new service ideas have been\ngenerated through discussion with the company\u2019s strategic customers and the\nresulting services have usually been systematised in pilot projects with strategic\ncustomers. In this way, strategic account management has been pivotal in\nimplementing company D\u2019s corporate strategy and in its success.\nSummary and discussion\nA cross-case analysis reveals three important aspects in which 21st Century sales is\nchanging (Table 1). The first aspect is that sales is increasingly about process, rather\nthan a series of separate transactions carried out by a specific function. New features\nof the account management process relating to profitable delivery of customer value\nmean that there is no fixed start- or end-point in the sales process. Instead it flows as\nan integrated relational process from customer information, to operational\n25\nmobilisation, to delivery. Although all four companies were in industries typified by\nlong-term relationships, their salesforces previously operated in a short-term\ntransactional manner. The cases suggest that, in some companies, the traditional sales\nrole may fade away to be replaced by project managers, as in Company A and, to an\nextent, in Company C.\nTake in Table 1\nThe second, related, aspect is the transformation of sales from isolation to cross-\nfunctional. These case studies emphasize the increasingly close working links\nbetween sales and operations, as sales becomes linked with delivery. The other\nintriguing light that these cases shed on the changing practice of sales is the success\nthat can come from integrating supplier and buyer companies. This integration is not\njust about delivery (Companies A and B), but also about integrating with the strategic\ncustomer\u2019s future planning through a shared roadmap (Company D). This should in\nturn both enhance delivery and improve sales forecasting accuracy. Company C also\nillustrates the role that sales can play in new product development, which may benefit\nnot just the relationship in which the development takes place but could also increase\nopportunities within other customer relationships. Crucially, the important internal\nsales interfaces supporting this change were not with marketing but with delivery,\nfinance and operational engineers, areas that has received only marginal comment in\nextant literature.\nThe third aspect in which sales is changing in these case companies is in a shift from\nan operational to a strategic activity. This is reflected in the increasing emphasis on\ncustomer issues and also on sales metrics at Board level across all four case\n26\ncompanies. Interestingly, as the case of Company C shows, this may also have an\nimpact on risk. Indeed, recent research has identified both supplier and customer\ndependency as an issue in closer buyer-supplier relationships (Ryals and Rogers\n2006).\nThe analysis reveals that the case study companies are at different maturity stages in\nterms of their sales sophistication, suggesting a development lifecycle in the changing\nface of sales. Company A is at the early stages of sophistication, just introducing\nspecialist strategic account management and defined sales processes; Company B has\ninitiated sales change programmes which may result in corporate-level processes and\norganizational structure change; Company C has a strategic account management\nprogramme; and Company D has sophisticated and differentiated sales and account\nmanagement and highly-developed planning. Interestingly, however, each of the three\naspects of changing sales (from function to process, from isolation to integration,\nfrom operational to strategic) are found in the companies with less advanced sales\nmodels as well as in the companies with more sophisticated approaches to sales and\nstrategic account management.\nThese four case studies of companies which have decided to change their sales\nfunction have revealed three common themes: from function to process, from an\nisolated to a cross-functional activity; and from operational to strategic. The case\nstudies suggest some new directions for 21st century sales. In particular, in these\nsolution selling and major account contexts, the marketing\/sales interface is not the\nmost important one, as might be expected in a traditional sales setting. Instead, the\ncases reveal that the really important cross-functionalities are with finance,\n27\nmanufacturing, supply, engineering, and servicing. More research is needed into the\nconstituent parts of each of the three continuums, to explore the multiple interfaces\nthat complex selling now requires and the implications for organisational structures.\nThese case studies also suggest that companies are using new sales processes; more\nresearch is needed into how these processes work and what makes them successful (or\nnot), particularly as organisations shift towards a consultative selling model in which\nthe final product is co-created with the customer, rather than being pre-defined.\nFinally, the research presented here has thrown up some issues relating to the\nrelationship between sales and business strategy and for salespeople themselves.\nFuture research might examine the implications of these findings for the selection,\ntraining and reward of sales people.\n28\nReferences\nAtkinson, T. and Koprowski, R.
