Polish workers for example have helped lower the cost of \nbuilders and plumbers in the UK for the use of their services. There are also \nmultiplier effects since workers will spend money locally and will contribute \nto taxation. Workers will also use transport and accommodation services as \nwell as buying their provisions locally. Skill may also be past on to others as \nan external benefit created. Establishing a free market will also lead to less \nprotectionism thereby helping to reduce cost and widen the choice of \navailable suppliers. Free labour markets can also result in less protectionist \npressure, this helps expand trade and achieve a higher global growth. \nIndeed the recent response to the global crisis has been to avoid going down \na protectionist route. Krugman shows the benefits arising from comparative \nadvantage when more international trade takes place. There can also be \nother benefits arising from new businesses that start to evolve supporting \nnew cultures in the community (Krugman, 1987). \n \nOvercoming EU barriers \nThere are a number of cases where free mobility has been questioned across \nEurope despite the fact free mobility has been offered in theory. For \nexample, Niemann 2008 shows that foreign workers with high skills that \nhave been offered work permits in one EU member country are not \npermitted to work in other EU member states. This undermines the concept \nof EU citizenship since there are limited rights associated with it. In a \nsimilar way Guliyeva shows in the past that EU nationals are not entitled to \nstudent grants in other EU member states unless they have lived there for at \nleast five years in many cases (Guliyeva, 2008). Some of the best skills can \ntherefore not be developed due to this situation and the EU may lose out \nfrom this. The EU provides funds for a lucky small number of people. \nThere has also been recent concern that citizens from recently joined \nmember states have not been given full mobility rights. In the case of the \nUK workers from EU 25 member countries have been allowed to work in the \n 3\nUK, however benefits could not be clamed for 2 years for the Eastern \nEuropean accession members. Bulgaria and Romanians can only work in \nBritain in specific industries though they will be given full rights by 2014. \nFrance and Germany had different policies and issued a quota system on \nEastern European workers. These complex arrangements make it difficult to \nachieve the benefits of migration and this particularly influences the skills \ngap that exists in many countries. Such issues also become more difficult \nwhen one sees a different approach also being adopted by member states to \nworkers from outside the European Union (McManus, 2009). It has been \nshown that in the UK non EU workers represent the largest number of \nforeign workers at present. Again there is a need for foreign workers and an \neffective EU policy being adopted. The EU has introduced the professions \ndirective as well as the harmonisation of qualifications though there are still \ndisparities between countries as the training period for various professions \ndiffers amongst countries and some countries may show a bias towards home \ncountry educated workers. \nThere are also strange differences regarding EU member state provision for \nhealthcare. Citizens of the UK who have gone abroad are not allowed to use \nthe national health care services if they return to the UK for a period of six \nmonths. Indeed trying to have an EU wide health service has proved to be \nvery difficult. In France for example healthcare has to be paid for though \naround eighty per cent of the total costs can be claimed back. In some \ncountries such as the UK care may not be provided for EU citizens if it is not \navailable for example there have been recent problems of shortages of \ndentists. The EU agreements on health provision therefore vary a great deal \nand this may prove to be a barrier for encouraging the benefits of migration. \n \nGovernance across EU member states \nIt could be argued that European law has evolved in an experimental way in \nthat the EU has tried to devise methods of keeping all countries on board. \nFor example, the clause of subsidiary has been introduced to try and allow \nthe local decision making process take place at the country level where \npossible. Countries have been allowed to opt out of policies such as the UKs \n 4\napproach to the working time directive. The EU has also introduced a \nqualified majority voting process for most directives where countries are \ngiven votes depending on their population size. The system is far from a \nperfect solution but allows a great deal of progress on integration to take \nplace, (Dearden, 2005). There have been suggestions of a democratic deficit \nthough it is also important to remember that Europe has become the most \nintegrated trading bloc in the world partly due to having effective legal \nprocesses in place. There has also been the introduction of the social \nchapter which gives workers minimum standards in EU member states. EU \nstates vary a great deal in terms of social protection and the social chapter \ndoes not introduce any numerical measures for member states to comply \nwith, (Mercado, 2001). The EU also provides funds to encourage mobility \nand integration though the EU only has a limited number of resources. Those \nwith the best knowledge of the schemes tend to get the most equal \ntreatment across Europe and these have tended to be the people with the \nbest access to education and resources. It is suggested by Velluti that it is \noften the educated middle class who are in a position to take advantage of \nthese schemes. Due to the limitation of resources there is increasing \nreliance on soft law in this field leaving it up to individuals to take action \n(Velluti, 2009).  \nLabour mobility is also a new area for EU law since focus in Treaties such as \nMaastricht and Amsterdam was more on the completion of a single market \nfor goods and services with the main goal of expanding trade. There has also \nbeen a variation on social policy across member states (Floyd, 1997). The \nScandinavian countries for example have offered greater social protection \nthan Anglo-Saxon countries such as the UK. Often taxes have been higher in \nthe Scandinavian countries though investment in training and education has \nbeen prioritised more in France Germany and Scandinavia compared with \nthe UK. Workers also have achieved higher levels of payment in the case of \nredundancy for example .This may have an impact on the decision whether \nto work abroad. Other mobility constraints may include different levels of \nhealth care and the problems of having to re register for work when moving \nto a new town in countries like France and Germany. There are additional \n 5\nproblems to mobility including family and possible discrimination \n(Granovetter, 2009). \n \nFuture possibilities \nIncreasingly the European Union is being seen as an integrated education \nmarket, for example it is possible to study in one EU country in many \nEuropean languages then continues at a higher level in another EU Country \nthanks to the Bologna process. According to the UK Guardian newspaper \nnumbers of international students at German universities are set to rise \nfrom 1.8million to 7.2 million from 2000 to 2025. Increasingly more \ninformation is being provided to workers on job placement in the EU, the \nincreasing speed of technology and the mobile phone are also helping. \nGlobalisation forces are further expanding the pace of change. However \nthere are still fewer than 5% of EU workers willing to work abroad though \nthis has increased slightly over the last few years (Mayes, 2007). It is \nunlikely that we will have a mobile labour force like the USA with over 20% \nof people willing to move; this highlights the importance of historical and \ncultural barriers that still exist in the EU as has been considered in this \npaper. \n \nConcluding remarks \nClearly, there are numerous barriers to be overcome prior to seeing the full \nfunctioning of a mobile European workforce. Capital and labour movement \ntheory shows that in some cases workers will not move from country to \ncountry unless a sufficient income is provided (Mayes, 2008 & McManus, \n2009). This helps to explain why many Polish workers have moved to the UK \nin the past as well as workers from former UK colonies. There tends to be \nmore mobility between countries where there is less distance to travel \n(Read, 1991).  Full mobility is the full functioning of a mobile European \nworkforce. If full mobility is to be permitted legal constraints will need to \nbe lifted. This will prove difficult due to the way the legal process has \ndeveloped historically in the EU. It is argued that the variations in the social \nprovisions provided in EU member States, will prevent full mobility. There \n 6\nare other barriers to mobility including lack of information on job \nopportunities as well as other social and cultural barriers including language \nbarriers and problems of uprooting and selling properties. The factors \nconsidered above and the legal process surrounding these issues help to \nunderstand and explain why it is likely to be a generation before there is a \nfull functioning mobile labour force across Europe.   \n \n 7\nReferences \nDearden S., (2005), European Economic Integration, FT Publications \nFloyd D., (1997), The European Social Chapter, Journal of European Business \nEducation, Vol 6, No2 \nGranovetter M., (2001), The Sociology of Economic Life, 2nd Edition, West \nview Press, USA  \nGuliyeva G., (2008), Lost in Transition, European Law Review, Vol 33, No6 \nKrugman P., (1987), International Economics, Scott \nMayes D., (2007), Factor Mobility, Ch. 8 in El-Agraa, A European Union, \nPublication, Cambridge, UK \nMcManus, J., White, D., Botten, N., (2009), Managing Global Business \nStrategies: A 21st Century Perspective, Chandos Publishing Oxford, \nUK \nNiemann A., (2008), Immigration Policy Treaty Revision, Journal of Common \nMarket Studies, Vol 46, No3 \nRead R., (1991), Does labour mobility matter?
