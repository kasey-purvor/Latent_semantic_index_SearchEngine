INTRODUCTION \nThe application of standard asset pricing theory dictates that expected stock returns are related \ncross-sectionally to returns sensitivities to state variables that are themselves linked to investors \noverall welfare (Pastor and Stambaugh, 2003).  Assets whose lowest returns accompany \nunfavourable shifts in that welfare must compensate investors for the loss of value while holding \nthe asset.  There is considerable recent evidence that liquidity is such a state variable (Liu (2006); \nPastor and Stambaugh (2003); Martinez et al. (2005)) that must be accounted for in pricing models.  \nHowever the presence of size effects is likely, especially within the smaller North African regional \nstock markets where the majority of listings arise either from occasional listings of major \nmultinational enterprises (MNEs) and privatizations of state owned enterprises (SOEs) or from \nindigenous family-owned small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  While small size firms are also \nlikely to be highly illiquid there is likely to be a difference between the two effects due to strong \nliquidity preferences of investors.  Consequently this empirical study investigates whether both size \nand liquidity effects are priced.  As such I ask whether differences in cross sectional expected \nreturns can be explained by fluctuations in aggregate market size and liquidity effects.  Furthermore \nI extend this question in asking whether these size and liquidity effects vary over time. \n North African financial markets are at the forefront of the Maghreb regional development \npolicy due to their potential role as a source of sustainable finance supporting industrial \ndevelopment and economic growth (NEPAD website, 2009).  However unlike in the rest of Africa \ndevelopment policy promoting full integration of financial markets has been pursued at a noticeably \nslower pace.  As such there has been greater focus in the signing of memorandums of understanding \n(MoU) between exchanges both within the region and globally (CASE website, 2009) and the \nfostering of partnerships that promote commercial awareness and training as well as the sharing of \ntechnical knowledge and resources (El-Khatib, 2008).  There is considerable international \n 3 \nawareness of these markets both from their position in the Mediterranean basin in proximity to the \nEuropean Union (EU) but also due to their inclusion in major international benchmark indices such \nas MSCI, Standard & Poors and FTSE that has provided significant marketing exposure to global \nportfolio managers.  Study of the region is also facilitated through all of the regions markets sharing \nthe same common legal regime: that of French civil code1\n Liquidity as a concept is very hard to define largely because its representative \ncharacteristics transcend a number of transactional properties of markets including tightness, depth, \nresiliency (Lesmond, 2005) and information (O\u2019Hara, 2003).  The literature has traditionally been \nlimited in only employing constructs capturing only one dimension of a multidimensional \nphenomenon.  This typically centres on variants of the bid-ask spread (quoted or effective) in \nAmihud and Mendelsen (1986), the turnover measure of Datar et al. (1998), or measures relating to \nthe price impact arising from traded volume such as Amihud (2002) and Pastor and Stambaugh \n(2003).  However there is very little published research concerning measures capturing the trading \nspeed dimension of liquidity, defined as the ability to transact large quantities quickly with little \nprice impact (Liu (2006) and Pastor and Stambaugh (2003)).  Furthermore there are serious \nconcerns over existing one-dimensional constructs ability to fully capture liquidity risk and over \ntheir inaccurate estimation of the dimension they are intended to model.  Serious concerns over the \nlimitations of any one-dimensional measure to capture liquidity effectively have been cited by \nPastor and Stambaugh (2003) and Amihud (2002) within the context of price-impact measures.  \nEqually deficiencies in the application of the bid-ask spread construct have been highlighted in Lee \n.  This was established through a colonial \nrelationship between France and Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia as well as through concerted \ninfluence on commercial legal codes in Egypt (La Porta et al (2008) and Kuran (2004)).  However \nthere are considerable differences in stock market awareness and culture between the countries as \nwell as deeper reservations concerning public information disclosure of sensitive firm level \ninformation, a necessary feature of stock market regulation, in conservative family-dominated \nbusiness environments (Kuran, 2005).  This is likely to cause considerable segmentation between \nNorth Africa\u2019s financial markets which would question the implicit assumptions of integration held \nin CAPM methodology (Sharpe (1964); Lintner (1965)).  Evidence from Hearn and Piesse (2009a) \nin their recent application of a size-liquidity augmented CAPM to African markets, subdivided into \nthree universes including one focussed on North Africa, indicates the likelihood of significant \nsegmentation across the Maghreb region.  Consequently I am motivated in the application of this \nstudy to consider both an aggregate North African universe and cross section of stocks as well as \nthree individual separate universes, for Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia respectively. \n                                                 \n1 There is also a much smaller stock exchange in Libya, established in March 2007, that adheres to legal \nregulation formed on Italian civil code.  Listings have grown to seven local firms with 14 licensed brokers.  \nListings regulations follow those prevailing in Egypt and trading is undertaken 10-00am \u2013 12-00midday \nSunday to Thursday through an electronic continuous auction (Libyan stock exchange website, 2009).  A very \nsmall exchange fully compliant with Islamic Shari\u2019ya law also exists in Sudan (see Hearn et al, 2009) \n 4 \n(1993) where evidence reveals that many large trades occur outside the bid-ask spread while many \nsmall trades are undertaken within it leading to potential bias.  Further concerns over the \napplication of one-dimensional measures focus on their being undefined in the presence of extremes \nof illiquidity as is a frequent occurrence in emerging markets (Lesmond, 2005).  A more recent \nmeasure developed in Liu (2006) captures the trading speed dimension of liquidity which is defined \nas the standardized turnover-adjusted number of zero trading volumes over the past twelve months.  \nIt is multi-dimensional in nature, capturing effects relating to trading speed, trading quantity and \ntrading cost, with an emphasis on trading speed, outlined as the continuity of trading and the \npotential delay in executing an order (Liu, 2006).  An additional benefit from the use of this \nmeasure arises from its measurement robustness in the presence of significant illiquidity (Liu, 2006) \nalthough this has only been studied within the context of the developed market of the New York \nStock Exchange.  The considerable dispersion of extremes of liquidity both between and within \nMENA markets further justifies the use of the Liu (2006) measure. \n The literature concerning the inclusion of liquidity as a priced state variable within a \nvaluation framework is very recent.  Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) find strong evidence from US \nstock data that market-wide liquidity is a priced state variable and that the liquidity premium should \nbe positive.  The study applied the innovations of a price impact measure of liquidity to sort stocks \nwithin a universe into decile portfolios with the market aggregate premium being formed in the \ndifference between returns of the highest and lowest liquidity deciles.  The explanatory power \narising from inclusion of the liquidity factor were studied through the contrast of a four factor \ncapital asset pricing model (CAPM) including market, size, book-to-market and the new liquidity \nfactor against the Fama and French (1993) three factor model and the CAPM.  Stocks with higher \nsensitivity to aggregate liquidity stocks compensate investors with higher expected returns.  \nEvidence is also found that small stocks have greater sensitivities to liquidity innovations than large \nstocks.  Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) note that intuitively it could be expected that small and \nilliquid stocks are those most affected by market aggregate drops in liquidity thereby precipitating \ninvestors to \u201cflee\u201d to assets with higher liquidity.  However their findings also show that size and \nliquidity are not the sole determinants of liquidity betas.  This finding is reinforced by the argument \nexplaining why stocks with a high liquidity beta are not necessarily illiquid.  Investor preferences \nwhen there are market aggregate falls in liquidity are also likely to focus on rival bonds markets.  In \norder to increase portfolio holdings in bonds investors may seek to sell liquid stocks in order to save \non transactions costs.  Consequently in this scenario the price reaction to aggregate liquidity \nchanges is stronger for more liquid stocks.  Equally prices of liquid stocks could have greater \nsensitivity to aggregate liquidity shocks if such stocks are held in greater proportions within the \nportfolios of liquidity-conscious investors.  Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) find little basis for \nliquidity betas to bear a simple relation to stock size and liquidity.  Liu (2006) builds on this \nbackground in first using a new liquidity construct to estimate stock liquidity and then including \n 5 \nthis factor within a two factor augmented capital asset pricing model (CAPM).  While the \nadditional liquidity factor offers strong performance in explaining the cross section of US stock \nreturns the findings are in contradiction to the earlier findings of Pastor and Stambaugh as the \nliquidity premium solely subsumes the documented anomalies such as size and the book-to-market \neffects from Fama and French (1993).  The applied literature using these liquidity measures has \ngrown rapidly recently with studies relating to Africa (Hearn and Piesse, 2009a, 2010), South East \nAsia (Shum and Tang, 2005) and the Spanish stock market (Martinez et al, 2005).  These studies \nfound evidence supporting the continued use of both size and liquidity factors in valuation.  While \ninvestors would still require compensation from holding small size stocks owing to their additional \nrisks as envisaged in Fama and French (1993) and while these stocks will likely be illiquid, the \nliquidity and size effects will be largely uncorrelated due to investors motivated to the most liquid \nstocks in the presence of uncertainty.  I justify the use of both size and liquidity factors due to \nAfrican emerging markets having well documented dispersions in both size and liquidity while \ninvestors, conscious of liquidity, are likely to invest in liquid stocks inferring a lack of correlation \nbetween size and liquidity effects.  As such a three factor augmented CAPM model would build on \nthe original work of Fama and French (1993), having found evidence of the existence of effects due \nto size and differences between value and growth stocks, known as the price-to-book effect, across \nthe cross section of returns within the market universe.  While I retain the size factor the additional \nliquidity factor is introduced following Martinez et al (2005) and further justified by the evidence of \nthe importance of the liquidity effect over and above the Fama and French price-to-book factor \nfrom Pastor and Stambaugh (2003). \n The majority of the valuation literature concerns the implementation of pricing models that \nassume a time invariant relationship in the systemic (market) risk of an asset.  However over the \nlast fifteen years a separate literature concerning the time varying nature of systemic risk has \nevolved from an increasing concerns of the violation of assumptions inherent in the linear model \nsuch as normality, identity and independence of stock returns (Grout and Zalewska, 2006).  \nPettengill et al (1995) studied the relationship between risk and return in \u201cup\u201d as opposed to \n\u201cdown\u201d markets while Bekeart and Harvey (1995) undertook a similar study using Markov-\nswitching regressions across a broad sample of emerging markets to examine differences between \nperiods of integration with world market and segmentation.  Brooks et al (1998) used time varying \ntechniques based on the Kalman-filter approach and applied to Australian industry portfolios \nfinding that these techniques produced improved in and out of sample performances than other \neconometric techniques.  Grout and Zalewska (2006) find that the use of Kalman filter methods is \npreferable to Markov-switching regressions owing to their not having to define the exact point of \nthe switch (Grout and Zalewska, 2006).  Instead any changes in the time path of betas can be \nassessed through the study of regression results which is particularly relevant in the modelling of \nliquidity effects as these are prone to considerable fluctuation within emerging markets.  In the light \n 6 \nof this evidence I use time varying techniques employing the Kalman filter framework following \nBrooks et al (1998). \n In this study I find evidence that liquidity and size factors are both significant in explaining \ncross section of returns and outperform the traditional CAPM.  However the linear CAPM as well \nas its time-varying analogue have questionable performance in the presence of extreme illiquidity \nas is the case in Algeria and to a certain extent Tunisia.  Models involving Algeria have very low \nexplanatory power even though liquidity betas are statistically significant.  Similarly the \nexplanatory power of models applied to Tunisia, either with a North African or a Tunisian universe, \nalso have low explanatory power.  However the practical implications arising from cost of equity \nestimation indicate that Egypt has the highest costs of equity, followed by the very small Tunisian \nmarket with Morocco being the lowest inferring considerable benefits for Moroccan firms sourcing \nfinance locally to engage in competitive international production.  The profiles of the time varying \nliquidity betas indicate that the Moroccan and Egyptian equity markets have been affected by the \n2008 global financial crisis while the more segmented Tunisian market has been relatively \nunscathed.  These results support the continued use of the risk-return paradigm in valuation while \nfinding it is limited in successful application to larger and more liquid stocks in the presence of \nextremes of size and illiquidity that are common in smaller emerging markets. \n The paper is structured as follows.  Section 2 reviews the institutional features of North \nAfrican equity markets while section 3 outlines data sources before introducing the liquidity \nmeasures and their construction and finally descriptive statistics.  Section 4 outlines the two \nmodelling approaches used: the size and liquidity augmented CAPM and its time varying parameter \nanalogue.  Section 5 discusses the empirical results.  The final section concludes and makes some \ncomments on development policy that follows from the evidence presented in the paper. \n \n2. NORTH EQUITY MARKETS AND LIQUIDITY MEASUREMENT \n \n(i). North African securities markets \nThe principal characteristics of these markets are summarised below.  A more detailed discussion of \nNorth Africa\u2019s financial markets is in Piesse and Hearn (2009a) \n \nEgypt \nThe Egyptian stock exchange is both the oldest and largest financial market in the Maghreb region.  \nThe modern Cairo and Alexandria stock exchange (CASE) was formed through the integration of \nthe Cairo exchange, established in 1903, and it\u2019s counterpart in Alexandria, established in 1888.  In \nline with all other North African exchanges trading is electronic (CASE trading system, or CTS) \nalthough it is floor based with brokers orders being relayed to floor-based appointees for execution.  \nTrading is undertaken in the main listed securities market between 11-30am and 15-30pm daily (see \n 7 \nTable 1) and the market is fully G302\n There are several market barometer indices including CASE70 and the CASE All Share.  \nThere is significant sector concentration across both CASE70 and the overall market, although not \nto the same extent as the other North African markets.  The evidence in Table 4 reveals that in line \nwith the other Maghreb markets the financials sector dominates both capitalization (27.05% for \nCASE70 and 24.81% for overall) and traded value (28.97% for CASE70 and35.24% for overall).  \nThere is also significant concentration of capitalization in the Basic Materials sector (14.45%) and \ncommunications sector (21.50%) in the overall market, revealing that extractive industries engaging \nin international production raise finance on the domestic exchange in contrast to Morocco or \nTunisia. \n compliant.  However despite a sizeable brokerage community \nof 147 licensed member firms, Table 1, only 30 account for over 70% of exchange order flow \n(CASE website, 2009).  Furthermore order flow to the exchange is overwhelmingly dominated \nfrom investors using Cairo based brokers as opposed to Alexandria, where the former commonly \naccounts for over 92% of both buy and sell orders and even higher proportions of traded value and \nvolume (see Table 2).  The Egyptian equity market is split into several discrete compartments in \norder to attract listings.  Each is differentiated on the basis of severity of regulatory criteria imposed \non firms with the weakest being Nilex, which with a minimum number of issued shares of 100,000 \nand necessity of only 1 years audited financial statements (see Table 3), is aimed at attracting small \nand medium enterprises.  These cannot afford to meet the more stringent and costly information \ndisclosure requirements of the main market, which itself is split into official and unofficial \ncompartments, themselves further split into another two sub compartments.  The official \ncompartment is reserved solely for indigenous Egyptian major public enterprises and the \nprivatization of state owned enterprises or government divestitures with stringent regulation \nreflecting it\u2019s blue-chip status.  The regulation weakens progressively in the upper tier of the \nunofficial market to the lower tier, with the latter only requiring one years audited financial \nstatements and a mere EGP 5m paid up share capital. \nTables 1, 2, 3 and 4 \n \nAlgeria \nThe Bourse d\u2019Alger, managed by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Gestion de la Bourse des Valeurs (SGBV), was \nestablished in 1997 as a government initiative to boost private sector finance and attracted three \nlistings in the following two years (Bourse d\u2019Alger website, 2009).  These were all privatizations of \n                                                 \n2 G30 relates to the Group of Thirty which is the most influential body to encourage the standardisation and \nimprovement in global securities administration. Following a symposium in London in March 1989, the \nfollowing recommendations were agreed: i) Brokers should match trades on day after deal date (T+1); ii) \nTrade confirmation on trade day plus 2 days (T+2); iii) Central Depository for safe keeping of shares; iv) Net \nbasis settlement of cash and stock; v) Settlement takes place as delivery vs. payment or receipt vs. payment; \nvi) Settlement in same day funds; vii) Settlement effected on trade date plus 3 days (T+3) 8; viii) Securities \nlending should be permitted; and ix) International securities numbering system must be adopted (ISIN code). \n 8 \nstate owned enterprises (SOE) and owing to the combination of a dominant banking sector, \nconservative business environment in respect of divulgence of private firm information, and a \npaucity in the application of universal accounting and auditing standards the exchange has been \nunable to attract any private sector firms (North Africa Times, 2008).  The market is split into two \ntrading compartments: \u201cLe compartiment des valeurs mobili\u00e8res\u201d responsible for non-government \nissues of equity and bonds and \u201cLes Obligations Assimilables du Tr\u00e9sor\u201d covering government debt \n(Bourse d\u2019Alger website, 2009).  Trading is undertaken by electronic call auction with price \n\u201cfixing\u201d sessions (cours cot\u00e9) on Monday and Wednesday for the former market segment and on \nMonday, Tuesday and Wednesday for the latter (see Table 1).  The severity of the illiquidity caused \nthe delisting of one of the three original listings and the tiny capitalization and traded value is \nevenly distributed between the two remaining stocks (see Table 4). \n \nTunisia \nThe Bourse de Tunis was established in 1969. Trading is electronic and was introduced in 1996 \nwith the assistance of Euronext Paris. The trading system is split into fixing and continuous systems, \nwith the former handling small and illiquid securities and comprised of a series of sequential \nelectronic call auctions (Bourse de Tunis website, 2009). Trading hours in the continuous market \nare 9:00 am to 14:10 pm in the months outside July, August and during Ramadan where hours are \n8:30 am to 12:10 pm (Table 1 and Bourse de Tunis website, 2009). Settlement is fully G30 \ncompliant (see Table 1).  The bourse has recently established an alternative market with relaxed \nregulation in order to attract listings (see Table 3) and in an effort to gain a greater prominence in \nthe financing of the domestic business environment given only 5% of new finance was raised \nthrough the exchange in 2007 (Zribi, 2008).  The exchange is small, with only 48 listings, and \nhighly concentrated with 61.48% capitalization and 67.45% traded turnover in the financial sector \nalone (see Table 4).  In an effort to further boost listings a range of tax breaks are offered to firms \nseeking to raise capital on the local bourse. \n \nMorocco \nThe Bourse de Casablanca, Morocco, was established in 1929. Trading is by electronic continuous \nauction with terminals installed remotely in the small licensed network of brokers. Settlement is \nG30 compliant by MAROCLEAR, the national CSD established in 1998 (Bourse de Casablanca \nwebsite, 2009).  Formal corporate governance legislation, in the form of a Moroccan Code of \nCorporate Governance Practices, has only very recently been enacted in February 2007 through the \nestablishment of a National Commission of Corporate Governance in Casablanca (European \nCorporate Governance Institute, 2009).  However the exchange is hindered by similar problems in \nAlgeria and Tunisia in it\u2019s limited ability to attract new listings.  Consequently a range of tax breaks \nare offered to firms in order to reverse the limited stock market culture with a 50% reduction in \n 9 \ncorporation tax if a firm raises its share capital by at least 20% and relinquishes preferential \nsubscription rights or a 25% reduction in tax through a standard flotation on the bourse (Bourse de \nCasablanca website, 2009).  In line with Tunisia and Egypt the Moroccan bourse has three \ncompartments differentiated by their varying levels of regulatory stringency.  Regulation of the \nmain market (march\u00e9 principal) stipulates a minimum paid up and issued capitalization of MAD \n75m, 250,000 shares in issue and 3 years of audited financial statements prior to listing (see Table \n3).  These criteria are subsequently weakened in the development market (march\u00e9 d\u00e9veloppement) \nand growth market (march\u00e9 croissance), the latter aiming to attract very small high growth firms \n(Bourse de Casablanca website, 2009).  A reflection of the deeply conservative and entrenched \nbusiness culture in Morocco, centred on dominant family control within firms, is the lack of any \nstipulation of minimum diversification or minimum number of shareholders.  The overall market \nhas 77 listed firms with the development market being the most concentrated with one firm alone \naccounting for 49.68% of capitalization (see Table 4).  The financial and communications sectors \naccount for over 67% of capitalization in the overall market and main market, while the consumer \nnon-cyclical and financial sector account for over 60% of capitalization in the development and \ngrowth markets respectively. \n \n(ii). Liquidity constructs \nThe Bid Ask spread and commission cost \nThe Bid Ask spread and commission cost:  The data on the end of month bid and ask quotes were \ncollected from Datastream.  The bid-ask spread is calculated using the average of the available \nmonthly quotes and incorporates at a minimum a single month\u2019s quote for that month.  The average \nbid-ask spread spanning the month is used for the estimate of the spread.  This procedure minimizes \noutlier problems and averages out the recording of either highs or lows in quotes resulting from \nmonthly sampling.  Following Lesmond (2005) bid-ask spreads that exceed 80% are trimmed as \nthese are potentially errors.  The monthly quoted spread is defined as: \n( )\n( )\n( )\n( ) \uf8fa\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n+\n\u2212\n+\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n+\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\n2\/2\/\n2\/1\n11\n11\nMM\nMM\nMM\nMM\nM BidAsk\nBidAsk\nBidAsk\nBidAskspreadQuoted   (1) \n \nLiu (2006) measure \nDaily price and volume data are collected from Datastream.  The measure is derived from the recent \nwork of Liu (2006) and is defined as LMx which is the standardized turnover-adjusted number of \nzero daily trading volumes over the prior x months (x = 1, 6, 12) i.e. \n( )\nNoTD\nxLM x\n21  \nDeflator\novermonth turn1\/x  + monthsprior x in  mesdaily volu zero ofNumber \u2217\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\uf8ee=  (2) \n \n 10 \nwhere x month turnover is the turnover over the prior x months, calculated as the sum of the daily \nturnover over the prior x months, daily turnover is the ratio of the number of shares traded on a day \nto the number of shares outstanding at the end of the day, NoTD is the total number of trading days \nin the market over the prior x months, and Deflator is chosen such that, \n( )\n1\n1\n0 \u2329\u2329\nDeflator\nturnovermonthx         (3) \nfor all sample stocks3\n \n.  Given the turnover adjustment (the second term in brackets in first \nexpression), two stocks with the same integer number of zero daily trading volumes can be \ndistinguished: the one with the larger turnover is more liquid.  As such the turnover adjustment acts \nas a tie-breaker when sorting stocks based on the number of zero daily trading volumes over the \nprior x months.  Because the number of trading days can vary from 15 to 23, multiplication by the \nfactor (21x\/ NoTD) standardizes the number of trading days in a month to 21 which makes the \nliquidity measure comparable over time.  LM1 can be interpreted as the turnover-adjusted number \nof zero daily trading volumes over the prior 21 trading days, which is the approximate average \nnumber of trading days in a month.  The liquidity measure, LMx is calculated at the end of each \nmonth for each individual stock based on daily data.  Daily data is available for all markets across \nentire sample period. \n(iii). Data: Sources \nDaily stock closing, bid and ask prices, total number of shares outstanding, traded volumes, \ndividend per share in local currency and converted into UK\u00a3 were obtained for Egypt and Morocco \nfrom Datastream.  These variables were sourced from both Bloomberg and the national stock \nexchanges for Algeria and Tunisia as well as Egypt and Morocco.  These data formed the basis of \ncalculation of the daily return variance, or volatility, market capitalization, defined as total number \nof shares outstanding multiplied by daily closing price, and various liquidity constructs.  The total \nreturns series for each stock were sourced direct from Datastream for Morocco and Egypt while \nthey had to be constructed for Algeria, Tunisia and those stocks where this variable was missing in \nthe case of Egypt using the procedures employed by Standard & Poors in assuming reinvestment of \ndividends and taking account of stock splits, rights issues and other corporate actions affecting a \nstocks intrinsic value.  Exchange rate and UK- Gilt\/Treasury yield data are sourced from \nDatastream.  The one-month UK-Gilt\/Treasury Bill yield rate represents the risk free rate although \nthis is adjusted to take account of monthly excess returns as opposed to the quoted equivalent \nannualised rates.  The conversion of the total returns series and prices into sterling and the use of \nUK - Gilt\/Treasury yield rate assumes long term parity between individual domestic currencies and \nsterling. \n                                                 \n3 In line with Liu (2006) a deflator of 1,000 is used in constructing estimates for LM1 \n 11 \n \n(iv). Data: Summary statistics relating to liquidity measures \nThe considerable differences in liquidity, size and activity between sectors, listing compartments \nand national markets can be clearly seen from Table 5.  This contrasts the mean cross section values \nfor daily percentage zero returns, stock prices, traded volumes, market capitalization and bid-ask \nspreads for the component firms within the Maghreb markets.  These are further sub-divided into \nthe three major listings compartments for Morocco, main, development and growth, the two major \nindex groups for Egypt, CASE70 and Overall, and into major industry categories where industries \naccounting for only a fraction of capitalization and traded value, namely under 5% of the total, are \nomitted.  There is clear evidence of a likely size effect in all markets with considerable variations in \nthe cross sectional mean capitalization of firms between industry categories and between these and \nthe overall market.  Similarly there is a considerable dispersion in the bid-ask spread although this \ndecreases in value as size increases indicating an association between size and liquidity.  The \npercentage of daily zero returns variable, another measure of liquidity through price-rigidity, is \nhighest for Algeria (95.66%) and then for Tunisia (73.83%) and all Tunisian industrial sectors, \nwhere the most liquid, communications, has a value of 41.67%.  These extremely high values \nprovide indication that a different valuation methodology should be applied to the smallest and least \nliquid markets.  It is also indicative of the significant segmentation apparent both between and \nwithin North African markets and provides further justification for this study in it\u2019s contrasting \nindividual market universes for each of the countries in turn, bar Algeria where there are too few \nstocks to achieve diversification, against an aggregate North African universe. \nTable 5 \n \n3. EMPIRICAL MODELS \nThis section considers two conditional modelling strategies, namely the three-factor linear CAPM \nand its time varying parameter counterpart. \n \n(i). Size and Liquidity Augmented CAPM \nFollowing in the spirit of Fama and French (1993) I augment the one-factor CAPM with size (SMB) \nand liquidity (ILLIQ) factors.  Therefore, the expected excess returns on a portfolio p of emerging \nmarket stocks can be written as \n( ) ( )[ ] ( ) ( )ILLIQhSMBEsrrErrE iiftmtpftpt ++\u2212=\u2212 \u03b2   (4) \nThe equilibrium relation of the three factor model is stated in terms of expected returns. In order to \ntest the model with historical data, it is necessary to transform (4) to the following estimating \nequation: \nittitiftmtiiftit ILLIQhSMBsrrrr \u03b5\u03b2\u03b1 +++\u2212+=\u2212 )(   (5) \n 12 \nwhere the variables are described above and it\u03b5  is an independently identically distributed (iid) \ndisturbance term.  The model is estimated on a time series basis using standard Ordinary Least \nSquares (OLS) techniques, as opposed to the Fama and Macbeth (1973) rolling cross section \napproach, with the expectation that the Jensen alpha, or regression intercept, should not be \nstatistically different from zero given the theoretical relationship between an individual portfolios \nexpected returns and those of the market (Markowitz, 1959).  However Scholes and Williams (1977) \nprovide evidence against the employment of standard OLS techniques with findings that beta \nestimations are biased downwards for securities infrequently trading and upwards for those traded \nmore often.  Dimson (1979) builds on this evidence in the inefficiency of beta estimation in thinly \ntraded stocks and proposes a correction technique based on the aggregation of betas from lagged \nand leading regression coefficients.  Dimson and Marsh (1983) propose a second correction \ntechnique which uses a trade-to-trade method measuring and matching returns between individual \nstocks or portfolios and the market index between the times of the last trades in successive months.  \nI justify the use of standard OLS techniques here in order to closely follow the literature of Pastor \nand Stambaugh (2003), Liu (2006) and Martinez (2005) who use these techniques extensively in \ntheir studies involving multifactor CAPM models capturing liquidity effects.  However the \nlimitations of standard OLS techniques must be taken into account when they are applied to the \nvery illiquid markets such as Algeria and Tunisia. \n \n(ii). Time varying parameter CAPM model \nFollowing Brooks et al (1998) the time varying parameter analogue of the linear CAPM employs \nthe Kalman filter and relies on the notion of \u201cstate space\u201d in estimating the conditional constant \nterm and market beta of the multifactor analogue of CAPM.  This is represented by an observation, \nor measurement\/signal, equation and a transition, or state, equation, that in combination express the \nstructure and dynamics of a time varying system.  A state space model is specified where an \nobservation at time t is a linear combination of a set of variables, known as state variables, which \ncompose the state vector at time t.  Assuming the number of state variables is m and the (m x 1) \nvector is \u03b8t then the observation equation can be represented by: \n),0(~, 2\u00b5\u03c3\u00b5\u00b5\u03b8 Nzy ttttt +=     (6) \nwhere tz  is assumed to be known (m x 1) vector, and t\u00b5  is the observation error.  The disturbance \nt\u00b5  is assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean.  The set of state variables is defined from \nthe minimum set of information from past and present data and future values of time series are \ncompletely determined by the present values of the state variables, known as the Markov property.  \nThe state space model incorporates unobserved variables within, and estimates them alongside the \n 13 \nobservable model, in imposing a time varying structure of the CAPM beta.  The conditional betas \nare estimated using the following observation, or signal equation: \n),0(~, \u2126++++= NILLIQhSMBsRR tt\nKalman\ni\nKalman\niMt\nKalman\nittit \u03b5\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1  (7) \nwhere Rit and RMt are the excess returns of individual portfolio and market portfolios at time t and \nt\u03b5  is disturbance term.  The exact form of the related transition equation depends on the form of \nstochastic process the betas are assumed to follow and in this case a simple random walk process is \nimposed as outlined in Brooks et al (2000).  The transition equation is defined: \n ),0(~,1 QNtt\nKalman\nit\nKalman\nit \u03b1\u03b1 \u03b7\u03b7\u03b1\u03b1 += \u2212     (8) \n ),0(~,1 QNtt\nKalman\nit\nKalman\nit \u03b2\u03b2 \u03b7\u03b7\u03b2\u03b2 += \u2212     (9) \n ),0(~,1 QNss stst\nKalman\nit\nKalman\nit \u03b7\u03b7+= \u2212     (10) \n ),0(~,1 QNhh htht\nKalman\nit\nKalman\nit \u03b7\u03b7+= \u2212     (11) \nTogether equations 7 and the combination of 8 to 11 constitute a Kalman filter state space model.  \nHowever a set of prior conditional values are necessary for the Kalman filter to forecast the future \nvalue and is expressed as: \n ),(~ 000 PN\nKalmanKalman \u03b1\u03b1       (12) \n ),(~ 000 PN\nKalmanKalman \u03b2\u03b2       (13) \n ),(~ 000 PsNs\nKalmanKalman       (14) \n ),(~ 000 PhNh\nKalmanKalman       (15) \nBrooks et al (1998) cite that this technique uses the first two observations to establish the prior \nconditions and then recursively estimates the entire series providing conditional estimates of \nKalman\nit\u03b2 ,\nKalman\nits ,\nKalman\nith  and \nKalman\nit\u03b1 . \n \n4. RESULTS \n(i). Summary statistics relating to size-liquidity sorted portfolios \nThe dispersion of stocks on a market by market basis between the nine size-illiquidity sorted \nportfolios, together with portfolio descriptive statistics is given in Table6.  These have been \ngenerated separately for each of the market universes, i.e. the aggregate North African universe and \nthen for Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt individually.  There is a relatively even dispersion of stocks \nacross size-liquidity sorted portfolios for the larger North African regional universe as well as for \nthe larger individual market universes of Egypt and Morocco, while in the Tunisian universe there \nis a greater number of stocks concentrated in the three low illiquidity portfolios and fewer stocks in \nthe medium and high illiquidity portfolios.  This is likely to reflect the additional lack of individual \n 14 \nstock size and liquidity information for the extremely inactive stocks, a reflection of their greater \nuncertainty, which causes their omission in the size-liquidity sorting process. \n The mean and median returns across all size-liquidity sorted portfolios are positive, with \nsole exception of the Egyptian big size \u2013 high illiquidity portfolio, for all markets except Tunisia, \nreflecting the effects of liquidity.  This is also reflected in the measure of volatility, where standard \ndeviations increase dramatically from larger size firm to smaller size firm portfolios.  Average \nreturns in small size stock portfolios tend to be more risky than in larger stock portfolios, but also \nhave higher potential returns.  Furthermore standard deviations in Tunisia are considerably greater \nthan for either Morocco or Egypt or the aggregate North African universe and are over 30% for the \nbig size \u2013 medium and high illiquidity portfolios (see Table 6).  Equally the Tunisian portfolios \nhave the highest degree of skewness and kurtosis indicating that assumptions of Normality in the \nreturns series are questionable and indicating both the degree of segmentation of this market with \nother Maghreb markets and that different valuation techniques should be applied in the presence of \nsuch extremes of illiquidity.  However the lack of viable alternative methodologies and the ease of \napplication merit the continued use of this methodology in this study. \nTable 6 \n \nDescriptive statistics for all overall market, industry and listings compartment portfolios as well as \nthe zero-cost SMB and ILLIQ portfolios are in Table 7.  These reveal that industry portfolios have \ngenerally positive excess returns with the exception of Tunisia where apart from the financial sector \nall industries have negative excess returns.  However the greatest variations in skewness and \nkurtosis arise amongst the Egyptian and Moroccan industry portfolios.  Egyptian Industrials and \nMoroccan consumer cyclical sectors have the highest levels of kurtosis and skewness, with 11.792 \nand 2.221 for the former, and 14.689 and 2.424 for the latter (see Panel A in Table 7). \n The descriptive statistics for the valuation factors are shown in panel B of Table 7.  These \nreveal that across all market universes (Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt and North Africa) the mean of the \nmarket variable is positive.  However the means of the size factor in Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt \nindicates the likelihood of a reverse size effect from that in Fama and French (1993) where returns \nsteadily decrease as stock size increases.  The evidence also shows that there is little correlation \nbetween the SMB, ILLIQ and Market valuation factors for the market variables of Morocco and \nEgypt inferring little correlation between underlying state variables within each universe.  \nContrastingly there is some correlation between the illiquidity and market factors within the North \nAfrican markets and between the market and size factors in the Tunisian market.   \nTable 7 \n \n(ii). Performance of traditional CAPM against three-factor CAPM \n 15 \nTable 8 reports the results from the grouped pooled regression on all nine size-illiquidity sorted \nportfolios for each of the market variables: Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and North Africa.  In all cases \nthere is an increase in explanatory power arising from the augmentation of the traditional CAPM \nwith the size and liquidity factors.  Equally the Jensen alpha, \u03b1p, term was not statistically \nsignificantly different from zero for both the traditional CAPM and it\u2019s three factor counterpart, \nwith the sole exceptions of the medium size-medium illiquidity portfolio in the Egyptian universe \nand the medium size-low illiquidity portfolio in the North African universe, where the statistical \nsignificance of the regression alpha was lost following the addition of the size and illiquidity factors.  \nThis would indicate a good fit with theory.  The coefficients on the large-size portfolios are \nnegative as well as being highly statistically significant in the Moroccan, Egyptian and North \nAfrican universes.  Tunisia is similar but less profound with negative size betas on only the big size \n\u2013 medium and high illiquidity portfolios..  The negative sign on the large-size portfolio betas \nindicates that large firms\u2019 returns decrease when the size premium increases, which is the opposite \nfor small firms.  This behaviour is not expected and is indicative of a reversal of the documented \n\u201csize effect\u201d that effects the valuation of smaller firms (Martinez et al, 2005).  It is also a feature of \nan extremely heterogeneous universe of stocks, where there are considerable differences in stocks \nwithin markets as evidenced from the descriptive statistics in Table 5.  This is the opposite of what \nwould be expected and does not provide investors with good hedging opportunities.  Thus, as with \nthe results for the small-size portfolios, a different valuation method would be needed to price very \nhigh illiquidity stocks and firms accurately.  The estimated coefficients on the illiquidity factor-\nmimicking portfolios are negative for low and medium-illiquidity portfolios indicating as expected \nthat more liquid firms experience a decrease in expected returns when aggregate market illiquidity \nincreases.  In general, the coefficients on the low-illiquidity and medium-illiquidity portfolios are \nnegative, as one would expect, with firms paying lower returns when the illiquidity variable \nincreases.  However, the coefficients on the high-illiquidity portfolios are positive indicating that \nthese companies pay higher returns when the illiquidity measure increases.  The increased \nexplanatory power of these models illustrates that the augmented CAPM is appropriate for illiquid \nmarkets. \nHowever in the case of Tunisia the levels of explanatory power are frequently less than \nthose of any of the other market universes.  The severity of illiquidity issues affecting the model is \nhighlighted in the adjusted R2 of 2.73% for the small size high illiquidity portfolio in the one-factor \nmodel which leaps to 28.39% upon the inclusion of the size and liquidity factors.  A similar \ndramatic increase in explanatory power from the inclusion of the size and liquidity factors arises in \nthe large size high illiquidity portfolio where the adjusted R2 in the one-factor model is 50.99% and \nincreases to 82.98%.  Although the application of this model to highly illiquid markets is \nquestionable and the implicit assumptions regarding inter and intra asset market integration are very \n 16 \ntenuous these are important results in the context of emerging markets, as the vast majority of \nresearch on the original of Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965) is confined to developed markets. \n The estimated coefficients on both the market excess return ( \u03b2\u02c6 ) and the illiquidity factor \n(ILLIQ) are large and significant in almost all cases.  Those on the size factor-mimicking portfolio \n(SMB) are smaller in the majority of cases and are only significantly different from zero in the large \nor small-size company portfolios. \nTable 8 \n \n(iii) Modelling industry portfolios and cost of equity estimation \nCountry and industry portfolios were formed from the simple price-weighted averages of stock \nreturns across stocks aggregated into either industries or countries.  The time invariant CAPM, size-\nilliquidity and size-price-to-book value augmented CAPM models were applied to the portfolios \nwith results reported in Table 9. \n \nAverage Returns in Algeria \nAlgeria was modelled using the aggregate North African universe due to its very small size.  \nHowever the effects of extreme illiquidity are immediately apparent with the traditional CAPM \nhaving almost negligible explanatory power of less than 1% which marginally increases upon the \naddition of the size and liquidity factors to approximately 6%.  Additionally almost all the \ncoefficients are not statistically significant from zero at a 90% confidence level further indicating \nthe poor fit of this model in the presence of such extreme of illiquidity. \n \nAverage Returns in Tunisia \nTunisia was modelled using both an aggregate North African and Tunisian market universe (Table \n9).  The results are similar to those of Algeria though much less profound with significant \nimprovements in explanatory power and statistical significance of betas when the aggregate North \nAfrican universe is replaced by a Tunisian counterpart.  Explanatory power (adjusted R2) for the \ntraditional CAPM using the North African universe is less than 8% which only marginally increases \nthrough the addition of the size and liquidity factors, with the prominent exception of Diversified \n(an increase to 90.29%), Consumer cyclical (an increase to 16.77%), Financial (an increase to \n23.05%) and the overall market (an increase to 22.82%).  In these cases the size and liquidity betas \nare both large and significant indicating returns are driven by these factors.  In contrast the evidence \nfrom when the model is applied to the Tunisian universe is that explanatory power in the traditional \nCAPM is over 50% for Financial, Consumer cyclical and Industrial sectors and over 30% for \nDiversified.  The additional size and liquidity factors cause almost no increase in explanatory power \nof the resulting three factor model and the size and liquidity betas in each case are not statistically \n 17 \ndifferent from zero.  This is further evidence that distortions are so severe due to illiquidity that the \nTunisian market is significantly segmented from the other major North African markets. \n \nAverage Returns in Egypt \nThe most noticeable change between the use of the aggregate North African universe its Egyptian \ncounterpart is the considerable decrease in statistical significance of the additional size and liquidity \nbetas in the three factor model.  Furthermore there are only slight increases in explanatory power \nacross industry portfolios when the Egyptian-only universe is used.  There is also a decrease in the \nabsolute size of coefficients when the North African universe is replaced with Egypt.  Liquidity \nbetas are large and negative when the former universe if applied for Financial, Communications, \nBasic Materials, and CASE70 constituents, and decrease in value with Basic Materials losing \nsignificance at 90% confidence level in the Egyptian universe.  Consequently the market factor \nplays a greater role in explaining returns within the Egyptian universe than in its North African \ncounterpart with less importance attached to size and liquidity.  Although the differences between \nthe two universes are not as pronounced as with Tunisia these results do highlight the tenuous \nassumptions of full asset market integration across the wider North African universe and region. \n \nAverage Returns in Morocco \nThe differences arising from the use of either the North African aggregate universe or it\u2019s local \ncounterpart are very pronounced with Morocco.  In contrast to Egypt and Tunisia the replacement \nof the North African universe with its Moroccan counterpart does not result in changes in the size \nand significance of size and liquidity betas.  However while these retain their importance in \nexplaining local returns across industries and the three listings compartments (main, development \nand growth markets) the explanatory power of the three factor model substantially increases.  The \nadjusted R2 for the main, development and growth markets are 32.47%, 19.70% and 9.75% \nrespectively in the North African universe compared to 94.70%, 67.97% and 53.93% when using \nthe Moroccan universe.  Similar substantial increases in explanatory power in the three factor \nmodels are found for all Moroccan industry portfolios highlighting the lack of integration between \nthe local market and its regional counterpart. \nTable 9 \n \n(iv) Modelling industry portfolios with time varying techniques \nThe time varying coefficient model based on the augmented CAPM was only estimated including \nmarket, size and illiquidity factors.  The evidence in Table 10 provide some support to the findings \nof the preceding section where maximum likelihood convergence in the highly illiquid market \nsectors of Algeria, Morocco\u2019s development market and Tunisia\u2019s consumer non-cyclical and \noverall markets is achieved using only alpha, market and illiquidity factors.  This would provide \n 18 \nsome support that illiquidity factor does have an important role in valuation using this time varying \nmethodology. \nTable 10 \n \n Figures 1 to 7 provide time series plots of the evolution of the liquidity betas across the \noverall market portfolios in each case as well as portfolios for CASE70 in Egypt, and the three \nlistings compartments in Morocco (main, development and growth).  The evidence from the overall \nmarkets in Figures 1 (Morocco), 5 (Tunisia) and 6 (Egypt) reveals that there have been significant \nchanges in the size, direction and significance of liquidity betas for Morocco and Egypt since the \nonset of the global financial crisis and recession in 2007\/2008.  This is further highlighted from an \nexamination of Figure 7, documenting the liquidity beta of CASE70 constituents.  The time profile \nof the liquidity beta for Tunisia is markedly different and moves close to zero with a negative lower \nband of standard error indicating lack of statistical significance of the beta.  These results would be \nexpected given that Morocco and Egypt are more internationally focussed markets attracting \nsignificant amounts of foreign investment while Tunisia is much smaller and classed as a Frontier \nemerging market by Standard & Poors (Standard & Poors website, 2009). \n Study of Figures 1 \u2013 4 reveal differences in liquidity between the overall Moroccan market \nand it\u2019s three component listing compartments.  The time profile of the liquidity beta for the \nMoroccan market, in Figure 1, closely resembles that of the main listings compartment (Marche \nPrincipal), in Figure 2, while the profiles of the development (Figure 3) and growth (Figure 4) are \nsubstantially different from the main board.  However all market segments reflect a considerable \nincrease in size and significance of the liquidity beta since 2007\/2008. \nFigures 1 - 7 \n \n(iv) Costs of equity estimation \nTable 11 reports estimates of the cost of equity calculated from the expected returns from each \ncountry, industry and listings compartment regression.  Estimates are calculated using regression \nbased techniques from each of the individual country universes as well as the North African \nuniverse and then using time varying techniques using the regional universe only.  Although there \nis considerable variation in the cost of equity between sectors within and between markets, Tunisia \nand Egypt have the highest while Morocco and Algeria have the lowest.  However although the \nvery low values for Algeria seem counterintuitive when considering the extremes of illiquidity and \ninactivity in the market, they are largely in line with those used originally to discount the expected \ncash flows of the two listed firms in calculating the offer price per share at listing (COSOB website, \n2009).  However while there are small differences between the estimates generated from individual \ncountry and regional universes, the most significant differences arise between the time invariant \nregression techniques and the time varying methods.  This is exemplified by the low costs of equity  \n 19 \nin the basic materials industries between Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia as estimated by the former \ntime invariant method while estimates using the latter time varying methods regard this industry as \nhaving the highest values which is in line with previous research (Hearn and Piesse, 2010a). \nTable 11 \n \n5. CONCLUSIONS \nThis study proposes to augment the traditional CAPM and it\u2019s time varying counterpart with \nadditional returns based size and liquidity factors that mimic underlying state variables present \nwithin a universe of stocks.  The recently developed Liu (2006) liquidity measure is used to capture \nthe multi-dimensional nature of liquidity, although it has particular strength in measuring trading \nspeed, a particularly prominent feature in emerging markets where there are considerable variations \nin time between order submission and trade execution.  The valuation models are applied across \nindividual country universes as well as a regional universe for the equity markets of the North \nAfrican Maghreb region, namely Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia.  The implications of the \nstudy in terms of comparative costs of equity faced by firms within various industry sectors seeking \nto raise cost effective finance adds additional value to the findings.  An additional benefit from the \napplication of time varying techniques is that a study of the effects of the 2007\/2008 global \nfinancial crisis on domestic North African industries can be undertaken. \nThe application of both the multifactor CAPM and time varying coefficient models reveals the \nrelative contributions of the market, size and liquidity premiums in the conditional modelling of the \nreturns generating process across size and liquidity sorted portfolios.  While the very small size and \nextreme illiquidity questions the application of these valuation techniques on Algeria, there is \nconsiderable evidence regarding the segmentation of individual markets from a regional aggregated \nNorth African universe.  The explanatory power arising from the addition of size and liquidity \nfactors increases across all markets, industries and listings compartments when using the regional \nuniverse.  However in Egypt and Tunisia the importance of the size and liquidity factors declines \nsubstantially when the regional universe is replaced with its domestic country counterpart with only \na marginal effect on explanatory power.  In contrast there is persistent evidence that returns in \nMorocco are driven by size and liquidity whether at a regional or national level. \nSimilar findings arise from the application of time varying Kalman filter techniques, albeit \nusing a regional universe.  However the time varying profiles of liquidity betas reveal that the more \ninternationally focussed markets of Morocco and Egypt have been affected by the 2007\/2008 global \nfinancial crisis with betas increasing in size and significance.  These results provide some support \nfor the continued use of the risk-return paradigm in emerging markets although this is limited to \nlarger more liquid markets in the presence of extremes of illiquidity.  The evidence from the \nestimates of costs of equity reveals that these are highest in Tunisia and Egypt, where returns in the \nformer are driven by a considerable liquidity premium alone.  There are considerable differences in \n 20 \ncost of equity both across markets and between component industries providing further evidence of \nthe degree of segmentation present in North African equity markets. \n \n 21 \nREFERENCES \nAmihud, Y., 2002, Illiquidity and stock returns: cross section and time series effects.
