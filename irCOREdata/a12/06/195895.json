Introduction \n \n\u201cWilderness is what men think it is.\u201d \nRoderick Nash, in Wilderness and the American Mind (1981, p.3) \n \nWilderness is an essentially human construct based largely on individual perceptions \nand often romantic notions about nature and landscape. As such, it is notoriously \ndifficult to define in rigorous, scientific and legal terms. In the USA for example, it \ntook Howard Zahniser eight years to write an acceptable definition of wilderness and \nget this through congress and onto the statute books as the 1964 Wilderness Act. His \npoetic and succinct definition identifies wilderness thus: \u201cA wilderness, in contrast \nwith those areas where man and his own works dominate the landscape, is hereby \nrecognized as an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by \nman, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.\u201d (US Wilderness Act, \n1964, p.1). Various studies have taken this and subsequent refinements and attempted \nto use GIS to map the world\u201fs remaining wilderness areas at various spatial scales and \nresolutions. Global scale maps have been developed by McCloskey and Spalding \n(1989), and Sanderson et al. (2002). Regional level maps have been developed for \nAustralia (Lesslie, Taylor and Maslen, 1993), for the USA (Aplet, 2000), and for \nEurope (Fritz et al., 2000a). Many of these mapping projects have been based around \nmulti-criteria type approaches as a means of accounting for different priorities \nbetween spatial factors relating to wildness (Carver, 1996; Fritz et al., 2000b; Carver \net al., 2002) with the resulting maps showing a continuum of environmental \nmodification from the \u201cpaved to the primeval\u201d (Nash, 1982, p.3).   \n \nSome wildness mapping research has used a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE), using \ndifferent criteria and combination techniques. The Australian Heritage Commission\u201fs \nNational Wilderness Inventory defined wilderness on the basis of four factors: \nremoteness from settlement, remoteness from access, apparent naturalness, and \nbiophysical naturalness (Lesslie 1994; Miller, 1995). Minimum levels of remoteness \nand naturalness were defined and the factors were combined to define a wilderness \nquality index. Fritz et al (2000b) noted that remoteness and primitiveness cannot be \nassessed by a single wilderness quality indicator. Instead they proposed that \nremoteness be described as a proximity function to settled land and settled people and \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 3 \nprimitiveness could possibly be described as biophysical and apparent disturbance. \nThey weighted the factors according to the results of an internet questionnaire in a \nfuzzy MCE. Carver et al (2002) developed variation of the Australian approach using \nsimilar factors within a fuzzy MCE framework to identify the wilderness continuum \nin Britain. This identified wilderness using six factors: remoteness from local \npopulation, remoteness from national population centres, remoteness from \nmechanized access, apparent naturalness, biophysical naturalness, and altitude. It used \na web application to allow users to explore the impacts of different factor weights on \nthe resulting wildness maps. The web mapping allowed users to explore their \nperceptions of wilderness using simple slider bars and a Java application to \nrecalculate and then redraw the continuum map. \n \nA multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) methodology has again been applied in a recent \nstudy to map wildness attributes at high spatial resolutions in the Cairngorm National \nPark (CNP) in Scotland. The approach focused on GIS-based MCE using weighted \nlinear combination (WLC) and fuzzy methods that were developed during previous \nwork mapping on wild land quality (Carver 1991; Carver, 1996; Carver et al., 2002 \nand Fritz et al., 2000a) and is reported in Carver et al. (2008). Data were generated for \nthe four principal factors that contribute to wildness in Scotland as identified Scottish \nNatural Heritage - the agency responsible for the natural environmental in Scotland. \nThese include perceived naturalness of land cover, absence of modern artefacts, \nrugged and physically challenging terrain, and remoteness (SNH, 2002). For the \npurposes of the original project these data were combined using WLC with equal \nweightings for each factor. The resulting map of wildness is fuzzy and based on \nperceptions of wildness rather than strict ecological definitions. Planning and decision \nmaking bodies would like to be able to identify boundaries between \u201ewild\u201f and \u201enot \nwild\u201f for use in supporting decisions related to planning and developments. For \nexample, those developments that reduce the area of the wild category significantly \nmight be refused planning permission, whereas those that have no or only minimal \nimpact might be allowed to go ahead.  \n \nAgencies concerned with planning policy have to determine whether proposed \ndevelopments fall inside or outside of planning constraints. In many cases they are \ngiven only guidance about how to interpret and apply planning law rather than a set of \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 4 \nhard and fast rules. The latter implies a Boolean mapping of different types planning \nzones and the former indicates approaches that incorporate some of the uncertainty \nrelating to the interpretation of planning guidance. The problem faced by planning \nagencies is how to convert vague guidelines into crisp decisions, typically through the \nidentification of thresholds to determine different categories in the continuum of \n\u201ewildness\u201f.   \n \nThe problem addressed in this research is complimentary to a broad body of work that \nhas considered fuzzy definitions and fuzzy extent, exemplified by Hwang and Thill \n(2005; 2009) and latterly Ban and Ahlqvist (2009) who illustrated the uncertainties \nassociated with different definitions and conceptualizations of urban land use. The \nwork described in this paper differs from Ban and Ahlqvist (2009) in two ways. First \nBan and Alhqvist (2009) describe the generation alternative fuzzy set membership \nvalues to the set of \u201eexurban\u201f as derived from exurban definitions from the literature. \nIn this work we are not concerned with definitions of \u201ewildness\u201f. Second, Ban and \nAhlqvist explore the effects of fuzzy set combinatory-operations: fuzzy MIN, fuzzy \nMAX, fuzzy PRODUCT, a weighted average and an average. In this work we are \nconcerned with the extensions to fuzzy combinatory-operations such as are included \nin Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA). These were introduced in an informatics \ncontext by Yager (1998) and in a GIS by Jiang and Eastman (2000), Eastman (2006), \nMalczewski (2006) and Boroushaki and Malczewski (2008). This paper explores \ndifferent MCE approaches based around OWA for determining \u201ewild\u201f and \u201enot wild\u201f \nareas. These include Boolean MCE, OWA with different order weights, WLC as a \nspecial case of OWA where the order weights are equal and the Dempster-Shafer \ncombination method. Each of these approaches requires some kind of weighting \n(order or factor) and produces different spatial distributions of wildness. The scientific \nmotivation for this work was to explore the suitability of the different approaches to \nsupport decision making when weightings or expert opinion may not be available.  \n \nThis paper introduces wildness mapping and reviews multi-criteria evaluation \napproaches in Section 2 before describing the methodology in Section 3. The results \nof applying Boolean and Fuzzy MCE approaches are presented in Section 4, showing \ndifferent mappings of wildness and the (non-spatial) distribution of wildness values \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 5 \ngenerated from the same data by each approach. The results and the different \napproaches are discussed in Section 5 before some conclusions are drawn.  \n \n \n2. Background \n \n2.1 Wildness mapping  \nThere has been a great deal of debate in recent years over the definition and \napplicability of wild land in the UK (e.g. Fenton, 1996; Taylor, 2005). Perhaps the \nmost progress has been in Scotland, where some of the nation\u201fs wildest landscapes \ncan be found in places like the Cairngorm, Rannoch Moor, the Monadhliath and Glen \nAffric. Here several organisations, taking their lead from the Scottish Office National \nPlanning Policy Guideline 14 (NPPG14) on Natural Heritage (Scottish Office, 1999), \nhave developed their own wild land definitions. These include Scottish Natural \nHeritage (SNH, 2002), the National Trust for Scotland (National Trust for Scotland, \n2002) and the John Muir Trust. NPPG14 defines wild land as:  \n\u201cUninhabited and often relatively inaccessible countryside where the influence \nof human activity on the character and quality of the environment has been \nminimal\u201d (The Scottish Office, 1999).  \nThe SNH definition, published in 2002 refers to:  \n\u201cparts of Scotland where the wild character of the landscape, its related \nrecreational value and potential for nature are such that these areas should be \nsafeguarded against inappropriate development or land-use change\u201d (SNH, \np.8),  \nwhile the NTS further define wild land as:  \n\u201crelatively remote and inaccessible, not noticeably affected by contemporary \nhuman activity, and offers high-quality opportunities to escape from the \npressures of everyday living and find physical and spiritual refreshment.\u201d \n(The National Trust for Scotland, 2002, p.4).   \n \nAn important aspect of the wild land concept is its subjective and often shifting \nnature. This is characteristic of the nature of peoples\u201f differing perceptions of the \nconcept of wildness and is captured nicely in a further quote by Roderick Nash where \nhe suggests \u201cOne man\u2019s wilderness is another\u2019s roadside picnic ground\u201d (Nash, 1982, \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 6 \np.1). This presents an interesting problem that in order to manage a landscape value \nsuch as wild land quality, we first need to be able to define it sufficiently rigorously \nfrom multiple and often conflicting view points, before we can actually identify and \nmap it.  \n \nBoth Scottish Natural Heritage and the National Trust for Scotland study consider the \nmain features relating to perceptions of wildness to be: \ni) Perceived naturalness of land cover \u2013 the extent to which land \nmanagement, or lack of, creates a pattern of vegetation and land cover \nwhich appears natural to the casual observer. \nii) Absence of modern human artefacts \u2013 the lack of obvious artificial forms \nor structures within the visible landscape, including roads, railways, \npylons, hard-edged plantation forestry, buildings and other built structures. \niii) Rugged and challenging nature of the terrain \u2013 the physical characteristics \nof the landscape including effects of steep and rough terrain and harsh \nweather conditions often found at higher altitudes. \niv) Remoteness \u2013 the remoteness of inaccessibility of the landscape based on \ntime taken to walk from the nearest point of mechanised access. \nA full description of each factor is given in Table 1.  \n \n(Insert Table 1 about here)  \n \nCurrently, there is little quantitative evidence of consumer opinion regarding the \n\u201ewildness\u201f of Scotland. Therefore Scottish Natural Heritage and the Cairngorms \nNational Park Authority commissioned a market research study to evaluate public \nperceptions of wild places amongst a representative cross-section of Scottish residents \nand a subset amongst those living within the boundaries of the Cairngorms National \nPark (CNP). The study, conducted by Market Research Partners (2008), identifies the \nlevel of support for wild places and whether the views of those who live within CNP \nmatch the population of Scotland as a whole. A total of 1,304 face to face interviews \nwere conducted, 1,004 across Scotland and 300 with residents of the CNP area. \nWhilst the survey sought to identify the features which make an area wild, it did not \nask the respondents directly about the four factors identified by Scottish Natural \nHeritage as contributing to wildness. Instead the survey report inferred support for \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 7 \nthese factors by categorising the response to other questions. Carver et al (2008) \nrevisited the results of the survey and extracted slightly different factor weights based \non the responses to unbiased survey questioning. The landscape characteristics and \nfeatures identified by the Scottish and CNP residents in response to the question \u201cIn \nyour opinion, what features or characteristics make an area wild?\u201d (Market Research \npartners, 2008, p9) such as \u201cwildlife\u201d, \u201cForests \/ woods \/ trees\u201d, \u201cOpen space\u201d, \n\u201cLochs\u201d, \u201cHills \/ mountains \/ glens\u201d etc were subjectively allocated to the different \nfactors by Carver et al (2008). The weights were based on the number of responses \nidentifying each feature. The purpose of this study is not to explore the weights \nthemselves but their behaviour under different combination approaches. The question \nover which set of factors weights to use in the analysis of fuzzy MCE and the impacts \nof different order weights was resolved by taking the average of three sets of weights. \nThe weights are shown in Table 2. \n \n(Insert Table 2 about here) \n \n2.2 Multi-criteria evaluation  \nMulti-criteria evaluation combines different layers of spatial information or factors in \norder to generate an aggregated measure of suitability. In a Boolean MCE, the criteria \nare applied as thresholds to partition layers into unsuitable and suitable areas. The \nderived layers are then combined in an overlay operation to identify Boolean \nsuitability in one of two ways \n- Intersect (AND) operation, which identifies areas where all conditions are \nsatisfied.  \n- Union (OR) operation which identifies areas as being suitable if any one of the \ncriteria are met.  \nBy way of illustration the factors contributing to perceptions of wildness in Table 1 \nare continuous in nature with values from 0 to 255, as a result of a normalisation \nprocess as part of the original project brief and described in Carver et al (2008). These \nwere reclassified using a threshold of 127 to create Boolean masks (i.e. of 0 and 1) \nand then combined using union and intersect operations to identify wild and non-wild \nareas (Figure 1). \n \n(Insert Figure 1 about here)  \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 8 \n \nIn many analyses, suitability may not be Boolean in character, but has varying degrees \nof membership, and each criterion contributes evidence from which fuzzy \nmembership of the set of \u201esuitable\u201f can be determined. The maps in Figure 1 illustrate \nthe issues associated with applying a Boolean MCE in the context of decision making: \nthresholds have to be determined for each factor and what Jiang and Eastman (2000) \ncalled the \u201ctrade-off\u201d between factors has to be managed. The maps in Figure 1 show \ndifferent extremes of trade-off. For these reasons and to accommodate some of the \nuncertainty associated with suitability mapping, fuzzy MCE approaches have been \nused in many analyses (e.g. Jiang and Eastman, 2000; Malczewski, 2006a; \nBoroushaki and Malczewski, 2008). \n \nIn order to overcome the lack of sensitivity in Boolean MCE approaches, various \nfuzzy MCE have been developed by different workers. Weighted Linear Combination \nmulti-criteria evaluation (Voogd, 1983), also known the weighted mean, provides a \nrefinement to Boolean combination. It determines suitability based on the sum of the \nweighted normalised data layers representing the factors or criteria contributing to \noverall suitability:  \nSi = \nn\nj\njij xw\n1\n, where 1\n1\nn\nj\njw      (Eqn 1)  \nand where Si is the suitability score for site i, wj is the weight of criterion j, xij is the \ngrading value of site i under criterion j, and n is the total number of criteria. In \ncontrast to the Boolean approaches WLC allows trade-off between factors by \nweighting them according to the importance given to a particular criterion in assessing \nsuitability. One of the difficulties in applying a WLC is how to determine appropriate \nweights for each of the factors being combined. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) \noffers a method to over come this as weights are generated interactively with the \nrespondent (whether they are an expert or not) for input into fuzzy MCE (Banai, 1993; \nWu, 1998; Boroushaki, and Malczewski, 2008). Numerous AHP interfaces have been \nwritten for different GIS software (e.g. Eastman, 2006; Marinoni, 2004; Hill et al., \n2005 and Boroushaki and Malczewski, 2008).  \n \nJiang and Eastman (2000) summarised a number of problems with MCE analyses \nbased on Boolean and WLC approaches. First, Boolean analyses produce very \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 9 \ndifferent results depending on whether a hard AND or a soft OR operator is used. In \ncontrast, WLC approaches compensate a low score in one criteria with a high score on \nanother, providing trade-off. Second, decision risk (the likelihood that the decision \nmade will be wrong) is not properly dealt with by either approach. In Boolean \nanalyses, decision risk can be estimated by propagating error throughout the decision \nrule to determine the risk that that decision made at a given location is wrong.  \n \nOWA are multi-criteria operators suggested by Yager (1988). Jiang and Eastman \n(2000) proposed their use in a GIS context as a method to overcome the systematic \nproblems related to risk and trade-off in MCE. OWA provides continuous fuzzy \naggregation operations between fuzzy intersection (MIN or AND) and union (MAX \nor OR), bridging WLC, Boolean and Fuzzy aggregations. It allows a variety of \noperators between MIN (AND) and MAX (OR), control over the degree of trade-off \nbetween factors in MCE and thereby allows the overall level of risk to be controlled. \nOWA uses two sets of weights: criterion weights, which describe the relative \nsignificance of a particular criterion (or factor) for the decision as in WLC, and order \nweights which are applied to the ranked criteria after the application of the criterion \nweights. Consider j attribute maps, a set of criterion weights (w) and a set of order \nweights (v). The criterion weight wj is applied uniformly to the j\nth\n map layer reflecting \nthat layer\u201fs importance. The order weights are assigned to the ith location\u201fs attribute in \ndecreasing order on a location by location basis (e.g. cell by cell in raster data). \nFormally, the OWA operator associates a set of order weights V = (v1, v2, ..., vn) with \nthe i\nth\n location such that vj  [0, 1] for j = 1, 2, ..., n, and v j 1\nj 1\nn\n. It is defined as \nfollows: \nOWAi\nu jv j\nu jv j\nj 1\nn\nj 1\nn\nzij       (Eqn 2) \n \nwhere zi1 \u2265 zi2 \u2265 \u2026 zin derives from reordering the criterion values and uj is the \nreordered jth criterion weight, wj.\n \nOrder weights control the degree of tradeoff \nbetween ANDness and ORness and are defined as follows (equations from Jiang and \nEastman, 2000):\n \n \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 10 \nANDness (1\/( j 1)) ( j i)Worder i     (Eqn 3)  \n  \nORness 1 ANDness         (Eqn 4) \n \nTradeOff 1\nj (Worder i 1\/ j)\n2\nj 1\n      (Eqn 5) \n \nwhere j is the total number of factors (or attribute maps), i is the order of factors and \nWorder  i is the weight for the factor of the ith order. OWA provides an alternative to \nWLC, where the level of trade-off is full and not adjustable. A full description of \nOWA in a GIS context and the relationship between Risk and Trade-off are provided \nin Jiang and Eastman (2000).  \n \nThe OWA approach has been used for many different GIS applications: Rinner and \nMalczewski (2002) describe the application of OWA to ski resort planning, \nMalczewski (2006a) its use in watershed management, and Bell et al., (2007) use it to \nquantify socio-economic gradients in health status. Malczewski (2006b) review the \nuse of GIS and MCE. However, whilst OWA provides considerable refinement \ncompared to Boolean overlays and simple WLC, order weights have to be determined. \nThey require a degree of domain expertise in relation to the decision that is to be \nmade using the results of the MCE and an understanding of the informatics aspects of \nfactor weightings.  \n \nThus far the alternatives to Boolean analyses described above have been based around \ndifferent implementations of fuzzy set theory. Other formalisms for combining data \nsuch as Dempster-Shafer Method have also been used to combine spatial data \n(Kontoes et al, 1993; Tangestani and Moore, 2002; Comber et al, 2004; Wadsworth \nand Hall, 2007). Malpica et al (2007) review the use of Dempster-Shafer approaches \nin GIS. Dempster\u2013Shafer assesses the belief that a hypothesis is \u201eprovable\u201f given the \nevidence (Comber et al., 2004). Dempster-Shafer can be considered as an extension to \nBayesian statistics. It assigns a numerical measure of the weight of evidence (mass \nassignment, m) to sets of hypotheses as well as individual hypotheses. A second piece \nof evidence is introduced by combining the mass assignments (m and m\u201f) using \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 11 \nDempster\u201fs rule of combination, to create a new mass assignment m\u2019\u2019. Dempster\u201fs \nrule of combination is defined by: \n \nCBA\nji\nji\nji\nBmAmCm\n,\n)(')()(''\n   (Eqn 6, from Parsons (1994)) \nwhere the combined mass assignment, m  (C), is equal to the sum of the product \nm(Ai) and m (Bj) for all i and j such that set AiBj equals C. It does not consider the \nevidence hypothesis by hypothesis as does Bayes\u201f theorem, rather the evidence is \nconsidered in light of the hypotheses. Much recent work describes modifications to \nDempster-Shafer theory, but Parsons (1994) provides a clear introduction to the \napplication and mechanics of Dempster-Shafer. Dempster-Shafer explicitly \nincorporates uncertainty into belief combinations and generates two measures: \n- Belief: a measure of the extent to which the evidence supports the hypothesis; \n- Plausibility: a measure of the extent to which the evidence does not refute the \nhypothesis (i.e. Belief with Uncertainty);  \nThe interval between the Plausibility and Belief provides a measure of uncertainty \nabout a specific hypothesis and the Disbelief can be derived as the Belief, Uncertainty \nand Disbelief sum to unity.  \n \n3. Methods \n \nThis paper compares the application of different fuzzy approaches for combining \nspatial data: ordered weighted averaging, weighted linear combination which can be \nseen as a special case of OWA, and Dempster-Shafer. The study was conducted using \ndata covering the Cairngorm National Park area in north eastern Scotland and the \nwildness continuum was mapped by combining the four factors contributing to \nwildness identified by SNH using the different approaches.  \n \n3.1 Factor Data \nThe construction of the factor data is described in Carver et al (2008) and summarised \nbelow.  \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 12 \nPerceived naturalness was derived from a combination of reclassified datasets \nincluding the Land Cover Map 2000 (LCM2000), Land Cover of Scotland \n1988 (LCS88) and Highland Birchwoods Woodland Inventory (1999).  \nAbsence of modern human artefacts was constructed from LCM2000 data combined \nwith detailed terrain data and a digital surface model (DSM) and viewshed \nassessment. \nRuggedness was constructed from a digital terrain model (to derive indices of terrain \ncomplexity that take slope, aspect and relative relief) and climate data from \nlocal weather stations. \nRemoteness was mapped in the CNP based on a GIS implementation of Naismith\u201fs \nRule (Naismith, 1892) using detailed terrain and land cover information to \nestimate the time required to walk from the nearest road or track (Carver and \nFritz, 1999)  \n \n3.2 Fuzzy MCE using OWA with different order weights \nThe ordered weighted averaging was implemented inside IDRISI GIS with its \nembedded OWA module (Eastman, 2006). Each of the four factors contributing to \nwildness was weighted before combination according to the user defined criterion \nweights (the average weights from Table 2). First, the OWA process creates an \nintermediary layer for each factor from the product of the factor layer and the criterion \nweight for that factor. Next, the weighted values at each location (pixel) are evaluated \nand ranked from lowest to highest.  \n \nThe order weights are then applied in the following way: the first order weight is \napplied to the lowest value, the second order weight to the next lowest, etc. In this \ncase there are four factors requiring four order weights, summing to unity in each set. \nThe different sets of order weights were decided chosen to represent a spectrum from \nfull ANDness and no tradeoff, to some ANDness with tradeoff and full ORness. The \nselection of order weights is returned to in the discussion.  \n \nSix sets of order weights were applied. Table 3 shows the numerical relationship \nbetween the selected order weights and the ANDness, ORness and TradeOff indices. \nThe order weights have the following characteristics: \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 13 \n[1, 0, 0, 0] is risk averse with only the lowest value is given any weight. It yielded the \nminimum operator of fuzzy sets with full ANDness and no trade-off. \n[0, 0, 0, 1] is risk taking with only the highest values given any weight. It yielded the \nmaximum operator of fuzzy sets with full ORness and no trade-off. \n[0, 0.5, 0.5, 0] is an intermediate operator with intermediate ANDness and ORness, \nwith some trade-off \n[0.5, 0.3, 0.15, 0.05] is an operator with trade-off and a moderate degree of ANDness. \n[0.05, 0.15, 0.3, 0.5] is an operator with trade-off and a moderate degree of ORness \n(risk). \n[0.25, 0.25. 0.25, 0.25] is a special case to represent the traditional MCE operator \nusing WLC. Here the order weights have no impact on the factor weights. This is \nequivalent to simple weighted Linear Combination which has intermediate \nANDness and ORness, and full trade-off. \n \n(Insert Table 3 about here) \n \n3.3 Dempster-Shafer MCE  \nDempster-Shafer was used to combine the wildness evidence from the four factor \nlayers. No order weights or factor weights were used but each of the four factors were \nlinearly normalised to a maximum-minimum range of 0-1 and then split into two \nlayers (Belief and Disbelief) around their median values (medians were selected as \nthey were thought to be more representative of a central value than mean which is \nmore likely to be influenced by outliers). This was done by calculating the slope from \nthe median to 1 for Belief and from the median to 0 for Disbelief. The slopes for the \nVisibility layer are shown by way of example in Figure 2 and the terms for each factor \nare shown in Table 4.  \n \n(Insert Figure 2 about here) \n \n(Insert Table 4 about here)  \n \nThe factor belief layers were combined using the IDRISI Belief module (Eastman, \n2006) to evaluate a hypothesis of \u201ewild\u201f producing three aggregated layers: Belief, \nPlausibility and Interval. The Belief layer provides a measure of the degree to which \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 14 \nthe evidence provides concrete support for the hypothesis is the lower bound of the \nbelief in the hypothesis. The Plausibility provides the upper boundary and the Interval \nrecords the range between belief and plausibility, providing a measure of the \nuncertainty in the hypothesis.  \n \n4. Analyses and Results \nData were combined using the different MCE approaches, with order weights applied \nafter the average factor weights from Table 2. Dempster-Shafer used neither factor \nnor order weights. The results of the Shafer-Method were linearly normalised to a 0-\n255 range for comparison with the OWA results.  \n \nThe objective of the analysis was to explore the impact of different weightings and \ndifferent methods of combining data on the magnitude and spatial distribution of wild \nland. Histograms were generated for each result layer, normalised to common axes for \ncomparison but also with a variable Y axis to show any detail patterns (Figure 3).  \n \n(insert Figure 3 about here)  \n \nThe histograms in Figure 3 have very different characteristics as expected.  \nThe full ANDness in the first set of order weight [1, 0, 0, 0] results in a very \nconservative distribution of values, grouped towards the lower end of the range. \nFrom this distribution, it would be very difficult to label any given pixel as \nbeing wild and the membership functions to the set of wildness are low. The \ndistribution has peaks and toughs but is not bimodal. It allocates <0.01% of the \npixels a value greater than 127 (from a maximum of 255).  \nBy contrast the full ORness of the second set of order weights [0,0,0,1] is risk taking \nresulting in a distribution of wildness values which allocates 58% of the pixels \nto the highest level of wildness (255) and <0.02% to wildness values less than \n128.  \nThe next set of order weights [0,0.5,0.5,0] with intermediate ANDness and ORness, \nresults in bi-modal distribution of wildness values. The data is cleaved around \nthe wildness membership function of 138\/255, potentially providing a point \nwhich policy makers may wish to use to allocate land into \u201ewild\u201f, \u201enot wild\u201f and \nperhaps to start investigating \u201eintermediate\u201f or uncertain areas.  \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 15 \nThe fourth and fifth sets of order weights ([0.5,0.3,0.15,0.05] and [0.05,0.15,0.3,0.5] \nrespectively) both have a bimodal pattern. These weights have a moderate \ndegree of ANDness and some trade-off with ORness. The differences between \ntheir distributions reflected in the degrees of ANDness (more in the latter) and \nORness (more in the former) and the associated skew towards one end of the \ncontinuum of wildness. Each of these potentially indicates a point of bifurcation \nbetween wild and not wild values but with much more uncertainty than with the \nthird set of order weights.   \nThe sixth set of order weights, [0.25,0.25.0.25,0.25] are equal and equivalent to a \nsimple WLC. The resulting distribution of wildness values is determined only \nby the average factor weights in Table 2. The wildness values can be seen as the \nbaseline from which the other sets of order weights operate. It has a bimodal \ndistribution with a tail towards the lower end of the continuum. A potential \ndivide between wild and not wild values may be identified.  \nThe final histograms of wildness values are the result of applying the Dempster-\nShafer method of combination. The data are pushed out into the tails of the \ndistribution which shows a U-shape, providing a separation of wild and non-\nwild values.  \n \nFigure 4 shows the application of different sets of order weights and different MCE \napproaches. The conservative, AND operator [1,0,0,0] produces a hard fuzzy \nintersection. It identifies areas as being \u201ewild\u201f, or more correctly \u201ewith high \nmemberships to the set of wild\u201f, only if they have high values in the fuzzy criteria. \nTherefore the wild areas are a long way from human settlement, in areas of natural \nvegetation, rugged terrain and where evidence of human activity cannot be seen. \nConversely the liberal OR operator [0,0,0,1] identifies a much larger area as being \nwild taking any single piece of evidence with a high value as an indicator of overall \nwildness. The operators in between the extremes identify similar core areas with \nrelatively high memberships to wild, but the absolute values and troughs are different. \nHowever they show greater variation in the location of fuzzy wild areas with \nintermediate memberships to the fuzzy set of wild. In these areas wildness is more \nuncertain as they represent areas where the different factors aggregated in the MCE \ninto wildness trade-off against each other: some areas may be natural land cover but \nwith human artefacts visible in the landscape.  \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 16 \n \n(Insert Figure 4 about here)  \n \nThe wild areas identified using the Dempster-Shafer method of combination has \ndifferent characteristics to the other in two ways. First, the areas with high belief are \nclearly separable from those with low belief clearly not wild areas. Generally pixels \nare allocated high or low beliefs but not in between implying that there is little \nuncertainty associated with the belief. It is instructive to examine the other two \noutputs of the Dempster-Shafer MCE approach: the interval and the plausibility layers \nin Figure 5. Recall that the Plausibility layer provides a measure of the upper \nboundary of possible belief (with the Belief layer providing the lower). This means it \nincludes the belief and the \u201eplausible belief\u201f \u2013 beliefs that could exist. Many areas \ncould have a high belief in wild and the distribution is and extent similar to the full \nORness ([0,0,0,1]) layer. The belief Interval records the range between belief and \nplausibility and provides a measure of the uncertainty. If the layer is examined, the \nlighter areas indicate where there is greater uncertainty in the belief and the gap \nbetween the Belief and the Plausibility is high. \n \n(Insert Figure 5 about here) \n \n5. Discussion and Conclusions \n \nThe different mappings produced by the various fuzzy MCE approaches vary from \nOR approaches that identify large areas with high wildness memberships to AND \noperators that identify small areas. We note that further sets of order weights could \nhave been selected, for instance possible alternative third sets include [0.5, 0, 0, 0.5], \nor [0, 0, 0.5, 0.5] or [0.5, 0.5, 0, 0] instead of [0, 0.5, 0.5, 0]. Undoubtedly this would \nproduce yet further distributions of wildness values. However the purpose of this \nwork was to illustrate the variability as a result of applying different order weights in \nthe light of decision making. We have shown that varying the order weights provides \na range of operators between full MIN (AND) and full MAX (OR) and, if fully \nunderstood, can provide control over the degree of trade-off between factors in MCE \nagainst the overall level of risk, or of being incorrect (Jiang and Eastman, 2000). This \nis because different sets of order weights modify the original factor weighted data and \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 17 \ncan produce very conservative, very liberal and in between (traded off) mappings of \nwildness.   \n \nIn comparing Demspter-Shafer MCE with fuzzy MCE this paper highlights the two \napproaches: The fuzzy approaches can maintain a full fuzzy model of landscape \nwildness in their output, whilst Dempster-Shafer partitions evidence from the input \ndata in a way that approaches a Boolean aggregation of fuzzy inputs, as well as \nproviding a separate layer of the uncertainty. The fuzzy approach may be difficult to \napply where there are vague definitions of suitability (e.g. of \u201ewildness\u201f) held by the \ndecision maker. Dempster-Shafer provides a product which obscures the real doubt by \npartitioning belief and can give a clear cut definition of wildness and suitability but \nalso provides a model of the uncertainties in the plausibility layer.   \n \nThe implications of this are that the selection of method and weights has major \nimplications for the mapped outcome of suitability (in this case of wildness). For a \nwell defined problem, with clear and well understood parameters, there are obvious \nadvantages to an OWA approach: the factor and order weights can be used to \nconstrain the aggregation process in a way that represents the current or best \nunderstanding of the problem being examined. But this requires a very robust \nunderstand of all the parameters involved in the decision and how they interact to \ninfluence the final outcome. In many planning situations, such as at a local \ngovernment level, this is often not the case making the transparent use of order \nweights difficult in a fuzzy MCE. The safer option is to use only factor weights, \nwhich is often the case in the experience of the authors. The use of and setting of \nfactor weights can be justified in terms of consultants, expert or public opinion. Many \ndecision makers are happy with fuzzy representations of features as the fuzzy method \nproduces a more faithful picture, reflecting the continuum. \n \nFuzzy methods, whether Min (AND) or Max (OR) or in between, provide a full fuzzy \nmodels of landscape wildness which are able to better reflect the doubt in the minds of \nthe decision makers about wildland definitions, but only if they are able to understand \nthe GIS technology (common) and understand the informatics aspects involved in \norder weighting (rare). In many situations where GIS is being applied to map \nsuitability, decision makers may not have a full understanding of how the application \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 18 \nof order weights (and therefore trade-off and risk) relate to their problem and how \nweights interact with the resulting solutions. This informatics aspect is important \nwhen assessing trade-off and risk in light of decision making. Analytical Hierarchy \nProcess (AHP) has been suggested as a solution to the problemby providing a tool that \nintegrates fuzzy linguistic operators (Boroushaki, and Malczewski, 2008). But AHP \nstill requires the domain knowledge and a well defined understating of suitability to \nunderstand how to parameterise the input appropriately and then to interpret the rich \nand fuzzy output in light of those input decisions. \n \nMalczewski (2006b) noted that many real-world decisions are uncertain because they \ninvolve some aspects that are unknowable with uncertainty in decision-making \nrelating to \u201cuncertainty associated with limited information about the decision \nsituation, and \u2026uncertainty associated with fuzziness (imprecision) concerning the \ndescription of the semantic meaning of the events, phenomena or statements \nthemselves\u201d (p713). For these reasons the justification by policy makers for the \nselection of any given set of order weights is more problematic given the variation in \nthe results due to trade-off between (already weighted) factors. Although the \napplication or order weights may be scientifically more attractive, allowing for trade-\noff between full AND and full OR, in terms of decision making, their application may \nbe difficult to justify by non-expert policy makers who need to make transparent \ndecisions such as demarking wild and non-wild areas. The increasing sophistication of \nanalysis moving from MCE to factor weights to order weights has not increased the \nease of decision making. It may be that Dempster-Shafer MCE offers some potential \nin this area: measures of overall support are clearly separated into high and low \nmeasures of fuzzy belief, with additional evidence pushing the belief in a hypothesis \ntowards the tails of the distribution. The result is that small and on their own \npotentially less significant pieces of information gain in significance when combined \nwith other evidence. This approach could provide decision makers with a readily \nidentifiable separation of belief in wildness.  \n \nIn conclusion the work has explored different methods for combining spatial data in a \nmulti-criteria evaluation of wildness. Fuzzy MCE approaches require the selection of \nweights the application of which for order weights requires a full understanding of \nhow the factors trade-off against each other in order to control the resulting \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 19 \nuncertainty. Combination based on Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence has been \nshown to partition the aggregated datasets into wild and not wild in a way that the \nfuzzy MCE approaches did not, whilst providing measures of uncertainty in the \nplausibility layer. This work has shown that in situations where expert opinion for \nwhatever reason is not available to parameterise the MCE operation (in terms of  \nfactor weights, order weights, degrees of acceptable trade-off and thresholds to \ninterpret the resulting aggregation) then Dempster-Shafer can provide an alternative \nand \/ or complement to traditional fuzzy MCE approaches for suitability analyses. \nIn such situations the outputs of Dempster-Shafer MCE may be more appropriate than \na fully fuzzy model of suitability. Future work will compare the results of this \ninvestigation with an analysis of the distribution of different types of wild land as \ndescribed in McMorran et al (2006) and will evaluate the impact of different data \naggregation methods on resulting spatial distributions of different types of wildness.   \n \nAcknowledgements  \n \nWe gratefully acknowledge Scottish Natural Heritage and the Cairngorm National \nPark Authority in providing the inspiration and funds for this research.

But there will normally be \npotential for recovery, and the \nvegetation cover should be \ncomposed of natural components. \nSome small plantations may be \ntolerated especially at the edge of an \narea, if they are the only detracting \nfeature and of limited effect on \nwildness. \nLack of \nconstructions \nor \nother \nartefacts \n \nNo contemporary or recent, \nbuilt or engineering works \nwithin the area. \nLittle impact from out with \nthe area on wild qualities \nfrom built development, \npower lines, or masts or \nother intensive land uses (say \nforestry), or from noise or \nlight pollution. \nLimited effects on the wild \nqualities of the area from \nolder artefacts. \nOlder features (fences, bridges, \nstalking tracks, or small buildings) \nmay be present, if not intrusive \noverall. Archaeological features \n(normally a light imprint on the \nland) will contribute to visitors\u2019 \nappreciation of the continuity of \nhuman use of these areas. Some \nintrusive features (say vehicular \ntracks which partly penetrate into an \narea) may be tolerated, where their \neffects are limited, and where \nexcluding such land would reject an \narea of high intrinsic quality. \nRugged or \notherwise \nChallenging \nterrain \n \nStriking topographic \nfeatures, or land having \nextensive rough terrain or \nextensive boglands, difficult \nto traverse.  \nNatural settings for \nrecreational activities \nrequiring hard physical \nexercise or providing \nchallenge. \nDifferent kinds of terrain can offer \nan inspiring or challenging \nexperience for people but, in the \nmain, it is those landscapes which \nare of arresting character (by virtue \nof the scale and form of the terrain) \nwhich are most valued for their \nwildness. \n \nRemoteness \nand \ninaccessibility \n \nDistance from settlements or \nmodern communications. \nLimited accessibility, either \nby scale of the area, \ndifficulty in passage, or the \nlack of easy access, say by \nvehicular tracks, bridges, or \nby boat. \nDistance is not an absolute guide on \nits own, but most of the wild land \nresource will lie in the remaining \nremote areas, as defined by distance \nfrom private and public roads and \nother artefacts. \nTable 1.
