Normal expression of PCK1 is under\nhormonal control, regulated at the transcriptional level by\nboth activators, such as glucagon, and inhibitors, such as\ninsulin. The metabolic functions of PEPCK-C advocate the\nPCK1 gene as a strong candidate for conferring suscepti-\nbility to type 2 diabetes (T2D), a theory that is supported\nby the effects of gene modulation in mouse and rat mod-\nels. These include over-expression of PEPCK-C resulting in\ninsulin resistance and T2D [1].\nGenetic studies have previously implicated the region of\nchromosome 20q in which PCK1 lies in T2D susceptibil-\nity [2,3]. Cao et al. [4] reported on the discovery of a single\nnucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region\nof PCK1 (-232C\/G) that was associated with T2D in Cana-\ndian Caucasian and Oji-Cree cohorts (odds ratio (OR) =\n2.8, 95% CI 1.7 - 4.7, p = 4 \u00d7 10-5 and OR = 1.9, 95% CI\n1.2 - 3.0, p = 9 \u00d7 10-3 respectively). In addition, luciferase\nreporter assays demonstrated that the -232G allele\nincreased expression of PCK1 compared to the -232C\nallele in multiple cell lines, with no down regulation by\ninsulin. As with many genetic association studies investi-\ngating polygenic diseases, attempts to replicate the associ-\nation between PCK1 and T2D have produced mixed\nresults. A haplotype of PCK1 variants was shown to confer\nrisk of developing the disease in a Korean population (OR\nnot given, p = 6 \u00d7 10-3) [5], and a screen of 134 candidate\nsusceptibility SNPs showed that the -232C\/G SNP was a\nrisk factor for T2D in a Finnish cohort (OR = 1.27, 95% CI\n1.02 - 1.57, p = 0.031) [6]. A recent study reported that\nmultiple PCK1 variants are associated with T2D in a Chi-\nnese population [7]. The authors of this paper reported -\n232C as a risk allele, although its association with the dis-\nease fell short of statistical significance (OR = 1.24, 95%\nCI 1.00 - 1.55, p = 0.057). Studies investigating other pop-\nulations, however, have found no evidence for an associ-\nation between PCK1 variants and T2D [8,9].\nWithin the UK, T2D is 4 to 6 times more common in the\nSouth Asian population compared to the indigenous\nwhite Caucasian population [10]. Over 10% of South\nAsian adults will develop the disease and yet only a small\nnumber of investigations have reported on the genetic\nsusceptibility to T2D in this ethnic group. None of these\nstudies has looked into the possible effects of the PCK1\ngene. We therefore aimed to investigate the association\nbetween common variants of the PCK1 gene and T2D in a\nUK-resident South Asian population of Punjabi ancestry.\nMethods\nType 2 diabetic subjects (N = 903) were recruited to the\nUnited Kingdom Asian Diabetes Study (UKADS), a multi-\nple risk factor intervention trial investigating the impact of\na culturally-sensitive, enhanced diabetes care package on\nthe risk of cardiovascular disease in South Asian type 2\ndiabetes patients living in Birmingham and Coventry, UK\n[11]. All subjects were of Punjabi ancestry, confirmed over\nthree generations, and originated predominantly from the\nMirpur area of Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. Ethnically-\nmatched normoglycaemic control subjects (N = 471) were\nrecruited from the same geographical areas through com-\nmunity screening. Normal glucose tolerance was defined\nas fasting plasma glucose <6 mmol\/l and 2 hr plasma glu-\ncose <7.8 mmol\/l on a 75 g OGTT. Where OGTT was not\nfeasible, normal glucose tolerance was defined as random\nblood glucose <7 mmol\/l. Venous blood was collected\nfrom each subject after obtaining informed consent and\ngenomic DNA extracted using an adaptation of the\nNucleon\u00ae protocol (Nucleon Biosciences, Coatbridge,\nUK). The study was approved by the Birmingham East,\nNorth and Solihull Research Ethics Committee.\nSNP selection and genotyping\nIn addition to investigating the -232C\/G promoter poly-\nmorphism (rs2071023), we also utilised Haploview 3.2\n[12] to tag SNPs within the entire PCK1 gene. To do this\nwe used data from the CEPH (CEU) HapMap samples\n(Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western\nEurope)[13], as this population was the closest proxy for\nour South Asian population available on the HapMap at\nthe time tag SNPs were chosen. Our criteria for tagging\nSNPs were r2 \u2265 0.7 and a minor allele frequency (MAF) \u2265\n0.15, using pairwise tagging only. This resulted in four\nextra SNPs (rs6070157, rs2070756, rs2179706 and\nrs1042531) for analysis. All SNPs were genotyped using\nTaqMan SNP Genotyping assays (Applied Biosystems,\nWarrington, UK) and fluorescence was measured using an\nABI 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosys-\ntems).\nStatistical analyses\nGenotype frequencies for each SNP were checked for\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium using a chi square good-\nness-of-fit test. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD)\nbetween SNPs was estimated using Haploview version\n3.2. Variants were tested for association with type 2 diabe-\ntes using logistic regression, assuming an additive genetic\nmodel. Possible confounding variables (BMI, gender,\nfamily history of T2D) were initially included in the logis-\ntic regression as covariates. Haplotype analyses were per-\nformed using Haploview version 3.2. Association between\ngenotypes and continuous variables was tested using anal-\nysis of variance (ANOVA). The significance of the relation-\nship between OR and minimum age threshold was\ndetermined using linear regression. All of the above statis-\ntical analyses were implemented in SPSS version 13.0\n(SPSS Inc, Chicago IL). Power calculations were per-\nformed using Genetic Power Calculator [14].Page 2 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Genetics 2009, 10:83 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2350\/10\/83Results\nThe clinical characteristics of the subjects in our study are\nshown in Table 1. Age of diagnosis, HDL cholesterol and\nHbA1c data were available for subjects with diabetes only,\nwhereas BMI, waist circumference and blood pressure\nmeasurements were available for both the diabetic group\nand a maximum of 279 subjects from the control group.\nGenotypes of the studied PCK1 SNPs were not signifi-\ncantly associated with any clinical, biochemical or mor-\nphological characteristic measured (Table 2).\nLD patterns (Figure 1) and allele frequencies for all vari-\nants were generally similar to those seen in the CEPH\n(CEU) HapMap samples (CEU allele frequencies:\nrs2071023 (G) - 0.52, rs6070157 (T) - 0.21, rs2070756\n(T) - 0.25, rs2179706 (T) - 0.52, rs1042531 (G) - 0.31).\nGenotyping success rate was \u2265 97.5% for all SNPs studied.\nApproximately 15% of all individuals were re-genotyped\nfor the estimation of error rate, which was <1% for all var-\niants. All SNPs conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilib-\nrium with the exception of rs6070157 (p = 0.01). As the\nerror rate for this SNP was zero and it displayed no signif-\nicant association with any variable measured, no further\naction was taken to investigate this anomaly.\nOf the variants studied, only the minor allele of\nrs2071023 displayed a significant association with T2D,\nwith an OR of 1.21 (95% CI 1.03 - 1.42, p = 0.019; Table\n3). A number of clinical and morphological characteristics\n(gender, BMI, family history of T2D) were included as\ncovariates in our initial analyses, but had no qualitative\neffect on the observed association and so were excluded\nfrom the final model. As statistical power was low for all\nvariants (\u2264 72% power to reject a false negative for all var-\niants), we cannot categorically state that the other SNPs\nstudied confer no susceptibility to T2D. We have previ-\nously confirmed that variants of TCF7L2 confer suscepti-\nbility to T2D in this population [15]. Genotype of the\nTCF7L2 SNP rs7903146 was therefore included in the\nlogistic regression model as a covariate, but had no effect\non the results and so was excluded from the final model.\nOnly one haplotype, comprising the rs2071023 G allele\nand the rs6070157 C allele, was significantly associated\nwith T2D (Haplotype 1; OR = 1.20, p = 0.024; Table 4).\nThis was the only haplotype to contain the rs2071023 G\nallele and the effect on disease risk was similar to that of\nrs2071023 alone, suggesting that the haplotype associa-\ntion was due solely to the rs2071023 SNP.\nIncluding young control subjects within a case-control\nanalysis can artificially reduce effect size and statistical sig-\nnificance, as it can increase the chance of including sub-\njects who will develop T2D later in life. As we have done\npreviously with TCF7L2 [15], we re-analyzed our data\nusing subsets of the control group defined by different\nminimum age cut-offs. For SNP rs2071023 there was a\nsignificant relationship between control-group minimum\nage cut-off and both OR (r2 = 0.912, p = 3.86 \u00d7 10-7) and\nstatistical significance of the logistic regression test (r2 =\nTable 1: Clinical characteristics of subjects studied\nDiabetic subjects Control subjects\nMale Female Male Female\nn 494 409 230 241\nAge at study (years) 57.1 \u00b1 11.9 56.7 \u00b1 12.3 57.1 \u00b1 11.8 53.0 \u00b1 11.6\nAge at diagnosis (years) 49.8 \u00b1 11.7 49.3 \u00b1 12.3 NAa NAa\nBMI (kg\/m2) 27.4 \u00b1 4.1 30.0 \u00b1 4.9 27.1 \u00b1 4.1 28.9 \u00b1 5.3\nWaist circumference (cm)c 100.9 \u00b1 10.1 104.2 \u00b1 11.0 100.5 \u00b1 11.2 99.0 \u00b1 13.8\nSystolic blood pressure (mm Hg)c 141.4 \u00b1 19.3 138.9 \u00b1 22.5 139.5 \u00b1 19.6 131.1 \u00b1 20.2\nDiastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 84.5 \u00b1 12.6 84.1 \u00b1 12.0 86.0 \u00b1 11.6 82.9 \u00b1 12.1\nHDL cholesterol (mmol\/l) 1.3 \u00b1 0.6 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 NDb NDb\nHbA1c (%) 8.3 \u00b1 2.0 8.3 \u00b1 1.7 NDb NDb\nData are expressed as means \u00b1 SD. aNA = not applicable. bND = not determined. c = significant difference between diabetic and control groups (t-\ntest; p < 0.01).Page 3 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Genetics 2009, 10:83 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2350\/10\/830.838, p = 1.12 \u00d7 10-5), up until maximum statistical sig-\nnificance (minimum p-value) was reached at an age cut-\noff of 47 years.

It is interest-\ning to note that when an age cut-off of 47 years was\napplied to the control group, statistical power actually\nincreased to 90% due to the increase in OR, despite a drop\nin subject numbers.\nDiscussion\nAs previously reported in a number of studies[4,6] our\nresults suggest that the -232C\/G SNP (rs2071023) located\nTable 2: Clinical characteristics of subjects studied\nDiabetic subjects Control subjects\nrs2071023 CC CG GG CC CG GG\nBMI (kg\/m2) 28.8 \u00b1 4.6 28.4 \u00b1 4.7 28.9 \u00b1 4.7 28.5 \u00b1 5.2 27.7 \u00b1 4.8 28.3 \u00b1 4.1\nWaist circumference (cm) 102.8 \u00b1 10.5 102.1 \u00b1 11.0 103.0 \u00b1 10.0 100.1 \u00b1 13.4 98.8 \u00b1 11.5 101.5 \u00b1 13.7\nSystolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 140.6 \u00b1 20.6 139.7 \u00b1 20.1 141.1 \u00b1 22.7 134.4 \u00b1 19.3 135.2 \u00b1 20.5 136.3 \u00b1 22.2\nDiastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 84.0 \u00b1 11.5 84.2 \u00b1 13.2 85.2 \u00b1 11.8 84.8 \u00b1 11.2 84.2 \u00b1 12.2 84.1 \u00b1 12.7\nHDL cholesterol (mmol\/l) 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 ND ND ND\nHbA1c (%) 8.3 \u00b1 1.8 8.2 \u00b1 1.8 8.4 \u00b1 2.1 ND ND ND\nrs6070157 CC CT TT CC CT TT\nBMI (kg\/m2) 28.6 \u00b1 4.7 28.6 \u00b1 4.8 28.0 \u00b1 3.4 28.0 \u00b1 4.7 28.1 \u00b1 5.0 28.7 \u00b1 5.3\nWaist circumference (cm) 102.5 \u00b1 10.3 102.4 \u00b1 11.0 102.0 \u00b1 13.4 99.5 \u00b1 13.0 99.0 \u00b1 12.1 103.8 \u00b1 10.4\nSystolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 140.1 \u00b1 20.9 140.5 \u00b1 20.5 139.3 \u00b1 19.9 133.9 \u00b1 20.5 136.6 \u00b1 20.1 139.6 \u00b1 20.3\nDiastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 84.3 \u00b1 11.7 84.6 \u00b1 14.4 83.9 \u00b1 7.9 83.6 \u00b1 12.0 85.5 \u00b1 12.3 86.4 \u00b1 9.9\nHDL cholesterol (mmol\/l) 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 1.2 \u00b1 0.3 ND ND ND\nHbA1c (%) 8.4 \u00b1 2.0 8.2 \u00b1 1.7 8.0 \u00b1 1.6 ND ND ND\nrs2070756 CC CT TT CC CT TT\nBMI (kg\/m2) 28.5 \u00b1 4.5 28.7 \u00b1 4.8 28.3 \u00b1 4.5 28.0 \u00b1 4.9 27.9 \u00b1 4.8 29.1 \u00b1 5.0\nWaist circumference (cm) 102.2 \u00b1 10.7 102.8 \u00b1 10.6 102.3 \u00b1 10.2 99.4 \u00b1 12.3 99.3 \u00b1 12.9 102.7 \u00b1 13.8\nSystolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 139.6 \u00b1 20.5 141.8 \u00b1 21.6 138.7 \u00b1 19.1 134.7 \u00b1 20.3 136.9 \u00b1 20.7 132.8 \u00b1 19.5\nDiastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 84.7 \u00b1 13.0 84.3 \u00b1 12.0 83.5 \u00b1 10.4 84.8 \u00b1 11.5 84.0 \u00b1 12.0 84.1 \u00b1 14.2\nHDL cholesterol (mmol\/l) 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 ND ND ND\nHbA1c (%) 8.2 \u00b1 1.9 8.3 \u00b1 1.8 8.5 \u00b1 2.1 ND ND ND\nrs2179706 CC CT TT CC CT TT\nBMI (kg\/m2) 28.7 \u00b1 4.9 28.5 \u00b1 4.6 28.5 \u00b1 4.4 28.5 \u00b1 4.6 27.8 \u00b1 4.8 27.8 \u00b1 5.1\nWaist circumference (cm) 103.0 \u00b1 10.5 102.0 \u00b1 10.7 102.4 \u00b1 10.8 102.6 \u00b1 13.8 98.1 \u00b1 11.7 98.3 \u00b1 12.1\nSystolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 141.2 \u00b1 20.8 140.2 \u00b1 21.7 139.2 \u00b1 18.7 134.4 \u00b1 21.0 135.0 \u00b1 19.6 137.0 \u00b1 21.0\nDiastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 84.8 \u00b1 11.1 83.9 \u00b1 13.9 85.3 \u00b1 10.5 83.5 \u00b1 12.2 85.1 \u00b1 12.0 84.7 \u00b1 11.0\nHDL cholesterol (mmol\/l) 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 1.2 \u00b1 0.3 ND ND ND\nHbA1c (%) 8.4 \u00b1 2.0 8.3 \u00b1 1.8 8.0 \u00b1 1.7 ND ND ND\nrs1042531 TT GT GG TT GT GG\nBMI (kg\/m2) 28.4 \u00b1 4.4 28.9 \u00b1 4.8 28.4 \u00b1 5.2 28.2 \u00b1 5.1 27.5 \u00b1 4.6 29.1 \u00b1 4.0\nWaist circumference (cm) 102.2 \u00b1 10.2 103.1 \u00b1 11.0 101.3 \u00b1 11.2 99.7 \u00b1 13.0 99.1 \u00b1 11.3 101.5 \u00b1 17.1\nSystolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 139.2 \u00b1 20.3 140.2 \u00b1 20.6 144.5 \u00b1 22.8 135.9 \u00b1 20.0 136.1 \u00b1 20.2 128.3 \u00b1 22.2\nDiastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 83.6 \u00b1 11.0 84.8 \u00b1 14.1 85.8 \u00b1 10.4 85.4 \u00b1 11.6 84.0 \u00b1 12.2 82.4 \u00b1 12.5\nHDL cholesterol (mmol\/l) 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 1.3 \u00b1 0.6 ND ND ND\nHbA1c (%) 8.2 \u00b1 1.8 8.3 \u00b1 1.8 8.5 \u00b1 2.4 ND ND ND\nGenotypes of the studied PCK1 variants were not significantly associated with any measured clinical characteristic (ANOVA; p > 0.05 for all tests). \nData are expressed as means \u00b1 SD.

In addition, from\nexpression analysis of luciferase reporter constructs in\nmultiple cell lines, Cao et al. [4] demonstrated that the -\n232G risk allele resulted in increased basal gene expres-\nsion when compared to the -232C allele. It is possible,\ntherefore, that the -232C\/G polymorphism may confer\nincreased risk of T2D development by increasing PCK1\nexpression in the liver. This would result in an upregula-\ntion of gluconeogenesis and increased blood glucose lev-\nels. Unfortunately we were not able to investigate the\nrelationship between PCK1 genotype and blood glucose\nlevels in this study, as fasting blood glucose data were\nonly available for a small subset of our control subjects.\nInterestingly, a recent study has shown that liver-specific\nsilencing of Pck1 can improve glycaemic control and insu-\nlin sensitivity in a T2D mouse model [17], supporting the\nrole of PEPCK-C in T2D pathology and providing a poten-\ntial therapeutic target for treatment of the disease.\nAlthough the use of our entire cohort resulted in an OR of\n1.21, the removal of young control subjects should have\nincreased the validity of the control group. The OR of 1.31\nresulting from our reduced dataset, similar to that seen in\na Finnish cohort (OR = 1.27) [6], may therefore be a more\nrepresentative estimate of the true effect size of this SNP,\nPairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) in CEPH (CEU) HapMap samples and the Pakistani study populationFigure 1\nPairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) in CEPH (CEU) HapMap samples and the Pakistani study population.

Firstly, our cohort is limited\nin size. Secondly, there is the possibility of cryptic related-\nness within our cohort as the study subjects were recruited\nfrom a relatively small migrant population. In addition to\nthis consanguinity is relatively common in the Mirpuri\npopulation. These limitations increase the risk of our\nresult being a false positive. Unfortunately we cannot con-\ntrol for relatedness in our analyses as we do not have the\nnecessary data. The impact of cryptic relatedness on asso-\nciation studies, however, increases with sample size [18],\nso it may be that our relatively small cohort is to some\ndegree protected from this effect. Furthermore, we have\nno reason to believe that the degree of relatedness would\ndiffer significantly between the diabetic and control\ngroups and so the effect of any cryptic relatedness may be\nnegated.\nConclusion\nThis study is the first to investigate the association\nbetween variants of the PCK1 gene and T2D in South\nAsians. In agreement with studies in other ethnic groups\n[4,6], our analyses suggest that the -232C\/G promoter\nSNP (rs2071023) confers susceptibility to T2D. Due to the\nlimitations discussed within this manuscript, however, we\ncannot exclude the possibility that our findings are a false\npositive result. We strongly advocate that replication of\nTable 3: Association of PCK1 variants with type 2 diabetes among UK-resident South Asians\nSNP Gene Region Allele Diabetic\n subjects Fa\nControl \nsubjects Fa\nGenotype Diabetic \nsubjects n (%)b\nControl \nsubjects n (%)b\nAllelic ORc \n(95% CI)\nrs2071023 Promoter C 0.53 0.57 CC 243 (0.27) 158 (0.34) 1.21\nCG 447 (0.51) 225 (0.48) (1.03 - 1.42)\nG 0.47 0.43 GG 195 (0.22) 88 (0.19) p = 0.019\nrs6070157 Exon 3 C 0.81 0.79 CC 597 (0.67) 305 (0.65) 0.90\nCT 258 (0.29) 135 (0.29) (0.74 - 1.08)\nT 0.19 0.21 TT 38 (0.04) 29 (0.06) p = 0.257\nrs2070756 Exon 7 C 0.72 0.71 CC 456 (0.52) 246 (0.53) 1.00\nCT 354 (0.40) 171 (0.37) (0.84 - 1.18)\nT 0.28 0.29 TT 75 (0.08) 47 (0.10) p = 0.965\nrs2179706 Intron 8 C 0.58 0.56 CC 298 (0.34) 156 (0.34) 0.92\nCT 424 (0.48) 206 (0.45) (0.79 - 1.08)\nT 0.42 0.44 TT 156 (0.18) 100 (0.22) p = 0.323\nrs1042531 3'UTR T 0.66 0.68 TT 391 (0.44) 206 (0.45) 1.06\nGT 384 (0.44) 212 (0.46) (0.89 - 1.25)\nG 0.34 0.32 GG 104 (0.12) 44 (0.10) p = 0.528\naF = Allele frequency. bGenotype frequency expressed as number of individuals, n - values in parentheses indicate percentage. cOR = odds ratio, \n95% CI = 95% confidence interval.
