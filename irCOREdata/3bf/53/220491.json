While much research \nhas examined the impact of specialist schools on outcomes such as attainment, little attention has been paid to \nthe schools\u2019 demographic compositions or their potential for exacerbating segregation. Gorard and Taylor \n(2001) reported that specialist schools admitted proportionally fewer children from deprived backgrounds over \ntime. Building on their work, this paper uses data from the Pupil Level Annual School Census and the Index of \nMultiple Deprivation to examine changing intakes of specialist and non-specialist schools between 2001\/2 and \n2004\/5. Trends in segregation were not significantly associated with the presence or otherwise of specialist \nstatus in a school. However, they were significantly associated with Foundation status and the presence of \nstrong and\/ or improving examination results. Such schools drew more \u2018privileged\u2019 intakes over time. \n \nIntroduction\n1\n \n \nIn 1993, the Conservatives introduced a programme in England that would promote \n\u2018diversity\u2019 within state secondaries by allowing schools to specialise in particular subject \nareas. It was felt this would enhance parental choice while driving improvement by creating \ncompetition between institutions. The initiative grew out of earlier \u2018City Technology \nColleges\u2019 (CTCs), introduced in 1986 to promote an increased focus on vocational curricula \nand the global liberalisation of educational supply at a time of New Right fervour regarding \n                                                 \n1\n With thanks to the ESRC for award PTA-030-2003-01401. \n 2 \n\u2018quasi-markets\u2019; hence semi-autonomous schools were created with devolved responsibility \nfor funding and admissions.   \nUnder Labour, schools in England are permitted to become specialist on the basis of two \ncentral criteria: a) consistently high examination scores or at least an upward trajectory in \nexamination results; b) \u00a350,000 raised in private sponsorship. Specialist schools receive \n\u00a3100,000, then an extra \u00a3129 per pupil, per annum over four years. They are permitted to \nselect 10 per cent of pupils by \u2018aptitude\u2019, though the distinction between this and general \nacademic ability has been questioned (West and Hind, 2003).  While in 1997\/8 only 7 per \ncent of English secondaries were specialist, in 2006\/7 eight in ten secondaries specialised. \nFigure 1 shows the upward trajectory of specialist schools as a proportion of all English \nschools between 1994\/5 and 2006\/7.    \n \nFIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nResearch on the \u2018impact\u2019 of specialist schools \n \nWithin the last decade, research has been carried out on specialist schools\u2019 ability to boost \nschool improvement. Unadjusted examination scores have been identified as higher in \nspecialist schools, while the SSAT-funded series Educational Outcomes and Value Added by \nSpecialist Schools (Jesson and Crossley, 2006) which compares results in terms of \u2018value \nadded\u2019 has also reported specialist schools to be outperforming non-specialist counterparts.  \nHowever, no mention is made of the impact additional funding has on examination \nresults, or indeed the possibility that \u2018Hawthorne effects\u2019 may only be temporary. Some \n 3 \nresearch (Schagen et al, 2002; Schagen and Schagen, 2002; 2003; 2005; Leva\u010di\u0107 and Jenkins, \n2004; Noden and Schagen, 2002; 2006) has used multilevel modelling to quantify the \nisolated impact that specialist status has on school examination performance. A positive \nimpact has been confirmed, but this impact is markedly more modest than has been \nsuggested in Educational Outcomes. Attention has been drawn to the difficulties of \nmodelling resource effects in specialist schools and also to \u2018reverse causality\u2019, namely the \nproblem in policy evaluation that specialist schools are a non-random, self-selecting group.  \nSince the mass expansion of specialist schools began in 1997\/8, arguments have been \nmade that, despite improving examination scores within specialist schools, there is a danger \nthis is simply a function of the changing composition of specialist schools which draw more \nprivileged intakes over time. It is not the purpose of this paper to model examination \nperformance in light of changing school compositions. However, the paper does examine \nchanging compositions as an intrinsically important programme impact. Such an impact \u2013 \nperhaps resulting from heightened popularity of specialist schools combined with the \npermission to select students by aptitude \u2013 could have implications for the exacerbation of a \n\u2018two-tier\u2019 education system and indeed wider social division as a result. \nPrevious research (Exley, 2007) has explored the differing profiles of schools that \nbecame specialist in 2001\/2 and in 2004\/5 and has found that, throughout this period of mass \nspecialist school expansion, growth took the form of an \u2018academic procession\u2019 (Riesman, \n1956) where schools in the most favourable circumstances led the race for specialist status \nand schools in the least favourable circumstances remained \u2018residualised\u2019 as non-specialist. A \nrecent slowing of growth in specialist school numbers plus the fact schools in unfavourable \n 4 \ncircumstances are those failing to gain specialist status\n2\n should in itself give cause for \ngovernment concern. If there is evidence to suggest non-specialist schools have drawn \nincreasingly disadvantaged intakes, this could have implications for both segregation of \npupils between school types and the exacerbation of non-specialist schools\u2019 residualisation. \nSuch potential exacerbation is referred to in this paper as a \u2018drawbridge effect\u2019 because it \ncould mean certain schools will find it increasingly difficult to gain specialist status. \nJournalistic references to the potential exacerbation of a \u2018two-tier\u2019 education system (e.g. \nCassidy, 2001; Slater, 2001; Abrams, 2001) arising from specialist schools post-1997 have so \nfar been lacking in evidence. However, Gorard and Taylor (2001) examined specialist \nschools using data from the Annual School Census (ASC) and found that these schools did \nadmit proportionately fewer children from disadvantaged backgrounds (as measured by Free \nSchool Meal \u2013 FSM \u2013 eligibility) between 1994\/5 and 1999\/00, providing some evidence of a \n\u2018drawbridge effect\u2019. This pattern was found to be particularly the case where specialist \nschools were also their own admissions authorities, for example in the case of foundation, \nvoluntary-aided or grammar schools. The authors argued that \u2018the fact that many specialist \nschools are sited in inner city disadvantaged areas does not, in itself, mean that they serve a \nrepresentative section of the local community\u2019. They expressed concern over expansion of \nthe specialist schools programme. Four years, and the creation of over 1,500 specialist \nschools later, Taylor et al (2005) reiterated these concerns, albeit without new data. Thus, a \nknowledge gap regarding specialist schools after 2001 was identified and the stage was set \nfor further research into the social composition of intakes by school type. \n \n                                                 \n2\n For example, schools in special measures are not permitted to become specialist. Such schools have on \naverage 20 per cent of pupils eligible for FSM, compared with 14 per cent nationally.  \n 5 \nResearch questions \n \nThis paper builds on existing research on the characteristics of specialist and non-specialist \nschools. It examines changing compositions in the period after 2001 but also makes a \nmethodological contribution by using data from the Pupil Level Annual School Census to \nisolate the characteristics of annual Year 7 intakes for different school types. New measures \nof socio-economic positioning have been created by linking pupil postcodes to the Index of \nMultiple Deprivation (IMD). \u2018Segregation ratios\u2019 have been calculated to facilitate \nexamination of pupils from the most and least disadvantaged home postcodes. Questions \naddressed in the paper are as follows: \n \n1. Did specialist schools draw a more privileged intake, comprising greater proportions \nof pupils from the least disadvantaged backgrounds and fewer from the most \ndisadvantaged backgrounds, between 2001\/2 and 2004\/5? \n2. Did non-specialist schools draw a less privileged intake, comprising smaller \nproportions from the least disadvantaged backgrounds and greater proportions from \nthe most disadvantaged backgrounds, between 2001\/2 and 2004\/5? \n3. Were potential changes in intakes between 2001\/2-2004\/5 affected by other school-\nlevel characteristics beyond specialist\/ non-specialist status? \n \nThese questions comprise a test for a \u2018drawbridge effect\u2019 in English secondaries between \n2001\/2 and 2004\/5. Such an effect would mean specialist schools had drawn increasingly \n 6 \nprivileged Year 7 intakes and conversely non-specialist schools had drawn decreasingly \nprivileged Year 7 intakes, perhaps making it more difficult for the latter to become specialist.  \nThe paper is divided is divided into two parts. The first involves descriptive analyses of \npupil segregation and the second involves multivariate analyses in order to ascertain whether \nsegregation patterns can be attributed to specialist or non-specialist status per se. The paper \nbegins by outlining data and methods used. Next, change in simple distributions of Year 7 \npupils from different \u2018disadvantage deciles\u2019 attending specialist and non-specialist schools \nover time is examined. Following on from this, the concept of \u2018segregation\u2019 relative to school \ncompositions is introduced and with it the \u2018segregation ratio\u2019 (SR) as a means for measuring \nsegregation between schools. SR figures for specialist and non-specialist schools are \npresented longitudinally at the national level, separating out \u2018membership effects\u2019 in order to \nisolate any \u2018real\u2019 change in ratios over time. Multivariate analysis is carried out in order to \nshow which school characteristics are those predicting SR change. In particular, OLS \nregression is used to model the potential effects of specialist\/ non-specialist status on SR \nbetween 2001\/2 and 2004\/5.  \n \nData and methods \n \nThe Pupil Level Annual School Census (PLASC)  \n \nDevelopment of the first PLASC in 2001\/2 marked a turning point for research into the social \ncompositions of schools. Initially piloted in 1999\/00, PLASC comprises an annual list of all \npupils in all English schools with data on year group, gender, date of birth, mother tongue, \n 7 \nethnic group, special educational needs and Free School Meal (FSM) eligibility. PLASC also \nincludes a measure for the Census \u2018Output Area\u2019 into which a pupil\u2019s home postcode falls.  \nBefore 2001\/2, comprehensive data on individual pupils did not exist nationally. National \nexaminations of phenomena such as segregation of pupils from different socio-economic \ngroups between schools largely relied on school-level proportions eligible for FSM. It was \nnot possible to break figures down by year group and so Year 7 intakes could not be \nexamined in isolation. In 2001\/2 Philip Noden argued:  \n \n\u2018In the context of the debate on the effects of the quasi-market it would of course be more \ninformative to examine only the Year 7 cohort, that is, changes in the new intake of pupils at \nsecondary schools\u2019 (Noden, 2002: 200). \n \nAnalysis of school compositions in this paper uses the first four years of PLASC, examining \nonly Year 7 intakes. While the relatively short time period here might be considered a \nlimitation, it is hoped this limitation is offset by the use of a method which is more likely \nthan a study of entire school compositions to pick up subtle year-on-year change.  \n \nMapping PLASC onto the IMD \n \nInclusion of the Census \u2018Output Area\u2019 (OA) into which a pupil\u2019s home address falls forms a \nkey advantage to using PLASC in examining the social composition of school intakes. OA \ninformation can be linked to the 2004 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) to provide a \nmeasure of disadvantage for each Year 7 pupil\u2019s neighbourhood. The IMD comprises a \ncomposite measure of seven deprivation \u2018domains\u2019 \u2013 income; employment; health and \n 8 \ndisability; education, skills and training; barriers to housing and services; living environment; \nand crime (Noble et al, 2004). Neighbourhood \u2018ranks\u2019 for the country are produced, so for \neach PLASC pupil there exists a national rank order (where 1 = most disadvantaged) for the \narea in which s\/he lives.  \nWhile existing research on the distribution of different pupils attending different schools \nhas focused on FSM eligibility, this only allows distributions of the most disadvantaged \npupils to be examined. A method linking pupil neighbourhood to the IMD allows distribution \nof pupils experiencing various levels of disadvantage (as inferred from home postcode) to be \nexplored. Significantly, distributions of pupils living in the least disadvantaged \nneighbourhoods can be examined. More generally, there is a case in studying pupil \nsegregation for extending focus from FSM as a (limited \u2013 see Hobbs and Vignoles, 2007) \nmeasure of financial disadvantage to conceptualisations of disadvantage based on wider \n\u2018social exclusion\u2019. Academics have long debated the relative merits of a reconfiguration of \n\u2018poverty\u2019 in this multi-dimensional direction as exemplified in the 1997 Government \nestablishment of the Social Exclusion Unit (see Room, 1999; Hills et al, 2002).  \n \nAnalysis Caveats \n \nIt is not the purpose of this paper to model causal processes by which schools might draw \nmore \u2018privileged\u2019 intakes. Data deployed are not detailed enough at the school level to test \nfor such processes. There is, for example, no data on individual school admissions criteria. \nAnalysis merely seeks to highlight trends in specialist and non-specialist intakes and \nmultivariate analysis seeks to identify some school-level characteristics associated with these \n 9 \ntrends. Explanations posited for change over time should be considered tentative, although \nevidence presented does point to the need for future research exploring the processes beyond \nschool-level characteristics that give rise to changing school compositions. \nIt is also important to remember that what is under-examination is not the \u2018starting \npoints\u2019 of schools in terms of disadvantaged intake at fixed time points. These will vary for \nnumerous reasons, not least the impact of residential segregation given the chosen measure of \n\u2018proportions from disadvantaged postcodes\u2019. This paper is concerned with trends in Year 7 \nintakes for specialist\/ non-specialist schools. A school may have admitted low proportions \nfrom disadvantaged postcodes for the last ten years. Indeed, it may be that there are few \ndisadvantaged postcodes nearby from which it could reasonably draw pupils. It is change in \nintake with respect to specialist\/ non-specialist status and the exacerbation of existing \ndisadvantage that this paper seeks to address. \n \nDescriptive explorations of segregation  \n \nConsidering the Intake of Different School Types: An Initial Look at Proportions \n \nTable 1 shows the composition of specialist and non-specialist schools in 2001\/2, 2002\/3, \n2003\/4 and 2004\/5. \u2018Composition\u2019 here denotes basic proportions of pupils for each school \ntype who fall into each of the ten \u2018deciles of disadvantage\u2019 as calculated using IMD rankings \nfor Year 7 pupil neighbourhoods. A value of 1 within this scale indicates pupils whose \npostcodes fall into the ten per cent of neighbourhoods with the highest levels of disadvantage \n 10 \nin England. A value of 10 indicates pupils whose postcodes fall into those ten per cent of \nneighbourhoods with the lowest levels of disadvantage.  \n \nTABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nFrom the table, it can be seen that in 2001\/2 the distribution of Year 7 pupils falling into \ndifferent deciles of disadvantage was skewed towards the more disadvantaged deciles for \nboth specialist and non-specialist schools (essentially a function of densely populated poorer \nareas plus the fact this data does not include private schools). However, this skew was more \nmarked for non-specialist schools which had greater proportions of their Year 7 intake than \nspecialist schools falling into the most disadvantaged deciles and smaller proportions than \nspecialist schools falling into the least disadvantaged deciles. A similar pattern can be seen \nfor specialist schools in 2002\/3, but the distribution for non-specialist schools has become \nfurther skewed towards pupils from the disadvantaged deciles. Fourteen per cent of non-\nspecialist schools\u2019 intake in 2002\/3 was made up of those from the most disadvantaged decile \ncompared with just 8.5 per cent from the least disadvantaged decile. The figures for specialist \nschools in this year were 11.9 and 11.3 per cent, respectively. By 2003\/4 patterns for \nspecialist schools still remained stable but for non-specialist schools 15 per cent of their Year \n7 intake were now in the most disadvantaged decile compared with just 7.9 per cent in the \nleast disadvantaged decile. Finally, this pattern was exacerbated even further in 2004\/5 with \nstable figures for specialist schools but 17.1 per cent of non-specialist school pupils falling \ninto the most disadvantaged decile and only 6.3 per cent in the least disadvantaged decile. \n 11 \nOverall, Table 1 shows relatively stable proportions attending different school types \namong middling deciles of disadvantage between 2001\/2 and 2004\/5. However, the \nproportion of specialist schools\u2019 Year 7 intake that is made up of those from the most \ndisadvantaged decile of neighbourhoods became marginally smaller over time. Conversely, \nthe proportion of non-specialist schools\u2019 Year 7 intake made from the same group became \nlarger over time. The proportion of specialist schools made up of those from the least \ndisadvantaged decile of neighbourhoods has remained stable, whereas this group constituted \na shrinking proportion of non-specialist schools\u2019 Year 7 intake between 2001\/2 and 2004\/5. \nThus, patterns of distribution between the deciles for specialist and non-specialist schools \nare divergent over time. In 2001\/2 the sum of differences in proportions between the school \ntypes was just 7 per cent, whereas in 2004\/5 it was 26 per cent. Such changes over time could \nrelate to the combined effects of parental choice and school admissions or they could relate \nto the types of schools which were specialist\/ non-specialist in each year. These ideas are \ndiscussed further below.  \n \nUsing the Segregation Ratio (SR) to Examine School Compositions \n \nBuilding on basic considerations of pupils in different disadvantage deciles attending \nspecialist\/ non-specialist schools, we now focus specifically on pupil segregation between \nschools, which has received much academic attention in recent years. In 1988, Massey and \nDenton described five conceptually distinct \u2018dimensions\u2019 of segregation \u2013 \u2018evenness\u2019, \n\u2018exposure\u2019, \u2018concentration\u2019, \u2018centralisation\u2019 and \u2018clustering\u2019. \u2018Evenness\u2019 between schools has \nbeen defined by Croxford and Paterson (2006) as \u2018whether a group is over-represented in \n 12 \nsome schools, and under-represented in others\u2019 (p. 384) and this paper focuses on Year 7 \nsegregation between specialist and non-specialist schools in terms of evenness.  \nMultiplicative approaches to educational segregation have traditionally taken the form of \nstandard indices based on dichotomous categorical variables. Within the recent \u2018Index Wars\u20193 \nit might be argued that the Segregation Ratio (SR), utilised by Gorard and Fitz (2000a) and \nGorard and Taylor (2001), has been unfairly overlooked as an \u2018evenness\u2019 segregation \nmeasure. Noden (2000) pointed out that area summary level segregation measures simply \nindicate the proportion of pupils within a defined locality that would have to move schools in \norder to ensure an even spread of a certain characteristic. They do not indicate from which \nschools pupils would have to move.  \nBy contrast, this is exactly the issue addressed by SR \u2013 a simple probability ratio giving a \nmeasure for each school and indicating whether or not the school is taking more or less than \nits \u2018fair share\u2019 of particular types of pupils within a defined locality: in this paper the local \nLEA. SR is a comparison of proportions of pupils with a certain characteristic in a school \nwith area-level proportions for the same characteristic. A value of greater than 1 indicates a \nschool is taking more than its fair share; a value of less than one indicates it is taking less \nthan its fair share. This ratio is standardised so differences in overall levels of poverty both \nover time and between localities are accommodated, enabling trajectories of segregation for \nindividual schools and also aggregated school types to be traced. Calculations of SR in this \npaper are based on two central characteristics, each \u2018binary\u2019 in nature: 1) Year 7 pupils \nliving\/ not living in the 20 per cent most disadvantaged postcodes in England; 2) Year 7 \n                                                 \n3\n This refers to debates over area summary level segregation measures such as the Dissimilarity Index; also to \ndebates over the modelling of segregation.

Looking at \nthe first row in Table 2, it can be observed that specialist schools consistently admitted \nfewer than their \u2018fair share\u2019 of Year 7 pupils from disadvantaged postcodes and that there \nwas little change in this pattern (+0.007) over time. By contrast, looking at the third row \nwithin Table 2, non-specialist schools in 2001\/2 admitted more than their fair share of pupils \n                                                 \n4\n The IMD is essentially an index measuring disadvantage; it does not include specific indicators of wealth and \nadvantage. Thus, what is measured in this paper is not disadvantage and advantage per se; rather disadvantage \nand an absence of disadvantage. The word \u2018advantage\u2019 is therefore kept in inverted commas throughout. \n5\n For calculating SR, binary characteristics for pupils were required. This meant switching from considering \ndeciles of disadvantage to categorising pupils as either disadvantaged or not disadvantaged\/ \u2018advantaged\u2019 or not \n\u2018advantaged\u2019. The \u2018bottom 20 per cent\u2019 and \u2018top 20 per cent\u2019 cut off points were chosen because selecting only \nthe bottom and top 10 per cent would have yielded too many missing SR values (i.e. where no pupil in a school \nor LEA lived in one of these neighbourhoods).  \n6\n Numbers in brackets in all tables indicate standard errors around SRs.  \n 14 \nfrom disadvantaged postcodes and this pattern became more marked between the baseline \nyear and 2004\/5. This provides some indication of divergence in the profile of specialist and \nnon-specialist schools.  \n \nTABLES 2 and 3 ABOUT HERE \n \nTable 3 which looks at distribution of Year 7 pupils from the most \u2018advantaged\u2019 postcodes \ntells a different story. Looking at the first row, it can be seen that in 2001\/2 specialist \nschools admitted more than their fair share of these pupils. In 2004\/5 specialist schools still \nadmitted more than their fair share of pupils from \u2018advantaged\u2019 postcodes but the figure was \nlower. This suggests specialist intakes became more reflective of local populations between \n2001\/2 and 2004\/5, although it should be stressed change was not significant.\n7\n Perhaps more \ninteresting is what happened to the presence of pupils from \u2018advantaged\u2019 home postcodes in \nnon-specialist schools between 2001\/2 and 2004\/5. Looking at the third row in Table 3, in \n2001\/2 these schools drew fewer than their fair share of pupils from \u2018advantaged\u2019 postcodes \n(0.919) but this was exacerbated over time and in 2004\/5 the same figure was 0.717 \u2013 a \nchange of -0.202 in three years and a departure from the trend for all secondaries, not to \nmention divergence from the trend for specialist schools.  \nWhile specialist schools did not draw fewer pupils from disadvantaged neighbourhoods \nover time relative to \u2018fair shares\u2019, nor indeed did they draw greater proportions of pupils from \n                                                 \n7\n Data in this paper comprised all Year 7 pupils within all \u2018standard\u2019 English secondary schools. Gorard and \nFitz (2000a) argue that statistical significance does not apply where data comprises a population census. \nHowever, Croxford and Paterson (2006) argue the need to view even census data as a sample of some larger \n\u2018hyper-population\u2019 and thus analysis controls for \u2018worlds that might have been\u2019. Difference of means tests were \nutilised in descriptive analysis in order to identify p-values for longitudinal change. Significance at the p \uf0a3 0.05 \nand p \uf0a3 0.01 levels are reported in multivariate analysis (Tables 6 and 7).   \n 15 \nthese neighbourhoods. Specialist schools did slightly reduce the margin by which they were \ntaking more than their fair share of Year 7 pupils from \u2018advantaged\u2019 neighbourhoods, but in \n2004\/5 they still drew markedly more than their fair share of these pupils. Meanwhile, there \nis a small amount of evidence for a \u2018drawbridge effect\u2019 in that non-specialist schools have \ndrawn less privileged intakes over time. However, there exists an important caveat to these \nfindings: namely the changing profiles of specialist and non-specialist schools as two distinct \ngroups, particularly with respect to expanding numbers of specialist schools. \nIn terms of \u2018fair shares\u2019 of pupils from particular neighbourhoods, expansion in the \noverall proportion of English secondaries which are specialist between 2001\/2 and 2004\/5 \nwill automatically have led specialist schools as a group towards less privileged Year 7 \nintakes. This is because local populations will naturally reflect the intake of whichever school \ntype (specialist or non-specialist) is in the majority. SR change which can be attributed to \nsimple changing membership of the specialist group of schools is referred to here as \n\u2018membership effects\u2019.  \nIn examining changing specialist and non-specialist school Year 7 intakes, it is important \nto consider changing \u2018membership\u2019 between the two groups over the period 2001\/2-2004\/5. \nOne way of controlling for changing membership over time is to isolate only those schools \nwhich remained either specialist or non-specialist throughout, without switching status. \nWhile the first and third rows in Tables 2 and 3 show changing SRs for the entire (growing) \nbody of specialist schools\/ the entire (shrinking) body of non-specialist schools in each year, \nthe second rows show corresponding figures only for those schools that had been specialist \nback in 2001\/2 and remained that way throughout. The fourth rows show SR figures only \nfor those schools which were non-specialist in 2001\/2 and still non-specialist in 2004\/5.  \n 16 \nTables 2 and 3 show clearly that much change over time in Year 7 intakes can be \naccounted for by \u2018membership effects\u2019 in specialist and non-specialist groups. Once these are \ncontrolled for, change is not significant at the p<0.05 level and simple trendless fluctuation is \nobserved. With respect to non-specialist schools, those that remained non-specialist \nthroughout 2001\/2 \u2013 2004\/5 did take an increasing amount of their \u2018fair share\u2019 from \ndisadvantaged neighbourhoods, but this was only +0.028 rather than +0.225 for all non-\nspecialist schools over the period. Similarly, non-specialist schools did take even fewer \npupils from \u2018advantaged\u2019 neighbourhoods over this period, but the decline was just -0.039 \ncompared with -0.202. Findings to support the notion of a \u2018drawbridge effect\u2019 here are weak.  \nFor specialist schools, what initially looked to be a pattern of these moving slightly \ntowards their fair share of Year 7 pupils from \u2018advantaged\u2019 neighbourhoods now appears to \nhave been a \u2018membership effect\u2019. Schools which were specialist throughout 2001\/2 \u2013 2004\/5 \ndid draw a less \u2018advantaged\u2019 intake over this time period but change was marginal, and the \ndistribution of disadvantaged intake for specialist schools is confirmed as being stable. It \nshould be noted here, however, that an absence of change also negates the notion that \nspecialist schools have drawn intakes more reflective of local \u2018fair shares\u2019 over time as \nexpected given rising specialist school numbers.  \nTable 4 reports SR trends for schools that became specialist in individual years between \n2001\/2 and 2004\/5 in order to untangle patterns for specialist schools excluded from analysis \nin Tables 2 and 3. Baseline figures are presented in bold (for all years except 2001\/2 where \nthe data did not permit a baseline) in order to indicate aggregate mean SRs the year before \nschools became specialist. Again trendless fluctuation is observed, with no significant trend \nfor schools that became specialist in any year.  \n 17 \n \nTABLE 4 ABOUT HERE \n \nFigures presented from this point onwards refer only to schools that did not \u2018switch status\u2019 \nbetween 2001\/2 and 2004\/5.  \n \nModelling change in segregation ratios over time \n \nIn the SR analysis by specialist\/ non-specialist school type above, it has been demonstrated \nthat trends in ratios may be little more than a function of \u2018membership effects\u2019, i.e. the rising \nnumber of specialist schools between 2001\/2 and 2004\/5, because local populations will \nnaturally reflect the intake of whichever type of school is in the majority.  \nHowever, previous descriptive analysis (Exley, 2007) has shown there is an interesting \nstory to be told within specialist schools, because certain specialist school types have become \nmore reflective of local populations in their intakes whereas others have not. Indeed, contrary \nto the trend of expanding specialist school numbers, some specialist school types have \nbecome less reflective of local populations. What were the characteristics of these specialist \nschools? Table 5 outlines key subgroup characteristics of specialist and non-specialist \nschools by which SR trends were examined.  \n \nTABLE 5 ABOUT HERE \n \n 18 \nOverall, descriptive subgroup analysis of SR trends between 2001\/2 and 2004\/5 confirmed a \npicture of trendless fluctuation for both the disadvantaged and \u2018advantaged\u2019 SRs.8 However, \nthere did exist some tentative patterns. Secondary modern schools drew fewer pupils from \ndisadvantaged neighbourhoods over time, while faith schools in their various forms showed \ndivergence in intakes over time between those with specialist and non-specialist status. \nWithin language colleges there was an increase in \u2018advantaged\u2019 intake relative to fair shares, \nwhereas within non-specialist schools which were under-subscribed or had high expenditure, \nhigh proportions on FSM or poor GCSE performance, there were decreasing \u2018advantaged\u2019 \nintakes. Taken together, this amounts to some small evidence of a \u2018drawbridge effect\u2019 \nbetween specialist and non-specialist schools. \nStill, it remains to be seen whether SR change can be attributed to the effect of having \ngained specialist status per se, or indeed whether change is simply an artefact of other school \ncharacteristics that might affect intakes. Here OLS regression models are used in order to \nuntangle the effects of various independent variables on two dependent variables \u2013 changing \ndisadvantaged and \u2018advantaged\u2019 SRs between 2001\/2 and 2004\/5. During this period, certain \nschools became more \u2018exclusive\u2019 with respect to the two ratios, others became less so. What \nfactors predict positive or negative change? Does specialist status emerge as a key factor? If \nso, is this effect significant? \nTables 6 and 7 show linear regression models which predict change in \u2018disadvantaged\u2019 \nand \u2018advantaged\u2019 SRs respectively between 2001\/2 and 2004\/5.9 Independent variables \nmirror those in Table 5, save for two added sets of variables: \n \n                                                 \n8 Here the terms \u2018disadvantaged SR\u2019 and \u2018\u2018advantaged\u2019 SR\u2019 describe the two dependent variables calculated for \neach school according to specified formulae earlier in the paper (see Tables 2 and 3 respectively).  \n9\n Regressions were carried out on change in logged SRs because this provided more normal value distributions.  \n 19 \n1. Specialist\/ non-specialist status: only schools that were specialist\/ non-specialist \nthroughout the whole time period counted as \u20191\u2019 for these dummy variables (i.e. 1,150 \n\u2018switchers\u2019 counted as zero for both). Thus the variables are not mutually exclusive and \nboth can be included in a single regression  \n2. SR figures as they stood in 2001\/2: useful for predicting trajectories of SR change. \n \nPositive coefficients in the tables denote a relationship between schools\u2019 possession of a \ncharacteristic and SR increase \u2013 i.e. taking proportionately more of a \u2018fair share\u2019 of Year 7 \npupils from disadvantaged (Table 6) or \u2018advantaged\u2019 (Table 7) backgrounds over time. \nNegative coefficients denote a relationship between possession of a characteristic and SR \ndecrease \u2013 i.e. taking less of a \u2018fair share\u2019 of certain pupils over time. Within Tables 6 and 7 \nonly those coefficients which emerged as statistically significant at the 0.05 or 0.01 level are \nreported. However, specialist and non-specialist status are reported whether significant or not \nbecause they are central to the concerns of the paper.  \n \nTABLE 6 ABOUT HERE \n \nFrom Table 6 it can be seen that change in the disadvantaged SR is strongly predicted by a \nschool\u2019s SR position in 2001\/2. Schools admitting fewer Year 7 pupils from disadvantaged \nneighbourhoods in 2001\/2 admitted greater proportions relative to fair shares over time, \nwhereas schools admitting greater proportions of these pupils in 2001\/2 admitted smaller \nproportions over time. More notably, however, it can be seen that higher baseline \nexamination results and school improvement were associated with drawing decreasing \n 20 \nproportions of disadvantaged intake. Improvement in results simultaneous to decreasing \nproportions of disadvantaged intake might be expected here given 2002 neighbourhood Key \nStage 2, 3 and 4 examination scores are among the deprivation measures included in the 2004 \nIMD. Still, decreasing disadvantaged intakes in schools which already had strong \nexamination scores is something that ought to alert government concern. Rural schools and \nfoundation schools (the latter here have greater autonomy over admissions than do schools \nsuch as community schools) both drew significantly decreasing proportions of disadvantaged \nYear 7 pupils relative to fair shares between 2001\/2 and 2004\/5.  \nNevertheless, importantly for this paper, neither specialist nor non-specialist status \nappeared to make a difference in predicting disadvantaged SR change over time. While some \nschool types as outlined above could certainly be confirmed as drawing smaller proportions \nof Year 7 pupils living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods relative to fair shares over time, this \nwas not a characteristic associated with schools possessing specialist status per se. There is \nno evidence in Table 6 for a \u2018drawbridge effect\u2019 whereby non-specialist schools draw \nincreasingly disadvantaged intakes rendering it even more difficult for them to gain the \n\u2018additionality\u2019 associated with specialist status.  \nConsidering the \u2018advantaged\u2019 SR between 2001\/2 and 2004\/5, Table 7 shows that a \nmoderate amount of variance is explained by the \u2018starting point\u2019 ratio in 2001\/2 (a coefficient \nof -0.422) meaning that schools which previously admitted a lower proportion of Year 7 \npupils from \u2018advantaged\u2019 neighbourhoods relative to their fair share, tended to admit greater \nproportions in 2004\/5. Conversely, those schools that admitted a greater proportion of pupils \nfrom \u2018advantaged\u2019 neighbourhoods in 2001\/2 admitted fewer of these in 2004\/5. However, \nthere were also significant negative effects for grammar schools and girls\u2019 schools. \n 21 \nSecondary modern schools drew more \u2018advantaged\u2019 intakes relative to fair shares over time, \nalthough the extent to which this represents schools becoming less reflective of local \npopulations depends on schools\u2019 starting points. Denominational or \u2018faith\u2019 schools drew less \n\u2018advantaged\u2019 intakes over time. This was in strong contrast with schools which had strong \nbaseline examination performance in 2001\/2 which again were shown to draw more \n\u2018advantaged\u2019 intakes over time. Quite unsurprisingly, and of notable concern given \ngovernment rhetoric on school improvement in England, those schools which improved most \nin terms of GCSE performance between 2001\/2 and 2004\/5 were also those which drew \nincreasing proportions of pupils from \u2018advantaged\u2019 neighbourhoods (i.e. those where local \nexamination performance \u2013 among other things \u2013 is strong) relative to their local fair shares \nof these pupils. \n \nTABLE 7 ABOUT HERE \n \nAgain, it is important here to note the lack of a significant impact of specialist or non-\nspecialist status on change in the \u2018advantaged\u2019 SR. Schools which became specialist between \n1997 and 1999 were weakly positively associated with an increase, but this change was \nsignificant only at the p<0.09 level. Such a lack of evidence for the power of specialist status \nas a predictor of SR change ties in with Table 6 findings predicting trends in \u2018disadvantaged\u2019 \nSRs where again no evidence was found for specialist schools drawing more privileged \nintakes over time nor indeed non-specialist schools drawing less privileged intakes. On the \ndistribution of Year 7 pupils living in \u2018advantaged\u2019 neighbourhoods, then, it can be \n 22 \nconcluded that, while some school types have drawn marginally more privileged intakes and \nothers marginally less privileged intakes, this has not been a result of specialist status.  \n \nConclusions  \n \nGovernment evaluations of specialist schools in recent years have focused on examination \nperformance, arguably at the expense of evaluations considering the schools\u2019 potential \nimpact on segregation. So far, research on specialist schools and segregation has been scant. \nThis is surprising given media and academic criticism since 1997 on the potential for the \nschools to exacerbate a \u2018two tier\u2019 system of education. It is also surprising because \nsegregation of pupils with certain characteristics could have implications for school \nimprovement and it could be considered an intrinsically negative policy by-product given its \nimplications for community, social cohesion and inclusion.  \nThis paper set out to examine the extent to which specialist schools were between 2001\/2 \nand 2004\/5 drawing more privileged Year 7 intakes and the extent to which non-specialist \nschools were drawing less privileged intakes, potentially rendering it more difficult for non-\nspecialist schools to gain specialist status. Has such an effect occurred? Overall the answer \nhas to be no. Early reports of increased tendencies towards more privileged intakes among \nspecialist schools between 1994\/5 and 1999\/00 (Gorard and Taylor, 2001) were not \nconfirmed in this paper for the period 2001\/2 to 2004\/5, although it should be stressed that \ndifferent methods were adopted here. Controlling for \u2018membership effects\u2019 to take into \naccount specialist school expansion, it was shown that specialist schools did not draw smaller \nproportions of pupils from disadvantaged neighbourhoods relative to fair shares over time, \n 23 \nnor did they draw greater proportions of pupils from \u2018advantaged\u2019 neighbourhoods. \nSimilarly, non-specialist schools did not draw greater proportions from disadvantaged \nneighbourhoods and nor did they draw smaller proportions from \u2018advantaged\u2019 \nneighbourhoods.  \nDoes this mean that early fears over the potential for specialist schools in England to \nexacerbate a \u2018two-tier\u2019 education system may now be considered overblown? While \ndescriptive tables in this paper showed that segregation of pupils from disadvantaged and \n\u2018advantaged\u2019 neighbourhoods between specialist and non-specialist schools does exist, this is \nperhaps a function of wider social\/ educational stratification, and the paper found no \nevidence that specialist\/ non-specialist segregation is increasing over time. However, nor is \nsuch segregation decreasing, and it could be regressive in policy terms to grant positional \nadvantage plus extra funding within a competitive educational marketplace to schools with \nprivileged intakes while schools without such intakes struggle to gain such advantage. \nConsideration must be given by government to schools with disadvantaged intakes that do \nnot yet have specialist status (Exley, 2007). These schools may not face a \u2018drawbridge\u2019 effect \nthrough increasingly disadvantaged intakes but, because of wider stratification, they still face \ndifficulty achieving specialist status given their positional disadvantage.  \nIn the long term, it might be that the specialist schools programme overall in England will \nprove less harmful than some critics have suggested but also less helpful than government \nadvocates have suggested. However, now that the programme has expanded to an extent \nwhere specialist status is no longer \u2018special\u2019 and indeed not possessing specialist status might \nconfer a negative badge of stigma, what are the segregation implications of new \u2018tiers\u2019 of \nfunding and additionality within the programme, such as \u2018high performing\u2019, \u2018combined\u2019 or \n 24 \n\u2018training\u2019 specialist status? What are the segregation implications of those specialist schools \nwhich make specific use of permission to select by aptitude (up to 10 per cent of specialist \nschools according to Coldron et al, 2001)? Moreover, what are the segregation implications \nof other initiatives within the Labour agenda for educational choice and diversity, such as \nacademies, foundation schools, faith schools and trust schools? Perhaps new \u2018badges of \nadditionality\u2019 will arise where schools have large proportions of pupils registered on \ngovernment \u2018Gifted and Talented\u2019 programmes indicating the presence of children with \nparents rich in cultural and economic capital (Tomlinson, 2008; Campbell et al, 2007). We \nhave already seen that certain schools \u2013 including those with strong and\/ or improving \nexamination results (therefore more likely to succeed in gaining future labels of positional \nadvantage akin to specialist status) and those with foundation status \u2013 have drawn more \nprivileged Year 7 intakes over time. Such findings may relate to emerging associations \nbetween possession of Foundation status in a school and \u2018exclusionary\u2019 admissions practices \nsuch as selection by aptitude\/ ability (see West et al, 2004). It is unlikely that school \npossession of such labels as \u2018academy\u2019 or \u2018trust school\u2019 will expand to the hitherto \nunprecedented degree that specialist status did, so the potential for some to exacerbate \u2018two-\ntier\u2019 elements in English secondary education may well exist. Such policy-relevant questions \nwill require careful monitoring in future work on pupil segregation. It is suggested the \nmethod for measuring segregation trends presented in this paper provides a useful tool for \nundertaking such a task. \n \n \n \n 25 \nReferences \n \nAbrams, F.
