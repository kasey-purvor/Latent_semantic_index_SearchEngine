The emerging multi-ethnic (multi-\ncultural\/multi-faith!) schools will continue to be a sure phenomenon in countries like \nBritain, in the backdrop of international socio-eco-political developments. Managing \nmultiple and diverse ethnicities and identities is emerging as a serious issue for access \nand inclusion. This paper pleads for developing an understanding of the learners\u2019 \nidentities in the British schools, and argues that this has profound implications for the \neducational leaders working towards an agenda for inclusion and achievement. The \npaper aspires to draw attention to a developing situation, which has the inherent \npotential of growing more sensitive and complex. \n \nHowever, in view of the vast diversity of ethnicities, and within\/across-groups \ndynamics that challenge categorisations, it is beyond the scope of this paper to attempt \nanything highly ambitious. I intend to concentrate on one group, loosely defined as \nMuslim learners. My choosing to focus on this group of school population is \ninfluenced by my being a Muslim educationist, with claims of access to religious \nknowledge and texts (Shah 1999), which I perceive as valuable in exploring the issues \nin a wider theoretical and philosophical context. Secondly, having worked in HE in an \nIslamic state for more than two decades has helped me gain an understanding of the \nMuslim learners\u2019 perceptions and expectations, and the interface between leaders, \nlearners and community. In the British context, multiple social, economic, strategic, \nhistorical and political factors have added to the complexities of interface, more so in \nthe post 9\/11 and 7\/7 world, making the management of \u2018Muslim identity\u2019 a sensitive \nissue. Thirdly, there are 1.8 million Muslims in Britain (The Guardian 2002), and \nunlike some other faith groups, Muslims tend to highlight their religious identity \n(Brah 1996; Jacobson 1998; Modood 1990; Modood et al 1997; Nielsen 1987). \nAccording to the national statistics (2001), 33.8% of the Muslims are aged 0-15 years \nand thus fall within the compulsory education age. It is important that any association \nbetween the ethnicity\/identity and educational performance\/achievement of these \n 2 \nstudents should not foreclose the possibilities of investigating the impact of leadership \nvalues, perceptions and practices on how these students experience education in this \nspecific context. \n \nThe paper argues for increased understanding of the learners\u2019 perceptions and \nexpectations for enhancing and sustaining effective leadership. Leadership values and \npractices formulated at the interstices of expectations and responses have particular \nsignificance for vulnerable groups who feel marginalised or \u2018misunderstood\u2019. An \ninformed awareness of this impact can improve leadership responses and might \ncontribute to improved leadership role. \n \nThe paper discusses ethnicity\/identity with a focus on the Muslim students in the \nBritish schools, the related issues and tensions. How the identities are constructed, \nprojected or imposed reflects a complex interplay of myriad factors. The emerging \nidentities refuse to fit within prescribed categories of race\/ethnicity, highlighting the \nneed for the educational leaders to develop an understanding of ethnicities and \n\u2018identities\u2019. The management of students\u2019 identity, and the interplay among ethnicity, \nidentity, achievement and school leadership are some of the issues looked at in the \nsecond section. The final section offers some suggestions for leaders in multiethnic \nschools. \n \nMuslim Students in British Schools \n \nThe radical changes taking place in the world around us are being reflected in the \nchanging demographics in the British schools. My focus is explicitly on the secondary \nschool students faced with a growing awareness of \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018identity\u2019, and the \nassociated constructions and assumptions. According to Piaget (1969), this age phase \nconcurs with the ability to think logically and to reason, and this reasoning becomes \nactive in shaping and challenging identity constructions. As awareness of identity \ntakes shape in the unsympathetic, rather cruel (Macpherson 1999), adolescent world of \nsecondary schools, where the dominant values, practices, assumptions, and even the \nwider relevance of national curriculum to ethnicities, all become challenged overtly or \ncovertly, making the educational sites locations for the interplay of competing notions \nand discourses (Foucault 1977, 1980). \n 3 \n \nMuslim students are a unique multi-ethnic group, defying the race\/ethnicity categories \n(Afridi 2001) with claims to a transnational (Muslim Parliament 1992; Siddiqui \n1992), cosmic (Mernissi 1991), or super-ordinate identity (Hopkins and Hopkins \n2004). There is abundant literature on identity in sociology, social psychology and \nfeminist theory (Bhabha 1994; Brah 1996; Braidotti 1991, 1992, 1994; Giddens 1993, \n1996; Gilroy 1992; Hall 1993, 1996; Hall and de Gay 1996; Hopkins and Kahani-\nHopkins 2004; Kahani-Hopkins and Hopkins 2002; Papastergiadis 1998; Tajfel 1978; \nVincent 2003), presenting different theories, and analysing the factors involved. \nHowever, recognition of religion as a category of influence for identity construction \nin the recent scenario is not a fully explored phenomenon. There are increasing \ncomplaints of prioritizing ethnic and racial over religious groups and the \ncomplications emerging from that approach (Modood 1990). The revival of religions \nor religious resurgence in the post-modern world (Ahmed 1992; Ahmed and Donnan \n1994; Bauman 1997, 1997a; Esposito 2002; Kepel 1997, 2003), and the heightened \n\u2018political\u2019 conflicts in the wake of 9\/11 with reference to Islam and \u2018Muslim identity\u2019 \nhighlight the significance to enquire into this sensitive area and its implications for \nschool leadership. The sad events of July 7\nth\n (London Bombing 2005) are another \nsignal that the educational leaders need to address these issue on urgent basis to \nensure the democratic fabric of future society. These are indicators of \u2018possible risks, \n[and] \u2018we\u2019 face a responsibility\u2019 (van Loon 2000:176) to explore the sources of risk \nwith open and fair minds, setting aside all easy assumptions. Beck argues that \u2018The \ndiscourse of risk begins where trust in our security and belief in progress end\u2019 \n(2000:213), and one way to rebuild and strengthen trust is to enhance understanding, \nparticularly of self-perceptions and identity constructions. \n \nIdentity: a construction \n \nThe debates around identity, multiple-self, and static\/dynamic identity highlight the \nneed to understand the interplay of forces involved in identity formulations and the \nresulting impact on academic performance of ethnic groups. Giddens posits that \u2018A \nself-identity has to be created and more or less continually reordered against the \nbackdrop of shifting experiences of day-to-day life and the fragmenting tendencies of \nmodern institutions\u2019 (1991:186). This reinforces the argument that \u2018identity is fluid, \n 4 \nnot fixed; multiple, not single; and transforming, not static\u2019 (Vincent 2003:5). Identity \nconfigurations occur at individual, group, community, country or international levels, \nand the interplay with race, ethnicity, religion and many others is a complex \nphenomenon. Identities keep changing as the nature of political and economic \nrelationships changes between groups, communities and countries, and impact on \nparticipation in the public as well.  \n \nThe drive towards a super-ordinate Muslim identity is international in dimensions \nincluding countries like China (Alles 2003; Chiang 2001; Djao 2004), America \n(Afridi 2001), Britain (Jacobson 1998; Hopkins and Hopkins 2004), France (Le \nBreton 1999; Limage 2000; Tlem\u00e7ani 1997), and many others (Haddad 2002; Kepel \n1997; 2003; Modood and Werbner 1997). The concept of Islamic Ummah provides \nthe basis for this super-ordinate identity to an otherwise hugely diversely community. \nThe root word of Ummah is Umm, which means 'mother' in Arabic (Ahmed 1992). \nThere are sixty-four occurrences of the term in the Quran (Al-Ahsan 1992), where it is \nused as an overarching concept for wider Muslim community operative beyond geo-\npolitical bounds. Commonly, this term is used among Muslims to convey the fact that \nall Muslims the world over constitute one Ummah or community irrespective of the \ndifferences of gender, race, tribe, colour, dress, language and many others (the Quran; \nsee also Geaves 1996: chapters II and III; Iqbal 1996), and accept the Quran as the \nguiding philosophy.  \nAn appreciation of the concept and its implications has relevance for understanding \nMuslim learners\u2019 self-constructions and could be helpful in understanding their \nexpectations and responses, particularly within the discourses of political Islam. \nSecondly, it can be usefully availed for developing \u2018diversity-friendly\u2019 teaching\/learning \nenvironment by drawing upon the associated values underpinned by notions of \n\u2018knowledge status\u2019, ideological commitment to \u2018knowledge\u2019 and relationship between \nteacher\/learner. \nThe concept of Ummah provides the philosophical underpinnings, supported by the \nQuranic insistence on equality and oneness, and is enacted in the most intimate details \nof daily life where culture and religion become inseparable for Muslims (Abdullah \n1982; Jacobson 1997; Shah 1998). However, the interesting contradiction is a \nheightening awareness of \u2018super ordinate\u2019 religious identity in a post-modern era \n 5 \npredicated upon a falling apart of \u2018unified world-views of religion and metaphysics\u2019 \n(Habermas 1985:9). Is this engagement with identity projection and construction a \nnew \u2018force of resistance\u2019 (Hall 1992) - in the category of gender, race, ethnicity, and \ncolour - fighting for legitimacy (Habermas 1976)? Is this an expression of what \nMernissi (1993) calls \u2018political Islam\u2019, in the \u2018new world order\u2019 scenario? It is \nimportant to engage with these debates to enhance understanding and leadership of \nthe new school context. \n \nCreating of identities is conditioned by affiliations, associations and by what Hall \ncalls \u2018histories\u2019: \n\u2018\u2026 identities are the names we give to different ways we are positioned by, \nand position ourselves within the narratives of the past\u2019. (Hall 1993:394) \n \nBut this \u2018creating\u2019 is also determined by \u2018in opposition to what\u2019 and \u2018by whom\u2019 at a \nparticular time in \u2018history\u2019. Modood (2005) argues: \nIt is a politics of projecting identities in order to challenge racism and existing \npower relations; of seeking not just toleration for ethnic difference, but also \npublic acknowledgement, resources and representation.  \nThe development of political identity, especially among the young Muslims, as evident \nin Britain and elsewhere, is linked in some ways to religious revival (Saeed et al, 1999), \nbut it also needs to be viewed in the backdrop of wider historical, political, and economic \ndevelopments. The mention of crusades by George W. Bush in a post 9\/11 context \npositioned the identities of the parties engaged in conflict across a politico-religious \ndivide, requiring enormous diplomatic activity on the part of the USA to manoeuvre \nunderstanding across the implied super-ordinate identity configurations. The example \npoints to the immense sensitivity and complexity of political identity formulations and \nhow these lend to political exploitation. The perception among the Muslims, \nparticularly among the youth, of being \u2018targeted\u2019  (Ahmed 2003; Esposito 2002a; \nHagopian 2004) in the wake of post 9\/11, and the processes such as special \nregistration, police raids\/interrogations, profiling of Muslims, and \u2018stop & search\u2019 \npractices targeting particular Muslim groups (MPA 2004) have left them feeling \ninsecure and even paranoid. Shooting by police of a Brazilian who looked Asian in \npost 7\/7 England, police activities to track terrorists, and increasing fears and \n 6 \ninsecurities among Muslim community in different parts of the country, all demand \nvery careful analysis. Why these young people, born and educated within the British \neducation system are driven to such desperate measures? Why are they putting their \nlives and future at risk? What are their experiences in educational institutions, or in \nthe wider society, and how these impact identity formulations?  \n \nProcess of identification is located in time and context, and as Melucci argues, \n\u2018definition of its borders and maintenance of its continuity are entrusted to our \ncapacity to respond \u2013 that is, to our ability to recognise and choose among the \nopportunities and constraints present in the field of relations that constitute us at any \ngiven moment\u2019 (1997:65). This has particular relevance for the emergence of political \nidentities (Werbner 1997) and the resultant interplay on educational sites. For \nexample, in the aftermath of 9\/11, the constructions of Muslim identity - in-group and \nout-group - raised poignant issues of the safety\/security of Muslim students, \nimpacting not only on their performance and achievement but also on their accessing \neducation, posing questions of inclusion and equity. \n \nConstruction of identities is a political issue (Arendt 1959), dominated by multiple \nconsiderations and politics of representation. For the purposes of this paper, identity \nformulation is discussed at two broad levels: \n   \nOut-group constructions; and  \nIn-group constructions. \n \nOut-Group Constructions  \nOut-group constructions impact on self-perceptions, and affect partaking and \nperformance in the wider context. Some elements influencing these constructions in \nthe case of minority ethnic groups can further be placed within two broad sets:  \nThe masses and the media; and \nThe state and administrative machinery, including public services departments.  \n \nThe Masses and the Media \n \n 7 \nLiterature and archives abounds with records of racist media constructions of Muslims \n\u2018in very derogatory and vilifying ways\u2019 (Vertovec 2002). These categorisations and \ndefinitions influence their participation in the mainstream activities in all fields of life \nincluding education. Hall argues that racism \u2018operates by constructing impassable \nsymbolic boundaries between racially constructed categories\u2019 (1992: 255) and attempts \nto naturalise and perpetuate them (Brah, 1992:143), leading to the formulation and \ndissemination of a discourse reflecting complex contestations. The media, in its own \ninterests and traditions, plays a strong role in spreading and perpetuating this atmosphere \nof mistrust and resentment among the masses (Ahmed 1992; Hall 1997; Said 1981). \nGeneralizations from individual examples in the media, or elsewhere, to wider \npopulations further lead to misunderstandings and ambiguities affecting teachers\/leaders\u2019 \nperceptions of students\u2019 needs and educational destinations (Bhatti 1999; Haw 1998; \nParker-Jenkins 1995). Stereotyping and misleading assumptions impact negatively on \nthese young learners\u2019 aspirations and motivation, already burdened by the demands of an \nintricate balancing act in a \u2018between cultures\u2019 context  (Anwar 1998). \n \nSince the Nottingham riots of 1953, in particular, the media has played an active role \nin constructing negative images of non-white ethnicities and \u2018during the 1960s [and \nonwards] white hostility towards coloured immigrants seems to have grown, and \ncertainly become much more open\u2019 (Banton 1972:172). They have been invented by \nthe media as deviants \u2018from the accepted cultural norms of the host society\u2019 (Hill \n1970: 115). In his study of Jewish community Simon Taylor argues that for most first \ngeneration immigrants the outside world tended to regard them with \u2018hostility and \nsuspicion\u2019 (1993:61) because of differences of religion, customs and cultures, and this \nholds true for Muslims as well. Across ambiguities and misconceptions, images are \nconstructed by media and masses, which highlight the differences and increase the \ndistances. These images convey messages of rejection and exclusion. As a reaction to \nit an equally strong tendency develops to gravitate towards a concept of \u2018community\u2019 \nperhaps as a sheer defence strategy, and\/or for the purposes of physical security. \n\u2018External\u2019 definitions formulated and disseminated by the media, and signalled by the \nmasses, play a strong role in smoothing over the \u2018internal differentiations\u2019 (Hall 1996; \nJeffery 1976), leading to struggle for empowerment through a reverse discourse \n(Foucault 1980). The \u2018media portrayals of Islam as barbaric, irrational, primitive and \nsexist\u2019 (Osler 2003) have contributed to the intensification of political identities that \n 8 \nare \u2018asserted with pride and are capable of political mobilization\u2019 (Modood 2005). \nThese perceptions become intense in the backdrop of historical\/political legacies such \nas the Muslims in Spain\/Jerusalem, the crusades, the Western Imperialism, the Al-\nQaeda factor, and the 9\/11 have all making their marks both on in-group and out-\ngroup identity formulations in the case of Muslims. Kabbani\u2019s comments in post-\nSatanic-Verses-situation is one example: \n \n\u2018We were caught between two tyrannies: Khomeini\u2019s impossible death \nsentence against a writer (fallible or foolish though he may have been) and the \nharsh \"liberal\" fatwa against our religious identity, with its blanket dismissal \nof us as alien, barbaric. Such was the polarisation, that even those who had \nhardly perceived of themselves as \"Muslim\" before, except in family ritual or \npersonal reference, were suddenly forced to stand up and be counted as \n\"warriors\" for subtlety in either side\u2019s position\u2019 (2002). \n \n \nThe state and administrative machinery  \n \nDiverse communities are imagined and created by the state and administration for the \npragmatic purposes of \u2018managing\u2019 them, appropriating terms for the convenience of \npolicy formation and resource allocation. Blandly, it is representation for the study of \n\u2018society\u2019, \u2018culture\u2019, \u2018people\u2019, \u2018community\u2019, but as a political performance it can be \nmisplaced essentialism (Werbner 1997:228), distorting the real thing (Said 1985:22). \nPolitical, social, economic and administrative implications are all involved in a \ncomplicated context where relations between ethnic groups and the state are played \nout, and which subsequently define the communities and their boundaries, working \ntowards what Bauman (1997) explains as \u2018order-building\u2019 - a legacy of modernity. He \ndefines the two strategies as: \n \nAnthropophagic: annihilating the strangers by devouring them and then \nmetabolically transforming them into a tissue indistinguishable from one\u2019s \nown - a \u2018strategy of assimilation \u2013 making the different similar; smothering \ncultural or linguistic distinctions; forbidding all traditions and loyalties except \nthose meant to encourage conformity to the new and all-embracing order; \n 9 \npromoting and enforcing one, and only one, measure of conformity\u2019 (Bauman \n1997:47).  \nAnthropoemic: \u2018vomiting the strangers, banishing them from the limits of the \norderly world and barring all communication with those inside \u2026 a strategy of \nexclusion\u2019 (Bauman 1997:47).  \n \nBauman\u2019s definitions show some interesting links to the approaches associated with \nmanaging ethnic minorities on educational sites, such as: \n \n Assimilation \n Integration \n Celebration  \nThe dominant approach or mix is often influenced by the intended aims in a particular \ncontext at a particular time, involving a host of economic and political choices. For \nexample, recent \u2018celebrating diversity\u2019 approach can be a genuine desire for inclusion \nand equity, or it can be a calculated effort towards tapping in unaccounted resources. \nMoreover, how even the best of approaches is viewed by those at the receiving end, \ncomplicates the debate: \nAssimilation is a two-way, well-tended street, not a rubbish-strewn cul-de-sac \nlike the one we were assigned. Even if we had desperately wanted to integrate \n- and a great many did - we could not have done it without a welcoming hand \nfrom our new compatriots. Such generous gestures were rarely forthcoming. \nInstead, there was stinginess and suspicion, at both local and government \nlevel. We were left to our sombre psychological or material ghettos, but not \nbefore being handed the bright flag of multiculturalism to wave obediently. \n(Kabbani 2002) \nDavid Blunkett\u2019s (2003) criticism of young British Muslims as \u2018feeling part of their \nfaith\u2019, and suggesting to speak English in their homes (2004), or Peter Hain\u2019s (2004) \nimplied suggestion that second and third generation British Muslims are still \nforeigners if they maintain their religious identity raise questions about integration \nand identity. Is it integration \u2018at the price of \u2026 becoming less Muslim\u2019? (Smith \n2002:14). Modood argues that: \n 10 \n \n\u2018Cultural racism is likely to be particularly aggressive against those minority \ncommunities that want to maintain - and not just defensively - some of the \nbasic elements of their culture or religion; if, far from denying their difference \n(beyond the colour of their skin), they want to assert this difference in public, \nand demand that they be respected just as they are\u2019. (1997:165) \n \nDiversity is often treated as \u2018otherness\u2019, adding to the \u2018moral panic\u2019 (Werbner 1997) \nand insecurities of the ethnic groups\n2\n, particularly those with distinctive identities. \nThis draws attention to \u2018group closure\u2019 mentioned by Giddens (1993), maintaining \nthat \u2018people coming from one culture frequently find it difficult to sympathise with \nideas or behaviour of those from a different culture\u2019 (1993:39). The resulting \natmosphere of mistrust and uncertainty, coupled with exclusion, leads to \u2018in-group \ncohesion\u2019 (Jost and Major 2004; Stangor 2004), or \u2018encapsulation\u2019 (Anwar 1979), and \nsubsequently develops and strengthens the sense of group belongingness around a \nconcept of community which can be at times politically useful and psychologically \nsatisfying. \n \nIn-group Constructions  \n \nInternal definition refers to the self-perception\/s of a group and individuals, to make \nthe members seen as they politically want to be seen. Identity construction is a highly \ncharged terrain of contending ideologies and interests, laying claims to the power of \n\u2018discourse formation and dissemination\u2019 (Foucault 1980). This self-definition has a \nvalue and a meaning as long as the concerned people respond to the constructed \nsymbol in relevant contexts. \n \nIn-group-identity-formulation is a dialectical relationship between social identity and \nsocial settings, evolving in interaction with \u2018that part of an individual\u2019s self-concept \nwhich derives from his (her) knowledge of \u2026 membership of a social group (or \ngroups) together with the value and emotional significance attached to that \nmembership\u2019 (Tajfel 1978: 63). Referring to his family\u2019s preference for identifying \nwith religion (Islam) as compared to country of origin and home language, Modood \n(1997: 158) lists the religious principals and values as the deciding factor. In some \n 11 \ncases it can be a survival strategy, in response to perceived threats to lives, properties, \nbusinesses, even cemeteries (Vertovec 2002), which strengthen the bond of \n\u2018belongingness\u2019 to others of similar background (Pollock & van Reken 1999:19).  \n \nDiscussing identity constructions of Muslims in Britain, Hopkins and Kahani-Hpkins \nagree that in-group identity is affected by a sense of group belonging, but they \nemphasise that it is a highly political discourse emerging from \u2018one\u2019s understanding \nof the boundaries and characteristics of one\u2019s community, the processes by which \nparticular forms and levels of categorisation capture the collective imagination\u2019 \n(2004:42). An interesting example of the politics and process of identity construction \nis the Hui community - one of the 55 identified minority nationalities in China - for \nwhom religion (Islam) is the only unifying category of identity, even though many \nmembers of the Hui nationality may not practice Islam (Chiang 2001).  \n \nThere is abundant research claiming that even when the Muslims may not be \npracticing faith in many matters, they tend to emphasise their religious identity \n(Ummah). This identification is no longer necessarily connected to personal \nparticipation in distinctive religious practices (Jacobson 1998). Modood (2004) \nexplains it as \u2018political opposition to racism\u2019, arguing that \u2018the assertion of [political!] \nidentity, the public challenge of externally imposed identities by campaigns \npromoting collective self-concepts\u2019 reflects \u2018an ethnic assertiveness, arising out of the \nfeelings of not being respected or of lacking access to public space, consisting of \ncounterposing \u2018positive\u2019 images against traditional or dominant stereotypes\u2019. The in-\ngroup identity develops in this oppositional stance to external forces. Gaertner\u2019s \n\u2018common in-group identity model\u2019 (Brown and Gaertner 2001) refers to inter-group \ninterdependence, common fate, and shared exclusion as contributing to inter-group \nidentity. For the young Muslim students it might signify all that and much more, as they \nstruggle to cope with \u2018racial frames of reference\u2019 (Donald and Rattansi 1992:1), made \nmore intense in the post 9\/11 sensibilities and now worsened in post 7\/7 England. \n \nAt the intersection of these cultural and political contestations an identity discourse is \ncreated \u2018that urges to take care of its own problems, and assumes the major burden of \nmanaging its own public affairs\u2019 (Gilroy 1992:49). Identity-construction becomes a \npolitical stance to contend assimilation and defend identity and interests - \u2018a new \n 12 \ncultural politics which engages rather than suppresses differences...a difference which \nis positional, conditional and conjectural\u2019 (Hall 1992:257). Most sociological analysis \nwould disagree that there is any community with fixed definitions and permanent \nboundaries, pointing to the differences that cut across solidarities. The issue is \ncategorization and the processes leading to it. Avtar Brah emphasises that various \nconstructions:  \n \n \u2018signal differing political strategies and outcomes. They mobilise different sets of \ncultural or political identities, and set limits to where the boundaries of a \n\u2018community\u2019 are established\u2019.  \n (Brah, 1992:131) \n \nIn the case of Muslims, the overarching identity, setting the boundary, is Ummah. \nJacobson confirms that the British Muslim youth\u2019s \u2018attachment to their religious \nidentity has not progressively weakened or diluted as a result of the fact that they are \nliving in non-Muslim society\u2019 (1998:126). Her analysis is that \u2018religious boundaries \nare, by comparison to ethnic boundaries, clear cut and pervasive in this case\u2019 \n(Jacobson, 1998:127), and any Muslim, even non-practicing, can claim to identify \nwith it. Gilroy analyses the processes involved in the formulation of a \u2018community\u2019 in \nthe context of a social movement. He suggests that \u2018a political language premised on \nnotions of community\u2019 provides a context for spontaneous orientation of \u2018demands\u2019 \nand argues that \u2018the social bond implied by the use of the term \u2018community\u2019 is created \nin the practice of collective resistance to the encroachments of reifications, \u2018racial\u2019 or \notherwise\u2019 (1987:234-5). Creating a religious identity can be another expression of \ncollective resistance.  \n \nIn spite of the fact that this super-ordinate Muslim identity is riddled with constructions, \nwhich are situated and subjective, and are liable to contending interpretations, it is all-\nembracing in essence. The four major strands of identity with which the British \nMuslim students of different \u2018ethnic\u2019 origins have to cope with are: \n \n Country of abode identity \n Country of origin identity \n 13 \n Racialised identity \n Religious identity \n \nThe religious identity provides a flexible discourse for accommodating the other \nidentities and at the same time denotes an agenda for resistance. It expresses the \nmember\u2019s commitment to the continuity and perpetuation of the group, working at the \nlevel where conflicts and oppositions do not emerge as active barriers. When the threat is \nto the group\u2019s \u2018values\u2019, group members join and mobilise forces, rising above their \ninternal conflicts and contradictions. Such politically constructed terms contribute to \n\u2018build those forms of solidarity and identification which make common struggle and \nresistance possible but without suppressing the real heterogeneity of interests and \nidentities (Hall 1992:255). Muslim Ummah is an example of this heterogeneity, and an \nunderstanding of these layers of identity surrounding the core identity of Ummah has \nsignificance for the education of diverse Muslim groups. \n \nManagement of students\u2019 identity\/ethnicity: a way forward \nThe current literature concerning immigrant Muslim students\u2019 education tends to \noffers a skewed critique or an apology. Comparative achievement\/under-achievement \nstatistics of students from different ethnic groups are often presented as given and \npredetermined by their ethnic identity, which in itself can have a negative impact on \nmotivation and performance. There is a serious need to explore the conceptual and \nideological contentions between the dominant discourse on educational sites and the \nreverse discourses (Focault 1977, 1980) and to appreciate the potential of ethnic \ndiversity as a \u2018source of new intellectual and moral energy\u2019 (Parekh 2004).  \n \nThe British government\u2019s recognition of this potential is reflected in its emphasis on \n\u2018widening participation\u2019 and the strategies to facilitate \u2018fair access\u2019 to HE to the \ndisadvantaged groups (White Paper 2003). In this regard, the significance of students\u2019 \nexperiences during compulsory schooling and the subsequent implications in \ndetermining relevant decisions to access HE cannot be ignored, which places a huge \nresponsibility on the leadership\/management of the schools, particularly those with \nmultiply diverse populations: \n \n 14 \n\u2018The tendency to locate the blame for underachievement in students and their \ncommunities overlooks the role of schools as institutions, and teachers and \nheadteachers as leaders, in processes that lead to poor student performance.\u2019 \n(Blair 2002:182) \n \nThe leadership approaches and responses to diversity can play a vital role in shaping \nthe learners\u2019 engagement with teaching\/learning, their performance\/acheivement and \nfuture aspirations. This adds a value dimension to leadership role highlighting \u2018the \nmoral and ethical imperatives that drive school leaders\u2019 (Riley et al 2004:2), pointing \nto the leadership values as contributive to \u2018success\u2019 (Begley and Johansson 2003; \nBennet and Anderson 2003; Day 2000; Gold et al 2003; Harris 2002; Harris et al \n2003; Hopkins 2001). Peter Ribbins\u2019 emphasis on the role of \u2018wisdom\u2019 and an \nunderstanding of values for the good leaders (2003:172) has great pertinence for \ncomplex contexts such as multi-ethnic schools. The notion of \u2018Leadership a Moral art\u2019 \n(Hodgkinson 1991; 1996; also Fullan 2003; Greenfield and Ribbins 1993; \nSergiovanni 1992) in the recent leadership literature recognizes this dimension by \narguing that leaders have to take value-positions. This requires an understanding and \nrecognition of the values of the diverse groups, addressing the issues around \u2018whose \nvalues\u2019 or \u2018what values\u2019. If values with morals and ethics are \u2018the very stuff of \nleadership\u2019 (Hodgkinson 1991:11), the issue of \u2018whose values\u2019 gains central \nsignificance, posing challenges to leadership and \u2018wisdom\u2019. Riley et al (2004:9) \nengage with the issue by discussing the extent to which the leader\u2019s values and \nbeliefs, the school\u2019s values and beliefs and the community\u2019s values and beliefs can be \nharmonized for effectiveness. This harmonization can take place in a context of \ndemocracy, equality and mutual respect, and the \u2018educational leaders need wisdom\u2019 \n(Sternberg 2002), knowledge and understanding to make informed decisions: \n \n\u201cIf moral leadership is to be exercised and pedagogy re-engineered with any \ndegree of success, then future leaders will need a firm set of values. No doubt \nmany will have their own list, but integrity, social justice, humanity, respect, \nloyalty and a sharp distinction between right and wrong, will all need to be \nincluded\u2019. (Bennet 2000:3) \n \n 15 \nThe culture and ethos of leadership \"differ in fundamental ways across nations\" (Fullan \n1992:viii). Understanding the factors linked with the learners\u2019 performance and \naddressing these is what the learners broadly expect from the school leaders. This \nexpectation is particularly high in the case of the Muslim students because of the \ndiscourses surrounding knowledge status and teacher\/leader status in Islam (Shah \n1999a). An appreciation of these concepts (Shah, forthcoming) and of the \nstudent\/teacher-leader relationship from an Islamic perspective can open spaces for \nengaging with the Muslim learners, and addressing related educational, behavioural \nand social issues. Categorising these notions as expressions of high power-distance \ncultures, reflects ignorance of the underpinning values and the concepts, such as adab \n(respect!) in Islamic philosophy and how these can be availed for enhancing the \nlearners\u2019 performance. An understanding of diverse values and perspectives can \ncontribute to taking a fairer value-position. \n \nAdab is a concept with many applications and shades of meaning. Rooke (1998) \nexplains its socio-ethical side as primary and 'active', where adab designates a wide \nrange of social and ethical virtues, like good manners, tact, grace, indulgence towards \nfriends, refined taste, courage, erudition and literary skill. Adab, thus, is education and \nupbringing, high moral principles and correct behaviour, scholarship and knowledge, \nall at once (Rooke 1998). One example of violation of adab is the Satanic Verses, a \nbook widely condemned by the Muslims because they perceived it as violating the \nvalue of adab; and it was more outrageous coming from an author brought up within \nIslamic traditions and claiming to be a Muslim. An understanding of these concepts \nand values can be a useful asset to leadership role. \nThe factors impacting on Muslim students\u2019 schooling can be broadly grouped as being \nexternal to school and internal to school, but it is hard to draw the boundaries. There \ncan be political, economic, social and other issues, related to the students\u2019 \nbackgrounds, affecting their schooling, but practically beyond the remit of the school \nleaders. On the other hand, issues as external to schools as Satanic Verses or 9\/11 or \n7\/7 can effectively set off an avalanche of occurrences requiring the leaders to provide \ninformed and sensitive leadership. An awareness of how identities relate to ethnicity \nand religion, and how these develop and change at individual, community, regional \n 16 \nand national levels can prepare the leaders to respond to the issues with enhanced \nunderstanding.  \nThe educational leaders need to move beyond the assumptions and stereotyping, to \nunderstand the extent of de-motivation the Muslim students make conscious efforts to \nstruggle against. Conflicting discourses are played out in the class-rooms, labs, \ncorridors, play-grounds, cafeterias, and out in the streets, and identities take shape in \nresponse to active forces or reactive elements as personal responses, peer-pressure, or \ngroup reactions take effect. It would be useful for the school leaders to look further \nbeyond the held assumptions of poor performance linked to \u2018ethnicity\u2019, into the issues \nlike: \n \n Personal\/group identity \n Media projections \n Stereotyping\/assumptions \n Job routes \n Role models \n Peer pressure \n Community perceptions\/stances \n \nThese and similar issues shape the wider learning environment. West and Pennell \n(2003) rightly draw attention to \u2018wider social inequities or divisions that contribute to \nunderperformance at system, school and individual level\u2019, but that does not absolve \nschools and those who work within them from the responsibility for student learning. \nIn fact the challenge to leadership is to take cognizance of multiple \u2018inequities or \ndivisions\u2019, and to manage these towards improving students\u2019 achievement. For \nexample, an \u2018FSM immigrant\u2019, or a target for \u2018Stop and Search\u2019 (MCB 2004) identity \ncannot be conducive to enhanced performance. Leading multiethnic schools is \npredicated upon understanding the needs of the students (Anwar 1998), and engaging \nwith them in the right perspective. It needs a genuine belief in equality to attempt \nthrough the thick fog of assumptions to gain an understanding of the reality. The \nracilised practices and even comments carelessly thrown around regarding, for \nexample, social\/familial structures and career destinations of Muslim students can be \nhighly de-motivating for the concerned learners: \n 17 \n \n Arranged marriages are forced marriages. \n Islam imposes segregation. \n Wearing Hijab is forced. \n Girls are married very young - are not allowed to pursue \nstudies\/careers. \n Boys are under-achievers and disruptive. \n Boys will become taxi-drivers. \n Boys will go into family business \u2013 shops\/takeaways. \n \nThis stereotyping leads to processes of legitimation and de-legitimation in social \nrelations, breeding resentment against the racist discourses, distancing the students \nfrom the educational space. Huge literature on similar assumptions, for example \nregarding performance of Afro-Caribbean boys (Benskin 1994; Mac an Ghaill 1994; \n1988; Macpherson 1999; Majors 2001; Sewell 1997) draws attention to the \npervasiveness of the issue. These assumptions further affect teachers\u2019 support and \nattitudes towards the students, adding to the learners\u2019 hardships.  A study asking the \nMuslim girls in a school to complete the story of an immigrant Muslim female \nstudent, to study their attitudes towards academic success and career destinations, \nrevealed strongly positive incline towards high academic achievement and careers, \nbut also highlighted how teachers\u2019 responses to their educational needs were \nconstrained by widely held assumptions of early-marriages\/no-careers for these \nMuslim girls (Haw 1998). All these assumptions, studies and debates raise questions: \n Is it a mismanagement of identities of the British-born and British-schooled \nMuslim youth turning them into underachievers, in spite of the high priority \naccorded to education in their religion? \n Is the British education system failing the Muslim community in some way? \n Is it Britain\u2019s \u2018education apartheid\u2019 (Kabbani 2002) and a failure of will and \nimagination on the part of those involved in developing leadership for multi-\nethnic institutions? \n \nImposed Inclusion! \n \n 18 \nThe initiatives and strategies adopted over the last few decades to achieve \ninclusion in educational institutions have lacked full cognizance of the ethnic \ncultures and their value systems. This has often resulted in confusion and tensions \nat the implementation stage, adversely affecting the outcomes of the plans \nconceived with the best of intentions. The need is to change the approach towards \ninclusion. Imposed inclusion defeats its rationale - it needs to be worked towards \nin collaboration with the intended partners and can be useful only when positioned \nwithin the framework of equality. A problem with the notion of equality is how to \naccommodate it with \u2018difference\u2019, thus making it problematic for inclusion. From \nan Islamic perspective the argument is not constructed as \u2018equal and different\u2019 or \n\u2018equal but different\u2019; it is \u2018different but equal\u2019, a celebration of difference as a \nlocation for equality (Shah 1999). When inclusion defies diversity and identity, it \nmay trigger off unanticipated reactions, including the learners\u2019 disappointment \nwith the educational leaders and institutions.  \n \nConcerns expressed by David Blunkett\u2019s (2003) or Peter Hain\u2019s (2004), and \nmentioned above, might have implications for educational achievements of Muslim \nstudents, but these need to be studied in context. Why are Muslim students not \nintegrating in the schools? Why does a high performing Omer Sheikh drop out of \nLondon School of Economics to end in a prison? Werbner argues that \u2018exclusion, \nsilencing, any act of discrimination is an act of violence\u2019, emphasising that \u2018violence \nbegets violence and violence need not be physical\u2019 (1997:228). It breeds defence and \ndefiance. The enhanced desire among Muslim youth to become more informed about \ntheir religious identity signifies their dissatisfaction with the racialised identity, and \nthe absence of relevant provisions within the education system to satisfy this need \npushes the students towards sources some of which may not be very responsible. \nThere is no doubt that the religious identity is subject to harsh political opposition, but \nit also provides a power discourse to operate in. To a young teen-ager\u2019s self-esteem, \nan association with a \u2018powerful\u2019 cosmic identity would be more appealing as \ncompared to a negative racialised identity. The need is to raise questions and to search \nfor answers.  \n \nImplications for Leadership \n 19 \nThe educational leaders need to create a culture of genuine mutual interest and \nrespect, and a belief of being valued among all ethnic groups to build an environment \nconducive to achievement. For policies and projects to be effective, a desire to share \nand ownership is important. Placing value and respect in individuals and groups can \nbe more effective to encourage maximum participation and sharing, than all the \nglossy terms and projects. Even a term like multiculturalism is increasingly being \nperceived as a buzzword, reinforcing division and marginalisation. Parekh hints at the \ndissatisfaction with the associated discourse when he highlights the need to separate \ndialogical multiculturalism \u2018from segregationist multiculturalism, which leads to \nghettoisation, and also from hegemonic multiculturalism, which assigns minorities a \nfixed space\u2019 (2004).  \n \nSchools are a part of the wider community and the world at large, and the impact of \nthe political on the educational cannot be underplayed. Today\u2019s context has moved \nmuch further from the early 1990s, when measures like language, dress, food, prayer-\nrooms, etc., were on top priority to facilitate schooling for the Muslim children \n(Parker-Jenkins 1995). Issue of needs now extends to demands for recognising faith \nas a category of difference and making greater provisions - or these learners would \n\u2018go to private schools or mosques\u2019 (Smith 2002:10) if the schools fail to recognise \ntheir needs. The role of mosques and imams in Britain (Lewis 1994) with reference to \nthe education of Muslim youth is another related issue, but again is beyond the scope \nof this paper. However, the point I would like to make here is that the vacuum left by \nmainstream education provides them a space for functioning, which can be an \nexploitation at times, affecting the students\u2019 education in the schools.  \n \nAnother important role of leadership is to prepare teachers to be sensitive to religious \nand religion-related cultural differences. Jacobson recognises three levels of religious \noriented actions that make Muslims distinctive \u2013 at the level of religious practice \n(daily prayers etc), routine behaviour (dietary issues), and social conduct (morality \ncode etc) (1998:128). A sensitive leadership and informed management at all levels \u2013 \nfrom class-room to the community - can respond effectively to this diversity, making \nschooling a positive experience for the students.   \n \n 20 \nThe need is for a strongly positive action than to simply follow \u2018laying down arms, \nsuspending border skirmishes waged to keep the stranger away, [and] taking apart the \nmini-Berlin Walls\u2019 (Bauman 1997:57). The new generation of British-born Muslims, \nin particular, sees itself as equal partners in national membership \u2013 not marginalised \nimmigrants. Self-identity, as Giddens argues, is \u2018the self as reflexively understood by \nthe person in terms of her or his biography (original italics)\u2019 (1993:53). \u2018We are, not \nwhat we are, but what we make of ourselves\u2019 (Giddens 1993:75). The issue is no \nlonger to which group these students have been born but the right to equality as \nBritish citizens with multiple identities. The resistance to the dominant educational \ndiscourse is not a rejection of education \u2013 this would not align with the Islamic \nphilosophy \u2013 but a challenge to the existing power relations, seeking not just \ntoleration for ethnic difference but \u2018expecting others to respect them and adapt public \nattitudes and arrangements so that the heritage they represent is encouraged rather \nthan contemptuously expected to whither away\u2019 (Modood et al 1997:358). It is time to \nconsider the thought provoking questions posed by Esposito (2002:viii): \n \n Can the majority of Muslims retain both their faith and their identities and \ndo so in a manner that enables them to also accept and function within the \nsecular, pluralistic traditions of Europe and America? \n Is Western pluralism a limited form of pluralism?  \n Can Muslims (as well as Hindus Sikhs, Buddhists, and others) come to be \naccepted \u2026 truly and fully as fellow citizens with equal religious and \npolitical rights? \n \nThe debates can contribute towards positive practices. It is only when individuals \nfrom all religious, ethnic and other orientations are acknowledged as equally valued, \n\u2018fellow citizens\u2019, that the issue of students\u2019 achievement in schools, or other \neducational institutions, can be considered in proper perspective. It would be too \nsimplistic to expect \u2018others\u2019 not to realise the difference between being manipulated \nfor reasons, or being the focus of genuine care as equal citizens - being a window \ndressing or valued partners (Rubin 2002).  \n \n 21 \nEducational leadership has a professional and a moral dimension (Fullan 2003; \nGreenfield and Ribbins 1993; Hodgkinson 1991) which makes leaders\u2019 task more \ncomplex and challenging. They need much more than professional competence to \nrespond to contextual demands. Admittedly, every school context is a unique context, \nbut a wider knowledge base can nevertheless enhance understanding.  In schools with \nMuslim students, the leadership would need: \n \n An understanding of Islamic concepts of knowledge and knowledge \nbearers, and the notion of adab with reference to learner\/teacher-leader \nrelationship. \n An appreciation of the predicament of being caught \u2018between cultures\u2019 \n(Anwar 1998), and of the dilemma of the TCK \u2013 third culture3 kid (Pollock \n& van Reken 1999). \n Knowing the community through close links, by moving beyond the \nschool walls, and developing community networks (Riley et al 2004). \n Developing values and inclusive attitudes\/practices (Harris 2003), with \nattention to culture appropriate behaviour\/values. \n Tolerance and understanding for cultural concepts like family values, \nhonour, relationships (Anwar 1994; Shah 1998). \n Suggesting career pathways to students, and providing support and \nguidance (Metcalf et al 1996; Modood et al 1999). \n Ethnic minority teachers \u2013 recruitment, retention, development, \nprogression (Abbas 2002; Osler 2003; Ranger 1988)). \n Providing role models (Carrington and Skelton 2003; Modood 1993). \n Valuing difference (Shah, forthcoming) . \n \nAdmittedly, in a highly diverse multiethnic society, the school leadership feels \ncompelled to attempt to cultivate commonalities for all practical purposes and for \nsocial cohesion, but an understanding leadership is essentially \u2018sensitive to ethnic \ndifference, and incorporates a respect for persons as individuals, and for the \ncollectivities, to which people have a sense of belonging\u2019 (Modood et al 1997:359). \nGetting to know students and communities, and soliciting comprehensive involvement \nand collaboration is important to make any progress towards the learners\u2019 educational \n 22 \nenhancement, developing from where they are to where they can be. Rubin \nemphasises \u2018building and managing relationships\u2019 (2002:67) in partnerships, and it \nhas equal significance for educating minority ethnic youth. A pride and confidence in \ntheir heritage contributes to the learners\u2019 enhanced performance, and it is the leaders\u2019 \ntask to facilitate that goal by respecting diversity, by enhancing the students\u2019 \nconfidence in identity and by strengthening the notion of equality in relationships. \n \n \n****** \n \nAcknowledgements: \nI thank the University of Leicester for the fast track study leave, which helped to \nrevise this paper.
