In particular, the possibility that novel Helicobacter organisms play a role in human UC has been debated\nbut not comprehensively investigated. The aim of this study was to develop a molecular approach to investigate the\npresence of Helicobacter organisms in adults with and without UC.\nMethodology\/Principal Findings: A dual molecular approach to detect Helicobacter was developed. Oligonucleotide\nprobes against the genus Helicobacter were designed and optimised alongside a validation of published H. pylori probes. A\ncomprehensive evaluation of Helicobacter genus and H. pylori PCR primers was also undertaken. The combined approach\nwas then assessed in a range of gastrointestinal samples prior to assessment of a UC cohort. Archival colonic samples were\navailable from 106 individuals for FISH analysis (57 with UC and 49 non-IBD controls). A further 118 individuals were\ncollected prospectively for dual FISH and PCR analysis (86 UC and 32 non-IBD controls). An additional 27 non-IBD controls\nwere available for PCR analysis. All Helicobacter PCR-positive samples were sequenced. The association between Helicobacter\nand each study group was statistically analysed using the Pearson Chi Squared 2 tailed test. Helicobacter genus PCR\npositivity was significantly higher in UC than controls (32 of 77 versus 11 of 59, p = 0.004). Sequence analysis indicated\nenterohepatic Helicobacter species prevalence was significantly higher in the UC group compared to the control group (30\nof 77 versus 2 of 59, p,0.0001). PCR and FISH results were concordant in 74 (67.9%) of subjects. The majority of discordant\nresults were attributable to a higher positivity rate with FISH than PCR.\nConclusions\/Significance: Helicobacter organisms warrant consideration as potential pathogenic entities in UC. Isolation of\nthese organisms from colonic tissue is needed to enable interrogation of pathogenicity against established criteria.\nCitation: Thomson JM, Hansen R, Berry SH, Hope ME, Murray GI, et al.

This variable\nphenotype remains a puzzle, as does our difficulty in achieving\nlong-term cure with current treatments. Recent developments in\ngenetics have greatly improved our understanding of the\ninflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn\u2019s disease and UC), resulting\nin a renewed interest in the interplay between host immunology\nand bacteria at the mucosal surface; however genetic elements\nappear to be more important in Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) than UC.\nThe possibility of infection as a trigger event for, or indeed as the\ncause of, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has long been debated\nwith various organisms being suggested as pathogens. None of\nthese organisms have been conclusively proven as causative agents.\nStudies examining the diversity of bacteria in IBD have shown\nincreased cell counts of bacteria and reduced bacterial diversity.\nChanges in bacterial populations to the detriment of the host have\nbeen termed \u2018\u2018dysbiosis\u2019\u2019 and this change is thought central to IBD\npathogenesis. IBD onset following infectious episodes is well\ndescribed and one possibility is that gastrointestinal infection may\nfacilitate dysbiosis and ultimately IBD. Whether acute self-limiting\ninfection is sufficient as a single entity, or whether chronic\ninfection with as yet unknown agents is required to drive the\nchronicity of disease is unknown. UC is a stronger candidate than\nCD for a purely infectious aetiology because of the weaker genetic\nassociation, continuity of disease distribution and the relative\nlimitation of disease to superficial tissue. It is likely however that a\ncombination of host (genetic) susceptibility, a trigger event (which\nmay be infectious) and the progression to dysbiosis are all likely\nrequired for the development of IBD.\nThe discovery that Helicobacter pylori was the causative agent\nunderpinning gastric and duodenal ulceration and ultimately\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e17184\ngastric cancer revolutionised our understanding of these conditions\nand resulted in a Nobel prize for Robin Warren and Barry\nMarshall. The tantalising possibility that a similar agent is\nresponsible for IBD warrants consideration and exploration [2].\nThe family Helicobacteraceae contains the genera Helicobacter and\nWolinella. The Helicobacter genus can be split into two groups,\ngastric Helicobacter, describing those that preferentially colonise the\nstomach, and enterohepatic Helicobacter, which preferentially\ncolonise the intestinal or hepatobilliary system (Table 1). Entero-\nhepatic Helicobacter organisms have been cultured from both\nCotton-top tamarin monkeys (Saguinus oedipus) and rhesus monkeys\n(Macaca mulatta) with colitic disease (Helicobacter sp. Flexispira taxon\n10, Helicobacter macacae and Helicobacter sp. Rhesus monkey 2), whilst\nHelicobacter hepaticus and Helicobacter bilis have been shown to be\ncapable of causing IBD-like disease in immunodeficient rodent\nmodels [3\u20135]. Thus animal models demonstrating that infection\nwith Helicobacter spp. on a background of host immunodeficiency\ncan lead to colitis, and that \u2018\u2018auto-immune\u2019\u2019 type reactions to\ncommensal bacteria can be initiated by such organisms, would\nsuggest the possibility of parallel mechanisms in humans resulting\nin IBD.\nVarious groups have examined human IBD for the presence of\nHelicobacter spp., from the negative studies of Bell and Grehan\n[6,7], through to studies by Bohr, Zhang and Laharie which have\nsuccessfully demonstrated PCR evidence of non-pylori Helicobacter\n(npH) in both IBD and controls [8\u201310]. The methodologies used,\nthe variable rates of positivity reported between groups, and the\nsmall study numbers included in some, mean discussions at\nHelicobacter species level have been limited. Unfortunately, no-one\nhas successfully cultured non-pylori Helicobacter organisms from IBD\ntissue (although 7 enterohepatic Helicobacter spp. have been\ncultured from the gastrointestinal tract of humans with diarrhoea\nor systemic disease [2]). The difficulties in isolating and culturing\nnon-pylori Helicobacter from human colonic tissue highlight the\nimportance of molecular approaches as viable alternatives to\nfacilitate the study of the role of Helicobacter spp. in extra-gastric\ndiseases. However, it is vital that these molecular methods are\nsuitably sensitive, specific and applicable to a diverse range of\nsamples. The purpose of the present study was to design a\ncombined molecular approach to identify Helicobacteraceae organ-\nisms within a variety of gastrointestinal sample types. Our specific\naim was to examine colonic tissue from IBD patients to assess the\nprevalence of Helicobacteraceae organisms against tissue from\ncontrols largely undergoing colorectal cancer screening.

All strains were used in fluorescent in-situ\nhybrisation (FISH) and PCR optimisation studies.\nInitial assessment used a universal 16S bacterial PCR described\npreviously [12]. To allow identification of the family Helicobacter-\naceae (genera Helicobacter and Wolinella), 8 Helicobacteraceae PCR\nprimer pairs were assessed. The nested PCR combination of C05\nand C97 [13] followed by a reverse complement of primer C98\n[13] and1067r [14] was selected as it yielded a final product of\nsuitable length (,400 bp) for sequence analysis. For H. pylori\nspecific PCR, numerous H. pylori specific primer sets targeting the\n16S rRNA gene were assessed with the most successful pairing\nbeing identified as 27f (59-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-39)\n[15] and HPY (59-CTGGAGAGACTAAGCCCTCC-39) [16].\nBoth PCRs utilised the following conditions: denaturation at 94uC\nfor 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94uC for 1 min, 66uC for\n1 min, 72uC for 2 min. Final extension 72uC for 10 min. To\ndetermine the sensitivity of the genus PCR, decreasing amounts of\nH. pylori and H. hepaticus-derived DNA were spiked into faecal\nsamples which were previously analysed by FISH and PCR and\nfound to be negative for Helicobacteraceae. Dilutions ranged from\n500 pg to 0.05 pg of Helicobacter DNA with the detection level of\n0.5 pg Helicobacter DNA (representing approximately 30 bacteria)\nconsistently being achieved.\nDevelopment of FISH Methodology. Five broad-specificity\nprobes were designed to target the small subunit rRNA of the\nfamily Helicobacteraceae (Table 2). The new probes were designed\nwith the Primrose software package [17], checked against the\nRibosomal Database Project (RDP) and EMBL databases, and\nwere named according to the nomenclature suggested by the\nOligonucleotide Probe Database (OPD) [18]. One of the designed\nHelicobacteraceae probe sequences S-G-Hel-1047-a-A-21 had been\npreviously described as a Helicobacter genus specific PCR primer\n[14] but to our knowledge it has not been used as a probe. Of note,\nin-silico analysis indicated that this probe detects several bacteria of\nthe genera Sulfurimonas (17 of 21), Sulfurovum (9 of 42) and Wolinella\n(4 of 5). The specificity of the 5 newly designed Helicobacteraceae\nprobes along with four previously published H. pylori specific\nprobes (Table 2) was tested by whole-cell in situ hybridization\nagainst a panel of 60 reference strains derived from the human and\nanimal gastrointestinal tract (see above) including a panel of 9\nHelicobacter type strains [19]. As a positive control for the presence\nof bacteria, the bacterium-specific probe S-D-Bact-0338-a-A-18\n(termed Eub338) was used [20]. Following assessment of the\nvarious Helicobacteraceae probes, it was identified that the\nHelicobacteraceae probe S-G-Hel-1047-a-A-21 and the H. pylori\nspecific probe Hp16S2 hybridized only to the respective target\norganisms but not to any of the other organisms tested. Both the\nEub338 and Hp16S2 hybridised at 50uC and could be co-\nhybridised using discriminating fluorescent labels (Rhodamine red\nand Oregon green 488 respectively). S-G-Hel-1047-a-A-21\nhybridised at 52uC.\nValidation of Molecular Methods (PCR\/FISH) for the\nDetection of Helicobacteraceae Organisms. In order to\ncalculate the sensitivity and specificity of the dual molecular\napproach 100 gastric samples were selected on the basis of H. pylori\nstatus (50 positive and 50 negative). H. pylori status had been\nconfirmed previously by CLO test and histology; however this was\nblinded to researchers until after molecular assessment. FISH was\nperformed on archival paraffin tissue sections and PCR was\nperformed on DNA extracted from fresh biopsies.\nBiopsy blocks were cut to a thickness of 4 mm using a Leica\nRM2125RT rotary microtome with sections cut per block, and\nmounted on ChemMate capillary gap slides, 75 mm, (DakoCyto-\nmation, Cambridgeshire, UK). Following microtome sectioning\nand mounting of tissue, slides were dried vertically at room\ntemperature and incubated overnight at 37uC to ensure that the\ntissue was adhered to the slide. Slides were then arranged by\npatient and block number and sections 1, 3 and 5 were used for\nassessing the presence of H. pylori coupled with the universal\nbacterial probe. Sections 2, 4 and 6 were used for assessing the\npresence of all Helicobacteraceae. Biopsy sections were deparaffinised\nTable 2.

For glass slides carrying\ndeparaffinised tissue sections, 50 ml of hybridisation buffer was\nadded and coverslips were used to minimise evaporation.\nHybridisation was performed for 16 hours for all tissue sections\nand Vectashield Hardmount (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough,\nUK) was used.\nDNA extraction of mucosal biopsies was performed using the\ncommercially available Qiagen QIAamp Mini kit (Qiagen\nCrawley UK) with the following amendments. Biopsy samples\nwere kept frozen until the addition of ATL buffer before allowing\nbiopsies to equilibrate to room temperature, an additional 10 ml of\nProteinase K was added for an initial lysis period of 18 hours to\nensure complete lysis of the biopsy material prior to DNA\nextraction. PCR was performed as described above with biopsy\nDNA initially subjected to universal bacterial PCR [12] to confirm\nthe suitability of the DNA for further analysis.\nOne hundred infectious diarrhoea samples were also collected\nfor inclusion in the validation cohort. Samples were obtained from\nthe Department of Medical Microbiology (Aberdeen Royal\nInfirmary, Aberdeen) and DNA was extracted using the Nucleon\nphytopure DNA extraction kit. PCR was performed as described\nabove with faecal DNA initially subjected to universal bacterial\nPCR [12] to confirm the suitability of the DNA for further\nanalysis.\nAssessment of Helicobacteraceae Prevalence in Human\nColonic Tissue Using the Combined Molecular Approach\nArchival colonic tissue specimens. Paraffin embedded\ncolonic specimens from a total of 106 patients were obtained\nfrom the Department of Pathology (Aberdeen Royal Infirmary).\nFifty-seven ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and forty-nine healthy\ncontrols (HC) were included. All UC patients were assessed during\nactive disease and analysis was performed on all available colonic\nsites that were biopsied at the time of colonoscopy. The HC\nsubjects comprised individuals who had undergone a colonoscopy\nin which colonic tissue was macroscopically normal, and\nsubsequently confirmed as microscopically normal by histology.\nThis cohort was examined exclusively by the FISH method\noutlined above. This sample cohort was not amenable to PCR\nmethodologies.\nFresh colonic biopsy specimens. A total of 145 individuals\nwere recruited for the prospective fresh biopsy study, 86 formed\nthe ulcerative colitis (UC) cohort and were analysed alongside a\ncohort of 59 healthy controls (HC). Of the UC cohort 9 individuals\nwere excluded, 3 could not undergo colonoscopy for clinical\nreasons and 6 had an alternative final diagnosis. The HC cohort\ncomprised two groups. The first group (N= 32) were recruited\nspecifically for this study and had biopsies collected for both FISH\nand PCR studies (as outlined above). The second group (N= 27)\nhad been recruited previously and all 27 had biopsies collected\nfrom normal colon whilst undergoing polypectomy.\nBiopsies were collected during colonoscopy using standard\nendoscopic forceps (Boston Scientific Nanterre Cedex France).\nThe colonic mucosa was rinsed with sterile water via the\ncolonoscope to remove residual faecal material. Biopsies were\nimmediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and then transferred to\na 280uC freezer until used for DNA analysis. Additional biopsies\nwere also sent for histopathology assessment and FISH analysis.\nBiopsies were only collected for PCR based studies and so FISH\nanalysis was not studied in this cohort. Therefore mucosal biopsies\nwere obtained from 136 individuals, 77 with a clinical and\nhistological diagnosis of UC (55 established disease \u2013 three had\nantibiotic therapy in the 6 months prior to study recruitment, 22\nde-novo) and 59 healthy controls. The entire UC group had biopsies\ncollected for both fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) and PCR\nstudies. Samples that generated positive PCR results with\nHelicobacteraceae or H. pylori PCR primers were sequenced to\nconfirm identity. Based on sequence analysis results, samples that\nwere suspected of containing multiple Helicobacter sequences were\ncloned [12] and 5 clones per sample were sent for sequence\nanalysis (400 bp).\nEthical approval for the archival specimen analysis and the\nbiopsy study was granted by North East of Scotland Research\nEthics Service and written informed consent was obtained from all\nsubjects in the biopsy study.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis with the Pearson Chi Squared 2 tailed test,\nwas performed using SPSS statistics software version 17.0.1\n(December 1 2008).\nResults\nValidation of Molecular Methods (PCR\/FISH) for the\nDetection of Helicobacteraceae Organisms\nFifty of the gastric biopsy samples demonstrated FISH positivity\nusing both Helicobacteraceae and H. pylori specific probes along with\nthe universal Eub338 probe. The same 50 samples tested positive by\nPCR for Helicobacteraceae, H. pylori specific and universal bacterial\nprimer sets with a subset of results (N=10) subjected to sequence\nanalysis which confirmed the presence of H. pylori (sequence\nidentities .99%). The molecular results were 100% concordant\nwith the findings of clinical investigation indicating that the\ncombined approach had a high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.\nThe combined molecular approach was then applied to 100\ninfectious diarrhoea samples. All infectious diarrhoea samples\nshowed positivity with the universal bacterial FISH probe\n(Eub338) and the universal bacterial PCR. One diarrhoea sample\nwas positive for Helicobacter by FISH and both Helicobacteraceae and\nH. pylori specific PCR with sequencing confirming the presence of\nH. pylori. As non-pylori Helicobacter organisms have been isolated\nfrom diarrheal samples previously, we performed a series of\nspiking experiments to confirm that the diarrheal samples were not\ninhibiting PCR amplification. Ten samples which were negative\nfor Helicobacteraceae by both FISH and PCR were spiked with H.\npylori DNA (500 pg to 0.5 pg) prior to PCR amplification. All\nspiked samples yielded positive PCR and subsequent sequencing\nresults (.99% sequence similarity, over 360 bp, to the spiked H.\npylori 16S rDNA gene sequence) confirming that if present these\norganisms would have been detected.\nHelicobacteraceae Prevalence in Human Colonic Tissue\nArchival study. The UC archival cohort (n = 57, 44% Male)\nhad a median age of 40 (range 15\u201382) at the time of colonoscopy\nand were classified as extensive (40%), left sided (37%) and\nproctitis (23%) according to the Montreal criteria [22]. A total of\n284 biopsies were analysed with 46% of subjects having biopsies\nfrom inflamed and un-involved mucosa available (E1 n= 8, E2\nn=9, E3 n= 9) and the remainder having biopsies only from\ninflamed mucosa. The HC archival cohort (n = 49, 35%Male) had\na median age of 42 (range 14\u201380) at the time of colonoscopy. A\ntotal of 127 biopsies were processed in triplicate to assess the\npresence of Helicobacteraceae from the available pathology blocks of\nthe right and left colon including rectum. Subjects were considered\nto be positive if appropriate fluorescent organisms were observed\nin at least 1 slide. All fluorescent in-situ hybridisations were assessed\nalongside H. pylori positive gastric biopsy reference slides and a\nselection of Helicobacter reference strains. All of the 106 subjects had\nEnterohepatic Helicobacter Strains in UC\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 February 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e17184\nbacteria detected with the universal bacterial probe. Of the 55\nsubjects positive for Helicobacteraceae, 29 were from the UC cohort\nand 26 were from the HC cohort. In both groups there was no\nstatistically significant correlation with gender or age of the\nsubjects and in the UC cohort the extent of disease did not\ncorrelate with the rate of positivity either as detailed in Table 3.\nInterestingly there was a statistically significant difference in the\npresence of Helicobacter pylori with 13 of the Helicobacteraceae positive\nsubjects from the HC cohort also having a positive result for\nHelicobacter pylori compared with only 3 of the UC cohort\n(p = 0.002). Assuming that these Helicobacter pylori positive results\nrepresent transported gastric Helicobacter pylori we consequently\nremoved these from the Helicobacteraceae positive results, thus\ncreating a new category of non-pylori Helicobacter positive\norganisms. By this approach there was also a statistically\nsignificant difference in the presence of non-pylori Helicobacter\norganisms between the UC and HC cohorts (p = 0.04). There was\nno correlation with age, gender or severity of disease as detailed in\nTable 3. Because of limitations of the archival FISH technique it\nwas not possible to ascertain if the H. pylori organisms were entirely\nresponsible for the genus positivity or if the H. pylori were\ncohabiting with other non-pylori Helicobacter. Indeed, it was also not\npossible to ascertain if more than one Helicobacteraceae species was\npresent within a sample. Attempts were made to extract microbial\nDNA from the archival tissue but these were unsuccessful and\ntherefore a prospectively collected cohort was established with\nsamples taken for PCR based analyses and FISH analysis.\nProspective study. The prospective UC cohort (n = 77, 46%\nMale) had a median age of 42 (range 16\u201384) at the time of index\ncolonoscopy and were classified as extensive (25%), left sided\n(62%), proctitis (13.0%). A total of 137 biopsy sites were analysed.\nTwenty one (27%) subjects had a single site analysed, all of which\nrepresented inflamed mucosa and 56 (73%) had more than one\nbiopsy site assessed, of which 42 both had inflamed and\nuninvolved mucosa. The prospective HC cohort (n = 59, 59%\nMale) had a median age of 63 (range 30\u201375) at the time of index\ncolonoscopy. There was a statistically significant median age\ndifference between the UC cohort and the control groups (Mann\nWhitney U test p,0.001). A single biopsy site (n = 59) was\nanalysed from each control subject. All 136 subjects (77 UC and\n59 controls) had colonic biopsies available for PCR analysis and all\nwere positive for universal bacterial PCR indicating the presence\nof bacterial DNA within all samples. Of the 136 subjects, 43 (32%)\nwere PCR positive for Helicobacteraceae and 3 (2%) were PCR\npositive for both Helicobacter pylori and Helicobacter genus (Table 4).\nSubsequent sequence analysis of the Helicobacteraceae PCR products\nconfirmed the presence of only Helicobacter pylori in these 3 samples.\nThus 40 subjects were PCR positive for Helicobacteraceae but not H.\npylori. Sequence analysis revealed a further 4 subjects (3 controls\nand 1 UC) with only Helicobacter pylori identified.\nIn the remaining 36 subjects sequence analysis identified the\npresence of a further 8 Helicobacter species and a Wollinella\nsuccinogenes with 6 subjects having more than one species identified\n(Table 5). Of these subjects, 3 had multiple Helicobacter species\npresent within the same biopsy sample and 3 had different\nHelicobacter species spread between the samples analysed (Table\nS1). Helicobacter pylori were not found to co-exist with any other\nHelicobacteraceae species. The species identified and the number of\nsamples they were identified in is detailed in Table S1.\nHelicobacteraceae PCR positivity was significantly higher in UC\nthan controls 32 of 77 (42%) versus 11 of 59 (19%), p = 0.004). By\nanalysing the sequences obtained and including only those\nHelicobacter species classified as \u2018\u2018enterohepatic,\u2019\u2019 the prevalence\nwas 29 of 77 (38%) in the UC group versus 2 of 59 (3%) in the\ncontrols (p,0.0001). There was also a negative association\nbetween the identification of gastric Helicobacter species in UC (2\nof 77) versus controls (9 of 59, p = 0.007) (Table 4). There was no\ncorrelation between the age, gender or extent of disease.\nThe effect of bowel preparation on Helicobacteraceae PCR\npositivity was also considered. Of the 77 UC subjects, 32 had\nfull bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy along with all 59\ncontrol subjects. Helicobacteraceae PCR positivity in subjects with\nbowel preparation was significantly higher in UC than controls [20\nof 32 (63%) versus 11 of 59 (19%), (Pearson Chi squared test\np,0.0001)]. There was also a significant difference in Helicobacter-\naceae PCR positivity within the UC cohort based on bowel\npreparation 20 of 32 (63% full bowel preparation), 1 of 5 (20%\nphosphate enema preparation) vs 11 of 40 (28% no bowel\npreparation), Pearson Chi squared test p = 0.007). There was also\nno statistically significant association with antibiotic usage.\nTable 3.

However spiking experiments on this cohort indicate that\norganisms would have been identified had they been present.\nThese findings suggest that Helicobacteraceae are not a prominent\ncausative agent in infectious diarrhoea in our setting although\nthey have been isolated from diarrhoeal samples by other\ninvestigators [23\u201333]. Part of the rationale behind our developing\na combined approach to identify Helicobacteraceae, rather than one\nbased solely on either PCR or FISH, was that the combination of\ntechniques allows visualisation of organisms in-situ and species-\nlevel identification from sequencing. PCR-only studies can be\ncriticised based on the possibility that contaminant environmental\nDNA could bias results. In the gastrointestinal tract for instance,\nDNA could be transited to the colon in the faecal stream from\nfoodstuffs. FISH addresses these concerns by allowing direct\nvisualisation and localisation of organisms to the colonic mucosa.\nFISH-only studies however are limited by the constraints of\ndesigning species-specific probes and therefore they lack species-\nlevel sensitivity at times. By utilising both approaches Helicobacter-\naceae species present could be visualised and also identified. Based\non the strength of these validation studies, we considered that this\ncombined methodology was suitable for investigating Helicobacter-\naceae prevalence in UC colonic biopsies. A combined FISH\/PCR\napproach has also been utilised to examine Helicobacteraceae\nprevalence in a small cohort of children with IBD (n= 12)\n(Crohn\u2019s disease n = 11), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; n = 5)\nand controls (n = 4) [9]. This small study identified a strikingly\nhigh prevalence in both IBD (11\/12) and IBS (5\/5) versus\ncontrols (1\/4). Through sequence analysis of DGGE bands\nseveral Helicobacteraceae were identified including Helicobacter\nganmani, Wolinella succinogenes, H. hepaticus and H. pylori. Two\nfurther bands were identified as Helicobacter although equal\nsequence similarity was attributed to multiple species.\nThe results of our study show that rates of Helicobacteraceae\npositivity are significantly higher in the colonic tissue of UC\npatients than in controls. When sequencing data is analysed and\nspecies identities attributed, in control patients, the species\nidentified are almost exclusively gastric (namely H. pylori and H.\nmustelae (99\u2013100% sequence similarity); comprising 9 of 11). This\nfinding is in stark contrast to the Helicobacter sequences from the\nUC cohort where 32 patients had Helicobacteraceae species\nidentified, although only 2 of these were attributed to H. pylori\nand curiously, H. mustelae was absent. Our study was not designed\nto obtain gastric Helicobacter species. As such it was not possible to\nconfirm or refute the notion that Helicobacter species detected in the\ncolon are truly colonising the mucus or merely transiting from the\nstomach. For the former, Helicobacter grown from both sites\n(stomach and colon) would be necessary in order to undertake a\ndetailed strain comparison, which was not feasible within this\nstudy. As indicated in the results section there was also a\nstatistically significant difference in age between the UC and\ncontrol groups. The difference in age between the two groups is a\nresult of the control group predominantly being recruited from a\ncolorectal cancer screening programme whose lower age limit is 50\nyears.\nInterestingly, bowel preparation appeared to increase the\ndetection of Helicobacter species. It might be anticipated that the\nwash-out effect of bowel preparation might reduce the positivity.\nTable 6.

This was due to it being a clinical decision whether\nsubjects received bowel preparation or not. As no bowel\npreparation was given when there was the clinical impression of\nsevere disease. This suggests that Helicobacteraceae positivity is\nassociated with less severe disease. However no association\nbetween Helicobacteraceae positivity and the Montreal classification\nof disease extent and severity was observed.\nSix of the UC patients appear to have multiple Helicobacter\nspecies present within their colonic tissue. Two of the six had\ndifferent Helicobacter sequences identified from the same biopsy\nwhereas the other four had single Helicobacter species identified\nfrom biopsies taken from different regions of the colon. Mixed\nspecies were not identified in the control cohort although it should\nbe acknowledged that only single colonic sites were investigated by\nbiopsy. Nevertheless our findings suggest that more than one\nenterohepatic Helicobacter species can be present in the same\nhuman host although this does not appear to be the case for gastric\nspecies.\nIt should be noted that allocation of species should not rely\nsolely on 16S rRNA sequencing as comparison of these\nsequences can be misleading and does not always provide\nconclusive evidence for species level identification. Helicobacter\nspecies identity cannot be firmly established by 16S sequencing\nand the 400 bp product of the nested PCR further compounded\nthis by only allowing sequencing over this short segment.\nHowever there is confidence that the sequence belonged to the\ngenus Helicobacter based on the sequenced product. For example,\nalthough our nested PCR technique amplified a hyper-variable\nregion of the 16S rRNA Helicobacter genome which equated to\nan estimated average evolutionary diversity of 14 base pairs\nwithin the 9 species identified [34], it is not possible to be\ncertain of the Helicobacter species without additional genotypic or\nphenotypic characterisation [35]. There is always the possibility\nthat mixed Helicobacter organisms were present that had identical\nsequences over the 400 bp 16S rDNA region analysed. It is\npossible that alternative identification approaches including\ndenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) could have\nbeen used to address this potential issue. Where sequence\nanalysis indicated that mixed species were present, the\nadditional cloning and sequencing approach was undertaken\nwhich demonstrated the presence of multiple Helicobacter\nsequences within a few samples.\nThe use of nested PCR is known to increase the sensitivity of the\nPCR test; however it is also known that without strict use of\nappropriate control strategies including sequencing of positive\nresults, it can lead to false positives. In the current study, all\npositive nested PCR findings were sequenced in order to eliminate\nthe query of false positives due to nested PCR. Extensive attempts\nwere made to isolate Helicobacter species from the prospective\ncohort, however this was not successful. Helicobacter species are\nnotoriously fastidious and although novel Helicobacter species have\nbeen isolated from human faeces, to date none have been isolated\nfrom colonic tissue. Examining both FISH and PCR analyses on a\nlarge number of samples (n = 109) revealed a correlation rate of\n,68%. In the majority of cases, discordant results showed that\nFISH was more likely to yield a positive result than PCR. This was\nnot seen in our gastric validation cohort. The most likely\nexplanation is that the number of H. pylori strains present in\ninfected gastric tissue is higher than the corresponding number of\nHelicobacter species in the colon. These results suggest that the\nFISH technique is more sensitive but lacks the specificity to\nidentify the Helicobacteraceae species. Regardless of these technical\nissues, both techniques demonstrate a statistically significant\ncorrelation between the presence of Helicobacteraceae species,\nparticularly the enterohepatic Helicobacter species and the UC\ncohort.\nThe PCR methodology that we developed used a nested PCR\napproach for Helicobacteraceae but a single PCR was used for H.\npylori. It is likely that a nested PCR for H. pylori would have been\nmore sensitive in the colonic samples and would have increased\nthe detection rate. This is a plausible explanation for at least 3 of\nthe four samples which were shown by sequence analysis of the\nHelicobacteraceae PCR product to contain H. pylori despite H. pylori\nPCR results being negative. Nevertheless, in order to identify every\nHelicobacter that was detected, we chose to sequence every positive\nPCR reaction including those that were H. pylori positive in order\nto determine whether multiple species were present.\nAttributing causation to putative pathogens has always been a\ndifficult endeavour with the gold standard remaining fulfilment of\nKoch\u2019s postulates [36]. In an era of molecular biology and an\nincreasing awareness of the \u2018\u2018unculturable\u2019\u2019 microbiota of the\nhuman colon however, these postulates are perhaps outdated.\nSwidsinski and colleagues recently proposed alternative postulates\nfor a modern era [37]:\nN There must be a clear link between a pathogen and a disease,\nN The pathogenic organism should be identified and charac-\nterised (by traditional culture and phenotyping or by \u2018\u2018reliable\u2019\u2019\nmodern methods such as PCR, DNA sequencing and FISH),\nN There should be positive evidence of the chain of infection (this\ncan be from individual transfections or from epidemiological\nobservation)\nN Knowledge of a specific pathogen should assist the develop-\nment of new diagnostic methods and treatment\nWe would add that host factors, in particular genetic or\nimmunological susceptibility should be considered, particularly in\nthe context of IBD. We believe that our data adds considerable\nweight to fulfilling Swidsinski\u2019s second postulate and that the first\nhas already been firmly established in animal models. Further\nwork is required to address the third postulate which would clearly\nbe aided by successful culture of these organisms from the colonic\ntissue of UC patients.\nFinally, the presence of H. mustelae in the colonic tissue of\ncontrols but not UC patients warrants further consideration. Since\nH. mustelae is a gastric organism (previously only identified in ferrets\n[38]), it would be interesting to see if this species is co-colonising\nthe human stomach and colon, the colon alone or simply being\ntransited to the colon from the stomach. H. mustelae has a similar\nmorphology to H. pylori and is also a urease positive organism so it\ncould easily be mistaken with current clinical testing (CLO test) for\nH. pylori in human gastric disease. It may be that H. mustelae\nrepresents a less pathogenic organism in the human host which\nnonetheless confers the IBD protective benefits of H. pylori [39]. In\nterms of the extra-gastric Helicobacters our findings clearly\ndemonstrate compelling molecular evidence for their presence in\nthe human colon. Their presence in the human host is not well\nestablished compared to animal models however; there is no\nreason to suggest that they do not reside in the human intestinal\ntract. Clearly these hypotheses require further exploration.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Bacterial Sequence Identification* of Helicobacter-\naceae positive samples.\n(DOC)\nEnterohepatic Helicobacter Strains in UC\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 February 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e17184\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Dr Sylvia Duncan (Rowett Institute for Nutrition and\nHealth, Aberdeen) for supplying many of the bacterial isolates used in this\nwork.
