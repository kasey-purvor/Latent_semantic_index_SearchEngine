They sought to ensure that children would be protected, that appropriate written \nlanguage would be used to communicate with children and that an appropriate person would give \nconsent for children to participate. \n \nImplications \nResearchers should be attentive to issues of potential vulnerability when preparing applications.  \nREC letters may be improved by giving clear and explicit reasons for their opinions.   \n \n \n \n \n \nAbstract word count: 131\n3 \n \nWhat do research ethics committees say about applications to conduct \nresearch involving children? \n \nThe potential for children to be involved in research is changing rapidly,1  not least because of \ngrowing dissatisfaction with the quality of the evidence-base for children\u2019s medicines, disquiet at \ncontinued prescribing of unlicensed,  \u201coff label\u201d, or unsuitable formulations, and changes in the \nregulatory and policy environment for drug development and testing of paediatric therapies. 2  \nHowever, distinctive ethical issues arise in conducting health-related research involving children. 3\n \n \nEthical review of studies involving children must be conducted by a Research Ethics Committee \n(REC).   When it first reviews an application, an NHS REC can issue one of three \u201copinions\u201d: \nfavourable, provisional, or unfavourable (Box 1). When reviewing applications, RECs are charged, \namong other things, with assessing the arrangements for consent to research.   These vary \ndepending on whether the study is a Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product (CTIMP), \nand thus is governed by the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004.4  The \nRegulations provide that parents or those with legal responsibility for children under 16 must give \nconsent for a \u201cminor\u201d taking part in a trial, and that such consent represents the child\u2019s \u201cpresumed \nwill\u201d.  National Research Ethics Service (NRES) guidance on research involving children specifies that \nfor trials, \u201cchildren should [\u2026] be asked for their assent, if appropriate\u201d. 5\n5\n  However, assent is not a \nlegally valid concept for purposes of the Regulations, and its use therefore has an ethical rather than \na legal basis. For non-CTIMPs, UK law is untested.  NRES guidance advocates the principle of Gillick \ncompetence,  though this was developed in the context of treatment rather than research.6\n \n  This \nallows children who are felt to be competent to consent for themselves (usually if they are aged 10 \nyears or older). \nLittle is known about the issues that concern RECs when reviewing applications to conduct research \ninvolving children.  We aimed to analyse decision letters written by RECs in response to their reviews \nof applications for paediatric studies. \n4 \n \n \nMETHODS \nWe analysed 80 randomly sampled letters (see Box 2) issued by NHS RECs in the UK to applicants \nfollowing the first meeting at which an application was considered.  Ethnographic content analysis \nwas applied7 based on a previously developed framework 8\n \n that was modified in response to the \nnew data in this project.  Data were assigned to analytic categories using explicit category \nspecifications, facilitated by QSR N6 software.  Statistical analysis was not appropriate given the \nsmall numbers in our sample, but it was possible to offer simple counts of findings in particular \ncategories. \nOur project was deemed by NRES not to require research ethics committee review as it was \nconsidered to be service evaluation.  Letters were fully anonymised before analysis.  \n  \nRESULTS \nThere were 2261 applications for ethical approval to conduct research involving children in our \nsampling frame that met our inclusion criteria.  The 80 randomly-sampled letters were about \napplications to conduct a variety of study types (Table 1), with most receiving a final favourable \nopinion (Table 2). \nEthical issues raised \nOf the 80 letters, 59 identified ethical troubles specifically related to child participants.  These 59 \nletters are the focus of the following analysis. Many (48, or 81% of the 59 letters) were concerned \nwith the potential vulnerability of child participants, and raised issues including: use of child-friendly \nlanguage; responsibility for consent; and the need for special protection of children. \n5 \n \nChild-friendly language \nIssues specific to written language for children were raised in 68% (40\/59) of the letters. In 16 letters \nthere were concerns about \u2018young\u2019 children, 17 raised concerns about \u2018older\u2019 children and 24 raised \nconcerns about children of any age.  Three letters recommended that researchers consult external \nguidelines when amending their information sheets. \nThe Committee felt that the Information sheet for Young Persons was generally too \ncomplicated for an 8-year old child and would like it revised using simpler language.  \n(Pid0025, non-CTIMP, provisional opinion then favourable) Responsibility for consent \nDiscussion about who should give consent was included in 24% (14\/59) of the letters.  Of these, four \nletters suggested that a child\u2019s wishes should override those of a parent or carer, and explicitly \nstated that children should not be enrolled into studies if they did not wish to take part, regardless \nof parental wishes.  Eight letters stated that children should sign their own consent form.  There was \nsome evidence of concern about what would happen if only one parent gave consent.  \n Children should be encouraged to sign a consent form and a suitable document should be \nproduced. (Pid0077, non-CTIMP, unfavourable opinion) \nFour letters made reference to children\u2019s assent being obtained.  \n[There] should be a consent form for parents and older children who are consenting in their \nown right, and for minor children below the age of consent (in addition to the parental \nconsent form), an assent form .  (Pid1316, CTIMP, provisional opinion then favourable) Protecting children \nSpecific concerns about children needing protection were raised in 31% (18\/59) of the letters.  As \nwell as \u2018child protection\u2019 issues (in seven letters), four letters prescribed that children should be \nexcluded from studies, five suggested that children should be protected from the burden of \n6 \n \nparticipation, three specified that an adult should be present during study procedures , and six \nqueried what would happen if distress was caused. \nThe study will be a good student project, but the design is more complicated than it needs to \nbe, particularly as the children may become distressed at being asked some of the questions. \n(Pid1703, non-CTIMP, provisional opinion then favourable) \nDISCUSSION \nWhen RECs raised issues specifically concerning children, as they did in nearly three-quarters (59\/80) \nof letters we analysed, they tended to focus on children\u2019s status as \u2018vulnerable\u2019.  They sought to \nensure that written language that was to be used to communicate with the child participants was \nappropriate, and expressed concerns about consenting procedures, and emphasised the need for \nchildren to be protected in research.  These findings suggest that applicants to conduct research \ninvolving children should be attentive to these issues: RECs will be looking for evidence that \napplicants are aware of the ethical issues raised by research with children, including evidence that \nthey have given explicit attention to how children\u2019s particular vulnerabilities will be sensitively \nhandled and that they have thought carefully about how to communicate with children. \n \nOur study design does not allow us to analyse the materials submitted to RECs.  It is thus difficult to \ncomment on how far the absence of comments on particular issues reflects RECs\u2019 perception that all \nwas well with the application, or how far it might reflect a lack of attention by RECs to these issues.   \n \nOur data suggest that there are a number of areas where REC advice may be in addition to or \ndifferent from what is required by law.  The concept of assent has not been tested in law.  The need \nfor, and effect of, children\u2019s signatures to indicate consent, or the suggestion the child\u2019s wishes \nshould take precedence over those of the parents, also has no authority in law.  Similarly, CTIMP \nRegulations require only the consent of one person with parental responsibility.  Thus, while RECs \n7 \n \nmay express concern about obtaining consent from only one parent, the law would find it \nunproblematic.  Of course, ethical practice may well impose requirements above and beyond those \ndemanded by law, but it might be helpful if RECs clearly indicated whether their advice is in addition \nto legal requirements, especially when RECs are drawing on their own authority to make ethical \ndecisions.9  RECs should, as far as possible, make the reasoning behind their advice clear and explicit, \nand refer to any published guidance on which they are drawing in coming to their conclusions.\n8 \n \n \nBox 1: Decisions a REC can make on first review of an application \nA \u2018favourable\u2019 opinion means that an application is approved without further revisions; these \nconstitute ~17% of decisions made by RECs at first consideration of an application. \n\u2018Provisional\u2019 opinions constitute ~66% of decisions at first review, and require applicants to make a \nresponse addressing issues raised in the letter before a final opinion can be issued. The final opinion \nmay be either favourable or unfavourable. \nAn \u2018unfavourable\u2019 opinion (~8% of all submissions) at first review amounts to a rejection. \n9 \n \n \nBox 2: Description of letters  \nData source: NRES Research Ethics Database \nTimeframe: 1st March 2004 (when the database began) to 22 December 2006 (when the data were \nprovided) \nSample size: 80 letters (chosen for pragmatic reasons) \nInclusion criteria: Letters relating to applications where the applicants had indicated (via a tick box \non the application form) that their project involved the recruitment of children under the age of 16; \nletters that communicated a provisional opinion or an unfavourable opinion at first review.  \nExclusion criteria: Letters communicating favourable opinions (as they contain no requests for \nchanges, and offering little opportunity for analysis); letters where the final outcome of the \napplication was unknown; letters in response to requests for protocol amendments and site-specific \nassessments.   \n \n \n \n10 \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Dorothy Msimanga for her contribution to the coding of the letters. \n \nCompeting interests \nNone. \n \nFunding \nThis project was funded by the National Research Ethics Service (NRES).  NRES had no involvement in \nthe study design, in the collection, analysis and interpretation of data, in the writing of this paper, or \nin the decision to submit the paper for publication. \n \n11 \n \n \nWhat is already known about this topic? \n1. There is now considerable momentum for increased research with children but there is \nsome variability in the guidance available on ethical issues in involving children in research, \nand this guidance sometimes differs from legal requirements. \n2. Every project involving children to be undertaken in the NHS must first be reviewed by a \nresearch ethics committee, but little is known about the child-specific issues that RECs raise \nin their reviews. \n \nWhat this study adds  \n1. RECs tended to focus their concerns on the children\u2019s status as \u2018vulnerable\u2019. \n2. Applicants might increase their chances of achieving a favourable opinion by being explicit \nabout how they will handle these vulnerabilities and RECs\u2019 letters should give clear and \nexplicit reasons for their opinions.  \n \n \n \n \nCopyright licence statement \nThe Corresponding Author has the right to grant on behalf of all authors and does grant on behalf of all authors, \nan exclusive licence (or non exclusive for government employees) on a worldwide basis to the BMJ Publishing \nGroup Ltd and its Licensees to permit this article (if accepted) to be published in Archives of Disease in \nChildhood editions and any other BMJPGL products to exploit all subsidiary rights, as set out in our licence \nhttp:\/\/group.bmj.com\/products\/journals\/instructions-for-authors\/licence-forms.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \nReferences \n                                                 \n1 Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry.
