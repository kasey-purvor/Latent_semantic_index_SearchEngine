It is unclear, however, whether 3 \nprolonged exposure of riparian soils to nitrogen (N) loading will affect the rate of 4 \ndenitrification and its end products. This research assesses the rate of denitrification and 5 \nnitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from riparian forest soils exposed to prolonged nutrient 6 \nrun-off from plant nurseries and compares these to similar forest soils not exposed to 7 \nnutrient run-off. Nursery run-off also contains high levels of phosphate (PO4). Since there 8 \nare conflicting reports on the impact of PO4 on the activity of denitrifying microbes, the 9 \nimpact of PO4 on such activity was also investigated. Bulk and intact soil cores were 10 \ncollected from N-exposed and non-exposed forests to determine denitrification and N2O 11 \nemission rates, whereas denitrification potential was determined using soil slurries. 12 \nCompared to the non-amended treatment, denitrification rate increased 2.7- and 3.4-fold 13 \nwhen soil cores collected from both N-exposed and non-exposed sites were amended 14 \nwith 30 and 60 \u03bcg NO3-N g\n-1\n soil, respectively. Net N2O emissions were 1.5 and 1.7 15 \ntimes higher from the N-exposed sites compared to the non-exposed sites at 30 and 60 \u03bcg 16 \nNO3-N g\n-1\n soil amendment rates, respectively. Similarly, denitrification potential 17 \nincreased 17 times in response to addition of 15 \u03bcg NO3-N g\n-1\n in soil slurries. The 18 \naddition of PO4 (5 \u03bcg PO4\u2013P g\n-1\n) to soil slurries and intact cores did not affect 19 \ndenitrification rates. These observations suggest that prolonged N loading did not affect 20 \nthe denitrification potential of the riparian forest soils; however, it did result in higher 21 \nN2O emissions compared to emission rates from non-exposed forests. 22 \n 23 \n24 \n 3 \nIntroduction 1 \nExtensive agricultural activities accompanied by the use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer 2 \nhave resulted in higher concentration of nitrate (NO3) in surface waters in the U.S. 3 \n(Vitousek et al. 1997; Mitsch et al. 2001; Turner  and Rabalais 2003). Among agricultural 4 \nactivities, ornamental plant nurseries use more fertilizer than is used to cultivate row 5 \ncrops in the U.S.  (Colangelo and Brand 2001). Both  NO3 and ammonium (NH4) are 6 \nhighly prone to leaching from soilless growing media in plant nurseries under intensive 7 \nirrigation regimes (Harris et al. 1997). Loss of mineral N from nurseries occurs 8 \nintermittently after irrigation or heavy rainfall (Harris et al. 1997; Colangelo and Brand 9 \n2001). The N-laden runoff often flows across the nursery to finally reach bodies of water, 10 \ncontributing to the increasing reactive N load of surface and groundwater resources of the 11 \ncountry (Galloway et al. 2004). Higher NO3 concentration in the rivers of the U.S. is a 12 \nmajor cause of eutrophication in coastal waters (Turner and Rabalais 1994; Day et al. 13 \n2003). 14 \nDenitrification, or reduction of NO3 to N2O and N2 gases, is one of the major 15 \nmicrobial processes in riparian forest soils (Hunter and Faulkner 2001). It occurs under 16 \nanaerobic conditions in which organic carbon is used as an energy source and\n \nNO3 as the 17 \nterminal electron acceptor by heterotrophic soil bacteria (Tiedje, 1982). Riparian forest 18 \nsoils have greater potential to denitrify NO3 than surrounding agricultural lands (Lindau 19 \net al. 1994; Delaune et al. 1996). Use and restoration of riparian forests as a nutrient 20 \nmanagement tool for removing NO3 from agricultural and urban runoff is highly 21 \nrecommended to protect and improve water quality in the U.S. (Mitsch et al. 2001; Day et 22 \nal. 2003).  23 \n 4 \n Although riparian soils denitrify  NO3 at higher rates due to saturated soil 1 \nconditions and greater quantities of microbially available carbon, NO3 content under 2 \nnormal conditions can be limiting (Lowrance et al. 1995). Thus, an external source of 3 \nNO3 is needed to maintain high denitrification rates (Ullah et al. 2005) in these soils. 4 \nSuch loading of runoff NO3 into N-limited riparian forests markedly enhances 5 \ndenitrification rates (DeLaune et al. 1996), but it is not clear whether chronic exposure to 6 \nhigher NO3 runoff has a positive or negative impact on denitrfier activity in soils 7 \n(Smolander et al. 1994; Hanson et al. 1994a; Ettema et al. 1999). Bowden et al. (2004), 8 \nCompton et al. (2004), and Wallenstein et al. (2006), observed significantly reduced 9 \nmicrobial biomass carbon and activity in N-enriched temperate forest soils compared to 10 \ncontrol plots. This suggests that prolonged exposure of natural ecosystems to N can 11 \ninfluence important microbial functions in soil. Discerning the effects of chronic NO3 12 \nloading on denitrifier activity in riparian forest soils is crucial to quantify the potential of 13 \nriparian buffers to remove NO3. As denitrification is extremely variable both temporally 14 \nand spatially (Groffman et al. 1991), it would be useful to investigate the effects of 15 \nepisodic higher NO3 loading, as occurs from plant nursery runoff after irrigation or 16 \nrainfall, on denitrification rates of riparian forest soils (Groffman, et al. 1991). Such 17 \ninformation would help to develop nutrient management strategies for agricultural runoff. 18 \nThe relative amounts of N2O and N2 gases produced during denitrification in soils 19 \n(Skiba et al. 1998) depends mainly on soil moisture, available carbon substrate, and NO3 20 \nconcentration (Breitenbeck et al. 1980; Linn and Doran 1984; Skiba et al. 1998). Higher 21 \nsoil moisture and available organic carbon substrate promote complete reduction of low 22 \nto moderate levels of NO3 to N2 gas, thus reducing the net amount of N2O produced 23 \n 5 \n(Linn and Doran 1984; Ullah et al. 2005). Higher levels of soil NO3, however, result in 1 \nhigher net N2O:N2 gas emission ratios, since reduction of NO3 compared to N2O is more 2 \nenergy efficient and is favored by denitrifiers (Breitenbeck et al. 1980; Ullah et al. 2005). 3 \nThus, denitrification in riparian forest soils exposed to prolonged NO3 runoff may result 4 \nin higher net N2O emissions (Fenn et al. 1998). N2O is a \u2018greenhouse gas\u2019 that can induce 5 \n310 times more global warming than CO2 on a mole-per-mole basis and thus can upset 6 \nthe credits gained from atmospheric CO2 sequestration in these ecosystems (IPCC 1996; 7 \nYu et al. 2004). Moreover, N2O is also a major contributor in depleting stratospheric 8 \nozone (IPCC 1996). Current efforts to sequester atmospheric CO2 into restored riparian 9 \nwetland soils may be jeopardized by increased N2O emissions from these same 10 \necosystems. There is an acute paucity of data on N2O emissions from riparian forests in 11 \nthe northeastern U.S. (Groffman et al. 2000a), particularly from those exposed to 12 \nprolonged NO3 loading. Lack of data on the dynamics of N2O emissions from riparian 13 \nforests has hampered efforts to accurately measure and model N2O emission factors from 14 \nriparian zones for nitrogen cycling budgeting on a landscape scale (Groffman et al. 15 \n2000a).  16 \nIn addition to NO3, agricultural runoff also carries phosphorus (P), which, as a 17 \npollutant, can affect water quality and other factors in aquatic ecosystems (Silvan et al. 18 \n2003; Sudareshwar et al. 2003). Since P is an integral part of the microbial biomass in 19 \nsoils, prolonged P loading into riparian forest soils may affect the activity of soil 20 \nmicrobes, including denitrifiers (Silvan et al. 2003; Meyer et al. 2005). There are 21 \nconflicting reports on the effect of soil P level on the activity of denitrifiers. Sudareshwar 22 \net al. (2003) observed a decrease in denitrification rates when coastal wetland soils were 23 \n 6 \namended with P compared to soils with limited P; alternatively, Federer and Klemedtsson 1 \n(1988) and White et al. (2001) did not observe any effect of additional P on denitrifer 2 \nactivity in upland forest and Florida Everglade wetland soils, respectively. It would of 3 \ninterest to know if prolonged P loading of riparian forest soils impacts denitrifier activity.  4 \nIn this study, we compared the effect of additional NO3 on denitrification and net 5 \nN2O emission rates from riparian forest soils exposed to prolonged mineral N loading 6 \nfrom plant nurseries. In addition, the impact of phosphate amendments on denitrification 7 \nrates at selected sites was also evaluated. 8 \nMaterial and Methods 9 \nStudy sites 10 \nFour riparian forest sites were identified in southern New Jersey in the upper 11 \nCohansey River watershed (located between 75\n\u00ba\n 5\n'\n to 75\n \u00ba \n 20\n'\n W longitude and 39\n \u00ba\n 22\n'\n to 12 \n39\n \u00ba\n 35\n'\n N latitude). Two of the sites, Loew forest (LF) and Centerton forest (CF), were 13 \nexposed to nutrient runoff from surrounding plant nurseries for a period of 10 years. The 14 \nother two sites, Natural forest (NF) and Harmoney forest (HF), are located within 0.5 and 15 \n3 miles of the LF site and did not receive runoff from surrounding nurseries or landscapes 16 \nfor this period. As such, these sites are considered as non-exposed in terms of chronic 17 \nmineral N loading from the surrounding acreage. Atmospheric N deposition in New 18 \nJersey range from 3.6 to 7.8 kg N ha\n-1\n y\n-1\n (Dighton et al. 2004). This range of 19 \natmospheric N deposition in the region is considered elevated due to increased fossil fuel 20 \ncombustion and fertilizer production and use in the past 50 years (Fenn et al. 1998; 21 \nVenterea et al. 2003). This may have deleterious impacts on soil N cycling in riparian 22 \n 7 \nforest soils in southern New Jersey, in addition to the nursery run-off N entering into 1 \nsome of the riparian buffers. 2 \nRunoff reaching the N-exposed sites arose mainly from frequent over-head 3 \nsprinkler irrigation (at least twice-weekly from May to September) and rainfall from 150 4 \nacres of container grown and field nursery crops (LF) or 200 acres of container grown 5 \ncrops (CF). The runoff entered the LF site through a drainage PVC pipe and the CF site 6 \nthrough a drainage ditch.  Four replicate samples of runoff water were analyzed for NO3 7 \nconcentration at both locations in May and June, 2005 using the Flow Injection Analyzer 8 \nat the Rutgers University Soil Analysis laboratory. The average NO3 load of drainage 9 \nentering the LF site was 15.0 and 8.2 mg L-1 while that entering the CF site was 3.0 and 10 \n12.5 mg NO3 L-1, which in some cases exceeded the EPA water quality standard of 10 mg 11 \nL-1 (EPA 2004).  12 \nDue to lack of availability of analytical data on the extent and duration of run-off 13 \nnitrate entering these sites, an indirect approach was adopted.  Pools of N in soil and 14 \nfoliar litter were investigated for signs of prolonged nitrogen exposure and saturation. An 15 \nincrease in foliar nitrogen content, nitrification rates and NO3 leaching from forests in 16 \nresponse to chronic N loading are the established primary indicators of N saturation 17 \n(Aber et al. 1989; Magill et al. 2000).  18 \nThe soils in the four sites range in texture from silty clay loam to loamy sand. All 19 \nsupported mature forests, not used for commercial forestry, that were dominated by 20 \nmature stands of hardwood tree species of white oak (Quercus alba), northern red oak (Q. 21 \nrubra), red maple (A. ruburum), silver maple (A. saccharinum), willow oak (Q. phellos), 22 \npin oak (Q. palustris), and American holly (Ilex opaca). Other non-dominant tree species 23 \n 8 \nin these forests are green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), white ash (F. americana), yellow 1 \npopular (Liriodendron tulipifera), sweet gum (Liquidamber styraciflua), American elm 2 \n(Ulmus americana), and bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis). The LF site was infested 3 \nwith reeds (Phragmites australis), growing as a sub-canopy under the hardwood trees, 4 \nthat were concentrated along the nursery runoff flow path within the site. The CF site had 5 \nrelatively higher snag density and woody debris biomass than the other sites. Selected 6 \nphysico-chemical properties of the four sites are shown in Table 1. Consistently higher 7 \npotential nitrification rates, % foliar N and soil mineral N, and lower C:N ratios in the N-8 \nexposed sites compared to the non-exposed sites shows that the LF and CF sites were 9 \nexposed to prolonged mineral N loading (Table 1). 10 \nSoil sampling 11 \nFour replicate 1 m\n2\n sampling plots were randomly located at each site. Plots at the 12 \nLF and CF sites were located in forest areas inundated by the nursery runoff sheet flow. 13 \nTo avoid edge effects on soil characteristics, the randomly placed plots were situated in a 14 \nline at least 16 m down the boundary of the surrounding land uses and the forest. Unusual 15 \nfeatures such as hoof prints, small depressions, large surface debris, and other unusual 16 \nmicro-features were avoided during sampling.  17 \nSoil cores and bulk soil samples used for determination of denitrification, net N2O 18 \nemission rates, microbial biomass C and N and other relevant physico-chemical 19 \nproperties were collected on May 19, 20, 30, and June 18, 2005 from the LF, NF, HF, and 20 \nCF sites respectively. To avoid high initial soil NO3 concentration, cores from the LF and 21 \nCF sites were collected on dates when no nursery runoff was entering the sampling plots. 22 \nAt each sampling plot, 9 intact soil cores (6 cm dia. x 10 cm length) were collected in 23 \n 9 \nplastic liners (6 cm dia. x 15 cm length) using a slide hammer (AMS core sampler\u00ae, 1 \nAmerican Falls, Idaho). The collected cores were capped at both ends. An additional soil 2 \ncore (0-10 cm soil depth) was collected from each plot in bronze liners (6 cm dia. x 10 3 \ncm length) for determination of bulk density and moisture content. Finally, 4 soil cores 4 \n(0-10 cm soil depth) were collected and composited using a mud auger (4.4 cm dia.) for 5 \nanalysis of physico-chemical properties, a potential denitrification enzyme assay, and 6 \nconcentrations of nitrate and ammonium. The % water-filled pore space (WFPS) of all 7 \nthe cores collected from the LF, NF, CF and HF sites was 100, 100, 80 and 83%, 8 \nrespectively, at the time of sampling. The %WFPS of the soil samples were determined 9 \naccording to Ullah et al. (2005).  The intact cores and bulk soil samples were transferred 10 \nto the laboratory on ice and refrigerated until use.  11 \n Soil cores used for potential net N mineralization and nitrification rates were 12 \ncollected from all sampling plots during the last week of October, 2005.  Duplicate, intact 13 \nsoil cores (10 cm long) were obtained as described above and transferred to the 14 \nlaboratory on ice, where they were refrigerated until use. 15 \nPotential denitrification assay 16 \nPotential denitrification was determined using soil slurries according to Hunter 17 \nand Faulkner (2001).  Field moist soils (10 g dry-soil weight basis) were weighed into 18 \nfour 150 ml serum bottles from each bulk soil sample and were assigned randomly to one 19 \nof the four treatments \u2013 unamended control, 5 \u03bcg PO4 g\n-1\n soil, 15 \u03bcg NO3-N g\n-1\n soil, and 20 \n15 \u03bcg NO3-N +5 ug PO4 g\n-1\n soil in a factorial design.  For each treatment 4 replicates 21 \nwere used. After weighing soils in serum bottles, 10 ml of PO4 solution delivering 5 \u03bcg 22 \nPO4 g\n-1\n soil (as KH2PO4) was added to 4 bottles each labeled as PO4 only and PO4 + NO3. 23 \n 10 \nThe remaining 8 bottles received 10 ml of DI water. The bottles were closed with rubber 1 \nstoppers and shaken for 10 minutes to make slurry. After shaking, the rubber stoppers 2 \nwere removed and the bottles were wrapped in aluminum foil and allowed to equilibrate 3 \nfor 48 hours. It was assumed that 48 hours duration would be sufficient to expose 4 \nmicrobes in the slurry to the added PO4 for cellular incorporation, keeping in mind the 5 \nrapid turnover (in the order of hours) and assimilation of PO4 by the phosphate 6 \naccumulating microbes in the soil (Meyer et al. 2005). 7 \nAfter 48 hours, 10 ml of a NO3 solution (as KNO3) was administered to 4 bottles 8 \neach labeled as NO3 only and PO4 + NO3 treatments, while 10 ml DI water was added to 9 \nthe remaining 8 bottles. Bottles were then capped using serum septa and purged with O2-10 \nfree N2 gas for 25 minutes to induce anaerobic conditions. After purging, 10% of the 11 \nheadspace was replaced with acetylene (C2H2) gas that had been purified in concentrated 12 \nH2SO4 solution and DI water sequentially for the removal of acetone. After the addition 13 \nof C2H2, the bottles were wrapped in aluminum foil and shaken continuously for 6 hours 14 \non a reciprocating shaker at room temperature (appx. 22 \no\nC). Headspace gas samples (9 15 \nml) were collected from the bottles after 0 and 6 hours using a hypodermic needle 16 \nattached to a syringe. The gas samples were injected into 5 ml Becton Dickinson 17 \nVacutainers to maintain a high internal pressure to avoid any diffusion of outside air into 18 \nthe Vacutainers. The gas samples were analyzed within one week of collection on a 19 \nShimadzu GC-14A gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector. The 20 \nrate of N2O production, determined from the rate of accumulation of N2O in the 21 \nheadspaces of the bottles, was corrected for dissolved N2O in the slurry using the Bunsen 22 \nabsorption coefficient of 0.54 (Tiedje 1982). Denitrification potential was converted to an 23 \n 11 \narea basis (while accounting for differences in bulk density of the four sites) and is 1 \nreported as \u03bcg N m-2 h-1.  2 \nDenitrification and net N2O emission rates from soil cores 3 \nDenitrification and net N2O emission rates were determined on intact soil cores 4 \nbrought to room temperature and incubated for 24 hours. The purpose was to quantify the 5 \nresponse of these soils in terms of denitrification and net N2O emissions within the first 6 \n24 hours of NO3 loading. The 24 hours duration was chosen to simulate a hydrologic 7 \nretention time of 24 hours of the loaded NO3 into the riparian soils due to runoff.  The 9 8 \ncores collected from each sampling plot were randomly assigned to groups of three cores 9 \neach. One set was randomly selected for measuring net N2O flux while the remaining 2 10 \nsets were prepared for measuring denitrification rate with and without an added PO4 11 \namendment  The set to receive additional PO4 was amended with a 5 ml phosphorus 12 \nsolution to deliver 5 \u03bcg PO4 g\n-1\n soil, while the remaining cores received 5 ml DI water.  13 \nAll sets of cores were covered and equilibrated for 48 hours to give sufficient time for 14 \nmicrobes in the PO4 amended treatment to be exposed to the added PO4. After 48 hours, a 15 \n5 ml solution containing 0, 30, or 60 \u03bcg NO3-N g\n-1\n was administered to one core within 16 \neach set.. A syringe was used to evenly distribute the NO3 solution to the surface of the 17 \ncore. The WFPS of each core was brought to 100% by adding DI water to the cores 18 \nwhere WFPS was less than 100%. This was done to simulate a sudden increase in NO3 19 \nloading of the riparian soil under saturated soil conditions, delivered by nursery runoff 20 \nafter an irrigation or rainfall event. After amendment with NO3, purified C2H2 gas was 21 \ninjected into the two sets of cores selected for determination of denitrification rate. 22 \nApproximately 10 ml C2H2 gas was injected directly into the cores at the liner and soil 23 \n 12 \ncolumn interface in small aliquots using a syringe fitted with a 16 gauge 10-cm long 1 \nneedle. This was done to ensure a rapid and even diffusion of C2H2 gas into the soil pore 2 \nspace. The purpose of injection of C2H2 at the liner and soil column interface instead of 3 \nthe middle of the columns was to avoid disturbance to the soil column. After C2H2 4 \ninjection, the cores were sealed with airtight seals fitted with rubber septa for gas 5 \nsampling. The headspace in the closed column was replaced with an additional 5 ml C2H2 6 \ngas to achieve an approximate 10% C2H2 gas concentration in the column. The last set of  7 \ncores selected for net N2O emission were sealed with airtight caps without the addition of 8 \nC2H2 gas. Soil cores incubated with and without additional C2H2 gas were used to 9 \nestimate denitrification and net N2O emission rates. Gas samples, collected after 0 and 24 10 \nhours of incubation from the closed column headspace using a syringe, were analyzed on 11 \na gas chromatograph for concentration of N2O as described in the previous section. The 12 \nrates of denitrification and net N2O emissions determined are reported as \u00b5g N m\n-2\n h\n-1\n.  13 \nMicrobial biomass carbon and nitrogen 14 \nBulk soil samples collected from the four sites were used for the determination of 15 \nmicrobial biomass C according to Voroney et al. (1993). Four replicate (25 g field-moist 16 \nsoils) soil samples were fumigated in a desiccator for 24 hours to kill and lyse microbial 17 \ncells in the soil. The fumigated and a similar set of non fumigated soils (4 replicates each 18 \nfor each forest site) were extracted with 0.5 M K2SO4 solution for soluble organic carbon 19 \n(C) concentration at 1:8 soil to K2SO4 solution ratio . The extracts were filtered through 20 \nNo. 42 Whatman filter paper into 20 ml vials and analyzed using a Shimadzu TOC 21 \nanalyzer for determination of soluble organic C. Before analysis, samples were diluted by 22 \na factor of 4 to reduce the concentration of K2SO4 salts in the extracted samples because 23 \n 13 \nsalt passing through the TOC analyzer can clog the beaded column. The amount of 1 \nmicrobial biomass C was calculated as the difference of soluble organic C between 2 \nfumigated and unfumigated soils divided it by a correction factor (KEC = 0.40) to account 3 \nfor the efficiency of fumigation-extraction of the microbial C. Microbial biomass N was 4 \ndetermined using the chloroform fumigation-incubation technique according to Voroney 5 \nand Paul (1984). Four replicate (25g field-moist soils) samples from each forest site were 6 \nfumigated in a desiccator for 24 hours as described above. The fumigated samples were 7 \ninoculated with fresh soil for 10 days at room temperature ((~22 \n\u00ba\nC) to allow 8 \nmineralization of organic N in the sample including that in the lysed microbial cells. A 9 \nsimilar set of non fumigated samples (4 replicates for each forest site) were also 10 \nincubated with the fumigated samples. After the 10 days incubation, the samples were 11 \nextracted with 2M KCL for mineral N concentration determination. Microbial biomass N 12 \nwas calculated as the difference in mineral N in fumigated and non fumigated soils 13 \ndivided by a correction factor (KEN =0.30) to account for the efficiency of microbial N 14 \nextraction. Both the microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen are reported as \u00b5g C or N g\n-1\n 15 \ndry soil. 16 \nSelected physico-chemical properties of soils 17 \nGravimetric soil moisture content, bulk density, total porosity, water-filled pore 18 \nspace, soil particle size distribution, soil pH, mineral nitrogen, water-soluble organic 19 \ncarbon, and total soil C and N were determined on bulk soil samples according to Ullah 20 \net al. (2005). Total soil P content was determined using Mehlich 3 method of soil 21 \nextractable nutrients. 22 \n 23 \n 14 \nPotential net N mineralization and nitrification rates 1 \nOne of the duplicate soil cores from each sampling plot collected in October, 2 \n2005 was homogenized thoroughly by hand, and a 5 g sub-sample was extracted with 2 3 \nM KCL solution for the determination of initial mineral N concentration. The WFPS of 4 \nthe remaining soil cores was adjusted to 100% by adding DI water to the top of the cores. 5 \nThe cores were covered with a loose cap to allow for air exchange and to reduce the loss 6 \nof water vapor and were then placed in a box to incubate in the dark at 20 \n\u00ba\nC for 28 days 7 \n(Hart et al. 1994). These cores were incubated at 100% WFPS to simulate conditions 8 \nsimilar to the cores incubated for the determination of denitrification rates. Following the 9 \nincubation period, the cores were removed from the plastic liners and homogenized 10 \nthoroughly by hand. A 5 g sub-sample of the homogenized soil was extracted with 2 M 11 \nKCL solution for the determination of mineral N. Net nitrogen mineralization and 12 \nnitrification rates were calculated from the difference in the amount of initial and final 13 \nmineral N content (Hart et al. 1994). Net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates, 14 \nare reported as ng N g\n-1\n dry soil h\n-1\n.  15 \nFoliar Nitrogen 16 \nEight replicate samples of fresh leaf litter were collected from each 1 m\n2\n plots at 17 \nthe four forest sites on October 30, 2005. The samples were oven-dried at 65 \n\u00ba\nC for 5 18 \ndays. The dried samples were pulverized and analyzed on a LECO N analyzer using a 19 \nthermoconductivity detector for the determination of foliar N, which is reported as % N 20 \non dried mass basis (Table 1). 21 \n 22 \n 23 \n 15 \nStatistical Analysis 1 \nAll data were analyzed using SAS V-8.3 (SAS Inc. 2000). Within-site differences 2 \nin denitrification and net N2O emission rates of soils amended at 0, 30, and 60 \u00b5g NO3 g\n-1\n 3 \nsoil were done using analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the General Linear Model. 4 \nFisher\u2019s protected LSD was used for post hoc comparisons at \u03b1 = 0.05. Similarly, 5 \nANOVA was also used for between-site comparison of denitrification , net N2O emission 6 \nand N mineralization and nitrification rates. To elucidate any effect of PO4 amendment 7 \non denitrification rate, a two-sample T test was done using the pooled variance technique 8 \nat \u03b1 = 0.05.  A multiple regression model using the backward-selection option was used 9 \nto identify predictor variables that significantly affect denitrification and net N2O 10 \nemission rates from the selected sites. The data was analyzed to meet the normal 11 \ndistribution assumption of ANOVA and regression using the Proc Univariate procedure 12 \nat Shapiro-Wilk significance of p > 0.05. Pearson correlation coefficients between 13 \nvarious microbial and physio-chemical characteristics of the sites were determined using 14 \nSAS. 15 \nResults 16 \nPotential denitrification assay 17 \nThe potential denitrification rate of riparian soils either exposed or not exposed to 18 \nmineral N loading from nursery runoff increased significantly (p <0.05) when amended 19 \nwith 15\u00b5g NO3 g\n-1\n soil alone or in combination with PO4 (Figure 1). The addition of PO4 20 \nhad no effect on potential denitrification in soils from any of the sites. A significant 21 \nresponse of these soils to added NO3 in terms of increased denitrification depicts a 22 \n 16 \nlimitation of this process by available NO3 even after prolonged exposure of the LF and 1 \nCF sites to mineral N loading.  2 \nDenitrification and net N2O emission rates from soil cores 3 \nWhen intact soil cores were amended with 30 \u00b5g NO3 g\n-1\n soil, samples from all 4 \nthe sites responded with a significant increase in denitrification rate compared to non 5 \namended soils (Table 2), showing that denitrification in these sites is limited by NO3 in a 6 \nmanner similar to that found in Figure 1. The denitrification rates observed among sites 7 \namended with 30 \u00b5g NO3 g\n-1\n, however, did not significantly differ (p > 0.05). Although 8 \ndenitrification rate was further increased in soils amended with 60 \u00b5g NO3 g\n-1\n, this was 9 \nnot significant except in soil from the NF site.  The addition of 5 \u00b5g PO4 g\n-1\n soil made 10 \nlittle difference in denitrification rate (Table 3 11 \nThe addition of 30 \u00b5g NO3 g\n-1\n soil to soil cores collected from all riparian sites 12 \nincreased net N2O emissions by an average of 15-fold compared to the unamended 13 \ntreatment (Table 4). However, N2O emission rates averaged from soils collected from the 14 \nN-exposed sites (22.5 \u00b5g N m\n-2\n h\n-1\n) were 1.5 times those of the non-exposed sites (14.5 15 \n\u00b5g N m\n-2\n h\n-1\n) at 30 \u00b5g NO3 g\n-1\n amendment level. With 60 \u00b5g g\n-1 \nadditional NO3, net N2O 16 \nemissions increased significantly (p < 0.05) compared to the 30 \u00b5g NO3 g\n-1 \ntreatment in 17 \nsoils from the N-exposed sites. Moreover, N2O emission rates from the N exposed sites 18 \nwere on average 1.6 times higher (p < 0.05) than N2O emission rates from the non-19 \nexposed sites (Table 4).  20 \nSoluble organic carbon (SOC) was a key predictor variable of denitrification 21 \n(multiple linear regression) in soils from the four riparian forest sites when amended with 22 \n30 and 60 \u00b5g NO3 g\n-1 \nsoil, respectively (Figures 2 and 3). SOC accounted for 30% of the 23 \n 17 \nvariability in denitrification rate (denitrification in \u00b5g N m\n-2\n h\n-1 \n= 294 + 0.58 SOC in \u00b5g 1 \nC g\n-1\n soil) for the 30 \u00b5g NO3 g\n-1\n treatment, whereas this factor accounted for only 55% of 2 \nthe variability at the 60 \u00b5g NO3 g\n-1 \namendment level (denitrification in \u00b5g N m\n-2\n h\n-1\n= 199 3 \n+ 1.70 SOC in ug C g\n-1\n soil). SOC controls denitrification rates in these sites once the 4 \nprocess is not limited by NO3 availability. Unlike denitrification, no single strong 5 \npredictor variable of N2O flux from these forests was identified due to greater variability 6 \nof the flux rates and the complex interactions of the predictor variables in regulating the 7 \nflux- a condition encountered by other researchers (Smith et al. 1995; Groffman, et al. 8 \n2000b). The combination of various predictor variables accounted for 93%, 48% and 9 \n83% variability in net N2O emissions at zero, 30 and 60 \u00b5g NO3 g\n-1\n amendment levels, 10 \nrespectively. Among these variables, microbial biomass nitrogen, total soil nitrogen and 11 \nNH4 concentration correlated positively with net N2O emissions in the regression models. 12 \nThis suggests that an increases in different pools of soil nitrogen due to chronic N loading 13 \ncan increase N2O emissions during denitrification.  14 \nMicrobial biomass carbon and nitrogen 15 \nCompared to soils from sites exposed to nursery runoff, relatively higher soil C:N 16 \nratio and microbial biomass C in the soils from sites not exposed to nursery runoff (Table 17 \n1) indicates a higher pool of labile C available to denitrifiers, resulting in higher 18 \ndenitrification and lower net N2O emission rate. Microbial biomass carbon, SOC, and 19 \ntotal soil C correlated significantly with denitrification rate, whereas microbial biomass 20 \nN, total soil N, NH4, and C:N ratios correlated significantly with net N2O emission (Table 21 \n5). 22 \nPotential net N mineralization and nitrification rates 23 \n 18 \nPotential net nitrogen mineralization rates were not significantly different in soils 1 \ncollected from the four riparian forest sites (p > 0.05). Potential net nitrification rate, 2 \nhowever, differed significantly (p < 0.05) between N-exposed and non-exposed sites 3 \n(Table 1). The N-exposed sites had 8.4 times higher nitrification rates than those 4 \nobserved in the non-exposed sites. Total foliar nitrogen content was 1.2 times higher in 5 \nleaf litter collected from sample plots on the N-exposed sites than litter collected from 6 \nnon-exposed sites (Table 1). 7 \nDiscussion 8 \n Denitrification rate in soils collected from riparian forest sites either exposed or 9 \nnot exposed to mineral N loading, increased significantly in all the sites when amended 10 \nwith NO3. This observation clearly demonstrates that denitrification in soils from these 11 \nsites was limited by NO3 (Figure 1; Tables 2 and 3) and that prolonged mineral N loading 12 \ndid not affect the activity of denitrifying microbes in the soils collected from exposed 13 \nsites (LF and CF sites). Hanson et al. (1994a and 1994b) also observed higher 14 \ndenitrification rates in a N-enriched riparian forest in Rhode Island, and they concluded 15 \nthat higher denitrification capacity is a key process that moderates the effects of chronic 16 \nmineral N enrichment. Average lower soil NO3 (Table 1) concentration (2.9 \u00b5g N g\n-1\n 17 \nsoil) in the N-exposed sites in spite of chronic run-off input support the observation that 18 \nNO3 removal capacity of these sites is not exhausted by chronic N loading. In a study in 19 \nEurope, lower NO3 concentrations in groundwater beneath a riparian forest receiving 20 \nchronic N run-off was ascribed to higher denitrification rates (Hefting and de Klein 21 \n1998), which is in agreement with our results.  22 \n 19 \nThe observed rates of denitrification (Tables 2 and 3) in soils from all sites were 1 \nwithin the range of denitrification rates in riparian forest soils reported elsewhere in 2 \nliterature (Lowrance et al. 1995; Jordan et al. 1998; Hefting et al. 1998 and 2003).  3 \nHowever, caution needs to be exercised when extrapolating denitrification rates of the 4 \ncurrent study to bigger spatial and temporal scales, since these rates were determined 5 \nunder controlled laboratory conditions of soil NO3, temperature and moisture and thus 6 \nmay not reflect actual field conditions.  7 \nAs the addition of NO3 to soil cores increased denitrification, the rate limiting 8 \nfactor shifted from NO3 availability to available organic C substrate, especially at 60 \u00b5g 9 \nNO3 g\n-1\n soil treatment. For example, soil from the non-exposed NF site with significantly 10 \nhigher SOC and total soil C (Table 1) denitrified more NO3 than the rest of the sites at 60 11 \n\u00b5g NO3 g\n-1\n amendment level. This apparent control of denitrification rates by available C 12 \nsubstrate was found significant using the multiple regression and Pearson\u2019s correlation 13 \nanalyses (Figures 2 and 3; Table 5). Significant control of denitrification rates by 14 \navailable C substrate in riparian wetlands has been reported elsewhere in the literature 15 \n(Lindau, et al. 1994; Lowrance, et al. 1995; DeLaune et al. 1996; Hefting et al. 2003).  16 \nMicrobial biomass C also correlated significantly with denitrification rates (Table 17 \n5) supporting the argument that available C exerts a regulatory control on denitrification 18 \nrate, as biomass C is one of the sources of the labile C pools in soil. However, it is 19 \nnoteworthy that the microbial biomass carbon content (Table 1) of the N-exposed sites 20 \nwas significantly lower than those of the non-exposed sites (p < 0.05). Lower microbial 21 \nbiomass C  in the N-exposed sites is thought to be due to the negative effects of 22 \nprolonged N exposure. This finding is in agreement with those of Compton et al. (2004), 23 \n 20 \nBowden et al. (2004) and Wallenstein et al. (2006), who observed lower microbial 1 \nbiomass carbon and activity in N-enriched temperate forest soils in the northeastern U.S.  2 \nWallenstein et al. (2006) also reported a 59 and 52% reduction in microbial biomass C 3 \nand substrate-induced respiration, respectively, in soils of a N-saturated temperate forest 4 \ncompared to a non-saturated forest in New England. Ettema et al. (1999) observed similar 5 \neffects of N enrichment on biomass C and activity in riparian forest soils in Georgia. 6 \nThese authors feared that the denitrifying microbes in riparian forests may be threatened 7 \nby the cumulative negative effects of N saturation. Although we found significantly 8 \nlower soil microbial biomass C in the N-exposed sites, the current study did not observe 9 \nsignificant differences in denitrification rates among the N-exposed and non-exposed 10 \nsites, showing that riparian forests can sustain a high and persistent capacity to denitrify 11 \nNO3 even if exposed to prolonged mineral N loading (Hanson et al. 1994b). Given the 12 \nlimited temporal coverage of this experiment under optimum laboratory soil moisture and 13 \ntemperature regimes, further temporally intensive field denitrification assessment studies 14 \nof these sites is recommended to validate the current observations. 15 \nWe found no effect of PO4 addition on denitrifier activity (Figure 1; Tables 2 and 16 \n3), which is commensurate with the results of Federer and Klemedtsson (1988) and White 17 \nand Reddy (1999). However, our findings are in contrast to those of Sudareshwar et al. 18 \n(2003) who reported that P-enrichment of coastal wetland soils reduced denitrification 19 \npotential compared to similar non-enriched soils. None of these studies were conducted 20 \non riparian forest soils. Our data suggests that P input to riparian forests from agricultural 21 \nrun-off will not affect denitrifier activity.  22 \n 21 \nEven though denitrification rate in soils amended with additional NO3 (30 and 60 1 \n\u00b5g NO3 g\n-1\n) varied little among sites (Table 2), net N2O emission rates were higher from 2 \nsoils collected from the N-exposed sites (Table 4). It appears that these differences were a 3 \nresult of prolonged exposure of the N-exposed sites to nursery run-off. This result is 4 \nconsistent with the findings of Hefting et al (2003) who reported that N2O emissions from 5 \nriparian forests receiving chronic N loads were higher compared to emissions from 6 \nriparian grasslands, even though denitrification rates of the two ecosystems were similar. 7 \nHigher soil N pools, greater potential nitrification rates, and lower soil and microbial 8 \nbiomass C:N ratios (Table 1) resulting from prolonged N loading in the N-exposed soils 9 \nappeared to have reduced soil N2O reductase activity, which eventually led to higher N2O 10 \nemissions compared to emissions from the non-exposed sites. Moreover, prolonged N 11 \nexposure resulted in higher nitrification rates in the N-exposed sites (Magill et al. 2000) 12 \ncompared to the non-exposed sites. This observation is similar to those in other studies 13 \nthat evaluated N2O emissions from temperate forest soils after N fertilization in the 14 \nnortheastern U.S. (Bowden et al. 1991; Brumme and Beese 1992; Sitaula and Bakken, 15 \n1993; Barnard et al. 2005).  16 \nIn findings similar to ours, Hanson et al. (1994b) reported significantly higher 17 \nmicrobial biomass N in a N-enriched riparian forest soil compared to a non-enriched site 18 \n(Hanson et al. 1994b), suggesting that prolonged exposure of riparian forests to mineral 19 \nN is saturating different soil N pools. The soil N saturation phenomena, including 20 \nincreases in microbial biomass N and net nitrification rates, may be resulting in relatively 21 \nhigher N2O emissions from riparian forests when loaded with mineral N from agricultural 22 \nrun-off. Although a significant relationship (r = 0.50; p < 0.04) found between microbial 23 \n 22 \nbiomass N and N2O emissions from cores amended with 60 \u00b5g NO3-N g\n-1\n soil (Table 5), 1 \nthis does not likely represent a cause and effect relationship. Further studies are needed to 2 \ndefine the relationship between an increase in microbial biomass N and higher N2O 3 \nemissions in riparian forest soils.  4 \nIn this study, microbial biomass C was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the N-5 \nexposed sites (Table 1) compared to the non-exposed sites, which is in agreement with 6 \nthe findings of Ettema et al. (1999), Bowden et al. (2004), and Compton et al. (2004). 7 \nConcomitant decrease in biomass C with increasing biomass N and increased net 8 \nnitrification rates due to prolonged exposure of riparian forests to mineral N loading 9 \nstrongly suggests that episodic, high levels of NO3 input into N-saturated riparian forest 10 \nsoil leads to higher net N2O emissions.  11 \nSoil texture affects N2O flux from soils by influencing gas diffusion rates in the 12 \nsoil profile (Weitz et al. 2001). Compared to coarse-textured soils, fine-textured soils 13 \nlimit gas diffusion rates, thus enhancing the probability that N2O is reduced to N2 gas by 14 \nsoil denitrifying organisms (Weitz et al. 2001). Although the N-exposed sites (CF and 15 \nLF) were higher in clay (Table 1), net N2O emissions from these soils exceeded those of 16 \nsites not exposed to additional mineral N loading, supporting our finding that that 17 \nprolonged exposure of riparian forest soils to mineral N may have reduced N2O reductase 18 \nactivity. Soil water can also reduce N2O diffusion by approximately 4 orders of 19 \nmagnitude by filling and blocking up soil air pores. This increases the time for microbial 20 \nreduction of N2O to N2 gas before its emission into the air (Clough et al. 2005). Saturated 21 \nsoil conditions of the soil cores at the time of incubation may have obscured the effect of 22 \nsoil texture on N2O emissions from the four sites. We recommend further studies to 23 \n 23 \nelucidate the interactive effects of soil moisture and texture on N2O emission from soils 1 \nto better understand the fate of N2O in soils. 2 \nIn our study, N2O emission rates in treatments that did not receive additional NO3 3 \nwere within the range or lower than the N2O emission rates reported by other studies 4 \nfrom temperate forests in the northeastern U.S. (Bowden et al. 1990, 1991, 2000; Hafner 5 \nand Groffman 2005). However, when additional NO3 is loaded into riparian forests, 6 \nwhich are considered as \u2018hotspots\u2019 of denitrification and N2O production (Groffman et al. 7 \n2000a), N2O emission rate increases by a factor of at least 12 or more even under 8 \nsaturated soil conditions. The increase in N2O emissions due to NO3 loading needs to be 9 \nconsidered when calculating N2O emission factors for riparian forests by concerned 10 \nagencies (Groffman et al. 2000a) like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 11 \nand the U.S. Department of Energy-National Commission on Carbon Sequestration.  12 \nIn summary, the results of this research show that the denitrification potential of 13 \nriparian forest soils is not compromised after chronic exposure to mineral N run-off for 14 \n10 years. Moreover, addition of PO4 does not seem to affect the activity of denitrifying 15 \nmicrobes in these soils. Although riparian soils can substantially contribute to the 16 \nreduction of NO3 loading into water bodies in watersheds dominated by plant nurseries, 17 \nthese forests will emit relatively more N2O into the atmosphere compared to similar soils 18 \nnot exposed to chronic mineral N run-off. This should be accounted for at the landscape 19 \nscale within the wetlands potential carbon-sequestration context. We recommend that 20 \nriparian forests be considered as an integral component in developing strategies for NO3 21 \nremoval from nursery run-off in New Jersey and other similar eco-zones in the country. 22 \nAcknowledgments 23 \n 24 \nWe extend thanks to Ray Blew, Frank Loews, and Douglas Mahaffy for permitting us 1 \naccess to the riparian forest sites located within their nursery operation areas for soil and 2 \nwater samples collection.
