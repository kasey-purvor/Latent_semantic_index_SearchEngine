Observers were quick to explain this revolution in terms of \ndemocratic resistance to authoritarianism. This view is particularly problematic given that Kyrgyzstan was \namong the \u2018fast reformers\u2019 in the region and made its name as an \u2018island of democracy\u2019. Instead of \nassuming that problems started when the country digressed from the ideals of liberal democracy, this essay \nargues that democratic reform and market-led development generated both the space and motivations for \nrevolutionary action. Democratic reforms created the possibility of political dissent, while neoliberal \npolicies resulted in economic decline and social dislocations in which a temporary coalition between rural \npoor and dissenting political leaders was born. \n \nKey words: Kyrgyzstan, revolution, transition, postsocialism, neoliberalism \n \nIntroduction \nMarch 2005 saw the third revolution in the former Soviet Union within eighteen months. After \nthe Rose Revolution in Georgia and the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the Tulip Revolution \nrocked Kyrgyzstan. The world witnessed a swift and somewhat unexpected departure of President \nAkaev, who had ruled the country since 1990. On March 24, a group of up to 10,000 protestors \ngathered on the central square in Kyrgyzstan\u2019s capital Bishkek to demonstrate against flawed \nelection results and to demand resignation of Mr. Akaev. Not long after the demonstrations \nstarted \u2013 while organizers were still preoccupied with logistics and politicians held speeches \u2013 the \n 2 \ngathered crowd was attacked by a group of pro-government provocateurs. In the ensuing chaos \nseveral hundred demonstrators, all young males, immediately reacted. They managed to chase off \nthe provocateurs and continued in the direction of the \u2018White House\u2019, as the government\u2019s \nheadquarters was generally called. After skirmishes between riot police and demonstrators, the \npolice fled. Without further difficulties the demonstrators occupied the White House. One of the \nmain opposition leaders, Kurmanbek Bakiev, who arrived late at the site, reportedly exclaimed: \n\u201cWe did not expect this at all. It was not part of the plan\u201d (The Times of Central Asia, April 4, \n2005). The sudden breakdown of state structures set the stage for two chaotic days in the capital, \nin which property of former power holders was looted and aggression extended to other sources \nof wealth as well. However, by the second day the new leaders managed to restore order and life \nresumed more or less its normal pace. \n For a few days, Kyrgyzstan had made headlines in the world press. The images of \nviolence, burning police-stations, ravaged stores, and Rambo-like demonstrators captured the \nworld\u2019s imagination. However, the swiftness of the events in Bishkek did not leave time for the \ndrama to unfold as it did in Tbilisi or Kiev. One newly appointed government official said: \u201cOn \nMarch 24 we showed the world that there was no state: we overthrew it in 40 minutes\u201d (quoted in \nICG 2005: 9). Given the relative ease with which president Akaev was ousted, it is no surprise \nthat many people wondered if the events in Kyrgyzstan should be called a revolution at all.\n1\n Such \ndoubts were reinforced by continuities between the pre- and post-revolution regimes. In fact, the \nnew leadership was largely composed of officials who had fallen out of favor with the previous \nregime, but did not have a broad program for change. In the months after the revolution there \nwere few changes in policy, geopolitical orientation, or style of government.\n2\n However, whether \nthe power shifts in Kyrgyzstan should be characterized as a \u2018premature revolution\u2019 which caught \nthe new leaders by surprise, or as a \u2018stolen revolution\u2019 which only replaced some politicians, it is \nundeniable that popular discontent, massive uprising, and rebellion played a crucial role in the \nevents leading up to the final ousting of Akaev.\n3\n Indeed, the Kyrgyz revolution was as much of a \n 3 \npopular uprising as the previous revolutions in the former Soviet Union, albeit one whose \noutcome was already decided by the time action shifted from the provinces to the capital. \n Most observers have stuck to a fairly simple and straightforward scheme to explain the \nevents in Kyrgyzstan. In short, it is assumed that the causes were authoritarian rule, poverty, and \ncorruption; that the trigger was election fraud; and that the goal was (restoration of) democracy. \nThough these explanations are not completely unfounded, when examined closer they prove \nhighly problematic. They cannot explain the power dynamics involved, nor do they adequately \ncover the background against which this particular revolution should be seen. In fact, these \ncharacterizations are part of the conundrum of \u2018liberal democratic\u2019 teleology \u2013 the very thing that \nneeds to be critically analyzed to understand what happened. \n It is important to note that in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan \u2013 despite the rhetoric \u2013 it \nwas not the spirit of democracy poised against dictatorial regimes. Rather, these countries were \nrelatively open societies (certainly in comparison to their neighbors) in which \u2018democracy\u2019 was \ntoo important to be dismissed by those in power (cf. Silitski 2005). Rather than focusing on the \nimperfections of democratic reform in these countries, attention should be paid to the fact that \ndemocratization was accompanied by neoliberal reform agendas which resulted in staggering \npoverty and inequality. Similar to Fairbanks\u2019 assessment of Georgia, it was about people \u201cmired \nin the morass of a democratic \u2018transition\u2019 that [was] going nowhere\u201d (2004: 124). As such, the \nrevolutions point to the particular conjuncture of democratic ideals and failed transition, of open \nmarkets and asymmetric effects of market-driven development. In short, instead of assuming that \nthe Kyrgyz revolution was triggered by the appeal of democracy, I argue that in many respects it \nwas instilled by disillusion with democratization. \n This argument also bears out in the particularities of the Kyrgyz revolution as compared \nto the revolutions of preceding years. In Georgia and Ukraine a united opposition could claim to \nhave actually won elections \u2013 robbed off their victory by corrupt incumbents. Moreover, they \nwere able to do so because of the active involvement of a vibrant non-governmental sector and \n 4 \nbecause of extensive backing (openly or secretly) by Western countries. Although rigged \nelections also played a role in Kyrgyzstan, there was no unified opposition \u2013 anti-Akaev \npoliticians were internally divided and could not make a reasonable claim to have won elections. \nFurthermore, abstract ideals or geopolitical visions hardly played a role. Opposition politicians \ndid not promise new directions for Kyrgyzstan, but only better leadership. But perhaps the biggest \ndifference concerned the ways in which the revolutions were grounded in society. While the \nevents in Georgia and Ukraine largely unfolded in the respective capitals, the events in \nKyrgyzstan had their roots in the provinces. Moreover, the urban \u2018middle class\u2019 was largely \nabsent in the demonstrations, while students joined the protests only during the final days in \nBishkek. Even then, it was mostly young rural men who took the lead in overtaking the White \nHouse. \n In Kyrgyzstan, \u2018transition\u2019 produced \u2018revolution\u2019. In order to understand this process, I \nanalyze how Western projects of democratization and marketization traveled to Kyrgyzstan, why \nthey were embraced by the country\u2019s elite, and how they shaped the contemporary economic, \nsocial, and political situation. As such my argument resonates with the title of Kalb\u2019s recent \narticle \u201cFrom flows to violence\u201d (2005), which draws attention to the destabilizing effects of \nmarket-driven globalization. It is imperative to look not only at the impact of global capitalism on \nlocal contexts, but also to challenge the concepts that are so often used in describing the post-\nSoviet world. As Burawoy argued: \u201cAs socialism retreats into the past, the danger is that we will \nbecome ever more enthralled with a single model \u2013 an ideal typification of liberal capitalism \u2013 \nagainst which to compare reality, inevitably making of the post-Soviet world a black hole\u201d (1999: \n309). Instead of blindly accepting ideal typifications, then, it is more useful to discuss how \n\u2018actually existing democracy\u2019 worked in Kyrgyzstan, and to accept that democracy \u2013 especially \nwhen encased in neoliberal policies \u2013 is as problematic a form of political regime as any other. \n \nFrom transition to revolution \n 5 \nIn the 1990s, Kyrgyzstan was frequently praised for its speed in reforming its political and \neconomic structures, gaining status as \u2018the Switzerland of Central Asia\u2019 and as \u2018island of \ndemocracy\u2019. It is important to note that democracy and capitalism were not just rhetoric. The \nKyrgyz government implemented concrete policies that closely followed the advice and demands \nof international institutions such as the IMF and the Worldbank. The almost eager adoption of \nneoliberal economic reforms by the Akaev government in the early 1990s should be seen against \nthe background of the particular economic situation of the country. Lacking raw materials or easy \naccess to foreign markets, the government became convinced that development could only be \nachieved with foreign aid and investment. The plan that president Akaev and others designed (or \naccepted) was to attract investors by radically liberalizing the economic and political sphere. \nKyrgyzstan opted for a shock therapy-type of transition strategy. During the first five years of its \nindependence, Akaev\u2019s administration deregulated the economy, liberalized prices, started a \nmassive privatization program and introduced the \u201clegislative framework for stable functioning of \nthe newly liberalised economy\u201d (Abazov 1999: 243). In a few words, Kyrgyzstan was \u201cdoing \neverything right, according to Western standards\u201d (Connory 2000: 4).  \n The tragedy was, however, that although these policies were internationally applauded, \nattracted numerous economic advisors, and resulted in the highest per capita \u2018transition aid\u2019 in the \nregion, they did not attract major investors nor result in sustainable economic growth. As Spoor \n(1995) has rightfully noticed, market reform implied the dismantling of the socialist economy, but \nwas not accompanied by a factual restructuring of the economy. In the course of a few years the \nentire infrastructure deteriorated, while energy distribution became problematic. New laws were \nnot only poorly designed, but often unknown to those who had to implement them. International \nexperts had predicted \u2018transitional\u2019 difficulties, but it turned out that when the pace of change \nslowed down, production levels of industry and agriculture remained \u2018stable\u2019 on levels far below \nthose of the Soviet period.\n4\n These difficulties had profound effects on everyday life. Throughout \n 6 \nthe 1990s the percentage of people living below the poverty line increased, while unemployment \nand underemployment became rampant. \n Somewhat paradoxically, although the state became less able to fulfil the tasks it was \nexpected to deliver, political contacts became perhaps even more salient in economic activities. \nIndeed, the market turned out to be less a self-regulating system than a field of contention in \nwhich power relations favoured those well-placed in the administrative system and largely \nexcluded those in an unfavourable position. The focus on deregulation without sufficient \ninstitution building and state involvement, combined with a poorly operating judicial apparatus, \ncreated a perfect climate for those in power to take hold of former state property and to \nmonopolize parts of the economy. At the local level this translated into a reorganization of lines \nof dependency. While for many ordinary people the state [gosudarstvo] became little more than a \nnuisance, personal relations with those in power became ever more crucial for one\u2019s survival (see \nalso Kuehnast and Dudwick 2004). Whether it concerned rights to land-use, loans for farming, \nunemployment or disability allowances, virtually all economic assets were accessible only \nthrough political intermediaries. \n Although such dependency was often resented, the importance of personal networks in \npolitical and economic life meant that any hope for change was also projected on individuals. \nParliamentary deputies, who cultivated their regional affiliation, played an important role in this \nrespect. For ordinary citizens, especially in rural areas, there was a lot at stake in electing a \ndeputy, as they were considered key figures in directing substantial economic and political capital \nto particular regions, towns, and clans. For the candidates, many of whom were businessmen, it \nwas extremely profitable to be chosen as a parliamentary deputy. These positions created \npossibilities for political leverage on the economic scene and granted them political immunity \nwhich they used to protect their businesses. As will be shown below, these patterns of regional \npower consolidation were unwittingly intensified by an innovation in the parliamentary system. \n 7 \n But what does this mean for the ideology of transition that continued to dominate the \nrhetoric of the Kyrgyz government? Without aiming to provide an exhaustive analysis of \nchanging perceptions, it is worthwhile to indicate shifts in the meaning of involved terms. For \nsome time, the appeal of democracy and capitalism was precisely located in the fact that these \nwere not described in technical terms, but wrapped in images of an abundant and \u2018modern\u2019 future. \nWith the negative effects of economic and political reforms becoming ever more blatant, the \nterms democracy, capitalism, and market economy unavoidably lost part of their currency. \nDuring my first extended stay in Kyrgyzstan in 1995 numerous people complained about how \ndemocracy had ruined their lives. Nostalgic feelings for the \u2018good old days\u2019 of the Soviet Union \ndominated the popular mood. Nevertheless, at that time there was still hope that things would turn \nout for the better and that transition would only be a temporary phenomenon eventually resulting \nin a situation akin to the wealthy countries of the West. A recurring assumption, particularly \namong young people, was that capitalism had simply not reached them yet. This disconnection of \nprevailing realities from ideas about capitalism allowed for continued expectation that eventually \nthe transition would be completed.\n5\n \n Not altogether surprisingly, such hopes for a better future had faded when I spent two \nmore years in Kyrgyzstan, in 1998-99 and in 2003-04. At that time, few if any people had \nconfidence that the Akaev government would bring positive change. It did not seem, however, \nthat people were craving for \u2018more democracy\u2019. Indeed, Akaev had been the champion of \ndemocracy throughout the 1990s, yet democratization had not improved everyday life. Moreover, \nrepresentatives of the \u2018transition industry\u2019, both local and international NGOs were often seen as \ncatering to the interests of the rich and had little currency among the larger population (Boehm \n1999). Instead, many of my Kyrgyz acquaintances seemed more enticed by authoritarian and \ndecisive leaders. In the late 1990s, people in Southern Kyrgyzstan would often point at the \npresident Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan as a model of strong leadership which protected its \npopulation from the most disruptive effects of capitalism (this was before the excesses of \n 8 \nKarimov\u2019s regime became undeniably clear).6 By 2004 the most popular political figure for my \nacquaintances was Vladimir Putin, who was commended for his decisiveness, his actions against \ncorrupt magnates, and for having successfully instilled new pride in his nation. Thus, when \nAkaev was criticized it was usually not because of his authoritarian character, but rather the \nopposite, because he was too weak of a president. People often pointed out that although they saw \nAkaev as an inherently good person, his softness had allowed others to misuse their position and \nravage the state. In fact, such criticisms inadvertently reinforced the myth of Akaev as a modest \nscientist \u2013 a politician by default \u2013 who wanted nothing more than to guide the country in the \nright direction.  \n The myth of Akaev as a modest and good-willing leader was shattered in the run up to \nthe elections. Although few people seem to have believed allegations that Akaev was planning to \nchange the constitution in order to extend his presidency, it became blatantly clear that he was \nputting great effort to get a large majority of supporters in parliament (see also Mikosz 2005). \nMoreover, these pro-government candidates for parliament did not only include associates, but \nalso as many as seven of Akaev\u2019s direct relatives (including his son and daughter). Government \nsupport for these candidates all but proved that Akaev was consolidating influence of the \npresidential family on the national political scene. Moreover, these practices transpired while \nopposition newspapers published images of some of the family\u2019s spacious residences along with a \nlist of companies that allegedly belonged to, or were controlled by, the Akaev family. Outrage \nabout these practices played an important role in the unrest \u2013 numerous reports noted that \nprotesters were driven by a sense that Akaev and his family had \u2018gone too far\u2019.7 The modest \nscientist was unveiled as a shrewd businessman, one who vigorously tried to protect his illegally \nconstructed economic, and political, empire.  \n It may be clear that dissatisfaction with the state of affairs was adamant, and that people \nhad become increasingly disillusioned with the rhetoric of transition and democracy. However, \nthese structural conditions do not explain the occurrence, the shape, or the outcome of political \n 9 \nturmoil in Kyrgyzstan. Frustration itself does not explain revolutions. As Aya argues, \u201cthere is no \ndirect passage from anger to action, save through tautology\u201d (1979: 67). In fact, there was no \nreason to expect that people would massively support opposition leaders and that widespread \ndissatisfaction would translate into collective action. For example, only a week before Akaev\u2019s \ndeparture an observer wrote: \u201cWe are witnessing the weakness of the Kyrgyz opposition, which is \nregionalism. Pickets and demonstrations are held mainly in the south and only in constituencies \nwhere opposition were running\u201d.8 Ironically it was this regionalism, itself reinforced by neoliberal \nreforms, which set the stage for the revolution. An analysis of the political pattern and tactical \nlogic which unfolded in early 2005 may provide further insight in the specific ways in which \nanger was channelled. Moreover, this analysis will reveal why self-proclaimed promoters of \ndemocracy largely stood aside and why a temporary alliance emerged between the rural poor and \nsome well-known political figures. \n \nPolitical Turmoil \nEver since the Rose Revolution in Georgia, President Akaev had been highly aware of his \nvulnerable position. In a number of speeches he warned for the disruptive effects that similar \nevents would have in Kyrgyzstan and he tried to discredit the revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine \nby insisting that these were foreign-inspired and foreign-funded coups.\n9\n This view seems to have \nbeen his major anchor in attempting to avoid a similar scenario in Kyrgyzstan. Besides intensified \ncontrol of NGO activity, the government facilitated the creation of quasi-NGOs whose main \nfunction was to negate criticism by local and international non-governmental organizations.\n10\n \nLikewise, the number of corruption charges against opposition figures (a common way of dealing \nwith potentially threatening leaders) increased. It may be that the limited role NGOs played in the \ninitial stages of the Kyrgyz revolution indicates the effectiveness of Akaev\u2019s policies. More likely \nhowever is that even without repressive measures they would not have played a significant role, \nbecause they lacked credibility and popular support in the regions where the revolution started. In \n 10 \nhindsight, it seems that the government actions were in part misfired, and then backfired during \nthe parliamentary elections. \n At the outset of the revolution the opposition was divided and political parties were weak \nand fragmented. Moreover, reports from early 2005 suggest that opposition leaders were not \nplanning a revolution. Their stated concern was to retain a modest representation in parliament \nand to prepare for the more crucial presidential elections later in the year.\n11\n However, the \nregime\u2019s reinforced attempts to curtail opposition groups led to an unexpected convergence of \nlocal grievances and opposition goals. The crucial element in this process was that the elections \nimplemented the outcome of a referendum held two years earlier: the bicameral system was \nreplaced with a new unicameral parliament of seventy-five deputies, while party-list voting and \nproportional representation were replaced with a single member constituency voting system. \nThese changes meant that the total number of deputies was reduced by thirty and that political \nparties were left with no other constitutional right than to nominate candidates. The changes were \nprobably intended to limit the organizational strength of oppositional factions, but the reduced \nnumber of available seats left many regional elite figures running against each other and \nguaranteed that political struggles intensified at the local level. \n It should be clear that the elections were neither free nor fair, and that the outcomes were \nhighly manipulated. But then, this had been the case in previous elections as well. In fact, OSCE \nobservers indicated that the elections were more competitive than previous ones. With over four \nhundred contenders for seventy-five seats it was not only the \u2018opposition\u2019 which felt victimized, \nbut many independent and even pro-Akaev contenders as well. In this situation the usual deals \nbetween government and potential or actual candidates did not work.\n12\n Moreover, because of \ninternational pressure to adopt certain changes in the election process, manipulations partly \nshifted from invisible arrangements to conspicuous vote-rigging and other malpractices. In a \nsituation in which public interest in politics was tightly linked to everyday (local or regional) \nconcerns, this proved highly volatile. These \u2018competitive\u2019 elections then, proved the trigger by \n 11 \nwhich massive unrest was born. The resulting revolutionary situation can be divided in three \nphases: emergence of pockets of resistance; organization of discontent; violent confrontation and \ngovernment collapse.  \n Initially, the emergence of pockets of resistance resembled what had become a familiar \npattern on the Kyrgyz political scene since the late 1990s. Before the first election round on \nFebruary 27, protests focused on the exclusion and delisting of individual candidates. After the \nfirst round, demonstrations were held to try and reverse the election results. Many of these \nprotests were organized by (relatives of) unfortunate candidates. They often received wider local \nsupport because of the very concrete things that were (seen to be) at stake \u2013 for example new \nschools, water irrigation systems, or new roads. In principle these were all things that the national \ngovernment was supposed to take care off, but it was widely acknowledged that only a good \ndeputy would be able to channel the money in the right direction. At the time, there was no sign \nof a unified move against the regime. Rather, \u201cthose opposition members who won their elections \nand got elected told their supporters to stop their protests\u201d.13 The unrest thus appeared to be \ncommon commotion over election results. The government response was to ignore where \npossible and to give in where necessary, thereby aiming to prevent that a unified protest \nmovement would emerge. However, several peculiarities indicated that the unrest was different \nfrom previous protests. First, the protests were far more numerous than in previous elections. \nSecond, they occurred not only in the South where anti-Akaev sentiments were strongest, but also \nin the North where the regime had wider support. Third, several protests were led by candidates \nwho were considered pro-Akaev \u2013 as such indicating a growing fragmentation of the regime itself. \n The second and crucial phase started in the southern provincial capital Jalal-Abad \u2013 a \ntown of roughly one hundred thousand inhabitants \u2013 where events took a more serious character. \nOn March 4, over three hundred people led by Jusupbek Bakiev (brother of the later interim \npresident) who had lost his constituency, seized control over the provincial administration \nbuilding (akimiat). The move was well-prepared, judging from the fact that most demonstrators \n 12 \nwere dressed in pink, held banners, and were quick to demand resignation of Akaev. During the \nfollowing days, the number of protesters rose to several thousands. The visual images of these \nevents suggest that the vast majority of demonstrators were poor and from a rural background.\n14\n \nA relatively large number of them were women and elderly men. Residents of the town hastened \nto distinguish themselves from these \u2018rural masses\u2019. One observer quoted townspeople as saying \n\u201cthese are not part of us, they are not from the city, but the poor from the villages\u201d (Hoskins \n2005). Though some NGO activists tried to mobilize the \u2018core\u2019 population of the city as well, \nthey were largely unsuccessful. For example, the Kyrgyz student organization KelKel sent \nrepresentatives to mobilize students in Jalal-abad, but reported on March 10 that in spite of their \nefforts the students remained largely passive, apparently intimidated by university authorities.\n15\n \n Over the following week well-known opposition figures began to play a more active role \nin the continuing stand-off in Jalal-Abad. It remains guesswork as to why they took a more \nradical stance. It is possible that the initial success had emboldened them, but it is equally likely \nthat the devastating final results of the elections, which gave only six seats to opposition \ncandidates, provoked them to take the risk. One observer suggested that \u201cthe opposition realized \nits defeat and therefore decided to stake everything and put out radical demands\u201d.16 For example, \nit was believed that Kurmanbek Bakiev, who lost his constituency, would be arrested as soon as \nthe new parliament was inaugurated, that is, when he would loose his political immunity. From \nJalal-Abad the uprising spread to several other cities in the South, including Osh, the second-\nlargest city of Kyrgyzstan. It was by this time that a parallel structure started to appear. In both \ncities \u2018people\u2019s governors\u2019 were chosen, which directly challenged the regime\u2019s control over the \ncountry. A kurultai or general assembly was organized in Jalal-Abad, during which people voiced \ntheir concerns. Interestingly, these concerns seemed directed more at economic problems than at \nelectoral fraud. One report listed the issues raised at the kuraltai, which included \u201cwrong \nprivatization, not working industries, salary and pension problems, increase of corruption, no \norder in the country, ineffective use of investment and violations of rules during the elections\u201d.17 \n 13 \nBy March 18, three out of seven provincial government buildings were controlled by anti-Akaev \nforces, while another five district government buildings also fell in the hands of protesters. \nAlthough the majority of these were in South Kyrgyzstan, it included two in the North as well.\n18\n \n During the two weeks following the occupation of the akimiat in Jalal-Abad the \ngovernment appeared unable or unwilling to challenge the protesters. It chose simply to plod \nahead with the (second round of) elections, meanwhile trying to vilify the opposition. Throughout \nKyrgyzstan counter demonstrations were organized, intending to prove people\u2019s loyalty to the \nregime. In Jalal-Abad, one such demonstration consisted of teachers, doctors, nurses, and other \npeople on the state\u2019s payroll (gosbiudzhet). However, the participants appeared to be lukewarm \nabout their role. After having been filmed by the state television, and challenged by anti-Akaev \nprotestors, they quickly disbanded.\n19\n Newspaper articles and televised speeches further accused \nthe opposition of inciting civil war and linked them to religious radicalism and extremism \n(Vechernyi Bishkek 22 March 2005). The clumsiness of these efforts highlighted that the \ngovernment was loosing its grip, and was not able to effectively counter the course of events.  \n The final stage started on March 20, when government troops forcefully overtook the \nakimiats in Jalal-Abad and Osh. This happened while the local police \u201cstood on the street outside \nand did not arrest anyone\u201d.20 The action came too late. The violent attack provoked mass \nparticipation in the demonstrations, with up to ten thousand participants, after which protesters \nretook the government buildings in Jalal-Abad and Osh and occupied the airports to prevent \nfurther transfer of government forces. Moreover, this was also the time when new actors appeared \non the scene, like the rich businessman Erkinbaev, who assisted the protestors in Osh by sending \nin his well-trained militia. In fact, when protest finally took off in Bishkek everything had already \nbeen decided. On March 23 Akaev made a last attempt to counter the tide, by appointing the \n\u2018hardliner\u2019 Dushebaev as interior minister. It may have been Akaev\u2019s last misjudgment, because \nDushebaev proved unwilling to take the blame for a violent confrontation he would most likely \nhave lost. In the morning of March 24 he appeared among the crowd of protestors and indicated \n 14 \nthat he would not use lethal force against them. After having made this speech, he told a \njournalist that his loyalties were with the people, and moreover, was seen conversing with the \nleader of the opposition, Kurmanbek Bakiev.\n21\n It thus appears that by the time the demonstrations \nstarted on the central square in Bishkek, the regime had been deserted by most of its allies. Some \npeople in Kyrgyzstan complained that the revolution went too fast. University students, for \nexample, had hoped to turn the ousting of Akaev into a yellow revolution of lemons. However, \nthey were not given time to popularize their idea. Instead it became the Tulip Revolution, no \nmatter how meaningless the name in view of its chaotic immediate aftermath and its \ndisappointing results. Although, as all Kyrgyz (and Dutch) people know: tulips are quick to \nbloom, but they whither equally fast. \n \nRevolution without revelation \nThis essay argued that the intensification of poverty in the name of liberal democracy in \ncombination with the specifics of regionalism in Kyrgyzstan resulted in a temporary alliance \nbetween people at the lower end of society and politicians driving on regional authority. As to the \nultimate effects of the revolution there is less certainty. Eric Wolf wrote almost forty years ago, \n\u201cin the struggle of revolution, peasant anarchism and elite Marxism easily coincide. They only \npart company when the revolution is won and the task of reordering society begins in earnest\u201d \n(2001 [1967]: 240). Perhaps a distinctive ideological framework (not necessarily Marxism) would \nhave allowed for the alliance to last a little longer. But in absence of common goals, everyday \npolitics resumed and neither rhetoric nor practices set these apart from the Akaev era. Even the \ndisputed results of the parliamentary elections were accepted by the new government. And while \nthe looting of stores was quickly brought under control, several observers argued that the real \nlooting had only started, that is, the looting of the state\u2019s resources. Within two months after the \npower shift dissatisfaction became rampant, leading to new (but unsuccessful) demonstrations in \nwhich thousands of people participated.  \n 15 \n For the moment it is unclear if revolution is the method by which (halted) \ndemocratization is infused with new energy, or if it is the prelude to further instability, thereby \nintensifying the call for authoritarian leadership. In any case, the events have signaled both \nmessages to neighboring countries. While it inspired opposition groups in several post-Soviet \nrepublics to challenge their regimes, it also prompted autocrats to further curb dissenting views. \nHappenings across the border in Andijan, Uzbekistan, showed this paradox in bloody detail. Less \nthan two months after Akaev\u2019s removal, citizens of Andijan rose to demonstrate against the \nexcesses of the dictatorial regime. President Karimov, however, did not wait for protests to obtain \nwider clout. Instead the military ruthlessly crushed the demonstration. Over five hundred people \nwere killed, as a sad reminder of the (current) limits of revolution in the former Soviet world. \n If it is too early to make conclusive remarks about the outcome of the Kyrgyz revolution, \nit is ever more necessary to reflect on \u2018transition\u2019. As indicated above, the immediate post-Soviet \nperiod had seen much exuberance about the presumed transition of successor states. During the \n1990s this triumphant narrative broke down into national tales that diverged from the hoped-for \nstoryline. Still, for a relatively long time Kyrgyz leaders kept the dream alive and throughout the \n1990s the country continued to be seen as the shining example in a worrisome region. But, if \nfifteen years of \u2018transition to democracy\u2019 produced a \u2018revolution to democracy\u2019, what can we \nexpect to follow from this revolution? Perhaps a second transition? Sadly enough, the term has \nalready reappeared \u2013 in describing the aftermath of the revolution as \u201cthe transition begins\u201d \n(Mikosz 2005). Overall, Western reactions to the Tulip Revolution were highly reminiscent of the \nrhetoric employed fifteen years previously \u2013 political change was seen, once again, as a victory of \ndemocracy, as an indicator of the ultimate appeal and strength of liberal democracy. The official \nEU statement, for example, held that now \u201cKyrgyzstan has an opportunity to set a positive \nexample to the Central Asian region by holding free and fair elections and by promoting \ndemocratization, rule of law and human rights\u201d (The Times of Central Asia, June 4, 2005). \nSimilarly, and predictably, president Bush cited the Tulip Revolution as an example which \n 16 \nshowed that \u201cWe are seeing the rise of a new generation whose hearts burn for freedom \u2013 and \nthey will have it\u201d.22 Since local and Western politicians alike have pressing reasons to keep the \ndream alive, one can even conceive of an accelerated succession of virtual transitions to ever \n\u2018realer\u2019 forms of democracy, perhaps ever further removed from everyday realities. \n Instead of getting lost in the myriad of dreamlike images about a teleological trajectory \ninto the future (or of accepting transition as a permanent state of being), it may be worthwhile to \nsay that the first fifteen years of Kyrgyz independence represented \u2018actually existing democracy\u2019, \nand acknowledge that this was what capitalist reforms looked like in a particular post-Soviet \ncontext. After fifteen years of democracy talk and disruptive economic reforms, many ordinary \npeople had already made that conclusion. For them Akaev had become the face of democracy \u2013 \nfirst associated with hope, and then with disillusion. Put differently, insisting that the revolution \nmarks the beginning of a transition to \u2018real\u2019 democracy will, to put it mildly, not find much \ncurrency as long as the rhetoric is not accompanied by real and palpable changes in people\u2019s \neveryday lives. Still, comparisons with the immediate post-Soviet period can be useful. As \nGoldstone wrote: \u201cThe main problem facing the new postsocialist regimes was not spreading the \nrevolution but rather building new national institutions that could cope with the emergent private, \ncriminal, and bureaucratic entrepreneurs rushing to fill the vacuum of power\u201d (2001: 144). \nUnfortunately, that task still remains to be addressed, and the rhetoric of liberal democracy will \ndo little to solve the problems. \n In the meantime, Akaev has started to popularize his own version of the power shift in \nKyrgyzstan. A few weeks after his ouster of power, Akaev gave speeches in which he stressed \nthat democracy has a future in Central Asia, but that it should be reached through \u2018organic \ngrowth\u2019 rather than be exported from abroad.23 The irony is that Akaev was the post-Soviet \npresident who had accepted such exports most eagerly, and who was able to profit personally \nfrom the messy liberalizations of political and economic life. It would take a psychologist to \nspeculate whether Akaev really sees himself as a democrat, but his insistence on presenting \n 17 \nhimself as such makes me want to conclude with a reference to Gorbachev, another former \npresident who gave speeches about a revolution which ousted him from power. For many years, \nGorbachev continued to be a desired speaker in Europe and the US, perhaps because the collapse \nof the Soviet Union symbolized a victory of liberal democracy. But whereas Gorbachev was \nlauded for having opened up the Soviet Union, it is unlikely that Akaev will receive similar kinds \nof praise. Audiences in the West are more likely to interpret Akaev\u2019s self-portrayal as a belated \nattempt at (self) deception. Still, Akaev has his own audience \u2013 no longer among the defenders \nand promoters of liberal democracy, but among leaders who are far more authoritarian than he \never was. They will probably not listen to his ideas about democracy, but take account of how \nAkaev\u2019s relative tolerance of opposition voices \u2013 and his hesitation to use lethal force \u2013 resulted \nin a revolutionary situation that caused his own demise. \n \nAcknowledgments \nI thank Don Kalb and Julie McBrien for their stimulating comments on an earlier version of this \nessay. \n \nNotes \n1. For example, The New York Times (April 3, 2005) concluded that it turned out \u201cto be a plain, old coup\u201d. \n2. An early complaint about interim president Bakiev was that he used similar nepotistic methods as Akaev \ndid, tending to appoint relatives and friends to crucial posts in the administration. \n3. Without aiming to defend the term \u2018revolution\u2019 I hold that the events in Kyrgyzstan can be characterized \nas a \u2018revolutionary situation\u2019 in which efforts to transform political institutions were accompanied by mass \nmobilization and non-institutionalized action (Goldstone 2001: 142). I agree with Aya that instead of \ndefining revolutions by intentions or outcomes, analysis benefits more from focusing on the power \ndynamics in an \u201copen-ended situation of violent struggle wherein one set of contenders attempts to (\u2026) \ndisplace another from state power\u201d (1979: 40). \n 18 \n4. Mogilevsky and Hasanov (2004: 226-30) show a steep drop of GDP between 1991 and 1994 and a slow \nrecovery up to 2000, at which time GDP was still only 69 percent of the 1990 level. \n5.
