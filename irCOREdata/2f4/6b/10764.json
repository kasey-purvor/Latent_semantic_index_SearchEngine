Since that time there have been several changes of\nemphasis from teaching through subjects to teaching through contexts. The author\nconsiders some of the reasons for this oscillation and suggests some principles which a\nrenewed primary curriculum might be constructed upon. The author also suggests that a\nrenewed curriculum should place much greater emphasis upon the use of spoken language\nin the classroom and that much more consideration needs to be given to the challenges\nwhich change curriculum change poses for practitioners. For a number of reasons, it is\nsuggested that the term \u2018pragmatic\u2019 might be a good label for the curriculum of the future.<\/dc:description><dc:description>Full-text of this article is available at http:\/\/www.educationstudies.org.uk\/materials\/vol_1_issue_2_j_smith_final.pdf<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>British Education Studies Association (BESA)<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-07-29T13:26:13Z<\/dc:date><dc:type>Article<\/dc:type><dc:identifier>Educational futures, 2008, vol. 1, no. 2, pp. 63-74<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1758-2199<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2173\/75856<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.educationstudies.org.uk\/journal\/<\/dc:relation><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.educationstudies.org.uk\/materials\/vol_1_issue_2_j_smith_final.pdf<\/dc:relation><\/oai_dc:dc><\/metadata><\/record>","journals":null,"language":{"code":"en","id":9,"name":"English"},"relations":["http:\/\/www.educationstudies.org.uk\/journal\/","http:\/\/www.educationstudies.org.uk\/materials\/vol_1_issue_2_j_smith_final.pdf"],"year":2009,"topics":["Primary","Curriculum","Subject-teaching","Topic-teaching"],"subject":["Article"],"fullText":""}
