We assess the suitability of airborne radiometric3\ndata and digital elevation data as covariates to improve the precision of predictions of4\nSOC from an intensive survey in Northern Ireland. Radiometric data (K band) and, to5\na lesser extent, altitude are shown to increase the precision of SOC predictions when6\nthey are included in linear mixed models of SOC variation. However the statistical7\ndistribution of SOC in Northern Ireland is bimodal and therefore unsuitable for geo-8\nstatistical analysis unless the two peaks can be accounted for by the fixed effects in9\nthe linear mixed models. The upper peak in the distribution is due to areas of peat10\nsoils. This problem may be partly countered if soil maps are used to classify areas of11\nNorthern Ireland according to their expected SOC content and then different models12\nare fitted to each of these classes. Here we divide the soil in Northern Ireland into three13\nclasses, namely mineral, organo mineral and peat. This leads to a further increase in14\nthe precision of SOC predictions and the median square error is 2.2 %2. However a15\nsubstantial number of our observations appear to be mis-classified and therefore the16\nmean squared error in the predictions is larger (30.6 %2) since it is dominated by large17\nerrors due to mis-classification. Further improvement in SOC prediction may therefore18\nbe possible if better delineation between areas of large SOC (peat) and small SOC19\n(non-peat) could be achieved.20\n2\nPage 2 of 37European Journal of Soil Science\nFor Peer Review\nIntroduction21\nSoil organic carbon (SOC) is one of the most important constituents of the soil im-22\nparting structural stability, increased water holding capacity, acting as a source of23\nnutrients, and as a store of terrestrial carbon. The quantity of organic carbon in the24\ntop 30 cm of the soil profile typically reflects the interplay of several factors including25\nclimate (annual rainfall and temperature), elevation, local topography and land use.26\nSoil scientists require cost-effective methods to make accurate estimates of SOC con-27\ntent, which could be used to estimate soil-related carbon-dioxide emissions under the28\nUNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).29\nTraditional, grid-based sampling, with laboratory measurement and univariate30\ninterpolation of SOC is subject to large estimation uncertainties at unsampled points.31\nThese can be significantly reduced if intensive, secondary covariates such as data from32\nremote sensors are used for prediction by cokriging (McBratney & Webster, 1983),33\nregression kriging (Odeh et al., 1995), or the use of linear mixed models (Lark et34\nal., 2006). A variety of covariates have been shown to improve prediction of SOC.35\nFor example, terrain attributes and land use have been shown to be correlated with36\nSOC at multiple scales (Mueller & Pierce, 2003), whilst hyperspectral airborne data37\n(Selige et al., 2006), surface reflectance (Chen et al., 2000) and electrical conductivity38\n(Simbahan et al., 2006) was shown to be correlated with SOC in arable soils over scales39\nfrom a few to tens of kilometres. These secondary covariates are likely to be more or40\nless applicable in various types of soil environment (e.g. vegetated and unvegetated),41\nand at differing scales.42\nAnother potential covariate which can be used in both vegetated and unvege-43\ntated environments are measurements of gamma radiation from the decay of natural44\nradionuclides in the soil. This radiation can be measured using airborne sensors; the45\ndata correspond to the top 50 cm of a mineral-dominated soil, and depths of up to46\none metre in low density materials such as peat. Airborne radiometric survey has been47\nused extensively in Australia for digital soil mapping (Cook et al., 1996). Typically48\n3\nPage 3 of 37 European Journal of Soil Science\nFor Peer Review\nthe data on emissions are processed to generate values from three spectral bands which49\ncorrespond to the decay of potassium (K), thorium (Th) and uranium (U). In a recent50\nstudy in Australia, Minasny et al. (2006) combined data on radiometric K, land use51\nand terrain attributes to develop a depth-based function for estimation of SOC.52\nThere are two reasons why we might expect spatial correlation between gamma53\nemissions from the soil and its SOC content in the wetter landscape of north-western54\nEurope. First, the well-established spatial correlation between gamma-ray attenuation55\nand soil moisture (Carroll, 1981) extends to SOC because the latter accumulates in56\nsoils which are wet or waterlogged for much of the year. Water reduces the intensity57\nof gamma-rays significantly more than air; a 10% increase in soil water leads to a58\nreduction in K gamma radiation by the same amount (Minty, 1979). Second, for soil59\nwith a wide range of SOC contents, the mineral content (and gamma emission) will be60\nsmaller where organic matter contents are larger for soils derived from the same parent61\nmaterial (with similar mineral composition). As the organic matter content rises, the62\nmineral content declines in a simple, two-component composition. It may be possible63\nto use these relationships to improve SOC estimation in organic rich soils such as those64\nof the Arctic Tundra (Smith et al., 2004) or temperate latitudes such as Scotland and65\nWales (Scottish Executive, 2007), so this approach warrants further investigation.66\nThere have been relatively few regional-scale, airborne radiometric surveys of67\nlandscapes in which SOC contents represent significant terrestrial carbon stores \u2013 such68\nsurveys have been undertaken in Finland (Lilja & Nevalainen, 2005) and Sweden (Lun-69\nden et al., 2001). One example is the recently-completed Tellus survey of Northern70\nIreland (13 550 km2), in which SOC measurements and airborne geophysical surveys71\n(including the detection of gamma emitting radiation) were undertaken at around the72\nsame time. The aim of this paper is to determine to what extent airborne radiometric73\nsurvey data and terrain attributes can be used as secondary covariates to improve esti-74\nmates of SOC across the landscape of Northern Ireland. A second objective is to assess75\nwhether improvements in SOC estimation based on these covariates differs markedly76\n4\nPage 4 of 37European Journal of Soil Science\nFor Peer Review\nfor the three major soil types across this landscape. Also we explore whether the77\ninclusion of information on radiometric K means that the number of observations of78\nSOC required for adequate predictions is reduced. We discuss the implications of our79\nfindings for improving the estimation of SOC in cognate landscapes and some potential80\nlimitations to the application of airborne radiometric survey for this purpose.81\nMethods82\nStudy region and surveys83\nThe soils of Northern Ireland have been described by Cruickshank (1997) and comprise84\npoorly-drained gley soils (54%), peats and rankers (24%) and freely drained soils (16%)85\n\u2013 see Figure 1. In the soil surveys of Northern Ireland described by Cruickshank (1997)86\nsoil inspection pits were dug to between 80 and 90 cm. The larger proportion of gley87\nsoils by comparison to England, Wales and Scotland reflects the wetter environment88\nof Northern Ireland, where average annual rainfall for the vast majority of the region89\nis greater than 1 m, with a minimum of around 0.75 m. Large areas of the region90\nare more than 100 m above sea level, with a maximum attitude around 850 m, whilst91\ncentral and eastern areas have lower elevations (<40 m).92\nThe airborne geophysical survey of the whole of Northern Ireland was flown in93\nthe summers of 2005 and 2006. Radiometric data were collected with an Exploranium94\nGR820 256 channel gamma spectrometer system comprising 32 litres of downward95\nlooking NaI(Tl) detectors and 8 litres of upward looking detectors. Data were collected96\nevery second (approximately 70 m flight line distance). The gamma radiation measured97\ncomes from a shallow surface layer of no more than about 30 cm in rock, although this98\nwill increase for low-density unconsolidated materials, perhaps to a maximum of a few99\nmetres in dry peat. The ground area or footprint, from which most of the contribution100\nof gamma radiation comes, has the form of an ellipse elongated in the flight direction.101\nFor example, at 56 m altitude, 75% of the measured radiation will come from a width102\nof about 150 m, extending to around 220 m along the flight line (Pitkin & Duval, 1980).103\nSurvey lines were spaced 200 m apart and orientated NNW or SSE (165 and 345 \u25e6), with104\n5\nPage 5 of 37 European Journal of Soil Science\nFor Peer Review\ntie-lines 2000 m apart, and at right angles to the flight line directions, acquired only in105\nthe early part of the survey. The flying height was 56 m above ground in rural areas.106\nProcedures for processing the airborne radiometric data were based on those described107\nin AGSO and IAEA reference manuals (Grasty & Minty, 1995; IAEA, 1991). The108\nprocessing included corrections for aircraft and cosmic background radiation, aircraft109\naltitude and spectral interactions. The corrected count rates were used to estimate110\nthe concentration of the three radioelements across specific energy ranges (MeV): K111\n(1.37\u20131.57), U (1.66\u20131.86), Th (2.41 \u2013 2.81). The survey yielded ca. 1.2 million values112\nfor equivalent K(%) and Th (mg kg\u22121), U (mg kg\u22121) and man-made radionuclides,113\npredominantly 137Cs, although we do not consider the latter in this paper.114\nTo assess whether temporal fluctuations in soil moisture status during the pe-115\nriod of the airborne surveys was broadly representative of the long-term average, we116\nextracted from the MIDAS database (UK Meteorological Office) monthly rainfall data117\n(mm) throughout 2005 and 2006, along with average monthly rainfall between 1961118\nand 1990 for meteorological stations across Northern Ireland.119\nThe soil geochemical survey was undertaken between July 2004 and March 2006.120\nA sample of topsoil was collected from a site in every other square kilometre of the Irish121\nNational Grid, by simple random selection within each square, subject to the avoidance122\nof roads, tracks, railways, urban areas and other seriously disturbed ground. There were123\n6862 sample sites in total. At each site soil was taken with a hand auger from between124\ndepths of 5 and 20 cm from five holes at the corners and centre of a square with a side of125\nlength 20 m and combined to form a bulked sample. All samples of soil were air-dried126\nin a dedicated temperature controlled oven at 30 \u25e6C for 2\u20133 days and disaggregated.127\nFrom each a 50-g sub-sample was ground in an agate planetary ball mill. The total128\nconcentrations of 55 major and trace elements were determined in each sample by129\nwavelength and energy dispersive XRFS (X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry), although130\nwe only consider K (%), Th (mg kg\u22121) and U (mg kg\u22121) in this study. Soil organic131\ncarbon was estimated in each sample using loss-on-ignition analysis by heating a sub-132\n6\nPage 6 of 37European Journal of Soil Science\nFor Peer Review\nsample 450 \u25e6C for eight hours and multiplying the mass difference by 0.58 (Broadbent,133\n1953). The coefficient of variation for this method for 174 replicate analyses of a sample134\nstandard was 3.6%.135\nThe topographic data were a series of 50-m spaced observations for elevation136\n(m) covering Northern Ireland (Ordnance Survey of Northern Irelands data) based137\non airborne, photogrammetric acquisition; 65% of the data are accurate to \u00b1 1 metre.138\nSimple linear interpolators are often used to create continuous Digital Elevation Models139\n(DEMs; Moore et al., 1991) from stereo, aerial photo-derived point elevation data. We140\nused inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation to form a DEM surface in ESRI141\nArcMapTM .142\nWe used the DEM to estimate Compound Topographic Index (CTI) in ArcInfo143\nWorkStationTM which has been shown to be correlated with SOC content (Moore et al.,144\n1993). We extracted values for elevation (m) and CTI for the soil sampling locations145\nby point intersection.146\nWe used a spatial join procedure to associate each soil sampling observation with147\nits nearest radiometric survey observation. The median distance between the sample148\nsites and the corresponding radiometric measurement was 52 m, with an interquartile149\nrange of 47 m showing that the soil sampling locations fall entirely within the support of150\nthe airborne detector. We used digital versions of the (1:50,000) soil maps of Northern151\nIreland to form a three-fold classification of the soil sampling locations (see Figure 1):152\norganic soils (SOC > 20 % and > 50 cm in thickness; peats), organo mineral soils153\n(with an organic surface horizon overlying mineral subsoil; peaty podzols, rankers and154\nhumic-gleays) and mineral soils (no organic horizon and SOC< 10 %; brown-earths,155\npodzols, gleys and rankers).156\nExploratory analysis157\nThe appropriateness of using the airborne measurements of K, Th and U as auxiliary158\ninformation in a regional survey of SOC was initially explored by (i) comparing the159\nsummary statistics with those of the corresponding ground based variables (Table 1)160\n7\nPage 7 of 37 European Journal of Soil Science\nFor Peer Review\nand (ii) by calculating the correlation coefficients between the airborne and ground161\nbased variables and the estimates of SOC based upon LOI analysis (Table 2). Sim-162\nilarly we also explored the correlation of SOC with the two terrain variables. These163\nexploratory analyses were the basis for deciding on the variables to include in our164\nmodels of SOC variation.165\nWe calculated total annual rainfall for a subset of 20 meteorological stations166\nacross Northern Ireland for both 2005 and 2006, the years in which the airborne surveys167\nwere flown. A comparison of these data with the long-term, average annual rainfall168\n(1961-1990) indicated that they were of a similar magnitude. We also plotted monthly169\nrainfall totals for observations from several meteorological stations during 2005 and170\n2006 and compared these to the long-term monthly averages (1961-1990). There was no171\ncompelling evidence that rainfall throughout 2005 or 2006 was spatially or temporally172\nanomalous and so we feel justified in assuming that the soil moisture regime over the173\nperiod of the airborne survey was representative of its long-term variation.174\nSpatial analysis: linear mixed models175\nA prediction set of 3000 observations was randomly extracted from the SOC data set176\nand the remaining observations were used as a validation set. We considered linear177\nmixed models of the form178\nz = X\u03b2 + \u03b7, (1)\nwhere X is an n \u00d7 p design matrix containing values of p auxiliary variables or fixed179\neffects, \u03b2 is the length p vector containing the coefficients of the fixed effects and180\n\u03b7 \u223c N (0,V) is a vector of spatially correlated random residuals with a Gaussian181\ndistribution and covariance matrix V. We assume that the spatial correlation of \u03b7 can182\nbe represented by an isotropic nested nugget and Mate\u00b4rn variogram model183\n\u03b3 (h) = c0 + c1\n{\n1\u2212 1\n2\u03bd\u22121\n\u0393 (\u03bd)\n(\nh\na\n)\u03bd\nK\u03bd\n(\nh\na\n)}\nfor h > 0,\n\u03b3 (h) = 0 for h = 0, (2)\nwhere h is the lag distance separating observation pairs, \u03bd is a smoothing parameter,184\n8\nPage 8 of 37European Journal of Soil Science\nFor Peer Review\nK\u03bd a modified Bessel function of the second kind of order \u03bd (Abramowitz & Stegun,185\n1972) and \u0393 is the gamma function. Bessel and gamma functions may be calculated by186\nmany standard numerical packages such as IMSL (1994). The smoothness parameter187\ngives the Mate\u00b4rn function greater flexibility for modelling the spatial covariance than188\nmore commonly-used models such as the exponential and spherical models (Webster189\n& Oliver, 2007). For each fixed effects matrix we calculated \u03b2\u02c6, the estimate of \u03b2, by190\nordinary least squares, subtracted X\u03b2\u02c6 from the data and used the method of moments191\n(Matheron, 1962) to fit the vector of variogram parameters \u03b1 = (c0, c1, a, \u03bd). Following192\nCressie (1985), when fitting the variogram model to the experimental variogram by least193\nsquares we applied weights194\nwi =\nN (hi)\n\u03b3\u02c6 (hi)\n2 , (3)\nwhere N(hi) is the number of observation pairs within the bin centred on lag hi and195\n\u03b3\u02c6(hi) is the experimental variogram for hi. Generally the REML estimator is recom-196\nmended for fitting linear mixed models (Lark et al., 2006) because there is known to be197\nsome bias when the method of moments is applied. However for 3000 observations this198\nbias will be very small and does not justify the prohibitive computation time required199\nby REML.200\nWe fitted a number of linear mixed models with different fixed effects to the201\nprediction data to compare (i) the effectiveness of including different auxiliary variables202\nas fixed effects (ii) the effectiveness of fitting a single model for all soil types with the203\neffectiveness of fitting different models for each of our three broad soil classes and (iii)204\nhow the precision of the different linear mixed models varies with the intensity of SOC205\nobservations. The variables to be included as fixed effects were selected according to206\nthe findings of our exploratory analyses.207\nEach linear mixed model was fitted first to all the prediction data. The linear208\nmixed models assume that the random effects are Gaussian and therefore we log trans-209\nform the data if the skew is greater than 1 and this assumption is implausible (Webster210\n& Oliver, 2007). We note that strictly we should test the skew once we have subtracted211\n9\nPage 9 of 37 European Journal of Soil Science\nFor Peer Review\nthe fixed effects from the data. However this could lead to the data being transformed212\nfor some but not all of the models so in order to make fair comparisons between the213\ndifferent models we decide whether to transform based upon the skew of the raw data.214\nThe entire prediction set had skew equal to 2.03. Therefore a log transform was ap-215\nplied and the skew was reduced to 0.92. The empirical best linear unbiased predictor216\n(E-BLUP) was used to predict SOC content at the validation sites (Lark et al., 2006).217\nTo calculate the mean prediction in the original units \u2013 and the mean squared error218\nMSE between the predictions and observed SOC values at the validation sites \u2013 an219\nunbiased inverse log transform (Cressie, 2004) was performed.220\nThe prediction and validation data were then divided into the three soil classes221\naccording to our three-fold classification and separate models were fitted to the predic-222\ntion data from each class and the appropriate soil class model was used to predict SOC223\ncontent at each validation location by the E-BLUP. The skew for the SOC in mineral224\nsoil was 3.94 which was reduced to 0.80 by applying a log transform. No transform was225\napplied to data from the organo mineral and peat soil classes because they had skew226\nof 0.86 and -0.53 respectively.227\nThe values of SOC are substantially larger on peat soils than mineral soils and228\nsites at which the soil is mis-classified are likely to have large prediction errors which229\nwill dominate the MSE. We therefore also record the median square error (MdSE) and230\nthe MdSE based upon the back transform to the median prediction in the original231\nunits.232\nThis test was then repeated using random subsets of ns of the prediction data233\nwhere ns = 100, 200, . . . 2900, to explore how the quality of the predictions at the234\nvalidation sites varies with the number of SOC observations.235\nResults236\nExploratory analysis237\nThe airborne radiometric estimates of K and Th were strongly correlated with their238\nmeasurements in the soil survey (r=0.86 and 0.80 respectively; Table 2) which demon-239\n10\nPage 10 of 37European Journal of Soil Science\nFor Peer Review\nstrates that the airborne survey is an effective method for estimating these elements.240\nAirborne radiometric estimates of K exhibited a strong negative correlation with ground-241\nbased estimates of SOC (r= -0.51); this correlation was stronger than for Th, U and242\ntotal counts. We therefore chose to include radiometric K as a fixed effect in a linear243\nmixed model of SOC. Furthermore, plots of radiometric K against SOC (not shown)244\nsuggested that this relationship may be nonlinear and therefore the square of radio-245\nmetric K (K2) was also included as a fixed effect.246\nWe also explored the correlation of SOC with the two terrain parameters: altitude247\nand compound topographic index (CTI). First we transformed the SOC data to a248\nmore Gaussian distribution by taking natural logarithms; the transformed variable249\nhad a skewness coefficient of 0.94. The correlation coefficients (r) between log SOC250\nand altitude and CTI were, respectively: 0.6 and -0.03. Given the strong positive251\ncorrelation between SOC and altitude we chose to include the latter as a fixed effect252\nin the estimation of SOC.253\nThe histogram of the SOC observations across all soil types in Northern Ireland254\nis shown in Figure 2a. The distribution of SOC is bimodal. The main peak occurs255\nbetween 0 and 10 % and there is a secondary peak around 50 %, which corresponds to256\npeat soils. Bimodal distributions are not suited to geostatistical analyses and therefore257\nthis histogram vindicates our decision to analyse mineral, organo mineral and peat258\nsoils separately. We expect that mineral soils will have SOC less than 20 % and peat259\nsoils will have SOC greater than 20 %; this is the threshold adopted in Northern260\nIreland. According to the (1:50,000) soil map of Northern Ireland, 5552 (81.0 %) of261\nthe observations are from mineral soils, 382 (5.6 %) are from organo mineral soils and262\n915 (13.4 %) are from peat soils. Figures 2 b, c and d show the distribution of SOC263\nfor mineral, organo mineral and peat soils.264\nThe largest peak in the organo mineral soils is for SOC less than 10 % but there is265\na secondary peak greater than 50 %. Thus a substantial proportion of our observations266\nappear to be misclassified by the soil map. This is likely to be because the soil map267\n11\nPage 11 of 37 European Journal of Soil Science\nFor Peer Review\nis unsuitable for recognising very local variations in soil type. The soil classification is268\npartially successful in separating the observations with large and small SOC and the269\nsecondary peak is not evident in the mineral soil distribution. However, some larger270\nthan expected SOC values remain in the mineral soil set (4 % of mineral soils have271\nSOC greater than 20 %). The majority of peat soil observations have SOC greater272\nthan 40 % although 26 % of observations have SOC less than 20 %.273\nSpatial analysis: linear mixed models274\nThe effectiveness of six different linear mixed models of SOC variation were compared.275\nThe fixed effects for these models were:276\nModel 1 Constant (i. e. the mean),277\nModel 2 Constant and altitude,278\nModel 3 Constant and K,279\nModel 4 Constant, K and K2,280\nModel 5 Constant, altitude and K,281\nModel 6 Constant, altitude, K and K2.282\nFigures 3-6 show the variograms fitted to residuals of all soils, mineral soils, organo283\nmineral soils and peat soils respectively. On the all soils variogram the sill variance is284\nlargest when the fixed effects consist of a constant (the overall mean). The sill variance285\nis reduced when altitude is also included in the fixed effects and further reductions286\nare achieved by including radiometric K. The smallest variances are seen for Model 6.287\nA similar pattern is seen on the mineral soils variogram although the semi-variances288\nare substantially smaller for each model than the all soils variograms. For the organo289\nmineral and peat variograms the sill variances are again largest with constant fixed290\neffects and a greater reduction in these variances is achieved by including radiometric291\nK rather than altitude. There is some evidence of spatial correlation in the Model 1292\n(constant mean) variograms on organo mineral and peat soils but the proportion of293\nspatially correlated variation becomes smaller as other variables are added to the fixed294\neffects. This indicates that the spatial correlation has been resolved by the inclusion295\n12\nPage 12 of 37European Journal of Soil Science\nFor Peer Review\nof other variables in the fixed effects.296\nFigures 7-9 illustrate the different components of a single Model 6 linear mixed297\nmodel fitted on all soils types. The log SOC observations are presented in Figure 7, the298\ncontributions from the fixed effects are presented in Figure 8 and the residuals between299\nthe observations and fixed effect contributions are presented in Figure 9. The fixed300\neffects contain many of the large scale features of the observations such as large SOC301\nvalues in the NE, SE, SW and a cluster slightly NW of centre. The residuals show302\nless spatial structure, as would be expected from the almost all nugget variogram for303\nModel 6 in Figure 3.304\nThe MSEs between the observations and predictions at the validation sites are305\nshown in Table 3 and the MdSEs in Table 4. We indicate the number of soil classes into306\nwhich the prediction set is divided for fitting of the linear mixed model. The first two307\nrows of each table show the errors upon predicting SOC over the entire validation set.308\nIn the remaining six rows the validation set is divided according to the soil classification309\nand the errors for each classification are shown.310\nAs variables are added to the fixed effects the MSEs and MdSEs generally decrease311\nin the same pattern as the semi-variances in Figures 3-6 with the largest decreases312\noccurring when radiometric K is added to the fixed effects. This illustrates that SOC313\nis correlated with altitude but more effective information comes from radiometric K.314\nThe MSEs and MdSEs are smaller when separate models are fitted to each soil315\nclass than when the soil classes are combined. For example the smallest MSE for316\nthe model fitted to the entire prediction set is 41.08 %2 whereas the smallest MSE317\nwhen three separate models are fitted is 30.38 %2. The greatest improvement for three318\nmodels over one model is seen for peat, particularly when the fixed effects include319\nradiometric K. The MSEs for mineral soils when three models are fitted are slightly320\nlarger than those from a single model. We suspect that this is an artefact due to321\nthe large squared differences between predictions and observations which have been322\nmis-classified as mineral. To illustrate this Table 5 contains the MSEs for mineral323\n13\nPage 13 of 37 European Journal of Soil Science\nFor Peer Review\nsoils when only observations with SOC less than 20 % are included in the validation324\nset. Removing the observations from mineral soils which we assume are mis-classified325\nreduces the MSEs, and the MSEs for three models are now substantially less than those326\nfor one model. The MdSEs are consistently smaller than the MSEs further illustrating327\nthat the MSEs are dominated by classification errors.328\nFigure 9 compares root MSEs for SOC from Model 6 (the model which generally329\nhad the smallest MSE), Model 2 (the model with the smallest MSE of those models330\nwhich did not include radiometric K as a fixed effect) and Model 1 (the model with no331\nauxiliary information) against n. In each of these plots, separate models are fitted for332\neach soil class. The results are combined to give the MSE across Northern Ireland in (a)333\nand plots (b), (c) and (d) show the absolute differences over mineral, organo mineral334\nand peat soils respectively. In each plot a substantial improvement upon including335\nradiometric K in the fixed effects is evident. We also note that the precision of our336\npredictions decreases very slowly as n decreases.337\nDiscussion338\nThe distribution of SOC will be bimodal over any study region which contains both339\norganic and mineral soils. Thus if we wish to map SOC over such a region we must340\naddress the problem of applying geostatistics to bimodal distributions. By dividing the341\nstudy region into three soil classes based on a (1:50,000) soil map of Northern Ireland342\nwe substantially improved the precision of SOC predictions across Northern Ireland.343\nHowever a proportion of soils appeared to be mis-classified. The errors at these sites344\ndominate the MSEs which are much larger than the corresponding MdSEs which are345\nmore robust to a proportion of large errors due to mis-classification. Therefore further346\nimprovements in regional predictions should be based upon improving our ability to347\ndifferentiate peat and non peat soils. Some mis-classification may be inevitable because348\nit is not practical to create soil maps which resolve very small scale deposits of organic349\nor mineral soil. This classification may be significantly improved by using airborne350\nhyperspectral data (McMorrow et al., 2004) or satellite data (e.g. ASTER or Landsat).351\n14\nPage 14 of 37European Journal of Soil Science\nFor Peer Review\nEven without such improvements, the approach we describe could be applied to the352\ndata from the Tellus survey in combination with data on soil bulk density to improve353\ncurrent estimates of carbon pools across Northern Ireland, in which peat soils are354\nestimated to account for more than 50% of the total (Cruickshank et al., 1998).355\nFurther work is required to elucidate the factors influencing the airborne esti-356\nmates of radiometric K and its spatial correlation with SOC for each of the three soil357\ntypes. The two dominant factors which influence this are: i) the variation in mineral-K358\ncontent; this decreases with increasing quantities of soil organic matter, and ii) increas-359\ning soil-moisture resulting in greater attenuation of the gamma signal from the soil.360\nThis would require contemporaneous measurements of soil moisture content which we361\ndo not have from the original survey.362\nThere are likely to be limitations to the widespread application of airborne radio-363\nmetric data as a covariate for mapping SOC. First, it relies upon a spatial correlation364\nbetween SOC and long-term (i.e. annual) soil moisture content which is only likely365\nto occur in certain combinations of climate, topography and land use where SOC has366\naccumulated above some minimum threshold. The soils of northern Europe include sig-367\nnificant areas with soils common to those in northern Ireland, particularly the Gleysols368\nand Histosols of northern Scandanavia, the Baltic States and Russia. Further work is369\nrequired to establish the utility of airborne radiometric data as a covariate for map-370\nping SOC, particularly for the large area of Podzols across northern Europe (European371\nSoil Bureau Netowrk, 2005). Second, patterns of antecedent rainfall conditions and the372\nquantity of precipitation during the airborne survey may cause unusually large temporal373\nand spatial variations in soil moisture contents across the study area. This may reduce374\nthe degree of spatial correlation between SOC and the gamma radiation which is due to375\ngreater attenuation of the latter where the ground is wetter and where carbon accumu-376\nlates. To address this potential limitation, it may be possible to ensure surveys are not377\nflown when significantly atypical soil moisture conditions occur, based on antecedent378\nrainfall data and medium-term precipitation forecasts. In addition, laboratory-based379\n15\nPage 15 of 37 European Journal of Soil Science\nFor Peer Review\nsoil column experiments, in which in-situ measurements of gamma radiation are made380\nunder controlled soil moisture conditions for soils with range of SOC contents, could be381\nused to calibrate the relationship between airborne radiometric data and SOC based382\non antecendent rainfall data. Finally, where the soil parent material contains very little383\nK (0.5 %), such as quartzite, the accuracy of airborne radiometric estimation of soil-K384\nmay be insufficient. However, 90 % of European soils contain more than 0.83 % K (or385\n1 % K2O; Salminen, 2005) suggesting that for the vast majority of soils, accuracy near386\nthe limit of detection is unlikely to be problematic.387\nOne of the main applications of SOC maps is the estimation of carbon stocks.388\nWhere soil carbon is concentrated in the upper horizons, radiometry may be partic-389\nularly useful as a covariate as it measures gamma radiation from the upper 35 cm of390\nthe solum. However, in deep organic-rich soils or areas of Arctic tundra where SOC391\nmay be transported to depth by cryoturbation (Ping et al., 1997), the utility of gamma392\nradiometry will be diminished because no information is provided for the deeper parts393\nof the soil profile.394\nConclusions395\nOur results show that the precision of regional predictions of SOC across Northern396\nIreland are substantially improved by including auxiliary information on radiometric397\nK from airborne surveys as fixed effects in a linear mixed model of SOC variation. To398\na lesser extent the precision is also improved by including altitude in the linear mixed399\nmodel. We have also seen that the number of observations of SOC may be substantially400\nreduced with little cost in terms of the precision of the predictions. However the401\nMSEs between predictions and observations are still large even when radiometric K402\nand altitude are included in the linear mixed model. This is because SOC in Northern403\nIreland has a bimodal distribution which is not suited to geostatistical analyses. After404\nseparating the soil into three main classes (mineral, organo mineral and organic), the405\nMSEs are substantially reduced. However, large independent validation errors occur406\nat certain mis-classified sites where, for example, the soil map shows a mineral soil but407\n16\nPage 16 of 37European Journal of Soil Science\nFor Peer Review\nits SOC content indicates it is organic. Improvements in our ability to differentiate408\nbetween mineral and organic-rich soils are required to make better predicitions of the409\nSOC at the regional scale.410\nAcknowledgements411\nThe Tellus surveys were financed in Northern Ireland by the the Department of En-412\nterprise, Trade and Investment and the \u2019Building Sustainable Prosperity\u2019 scheme of413\nthe Rural Development Programme.
