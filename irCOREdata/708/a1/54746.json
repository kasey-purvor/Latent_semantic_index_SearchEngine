Six groundwater 21 \nlevel time series and an associated river stage time series from the unconfined Chalk aquifer (a 22 \ndual-porosity, fractured limestone aquifer) in the Pang-Lambourn catchment, UK, have been 23 \nanalysed. Surrogate data of time series with known scaling properties have been used to estimate 24 \nthe probability distribution of the spectral and geometric scaling exponents determined by 25 \nDetrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) and Power Spectral Density (PSD) respectively; robust 26 \nregression techniques have been used to improve estimates of the scaling exponents; and robust 27 \nnon-parametric techniques have been used to correlate scaling exponents with features of the 28 \nboreholes and catchments. Strong statistical support has been found for temporal scaling of 29 \ngroundwater levels over a wide range of time scales, however, bootstrap estimates of the scaling 30 \nexponents indicate a much larger range of exponents than found by previous studies, suggesting 31 \nthat the uncertainty in existing estimates of scaling exponents may be too small. There is robust 32 \nevidence that geometrical scaling properties at each borehole can be related to the depth of the 33 \nobservation boreholes and distance of those boreholes from the river in the catchment, but no 34 \nsuch correlations were found for the spectral scaling exponents. The results build on the body of 35 \nevidence that groundwater levels, as with many hydrogeological phenomena, may be well 36 \nmodeled with mathematical concepts from statistical mechanics that do not attempt to capture 37 \nevery detail of these highly heterogeneous and complex systems. 38 \n 39 \nKEYWORDS: groundwater level; fractal scaling; spectral analysis; detrended fluctuation 40 \nanalysis; 41 \n42 \n3 \n Introduction 43 \nMean groundwater levels in unconfined aquifers are affected by the catchment water balance and 44 \nbulk aquifer parameters, while individual perturbations and seasonal variations in groundwater 45 \nlevels can be ascribed to individual rainfall events and seasonal variations in the driving 46 \nvariables. However, recharge and discharge phenomena act over a wide range of spatial (pore to 47 \ncatchment) and temporal (minutes to hundreds of years) scales, and are affected by a range of 48 \noften highly non-linear processes and can be subject to feedbacks. They are influenced by highly 49 \nheterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields found in aquifers, and are controlled by spatio-50 \ntemporally varying driving variables, such as precipitation and evapo-transpiration. 51 \nConsequently, groundwater levels in unconfined aquifers never achieve a steady state and may 52 \nvary over multiple spatial and temporal scales, and there is some recent evidence that 53 \ngroundwater levels may show scale-invariant, or fractal behaviour (Zhang and Schilling, 2004). 54 \nTypically, models of groundwater levels are based on conceptual process models which 55 \nrepresent mechanisms associated with catchment discharge, recharge, saturated flow, baseflow 56 \nand runoff. However, although process models have a long history and have proved to be 57 \ninvaluable for understanding the physical basis of groundwater flow dynamics, it is recognised 58 \nthat there are problems with such an approach. Prediction with all such classical deterministic 59 \nprocess models is constrained by several mathematical limitations: (1) measurement error, 60 \nnonlinearity and sensitivity to boundary conditions (chaos) (Smale, 1967), (2) model error 61 \n(McSharry and Smith, 2004), and (3) inaccessible parameters and variables. Chaos occurs in 62 \nmany nonlinear systems when the temporal evolution of the model amplifies the error in the 63 \nmeasurement of the boundary conditions: after a time, the state of the system becomes 64 \npractically unpredictable, because the boundary conditions cannot be known to infinite precision. 65 \nModel error occurs when the perfect model of the system is not known: it is usually the case that 66 \nthe model represents a simplification of a multitude of interacting, and often poorly-understood 67 \nmechanisms. Finally, it is impossible to measure the parameters and variables of the aquifer at 68 \nevery spatial location \u2013 this poses a particular problem for the highly spatially heterogeneous 69 \nnature of aquifers \u2013 exacerbating the uncertainty in predictions produced by the model. 70 \nSuch problems with process models are not unique to hydrogeology: in meteorology for 71 \nexample, it has long been recognized that chaos and model error fundamentally limit prediction 72 \n4 \n(Eady, 1951; Lorenz, 1963). The contemporary solution is essentially probabilistic: predictions 73 \nare made that attempt to represent the full uncertainty due to chaos, produced by many 74 \nrandomized perturbations of the boundary conditions and model equations called ensemble 75 \nmethods (Buizza 2003). The successes of this approach have precipitated a major conceptual 76 \nshift from deterministic to probabilistic modelling. 77 \nThis shift may help to mitigate the mathematical limitations of process hydrogeological 78 \npredictions, but it is not clear that this can also satisfactorily address the effect of high spatial 79 \nheterogeneity coupled with inaccessible parameters, variables and boundary conditions (Beven, 80 \n2006). In practice, this may make it impossible to produce detailed predictions of groundwater 81 \nlevels with the same accuracy as, for example, daily surface temperatures. It may well be that the 82 \nsuccesses of groundwater level predictions resulting from process models calibrated against a 83 \nfew aquifer measurements could be the result of overfitting: that is, these predictions are accurate 84 \nunder limited conditions such as short time intervals or locations close to the borehole, but are 85 \nerroneous for longer intervals or unmeasured sites. 86 \nA different, but useful, kind of statistical prediction may be possible with models rooted 87 \nin the theory of statistical mechanics, as suggested by Eady (1951). These models have their 88 \norigins as explanations for the observed bulk properties of gasses and fluids, where we are 89 \nignorant about the state variables of each particle, but precise statements can be derived about 90 \nstatistical properties of the model variables and derived quantities (Ruelle, 1984). This is similar 91 \nto the situation with unmeasured variables and heterogeneous parameters in aquifers, and 92 \nstatistical mechanics models might therefore be co-opted to make predictions about the bulk 93 \nproperties of aquifers. Critically, these models use few parameters that must be inferred from 94 \nmeasurements, significantly reducing the risk of overfitting. 95 \nClassical statistical mechanics explains the bulk statistical properties of simple systems 96 \nsuch as ideal gasses. However, many, more complex, systems from diverse disciplinary origins 97 \nshow remarkably similar scale-invariant statistical fluctuations of their state variables. These 98 \nfluctuations are statistically self-affine at all length scales, and this is one defining property of 99 \nstochastic fractals (Falconer, 2003). Time series which have stochastic fractal noise, with power 100 \nspectral density that scales as \u03b2\u2212f , where f is frequency and \u03b2 is the spectral scaling exponent, 101 \nhave been observed from diverse disciplines. This has prompted theoretical explanations such as 102 \n5 \nself-organised criticality (SOC) (Bak et al., 1988), expansion-modification systems (Li 1991), 103 \nand lattice gas density fluctuations (Jensen, 1990). For example, SOC proposes that under 104 \nconstant small input flux, a local storage mechanism overflows into neighboring regions upon 105 \nexceeding a capacity threshold. This situation causes cascading overflows on all length scales: 106 \ntime series from these simple models show scaling behaviour which is insensitive to variations in 107 \nthe model parameters. This suggests that this scaling behaviour is in some senses a universal 108 \nproperty of complex media. 109 \nSince the pioneering work of Hurst (1951) on reservoir capacities, temporal and spatial 110 \nscaling behaviour has been observed in time series of many natural systems, including: 111 \nearthquakes (Olami et al., 1992); fluvial and landscape evolution (Chase, 1992; Phillips, 2006; 112 \nMurray and Fonstad, 2007); sandpiles (Bak et al., 1988); chemical reactions at mineral pore 113 \ninterfaces (Wells  et al., 1991); rainfall (Lovejoy and Schertzer, 1985; Tessier et al., 1996); 114 \nevapo-transpiration (Famiglietti et al., 2008); river water quality (Kircher et al., 2001); and 115 \nrunoff and river discharge (Pelletier and Turcotte, 1997; Kantelhardt et al., 2006; Koscielny-116 \nBunde et al., 2006). To add to this list of scale invariant phenomena, Zhang and co-workers 117 \n(Zhang and Schilling, 2004; Zhang and Li, 2005, 2006; Li and Zhang, 2007) have recently 118 \ndescribed scale invariance in groundwater levels from a single catchment on a till\/loess system in 119 \nthe USA. These observations, along with the described mathematical limitations of classical 120 \nprocess model predictions of groundwater levels and the utility of simple statistical mechanical 121 \nmodels to explain scaling behaviour, are compelling arguments for the application of a statistical 122 \nmechanical approach to the modelling of groundwater levels in permeable aquifers.  123 \nHowever, there remain many open questions. For example: how statistically reliable is 124 \nthe evidence supporting the scaling hypothesis for groundwater systems, and, how confident can 125 \nwe be about the typical range of scaling exponents? These questions must first be addressed 126 \nbefore we can ask how these ranges of exponents relate to our current understanding of 127 \ncatchment characteristics, and what they tell us about any organizing principles that may control 128 \nthe scaling of groundwater levels. Unfortunately, answering these questions directly is 129 \ncomplicated by the lack of theoretical understanding of the asymptotic statistical properties of 130 \nthe techniques (Mandelbrot and Wallis, 1969). This leaves residual doubts about the reliability of 131 \nthese findings which, in other contexts, have historically been subject to substantial revisions 132 \n(Hamed, 2007). 133 \n6 \nOur main aim in this paper therefore is to provide more robust empirical evidence of 134 \nscaling properties of groundwater levels backed up by extensive computation and two key 135 \nstatistical innovations: surrogate data and robust regression. Surrogate data are generated time 136 \nseries whose temporal scaling properties are known: synthesizing many of these time series 137 \nallows bootstrap estimates of the distribution of scaling properties of the groundwater level time 138 \nseries under examination. Similarly, estimating temporal scaling properties requires straight-line 139 \nregression of points on log-log scales, but classical least-squares regression is adversely affected 140 \nby outliers, where robust regression is not. Using these innovations we explore computationally 141 \nthe statistical performance of spectral and geometric techniques for estimating temporal scaling 142 \nexponents under known conditions. Having quantified this performance, we extend this to 143 \nanalysis of the unknown scaling properties of groundwater levels. Finally, we use robust non-144 \nparametric techniques to correlate these robustly estimated scaling exponents with features of the 145 \nboreholes and their location in the catchment. 146 \nMethods 147 \nOur first task is to assess the evidence for scaling behaviour in borehole data. Firstly, we describe 148 \nthe classical formalism for stochastic fractal time series, which will allow analytical 149 \ncomparisons. We are interested in the class of time series, x(t) ,that are Gaussian stochastic 150 \nprocesses (that is, a set of Gaussian random variables indexed by the real time index t), with the 151 \nproperty that var[x(t1) \u2013 x(t2)] \u221d |t1 \u2013 t2|2H  for arbitrary time indices t1, t2. This condition implies 152 \nthat x(t) and s-H x(st) have the same distribution, for all scale factors s > 0. The parameter H is the 153 \nscaling exponent (also known as the Hurst exponent) of the self-similar process. As H increases, 154 \nthe resulting stochastic time series becomes smoother. Since the autocorrelation can be 155 \ncalculated directly from this definition, it is also straightforward to show (Falconer, 2003) that 156 \nthe power spectrum X(f) = f-\u03b2 , where the spectral scaling exponent \u03b2 = 2H + 1. The 157 \nmeasurements in this study are available at fixed time intervals, where tn = n \u2022 \u2206t , i.e. we have xn 158 \n= x(tn). We can simulate approximately self-similar Gaussian time series at these time points 159 \nnt using the inverse discrete-time Fourier transform (hereafter, this is referred to as the power 160 \nspectral method, PSM). Furthermore, we can estimate the spectral scaling exponent using the 161 \nforward discrete-time Fourier transform, and since \u2013logX(f)\/log f  = \u03b2, the slope of the log-log 162 \n7 \nplot of f against X(f) is an estimate of the spectral scaling exponent. We call this the power 163 \nspectral density (PSD) scaling exponent estimation method. 164 \nThe statistical self-similarity of the time series suggests an alternative formalism related 165 \nto broken-line processes (Bras and Rodr\u00edguez-Iturbe, 1985). The random midpoint displacement 166 \n(RMD) algorithm can simulate approximately self-affine Gaussian time series on nt . For a time 167 \nseries of length N that is a power of two, it involves successive subdivision in stages numbered k 168 \n= 1, 2\u2026log2 N, and in the first stage the midpoint is set to xN\/2 = 1\/2 (xN + x1) + \u03b5, where \u03b5  is a 169 \nGaussian random variable of zero mean. We then linearly interpolate the time points between [1, 170 \nN\/2] and between [N\/2, N]. The next stage, k = 2, sets the new midpoints N\/4, 3N\/4 according to 171 \nthe same random midpoint displacement scheme. This process repeats until all time points are 172 \ncalculated. The variance of \u03b5  at each stage is set to [1 - 22H-2] \/ 22kH . 173 \nSimilarly, the scaling exponent of self-affine time series can also be estimated using 174 \nsuccessive subdivision. By definition, the standard deviation (fluctuation) over any sub-interval 175 \nof length L of the Gaussian time series, will be approximately LH (Falconer, 2003). Therefore, we 176 \ncan estimate H by first dividing up the time series into sub-intervals of length L, estimating the 177 \nvariance of each sub-interval, and averaging over each standard deviation estimate. Then, by 178 \nincreasing L and repeating the standard deviation calculations over this new sub-interval size, we 179 \ncan estimate H by the slope of the log-log plot of L against the average standard deviation of sub-180 \nintervals at each L. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) proposes two advances over this basic 181 \nalgorithm. Firstly, although self-affine time series are essentially unbounded (as the variance 182 \nincreases with L), groundwater level time series are bounded, so that estimates of the larger 183 \nscales are poor. By integrating the time series with the mean removed, i.e. by calculating  184 \n[ ]( )\u2211 = \u2212=\nn\ni in\nxExx\n1\n\u02c6 , estimates of the scaling at larger sub-intervals are improved. Secondly, 185 \nmost groundwater level time series have trends and other local variations due to factors such as 186 \nclimate variation. By removing local linear trends in each sub-interval (by fitting a straight line 187 \nor higher-order polynomial to the integrated time series nx\u02c6  and subtracting this), estimates of H 188 \ninsensitive to these trends can be obtained. It can be shown (Heneghan and McDarby, 2000) \u03b1 , 189 \nthe spectral scaling exponent, given by the slope of the log-log plot of L against the average 190 \nstandard deviation F(L)  is equal to H \u2013 1, which is the effect of integrating to obtain nx\u02c6 . 191 \n8 \nHere we introduce an innovation to obtain more robust estimates of groundwater level 192 \nscaling exponents \u03b1 and \u03b2. Reliable scaling exponent estimates generally require that the log-log 193 \nplots lie on a straight line (are collinear) over a very large range of length scales. This is often 194 \ndifficult to obtain in practice, because most groundwater level time series are short or have 195 \nmeasurement error that may well be temporally correlated. Either the smallest or largest scales 196 \nwill be unusable, or there may be length scales that are outliers, in the sense that although most 197 \nof the points are collinear, a few points are not, and we wish to discard these when using line 198 \nfitting to estimate the slope. The literature on techniques for addressing this problem of spurious 199 \ndata coming from a very different distribution to the rest is called collectively \u201crobust statistics\u201d. 200 \nThroughout this paper, when we use the term \u201crobust\u201d this is the intended meaning. We use 201 \niteratively reweighted least squares line-fitting with Huber penalty function (Hastie et al., 2001), 202 \nwhich concentrates the slope estimate only on those points that are most collinear. It should be 203 \nnoted that this effectively circumvents analysis of crossovers \u2013 potential changes in scaling 204 \nproperties at different time scales \u2013 but gives more reliable estimates of the overall scaling 205 \nbehaviour, which is the main aim of this paper. As a demonstration of the value of robust 206 \nregression in this application, we generated PSM and RMD time series across 21 values of \u03b1 in 207 \nthe range [0.5, 2.0]. Using ordinary least squares and robust regression, we computed the average 208 \nerror in the DFA estimate of \u03b1, over 10 repetitions for each value of \u03b1. The root-mean square 209 \nerror of the estimate of \u03b1 with ordinary least squares, from PSM and RMD data was 0.17. Using 210 \nrobust regression, the error was reduced to 0.10 (PSM) and 0.07 (RMD), illustrating the fact that 211 \nrobust regression can lead to marked improvements in scaling exponent estimation. 212 \nWith these methods we can obtain, given a single borehole time series, values for the 213 \nscaling exponents \u03b1 and \u03b2. However, the statistical mechanical hypothesis holds that the 214 \ngroundwater system is effectively stochastic, which implies that the resulting scaling exponents 215 \nare random variables. Estimates of exponents from a single time series will simply reflect the 216 \nstatistical variation in that set of measurements, and a true representation of the scaling 217 \nexponents must be given by the distribution over the exponents. Unfortunately, a concise 218 \nmathematical description of this distribution is lacking and for the purposes of this study it is 219 \nreasonable to estimate this distribution by computational means, in particular, by bootstrapping 220 \nwith surrogate data. The surrogate data in this case are time series obtained using the PSM and 221 \nRMD methods generated using scaling exponents estimated using the PSD and DFA methods on 222 \n9 \nthe borehole time series data. Note that we cannot rely on PSM or RMD surrogates alone 223 \nbecause there are subtle statistical differences between the time series they generate, differences 224 \nthat arise from the algorithmic details (Bras and Rodr\u00edguez-Iturbe, 1985). Assessing the extent to 225 \nwhich scaling exponent measurement methods are sensitive to these statistical differences is an 226 \nimportant issue that, to our knowledge, has not been addressed in the context of groundwater 227 \nsystems. 228 \nData 229 \nThe groundwater level and river stage data used in this study, come from a research site at 230 \nBoxford, Berkshire, UK, Figure 1. The study site has been previously described by (Gooddy et 231 \nal., 2006), but is summarized here. It is centered on the River Lambourn, a rural, predominantly 232 \ngroundwater-fed catchment (~200km2, Baseflow Index 0.96, mean flow ~1.75m3sec-1) which 233 \ndrains part of the Chalk aquifer of the Berkshire Downs. The site is underlain by thin soils, 234 \ntypically <1m thick. Alluvial sands and gravels are present adjacent to and below the river to a 235 \ndepth of about 3m, these in turn overlie up to 200m of Chalk. The Chalk is the main regional 236 \naquifer in the UK, with a mean matrix porosity of 39%, mean storage coefficient of 0.006, and 237 \ntransmissivity in the range 0.5 to ~8000 m2d-1 with a geometric mean of 620 m2d-1 (Bloomfield 238 \net al., 1995; Allen et al., 1997). 239 \nGroundwater levels have been monitored at six locations at the site and the river level has 240 \nbeen monitored using a stilling well for up to five years, Table 1. Water levels at the monitoring 241 \nlocations were measured using pressure transducers and data loggers with a measuring range of 242 \n10mH2O and a measurement resolution of 0.2cmH2O. The sampling rate was either hourly or at 243 \n15-minute intervals. The resulting time series lengths varied from N = 19,750 to N = 49,133, 244 \nTable 1. The number of missing measurements was at most 0.1% of the total length of each 245 \nseries, therefore these gaps are ignored in subsequent analysis, since this percentage of missing 246 \nentries is too small to have a statistically detectable  effect on the estimated scaling exponents. 247 \nEach of the seven water level time series has been normalized to the range [-1, 1] for subsequent 248 \nanalysis, Figure 2.  249 \n10 \nResults 250 \nThe performance of the PSD and DFA methods on PSM and RMD bootstrap time series are 251 \nshown in Figure 3. Minimum\/maximum values were assessed by generating 100 fractal time 252 \nseries with the same algorithm. As expected, the PSD method performs almost perfectly on PSM 253 \nnoise, because the method of generating the noise and measuring its scaling exponent are 254 \nessentially the same. On RMD noise, however, the PSD method performs quite poorly for 255 \nexponents \u03b2 < 1 and \u03b2 > 2. The DFA method performs well for PSM time series with exponents 256 \n\u03b1 < 1.2, but otherwise, it shows a significant deviation away from the true value, although the 257 \ndeviation is not as severe as with PSD on RMD noise. Finally, the DFA method performs very 258 \nwell for RMD noise for \u03b1 > 0.8; for \u03b1 < 0.8, there is a significant deviation away from the true 259 \nvalue, but again not as severe as with PSD applied to RMD noise. These findings suggest that, 260 \nexcept for the PSD method on RMD noise with high \u03b2, although an exact value for the scaling 261 \nexponent is not always possible, the estimated scaling value always increases with the true value, 262 \nsuch that comparisons between estimated values are always indicative of a comparison between 263 \nthe underlying, true values. 264 \nHaving described the techniques, we now apply these to the normalized water level time 265 \nseries. Figure 4 shows log-log plots of DFA sub-interval size L against fluctuation F(L), and 266 \nfrequency bin i against power spectral amplitude |X(i)|2 of the time series xn. It also shows the 267 \nscaling exponents \u03b1 and \u03b2 for each time series (estimated using robust regression for the log-log 268 \nline fitting). The DFA sub-intervals ranged on a logarithmic scale from L = 4 to L = N\/2 points. 269 \nThis range is chosen for computational reasons: we need enough points to get a reasonable 270 \nestimate of the trend fitting (hence at least L = 4), and enough DFA sub-intervals for the 271 \nfluctuation estimates to be reliable (requiring at most L = N\/2). The PSD frequency bins ranged 272 \nfrom i = 2 to i = N\/20, because the power spectral scaling did not extend past this range of 273 \nfrequencies. 274 \nFigure 4 shows that, over the range of time scales where scaling behaviour could be 275 \nreliably estimated, the data can be well modeled by a random fractal stochastic process, both in 276 \nterms of spectral (PSD) and geometric (DFA) scaling. In order to assess whether there is any 277 \nstatistically significant difference between these exponents on the different water level time 278 \nseries, we generated a new set of 20 realizations of stochastic processes with the same scaling 279 \n11 \nexponents as estimated from the data. Since the DFA method is most reliable on RMD noise, we 280 \nused RMD realizations for \u03b1 estimates, and for the same reason, for the PSD method used PSM 281 \nrealizations for the \u03b2 estimates. Figure 5 shows the result, where the distributions are obtained 282 \nusing Gaussian kernel density estimation. This shows that the distributions of the scaling 283 \nexponents are clearly quite different for each water level time series, for both spectral and 284 \ngeometric exponents. Using the non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we find that all 285 \ndistributions are significantly different (p < 0.05, n = 20) for all pairwise combinations of water 286 \nlevel series. The obtained values of the scaling exponents are summarized in Table 2. 287 \nWe also assessed the extent of (non-parametric) correlation between selected geometric 288 \nproperties of the borehole and the fractal scaling exponents (see Table 3). This shows that 289 \nalthough the spectral scaling \u03b2 is not significantly correlated with the distance of the observation 290 \npoint from either the river or the stilling well in the river (site PL26U), or with the mean 291 \nobservation depth, the geometric scaling exponent \u03b1 shows large correlations with all these 292 \nparameters. 293 \nDiscussion 294 \nIn this study, we assessed the evidence for random fractal scaling behaviour in groundwater level 295 \ntime series, towards providing evidence on which to advance statistical mechanical models of the 296 \ndynamics of unconfined aquifers. Having noted the connection between statistical mechanical 297 \nmodels and self-affine time series, we formally defined spectrally scaled Gaussian stochastic and 298 \nstatistically self-affine time series. We then described two methods for generating such time 299 \nseries with given scaling exponents, and rehearsed two complementary methods for estimating 300 \nthe scaling exponents from time series. Using innovations to improve the robustness of these 301 \nestimation techniques, we applied them to water level time series from an unconfined aquifer and 302 \nfound scaling behaviour over a wide range of time scales. Using nonparametric techniques, we 303 \nfound robust statistical evidence that different groundwater level series exhibit different scaling 304 \nproperties. We also find evidence that the geometric scaling properties at each borehole are 305 \nrelated to the basic physical layout of the aquifer, in particular to the distance from the river and 306 \ndepth of the observation zone. However, we found that the spectral scaling properties of the time 307 \nseries were unrelated to aspects of the physical layout of the aquifer that we tested. 308 \n12 \nThese findings build on the growing body of evidence that supports the scaling 309 \nhypothesis in groundwater levels (Zhang and Schilling, 2004; Li and Zhang, 2007), and extends 310 \nthe observation to more permeable aquifers than previously reported. The bootstrap estimates of 311 \nthe geometric (DFA) scaling exponent range from around 1.20 to 1.65 (Figure 5), which agrees 312 \napproximately with the range found by Li and Zhang (2007), i.e. 1.28 to 1.64. However, 313 \nbootstraps lead to much larger ranges of scaling exponents than those found previously \u2013 our 314 \nsuggestion is that the uncertainty in existing estimates is too small. 315 \nAlso in agreement with Li and Zhang (2007), we found that the geometrical \u2018roughness\u2019 316 \nof the time series decreases with increasing distance from one of the external driving sources 317 \n(here, the river flow), which is physically intuitive because the aquifer is a storage medium that 318 \ntends to \u2018dampen\u2019 short-time variations in driving variables. We quantified this relationship as 319 \nbeing particularly strong, with a correlation coefficient r > 0.8. A novel finding is that this 320 \nrelationship is not detected in spectral scaling exponents. Considering that for some of the 321 \nboreholes, the estimated spectral scaling exponents \u03b2 > 2.0, and given the poor performance of 322 \nspectral methods on RMD noise for such high values of \u03b2, we caution against any physical 323 \ninterpretations of these results based on spectral methods that are sensitive only to statistical 324 \nmeans and covariances. Although our findings agree with that of Li and Zhang, the evidence 325 \npresented here suggests that classical linear spectral analysis cannot reliably extract sufficient 326 \ninformation from groundwater time series to detect relationships between scaling behaviour and 327 \naspects of the physical configuration of catchments. 328 \nOur methods were designed exclusively to improve the robustness of the evidence of the 329 \nbasic scaling hypothesis in groundwater levels, so we cannot compare existing crossover 330 \nfindings (Li and Zhang, 2007) with our results. However, a natural extension of this study would 331 \nbe to devise similarly robust methods across limited ranges of time scales, and also of interest in 332 \nfuture work would be the investigation of multifractal scaling (Kantelhardt et al., 2006). 333 \nConclusions 334 \nOur main conclusion is that these results provide a sound statistical basis for supporting the 335 \ninvestigation of simple statistical mechanical models as highly parsimonious dynamical 336 \nexplanations for the behaviour of groundwater levels. Classical linear models for groundwater 337 \nflow would be unable to parsimoniously represent fractal scaling \u2013 a statistical mechanical model 338 \n13 \nmay actually be simpler, because classical linear systems require infinite memory to replicate the 339 \nself-similar behaviour of the measured groundwater levels, whereas nonlinear models require 340 \nonly finite memory. More details of this line of reasoning can be found in Bras and Rodriguez-341 \nIturbe (1985). 342 \nWe hope that these findings motivate further research into statistical mechanical 343 \nmodelling of such systems, as a complementary approach to classical process-based modelling. 344 \nFor example, there is the need to discover dynamical explanations for these findings, in terms of 345 \nparameter ranges and simple statistical state transition rules. Also needed is a comparison of 346 \nthese results against simulations from existing numerical groundwater models. 347 \nThese results suggest that an explanation for the scale invariance of groundwater levels in 348 \nunconfined aquifers as a \u2018complex\u2019 response to constantly changing driving inputs and boundary 349 \nconditions (including boundaries imposed by management regimes) should be considered. These 350 \nobservations should provide additional impetus to the search for underlying organizing principles 351 \nthat may relate the scaling characteristics of recharge, groundwater head and discharge in 352 \npermeable catchments. 353 \n 354 \nAcknowledgements 355 \nSome of the data described was obtained as part of the Natural Environment Research Council\u2019s 356 \nLowland Permeable Catchment Research (LOCAR) Programme (http:\/\/catchments.nerc.ac.uk\/). 357 \nJohn Bloomfield publishes with the permission of the Executive Director of the British 358 \nGeological Survey (NERC). 359 \nReferences 360 \nAllen DJ, Brewerton LJ, Coleby LM,Gibbs BR, Lewis MA, MacDonald AM, Wagstaff SJ, 361 \nWilliams AT. 1997.
