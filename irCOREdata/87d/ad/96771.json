Although systematic analysis has given us\ndetailed information on how this enzyme with\n12 conserved subunits initiates, elongates, and\nterminates on naked DNA templates in vitro\n(Lee & Young 2000, Woychik & Hampsey 2002,\nShilatifard et al. 2003, Asturias 2004), little\nis yet known about how it transcribes natural\ntemplates in vivo. In order to study polymerase\ndynamics in living cells, we developed a cell line\nthat expresses the largest (catalytic) subunit,\nRPB1, tagged with the green fluorescent protein\n(GFP). This autofluorescent protein is widely\nused to tag proteins so they can be localized\neasily (Tsien 1998). Application of techniques\nlike FRAP (fluorescent recovery after photo-\nbleaching) and FLIP (fluorescence loss in photo-\nbleaching) then allows measurement of diffusion\nChromosome Research 13: 135\u2013144, 2005. 135\n# 2005 Springer. Printed in the Netherlands\ncoefficients, rates of exchange of the tagged pro-\ntein between different cellular compartments, and\nthe proportions of mobile and immobile fractions\n(Houtsmuller & Vermeulen 2001, Lippincott-\nSchwartz et al. 2001, Phair & Misteli 2001). For\nexample, we and others have used these techni-\nques to analyse the kinetics of RNA poly-\nmerases I and II in vivo (Becker et al. 2002,\nDundr et al. 2002, Kimura et al. 2002).\nOur cell line, C23, is derived from tsTM4, a tem-\nperature-sensitive mutant of the Chinese hamster\novary cell, CHO-K1. The mutation in tsTM4,\nwhich grows at 34\u0001C but not at 39\u0001C, has been\nmapped to RPB1 (Tsuji et al. 1990, Sugaya et al.\n1997). The gene encoding wild-type human RPB1\nwas fused with another encoding GFP, and the\nconstruct expressed in tsTM4; the resulting GFP-\ntagged polymerase (GFP-pol) complemented the\ndefect at the restrictive temperature (39\u0001C), and so\nenabled normal growth (Sugaya et al. 2000). This\nindicates the tagged polymerase is functional at\n39\u0001C, as C23 cells depend on it for survival. How-\never, C23 also contains the original temperature-\nsensitive (endogenous) enzyme that is used in\nconjunction with the GFP-pol at 34\u0001C.\nWe went on to analyse the kinetics of the tagged\npolymerase in living C23 cells using both FRAP\nand FLIP (Kimura et al. 2002). We expected\nto \u00a2nd at least three fractions ^ a large pool of\nenzyme able to di\u00a1use freely, a small fraction\nincorporated into the pre-initiation complex, and a\nthird that was elongating and so temporarily\nimmobilized on the template; the second fraction\nwould probably be bound only temporarily, while\nthe third would be bound for the time taken to\nmake a transcript and it would be sensitive to inhi-\nbitors of transcriptional elongation. However,\nFRAP data could be \u00a2tted assuming there were\nonly two kinetic fractions, with *75% moving\nrapidly and *25% being transiently immobile\n(association t1\/2 *20min). FLIP data were also\nconsistent with the existence of two populations\nbut were not analysed in detail, as the time\nbetween successive bleaches was too short to per-\nmit equilibration. Therefore, we concluded parsi-\nmoniously that the rapidly moving and transiently\nimmobile populations were freely di\u00a1using and\nengaged fractions, respectively. Identi\u00a2cation\nof the transiently immobile fraction as the eng-\naged one was supported by the \u00a2nding that\n5,6-dichloro-1-b-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole\n(DRB) ^ a transcriptional inhibitor that blocks the\ntransition from initiation to elongation (Chodosh\net al. 1989, Marshall & Price 1992, Yamaguchi et\nal. 1998) ^ reduced its size. Moreover, the half-life\nof the elongating fraction in wild-type cells ^\nwhich could be measured by labelling with [3H]uri-\ndine ^ was *14min and so roughly similar to that\nof the transiently immobile fraction.\nWe have now used FLIP to re-examine the kinet-\nics of the GFP-pol in C23 cells. As before, we\nconcentrate on changes occurring over the minutes\nrequired to complete a transcription cycle (i.e.\nincluding initiation, elongation, termination).\n[Determining whether GFP-pol di\u00a1uses as a core\nenzyme of *500 kDa or larger complex of 1000^\n2000kDa (Lee & Young, 2000) requires analysis\nover fractions of a second and the development of\n\u00a3uorescent standards of appropriate size.] Results\nare consistent with the existence of three (or more)\npopulations: a large \u2018free\u2019 (rapidly-di\u00a1using) one, a\nsmall fraction resistant toDRB but sensitive to a dif-\nferent inhibitor of transcription (i.e. heat shock), and\nthe \u2018engaged\u2019 fractionsensitive toboth inhibitors.\nMaterials and methods\nCell culture\nC23 cells, a clonal derivative of tsTM4 cells expre-\nssing the largest subunit of polymerase II (RPB1)\ntagged with GFP under the control of the cyto-\nmegalovirus promoter (Sugaya et al. 2000), were\ngrown at 39\u0001C in Ham\u2019s F-12 medium (Invitrogen\nLtd, Paisley, UK) plus 10% fetal calf serum.\nFLIP\nCells were grown in glass-bottomed microwell\ndishes (Mat Tek, MA) for 40\u201348 h to 50% con-\nfluence. The standard FLIP experiment in Figure 1\nwas performed as described by Kimura et al.\n(2002) using a Radiance 2000 confocal micro-\nscope (488-nm-laser line; 25-mW argon laser at\n4% power; 4\u0002 zoom; scan speed 600 lines\/s; det-\nection using LP500 filter and pinhole setting 4;\nimage size 51.5 mm; BioRad Laboratories, Hemel\nHampstead, UK) fitted on a TE300 microscope\n(Nikon UK Limited, Kingston upon Thames,\n136 M. Hieda et al.\nSurrey, UK) and a 60 \u0002 PlanApo objective\n(numerical aperture 1.4). Cells were imaged at\n39\u0001C on the microscope stage. A field with two\ncells was selected, imaged every *0.43 s for 30\nimages, and the bottom half of one nucleus\nbleached with 100% laser power as the field was\nscanned every 0.43 s for another 130 s. The inten-\nsity of the unbleached half of the bleached\nnucleus was measured and normalized relative to\nthe unbleached nucleus (Phair & Misteli 2000).\nThen, the relative intensity is given by:\n\u00bdI\u00f0t\u00de \u0005 B\u00f0t\u00de\u0006=\u00bdKI\u00f0t\u00de \u0005 B\u00f0t\u00de\u0006\n\u00bdI\u00f00\u00de \u0005 B\u00f00\u00de\u0006=\u00bdKI\u00f00\u00de \u0005 B\u00f00\u00de\u0006\nwhere I(t) is the average intensity of the unbleached\nregion of interest at time t, I(0) is the average\nprebleach intensity of the region of interest aver-\naged over *15 s, KI(0) and KI(t) are the average\nnuclear intensities of a neighbouring cell in the\nsame field of view prior to bleaching and at time t,\nrespectively, and B(0) and B(t) are the average back-\nground fluorescence outside cells in the same field\nprior to bleaching and at time t, respectively. The\nalternative procedure (Figure 2, curves 4, 5) used\nthe laser at 2.5% power, 7\u0002 zoom, scan speed 500\nlines\/s, Kalman filter 7, pinhole setting 8, and data\nwas collected every 15 s to allow complete equili-\nbration of mobile proteins. As a result, each experi-\nment involved repeats of 7 imaging\/bleaching\nscans (over 3.58 s) and 11.42 s without illumina-\ntion; the Kalman filter combined the 7 scans into\none to provide images.\nIn some cases, 100mmol\/L 5,6-dichloro-1-b-D-\nribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) was added for\n25min before FLIP, so the total time in DRB until\nthe last image was collected ranged from 25^57min.\nThe extent of transcriptional inhibition by the drug\nwas monitored by immuno\u00a3uorescence. Cells were\ngrown in DRB for 25 or 60min (the minimum and\nmaximum exposures) and \u00a2xed; 2.5mmol\/L Br-U\nwas added 10min prior to \u00a2xation, and the resulting\nBr-RNA indirectly immunolabelled (below). Treat-\nment with DRB for 25 and 60min reduced nucleo-\nplasmic labelling (measured as below using >100\ncells) to 34\u0003 12 and 16\u0003 5% of untreated controls,\nrespectively (not shown). As cells in the FLIP experi-\nment in Figure 2 were analysed in this time interval,\nand as *8% residual activity is due to polymerase\nIII (Pombo et al. 1999), between 74 and 92% poly-\nmerase IIwould be inhibited.\nIn other cases, cells were heat shocked. The glass-\nbottomed microwell dish was surrounded in waxy\n\u00a2lm, immersed in a water bath for 15min at 45\u0001C,\nand incubated on the microscope stage at 45\u0001C for\nup to another 20min during FLIP (total time at\n45\u0001C was always<35min). This treatment also inhi-\nbits most polymerase II activity; thus, in experiments\nlike the one illustrated inFigure 1C, the relative inten-\nsities of nucleoplasmic labelling (average of >30\nnuclei) at the four times were 100, 51\u0003 27, 12\u0003 5,\nand 92\u0003 48, respectively (not shown). As the max-\nimum exposure of cells in the FLIP experiment in\nFigure 2 was 35min, and as*8% residual activity is\ndue to polymerase III (Pombo et al. 1999), all but 4%\npolymerase II would then be inhibited. This value is\nclose to the 92%maximal inhibition seenwithDRB.\nData were analysed using kinetic models\nbased on standard principles of chemical kine-\ntics (Phair & Misteli 2001, Dundr et al. 2002)\nand \u2018BerkeleyMadonna\u2019 (http:\/\/www.berkeleyma\ndonna.com) and \u2018MATLAB\u2019 software (http:\/\/www.\nmathworks.com). However, unconstrained optimi-\nzation of parameters for various 3-population\nordinary di\u00a1erential equation models yielded simi-\nlar least-squares best \u00a2ts (not shown), such that we\nwere unable to discriminate conclusively between\nthem. For example, in one model a \u2018free\u2019 popula-\ntion bound reversibly, and some of the resulting\n\u2018bound\u2019 fraction entered an \u2018engaged\u2019 or \u2018elongat-\ning\u2019 pool that returned to the \u2018free\u2019 pool on termi-\nnation. In another, a \u2018free\u2019 population exchanged\ndirectly with either an \u2018engaged\u2019 fraction or a\n\u2018bound\u2019 one (which could only pass to the\n\u2018engaged\u2019 fraction through the \u2018free\u2019 pool). We\nbelieve that discriminating between such models\nwill require the acquisition of more and better\ndata, and the extension of the models to include\na more detailed description of the binding and\nelongation processes, possibly considering the\nduration of elongation in terms of delay di\u00a1er-\nential equations.\nBr-U incorporation\nCells were grown on coverslips in 35-mm dishes\nfor 48 h.

All immu-\nnoblotting procedures were conducted at room\ntemperature unless stated otherwise.

Curve\n3: cells heat-shocked at 45\tC for 25\u201335min before and 130 s\nduring bleaching. Inset: The kinetics of curve 1 are consistent\nwith there being two (or more) populations that enter the\nbleaching zone with different kinetics: here, three are shown.\nOne (\u2018free\u2019) diffuses rapidly, the second (\u2018bound\u2019) is attached\ntemporarily to some nuclear structure but is transcriptionally\ninactive, while the third (\u2018engaged\u2019) dissociates slowly from the\ntemplate. DRB would release the \u2018engaged\u2019 fraction to increase\nthe size of the \u2018free\u2019 fraction, and heat shock would release\nboth \u2018bound\u2019 and \u2018engaged\u2019 fractions.

Bar: 10mm.\n138 M. Hieda et al.\nselected, and raster scanned repeatedly with the\nlaser as images were collected on a confocal\nmicroscope (Figure 1A). The laser power was\nvaried during scanning. A low power sufficient\nfor imaging was used for most of each scan, but\nthen the power was increased 25\u0002 for bleaching\nas the laser scanned through a rectangle contain-\ning the bottom half of the lower nucleus. Unfor-\ntunately, the power fluctuations degrade the\nimage to the right of the rectangle. This process\nwas repeated every *0.43 s for 120 s until most\nfluorescence disappeared from the top half of the\nbottom nucleus. The intensity in the unbleached\nhalf of the nucleus was then expressed relative\nto its original (unbleached) intensity, and the value\nfurther corrected for the slight effects of bleaching\nduring imaging (using the reduction in fluor-\nescence seen in the other unbleached nucleus).\nWe can envisage several di\u00a1erent results of such\nbleaching. If all GFP-pol were freely di\u00a1usible,\nbleaching the bottom half should progressively\nreduce the (relative) intensity in the top half to\nzero because unbleached molecules can di\u00a1use into\nthe target area and be bleached; this is the result\nobtained in control cells expressing GFP (Kimura\net al. 2002). At the other extreme, all GFP-pol\nmight be immobile, and then the relative intensity\nremains at unity because immobile molecules in\nthe top half can never enter the bleaching zone;\nthis is the result obtained with \u00a2xed cells (Kimura\net al. 2002). The results lie between these extremes,\nand are consistent with the existence of two (or\nmore) populations. The larger population would\nbe able to di\u00a1use rapidly into the bleaching zone,\nwhile the smaller one leaves the top half of the\nnucleus more slowly (Figure 1B, curve 1). The \u00a2rst\nof these two populations would be equivalent to\nthe one labelled \u2018free\u2019 in the inset in Figure 1B,\nwhile the second would contain both the \u2018bound\u2019\nand \u2018engaged\u2019 populations. [These terms are used\noperationally. Thus, the \u2018free\u2019 population includes\nmolecules able to translocate rapidly between the\ntwo halves of the nucleus. They may bind to ^ and\ndissociate rapidly from ^ chromatin and\/or other\nnuclear structures as they do so, and they may also\nbe part of a large di\u00a1using complex. The \u2018bound\u2019\nfraction may include molecules attached tempora-\nrily to DNA (perhaps in a pre-initiation complex\nor \u2018sca\u00a1old\u2019; Yudkovsky et al. 2000) or some other\nnuclear substructure (perhaps in some store).]\nKimura et al. (2002) suggest the second popula-\ntion is mainly composed of the engaged fraction\n(which would include both \u2018elongating\u2019 and \u2018paused\u2019\nternary complexes), and this was supported by\nan additional experiment using the inhibitor of\nFigure 2. GFP-pol kinetics analysed using an alternative FLIP\nprocedure. The procedure was as in Figure 1A&B except that\na 25.7-fold higher laser power was used and imaging\/bleaching\ntook place 37.5-fold less frequently (i.e. every 15 s).

The kinetics underlying\ncurves 4 and 5 are consistent with the existence of at least 3\nand 2 populations indicated by the straight lines, respectively.\nRNA polymerase II in living cells 139\ntranscriptional elongation, DRB (Chodosh et al.\n1989, Marshall et al. 1992, Yamaguchi et al.\n1998). This drug inhibits P-TEFb kinase and so\nhyper phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal\ndomain (CTD) of RPB1; such hyperpho-\nsphorylation is characteristic of the active elongat-\ning enzyme. We also repeated these experiments\nusing exposures of <60min to minimize side\ne\u00a1ects. As the drug progressively inhibits more\nand more transcription during the experiment, we\nmonitored the extent of inhibition at di\u00a1erent\ntimes; the shortest DRB treatment used reduced\ntranscription by polymerase II to *26% of\nuntreated controls, and the longest to *8%\n(Materials and methods). Such treatments with\nDRB ensured the relative intensity fell further\n(Figure 1B, curve 2; see also Kimura et al. 2002);\npresumably, any \u2018bound\u2019 and\/or \u2018engaged\u2019 poly-\nmerases become soluble and so part of the freely-\ndi\u00a1using fraction.\nThe simplest explanation of all these results is\nthat there are two kinetic fractions, one \u2018free\u2019 and\nthe other DRB-sensitive and \u2018engaged\u2019. As curve 2\nin Figure 1B does not decay to zero (at least in the\ntime analysed), it could be assumed that DRB\ndoes not inhibit all transcription by polymerase II\n(as is the case) and\/or some polymerase remains\nengaged on very long transcription units. How-\never, results are also consistent with other more\ncomplicated interpretations, including the possibi-\nlity that a third DRB-insensitive fraction exists\n(labelled \u2018bound\u2019 in Figure 1B, inset). We now pre-\nsent data consistent with this more complicated\ninterpretation using a di\u00a1erent inhibitor, and an\nalternative FLIP procedure.\nHeat shock destabilizes most polymerase\nGrowth at 45\u0001C inhibits transcription (Lindquist\n1986, Lis & Wu 1993). As photobleaching experi-\nments necessarily extend over a period of time\n(in our case 25\u201337min) during which the heat\nshock progressively inhibits more and more tran-\nscription, we chose a protocol that inhibited\ntranscription to roughly the same extent as DRB\nso results could be compared. The longest expo-\nsures to DRB and 45\u0001C reduce transcription by\npolymerase II (measured by immunofluorescence\nafter a brief pulse of Br-U) to *8 and 4% of\nuntreated controls, respectively (Figure 1C;\nMaterials and methods). After the thermal shock\nbefore and during FLIP, the relative intensity in\nthe unbleached area fell almost to zero (Figure\n1B, curve 3). This provides formal proof that\nheat shock leads to essentially the complete dis-\nengagement of the polymerase from the template\nso it becomes freely diffusible. The effects of this\nheat treatment were reversible, as the transcrip-\ntion rate recovers to *92% of untreated controls\nafter growth at the normal temperature for 4.5 h\n(Figure 1C; Materials and methods).\nDRB and heat shock inhibit RNA polymerase\nII in di\u00a1erent ways; the e\u00a1ects on the relative inten-\nsity are also di\u00a1erent (Figure 1B, compare curves 2\nand 3). This di\u00a1erence suggests there might be at\nleast three kinetic fractions (Figure 1B, inset) ^ (1)\n\u2018free\u2019 (di\u00a1usible), (2) \u2018bound\u2019 (sensitive to heat\nshock but not DRB), and (3) \u2018engaged\u2019 (sensitive\nto both heat shock and DRB). Then, DRB would\nrelease only the \u2018engaged\u2019 fraction, while heat\nshock would release both \u2018bound\u2019 and \u2018engaged\u2019\nfractions.\nAn alternative FLIP procedure reveals multiple\nkinetic fractions\nKimura et al. (2002) did not analyse curves like\nthose in Figure 1 in detail because the interval\nbetween successive bleaches was too short to\nallow equilibration of the mobile fraction\nthroughout the nucleus. Therefore, we lengthened\n38-fold the interval between bleaches (i.e. from\n0.43 to 15 s) to allow more time for this fraction\nto equilibrate. We also increased the bleaching\npower 26-fold to compensate in part for the less-\nfrequent bleaching, and extended the duration of\nthe experiment ten-fold (i.e. to >20min). This\n\u2018alternative\u2019 FLIP procedure yields curve 4 in\nFigure 2A,B. Comparison of the original and\n\u2018alternative\u2019 procedures (curves 1 and 4 in Figure\n2A) shows that the relative intensity given by the\n\u2018alternative\u2019 initially falls less rapidly; this is expec-\nted as the accumulated laser power used for\nbleaching is less. However, the two curves con-\nverge once the mobile GFP-pol is bleached. As\nessentially all the \u2018free\u2019 fraction is eliminated using\nthe \u2018alternative\u2019 procedure by about 2min, analy-\nsis of the kinetics of the other fraction(s) is\nfacilitated. After bleaching for 20min, the relative\nintensity falls to 5% (Figure 2B, curve 4). As\n140 M. Hieda et al.\nbefore, pretreatment with DRB ensured the rela-\ntive intensity fell further and more rapidly (Figure\n2B, curve 5); presumably, most \u2018engaged\u2019 poly-\nmerases become soluble and so part of the freely-\ndiffusing fraction.\nIf there were three populations in untreated cells\nthat exchanged with very di\u00a1erent kinetics (i.e.\n\u2018free\u2019, \u2018bound\u2019, and \u2018engaged\u2019), we might expect to\n\u00a2t a semilogarithmic plot of the data in curve 4\n(Figure 2) with three straight lines (as in Figure\n2C, curve 4); and ^ if DRB-treatment eliminated\none of these populations ^ we would expect to \u00a2t\nthe data with only two (as in Figure 2C, curve 5).\nHowever, \u00a2ts, though adequate, were imperfect.\nNevertheless, results are consistent with the idea\nthat there are (at least) three populations, with one\nbeing insensitive to DRB but sensitive to heat\nshock.\nNumbers of molecules in the different fractions\nWe next correlated the number of molecules of the\ndifferent forms of the polymerase in the cell with the\nrelative sizes of the different kinetic fractions. Mole-\ncular numbers were determined by quantitative\nimmunoblotting (Kimura et al. 1999) using an anti-\nbody that recognizes the hyper- and hypophos-\nphorylated forms of the C-terminal domain (CTD)\nof RPB1 (i.e. IIO and IIA; Besse et al. 1995). HeLa\nand the parental CHO-K1 cells contain IIO and IIA,\nwhile C23 also contains hypo- and hyperphos-\nphorylated GFP-pol (i.e. GFP-pol IIA and GFP-pol\nIIO). When C23 is grown at 39\n\u0001C, it contains little\nendogenous and temperature-sensitive IIO (Figure 3).\nWe then related the fractions of the different forms\nto the known numbers of the polymerase in an\nequivalent number of HeLa cells (Figure 3; Table I).\nFigure 3. The numbers of molecules of the largest (catalytic) subunit of RNA polymerase II in HeLa, C23, and CHO-K1 cells\ndetermined by quantitative immunoblotting. Proteins from 3\n 104 cells (lanes 1, 7), and doubling dilutions (lanes 2\u20136, 8\u201312) were\nresolved on a gel, and the largest subunit detected by immunoblotting using the 7C2 antibody that recognizes both hyper- (IIO) and\nhypo- (IIA) phosphorylated forms of the CTD.\nTable I. The numbers of the different forms of the largest (catalytic) subunit of RNA polymerase II.\nHeLa C23 CHO-K1\nTotal 320000 480000 192000\nIIO 170000\na <3000 96000\nGFP-IIO 100000\nIIA 150000\na 130000 96000\nGFP-IIA 250000\nNumbers were obtained by quantitative immunoblotting using images like that in Figure 3 (average of 3 experiments), assuming there are\n320000 molecules in a HeLa cell (Kimura et al. 1999). HeLa and CHO-K1 were grown at 37\tC, while C23 was grown at 39\tC. a: similar\nresults were obtained by Jackson et al. (1998).\nRNA polymerase II in living cells 141\nAlthough C23 contains more than twice the total\nnumber of molecules as the parental CHO-K1, num-\nbers of the hyperphosphorylated form are similar\n(compare GFP-IIO in C23 to IIO in CHO-K1 in\nTable I). This is to be expected: CHO-K1 and C23\nhave similar sizes and grow at similar rates (Sugaya\net al. 2000), and it is mainly these forms that are\nactive (Dahmus 1996, Buratowski 2003). Con-\nversely, the (inactive) hypophosphorylated form\nconstitutes *71% of the total GFP-pol (Table I)\ncompared with the *75% GFP-pol that constitutes\nthe rapidly exchanging (\u2018free\u2019) fraction determined\nby FRAP (Kimura et al. 2002). As expected, then,\nthe \u2018free\u2019 population is hypophosphorylated and\ninactive.\nDiscussion\nOne question arises in any study involving GFP\ntagging: to what extent does the tagged protein\nbehave like its natural counterpart? The best way\nof ensuring normal function is to replace the\nendogenous gene with a hybrid gene encoding\nthe tagged protein, and show that the resulting\ncells grow normally; this is rarely done in mam-\nmalian cells as precise gene replacement is so dif-\nficult. An alternative is to utilize a mutant, and\ndemonstrate by genetic complementation that the\nhybrid gene can restore normal function; this is\nalso rarely done as there are so few mutants. As\na result, most studies utilize \u2018transient\u2019 transfec-\ntions that give populations of variably expressing\ncells and then it is difficult to prove that the tag-\nged protein functions normally. Here, we used a\nclonal line expressing the largest (catalytic) sub-\nunit of RNA polymerase II (i.e. RPB1) tagged\nwith GFP in addition to the exogenous genes,\nbut this leads to overexpression (Figure 3; Table\nI). However, we did demonstrate complementa-\ntion using the appropriate (temperature-sensitive)\nmutant, so it must be the tagged molecule that\nkeeps this clone alive (Sugaya et al. 2000). More-\nover, a significant fraction of the GFP-pol (but\nlittle of its endogenous temperature-sensitive\ncounterpart) is hyperphosphorylated (Figure 3)\nand resistant to sarkosyl (Kimura et al. 2002),\ntwo characteristics of the active enzyme (Dahmus\n1996, Buratowski 2003). Even so, the diffusional\ndynamics of the GFP-tagged protein must differ\nfrom the endogenous protein, as it is inevitably\n28 kDa larger \u2013 the size of the GFP tag. For this\nand other reasons (Introduction), we concentrate\nhere on changes occurring over the minutes\nrequired to complete a transcription cycle (i.e.\nincluding initiation, elongation and termination)\nand not on the changes occurring at shorter\ntimes where diffusional kinetics dominate.\nOur results con\u00a2rm and extend those of Kimura\net al. (2002) and Becker et al. (2002). The former\nexpected to \u00a2nd at least three kinetic fractions of\nGFP-pol: a large pool of enzyme able to di\u00a1use\nfreely, a small fraction incorporated into the pre-\ninitiation complex, and a third that was elongating\nand so temporarily immobilized on the template.\nHowever, data could be \u00a2tted assuming there were\nonly two, with *75% moving rapidly and *25%\nbeing transiently immobile; they concluded parsi-\nmoniously that the former was freely di\u00a1using,\nand the latter was elongating as it could be\nreleased with DRB. We now use a di\u00a1erent inhi-\nbitor ^ a brief thermal shock (Lindquist 1986, Lis\n& Wu 1993) ^ and \u00a2nd that it has a di\u00a1erent e\u00a1ect\nfrom DRB (even though conditions were chosen\nso that it inhibits transcription to the same extent).\nHeat shock leads to almost complete disengage-\nment of the polymerase (Figure 1B, compare\ncurves 1 and 3), formally con\u00a2rming results\nobtained less directly (e.g. Gilmour & Lis 1985).\n[We assume DRB and heat shock decrease the\nengaged fraction by inhibiting early steps in the\ntranscription cycle, rather than speeding up later\nsteps like elongation and termination.] Data were\nconsistent with there being at least three kinetic\nfractions ^ the rapidly-di\u00a1using (\u2018free\u2019) one, plus a\nsecond sensitive to heat shock but not DRB, and a\nthird sensitive to both heat shock and DRB\n(Figure 1B). Use of an alternative FLIP procedure\nalso revealed multiple kinetic fractions (Figure 2C).\nHow do these fractions relate to those known to\nbiochemists? The largest fraction is clearly inac-\ntive; it exchanges rapidly (and so cannot be\nengaged), and FRAP shows that it constitutes\n*75% of the total (Kimura et al. 2002) which com-\npares with the*71% found as GFP-IIA by quanti-\ntative immunoblotting (Table I). [Most of form\nIIA is known to be inactive (Dahmus 1996).] Unfor-\ntunately, it is di\u2044cult to be sure about the other\ntwo fractions, which are de\u00a2ned through the\naction of such unspeci\u00a2c inhibitors, DRB and heat\n142 M. Hieda et al.\nshock. Nevertheless, one simple interpretation is\nthat one, which is DRB-insensitive but heat-shock\nsensitive, is bound but not engaged, while the\nother, which is sensitive to both DRB and heat\nshock, is elongating.\nIn order to gain more insight into the transcrip-\ntion cycle and amount of polymerase in the di\u00a1er-\nent fractions, data were analysed using models\nbased on the principles of chemical kinetics (Mate-\nrials and methods). Unfortunately, di\u00a1erent mod-\nels yielded kinetics that, using best-\u00a2t values of the\nmodel parameters, were consistent with much of\nour data, and it was di\u2044cult to discriminate\nbetween them. We believe that suitable models will\nnecessarily have to be more complicated, and so\nwill require more and better data than we have at\npresent to enable us to discriminate between them.\nThese models will probably initially have to\ninclude many di\u00a1erent populations, so that we can\ninvestigate whether some can be eliminated. These\npopulations include those that are exchanging with\nthe cytoplasm, freely-di\u00a1using throughout nuclei,\nbound transiently but non-productively (e.g. to\nchromatin or inactive stores; Carrero et al. 2003),\nbound at promoters, contained in pre-initiation\ncomplexes, elongating, paused (Law et al. 1998),\nand terminating. They may also have to involve\ndelay di\u00a1erential equations to account for the dura-\ntion of elongation, possibly with a suitable distribu-\ntion of delay times to re\u00a3ect the widely di\u00a1ering\nlengths of transcription units found in mammalian\ngenomes.\nPrevious results using \u00a2xed cells have demon-\nstrated that nascent transcripts are concentrated\nin discrete nucleoplasmic sites or \u2018factories\u2019 (Cook\n1999). Why, then, are these factories not visible in\nimages like those in Figure 1A, especially when\nmost of the obscuring pool of free polymerases\nhas been removed by photobleaching? There are\nprobably two interrelated reasons. First, a typical\nfactory contains only *8 active polymerase mole-\ncules, and it is di\u2044cult to image so few GFP\nmolecules in a living cell. Second, the confocal\nmicroscope has a resolution (at best) of *700 nm\nin the z axis. Although individual factories\nare seen in cryosections of *100 nm, they are too\nnumerous to be resolved in sections of *700 nm.\nTherefore, imaging factories in living cells\nawaits technical improvements in sensitivity and\nresolution.\nAcknowledgements\nM.H. is a Research Fellow of the Japanese\nSociety for the Promotion of Science.
