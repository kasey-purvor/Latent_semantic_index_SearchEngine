Networks are described by  a \"mean value\" of relationships \nbetween pairs within the network. Quantitative indicators, obtained through monovariate and \nmultivariate statistical methods, allow comparing the situation before and after the programme, and \ntherefore yield clues for programme impact assessment. An attempt to visualize network evolution \nwith multivariate analysis is presented. \n \n1. Nature of the problem \n \nCooperation between research laboratories is an important part of scientific activity. It is supposed to \nbe an added value of large research programmes, since the incited links might yield further \ncooperation after those programmes end. Also, it enhances the cohesion of the scientific community \nand eases the flow of knowledge and research personnel.  \nEC Science and Stimulation programmes were set up within the EC Framework programme to \nstimulate cooperation and collaboration between European research laboratories in the fields of exact \nsciences. Support from the SCIENCE Plan can be given for up to three years to the research teams \nfor travel, staff, computing equipment and meetings plus an extra 20 % for overheads. Individual \nfellowships for travel and living expenditures in another country have also been awarded in \nconsiderable number. \nOne of the hopes is that these programmes help building EC research networks, and this criterion \nwas submitted to an assessment for the evaluation of the programmes. But no method was available \nfor it, and the very concept of scientific cooperative network remained fuzzy. This paper describes by \nwhich methods this assessment was made  \n \n                                                     \n1 Research director, Cr\u00e9doc (Centre de Recherche pour l'Etude et l'Observation des Conditions de vie. 140, rue \ndu Chevaleret, 75013 Paris, France).  \nThis paper is made after a survey realized for the Evaluation Panel (CEC, DG XII) of Science and Stimulation \nProgrammes, by  SHS Consultants and the Cr\u00e9doc. For further questions and detailed description of the \nmethodology,  full report (\"EEC Science & Stimulation programmes. Evaluation survey : methodology, operations \n& data analysis. Cr\u00e9doc, SHS Consultants, Feb. 1990\") can be consulted through EC DG XII. \n \n \n2 \nThe situation  \n183 contracts, involving 629  labs in 12 EC countries, were to be analyzed. Each contract involved \nfrom 2 to 29 labs working together on the same project (funded by the programme), including one \n\"coordinator\", more specifically in charge of contract coordination and communication with DG XII. \n \ncontract X\nlab\ncontract Y contract Z\ncontract T contract W\nETC..\nlab\nlab\nlabcoordinator \nlab lab\nlab\nlab lab\nlab\nlab\nlab\nlab lab\nlab\nlab\nlab lab\nlab\ncoordinator \nlab\ncoordinator \nlab\ncoordinator \nlab\ncoordinator \nlab\n \n \nThe Commission wanted to describe, along parameters relevant to the objectives to the programmes, \nthe effects on the participating labs. As in particular one such parameter, the network effect, was still \nonly vaguely defined our objective became to answer the questions : \n- What changes were brought about in the relationships between the labs in relation to the objectives \nof the programme ? \n- What content does the notion of networks among research labs really have ? \nWe are therefore facing a more general problem of the birth of networks through external incentive, \nnot only from a pure scientific interest, but also from the pragmatic point of view of a structure (the \ncommission) wanting to enhance the networking effects. This brought constraints on the quantitative \nevaluation : time (roughly 3 months altogether), and lightness of the questionnaire (2 pages \nmaximum), since labs often complain about the burden of filling administrative forms. \n \n1.1. Method \n \n1.1.1. Defining  networks \n \nAlthough much work has been done with networks involving only one type of relation (mainly in \nphysical networks with fluid-like transfers between knots, e.g., water supply, electrical or telephonic \nnetworks), few theoretical or practical methodologies concerning the quantitative analysis of networks \nwith differentiated qualitative fluxes were known to us at the time. Considering theoretical investment \nin graph theory was hazardous in the schedule given, since we could not guarantee finding an \nefficient algorithm appropriate for non-connex graphs such as the ones involved, we chose a statistic \napproach, including multivariate analysis techniques, appropriate for all-range data exploration. This \n \n3 \nexplains why this paper is pragmatically oriented, and has no bibliography. \n \nWe chose to consider the set of labs involved in each contract as a potential local network, \nindependent of the rest of the labs in the world. This is, naturally, a strong hypothesis, but the amount \nof data that could be collected in reasonable time allows no more2. The idea is to assess the effect of \nSSP on these local networks, by comparing the level of their collaboration before the contract and \nafter. The first step is then to build up two matrixes of relationships between labs, one before contract, \nand one after, and then to assess the impact of the contract on the first matrix (relations previous the \ncontract) by comparing it to the second. \n \nConsidering the difficulty of obtaining summed-up information on relationships within local networks, \nthe first option was to focus on bilateral relationships between the labs involved in each contract, and \nto sum up this information in some way to get global information on each contract. To make this \noption more clear, let us consider one contract, X, involving labs A, B, C, and D ; A being the \ncoordinator. This contract involves 6 couples of labs : {A, B}, {A, C} {A, D}, {B, C} , {B, D}, and {C, D}. \n \nIn the ideal case, suppose we have a mean of describing the nature of the relationships in a couple, \nthat we call, for the moment, \"value\", without more precision. To get first-hand information on all these \ncouples, we must contact at least 3 labs among the 4 involved. Considering that all labs may not \nanswer, it is more secure to contact all 4 labs. We will then get, supposing all labs answer, information \non each of the 12 pairs (that is : ordered couples, where (A, B) is distinct from (B, A)). E.g. : for pair \n(A, B) the answer of A about its relationship with B, (A, B) ; and the answer of B about the same \nrelationship : (B, A). This is valuable in the sense that we can compare those (subjective) data, and, if \nthey differ, compute a \"mean\" value on relationship {A, B}.  It is then possible to compute a synthetic \nvalue of contract X, for example the mean value of all the pair values on which we have information.  \n \nWe would then have a data file consisting of a list of contracts, each with a measure of the mean level \nof relationship between the labs involved. Each contract is then assimilated to a local network. \nAssessment of the effect of the programme can then be based on the comparison between the level \nof relationship before the contract and after. \n \n1.1.2. Measuring relationships \n \nLet us now come to the \"value\" of relationships. It is difficult to measure its intensity, since \nrelationships can take many forms, and that we cannot bluntly assume that there is a linear gradation \nof relationships, from \"no contact at all\" to \"permanent and all-range collaboration\". It may be that \ndifferent types of networks exist, each with a specific combination of relationships, and that those \nideal types would work as \"attractors\" in the mathematical sense of the term. Common observation of \n                                                     \n2Proper  network evaluation would need to get information, from each lab in the world,  with all the other labs in \nthe world. Our method is therefore applicable only when the network boundaries are defined.  \n \n4 \nlab networks shows that there are some with weak but regular relationships, like durable interpersonal \ncontacts, with casual co-publication, some with intense and permanent links, including sharing \nresearch funds on most projects, some with episodic but intense collaboration, etc. We disposed of no \n\"models\" of such networks, and the first thing was to assess them empirically. So, we decided to \ncharacterize the state of relationships between pairs of labs by  checking the existence of various \ntypes of relationship. We started with a dozen interviews of researchers to make a list of the existing \nmodalities that the relationships could take, and we came up with the following list of 9, \"no contact\" \nand 8 types of relationships : \n \n\"0\" = no contact, or just reading each others' publications \n\"1\" = some casual contacts (mail, telephone, meetings in congresses or open seminars only) \n\"2\" = personal contacts between some of your scientists and theirs, including short visits \n\"3\" = exchange, buying or communication of research material (raw data, samples, measurement apparatus...)  \n\"4\" = exchange of scientists, or stays of a scientist in the other lab for longer than a week, for the purpose of \ntraining, specialization, or technology transfer. \n\"5\" = co-authored publications (in reviews or conferences, symposia, etc.) \n\"6\" = regular meetings or closed seminars between labs  \n\"7\" = close relations : permanent exchange or collaboration on several projects (joint experiments, etc.) \n\"8\" = sharing funds on research contracts \n \nThose modalities are just a fast choice of what seemed to be the most frequent types of contacts. Ex-\npost analysis of more than 400  \"open\" answers of the labs let us think that this choice was, if not \nperfect, at least acceptable.  Still, it seems that item 3 was not always correctly understood : control \nshowed that some labs only included in this item the exchange of ponderous material, forgetting raw \ndata. \n \n1.1.3. Assessment criteria \n \nOne important difficulty is : what is success ? Measuring the effects of a programme only implies \ntechnical difficulties, but assessing success cannot be done unless success criteria have been \ndefined independently of effect measurement.  This should  be, in our point of view, one of the bases \nof evaluation methodology. Still, practice shows how difficult it is for new projects : one can define \npertinent success criteria only when one has a precise idea of the precise effects of a programme, \nand experience of what effects are indeed positive. For one thing, unforecasted boomerang effects \ncan only be assessed afterwards. SSP was such a new programme, and, therefore, we were not \ngiven success criteria by the commission, except that \"enhanced network activity\" was desired.  \n \nThe criterion that we have taken is the \"volume\" of relations. We assume that, the more relations \nthere are, the more network effect there is. Should this hypothesis be wrong, one can still use the \nresults as we mainly observed the changes in relationships pattern before and after contract. Only in \n \n5 \nour conclusions do we use this interpretation rule : \"more relationships is better\". \n \nTo sum up our methodological options, our theoretical choices were the following : \n- to analyze each set of laboratories involved in a contract as a small, independent, network ; \n- to analyze the nature of relationships within these local networks through relationships between \npairs of labs ; \n- to build an appropriate checklist to characterize the nature of relationships within pairs ; \n- to compare the state \"before contract\" and \"after\", in order to assess programme impact ; \n- to explain this impact through the nature of local networks, and the attitude of labs towards the \nprogramme. \n \nTechnically, we chose : \n- to use a statistical analysis, sustained and validated by qualitative approach ; \n- to use \"light-and-fast\" methods in data collecting, in order to avoid labs the \"paper-filling syndrome\"; \n- to use the Commission flexible data base to personalize all questionnaires. This relational data base \ncontains information on all the contracts, obtained through the application forms, and permitted not to \nask again too much information during the survey.  \n2. Survey and basic results \n \nThe survey was made on all labs involved in ongoing contracts (pr. October 1989) of the \nSCIENCE\/STIMULATION Programme. \n \nThe questionnaire was tested by telephone on a couple of labs, and sent to the whole sample. The \nquestionnaire is written in English, and has a standard shape. The second page (Q2, Q3, Q4) is the \nsame for all the labs, but the beginning of the questionnaire, concerning contract specifications, and \nQ1 (relationships between labs), is personalized for each respondent. Questionnaires were generated \nfrom the flexible data base of the Evaluation Division  \n \n \nICI INSERER UN FAC SIMILE DU QUESTIONNAIRE, SUR UNE DEMI-PAGE. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPersonalization of the questionnaires certainly was a main reason for the good return rate and the \nquality of the data obtained. Also, several variables3 from the data base were by this mean introduced \nin the questionnaire before it was sent to the respondents : \n \n contract number (including type : stimulation or science), \n number of labs in the contract, \n identification of respondent, \n nature of respondent (coordinator or simple partner), \n Discipline (physics, maths, etc.), \n nature of contract (operation or twinning), \n identification of each lab by its EC data base code, country of each lab.  \n \nThis enables respondents to answer the questionnaire in a few minutes without having to look in their \nown contract files, and helps them remember who are their partners, if necessary. \n \nThe questionnaire seemed short to the eye, through some \"easy tricks\". The numbering of questions \ngoes from 1 to 4. In fact, there are 16 closed questions, 1 open question, and from 2 to 58 questions4 \nconcerning the relationships between labs, before and after contract. These relationships are non-\nexclusive, which means that two labs can, for instance, exchange research material (item 3) and\/or  \nscientists (item 4). This yields 257 possible types of relationships between pairs5. The labs gave more \nprecise information than what a quick look at the questions reveals, since we asked this information \nfor the state of relationships before and after contract. In fact, we can, in theory, position the lab pairs \nin a matrix of 257x257 possibilities for contract impact, that is 66 049  modalities. \n \nAlso, automatic generation of the questionnaire fortunately left a large empty space in the first page \nfor most of the questionnaires, since space had to be planned for the few contracts involving many \nlabs. This makes the questionnaire look even shorter. \n \n                                                     \n3The amount of the contract was not included in the questionnaire, but it was also extracted from the data base, \nand used in data processing. \n \n4 depending on the number of labs involved in the contract. \n5 That is (28 + 1) combinations, considering that item 0 (\"no contact\") is not compatible with any of the other 8 \nitems. \n \n7 \n2.3. Mailing and return rates \n \nThe questionnaire was mailed to the 629 labs. It was fully personalized, and mailed with a personal \nletter. The respondents were told to send back the questionnaire in a delay of 15 days. After 21 days, \nall the coordinators who had not answered were phoned, and a personalized questionnaire was faxed \nto them, when the original had been lost.  \nSpontaneous return rate was good, and rather fast : 35% three weeks after the first mailing. \n \nFinal \"usable\"6 return rates are :  \n \n respondents labs involved return rate \ncoordinators 155 181 86% \npartners 270 418 65% \nTotal 425 599 71% \n \nIf we now consider response rate by contract, as we could compute 179 contracts out of the 181 that \nwere finally  kept , response rate is 99%. This good return rate is due to several factors.  \n \n- labs had received money from the EC, and thus were \"interested\" clients ; \n- most of the contracts were still running ; \n- excellent appreciation of the programme by the participants, as can be seen through enthusiastic \nappreciation in the open question, and often in the accompanying letter sent back by the labs with \ntheir questionnaires ; \n- personalization of the letter  and questionnaire ; \n-  \"light-and-fastness\" of the questionnaire, which average length was 1,5 page ; \n \nThese factors should be taken into account in further applications of the method : users might expect \nlower response rate if they do not have such positive incentives. \nCountry of origin significantly affects on response rate, but not the discipline of labs. Response rate \nwas better in contracts involving few labs, although it is difficult to link this effect with the intensity of \nrelationship within the networks. \n \n2.4. Data analysis \n \nAfter the questionnaires were received, they were checked, numbered, transferred onto magnetic \nsupport and analyzed. \n \n                                                     \n6 In fine, about 20 questionnaires were received and not processed, wether they arrived too late or were not filled \nup correctly. Those figures are computed on the 181 contracts that were finally kept in the sample, after \nelimination of 2 atypical contracts. Coordinators are counted here as such only in the one contract were they are \nso, even if they are involved in several contracts in SSP. \n \n8 \n2.4.1. Pairs of labs \n \nThree main files have been computed. The first is the basic file, containing raw data. The second is \nthe \"pairs\" file, in which statistical observations are pairs of labs. The third is the \"networks\" file, in \nwhich the statistical observations are the contracts, which, we call, by abuse, \"networks\". A contract \ninvolves several labs working in collaboration on the same project. \n \nAll those files are of rectangular type, which means that they look like matrixes, in which the rows are \nobservations, and the columns are variables. Each cell constituted by the intersection of a row X and \na column Y contains the value of the variable Y for the observation X, that is to say, Y(X).   \n \nThe basic file contains the exact translation of the questionnaires, names excepted. Each line is a \nquestionnaire, and the columns are the answers to the various questions. This means 425 lines. \nThis basic file was used to check and \"debug\" the data. Once the file cleaned, it was transformed in \nthe so-called \"pairs file\", and computed with the SAS statistical package. \n \nIn the pairs file, observations are pairs of labs. Remember that, unlike couples, pairs are ordered : the \npair of labs (A, B) and the pair (B, A) are two distinct observations. \nThe variables are all the variables in the questionnaire, including contract information and the \nanswers to closed questions. This means that, for a pair (A, B), the answers of A to the questions Q2 \nand Q3 have been attributed to (A, B). Also have been attributed to this pair the variables concerning \nthe contract in which it answered about its relations with B7.  \n \nStatistical analysis of the pairs file showed a massive effect of the programme on the declared \nrelationships. The following table shows the frequency of each type of relationship between pairs, \n\"before contract\" and \"after\". This can be considered as a raw quantitative indicator of network \nactivity. \n                                                     \n7 In some hypothetical case, suppose A and B are both involved in contract X and also in contract Y. A has \nreceived two questionnaires, one concerning contract X, and one concerning contract Y. B has also received two \nquestionnaires, one for evaluation of contract X, and one for Y.  If A and B have both sent back their \nquestionnaires to us, we have 4 questionnaires, that contain the following pairs : (A,B,X), (A,B,Y), (B,A,X), \n(B,A,Y). The pair file will contain 4 different pairs.  \n \n9 \n \n  before contract after8 \n no contact 24,4% 3,9% \n casual contacts 32,2% 16,9% \n  \n personal contacts 35,1% 39,4% \n exchange of research material 9,5% 30,2% \n interchange of scientists 10,4% 32,9% \n co-authoring 15,6% 44,5% \n regular seminars 5,9% 41,3% \n permanent collaboration 7,8% 32,4% \n sharing funds 3,4% 11,7% \n \n\"Positive items\" (co-authoring etc.) increased, while \"negative items\" (no contact, casual contacts) \ndecreased. Existence of personal contacts between scientists of different labs apparently remains \nunchanged. But the number of scientists involved in each lab has probably increased. \n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n35%\n40%\n45%\nno\ncontact\ncasual\ncontacts\npersonal\ncontacts\nexch. of\nmaterial\nexch. of\nscientists\nco-\nauthoring\nregular\nseminars\nperma-\nnent\ncollabo-\nration\nsharing\nfunds\nbefore after\nProfile of relationships between partners, before and after contract.\n(pairs file)\n \n \n2.4.2. Networks \n \nAnalysis of the pairs file, through bilateral relationships, showed a sharp increase of the number, type \nand level of these relationships. Indeed, the programme affected the labs. But the whole is more than \nthe bare sum of parts, and what we want to investigate here is precisely this \"more than the bare \nsum\". Has some structure (network ?) appeared during the programme ? We then come to the \nnecessity of comparing the group of labs involved in a contract before and after the programme, to \nsee how this group as a whole has changed. We thus created a file where the individuals are the \n                                                     \n8 Total is higher than  100% since items are non-exclusive. Results are computed on \"pairs\" file. \n \n10 \nnetworks. \n  \nIn this file, observations are contracts. We assimilate a contract (convention between different labs \nand the EC, where the EC funds those labs as a group to work in common on a specific project) to the \ngroup of tender labs. We did so with the idea that a group of labs working together on a single project \nmight become a small network.  So the underlying idea is : let us take a group of labs involved in a \ncontract with the EC.  We are going to measure whether they are \"more of a network\" after the \ncontract, when they have worked together on the same project in this EC Programme frame, than \nbefore. If yes, we shall conclude that this programme indeed creates or enhances networks. As one \ncan see, the idea is very simple, except for the fact that we have little knowledge of how to measure \nthis \"networkness\". \n \nHow can we sum up information concerning labs connected in a contract, so as to consider a network \nas one single object ?  \n \nThe information concerning the contract itself (number of labs in the contract, discipline, nature of \ncontract), is not a problem.  \nFor the closed questions (e.g. : what is the frequency of contacts with other labs ?), it is not so difficult \n: we can get a mean value of the answers of pairs in contract, for each modality, or for the frequencies \nof contact, synthesize a continuous variable (once a week = 52, once a month =12 etc.), and compute \nthe mean value for all respondents in one contract. \nThe main problem lies, of course, in the computation of a mean \"value\" for relationships between labs. \nThe gross solution would be to consider each type of relation as an independent variable, and \ncompute the mean. \n \nFor example, if the structure of answers for a contract involving A, B, and C, is : \n   \"before\"   \"after\" \n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   0 1 2 3 4 5  6 7 8 \n (A,B)  1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0  \n (A,C)  0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0   0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0  \n (B,C)  1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  \n (B,A)  1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0  \n (C,A)  0 0 0 0 0 10 0 0   0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0  \n (C,B)  01 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 \n \nwe can create for the contract the same 18 variables (9 before and 9 after), and compute for each \nvariable the column mean on all respondents. For example, the first variable will have the score \n(1+1+1)\/6 = 0.5, the second will have the value 1\/6, etc. The problem is that this way of doing implies \na considerable loss of information, because we loose the information on combinations. For instance, \nthe value 1\/6 for the second variable would be the same if the \"1\" came from pair (C, A) and not from \n \n11 \npair (C, B). And, if it came from pair (C, A), the relationship-before between (C, A) would then be \n010001000 and not 000001000.  So, computing in this way is not fully satisfying on theoretical \ngrounds.  \n \nTherefore, our first option, before we started dealing with the real data, was the following. We \ncomputed all the 257 combinations of relationships between pairs (in fact, 257 before, and 257 after). \nEach pair was assigned a \"1\" on the combination it declared, and \"0\" in all others. Until here, no loss \nof information. We then applied the computation of means described in the former paragraph on those \ncombined variables.   \n \nThis solution has many theoretical advantages that shall not be described here, for the simple reason \nthat, unfortunately, on real data, the result showed less satisfying than with the grosser method. We \nhad expected precision increase with this method, since it had proved much more efficient in a former \nstudy 9. The underlying problem is that the file is too full of \"holes\" (zeroes) to get good enough \ndistribution curves on each variable, so that the artifacts of the method overcome significant results, \neven if those results do not shock common-sense. Such a heavy method  (in computing terms) is to \nbe applied, if ever, only on large or very dense networks, but this could hardly be known before \ntesting.  \n \nSo we used the gross method, the \"contracts\" file is mainly a computation, by contract, of the means \nof the \"pairs\" file. \n \n3. Results on networks \n \nThe same methodology was applied to \"pairs file\" and \"contracts file\". Both analyses yield similar \nresults : there is a sharp increase of all forms of relationships between labs compared to the situation \nbefore contract, building relationships seems to be a progressive but probably non-linear process, \nrelationships are cumulative. Only the results on the contracts file will be presented here after, since \nthey prove more interesting in respect of network assessment methodology. \n \n3.1. Network analysis \n \nFirst, we can look at what is the declared use of contracts. On the following graph, each item is \nrepresented with the mean value in contracts (remember the items were rated from 0 -\"this is not how \nwe use it\"- to 4 -\"we use it mainly for that\"-), Therefore, the higher the value, the higher the item was \nrated by respondents. The graph shows that the contracts were mainly used for building a permanent \n                                                     \n9 An attempt to  determine empirical proximities between foodstuffs by classification under contiguity constraint in \ntwo successive factorial spaces. The subject is a bit far from network assessment, but, formally, the problems are \nvery close (Lahlou, 1988). \n \n12 \nnetwork, and enhancing existing contacts10.  \n \n0 0,5 1 1,5 2 2,5\nargument to get more money\nget into big EEC projects\ncollab. in home contry\nrecruit scientists\ntrain scientists\nfromulate new priorities\ntravel abroad\n extra financial support\nmake new contacts\nmore co-publication\ncollab. abroad\nenhance existing contacts\nbuild permanent network\nWhat was the use of SSP for the networks ?\n(mean values of items per network)\n \nIf we now look at the general evolution of relationships within contracts, we find  that all \"positive\" \nforms of relations have significantly increased. The most important development was the rise in \ninterchange of scientists and co-publication in most contracts. But the most spectacular increase \ncomes in the items \"seminars\", and \"permanent collaboration\". \n \n0\n0,1\n0,2\n0,3\n0,4\n0,5\n0,6\n0,7\n(mean values of items per network)\nno \ncontact\ncasual \ncontact\npersonal \ncontact\nexch. \nresearch \nmaterial\ninterchange \nscientists\nco \npublication\nseminars permanent \ncollaboration\nsharing \nfunds\nPresences of different types of relations within networks\nbefore contract after\n \n \n                                                     \n10 The same result was observed on the pairs file. \n \n13 \nThe main difference between this analysis on contracts and the analysis of pairs is that, here, our \nobservations are local networks. For all items, we consider the mean value in local networks \n(contracts)11. This analysis shows slightly better effects of the programme than when observed on \npairs, because it includes what we could call \"network effect\", that is, some relations can be present in \na network only through one or two pairs. \n \nThe network effect is probably one of the reasons why increase in relationships can be so fast. For \nexample, suppose A, B and C are in a contract ; A  and B have close relations, but C is a newcomer \nthat only has casual relations with A. We can suppose that, as C gets closer to A during the contract, \nhe will also get closer to B, through some positive scale effect. The newcomer benefits of the already \nexisting level of relationship, as if he adapted to a \"baseline\" level that is already high. This is \nsociologically understandable : if the general atmosphere of a meeting is already very informal and \nfriendly, newcomers will sooner reach this communication style ; existing procedures between \npartners can simply be copied by newcomers, instead of having to be invented\u2026 \n \n3.2. Factors structuring networks \n \nWe tried to synthesize the state of relationships within networks, using multivariate data analysis \ntechniques. The idea is to consider networks as objects characterized by their profile of relationships, \nand to build such a space that would be organized by the main \"dimensions\" of relationship pattern. In \nsuch a space, dimensions will be the organizing factors of the relationship pattern. Such dimensions \nwill oppose types of relations that are negatively correlated (e.g. : \"no contact\" & \"permanent \ncollaboration\"), and bring together types of relations that are positively correlated (that is, that are \nobserved to go together in contracts, e. g. \"exchange of research material\" & \"co-publication\"). \n \nAs multivariate analysis has the property of giving somewhat symmetrical role to variables (relations) \nand observations (contracts), in such a space, contracts that have the same pattern of relationship will \nflock together, and be distant from contracts that have other types of relationship. \n \nSeveral methods have been tested12, on several types of files, and they give comparable results. We \nshall present here only one of these, a  principle component analysis where the active variables are \nthe 9 variables \"after\". Roughly, this space is organized by the correlation between the relational \nvariables \"after\". We hereby built a relational space in which contracts are placed. \n \n                                                     \n11 E. g. a value of 0.5 for an item means that there is a mean of 50% pairs in each contract that have that kind of \nrelationship. For example, let us consider a \"typical contract\" that would have the mean characteristics of our \nsample. Before SSP,  10% of the pairs in in this contract exchanged research material, and now they are 35% to \ndo so. \n12 Multiple Component Analysis (using contingency  tables on modal variables) on relations \"before\" only, on \nrelations \"now\" only, on relations \"before\" and \"now\" simultaneously, and the same analyses using Principal \nComponent Analysis, which deals with continuous variables and hence can be used with the \"contracts\" file, but is \nsensitive to mass effects.  \n \n14 \nThe analysis yields three main factors. \n \nFactor 1 is a factor of density of relationships. On one side, it is correlated with co-authoring, \ninterchange of scientists and research material, seminars and personal contacts. On the other side, it \nis correlated with no contacts and casual contacts. One could say this factor opposes dense \nrelationships and scarce relationships. This is easy to understand : relations are roughly correlated, \nlabs that have a close work together will use most types of relations, when loose collaboration implies \nfew of all the types of relations. \n \nFactor 2 deals with the range of relationships. On one side, it is correlated with personal contacts, \nexchange of research material, and casual contacts. On the other side, it is correlated with sharing \nresearch funds and permanent collaboration. We infer that this factor opposes personal relations \n(scientist-centered) and institutional relations (between labs). This effect reminds us that institutions \nare objects consisting of people. The objects we observed are the institutions, but in fact there are two \ntypes of relevant objects in networking : people (building social networks) and structures (building \nbusiness networks). One can predict boldly that this effect will be observed in all measurements of \nnetworks between organizations. \n \nFactor 3 opposes the tone of relationships. On one side, it is correlated with interchange of scientists \nand co-authoring ; on the other side it is correlated with sharing funds and exchange of research \nmaterial. It seems to oppose academic relationships and material-oriented relationships. This is a \npragmatic distinction that enlightens the nature of networks : several strategic objectives of the actors \nmight underlie the visible effects of networks. It seems here that scientists produce two types of \noutcomes : academic publications, and experimental results, and that a network might develop a local \nculture oriented more towards one than towards the other. This result is consistent with academic \ncommonsense, and shall not be further discussed here. \n \nIn conclusion, beyond the obvious and expected results of the first factor (quantitative intensity  of \nrelationships is a main dimension), other dimensions of scientific network appear, that measure \nqualitative factors :  relations between labs can be between institutions or between scientists, and can \nbe rather classically (academic) or more project oriented. These empirical results enrich our original \nview of \"dense networking is more relationships\". \n \nIf we project on the first plane the most significant items, we can see some interesting results. For \nexample contracts involving only 2 labs yield more intense relationships, and then labs as institutions \nare involved, while contracts involving many labs seem to have connected scientists rather than \ninstitutions. \"Operations\" contracts (result oriented) induced more personal relations than \"twinning\" \ncontracts (intended to bring together labs). Contracts oriented towards \"training scientists\" have a \nrather institutional tone\u2026 \n \n \n15 \naxis 1\naxis 2\naf-regular-seminars\nscience\nn=4\naf- no-contact\nengeniring.\nmathematics\nearth-sciences\noperation\naf-exch-resear-mat.\nn=6\naf-sharing-funds\nn=9\naf-exch-scientists\nlife-sciences\nn=2\naf-co-authored-publi\nn=5scient.-instrume\naf-person.-contacts\naf-permanent-collab\naf-casual-contacts\nn=7\nn=8\nn=15\nfar out\nlowintense\npersonal\ninstitutional\n \n \nProjection on second plane (axes 1 & 3) mainly shows the material orientation of contracts in scientific \ninstrumentation and earth sciences, chemistry, and engineering sciences, while contracts oriented \ntowards recruiting scientists have a more academic tone13 \naxis1\naxis3\nscience\nn=4\naf- no-contact\nengeniring.\nmathematics\nearth-sciences\ntrain.-scientists\nn=6\ncur-resear-op-weekly\narg-to-mor-money\nchemistry\naf-exch-scientists\nlife-sciences\nrecruit.-scientis\nn=2\naf-co-authored-publi\nn=5\nscient.-instrumematerial\nacademic\n \nWe shall not insist on those results. First, because multivariate analysis is never a proof, but only a \n                                                     \n13 Here must be said that qualitative analysis showed that \"exchange of research material, although \nDATA were namely included in the question) seems to have been too often understood as \nexchanging ponderous material (matter, and not information). This probably induces some bias in our \nresults. Still, the results obtained seem to convey significant information. \n \n \n16 \nclue. Second, because they are linked with this specific programme, and we are here interested in \nmethodology, not in specific results. \n \nWhat must be retained of this analysis is that networks can be considered as objects characterized by \nsome specific dimensions. These dimensions, in this case, are measurable by their coordinates on \nfactors. It is, therefore, possible to measure those structures with quantitative indicators. In this case, \nthe scales would be global intensity of contact between partners, personal\/institutional tonality of \nrelationships, and material \/academic orientation of research production.  \nGiven those scales, it is then possible to measure what is the influence of various variables (amount \nof contract, subject, discipline, countries of origin, number of labs\u2026) on the evolution of networks, by \ncrossing those scales with the variables.  \n \nLet us now look at the position of contracts before and after in this space of relations. \n \naxis 1\naxis 2\nZ\nhigh low\npersons\nlabs\nrelation level\nbetween\nbefore\nafter\n \nOn this graph, contracts are projected in their before (\"+\") and after (\"\u001f\") positions on the first factorial \nplane (axis 1 = factor 1 and axis 2 =factor 2). The zone where most \"before\" contracts are is circled \nwith a dotted line, when the zoner of \"after\" contracts is circled in dark zebra line. Obviously, we see \nhere the general effect of the Programme : networks moved from the up-right zone (few contacts, \nbetween-scientists) to the down-left zone (intense, inter-labs contacts). We can then infer that the \nprogramme allowed the potential networks, initiated by  individual in several labs, to become intense \nrelationships involving their institutions.  \n \nAs intense relationships seem to involve labs (instead of individuals) more than scarce relationships, \none can wonder whether the success of SCIENCE \/STIMULATION Programme is linked with the fact \n \n17 \nthat it was, finally, centered on providing help on logistic aspects of research work, and not directly on \nresearch itself. Unlike other big programmes, oriented towards the production of a given kind of \nresults, SCIENCE provided non-specific logistic supports. To take a crude metaphor, suppose \nresearch is a trip in your car, where sectoral EC research programmes provide the gasoline, \nSCIENCE provided oil to the motor. \n \nAs one can see, this analysis allows to feed the evaluation commission with questions concerning the \nvery mechanisms of programme impact on networks.  \n \n3.3. Classification of networks \n \nAnother way to assess the effect of the programme is to make a classification of the pairs of labs, \nbefore contract and after, according to the type of relationships they have. Instead of rating the level \nof relationships with quantitative indicators, we try here to see how many labs switched from a \nposition in a class with low relationship to a high relationship class. The rate of labs that have not \n\"progressed\" would then be a quantitative indicator of the programme's degree of failure. \n \n \n3.3.1. Networks before \n \nWe made a classification of contracts \"before\" and \"after\". The classification was done with automatic \nhierarchic classification procedures. This procedure sets in the same class contracts that have the \nsame relational profile, by clustering14.  \n \nBefore contract, \"contracts\" can be classed in 4 different \"before\" classes. \n \nBF-Silent pair  (44 contracts, 25%) :  \nContracts in this class are characterized by a high rate of \"no contact\" between their pairs. These \ncontracts involve pairs of labs that do not know each other. This does not mean that all the labs do not \nhave contact with each other, but rather that we have \"chains\" (A is in contact with B, B with C, but A \nand C have no contact). This is why we called them \"silent pair\". \nThis class is more typical of labs who used SCIENCE to make new contacts (of course !), and often \nincrease collaboration with labs in their own country. Frequency of contact in these contracts was \nslightly lower than in other classes. \nIt is more typical of contracts involving more than 2 labs. \n \n                                                     \n14 In fact, the classification was made on the basis of the coordinates of contracts in factor spaces of \"relations \nbefore\" for the \"before classification\", and in the space of \"relations now\" for the \"now classification\", but, as all \nfactors were used, the result is theoretically the same as if we had used the basic sets of 9 binary corresponding \nvariables used for factor analysis. \n \n \n18 \nBF-Casual contact (68 contracts, 38%):  \nThis class contains contracts were relationships between pairs were mostly casual.  \nSCIENCE contracts were often used here to recruit new scientists, make new contacts, and  travel.  \n \nBF-Linked (52 contracts, 29%):  \nNetworks in these contracts can be considered already existing with a low relational profile. Co-\nauthoring, personal contacts, and interchange of scientists existed before award was obtained.  \nThe use of SCIENCE for the concerned labs was mainly : more co-authoring, recruiting scientists, \nenhance existing contacts. \nIt is more typical of contracts involving 2 labs (46 % of the 2-lab contracts are in this class, and they \naccount for  73% of the class). \n \nBF-Sharing funds (15 labs, 8%):  \nThis class contains contracts that have tight relations, and often shared research funds prior to the \ncontract. They declare \"permanent collaboration\", and most types of relations. \n \nThe following graph shows the respective importance of the \"before\" classes of contracts. \n \nLinked 29%\nCasual\ncontacts 38%\nSharing funds\n8%\nSilent pair 25%\n \n \n3.3.2. networks after the programme \n \nAfter contract, \"contracts\" can be classed in 6 different \"after\" classes. \n \nNCL-Silent pair (5 labs, 3%) :  \nThis class is similar to the \"silent pair\" class before. These contracts often include pairs who had \"no \ncontacts\" before. Note that this type of network fell from 25% to 3% after the programme. \n \nNCL-Casual contact (20 contracts, 11%):  \nThis class contains contracts were relationships between pairs are mostly casual, and personal. \nThese contracts often include pairs who had \"no contacts\" before contract. \n \n \n19 \nNCL-Weak links (50 contracts, 28%):  \nIn this class, relations of various types between labs exist, but are much lower than the average.  \n \nNCL-High\/personal (40 labs, 22%):  \nThis class contains contracts that have personal relations, exchange research material, co-publish, \nbut share no funds and do not declare permanent collaboration. Relations seem to lie mainly on a \npersonal basis. \n \nNCL-High\/labs (51 labs, 28%):  \nThis class contains contracts that interchange scientists, co-publish, and declare \"permanent \ncollaboration\". Relations here seem to be relations between labs as entities, more than personal \nrelations. It is more typical of contracts involving 2 labs. \n \nNCL-Sharing funds (13 labs, 7%):  \nThis class contains contracts that have tight relations, and share funds. They declare \"permanent \ncollaboration, and most types of relations, including exchanging research material. The level of \nrelationships of this NCL-sharing funds is higher than the BCL-sharing funds. \n \nThe following graph shows the respective importance of the \"after\" classes of contracts. \n \nHigh Lab 28%\nSharing funds\n7%\nSilent pair 3%\nCasual contacts\n11%\nWeak Links 28%\nHigh personal\n22%  \nWe could say that, before being award a contract, 29% of the cases could be considered as potential \nnetworks, and 8% as actual networks. \nAfter the support, only 14% of contracts have scarce or casual relations, and cannot be considered as \noperating networks. 28% can be considered as potential networks, 50% as actual networks, and 7% \nas good networks, with a high relational level. \n \n \n3.4. Changes \n \n20 \n \nThe following graphs show the evolution of the various classes, before and after contract. \nThe first shows what happened to the \"before\" classes.  \n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nSilent pair Casual\ncontacts\nLinked Sharing\nfunds\nSharing funds\nHigh Lab\nHigh personal\nWeak Links\nCasual contacts\nSilent pair\nBEFORE\nAFTER\n \n \nFor example, we can see (first column) that one half of the contracts that were in the BCL-silent pair \nclass before are after in the NCL-weak links class. \nAs expected, the relation after is all the more intense as it was strong before. But we can see (and this \nmight be a result of the \"network effect\") that an important percentage of contracts with rather low \nrelational level could improve its status quite well. \n \nThe second graph shows where the \"after\" classes come from. \n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nSilent\npair\nCasual\ncontacts\nWeak\nLinks\nHigh\npersonal\nHigh Lab Sharing\nfunds\nSharing funds\nLinked\nCasual contacts\nSilent pair\nAFTER\nBEFORE\n \n \nIt shows the same conclusions. \nFor example, we can see that columns on the right (high personal, high labs, share funds) are darker \nthan the ones on the left, because those classes are made of contracts that already were in high-\nrelational classes before the programme. \n \n \n21 \nOne must remember that classes are unequal in size. This way of presenting histograms is therefore \nslightly dishonest, but it allows to see the effect better. However, this method allows to measure the \neffect of the programme, and, in some ways, to lighten the mechanism of network building within \ncontracts.  \n \nAnother way of approaching the network evolution mechanism is to look at the evolution of networks \nin the space of relationships. If we examine figure A in three dimensions (the 3 first axes), we can see \nthat it has grossly the shape of a horn, the point of which is on the right size (no contacts), and widens \ngradually as we go to the left and the relationships grow in intensity.  \nfactor 1\nfactor 2\nfactor 3\nlow\nintense\npersonal\ninstitutional\nmaterial\nacademic\n \nThis shape is logical : there is only one way of having no relationships with others, but, there are \nmany different ways of having a lot of relationship. We tried to check the existence of attractors, by \njoining together the position of networks \"before\" and after\".  On the following graphs, one can see, for \neach class before, the position of the networks \"before\" and \"after\"  \n \n22 \nX\nY\nZ\nsilent pair\n \nX\nY\nZ\ncasual contact\n \nX\nY\nZ\nweak links\n   \nX\nY\nZ\nshare funds\n \n \nAs one can see, the networks from each class evolve in a rather similar way in low relationship \nclasses, and divergence starts when relationships become intense. The general trajectory goes from \nthe small end of the \"horn\" to the large end. Those results confirm the previous, but data are too \nscarce to allow precise investigation of the existence of attractors. Nevertheless, the method seems \ninteresting and should be applied on further data. \n \nBefore we conclude, let us examine some results that show how these quantitative indicators could \nbe used for evaluation. \n \nHere is the repartition of the contracts by number of labs in network and class of relationships, before \nand after15.  The obvious effect is that the relationships are all the more intense that the networks are \nsmall, before contract or after. The programme enhanced relationship level in all types of networks, \nbut did not change this ranking. \n \n                                                     \n15 Only on networks involving 2 to 5 contracts, since bigger networks were not enough numerous to be \nstatistically significant. \n \n23 \nrelation class \/network size : before   relation class \/network size : after \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nn=2 n=3 n=4 n=5\nb-share funds\nb-linked\nb-casual\nb-silent pair\n%\n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nn=2 n=3 n=4 n=5\nn-share funds\nn-high lab\nn-high personal\nn-weak links\nn-casual\nn-silent pair\n%\n \n \nIn the same way, results concerning the effect of discipline, of funding amount, of declared use of \nfunds by the labs, of nationality, could be obtained, with their degree of statistical significance.  \n \n4. Conclusion : main results \n \nThe study allowed to draw the following conclusions : \n  \nThe impact of the programmes, as measured by the quantitative survey, is strongly positive on the \ndensity of relations within networks. All forms of collaboration studied increased sharply within pairs of \nlabs, often with a factor 3. Before the contract, half of the pairs had little or no contact, and less than \n30 %  can be considered having a significant level of relations between labs. After contract, only 18% \nof pairs have little or no contact, and one can consider that at least 37% of them are then involved in \nwhat seems to be strong relationships including sharing research material,  funds and personnel. \nThe frequency of contacts between labs varies between phases of collaboration. Frequency of \ncontacts between labs remains relatively low by social standards : generally  from 1 to 3 contacts per \nmonth. \nRoughly, the stronger the relations before, the stronger they are after. Still, many pairs went directly \nfrom low-level relationships to high-level ones. But growing relationships between labs do not follow a \nlinear development. There is a gap between no contacts and casual contacts, and two steps seem to \nmake a big difference : exchange of research material, first, and then sharing funds on research \nprojects.  \n \nIf we now consider local networks, the results are about the same, but we can measure them in a \ndifferent way : before awards, 29% of contracts could be considered as potential networks, and 8% as \nactual networks. Afterwards, only 14% of contracts have scarce or casual relations, and cannot be \nconsidered as operating networks. 28% can be considered as potential networks, 50% as actual \n \n24 \n \nnetworks, and 7% as good networks, with a high relational level. \nThe existence of a \"network effect\" that would allow labs to increase their relationships with other labs \nby transitivity should be investigated.\" \n \nThese conclusions helped the evaluation panel in their assessment of the programmes, which was \nthe first objective of the survey. They were consistent with the other approaches used in this \nevaluation (peers review, qualitative survey). \n \nApart from the local use for this specific evaluation, and beyond all its technical limitations, this survey \nallows us to make some general methodological conclusions. A light-and-fast quantitative survey can \nyield pragmatic results on evaluating the impact of an external incentive on existing networks. As \nthese surveys cannot, by construction, yield a very large amount of information, they must be \nconnected with qualitative analysis in order : \n   a) before survey, to define precisely the evaluation criteria and their  \n   measurement scale,  \n   b) after survey and during data processing, to valid hypotheses and enlighten \n   the specific problems that appear during data analysis. \n \nNetwork assessment can be roughly done with the crude statistical methods used in this survey. \nBehavioral approach for relationship description can lead to network scaling, and comparison \nbefore\/after allows research on the mechanism of network pattern evolution. This method is \napplicable wherever the boundaries of the networks to be studies are known, which is a very \nrestrictive case. Still, as methods for identifying network boundaries in a general population of \nindividuals are available, the method could be applied to study the evolution of the network local \nstructure in time, even if their boundaries change, provided that networks are individually identified. \n \n"}
