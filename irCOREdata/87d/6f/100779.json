INTRODUCTION\nNuclear magnetic resonance \u0001NMR\u0002 spin-lattice \u0001T1\u0002 and\nspin-spin \u0001T2\u0002 relaxation-time measurements have been\nshown to be a powerful tool for the characterization of liq-\nuids in porous media \u00031\u0004. The fast exchange model of relax-\nation is often invoked and provides a powerful means of\ncharacterizing the pore surface-to-volume ratio. According to\nthis theory, the observed relaxation rate is the weighted av-\nerage of that for fast relaxing nuclei in molecules associated\nwith pore surfaces and that for more abundant, but more\nslowly relaxing nuclei associated with molecules in the bulk\nliquid filling the pore \u00032\u0004. In other work, NMR pulsed field\ngradient measurements of self-diffusion \u0001D\u0002 of liquids in po-\nrous media and, in particular, of restricted diffusion, have\nbeen shown to be equally important for the characterization\nof pore structures \u00033\u0004. More recently, two-dimensional relax-\nation correlation experiments, first suggested in the early\n1980\u2019s \u00034\u0004, have come to the fore \u00035\u0004 following the availabil-\nity of robust methods of performing the requisite 2D inverse\nLaplace transform \u00036\u0004. In the usual form of these experi-\nments, a measurement of T1 made in a first measurement\ninterval is correlated with a measurement of either T2 or D\nin an immediately following second interval. In particular,\nT1-D experiments have been shown to be well suited to the\nseparation of signals from oil and water in reservoir rocks\n\u00037\u0004. Others have applied the methods to the characterization\nof emulsions and foods \u00038,9\u0004. The T2-T2 experiment is much\nless common and to date has not been part of this resurgence.\nHowever, it was first proposed more than a decade ago by\nLee et al. \u000310\u0004. The experiment is made useful by the inclu-\nsion of a magnetization storage period between the T2 encod-\ning periods, T2-store-T2, during which the magnetization is\nheld along the longitudinal direction and during which ex-\nchange can occur.\nCement-based materials are a further significant class of\nporous materials. Understanding nanoscale pore-water inter-\nactions is important for both new build with fresh materials\nand for the repair of existing structures. With new build, for\ninstance, knowledge of the degree of cure of cement is criti-\ncal to the construction timeline. With regard to repair, it is\naccepted that nearly all forms of degradation of cement-\nbased materials are ultimately linked to the availability of\nwater and its transport through the porous structure.\nPrevious NMR relaxometry studies of cements have\nlargely focused on simple measurements of T1 and T2\n\u000311\u201313\u0004 and\/or D \u000314,15\u0004. These measurements have gener-\nally shown three or more distinct relaxation reservoirs that\nare generally associated with chemically combined water\n\u0001the shortest T2\u0002 through water in the cement gel structures\n\u0001CSH\u0002 and onto water in capillary pores and microcracks\n\u0001the longest T2\u0002. While the broad picture remains constant\nacross these several reports, numerous factors conspire to\nleave considerable uncertainty in the overall interpretation.\nAmongst these are the variety of materials and water-to-\ncement ratios used; the varying cure regimes adopted and\nhence the varying degree of cure and saturation of porosities\nencountered; the different NMR spectrometer frequencies\navailable; and the acknowledged difficulty of inverting spin-\nrelaxation data to yield relaxation rates.\nIn an earlier paper \u000316\u0004 we showed that T1-T2 correlation\nexperiments are valuable in helping to understand pore-water\ninteractions in cement paste. Key findings included the fol-\nlowing:\n\u0001i\u0002 confirmation of a series of discrete-sized porosity res-\nervoirs;\n\u0001ii\u0002 the first observation of an off-diagonal peak linking\nrelaxation of 1H in the two smallest porosity reservoirs. This\nwas attributed to water exchange between the gel and capil-\nlary structures;\n\u0001iii\u0002 the observation that T1 \/T2=\u0002 is a constant greater\nthan 1 across the full spectrum of relaxation times for water\nin different-sized pore structures;*Corresponding author.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 74, 061404 \u00012006\u0002\n1539-3755\/2006\/74\u00016\u0002\/061404\u00019\u0002 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society061404-1\n\u0001iv\u0002 new analysis that extended a model of surface relax-\nation by a two-dimensional random walk of nuclei across a\npore surface passed paramagnetic relaxation sinks \u000317\u0004. This\nanalysis satisfactorily explained the constant \u0002, and, by mea-\nsurement of its frequency dependence \u000318\u0004, enabled an esti-\nmate of the pore surface residency time and the pore surface\n2D walk hopping time, both consistent with previous mea-\nsurements inferred from methodologically more complex\nfield-cycling NMR experiments \u000319,20\u0004.\nIt is the purpose of this paper to carry this work forward,\nboth in terms of the methodology and its analysis, and in\nterms of the interpretation of results in cements. For the first\npart, this paper focuses on analysis of the T2-store-T2 ex-\nchange experiment. Although in our previous paper we pre-\nsented the first use of a T2-store-T2 exchange experiment for\nstudying cement pastes, the application was not fully ex-\nplored and only very preliminary results were included. It is\nnow shown that this experiment has considerable advantages\ncompared to a T1-T2 experiment for studying materials such\nas cements. New calculations show that 2D spectra with\nstrong off-diagonal peaks can be observed unambiguously\nwith a T2-store-T2 experiment in cases where there is ongo-\ning exchange. Measurement of the relative intensity of the\noff-diagonal features as a function of the storage interval\nlength permits an estimate of the exchange rate to be made.\nIn the case of cement pastes this goes on to allow an estimate\nof water diffusivity within pore structures that can be com-\npared to theoretical modelling.\nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS\nSmall samples of white Portland cement were carefully\nhand mixed in the water-to-cement ratio 0.4 by mass, cast\ninto 10 mm NMR tubes, gently vibrated on a vibration table\nto remove entrapped air, and allowed to cure unsealed for the\nfirst few hours. As soon as the samples solidified, a small\nquantity of saturated Ca\u0001OH\u00022 aqueous solution \u0001simulated\npore-water\u0002 was poured onto the samples to allow continued\ncure underwater. This solution was temporarily removed dur-\ning NMR measurements but replaced immediately thereafter.\nNotwithstanding this methodology, it is likely that a signifi-\ncant fraction of the open capillary porosity remained devoid\nof water since it is known that it is extremely hard to manu-\nfacture fully saturated samples. Samples were stored at\n20 \u00b0C.\nSamples were investigated with the T2-store-T2 exchange\nexperiment, defined by the pulse sequence\nP90-\u0001\u0003i\u0004echo-P180-\u0003i\u0004echo-echo-\u0002m-P90-\u0004delay-\nP\n\u221290-\u0001\u0003 j\u0004echo-P180-\u0003 j\u00042-echo-\u0002n-\u0004RD.\nThis experiment consists of three time intervals: t1, t2, and t3.\nDuring the first interval a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill\n\u0001CPMG\u0002 pulse train consisting of m inversion pulses and\nechoes is applied. In our implementation, the inversion pulse\ngap increases throughout the sequence according to a geo-\nmetric sequence \u00012\u0003i\u0004echo , i=0,1 , . . . ,m\u22121 and \u0003=constant\u0002\nin order to span efficiently the entire range of relaxation\ntimes from tens of microseconds to seconds. At the end of\nthe sequence, at the time of the mth echo, a 90\u00b0 pulse is\napplied so as to store the magnetization along the z axis.\nPhase cycling is used between averages so as to store along\nboth +\/\u2212z \u0001see theory\u0002. The magnetization is stored for the\nperiod \u0004delay = t2. Thereafter, the magnetization is recovered\nwith a further 90\u00b0 pulse. During the third period t3, a second\nCPMG sequence of n inversion pulses similarly spaced in\ngeometric progression is applied and the series of echo in-\ntensities is recorded. The experiment is repeated for m\n=1,2 , . . . ,n with repetition delay \u0004RD. In this manner, a\nsquare two-dimensional relaxation data set is acquired.\nMeasurements were made at room temperature on a\n20 MHz 1H NMR frequency Maran benchtop spectrometer\n\u0001Oxford Instruments Molecular Biotools Ltd, Oxon, UK\u0002.\nThe 90\u00b0 pulse length was 2.5 \u0005s. In a typical experiment, the\ninversion pulse gap interval of the CPMG sequence in-\ncreased from 60 \u0005s to 0.2 s over n=32 echoes so that the T2\nrange up to circa 1 s was well explored. However, signal\nfrom the chemically combined water \u0001with a T2 of only a few\nmicroseconds\u0002 was not seen. The storage interval t2 was kept\nconstant in any one experiment and was of the order of\n0\u201330 ms. As many as 128 averages of each echo train were\nrecorded with a repetition time of 1 s in an experiment last-\ning circa 2.5 hours.\nThe 2D data sets were carefully phased prior to analysis.\nNone of the data sets showed a noticeable baseline offset.\nRelaxation time distributions were extracted from the data by\n2D Laplace inversion using the algorithm proposed by Ven-\nkataramanan et al. \u000321\u0004 using software running on a desktop\ncomputer. All subsequent data plots are as output by this\nalgorithm except that intensities have been normalized to the\nnumber of averages recorded.\nIII. THEORY\nA. T2-store-T2 experiment\nWe consider two reservoirs of magnetization, Ma and Mb,\ncorresponding to 1H \u0001water\u0002 in pores of different sizes. There\nis exchange between the reservoirs. The system of coupled\ndifferential equations governing the relaxation of the magne-\ntization in the reservoirs is well known \u000322\u0004, viz.,\ndMa\ndt\n= \u2212 kaMa + kbMb + Ra\u0001Ma\neq\n\u2212 Ma\u0002 ,\ndMb\ndt\n= \u2212 kbMb + kaMa + Rb\u0001Mb\neq\n\u2212 Mb\u0002 , \u00011\u0002\nwhere ka,b is the exchange rate, Ra,b is the nuclear spin-lattice\nor spin-spin relaxation rate as appropriate, Ma,b\neq is the equi-\nlibrium magnetization for each reservoir for the relevant pro-\ncess, and t is time.

In\nour previous work on cements at a Larmor frequency of\n20 MHz we observed two principal relaxation reservoirs of\ncomparable volume differing in T1 by a factor of approxi-\nmately ten each with T2 a factor of 4 smaller. The common\nT1 \/T2 ratio of 4 is discussed further in the next section. Here\nwe focus on how the four peak intensities vary with the\nstorage time t2 for different exchange rates.\nWe have performed numerical calculations with Ma\neq\n=Mb\neq\n=0.5 and T2a=T1a \/4=0.25 ms and T2b=T1b \/4\n=2.5 ms. For reservoirs of equal size, ka=kb=k. Figure 1\nshows simulated 2D correlation spectra for each of \u201cslow,\u201d\n\u201cmedium,\u201d and \u201cfast\u201d exchange rate \u0001k=0.2, 1.0, and\n5.0 ms\u22121, respectively\u0002 with a \u201cshort,\u201d \u201cintermediate,\u201d and\n\u201clong\u201d storage interval \u0001t2=0.2, 1, and 5 ms, respectively\u0002.\nThe terms slow and long etc. are defined relative to the dif-\nference in the spin-lattice relaxation rates. The calculated\nspectral peaks are delta functions: they have been artificially\nbroadened for the sake of pictorial clarity. The contour plots\nare all shown on the same vertical scale, relative to a zero\nbaseline, and are directly comparable.\nWith slow exchange and only a short storage interval \u0003Fig.\n1 \u0001bottom left\u0002\u0004, then the spectrum consists essentially of two\nstrong diagonal peaks P++ and P\u2212\u2212, of comparable amplitude\nand located close to the intersections \u0001T2 ,T2\u0002= \u00010.25,0.25\u0002\nand \u00012.5,2.5\u0002 where T2 is expressed in ms, as expected. In the\nlimit k\u21920 and t2\u21920 the peaks are of equal amplitude and\ncentered exactly on these intersects. With increasing ex-\nchange rate \u0001bottom center\u0002 the two diagonal peaks start to\ndrift and change in relative intensity such that one becomes\ndominant in the expected fashion. Additionally, two off-\ndiagonal peaks P+\u2212 and P\u2212+ appear as the signature of the\nongoing exchange. With fast exchange \u0001bottom right\u0002, only\none diagonal peak is seen at a location \u00010.45,0.45\u0002, deter-\nmined by the average T2 relaxation rate. The off-diagonal\npeaks are no longer seen. As the storage time increases \u0001from\nthe bottom to the top of Fig. 1\u0002, so the integrated intensity\nacross the four peaks declines due to spin-lattice relaxation\nlosses. This is particularly true for the lower diagonal peaks\nthat have short T2 and hence correspondingly short T1. It is\nalso true, however, that the fraction of the spectral intensity\nin the off-diagonal peaks increases.\nIn order to assess how the Laplacian inversion affects\ndata, we have simulated NMR signals and added noise and\nsystematic errors and subjected these to the 2D inverse\nLaplace transform for comparison with Fig. 1. The simulated\nsignals were generated with k=1 ms\u22121, t2=1 ms, T2a\n=0.25 ms, T2b=2.5 ms, and T1 \/T2=4. In the absence of\nadded noise, it can be seen, with reference to Fig. 2 \u0001top\u0002,\nthat the positions of the peaks obtained by this method are\nalmost identical to those obtained by direct numerical simu-\nlation \u0003Fig. 1 \u0001center\u0002\u0004. A comparison of the integrated peak\nintensities with the direct numerical simulations reveals an\nabsolute error of 3% in the intensity of the off-diagonal\npeaks. This translates to a relative error of 15% in the frac-\ntion of the intensity appearing in the off-diagonal peaks. The\ninclusion of 2% white noise \u0003Fig. 2 \u0001middle\u0002\u0004, made a mar-\nginal further difference to the inversion. However, the addi-\ntion of 1% baseline offset \u0003Fig. 2 \u0001bottom\u0002\u0004, distorted the\nplot, forcing the P\u2212\u2212 peak to lower values of T2.\nFigure 3 shows the calculated intensity within the off-\ndiagonal peaks IOD, relative to the total signal intensity ITOT,\nIOD\nITOT\n=\nP+\u2212 + P+\u2212\nP++ + P\u2212+ + P+\u2212 + P\u2212\u2212\n, \u000115\u0002\nplotted as a function of storage \u0001t2\u0002 and exchange time \u0001\u0004\n=1\/k\u0002 for T1a=4T2a=1 ms and T1b=4T2b=7.1 ms.

Surface relaxation\nThe observed spin-spin relaxation time T2OBS can be re-\nlated to a pore surface-to-volume ratio \u0001S \/V; pore size\u0002\nthrough the well-known equation\n1\nT2\nOBS =\n\u0007S\nV\n1\nT2\nS , \u000116\u0002\nwhere T2\nS is the relaxation time for 1H in molecules adsorbed\non the pore surface and \u0007 is the thickness of a surface layer.\nIn Eq. \u000116\u0002, the contribution of the bulk spin-spin relaxation\nrate has been eliminated due to its very small value. A key\nissue is to evaluate T2\nS\n. In our previous work \u000316,17,19\u0004, a\nmodel for surface relaxation was proposed and shown to be\napplicable. The model supposes biphasic fast exchange be-\ntween liquid molecules that are transiently adsorbed on the\npore surface and molecules in the bulk pore liquid phase.\nThe adsorbed molecules relax as they undergo 2D transla-\ntional diffusion in the dipolar field of the electronic spins\nfixed at the pore surface. The frequency dependence of this\nrelaxation has been carefully evaluated. It depends on two\ncorrelation times, namely, the correlation time \u0004m of surface\ndiffusion events and a finite residence time \u0004s of the protons\non the surface. In most cases \u0004m \/\u0004s\b1. In the case of T2, the\nmodel analysis yields the result\n1\nT2\nS =\n4\n9\n\tI\n2\ts\n2\n2S\u0001S + 1\u0002\nJL0\u00010\u0002 + 14JL0\u0001\u000bI \u2212 \u000bS\u0002 + 34JL1\u0001\u000bI\u0002\n+\n3\n2\nJL\n1\u0001\u000bS\u0002 +\n3\n2\nJL\n2\u0001\u000bI + \u000bS\u0002\u000b , \u000117\u0002\nwhere \tS and \tI are the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron\nand proton, respectively, S is the spin of the paramagnetic\nimpurities \u0001Fe3+\u0002 embedded in the pore surface, and \u000bS and\n\u000bI are the electron and proton resonant frequencies, and\nwhere\nJL\n0,1,2\u0001\u000b\u0002 =\n3\n40\n\f\rs\n\u000e4\n\u0004m ln\f 1 + \u000b\n2\u0004m\n2\n\r \u0004m2\n\u0004s\n2 \u000e + \u000b2\u0004m2 \u000f . \u000118\u0002\nHere, \rS is the surface density of paramagnetic impurities\nand \u000e is the distance of minimum approach of the water 1H\nto the paramagnetic \u0001Fe3+\u0002 ions. The result can be simplified\nusing the inequality \u000bS\u000f\u000bI\u0001\u000bS=658.21\u000bI\u0002. In the case of\nspherical pores, S \/V=6\/d, where d is the pore diameter and\n\u0007=x\u0010 where x is the number of adsorbed water molecules of\ndiameter \u0010 in the surface layer. For planar pores, such as\nmight better characterize CSH gel structures, S \/V=2\/d,\nwhere d is the pore width.\nA similar analysis has been performed for T1 from which\nthe ratio T1 \/T2 is calculated. For a fixed Larmor frequency,\nthe value achieved for T1 \/T2 is not universal but depends\ncritically on the ratio \u0004m \/\u0004s. In particular, T2 \/T1 reaches the\nvalue 4 when \u0004m \/\u0004s=10\u22123. What is important in our 2D\nT1-T2 data used to underpin the modeling in the previous\nsection, is the strong correlation of all the discrete pore size\ndistribution features along the line T1 \/T2=4. Given that\nparamagnetic impurities are expected to be distributed uni-\nformly throughout the solid matrix of the sample, this pro-\nvides strong supportive evidence for the surface diffusion\nmodel of proton nuclear spin relaxation in cements. Further\nsupport comes from the predicted frequency dependence of\nthis ratio, which agrees well with experimental results \u000318\u0004.\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nA. 2D correlation experiments\nFigure 4 shows the results of an experiment to measure\nT2-store-T2 correlations in a white cement sample 4 days old.\nIn this case, the storage interval was 10 ms. The spectrum\nshows a clear diagonal ridge with a primary peak P++ at circa\n\u0001T2 ,T2\u0002= \u00011,1\u0002 and two strong off-diagonal peaks P+\u2212 and\nP\u2212+ at circa \u00010.05,1\u0002 and \u00011,0.05\u0002, respectively. There is no\nevidence for the second lower diagonal feature P\u2212\u2212 and so,\nsuperficially at least, the spectrum is comparable to that in\nthe upper left of Fig. 1.\nFigure 5 shows a second example. In this case the storage\ntime is reduced to 1 ms. Now, overall, there is considerably\nFIG. 3.

The calculation parameters\nare given in the text.\nFIG. 4. Experimental T2-store-T2 2D correlation spectrum for a\nwhite cement paste with water-to-cement ratio 0.4 and three days\nold. The storage time is 10 ms. The spectrum, which shows a strong\nupper diagonal peak and two off-diagonal peaks, is qualitatively\ncomparable to the central part of Fig. 1.\nOBSERVATION OF EXCHANGE OF MICROPORE WATER\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 74, 061404 \u00012006\u0002\n061404-5\nmore intensity in the spectrum \u0001notice the expansion of the\ncontour interval\u0002. However, it is located predominantly along\nthe diagonal. The off-diagonal features are not seen. The\nspectrum is more comparable to the lower left of Fig. 1. The\nslight asymmetry in this spectrum could be due to one of\nseveral causes including ongoing hydration of the sample\nduring the measurement introducing systematic error or fail-\nure of the Laplace inversion.\nTo check the efficacy of the pulse sequence, a T2-store-T2\nexperiment with a store time t2=5 ms was performed on a\nfour-day-old sample of white cement. The experiment was\nrepeated with the first 90\u00b0 pulse of the sequence suppressed.\nIn the latter case, the signal intensity echo showed no signal\narising from unwanted coherences visible above the baseline\nnoise. Equally, the inverse Laplace transform spectrum\nshowed no clear structural features. The ratio of the inte-\ngrated intensity of the spectra between the two experiments\nwas \u00110.4%, well below the amplitude associated with the\nexchange peaks where they occur. We are therefore confident\nthat the observed exchange peaks are not an artifact of the\npulse sequence implementation.\nFigure 6 shows the fractional intensity in the off-diagonal\npeaks as a function of storage time for all the white cement\nsamples of age four days and water-to-cement ratio 0.4 that\nhave so far been surveyed in our laboratory. The circles are\nfor data recorded in the experiments discussed here. The tri-\nangles are for earlier preliminary experiments where the\nsignal-to-noise ratio was not as good. Also, the cement pow-\nder used was from a different \u0001older\u0002 batch and the sample\nstorage was not as carefully controlled as here. As expected,\nit is found that the fractional intensity in the off-diagonal\nfeatures increases with storage time. However, since the\noverall signal intensity is declining, so the measurement er-\nror also increases. The error bars have been obtained as fol-\nlows. The standard deviation of the baseline signal in the tail\nof the raw data was calculated. Gaussian white noise of the\nsame standard deviation was generated artificially and added\nto the raw data. The modified data was inverted and the peak\nintensities and ratios recalculated. The process was repeated\nseveral times and the standard deviation of the resultant peak\nintensities and ratios was thus calculated and taken as an\nestimate of the experimental error. It is noted that even after\nconsideration of the errors in this way, there remains consid-\nerable scatter in the data. There are at least two potential\nreasons for this. First, at four days, the cement is still hydrat-\ning and the microstructure rapidly developing during the\ncourse of the measurement. This is in strong contrast to other\nporous media often studied by these methods, such as rock\ncores. This could lead to systematic error. Moreover, when\ntwo measurements at different storage times are made on the\nsame sample, the measurements are necessarily for differ-\nently aged samples. If two samples are used, then they may\nbe significantly different due to the mechanical mixing and\nnatural sedimentation and bleeding of the cement. Second, as\nshown in Sec. III A, noise in the data and particularly a re-\nsidual baseline offset can systematically affect the Laplace\ninversion and hence the measured peak intensity ratio.\nThe solid line in Fig. 6 is an attempt to fit the theory of\nSec. III A to the data. A least-squares analysis has not been\npossible due to the very large number of unknown param-\neters and the fact that the sample almost certainly contains a\ndistribution of pore sizes. The fit shown is based upon two\nreservoirs of equal volume, as justified below, with T2 relax-\nation times of 250 \u0005s and 1.8 ms, respectively and corre-\nsponding T1 relaxation times four times longer. The ex-\nchange rate k is 0.2 ms\u22121. The analysis tends to overestimate\nthe rate of increase in the off-diagonal magnetization with\nincreased storage time. This is not readily overcome by vary-\ning the parameters within acceptable limits: better fits can\nonly be achieved by using unrealistically long T1 and T2\ntimes. However, without improved data, which our experi-\nence shows is very difficult to obtain, this discrepancy is not\nreadily resolved.\nFinally, Fig. 7 shows the total spectral intensity and the\nfraction of this intensity contained within the bottom left\ncorner spectral features \u0001i.e., that corresponding to the small-\nest and next-smallest pore-size porosity reservoirs\u0002 as a func-\ntion of the sample age for white cement pastes with a water-\nto-cement ratio of 0.4.

It is\nseen that the total magnetization remains constant within ex-\nperimental error throughout the curing period from 1 to 14\ndays. This suggests that the total water-filled porosity is not\nvarying greatly. Over 95% of the magnetization is found in\nthe spectral features corresponding to reservoirs of the two\nsmallest pores. Of this magnetization, the fraction occurring\nin the smallest gel pores increases from circa 45% to 62%\nover the same period. This is consistent with the growth of\nCSH gel phase. The two small pore reservoirs are of approxi-\nmately equal magnitude after three days, thereby justifying\nthe use of reservoirs of equal volume in the previous analy-\nsis.\nB. Measurement of the pore size\nTable I gives estimates of the parameters required to cal-\nculate the principal characteristic pore sizes in the measured\ncements using Eq. \u000116\u0002\u2013\u000118\u0002 along with the origin of these\nestimates. The experimentally measured values of the two\nprincipal relaxation reservoirs T2\nOBS are circa 300 \u0005s and\n2.0 ms. If the smaller pores are planar as seems reasonable\nfor CSH gel structures, then the water layer is calculated to\nbe 1.0+ \/\u2212 0.3-nm-thick. The larger pore shape is less cer-\ntain. If it is planar, then the most likely size is 6+ \/\u22122 nm; if\nspherical then the diameter is 19+ \/\u22126 nm. The significance\nof these sizes is discussed in Sec. V B. Here we focus on the\nmeasurement accuracy. The uncertainties in the above analy-\nsis are based on the uncertainties in the parameters given in\nTable I, including T2OBS, but excluding \u000e, the distance of clos-\nest approach of the water 1H to the ferric ions and x, the\neffective number of water molecules in the surface layer. The\nanalysis is sensitive to both of these values. Careful inspec-\ntion of the intermediate, values leading to these results sug-\ngests two related difficulties. The first is that 2x\u0010, the com-\nbined thickness of the two surface layers on either side of a\nplanar pore exceeds the pore thickness. The second is that\nthe surface relaxation time T2\nS\n=520 \u0005s exceeds the smallest\nvalue of T2\nOBS\n=300 \u0005s. Both results are physically unrealis-\ntic. If the calculation is repeated for smaller values of \u000e\n=0.20 nm and a monosurface layer x=1, then the pore size is\nincreased only slightly, as the two changes largely cancel.\nThe small planar pore spacing evaluates to 1.6+ \/\u22120.3 nm\nthick, for instance. However, a physically realistic value of\nT2\nS\n=100 \u0005s is found and the surface layers fit within the\npore. A distance of minimum approach \u000e=0.2 nm between\nthe proton and the ferric ions on the surface is greater than\nhalf of the water molecule diameter. However, it is known\nthat water has extensive hydrogen bonding capabilities and\nmay exchange protons with other surface sites. It may be-\nFIG. 7.

DISCUSSION\nA. 2D correlation experiments\nThe T2-store-T2 experiment has been shown to give 2D\nrelaxation spectra from white cement pastes with consider-\nable information content. The storage period is critical to the\nexperiment. Without it \u0001t2=0\u0002 the experiment collapses into\nno more than a conventional CPMG experiment, albeit with\nthe data collected and presented in an unusual fashion. As\nsuch, the inverted 2D spectrum is expected to be entirely\ndiagonal and to contain no additional information over its 1D\ncounterpart. This has been confirmed experimentally by the\nappropriate analysis of a 1D data set although the trivial\nresult is not shown here. The t2 interval breaks the inherent\nsymmetry of the experiment and yields off-diagonal peaks in\nthe presence of exchange so long as T1\u0001T2. With small stor-\nage time, the fractional intensity in the off-diagonal elements\nis small. As t2 gets longer, so the relative intensity in these\npeaks increases. However, the overall integrated intensity in\nthe spectrum decreases due to spin-lattice relaxation losses\noccurring during t2. The T2-store-T2 experiment has two sig-\nnificant advantages over the T1-T2 experiment, which was\nthe focus of our previous work. First, the new experiment\nmore clearly identifies and correlates measurements in two\nintervals t1 and t3 that are separated in time by a third inter-\nval, t2. It is therefore more straightforward to consider that\nthere is an exchange period during which the 1H are moving\nbetween reservoirs. Second, the off-diagonal peaks can be\nassigned unambiguously to exchange. If there is no ex-\nchange, then there are no off-diagonal peaks. In the case of\nthe T1-T2 experiment, theory shows that the off-diagonal\npeaks are antisymmetric. However, the fast Laplace inver-\nsion algorithm does not detect the negative peak and leaves\nthe ambiguity that the sole surviving positive off-diagonal\npeak may be due to a further 1H reservoir with T1\u0001T2, per-\nhaps a solid component. As an aside, we note that we previ-\nously suggested on the basis of preliminary results \u000316\u0004 that\nthe off-diagonal peaks in the T2-store-T2 experiment become\nasymmetric as t2 increases due to the T1 weighting. This is\nnow seen as erroneous from both the theoretical and experi-\nmental points of view. Equation \u00013\u0002 shows that the off-\ndiagonal peaks should be symmetric; equally, the further and\nimproved data such as is shown in Figs. 4 and 5 suggest that\nthis is true. The T2-store-T2 experiment is not always to be\npreferred over T1-T2. Empirically, we find that the T1-T2 ex-\nperiment is better for the quantization of the intensity of the\nlower diagonal peak; hence this experiment was used to gen-\nerate the data needed for Fig. 7.\nB. Measurement of the pore size\nThe calibration of the pore sizes suggests that the two\nprimary relaxation reservoirs seen both comprise rather small\npores. The smallest pore size is circa 1.0\u20131.7 nm. This is\nconsistent with estimates to be found in the literature of the\nCSH interplanar spacing, which range from 0.9 to 1.4 nm\n\u000327\u0004. However, the second significant reservoir suggests a\nsize ranging from 7 to 30 nm, dependent on pore shape and\ndetails of the surface water layer. This is much smaller than\nthe expected size of capillary pores. We therefore now sug-\ngest that the two observed reservoirs may be attributed to\nalternate gel structures. One possibility is that the smaller\npore-size reservoir is associated with the inner product, the\nlarger with the outer product, both created as the material\nhydrates. An alternate possibility is that the smaller-sized\npores are associated with the intersheet spacing within CSH\nand the larger with the spaces between the packets of CSH\nsheets comprising the gel, but still much smaller than the\nnormally accepted capillary porosity. This discussion will be\nexpanded in a future discussion of results obtained from spe-\ncific and otherwise \u0001e.g., by electron microscopy, etc.\u0002 well-\ncharacterized CSH phases such as alite. For the time being\nwe make just the following observations. The lack of directly\nobserved capillary water in larger pores is not inconsistent\nwith the methodology of preparation of the samples. The\nsamples are exposed to air for the first 12 h of cure, and\nalthough they are subsequently stored underwater, any open\ncapillary porosity is likely to remain unfilled except at the\nsample surface.\nFigure 7 suggests that the total volume of water-filled\nporosity within our samples is not changing with time. This\nis consistent with the known sample history where, although\nthe samples are cured underwater from age \u001012 h onward,\nthe mobile water content is unlikely to be changing signifi-\ncantly. However, Fig. 7 further shows that the distribution of\nwater between the different internal reservoirs is changing.\nThere is a clear increase in the fraction of water associated\nwith the smallest calcium silicate hydrate \u0001CSH\u0002 pores dur-\ning the first 14 days. This is consistent with a growth of\nCSH.\nC. Water diffusivity\nFinally, the data presented in Fig. 5 suggest an empirical\nexchange time of circa 5 ms between the two porosity reser-\nvoirs. The particle-size distribution of the cements used in\nthis study is strongly centered on a radius r=7.5 \u0005m. A typi-\ncal length scale between inner and outer product within a\nhydrating grain will therefore be r \/2\u00104 \u0005m. A diffusion\ncoefficient can be calculated from this time \u0001t=5 ms\u0002 and\ndistance \u0001a=r \/2=4 \u0005m\u0002 using the Einstein equation\nD =\n\u0011a2\u0012\n6t\n. \u000119\u0002\nThe result is 5\u000610\u221210 m2 s\u22121. In this simple analysis, issues\nsuch as tortuosity have not been considered and will be sig-\nnificant. Moreover, it is not clear exactly what the length\nscale corresponds to, since it is not yet clear exactly where\nthe water is moving from and to. Nonetheless, the value of D\nobtained is remarkably similar to that calculated by Kalin-\nichev et al. \u000328\u0004 using molecular dynamics simulations for\nwater diffusing in the pore space above the internal pore\nMONTEILHET et al.

They obtain 6.0\u000610\u221210 m2 s\u22121.\nWe have previously pointed out that a surface diffusion\ncoefficient based on a length derived from the size of a water\nmolecule \u0001a=\u0010=0.3 nm\u0002 and our previous measurements of\na surface hopping time \u0001t=\u0004m=1 ns\u0002 yield a diffusivity1 D\n=2.3\u000610\u221211 m2 s\u22121. This value is in good agreement with\nthe value of 5.0\u000610\u221211 m2 s\u22121 obtained by Kalinichev et al.\nfor water diffusing on the internal pore surfaces of tober-\nmorite, again by molecular dynamics simulation. This double\ncoincidence of agreement between diffusivities clearly war-\nrants further investigation.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nWe have presented the first detailed analysis of the NMR\nT2-store-T2 2D correlation-relaxation experiment and shown\nthat it has certain advantages over the T1-T2 variant previ-\nously studied. Experimental results for curing white cement\npastes have revealed new information about the water dy-\nnamics within the cement nanopores. The principal pore\nsizes of two porosity reservoirs have been carefully esti-\nmated and attributed to different structures with the CSH gel.\nFor the first time, the exchange rate between these structures\nhas been estimated. It is circa 5 m s\u22121. From this, the water\ndiffusivity within the CSH gel has been calculated and found\nto broadly correspond to the results of molecular-dynamic\nsimulations in related systems to be found in the literature.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank K.
