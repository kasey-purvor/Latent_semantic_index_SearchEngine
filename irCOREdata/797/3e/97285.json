Frie-\ndenrich and Orenstein [1] recently reviewed over 170 epi-\ndemiological studies and concluded that evidence for\ndecreased cancer risk with increased physical activity was\nconvincing for breast and colon cancer, probable for pros-\ntate cancer, possible for lung cancer and unknown for\nother sites. In breast cancer, physical activity has been\nwell documented to reduce cancer risk by almost 50% [2-\n4] in a wide range of populations but the mechanism of\nprotection remains unknown. Exercise-induced altera-\ntion of ovarian function with subsequent alteration of cir-\nculating hormones has been proposed. However, a recent\nstudy demonstrated that exercise also reduces breast can-\ncer risk in post-menopausal women [5]. Other proposed\nmechanisms include weight reduction and enhanced\nimmunological activity [1-3].\nThe transition from normal tissue to cancer is termed\ncarcinogenesis and is a prolonged, multi-step process.\nModels of carcinogenesis typically focus on heritable\nchanges that alter tumour survival, proliferation, senes-\ncence and apoptosis. Recently, it has been proposed that\n* Correspondence: kieran.smallbone@manchester.ac.uk\n1 Manchester Centre for Integrative Systems Biology, Manchester \nInterdisciplinary Biocentre, 131 Princess Street, Manchester, M1 7DN, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the articleBioMed Central\n\u00a9 2010 Smallbone et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Using mathematical mod-\nels, in vitro experiments, and clinical observations, it has\nbeen shown that proliferation of in situ cancers carries\nthe cells further away from the basement membrane and,\ntherefore, increasingly distant from the underlying blood\nsupply [6-8]. The resulting reaction-diffusion kinetics\nresults in marked hypoxia in cells more than 5 or 10 cell\nlayers from the basement membrane [9]. The consequent\nupregulation of glycolysis combined with long diffusion\ndistances for metabolites produces marked acidosis in the\nhypoxic regions [10]. It has been proposed that adapta-\ntion to hypoxia is critical in emergence of the malignant\nphenotype because the combination of adaptations with\nupregulation of glycolytic metabolism and resistance to\nacid-mediated toxicity confers a profound proliferative\nadvantage [9]. Specifically, this population produces an\nacidic environment through upregulated glycolysis that is\ntoxic to competing populations but not to its own cells.\nClinical observations in both breast [7] and cervical can-\ncers [11] have found evidence that successful adaptation\nto the hypoxia-glycolysis-acidosis sequence in the\nmicroenvironment is crucial during carcinogenesis.\nHere we use these results to propose an alternative\nmechanism for the protective effects of physical activity\nin cancer prevention. We hypothesise that exercise pro-\nduces toxicity within in situ cancers through transient\ndecreases in serum pH and, by doing so, delays or pre-\nvents somatic evolution of a malignant phenotype. To\nsupport this hypothesis, we note that there is clear evi-\ndence that even moderate exercise transiently decreases\nserum pH typically from its normal value of about 7.4 to\nabout 7.25. With moderate exercise for one hour, the\ndiminished pH level generally persists for about an hour\n[12,13]. Based on this, our detailed hypothesis is that\ndecreased blood pH will also transiently cause significant\nfurther decrease in extracellular pH (pHe) in the already\nacidic regions within in situ cancers. This abrupt increase\nin acid concentrations will result in tumour cell death and\ninterrupt the adaptive mechanisms necessary for subse-\nquent evolution to the malignant phenotype.\nThe hypothesis generates a number of initial questions:\n\u2022 Do transient decreases of blood pH decrease the\npHe of in situ cancers?\n\u2022 Are the intra-tumoral pHe effects linearly dependent\non the blood pH value or are there threshold levels?\n\u2022 If the pHe is decreased, is this change sufficient to\ninduce death in some of the tumour cells?\n\u2022 Will repeated transient episodes stop or slow the\nsomatic evolution process and thus delay or prevent\nemergence of invasive cancer?\n\u2022 If increased physical activity does alter in situ\ntumour growth and evolution, what is the optimal\nlevel of activity (exercise intensity and frequency)?\nTo address some of these questions, we frame our\nhypothesis using a mathematical model of the evolution-\nary dynamics and changing microenvironmental selec-\ntion conditions in in situ cancer. As we have previously\ndemonstrated, in situ cancers arise from epithelial sur-\nfaces and, as a result, grow into the ductal lumen and\naway from the underlying basement membrane. Because\nthe blood vessels remain on the opposite side of the\nmembrane, substrate and cellular metabolites must dif-\nfuse over increasing distances to reach the growing cell\nlayer that is farthest from the basement membrane. For\nthis reason, models of carcinoma in situ must include\nregional variations in oxygen, glucose and pHe. In turn,\nthese microenvironmental conditions produce differing\nselection forces resulting in regional variations in the\nevolved tumour phenotype. This system presents a mod-\nelling challenge. Continuous (partial differential equa-\ntion) models are well suited to modelling the diffusion-\nreaction kinetics that produce regional variations in sub-\nstrate and metabolite concentrations. On the other hand\nindividual-based models such as cellular automata (CA)\nare more appropriate when the evolutionary dynamics of\nindividual cells must be considered. However, traditional\nCA methods lack the ability to deal with continuously\nvarying elements such as substrate diffusion and utilisa-\ntion. Thus, hybrid CA have been developed to investigate\nearly cancer development [14-16]. In this paper we\nextend a hybrid CA we [17] have previously employed to\nexamine phenotypic evolution and microenvironmental\nconditions in in situ cancers under conditions in which\nsystemic pH varies.\nMethods\nAutomaton dynamics are described in detail elsewhere\n[17], but we briefly describe them here for completeness.\nThe two-dimensional model is composed of an M \u00d7 N\narray of automaton elements with a specific rule-set gov-\nerning their evolution, as well as glucose (g), oxygen (c)\nand H+ (h) fields, each satisfying reaction-diffusion equa-\ntions. A two-dimensional automaton is used as we focus\non growth away from the basement membrane, rather\nthan along the duct. In the model we reflect the avascular\ngeometry of premalignant epithelia by assuming that one\nedge of the array represents the basement membrane.\nWe consider the selective pressures placed on a number\nof different possible tumour phenotypes. Initially, the\nautomaton consists of a single layer of normal epithelial\ntissue. As well as proliferation and death, these cells may\nrandomly undergo three possible heritable changes,\neither through mutations or epigenetic changes such as\nalterations in the methylation patterns of promoters. The\ncells may become hyperplastic (allowing growth away\nfrom the basement membrane), glycolytic (increasing\ntheir rate of glucose uptake and utilisation) or acid-resis-\nSmallbone et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:22\nhttp:\/\/www.biology-direct.com\/content\/5\/1\/22\nPage 3 of 8tant (requiring a lower extracellular pH to induce toxic-\nity). These three changes give rise to 23 = 8 different\nphenotype combinations, and thus eight competing cellu-\nlar populations.\nCellular metabolism\nSuppose that the cell consumes glucose and oxygen at\nrates \u03d5g and \u03d5c, respectively, and that they are used to pro-\nduce ATP and H+ at rates \u03d5a and \u03d5h, respectively. In non-\ndimensional form, we have\nsubject to the condition \u03d5g \u2265 c. As a default value, we\nassume k = 10, i.e. that glycolytic cells demonstrate a ten-\nfold increase in glucose consumption.\nMetabolite profiles\nAfter each automaton generation, the known rates of\nmetabolite consumption and production for each cell are\nused to calculate the corresponding metabolite profiles.\nNote that metabolite diffusion time-scales (~minutes) are\nmuch shorter than the cellular proliferation time-scale\n(~days), and thus we may assume that metabolites are in\nequilibrium at all times. Assuming that diffusion is the\nprimary method for metabolite movement within the tis-\nsue, profiles are given in non-dimensional form by\nwhich may be solved on the square grid using a finite\ndifference approximation. As boundary conditions, we\nassume zero flux at the edge furthest from the basement\nmembrane (as there are no sources or sinks beyond this\npoint), and periodic boundary conditions at the two\nsides. At the membrane, we assume glucose and oxygen\nare fixed at their normal levels g0, j = c0, j = 1 (as the stroma\nis well-vascularised); H+ are also fixed, h0, j = hX, where the\nparameter hX reflects the level of systemic acidosis.\nCell dynamics\nCells may proliferate, adapt or die, and cells with different\nphenotypic patterns respond to the microenvironmental\npressures in different ways. As such, competition is incor-\nporated into the model: for a new population to progress\nand grow, it must successfully compete for space and\nresources with existing populations. The rules governing\nthe evolution of the automaton elements are as follows:\n\u2022 If the amount of ATP produced by a cell \u03d5a falls\nbelow a critical threshold value, a0, it dies, and the\nelement becomes empty; a0 represents the level of\nATP required for normal cellular maintenance.\n\u2022 The local H+ level may also induce cellular death,\nwith probability pdea, defined by\nwhere hN <hT. Thus the probability of cell death\nincreases with acidity, and the cell will always die if\nthe H+ level is greater than hN or hT, dependent on the\ncell type under consideration.\n\u2022 If the cell is not attached to the basement mem-\nbrane, and is not hyperplastic, it dies.\n\u2022 If the cell does not die through any of the mecha-\nnisms above, it either attempts to divide, with proba-\nbility pdiv, or becomes quiescent. The probability of\ndivision is a function of the cellular ATP production\nHence we assume that the probability of division is\nproportional to the ATP generated that is not needed\nfor maintenance. If there is more than one neighbour-\ning empty space, the new cell goes to the element with\nthe largest oxygen concentration (following [14]).\n\u2022 If a cell divides, each of the two daughter cells has\nprobability pa of randomly acquiring one of the three\nheritable characteristics (hyperplasia, glycolysis and\nacid-resistance). In order to avoid bias in the model,\nwe assume these changes are reversible. For example,\na cell displaying constitutive up-regulation of glycoly-\nsis may revert to normal glucose metabolism; if this\nmetabolism is most appropriate for the current\nmicroenvironmental conditions, the cell will success-\nfully compete for resources with its neighbours.\nTransient acidosis\nWhen investigating transient acidosis, each time-step is\nsplit into two parts: a time \u03c4 spent at high acidity hX, fol-\nf g\ng\nkg\n=\n\u23a7\u23a8\u23a9\nin a normal cell\nin a glycolytic cell\n,\n,\n(1)\nfc c= , (2)\nf fa gc n c= + \u2212( ), (3)\nf fh g c= \u2212 , (4)\nd gg g\n2 2\u2207 =x f , (5)\nd cc c\n2 2\u2207 =x f , (6)\n\u2207 = \u2212x f2h h , (7)\np\nh h\nh h\nN\nT\ndea\nin a normal cell\nin an acid-resistant cell\n=\n\u23a7\u23a8\u23a9\n\/\n\/\n(8)\np a aadiv = \u2212 \u2212( ) \/ ( ).f 0 01 (9)\nSmallbone et al.

Letting p0\ndenote the probability of death pdea, division pdiv, or\nmutation pa during one time unit (as defined in the previ-\nous section), the corresponding probability p of occur-\nrence during time \u03c4 8 [0, 1] is reduced according to\nThroughout the model formulation, we assume that\nvarious processes follow simple, linear dynamics. It can\nbe argued that these assumptions are too unrealistic to\nrepresent complex biological phenomena such as these.\nHowever, these processes are poorly understood and, as a\nfirst approximation, an assumption of linearity is suffi-\ncient to capture qualitatively equivalent monotonic\nbehaviour.\nResults\nWe apply the procedures as set out in the previous sec-\ntion. For a list of parameter values used, see Table 1. Con-\nsider first the model under normal serum pH (hX = 0), as\ndescribed in previous work [17]. Fig. 1 shows the tempo-\nral evolution of a typical cellular automaton. Initially, nor-\nmal epithelial cells (grey) line the basement membrane\n(a). Acquisition of the hyperplastic phenotype (pink)\nallows growth away from the membrane towards the oxy-\ngen diffusion limit (b). Beyond this point, cells cannot\nexist as the oxygen levels are insufficient to meet cellular\nATP demands. This drives adaptation to a glycolytic phe-\nnotype (green), less reliant on oxygen for ATP production\n(c). The increased ATP levels within glycolytic cells give a\ncompetitive advantage over the existing population, thus\nglycolytic cells dominate the system. Note, however, that\nthe total number of cells within the system has decreased;\nthe increased reliance on glycolysis has resulted in higher\nlevels of acidity, in turn inducing cell death. Further adap-\ntation occurs to an acid-resistant phenotype (d).\nIncreased use of glycolysis allows growth well beyond the\noxygen diffusion limit, whilst the cells are more resistant\nto the resulting acidosis.\nIt is interesting to note that throughout the simulations\nperformed, the heritable changes within the dominant\npopulation are accumulated in this same order. Within\nour model, the underlying environmental selection\nparameters drive the cells to always follow this adaptive\npathway - escaping in turn from the constraints of limited\nproliferation (hyperplasia), substrate availability (glycoly-\nsis) and waste removal (acid-resistance). The same order\nof progression occurs despite allowing phenotypic revers-\nibility within our model. This means mutations are not a\nnecessary mechanism for phenotypic variation within\ntumour tissue; rather the model demonstrates that\nreversible, epigenetic changes are sufficient to drive\nglobal change. Of course reversibility in not necessary to\nobserve this adaptation; if irreversible, we would see the\nsame phenotype emerge on a slightly shorter time-scale.\nWe now move on to investigate the effect of altering\nserum pH. In order to examine the effects of parameter\nchanges on system dynamics, we define a measure of the\n'fitness' of a specific parameter set. Let 'invasive' be used to\ndescribe cells displaying all three heritable changes -\nhyperplasia, glycolysis and acid resistance. For a particular\nautomaton, let T denote the number of generations after\nwhich 95% of the cells in the system display the invasive\nphenotype; thus T is representative of the amount of time\ntaken for full carcinogenesis to occur. Now let the develop-\nment rate R = T -1, where we take R = 0 if T \u2265 5000 (equiva-\nlent to approximately 20 years) - i.e. assume no\ncarcinogenesis occurs. Automata with a higher value of R\nproceed more quickly through the carcinogenesis pathway.\np p( ) ( ) .t t= \u2212 \u22121 1 0 (10)\nTable 1: List of non-dimensional parameter values. \nParameter Value\nN 50\nn 5.6 \u00d7 10-2\nk 10\ndg 1.3 \u00d7 102\ndc 5\na0 0.1\nhN 9.3 \u00d7 102\nhT 8.6 \u00d7 103\npa 10-3\nhX 0 or 400\nTaken from an earlier work [17], in which the dimensional \nanalogues, references and justifications are also presented.\nFigure 1 Automaton evolution.

Biology Direct 2010, 5:22\nhttp:\/\/www.biology-direct.com\/content\/5\/1\/22\nPage 5 of 8In Fig. 2(a) we see how the development rate R varies\nwith changes in serum acidity hX. We vary the external\nacid levels from hX = 0 (normal) to hX ~1000, equivalent\nto pH 6.8, corresponding to the threshold for normal cell\nsurvival [16]. Decreases in pHe of this magnitude have\nbeen observed in various human cancers [18]. Note that a\nlog scale is used. Development rate R remains fairly con-\nstant until h ~ 100 (a drop of around 0.1 pH units), when a\nmarked decrease is observed. Looking further however,\nwe see (Fig. 2(b)) that this result follows simply because\nthe harsher conditions lead to death of the entire epithe-\nlium; normal cells die out before having the opportunity\nto turn cancerous.\nSince the model predicts that permanent acidosis can-\nnot arrest cancer development, we move on to investigate\ntransient acidosis, allowing the system to spend a certain\nproportion of time at high acidity and a certain propor-\ntion at normal acidity; this transient acidosis mimics\nwhat occurs when engaging in rigorous exercise followed\nby rest. In Fig. 3(a) we see how the development rate R\nvaries with the amount of time exercising. We see that\nonly a small proportion of time spent at low pH (h = 400,\na drop of around 0.25 pH units) leads to a significant\nreduction in R. By contrast to the previous figure, the\nbehaviour is not due to total epithelial death (Fig. 3(b)).\nGiven the discrete and stochastic nature of this model it\nis not possible to do a complete sensitivity analysis to\ndetermine robustness of behaviour to changes in parame-\nter values. However, results from our earlier work [17]\nshow that small changes in parameter values do not\nmarkedly change system dynamics. However, that study\ndid indicate that increases in glycolytic rate k and adapta-\ntion rate pa will generally increase the rate of cancer\ndevelopment, whilst small changes in acid resistance hT\nhave little effect.\nFigure 2 Effect of sustained acidosis.

This hypothesis\nwill be explored further with a detailed study of the\nmodel.\nDiscussion\nBreast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death\namong women in the United States. In 2005, 186,000\nwomen were diagnosed with breast cancer and 41,000\ndied of the disease. There are a number of factors that\nboth increase and decrease the risk of breast cancer.\nIncreased physical activity appears to be one of the most\nconsistent and effective strategies for breast cancer pre-\nvention. Women who exercise regularly can reduce their\nbreast cancer risk by about 50%. The mechanism of can-\ncer protection is unknown although many hypotheses\nexist including exercise-induced alteration of ovarian\nfunction, weight reduction, or improved immune status.\nRecently the authors have proposed that evolution of\nbreast cancer is substantially influenced by regional\ndevelopment of acidosis and hypoxia within ductal carci-\nnoma in situ (DCIS). As outlined above, cellular adapta-\ntions to these microenvironmental selection forces result\nin a phenotype that possesses constitutively upregulated\nglycolysis and resistance to acid-mediated toxicity. This\npopulation has a profound proliferative advantage\nbecause it can create an acidic microenvironment\n(through upregulated glycolysis) that is toxic to its com-\npetitors but not its own cells.\nThis model of carcinogenesis suggested an alternative\nhypothesis for the observed benefit in reducing breast\ncancer risk. Our hypothesis is based on observations that\neven moderate exercise can produce significant reduction\nin blood pH. Thus, we propose that repeated, transient\nreductions in blood pH due to regular exercise will alter\nthe microenvironmental dynamics of DCIS and that this\nwill be sufficient to prevent or delay its final transition to\ninvasive phenotype.\nTo examine the feasibility of this hypothesis we use a\nhybrid discrete cell-based approach to model the evolu-\ntionary dynamics of carcinogenesis. The multistep pro-\ncess of carcinogenesis is often described as \"somatic\nevolution\" because it appears formally analogous to Dar-\nwinian processes wherein phenotypic properties are\nretained or lost depending on their contribution to indi-\nvidual fitness. According to this model, traits found in\ninvasive cancers must arise as adaptive mechanisms to\nenvironmental proliferative constraints during carcino-\ngenesis. In the model presented here we focus on the role\nof regional variations in microenvironmental selection\nforces due to decreasing oxygen and glucose concentra-\ntions and increasing H+ concentrations that occur with\nincreasing distance from the basement membrane. Car-\ncinogenesis is simplified because mutations in oncogenes\nand tumour suppressor genes, which constitute multiple\nindependent steps, are lumped into a single proliferation\nterm. Furthermore, we assume a 2D spatial configuration\nwhile the true anatomy of a breast duct is a 3D tube-like\nstructure. Nevertheless, we feel that the modified CA\nmodel is sufficient to estimate the effects of transient sys-\ntemic acidosis in the microenvironmental substrate\/\nmetabolite concentrations and phenotypic evolution of\nductal carcinoma in situ.\nIn comparison to earlier modelling work, we have\nintroduced transient, oscillatory behaviour to mimic the\neffects of regular exercise. Differences between sustained\n(Fig. 2) and transient (Fig. 3) acidosis are marked; the\nresults of our initial modelling suggest that repeated tran-\nsient reductions in intra-tumoral pHe will produce signif-\nicant effects in the evolutionary dynamics of DCIS. It\nremains to be shown that transient decreases in blood pH\nwould decrease the pHe of in situ cancers. If this is the\ncase, then our results indicate that the reduction in the\nincidence of breast cancer in women who undertake\nincreased physical activity could be the result of transient\nacidosis that increases the time required for DCIS to\nprogress to invasive cancer. Based on this we conclude\nthat additional investigation is warranted.\nReviewers' comments\nNatalia Komarova - \nkomarova@math.uci.edu\n\"Episodic, transient systemic acidosis delays evolution\nof the malignant phenotype: Possible mechanism for can-\ncer prevention by increased physical activity\", describes a\nnew mechanism by which exercise can reduce the risk of\ncancer. The author's hypothesis is that exercise increases\n(temporarily) the cellular acidity level, and this leads to a\nreduction in the rate of carcinogenesis. Numerical simu-\nlations based on a hybrid cancer model demonstrate this\neffect.\nThe paper is very well written, the idea is novel and\ninteresting (although I am absolutely not qualified to\ncomment on the biological effects of physical activity and\nits connection with the extracellular acidity level). The\neffect described by the authors is striking: if the acidity\nlevel is reduced permanently, this does not decrease the\ncarcinogenesis rate (up to a point, where all cells die\nbecause of the acidity). However, if the acidity level is\nraised transiently, there is a significant reduction of car-\ncinogenesis level (and there is even a nice optimal\namount of transient acidosis, after which things get worse\nagain!).\nThe authors state that at this moment they do not have\na theory of this effect. Creating such a theory (or an intui-\ntive explanation) may be a difficult task. However, to\nmake the present paper with preliminary results more\nSmallbone et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:22\nhttp:\/\/www.biology-direct.com\/content\/5\/1\/22\nPage 7 of 8complete, I would suggest to perform some sort of a\nrobustness test. What is the observed phenomenon holds\nonly for the one parameter combination which was\nexplored? How does it change with parameters? Which\nparameters is it most sensitive to? Apart from making the\npresent paper more convincing, this could indicate the\nmechanism responsible for the observed behavior.\nTo conclude, I think this is a very interesting paper and\nit should definitely be published, once the authors include\na robustness\/sensitivity analysis of their findings.\nResponse\n\u2022 Suggests that we perform a robustness\/sensitivity\nanalysis of our findings.\nGiven the discrete and stochastic nature of this model\nit is impossible to do a complete sensitivity analysis.\nWe do, however, now comment on the effect of\nparameter changes in the manuscript.\nHeiko Enderling - \nheiko.enderling@tufts.edu\nThe authors present a very interesting hypothesis to\nexplain how physical activity can prevent cancer develop-\nment. The study is based on a verified model of somatic\nevolution of malignant cell phenotypes in a breast duct.\nOne rate-limiting step in the carcinogenesis step is adap-\ntation to acidosis - an increased level of acidity due to\nincreased glucose consumption as oxygen delivery\ndecreases. The authors introduce increased transient\nacidity as a consequence of physical activity, which in\nturn triggers additional cell death. Simulation results\nshow that permanent levels of high acidosis prevent\ntumor development because normal epithelium dies\nbefore cancer can develop. In contrast, transient acidity,\nas for example a result of physical activity, decreases\ntumor development rates without destroying normal\ncells. The simple model supports the proposed hypothe-\nsis that transient systemic acidosis can prevent cancer,\nand the authors correctly point out that further research\nis necessary to identify the underlying mechanisms.\nSuggestions:\n\u2022 Is the reversibility of phenotypic changes necessary\nto observe the discussed dynamics? How does the\nsystem behave if carcinogenic events are irreversible?\n\u2022 Figure 3 shows interesting tumor development rates\nas a function of exercising time. Elaborate on the non-\nmonotonic behavior: why does cancer development\ndecrease as time approaches 0.5, followed by an\nincrease in development rate up to 0.9?\n\u2022 Weaken the last paragraph of the discussion. \"results\n... indicate that transient systemic acidosis will pro-\nduce significant effects in the microenvironment...\".\nTwo of the biological questions raised in the back-\nground section (p.4) are: \"do transient blood pH\ndecrease the pHe of in situ cancers\" and \"are intratu-\nmoral pHe dependent on the blood pH value\"? these\nquestions are not answered in this study, and the\nresults do not indicate a change in the environment.\nThe model assumes that there will be a systemic\nchange, and hence the evolutionary dynamics are per-\nturbed. Revise.\nResponse\n\u2022 Questions whether reversibility is necessary to\nobserve these dynamics.\nWe have added a comment on this point to the manu-\nscript.\n\u2022 Asks why figure 3 shows this non-monotonic behav-\niour.\nIt is not clear why there is a non-monotonic response.\nThe reason is likely very complex and we would not\nlike to speculate in the manuscript itself, rather the\nquestion will be pursued in further work.\n\u2022 Suggests we weaken the conclusions drawn in the\nfinal paragraph.\nWe agree with the suggestion, the paragraph now\ndraws a relationship between dynamics and pHe,\nrather than serum pH as originally stated.\nMark Little - \nmark.little@imperial.ac.uk\nGeneral comments\nThis is a generally well-written paper, describing a\nschematic 2D breast cancer model that is used to predict\nthe effects of exercise-induced acidosis. My only major\ncomment is that the parameters used (Table 1) appear to\nbe arbitrary. In particular, to take seriously the predic-\ntions made by the model it would be good to know just\nhow tumour cell fitness varies with acidosis.\nSpecific comments\nIs a pH change of this magnitude (6.8) plausible? pH is\nphysiologically very tightly regulated, and I suspect one\nwould very rarely see pH at this level.\nResponse\n\u2022 Queries the parameter values used in Table 1.\nWe now provide a reference in which their prove-\nnance is described.\n\u2022 Asks if an extracellular pH of 6.8 is (physiologically)\nreasonable.\nReferences are given for both use of this threshold\nand its physiological relevance.\nYang Kuang - \nkuang@asu.edu\nThis is a very interesting and timely paper. The authors\nargue that their results indicate that the reduction in the\nincidence of breast cancer in women who undertake\nincreased physical activity could be the result of transient\nacidosis that increases the time required for ductal carci-\nnoma in situ (DCIS) to progress to invasive cancer. It is a\ncontinuation of the authors' recent work [7,14].\nTo make it more readable, it will be helpful if the\nauthors can provide references to support some of their\nkey statements. For examples, in the second paragraph of\nSmallbone et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:22\nhttp:\/\/www.biology-direct.com\/content\/5\/1\/22\nPage 8 of 8background section, the authors stated that using mathe-\nmatical models, in vitro experiments, and clinical obser-\nvations, it has been shown that proliferation of in situ\ncancers carries the cells further away from the basement\nmembrane and, therefore, increasingly distant from the\nunderlying blood supply. It will be necessary to provide\nreferences for the mentioned mathematical models, in\nvitro experiments, and clinical observations. Similarly,\nreferences are needed to support other statements in that\nparagraph (The consequent upregulation of glycolysis\ncombined with long diffusion distances for metabolites\nproduces marked acidosis in the hypoxic regions (need\nrefs). It has been proposed that adaptation to hypoxia is\ncritical in emergence of the malignant phenotype because\nthe combination of adaptations with upregulation of glyc-\nolytic metabolism and resistance to acid-mediated toxic-\nity confers a profound proliferative advantage (need\nrefs)).\nIn particular, even though the authors may have sub-\nstantiated their model assumptions elsewhere, the\nauthors shall at least cite references to explain their\nmodel (1)-(9) assumptions and presenting some mini-\nmum model formulation details. It is also necessary to\nexplain the estimation and\/or selection of their model\nparameter values. Table 1 lists model non-dimensional\nparameter values. It will be useful if the authors can\ninclude the parameter units. It will also be helpful if the\nauthors can comment on how much readers shall read\ninto their results given that they are generated from a\nmodel with a single set of ad hoc parameter values.\nMore naturally, the authors may want to compare their\nnew model dynamics with their earlier results [7,14] or\nhighlight the differences and explain the importance of\nsuch differences.\nResponse\n\u2022 Requests more references to support statements on\nprevious (modelling, experimental and clinical) work.\nNew references have been included as suggested.\n\u2022 Asks for further justification of model formulation\nand results.\nWe have expanded points of the methods section to\nclarify and justify modelling assumptions.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nKS performed the simulations.
