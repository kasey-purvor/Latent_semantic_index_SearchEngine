By definition, internally displaced persons are\n\u2018\u2018persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave\ntheir homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of, or in order\nto avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations\nof human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed\nan internationally recognized State border\u2019\u2019.1\nInternational initiatives towards improving the welfare of internally displaced\npersons appeared to stagnate in the late 1990s, after the appointment of the\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary General on Internally Displaced\nPersons,2 the formulation of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement\nin 1998,3 and the consequent establishment of the Inter-Agency Standing\nCommittee on Internally Displaced Persons.4\nHowever, major legal developments concerning the protection of internally\ndisplaced persons are currently unfolding in the African Union (AU) as well as in\nthe Great Lakes region of East, Central, and Southern Africa. These developments\ncoincide with the recent opinions issued by the International Court of Justice and\ndecisions rendered by regional human rights bodies in Africa, Europe and the\nInter-Americas, which have shed further light on state responsibility for internally\ndisplaced persons. State practice is also crystallizing, with states such as Angola,\nColumbia, Georgia, Peru and Uganda articulating national legal and policy\nframeworks for the protection and assistance of internally displaced persons.\n* Senior Lecturer in International Law, London School of Economics and Political Science. The\nauthor prepared a legal framework for the protection and assistance of internally displaced persons on\nbehalf of the African Union in 2006. The legal framework was approved and enriched by the experts\nof the African Union and its cooperating partners in Addis Ababa in April 2006. The ambassadors\nand ministers of the African Union endorsed the legal framework in Ouagadougou in May 2006. The\nauthor is currently drafting the African Union\u2019s Convention on the Protection and Assistance of\nInternally Displaced Persons for consideration by the African Union in January 2007. He has also\ndrafted the Protocol on the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons on behalf of the\nGreat Lakes states; this Protocol is awaiting adoption by the heads of states later in 2006. In preparing\nthis article, great care has been taken to avoid breaching the confidentiality of both of these processes.\nThe views expressed in this article are exclusively those of the author in his personal and academic\ncapacity.\n1 United Nations, Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, E\/CN.4\/1998\/53\/Add.2, 11\nFebruary, 1998, para. 2.\n2 Res. 1992\/73, approved by the United Nations Economic and Social Council on 20 July, 1992.\n3 Above n. 1.\n4 Member organizations of the of the Inter-Agency Committee are: Food and Agricultural\nOrganization; Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs; United Nations Children\u2019s Fund;\nUnited Nations Development Programme; Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees; World\nFood Programme; and World Health Organization.

In\nJuly 2004, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)5\nestablished an Inter-Agency Internal Displacement Division in the framework\nof the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) and, as a consequence of the\nreform of the United Nations in 2005, institutional protection for internally\ndisplaced persons has been streamlined by cluster, with the Office of the High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) being assigned responsibility for the\nphysical protection of internally displaced persons in camps or settlements.6\nIn the light of these developments, the focal point of this article rests on\nstandard setting measures initiated by the AU under whose auspices a\nConvention on Internally Displaced Persons is being drafted in the aftermath\nof a Draft Protocol on Protection and Assistance to Internally Displaced\nPersons in the Great Lakes Region, 2006. Both of these have spurred the\nEconomic Association of West African States (ECOWAS) to consider a legal\nframework for protecting internally displaced persons as well, although this\nlatter effort may be overtaken by the AU\u2019s decision to elaborate a detailed and\ncomprehensive continental instrument that will effectively meet the concerns of\nECOWAS.\nTo this end, the article first highlights the historical commitment of the AU to\naddressing the problem of displacement in Africa. It then indicates the lacunae in\nthe legal arrangements for the protection and assistance of internally displaced\npersons in Africa. Finally, the article presents the parameters of a draft legal\nframework for the protection and assistance of internally displaced persons in\nAfrica, which was endorsed in successive stages by an expert group of the AU,\nthe cooperating partners of the AU, and the ambassadors and ministers of the\nAU responsible for refugees and internally displaced persons.\nSCOPE OF THE PROBLEM\nJudicious observers have pointed out that the nature of forced displacement on\nthe African continent and the institutional responses of the continental\norganization, i.e., the AU, to this phenomenon have changed over time, from\na historical focus on refugees to encompassing internally displaced persons.7 One\nof the luminary signals of this change was the outcome of a high level joint\nsymposium of the then Organization of African Unity (OAU, now the African\nUnion or AU) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which\nwas held in 1994 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Convention\nGoverning the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, 1969.8\nThe symposium tritely observed that the situation of internally displaced\npersons typified the crisis of displacement in Africa.9 Of the world\u2019s estimated\n5 Available at: ,http:\/\/ochaonline.un.org\/webpage.asp?Site5idp..\n6 UNHCR, \u2018\u2018Discussion paper on UNHCR\u2019s role in IASC humanitarian reform initiatives and in\nthe strengthening of the inter-agency collaborative response to internally displaced persons\nsituations\u2019\u2019, 20 September, 2005, available at: ,http:\/\/www.unhcr.org\/cgi-bin\/texis\/vtx\/excom\/\nopendoc.pdf?tbl5EXCOM&id543d0dbe32..\n7 P.

These factors call for\nthe formulation of a comprehensive legal framework designed to codify the\nstandards of protection, provide for the means and institutions of protection and\nassistance, and to serve as a legal basis for coordinating various regional and\ninternational actors and agencies involved in providing protection and assistance\nto internally displaced persons in Africa. What is the measure of the political will\nto achieve this?\nAU COMMITMENT\nThe African Union is historically committed to resolving the general problem\nof displacement in Africa. This commitment was originally rooted in the OAU\u2019s\nstruggle against colonialism and was initially more apparent towards refugees.\nThus, the Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in\nAfrica was concluded in 1969, and a Bureau for Refugees was established as part\nof the institutional structure of the OAU.\nIt would appear that the somewhat static provisions of the Charter of the\nOAU, particularly those on non-interference in the affairs of other member\nstates, prevented more robust approaches to the protection and assistance of\ninternally displaced persons. Nonetheless, the commitment of the OAU towards\ninternally displaced persons was evident in its decisions on the situation of\nrefugees, returnees and displaced persons in general.\nThese decisions have been upheld by the African Union, culminating in the\ndecision of its Executive Council in July 2004 to request the Commission of the\nAfrican Union \u2018\u2018to collaborate with relevant cooperating partners and other\nstakeholders to ensure that Internally Displaced Persons are provided with an\nappropriate legal framework to ensure their adequate protection and\nassistance\u2019\u2019.11 Institutionally, the AU has created the Division of Humanitarian\nAffairs, Refugees and Displaced Persons. Its profile goes beyond that of the\nprevious Bureau for Refugees under the then OAU, and its mandate is central to\nworking out an appropriate legal framework for the protection and assistance of\ninternally displaced persons. The \u2018\u2018Division is the line operational unit of the AU\nCommission and acts as a Secretariat to all the organs on forced displacement\nmatters\u2019\u2019.12\nIn principle, the commitment of the African Union to address the plight of\ninternally displaced persons is inherent in its founding legal instruments. One of\nthe purposes of its predecessor, the OAU, was to coordinate and intensify the\ncooperation and efforts of African States to achieve a better life for the people of\n10 See UNHCR, The State of the World\u2019s Refugees, Geneva, 2006, ch. 7 \u2018\u2018Internally displaced\npersons\u2019\u2019, available at: ,http:\/\/www.unhcr.org\/cgi-bin\/texis\/vtx\/publ\/opendoc.htm?tbl5\nPUBL&id54444d3cc11..\n11 African Union, Decision on the Situation of Refugees, Returnees and Displaced Persons,\nExecutive Council Decision EX\/CL\/Dec.127.\n12 Tigere and Amukhobu, above n. 7, 53.\nVol. 50, No. 2 Recent Developments 189\nAfrica.13 However, it is the principles of the Constitutive Act, 2000, of the\nAfrican Union,14 which establish obligations that are more conducive to the\nprotection of internally displaced persons. Amongst these are the promotion and\nprotection of human and peoples\u2019 rights in accordance with the African Charter\non Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and other relevant instruments (article 3(h)), and\nthe promotion of cooperation in all fields of human activity to raise the living\nstandards of African peoples (article 3(k)).\nIt is arguable that the objectives of the Union establish a stronger legal\nfoundation that can be tilted towards protecting and assisting internally displaced\npersons. These include: the right of the Union to intervene in a member state\u2019s\naffairs pursuant to a decision reached by the Assembly in respect of grave\ncircumstances, namely war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity\n(article 4(h)); the right of a member state to request intervention from the Union\nin order to restore peace and security (article 4(j)); and respect for the sanctity of\nhuman life and the rejection of impunity, amongst other things (article 4(o)).\nLeaving aside the founding instruments of the OAU and the AU, the\ncommitment of the African Union towards the protection of internally displaced\npersons should be situated in the broader context of the international obligations\nconcerning international cooperation. The reason for doing so is that, within its\nobjectives, the Constitutive Act of the African Union encourages international\ncooperation, taking due account of the Charter of the United Nations, 1945, and\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948. The Charter of the United\nNations enshrines the principle of international cooperation in solving problems\nof a humanitarian nature, and the protection of internally displaced persons is a\nprime example of such a problem. Efforts undertaken by the United Nations to\ntackle the problem of the protection of internally displaced persons also reflect\nthe commitment of member states of the African Union in their capacity as\nmember states of the United Nations. These efforts are epitomized by the work\nof the Special Representative of the Secretary General on Internally Displaced\nPersons, formerly Dr. Francis Deng, and currently Professor Walter Kalin. A\nkey recommendation of the joint AU and UNHCR symposium in 1994 was to\ngive strong support to the efforts of the Special Representative on Inter-\nnally Displaced Persons, and initiatives taken in other national, regional and\ninternational fora, to promote appropriate legal, institutional and operational\nmechanisms for the better protection and assistance of internally displaced\npersons.\nLACUNAE IN PROTECTION AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE\nWhile the framework of the Constitutive Act of the African Union is conducive\nto the protection of internally displaced persons, the Union does not have a specific\nlegal instrument for protecting and assisting internally displaced persons. This\nmajor lacunae poses an imbalance in the African Union\u2019s commitment to resolve\nthe problems of internally displaced persons, considering that at least a legal\nframework exists for the protection of refugees in Africa. The Addis Ababa\ndocument highlighted this gap whilst emphasizing the responsibilities of African\nstates to protect internally displaced persons as their own nationals.\nAttempts at filling the lacunae of a legal instrument for internally displaced\npersons in Africa must draw on wider aspects of the efforts made so far. The\n13 Art. II(b), Charter of the Organization of African Unity, 1963.\n14 Constitutive Act of the African Union, 11 July, 2000, CAB\/LEG 23.15.\n190 Recent Developments [2006] J.A.L.\ninitiative for these efforts arose first from the decision of the United Nations to\nreview its capacity for delivering assistance to refugees and internally displaced\npersons in the early 1990s. A notable precursor was the decision of the Economic\nand Social Council of the United Nations on 27 July, 1990,15 in which the\nSecretary General of the United Nations was requested to make a wide ranging\nreview of the capacity and experience of the United Nations in coordinating the\ndelivery of assistance to refugees and internally displaced persons. The Secretary\nGeneral was also asked to recommend ways of maximizing co-operation and\ncoordination among the various organs of the United Nations system in response\nto the problems of refugees, displaced persons and returnees.16\nAs part of this review, the Commission for Human Rights invited the\nSecretary General to consider the protection of human rights in the context of\ninternally displaced persons and to submit to the Commission an analytical\nreport on this issue.17 Consequently, at its 48th session in 1992, the Human\nRights Commission included an item on its agenda for submissions by United\nNations agencies, NGOs and others, with respect to the protection of internally\ndisplaced persons. The Commission duly received the Analytical Report of the\nSecretary-General on Internally Displaced Persons entitled Alternative Approaches\nand Ways and Means within the United Nations System for Improving the Effective Enjoyment\nof Human Rights.18 This had the effect of placing the protection of internally\ndisplaced persons within the framework of human rights.\nThe momentum generated by the effort of the Secretary General led to the\nappointment of Dr. Francis Deng as a Special Representative of the Secretary\nGeneral on Internally Displaced Persons in 1992.19 The Special Representative\nwas requested to examine existing international standards of human rights,\nhumanitarian and refugee law, and their application to the protection of\ninternally displaced persons. Dr. Deng\u2019s work identified existing \u2018\u2018gaps\u2019\u2019 in the\nlaw with respect to internally displaced persons,20 and compiled the relevant\ninternational instruments applicable to the protection of internally displaced\npersons.21 This work coincided with the first ever monograph written on the\nsubject of the protection of internally displaced persons in international law.22\nThe monograph provided the basis for the definition of internally displaced\npersons and examined the substantive application of human rights and\nhumanitarian law to the situation of internally displaced persons. It showed\nthat the gaps were artificial and that they resulted from a lack of effort to\nsynthesize the interplay between refugee law, human rights and international\nhumanitarian law.\nIn addition, the former Special Rapporteur on Population Transfers, Dr. Al-\nKhasawneh, now Judge of the International Court of Justice, issued his report on\nHuman Rights and Population Transfer (1994 and 1997),23 which laid out the\n15 Res. 1990\/78, 27 July, 1990.\n16 Report of the Secretary General on the Review of the Capacity, Experience and Coordination Arrangements in the\nUnited Nations system for Humanitarian Assistance, UN doc.

These addressed the gaps identified\nin Dr. Deng\u2019s earlier report by combining as a whole the relevant standards of\ninternational refugee law, international human rights law, and international\nhumanitarian law. Member states of the United Nations approved the use of\nthese principles in the Outcome Report of the United Nations, 2005.\nToday, the Guiding Principles stand out as the most authentic basis for\nproviding protection and assistance to internally displaced persons. The greatest\nachievement underscored by the Guiding Principles is the internationalization of\nthe internal situation of displaced persons by bringing together the broad\nprinciples of international human rights and international humanitarian law\napplicable especially to persons displaced within states. United Nations member\nstates recognized the Guiding Principles as \u2018\u2018an important international\nframework for the protection of internally displaced persons and resolve to take\neffective measures to increase the protection of internally displaced persons\u2019\u2019.24\nDespite this high powered exhortation, the Guiding Principles do not by\nthemselves establish binding obligations. For this reason, the approach taken by\nthe member states of the International Conference on the Great Lakes25 with\nrespect to the protection and assistance of internally displaced persons was to\ndevise a legal framework for the adoption and implementation of the Guiding\nPrinciples.26 The Great Lakes Protocol represents a specific development that\nbegins to address the lacunae of a legal framework aimed at protecting and\nassisting internally displaced persons. It establishes the scope of the responsibility\nof states for the protection of internally displaced persons; outlines the applicable\nprinciples of protection and assistance; and lays out obligations for the member\nstates of the International Conference on the Great Lakes to adopt and\nimplement the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. However, it awaits\nadoption by the heads of states of the Great Lakes Region later in 2006. Its scope\nof application is limited to the Great Lakes region, and its substantive content\nalso reflects the realities of that region since it was designed to provide a\nframework for adopting and implementing the Guiding Principles.\nBoth the Great Lakes Protocol and the adoption of a decision by the African\nUnion to elaborate a legal instrument on internally displaced persons show that\nthe political will and climate exist to forge ahead with the protection of internally\ndisplaced persons in Africa. A number of reasons account for this. States of origin\nrecognize that large numbers of displaced persons within their territories without\nprotection and assistance ferment public disorder and internal instability. The\nvulnerability of internally displaced persons opens them up to manipulation and\npossible recruitment, or infiltration, by armed groups fighting against such states.\nAs a result, there is a desire on the part of the states of origin to exercise control\nover internally displaced persons either for reasons related to their displacement\nor for the reasons of internal armed conflict. These interests coincide with those\n24 GA Res.\/60\/1, 2005 World Summit Outcome, 24 October, 2005, para. 132, available at:,http:\/\/\ndaccessdds.un.org\/doc\/UNDOC\/GEN\/N05\/487\/60\/PDF\/N0548760.pdf?OpenElement..\n25 The core member states are: Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo,\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, The Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.\n26 Draft Protocol on the Protection and Assistance to Internally Displaced Persons, 2006.

Neighbouring states that host sizeable numbers of\nrefugees envisage the protection of internally displaced persons as one way of\nreducing their burden or responsibility in the absence of a regional or\ninternational system of burden sharing. There is also a view, which is the\ndubious opposite of the practice of alternative internal flight, that a system of\nprotecting and assisting internally displaced persons will contribute to the\npromotion of the \u2018\u2018durable solution\u2019\u2019 of voluntary repatriation or the safe return\nof refugees from the territories of the host states to the states of origin.\nWhatever the propriety of these factors, it seems that a principled pan-African\nlegal framework for the protection and assistance of internally displaced persons\nmust bear on the definition of internally displaced persons as laid out in the\nGuiding Principles. It should also draw on the strands of law corresponding to\nthe categories of internally displaced persons and on which the Guiding\nprinciples are based, taking into account, as stated in the introduction, the recent\nand relevant jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, the African\nCommission, the Inter-American system, and the European Court of Human\nRights.\nThe jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice has laid out the\napplication of human rights and international humanitarian law in situations of\narmed conflict, occupation and the obligations that arise from occupation,27\nwhich are of prime importance to the protection of internally displaced persons\nby states, armed groups and non-state actors. The African Commission has held\nthat displacement is unlawful and that it constitutes a breach of freedom of\nmovement and residence as well as the right to peace and security. Mauritania\u2019s\nresponsibility for failing to prevent the forced eviction of persons by armed\ngroups acting on its territory was upheld by the African Commission.28\nThe Inter-American Court has taken a similar but far more incisive approach,\nupholding the legal responsibility of Columbia for massacres and acts of\ndisplacement caused by paramilitary or armed groups on the basis of Columbia\u2019s\nfailure to act promptly to prevent displacement and create the necessary\nconditions for displaced persons to return to their homes in safety. It also\nendorsed the importance of freedom of movement as a standard for providing\nprotection against forced displacement.29 The European Court of Human Rights\nhas affirmed the protection of displaced persons, as civilians, fleeing Russian\nmilitary operations in Chechnya, and that the killing of such civilians by Russian\narmed forces breached its obligation to protect the right to life under the\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights.30\nThese decisions show that the phenomenon of displacement is spread widely,\nengaging human rights protection mechanisms in Africa, Europe and Latin\nAmerica. Above all, the decisions illustrate the variety of contexts in which the\nneed for the protection of internally displaced persons and the accompanying\nresponsibilities for states arise. While decisions by human rights bodies elucidate\nthe law and point to the role of these bodies in protecting persons displaced\nwithin states, such protection is always likely to be patchy and cannot effectively\nrespond to the protection and assistance needed by millions of displaced persons.\nThe case to be made is that riding on the back of such significant decisions\nby human rights bodies, the legal framework for the protection of internally\n27 Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, 8 July, 1996; Legal Consequences of\nthe Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Advisory Opinion, 9 July, 2004; Armed activities\non the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

It should establish institutional machinery for coordinating\nprotection and assistance to internally displaced persons in Africa. It should\nfurther provide a means for assistance and for monitoring such protection as\nwell as for ensuring compliance by the member states. Careful consideration\nshould be given in this regard to the African legal experts\u2019 recommendation\nthat a high level office within the African Union be established for this\npurpose.\nOUTLINING AN AU LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS\nThe outline presented here sets out the proposed structure and content of an\nAfrican Union Legal Framework on Internally Displaced Persons. The outline\nis based on the legal premises of state responsibility for the protection and\nassistance of internally displaced persons. Its content draws on the existing and\napplicable branches of human rights and international humanitarian law, and\nsynthesizes these whilst seeking to incorporate directly, where relevant, aspects of\nthe Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.\nThis approach, and the proposed structure and content of the outline, were\ndiscussed, enhanced and endorsed by an African Union expert group on\nInternally Displaced Persons and the cooperating partners of the African Union\nin Addis Ababa on 11\u201313 April, 2006.31 The ambassadors and ministers of the\nAfrican Union approved the framework at their meeting in Ouagadougou, held\n29 May\u20132 June, 2006, and recommended that a draft Convention on the\nProtection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons be prepared and\npresented for consideration and adoption by African heads of states in January\n2007. For this and other reasons of confidentiality, details of the full content of\nthe framework are omitted.\nThe proposed structure and content is laid out in 13 parts. At the outset, a\nPreamble lays out the legal, political, and philosophical basis on which the\nproposed Convention is to be based. It also underlies the motive, concern and\ninspiration of the legal framework underlying the proposed Convention. Part\nOne consists of the essential definitions that will be used throughout the\nproposed Convention. Use will be made of the widely accepted definitions of\ninternally displaced persons and arbitrary displacement, which are contained in\nthe Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. However, the definition of\ninternally displaced persons will not be treated as warranting a status; it is a\ndescription of displacement according to the affected categories of displaced\npersons, and some of these correspond to existing aspects of international law\nthat are applicable to internally displaced persons. It will be necessary in this part\nto clarify the terms used in the definition of internally displaced persons by\nreference to international humanitarian law, the law of human rights, and where\napplicable, the Annotations to the Guiding Principles. The stated purpose is to\ncontextualize the definition in the special circumstances of the phenomenon of\ninternal displacement in Africa.\n31 The author acknowledges the usefulness of the comments and ideas provided by the African\nUnion expert group and the cooperating partners of the African Union.\n194 Recent Developments [2006] J.A.L.\nThe objectives of the Convention will appear in Part Two. It is common\nground that under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969,32 such\nobjectives are significant to the interpretation and application of a treaty,\ntogether with the Preamble. Some of the major objectives of the proposed\nConvention are to: establish a legal framework for protecting and assisting\ninternally displaced persons in Africa; create an appropriate institutional\nframework to respond to situations of displacement; prevent arbitrary\ndisplacement; and eliminate the root causes of displacement as well as searching\nfor durable solutions to the problem of internally displaced persons. At their\nmeeting in Ouagadougou, the ministers resolutely affirmed \u2018\u2018zero\u2019\u2019 tolerance for\nrefugees and internally displaced persons in Africa and called upon member\nstates to achieve this objective.\nPart three of the proposed Convention seeks to chart the legal principles on\nwhich the Convention will be based. Foremost amongst these are the obligations\nof states to prevent and prohibit displacement; to suppress or repress acts of\ndisplacement by non-state actors within the jurisdiction of states; and to maintain\nthe civilian and humanitarian character of the protection and assistance of\ninternally displaced persons. The prohibition of arbitrary displacement will be\ncovered in Part Four, based on the standards of international humanitarian law\nand the law of human rights which prohibit displacement in general and also\nallow exceptions in certain situations in which displacement may take place.\nThere will be particular regard for the prohibition of arbitrary displacement\naccording to the categories of persons displaced internally by: (a) armed conflict;\n(b) generalized violence; (c) violations, denial, neglect of human rights; (d)\ndevelopment induced displacement and displacement induced by lack of\ndevelopment; (e) natural or man-made disasters or factors; (e) any act, event,\nfactor, or phenomenon of comparable gravity;\nIn Part Five, the framework of the proposed Convention will provide for\nresponsibility for protection, assistance, and solutions. The basic idea is to\ndelineate the quantum of the responsibilities for providing protection and\nassistance and for working out solutions to the problem of internally displaced\npersons. States bear the burden of these responsibilities under international law.\nHowever, some of the responsibilities are owed jointly between states and non-\nstate actors. Accordingly, this part will determine the responsibilities of states,\nother entities, and armed groups towards the protection and assistance of\ninternally displaced persons.\nPart Six will make provision for the principles concerning protection during\ndisplacement. These derive mainly from the international legal standards which\nprohibit the displacement of the civilian population during armed conflict as well\nas the prohibited methods or acts of causing displacement, drawing on a\nsynthesis of the standards of international humanitarian law and human rights,\nwhere applicable. It is proposed to link these principles to the framework of the\nConstitutive Act of the African Union, in particular, the right of the African\nUnion, under the Constitutive Act to intervene in the territory of a member state\nin order to protect and assist internally displaced persons; and the right of a\nmember state to request the African Union, under the Constitutive Act, to\nintervene to protect and assist internally displaced persons when such a state is\nunable to do so.\nAn important aspect of the proposed Convention concerns protection and\nassistance in areas of displacement within the states of origin. The arrival and\n32 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 23 March, 1969, 1155 UNTS 331.\nVol. 50, No. 2 Recent Developments 195\nreception of internally displaced persons in such areas is the most critical and\nchallenging phase of protection and assistance. Emergency preparedness and\nskills of disaster management are a key function of protection and assistance. At\nthis stage, the obligations to protect and assist internally displaced persons shall\nnecessarily engage the legal responsibilities of states, international organizations\nor agencies, and other non-state actors. These matters will be dealt with in Part\nSeven of the proposed Convention.\nPart Eight will delve into the aspect of development induced displacement, i.e.,\nsituations where displacement within states is induced by the construction of\nlarge-scale projects and situations where the displacement of persons is induced\nby the lack of development. This phenomenon is both endemic and of\ncomparable gravity, often disguised as rural-urban migration, when in fact\ndesperate livelihood and living conditions compel persons to leave their places of\nresidence and move to areas where their existence is precarious and they are\nvulnerable to forced removals or evictions. The experts felt that the legal\nframework must address both of these aspects.\nPart Nine of the framework will address the legal principles governing\nhumanitarian assistance and the institutional structure for the provision of such\nassistance under the African Union. These principles include neutrality,\nimpartiality, and the provision of humanitarian assistance to save the lives and\nhealth of all in need. The framework adopts the expert group\u2019s recommendation\nto establish a high level office comparable in stature to that of the office of a high\ncommissioner. This office will, amongst other functions, act to mobilize\nresources; monitor and coordinate protection and assistance to internally\ndisplaced persons; create institutional links between the African Union and\nrespective national structures of protection and assistance; and liaise with\ninternational organizations and agencies that extend protection and assistance to\ninternally displaced persons.\nIn Part Ten, the framework seeks to project the promotion of return as a\ndurable solution to the problem of displacement. The return of displaced persons\nis an important step towards repairing and healing the past; it must therefore be\npromoted in durable conditions. This calls for protection and assistance during\nthe return, reintegration or relocation, and reinsertion of internally displaced\npersons. Reinsertion is a state of normal existence and belonging, which follows\nafter reintegration or relocation; it marks the point at which the situation of\ndisplacement formally ends. However, the responsibility of the state to protect\nnever formally ends since internally displaced persons are nationals of a state.\nThe quality of protection may change after reinsertion, but protection itself\ncontinues as the responsibility of the state of nationality.\nReparations in the form of restitution or compensation and other forms of\nredress, whether monetary or in kind, are significant to the proposed\nConvention. Such reparations, public acknowledgements of the wrongs per-\npetrated upon internally displaced persons, apologies for such wrongs, and guaran-\ntees of non-repetition of wrongful behaviour by the perpetrators or architects of\ndisplacement go a long way to begin to heal the pain of displacement and help to\nbring about reconciliation between returning persons and those who caused their\nflight in the first place. Part 11 will speak to the issue of reparations for internally\ndisplaced persons.\nPart 12 will embrace monitoring compliance by states of the obligations to be\nset by the proposed Convention. This requirement is an indispensable way of\nsecuring the effective protection and assistance of internally displaced persons by\nthe African Union. Under the framework of the proposed Convention, the key\nresponsibility for this will rest with the high level office to be established under\n196 Recent Developments [2006] J.A.L.\nPart Nine. In this respect, the high level office shall be linked to the existing role\nof the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, particularly to the\noversight work of the Commission\u2019s Rapporteur on Refugees and Internally\nDisplaced Persons.\nThe provisions in Part 13 will provide for matters incidental to the entry into\nforce, and the effect, of the Conventional legal framework on existing obligations\nin human rights and international humanitarian law. Under this part, the\nproposed Convention shall: enter into force upon ratification by 15 member\nstates of the African Union; not be subject to any reservations; be concluded\nwithout prejudice to the human rights of internally displaced persons as specified\nin the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights or elsewhere, particularly\nthe right to seek and enjoy asylum in accordance with the African Charter on\nHuman and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the AU Convention Governing the Specific\nAspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, 1969; not affect the right of internally\ndisplaced persons to lodge complaints before the African Commission on\nHuman and Peoples\u2019 Rights or the African Court on Human and Peoples\u2019\nRights; not in any way be understood, or interpreted, to undermine the\nsubstance or application of international humanitarian law.\nCONCLUSION\nThe steps taken by the African Union to conclude and adopt a Convention on\nthe Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons will lead to a legal\nlandmark in this field of human rights and international humanitarian law.\nAfrica will have scored a first among the regional systems by establishing such a\nframework. However, the Great Lakes region will justifiably claim this accolade,\nhaving concluded a Protocol on the Protection and Assistance to Internally\nDisplaced Persons ahead of the African Union. But, this was largely made\npossible by the absence of any such instrument at the African or international\nlevel. For the realists, the issue goes beyond the matter of accolades and reaches\ndeeply into alleviating the malaise of internally displaced persons in Africa,\nwithout seeking to undermine the protection of those who are compelled to flee\nto other states for safety. Perhaps the developments in Africa will inspire an\ninternational resolve to formulate and adopt such an instrument, if not for the\nworld as a whole, then at least for regions such as Asia and Latin America where\nthe problem of the protection of internally displaced persons poses similar\nchallenges.\nVol. 50, No. 2 Recent Developments 197\n"}
