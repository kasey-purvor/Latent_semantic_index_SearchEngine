The men had been maintained on long-term oestrogen therapy before surgery, to aid the development of secondary feminine characteristics (oestrogen treatments were stopped 6 weeks before surgery). Corpus cavernosum strips were mounted in organ baths perfused with Krebs\u2019 solution. A control concentration-response curve (CRC) to phenylephrine (a nonselective \u03b11-agonist) was obtained. Then the tissues were incubated with the \u03b11A antagonist, WB4101; the \u03b11B antagonist, chloroethylclonidine; or the \u03b11D antagonist BMY 7378 (all at 1 \u00b5M) and the CRC to phenylephrine was repeated. The concentration producing a half-maximal response (EC50) and pKB values (logarithm of the dissociation constant, a measure of affinity) were determined.\\ud\nRESULTS:\\ud\nWB4101 produced a parallel rightward shift of the CRC to phenylephrine, with a pKB of 7.49. BMY 7378 also produced a parallel rightward shift of the CRC to phenylephrine with a pKB of 6.45. Chloroethylclonidine had a similar effect on the phenylephrine CRC, with a pKB of 5.90.\\ud\nCONCLUSION:\\ud\n\u03b11-adrenoceptors in human cavernosal tissue have a relatively low affinity for BMY 7378 and chloroethylclonidine, but are more sensitive to WB4101. This confirms that the predominant \u03b11-adrenoceptor subtype in human corpus cavernosum is the \u03b11A subtype and this might help in developing more selective antagonists and agonists for managing erectile dysfunction and priapism","downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381\/8953<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2011-01-11T13:55:24Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2381_162<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_9550<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_163<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \n\u03b11-Adrenoceptor subtypes in isolated corporal tissue from patients undergoing gender re-assignment<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nEl-Gamal, Osama M.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nSandhu, Davinder P.S.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nTerry, Tim<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nElliott, Ruth A.<\/dc:creator><dc:description>\nThis paper was published as BJU International, 2006, 97 (2), pp. 329-332.
