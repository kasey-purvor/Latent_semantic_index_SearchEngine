Participants of the study were Hungarian learners whose creativity was \nmeasured with a standardised creativity test. We examined the relationships between three \naspects of creativity: originality, flexibility, and creative fluency, and different measures of \ntask performance. \n The findings suggest that the three components of creativity have a differential effect \non the measures of task performance. Creative fluency was positively correlated with the \nquantity of talk.

The magnitude \nof the correlations indicates that creativity affects participants\u2019 output in narrative tasks only \nmoderately.  \n 3 \nIntroduction \n \n Many of the individual differences that exist between learners have been studied in an \nattempt to account for the differential success in second language acquisition. The relevance \nof several cognitive, motivational, personality and social factors has been revealed, but there \nis one complex phenomenon, the importance of which has not been thoroughly explored to \nthis day, and this is learner creativity. If the creative process is regarded as a rare phenomenon \nobservable only in the exceptionally talented, its relevance for the millions of average people \nlearning foreign languages is obviously negligible. If, however, creativity is hypothesised to \nbe a special arrangement of those cognitive, motivational, personality or social characteristics \nthat are present in everyone, its effects on second language acquisition cannot be disregarded. \nA number of researchers (Bark\u00f3czi and Z\u00e9t\u00e9nyi, 1981; Cropley, 1972; Guilford, 1950; \nHarrington, Block, and Block, 1983; Mednick, 1962) believe that the underlying components \nof creativity are normally distributed in the population. Therefore creativity, which implicitly \ninvolves imagination, unconventionality, risk-taking, flexibility, and creating new \nclassifications and systematisations of knowledge (Sternberg, 1985a), might be a factor that \naffects second language acquisition. \n The changing methods of second language instruction, the prominence of methods of \ncommunicative and task-based language teaching, which in many cases employ tasks that \nrequire students to use their imagination, provides another reason why researching this \nvariable should become imminent. Tasks that involve the use of imagination and the \ngeneration of new ideas might provide creative learners with more chance to practise, that is, \nto produce more comprehensible output, which could lead to greater success in second \nlanguage acquisition (Swain, 1985). This might be even more so in a foreign language \nenvironment, where output is mainly produced in the classroom. Support for this line of \nargumentation was provided by Ott\u00f3 (1998), who, in a small-scale study involving Hungarian \nsecondary school learners instructed by communicative methods, found significant positive \ncorrelations between different measures of learner creativity and students\u2019 end-of year English \ngrades.  \n  It is not obvious, however, whether the effects of an individual variable like creativity \ncan only be observed in general outcomes of second or foreign language learning, such as \nachievement as reflected by English grades (Ott\u00f3, 1998) and presumably proficiency test \nresults, or if these effects can also be detected in much smaller and more specific units of \nlearner performance, such as tasks (see Dewaele and Furnham (1999) on the relationship of \n 4 \nextraversion and oral task performance). The research presented in this paper aimed to \ninvestigate the effects of learner creativity on several output variables of one particular task \ntype, the oral narrative task, while controlling for the differences in the participants\u2019 level of \nproficiency. Since oral narrative tasks generally involve storytelling based on some cue, this \ntask type seems to lend an opportunity for learners to use their imagination; therefore, it was \nfound particularly well suited for demonstrating the effects of creativity. This exploratory \nstudy involved 35 Hungarian learners of English and used a correlational design. The initial \nassumption of the research was that creativity enhances the participants\u2019 performance on the \noral narrative task, resulting in both quantitatively and qualitatively superior performance on \nthe output variables examined. \n \nCreativity \n \nWhen trying to define the construct of creativity, the first difficulty encountered is that \nthis concept covers a wide range of distinct but related phenomena: the creative performance \nor product, the creative person, the creative situation, the creative process and the creative \npotential (Brown, 1989; Lubart, 1994). Therefore, when attempting to define this concept, one \nof the first tasks should be restricting the scope of our investigation and specifying the area or \naspect of creativity that is to be examined. This means that for lack of space neither theories \nof the creative process (see Finke, Ward, and Smith, 1992; Hayes, 1989; Wallas, 1970) nor \ntheories for evaluating creative products (see Finke et al., 1992) will be discussed here. \nSimilarly, although theories of personality also address the issue of creativity and evidence \nsuggests that it might be strongly related to the Openness to Experience factor of the Big Five \nmodel of personality (McCrae, 1987), attributes of the creative personality will not be \ndiscussed here either. The present investigation will focus on the creative potential, that is, the \ncognitive underpinnings of the creative working of the mind. \nTheories of creativity, similarly to the wide range of issues covered by it, are \nnumerous. Authors working within the psychodynamic (Freud, 1908\/1959; Kris, 1952), the \nhumanistic (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Maslow, 1968; Rogers, 1954) as well as the socio-\npsychological (Amabile, 1983, 1996) approaches have put forward theories in an attempt to \naccount for this phenomenon. Although as proponents of recent models of creativity \n(Amabile, 1983, 1996; Sternberg, and Lubart, 1991, 1996) rightly point out, creativity is \nprobably best hypothesised as a complex interplay of several cognitive, personality, \nmotivational, and social factors, they also state that intellectual abilities are arguably among \n 5 \nthe most important components of creativity (Lubart, 1994). Therefore, the approach chosen \nin this article, which concentrates purely on the cognitive factors underlying creativity, seems \nto be justifiable.  \nGuilford (1950) was among the first to put forward a list of cognitive processes \ninvolved in creativity. He believed that these processes include sensitivity to problems, \ncreative fluency of production, ability to come up with novel ideas, flexibility of mind, \nsynthesising ability, analysing ability, reorganisation or redefinition of organised wholes, a \nhigh degree of complexity of the conceptual structure, and evaluation. However, as Guilford \n(1959) later developed a comprehensive model of human intellect, he started to focus on \ndivergent thinking, the ability to produce many different ideas in response to a problem, as the \nprime cognitive component of creativity. He suggested that it was an operation \ncomplementary to convergent thinking, the ability to find the correct solution to a problem; \nthe cognitive process that he believed is tapped by the majority of intelligence tests. Divergent \nthinking is hypothesised to have four relatively independent facets: creative fluency, the \nability to produce a large number of ideas, flexibility, the ability to produce a wide variety of \nideas, originality, the ability to produce unusual ideas, and elaboration, the ability to develop \nor embellish ideas and to produce many details (Baer, 1993).  \nToday intellectual abilities considered to be relevant for creativity are usually grouped \ninto two large categories: basic-level and high-level creativity-relevant abilities (Lubart, \n1994). Basic-level creative abilities consist of two types: the above-described divergent \nthinking and different insight abilities comprising the capacities to notice relevant new \ninformation, to compare disparate information, to find relevant connections, and to combine \ninformation in a problem-relevant fashion. High-level abilities include problem-finding, \nproblem-definition or redefinition, choosing a useful problem presentation, selecting an \nappropriate problem-solving strategy, and evaluating the generated possibilities effectively. It \nis interesting to note that some of these processes are hypothesised to be related to language \naptitude within the CANAL-F theory, a framework of language aptitude recently developed \nby Grigorenko, Sternberg, and Ehrman (2000).  \n The two lists of creativity-relevant intellectual abilities have a number of common \nfactors, which draws attention to the fact that in almost fifty years one thing certainly did not \nchange: researchers believe that creativity rests on the same cognitive foundations as other \nintellectual abilities, such as intelligence. As a result, the cognitive abilities that form the basis \nof creativity are usually integrated into comprehensive theories of intellect (Carroll, 1993; \nGuilford, 1967; Sternberg, 1985b). Although theories of intellect bear relevance for theories \n 6 \nof creativity and provide a general frame of interpretation of the phenomenon, the drawback \nof this approach is that creativity becomes difficult to distinguish from other intellectual \nabilities in terms of purely cognitive factors. \nCurrent factor-analytic research suggests, however, that factors of creativity-relevant \nintellectual abilities tend to load on one common higher-order factor called idea production, \nwhich provides empirical evidence of the autonomous existence of this ability. Carroll (1993), \nhaving reviewed and reanalysed 121 datasets, found nine basic factors to be relevant for idea \nproduction, which he believes is a basic human characteristic: ideational fluency, naming \nfacility, associational fluency, expressional fluency, word fluency, sensitivity to problems, \noriginality\/creativity, figural fluency, and figural flexibility. In the term \u2019idea production\u2019, the \nnotion of \u2019idea\u2019 is to be taken in the broadest possible sense: it can be any verbal proposition, \nbut it may also be a gesture, a drawing, or a musical phrase. \u2019Production\u2019 is meant as a \nprocess distinct from recognition, identification, selection or comparison. Out of the nine  \nfactors, eight are primarily concerned with the speed of idea production and are differentiated \non the basis of the type of the idea produced, whereas originality\/creativity seems to \ndetermine the quality or level of idea production. Based on Carroll\u2019s findings, idea production \nis usually measured by tasks which prompt examinees to quickly think of a series of \nresponses. While this is true for all the tasks used to measure the nine factors, there is a \nspecial requirement when our aim is to measure originality\/creativity. In that case the task \nitself needs to be difficult or challenging in order to urge respondents to go beyond the \nobvious and commonplace answers.  \nThis factor-analytic investigation led to the formulation of Carroll\u2019s (1993) three-\nstratum theory of cognitive abilities, where the concept of idea production is labelled general \nretrieval ability, the ability which is \"involved in any task or performance that requires the \nready retrieval of concepts or items from long-term memory\" (p.625). Since it is a \nfundamental characteristic of factor-analysis that the input data determine the output, that is, \nthe tests and tasks analysed and the scoring procedures employed necessarily influence and \npossibly constrain the outcome, further research is needed to clarify the structure of the \ndomain of general retrieval ability. This could probably be achieved by devising more \nappropriate and highly reliable measurement procedures. It is also interesting that although \nGuilford\u2019s (1959) Structure of Intellect model is not compatible with the results of the \nexploratory factor analysis on which the three-stratum theory is founded, still the domain of \ngeneral retrieval ability \"is chiefly (but not entirely) concerned with Guilford\u2019s divergent \nproduction operation\" (Carroll, 1993, p. 638).  \n 7 \nWhen trying to assess a person\u2019s creative potentials, usually two different approaches \nare taken. One option is measuring several non-cognitive aspects of creativity, such as \npersonality and motivation, in addition to intellectual processes and intellectual style as was \ndone by Sternberg and Lubart (1991), who tried to establish individual creativity this way. \nAlthough this approach is more in line with current constructs of creativity, it is not feasible \nin research designs where creativity needs to be operationalised as one single variable. The \nother option, therefore, is to try to assess divergent thinking, the intellectual ability that is \nthought to be most characteristic of the creative process (Guilford, 1967; Torrance, 1962). \nAlthough tests of divergent thinking have been criticised on many accounts (Jordan, 1975; \nKogan and Pankove, 1974), because of their reported validity, reliability (Cropley, 1972; \nHarrington, Block, and Block, 1983) and their relative ease of use, they are still widely \napplied as indicators of individual creativity in research on individual variables (Ghadirian, \nGregoire, and Kosmidis, 2000-2001; Jung, 2000-2001; Russ and Seja-Kaugars, 2000-2001). \nAs McCrae (1987) pointed out, \u201calthough tests like Word Fluency certainly have limited face \nvalidity as measures of creativity, their ability to identify creative individuals is an empirical \nmatter, and in fact they are reasonably successful in this\u201d (p. 1258).  \nThe above described difficulties might partly be held accountable for the fact that SLA \nresearch of individual learner variables has failed to investigate the effects of creativity \nalthough the influence of other cognitive variables such as intelligence, language aptitude and \ndifferent learning and thinking styles have been researched widely (for reviews see Gardner \nand MacIntyre, 1992, 1993; Oxford and Ehrman, 1993; Skehan, 1989, 1991). We have made \nan attempt at bridging this gap by carrying out research on the effects of learner creativity on \nthe performance of oral narrative tasks. For our purposes, creativity was defined as the \nperson\u2019s ability to come up with a large number of novel and statistically rare solutions on a \ngiven task and was operationalised as the total score achieved on a standardised creativity test \n(Bark\u00f3czi and Z\u00e9t\u00e9nyi, 1981). \n \nTasks in SLA research \n \n During the past two decades foreign language teaching has become more and more \ncharacterised by the communicative approach to language teaching, whose main objective is \n\u201cto develop the learner\u2019s ability to take part in spontaneous and meaningful communication in \ndifferent contexts, with different people, on different topics, for different purposes\u201d (Celce-\nMurcia, D\u00f6rnyei, and Thurrell, 1997, p. 149). A relatively new approach within this \n 8 \nframework is task-based instruction, which calls for language teaching to be organised around \ndifferent tasks (Long, and Crookes, 1993; Pica, Kanagy, and Falodun, 1993; Plough, and \nGass, 1993; Skehan, 1998; Willis, and Willis, 1996). Consequently, tasks, more specifically \ntheir components, characteristics, different types, and implementation conditions, have been \nthe focus of much recent research. Although by placing emphasis on different aspects of \ntasks, various authors (e.g. Bygate, 1999; Candlin, 1987; Long, 1985; Nunan, 1989) suggest \nslightly different definitions, in this article Skehan\u2019s (1996) comprehensive definition was \nadopted which states that a task is \u201can activity in which: meaning is primary; there is some \nrelationship to the real world; task completion has some priority; and the assessment of task \nperformance is in terms of task outcome\u201d (p. 38). \n The ordering of different tasks has prime importance in task-based instruction, as \nauthors working within this framework argue that language learning and teaching should be \nsequenced by means of tasks; therefore, tasks form the basis of the curriculum. Several \ncriteria have been suggested for the sequencing of tasks. It is often argued that tasks should be \narranged in an order of complexity (Long, 1985) or difficulty (Brown, Anderson, Shilcock, \nand Yule, 1984; Candlin, 1987; Skehan, 1996, 1998) although the precise meaning of these \nterms varies from one author to the other. In a recent article Robinson (2001) attempted to \nestablish \u201ctheoretically motivated, empirically substantiable, and pedagogically feasible \nsequencing criteria\u201d (p. 27). He distinguished three independent facets of tasks: task \ncomplexity, task difficulty, and task conditions. Task complexity in his interpretation is the \nresult of various information processing demands that the structure of the task imposes on the \nlearners; task difficulty covers learner factors: differences between learners in their cognitive \nand affective resources that makes certain tasks personally difficult for them, while task \nconditions include participation and participant factors, and the context of task performance.  \n Robinson (2001) argues that sequencing decisions should be solely based on task \ncomplexity, as this is a fixed and invariant feature of the task; consequently, a simple task will \nbe less demanding than a more complex one for any given learner. Task difficulty, on the \nother hand, explains individual differences between learners, showing why one particular task \nshould be more or less difficult for different learners. As differences between learners in \naffective variables, such as motivation, and social factors, such as group cohesion, that were \nshown to contribute to differences in task performance (D\u00f6rnyei and Kormos, 2000) are \nvariable and temporal, they should form the basis of on-line methodological decisions \naccording to Robinson. The effects of the more stable cognitive abilities such as intelligence, \naptitude or even creativity could be taken into consideration as well, if conclusive results were \n 9 \navailable about the way they affect performance on tasks. Although Robinson\u2019s framework is \nprimarily motivated by the aim to offer guidance regarding sequencing decisions, it also \ndraws attention to the importance of individual variables when implementing tasks. It is quite \nplausible that individual differences will exert their influence on performance not only in the \ncase of less or more complex tasks, but in the case of different task types as well. \n Narrative tasks are a well-established and frequently researched task type (Bygate, \n1999; Foster, and Skehan, 1996; Robinson, 1995; Skehan, and Foster, 1997, 1999). They \nusually involve the creation of a story in response to some kind of stimulus: a picture strip or \na short film. As in most of the cases the stimuli given are purely visual and their verbal \nrepresentations depend on the storyteller to a great extent, this task type seems ideal as far as \nthe manifestation of creativity is concerned. The language output generated on oral narrative \ntasks is usually examined in terms of its complexity, accuracy, and fluency (Crookes, 1989, \nFoster, and Skehan, 1996, Skehan, and Foster, 1997, 1999). Complexity in this sense is \nrelated to the syntactic structure of language; accuracy reflects how well-controlled and \ntarget-like the forms are; while fluency gives an indication of the learner\u2019s ability to cope with \nreal-time communication. When comparing performance on oral narrative tasks to personal \ninformation exchange and decision-making tasks, Foster and Skehan (1996) found that \nlanguage output was the most complex and least accurate in narratives. In a more recent study \nSkehan and Foster (1999) reported more fluent performance on tasks having clear inherent \nstructure. Bygate (1999) argued that different task types urge learners to use a set of specific \nlinguistic features, and described oral narrative tasks as more complex both syntactically and \nlexically in comparison with argumentative tasks. Robinson (1995), who studied oral \nnarrative tasks with varying cognitive complexity, found that lexical variety (measured by the \ntype-token ratio) and accuracy (measured by the number of error-free communication units) \nincrease in cognitively more complex tasks.  \n \nThe effect of individual variables on task performance \n \n Only few studies have examined the effect of individual variables on the performance \nof communicative tasks. MacIntyre and Gardner (1994) studied the influence of anxiety on \nthe quality of self-descriptions in L2. Their results indicated that anxious L2 learners \nproduced shorter self-description, which were also judged to be less fluent and less complex. \nDewaele and Furnham (2000) investigated how fluency, accuracy and the formality of \nvocabulary use were affected by extroversion. In their study extroverts were found to be more \n 10 \nfluent and used more colloquial words than introverts. D\u00f6rnyei and Kormos (2000) analysed \nhow various components of motivation affected the quantity of talk students produced in an \noral argumentation task. Students with positive attitude to the course and to the task to be \nperformed spoke considerably more than those who had negative attitudes. Self-confidence \nand willingness to communicate in L2 were also positively related to the quantity of talk. In a \nrecent study Kormos and D\u00f6rnyei (in preparation) found that students with positive attitude to \nthe task produced more accurate language than those whose attitude was negative. They also \nestablished a negative relationship between anxiety and lexical richness.  \n \nThe relevance of creativity for learner performance on tasks \n \n Having reviewed the literature on creativity and tasks separately, we should now turn \nour attention to possible points of interaction. The relevance of creativity for learner \nperformance on tasks can be examined on two levels. One of them is the level of specific \ncognitive mechanisms that are believed to contribute to creativity. Since the instrument used \nas a test of creativity in the study aimed at identifying divergent thinkers, it should be pointed \nout why we feel that divergent thinking might be advantageous for foreign language learners \nwhen tackling language tasks. The other level is the wider context of language teaching \nmethodology, more specifically the use of communicative methods and more recently task-\nbased instruction; in these approaches the use of drills is discouraged and emphasis is placed \non conveying meaning. Despite the fact that these two levels can be considered as separate \ntheoretically, we are aware that they interact to a great extent in practice: in most cases \nlanguage learning is mediated by some kind of methodology. \n On the basis of the literature review, we hypothesised that since creativity is usually \nmanifested in production, that is, in creative products, its effects would probably be more \neasily detectable in output as opposed to comprehension. We believe that there are a number \nof reasons why language tasks, especially open-ended ones like narrative tasks, where there is \nno correct solution but a large number of solutions are possible, could be better suited for \ncreative foreign language learners. Since creative learners are characterised by greater \nfluency, that is they provide a larger number of solutions in a given amount of time (Baer, \n1993), they might be able to talk more during the tasks. As it has been suggested by Swain \n(1980) producing more comprehensible output has a beneficial effect on language acquisition. \nFlexibility, the second facet of creativity measured by divergent thinking tests, which reflects \nthe ability to produce a wide variety of ideas (Baer, 1993), might be manifested directly in the \n 11 \nway language is used by the learners: if their language competence is sufficient, they might in \nfact use a wider range of vocabulary items in order to express their wide range of ideas. \nSimilarly, originality, the ability to produce unusual ideas (Baer, 1993), might also prompt \nlearners to employ a wide range of vocabulary in an attempt to give an account of the \ninteresting ideas they have in mind. Although the above-mentioned qualities of creative \npeople might be advantageous in any language task, we feel that narrative tasks, which \nobviously rely on learners\u2019 imagination, might intensify the effect of creativity on language \nperformance. Therefore, despite the fact that the imaginativeness or creativity of the stories \nthemselves cannot be measured, we believed that narrative tasks would be suitable for \nconducting exploratory research on the effects of creativity on output.  \n \nMethod \n \nThe study reported in this paper constitutes part of a larger longitudinal research project the \nprimary aim of which was to investigate task-based learning in five Hungarian secondary \nschool groups (see also Bygate, 1999; D\u00f6rnyei and Kormos, 2000, D\u00f6rnyei, 2002; N\u00e9meth \nand Kormos, 2001). The data-collection phase of the project was conducted jointly with staff \nmembers from the University of Leeds and E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University.  \n \n \nResearch questions and hypotheses \n \nThe aim of our study was to investigate the effect of creativity on task-performance in oral \nnarrative tasks. Our hypotheses were the following: \n1. All the components of creativity have an effect on narrative task performance. \n2. Among the measures of task-performance the quantity of talk produced, lexical variety \nand narrative structure are influenced by creativity. \n3. Grammatical complexity and accuracy are not affected by measures of creativity. \n \n 12 \nParticipants \n \nAll together 67 students from five classes in two different secondary schools participated in \nthe project. Since the data collection took place on four different occasions, we only have full \ndata for 35 participants due to illnesses and other reasons for absences. The students were 15-\n16 years old, and 20 of them were female and 15 male. The two schools that the students \nattended were of the same type (secondary grammar school); they provided general \ninstruction and prepared students for further studies in higher education. The participants \nwere all judged to be intermediate speakers of English by their classroom teachers.  \n \nProcedure \n \nAt the beginning of the project a C-test was administered to all the participants to measure \ntheir global language proficiency. The C-test used was validated for Hungarian learners of \nEnglish (D\u00f6rnyei and Katona, 1992). Students completed two alternative versions of an oral \nnarrative task with an interval of two months (see Appendix for an example of the tasks). \nAfter the completion of the tasks, students were asked to fill in a creativity test in Hungarian, \nwhich was developed by Bark\u00f3czi and Klein (cited in Bark\u00f3czi and Z\u00e9t\u00e9nyi, 1981) and was \nstandardised for the Hungarian adult population. \n \nCreativity test \n \nThe standardised creativity test (Bark\u00f3czi and Z\u00e9t\u00e9nyi, 1981) used in the study consisted of \nfive parts, but as the first task was meant to serve as a warm-up, only the remaining four tasks \nwere scored. There was a time limit set for each task, and the participants were not allowed to \ngo back to previous tasks. In order to ensure that these rules were strictly kept, one of the \nresearchers was always present while students filled in the test. The warm-up task was a \nsentence completion exercise, in which respondents were asked to finish sentences within \nthree minutes. The first two tasks required verbal responses from the participants. In the task \ncalled 'unusual uses\u2019 respondents had to invent unusual uses of everyday objects such as a \nbrick. In the 'distant associations' task (in a similar fashion to Mednick\u2019s (1962) Remote \nAssociates Test), students had to create associations on the basis of the common \ncharacteristics of two unrelated words (e.g.: given the words cannon and sky think of a word \nrelated to both of them but in different ways: thunder). The last two tasks were drawing tasks \n 13 \n(based on the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking; Torrance, 1966). Respondents were asked \nto draw as many pictures as they could, starting out from the shape of a circle, and to finish \nabstract shapes in a creative manner. The four tasks lasted for five, six, eight and ten minutes \nrespectively.  \n \nTasks \n \nThe two very similar versions of an oral narrative task used in this research involved \ninventing a story on the basis of a picture. The task was designed by a group of experienced \nteachers and researchers for the purposes of this research. In order to ensure the feasibility and \nthe appropriate level of difficulty of the tasks, the comments of the teachers who taught the \nstudents participating in the study were also taken into consideration. Students performed the \ntasks in the framework of their regular English classes. The tasks were presented to the \nstudents by their teachers. Students worked in pairs while performing the task; one of them \nplayed the role of the speaker and the other the role of the audience. In each case the members \nof the pair received different pictures. The students' task was to invent a short story based on \nthe picture, and tell it to their partner after 5 minutes of individual planning time. The five- \nminute planning time was meant to give students an opportunity to plan the content of their \nnarratives. The planning time was standardised for all the groups. Although the instructions of \nthe tasks said that students could tell a true story as well, all the participants invented their \nown stories and did not choose this option. \n \nAnalysis \nMeasures of creativity \n \nThe scoring of the standardized creativity test was carried out in accordance with the process \nspecified by Bark\u00f3czi and Z\u00e9t\u00e9nyi (1981). Each item of the test was scored for three out of the \nfour measures of creativity as defined by Baer (1993) (this creativity test does not measure \nelaboration), and the sub-scores were added up for the different tasks. Therefore, each of the \nfour sub-sections of the test received three scores independently, a fluency score, a flexibility \nscore and an originality score. The fluency score, which in this study will be called creative \nfluency in order to differentiate it from the temporal variable also called fluency, equalled the \nnumber of responses given, while the flexibility score reflected the number of categories the \nsubjects selected their answers from (the categories were set up in the course of the \n 14 \nstandardisation procedure by Bark\u00f3czi and Z\u00e9t\u00e9nyi (1981)). The originality score was \nassigned on the basis of a list containing an index calculated from the statistical frequency of \nthe given response (set up in the course of the standardization procedure by Bark\u00f3czi and \nZ\u00e9t\u00e9nyi, 1981). Originality scores of different items varied from 0.01 to 0.99 points, while \nflexibility and creative fluency scores of each response were worth 1 point. The total \ncreativity score was calculated by adding up all the creative fluency, flexibility and originality \nscores of the various sub-tasks.  Apart from this total score, different sub-scores were also \ncalculated: total creative fluency, the sum of the four creative fluency sub-scores; total \nflexibility, the sum of the four flexibility sub-scores; and total originality, the sum of the four \noriginality sub-scores. It is easy to demonstrate that in this scoring system the creative fluency \nscore (more precisely the number of responses the subject produces) influences both the \noriginality and the flexibility total scores significantly. The high correlations between the \nfluency, originality and flexibility sub-scores are the reason why some authors (Hargreaves \nand Bolton, 1972) argued for dropping the originality and flexibility scores altogether since in \nthis form they provide little additional information. We also believe that this scoring system is \nbiased, since for example, if a person produces two highly original ideas worth the maximum \nscore 0.99 point each, his total originality score will be 1.98 points for the given task. If, \nhowever, another student produces five statistically more common responses worth 0.50 point \neach, his originality score will be higher (2.5 points), than that of his\/her less fluent peer, and \nin this way a misleading picture is gained about the two students\u2019 true originality. Since a \nsimilar scoring method is applied for the flexibility scores (each new category is rewarded \nwith 1 point without considering the total number or responses), they can be said to be \naffected by creative fluency to a great extent as well. For this reason, the establishment of \ncreative fluency free scores was very important as these could provide information about \nother facets of the subjects' creativity, regardless of the number of responses they produced. In \norder to achieve this relative flexibility (the ratio of total flexibility and total creative fluency) \nand average originality (the ratio of total originality and total creative fluency) were also \ncalculated, in line with the procedure specified in the test (Bark\u00f3czi and Z\u00e9t\u00e9nyi, 1981). This \nway the total creative fluency score can be used to measure creative fluency, the relative \nflexibility score to measure flexibility and the average originality score to measure originality \nas defined above.  \n \nMeasures of task performance \n \n 15 \nStudents\u2019 performance on the narrative tasks was transcribed by trained research assistants \nand the transcripts were checked by the researchers. The texts generated by the students were \nexamined separately, but their measures were added up. The reason for using two texts was to \nreduce elements of chance, such as the lack of motivation or dislike for a certain topic. Table \n1 summarises the variables used in the study. \n-------------------------------- \nInsert Table 1 around here \n-------------------------------- \nThe quantity of talk students produced was measured by the total number of words \n(see also Dewaele, 2000; Dewaele and Pavlenko, 2003; D\u00f6rnyei, and Kormos, 2000). In order \nto assess lexical diversity, we used Malvern's and Richards' (1997) D-formula. This formula is \nbased on the widely used measure of lexical variety (see e.g. Robinson, 1995; 2001 in task-\nbased research), the type-token ratio (TTR), which is the total number of different words \n(types) divided by the total number of words (tokens) produced. The problem with the TTR \nis, however, that it depends on the sample size, that is, on the number of words spoken by the \nparticipants. Richards (1987) found that the \"type-token ratio falls rapidly as the number of \ntokens increases\" (p. 205). In a recent study Jarvis (2002) argued that two formulas based on \nthe type-token ratio: Dugast's (1980) Uber U formula and Malvern's and Richards' (1997)  D-\nformula can be used to measure lexical richness in L2 texts in a reliable way. Both measures \nshould, however, be used with a curve-fitting approach. Because there exists available \nsoftware (VOCD available at the CHILDES web-site: http\/\/childes.psy.cmu.edu) only for the \nD-formula, we applied this formula to establish a measure of lexical diversity. The calculation \nof the D-value is based on a mathematical probabilistic model, and the software uses random \nsampling of tokens in plotting the curve of TTR against increasing token size for the text to be \ninvestigated. Malvern and Richards (1997) argue that the D-value is a valid measure of \ndiversity because it does not depend on the length of the sample, and it uses all the words \nproduced by the participants. \n Accuracy was measured by the proportion of error-free clauses relative to the total \nnumber of clauses, and grammatical complexity with the ratio of total number of clauses to \nthe total number of AS-units. These measures have been widely used in task-based research \nand have proven to reflect the accuracy and grammatical complexity of students' output in a \nreliable manner (see Bygate, 1999; Foster, and Skehan, 1996; Skehan, and Foster, 1997). Our \nvariables only differed from that of Bygate (1999), Foster and Skehan (1996) and Skehan and \nFoster (1997) that instead of c- and T-units as the unit of measurement, we applied AS-units \n 16 \nthat seem to be better measures in the case of spoken data produced by L2 speakers (Foster et \nal., 2000). Foster et al. (2000) defined AS-units as \"single speaker's utterance consisting of an \nindependent clause or sub-clausal unit, together with any subordinate clause(s) associated \nwith either\" (p. 365). Foster at al. distinguish three levels of application for the use of AS-unit \nin analysing L2 speech. Level 1 analysis is applied for the full analysis of the data, when \neverything except untranscribable fragments of speech are included in the transcript. Level 2 \nanalysis is used for highly interactional data, and at this level, one word minor utterances are \nexcluded from the analysis. Level 3 analysis is applied when only non-fragmented, i.e., \ncomplete AS-units are analysed. In this study Level 2 analysis was used, and one word \nutterances such as Yes, No, Okay, Uhuh, Right and Echo responses were not included in the \nanalysis.  \n \nExample: \nAS-unit boundary is indicated with \/ \nStudent 25 \nA woman who lived in Europe decided to go to Africa to to to uhm observe how the \nmonkeys live there \/ uhm as as she arrived er there she had to to travel through the jungle \/ \nand she had a possibility to to observe the other animals how they live in in the jungle and \nhow what they they make there \/ uhm and er she arrived to the farm where er she found a a lot \nof animal animals \/ and she saw the monkeys erm who live together in a in a small house uhm \n\/- er the people who lived around this jungle er told that the monkeys  er had had a  had an \nillness\u2026\/ \n \n Our analysis of the narrative structure of the students' texts was based on Labov's \n(1972) classification of the elements of a narrative. According to Labov, the skeleton of any \nnarrative consists of narrative clauses, which are temporally ordered independent clauses \nconnected by temporal junctures. Therefore, the texts elicited by the tasks were analysed for \nthe number of narrative clauses per AS-unit. Narrative clauses reflect the events of the story; \ntherefore, a high percentage of such clauses can be assumed to signal complex stories as far as \ntheir event structure is concerned.  \n \nExample: \nNarrative clauses are underlined and numbered \n 17 \nIn the picture we can see two old   men and they are   really best   friends and they had a \ndream for 20 30 years.  They they wanted to go to the Alps   but they had no money.  (1) But \none day er one of them had a chance on gambling  (2) and he won a travel to the Alps for two \nperson. (3)  So they decided to to go there (4) and they arrived they were happy + but eer   \nthey were very very old   and and by climbing a mountain (5) one of them   fall fall down and \n(6) then he died + and so the other was so sad   that he liked to + so na the they dreaming their \ndreams for ever and the Alps. \n \nIn the case of the analysis of narrative structure and accuracy, the texts were coded by \nthe two researchers separately, and inter-rater reliability was found to be high (r = 0.93 for \nnarrative structure; r = 0.95 for accuracy). For the statistical analysis SPSS (Statistical \nPackage for Social Sciences) was used. The level of significance for this study was set at p < \n0.05. The statistical analyses performed were Pearson correlations, in which we correlated the \nmeasures of task performance and creativity. Because, as will be shown in Table 2, there was \nconsiderable between-subjects variation in the learner's language performance measures, for \nthe correlational analyses we computed standard scores for both the independent and the \ndependent variables. Standardised z scores express how many standard deviations above or \nbelow the mean a particular score is located. This standardised score is widely used in testing \nresearch (Hatch and Lazaraton, 1991) and also in studies on individual differences (D\u00f6rnyei \nand Kormos, 2000; D\u00f6rnyei, 2002; Gardner, 1985). In order to control for the effect of \nproficiency, partial correlations using students' C-test scores were computed. \n \nResults  \n \nTable 2 summarises the descriptive statistics of the language performance measures. \nAs can be seen in the table, there is considerable difference between the participants \nespecially in the case of the quantity of talk produced. Students also differed greatly as \nregards the number of narrative clauses produced and lexical variety. Nevertheless, the \ndistribution of none of the variables was skewed, which allowed for the use of parametric \nstatistical procedures. The considerable between-subjects variation in the case of a number of \nvariables was the reason for using standard scores in the subsequent correlational analyses. \nTable 3 contains the average originality, flexibility and total fluency scores as well as the total \ncreativity score for the participants. In the table we also indicate the values of these variables \nfor a larger Hungarian population investigated by Bark\u00f3czy and Z\u00e9t\u00e9nyi (1981). It can be seen \n 18 \nthat the average scores were somewhat higher for all of the variables in our high-school \npopulation than in the national sample. This tendency is especially striking for the total \nfluency and total creativity scores, where the national average was the minimum value in our \nsample. This can probably be explained by the fact that our participants attended grammar \nschool, whereas the national population also includes students from vocational and vocational \nsecondary schools.  \n \n-------------------------------- \nInsert Tables 2 and 3 around here \n-------------------------------- \nThe results of the correlational analyses are summarized in Table 4. The findings indicate that \ntwo components of creativity are associated with some measures of task performance: 1) \noriginality, that is, the average number of original solutions students produced in the \ncreativity test, and 2) creative fluency, that is the total number of solutions participants gave \nin the creativity test. No significant correlations were found between task-related variables \nand flexibility and the total creativity score.  \n--------------------------------           \nInsert Table 4 around here \n-------------------------------- \n                                 \nA modest effect of originality can be seen in the case of measures of quantity of talk. \nThe number of words (r = -.34; p < 0.03) is negatively correlated with the average originality \nscore of students. In other words, students who produce a high number of original ideas in the \ncreativity test produce short stretches of talk. A weak, but significant positive correlation was \nalso found between creative fluency and the number of words (r = .33; p < 0.03). Lexical \nvariety, accuracy and complexity did not correlate with any of the measures of creativity. The \ndiscourse complexity of the narrative produced was also found to be affected by originality as \nthe number of narrative clauses per AS unit correlated positively with the average originality \nscore (r = .34; p < 0.04).  \n \nDiscussion \n \nThese findings indicate that Hypothesis 1, namely that all the components of creativity \nhave an effect on narrative task performance, is only partially supported as flexibility was not \n 19 \nfound to influence students' output. The results also lend only partial support to Hypothesis 2, \nin which we hypothesised that the quantity of talk produced, lexical variety and narrative \nstructure are affected by originality and creative fluency. Hypothesis 3 that grammatical \ncomplexity and accuracy wound not be influenced by creativity was confirmed.  \nIn general, we can conclude that the correlations between measures of creativity and \nnarrative task performance are not very high; approximately 10-16% of the variance in \nlinguistic measures is related to creative fluency and originality. This shows that these \ncomponents of creativity have a moderate effect on the quantity of talk and narrative \nstructure. It is also possible that most of the variance in task performance among students is \ncaused by motivation (D\u00f6rnyei, 2002), personality variables such as extraversion (Dewaele & \nFurnham, 2000), anxiety (MacIntyre and Gardner, 1994) and situational factors such as the \ninterlocutor (D\u00f6rnyei, 2002), and among these many factors creativity contributes to the \nquality of task performance only to a limited extent.  \nThe results support theories of creativity which argue that creativity is not a unitary \ntrait, but consists of several independent components. Among these components, creative \nfluency, that is the ability to invent a high number of solutions in a task seems to be related \nonly to the quantity of talk. The sum of the various components (total creativity) does not \ninfluence linguistic measures in this study. It seems that from the point of view of L2 speech \nproduction, it is rather originality, in other words, the quality of creative ideas that matters. \nThe finding that students who produce a high number of original solutions talk less is \nprobably related to the fact that coming up with unusual solutions requires a long period of \nthinking time, and results in a low number of solutions in general. In the narrative task used in \nthis study, this manifests itself in that 'original' students produce less speech, but what they \nsay has a complex discourse structure. In other words, the results also indicate that the \ncomplexity of narrative structure is influenced by originality as the participants of the project \nwho invented a high number of solutions in a cognitive task, produced a high number of \nnarrative clauses per AS unit. Narrative clauses are assumed to reflect the events of the story \n(Labov, 1972); therefore, it can be stated that more original students produced stories with a \nhigher number of events than their less original counterparts.  \nThe accuracy of task performance was not expected to be influenced by creativity as \nother individual variables such as extraversion were not found to be related to this measure \neither (Dewaele, 2000). We did not expect a relationship between complexity and creativity \neither as we hypothesised that grammatical complexity is mainly determined by proficiency, \n 20 \neven though in certain conditions some individual characteristics such as extraversion were \nfound to affect the mean length of utterance (Dewaele, 2000). \nThe unexpected result of the study was that creativity did not correlate with the D-\nvalue, which is one of the most reliable measures of lexical diversity (see e.g. Jarvis, 2002; \nMalvern and Richards, 1997). It seems that in our sample the ability to come up with a wide \nvariety of ideas in one's native language is not influenced by the ability to use a large array of \nwords in a narrative task in a foreign language. Lexical variety might also be a function of \nlanguage proficiency (for a review see Reid, 2000) and might rather be related to some other \nindividual variables such as motivation (Kormos and D\u00f6rnyei, in preparation) and \nextraversion (Dewaele and Furnham, 1999). \nThese findings complement the series of studies conducted by Ehrman and her \ncolleagues (Ehrman, 1996; Ehrman, and Oxford, 1995; Grigorenko, Sternberg, and Ehrman, \n2000) who claim that the ability to cope with novelty is an important characteristic that affects \nthe success of language learning. Their line of argumentation can be extended, and on the \nbasis of our results, we can argue that the ability to produce original, that is, novel ideas in \ngeneral, does moderately affect how students perform in a particular language learning task. \nThe moderate effect can be due to the small sample size and to the fact that only one very \nspecific task was used for the purposes of our study.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n \n The findings of our research show that differences in creativity can account for certain \ndifferences in learners\u2019 performance on oral narrative tasks. The most important effect of \ncreativity manifests itself in productivity. The study also suggests that creativity is best \nhypothesised as a multifaceted trait as students scoring high on various components of \ncreativity seemed to complete the same task in different ways. Students who invent a high \nnumber of solutions in a creativity test were found to engage in more talk, thus, in a foreign \nlanguage setting, they might create more opportunities for themselves to use the language. \nThe learners characterised by a higher level of originality tended to speak less and created \nmore complex stories in terms of the narrative structure, but at the same time they might \ndeprive themselves of the beneficial effects of more output.  These results clearly indicate that \nbesides investigating the effects of individual variables on global measures of foreign \nlanguage performance, it is also possible to study their influence on specific tasks. Gathering \ndata at this level would be desirable because information gained about the interplay of \n 21 \nindividual differences and various aspects of task performance could contribute to \npedagogical decisions during task implementation and could help the selection of language \nteaching and testing tasks. \nIt has to be pointed out, however, that in the present study aspects of creativity were \nfound to account only for 10-15% of the variance in the students' performance. The weak \ncorrelations might be due to the small number of participants or to the more important effect \nof other situational, social and individual factors, therefore a follow-up study with higher \nnumber of participants would be necessary to establish with more certainty how important the \nrole of creativity is in task performance. In addition, as one of the reviewers pointed out the \nrelatively long planning time given to the participants (5 minutes) might have also caused that \ncreativity did not significantly influence task performance. Thus, in future research the effect \nof creativity could be investigated under different planning conditions. Moreover, further \nstudies could also explore issues that seem particularly interesting in the light of the present \nfindings. Since it is intuitively appealing that communicative and task based methods, books, \nand tasks require creativity, it might be worthwhile to analyse the relationship between \ncreativity and achievement in language learning. Another possible research direction could \ninvolve examining possible interactions of the cognitive complexity of tasks and creativity as \nan individual variable that contributes to task difficulty. Although in Robinson\u2019s (2001) view, \ntask complexity and difficulty are independent dimensions, it is also possible that for certain \nindividual variables the two might interact. In the case of an interaction, the effects of task \ncomplexity and task difficulty could no longer be simply summed up, but they would vary \ndepending on the level of the individual variable, such as creativity.  \n \n  \n 22 \nREFERENCES \n \nAmabile, T.
