Decision-\nmakers in tourist destinations, especially those destinations where tourism is one of \nthe major sources of foreign exchange, have put much effort into trying to understand \nthe key determinants of demand for their tourism products and services in the hope of \nformulating and implementing appropriate tourism policies and strategies. Many \nempirical studies on tourism demand modelling and forecasting have been published \nover the period, and these studies have undoubtedly proved useful for tourism \ndecision-makers. Detailed reviews of such studies can be found in Witt and Witt \n(1995), Lim (1997) and Song and Witt (2000). Most of the empirical studies are based \non the single-equation approach, which suffers from specific limitations. Eadington \nand Redman (1991) have noted that this approach is incapable of analysing the \ninterdependence of budget allocations to different consumer goods\/services. For \nexample, in the tourism context, the decision-making involves making a choice \nThe linear almost ideal demand system (LAIDS), in both static and dynamic forms, is \nexamined in the context of international tourism demand. The superiority of the \ndynamic error correction LAIDS compared to its static counterpart is demonstrated \nin terms of both the acceptability of theoretical restrictions and forecasting accuracy, \nusing a data set on the expenditure of United Kingdom tourists in twenty-two Western \nEuropean countries. Both long-run and short-run demand elasticites are calculated. \nThe expenditure elasticities show that travelling to most major destinations in \nWestern Europe appears to be a luxury for UK tourists in the long run. The demand \nfor travel to these destinations by UK tourists is also likely to be more price elastic in \nthe long run than in the short run. The calculated cross-price elasticites suggest that \nthe substitution\/complementarity effects vary from destination to destination. \n \nKeywords: Tourism demand, linear almost ideal demand system (LAIDS), error \ncorrection, demand elasticity, forecasting \n 2 \namong a group of alternative destinations. A price change in one destination may \ninfluence tourists\u2019 decisions on travelling to a number of alternative destinations, as \nwell as their expenditure in those destinations. However, lacking an explicit basis in \nconsumer demand theory, the single-equation methodology cannot adequately model \nthe influence of a change in tourism prices in a particular destination on the demand \nfor other destinations. Another limitation of the single-equation approach is that it \ncannot be used to test the symmetry and adding-up hypotheses associated with \nexisting demand theories.  \n \nThe system of equations approach initiated by Stone (1954) overcomes these \nlimitations. By including a group of equations (one for each consumer good) in the \nsystem and estimating them simultaneously, this approach allows one to examine how \nconsumers choose bundles of goods in order to maximise their preference or utility \nwith budget constraints. In the tourism context, the system of equations approach can \nhelp to analyse the impacts of relative prices in different destinations on tourists\u2019 \nbudget allocation, i.e., which destination to visit amongst a group of alternatives. \nMoreover, since the cross-price elasticities associated with the estimated equations \nwithin the system have a strong theoretical base, the interrelationships between \nalternative destinations can be effectively evaluated. Hence it provides more reliable \ninformation for policy evaluation than the single-equation alternatives. \n \n Although there are a number of system modelling approaches available, the almost \nideal demand system (AIDS), introduced by Deaton and Muellbauer (1980), has been \nthe most commonly used method for analysing consumer behaviour as it has \nconsiderable advantages over the others. For example, it gives an arbitrary first-order \napproximation to any demand system; it has a flexible functional form and does not \nimpose any a priori restrictions on elasticities; it is easy to estimate and largely avoids \nthe need for non-linear estimation; the restrictions of homogeneity and symmetry can \nbe tested through linear restrictions on the parameters in the model; it is derived from \nthe consumer cost function corresponding to price-independent generalised \nlogarithmic (PIGLOG) consumer preferences, which permits an exact aggregation \nover consumers without imposing identical preferences. As far as aggregate data are \nconcerned, a rational representative consumer is assumed to make the budgeting \nallocation. Therefore, although the AIDS model is developed on the basis of \nmicroeconomic theory, it can readily be generalised to the aggregate level (Edgerton \net al 1996).  \n \nAlthough the AIDS model has received considerable attention in food demand \nanalysis, the application of this approach to tourism demand studies is still relatively \nrare. A thorough literature search has identified the following publications. O\u2019Hagan \nand Harrison (1984) examined American tourists\u2019 expenditure in each of 16 \nindividual destinations, while White (1985) divided the 16 destinations into 7 regions \nand added a transportation equation into the demand system. Syriopoulos and Sinclair \n(1993) and Papatheodorou (1999) studied the demand for Mediterranean tourism by \ntourists from the US and various European countries. De Mello et al (2002) \nintroduced a three-equation system to examine the expenditure allocations of UK \ntourists in France, Portugal and Spain. Divisekera (2003) applied AIDS models to \nJapan, New Zealand, UK and US demands for tourism to Australia and chosen \nalternative destinations. Lyssiotou (2001) specified a non-linear AIDS model to study \nUK demand for tourism to US, Canada and 16 European countries. The lagged \ndependent variable was included in the AIDS specification to capture the habit \npersistence effect. However, a few neighbouring destinations were aggregated in this \n 3 \nstudy, thus the substitution and complementary effects between these individual \ncountries were not available. All of the above studies focus on tourists\u2019 expenditure \nallocation to different destinations, whereas Fujii et al (1985) investigated tourists\u2019 \nexpenditure on different consumer goods in a particular destination. Apart from \nLyssiotou (2001), the specifications of AIDS models in all the other studies are static \nand can only give estimates of long-run demand elasticities. Although Lyssiotou \n(2001) incorporated the lagged dependent variable into the model specification, \nneither the long-run equilibrium relationship nor the short-term adjustment \nmechanism has been examined. Unlike all the above studies, Durbarry and Sinclair \n(2003) estimated an error correction AIDS in analysing the demand for tourism to \nItaly, Spain and the UK by French residents. This is the first attempt to use the error \ncorrection AIDS approach in tourism demand modelling and forecasting. However,                                             \nthe error correction AIDS models in their study omitted all the short-run explanatory \nvariables due to their statistical insignificance. Thus, the tourists\u2019 short-run behaviour \nwas not analysed in the study. Moreover, the forecasting performance of the dynamic \nAIDS was not examined in their study. The present study uses the cointegration and \nerror correction approaches in the specification of the AIDS models, which allow a \nfull analysis of tourists\u2019 dynamic behaviour. In other words, the responses of tourists \nto price and expenditure changes in the long run and short run are examined \nsimultaneously. Furthermore, this dynamic AIDS model is expected to generate more \naccurate forecasts than the conventional static AIDS model, especially in the short \nrun. This hypothesis is tested in Section 4. \n \nTHE MODELS \nStatic LAIDS \nThe static AIDS can be viewed as an extension of the Working-Leser model \n(Working 1943; Leser 1963) in which the budget share for good i is related to the \nlogarithms of prices and total real expenditure in the following manner: \n \n\u2211 ++=\nj\nijijii Pxbpaw )\/log(log\u03b3                                    (1) \nwhere wi is the budget share of the ith good, pj is the price of the jth good, x is total \nexpenditure on all goods in the system, P is the aggregate price index, x\/P is real total \nexpenditure, and ia , ib and ij\u03b3 are the parameters that need to be estimated. \n \nThe aggregate price index P is defined as: \n \n\u2211 \u2211\u2211++=\ni i j\njiijii pppaP loglog\n2\n1\nloglog 0 \u03b3\u03b1                      (2) \nwhere 0a and i\u03b1 are the parameters that need to be estimated. \n \nEquation (2) shows that the relationship between the price index P and the prices \nof individual goods is non-linear, which results in a complicated non-linear estimation \nof the system.  To linearise the relationship, Deaton and Muellbauer (1980) suggested \nto replace the price index P with Stone\u2019s price index (P*) which takes the form \n 4 \n\u2211=\ni\nii pwP log*log . The linear approximation of the AIDS model using this Stone\u2019s \nprice index is termed the LAIDS. Deaton and Muellbauer (1980) found that such a \nlinear approximation works well when the individual prices in the system are \ncollinear.\n1\n In tourism demand studies, the commonly used price variables are \nconsumer price indices (CPIs), which tend to be highly corelated especially amongst \nthe destinations in the same region such as Western Europe (see, for example, \nO\u2019Hagan and Harrison 1984). Therefore, the linear approximation of AIDS should be \nmore relevant to tourism demand.  \n \nTo comply with the theoretical properties of demand theory, i.e. the budget \nconstraint and utility maximisation, the following restrictions are imposed on the \nparameters in the AIDS model: \n \nAdding-up restrictions: \u2211\n=\n=\nn\ni\nia\n1\n1, \u2211\n=\n=\nn\ni\nij\n1\n0\u03b3 , and \u2211\n=\n=\nn\ni\nib\n1\n0 , which allows for all \nbudget shares to sum to unity;  \nHomogeneity: \u2211 =\nj\nij 0\u03b3 , which is based on the assumption that a proportional \nchange in all prices and expenditure does not affect the quantities purchased. In other \nwords, the consumer does not exhibit money illusion;  \nSymmetry: jiij \u03b3\u03b3 = , which takes consistency of consumers\u2019 choices into account; \n    Negativity: this requires the matrix of substitution effects to be negative \nsemidefinite. One subset of the negativity restriction implies that all the compensated \nown price elasticities must be negative (Fujii et al 1985).  \n \nResearchers are very much interested in the demand elasticities. Due to the flexible \nfunctional form of the LAIDS model, the elasticity analysis can be easily carried out.   \nThe demand elasticities are calculated as functions of the estimated parameters, and \nthey have standard implications. The expenditure elasticity ( ix\u03b5 ), which measures the \nsensitivity of demand in response to changes in expenditure, is calculated \nusing iiix wb \/1+=\u03b5 . The uncompensated own-price elasticity ( ii\u03b5 ) and cross-price \nelasticity ( ij\u03b5 ) measure how a change in the price of one product affects the demand \nfor this product and other products with the total expenditure and other prices held \nconstant. They are given by 1\/ \u2212\u2212= iiiiii bw\u03bb\u03b5  and ijiiijij wwbw \/\/ \u2212= \u03bb\u03b5 , \nrespectively. In the same way, the compensated price elasticities ( *ii\u03b5  and \n*\nij\u03b5 ), which  \nmeasure the price effects on the demand assuming the real expenditure ( Px \/ ) is \nconstant (Pyo et al 1991), are calculated as 1\/* \u2212+= iiiiii ww\u03b3\u03b5  and jiijij ww += \/\n* \u03b3\u03b5 . \nIn particular, the sign of the calculated *ij\u03b5  indicates the substitutability or \ncomplementarity between the destinations under consideration (Edgerton et al 1996). \n \n                                                           \n1\n If prices are not collinear, the use of this linear approximation may cause inconsistencies in parameter \nestimates. However, these inconsistencies are more serious in micro rather than aggregate data \n(Pashardes 1993). \n 5 \nError correction LAIDS \nIn the static LAIDS, which is also known as the long-run LAIDS model, it is \nimplicitly assumed that there is no difference between consumers\u2019 short-run and long-\nrun behaviour, i.e. the consumers\u2019 behaviour is always in \u201cequilibrium\u201d. However, in \nreality, habit persistence, adjustment costs, imperfect information, incorrect \nexpectations and misinterpreted real price changes often prevent consumers from \nadjusting their expenditure instantly to price and income changes (Anderson and \nBlundell 1983). Therefore, until full adjustment takes place consumers are \u201cout of \nequilibrium\u201d. This is one of the reasons why most static LAIDS models cannot satisfy \nthe theoretical restrictions (Duffy 2002). It is therefore necessary to augment the long-\nrun equilibrium relationship with a short-run adjustment mechanism. Moreover, the \nstatic LAIDS pays no attention to the statistical properties of the data and the dynamic \nspecification arising from time series analysis. It is well known that most economic \ndata are non-stationary, and the presence of unit roots may invalidate the asymptotic \ndistribution of the estimators. Therefore traditional statistics such as t, F and R\n2\n are \nunreliable, and least squares estimation of the static LAIDS tends to be spurious \n(Granger and Newbold 1974; Chambers 1993). Furthermore, the static LAIDS is \nunlikely to generate accurate short-run forecasts (Chambers and Nowman 1997).  \n \nThe concepts of CI and the ECM were first proposed by Engle and Granger (1987), \nand have been widely used by researchers and practitioners in modelling and \nforecasting macroeconomic activities over the last decade. The CI\/ECM technique is \nuseful for the following reasons. First, policy makers and planners are often interested \nin the long-run equilibrium relationship between economic variables, while marketers \nare mainly concerned with the short-run disequilibrium behaviour of markets and \nconsumers. Engle and Granger (1987) showed that the long-run equilibrium \nrelationship can be conveniently examined using the CI technique, and the ECM \ndescribes the short-run dynamic characteristics of economic activities. By \ntransforming the CI regression into an ECM, both the long-run equilibrium \nrelationship and short-run dynamics can be examined. Secondly, the spurious \nregression problem will not occur if the variables in the regression are cointegrated. \nThirdly, the regressors in an ECM are almost orthogonal and this avoids the \noccurrence of multicollinearity, which may otherwise be a serious problem in \neconometric analysis (Syriopoulos 1995).  \n \nBefore examining the CI relationship, all variables concerned need to be tested for \nunit roots (or orders of integration). The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) (Dickey \nand Fuller 1981) and Phillips-Perron (PP) (Phillips and Perron 1988) statistics can be \nemployed for this purpose. Once the orders of integration of the variables have been \nidentified, either the Engle and Granger (1987) two-stage approach or the Johansen \n(1988) maximum likelihood approach can be used to test for the CI relationship \namong the variables in the models (Song and Witt 2000). \n \nOnce the CI relationship between the dependent variables and the linear \ncombination of independent variables in the long-run LAIDS is confirmed, an ECM \nof the LAIDS can be established and econometrically estimated with appropriate \nalgorithms. The ECM of the LAIDS (EC-LAIDS) used in this paper follows Ray \n(1985) and Blanciforti et al (1986) and is given by: \n \n11 *)\/log(log \u2212\u2212 +\u2206+\u2206+\u2206=\u2206 \u2211 iti\nj\nijijitii Pxbpww \u00b5\u03bb\u03b3\u03b4                (3) \n 6 \n \nwhere \u2206 refers to the difference operator, and 1\u2212it\u00b5  is the ECM term,  which measures \nthe feedback effects, and is estimated from the corresponding CI equation. i\u03b4 and i\u03bb  \nare the parameters that need to be estimated. The restrictions in the static LAIDS are \nalso applicable here.  \n \nApplications of the EC-LAIDS can be seen in the studies of demand for non-\ndurable goods, food and meat products, such as Balcombe and Davis (1996), Attfield \n(1997), Karagiannis and Velentzas (1997), Karagiannis et al (2000) and Karagiannis \nand Mergos (2002). Durbarry and Sinclair (2003) introduced this approach to tourism \ndemand analysis. However, due to insignificant coefficients, all of the short-run \nindependent variables were deleted from their EC-LAIDS model. With such a \nrestricted model, the different behaviours of tourists in the long-run and short-run \ncould not be investigated. Moreover, the forecasting performance of the EC-LAIDS \nwas ignored in their study. The current paper, therefore, fills in these gaps in the \ntourism literature. \n \nModel estimation and restriction tests \nSince the sum of all expenditure shares in the LAIDS model is equal to unity, the \nresiduals variance-covariance matrix is singular. The usual solution is to delete an \nequation from the system and estimate the remaining equations, and then calculate the \nparameters in the deleted equation in accordance with the adding-up restrictions. The \nLAIDS model is commonly estimated using Zellner\u2019s (1962) iterative approach for \nseemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) in most empirical demand studies and this \nmethod is also employed in this paper.  \n \nWith regard to restriction tests for homogeneity, symmetry and the joint test for \nboth homogeneity and symmetry, the conventional methods include the Wald test, \nlikelihood ratio test and Lagrange multiplier test. However, simulation experiments \nhave shown that these tests have considerable bias towards rejection of the null \nhypothesis, especially when they are applied to large demand systems with relatively \nfew observations (Laitinen 1978; Meinser 1979; Bera et al 1981; Balcombe and Davis \n1996). Therefore, this study applies two sample-size-corrected statistics (see \nAppendix 1) developed by Court (1968) and Deaton (1974) to avoid the over-\nrejection of the null hypotheses.  \n \nEMPIRICAL RESULTS \nThe data \nBoth the static and EC-LAIDS models are estimated using data on the demand for \ntourism to Western Europe by United Kingdom residents. There are twenty-two \ndestinations involved: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, \nGermany, Gibraltar, Greece, Iceland, Irish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, \nNetherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and former \nYugoslavia. Western Europe is the most popular destination area for UK residents, \nwith tourist spending in this region accounting for 14.8 billion pounds in 2000, which \nis 61.1% of the total demand. Within this area, France, Spain, Italy, Greece and \nPortugal are the major destinations, and tourist spending in these five countries \n 7 \naccounts for more than 50% of the total in the twenty-two Western European \ndestinations (68.6% in 2000) (see Figure 1). Therefore, this study focuses on these \nfive destinations, with the other seventeen aggregated to a single group as Others. \n \nFIGURE 1 \nSHARES OF UK TOURIST SPENDING IN WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES \n(2000) \n \nFrance\n21.6%\nGreece\n7.3%\nItaly\n7.8%\nPortugal\n4.0%\nSpain\n27.9%\nOthers\n31.4%\n \n \n  \nThe prices employed here are relative (or effective) prices, calculated by dividing \nthe price\n2\n of each destination by that of the UK, adjusted by the appropriate exchange \nrates. The aggregated price for the Others group takes the form of Stone\u2019s price index. \nAll the prices are normalised to unity at the point of the base year (1995). Although \nthe expenditure data relate to all travelling purposes, they are highly correlated with \nthe expenditure data on holidays, as pleasure travel has been dominating the tourism \nin the key destinations within the whole region concerned (see Table 1). Therefore, \nthe results of the estimated LAIDS model can reflect the characteristics of the \npleasure travel. The per capita expenditure is calculated and used in the model \nestimation in order to account for the effect of population size changes over time. In \nthis empirical study, a three-stage budgeting process is followed. It is assumed that \ntourists first allocate their consumption expenditure between total tourism \nconsumption and consumption of other goods and services. In the second stage, \ntourists allocate their expenditure between tourism in Western Europe and in other \nregions. In the last stage, tourists make their decisions among the alternative \ndestinations in Western Europe. The LAIDS models are applied to the last stage of \ntourism expenditure allocation. \n \nTABLE 1 \nRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TOURIST EXPENDITURE FOR HOLIDAYS AND \nFOR ALL PURPOSES (1995-2001) \n \nFrance Greece Italy Portugal Spain \nWestern \nEurope \n                                                           \n2\n Most empirical studies on tourism demand use CPI as a proxy for the tourism price. Econometric \nevidence has shown that the use of this proxy does not cause major conceptual or econometric \ndistortions (Witt and Witt 1992). \n 8 \nCorrelation \nCoefficient \n0.97 1.00 0.96 0.99 1.00 0.99 \nAverage \nproportion (%) \n64.3 91.8 67.3 88.3 90.4 70.6 \n \nThe data on prices, exchange rates and population are collected from the \nInternational Financial Statistical Yearbook (International Monetary Fund, various \nissues), and the expenditure data are collected from Travel Trends (Office for \nNational Statistics, UK, various issues). The data set covers the period 1972-2000. \n \nModel estimation \nThe ADF test for unit roots suggests that all the variables in the long-run LAIDS \nare I(1), and the long-run equilibrium relationships cannot be rejected by the Engle-\nGranger approach at the 5% significance level in any case.\n3\n Therefore, the \nunrestricted long-run static LAIDS models are estimated using the iterative SUR \nmethod. With regard to the dynamic LAIDS, the Engle and Granger two-step \napproach is employed for estimating CI regressions. The residuals from these \nregressions are calculated and incorporated into Equation (3), and then the \nunrestricted EC-LAIDS is estimated. The estimates are shown in Tables 2 and 3.  \nThe estimated parameters i\u03b4  in the EC-LAIDS are all significantly different from \nzero except in the Italian equation, which indicates that habit persistence plays an \nimportant role in UK tourists\u2019 decision-making process. In other words, the previous \ndistribution of tourism expenditure in different destinations influences UK tourists\u2019 \ncurrent decision on destination choice. The coefficients of error correction terms are \nall statistically significant at the 1% level and correctly signed, suggesting that any \ndeviations of tourist spending from the long-run equilibrium are dynamically \ncorrected, and hence the specification of a dynamic LAIDS is appropriate.  \n                                                           \n3\n The results are not presented due to space constraints, but are available from the authors upon request. \n 9 \n \n \nTABLE 2 \nESTIMATES OF THE UNRESTRICTED STATIC LAIDS \n France Greece Italy Portugal Spain \nia  \n0.176 \n(10.887) \n0.024 \n(1.884) \n0.116 \n(13.889) \n-0.001 \n(-0.148) \n0.142 \n(5.669) \n1i\u03b3  \n-0.068 \n(-1.143) \n0.057 \n(1.190) \n0.038 \n(1.249) \n-0.007 \n(-0.291) \n0.132 \n(1.429) \n2i\u03b3  \n-0.111 \n(-2.104) \n-0.129 \n(-3.032) \n0.068 \n(2.496) \n0.008 \n(0.360) \n0.064 \n(0.774) \n3i\u03b3  \n-0.140 \n(-4.624) \n-0.047 \n(-1.926) \n-0.021 \n(-1.314) \n0.050 \n(4.001) \n0.094 \n(1.995) \n4i\u03b3  \n0.128 \n(3.176) \n-0.039 \n(-1.196) \n-0.047 \n(-2.260) \n-0.032 \n(-1.963) \n-0.108 \n(-1.727) \n5i\u03b3  \n0.181 \n(5.305) \n0.074 \n(2.693) \n-0.024 \n(-1.340) \n0.020 \n(1.463) \n-0.270 \n(-5.101) \n6i\u03b3  \n-0.096 \n(-1.414) \n0.047 \n(0.862) \n-0.058 \n(-1.661) \n-0.019 \n(-0.678) \n0.225 \n(2.128) \nib  \n0.007 \n(1.974) \n0.009 \n(3.270) \n-0.009 \n(-4.934) \n0.008 \n(5.686) \n0.027 \n(4.899) \n2R  0.895 0.792 0.826 0.849 0.561 \nDW 2.24 1.31 1.66 1.80 2.21 \nNotes: the estimates in bold type are significant at the 5% significance level.

This implies that in the long run tourists are more flexible in response to price \nchanges. In the short run, due to various reasons such as information asymmetry and \nbounded rationality, tourists cannot fully adjust their behaviours when the price \nchange occurs. This conclusion is consistent with demand theory. Comparing the \nmagnitude of elasticities across destinations, UK tourists seem to be the most sensitive \nto price variations in Greece, while the demand for tourism to Italy appears to be the \nleast price elastic. These results hold regardless of whether the long run or short run is \nconsidered. \n \nAs far as the cross-price elasticities are concerned, the calculated results in both the \nlong run and short run are reported in Table 9, along with the corresponding results \n 14 \nfrom previous studies. In order to provide robust results, two criteria are followed to \nselect elasticities for examination, that is, the statistical significance in at least one of \nthe long-run and short-run elasticities and consistency of signs between long-run and \nshort-run elasticities. Compared with the previous literature, consistent substitution \neffects can be found in the following pairs of destinations: France and Spain (same as \nthe results obtained by De Mello et al 2002 and Papatheodorou 1999), and Italy and \nPortugal (same as Papatheodorou 1999). The substitutability between the pairs of \ndestinations is associated with their similar geographic features and cultural \nbackgrounds. Therefore, if tourism prices in one destination (e.g. France) increase, \ntourists are likely to choose to go to the competing destination (e.g. Spain). However, \nthe results show that the degree of substitution between the two destinations is \ndifferent. For example, in the long run, if the prices in Spain increase by 1%, the \ndemand for France will increase by 1.15%. On the other hand, if the prices in France \nincrease by 1%, the demand for Spain will increase by only 0.77%. This indicates that \nFrance has gained more competitiveness over Spain in attracting UK tourists\u2019 \nexpenditure. In addition to the substitution effect, the complementary effect is also \nidentified between Greece and Italy, which is in line with the results of Papatheodorou \n(1999) and Syriopoulos and Sinclair (1993). The complementary effect occurs when \nUK tourists take multiple-destination trips, i.e. the voyage effect holds (see \nPapatheodorou 1999). A new outcome that has not been explored before refers to the \nsubstitutability between France and Greece, especially in the short run. With respect \nto the magnitudes of the elasticities, the values are lower than unity in terms of \nabsolute values with only one exception. Comparing with the own-price elasticities, \nthe cross-price elasticities show that the demand for tourism in a destination by UK \nresidents is much less sensitive to price changes in the alternative destinations. For \nexample, in terms of UK\u2019s long-run demand for Spanish tourism, a 1% increase in \nSpanish prices would lead to a 1.52% decrease in demand for Spanish tourism, while \nthe price changes in Greece, Italy and Portugal would not result in significant changes \nin the demand for Spain. It implies that other factors beyond prices may play more \nimportant roles in the competition between tourism products of different destinations. \n \nComparing various demand elasticities in this study with those in the previous \nliterature, it is common to see discrepancies, which possibly result from differences in \nthe groupings of destination countries (White 1985), estimation methods, sample \nperiods, definitions of the variables, budget shares ( ini ww  \/ ) used for estimating \nelasticities, and so on. \n 15 \nTABLE 9 \nCOMPENSATED CROSS-PRICE ELASTICITIES: CALCULATED AND \nPREVIOUS LITERATURE \n France Greece Italy Portugal Spain  \n      L1 \n      L2 \nFrance    0.09 1.45 L3_2 \n  0.19 -0.16 0.08 1.15 Static LAIDS \n  0.26 0.01 -0.08 0.78 EC-LAIDS \n   -0.23 0.56 1.22 L1 \n   -0.98 1.06 1.16 L2 \nGreece      L3_2 \n 0.48  -0.03 -0.43 0.23 Static LAIDS \n 0.65  -0.51 0.29 -0.09 EC-LAIDS \n  -0.04  -0.83 0.41 L1 \n    0.25 1.09 L2 \nItaly      L3_2 \n -0.35 -0.03  0.33 -0.11 Static LAIDS \n 0.01 -0.46  0.34 0.18 EC-LAIDS \n  0.53 -4.40  4.08 L1 \n      L2 \nPortugal 0.44    1.27 L3_2 \n 0.35 -0.80 0.69  -0.05 Static LAIDS \n -0.35 0.53 0.71  -0.50 EC-LAIDS \n  0.20 0.37 0.70  L1 \n      L2 \nSpain 1.73   0.23  L3_2 \n 0.77 0.06 -0.03 -0.01  Static LAIDS \n 0.52 -0.02 0.05 -0.07  EC-LAIDS \nNotes: same as Tables 2, 7 and 8. \n \n \nFORECASTING PERFORMANCE \n \nForecasting ability is an important aspect of evaluating the performance of an \neconometric model. Forecasting tourism market shares and their relative changes \namongst the competing destinations is very important for destination management. \nMany published studies on tourism forecasting show that the demand for tourism has \nalways been growing over time. But in a demand system, when some destinations are \npredicted to gain more market shares, the others must suffer from the loss of their \nrelative competitiveness. Therefore, accurate market share predictions should provide \nthe destination government and tourism organisations with useful information for \ncompetitiveness analysis and strategy formulation. This is an additional advantage of \n 16 \nthe system of equations models, in particular the AIDS model, over the single-\nequation approach. On account of the importance of market share forecasting, it is \nnecessary to evaluate the forecasting performance of the static and dynamic LAIDS.  \nSince the static LAIDS does not include any lagged variables, only one-year ahead \nforecasts are comparable with those generated by the EC-LAIDS. Due to the failure to \npass the symmetry restriction test, the static symmetry-restricted LAIDS suffers from \nmisspecification, hence we use the unrestricted LAIDS to illustrate the difference in \nforecast performance between the static and dynamic systems.   \n \nBefore conducting forecasting tests, it is necessary to examine parameter stability \nbetween the estimating period (1972-1996) and forecasting period (1997-2000). In \nthis study, the statistic proposed by Anderson and Mizon (1983) (see Appendix 2) is \nutilised.  The calculated statistics for both the static and EC-LAIDS models are less \nthan the critical value at the 5% significance level, indicating that there is no evidence \nof parameter changes over the forecasting period, so the models concerned are \nsuitable for generating forecasts.  \n \nBoth the static and dynamic unrestricted systems are re-estimated, first using the \nobservations from 1972 up to 1996, and then one more observation being added each \ntime, until the observations up to 1999 are used. Hence 4 one-year-ahead forecasts are \nobtained for each destination, and 20 for the whole system. The forecasts generated by \nthe EC-LAIDS refer to differenced variables, which are then transformed into levels \nvariables in order to compare the results with those from the static LAIDS. The \ncomparisons are based on both individual equations (destinations) and the whole \nsystem (region). The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the root mean \nsquare percentage error (RMSPE) are considered for both destination-specific and \nsystem-specific comparisons of forecasting accuracy (Witt and Witt, 1992). The \nresults presented in Table 10 show that the EC-LAIDS always outperforms the static \nLAIDS, no matter which destination is concerned, and, moreover, the EC-LAIDS is \n41.5% and 48.4% more accurate than the static LAIDS in general, judged by the \nMAPE and RMSPE, respectively. This result is not surprising, as the EC-LAIDS \nincorporates the dynamic correction mechanism, and therefore tends to capture the \nshort-term variations more precisely. The similar result can also be found in \nChambers and Nowman (1997). \n \nTABLE 10 \nFORECASTING ACCURACY COMPARISON BETWEEN STATIC AND \nDYNAMIC UNRESTRICTED LAIDS \nStatic LAIDS EC-LAIDS \nDestination \nMAPE RMSPE MAPE RMSPE \nFrance 0.032 0.051 0.020 0.022 \nGreece 0.261 0.333 0.130 0.159 \nItaly 0.105 0.116 0.063 0.072 \nPortugal 0.153 0.171 0.098 0.099 \nSpain 0.023 0.026 0.024 0.033 \nWhole system 0.115 0.177 0.067 0.091 \n \n 17 \nCONCLUDING REMARKS \nIn this study, the UK demand for tourism in Western Europe has been examined \nusing both the long-run static and the short-run EC-LAIDS models. Five destinations \nare considered in this study: France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. The tests for \nhomogeneity and symmetry suggest that the dynamic version of the LAIDS satisfies \ndemand theory well, and that the short-run adjustment should not be ignored when \nexamining the demand for Western European tourism by UK residents. Various \nelasticities have been calculated and the results provide a basis for tourism \npolicymaking in these destinations.  \n \nThe calculated expenditure elasticities show that travel to most major destinations \nin Western Europe appears to be a luxury for UK tourists in the long run. However, a \nchange in total tourist expenditure tends to have different influences on the demand \nfor alternative destinations.  This indicates different positions of these destinations in \nattracting the demand their tourism by UK residents (measured by per capita \nexpenditure). Portugal and Greece appear to benefit more from the increase in UK \ntourists\u2019 expenditure in the booming period while they may suffer more from the \neconomic recession in the UK. Hence it is important for Portugal and Greece to \nclosely monitor the economic cycles in the UK.  \n \nAs far as the own-price elasticities are concerned, UK tourists are more sensitive to \nprice changes in the destinations in the long run than in the short term. The demand \nfor outbound UK tourism is most sensitive to price changes in Greece and least \nsensitive to price changes in Italy.  For the relatively price-elastic destinations, a \ncareful control in tourism prices relative to those in neighbouring counties would \nbenefit the growth of the tourism industry, which in turn would bring more foreign \nexchange earnings to the destinations. With regard to the private sectors, it should be \nnoted that reducing prices is not necessarily the appropriate strategy to gain the \ncompetitiveness against the rivals, because it may cause retaliatory measures.  \n \nThe cross-price elasticities indicate that France and Spain are likely to be \nsubstitutes in the minds of UK tourists, and also Italy and Portugal, and France and \nGreece. Having been aware of their strongest competitors, these destinations should \nkeep a keen eye on their competitors\u2019 actions in tourism product promotion, and carry \nout quick counteracting strategies in response. To some extent, the complementary \neffect occurs between Italy and Greece for UK tourists. This implies that the joint \npromotion campaigns by both destinations can be considered in order to maximise \ntheir gains from the growing tourism flows from the UK. Comparing with other \ndemand elasticities, the values of the cross-price elasticites are relatively small. This \nindicates that reducing prices does not have significant influences on attracting more \ntourist expenditure from the competitors. The implication for tourism businesses is \nthat the strategies of developing new products, improving product qualities and \nfocusing on differentiated market segments seem to be more appropriate in sustaining \nor enhancing their competitiveness. \n \nWith respect to forecasting tourism market shares, the dynamic LAIDS generates \nconsiderably more accurate results than the static LAIDS suggesting that the dynamic \nLAIDS should be used in predicting the changes in destination competitiveness.  \n \n 18 \nTo conclude, this study provides a new insight into the UK tourists\u2019 dynamic \nbehaviour in their expenditure budget allocation to different destinations. The \nempirical results, for the first time in the tourism context, demonstrate the superiority \nof the EC-LAIDS over the conventional static counterpart in terms of functional form, \nelasticity analysis and forecasting accuracy. Based on strong theoretical grounds, the \nEC-LAIDS provides more reliable information for policy evaluation than the single-\nequation approach. The limitation of this study is associated with lack of data \navailability, and the lack of disaggregated data on spending on leisure travel restricts \nthe empirical analysis. Therefore, the results obtained should be treated with some \ncaution.     \n \nAPPENDIX \n1.
