The basic principles of this tradition are \ncommonly understood by most practitioners to involve accounting for the consumption \nand accumulation of produced, human and natural capital, assuming the different capital \nstocks are infinitely substitutable (weak sustainability). One particular indicator that \nshares this basis and has been the subject of considerable attention and data gathering \nover the last decade is genuine savings (hereafter GS). In this chapter, we introduce and \ncritically appraise GS. \n  \nThe basic meaning of genuine savings \n \nGS sets out to measure whether we are dis-saving, that is, whether we allow \nappreciation of total capital to exceed investment in all forms of capital. The term \n\u2018genuine\u2019 was coined by Hamilton (1994) to reflect the fact that GS includes all forms \nof capital, not just produced capital i . In common with the wider green national \naccounting literature, GS traces its roots back to the work of neoclassical economists \nRobert Solow (1974) and John Hartwick (1977), who were concerned with modelling a \ndevelopment path in which social welfare or well-being does not decline in an economy \nexploiting a non-renewable resource. The problem is one of maximising the present \nvalue of social welfare over all time, given a range of simplifying assumptions that will \nbe critically discussed below. Solving this maximisation problem yields green net \nnational product or gNNP, which is equal to society\u2019s consumption plus the sum of net \nchanges in all the capital stocks valued at their shadow prices.  These shadow prices are \nthe prices that would exist in an inter-temporally efficient economy without externalities \n(this is one such assumption). \n \ngNNP = consumption + net investment in produced capital \u2013 net \ndepreciation of natural capital + investment in human capital \n \nSubtracting consumption leaves us with net changes in all the capital stocks valued at \ntheir shadow prices, which is GS. Without pursuing a formal derivation (see Hamilton \nand Clemens, 1999); \n 3 \n \nGS = net investment in produced capital \u2013 net depreciation of natural capital + \ninvestment in human capital \n \nIn what equates to a modification to the so-called Hartwick rule ii , the aim of the \nsustainability planner is to keep GS above or equal to zero. This is a necessary (but not \nsufficient) condition for ensuring sustainability under the weak sustainability paradigm. \nIf GS is persistently below zero, then the economy is not sustainable, since future utility \nmust be below current utility at some point (Hamilton and Clemens, 1999). Keeping GS \ngreater than or equal to zero is necessary but not sufficient to ensure sustainability. \nAsheim (1994) and Pezzey and Withagen (1995) showed that, if the economy has had \npersistently negative GS in the past, then positive GS at some later point in time is \ninsufficient to guarantee sustainability. But the sustainability planner does not have the \nluxury of hindsight. This means that GS is at best a one-sided indicator. We will reprise \nthis issue below. \n Though the difference between gNNP and GS is a fine one, it turns out that \nsubtracting consumption from gNNP to arrive at GS is an important conceptual step. As \nAtkinson et al. (1997) argued, the direct implications of gNNP for sustainability are \nlimited. Consider Repetto et al.\u2019s (1989) pioneering estimates of gNNP for Indonesia. \nThey estimated gross product grew at 7.1% per annum (p.a.) between 1971 and 1984, \nbut gNNP only grew at 4.1% p.a. over the same period. One could usefully conclude \nthat \u2018genuine\u2019 growth (minus depreciation of natural and produced capital) was \nsomeway short of that apparently indicated by gross product. Since one of the principal \nobjectives of green national accounting has been to act as a counterweight to \nconventional gross product, this is a useful result and the direction of the adjustment is \nintuitive. There is also a theoretical meaning to gNNP, because it measures extended \n\u2018Hicksian\u2019 national income: in other words, the maximum amount of produced output \nthat can be consumed at some point in time while maintaining constant wealth. \nHowever, it is difficult to interpret the still positive growth rate of 4.1% p.a.. Arguably, \nwhat one should be interested in are changes in total wealth less consumption: that is, \nGS. As was mentioned already, maintaining non-negative GS is a direct one-sided \nindicator of (weak) sustainability. \n \n 4 \nEmpirical estimates of genuine savings \n \nPearce and Atkinson (1993) produced initial GS estimates for 18 countries. Since then, \nthe GS mantle has very much been assumed by the World Bank (see, for example, \nWorld Bank 2003), which now regularly publishes a comparatively comprehensive GS \nmeasurement exercise for over 150 countriesiii. In simplified form, the World Bank \noperationalises GS, which it now calls \u2018Net Adjusted Savings\u2019 \u2013 as follows: \n \nGS =  investment in man-made capital \u2013 net foreign borrowing + net \nofficial transfers \u2013 depreciation of man-made capital \u2013 net \ndepreciation of natural capital + current education expenditures \n \n\u0001 Investment in produced capital, net foreign borrowing and net official transfers \nare obtained from the national accounts. Although depreciation of produced \ncapital is not, estimates can be derived from data on produced capital formation. \nThe World Bank uses estimates from the United Nations Statistics Division. \n\u0001 Net depreciation of natural capital can be divided at a basic level into resource \nextraction on the one hand and environmental pollution on the other. The Bank \nestimates resource extraction for a range of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, hard \ncoal and brown coal), minerals (bauxite, copper, iron, lead, nickel, zinc, \nphosphate, tin, gold and silver), and one renewable resource (forests). \nDepreciation of these resources is computed as the product of price minus \naverage costs of extraction multiplied by the volume of extraction: \n \n  (P-AC)*R        (1) \n \nwhere P is the resource price, AC is average cost and R is the volume of \nextraction (in the case of a renewable resource, R represents harvest beyond \nnatural regeneration). Environmental pollution is conceptualised as the use of \nsink capacity in order for it to be equivalent to capital depreciation. Until \nrecently, environmental pollution was taken to be the estimated damage cost of \ncarbon dioxide emissions where each ton of carbon emitted is valued at US$20 \nper metric tonne of carbon (from Fankhauser, 1995).  In its most recent \nestimation (2003), it added the damage costs of particulates in the air. \n 5 \n\u0001 Investment in human capital is calculated as net educational expenditures. This \nincludes both capital expenditures as well as current expenditures that are \ncounted as consumption rather than investment in the traditional national \naccounts. This is certainly rather crude, but it is difficult to see how investment \nin human capital could be estimated otherwise for so many countries over such a \nlong time horizon. Dasgupta (2001a, p.C9f.) argues that it is an overestimate \nsince human capital is lost when people die. But part of the human capital stock \nmight be passed on when people die or, to be precise, leave the workforce. In \nany case, such a correction would be difficult to undertake. \n \nFigure 1 shows estimated GS for the major world regions and global GS between 1976 \nand 2000. Global GS and GS in the OECD countries, East Asia and South Asia have \nalways been positive. In practicality then, these regions and the world as a whole have \npassed the one-sided GS test: they have apparently not been unsustainable over the past \n25 years or so. Latin America and the Caribbean had negative GS for a time during the \nearly 1980s, but the worst savers have been Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the \nMiddle East. In Sub-Saharan Africa, GS has been negative since the early 1980s. In \nNorth Africa and the Middle East, they have always been negative.  \n \n <FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE> \n \nOne conclusion we can draw from this data is that the regions with the greatest natural \nresource extraction are also the poorest performers in terms of GS (Neumayer, 2003). \nThis is also true at the national level of analysis. Figure 2 plots time-averaged national \nGS rates against an indicator of resource abundance: the share of fuel and mineral \nexports in total exports. With the exception of Algeria and Guinea, for whom GS was \njust above zero for the period 1970-2001, every country with an average share of fuel \nand mineral exports in total exports of over 60% had negative GS. In contrast, most \nresource-poor countries, especially the cluster of countries with an average share of fuel \nand mineral exports in total exports of under 20%, had positive GS. In Sub-Saharan \nAfrica, it must also be said that net produced capital investment is often negative too. In \nother words, the total \u2018man-made\u2019 wealth of these countries is also decreasing, and the \nWorld Bank\u2019s estimates of net natural capital depreciation simply worsen the situation. \nThis is the case in Guinea-Bissau, for example. The surprising element of the World \n 6 \nBank\u2019s results is that some heavy resource extractors appear more unsustainable than \nintuition would suggest (Neumayer, 1999, 2003). Saudi Arabia is the clearest example \nof this. It is hugely unsustainable according to the World Bank, but still has vast \nreserves of oil and natural gas. It turns out that calculating natural capital depreciation \naccording to a different method produces a more plausible outcome (see below).  \n \n <FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE> \n \nThe positive contribution of genuine savings \n \nAs we have pointed out, one of the strongest aspects of GS, at least from the perspective \nof influencing policy, is the fact that it acts as a counterweight to traditional systems of \nnational accounting. Although GNP and GDP do not (and indeed were never intended \nto) measure welfare, in practice they tend to be construed in exactly that way and thus \nGS is a related but much more holistic indicator. For example, in 2001 global gross \nsavings amounted to +23.9% of global gross income, whereas global genuine savings \nwere only +12.9% of global gross income. In the Middle East and North Africa, gross \nsavings were +26.9% of gross income, whereas genuine savings were \u20135.9% of gross \nincome (World Bank, 2003), indicating unsustainability. Furthermore, although we have \nreservations about the very low GS estimates in certain resource-rich countries, the \nbasic empirical outcome is a valid one for policy: certain resource-rich countries need to \ninvest more of the proceeds of natural capital into the formation of other forms of \ncapital than they currently do. \nBeyond this, we can praise the significant research effort that the GS agenda has \ngenerated on two fronts. The first concerns the emerging data set that is being amassed. \nThe World Bank has compiled an impressive database on resource extraction and this is \nsubject to regular updates (see Kunte et al., 1998 and World Bank, 1997). In most cases, \nthe data are taken from external sources, but the effort involved in this is not to be \nunderestimated and in any case they still have to be converted into a form apt to adjust \ngross savings. Progress is also being made on the estimation of environmental pollution \ndamage. Until recently, this component of GS was confined to carbon dioxide emissions, \nbut the Bank has begun to include particulate emissions too. These are quantified based \non its own estimates of marginal willingness-to-pay to avoid mortality caused by \nairborne particulates (equivalent to the shadow price of the stock of particulate \n 7 \nemissions: Pandey et al., 2003). Hopefully we will see more pollutants included in the \nnear future. For example, tropospheric ozone pollution would be a valuable addition, as \nwould organic pollution of waterways. \nThe second impressive outcome of the GS research effort is the theoretical \ndevelopment of the topic, which has not only forwarded knowledge about GS, but also \nweak sustainability in general. Of course, it might seem rather odd to praise the \ndevelopment of a research area, something that is after all an inherent property of all \nresearch. But research on GS has meaningfully advanced the state-of-the-art since its \ninitial development in the early 1990s. We are now better placed to understand, for \nexample, the implications of different methods for calculating natural resource rents, \nand our understanding of the significance of per capita estimates of GS versus aggregate \nGS is also improving. Both of these issues are discussed below. We have also chosen \nnot to mention the theoretical development of the Hartwick rule, and the implications of \nthe optimal growth model. Important contributions include Asheim, Buchholz and \nWithagen (2003). Taking on board these improvements leads to a more sophisticated \nindicator than that initially advanced. \n \nCriticisms of genuine savings \n \nGS has come in for a series of criticisms since its inception, much as its competitors \nhave too. These have been discussed in the past by Neumayer (1999, 2003). We will \nnow outline a series of the most significant problems. We do not, however, discuss the \ngeneral advantages and disadvantages of green national accounting and other indicators \nof weak sustainability in comparison with indicators of strong sustainability (which \nassumes at least some natural capital is non-substitutable). The interested reader is \ndirected to other chapters in this volume <PHIL: ADD CROSS-REFERENCES HERE>. \nIt is nevertheless important to remember that the merit of GS as a policy-guiding \nindicator depends to a great extent on the wider paradigms to which it belongs. \n \nGS is based on a model of an inter-temporally efficient economy \n \nWe have already explained that, because GS is a point measure of total wealth in the \neconomy, it can only be a one-sided indicator of sustainability. The problem is then that \nan economy with positive GS is not necessarily sustainable. This is compounded by the \n 8 \nviolation of a basic assumption behind the model of GS: the economy develops along an \noptimal path over all time. In this inter-temporally efficient economy, there is \u201ca \ncomplete set of property rights (that is, no externalities) with competitive households \nand firms and a full set of forward markets where perfectly rational agents have perfect \ninformation and households take full account of the welfare of their actual or \nprospective descendants\u201d (Neumayer, 1999, p155). None of these conditions will hold \nin reality. Markets fail, especially markets for natural assets, which often do not exist. \nHence it is entirely possible that positive GS is associated with, among other things, \nnon-optimal natural resource prices, such that these assets are in fact being extracted \nunsustainably. This is of course hardly a revelation for environmental and resource \neconomists, whose discipline is founded in large part on the notion that natural \nresources are under-priced in the economy (see, for example, Pearce and Turner, 1989). \nIn the present context at least, knowing that the economy is inter-temporally \ninefficient might suggest a preference for those indicators of (strong) sustainability that \nset some exogenously defined environmental standard, and then measure the cost of \nattaining that standard. Indeed, Roefie Hueting, who pioneered this so-called \u2018hybrid\u2019 \napproach, explicitly recognises that his research agenda is a response to the \ninsurmountable problems facing the practitioner in constructing a theoretically sound \nindicator (Hueting, 1992). Three of the most important hybrid indicators are \nSustainability Gaps (Ekins and Simon, 1999, 2001), the Greened National Statistical \nand Modelling Procedures (GREENSTAMP: e.g. O\u2019Connor and Ryan, 1999) and \nSustainable National Income according to Hueting (SNI; Hueting, 1992). Hybrid \napproaches are generally regarded as indicators of strong sustainability, insofar as the \nstandards set are relatively stringent (see Neumayer, 2003), but in principle this need \nnot be the case. \n \nExogenous shocks to the GS model \n \nQuite apart from the unrealistic assumption of intertemporal efficiency, the GS model is \nvulnerable to shocks from outside the system. The difficulty with exogenous shocks is \nthat the prices existing at the outset will no longer be optimal and will not adequately \nreflect economic scarcities (Neumayer, 1999). Looking forward from the base year into \nthe future, there is once again no guarantee GS is giving the correct signals vis-\u00e0-vis \nsustainability. What should therefore happen after such a shock is that prices should be \n 9 \nre-estimated. Understandably, Hamilton (1995) rejects this approach as impracticable, \nand instead proposes that the assumption of efficient pricing is simply dropped. The \nparadox one ends up in, however, is that the whole method of accounting remains on \nsome level dependent on efficient pricing. Three particular types of exogenous shock \nare: \n \n1. Exogenous technological progress; \n2. Terms-of-trade effects; \n3. A non-constant discount rate. \n \n1. The GS model assumes stationary technology. This does not mean that there is \nno technological progress at all. In fact, as long as progress is embodied in one \nor other form of capital (in other words is endogenous to the GS model) its \neffect is accounted for in GS estimates. Instead, it is that fraction of future \ntechnological progress that is exogenous that requires the re-estimation of GS. \nEqually, exogenous technological progress will only be of interest provided it is \nnon-constant: otherwise it is simply the level of utility (gNNP) that is altered and \nnot the rate of change with time (GS). Presuming technological change does \nalter the rate of change of utility with time, GS can still be negative even with \nexpanded welfare possibilities, which means that society is losing its capacity to \nattain that higher level of well being. Alternatively, if exogenous technological \nprogress is contributing less over time to welfare relative to the base year, then \neven zero GS is insufficient for ensuring sustainability and positive GS is \nnecessary (Neumayer, 1999). In principle, it is possible to treat technological \nchange as an externality and quantify it, but it is very difficult even to \napproximate unanticipated future change. The adjustments can be very large or \nrather small (Pemberton and Ulph, 1998). \n2. The effects of changes in future terms-of-trade are obviously quite different for \nimporting and exporting countries, and are intuitive. If resource rents rise, then \nthe resource exporting country will be better off and the resource importing \ncountry worse off than initially predicted. Hence it is theoretically possible at \nleast that the exporting country is not unsustainable, even though its GS rate is \nnegative. Exactly the opposite is true if resource rents unexpectedly fall, due, for \n 10 \ninstance, to breakthroughs in the development of a substitute so-called backstop \ntechnology (for example, solar energy in the case of oil). \n3. Where the discount rate is non-constant, the meaning of GS estimates becomes \nsimilarly ambiguous. In particular, Asheim, Buchholz and Withagen (2003) \nshow that negative GS at any moment in time need not imply an economy is \nunsustainable. \n \nThe assumption of constant population \n \nThe basic model of GS, and our discussion thus far, has focussed on total wealth, and \npopulation has been assumed constant. Dasgupta (2001b) points out that this is a \nreasonable assumption over the very long run, but over the shorter run and especially in \nthe developing world it is less tenable. Thus attention has recently been cast on the \nquestion of measuring GS on a per capita basis. The reason for this is rather obvious: \none can envisage a situation in which GS is positive, but if population is growing at an \neven faster rate, then per capita wealth will actually be decreasing. On the face of it, the \nadjustment to GS that is required is conceptually straightforward (Hamilton 2003, p. \n426): \n \nP\nW\ndt\ndP\nP\ndt\ndW\nP\nW\ndt\nd\n\u2212=\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n       (2) \n \nwhere W is total wealth and P is population. dW\/dt is GS. Thus the per capita measure \nof GS is equal to the net change in total wealth per capita minus the product of total \nwealth per capita and the population growth rate. \nHamilton (2003) makes preliminary empirical estimates of GS per capita for 110 \ndeveloped and developing countries. But first he conducts a sensitivity analysis of the \nresults of GS per capita according to different population growth rates for the USA in \n1997. He concludes that GS per capita is responsive to population growth, and an \nincrease in p from 0.8% p.a. to 1.0% p.a., ceteris paribus, is sufficient to push GS per \ncapita below zero. On a country-by-country basis, the pattern of per capita estimates \nreflect the World Bank\u2019s aggregate estimates: it is the resource-rich countries of Sub-\nSaharan Africa, the Middle East and Northern Africa that tend to have the most negative \n 11 \nGS per capita. Clearly, having negative GS on aggregate automatically translates into \nnegative GS per capita (unless population growth is negative). But crucially some \ncountries with positive GS on aggregate have negative GS per capita: for example, \nJordan and Niger, for whom of course population growth rates are high. This \nemphasises the value in computing GS per capita alongside GS on aggregate. \nYet the problem of accounting for population growth may not be as simple. \nDasgupta (2001b) and Arrow et al. (2003) derive a fundamentally different formula for \nGS per capita, based on the inclusion of the stock of population in the social welfare \n(utility) function as a capital asset. As Asheim (2004) puts it, following this reasoning \nmakes instantaneous well being (which is what point estimates of GS measure) \ndependent on population size. This is the position of \u2018total utilitarianism\u2019. A simplified \nversion of Arrow et al.\u2019s (2003) GS per capita is therefore: \n \n GS =   net investment in capital (various forms) + population growth \n      population size \n \nOne might immediately object to the idea that a larger future population should be given \ngreater welfare weight because of just that. Arrow et al. (2003) argue that this weighting \nis in keeping with the simple principle of treating people equally (discounting \nnotwithstanding), and Dasgupta (2001b) also showed that the alternative position of \n\u2018average utilitarianism\u2019 has its own implications that may not be ethically defensibleiv. It \nis in any case not necessarily true that a larger future population receives more weight, \nceteris paribus, because population growth is valued in the GS function at its shadow \nprice, and this could be negative. The only restriction on the shadow price of population \ngrowth according to their derivation is that it may not equal zero. \nIf the above formula is applied, then an important question is what rate of \npopulation growth to choose. A common assumption in models with a growing \npopulation is that population growth is constant: that is, population grows exponentially. \nIn this case, the GS formula simply collapses to per capita GS as in Hamilton (2003). \nBut this is also an untenable assumption, because population growth is slowing \nworldwide. A more reasonable growth function to impute is logistic growth, where \npopulation initially grows exponentially, but later converges to a constant level. In this \ncase, if one decides to retain population in the social welfare function, then the modified \nArrow et al. method is the correct one. This is an emerging research agenda, and \n 12 \nimportant contributions are expected to follow in the next few years. In the meantime, \nwe conclude the relatively straightforward adjustment made in equation (2) is \nworthwhile. \n \nCalculating natural capital depreciation \n \nThe World Bank\u2019s method for calculating resource rents based on price minus average \ncost is problematic. This much was suggested by its empirical results, some of which \nappeared superficially odd. As we have mentioned, GS rates seem to be remarkably low \nin certain resource-rich countries. Neumayer (2000a) in particular asked if GS in North \nAfrica and the Middle East truly was as low as \u201330% of gross income at the end of the \n1970s, and if GS in Saudi Arabia, a nation with reserves of oil and natural gas that are \nstill enormous even now, was plausibly lower than \u201320% of gross income over most of \nthe Bank\u2019s 25 year measurement period? If these results were true, then the regions and \ncountries in question would consume the better part of their total capital stock within a \nmatter of decades, leading to economic collapse. Needless to say, we see no signs of \nthis happening. \nIn an inter-temporally efficient economy, calculating the depreciation of natural \ncapital is theoretically straightforward, being equal to the so-called total Hotelling rent \n(Hotelling, 1931; Hartwick, 1990; Hamilton, 1994, 1996; Neumayer, 1999, 2003): \n \n (P-MC)*R         (3) \n \nwhere MC is marginal cost. But data on marginal costs are very difficult to obtain in \nreality, so the Bank falls back on average costs as in equation (1). In fact, the Bank\u2019s \nmethod is just one of several. Of these, El Serafy (1981 1989, 1991) estimated natural \ncapital depreciation according to the following formula: \n \n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n+\n\u2212\n+1)1(\n1\n**)(\nn\nr\nRACP        (4) \n \nwhere r is the discount rate and n is the number of remaining years of the resource stock. \nn tends to be set equal to the static reserves to production ratio, which is the number of \nyears the reserve stock would last if production were maintained equivalent to the base \n 13 \nyear. Comparing (1) and (4), we can clearly see that if both r and n are large, then the \n\u2018El Serafy\u2019 method will produce a smaller estimate of natural capital depreciation, and it \nfollows that GS rates will be more positive, ceteris paribus. The \u2018El Serafy\u2019 method in \neffect partitions the rents from resource extraction into the \u2018user cost\u2019 of resource \nextraction \u2013 that is, the share of resource receipts that should properly be considered as \ncapital depreciation \u2013 and \u2018sustainable income\u2019 (in a Hicksian sense), which is a level of \nconsumption that can be sustained indefinitelyv. \nThe rather important difference between the \u2018El Serafy\u2019 method and the Bank\u2019s \nmethod is that the former does not depend on the assumption of inter-temporal \nefficiency and hence optimal prices. Since there is no reason to presume resource \npricing is efficient (see above), it is more defensible to employ a method that does not \ndepend on itvi. Furthermore, the Bank\u2019s method is in any case at best an approximation \nof the theoretically correct method, because it substitutes average costs for marginal \ncosts. To the extent that marginal costs are increasing (it becomes increasingly costly to \nextract successive units of a resource), then the application of average costs should \noverestimate the depreciation of natural capital. The \u2018El Serafy\u2019 method, on the other \nhand, uses average costs without apology, because it does not depend on marginal costs. \nIn response to questioning the realism of GS estimates for certain regions and \nnations, Neumayer (2000a) re-estimated GS using the \u2018El Serafy\u2019 method. Applying a \ndiscount rate (r) of 4% p.a., the regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the \nMiddle East no longer had negative GS, and most individual countries also passed from \nnegative GS into positive GS, particularly those with large remaining reserves relative \nto production. Other countries that continued to record negative GS had negative \nsavings irrespective of natural capital depreciation, while only a handful of countries \ncould still be said to be weakly unsustainable due in itself to unsustainable natural \nresource extraction. Auty and Mikesell (1998) provided similar results in the case of \nIndonesia. \nAll this seems to suggest that the \u2018El Serafy\u2019 method is superior to the Bank\u2019s \nmethod, but this may not be true in all cases. The method is very sensitive both to r and \nn, and there are problems associated with arriving at both values (Auty and Mikesell, \n1998). What is the correct discount rate is always an open question, and taking a high \nvalue of, say, 10% p.a. leads \u2018El Serafy\u2019 GS estimates to deviate even more from the \nBank\u2019s estimates (Neumayer, 2000a). It is equally unclear what values n should take, \nsince it requires predictions into the future and is thus troubled by uncertainty. We \n 14 \nexplained above that n is generally estimated as the static reserves to production ratio, \nbut reserves data are much less reliable in general than production data. Broadly, if r \nand n are both small, then the Bank\u2019s and the \u2018El Serafy\u2019 method converge somewhat, \nand the adjustment may not be meaningful. This will be true of r if it is of the order of \n4% p.a. or lower, and of n if it is around 20 years or lower. Scanning data from the US \nBureau of Mines (various years) tends to reveal that n lies between 20 and 30 in the case \nof many resources for many countries, so the Bank\u2019s method will not normally be far \noff the mark. Vis-\u00e0-vis Saudi Arabia and other countries with very large remaining \nreserves relative to production, the results generated by applying the Bank\u2019s method are \nnonsensical, but otherwise the Bank\u2019s method can still be usefully regarded as imposing \na conservative sustainability standard. \n \nAccounting for environmental pollution \n \nThe World Bank estimates the depreciation of natural capital due to environmental \npollution as the total damage cost of national carbon dioxide emissions. Fine particulate \nemissions were added in 2003, though the retrospective estimates of GS from 1970 to \nthe present day that we use do not include these. This is quite clearly a restrictive \napproach, and the Bank knowingly omits many other types of pollutant (including air \npollutants such as sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, water pollutants such as \nfaecal coliforms and ground contaminants such as heavy metals). The upshot of this \nmay well be, among other things, that developed countries are not as sustainable as one \nmight presume. Hamilton and Atkinson\u2019s (1996) results suggest this is the case: they \nestimated the damage cost of air pollution in the UK to be between 3% and 5% of GDP \nduring the 1980s, enough to push the UK\u2019s GS below zero for most of the early 1980s. \nThe Bank sees its hands tied in this respect: there simply are not enough data \navailable to estimate a comprehensive set of damage costs. It would be fair to say that, \nin general, of all the components of GS the damage costs of environmental pollution are \nthe most incomplete and \u2018approximate\u2019. There is even some debate as to how the value \nof environmental pollution should be calculated in the first place. Hamilton and \nAtkinson (1996) and the World Bank apply the damage cost approach, where emissions \nof the relevant pollutant (net of natural dissipation) are multiplied by their shadow price. \nOther studies have focussed on so-called maintenance costs, which reflect the cost of \nreturning the environment to some previous state based on marginal abatement costs \n 15 \n(e.g. Prince and Gordon, 1994). In an optimal economy, the two methods should \namount to the same, but we know this is not the case and it is hence likely that \nmaintenance costs, based on marginal pollution abatement costs, will understate the \ncosts of pollution (Prince and Gordon estimate the cost of air and water pollution in the \nUSA in the early 1980s to be only 1% of GDP: this is considerably lower than the \nHamilton and Atkinson estimate). But damage costs are not beyond censure themselves. \nMost are estimated in a partial equilibrium context as part of a cost-benefit analysis \n(CBA), but what is required for estimates to be compatible with systems of national \naccounting is a general equilibrium estimate. More research and practice is required \nhere too, but for the moment we can conclude that GS estimates, particularly in \ndeveloped countries, may be too high, ceteris paribus. \nIn the context of costing environmental pollution, there is also the controversial \nissue of transboundary and global pollution and how it is integrated into green national \naccounting. This particularly affects carbon dioxide emissions. Either one simply \nestimates the damage cost of pollution wherever it occurs, and hence certain countries \nwill pay the welfare price for others\u2019 emissions, or the damage cost of pollution is \nattributed to the emitting country. The latter is a basic application of the \u201cpolluter pays \nprinciple\u201d that now wields considerable influence in international environmental policy-\nmaking. On the other hand, the damage cost of emissions is not strictly speaking \nequivalent to the environmental capital stock that determines the impact of climate \nchange on a country\u2019s economy. Instead, it is the global concentration of carbon dioxide \nin the atmosphere, a function of global emissions, which does so (Ferreira and Vincent, \n2003). Clearly this decision will exert a considerable influence on GS rates. \nIn fact, it has a corollary in the case of accounting for resource extraction, \ninsofar as some have argued that the resources depleted in developing countries of the \nSouth for the purpose of consumption or capital accumulation in developed countries of \nthe North should properly be debited from the national accounts of the developed \ncountry. Again this adjustment significantly changes the distribution of GS rates, being \nmore positive for resource exporters and more negative for importers (Proops et al., \n1999). In this latter case, however, there is no real argument for adjustment. The \npurpose of estimating GS is to find out the magnitude of a nation\u2019s natural capital \ndepreciation as a share of total national capital formation. Negative GS rates, especially \nif caused by excessive exports to developed countries of the North, should indicate that \ndeveloping countries of the South need to invest more of the proceeds of natural capital \n 16 \ninto the formation of other forms of capital than they currently do. And the results \nshould also affect policy-making in the North. Developed countries should assist \ndeveloping countries experiencing negative GS rates in attempting to become \nsustainable. \nThere is no real case for following the same logic in respect of environmental \npollution, however. Strictly from the perspective of whom the natural capital (sink \nresource) belongs to, deductions should be made from the recipient country\u2019s GS. But \nthis is hardly the policy signal one wants to give in this context. Instead, it seems \ndifficult in principle to reject the notion that the polluter should \u201cpay\u201d, which is in \naccordance with the way the Bank values pollution. Also from a practical perspective, it \nis easier and safer to calculate damage cost estimates based on national emissions rather \nthan ambient emissions concentrations. \n \nConclusions on the policy usefulness of genuine savings \n \nWhether one believes in the policy-guiding value of GS depends at the outset on \nwhether one subscribes to the weak sustainability paradigm. Admittedly there have been \nmoves towards dealing with the non-substitutability of natural capital within the GS \nframework. Atkinson et al. (2003) propose that, as the asset base of some natural \nresource is depleted up to its critical level, the shadow price of the asset should \napproach infinity. In practical terms, the magnitude of the term for natural capital \ndepreciation becomes very large indeed. But there are at present limits to this approach. \nThe loss of critical natural capital still needs to be measured through marginal WTP, \nand this is difficult enough for incremental as opposed to very large losses of welfare. In \nessence, we are not currently equipped to measure the welfare value of losses of critical \nnatural capital. In that case, if one is concerned with strong sustainability, then GS \nresults are largely uninteresting. \nWithin the confines of the weak sustainability paradigm, we have praised GS as \na meaningful counterweight to gross product in the measurement of social welfare \n(understanding of course that gross product was never intended to be a measure of \nsocial welfare), and as an indicator with a direct (if one-sided) sustainability criterion. \nOn the other hand, the thrust of our discussion is that GS is a very rough measure of \nsustainability. The assumption of an inter-temporally efficient economy is undoubtedly \nproblematic, and thus even non-negative GS rates cannot really rule out unsustainable \n 17 \ndevelopment. In much the same way, the validity of point estimates of GS depends on \nthe absence of external shocks to the system. If there are any, then all prices, and in turn \nGS, would have to be re-estimated. These are fundamental problems for GS and we \nrecommend all GS estimates be accordingly interpreted with a great deal of caution. If \none seriously objects to the optimality assumption, then so-called hybrid indicators that \nabandon the search for optimality and instead measure the economic cost of some given \nstandard may be judged superior. We would not go so far, however. Although there is \ninsufficient scope here, it should be noted that the problems apparent in the hybrid \napproach are no less grave (see Neumayer, 1999, 2000b, 2003). \nThe measurement of natural capital depreciation is another problem for GS. We \nhave shown that GS estimates are sensitive to the method of calculating rents from \nresource extraction. The World Bank\u2019s estimates, by their own admission, are at the \nhigh end, and probably overestimate the unsustainability of certain resource-dependent \nregions and countries. Even patchier is the estimation of the value of environmental \npollution damage. At present, the World Bank judges there to be so few data that it can \nonly estimate the values of carbon dioxide and particulate pollution damage. Even in \nthese cases, the estimates of marginal pollution costs are very rough. In fact, this patchy \ndata coverage is also an issue for extractive resources. It is striking that the least \nsustainable regions and countries according to the World Bank are those heavily \ndependent on fossil fuels and minerals. \nTo summarise, the most useful policy suggestion to emerge from GS studies is \nthat certain resource-dependent countries need to invest more of the proceeds of natural \ncapital into the formation of other forms of capital than they currently do. On the other \nhand, the debate over calculating resource rents means that countries with still large \nremaining reserves of fossil fuels \u2013 mainly Saudi Arabia and some other Gulf States \u2013 \nare almost certainly more sustainable than the World Bank suggests. Other countries, \nhowever, that are heavily dependent on resources not included in the analysis such as \nfish or soil (via agriculture) may well be less sustainable. One can, for example, ask if \nSub-Saharan Africa would be even less weakly sustainable after calculating the \ndepletion of soils? In any case, the fact that its main results become reversed for some \ncountries if another, and not inferior, method for calculating natural capital depreciation \nis used, sheds great doubt on the validity and reliability and therefore on the policy \nusefulness of the measure. \n 18 \nFor developed countries, GS produces the result that everywhere weak \nunsustainability is avoided. This may or may not be true. These countries are not \nespecially resource-dependent, and do tend to invest significantly in capital formation, \nbut including a more comprehensive range of environmental pollutants would \nundoubtedly drive GS downwards. The really interesting policy outcome that currently \nevades is hence that some developed countries might be unsustainable on the grounds of \nexcess pollution. \nAt the present time then, GS provides some interesting if generic policy \nguidance to sustainability planners. Given improved coverage and estimation of natural \nresource depletion in the future, we may obtain more interesting and accurate results. \nGiven the restrictive assumptions of the method, however, and the fact that few if any \nenvironmental data can ever be considered truly accurate, it would be a mistake to \ninterpret GS rates too literally. \n \nReferences \n \nArrow, K.
