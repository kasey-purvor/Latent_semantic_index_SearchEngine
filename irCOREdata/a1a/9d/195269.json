There are opportunities to clarify the responsibility for health protection in England, perhaps learning from the\napproaches used for those health protection functions where we found consistent perceptions of accountability.\nBackground\nAre responsibilities for health protection in England clear?\nOne of the consequences of the 2002 changes to NHS\nstructures was a change in the organisations, and in some\ncases the individuals, responsible for health protection.\nPrimary Care Trusts (PCTs) took on the previous roles of\nDistrict Health Authorities, which had been defined in the\n1977 National Health Service (NHS) Act [1]. These\nincluded the duty to promote health, to provide services\nand to prevent and treat illness. Guidance to the health\nservice identified these as including \"arrangements for the\ncontrol of communicable disease and infections, and for\ndealing with the health aspects of non-communicable\nenvironmental hazards\" [2].\nFigure 1 shows how health protection responsibilities\nhave developed in England since 1977. It identifies key\nreports and consultations, national policy developments,\nand the organisations and workforce responsible for\nhealth protection. In the period up to 2002, responsibility\nfor health protection for any geographical area lay within\na single organisation, the District Health Authority. Their\nfunctions were clarified and strengthened following two\nmajor outbreaks. The first was an outbreak of food poi-\nsoning at Stanley Royd Hospital in 1984, which led to the\ndeaths of 19 patients, and the second an outbreak of\nlegionnaires disease in Stafford General Hospital in 1985,\nwhich caused the deaths of 22 people. A committee of\ninquiry into the Stanley Royd outbreak identified a lack of\nclear accountability for investigation and intervention as a\ncontributory factor [3], and at the time many District\nHealth Authorities did not have adequate capacity to\nrespond to such outbreaks [4]. As a result, a Government\nreview of public health (the Acheson report) led to Dis-\ntrict Health Authorities investing leadership in the post of\nthe Director of Public Health (DPH) with clear responsi-\nbility for public health and health protection [5]. This role\nwas further strengthened by the introduction of specialist\nConsultants in Communicable Disease Control, who led\nteams working to the DPH, incorporating surveillance,\nTB, community infection and outbreak control functions.\nFollowing the 2002 reorganisation of the NHS [6], the\nhealth protection responsibilities of District Health\nAuthorities transferred to PCTs, which retained the statu-\ntory role of Director of Public Health [1]. The specialist\nhealth protection workforce initially transferred to PCTs\nin support of their Directors of Public Health. It had long\nbeen recognised, however, that varying approaches had\nbeen taken to health protection between Health Authori-\nties, and further dispersal of responsibility across a much\nlarger number of PCTs would be likely to exacerbate this\n[7]. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) was established\na year later, aiming to create a stronger and more unified\nhealth protection system, and intending to bring together\nthe specialists involved in health protection in a single\norganisation with national specialist functions (such as\nspecialist laboratory and epidemiological services, mak-\ning these more akin to the Centers for Disease Control in\nthe United States) and local health protection teams [8].\nThis development aimed to provide a national focus and\nconsistency to the delivery of health protection. The spe-\ncialist health protection workforce largely moved into the\nHPA, apart from those carrying out community infection\ncontrol functions who remained within PCTs.\nOn its establishment in 2003 the HPA was responsible for\nsupporting other bodies, including PCTs, in carrying out\ntheir health protection roles [9]. The HPA Act of 2004 also\ngave it direct responsibility for protecting the community\nfrom infectious and non infectious environmental haz-\nards. However, PCTs were still statutorily responsible for\narrangements for the control of communicable disease\nand non-infectious environmental hazards, as defined in\nthe 1993 guidance to the health service [1].\nHence up to 2002 there was a single organisation respon-\nsible at a local level for health protection, but there was\nsignificant variation across England in health protection\npractice. After 2004, there was a much greater critical mass\nwithin the national HPA and the potential for more\nnational consistency of practice, but at a local level both\nPCTs and the HPA had statutory responsibilities for health\nprotection. Unless the roles of each organisation were\nclearly defined, there was the potential for individuals\nlocally to be unclear about their leadership and support\nroles in carrying out different health protection functions.\nPrior to the establishment of the HPA and PCTs, Health\nAuthorities employed teams to provide their specialist\nhealth protection functions. These included: consultants\nin communicable disease control responsible for the full\nrange of health protection functions; infection control\nand TB control nurses, responsible for infection control in\nprimary and community care facilities and for TB control;\nsurveillance staff responsible for surveillance of notifiablePage 2 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2006, 6:297 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/6\/297and other important infectious diseases; and administra-\ntive support staff. Despite PCTs retaining statutory respon-\nsibilities for health protection from 2003, they largely\nrelied on local Health Protection Agency teams (Health\nProtection Units \u2013 HPUs) to provide this service on their\nbehalf. HPUs mainly consist of the specialist staff previ-\nously employed by Health Authorities, aside from com-\nmunity infection control nurses who mostly remained\nwith PCTs.\nThe local arrangements to hold HPUs to account for pro-\nviding this service are based on a Memorandum of Under-\nstanding. This is based on a national template but has no\nlegal or statutory basis, and it is not expected on its own\nto achieve uniformity of arrangements across England. It\nsimply reflects agreements between the HPA and the local\nNHS, for example identifying the role of the HPU in mon-\nitoring and surveillance to give early warning of outbreaks\nof infection, and the responsibility of the PCT in commu-\nnity infection control. In the case of a community out-\nbreak, it usually identifies the Director of Public Health as\nhaving overall responsibility for managing the response to\nthe outbreak, and the HPU for carrying out most outbreak\ncontrol functions on their behalf.\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that, whilst arrangements\noften work well, implementation has varied across Eng-\nland, partly reflecting the inherited NHS variation in serv-\nice provision. This variation may also reflect variation in\ngeographical distribution of public health specialists\nresponsible for health protection as well as wider public\nhealth functions[10]. It might also reflect the dispersal of\nthe public health workforce following the 2002 NHS\nchanges, and the skills gaps identified in the wider public\nhealth workforce, particularly in health protection[11].\nAlongside the fact that both PCTs and the HPA have stat-\nutory health protection roles, these factors may add to a\nlack of clarity about who is responsible for delivering spe-\ncific health protection functions locally, and a lack of\ncapacity to deliver those functions.

Inquiries into past health protection incidents\nin different countries have often identified a lack of clarity\nas to who is responsible as a major contributing factor\n[3,12,13]. Equally there is widespread international recog-\nnition that systematised responses with clear responsibil-\nities for health protection and other healthcare incidents,\nare required for responses to be effective. This includes the\ncontrol of infection [14,15], disaster planning [16,17] and\npatient safety [18].\nThe purpose of this survey was to assess the extent of var-\niation in the interpretation of health protection arrange-\nments between PCTs and local health protection teams. In\nparticular it aimed to investigate the perceptions of those\nwho are involved in delivery and oversight of health pro-\ntection as to whose responsibility it is to deliver specific\nhealth protection functions, who delivers them in reality,\nand to identify issues that need urgent attention. Under-\nstanding any differences in perceptions can then inform\nboth the development of the Health Protection Agency\nand of PCTs, particularly as new arrangements develop in\nthe light of current NHS organisational changes[19]. It is\nalso of relevance to judging the adequacy of health protec-\ntion arrangements in different countries.\nMethods\nWe undertook a questionnaire survey of key health profes-\nsionals responsible for health protection in England dur-\ning 2005.\nParticipants\nThe participants in this study were: (a) Directors of Public\nHealth in Primary Care Trusts; (b) Directors of Health\nProtection Units within the Local and Regional Services\nDivision of the Health Protection Agency; (c) Directors of\nPublic Health\/Medical Directors in Strategic Health\nAuthorities and; (d) Regional Directors of the Health Pro-\ntection Agency [see Additional File 1 for further details of\nsampling frame].\nQuestionnaire design, pilot and mailing\nA steering group, comprising representatives of each of the\nfour participant categories listed above, designed the\nstudy and managed its implementation. The steering\ngroup agreed that the study needed to elicit from the four\ngroups of participants ((a) to (d) above): (i) perceptions\nof the role of the relevant organisations in delivering a\nrange of key health protection functions and; (ii) percep-\ntions of the confidence in safe delivery of these functions.\nIn order that the study could provide timely feedback for\npolicy makers it was agreed that a questionnaire using cat-\negorical responses would be used to elicit this informa-\ntion. Five responses were permitted for (i) above: \"PCT\nalone\"; \"led by PCT with HPA support\"; \"led by HPA with\nPCT support\"; \"HPA alone\" or \"other\", with an option for\nrespondents to clarify their response using free text. A four\npoint scale was used for (ii) above, with responses ranging\nfrom \"confident all the time\" to \"not confident\". The\nsteering group chose the health protection functions to\ninclude in the survey on the basis that they represented a\ndiverse range of activities that, together, represented a sub-\nstantial proportion of the health protection functions\nundertaken in England.\nThe questionnaire was piloted on a convenience sample\nof 13 individuals that included all four groups of partici-\npants listed above. The aim of the pilot was to highlight\nambiguous questions and unforeseen problems with the\nquestionnaire. The steering group considered the findings\nof the pilot, including the feedback of the pilot partici-\npants, and extra questions were inserted to reflect the fact\nthat some health protection responses (such as meningitis\ncontact tracing) might be different depending on whether\nthey were required during normal working hours or out-\nside of these hours.\nThe revised questionnaire was then sent by post to all par-\nticipants in the study. A second questionnaire was sent to\nnon-responders four weeks after the initial mailing.\nAnalysis\nQuestionnaire data were analysed using with STATA 9.0\n[20], using the individual responder (n = 264) as the unit\nof analysis. We defined a response as 'concordant' if a\nrespondent's views of who should and who does deliver a\nparticular health protection function described the same\nlead organisation. Subgroup analyses were undertaken\nwithin participant groups (a) to (d) in the responders who\nprovided their job title (n = 260).\nSee Additional File 1 for further details of the pilot data\nand approaches to data coding.\nResults\nQuestionnaires were sent to 374 individuals in the four\nparticipant groups. 264 were returned, an overall response\nrate of 70.6% (Figure 2).\nWho should be delivering particular health protection \nfunctions (Figure 3)?\nThere was variation in the expressed views of who should\nbe delivering a particular health protection function\namong individuals undertaking similar health protection\nrole. For example, of those individuals with a PCT role,\n17% stated that the health protection response to a single\ncase of meningitis should be led by the PCT, whereas 76%\nstated that it should be led by the HPA (Figure 3a, PCTPage 4 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2006, 6:297 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/6\/297roles, bars with dark shading). Furthermore, there was\nalso variation in expressed views of who should be deliv-\nering a particular health protection function between\ngroups of professionals undertaking different health pro-\ntection roles. For example, whilst only 17% of individuals\nwith a PCT role stated that the health protection response\nto a single case of meningitis should be led by the PCT,\n41% of individuals with an HPU role believed that this\nhealth protection response should be led by the PCT (Fig-\nure 3a, PCT and HPU roles, bars with dark shading). Var-\niation, both within and between different professional\nroles, in the expressed views of who should be delivering\nwas apparent across a diverse range of health protection\nfunctions (Figure 3). Although it is not straightforward to\nidentify a single unifying theme for these health protec-\ntion functions, many of these health protection duties\n(e.g. Figure 3a,d,e) form a substantial part of the overall\nhealth protection function at a local level.\nWho is delivering particular health protection functions \n(Figure 3)?\nWe also identified variation in views of who is delivering\na particular health protection function among individuals\nundertaking a similar health protection role. For example,\nof those individuals with a PCT role, 35% stated that the\nhealth protection response to a single case of meningitis\nwas led by the PCT, whereas 55% stated that it was led by\nthe HPA (Figure 3a, PCT role, bars with light shading). In\naddition, we found variation in views of who is delivering\na particular health protection function between groups of\nprofessionals undertaking different health protection\nroles. For example, 65% of individuals with an SHA role\nstated that the health protection response to a single case\nof meningitis was led by the PCT; in contrast, only 35% of\nindividuals with a PCT role expressed this view (Figure 3a,\nSHA role and PCT role, bars with light shading).\nIs there concordance between views of who should, and \nwho is, delivering health protection?\nThe concordance of respondents' views of who should\nand who is delivering each of the 18 health protection\nfunctions included in the survey is summarised in Table 1.\nNote that a response is defined as 'concordant' if a\nrespondent's views of who should and who does deliver a\nparticular health protection function described the same\nlead organisation.

Mean confidence levels\n(across all eighteen health protection functions) were\n79% in respondents with a PCT role; 76% in respondents\nwith an HPU role; only 68% in respondents with an SHA\nrole and; 73% in Regional Directors of the Health Protec-\ntion Agency. There was a strong correlation between the\nconcordance of respondents' views of who should and\nwho is delivering each of the 18 health protection func-\ntions and the confidence in the safe delivery of these func-\ntions (r = 0.65, P = 0.0038).\nHealth protection functions of concern\nWhilst there is no obvious threshold at which we should,\nusing our data, identify health protection functions that\nraise concern about the clarity and safety of their delivery,\nthere are a number of health protection functions with\nlow expressed concordance (\u226480%) and low expressed\nconfidence (\u226480%) (Tables 1 &2). These were: delivery of\nan MMR vaccination programme for university students\nin response to a large mumps outbreak; investigating an\napparent cluster of congenital anomalies attributed in\nmedia reports to a nearby landfill site; delivery of infec-\ntion control and reduction of healthcare acquired infec-\ntion in private sector nursing homes; monitoring rates of\nsexually transmitted infections; and immunisation train-\ning programs for primary care staff. These health protec-\ntion functions are either proactive, or permit a short\nperiod of planning before mounting a response (although\na rapid response to public concerns and media enquiries\nmay be needed). We highlight immunisation training\nprograms for primary care staff as an area where subopti-\nmal delivery of the training programs may have little or no\nmeasurable short-term impact on the success of immuni-\nsation programs; conversely, by the time it noticeably\nimpacts on the success of immunisation programs it may\ntake years to correct.\nConversely, some health protection functions which are\ninfrequently required, but for which a complex multi-\nagency response is immediately required (such as\nresponding to a factory fire with a potential release of\nharmful chemicals) had high levels of concordance (91%\nin normal hours; 86% outside normal hours) and rela-\ntively high levels of confidence (82% in normal hours;\n72% outside normal hours), especially considering that\nmost of the professionals surveyed would never have been\ncalled on to respond to such an incident.\nTable 1: Percentage of respondents with PCT, HPU, SHA and RDHPA roles expressing concordant* views of who should, and who \ndoes, deliver particular health protection functions.\nRespondent\nHealth protection function All PCT role HPU role SHA role RDHPA \u2020\nHandling of a single meningitis case during normal working hours 98 98 100 90 100\nHandling of a single meningitis case out of normal working hours 78 77 85 80 83\nEstablish\/ensure effective operation of outbreak control team for 3 linked meningococcal cases 94 93 100 91 100\nEstablish\/ensure effective operation of outbreak control team for 4 community legionnaires' cases. 92 89 100 100 100\nImproving uptake of MMR vaccine in under 2 year olds. 84 85 83 73 100\nImmunisation training programs for primary care staff 80 82 83 68 57\nMMR vaccination program for university students in response to a large mumps outbreak 76 75 86 68 86\nInfection control & reduction of healthcare acquired infections in primary care premises 86 87 83 86 71\nInfection control and reduction of healthcare acquired infections in private sector nursing homes 77 76 82 81 57\nInfection control & reduction of healthcare acquired infections in community hospitals 83 82 80 89 83\nDevelopment of a local strategy for improving sexual health 93 93 97 91 71\nMonitoring rates of sexually transmitted infections 79 77 87 86 100\nOrganisation of the rota for out of hours health protection arrangements 84 82 93 91 86\nFactory fire with release of harmful chemicals during normal working hours 92 93 90 86 86\nFactory fire with release of harmful chemicals out of normal working hours. 86 85 96 85 83\nManaging an outbreak of tuberculosis in a secondary school. 90 88 90 100 100\nInvestigating an apparent cluster of congenital anomalies attributed in media reports to a nearby \nlandfill site\n75 73 93 70 71\nManaging a look-back exercise in response to a surgeon carrying hepatitis C 90 90 83 95 100\n* We defined a response as 'concordant' if a respondent's views of who should and who does deliver a particular health protection function \ndescribed the same lead organisation.\n\u2020 Percentages in RDHPA column are based on only seven subjects and should therefore be interpreted with caution.Page 7 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2006, 6:297 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/6\/297Discussion\nMain findings of this study\nFor twelve of the eighteen health protection functions sur-\nveyed in this study, there is a high level of concordance\n(above 80%) in respondent's views as to which organisa-\ntion should be, and which organisation is, delivering the\nparticular functions. For these functions, the responsibil-\nity for health protection appears to be clearly understood.\nIndeed, the confidence expressed in the safe delivery of\nthese functions also tended to be high.\nHowever, five health protection functions had low levels\nof expressed concordance (\u226480%) and also low expressed\nconfidence (\u226480%) (see \"Health protection functions of con-\ncern\" above). It is tempting to attempt to find a unifying\ntheme for these functions, but perhaps all one can defini-\ntively conclude is that these represent a diverse range of\nhealth protection functions. One unifying theme, how-\never, is that these health protection functions do not\nrequire an immediate response to an emergency. In con-\ntrast, we found relatively high levels of concordance and\nconfidence in other health protection functions, many of\nwhich appear to require the specialist expertise of the HPA\nand some of which require an immediate response to an\nemergency situation.\nThis study therefore suggests that there are some areas of\nhealth protection where consistent understanding of\nresponsibility for delivery may be lacking. That is, people\nat the point of delivery may be unclear as to who is in\ncharge, and who is responsible for delivering the function.\nIt is possible that the changes in the organisational struc-\nture for health protection may have contributed to the\nlack of clarity for some health protection functions.\nWhat is already known on this topic\nReports into previous major health protection incidents\nhave indicated that clarity of responsibility and accounta-\nbility for delivering health protection functions is of\nutmost importance in safe and efficient response to health\nprotection incidents [1,3,12,13]. It is also recognised\ninternationally that systematised responses, with clear\nresponsibilities for health protection and other healthcare\nincidents, are required for responses to be effective. This\nincludes the control of infection [14,15], disaster plan-\nning [16,17] and patient safety [18]. The establishment of\nthe post of Consultant in Communicable Disease Con-\ntrol, following the \"Acheson report\" into the public health\nfunction in England [5], aimed to provide clear accounta-\nbility for this function, with overall responsibility taken\nby the Health Authority Director of Public Health.\nWhilst this system did give clarity of accountability, it also\nresulted in a dispersed and varied system of health protec-\ntion expertise across Health Authorities in England, with\nsome isolated practice and the potential for a lack of resil-\nience [1,7]. The Health Protection Agency was established\nto resolve this by bringing together health protection\nexpertise into a single agency [8]. This aimed to ensure\nthat a well co-ordinated response could be mounted to\nTable 2: Percentage of respondents expressing confidence * in the safe delivery of particular health protection functions amongst \nrespondents with PCT, HPU, SHA and RDHPA roles.\nRespondent\nHealth protection function All PCT role HPU role SHA role RDHPA \u2020\nHandling of a single meningitis case during normal working hours 97 97 100 91 100\nHandling of a single meningitis case out of normal working hours 91 90 96 89 100\nEstablish\/ensure effective operation of outbreak control team for 3 linked meningococcal cases 94 93 97 95 100\nEstablish\/ensure effective operation of outbreak control team for 4 community legionnaires' cases. 92 91 100 90 100\nImproving uptake of MMR vaccine in under 2 year olds. 74 77 67 59 71\nImmunisation training programs for primary care staff 75 79 70 55 43\nMMR vaccination programme for university students in response to a large mumps outbreak 75 77 69 68 57\nInfection control & reduction of healthcare acquired infections in primary care premises 67 72 55 41 67\nInfection control and reduction of healthcare acquired infections in private sector nursing homes 51 53 57 32 33\nInfection control & reduction of healthcare acquired infections in community hospitals 73 78 64 44 71\nDevelopment of a local strategy for improving sexual health 69 74 60 50 33\nMonitoring rates of sexually transmitted infections 60 61 67 50 43\nOrganisation of the rota for out of hours health protection arrangements 86 86 87 85 100\nFactory fire with release of harmful chemicals during normal working hours 82 83 77 82 86\nFactory fire with release of harmful chemicals out of normal working hours. 72 74 69 58 67\nManaging an outbreak of tuberculosis in a secondary school. 90 89 93 95 100\nInvestigating an apparent cluster of congenital anomalies attributed in media reports to a nearby \nlandfill site\n60 62 57 52 50\nManaging a look-back exercise in response to a surgeon carrying hepatitis C 83 80 92 90 100\n* the proportion of respondents stating that they were \"confident all of the time\" or \"confident most of the time\".\n\u2020 Percentages in RDHPA column are based on only seven subjects and should therefore be interpreted with caution.Page 8 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2006, 6:297 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/6\/297any health protection incident, with the ability to bring\nnational expertise in any field of health protection to bear\nquickly as required.\nThe development of this new system has, however, led to\na lack of certainty as to responsibilities for delivery of\nhealth protection functions at a local level, in particular\nbetween PCTs and Health Protection Units. Although the\nlegislative basis of accountabilities for health protection is\nbased on historical functions of previous organisations\nand functions of the HPA, there is still lack of certainty\nabout delivery of key activities [1].\nWhat this study adds\nSuccessful health protection arrangements require abso-\nlute clarity as to who is in charge and who delivers which\naspects of a health protection response in any particular\ncircumstance. This study shows that, whilst this is the case\nfor many aspects of health protection in England, for\nmany functions there are different perceptions as to the\norganisation that is responsible. Perceptions differ both\nwithin particular organisations (for example, within\nPCTs) and also between professional groups working in\ndifferent organisations. Associated with this lack of cer-\ntainty as to who is responsible, are lower levels of confi-\ndence in the safe delivery of these health protection\nfunctions. Our findings suggest that action needs to be\ntaken to improve the clarity of delivery of some health\nprotection functions. Perhaps a good starting place for\npolicy makers would be to examine the approaches (such\nas guidelines) that were previously employed to clarify\nresponsibility for those health protection functions where\nwe found high levels of concordance and confidence. This\nmay provide valuable guidance as to how to improve clar-\nity of responsibility consistently across all health protec-\ntion functions.\nLimitations of the study\nWe surveyed the self-reported perceptions of the partici-\npants, but we did not corroborate these reports with data\nfrom actual responses to specific health protection inci-\ndents. Clearly, whilst perceptions are important, they do\nnot necessarily reflect whether the actual response to\nhealth protection incidents is appropriate and safe. For\nexample, individuals working within PCTs and HPUs\ncould recognise that responsibilities are not always clear,\nand develop mechanisms to address this locally. The lack\nof clarity identified in this study does not therefore neces-\nsarily relate to lack of safe delivery in practice.\nOur survey included eighteen health protection functions,\nsome of which were closely related (for example, in work-\ning hours and out of working hours responses to a menin-\ngitis case). These eighteen functions do not encompass all\nhealth protection functions, nor are they a fully represent-\native sample of all health protection functions or of the\nworkload of any of the four different professional groups\nsurveyed (indeed this would be difficult to assess, since\nsome health protection incidents occur infrequently).\nRather, they were chosen by an expert steering committee\nto illustrate a broad range of scenarios where clarity of\nresponsibility and accountability is important. They\nreflect mainly reactive rather than proactive functions.\nTherefore, our report that five of eighteen functions\n(28%) lacked clarity of responsibility needs to be inter-\npreted with some caution \u2013 a higher or lower proportion\ncould have been obtained by a different choice of ques-\ntion. Furthermore, there is no obvious definition of an\nacceptable level of concordance or confidence in\nresponses to our survey. Whilst we have highlighted\nhealth protection functions with levels of expressed con-\ncordance and confidence \u226480%), any threshold we could\nhave chosen would have been subjective. We would,\ntherefore, advocate a qualitative rather than a quantitative\ninterpretation of our findings.\nCrucially, however, our survey did show important areas\nwhere improvements in clarity are required.\nOur survey was limited in the depth of information we\nobtained as it was based on categorical responses. The\nsteering group agreed that this was a necessary design fea-\nture for timely completion of the survey given impending\norganisational change in the National Health Service and\nHealth Protection Agency in England. Therefore, we uti-\nlised free text responses only to minimise misclassifica-\ntion of categorical responses. If time had allowed, we\nmight have supplemented our study with an in-depth\nqualitative study (for example, employing semi-structured\ninterviews) study to develop a thorough understanding of\nthe issues and to explore the reasons for particular\nexpressed views. Indeed, there may be an opportunity to\nfollow up our findings in this way.\nIt is possible that biases could have been introduced due\nto non-response or due to coding practices. We did not\nsurvey the non-respondents or collect detailed informa-\ntion on their characteristics. However, even in the extreme\nsituation that the characteristics of the responders and\nnon-responders were very different, the bias is very\nunlikely to have been of sufficient magnitude to materi-\nally alter our findings (response rate 70.6% overall; range\n67.7% \u2013 88.2% across the organisational groups). Coding\npractices are also unlikely to have introduced biases of sig-\nnificant magnitude. For example, we did not include\n\"don't know\" responses when estimating the proportion\nof participants who were confident \"all or some of the\ntime\" in the safe delivery of a health protection function.\nIf such responses actually reflected a lack of confidence\nthen we may have overestimated confidence levels. How-Page 9 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2006, 6:297 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/6\/297ever, only eight \"don't know\" responses were encountered\nover all questions and respondents (maximum of three\ndon't know responses per question), so the extent of any\nbias introduced is likely to be very small indeed. Again,\nour findings would not have been materially altered by\nour coding approach.\nFinally, whilst we surveyed professionals involved in\nhealth protection in England, we did not extend our study\nto other countries, where the organisational structure for\nhealth protection functions may differ. Our findings are\ntherefore unlikely to be directly generalisable to other\ncountries. However, clarity of accountability of health\nprotection functions is an important issue internationally\nand the lessons learned from effective implementation of\nhealth protection do have an international relevance.\nConclusion\nIn the context in which this study was undertaken, that is,\nrelated to health protection functions that require timely\nand complex interventions often involving many agencies\nand\/or components of the NHS, we would argue that clar-\nity of accountability is crucial. However, we found that\nthis clarity was lacking for several important health pro-\ntection functions. This study indicates that improvements\nin clarity of responsibility for health protection in Eng-\nland are required. The current re-organisation of PCT and\nStrategic Health Authority boundaries, alongside changes\ntaking place within the HPA to strengthen their frontline\nservices, provides an opportunity to address these issues.\nWith a move to a smaller number of larger PCTs and pos-\nsibly Health Protection Units, there is opportunity for\ngreater clarity of arrangements.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nPC conceived the study, chaired the steering group, coor-\ndinated the study and wrote the manuscript.
