We\nconclude the paper with a discussion on the viability of a recent assertion that collision\nbetween India and Asia could not have occurred prior to \u223c35 Ma.\nCitation: Najman, Y., et al.

Introduction\n[2] Precise determination of the timing and diachroneity\nof closure of Tethys and subsequent India\u2010Asia collision\nand Himalayan evolution, is critical to accurate calculation\nof crustal shortening, required for models of accommoda-\ntion of convergence. It is also important for the testing of\nhypotheses which link Himalayan orogenesis with global\ncooling [Raymo and Ruddiman, 1988] and changes in marine\ngeochemistry [Richter et al., 1992]. While the most com-\nmonly quoted age of collision lies between 55 and 50 Ma,\npublished ages span \u223c65 to 34 Ma, with this range explained\nto some extent by different definitions and indicators of\n\u201ccollision\u201d in an ongoing process. To quote but a few\nexamples, Jaeger et al. [1989] suggested a ca 65 Ma age\nof collision based on the appearance of Asian fauna in\nIndia at this time. Klootwijk et al. [1992] recorded a distinct\nreduction in the velocity of northward drift of the Indian\nplate at 55 Ma, based on palaeomagnetic evidence. This they\nattributed to final suturing between India and Asia, with\nearlier variations ascribed to initial India\u2010Asia contact as early\nas the Cretaceous\u2010Tertiary boundary. Dating of eclogites\nby de Sigoyer et al. [2000] can be interpreted as due to con-\ntinental subduction at ca 55 Ma, with continental collision\ninterpreted at ca 47 Ma from the decreased rate of their\nexhumation at this time. Aitchison et al. [2007] propose a\n\u223c34 Ma age for collision based on their plate reconstructions\nof the relative positions of India and Asia through time, as\nwell as additional lines of evidence (see section 5 for further\ndiscussion).\n[3] Cessation of marine facies and the first arrival of Asian\ndetritus on the Indian plate provide constraint to the mini-\nmum age of collision since seaways may persist on conti-\nnental crust after initial contact between two plates has taken\nplace, and there may be a considerable lag time between\ninitial contact and sufficient build up of topography to supply\n1Lancaster Environment Centre, University of Lancaster, Lancaster,\nUnited Kingdom.\n2Institut f\u00fcr Geowissenschaften Sigwartstrasse, University of\nTuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.\n3Department of Geological Sciences, UCL, London, United Kingdom.\n4Dipartimento di Scienze Geologiche e Geotecnologie, University of\nMilano\u2010Bicocca, Milan, Italy.\n5Department of Geological Sciences, Queen\u2019s University at Kingston,\nKingston, Ontario, Canada.\n6Department of Geology, CAS, Beijing, China.\n7School of Geography and Geosciences, University of St Andrews, St\nAndrews, United Kingdom.\n8NIGL, BGS Keyworth, Nottingham, United Kingdom.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2010JB007673\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, B12416, doi:10.1029\/2010JB007673, 2010\nB12416 1 of 18\ndetritus to the suture zone basin. The youngest preserved\nmarine facies documented in the western part of the orogen\n(India) are dated at 50.8 Ma in the suture zone and similar\nages are recorded to the south in the Tethyan Himalaya\n[Garzanti et al., 1987; Green et al., 2008]. First evidence\nof Asian detritus on the Indian plate, based on provenance\nof detrital zircon grains, is noted at 53\u201354 Ma in that region\n[Najman et al., 2010; D. Jenks et al., unpublished data, 2009].\nThis paper investigates the timing of cessation of marine\nfacies and the time of first arrival of Asian material on the\nIndian plate recorded in the Qumiba sedimentary section in\nthe eastern side of the orogen in Tibet. We combine it with a\ndiscussion of existing palaeomagnetic and geological data\nin order to further constrain the timing of India\u2010Asia colli-\nsion and evaluate a recent assertion that collision could not\nhave occurred prior to Oligocene times [Aitchison et al.,\n2007].\n2. Stratigraphic Background at the Qumiba\nSection, Tibet\n[4] The Qumiba section (Figures 1 and 2) lies south of the\nsuture zone which separates the Indian plate to the south from\nthe Asian plate to the north (Figure 2a). It records the final\nstages of sedimentation on the southern margin of Tethys. At\nthis section, Wang et al. [2002] used calcareous nannofossils\nto date the youngest marine horizon as late Eocene (late\nPriabonian, \u223c34 Ma), by far the youngest marine facies\nrecorded in the Himalaya. However, this age is disputed\n[Li et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2005, 2006],\nwith other workers using foraminifera to date the youngest\nmarine facies at this site at 50.6 Ma, coeval with the youngest\nmarine facies >1000 km along strike [Fuchs and Willems,\n1990; Garzanti et al., 1987; Green et al., 2008]. The inter-\npretations of subsequent workers who utilize these data are\nthus dependent on whether the age of Wang et al. is favored\nand thus, by comparison with equivalent data in the west of\nthe orogen, diachronous or later collision is invoked [e.g.,\nAitchison et al., 2007]; or whether the data of Zhu et al. [2005]\nare favored, in which case diachroneity of collision is refuted\n[e.g., Green et al., 2008]. The Qumiba section is thus a\ncontentious and pivotal succession to determining the time\nof India\u2010Asia collision.\n[5] Wang et al. [2002], Zhu [2003], and Zhu et al. [2005]\nagree that they have studied the same section, yet disagree\nover its location, with Wang et al. taking their coordinates\nfrom Chinese Military maps and Zhu et al. using a handheld\nGPS. Our coordinates for this section, N28\u00b041.376\u2032 E086\u00b0\n43.769\u2032, altitude 5030m, obtained from a Garmin 12 GPS set\nto Map Datum WGS84, concur with those of Zhu et al. Our\nfield photo (Figure S1) can be matched with that of Wang\net al. [2002, Figure 2] confirming that we have located the\nsame section as was previously studied.1\n[6] The area consists of the Zhepure Shan Formation\nTethyan limestones, overlain by \u223c100 m green mudstones,\nwith interbedded fine sandstones and rare limestones, in turn\noverlain by a similar thickness of red mudstones and infre-\nquent very fine grained sandstones. Wang et al. [2002] refer\nto the clastic succession as the Pengqu Formation, subdivided\ninto the Enba Member (lower green beds) and Zhaguo\nMember (upper red beds). Zhu et al. [2006] call the green\nbeds the Youxia Formation and the overlying red beds the\nShenkezar Formation (Figure 1). We use the original\nnomenclature, which was the published information at the\ntime our study was conducted. BothWang et al. and Zhu et al.\nconcur that the contact between the Zephure Shan Formation\nFigure 1.

(b and c) Geological map and cross section of the Qumiba section.\nLocations of all samples analyzed for biostratigraphy, illite crystallinity, petrography, zircon U\u2010Pb and\nfission track, and apatite fission track are shown.\nNAJMAN ET AL: TIMING OF INDIA\u2010ASIA COLLISION B12416B12416\n3 of 18\nand the Enba Member is conformable, and the contact\nbetween the Enba and Zhaguo members are disconformable.\nHowever, these researchers debate the temporal extent of the\ndisconformity between the Enba and Zhaguo members, and\ntheir age and facies interpretations.\n[7] Wang et al. [2002] consider the Pengqu Formation to\nbe entirely marine. They date the base of the Enba Member\nas Zone NP15 (Lutetian) and the uppermost Enba Member\nas Zones NP16\u201317 (Lutetian\u2010Bartonian). They consider\nthe overlying Zhagou Member to be of Zones NP18\u201320 age\n(Priabonian). They note a stratigraphically mixed assem-\nblage indicating significant reworking at the Enba\u2010Zhaguo\nboundary, and they consider the contact to be disconformable\nbut with no significant hiatus, based on their biostratigraphy.\nBy contrast, Zhu et al. [2005] consider the Enba Member to\nbe marine facies of Zone P8 (50.6 Ma). They consider the\noverlying Zhaguo Member to be continental, based on their\nobservations of facies and sedimentary structures. They\ntherefore consider the fauna recorded by Wang et al. in the\nZhaguo Member to be reworked. Zhu et al. reported a\n4.25m regolith and paleovertisol at the Enba\u2010Zhaguo contact\nwhich they consider to be further evidence of a discon-\nformable contact. Thus, in their view, the red beds of the\nZhaguo Member may be considerably younger than the\nEnba Member.\n[8] Based on our geological mapping, we interpret the\ncontacts between the Zephure Shan limestones and the\noverlying Enba Member, and between the Enba and over-\nlying Zhaguo members as depositional. Although the actual\nZephure Shan\u2010Enba and Enba\u2010Zhaguo contacts are not\nexposed (unlike Zhu et al. [2006], we did not trench to find\nthe Enba\u2010Zhaguo contact), the absence of any deformational\nfeatures (fracturing, faulting, pressure solution) and the near\u2010\nparallel nature of the beds of all three units indicate contacts\nare not structural. The minor dip differences between the\nZhepure Shan Formation and the Enba Member (<10\u00b0),\nand between the Enba Member and the Zhaguo Member\n(\u224811\u00b0) may indicate the presence of two subtle angular\nunconformities. The top of the Zhaguo Member is truncated\nby a reverse fault, with Enba Member carried southward in\nthe hanging wall. The clastic succession is truncated by\noverthrust Zephure Shan limestones (Figures 2b and 2c).\n3. Biostratigraphy of the Qumiba Section\n[9] We sampled from the Zephure Shan and Pengqu\nformations for biostratigraphic determination of age. All\nsamples used can be located in Figure 2, and from the\ngrid reference and altitude coordinates given in Table S1.\nForaminifera from three limestone samples, two from the\nZhepure Shan Formation and one from the Enba Member,\nwere identified from thin sections. Calcareous nannofossils\nfrom Enba and Zhaguo Member mudstones were analyzed\nusing simple smear slides and standard light microscope\ntechniques [Bown and Young, 1998]. Full analytical meth-\nodology is given in Text S1. Abundance and preservation\ncategories as well as a complete taxonomic list for forami-\nnifera and nannofossils are given in Text S2 and Figure S2.\n3.1. Age of the Zhepure Shan Formation\n[10] We carried out biostratigraphic analysis from thin\nsections of two limestone samples from the Zhepure Shan\nFormation. Samples TIN24 and TIN25 were packed with\nnummulitic larger benthic foraminifera. The assemblages\nwere randomly deposited and cemented with micrite. The\npresence of the larger benthic foraminifera Assilina leymeriei,\nDiscocyclina dispansa, Assilina sp., Nummulites atacicus,\nAssilina globosa and Discocyclina sp., illustrated in Figure 3,\nindicate an early Eocene age, (shallow benthic zone SBZ 8;\n\u223c53\u201354 Ma). Planktonic foraminifera were rare and mainly\nconsisted of Globigerina spp. However, the presence of\nPlanorotalites chapmani corroborates an age not younger than\nearly Ypresian (\u223c54.5\u201352.5; lowermost P7\/P6, Planktonic\nForaminifera Zone). The constant presence of planktonic\nforaminifera within the benthic assemblages indicates an\nopen marine fore\u2010reef environment. Our larger benthic fora-\nminifera data agree with the Ypresian age determination of\nZhu et al. [2005] but not with the younger Lutetian age of\nWang et al. [2002] (Figure 1).\n3.2. Age of the Enba and Zhaguo Members\n[11] We found no difference between the calcareous\nnannofossil assemblages preserved in the Enba and Zhaguo\nmembers and therefore consider them together. All samples\nhost stratigraphically mixed nannofossil assemblages, typi-\ncally with approximately 50% Late Cretaceous and 50%\nearly Paleogene components. Identifying discrete assem-\nblage ages within this mix is problematic, however, there do\nappear to be coherent Cenomanian (Corollithion kennedyi,\nAxopodorhabdus albianus, Helenea chiastia, Rhagodiscus\nachlyostaurion), Campanian (Uniplanarius trifidus),\nMaastrichtian (Micula murus), mid\u2010Paleocene (Fasciculithus\npileatus, F. ullii, F. bitectus), and Paleocene\/Eocene bound-\nary interval (Calciosolenia aperta, Discoaster multiradiatus,\nFasciculithus involutus) elements. The dominant nanno-\nfossils are consistently Coccolithus pelagicus (Cenozoic),\nToweius pertusus (Paleocene\u2013lower Eocene) and Watz-\nnaueria barnesiae (Mesozoic). The youngest assemblage\ncomponents, which may represent the depositional age of\nthese sediments, are always rare but nevertheless age diag-\nnostic, and comprise spinose sphenoliths (Sphenolithus\nconspicuus, S. radians, S. villae), Tribrachiatus orthostylus\nand Discoaster kuepperi. These species are compatible\nwith an age corresponding to nannofossil Zones NP11\u201312\n(Ypresian, 50.6\u201353.5 Ma) (see, for example, stratigraphic\nranges documented by Perch\u2010Nielsen [1985] and Bralower\nand Mutterlose [1995]). The minimum age of NP12 (50.6\u2013\n52.8 Ma) is supported by the absence of reticulofenestrids\n(i.e., Reticulofenestra, Dictyococcites and Cyclicargolithus),\nwhich became the dominant Paleogene coccoliths after\ntheir appearance in this zone, and strongly indicates that there\nare no younger nannofossils in these sediments. Selected\nnannofossils are illustrated in Figure 4.\n[12] We also analyzed one sample (TG04\u201332D; several\nthin sections) from the EnbaMember which yielded abundant\nplanktonic foraminifers that indicate a similar stratigraphic\nage to the nannofossils. Again these assemblages have\nstratigraphically mixed elements, including reworked Late\nCretaceous and Paleocene forms occurring in micritic or\nsparitic clasts appearing as patches in the matrix, together\nwith early Eocene forms which we do not consider to\nbe reworked considering their in situ occurrence in the\nsparitic matrix. The youngest age\u2010diagnostic foraminifera\nare morozovellids (e.g.,Morozovella aragonensis, M. quetra,\nNAJMAN ET AL: TIMING OF INDIA\u2010ASIA COLLISION B12416B12416\n4 of 18\nM. formosa, M. lensiformis) and acarininids, Globigerina\nspp., and Globeriginatheka sp.). The co\u2010occurrence of these\ntaxa indicates foraminiferal zones P7\u20138 (ca. 50.4\u201352.3 Ma).\nThis is a stratigraphic match with our nannofossil zone\nassignment and comparable to the planktonic foraminifera\npreviously reported from the Enba Member by Zhu et al.\n[2005]. Fauna are illustrated in Figure 4.\n3.3. Comparison With Data Along Strike\n[13] There is little precise age dating of the youngest marine\nfacies of sections in the near vicinity to the Qumiba section.

Since no age\u2010\ndiagnostic fossils are found in the Zongpubei Formation,\nWillems and Zhang [1993a] assigned an early Eocene age to\nthe formation, based solely on its stratigraphic position above\nthe Zongpu Formation. In the Gongza section near Tingri\n(Figures 1 and 2a), Willems and Zhang [1993b] and Willems\net al. [1996] record green marls and overlying continental red\nbeds in faulted contact with the underlying passive margin\nlimestones of the Zephure Shan Formation, which they\nbiostratigraphically dated as extending to Lutetian (but note\nthat Blondeau et al. [1986] date the formation as extending\nonly to early Eocene). Based on similar stratigraphy and\nfacies, Willems and Zhang correlate the overlying marls and\nred beds with the Zongpubei Formation at Gamba. They\nassign them a Lutetian or younger age based on (1) the\n(disputed) [Blondeau et al., 1986] age of the Zhephure Shan\nFormation in faulted contact below and (2) the (disputed)\n[Zhu et al., 2005] correlation with the facies at Gamba, which\nare also unfossiliferous and dated only by their stratigraphic\nposition above the passive margin limestones.\n[14] Further along strike in India, final recorded marine\nsedimentation is more precisely dated. The Nummulitic\nlimestones represent the youngest preserved marine sedi-\nmentary rocks documented in the suture zone and the Kong\nFormation represents the youngest marine sedimentary rocks\npreserved to the south in the Tethys Himalaya (Figure 1). At\nno location has marine sedimentation been dated any younger\nthan 50.5 Ma [Critelli and Garzanti, 1994; Fuchs and\nWillems, 1990; Green et al., 2008; Henderson et al., 2010;\nNajman et al., 2010; Nicora et al., 1987;] comparable with\nour data from the Qumiba section in Tibet.\n4. Provenance of the Rocks of the Qumiba\nSection, Tibet\n[15] When the Tethys Ocean closed, the Palaeozoic\u2013\nearliest Cenozoic Tethyan sediments of the northern Indian\npassive continental margin collided with the Andean\u2010type\nsouthern active margin of Asia, represented by theMesozoic\u2010\nPaleogene batholiths of the Trans\u2010Himalaya, along what\nis now termed the Indus\/Yarlung\u2010Tsangpo suture zone\n(Figure 2a). Thus, the arrival of Asian continental arc\u2010derived\ndetritus onto the Indian plate provides a minimum time of\ncollision. The provenance study below discriminates between\nIndian versus Asian plate detritus in the Pengqu Formation\nusing (1) petrography to identify metamorphic and sedi-\nmentary detritus of the Indian plate versus igneous detritus\nof the Asian plate and (2) zircon mineral dating, since grains\nof earliest Tertiary\u2010Mesozoic U\u2010Pb age are diagnostic of\nderivation from the Asian plate, as discussed further in the\nfollowing sections.\n4.1. Petrography: Methods and Results\n[16] The six analyzed samples are very fine grained sand-\nstones (average median diameter 3.7 \u00b1 0.3 \u0001; grain size\ndetermined by visual comparison and direct measurement in\nthin section). Replacement by authigenic carbonate occurs\nin all samples (9 \u00b1 4% of the rock), as well as interstitial\nphyllosilicate grown during diagenesis (5 \u00b1 3% of the rock).\nIn each sample, 400 points were counted by the Gazzi\u2010\nDickinson method [Dickinson, 1985]. Traditional ternary\nparameters and plots (QFL, LmLvLs) [Ingersoll et al., 1993]\nwere supplemented, specifically where lithic grains are con-\ncerned, by an extended spectrum of key indices [Garzanti and\nVezzoli, 2003]. Results are illustrated in Figure 5 and tabu-\nlated in Table S2.\n[17] Detrital modes of Enba and Zhaguo sandstones do\nnot showmarked differences, and consequently are discussed\njointly. Composition is quartzofeldspathic, but with sig-\nnificant felsitic and microlitic volcanic rock fragments, and\nsubordinate sedimentary (sparite, micrite, shale, chert) and\nmetamorphic (shale, phyllite, quartz\u2010mica, chloritoschist,\npossibly rare serpentinite) grains. Volcanic detritus is more\nfelsic in Zhaguo sandstones, where monocrystalline quartz\nand nonvolcanic lithic grains tend to increase slightly with\nFigure 5. Petrography of the Enba and Zhaguo members.\nQFL plot, apices: Q, quartz; F, feldspar; L, lithics. Fields,\nafter Dickinson [1985]: RO, recycled orogen; CB, continen-\ntal block; MA, magmatic arc.

A very poor heavy\u2010mineral\nassemblage, strongly affected by diagenetic dissolution,\nconsists exclusively of ultrastable species (zircon, tour-\nmaline, rare rutile and chrome spinel) with no amphibole\nor pyroxene. Micas are rare. Reworked specimens of\nGlobotruncana are frequently observed.\n[18] Bulk petrography (Q 69 \u00b1 4, F 18 \u00b1 5 Lv 8 \u00b1 2 Ls 2 \u00b1 1\nLm 3 \u00b1 1; P\/F 58 \u00b1 7), in particular the notable proportion of\nvolcanic lithics and plagioclase, indicates significant contri-\nbution from a magmatic arc. However, the composition has a\nmuchmore quartzose mode than found in modern arc settings\n[Garzanti et al., 2007; Marsaglia and Ingersoll, 1992]. Sig-\nnificant dilution by detritus derived from a quartzose sedi-\nmentary source is thus indicated, with dissolution of unstable\ngrains in the wet subequatorial climate (as evidenced from\npalaeomagnetic data (section 5.1) and presence of kaolinite\n(section 4.2.1)) also likely to have influenced the resulting\nmode. The Enba and Zhaguo sandstones therefore display\nmixed provenance. Quantitative provenance analysis carried\nout by end\u2010member calculations using a linear mixing model\n[Weltje, 1997] indicate provenance from the volcanic cover\n(at least 10\u201315% of the total detritus, including volcanic rock\nfragments and fragments of plagioclase grains) and batho-\nlithic plutonic roots of a partly dissected magmatic arc (at\nleast 20\u201325% of total detritus, including much plagioclase\nand K\u2010feldspar), with the remainder derived from recycling\nof a sedimentary succession including quartzose sandstones.\n[19] Our data are broadly consistent with previous petro-\ngraphic work by Zhu et al. [2005]. The much greater pro-\nportion of micrite\/sparite grains and interstitial matrix\nreported by Zhu et al. may be ascribed to different criteria in\nevaluating diagenetic replacements and interstitial phyllosi-\nlicate growth at the expense of framework grains in very fine\ngrained sandstone samples.\n4.2. Mineral Dating: Methods and Results\n4.2.1. Burial Temperatures Determined From Clay\nMineralogy and Illite Crystallinity Data\n[20] In order to determine if the mineral ages reflect the\ntiming of cooling in the source region, or the time of post-\ndepositional resetting if minerals have been subjected to\ntemperatures above their closure temperature subsequent to\nburial, the degree of postdepositional heating that the host\nrock has been subjected to needs to be determined. The\nthickness of illite crystals is dependent on metamorphic grade\n[Weber, 1972]. Thus, XRD analyses on the <2m (diagenetic)\nfraction of rocks, to determine illite crystallinity as well as\nclay mineralogy (which is also diagnostic of metamorphic\ngrade), enable postdepositional burial temperatures of the\nrocks to be determined. Eighteen Enba Member mudstones\/\nsiltstones and 25 Zhaguo Member samples were analyzed.\nAnalytical methodology is given in Text S1.\n[21] All samples containedmixed layer illite\u2010smectite clays\nand chlorite. Additionally, the Enba Member contained\nkaolinite. This clay mineralogy is distinctive of the diagenetic\nzone of burial. Hbrel values are >700 for the ZhaguoMember,\nand >600 for the Enba Member (with one sample at 391),\nindicating diagenetic facies (<200\u00b0C) which has Hbrel values\n>278 [Blenkinsop, 1988]. Since the partial annealing zone for\nfission tracks in zircon lies between \u223c200\u2013320\u00b0C [Tagami\net al., 1998], we consider that our zircon fission track ages,\ngiven below, represent the timing of cooling and exhumation\nin the source region. The U\u2010Pb isotopic system in zircons\nis unperturbed by temperatures commensurate with sedi-\nmentary rocks. All data are given in Table S3.\n4.2.2. Dating of Detrital Zircons by U\u2010Pb and Fission\nTrack Techniques\n[22] Four samples, two from the Enba Member and two\nfrom the Zhaguo Member, were counted for zircon fission\ntrack analysis. Two samples, one from the Zhaguo Member\nand one from the Enba Member were chosen for U\u2010Pb dating\nof zircons, and one sample was chosen for double dating of\nthe grains by both techniques. Full analytical methodologies\nare given in Text S1.\n[23] In both the Enba and Zhaguo members, the majority of\ngrains have U\u2010Pb ages between Cretaceous\u2013earliest Eocene\n(140\u201355 Ma) with uncommon grains > 500 Ma (Figure 6\nand Table S4). Zircon fission track ages are also domi-\nnantly Cretaceous\u2010earliest Eocene, with older ages spanning\nback through the Mesozoic (Figure 7 and Table S5). The\nmajority of grains analyzed by both techniques have similar\nU\u2010Pb and zircon fission track (ZFT) ages, illustrated by their\nposition close to the 1:1 line on the U\u2010Pb versus ZFT plot\n(Figure 8 and Table S6). These are interpreted as formation\nages from an igneous source. The grains with Precambrian U\u2010\nPb ages were exhumed from depth during the Mesozoic.\n[24] We also carried out apatite fission track dating on three\nsamples (see Table S5 for data and brief discussion). Since\napatite has a relatively low partial annealing zone, these\ndata do not contribute to provenance determination since the\nages do not unequivocally represent the timing of cooling\nin the source area rather than the time of postdepositional\ncooling following diagensis in the basin.\n4.3.

Asian plate\ndata represent analyses from the southern Gangdese batholiths, excluding data from the northern range as defined byWen et al.\n[2008], since the southern slopes are the most likely source region to the suture zone. Data are therefore compiled from Wen\net al. [2008] and references therein [Booth et al., 2004; Harrison et al., 2000; McDermid et al., 2002; Miller et al., 1999; Mo\net al., 2005;Quidelleur et al., 1997; Scharer et al., 1984]. Indian plate data are taken from the compilation published inGehrels\net al. [2008]. The population of zircons aged 200\u2013400 Ma discovered by Aikman et al. [2008] is not included in this synthesis\ndue to uncertainty over the terrane assignment of their host rock [see Aikman et al., 2008, and references therein], and their\nomission does not change our interpretation. Grains >1700 Ma were not found in the Enba or Zhaguo members and are\nexcluded from the Indian and Asian plate plots.\nNAJMAN ET AL: TIMING OF INDIA\u2010ASIA COLLISION B12416B12416\n8 of 18\nFigure 6\nNAJMAN ET AL: TIMING OF INDIA\u2010ASIA COLLISION B12416B12416\n9 of 18\nern source from the Asian plate needs to be considered\n(Figure 2a). As summarized above, the southern margin of\nthe Asian plate consists of a Mesozoic\u2010Paleogene Andean\u2010\nstyle batholith of the Trans\u2010Himalayan continental arc\nintruded through Precambrian basement and overlying\nPhanerozoic sedimentary rocks of the Asian plate Lhasa\nBlock. The northern margin of the Indian plate consists of\nPaleozoic\u2010Cretaceous passive margin sedimentary rocks of\nthe Tethyan Himalaya, with rocks of the Higher Himalaya,\nmetamorphosed to medium\u2010high grade during the Tertiary\nHimalayan orogeny, located to the south [Hodges, 2000, and\nreferences therein].\n[26] Our petrographic, U\u2010Pb and fission track (FT) zircon\ndata provide evidence for a consistent interpretation of\nprovenance. By comparison of U\u2010Pb ages of zircons from\nthe Enba and Zhaguo members with zircons from the Trans\u2010\nHimalayan arc and Tethyan Himalaya (Figure 6) it can be\nseen that the majority of Enba and Zhaguo Member grains\n(dated Cretaceous\u2013earliest Eocene) are sourced from the\nAsian plate, where the Trans\u2010Himalayan batholith provides a\nsource with abundant zircons spanning this age range, in\ncontrast to the Indian plate where such grains are uncommon\n(Figure 6, bottom two rows). Although there is a peak of Early\nCretaceous ages recorded from the Wolong volcaniclastics\nof the Indian plate [Hu et al., 2009a] (Figure 6) which could\nconceivably have contributed some grains to the sediments\nof the Pengqu Formation, we do not consider them a viable\nalternative source to the Trans\u2010Himalaya since (1) the dom-\ninant age population in the Pengqu Formation is younger\nthan the restricted range of the Wolong volcaniclastics, and\n(2) Cretaceous grains make up between 3 and 28% of zircons\nin the Wolong volcaniclastics, the rest of the grains being of\nCambro\u2010Ordovician and older age. Given this low proportion\nof Cretaceous\u2010aged grains in the unit, and the relatively\nrestricted exposure of this unit compared to the Precambrian\u2010\naged zircon bearing Tethyan Himalaya as a whole, it\nseems highly improbable that the dominant population of\nPalaeogene\u2010Cretaceous grains in the Pengqu Formation\ncould be sourced from this unit.\n[27] Fission track data show that these grains have\nCretaceous\u2010Paleocene zircon fission track ages, with indi-\nvidual grain ages similar to the grain\u2019s U\u2010Pb age, typical of\ngrains of igneous origin (Figure 8). Fission track ages from all\nsamples are exclusively Mesozoic and younger (Figure 7).\nThis is consistent with an Asian source, but inconsistent\nwith Indian derivation, since Paleozoic grains make up a\nsignificant proportion of the population eroded from the\nIndian plate during the Eocene [Jain et al., 2009; Najman\net al., 2005].\n[28] The grains with U\u2010Pb ages >500 Ma may be recycled\nfrom sedimentary rocks of either the Indian plate or the\nAsian plate Lhasa Block, both of which contain zircons of\nPrecambrian age [e.g., Chu et al., 2006; Gehrels et al., 2008;\nLeier et al., 2007]. We speculate that the Lhasa Block could\nbe the more likely source for these grains in view of these\ngrains\u2019 Mesozoic zircon fission track ages (Figure 7). While\nthe Lhasa Block was undergoing crustal thickening and\nexhumation subsequent to collision with the Qiangtang ter-\nrain to the north during the Late Jurassic\u2013Early Cretaceous\n[Kapp et al., 2005], thrusting began only later on the Indian\nplate margin; not before the latest Cretaceous at the earliest\n[Searle et al., 1988]. A mixed arc and recycled sedimentary\nFigure 7. Radial plots of zircon fission track (FT) data\nshowing the principal age modes extracted using the method\nof Galbraith and Green [1990]. The size of each data set is\nlower than desirable due to the relative sparsity of zircon\ngrains suitable for FT analysis.\nNAJMAN ET AL: TIMING OF INDIA\u2010ASIA COLLISION B12416B12416\n10 of 18\nsource is consistent with our petrographic data (section 4.1)\nwhich shows derivation in part from volcanic covers and\nbatholithic roots of a partly dissected magmatic arc and in\npart from recycling of a sedimentary succession including\nquartzose sandstones.\n[29] Our data thus show evidence that Asian detritus was\ndeposited on the Indian plate by 50 Ma thereby providing\na minimum constraint to the time of collision. Mesozoic\nzircons are found in sediments dated at 55 Ma in the Zheba\nsection in Tibet [Ding et al., 2005], in line with the more\nnortherly position of this section compared to the Qumiba\nlocality, thereby providing further constraint to the time of\nIndia\u2010Asia collision. Our provenance interpretation is not at\nvariance with that of previous workers [Wang et al., 2002;\nZhu et al., 2005] who considered that these Tertiary rocks of\nthe Pengqu Formation show first evidence of erosion from\nsuture zone ophiolites and continental arc rocks of the Asian\nmargin based on the presence of volcanic lithic fragments\nand euhedral feldspars in the sandstones, composition of\nCr\u2010spinel, and sandstone and shale geochemistry, in addition\nto south directed palaeocurrent indicators. However, more\nrecently, Aitchison et al. [2007] proposed that the detritus\nwith such a signature was derived from an intraoceanic arc\nand ophiolite sequence, the combined Dazhuqu\u2010Baingang\u2010\nZedong terrains, sandwiched between the Indian and Asian\nplate. More isotopic data need to be collected from this arc\nbefore a robust comparison of signatures between this arc\nand Enba and Zhaguo formation detritus can be made, and it\nis certainly correct that some types of detritus, for example\nCr\u2010Spinel, could be consistent with such a source. However,\nat present, we consider the source, at least of the zircons with\nCretaceous\u2013earliest Eocene U\u2010Pb ages, which comprise 72%\nof the detrital zircon population, to be more likely derived\nfrom the Trans\u2010Himalayan batholith of the Asian plate, rather\nthan the Dazhuqu\u2010Baingang\u2010Zedong intraoceanic arc and\nophiolite, because U\u2010Pb ages of zircons that have been dated\nfrom the intraoceanic arc indicate that it is late Jurassic or\nolder [McDermid et al., 2002]. Zircons of such age in the\nEnba and Zhaguo members are extremely rare, and while we\nacknowledge that our data set is small, the result of the time\nconsuming nature of the double\u2010dating technique, our data\nare similar to a much more comprehensive data set from the\nsame rocks analyzed by Hu et al. [2009b]. Instead, zircons\nfrom the Enba and Zhaguo members are Cretaceous\u2010earliest\nEocene age, which is in agreement with the range of ages\ndocumented from bedrock data of the Trans\u2010Himalayan\nbatholith (Figure 6). The dominant population in the Enba\nand Zhaguo Formation is aged between \u223c85\u2013105 Ma and\nmirrors a peak of ages between 110 and 80Ma documented in\nthe Trans\u2010Himalayan batholith [Ji et al., 2009; Wen et al.,\n2008]. The lack of a clearly defined peak at \u223c50 Ma in the\nEnba and Zhaguo formations, which can be clearly seen in the\nbatholiths signature (Figure 6) is explained when the depo-\nsitional age of the sedimentary rocks is taken into account.\nFigure 8. U\u2010Pb versus zircon fission track (ZFT) ages for double dated zircon grains in sample TG04\u20132A\nZhaguo Member. Both U\u2010Pb and ZFT ages were quoted at 2 sigma errors. Dashed line shows the 1:1 cor-\nrelation where ZFT age = U\u2010Pb age. One grain has an apparent ZFT age that is older than its U\u2010Pb age. We\nattribute this either to bad counting or to misidentification of the correct ZFT\u2010dated grain for U\u2010Pb dating in\nthe crowded mount.\nNAJMAN ET AL: TIMING OF INDIA\u2010ASIA COLLISION B12416B12416\n11 of 18\nIt should also be noted that if metamorphic ages (70\u201390 Ma)\nof amphibolites and blueschists within serpentinite\u2010matrix\nmelanges along the southern margin of the intraoceanic arc\u2013\nophiolite complex are interpreted as the time of the arc\u2010\nophiolite\u2019s obduction on to the Indian margin [Aitchison\net al., 2000] rather than subduction of a spreading center\n[Aitchison et al., 2003], then the ages of the zircons recorded\nin the Enba and Zhaguo members extend younger than the\ntime of proposed obduction onto the Indian plate.\n5. Discussion: Do Existing Geological and\nPalaeomagnetic Constraints \u201cDemand\u201d India\u2010Asia\nCollision Occurred \u201cNo Earlier Than the\nOligocene\u201d?\n[30] Our provenance data from the Qumiba sedimentary\nsuccession provide evidence of collision by 50 Ma, deter-\nmined from the first arrival of Asian material on the Indian\nplate at this location. However, Aitchison et al. [2007] attri-\nbute this detritus to erosion not from Asia, but from an\nintraoceanic arc and ophiolite (the Dazhuku, Bainang and\nZedong terrains), a provenance interpretation that we do not\nfavor, as discussed above. Aitchison et al. propose that it is\nthis intraoceanic arc\u2010India collision which occurred around\n\u223c55 Ma, and they consider that \u201c\u2026.as the geological record\nand constraints on the relative positions of India and Asia\ndemand, the continental collision occurred no earlier than the\nOligocene\u2026..\u201d Their lines of evidence are as follows.\n[31] (1) Their determination of the relative positions of\nIndia and Asia during the early Cenozoic require that colli-\nsion occurred at <35 Ma and the two continents were too far\napart to have collided at 55 Ma.\n[32] (2) They consider that the geological record shows that\ncessation of marine facies, the beginning of continental\nmolasse sedimentation along the suture zone, onset of major\nregional sedimentation, cessation of continental subduction\nalong the southern margin of Eurasia, and initiation of major\ncollision\u2010related thrusting occurred later than previously\nbelieved. We discuss these lines of evidence below.\n5.1. Position of the Indian and Asian Plates During\nthe Cretaceous\u2013Earliest Cenozoic as Determined\nFrom Palaeomagnetic Data\n[33] In Figure 9 we present a reconstruction of the paleo-\ngeographic configuration between 58.5 to 45 Ma based on\navailable paleomagnetic data (Table 1). The southern margin\nof Eurasia (shaded area) is determined for a reference point at\nthe Indus\u2010Yarlung suture zone (IYSZ) (29\u00b0N\/90\u00b0E) selected\nat a best mean longitude close to the sampling areas of the\npaleomagnetic data involved. The results in Figure 9 com-\nprise new data from the Paleocene\u2010Eocene Linzizong vol-\ncanic rocks in the Linzhou (mainly) and Namling basins and\nthe Mendui area on the Lhasa Block. According to the\nnomenclature ofDong et al. [2005] three different formations\ncan be distinguished; the paleolatitudes derived for these\nformations are shown in Figure 9 by blue lines. Only results\nfrom volcanic rocks are considered here. Paleolatitudes for\nthe reference point yield 6.7\u00b0N for the Dianzhong Formation\n(Fm) (Linzhou and Namling [Chen et al., 2010]), 11.6\u00b0N for\nthe Nianbo Fm (Linzhou and Mendui [Chen et al., 2010; Sun\net al., 2010]), 13.2\u00b0N for dykes intruded into the Nianbo Fm\n[Liebke et al., 2010], and 16.8\u00b0N for the Pana Fm (Linzhou\nBasin [Chen et al., 2010; Dupont\u2010Nivet et al., 2010; Tan\net al., 2010]). The red line in Figure 9 denotes the average\nof these four formations (\u223c12\u00b0N). Looking closely at the new\ndata from the Pana Formation, a high discrepancy in paleo-\nlatitudes from this formation becomes evident (short green\nlines in Figure 9) diverging largely from 5.2\u00b0N [Chen et al.,\n2010] to 32.7\u00b0N [Tan et al., 2010].\n[34] The work of Achache et al. [1984] and Westphal et al.\n[1983] already yielded similar paleolatitudes of \u223c13\u00b0N and\n\u223c8\u00b0N, respectively, however, the Achache et al. data were put\ninto question because of a possible secondary overprint and\nthe significance of the Westphal et al. results is limited\nbecause only two sites were sampled. Data from the intru-\nsives, ophiolites and flysch in the suture zone are also avail-\nable, but it is not clear whether these rocks weremagnetized at\nthe position where the continents collided. Nevertheless, it is\nworth noting that the inclinations from these units give\npaleolatitudes of 7\u201310\u00b0N [Klootwijk et al., 1979], 10\u201320\u00b0N\n[Pozzi et al., 1984] and 3\u00b0S\u20138\u00b0N [Abrajevitch et al., 2005].\nWe also do not consider results from the granites directly\nadjacent to the IYSZ as this zone is strongly affected by large\nvertical\u2010axis rotations and also inclinations scatter consider-\nably [Otofuji et al., 1989]. For the Cretaceous there are sev-\neral data which can be considered as meaningful. Most of\nthem stem from the mid\u2010Cretaceous sedimentary Shexing\nFormation (mostly red beds) indicating paleolatitudes (for the\nreference point) of \u223c7\u00b0N [Lin and Watts, 1988], \u223c11\u00b0N\n[Achache et al., 1984], \u223c21\u00b0N [Westphal et al., 1983], and\n\u223c12\u00b0N [Tan et al., 2010]. Possible inclination shallowing is a\ncritical issue for the validity of data from sedimentary rocks.\nTan et al. [2010] correct their data by the E\/I analysis [Tauxe\nand Kent, 2004] and calculate a corrected paleolatitude of\n\u223c22\u00b0N, however, although the test can be useful to identify\nthe existence of inclination shallowing one should be careful\nwith interpreting corrected results quantitatively. Further\nCretaceous data are available from the Nagqu and Qelico\nvolcanics yielding paleolatitudes of \u223c17\u00b0N and \u223c18\u00b0N,\nrespectively [Lin and Watts, 1988], and from volcanics\nintercalated with sediments [Tan et al., 2010] which give a\nsomewhat more northerly position at \u223c23\u00b0N. The Cretaceous\nand Cenozoic paleolatitudes coincide relatively well and\nsuggest that the southern margin of Eurasia (Lhasa Block)\nwas at an approximately constant latitude from Upper Cre-\ntaceous until the onset of the collision with India. A further\nstatistically sound result from Cretaceous limestones in the\nfar west of the Lhasa Block [Chen et al., 1993] gives a similar\npaleolatitude of \u223c11\u00b0N (corresponding to \u223c8\u00b0N for the ref-\nerence point) indicating that the southern Eurasian margin\nwas quite linear prior to collision. We are therefore confident\nthat the paleogeographic position shown in Figure 9 (red bold\nline and shaded area) is a good estimate for the precollisional\nsouthern margin of the Lhasa Block. It implies \u223c1950 km\nnorth\u2010south shortening within the Tibetan Plateau by intra-\ncontinental deformation.\n[35] The position of the northern margin of India around\nthe time of the collision in Figure 9 is determined by the\nresults of Patzelt et al. [1996] for the 58.5 Ma Zongpu\nFormation at Gamba and Duela (Table 1). A large extent\nof \u201cGreater India\u201d can be concluded from these data. The\nnorthward drift from 58.5 to 45Ma follows the apparent polar\nwander path (APWP) of Besse and Courtillot [2002, 2003].\nAnother 14 sites from theMaastrichtian Zongshan Formation\nNAJMAN ET AL: TIMING OF INDIA\u2010ASIA COLLISION B12416B12416\n12 of 18\nstudied by Patzelt et al. [1996] confirm the results from the\nZongpu Formation. Besse et al. [1984] derived a much\nsmaller extent of \u201cGreater India\u201d from the Zhepure Shan\nFormation at Tingri, however based on five sites only.\nRecently published data for the Zongpu Formation at Tingri\n[Tong et al., 2008] reside on three sites only and were\ndetermined by great circle intersections; they have to be\nconsidered as very preliminary at this stage. Some available\ndata from older Cretaceous rock units [Appel et al., 1998;\nKlootwijk and Bingham, 1980] are based on only one or two\nsampling sites and pre\u2010Cretaceous data are unsuitable to\ndetermine the extent of the northern margin due to strong\ncounterclockwise rotation of India.\n[36] In summary, Figure 9 and the data presented above\ndemonstrate that both continental margins achieved their\ninitial contact in early Eocene. Liebke et al. [2010] determine\nFigure 9. Paleogeographic reconstruction of the position of India during 58.5 to 45 Ma and the southern\nmargin of Eurasia around 50 Ma (shaded area). The dot at the northern margin of \u201cGreater India\u201d corre-\nsponds to the paleolatitude of Patzelt et al. [1996] that is determined for the Zongpu group with an age\nof 58.5 Ma. The drift rate of India is according to the apparent polar wander path of Besse and Courtillot\n[2002]. New paleomagnetic results from four different units of the Linzizong Formation are considered\nfor the determination of the precollisional or syncollisional southern margin of Eurasia (blue lines): 1, Pana\nFormation (Fm) (mean value of data from Dupont\u2010Nivet et al. [2010], Tan et al. [2010], and Chen et al.\n[2010]); 2, dykes intruded in the Nianbo Fm [Liebke et al., 2010]; 3, Nianbo Fm (mean value of data\nfrom Chen et al. [2010] and Sun et al. [2010]); 4, Dianzhong Fm [Chen et al., 2010]. The red line displays\nthe mean value of all four formations. Green lines show the different results from the Pana Fm (5, Tan et al.\n[2010]; 6, Dupont\u2010Nivet et al. [2010]; 7, Chen et al. [2010] for the Linzhou Basin; 8, Chen et al. [2010] for\nthe Namling Basin). All paleomagnetic data are listed in Table 1. Latitude lines are in 20\u00b0 increments up to\n80\u00b0N.\nNAJMAN ET AL: TIMING OF INDIA\u2010ASIA COLLISION B12416B12416\n13 of 18\nthe age of collision at 53\u201349 Ma at 90\u00b0E; Dupont\u2010Nivet et al.\n[2010] derive a slightly younger age of 48 Ma (57\u201340 Ma\nwithin 95% confidence limits) and Chen et al. [2010] cal-\nculate a collisional time of 65\u201350 Ma (or narrowed down to\n60\u201355 Ma assuming a 950 km extent of Greater India). These\nresults are all in agreement with the generally considered age\nof the India\u2010Asia collision determined using a variety of ap-\nproaches, as outlined in section 1. The paleomagnetic results\nfrom the Pana Formation [Tan et al., 2010] give a younger\ncollision age of 43 Ma. The data in their study are carefully\nanalyzed and valuable. However, caution should be taken\nwhen considering whether the sampled volcanic tuffs could\nrepresent a short\u2010term large eruption event potentially leading\nto a snapshot record of the Earth magnetic field at high\ninclination. A still younger age for India\u2010Asia collision is\nproposed with the paleomagnetic study of Aitchison et al.\n[2007] who calculate that there was considerable separation\nbetween the two continents at 55 Ma and thus they consider\ncollision at this time highly unlikely. Aitchison et al. use\nthe APWP plus a reasonable \u201cGreater India\u201d extent for the\ndetermination of India\u2019s northern margin at 55 Ma. Ali and\nAitchison [2005] have compiled a large number of different\nmodels for \u201cGreater India\u201d. The model for the extent of India\nand the northward movement used by Aitchison et al. [2007]\nis similar to that derived in Figure 9 based on Patzelt et al.\n[1996]. For the Asian side, Aitchison et al. ignore any post-\ncollisional north\u2010south shortening within the Tibetan Plateau\nand place the southern margin of the Lhasa Block at around\n30\u00b0N by simply using the APWP of Eurasia. We consider\nthis an unjustified approach. To relocate the southern margin\nof the Lhasa Block prior to collision one requires data from\nthe Lhasa Block itself, as outlined above. Aitchison et al.\nconsidered that no reliable Cenozoic data from this region\nwere available at the time of writing. We consider: first, that\nnew results subsequently published by Liebke et al. [2010],\nDupont\u2010Nivet et al. [2010], Chen et al. [2010], Sun et al.\n[2010], and Tan et al. [2010] improve the database for the\nPaleogene considerably. Second, according to Eurasia\u2019s\nrather stable APWP since the Cretaceous and the fact that the\nLhasa Block was accreted to Eurasia in Early Cretaceous\n[Baxter et al., 2009] crustal deformation and paleogeo-\ngraphical changes in this region were probably very minor\nsince the beginning of Cretaceous until the time of the India\u2010\nAsia collision.\nTable 1.

Timing of Cessation of Marine Facies\n[37] The age of the youngest marine facies in the Qumiba\nsection, dated by Wang et al. [2002] at \u223c34 Ma, is by far the\nyoungest marine facies reported in the suture zone so far, and\nis used by Aitchison et al. [2007] as supporting evidence for a\nlater timing of India\u2010Asia collision. However, as summarized\nin section 2, this age is disputed by Zhu et al. [2005]. While\nWang et al. consider the entire succession to be entirely\nmarine with the Enba Member to be of NP15\u201317 age, and\nthe disconformably overlying Zhaguo Member to be of\nNP18\u201320 age, Zhu et al. consider the Enba Formation to be\nmarine facies of P8 age (50.6 Ma), and the disconformably\noverlying Zaguo Formation to be considerably younger\ncontinental facies, containing reworked fauna. However,\nit must be recognized that the fauna recorded by Wang et al.,\nif correctly identified, would still record the youngest evi-\ndence of marine facies in the Tethyan Himalaya, whether\nreworked or in situ and furthermore, if the Zhaguo Member\nfacies interpretation of Wang et al. is adopted, the possibility\nof the prior existence of younger marine sedimentary rocks,\nremoved by overthrusting, cannot be ruled out.\n[38] Our data (section 3) show that regardless of the nature\nof the contact between the Enba and Zhaguo members, we\nfind no evidence for marine organisms younger than nanno-\nfossil zones NP12 or foraminifera zones P7\u20138 (ca. 50.6 Ma)\nin this unit, reworked or in situ. We therefore conclude\nthat there is no recorded evidence of continuation of marine\nfacies to the end of the Eocene at this locality as previously\nreported, and this sedimentary section cannot be used to\nsupport the contention that India\u2010Asia collision occurred at\n\u223c34 Ma. We also reiterate, as noted in section 1, the time of\ncessation of marine facies provides only a minimum age to\ncollision since marine conditions may persist on continental\ncrust for some time post collision.\n5.3. Beginning of Continental Molasse Sedimentation\nin the Suture Zone and Regional Sedimentation Patterns\n[39] The earliest known molasse containing detritus\nderived from both sides of the suture zone has recently been\nredated from Eocene to Miocene [Aitchison et al., 2002].\nHowever, we note that while the redating of this molasse does\nindeed remove this line of evidence for an Eocene collision, it\ndoes not require the collision to be Miocene; it only provides\nan \u201cupper bound\u201d to the age, as Aitchison et al. acknowledge\n[see also Davis et al., 2004]. Aitchison et al. [2007] also note\nthe delay between proposed 50 Ma collision and onset of\nsignificant sedimentation in the foreland basin and more\ndistal basins offshore. The cause of the time gap between\ncollision and significant recorded erosion from the orogen is\nintriguing, but a later collision is not the only way to explain\nthese data. As Aitchison et al. point out, a number of\nexplanations have been proposed for different basins e.g.,\nlack of preservation of early material due to overthrusting,\ncratonward migration of a forebulge, redistribution of the\nload, slab breakoff, negligible erosion due to an arid climate,\nand early subdued topography which can be attributed to a\nvariety of reasons [DeCelles et al., 1998; Guillot et al., 2003;\nNajman et al., 2004; Najman et al., 2008]. Furthermore, as\npointed out by Garzanti [2008] a delay to significant sedi-\nmentation following collision is not an unusual feature, also\nfound, for example, in the Alpine orogen [Garzanti and\nMalusa, 2008].\n5.4. Ending of Andean\u2010Type Calc\u2010Alkaline\nMagmatism on the Southern Margin of Asia\n[40] Aitchison et al. [2007] consider that subduction related\nmagmatism continued until at least 37 Ma thus providing\nsupporting evidence for a younger age of collision. However,\nwe believe the timing of cessation of subduction related\nmagmatism is difficult to define. Identification of the youn-\ngest subduction\u2010related magmatism is not straightforward,\nsince calc\u2010alkaline magmatism, typical of subduction\u2010related\nsettings, may persist into collisional regimes [Harris et al.,\n1990]. Ages as young as late Eocene have been recognized\nin the Trans\u2010Himalayan batholith, and discussed in the con-\ntext of their implications for determining the closure of\nTethys for over two decades [Searle et al., 1987] and then, as\nnow, these implications are not clear. Miller et al. [1999] and\nHarrison et al. [2000] record ages of 16\u201317 Ma and 30 Ma\nfor calc\u2010alkaline igneous rocks in southern Tibet which they\nconsider have geochemical signatures that are similar to\nundoubted subduction\u2010related suites such as the Trans\u2010\nHimalaya. Since the younger age range is clearly postcolli-\nsional, Harrison et al. consider that calc\u2010alkaline magmatism\nis thus a poor indicator of the timing of active subduction of\noceanic lithosphere beneath a continental margin, and provide\nother potential explanations for its occurrence. By contrast,\nChung et al. [2003, 2005] disagree that the geochemistry is\nsimilar to the subduction\u2010related Trans\u2010Himalaya and rein-\nterpret the rocks as collision\u2010related adakites. In their view,\n\u201csoft collision\u201d (first contact between the continental mar-\ngins) occurred around 60 Ma. Slab roll back accompanied by\nsouthward migration of asthenospheric convection beneath\nTibet was responsible for the Cenozoic magmatism, which\nwas terminated by slab breakoff at \u223c45 Ma which resulted\nin cessation of subduction and \u201chard collision.\u201d\n[41] Therefore the interpretation of the tectonic environ-\nment of these rocks is not clear\u2010cut. What is clear is that\ncalc\u2010alkaline magmatism with adakite\u2010like characteristics\nin southern Tibet is now known to range in age from Early\nCretaceous to the lateMiocene, and so has formed throughout\nperiods of subduction of oceanic lithosphere, continent col-\nlision and postcollision tectonics. Since these magmas have\nformed in highly diverse tectonic settings, their only shared\npetrogenetic factor is the presence of garnet in the source\nwhich reduces the HREE and Y abundances in the melt,\nirrespective of tectonic setting [Zhang et al., 2010]. Thus the\ngeochemistry of these rocks cannot unequivocally be used to\ndate the timing of cessation of subduction and subsequent\ncontinent collision.\n5.5. Initiation of Major Thrusting\n[42] Aitchison et al. [2007] contend that initiation of major\ncollision\u2010related thrust systems is an immediate response to\nall active collisions on earth today. With regard to the timing\nof development of collision\u2010related thrust systems in the\nHimalaya, Aitchison et al. in fact acknowledge that \u201cPaleo-\ncene\u2010early Eocene regional crustal shortening\u2026.. is recorded\nin the Tethyan Himalaya\u201d which, we note, would be entirely\nconsistent with a rapid response to India\u2010Asia collision\naround 55\u201350 Ma. However, Aitchison et al. prefer to\nNAJMAN ET AL: TIMING OF INDIA\u2010ASIA COLLISION B12416B12416\n15 of 18\ninterpret this tectonism to be the result of collision at 55 Ma\nbetween an intraoceanic arc (Dazhuqu, Bainang and Zedong\nterrains of south Tibet) [Aitchison et al., 2000] and India,\nprior to India\u2010Asia collision.\n6. Conclusions\n[43] The Tethyan Himalayan Qumiba section in southern\nTibet records the transition from the ca 53\u201354 Ma aged car-\nbonates of the Zephure Shan Formation to the 50.6\u201352.8 Ma\naged clastics of the overlying Pengqu Formation. Our\nbiostratigraphic dating of the Pengqu Formation at 50.6\u2013\n52.8 Ma is consistent with the dating of Zhu et al. [2005] at\nthis locality, but at variance with the middle to late Eocene\nage of Wang et al. [2002]. In our view, these rocks do not\ntherefore provide evidence of a latest Eocene (late Priabo-\nnian) cessation to the time of marine facies in the orogen as\npreviously proposed and cannot be used to support the pro-\nposal of India\u2010Asia collision <35 Ma [Aitchison et al., 2007].\n[44] Cretaceous\u2013earliest Eocene U\u2010Pb ages of detrital\nzircons from the Pengqu Formation are consistent with der-\nivation from the Asian Trans\u2010Himalaya and inconsistent with\nderivation from the Indian plate, and thus we interpret the\nPengqu Formation to represent the record of the first arrival of\nAsian detritus on to the Indian plate at this locality, thereby\nconstraining India\u2010Asia collision at prior to 50.6 Ma. Prov-\nenance from a Late Jurassic intraoceanic arc colliding with\nIndia at this time has also been proposed for these rocks\n[Aitchison et al., 2007], with India\u2010Asia collision occurring\nonly in the Oligocene, but until zircons of similar age to the\nPengqu Formation are recorded in this arc, and zircons of\nJurassic age are found in the Pengqu Formation, we prefer to\ninterpret the detritus as Asian derived.\n[45] Additional evidence for a proposed Oligocene India\u2010\nAsia collision has been put forward by Aitchison et al. [2007],\nnamely (1) their reconstruction of the relative positions of\nIndia and Asia in the Cenozoic show wide separation of the\ncontinents at 55 Ma and (2) their geological evidence of\nthe time of cessation of marine facies (as discussed above),\nthe age of the oldest recorded postcollisional molasse and\nonset of major orogen\u2010derived sedimentation, the timing of\ncessation of subduction\u2010relatedmagmatism, and the timing of\nmajor thrusting in the orogen, are all proposed to have\noccurred later than previously believed. We provide alterna-\ntive arguments for each of these lines of evidence.We provide\na synthesis of palaeomagnetic data from which we interpret\nthat initial contact between the continents occurred in the\nearly Eocene. We argue that a delay to the timing of onset of\nerosion from the orogen may be explained by later collision,\nbut could equally well be explained by a number of other\nfactors. We argue that the calc\u2010alkaline rocks formed in\nhighly diverse tectonic settings not restricted to subduction\nregimes. Finally we reiterate the fact that major thrusting is\nrecorded in the orogen shortly after collision.\n[46] We therefore consider that the view of Aitchison et al.\n[2007], that the geological record and relative positions of\nIndia and Asia \u201cdemand\u201d that the continental collision\noccurred no earlier than the Oligocene, is overstated. Colli-\nsion of India with an intraoceanic arc at \u223c55Mamay well be a\nviable theory worthy of further investigation, and certainly\ncollisions between island arcs and continents are capable of\nproducing significant orogeny, e.g., the Taconic Orogeny,\nUSA [Stanley and Ratcliffe, 1985]. However, available evi-\ndence does not currently \u201cdemand\u201d that collision between\nIndia and Asia occurred no earlier than the Oligocene;\navailable evidence also remains consistent with collision by\n\u223c50 Ma.\n[47] Acknowledgments.
