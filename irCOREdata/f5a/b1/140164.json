This study was undertaken to15\ninvestigate the possibility of modifying this model for new soil textures, namely loamy16\nsand, loam, silt loam and silt loam\/silt soils. Using the on-line measurement system of BD,17\nmeasurements were carried out in 4 fields with different average textures of loam, sandy18\nloam and silt loam and silt loam\/silt fields. The on-line measurement system used consisted19\nof a subsoiler, whom draught (D) was measured with a single shear beam load cell and20\ndepth (d) was measured with a wheel gauge consisted of a swinging arm metal wheel21\nequipped with a linear variable differential transducer (LVDT). The soil gravimetric22\nmoisture content (MC) was measured with the oven drying method. The on-line measured23\nBD was compared with measured BD with Kopecki rings (core sampling method) (73624\nsamples), to validate the potential use of this sensor in the new studied soil textures.25\nResults showed that the BD model can be used for on-line measurement of soil compaction26\nfor the selected textures. It was found that the correction factor (M) of this model was27\nmainly sensitive to variable MC, and slightly sensitive to clay content. The M at field scale28\nvaried between 0.994 (silt loam\/silt soil with an average MC of 0.279 kg kg-1) and 1.17129\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 98-104\n2\n(loam soil with an average MC of 0.105 kg kg-1). At almost the same texture, M varied1\nbetween 1.171 for an average MC of 0.105 kg kg-1 and 1.122 for an average MC of 0.1862\nkg kg-1, which proves the domination of MC effect on M. The multiple linear regression3\n(MLR) analysis (ANNOVA) performed between MC and clay and M retained MC as M4\npredictor (P < 0.001, R2 = 0.86). This MLR resulted in similar prediction accuracy of5\ncompacted zones as compared to the linear regression model between MC and M. In a6\nvariable texture field, the corrected BD model resulted in remarkable spatial similarity of7\nBD between the corrected on-line and core sampling method. Therefore, it can be8\nconcluded that the BD model with the new M can be used for on-line measurement of soil9\ncompaction in loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, and silt soils at different MC,10\nbearing in mind that the difference in clay content is minimal (83 to 175 g kg-1).11\n12\nKeywords: bulk density; on-line measurement; sensor; texture; mapping.13\n14\n*Corresponding Author.

Introduction18\n19\nSoil compaction owing to the impact of the natural factors, heavy agricultural machinery20\nand improper tillage system limits plant growth and crop yield (Vrindts et al., 2005). This21\nphenomenon can cause increase in the bulk density (BD) and penetration resistance, while22\ndecrease in porosity and void ratio takes place. This leads to changes in the hydraulic23\nproperties of soil, especially the decrease of the saturated conductivity and the air filled24\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 98-104\n3\nporosity at a suction of -50 or -100 cm H2O, which is much more important than the1\nincrease in BD. However, the on-line measurement of soil compaction can only be2\nrealistically done by indirect measurement of BD or penetration resistance. Unlike the3\npenetration resistance, BD seems more likely to represent soil compaction, since it is not4\naffected by moisture content (MC) during measurement. Bardy (1984) reported that the BD5\nvalues of clay, clay loam, and silt loam surface soils normally may range from 1.0 to as6\nhigh as 1.6 Mg m-3, depending on their conditions. A variation from 1.2 to 1.8 Mg m-3 may7\nbe found in sands and sandy loams. Very compacted subsoils may have BD values of 2.08\nMg m-3 or even greater. Grossman (1981) proposed non-limiting BD values for plant9\ngrowth of 1.3 Mg m-3 and 1.6 Mg m-3 for clayey and sandy soils, respectively. Root limiting10\nBD values of 1.47 Mg m-3 and 1.85 Mg m-3 were proposed by Grossman and Berdanier11\n(1982) for clayey and sandy soils, respectively. Critical BD values of 1.39 Mg m-3 and 1.6912\nMg m-3 were defined for clayey and sandy soil, respectively as the BD values that13\ncorrespond to a 20 % increase in total porosity relative to that of the limiting BD. Based on14\nexperience, Singh et al. (1992) defined maximum BD value of 2.1 Mg m-3, which may be15\nconsidered as unrootable by plants.16\nThe measurement of BD by the Kopecki rings (core sampling method) is a labour intensive17\nand time costly procedure; in addition to the discontinuous data output obtained based on18\nfine or coarse measurement grids. Draught and\/or penetration resistance were considered to19\nindicate soil compaction (Hemmat and Adamchuk, 2008). They are measured by using20\ndifferent load cells (Sprinkle et al., 1970; Upadhyaya et al., 1984; Hayhoe et al., 2002;21\nVerschoore et al., 2003, Nam\u00e9nyi et al., 2006) or strain gauges (Glancey et al., 1989).22\nThese mechanical methods provide on-line measurement of soil resistance for a specific23\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 98-104\n4\ngeometry of soil cutting tool, while the most influencing factors affecting the magnitude of1\nthe soil resistance, namely BD, MC and soil depth (d) were not taken into consideration.2\nBased on a combination of a finite element and multiple linear regression analyses,3\nMouazen et al. (2003a) developed the following model for the calculation of soil4\ncompaction indicated as BD that was valid for a sandy loam field (Zoutleeuw 1 Field in5\nTable 1):6\n7\n3\n. - .\n( )\n.\n2D 21 36 MC 73 9313d\nBD\n1 6734\n\uf02b\uf03d (1)8\n9\nwhere D is subsoiler draught [kN], MC is gravimetric moisture content [kg kg-1], d is10\ncutting depth [m] and BD is bulk density [Mg m-3].11\nEquation (1) was modified empirically for sandy loam field by adding an average12\ncorrection factor (M) of 1.14 (Mouazen et al., 2003b), which was the average error of BD13\nbetween calculated values using Eqn (1) and measurement values with the core sampling14\nmethod:15\n16\n3\n. - .\n( )\n.\n\uf02b\uf03d \uf0b4\n2D 21 36 MC 73 9313d\nBD 1.14\n1 6734\n(2)17\n18\nUsing Eqn (2), soil compaction indicated as BD can be determined on-line, if D of the19\ncutting tool (subsoiler), cutting d and MC are measured on-line (Mouazen and Ramon20\n2006). So far, Eqn (2) was tested and validated for sandy loam field (Zoutleeuw 1 field in21\nTable 1) (Mouazen et al., 2003b; Mouazen and Ramon 2006), for which BD may vary22\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 98-104\n5\nbetween 1.2 and 1.8 Mg m-3 (Bardy, 1984). For a new soil texture other than sandy loam1\nand loam, a field experiment is needed to establish a new M valid for a texture dominated2\nin a field.3\nThis study aims to modify a BD model established originally for a sandy loam field to be4\nused for loamy sand, silt loam, loam and silt soils by means of field experiments. The5\nreliability of the on-line BD map was investigated, for one example field, by comparing6\nwith a BD map measured with the traditional core sampling method.7\n8\n2. Materials and methods9\n10\n2.1. On-line measurement system of bulk density11\n12\nA standard medium-deep subsoiler used as soil cutting tool was attached to a frame,13\nwhich was mounted onto the three point hitch of the tractor. The subsoiler consisted of two14\nparts; the chisel of 0.06 m width, and the shank of 0.03 m width (Mouazen et al., 2003a). In15\naddition to the sensor electrical system, a commercially available single ended shear beam16\nload cell from CELTRON TECHNOLOGIES Inc. used to measure subsoiler D, a wheel17\ngauge equipped with a linear variable differential transducer (LVDT) to measure d and a18\nvisible and near infrared spectrophotometer to measure MC were used. A more detailed19\ndescription about the on-line measurement system can by found in Mouazen and Ramon20\n(2006).21\n22\n2.2. Experimental fields and measurement23\n24\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 98-104\n6\nThe field experiments were carried out in four fields spread over an area of 50 km in1\ndiameter at east of Brussels. These experimental fields are located in Zoutleeuw, Heverlee,2\nLeefdaal and Lovenjoel villages, in which measurements were carried out after wheat3\nharvest in summer 2003 and after maize harvest in fall 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.4\nThe size of these fields varied between 7 ha (Zoutleeuw) and 1 ha (Lovenjoel). The soil5\ntexture fractions were determined by a combination of wet sieve and hydrometer tests,6\nusing the United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) soil classification. The average7\ntextures of the experimental fields down to a depth of 0.2 m were sandy loam, loam, silt8\nloam and silt loam\/silt textures, as given in Table 1 and Fig. (2a). Soil organic matter of the9\nstudied fields determined by the method of dry combustion is reported in Table 1. It should10\nbe noticed that in Table 1 and Fig. (2a), two Zoutleeuw fields were indicated. In fact, they11\nare the same field, but Zoutleeuw 2 is larger in size and includes Zoutleeuw 1, for which12\nresults about on-line measurement of soil compaction was reported previously (Mouazen13\nand Ramon, 2006). In all fields, average field texture was considered by collecting an14\naverage sample from arbitrarily selected spots in the field, except Lovenjoel field where15\naverage line texture was considered. In Lovenjoel field 6 experimental lines were selected,16\nfor which 6 different average line textures were obtained (Figs. 2b and 3). In this particular17\nfield, soil becomes heavier throughout the South - North direction (Table 2 and Fig. 3),18\nwhich can be attributed to the influence of slope. In this direction silt increases19\nconsiderably, while only slight increase in clay takes place.20\nAfter setting up the different sensors, the subsoiler was pulled throughout parallel lines21\nof 10 m apart, as shown in Fig. (3) for Lovenjoel field, as an example. The subsoiler was22\ndriven at a travel speed of 1200 \u2013 1500 m h-1, setting the chisel tip at a d of 0.15 m. Before23\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 98-104\n7\nmeasurement of each line, samples of soil were collected at each 10 m distance (Fig. 3)1\nwith Kopecki rings (a core sampling device), whose cylinder volume was 100 cm3 with 52\ncm height. These samples were used for the determination of BD and MC by the oven3\ndrying method (105\u00ba C for 24 hours). They were collected just before running the subsoiler4\nto eliminate error in measuring BD due to soil loosening by the subsoiler. Since the5\nvariation of BD of the topsoil was the point of interest of this study, core samples were6\ntaken at a shallow d by pushing the cylinder bottom within the soil down to a d of about7\n0.12 \u2013 0.15 m.8\n9\n2.3. Development of BD maps10\n11\nThe ARCVIEW GIS 3.1 software was used to develop the BD maps. All BD maps were12\ndeveloped based on a 10 m by 10 m data grid in order to harmonise the resolution of all13\nmaps (Fig. 3). The grid was interpolated using the inverse distance weighing (IDW)14\nmethod. The interpolation grid size of all maps had a radius of 25 m and a power of 2, with15\na map cell size of 1 m2.16\n17\n3. Results18\n19\n3.1. Maps of bulk density20\n21\nAlthough data of BD are available for all four fields, only Lovenjoel field will be22\nselected, as an example, to discuss BD maps. This is done because the soil texture for each23\nof the six measurement lines of Lovenjoel field was measured (Table 2), which will be24\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 98-104\n8\nmore beneficial to understand the correlation between BD and texture variation over the1\nfields. In the other three fields, texture was determined based on one average sample2\nselected randomly over a field area. Table 2 shows the presence of texture variation in3\nLovenjoel field even over the small field area of about 1ha. This texture variation confirms4\nthat the actual spatial variation in field texture can not be represented by only one average5\nfield texture sample.6\nSpatial similarity between on-line measured (Eqn 1) and core sampling measured BD7\nmaps (Fig. 4) can be determined by visual comparison. Compaction zones are properly8\ndetected by the on-line compaction sensor. However, using the on-line sensor and the9\ncompaction model of Eqn (1) without incorporating M provided under-estimation of BD.10\nThis under-estimation was remarkably clear for all studied fields except for that of11\nHeverlee field (Table 3), in which MC was the largest (average of 0.279 kg kg-1) as12\ncompared to the other fields. Furthermore, the degree of under-estimation of BD for the13\nthree fields (Zoutleeuw, Lovenjoel and Leefdaal) was different. This emphasises the need14\nfor further investigation to figure out the reason of the under- or over-estimation of BD15\nobtained from the on-line sensor and the compaction model of Eqn (1) under different soil16\nMC and textures.17\n18\n3.2. Evaluation of the effect of different measurement parameters on error of bulk density19\nmodel20\n21\nIn order to evaluate the reason for variable estimation of BD using Eqn (1) and on-line22\nsensor among different measurement fields, simple plots of MC vs M for all measurement23\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 98-104\n9\npoints (M = measured BD with core sampling method \/ on-line measured BD using Eqn1\n(1)), D vs M and d vs M are shown in Fig. 5. A total of 736 samples collected from the four2\nexperimental fields were considered. A clear separation of the four field samples into 43\ngroups can only be seen in MC vs M plot. Furthermore, the clear decreasing trend of M can4\nonly be seen with MC (Fig. 5a), suggesting the significant effect of MC on the accuracy of5\nthe on-line measured BD and hence M of BD model (Eqn 1). The average calculated M at6\nfield scale varied between 0.994 in Heverlee field (silt loam\/silt soil with an average MC of7\n0.279 kg kg-1) and 1.171 in Zoutleeuw 2 (loam soil with an average MC of 0.105 kg kg-1).8\nAt almost the same texture, M varied between 1.171 (Zoutleeuw 2) for an average MC of9\n0.105 kg kg-1 and 1.122 (Lovenjoel) for an average MC of 0.186 kg kg-1, which is a further10\nproof of the domination of MC effect on M.11\nIn order to quantify the effect of each of the measured parameters on M of BD model,12\nlinear regression correlation between the average field value of a measured property (MC,13\nD, d, sand, silt and clay) and average calculated M was carried out. All fields were14\nconsidered in the linear correlation, except Heverlee field, since the average MC of this15\nfield was larger than the maximum MC considered to establish the BD model given by Eqn16\n(1). In fact, this BD model is valid for a MC range of 0.03 to 0.22 kg kg-1 (Mouazen et al.,17\n2003a), which makes including calculations of Heverlee field with an average MC of 0.27918\nkg kg-1 is incorrect. The values of the determination coefficient R2 between average field M19\nand average field measured parameters are given in Table 4. It is clear that all these20\ncorrelations are rather weak, except the correlation between MC and M (R2 = 0.99), which21\nis a proof of the large effect of MC on the accuracy of BD prediction using the model of22\nEqn (1). The correlation results between M and silt and sand fractions are weak (Table 4),23\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 98-104\n10\nproviding that no clear effect of the two main texture fractions (sand or silt) on M can be1\nestablished for the studied soils. Although among the three texture fractions the range of2\nvariation was the smallest for clay (83 \u2013 175 gkg-1), the correlation between M and clay is3\nthe largest and can be considered as moderate.4\n5\n3.3. Correction of BD model6\n7\nIn order to establish a new M accounting for soil texture, a multiple linear analysis was8\ncarried out between MC (strong effect on M) and clay (moderate effect on M) and M. The9\nresult of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of is shown in Table 5, which indicated a10\nsignificant effect of only MC on M (P < 0.001, R2 = 0.89). Since the MC had the ultimate11\neffect on M, a simple linear regression (LR) analysis was also carried out between MC and12\nM. The LR and MLR resulted in two new M, which are incorporated into Eqn (1) to obtain13\nnew BD models, written, respectively, as follow:14\n15\n3\n. - .\n( ) ( .\n.\n\uf02b\uf03d \uf0b4\n2D 21 36 MC 73 9313d\nBD 1.240 - 0 592MC - 0.000792clay)\n1 6734\n(5)16\n17\n3\n. - .\n( ) ( .772\n.\n\uf02b\uf03d \uf0b4\n2D 21 36 MC 73 9313d\nBD 1.255 - 0 MC)\n1 6734\n(6)18\n19\nWhere clay is expressed in %.20\n21\n4. Discussion:22\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 98-104\n11\n1\nEquations (5 and 6) were used to calculate the corrected BD of Lovenjoel field by2\nutilising the on-line measured D, MC and d. Due to the dominant effect of MC, both3\nmodels provided similar prediction accuracies of BD and distribution of compacted zones.4\nA slight improvement of Eqn (5) over Eqn (6) for capturing the high BD values was5\nrecorded. Therefore, the former equation was adopted to calculate the corrected BD and to6\ndevelop a corrected BD map. This corrected on-line BD map (Fig. 6) is quite similar to the7\ncorresponding map measured with the core sampling method (Fig. 4a). The spatial8\ndistribution of the corrected BD map of Fig. (6) is better than the calculated uncorrected9\nBD map (Fig. 4b) as visually compared to that of measured BD with the core sampling10\nmethod (Fig. 4a). The improvement reflected not only on the spatial distribution of BD, but11\nalso on the linear correlation between on-line and core sampling methods. This correction12\nresulted in a higher R2 value of 0.52 between the corrected on-line measured BD and the13\ncore sampling measured BD, as compared to that of the uncorrected on-line measured BD14\nand sampling measured BD (R2 = 0.47).15\nThe BD error between the core sampling method and the on-line method in Lovenjoel16\nfield is shown in Fig. 7. A large skewness resulted from the under-estimation of BD model17\nwithout correction (Eqn 1) is shown in Fig. 7a. By using the corrected model of Eqn 5, the18\nerror becomes normally distributed around zero (Fig. 7b). The error of the corrected on-line19\nmeasured BD ranges from -0.231 to 0.217 Mg m-3 with a standard deviation and average20\nerror of 0.087 Mg m-3 and 0.001 Mg m-3 (Table 6), respectively. Table 6 also proves that the21\naverage relative error was considerably smaller in correspondence to the corrected BD22\n(0.07 %), as compared to the uncorrected BD (10.97 %). Indeed, the improved results of23\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 98-104\n12\non-line measured BD after correction with Eqn (3) recorded not only for Lovenjoel field1\nbut on the other two experimental fields (Table 6).2\nIn spite of the fact that Lovenjoel field is of variable textures of loamy sand, sandy3\nloam, loam, and silt loam textures (Table 2 and Fig. 2b), the combination of the on-line4\nmeasurement system and corrected BD model (Eqn 5) is capable to detect the spatial5\nvariation of soil compaction indicated as BD. Furthermore, although soil becomes heavier6\nthroughout the South - North direction (Table 2 and Fig. 3), along with BD is expected to7\ndecrease, the on-line sensing system was capable to capture the compacted spots at the8\nnorthern edge (heaviest part) of the field. This implies that the studied texture classes those9\nlocated at the base of the texture triangle of the USDA classification system need no further10\ncalibration of BD model as long as the clay content does not exceed 200 g kg-1 (83 to 175 g11\nkg-1). For these texture classes M is mainly affected by MC and minimally by clay content,12\nwhich might be due to the small range of clay variation. The promising readings of the13\nerror statistics between the core sampling and corrected on-line measurements of BD is the14\nproof for the successful expansion of the BD model for new experimental fields with15\ndifferent textures of loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, silt loam and silt. It is recommended to16\ncarry out similar calibration procedure of the on-line measurement system for another soil17\ntextures with bigger variation in clay content in order to establish general correction factors,18\nallowing the on-line measurement system to be of possible use for all available textures in19\nagricultural soils. The texture triangle of the United State Department of Agriculture20\n(USDA) has to be divided into 3-4 parts, for each a calibration factor has to be developed.21\n22\n5. Conclusions23\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 98-104\n13\n1\nThe possibility of expanding the use of an on-line measurement system of soil2\ncompaction indicated as bulk density (BD) from sandy loam field to loamy sand, loam, silt3\nloam and silt soils was investigated. Experiments were performed in four experimental4\nfields to compare between the Kopecki rings (core sampling method) and on-line measured5\nBD, aiming at establishing a new correction factor (M) of BD model proper for the soils6\ninvestigated. From the results obtained, the following conclusions can be drawn:7\n- The gravimetric soil moisture content (MC) has the only significant effect (P <8\n0.001, R2 = 0.86) on M and subsequently on the on-line predicted BD.9\n- The soil clay fraction has the largest effect on M as compared to silt and sand10\nfractions, although this effect was found to be small (P = 0.527). However, a slight11\nimprovement for capturing the high BD values was obtained when the clay content12\nwas included in the multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis together with MC.13\n- A new M that accounts for variable MC and clay was recommended to be14\nincorporated into BD model, which led to smaller errors and better spatial15\ndistribution of BD obtained by the on-line measurement system.16\n- The previously developed BD model used for on-line measurement system of soil17\ncompaction can be expanded for new soil textures, namely, loamy sand, loam,18\nsandy loam, silt loam and silt textures.19\n- This calibration procedure is only valid for limited variation in clay content (e.g. 8320\n\u2013 175 gkg-1).21\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 98-104\n14\nTo account for new soil textures than those considered in the current study, further field1\nexperiments are needed to provide new M, which might or might not be significantly2\nsensitive to texture variation.3\n4\nReferences5\n6\nBardy, N.
