Lekakou*, A. Hearn, A. K. Murugesh and B. Le Page\nTwo liquid composite moulding techniques have been investigated in this study, resin transfer\nmoulding (RTM) and resin infusion under flexible tool (RIFT) for the processing of glass fabric\u2013\nepoxy laminates with 5% nanoaggregates of silica nanoparticles in the epoxy matrix. It has been\nfound that the high fibre fraction reinforcement (Vf50.50) filters the silica nanoaggregates\nresulting in stopping the in plane resin infiltration in RTM right at the beginning of the filling stage.\nLaminates of lower fibre fraction (Vf50.40) were produced successfully by RIFT. Dynamic\nmechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and three point bend tests showed that fibre\u2013silica\u2013epoxy\ncomposites, processed by RIFT, had higher elastic shear modulus and interlaminar shear\nstrength than conventional fibre\u2013epoxy composites manufactured by the same RIFT process.\nKeywords: Nanocomposites, Liquid composite moulding, RTM, RIFT\nIntroduction\nThermoset matrices in fibre reinforced polymers are\noften brittle and a number of routes have been tried for\nimproving their toughness. One way of improvement is\nto create a three phase composite material, by including\nanother reinforcing dispersed phase in the polymer\nmatrix in the form of rigid particles,1\u20133 among others,\nfor example. In this case, it has been suggested4 that the\nparticles are well dispersed at a critical distance apart so\nthat they allow for a polymer shell of sufficient thickness\naround each particle that interacts with the particle\nsurface and defines the properties of the particle\/polymer\ninterface which might differ from those of the bulk\npolymer matrix. Nanocomposites with well dispersed\nnanoparticles have a very large surface area of\nnanoparticles and, as a result, a large amount of\ninterfacial material between each nanoparticle and the\nbulk polymer matrix.\nNanoparticles have been reported to benefit polymers\nin various ways, including retaining transparency. Clay\nnanocomposites have been under investigation to\nimprove certain polymer properties, such as thermal\nstability,5 fire retardancy,6 flexural modulus and\nstrength and toughness,5,7 barrier properties,7\u20139 which\nmight improve hydrothermal aging,9 and lower shrink-\nage.10 Silica nanocomposites have been reported to\ndisplay increased mechanical properties11,12 such as\nmodulus, tensile, flexural and impact strength up to a\ncertain silica content (e.g. 2.5%)13 and decreased\nmechanical properties thereafter, improved fracture\ntoughness14 and better thermal stability.15,16\nHybrid composites including fibre reinforcement in a\npolymer matrix with dispersed nanoparticles have been\nthe subject of several recent studies where it has been\nreported that the nanoparticle\u2013fibre composites, when\ncompared with the corresponding fibre composites,\ndisplayed higher in plane shear strength (glass fibre\u2013\norganoclay\u2013epoxy composites17), increased interlaminar\nshear strength, flexural strength, flexural modulus and\nfracture toughness (glass fibre\u2013clay\u2013vinyl ester com-\nposites,5 glass fibre\u2013clay\u2013epoxy composites,18 carbon\nfibre\u2013clay\u2013epoxy composites,19 glass fibre\u2013silica\u2013epoxy\ncomposites11) and better thermal properties.5,18\nHowever, there are no studies on the processability of\nsuch composites, especially at relatively high fibre\ncontent. The vacuum hand lay up process has been\nused in some studies17,20 as it is not only simple but\npossibly also because it involves impregnation of the\nnanoresin system only through the short path of the\nthickness of the laminate. Resin transfer moulding has\nbeen used21 for very low content, 17%, of short fibres\nwhere even clay clusters of 1.5 mm impregnated the fibre\nmat successfully in radial outwards flow.\nThis study starts with an investigation of the\nprocessability of an epoxy resin with 5% nanoaggregates\nof WACKER silica particles, continues with an explora-\ntion of two liquid composite moulding techniques, resin\ntransfer moulding (RTM) and resin infusion under\nflexible tool (RIFT), to produce fibre nanocomposites,\nand finally assesses the presence of silica nanoparticles\nand their effect on matrix dominated properties, namely\nshear modulus and interlaminar shear strength.\nMaterials\nThe matrix was an epoxy comprising Araldite LY564,\nbased on a bisphenol A epoxy resin with a reactive\ndiluent, and Hardener HY 2954, a cycloaliphatic amine,\nsupplied by Ciba Polymers.

After the dispersion of the silica nanoparticles,\nHardener HY 2954 was added at an Araldite LY\n564 :Hardener HY 2954 weight ratio of 100 : 35 to effect\nthe curing of epoxy, resulting in an epoxy matrix with\ny5 wt-% silica.\nWACKER HDK N20 silica powder was used,\nproduced by WACKER SILICONES in the following\nprocess:22 primary silica nanoparticles of y10 nm are\nproduced during the hydrolysis of trichlorosilane in a\nhydrogen\/oxygen flame at y1200uC; in the flame the\nprimary particles fuse into aggregates of about 100 to\n500 nm; on cooling, the aggregates flocculate to form\nagglomerates of about 10\u201350 mm, also called tertiary\nstructures. The aggregates consist of primary particles\nthat have fused to form a face to face sintered structure\nand, hence, cannot be separated by physical means.\nAn E glass plain woven fabric, Y0212, supplied by\nFothergill Engineered Fabrics, was used as the fibre\nreinforcement in this study in an assembly of several\nlayers, laid up as warp to warp and weft to weft. The\nfabric had an area density of 0.546 kg m22, a nominal\nthickness of 0.48 mm, 6.7 ends\/10 mm and 6.3 picks\/\n10 mm (Ref. 23).\nMixing and rheology of silica\u2013epoxy\nsystem\nThe silica powder was dispersed in the epoxy resin in\na solvent aided procedure to ensure homogeneous\nmixing,24 where ethanol was the solvent employed.\nA suspension was produced with 10 g of WACKER\nHDK N20 powder in 120 mL ethanol and was sonicated\nin an ultrasonic bath at room temperature for 30 min\nto disperse the silica nanoparticles. Araldite LY564\n(140 mL) was added to the mixture and the system was\nmixed mechanically at 1000 rev min21 for 30 min. The\nsystem was left in an oven at 100uC under vacuum\nfor 5 h to remove the ethanol. The hardener was then\nadded and mixed mechanically at 1000 rev min21 for\n5 min.\nFigure 1 displays the complex viscosity of the silica\u2013\nepoxy curing system monitored in a DMTA test in a\nRheometrics RDA II instrument at room temperature\nand a frequency of 1.6 Hz. It is easily observed that the\nsilica nanoparticles lower the gelling time of the system\n(324 min for the silica\u2013epoxy system against 440 min for\nthe pure epoxy system at the same high viscosity value),\nowing to both the locking effect of the rigid silica\nparticles and also the promotion of curing by the silica\nnanoparticles, as demonstrated in DSC studies.24 This\nmeans that the process time of the silica\u2013epoxy system\nfor the infiltration stage in liquid composite moulding is\ngoing to be much shorter than that of the pure epoxy\nsystem.\nRTM experiments\nThe experiments were carried out in an RTM mould of\n3506350 mm with either side or central injection25,26 at\n200 kPa injection pressure and room temperature. The\n10 layers of woven fabrics were compressed at a fibre\nfraction Vf50.50 when the mould was closed. The resin\nwas maintained at room temperature to avoid prema-\nture gelling, especially taking into account the shorter\ngel time owing to the presence of nanoparticles in the\nresin.\nIn all experiments, the resin flow stopped after a few\nminutes at a maximum infiltration length of y100 mm\nalthough the resin had not gelled yet from what it could\nbe deduced about the resin in the flexible inlet tube. The\nresin was allowed to cure, the laminate was removed\nfrom the mould and specimens were sectioned at\ndifferent distances from the inlet. The specimens\ncharacterised in this study were from a moulding\nproduced from a side channel inlet. The specimens were\nfractured, their fracture surface was gold coated and\nexamined by SEM.\nFigure 2 displays an SEM micrograph of the fracture\nsurface of a 5% silica\u2013epoxy nanocomposite (without\nfibre reinforcement) where the silica\u2013epoxy system was\nsimply left to cure. The surface consists of features of\n50\u2013100 nm that have been attributed24 to well dispersed\nsilica nanoparticles which led to such roughness\ncharacteristics in the fracture surface.\nFigure 3 presents SEM images from different regions\nof the glass fibre\u2013silica\u2013epoxy specimens produced by\nRTM. The resin region at 20 mm from the gate (Fig. 3a)\npresents some roughness characteristics, indicating the\npresence of nanoparticle aggregates, although the\nfeatures are smoother than those in the silica\u2013epoxy\nnanocomposite in Fig. 2. However, the resin region at\n70 mm from the gate (Fig. 3b) seems totally smooth\nindicating the brittle failure of pure epoxy without\nnanoparticles.\n1 Rheological data during curing from DMTA tests at\n1.6 Hz and 20uC\n2 Iamge (SEM) of 5 wt-% silica\u2013epoxy nanocomposite\nproduced following mixing procedure described in the\nsection on \u2018Mixing and rheology of silica\u2013epoxy sys-\ntem\u2019\nLekakou et al.

In this case, a \u2018filter cake\u2019 is\nformed in the porous fibre medium at the inlet and the\nresin flow stops, as it indeed happened in all RTM\nexperiments.\nRIFT experiments\nNine 2206220 mm layers of glass fibre fabric Y0212 were\nlaid in the RIFT process. A spring was adjusted at one side\nof the fibre reinforcement, over the resin inlet, to create a\nfast resin flow channel as a side inlet (Fig. 4). The whole\nassembly was covered by a vacuum bag, sealed at the edges\nand the silica\u2013epoxy system infused the reinforcement\nunder vacuum at room temperature (Fig. 5) and was left to\ncure at room temperature over a period of 3 days. Fibre\ncomposites were produced successfully using either pure\nepoxy or silica\u2013epoxy resin.\nSpecimens were sectioned from the above mouldings\nand subjected to various tests. Since the tensile moduli\nalong the warp and weft directions of the woven\nreinforcement are expected to be fibre dominated,\ntesting focused on the shear properties, which are\nexpected to be matrix dominated, in order to determine\nwhether the silica nanoparticles would make any\ndifference to these properties. Dynamic mechanical\nthermal analysis tests were carried out in an RDA II\nrheometrics instrument at a constant frequency of\n1.6 Hz and a strain of 0.1% while the temperature was\nraised at 10 K min21 up to 120uC. Three point bend\ntests were performed using an Instron 1175 5500R\nUniversal Testing Machine at a crosshead speed of\n0.5 mm min21 with specimen dimensions and design of\nthe test specified so that the specimens would fail under\ninterlaminar shear stress rather than flexure.27\nResults of characterisation and\nmechanical testing\nThe thickness H of the laminates was measured and the\nfibre volume fraction Vf was calculated from the relation\nVf~\nNra\nrfH\n(1)\nwhere N is the number of fabric layers, ra is the area\ndensity of the fabric, rf is the E glass fibre density\nrf52560 kg m\n23. All RIFT laminates had a Vf in the\nrange of 0.4120.42, which is relatively low as expected\nowing to the low consolidation pressure of a nominal\nvacuum.\nFigure 6 displays the elastic shear modulus, G9, against\ntemperature obtained from DMTA tests for a fibre\u2013pure\nepoxy sample and a fibre\u20135% nanosilica\u2013epoxy sample.\nThis is a matrix dominated property and it can be easily\nseen that at room temperature the nano-fibre composite\nhas a G9 of 3.1 GPa, twice that of the fibre composite\nwithout the nanoparticles for which G951.6 GPa. As the\ntemperature is raised, the specimen with the pure epoxy\nmatrix continues curing hence its shear modulus increases\nup to 1.7 GPa, which is still lower than the shear modulus\nof the nano-fibre composite. No further curing is observed\nin the nano-fibre composite. This difference is expected\nsince in a similar temperature ramp in dynamic differential\nscanning calorimetry (DSC)24 during the curing in the\nprocessing of the same silica\u2013epoxy system, it was\nconcluded from the exotherms that the 5% silica\u2013epoxy\nsystem cured more than the pure epoxy system. Hence,\nafter the processing stage, the curing continued in the\nDMTA test for the pure epoxy\u2013fibre composite laminate\nand showed in the value of G9 until the glass transition\neffect started taking over. Overall, the higher shear\nmodulus of the fibre\u2013nanosilica\u2013epoxy composite could\nbe attributed to the locking effect of nanoparticles in the\nepoxy structure.\nIn the three point bend tests, the interlaminar shear\nstrength, ILSS, was calculated from the relation27\nILSS~\n0:75PB\nbH\n(2)\nwhere PB is the maximum load, b is the width and H is\na resin region, 200 mm away from gate; b resin region,\n700 mm away from gate; c fibres, 700 mm away from gate\n3 Images (SEM) of fracture surface: fibre\u2013silica\u2013epoxy\ncomposite produced by RTM at Vf 50.50\nLekakou et al.

Table 1 presents the results:\nthe fibre\u20135% nanosilica\u2013epoxy composite has a higher\nILSS of 6.5 MPa than the conventional fibre\u2013epoxy\ncomposite with ILSS55 MPa. The interlaminar shear\nstrength is clearly a matrix dependent property and a\nhigher Vf reduces ILSS in both types of composites.\nConclusions\nRheology DMTA tests in this study and DSC tests in\na previous study24 showed that silica nanoparticles\npromote the curing of epoxies and accelerate gelling.\nAs a result, the mixture needs to be processed at lower\ntemperatures in liquid composite moulding processes to\nextend the infiltration time.\nTwo liquid composite moulding techniques, RTM\nand RIFT, were tried in the processing of glass fibre\nwoven fabric\u2013epoxy composites with 5% nanoaggregates\nof silica nanoparticles. Infiltration stopped at very short\ninfiltration length in RTM at room temperature without\nany premature gelling. Scanning electron microscopy\nstudies of specimens at the gate and a little further away\nfrom the gate revealed that the fibre reinforcement at\nVf50.50 filtered the nanoaggregates of silica nanopar-\nticles resulting in \u2018cake\u2019 formation in the reinforcement\nat the gate, which stopped the resin flow.\nFibre\u20135 wt-% silica\u2013epoxy nanocomposites were pro-\nduced successfully by RIFT at Vf50.41\u20130.42.
