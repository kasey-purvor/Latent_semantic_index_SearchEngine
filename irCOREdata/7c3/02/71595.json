The Aharonov-Bohm effect is of the former\nclass, while weak localization (WL) and universal con-\nductance fluctuations (UCF) are of the latter class [1,2]. It\nis easy enough to understand the difference: on the one\nhand, Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the magnetocon-\nductance of a ring require phase coherence for a certain\nminimal time tmin (the time it takes to circulate once\nalong the ring), which becomes exponentially improbable\nif \u0001\u0002 < tmin. On the other hand, WL and UCF in a dis-\nordered quantum dot originate from multiple scattering\non a broad range of time scales, not limited from below,\nand the superposition of exponents with a range of decay\nrates amounts to a power law decay.\nIn a seminal paper [3], Aleiner and Larkin have ar-\ngued that ballistic chaotic quantum dots are in a class of\ntheir own. In these systems the Ehrenfest time \u0001E intro-\nduces a lower limiting time scale for the interference\neffects, which are exponentially suppressed if \u0001\u0002 < \u0001E.\nThe physical picture is that electron wave packets in a\nchaotic system can be described by a single classical\ntrajectory for a time up to \u0001E [4]. Both WL and UCF,\nhowever, require that a wave packet splits into partial\nwaves which follow different trajectories before interfer-\ning. Only the fraction exp\u0002\u0004\u0001E=\u0001\u0002\u0003 of electrons which\nhave not yet dephased at time \u0001E can therefore contribute\nto WL and UCF.\nThe WL correction \u0007G \u0005 hGi \u0004Gcl is the deviation of\nthe ensemble averaged conductance hGi (in zero magnetic\nfield) from the classical value Gcl \u0005 N=2. (We measure\nconductances in units of 2e2=h and assume an equal\nnumber of modes N \b 1 in the two leads that connect\nthe quantum dot to electron reservoirs.)

Similarly, RMT predicts for the UCF a power law\nsuppression \/ \u0002\u0001\u0002=\u0001D\u00032 of the mean-squared sample-to-\nsample conductance fluctuations [5,6],\nVarGRMT \u0005 18\u000e \u00021\t \u0001D=\u0001\u0002\u0003\n\u00042; (2)\nwith \u000e \u0005 2 \u00021\u0003 in the presence (absence) of a time-\nreversal symmetry-breaking magnetic field.\nAleiner and Larkin have calculated the \u0001E dependence\nof the WL correction, with the result [3]\n\u0007G \u0005 e\u0004\u0001E=\u0001\u0002e\u00042\u0001E=\u0001D\u0007GRMT: (3)\nThe two exponential suppression factors in Eq. (3) result\nfrom the absence of interfering trajectories for times\nbelow \u0001E. The first factor exp\u0002\u0004\u0001E=\u0001\u0002\u0003 accounts for the\nloss by dephasing and the second factor exp\u0002\u00042\u0001E=\u0001D\u0003\naccounts for the loss by escape into one of the two leads.\nThe UCF are expected to be suppressed similarly.\nThe physical picture presented by Aleiner and Larkin\nis simple and supported by two independent calculations\n[3,7]. And yet, it has been questioned as a result of some\nvery recent computer simulations of UCF [8,9] and WL\n[10] in the absence of dephasing. The expected exponen-\ntial reduction of quantum interference effects due to\nescape into the leads was not observed. In fact, both\nWL and UCF were found to be completely independent\nof \u0001E, even though the simulations extended to system\nsizes for which \u0001E was well above \u0001D. To explain these2004 The American Physical Society 186806-1\nVOLUME 93, NUMBER 18 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S\nweek ending\n29 OCTOBER 2004negative results, Jacquod and Sukhorukov [8] invoked the\neffective RMT of Silvestrov et al. [11]. In that approach,\nthe electrons with dwell times>\u0001E are described by RMT\nwith an effective number Neff \u0005 N exp\u0002\u0004\u0001E=\u0001D\u0003 of\nmodes. Then no \u0001Edependence is expected as long as\nNeff \b 1\u2014even if \u0001E \b \u0001D.\nSince the predicted exponential reduction factor due to\nescape into the leads has not appeared in the simulations,\nit is natural to ask about the factor \/ exp\u0002\u0004\u0001E=\u0001\u0002\u0003 due to\ndephasing. Does it exist? An experimental study of two-\ndimensional (2D) weak localization has concluded that it\ndoes [12], but since leads play no role in 2D, these experi-\nments cannot really resolve the issue. In the absence of\nexperiments on the zero-dimensional geometry of a quan-\ntum dot, we have used computer simulations to provide an\nanswer. We find that a relatively small amount of dephas-\ning is sufficient to introduce a marked \u0001E dependence of\nthe UCF. Our observation can be explained by incorpo-\nrating dephasing into the effective RMT. We find that\n\u0007G \u0005 e\u0004\u0001E=\u0001\u0002\u0007GRMT; (4)\nVarG \u0005 e\u00042\u0001E=\u0001\u0002VarGRMT; (5)\nand show that Eq. (5) provides a fitting-parameter-free\ndescription of the numerical data.\nWe have introduced a dephasing lead [13] in the kicked\nrotator, which is the same dynamical system studied in\nRefs. [8\u201310,14] in the absence of dephasing. The kicked\nrotator provides a stroboscopic description of chaotic\nscattering in a quantum dot [15], in the sense that the\nwave function is determined only at times that are multi-\nples of a time \u00010 (which we set to unity). The mean dwell\ntime \u0001D \u0005 M=2N \u0005 \u0012=N\u0013 is the ratio of the dimension\nM of the Floquet matrix (corresponding to a mean level\nspacing \u0013 \u0005 2\u0012=M) and the dimension 2N of the scat-\ntering matrix (without the dephasing lead). The kicking\nstrength K \u0005 7:5 determines the Lyapunov exponent \u0015 \u0005\nln\u0002K=2\u0003 \u0005 1:32. The Ehrenfest time is given by [16,17]\n\u0001E \u0005\n\u0001\n\u0015\u00041ln\u0002N2=M\u0003 if N > \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002M;p\n0 if N <\n\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\nM:\np (6)\nThe dephasing lead increases the dimension of the\nscattering matrix S to M\u000bM. It has the block form\nS \u0005\ns00 s01 s02\ns10 s11 s12\ns20 s21 s22\n0\n@\n1\nA; (7)\nwhere the subscripts 1; 2 label the two real leads and 0\nlabels the dephasing lead. The two real N-mode leads are\ncoupled ballistically to the system, while the remaining\nM\u0004 2N modes are coupled via a tunnel barrier. The\ndephasing rate 1=\u0001\u0002 \u0005 \u0019\u00021\u0004 2N=M\u0003 is proportional to\nthe tunnel probability \u0019 per mode. The dephasing lead is\nconnected to an electron reservoir at a voltage which is186806-2adjusted so that no current is drawn. The conductance G is\nthen determined by the coefficients Gij \u0005 Trsijsyij\nthrough Bu\u00a8ttiker\u2019s formula [13],\nG \u0005 G12 \t G10G02G10 \tG20\n\u0005 G12 \t \u0002N \u0004G11 \u0004G12\u0003\u0002N \u0004G22 \u0004G12\u00032N \u0004G11 \u0004G12 \u0004G22 \u0004G21 : (8)\nFor \u0019\r 1, the dephasing lead model is equivalent to\nthe imaginary energy model of dephasing [5], which is\nthe model used by Aleiner and Larkin [3]. (We will also\nmake use of this equivalent representation later on.) There\nexist other models of dephasing in quantum transport\n[18,19], but for a comparison with Ref. [3], our choice\nseems most appropriate.\nSince we need a relatively small Lyapunov exponent in\norder to reach a large enough Ehrenfest time, our simu-\nlations are sensitive to short nonergodic trajectories.\nThese introduce an undesired dependence of the data on\nthe position of the leads. Preliminary investigations in-\ndicated that UCF in a magnetic field was least sensitive to\nthe lead positions, so we concentrate on that quantum\ninterference effect in the numerics. The variance VarG\nof the conductance was calculated in an ensemble created\nby sampling 40 values of the quasienergy. To determine\nthe dependence on the lead positions, we repeated the\ncalculation for 40 different configurations of the leads.\nError bars in the plots give the spread of the data.\nThere are four time scales in the problem: \u0015\u00041, \u0001D, \u0001\u0002,\nand \u0001E. To isolate the \u0001E dependence we increase both M\nand N at constant ratio M=N and fixed K;\u0019. Then only \u0001E\nvaries. Results are shown in Fig. 1. The variance of the\nconductance is divided by the RMT prediction (2), with\n\u000e \u0005 2 because of broken time-reversal symmetry [20].\nWe see that for \u0001\u0002 \b \u0001E, there is no systematic depen-\ndence of UCF on the Ehrenfest time, consistent with\nRefs. [8,9]. However, an unambiguous \u0001E dependence\nappears for \u0001\u0002 & \u0001E, regardless of whether \u0001\u0002 is smaller\nor larger than \u0001D.\nTo explain the data in Fig. 1 we introduce dephasing\ninto the effective RMT. For that purpose, it is more\nconvenient to use an imaginary energy than a dephasing\nlead, so we first make the connection between these two\nequivalent representations. There exists an exact corre-\nspondence for anyN [5], which requires a reinjection step\nto ensure current conservation. For the case N \b 1 of\ninterest here, there is a simpler way.\nThe coefficients Gij \u0005 Gclij \tGqij in Eq. (8) consist of a\nclassical contribution Gclij of order N plus a (sample spe-\ncific) quantum correction Gqij of order unity.

The matrix\nSRMT has the RMT statistics of a fictitious chaotic cavity\nwith zero Ehrenfest time, Neff modes in each lead, and\nthe same mean dwell time \u0001D as the real cavity (see\nFig. 2). For real energy the phase factor exp\u0002iE\u0001E= \u001bh\u0003 is\nirrelevant, hence all \u0001E dependence is hidden in Neff and\n\u0013eff . Since \u0007G and VarG are independent of these two pa-\nrameters, they are also independent of \u0001E. The imaginary\npart i \u001bh=2\u0001\u0002 of the energy that represents the dephas-\ning introduces a \u0001E dependence of Gq\/ exp\u0002\u0004\u0001E=\u0001\u0002\u0003.\nInsertion of this factor into Eqs.

According to Eq. (5), this should be a plot of \u0001E\nversus ln\u0002N2=M\u0003, which in view of Eq. (6) is a straight\nline with slope 1=\u0015 \u0005 0:76.

We have identified the absence of\ndephasing in the simulations as the origin of the differ-\nence. By introducing dephasing into the simulation, we\nrecover the exponential \u0001E=\u0001\u0002 suppression factor pre-\ndicted by Aleiner and Larkin [3]. The effective RMT\nexplains why this suppression factor is observed while\nthe exponential \u0001E=\u0001D suppression factor of Eq. (3) is not.\nIt remains an outstanding theoretical challenge to pro-\nvide a microscopic foundation for the effective RMT, or\nalternatively, to derive Eqs. (4) and (5) from the quasi-\nclassical theory of Refs. [3,7]. One might think that\ndiffraction of a wave packet at the point contacts is the\nkey ingredient that is presently missing from quasiclas-\nsics and which would eliminate the exponential \u0001E=\u0001D\nsuppression factor from Eq. (3). However, our observation\nof an exponential \u0001E=\u0001\u0002 suppression factor suggests\notherwise: if diffraction at the edge of the point contacts\nwere the dominant mechanisms by which wave packets\nare split into partial waves, then the characteristic time\nscale for the suppression of quantum interference by\ndephasing would not be different from the mean dwell\ntime \u0001D.186806-4This work is part of the research program of the Dutch\nScience Foundation NWO\/FOM.
