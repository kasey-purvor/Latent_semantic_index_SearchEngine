INTRODUCTION\nMicrofluidic devices for the manipulation of complex biological fluids are\nattracting considerable interest because of their potential to be applied in\nmedical diagnostics (T\u00fcdos et al., 2001) in the form of hand held Point of\nCare (POC) devices. Blood is a biological fluid of particular interest because\nit contains a number of different biomarkers that can provide valuable\ninformation on the health of the patients. These include for example the\ncardiac marker for heart diseases B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (Gardner\net al., 2006) and the protein S100B for the early detection of stroke (Hill\n2005).\nPolymer microfluidic devices are suitable candidates for POC devices\nbecause they can be manufactured in high volume at an affordable cost using\nmicroreplication technologies such as hot-embossing or micro-injection\nmoulding (Marson et al., 2007). Both these technologies require a mould (or\nmaster) being manufactured onto which the polymer is then replicated. The\nmould is normally fabricated out of hard metals such as steel by a variety of\nmetal microfabrication technologies. The quality of the manufactured\nchannels in terms of surface finish depends on the choice of the\nmanufacturing technique and on the control of the manufacturing process.\nIt is well known that blood is a non-Newtonian liquid and when blood is\nrunning through tubes and vessels a cell-free layer exists near the walls\n(Merrill et al. 1963). The thickness of the cell-free layer increases with\ndecreasing diameter for diameters between 50\u00b5m and 300\u00b5m (Fig. 4). It is\nalso known from a number of previous studies, that the thickness and the\nviscosity of this layer with very low cell concentration is dependent on the\nparticle size, the channel diameter and the haematocrit value (Sharan and\nPopel 2001).\nFor Newtonian liquids, Wang H. and Wang Y. (Wang and Wang 2007)\nreported that the higher the wall roughness the greater the velocity gradient at\nthe channel wall. At a Reynolds number above 100 and a relative roughness\n(\u03b5) larger than 10%, flow separation occurs and regular perturbation methods,\nwhich are typically used to predict fluid flow in a microchannel, cannot be\nused any more. The effect of high roughness (RZ) walls (Hodes et al., 2006)\nor hydrophobic surfaces (Choi et al., 2002) is better described with the Navier\nslip boundary model. Thus, the velocity of the bulk liquid flowing in a rough\nchannel rises in comparison to that in a smooth channel. However, it is still\nunclear what influence a rough wall has on non-Newtonian liquids such as\nwhole blood. This paper focuses on quantifying this influence in view of the\nchoice of a suitable manufacturing process for metal micro-moulds for the\nmanufacture of polymer microfluidic devices for blood manipulation.\n2. MATERIAL AND METHODS\nThe viscosity of blood is variable and it is not possible to measure it within a\nchannel directly. Thus, the viscosity has to be measured by calculating the\n3volume flow and the differential pressure. To be able to measure these values,\nthey must be kept constant over a certain time at a constant temperature.\nTherefore, in the experiments to be described, the volume flow was driven\nwith a peristaltic pump (Minipuls3, Model M312 from Gilson Inc.), and the\ndifferential pressure was measured with pressure sensors (HCXPM005D6V,\nHCXM100D6V and HCX005D6V from Sensortechnics). The readout of the\nsensors was carried out via a LabView 8.5 program connected to an A\/D\nconverter (LabJack U3 High Voltage A\/D). Using this signal the pump speed\nhas been controlled via a closed loop-control back over the A\/D converter.\nThe volume flow was measured by monitoring the increase in outflow blood\nweight (Mettler balance AT460) over a period of 10 minutes.\nAll experiments were performed in a temperature-controlled laboratory at\n21\u00b11\u02daC and all measurements for water (used as a reference) and whole blood\nwere repeated two or three times to check the repeatability.\nWhole horse blood was obtained from TCS Biosciences Ltd. (HB035). It was\ndelivered already defibrinated but, in addition, 6g\/l of trisodium citrate was\nadded to prevent its coagulation.\nTo magnify the effects of the inner walls on the flow, the wall surface was\nmade as large as possible, while keeping the velocity profile along the\nmicrochannel constant. Therefore both channels (rough and smooth) have\nbeen built as rectangular conduits (Lima, 2008) with a constant width and\nlength of 10mm and with channel heights of 50 and 100\u00b5m respectively (Fig.\n1). For comparison, at least two different channel heights with two different\nroughnesses were measured at three differential pressures (200, 300 and\n400Pa for the 100\u00b5m channel and 1000, 3000, 5000Pa for the 50\u00b5m channel).\nThe appropriate pressure range was selected to maintain comparable flow\nvelocities for both the 50 and the 100\u00b5m channels.\nFor additional comparisons, a three-dimensional computational model of the\ndevice was created using commercial software (Gambit), and then FLUENT\n6.3 was used to undertake the flow calculations. The model was meshed with\n700,000 cells and all wall boundaries were treated as solid with a no slip\ncondition. A velocity inflow configuration was chosen for the inlet and an\noutflow condition was used at the outlet.\nA polycarbonate (PC) polymer sheet (Makrolon\u00ae GP clear 099) was selected\nfor the test device. The depth of the channel was created by inserting a\npolyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheet (Polymex\u00ae) of the desired thickness\nbetween two 10mm thick PC sheets and fixed in position by super glue after\nclamping.\nThe device cavities, inlets and outlets were machined on a Kern Evo\nMicromachining Centre.\nThe \u201crough\u201d surface (Rz = 1.8 \u00b10.6\uf06dm) was generated by micromilling using\nthe Kern Evo with a 1.5mm endmill. The spindle speed was 10,000rpm and\nthe feed rate was 750mm\/min.\nThe \u201csmooth\u201d surface was the native PC sheet (Makrolon\u00ae, Bayer) as\nreceived from the supplier. The measured roughness was Rz = 57 \u00b12nm.\nThe total thickness of each device was measured directly by a micrometer\nwith an accuracy of about 1\u00b5m. From this measurement it was possible to\ncalculate the actual depth of the microfluidic channels.\nThe roughness measurements were carried out with a Taylor Hobson Form\nTalysurf 120L and afterwards calculated by a Scilab program. Three\nroughness measurements on three different regions were made on the rough\n4surface and one on the smooth surface for comparison.\n3. DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS\nThe aim of the work is to measure a change of volume flow (or viscosity) by\nchanging the inner surface roughness of the channel (Fig. 1) while keeping all\nthe other parameters constant. The Hagen-Poiseuille equation (1) describes\nthe change of volume flow (IV), related to the differential pressure (\u0394P), \nviscosity (\u03b7), hydraulic diameter (dh), cross-sectional area of channel (A), and\nlength (l) (Tipler and Mosca 2004).\nl\u03b7\n\u0394PdA\n=\nt\nV\n=I hV \uf0d7\uf0d7\n\uf0d7\uf0d7\n32\n2\n(1)\nFor a rectangular channel with the height (h) << width (w) of the channel and\nwith l \u2248 w, equation 1 can be simplified to equation 2 as follows:\nVI\n\u0394Ph\u03b7\n8\n3\n\uf0bb ; with dh = 2 h (2)\nEquation 2 was used in this work to calculate the apparent viscosity (\u03b7) by\nmeasuring the volume flow through the channel and the differential pressure\nbetween the inlet and the outlet at a known channel height. This experiment\nwas repeated with two different wall roughnesses to compare the results with\neach other and to search for differences.\n4. RESULTS\nFigure 2 shows a 2D velocity slice for the 10\u00d710mm microchannel. A\nlaminar flow is clearly seen since the velocity vectors are parallel to each\nother with the same value of 10mm\/s across the whole width (equal velocities\nat the channel exit are depicted in green in Figure 2).\nThe results from the ANSYS simulation show that the fluid flow conditions\nalong the whole channel are constant; therefore the effects at the walls can be\ncompared. Turbulences have unpredictable influences on the viscosity and\ntherefore must be avoided. Interestingly, the predicted laminar flow\ncharacteristics have been illustrated by the presence of a separation of the\nflow in Figure 3 below, which traces a route across the experimental device\naligned with the modelled velocity vectors. It is likely that such an\nunintentional feature has been caused by agglutination of blood components\n(cells and\/or protein) at the edge of the flow inlet.\nThe experiments carried out on water showed that the calculated volume flow\nin the rough channel was significantly higher than for the smooth one. In\nparticular, the apparent viscosity of water in the rough channels dropped to\n58.1 \u00b17.8% and to 79.3 \u00b17.9% (where 100% represented the viscosity of\nwater in the smooth channel) in the 57\u00b5m and 109\u00b5m deep channels\nrespectively (Table 1). This suggests a decrease in the flow resistance and a\ndecrease in the apparent viscosity that is in distinct contrast to the predictions\nmade by previous simulations (Kulkarni, 2004).\n5TABLE 1\nCOMPARISON OF THE APPARENT VISCOSITY OF WATER AND WHOLE HORSE\nBLOOD IN A ROUGH (Rz = 1.8\u00b5m) VERSUS A SMOOTH (Rz = 60nm) CHANNEL\n(100%).

The blood with\nhaematocrit value of 42 % (sample 2) showed a drop in the apparent viscosity\nof 51.6 \u00b12.7% in the 57\u00b5m channel and of 77.4 \u00b1 3.7% in the 109\u00b5m channel\n(Table 1).\nThe Reynolds numbers (Re) for the experiments mentioned above were\ncalculated using the equation:\n\uf068\n\uf072 vdh \uf0d7\uf0d7\uf03dRe (3)\nWhere dh=2h and h is the channel depth, \u03c1 the density of blood (1060kg\/m\u00b3),\n\uf06e the velocity and \u03b7 the viscosity. The calculated Re values are reported in\nTable 2 together with the fluid velocity and the apparent viscosity calculated\nusing equation 2.\nIt was observed that in all cases the Re for the rough channels was higher than\nthe one for the smooth channels. This result indicates that an increase of\nsurface roughness Rz from 60nm to 1.8\uf06dm lowers the apparent viscosity of\nthe blood dramatically, probably due to the presence of boundary effects.\nFurthermore the roughness seems to influence both water and whole blood\nalmost equally.\n6TABLE 2\nREYNOLDS NUMBER (Re), VELOCITY (v) AND VISCOSITY (\u03b7) FOR WHOLE\nHORSE BLOOD (SAMPLE 1).

DISCUSSION\nThe results of the experiments showed a significant change of the apparent\nviscosity of both water and whole horse blood when comparing rough and\nsmooth surfaces. These effects have already been observed (Hodes et al.,\n2006, Cohen and Feaster, 2007) but never been compared directly.\nA direct comparison was carried out in this work and as a result it can be\nstated that water and blood flows are very similar with respect to the change\nin apparent viscosity within microchannels. This can be explained if we\nassume that the Newtonian cell-free layer which surrounds the central stream\n7of the blood is the only portion of blood that is affected by the surface\nroughness. This assumption is supported by the observation that a decrease in\nhaematocrit, which will increase the thickness of the cell-free layer, seems to\nincrease the influence of the wall roughness (Table 1). Furthermore the\ninfluence of the channel roughness becomes less important with deeper\nchannels (Table 2) (larger hydraulic diameters). It is known that in deeper\nchannels (above 50\u00b5m) the cell-free layer is smaller (Fig. 4) and in the whole\nchannel, the area cross-section for volume flow becomes larger (Sharan and\nPopel, 2001).\nThe reason for this effect may be a decrease in the no-slip boundary effect in\nsmaller channels, enabling the plasma at the wall to flow with a velocity\nsignificantly higher than zero. Moreover the blood flow velocity is also\ndependent on the peak-to-valley roughness of the walls. For example Cohen\nand Feaster (Cohen and Feaster, 2007) predicted a quicker fill time of at least\n25% up to more than 50% for microchannels with roughened walls compared\nto smooth channels. Thus there has to be a limit where the roughness will\nincrease flow resistance and beyond which it will decrease as modeled in the\nsimulations of Wang and Wang (Wang and Wang, 2007).\nIt is important to note that the plasma layer is highly dependent on the\nerythrocyte size which is smaller for horses (5-6\uf06dm) than for humans (8-\n10\uf06dm) (Jain 1993). The results obtained in this work can therefore be only\nused to predict qualitatively the behaviour of human blood. As human\nerythrocytes are bigger than horse erythrocytes, it is expected that the plasma\nlayer will be thicker (Vand, 1948, Baskurt et al. 1997). This could result in a\nmore pronounced effect of surface roughness on human blood flow.\nThe results obtained are collated in Table 3 in the form of a set of design\nguidelines for the manufacture of blood microfluidic devices with controlled\ncell-free layer thickness and blood apparent viscosity.\nTABLE 3\nDESIGN RULES FOR VARIABLE PARAMETERS THAT INFLUENCE THE\nAPPARENT VISCOSITY AND PLASMA LAYER OF BLOOD\nVariable parameters Parameters influenced\nHaematocrit Roughness (Rz) Channel depth Pressure\/ velocity Apparent viscosity Plasma layer\n42 % 1.8 \u00b5m 50 \u00b5m high low thick\n44 % 60 nm 100 \u00b5m low high thin\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nThe aim of this work was to analyse the blood flow behaviour in\nmicrochannels with variations in wall surface roughness. Special attention\nwas paid to micromilled surfaces for applications in micromoulding.\nThe results of the experiments showed a significant drop in the apparent\nviscosity in the rough-surfaced microchannel compared to the smooth one.\nThis effect seemed to increase with a smaller channel depth and with lower\nerythrocyte concentration (or haematocrit value). A low haematocrit value\ncorresponds to a thick cell-free layer (Fig. 4); therefore it is possible to state\nthat the effect of the rough surface on the apparent viscosity increases with\nthe cell-free layer thickness.\n8ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nD.M.A. wishes to thank EPSRC for Grand Challenge grant EP\/C534212\/1 to research \u201cThe\ndesign and manufacture of 3D-miniaturised integrated products\u201d (\u201c3D-Mintegration\u201d).\nS.P. wishes to thank Kaiserslautern University of Applied Sciences for funding to carry out\nhis research at Cranfield University.\nREFERENCES\nBaskurt O.K., Farley R.A. and Meiselman H.J.
