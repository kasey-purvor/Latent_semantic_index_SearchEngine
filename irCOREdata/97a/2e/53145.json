Introduction\nThe coast plays amajor role in the culture and economy\nof theUnited Kingdom, which has the longest coastline in\nthe European Union. Concern about climate change ef-\nfects on this national asset motivated the production of\nthe government-funded United Kingdom Climate Im-\npacts Programme report \u2018\u2018UK Climate Projections 2009\nmarine scenarios\u2019\u2019 [henceforth UKCP09 (Marine); Lowe\net al. 2009).\nIn a shallow well-mixed sea, the surface wind stress can\nbe considered to act by accelerating the full depth of the\nwater column; thus, to a first approximation, the shal-\nlower the water, the greater the effect of wind stress.\nThus, the southeast coast of England is prone to flooding\nby storm surge owing to its location near the almost-closed\nsouthern end of the shallowNorth Sea. TheRiver Thames\nis tidal all through central London, and thus the Thames\nestuary is a particular hot spot of coastal flooding sensi-\ntivity. Of an estimated \u00a3150 billion (230 billion U.S. dol-\nlars) assets at risk from coastal flooding in the United\nKingdom, half are located on this estuary. This is the mo-\ntive that provided the greater part of our funding, through\nthe U.K. Environment Agency\u2019s Thames Estuary 2100\nproject (TE2100 2010), which seeks to provide a flood risk\nmanagement plan for the Thames out to the end of the\ntwenty-first century. Thus, our particular focus here is on\nthe results of regionalized climate modeling studies of this\nkey location.\nSome of the work presented here augments the work\nreported in Howard et al. (2008). Our objectives are\nthreefold. First, we investigate the relationship between\nCorresponding author address:TomHoward,Met OfficeHadley\nCentre, FitzRoy Road, Exeter EX1 3PB, United Kingdom.\nE-mail: tom.howard@metoffice.gov.uk\n6234 JOURNAL OF CL IMATE VOLUME 23\nDOI: 10.1175\/2010JCLI3520.1\nsurges modeled in the southern North Sea and particu-\nlarly at the Thames estuary with and without the atmo-\nspheric downscaling step provided by a regional climate\nmodel (RCM). This issue is not discussed in either of the\nreports mentioned above. Second, we investigate the in-\nfluence of the tide\u2013surge phase relationship on surface\nelevation at this location. This augments the results pre-\nsented in Howard et al. (2008). Last, we consider the as-\nsumption thatmean sea level change can be added linearly\nto changes in surge climate for this location. This also\naugments the results presented in Howard et al. (2008).\n2. Climate modeling system and experiments\nThe third climate configuration of the Met Office Uni-\nfied Model (HadCM3; Gordon et al. 2000; Pope et al.\n2000) is a general circulation model that has previously\nbeen shown to have considerable skill at simulating the\nglobal climate (e.g., Stott et al. 2000). The atmosphere\nmodel has 19 levels in the vertical and a horizontal reso-\nlution of 2.58 3 3.758. The ocean model has 20 vertical\nlevels and a horizontal resolution of 1.258 3 1.258. Pro-\ncesses at scales smaller than the grid size are usually pa-\nrameterized, that is, represented by simple relationships\nbetween the large scales and these smaller scales. The\nparameters in these relationships are often not precisely\nknown, and the model can be run with a range of param-\neter values and still credibly reproduce observed climate.\nTo estimate uncertainty in projections of the future, we\ncan run these plausible model versions beyond present\nday and examine the spread of the results (Murphy et al.\n2007; Collins et al. 2006). This approach of taking a single\nmodel structure and varying themodel parameters within\nthat structure we refer to as the perturbed physics en-\nsemble (PPE).\nThe resolution of HadCM3 is not sufficient to pro-\nvide the regional impact studies of climate change that\nare reported in UKCP09 (Murphy et al. 2009), so the\nglobal climate model PPE is used to provide atmo-\nspheric boundary conditions for a one-way nested regional\natmospheric climate model, the Hadley Centre Regional\nModel, version 3 (HadRM3; see Murphy et al. 2007),\nwhich is set up to simulate climate over Europe in more\ndetail.\nThe global coupled climate model ensemble (PPE) of\n17 members was set up to simulate the changing climate\nfrom 1860 to 2100. First, the global model ensemble\nmembers were spun up to a perpetual 1860-like climate.\nDuring the long spin-up stage (hundreds of years), the\nocean heat distribution comes into balance with the sur-\nface fluxes, so that any signal seen in the next stage can be\nattributed to forcing (rather than model drift due to on-\ngoing transient changes in the ocean heat distribution).\nFrom 1860 to 2000, the applied greenhouse gas concen-\ntrations were based on observations, and from 2000 to\n2100 they were based on the Special Report on Emissions\nScenario A1B (Nakicenovic and Swart 2000). The cli-\nmate model includes a sulfate aerosol model; the level\nof sulfate emissions is also based on the A1B scenario.\nThe regional atmospheric model ensemble was used to\ndownscale the global transient results for the period 1950\u2013\n2100 (for further details, seeMurphy et al. 2009, chapter 3).\nOnly 11 of the 17 regional atmospheric model ensemble\nmembers were selected to drive the surge model to pro-\nvide the surge projections for TE2100 (Howard et al.\n2008) and UKCP09 (Marine; Lowe et al. 2009). The\nother six RCM simulations were found to be deficient\nin their simulations of storms, and this was traced to the\ninfluence of a parameter perturbation that did not scale\nsatisfactorily between the GCM and RCM simulations.\nFull details of this can be found in Murphy et al. (2009,\nchapter 3).\nThe domain of the RCM is chosen with the aim of\nsatisfying two conditions (Jones et al. 1995): 1) that the\nRCM circulation is constrained to stay close to the\ndriving GCM on scales that are skillfully resolved by\nthe GCM and 2) that at finer scales the development of\nfeatures in the RCM is not damped or distorted by the\nlateral boundary forcing. Hourly winds and surface\npressure from HadRM3 are used to drive the Proudman\nOceanographic Laboratory 12-km depth-averaged storm\nsurge model of the continental shelf (POLCS3).\nImplicit in this approach is the requirement that the\nphysical link between large-scale climate processes and\nsmall-scale effects is strong. That this requirement is\nfulfilled in practice, at least for \u2018\u2018well flushed\u2019\u2019 (Weisse\nand von Storch 2009) regions, such as northwest Europe,\nhas been demonstrated by Denis et al. (2002). A second\nimplicit assumption is that the feedback from the small\nto large scale is important only in its long-term statistics\nrather than hour by hour, since only the long-term sta-\ntistics can be represented by the parameterizations in the\nglobal model.\nAn alternative to this \u2018\u2018dynamical downscaling\u2019\u2019 ap-\nproach is statistical downscaling (see, e.g., van der Linden\nandMitchell 2009; Weisse and von Storch 2009; Haylock\net al. 2006), which aims to provide local detail based\non statistical relationships between the large-scale cli-\nmate and local effects. We investigate this alternative\nfor our particular problem of storm surge modeling in\nsection 5a.\nEffect of spatial resolution of the atmospheric model\nThe surge trend results projected in TE2100 (Howard\net al. 2008) and in UKCP09 (Marine) (Lowe et al. 2009)\nare based on the POL CS3 12-km surge model driven by\n1 DECEMBER 2010 HOWARD ET AL . 6235\na 25-km regional atmospheric climatemodel, which in turn\nis driven by a coupled global climatemodel with a grid size\nof approximately 2.58 3 3.758, as described above.\nIt is of interest to knowwhether useful surge projections\ncould have been made without the use of the regional\nmodel for three reasons: first, because running a regional\nclimate model is expensive; second, because of the ap-\npeal of simplicity and the exclusion of unnecessary detail;\nand third, because there exist many other global climate\nmodel simulations that are not downscaledwith a regional\nmodel, but which could, in principle, be used to drive\na surge model directly if the regional model downscaling\nstep could be shown to be unnecessary for the location of\ninterest. With our simulation using both global and re-\ngional models, we are privileged to be able to address this\nquestion to inform future work on surge modeling for the\nThames estuary. Sterl et al. (2009) use global climate\nmodel data to force a surge model of the North Sea. In\ndiscussing this they say,\n. . . water level is the integral result of the forcing over\nthe whole North Sea. We therefore anticipated that the\nwater level is primarily determined by the large-scale\npressure and wind fields, which are well-represented in\nglobal models, and that the fine structure of the wind field\nis only important for individual cases, but not for the\nlong-term statistics.\nWe investigated this assumption in our model by\nforcing the surge model again, this time with 10-m wind\nand sea level pressure data taken directly from the global\nclimate model. In both the global and regional cases, we\nused data taken from the driving models once per model\nhour, with no averaging performed.\nWe know that small differences in timing of a meteo-\nrological event relative to the astronomical tide can lead\nto large differences in surge when tidal interaction is in-\ncluded (see section 5c, particularly Fig. 10).We anticipate\nsome differences in the timing of meteorological events\nbetween the global and regional models given that the\nregional model is correctly setup. So as not to be exces-\nsively constrained by its boundaries (as discussed above)\nand to study the effect on surge of changing from regional\nto global forcing separately from the effects on the tide of\nchanges in meteorological timing, we performed both\nsimulations with the surge model in \u2018\u2018surge only\u2019\u2019 mode\n(i.e., without any tidal forcing). Thus, in section 5a, the\nword \u2018\u2018surge\u2019\u2019 is unambiguous: it refers to the modeled\nwater elevation in the absence of the tide.\n3. Surge modeling system\nPOL CS3 is used operationally to provide coastal\nfloodwarning in theUnitedKingdomunder the auspices\nof UK Coastal Monitoring and Forecasting. The model\nproduces a numerical solution of the discretized non-\nlinear shallowwater equations with friction, and a lower-\nresolution version is described in detail by Flather (1976),\nWilliams and Flather (2000), and Flather and Williams\n(2004). Validation of the operational model is performed\nmonthly by comparisonwith observed sea level data from\nthe U.K. National Tide Gauge Network and an annual\nsummary of performance is published (UKCMF 2009).\nThe operational model has been shown to perform par-\nticularly well during extreme storm surges in the south-\nern North Sea (Horsburgh et al. 2008). Here we have\na different arrangement: the surge model is driven by\na climate model instead of an operational weather\nforecasting model or reanalyzed data. So, indepen-\ndent validation of this different arrangement was made\nagainst observations. The results of this validation\nare reported in Howard et al. (2008) and Lowe et al.\n(2009).\nThe tide\u2013surge model covers the entire northwestern\nEuropean continental shelf, as shown in Fig. 1. Tidal\ninput at the model open boundaries consists of the 26\nlargest constituents. Modeled surges are derived by\nsubtracting a tidal model simulation from one forced by\nboth gravitational tide (applied as a forcing at the surge\nmodel boundaries) and atmospheric forcing from the\nregional climate model. Surge lateral boundary condi-\ntions are applied by adding the so-called inverse ba-\nrometer effect to the gravitational tide level at lateral\nboundaries.\nThe model of the relationship between near-surface\nwind speed vector (taken from the atmospheric model)\nand surface wind stress vector t (applied to the coastal\nshelf model) is based on the formulation suggested by\nCharnock (1955) and can be described by an implicit\nequation:\n1\nC\nd\n5\n1\nk\nlog\ng z\nbC\nd\nU2\n\" #2,\n(1)\nwhich is solved iteratively for the drag coefficient Cd,\nwhere\nt5C\nd\n.\na\nUU; (2)\nU is the wind vector at height z above the sea surface;\nU 5 jUj is the wind speed at height z above the sea sur-\nface; g is the acceleration due to gravity; k is vonKa\u00b4rma\u00b4n\u2019s\nconstant (taken to be 0.41); .a is the density of air at\nmean sea level; and b, chosen by tuning the operational\nsurge model for optimal surge results, is 0.0275; z is al-\nways 10 m in this work.\n6236 JOURNAL OF CL IMATE VOLUME 23\n4. The use of skew surge as a diagnostic\nIn the simulations used to create the projections given\nin TE2100 (Howard et al. 2008) and UKCP09 (Marine;\nLowe et al. 2009), the surge model is run with meteoro-\nlogical forcing from the regional climatemodel, producing\nthe combined response to winds, surface pressure gradi-\nents, and tides. This captures the tide\u2013surge interaction,\nwhere the principal effect of the surge on the tide is to\nalter the times of high and low water and the effect of the\ntide on the surge is the modulation of surge production.\nThe model is also run in tide-only mode without any\nmeteorological forcing. One way of measuring the mete-\norological component of the sea surface elevation, then, is\nto subtract the tide-only elevation from the combined-\nresponse elevation. This difference is the nontidal re-\nsidual, which for brevity we will refer to henceforth as the\nresidual. Wind stress is most effective at generating surge\nin shallowwater.Also, the earlier arrival of the tide during\na positive surge may be associated with large but un-\nimportant residuals (Fig. 2, top panel). Thus, peak re-\nsiduals (the maximum value of the residual during the\nsurge event) are consistently obtained 3\u20135 h prior to the\npredicted high water (Horsburgh and Wilson 2007). For\nthis reason, a more significant and practical measure than\nthe peak residual is the skew surge (Fig. 2, bottom panel),\nwhich is the difference between the elevation of the pre-\ndicted astronomical high tide and the nearest experienced\nhigh water (de Vries et al. 1995).\nAn indication of the improved statistical usefulness of\nskew surge over residual is given in Fig. 3, which shows\na scatterplot of 693 modeled skew surges against tidal\nelevation at the Thames grid box for a 1-yr simulation\nand a corresponding plot for the 611 largest residuals\nfrom the same year (subject to the requirement of 12-h\nseparation between any two). There is an insignificant\ncorrelation between skew and tide (P value.90%), but\na significant negative correlation between residual and\ntide (P value ,1%). This is associated with nonlinear\ntide\u2013surge interaction (e.g., Horsburgh andWilson 2007),\nbut a simple physical interpretation is that residuals are\ngreater close to low water.\n5.

Alternatively,\nthe data could be viewed as realizations of y5 ax inwhich\nboth x and y are subject to independent, symmetrically\ndistributed random errors. In this case, each approach\n(either globally or regionally driven) would be an equally\nvalid way of simulating surges (albeit the surges are on\ndifferent scales in the global and regional simulations), with\nboth approaches having a level of noise (again, on different\nscales). Leng et al. (2007) discuss approaches to regression\nin the case where both variables are subject to error.\nFollowing their recommendations, we find geometric-\nmean regression to be appropriate for our data. Since we\nknow that in conditions of flat calm there would be no\nelevation under either forcing, it is inappropriate to allow\na nonzero intercept for the regression line.Whenwe insist\nthat the intercept be zero, the gradient of the geometric-\nmean regression line becomes\na5 sign[cov(x, y)]\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nvar(y)\nvar(x)\ns\n. (3)\nThis quantity ismapped in Fig. 4.Gradient,a, varies slowly\nwith location between 1.3 and 1.5 within the region chosen.\nThus, the modeled surges forced by the global model are\nsmaller than those forced by the regional model. To in-\nvestigate the causes of this, we compare the distribution of\nsurface wind speeds in the twomodels with each other and\nalso with data presented by Sterl et al. (2009) for a location\n(558N, 58E) over the North Sea, in Fig. 5. For ease of ref-\nerence, the location is indicated on Fig. 1. The top panel of\nFig. 5 shows that the Hadley Centre model extreme wind\nspeeds are smaller than most of the Ensemble Simulations\nof Extreme Weather Events under Nonlinear Climate\nChange (ESSENCE) and GCM extreme wind speeds\npresented by Sterl et al., but that the Hadley Centre\nRCM extreme wind speed distribution compares very\nwell with the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range\nWeather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-40) and National\nCenters for Environmental Prediction\u2013National Center\nFIG. 3.

The low\nbias in HadCM3 wind speeds at 558N, 58E, well offshore\nin the North Sea, makes an interesting contrast, not only\nwith the results of Sterl et al. (2009), but also with some\nexperiments investigating the \u2018\u2018added value\u2019\u2019 (see, e.g.,\nWeisse and von Storch 2009; Christensen et al. 2007) of\nregional climate models. Sotillo et al. (2005), Winterfeld\n(2008), and Winterfeld et al. (2010) all support the idea\nthat regional climate modeling gives added value to\nmarine near-surface winds near the coast, particularly\nwhere there is complex orography, but not over the open\nsea. In contrast we find a significant improvement at\n558N, 58E over the open sea for our regional climate\nmodel, and this is consistent with our improved regional\nclimate model surge simulations.\nWe are particularly interested in extreme positive surge\nevents and the diagnosis of trends in these from a climate-\nmodel-driven simulation. To study this we focus again on\nthe modeled elevation at the surge model grid point cor-\nresponding to the mouth of the Thames estuary. One ap-\nproach is to regress the 19 regional-model-driven annual\nmaxima at the mouth of the Thames against the corre-\nsponding 19 global-model-driven annual maxima at the\nmouth of the Thames (Fig. 6, top left panel). This is\na simple approach but the uncertainties are large. We find\nthe gradient of the fitted regression to be around 1.6 for the\nannual maxima and also for lower ranks\u2014some of which\nare shown in the other panels of Fig. 6. This is consistent\nwith the values found above for regression of the whole\ntime series at this point (see Fig. 4).\nIn every case the correlation is highly significant\n(P value less than 0.5%).\nb. Identification of trends in regionally and globally\ndriven simulations\nThe major theme of the TE2100 (Howard et al. 2008)\nand UKCP09 (Marine; Lowe et al. (2009) surge work is\nthe identification of statistically significant trends in the\nextremes of the surge distribution. Typically, signifi-\ncance is assessed by comparing the size of the estimated\ntrend in the 50-yr return level with the uncertainty in this\nestimation. Return levels and trends are determined from\nthe five largest events each year following the procedure\nadvocated by Coles (2001, chapter 6). Not surprisingly,\nno such significant trend is found in our short (19 yr)\nsimulation using either the global or the regional model.\nHowever, we can make random resamples of the 19 yr of\nsurge height projections from the globally and regionally\ndriven simulations (we make the same resampling of each\nset to preserve the global\u2013regional correspondence, since\nit is this correspondence that we wish to study). Occa-\nsionally we will happen to resample them such that the\ntrend determined from the resampled regionally driven\nsimulation will be positive and statistically significant. If\nthe resampled globally driven simulation also exhibits a\npositive trend with a similar level of significance, then we\ncan infer that we need not have performed the regional\nmodel simulation to diagnose the existence of a trend in\nthis resampled case.\nAfter examining many such random resamples, we can\nproduce a contingency table showing global versus re-\ngional diagnoses of positive, negative, or no trend. This\ntable for the 6-yr return level is shown, against a back-\nground plot of the data for 10 000 random resamples, in\nFig. 7. For each data point, each trend estimate has been\nFIG. 5. Following Sterl et al. (2009), we present Gumbel plots of\nannual maximum daily-mean wind speed at 558N, 58E. (top) Gray\nlines: ESSENCE and GCMs data from Fig. 1 in Sterl et al.

So,\nusing a 5% test level, we would diagnose, for example,\na positive trend from the globally driven simulation (x\naxis) but no trend from the regionally driven simulation\n(y axis) on 357 occasions (right-hand column, middle\nrow) out of 10 000 comparisons (3.6%). Diagnosis of\na positive trend from the globally driven simulation but\na negative trend from the regionally driven simulation\ndoes not occur in this 10 000-strong sample. The converse\noccurs only once. We studied the 6-yr return level be-\ncause the TE2100 (Howard et al. 2008) study focused on\nthe 50-yr return level; 6 yr is to our 19-yr sample what\n50 yr is to a 149-yr sample: about one-third. Owing to the\nnormalization, Fig. 7 is strongly symmetrical about the\nlines y5 x and y52x. Certainly x and y are very strongly\ncorrelated (P value much less than 0.1%).\nAs with the simpler case of the annual maxima above,\nwe seek a transfer relationship, but this time between\nthe magnitude of a trend in the globally driven simula-\ntion and the magnitude of a trend in the regionally\ndriven simulation, again using geometric-mean regres-\nsion. Again we find the gradient of the regression to be\n1.6, just as it was for the annual maxima, but this time\nwith smaller uncertainties associated with the use of\nFIG. 6.

Notice that in every case, there is good agreement between the solid and\ndashed lines.\n6240 JOURNAL OF CL IMATE VOLUME 23\nmore data: five ranks annually instead of just the annual\nmaxima. For our data this result is robust across trends\nin different return levels (Fig. 8).\nIn summary, then, we find that for our mouth of the\nThames location, our global climate model is suitable for\ndriving our surge model for the purpose of identifying\ncentury-scale changes in extreme surge climate, and our\nevidence suggests that the signal-to-noise ratio in such\ntrends will be similar whether the global or regional cli-\nmate data are used to drive the surge model.\nFurthermore, a factor of 1.6 is suitable for amplifying\nthe globally driven extreme surges to reach the scale of\nthe regionally driven extreme surges for our model and\nlocation, although other locations, other models, or other\nvalues of the Charnock parameter might require a dif-\nferent factor. This second finding makes an interesting\ncontrast to the results of Sterl et al. (2009). Their globally\ndriven surge model water levels at Hoek van Holland,\nNetherlands, are directly comparable with observations\n(Sterl et al. 2009, their Fig. 4). This contrast might be\nassociatedwith their use of a larger value of theCharnock\nparameter, which has the effect of increasing the stress on\nthe sea surface for a given wind in a one-way nested\nmodel. Sterl et al. use a Charnock parameter of 0.032; we\nuse 0.0275. Or the contrast might be associated with the\nunderprediction of wind speed (see section 5a, particu-\nlarly Fig. 5) by our GCM, or both.\nThe validation reported by Howard et al. (2008) sug-\ngests that water-level statistics at the Thames estuary\nproduced by our simulation system in regional-model-\ndriven mode are only slightly diminished compared to\nthose derived from tide\u2013gauge observations or from an\nERA-40-based (Uppala et al. 2005) surge model simu-\nlation. This suggests that for the purpose of identifying\ntrends at this location, the regional modeling step could\nbe omitted, and trends diagnosed from a globally driven\nsurge model could be scaled using observations.\nOne caveat in particular should be noted in the context\nof the regression coefficient: we ran the surge model in\nsurge-only mode, for reasons discussed in section 2a. It is\nrecognized (Horsburgh andWilson 2007; Sterl et al. 2009)\nthat the tide has a damping effect on surge, and thus this\nfigure may be modified when the effect of the tide is in-\ncluded, since we might anticipate that the damping effect\nwould be proportionately larger for the larger regional-\nmodel-driven surges.\nc. Comparison of extreme simulated surges and the\nobservational record\nAn important goal for climate-model-driven surge\nsimulations is to produce extreme storm surges that are\ncomparable in magnitude (and therefore effect) to those\nobserved. Theworst storm surge in recent history to affect\nthe coasts of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands\noccurred during the night of 31 January 1953, when\ncoastal flooding caused more than 2000 fatalities (Baxter\n2005). The skew surge at Southend-on-Sea, at the mouth\nof the Thames estuary, during this event has been esti-\nmated from archived paper records to be 2 m above\na predicted tide of 2.63 m above ordnance datum\n(G. Siggers 2007, personal communication; see acknowl-\nedgments) about 48 h after the full moon. (Ordnance\ndatum is the U.K. national standard datum of vertical\nheight, based on the mean sea level at Newlyn, Cornwall.)\nIn contrast, the largest skew surge in our entire PPE en-\nsemble simulation (which represents a total of 1639model\nyears) was 1.78 m, and this occurred during a tidal cycle\nwhere the modeled high water was 1.69 m. The synoptic\nsituation in these two events was rather similar. In both\ncases the low moved eastward to the north of the United\nKingdom and then southward approximately along the\neastern shores of theNorth Sea. Charts showingmean sea\nlevel atmospheric pressure near the time of maximum\nelevation at the mouth of the Thames for both the 1953\nevent and the largest skew event in our PPE ensemble\nsimulation are shown in Fig. 9. The similarity in these two\nsnapshots is apparent, although the gradients are larger\nin the 1953 analysis, and the low center is farther west.\nSince the passage of weather systems is independent\nof tide, it is reasonable to ask whether, with different\ntimings of storm movement relative to the state of the\ntide and the fortnightly spring-neap cycle, the model\nFIG. 7.

It is possible to\nachieve this synthetically by deliberately phase shift-\ning the tide with respect to the meteorological forcing.\nHorsburgh et al. (2008) compared the variability of\nthis type of manipulation with that obtained from\na 24-member short-range ensemble of surge model\nruns driven by a perturbed initial condition ensemble\nof local area models (Flowerdew et al. 2010). They\nfound that altering the phase relationship between\ntide and weather for their particular event caused the\nskew surges at Southend-on-Sea to differ by only\n5 cm, but we shall see below that much greater vari-\nation is possible with our more extreme meteorolog-\nical forcing.\nWe adjusted the phase relationship between the me-\nteorological forcing and the tide at hourly increments\naround several different selected tides. Residuals were\nderived in the usual way (by subtracting a \u2018\u2018tide only\u2019\u2019\nrun) to capture the tide\u2013surge interaction. As an ex-\nample of the results of this sort of adjustment, the im-\nportance of nonlinear interactions is underscored in\nFig. 10, where we can see that, for example, the same\nmeteorological forcing that produces a residual of nearly\n4 m (but a low impact) if it arrives at an early stage of the\nrising tide produces only a 2-m residual (but a high im-\npact) if it arrives at high tide. This figure also makes\na striking illustration of the improved impact relevance\nof skew surge over residual: for the high-impact event,\nthe skew surge is large and the maximum residual is\nFIG. 8. (top left) Scatterplot as in Fig. 7, but not normalized, for the 2-yr return level.

After phase adjustment around its associated\nmodeled tide of 1.69 m, the weather system giving the\nlargest skew surge overall in our ensemble now produced\na skew surge of 2.0 m (caseA in Table 1).When the same\nstorm was subsequently phase shifted around a modeled\nspring tide of 2.35 m, the maximum skew surge obtained\nwas 1.82 m, corresponding to a total water level of 4.17 m\n(case A1C in Table 1).\nOne of our selected model tides had a very similar as-\ntronomical high (2.65 m) to that in the analysis by G.\nSiggers (2007, personal communication) based on obser-\nvations of the 1953 event. The model tide-only tidal range\nwas also very similar (see Fig. 12). After phase adjustment\naround this tide, the weather system giving the largest\nskew surge overall in our ensemble now produced a skew\nsurge of 1.7 m (case \u2018\u2018A2\u2019\u2019 in Table 1). A comparison of\nthis phase-adjusted modeled event and the analysis by\nSiggers is shown in Figs. 11 and 12.\nIn the analysis of the 1953 event presented byHorsburgh\net al. (2008), the maximum water level is 4.57 m. The\ncorresponding model maximum is 4.37 m. Siggers, in his\nanalysis, puts the peak level at 4.63 m and estimates the\nobservational uncertainty in the peak levels to be around\n0.2 m. Thus, we can say that our simulated extreme water\nFIG. 9.

It could\nbe argued that by adjusting the phase, we have effectively\nincreased the empirical return period (because we have\nadjusted the joint probability of surge and tide) so that it\nis now substantially greater than the total number of\nsimulated years in the entire ensemble, which is 1639 yr,\nwhereas the 1953 event is usually regarded as a less-than-\n500-yr event. This is consistent with our more compre-\nhensive validation, based on a comparison of model and\nobservation statistics for ports around the U.K. coastline,\nshown inTE2100 (Howard et al. 2008). It is also consistent\nwith a more general paradigm of increasing realism as we\nmove from a \u2018\u2018globally driven\u2019\u2019 simulation [unrealistically\nsmall surges (section 5a)] to a \u2018\u2018regionally driven\u2019\u2019 simu-\nlation (more realistic but still small) and finally to an\nanalysis of observations (most realistic).\nd. The effect of large mean sea level rise on\nmodeled surge propagation\nAll long-term (149 yr) surge simulations performed\nfor the TE2100 (Howard et al. 2008) and UKCP09\n(Marine; Lowe et al. 2009) projects used present-day\nbathymetry in the surge model. The projected mean sea\nlevel changes were then added linearly to any trend in\nextreme surges that was identified. This is valid only if the\neffect of mean sea level changes on surge is linear, to\na good approximation. Lowe et al. (2001) found that to\na first-order approximation, time-mean sea level rise and\nchanges in surge can be added linearly around the United\nKingdom for mean sea level increase up to about 0.5 m.\nSterl et al. (2009) obtained a similar result for mean sea\nlevel increase up to 2 m. Here we further test this as-\nsumption for our location of special interest at theThames\nestuary by comparing surges with the same forcing but\ndifferent bathymetry representingmean sea level increase\nup to 5 m. While it is considered extremely unlikely that\nsuch an increase will occur within the next century\n(Pfeffer et al. 2008, e.g.), it is consistent with a complete\ncollapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (which might\noccur on a longer time scale) and impact studies such as\nthat described by Dawson et al. (2005) have used com-\nparable values.\nIn the first case, we use our standard present-day ba-\nthymetry. In the second case, we add 5 m to the bathym-\netry, everywhere in the domain (i.e., we make the model\nsea 5 m deeper). In reality under a 5-m increase of mean\nsea level, the area covered by water would also change; we\nsuggest that this would have a negligible effect on surge\u2013\ntide interaction, since the area increase would apply to\nwater of depth 5 m or less. We assume that the bulk of the\ntide and surge energy is carried in deeper water. In each\nTABLE 1. Results of sensitivity tests in which the surge\u2013tide\nphase relationship was adjusted.

It can\nbe seen that the primary effect is on the timing: in both\nmeteorology-forced (shown in Fig. 13) and tide-onlymode\n(not shown, but the pattern of change is very similar), the\nsignal arrives about one hour earlier with the increased\nbathymetry. This change is physically reasonable\u2014we\nwould expect the tide to travel faster on deeper water\u2014\nand its magnitude is consistent with the following ap-\nproximate calculation. Recall that the horizontal scale of\nthe tide is large relative to the depth of the oceans and\nconsequently the tide is well approximated as a shallow\nwater wave with wave speed (phase speed)\nffiffiffiffiffi\ngh\np\n, where g\nis gravitational acceleration and h is the water depth. As-\nsume that the tide begins its journey from Wick (approx\n588N, 38W) at about the same time in either case. This is\nnot an unreasonable approximation since we do not\nchange the timing of the tidal boundary forcing and the\nwater is, typically, deep enough between the northern and\neastern boundaries of the surge model domain and Wick\nthat we may neglect the effect of the bathymetry increase\nfor that part of the journey. Suppose the tide currently\ntravels from Wick to Southend-on-Sea (about 860 km)\nin 13.5 h, giving a shallow-water phase speed of about\n17.7 m s21 and an implied shallow-water depth of about\n32 m.Adding 5 m to give a new depth of 37 m gives a new\nshallow-water phase speed of about 19 m s21, allowing\nthe tide to arrive about 57 min earlier at Southend-on-Sea\nfor the same start time at Wick.\nThe effect on the total sea surface elevation is less than\n10 cm, with a slightly larger effect on the skew surge;\nhowever, in either case, this may be due to the faster tide\nproducing a change in the tide\u2013surge phase relationship\n(see section 5c) and so should not be interpreted as\na systematic change brought about by the change in the\nwater depth. Smaller changes in bathymetry (not shown)\nproduce correspondingly smaller changes in timing and\nelevation.\n6. Conclusions\nOur main conclusion is this: to diagnose the presence\nor absence of statistically significant trends in surge at\nthe mouth of the Thames estuary using a coastal shelf\nmodel driven by the Met Office Hadley Centre global\nclimate model HadCM3, we find that it is not necessary\nto downscale using a regional model.

If trends in\nthe globally driven simulation are found, then a compari-\nson of globally and regionally driven simulations provides\na scaling factor to interpret the trends to real-world scale.\nThis scaling factor varies only slowly with location around\nthe southern North Sea. An alternative would be to use\nobservations to derive the scaling factor. This againwould\nsidestep the need for a regional model.\nWe also find that simulated large increases in mean\nsea level (up to 5 m) have very little effect on extreme\nsurges relative to the astronomical tide at the Thames\nestuary, the primary effect being on the speed of prop-\nagation of tide and surge.\nFinally, we support the use of skew surge as a more\nsignificant and practical measure of the effect of an ex-\ntreme event.\nAcknowledgments.
