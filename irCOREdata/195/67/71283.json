We chart examples of this in a video recording of a meeting between people \nwith intellectual disabilities and support staff in a group home. The recordings reveal \nthat even individuals with very limited spoken language can, and do, design non-vocal \ngestures to make intelligible contributions to the conversation as it is unfolding. But \nthey are often unseen. Were such contributions to be noticed and taken up, we argue, \nthey would reveal a variety of substantive contributions to the interaction, notably \nresidents' concerns to display their understanding of the current topic and its \ninteractional requirements, for themselves and others. We consider whether, and how, \nsuch unratified contributions may arise out of a dilemma faced by staff, and manifest \na diminished identity that staff members (and researchers) unwittingly impose on \nresidents. \n \nOn not being noticed      2   \nOn not being noticed: intellectual disabilities and the non-vocal register \n \nThis paper examines non-verbal communication in a house meeting for people \nwith intellectual disabilities, some of whom have very limited spoken language. We \nillustrate that if research attention is focused exclusively on what goes on verbally, \nsome significant fraction of what goes on may be missed, and this may have \nunsuspected implications for how we see the identities of the actors, and the extent to \nwhich they can exert influence over what goes on around them.  \nIn many branches of the social sciences, especially those with a respect for the \nuse of language in interaction, video analysis has been increasingly used to pay \nattention to non-spoken, visual elements under the interactants' communicative \ncontrol (see, for example, Goodwin, 1995, 2000a & b, 2003;  Heath, 1986; Heath and \nLuff, 1992, Mondada 2003). What the accumulation of multi-media work tells us is \nthat when we miss these contributions, we risk missing an important channel through \nwhich people initiate, comment on, or otherwise contribute to the interaction, soberly \nor playfully \u2013 and, in the context of policy initiatives which stress empowerment and \nindependence, we may miss a channel in which people with intellectual disabilities \nact as autonomous contributors to the social life of the local community. Since most \nof the verbal interactions in the meeting analysed in this paper revolve around the \nstaff directing questions to the residents, restricting focus on what goes on verbally \nhas the danger of leading us to see the residents in diminished terms, that is, we see \ntheir contributions as reactive, dependent and lacking in spontaneity.  \nThis is not primarily an analyst\u2019s problem, however. Discourse analysts' \nhistorical (though changing) tendency to set more store by speech and text than \ngesture and movement is, more importantly, found in the way staff interact with those \nthey support. Even in settings where people with intellectual disabilities appear to \nhave limited abilities to understand or answer speech, we still see staff talking their \nway through activities with service-users (Bradshaw, 2001; Houghton, Bronicki, & \nGuess, 1987; McConkey, Morris & Purcell, 1999). In settings where people with \nintellectual disabilities use a mixture of speech and gestures, our observations in a \nvariety of residential services have shown that there is a tendency to privilege the \nverbal, to value verbal utterances more highly than non-verbal, and to notice verbal \nbehaviours more readily than gestures. While this is not invariably the case, since \nOn not being noticed      3   \nmany non-verbal contributions are indeed acknowledged, it is nevertheless often seen \nfor three reasons.  \nFirstly, noticing non-verbal contributions unaccompanied by speech or sound \nrequires visual attention, and in group homes, for example, there may be a distracting \nnumber of people present in any episode. Secondly, even if noticed, non-verbal \ncontributions may not be clear in their meaning, even after staff attempts at \nclarification (Edge, 2001; Grove, Bunning, Porter & Olsson, 1999; Harris, 2003; \nJenkinson, 1993; Puddicombe, 1995; for examples of the difficulties in clarifying the \npointing gestures of a person with aphasia, see Goodwin, 2000). Thirdly, and \nexacerbating the first two reasons, the staff member involved in the interaction may \nwell be facing a dilemma (Beamer & Brooks, 2001; Jenkinson et al, 1992; Antaki, \nFinlay, Sheridan, Jingree & Walton, 2006). They may have institutional demands on \ntheir time which compete with the need to give attention to possibly subtle and \nobscure gestures (Houghton et al, 1987). The staff member may therefore have good \norganisational reasons for failing to register residents' attempts at communication, \nwhether these attempts are clear in their meaning or not. But whichever of these three \nreasons are in play, the question can be asked - what happens when a gesture is \noverlooked? \n \nConversation Analysis as an appropriate method \nWhat sort of research will help to illuminate what happens when people \noverlook or fail to register their fellow-conversationalists' gestures? Certain popular \nmethodologies are seemingly disqualified at first sight: one cannot interview \ninformants, nor administer questionnaires, nor inspect documentary records (the three \nmost popular research methods in the social sciences) when what is in question is \nprecisely something not-noticed in the first place. So seeing what the staff do has to \nbe researched in some other way. Can we not interview the people being not-noticed? \nPossibly; but people's retrospections are suspect in general, and, if what they are \nasked to remember is fleeting and perhaps unconscious, are likely to produce merely \nguesswork - if any answer at all. What, then, can we do? \nWhile most studies of meetings involving people with intellectual disabilities \nuse audio recordings (e.g. Antaki et al, 2006; Jingree, Finlay & Antaki, 2006) or \nparticipant observation and interviews (e.g. Alexander & Hegarty, 2001; Carnaby, \nLewis, Martin, Naylor & Stewart, 2003; Goodley, 2000; Hagner, Helm & \nOn not being noticed      4   \nButterworth, 1996), the method we need is one that is alive to the moment-by-\nmoment unfolding of the interaction between staff member and resident, and not \nreliant either on potentially faulty memory, or on the inevitably incomplete record \neven of the best note-taker. We need an objective recording which we can inspect \nclosely and repeatedly, to explicate both the vocal sequence of interaction and its \ncomplementary, or independent, non-vocal element. The method we propose using is \nConversation Analysis (henceforth, CA), which has an elaborate conceptual apparatus \nfor uncovering social action as it is achieved through the medium of talk in \ninteraction.  \nIt is worth distinguishing CA from other forms of discourse analysis in: its data; \nits methods; and its theoretical commitments. (For a sense of CA's beginnings, see \nSacks, (1992); for overviews of its methods and style, see Hutchby and Wooffitt, \n(1998), and for a practical guide to its methods, ten Have, 1999).  CA works from \naudio and video records of the scene as it played out, arguing that these, although \nimperfect, are the closest representation we can have which will allow for the repeated \nhearings and viewings that are crucial to tease out the subtle practices of everyday \naction. It does not impose codes or categories on what it sees (unlike, say, a Bales-\ntype analysis of interaction; for a comparison of Bales' classic Interaction Process \nAnalysis, on the one hand, as an exemplar of how to impose categories on the free \nflow of interaction, and CA, on the other, see Per\u00e4kyl\u00e4, 2004). Rather, it tracks the \nparticipants' organisation of their turns-at-talk to see how they bring off the business \nat hand. Such organisation is subtle, flexible, and though resisting the application of \nbroad-brush coding schemes, is amenable to an analysis of its synchronized workings. \nAbove all of these matters of data and practice, Conversation Analysis' theoretical \ncommitment has, for us, the attractive ethnomethodological injunction to stay close to \nthe local meaning of the proceedings: that is to say, to let the participants in the scene \ndetermine what they mean, by their visible display and their visible uptake (or, as we \nshall see, non-uptake) of each others' turns.  \nIn all this, CA departs from other forms of discourse analysis, which are \nvariously text-based, interview-driven, reliant on analysts' prior theoretical orientation \n(in, for example, the application of categories into which to code data) and silent \nabout the onward development of interaction as it unfolds in sequence (for a critical \ncomparison of CA and other forms of discourse analysis, see Wooffitt, 2006, and \nAntaki (forthcoming)). All of these are suitable for some research questions, but not, \nOn not being noticed      5   \nwe think, in our project here, which must be anchored in a capture of what actually \nhappened, and be analysed as its organisation plays out in real time. \nA further word is in order about a piece of inspiring research that shares CA's \nethnomethodological commitment to local meaning, but realises it differently: David \nGoode's classic A World Without Words (Goode, 1994). Readers will find, in its \npages, a social scientist whose method of working is to immerse himself as far as is \npossible in the world of his research subject (though such a term is inappropriately \ncool, given the warmth and intimacy of Goode's engagement with the deaf and blind \nchildren he studies). Cleaving closely to ethnomethodology's roots in Garfinkel's \nprogramme (Garfinkel, 1967), Goode tries to share the children's \"form of life\" in all \nits apparent insularity and deviation from \"normal\" standards of propriety, hygiene, \nand communal responsibility. By doing so he hopes to find a way of understanding \nand describing, to an academic audience, the children's own ethno-methods, or \nindigenous sense-making practices. He wants to give, as it were, an \"inside-out\" \nperspective, from which vantage point the children's (apparently maladaptive and \ndeficient) habits make sense.  \nThere is, however, a profound difference between Goode's realisation of the \nethnomethodological project, and CA's; though both insist on the uncovering of local \nmeaning, CA does so by the capture of events on audio or video, and inspecting just \nthose records for their structural, turn-taking organisation; whereas, in keeping with \nwhat has now become a different tradition, Goode's procedure is determinedly more \ncatholic, allowing (indeed mandating) a personal immersion into the world of his \nsubjects, both as ethnographic participant-observer and, ideally, as a sharer of their \ninner, subjective world-view. This we do not aspire to.  Although the reader will see \nimages of our research participants (those with and without an intellectual \nimpairment), and see transcriptions of their words, we do not claim to have been able \nto share their perspective; our aim is, more modestly, to reproduce their actions and \nsee how they navigate their world as a matter of visible and public engagement. \n \nConversation Analysis and Intellectual Disability \nThe great bulk of what CA has found out about people's organisation of their \nturns at talk has been based on people without a diagnosis of intellectual impairment, \nso it is fair to ask whether its insights are reasonably applicable when we turn to \ninteractions involving people with intellectual impairments of various degrees of  \nOn not being noticed      6   \nseverity.  The question was posed in two studies in the eighties, and the results \nshowed that people with quite profound impairments could and did organise their part \nin an interaction according to the rules and conventions of \"ordinary\" speakers - they \nthemselves were (apart from problems in memory, vocabulary and reasoning power) \nquite indistinguishably \"ordinary\" in their take up of turns, their tracking of others' \nturns, their distinctions between questions, imperatives and other, still subtler \nconversational acts; their use and understanding of pauses, intonation, emphasis, \noverlap, and many other such features of the design of turns at talk (Yearley and \nBrewer, 1989; Wooton1989).  \nSince then, CA has been used productively to study the engagement of people \nwith intellectual disabilities in clinical assessment and service evaluation (e.g. Antaki, \n2001; Antaki, Young & Finlay, 2002; Rapley & Antaki, 1996), the manner in which \nthey manage their identities in interviews (e.g. Rapley, Kiernan and Antaki, 1998), \ntheir contributions to service-user meetings (e.g. Antaki et al, 2006; Jingree et al, \n2006), the interactional production of \u2018incompetence\u2019 and \u2018acquiescence\u2019 (and \nresistance to this \u2013 Rapley, 2004) and the ways in which service-user identities are \nconnected to staff identities in case worker consultations (Wareing and Newell, 2005), \namong other topics. \nTaking a conversation analytic perspective on this data, then, we shall be able to \nexamine interactional details of what happens from moment-to-moment, and \nparticularly how contributions are formatted and how the actors treat (or fail to treat) \neach others\u2019 turns. CA is sensitive both to how utterances (e.g. questions and \nstatements) are responded to or assessed by recipients, and also, as we shall see in this \npaper, how utterances are not actually oriented to at all. Our analysis will offer \ninterpretations of how these unratified gestures - those gestures not taken up or \nacknowledged -  might have been dealt with by members of staff, but were not; and \nthe implications that this has for the identities of the residents. We shall try to give \nevidence for our proposition that analysts' (and more importantly, staff members') \nconcentration on vocal language can lead us to miss both indications of interactional \ncompetence and important potential aspects of the residents' identity as it plays out in \ninteraction. Were they noticed more consistently, they would lead us to a more \nrespectful understanding of both the competencies and the identities of the actors \nconcerned. \n \nOn not being noticed      7   \nMethod \nOverview \nWe closely examine seven videotaped episodes from a residents' meeting \nchaired by a staff member. These meetings are held on a monthly basis to evaluate \nand determine the program of activities in which the residents participate. In the first \nsix cases the aim is to reveal residents' meaningful gestural contributions unnoticed by \nthe staff. The analysis is qualitative, based on a close inspection of the exact timing \nand design of utterances and gestures, applying the conceptual apparatus of \nConversation Analysis (for an account of which, see above). In the last case that we \nanalyse, we demonstrate how positive it can be when such gestures are indeed taken \nup. The recordings were part of a nine month study of several residential services for \npeople with intellectual disabilities in the UK, involving both ethnographic \nobservations and video recordings. Although examples are presented here from one \nmeeting, similar occurrences involving the same residents were observed in other \nformal meetings in the service in question. \n \nData \nThe data for this paper comes from a video-recording of a \u2018house meeting\u2019 in a \ngroup home for five men with intellectual disabilities. Each of these men has been in \nreceipt of residential care services for at least 30 years. All had been residents of the \nsame institutional hospital, though they were not necessarily on the same ward. In the \nlate 1990s, with the dissolution of the institutional hospitals, they moved into their \npresent home; thus they have almost a ten-year history as a group. The history of their \nrelationships with members of the staff team varies. One member of staff has been \nworking with some of the residents for 17 years, though most members of the staff \nteam have been with the residents for between 7 and 4 years. In all cases, except \nDom, the residents\u2019 files communicate only that each is diagnosed as having \n\u2018Learning Disabilities\u2019 (this label has the same meaning in the UK as \u2018intellectual \ndisabilities\u2019 and \u2018mental retardation\u2019 in other countries); Dom\u2019s file communicates the \nhe is diagnosed as having \u2018Learning Disabilities and Down\u2019s Syndrome\u2019. All the \nresidents require some level of support from members of staff to engage in activities \nranging from intimate care, to cooking, to accessing services and resources in the \ncommunity. Further, they all require support from members of staff to communicate \ntheir needs and wishes to members of their wider community, e.g., when shopping or \nOn not being noticed      8   \nwhen buying a drink in a local pub. No other, more detailed, clinical information, for \nexample measures of the verbal or cognitive abilities of the residents, was available to \nthe researchers. In order to further contextualize the data, we briefly describe the \nnormal communicative practices of each of the residents, as established by fieldwork \nin the months preceding the recordings (n.b. all names are pseudonyms): \nAlec communicates frequently within the vocal register. His speech is however \nidiosyncratic with most utterances being formulated as questions. This pattern even \napplies to situations where Alec is aiming to impart information.  \nDom is capable of communicating vocally, though his speech is indistinct and not \nreadily understandable. Consequently, Dom makes regular use of signs, many of \nwhich are idiosyncratic and require a familiar audience. Dom often uses signs to the \nexclusion of vocal speech and is often prompted to speak in order for him to be \nunderstood. \nHenry is able to communicate vocally. He tends to wait for others to initiate vocal \ninteractions, affording him the possibility of responding in limited terms, often just \nechoing the appropriate word or short phrase necessary to communicate \n(dis)agreement. Henry will often direct the attention of others to physical objects in \norder for the meaning of ambiguous utterances to be more fully understood.  \nVictor is capable of communicating vocally and of using full sentences. His speech is, \nhowever, at a very low volume, often to the extent of being inaudible to others. He \ntherefore makes extensive use of non-verbal behaviours such as facial expressions and \ngestures.  \nOliver is capable of communicating vocally. Although he is capable of using full \nsentences he tends to use short phrases or single words. \n \nScene \nThe meeting lasts for just over 16 minutes. Seated around a dining table were \nthe five residents (Dominic, Alec, Henry, Oliver and Victor), two staff members \n(Dave and Brenda) and Chris, the researcher. Dave, a staff member, chaired the \nmeeting. He was sitting next to Oliver and Alec. He read out the minutes and then \nwent through the agenda items.  For items of information, Dave explained them and \nthen checked each person understood. Where there were decisions to be made about \nfuture activities, Dave described the activities and then asked each resident in turn. \nDave also recorded the decisions made in a book. All the official business of the \nOn not being noticed      9   \nmeeting, then, was initiated by Dave and passed through him. During this activity, \nAlec, one of the residents, frequently addressed Chris, and so there are often two \nconversations going on, one between Dave and the resident he is addressing, the other \nbetween Alec and Chris. \nThe still photograph in Figure 1 blurs the participants' faces, but gives a sense of \nthe general scene. We shall augment the text with images twice more, when it is \nparticularly useful to see the gesture. In most episodes, however, we shall not present \nphotos for reasons of space. \n \n[-------------------- figure 1 about here --------------------] \n \nTranscription \nThe transcription system used here attempts to record both what happens \nverbally and non-verbally. It should be noted that, of course, no transcription system \ncan hope to capture everything in the visual scene (see Goodwin, 2000c, for a \ndiscussion on the limits of transcription). We recognise that although the \ntranscriptions the reader will encounter below look complex, they are nevertheless \nsignificant simplifications of the scene as it actually happened. We have chosen not to \nnotate fine details of gaze, posture and body-movement. Instead we emphasise the \nparticular aspect of the visual scene that interests us, namely unratified gestures (that \nis, those which are not taken up in any observable way). To ease an accessible \ndiscussion of what is going on in the gestures, we have described arm and hand-\nmovements in common-sense terms (e.g. 'makes cycling motion with hands\u2019), rather \nthan use the technical apparatus of such advanced systems as those of Kendon (see his \ndiscussion of the issues involved in Kendon, 1997). The notation conventions are in \nthe Appendix. \n \nAnalysis \nSelection of episodes \nThe meeting is full of occasions on which residents pointed, nodded, shook their \nheads, shrugged, and smiled, as well as simulating activities with their hands and arms \nsuch as drinking, pedalling, spinning a record and flying. We have collected below \nepisodes in which a resident made a gesture which, had it been responded to, might \nhave elicited from members of staff an orientation to the person's positive qualities. \nOn not being noticed      10   \nAmong those qualities are those of being helpful, jocular, altruistic, interactionally \nmore autonomous, self-directed and competent. We shall describe seven such \nepisodes, from two residents who are largely non-vocal (Dom and Henry; see the \ndescriptions above).  \nIt is worth recalling that, from the point of view of the staff members in the \ninteraction, the dilemma in each episode is the same: to invest time in registering, or \nseeking to register, these non-vocal gestures and so recognise and appreciate \nresidents' contributions; or, on the other hand, to pursue the business at hand with \ndespatch.  \n \nEpisode 1: Henry: helping to answer a question \nThe following example takes place over approximately fifteen seconds. The \nchair (Dave) is showing the residents some picture books which are intended to help \nthe residents communicate about medical problems. At the beginning of the extract, \nDave and Brenda are talking to Oliver, who is sitting between them. They are pointing \nto pictures and discussing them. Henry is on the opposite side of the table, next to \nChris (the researcher). The most salient one to note is the use of square brackets to \nidentify points at which there is overlap in talk (or gesture). For example, at lines 6 \nand 7 below, Henry's hand moves away from his cup while Dave is finishing off \nsaying one of those?. \n \nExtract 1: VD03 1.58. \"Glasses\"  \n1    Oliver   ((points to book and looks at Alec)) gla::ss\u00b0es\u00b0, \n2    Dave    glasses, >there you go<, ((points to book, body oriented  \n3            towards Oliver)) gla:sses, whassat one.

[let Dominic=  \n20   Henry                                              [((picks up  \n21          glasses with left hand))  \n22   Dave   = >have a quick look,< \n23   Dave    ((looks at Alec))  \n24   Henry  ((holding up glasses, looking at Dave))   \n25   Dave    ((looking at Dom)) [Dominic have a look.

He sees Dave and \nBrenda (the two staff members) talking with his fellow-resident Oliver about the \nmeaning of various pictures in a book. At the point we join the scene, Oliver offers a \ncandidate name for the picture he is looking at: \" Glasses\". Dave, the staff member, \nseems to ratify this as an adequate answer (Glasses, there you go) and initiates a new \nround of pointing and identifying (what's that one?). From Dave's point of view, the \n'glasses' item has been dealt with, and his business now is getting Oliver to identify \nthe new item, prompting him with a hint from Oliver's own life - your brother has \none. Note the two pauses (denoted by (.)) after Dave\u2019s questions in which Oliver does \nnot respond. \nIt is just at this point - where Oliver is manifestly needing a prompt to help him \nanswer - that Henry begins the gesture that will eventually produce his own pair of \nglasses from his pocket. For Henry, it may not be obvious that Dave has moved on to \nask about the next item in the book (which Henry is too far away to see). Henry sees \nOliver not responding to something to do with \"glasses\". Producing his own glasses \nOn not being noticed      12   \nwould be, in those circumstances, understandable as his own version of a prompt to \nOliver: this is what Dave is talking about. That would show Henry's appreciation of a \nnumber of things, which we set out here rather laboriously (we shall not make this \nsort of explicit list in later analyses, where it would be otiose): \n(a) that Oliver is not understanding something about the question that the staff \nmember has posed him; \n(b) that a possible cause of his failure is the medium of representation - Oliver may \nnot fully understand the photograph or picture as it appears in the book; \n(c) that if this is the case, then Henry can unilaterally step in and help; and \n(d) Oliver's problem can be fixed by the prompt of an actual and familiar \nrepresentation of the object, namely Henry's own glasses. \n \nBecause of the camera angle, it is hard to make out where Henry\u2019s gaze is \ndirected when he makes these actions \u2013 it could be either towards Dave or Oliver. If \nthese actions are oriented towards Dave rather than Oliver, there is another possibility \nas to what is happening here: Henry might be seen as answering Dave\u2019s question \n\u2018Who\u2019s got one of those?\u2019 It is relevant here that he begins to move his hand \nimmediately after this question, and before Dave has suggested the answer \u2018your \nbrother\u2019. An alternative gloss, then, is that by producing his own glasses for Dave he \nis in effect saying \u2018I do\u2019.  \nIn other words, were Henry's gesture to be ratified, it could be hailed as a \nhelpful, if discreet, diagnosis and treatment of a fellow-member's problem, or as an \nanswer to a question that went unanswered. However, neither staff member (Dave or \nBrenda) registers it. Chris, the researcher, does register it (line 11: you got yours in \nyour pocket?), but in a way that acknowledges only that Henry has recognised glasses \nas the current topic. That Henry\u2019s non-verbal actions with his glasses extend beyond \nChris\u2019s comment suggests that Henry's aim was not merely to show that he knew \nwhat was being talked about, and further supports the interpretation of this action as \ndesigned to be helpful. But now consider it from Dave's point of view. He is chairing \nthe meeting, so the official business (reading out minutes, going through the agenda, \nensuring turn-taking) all goes through him. He has finished the glasses item and \nturned to a new one. At this point - as we shall see throughout all our extracts and \npervasively as he fulfils his institutional duties - he is faced with the dilemma of either \npressing on with this agenda item (among many) or monitoring and reacting to non-\nOn not being noticed      13   \nagenda business. His choice, at this point, is to proceed with the agenda; and, at this \npoint, Henry\u2019s contribution is missed. \n \nEpisode 2: Henry: augmenting Dave\u2019s words with a gesture \nIn this episode, Dave is checking whether all residents are happy with the \nmeeting being video-recorded. \n \nExtract 2: VD03 5.38. \"Video\" \n    Dave    ((nods)) Yeah.  1 \n            [        (1.0)           ] 2 \n    Dave    [(turns and points at Dom)) ] 3 \n    Dave    Still happy, ((nods once))  with the video, ((pointing at video  4 \n            camera above and behind Dom  and giving it a brief glance ))  5 \n            [          .8         ] 6 \n    Dom     [   ((nods minimally)  ]   7 \n    Dave    ((turns to Alec))  you still happy with \u00b0the video\u00b0 8 \n    Henry   ((turns head to camera, begins to raise hand))     9 \nAlec    er ye [ah. 10 \n    Dave         [((turns away from Alec and looks down towards his book 11 \nHenry           [((looks fully at camera, raises hand and points at it while 12 \nlooking at it)) 13 \n    Dave    ((not registering Henry's action)) yep. 14 \n    Henry   ((puts hand down and looks first at Dave, who is looking at book, 15 \n             then looks at [Chris)) 16 \n    Chris                  [((to Henry)) is [that all right? 17 \n    Dave                                [((still looking down)) right 18 \n    Henry   yea::h. 19 \n \nWe join at the point where Dave\u2019s question is directed to Alec, who is sitting \nnext to him. Henry is watching them. Dave has gone round the table asking each \nresident in turn whether they are happy with the video recording, using a \u2018no problem\u2019 \nformat common in surveys (Houtkoop-Steenstra 2000). Alec is the last to be asked. In \nthe previous sequence, Dave has pointed at the camera when asking Dom if he was \n\u2018still happy with the video\u2019. Here we see that overlapping the exchanges between Alec \nOn not being noticed      14   \nand Dave, Henry turns and points to the camera (beginning just after Dave uses the \nword \u2018video\u2019). However, nobody is looking at him and so this contribution goes \nunnoticed. Henry\u2019s gesture is formatted similarly to Dave\u2019s in the first turn, in which \npresumably the pointing was used to clarify the verbal question. If noticed, it might \nfunction in this way. However, it is not a staff member who registers any of this; it is \nthe researcher, Chris, who is free of institutional obligations. It is he who now notices \nHenry\u2019s orientation as an initiator, and asks him \u2018Is that all right?\u2019 \nAt this point it is important to raise a question which will occur to the reader: \nwhy make so much of the staff member not noticing what the resident does - after all, \nit might be observed, the staff member has other things in play, and can't monitor \neverything. We are familiar with workaday group meetings, at which many gestures \n(and indeed spoken turns) pass unremarked. That is a fair point. It is indeed a \ndilemma for any chair; whether to progress the institutional demands of the meeting's \nagenda on the one hand, and hear out the participants on the other. Our point here, \nhowever, is that the institutional imperative of a residence for people with intellectual \nimpairment seems - on the face of it, as it is enshrined in policy document, mission \nstatements and so on - to privilege the latter over the former: to take (extra) care in \nrespecting residents' attempts to overcome their impairments in  communication.  \n \nEpisode 3: Dominic: possible on-topic correction missed \nLet us now turn to another resident, Dominic.  In the following episode, Dave is \ngoing round the table soliciting individual replies to a given agenda item. On this \noccasion he is asking residents about whether they want to go cycling. Victor and \nOliver have already given their responses. \n \nExtract 3: VD03 5.54: \" Cycling\" \nDave ((to Alec)) still want to go cycling e[very week? 1 \nAlec                                  [er=yeah:: 2 \nDave ((looking at Dom, head inclined back, eyebrows raised)) still wannu  3 \n go and  see Jackie ((brings head level)) every week?  4 \n [          (4.0 silence until line 10           ] 5 \nDom   [((points at [Brenda)) 6 \nDave                 [((looks at Brenda  7 \nDave ((points at Brenda, looks back at Dominic, then at Brenda, then  8 \nOn not being noticed      15   \n at Dominic)))  9 \nDave Brenda ((still pointing at her)) (.) 10 \nDom  ((points at ceiling)) 11 \nDave ((drops hand to book \u2013 looking at Dom)) upstairs, 12 \n  (.5) 13 \nDom ((slowly moves hand (palm down, flat) in rising motion above  14 \n head like plane taking off))  15 \nDave  no: = 16 \nDom  [((points at Brenda)) 17 \nDave  [((looks at Brenda when Dom points at her)) =we\u2019re on about  18 \n ((makes pedalling movement with hands)) cyclin, (.) 19 \n [       (2.0)      ] 20 \nDom [   ((drops hand)) ] 21 \nDave not about ((makes same flying hand movement as Dom)) flyin,  22 \n we\u2019re on about cyclin.

There follows an exchange between Dominic and \nDave, with Dave attending visually to what Dominic is communicating. Initially, \nDave tries to fit single words to each gesture. Dominic points to Brenda, and after a \npause (indicating trouble), Dave offers the interpretation: \u2018Brenda\u2019. Once this is \nspoken, Dominic offers another gesture, pointing to the ceiling. Dave offers: \n\u2018upstairs\u2019. One both occasions Dave uses rising intonations patterns, which are often \nused by speakers when there is a possibility that their recognition is wrong (\"try-\nOn not being noticed      16   \nmarkers\" \u2013 Sacks & Schegloff, 1979; for examples in hint-guess sequences in aphasic \ninteraction see Goodwin, Goodwin & Olsher, 2002). Then Dominic offers a third \ngesture. Dave interprets this as flying, which would not be germane to the cycling \nitem currently being pursued, and so he offers a correction (No - we're on about \ncycling, not about flying, we're on about cycling \u2013 see Schegloff, 1992 for a \ndiscussion of ways in which breaches, or alleged breaches, of sense or procedure are \n\"repaired\"). Dave does give Dominic his visual attention for about .8 of a second on \ncompleting this turn (line 24), but Dominic seems not to respond.  \nThis type of interaction is similar to the \u2018hint and guess\u2019 sequences described in \nresearch on interactions involving people with aphasia (e.g. Goodwin, 1995, 2000; \nLind, 2005; Laakso and Klippi 1999). However, while in these studies, the person \nwith aphasia uses \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018no\u2019, and bodily movements to confirm or reject the guesses \nprovided by their interactional partners, in this case Dominic does not confirm or deny \nthe candidate words Dave is offering and so we are not sure whether Dave\u2019s \nsuggestions are accepted. Responding to each word with a different gesture might \nmean the word was correct, the next gesture representing the next concept in the \nmessage, or it might mean the word was incorrect, in which case the next gesture \nmight represent a second attempt, a type of gestural rephrasing (for examples of this \nsee Goodwin, 2000; Lind, 2005). Given this uncertainty, the collaborative \nconstruction of meaning in this situation is rather difficult. A second point to note is \nthat Dave, who treats the contribution as off-topic, does not take it up as a change in \ntopic to be pursued, nor does he take it as Dominic offering an alternative activity to \ncycling (which might have altered the candidate words Dave suggested in response to \nthe gestures \u2013 for an example of this in aphasic interaction see Goodwin, 2003). \nRather, Dave rather shuts it down because there is business at hand, which is to go \nthrough the items on the meeting\u2019s agenda.  \nAt this point (line 27 in the transcript above), presumably having concluded that \nDom has nothing further to say on  whatever issue concerns him (which is in any case \napparently not relevant to the agenda item of cycling), Dave turns back to his minute \nbook. In doing so, he does not see Dom\u2019s further attempt to point at Brenda, nor does \nhe see Dom\u2019s final gesture, a circular hand movement. This gesture could be \ninterpreted in a number of ways. It could be a reassertion: that, whatever it is he wants \nto say, it is connected to cycling. Or it could be an acknowledgement that Dom now \nappreciates that his reference to upstairs, or flying, was wrong, and that he now \nOn not being noticed      17   \nunderstands that cycling is the issue. Either could have been receipted as intelligible \ncontributions which make sense of his previously enigmatic turns. But as Dave is no \nlonger looking, the opportunity to take up either possibility is missed. \nNotice that Dominic\u2019s turns are in several ways well-designed. He produces a \nnew gesture only after Dave has named the current one, thus piecing together an \nutterance jointly in a step-by-step fashion. Although Dave does give time for Dominic \nto elaborate while in clear view (see lines 7-21 above), it is not quite enough time. \nInevitably, Dave must make a judgement about how long is long enough before he \nmust return to the competing requirement of the meeting's agenda. As the chair of the \nmeeting, his dilemma is ever-present. \n \nEpisode 4: Dominic's thumbs- up approval  \nThis extract follows immediately from extract 3 (from which we reproduce the \nlast three lines). Here we see Dominic make two conventional gestures (\"thumbs up\") \nthat appear relevant to the business in hand. \n \nExtract 4: VD03, 6.14 \"Thumbs-up\".\n    Dave    ((while looking at book)) Vic- (.) er::m, Henry a::nd (.5) ((turns 1 \n            briefly to Oliver)) Oliver  said they wanna go cycling w- once a  2 \n            month, is that alright.=. 3 \n    Henry   =yeah, month yeah:.  4 \n    Dave    yeah? ((nods) 5 \n            [            (2.0 silence until line 11             ] 6 \n    Dave    [(( looks down at book)) 7 \n\u2192  Dom    [ ((puts thumbs up with both hands and pushes them forward  8 \n\u2192          emphatically over table, then drops hands down \u2013Dave does  9 \n\u2192          not see it))] 10 \n    Dave    all enjoy(n) going ((looks up at Henry)) to the dis'bility sports  11 \n            [club every:= 12 \n\u2192  Dom     [((thumbs up with left hand towards Dave who does not see him)) 13 \n    Dave    =two weeks?

(.) is that alright (( looks at Victor)) Victor? (.) football? 17 \n    Victor   yeah ((nods)).   18 \n \nRecall that the business in hand at this point is the round-robin check that \neveryone is happy with the arrangements to go cycling. We join at the point where \nDave is summarising the position. He then looks to Henry for his opinion (line 2). \nHenry says yeah, month, yeah, which Dave receipts with a yeah? and a nod, then \nlooks back down to his notes. \nAt this point, Dominic makes an emphatic exaggerated gesture of 'thumbs up' \nwith both hands (see figure 2), stretching his arms across the table towards Dave, and \ngiving a final 'kick' at their outwardmost extension. But Dave does not see this. \nDominic then pulls his hands back and drops them under the table.  \n \n[----------------- figure 2 about here ------------------------]  \n \nNote again that, from Dominic's point of view, the contribution is well-timed, \ncoming after Dave's confirmation of Henry's positive response. The conventional \n'thumbs up' gesture is semantically and pragmatically appropriate as some sort of echo \nor endorsement of Henry's positive evaluation of the cycling activity, or of Dave's \nsuccessful receipt of it. Alternatively, it could be relevant not to the immediately \ncontiguous material (Henry and Dave's exchange) but to the issue that may still be \nexercising Dominic from his own earlier unsatisfactory exchange with Dave. It might \nbe an indication of his own positive evaluation of the notion of cycling. Since it is not \nnoticed, however, it is not treated as either of these things, either of which would \nrepresent a substantial contribution. \nA few lines later in the episode, Dave - unaware of Dominic's first thumbs-up - \nopens a new question to \u2018all\u2019 residents (All enjoyed going to the disability sports club \nevery two weeks). Once again Dom signals 'thumbs up' (with just one hand this time). \nAgain, this may be a direct response to Dave's question, or a reiteration of unfinished \nbusiness, either to do with the exchange between Henry and Dave, or the earlier \nexchange between Dave and Dominic.  However, although the gesture may be just \nwithin Dave's line of sight, it is not noticed and remains enigmatic. \n \nEpisode 5: Dom's objection to an activity \nOn not being noticed      19   \nIn this extract, Dave is soliciting views on the activity of going to the cinema. \nAt the same time, one of the residents, Alec, is addressing questions to Chris on the \nprevious topic discussed, which was holidays (e.g. \u2018where\u2019s France?). Note what \nhappens and line 7, where Dominic makes a contribution. \n \nExtract 5: VD03,  7.10 \"Cinema\" \n    Dave   Cinema?

We might consider how it could reasonably have been treated at the time. \nThe first brief head shake could have been a objection to the activity proposed to \nfellow-resident Alec, either from Dominic's own point of view, or perhaps on Alec's \nbehalf. But when Dominic repeats the gesture more emphatically, with hand-\nmovements, Dave is now talking to Victor. Again it might be an objection to the \nactivity proposed to Victor, from Dominic or Victor's point of view. Once more we \nsee Dom making a potentially significant contribution (objecting to something either \nOn not being noticed      20   \nfor his own part, or on behalf of others) at an appropriate place in the interaction. If it \nwere treated in these ways, Dominic would be seen trying to influence Victor  and \nAlec (not to go to the club) or the staff (not to take them), or as someone who dislikes \nthe club and is stating his own preference. All autonomous, empowered activities, but \nall unrealized in this instance. \n \nEpisode 6: Dom summons Henry \nIn the extract below we see Dom using gesture for a different purpose \u2013 that of \ncalling another resident to attention. Dave has been going around the group asking \neach person whether they want to go to a particular club where there is music and \ndrinking. We join them as Dave is half-way through asking Dom if he wants to go. \nAlec is again participating in a different conversation to the one that Dom, Henry and \nDave are engaged in. His questions are directed at Chris. \n \nExtract 6: 8.55  \"Music, drinking\" \n    Dave   ((to Dom)) Music (.) drinking (.) ((one hand makes drinking 1 \n            gesture)). 2 \n             (.3) 3 \n    Dom    [((nods and makes quick drink movement\/pointing)). 4 \n    Alec    [((to Chris)) ( Chris you-    ) Chris (you doin' it?) 5 \n     Dave   ((turns to Henry and points to him, drops hand quickly)) Henry, 6 \n    Henry   ((does not react - drinking from cup, looking into it, not looking  7 \n          at Dave \u2013    appears not to have have heard his name))  8 \n  \u2192 Dom   [((brings hand up above table and points at Henry)) 9 \n    Alec    [((to Chris)) play darts  10 \n    Henry   ((looks up at Dave and puts cup down)) 11 \n    Dave    do you want to go tomorrow night? 12 \n    Henry  ((nods)) 13 \n \n(-------------- insert Fig 3 about here ----------------) \n \nWhen Dave says \u2018Henry\u2019, looks and briefly points at him, Henry is drinking \nfrom a plastic cup and is not looking at Dave. There is a short pause, during which \nAlec continues to talk to Chris. Dom, who is sitting next to Henry, points at Henry. \nOn not being noticed      21   \nNote that this pointing occurs after Dave has used Henry\u2019s name to gain his attention, \nand after Dave has also pointed briefly at him. Henry, who is looking into his cup and \ndrinking, has not replied. Viewed sequentially, we could see it as a repeated indication  \n(though a non-verbal one) of who is to speak next. After Dom points at him, Henry \nlooks up at Dave, who finishes the question. Whether or not Henry\u2019s attention was \nattracted by Dom\u2019s pointing is unclear, but where it was placed, and its potential \nfunction, appear to be competently designed as part of the interaction. If Dom\u2019s \ncontribution is registered, we see him acting in terms of a facilitator, both helping \nHenry by alerting him that he has been called to speak, and aiding in the smooth \nprogress of the meeting. \n \nEpisode 7: Dom's gesture acknowledged: Guinness man \nWe end with an episode that, unlike most of the others, does indeed show a staff \nmember reacting to a gesture. This demonstrates how rich implications can be drawn \nfrom such contributions, if they are noticed and ratified. It comes during a stretch \nwhen Dave is asking each resident in turn whether they are still going to the sports \nclub and doing different activities there. He uses gestures to indicate several of the \nactivities he is asking about. \n \nExtract 7: 6.30: \"Guinness man\" \n    Dave   Oliver, (1.5) ((leans towards and looks at him)) are you still  1 \n           doing the ((moves hand in grasping\/ pushing gesture))  2 \n           [curling, (.) yeah? 3 \n    Alec   [d\u2019you like  football Chris? 4 \n           (1.0)  5 \n    Dave   ((turns to Alec)) Alec,  [(.) you           [still doing the  6 \n    Alec                       [((looks at Dave))   [ehye::ah 7 \n    Dave   curling?

He points at Chris. Instead of \ndismissing this as irrelevant as he did in extract three, Dave now attempts to make it \nrelevant to the outing in question by asking \u2018Do you want to go with Chris\u2019.  \nAs in extract 3, Dom does not explicitly confirm or deny Dave\u2019s candidate \nunderstanding, but instead makes a gesture that Dave interprets as indicating the pub. \nThe gesture is acknowledged by Dave, Chris treats it as an invitation, which he \naccepts, and Brenda bestows the identity of Guinness Man on Dominic. Here we see \nthe potential when non-verbal gestures are acknowledged, and how meaning is \nproduced jointly between the staff and residents (Beamer & Brooks, 2001; Edge, \nOn not being noticed      23   \n2001; Harris, 2003). Dominic\u2019s gestures are treated as meaningful, and in the process \nhe is treated as having particular identities (as contributing meaningfully to the topic, \nas host, as Guinness man). In addition, as in all the extracts above, Dom\u2019s \ncontributions are placed appropriately in the interaction in transition relevant places. \nIn the first case, in response to Dave\u2019s question, in the second as a further \nsuggestion\/invitation (the pub) after Dave has confirmed Chris might come on Friday. \n \nDiscussion \nOur aim in this article was to throw the spotlight on the kind of subtle (and \nsometimes not so subtle) gestures that a person with intellectual disabilities might use \n(as anyone might) to make a point during a meeting. We showed an occasion where \nthe gestures were registered by the staff members in the meeting and made \nconsequential (extract 7 ); but we showed six other occasions on which gestures were \nnot seen or registered. In each of those misfiring occasions, good sense might have \nbeen made of the resident's performance if the gestures had been responded to and \nclarified. These examples provide evidence for recommendations made elsewhere that \nstaff working in services for people with intellectual disabilities should become more \naware of, and responsive to, non-verbal behaviours (e.g. Houghton et al, 1987; \nMcConkey et al, 1999). \nFirst a word on interactional competence. Conversation analysts use the term \n'intersubjectivity' to refer to the way interactants display their understanding to each \nother and how they orient to the shared activity in which they are engaged (see the \ndiscussion in Heritage, 1984, especially pp 254-60; for a discussion of this in relation \nto intellectual disability, see Goode, 1994). What we find here is no different. The \nunacknowledged gestures we record display an orientation to the topic or question at \nhand, and represent potentially helpful or self-determined contributions (for a \ndiscussion of unacknowledged competence with respect to verbal communication see \nRapley, 2004). In addition, they are often placed at appropriate points in the \ninteraction, in just the way spoken contributions might be. We are not suggesting that \ncontributions are not also missed in meetings involving people without disabilities; \nboth verbal and non-verbal contributions are no doubt missed in any meeting \ninvolving multiple participants. However, it is particularly important to acknowledge \nand attempt to ameliorate this in meetings involving people with communication \ndifficulties or who are less verbally assertive. Indeed, the aim of encouraging \nOn not being noticed      24   \ncitizenship and self-advocacy means that not only is it essential to be sensitive to \nevery potential type of communication, but we must also recognize how different \nforums for participation (such as formal meetings) have in-built biases towards certain \nforms of communication. Remaining vigilant to the type of gestures described here is \nparticularly important given suggestions that some people with intellectual disabilities \n(e.g. Down\u2019s syndrome) have particular problems in word articulation, and thus in \nproducing easily intelligible speech (Dodd & Thompson, 2001; Mundy, Sigman, \nKasari & Yirmiya, 1988; Rondal & Edwards, 1997). \nIt is useful to contrast the way in which Dominic\u2019s gestures are treated here to \nthe examples of gestures in Goodwin\u2019s work on aphasia (1995, 2000). While \nGoodwin illustrated the variety of ways (using intonation, gaze, body posture and \ngesture) in which a man with aphasia confirmed or rejected \u2018guessing sequences\u2019 of \nhis interactional partners in order to arrive at an agreed meaning, this was not quite so \nclear in our data. One problem of pointing as a gesture is that it can be understood in \nmultiple ways, both in terms of locations and objects indicated as well as the activities \nimplied by these objects\/locations (Goodwin, 2003). When his gestures are noticed by \nDave (extract 3) and candidate suggestions offered, Dominic tended to move on the \nnext gesture.  \nThe dilemma here for the staff member is whether to interpret these subsequent \ngestures as rephrasings of the previous gestures (indicating his guess at the word was \nwrong) or as the next meaning units in the interaction (indicating his previous guess \nwas more or less adequate). Dominic does not orient to Dave\u2019s problems because he \nneither provides third position repairs (Schegloff, 1992) nor explicit confirmations \n(nods\/\u2019yes\u2019). There is a clear problem in recipient design (e.g. Wootton, 1989), that is, \ntailoring one's interventions to the circumstances of a given interlocutor. One \nsuggestion to tackle this problem would be for staff to make Dominic aware of their \ndifficulties in piecing together meaning with him by asking questions more \nspecifically rather than providing single words \u2013 for example, they might ask \u2018Do you \nmean Brenda?\u2019 rather than just offering the word \u2018Brenda\u2019. \nA second point of contrast with Goodwin\u2019s data is that these unnoticed gestures \nare often not preceded by any call to attention. In this way they differ from the \nexamples in, for example, Goodwin et al (2002) in which a summons-answer \nsequence is used before the aphasic man produces a further gesture or vocalisation \n(for examples in children\u2019s interaction see Ochs, Schieffelin, Platt, 1979). In \nOn not being noticed      25   \nGoodwin\u2019s example, the summons is used to gain the gaze of a hearer before the \ngesture begins, and often involves prosodic features of \u2018nonsense syllables\u2019 together \nwith particular gaze\/body configurations. In most of the examples here, however, this \ndoes not occur. This might indicate that the gestures are not designed to affect the \ncourse of the interaction, being designed instead as asides or, in Goffman's terms, \n'response cries' (Goffman, 1981). In other cases, such as in extract one where Henry \nmoves his glasses right in front of Dave and then holds them up, or when Dom points \nat Henry when he does not respond, this seems less likely. However, in both these \ncases, not calling attention to their contributions when these are \u2018out of turn\u2019 seems to \ndisplay a sensitivity to the \u2018business at hand\u2019, the formal procedure of the meeting. By \nnot demanding attention, their contributions do not usurp the trajectory of the meeting \n\u2013 they are there to be picked up on if Dave or another person wishes, but they do not \ndemand to be noticed. This sensitivity reveals a delicate procedural competence \namongst the group members which we would have missed if we had not looked \ncarefully at the details of non-verbal contributions in their context. \nThere are two complementary ways of explaining how many of these potential \ncontributions were either not responded to or simply went unnoticed. One is that staff \nmay be attuned to the vocal register. Many of the contributions described here were \nnot accompanied by calls to attention which \u201cactively work to secure the orientation \nof a hearer\u201d (Goodwin, 2000, p1499). This puts a particular onus on the other people \npresent to be vigilant to such silent, and unassertive, contributions. The other \nexplanation is that the staff face a dilemma (Houghton et al, 1987; McConkey et al, \n1999). If a resident's gesture is only vaguely noted or has a meaning that is difficult to \ndiscern, then the staff member must calculate the costs and benefits of pursuing it \nuntil its meaning and relevance are clear, or, conversely, pressing on with the matter \nin hand (i.e. addressing each agenda item and recording decisions). Pursuing gestural \ncontributions can be time-consuming and the outcome debatable: we often observed \nstaff make repeated attempts to clarify their meaning, particularly when the candidate \nwords suggested by members of staff were not clearly accepted or rejected. In other \ncases part of the contribution was neglected and only the clearest sign taken up (e.g. a \npointing gesture).  \nThis study has important implications for how we understand the identities of \nthe actors in these settings. The impression one would get if one were to analyse the \nvocal transcript of these interactions is that, except for one resident who regularly \nOn not being noticed      26   \ninitiated verbal interactions (Alec), the other residents were present only when \naddressed directly by the staff and prompted towards making a reply. We would find \npeople lacking in spontaneity and agency, able only to format communications and \nparticipate in interactions once lead by someone more able. Just as Goode (1994) \nfound that formal assessments of communication were too limited to provide a picture \nof the real-world interactional abilities of the deaf-blind children in his study, a \nreliance on the verbal record here would have produced a version of the residents as \nreactive, autonomous only when asked direct questions. However, looking at non-\nverbal behaviour provides a different picture of their identities in this context; it \nshows the residents as spontaneous, autonomous and as having a delicate sensitivity \nto the procedural aspects of the meeting. The examples here, then, provide further \nillustrations of the social model of disability (e.g. Goodley, 2000; Oliver, 1990), \nwhich attempts to show how people are disabled by the ways in which the social \nenvironment is structured and institutions go about their business. Conducting \nmeetings in such a way that they are not sensitive to non-verbal contributions, and in \nwhich there is a pressure to overlook \u2018out of turn\u2019 contributions, in effect disables \npeople by insisting that they contribute in ways that may be difficult for them. Not \nonly is incompetence produced by the way in which the meeting is organised, but \nfurther obstacles are put in the way of participation and self-determination. A clear \nrecommendation from this study is that meetings need to be structured differently, so \nthat deviations from the procedure are welcomed and non-verbal contributions \nnoticed. Having a second member of staff at the meeting whose role is to watch for \nthese would be useful. \nThere is a more general point here concerning language and identities as they \nare studied in the social sciences. There is a disciplinary emphasis on describing or \nextrapolating identities from written or spoken data (questionnaires, interviews, talk-\nin-interaction), partly because language is the tool of the analyst for describing their \nideas and findings, and partly because it is the easiest method of data collection. But \nthis presents a problem for how we should understand the notion of identity for those \nwith limited access to language. The cumulative impression one might get from \nresearch on identity in the social sciences is that identity is only found in language \u2013 \nto a certain extent, lacking a vocabulary, at least for the analyst, means lacking an \nidentity. However, following Goode\u2019s (1994) discussion of identity in his study of \ndeaf-blind children, if we conceive of identity as something that can be seen in how \nOn not being noticed      27   \npeople treat one another (for example in positioning theory and in conversation \nanalysis), without dealing with the question of what people actually think of \nthemselves or others, then more potential is opened up for understanding identities as \nthings that are interactionally significant. But we must not then carry over the \ntendency to rely on verbal language. To expand the possibilities even further for those \nwithout language we must attend to what goes on non-verbally \u2013 and notice both \nthose contributions that become interactionally salient as well as those that do not.  \nWhen we notice these silent contributions a different picture of identity \nemerges. Admittedly these are often not identities that become interactionally salient \nfor the other actors at the time. Rather these contributions can be seen as the basis for \npotential identities. The contributions we observed here are often much richer than \ntheir translation by the staff into language. They are there for the taking, and if taken \nin their complexity, give a different picture of the residents. They are assertions, \nevaluations, jokes and prosocial behaviours that if responded to would result in \ninteractional identities that are more autonomous and self-directed; identities that \nmight be available and ascribed to actors in more relaxed social contexts, in which \nthere is not the same emphasis on achieving interactional business. It is worth \ntherefore sounding a cautionary note with regard to context. An analysis of \nprogramme planning meetings yields only a partial account of the identities available \nto the residents across the scope of their regular activities and interactions.  \nWhere members of staff are not focused on achieving institutional business and \nefficiently managing meetings they can, and do expend greater effort in discerning the \nmeanings of ambiguous utterances or signs. One example from the ethnographic \nrecord of this research illustrates this point. One day, seemingly out of the blue, Alec \ninformed Kath (the home manager) that he was scared of falling in the airport and was \nlikely to cry. After considerable effort, Kath was able to establish that Alec did not \nwant to fly to Spain this year but preferred to holiday in the UK; a choice ratified at \nsubsequent programme planning meetings. Though self-advocacy and programme \nmeetings are important locations for choice and the production of empowered \nidentities, in order to enact truly person-centred practices, staff in services must \nremain alert to choice and identity as ongoing interactional concerns and remain \nflexible in their practices in order to engage with them wherever and whenever they \nmight arise.  \n \nOn not being noticed      28   \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe research reported was facilitated by grant number Res-148-25-0002 from the \nUnited Kingdom ESRC.
