Vaughan\n(2009), West Antarctic Rift System in the Antarctic Peninsula,\nGeophys. Res. Lett., 36, L21305, doi:10.1029\/2009GL040721.\n1. Introduction\n[2] The West Antarctic Rift System formed at a plate\nboundary that separated East and West Antarctica (Figure 1).\nObservation-based quantifications of the mobility of thermal\nplumes in the mantle depend on accurate knowledge of this\nboundary\u2019s development, and disagree prior to mid Eocene\ntimes [Steinberger et al., 2004; Tarduno et al., 2009]. The\nbase of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet lies well below sea level\nin the rift system\u2019s basins, and its consequent instability\nmakes it a key factor in past and future sea level change\n[Vaughan, 2008; Bamber et al., 2009]. Understanding the rift\nsystem\u2019s development through time is therefore important,\nand plate kinematic models are crucial to this understanding.\n[3] Direct knowledge of the rift system comes from\ngeological and geophysical surveying and drilling in the\nRoss Sea region. Late Cretaceous rifting of southern New\nZealand from Marie Byrd Land is recorded in rocks exposed\nat the margins of the Eastern Basin [e.g., Luyendyk et al.,\n2001]. On the other side of the Ross Sea, fission track\nanalyses betray later unroofing of the Transantarctic Moun-\ntains in Victoria Land starting at 55\u201345 Ma [Fitzgerald and\nBaldwin, 1997], andmagnetic anomalies in the Adare Trough\nrecord seafloor spreading in the period 43\u201326 Ma [Cande\net al., 2000]. Strata seen on seismic data from the Central,\nNorthern, and Victoria Land basins are interpreted as dating\nfrom this period [Cande and Stock, 2004a, 2006], and coring\nto the base of the Victoria Land Basin returned sediments\nwith a maximum age of 34 Ma [Wilson et al., 1998; Hannah\net al., 2001]. Sub-ice topography maps show that the rift\nsystem continues eastwards between the Transantarctic\nMountains andMarie Byrd Land as far as the Byrd Subglacial\nBasin [Lythe et al., 2001]. Beyond this, although the Trans-\nantarctic Mountains continue to the northeast, it is not clear\nfrom surveying within Antarctica where the plate boundary\nlies and what form it takes.\n2. Plate Kinematic Models for the West Antarctic\nRift System\n[4] Despite being very short, the spreading anomalies in\nthe Adare Trough are confidently dated because they form\nparts of prominent magnetic bights in seafloor around the\ntriple junction of the Australian, East and West Antarctic\nplates [Cande and Stock, 2006].Cande et al. [2000] used data\nfrom the bights to close the circuit of those plates, giving\nEuler parameters that describe the orientation and separation\nof the Adare Trough anomalies. Mu\u00a8ller et al. [2007] used a\nlonger circuit involving the Australia\u2013Pacific plate boundary\nin the Macquarie and Emerald basins south of New Zealand\n[Keller, 2004], and also reproduced the Adare Trough record.\nAlthough the resulting stage pole falls within the 95% con-\nfidence ellipse of Cande et al.\u2019s [2000] stage pole (Figure 1),\nthe two are separated by over 5000 km, and yield very\ndifferent models of the eastern end of the East-West Antarctic\nplate boundary. Mu\u00a8ller et al.\u2019s [2007] stage pole predicts a\ntranscurrent boundary, whereasCande et al.\u2019s [2000] predicts\nfurther extensional basins.\n[5] Unlike the southern offshore reaches of the East\nAfrican Rift, where it hosts its own instantaneous motion\npole [Chu and Gordon, 1999], both stage poles require the\neastern parts of the East-West Antarctic plate boundary to\nhave accommodated significant relative motion (Figure 1).\nBecause of this, it is most likely to have terminated at a triple\njunction with another active plate boundary. The nearest of\nthese was at the western margin of the Antarctic Peninsula\nwhere the oceanic Phoenix plate was subducting [Larter and\nBarker, 1991]. Various Cenozoic basins are known from this\nmargin. In the following, we show how the formation of one\nof them, George VI Sound (GVIS), might be related to exten-\nsion in the West Antarctic Rift System.\n3. Extension and Transtension in George VI\nSound\n[6] The 800 m deep north-striking arm of GVIS separates\nthe largely sedimentary Fossil Bluff Group of Alexander\nIsland from the intruded metamorphic basement of Palmer\nLand and probably originated as a terrane boundary in Creta-\nceous times [Ferraccioli et al., 2006; Vaughan and Storey,\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 36, L21305, doi:10.1029\/2009GL040721, 2009\n1Department of Earth Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London,\nEgham, UK.\n2British Antarctic Survey, High Cross, Cambridge, UK.\n3Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven,\nGermany.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/09\/2009GL040721\nL21305 1 of 4\n2000]. Structural studies show that this boundary ultimately\nevolved into a basin that opened in dextral transtension\n[Storey and Nell, 1988], which may have started around\n40\u201335 Ma as interpreted from fission track data from\nAlexander Island [Storey et al., 1996]. Gravity modeling\nimplies a stretching factor of \u00021.3 [Maslanyj, 1988]. A free-\nair (Figure 2) and Bouguer gravity low suggests the basin\ncontinues north across the shelf north of Alexander Island\nwhere it is namedGeorgeVI trough [Johnson, 1997;McAdoo\nand Laxon, 1997]. The trough merges opposite the Tula\nFracture Zone, via a discrete step in Bouguer gravity, with a\nmargin-parallel sedimentary basin on the continental shelf\n[Larter et al., 1997; Johnson, 1997]. The east-striking\nsouthern arm is wider and deeper; here a simple gravity\nmodel implies a stretching factor of \u00021.5, consistent with\nformation by lower-obliquity extension than in the northern\narm [Maslanyj, 1987, 1988]. Volcanic activity resulting from\nthis much stretching may explain the large positive magnetic\nanomalies observed along the southern arm [Golynsky et al.,\n2001].\n[7] Given the timing of these processes and their position\nbetween the Byrd Subglacial Basin and formerly active\nAntarctic Peninsula margin (Figure 1), it is conceivable that\nGVIS formed a segment of theWest Antarctic Rift System. If\nso, the distinctive transtensional and extensional tectonics\nshould obey the constraints of a rotation pole for relative\nmotions between East andWest Antarctica. This is indeed the\ncase with Cande et al.\u2019s [2000] pole, which prescribes a\nNNW translation of Alexander Island away from Palmer\nLand (Figure 2). With the margins of the stretched region\ntaken to be beneath ice covered scarps in Palmer Land, and\nalong the LeMay Range Fault in Alexander Island [Crabtree\net al., 1985], stretching factors like those Maslanyj [1988]\nmodeled require a rotation of \u00020.7\u0002 about this pole. Assum-\ning stretching occurred on the extensional arm of a ridge-\ntrench-fault triple junction, its onset can be dated to a ridge-\ncrest\u2013trench collision SWof the Tula Fracture Zone at 30.1 \u00b1\n3 Ma [Larter et al., 1997].

[2007] interpret a dominantly\ntranscurrent East Antarctica\u2013West Antarctica boundary in\nand offshore of the Antarctic Peninsula. The interpretation is\nbased on a grid of crustal stretching factors calculated using\nsub ice topography and sediment thickness data [Lythe et al.,\n2001; Laske and Masters, 1997]. Examination of the sub ice\ntopography data set reveals that depths in GVIS are errone-\nously depicted some 600\u2013800 m shallower than have been\nmeasured seismically [Maslanyj, 1987; Bell and King, 1998].\nUsing more appropriate depths of 800\u20131000 m, Mu\u00a8ller\net al.\u2019s [2007] method of calculating crustal stretching factors\nreturns values of 1.50\u20131.64, similar to the results of grav-\nity modelling, consistent with an extensional eastern West\nAntarctic Rift System.\n4. Accuracy in the South Pacific Plate Circuit\n[9] This interpretation of GVIS is persuasive in its sim-\nplicity. Accepting it, however, draws attention back to the fact\nthat the South Pacific plate circuit yields very different East\nAntarctica\u2013West Antarctica rotations when constructed with\nthe Pacific\u2013Australia rotations of Keller [2004]. Figure 3\nillustrates that the differences are artifacts of those rotations\nby using Cande et al.\u2019s [2000] East Antarctica\u2013West Ant-\narctica rotation along with Australia\u2013East Antarctica and\nPacific\u2013West Antarctica rotations [Cande and Stock, 2004b;\nCroon et al., 2008] to predict Pacific\u2013Australia motion\nindependently ofKeller\u2019s [2004] data. The resulting rotations\ncannot be compared quantitatively to Keller\u2019s [2004] as\nCande et al. [2000] did not provide formal error estimates\nthat would enable us to calculate a set of confidence ellipses.\nNonetheless, the circuit-derived finite poles produce synthet-\nic flowline orientations that are qualitatively almost identical\nboth to Keller\u2019s [2004] and to fracture zone traces in free-air\ngravity data.\n[10] The artifacts arise from the magnification of small\ninaccuracies in the Pacific\u2013Australia parameters through\ntheir large rotation angles. Despite being small, these inac-\ncuracies are evidently larger than might be expected from\nKeller\u2019s [2004] error analysis (Figure 3), and so must be\nattributed to factors he did not consider for it. Amongst these\nfactors, we note that some of Keller\u2019s [2004] data occupy a\nbroad zone of post-Pliocene deformation attributed to incip-\nient subduction south of New Zealand [Cande and Stock,\n2004b; Hayes et al., 2009]. These data are not likely to\ndescribe relative motions between the Pacific and Australian\nplates as completely as they would have done if they had not\nexperienced this deformation.\n5. Cenozoic Motion Between East and West\nAntarctica\n[11] Sixty percent of Cande et al.\u2019s [2000] modeled post-\n43 Ma West Antarctica\u2013East Antarctica motion would have\nbeen expressed prior to and away from the extension in\nGVIS. By analogy, one can hypothesise a rift basin connect-\ning the precursor to the \u2018Tula\u2019 triple junction, which existed\nsince 43 Ma at the SE end of the Alexander Fracture\nZone (Figure 2) [Larter et al., 1997; Scheuer et al., 2006].\nAlthough the fission track evidence from Alexander Island\n[Storey et al., 1996] is consistent with this timing, evidence\nfor the presence of the basin itself is not overwhelmingly\nstrong. Satellite altimetry data show a broad free-air gravity\nanomaly crossing the shelf towards the fracture zone. Despite\na smooth sedimented seafloor, reverberations in seismic\ndata mask any indication of how deep beneath the anomaly\nthe sediments continue, except near the east coast of Smyley\nIsland [Nitsche, 1998]. A positive magnetic anomaly at\n\u000279\u0002Wmight be interpreted in terms of an uplifted rift flank\n(Figure 2). High smectite concentrations in sediments from\nthe Ronne Entrance suggest the presence of volcanic or\nvolcaniclastic rocks, perhaps related to rifting, at the seabed\n[Hillenbrand et al., 2009].\n[12] Before 43 Ma, reconstruction misfits between Lord\nHoweRise and Campbell Plateau suggest even earlier motion\nbetween East and West Antarctica [Cande and Stock, 2004a;\nSteinberger et al., 2004]. Although it has been suggested that\nthis motion created some of the basins of the Ross Sea, there\nis no firmly-established record of it there in the form of cored\nor sampled Paleocene or older Eocene sediments. Added to\nthis, there is no evidence for basins connecting to pre-43 Ma\ntriple junctions off Eltanin Bay, where they might be\nexpected (Figure 2). While this absence of evidence is no\nbasis on which to dismiss the idea of Paleocene relative\nmotions between West and East Antarctic plates, it should be\ntaken as a reminder that that idea, while intuitively attractive,\nremains only indirectly proved and should be applied with\ncaution.\n6. Conclusion\n[13] The geology of the GVIS region can be interpreted in\nterms of the eastern reaches of an extensional West Antarctic\nRift System. The interpretation reinforces the already strong\nFigure 3. Results of interrogating the South Pacific circuit\nfor Pacific\u2013Australia motions.

This interpretation further implies\nthat the Antarctic Peninsula has been part of a stable East\nAntarctic plate since mid Eocene times, and that additional\nrift basins exist in Ellsworth Land, linking GVIS and the\nByrd Subglacial Basin, where elevated heat flow is likely to\nhave influenced ice sheet development and stability.\n[14] Acknowledgments.
