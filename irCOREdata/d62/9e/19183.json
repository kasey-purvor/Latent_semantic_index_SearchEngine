The \u03bb-Red system consists of\nthree proteins, the gam, exo and bet gene products. When\nexpressed in the cell the Gam protein protects linear dou-\nble stranded DNA from degradation by the host RecBCD\ncomplex. The Exo protein generates single stranded DNA\noverhangs, which are substrates for recombination, cata-\nlyzed by the Bet protein, with homologous regions of the\nchromosome [2-7].\nSeveral \u03bb-Red recombineering techniques have been\ndeveloped: Two in particular are of note, which differ in\nthe way that the target DNA is delivered into the cell. The\nfirst technique, and arguably the most widely used, was\nfirst described by Murphy [5] and later refined by Dat-\nsenko and Wanner [2]. In this method a plasmid is used\nto express the \u03bb-Red genes from an arabinose inducible\npromoter. Strains expressing \u03bb-Red are transformed, by\nelectroporation, with a dsDNA PCR product carrying an\nantibiotic cassette flanked by short regions of homology\nto the target gene. \u03bb-Red mediated recombination occurs,\nresulting in replacement of the targeted gene by an antibi-\notic resistance cassette. This cassette can then be excised by\nFLP recombinase leaving a ~ 80 bp DNA scar in place of\nthe target gene.\nThe second technique, \"gene gorging\", designed by Her-\nring and co-workers [4], is a two plasmid method that also\nutilizes the \u03bb-Red system to generate recombinants. Gene\ngorging eliminates the need to electroporate a dsDNA\nfragment into cells, by supplying the regions of homology\nto the target gene on a donor plasmid that also contains a\nDNA recognition site for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae I-SceI\nendonuclease. The donor plasmid and the recombineer-\ning plasmid, pACBSR (which carries the \u03bb-Red and I-SceI\nendonuclease genes, under the control of an araBAD pro-\nmoter), are transformed into the recipient strain. Upon\narabinose induction, I-SceI cleaves the donor plasmid,\nproviding a linear dsDNA target for the \u03bb-Red system. The\nobvious advantage of this system is that multiple copies of\nthe homologous DNA are present in the bacterial cell,\nwhich increases the number of potential recombination\nevents. The frequency of recombination for gene gorging\nis reported to be 1-15%, eliminating the absolute require-\nment for an antibiotic resistance marker to select for\nrecombinants.\nWe have used both systems for making gene knockouts\nand gene fusions in laboratory E. coli strains. However, we\nhave had less success with these methods in pathogenic\nstrains such as the O157:H7 Sakai strain [8], and virtually\nno success in the CFT073 UPEC [9], the O42 EAEC [10]\nand the H10407 ETEC [11] strains. Since techniques such\nas transduction by P1 phage are incompatible with many\npathogenic strains, due to extensive surface antigens that\nblock access to the phage receptor [12], gene deletions\nhave to be made directly in the strain.\nOur aim in this study was to establish a high-throughput\nrecombineering system, with particular emphasis on the\nability to couple epitope tags to genes, which is compati-\nble, without modification, for use in a wide range of lab-\noratory and wild-type E. coli strains. We have achieved this\nby enhancing the two-plasmid system of Herring and co-\nworkers, making three key modifications. First, a set of\ndonor plasmids have been generated that readily facilitate\nthe deletion of genes or the C-terminal coupling of genes\nto epitope tags. Second, the inclusion of the sacB gene on\nthe donor plasmid allows for the counter-selection of all\nbut true recombinants. Third, the inclusion of an I-SceI\nrecognition site on a derivative of the recombineering\nplasmid, called pACBSCE means that the plasmid is effec-\ntively 'self-cleaving' upon induction of I-SceI and \u03bb Red\ngenes. Hence cells receive a burst of \u03bb-Red before pACB-\nSCE is lost, which is sufficient to induce recombination\nbut limits the exposure of cells to \u03bb-Red function. Pro-\nlonged exposure to \u03bb-Red activity is undesirable as it can\ncause unwanted secondary chromosomal modifications\nin both K-12 and pathogenic E. coli strains [13-15]. We\nhave termed this method Gene Doctoring, abbreviated to\nG-DOC (Gene Deletion Or Coupling), and we have dem-\nonstrated its versatility by deleting and coupling genes to\nepitope tags in pathogenic and laboratory E. coli strains.\nResults and Discussion\nCurrent techniques for recombineering in laboratory and \npathogenic Escherichia coli strains\nA. electroporation of linear DNA fragments\nThe method first described by Murphy [5], later refined by\nDatsenko and Wanner [2], of electroporating linear dou-\nble stranded DNA fragments into cells that are then targets\nfor homologous recombination by the \u03bb-Red system, is\nreported to promote a very low recombination efficiency\nin E. coli K-12 strains: approximately 1 in every 3.5 \u00d7 106\nE. coli K-12 MG1655 cells that survive electroporation [4].\nDespite this low frequency, we routinely identify between\n10-50 MG1655 recombinants per experiment, however,\nsince we use approximately 1 \u00d7 109 MG1655 cells per elec-\ntroporation [16], the identification of only 10-50 recom-\nbinants indicates that in our hands the recombination\nefficiency is approximately 1 in every 3.5 \u00d7 107 cells, 10\ntimes less than reported.\nDespite consistently attaining recombinants in MG1655\nusing this system we have had virtually no success in path-\nogenic strains. Since the low recombination frequency ofPage 2 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Microbiology 2009, 9:252 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2180\/9\/252the system has been attributed to the inefficient uptake of\nlinear dsDNA fragments during electroporation [4], we\ndetermined whether the inefficiency of this system for\nrecombination in pathogenic strains was due to a reduced\ncapacity to uptake DNA by electroporation. Thus, we\ncompared the transformation frequencies of MG1655,\nO42, CFT073 and O157:H7 Sakai cells when transformed\nby electroporation with different plasmids. Cells in the\nexponential phase of growth were transformed by electro-\nporation as previously described [2] with either: pUC18\n[17], 2,700 bp (high copy number plasmid), conferring\nampicillin resistance; pKD46 [2], 6,300 bp (medium copy\nnumber), conferring ampicillin resistance; pACBSR [4],\n7,300 bp (medium copy number), conferring chloram-\nphenicol resistance; pRW50 [18], 16,500 bp (low copy\nnumber), conferring tetracycline resistance. Cells were\nthen plated onto Lennox broth (LB) agar plates supple-\nmented with appropriate antibiotics, incubated for 20\nhours at 37\u00b0C and the number of colonies counted. Table\n1 shows the transformation frequencies of the pathogenic\nstrains by each plasmid, expressed as a percentage of the\ntransformation frequency of MG1655. It is clear that the\ntransformation frequencies of the pathogenic strains are\ndramatically lower than for MG1655, particularly for\nstrains CFT073 and O42. Considering that we expect\napproximately 10-50 recombinants in MG1655, such low\nelectroporation efficiencies could explain why using this\ntechnique in pathogenic strains results in minimal suc-\ncess.\nSince the Datsenko and Wanner system relies upon the\nintroduction of PCR generated DNA into cells and not\nplasmids that have been isolated from an E. coli K-12\nstrain, we re-examined the DNA uptake efficiencies of the\nstrains when transformed with a PCR generated version of\nthe plasmid, pUC18. We reasoned that plasmids isolated\nfrom a K-12 strain may be subject to host restriction-mod-\nification systems in pathogenic strains, hence, using a\nPCR-generated pUC18 derivative would not only more\nclosely resemble the conditions used by Datsenko and\nWanner, but also allow us to monitor the transformation\nefficiencies by means of the acquired ampicillin resistance\ndue to pUC18 plasmid uptake. Thus, we amplified pUC18\nby PCR and then incubated the reaction with DpnI, which\nspecifically digested the methylated template plasmid and\nnot the PCR generated product. The PCR generated\npUC18 plasmid (pUC18PCR) was then transformed into\nMG1655, CFT073, O157:H7 Sakai and O42 by electropo-\nration. The results (table 1) show that the transformation\nfrequency of the pathogenic strains by pUC18PCR was\nslightly improved when compared with MG1655,\nalthough the overall transformation frequency remains\nfar lower than MG1655. The overall number of MG1655\ncolonies identified after transformation with pUC18 or\npUC18PCR was comparable. Thus, the electroporation\nstep is likely to be the primary reason for the poor effi-\nciency of this system in pathogenic E. coli strains. This\nshortcoming was alleviated somewhat by Murphy and\nCampellone [15] who developed an improved electropo-\nration based protocol for recombineering in E. coli EHEC\nand EPEC strains. However, we have had mixed success\nusing this protocol, particularly when recombineering in\nEAEC and UPEC strains, where no increase in recombina-\ntion frequency was observed.\nB. Two-plasmid recombineering\nThe two plasmid gene-gorging method described by Her-\nring and co-workers [4] has an immediate advantage for\nrecombineering in pathogenic strains since the method\ndoes not rely upon efficient electroporation as a means of\nintroducing target DNA into the cell. Instead, the target\nDNA is flanked by recognition sites for the meganuclease\nI-SceI on a donor plasmid that is transformed into cells\nalong with the recombineering plasmid, pACBSR, which\ncarries I-SceI and the \u03bb-Red genes whose expression is con-\ntrolled by an arabinose inducible promoter. Induction of\nI-SceI results in donor plasmid cleavage, generating the\nlinear dsDNA target, which is a substrate for \u03bb-Red gene\nproducts. Herring and co-workers disrupted chromo-\nsomal genes by introducing amber mutations, using long\nregions of homology to the chromosome and reported\nthat the recombination frequency for gene gorging was\nbetween 1-15%.\nTo introduce epitope tags at the carboxyl terminus of\nchromosomal genes and, crucially, to maintain a high-\nthroughput system, we chose to amplify the epitope tag by\nPCR using oligonucleotide primers that contained 40 bp\nof homology to the chromosomal gene of interest, rather\nthan sequentially cloning regions of homology to either\nside of the epitope tag. We reasoned that since short\nhomologous sequences had already been successfully uti-\nlised for recombineering by Datsenko and Wanner, [2]\nthis strategy could be adapted for epitope tagging. The\namplified DNA product was cloned into pBR322, modi-\nfied so that the PCR product would be flanked by two rec-\nognition sites for I-SceI. The resulting construct was co-\ntransformed, along with pACBSR, into MG1655 cells and\ngene gorging experiments performed as described by Her-\nring and co-workers [4]. The results of the experiments\nTable 1: Electroporation efficiencies of E. coli strains\nMG1655 O157:H7 Sakai CFT073 O42\npUC18 100 15 3 0.15\npKD46 100 5 2 0.26\npACBSR 100 2.8 1.5 0\npRW50 100 1.2 1.1 0\npUC18PCR 100 57 15 1Page 3 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Microbiology 2009, 9:252 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2180\/9\/252(not shown) indicated that the recombination efficiency\nusing short regions of homology was very poor; several\nhundred colonies recovered after gene gorging were\nscreened by PCR and the frequency of recombination was\nfound to be 0.01-0.05%, far less than the 1-15% reported\nby Herring and co-workers.\nTo improve the identification rate of recombinants we\nmodified the technique by including a kanamycin cassette\nadjacent to the epitope tag on the pBR322 based donor\nplasmid. We reasoned that after in vivo digestion of the\ndonor plasmid, the ampicillin cassette carried on pBR322\nwould be lost and kanamycin resistance would only be\nmaintained if a successful recombination event had\noccurred. Hence after gene gorging, cells were plated onto\nLB agar plates containing kanamycin, and the next day\ncolonies were replica plated onto LB plates containing\neither ampicillin or kanamycin. These colonies were\nscreened for candidates which were kanamycin resistant\nand ampicillin sensitive, indicative of donor plasmid loss\nand kanamycin cassette retention as a result of recombi-\nnation with the chromosome. However, this approach\nproved to be problematic, since unless the in vivo cleavage\nrate of the donor plasmid by I-SceI approaches 100% effi-\nciency, the ampicillin and kanamycin cassettes are still\npresent on the donor plasmid in the cell, since the plas-\nmid is present in multi-copy, rendering positive selection\nineffective. Typically we screened up to 30,000 colonies\nby replica plating, identifying no more than 5 colonies\nwith the correct phenotype. Taken together these results\ndemonstrate that a more effective technique, that is both\nrapid and reliable, is required to introduce epitope tags\nonto the chromosome of pathogenic E. coli strains.\nGene Doctoring\nTo address this requirement we have developed an\nenhanced version of the two-plasmid gene gorging sys-\ntem. Our method, termed Gene Doctoring (G-DOC),\nfacilitates the coupling of genes to epitope tags or the dele-\ntion of chromosomal genes and increases the rate of iden-\ntifying recombinants. We have generated a suite of pDOC\nplasmids which allow for the deletion of chromosomal\ngenes, or the coupling of chromosomal genes to a 6 \u00d7 His,\na 3 \u00d7 FLAG, a 4 \u00d7 ProteinA or a GFP tag. The pDOC plas-\nmids carry the sacB gene, which allows for the counter-\nselection of cells still harbouring donor plasmid, thus\neliminating the need for screening post recombination.\nUsing this system we routinely identify more than 100\nrecombinants per experiment in both laboratory and\npathogenic E. coli strains, using short regions of homology\nto the chromosome, thus maintaining both a high-\nthroughput and broad-range compatibility system.\nG-DOC plasmids\nThe pDOC plasmids are derived from pEX100T, a\nmedium copy number plasmid which carries ampicillin\nresistance and the B. subtilis sacB gene [19]. We have intro-\nduced different DNA sequences into the pEX100T I-SceI\nrestriction sites to create a suite of plasmids, schematic\ndiagrams of which are shown in Figure 1. The cloning\nplasmid, pDOC-C, has a large cloning region (CR)\nflanked by two I-SceI recognition sites. The DNA sequence\nof pDOC-C, from 100 bp upstream of the left-hand I-SceI\nsite to 100 bp downstream of the right-hand I-SceI site is\nshown in Figure 2, panel A. The template plasmid, pDOC-\nK, carries a kanamycin resistance cassette flanked by Flp\nrecombinase recognition sites (Flp1 and Flp2). On either\nside of this region are 2 cloning regions (CR1 and CR2).\nThe other template plasmids, pDOC-H, pDOC-F, pDOC-\nP and pDOC-G are derivatives of pDOC-K that have the\ncoding sequence for a 6 \u00d7 His, 3 \u00d7 FLAG, 4 \u00d7 Protein A and\nGFP tag respectively, immediately downstream of CR1.\nFigure 2; panel B, shows the DNA sequence common to\nall of the pDOC template plasmids, from 100 bp\nupstream of the left-hand I-SceI site to 100 bp down-\nstream of the right-hand I-SceI site. The template plasmids\ndiffer between the CR1 and FLP1 sequences: this region is\noutlined by an open box in the figure. The DNA sequence\nproceeds through CR1, along the respective DNA\nsequence for each plasmid within the open box, and into\nthe FLP1 sequence below. The plasmid pDOC-K has 30 bp\nof DNA sequence prior to FLP1. The plasmid pDOC-H has\nthe coding sequence for the 6 \u00d7 His tag and a stop codon\nfollowed by a short DNA sequence leading into the FLP1\nsite. The first 10 codons of the 3 \u00d7 FLAG, ProteinA and\nGFP tags are shown, followed by the stop codon and short\nDNA sequences leading into FLP1 site.

A schematic outline\nof the cloning strategy for generating gene deletions is\nshown in Figure 3, panel B. The clockwise primer used for\nthe PCR amplification is designed so that it contains\nbetween 25-50 bp of homology to the DNA immediately\nupstream of the start of the gene (H3), followed by 20 bp\nof sequence which anneals to the K-FWD sequence on\npDOC-K. The anti-clockwise primer is designed so that it\ncontains 25-50 bps of homology to the 3' end of the gene\n(H4) and the primer sequence P-REV. Again, the two\nprimers are designed with 5' restriction sites for cloning\nthe DNA product into pDOC-C.\nAlternatively, when longer regions of homology to the\nchromosome are required, sequential cloning steps can be\nperformed, utilising the multiple cloning sites to intro-\nduce long regions of chromosomal homology upstream\nand downstream of the kanamycin cassette and epitope\ntag. In this case we recommend sequencing the cloned\nhomology regions, post cloning and before recombineer-\ning, using priming sequences S1 and S2 (highlighted in\nFigure 2: primers D58794 and D58793).\nThe next step is to transform the pDOC donor plasmid\ninto the recipient strain with the recombineering plasmid,\nwhich expresses I-SceI and the \u03bb-Red gene products. A\nschematic protocol, outlining the key steps in generating\nrecombinants is shown in Figure 4. We have modified the\nrecombineering plasmid, pACBSR, used by Herring and\nco-workers [4] by introducing an I-SceI recognition site\nadjacent to the replication origin of the plasmid: we have\ncalled this plasmid pACBSCE. Upon arabinose induction,\na burst of I-SceI and \u03bb-Red expression occurs; I-SceI\ncleaves the donor plasmid resulting in generation of the\nsubstrate for \u03bb-Red mediated recombination. In addition,\nI-SceI also cleaves the pACBSCE recombineering plasmid,\nresulting in loss of plasmid and loss of \u03bb-Red expression,\nthus avoiding prolonged \u03bb-Red activity, which can result\nin unwanted chromosomal modification [13-15]. Recom-\nbination occurs between homologous regions on the lin-\near DNA substrate and the chromosome, transferring the\nkanamycin cassette, and in the case of gene:coupling, the\nepitope tag, onto the chromosome (Figures 3 and 4).\nRecombinant clones are selected for by growing cells on\nLB agar plates containing kanamycin and sucrose: only\nSchematic of pDOC based recombinationFigure 3\nSchematic of pDOC based recombination. PCR products are generated for gene coupling (A) or for gene deleting (B) \nand cloned into pDOC-C. Homologous regions (H1-4) on the PCR product recombine with the target gene on the chromo-\nsome.

Examination of recombinants, to ensure\nthat the correct chromosomal modification has been gen-\nerated, is achieved by amplifying the target region by PCR,\nusing primers that anneal adjacent to the homology\nregions (H1-4 in figure 3) and chromosomal check prim-\ning sequences CC1 and CC2 (Figure 2, panel B and Figure\n3). Once recombination has been confirmed, the kanamy-\ncin cassette can be excised from the chromosome using\nthe Flp recombinase sites, as described previously. [2]\nG-DOC validation\nTo test our system we designed oligonucleotides to couple\nthe rsd and yacL genes to the 3 \u00d7 FLAG epitope tag. One\nprimer contained homology to the first 7 codons of the 3\n\u00d7 FLAG sequence, 40 bp of homology to the 5' end of the\ntarget gene, excluding the stop codon, and an EcoRI\nrestriction site (primer D61350 for rsd and D61352 for\nyacL). The second primer contained homology to the P-\nREV sequence, 40 bp of homology to the chromosome,\nimmediately downstream of the target gene primer and a\nKpnI restriction site (D61351 for rsd and D61353 for\nyacL). DNA fragments generated by PCR using pDOC-F as\nG-DOC recombineeringFigure 4\nG-DOC recombineering. The pDOC donor plasmid and the recombineering plasmid pACBSCE are co-transformed into \nthe recipient strain. Arabinose induction promotes expression of the \u03bb-Red gene products and I-SceI. I-SceI generates a linear \nDNA fragment form the donor plasmid that is a substrate for recombination with the chromosome mediated by the \u03bb-Red \nsystem. Recombinants are selected by the ability to survive and grow on LB supplemented with kanamycin and sucrose.Page 8 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Microbiology 2009, 9:252 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2180\/9\/252a template were cloned into pDOC-C, which was subse-\nquently co-transformed with pACBSCE into K-12\nMG1655, EHEC O157:H7 Sakai and UPEC CFT073 cells.\nThe Gene Doctoring protocol was followed and the results\nare reported in table 2. For both genes, in all three strains,\na large number of colonies were identified with a kanamy-\ncin resistant, sucrose insensitive phenotype. After PCR\nanalysis of the relevant chromosomal region (using\nprimer pairs D57786 (CC1) and D61354, and D57785\n(CC2) and D61355 for rsd and D57786 and D61356, and\nD57785 and D61357 for yacL) the vast majority of candi-\ndates were found to be true recombinants and in each\ncase, more than 90% were sensitive to both ampicillin\nand chloramphenicol, indicating loss of both pDOC\ndonor and pACBSCE plasmids. Where a candidate was\nfound to have the wild-type form of the gene after PCR\nverification, we assumed that the kanamycin cassette had\ninserted into a different part of the chromosome, since we\nwere unable to isolate any donor plasmid DNA from cells\nusing standard plasmid isolation techniques. Hence, for\neach gene, in each strain, more than 150 recombinants\nwere identified that had the correct chromosomal modifi-\ncation and were free of the recombineering plasmid\npACBSCE.\nTo test the effectiveness of recombination using our\nrecombineering plasmid pACBSCE, compared with the\nrecombineering plasmid pACBSR, used by Herring and\nco-workers [4] we repeated the gene coupling analysis of\nthe rsd gene. The results in table 3 show that more kan-\namycin resistant, sucrose insensitive recombinants were\nidentified in each strain when pACBSR was used as the\nrecombineering plasmid, with a comparable percentage\nbeing free of pDOC donor plasmid, when compared to\nusing pACBSCE as the recombineering plasmid. However,\nvery few candidates had lost the recombineering plasmid,\nand in strain CFT073, all of the recombinant candidates\nstill carried pACBSR, thus exposing cells to the potential\neffects of excess of \u03bb-Red expression and requiring addi-\ntional steps to cure cells of the plasmid [4,13-15].\nWe have further validated the system by making several\ngene deletions in both laboratory and pathogenic strains.\nDNA fragments, generated by PCR amplification, using\npDOC-K as a template were cloned into pDOC-C, and the\nresulting donor plasmids used for gene doctoring. To date\nwe have made deletions of the rpoS, fur, flhDC and soxS\ngenes in MG1655, O157:H7 Sakai, CFT073 and H10407\nstrains (data not shown).\nFunctionality of the epitope tags\nTo examine the functionality of the epitope tags we cou-\npled each to the Lac repressor protein in MG1655. The\nexperimental details and primer design for each recombi-\nnation experiment are given in the methods section. For\neach epitope tag we identified more than 200 candidates\nthat were kanamycin resistant, sucrose insensitive. After\nverification by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing of\nthe chromosomal region (Figure 5; panel A), we tested the\nfunctionality of the epitope tags. The LacI::3 \u00d7 FLAG,\nLacI::4 \u00d7 ProteinA and LacI::GFP fusion proteins were ana-\nlyzed by Western blotting. Whole cell extracts were sepa-\nrated by SDS-PAGE and proteins transferred to\nnitrocellulose membranes, which were then probed with\nprimary antibodies specific to the tag. The membranes\nwere then washed and probed with secondary antibodies\nconjugated to horse-radish peroxidase. Figure 5; panel B,\nshows an image of the membranes after exposure to X-ray\nfilm; the fusion proteins are indicated. In a recent study\nwe validated the functionality of the LacI::3 \u00d7 FLAG fusion\nprotein by isolating DNA fragments carrying LacI binding\nsites from cells [20]. We also confirmed the fluorescence\nof the LacI::GFP fusion protein, in whole cells using fluo-\nrescent microscopy (data not shown). Finally, we tested\nthe integrity of the 6 \u00d7 His fusion proteins by isolating the\nprotein fusion by affinity purification using nickel agarose\nTable 2: Comparison of recombination efficiency of E. coli strains\nKanR SucI\n(A)\nrecombinants Plasmid free recombinants\n(B)\n% plasmid free recombinants (B\/A)\nrsd\nMG1655 249 248 232 93\nO157:H7 Sakai 193 193 184 95\nCFT073 174 170 156 90\nyacL\nMG1655 287 286 258 90\nO157:H7 Sakai 218 218 209 96\nCFT073 209 205 192 92Page 9 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Microbiology 2009, 9:252 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2180\/9\/252affinity media (Qiagen).

This method relies on homologous recombi-\nnation, mediated by the \u03bb-Red genes, of a linear DNA frag-\nment that is supplied in vivo by restriction of a pDOC\ndonor plasmid by I-SceI endonuclease. The identification\nof recombinants is highly efficient and reproducible, since\ncounter-selection using the sacB gene identifies true\nrecombinants. This eliminates the requirement for screen-\ning large numbers of candidates by PCR, which is both\ncostly and time consuming. In addition, we have made a\nTable 3: Comparison of recombination efficiency using recombineering plasmids pACBSCE and pACBSR\nKanR+SucI % free of pDOC donor plasmid % free of recombineering plasmid\nRecombineering plasmid pACBSCE pACBSR pACBSCE pACBSR pACBSCE pACBSR\nMG1655 249 320 94 93 97 9\nO157:H7 Sakai 193 308 97 99 97 3\nCFT073 174 234 91 93 99 0\nVerification and functionality of chromosomal lacI::tag fusionsFigure 5\nVerification and functionality of chromosomal lacI::tag fusions.

This system is designed to facilitate the coupling of\ngenes to epitope tags, though the deletion of genes can\nalso be readily achieved. We have demonstrated the versa-\ntility of Gene Doctoring by deleting genes in both labora-\ntory and pathogenic E. coli strains, in addition to coupling\nseveral genes to epitope tags, and we have confirmed the\nfunctionality of epitope tagged fusion proteins using bio-\nchemical methods.

The two primers were designed so\nthat 35 bp complementary overhangs remained at each 5'\nterminus of the amplicon, facilitating plasmid re-circular-\nisation pre-transformation. The restriction enzyme DpnI\nwas then added to the reaction in order to digest specifi-\ncally the methylated pUC18 template plasmid, leaving\nonly the PCR generated pUC18PCR intact.\nConstruction of the pDOC plasmids\nThe pDOC series of plasmids are based on the plasmid\npEX100T [19]. A schematic representation of the plasmids\nis shown in Figure 2 and the entire DNA sequence of each\nplasmid is provided in Additional file 1 and also on Gen-\nBank; nos.. The plasmid pDOC-F was constructed by\namplification of the 3 \u00d7 FLAG DNA sequence, Flp recom-\nbinase target sites (Flp1 and Flp2) and the kanamycin cas-\nsette from the plasmid pSUB11 [22], flanked by KpnI and\nXhoI restriction sites, using the primers D55908 and\nD55909. This amplicon was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy\ncloning vector (Promega). The resulting plasmid was then\nrestricted with AatII and KpnI, and ligated with annealed\ncomplementary oligonucleotides (D57236 and D57237),\ndesigned to introduce an I-SceI site and a multi-cloning\nregion (CR1). This plasmid was then restricted with XhoI\nand NsiI and ligated with annealed complementary oligo-\nnucleotides (D57238 and D57239), designed to intro-\nduce a second I-SceI site and a multi-cloning region\n(CR2). The resulting plasmid was restricted with I-SceI,\nand the fragment cloned into the I-SceI sites of the plas-\nmid pEX100T.\nTo facilitate further plasmid construction, the 3 \u00d7 FLAG\nDNA sequence was removed from pDOC-F, and an AgeI\nrestriction site introduced immediately downstream of\nthe KpnI site. This was achieved by PCR amplification of\nthe DNA immediately downstream of the 3 \u00d7 FLAG DNA\nsequence, flanked by KpnI and BglII restriction sites using\nprimers D57436 and D57437. This fragment was then\ncloned into the unique KpnI and BglII sites of pDOC-F,\neffectively removing the 3 \u00d7 FLAG DNA sequence. This\nnew plasmid, pDOC-K, retained the Flp recombination\ntarget sites and the kanamycin cassette.\nThe plasmid pDOC-K was restricted with KpnI and AgeI,\nand KpnI-AgeI flanked DNA harboring a 6 \u00d7 His coding\nsequence, the coding sequence of GFP (from Invitrogen\nEmerald Green GFP gateway vector - V355-20; amplified\nwith primers D59990 and D59991) or the coding\nsequence of ProteinA [23] (amplified using primers\nD57584 and D57585), were ligated. This resulted in the\ngeneration of the plasmids pDOC-H, pDOC-G and\npDOC-P respectively.\nThe plasmid pDOC-C was created by removing the Flp\nrecombinase sites and the kanamycin cassette from\npDOC-K, by digestion with KpnI-XhoI, and ligation with\nannealed complementary oligonucleotides that intro-\nduced a unique EcoRV site (D60111 and D60112).\nConstruction of pACBSCE\nPlasmid pACBSR [4] was used as a template in PCR to cre-\nate pACBSCE, using the primers D61358 and D61359,\nwhich anneal adjacent to the origin of replication.\nD61358 contains the recognition sequence for I-SceI at\nthe 5' end. The resulting linearised plasmid, carrying an I-\nSceI recognition site, was self-ligated using a Quick Liga-\ntion Kit (NEB). Circularized plasmid was transformed\ninto TOP10 cells (Invitrogen) and plated onto LB agar\nplates supplemented with chloramphenicol (35 \u03bcg\/ml).\nThe plasmid was then checked by digestion with I-SceI\nenzyme (N.E.B.), and sequenced using primer D61360.\nGene-doctoring protocol\nElectrocompetent E. coli cells were transformed with the\nrecombineering plasmid, pACBSCE, and a pDOC donor\nplasmid derivative and spread onto LB agar plates con-\ntaining 35 \u03bcg\/ml chloramphenicol (for pACBSCE) and\n200 \u03bcg\/ml ampicillin and 50 \u03bcg\/ml kanamycin (for\npDOC derivatives)(LBCAK agar plates). Colonies were rou-\ntinely tested for maintenance of the sacB gene on the\npDOC donor plasmid, by patching onto LBCAK agar plates\nand LBCAK agar plates supplemented with 5% sucrose: col-\nonies containing a functional sacB gene will be unable to\ngrow on plates supplemented with 5% sucrose. A single\nfresh sucrose sensitive colony was inoculated into 1 ml of\nLBCAK, supplemented with 0.5% Glucose, which was\nadded to prevent leaky expression of the \u03bb-Red and I-SceI\ngenes from pACBSCE. Cultures were incubated with shak-\ning at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours. Cells were harvested by centrifu-\ngation and re-suspended in 1 ml LB containing 0.5% L-\narabinose which was added to induce expression of the \u03bb-\nRed and I-SceI genes from pACBSCE. Note that antibiotics\nwere omitted from the growth medium at this stage. The\nculture was incubated at 37\u00b0C, with vigorous shaking\nuntil turbid (approximately 4-5 hours). Dilutions of the\nculture were then plated on to LB agar plates containing\n50 \u03bcg\/ml kanamycin and 5% sucrose and incubated over-\nnight at 30\u00b0C. Kanamycin resistant, sucrose insensitive\nrecombinants were checked for donor plasmid loss by\npatching onto LB agar plates containing 200 \u03bcg\/ml ampi-\ncillin and pACBSCE plasmid loss by patching onto LB agar\nplates containing 35 \u03bcg\/ml chloramphenicol. Recombi-\nnation was confirmed by PCR and sequencing, using oli-\ngonucleotide primers homologous to chromosomal DNA\nflanking the modified region (sequencing provided by the\nBirmingham Functional Genomics laboratory). Note: in\naddition, dilutions of the culture were routinely plated\nonto LB agar plates and LB agar plates supplemented withPage 12 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Microbiology 2009, 9:252 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2180\/9\/252200 \u03bcg\/ml of ampicillin, to quantify the amount of donor\nplasmid digestion by I-SceI and LB agar plates and LB agar\nplates supplemented with 35 \u03bcg\/ml chloramphenicol, to\nquantify pACBSCE digestion by I-SceI.\nConstruction of pDOC derivatives for generating lacI gene \nfusions\nFour different lacI gene fusions were constructed in\nMG1655, producing the following recombinant proteins;\nLacI::6 \u00d7 His, LacI::3 \u00d7 FLAG, LacI::4 \u00d7 ProteinA and\nLacI::GFP. For the LacI::6 \u00d7 His construct, two primers\nwere designed to amplify the 6 \u00d7 his coding region and the\nkanamycin cassette from pDOC-H: the first primer,\nD60113, included 27 bp of homology to the C-terminus\nof lacI, excluding the stop codon, and 18 bp homology to\npDOC-H and was designed so that the 6 \u00d7 his sequence\nwas in frame with the lacI coding sequence. The second\nprimer, D60114 included 27 bp of homology to the\nregion immediately downstream of lacI, and homology to\nthe P-REV annealing sequence. These primers were used to\namplify the kanamycin resistance cassette, using pDOC-H\nas a template, and a proof-reading thermostable DNA\npolymerase that produces a blunt-ended amplicon. The\nresulting fragment was blunt end ligated into the EcoRV\nsite of pDOC-C. The cloned region was sequenced using\nprimers D58793 and D58794, which anneal to the S1 and\nS2 sites (Figure 2) in the pDOC-C plasmid. The resulting\nplasmid was then used to tag the chromosomal lacI gene\nin E. coli strain MG1655 by gene doctoring. Recombinants\nwere checked by PCR and sequencing using primers\nD61347, which anneals within the lacI gene, and D57785,\nwhich anneals to the CC1 sequence shown in Figure 2.\nThe lacI::3 \u00d7 FLAG, lacI::4 \u00d7 ProteinA and lacI::GFP gene\nfusions were made using longer regions of homology to\nthe chromosome, cloned directly into the pDOC-F,\npDOC-P and pDOC-G cloning regions. The C-terminal\n200 bp of the lacI gene, excluding the stop codon, was\namplified by PCR using primers D59400 and D59401,\nand cloned into CR1 of the appropriate tagging vector, on\na EcoRI:KpnI fragment, arranged so that the coding\nsequence of the gene was in frame with the epitope tag.\nNext, a 200 bp region of the lacZ gene (codons 130-205)\nwas amplified by PCR using primers D59402 and D59403\nand cloned into CR2 of the appropriate tagging vector, on\na XhoI:NheI fragment. The resulting plasmids were then\nused to tag the chromosomal lacI gene in E. coli strain\nMG1655 by gene doctoring. Recombinants were checked\nby PCR and DNA sequencing as before.\nWestern blotting\nCells of strain MG1655lacI::3 \u00d7 FLAG, MG1655lacI::4 \u00d7\nProteinA and MG1655lacI::gfp were grown in LB medium\nat 37\u00b0C to an OD650 of 1.2. Samples were taken and cell\nextracts were separated on a SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were\nthen transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was\nprobed with antibodies specific for the FLAG peptide\n(Sigma), ProteinA (Sigma) or GFP (Roche). The mem-\nbranes were then incubated with HRP-labeled anti-mouse\nIgG (Sigma), and binding of antibody visualized by scan-\nning with a Syngene Gene Genius Bioimaging System.\nAffinity isolation of LacI::6 \u00d7 His\nA 100 ml culture of strain MG1655lacI::6 \u00d7 his was grown\nin LB medium at 37\u00b0C to an OD650 of 1.2. Cells were har-\nvested and re-suspended in 4 mls of lysis buffer (10 mM\nTris, 100 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol). Lysozyme was added\nto a final concentration of 400 \u03bcg\/ml, and the mixture\nincubated on ice for 30 minutes, with regular mixing.\nAfter lysozyme treatment, the lysate was cleared by centrif-\nugation and the supernatant incubated with 200 \u03bcl of\nNTA-Ni-agarose beads (Qiagen), on ice for 30 minutes.\nThe supernatant was then removed, and the beads washed\nwith 1 ml of wash buffer (10 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl,\n10% Glycerol, 10 mM Imidazole). LacI::6 \u00d7 His was then\neluted from the beads with 100 \u03bcl of elution buffer (10\nmM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 250 mM Imida-\nzole).\nAuthors' contributions\nDJL constructed the pDOC plasmids, designed the proto-\ncol, performed the experiments and co-wrote the manu-\nscript.
