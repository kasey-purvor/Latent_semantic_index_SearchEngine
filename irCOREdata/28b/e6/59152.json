Introduction \n \nCoastal areas support many human activities and represent a very important habitat for many marine and \nbird species. In order to properly manage such areas, knowledge of the physical, biological and chemical \nprocesses is necessary and therefore the observation, quantification and simulation of such processes are a \npre-requisite. Coastal waves and currents are highly variable and can have a significant impact on coastal \nerosion and sediment transport in coastal areas. This sediment transport (erosion, suspension and \ndeposition) is largely controlled by the bed shear stress produced by the hydrodynamic conditions. \nDepending on the environment the hydrodynamics can be current-dominated, wave-dominated or a \ncombination of both (Soulsby, 1997).  \nIn this paper, analysis of field data is performed in order to asses the hydrodynamics and its links to \nsediment in suspension. First, the study area is presented. In section 2 the data and methods used are \ndescribed. Results are shown in section 3 and finally some discussion and conclusions are drawn. \n \n1.1 Study area \n \nThe Dee estuary (Fig. 1), located in the eastern Irish Sea, is 20 km long, 8 km wide at the mouth and is \ncharacterized by a 10 m tidal range. The Dee has undergone substantial levels of sedimentation over the \npast two centuries, resulting in land reclamation and salt marsh colonization. Moore et al (2008) showed \nthe tidal asymmetry of the Dee and its relation to the overall sedimentation of the estuary. The Dee estuary \npresents a mixture of sediments containing a range of non-cohesive and cohesive sediments and, therefore, \nthe threshold of motion of the bed might be a complex process dependent on several conditions. In recent \nyears, the estuary has been the subject of an annual ship borne and mooring survey program, with a \ncomprehensive suite of instruments deployed to measure and interpret the hydrodynamics, turbulence and \nsediment transport in the area. In the present paper we present a summary of the most recent data, collected \nFebruary to March 2008, which encompassed the spring-neap tidal cycle and included several short storms.  \n                                                           \n1Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, Joseph Proudman Building, 6 Brownlow Street Liverpool L3 5DA, UK. \nrbol@pol.ac.uk \n  \n \n2. Data and Methods \n \nThe data presented were collected during 2 STABLE (Sediment Transport and Boundary Layer Equipment) \nbenthic tripod platform deployments, in the Hilbre and Welsh channels at the mouth of the Dee (Fig. 1). A \nlarge tripod, STABLE-3.0, was deployed in the Hilbre channel, whilst a smaller version, mini-STABLE, \nwas deployed in the Welsh channel. Both included a suite of optical and acoustic instruments and Table 1 \nsummarizes the instrumentation present on each rig. The data cover a wide range of environmental \nconditions, being ideal to build an overall picture of the physical processes controlling the estuary. The aim \nof the deployments was to determine the link between the hydrodynamics, turbulence, bedforms and \nsuspended sediments, and therefore the attention here is placed on data from the Acoustic Doppler \nVelocimeters (ADV), Acoustic Backscatter System (ABS), Laser In-Situ Scattering and Transmissometry \n(LISST), and Optical Backscatter Sensor (OBS). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.

ADV data \n \nThe ADVs provided collocated measurements of the 3 components of flow at high temporal resolution at a \nsingle point. Detailed quality control including despiking of ADVs data was carried out. The removal of \nspikes is necessary as they are known to erroneously modify the spectral analysis and estimation of bottom \nstress. The approach taken was following Goring and Nikora (2002) and modified by Wahl (2003). The \nmethod is based on a 3D Poincar\u00e9 map in which each component of velocity and its first and second \nderivative are plotted against each other. The points located outside of the ellipsoid in the Poincar\u00e9 map are \nexcluded or replaced by a polynomial interpolation. This method has been used by Mori et al (2007) to \nclean ADV data in bubbly flows.  \nThe despiking method was applied to all the raw ADV data. ADVs were operated in burst mode, on the \nhour for a duration of 20 minutes, with sampling frequencies of 8 and 16 Hz for the ADVs on STABLE-3.0 \nand mini-STABLE respectively. The ADVs were deployed on STABLE-3.0 at height of 0.4 m, 0.7 m and 1 \nm and on mini-STABLE at height of 0.35 m and 0.63 m above the bed. \nThe despiking method removed the anomalous peaks in the time series and conserved the underlying \noriginal properties. The spikes can appear in a record due to contamination of pulses, bubbles or large \nparticular matter in the water column. Figure 2 shows an example of a time series before and after \napplication of the despiking method.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Example of a raw and despiked time series from ADV \n \n \n2.2. Wave data \n \nFor the estimation of wave parameters, the PUV (pressure and velocity) method was applied to the ADV \nand pressure data. This method uses linear wave theory to convert velocity and pressure spectra to surface \nelevation spectra (Gordon and Lohrmann, 2001): \n \n2\n2\n22\n2\n)(cosh\n)sinh(\n)(cosh\n)cosh(\n\u03c3\n\u03c1\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\nu\nu\np\np\nC\nzhk\nkhC\ng\nC\nzhk\nkhC\n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n+=\n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n+=                                                               (1) \n \n \nwhere \nupCC \u03b7\u03b7  are surface elevation spectra based on pressure and velocity, k is wave number, h is the \nmean water depth relative to the seabed, and z is the vertical distance relative to the mean water level.

Another limitation is \nthat at any given frequency the PUV will estimate a single direction. \nADCP wave data was used at STABLE-3.0 as there was no pressure sensor data available for the PUV. A \ncomparison of the two ADCP wave data showed a very close agreement. \n \n2.3. Sediment in suspension \n \nSuspended load can significantly contribute to the total sediment transport, and when it occurs has been \nobserved to exceed the bedload transport (Soulsby, 1997). In an environment such as the Dee, subject to \nlarge tidal currents, episodic wave events, and mixed sediments, sediment in suspension is an important \nvariable that can determine the total transport of particles. In the present study, variables relating to \nsediment in suspension were measured with ABS, LISST and OBS. The LISST and OBS data were treated \nwith the instrument calibration information. ABS data was inverted to obtain sediment concentration \nprofiles. A description of these instruments and the data interpretation is presented below. \n \n2.3.1 ABS \nAcoustic backscatter techniques to measure suspended sediments have gained in popularity over the last 2 \ndecades (Young et al., 1982, Vincent et al, 1991; Crawford and Hay, 1993; Thorne and Hardcastle, 1997). \nIn the present study, multi-frequency ABS instruments operating at 1, 2 and 4 MHz were deployed on both \nSTABLE rigs, though the ABS on mini-STABLE failed to record. The instruments were designed in-house \nand measure the envelope of the backscattered signal at intervals of 0.01 m over a range of 1.28 m. A pulse \nrepetition frequency of 128 Hz was used with a system generated ensemble average produced every 32 \npings, generating one recorded profile every 0.25 seconds. The instruments were calibrated following the \nprocedure described by Betteridge et al (2008). Using the intrinsic scattering properties of irregularly \nshaped quartz sediments available in the literature (Thorne and Meral, 2008), iterative, semi-analytical \ninversions of the ABS data were conducted utilizing the LISST data to account for the size distribution, \nwhich is known to significantly alter the ensemble scattering properties of marine suspensions (Thorne and \nMeral, 2008; Thorne et al, 2007).   \n \n2.3.2 LISST \nLISST instruments provide estimates of particle size, operating on the principle of laser diffraction. There \nare 2 standard LISST models, each designed to measure different size ranges. In the present study type-C \nLISSTs were deployed, measuring particles in the 2.5 to 500 \u00b5m diameter range across 32 log spaced bins. \nApplication of the manufacturers calibrations results in a volume distribution in units of microliters per liter, \nwhich is the measurement unit that will be utilized here. The LISST does not require routine calibration, \nthough the laser optics must be checked on a regular basis to ensure that they remain properly aligned \n  \n(Styles, 2006). Apart from the use of the calibration and background scatter of the instrument, the data did \nnot require further cleaning. The LISST were deployed on STABLE-3.0 lat a height of 1.8 m  and on mini-\nSTABLE at a height of 1.56 m. \n \n2.3.3 OBS \nTurbidity sensors measure the amount of light transmission of water to give a measurement of the \nsuspended solids in that water. They were deployed on STABLE and connected to the ADVs. \nUnfortunately only one OBS recorded successfully at the height of 1 m. \n \n2.4.  Bottom stress \n \n2.4.1 Inertial Dissipation method \n \nThe inertial dissipation method is used to estimate the friction velocity, where the friction velocity is \ndefined as (Green, 1992): \n \n2\/13\/5\n1\n13\/1\n* ])([)( kkEkzU i\n\u2212= \u03b1                                                        (4) \n \nwhere E(k) is the energy spectrum. The constant \u03b1 takes the value of 0.51 for spectra in the direction of the \nmean flow and 0.69 for the spectra of a transverse component of the main flow. The spectrum is defined \nsuch that the sum over all positive frequencies yields the variance of the velocity component. \nTo estimate the wave number spectra from the frequency spectra the \u201cfrozen-turbulence hypothesis\u201d has \nbeen applied yielding: \n \n                                          Ufk \/2\u03c0=           )2\/)(()( \u03c0UfEkE =                                            (5) \n \nOnce having the wave number spectra it was necessary to identify the valid wave numbers for the inertial \nsub-range. Following Green (1992) the lower wave number was defined as the largest of z\/2\u03c0  and the \nlowest measured wave number. The highest wave number limit was defined as the smallest of the highest \nmeasured wave number, dL\/2\u03c0 , and sL\/2\u03c0 . Typically Ld = 0.1 cm in the sea (Soulsby, 1983). sL\/2\u03c0  \nrepresents a kind of half-power point that reflects spatial averaging by the sensor, in this case (for the \nADV) Ls =0.01 was used, being ~ the sample volume of the instrumentation.  \n \nIn order to provide a higher order of confidence with the method, evaluation of stresses were performed \nconsidering different parts of the tail of the spectra when fitting the linear tail. The wavenumber \ncorresponding to 1 Hz was identified (above this wave effects are negligible) and a linear fit was applied to \n3 parts of the spectra: i) full range defined by the inertial dissipation method, ii) from the wavenumber \ncorresponding to 1Hz to the upper limit estimated by the inertial dissipation method and iii) from the \nlowest limit from the inertial dissipation method to the value of 1Hz. This procedure was applied to both, \nvertical and horizontal velocity component. Figure 3 shows an example of spectra from the horizontal and \nvertical velocity component. Some wave effects are evident at the horizontal wave spectra. From the \ndifferent tail fittings it was found that using the vertical component and the last part of the tail produced the \nslope closest to the theoretical one and therefore was the one used for the estimation of stress. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                                   \n \nFigure 3. Spectra of horizontal and vertical components of the velocity. Lines in the tail of the spectra shows the linear \nfit, black line on the top left represents the -5\/3 slope. \n \n2.4.2 Reynolds stress method \nNear the bed a constant stress layer is formed in which a logarithmic velocity profile is formed and the \nReynolds stress equals the bottom stress (Howard and Souza, 2005). An estimate of the bottom stress is \nobtained from mean Reynolds stresses: \n2\/1\n2___2___\n)( vwuw += \u03c1\u03c4                                               (6) \nIt is assumed that the presence of waves has little effect as it is assumed that u and v are 180o out of phase \nwith w. However this neglects turbulence generated at the bed by combined waves and currents. \n \n \n \n \n3. Results \n \n3.1. Hydrodynamics  \n \nFigure 4 shows time series of hydrodynamic parameters at Hilbre channel during the deployment period. \nCurrent speed is controlled by tides and it follows the spring\/neap and flood \/ebb cycle. Velocities at this \nlocation are slightly larger during flood. Wave parameters are modulated by tide and the wave event during \nthe second neap period, observed in the Welsh channel, is not present in the Hilbre channel due to a \npossible dissipation of energy when waves propagate in the estuary mouth. Current direction at the Hilbre \nchannel location is aligned with N-S and E-W at the Welsh channel. The ebbs at the Welsh channel produce \na change in current direction that could be attributed to eddy formation due to curvature of channel, \ninteraction with the fame and with the coastline ledge. Wave direction is predominantly from E and NE at \nthe Welsh channel, however at the Hilbre predominant directions are from north, in agreement with the \nchannel orientation.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

Bottom stress from Reynolds stress present similar behavior (and magnitude) as the \ninertial dissipation. The use of turbulence only time series significantly reduces the estimates. \n \nFigure 5 shows a time series of bottom stress at the Hilbre channel during the transition from neap to spring \ntides. The bottom stress from the inertial dissipation presents similarities at flood and ebb with values of \nthe order of 1 N\/m2. The use of the vertical velocity spectra produces a slight reduction of the estimates. \nThe use of the Reynolds stresses produces an asymmetry between flood and ebb with the ebb stresses being \nlarger.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5. Time series of bottom stress at Hilbre channel during the transition from neap to spring tides with both \nmethods. \n \n  \n \n3.3 Sediment in suspension \n \nHere, the LISST is used to provide an indication of the sediment size distribution in the area. Figure 6 \nshows a distribution of sediment during the first days of deployment at STABLE-3.0 and mini-STABLE \nand in a time when the smallest particles dominates (to reduce possible shifting of the distribution due to \nflocculation). Its shows a dominance of small particles with a diameter around 70 microns which represent \nthe limit between silt and very fine sand, there is also an important contribution of fine sand. Both locations \nshow the same pattern in size distribution, but larger concentrations at the Welsh channel. The large \nconcentration of cohesive particles could support the formation of flocs at some stage of the tidal cycle. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6. Size distribution of suspended sediment during the first day of deployment. \n \n \nFigure 7 shows time series of integrated parameters from the LISST and the OBS at STABLE-3.0 in the \nHilbre channel. The behaviors of the mean concentration and the cumulative concentration is very similar. \nThe suspended sediment concentration from the LISST is not clearly related to flood and ebb but there is \nan evident signal that correlates with the spring-neap cycle. The standard deviation of the size is linearly \nrelated to the concentration, the larger the concentration the larger the size distribution. The peak size of the \ndistribution shows an interesting pattern, the time series shows that, in contrary to concentration, large \nparticles are present for both spring and neap tides and this might be controlled by flood and ebb cycle. The \nturbidity data from the OBS shows a very similar pattern as the concentration from the LISST showing a \nlarge correlation, a strong neap\/spring signal. The mild wave events have a slight effect on sediment \nconcentration from the LISST. It can be observed a rise of concentration and turbidity in the burst 380 that \nagrees with a wave event. Interestingly the turbidity from the OBS is not significantly modified.  \nFigure 8 shows scatter plots of north component of velocity (component along the channel) and bottom \nstresses and concentration. It is clear the direct relationship between velocity and bottom stress outlining \nthe effect of the tidal cycle. However the concentration from the LISST presents large scatter when \ncompared with bottom stress. This shows that the concentration at 1.5 m above the bed is not a pure \nrepresentation of bottom processes but it could also involve some flocculation and small particle processes \nthat might need longer time to react to environmental conditions.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7.

Discussions and conclusions \n \n \nPrevious studies have shown that the Dee presents a mix of cohesive and non cohesive sediments. This \nimportant property can control the formation of ripples and the behavior of the re-suspension of sediment. \nIn this paper, we have shown that the Hilbre and Welsh channels present different bottom stress and \nturbulence behavior. One of the main differences between the 2 locations is the asymmetry of bottom stress \nfound during flood and ebb at the Welsh channel. These differences might be produced by a complex eddy \nformation during the ebb tide due to the curvature of the channel and interaction with bathymetry. This is \nalso observed by changes in horizontal velocity direction during ebbs, a process that also affects \nsignificantly the behavior of the vertical velocity. A second difference is that the Welsh channel location \nwas more exposed to the wave events during neap tides and therefore some bottom stress due to wave and \ncurrent interaction could be expected. \n \nThe fact that the LISST data does not correlate well with bottom stress is not surprising as the LISST was \nlocated at about 1.5 m above the bed and therefore the LISST data might explain only aggregation and \nbraking of particles and not the instantaneous local resuspension of sediment from the bed. ABS data \npresent a slight diferent patter than the LISST recording an important increase of sediment concentration \nnear the bed during the wave event. \n \n  \nSuspended sediment concentration is clearly controlled by tides following the flood\/ ebb and spring\/neap \ncycle. Moderate wave event can increase sediment concentration mainly near the bed. It was found a high \nconcentration of  silt and very fine sand that could support the flocculation processes following the flood \nand ebb cycle.  \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nAuthors thank the support of the FORMOST (Field observation and modelling of the sediment triad) \nNERC project. \n \n \nReferences \n \nWahl, T.
