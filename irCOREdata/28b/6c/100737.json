INTRODUCTION\nFor a number of years, there has been considerable in-\nterest in finding suitable emitters at the so-called \u201ctelecom-\nmunication wavelengths,\u201d defined by the dispersion and ab-\nsorption minima of silica fibers at 1.3 and 1.55 \u0001m, re-\nspectively. Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers1 \u0001VCSEL\u0002\nhave a circular beam profile and thus a superior beam qual-\nity, making them ideal for coupling into a fiber. Further ben-\nefits of VCSELs are low manufacturing costs and uncooled\nstable operation. High quality VCSELs can be realized using\nthe GaAs\/ \u0001AlGa\u0002As material system where the excellent\nmatching of the materials\u2019 lattice constants, the high refrac-\ntive index contrast, and the mature growth technology offer\nhigh quality Bragg mirrors.2 However, emitters at telecom-\nmunication wavelengths today are often InP-based\n\u0001InGa\u0002\u0001AsP\u0002 structures, which cannot be grown on GaAs due\nto the high lattice mismatch. Possible GaAs-based alterna-\ntives include the dilute nitrides,3 InAs\/GaAs quantum dots4\nand, as is discussed here, Ga\u0001AsSb\u0002 quantum wells where\nroom temperature VCSEL operation was already\ndemonstrated.5\nAn unresolved question remains the band alignment of\nGaAs1\u2212xSbx embedded between GaAs for 0.3\u0002x\u00020.4\nwhich is the relevant Sb content for emission at telecommu-\nnication wavelengths. While holes are almost certainly con-\nfined in the Ga\u0001AsSb\u0002 layer, electrons may or may not be,\nmaking the structure spatially direct \u0001type I\u0002 or spatially in-\ndirect \u0001type II\u0002, respectively. This has major implications for\nthe lasing performance due to the changing electron-hole\nwave function overlap which determines the strength of the\noptical dipole matrix element.\na\u0002Electronic mail: angela.thraenhardt@physik.uni-marburg.de\nb\u0002Present address: I.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nFor a realistic prediction of optical spectra, we employ a\nfully microscopic theory6 based on the semiconductor Bloch\nequations.7 For semiconductor laser gain calculations, we\nhave found a microscopic inclusion of carrier correlations\nindispensable.8 Calculations then reproduce experimental\nspectra without the need for phenomenological quantities\nlike scattering times which depend on experimental param-\neters such as structure, temperature, and excitation density.\nThe theory has been shown to yield good results in\nGa\u0001AsSb\u0002 \u0001Ref. 9\u0002 as well as other telecommunication wave-\nlength materials, i.e., the dilute nitrides.10,11\nIn this article, we present a combined experiment\u2014\ntheory approach. We investigate a set of\nGa\u0001AsSb\u0002 \/GaAs\/ \u0001AlGa\u0002As single quantum well \u0001QW\u0002\nsamples in order to characterize the conduction band align-\nment between Ga\u0001AsSb\u0002 and GaAs with an accuracy which\nhas not been achieved previously. This level of accuracy is\nreached by analyzing the line shape of the modulation spec-\ntra in the region of the confined interband transitions instead\nof solely analyzing transition energies. The former approach\nis realized by a direct comparison of measured spectra and\nthose calculated employing a fully microscopic theory. Ear-\nlier studies of this material system yielded controversial re-\nsults. The analysis of the photoluminescence \u0001PL\u0002 peaks as a\nfunction of spacer thickness indicated a weak type-I band\nalignment,12 whereas a second investigation studying the ex-\ncitation intensity dependent shift of the PL peak positions at\nlow temperature inferred the interface to be weakly type II.13\nThere are several other publications supporting either type I\n\u0001Refs. 14 and 15\u0002 or type II \u0001Refs. 16\u201318\u0002 alignment. Here,\nwe will show that a comparison of electroabsorption \u0001EA\u0002\nexperiments with a microscopic theory clearly shows a\ntype-II offset of 40\u00b120 meV in the conduction band.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe Ga\u0001AsSb\u0002 \/GaAs\/ \u0001AlGa\u0002As single QW samples in-\nvestigated here were grown by molecular beam epitaxy on\nn-doped GaAs wafers. The nominally undoped epitaxial lay-\ners consist of a 400 nm GaAs buffer, two 75 nm\nAl0.25Ga0.75As barrier layers which enclose the QW region\nand a 50 nm GaAs capping layer. The QW consists of\n7 nm GaAs1\u2212xSbx with adjacent GaAs spacers. The spacer\nthickness was varied between 0 and 6 nm yielding a set of\nfive samples.19 The average Sb content in the quantum well\nis x=0.357 but growth related slight differences result in Sb\ncontents as follows: no spacer 0.360\u00b10.001, 1 nm spacer\n0.356\u00b10.002, 2 nm spacer 0.355\u00b10.003, 3 nm spacer\n0.358\u00b10.001, and 6 nm spacer 0.361\u00b10.003.12\nFor the EA and electroreflectance \u0001ER\u0002 measurements\nthe samples were coated with a thin layer of 5 nm of Pt,\nserving as a top contact, while the n-doped GaAs substrate\nwas grounded. Thus a direct current \u0001dc\u0002 bias voltage could\nbe used to alter the internal field and an additional square\nwave alternating current voltage of typically 1.0 V was ap-\nplied for modulation. The probe light, provided by a 100 W\ntungsten-halide lamp, was dispersed using a 1 m monochro-\nmator \u0001B&M\u0002 with a band pass better than 1 meV and was\nfocused onto the sample, which was mounted on the cold\nfinger of a He flow cryostat. The reflected \u0001transmitted\u0002 light\nR\u0001I\u0002 and its modulation \u0003R\u0001\u0003I\u0002 were detected with a\nnitrogen-cooled Ge detector \u0001North-Coast\u0002 and measured us-\ning a multimeter \u0001Keithley 195A\u0002 and a lock-in amplifier\n\u0001Stanford 830DSP\u0002, respectively.\nIn case of negligible changes of the reflectivity and the\nrefractive index, the relative change of the transmitted inten-\nsity \u0003I \/ I yields directly the field-induced change \u0003\u0004 of the\nabsorption constant\n\u0003\u0004 = \u2212\n\u0003I\nId\n, \u00011\u0002\nwhere d is the thickness of the layer that generates the signal.\nThis requirement is fulfilled for EA spectra in the vicinity of\nthe lowest interband transitions of the\n\u0001AlGa\u0002As\/GaAs\/Ga\u0001AsSb\u0002 \/GaAs\/ \u0001AlGa\u0002As structure, i.e.,\nthe QW states. However, EA spectra cannot be acquired in\nthe barrier region because of the strongly absorbing GaAs\nsubstrate. Therefore, ER spectroscopic measurements have\nbeen employed to measure signals from the GaAs capping\nand \u0001AlGa\u0002As barrier region and thus to obtain additional\ninformation about the structure. Further details on the setups\ncan be found in Ref. 21.\nIII. MICROSCOPIC THEORY\nFor a realistic calculation of EA spectra, we need to\ncompute the two corresponding absorption spectra at the in-\nternal electric fields determined by the sum and the differ-\nence, respectively, of external bias voltage and modulation\nvoltage amplitude. In order to mimic the EA experiment, the\ntwo calculated absorption spectra are subtracted from each\nother.23 The absorption is calculated from the imaginary part\nof the polarization6 P,\n\u0004\u0001\u0005\u0002 =\n\u0005\nnBc\nIm\u0005 P\u0001\u0005\u0002VE\u0001\u0005\u0002\u0006 , \u00012\u0002\nwhere c is the vacuum speed of light, nB is the background\nindex of refraction, V is the quantization volume and E\u0001\u0005\u0002 is\nthe electric field of the incident light. The macroscopic po-\nlarization may be calculated from the microscopic interband\npolarizations Pk\u0006\u0006\u0001= \u0007h\u2212k, \u0006\u0001ek, \u0006\b where e and h are electron\nand hole annihilation operators, respectively, \u0006 and \u0006\u0001 are the\nelectron and hole subband levels and k is the in-plane mo-\nmentum. The microscopic polarizations are computed from\nthe semiconductor Bloch equations, see Ref. 24 for the\nmultiband case. Coulomb interaction is fully taken into ac-\ncount which is important especially in a type-II structure\nwhere unconfined carriers may still be bound by electron-\nhole attraction.\nThe band structure is determined from an 8\u00078-k \u00b7p\ntheory.25,26 Figure 1 shows the electron \u0001top\u0002 and hole \u0001bot-\ntom\u0002 bandstructure of the 6 nm spacer structure at a tempera-\nture of T=30 K. We plot the five electron and four hole\nbands which are taken into account. The reason for the small\nspacing between the electron subbands lies in the very small\noffset in the conduction band at the GaAs\/GaAsSb interface\nand will be explained in detail in Sec. V.\n033118-2 B\u00fcckers et al. J. Appl. Phys. 101, 033118 \u00022007\u0001\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nElectron-electron and electron-phonon scattering are\ntreated in second Born and Markov approximation.27 Sample\nparameters were taken from Refs. 28 and 29 with the excep-\ntion of the bowing parameter where a value of 1.58 eV was\nused.12\nIV. ANALYSIS OF THE BUILT-IN ELECTRIC FIELD\nThe employed square wave modulation voltage of 1.0 V\ncorresponds nominally to an electric field of 15 kV\/cm as-\nsuming that the entire voltage drop occurs in the intrinsic\nregion \u0001about 600 nm\u0002. However, this is usually not the case\nin multilayered structures where interface and surface\ncharges are present, which lead to a partial screening of the\nexternal bias voltage. Here, we will present evidence that the\nbuilt-in electric field at a constant external bias voltage varies\nfor the different layers in the structures under study and will\ngive some estimates of the internal field modulation caused\nby an external voltage modulation which will then be com-\npared with values obtained from the theoretical analysis of\nthe EA spectra discussed in Sec. V. Information about the\ninternal electric fields can be obtained from an analysis of\nFranz\u2013Keldysh oscillations \u0001FKOs\u0002 as a function of bias\nvoltage in bulk-like layers such as the GaAs capping layer of\n50 nm \u0001Ref. 20\u0002 and from an analysis of the \u201cquantum con-\nfined Stark effect\u201d \u0001QCSE\u0002, i.e., the response of the lowest\nquantum well transition to the internal electric field changes\ncaused by externally applied bias voltages.\nThe internal electric field F in a bulk-like layer can be\ndeduced from corresponding FKOs using the following rela-\ntion:\n\u0001En \u2212 Eg\u00023\/2 =\n3\n8\nFqh\n\t2m*\nn + \b , \u00013\u0002\nwhere Eg and m* are the band gap and the reduced mass of\nGaAs, respectively \u0001m*=0.05me where me is the free electron\nmass\u0002. En denotes the energy of the nth extremum of the\nFKOs, h is Planck\u2019s constant, q is the charge of the electron,\nand \b is an arbitrary phase offset.\nFigure 2 depicts ER spectra of the sample with 1 nm\nspacer obtained at room temperature in the vicinity of the\nGaAs and Al0.25Ga0.75As band gaps for different external\nbias voltages. The FKOs in the GaAs ranging from 1.42 eV\nup to the \u0001AlGa\u0002As band gap near 1.75 eV are well pro-\nnounced. The change of the oscillation period with changing\nexternal bias voltage is clearly discernible. In contrast, the\nFKOs in the Al0.25Ga0.75As region above 1.75 eV are con-\nfused by underlying signals arising from the spin-orbit split-\noff band of GaAs \u0001\n1.76 eV\u0002 and thus not suitable for an\nanalysis according to Eq. \u00013\u0002. The flatband situation in the\nGaAs capping layer is characterized by the disappearance of\nthe FKOs which takes place at a bias voltages of about\n\u22120.5\u00b10.5 V. The bias voltage where the flatband situation\noccurs varies slightly from sample to sample by \u00b11 V.\nThe results of the analysis of the FKOs in the GaAs\nregion using Eq. \u00013\u0002 are presented in Fig. 3. The main graph\nshows plots of \u0001En\u2212Eg\u00023\/2 versus the index n of the FKO\nextrema for three different bias voltages. The deviation from\nthe ideal linear behavior starting at indices n\t6 is a typical\nindication of an inhomogeneous field distribution in the\nstructure. Nevertheless, restricting the analysis to the low\nindex region alone allows one to extract a lower boundary\nfor the internal field in this layer which is often used as a\nreasonable estimate of the field in the vicinity of the QW\nregion. The inset shows the dependence of the extracted es-\ntimate of the built-in electric field versus bias voltage. A\nlinear dependence is obtained for positive \u0001forward\u0002 as well\nas negative \u0001reverse\u0002 bias. The differences in the slope arise\ndue to the asymmetry of the sample \u0001i.e., n-doped GaAs\nsubstrate\/intrinsic structure\/Schottky Pt contact region\u0002.\nFigure 4 shows EA absorption spectra of the same\nsample in the vicinity of the lowest QW transition in the\nGa\u0001AsSb\u0002 \/GaAs\/ \u0001AlGa\u0002As region for various external bias\nvoltages. Assuming a situation at a constant bias voltage\nFIG. 1. Electron \u0001top\u0002 and hole \u0001bottom\u0002 bandstructure of the 6 nm spacer\nsample at T=30 K.

Phys. 101, 033118 \u00022007\u0001\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nwhere the internal electric field in the QW region is zero, a\nchange of the bias voltage will lead to a redshift of the low-\nest QW transition independent of the sign of the voltage\nchange. This is a consequence of the QCSE.22 Therefore, the\nflatband situation in the QW region can be deduced from a\nplot of the lowest QW transition energy EQW versus applied\nbias as shown in the inset of the figure. The application of a\nbias voltage of \u22125.8 V corresponding to the maximum of\nEQW leads to the flatband situation in the QW region. It is\nworth noting that the flatband situation in the GaAs capping\nlayer and in the QW region occur at very different applied\nbiases which manifests the large field inhomogeneities in the\nsamples. However, the bias voltage where the flatband situ-\nation in the QW region occurs varies throughout the series of\nsamples, i.e., +1 V, \u00b10 V, +1 V, and \u22121 V for spacers of 0,\n2, 3, and 6 nm, respectively. The EA spectra for each sample\nin the vicinity of the flatband situation in the QW layers will\nbe used in the analysis of the conduction band offsets in the\nfollowing section.\nV. DETERMINATION OF THE Ga\u201eAsSb\u2026 \/GaAs\nCONDUCTION BAND OFFSET\nFor the investigation of the optical properties of our\nGa\u0001AsSb\u0002 QW samples, we choose the method of electroab-\nsorption which sensitively measures absorption changes in-\nduced by an electric field. In the experiments, the field\nswitches between two different values and absorption\nchanges are measured; imitating this in the calculation leads\nus to compute the absorption for two different electric fields\nand subtract the spectra from each other. Figure 5 shows the\nlinear absorption calculated for the electric fields of 0 kV\/cm\n\u0001dashed\u0002 and 15 kV\/cm \u0001dotted\u0002 in the 6 nm spacer structure.\nThe electric field applied in growth direction causes a red-\nshift \u0001linear field effect\u0002 as well as a loss of oscillator\nstrength of the strong diagonal transitions e1_h1, e2_h2,\nwhile at the same time the formerly forbidden transitions like\ne1_h2 gain oscillator strength \u0001quadratic field effect\u0002. Both\neffects are a manifestation of the QCSE introduced in Sec.\nIV. The solid line at the bottom of Fig. 5 shows the calcu-\nlated EA signal where the two spectra were subtracted from\neach other. For the interpretation of the modulated spectra\none generally has to bear in mind that a gain \u0001loss\u0002 of oscil-\nlator strength leads to a peak \u0001dip\u0002 while a shift results in a\ndispersive line shape. For instance, the redshift of the lowest\ntransition causes a dispersive type signal which is rendered\nasymmetric by the loss of oscillator strength of the lowest\ntransition. Formerly forbidden transitions like the e2_h1 or\ne1_h2 gain oscillator strength when an electric field is ap-\nplied which is manifested in positive signals. The figure also\nshows that gain and loss of oscillator strength of the various\ninterband transitions are correlated and that this correlation is\nclearly reflected in the EA spectra.

A\nspecial feature of the 6 nm spacer sample considered here is\nthe large oscillator strength of the e3_h1 transition even\nwithout an applied electric field. It arises due to the almost\nflat conduction band offset between GaAs and Ga\u0001AsSb\u0002 at\nthis alloy composition, i.e., the electron barriers are not\nformed by the GaAs, but by the \u0001AlGa\u0002As. Holes, on the\nother hand, are already well confined within GaAs0.65Sb0.35,\ni.e., GaAs acts as a hole barrier. The confinement potential\nand e3 and h1 wave functions of the structure with 6 nm\nGaAs spacers at T=30 K are shown in Fig. 6 assuming a\nweak type-II offset of 40 meV. The effective well width for\nthe electrons includes the spacers and is about three times\nlarger than the effective well width for the holes\n\u00017 nm QW+2\u00b76 nm spacer\u0002, leading to an almost perfect\noverlap of first hole and third electron wave functions result-\ning in a strong e3_h1 transition. Figure 7 shows the squared\noscillator strength for all transitions for the field-free case\n\u0001flatband in each layer of the QW region\u0002. The large effective\nwell width for electrons also causes a high number of elec-\ntron states to be important in the calculation, see Figs. 1 and\n7. For instance, four electronic and three hole subband states\nare required to compute a correct absorption spectrum up to\nenergies of about 1.2 eV without an electric field. Applying a\nfield increases the number of states due to the QCSE-induced\nredshift. In the field-free case of Fig. 7, parity-forbidden tran-\nsitions have an oscillator strength of strictly zero. The e1_h1\ntransition shows a high oscillator strength; however, e2_h2\nand e3_h1 add up to make an even stronger absorption at\nhigher energies.\nWe will now address the determination of the correct\nconduction band offset by comparing measured EA spectra\nand those calculated using our microscopic approach. How-\never, some remarks need to be made beforehand. It should be\nnoted that, for this particular band structure situation, where\nalmost the entire gap difference between GaAs and\nGa\u0001AsSb\u0002 is to be found in the valence band and the conduc-\ntion band alignment is close to a negligible offset situation,\nthe distinction between a type-I and a type-II alignment\n\u0001talking about offsets in the conduction band of only about\n\u00b15% of the gap difference!\u0002 is extremely challenging. Con-\nventional approaches in modulation spectroscopy, where the\nmodulated spectra are fitted with line shape models to extract\nthe transition energies which are then compared to calculated\nvalues, will fail for several reasons: \u0001i\u0002 The material param-\neters for the GaAs1\u2212x-Sbx, including the variation of the band\ngap with composition x or the strain parameters such as the\nelastic compliances and the deformation potentials, are not\nknown to an extent of accuracy to enable a discussion of\nchanges of the transition energies due to confinement of\n\u00b140 meV on an absolute energy scale of about 1 eV set by\nthe band gap. \u0001ii\u0002 The transition energies will only weakly\ndepend on the offset variation discussed earlier and, more-\nover, these differences are within the uncertainties of the\ncalculation caused by the uncertainties in the material param-\neters. \u0001iii\u0002 Because of the large effective well width in the\nconduction band and the enhancement in oscillator strength\nof the nondiagonal transitions due to the different effective\nwell widths for electrons and holes, the transitions contribut-\ning significantly to the EA spectrum are very densely spaced\nin energy compared to their broadening. In a situation where\nbroad oscillators overlap, conventional fitting methods for\nextracting energy position, linewidth, and oscillator strength\nusually fail. For these three reasons, another approach for\ndetermining the offset situation is required which preferably\nshould not depend on absolute transition energies, but in-\nstead depends on the relative conduction band offset situa-\ntion only. A quantity which fulfills this requirement is the\nFIG. 6. Electron and hole confinement potentials for the sample with 6 nm\nGaAs spacers at T=30 K. A type-II offset of 40 meV is assumed. The\ndashed line shows the light hole confinement. Also shown are the first heavy\nhole and third electron wave functions. Since the effective quantum well\nwidth for the electron is about three times that for the holes, these wave\nfunctions have good overlap and a high oscillator strength, see Fig. 7.\nFIG. 7. Square of the dipole matrix element versus the transition energy for\nthe sample with 6 nm GaAs spacers at T=30 K. Both dipole matrix element\nand transition energy are taken at zero in-plane electron momentum, i.e., at\nthe band minimum. A type-II offset of 40 meV is assumed.\n033118-5 B\u00fcckers et al. J.

Again to\nemphasize this point, the differences between calculated and\nmeasured spectra on an absolute energy scale cannot serve as\na criterion in the offset determination as these are within the\nstandard deviation of the literature values for the band gap of\nGa\u0001AsSb\u0002.\nFigure 8 shows a comparison of calculated EA spectra\nwith a measurement taken in the vicinity of the flatband situ-\nation for the QW layers. Since the experiment gives the rela-\ntive change of transmitted intensity \u0003I \/ I, the calculated \u0003\u0004\nspectra were multiplied by the width of the active region;\nthus signal magnitudes in theory and experiment are compa-\nrable. The best quantitative agreement in terms of signal\nstrength was achieved for an internal electric field modula-\ntion of 4 kV\/cm. This value is of the same order of magni-\ntude as the values determined from the analysis of the FKOs\nin the GaAs capping layers \u0001see Sec. IV\u0002. Different conduc-\ntion band offsets of +60 meV \u0001type II\u0002, +40 meV \u0001type II\u0002,\n+20 meV \u0001type II\u0002, and \u221220 meV \u0001type I\u0002 were assumed in\nthe calculation. An inhomogeneous broadening of 12 meV is\nincluded. Obviously, the assumption of a weak type-II offset\nof about +40 meV gives the best agreement: The line shape\nof the first and second resonance \u0001around 1.04 and 1.12 eV,\nrespectively\u0002 are both quite well reproduced and the energeti-\ncal distance between these signals of about 0.073 eV matches\nthe experiment, too, thus giving a clear indication of a\ntype-II offset. The calculation assuming an offset of 20 meV\nshows a shoulder in the first resonance which is not visible in\nexperiment. Using higher offsets of about 60 meV yields two\ndips in the second resonance which do not occur in experi-\nment. We conclude that the offset is 40\u00b120 meV at a tem-\nperature of 30 K and in the following, assume an offset of\n+40 meV.\nTo verify the significance of the derived conduction band\noffset value and the predictive power of the microscopic\ntheory, we also calculated EA spectra of the same sample for\ndifferent bias voltages \u0001Fig. 9\u0002 and of samples with different\nGaAs spacer thickness \u0001Fig. 10\u0002. Figure 9 shows the experi-\nmental spectra for different external bias voltages \u0001left pic-\nture\u0002. On the right, the corresponding calculated spectra are\nplotted. Again, theory reproduces the main features seen in\nthe measurement, corroborating the offset of +40 meV. In\naddition, the dashed lines in Fig. 9 show calculations for a\nhigher modulation field of 15 kV\/cm, namely the field F\nderived by simply assuming F=U \/d where U is the applied\nbias voltage and d is the width of the undoped layers, i.e., a\nvalue considerably higher than that obtained from the analy-\nsis of the FKOs, see Sec. IV. Their signal magnitudes are\nabout ten times stronger than the magnitudes of the measured\nspectra at 0 and \u22121 V, whereas the magnitudes yielded for\nthe lower modulation field of 4 kV\/cm are comparable to the\nexperimental ones. Also, the relative height and width do not\nFIG. 8. Comparison of experimental \u0001dotted\u0002 and theoretical \u0001solid\u0002 electro-\nabsorption spectra for the sample with 6 nm GaAs spacers. The calculations\nare for different band offsets. The spectra are vertically displaced for clarity.\nThe temperature is T=30 K. Clearly, the line shape changes strongly with\nconfinement in the calculations and shows a good agreement with experi-\nment for the 40 meV type-II offset. The experiment is for an applied voltage\nbias of \u22121 V \u0001flatband\u0002, the theory corresponds to an internal electric field\nvariation of 4 kV\/cm in the vicinity of the flatband situation.\nFIG. 9.

The\ndashed lines show calculations for the\nelectric field we would expect without\nscreening, scaled by a factor of 0.1.\nClearly, theory-experiment agreement\nis better for a small field modulation.\n033118-6 B\u00fcckers et al.

Moreover, the line-\nshapes of the spectra calculated for different modulation\nvoltages differ considerably: For instance, considering the\nfirst resonance for the bottom curve measured at \u22123 V, the\nsignal calculated for the high modulation field clearly shows\na shoulder while the experimental and the lower modulation\nsignal display one clear dip. On the one hand, this demon-\nstrates that the choice of the correct internal field modulation\nis extremely important for obtaining a good agreement with\nthe experimental spectra. On the other hand, this means that\nthe comparison between microscopic theory and experiment\ncan be used to extract further information about the internal\nelectric field in such complicated layered structures,23 which\nis not accessible by an FKO analysis.\nFigure 10 shows an overview of the measured and cal-\nculated EA spectra for the samples with 6, 3, and 2 nm and\nwithout GaAs spacers in the vicinity of the flatband situation\nfor the QW layers. Again, for the reasons discussed earlier,\nthe energy positions of the resonances are slightly different\nin theory and experiment, but more importantly a good\nagreement between the line shapes of experimental and the-\noretical spectra is obtained, verifying the conclusion that the\nsamples are weakly type II. The deviations in linewidth be-\ntween theory and experiment toward higher energies, in par-\nticular for the samples with the thicker spacer layers, is due\nto an increase of the inhomogeneous broadening with energy\nwhich is a commonly observed effect30,31 and is not ac-\ncounted for in the calculation.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nWe investigate a series of GaAs0.65Sb0.35 QW samples\nembedded in Al0.25Ga0.75As with GaAs spacers of different\nwidth \u00010\u20136 nm\u0002 on both sides of the QW. The EA spectra\nwere calculated employing a microscopic theory with no free\nparameters except for a phenomenological inhomogeneous\nbroadening. The line shape of the EA spectra is very sensi-\ntive to the choice of the conduction band offset between\nGaAs and GaAs0.65Sb0.35 as well as to the assumed modula-\ntion of the internal electric field. Comparison of the internal\nelectric field response to applied bias voltage determined by\nanalysis of the FKOs in bulk-like layers and by the analysis\nof the QCSE in the QW region demonstrate that the built-in\nelectric field is inhomogeneous throughout the structure. Ac-\ncounting for the field inhomogeneities by analyzing the EA\nspectra in the vicinity of the flatband situation for the QW\nlayers, we were able to conclude that the band alignment\nbetween GaAs and GaAs0.65Sb0.35 is of type II with a con-\nduction band offset of 40\u00b120 meV at a temperature of 30 K.\nEmploying a full microscopic theory in the analysis of\nmodulation spectra of complex multilayered structures offers\nnew possibilities for extracting band structure and band\nalignment parameters with an accuracy far exceeding that of\nconventional analysis methods based on least-square line\nshape fitting with oscillator models.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors acknowledge funding by the Deutsche\nForschungsgemeinschaft \u0001DFG\u0002 through the research group\n483 \u201cMetastable Compound Semiconductor Systems and\nHeterostructures,\u201d by AFOSR \u0001F49620\u201302\u20131-0380\u0002, the se-\nnior scientist award of the Humboldt foundation, and the\nEPSRC \u0001UK\u0002 for providing funding under Grant No. GR\/\nT21516\/01.\n1K.
