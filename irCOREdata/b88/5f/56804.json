Introduction\nIn our dynamic visual environment, objects and\nscenes often occur and move in statistically predictable\nways. The projection of the visual world onto the retina\ntherefore often reflects measurements of a stream of\nevents which are spatially and temporally coherent.\nConsequently, what we see is not simply an immediate\nreflection of the physical characteristics of a scene but\ninstead is highly dependent on the processes by which\nour brain attempts to interpret the scene. Our visual\nperception, therefore, is the result of an interaction be-\ntween information entering the eyes and mechanisms\nthat relate the incoming information to previous visual\nexperiences and current expectations (Gilbert, 1998).* Corresponding author.

In this\nframework, knowledge of the probability structure of\nthe spatio\u2013temporal dynamics of scenes is likely to be\ninformative for an efficient visual system, and the re-\nsponses of visual neurons and our perceptual sensitivi-\nties should be substantially altered by processing scenes\nfor which the system has prior expectations of dynamics\nor structure. Growing evidence from neurophysiological\ninvestigation suggests that neural systems do make use\nof the probability structure of the real world for the\nefficient information coding (Abbott & Blum, 1996;\nChirimuuta, Clatworthy, & Tolhurst, 2003; Guo et al.,\n2002; Mehta, Quirk, & Wilson, 2000; Sharma, Dragoi,\nTenenbaum, Miller, & Sue, 2003; Yao & Dan, 2001;\nZhang, Ginzburg, McNaughton, & Sejnowski, 1998).

Stimulus demonstration. Five short bars were presented in a\nlinearly ordered spatio\u2013temporal sequence. Four of them (first, second,\nthird and fourth bars) were predictors with the same orientation (45\u0003),\nand one of them (fifth bar) was the target with randomly varied ori-\nentation (35\u201355\u0003 with 1\u0003 increment). Each bar was presented for 200\nms. A small red fixation point (0.15\u0003 diameter) was displayed at the\ncenter of the target.\n2350 K. Guo et al. \/ Vision Research 44 (2004) 2349\u20132358it would be statistically optimal for the brain to compute\nthe Bayesian posterior probability of a scene (percep-\ntion), given the prior probability of the state and the\ncurrent input information from the eye (Poster-\nior\u0001Prior \u00b7Likelihood) (Friston, 2002; Knill & Rich-\nards, 1996; Rao, 1999). Indeed, recent psychophysical\nmeasurements demonstrated that the human perceptual\nperformance to luminance discrimination (Ciaramitaro,\nCameron, & Glimcher, 2001), motion perception\n(Ascher & Grzywacz, 2000; H\u20acurlimann, Kiper, &\nCarandini, 2002; Weiss, Simoncelli, & Adelson, 2002),\ndepth perception (Kersten, Mamassian, & Knill, 1997)\nand object recognition (Liu, Knill, & Kersten, 1995;\nRao, 1999) can be influenced by manipulating the\nprobability structure of visual stimuli, as predicted by\nthe Bayesian perspective.\nHuman observers are extremely effective in judging\nthe orientation of lines (Westheimer, 1990). However,\nwhen measuring foveal orientation sensitivity to a target\nline, previous psychophysical studies have shown that\norientation perception can be manipulated by the spatial\nor temporal arrangement of the target line and sur-\nrounding configurations. For example, when sur-\nrounded by lines at differing orientation, the perceived\norientation of the center line appears to shift in a\ndirection away from that of the surround lines (orien-\ntation contrast effect) (Wenderoth & Johnstone, 1988;\nWestheimer, 1990). The orientation discrimination\nthreshold to the center line can also be markedly raised\nby the surround lines of a similar orientation (Kapadia,\nWestheimer, & Gilbert, 2000; Mareschal, Sceniak, &\nShapley, 2001), even if they are presented a short time\nbefore or after the center line (Wehrhahn, Li, & West-\nheimer, 1996; Westheimer & Ley, 1997). In this experi-\nment, we employed the orientation discrimination\nthreshold as a test parameter to investigate the effect of\nmanipulation of the spatio\u2013temporal prior probability\nof a stimulus on human psychophysical performance,\nand we developed a Bayesian model to account for the\npsychophysical observations.2. Materials and methods\nVisual stimuli, five short bars (1.5\u0003 length, 0.1\u0003 width,\n24 cd\/m2 luminance), were generated using VSG 2\/3\ngraphics system (Cambridge Research Systems) and\ndisplayed on a high frequency non-interlaced gamma-\ncorrected color monitor (110 Hz, 1024 \u00b7 768 pixels\nresolution, Sony GDM-F500T9) with uniform grey\nbackground (6 cd\/m2 luminance). Four co-linear bars\n(predictors 1\u20134) had the same diagonal orientation (45\u0003),\nthe orientation of the fifth bar (target) varied randomly\nfrom 35\u0003 to 55\u0003 with 1\u0003 steps. A small red fixation point\n(FP, 0.15\u0003 diameter, 7.8 cd\/m2 luminance) was displayed\nat the location where the target would appear (Fig. 1).Five volunteers (two of them authors) with normal or\ncorrected-to-normal visual acuity participated as sub-\njects. They were trained for several sessions (normally\n100 trials) before the formal test. During the experi-\nments, the observers sat in a quiet, darkened area en-\nclosed by curtains, and viewed the display binocularly.\nAt a viewing distance of 114 cm the monitor subtended a\nvisual angle of 20\u0003 \u00b7 15\u0003. The trial was started by a 350\nHz warning tone lasting 150 ms followed by a delay of\n1000 ms. The four predictors and target bar were then\npresented on the screen in a highly predictable spatial\nand temporal sequence (predictor 1fi predictor 2fi\npredictor 3fi predictor 4fi target). Each bar was pre-\nsented for 200 ms. There was no spatial and temporal\ninterval between adjacent bars. The bars were flashed in\nturn in a position immediately adjacent (end-to-end) and\nin a time immediately preceding the next bar at succes-\nsive positions. In a given trial, the orientation of the\ntarget was randomly varied \u00b110\u0003 around the predictors\nwith 1\u0003 steps, so the probability of a physically collinear\ntarget was one out of twenty one. The observers were\ninstructed to maintain fixation of the FP throughout the\ntrial, and had to indicate, by pressing one of two keys in\na computer keyboard, whether the target had the same\nor different orientation as the predictors (collinear or\nnon-collinear) after the stimulus presentation. No feed-\nback was given. The chance performance (correct\njudgment of the target orientation) in a given presenta-\ntion was 50%. The trial interval was set to 1500 ms. A\nminimum of 20 trials were presented for each target\norientation. During the experiments, the observers were\nencouraged to have a short break if it was necessary.\nThe observers\u2019 performance (percentage of correct\ntarget orientation judgment) was measured as a function\nK.

A cumulative normal psychometric function was\nfitted to the data of each subject by probit analysis\n(Finney, 1986). The goodness of fit was determined by\ncomputing the chi-square (v2) statistic and probability\nassociated with the hypothesis that the difference be-\ntween data and fit was due to noise. The orientation\ndiscrimination threshold was determined as the point at\nwhich the psychometric function crossed the 75% per-\nformance level. To prevent perceptual learning (train-\ning) or other long-term effects, results in each test were\nalways obtained as a self-contained series even though\nsometimes two series included identical patterns. This\nexplains the several occasions in this study where there\nwere differences between threshold values for the same\nobserver.3. Results\n3.1. Psychophysical observation\nTo establish whether the predictable priors (predic-\ntors) can affect the subjects\u2019 orientation perception, the\norientation discrimination threshold for the target was\nmeasured in three different protocols. (1) Normal se-\nquence: predictors and target were illuminated in a\npredictable spatial and temporal sequence as shown in\nFig. 1. Each bar was presented for 200 ms. (2) Random\norder sequence: predictors and target were illuminated\nin random spatial and temporal sequence. Each bar was\npresented for 200 ms. (3) Random duration sequence:\npredictors and target were illuminated in a predictable\nspatial sequence, and the target bar was presented for\n200 ms, but the presentation time for each predictor was\nvaried randomly between 100 and 500 ms.0\n2\n4\n6\nSubjects\nD\nis\ncr\nim\nin\nat\nio\nn \nTh\nre\nsh\nol\nd \n(\u00b0\n)\nNormal sequence\nRandom order sequence\nRandom duration sequence\nA B\nFig. 2.

Their orientation perception to the target was\nbiased towards the predictors\u2019 orientation. Conse-\nquently, the highest orientation discrimination threshold\n(5.0\u0003\u00b10.21\u0003, Mean\u00b1SEM) was observed under this\ncondition (ANOVA, p < 0:01). Breaking this regularity\ninherent in the priors by randomising illumination order\n(condition 2) or duration (condition 3) reduced the bias\nof the target orientation judgment. The orientation\ndiscrimination thresholds were decreased by 39%\n(3.07\u0003\u00b10.22\u0003) and 20% (4.0\u0003\u00b10.21\u0003) respectively. The\ndifference between discrimination thresholds measured\nunder the conditions of random order and random\nduration sequence also indicates that the spatial regu-\nlarity of the sequence appears to be more critical than\nthe temporal regularity to influence the orientation\nperception of the target.\nClearly, subjects\u2019 orientation perception was influ-\nenced by the regularity of the spatio\u2013temporal priors. In\nother words, prior expectation of co-linearity under the\ntest condition of normal sequence strongly biased the\norientation judgment of the foveal target bar towards\nthat of the predictors. We further investigated whether\nthe probability of the collinear trials can influence the\nsubjects\u2019 performance. If the prior expectation can also\nbe influenced by recent visual experience, a high fre-\nquency collinear trials should reduce subjects\u2019 orienta-\ntion sensitivity to the target. The tests were arranged in\ntwo blocks. In one block, the probability of the target\nhaving the same orientation as the predictors (the\nprobability of the collinear trials) was set at 0%. In the\nsecond block, the probability was set to 50%. In both\nblocks, the predictors and the target were presented in a\npredictable spatial and temporal sequence (normalSubjects\n0\n2\n4\n6\n0% 50%\nnation threshold.

Guo et al. \/ Vision Research 44 (2004) 2349\u20132358sequence). Given that in block one there never was a\ncollinear stimulus (although the subjects were not in-\nformed about this), one would expect to see more \u2018\u2018non-\ncollinear\u2019\u2019 responses if the system was able to sense this\ndifference, i.e. more correct responses and therefore a\nlower threshold. In block two (normal sequence with\n50% collinear trials), the orientation discrimination\nthreshold was calculated only for those trials that are\nnot collinear, so that it is compatible with the threshold\ncalculated from the data sampled in block one (normal\nsequence with 0% collinear trials). The result showed\nthat decreasing the probability of the collinear trials\nsignificantly increased subjects\u2019 orientation sensitivity to\nthe target bar (Fig. 2B), which is consistent with our\nprediction. The mean discrimination threshold de-\ncreased by 20%, from 4.89\u0003\u00b10.29\u0003 to 3.93\u0003\u00b10.3\u0003, when\nthe probability of the collinear trials was decreased from\n50% to 0% (t-test, p < 0:01).\nDuring the trial presentation, the subjects were in-\nstructed to maintain fixation of the fixation point which\nwas presented at the location where the target bar would\nappear. Although we did not monitor the subjects\u2019 eye\nmovements, it is unlikely that the differences among the\norientation discrimination thresholds measured under\ndifferent test conditions were due to eye tracking of\nindividual bars and repeated fovea stimulation (i.e.\norientation adaptation). In fact, a similar or the same\npredictor presentation in different test conditions (i.e.\nnormal sequence vs random duration sequence; normal\nsequence with 0% collinear trials vs normal sequence\nwith 50% collinear trials) yielded statistically different\nresults, which is in disagreement with the difference be-\ntween test conditions being due to adaptation.\nHuman foveal orientation discrimination thresholds\ncan be affected by stimulus length and exposure dur-\nation (Westheimer, 1990; Westheimer & Ley, 1997). To\ndetermine the range of the spatial summation of spatio\u2013\ntemporal priors, we systematically varied the number of\npredictors between 1 and 8, covering between 1.5\u0003 and\n12\u0003 of the visual field. In this experiment, the predictors\nwere always presented in turn preceding the target at\nsuccessive positions that approached the target position\n(normal sequence). For trials containing only one pre-\ndictor, it was presented in a position immediately adja-\ncent and in a time immediately preceding the target; for\ntrials with eight predictors, the first predictor was pre-\nsented at the farthest position away from the target in\nboth space and time. Four subjects\u2019 orientation dis-\ncrimination thresholds to the target were measured as a\nfunction of predictor numbers. On average, the dis-\ncrimination threshold was gradually increased from\n3.70\u0003\u00b10.19\u0003 to 5.28\u0003\u00b10.21\u0003 when the number of the\npredictors was increased from 1 to 8 (ANOVA,\np < 0:01) (Fig. 3A). However, this increasing threshold\nis not associated linearly with the increasing predictor\nnumbers. The threshold increased rapidly (0.29\u0003 perpredictor) when the number of the predictors was\nchanged from 1 to 6. After that, the threshold was close\nto saturation. This result clearly indicates that human\nvisual cortex can effectively integrate briefly presented\norientation signals prior to and distant from the foveal\ntarget bar; in our case, this temporal summation covers\nover 1200 ms and spatial summation extends over 9\u0003 (6\npredictors).\nWe also systematically varied the stimulus duration\nof the predictors and the target (between 100 and 400\nms) to determine the temporal summation of the spa-\ntial\u2013temporal priors. In this experiment, four predictors\nand target were presented in a predictable spatial and\ntemporal sequence (normal sequence). The orientation\ndiscrimination thresholds of four subjects for the target\nwere measured as a function of the presentation dur-\nation (Fig. 3B). The discrimination thresholds were\nmonotonically decreased with the increasing stimulus\nexposure duration (ANOVA, p < 0:01). The mean\nthreshold was 5.37\u0003\u00b10.35\u0003 with 100 ms presentation\nduration, and 3.53\u0003\u00b10.16\u0003 with 400 ms presentation\nduration.3.2. Modeling\nWe further investigated to what extent a Bayesian\nmodel can account for the psychophysical results. In the\ncontext of Bayesian inference (i.e. Knill & Richards,\n1996), if the system\u2019s prior expectation is that collinear\nstimuli are more likely than non-collinear ones, the\nperceived orientation of the target will be biased to-\nwards that of the predictors. We expect that the expec-\ntation for a collinear target will be higher (sharper prior\ndistribution) when the predictors\u2019 sequence resembles a\nnatural sequence which is well defined and predictable\n(i.e. normal sequence). Likewise, an increase in the\nexperimental frequency of collinear trials (i.e. 50% col-\nK. Guo et al. \/ Vision Research 44 (2004) 2349\u20132358 2353linear trials condition) may produce an analogous in-\ncrease in the system\u2019s prior expectations.\nIn our model, we consider three orientation differ-\nences between the predictors and the target: (1) The real\n(physical) orientation difference h, (2) the representation\nof this orientation difference in the brain hr, which is\nsubject to noise, before taking into account the prior\nprobabilities, and (3) the perceived orientation difference\nhp, which is based on hr and the priors.\nIn the Bayesian framework, the probability q\u00f0hjhr\u00de of\na real orientation difference h given the brain represen-\ntation of that difference hr can be expressed as the\nproduct of the prior expectation q\u00f0h\u00de times the likeli-\nhood of the representation given the real difference\nq\u00f0hrjh\u00de.\nq\u00f0hjhr\u00de \u00bc 1k q\u00f0h\u00deq\u00f0hrjh\u00de \u00f01\u00de\nwhere k is a normalisation constant. The system esti-\nmates the real orientation difference between predictors\nand target h based on the noisy representation of this\norientation difference by the brain hr and the prior\nexpectations. We assume that this representation, which\nis defined by the likelihood, is subject to Gaussian noise.\nq\u00f0hrjh\u00de \u00bc G\u00f0hr \u0006 h; rl\u00de \u00f02\u00de\nG\u00f0x; r\u00de \u00bc 1ffiffiffiffiffi\n2p\np\nr\nexp\n\u0002\n\u0006 x\n2\n2r2\n\u0003\n\u00f03\u00de\nwhere G\u00f0x; r\u00de represents a Gaussian function of argu-\nment x and standard deviation r. The confidence in the\nsensory representation increases as the width of the\nlikelihood rl, the noise, decreases.\nSince co-linearity commonly occurs in natural set-\ntings (Geisler, Perry, Super, & Gallogly, 2001; Sigman,\nCecchi, Gilbert, & Magnasco, 2001), the visual system\nmay assign a higher prior probability to the collinear\nstimuli. We take the distribution of prior probability as\na Gaussian centered at 0\u0003 orientation difference:\nq\u00f0h\u00de \u00bc G\u00f0h\u0006 0; rp\u00de \u00f04\u00de\nThe smaller the width of the prior rp the higher the\nprior expectation of a collinear target is, and therefore,\nthe closer to collinear the perceived orientation differ-\nence hp between the predictors and the target will be.\nSubstituting Eqs. (2) and (4) in Eq. (1) we obtain the\nprobability of a perceived orientation difference given\nthe representation of the orientation difference before\ntaking the priors into account. The perceived orientation\ndifference can be estimated as the maximum or the\naverage of this posterior probability. In our case both\nvalues coincide.\nhp \u00bc\nr2phr\nr2p \u00fe r21\n\u00f05\u00deThis expression gives us the estimated perceived ori-\nentation difference hp for each possible representation of\nthe real difference hr. Therefore there is a deterministic\nrelationship between hp and hr. On the other hand, due\nto noise, each real difference h gives rise to a distribution\nof representations q\u00f0hrjh\u00de (Eq. (2)) and therefore it is\nalso associated with a distribution of perceived orien-\ntation differences q\u00f0hpjh\u00de:\nq\u00f0hpjh\u00de \u00bc q\u00f0hrjh\u00de dhr\ndhp\n\u00f06\u00de\nFrom Eqs.

As explained before,\nwe assume that the differences in responses for different\nconditions can be explained by differences in prior\nexpectations associated to each type of predictor.\nTherefore the five fits are constrained to have the same\nwidth of likelihood rl and collinearity threshold ht while\nhaving their own individual prior width rp. Clearly, the\nmodel fits well with this subject\u2019s psychophysical data.\nThe prior width rp shows clear differences among test\nconditions of normal sequence, random order sequence\nand random duration sequence (Fig. 4A), and between\nFig. 4.

The fact that the experimental\npoints reach 100% for 0\u0003 orientation difference under\nsome test conditions is peculiar to the subject chosen as\nan example. For other subjects slightly different values\nwere found.\nSimilar goodness of fit was found for the other sub-\njects. Fig. 5A presents the value of the width of prior rp\nfor different test conditions, and Fig. 5B shows the\nvalues of the width of likelihood rl, co-linearity\nthreshold ht, and distance between psychophysical data\nand fitted model v2. This distance is shown for com-\nparative purposes only, since the error bars are arbi-\ntrary. Grey bars represent the parameter values for\nindividual subjects and black bar represents the averageparameter value across subjects. Compared with the test\nconditions of random order sequence and random\nduration sequence, the prior distribution is the sharpest\nfor the normal sequence (average rp \u00bc 1:59; Fig. 5A). It\nis for this condition that subjects more often perceived\nthe stimulus as collinear. For the random duration se-\nquence, the prior distribution takes an intermediate\nwidth (average rp \u00bc 1:93), and it is the broadest for the\nrandom order sequence (average rp \u00bc 3:51). The differ-\nences between all three conditions were significant\n(Paired t-test, p < 0:05). This is consistent with our\nexpectation that predictor sequences which resemble\nnatural sequences are associated with sharper priors.\nLikewise, a comparison of the normal sequence with\n0% collinear trials (average rp \u00bc 2:09) and 50% collinear\ntrials (average rp \u00bc 1:61) shows that the prior distribu-\ntion is sharper for higher frequency collinear trials (Fig.\n5A, Paired t-test, p < 0:05). These prior expectations\nbias perception more strongly towards co-linearity.\nAgain, this is to be expected if we think that prior\nexpectations are influenced by sensory experience.\nThese results are consistent with the orientation dis-\ncrimination threshold analysis (Fig. 2), in which sub-\nject\u2019s orientation perception for the target bar was more\noften biased towards the orientation of the predictors\nunder the test condition of normal sequence with 50%\ncollinear trials. Clearly, larger discrimination thresholds\ncorrespond to sharper prior distributions.\nIn summary, a simple Bayesian model, which assumes\nthat collinear stimuli are more likely a priori, and that\nneuronal representations are subject to a certain level\nof noise, can account for our psychophysical data. A\npredictable spatio\u2013temporal stimulus structure and an\nincreased frequency of collinear trials were both asso-\nciated with an increase in the prior expectation of col-\nlinear events, and, consequently, with the perception of\nK. Guo et al. \/ Vision Research 44 (2004) 2349\u20132358 2355the target\u2019s orientation being more strongly biased to-\nwards that of the predictors.4. Discussion\nIt is well known that the discrimination of the orient-\nation of a line in the human fovea can be modulated by\nthe spatial or temporal arrangement of the surround-\ning configurations (e.g. Wenderoth & Johnstone, 1988;\nWestheimer, 1990; Westheimer & Ley, 1997). For\nexample, when two co-presented flanking lines are\npositioned in a collinear arrangement with the central\ntarget line, the target appears tilted towards the flanks\nand the subjects\u2019 orientation discrimination threshold to\nthe target is elevated (Kapadia et al., 2000). The orien-\ntation discrimination can also be impaired if the foveal\ntarget line is followed immediately by a surround mask\nof various configurations (Wehrhahn et al., 1996),\nespecially if the mask composes of lines with the same\norientation as the target (Li, Thier, & Wehrhahn, 2000).\nOur experiments demonstrated that human orienta-\ntion perception can also be modulated by the condi-\ntional prior probability of a spatio\u2013temporal predictor\nstimulus. The orientation discrimination to a foveal\ntarget bar was significantly biased towards the orienta-\ntion of the predictors presented in discrete spatial and\ntemporal sequence. The discrimination threshold was\nfurther elevated with increasing probability of the col-\nlinear trials and number of predictors. These results\nsuggest that the human visual cortex can effectively\nintegrate orientation signals over a range of spatial and\ntemporal positions, and this integrated perceptual sen-\nsitivity can be modulated by spatio\u2013temporal prior\nprobability of stimuli, as suggested by Bayesian infer-\nence.\nTwo relatively simple interpretations, masking effect\nand spatio\u2013temporal proximity of flanker interaction,\nmay partly account for the differences in orientation\ndiscrimination threshold to the target measured under\ntest conditions of normal sequence, random order se-\nquence and random duration sequence (Fig. 2A). Re-\nsults of psychophysical masking experiments revealed\nthat the presence of adjacent high-contrast collinear\nflankers (masks) can elevate the contrast discrimination\nthreshold to the center target (Adini & Sagi, 2001; Chen\n& Tyler, 2002; Foley, 1994; Zenger & Koch, 2001),\nsuggesting a localised spatial and temporal interaction\nbetween the flankers and the target. Furthermore, the\norientation discrimination threshold to the center target\nis markedly raised by the collinear flankers co-presented\nwith the target or presented a short time before or after\nthe target (Kapadia et al., 2000; Mareschal et al., 2001;\nWehrhahn et al., 1996; Westheimer & Ley, 1997). This\ncontextual effect can extend spatially to 1\u0003 (Mareschal\net al., 2001) and is most pronounced for a temporalonset asynchrony of around 100 ms (Westheimer & Ley,\n1997). As the predictor bar used in our experiment has a\nlength of 1.5\u0003 and a presentation duration of 200 ms, it\nseems that the final judgment of the target orientation\ndepends on the last predictor presented in a position\nimmediately adjacent and in a time immediately pre-\nceding the target (predictor 4 in Fig. 1). Comparing to\nnormal sequence, in random order sequence and ran-\ndom duration sequence there was much less spatio and\ntemporal proximity between the last predictor and the\ntarget. Consequently, the masking effect is reduced and\nthe orientation discrimination threshold to the target is\nless impaired. However, the spatio\u2013temporal proximity\nof flanker interaction and flanker masking effect can not\nfully interpret the results related to the experiments of\nvarying the probability of the collinear trials (Fig. 2B)\nand varying the number of the predictors (Fig. 3A)\nwithout involving further processing in the visual sys-\ntem. In these two experiments, for a given trial, there\nwas always a collinear flank presented immediately\nadjacent and preceding the target. The subject\u2019s orien-\ntation discrimination threshold for the target, however,\nwas increased with increasing probability of the collin-\near trials and number of the predictors. Therefore, al-\nthough the spatio\u2013temporal interaction between the\ntarget and the last predictor, presented next to and\nimmediately before the target, can contribute to the\ntarget orientation perception, the final elaboration of the\ntarget\u2019s orientation critically depend on the ability to\nsense spatio\u2013temporal prior probability of stimulus or\nstimulus statistics. We have suggested a simple Bayesian\nmodel, based on the prior expectation of collinear\nevents, and we show that this model can account par-\nsimoniously for the full pattern of results we see (see\nfurther discussion in \u2018\u2018Bayesian inference\u2019\u2019).\n4.1. Possible mechanism\nAlthough the process of visuospatial integration has\nbeen traditionally ascribed to high-order cortical visual\nareas, there is growing evidence suggesting that the\nprimary visual cortex (area V1) may play an important\nrole as well. Orientation selective neurons in area V1\nprovide the basis for the elaboration of the \u2018orientation\u2019\nattribute of stimuli, and their orientation selectivity\nshows remarkable plasticity to complex temporal or\nspatial stimulus dynamics. Temporally, paired visual\nstimuli at different orientations can induce a shift in a\nneuron\u2019s orientation tuning (Dragoi, Sharma, & Sur,\n2000; Muller, Metha, Krauskopf, & Lennie, 1999), the\ndirection of shift depends on the temporal order of the\npair and could be linked to the perceptual level (Yao &\nDan, 2001). Spatially, the oriented stimuli co-presented\noutside the classical receptive field (CRF) have a power-\nful modulatory influence on neurons\u2019 orientation selec-\ntivity to stimuli inside the CRF (Gilbert, Das, Ito,\n2356 K. Guo et al. \/ Vision Research 44 (2004) 2349\u20132358Kapadia, & Westheimer, 1996; Knierim & Van Essen,\n1992; Levitt & Lund, 1997; Sillito, Grieve, Jones,\nCudeiro, & Davis, 1995). This modulated contextual\ninteraction could likely be the neural basis for the in-\ncreased human orientation discrimination threshold for\nsimilar stimuli (Gilbert & Wiesel, 1990; Kapadia et al.,\n2000; Li et al., 2000).\nUsing similar stimuli to the ones presented to human\nsubjects, our electrophysiological recording from mon-\nkeys showed that the orientation responses of a sub-\nstantial population of V1 neurons were significantly\nmodulated by events (predictors) prior to and distant\nfrom stimulation (target) of their CRFs (Guo et al.,\n2002; Pulgarin et al., 2003). Therefore, the final elabo-\nration of the orientation attribute for the target line may\ndepend on the confluence of signals from neurons whose\nCRFs have the same orientation selectivity but whose\nlocations are arrayed along the direction of the line.\nAlthough feedback from extrastriate areas may play a\nrole, the long-range horizontal connection in area V1\nwhich tend to connect cells with similar orientation\npreferences (Gilbert & Wiesel, 1990; Lamme, Super, &\nSpekreijse, 1998) could be a strong candidate for the\nanatomical substrate. As it has the ability to provide\nboth excitatory and inhibitory inputs to their postsyn-\naptic neurons and thus modulate their discharges\n(McGuire, Gilbert, Rivlin, & Wiesel, 1991), the orient-\nation selective signals over a range of spatial positions\ncan be pooled effectively.\n4.2. Bayesian inference\nVisual scenes are predictable, since they are both\nspatially and temporally redundant. In a visual world in\nwhich visual stimuli, and their co-appearances, do not\nappear with equal probability, it would be statistically\noptimal for the visual system to compute the Bayesian\nposterior probability of a feature, based on information\nfrom the eye, and prior knowledge of the statistical\nstructure of the visual world (Friston, 2002; Knill &\nRichards, 1996; Rao, 1999; Young, 2000). This Bayesian\nperspective has been successfully implemented to deal\nwith the dynamical aspects of real sensory inputs, such\nas luminance discrimination (Ciaramitaro et al., 2001),\nmotion perception (Ascher & Grzywacz, 2000; H\u20acurli-\nmann et al., 2002; Weiss et al., 2002), depth perception\n(Kersten et al., 1997) and object recognition (Kersten &\nYuille, 2003; Liu et al., 1995; Rao, 1999).\nThe statistical structure of the visual world is reflected\nin a number of regularities commonly shared by natural\nscenes and images. One of these regularities is that the\nco-occurrence of line segments is characterised by a\ngreater probability density for collinear line segments\nthan for non-collinear ones (Geisler et al., 2001; Sigman\net al., 2001). Furthermore, during normal vision, the\nvisual system frequently has \u2018reason to believe\u2019 that aparticular feature is present at a particular location,\nbecause of the spatial structure of the current scene, the\ntemporal structure of its evolution over time, and prior\nknowledge of the structure of the visual world (Young,\n2000). These regularities of colinearity and predictable\nspatio\u2013temporal dynamics of visual scenes should be\nknown to the visual system, and they should be exploi-\nted for efficient coding by reflecting themselves in dis-\ntributions of prior probability.\nIn this experiment, we demonstrated that the sys-\ntematic changes in spatio\u2013temporal prior probability of\noriented predictors lead to systematic changes in human\norientation discrimination to the foveal target bar,\nproviding a psychometric function for the influence of\nspatio\u2013temporal prior probability on perceptual sensi-\ntivity. These psychophysical observations can be pre-\ndicted by a Bayesian model which assumes that collinear\nstimuli are more likely a priori and that neuronal rep-\nresentations are subject to a certain level of noise. A\npredictable spatio\u2013temporal stimulus structure, the\npredictors presented in normal sequence which more\nclosely resembles a natural scene, such as the trajectory\nof a moving object, is associated with the increasing\nprior expectation of collinear events (sharper width of\nprior, rp). Consequently, the subjects\u2019 orientation per-\nception of the target bar is more strongly biased towards\nthat of the predictors. The variability introduced in the\nrandom duration sequence, and especially, in the ran-\ndom order sequence, makes the stimulus structure less\nnatural, and therefore, it comes as no surprise that they\nare associated with a broader prior distribution.\nThe frequency of co-linearity of the priors and the\ntarget are directly manipulated in the 50% collinear\ntrials and 0% collinear trials blocks. Interestingly,\nmanipulating these frequencies experimentally also\nyields a change in the prior distribution in the expected\ndirection. An increased probability of collinear trials is\nassociated with a sharper prior distribution.\nThe two effects, change in prior distribution for dif-\nferent spatio\u2013temporal structures and for different col-\nlinear frequencies, can be accounted for by the same\nBayesian model. Nevertheless, it is possible that these\neffects are mediated by different mechanisms or brain\nareas. The first one probably depends on the statistics of\nnatural images and is probably embedded in the system\npermanently. The relative lower visual areas in the\nhierarchical visual system, such as area V1 as discussed\nabove, may provide sufficient information for the orient-\nation perception. The second one depends on the recent\nvisual experience and the final perception may involve\nsome higher cortical areas.\nOur model is based on three assumptions: (1) collin-\near targets are more likely; (2) there is noise in the brain\nrepresentation of the orientation difference; and (3) the\ndifferences in responses for different conditions can be\nexplained by differences in prior probability distribu-\nK. Guo et al. \/ Vision Research 44 (2004) 2349\u20132358 2357tions. Other authors (e.g. Weiss et al., 2002) introduce\nthe noise formally in the input, although they then dis-\ncuss how neural noise may play a similar role. In our\ncase given the simplicity of our stimulus it seems more\nnatural to conceptually assign the noise to the neural\nrepresentation.\nIn the same way, the fact that there is a distribution\nof responses to a fixed stimulus may arise from different\nsources. Weiss et al. (2002) place this variability in the\ndecision stage. Mamassian and Landy (1998) propose\nthat responses may follow a probability which matches\nthe posterior probability. In our case the variability\narises for the distribution of representations for each\nparticular stimulus, and is associated to the likelihood\nfunction. This approach has the attractive feature that it\ndoes not introduce new hypotheses or free parameters.\nBoth the width of the likelihood and the co-linearity\nthreshold are related to the orientation sensitivity in the\nabsence of priors. It is reassuring to find that, in the\nmodel, both parameters have similar values.Acknowledgements\nThis work is supported by Wellcome Trust, HFSPO\nand EU FP5.References\nAbbott, L. F., & Blum, K.
