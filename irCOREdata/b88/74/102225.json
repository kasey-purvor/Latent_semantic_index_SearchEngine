A future \npriority is the development of the next generation alkaline ionomer. \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe vast majority of research into solid\u2013state polymer electrolytes for low temperature \nfuel cells has focused on proton\u2013exchange membranes (PEM), commonly Nafion\u00ae by \nDuPont (USA), in proton\u2013exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Recently, there has \nbeen increasing interest in the application of anion\u2013exchange membranes (AEM), in \nalkaline\u2013form, in low temperature fuel cells (1). Figure 1 compares the operation of fuel \ncells with these two types of ionic polymer electrolyte membranes. These alkaline anion\u2013\nexchange membranes (AAEM) conduct negatively charged anions, including hydroxide \n(OH\u2013), rather than cations such as protons (H+). Alkaline fuel cells (AFC), which \ntraditionally utilize caustic aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a cheap electrolyte, \nare promising on a cost basis mainly because cheap and relatively abundant non\u2013\nplatinum\u2013group\u2013metals (non\u2013PGM) are viable catalysts (the in situ durability of these \ncatalysts is still be investigated). Catalyst electrokinetics (for fuel oxidation and oxygen \nreduction) is also improved in alkaline, as opposed to acidic, conditions (2). However, \nthere are concerns that the presence of carbon dioxide (in the air supply or as a product of \nthe oxidation of carbon\u2013containing fuels) will lead to performance losses due to the \nformation in the aqueous alkaline electrolyte of less ionically conductive, and less basic, \nbicarbonate (HCO3\u2013) and carbonate (CO32\u2013) anions (3). \n \nThe replacement of the KOH(aq) electrolyte with an AAEM in AFCs (with \nelimination of metal cations) retains the electrocatalytic advantages but introduces CO2 \ntolerance with the additional advantage of being an all solid state fuel cell (4). For \nexample, it has been reported that Acta SpA (Italy) have developed non\u2013PGM catalysts \nfor alkaline membrane fuel cells (with reports of plans to make these fuel cell disposable \nwhen used with ethanol fuel) (5\u20137). Anion\u2013exchange membranes are solid polymer \nelectrolyte membranes that contain positive ionic groups (typically quaternary \nammonium groups: \u2014N+Me3) and mobile negatively charged anions. Commercial AEMs \nare available from Solvay (Belgium \u2013 Morgane\u00ae ADP), Fumatech (Germany \u2013 FAA) and \nTokuyama (Japan \u2013 typical fuel cell applicable examples being Neosepta\u00ae AHA and a \nnew AAEM called A006) (8\u201310). Radiation\u2013grafted AAEMs have been developed at \nSurrey (see Scheme 1) (11). This simple synthetic methodology allows for the fabrication \nof AAEMs, of different thicknesses and ion\u2013exchange capacities, from preformed \ncommercially available polymer films such as poly(ethylene\u2013co\u2013tetrafluoroethylene), \nETFE, and therefore avoids the need for a film formation step. The aim was not to \ndevelop a commercial product, but to produce membranes that allowed for experiments \nto be conducted that would lead to fundamental insights into how AAEM properties and \ntheir performances in fuel cells are related. \n \n \n \nFigure 1.  A comparison of PEM and AAEM containing fuel cells \n \nTo allow for the AAEMs to be incorporated into alkaline membrane electrode \nassemblies (MEA) for alkaline polymer electrolyte fuel cells (APEFC) that contain no \nmetal cations, it is essential to employ an alkaline ionomer analogue to the acidic Nafion\u00ae \ndispersions that are traditionally employed in PEMFCs (12). The incorporation of a first \ngeneration alkaline ionomer (Scheme 2) into a H2\/O2 fuel cell operated at 50 \u00b0C \ncontaining Solvay\u2019s ADP membrane led to an increased power density of 50 mW cmgeo\u20132 \ncompared to < 2 mW cmgeo\u20132 for an alkaline\u2013MEA containing no ionomer (all electrodes \nwere identical and supplied by E\u2013Tek (BASF) and contained Type\u2013A carbon cloth gas \ndiffusion layer and Pt in the catalyst layer and using a PTFE binder of proprietary \nloading). This clearly shows the need for an alkaline ionomer. As will be discussed in \ndetail later, this first generation alkaline ionomer is not an optimal material for future \ncommercial development (scaled\u2013up production); however, it was developed with the \nintended purpose of allowing different AAEMs and electrodes to be tested in H2 fuel cells \nwith acceptable performances and it achieved this initial aim well. For information, \nalkaline ionomer concepts from Fumatech and Tokuyama for use in fuel cells have \nrecently been reported (9\u201310). \n \nThis paper (and the associated presentation at the 214th ECS Meeting) will present the \nlatest developments in the application of AAEMs in APEFCs at Surrey. \n \n \nSummary of Experimental Methods \n \nBelow is a quick summary of the experimental details. More in depth details can be found \nin prior published works (11, 13\u201316). \n \n \n \nScheme 1.  The synthesis of radiation\u2013grafted AAEMs \n \nPreparation of Materials \n \nMembranes. ETFE films of 12 \u00b5m, 25 \u00b5m and 50 \u00b5m thicknesses, and supplied either \nby Goodfellow (UK) or Nowofol Kunststoffprodukte (Germany), were irradiated with \nhigh dose rate electron\u2013beams (4, 4, and 7 MRad total doses respectively). These were \nthen submerged in nitrogen purged vinylbenzyl chloride monomer (VBC, used as \nreceived with no removal of inhibitors, supplied by Dow Chemicals, Germany) at 60 \u00b0C \nfor at least 48 h. After thorough washing with toluene solvent and subsequent drying, the \nintermediate ETFE\u2013g\u2013poly(VBC) were submerged in aqueous trimethylamine (50%mass, \nAcros) for 6 h. The Cl\u2013\u2013form AEMs were obtained after thorough washing in water and \nheat treatment in water at 70 \u00b0C. Conversion to alkaline form to obtain the desired \nAAEM was via ion\u2013exchange in KOH(aq, 1 mol dm\u20133) for 1 h (with 2 changes of \nsolution during this time) and subsequent thorough washing with water. Grade\u2013I \ndeionised water was used for all synthetic steps. Scheme 1 presents a graphical \nrepresentation of the synthetic pathway and Table I presents the typical properties of the \nAAEMs produced (designated S20, S50 and S80 respectively). \n \nTABLE I.  Typical values for select properties of radiation\u2013grafted AAEMs.  \nAAEM Dry Thicknesses \/ \u00b5m Fully HydratedThicknesses \/ \u00b5m Ion\u2013Exchange Capacity \/ \nmmol(OH\u2013) \/ g\u20131(dry AAEM) \nS20 15 18 2.25 \nS50 38 46 1.15 \nS80 63 80 1.28 \n \nElectrodes. For the benchmark H2\/O2 50 \u00b0C tests, prefabricated electrodes from E-\nTek (a division of BASF) were used for both the anode and the cathodes. These contained \nPt\/VulcanXC\u201372(20%mass) catalyst at 0.5 mgPt cmgeo\u20132 loadings and were bound to one \nside of either Toray carbon paper or Type\u2013A carbon cloth gas diffusion backing layers \nusing PTFE binder (proprietary loadings). Before incorporation into MEAs for fuel cells, \nthese prefabricated electrodes were sprayed with poly(vinylbenzyl chloride), dissolved in \nethyl acetate, to get a typical loading of 0.5 mgpolymer cmgeo\u20132 (13); these treated electrodes, \nafter evaporation of the solvent in air, were then submerged in N,N,N',N'\u2013\ntetramethylhexane\u20131,6\u2013diamine (TMHDA, undiluted: caution \u2013 toxic), washed with \nwater and then ion\u2013exchanged in KOH(aq, 1 mol dm\u20133) as with the synthesis of the \nAAEMs. A schematic of the resulting alkaline ionomer (designated SION1) is shown \nbelow in Scheme 2. \n \n \n \nScheme 2.  Surrey\u2019s first generation alkaline ionomer (SION1) \n \nCathodes with alternative catalysts have also been tested and compared (all anodes \nconsisted of the treated prefabricated carbon cloth electrodes described above) (16). \nThese cathodes are synthesized by mixing the catalyst powders with poly(VBC) in ethyl \nacetate to form an ink and painting onto one side of a Toray carbon paper (TGPH\u2013090) \nsubstrate; the cathodes are then treated with TMHDA and KOH(aq) as above. A typical \nloading of poly(VBC) of 0.7 mgpolymer cmgeo\u20132 was used. The nature of the catalyst \npowders and their loadings are described in the main text where appropriate. \n \nFuel Cell Testing \n \nThe AAEMs and SION1 treated electrodes were assembled in a 25 cm2 fuel cell \nfixture with a torque of 5.5 N m; prior hot\u2013pressing to form a MEA was not conducted as \nthe electrodes, once treated with SION1, do not laminate consistently. The H2\/O2 fuel cell \ntests were conducted at 50 \u00b0C using an Arbin Fuel Cell Test Station (16); note this \ntemperate was chosen for Surrey\u2019s benchmark tests as SION1 starts to degrade at 60 \u00b0C \nand not because of the instability of the AAEMs, which are chemically stable in KOH(aq, \n1 mol dm\u20133) up to 80 \u00b0C. The H2 and O2 gases were supplied to the anode and cathode \nrespectively with dew points of 50 \u2013 51 \u00b0C at flow rates of 2 dm3 min\u20131 (12 mmol(H2O) \nmin\u20131 is being supplied to the cathode, which is enough water to support a current of 1.68 \nA cmgeo\u20132 assuming no water is crossing over from the anode). The supply pipes between \nthe dew point humidifiers and the fuel cell fixture were kept above the dew points to \nprevent premature condensation and loss of humidity control. Beginning of life cell \nvoltage (Vcell \/ V) and geometric power density (P \/ mW cmgeo\u20132) versus geometric current \ndensity (i \/ mA cmgeo\u20132) plots were recorded from high current density to open circuit \nafter a 2 \u2013 3 h conditioning step where the fuel cell was discharged at high currents (by \ncontrolling the discharge at Vcell = 50 mV). The cell internal area resistances (r \/ \u2126 \ncmgeo2) at each current density were obtained by measuring the high frequency \nimpedance at a phase angle \u03c6 = 0\u00b0 between the a.c. sinusoidal current and voltage signals \nusing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The Solartron 1260\/1287 combined \nelectrochemical tests system was set to floating and was connected in parallel to the d.c. \ncurrent loop running through the Arbin test system. This simple method is suitable at \ncurrent densities below 1 A cmgeo\u20132 but tends to overestimate the internal resistances at \nhigher current densities; however, it is useful as the entire bandwidth of the impedance \nanalyzer (1 MHz upper frequency limit in this case) can be used (13,16,17). \n \n \nResults and Discussion \n \nAAEM Properties \n \nGravimetric water uptakes, WU = 100% \u00d7 (mh \u2013 md) \/ md where mh = mass of the \nfully hydrated AAEM and md = mass of the fully dehydrated AAEM, are typically in the \nrange 35 \u2013 55% for the radiation\u2013grafted AAEMs. Table I presents the typical \nthicknesses and strong base ion\u2013exchange capacities (IEC). Note: the e\u2013beamed ETFE is \ngrafted without pre\u2013weighing as we have found this leads to slightly better \nreproducibility between batches of AAEM; IEC, as opposed to degree of grafting, is used \nas a fundamental characterization property of the membranes. There is generally a \n\u201csweet\u2013spot\u201d between IEC = 0.9 \u2013 1.4 mmol(OH\u2013) g\u20131(dry AAEM) where lower IECs \nlead to poor conductivities and higher IECs compromise physical integrity. An earlier \nbatch of S50 (data not shown), where the 25 \u00b5m base ETFE was e\u2013beamed to 7 MRad \n(70 kGy) total dose, had a highly variable IEC (over the area of the AAEM batch) with an \naverage of over 2 mmol g\u20131; this batch of S50 also exhibited pockets of water below the \nmembrane surface along with some pitting. This problem was solved by lowering the \ntotal radiation dose to 4 MRad. It is not unexpected that the synthesis condition \/ AAEM \nproperty relationships will be a function of the membrane thickness. S20 synthesized by \nbeaming 12 \u00b5m ETFE with a total dose of 4 MRad had an IEC of 2.25 mmol g\u20131 but this \ndid not lead to formation of water pockets. \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  The ionic conductivities of select fully hydrated (submerged in liquid water) \nS80 (squares), S50 (circles) and Tokuyama Neosepta\u00ae AHA \u201cordinary\u201d AAEM \n(triangles) as determined using 2\u2013probe (through membrane) EIS.  \n \nThe ionic conductivities of the fully hydrated AAEMs increase with temperature as \nexpected. S80 consistently exhibits a higher conductivity compared to S50, which is \nunexpected as the similar chemistries should lead to similar conductivities. For third \nparty verification, the in situ conductivity of a sample of S80 has been determined by \nJohnson Matthey; values around 0.06 S cm\u20131 at 60 \u00b0C were recorded. The conductivities \nof a commercially available AAEM sample, in this case Tokuyama\u2019s Neosepta\u00ae AHA \n(230 \u00b5m thick and with fiber reinforcement), is also included for comparison. \nMeasurements to determine the dependency of the conductivities on different synthesized \nS20 and S50 batches are ongoing (including S20 batches synthesized from a different \nsupplier of ETFE). The ionic conductivities are lower when the AAEM is equilibrated in \na relative humidity (RH) = 100% atmosphere rather than being submerged in water; for \nexample, S80 has at conductivity at RH=100% and 30 \u00b0C of 0.022 S cm\u20131. Conductivities \ndrop to unacceptable levels when the AAEMs are equilibrated at even lower RHs (14); \nthis is due to the lower dissociation constant for \u2013NMe3OH groups (requiring a higher \nnumber of water molecules for complete dissociation) compared to \u2013SO3H groups in \nPEMs, and a very low number of water molecules directly associated with the ionic \ngroups (18,19); even at higher humidities, a lot of the water present in AAEMs is located \nin aggregates that are not directly associated with the ionic groups. DFT calculations, on \nmodel quaternary ammonium compounds, indicate that the stability of quaternary \nammonium hydroxide groups is also lower when then membranes are not in the fully \nhydrated state (20). \n \nH2\/O2 Fuel Cell Tests with Commercial E-Tek Prefabricated Pt\/C Electrodes \n \nThe performances in fuel cells at 50 \u00b0C of S20, S50 and S80 with carbon paper \nelectrodes are compared in Figure 3. A peak power density of 230 mW cmgeo\u20132 was \nobtained with S20 at a current density of 600 mA cmgeo\u20132 (Vcell = 382 mV). A current \ndensity of 290 mA cmgeo\u20132 at a Vcell = 0.6 V (important operating efficiency lower limit) \nand 1.32 A cmgeo\u20132 was obtained at full cell discharge. The move to using carbon paper \ngas diffusion layers for both the anodes and cathodes led to an increase in peak power \ndensities compared to when carbon cloth based electrodes were used (Figure 4). Note: a \nproportion of the observed currents result from the carbon support material (16). \n \n \n \nFigure 3.  The performances of S80 (squares), S50 (triangles) and S20 (circles) obtained \nin H2\/O2 fuel cells at 50 \u00b0C (2 dm3 min\u20131 fully hydrated gas flows and no back \npressurization) with AAEMs of various fully hydrated thicknesses and Toray carbon \npaper based prefabricated E-Tek Pt\/C(20%mass) 0.5 mgPt cmgeo\u20132 loaded electrodes. All \nelectrodes were treated with SION1 alkaline ionomer. Cell voltage data is represented by \nthe filled symbols and power density data is represented by the hollow symbols. \n \nThe fuel cell reactions and standard potentials for H2\/O2 fuel cells containing a \nAAEM (Equations 1 \u2013 2) and a PEM (Equation 3 \u2013 4) are compared below (assuming 4 \ne\u2013 oxygen reduction) [note: the sign of the reaction potentials, Eo, for anode reactions \nbelow are reversed as they are written as oxidation reactions]: \n \nAnode: 2H2 + 4OH\u2013 \u2192 4H2O + 4e\u2013  Eo = + 0.83 V vs. SHE (298.15 K)   [1] \nCathode: O2 + 2H2O + 4e\u2013 \u2192 4OH\u2013  Eo = + 0.40 V vs. SHE (298.15 K)   [2] \nAnode : 2H2 \u2192 4H+ + 4e\u2013  Eo = 0.00 V vs. SHE (298.15 K)   [3] \nCathode: O2 + 4e\u2013 + 4H+ \u2192 2H2O Eo = + 1.23 V vs. SHE (298.15 K)   [4] \n \n \n \nFigure 4.  The peak power densities obtained in H2\/O2 fuel cells at 50 \u00b0C with AAEMs of \nvarious fully hydrated thicknesses and either carbon cloth (squares) and carbon paper \n(diamonds) based prefabricated E-Tek Pt\/C(20%mass) 0.5 mgPt cmgeo\u20132 loaded electrodes. \nAll electrodes were treated with SION1. The fuel cell test conditions were the same as \ndescribed in the caption of Figure 3. The 153 \u00b5m thick membrane is Solvay\u2019s Morgane\u00ae \nADP membrane. The lines are guides to the eye only. \n \nThe performances increase on decreasing AAEM thicknesses; the current hypothesis \nis that crossover of water from the anode (where water is electro\u2013generated) to the \ncathode (where water molecules are required to produce the OH\u2013 conductive ions on \nreaction with O2 gas molecules) is enhanced with the thinner AAEMs. A poor supply of \nreactant water to the cathode will manifest itself as an increased mass transport derived \noverpotential; mass transport losses in PEMs are normally associated with poor oxygen \ndiffusion in the cathode, especially when flooding is occurring (water is electro\u2013\ngenerated at the cathode for PEMs). The ir\u2013corrected cell voltage data is presented in \nFigure 5 and this indicates that mass transport related voltages losses onset at higher \ncurrent densities with S20. This is fully consistent with prior observations, which used \ncarbon cloth based anodes with both carbon cloth and carbon paper based cathodes \n(11,16). It is clear that the increased performance does not stem from changes in AAEM \nresistance. The cell resistance data indicates that the in situ area resistance of the S20 \nmembrane is higher than the S50 AAEM; this is not expected when considering the IEC \nand low thickness of this membrane. The area resistance of the S50 AAEM is lower than \nexpected compared to S80 when considering the conductivity data in Figure 2. Recall that \nthe MEAs are not laminated: Variability in contact resistances will be significant. \n \n \n \nFigure 6.  The ir\u2013corrected\u2013Vcell and area resistance (r) versus log10(i) plots of S80 \n(squares), S50 (triangles) and S20 (circles) obtained in H2\/O2 fuel cells at 50 \u00b0C. The test \nconditions were the same as described in the caption of Figure 3. Area resistance data is \nrepresented by the hollow symbols. \n \nInitial H2\/O2 Fuel Cell Tests with Non\u2013PGM cathodes \n \nAs mentioned in the introduction, non\u2013PGMs can be used in AAEM\u2013containing fuel \ncells. Most tests so far have reported to date have used Ag and Au catalysts at the \ncathodes (10, 13, 21\u201324). The electrokinetcis of the oxygen reduction reaction on a Ag \nnanocatalyst has been shown to be enhanced at the Ag|AAEM(s) interface compared to \nthe Ag|NaOH(aq) interface with voltammetry experiments indicating different \nmechanisms were operating (25). MnO2 is well known to be active towards oxygen \nreduction in alkali (26) and has also been evaluated in a AAEM\u2013based fuel cell (27). \nThere is even a report on the use of a carbon\u2013supported La1\u2013xSrxMnO3 perovskite cathode \ncatalyst (28). \n \n \n \nFigure 7.  The performances of Pt\/C (squares), Au\/C (triangles) and Ag\/C (circles) \ncathodes obtained in H2\/O2 fuel cells at 50 \u00b0C with S80 and carbon cloth based \nprefabricated E-Tek Pt\/C(20%mass) 0.5 mgPt cmgeo\u20132 loaded anodes. All cathode \ncatalysts were E-Tek Metal\/VulcanXC\u201372(20%mass) with loadings of 0.5 mgmetal cmgeo\u20132. \nThe fuel cell test conditions were the same as described in the caption of Figure 3. All \nelectrodes were treated with SION1 alkaline ionomer. \n \nPt\/C, Au\/C and Ag\/C cathode catalysts (all 20%mass using Vulcan XC\u201372 carbon \nsupports and with 0.5 mgmetal cmgeo\u20132 loadings) have been compared in equivalent H2\/O2 \nfuel cells at 50 \u00b0C (same test conditions) and with Pt\/C\u2013based carbon cloth anodes \n(Figure 7 and Table II). The particle sizes of the metal particles are 3.11 \u00b1 0.83 (n = 120), \n4 \u2013 100 nm (multidisperse and in vein form), and 30 \u2013 60 nm (multidisperse) respectively \n(TEM). As expected, the Pt\/XC\u201372 catalyst outperformed the non\u2013Pt catalysts with peak \npower densities decreasing in the order Pt > Au > Ag. The internal ohmic resistances, \nelectrokinetics and mass\u2013transport losses all contributed to the above power density \nseries (Figure 8). The above seemingly contradicts a previous study where peak power \ndensities decreased in the order Pt \u2248 Ag > Au (13); however, the Ag\/C and Au\/C \ncathodes used in this previous study contained metal\/XC\u201372(60%mass) with loadings of \n4 mgAg\/Au cmgeo\u20132 loadings compared to the Pt\/C(20%mass)\u2013containing cathode with a \n0.5 mgPt cm\u20132 loading (the Pt Au and Ag particle sizes in this previous study were in the \nranges 2 \u2013 5 nm, 13 \u2013 280 nm, and 200 \u2013 2400 nm respectively). The need for future \nspecific optimization of the catalyst powders for use in AAEM\u2013based fuel cells is clear. \n \nTable II also shows selected data from the H2\/O2 fuel cell tests with cathode \ncontaining Pt\/C catalysts from two different suppliers and with two slightly different \ncarbon supports (Vulcan XC72 and Vulcan XC\u201372R). HISPEC3000 (Johnson Matthey, \nUK \u2013 containing Pt\/VulcanXC\u201372R(20%mass)) with the Pt nanoparticles of particle sizes \nin the range 2 \u2013 3 nm is a standard benchmark catalyst, which we have found to perform \nhighly consistently in our fuel cell systems; previous studies using Solvay\u2019s ADP AAEM \nwith this catalyst show it to perform very well (16). It is immediately obvious that these \nPt catalysts perform differently. More experiments are required to fully understand the \nsource of these differences; the development of an alkaline ionomer, which allows for \nmore consistent lamination of the MEA, is essential for acceptable comparisons. Note: \nthe pseudo\u2013Tafel slopes, b, should not be considered anything more than indicative; the \nfirst 4 low current density points only were used for the linear regression and no mass\u2013\ntransport corrections were applied. The in situ area resistances (EIS) for Pt\/XC\u201372R (JM), \nPt\/XC\u201372R (E\u2013Tek) and Pt\/XC\u201372 (E\u2013Tek) were recorded to be in the ranges 1.1 \u2013 1.4, \n1.4 \u2013 1.5, 1.2 \u2013 1.5 \u2126 cmgeo2 respectively over the current densities tested: Changes in the \nonset of mass transport derived voltage losses were principally responsible for the \ndifferences in performances of these Pt\u2013based catalysts (data not shown). \n \n \n \nFigure 8.

The test conditions were the same as described in the caption of \nFigure 7.  \n \nTABLE II.

The \npreheated aqueous feeds (2 mol dm\u20133 alcohol) were supplied at 10 cm3 min\u20131 to the \nSION1 treated unsupported PtRu (4 mgmetal cmgeo\u20132) containing E-Tek prefabricated \ncarbon cloth anodes. These were used in conjunction with Pt black (4 mgPt cmgeo\u20132) E-\nTek prefabricated SION1 treated carbon cloth cathodes. The relevant cell reactions with \nmethanol are shown in Equations 5 and 6 below. The complete oxidation of a methanol, \nethanol or ethylene glycol molecule to CO2 yields 6, 12, and 10 electrons respectively. \n \nAnode: CH3OH + 6OH\u2013 \u2192 CO2 + 5H2O  + 6e\u2013  Eo = + 0.81 V vs. SHE(298.15 K) [5] \nCathode: 3\/2O2 + 3H2O + 6e\u2013 \u2192 6OH\u2013   Eo = + 0.40 V vs. SHE(298.15 K) [6] \n \nPeak power densities of 2.2 and 2,8 mW cmgeo\u20132 were obtained with methanol for S80 \nand S50 respectively, even though the VOCV decreased from 0.57 to 0.48 V with \nincreasing methanol crossover. The highest power density that could be obtained was 8.5 \nmW cmgeo\u20132 when testing an early prototype S50 AAEM at 80 \u00b0C and with additional \nreactant pressurization (29); note SION1 ionomer was unstable over long periods of time \nat this temperature. Peak power densities of 2.1 and 2.0 mW cmgeo\u20132 were obtained with \nethanol and ethylene glycol respectively when using S80 (15). This class of AAEM \nexhibit low ex situ alcohol permeabilities, though this is likely to be due to the radiation\u2013\ngrafting nature of the membranes rather than being due specifically to the anion\u2013\nexchange chemistry (15, 30); however, alcohol crossover should not be problematic with \na properly engineered fuel cell where the alcohol concentration in the catalyst layer of the \nanode is designed to drop to nearly zero on electrooxidation. For comparison, Bunazawa \nand Yamazaki obtained power densities of nearly 8 mW cmgeo\u20132 at 80 \u00b0C with non\u2013\nalkaline methanol (aq, 1 mol dm\u20133) and no reported back pressurization using \nTokuyama\u2019s A006 AAEM and A3 alkaline ionomer combination (10). \n \nMany other groups are investigating alcohol oxidation catalysts and fuel tolerant \noxygen reduction catalysts for direct alcohol alkaline membrane fuel cells (eg. 5\u20137,21\u2013\n24). Pd based anode catalysts appear promising for alcohol oxidation (31). Ethylene \nglycol is especially active towards electrooxidation in alkaline environments (21,22,32); \nethylene glycol contains a C\u2013C bond but, unlike with ethanol, the C\/O ratio = 1 with each \ncarbon atom bound to an oxygen atom. Most of these prior studies involved the addition \nof metal hydroxide to the alcohol fuel supply. Petrucco et al. (Johnson Matthey \nTechnology Centre) have evaluated S80 in direct methanol fuel cells with additional \nKOH in the methanol supply (33). A peak power density of 50 mW cmgeo\u20132 was obtained \nat 60 \u00b0C with the addition of KOH(aq, 1 mol dm\u20133), which was substantially higher than \nwith alkali\u2013free aqueous methanol fuel. The main contributor to this improved \nperformance is an improved anode potential (300 mV reduction in anode overpotential). \nMore investigations are required to probe the origins of this improvement. It could be due \nto: (a) reduced pH at the anode (compared to the cathode) resulting from carbonate \nformation in the active layers on reaction of the CO2 product of methanol oxidation with \nthe OH\u2013 anions generated at the cathode, yielding a negative pH gradient from the \ncathode to the anode (34); and\/or (b) inadequate supply of OH\u2013 anions to the methanol \noxidation sites (see Equation 5: 6 \u00d7 OH\u2013 anions are required converge on a single \ncatalytic site to oxidize 1 \u00d7 CH3OH molecule \u2013 this is quite a challenge!) (22). \nThe Need for a New Alkaline Ionomer \n \n \n \nFigure 9.  The EDX spectrum of an E\u2013Tek carbon cloth Pt\/C(20%mass) electrode with a \nloading of 0.5 mgPt cmgeo\u20132 that was coated (on the catalyst layer) with 0.5 mg cmgeo\u20132 \npoly(vinylbenzyl chloride) and immersed in N,N,N',N'\u2013tetramethyhexane\u20131,6\u2013diamine \nfor 24 h, followed by ion\u2013exchange to the OH\u2013 form. \n \nThe tests above show that SION1 allows for effective testing of different AAEMs and \ncatalysts in alkaline membrane containing fuel cells, which was the primary objective \nwhen it was being developed. However, as alluded to earlier, this alkaline ionomer \nconcept is non\u2013ideal is several respects: (a) It required the poly(vinylbenzyl chloride) to \nbe deposited using an organic solvent onto highly flammable catalytic powders, which \nwould present an unacceptable hazard on scale-up; (b) The application of SION1 \ninhibited satisfactory MEA lamination; (c) The poly(VBC) treated electrodes have to be \nsubmerged in toxic N,N,N',N'\u2013tetramethyhexane\u20131,6\u2013diamine, which would create a \nlarge volume of chemical waste; (d) The ionomer contains \u03b2\u2013hydrogen atoms therefore \nallowing the Hofmann elimination degradation mechanism to operate and limiting the \nthermal stability to below 60 \u00b0C; (e) Analysis of the SION1 treated electrodes indicate \nthat not all of the benzyl chloride groups of the poly(VBC) polymer react with the \ndiamine (see Figure 9); and (f) The poly(VBC) soaks through to the gas diffusion layer of \nthe carbon cloth electrodes (see Figure 10) resulting in non\u2013ideal gas\/water diffusion \ncharacteristics (this is less of a problem with the carbon paper electrodes). \n \nTo address the issues raised above, Surrey is developing the next\u2013generation of \nalkaline ionomer specifically for use in alkaline membrane fuel cells up to temperatures \nof 80 \u00b0C (SION2). This ionomer: (a) is deposited onto electrode from aqueous solutions \nreducing the fire hazard; (b) the ionomer is deposited in an anionic form and so does not \nrequire a quaternisation step and therefore immersion of the elecrtode in toxic substances; \nand (c) contains no \u03b2\u2013hydrogen atoms for improved thermochemical stability. Details on \nthis alkaline ionomer will be published in due course after IP protection is completed. \n \n \n \nFigure 10.  Scanning Electron Micrographs of the gas diffusion layer of an E\u2013Tek Type\u2013\nA carbon cloth electrode with before (left) and after (right) poly(vinylbenzyl chloride) \nand N,N,N',N'\u2013tetramethyhexane\u20131,6\u2013diamine (SION1) treatment. \n \n \nConcluding Remarks \n \nThe materials developments discussed in this paper demonstrate that there are no \nfundamental barriers to the application of alkaline anion\u2013exchange membranes (AAEM) \nin low temperature fuel cells, contrary to prevailing wisdom as recently as 5 year ago. \nBenzyltrimethylammonium containing AAEMs have thermochemical stabilities up to \n80 \u00b0C and conductivities above 0.06 S cm-1 at 60 \u00b0C are achievable (when fully hydrated). \nRecent progress at Surrey is highlighted by the following chronological advancements in \npeak power densities in metal\u2013cation\u2013free alkaline polymer electrolyte fuel cells \ncontaining Pt\/C(20%mass) electrodes, with loadings of 0.5 mgPt cmgeo\u20132, at 50 \u00b0C with \nfully humidified H2\/O2 gas supplies: \n2004\u20132005: < 2 mW cmgeo\u20132 with membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) fabricated \nfrom 153 \u00b5m thick AAEMs and alkaline\u2013ionomer\u2013free carbon cloth electrodes. \n2005\u20132006: 45 \u2013 60 mW cmgeo\u20132 with MEAs containing 153 \u00b5m thick AAEMs and \nalkaline ionomer treated carbon cloth electrodes. \n2006\u20132007: 80 \u2013 95 mW cmgeo\u20132 with MEAs containing 80 \u00b5m thick radiation\u2013\ngrafted AAEMs and alkaline ionomer treated carbon cloth electrodes or with MEAs \ncontaining 153 \u00b5m thick radiation\u2013grafted AAEMs with carbon cloth anodes \ncombined with carbon paper cathodes (both treated with alkaline ionomer). \n2007: 120 \u2013 130 mW cmgeo\u20132 with MEAs containing 80 \u00b5m thick radiation\u2013grafted \nAAEMs and carbon cloth anodes combined with carbon paper cathodes (both treated \nwith alkaline ionomer). \n2008: 150 and 230 mW cmgeo\u20132 with MEAs containing 48 and 18 \u00b5m thick radiation\u2013\ngrafted AAEMs respectively and alkaline ionomer treated carbon paper electrodes. \nTypical peak power performances in alkaline membrane direct alcohol fuel cells at 50 \u2013 \n80 \u00b0C (methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol) are in the range 2 \u2013 10 mW cmgeo\u20132 with \nthe absence of metal hydroxide additive in the aqueous fuel feed increasing to > 50 mW \ncmgeo\u20132 with the addition of metal hydroxide to the fuel. Future progress is anticipated in \nthe short\u2013term with the development of the next generation alkaline ionomers and \nAAEM\u2013based MEAs. A wider range of fuels can also be used and literature reports \nsuggest that, as well as H2 and C\u2013OH functional\u2013group\u2013containing organic fuels, \ncarbon\u2013free inorganic fuels such as sodium borohydride, ammonium borane and \nhydrazine are being actively investigated. \n \nAcknowledgments \n \nThis work was supported by the U.K.\u2019s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research \nCouncil (EPSRC Grants GR\/S60709\/01 and EP\/F027524\/1), Technology Strategy Board \n(Grant TP\/6\/LOW\/6\/S\/K4019K) and the University of Surrey\u2019s Doctoral\/Collaborative \nTraining Grant Accounts and Research Support Fund.
