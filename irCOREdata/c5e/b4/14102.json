Rhona Sharpe and\nFrances Bell, will form the new ALT-J editorial team and I wish them the best of luck in devel-\noping the direction of ALT-J in the future. I would also like to thank the rest of outgoing editorial\nteam, the ALT-J editorial board, the reviewers and authors that I have worked with over the last\nsix issues of ALT-J, who each in their way has contributed to furthering our knowledge and\nunderstanding of the relationship between technology and learning.\nBefore I step down as editor it seems appropriate for me to look back on the field of e-learning\nand reflect on the progress and developments that have been made in the time since I took up the\npost of ALT-J editor back in 2001. The last time I undertook such a reflective exercise was in\n2003, when I edited a book that aimed to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Association for\nLearning Technology through a review of the impact of learning technology on tertiary education.\nInterestingly, three of the contributors to that review are authors of papers in this issue (Boyle,\nDeepwell and Oliver). I introduced the review by arguing that the years 1993\u20132003 had not been\nparticularly characterized by revolutionary or dramatic developments and that the future would\nbe characterized by gradual rather than radical change (Seale 2003). It might be interesting,\ntherefore, to consider whether the articles in this issue of ALT-J are reporting radical or dramatic\ndevelopments in e-learning policy, research or practice.\nIn this issue we have four articles. Deepwell and Malik present a case study of learner\nexperiences and explore three emerging aspects of the learning experience: student expectations\nof the technology, lecturers engagement with technology and how technology might support\nprocesses of transition in higher education. San Diego et al. describe the development of a prototype\nfor a pedagogy planning tool that can scaffold the process of learning design for teachers and lectur-\ners. Wong, Shephard and Phillips apply the cathedral and bazaar analogy to the development of\nrepositories, while Wali, Winters and Oliver use activity theory to develop theorized conceptions\nof mobile learning.\nIs there anything radical or new in these papers? In one sense no there isn\u2019t. There have been\nnumerous studies over the years that have reported learner responses and satisfaction regarding\nthe use of learning technologies (see, for example, Slaouti 2001). Readers of ALT-J would also\nbe able to trace the origins of learning design back to articles that discussed instructional systems\nsuch as REAL (Grabinger and Dunlap 1995). The growth of learning object research in the early\npart of this millennium went hand in hand with the development of repositories (see, for example,\nCurrier et al. 2004; Lukusiak et al. 2005) and activity theory has already been used as a tool to\nconceptualize particular aspects of e-learning (see, for example, Waycott 2002).\nSo, what do the articles in this issue offer us which adds something new to our understanding\nof e-learning and perhaps has the potential to significantly progress practice and experience?\nCollectively, I believe these articles contribute to the idea that we need to understand the contexts\nin which learners, teachers and institutions are trying to use e-learning. By seeking to understand\ncontexts we may better understand the relationship between learning and technology. For\nexample, in my own field of accessibility I have argued for a contextualized model of accessibil-\nity that takes into account the stakeholders, the context (drivers and mediators) and how the\n2  Editorial\nrelationship between stakeholders and the context influences the responses that stakeholders\nmake and the practices that develop (Seale 2006).\nFor the students in Deepwell and Maliks\u2019 study context becomes important in that the results\nsuggest that students would like more academic guidance from academic tutors on what and how\nto use technology to learn more independently. The implication is that at key transitional points\nstudents need guidance to be contextualized by a subject expert (course tutor), as opposed to a\nprocess expert (e.g. librarian). San Diego et al. argue that the modelling of pedagogy and learning\ndesign needs to be contextualized for lecturers, where the context could range from learning\noutcomes and activities to modules and programmes. Wong, Shephard and Phillips argue that\ncommunity engagement with repositories needs to be understood within the context of the pre-\nexisiting traditions and values of teaching and learning within an institution and a discipline as\nwell as the teachers\u2019 mindset regarding innovation. Wali, Winters and Oliver argue that future\nstudies of mobile learning need to look at learning activities that take place across contexts (repre-\nsented as both physical and social), placing more emphasis on the relationship between learning\nactivities and social contexts.\nIn each article a different stakeholder is represented: from student to lecturer to a community\nas a whole. The contexts in which these stakeholders operate also vary. For students the context\nis key transitional periods, such as the transition between school and university. For lecturers the\ncontext is the particular level for which learning is being designed, while for users of mobile\nlearning the experience of use has to be understood in multiple virtual and physical contexts. For\ncommunities the development of repositories needs to be understood in the context of histories,\ncultures and traditions. The relationship between stakeholders and these contexts may influence\nthe response that stakeholders make. For example, for the students in Deepwell and Maliks\u2019 study\nthe response is a reliance on lecturing staff.\nIn 2003 Oliver argued: \nTo do justice to our field, we need to balance our fascination with the new and strange (such as mobile\ncomputing) alongside the overly familiar. (Oliver 2003, 159)\nFor me, the overly familiar or taken for granted is the context in which technology is used to\nsupport or enhance learning. What each article in this issue of ALT-J offers us is an important\nreminder of the importance and influence of context. Understanding the relationship between\nlearning and technology is all about understanding context.\nJane K. Seale\nUniversity of Southampton\nReferences\nCurrier, S., J. Barton, R.
