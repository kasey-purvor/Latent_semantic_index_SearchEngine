The former results in very high\nscrap rate of expensive aerospace aluminum alloys, whereas the\nlatter relies on some thousands of fasteners to assemble stiffeners\nto the skin sheet. Therefore, joining aircraft structures by welding\ntechnique is attractive and the subject of current intensive research\nby the aerospace industry and academia.1 Adhesive bonding is an-\nother joining approach and was developed well before the initiative\nof welding aerospace aluminum parts.2 It is an old technique, and\nnot as widely used at present as it once was. The main drive of these\nalternative joining methods is to reduce the manufacturing costs by\neliminating the expensive and time-consuming riveting operations.\nThis paper investigates the damage tolerance and fail safety aspects\nof a welded stringer panel used in aircraft wing design.\nWelded stringer panels are regarded as integral structures that\nmust satisfy the necessary requirements on mechanical performance\nthat is achieved by using the current built-up structures. One of such\nrequirements is the damage tolerance and fail safety capability.3\u22125\nThe damage tolerance approach assumes that there are initial cracks\nexisting in structures caused by manufacture defects or maintenance\nhandling and that the fatigue life of the structure is consumed with\nslow crack growth up to the critical crack length at which failure will\noccur on the application of the design limit load. Safety is ensured by\ninspections at which growing cracks can be detected with 90% reli-\nability and 95% confidence. The fail-safe design philosophy states\nthat aircraft shall be designed so that it has capability to continue in\nservice after the failure of major components or structures. Design\nfeatures, such as multiple load paths and crack stoppers in which\nthe structure is capable of bearing design limit load after the failure\nof one major part, are an integral part of a fail-safe design. Although\nthe two-bay crack criterion is not a regulatory requirement, it is often\nan aim for the wing and fuselage panel design.\nTo design damage-tolerant welded stringer panels, it is necessary\nto review the advantages and limitations of integrally machined\nand built-up stringer panels. Riveted stringers act as crack stoppers\nimproving fail safety considerably.3\u22125 However, fastener holes are\nstress raisers and can cause premature initiation of fatigue cracks.\nOn the other hand, integral panels have far superior fatigue resis-\ntance to that of built-up panels, which partially compensates for the\nabsence of the crack-stopping capabilities that are obtained with\n1613\n1614 ZHANG AND LI\nbuilt-up construction. Recent advances in welding techniques to\njoin aerospace aluminum materials have enabled fabricating integral\nstructures with much reduced manufacturing cost. The friction stir\nwelding and laser-beam welding and two plasma welding processes,\nmetal inert gas and variable-polarity plasma arc (VPPA), have all\nshown excellent fatigue endurance for longitudinal weld joints in\nfuselage and wing stringer panels1,5\u22127; the fatigue crack initiation\nlife of welded joints is significantly superior to that of convention-\nally riveted joints. Using longitudinal welded joints in surface panels\nalso improves visual inspection capability that would be a major as-\nset to welded integral structures. However, there are two potential\nproblems with welded structures from the damage-tolerance view-\npoint. First, welded stringer panels lack any redundant members\nthat are important features to fail-safe design. Second, experiments\nhave indicated a considerable increase in crack growth rates in the\nheat-affected zone (HAZ) as a result of welding-induced residual\nstresses.7\nThere have been significant research efforts directed to the fail-\nsafe design of riveted panels,3\u22125,8\u221212 but only a few published works\non integral panels. Nesterenko investigated the residual strength of\nriveted and integral stringer panels made of D16 alloy (similar to\n2024-T3) with the scenario of skin crack under a broken central\nstringer8 and found that the difference between the two panels was\ninsignificant for a two-bay crack length. Nesterenko9 carried out\ntests on wide skin sheets and obtained R-curves to characterize the\ncapability of material to withstand stable crack growth; for 2024-T3\nalloy the critical crack length predicted by R-curves is significantly\nlonger than that predicted by a fixed fracture toughness value caused\nby the tearing resistance behavior of the alloy. R-curves were then\ndeveloped for the stiffened skin panels.\nIn terms of fatigue crack growth, the majority of work has also\nfocused on the built-up constructions. Collins et al.10 investigated\ntwo typical failure scenarios for cracked wing panels, primary crack\nin skin, and secondary crack in stringer, or vice versa. Good cor-\nrelation was found between fatigue test result and prediction using\nan Airbus in-house analysis procedure, which incorporates param-\neters of stringer stiffness, sheet stiffness, and fastener flexibility.\nResidual strength was calculated by the R-curve technique. Hunt\net al.11 reported an Airbus wing design procedure combining crack\ngrowth and residual strength calculations with rivet and stringer\nstatic strength to ensure accurate and optimal sizing capabilities.\nBased on two damage-tolerance scenarios (same as those in Ref. 10),\na methodology was proposed to optimize the key design parame-\nters, that is, skin thickness and stiffener to skin area ratio, under\ncertain constraints such as damage scenario, limit to fatigue stress\nratio, and wing end loads, etc. The method was successfully applied\nto wing design. Less work has been published relating to integral\nwing panels. The early work by Poe on fatigue crack growth of\nbolted and integral stringer panels12 found that the bolted stringers\nreduced the crack growth rate significantly, whereas the integral\nstringers had no significant effect. This conclusion was supported\nby validation fatigue tests. The stiffeners considered were unflanged\n(a very popular design because of their easy machining at low cost).\nThe bay width of 50 mm might not represent the typical pitch for\ncurrent large passenger aircraft wing skin panels, which should be\naround 75\u2013120 mm (Ref. 13). Therefore, the problem should be re-\nvisited with a realistic pitch size and stringer section. According to\nRefs. 13 and 14, optimum integral stringer of compression panels\nshould have Z-section. Recently, Nesterenko8 compared integral and\nriveted panels and found that fatigue crack growth lives in both pan-\nels are practically identical when the initial damage is a skin crack\nbeneath a broken central stringer or a skin crack between adjacent\nstringers provided that the skins of integral and riveted panels are\nfabricated of the same material, D16 alloy in this case. Examining\nhis work we have noticed that the outer stringers for both types of\npanel were allowed to fail after the skin crack passed by the stringer.\nTherefore, the difference between the two panels in both fail-safety\n(two-bay crack) and damage tolerance is marginal. In reality, the\nriveted stringers are likely to survive after a skin crack has passed\nby it, especially if the stringers are made of high strength alloys, for\nexample, the commonly used 7075-T6 alloy.3\u22125\nThere have been research programs devoted to crack growth be-\nhavior under the influence of welding residual stresses and micro-\nstructural changes in the HAZ, but all were performed with simple\nplates.1,6,7,15,16 Although the work in Ref. 8 provides useful infor-\nmation on the difference between riveted and integral panels, crack\ngrowth behavior in the HAZ will be different, and the significance\nof this on damage-tolerance design needs to be investigated.\nThe main objectives of this work are to investigate fatigue crack\ngrowth behavior of welded integral stringer panels and to explore\nfail-safety design options for integral structures. The analysis is per-\nformed using the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and the\nfinite element method (FEM). Two design configurations are em-\nployed: a two-stringer panel for fatigue analysis and validation by\nexperimental tests and a realistic nine-stringer panel for compari-\nson with a riveted panel of the same geometry. Finally, in a novel\ndevelopment the influence of bonded straps to act as crack growth\nretarders is explored using the same analysis techniques.\nStringer Panels Studied in This Paper\nTwo-Stringer Panels\nThese panels are designed for fatigue testing. Restricted by the\ncapacity of fatigue test machine and constraints on weld joint thick-\nness (7 mm), it was only possible to build two-stringer panels. VPPA\nwelding was employed to connect stringers to skin sheet. It is a weld-\ning process that produces the fusion and subsequent joining of the\nwork-piece material by means of a highly constricted variable po-\nlarity arc.17 In this study the stringers and skin panels were made\nof 2024-T351 aluminum alloy and were joined at the stringer-web\nnear to the skin doubler as shown in Fig. 1a. The initial thickness\nof the weld joint was 12.5 mm; after postweld machining the fin-\nished thickness was 7 mm. To save material, the weld joints were\nkept as close to the skin doubler as possible. Subsequent to the opti-\nmization procedure developed in simple plates of the same material,\nfull-length stringer panels were welded by adjustable keyhole mode\noperation. Distortion (bowing) after welding was less than 5 mm\nover a panel span of 1440 mm, and very low levels of weld defects\nand porosity were observed.17 The tensile properties in aluminum\nalloy 2024-T351 (Ref. 7) are given here: Young\u2019s modulus, 72 GPa;\n0.2% yield strength, 371 MPa; ultimate tensile strength, 477 MPa;\nand elongation, 18.4\u201321%.\nTo make comparisons with riveted panels used in the current large\ntransport aircraft, I and J stringers were adopted for the tension and\ncompression panels representing, respectively, the lower and upper\nsurfaces of aircraft wing. Figure 1 shows the two design configura-\ntions with the longitudinal weld joints being placed at the stringer\nweb at 12 mm from the skin-doubler, for this is the minimum oper-\national distance required by the access of welding equipment. The\nstiffener to skin area ratio (Ast\/bt) is defined as the ratio of the\nstiffener cross-section area to the product of the bay width and skin\nthickness; it is 1.03 for the tension panel (Fig. 1b) and 0.87 for\nthe compression panel (Fig. 1c). The skin doublers are considered\nnecessary to ease the welding residual stresses and to reduce the\nstress intensity factor of a skin crack. In this study, the doubler\u2019s\ncross-section area is counted as the stiffener area.\nWelding-induced residual stresses in the two-stringer panels are\nmeasured by a neutron diffraction technique.16 The longitudinal\nresidual stress field is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2; the maxi-\nmum tensile stress is about 150 MPa, and the maximum compressive\nstress is about 75 MPa. This paper focuses on the tension panel for\nwhich damage tolerance is most critical to aircraft design. The upper\nwing surface is designed predominantly by static criteria and to a\nlesser extent by fatigue.11 Finite element (FE) static load analysis\nwas performed for the compression panel that indicates no notice-\nable change in the critical buckling load as a result of the existence\nof welding residual stresses.\nNine-Stringer Tension Panel\nThis is a generic form of multiple-stringer stiffened panel de-\nsigned for numerical studies.

This geometry was used for three cases: riveted, integrally machined, and welded\nintegral panels, for comparison in damage tolerance and fail-safety performance.\nin Fig. 3. These wider panels allow us to study the scenarios of skin\ncrack growth either under a broken stringer or between two adja-\ncent stringers and make comparisons among integrally machined,\nwelded integral and riveted panels. The material used for fabricat-\ning the skin sheets and stringers is aluminum alloy 2024-T351. The\nstiffener to skin area ratio is 0.62 for both configurations.\nDamage-Tolerance Analysis\nFailure Scenarios\nFor this study, we have chosen a two-bay crack length as an arbi-\ntrary critical crack length for residual strength check. It is not a uni-\nversal failure criterion for the design of stiffened wing panels, and it\nis often desirable but still not a regulatory requirement. Three failure\nscenarios have been selected for the damage-tolerance analysis.\nThe first failure scenario is crack propagation from a flaw at the\nweld joint (Fig. 4a), where weld defects and porosity can exist.\nOnce a crack initiates under cyclic loads, it will propagate faster\nunder the influence of tensile residual stresses in the HAZ. The\nstringer will eventually fail, and the crack propagates into the skin\nresulting in the second failure scenario: a two-bay skin crack with\na broken central stringer (Fig. 4b). The same failure mode also\nexists for the riveted panels. According to Swift,5 fatigue crack\ncan initiate in stiffeners in the wing lower surface at fuel transfer\nslots or at rib connection fittings. Because this damage might not be\nimmediately detected, continued cyclic loading will cause extremely\nhigh load transfer at the first fastener causing stringer failure. Then\nthe stringer load will be transferred to the skin creating a skin crack,\nwhich will eventually propagate into two adjacent skin bays. This\n1616 ZHANG AND LI\na)\nb)\nc)\nFig. 4 Failure scenarios: a) stringer failure due to initial flaws in weld join, b) skin crack growth under a broken central stringer, and c) midbay skin\ncracks in integrally machined and riveted panels.\nfailure mode also represents a discrete source damage caused by\nfragments from a failed engine, which spans from one bay to the\nother bay and severs one stringer. The goal of this study is to provide\nthe two-bay damage capability at the design limit load. The third\ndamage scenario is a midbay skin crack growing toward two adjacent\nstringers (Fig. 4c). The riveted stringers are effective crack retarders\ncaused by crack bridging mechanism. In contrast, integral stringers\nare not so effective because of the lack of redundancy structural\nmembers, which is characteristic of attached (either mechanically\nor bonded) stiffeners. On the other hand, an integral panel should\nhave slower crack growth rate around the stringer and skin junction\nas a result of the complete rigid connection.\nAnalysis Methods\nStress intensity factor (SIF) is calculated by the finite element\nmethod employing the MSC NASTRAN package. The SIF range\n\u0002K is then modified by the effects of cyclic plasticity (crack clo-\nsure) and welding residual stresses through the argument of the\neffective stress-intensity-factor range \u0002Keff. One way of doing this\nis to perform elastoplastic FE analysis of crack growth under cyclic\nloads calculating crack opening stress levels and \u0002Keff:\n\u0002Keff = Kmax \u2212 Kopen (1)\nwhere\nKmax = \u03b2\u03c3max\n\u221a\n\u03c0a, Kopen = \u03b2\u03c3open\n\u221a\n\u03c0a (2)\nParameters Kmax, Kopen and \u03c3open are determined by FE analysis\nunder the combined residual and applied stress field.\nIn this work, \u03c3open is assumed to be a function of the R-ratio R and\nthe welding-induced residual stress but not related to the structural\ngeometry; therefore, it is possible that FE analyses for different\nR-ratios and welding parameters are performed on simple welded\nplates, and the calculated crack opening stresses (normalized by\nmaximum cyclic stress) are applied to structures (stringer panels in\nthis case). For a given structure, once the \u03b2 (structural geometry) and\n\u03c3open (cyclic plasticity) are found, fatigue life prediction is carried\nout for a given load spectrum. This method is applied for constant\namplitude loading analysis. Details of the elastoplastic analysis of\nwelded plates and crack closure behavior are given in Ref. 18.\nResidual stress caused by welding has three stress components,\nthat is, longitudinal and transverse to the loading direction and nor-\nmal to the material\u2019s thickness direction. According to the mea-\nsurement in Ref. 16, the transverse and normal stress components\nare significantly lower than the longitudinal stress, especially in the\ntensile field. Our FE simulation of simple center crack tension plates\nshows that the stress intensity factor and crack growth rate are not\nsensitive to the presence of the transverse residual stress component\nin the FE model.18 Therefore, in this study only the longitudinal\nresidual stress component is included into the FE and crack growth\nmodels as an initial stress field.\nAn alternative approach is linear elastic by superposing the re-\nspective SIF\u2019s as a result of applied and welding residual stresses.\nAccording to the fundamental assumptions of LEFM, that is, simil-\nitude and small-scale yielding, superposition should work. The SIF\nrange and stress ratio are calculated as\n\u0002K = (Kmax + Kresidual) \u2212 (Kmin + Kresidual) (3)\nR = (Kmin + Kresidual)\n(Kmax + Kresidual) (4)\nDistribution of residual stress field can be input directly into a crack\ngrowth prediction package called AFGROW,19 which has build-in\nweight function and Gaussian integration facilities that will calculate\nthe residual SIF and superpose it to the applied SIF. From Eqs. (3)\nand (4), the SIF range does not vary with residual stresses, but the\nstress ratio does, which will alter the crack opening stress level.\nAFGROW uses empirical laws (e.g., the NASGROW equation) to\naccount for the crack closure effect. In this study this method is\nemployed for variable amplitude loading spectra.\nFatigue Crack Growth Life\nStringer Web Failure\nFor the two-stringer tension panel, fatigue tests were performed\nwith an initial crack of 6 mm in one stringer at the center of the weld\njoint. This simulates the first failure scenario as shown in Fig. 4a.\nIn the fatigue test, the crack was found to propagate almost simul-\ntaneously toward the stringer upper flange and the skin doubler.\nThis scenario was simulated by moving the two crack tips in both\ndirections simultaneously. The virtual crack closure technique was\nemployed within the framework of FEM to calculate the crack-tip\nstrain energy release rate that was then converted to the SIF. The\nrelationship of dimensionless SIF \u03b2 vs crack length and measured\nlongitudinal residual stresses was then inputted into the AFGROW\ncode19 for crack growth life prediction. Figure 5 shows the predic-\ntion results for the crack tip growing toward the stringer upper flange\nunder a constant amplitude load (Fig. 5a) and a typical service load\nspectrum (Fig. 5b). The Wheeler overload retardation model is used\nin this study. Both panels failed by the net-section-yield criterion.\nZHANG AND LI 1617\nThe stringer web is 59 mm long. The critical half crack length is\n40 mm from the weld joint toward the upper flange root. This is\nconsistent with the measured critical crack length. For both loading\ncases, final crack growth lives obtained from the panel test could\nbe accurately predicted, but the form of the crack length vs cycles\ncurve is quite different from the test result (Fig. 5). Redistribution\nof residual stresses caused by crack growth was observed in test but\nwas not incorporated in the crack growth analysis, and the differ-\nences in predicted and experimental crack growth rates might be\nrelated to this. This problem is currently under study.\nFor the same geometry, the predicted crack growth life for an in-\ntegrally machined stringer is significantly longer than that of welded\nstringer, about twice longer under the same constant amplitude load\nand four times longer under the variable amplitude loading. This\ncomparison indicates that if a crack initiates at the weld joint then\na)\nb)\nFig. 5 Fatigue crack growth life in stringer web of the two-stringer\ntension panel; prediction vs test: a) constant-amplitude loading (\u03c3max =\n88 MPa, R = 0.1); and b) aircraft service load spectrum (\u03c3max =\n138 MPa).\nFig. 6 FE model for 14 of nine-stringer panel using the NASTRAN package and two-dimensional plate elements.\nthe tensile residual stress field in the fusion and heat affect zones\nwill accelerate the crack growth rate significantly until the crack tip\nhas grown well out of the HAZ.\nSkin Crack Growth Under a Broken Stringer\nThis analysis employs the nine-stringer panel aiming at making\ncomparisons with a riveted panel of the same geometry. Figure 3\nshows the two configurations, riveted and integrally machined; the\nlatter can be modified to a welded integral panel by adding welding\nresidual stresses in the analysis model. Because of the geometric\nsymmetry, only a quarter panel is modeled as shown in Fig. 6. An\nassumption is made here based on the work in Ref. [12], that is, when\na skin crack passes an integral stringer the crack will turn 90 deg and\npropagate along the stringer at the same growth rate as the skin crack\n(see insert of Fig. 6). This assumption can provide a conservative\nprediction for crack growth life. In reality, the crack growth rate\nalong the length of the stringer might be slower than the passing skin\ncrack; this will depend on the panel deflection, skin crack length, and\nthe stiffener to skin area ratio. Even when the stringer crack growth\nslows down or is temporarily arrested, integrally machined stringers\ncannot act as crack growth retarders; hence, the structure is not fail\nsafe. It is also assumed that the riveted stringers will be intact when\na skin crack passes by; hence, the stringer will take considerable\namount of loads from the cracked skin reducing the crack tip SIF\nsignificantly. These assumptions are realistic,12 but one must ensure\nthat the stress in the outer stringer does not exceed the yield strength\nof the stringer material.3\u22125\nFigure 7 shows the variations of the dimensionless SIF \u03b2 with\ncrack length for the integral and riveted panels (FEM), and the the-\noretical solution of an unstiffened panel of the same width. For the\nriveted panel the FE result presented in Fig. 7 was validated by the\ndisplacement compatibility approach3,5 with a few modifications\nmade in this paper on the bending effect of the broken stringers,\nthe finite-width correction, and approximations in dealing with the\ndouble-line riveted stringers20; the numerical solution of SIF agrees\nvery well with the analytical solution. Figure 7 shows that for the\nunstiffened panel \u03b2 increases with the growing crack length, as one\nwould expect. For both forms of stringer panel, initially the \u03b2 values\nare much higher than that of unstiffened panel because of the broken\nstringer transferring stress back to the skin. \u03b2 values decrease when\nskin crack approaches the first outer stringer, and \u03b2 of the integral\npanel is significantly lower (hence slower crack growth rate) than\nthat of the riveted panel as a result of the complete rigid connection\nof stringer to skin. However, \u03b2 of the integral panel soon increases\nvery rapidly after the crack has passed the first outer stringer because\nof the crack growth along the stringer (see insert of Fig. 6). Once\nthe crack has grown through the stringer web section, the failure of\nthe upper flange is modeled by a sudden fracture failure; this causes\nan instant increase in \u03b2 as indicated in Fig. 7 because part of the\nstringer stress is transferred to the skin. In contrast with the inte-\ngral panel, \u03b2 of the riveted panel decreases as the skin crack grows\n1618 ZHANG AND LI\nFig. 7 Dimensionless stress intensity factor \u03b2 of riveted, integrally machined and unstiffened panels.\nbecause of the intact outer stringers that pick up more loads from the\ncracked skin. In our FE simulation of the riveted panel, the variation\nof the stringer stresses in the outer stringers is recorded as the skin\ncrack propagates. For example, for a two-bay crack length (a = 140\nmm) under the applied stress of 80 MPa (constant amplitude load\ncase), the maximum von Mises stress in the first outer stringer is 211\nMPa; for applied stress of 138 MPa (maximum variable amplitude\nstress), the maximum von Mises stress in the first outer stringer is\n365 MPa, which is just under the yield stress of the material, but the\nmaximum stress is confined in a very small region. Beyond the two-\nbay crack length, stringer stress increases rapidly. For example, for\na = 155 mm under the applied stress of 138 MPa, the maximum von\nMises stress in the first outer stringer is 410 MPa, which is higher\nthan the yield strength. In this paper, stringer failure caused by yield-\ning is not modeled, hence, the continued decrease in \u03b2 even for six-\nbay crack length. This provides unconservative prediction of crack\ngrowth. In fact, \u03b2 will increase after the first outer stringer fails. To\nsimulate the welded integral panel, the residual stresses in the skin\ndoublers and stringer web are inputted in the locations according to\nthe measurement, and the corresponding residual SIF are calculated.\nThe initial crack length under the central broken stringer is\n2a = 50 mm. This is based on visual inspection with good detection\nreliability.9 Constant-amplitude load (CAL) and variable-amplitude\nload representing a typical transport aircraft spectrum are applied\nfor the computer simulation using the AFGROW code. The plane-\nstress fracture toughness values employed in the AFGROW (e.g.,\nKC = 74 MPa\u221am for 2024-T351) are far too low for this wide panel.\nThese KC values come from narrow panels that are net-section yield\ncritical. For the wide nine-stringer panels we have used KC = 137\nMPa\n\u221a\nm, which comes from wide panel test reported in Refs. 5 and\n21. In the work of Ref. 8, a higher KC value (160\u2013198 MPa\n\u221a\nm)\nwas reported for a similar alloy and same thickness.\nConstant amplitude loading. Figure 8a shows the predicted\ncrack growth lives for riveted, integrally machined, and welded\npanels under constant amplitude loading. First, the difference in\nlife between the riveted and integrally machined panels is signifi-\ncant, 14,700 vs 7860 cycles. This is mainly because of the variations\nin \u03b2 (Fig. 7). Initially the \u03b2 of integral panel is higher than that of\nriveted panel until the half crack length a reaches 70 mm; hence,\nthe crack in integral panel propagates faster. From a = 100 mm the\n\u03b2 value of integral panel is significantly lower than that of riveted\npanel (because of the rigid connection of the integral skin doubler\nFig. 8a Predicted crack growth lives for the nine-stringer panels: riv-\neted, integrally machined, and welded integral. Constant-amplitude\nloading, \u03c3max = 80 MPa, R = 0.1.\nFig. 8b Schematic of longitudinal residual stress distribution in skin-\ndoublers. This stress field has been used for calculating the stress inten-\nsity factor caused by residual stresses.\nto stringer compared to the more compliant rivet assembly), hence\nthe much reduced crack growth rates until the crack tip is just be-\nyond the first outer stringer (a = 150 mm). From then on, the riveted\npanel has much slower crack growth rate because of the intact outer\nstringers (hence much lower \u03b2 values), whereas the integral panel\nsuffers much faster crack growth rate until the final failure caused\nby fracture of the first outer stringer. Second, the welded integral\npanel has significantly longer life than that of the plain integral\npanel, 10,640 vs 7860 cycles. The compressive residual stresses in\nthe skin doublers result in much reduced effective stress intensity\nfactors for the half crack length range a = 50\u2013110 mm (Fig. 8b).\nThis phenomenon is confirmed by an experimental test for the two-\nstringer welded panel with an initial midbay crack of 6 mm growing\ntoward two adjacent stringers. It is found that the crack growth rate\nZHANG AND LI 1619\nof the midbay crack is noticeably slower than that of a parent metal\nsample under the same \u0002K . The residual stress fields in this case are\nsome distance away from the skin crack and have initially negative\nvalues in the adjacent skindoublers. The influence of these com-\npressive residual stresses was integrated into the residual SIF and\nadded to the applied SIF forming an effective SIF that was used to\ncalculate the crack growth rates. In summary, before the crack tip\nreaching the first outer stringer fatigue crack growth, lives of inte-\ngrally machined and welded panels are comparable with that of the\nriveted panel. However, once the crack is beyond two-bay length\nboth forms of integral panels (machined or welded) suffer much\nfaster crack growth rate compared to the riveted variant. The riv-\neted panel has the longest critical crack length and crack growth life\nand eventually fail by the net-section yield criterion, whereas both\nintegral panels have very high SIF when the crack is just beyond\ntwo-bay length and are broken by the fracture criterion. Stringer\nfailure caused by yielding is not considered in this paper, which\nwill reduce the crack growth life of the riveted panel.\nVariable amplitude load. Figure 9 shows the predicted crack\ngrowth lives for riveted, integrally machined, and welded panels\nunder the same variable amplitude loading as for the two-stringer\npanel presented in Fig. 5b. The riveted panel has fatigue life of 7154\nflights with a critical half crack length of 415 mm, while the integral\npanel failed at 5790 flights at half crack length of 330 mm. For the\nlatter the practical critical half crack length is about 150 mm, which\nis just over two-bay length. The considerably shorter critical crack\nlength for the integral panel is caused by the much higher stress\nintensity factor after the failure of two consecutive outer stringers.\nAs shown in Fig. 7, when the crack tip has passed the second outer\nstringer, a = 310 mm, the \u03b2 value reaches 1.8 resulting in very\nhigh SIF and faster crack growth rate leading to fast fracture. The\nsimulation indicates that the riveted panel fails by the net-section\nyield criterion while the integral panel is broken by the fracture\ncriterion. The welded integral panel has longest crack growth life\nfor the same reason as discussed for the CAL load case. However, the\nwelded panel is not regarded as a fail-safe design because the crack\nreaches its critical length at the first outer stringer with no attached\nstructural members as a safe guard against any sudden catastrophic\nfailure, whereas the riveted panel can tolerate a four-bay crack. This\nresult was based on the assumption that crack will also propagate\nalong an integral stringer when a skin crack passes by, while a riveted\nstringer will remain intact. This results in conservative estimations\nof the critical crack length and crack growth life in the integral panels\nand nonconservative estimation for the riveted panel. More accurate\nprediction could be achieved by calculating the crack growth rates\nof the skin and stringer cracks separately and taking account of the\nstringer failure as a result of yielding.\nThe crack growth pattern is complicated by the load sequence\neffect. The Wheeler overload retardation model is used, and the\ncomputer simulation shows a strong overload retardation effect for\nthis type of load spectrum; without accounting for this effect, crack\nFig. 9 Predicted crack growth lives for the nine-stringer panels\n(riveted, integral and welded). Variable-amplitude loading, \u03c3max =\n138 MPa.\ngrowth lives would be significantly underestimated. The overload\neffect and the use of Wheeler model are validated by the test of the\ntwo-stringer panels.\nResidual Strength Analysis\nFor the plane-strain condition fracture toughness KC is a mate-\nrial constant. However, for the plane-stress or transitional conditions\nKC depends on panel\u2019s thickness as well as the width.21,22 There-\nfore only the R-curve approach can accurately define the residual\nstrength for the thickness studied here. Because of the lack of R-\ncurve data for this very wide panel, residual strength is calculated\nbased on the static failure criterion of linear elastic fracture mechan-\nics, that is, Kmax = KC . The critical value used is KC = 137 MPa\u221am\naccording to Ref. 5 for the same material, similar skin thickness, and\nstringer to skin area ratio.\nFor 2024-T351, it is reasonable to choose the value of 240 MPa\nas a typical stress level corresponding to the design limit load.5 In\nreality the limit stress can be quite variable across the whole wing\nstructure. The calculated skin fracture curves for both riveted and\nintegral panels are shown in Fig. 10. Because of the complete rigid\nconnection, the integrally machined panel offers higher residual\nstrength (275 MPa) than that of riveted panel (230 MPa) at the two-\nbay crack length (a\/b = 1), but before the skin crack reaches two-\nbay length the difference in residual strength between the two panels\nis not significant. However, when the skin crack is beyond the two-\nbay boundary, the riveted panel is performing significantly better\nthan that of integral panel. The residual strength of riveted panel is\nkept just below 240 MPa for a long crack of six-bay length, while the\nresidual strength of integral panel is dropped to a very low level. The\nanalysis of the riveted panel did not include stringer failure caused\nby yielding. With the skin crack growth beyond two-bay length, the\nfirst outer stringer will break as a result of load transfer from skin to\nstiffeners. Therefore, both the skin fracture curve and stringer yield\nfailure should be considered to provide accurate prediction.3\u22125\nWelding residual stress was not taken into account in the residual\nstrength analysis. It is expected that the compressive residual stresses\n(Fig. 8b) at the skin doublers will raise the residual strength; this is\nbased on the skin fracture curve resulting from the \u03b2 variation with\nthe residual stresses. However, the tensile residual stresses in the\nwelded stringers will accelerate the stringer crack growth rate. Both\nthe positive and negative effects should be accounted in the future\nstudies.\nFail-Safe Design Using Bonded Straps\nFigures 8 and 9 indicate that both forms of integral panel have\nmuch shorter critical crack length, that is, acr = 150 mm (two-bay\ncrack length), compared to acr = 420 mm (six-bay length) for the\nriveted panel. Although the residual strength at two-bay crack length\nis comparable for the riveted and integral panels, the latter is not\nregarded as fail-safe design because of the absence of redundant\nstructural members; sudden failure will occur when the skin crack is\nbeyond two-bay length. Therefore some forms of attached members\nare necessary to ensure fail safety.\nIn this work we have chosen adhesively bonded straps as crack\ngrowth retarders. These narrow straps are 3 mm thick and 15 mm\nwide and are placed 6 mm away from the doubler edge (Fig. 11a).\nTwo materials are selected for the straps, titanium alloy Ti-6Al-\n4V and carbon\/epoxy 6376C-HTA unidirectional (UD) laminates\n(24 plies). The former is highly ductile and hence will cope with\nlarger crack opening displacement while the straps picking up loads\nfrom the cracked skin slowly and effectively; the latter is brittle\nbut has very high tensile strength (almost double the titanium alloy\nstrength), and so it can take much higher loads and is about 60%\nlighter. The bonding layer is made of FM 73 adhesive material. A\ntypical experimental shear stress-strain relation of the adhesive gives\nshear strength of 37 MPa and shows large nonlinear deformation\nbefore failure by shear.2\nIn our FE model, the corresponding nodes on the overlapping\nstrap and skin are connected by three spring elements (per connec-\ntion point) to simulate the deformation of adhesive layer, two springs\nrepresenting the shear deformation in two lateral directions and one\n1620 ZHANG AND LI\nFig. 10 Skin fracture curves for both integral and riveted panels.\nFig. 11a Schematic of strap design considerations: geometry and material.\nFig. 11b Effect of bonded straps on crack-opening displacements.\nZHANG AND LI 1621\nmimicking the peeling action. The Young\u2019s modulus of the adhe-\nsive is Ea = 1.92 GPa, and the strength values are \u03c4u = 33.0 MPa\n(pure shear) and \u03c3u = 57.0 MPa (von Mises equivalent value). The\nbehavior of the adhesive is assumed to be elastic for simplicity in\nanalysis. The stiffness of the spring elements is determined based\non the method in Ref. 23.\nAt each computational iteration step, the adhesive stresses are\ncalculated by\n\u03c4x,i = fx,i\/Ael, \u03c4y,i = fy,i\/Ael (5)\n\u03c4i =\n\u221a\n\u03c4 2x,i + \u03c4 2y,i , \u03c3i = fz,i\/Ael (6)\nAssuming local adhesive failure (disbond between skin and strap)\noccurs when\n\u03c3e =\n\u221a\n\u03c3 2i + 3\u03c4 2i \u2265 \u03c3u for \u03c3i > 0 (7)\nor\n\u03c3e =\n\u221a\n3\u03c4i \u2265 \u03c3u for \u03c3i \u2264 0 (8)\nThe debonding process is modeled in an iterative manner. When\nEq. (7) or (8) is satisfied, the stiffness values of the relevant spring\nelements are set to zero. This is done for a small group of springs\nat a time to ensure computational convergence. Computed crack-\nopening displacement profiles are shown in Fig. 11b, demonstrating\nFig. 12 Maximum in-plane stress in the first bonded strap that the\ncrack tip has passed: von Mises stress for the titanium strap; fiber di-\nrection tensile stress for the composite strap.\nFig. 13 Effect of bonded straps on the stress intensity factor of a two-bay crack.\nthe effectiveness of the bonded straps in restricting the crack open-\ning deformation, which is related to the effective SIF values. The\neffectiveness of these bonded straps depends on the amount of load\nthat gets transferred from skin to straps with crack growth. As the\ncrack length increases, the shear and peel stresses in the adhesive\nlayer will also increase and eventually exceed the allowable values\nresulting in local disbond between the strap and panel skin. With\nlocalized disbond the straps can still carry the load but are less ef-\nfective because of the lack of shear transfer capability. Figure 11b\nalso shows the case when debonding is not modeled in the computer\nsimulation, which is not realistic for this material, but if we use a\nbetter adhesive disbond will be delayed or avoided. Figure 12 shows\nthe stress levels in the first bonded strap that the crack has passed\nand comparison with the case when disbond is not modeled; for the\nlatter case, the tensile stress in the strap is very high reaching the\nultimate tensile strength of both strap materials at two-bay crack\nlength. For the titanium strap, the maximum stress results in gross\nyield of the strap. For the composite strap, the in-plane tensile stress\nis close to the ultimate tensile strength. The figure also shows con-\nsiderable reduction in strap stress as soon as the adhesive starts to\ndebond. The figure also indicates that the strap failure stress is never\nreached because of adhesive disbond; hence, the strap becomes less\nefficient in transferring the skin load. The composite strap is more\neffective than the titanium one in terms of reducing in-plane tensile\nloads. The variation of \u03b2 vs crack length (Fig. 13) shows that us-\ning bonded straps can reduce the crack-tip stress intensity factor by\nabout 25%. Consequently crack growth rate will be reduced even\nmore significantly. The difference in \u03b2 values is small by straps\nmade of two different materials. Figure 14 presents the predicted\ncrack growth life of an integrally machined panel reinforced with\nbonded straps made of unidirectional carbon\/epoxy (geometry; see\nFig. 11). In this case the AFGROW computation was terminated at\nthe half crack length of 200 mm because the \u03b2 calculation was cut\nshort at this crack length because of the time-consuming computa-\ntion, that is, elastoplastic analysis and adhesive disbond modeling.\nNevertheless 200 mm is about the critical crack length when fast\nfracture will occur, and this example is sufficient to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the bonded straps; the improved crack growth\nlife of 20,467 flights is significant: five times of the plain integral\npanel. This example is a feasibility study to explore the crack bridg-\ning capability of bonded straps; hence, estimated dimensions and\npositions for these straps have been used. The manufacture cost of\nintegral panels (by machining, extrusion, or welding) and adhesive\nbonding of discrete thin straps should be further investigated against\nthe cost of riveted panels given that automatic riveting machines are\nnow widely used. The material and geometry of these crack growth\nretarders should be optimized, and their impact on the overall load\ntransfer and stiffness of the wing structure should also be studied.\n1622 ZHANG AND LI\nFig. 14 Predicted crack growth lives for integrally machined panels with and without crack retarder straps; aircraft service load spectrum (\u03c3max =\n138 MPa).\nConclusions\nThis paper has investigated the damage-tolerance and fail-safety\nissues of welded stringer panels used in aircraft wing design. The\neffect of welding residual stress on crack growth life has been taken\ninto account in the fracture mechanics and finite element analyses.\nComparison of the fatigue crack growth behavior has been made\nwith riveted and integrally machined panels of the same geometry.\nThe study is carried out by numerical simulation of a welded two-\nstringer panel and a wide nine-stringer panel; analysis of the former\nis validated by experimental test. The following conclusions are\ndrawn:\nFor cracks initiated at the weld joint, tensile residual stresses in\nthe fusion and heat-affected zones will accelerate the crack growth\nrate significantly resulting in shorter crack growth life than that\nof integrally machined stringer panel. For the two-stringer panel\nunder a typical transport aircraft load spectrum, it takes about 16,000\nflights for one stringer to fail due to a 6-mm initial crack at the weld\njoint.\nSimulation of the relative performance of riveted, integrally\nmachined, and welded nine-stringer panels indicates that 1) inte-\ngral stringers (by either welding or machining) are more effective\nthan riveted stringers in reducing the stress intensity factors at the\nstringer-skin connection area as a result of the former being much\nmore rigid than the latter, consequently when a skin crack is ap-\nproaching the first outer stringer crack growth rate becomes slower\nin the integral panels compared to the riveted panel; 2) welded in-\ntegral panel has the longest fatigue crack growth life, but the worst\nfail safety behavior with unstable crack after the failure of two outer\nstringers; and 3) the much reduced crack growth rate in welded\npanel is also caused by the influence of welding-induced compres-\nsive residual stresses at the adjacent skin doublers. Therefore, if a\ncrack initiates outside the HAZ and propagates between two welded\nstringers, then the crack growth rate is reduced.\nAdhesively bonded straps are necessary and effective in increas-\ning the residual strength and crack growth life of integrally machined\nand welded integral panels. In this paper a titanium alloy and a fiber-\nreinforced plastic are selected for making these straps representing\na wide range of material behavior; numerical simulation suggests\nthat straps made of unidirectional carbon\/epoxy composite are more\neffective in transferring loads from a cracked skin panel.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are grateful to the Engineering and Physical Sciences\nResearch Council (GR\/N14057), QinetiQ, and Airbus UK for pro-\nviding financial assistance.
