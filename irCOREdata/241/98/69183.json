Introduction\n[2] Geosynchronous orbit, typically located near the inner\nedge of the plasma sheet, is an ideal location from which to\nstudy and monitor the access and delivery of plasma sheet\nmaterial from the magnetotail into the inner magnetosphere.\nThe plasma sheet is the source of the high-energy plasma\ninjected into the inner magnetosphere during magnetic\nstorms and substorms. Plasma sheet material delivered to\nthe inner magnetosphere by strong magnetospheric convec-\ntion is a major source of the enhanced ring current present\nduring storm times. Determination of the properties of\nplasma sheet material, its spatial and temporal access, and\nits variation with solar cycle, convection, and the strength of\nthe ring current itself, is crucial to an understanding of how\nthe ring current forms and evolves during storm periods. In\naddition, bulk plasma parameters are often used as bound-\nary conditions in global ring current models [e.g., Wolf et\nal., 1982; Chen et al., 1994; Fok et al., 1996; Jordanova et\nal., 1997], and thus calculation of these properties for a\nwide range of conditions has the potential to assist in\ntheoretical simulations of the inner magnetospheric region.\n[3] Borovsky et al. [1998] described how plasma may be\ntransported from the distant tail to geosynchronous orbit.\nPrevious investigations by Korth et al. [1999] have shown\nthat plasma sheet access to geosynchronous orbit is statis-\ntically well correlated with the Kp index [Bartels et al.,\n1939], a proxy for the convection electric field strength [see\nalso Thomsen, 2004]. Moreover, Korth et al. [1999] showed\nthat the density of plasma sheet ions at geosynchronous\norbit is maximised during periods of high Kp and that the\naccess of protons and electrons to geosynchronous orbit is\ncrucial to explaining the variation of their bulk density and\ntemperature, since the average plasma sheet access to\ngeosynchronous orbit varies with local time, Kp, particle\nspecies, and energy. A theoretical prediction of the access of\nplasma to geosynchronous orbit was further investigated by\nKorth and Thomsen [2001].\n[4] Friedel et al. [2001] used Polar-HYDRA data to\nconfirm that the spatial distribution of plasma sheet elec-\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 110, A07223, doi:10.1029\/2004JA010861, 2005\n1Space Sciences and Applications, Los Alamos National Laboratory,\nLos Alamos, New Mexico, USA.\n2Space Physics Group, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics\nLaboratory, Laurel, Maryland, USA.\n3Marine Physics Laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography,\nUniversity of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.\n4Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Space Sciences Department, University of\nMichigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.\nCopyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/05\/2004JA010861$09.00\nA07223 1 of 17\ntrons is statistically very well organized with respect to\ntheoretical Alfve\u00b4n boundaries, but plasma sheet protons are\nless well organized. This difference was explained in terms\nof the ion orbits being more complicated due to the E \u0002 B\nconvection and the gradient\/curvature drifts acting in op-\nposing directions. Thus protons spend a relatively longer\ntime along their drift paths, and losses outweigh the\ninjection of fresh plasma. McComas et al. [2002] have\nshown that the emission of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs)\nin the energy range 1\u201370 keV can allow the imaging of\nregions of high and low plasma sheet density.\n[5] With regard to the local time region of the injection,\nBirn et al. [1997] showed that the electron and proton\nsubstorm injection regions are not colocated. The electron\ninjections tend to occur between 1 and 2 hours following\nlocal midnight, while proton injections typically occur in the\nhour before local midnight. This offset was confirmed by\nsimultaneous, multisatellite observations [Thomsen et al.,\n2001]. Thus there are clear differences both in the proton\nand electron access to the inner magnetosphere and in their\nbehavior once injected.\n[6] Korth et al. [1999] showed that the plasma sheet\ndensity and access increase with Kp. Times of elevated Kp\nare often storm periods. Thus one might expect that storm\nperiods would also be periods of enhanced plasma sheet\ndensity. Indeed, for a limited set of storms, it has been\nshown that the Dst index [Sugiura, 1964], a measure of the\nstorm time ring current, is correlated with the plasma sheet\ndensity [Thomsen et al., 1998]. Since the plasma sheet is the\nsource of the ring current (delivered to the inner magneto-\nsphere via geosynchronous orbit), it is clearly important to\nunderstand the properties of the plasma at geosynchronous\norbit with respect to the ring current strength. In addition,\nthe Kp and Dst indices respond differently to different solar\nwind parameters. Kp is more sensitive to changes in solar\nwind speed, while Dst is more sensitive to changes in the\ninterplanetary magnetic field (IMF) [e.g., Feynman, 1980].\nIn addition, Kp and Dst also behave differently within the\nsolar cycle. Kp is relatively more sensitive to recurrent\nactivity such as corotating interactive streams (CIRs),\nwhereas Dst is more sensitive to transient activity such as\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs) [e.g., Vennerstr\u00f8m and\nFriis-Christensen, 1996].\n[7] In this study we perform a statistical analysis to\ndetermine the bulk properties of the plasma sheet as a\nfunction of the Dst index. The delivery and density of\nplasma sheet material is known to be enhanced during\nperiods of strong magnetospheric convection. We investi-\ngate this enhancement during the storm times which often\naccompany periods of enhanced convection. By performing\na superposed epoch analysis, we analyze how the bulk\nplasma parameters vary spatially and temporally throughout\nthe evolution of a storm.\n[8] The solar cycle dependence of various processes\nwithin the magnetosphere has previously been well docu-\nmented. Ionospheric densities, auroral phenomena, and the\noccurrence of geomagnetic storms are all solar cycle de-\npendent. Thus it appears likely that the delivery of plasma\nsheet material to the inner magnetosphere will also follow\nthe solar cycle to some degree, simply because the frequency\nof storms and the convection electric field are also solar cycle\ndependent. We demonstrate for the first time that electron\ndensity in the plasma sheet is a function of solar cycle. It is\nalso known that some fraction of the plasma sheet is of\nionospheric origin. Since the densities of various ions within\nthe ionosphere are known to fluctuate with the solar cycle\n[e.g.,Heelis et al., 1990;West et al., 1997;Denton and Bailey,\n2001], we calculate an inferred O+ density at geosynchronous\norbit and determine the inferred density variation with the\nstrength of the magnetospheric convection and solar\ncycle.\n[9] To summarize, the main objectives of this study are to\nascertain the dependence of the bulk properties of the\nplasma at geosynchronous orbit with respect to the Dst\nindex, local time, storm phase, and solar cycle. A database\nof magnetospheric plasma analyzer (MPA) measurements\nfrom five Los Alamos geosynchronous satellites, covering a\nfull solar cycle, provides the data used in this study. The\nresults both improve our understanding of plasma sheet\nentry during disturbed conditions and provide an additional\nconstraint on the boundary conditions of ring current\nmodels. The plasma sheet electron density is shown to\ndepend greatly upon solar activity and this dependence is\nquantified between 1990 and 2001. The fraction of O+\npresent at geosynchronous orbit is estimated and shown to\nbe highly dependent upon solar activity and the magneto-\nspheric convection strength.\n2. Instrumentation\n[10] Data for this study are provided by the MPA instru-\nments flown by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)\non several satellites in geosynchronous orbit. The full data-\nset extends from 1989 to the present, covering more than an\nentire 11 year solar cycle. The MPA instrument is an\nelectrostatic analyzer which measures the three-dimensional\nenergy-per-charge distributions of ions and electrons between\n\u00011 eV\/q and \u000145 keV\/q at a time cadence of one 10-s\nsnapshot every 86 s. For this study we use the spin-averaged\nmoments computed from the full distributions [Thomsen et\nal., 1999], including densities, temperatures, and temperature\nanisotropies. Although there are no magnetometers on board\nthe LANL satellites, the magnetic field direction can be\nderived from the symmetry axis of the three-dimensional\nparticle distributions, allowing identification of the compo-\nnents of the temperature parallel and perpendicular to the field\n[Thomsen et al., 1999].\n[11] In the current study moments of the particle distri-\nbution are analyzed for the hot electrons (HE) in the energy\nrange 30 eV to \u000145 keV, the hot protons (HP) in the energy\nrange 100 eV to \u000145 keV and low-energy protons (LP) in\nthe energy range 1 to 100 eV. The ion moments are\ncalculated under the assumption that the entire ion popula-\ntion consists of protons; however, we will also discuss how,\nunder certain conditions, the ion composition may be\ninferred from MPA observations. A full description of the\nMPA instrument has been provided by Bame et al. [1993]\nand McComas et al. [1993].\n3. Data Coverage and Processing\n[12] The data used in the following analyses come from\ngeosynchronous satellites 1990-095, 1991-080, 1994-084,\nLANL-97A, and LANL-01A for the period between 1990\nA07223 DENTON ET AL.: BULK PLASMA PROPERTIES AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT\n2 of 17\nA07223\nand 2001, satellites being launched in the periods between\nthese years, so there are relatively more data in the later\nyears. The data are processed using a method similar to that\napplied by Korth et al. [1999]. Magnetospheric and bound-\nary layer events are culled from the analysis by only\naccepting data points where the proton density is less than\n3 cm\u00033 and the perpendicular proton temperature is greater\nthan 2000 eV.\n[13] The aim of the analysis is to determine the variation\nof the plasma parameters with respect to the Dst index\n[Sugiura, 1964], a proxy for the strength of the global ring\ncurrent. However, to compare with the work initially\npresented by Korth et al. [1999], the data were first binned\ninto one of 24 hour-width local time bins and one of 27 Kp\nbins. This extension of the Korth et al. [1999] results has the\nbenefit of improving the statistics of the original analysis,\nparticularly for periods of the highest Kp values (and\nstrongest convection). For the Dst analysis, the data were\nbinned into 24 local time bins and 51 Dst bins from \u0003400 to\n+100 nT. The output plots are produced on a grid of Dst\n(from \u0003200 to +40 nT, the range where data coverage is\ngenerally good) and local time. Data from a given bin were\nonly included in the final plot if there were more that five\ndata points in the bin.\n[14] Calculation of the ion and electron moments pro-\nvides their respective temperatures in the parallel and\nperpendicular directions, with respect to the derived mag-\nnetic field direction. The derivation of the field direction is\nonly possible when the distribution is sufficiently aniso-\ntropic [Thomsen et al., 1999], but knowledge of the field\ndirection is unnecessary when the distribution is too isotro-\npic for its determination since in that case the perpendicular\nand parallel temperatures are approximately equal anyway.\nIn the analysis, the temperature is calculated as two-thirds\ntimes of the perpendicular temperature plus one-third of the\nparallel temperature, for each data point. The electron and\nproton pressures are defined as the product of the respective\ntemperatures and densities. We also derive a parameter for\nthe hot protons, the inverse entropy, which is calculated as\nN\n5=3\nHP =PHP; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere NHP is the hot proton density and PHP is the hot\nproton pressure. This parameter is intended to highlight\nregions of cold, dense plasma sheet material, the subject of\ninvestigation for a number of authors [e.g., Lennartsson and\nShelley, 1986; Terasawa et al., 1997; Fujimoto et al., 1998;\nPhan et al., 2000; Huang et al., 2002; Thomsen et al.,\n2003]. Cold dense plasma has been observed in the midtail\nplasma sheet typically during periods of northward IMF.\nThomsen et al. [2003] observed that this population may be\ndelivered into the inner magnetosphere under conditions of\neither sudden southward IMF following an extended period\nof northward IMF or during a very strong magnetospheric\ncompression, caused by a large increase in solar wind\ndynamic pressure.\n[15] To further extend the analysis of the plasma behavior\nat geosynchronous orbit during disturbed conditions we\nexamine the bulk plasma parameters from 283 storm peri-\nods identified between 1990 and 2001 by means of a\nsuperposed epoch study. Taking the zero epoch for each\nstorm as the period when the Dst index was at a minimum,\nwe bin all data with respect to the epoch time and with\nrespect to local time. The resulting statistics provide clues as\nto when during the storm process the major injection of\nplasma occurs and the temperature of the injected plasma\nand its anisotropy.\n4. Results and Discussion\n4.1. Kp Dependence\n[16] This analysis creates averages of various bulk plasma\nparameters, between 1990 and 2001, as a function of Kp and\nlocal time. Bins with fewer than five data points are colored\ngray. Bins where the value of the plotted parameter falls\nabove the maximum index on the scale are colored white.\nAll plots, with the exception of the sample statistics plot, are\nsmoothed using a boxcar average, the aim being to highlight\nthe broad features of each parameter but without removing\nsmall-scale features. Approximately 4.5 \u0002 106 data points\nare used in the analysis.\n[17] Figure 1 shows the sample statistics and the low-\nenergy proton density averaged between 1990 and 2001 as a\nFigure 1.

As may be expected, there\nare many more samples for values of Kp < 4 than for Kp >\n4, reflecting the relatively greater occurrence of periods of\nlow magnetospheric convection. The LP density plot shows\na population that is distributed primarily on the dayside, in\nthe afternoon sector, and that is eroded as Kp increases. The\nLP particles are of ionospheric origin and results from\nupflow into closed flux tubes that approximately corotate\nwith the Earth. Plasma in these tubes is lost during periods\nof increased convection when particles on previously closed\ndrift paths may transition to open drift paths that drain to the\nmagnetopause. That a significant population of cold protons\nis observed indicates the presence of ionospheric plasma at\ngeosynchronous orbit in the afternoon, for low values of Kp.\nThe average density of this cold population is at a maximum\nin the postnoon sector and is significantly depleted at later\nlocal times for stronger convection, when drainage to the\nmagnetosphere is enhanced. The LP population varies\nalmost inversely to the HP and HE plasma sheet populations\nshown in Figure 2.\n[18] Figure 2 shows the HP and HE densities, perpendic-\nular and parallel temperatures, temperature anisotropies, and\npressures, as a function of Kp and local time. The HP and\nHE densities from Figure 2 may be compared directly with\nthe proton and electron densities of Korth et al. [1999,\nPlate 4], where data from three satellites during 1996\nwere analyzed. Similar features are readily identified in\nboth analyses, particularly a peak in the HP and HE\ndensity slightly postmidnight and a decrease from this\npeak toward dawn and dusk. At Kp values >\u00014, and\nparticularly >6 (where there is a lack of data in the Korth\net al. [1999] analysis), there appears to be some evidence\nof a minimum in the HP and HE densities around local\nmidnight, with a suggestion of two separate populations,\none located premidnight and one postmidnight. This is\npossibly due to the severity of such high Kp storms and\nthe dominance of plasma energized above the MPA\nmaximum detection energy of \u000145 keV and therefore\nnot unresolved. Both the HP and HE densities are slightly\nhigher close to dawn for the higher values of Kp. For low\nvalues of Kp, the peak in HP density is located very\nclose to local midnight and the HE density peak is slightly\npostmidnight. This agrees with Thomsen et al. [1998] obser-\nvations and results presented by Korth et al. [1999].\n[19] The HP and HE perpendicular and parallel temper-\natures and the perpendicular-to-parallel temperature ratios\nshown in Figure 2 demonstrate that temperature is also\nhighly correlated with Kp and local time. As stated by Korth\net al. [1999], the temperature profiles reflect the accessibil-\nity of high-energy particles. It is clear that the HP temper-\nature has its peak between 1200 and 2400 LT. The parallel\ntemperature peak is found in the premidnight sector, while\nthe perpendicular temperature peak is found in the afternoon\nsector. The causes for this are unclear. As the protons drift to\nthe dayside, the magnetic field strength increases, causing\nadiabatic heating in the perpendicular direction. The fall in\nthe parallel temperature toward dawn is likely caused by the\nhigher-energy fraction of the distribution being lost due to\nprecipitation of the field-aligned component. The resulting\nHP temperature anisotropy, which develops on the dayside\nwith increased Kp, occurs due to an increase in T? (likely\ndue to the increased magnetic field) combined with a\ndecrease in Tk (likely due to an increased loss of field-\naligned particles through precipitation). In the region close\nto midnight, fresh plasma sheet material, with an isotropic\ntemperature distribution, is observed. The location of this\nisotropic population is observed to widen in local time with\nincreasing values of Kp. In general, the perpendicular-to-\nparallel temperature ratio shows how the population\nbecomes more anisotropic as it \u2018\u2018ages,\u2019\u2019 related to the time\nit spends within the inner magnetosphere. Fresh material\ntypically has an isotropic distribution. However, since field-\naligned particles are lost via precipitation, a stronger\nanisotropy develops as time passes. Loss of the proton\npopulation can also proceed by charge-exchange which is\nparticularly important for H+ ions with energies below\n\u000140 keV.\n[20] For the hot electrons, the peak temperature in both\nperpendicular and parallel components is observed just after\nlocal midnight. Typically, there is reduced HE access to\ngeosynchronous orbit premidnight [Korth et al., 1999]. For\nhigher Kp values, the peak temperature postmidnight is\nlikely due to heating accompanying the substorm injection\nof plasma sheet electrons.\n[21] The HE perpendicular-to-parallel temperature ratio\ndemonstrates that the electrons are already largely aniso-\ntropic at their arrival at geosynchronous orbit. Loss pro-\ncesses have already produced a perpendicular anisotropy,\nlikely indicating that field-aligned particles have been\npreferentially precipitated out of the distribution as they\nmirror closer to the Earth. As convection strength increases,\nthere is typically less time for precipitation to occur and the\ndistribution is more isotropic, particularly for the electrons\narriving to local midnight during the highest convection\nperiods.\n[22] The HP pressure shown in Figure 2 is similar to that\npresented by Korth et al. [1999]. The HP temperature and\ndensity have significant nighttime gradients; however, their\nvariations largely cancel each other leaving a fairly uniform\nHP pressure on the nightside. The HE pressure highlights\nthe region of plasma sheet electron access. The newly\ndelivered electrons are both hot and more dense than the\nresidual population within the closed drift path region.\n[23] Figure 3 shows the HE\/HP density ratio and the HP\ninverse entropy. This HE\/HP density ratio is the ratio of\nelectrons to protons in their respective energy ranges.\nQuasi-neutrality is still assumed even when the ratio is\nnot \u00011. The HP density ratio highlights the geosynchronous\naccess boundaries of the electrons compared with the\nprotons. Electrons do not have access to the dusk region\n(modulated with Kp) and this causes a minimum in the HE\/\nHP ratio in this region. For periods of high convection there\nis an increase in the ratio. This can be explained by the\ninjection of fresh plasma from the plasma sheet, centered\nclose to midnight, which spreads in local time with increas-\ning Kp.\n[24] The HP inverse entropy shown in Figure 3 highlights\nregions of where the plasma is cold and dense in nature.\nSuch plasma is typically of greatest concentrations in the\npostdawn region, during times of strong convection. In this\nregion the density is enhanced and the plasma is relatively\ncool. There is also an increase in the inverse entropy in the\nregion around dusk, for periods when the convection is high\n(Kp > 7), compared with low convection intervals.\nA07223 DENTON ET AL.: BULK PLASMA PROPERTIES AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT\n5 of 17\nA07223\n4.2. Dst Dependence\n[25] Figures 4, 5, and 6 show the same dataset as plotted\nin Figures 1, 2, and 3 but now ordered as a function of the\nDst index (i.e., ordered with the respect to the strength of\nthe ring current rather than the strength of the convection)\nand local time. The aim of this analysis is to elucidate any\neffects particular to the ring current enhancement measured\nby Dst rather than the convection dependent ordering\nindexed by Kp.\n[26] Figure 4 shows the sample statistics and the low-\nenergy proton density averaged between 1990 and 2001 as a\nfunction of Dst and local time. The sample statistics show\nthe data in this analysis are clustered around periods of quiet\nto moderate storm activity (a Dst index of \u00010 to \u000340 nT). It\nis also clear that the low-energy protons are well ordered\nwith Dst. The LP density displays a distribution close to the\ninverse of the HE distribution (shown in Figure 5) and the\nsame explanation of its distribution is valid, namely that\nregions of high LP density correspond to plasmaspheric\nplasma of ionospheric origin which has accumulated due to\ntime spent on closed drift paths. The regions of low LP\ndensity correspond to regions where this plasma may drift to\nthe magnetopause under enhanced convection conditions.\nThe low LP densities centered slightly postmidnight indi-\ncate regions where fresh, hot plasma sheet electrons are\ninjected during storms. This region broadens with increas-\ning storm strength.\n[27] Figure 5 shows the HP and HE densities, perpendic-\nular and parallel temperatures, temperature anisotropies and\npressures as a function of Kp and local time. A noticeable\ndifference between the densities shown here and those\nshown in Figure 2 is the presence of a density enhancement\nduring periods of positive Dst, corresponding to times of\nmagnetospheric compressions following sudden impulses.\nThese increases in density are an indication of the injection\nof plasma sheet material that leads to an increased ring\ncurrent and the subsequent drop in Dst. This signature of\nenhanced plasma delivery is centered close to midnight for\nthe HP plasma and postmidnight for the HE plasma. For\nperiods of negative Dst, the temperature, density, and\npressure distributions display features very similar to those\nfound in the Kp analysis. The dense high-energy proton\npopulation observed around dawn for high values of Dst is\nalso quite cool and, as previously suggested by Thomsen et\nFigure 3.

[2003], this may correspond to a cold dense plasma sheet\npopulation.\n[28] The HP and HE parallel and perpendicular temper-\natures and their perpendicular-to-parallel temperature ratios\nshown in Figure 5 contain several features similar to those\nevident in the Kp analysis. In broad terms, the HP temper-\nature and the degree of temperature anisotropy show peaks\nat around 1400 and 2100 LT for the perpendicular and\nparallel distributions, respectively. The HP distribution is at\nits most isotropic centered close to midnight and in a local\ntime region which increases in width with increasingly\nnegative Dst values. The peaks in the HE temperatures\nshow maxima close to midnight, for values around \u000360 nT,\nin both the perpendicular and parallel components. The HE\ndistribution is also at its most isotropic in broadly the same\nregion. This implies that freshly delivered plasma, more\nisotropic in distribution, is colocated with the region of\ngreatest heating.\n[29] The HE and HP pressures shown in Figure 5 dem-\nonstrate a correlation with Dst and local time. Clearly, the\nions, assumed to be protons, make the greatest contribution\nto the total pressure. The HP pressure shows an increase at\nthe start of the storm (positive Dst) and, compared with\ntimes of zero Dst, this pressure increases with increasing\nDst and can spread across the entire nightside. During\nperiods where Dst <\u000340 nT the pressure is increased at\nall local times, compared with periods of low ring current\nactivity, with a peak in the HP pressure close to dusk. Since\nthe pressure is calculated from the product of the density\nand temperature, the pressure distribution reflects both\nquantities. As noted by Korth et al. [1999], regions of\nhigh-pressure gradients reflect regions where currents are\nflowing. The proton density and temperature have signifi-\ncant gradients; however, the two quantities combine to\nproduces a pressure distribution that is peaked in the dawn\nand dusk sectors, largely as a result of the peaks in the HP\ndensity in these regions.\n[30] The HE pressure shows a quiet-time peak located\nclose to local midnight. This pressure peak broadens sub-\nstantially with increasingly positive or negative Dst. The\nregion of increased HE pressure spreads during increasingly\npositive Dst and widens in local time. For increasingly\nnegative Dst, the pressure is enhanced in magnitude and its\nlocation spreads in local time, but this enhancement does\nnot extend beyond around 1800 LT, even for very strong\nstorms. Fresh electron plasma sheet access to geosynchro-\nnous orbit is very much restricted in the afternoon sector, as\nshown by Korth et al. [1999], thus resulting in little increase\nin pressure in this region, even for the strongest storms.\n[31] Figure 6 shows the HE\/HP density ratio and the HP\ninverse entropy as functions of Dst and local time.\nClearly, the HE\/HP density ratio is lowest in the postnoon\nregion due to the lack of HE access in the postnoon\nregion. For increasingly negative Dst there is an increase\nin the ratio that is maximised prior to midnight for Dst\nvalues <\u0003100 nT.\n[32] The HP inverse entropy highlights regions where a\ndenser, colder plasma sheet population exists. Figure 6\nshows the delivery of cold dense plasma sheet material is\nmaximized in the postdawn region during the times when\nthe ring current is highly strengthened (Dst < \u0003100). Why\ncold dense plasma sheet material should preferentially enter\non the dawnside is currently being investigated. The HP\ndensity is elevated at both dawn and dusk times during\nenhanced activity. However, the HP temperature on the\nduskside is consistently higher than that at dawn; thus the\ninverse entropy parameter is greatest in the dawn region.\n4.3. Storm Superposed Epoch Analysis\n[33] To further understand the time evolution and struc-\nture of the plasma at geosynchronous orbit during disturbed\nconditions, particularly during enhanced ring current activ-\nity, we carry out a superposed epoch analysis of 283 storms\nthat occurred between 1991 and 2001. These storms were\nselected as periods when clear negative excursions in the\nDst index were observed. To be classed as a storm, the\ninterval had to have a minimum Dst of \u000350 nT or less.\nUpon inspection, the interval was required to have an initial\nphase lasting minutes to hours, a main phase lasting 30 min\nto several hours, and a recovery phase lasting tens of hours\nto a week. The zero epoch for the study was taken as the\nminimum value of Dst for each storm, following a sudden\nfall from a prestorm value.\n[34] Once the zero epoch has been selected, data are\nbinned into one of 24 local time bins and one of 96 bins\nFigure 6.

Data are shown from 1 day before to 2 1\/2 days after the\nzero epoch. No smoothing is performed on the plots pro-\nduced. The results are summarized below, and their implica-\ntions are discussed more fully in section 5.\n[35] Figure 7 shows the superposed Dst and Kp indices,\nthe sample statistics, and the low-energy proton density for\nthe 283 storms selected. It is clear from the superposed\nindices that the average convection strength for this collec-\ntion of storms, measured by Kp, peaks prior to the minimum\nDst. It should also be noted that even 1 full day before the\nzero epoch, the averaged conditions were not totally\n\u2018\u2018quiet.\u2019\u2019 The averaged Kp was \u00012+ and the averaged\nDst was \u0001\u000320.\n[36] The LP density is initially quite low on the nightside\nand in the morning sector and appears depleted further\nduring the storm. In the afternoon sector the density is\ninitially high and may be enhanced slightly around zero-\nepoch. These low-energy particles may exist on closed drift\npaths, and the associated flux tubes fill from the ionosphere\nas a result of continual day-time production in the iono-\nsphere. As flux tubes migrate across the dayside, the flux of\ncold ionospheric plasma increases, giving the highest den-\nsities in the afternoon. As the storm progresses, the con-\nvection electric field is enhanced, causing a reduction in the\nLP population due to enhanced drainage to the magneto-\npause. Another possibility is that the peak close to zero\nepoch in the afternoon sector represents the plasmaspheric\ndrainage plume which, as the storm progresses and convec-\ntion weakens, thins and disappears from view. The plasma-\nsphere is known to take many days to refill following a\nstorm [e.g., Kersley and Klobuchar, 1978], and hence the\nLP densitymay not return to its prestorm value, even 48 hours\nafter minimum Dst.\n[37] Figure 8 shows the HP and HE densities, perpendic-\nular and parallel temperatures, the temperature anisotropies,\nand the pressures as a function of storm-epoch time and\nlocal time. The HP density is clearly enhanced close to local\nmidnight, around 12 hours before the storm minimum and\nthis density enhancement appears to spread across the entire\nnightside and even onto the dayside as the storm progresses.\nThe results indicate that the plasma sheet density is at its\nhighest during the main phase of the storm. The density at\ngeosynchronous orbit falls back to or even below a prestorm\nlevel between 24 and 36 hours after zero epoch.\n[38] The HE density in Figure 8 also shows a strong\nincrease for periods before minimum Dst, corresponding to\nthe main phase of the storm. The strongest enhancement in\nHE density occurs around and just prior to dawn. No\nenhancement is registered for local times between 1200\nand 1800 LT. This is because plasma sheet electrons in this\nenergy range do not have access to this region of geosyn-\nchronous orbit. Enhanced HE densities are registered more\nthan 24 hours after the minimum Dst, but it is less clear,\ncompared with the HP analysis, when the density returns to\na prestorm minimum. Assuming a prestorm density in the\nregion close to midnight (see Figure 2) of 1.0 cm\u00033, we\nsuggest the HE density returns to a prestorm value at least\n24 hours after minimum Dst.\n[39] Figure 8 also shows the superposed epoch study for\nthe HP and HE parallel and perpendicular temperatures and\ntheir degree of anisotropy. The HP perpendicular tempera-\nture peaks at over 10,000 eV, just after midday, although\napart from this enhancement, the HP temperature appears to\nvary little with storm phase. The parallel HP temperature\npeaks at around 8000 eV between dusk and local midnight\nand appears to fall slightly following minimum Dst. The HP\ntemperature ratio is clearly closest to isotropy around zero\nepoch near to local midnight. At zero epoch the isotropic\nFigure 7.

The\nHE population also appears to be at its most isotropic close\nto the zero epoch when the isotropy extends to the broadest\nregion of local time, again indicating the delivery of fresher\nplasma sheet material.\n[41] Since both the HP and HE temperatures in Figure 8\nshow only a limited variation with storm phase, the HE and\nHP storm-epoch pressure variations are largely dominated\nby the variation in the HP and HE densities. The HP\npressure peaks prior to zero epoch, with the peak moving\nto the dusk region as the storm progresses. The HE peak is\nlocated prior to dawn and prior to zero epoch, when a\nsignificant pressure enhancement is observed between 2400\nand 0600 LT. Little change is evident in the afternoon HE\npressure since the electrons are restricted from entering this\nregion. The postmidnight peak in HE pressure is maximised\nprior to minimum Dst and falls off to prestorm levels over\nthe following 12 to 24 hours.\n[42] Figure 9 shows the HE\/HP density ratio and the HP\ninverse entropy plotted as a function of storm epoch and\nlocal time. The density ratio is enhanced close to dawn\naround 12 hours prior to zero epoch, largely as a result of\nthe relatively high HE density in this region. The HP inverse\nentropy is maximised around 0800 LT just prior to zero\nepoch, again indicating that the dawn region may be\noccupied by unusually cold, dense plasma sheet material\nduring the main phase of the storm.\n4.4. Solar Cycle Dependence\n[43] Figure 10 shows the electron density at geosynchro-\nnous orbit as a function of solar cycle, Kp, and local time.\nThe Kp index was used in preference to the Dst index for\nthis analysis due to the strong relation between electron\naccess to the magnetosphere and the convection electric\nfield. Data are binned into 24 local time bins and 27 Kp\nbins. Bins containing less than five points are colored gray.\nData with values higher than the maximum range of the\ncolor bar are colored white. Figure 10 shows the HE density\nas a function of local time and Kp for the 12 years between\n1990 and 2001, inclusive. It is clear that both solar activity\nand the convection electric field have a strong bearing on\ndensity levels of HE at geosynchronous orbit. During\nextremely quiet solar activity, for example during 1996,\nthe electron density rarely exceeds 1.0 cm\u00033. In contrast,\nduring periods of high solar activity, for example 2001, the\ndensity is typically \u00011.5 cm\u00033 in all regions where the\nplasma sheet electrons have access, even during quiet\nconvection periods (Kp < 3). For all years, the HE density\nrises as a function of Kp and is also enhanced over a wider\nrange of local times. The latter property was clearly\nrevealed in the solar minimum data presented by Korth et\nal. [1999], but the increase of density with Kp was not as\nobvious during the year studied (1996) as it is for the other,\nmore active years in the solar cycle. The magnitude of the\nvariation in HE density with Kp and the solar cycle is\npresented explicitly in Figure 11. This figure shows a\nstraight line fit to the HE density between 1991 and 2001,\nat 0300 LT over a full 11 year solar cycle. (1990 is excluded\nfrom the fits due to the limited data availability). Here\n0300 LT was used to quantify the HE variation since it is\nthe time at which high values of electron density are seen\nfor all values of Kp (see Figure 2). The standard deviations\nfrom each straight line fit are shown in brackets with the\nplots colored to represent their temporal location in the\nsolar cycle, red for solar maximum, and black for solar\nminimum.\n[44] The ion composition of the inner magnetosphere is\nknown to change throughout the solar cycle [e.g., Young et\nal., 1982]. The composition is also known to change during\nlarge storms as the outflow of ionospheric O+ increases\n[e.g., Lockwood et al., 1985; Yau et al., 1985; Lennartsson,\n1988; Daglis et al., 1999; Fu et al., 2001] The source of the\nadditional O+ detected in the plasma sheet is the ionosphere.\nAt times of high solar activity, the Earth\u2019s neutral atmo-\nsphere expands due to increased incident solar EUV radi-\nation. This heating elevates the heavier constituents of the\nneutral atmosphere and the proportion of these that become\nionized is increased in comparison to periods of low solar\nactivity, as shown by several observational and theoretical\nstudies [e.g., Bailey and Sellek, 1990; West et al., 1997;\nFigure 9.

In the high-latitude region these\nions and electrons travel tailward, are energized, and may\nenter the plasma sheet and then be injected back into the\ninner magnetosphere on the nightside. Such outflow from\nthe auroral ionosphere means that heavy ions, including O+\nand He+, and electrons are found in relatively greater\nproportions within the magnetosphere during such times.\nSimilarly, a greater proportion of heavier ions and electrons\nwill be detected in the plasma sheet during elevated solar\nactivity and during storm periods.\n[45] It is known that the composition of O+ in the inner\nmagnetosphere increases with solar activity [e.g., Young et\nal., 1982], and more specifically with the solar EUV flux\n[e.g., Lund and Mo\u00a8bius, 2000]. The MPA instrument\ncannot directly detect ion composition, and in computing\nthe moments summarized above, the ion population is\nassumed to be entirely composed of H+. However, under\nthe following conditions the MPA measurements may be\nused to estimate the concentration of O+: (1) the hot\nplasma sheet populations measured by MPA (30 eV to\n45 keV for the electrons and 100 eV to 45 keV for the\nions) are much denser than any lower-energy populations\npresent and that (2) the contribution of higher-energy\nparticles (>45 keV) to the density of either species is\nnegligible.\n[46] The technique described below is only applicable in\nregions where both of these conditions are met. In the dusk\nsector, electrons do not have access to the inner magneto-\nsphere [Korth et al., 1999] and the relations described\nbelow cannot be used. Close to local midnight, the number\nof electrons and ions entering the inner magnetosphere in\nthis energy range are likely to be in balance. In this region,\nfreshly injected plasma is found to have a HE\/HP density\nratio close to unity (see Figure 2), and the LP density is\ntypically low (see Figure 1), and thus the method of\nderiving composition can be more readily trusted.\n[47] The hot electrons density measured by MPA is the\nsum of electrons from all ionized atoms. Thus during\nperiods when O+ is present (and neglecting the contribution\nof other ions) then, from charge neutrality, the density of the\nhot electrons, NHE, is given by\nNHE \u00bc NH\u00fe \u00fe NO\u00fe; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere NH+ is the H\n+ density and NO+ is O\n+ density.\n[48] The MPA instrument is an E\/q analyzer and for\nnormal operations the measured population is assumed to\nconsist entirely of protons. From calculation of the velocity\ndistribution function [Thomsen et al., 1999], the contribu-\ntion to the total ion density of an ion species of mass mi is\ngiven by\np\nmp=mi\n\u0001 \u0002\n; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere mp is the proton mass. Thus assuming that the total\nnumber of electrons and protons is equal, the nominal hot\nproton density, NHP, is given by\nNHP \u00bc NH\u00fe \u00fe NO\u00fe=4: \u00f04\u00de\nEquations (2) and (4) can be rearranged and solved for the\nhydrogen density and the oxygen density so\nNO\u00fe \u00bc 4=3 NHE \u0003 NHP\u00f0 \u00de \u00f05\u00de\nand\nNH\u00fe \u00bc \u00f04NHP \u0003 NHE\u00de=3: \u00f06\u00de\n[49] The O+\/H+ density ratio was calculated for the years\n1990 to 2001 as a function of Kp and local time. These\nresults are likely to not be valid in regions away from the\nlocal midnight, since, particularly close to dusk, electrons\ndo not have access to geosynchronous orbit and the electron\nand proton numbers are not equal (see Figure 2). However,\napplying the method to the entire data set produces the\nresults displayed in Figure 12. The gray bins in this case are\nregions where either the number of samples in each bin was\nless than five or where NHP > NHE. The figure clearly shows\nthe solar activity dependence of the derived O+\/H+ density\nratio.\n[50] To quantify the inferred O+ and H+ densities and\ntheir ratio as a function of Kp and solar activity, the\ndensities at 0300 LT, where the equivalence of hot ion\nand hot electron density is most likely and where there is a\nnegligible low-energy population, were fit to a straight line\nfor each year between 1991 to 2001, inclusive, a full 11 year\nsolar cycle. The resulting straight line fits to the data are\nshown in Figure 13 along with the standard deviation from\nthe fit shown in brackets. The lines in Figure 13 are colored\naccording to year, with red representing data from solar\nmaximum (defined as 1991 and 2001) and black represent-\ning data from solar minimum (1996). Both the H+ and O+\nderived densities in this energy range are correlated with the\nconvection electric field, proxied by Kp, and clearly, also\nwith the solar cycle.\n[51] During low solar activity, best characterized by the\nresults from 1996, the H+ density increases with increasing\nKp, while the O+ density remains low. It has been estimated\nFigure 11. The averaged HE density at 0300 LT plotted as\na function of the Kp index and year in the solar cycle\nbetween 1991 and 2001.

Hence it may be\nexpected that an increase in solar activity will lead to an\nincrease in ionospheric outflow of H+ and thus an increase\nin plasma sheet H+. During years of elevated solar activity,\nFigures 12 and 13 demonstrate that the proportion of O+ and\nH+, and also the O+\/H+ density ratio increases with increas-\ning solar activity. These results indicate that during the years\nclose to solar maximum, for periods of high convection, the\nO+ density approaches 50% of the total plasma sheet ion\ndensity.\n5. Conclusions and Future Work\n[52] We have presented a comprehensive analysis of bulk\nplasma parameters at geosynchronous orbit and the rela-\ntionship between the HE and HP densities and temperatures\nand various derived bulk plasma parameters as a function of\nKp, Dst, and storm phase. We have analyzed the HE density\nas a function of solar cycle and, in addition, have derived\nthe O+ and H+ densities under certain conditions and the\ncorresponding O+\/H+ ratio as a function of solar cycle.\n[53] The results of the extended analysis of the bulk\nplasma parameters with Kp confirm the strong correlation\nof the HP, HE, and LP densities with the Kp index. In part,\nthis is due to whether plasma has access to geosynchronous\norbit. The LP density is typically high during quiet periods\nand is reduced as plasma drains to the magnetopause during\nstorm times, with a strong local time dependence. We\nsimilarly conclude that plasma sheet access to geosynchro-\nnous orbit is strongly correlated with Dst and local time, for\nmany of the same reasons. Since storm periods when the\nring current is enhanced may also be periods of high\nmagnetospheric convection, the arguments presented by\nKorth et al. [1999] are valid to describe particle access\nand behavior.\n[54] The HP temperature shows a strong diurnal asym-\nmetry when plotted with respect to both Kp and Dst.\nProtons in the afternoon and premidnight sectors have a\nmuch higher perpendicular and parallel temperature com-\npared with protons in the postmidnight and morning sectors.\nThis temperature asymmetry may be due to the different\npaths the protons take through the system. Protons which\nare injected close to local midnight can pass the Earth on\neither the dawnside or duskside. Protons which follow paths\nto the duskside appear to be heated more strongly in both\nthe perpendicular and parallel directions than protons which\npass to the dawnside. For the hot electrons, their tempera-\nture appears to be maximized in the region close to local\nmidnight. It is likely that the increase in HE temperature in\nthis region is associated with delivery of fresh material to\nthe inner magnetosphere.\n[55] It is interesting to note that the highest HP density,\ntypically observed for the highest Kp and most negative Dst\nintervals, is at dawn, where the plasma is relatively cold.\nThis is consistent with the findings of Thomsen et al.\n[2003], who suggest the strongest storms should follow\nperiods of northward IMF, when the plasma sheet can fill\nwith cold, dense plasma, followed by an extended interval\nof strong southward IMF which delivers this plasma into the\ninner magnetosphere.\n[56] The solar cycle dependence of HE density at geo-\nsynchronous orbit has been demonstrated for the first time.\nThe HE density at solar maximum can be on average almost\ndouble that at solar minimum. HE density is also strongly\nFigure 13. The inferred O+ and H+ density and the O+\/H+\ndensity ratio at 0300 LT plotted as a function of Kp and year\nin the solar cycle between 1990 and 2001.

The implication of this result is an enhanced source of\nhot electrons during high solar activity, from either the solar\nwind or the ionosphere or, more probably, from both.\n[57] The ratio of plasma sheet O+ to H+ density is\nsignificantly greater at solar maximum than solar minimum.\nThe ratio is also higher during periods of enhanced con-\nvection. These effects are assumed to be due to the solar\ncycle and storm time enhancement in ionospheric concen-\ntrations in both constituents and their resulting outflow from\nthe ionosphere, their entry into the plasma sheet, and\nsubsequent reentry into the inner magnetosphere. Both the\nO+ and the H+ densities are enhanced during solar maxi-\nmum and high convection periods. However, the O+\nincreases by a greater amount and hence the overall O+\/\nH+ density increases.\n[58] The results of this study are intended to provide an\nimproved set of parameters with which to constrain the\nboundary conditions of ring current models. Knowledge of\nthe temporal evolution of the plasma during storms and\nlocal time regions where plasma sheet entry can occur will\nhopefully encourage the development of improvements to\nmodels and a better description of the ring current that\nevolves from this source population.\n[59] Two subjects suggest themselves for further study.\nFirst, as indicated by Thomsen et al. [2003], the presence of\ncold dense plasma sheet material at geosynchronous orbit is\nrelated to the strength of storms. The results show that cold\ndense plasma appears to be present more strongly at dawn\nthan dusk, and the cause of this is currently being investi-\ngated. However, it is also known that the formation of the\ncold dense plasma sheet is dependent upon the IMF BZ\norientation, and hence ordering the MPA data set with\nrespect to this parameter would allow a quantification of\nhow dependent the cold dense plasma sheet is upon IMF BZ.\nSecond, to further investigate how the size of storm affects\nthe formation of the ring current, it would be useful to order\nthe superposed epoch data according to the minimum Dst\nfor each storm. How is the temporal delivery of plasma\nsheet material different, if at all, for small, medium and\nlarge storms? Are different physical processes operating?\nAnalysis based upon the size of storms would avoid the\nmixing of data that occurs when storms of all sizes are\nanalyzed.\n6. Summary\n[60] To summarize, we make the following conclusions\nregarding bulk plasma properties at geosynchronous orbit:\n[61] 1. The hot electron and hot ion densities in the\nplasma sheet are highest for the highest values of Kp and\nDst and peaks are present in the evening sector and the\npostdawn sector, the latter being slightly larger. The plasma\nsheet density, temperature, and related quantities all strongly\ncorrelate with the strength of the convection and the\nstrength of the ring current. The presence of plasma sheet\nmaterial at geosynchronous orbit during storms is correlated\nwith the phase of the storm.\n[62] 2. Plasma sheet material is delivered to the inner\nmagnetosphere immediately following the commencement\nof storms, during times of positive Dst. This implies a\ndeeper penetration of the plasma sheet immediately after a\nsudden storm impulse.\n[63] 3. The plasma sheet electron density in the energy\nrange 30 eV to \u000145 keV increases with increasing magne-\ntospheric convection and increasing solar activity. The hot\nelectron density may be 100% greater at solar maximum\nthan at solar minimum.\n[64] 4. The density ratio of plasma sheet O+ to H+,\ninferred from MPA measurements, is highly correlated with\nthe strength of convection and the period in the solar cycle.\nThe O+\/H+ density ratio increases with increasing solar\nactivity and convection strength. The O+ contribution to\nthe overall density may approach 50% during solar maxi-\nmum for periods of high magnetospheric convection.\n[65] Acknowledgments.
