INTRODUCTION \nThis paper presents a comprehensive d scription of the work \ncarried out as part of the on-going GUIDE project. The aim of the \nproject has been to investigate he many issues and challenges that \narise from the development and actual deployment of a context- \naware [14] [2] electronic tourist guide in a practical real-world \nenvironment, i.e. the city of Lancaster. Since starting work on the \nproject, we have enjoyed a great deal of collaborative support \nfrom the city's Tourist Information Centre (TIC) and also \ncooperation from Lancaster's City Council. This support has been \ncrucial in enabling us to successfully build, deploy and evaluate \nthe system. \nVisitors to our city can access context-aware information and \nservices using their hand-held GUIDE units.

GUIDE can be considered as a sophisticated \nexample of a Location Based Service (LBS), a class of service \nthat, it is predicted, will have significant market impact over the \ncoming years. \nThe GUIDE system utilises a high-bandwidth, cell-based, wireless \ninfrastructure and this enables us to support interactive services \nand highly dynamic information (including access to the World \nWide Web). In addition, this same network infrastructure provides \nlocation information to the end-systems, thus obviating the need \nfor a separate location system, such as GPS. \nThe approach and focus of the GUIDE project builds upon the \nwork of earlier context-aware tourist guides such as the \nCybergnide project [12]. However, the GUIDE system has been \ndesigned to meet he real requirements of tourists as determined \nby a comprehensive r quirements study [3]. Furthermore, the \nproject has been concerned with addressing the many human \nfactors issues and practical problems that have arisen from our \napproach. \nThe structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows. The \nrelated work section (section two) is followed by a detailed \ndescription of the GUIDE application (section three). In this \nsection we discuss the application's requirements, he chosen end- \nsystem, the user interface and the functionality supported by our \napplication. The next section (section four) details the main \napproaches underpinning our development of GUIDE. More \nspecifically, we describe the design of our information model, the \nGUIDE soRware architecture that processes this information \nmodel, the use of tags for dynamically generating tailored web \npages and the mechanisms employed for disseminating \ninformation. Next, section five describes the implications of \ndisconnected operation. Our evaluation of GUIDE is described in \nsection six while section seven points to areas of future work. \nFinally, in section eight, we present some concluding remarks. \n2. RELATED WORK \nOur work on the context-aware GUIDE system is clearly related \nto the work at Xerox PARC on the location-aware PARCTab [16] \nsystem. This system utilised the Olivetti Active Badge \ninfrastructure [15] for obtaining positioning information and also \nfor the transmission of data, such as e-mail, to the user's \nPARCTab. The positioning information sensed by the system was \nused to trigger certain events, such as notifying the user to collect \na document when walking past he printer oom. \n20 \nThe RADAR project [1] is conducting related, and more \nsophisticated, research into how the RF network itself can be used \nin order to locate and track users within a building with a view to \nsupporting location-aware services and applications. In more \ndetail, the system processes ignal strength information atmultiple \nbase stations in order to estimate user location with a high degree \nof accuracy, i.e. with a location resolution in the range of 2 to 3 \nmetres. \nThe Cyberguide system developed by the Future Computing \nEnvironments (FCE) group at the Georgia Institute of Technology \nis a classic example of a location-aware system. The initial \nCyberguide system [12] used wireless transmissions to detect a \ntourist's position and orientation using a collection of IR beacons. \nThese beacons transmitted unique IDs that could then be \ntranslated into a map location and orientation. The outdoor \nversion of the system utilised Global Positioning System (GPS) \ndata directly. The fact that mapping information (for the small \narea covered) was stored locally allowed the system to offer \ntouring functionality even when disconnected from the network. \nAlso related to the work on GUIDE is the FCE group's \nConference Assistant application [6]. This application has been \ndesigned to support conference attendees by providing them with \nappropriate context-aware information and collaborative tools via \na PDA as they navigate conference rooms. The conference \nassistant was developed using a distributed architecture that relies \non RF based wireless connectivity and location sensors in order to \ncommunicate changes in context between the various components \nof the architecture. \nClosely related work in the area of intelligent electronic tourist \nguides is currently being conducted as part of the HIPS (Hyper- \nInteraction within Physical Space) project [10]. In common with \nGUIDE, HIPS is also investigating the use of wireless \ntechnologies and adaptive hypermedia to provide up-to-date \ncontext-aware information to tourists and the implications for \nhuman factors issues that arise from this approach. \nThe 'OnTheMove' project has developed a 'City Guide' \napplication [11] designed to utilise either WaveLAN or GSM \nbased connectivity. In common with GUIDE the position of the \nWaveLAN base station can be used to provide a fix on location. \nHowever, the OnTheMove system can also gain a location fix \nusing GPS, if sufficient satellites are in view. The application uses \nchanges in location in order to trigger the appropriate map to be \ndownloaded and displayed. \nIt is worth noting that a number of other prototype network-based \ntourist guide systems currently exist. However, these systems are \ncharacterised by only having access to low-bandwidth wireless \ncommunications or using resource poor end-systems. \nFurthermore, such systems focus only on the presentation of\nlocation aware information and do not attempt o provide users \nwith information and functionality hat is tailored to the wider \nenvironmental context (e.g. the opening times of attractions and \nthe most aesthetic routes between them) and the personal \npreferences of the visitor. \n3. THE GUIDE APPLICATION \n3.1 Application Requirements \nWe gathered an initial set of requirements for GUIDE from a \nseries of semi-structured, one-to-one interviews with members of \nstaff at our city's TIC. In addition, several days were spent at the \nTIC observing the information eeds of visitors. During this \nperiod, the following four key requirements were identified. \n3.1.1 Flexibility \nThe system was required to have sufficient flexibility to enable \nvisitors to explore, and learn about, a city in their own way. This \nrequirement was based on the observation that some visitors \nprefer to play a passive role when exploring a new city, e.g. \nfollowing a guided tour; while others may choose a more active \nrole by using guidebooks or street maps. It was deemed important \nthat visitors would be able to control their pace of interaction with \nthe system, e.g. being able to interrupt a tour in order to take a \ncoffee break. \n3.1.2 Context-Aware Information \nThe information presented to visitors by the system should be \ntailored to their context. We identified two broad classes of \ncontext to be used, namely: personal and environmental. \nExamples of personal context include: the visitor's interests, e.g. \nhistory, or architecture, the visitor's current location, attractions \nalready visited and any refreshment preferences they might have. \nExamples of environmental context include: the time of day, and \nthe opening times of attractions. \n3.1.3 Support For Dynamic Information \nDuring the requirements capture we identified a significant need \nto support dynamic information. Examples of dynamic \ninformation range from changes to the normal opening\/closing \ntimes of attractions to the daily specials menu of the city's cafrs. \nSuch information eeds to be made available to visitors when \nappropriate. \n3.1.4 Support for Interactive Services \nStudying tourist activities in our city revealed that visitors often \nmake repeated visits back to the TIC, often during the course of a \nsingle day. In most cases this is because they need to make use of \na service offered by the TIC, most commonly the booking of \naccommodation r travel. We therefore identified a requirement to \nprovide visitors with remote access to interactive services in order \nto reduce the need for visits back to the TIC. \n3.2 The GUIDE End-System \nIn close consultation with the TIC, we considered a wide range of \ndevices for use as the GUIDE end-system. In particular, we \nconsidered pen-based tablet PCs, such as the Fujitsu Stylistic and \nTeamPad, Windows CE based machines, such as the Casio \nCassiopeia, and other PDAs such as the Apple Newton. After \nmuch deliberation, we chose to use the transflective rsion of the \nFujitsu TeamPad 7600 [8] as the GUIDE end-system (as \nillustrated running the GUIDE application i figure 1). \n21 \nFigure 1: The GUIDE end-system. \nOur main reasons for choosing the TeamPad over the models are \nlisted below. \n1. The TeamPad has a transflective screen that \nenables the unit's display to be readable ven in \ndirect sunlight. Furthermore, the display is of \nsufficient size, resolution (800 by 600) and colour \ndepth (8 bit greyscale) to present extual and \ngraphical information, such as maps, with the \nrequired clarity. Consequently, visitors can have a \nsignificantly richer browsing experience than that \nwhich would be afforded by smaller displays, such \nas those founds on PDAs. \n2. Despite its relatively large screen size the unit is \nsufficiently light to hold with one hand for an \nextended period of time. \n3. The TeamPad is based around a Pentium 166 \nMMX processor and therefore has sufficient power \nto run java based applications with reasonable \nperformance. The interactive nature of the system \nmakes the performance issue one of crucial \nimportance. For example, unlike other network- \nbased tourist guide systems, GUIDE utilises local \nprocessing power to provide visitors with \ndynamically tailored tours of the city (section \n3.4.2). However, the algorithm to create a tour is \ncomputationally intensive and the longer the time \ntaken to generate a tour the greater the likelihood \nof the visitor becoming frustrated. We found that \nthe performance of the CE based machines \navailable at the time (late 1997) was very \ndisappointing, even for rendering simple web \npages. \n4. The TeamPad can run the Microsoft Windows 95 \noperating system and hence all of the development \nkits and drivers associated with this operating \nsystem were available. At the time, the Apple \nNewton and CE based machines did not have the \nrequired driver support, i.e. drivers for appropriate \nPCMCIA based wireless networking cards. \nThe TeamPad measures 213x153x15mm, and weighs a very \nreasonable 850g. We have found the unit to have a battery life of \napproximately two hours (when driving a wireless networking \ncard in mainly receive mode) and to be relatively resistant to \nrough treatment. \n3.3 The User Interface to GUIDE \nThe user interface to GUIDE (as illustrated in :figure 2) is based \naround a modified browser metaphor. This decision was made for \ntwo reasons. Firstly, the metaphor matches closely the kind of \ninformation that had to be modelled, i.e. the notion of following \nhypertext links in order to access greater levels of detailed \ninformation about a particular attraction or event in the city. \nThe second reason for adopting the browser metaphor was based \non the growing acceptance of the web and the increasing \nfamiliarity of the metaphor as a tool for interaction. We hoped that \npositive transfer from the use of common web browsers would \nhelp make the system both easy to use and easy to learn for users \nwith previous web experience. However, we also wanted to \nascertain the extent to which the basic metaphor would be \nappropriate for the task of supporting the additional context-aware \nbased functionality required by GUIDE. More specifically, we \nwanted to investigate the extent to which differences and \ninconsistencies with the standard would prove confusing to users. \nKc~ieat lm \" : Boe lana~ .. . . .  . \nWelcome to Lancaster Kelth \nThanks for choosing me as your Gulde to Lancaster.

This \ndecision was based on the observation [13] that, in general, \nnovice users will find a computer-based interactive system more \napproachable if it is perceived as having a polite and friendly \npersonality. However, as users become more expert with using the \nsystem then this approach may become less appropriate. \nWe did consider using a multimodal user interface, e.g. one in \nwhich information and navigation i structions could be delivered \nto the user using speech output. However, following discussions \nwith staff at the city's TIC, we decided not to pursue the \napproach, at least in the development of the first prototype. Our \nmain reservation was based on the fact that GUIDE is designed \nfor outdoor pedestrian use and our city has its fair share of traffic \nnoise. We were concerned that visitors might be distracted when \ncrossing roads if the system chose that time to deliver some \ninformation. Following on from this point, in general we have \nreservations about the effective bandwidth of voice for \ninformation transfer and the extent o which users can control the \npace of information delivery with a speech-based system. \n22 \n3.4 Application Functionality \nThe GUIDE system provides city visitors with a wide range of \nfunctionality: a visitor can use their GUIDE unit to access \ncontext-aware information, create a tailored tour of the city, \naccess interactive services, and send and receive textual messages. \n3.4.1 Access Context-Aware Information \nThe visitor can use GUIDE to retrieve web-based information \nbased on the current context, e.g. the visitor's location. In \naddition, the system also enables visitors to access web pages in a \nnon context-aware manner. More specifically, by following the \nappropriate links visitors have general access to the World Wide \nWeb. \nIn order to retrieve information the visitor can tap the 'Info' \nbutton and this will cause a set of choices to be presented in the \nform of hypertext links. Figure 3 shows the choices that would be \navailable if the visitor happened to be located in the cell \nsurrounding the tourist information centre. \nIt is important o note that not all the options are based on the \nvisitor's current location. For example, the visitor is provided \nwith the ability to search for information using a keyword search \nfacility, irrespective of their current location. \nI L'~ ,,T~ . . . . . . .  ~m.=]=m ~.m~wh. .=-  ........... r~ . . . . . .

During an \nexpert walkthrough of the system (section 6.1) it became apparent \nthat constraining the visitor's access to information based on their \nlocation can be very frustrating for the visitor if the information \nthey require cannot be accessed because we did not deem it to be \nof sufficient relevance to the area concerned. \nOn a more general point, our experience with this aspect of the \nsystem has taught us that designers of context-aware systems must \nnot be over zealous when deciding to constrain the information or \nfunctionality provided by the system based on the current context. \nThe difficulty of pre-empting the user's goal is further highlighted \nwhen considering the situation where the visitor selects the third \noption in order to view a list of nearby attractions. When \npresented to the visitor, the list is sorted in such a way that those \nattractions that are open, and have not already been visited, are \nplaced higher up the list. The assumption is made that the visitor \nis more likely to be interested in attractions that are open and that \nhave not already been visited. An earlier version of the system \nconstrained the output by removing all closed attractions from the \npresented list. However, this frustrated some visitors who were \ninterested in visiting the attraction anyway, e.g. to view the \narchitecture of a building. \n3.4.2 Create a Tailored Tour of  the City \nThe GUIDE system is designed to enable visitors to request a \nstructured tour of Lancaster based on a set of attractions that they \nwish to visit. In order to ascertain this set of attractions, visitors \nare asked to select attractions from a set of categories uch as \n'Historic' and 'Recreation'. However, one of the problems with \nasking the visitor to choose attractions to be included in their tour \nis that they do not necessarily appreciate what is special in a given \ntown. For example, everyone would like to drink stout when in \nDublin even though they might not do so at home. For this reason, \nwe also provide a 'Popular Attractions' category. \nF . . . . . . . . . .  t . . . . . . . . . .  ~ ' ' t \n_N \n~ 1 am leading you towards the John of Gaunt Gateway to Lancaster CaIUa.

I \nFigure 4: The presentation of navigation information. \nOnce a tour has been generated, the visitor is presented with a \nrecommended sequence for visiting their chosen attractions. The \nvisitor can then, either, agree to be taken to the next attraction in \nthe suggested sequence, or, override this recommendation by \nselecting a different attraction to be their current destination. The \nsystem provides this choice in order to prevent the system \nbehaving in an overly authoritarian manner. It does, after all, seem \nquite reasonable to allow a visitor to delay their current our and \nget directions to the nearest caf6 instead. However, providing this \nlevel of flexibility involved a significant increase in interface \ncomplexity and this part proved most difficult to visitors (see \nevaluation results). \nA structured tour is broken down into a number of distinct steps \nor stages. Once a visitor has completed one stage, they can request \nthe system to describe the next stage of the tour by touching the \n'show next instruction' button. Stages in the tour are described \nusing a navigation instruction. These instructions provide the \nvisitor with a piece of text explaining, in some detail, how to get \nfrom their current location to the next attraction in the tour (see \nfigure 4). In addition, the visitor is also presented with \n23 \nGUIDE web \nI~UIDE c~ s~er \nI \nFigure 5: The cell-based wireless communications infrastructure used by GUIDE. \ninformation on their current location and this may include one or \nmore hypertext links should the visitor wish to find out further \n:information. \nlit is important to note that, given the same set of attractions, the \nordering of the tour recommended by the system can actually \nchange dynamically. This can occur when, for example, a visitor \nstays at a location longer than anticipated or if one of the \nattractions announces that it will close early. The system regularly \ncalculates whether or not the current order for visiting the \nremaining attractions i appropriate given current time constraints. \n3.4.3 Access Interactive Services \nBy providing remote access to interactive services, such as the \nbooking of hotel accommodation, visitors can save time by \nmaking bookings via their GUIDE unit. In addition to providing \nremote access to those services provided by the TIC, the GUIDE \nsystem also enables access to other services, such as enabling \nvisitors to query those films on show at the city's cinema and \nenabling visitors to book seats at the cinema remotely. \n3.4.4 Send and Receive Messages \nThis messaging service enables groups of visitors, who may have \nseparated in order to visit different attractions in the city, to keep \nin touch and also enables visitors to request information from staff \nat the TIC. \n4. ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH \nWhen engineering the GUIDE system we wanted to explore how \nthe use of a high-bandwidth cell-based wireless networking \ninfrastructure could be used to disseminate dynamic information \nto handheld GUIDE units. In particular, we required an \ninfrastructure capable of enabling GUIDE units to achieve high- \nspeed access to general web resources, including graphically \nintensive web pages. We also wanted to explore how the cell- \nbased nature of the network could be used to provide GUIDE \nunits with positioning information. Details of this wireless \nnetwork, the caching strategies used and our overall model for \nrepresenting context-sensitive nformation are described in detail \nin the following sections. \n4.1 The Cell-based Communications \nInfrastructure \nThe network infrastructure that is used by the GUIDE system \ncomprises a number of interconnected cells as illustrated in figure \n5. \nThe wireless network is based on Lucent Technolgies' 802.11 \ncompliant WaveLAN system. The version used by GUIDE \noperates in the 2.4GHz band and offers a maximum bandwidth of \n2 Mbps per cell. Currently, six communication cells have been \ndeployed within a region of the city that is popular with tourists. \nA single Linux-based cell-server is associated with each cell and \nthis server is responsible for broadcasting information to GUIDE \nunits as they enter the cell-server's zone of coverage. Each cell- \nserver has two network interfaces. The first interface is used as a \nlink back to the university network. In some cases, cell-servers \nwere installed at locations where the university already holds \nleased lines. In buildings owned by the City Council we have \ninstalled BT Keyline links, these are based on Symmetric DSL \ntechnology and effectively provide a two-way 2 Mbit leased line. \nIn the near future, we plan to extend the communications \ninfrastructure (currently comprising 6 cells) with additional cells. \nHowever, some of these cells will require the placement of cell- \nservers in buildings where the installation of leased-lines i\ninappropriate. Within these buildings, we intend to obtain a link \nback to the university isprovided by the EDNET wireless network \n[7] which has been installed to provide internet access to local \nschools. \nAlthough, the range of WaveLAN is approximately 200m in free \nspace, WaveLAN signals have very poor propagation \ncharacteristics through buildings and, therefore, by the strategic \npositioning of cell-servers, we have been able to create relatively \nsmall and asymmetric cells. Within the context of GUIDE this is a \npositive feature because by creating smaller, non-overlapping \ncells more accurate positioning information can be provided. For \nexample, in Lancaster we have been able to create a \ncommunications cell for the TIC, which covers the immediate area \nsurrounding the TIC but does not (by a small number of metres) \ncrossover into the cell associated with the nearby city castle. \nIndeed, the TIC cell has a coverage area that resembles the shape \nof a squashed rectangle rather than that of a circle and at its \n24 \n~ , ~  Object References ~ \n.i .\/ \\ \\ \nLocation Objects \\ \"~ ,~ j \nPage Reference \/ ~ \\  \nFigure 6: The GUIDE information model. \nnarrowest point, measures only 15m across. In order to manage \nthe strategic positioning of cells, it was necessary to repeatedly \nplace the WaveLAN antenna t different heights and positions and \nthen use the test software supplied by Lucent technologies to \ndetermine how the range of the cell had been affected. \nAn additional benefit of producing small non-overlapping cells is \nthat it enables us to disable WaveLAN roaming. Had roaming \nbeen enabled then additional and unwanted network traffic would \nhave resulted to support handover as units moved between \nWaveLAN cells. By disabling the roaming facility, GUIDE units \nare effectively silent on the network unless they request \ninformation that is not on the current broadcast cycle [ 12]. \nHowever, in many cases, we have not found it possible to create \nvery accurate cell boundaries due to the reflection of signals, \ninterference and changes in propagation patterns resulting from \nfluctuations in the density and placement of objects within the \ncell. For example, where we have placed a cell for one of \nLancaster's public squares, the degree of propagation down the \nsquare's access roads varies with the prevailing conditions. \n4.2 Design of an Information Model \nThe information model adopted by GUIDE was required to \nrepresent or store the following four distinct ypes of information: \n1. information which can be tailored to reflect the \ncurrent context. More specifically, this is often \nmodelled as information that can react to events \nsuch as 'it is raining' and 'the user is outside the \ncastle and has an interest in history'. \n2. geographic information, which can be either \nexpressed in geographic terms (e.g. 'location a is at \nco-ordinates x,y') or symbolic terms (e.g. 'the \ncottage museum is in the castle hill area'). \n3. hypertext information, which can be either global \n(i.e. internet based) such as the world-wide-web or\nstored locally. \n4. active components, which are capable of storing \nstate (such as a visitor's preferences) and of \nperforming specific actions or satisfying certain \nrequests. \nAlthough each particular information type has been successfully \nmodelled, no models could be found that were capable of \nhandling the full complement of information types described \nabove [5]. In more detail, data models for supporting context- \nsensitive information such as stick-e-notes [2], are not well suited \nfor managing geographic information such as proximity \nrelationships. Similarly, the data models upported by the current \nrange of object oriented Geographic Information Systems are ill- \nsuited for representing context-sensitive nformation [4] because \nthey lack the necessary triggering mechanisms required for \nhandling the events raised by changes of context. \nThe lack of availability of an appropriate model provided the \nmotivation for developing our own information model (figure 6). \nThis model is based on the integration of an active object model \nwith a hypertext information model. \nThe information model contains two distinct object types: \nnavigation point objects and location objects. Navigation point \nobjects represent waypoints between location objects are used to \nsupport he construction of tour guides. Alternatively, location \nobjects actually represent attractions in the city and are the \nfundamental building block of our model. One example of a \nlocation object is the castle. This object would have state \nrepresenting its physical ocation within the city, opening times, \nand links to other nearby locations. Location objects also support \nmethods to enable state information to be accessed and modified. \nFor example, two of the methods supported by the object \nrepresenting the castle would be: \nGetlmmediateNeighboursO \nThis method returns a list of object references for those objects \nthat are immediate neighbours of the current object and is \ntherefore useful when performing navigation tasks. \nProvideDescription 0 \nThis method is used to retum a handle to information about the \nlocation object based on the visitor's profile. For example, if the \n25 \nvisitor required information i  German then this method would \nreturn a handle to information on the castle presented in German. \nThis provides coarse-grained tailoring of the information \naccording to user profiles. The fine-grained tailoring of \ninformation is achieved using tags as described later in this \nsection. \nThe information model allows geographical information to be \nrepresented by creating relationships (modelled as objects) \nbetween navigation point and location objects. These \nrelationships can have attributes (weights) a signed to them to \ndenote, for example, the distance between two objects by a variety \nof means of transport. Using this representation, other objects can \ntraverse the object graph in order to determine, for example, \nneighbouring locations or optimal routes between points\u2022 \nThe information model was populated to represent hose \nattractions and shops that are in approximately the same region as \nthat covered by the cell-based communications i frastructure and \nthis involved the creation of 400 object instances. This set of \nobjects comprises 120 location\/navigation p int objects and 280 \nrelationship objects. The current approach adopted by GUIDE is \nto store all such objects belonging to the information model on the \nlocal client and this requires approximately 300 Kbytes of storage. \nThis technique nables GUIDE units to perform route guidance \ncalculations, irrespective of whether or not network connectivity \nis available. \nAlthough GUIDE units are able to cache parts of the information \nmodel ocally, due to the dynamic nature of the information and \nthe potential storage requirements a sociated with storing the \nmodel in its entirety, simply caching the model at the local client \nis not an appropriate solution. In the GUIDE system, the \ncommunications i frastructure is used to disseminate he latest \nversion of the information model to GUIDE units [5]. This is \nachieved using a broadcast based approach [8]. In more detail, \nunits listen on a well-known multicast IP address for those parts \nof the information model currently being transmitted in the \nbroadcast cycle. In this way, units entering a cell receive (and \nlocally cache) pages related to the cell. \nIt is important o note that the information model and the \ncommunications infrastructure are independent. Indeed, in the \nnear future we plan to install a new communications cell to cover \nthe Lancaster Priory but this will not require any amendment to \nthe information model. \nIn order to allow hypertext pages to reference the object model we \nenable the authors of hypertext pages to augment their pages with \ntags that control the display of the information (see examples \nbelow). These tags take the form of special instructions that are \nable to query the GUIDE object model. For example a tag might \nbe used customise a page to include a tourists name or their \nlocation. \nA selection of the tags currently supported and in use by GUIDE \nare described below: \n<GUIDETAG INSERT POSITION> \nThis tag can be used to insert a tourist's location dynamically into \nthe page being displayed. So, if a tourist followed a link and \nasked 'tell me about he area that I am in' the resulting page could \ninclude this tag to inform the visitor of their location. \n<GUIDETAG INTEREST ((HISTORY > 50) AND \n(ARCHITECTURE > 50)) \nThis tag allows a user's profile to be queried and thus enables the \napplication to ailor pages based on the preferences of the visitor. \n<GUIDETAG INSERT NEIGBOURS> \nThis tag can be used to generate information relating to nearby \nattractions dynamically as illustrated in the following example. An \nexample of a page containing this tag (removing the unnecessary \nHTML META information) is illustrated in figure 7. \n<HTML> \n<P><B><FONT SIZE=\"5\" FACE=\"Comic Sans \nMS\">The following attractions are near to you \nnow.<IF ONT><IB><IP> \n<P><FONT FACE=\"Comic Sans MS\">Note: The \nlist below is ordered according to closeness and \nwhether or not they are open or \nclosed.<\/FONT><\/P> \n<P><FONT FACE=\"Comic Sans MS\"><BR> \n<GUIDETAG INSERT NEIGHBOURS> \n<\/FONT><\/P> \n<\/HTML> \nFigure 7: Example of page containing GUIDE tags. \nOnce this page has been retrieved from the cache (locally from the \nclient) or from the remote proxy it can be processed by the \nappropriate software filter causing the GUIDE tag to be replaced \nwith the appropriate HTML code. Considering the example of \nfigure 7 (and given the visitor's location being near the city's \nTIC) the processed page would be displayed as shown in figure 8. \nThe  following attn~ctlons me new to you  now. \nNote: The list bel~ is orclemd according to \u00a2loseness and ~hether onot hw are open or closed. \ni John O'Gaunt Gateway \nThe C~aoe Museum ~j \ni Curreot~y~\u00a2elvingtocatloil updatl~8. \". ; ; I ~  ~ , ~ ~ . . . . .  ; - - -  ~ ~ ~ ' ~  . . . .  \nFigure 8: The dynamically created 'nearby places' page. \nThe effort required for populating the information model with \ninformation for a given city should not be underestimated. Indeed, \nnearly eight person months of time was invested in populating the \ninformation model with the 400 objects and approximately 400 \nHTML pages required to represent just part of the city. Without \nthis investment in time, the field trial of the system by visitors to \n26 \n\u2022% Local \n@.G.G \nFigure 9: The GUIDE \nthe city (described in section 6.2) would have lacked much of its \nvalidity. To help simplify the process of creating location and \nnavigation objects we developed a 'city editor' application. This \napplication provides designers with a very useful graphical tool \nfor automatically creating and customising location and \nnavigation objects for a given city. In addition, by associating arcs \nbetween objects represented asnodes, designers can stipulate the \ngeographic relationships between location and navigation objects. \nIn this respect, the GUIDE information model has a high level of \nportability for mapping onto different cities. \n4.3 The  GUIDE Sof tware  Arch i tec ture  \nVisitors interact with their GUIDE units through their own local \nweb browser embedded within the GUIDE application. In effect, \nall HTTP requests are processed by a local web proxy, which may \ninteract with other objects in order to service the request. The \nobjects that constitute the GUIDE software architecture are \nillustrated in figure 9. \nThe key component in our architecture is the client agent object. \nThis object services user requests for information and dispatches \nevents, e.g. position updates, to the appropriate components in the \nsystem. The client agent also creates location and navigation \nobjects and maintains handles to currently active location and \nnavigation objects (in a similar fashion to a CORBA ORB in a \ndistributed application). \nThe following six steps illustrate the interaction of the various \nobjects when reacting to a change in the visitor's current location. \nStep 1) The position sensor object listens for beacons \nfrom cell servers. \nStep 2) On hearing a beacon the position sensor \nobject notifies the client agent of the visitor's \nnew location e.g. the city's castle. \nStep 3) The client agent searches through the objects \ncurrently in memory to determine whether or \nnot an instance of the appropriate location \nRemote G oG \nsoftware architecture. \nobject already exists. If it does, then a handle \nto that object is returned, otherwise a new \ninstance of the object is instantiated. \nStep 4) On receiving a handle to the landmark object, \nthe client agent can invoke methods on the \nlandmark. Initially, the client agent invokes a \nmethod to return the nearby attractions. For \nreasons of performance, these objects (which \nare the most likely objects to be used) are \nloaded in main memory. \nStep 5) The visitor can then use their web browser to \nrequest information such as, 'What attractions \nare nearby ?'. \nStep6) The local proxy object processes such \nrequests by fetching an appropriate page of \ninformation from either: the local cache, the \nremote cache or the central web server. The \nfilter object would process or tailor this page \nby interrogating other components such as the \nvisitor's profile. \nIn the current GUIDE system, the application loads all objects \nwhen the application is initialised. The objects are then passed to \nthe PathFinder object (see figure 9) that is responsible for \ngenerating a model of the city from the objects. \n5. THE IMPL ICAT IONS OF  \nD ISCONNECTED OPERATION \nOne can argue that, in the future, fully connected environments \nwill be commonplace in outdoor as well as indoor environments. \nHowever, it seems unlikely that the problem of excessive power \nconsumption, caused by fully connected operation, will disappear \nin the near future. For this reason, it is dangerous to simply \nassume that one can ignore the problems of connectivity when \nconsidering the future role of mobile context-aware systems. \n27  \nThe GUIDE end-system can become disconnected for significant \nperiods of time. During these periods, GUIDE units are unable to \nreceive static information that is not in the local cache, dynamic \ninformation or location beacons. Consequently, during periods of \ndisconnection, the system must rely on those parts of the \ninformation model that are cached locally. In addition, certain \naspects of GUIDE's functionality are no longer available, e.g. the \nmessaging service and access to interactive s rvices, such as ticket \nbooking. \n5.1 Providing Awareness Information \nOne approach for dealing with the potential for disconnected \noperation would have been to hide the issue of connectivity from \nthe user completely. Given this approach, only when the visitor \nperformed some action that explicitly required connectivity, such \nas booking a cinema ticket, would the visitor be informed that the \nservice was currently unavailable. The problem withthis approach \nis that the behaviour of the system would seem unpredictable and \ninconsistent as the unit switched between connected and \ndisconnected modes of operation. To help alleviate this problem, \nthe user interface to GUIDE has been designed to encourage the \nuser to form a suitable mental model of the system, i.e. one in \nwhich the functionality of the system is not static but dependent \non whether or not wireless connectivity is currently available. The \nfollowing subsections describe the various user interface design \nchoices we have made in order to enable the user to realise which \nmode they are currently in. \n5.1.1 Use of a Metaphor to Provide Connectivity \nFeedback \nA familiar metaphor was required for providing visitors with \nfeedback regarding the state of connectivity and encouraging them \nto associate this with available functionality. To arrive at a \nsuitable metaphor, we considered how connectivity feedback is \nprovided on mobile phones. The user of a mobile phone is given \nfeedback of their connectivity in the form of 'bars of connectivity' \nand when a user receives no bars of connectivity they expect \nlimited functionality, i.e. the inability to send or receive calls. \nThe 'bars of connectivity' metaphor has thus been incorporated \ninto the user interface as shown in figures 2,3,4,8 and 10. \nIn the current GUIDE system, although the metaphor is based on \nthe familiar five bars of connectivity, the system only uses the \nmetaphor to display one of two states, i.e. ither all bars or no \nbars. The system determines which of the two states should be \ndisplayed based upon whether or not it is receiving location \nbeacons at the expected frequency. During end-user t ials (section \n6) it was found that the slight liberties taken with the metaphor \ndid not invalidate its desired function, i.e. as a simple means for \ncommunicating the availability of network connectivity o a non- \ntechnical member of the general public. \n5.1.2 Showing the Status of Location Updates \nUp-to-date positioning information is not available when GUIDE \nunits are disconnected from the network. For this reason, we have \nincorporated a location status window into the user interface (as \nshown in figures 2,3,4,8 and 10) in order to keep the user \ninformed of the ongoing reception of location information by the \nsystem. When location information has not been received for a \nwhile, the visitor is shown the time (in whole minutes) that has \nelapsed since the last location update was received. It is important \nto note that even if the GUIDE system utilised a GPS system for \nobtaining positioning i formation, there would still exist periods \nwhen location information would not be available. This is often \nthe case when using GPS in a city environment because the \nposition of tall buildings can prevent he GPS system from \n'seeing' a sufficient number of satellites to obtain a fix on \nlocation. \n5.2 Using the Visitor's Assistance to Solve \nLocation Problems \nWhen visitors do leave cell coverage and up-to-date positioning \ninformation becomes unavailable, the GUIDE system tries to \nlocate the visitor by establishing a form of partnership between \nitself and the visitor. In more detail, the visitor is shown a series \nof thumbnail pictures showing attractions in the vicinity of the \nvisitor's last known location (see figure 10). Providing the visitor \nis then able to recognise and select one of the pictures, the \nGUIDE system to once again ascertain the visitor's location \nwithin the city. \nDuring our initial evaluation of the system we have found the \nresponse of users to selecting their position based on a picture \nthumbnail to be positive. \nI.~ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  it~l Xl i \n__~_~_~ _,,k . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  ~-  .................................... -i \nClick on le  image below that best describes your Iocabon now. \nL . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  2 iS_ l _ .

THE EVALUATION OF GUIDE \nOur evaluation of the GUIDE system involved two distinct \nphases: an expert walkthrough of the system and a field trial. This \nsection summarises the results of these evaluation phases. A more \ndetailed iscussion of the evaluation and its results can be found \nin [3]. \n6.1 Expert Walkthrough \nAn expert walkthrough of the GUIDE system was performed in \norder to provide a crude first pass evaluation of the system's \nusability. The walkthroughs involved four experts, with \nbackgrounds panning user-centered esign and computer \nsupported learning. Experts were asked to use a talk-aloud \nprotocol while using the system and were then interviewed and \nasked to criticize the system. Examples of problems that were \nidentified and fixed for the field trial included the need for button \n28 \nAge Profile \nTable 1: Profiles of visitors involved in the evaluation. \nNumber Gender Previous Web \nExperience \nMale Female \n10-20 6 4 2 6 \n21-35 15 7 8 \n36-55 26 12 14 \n56-70 13 6 7 \nlayout o be consistent with that of other browsers and the need to \nprovide animated feedback to signify when a page is \ndownloading. \n6.2 Field Trial \nThe main objective of our evaluation at this stage of the project \nwas to validate and refine our initial set of requirements against a\nset of end-users. In addition, we wanted to know whether or not \npeople were prepared to accept the use of a computer-based \ncontext-aware tourist guide. Consequently, we wanted to measure \nthe quality of the visitors experience [ 10] as opposed to absolute \nperformance times for accessing specific pieces of information. \nThe evaluation of the GUIDE prototype by field trial was subject \nto a number of constraints. In particular, we felt acutely aware that \nwe would be impinging on the leisure time of tourists. For this \nreason, we asked visitors to use the system as they wished and for \nonly as long as they felt happy, rather than performing some \npredefined series of tasks. \nOur method for evaluation was based on direct observation, with \nvisitors encouraged to use a talk-aloud protocol for audio \nrecording. In addition, we maintained a time-stamped log of \nuser's interaction with the system in order to gather a record of \nthe number of links followed. Following each test, a semi- \nstructured interview as performed in order to obtain the visitor's \nsubjective opinion of the system. We felt that this approach was \nsuitable given the main objective of the evaluation. More \nspecifically, by shadowing users we could observe those parts of \nthe interface that caused problems while the semi-structured \ninterviews enabled us to follow up on any problems encountered \nduring the trial. \nOver a period of approximately four weeks we had 60 people \nvolunteer to use the system. Roughly half of these volunteers were \ncanvassed near the city's castle while the other half answered to \nadverts to come and trial the system. These adverts were places on \nposters around the city and also on local radio. The makeup of the \nvolunteers in terms of age, gender, web-experience etc. is shown \nin table 1. \nThe results of the evaluation that we found most interesting are \nlisted below: \n1. All visitors expressed the opinion that he location- \naware navigation and information retrieval \nmechanisms provided by the system were both \nuseful and reassuring, and stated that they enjoyed \nusing GUIDE to explore the city. \n2. The vast majority of visitors said that they were \nprepared to trust the information presented by the \nsystem, including the navigation instructions. A \nnumber of visitors uggested that heir level of trust \nwas not constant but varied with the apparent \naccuracy of the information presented. \n3. Surprisingly, all visitors seemed quite prepared to \nuse a 'computer' as a tool to explore the city. \nSpecifically regarding the teampad, the majority of \nvisitors were basically happy with the dimensions \nand weight of the unit. \n4. The vast majority of visitors without previous web \nexperience felt comfortable using the system to \nfollow a tour and retrieving information by \nnavigating hypertext links after a brief (usually \nabout five-minute) training session. However, a \nnumber of visitors found the flexibility provided by \nthe tour guide facility a little bewildering and we \nintend to make a future version of this facility \nsubstantially simpler to use. \n5. A significant majority of visitors said that they \nwere aware that their GUIDE unit utilized wireless \ncommunications in a similar way to a mobile \nphone and appreciated the relationship between the \ndegree of connectivity and the level of \nfunctionality available at a given point in time. \n6. Analysis of the access logs revealed that visitors in \nthe 10 to 20 age profile seemed to revel in the \ntechnology and visited approximately twice as \nmany links (per minute of usage) as those from \nother age profiles (this does not mean they read \nand assimilated this information of course). \n7. The majority of visitors appreciated that the system \nknew of their location to within a certain area and \nthat this relied upon the reception of location \nupdates. \n29 \n7. CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE \nWORK \nToday, visitors to Lancaster can come into the TIC and ask a \nmember of staff for a GUIDE unit. The visitor will be given a \nshort training session on how to use the system before being asked \nto sign a disclaimer form. Once they have supplied their credit- \ncard details (as means of a deposit) they are allowed to leave the \nTIC with their GUIDE unit to help them explore the city. \nThe TIC are currently in the process of securing funding to \nemploy a full-time member of staff whose main responsibility will \nbe to update information for the GUIDE system. This task will \ninclude duties such as entering the daily specials menu from \nparticipating caf6s and keeping track of any changes to the normal \nopening times of the city's attractions. \nOne of our current directions for developing the GUIDE system is \nto extend the role of connectivity in GUIDE by supplementing the \nexisting GUIDE infrastructure with the latest low-power, micro- \ncellular, wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth. This will enable \nGUIDE to support communications within buildings. In addition, \nthe use of micro-cellular wireless communications systems will \nenable us to determine users' locations with greater accuracy, \nwithout requiring bulky differential GPS equipment, and thus \nenhance the navigational capabilities of the system in particular \nareas of the city. \nIn the near future, we plan to increase the diversity of context- \nsensitive interactive services and to harness the enthusiasm of the \nyounger generation of visitor by developing games and \neducational tools, such as treasure hunts, that can be played using \nGUIDE. In addition we would like to explore the potential for \nmaking parts of the information model 'public', thus providing \nvisitors with the capability to share their experiences and \nrecommendations with other visitors or family members. \nAnother area in which we hope to conduct future research \nconcerns the suitability of existing techniques and methodologies \nfor designing and evaluating context-aware interactive systems \nsuch as GUIDE. In particular, such systems are highly adaptive by \ntheir nature but this clearly conflicts with the design principle of \nensuring predictability within the system. \n8. CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper has described our experiences of developing, \ndeploying and evaluating GUIDE, an electronic ontext-aware \ntourist guide. The development of the system can be considered \nfrom engineering, information and human factors viewpoints. \nConsidering the system from an engineering perspective, we note \nthat the system is built upon a high-bandwidth, cell-based, \nwireless communications i frastructure. This infrastructure has a \ndual role, firstly, it is responsible for broadcasting location \nbeacons in order to provide positioning information, and, \nsecondly, the infrastructure is used to disseminate both static and \ndynamic information to mobile GUIDE units. We found that the \ncell-based granularity of positioning information provided by the \ncommunications i frastructure was sufficient for the requirements \nof the system. The relatively high-bandwidth provided by the \ninfrastructure is very useful for maintaining reasonable download \nspeeds when visitors require access to information held on the \nweb. We found the ability to support interactive services was \nbeneficial to tourists and, furthermore, that the location resolution \nprovided by such an approach was adequate for the application \ndomain. The distributed object-based GUIDE software \narchitecture is responsible for servicing requests for web-based \ninformation and handling contextual events, such as changes in \nthe visitor's location or the opening times of attractions. \nLooking at the system from an information viewpoint, we found it \nnecessary to design our own information model. This model \ncombines the event-based aspects of context-aware models with \nthe geographic functions commonly associated with geographic \ninformation systems (GIS). Crucially, this model is independent \nof the communications infrastructure and enables us to create \nobjects that can respond to events and tailor their behaviour to \nreflect the current context. The information model also provides \naccess points into a collection of web pages whose presentation \ncan be tailored dynamically through the use of special GUIDE \ntags. These tags enable page authors to interrogate the information \nmodel at run-time. GUIDE units are able to cache portions of the \ninformation model locally and this enables visitors to access \ninformation even when outside of communications coverage. In \naddition, the system can request the visitor's assistance inorder to \novercome the lack of location information available when in a \ncommunications cell. The population of the information model \nwith appropriate content was a time consuming task but was \nabsolutely necessary to enable the validation of the system's \ndesign and an evaluation of the systems usability. \nConsidering the system from a human factors perspective, the \nGUIDE system has been designed to meet a set of real end-user \nrequirements. The project has also been concerned with many of \nthe human factors issues that arise from the need to develop auser \ninterface that can successfully cope with the units network \nconnectivity, i.e. switching between connected and disconnected \nmodes of operation. Through our field trial evaluation, we found a \nhigh level of acceptability for the system across a range of \ndifferent ypes of end-user. During the development of GUIDE, \nwe discovered an interesting trade-off, i.e. the need to produce a\nsystem that uses context o simplify the user's understanding of, \nand interaction with, an inherently complex system versus the \nneed not to overly constrain the functionality or information \npresented by the system, based on the current context. This is, of \ncourse, an interesting instance of the fundamental tradeoff \nbetween prescription and freedom. \nAlthough the GUIDE system is publicly available today, we have \nmaintained our links with the TIC and are in the convenient \nposition of having the control to make changes to the GUIDE \nsystem and monitor the results of these changes as part of our on- \ngoing research. We believe that through our work on the GUIDE \nproject we have successfully produced a blueprint for the \ndevelopment of interactive context-aware systems that should be \nof real value to those in the community who wish to develop such \nsystems in a real environment. \n9.
