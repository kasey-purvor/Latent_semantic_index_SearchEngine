The route pur-\nsued by most researchers has been to use numerical optimisation strategies\nin conjunction with FE methods. While these numerical approaches are valu-\nable where a single objective can be defined, they are less useful where there\nare conflicting design objectives (e.g. minimum weight and cost). Furthermore,\nmost numerical optimisation techniques are not as good with discrete variables\n\u2217 Corresponding author.

Here graphical presentation of performance criteria al-\nlows designers to improve their \u201cfeel\u201d for a problem, leading to refinement in\nthe design constraints and further design optimisation. Ashby [2,4] describes\nhow material performance indices (e.g. E\/\u03c1) can help with material selection,\nfor a given design objective such as minimum weight or cost. The selection\nmethod can be facilitated using an \u2019Ashby map\u2019, for example plotting E as a\nfunction of \u03c1. The mapping idea can be extended via multiple selection stages,\nto take into account practical considerations [3]. The methodology developed\nby Ashby for materials selection provides a conceptual framework for selection\nof composite structures. The selection methodology can be used to choose be-\ntween a wide range of variants of the proposed structure, with FE analysis\nproviding the structural performance of the structure. The design selection\nmethodology proposed here is suitable for the early stages of the design pro-\ncess, where the designer considers the widest possible range of solutions that\nwill satisfy the constraints established in the design brief [5,6,12].\nEven when the problem is relatively simple, as with the dogbone case study\ndescribed in this paper, the number of permutations that might be considered\ncan be very large. Particular concerns with design optimisation of composite\nstructures include: a restricted number of ply orientation angles should be\nconsidered; ply numbers must be integer; often (but not always) a balanced\nand symmetric lay-up should be used; several reinforcement regions can be\nincluded. When all these factors are taken into account, along with the need\nto consider different load cases and design objectives, tailoring the geometry,\nmaterial properties and layup of the composite laminate to find an optimum\ndesign is very challenging [6,17,10,11]. The work presented here is an alter-\nnative approach to complex numerical optimisation methods, and is based on\nthe use of 2-D charts to evaluate laminate performance [2,3,17,10,13]. The\npower of the approach lies not only with the simplicity with which lots of\ndata can be visualised, but also the ease with which the designer can interact\nwith the data. This makes it relatively easy to pose \u2019what-if\u2019 questions about\nchanges in the design constraints or objectives and so identify attractive ways\nof re-formulating the problem.\nSection 2 outlines the process of designing with composite materials, the prob-\nlems that the designer faces and the requirements of a selection methodology\nthat can help in the early stages of the design process. In Section 3 we present\ndetails of the selection methodology proposed. We explain the methodology,\ngiving a detail description of the steps to follow. A case study is described in\nSection 4 which illustrates the methodology. Finally, in Section 5 we give a\nconcluding discussion about the methodology presented and we suggest future\nwork to improve the selection methodology.\n2\nMaterials & Design 2007\n2 Designer decisions and selection strategies\nFigure 1 gives an overview of the design process for composite materials. This\nstarts with the market need (what do we need to do and why do we need\nto do it?), followed by a conceptual design (the ideas, possible solutions, ma-\nterials, lay-ups, etc.), preliminary design (sketches, a short list of possible\nsolutions) and detailed design (working drawings, more accurate data, refined\ncost estimates, finite element analysis, coupon tests). The process ends with\nthe development of a prototype, and finally, the production of the design.\nIn the early stages of the design process, the designer has to take key deci-\nsions that will lead to the success or failure of the design. The designer has\nto select appropriate materials from within the materials universe. Where the\ndesigner decides to use composite materials, then further decisions are needed:\nwhich composite to use, which fibres with which resin, which manufacturing\nprocess, dry fabrics or pre-impregnated fabrics (pre-pregs), weaves or unidi-\nrectional fabrics, how many plies and in which orientations? These are some of\nthe variables that the designer can play with in the early stages of the design\nprocess, and making a well-informed decision with so many options can be an\noverwhelming task. Hence any help that the designer can be given in quanti-\nfying these choices at this early stage is invaluable. A well informed decision\nat this stage will reduce the time needed in further design phases and help in\noptimising the final product.\nThe selection methodology presented in this paper is aimed to help the de-\nsigner in this early stage, specifically, when the decision to use unidirectional\npre-preg has been made.\nOne of the requirements set for the methodology was that it should be flexible\nto designer constraints. It was felt important to give the designer freedom\nto impose his\/her constraints, and to change them on-the-fly. For this reason\nnumerical optimisation techniques were avoided, as these do not easily allow\na change in design constraints, without doing another time-consuming \u2019run\u2019.\nFrom all the selection strategies available [4], the one used here is a \u201cfree-\nsearch\u201d strategy based on a quantitative analysis. This has the potential to\nbe a fast, efficient and systematic way of giving innovative solutions. The free-\nsearch quantitative analysis strategy works with a database, which should be\nstructured in a hierarchical way. Normally a pre-stored database is used, but\nin our case thie database is built for each design problem, using FE analysis.\n3\nMaterials & Design 2007\nFig. 1: Overview of the design process, after Ashby\u2019s work [5]\n3 Selection Methodology\nIn this section we give an overview of the methodology and a step-by-step\nguide to the procedure. The following section gives a detailed description of\nhow the methodology is implemented in a simple case study.\n3.1 Overview\nThe basic idea of the methodology is to consider a very wide range of struc-\ntural composite designs, perform appropriate calculations - including FE - to\ndetermine their performance, incorporate the results into a database, work\nwith the data to screen out infeasible solutions or those not meeting the de-\nsign constraints, and finally identify a shortlist of solutions which best meet\nthe design goals. In essence the method builds on Weaver\u2019s methodology for\nlaminate selection [17], but introduces structural analysis into the methodol-\nogy, recognising the way in which structure and laminate lay-up are closely\ncoupled in composites design.\nAshby\u2019s selection method has been implemented in user-friendly software, CES\n[13], which forms the selection \u2019engine\u2019 of the methodology. The CES software\nhas the capability of manipulate the database in a user-friendly way, allowing\nthe user to setup constraints to filter out the information in the database in\norder to make a selection. These constraints can be added via values or directly\n4\nMaterials & Design 2007\nin a graph. What we do is create a database that has all possible solutions to\nthe problem and manipulate\/visualise it in CES. Tables of design configura-\ntions and corresponding performance data are imported into a database within\nthe software. The designer is then able to exploit the interactive capability of\nthe selection software, to impose appropriate design constraints or selection\ncriteria. To facilitate the process, and to help extract trends from the data,\nthe records have been colour coded by laminate lay-up. Various performance\nwindows shows the appropriate performance measures, such as stiffness or\namount of material used. The designer can then use the software to straight-\nforwardly impose constraints and optimise the component. For example, in\nthe case study performance measures of deflection, cost and maximum strain\nenergy are considered to identify a few appropriate lay-ups which fulfil the\ndesign requirements, while minimising use of material.\nAshby\u2019s selection methods and the CES methodology are well known and\ndeveloped, and these have successfully been applied to material and process\nselection in mechanical design. The novelty of the work is to show how the\nselection\u2013optimisation\u2013visualisation tool can be used to meet the special chal-\nlenges of designing with composite materials.\n3.2 Details of methodology\nFigure 2 gives a detailed flowchart of the design methodolgy. The procedure\ncan be divided into six stages, as follows.\nDesign Brief. The design brief sets the framework for the design It gives\nthe \u201cneed\u201d that the product has to satisfy. The design brief has to answer\n(ideally all) the questions; What is the design for? Who is going to use it?\nHow is going to be used? When? Where? How often? etc. The design brief\nhas to give an idea of the batch size which will be produced. The design\nbrief defines the requirements of the design. A simple example of a design\nbrief could be: \u201c Design a \u201chigh-tech\u201d racing bicycle for the British team\nto use in the next Olympic games\u201d. From this design brief we can answer\nwhat do we have to do (a racing bicycle), who is going to use it (athletes),\nwhen and how often is going to be used (Olympic games and world class\ncompetitions), where it is going to be used (velodrome), batch size (between\n10 and 20 bicycles), extra information (has to be very light!).\nDefinition of Problem In this stage it is important to identify clearly the\nconstraints, variables and design objectives [3]. The information gathered\nin the design brief must be translated into quantitative constraints (e.g.\nmaximum weight), variables and design objectives (e.g. minimum cost). We\ncan use the quantify the information obtained for the design brief; using\nthe bicycle example we can say that the load equals 80kg, corresponding\n5\nM terials & Design 2007\nto the average weight of an athlete. We could set a maximum weight to\nthe bicycle, of 1.5 kg say, a penalty if the weight exceeds the expected\nweight, or a premium if it is lighter. Here ranges over which the variables\ncan change are set (for example specifying that only 0o, 90o and \u00b145o ply\norientations can be used in the case of laminates). In this stage is where we\ndefine the size of the problem. By size of the problem we mean the number\nof possible combinations that we are going to analyze using finite element\nanalysis. For example, consider that we can use only unidirectional pre-\npreg fabrics and consider the case that we want to use only symmetric and\nbalanced laminates of 0o, 90o and \u00b145o plies, varying the thickness of the\nlaminate from 4 plies to 20 plies, we will be talking of a possible 140 cases per\nmaterial. If we decide to try 3 different materials, we will be talking of 420\npossible solutions. Therefore, the size of the problem can easily reach very\nbig proportions even for a simple case. Hence the importance of defining in\nthis stage the range and values that the variables can take. Laminate plate\ntheory is then used to calculate material properties for all possible lay-up\ncombinations.\nFinite Element Analysis. At this stage the design is modelled using finite\nelement analysis with MSC.Marc. Other analysis techniques could be ap-\npropriate here, but the emphasis is on real geometries and lay-ups, where\nthe complexities lend themselves to FE analysis. In the early stages of the\ndesign process very accurate results are not needed to identify appropriate\ndesign concepts. Therefore a simple FE model, with modest run times, is\nsufficient. At a later stage in the design process the design methodology can\nbe applied using a more sophisticated model, but with a smaller range of\ndesigns considered. A series of jobs is then submitted for analysis to cover\nall the parameter combinations to be considered (e.g. shape, material prop-\nerties) . Results are read between runs and the relevant output data saved to\na database file. The template file is then modified and a new run submitted.\nThe process is controlled by a code written in Microsoft Visual Basic, which\ntakes the first input file, submits this input file for analysis into MSC.Marc,\nwaits until the analysis has finished, then, it opens the output file, read\nthe results and copy the appropriate values into the database that we are\ncreating in Microsoft Excel. After this has been done, it modifies the input\nfile, changing the variables or the properties we have set on the Definition\nof Problem, and submits this new input file for analysis. It does this until\nall possible combinations set in the previous stage had been analysed.\nCreate Database. A database is constructed containing records for all the\ndesign combinations considered, containing input data (geometry, laminate\nlay-up, etc) and corresponding results, including those from the FE anal-\nysis. The database is built using Microsoft Excel. The database has to be\nstructured in a way that it can be imported into the selection \/ visualisation\nCES software.\nSelection Process \/ Optimisation. The database is imported into the CES\nsoftware. Constraints can now be applied to screen out inappropriate choices,\n6\nMaterials & Design 2007\nthe designs can be ranked using relevant performance indices and a shortlist\nor optimum design identified. This process can be repeated, modifying the\nlimits and constraints, as needed.\nResults. A shortlist of optimum solutions that meets the constraints is iden-\ntified. Within this shortlist of solutions, the designer can choose design\nconcepts that better suit their \u201cfeeling\u201d of the problem, perhaps based on\nprevious experience with composite materials, the infrastructure available\nto produce the design, available expertise in handling composites, etc. In\nthis way judgement and analytical selection methods can be combined in a\ntransparent way that can be easily explained to others in the design team.\nThese chosen solutions can then go forward for further detailed design (e.g.\nusing a more accurate FE model) and testing.\nFig. 2: Design methodology flowchart\n4 Application of the methodology \u2013 Dogbone Case Study\nThe design methodology is illustrated by way of a case study. A dogbone spec-\nimen is considered, with a series of design constraints to simulate a practical\ncomposites design. This case study was chosen as it is simple but neverthe-\n7\nMaterials & De ign 2007\nFig. 3: The organization of the database in an hierarchical way\nless allows consideration of the key challenges in design of composite design\nstructures, including variable geometry, laminate lay-up and laminate rein-\nforcement. The laminate lay-up is considered to be composed of a primary\nlay-up, which has the same ply orientations and thickness over the whole\nstructure, and secondary reinforcement over part of the structure.\n4.1 Definition of problem\n4.1.1 Geometry and loading\nThe component, illustrated in Fig. 4(a) (which shows half of the symmetrical\ncomponent), is of fixed length and width. Axial and shear loads are applied to\nthe ends of the dogbone as indicated. In this study the radius r of the cut-out\nis fixed at 11.67mm.\n4.1.2 Materials\nThe specimen is made of unidirectional pre-preg from one of three materials;\nE-glass\/epoxy, Kevlar\/epoxy or carbon\/epoxy. The properties of these mate-\nrials can be found in Table 1 The thickness of the plies is 0.125 mm. Only\nbalanced symmetric lay-ups are considered (so that only half the thickness of\nthe specimen needs be considered) and only ply orientations of 0o, 90o and\n\u00b145o are used.\n8\nMaterials & Design 2007\n4.1.3 Primary layup\nFor this case study, the layup has been considered as composed of a primary\nlayup, which is constant over the whole specimen, and a secondary reinforce-\nment lay-up over some areas. The total number of plies in the primary lay-up\nwas varied from 4 to 20, to give a total of 140 different combinations of 0o,\n90o and \u00b145o plies (considering that the laminate has to be balanced and\nsymmetric).\n4.1.4 Secondary lay-up (reinforcement)\nThe secondary reinforcement layup consists of extra plies, of the same material\nas the primary layup, applied to various combinations of zones on the specimen\nas illustrated in Fig. 4(a). The reinforcement can have as many as 3 plies per\nhalf of the laminate and it has to be balanced and symmetric (the same lay-up\nhas to be added to the top and bottom of the laminate). This gives a total of\n12 possible reinforcement combinations. Table 3 gives the 12 secondary lay-ups\nconsidered. Five different combinations of reinforcement zones are included,\nas detailed in Table 4.\n4.1.5 Design objectives\nThe design objectives which are considered in the problem are: weight, cost,\ndeflection at the top-left node \u2019A\u2019 due to the applied load, and maximum\nstrain energy density within the specimen. This latter objective is used as\na simplified failure index. The deflection and the strain energy density are\nextracted from the FE output file for each run. The weight is calculated by\nfinding the surface area of the part and multiplying it by the thickness and the\ndensity of the material. The cost is related only to the cost of the material. The\ncost is calculated by multiplying the mass of the component by the cost of the\nmaterial per unit mass. The cost estimate used in this paper is for comparison\npurposes only and to allow cost to be included as a design variable. For a more\naccurate cost a more complex model needs to be used, such as those described\nin [9,7,1].\nThe design constraints, variables and objectives used in the case study are\nsummarised in Table 2. Considering the 140 combinations for the basic lay-\nup, the 12 possible combinations for the secondary lay-up and the five different\nreinforcement cases, we end up with 6860 independent cases for each material.\nWith three different materials being considered, the number of independent\ncases increases to 20,580.\nThe design of a dogbone specimen would seem at first sight to be very simple.\nHowever by including typical features of composites design, including choice\n9\nMaterials & Design 2007\nTable 1: Material Properties (costs are very approximate)\nE11\n(GPa)\nE22\n(GPa)\nG12\n(GPa)\nPoisson\u2019s\nRatio\nDensity\n(kg\/m3)\nCost\n(\u00a3\/kg)\nE-glass\/epoxy\n(Scotchply\/1002)\n39 8.3 4.1 0.26 1900 5\nKevlar\/epoxy\n(Kevlar 49\/934)\n76 5.5 2.3 0.34 1400 25\nCarbon\/epoxy\n(T300\/5208)\n181 10.3 7.17 0.28 1500 100\n(a) Geometry (b) FE model\nFig. 4: Dog-bone case study: (a) geometry; (b) finite element model\nTable 2: Constraints, Variables and Design Objectives\nConstraints\nGeometric: Fixed length and width\nLoading: Fixed shear and axial load\nLay-up: Balanced, symmetric, 0o, 90o and \u00b145o plies only\nVariables\nMaterial (CFRP, glass fibre, Kevlar)\nPly orientations and thicknesses in different regions\nObjectives Weight, Cost, Deflection, Strain Energy Density\nof material and lay-up, use of reinforcements and the constraint of using a\ndiscrete numbers of plies, it transpires that the designer is faced with a large\nnumber of possible solutions, exceeding 20,000 in this case. This wide choice,\nand the complications associated with anisotropic materials and geometric\nfeatures, make it difficult to say a priori which design will be best.\n10\nMaterials & Design 2007\n4.2 Performance calculations and finite element analysis\nA two dimensional finite element linear elastic model of the component was\ngenerated in MSC.Marc, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The tension and shear compo-\nnents of the pressure loading applied to the left-hand end of the component\nwere 100 N\/m, while symmetric boundary conditions were applied at the right-\nhand end. Materials were treated as 2D orthotropic, with elastic properties\n(Ex, Ey, Gxyand \u03bdxy) and material element thickness changed according to the\nprimary and secondary lay-up used. The stiffness matrix of the material was\nobtained using laminate plate theory [10,16,8]. The model takes between 1\nand 2 seconds to run. Each of the 20,580 possible designs was analysed using\nFE to give the maximum strain energy density and the displacement at node\nA.\n4.3 Performance plots\nThe results were used to build a database, which was created with the tree\nstructure shown in Fig. 5, adopting the tree structure approach used for the\nmaterials database of CES. Going from the general to the particular the struc-\nture consists of: a) Composites, b) Material (pre-preg, CFRP, E-glass, Kevlar),\nc) Number of plies in the basic lay-up, d) Possible ply combination to create a\nsymmetric and balanced laminate, e) Reinforcement combinations (secondary\nlay-up) and finally, f) Reinforcement case (where a secondary lay-up is in-\ncluded).\nWith this database it is possible to create 2-D charts to compare the laminate\nperformance using CES software. The results for the 20,580 independent cases\nare shown in Fig. 6. With the tree structure established in the data base, it is\nstraightforward to confirm from Fig. 6(b) the obvious conclusion, that E-glass\n(pink) will be the cheapest solution, then Kevlar (blue), and finally carbon\nfibre will be the most expensive solution, but also the one with the best me-\nchanical properties per unit mass. However Fig. 6(a) the Kevlar solution is\nreasonable where the displacement constraint is not too small. Some Kevlar\nsolutions have displacements less than 0.5 mm and while there is not a signif-\nicant increase in weight compared to carbon fibre specimens, there is a huge\ncost saving. The designer can readily see that, if the deflection constraint can\nbe relaxed a little, choosing a Kevlar specimens will save a substantial amount\nof money (though a more sophisticated cost model would be needed to confirm\nthis conclusion).\nIn summary, by using a tree structure and plotting the results with colour\ncodes, for example by reinforcement combination or reinforcement case, the\n11\nMaterials & Design 2007\nFig. 5: Structure of the Database\nTable 3: Secondary lay-ups\nReinforcement Secondary\ncombination Lay-up\n1 [\u00b145]s\n2 [90]s\n3 [90\/\u00b145]s\n4 [902]s\n5 [903]s\n6 [0]s\n7 [0\/\u00b145]s\n8 [0\/90]s\n9 [0\/902]s\n10 [02]s\n11 [02\/90]s\n12 [03]s\nTable 4: Reinforcements zones\nReinforcement case Zones reinforced\n0 No reinforcement\n1 Zones 3 - 4\n2 Zones 2 - 3\n3 Zones 4 - 5\n4 Zones 2 - 3 - 4 - 5\nselection software can extract useful trends or patterns that may exist in the\nresults. In addition, appropriate constraints can be imposed to narrow the\npossibilities and search for the best solution, as illustrated in the next section.\n4.4 Selection\nIn practical design, there will often be constraints which need to be applied to\nthe design, perhaps arising from mechanical considerations or manufacturing.\n12\nMaterials & Design 2007\nHere we show how these can be applied in an interactive way by the designer.\nThe selection software allows the designer to highlight areas on the perfor-\nmance plots within which the points must fall. For example, a box drawn\nin Fig. 7(a) imposes upper limits on the allowable deflection and mass. Be-\ncause the various performance charts plotting the performance parameters are\nlinked within the CES software, points lying outside the selected area on one\nselection chart are greyed-out on all the graphs. In other words, where differ-\nent areas are selected on several graphs, only points passing all the selection\ncriteria will remain active and coloured, as illustrated in Fig. 7(b).\nTo illustrate how this can be used, we include in the fictional design brief the\nfollowing four design constraints:\n\u2022 Cost \u2264 \u00a33\n\u2022 Mass \u2264 40g\n\u2022 Displacement (at the top corner) \u2264 2mm\n\u2022 Maximum strain energy density\u2264 2x106 N\/m2\nWhen the data are represented graphically and the above constraints applied\nto the graphs (Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)) the number of cases is reduced to 3325.\nIt would then be straightforward to identify suitable designs which meet all\nthe constraints from these charts minimising mass or cost. However, to il-\nlustrate the flexibility of the selection method, consider applying additional\nconstraints, perhaps arising from manufacturing considerations:\n\u2022 The laminate must be quasi-isotropic, so that the primary layup is made of\nplies in the 4 directions - 0o, 90o and \u00b145o.\n\u2022 Reinforcement is applied only in zones 3 and 4, if at all (reinforcement cases\n0 or 1)\n\u2022 A maximum of one extra ply of reinforcement is allowed per half laminate.\nApplying these additional constraints gives only 38 possibilities as shown in\nFig. 7(c) and 7(d). Of these 38, six correspond to E-glass, six to CFRP and the\nremaining 26 to Kevlar. All of these points have a laminate lay-up [0,90,\u00b145]s\nand have one or no reinforcement plies in zones 3 and 4 only. The optimal\nsolution for each material has been found from the mass vs. deflection graph,\nas highlighted in Fig. 7(c). These same points have then been highlighted in\nFig. 7(d). In Figs. 7(c) and 7(d), the cases that do not meet the constraints\nare not shown to aid visualisation.\n13\nMaterials & Design 2007\nFig. 6: Selection charts (magenta = E-glass, blue = Kevlar, red = carbon\nfibre): (a) mass - deflection; (b) cost - strain energy\nFig. 7: Selection charts (magenta = E-glass, blue = Kevlar, red = carbon\nfibre): (a) mass - deflection; (b) cost - strain energy (c) Optimum results;\nmass - deflection; (d) Optimum results; cost - strain energy\n5 Conclusions\nA simple design methodology has been developed, based on a methodology for\nmaterial selection, to optimise composite structures. The method uses finite\nelement analysis to identify the mechanical response of a range of proposed\n14\nMaterials & Design 2007\ndesigns, and commercial selection software to impose appropriate constraints\nand choose between confliction design objectives. The method is ideally suited\nto more complex composite structures. Related work considers includung man-\nufacturing constraints via a draping analysis. For these more complicated\nproblems it is envisaged that an exhaustive search of the design space will\nnot be feasible. Instead genetic algorithms can be used to generate a diverse\npopulation of proposed structures [14,15].\nThe selection methodology for composite structures presented here is readily\naccessible by designers using composite materials. By facilitating substantial\nnumerical modelling input at an early stage of the design process, it is possible\nfor designers with less experience of working with composite structures to\nmake sensible design choices at this stage. The method can also be used to\nhelp understand better the behaviour of composite structures and so develop\na \u2019feel\u2019 for such problems. For example, the flexibility of the methodology can\nbe used to learn from the database of results, identifying trends or patterns in\nthe data that may not be visible otherwise. Finally, a family of databases for\ngeneric geometries with a range of load patterns could be built to save time\nin case of a redesign of a component.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the support of: EPSRC, ESI Soft-\nware SA, Ford Motor Company Ltd., Granta Design Ltd, Hexcel Composites,\nMSC.Software Ltd, University of Nottingham, Polynorm Plastics (UK) Ltd,\nSaint-Gobain Vetrotex International SAS, the U.K. Ministry of Defence and\nCONACyT - Mexico.\nReferences\n[1] P.
