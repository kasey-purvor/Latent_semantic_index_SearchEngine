This lack of \nprogress stems partly from a failure to incorporate in research efforts the findings regarding the \nnature of managerial work, as well as inadequate attention devoted to the detailed practices through \nwhich accounting information is actually used by managers in their work. In this paper I draw on \nprior research to develop a series of propositions focused on three primary insights into how and \nwhy managers use accounting information in their work. First, managers primarily use accounting \ninformation to develop knowledge of their work environment rather than as an input into specific \ndecision making scenarios. In this role, accounting information can help managers to develop \nknowledge to prepare for unknown future decisions and activities. Second, as accounting \ninformation is just one part of the wider information set that managers use to perform their work, it \nis imperative to consider its strengths and weaknesses not in isolation but relative to other sources \nof information at a manager\u2019s disposal. Third, as managers interact with information and other \nmanagers utilising primarily verbal forms of communication, it is through talk rather than through \nwritten reports that accounting information becomes implicated in managerial work. These insights \nhave important implications for how managers use accounting information, and, in particular, \nrequire reconsideration of the types accounting information that managers find, or could find, \nhelpful. The paper also considers how existing experimental and field-based methods could \nfruitfully be adapted to focus on the detailed activities through which managers engage with \naccounting information. \n \n \n 2 \nDespite calls to link management accounting more closely to management (Jonsson, 1998), \nmuch is still to be learned about the role of accounting information in managerial work. For what \npurposes do managers use accounting information beyond its role in specific decision making \nscenarios? With many other information sources on offer, what is it about accounting information \nthat managers find helpful? How exactly is accounting information used by managers in discussions \nand debates with subordinates and other managers?  \nOver ten years ago, Jonsson (1998) exclaimed in the title of his paper the need to \u201crelate \nmanagement accounting research to managerial work!\u201d Despite Jonsson\u2019s (1998) fervent \narguments, future research has generated few studies directed towards understanding how managers \nengage with accounting information in their work. Much management accounting research has been \nfocused on how managers use accounting information to make decisions in well-defined scenarios. \nAlthough managers do make decisions, and many of these are undoubtedly important, empirical \ninvestigations of what managers actually do show that decision making is only a relatively small \npart of managerial work and sometimes not that critical (for example, see Mintzberg, 1973; Kotter, \n1982; Hales, 1986; Stewart, 1988; Whitely, 1985). In addition, much managerial work involves \naddressing problems that involve turbulence, doubt, uncertainty, and the potential for significant \nerror (Hales, 1986; Kotter, 1982; Isenberg, 1984; Landau & Stout, 1979). As such, a strong focus \non how managers use accounting information to make specific decisions in well-defined contexts is \nrestrictive as it limits consideration of other, potentially much more important, ways that managers \nuse accounting information in their work. \nThere is also much to learn about how managers engage with accounting information \nbecause there are remarkably few studies of what information managers actually use or might use \n(Anderson, 2008; March, 1986). In particular, prior studies have devoted inadequate attention to the \ndetailed practices through which accounting information is used by managers in their work (Ahrens \n& Chapman, 2007; Hopwood, 1989). Studies that focus on organisational-level issues only are \nlimited because they are typically based upon assumptions about, rather than a detailed \n 3 \ninvestigation of, managerial work behaviour (Covaleski, Evans, Luft and Shields, 2003; Hall, \n2008a). What is often missing from these organisational accounts is an analysis of the detailed ways \nin which managers use accounting information to perform particular activities.  \nThree studies in particular reveal the kinds of insights that can be generated from inquiries \ndirected more closely at examining how managers engage with accounting information (Simon et \nal., 1954; Preston, 1986; McKinnon & Bruns, 1992). Although best known for its typology of \nscore-keeping, attention directing and problem-solving, the Simon et al. (1954) study provides \nconsiderable evidence concerning how different types of managers used (or did not use) accounting \ninformation. Preston (1986) examined how managers in a plastics factory engaged in what he \ntermed \u201cthe process of informing\u201d, which involved the use of accounting information as well as \nother more informal sources such as observations, personal record keeping and meetings. He \nconcluded that informal sources of information are used in spite of, rather than because of, \nlimitations to formal documented systems as they are intrinsic to how managers go about making \nsense of their worlds. Similarly, although across a wider scope of managers and organisations, \nMcKinnon and Bruns (1992) investigated how a variety of production, sales and finance managers \nused accounting and other information in their work. The resulting confluence of information that \nmanagers developed from many different sources they referred to as an \u201cinformation mosaic\u201d.  \nIn addition to the rich empirical findings, what is particularly illuminating about these \nstudies is that rather than assume particular roles for accounting information, they sought to \ninvestigate if a role exists and what it might be. Simon et al. (1954: 22) examined the \u201cuse (or non-\nuse) of accounting data by operating executives and supervisors\u201d. Preston (1986, 522), beginning \nwith a focus on the use of a computerised production information system, broadened his inquiry to \ninvestigate \u201chow the managers informed themselves and each other\u201d. McKinnon and \nBruns (1992: 2) asked \u201cunder what circumstances is information that we think of as accounting \ninformation actually used by managers?\u201d (italics in original). The phrases \u201cor non-use\u201d, \u201chow\u201d, and \n\u201cactually used\u201d demonstrate that the researchers at least considered the possibility that managers \n 4 \nmay not use accounting information, that its role may be limited, or that new roles and possibilities \nfor accounting information may emerge. In these studies there are few assumptions regarding the \nways in which managers use accounting information; the studies themselves are an attempt to find \nout what these roles, if any, may be. All three studies also examine in considerable detail how \nmanagers engaged with accounting information as part of a process involving other sources of \ninformation, other managers, and the wider organisational context. The studies were not solely \nconcerned with how accounting information was used for decision making purposes, nor were they \nfocused only on how accounting information was implicated in wider organisational processes. \nThese three studies show how managers draw upon a range of different resources, such as \naccounting information, other sources of information, and interactions with other managers, to \nperform their complex and demanding work.  \nThe objective of this paper is to examine, and encourage further research to examine, how \nand why managers use accounting information. Although insightful, collectively, prior studies of \nwhat managers actually do with accounting information lack integration and conceptual clarity such \nthat common themes and issues have not been developed. Drawing on prior research, I develop a \nseries of propositions focused on three primary insights into how and why managers use accounting \ninformation in their work. First, managers primarily use accounting information to develop \nknowledge of their work environment rather than as an input into specific decision making \nscenarios. In this role, accounting information can help managers to develop knowledge to prepare \nfor unknown future decisions and activities (March, 1986; Preston, 1986). Importantly, in a \nknowledge development role, rather than complex and sophisticated reports and analyses, managers \nrequire accounting information that is easily understandable and provides a common-sense story of \norganisational performance. Second, as accounting information is just one part of the wider \ninformation set that managers use to perform their work (McKinnon & Bruns, 1992; Preston, 1986), \nit is imperative to consider its strengths and weaknesses not in isolation but relative to other sources \nof information at a manager\u2019s disposal. In particular, and in contrast to traditional criticisms of \n 5 \naccounting, the strengths of accounting information relate to its aggregation properties and its role \nas a common, financial language to facilitate communication among managers. Third, managers \ninteract with information and other managers utilising primarily verbal forms of communication \n(Kotter, 1982; McKinnon & Bruns, 1992; Preston, 1986; Jonsson, 1998; Ahrens, 1997). As such, it \nis primarily through talk rather than through written reports that accounting information becomes \nimplicated in managerial work. In particular, verbal forms of communication allow managers to \ntailor accounting information to specific operational concerns, and provide a context to debate and \ndiscuss the meanings and implications of accounting data. Accounting information can also prompt \ndiscussions by signalling the need to investigate an issue further. Overall, incorporation of findings \nregarding how managers actually work has important implications for their use of accounting \ninformation, and, in particular, requires reconsideration of the types accounting information that \nmanagers find, or could find, helpful.  \nThis perspective on accounting information and managerial work also has implications for \nresearch methods. Most generally, there is a need for research to examine the specific activities \nthrough which managers engage with accounting information in their work. To achieve this, \nexisting experimental and field-based approaches can fruitfully be adapted. In the context of \nexperiments, a process-based approach (Vygotsky, 1978; Swieringa & Weick, 1982) can be used to \nfocus more directly on how managers engage with accounting information in performing particular \nactivities. In the context of field studies, a stronger focus on examining the micro-practices \n(Hutchins, 1995; Alac & Hutchins, 2004) involved in managers\u2019 use of accounting information can \nimprove our understanding of how managers engage with accounting information in their work.  \nThe remainder of the paper is structured in five sections. Section 1 examines the role of \naccounting information in developing knowledge of the work environment. Section 2 considers \naccounting information as part of a manager\u2019s wider information set. Section 3 explores the relation \nbetween accounting information and forms of communication. Each of these three sections analyses \n 6 \nthe results from prior research and concludes with a set of propositions. Section 4 outlines the \nimplications for research methods. Section 5 concludes the paper.  \n \n1. The role of accounting information in developing knowledge of the work environment \n \nPrior research on the role of accounting information in developing knowledge has primarily \nfocused on how it serves as an information input into specific decisions. In the decision-facilitating \nrole, accounting information, in the form of periodic reports or special analyses, is a source of \ninformation for making decisions (Sprinkle, 2003; Horngren et al., 2005).1 Sprinkle (2003) \nconcludes that the provision of accounting information for decision-facilitating purposes and the \ncharacteristics of that information have been found to improve individuals\u2019 knowledge and their \nability to make better decisions. However, a focus on how managers use accounting information to \nmake specific decisions in well-defined contexts is restrictive as it limits consideration of other \npotentially much more important ways that managers use accounting information in their work. \nAlthough managers do make decisions, and many of these are undoubtedly important, \nempirical investigations of what managers actually do show that such activities are only a relatively \nsmall part of managerial work and sometimes not that critical (for example, see Mintzberg, 1973; \nKotter, 1982; Hales, 1986; Hales, 1999; Stewart, 1988). Much managerial work involves \nresponding to the unusual, the ad hoc, and the unplanned, where problem boundaries are typically \nhazy and unstable (Hales, 1999; Kotter, 1982; Hanaway, 1989). Furthermore, the varied nature of \nmuch managerial work means that managers typically do not deal with one or two problems; rather, \nthey deal with portfolios of problems, where it is unclear how problems are related or how small \nproblems may relate to or be indicative of something more serious (Isenberg, 1984; Hanaway, \n1989). In this way, a critical task for managers is to deal with problems that involve turbulence, \ndoubt, uncertainty, and the potential for significant error (Landau & Stout, 1979). In this context, \n                                               \n1 See Sprinkle (2003), Luft and Shields (2003) and Birnberg, Luft and Shields (2007) for reviews of the use of \naccounting information in decision-making.  \n 7 \nmanagers use information to develop knowledge of their work environment more generally, that is, \nbeyond specific decision-making situations. Managers often use past experiences and prior \nknowledge to develop appropriate responses, make decisions and take actions (Dane & Pratt, 2007). \nAs such, most of the information that managers gather is not for decision-making purposes but is \nused to develop a context of knowledge and meaning for unknown possible future actions (March, \n1986; Feldman & March, 1981; Preston; 1986, McKinnon & Bruns, 1992; Simon et al. 1954). In \nthis process, the significance of information gathering is as an investment in an inventory of \nknowledge, not as an input into a specific decision-making scenario (March, 1986).  \nThe process of developing knowledge of the work environment involves a variety of \nspecific activities. For example, to develop knowledge, managers test and scrutinize their \nassumptions and expectations about the organization, its operations and competitive \nenvironment (Mintzberg, 1973; Senge, 1990; Vandenbosch & Higgins, 1995), identify and define \nproblems and opportunities (Mintzberg, 1973; Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997; Vandenbosch, 1999; \nSimons, 1990), and monitor the environment for surprises, or reassurances there are none, where \nsurprises may be new alternatives, preferences, or significant changes (Feldman & March, 1981; \nPreston, 1986). These activities are reflective of a more general process whereby managers ensure \nthey are up-to-date and informed about significant events and occurrences that relate to their work \nenvironment (Simon et al. 1954; Preston, 1986).  \nAccounting, as a key source of information about business performance, can help managers \nto develop knowledge of the work environment in several ways: to make visible those activities not \nvisible through a manager\u2019s daily activities; and to provide an overall quantitative perspective on \ntheir work. Accounting information can make visible those problems that are not visible from day-\nto-day activities and can provide an independent check on operations to help managers \u201cknow what \nis going on\u201d (Simon et al., 1954: 28). Van der Veeken and Wouters (2002) found that budgeted \nversus actual cost information was crucial for senior managers in managing projects as these \nmanagers were responsible for many projects and used up-to-date information on allowable versus \n 8 \nactual costs to develop knowledge about which projects were causing problems. Accounting \ninformation also helps to \u2018smooth out\u2019 the multitude of organisational activities, which enables \nmanagers to determine the meaning and significance of all the frenetic day-to-day management \nactivity (McKinnon & Bruns, 1992; Preston, 1986). Simon et al. (1954: 28) noted that the \n\u201csignificance of\u2026..(accounting) reports lies in their reminding the operating executives of things \nthey already know, and placing those things in proper quantitative perspective, rather than hinting \nto them things they never suspected\u201d (italics in original). In this role, accounting information can \nprovide an overall assessment of the trends and the net effect of all kinds of disturbances and \nactions that have taken place (Preston, 1986; van der Veeken & Wouters, 2002).  \nThree factors influence the usefulness of accounting information for developing knowledge \nof the work environment: \u2018closeness\u2019 to operational activities, time horizon, and diversity of \noperational factors under consideration. Managers who are close to operations use observations of \nphysical processes and informal reports from subordinates and peers as their primary means of \ndeveloping knowledge of the work environment (Simon et al., 1954, Preston, 1986). For example, \nvan der Veeken and Wouters (2002) reported that operating managers found little use for \naccounting data on budgeted versus actual project costs, but obtained information from observation \nof project activities and a few key non-financial metrics. Managers with little contact with \noperations, however, devote considerable attention to accounting reports as they have limited \nopportunities for picking up information from actual observations of work being conducted (Simon \net al., 1954; McKinnon & Bruns, 1992). For day-to-day concerns, developing knowledge is \nfacilitated most efficiently by non-financial numbers as they relate more directly to operational \nactivities, and, importantly, are usually available immediately without delay (McKinnon & Bruns, \n1992). In contrast, events and transactions take too long to go through the formal accounting \nreporting system for the output to be actionable. For example, McKinnon and Bruns (1992) found \nthat financial numbers were not used in any of the 12 organizations they studied as a key daily \nproduction indicator: all managers used non-financial numbers. Furthermore, the aggregations \n 9 \nrequired for the production of financial numbers can obscure details that are important for \nunderstanding day-to-day problems. For example, an injury to an employee becomes aggregated \nwith other costs and is thus obscured from the manager\u2019s view (McKinnon & Bruns, 1992). As the \ntime horizon lengthens, however, financial information becomes much more important in providing \noverall measures of effectiveness and in highlighting key problem areas that require further \ninvestigation (Simon et al., 1954; McKinnon & Bruns, 1992; Preston, 1986). When managers have \nonly a few operational factors to consider, non-financial measures and direct observation of \nprocesses can provide adequate information. However, as managers consider a more diverse range \nof operational factors, financial information can operate to translate these factors into a single, \nfinancial dimension, which allows for an overall assessment of the net effect of all kinds of \ndisturbances and actions that have taken place (van der Veeken & Wouters, 2002).  \nResearch has also considered the properties of accounting information that are likely to help \nmanagers to develop knowledge of their work environment. One approach to increasing the role of \naccounting in knowledge development activities is to increase its sophistication and complexity. \nTechniques such as the balanced scorecard (Kaplan & Norton, 1996), causal performance \nmaps (Abernethy, Horne, Lillis, Malina & Selto, 2005), performance pyramids (Lynch & Cross, \n1992), and activity-based costing (Kaplan & Cooper, 1998) provide more elaborate, detailed and \ncomprehensive data. These systems attempt to make accounting information a more complete and \nmore relevant description of underlying organizational activities. In contrast to these developments, \nhowever, research shows that accounting information does not need to be elegant, complete or \naccurate to be useful for developing knowledge.  \nMalina, Norreklit and Selto (2007) show that the ability of a performance measurement \nsystem to communicate a common sense and credible story of business operations is far more \nimportant than the creation of a statistically-valid predictive business model. Rowe, Birnberg and \nShields (2008a) report that technical jargon and complexity of accounting information limited \nmanagers\u2019 ability to identify the economic effects of competing initiatives. In another study, Osborn \n 10 \n(1998) finds that the use of simplified accounting information (i.e., information structured around \nkey issues and categories) prompted productive discussion among managers and more time being \ndevoted to building shared interpretations of results. As one manager stated: \u201cI use the [system] as a \nway to frame the business. We need to add structure to the data that we\u2019re reporting: we need \nactionable data, data that leads us to do something. We need to help people identify hot spots.\u201d \n(Osborn, 1998: 495-496, italics in original). Furthermore, information needs to be easily \ncomprehended by managers such that they have confidence in their understanding of the underlying \ndata (McKinnon & Bruns, 1992; Simons, 1995; Preston, 1986). Such confidence is likely to prove \nincreasingly difficult in settings where the complexity of accounting information increases but \nmanagers have little time to spend on understanding it. For example, Ittner and Larcker (2003) note \nthe difficulties and problems managers\u2019 face in understanding and linking non-financial measures to \neach other and to financial measures in the context of complex performance measurement systems.  \nThese findings are consistent with the expectation that the process of developing knowledge \nof the work environment is promoted by managers engaging with simpler information that \nchallenges existing points of view (Gilkey & Kilts, 2007). Complex accounting systems can reduce \nor camouflage the very uncertainties that managers need to be aware of and can eliminate the ability \nto detect and correct error (Earl & Hopwood, 1980; Landau & Stout, 1979). For example, in the \ncontext of variance analysis, Emsley (2001: 34) finds that managers do not prefer detailed variances \nbut a summary of key problems ranked by importance: \u201cinstead of all these variances all I want is a \nlist of the top ten biggest problems to have occurred in the factory through the month.\u201d In the \nperformance measurement context, Hall (2008b) finds that more comprehensive performance \nmeasurement systems reinforce managers\u2019 existing points of view and do not play a role in \nchallenging and developing new ways of thinking.  \nResearch also indicates that developing knowledge of the work environment is likely to be \nfacilitated by information that focuses on stimuli as a whole rather than information that attempts to \ndeliberately decipher cause and effects (Dane & Pratt, 2007; Reber, 1976). Rather than trying to \n 11 \nformalise relations via cause-and-effect chains,2 developing knowledge of the work environment is \nlikely to be facilitated by highlighting key events and outcomes, with managers developing their \nown connections and interpretations. For example, McKinnon and Bruns (1992) found that the \nprocess of recalling the events and activities that occurred during the period of time covered by an \naccounting report, and then seeing their success as reported by accounting information, allowed \nmanagers to associate events and activities with a level of financial performance. This process \nprovided information about linkages between physical events and financial outcomes that managers \ncould use to update their knowledge of operations. Importantly, managers used their own \nexperiences to develop knowledge that linked events and outcomes and did not require accounting \ninformation that made these connections explicit. This is consistent with arguments that formal \ntechniques and procedures can inhibit the operation of individuals more intuitive and \u2018natural\u2019 \nsynthesizing processes (Raiffa, 1968; Dane & Pratt, 2007; Gigerenzer, 2008). \nThis analysis indicates that rather than focus on the development of forms of more complex, \ncomplete and sophisticated accounting information, what is required is a different kind of \nsophistication, one that links more closely with the types of information that will aid managers in \ndeveloping knowledge of the work environment. This discussion is formalised in the following \npropositions: \nProposition 1: Accounting information is used by managers to develop knowledge of their \nwork environment. This involves using accounting information to test assumptions and \nexpectations about the organization\u2019s operations, and to identify problems, opportunities and \npotential surprises.  \n \nProposition 1a: Accounting information is more (less) helpful for knowledge \ndevelopment when a manager is further removed from (closer to) operational activities, \nthe time horizon of the issue under consideration is longer (shorter), and the number of \noperational factors to consider is larger (smaller).  \n \nProposition 1b: Accounting information is more (less) likely to facilitate managers\u2019 \nknowledge development when it highlights (doesn\u2019t highlight) the outcomes of key \nevents, is structured (not structured) around issues of managerial importance, is free of \n(contains) jargon, and does not (does) decipher cause and effect relations.  \n \n                                               \n2 Whether this is even possible and\/or desirable is the subject of much debate in the research literature (Norreklit, 2003; \nIttner & Larcker, 2003; Malina et al., 2007). \n 12 \n2. Accounting information as one part of a manager\u2019s information set \n \nThis section analyses the role of accounting information as just one part of a manager\u2019s \ninformation set, and, in particular, considers the strengths of accounting information vis-\u00e0-vis other \ninformation at a manager's disposal. Strengths of accounting information include its aggregation \nproperties and its role as a common language to facilitate communication among managers with \ndifferent backgrounds, experience and knowledge.  \nFor managers who are engaged in a variety of tasks in complex social and organisational \ncontexts, information needs are diverse and encompass a wide range of information from various \nsources, both internal and external to the organization. Managers use not just accounting \ninformation but information from other specialists, information on market, industry and economic \nconditions, as well as direct observation and informal reports (see, for example, Kotter, 1982; \nHanaway, 1989; McKinnon & Bruns, 1992; Preston, 1986). In contrast, much management \naccounting research tends to focus on how managers use accounting information only and devotes \nlittle attention to other types of information that managers use (McKinnon & Bruns, 1992). \nHowever, the sheer variety of tasks that managers engage with, and the rapid, fragmentary and \ndisjointed way in which they are conducted, necessitates engaging with an extensive amount of \ninformation from a wide variety of sources.  \nMcKinnon and Bruns (1992) found that managers use a vast array of information in \nperforming their jobs, ranging from facts and forecasts to gossip, intuition and \u2018gut feel\u2019. Although \nmanagers described accounting information as indispensable, it formed only one small part of the \ninformation they used. Other information besides accounting, particularly observation of physical \nflows and reports of events and activities from subordinates and peers (informal reports), were \navailable for managers to consider, evaluate and act on often before they were observed by the \naccounting process. Similarly, Simon et al. (1954) noted the existence of unofficial reports kept by \noperating executives, sometimes termed \u201cblack books\u201d. They were used constantly by operating \n 13 \nmanagers and contained some accounting figures, but consisted mainly of numbers from production \nreports and other physical data, notes, memos and informal notations. Managers also develop vast \nnetworks of contacts, both within and outside the organisation, which includes subordinates, peers, \noutsiders, bosses\u2019 bosses, subordinates\u2019 subordinates, customers, bankers and the press (Kotter, \n1982; Whiteley, 1985; Hanaway, 1989).  \nManagers rely on multiple information sources to corroborate the different types of \ninformation that they use. For example, McKinnon and Bruns (1992) noted how a sales manager \nmay see corroboration in the number of orders received, call reports, competitive prices, inventory \nlevels, and economic news. Similarly, Hopwood (1972) notes how profit conscious managers probe \ninto the significance and meaning of accounting data, supplementing them with many other sources \nof information, both formal and informal, which allows for a continued test of the validity of the \naccounting data. The use of corroborating information is not restricted to those managers concerned \nwith operations; even financial managers seek to corroborate accounting information: \u201cI get \ninformation about production directly from them, but also from cost accounting. Much of the \nproduction data is not accounting data. There are other metrics like on-time delivery to customers, \nhow many vendor schedule changes we have. There are a lot of different metrics we use to assure \nwe have good inventory integrity\u201d (McKinnon & Bruns, 1992: 201).  \nThis analysis highlights the wide variety of information that managers engage with in \nconducting their work activities, of which accounting information is a small but sometimes \nimportant part. \u201cAccounting, in other words, is part of a wider whole\u201d (Hopwood, 2007: 1367). The \npositioning of accounting information within a wider information set helps to develop a more \ncritical understanding of its relative strengths. In particular, the aggregation process inherent in the \naccounting system serves to provide information to managers not generally available from other \nsources. Because the accounting process assigns financial numbers to a diversity of operational \nfactors, they can be combined and thus compared through a process of aggregation. In this way we \nsee how accounting information is useful in developing knowledge of the work environment by \n 14 \nhelping managers to identify what all the frenetic operational activities add up to and by assessing \ntrade-offs among different factors (Simon et al., 1954; van der Veeken & Wouters, 2002; Wouters \n& Verdaasdonk, 2002). Other information available to managers, such as informal reports and even \nnon-financial information, generally do not have these properties as they are not expressed using the \nsame basis of measurement and thus are not easily combined and compared. In particular, linking \nnon-financial measures to each other and to financial measures is problematic (Ittner & Larcker, \n2003). As such, although aggregation may limit the usefulness of accounting information for some \nroles, it can help rather than hinder the conduct of particular aspects of managerial work.3   \nThe translation of operational activities into financial numbers also serves another function: \nto act as a common language with which managers can communicate. As a common language, \naccounting information can be used as an anchor to frame discussions amongst managers (Simons, \n1990; Ahrens & Chapman, 2007). Accounting information can play a key role in consensus \nbuilding by constructing a common set of information to facilitate communication (Rowe et al., \n2008b). This is critical as structuring and framing of issues in a common language helps to produce \nmeaning (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981; Simons, 1990). If information is not uniformly framed, \ncommon interpretations are unlikely (Chenhall, 2005), and managers may thus find it more difficult \nto communicate with each other. Consistent with this, Rowe et al. (2008a) find that the use of a new \naccounting model based on a simplified accounting language, rather than technical accounting \njargon and codes, helped managers in a cross-functional team to communicate with each other and \nto debate cost issues amongst themselves.4  \n                                               \n3 There are limits to this role as not all operational factors are amenable to expression in financial terms (Galbraith, \n1973; Chapman, 1997). For example, Simons (1995) shows how some strategic uncertainties are best addressed using \naccounting-based information systems (e.g., profit planning systems to frame discussions about how changes in \nproducts and markets are likely to affect future profits) whereas others are not (e.g., intelligence systems to collect \ninformation about social, political and technical environments). See Simons (1991; 1995) and Chapman (1997) for \nfurther discussion. \n4 This has important implications for target costing practices which typically involve a variety of managers from \ndifferent functional areas. In this setting, complex costing models, like sophisticated activity-based costing, may be \ndamaging as non-accounting team members are unlikely to have the necessary expertise to converse confidently using \nsuch information. As Rowe et al. (2008a) find, what is required is relatively simplified cost information that forms a \nbasis for discussion around cost reduction initiatives.  \n 15 \nThis indicates that the use of accounting information depends not necessarily on its ability to \ndepict operational processes accurately or completely, but on its functioning as a medium through \nwhich seemingly diverse operational considerations are rendered communicable through a common \nlanguage. In this way, an accounting language can function as a medium to facilitate \ncommunication among managers with different information requirements, backgrounds and \nfunctional experience. Using accounting as a common language is likely to be particularly \nimportant in organisations where managers who work together have diverse educational \nbackgrounds and\/or in multinational organisations where managers are from different cultures. \nFurthermore, an accounting language is likely to be very important in settings where managers need \nto communicate extensively across functional boundaries, for example, research and development \nmanagers liaising with marketing managers. Here, accounting information can be used to create \ncommon categories for ordering and framing the discussions that take place between managers from \ndifferent functional groups (for further elaboration, see, for example, Bowker & Star (1999); Power \n(2004); Espeland & Sauder (2007) and Millo & Mackenzie (2009)). An accounting language is also \nlikely to be increasingly important in communicating with managers outside the organization as \nnew forms of inter-organisational relationships become more prevalent (e.g., Dekker, 2004). \nOverall, this analysis indicates that understanding the role of accounting in managerial work \nrequires the positioning of accounting information as one part of a manager\u2019s information set. Such \nan approach can facilitate understanding of how accounting information interacts with other sources \nof information, and, in particular, the strengths of accounting information relative to other \ninformation at a manager\u2019s disposal. This can lead to questioning of the need to develop more \ncomplex accounting information in the context of an information set that may already adequately \nprovide such information from other sources. A more fruitful approach is to focus on the strengths \nof accounting information, such as its aggregation properties and role as a common language. This \nanalysis leads to the following propositions:  \n \n 16 \nProposition 2: As accounting information is just one part of a manager\u2019s information set \n(including direct observations, informal reports, industry\/market\/economic data, other \nspecialist information), its strengths and weaknesses are determined not in isolation but \nrelative to other sources of information at a manager\u2019s disposal. \n \nProposition 2a: The primary advantage of accounting information vis-\u00e0-vis other \ninformation is its ability to translate operational factors into a single, financial \ndimension. A single, financial dimension allows managers to compare operational \nfactors and provides a common language to facilitate managerial discussions.  \n \nProposition 2b: A single, financial dimension is more (less) helpful when the diversity \nof operational factors is high (low), when managers\u2019 functional, educational and\/or \ncultural backgrounds are more (less) diverse, and when the extent of communication \nacross functional borders is high (low). \n \n3. Accounting information and forms of communication \n \nIn addition to consideration of a wider information set, understanding the role of accounting \ninformation in managerial work requires an appreciation of the forms of communication that \nmanagers use when engaging with accounting information. This section examines how managers\u2019 \npreference for verbal communications affects the use of accounting information in managerial \nwork. In particular, verbal communication allows managers to tailor accounting information to \nspecific operational concerns, and provides a context to debate and discuss the meanings and \nimplications of accounting data. Furthermore, accounting information can also prompt managerial \ndiscussions that take place.  \nManagers have a strong preference for verbal communication, preferring contacts with \npeople in meetings, informal discussions, and via the telephone (Kotter, 1982; Hales, 1986; \nHanaway, 1989; McKinnon & Bruns, 1992; Preston, 1986). Managers use these verbal contacts to \neasily bypass formal organisation charts and seek information from those people who have it, rather \nthan wait for information to arrive from formal channels (McKinnon & Bruns, 1992; Preston, \n1986). As such, most of a manager\u2019s time is spent with other people, with verbal communications \u2013 \neither in-person or by telephone \u2013 dominating all other kinds (McKinnon & Bruns, 1992). \n 17 \nDespite the importance of verbal communications in managerial work, the focus of much \nresearch typically concerns the design and dissemination of the \u201cproducts\u201d of accounting systems; \nnamely written documentation in the form of reports and analyses. In particular, efforts to make \naccounting information more relevant for managerial work usually focus on improving its content, \nfor example, non-financial performance measures, balanced scorecards, performance pyramids, and \nactivity-based costing systems (for example, Fisher, 1995, Lynch & Cross, 1992, Kaplan & Cooper, \n1998; Kaplan & Norton, 1996, Ittner & Larcker, 2003). Other research examines how the \nusefulness of accounting information is related to how it is organised and displayed (for example, \nLipe & Salterio, 2002; Cardinaels, 2008). Although important, a sole focus on accounting \ninformation in written form limits consideration of how managers actually use accounting \ninformation in performing their work. In particular, the relevance of accounting information is not \nsolely a function of its information characteristics and\/or how it is organised\/displayed, but is highly \ndependent on whether and how managers use accounting information in verbal communications.  \nFor example, McKinnon and Bruns (1992) found that information discussed in verbal \ncommunications is not limited to gossip, intuition or qualitative items; rather, most numerical data \nappeared to be passed by word of mouth first, with formal reports serving to corroborate or remind \nmanagers of what was transmitted orally. This relates to research that highlights the importance of \n\u2018accounting talk\u2019, whereby accounting information becomes implicated in managerial work \nprimarily through verbal communications rather than through reports (Ahrens, 1997; Jonsson & \nSolli, 1994). In particular, verbal communication of accounting information is not just an exchange \nof information but a process through which accounting information is related to specific managerial \nproblems or issues (Ahrens, 1997). Thus, even if the content of accounting information is not \nspecifically relevant for a manager\u2019s work, verbal discussions can facilitate the tailoring of \naccounting information to address issues that managers deem important. In this way, managers \nwork with accounting information to make it relevant, rather than its relevance being determined \nsolely by its content. This is consistent with research showing that managers construct meaning \n 18 \nfrom information for themselves and are not mere processors of information from reports (e.g., \nDent, 1991; Ahrens, 1997; Chapman, 1998; Jonsson, 1998). Echoing the findings from many \nstudies, Boland (1993, 135) concludes that \u201cthe reader of the accounting report is in no sense an \nuninvolved, passive recipient of a clear and obvious message that the report is supposed to \ncarry\u2026they take individual responsibility for reshaping the raw data in the text and reclaiming from \nit a set of the truly important data.\u201d Hence, it is not primarily the design of accounting that \ndetermines its relevance, but how managers actually interpret and use such information, often in \nverbal communications.  \nVerbal communication of accounting information also provides opportunities for managers \nto obtain more tacit forms of information. Managers often value information that is speculative and \ninformal (tacit) rather than information that is authoritative and formal (explicit) (Mintzberg, 1973; \nHales, 1986; Turner & Makhija, 2006). Although accounting information in the form of reports and \nanalyses is likely to be explicit, verbal communications around the meaning and implications of \naccounting information can facilitate the exchange of more tacit forms of information, and provide \na context within which to debate and discuss the meanings and implications of accounting data. In \nthis way, verbal communication of accounting information can enable more tacit information \nexchange and potentially make it much more relevant to managerial work. Importantly, managers \ninvolved in tasks comprising innovative problem solving and unexpected outcomes tend to rely on \ninterpersonal communication and intensive forms of information exchange, with little emphasis on \nthe codification of knowledge via formal reports (Ditillo, 2004).  \nThe role of accounting information in verbal communications is not limited to the exchange \nof information, however. More fundamentally, when mobilised as part of an organisational system, \naccounting information can prompt discussions by signalling that something must be looked into \nmore carefully (Simons, 1995; Mintzberg, 1975; Simon et al. 1954). Ahrens and Chapman (2007) \nshow how accounting information was used to identify areas of off-standard performance and to \nprompt discussions between managers about potential actions and solutions. For example, a below-\n 19 \naverage food margin prompted questioning from the area manager as to its potential causes, which \ninitiated a discussion centring on several likely explanations, such as burnt steaks or over-\nportioning of dishes. Simon et al. (1954) describe how a production manager frequently and \nregularly commented on a monthly variance report and required explanations of variances from a \nfactory manager. Not only did the factory managers seek to provide these explanations in \ndiscussions with superiors, but he was using the same practice with his department heads, and the \ndepartment heads with their foreman. In these situations, accounting information prompts \ndiscussions primarily through the design of the accounting information itself, i.e., the accounting \ninformation reports a deviation (such as a below average food margin), which then prompts \ninvestigation and discussion. More recently, Simons (1995) outlined how interactive control \nsystems prompt discussions among managers where information from formal systems provides the \nbasis for debates over underlying data, assumptions and action plans.5 Here, accounting information \nprompts discussion primarily through managers interpreting accounting information and then \ninitiating discussions about issues they deem important (even in the absence of specific deviations). \nOverall, this analysis shows how accounting information is not merely exchanged verbally but can \nserve a more fundamental role in prompting discussions that take place.  \nWhilst a stronger focus on the communication of accounting information in verbal forms is \nwarranted, this should not occur in isolation from other forms of communication. What is \nparticularly interesting is whether and how verbal and written forms of accounting information act \nas substitutes or complements. Prior research provides little insight into whether accounting \ninformation communicated verbally is the same or different from accounting information that is \ncommunicated in written form. Whilst research is limited, it appears that verbal communication is \nsuited to more tacit, speculative, and specific forms of accounting information, whereas written \n                                               \n5 Most attention in the accounting literature, however, has focused on the organisational-level effects from the \ninteractive use of particular accounting systems, such as budgets and performance measurement systems (Abernethy \nand Brownell, 1999; Bisbe and Otley, 2004; Henri, 2006). This research has predominately used the descriptions and \ncharacteristics of interactive control systems as described by Simons to develop items for questionnaires (Bisbe, \nBatista-Foguet and Chenhall, 2007), rather than investigate the nature of the interactive control process itself. Thus, \nknowledge of the way in which accounting information is used to prompt discussions as part of an interactive control \nsystem is limited. \n 20 \ncommunication is more suited to explicit, formalised and aggregate forms of accounting \ninformation (see Daft & Lengel, 1984). It is also unclear whether there exists much overlap and \nredundancy in the accounting information communicated in verbal and written forms. Verbal and \nwritten forms of accounting information have the potential to reinforce each other and thus act as \ncomplements. In particular, prior research indicates that managers value some information \nredundancy as it serves to remind managers of previous information and also builds confidence in \nthe information through a process of corroboration (McKinnon & Bruns, 1992; Simon et al., 1954; \nPreston, 1986).  \n This analysis indicates that managers\u2019 preference for verbal exchanges of information can \naffect the use of accounting information in managerial work. In contrast to written reports and \nanalyses, verbal communication allows managers to relate accounting information to specific \noperational concerns and to discuss and debate the meaning and implications of accounting data. \nFurthermore, accounting information can prompt the discussions that managers have with each \nother. This leads to the following propositions: \n \nProposition 3: The relevance of accounting information for managerial work is determined \nprimarily by how managers use and interpret accounting information in verbal \ncommunications and discussions. \n \nProposition 3a: Managers use verbal forms of communication to relate accounting \ninformation to specific operational concerns and to discuss and debate the meanings \nand implications of accounting data.  \n \nProposition 3b: Accounting information can prompt verbal discussions by signalling \nthat an issue must be investigated further.  \n \n 21 \nThis analysis shows how the nature of managerial work has important implications for the \nway in which managers engage with accounting information. In particular, managers are likely to \nacquire information for purposes other than solving specific problems, source information from a \nwide information set, and use mainly verbal forms of communication. This indicates different and \npotentially more important roles for accounting information in managerial work that move beyond \nthe use of written analyses and reports to solve specific problems. Drawing on prior research I \noutlined a series of propositions directed towards increasing understanding of how and why \nmanagers use accounting information.6 First, future research can examine how managers use \naccounting information to develop knowledge of their work environment. Second, as managers\u2019 use \nof accounting information takes place within a wider information set, future research can focus on \nthe role of accounting information relative to the other sources of information at a manager\u2019s \ndisposal. Third, as managers favour and use mainly verbal forms of communication, there is a need \nto examine how accounting information is used in managerial work through verbal \ncommunications. In the next section I outline the implications of this analysis for research methods.  \n \n4. Finding out how managers use accounting information \n \n Existing experimental and field-based methods can be fruitfully adapted to examine how \nmanagers use accounting information. Overall, I argue for a stronger focus on the detailed activities \nthrough which managers engage with accounting information.  In the context of experiments, a \nprocess-focus can be used to examine how participants engage with accounting information in \nperforming their work. In the context of field studies, a stronger focus on micro-practices can be \nused to examine the specific activities in which managers engage with accounting information in \ninteraction with other information and other managers.  \n \n \n                                               \n6 These propositions will require further articulation and adaptation to the specific research design employed in a study. \n 22 \n4.1 Process-based experimental studies \n \n Given their research focus, many experimental studies are designed to examine how variable \nX (e.g., an ABC report) is causally related to variable Y (e.g., cost-related judgement performance) \n(Cardinaels, 2008). Although important in these contexts, such an approach is not amenable for \nunderstanding how accounting information is implicated in the demanding, confusing, and \nunstructured situations that characterise much managerial work. In particular, rather than serve as \nan input into a pre-defined decision-making context, managers engage with accounting information \nto construct their own interpretations, drawing on their experience, prior knowledge, other sources \nof information and discussions with other managers. This is a dynamic process in which the \nunderlying accounting information itself can be transformed, thus creating further possibilities for \naction (Burchell et al., 1980; Hopwood, 1978). Within this perspective, experimental approaches \nthat focus on relating variable X to variable Y are not helpful for examining how managers engage \nwith accounting information in performing their work. As such, I argue that process-based \nexperimental studies have much to offer to the analysis of how managers engage with accounting \ninformation in their work. \nProcess-based experiments are concerned with analysing the processes that individuals \nengage in as they conduct particular activities (Vygotsky, 1978; Daniels et al., 2007; Swieringa & \nWeick, 1982). The critical object of analysis is not the output that individuals produce but the \nmethods, processes and activities that participants engage in when conducting tasks. The \nexperimental setting is used to provide a context for investigation where the researcher manipulates \nits structure to examine how participants develop their own processes and analyses (Engestrom, \n2007). The focus is \u201cnot on the product of development but on the very process by which higher \nforms (of development) are established\u201d (Vygotsky, 1978: 64). \nTwo examples illustrate the difference between a process-based approach and that adopted \nin much management accounting research. First, in many experimental designs participants \n 23 \ncomplete a pre-trial run to enhance validity. In contrast, a process-based approach views the pre-\ntrial phase as critical in its own right as it is at this moment that researchers can observe and analyse \nhow participants engage in the task while they are still learning it \u2013 after the pre-trial phase \nbehaviour becomes fossilised and opportunities for examining how participants struggle with new \ntasks and new information is limited (Vygotsky, 1978). In this way, the pre-trial phase provides \nopportunities for examining how managers engage with accounting information in the more \nunstructured, uncertain moments that characterise much managerial work. Second, descriptions and \nexplanations from participants about how they arrived at particular decisions are likely to be very \nvaluable in understanding how managers use accounting information. However, although prior \nresearch does acknowledge the ability of experiments to report on the processes involved in arriving \nat decisions (Sprinkle, 2003: 289), rarely is this empirical material actually analysed. For example, \nVera-Munoz et al. (2007) collected data on participants\u2019 supporting calculations and rationales for \ntheir recommendations, but the empirical analysis is focused solely on the actual budget allocation \nsuggested by participants. Similarly, Coletti et al. (2005) required participants to write an essay \ndescribing the reasoning behind their resource allocation decisions, but this data was used by other \nparticipants to determine a \u2018trustworthiness\u2019 score rather than as useful empirical material in its own \nright. In contrast, Boland (1993) used participants\u2019 written explanations for their performance \nevaluation decisions as a way to understand how managers interpreted accounting reports. The \nprimary interest was not participants\u2019 choices regarding whether to promote manager East or \nmanager West, but how they used accounting reports to arrive at their judgements. From this \nanalysis Boland (1993) generated significant insight into how participants use accounting reports to \nmake performance evaluation judgements. \nOverall, a process-based experimental approach could prove fruitful in systematising \nobservations (Swieringa & Weick, 1982; Hogarth, 1982) of how managers go about using \naccounting information in their work. I outline three specific examples. First, to understand how \nmanagers use different forms of information, existing experiments could be adapted by providing \n 24 \nparticipants with different types of information in addition to accounting information. For example, \nthe Cardinaels (2008) study could be adapted by providing participants with other forms of \ninformation beyond the ABC report, such as: a marketing report about sales trends in the specific \nmarket segment, macroeconomic information, an informal report from a subordinate about relations \nwith the three major customers, an email exchange from a contact who works in a similar \norganisation and has dealt with the three customers, production information showing excessive \ndowntime on a manufacturing line used to produce one of the products, and the manager\u2019s personal \nnotebook of information. Participants are required to complete the specific task but the focus is not \non how decisions vary between experimental conditions but on examining how participants use \ndifferent types of information to arrive at their decisions. In contrast, existing studies are typically \nconcerned with the effects of the presence\/absence of accounting information or differences in its \nform\/presentation, in settings where no other information is provided. The approach described here \nallows the researcher to examine how participants use accounting information in the presence of \nother sources of information. For example, participants may ignore the accounting information, or \nmake the same decision regardless of its presence\/absence. \nSecond, as knowledge of how managers use accounting information in verbal \ncommunications is limited, researchers could construct settings involving several managers in \ndiscussions about particular operational and\/or strategic issues facing an organisation. In particular, \nin the \u2018interactive\u2019 control context, a participant can act as the senior manager who 'intervenes in the \ndecision activities of subordinates' and other participants can act as the operating subordinates who \n'explain and justify their data, assumptions and action plans' (Simons, 1990). Simons\u2019s case studies \nand\/or teaching cases could be used to develop the specific experimental settings.7 The researcher \ncan observe and analyse in detail the interpersonal dynamics involved in this process and how \nparticipants use various types of information, including accounting, in their discussions and \nexplanations.  \n                                               \n7 In particular, see Simons (1995) and the Harvard Business School teaching cases: \u2018Codman Shurtleff, Inc\u2019 (9-187-\n081) and \u2018ATH Micro Technologies\u2019 (9-108-091).  \n 25 \nThird, to understand how managers use accounting information to identify problems, \nresearchers could develop a simulation where groups of participants are managers at a hypothetical \norganisation. As part of the simulation managers arrive at \u2018work\u2019 and are confronted with a variety \nof issues that may or may not require their attention and action, for example, a poor performing \nemployee, possible decline of a line of credit from a financial institution, a looming industrial \nstrike, a possible plant closure, problems with a major supplier, etc (see Lombardo & McCall, 1982, \nfor further examples). Although building simulations is difficult, time consuming and risky \n(Swieringa & Weick, 1982), some simulations already exist that could provide models for \ndevelopment.8 In this context, the researcher can observe how problems are recognised or ignored, \nthe process of problem definition, and the way in which managers search for and integrate \naccounting and other sources of information (Swieringa & Weick, 1982; Hogarth, 1982). \nSimulations can focus on how managers use accounting information in chaotic, confusing and time-\npressured environments, where the objective of the task is to develop knowledge about a potential \nproblem rather than solve an already-constructed problem.  \nIn all three situations the empirical material could be obtained in many ways: direct \nobservation by the researcher as participants perform the task(s), audio\/video recording of \nconversations\/explanations, written materials used during task performance, pre- and post-\nexperimental questionnaires, post-experimental explanatory statements, as well as specific \ndecisions. Overall, adopting a process approach to experimental studies offers much promise for \ndeveloping knowledge about how and why managers use accounting information.  \n \n                                               \n8 For example: \u2018Looking Glass, Inc\u2019 from the Centre for Creative Leadership \n(www.ccl.org\/leadership\/programs\/LGEOverview.aspx, Lombardo & McCall, 1982), the \u2018Treasury Dealing Room\u2019 \nfrom Monash University (www.buseco.monash.edu.au\/aaf\/research\/tdr\/, Lambert et al., 2008), and Harvard Business \nSchool\u2019s online case simulations, e.g., \u2018Beer Game\u2019 and \u2018Back Bay Battery\u2019 \n(http:\/\/harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu\/hbsp\/course_materials.jsp?_requestid=64691). \n 26 \n4.2 Micro-practices in field studies \n \nIn contrast to the experimental approach, field studies seek to examine how individuals \nengage with accounting information in organisational settings. Although the field researcher has \nless control over participants, there is much greater potential for open-ended interaction between the \nresearcher and participants and thus more opportunities to learn from unprompted actions that the \nresearcher had not previously considered (Ahrens & Chapman, 2006). This advantage is evident in \nthe studies of Simon et al. (1954), Preston (1986) and McKinnon and Bruns (1992) where the open-\nended nature of the research questions allowed the researchers to provide new insights into whether \nand how managers used accounting information in their respective organisational settings. For \nexample, Simon et al. (1954) did not enter their study with the intention of examining the \nscorekeeping, attention-directing and problem solving roles of accounting information; these roles \nemerged from their observation and analysis of how managers used accounting information in the \nfield. \nField studies offer the primary advantage of being able to examine how managers use \naccounting information in culturally-constituted settings (see Ahrens & Dent, 1998 and Ahrens & \nChapman, 2006 for overviews of field study methodology). However, much prior research has been \ndirected more towards the macro analysis of organisational issues, with less focus on the \nmicro-practices through which accounting information is used by managers in their work (Ahrens & \nChapman, 2007). Studies that focus on organisational-level issues only are limited because they are \ntypically based upon assumptions about, rather than a detailed investigation of, managerial work \nbehaviour (Covaleski, Evans, Luft and Shields, 2003; Hall, 2008a). As such, what is less evident in \nthese organisational accounts is an analysis of the detailed ways in which managers use accounting \ninformation to perform particular activities.  \nI argue that field studies could focus more strongly on examining the micro-practices \ninvolved in managers\u2019 use of accounting information. Micro-practices are those specific instances \n 27 \nin which managers use accounting information in their work. For example: what do managers do \nwhen they use accounting information to identify problems, surprises and opportunities? What do \nmanagers do when they integrate accounting and other forms of information? And what do \nmanagers do when they relate accounting information to specific operational concerns? These \nquestions can best be answered by investigating those instances when managers actually do these \nthings; by looking and seeing how these activities are actually conducted. A stronger focus on \ninvestigating micro-practices is also reflective of an increased interest in examining the actual use \nof calculative practices by actors at work (Vollmer, Mennicken & Preda, 2008).  \nAn examination of micro-practices involves analysis of the specific activities that individuals \nengage in with on-going analysis of the overall context within which such activities take place \n(Hutchins, 1995; Alac & Hutchins, 2000; Lave, 1988). In this approach, the analysis of context \nprovides the knowledge necessary to make meaningful and valid interpretations of micro-practices \n(Alac & Hutchins, 2004). For example, Jonsson (1998) examined the use of accounting information \nin an individual team meeting at a Swedish municipality. The understanding of the history and \ncontext of the municipality provided the necessary knowledge to interpret how managers in the \nteam meeting used accounting information to perform their work. More generally, Alac and \nHutchins (2004, 633) explain the rationale of this approach in their study of how scientists interpret \nscans from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI):  \nIn order to find out how scientists construct the meaning of complex fMRI images, \nwe perform micro-analysis on digital video recordings of scientific practices. We use \nthese recordings to identify and track the representations that the scientists bring into \ncoordination with the images in the process of making the images meaningful. We \nuse the findings from our long-term ethnography to provide warrants for our analytic \njudgments concerning how things and events are made relevant to one another in a \nsmall instance of scientific practice. \n \nIn the context of accounting information and managerial work, such an approach requires \nexamination of the specific activities in which accounting information is used, other sources of \ninformation at managers\u2019 disposal, and the forms of communication through which accounting \ninformation is engaged - all of which are critical in increasing understanding of how managers use \n 28 \naccounting information in performing their work activities. In this approach, information about the \norganisational context and institutional environment plays a supporting role, i.e., it is necessary in \norder to understand and explain how and why managers use accounting information in particular \nways. For example, Jonsson (1998) described the wide range of information collected about the \nSwedish municipality and its institutional environment, ranging from economic crises, \norganizational restructuring, external surveys, as well as interviews with managers. The study is not \nprimarily concerned with this empirical material, however, but is focused on interpreting and \nmaking judgements about the practices observed at a specific meeting.9 Efforts to generate \nsufficient knowledge of the context are by no means trivial, and will likely require the researcher to \nnot only understand the context but also to attempt to learn the practices themselves (Jorgensen & \nMessner, 2009). For example, to understand the actions of scientists, Alac and Hutchins (2004) \nrequired at least a basic knowledge of fMRI. The time and skill required for such an approach \nclearly presents challenges to researchers, but also opens up extensive opportunities for much closer \nand more direct examination of how managers use accounting information in their work.  \nEthnographies of the activities of individual managers are likely to be particularly useful in \nexamining how accounting information is used (or not used) by managers in performing their work. \nEthnographies are important for two reasons: first, they allow the researcher to examine the full \nrange of a manager\u2019s interactions with accounting information, other sources of information, and \ndifferent forms of communication; and, second, they provide opportunities for investigating both \nthe formal and informal interactions that comprise the ways in which managers use accounting \ninformation. For example, Preston (1986) found that managers kept informed primarily through \ninformal interactions with other managers and through their own observations and personal records.  \nAs part of the ethnography researchers can select specific practices for micro-analysis of \nhow accounting information is used in managerial work. For example, within the context of a \nmanager\u2019s ongoing effort to develop knowledge of the work environment, the researcher can \n                                               \n9 Of course, empirical material relating to wider organisational and institutional issues can be the primary focus in other, \nmore macro-level analyses. \n 29 \nexamine how an individual manager interprets specific accounting reports and other forms of \ninformation. This can help develop understanding of the relationship between different forms of \ninformation (complements or substitutes), the relative advantages of accounting information vis-\u00e0-\nvis other information, as well as knowledge of how managers actually use accounting information \nin performing their work. In this approach, knowledge of the managerial context obtained through \nin-depth analysis of managerial work provides the insight necessary to make meaningful \ninterpretations of the micro practices.10 \nOne difficulty in examining micro-practices in the field, however, is that activities do not \nnecessarily take place in predictable locations. For example, managers may talk to each other in \ncorridors, review accounting information whilst on the train, have telephone and email \nconversations, etc. In contrast, prior research on micro practices has examined activities that take \nplace in relatively predictable locations, e.g.,  ship navigation (Hutchins, 1995) and interpreting \nMRI scans (Alac & Hutchins, 2004). One approach to overcome this difficulty is to focus on \nmeetings as a specific setting in which it is very likely that accounting information is used. \nMeetings are at specific times\/locations and often concern a variety of different purposes, thus \naffording the opportunity to examine how managers use accounting information in different ways. \nFor example, how managers use accounting information in the following roles (meetings) could be \nexamined: to communicate strategies and organisational performance (status meetings), to construct \nand solve problems (project meetings for specific decisions), and to inform and be informed about \non-going activities (recurring team meetings). Jonsson and Macintosh\u2019s (1997, 384) approach to the \nanalysis of a lean-production team meeting can serve as a model for developing this kind of micro-\nanalysis. In this way, the researcher can use meetings as a relatively predictable location for \nconducting micro analysis. Furthermore, the researcher can analyse the interpersonal dynamics, \n                                               \n10 Further elaboration of the use of ethnographies in accounting research is found in Ahrens and Mollona (2007), \nAhrens (2004, 1997), and Jonsson and Macintosh (1997). For application to the managerial setting, see, for example, \nNoordegraf and Stewart (2000), Reed (1989), Kotter (1982) and Hanaway (1989). \n 30 \nverbal exchanges of information, the incorporation of different types of information that take \nplace.11  \n  \n5. Conclusion \n \nIn this paper I outlined an approach to the study of accounting information and managerial \nwork that explicitly incorporates prior research on how managers work and how they use \naccounting and other forms of information. This approach focuses on the role of accounting \ninformation in developing managers\u2019 knowledge of the work environment, appreciation of how \naccounting information interacts with and relates to other information that managers use, and a \nstronger focus on the ways in which managers use accounting information in verbal \ncommunications and discussions. I examined the implications of this approach for the types of \naccounting information that managers find, or could find, helpful in their work, as well as \nconsideration of how existing research methods could fruitfully be adapted to focus on the detailed \nactivities through which managers engage with accounting information. Although few researchers \nhave heeded Jonsson\u2019s (1998) call to action, this paucity of studies provides much scope for future \nresearch to develop our understanding of how and why managers use accounting information.  \nThe first and most immediate implication of this approach is to broaden the scope of inquiry \ninto what constitutes research on accounting information and managerial work. The approach \nrequires explicit examination of different roles for accounting information in managerial work (e.g., \ndeveloping knowledge of the work environment), of other forms of information and their \ninteraction with accounting information, and of the variety of ways in which accounting \ninformation can be communicated, particularly through verbal discussions. Given criticisms that \naccounting research is too rigid and cautious (Hopwood, 2007), an expanded research focus is \n                                               \n11 For examples of studies that use meetings as an empirical setting, see Boland and Pondy (1986) who examined \nweekly meetings of a high school district\u2019s administrative council, and Jonsson (1998) who examined a top \nmanagement meeting of a city municipal district. For an overview of research on meetings in organizations, see \nJarzabkowski and Seidl (2008). \n 31 \nimportant in encouraging investigations that consider the emergence of new roles and possibilities \nfor accounting, as well as reconsideration of our existing conceptions of what accounting is and is \nused for. A broader scope of inquiry will require much greater engagement with on-going research \nin related fields, such as studies of how managers use information (e.g., Anderson, 2008), research \nthat examines how information is communicated in organizations (e.g., Nelson, 2001), as well as \nstudies of changes to the nature of managerial work itself (e.g., Tengblad, 2006). In addition to \nenriching our own research, a likely benefit of this engagement is increased interest in the outputs \nof accounting research from scholars in other disciplines whose research also seeks to understand \nhow managers use information in organizations. As productive conversations between accounting \nand other researchers have been limited (e.g., Chenhall, 2008), increasing interest is important if \naccounting research and practice is to play a more influential role in management research and \nmanagement more generally.  \n The second implication of this approach is to incorporate a much stronger relative \nperspective to the study of accounting information and managerial work. As argued earlier, much \nmanagement accounting research tends to focus on how managers use accounting information only, \nwhereas studies of what managers do show that they rely on a wide variety of information sources \nin their work. This has important implications for several fields of inquiry in management \naccounting research. For example, when we investigate how the use of accounting information is \ncontingent upon different tasks, structures, cultures and environments (Chenhall, 2003), we should \nalso examine how other sources of information affect the use of accounting information in \nmanagerial work. When we investigate reliance on accounting performance measures (Hartmann, \n2000), we should examine how accounting and other sources of information are used to make \nperformance evaluation judgements. And when we investigate the relationship between accounting \ninformation and strategy, we should examine how accounting and other types of accounts and \nrationalities are used by managers in strategising (e.g., Jorgensen & Messner, 2009). A stronger \nrelative perspective provides researchers with the opportunity to develop theory that focuses more \n 32 \ndirectly on accounting\u2019s potentially unique role in managerial work in comparison to other sources \nof information in organisations. For example, I propose that the translation of operational activities \ninto a single, financial dimension, in comparison to other sources of information, is the most unique \nand helpful feature of accounting information for managerial work. However, the validity of this \nand other expectations about the unique advantages of accounting can only be discovered by \nincorporating an analysis of other sources of information into management accounting studies. In \nthis way, researchers can developed better theories about the potentially unique features of \naccounting information that managers find or could find helpful. \nThe third implication of this approach is to focus more on how managers actually work with \naccounting information and less on its technical characteristics. As argued earlier, many recent \ndevelopments in accounting (e.g., balanced scorecard, causal performance maps, activity-based \ncosting) are directed towards making accounting information a more complete description of \norganizational activities. The approach advanced in this paper, however, indicates that such \ndevelopments are somewhat misplaced as they give inadequate attention to managerial (in contrast \nto accounting) beliefs about the quality and relevance of information. From this perspective, \naccounting information is helpful for managers when it enables them to do things, when it is \nmobilised as a resource for action (Ahrens & Chapman, 2007). This indicates that judgements about \nthe quality and relevance of accounting information should relate primarily to whether it helps \nmanagers to carry out their work and less to whether it adequately describes underlying \norganizational activities. As such, although technical improvements to the design of accounting \ninformation are important, they are somewhat secondary to consideration of how managers draw on \naccounting information to get things done.  \n The fourth and final implication of the approach outlined in this paper is the potential for \nmuch greater engagement between researchers and practitioners. Accounting research, and \nmanagement research more generally, has been criticised for becoming far too removed from the \npractices and activities it seeks to investigate and illuminate (Hopwood, 2007; Johnson, Melin & \n 33 \nWhittington, 2003; Mintzberg, 1982). The specific areas for future investigation as outlined in the \npropositions, as well as a greater focus on process-based experimental studies and micro-practices \nin field studies, are collectively directed at much closer engagement with what managers do (and do \nnot do) with accounting information in their work. Such an approach is likely to increase managers\u2019 \ninterest in the outputs of accounting research as the research agenda more closely matches \u201cthe \nlived worlds of organizational actors\u201d (Johnson et al., 2003: 15).  The approach is also likely to \nincrease the likelihood of managers engaging in the research process itself, whether as subjects in \nprocess-based experiments and\/or as participants in field studies. Furthermore, greater engagement \nwith managers is likely to help researchers to become aware more quickly of changes to the way in \nwhich managers use accounting information, and thus respond more effectively \u201cto the shifting \nnature of the world of practice\u201d (Hopwood, 2007: 1370). In an environment of increasing \ndisconnection between researchers and practitioners, this is important if accounting research is to \ninfluence more strongly the practice of accounting itself. In particular, researchers can develop new \naccounting techniques, and make refinements to existing techniques, based on a more nuanced and \npertinent understanding of how and why managers do and\/or might use accounting information in \ntheir work.  \n \n 34 \nReferences \n \nAbernethy, M.
