Material in the solutionised condition is welded using the Cold Metal Transfer, or CMT\nprocess (with ductile filler alloy) and autogenously using a laser. Grain size is shown to have a\nsignificant effect on cracking. Using the CMT, welding power is shown to have high significance\non the level of cracking, whereas welding speed has little effect. When welding using the laser, it is\nshown that the power and spot size are more crucial to the material cracking than the travel speed. It\nis indicated that the weld bead geometry has high significance over the occurrence of cracking, with\na relationship between welding power, weld bead geometry, and stresses controlling the occurrence\nand magnitude of cracking. Further, some laser welds are analysed after post-weld heat treatment,\nand there is a significant increase in cracking after this. However, 34% of samples contained no\ncracking in both the as-welded and post-weld heat treated state.\nIntroduction\nGas turbines are manufactured with a significant number of key components from superalloys,\nwhich are selected due to their excellent high temperature creep resistance given primarily by the\nprecipitation strengthening by \uf067\u2019 precipitates and carbides, and also their equally excellent\ncorrosion\/oxidation resistance [1,2]. Due to the increasing cost of the material and high cost of\nproducing such components, gas turbine original equipment manufacturers are investigating\nmethods of repairing blades using fusion welding rather than replacement [3]. Unfortunately,\nsuperalloys, like other precipitation-hardening alloys, are susceptible to liquation cracking during\nwelding and strain-age cracking after welding [4]. As a result, weld repairs on these materials often\ncontain cracks so the components do not meet the required specification.\nLiquation cracking is a welding defect that occurs in the heat-affected-zone (HAZ) of welds\nproduced on superalloys, generally nucleating at the fusion boundary and propagating towards the\nbase material. They are intergranular by nature and form along the grain boundaries. It has\nbeen reported [5] that liquation occurs by either:\n\uf0b7 The constitutional liquation of secondary phase particles, or\n\uf0b7 The segregation of melting point suppressant elements on grain boundaries during\nsolidification of castings and subsequent thermal processing prior to welding\nThere has been significant research into liquation microfissuring in the alloy [6,7] which is\nconsidered one of the most HAZ crack susceptible superalloys. This work primarily focuses on\ndetermining the phases which form in the liquid film which cracks, with other work focusing on the\neffects of filler alloy composition [8,9]. In addition, it has been reported that the level of liquation\ncracking in an alloy is affected by the level of liquation, the grain structure (a coarser grain size\nleads to greater segregation of elements on grain boundaries), the ductility of the alloy (and\ntherefore how the alloy resists the welding stresses) and the level of heat input (resulting in greater\nHAZ size and therefore greater area of liquation).\nThe alloy of interest in this research is Rene 80, an alloy of similar composition to IN738 and\nalso considered very susceptible to HAZ cracking and difficult to weld. The mechanism of liquation\nin this alloy has been reported previously [10] and found to be due the liquation of MC type\ncarbides in a solutionised condition pre-weld, MC type carbides and \uf067\/\uf067\u2019 eutectic islands in an as-\ncast condition, and MC-type carbides and borides in an overaged condition. However, the\nsolutionised condition had the lowest level of liquation due to reduced segregation of this phase.\nIn this work, liquation cracking has been investigated on the Rene 80 superalloy using the CMT\nwelding process [11]. In addition, autogenous laser bead on plate welds have been performed on the\nsame alloy to investigate the effects of different heat inputs on liquation cracking.\nExperimental procedure\nDuring the first stage of the experiments, a Fronius 3200 CMT power source is used, together\nwith 1.6mm IN625 filler alloy. Chemical analysis was performed to find the composition of the\nalloy, and is shown in table 1 for the 0.7mm and 1.71mm batch. See Table 1 for details of the\nchemical composition of the filler alloy IN625 used in the CMT experiments only. The parameters\napplied are outlined in table 2. Two different grain sizes were used for the CMT work to test the\ngrain size effect, these are 3.5mm and 4.9mm average diameter.\nFor the second stage of the results reported, an IPG YLR-8000 high power fibre laser is used.\nThis is an Yb doped fibre, operating an emission wavelength of 1070nm with a spot focus diameter\nof 0.64mm and a maximum power output of 8kW. The beam is delivered through a fibre optics\nsystem to a Precitec YW50 process head with a collimating focal length of 125mm and a beam\nfocal length of 250mm. The process head is mounted on a Fanuc M-170iB\/45T robot.\nTable 1 Chemical compositions (typical values) of base material and filler alloy (in %)\nMaterial Cr Co Mo W Al Ti C B Ni\nRene 80 14 9 4 4 3 4.7 0.16 0.015 Bal\nIN 625 23 1 10 - 0.4 0.4 0.1 - Bal\nThe material used for the laser trials was supplied in two batches, the first batch used for the 0.7\nand 1.71mm spot size welds and the post-weld heat treated analysis, and the second for the 2.5 and\n5.0 mm welds. Therefore this is considered when analyzing the results. The average grain diameter\nof the material used in these welds is the 3.5mm size. Four different spot sizes are used; they are\n0.7, 1.71 2.5 and 5.0 mm. Also, a range of travel speeds from 50mm\/min up to 4000mm\/min are\nused to increase the heat input ranges further. Further, the welds performed using the 0.7 and 1.71\nmm spot sizes are also treated with the standard post-weld solution heat treatment for this material.\nPrior to welding, the 22mm thick cast blocks of material are solutionised and then cleaned using\na wire brush followed by wiping with acetone. After welding, the samples were sectioned transverse\nto the weld direction and ground and polished using standard metallographic procedures, with the\nsamples then etched using a Kalling\u2019s waterless reagent (2g CuCl2, 40ml HCl and 80ml methanol).\nThe microstructures are then analysed on a Nikon Optiphot microscope, and weld macros are taken\nusing a Nikon Prysm system. All weld geometries and crack lengths are measured using Carl Zeiss\nAxiovision\u00ae software.\nTable 2 \u2013 Summary of parameters applied in this investigation\nCMT CMT Pulse mix Laser\nShielding gas: Ar + 2.5% CO2 Shielding gas: Ar + 2.5% CO2 High purity Ar\nPower (W): 2567 - 3416 (4) Power(W): 2272 - 5452 (9 ) Power kW: 0.4 - 8 (16)\nTravel speeds (m\/min) - 0.4 and 0.6 Travel speed(m\/min): 0.3 and 0.5 Travel speed mm\/min: 50 - 4000 (11 )\nWire feed speed (m\/min) - 6 and 6.5 Pulses: 10 and 30 Spot sizes (mm): 0.7, 1.7, 2.5 and 5.0\nCMTs: 1 and 5\nTime at base (ms) 2 and 4\nThe laser results are analysed using the historical data function in Design Expert 7.1, due to\ndifficulty in interpreting the results due to large amount of scatter in the data.

A second analysis was performed without the transform\napplied which indicated some effect of the travel speed, with the effect being smaller at low powers\nthan high powers. Figure 2a shows that with small spot sizes, the power has a significant effect on\nthe cracking, whist at larger spot sizes the effect is negligible.\nFigures 3a and 3b illustrate the distribution of the cracking after the post-weld heat treatment\n(PWHT) was applied to the TCL data from the 0.7mm and 1.71mm spot sizes only. Firstly, the\ndifference after the heat treatment in cracking is shown in figure 3a. Clearly, there are a significant\nnumber of samples which showed a change in cracking after the heat treatment, with 1\/3rd of all\nsamples containing no cracks in both the as-welded and post-weld heat treated state. Figure 3b\nshows how the samples were divided into four categories: no cracking before and after heat\ntreatment, no cracking before but cracking afterwards, a reduction in cracking after the heat\ntreatment, and finally an increase in cracking (where there was cracking already).\nDiscussion\nIt is clear from figure 1a that for the CMT process, power has a significant effect on the ACL, for\nboth grain sizes. This is as a result of greater energy being input, causing both a greater region of\narea susceptible to liquation, but also having an impact on the weld bead geometries and the stresses\nwithin it. It is also clear from both figures 1a and 1b, that there is a significant effect of the material\ny'\ngrain size. The larger grain sized material shows more cracking which is as expected, and is a result\nof the lower ductility, and also likely increased segregation of liquating phases.\nFigure 2 illustrates the difference in the significance of both power and spot size on the cracking.\nAt lower spot sizes, the power has high significance, which is due to higher intensities causing the\nweld bead geometry to have significantly higher penetration, often with narrower welds. At the\nlarger spot sizes, the power has less of significance, with higher power welds having very little\ncracking, whereas there is actually slightly more cracking with the low powers. The weld bead\ngeometries under these parameters are very wide but shallow. The geometries of the weld beads at\nboth the low power small spot size, and high power large spot size parameters are very similar; of\nalmost uniform penetration and width. This indicates that there is an optimum weld bead geometry\nfor which cracking will be minimised\nAnother noteworthy finding from this plot is the optimum value of spot size yielding the lowest\ncracking at approximately 2.5 to 3mm. This finding however maybe the result of either a material\ndifference, or processing. For instance, the same pre-welding preparation \u2013 such as shot blasting,\nwire-brushing and wiping was applied to all material- but there may be an irregularity in any one of\nthese steps that were applied to the blocks on which the 2.5mm welds are performed. It is believed\nthat this is the less likely of the two explanations, and that it is more likely a difference in materials\ncomposition or material microstructure \u2013 such as being more homogenous and containing less\nsegregation.\nNevertheless if this optimum value of spot size is correct, then this confirms that there may be a\nsignificance in the weld bead geometry having effects on the levels of cracking in the welds, with\nwelds that are of very similar penetration to width having no cracking, but welds which have either\nsignificantly greater penetration than width, or vice versa, showing higher cracking.\nThis then suggests that there is a relationship between welding processes, weld bead geometry,\nand stresses on the cracking. As a result, a point of interest for further work is to model the stresses\ndeveloped in the different weld bead profiles and understand further their role in the occurrence of\ncracking.\nThe inverse square root which is applied to the welding speed data acts to condense the cracked\ndata, particularly where significant cracking has occurred. For example figure 4 shows very little\nchange in the transformed value occurred for ACL values between 200 and 700. Therefore the\ntransform helps to show where cracking does and does not occur.\nThe welding speed for both processes (figure 1b and 2b) showed little or no effect on the\ncracking, which is an interesting finding. The welding speed is likely to influence the extent of\nliquation. For example low speeds will increase the conductive heat transfer into the material and\nthe amount of grain boundary melting. Both CMT and laser results have indicated negligible effect\nof the travel speed and therefore the extent of the liquation. Hence as discussed previously cracking\nis likely to be affected more by the stresses generated and the shape of the weld bead rather than the\nextent of the liquation.\nNote however, that a small effect of travel speed was observed when the transformation was not\nused. As mentioned previously the transform compresses the data where cracking has occurred.\nTherefore where cracking occurs, the size of the cracks is increased by reducing the travel speed.\nAfter the post-weld heat treatment is applied, there is a significant increase in the cracking found\nin the measured samples. It should firstly be illustrated that the total crack length (TCL) values are\nused rather than the ACL, because the ACL showed a reduction in cracking caused by the\nnucleation of smaller cracks, which increased the total number of cracks. As a result, the TCL\nshowed more accurately the change in cracking caused by this heat treatment. The increase in\ncracking is caused by the nucleation of new cracks via the strain-ageing mechanism, as well as the\npropagation of existing cracks.\nFigure 3a shows that as power is increased; the total amount of cracking after the heat treatment\nincreases significantly, whereas at lower powers this change is not as dramatic. Also, where there is\nno cracking before, there is a significant chance that there will be no cracking afterwards. In fact, as\nshown by figure 3b, there is a 34.5% chance of this statement occurring. In total, there is a 61% (35\/\n(35+22)) chance of a weld containing no cracks after post-weld heat treatment if it has contained no\ncracking in the as-welded state, However, 20% of all samples showed a reduction in TCL after the\nheat treatment, which is quite an interesting result, although it should be remember that there was a\nlarge amount of scatter in the results.\nConclusions\nWhen welding nickel-based superalloys, cracking occurs through liquation, and after welding via\nstrain-age cracking. The welding power has significance on both the occurrence and magnitude of\ncracking, with low powers minimising cracking with a small spot size and high powers minimising\ncracking with a large spot size, which indicates that the weld bead geometry has an effect on the\noccurrence of cracking. There is an optimum value of spot size at approximately 2.5 to 3.0mm\nwhere cracking is minimized. The effects of welding speed are shown to be negligible for both\nprocesses. This is an interesting result as it indicates it is not necessary to weld at higher travel\nspeeds. It is shown that the key relationship between welding power, geometry of weld bead, and\nstresses with the cracking is important and future work will investigate this relationship, utilizing\nmodelling and residual stress measurements.\nPost-weld heat treatment is shown to have a substantial increase in cracking, as a result of the\nnucleation of cracks and the propagation of existing ones. It is shown that 35% of welds had no\ncracking before and after the heat treatment was applied to the welds, and that there is a 61%\nchange of no cracking occurring in a sample after post-weld heat treatment if the sample contains\nno cracking in the as welded condition.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the support of Doncasters Precision Castings Deritend, part of the\nDoncasters Group Plc for the financial support given to the project which this work is part of.
