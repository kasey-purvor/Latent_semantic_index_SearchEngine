In Experiment 1, 4-to 6-year-olds more frequently marked both doors from \nwhich a block might emerge when the outcome was undetermined, than when the block \nwas hidden behind one door. In Experiment 2 (5-to 6- year-olds) and 3 (5-to 8- year-\nolds), children more frequently placed food in both possible locations when an imaginary \npet was yet to be placed in a box, than when it was hidden in one. Results have \nimplications for interpretive theory of mind and \u2018curse of knowledge\u2019.  \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n3\n \nChildren's Sensitivity to Their Own Relative Ignorance:  \nHandling of Possibilities Under Conditions of Epistemic and Physical Uncertainty \n \nAdults' and children's handling or mishandling of uncertainty have long been the \nfocus of research attention. In the adult literature, a number of researchers have made a \ndistinction between uncertainty which arises in the external world (for example about the \nfall of a die not yet thrown), and uncertainty which resides internally due to ignorance on \nthe part of the observer (for example about the fall of a die which has been thrown but out \nof the observer's view). The latter is commonly labeled epistemic uncertainty; the former \nhas been given various labels and here we shall use the term physical uncertainty. In the \nexperiments reported here we compare children's handling of these two types of \nuncertainty and show that, as for adults, the variable is of psychological importance: \nExactly the same probability is treated differently when uncertainty is epistemic rather \nthan physical. In our tasks with children, however, the effect operates in the opposite \ndirection from that found in the adult studies, and we speculate why.  \nIn what follows we begin by summarizing the published research on children's \nhandling of uncertainty, most of which involves procedures giving rise to epistemic \nrather than physical uncertainty. Then we show how adults respond differently to the two \ntypes of uncertainty in tasks unlike those used with children. Finally we set up our \npredictions for children's handling of the two types of uncertainty in tasks which derive \nfrom the existing developmental literature.  \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n4\nChildren have a well documented tendency to under-estimate the uncertainty \narising from limited information in a wide range of circumstances, to a much greater \nextent than adults. The literature on children's understanding of ambiguity highlights \nchanges between around 5 and 8 years in children's acceptance of the possibility of \nalternative interpretations of limited input (e.g. Beal, 1988; Flavell, Speer, Green & \nAugust, 1981; Robinson & Robinson, 1982; Robinson, Goelman & Olson, 1983;  Taylor, \n1988), and this has been supplemented by more recent studies (Apperly & Robinson, \n1998; Beck & Robinson, 2001; Carpendale & Chandler, 1996).  Research on children's \nreadiness to make undecidability judgements in reasoning problems gives results \nconsistent with the work on ambiguity (e.g. Braine & Rumaine, 1983; Fay & Klahr, \n1996; Klahr & Chen, 2003; Pieraut-le-Bonniec, 1980). By around 7 to 8 years many \nchildren demonstrate in various ways that they are aware that visual or oral input can be \nambiguous, that a viewer or listener could make the wrong interpretation or would not \nknow the correct interpretation, and that two viewers or listeners might legitimately make \ndifferent interpretations.  Younger children, in contrast, tend to make a single \ninterpretation of information which affords more than one interpretation, tend to judge \nthat they or another person knows the true interpretation when a judgement of 'don't \nknow' would be appropriate, and tend to judge that limited oral or visual input tells or \nshows them enough to identify the correct referent. \nOn the other hand,  4- to 5- year olds are not completely insensitive to the \ndistinction between informative and uninformative or partially informative information: \nThey may hesitate prior to interpreting limited information (Plummert, 1996); they \nappropriately revise incorrect interpretations in the light of further clarifying information \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n5\n(Beck & Robinson, 2001), and they recognize when they have gained sufficient \ninformation to identify a referent uniquely even though they respond inappropriately to \ninsufficient information (Beck, Robinson & Freeth, 2005). \nIn all the tasks used in the studies cited above, uncertainty arises only because \ninformation is withheld from the participant, information to which he or she could in \nprinciple have access. For example in Klahr & Chen (2003) the experimenter made an \nobject behind a screen so the child could not see which of a set of boxes was used, and \nchildren judged whether they \"knew for sure\" or could \"only guess\" which box had been \nused. Similarly, in referential communication tasks, the speaker has a particular intended \nmeaning in mind and has typically chosen a real referent which is hidden from the child \nlistener (e.g. Apperly & Robinson, 1998).  \nIn a study of logical reasoning amongst 4- and 6- year-olds, Sophian and \nSomerville (1988) devised a game which was the inspiration for our procedures in the \nexperiments to be reported. In Sophian and Somerville's (1988) game, a toy was hidden \nin one of several possible cups which were suspended in a rack above the table. The \nexperimenter's hand moved across the cups in various sequences which either allowed the \nchild to infer exactly where the toy was, or to narrow down the possibilities to two, three \nor four of the cups. Children's task was to place mats on the table where necessary to \ncushion the fall of the toy from the cup. Hence in this procedure, the toy was already in \nplace, the experimenter knew which cup it was in, and it was only the child's limited \nperspective which gave rise to her uncertainty. The 4-year-olds as a group showed some \nsensitivity to uncertainty by placing more mats when there were more logically possible \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n6\nlocations for the toy, but even the 6-year-olds' performance was quite poor with only a \nquarter of them doing this reliably.  \nStudies in which children are subject to physical uncertainty are rare. Gopnik and \nRosati's (2001) report of 4- to 5- year-olds' ability to report reversals of the duck-rabbit \nambiguous figure is relevant, although in this case there is no one true reality about which \nthe child is ignorant. Another study in which children were exposed to physical, as \nopposed to epistemic, uncertainty is reported by Beck, Robinson, Carroll and Apperly \n(2005). The focus of this research was on children's counterfactual and future \nhypothetical reasoning, but a task was included in which chance determined whether a \ntoy mouse would emerge from one of two possible outlets of a slide. Children placed \nmats to catch the mouse as in Sophian and Somerville's (1988) task described above. In \nBeck et al\u2019s (2005) game, however, at the time the child put mats in place it was still \nundetermined which way the mouse would fall: Uncertainty resided in the physical world \nand not just in the child's mind. Under these conditions, in this study, 3- and 4- year-old \nchildren spontaneously put out two mats on around one third of trials and 5- and 6- year-\nolds did so on two thirds. We cannot validly make a comparison with the very different \nstudy by Sophian and Somerville (1988) mentioned above, but the results are at least \nconsistent with the possibility that children find it easier to specify possibilities under \nconditions of physical than epistemic uncertainty. In the experiments reported below we \nmake comparisons under matched conditions.  \nWe now consider the adult literature in which the two types of uncertainty have \nbeen compared by researchers interested in an apparently illogical difference in people's \nwillingness to bet on uncertainties which are objectively identical, and its implications for \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n7\ntheories of decision making (e.g. Kahneman & Tversky, 1982). To return to the examples \nat the beginning, of a die yet to be thrown as contrasted with a die already thrown but \nhidden: Rothbart and Snyder (1970) asked undergraduates to place bets on their guessed \noutcome under these two conditions, and to indicate their confidence. Participants betting \non a prediction (before they had thrown the die) bet more of the 10 pennies they had been \ngiven (median 5 pennies), and felt greater confidence in the correctness of their guess, \nthan participants betting on a postdiction (after they had thrown the die, median 3 \npennies). Although the probability of success is identical in the two conditions, \nparticipants bet more money when uncertainty was physical rather than epistemic. \nRothbart and Snyder (1970) interpreted their results in terms of magical thinking: The \nprediction might magically have influenced the subsequent outcome.  \nHowever, similar findings occur when an illusion of magical influence seems \nimplausible, for example a preference for betting on the rise or fall of a stock from \ntomorrow's Wall Street Journal rather than yesterday's (Heath & Tversky, 1991). Heath \nand Tversky (1991) present a series of experiments in support of their 'competence' \nhypothesis according to which under conditions of equal probability, people prefer to bet \nin a context in which they consider themselves competent or knowledgeable. People have \nthis preference, these authors argue, because competence allows people to claim credit \nwhen they are right and its absence exposes people to blame when they are wrong. Of \nparticular relevance to our experiments reported below is the suggestion by Heath and \nTversky (1991) that people feel particularly incompetent, and so are particularly averse to \nbetting, when the outcome is knowable in principle but unknown to them, that is with \nepistemic as opposed to physical uncertainty.  \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n8\nA final relevant study of adults' betting under uncertainty is by Chow and Sarin \n(2002) who report two experiments comparing participants' willingness to bet when they \ndid not know the probability of success but the experimenter did, and when nobody \nknew. The mean amount of money participants were prepared to bet was higher when \nnobody knew the probability of success than when the experimenter knew.  These authors \ninterpret their results in terms of a 'comparative ignorance' hypothesis put forward by Fox \nand Tversky (1995): When people assume that information is available to others but not \nto them they are particularly intolerant of uncertainty, and when people assume \ninformation is unavailable to all, they are less intolerant. Chow and Sarin point out the \nsubjective element in this classification of unknown vs unknowable information. For \nexample, a lay person might assume that risks of death from certain causes are \nunknowable, whereas an actuary might know that probabilistic information is available \nand so might see themselves as relatively ignorant. \nWhatever the explanation for the results with adult participants, their sensitivity to \nepistemic vs physical uncertainty is robust over a range of contexts. The implication of \ninterest to us here is that people spontaneously represent their own perspective of \nignorance vis a vis the more knowledgeable perspective of others or vis a vis their own \npossible perspective of knowledge, even when this is completely irrelevant to the task in \nhand. This raises an interesting developmental question: What might be the course of \ndevelopment of sensitivity to epistemic vs physical uncertainty?  \nThe literatures on children\u2019s handling of undecidability and ambiguity, \nsummarized above, form one basis for making a prediction. According to these \nliteratures, young children up to the age of around 7 years are particularly inclined to \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n9\nmake a single interpretation of limited information when it would be more appropriate to \nhedge their bets. At first sight, children's making of a single interpretation might be \nconstrued as similar to adults' willingness to place a bet under conditions of uncertainty, \nand children's acknowledgment of possibilities might be equated to adults' unwillingness \nto place a bet. If we draw this parallel, then on the basis of the adult literature reported \nabove (adults bet higher amounts under conditions of physical than epistemic \nuncertainty) we would predict that insofar as children are sensitive to the distinction \nbetween physical and epistemic uncertainty, they will be more inclined to make a single \ninterpretation (place a bet) under conditions of physical uncertainty, and more willing to \nspecify possibilities (hedge their bets) under conditions of epistemic uncertainty. We \nlabel this Prediction 1. \nHowever, drawing this parallel with the adult literature rests on either of two \npossible underlying assumptions which need to be explored before Prediction 1 can be \ndeemed valid. One is that both children and adults, faced with uncertainty of outcome, \nignore the fact that any particular outcome is uncertain and ignore other possibilities. We \nargue below this may well be the case for children faced with ambiguous input. For \nadults betting on an uncertain outcome, however, we can reject this characterization. The \nresults of Rothbart and Snyder (1970), for example, show that although adults were more \nconfident of the correctness of their prediction than their postdiction, they were still far \nfrom \u2018completely confident\u2019, implying awareness of the alternative possibility.  \nThe alternative possible assumption underlying Prediction 1 is that, like adults in \nthe betting task, children who make a single interpretation of limited information when \nthey have the opportunity to acknowledge both possibilities, do really recognize both. For \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n10\nsome reason they choose to guess. This is plausible. Researchers of children\u2019s referential \ncommunication skills have pointed out that children may assume that speakers will \nprovide clear, unambiguous messages which permit a single interpretation, and so are \nbiased to make such an interpretation (e.g. Ackerman, 1981; Speer, 1984). Similar \narguments are made in the literature on children\u2019s handling of undecidability (e.g. \nAcredolo & Horobin, 1987). It is also plausible that certain task conditions increase the \nlikelihood that children will guess rather than hedge their bets, for example when the \nexperimenter appears to expect them to make a single interpretation. It is not obvious \nwhy physical rather than epistemic uncertainty should prompt children to guess, but it is \nan empirical possibility that it does.  \nTo summarize: If children who make a single interpretation when they have the \nopportunity to indicate possibilities are simply subject to a performative bias, and are \nreally aware of  alternative possibilities, then it seems appropriate to draw a parallel \nbetween adults\u2019 level of betting and children\u2019s making of single versus multiple \ninterpretations. On this basis we can make Prediction 1: Insofar as children are sensitive \nto the distinction between physical and epistemic uncertainty, they will be more likely to \nmake a single interpretation under physical uncertainty and more likely to acknowledge \npossibilities under epistemic uncertainty.  \nOn the other hand, many researchers into children\u2019s handling of ambiguity and \nundecidability argue that making a single interpretation is not due only to a guessing bias. \nRather, children can also suffer from a genuine inability to handle more than one possible \noutcome of a single event: The characterization which we rejected above for adults. For \nexample, under conditions of epistemic uncertainty as used in the published literature, \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n11\nchildren younger than around 7 years do not just make single interpretations of limited \ninput but also evaluate the input as adequate (e.g. Beal & Flavell, 1982; Flavell, Speer, \nGreen, & August, 1981; Robinson & Apperly, 2001; Robinson & Whittaker, 1987). They \nfail to explain why different people can make different interpretations of limited input \n(Carpendale & Chandler, 1996; Chandler, Hallet, & Sokol, 2002). These results suggest \nthat the representational demands of holding alternative possibilities in mind are just too \nhigh for younger children (at least with epistemic uncertainty as investigated so far), and \nthey use the representationally less demanding response of making a single interpretation, \ndespite having initially noticed the alternative possibilities. \nThis line of argument leads us to make the opposite prediction, which we label \nPrediction 2: If the context encourages children to represent their own perspective of \nrelative ignorance, the cognitive demands of so doing will make them more likely to \nrespond in a representationally less demanding way to uncertainty, namely by making a \nsingle interpretation rather than by specifying possibilities. Conversely, when the child is \nin a position of physical uncertainty, with no additional representational demands, she \nwill be most likely to make the demanding response of specifying possibilities rather than \nmaking a single interpretation. That is, insofar as children are sensitive to the distinction \nbetween epistemic and physical uncertainty, they will be more likely to specify \npossibilities under conditions of physical than epistemic uncertainty (Prediction 2). \n Yet a third possibility, Prediction 3, is that children aged around 4 to 8 years, that \nis within the age range covered by the developmental literature summarized above, are \ninsensitive to the variable of epistemic vs physical uncertainty and will be equally \ninclined or disinclined to specify possibilities in both types of circumstance. If this is the \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n12\ncase, then the developmental question will remain open, since it is clear that at some \npoint on the route to adulthood, sensitivity does appear. \nThere is good reason to expect sensitivity to appear relatively late in development. \nSince Piaget (1926) examined children's egocentrism we have known that children are \nmuch less likely than adults to take into account differences between their own and other \npeople's knowledge when it is important to do so. Adults are certainly not immune to \nerrors of perspective taking (e.g. Birch & Bloom, 2003; Keysar, Barr, Balin & Brauner, \n2000; Keysar & Henly, 2002; Keysar, Lin & Bar, 2003; Mitchell, Robinson, Isaacs & \nNye, 1996), and under some conditions very young children do show sensitivity to \nknowledge differences (e.g. Baldwin & Moses, 1994; Baldwin et al., 1996; O'Neill & \nTopolovec, 2001). Nevertheless there is no doubt that children show a much greater \ndifficulty than adults. Failure or inability to take into account another person's lesser \nknowledge appears to play an important role in, for example, children's failure to \nacknowledge others' false beliefs (e.g. Wimmer & Perner, 1983), in failures to \ncommunicate effectively (e.g. Asher & Wigfield, 1981;Whitehurst & Sonnenschein, \n1981), and in failures to predict what knowledge another person will gain from limited \ninformation (e.g. Taylor, 1988).  \nIn all the above tasks, child participants are at risk of ignoring the fact that they \nknow something relevant about which another person is ignorant. In the circumstances \nwe are interested in here, in contrast (when we know that adults unnecessarily represent \nirrelevant knowledge differences), the child is ignorant of something which they could \nknow, and it is task irrelevant whether or not the child\u2019s ignorance is shared. Surely we \nmight expect it to be relatively late in development that children spontaneously represent \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n13\nirrelevant knowledge differences? We might also expect it to be more difficult to take \ninto account differences in perspective when the child is in the position of ignorance \nrather than knowledge, since there is no content to represent when one doesn\u2019t know \nsomething. Birch and Bloom (2003), who argue that children have difficulty inhibiting \nthe content of their own knowledge base when it would be appropriate to do so in a \nperspective-taking task, also argue that there is no equivalent \u2018curse of ignorance\u2019 since \nthere is nothing to inhibit when one is ignorant. There are several grounds, then, for \nexpecting that sensitivity to the difference between physical and epistemic uncertainty \nwould be a relatively late development, emerging well after the age of 4-5 years when \nchildren come to acknowledge false belief, and probably after 7-8 years when they come \nto acknowledge different interpretations of ambiguous input.  \n  We report three experiments to test our three predictions. In all three experiments \nchildren were asked to specify possibilities under conditions of certainty (a single \noutcome could be predicted with confidence) and uncertainty (two outcomes were \nequally likely). As in Sophian and Somerville's (1988) task, and in Beck et al (2005), \nchildren placed a physical marker to indicate the possible outcomes, for example mats to \ncatch a falling block in Experiment 1, or food to keep a hidden pet in good health in \nExperiment 2. By asking children to specify possibilities we avoided any superficial bias \nagainst admitting \"don't know\": Children showed what they did know on the basis of the \nlimited information available. On the other hand, by asking children to place two physical \nmarkers for a single event, we imposed a strict criterion of simultaneous rather than \nsuccessive consideration of possibilities.  \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n14\nIn each experiment we compared children's responses under conditions of \nphysical and epistemic uncertainty. Did they respond differently under the two \nconditions, indicating sensitivity to their own relative ignorance (contra Prediction 3)? If \nso, were the findings in line with Prediction 1 or Prediction 2? That is, do children show \nthe same direction of difference as adults, or the opposite?  \nWe aimed to minimize any general bias towards guessing when there were two \npossible outcomes. In Experiment 1 we encouraged (and children enjoyed) successful \ncatching of a block. In Experiments 2 and 3, children risked an imaginary pet going \nhungry if they guessed which of two containers it might be in. However, if there was any \nresidual general bias towards guessing, then the matching of tasks ensured that this was \nthe same under conditions of epistemic and physical uncertainty. \nExperiment 1 \n We compared children's responses to physical uncertainty (on unknowable trials), \nwhen it was as yet undetermined which of two outcomes would happen, with their \nresponses to epistemic uncertainty (on unknown trials), when the experimenter knew \nwhat would happen but the child did not because the relevant clue was hidden from view. \nMethod \nParticipants. There were 29 younger children (12 girls) aged 4;5 \u2013 5;4, M age = \n4;11, and 30 older children (14 girls) aged 5;5 \u2013 6;4, M = 5;11, from a middle class \nnursery in Birmingham UK, who had English as their first language.  \nMaterials. We used a box whose front wall was approximately 40 cm square, and \nwhich bore three vertical stripes colored orange, black and green. Three doors were cut in \nthe top of this wall, one in each stripe. Behind the doors was a horizontal shelf, wide \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n15\nenough to hold a small plastic building block, invisible when the box was viewed from \nthe front. In addition we used two trays approx. 10cm x 10cm, lined with cotton wool, \neach of which could be placed at ground level beneath one of the doors. Two tall stiff \npaper bags (of the kind used to hold gift wine bottles), one colored orange and green and \nthe other black, were used to hold plastic building blocks. The tall narrow shape of the \nbags meant that when the experimenter put an arm in one, neither he nor the child could \nsee which block was being picked. The orange and green bag contained 10 orange and 10 \ngreen blocks, and the black bag contained 10 black blocks. Two blue blocks were used \nfor the warm-up trials.  \nProcedure. The child was shown the box with the shelf and the doors, and asked \nto name the colors of the three stripes. The experimenter (D. Carroll) then showed the \ntwo bags with their building block contents, and the child identified the colors and noted \nthe match between the colors of the bags and their block contents. On warm up trials the \nchild was shown how to place a tray beneath a door to catch a block, was shown and told \nthat a block always came through its matching door, and was explicitly shown and told \nthat when she did not know which of two doors the block was behind she needed to place \ntwo trays to catch the block.    \nEach child then had four experimental trials, on two of which it was necessary to \nput out two trays (reality unknown and reality unknowable trials), and on two of which it \nwas sufficient to put out one tray (shown and black trials). On unknowable trials the \nexperimenter said he was going pick a block out of the orange and green bag, but before \nhe picked it the child was asked to put out trays to make sure the block was caught. \n\u2018Trays\u2019 in the plural was used so that if anything we biased children to place two trays \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n16\nrather than a single one. A child who put out only one tray was prompted \u201cCould it (the \nblock) go anywhere else?\u201d and was allowed to add or move a tray if she wished. The \nexperimenter then pushed the block through the door and commented that the child had \nor hadn\u2019t caught it.   \nOn unknown trials the procedure was similar, except that the experimenter picked \na block from the green and orange bag before the child put out trays, looked at the block \nand placed it on the ledge behind the matching door without letting the child see, and \nonly then asked the child to place trays, with a prompt as on unknowable trials if \nnecessary. When the experimenter placed the block on the ledge he moved his hand \nbehind all three doors so that the child could not infer by watching his hand where the \nblock was.  \nOn shown and black trials it was sufficient to place one tray, since the child could \npredict exactly which door the block would come through. On shown trials the \nexperimenter said he would take a block from the orange and green bag, did so, and \nshowed it to the child. Then he placed it on the shelf behind the appropriate door. The \nchild was invited to put out trays. On black trials the experimenter said he was going to \ntake a block from the black bag, and asked the child to put out trays before he put his arm \nin the bag. Hence the shown trials were similar to reality unknown in that the block was \nin place before the child placed trays. The black trials were similar to the reality \nunknowable trials in that the child placed trays before the block was taken from its bag.    \nEach child had one trial of each type (unknown, unknowable, shown, black), \npresented in 4 predetermined orders. Constraints on the orders were that the pattern of \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n17\nsufficient tray placements was 1, 2, 2, 1 or 2, 1, 1, 2. The four orders were: Unknowable \n(L), Black (B), Shown (S), Unknown (N); NSBL; SLNB; BNLS.  \nResults and Discussion \nOn each trial children received a score of 1 if they spontaneously put out the \nsufficient number of trays in the correct location (1 on shown and black trials, 2 on \nunknown and unknowable trials), and a score of 0 if they did not (strict coding).  \nA second, lenient scoring system included responses following any prompt on \ndetermined and undetermined trials: Children gained a score of 1 if they passed under the \nstrict coding above, or if they added a second tray appropriately after the prompt so that \nboth doors were then covered.   \nWe began by examining performance across the four types of trial to judge \nwhether children treated the game as intended. Table 1 shows the frequencies of scores \nfor each trial type. As shown in Table 1, children nearly always put out only one tray \n(gaining a pass) on shown trials when that was sufficient because they had seen the \norange or green block before it was placed on the shelf behind the matching door. On \nblack trials, when the child had not seen the block but could infer that it was black, there \nwere 10 occasions when the child placed a tray under the black door and unnecessarily \nbut not wrongly placed a second tray under another door (perhaps because they were \ninvited to place \u2018trays\u2019 rather than \u2018a tray\u2019). On one trial a child wrongly failed to place a \ntray under the black door. Despite these responses, and despite the biasing prompt, on the \ngreat majority of trials children placed only one tray when that was sufficient to ensure \nthat they caught the block.   \n- - - - - -  \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n18\nInsert Table 1 near here \n- - - - - - \n We can therefore go on to examine performance on trials when one tray was not \nsufficient: Unknown and unknowable trials. On both these trial types the child knew only \nthat the block was either orange or green. On unknowable trials the particular block was \nyet to be chosen when the child placed trays, and on unknown trials the block was \nalready in place on the shelf but hidden from the child. We compared performance on \nthese trials using McNemar tests. Using the strict coding, 9 4-5 year olds passed the \nunknowable trial but not the unknown trial, and 1 showed the opposite pattern. This \ndifference was significant, N=31, p=0.021. The same significant difference was found for \nthe 5-6 year olds: 14 children passed unknowable but not unknown and 1 shown the \nopposite pattern N=30, p=0.001. The difference between trials remained for the younger \ngroup when the liberal coding was used, 7 children passing unknowable but not \nunknown, none showed the opposite pattern, N=31, p=0.016, but failed to reach \nsignificance for the older group, although the pattern was the same. 9 children passed \nunknowable and not unknown, 2 showed the opposite pattern, N=30, p=0.065. Age \ndifferences were not significant: Children in both age groups showed good performance \non the unknowable trials, but performed relatively poorly on the unknown trials. \nChildren more readily realized that one tray was insufficient when a block was yet to \nbe selected, than when one was already in place behind one of the doors. Even the 4- to \n5-year-olds were able to cover both possibilities on unknowable trials, but even 5- to 6-\nyear-olds often failed to do so on unknown trials. This pattern of results goes against \nPredictions 1 and 3, but is in line with Prediction 2. According to Prediction 2, children \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n19\nthis age do attempt spontaneously to represent their own position of ignorance under \nconditions of epistemic uncertainty, this is representationally demanding for them, and so \nthey use a less mature response of making a single interpretation. Under conditions of \nphysical uncertainty there are no additional representational demands and children can \nacknowledge both possibilities.    \nExperiment 2  \n In this experiment we again investigated children\u2019s willingness to acknowledge \nsimultaneously two possible outcomes of a single event, but this time the children acted \non behalf of another who shared their own state of ignorance. One possibility is that in \nExperiment 1, even though children did not have to make a \"don't know\" judgment, they \nwere unwilling to admit their own uncertainty by placing two physical markers for a \nsingle event. If so, acting on behalf of somebody else should minimize any bias of this \nkind. We again compared children\u2019s judgments under two conditions. In one, similar but \nnot identical to the reality unknown trials in Experiment 1, the event in question had \nalready happened: An imaginary pet was in one of two boxes but neither child nor story \nprotagonist knew which. In the second condition, similar but not identical to the reality \nunknowable trials in Experiment 1, the event in question was yet to happen: An \nimaginary pet was not yet in either box. We were interested in whether or not children \nfound it more difficult to acknowledge the two possibilities when the pet was already in \none of the boxes.   \nIn Experiment 1 the contrast between the reality unknown and reality unknowable \ntrials was objectively clear-cut, although we did not know in advance whether children \nwould represent the two trial types differently. The observed difference in difficulty \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n20\nsuggests that they did. In Experiment 2, the situation was less clear-cut.  On all \nexperimental trials the experimenter read out an ambiguous message which had two \npossible interpretations. Presumably the writer of the message knew the intended \nmeaning and on those grounds children might represent the situation as one in which \nreality was unknown rather than unknowable, uncertainty epistemic rather than physical. \nOn the other hand, the writer of the message was (deliberately) a remote figure who \nlacked salience, and the experimenter appeared to share the child\u2019s ignorance. We \nexpected therefore that children would treat the intended meaning of the message as \nunknowable rather than unknown, so that we could examine the variable of interest, \nnamely whether or not there was already an imaginary pet in one of the boxes. When the \nambiguous message indicated that a pet was already in one of the boxes, we expected it \nto be salient that reality was unknown rather than unknowable: Uncertainty would be \nepistemic. In contrast, when the boxes were still empty and the ambiguous message \nindicated that a pet was to occupy one of them in the future, we expected children to be \nmore likely to assume reality was unknowable: Uncertainty would be physical. When \nchildren represented the task as one in which reality was unknown, they could take into \naccount the fact that they (and the story protagonist) had a particular perspective of \nignorance, whereas when they represented the task as one in which reality was \nunknowable, individual perspectives could be ignored.  \nMethod  \nThe experimenter (M. Rowley) described a scenario about Mr. Jones who works \nin a pet shop which contains a number of boxes of different colors and sizes for housing \nand transporting pets. The child\u2019s task was to act on behalf of Mr. Jones, placing food in \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n21\nsealed boxes which could contain animals to be transported to another shop, or putting \nlocks on boxes so the animal could not escape. The child always shared the same state of \nknowledge or ignorance as Mr Jones. \nParticipants.  We included children similar in age to the older age group in \nExperiment 1: 30 children (18 girls) aged 5;9 - 6;9, M age = 6;2. All attended a primary \nschool in Staffordshire, UK, and had English as their first language.  \nProcedure. The experimenter explained the scenario: \"This is Mr. Jones and Mr. \nJones works in a pet shop. There are lots of boxes in the pet shop that the pet shop owner \nuses to send animals to other shops. The owner of the pet shop is always working at \nanother shop a long way away so he leaves messages for Mr. Jones telling him what to \ndo.  Every week Mr. Jones has to send some animals to the other shop. He also has to \nsend plenty of empty boxes so that the other shop always has somewhere to keep their \nanimals.\"  Each child had two experimental trials involving ambiguous messages, one \nwith reality unknown and one with reality unknowable, with order counterbalanced \nbetween children. In addition, each child had two unambiguous control trials on which \nthe message contained sufficient information for her to know the true state of affairs: \nReality was known. One of these unambiguous trials used the materials of the unknown \ntask, and the other used the materials of the unknowable task. The unambiguous control \ntrials immediately preceded their matching ambiguous trial in order to give children any \nbenefit of experiencing the contrast between ambiguous and unambiguous messages.  \nIn the unknown task the child was shown a set of three boxes, for example one \nlarge red box, one large blue box and one small red box. The experimenter demonstrated \nthe placing of locks on the boxes to make sure an animal did not escape, or the placing of \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n22\nfood containers to make sure any animal inside did not go hungry on its journey. The \nexperimenter read out an ambiguous message from the owner, for example \u201cThe mouse is \nin the red box.\u201d The experimenter explained the response options, for example putting \nfood in the red box only, the blue box only, or both boxes. The child was then asked \n\u201cShow me where Mr Jones will put food to make sure the [mouse  \/ hamster] has food to \neat\u201d, and to explain her response. The appropriate response was to put food in both \npossible boxes. After children had responded they were offered an alternative response: \nChildren who had put food in only one box were asked \u201cWhat about putting food in both \nboxes, would that be OK?\u201d Children who spontaneously put food in both boxes were \nasked whether it was OK to put food in only one. Finally children were asked to recall \nwhat the message was on that trial. \nOn the matching control trial using the same materials the message was \nunambiguous, for example \u201cThe hamster is in the blue box\u201d. It was sufficient to put food \nin one box. After the child had responded the experimenter offered the child an \nalternative, referring to both boxes. There was a final recall check as for the ambiguous \nmessage. \n In the unknowable task the experimenter explained that customers could bring \nback unwanted pets. They might bring back a grown-up pet, which could go in any empty \nbox, or a baby pet, which must go in a warm box. The child was shown special boxes for \nbaby birds which contained a perch and a bell, and for baby mice which contained a \nwheel. These boxes for baby pets could be warmed up in advance by turning on a switch. \nAs on the unknown trials, the experimenter read out an ambiguous message from the \nowner, which left it unclear whether a baby mouse or a baby bird was going to come: \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n23\n\u201c\u2026..someone is going to bring back a baby pet\u201d. The child was asked \u201cShow me what \nMr Jones will do to make sure there is a warm box ready\u201d. The appropriate action was to \nput the switches on for both baby pet boxes. As on unknown trials, children were offered \nan alternative response and invited to accept or reject it with a reason, and finally recalled \nthe message. \nOn the matching unambiguous control trial using the same materials, the message \nstated whether a baby mouse or bird was due to be returned, so it was sufficient to put the \nswitch on for one box of the correct type.  \nResults and Discussion  \n Recall of the messages was near ceiling: 2 children made errors on one trial only. \nConcerning selection of food or locks for the boxes, children were scored as passing an \nunambiguous control trial if they acted only on the location referred to in the message \neither spontaneously or after the prompt, and gave an adequate reason which indicated \nthat they knew the content of the message, for example \u201cBecause there\u2019s a mouse in the \nbox\u201d or \u201cThe message said mouse.\u201d As expected, children performed well on the \nunambiguous trials, acting only on the box identified in the message: 7 children out of 30 \nmade one or more errors, in every case by responding to two boxes (e.g. large yellow and \nlarge green) rather than just the one referred to (yellow). This response is not strictly \nwrong given the scenario, since there was no penalty for playing safe and covering \nadditional possibilities. Nevertheless, interpretation of the results depends on the majority \nof children not playing safe when the message was unambiguous, as was the case.  \n Children were scored as passing an ambiguous experimental trial (whether in the \nunknown or the unknowable task) if they acted on both possible locations either \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n24\nspontaneously or after the prompt, and gave an adequate reason (either before or after the \nprompt) which referred to the fact that the animal could be in either location, such as \u201cWe \ndon\u2019t know which one its in.\u201d Hence the scoring in this experiment was similar to the \nlenient scoring in Experiment 1, except that children had the additional demand of giving \nan adequate justification of their response. Table 2 shows the frequency of correct and \nincorrect responses in the unknown and unknowable tasks.  \n- - - - - - \nInsert Table 2 near here \n- - - - - - \nAs shown in Table 2, children performed better in the unknowable task (70% \ncorrect) than in the unknown task (40% correct). Children who passed only one task were \nmore likely to pass the unknowable than the unknown task: binomial test p < .001. Five- \nto 6-year-olds found it easier to acknowledge both possibilities simultaneously when the \nevent was yet to happen compared with when the event had already happened but was \nunknown to the child. \nResults are consistent with those of Experiment 1, and again in line with \nPrediction 2 and against Predictions 1 and 3. Here we extend the finding to children\u2019s \nacting on behalf of a story protagonist, and to conditions under which they were expected \nto give a verbal justification of their response rather than just respond appropriately. \nAlthough children could in principle have considered their own and Mr Jones\u2019 \nperspectives of ignorance vis a vis the intended meaning of the message in both trial \ntypes, they seemed not to do so. Rather, as expected, their own perspective of ignorance \nseemed to be salient only when the imaginary pet was already in one of the boxes.   \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n25\nOne possible weakness of the procedure in Experiment 2 is that the unknown and \nunknowable tasks did not use the same materials, and it could be that for some reason \nchildren just found it more inviting to switch on both switches for a baby pet of unknown \nidentity, than to place food in both boxes for a pet in an unknown location. This seems \nunlikely, particularly given the high frequency of selecting a single switch on \nunambiguous trials using the materials of the unknowable task. Nevertheless as a further \ncheck in Experiment 3 we created a very close match between reality unknown and \nunknowable tasks: Only the tense of the verb in Mr Jones' message differed.  \nIn addition, in Experiment 3 we changed the response measure again to explore \nthe generality of the difference in difficulty between unknown and unknowable \nconditions. In Experiment 1 children acted on their own behalf; in Experiment 2 children \nacted on behalf of a protagonist who shared their own perspective of ignorance; in \nExperiment 3, children gave a mental state judgement for the protagonist (who shared \ntheir perspective of ignorance) by indicating what Mr Jones knew about where the pet \nwas.  \nExperiment 3 \nIn the final experiment, we used the same pet shop scenario as in Experiment 2, \nbut we included trials on which children were asked to make judgements about Mr Jones\u2019 \nknowledge rather than his behaviour. For these trials we used a task similar to the reality \nunknown task of Experiment 2, and created a reality unknowable version. Instead of \nacting on behalf of Mr Jones, children selected a thought bubble to indicate what Mr \nJones knew about where the pet was (on reality unknown trials), or what he knew about \nwhere the pet would be (on reality unknowable trials). In addition, each child had one \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n26\nambiguous reality unknown trial exactly the same as in Experiment 2\u2019s reality unknown \ntask, with a matching unambiguous control message: We now label these action trials to \ndifferentiate them from the thought bubble trials. Given the rather poor performance of \nthe 6-year-olds in the reality unknown task in Experiment 2 (40% correct), in Experiment \n3 we included an older age group, 7- to 8- year-olds. \nThe judgments on action trials (as used in Experiment 2) and the new thought \nbubble trials were importantly different. When the message was ambiguous, children \nwere expected to indicate using a thought bubble that Mr. Jones knew that the pet was \neither in location 1 or in location 2, but that his appropriate action was to place food both \nin location 1 and in location 2. We cannot assume that children would find it equally easy \nor difficult to acknowledge the two possibilities in these two different ways, even though \nthe underlying problem was the same. Should the thought bubble judgments prove to be \nmore difficult, we would not expect this to be due merely to superficial task demands: \nPrevious research (Wellman, Hollander & Schult, 1996) has shown that children very \nmuch younger than the participants in this experiment can handle thought bubble tasks.  \nIn addition, the linguistic concept \u2018either\u2026or\u2019 is one of a group of early acquired \nlinguistic concepts included as sub-test items in The Clinical Evaluation of Language \nFundamentals \u2013 Preschool Test (CELF- Preschool; Wiig, Secord & Semel, 1991). In the \ntest, designed to assess receptive and expressive language ability, 3-year-olds are \nexpected to be able to respond correctly to a direction to select a picture of \u2018either A \u2026or \nB\u2019. We therefore expected that the 5- to 6-year-olds in our sample to have no difficulty \nwith \"either\u2026 or,\" or with selecting thought bubbles to indicate what the protagonist \nknew. \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n27\nParticipants. 40 children (16 girls) aged 5; 9 - 6; 5, M age = 6; 2, and 40 children \n(21 girls) aged 7; 9 - 8; 7, M = 8; 1. Children attended two primary schools in \nStaffordshire, UK, and had English as their first language.  \nProcedure. Each child had four trials: Two action trials (one reality unknown trial \nand one unambiguous control trial using the same materials) which were exactly the same \nas in Experiment 2, and two thought bubble trials. Half the children received a thought \nbubble trial of the reality unknown type, and a matched unambiguous control trial. The \nother half of the children half received a thought bubble trials of the reality unknowable \ntype, and a matched unambiguous control trial. We did not include action unknowable \ntrials in order to maintain a close match between trial types, as will become clearer \nbelow.  \nOn the thought bubble trials with reality unknown and reality unknowable, the \nexperimenter (M. Rowley) read out an ambiguous message from Mr Jones as in \nExperiment 2. For example, \"The rabbit is in the large box\" (unknown) or \"The rabbit is \ngoing to be in the large box\" (unknowable) could refer either to the large pink or the large \nwhite box.  Instead of acting on the boxes, the child was asked to choose one picture from \na set of three pictures with thought bubbles to illustrate what Mr Jones now knew about \nthe pet's location. One picture showed Mr Jones with a thought bubble containing the \nlarge pink box, a second picture showed him with a thought bubble containing the large \nwhite box, and a third picture showed him with a thought bubble containing both the pink \nand the white boxes with the word 'OR' between and a large question mark. The \nexperimenter explained what each picture meant, and asked the child to select one and \ngive a reason. As in Experiment 2, children were then offered an alternative response. For \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n28\nexample a child who had chosen the option depicting \u2018either box\u2019 was asked \"What about \nchoosing the picture that shows he knows the rabbit is in the pink box, would that be \nOK?\" Finally children were asked to recall what the message was on that trial. \nUnambiguous control trials were similar, referring either to a single current location, or to \na single future location.  \nResult and Discussion.  \n As in Experiment 2, recall of the messages was good on all trial types. \nPerformance on unambiguous control trials was also good:  On unambiguous action \ntrials, 2 children made errors and on unambiguous thought bubble trials, no child made an \nerror. \nIn the reality unknown action task we used the same criteria for scoring responses \nas correct or incorrect as in Experiment 2. Equivalent criteria were used for the thought \nbubble reality unknown and unknowable trials: Children passed if they selected the dual \noption thought bubble either spontaneously or after the prompt, and gave a reason which \nreferred to the fact that the pet could be in either location.  \nOn reality unknown action trials, 12 out of 40 5- to 6-year-olds (30%) passed, as \ndid 27 out of 40 (67%) 7- to 8-year-olds. As expected, older children performed \nsignificantly better than younger ones: \u03c72 (79) = 11.26, p = < .001, although performance \nwas not at ceiling even amongst the older children. \nOn the reality unknown thought bubble trials, 3\/20 (15%) 5- to 6-year-olds \npassed, as did 9\/20 (45%) 7- to 8-year-olds. Although the frequencies of correct \nresponses suggest that performance was poorer than on reality unknown action trials, the \ndifference failed to reach significance: Combining across the age groups, 5 children \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n29\npassed the action trials but failed thought bubble, compared with none who showed the \nreverse pattern.  \nOn reality unknowable thought bubble trials 2\/20 (10%) 5- to 6-year-olds \nresponded correctly, as did 16\/20 ( 80%) 7- to 8-year-olds. The older children, but not the \nyounger, performed better on the reality unknowable thought bubble trials than on the \nreality unknown thought bubble trials: \u03c72 (39) = 5.23, p = < .02 (7-8 yrs);  \u03c72 (39) = .23, ns \n(5-6 yrs). \nThe fact that the 5- to 6-year-olds showed no difference in difficulty between the \nreality unknown and unknowable thought bubble trials could be because even the \nunknowable thought bubble judgements were still too difficult for them. Alternatively, \nthey may have had a more superficial difficulty with the thought bubble procedure, \nperhaps finding it hard to understand what the dual possibility thought bubble \nrepresented. We argued above that this latter suggestion was unlikely. For our purposes \nhere, the important result is that for the older children at least, we find differentiation \nbetween reality unknown and unknowable trials, which map onto epistemic and physical \nuncertainty. As in Experiments 1 and 2, results are in line with Prediction 2 and against \nPredictions 1 and 3.  \nFinal Discussion and Conclusions \nThe results of the three experiments reported here provide clear evidence that \nchildren aged between 4 and 8 years differentiate conditions of epistemic uncertainty \nfrom physical uncertainty. Prediction 3, that children this age are insensitive to the \ndistinction, can be rejected. Children, like adults, appear spontaneously to represent their \nown perspective of ignorance even when it is completely irrelevant to the task in hand.  \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n30\nPrediction 1 can also be rejected. Prediction 1 assumed that children who make a \nsingle interpretation are really aware of possibilities, and that making a single \ninterpretation is similar to placing a high bet in the adult tasks, while acknowledging both \npossibilities is similar to placing a low bet in the adult tasks. Adults place higher bets \nunder conditions of physical than epistemic uncertainty. In contrast, our child participants \nwere more likely to make single interpretations under conditions of epistemic than \nphysical uncertainty, contrary to Prediction 1.  \nThe results of all three experiments are in line with Prediction 2.  Prediction 2 \nrested on the assumption that young children have difficulty meeting the representational \ndemands of acknowledging possibilities. Epistemic uncertainty imposes additional \nrepresentational demands: The child represents her own perspective of ignorance. If the \nchild spontaneously decides to do this, she will be less likely to be able also to manage \nthe demands of acknowledging possibilities and will be more likely to make a single \ninterpretation. This account fits the results with three different response measures: The \nchild\u2019s own action (Experiment 1), action on behalf of a story protagonist who shared the \nchild\u2019s perspective of ignorance (Experiment 2), and mental state judgements on behalf \nof a story protagonist (Experiment 3). Discrimination between the two types of \nuncertainty was apparent even for 4-year-olds in Experiment 1. In the thought bubble task \nof Experiment 3 children had to indicate that the outcome could be either X or Y instead \nof marking both X and Y as in Experiments 1 and 2. In Experiment 3, it was only the 7- \nto 8-year-olds who differentiated between types of uncertainty. Not surprisingly, the \nparticular task demands are relevant to whether or not children represent their own \nperspective of ignorance under conditions of epistemic uncertainty.  \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n31\nThe procedures used in the three experiments differed not only in the response \nmeasures, but in the manner in which epistemic uncertainty was conveyed. In Experiment \n1, the game was controlled by the experimenter and on reality unknown trials the \nexperimenter knew which door the block was going to fall through. There was a clear \ndifference in knowledge between child and experimenter. This difference in knowledge \nmight have been sufficient for children to represent their perspective of ignorance, but it \nwas not a necessary feature for them so to do. In Experiments 2 and 3, the child was \ngiven no indication that the experimenter knew the location of the imaginary pet; the \nexperimenter\u2019s role was simply to read out the messages from the pet shop owner. In this \ncase, epistemic rather than physical uncertainty arose because it was salient that the child \ncould easily know which box contained the imaginary pet, rather than because somebody \nelse did know. This could also have been the relevant variable in Experiment 1, since the \nchild could easily have looked behind the doors to see where the block was hidden. \nHence the variable common across all three experiments was the salient presence of a \nhidden object which the child could easily access in principle. From the results so far, \nhowever, we cannot specify the limits of the set of circumstances that prompt children to \nrepresent their own perspective of ignorance.  \nThat they do so at all seems puzzling in the light of the published literature on \nchildren\u2019s failures to take into account their own relative knowledge when it is important \nto do so: The rationale for Prediction 3. As summarized in the introduction, young \nchildren often fail take into account the fact that they know something about which \nanother person is ignorant, and this can contribute to errors in, for example, standard false \nbelief tasks. This phenomenon has been labelled a \u2018realist bias\u2019 (Mitchell, 1996), or a \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n32\n\u2018curse of knowledge\u2019 (Birch & Bloom, 2003).  However, it is important to realise that in \nour tasks we have shown no more than sensitivity to the variable of relative ignorance: \nChildren responded differently under conditions of epistemic and physical uncertainty. In \ncontrast, research on children\u2019s handling of relative knowledge examines their skill at \nresponding correctly, for example when speaking to a listener who knows less than they \ndo, or predicting the action of a protagonist who is relatively ignorant. It is quite possible \nto respond differently under different conditions, showing sensitivity to the variable in \nquestion, despite showing a high level of errors in any one condition.   \nDespite this important proviso, our results perhaps suggest a need to take a \ndifferent slant on children\u2019s \u2018realist bias\u2019 or \u2018curse of knowledge\u2019. First, contrary to Birch \nand Bloom (2003), such errors are not specific to circumstances when the child is the \nmore knowledgeable. Second, realist errors should not be seen as a sign of insensitivity to \ndifferences in perspective. Rather, if our account is correct, children as young as 4 years \nare particularly sensitive to the fact that they have an individual perspective on the world, \neven when this is task-irrelevant. Representing their perspective of ignorance appeared to \ntake precedence over representing the possible outcomes of the task in hand.  \nFinally, our results have potentially important implications for research on \nchildren's developing understanding of the mind as an active interpreter of information. It \nis well documented that although children around the age of 4 years are normally willing \nto acknowledge false beliefs, it is not until they are several years older that they accept \nthat the very same input can be interpreted differently by different people. For example, \nin one task used by Carpendale & Chandler (1996), a coin was hidden under one of three \nblocks, and the child participant heard a message that narrowed the possibilities down to \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n33\ntwo. Two story protagonists each made one of the possible interpretations, and the child \nwas asked to explain why they made different interpretations. Five- to 6-year-olds had \ndifficulty with this, but by 7 to 8 years many children accepted the legitimacy of the \nprotagonists' different interpretations and explained them in terms of ambiguity in the \nmessage. Success in this kind of task is taken to be evidence that the child participant has \ncome to construe the mind as an interpreter of information, and has begun to understand \nthe mark that individual minds can place on incoming information. The evidence \nsuggests that this understanding continues to develop through adolescence and into \nadulthood, with the adoption of increasingly demanding epistemic stances (Kuhn, 2000).  \nThe tasks used in work on interpretive theory of mind involve epistemic rather \nthan physical uncertainty. In the hidden coin task above, the child participant could easily \nhave known where the coin was hidden; she was in a position of relative ignorance. Our \nresults suggest that under such conditions children find it relatively difficult to represent \nthe possibilities for themselves. Poor performance in theory of mind research involving \nsuch tasks might be due not to a failure to understand the mind as an interpreter, but \nrather to difficulty holding in mind both possible interpretations. If children were faced \nwith two protagonists who made different interpretations under conditions of physical, \nrather than epistemic, uncertainty, they might much more readily explain why this was \nlegitimate. What appears in the literature to be an immature conception of the mind may \nreally arise from children's difficulty representing their own position of ignorance under \nconditions of epistemic uncertainty.  \n \nEpistemic and physical uncertainty \n34\nReferences \nAckerman, B.
