Decision makers and other interested citizens now need reliable science-based information to\nhelp them respond to the risks of climate change impacts and opportunities for adaptation (Turnpenny et\nal., 2004). However, these impacts will be in addition to or concurrent with those associated with\ncontinuing socio-economic and political changes (Nakicenovic and Swart, 2000). The impact of climate\nchange therefore needs to be evaluated in a holistic or integrated assessment of the effects of our\nchanging future. Integrated assessment, which is an interdisciplinary process that combines, interprets,\nand communicates knowledge from diverse scientific disciplines from the natural, engineering and social\nsciences to investigate and understand causal relationships within and between complicated systems,\nprovides a tool to develop the information resources required.\nHowever, the scale at which stakeholders require such information for adaptation assessment is rarely the\nglobal or national scale needed for climate policy (Turnpenny et al., 2004), but rather at regional and\nlocal scales (Shackley and Deanwood, 2002). The \u2018Regional Climate Change Impact and Response\nStudies in East Anglia and North West England\u2019 (RegIS) study (Holman et al, 2005 a & b) was one of\nthe first (sub-national) regional Integrated Assessments (IAs) in Europe. RegIS developed and applied a\nmethodology for stakeholder-led, regional climate change impact assessment that explicitly evaluated\nlocal to regional (sub-national) scale impacts and adaptation options, and cross-sectoral interactions\ndriving broad-scale landscape change in agriculture, biodiversity, coastal and floodplain systems and\nwater resources.\nProviding results or interpretations to stakeholders based on the outputs of particular simulations of an IA\nis not sufficient to test the sensitivity of the system, to engender organizational or behavioural change or\nto enable knowledge creation as a learning process. It represents a one-way flow of information, rather\nthan a two-way iterative process of dialogue and exploration of \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d. More interactive IA systems\nare needed that allow stakeholders to develop their understanding and test ideas, based upon their own\nhypotheses.\nUnfortunately of the more than 65 climate change IA models (Hisschem\u00f6ller et al., 2001), most have\nunacceptably long runtimes for allowing rapid simulation and interactive engagement with the IA. It was\nto overcome this obstacle that the two-year RegIS2 study (Holman and de Vries, 2005) was born- its aim\nbeing to investigate and develop the use of computationally simpler modelling techniques, so called\n\u2018metamodels\u2019 or \u2018reduced form models\u2019 (Carmichael et al. 2004), within a user friendly interface (the\n\u2018Regional Impact Simulator\u2019, which is now available from the UK Climate Impacts Programme website\n- www.ukcip.org.uk) to make the RegIS IA methodology available to the wider stakeholder community.\nUnderpinning the development of the Regional Impact Simulator was the need for clear user interfaces,\nexplicit recognition of uncertainty, transparency in model performance and operation, the value and\nimportance of stakeholder \u2018lay insight\u2019 and the need for the interface to provide a mediating focus for the\ndialogue between the research and stakeholder communities within a process of mutual learning and\nguidance (Turnpenny et al., 2004).\nRather than report on each of the sectors within the Regional Impact Simulator individually, which rather\ngoes against the integration concept of RegIS, each paper in this Special Issue has been selected to\nprovide an integrated view of an issue which spans more than one sector.\n\uf0b7 Holman et al. (this issue) begin by describing the concepts for undertaking regional integrated\nclimate change assessment and provide an overview of the development of the \u2018Regional Impact\nSimulator\u2019;\n\uf0b7 Mokrech et al. (this issue) describe the flooding impacts (areas flooded, people affected and\neconomic damages) as a consequence of climate change and socio-economic development;\n\uf0b7 Audsley et al. (this issue) describe the impact of future socio-economic and climate changes on\nregional agricultural land use and the consequences for the wider environment;\n\uf0b7 Henriques et al. (this issue) integrate the effects of socio-economic and climate changes on water\nresources, and describe the implications for water resource availability and agricultural irrigation;\n\uf0b7 Harrison et al. (this issue) integrate water resources and biodiversity to investigate the implications\nfor potential future wetland habitat change;\n\uf0b7 Richards et al. (this issue) describe the implications of climate change on coastal and fluvial\necosystems and the potential for adaptation, including under different socio-economic futures;\n\uf0b7 Holman and Harman (this issue) evaluate the Regional Impact Simulator from the perspective of the\nstakeholder community to assess whether the tool is worthwhile and useful.\nImproving the adaptive capacity of individuals, groups or organizations requires communicating climate\nchange information and building awareness of potential impacts at an appropriate regional level (Adger\net al., 2005). The Regional Impact Simulator is a vehicle for communication, training, forecasting and\nexperimentation (Welp, 2001), whose usefulness is enhanced by the integrated assessment approach\nwhich enables stakeholders to explore \/ understand the interactions between different sectors, rather than\nviewing their own area in isolation. It is therefore hoped that the Regional Impact Simulator will\ncontribute to the UK Government\u2019s objective of a well adapted UK by building the capacity of UK\ndecision-makers to understand the climate and socio-economic impacts and how these might be reduced\nby various adaptation options. Interactive tools such as the Regional Impact Simulator should result in\nregional scale decision-making and policy formulation which takes due account of the impacts of future\nclimate and socio-economic change.\nReferences:\nAdger WN, Arnell NW, Tompkins EL (2005) Successful adaptation to climate change across scales.\nGlobal Environmental Change 15: 77-86\nAudsley E\uf02a, Pearn KR, Harrison PA, Berry PM (This issue)  The impact of future socio-economic and\nclimate changes on agricultural land use and the wider environment in East Anglia and North West\nEngland using a metamodel system.
