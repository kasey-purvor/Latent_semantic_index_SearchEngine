The changes \n                                                 \n* Lecturer in Law, Oxford Brookes University. \n** Professor of Law, Kent Law School. \n \n1\n  We are grateful to the SLSA for funding expenses relating to the interview component of this research and to our \ninterviewees (of whom a list appears below in nn 30-35) for sharing their insights into the reform process with us.  \nWe also thank Emily Jackson, Marie-Andr\u00e9e Jacob, Daniel Monk and two anonymous referees for helpful \ncomments on an earlier version of this paper. \n \n2\n The Act received royal assent on 6 November 2008 and is being phased into operation.  The revised parenthood \nprovisions, contained in Part 2 of the Act, were the first changes to come into force and apply to all treatment \nreceived on or after 6 April 2009.  Other amendments to the 1990 legislation followed in October 2009, with the \nexception of the new parental orders (regarding parenthood resulting from surrogacy) which do not come into force \nuntil April 2010.  See http:\/\/www.hfea.gov.uk\/en\/1752.html. \n \n3\n These are embryos which combine both human and non-human DNA.  The 2008 Act adopted the term \u2018human \nadmixed embryos.\u2019  See s 4A 1990 Act, as amended. \n \n4\n See Sched 2, s 1ZA(1)(d) 1990 Act, as amended.  This process involves screening embryos to select an embryo to \ngrow into a child who would be a genetically compatible tissue donor for an existing sick child.  \n \n5\n See s 13(5) 1990 Act, as amended.  The phrase was replaced with a new requirement that clinicians consider the \nfuture child\u2019s need for \u2018supportive parenting\u2019 in the context of a general welfare assessment. \n \n2 \n \nintroduced to these \u2018status provisions\u2019 are at least equally radical to the deletion of the \u2018need for \na father\u2019 provision (most significantly, in providing for the first time that two women may be \nrecognised as a child\u2019s legal parents from the moment of birth) and are likely to make more \ndifference in practice.  However, reform of the status provisions received significantly less \nattention from respondents in the public consultation exercises and the two Parliamentary \ncommittees which considered the reform, from Parliament itself during debate of the Bill, and \nfrom the media.  Indeed, it would seem that the popular press only became aware of the \nimplications of the new status provisions some months after they had been passed.\n6\n \n \nThe lack of attention provoked by the status provisions might lie in their complexity: one \ncommentator described them as \u201814 pages of legal jargon\u2019.7  Their reform lacks the apparent \nsimplicity and consequent galvanising, polarising appeal of the question of whether \nconsideration of a future child\u2019s \u2018need for a father\u2019 should simply be deleted.   Yet, whilst \ntechnically complex, revising the status provisions raises equally charged questions regarding \nwhat a family should \u2018look like\u2019.  The questions faced by drafters included not merely whether \nlaw should recognise two women as a child\u2019s parents but, if so, on what basis and what \nterminology might best be adopted for two parents of the same sex.  Further, how might we best \nrecognise a child\u2019s social parents (those who will raise him or her) alongside those who \ncontributed genetic material to his or her creation?  Here, the architects of the 2008 Act \nconfronted the possibilities offered not just by the donation of sperm, egg and embryo, but also \nof mitochondrial DNA, offering the possibility of three \u2018parents\u2019 with a genetic link to the child.8  \nIn this paper, our aim is to explain both what is innovative about the provisions which they \ncrafted, but also to elucidate the extent to which, far from offering \u2018a radical and dangerous new \ndeparture in family law\u2019,9 or a \u2018lego-kit model of family life\u2019,10 these provisions equally reflect \ndeep rooted assumptions and highly conservative understandings about who should count as \nfamily.  \n \nIn tracing some of the normative underpinnings of the new law, we adopt the conceptual tool of \nthe \u2018sexual family\u2019 offered by Martha Fineman.  Fineman bemoaned the grip of the \u2018sexual \nfamily\u2019 on the US legal imagination, coining this term as a useful shorthand to describe the ideal \nfamily type of a heterosexual couple, joined through a formally celebrated union, living with \n                                                 \n6\n For example, the Daily Mail reported the parenthood provisions as \u2018news\u2019 in March 2009:  F. MacRae, \u2018Another \nblow to fatherhood: IVF mothers can name ANYONE as \u2018father\u2019 on birth certificate \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t even have to be \na man\u2019 Daily Mail (2 March 2009).

Smith, \u2018Single Women Can Name \u201calmost anyone\u201d as Second Parent after IVF\u2019 Daily Telegraph (2 March \n2009). \n \n8\n The legislature needed also to consider the future possible reproductive use of artificial gametes (derived from \nadult stem cells).  This was prohibited under the 2008 Act, which amended s 3 of the 1990 Act to provide that only \n\u2018permitted\u2019 embryos and gametes can be put to reproductive use.  Artificial gametes do not fall within the relevant \ndefinition provided in s 3ZA of the 1990 Act, as amended. \n \n9\n Per Christian Institute, House of Lords, House of Commons Joint Committee on the Human Tissue and Embryos \n(Draft) Bill, Vol II Evidence, Session 2006-07, HL Paper 169-II, HC Paper 630-II (July 2007), Ev 61, para 13. \n \n10\n Per Family Education Trust, ibid, Ev 69, question 16(a). \n \n3 \n \ngenetically related offspring.\n11\n  According to Fineman, such an understanding of the family has \nbeen at the centre of the development of family law and policy, being assumed both as the reality \nfor which legislation should be made and the ideal norm, which it should strive to enforce.  This, \nshe argues, has resulted in legislation that is more concerned with family form than the actual \ncontingencies of care-taking relationships and dependency.  In this paper, we take the concept of \nthe \u2018sexual family\u2019 as a useful framework for seeking to understand the changes introduced by \nthe 2008 Act.  We describe what, in these reforms might seem disruptive of the unity of the \nsexual family, yet we aim also to trace the tenacious hold of this model on English law in the \nface of developments which might appear at first sight to herald its decline.  As such, we also \naim to track how the legal sexual family concept is adapting and, perhaps, buckling in the light \nof this changing context.  First, however, we provide a little background regarding the process by \nwhich the 1990 Act came to be amended. \n \nTHE REFORM PROCESS \nThe 1990 Act established a regulatory regime, overseen by the Human Fertilisation and \nEmbryology Authority (\u2018the HFEA\u2019), for embryo research and for those infertility treatment \nservices which involve the creation of embryos outside a woman\u2019s body or the use of any gametes \nother than her own and those of her partner, as well as the storage (and post-storage use of) \ngametes.\n12\n  The 1990 Act had its origins in a report produced by a Committee of Inquiry, chaired by \nMary (now Baroness) Warnock in 1984.\n13\n  Some twenty years on, the Government felt that it was \ntime to reconsider the operation of the legislation:  \nThe [1990] Act has stood the test of time well, and is a tribute to the foresight of its creators ... The Act and the \nregulatory system it established have instilled public confidence in the safe and ethical use of assisted \nreproduction technology subject to appropriate safeguards.  However, it was never expected that the Act would \nremain forever unchanged in this area of fast-moving science.\n14\n  \nReform was thus thought necessary to update the legislation in the light of advancing scientific \nknowledge and to attempt to \u2018future proof\u2019 it against developments yet to come.15  It would also \nprovide an opportunity to consolidate various changes made to the legislation since its inception and \nto address certain further lacunae or problems which had become evident with the existing wording \nof the 1990 Act.\n16\n   Significantly for our purposes, the 2008 Act would also provide an opportunity \nto update the legislation in the light of changing social and familial norms, most notably with \n                                                 \n11\n M.

See above n 8. \n \n16\n Most notably, for our purposes, the ambiguity of the phrase \u2018treatment together\u2019 in establishing legal fatherhood \nunder s 28(3) 1990 Act.  See further below. \n  \n4 \n \nrespect to the recognition of same sex parents, who were felt by many to be discriminated against by \nthe operation of the 1990 Act.   \nThe first major step in concretising ideas for reform was undertaken in the House of Commons \nScience and Technology Committee\u2019s Report on Human Reproductive Technologies and the \nLaw in 2005,\n17\n which drew on the responses to an on-line public consultation exercise and \nevidence provided by a range of expert witnesses.\n18\n  While this Committee undertook a wide-\nranging review of the operation of the 1990 Act, it declined to consider the working of the status \nprovisions.\n19\n  This Report was followed by the Department of Health\u2019s own review of the \nlegislation in the same year,\n20\n which drew on a further public consultation, followed by a white \npaper setting out proposals for reform.\n21\n   The Department of Health then published draft \nlegislation,\n22\n which was scrutinised by a Joint Committee of the House of Commons and House \nof Lords, chaired by the Liberal Democrat MP, Phil Willis.\n23\n  The Joint Committee conducted its \nown on-line consultation exercise on a number of specific questions (none of which concerned \nparenthood),\n24\n as well as inviting both written and oral evidence on a broader range of issues.\n25\n  \nThe Joint Committee\u2019s work did include brief consideration of the status provisions but it made \nno recommendations regarding them.\n26\n  Revised legislation, incorporating many of the Joint \n                                                 \n17\n House of Commons Science & Technology Committee, Human Reproductive Technologies and the Law (Fifth \nReport of Session 2004-5.

Following the dropping of provisions foreseeing the merging of \nthe HFEA and Human Tissue Authority, the title of the Bill was changed to the Human Fertilisation and \nEmbryology Bill.  For reasons of clarity, we refer to the Bill by this name throughout. \n \n23\n House of Lords, House of Commons Joint Committee on the Human Tissue and Embryos (Draft) Bill, Vol 1: \nReport, Session 2006-07, HL Paper 169-I, HC Paper 630-I (July 2007) (hereafter \u2018JC Vol 1\u2019) and Vol II: Evidence, \nSession 2006-07, HL Paper 169-II, HC Paper 630-II (July 2007) (hereafter \u2018JC Vol 2\u2019); see also HM Government, \nGovernment Response to the Report from the Joint Committee on the Human Tissue and Embryos (Draft) Bill, \nReport Cm 7209 (2007). \n \n24\n For details, see JC Vol 1, pp 105-10.   \n \n25\n  See JC Vol 2. \n \n26\n Though it did recommend that further consideration be given to whether the fact of donation be registered on a \nbirth certificate (JC Vol 1, para 276) and further changes be made to the draft welfare clause (para 243). \n \n5 \n \nCommittee\u2019s recommendations, was then subject to over eighty hours of parliamentary debate.27  \nWhile the revision of the welfare clause did occupy a significant proportion of this time, again, \nthe status provisions passed virtually undiscussed.\n28\n \nIn this paper, we draw on the extensive published documentation produced at all stages of the \nprocess described above.  While we are interested in the content of these discussions, our focus \non the status provisions means that we are inevitably also interested in what was ignored or not \nconsidered in any detail within them, being deemed a low priority or simply taken for granted as \nentirely uncontroversial.  In order better to address these questions, we rely on a further key \nsource: a small number of semi-structured, in-depth interviews with key actors who were \ninvolved in shaping the legislation.\n29\n  Our interviewees included key officials at the Department \nof Health with responsibility for overseeing the drafting and implementation of the relevant \naspects of the legislation,\n30\n a senior member of the HFEA,\n31\n the academic legal advisors to the \ntwo parliamentary committees mentioned above,\n32\n the Chair of the Joint Committee,\n33\n and a \nfurther member of that Committee, who is also a member of the House of Lords and herself a \nformer Chair of the HFEA.\n34\n  We also draw on a number of communications with the General \n                                                 \n27\n For the text of the Bill, amendments tabled and links to all parliamentary debates, see:  \nhttp:\/\/services.parliament.uk\/bills\/2007-08\/humanfertilisationandembryology.html. \n \n28\n Totalling up the occasional brief mentions to the status provisions over the course of this eighty hours gives a total \nof around one hour, with about fifteen minutes of this occupied with discussion of the clause that was to become s \n46 of the 2008 Act, dealing with the naming on a birth certificate of a partner who dies prior to the treatment of the \nmother: see HL Debs vol 698 cols 475-9 (28 January 2008).  This does not take account of discussion relating to a \nchild\u2019s right to information regarding his\/her conception and whether birth certificates should be marked in some \nway to indicate donor conception, which was far more thoroughly discussed.  \n \n29\n Key actors were identified by the authors by virtue of the professional role which they had held in the reform \nprocess, with each interviewee also asked to identify anyone who they felt had played a particularly significant role \nin the reform process.  Interviewees were contacted directly by the authors and all requests for interviews were \ngranted with two exceptions: Dawn Primarolo, MP (the Minister responsible for steering the 2008 Act through \nParliament) and Kenneth Clark, MP (the Minister responsible for steering the 1990 Act through Parliament).  \nInterviewees were sent a brief synopsis of the research project in the initial invitation.  Interviewees were also \noffered an indicative list of questions for preparatory purposes, with three interviewees requesting this information \n(McLean, Morgan and Willis, see below nn 32 and 33).  The interviews, ranging from 40-120 minutes, were \nconducted by the authors and transcribed by a professional transcriber.  A copy of the interview schedule is on file \nwith the authors. \n \n30\n Edward Webb, Deputy Director for Human Tissue Transplantation, Embryology and Consent; Gwen Skinner, the \npolicy manager responsible for the development of the legal parenthood provisions in the 2008 Act; and Katy Berry, \nwho was responsible for the implementation of the 2008 Act. \n \n31\n  Emily Jackson, Deputy Chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. \n \n32 \n Derek Morgan, Advisor to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee and Sheila McLean, \nAdvisor to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee and the Joint Committee. \n \n33\n Phil Willis, MP. \n \n34\n Baroness Ruth Deech. \n \n6 \n \nRegister Office.\n35\n  While the limitations of the information which can be gleaned from such \ninterviews should be acknowledged, our interviewees provided numerous insights into the \nreform process that are unavailable from the published documentation.\n36\n \nThe reform process outlined above was lengthy and undoubtedly resulted in rigorous scrutiny of \ncertain key aspects of the 2008 Act.  However, there were also some important limitations on \nwhat was achievable in this process, which should be noted at the outset.  First and most \nsignificantly, the 2008 Act is an amending statute.  Nowhere was a blank piece of paper offered \nfor reform, in a way that allowed for a thorough and fundamental rethinking of the kind of \nregulation which might best suit this area or the ethical principles which should underpin it.  \nRather the architects of reform worked outwards from the provisions already in place, making \nthe key question not \u2018what model of law do we want?\u2019 but rather \u2018what needs to be changed?\u2019 \nIndeed, the Joint Committee described the reform process as \u2018tinkering with the existing legal \nprovisions rather than going back to first principles and seeking to take an overall view of where \nto go in the next fifteen years\u2019, singling out the approach taken to parenthood as one of two \nspecific examples of the inadequacies of approach.\n37\n  While Phil Willis MP, the Chair of that \nCommittee, confirmed his frustration with this method in interview, the fact that only new \nclauses would be subject to parliamentary debate undoubtedly eased the successful passage of \nthe Act, making the Government\u2019s work far easier.38  For current purposes, it can be noted that \nwhile some aspects of the status provisions were completely rewritten, those regulating legal \nmotherhood and the attribution of fatherhood to the legal mother\u2019s husband were left almost \nuntouched and barely considered.  \nSecond, as we noted above, the time available for scrutiny of the legislation was heavily \ndominated by a relatively narrow range of issues.  These issues were dictated by a combination \nof factors, including: key individuals\u2019 power to influence the agenda of the parliamentary \n                                                 \n35 \n Email correspondence with David Trembath, Births, Deaths and Adoptions Branch at the General Register Office. \n \n36\n In so far as is possible within such a small cohort of interviewees, we attempted to mitigate problems of fading \nmemories and selective recall by interviewing more than one person involved in each key stage of the reform \nprocess (which we take to be the drafting of the legislation overseen by the Department of Health, the pre-legislative \nscrutiny offered by the Joint Committee and discussion of the new statute in Parliament) and by checking the \ninformation gleaned from the interviews against the available published documentation.  While key actor interviews \nhave some well-rehearsed limitations, we have nevertheless obtained a perspective on this reform process that would \nsimply not have been possible to glean from the published documentation alone.  For a methodological \nconsideration of key actor interviews, see T. Odendahl and A. Shaw, \u2018Interviewing Elites\u2019 in J Gubrium and J. \nHolstein (eds), Handbook of Interview Research: Context and Method (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 2002) 299-316. \n \n37\n Along with the approach to the regulation of human admixed embryos.  JC Vol 1, para 44.  \n \n38\n Respectively, interviews with Willis and Webb on file.  Webb told us: \u2018an option could have been just to repeal \nthe 1990 Act altogether and start with a new one that starts at clause one. But that would have required a debate on \nall the various provisions and sections in the 1990 Act, including those where there were no Government proposals \nfor change and if everyone is happy, then why volunteer provisions to be reopened?  So that was a conscious \ndecision by Ministers to have an Amendment Act.'  And later: \u2018We have to be aware there's a job to do, in a certain \ntime-scale and we can\u2019t afford to turn over stones that we don\u2019t need to turn over.\u2019  \n \n7 \n \ncommittees;\n39\n significant media interest in particular aspects of the law; attention from the public \nand expert witnesses in the various consultation exercises;\n40\n and the limited amount of available \ntime, which resulted in matters deemed less pressing simply falling off the agenda.  The Joint \nCommittee Chair told us that he had hoped that many of the issues which had been insufficiently \ndiscussed in Committee would have received further attention in Parliament but this did not \nhappen because of way that debate had been guillotined around the \u2018big sexy issues\u2019.41  In terms \nof parenthood under the Act, each of these factors appears heavily to have contributed to the \nfocus on the \u2018need for a father\u2019 provision and lack of detailed scrutiny of the status provisions, \nnoted above. Further, it should be noted that a significant proportion of the time available to the \nJoint Committee for the essential work of detailed pre-legislative scrutiny was taken up with \nexploring (and eventually defeating) the Government\u2019s plan to merge the HFEA with the Human \nTissue Authority to form a new regulatory body: the Regulatory Authority for Tissues and \nEmbryos (\u2018RATE\u2019).  This proposal emerged as a cost-cutting measure following the Department \nof Health\u2019s review of Arm\u2019s Length Bodies.42  The proposal found favour with virtually no one \nbut absorbed an extensive amount of time and energy \u2013 not to mention the general resources that \nwere expended in the preparations for RATE \u2013 from a Committee which was already forced to \nwork to a seriously constrained timeframe, thus exacerbating the need to prioritise which aspects \nof reform might be considered.\n43\n    \nA third point to note is that the task of overseeing the redrawing of the legislation fell to a \nGovernment Department \u2013 Health \u2013 that does not have central responsibility for law and policy \nrelating to the family.  As we will explain below, some radical innovations in family law in other \ncountries (most notably the recognition of three legal parents on the birth certificate) are taking \nplace in the context of conceptions resulting from the use of assisted reproduction.  In this reform \nprocess, however, the view was strongly taken that it was not for a Government Department \nconcerned with health to instigate significant change in the area of family law and policy.\n44\n   \nRather, the Department of Health took a deliberately cautious view, eschewing any radical \ninnovation in this area, emphasising the importance of legislating for the majority of cases and \n                                                 \n39\n In this sense, Sheila McLean, who was the specialist advisor to both parliamentary committees, told us: \u2018I got no \nsense that there was any real interest in the parenthood thing at all, to be honest.\u2019  Derek Morgan, advisor to the \nScience and Technology Committee explained it in terms of that Committee being interested in the \u2018politics of \nreproductive regulation and not the politics of reproduction.\u2019 Interviews on file. \n \n40\n Willis, interview on file.   \n \n41\n Willis, interview on file. \n \n42\n See further Department of Health, Reconfiguring the Department of Health\u2019s Arm\u2019s Length Bodies (2004). \n \n43\n The Joint Committee was given just under nine sitting weeks to consider the draft legislation, rather than the \nrecommended 12.  JC Vol 1, paras 2-3.  It is ironic that a measure designed to save time and money could have \nabsorbed such extensive resources. \n \n44\n  Webb, interview on file. \n \n8 \n \nensuring that provisions were drafted in such a way as to accord with common sense views of the \nfamily.\n45\n \nWhile the 2008 Act introduces a number of changes relevant to parenthood, as noted above our \nfocus here is on just the reworking of the \u2018status provisions\u2019.46  In what follows, we consider in \nturn the provisions regulating the acquisition of motherhood, fatherhood and female parenthood.  \nWith regard to each, we briefly outline the working of the 1990 Act before going on to provide a \ndetailed exposition of the provisions which were eventually voted onto the statute books. We then \nmove on to a close analysis of the enduring legacy of the \u2018sexual family\u2019 model in this reform \nprocess.  Relying on this conceptual framework, we aim to make explicit some of the broad beliefs \nand values which implicitly underpinned the choices made in this process, thus opening them up for \nfurther ethically and empirically informed evaluation in the future. \n \n \nTHE \u2018STATUS PROVISIONS\u2019 OF THE 2008 ACT \n \nThe \u2018status provisions\u2019 of the 1990 and 2008 Acts set out who should be treated as the legal \nparents of a child conceived through regulated treatments in those, relatively rare, cases where \nthe child is not straightforwardly the genetic offspring of both parents.\n47\n   As we aim to show, the \nmodel of family underlying these provisions was barely considered by the reformers at all, not \nforming a core part of the reform project.  Rather, those involved in the reform project tended to \nrely on common sense assumptions about the family, which were subject to little sustained \nscrutiny or critical evaluation.  \n \n                                                 \n45\n Skinner described how Department of Health officials worked by testing out the new agreed parenthood \nprovisions against their intuitions: \u2018We went through a lot of situations where we imagined possible circumstances \nthat could arise and tested out the Bill to see if it would meet those.  For example,  thinking through the most \ncomplex personal relationship changes, which could possibly happen  in a period of six months,  to see if the Bill \nworked ... We thought about all the things that could happen to a couple, maybe other people coming into the \nrelationship or a person making a different decision about her sexual orientation and marrying someone when she\u2019s \ngot a legal parenthood agreement in place with another woman and seeing if the Bill worked against all possible \nscenarios.  That was the test really.\u2019 Interview on file. \n \n46\n A number of further changes of interest are not discussed here.  Notably, the new law also includes an extension \nof the rights of children conceived via gamete donation to information regarding the circumstances of their \nconception; a relaxing of the eligibility requirements for \u2018fast-track\u2019 adoption procedures following surrogacy \narrangements;  a prohibition on the reproductive use of artificial gametes (derived from adult stem cells); the \nintroduction of a \u2018cooling off\u2019 period before embryos can be destroyed in the light of a disagreement as to their \nfuture disposition on the part of the man and woman who contributed the gametes resulting in their creation; and, as \nnoted above, it replaces the requirement that clinicians consider a future child\u2019s need for a father with a requirement \nto consider the child\u2019s need for \u2018supportive parenting\u2019 in s 13(5).  On the first of these, see further C. Jones, \u2018The \nIdentification of \u201cParents\u201d and \u201cSiblings\u201d: New Possibilities Under the Reformed Human Fertilisation and \nEmbryology Act\u2019 in J. Wallbank, S. Choudhry and J. Herring (eds), Rights, Gender and Family Law (London: \nRoutledge Cavendish, in press 2009) ch 10. \n \n47\n In the vast majority of treatment services provided in clinics, the future parents\u2019 own gametes will be used.  The \nlegislation covers only treatments involving donated gametes (sperm, ova, embryos) and\/or the creation of an \nembryo outside of a woman\u2019s body, see n 12 above.  Some licensed treatments are not caught by the status \nprovisions, namely insemination procedures whereby the sperm of the woman\u2019s husband or partner is used.   \n \n9 \n \nIn very broad terms, the 2008 Act maintains the 1990 Act\u2019s provisions regarding motherhood, \nrewrites the provisions regarding fatherhood whilst remaining true to their ethos, and introduces \none particularly significant innovation: if certain conditions are met, the female partner \u2013 or, \nindeed, friend or acquaintance \u2013 of a mother who conceives through the regulated technologies \nmay also now be recognised as the resulting child\u2019s legal parent.  As noted above, the new \nparenthood provisions were the first part of the 2008 Act to come into operation, applying to all \nregulated treatments which take place on or after 6 April 2009.  Here, we first outline the \nchanges introduced to legal motherhood and legal fatherhood resulting from the use of regulated \ntechnologies before going on to look at the female parenthood provisions.   \n \nMotherhood \n \nThe attribution of the status of mother proved relatively straightforward in both the 1990 and \n2008 Acts: excluding the case of adoption, the birth mother and no other is to be treated as the \nlegal mother of the child.\n48\n  This remains true whether or not the egg used to conceive the \npregnancy was the woman\u2019s own and regardless of whether a surrogacy agreement was in \nexistence.  This gestational grounding of motherhood has meant that, in the UK, a surrogate \nmother\u2019s right to be recognised as a child\u2019s legal mother has never been successfully \nchallenged.\n49\n  It should be noted that not all jurisdictions have followed this approach: most \nfamously, the Californian court in Johnson v Calvert took the view that motherhood might be \ngrounded in genetic links combined with an intention to create a child.\n50\n  Yet in the UK reform \nprocess, at no point was any serious consideration given to the possibility of changing the \nprinciple that motherhood is singularly grounded in gestation.\n51\n   \n  \nHowever, the 2008 Act does contain one innovation pertaining to motherhood: it gives added \nemphasis to the principle that no route to legal motherhood (or female parenthood),\n52\n can be \nachieved purely on the basis of a genetic link, providing that a woman is not to be treated as the \nparent of a child who she has not carried, except where she is so treated on the basis of other \nprovisions of the Act.\n53\n  The section mirrors a similar provision which, in certain circumstances, \nexempts a man from being considered the legal father of a child resulting from his donated \n                                                 \n48\n s 27 1990 Act, s 33 2008 Act. \n \n49\n In Re P (a Child) [2007] EWCA Civ 105, on a highly unusual set of facts, the genetic father succeeded in winning \na residence order but the surrogate\u2019s legal status as the child\u2019s mother remained undisturbed.  For the genetic \nfather\u2019s wife to be considered as the child\u2019s legal mother, she will have to adopt the child. \n \n50\n  [1993] 5 Cal.4th 84.  The court ruled that when two women can prove they have biological links with a child \n(through ova\/gestation), the one who intended to bring about the birth of a child that she intended to raise as her own \nis the legal mother.  It was considered that this principle would similarly apply to egg donation cases. \n \n51\n There is no discussion of other possibilities in the published documentation listed above, see nn 17-23, and our \ninterviews confirmed a lack of such discussion \u2018behind the scenes\u2019.   \n \n52\n For the acquisition of \u2018female parenthood\u2019, see below. \n \n53\n s 47. Notably: civil partnership, agreement with the mother, where provisions regarding the transfer of embryos \nafter the death of civil partner\/agreed female parent apply, or adoption.  \n \n10 \n \nsperm.\n54\n  Yet with regard to men, such a provision is clearly legally necessary: unlike \nmotherhood, fatherhood can be \u2013 and indeed very frequently is \u2013 acquired on the basis of a \ngenetic connection.  With regard to women, the section might appear to be legally redundant \ngiven the very clear provisions setting out that legal motherhood is to be established only \nthrough gestation (and \u2018female parenthood\u2019 only through the provisions detailed below).   As \nsuch, the decision to include it is of interest, and we discuss it further below. \n \nFatherhood \n \nUnder the 1990 Act, where a child was conceived through the use of donor sperm following \neither licensed treatment or \u2018artificial insemination\u2019, the woman\u2019s husband would be the legal \nfather unless it could be shown that he did not consent to the relevant treatment.\n55\n   Despite a \ncommon assumption to the contrary, the framing of this provision in terms of \u2018artificial \ninsemination\u2019 served also to catch self-arranged donor insemination, provided that the \nconception was not through sexual intercourse.  Marriage thus commanded a privileged place as \nthe preferred way of attributing legal fatherhood.  \n \nIf no father existed by virtue of marriage, an unmarried man could be deemed the legal father \nwhere receiving licensed \u2018treatment together\u2019 with the mother.56  Unmarried male partners were \nthus able to gain the same parental status as married men, though only where conception resulted \nfrom licensed treatment services and without the presumption of consent that occurred in \nmarriage.\n57\n  Where someone was treated as a father by virtue of either of these provisions, no \nother man was to be treated as the father of the child.\n58\n  As mentioned above, where sperm had \nbeen obtained through a licensed clinic, a sperm donor was not to be treated as the legal father.  \nThe effect of this, where treatment services were provided for a single woman or a woman in a \nsame sex relationship, was that the resulting child would be legally fatherless.  As such, the 1990 \nAct extended the severing of a legal connection between genetic paternity and legal fatherhood, \nfirst to licensed treatments other than donor insemination and, second, to unmarried male \npartners.\n59\n  It also evidenced a clear intention that a child could and should have only one legal \nfather: a married woman who sought treatment services together with a different male partner \ncould not succeed in securing two legal fathers for her children. \n \nThese provisions have been understood as an attempt to foresee the various ways in which \npeople might seek to make use of reproductive technologies and to impose a \u2018sexual family\u2019 \n                                                 \n54\n s 28(6) 1990 Act; s 41 2008 Act. \n \n55\n s 28(2). In the absence of consent, there is nonetheless a rebuttable presumption that the husband is the father, see \ns 28(5) which explicitly saves the common law marital presumption of paternity.   \n \n56\n s 28(3).  \n \n57\n Note, however, that the 1990 Act conferred only parental status and not parental responsibility, which is conferred \nthrough provisions in the Children Act 1989.  \n \n58 \ns 28(4). \n \n59\n Thus extending the measures introduced by s 27 Family Law Reform Act 1987. \n \n11 \n \ntemplate upon the resulting familial relationships.\n60\n  Yet such foresight inevitably had its limits \nand one important task facing the architects of the 2008 Act was to remove the ambiguity in the \nprovision regulating the acquisition of fatherhood by unmarried men, which had been \nhighlighted through legal challenges in the years since 1990.\n61\n Rejecting the test of \u2018treatment \ntogether\u2019 and the similarly ambiguous notion of \u2018joint enterprise\u2019 which the courts had developed \nto give it meaning,\n62\n the 2008 Act nevertheless remains true to the spirit of the 1990 legislation.  \nIt maintains the position that, where a woman seeks treatment with her husband, he will be the \nlegal father unless it can be shown that he did not consent to the treatment.\n63\n  For unmarried \nfathers, it accepts the principle that legal fatherhood should be grounded in the parents\u2019 intention, \nyet rewrites the test to be used to achieve this result, adopting a highly formalised, contractual \nmodel, which it is hoped, will offer rather more clarity.\n64\n  Thus, the 2008 Act provides that if \nthere is neither a father by virtue of marriage nor a female parent by virtue of civil partnership, \nthen an unmarried man can be treated as a child\u2019s father, provided that \u2018agreed fatherhood \nconditions\u2019 are met.65  These conditions provide that both the intended mother and father must \nhave given written and signed consent to the man being treated as the father of any child \nresulting from the licensed treatment; that at the time of implantation or insemination neither \nparty has given notice of withdrawal of this consent; and that the woman has not given further \nnotice that she consents to someone else being treated as the father (or female parent) of the \nchild.\n66\n  Significantly, these provisions do not restrict the acquisition of parenthood to a woman\u2019s \npartner, rather they turn on consent (both the mother\u2019s and father\u2019s) in grounding fatherhood.67 \n                                                 \n60\n J. Dewar, \u2018The Normal Chaos of Family Law\u2019 (1998) 61 MLR 467, 482; S. Sheldon \u2018Fragmenting Fatherhood: \nthe Regulation of Reproductive Technologies\u2019 (2005) 68 MLR 523.  As we noted above, the Department of Health \ndescribed how they would invent various scenarios in which individuals might seek to have children, determine who \nwould be considered the legal parents under the (then draft) legislation and test these outcomes against their own \nintuitions as to what was right, n 45 above. \n \n61 \nRe B (Parentage) [1996] 2 FLR 15, U v W [1997] 2 FLR 282, Re R (Contact: HFEA) (2001) 1 FLR 247, The \nLeeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust v Mr A, Mrs A and Others [2003] EWCA 259 (QBD).  These cases are \nexamined in more detail in Sheldon, ibid. \n \n62\n ibid. \n \n63\n s 35.   \n \n64\n Webb, interview on file.  Unsurprisingly, this very contractual form of words results from the Department of \nHealth\u2019s team of lawyers, who delivered this wording as a means of achieving the outcome desired by the \nDepartment.   \n \n65 \nss 36-37. \n \n66\n Where consent is withdrawn by someone who had previously agreed to be treated as a parent of a child born to a \nwoman as a result of treatment services provided to her under the Act, the clinic has a duty to tell the woman of this \nchange in circumstances and cannot treat her until she has been so notified: see s 14(6D) of the 1990 Act, as \namended.  However, where the future mother consents to A being treated as the parent of a child resulting from \ntreatment services provided to her (thus extinguishing the claims to parental status of B, who had previously \nconsented to be treated as the future child\u2019s father or female parent), the clinic\u2019s duty is merely to take \u2018reasonable \nsteps\u2019 to notify A of the change in circumstances: s 14(6E), 1990 Act, as amended.    \n  \n67\n Nonetheless, the most recent edition of the HFEA Code of Practice has retained the language of \u2018partner\u2019 to \ndescribe the prospective second parent.   This raises the questions of the extent to which the impact of the new \n12 \n \nThe provisions do contain one important limitation: the intended parents must not fall within the \nprohibited degrees of relationship foreseen in incest legislation.\n68\n  We return to this below.   \n \nFinally, the 2008 Act incorporates into the 1990 Act the provisions of the Human Fertilisation \nand Embryology (Deceased Fathers) Act 2003 which allow for a man to be registered \nposthumously as the father of a child.\n69\n  This status is limited to being named on the birth \nregister as the child\u2019s father, and is applicable whether or not the man\u2019s own sperm or donor \nsperm is used in the treatment.\n70\n  The man must have given written consent for this to happen \nand the mother must consent to his name being recorded on the birth certificate.\n71\n \n \nFemale Parenthood \n \nThe most radical change introduced in the reworking of the status provisions is to allow for the \nfirst time for same sex female partners each to be recognised as the legal parent of a child from \nthe moment of birth.\n72\n  The birth mother would, as previously, be recognised as the legal mother \nby virtue of having gestated the pregnancy.\n73\n  Under the 2008 Act her partner, or any other \nwoman to whom she is not prohibitively related, can also be recognised as a \u2018female parent\u2019 on \nlines directly analogous to those by which men may be recognised as fathers.  Thus, where a \nwoman is in a registered civil partnership, her partner will be recognised as the child\u2019s \u2018female \nparent\u2019 unless it can be shown that she did not consent to the treatment or artificial \ninsemination.\n74\n  Very significantly, as for heterosexual married couples, this provision does not \napply merely to treatment received in a licensed clinic.  As such, where a civil partnered lesbian \ncouple have a child through self-arranged donor insemination, both partners are now legally \nentitled to be registered as parents on a child\u2019s birth certificate and the genetic father will not be \nrecognised.  Where a woman is not in a civil partnership, her partner, or another woman, can \nnonetheless be recognised as a \u2018female parent\u2019 if treatment is received at a licensed clinic and if \n                                                                                                                                                             \nparenthood provisions has been well understood and, further, whether the HFEA\u2019s choice of terminology may prove \nmisleading for clinicians.  See HFEA Code of Practice (8\nth\n Edition), e.g. at paras 8.3, 8.13.  \n \n68\n Marriage Act 1949, First Schedule, as amended by the Marriage Act 1949 (Remedial) Order 2007 (abolishing the \nbar to marriages between former parents and children-in-law).   \n \n69\n s 28(5A), 1990 Act, as amended. \n \n70\n ss 39-40 2008 Act, respectively.  Note the separate provisions here for posthumous genetic fatherhood and \nposthumous non-genetic fatherhood. \n \n71\n Such recognition of paternity has no legal force, for example, in terms of nationality or succession.  Rather, this \nmeasure suggests the symbolic importance of fatherhood in completing the nuclear family. See further Sheldon, n 60 \nabove. \n \n72 \nSame-sex couples have been able to achieve joint parenthood by virtue of adoption since the Adoption and \nChildren Act 2002, which came into force in December 2005. \n \n73\n s 33, see above. \n \n74\n s 42. \n \n13 \n \nthe \u2018agreed female parenthood conditions\u2019, which exactly mirror the agreed fatherhood \nconditions, as set out above, are met.\n75\n \n \nThe provisions regarding posthumous registration of fatherhood are likewise extended to female \nparenthood.  While, in the case of men, the legislation contains two separate provisions (one \nregulating cases where the man\u2019s own sperm was to be used, another where it was not), for \nfemale parenthood only one provision is deemed necessary.\n76\n  This serves to emphasise the legal \nirrelevance of whether or not a woman is a genetic parent, a point to which we return shortly.  \n \n \nTHE 2008 ACT AND THE \u2018SEXUAL FAMILY\u2019 \n \nAs has been noted by earlier commentators, reproductive technologies offer the possibility to \nbreak down parenthood into the various constituent parts (including social, intentional, genetic \nand gestational links) on which parenthood has typically been predicated and which, in the \nsexual family model, are all located within the sexual couple composed of one mother and one \nfather, who raise their own genetic children.\n77\n  Separating out these different facets of \nparenthood offers difficult challenges for a legal order which has historically laboured hard to \nmaintain the fiction that they are united in the sexual family.  Law has policed this fiction in \nvarious ways, most notably through simply refusing to recognise non-marital children who were \ntreated as filius nullius and thus excluded from a place within this symbolic legal order; and \nthrough rules making it virtually impossible for a married couple to establish that children born \nduring a marital union had actually been fathered by a man other than the husband.\n78\n \n \nHowever, the coherence of the legal \u2018sexual family\u2019 ideal is increasingly out of touch with \ndemographic reality.  If such assumptions were ever possible, it is clear that today it cannot be \npresumed that children will be raised by a couple\n79\n or, where they are, that the couple will be \nheterosexual\n80\n or joined in a formally celebrated union.\n81\n Further, many children will not be \n                                                 \n75\n ss 43-44. \n \n76\n s 46. \n \n77\n Diduck quite rightly notes that there is nothing natural or inevitable about law\u2019s reliance on these particular \nfactors.

The regulatory framework imposed in the 1990 Act strove \nto maintain and entrench the \u2018sexual family\u2019 model at a time when other aspects of family law \nhad already developed far more flexible and creative ways of recognising the significance which \nmultiple \u2018parent\u2019 figures might have in a child\u2019s life.83  Yet the cracks in the sexual family model \nwere also clearly visible in the 1990 Act (and before), most notably in the acceptance of the \nseparation of genetic parenthood from intentional\/social parenthood; the formal recognition that \nthe sexual couple (and legal parents) at the heart of the family unit need not be the genetic \nparents of any children of the family;\n84\n and the attribution of fatherhood to a man neither \ngenetically related to the child nor legally connected to the child\u2019s mother.   \n \nHowever, notwithstanding these significant challenges to it, we would suggest that the sexual \nfamily ideal has retained a significant hold, which is clear in the provisions of the 2008 Act.  \nEither because its implicit understanding of the family accorded with their own common sense \nvision of the world or because change was seen as too politically sensitive in this particular \ncontext, the reformers left undisturbed many of the key assumptions, which had underpinned the \noriginal 1990 Act.  This can be seen in: the ongoing significance of the formally recognised adult \ncouple; law\u2019s continued adherence to a two-parent model; what we describe as \u2018parental \ndimorphism\u2019 (which, within the two-parent model, allows only for one mother plus one father or \nfemale parent); and the notion that the couple must be (at least potentially) in a sexual \nrelationship.  We consider each of these factors in more detail below before going on to offer \nsome thoughts on transgender parents\u2019 use of reproductive technologies which, we suggest, \nprovides a further illustration of various tensions and is set to raise thorny legal problems for \nfuture judicial determination.   \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \nwhich allow both parties in a same-sex partnership to have a legally recognised relationship with a child through \nadoption (Adoption and Children Act 2002). \n \n81\n By 2006, 43 per cent of births were to unmarried women compared to a rate of 25 per cent in 1988.  The majority \nof these births are to cohabitees with 86 per cent of non-marital births being jointly registered.  See ONS above n 79 \nat 24.  \n \n82\n While marriage remains popular (284,000 marriages in 2005), the permanence of the union is less certain, with \ndivorce significantly more common (56,000 in 1968, 155,000 in 2005). See ONS ibid, at 20-21. \n \n83\n See e.g. provisions in the Children Act 1989, as amended, relating to parental responsibility and a range of orders \nrelating to children, such as those pertaining to contact and residence. \n \n84\n See above.  See further: J. McCandless, \u2018Status and Anomaly: Re. D (contact and parental responsibility: lesbian \nmothers and known father) [2006]\u2019 (2008) 30 Journal of Social Welfare and Family Law 63. \n \n15 \n \nThe ongoing significance of the formally recognised adult couple \n \nAs we have seen, the 2008 Act maintains the hierarchical structure of the 1990 Act, whereby \nhusbands (and now female civil partners) are given \u2018first shot\u2019 at parental status.85  Only when \nthere is no father or female parent by virtue of this formally recognised relationship,\n86\n are the \ncourts directed to consider whether there is a father or female parent under the agreed parenthood \nprovisions.  As such, while marriage may no longer be the only means of legally recognising an \nadult couple, it retains considerable importance and the extension of the marital presumption to \nfemale civil partners can be seen as assimilation to (and extension of) this marital ideal rather \nthan any radically new way of recognising parent-child legal ties.\n87\n    It is noteworthy, however, \nthat a presumption which used to be grounded in a high probability that the husband was the \ngenetic father is now extended to situations where we know for certain that there is no genetic \nrelationship between parent and child.\n88\n  \n \nWe noted above a further significant distinction between formally recognised and other \npartnerships: parental status is presumed for husbands (and now civil partners) in both licensed \nand self-arranged \u2018artificial insemination\u2019, whereas unmarried\/unregistered partners can gain \nlegal recognition under the 2008 Act only in the context of licensed treatment and only where \nthey satisfy the agreed parenthood conditions.\n89\n  While procedures involving IVF techniques can \nonly occur in a medical setting, practices such as donor insemination do not necessarily require \nmedical assistance.  Although there are no available figures, it seems reasonable to assume that \nthe practice of self-arranged artificial insemination is more common amongst lesbian couples \nthan heterosexual couples and the effects of extending the presumption of parenthood to civil \npartners who arrange their own artificial insemination are thus highly significant.  This extension \nalso poses interesting questions for birth registration procedures in relation to what evidence a \nRegistrar might legitimately request in order to establish that the conception was \u2018artificial\u2019 \n                                                 \n85\n Note that this is also true in the context of surrogacy, where if the birth mother is married or in a civil partnership, \nand the conception is brought about by means other than sexual intercourse, her husband or female partner will be \nthe presumed second parent of the child.  This is true even when the gametes of the commissioning father (or indeed \nmother) are used.  See further E. Jackson, \u2018What is a Parent?\u2019 in A. Diduck and K. O\u2019Donovan (eds), Feminist \nPerspectives on Family Law (Abingdon: Routledge-Cavendish, 2006). \n \n86\n Under s 35 or s 42 respectively. \n \n87\n On the assimilationist model adopted in the Civil Partnership Act 2004, see N. Barker, \u2018For Better or For Worse? \nThe Civil Partnership Bill [HL] 2004\u2019 (2004) 26 Journal of Social Welfare and Family Law 313; C. F. Stychin, \n'\"Las Vegas is not where we are\":  Queer Readings of the Civil Partnership Act', (2006) 25 Political Geography 899. \n \n88\n While ss. 35 and 36 do not affect the pater est presumption, it may be rebutted by evidence (e.g a DNA test) \nshowing that the husband is not the child\u2019s genetic father. In that case, a man in respect of whom the agreed \nfatherhood conditions were satisfied would be the child\u2019s father under s 36. There is no presumption parallel to the \npater est presumption in common law for people who enter a civil partnership and, as such, the provisions which \nwould otherwise apply to determine parenthood will not be affected by the mother entering into a civil partnership \nafter the transfer of an embryo or gametes. \n \n89\n In the context of non-licensed treatment when a woman is neither married nor in a civil partnership, the provider \nof the sperm is the child\u2019s legal parent under the common law.   \n \n16 \n \nrather than through sexual intercourse.\n90\n  That this significant change appears to have passed \nlargely unnoticed is evidence of the lack of scrutiny received by the status provisions, which we \nnoted above.  \n \nThe ongoing distinction drawn between married and unmarried fathers (and, indeed, its extension \nto civil partnered female couples and those not in such a partnership) is interesting in the context \nof widespread erosion of the relevance of this distinction elsewhere in family law, a trend which \ngathered momentum in the 1970s and is currently continued in the Welfare Reform Bill 2009.\n91\n   \nIn the face of such a trend, why did the architects of the reform of the 2008 Act retain and build \non this distinction here?  The roots of this prioritisation of marriage appear to lie in anxieties \nduring the passage of the 1990 Act regarding the use of reproductive technologies and the \nperceived threats which they posed to the nuclear family.\n92\n  Twenty years on, the failure to \nchallenge a distinction which is now even further out of line with current family law and policy \nlies in the constraints on the reform process which we noted above: the 2008 Act is an amending \nstatute, which builds on the structure of the 1990 Act.   Further, reform in this area is conducted \nin the harsh spotlight of media attention: the clear sense of those overseeing the drafting of the \nlegislation was that to challenge the distinction between married and unmarried couples ran the \nrisk of being taken to be attacking marriage and thus liable to attract very hostile coverage.\n93\n  \nThe result is a piece of legislation which, in maintaining a clear distinction between formally \nrecognised and other relationships, is now very significantly out of line with broader family law \nprinciples.   \n \nThe Two Parent Model \n \n                                                 \n90\n The current practice by Registrars is that generally no evidence will be required unless the Registrar has reason to \nbelieve that those persons seeking to register the birth are providing false information.  In correspondence, Trembath \nindicated the following: \u2018As you say, where legal parentage is not conferred on the mother's female partner because \nthey were not in a civil partnership (and the mother was not married), and treatment was not carried out at a clinic in \nthe UK or consent had not been properly given, the partner could not legally be registered as the parent. The \nbiological position would then apply i.e. the man who had intercourse with the mother or donated sperm for a DIY \ninsemination would be the father and could be registered a[s] such. Where there is any dispute between the parties as \nto the means of conception or status of the parents, before registering the birth the registrar will seek further \ninformation or ask to see relevant documentation as appropriate (e.g. confirmation from the clinic of the treatment, \nconsent forms etc) in order to establish the correct parentage. In any circumstances, only two people may be \nregarded as the parents so in a case where all three parties wish to be registered as parents, the registrar will have to \ndefer registration and take whatever action is appropriate to establish the correct parentage.\u2019  While documentation \nmay be available to confirm or deny that treatment took place at a licensed clinic, what the Registrar would ask for \nby way of evidence that conception took place \u2018artificially\u2019 rather than through sexual intercourse in the self-\narranged context remains an interesting empirical question and one that poses the further consideration of what the \ndistinction in the provision actually seeks to achieve.  Trembath, e-mail on file. \n  \n91\n This aims to ensure joint registration of all births and provides that parental responsibility will be automatically \nacquired by an unmarried man (or non-civil partnered female partner) who registers as a child\u2019s father (or female \nparent) under these new provisions: see Sched 6, Part 2, Clause 21.   \n \n92\n See further Dewar, Sheldon, n 60 above. \n \n93\n Webb interview, on file: \u2018if we changed the recognition of married men or marriage, people might see that as the \nGovernment attacking marriage.  So we always have to be mindful of the bigger political picture as well...\u2019   \n17 \n \nIn the context of widespread political and cultural disagreement regarding on what grounds \nparents should be recognised, acceptance of the fact that we can have two \u2013 and only two \u2013 \u2018real\u2019 \nparents has proved a unifying article of faith.\n94\n  The two parent model retains a grip on the law \nwhich appears to have outlived any inevitable relationship between legal parenthood and either \nbiological fact or marital convention.   Significantly, while the reform of s 13(5) ensured that \nthere was sustained attention to the question of whether a child could flourish equally well \nwithout a father (either in a single parent family or raised by a same sex couple), this reform \nprocess saw no discussion of the question of whether, if two parents are better than one, three \nparents might be better than (or, at least, as good as) two. In other contexts, family law has \ndeveloped increasingly flexible and creative ways of recognising a range of adults as of \nsignificance to a child.  To take just two examples: parental responsibility can be awarded to any \nnumber of adults and current adoption practice seeks to maintain links with birth parents \nalongside those with legal\/social parents.\n95\n  Yet it seems that notwithstanding this greater \nflexibility, there remains something special about the legal status of parent and registration as \nsuch on a birth certificate.  The question of whether, in certain circumstances, more than two \nparents might be legally recognised was raised by just one respondent early in the Government \nconsultation process regarding how the 1990 Act should be reformed\n96\n and, although noted in \ntwo consecutive interventions in the House of Lords debates, was not subject to any further \nelaboration.\n97\n  Given that for the vast majority of births only two adults will be involved in the \nchild\u2019s conception, intend to be the parents and be accordingly registered on the birth certificate, \none might be forgiven for assuming that the issue of multiple birth registration simply did not \noccur to the Government as a matter for consideration.  However, the Department of Health told \nus that they had mooted the possibility of a child having three legal parents in the early stages of \nthe reform process and discussed it with the Office for National Statistics.  The idea was rejected \non the basis that the consequences of such a change were too far reaching and controversial, \npotentially \u2018hijacking\u2019 the reform process and jeopardising the Bill.98   \n \nWithin the wide-ranging consequences foreseen by the Department of Health, there may, of \ncourse, be very good reasons for refusing to recognise more than two legal parents.  Perhaps \nmost obviously, such a refusal might be grounded in a concern for the best interests of a child.  \n                                                 \n \n94 \nOn the fact that such claims to authenticity (being a \u2018real\u2019 parent) are grounded in claims to exclusivity (only one \nmother and one father can be \u2018real\u2019 parents), see further Sheldon, n 60 above; Jackson, n 85 above. \n \n95\n See Children Act 1989, s 2 and C.

Sheldon was involved in writing this submission. \n \n97 Per Baroness O\u2019Neill of Bengarve and Baroness Baker, HL Deb vol 696 col 858-861 (21 November 2007). \n \n98\n The Department of Health also clearly felt that a statute aimed at a very specific area of law was not the right \nplace to introduce wide-ranging reform of fundamental family law principles: \u2018Three people wanting to parent a \nchild ... there is nothing necessarily wrong with it, it\u2019s just the whole concept of parenthood would be altered with \nhuge cost ...\u2019, Skinner, interview on file; \u2018all of a sudden a child\u2019s got three parents? Let\u2019s try to stick to ... the \nstructure we\u2019ve already got\u2019, Webb, interview on file. \n \n18 \n \nWe might worry that potential conflict would inevitably follow from a multiplication of the \nnumber of parents, or that a child with three parents might find the arrangement confusing or \nface stigma from peers.  These are, however, empirical concerns which, to the best of our \nknowledge, have not been investigated and thus remain entirely speculative.  The Department of \nHealth\u2019s early policy decision and lack of further attention to this issue signals just how \ningrained in our collective imagination is the notion that a child has only two parents, even in the \ncontext of assisted reproduction where more than two people may contribute biologically to the \nreproductive process.  Indeed, as was noted above and is further discussed below, the possibility \nthat two women might both lay claim to be recognised as mothers on the basis of biological links \n(leaving a third party to claim fatherhood or female parenthood) was considered worthy of \nspecific exclusion.  It is also clear that any attempt to introduce a third parent onto the birth \ncertificate was seen as very difficult to implement in political terms, invoking the remit of a large \nnumber of different Government departments.\n99\n  \n \nThe limited amount of consideration given to the advantages and disadvantages of recognising \nmore than two parents is particularly interesting given that a growing number of other \njurisdictions have begun to countenance such a possibility.  The New Zealand Law Commission \nhas recommended changes to the law to permit a child to have three legal parents in certain \nreproductive contexts: notably, when a couple conceive a child with a known donor\n100\n and in \nsituations whereby the wrong gametes have been used in treatment procedures.\n101\n The New \nZealand Government has resolved to give these recommendations further consideration.\n102\n In \nCanada, the Ontario Court of Appeal has ruled that it could bridge a \u2018legislative gap\u2019 in the \nChildren\u2019s Law Reform Act 1990 by allowing a child to have three registered legal parents.103  \nAgain, this was in the context of a lesbian couple conceiving a child with a known donor and the \nOntario Court found that not to allow the child\u2019s non-biological mother also to register as the \nchild\u2019s legal parent along with the biological parents was a violation of her rights under the \nCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n104\n  Meanwhile, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania \n                                                 \n99\n Willis, Skinner, interview on file.

The Law Commission\u2019s Report also notes that although the New \nZealand courts have never recognised a child as having more than two legal parents it has, in H v Y [2005] NZFLR \n152, paved the way for a declaration of paternity to be issued in relation to an adopted person who already has a \nlegal father.  No legal rights or responsibilities would, however, flow from this declaration. \n \n102\n Ministry of Justice, Government Response to the Law Commission Report on New Issues in Legal Parenthood \n(2006), paras 23-27 and 33-34.   \n \n103\n In AA v BB (2007) ONCA 2. \n \n104\n Specifically her rights to equality and fundamental justice under ss 15 and 7 respectively. \n \n19 \n \nhas held that a child may have three legal parents for the purposes of child support.\n105\n  In all \nthese examples, how it may be beneficial for a child to have three registered legal parents was \ndiscussed, moving the deliberations on this issue beyond mere assumption that it would in some \nway be harmful.\n106\n  Yet in the UK, despite the lack of political or cultural consensus on what \nactually makes someone a parent, the idea that a child benefit from having more than two parents \nappears to have been too radical to have merited any discussion in this context, leaving the \nreformers to rely on the sexual family \u2018two parent\u2019 model as the default option.   \n \n \n\u2018Parental dimorphism\u2019: one mother plus one father\/female parent  \n \nFurther, while English law has become increasingly open to the idea that a child can have two \nparents of the same gender, the sexual family model continues to resonate in a steadfast \nresistance to the possibility that a child can have two \u2018mothers\u2019 (or indeed two \u2018fathers\u2019).107  The \ntwo parent model thus also appears to encompass an assumption of what might be loosely termed \n\u2018parental dimorphism\u2019, by which we mean that the two parents are seen as occupying \ncomplementary yet different legal roles.  This was seen above in the fact that a lesbian co-mother \nis not to be legally recognised as a \u2018mother\u2019 (a status reserved for the woman who has gestated a \npregnancy) but as a \u2018female parent\u2019 (a status awarded on grounds which closely parallel those by \nwhich men obtain fatherhood).  The 2008 Act further provides that references elsewhere in law \nto \u2018father\u2019 should be taken to include \u2018female parent\u2019.108   \n \nThis points to another significant dimension of the sexual family: that it is rooted in the idea of \ncomplementarity, assuming a fundamental difference in how parental status is acquired.\n109\n  As \nhas been seen above, motherhood is firmly grounded in gestation (and this holds significance per \n                                                 \n105\n Jennifer L. Shultz-Jacob v Jodilynn Jacob and Carl Frampton [2007] PA Super 118.  It is here interesting to note \nthat if the Welfare Reform Bill (2009) is passed in its current form, it would seem to prohibit such a possibility.  See \nSched 6, Part 1, clause 4 and clause 13 (inserting ss 2E, 10B and 10C into the Births and Deaths Registration Act \n1953), which would allow for the re-registration of a birth only when the birth is solely registered by the mother. \n \n106\n McCandless has elsewhere discussed this in the context of a recent application for parental responsibility by a \nknown donor that was objected to by the lesbian couple who were the primary carers of the child: n 84 above. \n  \n107\n Note that adoption certificates use the gender neutral terminology of \u2018parent\u2019 for each parent rather than \u2018mother\u2019 \nand \u2018father\u2019.  This meant that following the changes in the Adoption and Children Act 2002, which permit a same-\nsex couple to adopt a child together, the semantics of \u2018mother\/mother\u2019 or \u2018father\/father\u2019 were avoided.  Trembath, e-\nmail on file. \n \n108\n See the changes made to the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 and other relevant legislation by Sched 6, \nPart 1 of the 2008 Act (and Part 2 for enactments relating only to Scotland).   A further question which arises was \nwhether, rather than providing for these separate gendered statuses, the law might simply have moved to a position \nof \u2018parent one\u2019 and \u2018parent two\u2019.  Yet as Skinner told us: \u2018We didn\u2019t want to take away the term \u2018mother\u2019 or the term \n\u2018father\u2019, which are emotive terms for most people and they would want to keep them for heterosexual couples and \nwomen would want to keep \u2018mother\u2019.\u2019  Interview, on file.    \n \n109\n Although Fineman is more concerned with the gendered imagery of the sexual family in relation to care-work, as \nopposed to how it plays out in the attribution of legal parenthood per se, this sense of complementarity appears to be \nan implicit part of the sexual family model, which in its pure form requires a male and female parent, each of whom \nis genetically related to the child.  \n  \n20 \n \nse, rather than merely standing as a proxy for a genetic link).\n110\n  Law\u2019s interest in genetic links \nhas thus tended to be focussed on fathers.\n111\n  Indeed, as noted above, the possibility of acquiring \neither motherhood or \u2018female parenthood\u2019 through a genetic link is explicitly addressed \u2013 and \nexcluded \u2013 in the 2008 Act.112  The grounds for such exclusion are not readily evident.  No \nrationale was given for it in the explanatory notes accompanying the 2008 Act and there is no \ndiscussion of it in the Parliamentary debates,\n113\n suggesting that it either passed unnoticed or was \nfelt to be entirely uncontroversial.  Two explanations were offered for the provision during the \ncourse of our interviews.  First, and almost certainly most significantly, was the perceived need \nto avoid any future possibility that two women might each claim to be recognised as the mother \nof a child citing, respectively, gestational and genetic connections.  Such claims would be most \nlikely to arise in the context of a lesbian couple who wish both to enjoy a biological connection \nwith a future child and therefore choose to create an embryo from one partner\u2019s ova, which will \nbe implanted in the other partner.\n114\n As we noted above, recognising two women as parents in \nthis way would leave open the possibility that a third party might also attempt to assert legal \nparenthood.  Second, it was suggested to us that the provision might reflect concerns about \nmitochondrial DNA donation, seeking to head off the possibility that a donor might assert some \nparental claims on this basis.\n115\n  While such a provision appears unnecessary given the clear \ndefinitions of legal motherhood and female parenthood provided in the statute, this section might \nbe taken as providing what one interviewee suggested to be \u2018clarity\u2019 and, another, a \u2018belt and \nbraces\u2019 approach.116  \n \nWhether legally necessary or not, this explicit rebuttal of any possibility that female parenthood \nmight be grounded in genetic links serves to emphasise the distinction between how we think \n                                                 \n110\n As might have been thought to be implied by the phrase, mater est quam gestatio demonstrate (is gestation \nnothing more than the demonstration of a genetic connection?).    \n \n111\n This is not to deny that law recognises other genetic links: e.g. in inheritance law and incest prohibitions.  \nFurther, as noted above, the 2008 Act increases the rights of children born of gamete donation to trace their (half-) \nsiblings: see Jones, n 46 above. \n \n112\n s 47.   \n \n113\n When this provision was discussed at Committee stage in the House of Commons the only question posed in \nrelation to it was whether children born through egg donation would have a similar right of access to information as \nchildren born through the use of donated sperm.  See per Mark Simmonds MP, Commons Committee Stage Debate, \n7\nth\n Sitting, col 240 (12 June 2008).   \n \n114\n Webb confirmed this understanding: \u2018it is about a very clear principle that the woman that gives birth is the \nmother and that\u2019s it... There was something about the need to make it absolutely clear that where we have two \nwomen in a relationship and one provides the egg to the other and she gives birth that it would be absolutely clear, in \nthat situation, the donor is not the mother.\u2019  Interview on file. \n \n115\n Willis, interview on file.  Beyond s 47, we saw further anxiety associated with female procreativity in the Joint \nCommittee\u2019s recommendation that an embryo made from the genetic material of two women alone should be \nprohibited for use in treatment and that, in the case of mitochondrial donation, the child would have only two legal \nparents. JC Report, paras 186 and 307. \n  \n116\n Skinner, Jackson, interviews on file.   As Jackson went on to acknowledge, this flies against a received principle \nof statutory interpretation: that the draftsman should be taken not to have included unnecessary words in a statute. \n \n21 \n \nabout motherhood and fatherhood: while genetic connections are very relevant to establishing \nfatherhood, legal motherhood is a status emphatically grounded in gestation.\n117\n  This distinction \nin how men and women are able to acquire parental status has a significant impact in practice.  \nImagine a non-civil partnered lesbian couple, Jacqui and Jill, who both wish to enjoy a biological \nconnection with a jointly planned child and thus decide that Jacqui will donate an egg that will \nbe fertilised with donor semen, with the resulting embryo implanted into Jill.  Jill will thus be the \nchild\u2019s legal mother and Jacqui can achieve female parenthood on the basis of an agreement with \nJill, which meets the statutorily prescribed conditions.   However, now imagine that Jacqui and \nJill separate before an embryo is implanted.  Jacqui can of course ask the clinic to destroy the \nstored embryos which were created using her eggs.\n118\n  However, if she fails to do so there is \nnothing to prevent Jill from informing the clinic that she no longer wishes Jacqui to be the agreed \nsecond parent and having these embryos implanted (with or without another partner recognised \nas legal father\/female parent).  Although the clinic has an obligation to take \u2018reasonable steps\u2019 to \ninform Jacqui before the embryos are used (thus giving her the opportunity to withdraw consent), \nthere is no prohibition on use of the embryos if such \u2018reasonable steps\u2019 do not result in contact \nbeing established.\n119\n  As such, if the agreed parenthood conditions are no longer met (e.g. \nbecause Jill has informed the clinic that she no longer wishes Jacqui to be the agreed second \nparent or because she has formed a legally binding agreement with a new partner), Jacqui might \nthus find herself in a position where she has no legal rights at all with regard to the genetic child \nthat she jointly planned with Jill.\n120\n  \n \nA man who has contributed sperm to create an embryo to be implanted in his partner would not \nfind himself in a similar position because he would achieve fatherhood not on the basis of the \nagreed fatherhood conditions but on the basis of his genetic connection with the resulting child, \nas per the common law.  This points to a broader problem with the current framing of the agreed \nfemale parenthood provisions, which seek to extend legal recognition to lesbian co-parents on \nexactly parallel conditions to those by which men acquire legal recognition as fathers: in some \ninstances, parallel treatment will deliver unequal results because men and women are not \nsimilarly (biologically) situated with regard to reproduction.  It is noteworthy that while there \nwas some, albeit limited, discussion regarding whether \u2018female parents\u2019 ought to be recognised \nat all, once that decision was made, how one might seek to frame such recognition appears to \nhave received very little critical scrutiny, with our interviewees generally perplexed by the \n                                                 \n117 \n On this, see further, Sheldon, n 60 above at 546-7.  For the contention that greater weight should be placed on the \ngenetic tie for all parents, see A. Samuels \u2018The Surrogate Child: Who is his or her Mother and Who is the Father?\u2019 \n(2000) 68 Medico-Legal Journal 65.   \n \n118\n As per the consent provisions contained in Sched 3. \n \n119\n S 14(6E) 1990 Act, as amended.  See further above, n 66. \n \n120\n  It is interesting to speculate whether Jacqui might invoke a Human Rights Act challenge on such a set of facts.  \nJacqui\u2019s Article 8 privacy rights appear to be clearly engaged in such a context.  Can she also produce a convincing \nargument under Article 14 that she is discriminated against relative to a man (who, where he is the genetic father of \nthe child, would not be caught by these provisions in the same way)?    \n \n22 \n \nquestion of whether this might have been done in any other way.\n121\n  The Department of Health \nreported a strategy of working outwards from the provisions for heterosexual couples to ensure \n\u2018complete equality between the two\u2019:  \n \nSo, we started with married couples and then read across to civil partners, and then having done something \nfor civil partners,  we considered the position of unmarried heterosexual couples and the  \u2018treated together\u2019 \nprovision ... [Notes the imprecision of the \u2018treatment together\u2019 test and the welcome opportunity to tighten \nup that wording] ... We\u2019ve got a more precise provision now of signing a fatherhood agreement before \ninsemination or embryo transfer, which can be withdrawn before that takes place ... And, having done that \nfor unmarried heterosexual couples,  we considered the position of non-civil partners and introduced the \nparental agreement there.  That was the process.\n122\n \n \nThe Department also reported that it had met several times to discuss the reform with Stonewall, \na group which has been subject to some criticism for its assimilationist approach to the \nrecognition of same sex relationships.\n123\n  The small number of LGBT groups that replied to the \nconsultation exercises noted above applauded the extension of parental recognition, with no \ncritical comment as to its form,\n124\n and there was similarly little discussion in the Science and \nTechnology Committee, Joint Committee or in Parliament on this question.  Yet as Diduck has \nexplored in a different context, there are grounds to be wary of any straightforward assumption \nthat lesbian families are \u2018just like other families\u2019.  The differences in how lesbian couples may \nchoose to structure their parenting arrangements are crucial and Diduck suggests that law needs \nto recognise this difference rather than simply viewing it as a distraction.\n125\n   \n \nFinally, it is also worth pausing to consider where gay men figure in this extension of parental \nrecognition through the status provisions.  To our knowledge, this issue was raised only once in \nthe entire, extensive reform process described above and then by a respondent who was arguing \n                                                 \n121\n The Department of Health told us that they described to their lawyers what they wanted to achieve in practice, \nand the lawyers produced the text of the agreed fatherhood and female parenthood conditions. Webb, interview on \nfile. \n \n122\n Webb, interview on file.  \n \n123\n For a critique of Stonewall as advocating a model of reform that tends to promote formal equality in a socially \nconservative, assimiliationist way, see Stychin, n 87 above. \n \n124\n e.g. the only LGBT group who replied to the JC\u2019s consultation was the Equality Network (ev 33), a network of \nScottish organisations working for LGBT equality.  The Network\u2019s submission welcomed the proposal to remove \nsexual orientation discrimination from the Act, noting that \u2018the principle of treating the civil partner of a mother in \nthe same way as the husband of a mother, and treating a \u201cnon-civil-partnered\u201d same-sex partner the same as an \nunmarried mixed-sex partner, is now well established in other law.  It is also supported by the increasing amount of \nevidence on outcomes for children of same-sex parents...\u2019 JC Vol 2, at 353. \n \n125\n A. Diduck, n.77 above.  Diduck\u2019s own brief discussion of Part 2 of the 2008 Act is unsurprisingly highly critical.  \nJenni Millbank makes a similar point in an insightful recent overview of lesbian and gay intra-familial disputes in a \nnumber of western nations, noting that: \u2018Many parenting reforms have proceeded under an equal treatment \napproach, analogising co-mothers with the position of non-biological parents in heterosexual families.  There is \nmuch appeal in such an approach, which I am not necessarily criticising, however it has produced very little \nengagement with the underlying principles or discussion of the \u2018fit\u2019 in its application to lesbian-led families.\u2019 See J. \nMillbank, \u2018The Limits of Functional Family: Lesbian Mother Litigation in the Era of the Eternal Biological Family\u2019 \n(2008) 22 International Journal of Law, Policy and the Family 149, at 169. \n \n23 \n \nfor a more conservative approach to reform.\n126\n  Gay men do benefit from the extension of the \npossibility of obtaining a \u2018fast track\u2019 adoption following surrogacy;127 however it seems not to \nhave been considered that the status provisions might be further adapted to allow two men to be \nrecognised as parents from the moment of birth.  Again, this can be explained through the \ntenacious hold of the two-parent sexually dimorphic family model on our thinking.  Within this \nmodel, at least as it has played out in the UK context, motherhood is grounded in gestation.  In \n1990, the law took a step away from the \u2018pure\u2019 form of the sexual family, by recognising that a \nwoman\u2019s partner might be recognised as the legal father even if not the genetic father of her \nchild, on the basis of his relationship to the woman and his intention to create a child.  Given the \noperation of the longstanding previous legal presumption of pater est, this was not such a large \nchange.\n128\n  In the 2008 Act, this shift is extended one step further: similarly to recognise a \nwoman\u2019s female partner.  However, to recognise two gay men as parents under the status \nprovisions would be a significant step further again, and one which simply stretches the current \nlegal imagination too far, as it would involve moving beyond the idea that the birth mother is a \nlegal mother (or, alternatively, recognising three parents from the moment of birth).  While the \nlaw in this area has been open to the idea that fatherhood can be grounded in intention (and \navoided on the same basis), the same has been less true of motherhood.\n129\n  Thus, given the \nresistance to recognising more than two parents, gay men are squeezed out of the picture.   \n \nThe (potentially) sexual couple \n \nAs noted above, husbands and civil partners have \u2018first shot\u2019 at obtaining legal parenthood along \nwith the child\u2019s birth mother. Such couples will normally be in a sexually intimate relationship130 \n                                                 \n126\n Brenda Almond, an emeritus Professor of Philosophy suggested that \u2018caution is needed when tampering with \nsomething as fundamental as having a parent of each sex\u2019.  She notes that while the changes to the status provisions \nare proposed in the name of gender equality, the principle is applied inconsistently, with the Bill\u2019s proposals \ncouched entirely in terms of women.  She concludes that \u2018[a]ny reasoning that could justify these proposals in \nrespect of women could equally justify similar arrangements for men.\u2019 Her argument would appear to have been \nintended to function as a reductio ad absurdum.  JC, Vol 2, Ev 21 at 2.2. \n \n127 \n See s 54 2008 Act, extending the category of couples who can apply for a parental order (fast track adoption) \nfollowing surrogacy to civil partners, and unmarried opposite sex couples and non-civil partners who are an \n\u2018enduring family relationship\u2019 and not in prohibited degrees of relationship to each other. In contrast with adoption, \nsingle people cannot apply for a parental order. \n \n128\n While the marital presumption could be rebutted by evidence establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the \nhusband could not be the father, the law for many years refused in the interests of public decency to allow either \nparty to give evidence that they had not had intercourse at the relevant time: see Cretney n 78 above at 533-6 for a \ndetailed and insightful discussion of the case law. \n \n129\n Gillian Douglas has suggested that focussing on intention reflects a very male way of thinking about parenthood \nand US author Karen Czapanskiy expresses a similar idea in a different context, suggesting that while women are \n\u2018draftees\u2019 into parenthood, men are \u2018volunteers\u2019.   G. Douglas, \u2018The Intention to be a Parent and the Making of \nMothers\u2019 (1994) 57 MLR 636; K. Czapanskiy \u2018Volunteers and Draftees: The Struggle for Parental Equality\u2019 (1991) \n38 University of California Los Angeles Law Review 415.  On the need for a conceptual division between maternity \nand motherhood see K. O\u2019Donovan and J. Marshall, \u2018After Birth: Decisions About Becoming a Mother\u2019 in Diduck \nand O\u2019Donovan, n 85 above. \n \n130\n Note that lack of consummation remains as a ground for annulment of a marriage.  No similar provision is made \nwith regard to civil partnership, although see N. Barker, 'Sex and the Civil Partnership Act: The Future of  \n24 \n \nand must, at least, be lawfully permitted to be so: marriage and civil partnership are not open to \nthose in the prohibited degrees of relationship foreseen in incest legislation.\n131\n  As we have seen, \nthose who do not achieve fatherhood\/female parenthood through a formally recognised union, \ncan do so through the agreed fatherhood and female parenthood conditions.  While these were \nclearly designed to cater for couples, they are not explicitly restricted to those in a sexually \nintimate relationship.\n132\n  However, as we noted above, legal recognition under these provisions \ncannot be accorded to those who fall within the prohibited degrees of relationship with the \nchild\u2019s mother, as foreseen in incest legislation.  There is nothing in the published deliberations \nregarding the rationale for including the incest prohibition and no significant discussion of this \nprovision in the parliamentary debates, suggesting its inclusion to be uncontroversial and thus to \nrequire no elucidation.  The prohibition also occurs in adoption regulation, and it is clear that this \nwas an important influence on the drafters\u2019 decision to include it here.133  Such a prohibition is \nunlikely to be grounded in eugenic considerations, which do not arise in cases of gamete \ndonation.  Rather, as one of the senior civil servants whom we interviewed at the Department of \nHealth put it:  \n \nyou\u2019ve got incest from the point of view of genetic material being damaged ... but then is there just \ngenerally an idea of something not quite being right about a mother and sister raising a child together, in a \nlegally recognised partnership?  So that\u2019s why we looked at adoption.  That\u2019s where we could draw the \ncomparison.\n134\n \n \nTo recognise as legal parents two people who ought not to be involved in a sexual relationship \nbecause of existing kinship relationships would, it appears, offend some deeply held but unstated \nvalue, confusing our ideas about family.  Thus, while we suggested above that the two parent \nmodel might be seen as having outlived its moorings in the heterosexual couple, the sexual \nfamily model continues here to frame our understanding in so far as the couple at the heart of the \nfamily remains a sexual one. \nIt is worth pausing to consider here the self-evident necessity of this provision.  Why is it that a \nmother and daughter should not both be legally recognised as parents?  We know that these kinds \nof collaborative parenting arrangements occur as a matter of social fact: for example, where a \nmother and father raise a child with their own daughter, who has become pregnant at a young age \nwhilst still living at home.  Many would see this as the ideal arrangement in which a teenage \nmother might raise her child and certainly would not see anything wrong in her own parents \ntaking on a substantial parenting role with respect to the new baby.  What then is different about \nallowing individuals in these kinds of relationships to choose to create a child together, and \n                                                                                                                                                             \nNon-Conjugality' (2006) 14 Feminist Legal Studies 241, for an argument that this has more to do with a political \nreluctance to discuss same-sex sex than the idea that civil partnerships would not entail a sexual relationship. \n \n131\n See n 68 above.  \n \n132\n As was noted above, the fact that the provision was not restricted to \u2018partners\u2019 was only noticed by many \nrelatively late in the reform process. \n \n133\n Skinner, interview on file. \n \n134\n Webb, interview on file. \n \n25 \n \nrecognising all of them on a birth certificate?  It is clear from the discussion above that the \nanswer cannot lie in the fact that we believe legal parenthood should always follow genetic links \nor that it is dependent in some way on a marital relationship between the parents. \nOne interesting case which might offer a useful prompt to tease out intuitions was reported under \nthe title, \u2018Sisters make baby with three mums\u2019.135  Alex was infertile as a result of chemotherapy.  \nWhen she and her husband decided to start a family, her twin sister, Charlotte, agreed to donate \nan egg, while her other sister, Helen, offered to gestate the pregnancy.  The resulting child, \nCharlie, was thus created from Charlotte's egg and Alex's husband's sperm, and gestated by \nHelen.  The report which accompanies this story on the BBC website is accompanied by a \npicture of a smiling Alex holding Charlie, and flanked by her two sisters.  Whilst there is no way \nof knowing the extent to which the positive tone of the BBC report might be representative of \nbroader opinion, it is noteworthy that the story represents these events as a laudable act of \nfamilial support, rather than one which suggests concerns for the future wellbeing of Charlie, \nwho will, after all, be raised within the confines of a (hetero)sexual family unit.  However, would \nreactions to this story be different if the three sisters lived together and intended collectively to \nraise him, having chosen this method of conception in order that they each might have a \nsignificant connection with Charlie (as primary carer, genetic and gestational parent), which they \nwould wish to see legally recognised?  Would the idea that Charlie had \u2018three mums\u2019 become \nless palatable in such a case?  And, if so, is there a solid ethical underpinning for such an \nintuition, which merits its translation into legal prohibition?   \nOur purpose here is not to offer a normative evaluation of the merits of the inclusion of the incest \nprohibition but to highlight that these kinds of normative questions were only addressed in a very \nlimited way in this reform process.  Any possibility that we might extend parenthood to two \nindividuals who were already in a close kinship relationship appears to have been self-evidently \nwrong to the law-makers. Read alongside the guidance which the HFEA has provided on how \nclinicians should interpret the newly revised welfare clause, it appears that while it may be \ndesirable for a woman\u2019s family to help her to raise a child, it is not similarly acceptable for \nfamily members to seek to create a child together, or at least not in a way that is formally \nrecognised through law.\n136\n \nTransgender parents \n                                                 \n135\n \u2018ONE life -Three Sisters Make One Baby\u2019, BBC 1 (31 October 2005).  See the accompanying report on the BBC \nwebsite: \u2018Sisters make baby with three mums\u2019, http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/health\/4370804.stm (last accessed 12 May \n2008). \n \n136\n The recently published latest edition of the Code of Practice advises clinics that where they have some cause for \nconcern regarding a woman\u2019s ability to provide \u2018supportive parenting\u2019 (as required by s 13(5), as amended), they \nmay also take account of support offered by family and friends.  The following definition of \u2018supportive parenting\u2019 \nis given: \u2018commitment to the health, well being and development of the child. It is presumed that all prospective \nparents will be supportive parents, in the absence of any reasonable cause for concern that any child who may be \nborn, or any other child, may be at risk of significant harm or neglect.  Where centres have concern as to whether \nthis commitment exists, they may wish to take account of wider family and social networks within which the child \nwill be raised.\u2019 HFEA Code of Practice (8th Edition), at para 8.11. \n26 \n \nWe end this consideration of the \u2018sexual family\u2019 underpinnings of the 2008 Act, by considering \nthe case of transgender parents, who offer a further illustration of some of the tensions described \nabove and, we would suggest, a store of thorny problems for future judicial determination.  Take \nthe case of X, a female-to-male transsexual and his (female) partner, Y, who had together \nobtained infertility treatment services using donor semen.\n137\n  X had been present throughout Y\u2019s \ntreatment, had acknowledged himself to be the father of any children conceived and was now \nplaying an active parenting role.  Nonetheless, he was told that he could not be registered on the \nbirth certificate of the resulting child, Z.  X took his case to the European Court of Human \nRights, where he lost.\n138\n   \n \nUnder the 2008 Act, a future X would be able to register as a female parent.   And further \ndevelopments since his case was heard would also offer him a second, potentially more \nattractive, possibility.  At the time that X went to the courts, English law defined a person\u2019s sex \nby reference to biological criteria at birth and allowed no possibility for it to be subsequently \nreassigned.\n139\n  This position has now been radically altered by the Gender Recognition Act 2004 \n(\u2018the 2004 Act\u2019) which, under certain conditions, allows for legal recognition of an individual\u2019s \nnew gender.  This allows for X to become legally a man, should he so choose, and therefore to be \nin a position to achieve legal recognition as a father.  Previous parental roles are not affected by \nsuch a change,\n140\n raising the intriguing possibility that a female-to-male transsexual might \nsimultaneously be a mother to children born prior to gender reassignment and a father to those \nconceived afterwards via infertility treatment services.  Likewise, a male-to-female transsexual \nmight be a father to children born before reassignment and a \u2018female parent\u2019 to those born after \nit.  However, the correct terminology for someone who is now a male \u2018mother\u2019 or female \u2018father\u2019 \nremains elusive.  A Conservative MP who raised this issue in the debates which preceded the \n2004 Act\u2019s introduction in the House of Commons received a somewhat evasive response from \nthe Government:   \n \n[Widdecome]: If a woman who has lived her life as a woman, has been registered at birth as a woman and \nhas borne children decides that she wishes to change gender to become fully a man, and the birth certificate \nis rewritten to reflect that, who is the legal mother of those children? \n \n                                                 \n \n137\n X, Y and Z v the UK (1997) 24 ECHR 143. \n \n138 \nThe majority of the Court held that while his privacy rights under Article 8 were engaged, they had not been \nviolated.  Any potential disadvantages suffered by the applicants were limited since X was not prevented from \nacting as a social father and could apply for a joint residence order, which would give him parental responsibility.  \nOne of the judges commented that \u2018it is self-evident that a person who is manifestly not the father of a child has no \nright to be recognised as her father.\u2019 Ibid, at 175.  See A. Bainham, \u2018Sex, Gender and Fatherhood: Does Biology \nReally Matter?\u2019 (1997) 56 Cambridge Law Journal 512 at 515.  More recently, in Goodwin v UK [2002] 2 FLR 487 \nand I v UK [2002] 2 FLR 518, the Court has found that a failure to recognise a change in status for post-operative \ntranssexuals no longer fell within a State\u2019s margin of appreciation, as an emerging consensus in favour of granting \nlegal recognition could be discerned. \n \n139\n Corbett v Corbett [1970] 2 All ER 33, R v Tan [1983] QB 1053, B v B [2001] 1 FLR 389. \n \n140\n s 12, 2004 Act.   \n \n27 \n \n[Lammy]: She is the parent of those children and she has acquired a new gender.\n141\n \n \nIn his resort to the gender neutral term, \u2018parent\u2019, David Lammy appears to sense a safer way of \ndescribing the post-operative parental relationship, avoiding the conclusion that a child could \nhave no legal mother but rather two legal fathers or vice-versa.  The same semantic strategy is \ninvoked in the context of same-sex adoption, where a couple will find themselves each registered \nas a child\u2019s \u2018parent\u2019.  This avoids a direct challenge to the parental dimorphism noted above and \nside-steps the issue of whether being a \u2018father\u2019 or \u2018mother\u2019 means nothing more than being a \nmale or female parent or whether \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018father\u2019 are distinct and complementary roles, \nwith distinct accompanying social expectations.\n142\n \n \nIt is likely that transgender parents will pose further significant challenges for the courts charged \nwith interpreting the 2008 Act in the future.  Another case recently reported in the British press \nconcerned Thomas Beatie, an American transgender man who, despite having undergone gender \nreassignment (legally and physically), had retained the ability to gestate a pregnancy and, faced \nwith his wife\u2019s inability to do so, decided to become pregnant.  He has since given birth to a \ndaughter and is expecting a second child.  Beatie is certainly not the first transgender man to give \nbirth,\n143\n though it is possible that he is the first legally recognised as such to do so.  Given that \nunder the 2004 Act a person can become legally male while still retaining their female \nreproductive capacity,\n144\n Beatie\u2019s case illustrates some problems which may yet come to be \nfaced by the UK courts.   \n \nFirst, ought a clinic in the UK attempt to help such a couple to have a child and should the HFEA \nlicense such treatment?\n145\n Having been refused by several clinics, Beatie and his wife resorted to \nhome insemination following the purchase of anonymous sperm from a commercial sperm \nbank.\n146\n  This echoes the experiences of a Spanish transgender man, Rub\u00e9n No\u00e9 Coronado \n                                                 \n141\n HC Debs vol 418 col 52 (23 Feb 2004). David Lammy was then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for \nConstitutional Affairs. \n \n142\n This in turn begs the question of whether \u2018fathering\u2019 and \u2018mothering\u2019 are distinctive styles of parenting, typically \nassociated with men and women respectively but amenable to being performed by individuals of either gender, i.e. \nfathering may be associated with authority, discipline and certain activities (e.g. sport), with mothering associated \nwith nurturing, hands on caring and so on.  On such a definition, clearly men can mother and women can father \n(though it should be noted that the latter term is typically used to suggest a biological role rather than a social one). \nOn this point, see further A. Doucet, Do Men Mother? (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2006). \n \n143\n See further S. Dylan Moore, \u2018The Pregnant Man \u2013 An Oxymoron?\u2019 (1998) 7 Journal of Gender Studies 319.  \nNote, however, that unlike Beatie, most transgender men will either have given birth long before transition or will \ndelay transition in order to do so. \n \n144\n The 2004 Act does not require sterilisation as a precondition to obtaining a Gender Recognition Certificate. \n  \n145\n Note that licensed treatment is the only way to access medically vetted sperm in the UK, which, unlike the USA \ndoes not permit for the sale of cryopreserved sperm on a commercial basis.  As such, any person who resorts to self \narranged insemination in the UK must use fresh sperm, with the inherent medical risks that this might potentially \nbring. \n \n146\n As reported in Thomas Beatie\u2019s first person account to The Advocate magazine, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.advocate.com\/exclusive_detail_ektid52947.asp (last accessed 16 April 2009).  A total of nine doctors \nwere involved in initial requests.  Beatie further comments: \u2018Doctors have discriminated against us, turning us away \n28 \n \nJim\u00e9nez, who reportedly contacted 158 clinics in Spain before finding one which was prepared \nto treat him before he underwent full surgical reassignment.\n147\n  Yet despite the evident \ndiscomfort some people felt at the idea of a man being visibly pregnant, Beatie and his wife are \ncausing no direct harm to anyone else, appearing merely to have the same desire as many other \ncouples to share genetic and gestational connections with their child.\n148\n   \n \nSecondly, if such a procedure were permitted in the UK, who would be recognised as the parents \nof that child?  The man who has gestated the pregnancy should presumably be seen as the child\u2019s \nmother, though whether that is compatible with his status as a man is unclear.\n149\n  Likewise, if a \nmale-to-female transsexual has stored sperm prior to reassignment which is then used to \nimpregnate a female partner, would she be the child\u2019s \u2018father\u2019 or \u2018female parent\u2019, and will this \ndepend on the genetic connection or the person\u2019s current legal gender?  And if womb transplants \nbecome possible in the future, could she ask to make use of the sperm to create an embryo which \nshe could then gestate herself?\n150\n \n \nOther authors have already provided an interesting analysis of the reproductive possibilities at \nplay here and the extent to which the 2008 Act would struggle to address them.\n151\n  Our own aim \nis merely to provide one further example of how the \u2018sexual family\u2019 notion struggles to \naccommodate such possibilities.  Indeed, the questions posed by transgender parenthood serve to \nilluminate many of the tensions inherent in continuing to map our legal determinations of \nparenthood to a family model that is unmoored from its traditional underpinnings. Once the \nvarious constituent elements of the family form envisaged in the sexual family model are no \n                                                                                                                                                             \ndue to their religious beliefs. Health care professionals have refused to call me by a male pronoun or recognize \nNancy as my wife. Receptionists have laughed at us.\u2019 \n \n147\n D. Fuchs, \u2018Transsexual man expecting twins sparks ethical row\u2019, The Guardian 30 March 2009. As in the Beatie \ncase, Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s female partner is unable to bear a child.  \n \n148 \nThough some will no doubt speculate regarding the welfare of a future child, who will come to learn that s\/he was \ngestated by her \u2018father\u2019.  See Dylan Moore, above n 143, for an empirical consideration of the tensions between \ngender identity and the desire to have a genetically related child.  Note also J v C and E (A Child) [2006] EWCA \nCiv 551 for a recent judicial consideration of the issue, with Wall LJ stating that had the applicant in this case, a \nfemale-to-male transsexual, revealed the truth about his gender to a fertility clinic, \u2018the clinic would have plainly \nrisked the forfeiture of its license had it provided treatment services for them\u2019 (at para 25).  In this case the applicant \nmerely sought treatment as a man along with his female partner, rather than treatment that would enable him to \nbecome pregnant.  While it is certainly likely that the deception in this case by the applicant \u2013 he had kept his gender \ntransition a secret from his partner \u2013 influenced Wall LJ, his assertion might be read as revealing a more general \nconcern about the desirability of transgender persons receiving fertility treatment. \n \n149\n In the case discussed above, which was decided prior to the introduction of the Gender Recognition Act (2004), \nthe European Court of Human Rights was not prepared to recognise that someone who was still, legally, a woman \ncould be a child\u2019s father: X, Y and Z v UK (App no 21830\/93) (1997) 24 EHRR 143, [1997] 2 FLR 892. \n150\n The possibility of womb transplants may not be too distant: W.

Further, \nthe transgender example illustrates well the extent of the challenges that the use of reproductive \ntechnologies pose to current understandings of parenthood and how many of these have passed \nunaddressed in this reform process and the revised legislation resulting from it.\n152\n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nIn late March 2009, some four months after the 2008 Act had received royal assent, The Daily \nMail reported that:  \n \n[f]amily values were under attack again last night with the news that single women having IVF will be able \nto name anyone they like as their baby\u2019s father on the birth certificate.  New regulations mean that a mother \ncould nominate another woman to be her child\u2019s \u2018father\u2019.  The \u2018father\u2019 does not need to be genetically \nrelated to the baby, nor in any sort of romantic relationship with the mother.\n153\n \n \nA string of reports in other newspapers shows that the Mail was not alone in viewing as \u2018news\u2019, \nprovisions which had passed into law many months ago, a clear illustration of the lack of \nscrutiny of the status provisions during the reform process and consequent widespread lack of \nawareness of their content.\n154\n  Having discovered the provisions, the paper was able to produce a \nnumber of prominent critics to attack them as \u2018social engineering on the hoof\u2019,155 which ignored \nthe \u2018basic nature of a man and a woman bringing a child up together as parents\u2019156 and leading to \nthe \u2018falsification of birth certificates\u2019.157   These hostile comments mirror the criticisms which \nwere voiced during the limited discussion of the status provisions during the reform process \ndescribed above, which saw them described as \u2018a radical and dangerous new departure in family \nlaw\u2019,158 offering a \u2018lego-kit model of family life\u2019159 and equating children to \u2018commodities such \nas washing machines\u2019.160  Bewailing the new \u2018agreed fatherhood conditions\u2019, Lord Patten was \ndriven to complain that:  \n                                                 \n152\n The Department reported that they were actively considering how best to address the problems posed by \ntransgender parenthood.  They explained that: \u2018For the sake of the whole Bill reading strangely for a relatively small \nnumber of people, we thought we will stick with the one that sounds sensible to most people and then address the \nissues that arise from this difficult situation separately.\u2019 Skinner, interview on file.   \n \n153\n F.

The provocative title of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Callus\u2019s recent critique of \nthe provisions also clearly implies commodification concerns, drawing an analogy with what many have argued are \nspurious media-fuelled anxieties about the possibility of \u2018designer babies\u2019.  T. Callus, \u2018First \u201cDesigner Babies\u201d, Now \n30 \n \n \nThe Government are able to define the meaning of \u2018mother\u2019 \u2026 Yet flip over [the] page and off we go into a \nmagical mystery tour about what on earth the word \u2018father\u2019 might mean in different times and places, as a \nsign. This leads me to the conclusion that the Government, either by design or, as I suspect, by a muddled \nseries of accidents, have ended up attempting to deconstruct the meaning of fatherhood in the Bill, \ndivorcing male parenthood from biological reality as well as from practical and moral responsibilities.\n161\n \n \nIn this paper, we have provided a detailed analysis of what is innovative about the revisions \nmade to the status provisions.  The above critics are right in noting that, for the first time, two \nwomen can be named as a child\u2019s parents from the moment of birth though they neglect to \nmention that, since December 2005, same-sex partners have been able both to be registered as a \nchild\u2019s adoptive parents.162  Critics are also correct to highlight that potential parents may not \neven be in a sexual relationship, yet they might also recall that neither was this a statutory \nrequirement under the 1990 Act, which for unmarried couples required merely that a man receive \n\u2018treatment together\u2019 with a woman.163  And, while Lord Patten may be offended by the \ncontractual form of the provisions which have replaced the old \u2018treatment together\u2019 clause, to \nimply that there is anything new in divorcing male parenthood from \u2018biological reality\u2019 is clearly \nmistaken. As we noted above, such a separation was already clear in the 1990 Act and, indeed, in \nthe Family Law Reform Act 1987 which preceded it.  Indeed, there is a strong argument to be \nmade that the pater est principle has long prioritised the marital connection over the biological \none.\n164\n  Lord Patten\u2019s plea to remember the importance of \u2018biological reality\u2019 should also remind \nus of the contingency of what has been meant by the biological \u2018truth\u2019 in the context of \nmotherhood.   For women, the biological link has both gestational and genetic components yet, \nfor as long as it has been possible to separate these out, law has privileged the former over the \nlatter.     \n \nIn this light, it is interesting to note one final issue which preoccupied actors in the reform \nprocess: the perceived deception implicit in naming on a birth certificate someone other than a \nchild\u2019s biological parents.165  In her critique of the (then draft) parenthood provisions, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se \nCallus has written:   \n \nBy recognising the status of two female parents, the child\u2019s identity is thrown into disarray because the \nrecognition of two female parents conceals the necessary heterosexual element of human existence.  \n                                                                                                                                                             \n\u00c0 La Carte Parents\u2019 (2008) 38 Family Law 143.

Gavaghan \n\u2018Defending the Genetics Supermarket: the Law and Ethics of Selecting the Next Generation\u2019 (Abingdon: Routledge-\nCavendish, 2007) ch 1. \n \n161\nPer Lord Patten, HL Debs vol 697 col 30 (10 December 2007).   \n \n162\n Following the coming into effect of the Adoption and Children Act (2002). \n \n163\n s 28(3) 1990 Act. \n \n164\n See Bainham, n 78 above for a contrary view. \n \n165\n See generally for a critical discussion of what she describes (at 109) as the \u2018contemporary thirst for \u201ctruth\u201d\u2019, C. \nSmart, Personal Life: New Directions in Sociological Thinking (Cambridge: Polity, 2007), chapter 5.  For a rather \ndifferent view, see J. Eekelaar, Family Law and Personal Life (Oxford: OUP, 2006). \n \n31 \n \nAdmittedly, even the provisions [of the 1990 Act] on the use of donor gametes can lead to deception \ninsofar as the parents may conceal their use of donated gametes, but the proposals double that deception.\n166\n    \n \nThis mirrors Baroness Deech\u2019s plea to the House of Lords \u2018for the truth to be on birth certificates \n\u2013 or at least no obvious lie\u2019.167  Yet these interventions beg an interesting question: is the \npurported evil of deception lessened or increased in correlation with the likelihood of its \ndiscovery?  There is a strong counter-argument to be made to Callus that a child cannot long be \nsuccessfully deceived where there are two named female parents on the birth certificate and, \nthus, if we are really concerned about lying to children, we should be far more worried about \npermitting a man other than the genetic father to be so named.\n168\n  Those accounts which argue \nthat birth certificates should be a record of \u2018true biological fact\u2019 also need to grapple with a \nfurther problem: in some instances, this would require us to name more than two parents.   \n \nThis paper has attempted to tease out and render explicit the assumptions underpinning Part 2 of \nthe 2008 Act.  Our aim has not been to criticise the law for its lack of internal coherence:  we \nmake no assumption as to whether such coherence is achievable or, indeed, desirable.  The \ntensions and contradictions reflected in the above discussion are just as readily apparent in the \nway that ordinary people talk about parenting, as is well illustrated in recent interviews \nconducted with men regarding their visions of fatherhood and lesbian women regarding \nmotherhood.\n169\n   The above analysis does, however, lead us to question the role played by the \nideal of the \u2018sexual family\u2019 in limiting the options considered in this reform process and whether \n\u2013 and for how long \u2013 it can be maintained in the face of the pressures upon it which we have \nsketched above.   \n \nNeither have we attempted any sustained normative analysis of the assumptions that we have \nhighlighted as significant in underpinning the 2008 Act.  However, while we have provided no \nargument to say that they are misplaced, we would go so far as to suggest that they would have \nbenefited from less reliance on intuition and more sustained analysis so that the assumptions \nbehind our legislation are made subject to critical scrutiny, transparent debate and explicit \nchoice.  As was seen above, while the status provisions reflect a series of commitments about the \nappropriate shape of the family, they were subject to very little attention from Parliament, the \npublic or the media.  The complexity of these provisions may have encouraged a view that they \n                                                 \n166\n Above, n 160. \n \n167\n HL Debs vol 697 col 293 (12 Dec 2007). \n \n168\n And this is surely a major part of the reason why lesbian parents are known to be so much more honest with their \nchildren regarding the circumstances of their conception.

This lack of scrutiny may well have contributed to a failure to identify and attempt to \nremedy problems for the future.  For example, we have noted the failure to tease out some of the \ncomplexities relating to transgender parenting and have suggested that the way in which the \nrecognition of lesbian parents has been framed, closely paralleling the treatment of heterosexual \nparents, is not necessarily well designed to fit the specificities of same sex families.  Specifically, \nwe described the lack of rights accorded to a woman who contributes an egg to create a child \nwith her partner, who will be the gestational (and therefore legal) mother.  More generally, it is \nlikely that English law will be forced to address the question of whether to recognise more than \ntwo legal parents at some point in the future.  As we noted above, however, the Department of \nHealth was quite clear in its view that it was not the right body to oversee any wide ranging \nchanges to family law: if such sustained analysis of the law regulating parenthood is to occur, it \nmust happen elsewhere.\n170\n  While this reluctance is understandable, the lack of such analysis \nmeant that earlier provisions which have become increasingly out of step with other aspects of \nfamily law over time were left intact and that new measures were developed at least in part in \nreliance on common sense assumptions rather than detailed analysis and sustained consideration. \n \nIt has been argued elsewhere that the vision of the family underpinning the 1990 Act was already \nan anachronism at the time that it was passed.\n171\n  The gulf between the sexual family ideal and \nshifting patterns of parenting were readily apparent to the judiciary in 1990, with contemporary \njudges routinely making complex determinations designed to protect children\u2019s relationships \nwith a range of adults, rather than seeking mechanically to impose the template of the nuclear \nfamily model onto social realities which did not obviously fit easily within it.  The inherent \ntraditionalism of the 1990 Act was at least in part explicable through anxieties regarding the \npossibilities offered by reproductive technologies, resulting in a \u2018conservative impulse\u2019 to \ncontain them.\n172\n  Some of the reforms effected by the 2008 Act might therefore seem to reflect a \ncoming of age of reproductive technologies and a more relaxed attitude to their regulation.\n173\n  On \nthe other hand, we have here tracked the extent to which the more radical possibilities offered by \nassisted reproductive technologies were shelved or left unconsidered.  We suggested that while \n                                                 \n170\n It is far from clear which arm of government would be best placed to carry out this work: over and above the \nclear implications for families, the question of who should be named on a birth certificate is also of central concern \nto the Home Office, the Office for National Statistics and the Department of Work and Pensions. \n \n171\n Sheldon, n 60 above. \n \n172\n J.

Ragon\u00e9 (eds), Reproducing Reproduction: Kinship, Power and Technological Innovation (Philadelphia: \nUniversity of Pennsylvania Press, 1998). \n \n173\n e.g. the reform of s 13(5) and, whatever limitations we have noted to these provisions, the very possibility of \nrecognising a second female parent.  It is also noteworthy that the question of whether single women should be \neligible to receive treatment, a matter of extreme controversy when the 1990 Act was passed, appears no longer to \nbe at issue.  \n \n33 \n \nthe two-parent model has outlived its moorings in the heterosexual couple, that this model has \ncontinued to frame understandings of parenthood and lies at the root of some interesting tensions \nin this reform process, underpinning the refusals to admit the possibility that a child can have \ntwo \u2018fathers\u2019 or two \u2018mothers\u2019, that a child can have three legal parents or that motherhood can \nbe grounded in anything other than gestation.  And, indeed, the very fact that reproductive \ntechnologies remain regulated by primary legislation, only to be offered under licence, may \nsignal an ongoing suspicion both of the technologies and of those who seek to use them.\n174\n  \n \nIn practice, only a tiny minority of individuals will ever gain parenthood by virtue of the legal \nprinciples which form the focus of this paper.\n175\n  Yet we would suggest that these provisions are \nnonetheless of very significant interest.  In this reform process, while the reformers tended to \nrely on a combination of common sense intuitions regarding who should count as family and a \ngeneral desire to achieve \u2018equality\u2019, we can nonetheless trace a complex and ongoing \nrenegotiation of the boundaries of law\u2019s understanding of family, with the end result being to \nencompass a broader range of familial arrangements and, most notably, to further recognition of \nfamilies headed by a lesbian couple.  How the more radical potential of the 2008 Act to open up \nparenthood more visibly to non-partners under the agreed fatherhood and female parenthood \nprovisions will reconfigure our understandings of family remains to be seen, with much \ndepending on how clinics understand the provisions and their willingness to accept that non-\npartners are eligible for treatment.\n176\n  It would seem that relocating the boundaries of family will \ninevitably result in a new series of exclusions,\n177\n which will provoke their own controversies in \nyears to come, inevitably again falling to be renegotiated as our ideas of family shift further.  As \nPhil Willis MP, the Chair of the Joint Committee put it: \n \nSince 1990, we have had a recognition of non-nuclear families, the like of which I wouldn\u2019t have believed \npossible.  You know ... like many of the creatures over here [in the House of Commons] ... [I was] brought \nup in the generations that recognise the nuclear family as the norm and everything else as abnormal or \nslightly abnormal.  And yet, legislation, you know, has really changed all those definitions.  And the idea \nthat families in the future will not again morph in different directions... I think it\u2019s fanciful to think that that \nis not going to happen, because I think it is.  I think you mentioned about more than two parents \u2013 I think \nthat may well become the reality.  You know, you have a number of people who actually are the family of \nan individual child or children.  Now, what do you do about that?\n178\n \n                                                 \n174\n As Webb informed us, whether procedures such as IVF should be legally registered was one of the first things to \nbe considered by the Department of Health in this process, the conclusion being that \u2018there was still need for it.\u2019  \nInterview on file. \n \n175\n Indeed, as we noted above, only a small minority of those who make use of assisted conception are caught by \nthese provisions.  \n \n176\n We thank Emily Jackson for this important point.  As we noted above, the steer provided to clinicians in the \nHFEA\u2019s Code of Practice is potentially misleading, in implying that all second parents will be partners.  Above, n \n67. \n \n177\n As Callus puts it, in her critique of the new provisions, \u2018Justified on the premise of equality, the proposals in fact \ngive rise to further inequalities\u2019 (n 160 above at 146). \n \n178\n Willis, interview on file. \n"}
