This problem is encountered by, for example:\n\u000f security guards patrolling a museum or art gallery;\n\u000f antiterrorist o\u00a2 cers patrolling an airport or shopping mall;\n\u000f police forces patrolling a city containing a number of potential targets for theft such as\njewelry stores;\n\u000f soldiers patrolling an occupied city or territory;\n\u000f air marshals patrolling an airline network;\n\u000f inspectors patrolling a container yard or cargo warehouse.\nSuch problems have been studied in diverse literatures. For example, a well-known problem\nin computational geometry deals with the position of security guards in art galleries (Urrutia,\n2000) and a classical Operations Research literature exists on the scheduling of police patrols\n(see e.g. Larson (1972) and references therein). The importance of randomized patrols has\nbeen recognized in law enforcement for some time, but not the nature of the randomization\n(e.g. Sherman and Eck (2002, p. 297)). Much of the optimization literature on this subject\n(e.g. Chelst, 1978) concentrates on the important problem of how to deploy randomized patrols\nto maximize the probability of intercepting a crime in progress, when the crime frequency of\ndi\u00a4erent locations is taken as given (often a realistic assumption, at least in the short term).\nSuch models however are not game theoretic and do not capture the idea of a patrolling schedule\nas a strategy selected in the face of an intelligent and malign adversary, for example an art thief or\nterrorist, which is a distinctive feature of the class of models we study in this paper. Although\nthere do exist di\u00a4erential game formulations of the relationship between police and criminal\n(Isaacs, 1999, Feichtinger, 1983) these tend to focus on a dynamic (and often strategic) process\nof mutual adjustment rather than confronting the problem confronted by the scheduler who sits\ndown to determine the path which the patrol will take.\nGame theoretic analyses have recently featured prominently in OR studies of homeland\nsecurity and counterterrorism (e.g. Brown et al., 2006, Bier and Azaiez, 2009, Lindelauf et\n2\nal., 2009). An attractive and unique feature of game theoretic formulations in the context of\npatrolling is that they provide insight into how a Patroller should randomize her patrols. There\nis a clear common-sense rationale for randomization: a predictable Patroller is an ine\u00a4ective one.\nYet a naive \"maximum entropy\" heuristic (Fox et al, 2005) may be not fare well: faced with\nn targets it may not make sense to spend 1=n of the available patrolling time with each of\nthem. This dilemma has attracted considerable attention recently amongst practitioners and\nthe research community has responded to this challenge: in particular, the work of Paruchuri\nand colleagues (2007) provides a number of heuristic models which illustrate how equilibrium\nrandomized strategies can be approximated when the problem is formulated as a Stackelberg\n(leader-follower) game, and such models have found use in real security situations (Gordon,\n2007; Newsweek, 2007).\nOur work on this problem is inspired by the theory of search games, on which an extensive\nmathematical literature has developed over the last few decades. This theory captures situations\nin which a Searcher aims to minimize the time taken to \u0085nd a stationary or mobile Hider, who\ndoes not want to be found, on a network or in a region (Alpern and Gal, 2003). A variant on the\nthe search game is the Accumulation game (Ruckle, 2001; Kikuta and Ruckle, 2001) where the\nHider distributes some sort of continuous material over n locations, and the Searcher searches r\nlocations and con\u0085scates any material hidden there; if the amount of material remaining exceeds\na certain critical level, the Hider wins, otherwise he loses. There are also related literatures on\nInspection games (Avenhaus, von Stengel and Zamir, 2002), in which an Inspector who seeks\nto catch an Inspectee red-handed, and In\u0085ltration games (Auger, 1991; Garnaev, Garnaeva and\nGoutal, 1996; Garnaev, 2000, and Alpern, 1992) in which a Guard seeks to prevent an In\u0085ltrator\nfrom penetrating some sensitive facility. Similar attack\/ defence games have been studied in\nmilitary operations research (Washburn, 2003), dating as far back as Morse and Kimball (1950).\nMany such games are of independent mathematical interest and have been studied in a purely\nmathematical settings (e.g. Baston, Bostock and Ferguson, 1989; Zoroa, Zoroa and Ruiz, 1988).\nVarious results are available for how the Searcher\/ Inspector\/ Guard\/ Defender should proceed,\ndepending on the assumptions about the structure of the mathematical space which she inhabits.\nA particularly productive line of research in the search game literature has been to explore the\ncase where the search space can be thought of as a network or graph, as we do here.\nIn this paper we formulate a game which we call the Patrolling Game. Unlike the work of\nParuchuri and colleagues, our problem is a zero-sum game, and provides for a defender who is\n3\nmobile, being able to travel between locations in the course of her shift (a \"Patroller\"). Unlike\nsearch games, our \"Attacker\" (the equivalent of the search game \"Hider\") may commence his\nattack at any time and has to be detected within a given time-window in order to forestall\nthe performance of some misdeed. Like the Accumulation game, and unlike the standard search\ngame, our game is win-lose - a game of type rather than degree in the terminology of Isaacs (1999).\nOur problem is su\u00a2 ciently idealized that it is possible to obtain insightful analytic results, but\nsu\u00a2 ciently realistic that it is recognizable as a practical problem faced by practitioners in various\ndomains.\nWe present some analytic results for this game, and demonstrate that it yields patrolling\n(and attacking) strategies which are natural and intuitive. We are in this paper unable to\npresent general analytic results for all games of this type, and it seems unlikely that closed form\nexpressions exist for the value and optimal mixtures. Indeed, even computing optimal strategies\nmay be quite challenging in many cases, because of the combinatorial explosion in the Patroller\u0092s\nstrategy space.\nThis paper is organized as follows. We present in Section 2 a rigorous formulation of\npatrolling games, together with some elementary observations on properties of the Value. As\nthe number of pure strategies for the players can be very large, we give in Section 3 three\nmethods for reducing the number that we have to consider: symmetrization, dominance and\ndecomposition. Section 4 discusses certain classes of strategies that the players can use on any\ngraph, and which are optimal on certain classes of graphs. Section 5 gives either the Value, or\nbounds on the Value, for patrolling games on certain classes of graphs: Hamiltonian, bipartite\nand line graphs. Section 6 presents extensions of the model and concludes.\n2 The Patrolling Game\n2.1 Formulation\nThe Patrolling Game G = G (Q;T;m) is a win-lose (and hence zero-sum) game between a\nmaximizing Patroller (female) and a minimizing Attacker (male). It comes in two forms, the\none-o\u00a4 game Go = Go (Q;T;m) and the periodic game Gp = Gp (Q;T;m) : The one-o\u00a4 game is\nplayed out over a given time interval T = f0; 1; 2; : : : ; T \u0000 1g of length T on a graph Q with n\nnodes N and edges E . We will assume that Q is connected unless stated otherwise, and we say\ntwo nodes are \"adjacent\" if they are linked by an edge. A pure strategy for the Attacker is a\n4\npair [i; I] ; where i 2 N is called the attack node and I = f\u001c ; \u001c + 1; : : : ; \u001c +m\u0000 1g \u0012 T is an\nm-interval called the attack interval. A pure strategy for the Patroller is a walk w : T !Q called\na patrol. If i 2 w (I) we say that the patrol intercepts the attack, in which case the Patroller\nwins and the payo\u00a4 is P = 1; otherwise the Attacker wins and we have P = 0: Thus the payo\u00a4\nis given by\nP (w; [i; I]) =\n8><>: 1 (Patroller wins); if i 2 w (I) (attack is intercepted);0 (Attacker wins); if i =2 w (I) (attack is completed uninterrupted);\nThe Value V o of this game Go is thus the probability that the attack is successfully intercepted.\nExcept in trivial cases, optimal strategies must be mixed.\nThe periodic game is played on the time circle T \u0003 = f0; 1; 2; : : : ; T \u0000 1g of length T on a\ngraph Q with n nodes N and edges E; the asterisk denotes that arithmetic using the indices of\ntime circle takes place modulo T . As in the one-o\u00a4 game, a pure strategy for the Attacker is a\npair [i; I] ; where i 2 N is the attack node and I \u001a T \u0003 is the attack interval but attack intervals\nare now m-intervals in the time circle, so for example if T is 24 and m is 5; the attack could be\ncarried out overnight, during the interval f22; 23; 0; 1; 2g (10 o\u0092clock to 2 in the morning). The\npatrols (Patroller pure strategies) are now walks of period T (w : T \u0003 ! N ) but must \"join up\"\nin the sense that they satisfy (w (T \u0000 1) ; w(0)) 2 E (no such restriction applies in the one-o\u00a4\ngame).\nThe periodic game is simpler to analyze because the attack can be assumed to take place\nequiprobably in any time interval, which simpli\u0085es the analysis (see Subsection 3.1). When\nthe values of the games di\u00a4er, we will use the superscripts V p and V o to distinguish between\nthe Values, using V when the result applies to both cases. V (V p, V o) can be considered as\nparameterized byQ, T , andm just as G is, but most of the time writing V (Q;T;m) is distracting\nand confusing and we will tend to suppress some or all of these arguments. We denote by d(i; i0)\nthe distance function on the node set N , the minimum number of edges between i and i0 2 N :\nThis formulation makes a number of assumptions which are not in fact as restrictive as they\nmight appear. The \u0085rst is the assumption an attack will take place. An immediate response\nto this is that even though attacks occur very rarely, one should patrol on the assumption that\nan attack will happen - otherwise what is the point of patrolling at all? A more sophisticated\nresponse is that the parties are really engaged in a non-zero sum deterrence game and the\nPatroller only has to reduce the probability of attack to a level where the expected value of\n5\nthe attack is less than the value to the Attacker of engaging in an attack elsewhere (another\nairport, another art museum). As it turns out, however, the game studied in this paper can be\nseen as being embedded in a larger non-zero sum deterrence game in the manner of Avenhaus,\nvon Stengel and Zamir (2002). In this case the key to the analysis of the larger non-zero\nsum game is precisely the analysis of the game discussed in the current paper. The second\nand third assumptions are that the node values are equal (all paintings are worth the same\namount of money; the damage in\u0087icted by an attack at some airport terminal will be the same\nas at any other airport terminal), and that the distances between nodes are equal, respectively.\nObviously this may well not hold in an application setting. It is not hard to modify the\nmodelling framework to include these features. However, beyond rather simple results of the\nsort proved in this section, it is di\u00a2 cult to obtain analytic results for games which incorporate\nthese complexities.\n2.2 General Properties of the Value V\nWe now make some observations about the Value V , which apply to both one-o\u00a4 and periodic\nversions of the game. We start with a monotonicity result (Lemma 1), the last part of which\ninvolves the notion of identifying nodes of a graph. If a graph Q0 can be created by successively\n\"merging\" pairs (or tuples) of nodes in Q such that the new, merged node in Q0 inherits edges\nfrom its constituent nodes in Q (i.e. if i and i0 in Q are merged to become j in Q0, the nodes\nadjacent to j are precisely those adjacent to either i or i0) we say that Q0 can be obtained from\nQ by node identi\u0085cation (Bondy and Murty, 2007). Formally this identi\u0085cation operation can\nbe de\u0085ned by a projection map \u0019 : N ! N 0; where N 0 is the node set of the new graph Q0;\nand \u0019\u00001 (j) represents a set of nodes of Q that have been identi\u0085ed. For example, we can easily\nobtain the line graph with n nodes Ln by vertically identifying nodes of the cycle with 2 (n\u0000 1)\nnodes C2(n\u00001) (see Figure 1 for the case n = 5).\nFigure 1. L5 as a projection of C8:\nLemma 1\n1. V (Q;T;m) is nondecreasing in m:\n6\n2. V (Q;T;m) cannot decrease if an additional edge is added between two nonadjacent nodes\nof the graphQ. That is, V is nondecreasing in E (with the ordering on the latter understood\nin the sense of set inclusion).\n3. V p (Q;T;m) \u0014 V o (Q;T;m)\n4. If Q0 is obtained from Q by node identi\u0085cation, V (Q0) \u0015 V (Q) :\nProof. The \u0085rst part follows from the observation that a patrol that intercepts an attack [i; I]\nalso intercepts [i; I 0] if I 0 \u001b I: The next two are based on the fact that in a zero sum game\na player cannot do worse if he gets additional strategies. The last is based on the following\nobservation: If a patrol w intercepts an attack on a node i of Q then the patrol \u0019 (w) intercepts\nthe associated attack on the node \u0019 (i) of Q0: So the Patroller can ensure that the expected\npayo\u00a4 is at least V (Q) by choosing patrols w for Q according to some optimal mixed strategy,\nand then playing the projected patrol \u0019 (w) :\nThe next result gives easy general bound on the Value.\nLemma 2 1n \u0014 V \u0014 mn , for V equal to V p or V o and any parameters Q, T and m. More\ngenerally, V \u0014 !=n; where ! is the maximum number of nodes that any patrol can cover (!\ndepends on whether the one-o\u00a4 or periodic version is being played).\nProof. The Patroller can obtain the left inequality by randomly picking a node and waiting\nthere. The Attacker can obtain the right inequality by attacking a random node during some\n\u0085xed time interval I. Of these n pure strategies, the Patroller can intercept at most jw (I) j \u0014\njIj = m of them, giving the bound m=n; or more generally the bound !=n; since jw (I) j \u0014 ! by\nde\u0085nition.\nIt is worth observing that ! is bounded above by the node size of the largest component of\nQ (if it is not connected), with !=n equalling 1=n for the completely disconnected graph. Also\nnote that for the one-o\u00a4 game with m = 1; where Q is the complete graph Kn; this is a special\ncase of Ruckle\u0092s \"Simple Search Game\" (Ruckle, 1983). Since we thus have (from Part 2 of\nLemma 1) V = 1=n whenever m = 1; we will assume for the remainder of the paper that m \u0015 2.\nIn real life, the authority responsible for Patrolling may have a decision to make about shift\nlength involving weighing e\u00a4ectiveness against some cost criterion (and cost may be convex and\nincreasing in shift length because of a requirement to pay overtime at a higher rate). What can\n7\nwe say about the impact of shift length on interception probability, i.e. the shape of V (T ), in\norder to help the authority make this sort of decision?\nProposition 3 1. V o(T + 1) \u0014 V o(T )\n2. V p(kT ) \u0015 V p(T ) 8k = 1; :::;1\nProof. The \u0085rst result holds because the Attacker pure strategy set for Go(T + 1) contains his\npure strategy set in Go(T ): note that the Patroller strategy sets are the same, with an irrelevant\ntruncation of w(T + 1) in Go(T ): For the second result, note that the Patroller can ensure a\nwinning probability of V p(T ) in the game Gp(kT ) by picking a T -periodic walk according to an\noptimal strategy in Gp(T ) and repeating it k times; but as there may be strategies available in\nGp(kT ) which have no analogues in Gp(T ) the value may be strictly higher.\nThus in the one-o\u00a4 game, increasing the time T helps the Attacker, by giving him more\nchoices of when to attack. The situation in the periodic game is more complicated. Increasing\nT by a multiplicative factor always helps the Patroller. However for some graphs V p(T +1) may\nbe less than V p(T ), so a larger T is not always better for the Patroller in the periodic game.\nAn example where increasing T may hurt the Patroller is discussed in Section 5 and depicted in\nFigure 7.\nAn interesting implication of Proposition 3 and Lemma 1 part 3 is that the gap between the\none-o\u00a4 and periodic game decreases as T is multiplied:\nCorollary 4 0 \u0014 V o(kT )\u0000 V p(kT ) \u0014 V o(T )\u0000 V p(T ) 8k = 1; :::;1\nNote that it is not the case that V p(\u0001) is nondecreasing in T : for example, for the periodic\ngame on the n-cycle, Cn, V p(T = n + 1) is strictly less than V p(T = n) for m \u0015 2 because\nthe Patroller has to \"waste\" a time period by remaining at some node in order to return to\nher starting point. In Section 5.1, we show that for the games on certain sorts of graphs (e.g.\nHamiltonian) the maximum value of the periodic game is obtained with a certain periodicity\nwhich is a function of n. Note also that both inequalities can be strict - for example in Section\n3.3 we analyze Go(L6; 5; 3) and show it has value 3\/8; however, by choosing 123 and 456 with\nequal probability, the Patroller can obtain 1\/2 in Go(L6; 3; 3).\n8\n3 Strategy Reduction Techniques\nEven for small graphs, the number of pure strategies available to the players can be quite\nlarge. So for practical purposes, as well as in proofs, it is useful to have methods for reducing\nthe number of strategies that must be considered. This section discusses three such methods:\nsymmetrization, dominance and decomposition.\n3.1 Symmetrization\nSymmetry considerations can simplify both the placement and timing of attacks and patrols.\nFirst we consider the placement of attacks in terms of the spatial symmetry of Q: As an example,\nnote that the nodes 2 and 3 are symmetrically placed in the Kite Graph KT of Figure 2. So it\nfollows from well-known arguments (Alpern and Asic, 1985; Zoroa and Zoroa, 1993) that there\nis an optimal mixed Attacker strategy with the property that, for any attack interval I, these\ntwo nodes are attacked with equal probability.\n4\n3\n2\n51\nFigure 2. Kite Graph KT\nThis idea can be formalized by considering the automorphisms of Q; that is, the adjacency-\npreserving bijections of Q: (For the kite graph there are only the identity automorphism and the\nre\u0087ection about the vertical axis.) Calling nodes equivalent if some automorphism \u001b of Q takes\none into the other, we need consider only attacks equiprobably distributed over the equivalence\nclass of nodes. Similarly, two patrols w1 and w2 are equivalent if w2 (t) = \u001bw1 (t) for some\nautomorphism \u001b, and we can restrict our attention to the equiprobable mixture of such patrols.\nA similar line of reasoning applies to time. In the periodic game all attack intervals are\nequivalent under some rotation of the time circle, so we need only consider the attack node. In\nthe one-o\u00a4 game, attack intervals I1 and I2 are equivalent if \r (I1) = I2 where \r is the re\u0087ection\nautomorphism of the time interval T = f0; : : : ; T \u0000 1g de\u0085ned by \r (t) = T \u0000 t:\nThe fact that we need only consider symmetrical strategies, that is, mixed strategies which\ngive equal probability to equivalent strategies, is demonstrated in Alpern and Asic (1985), and\n9\nZoroa and Zoroa (1993). Given a game G we call the modi\u0085cation of G where we restrict\nattention to Attacker and Patroller strategies which are equiprobable mixtures over the equiv-\nalence classes de\u0085ned by the space and time automorphisms, the symmetrization of G; this\nsymmetrized game has the same value as the original G, but has fewer strategies and so is easier\nto study.\n3.2 Dominance\nSince the Patrolling Game is a win-lose game, we can use the following weak notion of dominance.\nWe say a pure strategy s1 dominates a pure strategy s2 of the same player if it wins against every\nopponent strategy that s2 wins against, and against at least one more. The Value is unchanged\nif we successively eliminate dominated strategies.\nAs an example of how successive elimination of dominated strategies can be used, consider\nagain the kite graph KT of Figure 2. Node 4 is what we call a penultimate node, that is, a\nnon-leaf node that is adjacent to a leaf node (node 5 in KT ): Our next result shows that there\nis an optimal strategy on KT which does not involve any attacks on a penultimate node.\nLemma 5 Assume Q is connected and T \u0015 3: For m \u0015 2, patrols that stay on any node\nfor three consecutive periods are dominated. For m \u0015 3; attacks on penultimate nodes are\ndominated, and consequently the Attacker has an optimal strategy concentrated on nodes which\nare not penultimate.\nProof. The proof is by iterated dominance. Suppose the patrol w1 is at the same node i for\nthe three consecutive periods I = ft\u0000 1; t; t+ 1g. De\u0085ne w2 to be the same as w1 except that\nw2 (t) = i\n0; where i0 is adjacent to i: For m \u0015 2; the patrol w2 intercepts every attack that w1\nintercepts, as well as the attack on i0 during I; and hence dominates w1: So we can now assume\nthat at equilibrium the Patroller does not use patrols which stay at a node for three consecutive\nperiods. Next suppose that i0 is a penultimate node adjacent to a leaf node i: We now show\nthat any attack on node i0 during an m\u0000interval I is dominated by an attack on i during I: If\nw wins against the attack [i; I] ; then w (t) = i; for some t 2 I: If m \u0015 3, then I contains at least\nthree consecutive periods, therefore, therefore one of the sets ft \u0000 2; t \u0000 1; tg, ft \u0000 1; t; t + 1g,\nft; t + 1; t + 2g is contained in I. Let t0 and t00 be the two of these periods di\u00a4erent from t\nand contained in I. By the earlier argument, we know that either w(t0) or w(t00) is i0 and so\ni0 2 w (I) ; and w wins against [i0; I] : Hence attacking at node i0 is a dominated strategy.\n10\n3.3 Decomposition\nSometimes we can think of a graph Q as being made up of simpler graphs Q1 and Q2: We call\nthis a decomposition of Q. The nodes of the original graph Q are the union of the nodes Q1\nand Q2: All nodes which are adjacent in Q are also adjacent in any Qi which contains both\nof them. See Figure 3 for an illustration. Q can of course be decomposed into multiple Qi\nthrough repeated decomposition. If the nodes of Q1 and Q2 are disjoint and Q has no edges\nbetween nodes in distinct Qi; then we say it is a disjoint decomposition.\nQ Q1\nQ2\nFigure 3. Decomposition of a graph\nLemma 6 Let V = V (Q;T;m) and Vk = V (Qk; T;m) : If the graphs Qk; k = 1; : : : ;K; form\na decomposition of Q; then\nV \u0015 1PK\nk=1 1=Vk\n;\nwith equality in the case of a disjoint decomposition.\nProof. Suppose the Patroller restricts herself to a family of mixed strategies Sk; where Sk is an\noptimal mixed strategy for the game G (Qk; T;m) : Suppose she picks Sk with a probability qk\nsuch that qkVk = c is constant. In this case we have\n1 =\nKX\nk=1\nqk = c\nKX\nk=1\n1=Vk; or c = 1=\nKX\nk=1\n1=Vk:\nFor any attack pair [i; I] ; the node i belongs to the node set of some graph Qk. So with\nprobability qk the Patroller will be optimally patrolling Qk and in this case will intercept the\nAttacker with probability at least Vk: Hence the Patroller wins with probability at least qkVk = c:\nHence the value of the game on graph Q is at least c; as claimed. If the Patroller is only allowed\nto patrol nodes from a single graph Qk; the best she can do is win with probability c, so it\nfollows that if the graphs Qk have disjoint node sets and are disconnected, then V = c:\n11\n3.4 Examples\nIn this subsection, we deal with two examples which illustrate the use of the tools discussed\npreviously in this section, and also demonstrate the some of the subtleties of this class of game.\nOur \u0085rst example shows that, in the one-o\u00a4 game, it may be the case that the Attacker\u0092s optimal\nstrategy may involve a time-varying strategy; our second example shows how our tools can be\nused to tackle an apparently quite complex game.\nFor our \u0085rst example, to illustrate the ideas of symmetry and dominance, we now analyze\nthe line graph L6 with nodes i = 1; : : : ; 6; for the case T = 5 and m = 3: The product of\nL6 (drawn vertically) and the time space T = f1; : : : ; 5g (drawn horizontally) is shown three\ntimes in Figure 3. An attack with probability p at node i and time interval ft\u0000 1; t; t+ 1g is\nrepresented by a p at the middle of the attack interval (i; t). Since there are three possible attack\nintervals (f1; 2; 3g ; f2; 3; 4g ; f3; 4; 5g) there are 6\u0002 3 = 18 possible attacks.\nWe \u0085rst consider the one-o\u00a4 game Go (L6; 5; 3) in a restricted form where the Attacker must\nuse a time-invariant strategy. This is illustrated in the left drawing of Figure 4, where there are\nno attacks at penultimate nodes (f2; 5g) (using Lemma 5). Since nodes 1 and 6; and nodes 3\nand 4 are equivalent under symmetry, we can assume they are attacked with equal probability.\nHence this symmetric and time-invariant strategy is entirely characterized by two numbers, x\nand y, and (by the law of total probability) 6x+6y = 1: The patrol w1 = (3; 2; 1; 2; 3) intercepts\nall attacks at node 1 and two attacks at node 3, so wins with probability 3x + 2y; similarly\nw2 = (1; 2; 3; 4; any) intercepts one attack at node 1 and \u0085ve attacks at nodes 3 and 4, and\nwins with probability x + 5y: These two patrols together dominate all others. So the Attacker\nminimaxes when 3x + 2y = x + 5y: This occurs when x = 1=10 and y = 1=15; with minimax\nvalue V \u0003 = 13=30. (An easy calculation then shows that the Patroller should adopt w1 and w2\nwith probabilities 4=5 and 1=5:)\ni\\t\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n1        2          3         4         5\nxxx\ny\nx x x\ny\ny\nyy\ny\n1\/8\n1\/8\n1\/8\n1\/8 1\/81\/8\n1\/8 1\/8\n12\nFigure 4. Optimal attacking and patrolling strategies for Go(L6) with T = 5 and m = 3\nIn the (unrestricted) game Go (L6; 5; 3) it is harder to derive the equilibrium strategy pair,\nbut it is fairly easy to demonstrate that the Value is V o = 3=8 = 0:375 ; which shows that no\ntime-invariant mixed Attacker strategy can be optimal. To see that V o \u0014 3=8, consider the\nAttacker strategy shown in the middle drawing, and observe that no patrol can intercept more\nthan three of the eight equiprobable attacks. For a lower bound, suppose the Patroller adopts\nthe four strategies (2; 1; 2; 3; 4) ; (2; 3; 4; 5; 6) and their re\u0087ections (5; 6; 5; 4; 3) ; (5; 4; 3; 2; 1) with\nprobability 1=8 each; and adopts the two equivalent strategies (3; 2; 1; 2; 3) and (4; 5; 6; 5; 4) with\nprobability 1=4 each. The walks adopted with probability 1=8 are shown in the right panel of\nFigure 4 by thin diagonal lines and those in adopted with probability 1=4 by thick lines. Attacks\nare shown by heavy dots at the center of the attack interval. The assertion V o \u0015 3=8 follows\nfrom the observation that any possible attack is intercepted by at least three of the patrols,\ncounting the thick lines as two (i.e. the total probability mass associated with all the walks\npassing through, immediately to the right of, and immediately to the left of every dot is at least\n3=8). It is also interesting to observe that all ten attacks which are not used at all in the middle\ndrawing are intercepted by more than three of these patrols. Thus, the Value of the one-o\u00a4\ngame Go (L6; 5; 3) is 3=8; but securing this value requires the use of time-dependent Attacker\nstrategies: the middle node is only to be attacked in the middle time interval f3; 4; 5g :\nNext we analyze the periodic version, the game Gp (L6; 5; 3) : This is similar to the restricted\nversion of the one-o\u00a4 game discussed above, except that the middle of the attack can be at any\ntime, so comparing with the left drawing of Figure 4, the x\u0092s and y\u0092s would extend throughout\nthe rows, and so we have 10x + 10y = 1. We need only consider four patrols (together with\ntheir symmetric translations): w1 = (1; 2; 1; 2; 1); w2 = (1; 2; 3; 2; 1); w3 = (1; 2; 3; 3; 2) and\nw4 = (3; 4; 3; 4; 3): the others are either dominated (because they spend time needlessly at\na penultimate node which will never be attacked at equilibrium) or are duplicates. If the\nAttacker attacks at an end node (with probability 10x), these four strategies will intercept 5, 4,\n3, and 0 attacks respectively; if the Attacker attacks at a central node (with probability 10y)\nthey intercept 0, 3, 4 and 10 attacks respectively. As this game e\u00a4ectively has two Attacker\nstrategies it can be easily solved graphically: the optimal strategy involves the Attacker choosing\nattacks with probability x = 7110 , y =\n4\n110 and the Patroller mixing between w2 and w4 and their\nsymmetric translations with probability 1011 and\n1\n11 respectively. The value V\np of the game is\n4=11:\n13\nObserve that the conditional probability of an attack being intercepted given that the Pa-\ntroller plays the equilibrium mixture of w2 and w4is 4\/11, 5\/11, 4\/11,4\/11, 5\/11, 4\/11 for attacks\nat a random time at nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 respectively. Thus the penultimate nodes (2 and 5)\nshould not be attacked, as the interception probabilities are higher by 1\/11. This reinforces and\n(hopefully) makes intuitive the iterated dominance line of reasoning: loosely speaking, when the\nPatroller ensures that attacks at 4 and 6 are intercepted with probability 4\/11, the intermediate\nnode 5 automatically gets covered enough to have an even higher interception probability.\nTo summarize, for line graph L6, with T = 5 and m = 3; we have\nV p =\n4\n11\n< V o =\n3\n8\n< V \u0003 =\n13\n30\nThus the Patroller does better in the one-o\u00a4 game, and thus the bound stated in Lemma 1 Part\n3 need not be tight. Further, in this instance, the Attacker has to adopt a time-dependent\nstrategy in order to bene\u0085t fully.\nFor our second example, to demonstrate the use of all of our strategy reduction techniques,\nwe analyze the periodic game for the kite graph illustrated in Figure 2 with T = m = 3. The\ndominance argument of Lemma 3 showed that, at equilibrium, the Attacker would never attack\nnode 4, as it is always better for him to attack the adjacent leaf node 5. Moreover, in the\nperiodic case for T = 3, there is no feasible Patroller strategy which visits both node 5 and any\none of 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, if we remove node 4, the game on the resulting graph KT 0 has the\nsame Value as the game on KT:\nQ1\nQ2\n3\n2\n5\n1\nFigure 5. Decomposition of Kite graph KT into KT 0\nLemma 6 shows that for Q1 and Q2 as in Figure 5, we have\nV p\n\u0000\nKT 0\n\u0001\n=\n1\n1=V p (Q1) + 1=V p (Q2)\n(1)\n14\nObviously V p (Q2) = 1, and it can be easily shown that V p (L3) = 1=2 for T = m = 3 (observe\nthat as attacks adjacent to the a leaf node are dominated, the Attacker has two strategies, to\nattack at nodes 2 and 3, which are re\u0087ections of each other and so are played equiprobably; no\nfeasible Patroller strategy can intercept both). Hence by (1) we have\nV p (KT ) = V p\n\u0000\nKT 0\n\u0001\n=\n1\n1 + 2\n=\n1\n3\n:\nThis is another example where the Patroller does strictly better in the one-o\u00a4 game, in which\nV o = 3=5: To see this, \u0085rst note that by Lemma 2 the Attacker can ensure that V o \u0014 m=n = 3=5\nby attacking equiprobably at the \u0085ve nodes. Then observe that by using the four patrols (2; 1; 3) ;\n(2; 4; 5) ; (3; 4; 5) ; (1; 4; 5) with respective probabilities 2=5; 1=5; 1=5; 1=5 the Patroller ensures any\nattack at any node will be intercepted with probability 3=5 and thus that V o \u0015 3=5: Note that\nif edge (1; 4) is removed, the Value V o goes down to 1\/2; the Attacker chooses nodes 1 and 5\nequiprobably and the Patroller chooses the \u0085rst three of the above patrols with probabilities\n1=2; 1=4; 1=4:\n4 Generic Strategies\nIn general, the type of strategies available to the Patroller depends crucially on the path and\ncircuit structure of the underlying graph Q: However, for purposes of analysis, it is possible to\nidentify certain generic strategy types which are available on all graphs; or on all graphs in a\nclass. We study three generic strategies for the Attacker: the uniform strategy, the diametrical\nstrategy, and the independent strategy.\n4.1 The uniform strategy\nOur \u0085rst strategy is an Attacker strategy called the uniform strategy, in which the attack [i; I]\nhas i and I chosen equiprobably and independently over their domains. That is, a random node\nis attacked at a random time. In the periodic game this strategy is the equiprobable mixture\nof the nT possible attacks. For the purposes of the next result, we make use of a standard\nde\u0085nition:\nDe\u0085nition 7 A graph is bipartite if it has no odd cycles.\nThe reader will note that (for example) all trees are bipartite.\n15\nWe have already shown that V \u0014 mn . For bipartite graphs we are able to tighten this bound.\nLemma 8 If T is odd and Q is bipartite, the bound of Lemma 2 can be tightened to V p \u0014\n(T\u00001)m+1\nnT . This bound is guaranteed by the Attacker adopting the uniform strategy in the\nperiodic game.\nProof. In the uniform strategy, all nT possible attacks are adopted with probability 1=(nT ): If\nT is odd, and there are no odd cycles (because Q is bipartite), then for any w, w (t) = w (t+ 1)\nfor some t in the periodic game: In these two periods (that is, t and t + 1), at most m + 1 of\nthe attacks can be intercepted, and as before at most m in each of the other T \u0000 2 periods. So\nat most (T \u0000 2)m + (m+ 1) = (T \u0000 1)m + 1 attacks can be intercepted altogether, giving the\ndesired inequality.\n4.2 The diametrical strategy\nThe diameter \u0016d of a graph Q is given by \u0016d = maxi;i02N d (i; i0) : A pair of nodes at distance \u0016d is\ncalled diametrical, and the Attacker\u0092s diametrical strategy is to attack these nodes equiprobably\nduring a random time interval I: It is easy to show the following. If \u0016d is very large with respect\nto m and T then it is clear the best the Patroller can do against the diametrical strategy is\nto wait at one of the nodes and win half the time. On the other hand if m and T are large,\nthe best the Patroller can do in the one-o\u00a4 game is go back and forth repeatedly on a geodesic\nbetween the diametrical points and win with probability m=\n\u0000\n2 \u0016d\n\u0001\n: Since she cannot do better\nin the periodic game, we have the following.\nLemma 9 V \u0014 max \u0002m= \u00002 \u0016d\u0001 ; 1=2\u0003 : The diametrical strategy guarantees this payo\u00a4.\n4.3 The independent strategy\nThe graph theoretic notion of independence and covering numbers has already been shown to\nbe useful in accumulation games (Alpern and Fokkink, 2008). We give here modi\u0085ed versions\nof these concepts.\nDe\u0085nition 10 A patrol w is called intercepting if it intercepts every attack on a node that it\ncontains. That is, if a node i lies on a patrol w; then it appears in any subpath of w of length\nm: A set of intercepting patrols is called a covering set if every node of Q is contained in at\nleast one of the patrols. The covering number J is the minimum cardinality of any covering\nset.\n16\nDe\u0085nition 11 If, for any two nodes i and j, any patrol which intercepts an attack at node\ni in attack interval I, cannot also intercept an attack at j in attack interval I, then i and j\nwill be said to be independent. In the one-o\u00a4 game Go; this is equivalent to requiring any\ntwo nodes to satisfy d (i; i0) \u0015 m; in the periodic game Gp, they must satisfy d (i; i0) \u0015 m or\nT \u0014 2 d (i; i0) (because the Patroller has to return to her starting point by the end of the period).\nThe independence number I is the cardinality of a maximal independent set.\nObviously I \u0014 J : Observe that both I and J depend on the parameters Q;T;m and on\nthe version of the game that is played, Go or Gp: For example, when T = 3 and m = 3; the node\nsubset f1; 3g of L3 is independent for the periodic game but not for the one-o\u00a4 game.\nFor the Attacker, the independent strategy is to \u0085x an attack interval and then choose the\nattack node equiprobably from some maximal independent set. For the Patroller, the covering\nstrategy is to choose equiprobably from a minimal set of covering patrols.\nNote that for T = 2; patrols can be identi\u0085ed with edges of Q, so these de\u0085nitions reduce to\nthe usual notion of an independent set not having adjacent nodes and a covering set consisting\nof edges.\nLemma 12 1J \u0014 V \u0014 1I (with V = 1=I when I = J ).\nProof. The Attacker\u0092s independent strategy gives the upper bound and the Patroller\u0092s covering\nstrategy gives the lower bound.\nThe cases where I = J deal with many patrolling games. For example, we can use this\ntechnique to give another solution to the kite graph KT of Figure 2 for the periodic game with\nT = m = 3: Here the nodes 2, 3, and 5 form an independent set (because 2d (i; i0) = 4 \u0015 3 = T )\nand intercepting patrols on the top left, top right and bottom edges (period 3 patrols of the\nform (a; a; b; a; a; b : : : )) form a covering set. Thus Lemma 12 gives V = 1=I = 1=3; as we\ndemonstrated earlier by another method.\n5 Patrolling on Special Classes of Graphs\nWe have no single form of analysis that is su\u00a2 ciently robust to give the Value of an arbitrary\npatrolling game; in general the Value would have to be obtained computationally. However for\ncertain classes of graphs we can determine either the Value in terms of the parameters m and n\n(the number of nodes), or bounds on the Value: These classes are Hamiltonian graphs, bipartite\ngraphs and line graphs.\n17\n5.1 Hamiltonian graphs\nA Hamiltonian graph is a graph containing at least one cycle which visits each node exactly\nonce (i.e. a Hamiltonian cycle). A special case of the Hamiltonian graphs is the simple cycle\nwith n nodes Cn. (Another special case is the complete graph Kn:) The existence of a natural\ncycle in the underlying graph is a common feature of the problem faced in application settings,\nas often the area to be patrolled will be physically compact (consider, e.g. patrolling a campus).\nNote that if m \u0015 n the Patroller can win by following the Hamiltonian cycle, so we assume that\nm < n: We de\u0085ne a random Hamiltonian patrol to be one which \u0085xes some Hamiltonian cycle,\nstarts at a random node i, and follows the cycle in a \u0085xed direction, repeating as required. Such\na patrol is always feasible in the one-o\u00a4 game Go and is feasible in the periodic game Gp if T is\na multiple of n: Using this mixed strategy, the Patroller can get the best possible interception\nprobability V; namely the upper bound m=n of Proposition 2.\nTheorem 13 If Q is Hamiltonian then\n1. V o = mn ;\n2. V p \u0014 mn with equality if T = kn; with k integer, and V p ! m=n as k !1 if T = kn+ \u001b\nwith k integer and 0 < \u001b < n integer:\nProof. First observe that in either case we have V \u0014 m=n by Lemma 2. In the one-o\u00a4 game,\nsuppose the Patroller adopts a random Hamiltonian patrol. Then for any attack interval I;\nw (I) is a random m-arc of the Hamiltonian cycle, and as such contains the attack node i with\nprobability m=n; as claimed. If T is a multiple of n; this strategy is also feasible in the periodic\ngame. To obtain the limiting result, note that if \u001b = T modn 6= 0; the periodic Patroller\ncan modify the random Hamiltonian patrol by waiting at a random node during a random \u001b-\ninterval. This will not hurt her unless the attack interval I overlaps the waiting interval, which\nhas probability (\u001b +m\u0000 1) =T; so\n\u0012\n1\u0000 \u001b +m\u0000 1\nT\n\u0013\nm\nn\n\u0014 V p \u0014 V o = m\nn\n; and so V p ! m\nn\n: (2)\nSince the above result applies to the cycle graph, we can use it to solve the game on some\ngraphs which can be obtained from the cycle graph by identi\u0085cation of nodes. We now solve the\n18\nperiodic Patrolling Game for the eight node graph shown below on the left of Figure 6 in the\ncase T = 10 and m = 4: First note that since the diameter is \u0016d = 5 we have from Lemma 9 that\nthe diametrical Attack strategy ensures that V \u0014 m= \u00002 \u0016d\u0001 = 4=10: By viewing the graph as a\nprojection of C10 (with Value m=10 = 4=10 from Theorem 13) we conclude from Lemma 1 Part\n4 that V \u0015 4=10; so V = 4=10:\nFigure 6. A graph shown as projection of C10\nFor the cycle Cn where m = 2, and n is even, we can re\u0085ne this result.\nProposition 14 For n even,\n1. V p(Cn; T; 2) = 2n if T is even.\n2. V p(Cn; T; 2) = 2T\u00001nT if T is odd.\nProof. For Part 1., the result follows from Lemma 12. For Part 2., Because Cn is bipartite,\nLemma 8 shows that it is bounded above by 2(T\u00001)+1nT =\n2T\u00001\nnT . To see that this is also a lower\nbound, suppose the Patroller partitions the node set into n2 pairs of adjacent nodes, i.e. disjoint\nedges. The Patroller then selects one of these edges (i0; i00) equiprobably and oscillates between\ni0 and i00. Because T is odd and the game is periodic, conditional on her choice of (i0; i00), the\nPatroller will have to repeat a node, i.e. w(t) = w(t+1) for some t, and she chooses both t and\nthe node (out of i0; i00) to repeat at random. Whichever node and time the Attacker chooses, he\nwill fail to be intercepted if he attacks at a node in N=i0; i00 or if he attacks the non-repeated\nnode at time t; otherwise he will be intercepted, and thus his probability of interception is\n1 \u0000 \u0002 2n \u0000n2 \u0000 1\u0001+ 2n \u0000 12T \u0001\u0003 = 2T\u00001nT so this is a lower bound and thus we have a Value for the\ngame.\nBecause we have in Proposition 14 results which explicitly depend on T , we can use these to\nillustrate in numerical terms an issue which we discussed in Section 2.2, namely what happens\nto the value as the T goes to the limit. In particular, we see in Figure 7 the values for the game\non C4 with m = 2 as T goes to 1. Note that, as demonstrated analytically in Subsection 2.2,\n19\nthe gap between the one-o\u00a4 and periodic games diminishes as the the value of the periodic game\nascends, but this convergence is not monotonic.\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\nT\nV\none-off\nperiodic\nFigure 7.

So we assume m \u0014 2b:\nTheorem 15 If Q is bipartite with halfsets of sizes a \u0014 b, then\n1. V o \u0014 m= (2b) ; with equality if Q is complete bipartite (Ka;b);\n2. V p \u0014 m= (2b) ; with equality if Q is complete bipartite (Ka;b) and T=2kb with k integer:\nFurther, if Q is complete bipartite (Ka;b); V p ! m= (2b) as k !1; if T = kn+ \u001b with k\ninteger and 0 < \u001b < n integer.\nProof. We \u0085rst show that V o \u0014 m= (2b) ; which then gives the weaker inequality V p \u0014 m= (2b) :\nConsider the Attacker mixed strategy of \u0085xing an attack interval I and picking the node i\n20\nequiprobably among the b elements of B: For any patrol w; the probability that a random i in B\nbelongs to w (I) equals jw (I) \\ Bj=b \u0014 (m=2) =b = m= (2b) : If m is odd, the Attacker strategy\nmust be modi\u0085ed to pick I and the shifted interval I + 1 equiprobably. In this case for any w\nwe have j (w (I) \\B) j+ jw (I + 1) \\ Bj \u0014 m and the probability that the attack is intercepted\nby any w is given by\n1\n2\nj (w (I)) j\nb\n+\n1\n2\nj (w (I + 1) \\B) j\nb\n\u0014 m\n2b\n:\nThe equality part follows for a = b from Theorem 13, as Kb;b is Hamiltonian. As in Theorem 13,\nwe have separate results for the one-o\u00a4 and periodic cases, and speci\u0085cally we are only able to\nshow that our result applies for particular or limiting values of T in the periodic case. If a < b\nthen we can obtain Ka;b from Kb;b by identifying together a subset of b\u0000 a nodes of one of the\nhalfsets of Kb;b and then applying Lemma 1 (part 4) to assert that V o (Ka;b) \u0015 V o (Kb;b) = m=2b\nin general and with a similar limiting result for the periodic case:\nIn all these cases, informally speaking, an optimal strategy for the Attacker is to \u0085x an attack\ninterval and choose the attack node equiprobably from the larger halfset; an optimal strategy for\nthe Patroller is to randomize over a collection of strategies which visit the larger half set every\nsecond time period. In the case of m = 2, the Patroller chooses an edge joining the halfsets;\nthe Attacker\u0092s and Patroller\u0092s strategies can be seen as a random choice from an independence\nand covering set respectively; in this case the Theorem is closely related to K\u00f6nig\u0092s Theorem\n(Harary, 1971, Theorem 10.2), since K\u00f6nig\u0092s Theorem states that the independence and covering\nnumbers of a bipartite graph are identical.\nTo illustrate the proof, consider the special case of the star graph Sn = K1;n\u00001 consisting of\na central node connected to n\u0000 1 extreme nodes. This models the situation where the Patroller\nhas responsibility for the safekeeping of a building which has multiple wings, accessible through\na common lobby area. We can view Sn as obtained from the even cycle graph C2(n\u00001) by\nidentifying (say) all even numbered nodes, as in Figure 8.\n21\nFigure 8. S5 obtained from C8 by node identi\u0085cation.\nThis mode of reasoning leads us to discover additional equilibrium pairs for the Hamiltonian\ncase. Consider the cycle graph Cn for even n and T a multiple of n: We saw earlier that the\nuniform strategy was optimal for the Attacker. But since Cn = Kn=2;n=2 is bipartite Theorem\n15 now gives the additional optimal strategy of attacking equiprobably on the odd (or even)\nnodes. In fact there is a further optimal Attacker strategy: since the diameter is \u0016d = n=2; the\ndiametrical strategy also gives m=\n\u0000\n2 \u0016d\n\u0001\n= m=n by Lemma 9.\n5.3 Line graphs\nLine graphs Ln seem to be particularly complex to analyze, but we give here some special cases\nwhich illustrate the techniques we have developed earlier. We note that they are important in\nthe patrolling context for their relation to the problem of patrolling a border, for example in\norder to prevent an agent from crossing a partially defended line between two regions. The\nfollowing case seems to be easy.\nTheorem 16 If Q is a line and n \u0014 m+ 1, then\n1. V o = m2(n\u00001) ;\n2. V p \u0014 m2(n\u00001) with equality if T=2k(n \u0000 1) with k integer; V p ! m2(n\u00001) as k ! 1, if\nT = kn+ \u001b with k integer and 0 < \u001b < n integer:\nProof. Since \u0016d = n\u0000 1, it follows from Lemma 9 that V p \u0014 V o \u0014 m2(n\u00001) . That this bound is\ntight follows from a use of Lemma 1 Part 4 and Theorem 13: we can arrive at Ln from C2(n\u00001)\nthrough node identi\u0085cation in the manner of Figure 1. Thus, V (Ln) \u0015 V (C2(n\u00001)) = m2(n\u00001) .\nIn most of the examples in this paper the optimal strategies have been highly random, in\nthat the players used equiprobable mixtures of similar pure strategies. We did this mainly to\nkeep things simple, but the reader should not be misled into thinking this is always the case.\nFor example, consider the game Gp (L5; 4; 3). We claim that the value of this game is 37 .\nLemma 6 tells us that V p (L5; 4; 3) \u0015 11\nV p(L2;4;3)\n+ 1\nV p(L3;4;3)\n: Since V p (L2; 4; 3) = 1 and (from\nTheorem 16) V p (L3; 4; 3) = 34 , we have that V\np (L5; 4; 3) \u0015 37 . Now consider the game from\nthe Attacker\u0092s point of view. There are four possible attack intervals I, and \u0085ve possible attack\nnodes i. Suppose the Attacker randomizes equiprobably over the intervals and over the nodes\nwith probabilities 37 each for nodes 1 and 5, and\n1\n7 for node 3. The Patroller could remain at\n22\nnode 1 or node 5 and intercept an attack with probability 37 or randomly move between either\n1 and 3 or between 3 and 5. She then has a 34 chance of intercepting an attack which will take\nplace with probability 37 and a\n3\n4 chance of intercepting an attack with will take place with\nprobability 17 ; for an overall probability of interception of\n3\n4\n\u0000\n3\n7 +\n1\n7\n\u0001\n= 37 . All other patrols yield\na lower expected payo\u00a4 and so V p (L5; 4; 3) \u0014 37 .\nNext consider Gp (L7; 5; 2) :We claim that the value of this game is 14 . We have I = 4 and so\nfrom Lemma 12 we have V p \u0014 1=4: To ensure winning with this probability, the Patroller must\nuse \"biased oscillations\" on edges (i; i0) of the form (i; i; i0; i; i0), which we denote as i \u0000 i0, with\na random time rotation. Clearly i  \u0000 i0 intercepts any attack on i and intercepts any attack\non i0 with probability 4=5 (that is unless the attack coincides with a repeated i): The optimal\nprobabilities of the biased oscillations on consecutive nodes are shown below.\n1\n4=16 2 1=16! 3 3=16 4 3=16! 5 1=16 6 4=16! 7\nAttacks on any node are intercepted with probability at least 1=4; with equality except for\nthe central node 4 (which should never be attacked at equilibrium). For example an attack\non node 2 is intercepted with probability 4=5 if either 1  \u0000 2 or 3  \u0000 2 is adopted by the\nPatroller, that is with probability (4=16 + 5=16) = 5=16: So it is intercepted with probability\n(4=5) (5=16) = 1=4:\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper we have described a simple, intuitive game theoretic model which can serve as the\nbasis for obtaining optimal randomized patrols. Our results could be used by a scheduler of\npatrols, to come up with a travel plan for a Patroller on a particular shift. Alternatively, the\nanalysis may also give insight into decisions at a more strategic level, when there is interest in\nconstructing or redesigning a facility which will have to be patrolled by a security force. For\nexample, topologies which have a Hamiltonian cycle are generally better (give higher interception\nprobability) than those which do not, which suggests that a good piece of advice might be to\ninclude a Hamiltonian cycle. However, adding Hamiltonian cycles beyond the \u0085rst such cycle\ndoes not, in our model, increase the interception probability further, suggesting that for a graph\nwhich is already cyclic, constructing additional arcs might not yield a good return on investment.\nThe assumptions of the present paper can be relaxed to yield extended models. Some of\n23\nthese models may be similar in spirit to the model of the current paper but incorporate certain\nreal-world complexities which we have abstracted away. In this case some of the results of\nthis paper transfer smoothly over. For example, nodes may have di\u00a4erent values in which\ncase Lemma 1 and Proposition 3) and some of the proof strategies (e.g. decomposition) can\nbe generalized in a straightforward way. Or to take another example, there may be multiple\npatrollers in which case one can simply \"multiply up\" the numerator of Lemma 12.\nOn the other hand, there are some super\u0085cially similar games which may require quite\ndi\u00a4erent formulations and proof strategies. For example:\n\u000f It may be natural to consider a continuous time formulation of this problem. An attack\ntakes place at any point of the network (not necessarily a node) on a continuous time\ninterval of \u0085xed length. The Patroller uses a unit speed path and wins if she is at the\nattacked point at some time during the attack interval. This would model, for example,\nthe defense of a pipeline system, and would resemble to a greater extent the classical search\ngame problem.\n\u000f The Patroller may be alerted (perhaps noisily and with some error) to the presence of\nan Attacker; and the Attacker may be alerted by a confederate who can identify when\na Patroller leaves a particular node (for example, if the Patroller is in a marked police\ncar). In this case new machinery would be required to capture the players\u0092 evolving\nknowledge state. Alternatively, it might be possible to formulate this problem so that the\nconsiderable body of knowledge about di\u00a4erential games could be applied.\n\u000f An absent-minded Patroller who randomizes anew at each time unit depending on her\nlocation could be modelled through a Markov game. Such a game may have interesting\nfeatures: for example, a Patroller who can remember which direction she has come may\nperform better on a cycle rather than a complete graph, as she is less likely to backtrack,\nthus contradicting the \"increasing in edges\" property.\nAcknowledgement 17 We would like to thank Delof von Winterfeldt for suggesting the prob-\nlem motivating the models explored in this paper to us, and to Milind Tambe for interesting\ndiscussions.
