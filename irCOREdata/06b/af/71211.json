From Skibotn, thermospheric vertical winds were measured in \nthe lower and upper thermosphere on both nights using the auroral\/airglow emissions at 557.7 and 630 nm, \nrespectively. From Ramfjord, neutral winds were measured, using the same wavelengths, parallel to the local \nmagnetic field line on the first night and in the local zenith on the second night. Vertical neutral winds in both \nheight ranges show essentially no correlation between the two stations. Some correlation between the vertical wind \nin the upper and lower thermosphere over individual stations does exist. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nDuring the nights of 8-9 and 9-10 February 1997, Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPI) were operated from the \nEISCAT radar site at Ramfjord (69.59o N, 19.23o E) and Skibotn (69.35o N, 20.36o E) in northern Scandinavia. The \n2 sites are separated by ~50 km, or equivalently ~45 km in longitude. Vertical neutral winds were measured in the \nlower and upper thermosphere using the Doppler shift of the auroral\/airglow emissions at 557.7 and 630 nm, \nrespectively. The effective emission altitude in the lower and upper thermosphere corresponds to approximately \n115 km for 557.7 nm (Price and Jacka, 1991; Smith and Hernandez, 1995; Price et al., 1995) and 240 km for 630 \nnm (Sica et al., 1986; Solomon et al. 1988), respectively. Both instruments have narrow fields of view which can \nbe orientated through movable mirrors. The Japanese FPI at Ramfjord (Ishii et al., 1997) is equipped with a \ndichroic beamsplitter and 2 detectors allowing measurements at both wavelengths simultaneously with a time \nresolution of about 1 minute. A running average of 5 minutes is used to improve the fit result. This instrument was \npointing along the local magnetic field line during the first night and in the local zenith on the second night. The \nGerman FPI at Skibotn measured in the local zenith on both nights using the same wavelengths and a 1 minute \nintegration. This FPI (Kosch et al., 1997a, 1997b) has a single detector. Due to sequential scanning of the sky (for \nhorizontal winds not presented here) and wavelengths, the measurement cycle is about 16 minutes. \n \nThe FPI permanently located at Skibotn was built in 1996 to augment the EISCAT incoherent-backscatter radar \n(Rishbeth and van Eyken, 1993) at Ramfjord. The FPI was not co-located with the radar due to strong artificial \nillumination contamination and generally greater cloud cover. Both these factors greatly reduce the effectiveness of \nground-based interferometers. The vertical wind is important for geophysical studies such as tides and gravity \nwaves but the separation between EISCAT and Skibotn may complicate any comparison. Hence, it is of interest to \nestablish how well the vertical neutral winds between the 2 sites are related, if at all. Previous studies have found \nthat the horizontal scale size of vertical thermospheric motions to be several hundred kilometers (Spencer et al., \n1982; Crickmore, 1993; Price et al., 1995).  As no suitable spectral lamp or laser exists at the chosen wavelengths, \nthere exists the problem of determining the zero wind baseline for each FPI. An estimate of the zero velocity fringe \nposition for the chosen wavelength is obtained by assuming that the vertical wind averaged over an entire night is \n   \napproximately zero. This may introduce a systematic error of 10-20 m\/s (Aruliah and Rees, 1995) since only a \nfraction of any one 24 hr period is used. \n \nAuroral optical intensities over Skibotn and Ramfjord are obtained every 10 s from the digital all-sky imager \n(DASI) (Kosch et al., 1996, 1998) located at Skibotn. This instrument has been calibrated in absolute units \n(Rayleigh) for 557.7 nm. The data has been averaged down to 1 minute time resolution. The 50 km baseline means \nthat the DASI viewing direction is not parallel to that of the Ramfjord FPI. \n \nThe first night was geomagnetically disturbed (Kp = 4- - 5o) prior to magnetic midnight (\u2248 21:30 UT) but much \nquieter thereafter (Kp = 2o - 2+). The second night was geomagnetically active throughout (Kp = 4- - 5+), especially \naround magnetic midnight. All correlation coefficients, including 95% confidence limits, are computed for zero \ntime lag only. The low time resolution at Skibotn (16 min.) means that only very small zonal winds (< 23 m\/s) \nwould result in no aliasing between the stations for other lags. This was not the case for most of the time. The 95% \nconfidence intervals for Skibotn tend to be large due to the small number of data points (< 50). For Ramfjord, the \nhigher time resolution (1 min.) gives more data points (> 250) resulting in less uncertainty. \nFig. 1. Fabry-Perot interferometer Doppler shifts and auroral intensity for the night of 8-9 February 1997. The \nRamfjord and Skibotn data are along the local magnetic field line direction and in the local zenith, respectively. Up \nis positive. The estimated error bars are also shown. \n   \nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS \n \nFor the night of 8-9 February 1997, figure 1 shows vertical winds from Skibotn for both altitudes, magnetic field \naligned winds from Ramfjord for both altitudes and the auroral intensity at 557.7 nm over both stations. The winds \nover Skibotn have been cross-correlated with the auroral optical intensity. For winds from 630 and 557.7 nm the \ncorrelation coefficients are 0 19 0 27\n0 3. .\n.\n+\n\u2212  and 0 28 0 26\n0 3. .\n.\n+\n\u2212 , respectively. This indicates a weak upwelling of the neutral gas \nwith increased particle precipitation which may be expected from localised energy inputs (Rees et al., 1984a, \n1984b) such as Joule and particle heating. This measurement has not been done for Ramfjord due to the difficulty \nin locating the correct emission volume as seen from Skibotn because of the unknown height of the emission: \nattempts have resulted in correlation coefficients of essentially zero. The winds in the upper and lower \nthermosphere over each site have been cross-correlated. For Skibotn and Ramfjord the correlation coefficients are \n0 19 0 27\n0 3. .\n.\n+\n\u2212  and 0 28 0 1\n0 1. .\n.\n+\n\u2212 , respectively, indicating weak coupling between 240 and 115 km altitude for both stations. \n \nUnfortunately, the winds between the stations cannot be cross-correlated because of the different viewing \ndirections. The magnetic field direction is ~13o south of zenith, which introduces a significant meridional wind  \nFig. 2.

Since the horizontal wind is estimated at 45o elevation, it is difficult to deconvolve it from the field \naligned observation to reproduce the vertical wind with any confidence. \n \nFor the night of 9-10 February 1997, figure 2 shows vertical winds for both altitudes, and auroral intensities at \n557.7 nm, for both stations. The winds over Skibotn have been cross-correlated with the auroral optical intensity. \nFor winds from 630 and 557.7 nm the correlation coefficients are 0 34 0 24\n0 3. .\n.\n+\n\u2212  and \u2212 +\u22120 15 0 340 31. .. , respectively. Upwelling \nof the neutral gas in the upper thermosphere with increased particle precipitation is greater than for the previous \nnight. This is consistent with the higher Kp and brighter aurora of the second night. In the lower thermosphere, the \nneutral gas shows no clear relationship with increased particle precipitation. Peteherych et al. (1985) found that the \nvertical wind from 557.7 nm would either descend or ascend in the presence of a low (110 km) or high (135 km) \naltitude aurora. Unfortunately, we have no means to determine the altitude of the aurora. The winds in the upper \nand lower thermosphere over each site have been cross-correlated. For Skibotn and Ramfjord the correlation \ncoefficients are 0 0 21\n0 27.43 .\n.\n+\n\u2212  and 0 32 0 1\n0 11. .\n.\n+\n\u2212 , respectively, indicating some coupling between 240 and 115 km altitude \nfor both stations. Compared to the previous night, coupling is greater, especially for Skibotn. This may be due to \nthe increased energy input into the thermosphere as indicated by Kp (Foster et al., 1986). Given the greater driving \ninput, it seems likely that the upper and lower thermosphere would become better correlated.  \n \nThe vertical winds have been cross-correlated between the stations. The correlation coefficients for the upper and \nlower thermosphere are 0 14 0 35\n0 39. .\n.\n+\n\u2212  and 0 02 0 31\n0 28. .\n.\n+\n\u2212 , respectively, indicating essentially no relationship at 240 or 115 \nkm altitude. The horizontal scale size for upper thermosphere vertical winds at high latitudes has been estimated at \n~360 km (Crickmore, 1993) and ~400 km (Spencer et al., 1982). Price et al. (1995) found neutral gas upwelling \nassociated with geomagnetic and auroral activity to be limited to a horizontal scale of < 800 km and < 320 km in \nthe upper and lower thermosphere, respectively. Our limited data set suggests the horizontal scale size can be < 50 \nkm in the auroral zone during geomagnetically active periods (Kp = 4- - 5+) for both altitudes. \n \nThe following may be concluded: neutral gas in the upper thermosphere tends to ascend with increased particle \nprecipitation. In the lower thermosphere, no clear relationship could be established. There is weak coupling \nbetween the vertical wind in the lower and upper thermosphere, increasing with Kp. For this limited study, the \nvertical winds over Skibotn and Ramfjord, which is a horizontal baseline of ~50 km, appear essentially \nuncorrelated. This is much less than previous findings and may prove to be a limiting factor in some studies when \ncomparing EISCAT radar data with Skibotn FPI data. \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAruliah, L. A., and D.
