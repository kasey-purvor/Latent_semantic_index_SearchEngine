Jeffreys1 and Celia A. May\nDepartment of Genetics, University of Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK\nDetecting rare sequence variants in genomic DNA is central to the analysis of de novo mutation and recombination\nevents and the detection of rare pathological mutations in mixed cell populations. Current PCR techniques suffer\nfrom noise that limits detection to variants present at a frequency of at least 10\u22124\u201310\u22125 per cell. We now describe an\nalternative approach that recovers genomic DNA molecules containing a known single-nucleotide variant by\nhybridization selection using a biotinylated allele-specific oligonucleotide, followed by hybrid capture on\nstreptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads and subsequent analysis by PCR. This technique of DNA enrichment by\nallele-specific hybridization (DEASH) is fast, effective for all tested single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and can\nrecover large (>10 kb) single-stranded molecules. A single round of DEASH is effective in separating haplotypes from\ngenomic DNA and can not only readily detect and validate DNA molecules containing a single base change at a\nfrequency of 10\u22125 per cell, but can also place these changes within the context of an extended haplotype. This\ntechnique offers a new approach to the analysis of mutation and recombination, and has the potential to detect very\nrare de novo base substitutions.\nThe detection of sequence variants present at very low frequency\nin genomic DNA remains a major challenge in molecular genet-\nics, of direct relevance to the detection of germline and somatic\nde novo mutation events and other forms of spontaneous ge-\nnomic rearrangement (Tiemann-Boege et al. 2002). It is also cen-\ntral to the detection and characterization of rare recombinant\nmolecules in bulk genomic DNA, essential for high-resolution\nanalysis of meiotic crossover and gene conversion (Jeffreys et al.\n1998a, 2001). Rare variant detection is also important for the\nearly detection of pathological mutations, particularly in cancer\n(Sidransky et al. 1991, 1992; Tada et al. 1993; Boyle et al. 1994;\nMao et al. 1994; Mills et al. 1995; Smith-Ravin et al. 1995), and\nfor the identification of tumor cells in patients in relapse. It is\nalso relevant to prenatal diagnosis using fetal cells present in\nmaternal blood (Adinolfi et al. 1989; Lo et al. 1994; Hengst-\nschlager et al. 1997; Zhang et al. 2000; Reed et al. 2002), and to\nstudies of the accumulation of somatic mutations in aging indi-\nviduals (see Crow 1999; Knight 2000; Vijg 2000; Berdanier and\nEverts 2001).\nMany methods for detecting low-frequency variants in ge-\nnomic DNA use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify\nmutant plus wild-type target, followed by interrogating these\nproducts by sequencing, oligonucleotide ligation, restriction di-\ngestion, mass spectrometry, or hybridization with allele-specific\noligonucleotides to identify the variant against the background\nof wild-type DNA (see, e.g., Saiki et al. 1986; Haliassos et al. 1989;\nLaken et al. 1998; Gerry et al. 1999; Vogelstein and Kinzler 1999).\nOther methods use allele-specific PCR to amplify products selec-\ntively from the low-frequency variant, with or without additional\nselection, for example by digesting PCR products with a restric-\ntion enzyme that specifically cleaves and renders unamplifiable\nthe wild-type product (Gibbs et al. 1989; Newton et al. 1989; Cha\net al. 1992; Fox et al. 1998; Haque et al. 1998; Tiemann-Boege et\nal. 2002). Both approaches have inherent limitations due to base\nmisincorporation during PCR which creates false mutant prod-\nucts from the wild-type allele, and to the lack of total specificity\nof allele-specific primers. As a result, all current approaches have\nlimited sensitivity, with the most sensitive assays being capable\nof detecting at best one mutant molecule against a background of\n104\u2013105 wild-type molecules. Although this is adequate for many\napplications, increased sensitivity is essential for detecting very\nrare spontaneous mutation events, particularly in the human\ngermline, where the only currently feasible approach is the direct\ndetection of mutations in gametic (sperm) DNA (Tiemann-Boege\net al. 2002), and it would also offer potential for the very early\ndetection of pathological mutations.\nMost mutation detection systems yield an assay signal that\nis difficult to validate in terms of the number of mutant mol-\necules detected. This can be overcome in part by analyzing mul-\ntiple samples, each containing limited DNA (typically 50 genome\nequivalents), yielding direct information on numbers of mutant\nmolecules (digital PCR; Vogelstein and Kinzler 1999). However,\nthe large number of PCR reactions required, together with back-\nground noise arising from PCR misincorporation, is likely to\nlimit this approach to detection levels of about 10\u00013. Another\nlimitation of many mutation detection procedures is that they\nreplace the mutant site with a PCR primer sequence and yield\nshort amplicons containing little if any information other than\nthe presence of a putative mutant allele.\nThe unifying problem behind all of these PCR approaches\nfor detecting rare variants is replication infidelity during ampli-\nfication. The solution therefore is to collect mutant DNA mol-\necules from genomic DNA prior to analyzing them by PCR. We\nnow describe a rapid method that achieves this goal and which\nshould be applicable to any base-substitutional variant. This\nmethod is a modification of traditional techniques for enriching\nnucleic acids by hybridization with biotinylated DNA probes\n1Corresponding author.\nE-MAIL ajj@le.ac.uk; FAX 44-116-252-3378.\nArticle and publication are at http:\/\/www.genome.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1101\/\ngr.1214603.\nMethods\n2316 Genome Research 13:2316\u20132324 \u00a92003 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ISSN 1088-9051\/03 $5.00; www.genome.org\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 19, 2013 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \n(see, e.g., Abe 1992), and uses allele-specific oligonucleotides to\nfractionate DNAmolecules differing by a single base substitution.\nThis method of DNA enrichment by allele-specific hybridization\n(DEASH) is capable of substantial purification of DNA molecules\ncarrying any given base substitution, and further can recover\nlarge DNA molecules containing additional marker information\nrelevant to studies, for example, of recombination and of the\nparent-of-origin of a de novo mutation.\nRESULTS\nThe Principles of DEASH\nThe DEASH procedure is outlined in Figure 1. The input is\ndouble-stranded DNA containing a mixture of molecules that\ndiffer in the chosen single-base substitution; this mixture could\nbe due to SNP heterozygosity in a single individual, or could\nrepresent a mixed DNA sample, or be due to de novo mutation.\nThis DNA is mixed with a biotinylated allele-specific oligonucleo-\ntide (bio-ASO) directed to the chosen variant, plus a competitor\nASO complementary to the other allele to increase the specificity\nof hybridization. The mixture is thermally denatured and hybrid-\nized, and bio-ASO\/target hybrids are captured on streptavidin-\ncoated paramagnetic Dynabeads. The captured hybrid is then\nthermally eluted from the beads in low-salt buffer, yielding\nsingle-stranded target enriched for the chosen variant and free\nfrom bio-ASO. Additional target can be recovered by adding bio-\nASO to the unbound DNA and subjecting it to further cycles of\nre-extraction using DEASH. In addition, the enriched target can\nbe purified further simply by adding buffer, bio-ASO, and com-\npetitor ASO and proceeding with a second round of DEASH (re-\nenrichment; Fig. 1).\nTo minimize damage to target DNA, the DEASH protocol\nuses a modified high-pH buffer based on a standard PCR buffer\n(Jeffreys et al. 1988). Pilot experiments\nindicated that PCR-amplifiable single-\nstranded DNA is thermally stable in this\nbuffer; human genomic DNA subjected\nto 2 min at 96\u00b0C followed by 15 min at\n70\u00b0C showed no detectable loss of an\namplifiable 4-kb target compared with\nuntreated genomic DNA (data not\nshown). Recovered single-stranded tar-\nget DNA is stable and can be stored for at\nleast 6 months at\u000120\u00b0C with no loss of\namplifiable DNA. The DEASH buffer has\nthe added advantage of being fully com-\npatible with PCR analysis.\nSeparation of Haplotypes From\nPCR Products\nDEASH was optimized using PCR prod-\nucts from a region adjacent to human\nminisatellite MS32 (Fig. 2A; Jeffreys et al.\n1998b). A person was chosen who was\nheterozygous for a SNP (BbC\/G) adjacent\nto a length-heterozygous short tandem\nrepeat (STR), the latter providing a\nsimple assay for haplotype separation\nusing bio-ASOs directed to BbC or BbG.\nVarious parameters of the DEASH proto-\ncol were optimized on PCR products\nfrom this person (concentrations of bio-\nASO and competitor ASO, annealing\ntemperature, time of annealing and sub-\nsequent binding to streptavidin mag-\nnetic beads, bead washing conditions,\nand the elution temperature and time re-\nquired to release single-stranded target\nDNA). Yields of each haplotype were es-\ntimated by PCR amplification of input\nand recovered DNA, limiting PCR to the\nexponential phase of amplification and\ncomparing PCR product yields by aga-\nrose gel electrophoresis. Yield estimation\nwas adjusted for the fact that unfraction-\nated double-stranded DNA yields twice\nas much PCR product as from an equal\nnumber of single-stranded molecules.\nThe optimized protocol (see Methods)\nwas rapid, allowing fractionation in 20\nmin and giving excellent yields (>50%)\nFigure 1 The principles of DEASH. (A) DNA containing a mixture of molecules differing by the\nchosen base substitution (circle) is mixed with a biotinylated ASO (gray, with biotin shown as a square)\nand the corresponding competitor ASO (black) directed to the alternative variant, then denatured and\nhybridized. (B) Streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads (Dynal) are added to bind the bio-ASO\/target\nhybrid and are then separated with a magnet (C). Bound hybrid is thermally eluted (D), releasing the\nenriched single-stranded target and leaving the bio-ASO still bound to the beads. Further target can\nbe recovered by adding bio-ASO to the unbound DNA, denaturing, and processing as above (re-\nextraction). Enriched target can be purified further by adding buffer, bio-ASO, and competitor ASO,\nfollowed by DEASH (re-enrichment).\nDNA Enrichment by Allele-Specific Hybridization\nGenome Research 2317\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 19, 2013 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nof DNA eluted at 60\u00b0C, with little target being released in the\n20\u00b0C pre-elution or 80\u00b0C post-elution washes (Fig. 2B). Substan-\ntial separation of haplotypes was achieved (>100-fold enrich-\nment using BbC and 50-fold enrichment with BbG). Enrichment\nwas robust over a broad range of annealing temperatures (Fig.\n2C), with improved haplotype separation but reduced yield of\nBbG-selected DNA at higher annealing temperatures.\nSeparating Haplotypes From Genomic DNA\nTo test whether DEASH could also be applied to genomic DNA to\nrecover much larger single-stranded DNA fragments, sperm DNA\nwas fractionated from a person heterozygous for BbC\/G and car-\nrying two different length minisatellite MS32 alleles (Fig. 3A).\nBbC\/G fractionation gave very low (<1%) yields of enriched\nDNA, as assayed by amplifying the minisatellite itself (data not\nshown). However, yields improved substantially using DNA di-\ngested with PvuII, which cleaves upstream of the minisatellite\nand 582 bp downstream of BbC\/G (Fig.\n3B). A single round of DEASH using bio-\ntinylated BbG gave 30% recovery of the\n10.2-kb target, with 100-fold enrich-\nment of the selected allele. Yields of the\nlarger (12.5-kb) target using BbC were\nlower (\u223c8%) but the purification was ex-\ncellent (200-fold). As predicted, more\ntarget could be recovered from the un-\nbound DNA using additional cycles of\nDEASH (Fig. 3B); three cycles of re-\nextraction increased overall yields for\nBbG and BbC to about 60% and 20% re-\nspectively, with little if any decrease in\nthe level of purification achieved at each\nround of fractionation.\nDEASH recovers only one of the\ntwo complementary strands of a target,\nwith the other strand remaining in the\nunbound genomic DNA fraction (Fig. 1).\nBecause both strands serve as templates\nfor the PCR assay, it was not possible to\nassay target depletion from the unbound\nDNA during purification. To circumvent\nthis problem and directly test levels of\ndepletion, we recovered single-stranded\nDNA by selection with bio-BbG and used\nthis as target in an additional round of\nenrichment with re-extractions using\nbio-BbG. Assaying both unbound and\nbound DNA showed that most of the tar-\nget was recovered by a single cycle of en-\nrichment; after two further cycles of re-\nextraction, about 50% of starting target\nwas recovered in a PCR-amplifiable\nform, with less than 5% of target DNA\nremaining in the unbound DNA fraction\n(Fig. 3C). Proportionately more target\nwas recovered in the first cycle of extrac-\ntion compared to genomic DNA (Fig. 3,\ncf. B and C). This suggests that low yields\nseen particularly with unrestricted ge-\nnomic DNA may be due to inter-\nmolecular hybridization between repeat\nDNA that could sterically hinder bind-\ning of the bio-ASO\/target hybrid to the\nstreptavidin beads. Such hybridization\nwould also create high-molecular-\nweight aggregates that might promote\nshearing of the bound target, again reducing yields of intact tar-\nget DNA.\nBulk Fractionation of Genomic DNA\nDEASH can be readily scaled to process large amounts of genomic\nDNA, as shown for SNP-mediated haplotype separation of a tar-\nget within the class II region of the major histocompatibility\ncomplex (MHC) where, in contrast to the MS32 target, there was\nno length difference between haplotypes and where the selector\nsite was located more internally within the target restriction frag-\nment (Fig. 4A). Excellent haplotype separation was achieved us-\ning a bio-ASO directed to SNP JJK8. About 60% of target was\nrecovered after four cycles of enrichment on 16 \u00b5g genomic\nDNA, as estimated both by allele-specific PCR analysis of the\nrecovered target using the distal heterozygous SNP JJ6T\/C (Fig.\n4B) and by Poisson analysis of the number of amplifiable mol-\nFigure 2 Use of DEASH to separate haplotypes from PCR products.

The correct haplotype was enriched 120-\nfold. Yields declined substantially in later cycles of re-extraction,\nand were accompanied by a modest decrease in the level of pu-\nrification (Fig. 4C).\nThis MHC target region contained multiple additional SNP\nheterozygosities in the individual tested (Fig. 4A). Linkage phase\nof these SNPs relative to the JJK8 selector site could be easily\ndetermined by ASO hybridization. Analysis of each SNP on dot\nblots of PCR products from the enriched target allowed complete\nhaplotypes to be rapidly established (data not shown).\nProperties of Bio-ASOs Used in DEASH\nTwelve different bio-ASOs directed to various human SNPs near\nminisatellite MS32 (Jeffreys et al. 1998b), within the MHC (Jef-\nfreys et al. 2001), and in the pseudoautosomal SHOX gene (May\net al. 2002) were tested for their efficiency in separating haplo-\ntypes from restriction enzyme-digested genomic DNA (Table 1).\nAll gave good yields of the enriched haplotype and, in most\ncases, excellent purification, in three instances so great (>200\u2013\n300-fold) that the true level of enrichment could not be deter-\nmined. Fractionation was successful for all classes of polymor-\nphism tested (transitions, transversions, and an insertion\/\ndelet ion var iant) , and could be\nsuccessfully applied to SNPs within an\nAlu repeat (AB12\/5 and AB13) and in\nsimple-sequence DNA (AB2). Yields and\nlevels of purification did not correlate\nwith the GC content of the bio-ASO, and\neven very AT-rich ASOs could be used to\nfractionate DNA. Only two ASOs gave\nrelatively low levels of enrichment\n(JJK10, JJK12; Table 1). The first is within\na GT repeat sequence, and the second is\nin an extensive polypurine region which\ncontains additional targets fairly well\nmatched to the bio-ASO sequence (data\nnot shown). Both SNPs were therefore\ntested for re-enrichment by subjecting\nenriched target DNA to a second round\nof DEASH (Fig. 1). The levels of purifica-\ntion increased in a multiplicative fash-\nion, from sevenfold to 50-fold for JJK12,\nand from 13-fold to 140-fold for JJK10\n(data not shown). Yields similarly\nshowed a proportionate drop, from 60%\nto about 25%, indicating a fairly con-\nstant loss of amplifiable target per round\nof DEASH.\nUse of DEASH to Detect\nLow-Frequency Changes in\nHuman DNA\nTo illustrate how DEASH can be used to\ndetect rare changes in human genomic\nDNA, we chose the HLA-DMB region\n(Fig. 4), which we previously showed\ncontains a strong meiotic crossover hot\nspot termedDMB2 detectable by analysis\nof sperm DNA (Jeffreys et al. 2001). We\nused bio-ASO fractionation as a novel\nmethod to investigate crossover and\ngene conversion events in this region\n(Fig. 5). The principle was to enrich\nsperm DNA for one SNP allele (JJK6A)\nwithin the hot spot, then use nested al-\nlele-specific PCR against two distal up-\nstream markers from the opposite hap-\nlotype to amplify recombinant mol-\necules that had undergone recom-\nbination between this marker pair and\nthe marker used for bio-ASO enrich-\nment. Dot-blot analysis of these PCR\nproducts by hybridization with labeled\nASOs revealed crossover molecules at\na frequency of 8\u000210\u00015 per sperm, as\nseen in previous studies using repulsion-\nFigure 3 Separating haplotypes from human genomic DNA. (A) The target region, including the\nselector site (BbC\/G) and minisatellite MS32 used to test for haplotype separation. Alu repeats are\nmarked with arrowheads. (B) Haplotype separation. Four \u00b5g sperm DNA from a man with the two\nhaplotypes shown in (A) was digested with PvuII and fractionated by DEASH using either bio-BbC or\nbio-BbG. Unbound DNA was subjected to two further cycles of extraction after adding bio-BbC or\nbio-BbG. Aliquots of eluted fractions (2% of each eluate) were assayed by long PCR amplification with\nprimers C and D, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blot hybridization with a\n32P-labeled MS32 repeat probe. Yields were estimated by comparison with decreasing inputs of un-\nfractionated PvuII-digested sperm DNA (48\u20130.16 ng). The autoradiograph was overexposed to show\ntraces of contaminating haplotype. (C) Assaying depletion of target from unbound DNA during\nDEASH. BbG-fractionated single-stranded DNA from B (60\u00b0C eluates pooled from all three extraction\ncycles) was subjected to three cycles of extraction\/re-extraction using bio-BbG. Unbound (left) and\nbound (right) DNA recovered after each cycle was analyzed by PCR as in B and compared to input DNA\n(in). Note that primers C and D are located away from the selector site, allowing the unbound DNA\nto be analyzed by PCR even though it contains competitor BbC ASO. The faint residual 8.7-kb signal\nin the re-extracted fraction 1 is that expected for a single molecule of DNA, and given repeat instability\nand recombinational activity at MS32 (Jeffreys et al. 1998a,b), may be a mutant\/recombinant molecule\ncontaining BbG rather than a contaminating BbC allele. For this reason, the MS32 system cannot be\nused to estimate levels of additional purification achieved by re-extraction.\nDNA Enrichment by Allele-Specific Hybridization\nGenome Research 2319\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 19, 2013 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nphase allele-specific PCR to recover crossover molecules from\nsperm DNA (Jeffreys et al. 2001). In addition, molecules were\ndetected that had undergone transfer of the selected SNP allele\nalone from one haplotype to the other. More extensive analyses\nof DNA enriched using one of five different bio-ASOs showed\nthat these single-base switches (39 detected in total, in 560 PCR\nreactions) were only seen at the selected SNP, and were never\nobserved at other, nonselected SNPs (data not shown). This pro-\nvides strong evidence that these switches cannot be artifacts aris-\ning during PCR amplification of enriched DNA and must instead\nrepresent genuine single-base changes present in sperm DNA.\nTheir frequency (4\u000210\u00015 per sperm for\nJJK6) is far higher than the estimated\nrate of de novo base substitution in the\nhuman germline (2\u000210\u00018 per nucleo-\ntide site; Nachman and Crowell 2000),\nand, together with their association with\na recombination hot spot, strongly sug-\ngests that they have arisen by highly lo-\ncalized gene conversion events within\nthe crossover hot spot.\nDISCUSSION\nDEASH is a powerful, flexible method for\nfractionating not only PCR products but\nalso genomic DNA for known base sub-\nstitutional variants. It can be applied\nequally efficiently to small amounts\n(100 ng or less) of genomic DNA and to\nbulk fractionation at the 10 \u00b5g level\n(data not shown), and could be readily\nscaled to process even larger amounts of\nDNA. DEASH provides a simple, rapid\nmethod for haplotype separation at the\n10-kb scale, requiring only the presence\nof a known SNP heterozygosity and pro-\nviding an approach to haplotype deter-\nmination that complements traditional\nmethods using pedigrees, allele-specific\nPCR, or chromosome separation in so-\nmatic cell hybrids (Papadopoulos et al.\n1995) to resolve haplotypes. Further\nwork will reveal whether larger genomic\ntargets can be efficiently fractionated\nand haplotyped by DEASH.\nAnalysis of sperm recombination\nevents has shown that just one round of\nDEASH enrichment giving 100-fold pu-\nrification is sufficient to detect single\nbase changes (arising by gene conver-\nsion) at a frequency of 10\u00015 per cell (Fig.\n5; additional data not shown). Without\nfractionation, the conversion events de-\ntected in Figure 5 would have required\nthe analysis of 2000 PCR reactions, each\ncontaining 50 molecules (using ASO hy-\nbridization, this is the pool size limit for\nreliably detecting a mutant molecule\nagainst the background of wild-type\nmolecules). Furthermore, such large\nnumbers of reactions would generate the\noccasional false \u201cmutant\u201d signal due to\nPCR misincorporation during the earli-\nest rounds of PCR amplification, gener-\nating a background noise that would\nmask any low-frequency events. DEASH\ncircumvents these problems by greatly reducing the numbers of\nmolecules screened for mutation, and further validates the mu-\ntants by showing that a given mutant is only detected if DNA has\nbeen enriched using the relevant bio-ASO.\nThe sensitivity of DEASH in detecting rare variants reaches\nor surpasses the detection limits of all other mutation detection\nsystems based on direct analysis of DNA. It is already sufficiently\ngreat to enable in principle the direct detection of the de novo\ngermline mutations in sperm DNA that cause achondroplasia\nand Apert syndrome, both of which show remarkably high spon-\ntaneous mutation rates, of 3\u000210\u00015 and 1\u000210\u00015\u20135\u000210\u00015, re-\nFigure 4 Bulk separation of haplotypes within the human MHC.

Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nspectively (Cohen et al. 1992; Czeizel et al. 1993; Bellus et al.\n1995; Tiemann-Boege et al. 2002). One remarkable feature of\nDEASH is its potential for indefinite purification of any chosen\ntarget. The degree of enrichment at each cycle of DEASH is de-\ntermined by the relative likelihoods that a correct and incorrect\ntarget molecule will be bound. In theory, these likelihoods will be\nconstant at each cycle of DEASH (they\nare analogous to partition coefficients\nbetween the unbound and bound\n\u201cphases\u201d), allowing in principle the in-\ndefinite purification of any chosen tar-\nget. This concept of multiplicative en-\nrichment has been confirmed for two\nbio-ASOs giving relatively low levels of\npurification. If more generally true, then\nvariant detection at very low levels\nshould be readily achievable. For ex-\nample, two rounds of enrichment at\n100-fold purification per round should\nallow the detection of mutation events\nas rare as 10\u00017 per cell, and there is in\ntheory no reason why additional rounds\nof purification should not increase sen-\nsitivity even further. The main limita-\ntion in detecting extremely rare muta-\ntion events will be the sheer mass of ge-\nnomic DNA that would need to be\nanalyzed, compounded by progressive\ndecrease in yields due to incomplete\nbinding of target and any damage\ncaused to DNA during the DEASH proce-\ndure.\nQuantitation of the rate of gene\nconversion events detected in sperm\nDNA was straightforward, given that the\nenrichment separated the two progeni-\ntor haplotypes and that the number of\nprogenitor haplotype molecules in the\npurified DNA assayed for recombination\nwas known (Fig. 5). In contrast, the en-\nrichment and quantitation of de novo\nmutant molecules, or low-frequency\nvariant molecules present in a mixed\nDNA sample, will involve the removal of\nalmost all wild-type DNA and will not\ngive information on the efficiency of re-\ncovery of mutant molecules. It will\ntherefore be necessary to develop re-\nporter constructs carrying the mutation\nthat can be added to the starting ge-\nnomic DNA, providing an internal con-\ntrol from which yields and thus muta-\ntion rates can be determined.\nDEASH enrichment is flexible and\ncould be readily extended to sequential\nenrichment using two or more different\nbio-ASOs. For instance, it should be pos-\nsible to recover recombinant molecules\nwithout using PCR. Thus, if recombi-\nnants are required between haplotypes\nA-B and a-b, then bio-ASO fractionation\nwith marker A followed by the repulsion-\nphase marker b would enrich for A-b re-\ncombinants. Another feature of DEASH is\nthat it should be readily amenable to au-\ntomation, allowing the parallel processing\nof multiple samples in, for example, the detection of low-frequency\nmutations in patient samples. Finally, DEASH is currently the only\ntechnology with the potential to detect directly very-low-frequency\nde novo base substitutional mutations in the human germline, an\narea of major importance in understanding the dynamics of heri-\ntable mutation and the origin of pathological mutations.\nFigure 5 Use of DEASH to analyze recombination in human sperm. (A) The principle of detection.\nSperm DNA molecules from a region with multiple SNP heterozygosities (circles) will contain a low\nfrequency of recombinant molecules (crossovers and gene conversions). Sperm DNA fractionation (i)\nusing a bio-ASO specific for the gray haplotype will recover gray haplotype molecules, plus any\nrecombinant molecules that include the gray selector site, and will deplete though not totally eliminate\nmolecules from the black haplotype. PCR using an allele-specific primer from the black haplotype (Bl)\nplus a universal (not allele-specific) primer (U) (ii) will generate PCR products only from recombinant\nmolecules and from any remaining molecules of the black haplotype. (B) The HLA-DMB target region,\nas in Fig. 4, in the man tested. Sperm DNA (12 \u00b5g) was digested with HindIII plus BlpI and enriched\nusing bio-JJK6A directed to the gray haplotype. Assays as in Fig. 4, as well as Poisson analyses of\nextreme dilutions of the DNA, showed that the enriched DNA contained 440,000 amplifiable mol-\necules of the gray haplotype and was 130-fold enriched. Multiple aliquots of this DNA, each containing\n4000 molecules of the gray haplotype plus 30 remaining molecules of the black haplotype, were\namplified using the allele-specific primer JJ6C and the universal primer F, then re-amplified with primer\nJJ7C plus the universal primer G. (C) These re-amplified PCR products were dot-blot hybridized with\n32P-labeled ASOs specific for each of the gray alleles. Four recombinants were detected, with hybrid-\nization signals consistent with them being present at a level of 3% of the PCR products from the\nremaining black haplotype. Two were crossovers with exchange points mapping to the intervals\nJJK9-JJK18 and JJK16-JJK5, respectively. The other two were conversions (arrowed) affecting only the\nselector site JJK6. These conversions were detected among 28 PCRs containing 112,000 molecules of\nthe gray haplotype, giving a conversion rate of 2\/112,000 = 1.8\u0002 10\u00015 per sperm.\nJeffreys and May\n2322 Genome Research\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 19, 2013 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nMETHODS\nOligonucleotides\nAll bio-ASOs and competitor ASOs were 18-nt-long, with the al-\nlele-specific base 11 nt from the 5\u0003 end. 5\u0003 biotinylated ASOs were\nHPLC-purified before use. Single- and triple-biotinylated ASOs\n(Oswel) gave very similar yields in DEASH, and most fraction-\nations were performed with single-biotinylated ASOs.\nMS32 PCR primers used were: A 5\u0003-GTC AAG GCA GAT TTG\nAAG GGA G-3\u0003; B 5\u0003-GGT AGC CAC ATC TCT GCA TGA TCT\nC-3\u0003; C 5\u0003-CCA TGC CCA GCC TTC ATT CTT TTC-3\u0003; D 5\u0003-CTT\nCCT CGT TCT CCT CAG CCC TAG-3\u0003.

DEASH buffer (1 \u0002\nDEB) was 45 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.8, 11 mM ammonium sul-\nphate, 4.5 mMMgCl2, 6.7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 4.4 \u00b5M EDTA,\nplus 2 \u00b5g\/mL single-stranded high-molecular-weight herring\nsperm DNA as carrier. Target DNA (PCR products or up to 4 \u00b5g\nrestricted genomic DNA) was added to a final volume of 20 \u00b5L 1\n\u0002 DEB plus 0.38 \u00b5M bio-ASO and 1.5 \u00b5M competitor ASO in a\n0.2-mL PCR tube (ABgene Thermo-Tube). Larger quantities of\ngenomic DNA were processed in proportionately larger volumes.\nDNAwas denatured at 96\u00b0C for 75 sec on a GeneAmp PCR System\n9700 thermal cycler (PE Applied Biosystems), then step-down\nannealed from (A+9)\u00b0C to (A+1)\u00b0C over 3 min (where A\u00b0C is the\noptimal annealing temperature determined empirically), and\nheld at A\u00b0C for 2 min. DNA was then transferred to a siliconized\nEppendorf tube (Treff Lab polypropylene tube siliconized with\ndimethyldichlorosilane solution, BDH; siliconization is essential\nto prevent nonspecific recovery of single-stranded DNA) and\nheld at A\u00b0C. Hybrids were captured by adding 0.18 mg (1.3 \u00b5L)\nDynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (Dynal Biotech; pre-washed twice\nwith 1 \u0002 DEB) and allowing binding to proceed for 10 min at\nA\u00b0C, with occasional gentle mixing to keep the beads suspended.\nBeads were immediately separated at room temperature (<30 sec)\nusing a Dynal MPC-E magnetic particle concentrator, and un-\nbound DNA transferred to a 0.2-mL PCR tube. Beads were washed\nat room temperature with 50 \u00b5L 1 \u0002 DEB containing 10 \u00b5g\/mL\nBSA (Ultra Pure, Ambion), then with 50 \u00b5L DEB\/BSA for 1 min at\nA\u00b0C. Washed beads were resuspended in 30 \u00b5L elution buffer\n(0.14 \u0002 DEB containing 5 \u00b5g\/mL single-stranded herring DNA)\nand transferred to a fresh siliconized Eppendorf tube at 20\u00b0C.\nBeads were separated and the 20\u00b0C washings retained. Target\nDNA was released by incubating the beads in 30 \u00b5L elution buffer\nfor 2 min at 60\u00b0C (70\u00b0C for bio-ASOs with >50% GC content),\nand a final wash was performed at 80\u00b0C. Eluants at 20\u00b0C, 60\u00b0C,\nand 80\u00b0C were stored in 0.2-mL PCR tubes at \u000120\u00b0C. Re-\nextractions were performed by adding bio-ASO to 0.38 \u00b5M to\nunbound DNA and proceeding as above, with an initial 1-min\ndenaturation. Re-enrichments were similarly performed, after\nadding DEB, bio-ASO, and competitor ASO to recovered target\nDNA, as above with a 1-min denaturation.\nAnalysis of Fractionated DNA\nLong PCR analyses of enriched fractions using Taq plus Pfu poly-\nmerases were performed as described (Jeffreys et al. 1998b). The\nsperm recombination analysis (Fig. 5) involved a primary allele-\nspecific PCR at 96\u00b0C for 20 sec followed by 22 cycles at 96\u00b0C for\n20 sec and 65\u00b0C for 7.5 min. Products were diluted 20-fold with\nwater, and 0.5 \u00b5L was used to seed a 15 \u00b5L secondary PCR which\nwas cycled at 96\u00b0C for 1 min followed by 36 cycles at 96\u00b0C for 20\nsec, 59\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 63\u00b0C for 8 min. Secondary PCR products\nwere analyzed by dot-blot hybridization with ASOs as described\n(Jeffreys et al. 2000).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work is the subject of a UK Patent Application.
