Agitation, a cluster of \nrelated symptoms that includes anxiety, irritabil-\nity, and motor restlessness, leading to behaviors \nsuch as pacing, wandering, shouting, and aggres-\nsion,1 is seen in 24% of people with Alzheimer\u2019s \ndisease who live in the community2 and in 48% of \nthose living in residential care facilities.3 Behavior-\nal and psychological symptoms in Alzheimer\u2019s dis-\nease are distressing to caregivers4,5 and often pre-\ncipitate the transition to residential care.6 Atypical \nneuroleptic agents remain the mainstay of drug \ntreatment despite only modest short-term effica-\ncy7,8 and serious side effects, including stroke and \ndeath.9\nTrial data suggest a reduced emergence of be-\nhavioral and psychiatric symptoms in patients \ntreated with cholinesterase inhibitors10; these data \nalso suggest improvements in scores on the Neu-\nropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)11 in patients with \nbehavioral disturbances who continue treatment \nas compared with those in whom treatment is \nwithdrawn.12 A systematic review and meta-analy-\nsis13 concluded that cholinesterase inhibitors have \nmodest beneficial effects on neuropsychiatric \nsymptoms, with a reduction of 1.72 points (95% \nconfidence interval [CI], 0.087 to 2.57) on the NPI \n(on a scale of 1 to 144, with lower scores indicat-\ning less frequent or severe symptoms). A Cochrane \nreview14 concluded that treatment was associated \nwith a reduction of 2.44 points (95% CI, 0.76 to \n4.12). A post hoc analysis of pooled behavioral \ndata from three large galantamine trials showed \nmodest but significant improvements in the total \nNPI score and in the subscales for agitation or ag-\ngression, anxiety, disinhibition, and aberrant mo-\ntor behavior.15 Finally, a small study reported a \nnonsignificant advantage of rivastigmine over pla-\ncebo with respect to the score on the Cohen\u2013Mans-\nfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI).16,17\nClinical uncertainty persists regarding the ef-\nficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors when behav-\nioral disturbance is severe and is the indication \nfor treatment. We conducted a study to assess the \neffect of 12 weeks of treatment with donepezil \n(Aricept, Janssen) on clinically significant agita-\ntion in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Because \nbest practice involves an initial trial of a non-\npharmacologic approach1 and previous studies \nhave shown a rate of response to placebo in excess \nof 40%,18 we enrolled only those patients whose \nagitation was so severe that it was clinically neces-\nsary for them to receive drug treatment and whose \nagitation failed to respond to a 4-week psycho-\nsocial treatment. The primary question was wheth-\ner donepezil is better than placebo in the man-\nagement of agitation that is inappropriate for, or \nhas not responded to, a psychosocial treatment.\nMe thods\nThe original study was a multicenter, blinded, ran-\ndomized, parallel-group trial in which patients \nwere assigned to receive risperidone (Rispendal, \nEisai), donepezil, or placebo for 12 weeks, after \n4 weeks of psychosocial treatment. The target sam-\nple size was 285 people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \nRecruitment started in November 2003 but was \nsuspended in March 2004, following the recom-\nmendation by the United Kingdom Committee for \nSafety of Medicines that risperidone and olanzapine \nnot be used for the treatment of behavioral symp-\ntoms in dementia.19 The trial was restarted in July \n2004 with a two-group design (donepezil and pla-\ncebo), and recruitment ended in September 2005.\nParticipants\nPatients were recruited at eight clinical centers in \nEngland. They were eligible for inclusion if they \nmet the diagnostic criteria of the National Insti-\ntute of Neurological and Communication Disor-\nders and Stroke\u2013Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Related \nDisorders Association20 for probable or possible \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease; had clinical agitation (caus-\ning distress to the patient and at least moderate \nmanagement problems for caregivers on at least \n2 days per week for a 2-week period, together with \na CMAI16 score of 39 or more, on a scale from 29 \nto 203, with higher scores indicating more frequent \nor severe agitation); were older than 39 years of age; \nlived in a residential care facility or with a care-\ngiver in the community; were not receiving neu-\nroleptic agents or cholinesterase inhibitors at the \ntime of enrollment, had not received them in the \nprevious 4 weeks, and were not being considered \nfor such treatment for the next 16 weeks; had the \ncapacity and were willing to consent to participa-\ntion in the study or lacked the capacity and assented \nto participation; and had a caregiver who was in \nagreement with the patient\u2019s assent to participate. \nThe New England Journal of Medicine \nDownloaded from nejm.org at UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER on December 7, 2015.

Exclusion criteria were a \nknown sensitivity to donepezil; severe, unstable, \nor uncontrolled medical conditions; delirium; de-\nmentia with Lewy bodies21; and evidence of poor \ncompliance with prescribed medication.\nInterventions\nBefore randomization, patients participated in a \npsychosocial treatment program for up to 4 weeks, \nconsisting of four sessions (two in person and two \nconducted by telephone) during which the main \ncaregiver was trained to deliver one of three treat-\nment options \u2014 standardized social interaction, \npersonalized music, or removal of triggers for agi-\ntated behaviors22 \u2014 selected on the basis of an as-\nsessment during the first session. Patients whose \nCMAI score was 39 or more after the psychosocial \ntreatment were enrolled in the drug-treatment \nphase of the study and randomly assigned to re-\nceive donepezil or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Pa-\ntients whose agitation was considered sufficiently \nsevere to merit immediate drug treatment could \nenter the randomized phase immediately, and \nthose who started psychosocial treatment but \nwhose agitation was judged clinically not to have \nresponded could enter the randomized phase be-\nfore completion of psychosocial treatment.\nTrial medication was encapsulated. Clinicians, \nthose administering the trial medication, patients, \ncaregivers, and outcome assessors were all un-\naware of the treatment assignments. During weeks \n1 through 4 of the trial, patients received one cap-\nsule (5 mg of donepezil or placebo) daily. During \nweeks 5 through 12, patients received two capsules \n(10 mg of donepezil or placebo) daily. At the end \nof week 12, decisions about treatment of agitation \nwere the responsibility of the referring physician. \nOutcome Measures\nThe total CMAI score at 12 weeks was designated \nas the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes in-\ncluded the caregiver\u2019s assessments of symptoms \nwith the NPI,11 either the NPI Nursing Home Ver-\nsion23 or the NPI Caregiver Distress Scale (depend-\ning on whether the patient was living in a nursing \nhome or at home),24 and cognitive function as mea-\nsured with the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB),25 \nthe Standardized Mini\u2013Mental State Examination \n(SMMSE),26 and the Clinician\u2019s Global Impression \nof Change (CGIC).27\nOutcomes assessors were psychologists or reg-\nistered nurses who attended a week-long training \ncourse designed to familiarize them with the in-\nstruments and standardize delivery. To assess the \nadequacy and consistency of delivery of the psycho-\nsocial treatment, 10% of the sessions were video-\ntaped and rated.\nEvaluations\nThere were four assessment points. Before psycho-\nsocial treatment, consent was obtained, and the \nCMAI, SMMSE, and NPI Caregiver Distress Scale \nwere administered. Before enrollment in the drug \ntrial, the CMAI, NPI, and SMMSE were adminis-\ntered; those patients with CMAI scores of 39 or \nhigher were enrolled in the trial and underwent \nrandomization, and the SIB, CGIC, and NPI Care-\ngiver Distress Scale were administered. At week 4 \n(the time of dose escalation), the CMAI, NPI, and \nNPI Caregiver Distress Scale were administered. \nAt week 12 (the end of the trial), the CMAI, NPI, \nSMMSE, SIB, CGIC, and NPI Caregiver Distress \nScale were administered.\nAdverse events were reported immediately to \nlocal principal investigators, who decided whether \nthe assigned treatment should be revealed or the \npatient removed from the trial. Written report \nforms were faxed to the central trial office and \nsubmitted monthly to the chair of the Data Moni-\ntoring and Ethics Committee.\nRandomization\nTelephone randomization was performed centrally \nby the Medical Research Council (MRC) Clinical \nTrials Unit. Assignment of treatment to drug-pack \nnumbers was performed with the use of a random \nsequence of numbers (fixed blocks of six). The list \nof treatment assignments was checked and ap-\nproved by trial statisticians.\nThe data manager determined treatment as-\nsignments using a fully blind minimization algo-\nrithm containing an embedded list of pack num-\nbers with corresponding treatment. The first 20 \npatients were assigned by means of simple ran-\ndomization with the use of a prepared list. For the \nrest of the patients, a minimization method was \nused to balance treatment assignments according \nto four stratifying factors: participating center, \nage (40 to 59 years, 60 to 74 years, or \u226575 years), \nThe New England Journal of Medicine \nDownloaded from nejm.org at UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER on December 7, 2015.

As with the SIB, the proportion of pa-\ntients fully able to complete the examination was \nlow (44% in both groups).\nSensitivity Analyses\nResults for the CMAI, NPI, NPI Caregiver Distress \nScale, SIB, and SMMSE proved robust with differ-\nent assumptions about departures from random-\nization policies and various other ways of handling \nmissing data (see the Supplementary Appendix). \nFor the CMAI, the results of the repeated-measures \nmodel (a linear mixed-effect model incorporating \ndata from all four assessment points) were slight-\nly in favor of the donepezil group (0.29; 95% CI, \n\u22123.66 to 4.23) but were consistent with the re-\nsults of the adjusted ANCOVA model (Table 2).\nAdverse Events\nAdverse events were similar in the donepezil and \nplacebo groups. Details of all reported adverse \nevents are shown in Table 3.\nDiscussion\nThis 12-week trial examined the effectiveness of \ndonepezil for the treatment of clinically signifi-\ncant agitation in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \nNo significant treatment advantage was shown for \ndonepezil as compared with placebo. The primary \nanalysis, which was adjusted for baseline symp-\ntom severity, showed an estimated difference in the \nchange from baseline of less than 0.1 point on \nthe CMAI between the placebo and intervention \ngroups. The confidence interval for the difference \nsuggests that the study excluded a benefit of 4.5 \npoints or more on a scale ranging from 29 to 203.\nAlthough previous trials have indicated that \ncholinesterase-inhibitor therapy results in modest \nbut significant improvement in the overall sever-\nity of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with \nmild levels of behavioral disturbance, this may be \nexplained by improvements in symptoms other \nthan agitation. For example, a study that examined \nindividual items on the NPI in patients with Alz-\nheimer\u2019s disease showed significant benefits for \nmood-related symptoms but not for agitation.28 \nFurthermore, in a trial in which rivastigmine was \nshown to have efficacy in the treatment of apathy, \ndelusions, and hallucinations in patients who had \ndementia with Lewy bodies, there was no effect \non the NPI measure for agitation.29\nLike other studies examining the use of done-\npezil in the treatment of patients with severe \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease,30,31 our trial showed that \non cognitive measures assessed by the SIB and \nSMMSE, there was a modest benefit from donep-\nezil as compared with placebo.\nThe trial was conducted in a pragmatic manner, \nand the inclusion criteria were broad. Most of the \npatients in the study were nursing home residents \nwith severe dementia and were thus representative \nof patients who present with difficult-to-manage \nbehaviors, such as agitation. We chose agitation \nmeasured by the CMAI as the primary outcome \nbecause we believe this measure captures those \nbehaviors that are most likely to lead to requests \nfor drug treatment. However, agitation may not \nrepresent a homogenous clinical phenomenon, \nand this is a potential limitation of the trial. The \ngeneralizability of our findings is limited by the \nhigh proportion of women in our study and by the \n35% of participants who did not proceed to ran-\ndomization for a number of reasons, including \nsuccessful completion of psychosocial treatment.\nThe effectiveness of second-generation antipsy-\nchotic drugs, which have become the mainstay of \ntreatment for psychosis, agitation, and aggression \nin Alzheimer\u2019s disease, has been seriously ques-\ntioned on the basis of the results of the Clinical \nTable 3.
