Although his time in this position has been addressed by several\nstudies,1 the previous thirty years that he spent \u2018mineralizing\u2019 have been virtually ignored. The\nsituation is similar formanyof thewell-knownmineralogists of the eighteenth century and there\nis a lack of studies that address how a mineralogist actually became a mineralogist.2 Using\nWalker\u2019s early career as a guide, this essay seeks to detail the making of an eighteenth-century\nScottish mineralogist. The time frame under examination begins with Walker\u2019s matriculation\nat the University of Edinburgh in 1746 and it ends with his being appointed professor in 1779.\nThe first section demonstrates that Walker\u2019s early mineralogical education at the Medical\nSchool and under William Cullen was closely linked to chemistry. The second section shows\nhow he used chemical characters to classify minerals and to criticize the systems of Linnaeus,\nDa Costa, Wallerius and Cronstedt. Because Walker needed many \u2018fossil \u2019 samples to test the\nviability of his chemical mineralogy, the final section details how he used tours, patrons and\ncorrespondents to build his mineral collection.\n* Department of Philosophy, University of Durham, 50 Old Elvet, Durham, DH1 3HN, UK.\nAcknowledgements: D.

During this time, the word \u2018mineral \u2019 and \u2018fossil \u2019 were used inter-\nchangeably to describe objects that were dug out of the ground. Such a broadly based\ndefinitionmeant that a range of fields like metallurgy, chemistry, georgics and pharmacy\ninfluenced mineralogy. As Scotland had no mining academies, mineralogy was actually\ntreated in the materia medica and chemistry course offered in the Medical School \u2013\nparticularly in the lectures of Charles Alston,3 Andrew Plummer and, later, William\nCullen. By themid-1750s, Edinburgh\u2019sMedical School had become one of the best places\nin Britain to learn mineralogy. As many of the professors had studied under Herman\nBoerhaave at the University of Leiden,4 they used experimental chemistry to examine\nbiological processes and to develop new pharmaceuticals.5 The chemical language and\ncharacters used in their experiments exerted a strong influence on the practice of botany\nand mineralogy at the University for the entire century.\nNowhere is the influence of chemistry more clear than in a manuscript written\nsometime after 1795. Entitled Systema Fossilium, it presented Walker\u2019s classification of\n\u2018fossils \u2019 and was based on research that he had conducted over the past fifty years. In its\nintroduction he recounts his early mineralogical education:\nI began to collect Fossils in theYear 1746when attending theNatural PhilosophyClass, andwas\nfirst led to it, by the Perusal of [Robert] Boyle\u2019sWorks, and especially hisTreatise onGems \u2026 [I]\noften traversed the Kings Park, the Sea Shores between Crammond&Musselburgh, and visited\nthe Quarries & Coalleries near Edinburgh, but had not Book at the Time, to direct [me]\nconcerning the Species of Fossils, but Woodward\u2019s Catalogues. After studying the Works of\nBoyle, Becker, Stahl, Boerhaave,& some others, I attendedDr. Plummer\u2019s Course of Chymistry\nin the Year 1749, and became still fonder of Mineralogy.6\nThis quotation shows that Walker\u2019s first taste of mineralogy was inspired by the natural\nphilosophy course taught by Robert Steuart (1675\u20131747) in 1746.7 This led him to read\n3 For instance, see Alston\u2019s Lectures on theMateria Medica Containing the Natural History of Drugs, their\nVirtues and Doses: also Directions for the Study of the Materia Medica; and an Appendix on the Method of\nPrescribing\/Published from the Manuscript of the Late Dr. Charles Alston \u2026 by John Hope, London, 1770.\n4 These men are treated in E.

The introduction to this manuscript (which contains the above quotation)\nwas republished over twenty years later as \u2018Notice of mineralogical journeys, and of a mineralogical system,\nby the late Rev. Dr. John Walker, Professor of Natural History in the University of Edinburgh\u2019, Edinburgh\nPhilosophical Journal (1822), 6, 88\u201395.\n7 This is the same Robert Steuart (also spelled Stewart) who taught David Hume and who founded \u2018The\nPhysiological Library\u2019. See M. Barfoot, \u2018Hume and the culture of science in the early 18th century\u2019, in Studies\nin the Philosophy of the Scottish Enlightenment (ed. M. A. Stewart), Oxford, 1990, 151\u201390.\n412 M. D. Eddy\nRobert Boyle\u2019s collectedworks (which included his treatise on gems),8 JohnWoodward\u2019s\nAn Attempt Towards a Natural History of Fossils of England,9 John Becher\u2019s Physica\nSubterranea,10 George Stahl\u2019s Philosophical Principles of Universal Chemistry,11 and\nHerman Boerhaave\u2019s Elements of Chemistry.12 Save for Woodward, all of these books\nwerewritten by chemists.Having read these sources,Walker then attended the lectures of\nAndrewPlummer (d. 1756), the professor of chemistry in theMedical School. In addition\nto attending Plummer\u2019s lectures, it is quite possible that he also attended the materia\nmedica course of Charles Alston (1683\u20131760).13 Yet, aside from teaching Walker the\nbasics of chemistry and natural philosophy, there is no convincing evidence that\nPlummer, Alston or Steuart had any significant influence on his early mineralogy.\nBased on Walker\u2019s comments in his Systema Fossilium and on several other extant\nmanuscripts from early in his career (to be discussed in the next section), it can be seen\nthat his initial conception ofmineralogywas shaped bywhat he read in the bookswritten\nby Boyle, Woodward, Becher, Stahl and, to an extent, Boerhaave. However, the min-\neralogical classification promoted by these chemists or mineralogists was inconsistent.\nSince chemical nomenclature and vocabulary were not standardized until the end of the\neighteenth century,14 each of these authors had a slightly different approach to miner-\nalogy. For instance, Stahl based his systemon chemical characters,whileWoodwardonly\nused chemistry when physical characters were not enough. To make matters even more\nconfusing, there were three different approaches to chemical classification being em-\nployed: (1) Aristotelian Elements (earth, water, fire and air), (2) Paracelsian Tria Prima\n(sulphur, mercury and salts) and (3) the five-principle system (salts, inflammables, water,\nearths and metals). Despite these different forms of chemistry, Walker\u2019s sources listed\nabove do agree on the general assumption that the concept of an \u2018earth\u2019 is central to any\ncredible mineralogical arrangement.\nDuring Walker\u2019s student years, there were generally two different conceptions of the\nword \u2018earth\u2019 (or terra). The first referred to the matter traditionally associated with\nthe word \u2018soil \u2019. I shall use the lower-case form of \u2018earth\u2019 to connote this meaning. The\nsecond conception of earthwasmore philosophical. It referred to the one of four primary\nsubstances that made up all rocks and stones.

Dr John Walker 413\nEarth(s) \u2019 \u2013 to represent this definition.15 (Likewise, I shall use the capitalized version of\n\u2018Salt \u2019 to connote bodies that \u2018are sapid, miscible with water, and not inflammable\u2019).16\nThe idea that one Primary Earth could form the base of all minerals appealed to many\nmineralogists during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Its intellectual lineage\nstretched back to Platonic \u2018forms\u2019 and the four Aristotelian elements. During the six-\nteenth century, chemists held that all matter was somehow born from a Universal Acid\nand itwas this concept thatwas eventually transformed into the eighteenth century\u2019s idea\nof a \u2018universal \u2019 Primary Earth.17\nOf the six authors above, only Becher and Stahl place a strong emphasis on the role\nplayed by Primary Earths in the classification of minerals. The others are either sceptical\nor unclear on thematter. For instance Boyle, in his works on earths, minerals andmetals,\nwas more concerned with ascertaining practical applications. To achieve this goal, he\nlooked at both physical and chemical characters. Yet, even though he was a chemist, he\ndoubted the existence of a Primary Earth:\nHence we may reasonably doubt, whether the assertors of elementary earth can shew us any\nnative substance deserving of that name; and, also whether what remains, after chymical\nanalysis, tho\u2019 it has all the qualities, judg\u2019d sufficient to denominate a portion of matter earth,\nmay not yet be either a compounded body, or endowed with the qualities which belong not to\nsimple earth.18\nWoodward shared Boyle\u2019s pragmatic view. He concentrated solely on physical charac-\nteristics, that is, the \u2018Nature\u2019, \u2018Properties \u2019 and \u2018Phenomena\u2019 of minerals.19 For every\nfossil, wherever possible, he observed its placement in the ground and \u2018the Bulk, the\nForm, theTexture, theConstitution, the Purity orMixtures discernible in it \u2019.20This being\nthe case, his work offers a vague definition of what he means by the word \u2018earth\u2019. For\nhim, anything in the ground that was not a mineral or a metal received this title.21\nLikewise, Boerhaave was not interested in strictly defining this term in Elements (even if\nhe was, his vacillation between Aristotelian, Paracelsian and five-principle chemistry\nwould have muddled the definition anyway).\nWoodward\u2019s and Boyle\u2019s emphasis upon physical characters proved to be very useful\nfor Walker throughout his entire career. In fact, Woodward remained a reference work\nthat Walker recommended to his students after he became Edinburgh Professor of\n15 David Oldroyd treats these two different definitions of earth in \u2018Some phlogistic mineralogical schemes,\nillustrative of the evolution of the concept of \u2018\u2018Earth\u2019\u2019 in the 17th and 18thCenturies\u2019,Annals of Science (1974),\n31, 269\u2013306.\n16 This definition was offered countless times in William Cullen\u2019s lectures and was even used by William\nWithering in his translation of Tobern Bergman\u2019sOutlines ofMineralogy, Birmingham, 1783, \u00b720.

(9), pp. x\u2013xi.\n21 Woodward, however, does state that he believed that the composition of \u2018earth\u2019 remained relatively\nconstant \u2013 even if it was moved about by a flood.

However, the prominent role played by Primary Earths in\nWalker\u2019s Systema Fossilium demonstrates that it was Becher and Stahl who laid the\nconceptual foundations for his chemical approach to the composition of rocks and\nstones.22 Becher held that there were three kinds of Earth: Vitrescible, Fatty and Mer-\ncurial.23 Because he was not able to isolate completely each element of this tria prima,\neach remained a philosophical construct similar to a Platonic \u2018form\u2019. The purest rep-\nresentation of Vitrescible Earth was associated with quartz and was characteristically\ndry. It was the primary ingredient of stones and minerals and imparted the qualities of\nfusibility, solidity and opacity.\nBy the time Walker started attending the University of Edinburgh, the five-principle\nsystem of chemistry had become quite influential in the Medical School. By the mid-\n1750s, Cullen included all of the Primary Earths under the term \u2018Earth Principle\u2019.24 In\nthe years that immediately followed his time at the University of Edinburgh, Walker\neventually decided that Vitrescible Earth was one of five Primary Earths associated with\nthe Earth Principle. However, he never ceased to believe that it was the oldest of all the\nPrimary Earths. Such a view slightly differed from Becher, who held that there was a\nfoundational Primary Earth (Fatty Earth) which served as the base for all Earths and\nwhich conferred colour, taste and odour.25 Like Becher, Stahl maintained the tria prima\nstance, and it was this conception of \u2018Earths\u2019 that was given the title \u2018primitive Earths \u2019\nin Peter Shaw\u2019s widely read English translation of Stahl\u2019s Philosophical Principles of\nUniversal Chemistry.26 Because Stahl accepted many of Becher\u2019s chemical definitions,27\ntheir works are sometimes collectively called the Becher\u2013Stahl School.28 The influence of\nthis school upon seventeenth- and eighteenth-century chemical mineralogists was quite\nsignificant.29 In Edinburgh, its influence was felt in the articles printed in Essays and\nObservations, Physical and Literary, the principal journal of the Medical School and\nEdinburgh Philosophical Society from the 1750s until the 1770s. The Becher\u2013Stahl\nSchool also influenced Cullen, Walker\u2019s chief mentor. Even after its chemistry was\neclipsed at the end of the century, Walker still referred to the phlogiston theory in his\ngeology and mineralogy lectures.30 He never ceased to maintain that the \u2018first persons\n22 For more on Walker\u2019s later conception of Primary Earths, see Eddy, op. cit.

Around 1753 or 1754, he made two marl and (mineral)\nmanure collections and submitted them to the Edinburgh Philosophical Society. He was\nawarded medals for both collections and it was this recognition that first made him\nknown toWilliamCullen and possibly to LordKames. AlthoughCullen lived inGlasgow\nuntil 1755, he had been a member of the Society since 1749 and was \u2018more and more\nattached to Mineralogy, which was at that Time indeed, his own favourite Pursuit \u2019.32\nWalker and Cullen struck up a friendship andWalker began to study chemistry with him\nsoon thereafter. A close bond formed between them and Walker\u2019s writings from the\n1750s demonstrate that he based most of his chemistry upon Cullen\u2019s teachings.33 In-\nfluenced by the Becher\u2013Stahl School, Boerhaave and Pierre Joseph Macquer,34 Cullen\nemployed the five-principle chemical system. During the 1750s, Cullen spent a great deal\nof time trying to develop a systematic arrangement for Salts. He also performed\nexperiments that allowed him to aver that the Earth Principle was \u2018not soluble in water,\nnot inflammable, of a dry & solid consistence, either not fusible in the fire or if fusible\nconcreting again in the form of glass\u2019.35 After reading Johann Heinrich Pott\u2019s Litho-\nge\u00b4onosie36 sometime during the mid-1750s, Cullen became convinced that there were\nfour genera of Primary Earths:37\n1.

These are clearly stated in the \u2018Pharmaceutic\u00e6Cullini\u2019 section of\nBlack\u2019s 1767\/8 chemistry lecture notes. Cochrane, op. cit. (35), 26\u20138.\n416 M. D. Eddy\nIn the Cullen Collection housed in the University of Glasgow Special Collections\nDepartment, there are numerous copies of Cullen\u2019s manuscript notes that he used to give\nas his lectures during the 1750s. Though illegible in several cases, these clearly define his\nconception of the four Primary Earths.He held thatVitrescibleEarths quickly changed to\nglass, became readily transparent with the application of fire, struck fire with steel, were\nlittle altered by calcinations and were not dissolved by acids. Because of their glass-like\ntransparency, he often referred to them as \u2018crystalline\u2019. Within this genus he included\ngems, flint, calculi, sands, quartz and fusible spar (probably feldspar).38Calcarious Earth\ncould either be burnt to quicklime or dissolved with effervescence in acid menstruums.\nIt included marble, limestone, chalk, spars, stalactites, shells, marls, magnesia alba,\naluminous earth, quicklime and earths that contained animal and vegetable matter.39\nArgillaceous Earth, on account of its \u2018viscidity& fineness\u2019, was not dissolvable by acids,\ncould be turned upon a lathe and became harder andmore compactwhen exposed to fire.\nThis genus contained white clay, coloured clays, steatites and ferruginea.40 Talky Earth\nwas less well defined because Cullen could not decide whether or not it included Gyp-\nseous Earth. This fluctuating genus contained selenicks and gypsum. Upon being burned,\nthese fossils \u2018changed into a gypsum or Such a kind of Quicklime as is dissolved in kinds\nof Acids& is the longest resisting vitrification\u2019.41 Based on Cullen\u2019s observations, Joseph\nBlack would later decide that Talky Earth and Gypseous Earth both formed their own\nseparate genus.\nAside from a few physical qualities like transparency and malleability, Cullen\u2019s pre-\nvailing method for determining Primary Earths was chemical.More specifically, his tests\nemployed \u2018Fire \u2019 and \u2018Chemical Menstrua\u2019. Cullen\u2019s usage of \u2018Fire \u2019 generally meant\n\u2018heat \u2019. Or, as he stated, \u2018 the presence of Fire \u2019 can vulgarly be judged by the presence of\n\u2018Heat & Light\u2019.42 \u2018Chemical Menstrua\u2019 referred to humid forms of analysis (aqueous\nsolutions) that were governed by the Salt Principle (which Cullen also called the Doc-\ntrine of Salts).43 During his time as Walker\u2019s teacher, his use of heat had convinced him\nthat all Primary Earths might be reduced to \u2018a transparent vitrious body\u2019. Echoing the\nBecher\u2013Stahl School, Cullen felt that this suggested the \u2018possibility of the universal\nclarification of our opaque terrene Globe\u2019.44 This excited him because such a Primary\n(Vitrescible) Earth could serve as the base for a standardized mineralogical system. Yet\nCullen could not actively argue for the explicit existence of such a Primary Earth because\nthe only way to reduce Calcareous, Gypseous and Argillaceous Earths into a vitrescible\n38 For more on Cullen\u2019s chemical conception of Vitrescible Earths, see \u2018Of vitrescent earths and vitrifi-\ncations \u2026 by Cullen\u2019, GUL MS Cullen 268\/8.\n39 The following definition of the four Earths are taken fromWilliam Cullen, \u2018A chemical examination of\ncommon simple stones& earths \u2026 byWilliamCullen withNotes [Incomplete] on alkali earths and the Earth\u2019s\nstructure\u2019, GUL MS Cullen 264, f. 1.\n40 Cullen, op. cit.

Donovan\u2019s Philosophical Chemistry: The\nDoctrines and Discoveries of William Cullen and Joseph Black, Edinburgh, 1975.\n44 GUL MS Cullen, op. cit. (35), f. 1.\nThe \u2018 ingenious \u2019 Rev. Dr John Walker 417\nstate was by adding saline mixtures.45 The presence of these Salts made it hard to\ndetermine whether or not the original Earth under examination was truly vitrifiable.\nEven so, Cullen\u2019s acceptance of the Primary Earths allowed him to hold that all rocks\nwere \u2018nothing else but Earths baked firmly together \u2019.46 As such, they could be reduced\nback to their constituent Earths if pulverized. For this reason, he was more concerned\nwith chemical experiments that tested for the presence of Primary Earths.\nIn addition to identifying a stone\u2019s Primary Earths, Cullen\u2019s chemistry lectures also\ntreated another importantmineralogical topic : earth.He defined this as \u2018powdery bodies\ndiffusible in Water\u2019.47 With this definition, it seems that Cullen was trying to portray\nearth as a makeshift species that fell between Primary Earths and Salts. However, such a\nbroad definitionwas notwithout its problems andCullen spent a good deal of time trying\nto iron out the conceptual wrinkles. It seems that Walker was involved in this process\nbecause he published an article in the 1757 edition of the Philosophical Transactions\nwhich addressed the shared characters of saline and terrene mineral water solutions.48 In\ngeneral, Cullen held that there were two types of earth. The first was \u2018ofmoist surfaces&\nviscid\u2019. These consisted of marls and of clays. He sometimes placed stipulations on these\nsubstances. He held that marls should effervesce in acid and should not harden in fire.\nClays should harden in fire and be soluble in acids. The second type of earth was \u2018of dry\nsurfaces and friable \u2019. These consisted of ochres and \u2018tripelas\u2019.49He sometimes stipulated\nthat the ochres should be \u2018soft and smooth\u2019 and the tripelas should be \u2018hard and rough\u2019.\nCullen\u2019s interest did not stop at Primary Earths and earths. He even offered a basic\nclassification system for stones. He held that they consisted of two types: Powdery and\nSolid. Powdery Stones, or rather those \u2018In coarse powder\u2019,50 consisted of sand, grit and\nearth fragments. Solid Stones, or those \u2018In larger Masses \u2019,51 consisted of two general\ndivisions: Simple and Structured. Since Cullen thought that stones were composed of a\nmixture of Primary Earths and earths, his classifications are quite rough and sometimes\noverlap. Simple Stones included gypseous stone, freestone, limestone, rockstone and\n(curiously) granite. The description he offers for \u2018Structured\u2019 stones in his manuscript\nnotes is vague and seems to be directed at the concreted matter surrounding rocks. He\noffers four types: Determined, Milky, Coloured and Clear. Sprinkled throughout his\nentire classification of stones are also chemical characters which are usually determined\nby experiments involving acid. Thus Cullen oscillates between physical and chemical\n45 Saline experimentation was arguably a leading form of humid analysis in both Scotland and France\nduring the early to mid-eighteenth century. For the French scene, see Frederic L. Holmes, \u2018Analysis by fire and\nsolvent extractions: the metamorphosis of a tradition\u2019, Isis (1971), 62, 129\u201348.\n46 Cullen, op. cit.

The physical characters that he particularly liked were\nsoftness, hardness, smoothness, colour and stratigraphical alignment.\nIn addition to mineralogy, Cullen\u2019s chemistry was relevant to both medicine and\nnatural history. Such a link was not new in Britain. For instance, in addition to em-\nphasizing the value of applying chemistry to all the kingdoms of nature, Boyle\u2019s com-\nments on the actual practice of natural history served as a guide for many naturalists.52\nLikewise, Cullen\u2019s lectures make the link between natural history and chemistry quite\nclear :\nNatural History is what acquaints with the native place[,] & the Sevl appearances of all the\nSubjects of Art or Commerce[,] it must appear to deserve particular attention & that it is\nChemistry that teaches the variousmanufacture of these for the purposes of Life[.] Both together\nmay be considered as important to Society[.] They are necessarily connected together[.] The\nchemist will often blunder if He cannot distinguish Natural Productions & at the same time\nThe Naturalist will not be able properly to distinguish the Sevl Similar productions of Nature\nwithout the Assistance of Chemical Expts [.]53\nBased on this rationale, Cullen kept his own mineralogical collection, which Walker\npurchased for the Edinburgh Natural History Museum in the 1790s.54 Cullen also en-\ncouraged his other students to do the same, as can be seen by the fact that Black was also\ninterested in collecting minerals.55 Cullen\u2019s above lecture on this topic goes on to direct\nhis students to examine minerals because the\nEarth of every Country contains in its Bowels a variety of ValuableMatters that are neglected&\nundiscerned[.] Arts are often at a loss for matter[ial]s & we often import[.] This Country has\nbeen so little examined that probably many treasures are reserved to the discovery of Skilfull\npersons[.]\nHe then proceeds to give a long list of minerals worth investigating in Scotland. Walker\ntook this list quite seriously because he made it a point to examine many of its items\nduring the next two decades.56This allowed him to acquire the specimens that eventually\nbecame part of the University of Edinburgh\u2019s Natural HistoryMuseum.57 In this manner,\nchemistry and mineralogy were mutually dependant. Chemistry provided characters by\n52 Robert Boyle,General Heads for theNatural History of a CountryGreat or Small, London, 1692.

Dr John Walker 419\nwhich rocks could be classified \u2013 first into genera based on Primary Earths and then into\nclasses. These characters were not only used for arranging minerals. They were also\nemployed in the making of pharmaceuticals and in the purification of mineral ores. The\nlatter was linked to mining and could therefore be used to obtain patronage. This is why\nWalker\u2019s contemporary Black analysed box after box of minerals sent to him by Lord\nHopetoun and other naturalists during the 1770s.58 In addition to analysing mineral\nores, chemistry was incorporated into the larger utilitarian enterprise of agricultural\nimprovement. This is why the Philosophical Society was interested in Walker\u2019s 1753\nto 1754 marl collections. Following this pattern, Walker continued to promote the\ninteraction of chemistry and natural history throughout his career and,59 like Cullen,\ngave a public lecture on the topic in 1788.60\nChemistry and classification (I) : Walker\u2019s early attempts at arrangement\nCullen\u2019s combination of chemistry and natural history had a profound effect onWalker.\nThe first printed indication of this effect was in his 1757 Philosophical Transactions\narticle on mineral water.61 Walker maintained his interest in chemistry over the next ten\nyears as he toured Scotland. As these travels were extensive, they will be treated in the\nnext section. The main goal of the present section is to detail his nascent classification\nsystem. The manuscript sources on this topic for the period between 1757 and 1766 are\nfew. Of those that are extant, there is no clear indication as to which mineralogical\nclassification influencedWalker\u2019s early investigations. Even though the 1761 index of his\nlibrary shows what he was reading,62 it does not indicate his personal definition of a\nPrimary Earth, nor does it specifically identify his classificatory preference.His index also\ndoes not list several books that were published before 1761, but that proved to be quite\ninfluential to Walker\u2019s mineralogy in the mid-1760s \u2013 a good example being Linnaeus\u2019s\nSystemaNatur\u00e6. The 1771 report that he compiled for his 1764Hebrides andHighlands\ntour offers a similarly murky picture. Since it is quite likely that he interpolated several\nauthors into the text, it is difficult to determine which books he was actually using in\n1764.63\n58 EUL Black MS 873\u20135.

Margaret M. McKay), Edinburgh, 1980.\n420 M. D. Eddy\nThe first clear indication as to which classification system was guiding his initial\nmineralogical activity is found in a notebook of natural history commonplaces entitled\nAdversaria.64 Kept from 1766 to around 1772, it is a collection of aphorisms, ob-\nservations and thoughts drawn from personal observation, books, articles and con-\nversations.65 Much of this information would eventually be included in the natural\nhistory lectures and articles that he wrote after he became a professor in 1779. Since the\nfirst entry is numbered \u2018300\u2019, it is likely thatAdversaria is the only remaining example of\na set of several notebooks. Even though it contains observations on all three kingdoms\nof nature, it focuses chiefly upon mineralogy and botany. The mineralogical entries\nare helpful for two reasons. First, they include the half dozen or so authors who most\ninfluenced Walker at this time (sometimes specific books and page numbers are cited).\nSecond, there are several lists of minerals that were either collected by him or by other\nnaturalists. In entry 335, he lists general directions on how a beginnermight group newly\ncollected Fossils :\na. Gems. Crystals. Agates. Pebbles. Jaspers. Granites. Porphyries. Free stone. Whet-\nstone. Touchstone.\nb. Marbles. Limestone. Flints. Spars. Chalk. Alabaster. Stalactites. Petrifactions.\nc. Talc. Slate. Asbestos.\nd. Salts. Vitriols. Selenites.\ne. Amber. Ambergrease. Bitumens. Coal.

Figured fossils, as Entrochi, Belemnites, Asteno, Cornua Ammonites. Glossopetra.\nk. Superficial Delineations of Herbs, Trees, Ruins &tc. upon Stones.66\nIt is hard to know ifWalker based this list on something that he read (either in a book or\nin a letter) or if it was of his own creation. No matter where he got it, the list demon-\nstrates the direct influence of Cullen and chemical mineralogy. Not only is it based\non the five-principle system propounded by Cullen and many of his colleagues in\nEdinburgh\u2019s Medical School (Salts, Inflammables, Metals, Earths and Water),67 but\nits first four categories are directly based on the fourfold division of Primary Earths\n(vitrescible, calcareous, argillaceous and talcy) that Cullen took from Pott. The a group\ncontains stones that are indurated and composed of a high percentage of vitrescible\nEarth. The b group is generally made of calcareous Earth and is semi-hard. The c group\nAugmentations of the sections on Jura and Iona were eventually published in Walker\u2019s Essays, op. cit. (60), as\n\u2018History of the Island of Icolumbkil\u2019, 111\u201399 and \u2018History of the Island of Jura\u2019, 219\u201381.\n64 John Walker, Adversaria (1766\u201372), Bound MS, GUL MS Murray 27.\n65 Adversaria\u2019s semi-aphoristic style in parts is similar to the approach taken by Linnaeus in Philosophica\nBotanica, Stockholm, 1751. Joseph Black was also interested in such a type of personal notation. See Thomas\nThomson, The History of Chemistry Vol. I, London, 1830, 315.\n66 Walker, op. cit. (64), f. 157. The Greek characters are Walker\u2019s. The \u2018Asteno\u2019 fossil in the i class might\npossibly be \u2018Asteria\u2019.\n67 Thiswas also the systemused byBlack (Cullen\u2019s former student) during the 1760s; the only differencewas\nthat he added the sixth category of \u2018Airs\u2019. See Cochrane, op. cit. (35).\nThe \u2018 ingenious \u2019 Rev. Dr John Walker 421\nis soft and contains talcy Earth. The fossils in the f group are composed of various\ningredients characteristic of argillaceous Earth. Walker used Salts, Inflammables and\nMetals to form his next categories. The d group contains Salts or minerals like fluors\nthat had qualities that Walker would have understood to be saline.68 Those placed in the\ne group are either inflammable themselves or are a naturally occurring product of\ninflammables. Finally, the g group was based on Metals.\nOnce Walker had used chemical principles to group metals and minerals, he then\ngrouped the remains of animals or plants found in the ground. Here hemoves beyond the\nrealm of rocks and stones. Since this limited his ability to use chemical characters, he\nreliesmoreon thephysical characters to group suchorganic \u2018Productions\u2019 (groupsh, i,k).\nHowever, despite such a physically based classification, the chemical properties of these\nproductions were still a topic addressed by eighteenth-century chemists. Joseph Black\ndevoted a whole section to the productions of animals and vegetables in his 1767\u20138\nlectures69 andmany of the chemical mineralogists mentioned inWalker\u2019sAdversaria and\nhis 1761 library index included similar categories.70 Thus all of Walker\u2019s early classifi-\ncations were based upon the chemistry of the day. The only chemical element that is not\nincluded in his classification isWater. Technically, however, it was not a fossil and this is\nprobably why it is omitted. Walker did believe that Water was important for mineral\nstudies \u2013 as can be seen in his 1757 Philosophical Transactions article on Hartfell Spa.71\nChemistry and classification (II) : systematic mineralogy sources\nOf the half dozen or so authors mentioned in Adversaria, only Emanuel Mendes Da\nCosta\u2019s ANatural History of Fossils72 and Linnaeus\u2019s Systema Natur\u00e6 receive a notable\namount of attention. Even though each of them based their system on physical charac-\nters, both used chemistry at some point in their classification. However, their systems\nFigure 1.

In addition to his 1757 article, op. cit.\n(48), and the mineral water works in his 1761 Index, there are several manuscript notes from the 1780s that\naddress the topic. See EUL Dc.1.58 f. 2, f. 40, and ff. 90\u201392.\n72 Emanuel Mendes Da Costa, A Natural History of Fossils, London, 1757.\n422 M. D. Eddy\nwere different. Da Costa took issue with Linnaeus\u2019s method73 and had created his own\nclassification which ran in the following order: series, chapter, genus, section and\nmember. As he did not finish his system, there are only two series : Earths and Stones.\nThe chapter, genus and section are formed on physical features (colour, texture and so\non) and the members are differentiated based on their reactions to acids and alkalis.\nLikewise, Linnaeus resorted to chemistry as a final option to be used after physical\ncharacters were exhausted: \u2018The student has three modes of investigating this [Mineral]\nKingdom: Physical, which descends through the obscure generation of minerals :\nNatural, which considers their superficial and visible structure: Chemical, which as-\ncend through their destructive analysis. \u201974 For the last, Linnaeus employed fire and\nacids. He also used several other characters that fell within the realm of eighteenth-\ncentury humid analysis : concretion, cementation, calcination, putrefaction and crys-\ntallization.75 It can be seen that chemistry was used in Da Costa and Linnaeus, but it\nwas relegated to a minor role.\nWalker\u2019s early classification clearly demonstrates that he did not follow such an ap-\nproach. His many references to these authors show his life-long proclivity to cite works\nthat were ordered by taxonomies (or even an epistemology) that he himself did not\nsupport. He had no problemwith extracting examples from one book and then inserting\nthem into a system (usually his own) that seemedmore reasonable.He began this practice\nearly in his career with his use of Becher, Stahl andWoodward and he continued it in his\ngeology lectures where he cites theorists like Buffon and Maupertuis.76 This process of\nextracting and inserting natural history commonplaces was common during the En-\nlightenment. In mineralogy\u2019s case, the sea of sources produced a canon of works from\nwhich examples were most often taken.77 Da Costa, Linnaeus,78 John Hill and Wood-\nward were the standard works cited by British mineralogists.79 However, the difference\nbetween citing them and actually agreeing with them was sometimes quite vast.\nAs Walker\u2019s work demonstrates, it was quite common to praise these canonical\nauthors in one sentence and then criticize them in the next. In general, the preface of\nalmost every systematic mineralogy book was full of attacks upon the shortcomings of\nprevious authors. Da Costa\u2019s History was no exception: \u2018I have attentively examined\n73 G. S. Rousseau andD.

(9).\nThe \u2018 ingenious \u2019 Rev. Dr John Walker 423\nthe Woodwardian and Wallerian systems, and, finding them defective, have presumed\nto form a new one from the principles of both. \u201980 Yet Da Costa was criticized in the\nsame manner by later mineralogists, one of them being Walker himself : \u2018Mr. Da Costa\nhas from Germany the same red micaceous Fossile, which is found at Dalswinton. He\nconsiders it as anOre of Iron, as Linnaeus likewise does, tho\u2019 probably I think with some\nimpropriety. It is the Ferrum intractable nitens micaceum. Lin.[naeus]. \u201981 Sometimes\nthese criticisms became rather pointed and this caused tempers to flare. However, in\nWalker\u2019s case, his fruitful correspondence with Da Costa during the 1760s suggests that\nhe took issue with the system and not with the man.\nWalker\u2019s disagreement with Da Costa and Linnaeus over the classification of the\nferrous\/micaceousmineral in the quotation above is significant because it touches on two\nimportant issues presented by Adversaria. First, it demonstrates Walker\u2019s emerging\nproclivity to use chemical analysis as a means for disagreeing with well-known miner-\nalogical authorities. No doubt his contention with Da Costa and Linnaeus on this point\nwas informed by the \u2018 iron principle \u2019 experiments that he performed on Hartfell Spa in\n1757. Second, in the course of his mineralogical observations, Walker cites Johan\nGottschalk Wallerius (1709\u201385), the eminent professor of chemistry at the University of\nUppsala (1750\u201367).82 During the mid-eighteenth century, Wallerius wrote about a\nnumber of chemically related disciplines, but his most influential mineralogical work in\nBritain was Mine\u00b4ralogie, ou Description Ge\u00b4ne\u00b4rale des Substances du Re`gne Mine\u00b4ral\n(1747).83 Citing this work to clarify the classification of ferrum intractable nitens mi-\ncaceum, Walker writes, \u2018Of this Species Wallerius has 2 Varieties. \u201984 This reference to\nWallerius is notable because it links Walker to Swedish chemical mineralogy at a very\nearly date.\nNot only does he make several references to Wallerius, but Walker also mentions\nWallerius\u2019s disciples Jacques-Christophe Valmont de Bomare (1731\u20131807) and Axel\nFredrik Cronstedt (1722\u201365). Bomare was then \u2018De\u00b4monstateur d\u2019Histoire Naturelle,\nMembre de la Socie\u00b4te\u00b4 Litteraire de Clermont-Ferrand, de l\u2019Acade\u00b4mie royal des Belles-\nLettres de Cae\u00a8n, de l\u2019Acade\u00b4mie royale des Sciences, Belles\u2019Lettres & Beaux-Arts de\nRouen\u2019 and was the author ofMine\u00b4ralogie, ou Nouvelle Exposition du Re`gne Mine\u00b4ral\n(1762).85 Cronstedt\u2019s work on mineralogy had been written in 1758, but had gained a\nwider audience when it was translated into German during 1760.86 The mineralogies of\n80 Da Costa, op. cit.

See Cronsted\u2019s entry in the Dictionary of\nScientific Biography ; D. R. Oldroyd, \u2018A note on the status of A. F. Cronstedt\u2019s simple earths and his analytical\n424 M. D. Eddy\nWallerius, Bomare and Cronstedt all based their systems upon Primary Earths just like\nWalker, Cullen and Black. In fact, it was Cullen himself who had first introducedWalker\nto Cronstedt in 1764:\nNot long before I set out [for the Hebrides], Dr. Cullen had received the first German Edition of\nCronstedt\u2019s Essay, of which hewas so fond, that he carried it for severalWeeks in his Pocket. He\ntranslated to me the leading Characters of Cronstedt\u2019s new & peculiar Classes. He was par-\nticularly anxious about the Zeolite. And it was in consequence of this, that I first observed it,\namong the Basaltick Rocks at the Giants Causeway, though afterwards, in greater Plenty &\nVariety in many of the Islands.87\nBy 1766 Walker was discussing Cronstedt\u2019s chemical mineralogy with the German\nnaturalist F. W. P. Fabricius.88 In Adversaria, Walker takes care to note Cronstedt\u2019s\ncomments on Zeolite, particularly because of its relation to talc: \u2018He [Fabricius] says our\nwhole Canna Fluor is not a Talc, but the Zeolite of Cronstedt, who has found it in the\nsameGenuswith the Lapis Lazuli, because both have this remarkable Property, thatwith\nAqua fortis they dissolve into Gelly. \u201989 Walker\u2019s connection to Swedish chemical min-\neralogy was even further solidified by the fact that Da Costa (Walker\u2019s primary mineral\nsupplier) tradedminerals withWallerius and eventually edited the first English edition of\nCronstedt\u2019s Mineralogy.90 Additionally, several of the minerals in Walker\u2019s collection\ncame from Sweden and Norway. Thus, both directly and indirectly, Walker was able to\nremain informed on Scandinavian chemical mineralogy.91\nBuilding a collection (I) : the mineralogy of travel\nOne of the distinguishing marks of the professors who lectured in Edinburgh\u2019s Medical\nSchool was that they understood the pedagogical effectiveness of passing around natural\nhistory specimens. Students were also encouraged to build their own collection of\nmineralogical and botanical simples and this contributed to an in situ form of naturalism\nmethods\u2019, Isis (1974), 65, 506\u201312; Porter, op. cit.

This is most\nlikely because Werner\u2019s classification was based on physical characters. See Scott\u2019s introduction in op. cit. (1),\npp. xxiv\u2013xxv, xxxvii ; J. M. Sweet and C. D.Waterston, \u2018Robert Jameson\u2019s approach to theWernerian Theory\nof the Earth, 1796\u2019, Annals of Science (1967), 23, 81\u201396, 81\u20133. Walker also does not seem to have utilized\ncrystallographic criteria.\nThe \u2018 ingenious \u2019 Rev. Dr John Walker 425\nthat lasted well into the nineteenth century.92 Apart from building curiosity collections,\nthis seems to have been the leading motivation for collecting minerals in Scotland dur-\ning the mid-eighteenth century.93 As Walker\u2019s biography demonstrates, one of the most\ncommon ways of locating useful minerals in Scotland was travel. During his student\nyears, Walker first explored the Edinburgh area with his friends Edward and Alexander\nWight. He visited quarries, collieries, the King\u2019s Park and the Firth of Forth\u2019s shoreline.\nEven though he mentions these and many other trips in his Systema Fossilium, it is\nsometimes difficult to trace his exact steps because he visited several places more than\nonce and because he did not leave behind any personal diaries. However, his trips can be\ndivided into two overarching categories : short and long tours.Walker used short tours to\nexplore almost the entire mainland of Scotland. They could last from a few days to a few\nmonths. In his early travels (1753 to 1762), he explored areas in Midlothian and South\nLothian, Tweeddale, Moffat and Annandale. From 1753 to 1757 he lived in Galloway\nwhere he toured its moors and dales as well as the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. During\nthese trips he collected the marl and manure samples that attracted the attention of\nCullen and the Philosophical Society. In 1758 Walker went to live in Glencorse (also\nspelled Glencross) and also travelled with Cullen to Breadalbane. During the next three\nyears he toured Fife, the shores of the Tay, Kinnoul Hill, Clackan, Annanshire, the silver\nand cobalt mines of Alva and the copper mine of \u2018Aithoy\u2019.\nIn 1762 Walker moved to Moffat and lived there for the next twenty years. These\nMoffat travels (1762 to 1782) were evenmore extensive. As hewould later state, \u2018During\nmy long Residence in Moffat, I collected in a Number of short tours, all the remarkable\nFossils in Dumfriesshire, the Forest of Selkirk, Teviotdale, Ayrshire, and Clydesdale. \u201994\nAdditionally, he visited the lead mines of Machrymore, Leadhills and Wanlock, the\ncoppermines of Covend and the antimonymines of Eskdale. Hemade over thirty trips to\nLeadhills and Wanlock on account of their close proximity to Moffat. There, between\n1761 and 1764, he observed many minerals (strontite and zeolite in particular) that had\nnot been previously seen in Britain. Walker would later state these \u2018new\u2019 minerals to be:\n\u2018 the Ore, and the Ochre of Nickel ; the Plumbum pellucidum of Linn\u00e6us; the Plumbum\ndecahedrum and cyaneum, both undescribed; the Saxum metalliferum of the Germans;\nthe Ponderosa ae\u00a8rata of Bergman; and theMorettum,which afterwards appeared to be a\nsort of Zeolite \u2019.95 As his comments on Fabricius and Cronstedt indicate, his interest in\n92 The practice of a physician traversing the woods and fields to find materia medica simples reaches back\nto Hippocrates. In 1683 the Scottish geographer Sir Robert Sibbald stated, \u2018As for the Practice of Medicine,\nHippocrates hath abundantly proven, that a Physician must, who would practise alright, first know the place.\u2019\nAn Account of the Scotish Atlas, or the Description of Scotland Ancient and Modern, Edinburgh, 1683, 1\u20132.\nThe link between local naturalism and materia medica in modern times has been treated by D. E. Allen in\n\u2018Walking the swards:medical education and the rise and spread of the botanical field class\u2019, inD. E. Allen (ed.),\nNaturalists and Society: The Culture of Natural History in Britain, 1700\u20131900, Aldershot, 2001, Part I. Also\nsee Chapters 1 and 2 in his The Naturalist in Britain: A Social History, London, 1976.\n93 This seems to shed some light onHughTorrens\u2019s statement that the \u2018question of howmineralswere found\nin the first place, prior to their being uncovered and mined, has been strangely neglected\u2019. \u2018Some thoughts on\nthe complex and forgotten history of mineral exploration\u2019, Journal of the Open University Geological Society\n(1997), 17, 1\u201312.\n94 Walker, Systema Fossilium, op. cit.

Eddy\nzeolite was originally related to talc, that is, a potential Primary Earth. Furthermore, his\nresearch on strontitic \u2018earth\u2019 led to its later chemical classification.96 Other short travels\nduring this Moffat period include a 1765 journey to London97 and his 1778 trips to\nStirlingshire, Perthshire, Forfarshire, the Mearns and Aberdeenshire. Walker moved to\nColinton (near Edinburgh) in 1782 and remained there until he died in 1803. During\nthis time, he was first busy with lecturing and then slowly began to lose his eyesight.\nAs a result, his short trips were limited and he depended more upon the observations\nof students and correspondents.98\nIn addition to his short tours, Walker took two long tours to the Highlands and\nHebrides. The first was in 1764 and the second was in 1771. The 1764 tour covered most\nof the Inner and Outer Hebrides and was more extensive. Both of these trips were dually\nsupported by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and the Board of Annexed\nEstates. For his scientific and his ecclesiastical observations, he was awarded both an\nhonorary MD and DD in 1765.99 Whenever observing minerals, he was keen to record\n\u20181. The Qualities, local Uses, & indigenous Names to be marked\u2019 and \u20182. The most com-\nmon Productions generally neglected\u2019.100 He also noted and\/or collected the following:\n1. [The general chemical divisions of fossils.]101\n2. Specimens of a large Size necessary.\n3. The Want of sufficient Specimens, on Cause of the Imperfection of the natural\nHistory of Fossils.\n4. Valuable Ores long considered as useless.\n5. To collect the most common Rocks, Stones and Earths, especially those which\nprevail over a Country, or any considerable Tract.\n6. The Walls of Vein, the Earths, Ochres & Fluors, as well as the Ores it contains.\n7. To mark the Circumstances of their native Situation.\n8. Whether the Fossile is in the Place where it has been generated.\n9. Proportion of Metal in the Ore \u2013 Size of Disposition of the Veins \u2013 Manner of\nworking the Mines & smelting the Ores.\nEven thoughWalker states these directions to bemore useful for a neophyte traveller, his\nlater writings demonstrate that he followed a similar system when he traversed the wilds\nof Scotland. Like his chemical divisions of minerals, these instructions were probably\nnot original to Walker. In fact, they bear a strong resemblance to the instructions given\n96 \u2018[T]oDr.Walker themerit is due of having determinedmineralogically that Strontites was a newmineral\nspecies. Dr. Hope afterwards, by the discovery of the strontitic earth, added to the interest of the determination\nof Dr. Walker, and proved that strontites was also a new chemical species. \u2019 Walker, \u2018Notice of mineralogical\njourneys\u2019, op. cit.

Concerning the preservation of samples, Walker\nrecommended the following tools and precautions :\n10. Each Specimen to be put up separately & tallied with a Catalogue.\n11. Tender Fossils to be put up in Cotton in Chip Boxes, & these again well wrapt &\ntied up in paper, because the Glue of the Boxes, sometimes gives way. Gems, fine\nSpars & Crystals, Stalactites, Asbestos, Crystals of Salts & Vitriols, Superficial\nDelineations, figured or lucidOres,&most sorts of Petrifactions&figured Fossils\nrequire this Precaution.\n12. The several Parcels to be packed up in Barrels or strong Boxes, with plenty of\nPaper, Cotton, Tow or some such soft Substance.\n13. Iron Cron. Pocket Spade. Hammers. Chip Boxes. Paper of different kinds. Pack\nThread. Cotton. Canvass Bags.102\nUsing these directions,Walkermade observations and collected awide variety of samples\nthat allowed him to write a detailed report on the Hebrides for King George III. This\nreport is now known as the King\u2019s MS. It was based on his 1764 journey and took him\nseven years to write. The preface of the King\u2019s MS is addressed \u2018TO HIS MAJESTIES\nCOMMISSIONERS AT THE BOARDOF ANNEXED ESTATES\u2019103 and it states, \u2018The\nfollowing History of the western Islands, undertaken at your Desire and executed under\nyour patronage, I have endeavoured as much as possible to render subservient to your\nexcellent and Patriotic Designs. \u2019104 As a representative of the Crown\u2019s improving\nlandlords, it was his duty to identify minerals that were of economic value \u2013 lead, coal,\nmarble and metals being the most notable.105\nAt first glance, the plethora of physical observations in the King\u2019s MS might suggest\nthat Walker had forgotten his chemical mineralogy. However, this was not the case. He\ncited chemical mineralogists like Wallerius and Cronstedt because many of the minerals\nhe mentions would have been of great interest to Scottish chemists.106 An excellent\nexample of this is in the section of the report on the Isle of Skye. Here Walker mentions\nthat he has found a Talcy Earth similar to that used for making China in Cornwall.\n\u2018 I have as little doubt, that this Talc of Sky, is superior to the Soap Rock. It is of a most\n102 Walker, op. cit.

One of the goals of the Boardwas to determinewhether or not the land could be economically improved\nand whether or not there was still a strong Catholic presence.\n104 SeeMcKay\u2019s introduction toWalker, op. cit.

Eddy\npure and impalpable Substance, of itself, the most unalterable in the fire perhaps, of\nany Fossile, Gold only excepted. \u2019107 This test upon Talcy Earth served two important\nchemical goals. First, it would have aided Black and Cullen in their deliberations about\nTalc\u2019s status as a Primary Earth. These deliberations were closely related to several\nother experiments Black had conducted over the past decade to determine whether or\nnot other substances like alum and magnesia alba were products of calcareous earth.\nThese types of experiment had been initiated by Andreas Marggraf and Johann Pott\nat the Berlin Academy a decade earlier.108 Second, since the 1750s Cullen had been\nsearching for a Scottish clay that could be used to make porcelain (this was why he had\noriginally consulted Pott). It was for this reason that Walker used his fire experiment to\nargue that the Talc from the Isle of Skye was just as suited for manufacturing china as the\n\u2018apyrous\u2019 clay (kaolin) used from Stourbridge and other places in the EnglishMidlands.\nIn all of his travels from the 1750s to the 1770s, Walker\u2019s chemistry played an\nimportant role in how he actually gathered mineralogical samples. The only way that he\ncould determine whether or not the manure from Kirkcudbright or the Talc from Skye\nwere relevant to other chemicalmineralogistswas to performpreliminary tests in the field\nor at home that would reveal whether or not certain minerals were worth sending to\nEdinburgh for further analysis. This would not have been hard since the two main tests\n(fire and acids) did not involve elaborate apparatus109 (however, it is worth saying that\nWalker does not mention Cronstedt\u2019s blowpipe technique).110 Once the samples were in\nEdinburgh, this allowed him and others to conduct more experiments upon them.\nMoreover, it was these private specimens that would eventually form the core of the\n\u2018public\u2019 mineralogical collection of Edinburgh University\u2019s Natural HistoryMuseum.111\nOver the next thirty years, the chemical characters obtained from such fossils played a\nkey role in the classification system that he taught his natural history students during\nthe 1780s and 1790s.112 Since his classification was based on Primary Earths, the very\ncategories created by each genus and species led him to investigate specific chemical\n107 Emphasis added. Walker, op. cit. (63), 218.\n108 For Alum, the question was whether or not it was an alkaline Calcareous Earth. See Frederic Lawrence\nHolmes, Eighteenth-Century Chemistry as an Investigative Enterprise, Berkeley, 1989, 49\u201355.\n109 Sometimes an acid test could be performedby simply tasting the object under consideration. For instance\nsee his treatment of the South Uist\u2019s polygonum amphibium. Walker, op. cit. (63), 76.\n110 This could be becauseCullen only gaveWalker a partial translationofCronstedt\u2019s classification, thereby\npossibly preventingWalker from knowing about Cronstedt\u2019s blowpipe. The fact thatWalker does not mention\nthe field use of this test confirms (at present) Staffan Mu\u00a8ller-Wille\u2019s belief that the instrument was generally\nconfined to laboratory usage. SeeMu\u00a8ller-Wille\u2019s paper given at the History of Science Society AnnualMeeting\nat Denver, Colorado, Session \u2018The creation of order: scientific classifications in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies\u2019, November 10, 2001.\n111 Walker\u2019s keepership formed a unique private\u2013public situation.

Withers, \u2018 \u2018\u2018Both\nuseful and ornamental\u2019\u2019 : John Walker\u2019s Keepership of Edinburgh University\u2019s Natural History Museum,\n1770\u20131803\u2019, Journal of the History of Collections (1993), 5, 65\u201377; Anderson, op. cit.

In addition to the minerals that he collected on his personal travels in\nScotland, the specimens that he acquired during the 1750s and 1760s came from two\nother sources : correspondents and patrons. Although he had been in contact with\nLinnaeus since 1762, it was Walker\u2019s 1765 trip to London that enhanced his corre-\nspondence network. He was received by English naturalists, like John Ellis, who were\nfamiliar with his name because of his Linnaean credentials and his Philosophical\nTransactions article.113 Scottish naturalists living in London would have also known of\nhim on account of his travels and connections in their home country. This connection\nback to Scotland was important because the political situation of the mid-eighteenth\ncentury had created a closely knit Scots community in London. Overseeing this network\nwere twopoliticalmagnates : LordBute andhis brother James StuartMackenzie. It seems\nthat Walker was received into this community on account of his intent to publish a\nnatural history of Scotland114 and because he knew Bute. He used this visit to obtain\ncorrespondents who were willing to trade not only minerals but also botanical and\nzoological specimens.115\nWhile in London, Walker was also put into contact with one of the best-known fossil\ntraders in Britain \u2013 \u2018Mr. da Costa, author of theHistory of Fossils, and then Librarian to\ntheRoyal Society \u2019.116During the 1760s,DaCosta providedWalkerwith awide variety of\nminerals. He sent him thirty-one \u2018Articles \u2019 in 1765 and twenty-nine in 1769.117 How\nWalker paid for these is not certain. He most probably received them in exchange for\nsending Da Costa samples from the Highlands andHebrides. Da Costa would have been\nparticularly keen on obtaining Scottish minerals on account of England\u2019s rising interest\nin the natural history of \u2018North Britain\u2019.118 The Da Costan fossils came from England,\n113 John Ellis to Linnaeus, 29 October 1765, in James E.

Walker, op. cit. (64), ff. 136\u20137.\n118 This interest was soon confirmed by the popularity of Thomas Pennant\u2019s tours (1769 and 1772) and by\nJohnson and Boswell\u2019s 1773 tour. See Pennant\u2019s A Tour in Scotland 1769, Edinburgh, 2000 and A Tour in\nScotland and Voyage to the Hebrides 1772, Edinburgh, 1998; Samuel Johnson, Johnson\u2019s Journey to the\nWestern Islands of Scotland and Boswell\u2019s Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson, LL.D,\nLondon, 1930.\n430 M. D. Eddy\nBrazil, Hungary, Florence, Russia, Sweden, Norway, Pennsylvania, Peru, Bohemia,\nFrance and several German principalities (including Saxony).119 In between these two\nshipments from Da Costa, Walker also obtained a \u2018Collection of other Fossils brought\nfrom Italy by Mr. John Sivewright of Southhouse\u2019. Sivewright had recently died and\nWalker obtained sixty-nine specimens via the deceased\u2019s sister during 1768.120 Over the\nnext thirty years, Walker continued to collect minerals in such a manner. He also began\nto hire lapidaries121 to find specific fossils. As he became part of the British mineralogical\ntrade, his own network expanded and this placed him in contact with other willing\nsuppliers and traders. For instance, his System Fossilium states that in 1772 he received\nfossils from \u2018Mr. George Wilson, Surgeon in London\u2019 and \u2018Miss Blackburn from\nOrford\u2019.122 A key point to note about these fossils is that, like the samples he collected\nhimself,Walker subjectedmany of the specimens to chemical analysis \u2013 as can be seen by\nthe ferrum intractable nitens micaceum debate already detailed above.\nWalker\u2019s other mineralogical source during the 1760s was aristocratic patrons. His\ninitial contact with the aristocracywas throughWilliamCullen. It was Cullen\u2019s chemical\nknowledge that had originally allowed him to make his own contacts among the no-\nbility.123During the 1750sCullenwas involved in introducingWalker to LordKames and\nto the Clerk family of Pennicuik.124 Walker\u2019s travels in the mid-1760s furthered his\nreputation as Cullen\u2019s prote\u00b4ge\u00b4 and placed him in contact with aristocrats like the Earl of\nLoudan (on whose land Walker sketched coal strata).125 These tours and his connection\nwith LordKames promotedWalker as a credible naturalist and led the Board of Annexed\nEstates to select him for the 1764 tour of the Hebrides and Highlands.126 In addition to\nestablishing contacts with Baron Mure, Baron Cathcart, Lord Queensbury and Lord\nHopetoun, the 1764 tour allowedWalker to befriend Lord Bute. Over the next ten years,\nWalker functioned as a scientific advisor to all four of these men.\nMost Scottish landowners were interested in mineralogy and chemistry because of\ntheir close links to mining and land improvement. It was for this reason thatWalker was\n119 Walker, op. cit. (64), ff. 144\u201352; 174\u20135. The Pennsylvanian minerals could have possibly come from\nBenjamin Franklin, whom Walker lists in his Systema Fossilium as a source for his mineralogy collection,\nop. cit. (6), f. 18.\n120 Walker, Systema Fossilium, op. cit. (6), f. 10.\n121 Walker uses the term \u2018Lapidary\u2019 to describe a person who buys or trades minerals.\n122 Walker, Systema Fossilium, op. cit. (6), f. 12.\n123 Cullen had first met the Duke of Argyll on account of His Grace\u2019s desire to obtain chemistry apparatus.\nBy 1751 Cullen was discussing chemistry with Argyll via correspondence. See \u2018Drafts of four letters from\nWilliam Cullen to the Duke of Argyll on the subjects of fossil alkali and salt production\u2019, GUL, GB 247, MS\nCullen 60. Cullen also had strong links to the Duke of Hamilton and his family. Douglas Guthrie, \u2018William\nCullen and his times\u2019, in An Eighteenth Lectureship in Chemistry: Essays and Bicentenary Addresses Relating\nto the Chemistry Department (1747) of Glasgow University (ed. J. W. Cook), Glasgow, 1950, 50\u20131.\n124 It is also likely that Cullen introduced Joseph Black to the Pennicuik family, a relationship that\nblossomed in the 1770s. See Thomson, op. cit. (65), 328\u20139.\n125 Walker, op. cit. (64), ff. 213\u201315.\n126 Cullen was also busy promotingWalker to other naturalists like Thomas Pennant: \u2018I take the liberty of\nrecommending to Mr. Walker a thorough Attention to the Zoology of the Western Isles. \u2019 Thomas Pennant to\nWilliam Cullen, 21 April 1764, EUL La.III.352\/1 ff. 9\u201310.\nThe \u2018 ingenious \u2019 Rev. Dr John Walker 431\nkeen to copy down Cullen\u2019s (circa) 1766 Lectures on Agriculture127 and to offer colliery\nobservations (like those he made for the Earl of Loudan).Walker was not the only one to\nuse chemicalmineralogy to obtain patronage. Black, Cullen\u2019s other prote\u00b4ge\u00b4, followed the\nsame pattern.128 In addition to questions of land improvement, members of the landed\nclass also consulted men like Walker, Black and Cullen because they were interested in\nwriting their own treatises on georgics \u2013 Kames\u2019sGentleman Farmer (1779) being a good\nexample.129 Quite often, such agricultural and mineralogical advice paved the way for\npolitical connections and preferential access to large tracts of land. For instance, it was\nHopetoun\u2019s Wanlock and Leadhills mines that afforded Walker the most detailed view\nof underground minerals and his mineral well (Hartfell Spa, outside of Moffat) that\nallowed Walker to publish his first article.130 Acquiring these minerals also led to their\nanalysis, both for reasons of science and patronage.131\nThis symbiotic relationship between land improvement and natural history was one\nof the main factors that propelled Walker\u2019s career, especially when the town council\nappointed him to be the professor of natural history in 1779.132 Moreover, based on\nthe careers of Walker, Cullen and Black (and others like professors Alston and Francis\nHome), it seems that mid-eighteenth-century Scottishmineralogy thrived on a reciprocal\nrelationship that existed between improvement-minded patrons and naturalists that\nwere either employed in or trained by the medical schools. If one looks at the chemical\nexperiments being performed on minerals by Edinburgh\u2019s Medical School professors\nwho taught chemistry or materia medica,133 it becomes apparent that many of their\nexperiments were directly applicable tomineralogical and chemical classification. In this\nsense the Medical School provided a key service that was characteristically associated\nwith mining academies in Europe.134\n127 JohnWalker (transcriber), Abstract fromDr. Cullen\u2019s Lectures on Agriculture (c. 1766), EUL Dc.3.70.\nJohn Thomson sets the date of these lectures to be around 1766 in his An Account of the Life, Lectures,\nand Writings of William Cullen Vol. I., Edinburgh, 1859, 64.

Secord and E. C. Spary), Cambridge, 1996, 211\u201329;\n432 M. D. Eddy\nWalker\u2019s most significant aristocratic patron was Lord Bute. Like Kames, Bute\u2019s\ninterest in natural history went beyond simple land improvement. In addition to its\neconomic value, natural history was Bute\u2019s favourite hobby.135 He had taken his degree\nfrom the University of Leiden in 1732 and, likemany naturalists, he was not content with\nthe Linnaean classification system.136 This led him to construct his own.137 In 1765 Bute\ngave Walker access to his London library138 and by 1767 it is highly likely that Bute was\nsupplying specimens to \u2018the ingenious Doctor Walker of Moffat\u2019.139 Bute must have\nthought highly of Walker\u2019s abilities because he discussed his alternative classification\nwith him.Walker specifically recorded Bute\u2019s thoughts on the classifications of gems and\nflowers in his Adversaria.140 To help develop his system, Bute had amassed a large\ncollection of minerals and plants from Britain and abroad. Wilson has suggested that his\nmineralogical collection was well over a hundred thousand specimens. If this is true,\nBute\u2019s collectionwas possibly the largest in Europe at the end of the eighteenth century.141\nBute allowedWalker to see part of his \u2018 fossil \u2019 catalogue sometime during the late 1760s.\nIn the notes thatWalker took on the collection, he states that Bute had purchased some of\nthe minerals from a Mr Maine for the sum of \u00a3300. Walker was able to view \u20181833\nNumbers of Fossils, many of which, are English & Foreign\u2019. Of these, Walker copied\ndown sixty Scottish specimens and twenty \u2018Foreign Fossils, chiefly German\u2019 \u2013 the latter\nbeing mostly metals.142 Walker continued to maintain his relationship with Bute into the\n1770s. He visited the Isle of Bute during his 1771 tour and in 1772 Bute sent BaronMure\ntwo letters enquiring about a box of books that he had bought for Walker in London.143\nBute and Walker\u2019s other patrons placed him in contact with their natural history\nnetwork at home and abroad.

The best example of this situation is a letter\nwritten from Dr John Rogerson to John Clerk, the seventh son of Sir John Clerk of\nPennicuik.151Rogerson was a former student of Cullen.

Many of them were associated with port\ncities that contained large British trading communities. They collected a wide variety of\nminerals and sent them back to British naturalists and landowners seeking to compare\ntheir ores, minerals and metals to those from abroad.153 During the 1760s this network\nflourished under the patronage of Baron Charles Cathcart, the British Ambassador to\nRussia. Walker was included in this network because he had formed close links to the\nCathcart and Hopetoun families. As the above excerpt indicates, the mineralogical\nrewards of such a network would have no doubt provided more specimens that would\neventually help him write his own mineralogical system.\nConclusion\nThis article has detailed the early mineralogical career of Rev. Dr John Walker, with\nspecific focus on how he analysed, arranged and acquired \u2018fossils \u2019. It began by showing\nthat chemistry was one of the main forms of analysis used for ascertaining mineral\ncharacters in eighteenth-century Scotland. Although he was familiar with other theories,\nWalker wasmost influenced by five-principle chemistry. He was introduced to this when\nstudying at the University of Edinburgh and via his mentorWilliam Cullen. This form of\nchemistry favoured the Becher\u2013Stahl School\u2019s concept of a \u2018Primary Earth\u2019 that chemi-\ncally analysed stones and then classified them based on which Primary Earth they\ncontained. With the help of Cullen and Kames, Walker entered into the Scottish natural\nhistory scene during the 1750s and continued to use chemistry to ascertain the chemical\ncharacters of minerals. Although the Swedes, Germans and French promoted chemical\nmineralogy at this time, it was the Swedish authors that had the most profound effect on\nthe mineralogy practised by Walker and several of his contemporaries. He first used\nWallerius and Cronstedt in the 1760s and then went on to use Bergman in the 1770s. The\ninfluence of Swedish mineralogy remained strong when he began to give his mineralogy\nlectures in the 1780s and he continued to cite these authors up until he died in 1803. The\nfact that he taught chemical mineralogy to seven hundred or more students during his\ntime as a professor suggests that this form of analysis (and the sources that he cited)\ndeserve a closer look \u2013 especially sincemany of these studentsweremembers of theRoyal\n152 Dr John Rogerson to John Clerk, 23 August 1772, National Archives of Scotland, GD 18\/5121\/3. The\nletter is dated St Petersburg. It also mentions DrHope and seed specimens that were collected for Catherine the\nGreat by Professor Laxman. The connection with Pallas would eventually find fruition in 1783 when he sent\nWalker 129 fossils from Siberia for Edinburgh\u2019s Natural History Museum. Whithers, op. cit. (111), 70.\n153 See J.

Koerner also treats various aspects of the Baltic mineralogy in \u2018Daedalus\nHyperboreus: Baltic natural history and mineralogy in the Enlightenment\u2019, in The Sciences in Enlightened\nEurope (ed.

Dr John Walker 435\nSociety of Edinburgh during the years when the different versions of James Hutton\u2019s\nTheory of the Earth were debated and published. Indeed, Hutton\u2019s original 1785\nmonograph treats the sea as if it were one gigantic flask in which \u2018loose materials had\nformed into solidmasses\u2019.154 Even though this process involved heat, the older professors\nof the Medical School like Walker, Black and Cullen would have used saline chemical\nvocabulary to describe many of processes implied in Hutton\u2019s account of the \u2018globe\u2019.155\nWalker\u2019s career demonstrates that acquiring and analysing minerals in eighteenth-\ncentury Scotland was a symbiotic relationship. The best example of this situation was\nWalker\u2019s involvement with the Hope family. There is no doubt that his 1757 Philo-\nsophical Transactions paperwould have pleased JohnHope, the second LordHopetoun,\nbecause Hartfell Spa (the medicinal well under examination) was on his land. It should\ntherefore come as no surprise to see that Walker was appointed to be the minister of\nMoffat in 1762 \u2013 a town in which the Hope family exerted a considerable amount of\ninfluence (indeed, they donated the land on which the town\u2019s present church is built).\nLiving in Moffat placed several of the Hopetoun mines within a day\u2019s walking distance.\nEven though it is not certain as to what extent Walker was involved in guiding the\nfamily\u2019s view on ore or coal prospecting, it is clear that he made himself available to\ngive advice on the minerals being dug out of their mines.156 The links that he made with\nthe Hope family early in his career became very useful later in his life. During the late\n1770s, the second Lord Hopetoun helped Walker secure his professorship and gave him\naccess to mineral specimens that he had acquired while travelling abroad.157 After the\nsecondLordHopetoun died in 1781, JamesHope, the third LordHopetoun, continued to\nsupply the Natural History Museum with specimens158 and politically supported\nWalker\u2019s involvement in the creation of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783.159\nTo this day several of the marble slabs given by the Hopes to the Natural History\nMuseum still bearWalker\u2019s handwriting on their labels \u2013 amemorial to the strong bonds\nthat existed between eighteenth-century mineralogy and patronage.160\n154 James Hutton,Abstract of a Dissertation Read in the Royal Society of Edinburgh, upon the Eleventh of\nMarch, and Fourth of April, M,DCC, LXXXV,Concerning the System of the Earth, its Duration and Stability,\nEdinburgh, 1785, 8.\n155 This situation becomes particularly interesting when one considers that it took some time before the\nnew nomenclature was accepted in Edinburgh. This is treated in A. Lundgren and B. Bensaude-Vincent (eds),\nCommunicatingChemistry: Textbooks and their Audiences, 1789\u20131939, Canton,MA, 2000. SeeA.Donovan\u2019s\ntwo articles on this context: \u2018Scottish responses to the new chemistry of Lavoisier\u2019, Studies in Eighteenth-\nCentury Culture (1979), 9, 237\u201349; and \u2018Chemistry and philosophy in the Scottish Enlightenment\u2019, Studies on\nVoltaire and the Eighteenth Century (1976), 152, 587\u2013605. The delayed reception of the new nomenclature\nin light of national contexts is treated in B. Bensaude-Vincent and F. Abbri, Lavoisier in European Context:\nNegotiating a New Language for Chemistry, Canton, MA, 1995.\n156 In addition to Walker, the Hopetoun mines were also visited by Thomas Pennant and R. E. Raspe. See\nM. D. Eddy, \u2018James Hope Johnstone, third Earl of Hopetoun (1741\u20131816)\u2019, New DNB (forthcoming, 2004).\n157 Waterston, op. cit. (57), 22.\n158 Lord Hopetoun is also listed as a patron of the museum in a report written by Walker around 1786.\nEUL La.III.352\/5 f. 1.\n159 Shapin treats this in op. cit. (132).\n160 There were over one hundred of these marble specimens, many of which are housed in the National\nMuseum of Scotland, reference number G1993.34.\n436 M. D. Eddy\nIn addition to the Hope family, Walker was able to procure his specimens from a\nvariety of other sources. Themost immediatewas his ownbackyard. Since thiswas a time\nwhen physicians and apothecaries still had to scour the countryside for pharmacological\nsimples, his training at Edinburgh\u2019s Medical School and with Cullen proved to be very\nuseful because it had taught him how to utilize the specimens that existed in his own\nlocality. Since his career demonstrates that lapidaries and savant suppliers existed in\nhealthy numbers in Scotland and London,more research needs to be done to see just who\n\u2018Mr. John Sivewright\u2019 and \u2018Mr.GeorgeWilson\u2019 actuallywere andwhat sorts of network\nthey used to procure and sell \u2018 fossils \u2019. Walker\u2019s list of mineralogical suppliers would be\nan excellent place to start for such research because it shows that Baltic sources were just\nas important as those that came from the Mediterranean and, to a lesser extent, the\nAmericas. Such a wide variety of locations also suggests that Scottish mineralogy, like\nbotany, benefited from Britain\u2019s central position in eighteenth-century trade and colon-\nization. The emphasis placed upon mineralogical topics in the Medical School led many\nof the physicians and surgeons assigned to naval or diplomatic posts to be on the lookout\nfor foreign fossils. A good example of this practice is Dr John Rogerson and the samples\nthat he sent to Walker from St Petersburg. The efforts of such mineralizing physicians\nwere often reinforced by the patronage of Scottish ambassadors who owned mines and\nwho wanted to compare their ores to those of foreign countries. It was probably for this\nreason that Lord Cathcart, the British ambassador to Russia, collected ores and gave\npatronage to physicians like Rogerson. Another diplomat interested in mineralogy was\nRobert Liston, the ambassador to Spain. He used his influence to acquire and send\nWalker several different types of ore during the 1780s. The motivations for supplying\nforeignminerals were therefore complex and the cases of these physicians and diplomats,\nor even that of Da Costa and Walker, force the researcher to consider the motivations\nof those who participated in the mineralogical trade. Were minerals simply collected\nbecause of their novelty, or were they initially selected to be compared chemically to\nindigenous ores and pharmaceutical simples that could be commodified?\nTo answer this question, more work will have to be done on the eighteenth-century\nmineralogical scene in Britain, not just for Scotland, but also for England, Ireland\nand Wales. Not only do the practising mineralogists need to be more clearly identified,\nbut the sources that were used as field guides and in university medical courses\nalso need to be surveyed. Since many medical professors still read Latin, books in this\nlanguage also will also have to be considered. Additionally, local chorographies, stat-\nistical surveys and even mining records should also be consulted. For example, the\nmineralogical content of Highland and Hebrides tour reports,161 The Statistical Account\nof Scotland (1791\u20139),162 and accounts written in other European languages need to be\n161 Walker\u2019s Kings MS, op. cit.

Indeed, a serious historical treatment of min-\neralogists on the scale of Ray Desmond\u2019s edition of the Dictionary of British and Irish\nBotanists has yet to be written. No matter which path is taken, the world of eighteenth-\ncentury mineralogy will remain an intriguing field for those wishing to investigate the\nmany faces of eighteenth-century chemistry and natural history.\n\u2018Number XXI.
