Albert Thomas, 87060 Limoges Cedex, France.\nmartensitic plates in bulk and splat-cooled Ni65Al35, and attempt to understand how some of the\nobserved features arise in terms of the deformation process starting from the cubic austenite.\nA fundamental problem for martensitic transformations is to predict the morphology of the\nmicrostructure arising in a given experimental situation. This is a challenging problem of pattern\nformation, but one that is currently out of reach because of the major difficulties of modelling,\nanalysis and computation that it gives rise to. Considerable insight has, however, been gained by\nthe use of static continuum theories based on elasticity and variants of it (e.g., incorporating\ninterfacial energy). Under idealized assumptions about the crystal, for example that it is a single\ncrystal free of defects, and about its thermo-mechanical environment, such theories provide\nsignificant information on possible microstructures, and in particular illuminate the role of\ngeometric compatibility. However, they are not truly predictive in the sense that typically they\npermit many different equi-energetic configurations. (Of course, it might be that a good dynamical\nmodel might have unstable or chaotic properties that make it non-predictive also, but that is a\ndifferent issue.) Also, in reality the idealized assumptions made are often questionable. For\nexample, only very high quality bulk single crystals will have relatively few defects. Most samples\nexist as regular ingots, for which the implications of the static theories are less precise, and inside\nthe sample the local microstructure will depend on such features as the relative orientation between\ngrains, the different grain sizes, slight composition differences and thus different transformation\ntemperatures, different temperature histories due to different locations within the ingot etc... . Such\ndifferences can even be enhanced by using special preparation techniques such as melt-spinning or\nsplat-cooling. Moreover, the effects arising from the dynamic nature of a first-order transformation\ninvolving several progressing interfaces add many more degrees of freedom than those considered\nin the static models.\nIn the present work atomic details of particular microscopic configurations resulting from the\ncubic-to-tetragonal martensitic transformation in Ni65Al35 will be discussed. At this composition,\nthe transformation occurs around 250 \u00b0C [1]. The ideal orientation relationships between, e.g., twin\nand habit planes have been predicted before by the conventional crystallographic theories and have\nin some cases already been documented for this transformation [2-4]. However, the actual atomic\nconfigurations at the interfaces reveal remarkable features which indicate a higher level of\ncomplexity than current theoretical discussions take into account. In this paper, the emphasis of the\nexperimental data will be on macrotwin interfaces involving two families of microtwin planes and\ntwo out of the three possible deformation variants of the martensite. This choice implies that the\nmicrotwins in the two plates involved originate from two perpendicular {110} families of planes in\nthe austenite.\nUnfortunately, the high speed and small hysteresis of the transformation usually result in\ncompletely transformed samples at room temperature and major difficulties for in-situ temperature\nwork, the latter also being hampered by thin foil effects in transmission electron microscopy\nsamples. As a result, the actual dynamic origin of a given structure usually cannot be followed\ndirectly and has to be inferred from its final configuration. In this paper details of such\nconfigurations are described based on room temperature (HR)TEM observations. These\nconfigurations are then discussed in terms of the dynamics of the austenite-martensite\ntransformation, which play an essential role in the shape-memory behaviour of many of these\nalloys.\n2. Experimental procedures\nNi-Al bulk material with a Ni content of 65 at% Ni was prepared in the form of ingots by arc\nmelting starting from 99.99% pure elements. The ingots were homogenised by annealing for one\nhour at 1250\u00b0C, followed by a water quench. Ni-Al splat-cooled samples of the same composition\nwere prepared by pressing a free falling droplet of the melt in between two copper pistons that\nwere shot against each other with a velocity of 8 m.s-1. The solidification of the melt results from\nthe heat transfer occurring during the contact of the pistons with the melt. A cooling rate of\napproximately 9x105 K.s-1 is obtained. The resulting discs have a diameter of approximately\n20mm and a thickness of about 200\u00b5m. From both bulk and splat-cooled samples, 3mm diameter\ndiscs suitable for TEM observations were obtained. These discs were then thinned by the double-\njet electropolishing technique using a Struers Tenupol-3 instrument [5]. Whenever relevant, the\norigin of every image shown is indicated, although no firm distinctions between the results from\nbulk versus splat-cooled samples could be drawn.\nElectron diffraction work and low magnification observations were carried out using a Philips\nCM20 microscope operating at 200kV and fitted with an eucentric goniometer (\u00b145\u00ba). The\nHRTEM images were recorded on a JEOL 4000EX top-entry microscope (double-tilt \u00b120\u00ba)\noperating at 400kV. Both instruments are equipped with a LaB6 filament.\n3. The martensitic transformation in Ni-Al\nIn order to be able to describe the observations properly, we first give a short description of the\ntransformation and the structures involved. For clarity we will also briefly recall the description of\nthe martensitic transformation in the framework of nonlinear thermoelasticity [6-8], a more\nrigorous and general approach than the classical crystallographic theories [9-12], with a focus on\nthe cubic-to-tetragonal transition encountered in the Ni-Al alloys [13, 14].\nIn the nonlinear thermoelasticity approach, microstructural features such as twins in martensite\nor austenite\/martensite interfaces are described by minimizers and minimizing sequences for the\nbulk elastic energy corresponding to a free energy density \u03c6(F,\u03b8) which depends only on the\ndeformation gradient F = \u2207y(x) and the temperature \u03b8. A first fundamental invariance property of\nthe free energy function is its frame-indifference, i.e. invariance under rigid body rotations, namely\nthat \u03c6(RF,\u03b8) = \u03c6(F,\u03b8) for any rotation matrix R. In particular, for any matrices F that minimize\n\u03c6(F,\u03b8), all matrices RF are also minimizers. The second invariance property results from the\nexistence of symmetries within the crystal, namely \u03c6(FQ,\u03b8) = \u03c6(F,\u03b8) for any Q in the point group.\nThe reference configuration is chosen to be the undistorted austenite at the austenite-martensite\ntransformation temperature \u03b80, and it is assumed that F = 1 minimizes \u03c6(F,\u03b80). Due to frame\nindifference, all rotations R minimize \u03c6(F,\u03b80) and define what is called the austenite energy well.\nDuring the transformation, the cubic lattice of the austenite is distorted to a tetragonal unit cell\nby elongating one of the cubic axes by a factor \u03b73 > 1 and shortening the other two by a factor \u03b71\n< 1 (figs. 1 and 2). In the homogeneous deformation y = U1x, which transforms the austenite to\nthe martensite, the matrix U1 represents the transformation strain or Bain strain and has the form\nU1 = Diag[\u03b73,\u03b71,\u03b71]. We can regard U1 as the representation of one deformation variant of the\nmartensite and it is assumed that F = U1 minimizes \u03c6(F,\u03b80).\nFollowing symmetry considerations, the cubic-to-tetragonal transformation leads to the\nexistence of three variants of martensite. The remaining two possibilities, U2 and U3, are obtained\nby permuting the diagonal elements of the matrix, so that U2 = Diag[\u03b71,\u03b73,\u03b71] and U3 =\nDiag[\u03b71,\u03b71,\u03b73]. Using frame indifference, all matrices F = RiUi where Ri is a rotation also\nminimize \u03c6(F,\u03b80) and define the ith martensite energy well. In practice, these rotations are needed to\nclose the gap between the lattices of both variants resulting from the deformation, as indicated in\nfig. 1b. As a result, certain former parallel cubic planes and directions now enclose an angle \u03b3 as\nindicated in the figure. After the transformation the entire product microstructure should\ncorrespond to a continuous energy-minimizing deformation. For low energy microstructures the\ndeformation gradient \u2207y(x) must be close to the martensite energy wells in most of the sample.\nThe requirement of continuity (for example, coherency at the austenite-martensite habit plane), the\nsurface energy of the intervariant boundaries etc ... play key roles in determining the possible final\nmicrostructures.\nIn the case of Ni-Al, the austenite phase has a CsCl-type ordering based on a body-centred-\ncubic (bcc) lattice and is often referred to as the \u03b2- or B2-phase (fig. 2). The excess Ni is\naccommodated by random occupation of Ni atoms at the Al sublattice sites [15]. As the martensitic\ntransformation is purely displacive, this ordering is retained in the martensite, as illustrated in fig.\n2a. Following conventional Bravais lattice notations, the martensite should be viewed as a body-\ncentred-tetragonal (bct) lattice, but in order to account for the resulting L10 type (CuAu I) ordering\nin the martensite, this structure is traditionally described using a face-centred-tetragonal (fct) lattice\nand often referred to as the \u03b8-phase. As a result, the microtwin planes of the product structure,\nwhich correspond to the invariant shear of the transformation, are {111} type planes in the L10\nmartensite structure and originate from certain {110} type planes of the austenite structure. As\nseen from fig. 2a, the cubic axis that is elongated during the transformation always becomes the c-\naxis of the product fct cell. In the following discussion, the fct unit cell will be used for the\ndescription of the martensite lattice, although the bct cell corresponds with the tetragonal shapes of\nthe three variants in fig. 1.\nWhen referring to this L10 structure the notion of close packed planes becomes relevant.\nIndeed, the cubic-to-tetragonal transformation deforms the open rectangular {110}B2 planes into\nnearly hexagonal {111} planes of the face centred cell, which for the current ordering are as dense\nas possible. The first drawing of fig. 2b shows a two-dimensional projection along a <001> axis of\nthe austenite structure, its cubic unit cell being indicated by faint lines. The other two drawings of\nfig. 2b show the effect of transformations U1 and U2 (i.e., those with the elongation direction in the\nplane of the drawing) in this projection. When the original (110)B2 plane indicated by a heavy line\nis used as a reference, these two variants yield different stacking sequences ABC and ACB of the\nclose packed planes in the product structure. This is seen from the indicated projections (dashed\nlines) onto the, now (111)\n L10, reference plane and which arrive at the fixed positions labeled A, B\nand C. The direction of projection is not exactly perpendicular to the reference plane due to the fact\nthat the L10 structure is not perfectly cubic but has a c\/a ratio slightly deviating from unity. As the\nopposite stacking sequences for both variants can be regarded as resulting from opposite shearing\ndirections (indicated by arrows in fig. 2b), different volume fractions for variants U1 and U2 will\nyield a net total shearing for a given plate.\n4. Relations between martensite variants and plates:\nconceptual discussion\nIn order to facilitate the interpretation of the experimental observations, we give in this section a\nconceptual discussion with the emphasis on which type of interfaces can be expected. In the case\nof the first-order cubic-to-tetragonal transformation in Ni-Al, different martensite plates consisting\nof a sequence of two different variants of the product phase as defined above can nucleate and\ngrow in the austenite matrix, as shown schematically in fig. 3. Here the austenite is viewed along\nthe [001]B2 direction, which will also be the assumed viewing direction in the calculations\ndiscussed below, and the martensite along <110]L10 directions, the latter depending on the actual\nvariant. Within each plate both variants are in compound twin relation with one another and the\nresulting interfaces will henceforth be referred to as microtwin boundaries or simply microtwins.\nMinimization of the elastic energy yields unequal relative widths for both variants (except for\nspecial values of the deformation parameters [6, 12, 13]) resulting in a given volume fraction \u03bb, a\nsmall rotation \u03b8 of the microtwin plane with respect to the corresponding {110}B2 plane and a\nhabit plane, i.e., the interface between the austenite and martensite regions, with normal m. For the\npresent case this habit plane is close to a {101)B2 plane. Such planes make an angle of 60\u00b0 with the\n{110)B2 planes, i.e., the planes in the parent phase that will transform into the microtwin planes for\nthe present product variants. In fact, the angle \u03c8 between the {110)B2 planes and the corresponding\nhabit plane is given by the formula\nsin ( )\u03c8\n\u03b7 \u03b7\n\u03b7 \u03b7\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212\n3\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n3\n22 1\nwhich for the present deformation parameters (see \u00a7 6) yields \u03c8 = 64.9\u00b0.\nAs the final microtwin configuration depends on the deformation parameters, some measures\nsuch as the angle \u03b3 and the volume fraction \u03bb of the smallest variant, can be calculated in terms of\nthe deformation parameters:\ncos\n( )( )( )\n( )\u03b3\n\u03b7 \u03b7\n\u03b7 \u03b7\n\u03bb \u03b7 \u03b7 \u03b7 \u03b7\n\u03b7 \u03b7\n=\n+\n= \u2212 +\n\u2212 \u2212 +\n\u2212\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n2 1\n2\n1 1 2 1 11 3\n1\n2\n3\n2\n1\n2\n3\n2\n1\n2\n3\n2\n3\n2\n1\n2 2   and   \nTo a first approximation, both variants within a given plate rotate through equal and opposite\nangles \u00b1\u03b3\/2 about the normal to the plane of the drawing, forming microtwin planes parallel to the\nprior austenite (110) planes. However, compatibility with the austenite requires that there is a small\nrigid-body rotation of the entire plate that destroys this balance, so that the final orientation of one\nvariant will be closer to its non-rotated tetragonal orientation than for the other, the microtwin\nplanes not being exactly parallel with the prior austenite (110) planes.\nAs a result of the growth of such martensite plates, the entire austenite matrix is transformed,\nresulting in different interplate interfaces with atomic configurations depending on the actual\nvariants and orientations in each of the impinging plates. If we disregard the local variations which\nindifferently occur in each plate (e.g., local deviations from the average volume fraction), those\ninterfaces existing between prior plates with different families of microtwin planes (e.g., prior\n(110)B2 and (1-10)B2) but the same choice of variants (e.g., U1 and U2) can be considered as mirror\nplanes and thus be called macrotwin boundaries or interfaces. When two such plates with close to\nperpendicular microtwins meet, it can be expected that this symmetry plane will be parallel to a\ncubic {100}B2 plane, mirroring, e.g., (110)B2 into (1-10)B2 microtwins. Still, as different internal\nconfigurations for each plate can exist and as the kinetics of the plate growth can also be expected\nto play a role, the exact choice of a (100)B2 versus a (010)B2 macrotwin plane can be more\ncomplicated.\nFor plate I in fig. 3 the microtwin planes are chosen to originate from (110)B2 planes and\ndeformation variants U1 and U2 are combined, with U1 occupying the largest volume. These\nchoices fix the exact orientation of the microtwin planes and limit the possibilities for the habit\nplane to two equivalent ones (-x,y,1)B2 and (x,-y,1)B2. In the figure, the microtwin planes are\nobserved edge-on while the habit planes are inclined. Plate II uses the same deformation variants\nwith the same volume ratio (i.e., again volume U1 > volume U2), but a different set of microtwin\nplanes, here (1-10)B2, perpendicular to the previous family. Therefore crystallographically\nequivalent, but intrinsically different, habit planes will occur, again with two possible orientations.\nFor the present introductory description any additional effects due to the small rigid body rotations\nare ignored. Suppose now that both plates nucleate separately in a given austenite grain. They can\nthen join in different ways along a {100}B2 plane. First, the choice of U1 as the variant with the\nlargest volume fraction immediately implies different atomic configurations depending on the\nactual choice between a (100)B2 or (010)B2 plane as macrotwin. Indeed, joining along the (100)B2\nplane implies that the elongation directions (i.e., the fct c-axes) of variants U1 on either side are\nclose to perpendicular to this new interface. On the other hand, joining along the (010)B2 plane\nmeans that these directions are close to parallel with the formed macrotwin. These are features\nwhich can be recognized from the HRTEM images and will thus be helpful in characterising the\nmacrotwin interfaces. Second, for each of the possibilities just listed, still two different habit planes\nfor each plate can be involved. The general expression for the two possible habit plane normals\nm1,2 per plate (one for each choice of \u03c7) is given by\n  \nm1 2\n3\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n3\n2\n3\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n2 2\n1 1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n,\n[ ( ), ( ), ]= + \u2212 = \u00b1\n=\n+ \u2212\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u03c7 \u03b4 \u03c4 \u03c7 \u03ba \u03c4 \u03b4 \u03c7\n\u03b4 \u03b7 \u03b7\n\u03b7\n\u03c4\n\u03b7 \u03b7 \u03b7 \u03b7\n\u03b7\n   with   \nwhere       and   \nwhere \u03ba = \u00b11 defines the choice of microtwin plane orientation (i.e., \u03ba = +1 yields plate I, \u03ba = -1\nyields plate II). Such habit planes are thus distinctly different from any symmetry plane of the\naustenite. As the Miller indices for the normals to these habit planes only differ in sign for the x\nand y co-ordinates, if the final joining plane is (100)B2 or (010)B2, this joining plane may or may\nnot be a mirror plane for the two habit planes involved. For example, when plates I and II with\nhabit planes (x \u2013y 1) and (-x \u2013y 1), respectively, meet along a (100)B2 plane, then the latter can be\nconsidered as a high symmetry plane. However, if for the same habit plane for plate I, plate II has a\n(x y 1) habit plane, this is no longer the case. Therefore, in total we can expect essentially four\ndifferent configurations for this starting set of two crystallographically equivalent martensite plates,\ni.e., two per choice of macrotwin plane, one with the final interface being a mirror plane for the\nhabit planes involved, the other one not. Changing the choice of the variant with the largest volume\nfraction does not affect this conclusion, although a permutation between the x and y co-ordinates is\nfound for the habit plane normals. Another potentially relevant factor could be the common line\nbetween the habit planes of both plates. Indeed, when two plates meet they will first get in contact\nalong this common line which could enforce a choice of actual macrotwin interface plane. In the\nfirst example used above, this common line belongs to the (100)B2 plane, the high symmetry plane\nalready considered. However, for the second example, i.e., when the habit plane choice for plate II\nchanges, this common line belongs to the (010)B2 plane.\nAt this point the small rotations of the microtwin planes with respect to their original\n{110)B2 planes can be incorporated. The net angle of rotation \u03b8 can be calculated to be given by\ncos ( )\u03b8\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\n=\n+\n+\n1\n1\n3\n2\n3\nz\nz\nwith z =\n+\u2212 \u2212\u03b7 \u03b71 2 3 2\n2\n.\nwith the rotation axis being [-\u03ba\u03c7,  \u03c7, \u03ba\u03b4]. As both plates involved correspond to a different sign\nfor \u03ba and thus for the c-component of the rotation axis, this yields opposite rotation directions\nfor both plates. Filling in typical values for the present austenite-martensite transformation it is\nfound that a (110)B2 family of microtwin planes with volume U1 > volume U2 (i.e., plate I)\nyields a clockwise rotation of the intersection of the microtwin planes with the (x,y) plane (in\nthe orientation of fig. 3), whereas a (1-10)B2 family with the same choice of variant ratio\nundergoes a counterclockwise rotation: these rotations are indicated in fig. 3 as winged arrows.\nAs a result, when two such plates meet along a (100)B2 macrotwin plane an \u03b1 angle > 90\u00b0 will be\nobserved. Alternatively, when they meet along a (010)B2 plane, this angle will be < 90\u00b0 as seen\nfrom the inset in fig. 3.\nThe same conclusion can be reached in an intuitive manner when describing the martensitic\ntransformation by its shearing mechanism depicted in fig. 2b. Indeed, irrespective of the nucleation\npoint and direction of growth of a plate with volume U1 > volume U2 and microtwin planes parallel\nwith (110)B2 planes, the net shear of such a plate will, in order not to introduce too much strain, be\ncompensated by a clockwise rotation (the arrows inside plate I in fig. 3 indicate the shearing\ndirections assuming a growth from left to right, cf. fig. 2b), while the reverse is true for a plate with\n(1-10)B2 microtwin planes. As a result, the net rotation of the lattice in U1 with respect to the\noriginal B2 lattice will be partially compensated and become smaller than that in U2.\nThe macrotwin boundaries described above, with close to perpendicular microtwin planes on\neither side, can thus be formed by using only two out of the three available deformation variants.\nBecause of the symmetry relations between the plates involved, some of these macrotwins are\nexpected to lie along cubic planes of the austenite. If the third variant is allowed to participate in the\nmicrostructure, also macrotwin interfaces with an angle close to 120\u00b0 between the two families of\nmicrotwins can be constructed, for example separating a U1\/U2 plate from a U2\/U3 plate. In the\nlatter case, the macrotwin boundary is calculated to be along the {110}B2 plane at \u00b160\u00b0 from the\n{110}B2 planes used for the microtwins on both sides [13]. As the 90\u00b0 cases were most\nabundantly observed, only these cases will further be explored in the present paper.\nWe now observe that the compatibility conditions for two plates arising from different habit\nplanes to be compatible across a macrotwin interface at zero-energy are exactly the same as for the\nexistence of the wedge microstructure considered by Bhattacharya [13], with the macrotwin\ninterface corresponding to the wedge midrib. Bhattacharya showed that for a cubic-to-tetragonal\ntransformation it is impossible to have a zero-energy macrotwin with a {100}B2 interface, and that\nthe 120\u00b0 case with a {110}B2 interface can occur, but only if the deformation parameters satisfy the\nspecial relation\n\u03b7 \u03b7 \u03b7 \u03b7\n\u03b7 \u03b71\n2 3\n2 2\n3\n2\n3\n2\n3\n2 2\n3\n4\n1 4 1\n1 8\n=\n\u2212 + +\n\u2212 +\n( ) ( )\n( )\nwhich is in fact very nearly satisfied in our case. This implies that the observed 90\u00b0 configurations\nare expected to show structural features arising from the need to accommodate stresses that occur\nwhen both plates meet. As will be shown, some observations indeed point towards extra\nmechanisms for the relief of local stress.\nIn the above description, no attention was paid to the L10 type ordering of the lattice. This\nordering becomes visible under HRTEM conditions when the corresponding projected structure\nreveals different atomic columns. This, combined with the need for edge-on microtwin planes to\navoid overlapping effects, is the case only when looking along one of the shortened cubic\ndirections of the austenite. The elongated direction then lies in the plane of the image. As a result,\nwhen observing a 90\u00b0 macrotwin, the ordering in all variants can be made visible simultaneously\nwith all microtwins being observed close to edge-on. The corresponding prior austenite direction is\nthen [001] while the martensite variants are observed along <110] type directions. For the 120\u00b0\nmacrotwins, the microtwins can only be observed edge-on when the viewing direction in the\naustenite is <111>. As a result, the martensite variants will be observed along <101] type directions\nand therefore no ordering will be visible in the variants.\n5. Experimental observations\n5.1. Mesoscale configuration of macrotwin boundaries\nExperimentally, for both bulk and splat-cooled samples, a diversity of macrotwin boundaries is\nobserved when viewed at a \u201cmesoscale\u201d (low and medium magnifications). Indeed, as illustrated\nin fig. 4 the macrotwin boundaries can be almost a plane or they can reveal a zig-zag or wavy\nconfiguration. Still, even without descending to the atomic level, the fine structure of all these\nmacrotwin boundaries can be described using two basic constitutive elements. These two elements\nare clearly distinct and will be referred to as crossing type and step type elements. The crossings\nseen in fig. 4a correspond to situations where the two plates have similar microtwin widths and the\nterminology refers to the fact that the deformations of one plate are seen to penetrate to some\nextent into the other plate. The resulting macrotwin boundary is a prior {100}B2 plane.  The steps\nin fig. 4b reveal a configuration in which one set of microtwins ends at a twin plane of the other\nplate and this over a distance of several microtwins. This situation is seen to occur in cases where\nthere is a strong but local variation in twin width on one or both sides of the interface. The single\nstep in fig. 4a is also found at a site where changes in the twin widths occur (finer on the left,\nbroader on the right). Usually, the smallest twins seem to be stopped by the plate accommodating\nthe widest twins, the latter thus providing the macrotwin interface which is, locally, a prior {110}B2\nplane.\nThe combination of these two constitutive elements can explain the diversity in macrotwin\nboundaries observed at a mesoscale. When the crossing type boundary is dominant, the interface\nis ideally a prior {100}B2 plane as in fig. 4a and in the lower part of the fig. 4b. When the step\ntype boundary is dominant, a zig-zag configuration is observed which corresponds with the\nalternation of (110)B2 and (1-10)B2 planes for the interface as in the upper part of the fig. 4b. Note\nthat a configuration with regular step sizes yields a macrotwin boundary with an average\norientation again corresponding to a prior {100}B2 plane. Finally, the combination of these two\nconstitutive elements in a more or less random way and with differences in the width of the blocks\ncan give wavy macrotwin boundaries or an abrupt change in the direction of the macrotwin\nboundary (bottom part fig. 4b), in which case the definition of an average direction for the\nmacrotwin boundary is less relevant.\nAn alternative distinction on the mesoscale can be made by measuring the angle between the\ntwo families of microtwin planes. Irrespective of the step or crossing nature of the macrotwin\ninterface, angles larger or smaller than 90\u00b0 have been observed, as indicated in fig. 4. The fact that\neven for a single macrotwin interface both cases can be measured, providing a drastic change in\norientation of the boundary, as seen in fig. 4b, indicates that this feature has some correlation with\nthe plate growth, rather than with the original nucleation configuration. The comparison with 90\u00b0 of\ncourse stems from the fact that the prior {110)B2 planes of these two sets of microtwin planes are\nperpendicular to one another. This angle will be referred to below as \u03b1.\nIn what follows we will focus on the crossing type boundaries, the details of the atomic\nstructure around the step type boundaries being discussed in a previous publication [16].\n5.2. Atomic structure at macrotwin boundaries\nWhen observing the 90\u00b0 macrotwin boundaries at high magnification and under atomic\nresolution conditions as in fig. 5, it is seen that in every case the widest microtwin variants on both\nsides of the interface belong to the same deformation variant, e.g., U1 as in fig. 3. Of course, as the\ncorresponding variants and plates involved will be slightly rotated in different directions, the final\norientation of the similar variants will also slightly differ. The angle \u03b3 defined above is measured as\n12.5\u00b0, which yields a 6.25\u00b0 rotation per variant when assuming the same but opposite rigid body\nrotation for each variant.\nWhen boundaries with different angles between the two families of microtwin planes, i.e., larger\nor smaller then 90\u00b0, are compared on a HRTEM scale some systematic observations can be made,\nirrespective of the origin of the material. In fig. 5 both cases are represented for crossing type\nboundaries from which it is seen that in the case where \u03b1 < 90\u00b0 the c-axis (fig. 5a), i.e., the\nelongated direction, of the largest microtwin variant is close to parallel with the macrotwin\ninterface. On the contrary, for \u03b1 > 90\u00b0 (fig. 5b) this direction is close to perpendicular to this\ninterface. Moreover, for the \u03b1 < 90\u00b0 case the tips of the smallest microtwin variants are seen to\ncurve towards the macrotwin interface whereas for the \u03b1 > 90\u00b0 case they curve away from it, as\nindicated by arrows on the images. The actual measured angles between the two families of\nmicrotwin planes differ considerably from interface to interface: values ranging from 84\u00b0 to 97\u00b0\nhave been found.  Moreover, in some cases the microtwin planes are visibly bending or reorienting\nin areas between 50 to 500 nm away from the interface (see e.g. fig. 6), in which case the above\nmeasurement depends on the actual choice of reference plane, i.e., close to or far away from the\nmacrotwin.\nOn the HRTEM images in fig. 5a and b, respectively from a bulk and a splat-cooled material,\nthe general configuration of the crossing type boundary appears to be similar for both cases,\nirrespective of the difference in \u03b1. The two microtwin sequences are seen to penetrate each other\nso that all four twin variants are in contact and thus involved in the formation of the interface. This\ninterface is not a sharp plane but rather a transition layer of approximately 5 - 10 nm wide around\na prior {100}B2 plane acting as a mirror and allowing for a gradual rotation of the atom planes\nfrom the core of one microtwin sequence into the other. This results in a mixed deformation region\nat the transition layer, as evidenced by the power spectra of the U1 variants in fig. 5. To within an\nexperimental error of 2%, all spectra show a rectangular pattern of the same size and x\/y ratio, the\nonly difference being their actual orientation. Thus, the atomic lattice in the central U1 region at the\nmacrotwin interface has essentially the same lattice parameters as the lattice inside the plates, but it\nis rotated to an average orientation in between those on either side. As a continuous bending of a\nlattice implies local lattice deformations as well (compression below and elongation above), this\nindicates that most of the deformations needed to go from one plate to the other are accommodated\nin the tips of the small U2 variants separating the central U1 regions from those inside both plates.\nIndeed, these tips show a very blurred HRTEM image at the macrotwin interface, which can be\nattributed to severe local lattice deformations. The actual angle between the prior [100]B2 directions\nin the U1 variants on either side of the interface is observed to be 6-8\u00b0, while that for the U2\nvariants is 14-16\u00b0, as measured from different areas and different plates. The observed difference\nbetween the large and small variants corresponds well with the fact that the rigid body rotation\nbrings the larger variants closer to their undeformed orientation, as indicated in \u00a74.\nThese central regions are further distinguished from the core of the plates by the small\nmicrotwin variants of one sequence penetrating into the broad variants of the other sequence. In\nthese zones, the penetrating microtwin variant tends to disappear with the formation of a needle\nusually tapered to the next microtwin boundary encountered in the penetrated laminate. These\nzones are subject to an extra bending deformation and occasionally to some tip splitting as\nobserved in fig. 5b.\nAs mentioned above, further away from the interface the microtwins are often seen to bend or\nreorient over a distance between 50 and 500 nm on either side, this distance being measured along\nthe microtwin planes. This is clear from the overviews in figs. 6a and 6b. In the first case, a\ndiscrete reorientation is observed at the trace in between the arrows, i.e., further and closer to the\nmacrotwin interface the microtwin planes remain unrotated. In the second case, however, the\nmicrotwin planes are seen to bend gradually when approaching the macrotwin interface. This\nbecomes evident when viewing the image at a grazing incidence along the nearly vertical microtwin\ntraces. Moreover, this bending is in opposite directions in the left and right parts, i.e., at (010)B2\nand (100)B2 type interfaces, respectively. This indicates that this accommodation feature is not only\nrelated to the relative orientations of both plates involved but also to the actual macrotwin plane.\nThe observable curved elongations of the diffraction spots as seen in the selected area electron\ndiffraction (SAED) pattern, obtained from a region with bending microtwins as in fig. 6b, indicate\nthat in such regions the martensite lattice is actually rotated over a few degrees along with the\nbending of the microtwins.\nCloser to the macrotwin interface, i.e., within the 50 nm range again measured along the\nmicrotwin planes, HRTEM images as in fig. 6c reveal a number of near-equidistant atomic scale\nledges (arrows in fig. 6c) shifting the microtwins over one atomic plane. At the same time,\nobserving such lattice images along a grazing incidence parallel with the close packed planes\nshows that these planes are again slightly bent. This can only be confirmed by local power spectra\nin the few cases where good HRTEM images are obtained over a large area. Thus, in these areas at\nleast, the bending is a combined result from microtwin ledges and lattice rotation. In some cases,\npresumably with large local stress accumulation, dislocations are also seen to add to the local\ndeformations, although no direct correlation with the steps could be found.\nThe step type boundary locally involves two microtwin variants in a first plate but only one\nvariant in the second plate and can thus be simplified to the case where one microtwin sequence\nmeets a pure variant. The transition layer that will allow the microtwin sequence to form a coherent\ninterface with the pure variant is restricted to this microtwin sequence while the other sequence\nstays almost unaffected. The orientation difference due to the different rigid body rotations on\nboth sides, is accommodated by a local lattice deformation within this single microtwinned plate.\nThe deformation imposed is thus twice as large as the one required for each plate in the crossing\ntype boundaries and can be explained in terms of a two-dimensional linear thermo-elasticity\ntheory[16].\n6. Discussion\nThe above presented images are only a small sample of the large number of different macrotwin\ninterfaces that have been observed in the different Ni65Al35 samples. Still, the situation where a\nlaminate with U1 broader than U2 meets a laminate with U2 broader than U1 was never observed so\nthe focus will be on those interfaces with the same configuration of microtwin variants in the two\nplates involved. As in fig. 3, in the following discussion the deformation variant U1 will be\nassigned to be the broader one and U2 the smaller one.\nMacrotwin boundaries involving two deformation variants correspond to a situation where the\nangle \u03b1 between the two families of microtwin planes is close to 90\u00b0, i.e., the angle between the\nprior {110} planes in the austenite. As such an interface involves contact regions between variants\nof the same type but with different rigid body rotations implied by their respective choice of\nmicrotwin orientation it cannot be formed as part of an overall energy minimizing configuration\nincluding austenite-martensite interfaces surrounding the entire configuration [6, 13]. By the same\nreasoning, if such plates are forced to make contact because of the nucleation and growth process,\nextra stress accommodating features are expected to be observed.\nAlternatively, it can be shown [17] that if two plates with (110)B2 and (1-10)B2 microtwin planes\nand with the same relative volume fractions for the U1 and U2 variants are compatible over a\nmacrotwin interface, then, assuming a zero-energy continuous deformation, the macrotwin plane\nmust either be a former (100)B2 plane or a former (010)B2 plane. This is an important result as it\nprovides a reason why {100}B2 type interfaces are observed [6, 13]. That this reasoning is not in\ncontradiction with the previously mentioned non-existence of such an overall energy minimizing\nconfiguration, is due to the fact that now only compatibility over the central macrotwin is assumed\nand no surrounding austenite-martensite interfaces are taken into account. The angle between the\nmicrotwin planes for the (100)B2 case is given by 90\u00b0 + \u03b3 - \u03c61, with\ntan ( )\n\u03c6 \u03b7 \u03c1\n\u03b7 \u03c1\n1 3\n12 1\n=\n+\nand for the (010)B2 case by 90\u00b0 - \u03b3 + \u03c62, with\ntan ( )\n\u03c6 \u03b7 \u03c1\n\u03b7 \u03c1\n2 1\n32 1\n=\n\u2212\nwhere\n\u03c1 \u03bb \u03b7 \u03b7\n\u03b7 \u03b7\n=\n\u2212\n+\n3\n2\n1\n2\n3\n2\n1\n2 .\nHere it should be mentioned that the actual calculation leading to the present angles deals with\nrotating lattices which are directly translated into the reorientation of the microtwins involved. This\nis important to note as these calculated values will later on mostly be compared with measurements\nof the angles between traces of the microtwins as in fig. 6b, rather than of lattice images as in fig.\n5. When ledges are involved, as in fig. 6c, this relation cannot be retained completely as low\nmagnification images will show curved microtwins with only minor lattice rotations. The difference\nbetween the values for the (100)B2 versus (010)B2 interface planes is due to the different\norientations of the large (and small) variants with respect to these planes, which can be correlated\nwith the observations of a perpendicular or parallel c-axis, respectively, of the large variant as\ndescribed in \u00a74 and \u00a75.2. In fact, these formulae are the continuum theory based analogues of the\none obtained by Baele et al. for the (010)B2 case in NiMn [18].\nAs already indicated in \u00a74, some distinctions between different cases can be expected based on\nsimple geometric relations. Both cases suggested above, i.e., with the elongation direction of the\nbroadest variant being parallel with or perpendicular to the macrotwin interface, were indeed\nobserved for the crossing type boundaries. As long as the angle between the two families of\nmicrotwin planes is measured outside the stress accommodating region, it is reasonable to suppose\nthat it is due to the original relative orientations of both plates, a feature definitely related with their\nnucleation and growth conditions. In other words, this angle is presumed to be a result of the\noriginal deviation of the microtwin planes in each plate from their prior {110}B2 plane and should\nthus be compared with the calculation for \u03b8. In practice, as the actual rotation axis is not exactly\nparallel with [001]B2 (see \u00a74), the calculated values for \u03b8 have to be transformed into the net angle\n\u03b1 between the normals n of the macrotwin planes before being compared with the experimental\nmeasurements for \u03b1. Knowing the deformation parameters \u03b71 and \u03b73 this angle can thus be\nrigorously calculated as indicated in \u00a74. As was also explained in \u00a74, the rigid body rotation will\nbring the lattices of the largest variants closer to the situation of no rotation, e.g., the rectangle of\nvariant U1 restores its vertical preference. Thus, contacting along the (100)B2 plane produces an\nangle \u03b1 larger than 90\u00b0 whereas a (010)B2 contact plane yields \u03b1 < 90\u00b0. At the same time, the\n(100)B2 contact plane corresponds with a c-axis in U1 being close to perpendicular to the\nmacrotwin interface while the (010)B2 macrotwin has this axis close to parallel with the interface.\nFrom the experimental images in fig. 5 it is indeed seen that \u03b1 > 90\u00b0 (fig. 5b) corresponds with the\nformer while \u03b1 < 90\u00b0 (fig. 5a) with the latter orientation of the U1 c-axis, confirming the conceptual\ndiscussion as well as the rigorous calculation.\nWhen the measurements for the angles between both microtwin families are made at the\ninterface, i.e., within the region accommodating extra deformations, the results should be compared\nwith the calculations involving \u03c61,2. Still, as many different features at different length scales are\nseen to contribute to this accommodation, a straightforward comparison cannot be expected.\nMoreover, accurate calculations are difficult to perform as only the martensite lattice is observed in\nthese samples. As a result, the deformation parameters \u03b71 and \u03b73 can only be obtained from\nmartensite images such as fig. 5 by assuming volume preservation, which is a typical characteristic\nof shape memory material and is indeed the case to within 1% for the present material. The validity\nof the measurement of the deformation parameters under the latter assumption, which yields \u03b71 =\n0.93 and \u03b73 = 1.15, can be checked by comparing the calculated values for the angle \u03b3 and the\nvolume fraction \u03bb measured away from the macrotwin interface. In Table I a comparison between\nmeasured and calculated parameters is presented.\nTable I: calculated and measured microstructural parameters based on deformation\nparameters \u03b71 = 0.93 and \u03b73 = 1.15 measured in the assumption of volume preservation\n\u03b3 \u03bb \u03b8 \u03b1 > 90\u00b0 90\u00b0 + \u03b3 - \u03c61 \u03b1 < 90\u00b0 90\u00b0 - \u03b3 + \u03c62\ncalculated 12.2\u00b0 0.35 2.9\u00b0 93.8\u00b0 92.4\u00b0 86.2\u00b0 85.2\u00b0\nobserved 12.5\u00b0 0.35 - 92\u00b0 - 97\u00b0 90\u00b0 - 95\u00b0 83\u00b0 - 86\u00b0 83\u00b0 - 85\u00b0\nComparing the calculated and observed values for \u03b3 and \u03bb indicates that the assumption of\nvolume preservation is indeed valid. As explained before, the observed value for \u03b1 is measured\nbetween the microtwin orientations far away from the macrotwin interface while the calculated one\noriginates from \u03b8 by taking the deviation of the rotation axis from [001]B2 into account. Although\nthe spread in measured values for \u03b1 is relatively large, the expected order of magnitudes are in\ngood agreement, and the directions of rotation are confirmed (as discussed above). From the\nrespective numerical values for \u03b1 and 90\u00b0 \u00b1 \u03b3 m \u03c61,2 it is predicted that the stress accommodation\nclose to the interface is expected to lead to a smaller deviation from the cubic 90\u00b0 angle for the \u03b1 >\n90\u00b0 case while it yields a larger deviation for the \u03b1 < 90\u00b0 case. However, the calculated differences\nbetween \u03b1 and \u03c61,2 are relatively small, so that one can wonder whether this will have an observable\neffect. Still, as seen from the example in fig. 6b where \u03b1 = 92\u00b0 for the (100)B2 macrotwin and 88\u00b0\nfor the (010)B2 one, this angle is decreased for both macrotwin parts when approaching the\ninterface. This is thus in good agreement with the predicted behaviour based on the continuum\ncalculation for \u03c61,2. The large variation in measured values could possibly be related with the fact\nthat local and possibly dynamic features that are not taken into account by the present model can\nplay an important role in shaping the actual atomic and microstructural features of the macrotwin\ninterfaces. Moreover, when measuring and comparing \u03b1 and 90\u00b0 \u00b1 \u03b3 m \u03c61,2, it is assumed that the\nrotation of the lattice can be measured through the bending of the microtwins, which is\noverestimating the effect of \u03c61,2 as ledges are also observed to play a role in the microtwin bending\n(see fig. 6c). Aside from these stress accommodation features away from and close to the interface,\nthe highly strained tips of the smaller U2 variants as well as the averaged orientation of the U1 parts\nexactly at the macrotwin interface will also accommodate remaining stresses.\nThe difference in bending of the small variant tips as observed in fig. 5 can possibly be\nexplained by referring to the shear directions depicted in figs. 2 and 3. As for the \u03b1 > 90\u00b0 case the\nshearing of the U1 variants is away from the interface it can be understood that this shearing also\npulls the fine needles away from the interface when both transformation fronts cross. On the other\nhand, for the \u03b1 < 90\u00b0 case, the U1 shearing is directed towards the interface thus pushing the\nneedles in the same direction. Both cases perfectly match the observations of fig. 5, which could\nimply that these static observations reveal information on the actual growth directions of the plates.\nThe fact that a single interface can change from \u03b1 < 90\u00b0 to \u03b1 > 90\u00b0 case, as in fig. 4b, does not\nconflict with the above distinction. Indeed, suppose an interface is formed by growth of a small\nplate of type I into the side of a larger plate of type II (e.g., extend plate II to the left in fig. 3 and\nlet plate I touch it at its upper-right habit plane) the upper-left contact will produce an \u03b1 < 90\u00b0\nmacrotwin while the lower-right contact will yield an \u03b1 > 90\u00b0 case.\nThe above discussion is solely based on the observations of the crossing type boundaries. Of\ncourse, as also the step type boundaries consist of two plates with close to perpendicular microtwin\nplanes, the growth and coalescence reasoning for the origin of the interfaces still holds. Moreover,\nin the nanometric scale a single interface often changes from crossing to step type. Overall,\ninterfaces in splat-cooled material seem to accommodate more steps while in bulk material the\npreference is for crossings, which can be related to the general observation that the fixed volume\nfraction and thus the microtwin variant widths are less stable in splat-cooled material [19]. Recent\nTEM results on material obtained by melt-spinning, another rapid quench technique, also reveal a\nlarge number of step configurations at the macrotwin interfaces [20]. The only structural\ndifference which could be detected from the still images of the final situations is the appearance of\nstrong differences in local variant widths at the site of the steps. A detailed study of the local\ndeformations at such steps indicates that in these less symmetric cases the system takes advantage\nof the fact that large contact regions between two variants of the same deformation type can be\navoided [16], which is indeed prohibited in the schemes of the elastic theories [6]. In a more\ngeneral way, this difference could possibly reflect a competition between the elastic and surface\nenergy contributions [21]. In order to avoid such contact regions, needles of the smallest variant\nare formed in one plate, ending at a flat edge of the same variant in the other plate. The choice for\nneedle formation of the smallest variant is understandable as this implies less bending of the\nmicrotwin planes involved. This immediately dictates the type of variant which will form the actual\ninterface as being of the same type. This way the primary contact regions are between U1 of the\nneedle forming plate and U2 of the other plate, a contact which according to theory, can indeed\nprovide energy minimisation [6]. For the latter, however, well defined orientation relations should\nappear which can indeed exist within a given plate but are violated by some degrees when dealing\nwith variants belonging to different plates. In order to compensate for this disadvantage the system\nincludes an extra deformation in the plate containing the needles [16].\nThere remains the question why only configurations with the same deformation variant for the\nwidest twin bands are observed. Again, no definite answer to this question could be found from the\nfinal still images. Still, as the actual environment of a single grain or a set of growing martensite\nplates within a grain is most probably not perfectly isotropic, it could be argued that each austenite\ngrain or each group of plates will (trans)form with a preferential direction for elongation. This\nwould then single out one martensite variant to have a larger fraction within a given region of the\nsample which would imply a higher chance of observing a macrotwin with the same deformation\nvariants for the widest twins on both sides. Alternatively, it can be expected that the elastic energy\nto achieve compatibility for the case of two plates with opposite volume fractions (though still\nsame variants) is higher then for that of two equal fractions, so that the former cases imply the\nformation of even more complex microstructures that are no longer recognised in the TEM images\nas macrotwin boundaries. This is justified in more detail in ref. [22] where the formation of\nmacrotwins with the same families of microtwins in each plate is also found to be less probable on\naccount of the large rotation of the plates required to achive compatibility. On the other hand, the\ndiscrete change in microtwin orientation over a few degrees as seen in fig. 6a, could possibly be an\nexample of the latter situation.\n7. Conclusions\nIn the present work atomic scale details of martensite plate interfaces, so-called macrotwin\nboundaries, in Ni-Al are described and discussed. Only configurations with two families of\nmicrotwin planes at angles close to 90\u00b0 are retained. These are interpreted as being due to the\ncoalescense of separately nucleated and grown martensite plates. Depending on the original\norientation of the distinct plates and the kinetics of the growth, two different configurations are\nobserved. These can be distinguished by the angle between the microtwin planes on either side of\nthe macrotwin interface being larger or smaller than 90\u00b0.\nIrrespective of this angle, two configurations are found differing in local micro- and atomic\nstructure. In the first, the so-called crossing type, a transition region of approximately 5 \u2013 10 nm\nbetween both coalesced plates is observed in which the different rigid body rotations of both plates\nare compensated in a quasi-continuous manner. Small microtwin variants from one plate form\nbending needles tapering towards the perpendicular microtwin interfaces in the other plate, thus\nproducing the crossed view of this type. This case occurs when the microtwin volume fractions on\nboth sides of the macrotwin interface are similar. In the step type, occurring when clear differences\nbetween the microtwin volume fractions on both sides are observed, only one plate forms bending\nneedles which usually do not penetrate into the next plate.\nWhile the described macrotwin configurations hold for both bulk and splat-cooled materials,\nthe only difference which could be made between these materials is the relative amount of step type\nversus crossing type configurations. While a statistical analysis based on HRTEM results is\nhazardous, the step type configurations appear to be more commonly observed in splat-cooled\nmaterial, which is believed to be related to the rapid quench nature of this preparation technique.\nThe observed orientation and measured angles are compared with predictions from thermo-\nelastic continuum theory. A proper correspondence for the relative orientations and the order of\nmagnitude of the angles is obtained. Different stress accommodating features including\ncontinuous as well as discontinuous bending of the microtwins are observed. The need for such\nfeatures and their average effect on the relative orientations is predicted on theoretical grounds. The\nlarge variety in observed structural features and the relatively large spread of experimentally\nmeasured values indicates that local and dynamic features further distort the actual structures.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors like to thank K.
