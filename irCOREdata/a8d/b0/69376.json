Here we \npresent a ~ 5,500 year record of sediment fluxes and sources from Lake \nBassenthwaite utilising magnetic measurements and fuzzy clustering, coupled \nwith independent pollen and archaeological records, to identify the timing and \nimpact of catchment disturbance. This record shows that recent sediment flux \nincreases (i.e., within the last 150 years) are unprecedented in scale throughout \nthe mid-late Holocene and appear to be in response to specific human changes \noccurring within the catchment. Earlier episodes of human activity, from the mid-\nHolocene onwards, show no link with increased lake sediment fluxes, indicating \neither limited catchment impact and\/or \u2018buffering\u2019 through within-catchment \nsediment storage. Increasingly intensive land use and reduction of sediment \nstorage through revetment construction on a key inflow, Newlands Beck, have \nresulted in 3 x increases in lake sediment flux. These data may be significant for \nother upland temperate areas, as   increasing land use pressures and reduced \nsediment storage capacity  may not only increase contemporary sediment flux, \nbut  increase  sensitivity to predicted increases in rainfall and storminess as a \nresult of global warming.  \nIntroduction \n \nLake sediment sequences often comprise important, continuous, natural \narchives, enabling reconstruction of past catchment processes and changes in \nclimatic and environmental conditions. For Holocene sequences, identification of \nthe history of sediment fluxes and sources is a key requirement for evaluating the \nrelative roles of climate- and human-induced forcings in lake sedimentation \nprocesses.  Additionally, if the historical and prehistorical context for modern, \noften accelerated sediment fluxes can be established, the requirement for and \nscale of possible mitigation measures can also be addressed.   Key requirements \nfor studies of lake sediments and flux rates over millennial timescales include \nrobust chronological control, most often sought by radiometric means, especially \n210Pb and 14C (Libby, 1955; Nelson et al., 1977; Appleby and Oldfield 1978; \nOldfield at el., 1980; Oldfield & Appleby, 1984; Oldfield et al., 1997), \nsupplemented by indirect dating proxies, such as palaeomagnetic secular \nvariation (PSV, Turner & Thompson, 1981; Sagnotti et al., 2005), pollen analysis \n(von Post 1946; Pearsall and Pennington, 1947; Birks, 1986), and pollution \nparticles (Locke & Bertine, 1986; Rose & Appleby 2005). Identification of the \nsources of lake sediments, and possible changes in sediment provenance \nthrough time, has been attempted using a diverse range of sediment \n\u2018fingerprinting\u2019 techniques (e.g. Walling et al., 1979; Oldfield et al., 1985; Foster & \nWalling, 1994; Collins and Walling 2002; Bradshaw & Thompson, 1985; Walden \net al., 1997; Kodama et al., 1997; Hatfield & Maher, 2008). In addition to \ninformation characterising the properties of the inorganic components of lake \nsediments, palynological analysis can provide an independent overview of \nchanging lake catchment conditions.  \nInternationally, palaeolimnological research has demonstrated that continuously-\naccreting lake sediment sequences record the sensitivity of many catchments to \npast and present climate and land use pressures (e.g. Davis 1969; Oldfield et al., \n1980; Singh and Geissler, 1985; Renberg, 1990; Zolitschka, 1998; Oldfield et al., \n2003; Lamb et al., 2004; Chiverrell 2006). In the temperate context, Coulthard & \nMacklin (2001) and Foulds & Macklin (2006) suggest that whilst land use change \n(particularly land use intensification) may lead to greater sediment availability, \nHolocene upland river systems are driven primarily by climate change.  However, \nthey additionally note that anthropogenic land use change renders catchments \nmore sensitive to climate change than would otherwise be the case. Current \nclimate change (especially rainfall) projections (e.g. Hulme et al., 2002) indicate \npotentially significant consequences for erosion intensity and changes in \nsediment storage.  Upland areas, with high rainfall, thin soils, and frequently \nintense grazing pressures, are likely to be significantly affected by such changes, \nwith upland lakes also subjected to resultant changes in sediment dynamics and \ndelivery.  \nThe Lake District in the U.K. comprises a spatially dense and interlocking set of \nupland lake-catchment systems, which can provide a regional perspective on the \nimpact of both climatic and anthropogenic land use change on these sensitive \nupland systems. Chiverrell (2006) suggests that there have been three key \nchanges in erosion intensity in the history of the Cumbrian lake systems, at ~ \n5000 years before present (kyr BP), 2.5 kyr BP and 1 kyr BP.  In contrast to \nFoulds & Macklin\u2019s (2006) focus on climate-driven changes in erosivity, Chiverrell \n(2006) links these erosional changes explicitly to anthropogenic land use \nchanges, producing destabilisation of the land surface and increased erodibility.  \nIn order to disentangle the relative impacts of climate and land use changes on \nsediment dynamics in this region, it is necessary to examine the sediment record \nover longer, Holocene timescales, supported by robust chronological control.  \nPresent day problems of accelerated lake sediment fluxes also require evaluation \nover both the historical and pre-historical timescale, in order to assess their \nrelative significance compared with the \u2018natural\u2019 post-glacial evolution of the lake.  \nHere, we examine the sedimentation history and dynamics for Bassenthwaite \nLake, designated a Site of Special Scientific Importance but presently subjected \nto fluxes of phosphorus and fine sediment, associated with eutrophication and \nloss of spawning habitat for the rare fish, the vendace (Winfield et al, 2004).   \nThe 240km2 catchment of Bassenthwaite Lake, situated in the north of the Lake \nDistrict National Park, encompasses three river systems, and the lakes, Derwent \nWater and Thirlmere (figure 1). Catchment geology is dominated by the Skiddaw \nSlate Group, with rolling moorland fells in the north and east dominating the River \nDerwent and Chapel Beck sub-catchments, in contrast with the more \nmountainous and hydrologically \u2018flashy\u2019 Newlands sub-catchment to the south-\nwest. Much of the catchment exceeds 250 m altitude and is designated \u2018upland\u2019 \nand \u2018seriously disadvantaged\u2019 (DEFRA, 2008) in terms of its agricultural \nproduction, climate, soils and relief. Present day land use is dominated by \npastoral farming in the valley bottoms, concentrated in riparian areas.  \nAdditionally, several large forest plantations exist both adjacent to and south of \nthe lake. Settlements are tightly clustered between Derwent Water and \nBassenthwaite with Keswick (pop. ~ 5,000) the major urban centre within the \ncatchment, which supports a total population of around 7,000 (National Statistics, \n2008), rising with summer visitors to 11,000. Historically, land-use has included \nsignificant mining of lead, copper and baryte, initiated as late as the early \nnineteenth century in the previously unexploited Newlands (\u2018new lands\u2019) Valley.  \nHowever, only ~4 % of the present catchment retains any native forest cover, \nand evidence for human activity from Neolithic times (e.g. Castlerigg stone circle) \nindicates a long history of land-use change in the Bassenthwaite catchment. \nSignificant increases in lake sediment flux within the last 200 years have been \nidentified from analysis of a 1-metre\/~2,000 year record of sedimentation in \nBassenthwaite (Hatfield et al., in press).  These recent increases have been \ncausally linked with mining activity and deforestation in the late 19th century, and \nincreased winter rainfall in the early 21st century.  However, as noted by \nChiverrell (2006), other lakes in the region appear to have recorded significant \ncatchment and climate changes from the early Holocene onwards.  Here, we \nexamine a longer sediment sequence obtained from Bassenthwaite Lake, to \nidentify rates and sources of sediment flux, and changes in the pollen record \nfrom the catchment, through the Holocene.  This longer record should enable \nidentification of the relative impacts of climate- and land use-related forcings on \nsediment dynamics in the Bassenthwaite Lake and catchment.  \n \nMethodology  \n \nLake sediment coring and sample preparation \n \nLake sediment mini-cores obtained previously (Hatfield et al., in press) indicate \nlowest lake sedimentation rates in the deepest part of the Bassenthwaite basin. \nThus, to obtain the longest sediment time series, two 3-meter cores (BASS 8 and \n9) were recovered using a Mackereth corer (December 2004), from the deep \nbasin, adjacent to a previous mini-core, BASS 5, a 1-metre core dated using \n210Pb methods (Hatfield et al., in press). On return to the laboratory, the cores \nwere opened using a circular saw to cut the plastic liner, producing two \nundisturbed core halves. One half of each core was sampled into two 1.5 m u-\ntube channels for palaeomagnetic analyses.  The remaining half of BASS8 was \nsampled continuously at 2 cm intervals, for mineral magnetic analysis of \nindividual sediment samples. These single samples were then split into five \nparticle size fractions, first by wet sieving at 63 \u03bcm, and subsequent separation of \nthe 31-63 \u03bcm, 8-31 \u03bcm, 2-8 \u03bcm and <2 \u03bcm fractions by settling in Atterberg \ncolumns. The magnetic properties of the medium silt-sized fraction (31-63 \u03bcm) \nprovide effective means of discrimination between potential catchment sediment \nsources at the present day (Hatfield & Maher, 2008).  Use of this size fraction for \nsediment sourcing also precludes any confounding influence of possible \nauthigenic, bacterial magnetite phases (Hatfield & Maher, 2008; Hatfield et al., in \npress).  For direct comparability, the majority of magnetic measurements \nreported here were performed on this size fraction. The sized samples were dried \novernight at 40 \u00b0C and immobilised in 10 cc plastic pots prior to magnetic \nanalysis. \n \nPalaeomagnetic and mineral magnetic measurements  \n \nU-channels taken from the undisturbed half of each sediment core (2 x 1.5 m u-\nchannel lengths per core) were analysed using a pull-through Superconducting \nQUantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometer at the National \nOceanography Centre in Southampton. The cores were scanned at 1 cm \nresolution to measure their natural remanent magnetisation (NRM) intensity, \nmagnetic declination and inclination.  Stepwise alternating field (AF) \ndemagnetisation of the NRM was performed, at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60 \nand 80 milliTesla (mT).  The sediments were then subjected to acquisition of an \nanhysteretic remanence (ARM), in a peak AF of 90 mT with a biasing field of \n0.05 mT.  In turn, this artificial remanence was stepwise AF demagnetised at 10, \n20, 25, 30, 40 and 60 mT.  A \u2018saturation\u2019 remanence (SIRM) was then imparted, \nusing a DC field of 900mT, again with subsequent AF demagnetisation (using the \nsame fields as for the ARM demagnetisation process). All measurements are \nexpressed in volumetric units (m A-1).  As the cores are unorientated, magnetic \ndeclination values were transformed into arbitrary values about 0\u00b0 (using the \nmethodology of Turner and Thompson, 1981).  Data obtained from 5 cm above \nand below the ends of each u-channel section were removed from the \nremanence datasets to avoid edge effects in the measurement process and any \npost-sampling sediment expansion\/deformation.  \nFor the single sediment samples, room temperature magnetic measurements \nincluded low field, initial magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7lf), susceptibility of anhysteretic \nremanence (\u03c7ARM, i.e. the ARM normalised by the DC bias field) and stepwise \nacquisition and demagnetisation of isothermal remanent magnetisation (IRM). \nMagnetic susceptibility was measured at 0.47 kHz on a Bartington MS2B \nsusceptibility sensor. The ARM was imparted using a Molspin demagnetiser with \nARM attachment in a peak ac field of 80 mT, with a superimposed D.C. biasing \nfield of 0.08 mT. IRM acquisition was incrementally imparted in D.C. fields of 20, \n40, 50, 100, 200 and 300 mT, using a Molspin pulse magnetiser, and at 500, 700 \nand 1000 mT (regarded as the saturating field), using a Newport electromagnet. \nBetween the IRM acquisition steps at 100 mT and 700 mT, samples were \ndemagnetised in a tumbling ac field of 100 mT, in order to discriminate between \nmaghemite, haematite and goethite, all of which are capable of high-field IRM \nacquisition but with differing degrees of magnetic stability (Liu et al., 2002; Maher \net al., 2004). The SIRM was stepwise AF demagnetised in fields of 5, 10, 15, 20, \n30, 40, 80 and 100 mT. All remanence measurements were made on a Molspin \nMinispin fluxgate magnetometer (noise level ~ 5 x 10-8 Am-1) and all data are \nexpressed on a mass-normalised basis. From these measurements, several \nconcentration-independent, inter-parametric ratios were also calculated. All \nmagnetic measurements were made at the Centre for Environmental Magnetism \nand Palaeomagnetism (CEMP) at the Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster \nUniversity.  Subsequently, statistical matching of the lake sediment samples \nagainst potential source materials (Hatfield and Maher, 2008), on the basis of \nfour independent magnetic parameters, was performed using fuzzy cluster \nanalysis.  The fuzzy analysis enables the degree of affinity between a sample \nand all other clusters to be estimated, rather than the categorical assignment of \nsamples to one cluster, as in conventional hierarchal cluster analysis. \n \nRadiometric dating \n \nFourteen bulk sediment samples from BASS 8 were 14C-dated, using accelerator \nmass spectrometry methods, at Lund University, Sweden. Dates were calibrated \nusing atmospheric data from Reimer (2004) and OxCAL v3.10 (Bronk Ramsey, \n2005) and a weighted average based on the probability distribution functions of \ncalibrated age ranges was used to obtain best estimates of each date\u2019s central \npoint (Telford, 2004).  The base of adjacent mini-core BASS 5 (64 cm below lake \nfloor) was also 14C-dated at Lund, at 2,605 calendar years BP. \n  \nPollen Analysis \n \nStandard preparation techniques (acetolysis and hydrofluoric acid treatment) \nwere applied to samples at ~ 10 cm intervals through the BASS 8 sediments, in \norder to concentrate the constituent pollen grains. A minimum sum of 300 pollen \ngrains was counted for each sample interval (Gilbert, 2008). \n \nResults \n \nAge Control \n \nFor robustness, palaeomagnetic dating of sediments using palaeosecular \nvariation (PSV) should be based on at least two records from the same sequence \n(e.g. Turner and Thompson, 1981; Sagnotti et al., 2005). The palaeomagnetic \ndata from the upper 1.5 m of the two 3-m Bassenthwaite cores, BASS 8 and 9  \nsuggest that a single dominant ferrimagnetic component is responsible for their \nNRM, all Zjiderveld plots displaying linear demagnetisation trajectories which \ntrend towards the origin. Below ~ 1.5 m depth, magnetic inclination shallows \nsignificantly and physical disturbance of the palaeomagnetic directions appears \nlikely to have occurred.  Figure 2a shows the correlated magnetic inclination \nrecords, af demagnetised at 30mT, for BASS 8 and BASS 9, together with the \nWindermere master curve (Turner and Thompson, 1981), supported by the 14 \n14C dates as independent tie-points. The palaeomagnetic correlation between \nBASS 8 and 9 is supported by the down-core variations in SIRM and ARM \n(figures 2b and 2c). Relative \u2018lock-in\u2019 depths of the palaeomagnetic signal \n(Sagnotti et al., 2005) vary only slightly between the cores (ranging from -5 to 4 \ncm) resulting from slightly differing sedimentation rates.  These two sediment \ncores thus appear to provide a representative record of sedimentation in the \ndeep basin of Bassenthwaite Lake.  Hatfield et al. (in press) recovered several 1-\nm cores from Bassenthwaite, all of which display distinctively high values of \nSIRM and susceptibility at between ~ 15 and 45 cm depth (210Pb-dated to ~ \n1960).  These distinctive magnetic peaks are absent from BASS 8 and 9, \nsuggesting that the most recent sediments are missing from both 3-m cores. The \ntop of BASS 8 correlates with the base of mini-core BASS 5 on the basis of 2 14C \ndates and the distinctive dominant presence of the diatom taxa, Cyclotella \ncomensis and Cyclotella bodanica. To obtain the most complete and continuous \nsediment record for the lake so far, BASS 5, the longest of the 1-m mini-core \nrecords, can thus be superimposed on the 3-m BASS 8 core (figures 3a and 3b). \nBASS 8 was selected due to its slightly higher sedimentation rate and better \nresolved PSV, SIRM and ARM records. The BASS 8 PSV record deteriorates at \n> 1.36 m depth; below this, the 14C dates also show greater spread and possibly \nindicate incorporation of\/contamination by younger carbon at depth (figure 3c). \nGiven that errors from the 14C reservoir effect potentially exceed those from the \nPSV-based record, the age model for the lower part of BASS 8 is derived from \nextrapolation of the relatively constant linear sedimentation rate occurring \nbetween 0.8 and 1.36 m in the PSV record (figure 3c). This PSV-based model \nbisects the scattered radiocarbon dates at the base of the core. Comparison of \nthese fitted BASS 8 age\/depth profiles with the adjacent BASS 5 mini-core record \nindicates they have comparable accumulation rates (0.05 cm yr-1) prior to the last \n~ 500 years (figure 3d). By integrating the higher resolution mini-core record of \nrecent sedimentation and the multi-millennial long core record, we can thus \nexamine sediment dynamics over the last ~ 5,500 years of Bassenthwaite Lake\u2019s \nexistence.  \n \nSediment Physical Properties \n \nFigure 4 shows the percentage change of the clay and coarse silt fractions with \nsediment depth in the integrated BASS 8\/BASS 5 core record. From ~ 5.5 kyr BP \nto 4.8 kyr BP, the sediment particle size distribution is relatively fine and varies \nlittle.  From ~ 4.8 kyr BP, particle size becomes more variable and from 4.2 kyr \nBP distinct fining occurs, illustrated by a ~15 % increase in the proportion of clay. \nAround 3.8 kyr BP, particle size becomes less variable, with a relatively fine size \ndistribution maintained for ~1 kyr before progressive coarsening of the sediment \nensues. At ~ 2.1 kyr BP (i.e. the correlation point between the BASS 5 mini-core \nand the BASS 8 3 m core), particle size variations in both cores are small and \ncomparable. Subsequent coarsening of the lake sediment occurs, with a peak at \n~ 1.5 kyr BP, with increases of 5 % and 10 % in the coarse and medium silt \nfractions, respectively. Significant particle size changes occur again during the \nlast 50 years. Figure 3d shows the sediment accumulation rate based on the \nintegrated 210Pb- and PSV-based age\/depth reconstruction shown in figure 3c. \nIncreases in sediment flux (up to 0.2 cm yr-1) are recorded at ~ 4 kyr BP, 3.4 kyr \nBP and 2.5 kyr BP.  However, these are small in magnitude compared with the \nhighest sediment flux values (up to 0.6 cm yr-1) which occur in three distinct \n\u2018pulses\u2019 within the last ~ 150 years (Hatfield et al., in press; Bennion et al., 2000).  \n \nMagnetic Properties \n \nThe majority of the Bassenthwaite Lake sediments are dominated magnetically \nby ferrimagnetic minerals (magnetite and maghemite), as shown by \ncharacteristically steep IRM acquisition curves, with 82 % (\u00b12% as 1 std dev.) of \nthe SIRM attained at 100 mT. However, higher coercivity magnetic components \nare also present, as indicated by ~ 18 % remanence acquisition in applied fields \n> 300 mT.  Some of this higher field remanence may be attributable to \nmaghemite which, although ferrimagnetic, can acquire remanence at such fields \n(but this remanence is completely unstable when subjected to af \ndemagnetisation, Liu et al., 2002; Maher et al., 2004). Some 68 % (+ 8% as 1 \ns.d.) of the HIRM1-0.1 T is lost upon 100mT a.f. demagnetisation.  The remaining, \nstable high-field remanence reflects the presence of goethite or haematite. \nBased on the stable HIRM component, the haematite content of the sediments is \n~ 0.043 %, with a ferrimagnetic concentration (probably magnetite) of ~ 0.016 % \nestimated from the soft remanence (IRM 100mT). Although there is almost 3 x the \nconcentration of haematite to magnetite in the samples, the sediment magnetic \nproperties are dominated by the ferrimagnetic contributions.  \nFigure 5 shows the integrated down-core profile of concentration-dependant and \nratio magnetic parameters for the Bassenthwaite Lake record. The concentration-\ndependant parameters, \u03c7lf and SIRM, show similar variations, with low and \ndeclining values from the basal sediments up to ~ 2 kyr BP, when values \nstabilise.  Only from the 19th century onwards do sharp maxima in \u03c7lf and SIRM \noccur. The \u03c7ARM behaviour differs from that of \u03c7lf  and SIRM.  Maximum \u03c7ARM \nvalues are recorded between 5 kyr BP and 3.5 kyr BP,  falling to minimum values \naround 2.5 kyr BP. Relatively low \u03c7ARM values then persist before increases \ntowards the core top, in similar fashion to \u03c7lf and SIRM. The inter-parametric \nratios (e.g. IRM100mT\/SIRM, \u03c7ARM\/\u03c7lf, \u03c7ARM\/SIRM, MDFIRM and SIRM-100mT a.f. (%)) \nare independent of magnetic concentration.  They reflect changes in the \nmineralogy and grain size of the sediment magnetic minerals. Two major periods \nof change are shown by these parameters.  First, from 5 \u2013 3.5 kyr BP, \u03c7ARM\/ \u03c7lf \nand \u03c7ARM\/SIRM reach maximum values and MDFIRM increases, suggesting the \npresence of finer and harder magnetic minerals.  Second, within the last 500 \nyears, values of \u03c7ARM\/ \u03c7lf and \u03c7ARM\/SIRM decrease, presaging the major changes \nin all magnetic parameters at ~ 150 years BP (Hatfield et al., in press).   \nAt the present day, suspended sediments transported to Bassenthwaite Lake by \nthe Derwent and Newlands Beck can be differentiated on the basis of their \nmagnetic and elemental properties (Hatfield & Maher, 2008).  If it is assumed that \nthese inflows and sources have also been operative in the past, then their \nrelative contribution to the 5.5 kyr-long lake sediment record can be estimated, \nfrom statistical matching of the sediments with these sources.  Fuzzy cluster \nanalysis returns no \u2018unclassified\u2019 samples (suggesting the absence of any \u2018non-\nanalogue\u2019 sources in the record). The Derwent is identified as the dominant \nsource of the lake sediment from 4.5 kyr to 0.5 kyr BP (figure 6), in association \nwith relatively low values of sediment flux (estimated from Xlf, e.g. Thompson and \nOldfield, 1986; Dearing 1999, Hatfield et al., in press).  In contrast, Newlands \nBeck is the major sediment source from 5.6 kyr to 4.5 kyr, and again from 300 yr \nto present, and appears to be associated with the highest sediment fluxes \nrecorded from the mid-Holocene onwards. \n \nPollen Record \n \nPercentage pollen counts representing the major vegetation classes are \npresented in figure 7. Based on the arboreal\/non-arboreal pollen ratio and % \nchanges in some indicator species, six local pollen zones (LPZ) can be defined \nfor the Bassenthwaite sediment record. LPZ1 (5.6 \u2013 4.8 kyr BP) is dominated by \ndeciduous trees, with total arboreal pollen (AP) ~ 70-80 % and Quercus (oak), \nAlnus (alder), Corylus (hazel) and Betula (beech) the most common species. \nLPZ2 (4.8 \u2013 4.0 kyr BP) shows declines in oak and beech, accompanied by \nincreases in alder, Poaceae (grasses) and Pteropsida (ferns). LPZ3 (4.0 \u2013 2.5 \nkyr BP) is characterised by a further decline in AP (particularly oak) and \nestablishment of more permanent grassland in the catchment. LPZ4 (2.5 kyr \u2013 \n1.5 kyr BP) shows increases in grasses and herbs, particularly Plantago \nlanceolota and P. spathulata and an increase in Erica (heather). LPZ6 (300 BP \u2013 \npresent) is characterised by large increases in herbs and grasses, further \ndeclines in oak and beech, and increases in Pinus (pine) and Alnus (alder) \n Archaeological Finds \n \nEvidence for evolving human occupation and land use change in the \nBassenthwaite catchment during the mid- to late-Holocene is provided by records \nof archaeological finds (figure 8).  Whilst it should be noted that absence of finds \ndoes not necessarily indicate absence of activity, these data can be used to map \nhuman activity and occupation in certain periods (as defined by the \nArchaeological Data Service). For the Bassenthwaite catchment, the earliest \nevidence (prehistoric, Mesolithic and Neolithic) is concentrated in the flat valley \nbottoms around what is now Keswick and St John\u2019s in the Vale, and adjacent to \nthe three lakes (figure 8a). Evidence for later finds, from the Bronze and Iron \nAges (figure 8b), show greater spread, with first evidence for activity both at \nhigher altitudes and more distal locations.  The Romans greatly developed the \nGreta and Glenderamackin valleys (figure 8c), following the earlier concentrated \nactivity within these areas. Notably, there are few pre-medieval finds in the \nNewlands valley; much of the development here is confined to much later, \nmedieval and post-medieval periods.  \n  \nDiscussion \n \nChanges in the rate of sediment flux, sediment physical and magnetic properties \nand in pollen assemblages through the sedimentary record of Bassenthwaite \nLake reflect changes in climatic and\/or land-use forcing mechanisms.  The \nobserved changes in sediment particle size (figure 4), for example, could arise \nfrom changes in energy in the system (see synchronicity evident in figures 4 and \n6c), and\/or in supply of sediment either from the catchment or from within-lake \nredistribution processes. Here, the multiproxy sediment data can be used to \nevaluate the respective roles of climate and human activity in changing the \nsediment dynamics of the lake over the last ~ 5.5 kyrs. \nLPZ 1, ~ 5.6 \u2013 4.8 kyr BP: The pollen record indicates dominant mixed deciduous \nwoodland cover in the lake catchment, with alder carr probably prevalent on the \npoorly-drained valley floors and lower floodplains, oak more dominant on the \nbetter drained foothills and shallow slopes. Fluctuating AP percentages (between \n60 and 80 %), together with low concentrations of herbaceous species (Plantago, \nRumex and Filipendula) indicate early if restricted human activity, supported by \nprehistoric and Meso- and Neolithic archaeological evidence (e.g. construction of \nCastlerigg stone circle date at ~5 kyr BP). From the magnetic data, rates of \nsediment flux to the lake are low.  Around 5.0 \u2013 4.8 kyr BP, in association with \nrelatively warm and wet climate conditions (fig. 6b and c), slight increases in \nSIRM and \u03c7LF occur, associated with the Newlands valley source, and the \nparticle size of the lake sediments coarsens slightly.  Inwash of \u2018old\u2019 carbon, \nindicated by reversals in the 14C dates, may also have occurred.  Although it is \nclear that the Newlands valley did not undergo significant development until \nrelatively very late, its steep terrain is likely to have been more susceptible to \nflashy storm run-off, and efficient sediment delivery compared with the more \nundulating Derwent sub-catchment. Thus, slightly enhanced storm activity may \nbe responsible for these minor changes in lake sediment source and flux at a \ntime when human catchment disturbance and sediment flux were generally low. \nLPZ2, ~ 4.8 \u2013 4.0 kyr BP: For this time interval, the lake edges, floodplains, flat \nvalley floors and lower slopes are where the majority of early archaeological finds \nhave been found (figure 8a). Decreases in AP percentages (particularly oak) \nbetween 4.8 and 4.2 kyr BP reflect increased human activity and forest \nclearance, with the archaeology indicating most activity within the more \naccessible Derwent sub-catchment. Climatic and vegetation conditions in the \nmid-Holocene were likely to have been favourable for magnetic enhancement in \ncambisols (Maher, 1998; Maher et al., 2003); increased topsoil erosion linked to \ndeforestation episodes may explain increased fining of the lake\u2019s magnetic \nminerals at this time, and evident in the coarse silt fraction possibly due to \nincomplete particle size separation (e.g. Sartori et al., 2005). The magnetic \nproperties of the lake sediments display statistical affinity with the Derwent rather \nthan Newlands Beck at this time (figure 6a) reflecting the uneven concentration \nof human activity. Towards the end of LPZ2 (~4.0 kyr BP), forest regeneration is \nevident,, as humans dispersed away from the lake edges and along the Greta \nand St. John\u2019s valleys. Rates of sediment flux at this time are low, indicating little \nimpact of the climatic decline (from ~ 5 to ~ 2 kyr BP) following the mid-Holocene \n\u2018optimum\u2019, associated with a fall in annual average temperature and increased \nrainfall, as shown by a number of UK records (e.g. figures 6b and 6c; Chambers \net al., 1997; Langdon and Barber, 2005; Dalton et al., 2005; Langdon et al., \n2004; Coulthard and Macklin, 2001).   \nLPZ3, ~ 4.0 \u2013 2.8 kyr BP: Bronze Age settlements around Threlkeld and more \nsubstantial earthworks in St. John\u2019s in the Vale indicate increasing human \noccupation concentrated along the Greta and Glenderamackin river valleys \n(ADS, 2008), associated with pollen evidence of increased deforestation and \nmore sustained establishment of semi-permanent grassland. Sediment flux \nincreased, with contributions from the Derwent peaking at ~ 3.8 kyr BP. From this \ntime, significant changes occur in lake sediment properties, with decreases in all \nmagnetic concentration parameters and clastic coarsening.  This may reflect \nincreases in subsoil (rather than topsoil) erosion and\/or increased frequency of \nsediment suspension events, possibly including increased sediment redistribution \nfrom the shallow to the deeper areas of the lake (Hatfield et al., in press).  \nDespite evidence for increased catchment disturbance, sediment flux rates to the \ndeep basin remain low, suggesting storage of sediment storage elsewhere \n(floodplains, shallow lake areas). \nAt the present day, the Derwent floodplain and aggrading delta are large \nsediment stores, and much of Bassenthwaite, especially close to the Derwent \ninflow, is < 5 m in depth (in contrast to the deep westerly basin, > 20 m depth).  \nIncreased local deposition may have reduced the apparent flux of Derwent-\nsourced sediment to the deeper basin.  In contrast with LPZ1, there is little \nevidence of Newlands-sourced sediments in the deep basin at this time.   \nLPZ4,, 2.8 \u2013 1.5 kyr BP: Increases in the catchment\u2019s population and settled \nagriculture are indicated by the archaeological finds from the late Iron Age and \nRomano-British period and increasing pollen percentages of Plantago and \nRumex, especially from ~ 2.5 kyr BP. Evidence exists for Roman roads along the \nGlenderamackin river valley and around Braithwaite, with extensive fort and \nsettlement developments around Troutbeck, Threlkeld and Keswick (ADS, 2008). \nA second major decline in oak pollen indicates renewed and substantial \ndeforestation, possibly on the shallower slopes of the Newlands valley. Increased \narchaeological finds (ADS, 2008) and an interval of increased lake sediment flux \nfrom the Newlands valley appears to support this.  However, rates of sediment \nflux decrease almost immediately and the Derwent is reinstalled as the major \nlake sediment source. Roman occupation significantly impacted vegetation \nand\/or erosional flux in many Lake District catchments (Oldfield, 1963; Wimble et \nal., 2000; Chiverrell, 2006). Bassenthwaite shows relatively little response \ndespite evidence of significant catchment disturbance concentrated in the Greta \nand Glenderamackin river valleys. This again suggests significant sediment \nstorage, especially within the Derwent sub-catchment. \nLPZ 5, ~ 1.5 \u2013 0.3 kyr BP: Most of the archaeological finds in the Newlands sub-\ncatchment date from medieval and post-medieval times (ADS, 2008). Despite \nonset of these late changes in the Newlands valley, the Derwent remained the \nmain sediment source through most of this time interval. More intense post-\nmedieval activity was initiated through mining, first of copper and then, much \nlater, of lead (Postlethwaite, 1913).  Increased pollen percentages of Erica \nindicate higher proportions of moorland development, coupled with conversion of \nheath at lower altitudes to pasture for sheep grazing, particularly in riparian \nareas. Sediment fluxes show little increase at this time, however. \nLPZ 6, ~ 300 years BP \u2013 Present: Increasing land use pressures, particularly in \nthe Newlands valley, appear associated with major changes in the sediment \nregime within this time period. Doubling of herb and grass pollen percentages \nand a further 10 % reduction in AP indicate increased deforestation, large-scale \nestablishment of pasture, and increasingly intensive pastoralism as the dominant \nland use in the upland areas. When upland vegetation cover is converted from \nrelatively deep-rooted woodland and ferns to shallow-rooted pasture, markedly \nincreased rates of soil erosion result (Wilmshurst, 1997; Wilmshurst & McGlone \n2005). A first \u2018pulse\u2019 of increased lake sediment flux at Bassenthwaite is evident \nat ~ 500 yrs BP, and a second at ~ 300 yrs BP.  However, the most dramatic \nincreases (> x 3) in sediment flux occur at ~ 150 yrs BP, dominated by \nNewlands-sourced material. In addition to these intensified agricultural activities, \nmining and deforestation in the Newlands valley in the 18th and 19th centuries \nappear to have resulted in major erosional activity and sediment delivery to the \nlake.  Not only is sediment supply likely to have been increased but also \nsediment delivery, since artificial straightening and river bank revetment along \nthe Newlands Beck was undertaken during and post \u2013 World War 2.  Another \nmajor \u2018pulse\u2019 of sediment flux coincides with renewed farming intensification \nduring the 1960s.  Most recently (and ongoing), a further interval of increased \nsediment flux, again Newlands-sourced, has been initiated within the last ~ 10 \nyears.  \n \nImplications for upland catchments \n \nEvidence from these multiproxy records indicates a stepwise increase in human \nimpacts on sediment dynamics in the Bassenthwaite catchment only within the \nlast 150 years, despite pollen and archaeological evidence for human activity and \noccupation through the last ~ 5.5 kyrs. Either this activity was insufficient to alter \ncatchment sediment dynamics and\/or sediment storage and redistribution has \nuntil recently \u2018buffered\u2019 sediment influx to the deep lake basin. Any such buffers \nappear to have been exceeded by recent, intense land use and river channel \nchanges in the Newlands catchment. The combination of increased sediment \nsupply and decreased sediment storage (on floodplains and in channels) has \nresulted in rapid and ongoing acceleration of sediment influx to the lake. Given \npredictions and observations of increased rainfall and storm intensity linked to \nglobal warming (Hulme et al., 2002; Malby et al., 2007), the ecological status of \nLake Bassenthwaite, already progressing towards eutrophy (Bennion et al., \n2000), is likely to deteriorate further and rapidly, unless accelerated sediment \nsupply is mitigated (e.g. by land use change, such as reafforestation) and \nsediment storage capacity restored (e.g. by restoration of river channels). \n \n \nConclusions \n \n\u2022 From the mid-Holocene onwards, sedimentation rates at Lake \nBassenthwaite have been low (~ 0.05 cm\/yr), despite increased rainfall \nand slightly declining temperatures.  Catchment disturbance by human \nactivity has been relatively limited and late. Newlands Beck-sourced \nsediment dominated the early part (5.5 \u2013 4.5 kyr BP) of the deep lake \nbasin record.  Sediment source then shifted to the River Derwent, with \nsediment accumulation rates of ~ 0.05 - 0.1 cm\/yr from ~ 4.5 kyr BP, until \nthe last ~ 500 years when Newlands sources became dominant, in \nassociation with major (> 3 x) increases in sedimentation rate.  \n\u2022 Pollen analysis, allied with published archaeological finds data, indicates \nincreasing human activity and environmental impact from the mid-\nHolocene onwards but increases in rates of sedimentation only occur in \nrecent times, particularly reflecting the late and intense land use changes \nin the Newlands Beck subcatchment.  \n\u2022 Sediment storage processes are important in the Bassenthwaite \ncatchment, with Derwent-sourced sediment probably preferentially \ndeposited in the shallower areas of the lake, especially at the aggrading \npro-Derwent delta.  \n\u2022 Increased land-use intensification in the Newlands Valley over the last ~ \n500 years, coupled with increasing channalisation of Newlands Beck, has \nincreased sedimentation rates and reduced sediment storage on the \nfloodplain. \n\u2022 Factors controlling lake sediment distribution, supply and floodplain \nstorage each contribute to the Bassenthwaite lake sediment record, with \nthe deep lake basin most sensitive to changes in sediment flux from the \nNewlands valley. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis research was supported by a Lancaster University 40th Anniversary \nstudentship to RH.
