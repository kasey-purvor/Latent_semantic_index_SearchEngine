More recently, a number of academics and practitioners have \nvoiced concerns over the evident gap between how such concepts are viewed in theory and \nhow they are applied in practice. These issues have already been raised in academic papers, \nbut almost entirely at an abstract level. This paper introduces a more concrete aspect to the \ndebate by proposing a series of organisational archetypes which illustrate how organisations \nmay segment their markets in practice. These archetypes are developed from a series of mini-\ncase studies which provide a basis for understanding how organisations may interface with \nthe market at both an explicit and implicit level. The implications for both academic research \nand organisational practice are reviewed and discussed \nBackground \nThe activity of marketing and the concept of the market are inextricably linked. If an \norganisation is to enjoy any level of marketing success, this is through an ability to match its \nown capabilities to the requirements of the market place. Central to this matching process is \nthe segmentation of the market. Wendell Smith [1] is widely cited as providing the basis for \nthe concept of market segmentation as it is applied today. An overview of the literature on \nmarket segmentation underlines the view that markets, and their segments, are clusters of \npotential customers (e.g. Kotler, [2]; Tynan & Drayton, [3]).  Wind [4] summarises market \nsegmentation as a proactive process (managers purposefully identify segments) involving the \napplication of analytic techniques to identify these segments: \n2 \n\"Realising the potential benefits of market segmentation requires both \nmanagerial acceptance of the concept and an empirical segmentation study \nbefore segmentation can begin.\" \nThe basic premise of market segmentation is that a heterogeneous group of customers can be \ngrouped into homogenous clusters or segments, each requiring differing applications of the \nmarketing mix to service their needs. The focus of research and discussion has therefore been \nconcerned with the analytical approaches by which homogenous clusters can be established \nfrom a heterogeneous sample: \n\"The largest problem is how to subdivide the market.\" \nMoriarty & Reibstein [5] \nThis emphasis on the analytic basis for segmentation has been widely applied to both \nconsumer [6, 7, 8, 9] and industrial markets [10, 11, 12, 13, 14,15]. \nTheory versus Practice \nHowever, this approach assumes segments to be objective, identifiable entities which are 'out \nthere' available to all managers and organisations. In addition, there is the assumption that \nsegmentation is a process which managers undertake explicitly to maximise their market \neffectiveness. These assumptions can be challenged on two levels. Firstly, such approaches to \nsegmentation take no explicit account of organisational capabilities or structure, which is in \ncontrast to studies concerning the business or market definition.  At a strategic level, market \ndefinition and segmentation become more closely linked to the capabilities and nature of the \norganisation.  Abell [16] uses three dimensions for defining and segmenting the markets in \nwhich an organisation operates: customer group; customer function; and technology.  Day \n[17] identifies strategic definitions of markets as being concerned with competitive capability \nand resource transferability. If the broad market definition requires an understanding of the \norganisation's capabilities, then should this not also be reflected in the definition of market \nsegments? Secondly, segmentation may also be viewed as a perspective, a way of seeing the \n3 \nmarket space, as opposed to a proactive process requiring empirical analysis.  In this regard \norganisations can be said to implicitly segment the market into various groups as a way of \n'making sense' of their environment. \nConventional segmentation theory has, therefore, been founded on conceptual, rather than \nempirical evidence, based on how organisations should segment their markets, rather than \nconsidering how they actually construct homogeneity in the market place. Such frameworks \nare of undoubted value, but have been criticised for failing to consider the practical issues of \nhow these concepts are implemented in practice within organisations [18]. One potential \nreason for the evident gap between theory and practice is the prescriptive and analytical \napproach taken in the literature. A counter-view is expressed by Knight [19] who, as a \npractising marketing consultant, considers that the market definition of many organisations is \noften a function of internal factors such as organisational culture and processes: \n\"The idea of markets should be a construct which enables us to simplify and \ntherefore observe and predict consumer behaviour. The practice, however, too \noften reflects the company's internal issues and history.\" \nKnight [19: pp.17] \nIn a wider sense these issues reflect the problem that, in practice, organisational theories are \nnot implemented in ways which reflect the objective assumptions of the literature. In the \ncontext of strategic management, the rational planning approach for representing strategy has \nbeen challenged as a basis for understanding what actually happens in organisations [20, 21]. \nSuch concerns have led to the adoption of research approaches which attempt to understand \nhow the organisation and its managers implicitly make sense of their strategic environment \n[22]. Broadly termed interpretative research, these studies have found empirical evidence that \nmanagers are highly subjective in strategy formulation [23, 24] and in the way in which they \ninterpret their external environments [25, 26, 27]. The relevance of such research to this issue \nis to suggest that market segments can be viewed, not only as explicit, objective entities, but \nalso as implicit and subjective concepts which are as much a creation of the organisation as \n4 \nthey are of the external environment.  This suggests that much of the research has taken a \nfunctionalist perspective [28].  The functional paradigm emphasises objectivity, regarding \nreality as a concrete structure which is 'discovered' by the researcher.  The functionalist \nperspective is generally considered to be the dominant basis for undertaking management \nresearch.  The issue raised suggests that a subjective and relative emphasis may also provide \na contribution to understanding the segmentation process. \nA number of researchers have attempted to gain further understanding of some of these \nissues. In a study of 190 businesses, Day & Nedungadi [29] found that managers held quite \ndiffering orientations as to how they perceived their competitive position.  These were found \nto focus on customers, competitors, markets or internal factors. Jenkins et al [30] found that \nmany managers defined and segmented their markets on the basis of internal products rather \nthan external customer groupings. This study also revealed a high degree of variability in the \nsubjective views of these managers. \nPiercy and Morgan [31] provide a conceptual framework for viewing market segmentation \nwhich acknowledges the distinction between explicit and implicit aspects of the market. An \nexplicit perspective refers to the traditional marketing theorists' view that markets are \"out \nthere\" and are essentially groups of customers. The implicit perspective relates to the role of \ncognitions, culture, processes and structure in determining the organisation's view of the \nmarket. Whilst this framework has not been developed from empirical sources, it does \nprovide an intuitive basis for understanding how markets may be defined and segmented in \npractice. A major contribution of Piercy and Morgan's [31] framework is to suggest that \nimplicit aspects of market segments may play a far more significant role in defining and \nsegmenting the market place than is currently considered in the marketing literature. \nThe implicit aspects of segmentation are important for two reasons. Firstly, at an \nimplementation level, conventional frameworks for understanding segmentation tend to \nignore the capability of an organisation to implement a marketing strategy within a particular \nsegment.  Wind [4] provides a list of twelve key areas for future research, one of which is the \n5 \nrelationship between organisational structure and the success of implementing particular \nsegmentation strategies.  Seventeen years later this topic remains unexplored and researchers \nhave tended to assume that the challenge in market segmentation is to find new analytic \napproaches to subdividing the market, rather than addressing the effective implementation of \nmarket segmentation. Secondly, there is the issue of market drift. If implicit issues are \ndominant in the definition and segmentation of markets, the organisation may be unable to \nrecognise changes in the market place which may ultimately undermine their entire \nmarketing strategy. This second factor is, in effect, a form of marketing myopia reflecting the \nphenomena which Levitt [32] observed more than thirty years ago. \nA number of issues emanate from these conclusions. Firstly, there is a lack of research which \nattempts to understand how organisations actually arrive at and sustain particular market \nsegments. Secondly, there are no established frameworks for understanding the differing \nways in which organisations may divide up and respond to their market place.  It is our view \nthat these issues are substantive and provide an important gap in the current research on \nmarketing management. It is the purpose of this study to provide a contribution toward \nresolving these important questions. The lack of research is, partly, a reflection on the lack of \nviable frameworks and theories to understand how organisations may actually view their \nmarket place. By assessing a number of organisations on the basis of the explicit\/implicit \nconstruct suggested by Piercy & Morgan [31], it is intended to create a series of archetypes \nwhich represent differing approaches and emphasis in segmenting the market place. It is \nintended that the creation of these archetypes will extend and clarify the discussion as to how \norganisations actually relate to their target markets and the potential implications of these \ndiffering positions. \n6 \nA Case Study Approach \nIn order to develop a clearer picture as to how differing approaches to explicit and implicit \nsegmentation may appear in organisations, a case study approach is adopted. It should be \nstressed that the role of case studies in this paper, is not empirical but illustrative.  It is \nintended to clarify some of the ideas which have been raised in conceptual terms within the \nmarketing literature. \nThis study describes a series of marketing based projects undertaken by the authors with a \nseries of large organisations. The process followed is to record a series of observations or \ncommentaries on particular organisational situations.  In all cases, the researchers are \ninvolved over a number of years in development programmes and in consultancy in each of \nthe organisations cited here. The sample frame is, therefore, driven by convenience and \nopportunity in order to provide the necessary insights from both primary sources and \npublished information.  These data are then brought together to provide an account of the \norganisational approach to segmentation.  These interpretations are necessarily subjective and \nare designed to provide the clarity of an organisational context when considering approaches \nto segmentation.  The data presented are anecdotal and brought together in a loose, but \nconsidered framework.  The purpose of the framework being to distil the key elements which \ndifferentiate the way in which these organisations relate to their market segments. The result \nof these groupings is to suggest four particular archetypes representing how organisations \nsegment their markets. These archetypes are exemplified with four actual organisations. \nThe International Airline \nMany commentators agree that the major international airlines of today have achieved their \ncurrent size primarily through one of the following three routes: \n1. The sheer size and wealth of their home market, e.g. United Airlines. \n7 \n2. Dogged determination by their home country to have a major carrier operating in the \nindustry, e.g.  Singapore Airlines. \n3. They are the national airline of a former colonial power, e.g. British Airways. \nHowever, regardless of their country of origin these airlines have all, on the whole, \nsegmented their global market on the basis of geographic territories. \nBefore the development of products and brands in British Airways, the airline's marketing \nwas driven by powerful territorial line managers.  Country Managers reported to Regional \nManagers who, in turn, reported through their Route General Managers based at the \ncompany's headquarters at Heathrow Airport in London. The only exception was the 'Country \nManager' for the UK who, simply because of the size of revenue generated in the UK, was \nequivalent in status to a Route General Manager. These individuals were responsible for \ngenerating the bulk of the airline's revenue, other revenue coming from the sale of in-house \ntour operations and third party activities. \n'Marketing' could be found on individual office doors in Route head offices, regional offices \nand in many of the country offices, and the Route General Managers, along with the General \nManager UK Sales, reported to a marketing director. The focus of marketing was territorial, \nand although the airline discussed its markets in terms of 'Business', 'Leisure' and 'Visiting \nFriends and Relatives' (VFR), even, at times, having campaigns focused into these travel \nsectors, marketing expenditure budgets were set by territory and were often judged in terms \nof the revenue generated by that territory. Revenue performance for the Route General \nManagers was, however, judged by both territory and by route, with route revenue coming \nfrom all over the world. A prime function for the routes was, therefore, the allocation of seats \nand cargo space to the different territorial markets around the world. Revenue per seat was, \nhowever, the major determinant by which a territory was given capacity to sell on any flight, \nthough, in some instances, it was accepted that a minimum number of seats or amount of \ncargo space had to be made available for sale in certain territories in order to retain a \n'presence' in that area. Obtaining such capacity was, however particularly difficult on services \n8 \noperated by a Route Division other than the one in which a Territory Manager was \ngeographically located, an exception being a situation where the Territory Manager had \ncapacity which the Route Manager wanted, which could then be used for leverage in \nnegotiations. \nWith an aircraft fleet and cabin crew traversing all geographical boundaries, product design \nwas primarily a corporate task and was kept fairly simple by looking at the world in terms of \nFirst Class travel and Economy class travel. Schedules were rarely designed around customer \nrequirements and were governed by: \n1. The drive to keep aircraft in the air for as much time as possible, as this was when \n they were earning revenue. \n2. Night time restrictions at airports. \n3. Agreements between governments and airlines themselves. \nTweaking of the in-flight offer was, however, available to the Route offices. They could \nrequest menus to suit the palates of the geographical areas the aircraft flew through, and they \ncould employ extra cabin crew members from their overseas territories to bring a 'local \nflavour' to their services for the indigenous traveller. Essentially, however, the company was \nsales orientated, the emphasis being to fill capacity and thereby requiring seats to be sold.  \nCustomers were those who happened to sit in the seats.  There was no strategic perspective as \nto how particular groups of customers should be managed. \nThe Chemical Company \nIn 1917, the British Government bought a site in Billingham on the north bank of the River \nTees for a factory to make synthetic ammonia, 'Synthonia', as a first stage for producing the \nchemicals for munitions. After the war, in 1919, Brunner Mond and Company took over the \nsite to make fertilisers from ammonia using the same process as originally intended in the \nGovernment plan. \n9 \nIt was not until 1923 that the first ammonia plant started production and by the following \nyear the first nitrogen product, Sulphate of Ammonia, was manufactured. This was followed \nfive years later by another nitrogen fertiliser product, 'Nitro Chalk', which was particularly \nsuited to grassland. Nitrogen, however, is not the only element likely to be depleted in the \nsoil on commercial farms. Phosphate and potash are two further important soil nutrients that \nneed topping up on these farms, and by 1930 the company was producing 'complete' \nfertilisers containing nitrogen, phosphate and potash in a compound form. This extension of \nthe product range suited the company, as it meant its nitrogen was being used in a greater \nnumber of products. \nUsage of fertilisers tends to fall into three distinct product groups - straight nitrogen, nitrogen \nwith phosphate and potash, and a third group consisting of just phosphate and potash. To \nensure the company had a complete range, products containing phosphate and potash were \nalso sold, primarily because it was believed that offering the full range pulled through sales \nof the separate product lines (later proved to be largely a myth). The principle focus of the \nbusiness was, however, around the ammonia production technology. This was the most \ncomplex chemical process for the fertiliser business, and the company's greatest margin came \nfrom products containing the most nitrogen. The production of compounds was fairly simple \nin comparison (once the nitrogen had been produced) and was carried out in a separate plant \non the site. \nGiven the origin of the business, the source of its margins and distinct manufacturing plants, \nit could only appear logical to structure the management of the business and its information \nflows around the three product lines. This is exactly what happened and the three product \nlines were represented in the marketing function by product managers. The product \nmanagement teams not only liaised with the manufacturing plant on product specifications \nand production volumes, they also drove the promotional campaigns of the business and set \nthe sales targets, though only for their products. This was perfectly acceptable, of course, \nbecause the market, on the whole, bought these three product types at different times of the \nyear. \n10 \nIt was readily accepted in the company that, broadly speaking, the market was split between \nfertilisers for the growing of grass and fertilisers for the growing of arable crops. There were \neven products specifically manufactured for each of these two sectors, distinct services \noffered to each of them, and dedicated specialist advisers based at headquarters. Despite this, \nthe thrust of the business was based around product lines, each of which eventually fell under \nthe control of its own Business Team. Lying over this split was the sales force, divided, for \nmanagement purposes, into geographical territories. Their sales targets were, as already \nmentioned, presented to them along product lines, and any sales support literature was \nsimilarly divided, as all the budgets were allocated along product lines. This organisational \nstructure has been in place for over sixty years. \nThe Bank \nSome years ago, the Customer Service Representative of one of the big five banks was being \ninterviewed on the radio. The main area of discussion centred around opening times and the \nlimited number of tellers on duty during the peak, lunch-time period. The reason given for \nthe opening times was that the public forgot that the transactions which the bank undertook \non their behalf took time, and if they were open to the public 9. a.m. to 5.30 p.m. during the \nweek, never mind at weekends, the staff at the bank would probably need to work from 8. \na.m. to 7. p.m.. The bank's public hours were the most it could offer when their staff worked \n9. a.m. to 5.30 p.m., which seemed fair, of course, because these were the hours worked by \nmost of their customers! With regard to the lunch-time queues, the reasons for this were \nequally straight-forward and reasonable. The bank's tellers also had to have lunch breaks! \nThese issues, rather than humbling the customer into acceptance, fuelled the growth of the \nbuilding societies. 'Marketing' arrived in the financial world in a big way during the 1980s \nand attractive salaries and extra financial benefits attracted some of the best. They had found \na gold mine waiting to be developed. Unlike many businesses, banks clearly know who their \ncustomers are.  The switching costs for these customers is high when compared to other \nindustries.  This means that banks have traditionally enjoyed a high level of customer \n11 \nretention.  Here, therefore, was a great opportunity for developing financial products and \nselling the variety of services available from the bank into a known customer base. Here, \nalso, was the opportunity to develop products suited to the different stages of life and \nprogressively put them in front of the customer as they travelled through life's highway. \nThe large, in-house data bases could also be profiled by matching them up against externally \nheld databases containing psychographic information. This would help in the better targeting \nof new product offers into the banks' own customer base, and enable the banks to specify \ntarget customer profiles from externally held lists when prospecting for new customers. \nInevitably complex segmentation structures were devised and numerous new products \ndeveloped, and the banks became portrayed more as centres for financial services. \nHowever, the purpose of these segments was to find ways of selling internally or \ncompetitively defined products, these segments being variable according to the different \nprojects for which they were devised. The majority of banks still opened at the times the \ncustomers were in work and the tellers still went to lunch during the peak period. If anyone \nwanted to talk about any of the new services, the unmanned enquiry desk always had a \nwelcome to them, once someone had responded to the bell! \nThe Burton Group \nDespite its recent turbulent history, largely related to the tabloid-hitting headlines of a past \nchairman, excessive compensation packages for senior managers and the financial drain of an \nunfortunate foray into property development, the Burton Group is a prime example of an \norganisation that has structured itself around its chosen segments. \nThe different high street brands of the Group such as Evans, Top Shop, and Principles are \ntargeted into specific segments and are not just fronts. Behind each lies a complete \ninfrastructure with its own marketing group, buyers, financial controllers, administration and \nso on, all focused into the survival of the brand in its segment. Each brand is responsible for \n12 \nits own survival, which is determined by the brand's ability to keep pace with the evolving \nneeds of its target segment. Admittedly, some brands appear to be tiring, but this is due, in \npart, to the restricted capital investment programmes the company has had to live with, as \nwell as 'time out' being called on the segment. At the same time, however, their financial \nsqueeze has not stopped the introduction of new brands to exploit the opportunities available \nin newly emerging segments, such as, for example 'is', launched in 1992. \nDiscussion \nThese cases are presented as illustrations of the potential alignment of the organisation to \nmarket segments. They are subjective accounts drawn from the researchers' contact with, and \nknowledge of these organisations.  The purpose of presenting these mini-cases is to \ndetermine how they may clarify and extend our understanding of segmentation processes.  In \nThe International Airline, segmentation is driven by internal structures and processes. The \npower of the territory manager defines the way the organisation aligns itself to the market. \nThis perspective does not begin with the customer, but with the structure of the sales \norganisation. This view of the market is also limited to particular functions and activities \nwithin the organisation and does not appear to operate across functions or at a strategic level. \nIn contrast, The Chemical Company represents an organisation whose entire structure and \nmode of operation represents a particular view of the market. This view is clearly process or \nproduct led and is not a customer driven view of the market place. In contrast to The \nInternational Airline it is a view which is embedded throughout the organisation. \nThe Bank presents a different type of situation. Here, the organisation has a customer based \napproach as to how it segments the market place. This view is, however, restricted to the \nfunctional marketing activities of the organisation. It does not permeate the way the \norganisation, as a whole, sees the external world and does not appear to influence many of \nthe processes and procedures which do impact on the customer. \n13 \nThe Burton Group provides an organisational view which is centred on customer groups. \nThis form of segmentation is deeply embedded in the operations and perspective of the \nemployees as it forms the basis for the organisational structure. \nAll of the above examples reflect differing approaches as to how an organisation may align \nitself to the segments within the market place. The purpose of the case studies has been to \nillustrate potential divergence which differentiate these examples. The constructs which \nexplain this divergence may provide further insights into the process aspects of how different \norganisations may segment their markets. It is suggested that there are two principle \ndimensions which differentiate between these examples. \nCustomer Driven \nThe examples of The Bank and the Burton Group are both approaches which are clearly \ncentred on the customer. In these situations, a market and its segments are clearly customer \ngroups as defined by Kotler [2] and others. In the case of The Bank, the customer focus is \nlimited to particular initiatives which are task and function specific. In the case of The Burton \nGroup, customer focus permeates and defines the separate business units. In contrast, the \napproach taken by The International Airline and The Chemical Company is not centred on \nthe customer. This is not to imply that at some point in time they were not customer driven. \nThe issue is that these approaches for defining and segmenting the market no longer begin \nwith the customer. They have become internalised and are thereby driven by internal factors \nsuch as sales force territories, budgets and organisational structures. These are implicit views \nof the market place which have become part of the organisation's culture and perspective on \nits environment. \n14 \nOrganisational Integration \nThe International Airline and The Bank both exhibit low levels of organisational integration.  \nThe way in which the market is segmented is the domain of particular groups, or functions \nwithin the organisation. In these situations, segmentation is very much an operational, as \nopposed to a strategic process. It is concerned with a particular media campaign or for \nestablishing particular sales objectives. Outside these particular groups, these segments are \nnot understood or recognised.  In contrast, The Chemical Company and The Burton Group \nboth illustrate a high level of organisational integration. In these situations, segmentation is \nnot just a way of targeting potential customers, but an intrinsic part of the structure and \nculture of the organisation. All parts of the organisation recognise that the market is \nsegmented in this particular way, these segments providing a strategic basis for how the \norganisation understands its interaction with the business environment. \n \nClassifying Market Segmentation in Organisations \nThese two constructs for considering the organisational aspects of segmentation; customer \ndriven and organisational integration, can be incorporated into a matrix (Figure 1). This \nmatrix provides a basis for discriminating between the segmentation process in the \norganisations illustrated in the four case studies. \n \nInsert Figure 1 about here \nFigure 1: Market Segmentation Archetypes \n \nThe first cell, Sales Based Segmentation, describes an organisational archetype where the \nmarket is segmented on the basis of sales areas or structures, which do not necessarily reflect \nclusters of particular customer characteristics or needs. In addition, these approaches are \nrelatively superficial, and they are not embedded in the way the organisation, as a whole, is \nstructured, or the way it operates. This archetype represents segmentation which is driven by, \n15 \nand is largely exclusive to, the sales operations of an organisation. The International Airline \nis taken as an exemplar of this particular archetype. Here, the approach to segmentation \noperates at a territory level where some adjustment of the offer is permitted (use of local \nmenus and cabin staff). However, this view of the market is not embedded in the way the \norganisation is driven as a whole. The organisational priorities are represented by the need to \nmaximise the capacity of the fleet of aircraft and the fact that this capacity resource is \nallocated through the management of routes rather than particular territories. The \nInternational Airline, therefore, provides an example of an approach to segmentation which is \ninternally (sales territories), as opposed to being externally (customer) driven and which does \nnot reflect the priorities and focus of the organisation as a whole. \nThe second cell, Structural Segmentation, represents a further archetype where there is little \nemphasis on segments as groups of customers. Segments are defined by sales areas or \nstructures. However, in contrast to the sales based archetype, this approach to the market is \ndeeply embedded in the organisation as a whole. The Chemical Company provides an \nexemplar of this situation. The organisation described in this case uses product management \nteams, who are responsible for marketing activity at both the strategic and operational levels. \nThese groups are also working with sales territories which are allocated on a geographic \nbasis. At this level, therefore, the segmentation is not explicitly customer driven, although the \nsales territories may reflect differing patterns of agriculture, and the different product types \nmay be applied at different times of the year. However, the product divisions which are \nfronted by the product management teams are embedded in the structure and nature of the \norganisation. The requirements of a complex and capital intensive process (producing \nnitrogen from ammonia) has meant that the product divisions which represent differing \naspects of this process are highly integrated into the fabric of the organisation. This cell, \ntherefore, presents an approach which is both production and sales driven and which is \nembedded in all the structures and processes of the organisation. \nThe third cell, Bolt on Segmentation, presents an archetype where a high level of customer \nfocus is brought into the defining of market segments. In this case, the organisation applies \ncustomer data which is often available within the organisation, such as location, purchase \n16 \npatterns and product preference. These data are combined with external classification systems \nsuch as ACORN or MOSAIC which align the customer base to particular socio-economic \nprofiles. In contrast to the previous archetypes, this segmentation approach is driven by the \ninformation held on the customer base as opposed to the structure of sales operations. \nHowever, this archetype is close to Sales Based Segmentation, as it is limited to a number of \nfunctional areas within the organisation and is not integrated into the organisation as a whole. \nIn this case, the purpose of the segmentation exercise is to assist in selling existing products \nand targeting advertising campaigns, which are essentially operational, as opposed to \nstrategic issues. In this archetype the segmentation framework does not guide new product \ndevelopment, nor does it affect the core processes and power base of the business. The Bank \nis presented as an exemplar of this particular archetype. In this example, a high level of \ncustomer information already exists within the business. In many situations this is applied \nsimply to target mail shots or other promotions, aimed at selling existing products. These \nsegments do not provide a focus for redefining the business processes, a basis for new service \nconcepts or the removal of existing products. A customer focus exists, but this does not \npermeate the whole operation of the business, as it is not considered at a strategic level. \nThe fourth cell, Strategic Segmentation, combines both a customer focus and a high level of \norganisational integration. In this cell, the organisation is able to apply customer based data \nin order to develop a set of defined segments. In contrast to the Bolt on Segmentation \napproach, the organisation has integrated these segments across the key functional activities. \nThey provide a basis, not only for the promotional activity, but also for strategic decision \nmaking and internal marketing; in the case of the latter, this clarity of particular market \nsegments provide a powerful basis for bringing the customer into the organisation [32]. They \nalso provide a focus for the entire processes and operations of the organisation on these \nmarket segments. The Burton Group is suggested as an exemplar for this cell. The Burton \nGroup have a set of retailing concepts which are driven by clearly defined market segments. \nThese segments have been defined around customer groups, but are also deeply embedded in \nthe organisation through their own operations and processes, which are tailored to the needs \n17 \nof their respective segments. In this case, all those in the organisation can picture the target \nsegment and have a basic appreciation of how the segment can be most effectively served. \nImplications for the Research Agenda \nThe purpose of this study has been to introduce a series of concrete examples into the largely \nconceptual discussion on market segmentation. In doing so, a number of questions are raised \nas to the status and implications of the framework shown in Figure 1. Firstly, there is an \nimplication that all organisations should aim to be in the Strategic Segmentation cell. It must \nsurely be better to be more customer focused and organisationally committed to a particular \nform of segmentation?  Our position is that this framework is a working hypothesis which is \nexploratory and descriptive, rather than diagnostic and prescriptive. It should not, therefore, \nbe assumed that certain cells are more desirable than others, in spite of what subsequently \nhappened to the organisations in question.  The airline concerned made massive losses for a \nsustained period and was eventually acquired.  The international chemical company sustained \nsuch crippling losses during the late 1980s that it, too, was forced to close.  Likewise, banks \nmade substantial losses.  Nonetheless, the aim of this framework is merely to provide a basis \nfor beginning to assess segmentation, not only as an external clustering of customers, but also \nin terms of the strategic and internal implications for an organisation.  \nThe first section of this paper raised a number of issues concerning the existing published \nwork on segmentation.  The dominant perspective in segmentation research has been to \nextend and develop the work of the analysis of market segments, the implication being that \nmore complex analysis will provide more effective segmentation.  This paper has clarified, \nthrough four organisational archetypes, the potential for integrating organisational \ncharacteristics as a component part of segment definition.  This extends the strategic work of \nAbell [16] and Day [17] to consider segmentation in a similar light to market definition.  It \nalso explicitly raises the question of the link between organisational structure and the way the \norganisation relates to the market place.  These issues generate research questions relating to \nthe responsiveness and commitment of organisations relating to specific segments of the \nmarket. \n18 \nThe contribution of these archetypes is to emphasise two central dimensions in the \nsegmentation process:  the level of customer focus and the level of organisational integration.  \nThis redirects attention away from the need to establish ever-more complex forms of analysis \nto a consideration of the linkage between customer groups and organisational capabilities.  \nThe role of the archetypes has been to clarify the potential variation in the linkage between \nthe organisational and the market place.  This linkage is central to many of the popular \nthemes in the marketing literature as identified by Piercy [32].  Themes such as relationship \nmarketing, pursuit of excellence and market-driven processes, are all concerned with \nmanaging the linkage between the organisation and market segments. \nThe research agenda which emerges from the discussion is one which embraces the \ndevelopment of a social sciences approach to segmentation.  The linkage between segments \nserved and organisational configuration and sense making is the basis for this agenda.  It is \nsuggested that key elements of such an agenda could be identified as follows:- \n\u2022 Market segmentation as a function of organisational configuration. \n The link between strategy and structure has been well considered in the literature.  \nThe implications of the structural segmentation archetype is that the link between \nsegments and structure may also be an insightful perspective in explaining \nperformance and adaption to the market. \n\u2022 Market segmentation as a function of organisational culture and 'mindset'. \n The idea that markets and segments are 'enacted' by the organisation has already been \nraised.  But how do cultures sustain segments and thereby potentially create inertia to \nchange. \n\u2022 Market segmentation as a function of industry culture and 'mindset'. \n This study has considered one case in four, quite distinct industries.  This question \nconcerns whether there is an industry mindset which creates segments.  Perhaps this is \ndetermined by the way in which industry data is gathered rather than identifying \nhomogeneous groups of customer needs.  What is the impact of the organisation who \nredefines the segments?  For example, British Airways segmenting business travel in \nthe 1980s. \n19 \nIntertwined with these agendas, of course, is the ubiquitous issue of their relationship with \norganisational success and there remains the possibility of exploring the proposed archetypes \nin the context of universally-recognised excellent companies [33]. \nThese key areas suggest that segmentation research needs (as in the case here) to be \nexploratory rather than prescriptive.  Many questions remain from the consideration of these \narchetypes which need to be explored empirically in order to clarify the nature of the linkage \nbetween the organisation and market segments. \nThe role of industry characteristics and life cycle stages may have major implications for \nparticular approaches to segmentation. The lack of a customer focus in the examples of the \nAirline and the Chemical Company is not necessarily an artefact of inept management, but \nmay be driven by the capital intensity of the processes and operations, as a required priority \nat a particular stage in the industry life cycle.  The role of these archetypes may, therefore, be \nspecific to particular industries where relative positions can be assessed in the context of \nindustry structure and stage in the life cycle. \nA further issue is that the nature of environmental dynamics and organisational change may \nre-focus this analysis to movement around the framework, as opposed to the consideration of \nstatic positions. Market segments are not clearly defined and fixed entities.  The automobile \nmarket was traditionally segmented on the basis of engine size, which was considered to \napproximate to particular customer groups. This is no longer the case. Many manufacturers \nare now taking a concept-based approach to new product development in order to meet the \nneeds of more specific segments.  A new model, whilst maintaining the same mechanical \nlayout, may have many different body styles to target differing segments of the market.  \nDibb & Simkin [15] refer to the problems of inertia in trying to change an established and \ncomfortable view of segmentation to one which is more customer focused in the industrial \nequipment after-market. The ability of an organisation to move through the various \narchetypes may be central to their reconfiguration in response to environmental change. One \npotential problem for the Strategic Segmentation and Structural Segmentation archetypes \nmay be the difficulty of changing embedded organisations and systems quickly enough to \nmatch new developments in customer demand. In contrast, this may be a strength in the other \n20 \narchetypes, where a superficial and potentially temporary approach might permit quicker \norganisational change in response to changes in the market place. \nThis study has attempted to refocus segmentation theory to account for the implicit and \norganisational aspects of market segmentation. Piercy & Morgan [30] suggest that the current \ntheories of segmentation (if they are indeed theories) need to be developed into a broad \nresearch agenda which encompasses the wider area of organisation sense making. This paper \nis intended to provide a contribution to this re-orientation. By acknowledging the inherently \ninternal realities concerning the processes of how organisations segment their markets, it is \nhoped that researchers can begin to close the gap between theory and practice in this \nfundamental area of marketing. \n21 \nReferences \n1.
