Introduction\nThe selection of the few sharpest images from a large\ndataset of short exposures provides one method of obtain-\ning high resolution images through atmospheric seeing at\nground-based telescopes. The selected exposures can then\nbe processed using one of the conventional speckle tech-\nniques such as shift-and-add. Exposure selection has been\napplied in many studies of the solar surface and for plane-\ntary imaging but has not been extensively tested as a gen-\neral tool for astronomical imaging at optical wavelengths.\nTrials by Dantowitz (1998) and Dantowitz et al. (2000)\nusing a video camera on the 60-inch Mt.Wilson telescope\nhave shown its promise for reaching close to the di\u000braction\nlimit. In view of the technical di\u000eculties of adaptive op-\ntics at wavelengths shorter than 1 \u0016m, it seems important\nto assess this alternative technique quantitatively. In this\npaper we present such observations, showing the power\nof the method and argue that new developments in low-\nnoise, fast-readout CCD\u2019s make it attractive for achiev-\ning di\u000braction-limited imaging in the visible waveband for\nfaint astronomical targets using apertures of about 2.5 m.\nSend o\u000bprint requests to: R. N. Tubbs,\ne-mail: rnt20@ast.cam.ac.uk\nThe basis for the method is that the atmosphere be-\nhaves as a time-varying random phase screen, with a\npower spectrum of irregularities characterised by spatial\nand temporal scales r0 and t0, whose rms variations are\nlarger than those of a well-adjusted and \fgured primary\nmirror. Occasionally the combined phase variations across\nthe telescope aperture, \u000e, due to the atmosphere and mir-\nror, will be small (<\u0018 1 radian). The corresponding image\nof a star will have a core which is di\u000braction-limited with a\nStrehl ratio of exp (\u2212\u000e2) and angular resolution 1:22\u0015=D\ndetermined by the aperture diameter D. Fried (1978) cal-\nculated the probability, P , of \\lucky exposures\" having\nphase variations less than 1 radian across an aperture\ndiameter D for seeing de\fned by r0:\nP \u2019 5:6 exp\n\u0010\n\u22120:1557 (D=r0)2\n\u0011\n:\nThis implies, for instance, that for an aperture D = 7r0,\none exposure in 350 would have a Strehl ratio greater than\n0.37. For D = 10r0, the frequency of such good exposures\nfalls to only one in 106. This suggests that values of D\nchosen as 7r0 may o\u000ber the best compromise between high\nangular resolution and frequency of occurrence.\nThe technique evidently requires a site with good see-\ning and a telescope for which it is known that the er-\nrors in the mirror \fgure are small compared with the\nL2 J. E. Baldwin et al.: Di\u000braction-limited imaging with the NOT\natmospheric fluctuations on all relevant scales. The pri-\nmary mirror should ideally match the maximum useful\naperture for this technique. If very good seeing is taken\nto be 0.5 arcsec, and a useful aperture as 7r0, then D\nshould be 1.4 m at 500 nm and 2.5 m at 800 nm. The\nNordic Optical Telescope (NOT) matches these criteria\nvery closely.\n2. Observations and data reduction\nObservations were made at the Cassegrain focus of\nthe NOT on the nights of 2000 May 12 and 13. The\ncamera was one developed for the JOSE programme\nof seeing evaluation at the William Herschel Telescope\n(St-Jacques et al. 1997). It comprised a 512 \u0002 512 front\nilluminated frame-transfer CCD with 15 \u0016m pixels run by\nan AstroCam 4100 controller. The controller allows win-\ndowing of the area of readout and variable pixel readout\nrates up to 5.5 MHz. The f\/11 beam at the focus was\nconverted to f\/30 using a single achromat to give an im-\nage scale of 41 milliarcsec\/pixel (25 pixels\/arcsec). This\ngives a good match to the full width to half maximum\n(FWHM) of the di\u000braction-limited image of 66 milliarcsec\nfor a 2.56 m telescope with 0.50 m secondary obstruction\nat 800 nm; good signal-to-noise sensitivity per pixel is re-\ntained whilst the resolution is degraded only slightly to\n77 milliarcsec FWHM by the \fnite pixel size.\nA \flter centred at 810 nm with a bandwidth of 120 nm\nwas used to de\fne the band. All of the exposures of stars\nwere taken at frame rates higher than 150 Hz and without\nautoguiding to ensure that the temporal behaviour of the\nperiods of good seeing was adequately characterised.\nObservations of the stars listed in Table 1 were made\nwith a variety of frame formats and frame rates. Each run\ntypically comprised between 5000 and 24 000 frames over\na period of 30{160 s. Target stars, both single stars and\nbinaries, were chosen principally lying in the declination\nrange 10\u000e{20\u000e and close to the meridian, so that most\nof the data was taken at zenith angles <20\u000e. Zenith an-\ngles up to 50\u000e were explored in later observations. The\ne\u000bects of atmospheric dispersion became signi\fcant, since\nno corrective optics were employed. The seeing was good,\ntypically 0.5 arcsec (see Table 1), and the short exposure\nimages seen in real time clearly showed a single bright\nspeckle at some instants. The full aperture of the NOT\nwas therefore used for all the observations on both nights.\nThe analysis of the data was carried out in stages:\n1. Some runs in which the detector was saturated dur-\ning the periods of best seeing and a small number of\nmisrecorded frames in runs taken at the fastest frame\nrates were excluded from further analysis;\n2. For each run, an averaged image was obtained by sum-\nming all the remaining frames. The mean sky level was\nmeasured from a suitable area of the image and sub-\ntracted before determining the FWHM of the seeing\ndisk (Table 1) and the total stellar flux;\nTable 1.

Each frame was interpolated to give a factor of 4 times\nas many pixels in each coordinate using sinc interpola-\ntion to overcome problems of sampling in the images;\n4. The peak brightness and position of the brightest pixel\nin each frame was measured and stored;\n5. The Strehl ratio for each frame was derived using the\npeak brightness above the sky level measured for that\nframe, scaled by the total flux from the star and a\ngeometrical factor which relates the pixel scale to the\ntheoretical di\u000braction response of the NOT;\n6. A \\good\" image was then obtained by taking only\nthose frames with a Strehl ratio greater than some cho-\nsen value, shifting the images so that the peak pixels\nwere superposed and adding the frames.\nFigure 1 shows a histogram of the Strehl ratios derived fol-\nlowing 1-5 above for individual 5.4 ms exposures in a 32 s\nrun on the star \u000f Aquilae. The substantial improvement\nin the Strehl of the shift-and-add image and in limiting\nsensitivity provided by image selection is clear from the\nspread of the Strehl values. For comparison, a histogram\nis also plotted of the Strehl ratios obtained for images\nfrom simulations of 10 000 realisations of atmospheric ir-\nregularities with a Kolmogorov turbulent spectrum over a\ncircular aperture 6:5r0 in diameter. The close agreement\nbetween theory and observation suggests that the condi-\ntions corresponded to 6:5r0 = 2.56 m at 810 nm for this\nrun. The FWHM of the averaged image from this run was\n0.4 arcsec, corresponding to the telescope aperture being\nonly 5:8r0 for a Kolmogorov spectrum of turbulence. The\ndiscrepancy is partly explained by the actual image mo-\ntion being only 60% of that for a Kolmogorov spectrum,\nimplying an outer scale of turbulence of about 30 m.\nThe timescale on which changes take place in the best\nimages is an important question, setting a limit to the\nmaximum frame exposure time which can be used in this\ntechnique, and hence to the faintest limiting magnitude\nJ.

The dotted\ncurve shows the measured distribution of Strehl ratios for the\nindividual exposures. The solid line is for a computer simu-\nlation of Kolmogorov turbulence with an aperture diameter\nof 6:5r0. The dot-dashed curve shows the Strehl ratios which\nresult after averaging together groups of \fve consecutive ex-\nposures of \u000f Aquilae without correction for image motion. If\ngroups of 20 consecutive exposures are averaged together the\nresulting images typically have substantially lower Strehl ratios\n(dashed line). For this case only one of the averaged images\ngives a Strehl greater than 0.25\nachievable with a given camera. Histograms of the Strehl\nratios obtained after averaging together groups of 5 suc-\ncessive frames without correction for image motion are\nincluded in Fig. 1. This shows that exposures as long as\n30 ms could be used with only a small reduction in the\nobserved Strehl values. The Strehls are reduced substan-\ntially if 20 exposures are averaged together. The choice of\nbest exposure time depends on the intended application.\n3. Results\nData from the run on \u000f Aquilae analysed in several dif-\nferent ways illustrate the possible strategies in practice.\nFigure 2a shows a 108 ms exposure, formed by the summa-\ntion without shifting of 20 consecutive 5.4 ms exposures,\nduring a single period of good atmospheric conditions. The\nFWHM of the central core in the image is 79\u000295 milliarc-\nsec, with a Strehl ratio of 0.29. Figure 2b was constructed\nfrom 12 exposures of 27 ms duration, each made by sum-\nming without shifting \fve 5.4 ms exposures. These 12 ex-\nposures were shifted and added to give a \fnal FWHM of\n81\u000296 milliarcsec and a Strehl ratio of 0.26. Single 5.4 ms\nexposures from 20 widely separated time periods were se-\nlected for Fig. 2c. Each of the constituent exposures had a\nStrehl ratio greater than 0.27, resulting in an image core\nwith 80\u000293 milliarcsec FWHM and a Strehl of 0.30 af-\nter shifting and adding. For Fig. 2d the exposures with\nthe highest 1% of Strehl ratios are selected, giving a \fnal\nimage with FWHM of 79\u000294 milliarcsec and Strehl ra-\ntio of 0.30. All of these procedures give images with high\nStrehl ratios. There is, however, a trade-o\u000b between the\nhigher sensitivity for faint reference stars achieved by the\nlong sequence in Fig. 2a and the smoothness of the halo\nFig. 2. a-d) Image quality of \u000f Aquilae using di\u000bering criteria\nfor exposure selection from a 32 s run.

For the remainder of this letter we have used\nthe best 1% of exposures in any observation to produce\nthe \fnal image.\nFigure 3 shows an example image of \u0010 Boo\u00a8tis gen-\nerated by selecting exposures from a dataset of 23 200\nframes. The image shows a di\u000braction-limited central peak\n(Strehl = 0.26, FWHM = 83\u000294 milliarcsec) and \frst Airy\nring superposed on a faint halo for each star. 300 milliarc-\nseconds from the component stars the surface brightness\nof the halo reaches only 2% of that in the stellar disks.\nThe 232 frames selected came from a range of di\u000berent\nepochs, helping to reduce the level of fluctuation around\nthe stars. The high dynamic range of the technique is ev-\nident from the contour plot of the same image (Fig. 4).\nThe fluctuations in the halo reach only 0.1% of the peak\nbrightness 700 milliarcsec from the stars. The magnitude\ndi\u000berence between the two components in this image is\n0.048 \u0006 0.005, in good agreement with ESA (1997).\nFigure 5 shows the result of a similar selection of\nthe 1% of images with the best Strehl ratios from a\ndataset of 7000 short-exposure CCD images of \f Delphini.\nIn this case the zenith angle of the observation was\nL4 J.

(2000) of 1:071 \u0006 0:004 at\n798 nm and 1:052\u0006 0:010 at 884 nm made using a 1.5 m\ntelescope. The images shown of \u000f Aquilae, \u0010 Boo\u00a8tis and \f\nDelphini are representative of those for all the stars listed\nin Table 1 with regards to Strehl ratio and core FWHM.\n4. Conclusions and future prospects\nThe observations described here show that selection of\nshort exposure images can reliably provide di\u000braction-\nlimited images with Strehl ratios of 0.25{0.30 at wave-\nlengths as short as 0.8 microns with 2.5 m telescopes.\nThe images are similar in core angular resolution and\nFig. 5. The best 1% of exposures of \f Delphini, shifted and\nadded\nStrehl ratio to the highest resolution images from adaptive\noptics at wavelengths shorter than 1 \u0016m (Graves et al.\n1998). The faintest stars used in these trial observations\nwere of magnitude +6. The readout noise of the present\ncamera (\u0018100 e\u2212) would have set a limiting magnitude of\n+11.5 if 30 ms exposures had been used. Current develop-\nment of CCD detectors with e\u000bectively zero readout noise\nand higher quantum e\u000eciency (Mackay et al. 2001) will\nprovide important advantages in the use of the exposure\nselection method in the near future. The limiting mag-\nnitude for reference stars is expected to be fainter than\n+15.5, and fainter than +23 for unresolved objects in the\nsame isoplanatic patch. In cases where the seeing is dom-\ninated primarily by one turbulent atmospheric layer at\na height H, the diameter of the isoplanatic patch at the\ntimes of the good selected exposures will be 7r0=H or say\n2.5 m\/5 km = 1.7 arcmin. There would then be >80% sky\ncoverage by usable reference stars under 0.5 arcsec seeing\nconditions for 2.5 m telescopes.\nAcknowledgements.
