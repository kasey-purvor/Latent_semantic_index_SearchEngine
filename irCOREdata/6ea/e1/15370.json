The study of megalithic monuments \nhas benefited from these developments but remains hampered by the indirect \nrelationship between the materials that are dated and the structures themselves. \nDrawing on evidence from France, Scandinavia and Iberia, it is nonetheless arguable \nthat available patterns of dates suggest an event-like tempo to the construction of \nmegalithic monuments, with large numbers being built within relatively short periods \nof time. This has implications for typological models and for the social context in \nwhich such monuments were designed and built. \nKey words: AMS dating, chronology, megalithic monuments, Neolithic, passage \ngraves, typology \nPrehistoric chronology in archaeological texts has usually been discussed on scales far \nremoved from that of ordinary human lifetimes. Explanations couched in the long-\nterm, or in temporal vagueness, may be appropriate for certain types of archaeological \nquestion, but they frustrate the understanding of key sequences and developments. \nOne response to this has been the concept of \u201etime perspectivism\u201f, which studies how \ndifferences in the temporal scale and resolution of archaeological datasets constrain or \nexpand the questions we can investigate (Bailey 2007). Even long-term phenomena \nsuch as climatic or environmental changes will have been perceived within the \nexperience of individual lifetimes, however, and it is only with the increasing \nprecision of archaeological dating techniques that we can begin to understand change \n 2 \nfrom the standpoint of prehistoric societies and their individual members. \nMany kinds of archaeological material remain difficult to date since they are \ninherently unsuitable for the direct application of radiometric methods. In these \ninstances, chronologies are forced to be reliant on typology, or on the dating of \nassociated material such as charcoal or bone. Such is the case with the Neolithic \nchambered tombs of Western Europe. The challenge in dating these monuments \nvaries from region to region depending upon the local geology. Where conditions of \npreservation allow, human skeletal remains generally provide the most satisfactory \napproach. That assumes, however, that there is a direct connection between a \nparticular episode of funerary activity and the construction of the monument, an \nassumption that may not always be secure. The danger of residual material can be \nillustrated by examples where the radiocarbon chronology does not match well-\nfounded expectations of age based on monument typology. Such may be the \nexplanation at Bougon in western France, for example, where the earliest dates from \nthe basal layer within the chamber appear to be half a millennium older than is \nconsistent with the dating of other burial monuments of this type (Scarre et al. 2003; \nMohen and Scarre 2002). The stratigraphic context is secure, and the samples were \ndated by two separate laboratories, so that it is difficult to account for the discrepancy \nin any other way. In other cases, there is evidence to suggest that a tomb was entirely \ncleared of its contents at some stage during its use, with the consequence that the \nmajority of the associated human remains belong to an episode of reuse that occurred \nat an uncertain interval of time after the initial construction of the tomb. A good \nexample is provided by the all\u00e9e couverte (gallery grave) of La Chauss\u00e9e-Tirancourt \nin northern France, where a whole layer of burials appears to have been removed, \nleaving only a handful of inconspicuous bones trodden into the chalk floor of the \n 3 \ntomb that the cleaners overlooked (Masset 1997, 104).  \nThe multiplication of AMS radiocarbon dates for human skeletal material from \nNeolithic chambered tombs has nonetheless revolutionised our grasp of their \nchronology. More importantly, in favourable circumstances it allows us to generate \nprecise chronologies that reduce the broad spans of vaguely defined prehistoric time \nto the historical specificity of individual life spans and generations. This has had a \nmajor impact on our understanding of Neolithic burial monuments. In the first place, \nprecision-dating of monuments and the deposits and activities associated with them \nallows them to enter more fully into the discussion of memory in the societies in \nquestion. That is borne out by recent AMS dating (backed by Bayesian statistics) of a \nseries of Early Neolithic long mounds in southern Britain, which found that the \nmonuments most similar in form were not necessarily the closest in time.  \nSuch a conclusion challenges the assumptions of standard typological approaches and \nenables new questions to be considered. Did these monuments of the dead \nconsciously evoke a timelessness of tradition, or deliberately copy older monument \nstyles \u201cto align themselves with earlier generations and their renown?\" (Whittle and \nBayliss 2007, 25). The newly precise dating also enables us to contemplate the \nimplications of a tight and rapid sequence of events assignable to periods of a few \ngenerations. We can now ask, for example, whether the building of the Ascott-under-\nWychwood chambered cairn was witnessed by a child or juvenile who then in old age \nwas able to direct the construction of Hazleton North (Whittle et al. 2007:132) \nSetting the question: typology and chronology \nArmed with these new perspectives I wish to return to a question that I raised some \nyears ago, in respect of the typology and chronology of the Neolithic chambered \n 4 \ntombs of the Armorican massif of northwest France, and their relationship to issues of \ntiming, tempo and change (Scarre 2001). This is a region of acidic soils where the \nabsolute dating of monuments has been hampered by the scarcity of associated human \nremains available for radiocarbon dating. AMS dating (in particular the use of smaller \nsample sizes) has to some degree ameliorated the problem but reliable radiometric \ndates are still much less numerous than would be required to construct a detailed and \nsecure chronology.  \nThe generally accepted sequence of monument forms and their chronology (Boujot \nand Cassen 1993) relies heavily on the model of typological succession and on the \ndating of associated artefactual material. This is the latest in a long series of \narchitectural models to be proposed for the Breton monuments. The Reverend \nWilliam Lukis in 1868 noted the wide variety of megalithic chambers encountered in \nBrittany, and concluded that \u201cthese forms indicate not merely a long residence of their \nbuilders in this country, but, as I believe, a progress in constructive science\u201d (Lukis \n1869, 219). Some decades later, Zacharie Le Rouzic argued that the Morbihan \nsequence began with the low earthen mounds, which were followed by passage graves \nwith corbelled vaults, and those in turn by passage graves roofed by capstones and \nall\u00e9es couvertes (Le Rouzic 1933). Such schemes may be compared with those for \nother regions of Europe such as Ireland or Galicia that propose cycles of development \nfrom small and simple to large and complex and then back to simple again (Sheridan \n1986; Criado Boado and Fabregas Valcarce 1989). \nThese models advocate general principles of development, for instance that long \nmounds preceded circular mounds, or that passage graves morphed gradually into \n\u201egallery graves\u201f in which the distinction between passage and chamber was eventually \nerased. In so doing they make a number of key assumptions. In first place, they \n 5 \nenvisage a process of progressive replacement, where one monument form is \nsucceeded across an entire region by another. Thus long mounds are replaced and \nsucceeded by passage graves, and they in turn undergo a process of \u201eevolution\u201f \nextending over a period of perhaps several centuries. In second place, these models \nmay all too easily give the impression that the succession of monument forms was \ngradual and spread out evenly through time.  \nThat is not an inevitable reading of a typological scheme of this kind. The prominence \nand durability of Neolithic monuments would have left them as models to be copied \nby subsequent generations even had there been breaks in the sequence of several \ncenturies or more. Without the benefit of reliable and detailed absolute dating, \nhowever, it is impossible to determine whether monument-building was a continuous \nprocess, or whether it should be envisaged more as a horizon-type event, where large \nnumbers of tombs were constructed in relatively short bursts. The implications of \nsuch an alternative model for the social and ceremonial context of tomb building and \nthe transmission of knowledge across the generations are clearly profound. \nThe potential pitfalls may be illustrated by considering one particular monument \nsituated to the south of the Armorican massif in the sedimentary basin of west-central \nFrance. The site is the long cairn of Priss\u00e9-la-Charri\u00e8re, built in limestone terrain \nwhere human bone is well preserved (Laporte et al. 2002; Scarre, Laporte and \nJoussaume 2003; Soler et al. 2003). A ten-year campaign of excavations from 1995 \n(since continued by Luc Laporte) revealed a complex structural sequence, beginning \nat the western end with a small, probably closed megalithic chamber within a circular \ndry-stone surround. This was subsequently enclosed within a rectangular cairn \nencircled by a substantial rock-cut ditch, which was then extended massively to the \neast to create a 100m long cairn. The new enlarged monument contained two passage \n 6 \ngraves, one of them integral to the extension, the second a pre-existing monument that \nhad stood as a separate structure within its own circular cairn. This brief outline \nillustrates the complexity of the structural sequence, which involved funerary spaces \nof different kinds, and the deliberate infilling of the earlier rock cut ditch. In \ntraditional typological terms, the closed chamber within its dry-stone surround would \nbe considered an earlier form than the passage graves. Analogues can indeed be found \nalong the Atlantic fa\u00e7ade of France, from Brittany to the Pyrenees (Scarre, Laporte \nand Joussaume 2003). What is remarkable, however, is that the sequence of AMS \nradiocarbon dates on human skeletal material (mostly disarticulated) relating to the \nsuccessive structural phases cannot statistically be distinguished at the 2  level. The \norder of events is clear; but their pace and timing are much more rapid than might \nhave been anticipated. Furthermore, there is the suggestion within this series of dates \nthat the closed chamber and the two passage graves were contemporary, or at the very \nleast followed each other very closely in time.  \nIt is issues of timing and pace, and the fruitful combination of chronology and \ntypology, that I wish to address in the remainder of this paper. To anticipate, there is \nsuggestive evidence from a number of regions that particular monument forms were \nbuilt in the course of brief intervals of time that have some of the character of \nhistorical events. This suggests that megalithic and other Neolithic monuments may \nonly have been typical or characteristic of certain regions in the sense that they \nsurvived as visible monuments from earlier times, not as a continuous practice of \nconstruction. More provocatively, it obliges us to consider what were the specific \nsocial and cultural circumstances in which \u201ebursts\u201f of monument building could have \nbeen generated. And furthermore, it injects a crucial historical perspective of short-\nterm and sometimes sudden change into the long-term perspectives of prehistory. \n 7 \nDating evidence from two regions has been chosen through which to explore these \nissues more fully: northern Europe, and western Iberia. In both cases, the radiocarbon \ndates used are those available in existing publications, and the reader is referred to \nthose publications for fuller details of the samples, materials and contexts. To repeat \nan analysis of the kind undertaken for the southern British long mounds in these other \nregions would be an enormous task requiring a sifting of all previous radiocarbon \ndates and the commissioning of many new ones. That is not my aim in the present \ncontext. What I wish to show is that the published data, critically considered in the \nlight of the recent British study, suggests that the same pattern may be repeated in \nnumerous regions and that there is therefore scope for repeating that kind of exercise \nin all those areas of northern and western Europe where megalithic monuments occur. \nTowards precision \nThe megalithic graves of Northern Europe have a prominent place in this discussion \non three specific grounds: striking regularity of form; precision radiocarbon dating; \nand abundance. \nThe megalithic tombs of this region are divided conventionally into two groups, \ndolmens and passage graves. The former are typically modest-sized rectangular or \npolygonal chambers constructed of four to six uprights covered by a capstone \n(Midgley 2008:56). In northern Germany, dolmens have been further subdivided into \nUrdolmen, erweiterten Dolmen, and Grossdolmen: the Urdolmen usually consisting \nof a small closed chamber, or one where the entrance is merely a gap in the chamber \nwall; the erweiterte Dolmen with additional pairs of stones lengthening the chamber, \none pair frequently framing the entrance or forming a short passage; and the \nGrossdolmen distinguished by its size and by the number of orthostats, but having the \n 8 \nsame variety of entrance arrangements as the erweiterte Dolmen (Sprockhoff 1938:3-\n29; Schuldt 1972:22-24). Some of the \u201egreat dolmens\u201f have long passages: 4.4m long \nat Brejningg\u00e5rd, or 3m at Vedsted (Midgley 2008:63). In any other region of Europe \nthese would be described as passage graves, but in northern Europe that term is \nreserved for a different category of tomb. The passages of erweiterte Dolmen or \nGrossdolmen are set on the long axis of the chamber; the \u201etrue\u201f northern passage \ngrave (Ganggrab) by contrast has a passage leading from the middle of one side of an \nelongated chamber, with passage and chamber together creating a T-shaped plan (Fig. \n1). \nThe striking feature of these T-shaped passage graves is the regularity of design that \nso many of them display. Chambers are generally rectangular in form, though \nsometimes with bowed side walls that can result in an oval ground plan. Most are 8 to \n10m long and 2 to 2.5m wide, with 8 or 10 pairs of orthostats supporting 6 or 7 \ncapstones (Hansen 1993:21; Midgley 2008:74). Passages may be 8m or in exceptional \ncases as much as 16m long. These monuments express a powerful sense of identity \nand design, with carefully laid dry-stonework closing the gaps between the irregular \noutlines of the split erratic boulders that supply the orthostats. The careful conception \nand execution of the building project has been demonstrated by recent excavation and \nconsolidation at a number of Danish passage graves, including Kong Svends H\u00f8j, \nJordeh\u00f8j and Birkeh\u00f8j (Dehn et al. 1995, 2000, 2004). Crushed flint was packed \nagainst the outside of the chamber and overlaid by clay or loam to provide an \nimpervious layer. Overlapping flat slabs were sometimes laid over the capstones to \nfurther ensure that the chamber interior remained dry (Dehn and Hansen 2007). While \nthe notion of specialist builders or architects may be anachronistic, it is clear that \nthese passage graves were built to a very tightly defined and closely observed format. \n 9 \nIt is striking to note that while some tombs show evidence of contemporary repairs, \ncarefully undertaken to maintain the structural integrity of the tomb, such concern was \nentirely absent only a few centuries later at sites such as Magleh\u00f8j where the chamber \nwas broken into during the Late Neolithic for the insertion of new burials (Dehn \n2009). \nThe T-shaped passage graves are remarkable not only for their regularity of design \nand sophisticated construction but also for their abundance. Systematic surveys \nconducted by the Danish National Museum since the 19th century have recorded the \nlocations of 7287 megalithic tombs, 2,364 of which are represented by surviving \nremains (Ebbesen 1985, Table 3). The majority of these will have been dolmens of \nvarious kinds, with passage graves making up only some 20 per cent of the total. The \nfigures, however, constitute only a fraction of the original number of tombs. Klaus \nEbbesen, from a variety of sources, estimates that they represent only 10 per cent of \nthe original total, and that the original number of Danish megalithic tombs may have \nbeen around 25,000 (Ebbesen 1985:39-40, 54). Were we to add those of northern \nGermany and Sweden, the overall figure may have been in excess of 40,000 (Midgley \n2008:31). These are remarkable densities of megalithic tombs, higher than in any \nother area of Europe. \nIf we accept the figure of 40,000 tombs and the proposal that around 20 per cent of \nthese were passage graves, a total of some 8000 passage graves must once have \nexisted in northern Europe. Dolmens and passage graves together date to the middle \nor later part of the 4th millennium BC, and the numbers indicate that (even if each \ntomb required only a few weeks or months to build), in any one year 100 or more may \nhave been under construction. The chronology can indeed be refined even more \nclosely. Radiocarbon dates suggest that the construction of passage graves began \n 10 \nrelatively abruptly around 3400\/3300 BC (Persson and Sj\u00f6gren 1995; Fig. 2). \nDolmens may have preceded passage graves by a century or so, although the evidence \nfor this is not entirely conclusive (Persson and Sj\u00f6gren 1995:74).  \nThe duration of the period during which these tombs were constructed is difficult to \nestablish from the radiocarbon evidence alone, since passage graves by their very \nnature remained open for deposition and reuse. The pattern of radiocarbon dates for \nhuman remains in the Swedish passage grave of R\u00f6ssberga illustrates this well, with \nan initial concentration of dates around 3300 BC followed by a long tail suggesting \ncontinued deposition down to the middle of the 3rd millennium BC, and discrete \nepisodes of reuse around 2000 BC, 1200 BC, and in the middle centuries of the 1st \nmillennium BC (Persson and Sj\u00f6gren 1995, 67). Conversely, the dates for what is \nstratigraphically the earliest burial at the G\u00f6khem 17 passage grave (average of two \ndates 4750\u00b1100 BP; 2  range 3763-3140 cal BC; 98 per cent of variance 3716-3337 \nBC) may suggest a slightly earlier origin for passage graves (Persson and Sj\u00f6gren \n1995), although it might be explicable in other ways.  \nThe uncertainty introduced by the G\u00f6khem date, and by the long tail of dates from \nR\u00f6ssberga and other sites, is to some extent counterbalanced by a series of recent \ndates for Danish passage graves. The majority of radiocarbon dates for megalithic \ntombs are for material beneath or within them, and direct dating of the structure itself \nis rarely possible. A rare exception is provided by Danish passage graves in which \nfolded layers of birch bark were laid between the courses of dry stonework. Owing to \nfavourable preservation conditions, such birch bark has occasionally survived, and is \nknown from ten passage graves in northern Jutland and across the island of Zealand \n(Dehn and Hansen 2006). With one exception, the 2  age ranges fall consistently in \n 11 \nthe period 3500-2900 cal BC, five of the eight sites clustering more specifically \nbetween 3300 and 2900 BC (Dehn and Hansen 2006; Fig. 3). There is indeed no \nsignificant difference between the dates from these five sites, and they in turn overlap \nstatistically with the dates from the other three. If they are representative of the \nchronology of passage grave construction as a whole, they suggest that most of the \nestimated 8000 passage graves were built as a horizon event spanning only a few \ngenerations beginning around 3300 BC. Such a conclusion would of course be \nentirely consistent with the regularity in plan and construction that these monuments \ndisplay. They suggest the development of a set of techniques and practices that were \npassed down from person to person over a century or so, which involved specialist \nknowledge, and which may be visualised as a veritable frenzy of megalithic-building, \nespecially since many of the 30,000+ dolmens were probably constructed during the \nsame period. \nThe north European evidence provides a model of megalithic tomb construction that \nexplains typological and constructional similarity in terms of proximity in date. The \ntombs are similar in design because they were built at around the same time. To that \nextent, it may be considered to support the traditional typological approach that \nequates morphology with chronology. Before considering the broader implications of \nsuch a model, however, we must explore whether it might apply to other regions.  \nDating, decoration and design \nThe second case-study is taken from Iberia, the southern province of the Atlantic \nmegalith distribution. Throughout much of the peninsula, tomb chronologies remain \nill-defined, but two adjacent areas of northern Iberia, Cantabria and Galicia, have \nprovided evidence that is consistent with event-type sequences.  \n 12 \nIn Cantabrian Spain some 1250 megalithic monuments have been recorded, the \nmajority of them tombs. They can be divided into a number of types: small closed \nchambers, chambers opening to the east (without passage), and chambers with an \nentrance portal or vestibule (Arias et al. 2006). This typological variability, coupled \nwith the wide chronological attribution of the grave goods, made it reasonable to \nsuppose that these megalithic tombs had been constructed over a lengthy period of \ntime from the Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age. The 40 available radiocarbon dates, \nhowever, form a tightly clustered pattern with a major concentration in the century \n4000-3900 cal BC. Statistically, 50 per cent of the probability of the median for these \ndates falls in the period 4082-3827 cal BC (Arias et al. 2006:19). Hence the variability \nin typology does not correspond to a sequence of chronological change. On the \ncontrary, it is possible that most of the megalithic monuments of this region, whatever \ntheir morphology, were built within a very short period. The associated artefactual \nmaterial provides a poor indication of construction date and includes Beaker pottery, \nbattle axes and metal objects of the 3rd or early 2nd millennium BC; a small tail of \ncalibrated C14 ages (at 2 ) probably corresponds likewise to the later reuse of these \nburial chambers. \nIt should be remarked that the Cantabrian dates are not without their problems, and \nmost of them would not individually sustain critical scrutiny. In the absence of \npreserved human remains in this region of acidic soils, many of them are on charcoal, \nand some relate to buried soil horizons (Arias et al. 2006:21). As a pattern, however, \nthey are suggestive. \nThe Galician and north Portuguese monuments present a still wider range of \nmorphologies, and in this case there is indeed evidence for a chronological succession \n 13 \nof monument forms. The two types that concern us here are closed megalithic \nchambers or pit graves covered by a mound; and passage graves. The former \ncorrespond approximately to those of neighbouring Cantabria, and fall within a \nsimilar (albeit less tightly constrained) chronological bracket, concentrated within the \ntwo centuries 4000-3700 BC (4000-3800 BC for northern Portugal, 3900-3700 BC for \nGalicia) (Alonso and Bello 1997:511). The dates for passage graves overlap with \nthose for closed chambers, with an initial concentration in the period 3800-3700 BC \n(Fig. 4). There is then a spread or tail of passage grave dates extending into the late \n3rd millennium, but given the open and reusable character of these monuments, the \nlater dates correspond most likely to later interments rather than to initial \nconstruction.  \nThis interpretation can be supported on two grounds. First, there is the detailed \nsequence from the Dombate passage grave, for which a series of 13 radiocarbon dates \nwas obtained (Alonso and Bello 1997). The moment of construction itself is indicated \nby two dates: 3789-3637 cal BC from the surface of the palaeosoil and 3940-3630 cal \nBC for a layer of charcoal on the chamber floor. Later dates in the sequence relate to \nthe laying out of the forecourt (c.3100-3030 cal BC), the blocking of the passage \n(2817-2691 cal BC), and a later intrusion probably associated with the deposition of \nBeaker pottery (Alonso and Bello 1997:512-513). \nSecondly, these patterns may be compared with the results of direct C14 dating of \npainted decoration in megalithic tombs from Galicia and northern Portugal. Of the ten \navailable dates, two have large standard deviations (> \u00b1100) and another two, from \nthe monument of Coto dos Mouros, gave contradictory results. The remaining six \ndates fall within the range 4340-3980 cal BC to 3650-3300 cal BC, the four central \ndates clustering tightly around 3900-3700 cal BC (Steelman et al. 2005: table 1; \n 14 \nCarrera and Fabregas 2006:53; Fig. 5). Two of the sites are classic passage graves \n(Pedra da Moura 3960-3640 cal BC; Forno dos Mouros 3800-3620 cal BC), and \nfurthermore are only 1km distant from each other. It is of course possible that the \npainted decoration was added after the construction of the tombs. At Monte dos \nMarxos, indeed, two successive layers of painted motifs were dated to 4340-3980 cal \nBC and 3810-3630 cal BC, implying a gap of perhaps two centuries or more between \nthe two episodes. At Antelas, the date for the painted decoration (4655\u00b165 BP) has \nbeen said to indicate a \u201ctemporal lag\u201d after the construction of the chamber (5070\u00b165 \nBP) (Steelman et al. 2005:387), though the latter is in fact one of a series of five dates \non charcoal from the buried soil that are stated elsewhere to be \u201cstratigraphically \nearlier than the construction of the monument\u201d (Hedges et al. 1998:447).  \nMore significantly it should be noted that the dates for the painted decoration of these \ntombs agree closely with the dates cited above that bracket the construction of the \nDombate passage grave. Hence the overall pattern is consistent with the view that in \nmost cases decoration occurred at approximately the same time as primary \nconstruction (Steelman et al. 2005:386). The evidence once again supports the \nconclusion that many, if not all, of the passage graves of Galicia and northern \nPortugal were built within a relatively short period of no more than two or three \ncenturies around 3800-3500 BC (Fig. 5). Even this chronology is relatively imprecise, \nhowever, and the reality may be that these passage graves were built and decorated \nwithin the space of only a few generations. \nIn other regions of Iberia, the available radiocarbon dates do not yet allow a similar \nlevel of chronological precision. It might be suggested on morphological grounds, \nhowever, that certain groups of tombs are so internally consistent in construction and \ndesign that, by analogy with the Scandinavian T-shaped passage graves, we might \n 15 \nexpect them to have been the work of a small number of successive generations. Two \nsets of tombs in particular might be considered.  \nFirst are the passage graves of southern and central Portugal and adjacent regions of \nSpain, which typically have seven or eight orthostats forming a polygonal chamber. \nThe tombs are distinctive in plan, technique and appearance, the orthostats positioned \nso as lean inwards, their edges overlapping and resting against each other in a \u201ehouse \nof cards\u201f manner to provide structural integrity. There is a cluster of around 500 such \n\u201eantas\u201f in the central Alentejo (concelhos of Evora (139), Reguengos (134) and Pavia \n(136): Rocha 2003).  \nThese monuments have proved difficult to date, although there is evidence to suggest \nthat the large passage graves were built during the middle centuries of the 4th \nmillennium BC (Calado 2006:82). Victor Gon\u00e7alves associates these megalithic \ntombs of orthostatic construction with small 4th millennium settlements, although the \navailable C14 dates for burials (human skeletal material) at Cebolinhos 2 and Santa \nMargarida 3 fall within the later 3rd millennium and have been attributed to reuse \n(Gon\u00e7alves 2006:490). What is most striking about the Alentejan antas in the present \ncontext is their regularity and consistency of design. That becomes particularly \npronounced in the Evora region of Alentejo (Portugal), where many of the tombs have \nprecisely seven orthostats forming their polygonal chambers (Fig. 6). Such regularity \nof plan might indicate a tightly prescribed tradition of construction persisting over \nseveral centuries. Alternatively, however, they may correspond to a single short-lived \nhorizon of construction lasting only a century or two. \nSimilar observations could be applied to the so-called \u201etholos\u201f tombs of southern \nIberia. These extend geographically from Los Millares in Alm\u00e9ria in the southeast to \n 16 \nAlcalar in the Portuguese Algarve. The tholos tombs differ from earlier Iberian \nchambered tombs in a number of respects, but above all in the method of their \nconstruction that employs predominantly dry-stonework instead of megalithic blocks. \nThey consist typically of a long passage leading to a tall corbel-vaulted chamber. The \nchambers contain collective inhumations that can comprise from small numbers to \nover 100 individuals (Garc\u00eda Sanju\u00e1n 2006). \nThe presence of copper artefacts in tholos tombs has been recognised since the \nexcavations conducted by the Siret brothers in the late 19th century and supports a \nrelatively late position within the Iberian chambered tomb sequence as a whole. This \nis confirmed by the radiocarbon dates that are available. The earliest dates are from \ntholos tombs in southeast Spain, notably at Los Millares (tomb 19), and El \nBarranquete (tomb 7), consistent with construction in the last century of the 4th or the \nfirst two centuries of the 3rd millennium BC. Later dates from tholos tombs span a \nwide time-range including three dates in the mid-3rd millennium BC (La Pijotilla \ntombs 1 and 3, Huerta Montero), and a series of much later dates from the late 2nd \nand early 1st millennium BC (La Encantada 1, Palacio III, El Barranquete tomb 11) \n(Garc\u00eda Sanju\u00e1n 2006: table 11.4). The latest dates are clearly attributable to episodes \nof reuse; the date from Palacio III indeed relates not to the tholos tomb chamber but to \na cremation deposit in a pit covered by a separate small cairn to the northwest of the \ntholos tomb (Garc\u00eda Sanju\u00e1n and Wheatley 2006).  \nGiven the accessibility of the tomb chambers and the practice of multiple inhumation, \nthe best guide to the date of construction is provided by the early dates of 3100-2900 \nBC. Garc\u00eda Sanju\u00e1n suggests that the earliest tholoi are to be dated to this period \n(Garc\u00eda Sanju\u00e1n 2006: table 11.4). The strong similarities in design and construction \nmight however be taken to suggest that the whole category to tholos tombs was built \n 17 \nwithin the space of only a few generations, with the \u201etail\u201f of radiocarbon dates \ncorresponding to continued use (mid-3rd millennium dates) followed by occasional \nreuse in the late 2nd or early 1st millennium BC. Hence here again the overall spread \nof dates obscures what on grounds of close structural similarity might better be \ninterpreted as a brief horizon of tholos tomb construction around the turn of the \n4th\/3rd millennium BC. \nConclusion \nChronology remains a problematic issue where megalithic monuments are concerned. \nDirect dating of the structures themselves is rarely possible. Few sites offer any \nopportunity for direct AMS dating in the manner afforded by the folded layers of \nbirch bark in Danish passage graves. The painted motifs in Iberian tombs provide only \na terminus ante quem for the surfaces on which they were applied. Future advances in \nluminescence dating may ultimately present an alternative approach. Direct \nluminescence dating of granite surfaces has been applied with some measure of \nsuccess to at least one Swedish megalithic tomb (Vafiadou et al. 2007), but the \nprecision of luminescence determinations remains poor by comparison with AMS \nradiocarbon dates. \nIf we are unable accurately and precisely to date many megalithic tombs, recent \napplications of precision AMS dating to closely contextualised samples nonetheless \nbegin to suggest new patterns in the chronology of their construction. Some 40 years \nago, Richard Atkinson calculated (from the data then available) the probable number \nof burials in the Neolithic burial chambers of southern Britain and their relationship to \npopulation size. He concluded that those buried individuals must represent only a \nfraction of the total population (Atkinson 1968). That conclusion is emphatically \n 18 \nreinforced by dating evidence which now places the construction and principal use of \nthose tombs within a period of two or three centuries in the mid 4th millennium BC \nrather than spread out across the whole of the 1000-year period that Atkinson \nenvisaged. Most Neolithic inhabitants of southern Britain could clearly never have \nbeen buried in such monuments, since the limited period during which they were built \nand used represents only a fraction of the Neolithic period. \nCan we extend that conclusion more generally, and propose that the Neolithic \nchambered tombs of Western Europe were generally built within short bursts of \nactivity, followed by periods during which no new tombs were built (although \nexisting tombs might continue to be used or be reused)? The evidence I have \npresented above is suggestive, although it does not conclusively demonstrate that such \nwas everywhere the case. To establish that, a systematic sifting of all the radiocarbon \ndates in each region would be required, along with the commissioning of many new \ndates. That is a substantial undertaking far beyond the scope of the present paper, \nwhich simply seeks to highlight potential patterns among the existing published data. \nIf correct, however, it suggests that when better evidence becomes available the \nvagueness of current megalithic chronologies might in many regions be reduced to a \nseries of short horizons or events, each of which could be explored in terms of social \npractice, mortuary beliefs and interregional connections. \nIt also obliges us to reconsider the centrality sometimes accorded to chambered tombs \nand other monument types in traditional accounts of some regional Neolithic \nsequences. The construction of these monuments left an enduring mark upon the \nlandscape and it is likely that earlier monuments framed the activities and beliefs of \nlater generations (Barrett 1999). The active construction of monuments may not \nalways have been the gradual process that is assumed, however, and a more detailed \n 19 \nand secure chronology might show for a region such as Brittany, for example, that the \nbuilding of monuments fell within a limited number of tightly defined phases. The \ndecorated menhirs, the passage graves, and the all\u00e9es couvertes may each have been \nthe work of a few generations of builders. The event-like character of these building \nprocesses may become clearer still if we are able more confidently to separate \nprimary interments from continuing deposition in cases where human remains are \npresent. The currently proposed time-bracket of 4200-3900 BC for passage graves in \nnorthern and western France is based largely on C14 dates for human remains which \nare essentially termini ante quos (see e.g. Dron et al. 2003) \nOne attraction of this proposal (speculative though it is) is the constructive \ncombination of typology and absolute dating, and the potential it may offer of \nextracting \u201eevents\u201f from the palimpsest of often poorly dated archaeological evidence. \nSuch \u201eevents\u201f themselves must be problematic in certain regards (Lucas 2008). \nEnvisaging prehistoric sequences within the time frame of human life spans or short \nsequences of successive generations does, however, enable us to consider processes of \nconstruction and innovation at a human scale (Whittle et al. 2008, 68). It also enables \nus to replace the image of a venerable and enduring Atlantic monument tradition with \na more dynamic vision of real events and punctuated change. \n \nAcknowledgements \nI am grateful to the two anonymous referees and to Alan Saville for their comments \non an earlier version of this paper.

From \n1995-2004 he co-directed excavations (with Luc Laporte and Roger Joussaume) at the \nMiddle Neolithic long mound of Priss\u00e9-la-Charri\u00e8re in western France. His most \nrecent field project is a study of megalithic monuments and landscape on the island of \nHerm in the Guernsey archipelago. He was founder-editor of the Cambridge \nArchaeological Journal from 1991 to 2005, and in 2006 was appointed Professor of \nArchaeology at Durham. He is the editor of the leading textbook of world prehistory, \nThe Human Past (2nd ed. 2009), and has recently completed a book on the Neolithic \nof Brittany shortly to be published by Oxford University Press. \n 26 \nAuthor address \nChris Scarre \nDepartment of Archaeology \nDurham University \nSouth Road \nDurham \nDH1 3LE \nchris.scarre@durham.ac.uk \n \nCaptions to Figures \nFigure 1.

L\u201f\u00e9tude des monuments \nm\u00e9galithiques a beaucoup profit\u00e9 de ce progr\u00e8s scientifique mais elle se trouve \ntoujours frein\u00e9e par le caract\u00e8re indirect du rapport entre les mat\u00e9riaux qui sont dat\u00e9s \net les structures m\u00e9galithiques elles-m\u00eames. La consid\u00e9ration de quelques s\u00e9quences \nde la France, des pays scandinaves, et de la p\u00e9ninsule ib\u00e9rique nous am\u00e8nent \u00e0 \nproposer que les datations maintenant disponibles laissent appara\u00eetre l\u201fhypoth\u00e8se \nselon laquelle la construction de monuments m\u00e9galithiques suivait un rythme non \nr\u00e9gulier, avec beaucoup de monuments construits pendant des p\u00e9riodes \nchronologiques assez reduites. Cette constatation apportera des implications \n 28 \nsignificatives pour les s\u00e9quences typologiques ainsi que pour le contexte social dans \nlequel des monuments ont \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7us et materialis\u00e9s. \nMots-cl\u00e9s: datations AMS, chronologie, monuments m\u00e9galithiques, N\u00e9olithique, \ntombes \u00e0 couloir, typologie \n"}
