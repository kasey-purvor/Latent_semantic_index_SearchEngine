Introduction \nThe problem of the energy cascade from meteorological or tidal forcing to small scale \ninternal waves and eventually mixing in the ocean has received significant attention in recent \nyears. This is because just how and where this mixing takes place has important implications for \nthe meridional circulation of the ocean. In terms of meteorologically induced mixing, calculations \nhave shown that wind forcing in regions of horizontally varying vorticity (e.g. Xing and Davies \n2005, Zhai et al., 2005) produces an enhancement in local mixing, and change in the internal wave \nspectrum. Consequently the determination of the internal wave spectral response of a model and \nassociated changes in Richardson number (Ri) is as important in modelling as in field \nmeasurements (e.g. Van Haren et al., 2002). \nIn the case of tidal forcing, when the topographic length scale is small compared to the \ntidal excursion, (e.g. sills at the entrance to fjords) the processes are highly non-linear (Vlasenko et \nal., 2005) and besides generating an internal tide at the same frequency as the barotropic tide, \nwaves such as lee waves, solitons and solibores are produced with much higher frequencies. As \nshown by Xing and Davies (2006) (hereafter XD06) small scale topographic features can produce \na cascade of energy to higher frequencies and mixing. \nAlthough recently there has been a major focus on modelling and measuring (New and Da \nSilva 2002) internal tides in oceanic regions and at sills the emphasis on understanding internal \ntide generation has focused on isolated topography e.g. a single seamount or a single sill (XD06). \nHowever recent measurements between two closely spaced sills in a fjord have shown that there is \nincreased mixing in such locations (Johnsson et al., 2007). \nHere a process study using an idealised cross sectional model of a fjord, initially with one \nsill and subsequently with two sills having an inter-sill distance comparable to that of the Ringdals \nfjord \u2013 Idefjord system (Johnsson et al., 2007) namely 1.5km, is used to examine to what extent \nthe internal tide in the inter-sill region between the two sills differs from that generated at a single \nsill. In particular changes in the internal wave spectrum due to internal wave reflection and \n 4\ngeneration of higher harmonics are examined. Changes in the Richardson number distribution are \nalso considered and implications for internal wave mixing between the sills are discussed. \nCalculations suggest that internal wave trapping between the sills is the reason for the enhanced \nmixing found in observations. This is discussed in a final section, as are the implications for \nmixing in oceanic situations with closely spaced topography. The importance of this oceanic \nmixing in these critical regions in terms of oceanic circulation and the need to make fine scale \nmeasurements (Van Haren et al., 2002) in such areas is also discussed.  \n \n2. Model and calculations. \n2.1 Model  \nFollowing on from the use of the MITgcm model to study mixing at a single sill (see \nXD06, and references therein for model details) the same model is used here. In the present study \ntwo identical sills are used. In order to determine how the internal tide generated at two sills \ndiffers from that produced at a single sill, initially calculations are performed with a single sill at x \n= 0 (Fig 1a). Subsequently calculations are performed with two sills, with one placed at x = 0, and \nthe other a distance D = 1.5km to its right. This separation is typical of sills in fjords and \ncorresponds to that observed by Johnsson et al. (2007). The channel representing the fjord is open \nat its ends. In order to avoid any false reflection from the open ends of the channel, where a \nsponge condition is applied, the channel extends to \u00b1 150 km. Single sill calculations with a range \nof grid sizes (Berntsen et al., 2008) showed that an accurate solution could be obtained with fine \nvertical (dz = 1m) and horizontal grid (dx of order 10m). These values were used here, although \noutside the sill region, dx increased gradually to 800m at the open boundary. Initial conditions \ncorresponded to a uniform vertical temperature gradient, giving a constant buoyancy frequency \nN=10-2 s-1 were applied. Motion was induced by the application of a sinusoidally varying body \nforce, at the M2 tidal period with Coriolis frequency f = 1.2 x 10 -4 s -1. \n 5\nSince calculations are performed on high resolution grids, minimum diffusivities (Kh, Kv) \nand viscosities (Ah, Av)(with subscripts h,v denoting horizontal and vertical values) were used \n(XD06, Berntsen et al., 2008) to maintain numerical stability. Values were set at Kh = Kv = 10-\n7m2s-1, and Ah = 10-1m2s-1, Av = 10-3m2s-1. However, unless molecular values and an infinitely fine \nhigh resolution grid are used then an accurate determination of the mixing is not possible. The aim \nhere is to examine the processes that lead to small Richardson numbers and how these change \nbetween the one and two sill calculations. In addition the change in the temperature field will be \nquantified in terms of changes in N. \n \n2.2 Single sill calculation. \nInitially a single sill calculation was performed with the sill at x = 0. The water depth in \nthe channel was set at h = 100m, with forcing amplitude U0 = 0.1ms-1 and sill height h0 = 70m, \ngiving a sill depth hs = 30m. To remove the effects of the initial conditions, the model was spun up \nfor seven tidal cycles, and \u201csnap shots\u201d of the solution in the sill region at intervals of 1\/8T (with \nT tidal period) were then examined. At t = 56\/8T (the end of the seventh tidal cycle when a \nperiodic solution was achieved) the barotropic flow to the right is a maximum and leads to an \nupward displacement of isotherms on the left side of the sill, and downward displacement on the \nright (Fig 1a). The large scale \u201cfar field\u201d response of the sill to this barotropic tidal forcing (not \npresented) is to generate an internal tide which propagates away from the sill. From a \u201csnap shot\u201d \nof the \u201cfar field\u201d distribution of currents (not shown), it is evident that away from the sill the \ninternal tide has a wavelength of order 20km, and a 180\u02da phase shift in the vertical which is typical \nof a first mode internal tide. In the present calculations this wavelength, \u03bb=20km is much larger \nthan the sill separation distance D = 1.5km. The implications of increasing D towards \u03bb are \ndiscussed later in the paper. \nIn the sill region (Fig 1a), unsteady lee waves are generated (XD06), and are responsible \nfor the small scale variability that is evident in Fig 1a. At t = 58\/8T, a jet separates from the top of \n 6\nthe sill (Fig 1b). At this time there is significant vertical shear in the region of the top of the sill \nassociated with the jet, that can lead to mixing (XD06). At t = 62\/8T when the flow is in the \nopposite direction an identical jet occurs on the opposite side of the sill.  \nAs discussed by XD06, associated with this jet and the short waves that are generated on \nthe lee side of sills there is a region of critical Richardson number (Ri < 0.25) (Fig 1c) where there \nis a potential for enhanced mid-water mixing to occur. It is evident from the tidally averaged (in \norder to remove advection, see below) distribution of Ri and temperature field, that the \ntemperature field at about mid-water has changed from its initial distribution. To quantify this and \nsee how it is different in the two sill calculation, the parameter 2o\n2\nN - N  DN =  was computed, \nwith No the initial buoyancy frequency and \n2\nN the tidally averaged buoyancy frequency value \ncentred at t = 6.5T. It is evident from DN contours (Fig 1d) that there has been appreciable mid-\nwater mixing at about z = -45m on either side of the sill. This mixing decreases from a maximum \nclose to the sill. As discussed previously the model does not have a sufficiently fine grid to \naccurately reproduce this mixing. However, as the main aim of the paper is to see to what extent \nthe one sill and two sill solutions differ then a comparison of the Ri and DN distribution from one \nand two sill calculations (see later) is useful.   \nA harmonic analysis of the u-component of the baroclinic velocity on the right hand side \nof the sill was performed (only the output at every fifth model grid was used) (Fig 2). The M2 tidal \ncurrent amplitude shows (Fig 2) a surface maximum, with amplitude decreasing away from the \nsill. A near-zero amplitude is evident at about mid-water, with an increase at depth. A 180\u02daphase \nchange occurs in the vertical (not presented) showing the presence of a first mode baroclinic tide. \nRegions of surface intensification are evident at the M4 frequency (Fig 2), with a local \nintensification at about mid-depth, suggesting that there are higher vertical modes in the near sill \nregion, as shown by the rapid change in phase through the vertical (not presented). In the case of \nhigher tidal harmonics their horizontal and vertical amplitude and phase change very rapidly, due \n 7\nto the presence of short waves. Some weak beam-like structures are present in these modes. From \ninternal tide theory, the slopes of the tidal beams are 0.8%, 2.6%, 4.2%, 5.5%, 7.0%, and 8.4% for \nthe M2 to M12 harmonics. Vertical velocity power spectra (depth integrated through the vertical) \nwere computed. These power spectra showed significant variability in the energy in the various \ntidal harmonics, which changed with location, reflecting the spatial variation in the u current \namplitude shown in Fig 2. For comparison with the two sill solution the power spectra at x = 750m \n(the location mid-way between the sills, in the two sill calculation) is given in Fig 3. \n \n2.3 Double sill calculation \nTo examine to what extent the presence of a second sill at x = 1500m modifies the \nsolution, the previous calculation was repeated with this additional sill. It is evident from Fig 1a \nthat at t = 56\/8T a region of intensified u tidal current in the upper 20m of the water column has \ndeveloped between the two sills. Although at t = 58\/8T there is still an intense jet that separates \nfrom the top of the right hand side of the second sill, such a jet does not occur on the right hand \nside of the sill at x = 0. Similarly half a tidal cycle later, namely t = 62\/8T (not presented) where a \njet occurs on the left hand side of the sill at x = 0, no such jet occurs on the left hand side of the \nsill at x = 1500m. This suggests that the second sill influences the nature of the internal waves and \njet in the region between x = 0 and 1500m. In addition the isotherm separation in the region has \nincreased. However, in terms of the large scale distribution of the internal tide, over the whole \nmodel region (not presented) this is not appreciably influenced by the presence of the second sill. \nIn essence the second sill only influences the internal tide distribution between the sills. This is \nbecause the sill separation D = 1.5km is much shorter than the horizontal wavelength of the M2 \ninternal tide, namely about 20km in the present case.  \nComparison of tidally averaged values of the Ri number and isotherm distributions \nbetween the one and two sill cases (Fig 1c) shows that the region of critical Ri number between the \nsills has significantly increased. In addition the mid-water separation of the isotherms is larger \n 8\nthan in the single sill calculation. Comparison of DN distributions (Fig 1d) shows that there has \nbeen substantially more mid-water mixing in the region between the two sills than found in the \nsingle sill case. This enhanced mixing has occurred despite the fact that the jet, that was present in \nthe single sill case and was thought to be a source of mixing (XD06), is no longer present in the \nregion between the sills. In addition this mixing is to first order horizontally uniform in the region, \nwhereas previously it was concentrated close to the sill (Fig 1d). Although as stated previously, \nthe model cannot accurately reproduce mixing, the presence of an enhanced region of critical Ri \nnumber in the two sill compared to the one sill calculation is indicative of a change in the \nmechanisms responsible for mixing. \nTo understand how the presence of the second sill has modified the tidal and Ri number \ndistribution between the sills, the u component of current was harmonically analysed. In the two \nsill case the u current M2 amplitude has a maximum midway between the sills, rather than close to \nthe sill, as in the single sill case (Fig 2). As previously the M2 current amplitude has a maximum in \nthe surface layer, reducing to near zero close to the bed. This suggests, together with the presence \nof an 180\u02da phase change in the vertical (not presented), that the first mode dominates.  \nThe spatial distribution of the M2, M6 and M10 harmonics, show (Fig 2) a u current \nmaximum amplitude, midway between the sills, although its vertical position changes from one \ntidal constituent to another due to different internal wave slopes, see earlier one sill discussion. In \nthe case of two sills, the propagating internal tides from each sill can be reflected from the \nopposite sill and combine to form a standing internal tide. In addition for the two sill case, higher \nharmonics exhibit rapid vertical phase changes (not presented) showing that higher vertical modes \nare present, and these also contribute to changes in the vertical position of the u current maxima.  \nAlthough the M2, M6 and M10 harmonics have a maximum u current amplitude midway \nbetween the sills, for M4 and M8 the u current amplitude is zero mid-way between the sills. This \nsuggests constructive and destructive interference of the internal tidal waves that propagate from \neach of the sills, to give standing waves between the sills. This is similar to the way in which \n 9\nseiche motion of a pycnocline is formed in a lake in response to wind forcing (Hall and Davies \n2005). As shown by Eriksen (1985) associated with internal wave reflection, as occurs here to \nform a standing wave, there is a significant increase in vertical shear and associated mixing. In the \npresent case short wave higher harmonics of the internal tide are generated and \u201ccaptured\u201d \nbetween the sills. Consequently internal wave energy cannot propagate out of the inter-sill region \nand contributes to enhanced shear and reduced Ri number in this area (Fig 1c). Associated with \nregions in which the Ri number falls below its critical value there is enhanced mixing as quantified \nin the DN distributions (Fig 1d). In essence the stratification in the region between the sills \nreduces below the corresponding level found in the single sill case. \nAssociated with the standing waves between the sills there are vertical modes of \nincreasing vertical structure (not shown). These give rise to a nodal point in the vertical velocity \n(w) at the centre of the region between the sills where u is a maximum at the frequency M2n, with n \nodd. This can be clearly seen in the w power spectra from the centre of the region, namely x = \n750m (Fig 3b) which shows no peak at the M2, M6, M10 etc frequency. As previously in the single \nsill case at x = 750m (Fig 3a) there is a drop off in energy at frequencies higher than those \nassociated with the internal tide. However for spectra close to the sill (not presented), in the two-\nsill case there is an increase in energy at the high frequency end of the spectrum. Also there is less \nenergy in the overall internal wave spectrum for the two-sill than the single sill problem. This \nsuggests that internal wave energy that is trapped between the sills cascades by non-linear \nprocesses into shorter internal waves and eventually mixing. It is this energy cascade that is \nresponsible for the enhanced mixing found in the two sill calculation and observed in \nmeasurements made between closely separated sills (Johnsson et al., 2007). Since the calculations \nare forced at only the M2 frequency, then the increase in energy at the high frequency end of the \nspectrum (Fig 3) results from an internal wave energy cascade to higher frequencies. \n \n3. Discussion and Summary \n 10\n A cross sectional non-hydrostatic model of an idealized fjord has been used to examine \nhow the internal wave field is changed by the presence of a second sill. Calculations showed that \nin the region between the sills, although not outside them, the second sill influenced the intensity \nof the jet that detached from the lee side of the sill. In addition the nature of the internal tidal wave \nwas changed from a progressive wave to a standing wave between the sills. Higher harmonics \nwere generated in the form of standing waves between the sills, and there was an increase in the \nenergy cascading to shorter wavelengths giving rise to an increase in the region of critical \nRichardson number and associated mixing. These changes in the region between the sills may \nexplain the increased mixing between sills found in observations (Johnsson et al., 2007). Since the \nfocus here has been to explain the enhanced mixing between the sills in the Ringdals fjord \u2013 \nIdefjord system, the sill separation D was fixed at 1.5km. However there is nothing special about \nthis value. Additional calculations (not presented) showed that standing internal tides and \nenhanced mixing persisted as D was increased upto the point where D was comparable with the \nwavelength of the internal tide generated at a single sill (in this case 20km). Naturally as D was \nincreased beyond this, interaction between the sills reduced, and the solution converged to the \nsingle sill case. A detailed discussion of this is beyond the scope of this paper, but calculations \naimed at determining the role of D, upon mixing and internal tidal energy flux are in progress. \n \nThe application of a two dimensional cross section \u201cslice\u201d model of the form used here is \nappropriate in a narrow channel type of region such as a fjord where the flow is constrained by the \nlateral boundaries to be normal to the sill. However in terms of oceanic environments a full three \ndimensional model such as that of Xing and Davies (1998) would be required. Not withstanding \nthis, these calculations suggest that when internal tides are formed in regions of the ocean where \nthere are adjacent topographic features, such as a shelf edge and offshore seamount, which were \nshown by Xing and Davies (1998) to modify the internal tide, there is the possibility of enhanced \nregions of critical Ri number with associated implications for increased mixing. However, in order \n 11\nto test this a full three dimensional non-hydrostatic high resolution model would be required. \nIncreased mixing in such regions will have important implications for oceanic circulation and \nclimate. In large scale climate models these effects can not be resolved, and they will need to be \nparameterized. In addition to validate such mixing parameterizations in these important regions of \ncomplex topography, it will be essential to make the key measurements in these areas.  \nReferences \n \nBerntsen, J., Xing, J. and Davies, A.M.
