Models that are available range from simple7\nempirical models to comprehensive, physically-based, distributed models that require complex8\nparameterisation, often through inverse modelling methods. SPIDER (Simulating Pesticide In Ditches9\nto assess Ecological Risk) was developed to address this gap and to simulate pesticide exposure within10\nnetworks of small surface water bodies (ditches and streams) in support of ecological risk assessment11\nfor pesticides. SPIDER is a locally distributed, capacitance-based model that accounts for pesticide12\nentry into surface water bodies via spray drift, surface runoff, interlayer flow and drainflow and that13\ncan be used for small agricultural catchments. This paper provides a detailed description of the model.14\n15\nKeywords: Catchment, Model, Pesticide, Drainage, Surface water, Risk assessment16\n31\n1. Introduction2\n3\nUnderstanding and managing the potential for impacts of pesticides on the aquatic environment4\nrelies on a comparison between estimated exposure concentrations in water bodies (primarily field-5\nedge systems comprising ditches, ponds and streams; FOCUS, 2002) and endpoints from a series of6\necotoxicity tests. A significant amount is known about fate of pesticides applied to fields (e.g. Flury,7\n1996; Wauchope, 1996) and monitoring data at the catchment level indicate presence of certain8\npesticides in large water bodies (e.g. IFEN, 2002; Environment Agency, 2003). There is a clear need9\nto understand and simulate behaviour of pesticides at the linking scale of small, field-edge water10\nbodies. Indeed, the agricultural landscape as a cohesive unit comprising one or several farms is11\nincreasingly the scale of relevance for managing the way that pesticides are used.12\nPesticide fate models that are currently available and could be considered for application in13\nsimulation of small catchments can be divided into three groups (Table 1). The RIVWQ model14\n(Williams et al., 1999) is an example of a field-scale model applied at the catchment level. The tool15\nlinks multiple unit-area simulations of the PRZM model (Carsel et al., 2000) to account for variations16\nin land use, soil and weather across a watershed and an advection-dispersion model to address17\nchemical fate and transport in the receiving water. The models that incorporate flow routing to and18\nwithin surface water and have the flexibility to represent spatial heterogeneity in properties across the19\ncatchment are better matched to the task. There are large differences in purpose, scale, complexity and20\nprocess descriptions.21\nThe SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model has been developed by USDA to assess the22\neffect of management decisions on water, sediment, nutrient and pesticide yields in large river basins.23\n(Arnold et al., 1998). SWAT is a physically-based, spatially-related model that compiles information24\nabout weather, soil properties, topography, natural vegetation, and cropping practices within a25\ncustomised ArcView Interface. Sub-basins are divided into hydrologic response units that are26\nunconnected units with the same landuse and soil. Algorithms governing movement of soluble and27\nsorbed forms of pesticide from land areas to the stream network were taken from EPIC (Williams,28\n1995). SWAT incorporates a simple mass balance developed by Chapra (1997) to model the29\n4transformation and transport of pesticides in streams represented as a well-mixed layer of water1\noverlying a homogenous sediment layer.2\nMIKE-SHE is a fully distributed, continuous application model (time step 15 to 120 minutes)3\ndesigned to incorporate all major land components of the hydrologic cycle, including overland sheet4\nflow, channel flow, unsaturated sub-surface flow and saturated groundwater flow (Refsgaard and5\nStorm, 1995). Additional modules allow simulation of transport of pesticides and other solutes,6\nincluding specific descriptions of biodegradation and transport via macropore flow. The model is7\nintended for application at scales from field to large watershed. The model requires a detailed set of8\ninput parameters to simulate pesticide transport at the catchment scale and this restricts its use to the9\nstudy and management of highly characterised catchments. Recently, the model has been used as the10\nbasis for the pesticide registration tool PestSurf proposed for use in Denmark (Styczen et al, 2004).11\nThe MIKE-SHE model has been calibrated against detailed monitoring data for two catchments in12\nDenmark. To reduce simulation time, all the water calculations are carried out in advance and cannot13\nbe changed by the user. The scenarios are built into an interface that allows the user to input14\ninformation about properties and usage of the pesticide and to access results of the simulation.15\nThe POPPIE (Prediction of Pesticide Pollution in the Environment) system is a GIS-based16\ncatchment scale model developed by the UK Environment Agency to predict concentrations of17\nagricultural pesticides at the outlet of catchments throughout England and Wales (Brown et al., 2002).18\nThe aim is to support the design of pesticide monitoring programmes. The surface water model19\nembedded in POPPIE (SWATCATCH) is a semi-empirical, distributed model based upon the20\ncalculation of flows and pesticide concentrations contributed by each soil hydrological type within a21\nspecific catchment. The performance of the model has been assessed in a validation exercise22\ncomparing simulations of frequency of detections, maximum concentrations and time series of23\nexposure versus monitoring data for 29 catchments of varying character and size (Brown et al., 2002).24\nRoutine use of catchment models for assessment and management of pesticides requires a tool that25\nis both comprehensive in being able to address all major routes of entry of pesticides into surface26\nwater (spray drift, surface runoff and drainage) and that has reasonable parameter requirements.27\n5MIKE-SHE is the most comprehensive model available at present, but it can only be applied following1\ncalibration against data from detailed monitoring programmes. Other models have mainly been2\nderived in the United States and focus primarily on transport of pesticides in surface runoff. This paper3\npresents a new model, SPIDER (Simulating Pesticides In Ditches to assess Ecological Risk) that was4\ndeveloped to address a gap in the available models. The aims for the model were to (a) account for5\npesticide entry into surface waters via the most important pathways with particular attention to entry6\nvia subsurface drains, (b) capture spatial variability within small catchments, (c) restrict the7\nparameters as far as possible to those that can be easily measured or estimated, and (d) operate on a8\ntime-step that would capture transient peaks in concentration in surface water. A companion paper9\n(Renaud and Brown, submitted) benchmarks the field transport component against the dual-porosity10\nmodel MACRO which has been widely applied in simulating transport of pesticide through soil.11\n12\n2. Model description13\n14\n2.1. Conceptualisation15\n16\nSPIDER is a research model that is locally distributed whereby the landscape is divided into a17\nseries of fields and ditch\/stream segments. Computations are carried on an hourly time step. SPIDER18\nis conceptualised for landscapes with high densities of ditches with a majority of the fields being19\ndrained and for wet-winter conditions such as those found in northern Europe. Ditches and streams are20\nhydrologically connected to fields and receive pesticides dissolved in water originating from the fields21\nvia runoff, interlayer flow or drainflow. They can also receive pesticides directly via spray drift. Water22\nand pesticides are then routed through the series of ditches and stream segments to the outlet of the23\ncatchment. SPIDER is intended to simulate pesticide concentrations in catchments of up to 10 km2;24\nthis limitation is a practical constraint rather than a computational one.25\nThe model has two major modules. The first relates to processes taking place in the fields. In this26\npart, movement and fate of water and pesticides is simulated in crops (if present) and in the soil. The27\nsoil profile is automatically divided into layers of no more than 10 cm thickness and computations are28\ncarried out in sequence in each layer. In addition, the A horizon is subdivided into a 2-cm thick29\n6\u201cmixing layer\u201d that allows applied pesticides to mix with the soil water and the horizon containing1\ndrains has a 10-cm thick \u201cdrained\u201d layer centred on the depth of the drains. SPIDER is a capacitance2\nmodel whereby water is assumed to move under gravity alone when some threshold values of water3\ncontent are reached. The second module relates to processes in ditch and stream segments. Each4\nsegment is associated with one or several fields and water is routed using the Muskingum method.5\nSPIDER was developed to be as flexible as possible, namely (a) there are no restrictions on the6\nlength in time of the simulation; (b) there are no limits on the number of fields that can be simulated;7\n(c) a pesticide can be applied on multiple occasions throughout a simulation period and some of the8\nproperties associated with the pesticide can be changed at each application; and (d) SPIDER allows for9\nseveral crops to be simulated for each individual field, and the crops can be different in successive10\nseasons.11\nSPIDER was coded using the object-oriented C++ language to facilitate updating and12\nimprovement. In the present version, input files are entered manually into a Microsoft Access13\ndatabase. The requirement for separate parameters for each field or ditch imposes the practical14\nlimitation on the scale of application for SPIDER. In addition, two weather files are required: one15\ncontaining hourly rainfall data and one containing daily values for maximum and minimum air16\ntemperature, relative humidity, global solar radiation and wind speed. The latter file is used to17\ncompute daily reference evapotranspiration.18\n19\n2.2. Evapotranspiration20\n21\nDaily reference evapotranspiration (ETr) is calculated with the FAO Penman-Monteith equation22\n(Allen et al., 1998):23\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf0292\n2\n34.01\n273\n900\n408.0\nu\neeu\nT\nGR\nET\nas\na\nn\nr \uf02b\uf02b\uf044\n\uf02d\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\uf02d\n\uf03d \uf067\n\uf067\n24\nwhere ETr is in mm d-1, Rn is the net radiation at the crop surface (MJ m-2 d-1), G is the soil heat flux25\ndensity (MJ m-2 d-1), Ta is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height (\uf0b0C), u2 is the wind speed at 226\n7m height (m s-1), es is the saturation vapour pressure (kPa), ea is the actual vapour pressure (kPa), \uf044 is1\nthe slope of the vapour pressure curve (kPa \uf0b0C-1), and \uf067 is the psychrometric constant (kPa \uf0b0C-1). Input2\nparameters required to calculate ETr are elevation, longitude, maximum and minimum daily3\ntemperatures, daily average relative humidity, daily global radiation, wind speed and height of4\nmeasurement for wind speed. As suggested by Allen et al. (1998), G is not computed in the model and5\nis set to zero.6\nHourly ETr is determined by considering the times of sunrise and sunset. Actual crop7\nevapotranspiration is calculated by multiplying ETr with crop and water stress coefficients that are8\ncalculated with a minor modification of the method of Allen et al. (1998) to account for a9\nheterogeneous soil:10\n11\n\uf071KKETET cra \uf0d7\uf0d7\uf03d12\n13\nwhere ETa is the actual evapotranspiration (mm h-1), Kc is the crop coefficient (-), and K\uf071 (-) is a14\ncoefficient that accounts for water stress.15\nReference crop evapotranspiration (ETr) is calculated for a well watered hypothetical grass crop16\n(Allen et al., 1998). Ground cover, canopy properties and aerodynamic resistance of the crop will be17\ndifferent for another crop and will also vary with crop growth stage. The agricultural season is broken18\ndown into several crop growth stages (\u2018initial\u2019, \u2018crop development\u2019, \u2018mid-season\u2019 and \u2018late season\u2019)19\nand a Kc value is assigned to each. Values of Kc are linearly interpolated between these stages.20\nDuration of each stage and the equivalent Kc values can be obtained from Allen et al. (1998). A value21\nof 1.0 is assigned to Kc when no crop is present.22\nThe factor K\uf071 accounts for any water stresses the crop is subjected to. This coefficient typically23\nvaries between 0.3 and 1.0, the latter value reflecting no water stress. It is calculated with (Allen et al.,24\n1998):25\n26\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\uf0e5 \uf0d7\uf02d\uf03d\ni\nipwpifc FracRootTAW \uf071\uf07127\n8\uf028 \uf029\uf0e5 \uf0d7\uf02d\uf03d\ni\niiifcr FracRootD )()( \uf071\uf0711\n\uf028 \uf029 TAWp\nDTAW\nK r\n\uf0d7\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf03d\n1\uf071\n2\n3\nwhere TAW is the total available water in the root zone (mm), \uf071fc is the soil water at field capacity4\n(mm), \uf071pwp is the soil water content at permanent wilting point (mm), \uf071i is the initial water content at5\nthe beginning of the simulation time step (mm), Dr is the root zone depletion (mm), p is the fraction of6\nTAW that a crop can extract from the root zone without suffering a water stress (set at 0.5), FracRoot7\nis the fraction of the soil layer occupied by crop roots (-), and i indicates the number for those soil8\nlayers occupied by crop roots. Dr cannot be < 0 and K\uf071 cannot be > 1.9\nCalculations in Allen et al. (1998) are simplified because the soil is assumed homogeneous. In10\nSPIDER, the soil profile is broken down into several soil layers with different values of \uf071fc, \uf071pwp and \uf071.11\nWater contents (\uf071fc, TAW, etc) are summed for the A-horizon when there is no crop or the root tip is12\nabove the lower boundary of the A-horizon or over the depth of soil exploited by the roots when the13\nroot tip extends below the A-horizon.14\nWhen roots are present in the soil, water is removed from each layer proportionally to the15\nfraction of root length present in the layer. This implies that, at crop maturity and if there is enough16\nwater in the soil, significant amounts of water can be removed from the horizons below the A-horizon.17\nDuring dry spells, these horizons can dry faster than the A-horizon (which can be re-wetted by small18\nrainfall events) which is an unwanted artefact of our original conceptualisation. To limit this problem,19\nSPIDER will remove water from the A-horizon only once two or more layers below the A-horizon20\nreach permanent wilting point.21\nSPIDER assumes that ditches and streams lose water to the atmosphere via evaporation at a rate22\nthat equals ETr multiplied by a pan coefficient (currently fixed at 0.75).23\n24\n2.3. Crop processes25\n26\n92.3.1. Crop physiology1\n2\nSPIDER simulates root depth (RD), leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of crop cover (FCC) on3\na daily basis. Root depth is modelled according to Borg and Grimes (1986). Leaf area index is4\ncomputed using empirical equations developed for the MACRO model (Larsbo and Jarvis, 2003). The5\nfraction of soil covered by the plant plays an important role for the determination of interception of6\nrainfall and sprayed pesticide. It is assumed that FCC increases linearly from 0 to 0.1 (10% cover)7\nwhich corresponds to the \u2018initial phase\u2019 of crop growth (Allen et al., 1998). This is then followed by a8\nrapid increase until LAI = 3 when it is considered that the crop has reached effective full cover (90%9\ncover). A slightly modified version of the sigmoid curve in LEACHM (Hutson and Wagenet, 1992) is10\nused to describe FCC during that phase. Finally, once LAI starts decreasing after crop maturity, FCC11\nis reduced using the same equation for LAI decrease.12\n13\n2.3.2. Water balance on crop canopies14\n15\nDickinson (1984) suggested that the amount of water stored on a crop was dependent on the leaf16\narea index (LAI):17\nLAIS c \uf0d7\uf03d 2.018\nwhere Sc is the storage capacity of the canopy (mm). The water balance at the crop canopy level (in19\nmm) is then given as:20\n)()()()1()( ttttt PcanEcanRdcancan \uf02d\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d \uf02d\uf071\uf07121\nwhere \uf071can is the water stored in the canopy, Rd is the depth of rain, Ecan is the amount of water lost22\nfrom the canopy through evaporation, Pcan is the amount of rain in excess of Sc that reaches the soil23\nsurface, and t is a time index. Evaporation from the crop canopy is assumed to take place at the24\nreference ET rate. If the canopy is dry, then ETr has to be satisfied by soil evapotranspiration below25\nthe canopy. If the canopy is wet then the portion of ETr required to satisfy Ecan is subtracted from ETr26\nand the remainder of ETr is removed from the soil. Amounts of rain and evaporation received and27\n10\nremoved to\/from the soil surface are calculated after computing rainfall intercepted by the crop canopy1\nand subsequent re-evaporation.2\n3\n2.3.3. Crop pesticide balance4\n5\nThe pesticide mass balance (in mg) in the crop canopy is given by:6\n)()()()1()( ttttt WODegSprayPLcanPLcan \uf02d\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d \uf02d7\nwhere PLcan is the pesticide load on the canopy, Spray is the load intercepted by the crop canopy8\nduring spraying, Deg is the amount of pesticide lost on the crop canopy via degradation and other loss9\nmechanisms and WO is the amount of pesticide washed-off from the crop canopy. Degradation is10\ncomputed using first-order kinetics and the FOCUS (2002) default half-life of 10 days is assumed if no11\ndegradation coefficient is available.

Soil processes19\n20\n2.4.1. Soil temperature21\n22\nField observations have shown that soil temperatures oscillate quasi-symmetrically around an23\naverage temperature (Wu and Nofziger, 1999). A sinusoidal equation was adopted in SPIDER to24\naccount for both the annual and diurnal variations of soil temperature (see Hillel, 1998):25\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0fa\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\uf0eb\n\uf0e9 \uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02d\uf02b\n\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\uf0fa\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\uf0eb\n\uf0e9 \uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02d\uf02b\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\uf03d\nd\ndd\nd\nd\ny\nyy\ny\ny\nyav dd\nzt\ndd\nz\nAmp\ndd\nzt\ndd\nz\nAmp\nTtzT \uf066\uf077\uf066\uf077 sin\nexp\nsin\nexp\n, ,26\n11\n\uf061\uf077\n2\uf03ddd1\n2\n0tt \uf02d\uf03d\uf0663\n4\nwhere T(z,t) is the temperature at depth z and time t (\uf0b0C), Tav,y is the annual average temperature at the5\nsoil surface, Amp is the temperature amplitude at the soil surface (\uf0b0C), dd is the damping depth at6\nwhich the temperature decreases to the fraction 1\/e (mm), \uf077 is the radial frequency and is 2\uf070\/24 for7\nthe daily cycle and 2\uf070\/365 for the annual cycle (h-1 or d-1), \uf066 is the phase constant, the subscripts d and8\ny refer to daily or annual, \uf061 is the soil thermal diffusivity (mm2 h-1) and t0 is the time of day or time of9\nyear when the average temperature occurs.10\n11\nThermal diffusivity is the ratio between the thermal conductivity and the volumetric heat capacity12\n(Hillel, 1998):13\n14\nvC\nK\uf03d\uf06115\nomomqqccaa\nfc\nomomomqqqcccaaaw\nfc\nRfRfRfRfz\nRKfRKfRKfRKfKz\nK\n\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0d7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf03d \uf071\n\uf071\n16\nomomqqccaaw\nfc\nv CfCfCfCfCzC \uf0d7\uf02b\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0d7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf03d \uf07117\n18\nwhere \uf061 is in m2 s-1, \uf071fc is the depth of water at field capacity (mm), z is the thickness of the soil layer19\n(mm), K is the thermal conductivity (J m-1 s-1 K-1), f is the fraction of each constituent (-), R is the ratio20\nof each constituent relative to the water phase (-), C is the specific heat of the constituent (J m-3 K-1),21\nand the subscript a, c, q, and om stand for air, clay, quartz and organic matter, respectively. The22\nfollowing values, reviewed by M\u00fcller (2000) were used: Kw = 0.57, Ka = 0.025, Kc = 2.92, Kq = 8.80,23\nand Kom = 0.25 J m-1 s-1 K-1; Ra = 1.4, and all other ratios are 0.4; Cw = 4.180, Ca = 0.001212, Cc =24\n2.385, Cq = 2.128, and Com = 2.496 (x 106 J m-3 K-1).25\n12\nInformation on the temperature at the soil surface is not usually available. It has therefore been1\nreplaced by air temperature in SPIDER. This approximation will yield an underestimate of soil surface2\ntemperatures when the soil is not covered, but is reasonable when the soil is covered by either a3\ngrowing plant or crop residues. For each soil layer, the soil temperature is calculated at five equidistant4\npoints (including the layer boundaries) and an average soil temperature is determined for each layer.5\nOne difficulty of the above soil temperature equation is to determine the daily and annual values of t0.6\nAn estimate of t0 can be obtained by looking at daily and annual soil surface (or air) temperature7\nfluctuations.8\n9\n2.4.2. Soil water balance10\n11\nWater movement as simulated by SPIDER depends on the water status of each soil layer. The12\nreference soil water contents used for computation of water movement are:13\n\uf0b7 Permanent wilting point (\uf071pwp): in SPIDER, \uf071 \u2265 \uf071pwp.14\n\uf0b7 Field capacity (\uf071fc): this value is the trigger for vertical and lateral water movement. If \uf071 \uf0a315\n\uf071fc, water will not be transferred from one layer to the next. If \uf071 > \uf071fc then water in excess16\nof \uf071fc is allowed to move.17\n\uf0b7 The water content at the boundary between micropores and macropores (\uf071macro): this value18\nis a water content greater than \uf071fc but smaller than \uf071sat. It represents the water content at19\nwhich the micropore region is completely full and the macropore region is completely20\nempty. If at any stage \uf071 > \uf071macro then water is allowed to move rapidly to the next layer21\n(within the limit of the saturated hydraulic conductivity). If \uf071fc < \uf071 < \uf071macro, water22\nmovement will be a function of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil. This23\nallows for a separation of the flow domain into rapid and slow water movement to account24\nfor any preferential flow.25\n\uf0b7 Saturation (\uf071sat): \uf071 cannot exceed \uf071sat.26\nFor each soil layer the water balance (in mm) is given by:27\n13\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029tttttattsoiltt RuDLMPETIrrR \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d \uf02d1\uf071\uf0711\nwhere \uf071 is the soil water content, Rsoil is the depth of rainfall reaching the soil surface, Irr is irrigation2\nreaching the soil surface, ETa is the actual evapotranspiration from the soil surface, P is percolation,3\nLM is lateral movement, D is drainage, and Ru is runoff. LM, D and Ru are mutually exclusive in4\nSPIDER, meaning that the surface soil layer can only generate runoff, the soil layer containing the5\ndrains can only generate drainflow, and all other layers can only generate lateral flow.6\n7\n2.4.3. Soil hydraulic properties8\n9\nAll the hydraulic properties of the soil can be entered directly by the modeller. Pedotransfer10\nfunctions (PTF\u2019s) can be used if these properties are not known. The PTF\u2019s used are those reported by11\nEvans et al. (1999), and they allow for the estimation of the van Genuchten parameters, saturated and12\nresidual water contents, water contents at field capacity and wilting point, air capacity and saturated13\nhydraulic conductivity.14\n15\n2.4.4. Infiltration16\n17\nRainfall patterns in northern Europe are characterised by low-intensity long-duration events, so the18\ntreatment of infiltration was kept simple: within an hourly time step all the rainfall is assumed to19\ninfiltrate the mixing layer. Any water in excess of field capacity within this layer is transmitted to the20\nnext layer. However if after vertical transfer of water to the next layer \uf071 > \uf071sat then runoff is generated.21\n22\n2.4.5. Runoff23\n24\nRunoff is generated in two ways. First, when rainfall intensity exceeds the saturated hydraulic25\nconductivity of the soil (Ks):26\n14\nSsoil KRRu \uf02d\uf03d1\nSecond, when rain falls on an already saturated soil and after having accounted for percolation2\n(particularly active in undrained fields):3\nsatRu \uf071\uf071 \uf02d\uf03d4\nwhere \uf071sat is the saturated water content (mm).5\n6\n2.4.6. Percolation7\n8\nPercolation is handled differently depending on the position in the soil profile. This is done to9\nallow preferential flow in the region above drains and to control the lower boundary condition. For10\nhorizons above the drained layer, it is assumed that water in excess of \uf071macro moves at a rate equal to11\nthe saturated hydraulic conductivity. Therefore when \uf071 > \uf071macro:12\n\uf028 \uf029macroSKP \uf071\uf071 \uf02d\uf03d ,min113\nwhere P1 is the amount of water percolating at this stage of computation (mm), and KS is the saturated14\nhydraulic conductivity of the layer (mm h-1). To determine \uf071macro the modeller needs to input a tension15\nvalue (< tension at field capacity) that characterises the state when macropores are empty. A rough16\nguideline for \uf071macro is the water content at \u20131 kPa.17\nIf at this stage of the computation P1 < KS, more water is allowed to percolate. As soil hydraulic18\nconductivity decreases rapidly with decreasing values of \uf071, a step function is used at this second stage19\n(P2). Within the one-hour time step, time remaining for percolation (after having allowed macropore20\nflow) is calculated:21\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf02d\uf03d\nSK\nP\nTimeAv 1122\nwhere TimeAv is the remaining time available for percolation within the 1-h time step (h). If TimeAv >23\n0, water content and percolation are calculated by dividing TimeAv into equally spaced intervals:24\n15\nNbInt\nTimeAv\nTimeInt \uf03d1\nwhere TimeInt is the length of the time interval (h) and NbInt is the number of intervals required. For2\neach one of these intervals the updated \uf071 is used to calculate an unsaturated hydraulic conductivity,3\nwhich is used for the next interval:4\n\uf028 \uf029fcu TimeIntKP \uf071\uf071 \uf02d\uf0d7\uf03d ,min25\nwhere Ku is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (mm h-1). The computation for P2 is repeated NbInt6\ntimes or terminated when \uf071 = \uf071fc, whichever comes first. At the end of each computation, P2 is updated7\nwith the amount of percolation that was just calculated:8\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n6\n1\n,22\nNbInt\nNbIntPP9\nThe percolation for the 1-h time interval is P = P1 + P2.10\nIf at the start of the computation the macropores were empty (\uf071 < \uf071macro) but \uf071 > \uf071fc, percolation is11\ncalculated with TimeAv set to 1 h and NbInt = 10. The methodology reported above is then followed.12\nCalculations of water percolation in the layers below the drained layer are simplified. The initial13\nsoil water content is first used to calculate Ku. Percolation is then computed with:14\n\uf028 \uf029fcuKP \uf071\uf071 \uf02d\uf03d ,min15\nFinally, the modeller specifies a groundwater recharge value and if \uf071 > \uf071fc in the deepest layer of16\nthe soil profile, that recharge value is the maximum rate of vertical water movement out of the profile.17\nWater lost as recharge is currently assumed to leave the system and does not feed into the ditches at a18\nlater stage.19\n20\n2.4.7. Lateral movement21\n22\nIf after percolation \uf071 > \uf071fc, additional water can be removed laterally as interlayer flow. This only23\nconcerns parts of the soil profile that are above the bottom elevation of a ditch (i.e. only water that can24\n16\nbe directly intercepted by a ditch or stream is allowed to move laterally). The subroutine for lateral1\nwater movement is based on the kinematic storage model of Sloan and Moore (1984) also used in2\nSWAT (Neitsch et al., 2002). The sequence of calculations involves the determination of the drainable3\nwater volume, the drainable porosity, the saturated thickness, the flow velocity, and the discharge:4\n\uf028 \uf029 310\uf02d\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf02d\uf03d FieldLDrainabVol fc\uf071\uf0715\n\uf028 \uf029\ndepth\nDrainabPor fcs\n\uf071\uf071 \uf02d\n\uf03d6\nFieldLDrainabPor\nDrainabVol\nSatThick\n\uf0b4\n\uf03d 27\n\uf028 \uf029 310sin \uf02d\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03d \uf062lKFlowVel8\nFlowVelSatThickDisch \uf0b4\uf03d9\nFieldL\nDisch\nLM\n1000\uf03d10\nwhere DrainabVol is the drainable volume of water stored in the saturated zone per unit width (m2),11\nFieldL is the field length (m), DrainabPor is the drainable porosity (-), depth is the depth of the soil12\nlayer (mm), SatThick is the saturated thickness (m), FlowVel is the flow velocity (m h-1), Kl is the13\n(un)saturated lateral conductivity (mm h-1), \uf062 is the slope angle (rad), and Disch is the discharge (m2 h-14\n1).15\n16\n2.4.8. Drainage17\n18\nOne of two conditions is required for drainflow to be generated. First, when the layer below the19\ndrained horizon is saturated and \uf071 > \uf071fc in the drained horizon or secondly, when a perched water table20\nis formed in the drained horizon. For the first case, drainage depth is determined by:21\n\uf028 \uf029fcSKD \uf071\uf071 \uf02d\uf03d ,min22\n17\nwith \uf071 \uf0a3 \uf071sat. Considering the second case, a perched water table is formed when \uf071 > \uf071fc. The1\nproportion of saturated soil is first calculated (the rest of the horizon being kept at field capacity) and2\nonce the saturated layer exceeds an arbitrarily defined threshold, drainflow is generated:3\n\uf028 \uf029\nfcvsatv\nfcvv zDS\n,,\n,\n\uf071\uf071\n\uf071\uf071\n\uf02d\n\uf0b4\uf02d\uf03d4\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d\uf028 \uf029ThDSKD fcvsatvs \uf02d\uf0b4\uf02d\uf03d ,,,min \uf071\uf0715\nwhere DS is the thickness of the saturated layer (mm), \uf071v are the volumetric water contents of the soil6\n(mm3 mm-3), the subscript fc and sat stand for field capacity and saturation, and drainflow is generated7\nwhen DS > Th (mm). Th is arbitrarily set at 25 mm. If during the second phase of the water balance8\ncalculation (i.e. when the model ensures that \uf071 < \uf071sat in all layers) water is moved from the layer below9\nthe drained horizon and this brings \uf071 above field capacity, then more drainage can be generated.10\nHowever, the total drainage cannot exceed Ks.11\n12\n2.4.9. Pesticide balance13\n14\nCalculations for the soil pesticide balance vary depending on the type of layer being considered15\nand whether preferential flow was allowed or not. The pesticide mass balance (in mg) for each layer16\nis:17\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029tttttttt LMLDrLRLSDLPLILPestLPestL \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d \uf02d118\nwhere PestL is the pesticide load in the layer, IL are any inputs to the layer via application, spray drift,19\nleaf washoff, or percolation from a layer above, PL is the pesticide load transmitted via percolation,20\nSDL is the amount of pesticide lost via degradation, RL is the pesticide load in runoff, DrL is the21\npesticide load in drainage, and LML is the pesticide load in lateral flow.22\nThe first step to calculate pesticide concentration in soil and water is to determine the volume of23\nwater that interacts with each soil layer. For the mixing layer, it consists in summing up the water24\ncontent at the end of the time increment with the volumes of percolation and runoff. For the drainage25\n18\nlayer, runoff is replaced with the volume of drainage and for the other soil layers, runoff is replaced1\nwith interlayer flow.2\nThe pesticide input to the soil layer is given by:3\nMixing layer: \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029100_1 \uf0d7\uf0d7\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d \uf02d SAApplPestPLPestLPestL ttitt4\nAll other layers: \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029ttt PLPestLPestL \uf02b\uf03d \uf02d15\nwhere PLi are inputs other than direct application (e.g. pesticide washoff from leaves in mg),6\nPest_Appl is the pesticide application rate corrected for interception (kg ha-1), SA is the surface area of7\nthe field (m2) and the factor \u2018100\u2019 is used to convert units.8\nOnce the pesticide load in the soil layer is known, the pesticide concentration in water is9\ncalculated:10\n\uf028 \uf029SMPCkSWPCPL Nwfw \uf0d7\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0d7\uf03d11\nwhere PCw is the pesticide concentration in soil water (mg L-1), kf is the Freundlich sorption coefficient12\n(mL g-1), N is the Freundlich exponent (-), SW is the volume of water in the layer (L), and SM is the13\nmass of soil solids in the soil layer (kg). In the model, kf is calculated from koc and organic carbon14\ncontent values provided by the modeller. This is not a fixed requirement, giving the user the flexibility15\nto include influences on sorption of soil characteristics other than organic carbon.16\nA different computation scheme is followed in regions where preferential flow takes place. When17\ncalculating pesticide concentration in layer n, SPIDER first compares the volume of macropore water18\nreceived by layer n from layer n-1 and the volume of macropore water leaving layer n (Pma). There are19\ntwo possible situations:20\n\uf0b7 First, Pma(n) \u2265 Pma(n-1). In this case, water and pesticide are transmitted from the soil matrix of21\nlayer n to the macropore domain of layer n. This movement of water also transfers pesticide22\nfrom one domain to the other.23\n\uf0b7 Second, Pma(n) < Pma(n-1). The reverse of the above takes place, i.e. water and pesticide is24\nmoved from the macropore domain to the soil matrix.25\n19\nAfter transferring water and pesticide between the two domains, PCw is computed separately in the1\ntwo pore regions of the layer. The amount of soil available for interaction with pesticides in the two2\nflow domains is given by:3\nmama fSMSM \uf0d7\uf03d and mami SMSMSM \uf02d\uf03d4\nwhere fma is the fraction of the total sorption capacity of the soil that is associated with macropores (-),5\nand the subscripts ma and mi stand for macro and micropore, respectively.6\nFinally, pesticide transmitted via micropore flow in the drain layer is added to the layer but7\npesticide originating from macropore flow is directed straight to the drain and does not interact with8\nthe soil matrix. The amount of pesticide lost from each layer is calculated for each hydrological route9\n(i.e. percolation plus runoff, interlayer flow or drainflow). It is assumed that in the mixing layer,10\npesticide is homogeneously mixed with the soil. However, the pesticide load moving via percolation to11\nthe next layer is split into pesticide moving via preferential flow and pesticide moving via matrix flow.12\nThis is done proportionate to the respective amounts of water flowing in these two domains.13\nPesticide degradation follows first-order kinetics:14\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n24\n1\nk\ntt ePestLPestL\n\uf02d\n\uf02d \uf0d7\uf03d15\nwhere k is the degradation coefficient (h-1) and the computation is carried out for a 1-h time step. The16\npesticide degradation coefficient can be adjusted according to the soil temperature (with the Arrhenius17\nequation) and water content (Walker, 1973):18\n19\n\uf028 \uf029 B\nref\nTrefTR\nTrefTa\nrefTrefT\ntz\ntz\nekk \uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf03d \uf0d7\uf0d7\n\uf02d\uf0d7\uf045\n\uf071\n\uf071\n\uf071\uf071\n),(\n),(\n,, if T > 020\n0, \uf03d\uf071Tk if T \uf0a3 021\n22\nwhere kT,\uf071 is the degradation coefficient at temperature T and soil water content \uf071 (d-1), kTref,\uf071ref is the23\ndegradation rate determined at the reference temperature and water content (d-1), \uf045a is the activation24\nenergy (normally 54000 J mol-1), T(z,t) is the soil temperature (K), Tref is the reference temperature at25\nwhich the degradation coefficient was calculated (K), R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol-1 K-1), \uf071ref is26\n20\nthe reference \uf071 at which the degradation coefficient was calculated (mm), considered to be field1\ncapacity in the model, and B is a moisture exponent generally set at 0.7 (-). If the modeller specifies2\nthat the degradation rate constant (k) was determined from field measurements, then no correction for3\n\uf071 and T are applied. Finally, the degradation rate is also adjusted for depth in the soil profile.4\n5\n2.5. Flow routing and pesticide fate in ditches6\n7\n2.5.1. Water balance8\n9\nThe water balance in each ditch segment is given by (all in m3):10\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029tttttttt InfEWOBFWIDRVV \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d \uf02d111\nwhere V is the volume of water in the ditch, DR is the volume of rain falling on the ditch, WI12\nrepresents the inputs of water to the ditch from the fields or other ditch segments, BF is baseflow, E is13\nthe volume of evaporation from the ditch, Inf is the amount of infiltration into the sediment bed of the14\nditch, and t is a time increment that can be smaller than 1 h (see below). The following assumptions15\nare made:16\n\uf0b7 All water inputs are added to the top-end of the ditch and the water is then routed through the17\nditch segment. Evaporation is subtracted from the input volume or, if no water is added to a18\nditch segment, from the volume of water already present in the ditch.19\n\uf0b7 The ditches are composed of two reservoirs, one for stagnant water and one for flowing20\nwater. This gives the modeller some flexibility if some ditches have obstacles that stop water21\nfrom flowing altogether.22\n\uf0b7 Infiltration in the sediment bed only takes place when the drains are not flowing. It is23\nassumed here that when drains are flowing, the water table is high and therefore infiltration24\nis restricted.25\n21\n\uf0b7 In the current version of SPIDER, baseflow is a direct input value from the modeller. It is1\nalso assumed that baseflow remains constant over the simulation period.2\nWater input to a ditch or to a stream is routed using the Muskingum method (e.g. Fread, 1993;3\nViessman and Lewis, 1996):4\n\uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05dOxIxKS m \uf02d\uf02b\uf03d 15\nwhere S is storage (m3), I is inflow (m3 s-1), O is outflow (m3 s-1), x is a parameter that establishes the6\nrelative importance of I and O (-) and Km is a proportionality coefficient (s). The parameter x varies7\nbetween 0.0 and 0.5. If inflow and outflow data are available x and Km can be calculated (e.g.8\nViessman and Lewis, 1996). In the absence of inflow and outflow data, x can be set at 0.2 and Km9\napproximated by the travel time between two points in the reach.10\nCombining the equation above with the continuity equation and solving in finite difference form gives:11\nt\nSSOOII\n\uf044\n\uf02d\uf03d\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b 122121\n22\n12\nwere \uf044t are time increments and the subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the beginning and end of the13\nincrements.

As the equation is solved using finite difference, numerical stability must be19\nsatisfied and the time increment needs to be selected so that 2Kx < \uf044t < 2K(1-x). This is done20\nautomatically in the model, meaning that if \uf044t needs to be smaller than 1 h (the time step of the21\nmodel), intermediate calculations are automatically carried out but if \uf044t needs to be greater than 1 h,22\n22\nthe user is prompted to select longer reach lengths for the simulation. Regardless of the value of \uf044t, the1\nmodel generates and hourly output of the outflow (O2).2\nThe difficulty with assimilating Km to the travel time is that the latter varies with flow stage. For3\nexample, Km can be estimated using the following equations (Viessman and Lewis, 1996):4\nn\nSlRh\nv\n2132\n\uf03d5\nvc\n3\n5\uf03d6\nc\nL\nK \uf03d7\n8\nwhere the first equation is Manning\u2019s equation for velocity in a channel, v is the average flow velocity9\n(m s-1), Rh is the hydraulic radius of the flow (m), Sl is the slope of the channel bed (m m-1), n is a10\ncoefficient that varies with the channels roughness properties (-), c is the kinematic wave velocity (m11\ns-1) and L is the length of the ditch (m). The 5\/3 coefficient in the second equation above characterises12\na wide triangular channel. Rh is the ratio of the cross sectional area of the flow (A) and the wetted13\nperimeter of the flow (Pw) (Neitsch et al., 2002):14\n2dzdWA b \uf02b\uf03d15\n212 zdWPw b \uf02b\uf02b\uf03d16\nwhere Wb is the ditch width at the bottom (m), d is the flow depth (m), and Z is the inverse of the side17\nslope of the ditch and can be calculated with:18\nc\ntb\nd\nWW\nZ\n2\n\uf02d\uf03d19\nwhere Wt is the ditch\u2019s top width and dc is the ditch\u2019s depth. As can be seen from the set of equations20\nabove, Km will vary with d, whereas theoretically, Km should be a constant parameter for a given reach.21\nThe variation in Km affects the calculation of the outflow so a \u201crepresentative\u201d value of Km needs to be22\n23\ndetermined. For example, in SWAT, Km is calculated by assuming a full ditch and a ditch that is a1\ntenth full, with one weighing coefficient assigned to both Km values (Neitsch et al., 2002). For the2\npresent version of SPIDER, Km is arbitrarily calculated assuming a half-full ditch.3\nFlow can be routed in the ditch once Km and x are determined but the computation time (CT) has to4\nbe within the range 2KX < CT < 2K(1-X). If this is not the case the ditch has to be segmented and a5\nnew Km computed. SPIDER computes Km and CT for every ditch, then selects the shortest CT and uses6\nthat value to route water in all ditches. In a landscape with ditches of different sizes, the selected CT is7\nunlikely to respect the numerical criteria above for every ditch. Some ditches may therefore need to be8\nsegmented until the selected CT can be applied to them. This is done automatically in SPIDER. The9\ncharacteristics of each new segment are identical to those of the original ditch with the exceptions of10\n(1) ditch length, (2) ditch Km, and (3) the number of the ditches and fields it is associated with in the11\nlandscape. Water routing in the ditches is carried out in sequence, starting with the upstream segments.12\nAn artificial time delay is added to prevent water from the first ditch reaching the outlet of the13\ncatchment within one time step which, when the programme runs on a sub-hourly time step, would14\nprove unrealistic in many situations. Therefore, outputs from one ditch segment are only transmitted to15\nthe next ditch segment during the following time step.16\n17\n2.5.2. Pesticide inputs to ditches dissolved in water18\n19\nThe hydrological routes for pesticide entry in ditches are drainflow, surface runoff and interlayer20\nflow. Only soil layers above the bottom depth of the ditches contribute interlayer flow to a ditch. The21\nload of pesticide in each contributing soil layer is added to the loads from drainflow and surface22\nrunoff. These operations are carried out on an hourly basis. The total load of pesticide is then assumed23\nto enter the ditch in its top section and is therefore allowed to interact with the entire length of the24\nditch. If the time step for flow routing in the ditch is smaller than 1 h, pesticides inputs to ditches are25\ndivided proportionally to the fraction of time at which the computations are carried out.26\n27\n2.5.3. Pesticide inputs to ditches via spray drift28\n24\n1\nSPIDER checks whether the wind runs over the sprayed field before reaching the ditch by comparing wind2\ndirection and the ditch orientation. Clearly if a ditch is upwind of a sprayed field, no spray drift needs to3\nbe computed. Spray drift calculations are only initiated if the receiving ditch has water in it, though a4\nfuture development could consider suspension of pesticide on rewetting of a dry ditch.5\nTo determine total drift loading to the ditch, basic spray drift is integrated over the width of the6\nwater body using the approach of FOCUS (2002):7\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029112\n1\n1\n1\n2\n0 \uf02b\uf0d7\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf03d\n\uf02b\uf02b\nbzz\nzza\nD\nbb\n8\nwhere D0 is the basic integrated spray drift (%), a is the y-intercept of the basic spray drift equation9\nabove (= 3.7676 in SPIDER), b is the exponent of the basic spray drift equation above (= -09786 in10\nSPIDER), and z1 and z2 are the distances of the near and far water edges from the spray nozzle (m).11\nThe distributed nature of the model means that it was important to have the potential to include12\ninterception of spray drift by vegetation in the zone between treated area and waterbody (Int). This is13\ndone on the basis of height of the intervening vegetation (C. Butler-Ellis, pers comm.) and is thus only14\napplicable for dense vegetation (e.g. scrubland, hedges in full leaf):15\n]1.0[833.0 \uf02d\uf03d VHInt D \u2265 016\nwhere VH is the margin vegetation height (m) with a default value of 0.1 m (no interception).17\nFinally, the angle of incidence between the wind direction and the ditch is calculated.18\nComputations for spray drift generally assume that wind direction is perpendicular to the field. This is19\nseldom the case in a natural setting so an additional factor is added. A simple ratio of the angle of20\nincidence to 90\uf0b0 (right angle) is calculated. Final spray drift is:21\nCADD f 0\uf03d22\nwhere Df is the final percent drift entering the water body (%) and CA is an angle correction factor (-).23\nTotal pesticide load to the ditch is given by:24\nDWDLADSDL rfsd \uf0d7\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf03d25\n25\nwhere SDLsd is the pesticide load due to spray drift (mg), Ar is the pesticide application rate (kg ha-1),1\nand DL and DW are ditch length and ditch width, respectively (m).2\n3\n2.5.4. Pesticide fate in ditches4\n5\nPesticide fate in ditches is determined after hydrological routing has been carried out and is6\ncomputed at the same time step used for routing. The pesticide mass balance is given by (all in mg):7\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029tttttt DPLDDDPODPIDLDPTL \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d \uf02d18\nwhere DPTL is the total pesticide load in the ditch which comprises pesticide in water and pesticide in9\nsediment, DPI is the pesticide input to the ditch, DPO is the amount of pesticide transmitted to the10\nnext ditch segment or reaching the catchment outlet, DPD is degradation, DPL is percolation and t is a11\ntime increment equivalent to CT. It is assumed that new water inputs displace water already in the12\nditch. Two cases are considered to move the pesticide from ditch to ditch. The first occurs when the13\noutflow at the end of the ditch, O(t) is smaller than the volume of water originally present in the ditch14\nV(t-1). In that scenario, all the calculations are carried out before the new water enters the ditch segment15\n(the new water does not mix with the original water). The sequence of computation is as follows: (1)16\npesticide sorption to the ditch sediments, (2) degradation, (3) losses by percolation and (4) losses to17\nthe next ditch. Sorption is calculated as for sorption in soil with the modeller specifying a Freundlich18\ncoefficient (kf) and exponent (N) specific to the bottom sediment. The modeller also needs to specify19\nthe thickness of the sediment layer that the pesticide interacts with. It is assumed that the entire20\nvolume of water in the ditch interacts with the sediment and a default depth for interaction sediment of21\n1 cm is suggested. For degradation, the modeller can specify two degradation rates: one for sediment22\nand one for water. Degradation then follows first-order kinetics as in the soil compartment. Finally, the23\nload of pesticide lost with moving water is computed by multiplying the concentration in water by the24\nrespective volume of water leaving the ditch. At the end of the time step, all incoming pesticide from25\nupstream is added to the ditch. The second situation takes place when O(t) > V(t-1). Here a portion of the26\nincoming water flows through the ditch and exits the ditch within one time step. That water can carry a27\n26\nproportion of the total incoming pesticide load, the latter being allowed to interact with the ditch1\nsediment. The same calculation steps as above are then carried out.2\nDiffusion of pesticide into the sediment layer is not accounted for in the present version of3\nSPIDER. For fast-moving systems, this omission may not be important providing the depth of4\ninteraction between pesticide and sediment is small. In addition, the processes of sorption to5\nsuspended sediments and macrophytes are ignored, but could be added as knowledge on these6\nmechanisms increases (Hand et al., 2001; Moore et al., 2001).7\n8\n3. Conclusions9\n10\nSPIDER was developed to address a gap in the toolbox for aquatic ecological risk assessment for11\npesticides. It is a locally distributed model whereby the landscape is divided into a series of fields and12\nditch\/stream segments. It is conceptualised for landscapes with high densities of ditches, where fields13\nmay be drained and for wet-winter conditions. The model simulates pesticide entry into ditches and14\nstreams via spray drift, surface runoff, interlayer flow and drainflow. Calculations are performed on an15\nhourly time step, thus providing the modeller with a fine-resolution time series of pesticide16\nconcentrations leaving individual fields and in different stretches of ditches and streams throughout17\nthe catchment. Despite this resolution, data requirements for SPIDER remain reasonable and18\ncomputation times are relatively short.19\nA companion paper (Renaud and Brown, submitted) reports on a sensitivity analysis and20\nevaluation against two datasets of the field transport. Results suggest that the model is able to simulate21\npeak concentrations of pesticide in water and predictions for transport in drainflow are very similar to22\nthose from the mechanistic, field-scale model MACRO (Jarvis et al., 1994). Simulations of pesticide23\nconcentrations between events are less accurate (Renaud and Brown, submitted). Several24\nimprovements are currently being considered including: (a) the inclusion of a groundwater store that25\nwould interact with streams; (b) a more refined description of fate of pesticides in ditches (particularly26\ndiffusion into sediment and sorption to macrophytes); and (c) a full graphical user interface.27\n27\n1\nReferences2\n3\nAllen, R.G., Pereira, L.S. , Raes, D., Smith, M., 1998.
