J. Stuart and Margaret I. Brown\nGlasgow University\nemail: S.Stuart@philoso-phy.arts.gla.ac.uk\nIn any discipline, across a wide variety of subjects, there are numerous learning resources\navailable to students. For many students the resources that will be most beneficial to\nthem are quickly apparent but, because of the nature of philosophy and the philosophical\nmethod, it is not immediately clear which resources will be most valuable to students for\nwhom the development of critical thinking skills is crucial. If we are to support these\nstudents effectively in their learning we must establish what these resources are how we\ncan continue to maintain and improve them, and how we can encourage students to make\ngood use of them. In this paper we describe and assess our evaluation of the use made by\nstudents of learning resources in the context of learning logic and in developing their\ncritical thinking skills. We also assess the use of a new resource, electronic handsets, the\npurpose of which is to encourage students to respond to questions in lectures and to gain\nfeedback about how they are progressing with the material.\nIntroduction\nTeaching students to read and think critically is fundamental to philosophy; after all,\naccording to the philosophy benchmarking document, it is hoped that graduates in\nphilosophy will possess a 'precision of thought and expression in the analysis and\nformulation of complex and controversial problems' and, that they will develop the\nabilities to 'abstract, analyse and construct sound arguments and to identify logical\nfallacies' and 'recognise methodological errors, rhetorical devices, unexamined\nconventional wisdom, unnoticed assumptions, vagueness and superficiality' {Philosophy:\nSubject Benchmark Statements, 2000, p. 3). Abilities of this sort come naturally in only a\nlucky few in any generation, and the others are led in their general direction by the teaching\nstrategies that are currently employed in classes on critical thinking, reasoning and logic.\nThe success of these strategies is not altogether clear and new strategies, for example, the\n58\nALT-J Volume 11 Number 3\nproduction of Web resources, are being developed and made available to students with too\nlittle understanding of whether they will actually benefit them.\nAs the lecturer on the three courses - Level 1 'Introduction to Philosophy of Mind' (200\nstudents). Level 2 'Introduction to Logic' (100 students), and Honours-level 'Kantian\nepistemology based on the Prolegomena (1891)' (20 students), I have a particular interest in\ndiscovering whether resources are being employed successfully. A lot of energy and\nimagination has been invested in delivering lectures in a lively and engaging way, in\ncreating handouts and tutorial worksheets, in drawing up reading packs for Level 1 and\nHonours, and in devising electronic course materials for Level 2. It is clearly in my interest\nto find out if I have been spending my time wisely, and if the resources that I encourage the\nstudents to use are in fact the resources that help them to understand the course material\nand to develop their philosophical muscles.\nA characteristic of the Scottish University system, as exemplified in the Arts, Social Science\nand Science Faculties of the University of Glasgow, is to have large pre-Honours classes, and\npre-Honours philosophy is a compulsory component of many Arts degree profiles. As a\nresult, we can find ourselves teaching the full range of philosophical topics to first- and\nsecond-year classes of upwards in total of 800 students, with a wide variation in their\nabilities, in their levels of commitment and motivation, and in their background knowledge;\nall of which can, and do, produce wide variations in individual student performances. It is\npresumed that differently able, committed, motivated or knowledgeable students will respond\nto different resources and teaching strategies in distinct ways. This makes these large, mixed\nclasses an interesting testbed for the effectiveness of a variety of teaching models.\nIt is also presumed that some students will have come to university with effective learning\nstrategies and that, if these strategies transfer well, their success will not be dependent on\nthe resources or teaching models that are employed at this level. Unfortunately, there seems\nno clear way of testing the veracity of this assumption, so for now it will suffice to\nacknowledge it as a possible influencing factor, but one that cannot be investigated any\nfurther at this time.\nWe take as a given that if a student is to be successful in their learning, then recognition of\nwhich resources will serve them best is going to be crucial. In relation to this we must also\nacknowledge that there will be a subjective element in the resources that an individual will\nutilize; however, we do seek to identify whether or not weaker students complete their\ncourse, and complete it successfully, by employing different resources from the students\nwho succeed easily. In particular this will be carried out in relation to the students in a\nsecond year Introduction to Logic class. We have the examination results for those students\nin this class who completed a questionnaire and a comparative analysis of the grade they\nachieved against the learning resources they found valuable is easily possible. This will also\nallow us to establish if there is any robust correlation between the use of particular\nresources and later examination success.\nThe strategy\nAn experienced independent evahiator was employed to carry out the analysis. There were\nthree reasons for this: the first was that a particular set of skills is required for devising\ncomplex questionnaires of this sort; the second was that, as a teacher on the courses, I\n59\nSusan Stuart amd Margaret I. Brown An evaluation of learning resources for teaching formal philosophical methods\nmight have had difficulty eliciting objective - or just plain honest - responses from the\nstudents; and the third was that it would have been too time-consuming to do alongside\nwriting and delivering the lectures.\nWe made use of a model of Integrative Evaluation (Draper, Brown, Henderson and\nMcAteer, 1996) using a resource questionnaire as our main instrument (Brown, Doughty,\nDraper, Henderson and McAteer, 1996). Questionnaires of this sort make it possible to\nmeasure, using student self-report, which resources students use, how much use they made\nof them, and how much they value each of them; thus providing us with both quantitative\nand qualitative information. The resources that were considered included lectures, Web\nresources, set texts, other texts, student-led and non-student-led tutorial discussion,\nelectronic texts and electronic course materials, access to the lecturer, handouts, the\nLibrary, discussions with their tutor, discussions with other students, workshops, the\nTomassi (Web-based) Theorem Prover (Level 2 Logic only) available online at\nhttp:\/\/www.oxford-virtual.com\/Philosophy\/Tomassi\/, class assignments, past examination\npapers, specimen questions, and electronic handsets. This last item was being tried for the\nfirst time in the logic lectures to see if it helped to elicit responses from more students in the\nclass, and also to see if there were particular types of questions that could be answered\nmore easily by students in this way (Stuart and Brown, 2002).\nStudents in all three courses were presented with questionnaires asking them specific\nquestions about what resources they had and had not used, and how useful they felt the\nresources had been in understanding the course material and the development of their\nphilosophical skills. They were also asked to elaborate on their responses where relevant\nand to say if they intended to proceed to Honours in Philosophy. Our aim here was to see if\nthere was a particular set of resources used by those students wishing to take the subject\nfurther.\nThus our study concentrated on the resources used in Levels l and 2, feedback from\nHonours-level students was also gathered so that we could see how resource use changed\nover a prolonged period of study. We also carried out a retrospective study of the resources\nthose Honours students recalled as being most useful in their first and second years and, as\na side study, we conducted a parallel investigation of the reasons students gave for\nprogressing to Honours in Philosophy or the reasons they give for choosing another course\nof study. Our aim was to try and establish whether students moved away from philosophy\nbecause of the methods of teaching, because they did not feel well supported in their study,\nbecause of the subject matter, or simply because they had always intended to take Honours\nin some other course.\nFindings\nHaving looked at both the use and the usefulness of resources as rated by the students it\nwas noticeable that there was a steady increase in the number of resources being used by\nstudents as they progressed through their courses, developing their skills and proceeding to\nthe next year. In Level 1 students used, on average, six or more resources, in Level 2 they\nused eight or more and by the time they reached Honours they were using ten or more.\nThere seems also to be a minimum number of resources - excluding the use of electronic\nhandsets (see penultimate section) - used by all students. In Level 1 all students used at least\n60\nAlT-J Volume 11 Number 3\ni of students In module In L 1. L2 & Li. who HMdeach available\n(Soiri-: resources aacavaltabte ro all\nII\nI i g. fe\nResource\nnLl:Mtad\nBody\n= L2: Ltjffic\n\u2022 L3:Katit\n3 =\u2022 =\nfigure \/: Use of resources\ntwo; in Level 2 all students used at least four and in Honours all students used at least five. In\nall levels lectures, tutorials, handouts and course-specific reading packs or text books, were\nused by more than 50 per cent of the class. In Level 1 and Honours, though not in Level 2,\nthe library was also used by more than 50 per cent of the class. The light use of the library by\nLevel 2 students may have resulted from the seemingly self-contained nature of the Logic\ncourse. There was a set text - Paul Tomassi's Logic (1999) - that all students taking the logic\ncomponent were advised to buy; electronic course materials and class assignments were made\navailable to the students in the lectures and on the Web. From this they may have concluded -\nnot unreasonably - that it was not a course that required supplementary reading.\nStudents intending to take Honours philosophy made a lot more use of class assignments,\nthe recommended text, and other relevant texts, but much less use of the Web-based course\nmaterials. However, of the 55 per cent of intending Honours students who did use the Web\nresources a large proportion (76 per cent) rated them highly. It might be that many of the\nstudents who were intending to take Honours in philosophy had a conception of\nphilosophy as a subject that does not include making use of Web-based materials, but if\nthey are being reviewed so favourably by such a high proportion of students perhaps we\nought to be encouraging the others to, at least, investigate them.\nThe less experienced students were more conservative in their choices of which resources to\nuse, preferring to stick with those things with which they were most familiar. But by the\ntime they reached Honours more than 50 per cent of the students were also making use of\nrevision tutorials, other texts, specimen and past examination papers as well as face-to-face\nand email discussions with their tutor. (Revision material was only available after the\n61\nSusan Stuart amd Margaret I. Brown An evaluation of learning resources for teaching formal philosophical methods\nquestionnaire had been completed by the Level 1 and 2 students, so we only have data from\nthose students who said that they intended to make use of them.) This is probably the\nresult of a number of factors, among them the fact that the student has a greater\nunderstanding of the system and what is available, but it also provides evidence of a\nmaturing relationship with the subject and with their method of dealing with it.\nDiscussions with tutors and lecturers is also much more popular in Honours; again there\nare clear reasons why this would be so. The tutorial groups are smaller in Honours and\nstudents can develop closer relationships with the department, their peers and their\nindividual tutors within the department. On top of this the students' confidence will have\ngrown. They will have successfully completed their first two pre-Honours years of study;\nthey will have satisfied the faculty and departmental entry requirements for Honours and\nwill have been selected to carry on at Honours level for two more years. This is a\nsubstantial achievement and students progressing to Honours will feel satisfied -justifiably\n- that they are getting to grips with the subject and its methods.\nWith all the learning resources available for students to use, it is surprising that there is still\na remarkable consistency among those that the students consider to be most valuable.\nWhat is not surprising is the fact that lectures and tutorials were ranked as the most useful\nresources by all students at all levels. The students enjoy having someone to communicate\nwith directly. They report that they like having someone in the room, someone to whom\nthey can relate and of whom they can ask questions in real time when the answer is of\nimmediate concern to them. But there are other reasons for attending the lectures. Some of\nthe mature students said that attendance at the lectures was crucial because trying to\nunderstand the subject by using the text alone could be an overwhelming experience. Other\nstudents added that the incremental nature of the logic course meant that missing any one\nlecture made it very hard to catch up. In both these cases part of the lecturer's role is as a\nguide and not just the conveyor of information. But, on a more mundane note, we might\ninterpret the fact that all the students who had completed a questionnaire and reported\nthat they had used the lectures, and that they had been 'extremely useful', were students\nwho had been at most, if not all, of the lectures and who were there on the day the\nquestionnaires were distributed. Indeed it would have been inconsistent if we had not\nreceived a 100 per cent figure for lecture use by these students and, at this stage in the\ncourse, the last formal lecture, it would have been unusual if the students in attendance had\nnot rated the lectures as useful or even extremely useful.\nThe 100 per cent use and usefulness rating of tutorials in Level 2 and Honours was a little\nmore interesting, especially in relation to the 93 per cent of Level 1 students who found\ntutorials useful, but it does not tell us anything that we did not already know, and that is,\nthat the more experienced students will have realized the benefit of airing and discussing\ntheir problems within a localized tutorial setting where there are fewer people and the\natmosphere to facilitate the exercising of ideas.\nLevel 2 Logic\nA comparative study of the Level 2 logic students' resource use and their subsequent\nexamination performance shows that there is a clear correspondence between lecture-\nproduced (lectures, tutorials, handouts, class assignments with answers on the Web and\n62\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 3\nhandsets) and those that the students who were successful claimed to have found very or\nextremely useful. This is not only reassuring but in striking contrast with the numerous\ncases where colleagues have lavished time on creating material that has met with only a\nlukewarm reception. In Level 2 logic, as in Level 1 'Philosophy of Mind and Honours\nKant', the resource most frequently quoted as increasing the students' interest in the\nsubject was lectures\/lecturer\/lecturing style. Students report being concerned about, and\ninfluenced by, the approachability and enthusiasm of the lecturer.\nIt also seems true to say that those students who do well seem to be much more confident\nwith the resources they are using. This may not necessarily be because better study skills\nand resource selection go with achieving higher marks, but because, in this particular\nsubject, students can more easily and accurately perceive how well they have understood\nthe material and students having trouble in getting to grips with the subject flail around in\nsearch of anything that seems even remotely helpful. Mature students reported that they\nread around and try things out, whereas the younger students are a lot more conservative\nand focus only on those things that have been recommended.\nL2: Logic: Number of Learning Resources used by Students\nwho gained 6-14 marks (lower 1\/3 of students) and\n18-20 marks (upper 1\/3 of students)\nI i SCO14 (n\u00ab13)\nNumber of Resources\nFigure 2: Number of resources used\nAll students made use of lectures, tutorials and paper handouts; a little over half the class\nmade use of the set text, and most of the students used the handsets in class. One very\nnoticeable difference was in the use of class assignments. Assignments with proofs to carry\nout and truth-tables to check were given out in class for the students to take home and\ncomplete. The answers were posted on the Web one week later, with more difficult\nproblems then discussed in the lectures. The students who achieved marks in the 15-20\n63\nSusan Stuart amd Margaret I. Brown An evaluation of learning resources for teaching formal philosophical methods\nrange, that is, more able students, reported that they had made good use of these\nassignments and had found them valuable. The weaker students made much less use of\nthem. Similarly a higher proportion of intending Honours students (65 per cent) used and\nvalued class assignments than those who were not planning to proceed to Honours (43 per\ncent).\nIt is evident that a smaller proportion of good students used a large number of resources.\nIndeed it is striking that almost 50 per cent of the students who scored from one to ten out\nof twenty used eleven or more resources, and of those who scored from eleven to twenty\nout of twenty only 10 per cent used so many. The average number of resources used by\nstudents in the low, middle and high scoring bands, is eight, seven, and six, respectively,\nwith low scoring students occasionally trying out up to fifteen different means of getting to\ngrips with the subject matter.\nAttendance at the last formative lecture - where the questionnaire was completed - was\nstrongly correlated with achieving high examination marks (see Table 2), although a few\nstudents did demonstrate that it was possible to get high exam marks without attending\nthat lecture. Those students who were not present at that lecture achieved marks of\nbetween one and nineteen out of twenty in the examination, whilst students who were\npresent achieved marks of between six and twenty out of twenty with five students\nachieving full twenty point scores.\n18 i\n16-\n14.\n12\n\u2022a\n\u2022 8 . 8 -\n6-\n4-\n2-\nL2: Logic: Marks gained by students who completed\/did not complete Q'n\n(were\/were not at lecture)\nJX\n1 2 3 4 5 (\n\" ri r i 1\n1\n1\nlire\n\u2022 students who did\nnot complete Q'naire\n\/were not at lecture\n(ii=44)\n> students who\ncompleted Q'naire \/\nwere at lecture\n(n=54)\n7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 IS 17 18 19 20\nLogic Q.

The handsets had not been\navailable in previous years, but instead had been incorporated into the class at the last\nminute when I was encouraged to use them by a colleague who was already successfully\nemploying them in a number of other disciplines (Draper, Cargill and Cutts, 2002). I\nthought that they would enable me to provoke an entire class into responding to my\nquestions rather than the usual few conscientious and vocal people who sit towards the\nfront, but I had worried that the students might think of them as a novelty and become\nquickly bored with their intrusive use in the class; my anxiety was unfounded.\nElectronic handsets are like TV remote control devices and every student is given one before\nthe lecture begins. Students are asked multiple-choice questions that they must think about\nbriefly and respond to fairly quickly, and each student transmits the number corresponding\nto their chosen answer. The answers are then collected on a laptop which displays, via the\nroom's projection system, a bar chart representing the distribution of the responses. One of\nthe essential features of the use of this equipment is that both the students and the lecturer\nget to know the distribution of responses and, in confidence, how their own response relates\nto that distribution. The element of anonymity - students pick out randomly numbered\nhandsets and numbers cannot be traced back to individual students - encourages everyone to\ncontribute and, unlike in face-to-face discussion, each individual can express the choice they\nincline to rather than the choice they would feel able to explain and justify to others. They\nprovide the student with the ideal circumstances under which they can try out their responses\nto questions without any fear of embarrassment if their answer turns out not to be right.\nThe sorts of questions that can be asked vary quite considerably, but typical examples had\nonly two possible answers, which were easier, and more importantly, quicker to ask. For\nexample, 'If the options for the next stage in this proof are MPP or MTT, which one would\nyou choose? Press 1 for MPP. Press 2 for MTT' I also asked more complex questions about\nhow well the class felt they were understanding material and, although the responses were\nsubjective, they were informative enough to provoke me to redirect my teaching.\nThe handset is a new and unfamiliar resource for the students, which changed the nature of\nthe lecture sessions. Student can be passive recipients in a traditional lecture; being pro-\nvided with knowledge from the tutor. Alternatively lectures can be made more interactive,\nby the lecturer attempting to engage the attention of the students by asking questions.\nHowever, usually only a few students speak, and so the state of understanding of the rest\nof the class remains opaque. Handsets facilitate, an interaction between students and\nlecturer that keeps the students thinking and concentrating on the material throughout the\nlecture. To encourage student-student interaction students were occasionally asked to\nanswer a question without thinking about it for too long; they were then asked to discuss it\nwith their neighbour and answer it again. There was a significant shift towards a greater\nnumber giving the right answer on the second attempt; it seems that the students who had a\nbetter grasp of the subject were able to convince their neighbour to change their mind\nresulting in consequential vote changes.\nTowards the end of the course we asked students when they were given a problem to work out in\na lecture, were they more likely to work out the answer based on a range of options (Figure 4).\n65\nSusan Stuart amd Margaret I. Brown An evaluation of learning resources for teaching formal philosophical methods\nQuestion More likely to work out the answer if: % of students\nnumber who voted\nfor each option\n1 the class was asked for a verbal response 0\n2 the class was asked to vote on one or more answers by putting their hand up 2\n3 the class was asked to vote on one or more answers using the handsets 33\n4 none of the above (i.e. I never try to work out an answer) 6\n5 all of the above (i.e. I always try to work an answer out) 28\n6 I and 2 (i.e. verbal and hands up but not handsets) 2\n7 I and 3 (i.e. verbal and handsets, but not hands up) 4\n8 2 and 3 (i.e. hands up and handsets, but not verbal) 26\nFigure 4: Preferred method of answering questions in a lecture\nOne way of interpreting these results is that the students enjoyed the interactive nature of\nthe lectures. In this instance their responses have provided us with an endorsement of the\nuse of handsets to engage students and hold their attention.\nThere are at least two very important things that emerge from the use of this new resource.\nThe first is that if the students are to answer the questions in ways that will be beneficial to\nthem, that is, if they are not just to guess, then they have to reflect more on what they have\nlearnt and how they are learning. A number of students reported that this was indeed the\ncase, but also that when they could see how well they were doing they felt much more\nconfident about what, up to then, they had only thought they knew. The conclusion here\nmust be that this is a valuable way to carry out formative assessment. The second is that my\nteaching was being directed more by what the students needed, or at least, what they said\nthey needed, rather than what I might have thought they needed; thus, I am less likely to\ntry to second-guess or make unwarranted assumptions about their progress. The most\nstriking instance of this was when I asked a question about how difficult students were\nfinding the rules we had covered to date; to my astonishment many of the students found\nDisjunctive Syllogism (DS) much more difficult to comprehend than V-Elimination (VE).\nIt seems such an unusual reversal in my own perception of the difficulty of the two rules\nthat I can only imagine that disjunctive syllogism somehow appeared just deceptively\nsimple and they were reluctant to believe that it could be so easy.\nProgression to Honours\nIn our attempt to establish the reasons why students pursued their study of philosophy\nbeyond their second year we discovered that students claim that philosophy is fun and that\nthey enjoy the challenge that it offers. However, they also admit that Honours philosophy\ncan be their only option when they fail to get in to their other Honours subject. So in some\ncases the element of choice is very nearly illusory. In fact, only 47 per cent of the students\nsaid that they had intended to do Honours philosophy before they came to university or in\ntheir first two years; for the rest - except for those who get better marks in it than their\nother subject, but who claim not to know how - Honours philosophy was little more than a\nfait accompli. Students also claimed that progression to Honours is often influenced by\nindividual members of staff and, even, by how well the department is perceived to run.\n66\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 3\nStudents give many reasons for not proceeding to Honours-level study in philosophy. They\nclaim to find it more difficult than they had expected and, because of the difficulty, they\nfind it dull and impractical. They say that they do not enjoy logic, they feel the emphasis on\nlogic is too great, and they fear that there will be much more logic in Honours. Some of the\nstudents claimed to prefer subjects which had a clear knowledge base; subjects in which\nthey could be given facts, learn them, and reproduce them - indicating a worrisome desire\nnot to think. However, a comment that really does hit home is that students see philosophy\nas a 'filler' subject, and not one from which there is a clear route to a 'proper' career.\nOne of the most interesting discoveries we made was that in Level 1 43 per cent of the\nstudents reported that they were intending to read philosophy at Honours. In Level 2 and\nHonours the figure was 47 per cent who reported that they had known before entering\nuniversity, or had decided during their first two years, that they wanted to read philosophy\nat Honours. The most surprising thing about these figures is how little fluctuation there is\nover the three years. It also indicates - as mentioned above - that for, at least, some\nproportion of the 53.4 per cent currently in Honours philosophy, philosophy is not their\nfirst choice. We need to put much more effort into developing and enhancing the important\nresources in our Level 1 and 2 classes, so that for many more students Honours philosophy\nwill be their first choice.\nConclusion\nWe have judged the effectiveness of a resource in two ways, by whether students have used\na resource and whether they have perceived it to be useful and, in the case of the Level 2\nLogic class, by the results the students achieved in the examination. We must bear in mind\nthat the first of these judgements is subjective, based on each individual student's\nassessment; however, we have seen that there is a remarkable consistency in what they say\nthey benefit from. The second might be considered to be more seriously problematic\nbecause there may be students who use all of the 'right' resources but who do not\nnecessarily employ good examination strategies. Unfortunately, there seems to be little way\nof telling when this might have happened in any individual case.\nAn investigation into teaching methods and resources of this sort is also beneficial for the\nlecturer. I regret that it has taken this study to drive home to me the great value of an\naccessible example in explaining something that might be obscure or difficult for the\nstudents. I was also surprised by having to return to explain a rule that I had assumed was\nstraightforward, but thankfully I had a mechanism in place that made it possible for the\nstudents to tell me that something was going wrong. I have also had the opportunity to see\nwhether the resources that I developed were useful for the students and, it has turned out,\nto my delight, that they are.\nThere are a couple of ways in which this study has been very good for the students. The\nfirst is that all of the students involved are now aware of the wealth of learning resources\nthat are available to them. The second is that it has shown that handsets can be used both\nto engage students and to monitor class understanding.\nAcknowledgements\nThis project was supported with funding from the Philosophical and Religious Studies\n67\nSusan Stuart amd Margaret I.
