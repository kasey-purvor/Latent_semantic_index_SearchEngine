INTRODUCTION\nPrivate international law deals with problems that arise when transactions or claims\ninvolve a foreign element. Such problems are most frequent in a setting that allows for\nthe growth of international relationships, be they commercial or personal. Economic\nintegration provides such a setting and allows for the free movement of persons, goods,\nservices and capital across national boundaries. The facilitation of factor mobility\nresulting from economic integration and the concomitant growth in international rela-\ntionships results in problems which call for resolution using the tools of private inter-\nnational law. An economic community cannot function solely on the basis of economic\nrules; attention must also be paid to the rules for settling cross-border disputes.\nConsequently, considerable attention is given to the subject within the European Union\n(EU)1 and other economic communities.2\nAfrica is currently pursuing economic integration through the African Economic\nCommunity (AEC). Palpably missing from the discourse on economic integration is\nany discussion of the role of private international law in this pursuit. The various instru-\nments for the pursuit of integration are also silent on this, which is troubling. So under-\ndeveloped is the subject in Africa that one writer has described it as \u0091the Cinderella\nsubject seldom studied [and] little understood.\u00923 This underdevelopment, coupled with\n1 Right from the European Community\u0092s inception, a sound private international law regime\nwas identified as having a key role to play in the creation and sustenance of the internal market.\nThus Article 220 (now Article 293 EC) of the Treaty of Rome charged Member States to enter\ninto negotiations with each other with a view to securing for the benefit of their nationals, \u0091the\nsimplification of formalities governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments\nof courts or tribunals and arbitration awards.\u0092 As was subsequently noted, \u0091a true internal market\nbetween the six States will be achieved only if adequate legal protection can be secured. The\neconomic life of the Community may be subject to disturbance and difficulties unless it is possi-\nble\u0085to ensure the recognition and enforcement of the various rights arising from the existence of\na multiplicity of legal relationships.\u0092 See Note sent to Member States on 22 October 1959, quoted\nin Council Report by Mr Jenard on the Convention of 27 September 1968 on Jurisdiction and\nEnforcement of Judgment in Civil and Commercial Matters OJ 1968 C59\/1. The Convention (now\nRegulation) on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters\n(Brussels I Regulation) was the direct product of this article.\n2 See eg work in the Organisation of American States (OAS) and the Common Market of the\nSouthern Cone (MERCOSUR) cited in Part II below.\n3 cf Forsyth Private International Law (Juta Cape Town 2003) 43. Other African textbooks\non the subject include: Christian Schulze On Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement\nof Foreign Money Judgments (UNISA Press 2005); J Kiggundu Private International Law in\nBotswana, Cases and Materials (Bay Publishing Gabarone 2002); John Ademola Yakubu\nHarmonisation of Laws in Africa (Malthouse Press Ltd Lagos 1999); IO Agbede Themes on\nConflict of Laws (Shaneson Ltd Lagos 1989); RA Sedler The Conflict of Laws in Ethiopia\n(Faculty of Law Haile Sellaise I University Addis Ababa 1965).\n[ICLQ vol 55, October 2006 pp 911\u0096928] doi: 10.1093\/iclq\/lei134\nthe diversity of approach to questions on the subject, has been identified as one of the\nkey obstacles to integration in Africa.4\nA well-developed and harmonized private international law regime is an indispens-\nable element in any economic community. Private international law has an impact on\nthe free movement of persons, goods, services and capital and consequently affects the\nfunctioning, and should therefore elicit the attention, of any economic community that\nenvisages factor mobility. Thus, for example, within the European Community, the\nharmonization of the rules of private international law is seen as having a part to play\nin creating the internal market. Harmonization helps promote equal treatment and\nprotection for citizens of the European Union, as well as other economic actors trans-\nacting or litigating in the internal market by subjecting them to a uniform and certain\nlegal regime. Harmonization also boosts certainty in the law, thus reducing transaction\nand litigation costs for economic actors within the Community. All these factors influ-\nence and underlie many of the Regulations adopted by the European Community.5\nWith the significance of the subject for the promotion of international commerce\nand hence for development,6 the underdeveloped and neglected state of Africa\u0092s\nprivate international law regime represents a loss of benefits, monetary and otherwise,\nthat can result from the use of the legal infrastructure of Africa. It makes businessper-\nsons lose confidence in the existing legal infrastructure of Africa. It also prevents the\ndevelopment of a consistent body of jurisprudence on the subject through academic\nresearch writing and judicial decision\u0097two basic sources of private international law\nnorms. All these call for greater attention to be given to the subject.\nII. THE AFRICAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY AND PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW\nA. The State of Affairs\nThe drive towards continent-wide economic integration in Africa began in 1963 with\nthe formation of the Organisation of African Union (OAU) [now the African Union\n(AU)]. The OAU was essentially a political body but in 1991 it entered the realm of\neconomic integration with the signing of the Treaty establishing the African Economic\n912 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n4 Bankole Thompson \u0091Legal Problems of Economic Integration in the West African Sub-\nRegion\u0092 (1990) 2 African J of Intl and Comparative L 85, 99\u0096100; Bankole Thompson and\nRichard S Mukisa \u0091Legal Integration as a Key Component of African Economic Integration: A\nStudy of Potential Obstacles to the Implementation of the Abuja Treaty\u0092 (1994) 20\nCommonwealth Law Bulletin 1446, 1454; Yinka Omorogbe \u0091The Legal Framework for Economic\nIntegration in the ECOWAS: An Analysis of the Trade Liberalisation Scheme\u0092 (1993) 5 African\nJ of Intl and Comparative L 355, 364; Muna Ndulo \u0091The Promotion of Intra-African Trade and\nthe Harmonisation of Laws in the African Economic Community: Prospects and Problems\u0092 in MA\nAjomo and Omobolaji Adewale (eds) African Economic Community Treaty, Issues Problems and\nProspects (Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies Lagos 1993) 107, 111\u009612.\n5 See eg the Convention (and now proposed Regulation) on the Law Applicable to\nContractual Obligations (OJ 1998 C 027)(Rome Convention) which is concerned with creating the\nright conditions for an internal market with the free movement of persons, goods, services and\ncapital within the Community; the Brussels Regulation on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of\nJudgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (EC Regulation No 44\/2001) (Brussels I Regulation)\naims at securing the free circulation of judgments within the Community to ensure that \u0091the\neconomic life of the Community is not disturbed and trade is thereby encouraged\u0092; Cheshire and\nNorth Private International Law (Butterworths London 1999) 481.\n6 IFG Baxter \u0091International Conflict of Laws and International Business\u0092 (1985) 34 ICLQ\n538; J Darby \u0091The Conflict of Laws and International Trade\u0092 (1967) 4 San Diego L Rev 45.\nCommunity (AEC Treaty).7 It envisages an economic union covering the whole of\nAfrica using the various regional economic communities as building blocks. It aims at\nthe gradual removal among its Member States of all obstacles to the free movement of\npersons, goods, capital and services. One of its cardinal objectives is the integration of\nthe economies of its members. The establishment of a \u0091common market\u0092 is seen as a\nmeans of ensuring the achievement of this objective. With the birth in 2002 of the AU\nas the successor to the OAU, the drive towards economic integration has gathered even\nmore force. The Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) brought to the fore the\nurgency with which Africa should pursue its integration efforts when it noted:\nIt is reasonable to assume that the most significant trend in this millennium is global\ncompetitiveness . . . nations are moving to integrate their economies with those of their\nneighbours . . . This shift is nowhere more urgent than in Africa, where the combined\nimpact of our relatively small economies, international terms of trade and the legacy of\ncolonialism, mis-rule and conflicts has meant that we have not yet assumed our global\nmarket share despite our significant market size.8\nEconomic integration and development are two cardinal objectives of the AU. The\nefforts at integrating the economies of Africa are inspired by the economic philosophy\nthat international commerce facilitates development. It is envisaged that uniting the\neconomies of Africa would permit the economies of scale; make them more competi-\ntive; provide access to a wider trading and investment environment; promote export to\nregional markets; and provide the requisite experience to enter global markets.\nIntegration will also provide a framework for African countries to cooperate in devel-\noping common services for finance, transport and communication.9\nConspicuously missing in all these efforts is an emphasis on the role of law and for\nthat matter private international law in facilitating and sustaining the economic inte-\ngration efforts. Apart from a quick reference to a dispute settlement mechanism one\ndoes not find much about law10 and even less so private international law in the AEC\nTreaty or subsequent instruments, which aim at promoting economic integration. This\ncontrasts sharply with the experiences of other economic communities. A case in point\nis the Organisation of American States, which has economic integration among its\nobjectives. The Organisation, through its Inter-American Conference on Private\nInternational Law, has supervised the negotiation and adoption of over 20 conventions\non the subject by its members.11 These conventions cover various aspects of the\nPrivate International Law and the African Economic Community 913\n7 Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community: reprinted in (1991) 3 African J Intl\nComparative L 792, and (1991) 30 Intl Legal Materials 1241; see generally MA Ajomo and\nOmobolaji Adewale (eds) African Economic Community Treaty, Issues Problems and Prospects\n(Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies Lagos 1993). The AEC Treaty entered into force\nin 1994.\n8 Forward to: Assessing Regional Integration in Africa, ECA Policy Research Report July\n2004.\n9 ECA Annual Report on Integration in Africa (2002) 2.\n10 In the 65-paged Treaty the word \u0091law\u0092 appears thrice; in the preamble, Article 18(2), and\n35(1) a. Assigning a minimal role for law has been noted as a characteristic of Africa\u0092s integra-\ntion effort and has been criticized.

It is truly ironic that none of the more than\n14 regional economic communities in Africa has private international law on its\nagenda.16 Indeed, ignoring bilateral agreements for the recognition and enforcement of\njudgments, no international convention negotiated between African states exists on the\nsubject. It is suggested that true integration should not aim only at the removal of barri-\ners to the movement of persons, goods, services and capital, but also the removal of\nlegal barriers; an underdeveloped or neglected private international law regime is one\nsuch legal barrier.\nWhile the development of a comprehensive private international law regime has\nstagnated in Africa, the volume, structure and techniques of commercial dealings have\nadvanced worldwide to the extent that Africa\u0092s regime may not be able to meet the\nneeds of the emerging commercial techniques. One such notable trend is the growth in\nelectronic commerce.17 It is increasingly being advocated that the rules of private inter-\nnational law have to be modified to meet these new challenges from international\ncommerce.18 Other challenges include the Internet, intellectual property protection,\nand trans-boundary environmental issues.

The author is however not aware of any initiative taken under\nthis article of significance for private international law.\n17 See, SO Manteaw \u0091Entering the Digital Market Place-Commerce and Jurisdiction in Ghana\u0092\n(2003) 16 Transnational Lawyer 345.\n18 Baxter (n 6).\nAfrica will lead to increased cross-boundary business activities between private parties.\nThe presence of a strong legal framework to facilitate this envisaged growth in\ncommercial activity should be paramount and a sound private international law regime\nis no mean part of that framework.\nFor example, a well-thought-out foreign judgment enforcement regime is indis-\npensable to the success of the economic community. If the enforcement of private legal\nclaims is unduly complicated, time-consuming and expensive, it would prove to be an\nobstacle to closer economic relations and hamper the development of a stable economic\nunion.19 The same thing can be said for jurisdiction and choice-of-law rules. Complex\nand diverse private international law rules engender uncertainty, increase transaction\ncosts and may drive away investors. For economic actors, certainty, predictability,\nsecurity of transactions, effective remedies and cost are paramount considerations in\ninvestment decision-making.20 In an era of high competition for investors, Africa, with\nits already small share of international trade and investment flow, cannot afford to\nscore low marks on these considerations.\nB. Differences in Approaches to the Subject in Africa\nIn Africa there exists a diversity of approaches to the various aspects of private inter-\nnational law. This is a reflection of the different legal traditions on the continent. The\nfollowing legal traditions can be identified: common law, civil law, Roman-Dutch law,\nIslamic law and customary law.\nOne area that is illustrative of this diversity is the rules regulating the enforcement\nand recognition of foreign judgments.21 Different approaches exist as regards the rules\nrelating to international jurisdictions as the basis of the competence of foreign courts,\nthe powers of the enforcing countries including the power of its courts to go into the\nmerits of the case on which the foreign judgment was founded, the type of foreign judg-\nments that can be enforced and the grounds for non-recognition of foreign judgments.\nThe section below provides an account of the law in five African countries.22 The\naccount is brief and is mainly intended to expose the diversity of approaches and the\nchallenges this poses for international economic relations in Africa.\nPrivate International Law and the African Economic Community 915\n19 P Hay \u0091The Common Market Preliminary Draft Convention on the Recognition and\nEnforcement of Judgments\u0097Some Considerations of Policy and Interpretation\u0092 (1968) 16 AJCL\n149; PMC Koh \u0091Foreign Judgments in ASEAN\u0097A Proposal\u0092 (1996) 45 ICLQ 844; Robert C\nCasad \u0091Civil Judgment Recognition and the Integration of Multi-state Associations: A\nComparative Study\u0092 (1980-1981) 4 Hasting Intl & Comp L Rev 1 where he identifies \u0091an effec-\ntive scheme for the mutual recognition and enforcement of civil judgments\u0092 as one feature of any\neconomic integration initiative \u0091likely to achieve significant integration\u0092.\n20 BA Caffrey International Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign\nJudgments in the LAWASIA Region: A Comparative Survey of the Laws of Eleven Asian Countries\nInter-se and with the EEC Countries (CCH Australia Ltd North Ryde 1985) 6 where he notes\n\u0091predictability, security of transaction and the prompt efficient and certain enforcement of claims\u0092\nas factors that future prominently in investment decision-making.\n21 S Thanawalla \u0091Foreign Inter Partes Judgments: Their Recognition and Enforcement in the\nPrivate International Law of East Africa\u0092 (1970) 19 ICLQ 430. Forsyth (n 3) 332 et al.\n22 The section is limited to the recognition and enforcement of only money judgments. The\ncommon law countries enforce only money judgments, but see section 3(1)(b) of the Foreign\nJudgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act (Cap 43) of Kenya allows for the registration of an\norder or judgment from a designated court in civil proceedings under which moveable property is\nordered to be delivered to any person.\n1. South Africa\nSouth Africa is a Roman-Dutch law country. In South Africa23 the recognition and\nenforcement of foreign judgments is governed by common law and statutory rules.24\nAt common law a foreign judgment creditor is not allowed to enforce the judgment\ndirectly. A fresh action must be brought for the foreign judgment to be made an order\nof a local court. This necessarily entails both financial and time costs. For a foreign\njudgment to be enforced under South African law, first it must have been rendered by\na court with international competence under the private international law rules of South\nAfrica. Two grounds of such international competence are residence and submission.\nAlthough easily stated the terms \u0091residence\u0092 and \u0091submission\u0092 defy definition.25 There\nis continuing debate as to whether other grounds such as nationality, domicile, and\nattachment of property should suffice for international competence.26 Secondly, the\njudgment must be final and conclusive. Thirdly, it should not be contrary to the\nProtection of Business Act 99 of 1978.27 There exist grounds under which the foreign\njudgment will not be recognized. These include its being contrary to public policy,\ninfringement of the rules of natural justice and procurement by fraud. These grounds\noften give rise to interpretive difficulties and leave a lot of room for judicial discretion.\nThe uncertainty that comes with it can be a disincentive to business.\nAnother means of enforcing civil judgments is through the Enforcement of Civil\nJudgments Act 32 of 1988. This Act was intended to provide an expedited means of\nenforcing foreign judgments emanating from designated countries. Significantly,\nunlike other statutory schemes in Africa, reciprocal treatment from the designated\ncountry is not required. The Act provides procedures for the foreign judgment to be\nregistered. Once registered it is treated as a judgment emanating from the magistrates\u0092\ncourt. A person may challenge the registration of the judgment on grounds similar to\nthat pertaining under the common law including fraud, breach of natural justice, satis-\nfaction, prescription or lapse, absence of jurisdiction on the part of the foreign court\nand contravention of South African public policy. However, because the Act applies\nonly to enforcement proceedings in the magistrates\u0092 courts where the financial limits\non actions is 100,000 Rand, it may not prove very useful in international commercial\ndispute judgments where the stakes may be extremely high. Consequently the scheme\nthat was intended to ensure an expedited and simplified way of enforcing foreign judg-\nments may be very much inaccessible to foreign litigants and their judgments may have\nto be enforced under the common law rules in the High Court with all its challenges.\n916 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n23 The law on this area is currently under review with a view to reform. See South African Law\nReform Commission, Consolidated Legislation Relating to International Cooperation in Civil\nMatters, Project 121 Discussion Paper 106 <http:\/\/www.law.wits.ac.za\/salc\/issue\/ip21.pdf>\n24 The Enforcement of Civil Judgments Act 32 of 1988, Protection of Business Act 99 of 1978.\n25 PSG Leon \u0091Roma non Locuta est.: the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments\nin South Africa\u0092 (1983) 26 Comparative and Intl L J of Southern Africa [CILSA] 325; See the\nUgandan case of Transroad Ltd v Bank of Uganda [1998] UGAJ No 12 Civil Appeal No 3 of 1997\non the difficulty of defining submission.\n26 ibid 338\u00969.\n27 Under section 1 of this Act certain types of judgment eg those related to mining, can not be\nenforce in South African except with the consent of the Minister for Economic Affairs. For a\ndiscussion and critique of this Act see Forsyth (n 3) 435\u00967.\n2. Angola and Mozambique28\nAngola and Mozambique are two civil law countries in Southern Africa. Their law on\nthis subject is contained in their respective Civil Procedure Codes, which are founded\non the Portuguese Civil Code of 1966. For a foreign judgment to be recognized, certain\nconditions must be met. First, the judgment must be an authentic document. The court\nof the forum must be satisfied that the judgment is genuine. This is a matter of proof\nand is unlikely to give rise to much difficulty. Secondly, the judgment must be final in\nthe foreign country and the matter should not have been pending before any court in\nthe forum except where the foreign court was first seised. This requirement envisages\na situation of multiple litigation on the same subject matter in different fora. Thirdly,\nthe defendant must have had notice of the foreign proceedings and in the case of a\ndefault judgment the original notification initiating the proceedings must have been\nhanded to him in person. This requirement is similar to the requirements of natural\njustice and due process in common law countries. Fourthly, in those cases where the\nrules of private international law of the forum provide that the substantive law of the\nforum should have been applied, the decision reached by the foreign court affecting a\ncitizen of the forum may not disadvantage that citizen-defendant in relation to the deci-\nsion that would have been reached had the law of the forum been applied. In other\nwords, a national of the forum should not be treated less favourably than he\/she would\nhave been treated in his\/her national court. Finally, the foreign court must have had\ninternational jurisdiction in accordance with the private international law rules of the\nforum.\nInternational jurisdiction of the foreign court will, however, be recognized only\nwhen the court of the forum did not claim jurisdiction of its own over the subject-\nmatter. They will claim jurisdiction if: (a) the defendant had been resident for a mini-\nmum of six months or if their national is a party to the litigation; (b) the act giving rise\nto the litigation was carried out on the territory of the forum or carried out by a national\nof the forum provided that the country of nationality of the victim would also have\nclaimed jurisdiction if the act had been committed by its national against a national of\nthe forum; (c) it is found that the forum would have been the most convenient forum\nfor the trial of the action and actual links between the subject-matter and the forum\nexist.\nA judgment founded on a foreign jurisdiction agreement will not be recognized if\nthe aim of that agreement was to exclude the jurisdiction of the forum, whenever such\njurisdiction would have existed under the Code, or one of the parties is a national of the\nforum or the matter concerns assets situated in the forum. Such jurisdiction agreements\nare treated as void. This hostility to jurisdiction agreements is akin to Latin American\ncountries\u0092 historical disdain for similar clauses founded on their rejection of the prin-\nciple of party autonomy\u0097a principle so important in international commerce.29 This\ntreatment of jurisdiction agreements can be a disincentive to international commercial\nrelations since they are very much part of the current modes of dealing across national\nboundaries.\nPrivate International Law and the African Economic Community 917\n28 This part relies heavily on the work of Andre Thomashausen of the Institute of Comparative\nLaw South Africa. See A Thomashausen \u0091The Enforcement and Recognition of Foreign\nJudgments and other forms of Legal Cooperation in the SADC\u0092 (2002) 35 CILSA 26.\n29 Juenger (n 11) 386\u00968.\nApart from the interpretive difficulties associated with these provisions, one cannot\nlose sight of their nationalistic fervour and attempt to protect nationals of the forum. In\nan international commercial setting this may be an obstacle to attracting commercial\ndealings with one\u0092s nationals.\n3. Tanzania30\nTanzania is a common law country in East Africa. The recognition and enforcement\nof foreign judgments in Tanzania is governed by the common law rules and a statu-\ntory regime for the registration of judgments from specified countries. Although little\nwill be said of the common law rules, 31 it is worthy of note that the common law rule\nthat a cause of action survives the foreign judgment such that fresh action could be\nbrought by either party if dissatisfied with the judgment,32 may not apply in Tanzania.\nThis is because under section 11 of the Civil Procedure Code 1966, \u0091a foreign judg-\nment shall be conclusive as to any matter thereby directly adjudicated upon between\nthat same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim . . .\u009233 This\npresumption makes it easier for an application for summary judgment to be founded\non it since the judgment is less susceptible to challenge and shifts the burden of proof,\nwith the cost it entails, onto the defendant.34 In jurisdictions where this conclusive\nrule does not exist, a party may have to rely on the common law rules of estoppel and\nprovide proof to that effect. This entails additional litigation cost and time for the\njudgment creditor.\nThe statutory regime is governed by the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign\nJudgments Act of 1935,35 together with two subsidiary pieces of legislation, namely,\nthe Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Order36 and the Reciprocal\nEnforcement of Foreign Judgment Rules.37 Under the Act, \u0091judgment\u0092 means a judg-\nment or order given or made by a court in any civil proceedings, or a judgment or order\ngiven or made by a court in any criminal proceedings for the payment of a sum of\nmoney in respect of compensation or damages to an injured party.\nThe Act applies to judgments given in named foreign countries on the basis of reci-\nprocity. The President designates these countries after he is satisfied that judgments of\nthe Tanzanian courts will be accorded similar treatment in that country.38 Thus, like\nother statutory enforcement schemes in Africa, the doctrine of reciprocity lies at its\n918 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n30 I am indebted to Mrs Eleanor Ngalo for providing me with materials relating to the law in\nTanzania.\n31 I concentrate in this part only on the statutory regime since the common law position is simi-\nlar to that of other common law countries like Ghana discussed below.\n32 This rule has been abolished in England by s 34 of Civil Jurisdiction and Judgment Act\n1982.\n33 Discussed in Thanawalla (n 21) 430.\n34 This presumption is, however, rebuttable by proof of want of jurisdiction, fraud, breach of\nnatural justice, a law in force in Tanzania or international law and the fact that the judgment was\nnot given on the merits. See ss 11 and 12 of the Civil Procedure Code 1966.\n35 Ch 8 of the Revised Laws of Tanzania.\n36 GN Nos 8 and 9 of 1936.\n37 GN No 15 of 1936.\n38 The Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Order list named courts in the following\ncountries in its schedule Lesotho, Botswana, Mauritius, New South Wales, Zambia, Seychelles,\nSomalia, Zimbabwe, Kingdom of Swaziland, and the United Kingdom.\nheart. Consequently, it may inure to the benefit of judgment creditors from only some\nfew countries. Section 3(2) of the Act provides that any judgment of a superior court\nof a foreign country to which this part extends, shall apply if: (a) it is final and conclu-\nsive between the parties thereto and (b) there is payable thereunder a sum of money not\nbeing a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect\nof a fine or other penalty. Under the section, a judgment shall be taken to be final even\nif there is a pending appeal.\nSection 4(1) of the Act provides that a judgment creditor of a judgment to which the\nAct applies may apply to the High Court for registration of the judgment at any time\nwithin six years after the date of the judgment, or in case of an appeal within six years\nafter the date of the last judgment given in those proceedings. An application for regis-\ntration can be made ex parte and shall be supported by an affidavit of facts.39 A judg-\nment shall not be registered if it has been wholly satisfied40 or if it could not be\nenforced by execution in the country of the original court.41 Upon registration, the\njudgment shall for the purposes of execution be of the same force and effect as if the\njudgment had been a judgment originally given in the registering court and entered on\nthe date of registration.\nThe Act provides grounds under which an application could be made to set aside\nthe registration. An application to set aside the registration of a judgment shall be made\nto a judge in chambers by summons supported by an affidavit.42 Section 6(1) of the Act\nprovides that the registration of the judgment shall be set aside if the registering court\nis satisfied that43 (i) the judgment is not a judgment to which this part applies; (ii)\ncourts of the country of the original court had no jurisdiction in the circumstances of\nthe case; (iii) the judgment debtor being the defendant in the proceedings in the origi-\nnal court did not receive notice of those proceedings and did not appear; (iv) judgment\nwas obtained by fraud; (v) enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to the public\npolicy in the country of the registering court; and (vi) rights under the judgment are not\nvested in the person by whom the application for registration was made. The registra-\ntion may also be set aside if the court is satisfied that the matter in dispute in the\nproceedings in the original court had, prior to the date of judgment in the original court,\nbeen the subject of a final and conclusive judgment by a court having jurisdiction in\nthe matter.\n4. Ghana\nGhana is a common law country in West Africa. The recognition and enforcement of\nforeign judgments in Ghana is governed by common law and statutory rules. The\ndearth of case law44 and writing in this regard makes it difficult to ascertain or advise\non how far the Ghanaian courts will depart from the limitations of the common law as\nwas inherited from the United Kingdom.\nUnder common law in Ghana a foreign judgment creditor cannot directly enforce\nthe judgment in Ghana. He has to bring an action on the judgment. The common law\nPrivate International Law and the African Economic Community 919\n39 The Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgment Rules, GN No 15 of 1936, s 3(1).\n40 The Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgment Act, 1935, s 4(1) (a).\n41 ibid s 4 (1) (b).\n42 Reciprocal Rules (n 39) s 10(1).\n43 Enforcement Act (n 40) s 6(1) (a) (i-vi).\n44 Yankson v Mensah [1976] 1 GLR 355; Republic v Mallet, Ex Parte Braun [1975] 1 GLR 68.\ntreats such judgments as evidence of a debt. Consequently, only judgments for fixed\nsums of money are enforceable in Ghana. To be recognized and enforced the judgment\nhas to be final and conclusive and must have been given by a court which, as a matter\nof Ghanaian private international law, had jurisdiction. The fact that the judgment has\nto be final and conclusive raises difficult questions in the enforcement of default judg-\nments, which in most jurisdictions are capable of being set aside within a certain time.\nHowever, the fact of a pending appeal does not render a judgment inconclusive\nalthough the court in the exercise of its discretion may be slow to enforce such judg-\nment. A defendant to an action for recognition and enforcement can raise certain\ndefences. These include the absence of international competence on the part of the\nforeign court, breach of natural justice, fraud and inconsistency with Ghana\u0092s public\npolicy. A distinctive feature of this regime is that the court will not go into the merits\nor substance of the case and there is no requirement of reciprocity.\nThe procedure in Ghana is for the judgment creditor to issue a writ and to plead that\nthe judgment debt is due and owing. He can apply for summary judgment under Order\n14 of the High Court Civil Procedure Rules45 on the grounds that the defendant has no\nreal prospect of successfully defending the claim. The requirement of service, the time\nfor exchange of pleadings, and the actual trial mean a lot of time may be spent before\nthe judgment can be enforced, especially if one factors in the backlog of cases in the\ncourts.\nApart from the common law regime, there is a statutory scheme for the registration\nof judgments in Ghana. This scheme dates back to 190846 and is currently regulated by\nPart V of the Courts Act 1993 [Act 459]. It operates on the basis of reciprocity. Thus,\nif the President is satisfied that when the benefits of the scheme are extended to judg-\nments from a country similar benefits will be accorded Ghanaian judgments, he may\nby a legislative instrument designate that country as entitled to the benefits of the\nscheme.47 The President may also by legislative instrument decree that no proceedings\nshall be entertained in any court in Ghana for the recovery of any sum alleged to be\npayable under a judgment given in a court of a country which accords less favourable\ntreatment to judgments from Ghana.48 It is debatable whether this power is limited to\nonly previously designated countries. It appears from the language of the section that\nit is not so limited.\nThe statutory scheme applies to a judgment from the designated country if it is final\nand conclusive between the parties and there is payable under it a sum of money not\nbeing a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of similar nature or in respect\nof a fine or penalty. A judgment is final notwithstanding that an appeal is pending or\nthat a legal possibility exists for an appeal.49\nA judgment creditor of a judgment to which the scheme applies may apply, within\nsix years of the judgment and with proof of prescribed matters, to the High Court for\nregistration. A right of execution exists after registration. The judgment will, however,\nnot be registered if it has been wholly satisfied or it could not be enforced by execution\nin the country of the judgment.50 Additionally, where the sum payable under the judg-\nment, which is to be registered, is expressed in a foreign currency the judgment shall\n920 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n45 Constitutional Instrument 47 of 2004.\n46 Foreign Judgments Extension Ordinance 1907, No 4.\n47 Section 81(1) of Act 459. 48 Section 87 of Act 459.\n49 Section 81 of Act 459. 50 Section 82 of Act 459.\nbe registered as if it were a judgment for a sum in the currency of Ghana based on the\nrate of bank exchange prevailing at the date of the judgment of the original court.51 The\neffect of this conversion rule can be of great financial significance to both parties espe-\ncially in an era of fluctuating movements in exchange rates. It may work to the disad-\nvantage of one party. The rule appears to be an extension of the common law rule that\na court cannot give judgment in a foreign currency.52 This rule has been abandoned in\nEngland and modified in other jurisdictions in recognition of the hardship it can work\non parties.53 The existence of this rule is inconsistent with current thinking. In Ghana\nthe rule has no application in common law actions.54\nA person against whom a registered judgment may be enforced can apply for the\nregistration to be set aside. There exist mandatory and discretionary grounds for setting\naside the registration. The mandatory grounds are absence of jurisdiction, non-appear-\nance in the original proceedings due to the fact that he was not given sufficient time to\nprepare a defence, fraud and inconsistency with Ghana\u0092s public policy.55 Among the\nrecognized bases of jurisdiction are residence, submission and, in the case of busi-\nnesses, having a principal place of business, a place of business or an office in the\nforeign country. There are also discretionary grounds for setting aside registration.\nFirst, the registration may be set aside if the registering court is satisfied that the matter\nin dispute in the proceedings in the original court had, prior to the date of the judgment\nin the original court, been the subject of a final and conclusive judgment by a court that\nhad jurisdiction in the matter.56 This rule envisages a situation of two conflicting judg-\nments and gives the court discretion not to register the judgment presented to it.57\nSecondly, the fact that an appeal is pending or the applicant is entitled to appeal may\nbe a ground for setting aside the registration.\nThe above procedures for the recognition and enforcement of judgments in the\nselected countries58 reveal some level of diversity in approach to the subject. One\nshould, however, not exaggerate the extent of this diversity in Africa. African countries\nthrough their colonial experience can be divided into blocks with almost identical legal\nregimes. For example, the regime in the common law countries, like Ghana and\nTanzania above, through their association with the United Kingdom and the\nCommonwealth, has resulted in an almost identical approach to the subject.59 This\ntrend has been facilitated by the draftsman\u0092s penchant for copying legislation from\nsister countries.\nPrivate International Law and the African Economic Community 921\n51 Section 82(7) of Act 459.\n52 Manners v Pearson [1898] 1 Ch 581.\n53 Miliangos v George Frank (Textiles) Ltd [1976] AC 443.\n54 Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM) v Farmex Ltd [1989\u009690] 1 GLR 46; RE Bannermah \u0091Award of\nDamages in Foreign Currency: A critical look at the Judgments\u0092 [1993\u00965] 19 Rev of Ghana L 231.\n55 Section 81(1)(a) of Act 459. 56 Section 81(1)(b) of Act 459.\n57 For alternative solutions see M Wolff Private International Law (Clarendon Press Oxford\n1962) 263, Showlag v Mansour [1995] 1 AC 431 and s 34(4) of the Brussels I Regulation.\n58 For a discussion of the regimes in other African Countries see Schulze (n 3); Louis Garb and\nJulian Lew (eds) Enforcement of Foreign Judgments (Looseleaf) (Kluwer Law International\n2002); Philip R Weems (eds) Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Abroad (Looseleaf) (Mattew\nBender New York 1993).\n59 KW Patchett Recognition and Enforcement of Commercial Judgments and Awards in the\nCommonwealth, (Butterworths London 1984); HE Read Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign\nJudgments in the Common Law Units of the British Commonwealth (Harvard University Press\nCambridge 1938).\nFor the international businessperson one important consideration in all these\nschemes is the extent to which they provide a cheap, rapid and uncomplicated means\nof enforcing judgments. It is doubtful whether these schemes afford this. They do not\nprovide for automatic enforcement60 and the possibility for registration or enforcement\nto be refused on vague and nationalist grounds exists. Another worrying trend is the\nrole of the state, especially the executive, in these enforcement schemes.61 For exam-\nple, the doctrine of reciprocity elevates a purely private claim to one of public interest\nsuch that enforcement may be denied or at least the route to enforcement made more\ncomplicated depending on the treatment one\u0092s government accords to similar judg-\nments from the enforcing country; something the individual has no influence over.\nSome of the laws are also out of tune with the demands of modern international\ncommerce.62 An example is the Ghanaian rule which compels the conversion into cedis\nof the foreign judgment debt before registration. In a country where currency fluctua-\ntion is common this may work to the disadvantage of one party through no personal\nfault.63 Their consistency with international law can also be questioned. It can be\nargued that the Ghanaian provision which allows the President to conclusively declare\njudgments from certain countries unenforceable because they do not accord favourable\ntreatment to judgments from Ghana, violates international human rights law. A judg-\nment is property and international human rights law recognizes the individual\u0092s right\nto own property. Article 17(2) of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights is very\nemphatic in its terms: \u0091no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property\u0092. In so far as\nthis evidences general international law, Ghana cannot make an individual\u0092s enjoyment\nof this right contingent on a state of affairs (the giving of less favourable treatment to\njudgments from Ghana) he\/she has no hand in creating. To do so arguably amounts to\nan arbitrary deprivation of property and restricts the right of access to justice. All these\ncall for a second look to be taken at these schemes if we hope to promote international\ncommercial dealings on the continent.\nIt is not only in the area of recognition and enforcement of judgments that a diver-\nsity of rules exists. The same can be said of aspects of jurisdiction and choice of law.\nFor example, whilst common law countries found jurisdiction on presence and resi-\ndence and shun domicile and nationality as a basis of jurisdiction, that is not the case\nwith the civil law countries. In addition, certain doctrines of the common law on juris-\ndiction seem unavailable in some countries. For example, there is doubt as to the exis-\ntence of the doctrine of forum non-conveniens in the Roman-Dutch law of South\n922 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n60 Compare the approach adopted in the Brussels I Regulation, which provide for automatic\nenforcement with little procedural obstacles and narrowly defined grounds for non-recognition.\nCheshire and North (n 5) 481.\n61 An interesting contrast is the approach adopted in Ethiopia, Egypt and Tunisia, which\nentrusts the reciprocity assessment to the judiciary. See Art 457 of the Ethiopian Civil Procedure\nCode 1965, Art 296 of the Egyptian Civil and Commercial Procedure 1968 and Art 319 of the\nTunisian Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure. Also, S Teshale \u0091Reciprocity with respect to\nEnforcement of Foreign Judgments in Ethiopia: A critique of the Supreme Court\u0092s Decision in the\nPaulos Papassinous Case\u0092 (2000) 12 African J Intl Comparative L 569.\n62 U U Chukwumaeze \u0091 Enforcement of Foreign Judgment in Nigeria: A Clog on the Wheel of\nGlobalisation\u0092 2004 Nigerian Journal of Legal Studies 1.\n63 Compare the rule in Australia and New Zealand, where the judgment creditor is given the\noption to state in his application whether he wishes the judgment to be registered in the currency\nof the original judgment: section 6(11)(a) of the Foreign Judgment Act 1991 (Cth) of Australia, s\n4(3) of the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act, 1934 of New Zealand.\nAfrica.64 In the area of choice of law, the extent to which, for example, parties are free\nto choose the governing law of their contract varies not only among jurisdictions but\nalso the character of the transaction. For example, while it has been suggested that the\nposition of the concept of party autonomy in the Roman-Dutch law of South Africa is\n\u0091equivocal\u0092,65 there is also no definite solution on choice of law in torts.66 For common\nlaw countries, it remains to be seen how far they will be prepared to do away with the\nold common law rules on choice of law in torts abandoned in England and other\ncommon law jurisdictions.67 Consequently, a comprehensive and holistic look has to\nbe taken at the subject in any discussion for reform.\nIII. CALL FOR REFORM\nGiven the diversity of approaches to the subject, there is a need for African countries\nto embark on a comprehensive look at and reform of the regime of private international\nlaw before any talk of a common market can be meaningful. The goal of ensuring \u0091the\nfree movement of persons, goods, services and capital and right of establishment and\npersons\u009268 will not materialize without these reforms.69 The AEC Treaty envisages \u0091the\nestablishment of a common market\u0092 as one of the \u0091stages\u0092 in the attainment of the\nCommunity\u0092s objective.70 With the creation of a common market, together with the\nfree movement of persons, goods, services and capital, one can foresee not only\nincreased development of cross-national relationships, such as through marriages, but\nalso an increase in international commerce. This will mean a greater resort to private\ninternational law for the resolution of cross-border conflicts. There will also be the\nneed for harmonized private international law rules to govern the operation of diver-\ngent national substantive rules.71\nAlthough no specific time is set for the attainment of the common market, it can be\ninferred from the Treaty that it must happen within the next 40 years. I contend that the\ntime to begin preparation for it is now. Luckily, Africa has the benefit of other people\u0092s\nefforts to learn from. In the absence of a specific mention of the need to harmonize laws\nas one of the means of achieving the objectives of the Community, Article 77 of the\nAEC Treaty can be used as the basis for such an enterprise. A purposive construction\nof its provision leads to this conclusion. Under it Member States agreed \u0091to consult with\none another for the purpose of harmonizing their respective policies in other fields for\nPrivate International Law and the African Economic Community 923\n64 C Schulze \u0091Forum non-Conveniens in Comparative Private International Law\u0092 (2001) 118 S\nAfrican L J 812, 827\u0096828; Forsyth (n 3) 173\u0096176.\n65 Forsyth (n 3) 298.

Article 25(2) of the AEC Treaty, which allows the\nAssembly of Heads of State or Governments to establish additional specialized techni-\ncal committees can provide the basis for such legislation. Legislation will be more\nempowering than relying on treaty interpretation for jurisdiction or competence.73\nBefore this Community legislation is enacted, it is suggested that the Committee on\nCoordination established under the Protocol on the Relationship between the African\nEconomic Community and the Regional Economic Communities, which has as one of\nits principal responsibilities the coordination and harmonization of \u0091integration legisla-\ntion\u0092,74 should interpret this function broadly to cover not only \u0091legislation\u0092 but the\nimpact of existing legal regimes in Africa for the success of the Community. Among\nthe areas that should receive immediate attention are choice of law in contract, juris-\ndiction and the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments.\n924 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n72 AEC Treaty (n 7) Art 77.\n73 The wisdom of such a mandate is revealed by the speed with which a European private inter-\nnational law is emerging after the Community was specifically mandated by Article 65 of the\nTreaty of Amsterdam to legislate in the area of private international law. Article 65 provides that\nmeasures in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications, to\nbe taken in accordance with Article 67 and insofar as necessary for the proper functioning of the\ninternal market shall include: (a) improving and simplifying . . . the recognition and enforcement\nof decisions in civil and commercial cases, including decisions in extrajudicial cases, and, (b)\npromoting the compatibility of the rules applicable in Member States concerning conflict of laws\nand of jurisdiction. Article 65 must be read together with Article 61(c), 95 and 67.

The contrast between the approaches of the EU and the USA is worth\nnoting in this regard. The EU has adopted a universalist approach, which lays down\nuniform rules on jurisdiction, choice of law and the recognition and enforcement of\njudgments, albeit on defined subject matters, for its members. Thus the Brussels I\nRegulation focuses on \u0091civil and commercial matters\u0092 while the Rome Convention\napplies only to contracts. In the USA on the other hand the individual states subject to\nconstitutional constraints adopt a particularistic approach to questions of jurisdiction\nand choice of law with the recognition and enforcement of judgments regulated by the\nfull faith and credit clause of the Constitution. The lesson may be that we need to avoid\nconventions, which are too broad in the scope of their application at the international\nlevel. Such conventions are difficult to negotiate. We also have to recognize that an\neconomic community can perfectly well exist with members having a plurality of legal\nsystems if a sound private international law regime exists within the national systems.\nThe reform agenda should be approached from both a national and international\nperspective. The ultimate aim should be to ensure a well-thought-out private interna-\ntional law regime that will engender stability, security and predictability in interna-\ntional commercial transactions in Africa.\nAt the national level there is the urgent need to reduce private international law\nrules into writing.76 The lack of written rules is very much a feature of the common law\ncountries in this area of the law. Occasionally in these jurisdictions, private interna-\ntional law rules are placed in a general statute.77 In reducing the rules into writing a\ncareful balance must be struck between the desire for certainty and the quest for flexi-\nbility. Flexibility will facilitate adaptation to new challenges through a process of judi-\ncial decision-making. This is an approach not uncommon in the common law world.\nIndeed, the evolution of private international law in the common law world has largely\nbeen the work of judges and \u0091eccentric professors\u0092.78\nNational efforts should be complemented by continental efforts, spearheaded by the\nAfrican Union, at unification of private international law rules. There should be an\nacknowledgement that it is possible for nations of diverse culture and legal tradition to\nachieve harmonization of their laws either substantively or through private interna-\ntional law. The USA and the EU\u0092s approach to the harmonization of law in an inte-\ngrated economy respectively again attest to this. Each, however, comes with its own\nchallenges.\nIn the USA the harmonization of commercial law through the Uniform Commercial\nCode has been a great success. The EU has however not been very successful in this\nPrivate International Law and the African Economic Community 925\n75 Peter Hay et al \u0091Conflict of Laws as a Technique for Legal Integration\u0092 in M Cappelliti et al\n(eds) Integration through Law Europe and the American Experience Vol 1(2) (Walter de Gruyter\nBerlin New York 1989) 168.\n76 F von Schwind \u0091Problems of Codification of Private International Law\u0092 (1968) 17 ICLQ\n428.\n77 Section 32 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1971 and s 17 of the Wills Act 1971 of Ghana.\n78 WL Prosser \u0091Interstate Publication\u0092 (1952\u00963) 51 Michigan L Rev 959, 971, but see Peter\nNorth \u0091Private International Law: Change or Decay\u0092 (2001) 50 ICLQ 477 and Christopher Forsyth\n\u0091The Eclipse of the Private International Law Principle?

On the other hand the EU has been very successful with the\nBrussels I Regulation and the Rome Convention\u0097all dealing with aspects of private\ninternational law. Thus there is not only one course to follow. Whichever choice is\nmade should however be with a full appreciation of its limitations and be informed by\nour socio-economic and political circumstances.\nIn Africa one could sense some efforts in both directions. In this respect the work\nof the Organisation for the Harmonization of Commercial Law in Africa (OHADA)\nand the Institute of Private International Law in Southern Africa needs mention. The\nTreaty on the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa established OHADA. It\ncurrently has 16 members. They are Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central\nAfrican Republic, the Comoros, Congo-Brazzaville, Cote d\u0092Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea,\nGuinea Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Chad, and Togo.79\nConspicuously missing from this list are the Anglophone countries, although the Treaty\nis open to membership from all African countries. One of the central concepts of the\nTreaty is the promotion of African economic integration.80 The objective of the Treaty\nis \u0091the harmonization of business laws\u009281 in the Contracting States. Pursuant to this,\nvarious Acts, called Uniform Acts, have been enacted and adopted dealing with aspects\nof commercial law. These include Uniform Acts on general commercial law, commer-\ncial companies and economic interest groups, and secured transactions, bankruptcy,\ndebt collection procedures and accounting law.82\nThe approach adopted by OHADA aims at the unification of substantive law. This\ncan be contrasted with that which aims at the unification of private international law\nrules. The OHADA approach has advantages and disadvantages.83 Certainty comes\nwith the substantive unification of laws. People transacting across national boundaries\nwill be subject to the same substantive law. Indeed, to some, whenever feasible\nsubstantive unification may be preferred to the unification of private international law\nrules.84 These attempts at substantive unification are fraught with difficulty and have\nbeen described as representing the product of \u0091mighty effort by dedicated men to solve\ninevitable collision problems in international commercial intercourse\u009285 but they do not\nmark the end for the role of private international law in international commerce. As\nGoode admits, \u0091every substantive law harmonised reduces the scope of the conflict of\nlaws . . . It is clear however that since there are practical limits to what can be\nharmonised, private international law will remain of considerable importance in the\nresolution of cross border disputes for the foreseeable future.\u009286\n926 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n79 <http:\/\/www.ohadalegis.com\/anglais\/presohadagb.htm>.\n80 Preamble to the Treaty <http:\/\/www.ohadalegis.com\/anglais\/presohadagb.htm> on the\nHarmonisation of Business Law in Africa.\n81 Article 1 of the Treaty on the Harmonisation of Business Law in Africa.\n82 See B Martor et al Business Law in Africa, OHADA and the Harmonization Process (Kogan\nPage UK 2002); Claire Moore Dickerson \u0091Harmonising Business Laws in Africa: OHADA case\nCalls the Tune\u0092 (2005) 44 Columbia J Transnational L 17.\n83 Helen Elizabeth Hartnell \u0091The New New International Economic Order: Private\nInternational Law\u0092 (1993) 87 American Society Intl L Proceedings 462.\n84 Hay (n 75) 256.\n85 Derby (n 6) 67.\n86 R Goode \u0091Rule, Practice and Pragmatism in Transnational Commercial Law\u0092 (2005) ICLQ\n539, 541.\nSubstantive unification of private law does not eliminate the potential for private\ninternational law problems: \u0091the law of conflict of laws is not so easily banished from\nthe realm of foreign trade.\u009287 In the absence of an autonomous legal system to impose\nuniform interpretation, problems of diverse interpretation may bedevil uniform laws.88\nProblems of characterization will not go away. Thus, the unification of substantive law,\nwhenever that course is taken, should be matched by improvement in private interna-\ntional law rules.\nAn approach of unifying private international law, leaving the substantive laws\ndiverse has its merits.89 It will entail only a minimal disturbance in national legal\nsystems. Rules of private international law address themselves to only matters involv-\ning foreign elements. That is not so with substantive law. Thus, it is more likely to\nappeal to the politician with an eye on preserving his\/her country\u0092s unique or perceived\nsuperior legal system. Also the process could be much simpler. A whole branch of\nsubstantive law may be covered by a few choice-of-law clauses. And for the interna-\ntional businessman it will foster predictability by pointing him to a specific jurisdiction\nin case of dispute and the applicable law.\nThe establishment of a court empowered to provide authoritative and final inter-\npretation of the unified rules would enhance the success of this approach. Under the\nAEC Treaty the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the Community could be\nextended to encompass this role.90 This should be coupled with mutual trust and\nrespect of each other\u0092s national judicial competence.\nThe Institute for Private International Law in Southern Africa91 is also doing a lot\nin the area of harmonization, especially for the Southern African regime. It was estab-\nlished in 2000 and is part of the University in Johannesburg. Its goal is to draft a code\nof private international law of contract for the Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC) and\/or the AU. This is a laudable effort by academics to develop\nthe subject. The work of this Institute should be promoted by the AU and made a conti-\nnent-wide initiative.\nThe harmonization of private international law in Africa should be combined with\nincreased participation of Africa in international fora for the discussions of private inter-\nnational law issues. Currently, Africa\u0092s participation in these fora is at best minimal. For\nexample, only three African countries, Egypt, Morocco and South Africa, are members\nof the Hague Conference on Private International Law.92 In this era of globalization, we\nPrivate International Law and the African Economic Community 927\n87 Derby (n 6) 70.\n88 ibid 71. With respect to OHADA it is envisaged that the existence of the Common Court of\nJustice and Arbitration will fulfil this role of ensuring uniformity in interpretation.

It is only through participation that\nwe can learn, be heard and make the emerging international conventions on the subject\ntake account of our special needs and interests. It is recommended that AEC, besides\nencouraging its members to join, should follow suit and let its voice be heard on the\ninternational scene as regards matters of private international law.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThis paper exposes the neglect of private international law in Africa in the discourse\non and steps towards economic integration. It has provided an account of the state of\nprivate international law in Africa. The neglect of the subject in Africa poses a chal-\nlenge for the facilitation and sustenance of the gains of economic integration. There is\nneed for greater attention, with a view to reforms, to be given to the subject to meet the\nchallenges a successful economic union will engender. Like all community endeav-\nours, however, there must be sacrifices and some legal systems may have to forgo long\ncherished doctrines and approaches to the subject. Compromises will have to be made\nbut the price of inaction can be high. Lessons could be drawn from the treatment of the\nsubject in other economic communities; however, the tendency to copy blindly should\nbe avoided. The African Union, its institutional organs, judges, lawyers and African\nacademics all have a role to play. The time to act is now.\nRICHARD FRIMPONG OPPONG*\n928 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n93 Thalia Kruger \u0091The South African Litigant and European Union Rules of Civil Procedure\u0092\n(2005) 38 CILSA 75; Charles T Kotuby \u0091Internal Developments and External Effects: The\nFederalization of Private International Law in the European Community and its Consequences for\nTransnational Litigants\u0092 (2001\u00962) 21 J of L & Commerce 157; JJ Fawcett \u0091The Europeanisation\nof Private International Law: The Significance for Singapore\u0092 [1997] Singapore J of Intl &\nComparative L 69.\n94 See, Recommendation to the Twentieth Session of the Hague Conference on Private\nInternational Law on the Admission of the European Community to the Hague Conference on\nPrivate International Law 31 March\u00961 April 2005.
