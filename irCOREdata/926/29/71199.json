The onset of several\nminute perturbations in the magnetospheric field was ob-\nserved in conjunction with a southward turn of the interplan-\netary magnetic field observed upstream by the ACE space-\ncraft and lagged to the subsolar magnetopause.

Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere) Magentosphe-\nric physics (magnetopause, cusp and boundary layers; mag-\nnetosphere-ionosphere interactions)\n1 Introduction\nReconnection at the dayside magnetopause boundary is the\ndominant mechanism by which energy and momentum are\ntransferred from the solar wind into the Earth\u2019s magneto-\nsphere. As such, an understanding of reconnection at this\nboundary and its consequences is central to any efforts to\nquantify the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling. Signatures\nindicating that the reconnection process is often of a transient\nnature were first obtained by Haerendel et al. (1978) using\nhigh-latitude magnetic field data from the HEOS-2 space-\ncraft, and by Russell and Elphic (1978, 1979) using lower\nlatitude data from ISEE-1 and -2. These studies revealed the\nexistence of characteristic transient signatures in the mag-\nnetic field in the vicinity of the magnetopause, which have\na time scale of a few minutes, and a recurrence interval of\n\u223c 5\u201310 min. These signatures were termed \u201cflux erosion\nevents\u201d by Haerendel et al. (1978) and \u201cflux transfer events\u201d\n(FTEs) by Russell and Elphic (1978, 1979). Later, Rijnbeek\nand Cowley (1984) demonstrated that these represent essen-\ntially the same phenomenon. The characteristics of these\nevents include bipolar signatures in the field component nor-\nmal to the magnetopause, field tilting effects in the plane\nof the magnetopause, and mixed plasma populations origi-\n1492 J. A. Wild et al.: First simultaneous observations of flux transfer events at the high-latitude magnetopause\nnating both in the magnetosphere and magnetosheath (e.g.\nPaschmann et al., 1982; Farrugia et al., 1988).\nRussell and Elphic (1978, 1979) offered a physical inter-\npretation of FTEs as arising from transient (a few minutes)\nand spatially localised (few RE) episodes of reconnection at\nthe magnetopause. The reconnection interpretation was later\nsupported by studies showing a strong association of FTE\noccurrence with southward fields in the magnetosheath and\ninterplanetary medium (Rijnbeek et al., 1984; Berchem and\nRussell, 1984; Kawano and Russell, 1997). Southwood et\nal. (1988) and Scholer (1988) suggested that the structures\ncould also be formed by transient reconnection at sites that\nare more extended along the magnetopause. Most recently,\nMilan et al. (2000) have presented evidence based on UV\nauroral imager data and HF radar data suggesting that the re-\nconnection site may at any one time be spatially localised,\nbut that it propagates wave-like over the magnetopause for\nextended distances and intervals of time (at least \u223c 10 min).\nThe spatial structure of the reconnection geometry at the\nmagnetopause has an impact on the form of the expected\nflow signatures in the dayside ionosphere, depending upon\nwhether it is patchy, extended, or wave-like, and a vari-\nety of theoretical pictures have been put forth to describe\nthe expectations in these cases (e.g. Southwood, 1985, 1987;\nCowley, 1986; McHenry and Clauer, 1987; Lockwood et\nal., 1990; Wei and Lee, 1990; Cowley et al., 1991; Cowley\nand Lockwood, 1992; Milan et al., 2000). Correspondingly,\nconsiderable efforts have been made to observe the signa-\ntures of FTEs in the polar ionosphere. The first ground-\nbased observations which were identified as potential flux\ntransfer events were published by van Eyken et al. (1984)\nand Goertz et al. (1985). Van Eyken et al. (1984) studied\nEISCAT UHF radar data and observed a brief northward ex-\ncursion in an otherwise westward flow. Goertz et al. (1985)\nused data from the STARE VHF coherent radar to detect a\nconvection boundary in the radar\u2019s field-of-view. Poleward\nof this boundary, the flow was observed to be anti-sunward,\nwith an occasional significant north-south component. Flows\nacross the convection boundary occurred sporadically in spa-\ntially localised regions with scale sizes between 50\u2013300 km,\nand with a repetition rate of the order of minutes. In one\nparticular event, Goertz et al. (1985) reported observing a\npoleward-moving transient which grew and decayed over a\n4 min interval. The transient flows were interpreted as the\nresult of newly-reconnected flux tubes being pulled pole-\nward by the magnetosheath flow. Subsequently, Lockwood\net al. (1989, 1993) used data from the EISCAT incoherent\nscatter radar to observe flow enhancements which were as-\nsociated with dayside auroral transients. These were also\ninterpreted as being related to FTEs observed at the mag-\nnetopause.\nHF coherent radars have more recently provided a wealth\nof observations which have similarly been associated with\nflux transfer events. The radars typically observe high veloc-\nity anti-sunward transient flow in the cusp ionosphere. Such\nsignatures were first assumed to be the response to transient\nmagnetopause reconnection by Pinnock et al. (1993, 1995)\nand Rodger and Pinnock (1997). Quasi-periodic sequences\nof such events, termed pulsed ionospheric flows (PIFs), have\nsubsequently been examined both statistically and individ-\nually, and the spatial extent of these events, their flow ori-\nentation, MLT occurrence, dependence on IMF orientation,\nand repetition frequencies have been extensively examined\n(Provan et al., 1998, 1999; Provan and Yeoman, 1999; Milan\net al., 1999b, 2000; McWilliams et al., 2000).\nIn spite of the progress made in characterizing FTEs at\nthe magnetopause and their effects in the polar ionosphere, it\nwas not until the study of Elphic et al. (1990) that simultane-\nous observations of an FTE at the magnetopause and the flow\nresponse in the near-conjugate ionosphere became available.\nAlthough the EISCAT radar observations were limited to two\npointing directions and a 5 min measurement cycle, Elphic\nand co-workers showed evidence of transient reconnection at\nthe magnetopause and a simultaneous flow response in the\npolar ionosphere. These data, obtained during one observing\ninterval, remained unique until the advent of the Equator-\nS mission. Neudegg et al. (1999) presented a single case\nstudy of a southward turning of the IMF which resulted in\nthe observation of a clear magnetospheric FTE in the magne-\ntometer data of the Equator-S spacecraft, located in the vicin-\nity of the magnetopause. This was accompanied almost si-\nmultaneously by the onset of transient poleward-propagating\nflow signatures in the SuperDARN Hankasalmi (CUTLASS)\nradar. Prior to the southward turning of the IMF, there had\nbeen an extended interval of northward IMF during which\nno such ionospheric signatures were observed. The iono-\nspheric flow data in this study was of excellent quality, with\na 30 km range resolution, and a 2 s dwell time per beam, giv-\ning a full scan of the 16 radar beams every 32 s, allowing\nfor an accurate picture of the ionospheric convection to be\ndeduced. This ionospheric flow response was fully in ac-\ncord with those HF radar results based upon ground-based\ndata alone. Subsequently, it was demonstrated by Neudegg\net al. (2001) that the high-latitude convection response to the\nreconnection process associated with this magnetopause FTE\nexcited strong UV aurora equatorward of the footprint of the\nnewly-reconnected field lines.\nA more statistical study was performed by Neudegg et\nal. (2000), who examined the characteristic signatures of\nFTEs at the magnetopause, as observed by the Equator-S\nspacecraft, with the characteristic pulsed anti-sunward flows\nobserved in the HF radar data in the ionosphere at the con-\njugate footprint of Equator-S. They found a strong associa-\ntion between the magnetopause and ionospheric phenomena.\nThey also suggested that for FTEs with a repetition rate of\ngreater than 5 min, a clear one-to-one correlation often ex-\nisted between magnetopause and ionospheric events. For\nfaster repetition rates, the ionospheric response began to re-\nsemble that expected from a continuous flow excitation. The\noverall flow patterns observed in association with the FTEs\nwere in broad agreement with those predicted theoretically,\nbut showed a wide spectrum of responses on an event-by-\nevent basis.\nDespite the above cited studies by Elphic et al. and\nJ.

This field model is parameterised by the solar wind dynamic pressure p, the IMF, and Dst .\nThe values chosen here are p = 1 nPa, IMF BY =3 nT, IMF BZ = \u22125 nT, and Dst = \u221215 nT, corresponding to prevailing conditions near\nthe time of the boundary region encounter (\u223c 10:00\u201311:00 UT). The field lines are terminated when they reach the model magnetopause.\nThe model magnetopause position in the plane of the two diagrams is shown by the solid lines. In the right-hand panel, field lines are also\nterminated when they reach the GSM equatorial plane.\nNeudegg et al. the number of ground-satellite conjunctions\navailable for investigation remain few in number, and our\nknowledge of the detailed ionospheric flow response to vari-\nous magnetopause reconnection scenarios, for example, FTE\nsize, location, propagation, and repetition rates, remains\nincomplete. For this reason, an extensive programme of\nground-based radar observations is currently under way to\nobserve ionospheric conditions in the regions conjugate to\nthe Cluster spacecraft, particularly during spacecraft traver-\nsals of the magnetopause region. In this paper, we present\nthe first simultaneous observations of FTEs in the magne-\ntopause region by the Cluster spacecraft, and pulsed features\nin the conjugate ionosphere by the CUTLASS and EISCAT\nSvalbard radars.\n2 Instrumentation\nThis paper investigates magnetometer data from an outbound\npass of the Cluster spacecraft through the post-noon high-\nlatitude magnetopause region, together with simultaneous\nionospheric data obtained in the conjugate ionosphere by the\nCUTLASS (SuperDARN) and EISCAT radars. The observa-\ntions were made on 14 February 2001. Upstream interplane-\ntary parameters from the ACE spacecraft are also employed\nto provide context. In this section, we first provide a brief\ndescription of the instruments used in the study, and outline\nthe experimental arrangements prevailing during the obser-\nvations. We start with the space-based instruments, and then\nproceed to the ground-based systems.\n2.1 Cluster FGM magnetometer data\nThe ESA Cluster mission allows for the first time the study\nof the small-scale spatial and temporal characteristics of the\ngeospace environment (Escoubet et al., 1997). The mission\nconsists of four identical spacecraft orbiting the Earth in a\ntetrahedral formation, with an orbital perigee of around 4RE ,\nan apogee of 19.6RE , and a period of approximately 57 h.\nThe plane of the orbit is inclined at approximately 90\u25e6 to\nthe equatorial plane, and is fixed in an inertial system such\nthat the Earth\u2019s motion around the Sun causes the location\nof apogee to precess through 24 hours of local time with a\ntwelve month periodicity. In Fig. 1, we show the orbit and\nevolution of the tetrahedral configuration of the four space-\ncraft during 06:00\u201316:00 UT on 14 February 2001.

The principal period of interest for this\nstudy is \u223c 09:00\u201311:00 UT, when the spacecraft were at ra-\ndial distances of \u223c 11\u201313RE in the region of the magne-\ntopause. The locations of the remaining three Cluster space-\ncraft (Salsa, Samba, and Tango) are also shown at each hour,\nalthough the inter-spacecraft separation has been magnified\nby a factor of ten relative to Cluster 1 in order to more easily\ndisplay the tetrahedral geometry of the formation. Magne-\ntospheric field lines derived from the Tsyganenko-96 field\nmodel (Tsyganenko, 1995, 1996), that pass through the lo-\ncation of Cluster 1 at the one hour markers are represented\nby dotted lines (such lines are terminated when they reach\nthe model magnetopause surface). The model is parame-\nterised by the solar wind dynamic pressurep, the IMF, and\nDst . The values chosen here are p =1 nPa, IMF BY =5 nT,\nIMF BZ = \u22123 nT, and Dst = \u221215 nT, corresponding to\nprevailing conditions near the time of the boundary region\nencounter (\u223c 09:30\u201310:30 UT). Finally, the solid lines indi-\ncate the location of the Tsyganenko-96 model magnetopause\nin the plane of each of the diagrams.\nEach Cluster spacecraft is equipped with an identical pay-\nload comprising of eleven particle and field instruments. This\nstudy will draw upon measurements from one of these, name-\nly the fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) experiment (Balogh et\nal., 1997). FGM is capable of providing high accuracy (up\nto 8 pT) vectors of the ambient magnetic field at high sam-\nple rates (up to 67 vectors\/s). For purposes of this study,\nhowever, all FGM data have been analysed at a temporal res-\nolution equal to the spin period of the spacecraft (\u223c 4 s).\n2.2 ACE interplanetary data\nUpstream solar wind and IMF conditions during the interval\ndiscussed in this paper were measured using the SWEPAM\nand MAG instruments, respectively, on the Advanced Com-\nposition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft (McComas et al., 1998;\nSmith et al., 1998; Stone et al., 1998). During the relevant\ninterval on 14 February 2001, ACE was located in the solar\nwind near the Sun-Earth L1 libration point, at GSM coordi-\nnates (X, Y,Z) = (+237.3,\u221237.6,+3.5)RE . The propaga-\ntion delay between field signatures appearing at the space-\ncraft and their arrival at the subsolar magnetopause has been\nestimated using the algorithm described by Khan and Cow-\nley (1999). This algorithm takes into account the propaga-\ntion of IMF features from the solar wind to the bow shock\nand then across the magnetosheath to the magnetopause,\nusing empirical model values of the location of the latter\nboundaries keyed to observed solar wind parameters. For\nconditions during the period of interest (nSW \u223c 1\u20133 cm\u22123,\nVSW \u223c 500 km\/s), the propagation delay is determined at\n\u223c 55 min, such that the ACE magnetometer data displayed\nbelow have been lagged by this interval for comparison with\nCluster observations near the magnetopause.\n2.3 CUTLASS radar data\nFigure 2 illustrates the geographical coverage of the ground-\nbased instruments employed in this study. Observations of\nionospheric convection velocities are provided by the CUT-\nLASS radar system. This comprises of a pair of HF coherent-\nscatter radars located at Hankasalmi, Finland and Pykkvib\u00e6r,\nIceland, which form part of the international SuperDARN\nchain (Greenwald et al., 1995). Each radar is frequency agile\n(8\u201320 MHz), and routinely measures the line-of-sight (l-o-s)\nDoppler velocity, spectral width, and the backscatter power\nfrom ionospheric plasma irregularities. In normal operation\n(as here), the field-of-view (f-o-v) of each radar (shaded grey\nin Fig. 2) is formed by sequentially scanning through 16\nbeams of azimuthal separation 3.24\u25e6, with each beam gated\ninto 75 ranges of 45 km length. The directions of the cen-\ntres of beams 1\u20133 and 8 of the Finland radar are indicated in\nFig. 2 for future reference. Typically, the dwell time on each\nbeam is 3 or 7 s, resulting in a scan of the complete f-o-v cov-\nering 52\u25e6 in azimuth and over 3000 km in range every 1 or\n2 min. During the interval encompassed by this paper, both\nCUTLASS radars were operated in the higher time resolution\nmode, such that 1 min data is available.\nOverlaid on Fig. 2 are the locations of the ionospheric\nfield line footprints of the Cluster 1 spacecraft at 100 km\naltitude, obtained from the Tsyganenko-96 field mappings,\nparameterised as above. These are presented at 5 min inter-\nvals, each one colour-coded according to the scale on the\nright to indicate the radial position of the spacecraft. Fol-\nlowing perigee at \u223c 02:00 UT, the footprint travelled pole-\nward over Greenland and into the north polar region, be-\nJ. A. Wild et al.: First simultaneous observations of flux transfer events at the high-latitude magnetopause 1495\nfore beginning an equatorward and westward track through\nthe CUTLASS fields-of-view that passed over the Svalbard\narchipelago at \u223c 10:30 UT. The spacecraft crossed the loca-\ntion of the model magnetopause at \u223c 11:35 UT, after which\nthe field line tracing is terminated. The observations pre-\nsented below show that the magnetopause region was ac-\ntually crossed at \u223c 10:30 UT, with the implication that the\nspacecraft footprints were then located near Svalbard, cen-\ntrally within the CUTLASS f-o-v. It is acknowledged that\nthese model mappings become relatively less certain as the\nmagnetopause is approached. However, as investigation has\nshown that the model magnetic field employed here is quite\nclose to the field observed by Cluster. This lends some con-\nfidence that our mappings represent reasonable estimates for\nthe purposes for which they have been employed.\n2.4 EISCAT Svalbard radar data\nThe EISCAT Svalbard radar (ESR) facility at Longyear-\nbyen (Wannberg et al., 1997), which operates at frequencies\naround 500 MHz, comprises of two separate co-located an-\ntennas, a fixed 42 m dish and a fully steerable 32 m dish. The\nfixed antenna is aligned along the local magnetic field direc-\ntion, which corresponds to a geographic azimuth of 181.0\u25e6,\nwith an elevation of 81.6\u25e6. The location of the antenna is\nshown by the circled dot in Fig. 2. During the conjunction\nwith the Cluster spacecraft, the steerable dish was directed\nnorthward at low elevation, with a geographic azimuth of\n336.0\u25e6, and an elevation of 30.0\u25e6. The direction of the beam\nis indicated by the heavy black line in Fig. 2, which almost\ncoincides with the CUTLASS Finland beam 8. Observations\nwith a dwell time of 64 s were made alternately on each beam\nusing an alternating code pulse scheme. The effective time\nresolution of the data on each beam was thus 128 s. Anal-\nysis using the GUISDAP algorithm (Lehtinen and Huusko-\nnen, 1996) then provides estimates of the electron density,\nion and electron temperature, and ion velocity, from the 90\nto 1070 km range along each beam. Although this is approx-\nimately equivalent to the altitude coverage for observations\nalong the near-vertical field-aligned beam, the low elevation\nobservations span some 50 to 600 km in altitude, with a lati-\ntude coverage indicated by the length of the black line shown\nin Fig. 2.\n3 Observations\n3.1 Cluster data\nIn Fig. 3, we display ACE and Cluster magnetic field data for\nthe two-hour interval of 09:15 to 11:15 UT on 14 February\n2001, which encompasses the outbound Cluster transition\nbetween the magnetosphere and magnetosheath. The up-\nper panels show the GSM components of the IMF, measured\nupstream of the Earth by the ACE spacecraft. The data are\nshown at 16 s resolution, and have been lagged by 55 min\nto the subsolar magnetopause, as indicated above. The up-\nstream IMF was directed nearly continuously southward dur-\ning the interval, withBZ \u223c \u22123 nT, having turned from north-\nward values at a (lagged) time of 08:53 UT. The IMF also\nhad weaker positive Y (\u223c 5 nT) and near-zero X components\nwhich became more variable after \u223c 10:30 UT.\nBeneath the IMF data we show Cluster magnetometer\ndata. The data are presented with a 4 s resolution, and for\ninitial clarity, we show data only from Cluster 1 (Rumba).\nThe data from the other Cluster spacecraft show similar fea-\ntures, as we will indicate below. The top three panels of\nCluster data show the three field components in boundary\nnormal coordinates (Russell and Elphic, 1978), where N is\nthe estimated outward normal to the magnetopause, L lies in\nthe boundary and points north (such that the L \u2212 N plane\ncontains the GSM Z-axis), and M also lies in the boundary\nand points west, orthogonal to L and N (such that (L,M,N )\nforms a right-handed coordinate system). Note that the scale\nof the panel showing the N component is half that of the pan-\nels showing the L and M components, in order that the vari-\nations in BN can be clearly seen. Beneath these, we show the\ntotal field strength, and the angle of the field in the plane of\nthe magnetopause, \u03b1LM , defined as \u03b1LM = arctan(BM\/BL).\nFinally, at the foot of the figure, we show position data for the\nspacecraft, specifically the geocentric radial distance (RE),\nand the GSM local time and latitude. We note for future\nreference that the magnetopause crossings near the centre of\nthe interval occurred at a radial distance of \u223c12RE , a post-\nnoon GSM local time of \u223c 14.2 h, and a GSM latitude of\n\u223c 61\u25e6. In fact, this location is very close to that at which the\noriginal \u201cflux erosion events\u201d were observed by Haerendel et\nal. (1978) in HEOS-2 data (at \u223c 13RE , \u223c 13.6 h, and \u223c 64\u25e6,\nsee also Rijnbeek and Cowley, 1984).\nThe outward magnetopause normal for the Cluster data\nhas been determined by minimum variance analysis of the\nCluster 1 data during the interval of 10:00\u201310:40 UT, an in-\nterval which contains the boundary layer traversal and all\nthree magnetopause transitions. This normal is thus taken\nto be representative of the boundary region as a whole. In-\nvestigation shows that near similar directions are obtained\nfrom the data from all four Cluster spacecraft over the in-\nterval, and that the direction is also relatively insensitive to\nthe precise interval analysed. For all four spacecraft, the\ndifference in magnitude between the intermediate and mini-\nmum eigenvalues of the covariance matrix was found to be\na factor of \u223c 8, indicating that the calculated minimum vari-\nance direction was robust in each case. Furthermore, much\nshorter (5 min) intervals were also investigated spanning each\nof the magnetopause transitions. In each case, the normals\ndetermined from each spacecraft were found to be consis-\ntent, and to differ in direction by less than \u223c 20\u25e6 from that\ngiven above for the whole boundary region. Such differences\nproduce essentially no qualitative change in the boundary\nnormal coordinate data plots. Therefore, we have adopted\nhere the outward normal direction determined from the inter-\nval of 10:00\u201310:40 UT, given by GSM components (+0.669,\n\u22120.262, +0.696). The comparable positive X and Z com-\nponents seem reasonable for a magnetopause transition at\nhigh-latitudes in the vicinity of the cusp (see the model shape\n1496 J. A. Wild et al.: First simultaneous observations of flux transfer events at the high-latitude magnetopause\nFigure 3\nFig. 3. Plot of the magnetic field observations made by the ACE and Cluster 1 (Rumba) spacecraft during the interval 09:15\u201311:15 UT\non 14 February 2001. The top three panels show the GSM components of the upstream IMF measured by the ACE spacecraft, lagged by\n55 min to the subsolar magnetopause. These data are shown at 16 s resolution. The following panels then show the three components of\nthe Cluster 1 magnetic field in boundary normal coordinates (see text), the field magnitude, and the angle of the field in the plane of the\nmagnetopause relative to the GSM northward direction, \u03b1LM . These data are at spacecraft spin (\u223c 4 s) resolution. At the foot of the figure,\nwe show Cluster 1 position data, specifically the geocentric radial distance, and GSM local time and latitude. The vertical dashed lines\nindicate times of particular interest, namely the centres of flux transfer events (FTEs), the inner edge of the magnetopause boundary layer\n(BL), and magnetopause current sheet crossings (MP).\nJ. A. Wild et al.: First simultaneous observations of flux transfer events at the high-latitude magnetopause 1497\nshown in Fig. 1), while the small, negative Y component is\nperhaps surprising for a post-noon transition. However, the\nnegative Y component is consistently present in the normals\ndetermined from each spacecraft, and for the various inter-\nvals investigated. It suggests that the magnetopause surface\nis significantly dimpled inwards in the vicinity of the cusp at\nnoon, such that the boundary normal in the immediate high-\nlatitude post-noon sector (\u223c 14.2 hr GSM MLT for this cross-\ning) is deflected modestly towards dawn. A similar orienta-\ntion of the post-noon magnetopause was found previously\nby Rijnbeek and Cowley (1984) in the study of the HEOS-\n2 high-latitude \u201cflux erosion events\u201d mentioned above (the\nGSM normal vector in that case was determined as (+0.649,\n\u22120.081, +0.757)).\nAt the beginning of the interval shown in Fig. 3, the space-\ncraft was located within the magnetosphere where the field\nstrength was\u223c 20 nT and directed principally southward and\nwestward (BL negative, BM positive). As the magnetopause\nwas approached, however, the L component drifted towards\nnear-zero and in a positive (northward) direction. At the\nend of the interval, the spacecraft was located in the mag-\nnetosheath where the field was still \u223c 20 nT, but much more\nrapidly varying, and directed southward and eastward (BL\nand BM are negative). The latter directions are qualitatively\nconsistent with the expectations based on the upstream IMF\ndirection. Three principal magnetopause boundary cross-\nings have been identified, indicated by the vertical dashed\nlines marked \u201cMP\u201d. These occur at \u223c 10:17, \u223c 10:22, and\n\u223c 10:33 UT and, as indicated above, mark transitions be-\ntween fields on the magnetospheric side which have (primar-\nily) positive L and M components, and fields on the mag-\nnetosheath side which have (primarily) negative L and M\ncomponents.\nDuring the initial magnetospheric interval, prior to the first\nmagnetopause encounter, the field became increasingly vari-\nable in both direction and magnitude as the magnetopause\nwas approached. These variations appear to have begun near\n\u223c 09:00 UT, shortly after the (lagged) IMF turned southward\nat the subsolar magnetopause. It seems clear that this vari-\nability was connected with ongoing dynamic phenomena in\nthe boundary region. These field variations culminated in the\n\u223c 30 min interval prior to the first magnetopause encounter,\nwith the observation of four clear magnetospheric FTEs, cen-\ntred near \u223c 09:45, \u223c 09:54, \u223c 09:59, and \u223c 10:04 UT, which\nare also marked by dashed vertical lines. These FTEs are all\nindicated by bipolar positive-to-negative (\u201cnormal\u201d polarity)\nexcursions in the N component of the field, together with in-\ncreases in the field strength. We also note that the first of\nthese FTEs appears to have been preceded and followed by\nsmaller amplitude perturbations of a similar kind. The varia-\ntion in \u03b1LM shows that the field direction in the plane of the\nmagnetopause rotated away from the magnetosheath field di-\nrection at the spacecraft in the first FTE. The field direction\ndid not rotate significantly in the second FTE, but did ro-\ntate through a small angle towards the magnetosheath field\ndirection in the third FTE, and underwent a large rotation to-\nwards the magnetosheath field direction in the fourth FTE.\nThe latter rotation was associated with a large increase in\nBL from near-zero outside the event to \u223c25 nT inside, while\ntheBM component underwent a simultaneous reduction from\n\u223c15 nT outside the event to \u223c \u22125 nT inside. In effect, the\nfield in the plane of the magnetopause rotated through \u223c90\u25e6\nfrom a magnetospheric near-westward orientation to point\nnorthward and slightly eastward. We note that the sense of\nthe latter perturbations is very similar to those of the \u201cflux\nerosion events\u201d observed by HEOS-2 at a similar location\nunder similar magnetosheath circumstances.\nAfter the observation of the four magnetospheric FTEs,\nthe spacecraft entered a magnetopause boundary layer at\n\u223c 10:09 UT, which endured until the first magnetopause\ncrossing at \u223c 10:17 UT. Although highly variable, the direc-\ntion of the field in this layer was generally similar to that\nwithin the centre of the final clear FTE, i.e. it was directed\nnorthward and eastward, sheared towards the direction of the\nfield in the magnetosheath. The field strength was also vari-\nable, but significantly elevated over that found in both the\nmagnetosphere and magnetosheath, reaching peak values of\n\u223c 50 nT. Following the transition into the magnetosheath at\n\u223c 10:17 UT, the spacecraft then briefly re-entered the mag-\nnetosphere between \u223c 10:22 and \u223c 10:33 UT. In these cases,\nthe magnetopause transitions were relatively rapid and as-\nsociated with brief spike-like perturbations in all three field\ncomponents. However, only modest field perturbations were\nobserved within the brief magnetospheric interval, with no\nFTEs. In the following traversal of the magnetosheath, how-\never, FTEs were again observed. Two prominent exam-\nples are centred near \u223c 10:46 and \u223c 11:01 UT, with events\nof smaller amplitude occurring at \u223c 10:36 and \u223c 10:43 UT.\nThese are also indicated by dashed vertical lines, and show\n\u201cnormal\u201d polarity bipolar signatures in the N field compo-\nnent, together with variable tilting effects in the plane of the\nmagnetopause. Other FTE-type field structures may also be\npresent in the magnetosheath, associated with small ampli-\ntude or shorter-lived field features.\nOur interpretation of the field perturbations observed dur-\ning these FTE events is sketched in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4a, we\nshow a cut in a magnetic meridian in the noon sector a few\nminutes after a burst of reconnection has occurred at low-\nlatitudes. A bulge of newly-reconnected field lines propa-\ngates over the magnetopause towards the cusp, and from then\non into the tail lobe. Its passage is marked by a bipolar sig-\nnature in the N field component in both the magnetosphere\nand the magnetosheath, in which the field first points out-\nwards and then inwards, as observed. The size of the bulge\n(for a large amplitude FTE) is \u223c 1RE normal to the mag-\nnetopause (Saunders et al., 1984), and several RE along the\nmagnetopause in the plane of the diagram (such that with\na propagation speed over the magnetopause of a few hun-\ndred km\/s, the propagation time across a given point will be\n\u223c 1\u20132 min). Of course, in the presence of a significant BY\ncomponent in the IMF, positive in the present case, the re-\nconnected field lines will not lie directly in the plane of this\ndiagram, but will be tilted out of the plane by the effect of\nthe field tension. This is indicated by the field component di-\n1498 J. A. Wild et al.: First simultaneous observations of flux transfer events at the high-latitude magnetopause\nrected out of the plane of the diagram which has been drawn\nwithin the FTE (and which is also present, of course, in the\nmagnetosheath).\nField tilting effects in the plane of the magnetopause are\nshown more clearly in Fig. 4b. This shows a sketch of the\ndayside magnetopause viewed from the Sun, where the ar-\nrowed dashed lines show undisturbed magnetospheric field\nlines in the magnetopause layer. The arrowed solid lines\nshow individual field lines of a given FTE at a fixed instant\nof time, which originated from a propagating burst of low-\nlatitude reconnection. Specifically, in line with the recent\nobservations presented by Milan et al. (2000), we assume\nthat reconnection starts in a burst close to the noon merid-\nian, giving rise to field line \u201c1\u201d (plus neighbouring open field\nlines), and then propagates to later local times, giving rise\nsequentially to field lines \u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d, and \u201c4\u201d. The latter field\nlines have thus undergone sequentially less evolution over\nthe magnetopause since reconnection, originating from re-\nconnection sites displaced increasingly duskward of noon.\nThus, field line \u201c4\u201d, for example, has only just been recon-\nnected at the time of the figure, thus marking the approxi-\nmate location of the reconnection region at that time. Field\nlines reconnected earlier, closer to noon, are relatively more\nevolved. The reconnection region may also propagate simul-\ntaneously dawnward from noon to earlier local times as well,\nbut the effect of this (giving rise to \u201cyounger\u201d open tubes\non the dawn flank as well) has not been represented in the\nfigure. After reconnection has taken place, the combined ac-\ntion of the magnetic tension of the newly-opened field lines\nand magnetosheath flow causes them to contract poleward\nand westward (for positive IMF BY ) as indicated, forming\na sunward-moving boundary layer in the post-noon magne-\ntopause, as described, for example, by the simple magne-\ntopause reconnection model of Cowley and Owen (1989).\nAs can then be seen, the effect of the field tension is such\nthat it causes the newly-opened magnetospheric flux tubes\nto rotate towards a poleward and eastward orientation. In\nother words, the field direction in the high-latitude magne-\ntospheric boundary region at Cluster (shown in the figure by\nthe spacecraft symbol) should rotate clockwise in the plane\nof the magnetopause, from positive M towards positive L\nand negative M . This scenario is thus qualitatively consis-\ntent with the sense of the principal FTE and boundary layer\nfield perturbations seen in Fig. 3. The \u201creversed\u201d and reduced\nfield tilting effects observed in the first three magnetospheric\nFTEs marked in the figure, as compared with the fourth, is\ndue to the larger distances from the magnetopause in the ear-\nlier events, combined with a twisting of the field within the\nFTE structure, as previously discussed, for example, by Cow-\nley (1982), Paschmann et al. (1982), Saunders et al. (1984),\nSouthwood et al. (1988), and Wright and Berger (1989). The\ntwisting is often such that in the outer part of the FTE, the\nfield may tilt away from the direction of the field on the other\nside of the boundary. Such tilts can also be produced in the\nunreconnected field immediately outside the FTE due to the\nflows induced in the surrounding medium by the passage of\nthe FTE structure (Southwood, 1985; Cowley, 1986).\nThe shearing of the field within the FTE structures can\nalso be seen directly in the four spacecraft Cluster magne-\ntometer data. In Fig. 5, we show such data for the magneto-\nspheric boundary region on an expanded time base (09:40\u2013\n10:20 UT), using the same boundary normal coordinate sys-\ntem as in Fig. 3 (this was determined specifically from Clus-\nter 1 data as indicated above, but the minimum variance\ndirections determined individually from all four spacecraft\nwere essentially identical). The vertical lines show the same\nprincipal times as in Fig. 3. The purple line corresponds to\ndata from Cluster 1 (Rumba), green to Cluster 2 (Salsa), yel-\nlow to Cluster 3 (Samba), and red to Cluster 4 (Tango) (the\nsame colour-coding as in Fig. 1). Assuming that the distance\nfrom the magnetopause is the principal organising parameter,\nwe note that Clusters 1\u20133 lie roughly in the same plane as the\nestimated plane of the magnetopause (within \u223c 60 km, i.e.\nwithin \u223c 0.01RE), while Cluster 4 lags behind these space-\ncraft by \u223c 510 km (\u223c 0.08RE) along the boundary normal.\nThe relatively small values of these displacements indicate\nthat only small-scale structures, with field variations on the\nscale of \u223c 0.1RE , or less, will result in marked differences\nin the field between the spacecraft. As indicated above, the\nspatial scale of large amplitude FTEs transverse to the mag-\nnetopause is \u223c 1RE . Only relatively minor differences in\nthe field values between the spacecraft are then expected for\nstructures of such size.\nExamination of Fig. 5 shows that in general the latter ex-\npectation is fulfilled (though, of course, the small differen-\nces observed will be vital to future detailed modelling stud-\nies). Careful examination of the data shows, however, that in\ngeneral, the field variations of Clusters 1\u20133 (purple, yellow,\nand green) track each other very well during the FTE events,\nwhile Cluster 4 shows a somewhat more markedly differ-\nent behaviour, with field perturbations of a smaller ampli-\ntude (see particularly the second to fourth FTEs). Within the\nboundary layer, however, we note the presence of field struc-\ntures in which zero-order differences in the field occurred be-\ntween the four spacecraft, particularly during the interval of\n\u223c 10:09\u201310:13 UT. In these structures, the largest field shear-\ning perturbations in the estimated plane of the magnetopause\nwere observed by Cluster 1, followed in order by 3, 2, and\n4. This ordering is not expected for a structure which simply\npropagates along the magnetopause normal in the orientation\ndetermined here; therefore, further study of the structure and\ngeometry of these events is warranted. We may already con-\nclude from these data, however, that the observed structures\nwere that of an FTE-like open flux tube, with a spatial scale\nof \u223c 0.1RE perpendicular to the magnetopause, compara-\nble to the normal separation of the Cluster spacecraft. The\nother FTE events noted here must clearly have had signif-\nicantly larger spatial scales than this, as will be elucidated\nwith further study of these data. The most reasonable picture\nof the boundary layer identified in these observations is that\nit was formed from nearly continuous but highly variable re-\nconnection at the magnetopause, in which the FTEs observed\nat larger distances represent the large-scale peaks extending\nfurther from the boundary. The field strength increases ob-\nJ. A.

A bulge of newly-reconnected\nopen flux tubes propagate poleward to the cusp, and from there into the tail. The open field lines are also twisted out of the meridian by\nthe Y component of the IMF, associated with the field component pointing out of the plane of the diagram marked BY as shown (which is\nalso present, of course, in the magnetosheath outside). The local boundary normal coordinate directions are also indicated, such that it can\nbe seen that the passage of the bulge will give rise to a bipolar signature in the N component. The dashed line beneath the bulge indicates\nthe tangential discontinuity magnetopause remaining after the bulge has passed by. (b) View of the Earth\u2019s dayside magnetopause looking\nfrom the Sun, showing individual field lines at one instant of time (solid lines with arrows) which were produced by a propagating burst of\nreconnection. Collectively, these open lines constitute a given FTE. We assume that the reconnection burst started near noon (producing field\nline \u201c1\u201d), and then propagated towards dusk, producing field lines \u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d, and \u201c4\u201d in sequence. \u201cLater\u201d field lines (like \u201c3\u201d and \u201c4\u201d) have\nthus undergone less evolution over the magnetopause since reconnection than \u201cearlier\u201d field lines (line \u201c1\u201d and \u201c2\u201d). Field line \u201c4\u201d has only\njust been reconnected at the time shown, thus marking the eastward boundary of the reconnection region at that time. The effect of a similar\nprogress from noon towards dawn has not been represented. The short-dashed lines with arrows indicate undisturbed magnetospheric field\nlines within the magnetospheric boundary region. The long-dashed lines indicate the latitudes of the equator (lower line) and cusp (upper\nline). The field tension effect on the open flux tubes is to cause them to contract poleward and dawnward over the magnetopause, as shown\nby the arrows, such that the field in the high-latitude post-noon boundary layer at Cluster (shown by the spacecraft symbol) tilts clockwise\nfrom westward towards northward and eastward orientations.\nserved both in the FTEs and in the boundary layer structures\nserve to emphasise the essentially 3-D nature of these phe-\nnomena. The increases in field (and total) pressure are due\nto the effect of the field tension of the overlying (and under-\nlying) field lines, and of the field twisting inside the struc-\ntures. In near slab-like magnetopause structures, the total\npressure would be preserved in passing through the bound-\nary, and large increases in field pressure as observed here\nwould not be expected.\n3.2 CUTLASS radar data\nThe Cluster data presented above indicate the presence of\npulsed reconnection at the dusk magnetopause which per-\nturbs the field in the high-latitude boundary region, both in\nthe magnetosphere and magnetosheath. We have previously\nseen in Fig. 2 that these boundary field lines are expected to\nmap magnetically to the central portion of the fields-of-view\nof the CUTLASS radars, and also close to the beams of the\nEISCAT Svalbard radar. In this section, we now examine the\nconcurrent radar data.\nDuring the interval of interest, both CUTLASS radars\nwere observing the dayside auroral zone close to local noon,\nas indicated above. Fig. 6 shows the backscatter observed by\nthe radars in a geomagnetic latitude and MLT format where\nthe dashed radial lines show one hour intervals of local time\n(noon being vertical), and the concentric dashed circles indi-\ncate magnetic latitudes of 70\u25e6 and 80\u25e6. The solid lines indi-\ncate a statistical auroral oval, and the black dot is the mapped\nCluster footprint. Data are shown at two times. The first\nis 09:50 UT, close to the start of the interval during which\nCluster observed magnetospheric FTEs when the spacecraft\nfootprint was located approximately 1 h MLT to the east of\nSvalbard. The second is 10:37 UT, shortly after the last Clus-\nter traversal of the magnetopause when the mapped footprint\nwas co-located with Svalbard. At 09:50 UT, backscatter was\nobserved by both CUTLASS radars (Figs. 6a and b), but\n1500 J. A. Wild et al.: First simultaneous observations of flux transfer events at the high-latitude magnetopause\nFigure 5\nFig. 5. Four spacecraft Cluster magnetometer data for the interval 09:40\u201310:20 UT are shown in boundary normal coordinates in the same\nformat as in Fig. 3. The coordinate system is also the same as in Fig. 3. Data from Cluster 1, 2, 3, and 4 are shown by the purple, green,\nyellow, and red lines, respectively. The vertical dashed lines indicate the FTEs, boundary layer inner edge (BL), and magnetopause crossings\n(MP), as in Fig. 3.\nonly the Finland radar observed backscatter of significance at\n10:37 UT (Fig. 6c). The radar backscatter is colour-coded as\nDoppler velocity, i.e. the line-of-sight component of the bulk\nplasma drift. Positive velocities represent motion towards the\nradar. Regions colour-coded grey indicate backscatter echoes\nwith low Doppler velocity and low Doppler spread, which are\ngenerally interpreted as backscatter from the ground.\nThe Finland radar observations at 09:50 UT (Fig. 6a) show\ntwo main regions of ionospheric backscatter, one at lower lat-\nitudes (\u223c75\u25e6 geomagnetic) and the second at higher latitudes\n(poleward of 80\u25e6 latitude). Unfortunately, the first is embed-\nded within or superimposed on a region of ground backscat-\nter, which often means that the ACF analysis technique em-\nployed by the SuperDARN radars may have had trouble cor-\nrectly measuring the Doppler velocity. In the present case,\nhowever, the measurements do not appear to be affected. In\nthe western and eastern portions of the field-of-view, the line-\nof-sight velocity is directed away from and towards the radar,\nrespectively, indicating that the flow here has a significant\nwestward azimuthal component. Indeed, a beam-swinging\nanalysis of the velocities indicates that they are most consis-\ntent with a flow of 400 m\/s, directed 70\u25e6 to the west of ge-\nomagnetic north. The westward flow direction is consistent\nwith the plasma drift expected in the cusp region for posi-\ntive IMF BY (the \u201cSvalgaard-Mansurov effect\u201d), as is indeed\nobserved in the lagged IMF data from the ACE spacecraft\n(see Fig. 3). It is also consistent with the anticipated mo-\ntion of the northern hemisphere open flux tubes shown above\nin Fig. 4b (see the grey arrows in the vicinity of the cusp).\nPhysically, the westward motion is due to the effect of the\nmagnetic field tension associated with positive IMF BY , as\nindicated above. The second main region of backscatter lies\nwithin the polar cap and shows relatively low flow velocities.\nThese flows will be described further below, in conjunction\nwith ESR observations. The CUTLASS Iceland observations\nfrom this time (Fig. 6b) are consistent with the description of\nJ. A. Wild et al.: First simultaneous observations of flux transfer events at the high-latitude magnetopause 1501\nFigure 6\nFig. 6. Three panels illustrating the line-of-sight velocity measurements made by the (a) Finland and (b) Iceland CUTLASS radars at\n09:50 UT and (c) at 10:37 UT. The data are shown on a geomagnetic grid, with noon at the top and 70\u25e6 and 80\u25e6 latitude circles (dashed lines)\nshown. The solid lines show a statistical auroral oval, while the magnetically mapped Cluster footprint is shown by the black dot.\nthe Finland measurements. At the latitude of Svalbard where\nthere is overlap with backscatter in the Finland radar field-\nof-view, the Iceland radar recorded positive Doppler shifts,\nconsistent with westward flow. Just to the west of this is a\nregion of negative Doppler shifts, possibly indicating return\nflow in the dawn convection cell.\nTurning to the observations from 10:37 UT (Fig. 6c), the\nlower latitude region of backscatter is still present. The pat-\ntern of line-of-sight velocities within this region remains un-\nchanged, i.e. the flow is still directed predominantly west-\nwards. However, beam-swinging shows that the speed has\nincreased to be closer to 800 m\/s. A succession of beam-\nswinging analyses of the Doppler shifts within this region of\nbackscatter indicates that the flow magnitude increases grad-\nually from near 300 m\/s at 09:40 UT, to 800 m\/s at 10:25 UT,\nafter which it remains constant until the backscatter echoes\ndisappear at 10:45 UT. However, this behaviour is indicative\nof the behaviour of the background flow on large spatial and\ntemporal scales, and does not preclude the possibility of sig-\nnificant smaller scale features that could be associated with\nthe FTEs observed by Cluster. In addition to the westward\nflow region, a new region of backscatter is also observed in\nFig. 6c in the western portion of the field-of-view of the radar.\nThese echoes have high Doppler shifts directed away from\nthe radar, suggestive of a significant poleward component to\nthe plasma drift. It is backscatter of this nature which has\npreviously comprised the main radar signature of transient\nand impulsive flux transfer.\nFigure 7 concentrates on the Finland radar observations in\nthe western portion of the field-of-view. Although these data\nare obtained from locations displaced by \u223c 2 h MLT west\nof the estimated footprint of Cluster (Fig. 6), the direction\nof the beams ensures that the line-of-sight velocities are re-\nsponsive to the dominant east-west component of the flow\nin the lower latitude backscatter band. In general, we ex-\npect that large amplitude events, such as those investigated\nhere, should produce flow effects in the ionosphere of suffi-\nciently large enough spatial scale that related effects will still\nbe observed at such displacements (e.g. Milan et al., 2000).\nIn the upper panels of Fig. 7, we thus show magnetic lat-\nitude time plots of backscatter power and Doppler velocity\nfor beams 1, 2, and 3 (see Fig. 2), for the period of 09:15\nto 11:15 UT (as for the Cluster data in Fig. 3). Note that\nthe velocity colour scale employed in Fig. 7 is different from\nthat in Fig. 6. Since all flows observed in these beams dur-\ning this interval are directed away from the radar, only neg-\native Doppler shifts are shown. At lower latitudes, a region\nof ground backscatter is seen between 09:30 and 10:30 UT\nin all three beams. Just poleward of this, between the lati-\ntudes of 74\u25e6 and 76\u25e6, relatively low Doppler shift ionospheric\nbackscatter is observed, corresponding to the region of west-\nward flows identified in Fig. 6. Poleward of this, again above\n76\u25e6 in latitude, higher Doppler shifts are present. Again,\nit is these echoes which, in the past, have been identified\nas the radar signature of FTEs. Pinnock et al. (1995) and\nProvan et al. (1998) described the radar signature of FTEs\nas \u201cpulsed ionospheric flows\u201d or PIFs, i.e. poleward-moving\nregions of enhanced convection flow in the dayside auroral\nzone. These are often also seen as poleward-moving re-\ngions of backscatter or enhanced backscatter power, the radar\ncounterpart of \u201cpoleward-moving auroral forms\u201d (PMAFs),\nwidely accepted to be the auroral signature of FTEs (e.g.\nSandholt et al., 1990; Thorolfsson et al., 2000). In the fol-\nlowing discussion we will refer to these radar PMAFs as\n\u201cpoleward-moving radar auroral forms\u201d or PMRAFs. (As a\nslight digression, we note that care should be taken in the\nuse of \u201cPIF\u201d and \u201cPMRAF\u201d nomenclature, which are of-\nten erroneously used interchangeably, i.e. it is not possible\nto say whether or not isolated PMRAFs are associated with\na PIF since no measurements of the ionospheric flow pre-\nceding or following the PMRAF are made (as no backscat-\nter is observed). The lack of backscatter before or after the\nPMRAF does not necessarily indicate that a change in con-\nvection flow has occurred, only that no targets were present\nfrom which the radar could scatter.) Depending on the ex-\nact nature of the convection response to transient reconnec-\n1502 J. A. Wild et al.: First simultaneous observations of flux transfer events at the high-latitude magnetopause\nFigure 7\nFig. 7. Three pairs of backscatter\npower and Doppler shift measurements\nfrom beams 1, 2, and 3 of the Fin-\nland radar are shown, covering the same\ntime interval as for the Cluster data\nin Fig. 3. In the power panels, black\nindicates an insufficient signal-to-noise\nratio used to determine the spectral\ncharacteristics of the backscatter. In\nthe Doppler shift panels, velocities are\nonly shown where significant power is\nobserved. Grey backscatter indicates\nground backscatter, and negative ve-\nlocities represent Doppler shifts away\nfrom the radar along the line-of-sight.\nPoleward-moving radar auroral forms\n(PMRAFs) are indicated by arrows in\nthe upper (beam 1) power panel; re-\nlated events are observed in each of the\nother beams shown. Superimposed on\neach panel are the times identified in\nthe Cluster observations, as in Fig. 3,\nspecifically, the centre times of the four\nmagnetospheric FTEs, the entry into the\nboundary layer (BL), the three cross-\nings of the magnetopause (MP), and the\nfour magnetosheath FTEs.\ntion, either PIFs (Pinnock et al., 1995) or PMRAFs (Milan\net al., 2000), or both (Provan et al., 1998) can be observed\nby SuperDARN radars. In the present case, both are ob-\nserved. Two clear examples of PMRAFs are seen at 09:21\u2013\n09:26 UT and 09:41\u201309:45 UT in beams 1 to 3, marked by\nthe arrows in the upper panel. In these examples, a narrow\nregion of backscatter containing negative Doppler shifts is\nseen to progress poleward over a latitudinal range of \u223c 2\u25e6 in\nthe space of a few minutes. Examples of events which can\nbe identified as both PIFs and PMRAFs are seen between\n10:30 and 10:50 UT. Here, a continuous region of backscat-\nter is seen, but within this are several poleward-moving en-\nhancements in the backscatter power (see especially beam 1).\nSimultaneously, the Doppler shifts are modulated such that\nthe enhanced power features are associated with elevated\nDoppler shifts. In all, four such events are seen in this 20 min\ninterval. The middle two events form the high Doppler shift\nregion identified in Fig. 6c. These and other PMRAFs which\noccur during the interval are also marked by arrows in the\nupper panel of the figure.\nOver and above these PIFs and PMRAFs, the present ob-\nservations, in conjunction with the Cluster magnetopause\nmeasurements, allow us to gain new insight into the pro-\ncesses which give rise to these \u201ctraditional\u201d signatures of\nFTEs. The PIF\/PMRAF signatures are primarily identified\nin the higher latitude backscatter region, i.e. that region con-\ntaining high Doppler shifts. However, there is also evidence\nthat the backscatter power and velocity are modulated in the\nlower latitude ionospheric backscatter region corresponding\nto westward flow, and we recall from Fig. 6 that it is in this\nlower latitude region that the magnetically mapped Cluster\nfootprint lies. In association with the first, second, and fourth\nmagnetosphere FTEs identified in the Cluster measurements,\nthere appear to be enhancements in the power of this low-\nlatitude backscatter, especially in beam 2. These power en-\nhancements are seen to start at 09:45, 09:54, and 10:05 UT,\nand have a duration of approximately 5 min. Other simi-\nlar enhancements are observed at 10:14, 10:21, 10:32, and\n10:40 UT. In addition, the Doppler shifts within this region\nof backscatter also appear modulated, with increases in the\nvelocity corresponding to enhancements in power.\nThe velocity modulation is not wholly clear from the\ncolour scale employed in Fig. 7, so in the upper panel of\nFig. 8, we reproduce the velocity measurements of beam 3\non a more suitable scale, and compare them with the Cluster\ndata. Beam 3 has been chosen since this has the longest un-\nJ. A. Wild et al.: First simultaneous observations of flux transfer events at the high-latitude magnetopause 1503\nFigure 8\nFig. 8. The upper panel shows CUT-\nLASS Finland velocity data from beam\n3, in a similar format to Fig. 7, but with\na revised colour scale which reveals the\npulsing of the line-of-sight flow in the\nband of lower latitude scatter. The sec-\nond panel shows the mean velocity ob-\nserved in this band, averaged over the\nlatitude range located between the hor-\nizontal dashed lines in the upper panel\n(and given a positive value in this case,\nthough the flow is directed away from\nthe radar). The lower panel shows the\nBN field component observed by Clus-\nter 1, as in Fig. 3. The vertical dashed\nlines are as in Figs. 3 and 7.\nbroken series of measurements in the lower latitude backscat-\nter region. The second panel in Fig. 8 shows a time-series\nof the Doppler shift measurements from the lower latitude\nbackscatter region of this beam, averaged between the hor-\nizontal dashed lines in the top panel (\u223c 74.5\u25e6\u201376\u25e6 mag-\nnetic latitude). The line-of-sight flow is seen to be char-\nacteristically pulsed from \u223c 100 to \u223c 300 m\/s on 5\u201310 min\ntime scales, in approximate concert with the pulsing of the\nbackscatter power. The third panel in Fig. 8 reproduces the\nBN component of the Cluster magnetometer data, contain-\ning the principal FTE signatures, for purposes of detailed\ncomparison. It can be seen that enhancements in the ve-\nlocity occur in association with each of the four magneto-\nspheric FTEs, with peak values occurring typically 1\u20132 min\nafter what has been judged to be the \u201ccentre\u201d time of the\nCluster FTEs, shown by the vertical dashed lines. The rela-\ntive timing of such pulses for individual events will depend\nupon the relative propagation times from the reconnection\nsite over the magnetopause to the spacecraft, and along the\nfield to the ionosphere and from then on to the radar field-of-\nview. Each of these propagation times will typically be of the\norder of a few minutes (\u223c 1\u20135 min, say), such that\u223c 1\u20132 min\ndisplacements in either direction are not unexpected, depend-\ning upon the details. Flow enhancements are also observed\nfollowing the occurrence of large amplitude BN signatures\nin the boundary layer, in association with the final magne-\ntopause crossings (which also have spike-like BN signatures,\nas noted above), and in association with the magnetosheath\nFTEs, though we note that the velocity measurements at the\nlatter time are patchy and noisy.\nWe find, therefore, a compelling association between FTE\nsignatures observed at the magnetopause with enhancements\nin velocity and power observed in the backscatter echoes,\ncorresponding to the lower latitude westward flow region,\ni.e. flow that is consistent with the expected motion of re-\ncently reconnected flux tubes. This correspondence is good\ndespite the fact that these ground-based measurements are\nmade \u223c 2 h MLT to the west of the Cluster footprint. Unfor-\ntunately, we cannot make similar measurements directly con-\njugate with Cluster, since here the westward flow is nearly\nperpendicular to the radar beam look-directions (Fig. 2), and\nthus, no clear modulation of the line-of-sight velocity is ob-\nserved (see Fig. 9 below). However, we noted above that\nthese events and their ground-based signatures are, in gen-\neral, likely to be large in spatial scale, and our results confirm\nthis expectation. Some ground-based events do occur with-\nout a clear signature at the spacecraft, such as the PMRAFs\nobserved at \u223c 09:21 and \u223c 09:41 UT. However, the space-\ncraft was only approaching the boundary region during that\ninterval, and was presumably too far from the magnetopause\nto observe the related FTE signatures.\nThese observations thus suggest that the lower latitude\nwestward flow region observed here corresponds to newly-\nopened flux tubes in which the first influences of each burst\nof reconnection is felt. Therefore, it is of interest to con-\nsider the relationship between the flow and power enhance-\nments observed in this region with the PIF and PMRAF sig-\nnatures observed at higher latitudes. Examination of the data\nin Figs. 7 and 8 shows that these are closely related. The\nobservations in beam 2, for example, suggest that each en-\nhancement in backscatter power observed in the westward\nflow region between 10:05 and 10:45 UT precedes a PIF or\nPMRAF signature in the higher latitude backscatter. In other\nwords, the PIF\/PMRAF events originate near a latitude of\n74\u25e6\u201375\u25e6, mapping close to the latitude of the Cluster foot-\nprint, and propagating poleward close to the 80\u25e6 latitude\nwhere they resemble the more classic PIF\/PMRAF signa-\ntures. We note that a delay of a few minutes can be asso-\nciated with this poleward propagation. This association be-\ntween flow changes at lower latitudes and PMRAF features at\n1504 J. A.

The vertical lines show the same key times from the Cluster data as shown in the previous time-series plots.\nJ. A. Wild et al.: First simultaneous observations of flux transfer events at the high-latitude magnetopause 1505\nhigher latitudes was previously found in the study presented\nby Milan et al. (2000). Recent work suggests that the iono-\nspheric electron density is structured in response to changes\nin flow excited by transient reconnection (i.e. in the west-\nward flow region) and that these electron density structures\nthen propagate poleward, embedded within the background\nconvection flow. The electron density gradients associated\nwith these structures drive plasma instability processes which\nproduce ionospheric irregularities, the targets from which\nSuperDARN radars scatter (see, for instance, Milan et al.,\n1999a). Since the recombination rate in the F-region iono-\nsphere is low, these electron density gradients can persist for\nmany tens of minutes as they convect in the background flow.\nHowever, the instability growth rate is governed by the scale-\nlength and size of these gradients which, in turn, is controlled\nby the details of the structuring mechanism which first pro-\nduced them, i.e. significant backscatter may or may not be as-\nsociated with any particular event depending on exactly how\nthis structuring took place. These variations presumably ac-\ncount for the fact that some of the lower latitude pulses are\nassociated with PIF\/PMRAFs, while others are not. If ir-\nregularities are produced, however, they may well persist for\nlonger than they are observed by the radar, with the latter\ninterval controlled by instrumental factors, such as the max-\nimum range to which the radar illuminates the ionosphere.\nTherefore, PMRAFs are fossils of the ionospheric structur-\ning that takes place at the ionospheric footprint of the merg-\ning gap. The discrete nature of these fossils relates to the\nimpulsive nature of the flow-excitation process. These fos-\nsils thus provide an excellent tracer of the convection flow\non newly-reconnected field lines, excited by the reconnec-\ntion process poleward of the merging gap. Whether these\nfossils are associated with PIFs, i.e. is modulations in the\nionospheric flow, or not gives us a clue as to the level that oc-\ncurs of inductive smoothing of the flow, excited by the recon-\nnection process. One important repercussion of this picture\nis that the observation of a PMRAF may be delayed from\nits associated burst of reconnection by up to several min-\nutes. This is consistent with the observations in the present\ninterval. It is not clear from the observations what process\ngives rise to the enhancements in backscatter power seen in\nthe lower latitude backscatter, though we assume that these\nare directly related to bursts of reconnection occurring at the\nmagnetopause. The enhancements in the ionospheric elec-\ntron density through precipitation, driven by the reconnec-\ntion process, are one possible source. Such enhancements\nin the background electron density would give rise to an in-\ncrease in the irregularity scatter cross section which controls\nthe backscatter power.\n3.3 EISCAT Svalbard radar data\nThe observations discussed above suggest that during the in-\nterval investigated here, the ionosphere above Svalbard, con-\njugate to Cluster, was subject to impulsive flows and precip-\nitation associated with FTE-related bursts of magnetopause\nreconnection. Therefore, it is of interest to briefly exam-\nine the ionospheric structure which resulted from these pro-\ncesses. Fig. 9 thus shows ESR observations from 09:15 to\n11:15 UT (as in the previous diagrams). The upper panel\nalso illustrates line-of-sight irregularity drift velocity mea-\nsurements from beam 8 of the Finland radar as a function\nof magnetic latitude from 70\u25e6 to 87\u25e6 (see Fig. 2), shown\nfor purposes of comparison. As in previous figures, posi-\ntive and negative velocities represent motion of irregularities\ntoward and away from the radar, respectively, while returns\nattributed to ground scatter are indicated in grey. The sec-\nond panel presents line-of-sight ion velocity estimates at a\n128 s effective resolution from the low elevation northward-\ndirected ESR beam (azimuth 336\u25e6, elevation 30\u25e6). The di-\nrection of this beam lies close to that of the CUTLASS Fin-\nland beam 8, as can be seen in Fig. 2. These data are again\nshown as a function of magnetic latitude, but this time, be-\ntween 78\u25e6 and 82\u25e6; the observations cover the F-region al-\ntitude range between 200 and 530 km. The third and fourth\npanels present 2 min resolution observations of electron den-\nsity and ion temperature, respectively, from the field-aligned\nESR beam (azimuth 181\u25e6, elevation 81.6\u25e6), as a function of\naltitude from 100 to 700 km. It is salient to note that the field-\naligned beam corresponds to a magnetic latitude of around\n75\u25e6, and thus lies within the lower latitude region of scatter\nobserved by CUTLASS where the Cluster footprint is also\nfound. These observations correspond to range gate 37 of\nbeam 8 of the Finland field-of-view.\nIn conformity with the discussion relating to Fig. 6, the\ndata from beam 8 of the CUTLASS Finland radar exhibit\ntwo regions of ionospheric scatter, one centred near 75\u25e6, em-\nbedded within a wide region of ground scatter, and the other\nlocated at higher latitudes. Both of these regions of scat-\nter tend to migrate equatorward after 09:40 UT. The sense of\nflow determined from the low elevation ESR beam, shown in\nthe second panel, is consistent with the HF irregularity drift\nmeasurements where the latter are available. The ESR mea-\nsurements reveal plasma flow away from the radar at all lati-\ntudes until 09:45 UT, indicating a poleward component to the\nvelocity. Between 09:30 UT and 09:45 UT, however, these\npoleward flows become somewhat reduced. After 09:45 UT,\nthere is evidence of equatorward flows at the poleward edge\nof the radar beam. The region occupied by flow towards the\nradar tends to move equatorward until 10:40 UT, after which\ntime, it recedes poleward. The region of equatorward plasma\nflow is, however, interspersed with poleward flow. The flow\npattern does appear to be highly structured but, as indicated\nabove, there is no clear pulsing of this poleward component\nof the flow in synchronization with the Cluster FTEs, as ob-\nserved either in the Finland beam 8, or in the ESR data. We\nacknowledge, however, that the time resolution of the ESR\ndata (\u223c 2 min), and the quality of the Finland data in beam 8,\nrenders this statement somewhat less than definitive.\nAlthough the field-aligned ESR beam does not yield veloc-\nities orthogonal to the magnetic field, the F-region ion tem-\nperature has been found to be a very good indicator of the\nmagnitude of the ion velocity (e.g. Davies et al., 1997, 1999).\nThis is due to the fact that a relative velocity between the\n1506 J. A. Wild et al.: First simultaneous observations of flux transfer events at the high-latitude magnetopause\nions and the neutral atmosphere elevates the temperature of\nthe F-region ion population through the process of ion fric-\ntional heating. The F-region ion temperature observed by\nthe field-aligned ESR beam during this interval, shown in the\nfourth panel, reveals an enhanced, albeit highly variable, ion\nvelocity, particularly before 10:20 UT. The frictional heating\ncommenced at approximately 09:00 UT (shortly before the\nstart of the interval shown), coinciding approximately with\na transition in the sense of the magnetosheath field (mapped\nfrom ACE) from north to south, with the onset of variability\nin the magnetospheric field measured by Cluster, as previ-\nously mentioned above. It is worth noting that there is more\nintense frictional heating between 09:50 and 10:20 UT than\nis observed before 09:50 UT. The later interval corresponds\nto a time when the strongest poleward flows, admittedly ob-\nserved at higher latitudes, have subsided. This suggests the\npresence of enhanced azimuthal flows, especially between\n09:50 and 10:20 UT. This is, in fact, demonstrated by the\nbeam-swinging of the Finland radar data in the westward\nflow region, previously described, which confirms that the\nazimuthal velocity does indeed tend to increase in a west-\nward direction through the interval of 09:15 to 10:20 UT.\nThe interval of \u223c 09:50 to \u223c 10:20 UT also corresponds to\nthe one in which Cluster observed continuous reconnection-\nassociated phenomena adjacent to the magnetopause, includ-\ning FTEs and the structured boundary layer containing time-\ndependent reconnection-related signatures. This is confirmed\nby the vertical lines, similar to previous figures, which indi-\ncate the times of the principal signatures seen in the Cluster\nmagnetic field data. We also note that the decrease in the\nfrictional heating at\u223c 10:20 UT occurs in conjunction with a\ntemporary Cluster re-entry into the magnetosphere between\n10:22 and 10:33 UT, during which no clear reconnection sig-\nnatures were seen, though they were resumed outside in the\nsubsequent magnetosheath.\nThe enhanced ion velocities indicated by the ion fric-\ntional heating observed in the field-aligned beam between\n\u223c 09:00 and 10:20 UT are expected to be responsible for\nmuch of the structure observed in the F-region electron den-\nsity during that time, as shown in the third panel of Fig. 9.\nIt is well-known that the occurrence of high ion tempera-\ntures depletes the plasma through a combination of enhanced\nrecombination and the generation of plasma upflows (e.g.\nRodger et al., 1992). The high F-region electron densities\nthemselves are suggested to originate from collisional ioni-\nsation by precipitating low energy cusp particles. Similar to\nthe velocities themselves, this precipitation is highly struc-\ntured, as can be seen most clearly in the observations after\n10:20 UT, when the complicating effect of frictional heating\non plasma density is for the most part absent. Unfortunately,\nthe time resolution of these ESR observations are such that\nenhancements in the electron density cannot be directly re-\nlated to enhancements in the backscatter power observed by\nthe Finland radar. Overall, however, these ESR observations\nclearly demonstrate the complex variable plasma conditions\nto which pulsed magnetopause reconnection, and consequent\npulsed precipitation and flow, give rise in the conjugate cusp\nionosphere.\n4 Summary\nIn this paper, we have studied Cluster magnetic field data\nobserved during an outbound pass through the high-latitude\npost-noon magnetospheric boundary adjacent to the cusp,\nduring which the magnetic footprint of the spacecraft passed\ncentrally through the fields-of-view of the CUTLASS Super-\nDARN radars, across the location of the field-aligned beam\nof the EISCAT Svalbard radars, and just equatorward of the\nnorthward-pointing low-elevation beam of the latter system.\nDuring the traversal of the boundary region, the Cluster data\nshow the onset of long-period (a few minutes) magnetic dis-\nturbances in association with a southward turn of the IMF\n(determined from lagged upstream ACE magnetic field data).\nThese disturbances culminated in the observation of four\nclear magnetospheric FTEs adjacent to the magnetopause,\nseparated by an average period of \u223c 7 min, and a highly-\nstructured boundary layer of \u223c 8 min in duration which con-\ntained similar features. Furthermore, clear FTEs were ob-\nserved subsequently in the magnetosheath. The magneto-\nspheric FTEs were observed close to the location of, and in\nsimilar form to, the original \u201cflux erosion events\u201d observed in\nHEOS-2 data by Haerendel et al. (1978). We have shown that\nthe form of the field perturbations observed in these events,\nboth in terms of the sense of the bipolar signatures in the\nfield component normal to the magnetopause, and of the field\nshears observed in the plane of the magnetopause, are con-\nsistent with the observation of open flux tubes connected to\nthe northern ionosphere which were formed by pulsed recon-\nnection at the dusk magnetopause.\nExamination of the CUTLASS radar data from the con-\njugate ionosphere thus reveals the existence of a band of\nradar backscatter which spans the latitude of the magneti-\ncally mapped Cluster footprint, which we infer as the repre-\nsentation of the radar image of the cusp ionosphere located\njust poleward of the open-closed field line boundary. The\nflow within this band is found to be westward and pole-\nward, consistent with the BY positive polarity of the pre-\nvailing IMF. Furthermore, the flow within this band and the\nbackscatter radar power were also found to pulse in close\nsynchronization with the FTEs observed by Cluster. These\nflow and power pulses were thus observed to propagate pole-\nward within the CUTLASS radar f-o-v, forming classic \u201cpul-\nsed ionospheric flow\u201d and \u201cpoleward-moving radar auroral\nform\u201d signatures. The observations leave no doubt that the\nCluster and CUTLASS signatures were directly related, and\nprovide a direct demonstration of the input of momentum and\nenergy into the magnetosphere-ionosphere system, resulting\nfrom pulsed reconnection at the magnetopause, as originally\nenvisaged in the outline by Dungey (1961).\nThe EISCAT observations also reveal the existence of a\ncomplex varying and structured polar ionosphere, resulting\nfrom the various processes which are related to these events.\nSpecifically, while ionospheric densities will be elevated by\nJ. A. Wild et al.: First simultaneous observations of flux transfer events at the high-latitude magnetopause 1507\ncusp precipitation associated with the reconnection pulses,\nthey are also found to be suppressed by the enhanced flows\ninferred from the elevated ion temperatures observed (and\nfrom CUTLASS). These inter-linked and competing proces-\nses require further study to elucidate the overall response of\nthe polar ionosphere to such forcing.\nAcknowledgement.
