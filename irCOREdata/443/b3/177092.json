The type of fundoplication was left to the discretion of the surgeon. Main outcome measures: Participants completed a baseline reflux questionnaire, developed specifically for this study, containing a disease-specific outcome measure, the Short Form with 36 Items (SF-36), the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and the Beliefs about Medicines and Surgery questionnaires (BMQ\/BSQ).Postal questionnaires were completed at participant specific time intervals after joining the trial (equivalent to approximately 3 and 12 months after surgery).Intraoperative data were recorded by the surgeons and all other in-hospital data were collected by the research nurse. At the end of the study period, participants completed a discrete choice experiment questionnaire. Results: The randomised groups were well balanced at entry. Participants had been taking GORD medication for a median of 32 months; the mean age of participants was 46 years and 66% were men. Of 178 randomised to surgery, 111 (62%) actually had fundoplication.There was a mixture of clinical and personal reasons why some patients did not have surgery, sometimes Objectives: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness, costeffectiveness and safety of a policy of relatively early laparoscopic surgery compared with continued medical management amongst people with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) judged suitable for both policies. Design: Relative clinical effectiveness was assessed by a randomised trial (with parallel non-randomised preference groups) comparing a laparoscopic surgerybased policy with a continued medical management policy. The economic evaluation compared the costeffectiveness of the two management policies in order to identify the most efficient provision of future care and describe the resource impact that various policies for fundoplication would have on the NHS.Setting: A total of 21 hospitals throughout the UK with a local partnership between surgeon(s) and gastroenterologist(s) who shared the secondary care of patients with GORD.Participants: The 810 participants, who were identified retrospectively or prospectively via their participating clinicians, had both documented evidence of GORD (endoscopy and\/or manometry\/24-hour pH monitoring) and symptoms for longer than 12 months. In addition,the recruiting clinician(s) was clinically uncertain about which management policy was best.Intervention: Of the 810 eligible patients who consented to participate, 357 were recruited to the related to long waiting times. A total or partial wrap procedure was performed depending on surgeon preference. Complications were uncommon and there were no deaths associated with surgery. By the equivalent of 12 months after surgery, 38% in the randomised surgical group (14% amongst those who had surgery) were taking reflux medication compared with 90% in the randomised medical group. There were substantial differences (one-third to one-half standard deviation) favouring the randomised surgical group across the health status measures, the size depending on assumptions about the proportion that actually had fundoplication. These differences were the same or somewhat smaller than differences observed at 3 months. The lower the reflux score, the worse the symptoms at trial entry and the larger the benefit observed after surgery. The preference surgical group had the lowest reflux scores at baseline. These scores improved substantially after surgery, and by 12 months they were better than those in the preference medical group. The BMQ\/BSQ and discrete choice experiment did distinguish the preference groups from each other and from the randomised groups. The latter indicated that the risk of serious complications was the most important single attribute of a treatment option. A within trial cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that the surgery policy was more costly (mean \u00a32049) but also more effective [+0.088 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)]. The estimated incremental cost per QALY was \u00a319,000\u2013\u00a323,000, with a probability between 46% (when 62% received surgery) and 19% (when all received surgery) of cost-effectiveness at a threshold of \u00a320,000 per QALY. Modelling plausible longer-term scenarios (such as lifetime benefit after surgery) indicated a greater likelihood (74%) of costeffectiveness at a threshold of \u00a320,000, but applying a range of alternative scenarios indicated wide uncertainty.The expected value of perfect information was greatest for longer-term quality of life and proportions of surgical patients requiring medication.Conclusions: Amongst patients requiring long-term medication to control symptoms of GORD, surgical management significantly increases general and refluxspecific health-related quality of life measures, at least up to 12 months after surgery. Complications of surgery were rare. A surgical policy is, however, more costly than continued medical management. At a threshold of \u00a320,000 per QALY it may well be cost-effective, especially when putative longer-term benefits are taken into account, but this is uncertain.The more troublesome the symptoms, the greater the potential benefit from surgery. Uncertainty about cost-effectiveness would be greatly reduced by more reliable information about relative longer-term costs and benefits of surgical and medical policies. This could be through extended follow-up of the reflux trial cohorts or of other cohorts of fundoplication patients.Peer reviewedPublisher PD","downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":"National Institute for Health Research","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:aura.abdn.ac.uk:2164\/264<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2011-02-22T11:36:17Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2164_632<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2164_364<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2164_330<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2164_705<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2164_633<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2164_706<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nThe effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of minimal access surgery amongst people with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease \u2013 a UK collaborative study<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nGrant, Adrian Maxwell<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nWileman, Samantha Mary<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nRamsay, Craig R<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nBojke, Laura<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nSculpher, Mark J.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nKilonzo, Mary Mueni<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nVale, Luke David<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nFrancis, Jillian Joy<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nMowat, Ashley G.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nKrukowski, Zygmunt H.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nCampbell, Marion Kay<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nEpstein, David<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nMacran, Sue<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nHeading, Robert<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nThursz, Mark<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nRussell, Ian<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nREFLUX Trial Group<\/dc:creator><dc:contributor>\nUniversity of Aberdeen, School of Medicine & Dentistry, Division of Applied Health Sciences<\/dc:contributor><dc:subject>\nGastroesophageal Reflux<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\nRandomised Controlled Trial<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\nSurgical Procedures, Minimally Invasive<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\nRC Internal medicine<\/dc:subject><dc:description>\n*Corresponding author randomised arm of the trial (178 allocated to surgical management,179 allocated to continued, but optimised,medical management) and 453 recruited to the parallel non-randomised preference arm (261 chose surgical management, 192 chose to continue with best medical management).

It produces high-quality research information on the \neffectiveness, costs and broader impact of health technologies for those who use, manage and provide care \nin the NHS. \u2018Health technologies\u2019 are broadly defined as all interventions used to promote health, prevent \nand treat disease, and improve rehabilitation and long-term care.\nThe research findings from the HTA Programme directly influence decision-making bodies such as the \nNational Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the National Screening Committee \n(NSC). HTA findings also help to improve the quality of clinical practice in the NHS indirectly in that they \nform a key component of the \u2018National Knowledge Service\u2019.\nThe HTA Programme is needs led in that it fills gaps in the evidence needed by the NHS. There are three \nroutes to the start of projects.\nFirst is the commissioned route. Suggestions for research are actively sought from people working in the \nNHS, from the public and consumer groups and from professional bodies such as royal colleges and NHS \ntrusts. These suggestions are carefully prioritised by panels of independent experts (including NHS service \nusers). The HTA Programme then commissions the research by competitive tender.\nSecond, the HTA Programme provides grants for clinical trials for researchers who identify research \nquestions. These are assessed for importance to patients and the NHS, and scientific rigour.\nThird, through its Technology Assessment Report (TAR) call-off contract, the HTA Programme \ncommissions bespoke reports, principally for NICE, but also for other policy-makers. TARs bring together \nevidence on the value of specific technologies.\nSome HTA research projects, including TARs, may take only months, others need several years. They \ncan cost from as little as \u00a340,000 to over \u00a31 million, and may involve synthesising existing evidence, \nundertaking a trial, or other research collecting new data to answer a research problem.\nThe final reports from HTA projects are peer  reviewed by a number of independent expert referees \nbefore publication in the widely read journal series Health Technology Assessment.\nCriteria for inclusion in the HTA journal series\nReports are published in the HTA journal series if (1) they have resulted from work for the HTA \nProgramme, and (2) they are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the referees and \neditors.\nReviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed \u2018systematic\u2019 when the account of the search, appraisal \nand synthesis methods (to minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the replication \nof the review by others.\nThe research reported in this issue of the journal was commissioned by the HTA Programme as project \nnumber 97\/10\/03. The contractual start date was in June 2000. The draft report began editorial \nreview in November 2006 and was accepted for publication in April 2008. As the funder, by devising a \ncommissioning brief, the HTA Programme specified the research question and study design. The authors \nhave been wholly responsible for all data collection, analysis and interpretation, and for writing up their \nwork.

The type of fundoplication was left to the \ndiscretion of the surgeon.\nMain outcome measures: Participants completed a \nbaseline r e f l u x  questionnaire, developed specifically \nfor this study, containing a disease-specific outcome \nmeasure, the Short Form with 36 Items (SF-36), the \nEuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and the Beliefs about \nMedicines and Surgery questionnaires (BMQ\/BSQ). \nPostal questionnaires were completed at participant-\nspecific time intervals after joining the trial (equivalent \nto approximately 3 and 12 months after surgery). \nIntraoperative data were recorded by the surgeons and \nall other in-hospital data were collected by the research \nnurse. At the end of the study period, participants \ncompleted a discrete choice experiment questionnaire.\nResults: The randomised groups were well balanced at \nentry. Participants had been taking GORD medication \nfor a median of 32 months; the mean age of participants \nwas 46 years and 66% were men. Of 178 randomised \nto surgery, 111 (62%) actually had fundoplication. \nThere was a mixture of clinical and personal reasons \nwhy some patients did not have surgery, sometimes \nObjectives: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness, cost-\neffectiveness and safety of a policy of relatively early \nlaparoscopic surgery compared with continued medical \nmanagement amongst people with gastro-oesophageal \nreflux disease (GORD) judged suitable for both policies.\nDesign: Relative clinical effectiveness was assessed \nby a randomised trial (with parallel non-randomised \npreference groups) comparing a laparoscopic surgery-\nbased policy with a continued medical management \npolicy. The economic evaluation compared the cost-\neffectiveness of the two management policies in order \nto identify the most efficient provision of future care and \ndescribe the resource impact that various policies for \nfundoplication would have on the NHS.\nSetting: A total of 21 hospitals throughout the UK \nwith a local partnership between surgeon(s) and \ngastroenterologist(s) who shared the secondary care of \npatients with GORD.\nParticipants: The 810 participants, who were identified \nretrospectively or prospectively via their participating \nclinicians, had both documented evidence of GORD \n(endoscopy and\/or manometry\/24-hour pH monitoring) \nand symptoms for longer than 12 months. In addition, \nthe recruiting clinician(s) was clinically uncertain about \nwhich management policy was best.\nIntervention: Of the 810 eligible patients who \nconsented to participate, 357 were recruited to the Abstract\niv\nrelated to long waiting times. A total or partial wrap \nprocedure was performed depending on surgeon \npreference. Complications were uncommon and \nthere were no deaths associated with surgery. By the \nequivalent of 12 months after surgery, 38% in the \nrandomised surgical group (14% amongst those who \nhad surgery) were taking reflux medication compared \nwith 90% in the randomised medical group. There \nwere substantial differences (one-third to one-half \nstandard deviation) favouring the randomised surgical \ngroup across the health status measures, the size \ndepending on assumptions about the proportion that \nactually had fundoplication. These differences were the \nsame or somewhat smaller than differences observed \nat 3 months. The lower the r e f l u x  score, the worse \nthe symptoms at trial entry and the larger the benefit \nobserved after surgery. The preference surgical group \nhad the lowest r e f l u x  scores at baseline. These scores \nimproved substantially after surgery, and by 12 months \nthey were better than those in the preference medical \ngroup. The BMQ\/BSQ and discrete choice experiment \ndid distinguish the preference groups from each other \nand from the randomised groups. The latter indicated \nthat the risk of serious complications was the most \nimportant single attribute of a treatment option. A \nwithin-trial cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that \nthe surgery policy was more costly (mean \u00a32049) \nbut also more effective [+0.088 quality-adjusted \nlife-years (QALYs)]. The estimated incremental cost \nper QALY was \u00a319,000\u2013\u00a323,000, with a probability \nbetween 46% (when 62% received surgery) and 19% \n(when all received surgery) of cost-effectiveness at a \nthreshold of \u00a320,000 per QALY. Modelling plausible \nlonger-term scenarios (such as lifetime benefit after \nsurgery) indicated a greater likelihood (74%) of cost-\neffectiveness at a threshold of \u00a320,000, but applying a \nrange of alternative scenarios indicated wide uncertainty. \nThe expected value of perfect information was greatest \nfor longer-term quality of life and proportions of surgical \npatients requiring medication.\nConclusions: Amongst patients requiring long-term \nmedication to control symptoms of GORD, surgical \nmanagement significantly increases general and reflux-\nspecific health-related quality of life measures, at \nleast up to 12 months after surgery. Complications \nof surgery were rare. A surgical policy is, however, \nmore costly than continued medical management. \nAt a threshold of \u00a320,000 per QALY it may well be \ncost-effective, especially when putative longer-term \nbenefits are taken into account, but this is uncertain. \nThe more troublesome the symptoms, the greater \nthe potential benefit from surgery. Uncertainty about \ncost-effectiveness would be greatly reduced by more \nreliable information about relative longer-term costs and \nbenefits of surgical and medical policies. This could be \nthrough extended follow-up of the r e f l u x  trial cohorts \nor of other cohorts of fundoplication patients.\nTrial registration: Current Controlled Trials \nISRCTN15517081.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

In addition, \nthe recruiting clinician(s) was clinically uncertain \nabout which management policy was best.\nIntervention\nOf the 810 eligible patients who consented to \nparticipate, 357 were recruited to the randomised \narm of the trial (178 allocated to surgical \nmanagement, 179 allocated to continued, but \noptimised, medical management) and 453 \nwere recruited to the parallel non-randomised \npreference arm (261 chose surgical management, \n192 chose to continue with best medical \nmanagement). The type of fundoplication was left \nto the discretion of the surgeon.\nMain outcome measures\nParticipants completed a baseline questionnaire \ncontaining a disease-specific outcome measure \n(the R e f l u x  questionnaire, developed specifically \nfor this study), the Short Form with 36 Items (SF-\n36), the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and the \nBeliefs about Medicines and Surgery questionnaires \n(BMQ\/BSQ). Postal questionnaires were completed \nat participant-specific time intervals after joining \nthe trial (these were at times equivalent to \napproximately 3 and 12 months after surgery). \nIntraoperative data were recorded by the surgeons \nand all other in-hospital data were collected by \nlocal research nurses. At the end of the study \nperiod, participants completed a discrete choice \nexperiment questionnaire.\nResults\nThe randomised groups were well balanced \nat entry. Participants had been taking GORD \nmedication for a median of 32 months; the mean \nage of participants was 46 years and 66% were \nmen. Of 178 randomised to surgery, 111 (62%) \nactually had fundoplication. There was a mixture \nof clinical and personal reasons why some patients \ndid not have surgery, sometimes related to long \nwaiting times. A total or partial wrap procedure \nwas performed, depending on surgeon preference. \nComplications were uncommon and there were no \ndeaths associated with surgery.\nExecutive summaryExecutive summary\nx\nBy the equivalent of 12 months after surgery, \n38% in the randomised surgical group (14% \namongst those who had surgery) were taking reflux \nmedication compared with 90% in the randomised \nmedical group. There were substantial differences \n[one-third to one-half standard deviation (SD)] \nfavouring the randomised surgical group across \nthe health status measures, the size depending on \nassumptions about the proportion that actually had \nfundoplication. These differences were the same or \nsomewhat smaller than differences observed at 3 \nmonths. The lower the R e f l u x  score the worse the \nsymptoms at trial entry and the larger the benefit \nobserved after surgery.\nThe preference surgical group had the lowest \nR e f l u x  scores at baseline. These scores improved \nsubstantially after surgery and by 12 months \nthey were better than those in the preference \nmedical group. The BMQ\/BSQ and discrete \nchoice experiment did distinguish the preference \ngroups from each other and from the randomised \ngroups. The latter indicated that the risk of serious \ncomplications was the most important single \nattribute of a treatment option.\nA within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis suggested \nthat the surgery policy was more costly (mean \n\u00a32049) but also more effective [+0.088 quality-\nadjusted life-years (QALYs)]. The estimated \nincremental cost per QALY was \u00a319,000\u2013\u00a323,000, \nwith a probability between 46% (when 62% \nreceived surgery) and 19% (when all received  \nsurgery) of cost-effectiveness at a threshold of \n\u00a320,000 per QALY. Modelling plausible longer-\nterm scenarios (such as lifetime benefit after \nsurgery) indicated a greater likelihood (74%) of \ncost-effectiveness at a threshold of \u00a320,000, but \napplying a range of alternative scenarios indicated \nwide uncertainty. The expected value of perfect \ninformation was greatest for longer-term quality of \nlife and proportions of surgical patients requiring \nmedication.\nConclusions\nAmongst patients requiring long-term medication \nto control symptoms of GORD, surgical \nmanagement significantly increases general \nand reflux-specific health-related quality of life \nmeasures, at least up to 12 months after surgery. \nComplications of surgery were rare. A surgical \npolicy is, however, more costly than continued \nmedical management. At a threshold of \u00a320,000 \nper QALY it may well be cost-effective, especially \nwhen putative longer-term benefits are taken into \naccount, but this is uncertain. \nImplications for health care\nExtending the use of laparoscopic fundoplication \nto people whose GORD symptoms require long-\nterm medication would provide health gain. \nHowever, it is more costly and so judgements \nare required about cost-effectiveness. The more \ntroublesome the symptoms, the greater the \npotential benefit from surgery.\nRecommendations for research\nUncertainty about cost-effectiveness would be \ngreatly reduced by more reliable information about \nrelative longer-term costs and benefits of surgical \nand medical policies. This could be through \nextended follow-up of the R e f l u x  trial cohorts or of \nother cohorts of fundoplication patients.\nTrial registration\nThis trial is registered as ISRCTN15517081.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

This report describes the \nwork commissioned to address this issue.\nGastro-oesophageal \nreflux disease\nGORD causes some of the most frequently seen \nsymptoms in both primary and secondary care; \nbetween 20% and 30% of a \u2018Western\u2019 adult \npopulation experience heartburn and\/or reflux \nintermittently.1\u20133 There is a clinical spectrum. The \nmajority has only mild symptoms and requires little \nif any medication. A minority has severe reflux \nand develops overt complications, despite full \nmedical therapy, and requires surgical intervention. \nAmongst the remainder, control of symptoms \nrequires regular or continuous medical therapy, \nand it is from this intermediate group of patients \nwith significant disease that most of the treatment \ncosts for the health service arise.\nTreatment of GORD includes a range of options, \nboth medical and surgical. The simplest is self-\nadministered antacids with advice to alter lifestyle \nfactors such as dietary modification, smoking \ncessation and weight reduction. Many will require \nacid suppression therapy using either histamine \nreceptor antagonists (H2RAs) or proton pump \ninhibitors (PPIs). Initial high-dose therapy may \nbe followed by maintenance treatment using these \ndrugs either intermittently or continuously at \nreduced doses sufficient to suppress symptoms. \nThe role of surgery has traditionally been confined \nto the treatment of those with severe symptoms not \nresponding to medication in appropriate dosage \nand medically fit for surgery. There has, however, \nbeen a paradigm shift since the introduction of \nlaparoscopic techniques, with surgery suggested as \nan alternative treatment to long-term medication. \nThe NHS costs of GORD are considerable. The \nyearly drug budget for H2RAs is in excess of \u00a3200M \nand for PPIs it is \u00a3300M. Of this budget, most of \nthis prescribing occurs within the primary care \nsetting.4,5 Once started on PPIs, the majority of \npatients with significant GORD remain on long-\nterm treatment,6 and an estimated 4\u20135 patients \n(age 18\u201360) per 10,000 are taking maintenance \nPPIs for oesophagitis and reflux. \nAlthough PPIs are increasingly assumed to be \nsafe there is a spectrum of short-term symptoms \ncaused by PPIs7 and there are concerns regarding \nthe impact of long-term use through profound \nacid suppression. PPIs cause hypergastrinaemia, \nthe long-term significance of which is unknown \nbut potentially important. Conditions associated \nwith chronic hypergastrinaemia and low acid \nlevels have been linked to a long-term increased \nrisk of developing gastric cancer. There is some \nevidence of the formation of gastric carcinoid \ntumours in patients taking long-term PPIs8 and \nalso of vitamin B12 deficiency.9 Adenocarcinoma \nof the lower oesophagus is a complication of \nlong-term GORD,10\u201313 and the incidence of this \nhighly malignant disease has trebled in Western \ncommunities in the last 25 years. Whilst the \noverall incidence of gastric cancer is falling, \nadenocarcinoma of the gastro-oesophageal junction \nis now a common cause of death, especially in \nmen. The reasons for this change are probably \nmultifactorial, but there is a clear relationship \nbetween Helicobacter pylori infection with migration \nto the gastric fundus and acid suppression, whether \nnaturally occurring or induced by drug therapy.14,15\nLaparoscopic fundoplication\nInterest in surgery as an alternative to long-term \nmedical therapy for GORD has been considerable \nsince the introduction of the minimal access \napproach in the early 1990s. The operative \nmethod, whether using an open or a laparoscopic \napproach, involves performing a fundoplication \nby wrapping the fundus of the stomach around \nthe lower oesophagus to create a high-pressure \nzone, thus reducing gastro-oesophageal reflux. \nThe wrap created can be either complete (360\u00b0) \nor partial. Many operative variants have been \ndescribed. The commonest operation is a 1-cm \ncomplete wrap fashioned over a large bougie, \nthe so-called \u2018short floppy Nissen\u2019.16,17 The use \nof a partial fundoplication has a number of \npotential advantages but several controlled studies \nhave shown broad equivalence between the two \nChapter 1  \nIntroductionIntroduction\n2\napproaches.18,19 For the purpose of this study they \nare therefore regarded as equivalent. Although \nfundoplication will produce resolution of reflux \nsymptoms in upwards of 90% of patients, there is \ncontinuing debate regarding the risks, side effects \nand durability of surgical therapy. \nMedical management\nThere is no doubt that PPIs, sometimes combined \nwith prokinetic agents, are the most effective \ntreatment for moderate to severe GORD. For \nthe purpose of this study, medical therapy has \nbeen taken to mean long-term therapy with \nPPIs (or H2RAs if intolerant to PPIs). Although \nfundoplication is highly effective for controlling \nGORD, there has been considerable uncertainty \nwhether exchanging symptoms associated with \nthe best medical management of GORD for those \nof the side effects of surgery is advantageous for \nthe patient and cost-effective for the health-care \nprovider. \nThe costs of laparoscopic fundoplication appear to \nbe equivalent to those of 2\u20133 years of maintenance \ntreatment with PPIs, although it is acknowledged \nthat the costs of PPIs are falling.20 The costs of \nsurgery are related largely to two factors \u2013 the \nincidence of complications\/length of hospital stay \nand the number of patients requiring long-term \nmedical interventions after surgery.\nRationale for the \nstudy design\nThe study described in this report aimed to clarify \nthe place of laparoscopic fundoplication in the \nbelief that decisions about the management of \nGORD should be based on unbiased, statistically \nprecise comparisons of alternative policies. All \npatients in this study fulfilled three criteria: they \nwere on long-term acid suppression with PPIs; they \nhad symptoms that were thought to be adequately \ncontrolled; and they  were suitable in terms of \nfitness and co-morbidity for either surgical or \ncontinuing medical treatment for their GORD.\nThe most likely sources of bias were in the ways in \nwhich the groups being compared were selected, \nthe ways in which their outcomes were assessed, \nand how the management was actually delivered. \nThis is the basis for using a pragmatic randomised \ncontrolled trial design. Random allocation protects \nagainst selection bias. Confining the trial to \nthose with no clear treatment preference limits \nbiased patient-centred assessment of outcome, \nand pragmatic comparison of alternative policies \n(with intention to treat analysis) avoids bias \nintroduced by non-compliance. This approach \nhas limitations, however, and for this reason we \nchose to incorporate two parallel, non-randomised \npreference groups. \nExcluding those with a clear preference for one \npolicy or the other limits extrapolation and \ngeneralisation. Study of this group may give \ninsights into the reasons for preference and \nhence give pointers to patient choices after the \nstudy.21 Furthermore, preference may influence \noutcome and, if so, this may also help when \nmaking treatment decisions.21,22 A third reason for \nincluding the parallel, non-randomised preference \ngroups23 is that the addition of data from the \npreference groups may reduce imprecision around \nthe estimates from the randomised comparison and \nthis may be particularly useful for rare events, such \nas complications, that can be confidently ascribed \nto one or other treatment. (The limitation is that \nthese groups are not derived by random allocation \nand hence the comparisons are prone to the biases \nof non-randomised studies.)\nThe decisions about, and comparisons between, \nrandomised and preference groups require valid \nmeasurement of treatment outcome. Although \nthere are a number of quality of life tools available, \nnone was sufficiently specific to assess the spectrum \nof gastrointestinal symptoms associated with the \ntreatment of GORD, particularly surgery. For this \nreason the development and validation of a new \noutcome measure (the R e f l u x  questionnaire; see \nChapter 4) was an essential component of the \nstudy.24 \nGORD and its management represent a very \nsignificant call on NHS resources. Although \nclinical effectiveness, acceptability and safety will \nbe important determinants of future policy, the \nissues of cost and resource use may be over-riding. \nA prospective, multicentre study25 found that the \ntotal cost for chronic PPI (omeprazole) therapy \nover 5 years was less than the cost of an open \nfundoplication; however, two other studies26,27 \nfound laparoscopic surgery to be less expensive in \nthe long run than daily treatment with 20\u201340 mg of \nomeprazole. In one of these studies27 laparoscopic \nfundoplication became more cost-effective at 1.4 \nyears post procedure. A Canadian Markov model \ncomparing medical management with laparoscopic \nfundoplication concluded that laparoscopic Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008. All rights reserved.\n3\nfundoplication became cost-effective at 3.3 years \npost operation.28 \nA recent UK trial-based economic analysis \ncomparing laparoscopic fundoplication with PPIs \nusing data on 100 GORD patients29 reported \nthat the incremental cost per point improvement \nin combined gastrointestinal and psychological \nwell-being scores at 12 months for laparoscopic \nfundoplication versus PPI was \u00a3293, and the \nincremental cost per additional patient returned \nto a physiologically normal acid score at 3 months \nwas \u00a35515.29 There are, however, no existing \nstudies in the UK that have compared laparoscopic \nfundoplication with PPIs using a generic measure \nof health, such as quality-adjusted life-years \n(QALYs). Expressing health benefits in terms of \nQALYs would provide decision-makers with a \nbasis for comparison with other uses of health-\ncare resources in a range of disease areas and \nspecialties. \nThere is little doubt that PPIs are the most effective \npharmacotherapy30 for moderate to severe GORD \nand, for the purpose of this analysis, medical \ntherapy will be taken to mean long-term therapy \nwith PPIs. Although fundoplication is a highly \neffective therapy for controlling GORD, the \nquestion is whether surgery, which can alleviate \nGORD symptoms but may have unwanted side \neffects, is advantageous for the patient and cost-\neffective for the health-care provider.\nThis is the reason for the economic evaluation. \nPolicy should be guided by both assessment of the \nrelative cost-effectiveness of alternative policies \nand assessment of the impact that possible policy \nchanges would have for the NHS and for patients \nwith GORD.

The participating clinician reviewed each \npatient\u2019s symptoms and treatment regimen and \nassessed eligibility (see Appendix 4).\nEligible patients were those for whom care had \nbeen provided by a participating clinician who \nwas uncertain which management policy (surgical \nor medical) was better. In addition, patients had \nto have documented evidence of GORD (based \non endoscopy and\/or manometry\/24-hour pH \nmonitoring) as well as symptoms for more than \n12 months requiring maintenance PPI therapy for \nreasonable symptom control. Patients who were \nintolerant to PPIs and who therefore required \nH2RA therapy to control their symptoms were \nalso included. Patients who were morbidly obese \n[body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg\/m2], patients \nwith Barrett\u2019s oesophagus of more than 3 cm or \nwho had evidence of dysplasia, patients who had \na para-oesophageal hernia and patients with an \noesophageal stricture were all excluded.\nIf eligibility was confirmed the patient was invited \nto see the local research nurse who described the \ntrial, giving supplementary information describing \nthe operation (see Appendix 5) and answering any \nquestions or concerns. This process is summarised \nin Figure 1.\nConsent to participate\nThe randomised trial\nSome potential participants made a decision \nabout participation at this appointment. Those \nwho wished to participate in the randomised trial \nwere asked to sign a consent form (see Appendix \n6). On this, they confirmed that they had been \ngiven the information they required and that the \nstudy had been explained to them. They also \nconfirmed that they understood that they would \nbe sent questionnaires at participant-specific time \nintervals after joining the study (this would be \nat times equivalent to around 3 months and 12 \nStudy design\nThe study had two complementary components:\n a multicentre, pragmatic randomised trial  (a) \n(with parallel non-randomised preference \ngroups) comparing a laparoscopic surgery-\nbased policy with a continued medical \nmanagement policy to assess their relative \nclinical effectiveness\n an economic evaluation of laparoscopic  (b) \nsurgery for GORD comparing the cost-\neffectiveness of the two management policies \nto identify the most efficient provision of \nfuture care and describe the resource impact \nthat various policies for fundoplication would \nhave on the NHS.\nPatients who consented to participate in the \nrandomised trial were randomly allocated to \neither laparoscopic surgery or continued medical \nmanagement. Those patients who had a strong \npreference for one or other of the two treatment \noptions could be recruited to the preference \nstudy. Clinical history at trial entry was recorded \non participants\u2019 entry forms (see Appendix 1). \nParticipants completed health status questionnaires \nat the time of recruitment to the study and then at \nspecified times equivalent to 3 and 12 months after \nsurgery (see Appendix 2).\nApproval for this study was obtained from the \nScottish Multicentre Research Ethics Committee \nand the appropriate local research ethics \ncommittees.\nClinical centres\nClinical centres were based on local partnerships \nbetween surgeons with experience of laparoscopic \nfundoplication and the gastroenterologists with \nwhom they shared the secondary care of patients \nwith GORD. Centres were eligible if they included: \na surgeon who had performed at least 50  1. \nlaparoscopic fundoplication operations\none or more gastroenterologists who agreed to  2. \ncollaborate with the surgeon(s) in the trial.Methods\n6\nmonths after surgery). They were also told that it \nwas anticipated that further follow-up would be \nperformed periodically thereafter for some years.\nThe preference study\nA person who did not want to take part in the \nrandomised trial because of a strong preference \nfor one type of treatment management or the \nother was asked to take part in the preference \narm of the study. Those who wished to participate \nin the preference study were given a preference \ninformation leaflet and asked to sign a consent \nform (see Appendix 7) confirming their preferred \ntreatment allocation.

It was recommended that crural repair \nbe routine and that non-absorbable, synthetic \nsutures (not silk) be used for the repair. The type \nof fundoplication used was left to the discretion of \nthe experienced surgeon. For the purposes of the \nmain comparisons, the different surgical techniques \nfor laparoscopic fundoplication were considered \nas part of a single policy. The study design, \nhowever, allowed for indirect comparisons between \ntechniques.\nMedical therapy policy\nThose allocated to the medical therapy policy \nhad their therapy reviewed and adjusted as \nnecessary by the local gastroenterologist to be \u2018best \nmedical management\u2019. It was recommended that \nmanagement conformed to the principles of the \nGenval Workshop Report.31 These include stepping \ndown anti-secretory medication in most patients to \nthe lowest dose that maintains acceptable symptom \ncontrol. However, patients with severe oesophagitis \nwere not managed on the basis of symptoms alone. \nAlthough trial participants allocated to medical \nmanagement were managed in this way, the \nprotocol did include the option of surgery if a clear \nindication for it subsequently developed.\nStudy registration (and \ntreatment allocation \nwhen randomised)\nThe entry procedure distinguished between those \nwho agreed to randomisation and those who \nagreed to participate in the preference part of the \nstudy. \nOnce a participant had agreed to join the trial \nthe research nurse recorded basic identifying and \ndescriptive information on a standard form (see \nAppendix 1). A letter was sent to each participant, \nconfirming their participation and whether they \nwere taking part in the randomised or preference \ncomponent of the trial. At this point the participant \nwas also asked to complete a baseline questionnaire \n(see Appendix 2). \nThe treatment allocation for participants in the \nrandomised component of the trial was computer \ngenerated in the trial office; it was stratified \nby centre, with balance in respect of other key \nprognostic variables \u2013 age (18\u201349 years or 50+ \nyears), sex (male or female) and BMI (\u2264 28 or \n> 29 kg\/m2) \u2013 by a process of minimisation. \nRandomisation was organised centrally at the \nHealth Services Research Unit, Aberdeen, and was \nindependent of all clinical collaborators. \nClinical management\nThe first 146 randomised participants (70 allocated \nsurgery and 76 allocated medical management) \nwere sent details of their allocation at the same \ntime as the baseline questionnaires. This was \nchanged for subsequent participants at the request \nof the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC; see page \n10 ) such that the allocation was only generated \nonce completed baseline forms had been returned. \nThis was to ensure that there was no possibility \nthat knowledge of the allocation might influence \nresponses to the baseline questionnaire (as well as \nensuring that a completed baseline questionnaire \nwould be received from all randomised \nparticipants). A summary of the trial procedure \npathways is illustrated in Figure 2.\nParticipants who were allocated to the surgical \narm were invited to a consultation with the \ncollaborating surgeon. During this consultation \nthe surgeon confirmed that there were no Methods\n8\ncontraindications to surgery and discussed the \noperation in more detail, before arranging an \noperation date. The intraoperative details were \nrecorded by the surgeon on specially designed \nstudy forms (see Appendix 8). All other in-hospital \ndata collection was the responsibility of the local \nresearch nurse. In all respects, other than the trial \ninterventions, clinical management was left to the \ndiscretion of the clinician responsible for care. \nData collection\nFollow-up by postal questionnaire was performed \nat least twice at participant-specific time intervals \nafter joining the study. This was around 3 and \n12 months after surgery or at an equivalent time \namongst those who did not have surgery.

The cost savings of a surgical \npolicy largely depend on the number of patients \nmanaged surgically who no longer require PPI \ntreatment, and a trial with 300 surgically managed \npatients would have estimated this proportion to \nwithin about 5% with 95% statistical confidence.\nHowever, prompted by a lower rate of recruitment \nthan expected, this target was revised in \nJanuary 2003 in consultation with the DMC and \nrepresentatives of the HTA programme. It was \nagreed that a larger benefit (0.3 of a standard \ndeviation) was clinically plausible based on \nimprovements seen after surgery amongst more \nseverely affected people. This was calculated to \nrequire 196 in each group to give 80% power \n(p = 0.05). On this basis it was agreed that \nrecruitment would be extended for an extra year, \naiming for this revised sample size. \nStatistical analysis\nA single principal analysis of the randomised \ntrial was planned when all participants had been \nfollowed up for 12 months after surgery (or an \nequivalent time if managed medically). The \nprimary outcome measure [R e f l u x  quality of life \n(QoL) score at 12 months] and secondary outcome \nmeasures (R e f l u x  QoL score at 3 months; SF-36, \nEQ-5D, R e f l u x  symptom scores and use of reflux-\nrelated drugs at 3 months and 12 months) were \nanalysed using general linear models that always \nadjusted for the minimisation covariates (age, \nBMI and sex) and where appropriate (defined \nby significant at the 5% significance level) also \nadjusted for baseline score and baseline score by \ntreatment interaction. A secondary, pre-stated, \nsubgroup analysis explored the differential effects \nof surgeons\u2019 preferred operative procedures on the \nprimary outcome measure. All analyses used 95% \nconfidence intervals. \nThe primary analysis of the randomised trial \nwas by intention to treat. The intention to \ntreat approach gives the least biased estimate \nof effectiveness of the two interventions. As a \nsecondary comparison we were also interested in \nestimating the efficacy of the treatment received. \nGiven that a relatively large proportion of the \nrandomised surgical participants did not receive \nsurgery, we used two approaches to estimate the \nefficacy of the treatment \u2013 a per protocol analysis \nand an adjusted treatment received analysis.32 \nIn the per protocol analysis, participants who \nwere randomised to surgery and actually received Methods\n10\nsurgery were compared with participants who were \nrandomised to medication and actually received \nmedication (i.e. the compliers in the surgical group \nwere compared with the compliers in the medical \ngroup). In an open trial design the per protocol \nestimate can have substantial selection bias. One \nway to estimate the effect when the allocation was \ncomplied with while adjusting for possible selection \nbiases is to use a latent variable approach.33 We \nused the method of adjusted treatment received as \ndescribed by Nagelkerke et al.32 The method used a \ntwo-stage least squares approach whereby treatment \nrandomised was regressed onto treatment received \nand the residuals from that model were used as an \nindependent variable in a second model together \nwith the treatment received to estimate the effects \non the various primary and secondary outcome \nmeasures.\nFor the preference group, only the primary \noutcome was analysed statistically. The analysis \ncompared the preference surgical group with \nthe preference medical group and adjusted for \nthe minimisation factors. As described above, \nfor logistical reasons and to maintain balance \nbetween the randomised and preference groups, \nwe capped the number of preference participants \nat 20 per group per centre. The study design was \nnot therefore a true comprehensive cohort. We \ndid consider modelling differences between the \nrandomised and preference groups; however, it \nis not universally accepted that formal modelling \nis appropriate in this context. In this case we \nknew from the randomised arms that there was a \nstrong interaction with baseline reflux QoL, and \nin addition we also knew that there was a large \ndifference in QoL between preference arms at \nbaseline (and patient demographics). We therefore \ndecided that formal modelling of the arms would \nnot add much to the comparison given the large \nconfounding between preference groups. \nMissing items in the health-related outcome \nmeasures were treated as per the instructions for \nthat particular measure. No further imputation for \nmissing values was undertaken.\nData monitoring\nIn March 2003 an independent DMC met for \nthe first time to review the overall conduct of \nthe trial, patient accrual, data collection and an \ninterim analysis of the data. They considered data \navailable to them up to January 2003. At that \ntime 146 participants had been recruited to the \nrandomised trial, 76 allocated to the randomised \nmedical group and 70 allocated to the randomised \nsurgical group. Of the 177 preference participants, \n77 chose the medical group and 100 chose the \nsurgical group. On the basis of the data available to \nthem they requested that the treatment allocation \nprocedure be investigated. This led the DMC to \ninstruct that the entry procedures be amended (as \ndescribed on page 7) so that participants were only \nrandomised once the trial office had received the \nbaseline questionnaire and all of the other baseline \npaperwork (see Appendices 2, 4, and 6). \nThe DMC met on two further occasions (July \n2003, January 2004) and were happy with the trial \nprogress and interim analyses and saw no reason to \nrecommend any further changes to the protocol.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

Using the best \nevidence then available we developed a decision \nanalytic model to provide preliminary estimates \nof costs and outcomes for medical and surgical \nmanagement prior to the R e f l u x  trial reporting.34,35 \nThis chapter describes the preliminary economic \nmodel. \nMethods\nDescription of the model\nThe model was probabilistic and took the \nperspective of the UK NHS. Health outcomes \nwere expressed in terms of QALYs with a lifetime \nhorizon. The model related to a 45-year-old \npatient as this is the peak age of presentation with \nGORD.36 There proved to be very little difference \nbetween men and women; thus, only the results for \nmales are presented here. Costs and QALYs have \nbeen discounted at a rate of 3.5% per annum.37 \nThe structure of the model can be seen in Figure 3. \nTwo strategies were compared: long-term medical \nmanagement and immediate laparoscopic surgery \nfor GORD. Medical management was assumed \nto be prescribed for the remainder of a patient\u2019s \nlifetime (30 years for a 45-year-old patient). \nSurgery was assumed to occur immediately \nfollowing entry into the surgical arm of the model. \nThe model was also split into short-term and long-\nterm elements. The short-term model related to \nthe period immediately following allocation to \nsurgery or medical management. The longer-term \nelement tracked the patient\u2019s progression through \na series of states over the remainder of their \nlifetime. Patients were assumed to stay in a \u2018wait\u2019 \nstate before surgery, during which they would have \nreceived a maintenance dose of PPIs. The effects \nof alternative waiting times for surgery were also \nexplored using alternative scenarios (1 month and \n1 year) to represent the possible length of delay. \nIn these cases it was still assumed that surgery \nfollowing relapse would occur immediately, \nthat is there would be no delay. Monthly cycles \nrepresented the monthly transition probabilities \nbetween states in the model.\nFor patients receiving surgery a small mortality \nrisk is associated with laparoscopic fundoplication \n(approximately 5 per 10,000 patients)38\u201347 and this \nwas included in the model. If patients survived \nsurgery the outcomes could be success (cured) or \nfailure (relapse). In addition, patients could relapse \nfrom a successful surgery each month. This rate \nwas constant and lasted for only one cycle, during \nwhich a patient received a double dose of PPI. \nA scenario is also presented in which the risk of \nfailure from surgery (and the need for revision) \nended at 5 years after initial surgery. Patients could \nbe given a reoperation following surgery failure. If \nthe reoperation failed, surgery was deemed a total \nfailure and patients were considered to have been \nprescribed long-term medical management with \nPPIs. For patients offered medical management \nfollowing initial surgical failure, medical \nmanagement was deemed a total failure if there was \nsubsequent relapse from medical management, and \npatients were placed on a double dose of PPIs for \nthe remainder of their lives.\nMedical management patients had a risk of \nrelapsing each month. They could be offered \nsurgery or could receive a double dose of PPIs \nfor a cycle, followed by a return to a stable (well) \nmedical management state at a normal dose of \nPPIs. Patients receiving surgery following relapse \non medical management faced the same transition \nprobabilities as surgical patients post surgery. \nThey could also receive one reoperation following \nsurgery failure. Medical management following two \noperations was deemed a total failure and patients \nwere placed on a double dose of PPIs for the \nremainder of their lives. \nChapter 3  \nPreliminary economic modelling\nA preliminary comparison of the cost-effectiveness of \npharmacotherapy and surgery (laparoscopic fundoplication) \nin the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux diseasePreliminary economic modelling\n12\nF\nI\nG\nU\nR\nE\n \n3\n \nS\nt\nr\nu\nc\nt\nu\nr\ne\n \no\nf\n \nt\nh\ne\n \np\nr\ne\nl\ni\nm\ni\nn\na\nr\ny\n \ne\nc\no\nn\no\nm\ni\nc\n \nm\no\nd\ne\nl\n.\n \n4\nV\nS\nH\nF\nS\nZ\n4\nV\nS\nH\nF\nS\nZ\n.\nF\nE\nJ\nD\nB\nM\nN\nB\nO\nB\nH\nF\nN\nF\nO\nU\n\"\nM\nJ\nW\nF\n4\n)\n0\n3\n5\n\u000e\n5\n&\n3\n.\n\u0001\n.\n0\n%\n&\n-\n-\n0\n\/\n(\n\u000e\n5\n&\n3\n.\n\u0001\n.\n0\n%\n&\n-\n%\nF\nB\nE\n\"\nM\nJ\nW\nF\n%\nF\nB\nE\n\"\nM\nJ\nW\nF\n%\nF\nB\nE\n4\nV\nS\nH\nF\nS\nZ\n8\nF\nM\nM\n\t\nD\nV\nS\nF\nE\n\n\n4\nV\nS\nH\nF\nS\nZ\n'\nB\nJ\nM\n\t\nS\nF\nM\nB\nQ\nT\nF\n\n\n4\nV\nS\nH\nF\nS\nZ\n8\nF\nM\nM\n\t\nD\nV\nS\nF\nE\n\n\n4\nV\nS\nH\nF\nS\nZ\n'\nB\nJ\nM\n\t\nS\nF\nM\nB\nQ\nT\nF\n\n\n4\nV\nS\nH\nF\nS\nZ\n8\nF\nM\nM\n\t\nD\nV\nS\nF\nE\n\n\n4\nV\nS\nH\nF\nS\nZ\n'\nB\nJ\nM\n\t\nS\nF\nM\nB\nQ\nT\nF\n\n\n4\nV\nS\nH\nF\nS\nZ\n8\nF\nM\nM\n\t\nD\nV\nS\nF\nE\n\n\n4\nV\nS\nH\nF\nS\nZ\n'\nB\nJ\nM\n\t\nS\nF\nM\nB\nQ\nT\nF\n\n\n4\nV\nS\nH\nF\nS\nZ\n3\nF\n\u000e\nP\nQ\nF\nS\nB\nU\nF\n4\nV\nS\nH\nF\nS\nZ\n3\nF\n\u000e\nP\nQ\nF\nS\nB\nU\nF\n.\nF\nE\nJ\nD\nB\nM\nN\nB\nO\nB\nH\nF\nN\nF\nO\nU\n8\nF\nM\nM\n.\nF\nE\nJ\nD\nB\nM\nN\nB\nO\nB\nH\nF\nN\nF\nO\nU\n8\nF\nM\nM\n.\nF\nE\nJ\nD\nB\nM\nN\nB\nO\nB\nH\nF\nN\nF\nO\nU\n3\nF\nM\nB\nQ\nT\nF\n.\nF\nE\nJ\nD\nB\nM\nN\nB\nO\nB\nH\nF\nN\nF\nO\nU\n8\nF\nM\nM\n.\nF\nE\nJ\nD\nB\nM\nN\nB\nO\nB\nH\nF\nN\nF\nO\nU\n3\nF\nM\nB\nQ\nT\nF\n.\nF\nE\nJ\nD\nB\nM\nN\nB\nO\nB\nH\nF\nN\nF\nO\nU\n)\nJ\nH\nI\n\u0001\nE\nP\nT\nF\n.\nF\nE\nJ\nD\nB\nM\nN\nB\nO\nB\nH\nF\nN\nF\nO\nU\n)\nJ\nH\nI\n\u0001\nE\nP\nT\nF\n\"\nM\nJ\nW\nF\n%\nF\nB\nE\n4\nV\nS\nH\nF\nS\nZ\n8\nF\nM\nM\n\t\nD\nV\nS\nF\nE\n\n\n4\nV\nS\nH\nF\nS\nZ\n'\nB\nJ\nM\n\t\nS\nF\nM\nB\nQ\nT\nF\n\n\n.\nF\nE\nJ\nD\nB\nM\nN\nB\nO\nB\nH\nF\nN\nF\nO\nU\n8\nF\nM\nM\n.\nF\nE\nJ\nD\nB\nM\nN\nB\nO\nB\nH\nF\nN\nF\nO\nU\n)\nJ\nH\nI\n\u0001\nE\nP\nT\nFHealth Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

The age-specific death rate for men \naged from 45 to 54 years was obtained from the \nUK Office of National Statistics (ONS)48 and used \nto calculate the probability of death from natural \ncauses from one cycle to the next. \nEvidence to populate the model\nLiterature searches were undertaken to identify \nstudies attempting to measure quality of life \n(measured by the EQ-5D) in relation to GORD or \nthose providing information on the probability \nof movement between transition states during \ntreatment. Searches were restricted to MEDLINE, \nEMBASE and internet sources, such as the \nDatabase of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness \n(DARE). Studies carried out before 1995 were \nnot included as medical and surgical treatments \nfor GORD were expected to have advanced \nsignificantly in the past 10 years, particularly in \nrelation to relapse rates from surgery. The search \nstrategies are shown in Appendix 9. This research \nwas conducted in December 2005.\nFixed-effects meta-analysis techniques were used \nto synthesise data from multiple sources.

The resources used were estimated \nthrough a survey of five of the hospitals involved \nin the R e f l u x  trial. The lengths of surgery and of \nhospital stay were taken from the laparoscopic \nfundoplication baseline data for the R e f l u x  trial. An \nadditional 15 minutes was added to the duration of \noperation to derive a total length of surgery, as the \ntime from anaesthesia to recovery recorded in the \nR e f l u x  trial did not allow for preparation time. \nTypical daily dosages of PPIs and other medicines \nused in medical maintenance of GORD were \nalso obtained from the R e f l u x  trial baseline \nquestionnaire using data for the month before \nstudy entry. An average daily dose was calculated \nfor each drug and used to derive an average daily \ncost of medical treatment.\nCosts\nTable 2 shows the estimated monthly cost of \ndrugs or surgery per patient and their associated \ndistributions, which reflect the heterogeneity \nbetween centres and differences in pack sizes for \nmedications.\nCosts of all medicines were taken from the British \nNational Formulary (2005)63 and an assumption was \nmade that lowest cost prescribing was used (e.g. \ngeneric formulations and tablets). The average \ndaily cost of medical treatment was calculated and \nthe model assumed that, in the event of a relapse \non medical treatment, the dose would be doubled \nfor a period of 1 month. Direct surgical treatment \ncosts included the costs of preoperative screening \nfor GORD, surgery and hospital stay. For theatre \nstaff costs, salaries were taken as the mid-point on \nthe relevant scale for each grade or professional. \nCosts of perioperative procedures were taken from \nprovider-to-provider tariffs for various hospitals \nor from published sources,64,65 and the frequency \nof such procedures was calculated from the \nlaparoscopic fundoplication baseline data in the \nR e f l u x  trial. Costs of surgical revision or conversion \nto open fundoplication were assumed to be the \nsame as those of the original operation. In the \ncase of open fundoplication, a hospital stay of 6 \ndays was assumed and a cost loading (average cost \nwas inflated to account for the expected number \nof high-cost rare events) applied based on a meta-\nanalysis of published information.45,51,58,66,67\nThe cost of oesophageal dilatation for dysphagia \n(swallowing difficulties), the most commonly \noccurring postoperative corrective surgery \nencountered, was taken from Leeds General \nInfirmary and a cost loading was added to the \ntotal cost of surgery. Along with death, this was \nthe only complication of surgery considered in \nthese analyses. Costs of endoscopic disposables \nwere obtained from a manufacturer, Ethicon Endo-\nSurgery. Costs of disposable drapes and gowns \ncame from Kimberly-Clark Health Care, UK. \nCapital costs associated with standard laparoscopic \nsurgery installations were obtained from Karl Storz \nGmbH and Ethicon Endo-Surgery. An assumption \nwas made that the service life of a laparoscopic \ninstallation was 5 years and the capital costs were \namortised (3.5% per annum) over that period. \nFurthermore, a capital cost for laparoscopic \nfundoplication was calculated assuming 200 \noperations were undertaken in that period in each \ncentre. \nAppendix 10 summarises the costs associated with \nsurgery. Variation between centres largely reflects \ndiffering staff mix and variation in the use of \ndisposables.\nHealth outcomes\nOutcomes were expressed as QALYs with patients\u2019 \nHRQoL measured by the EQ-5D.

EQ-5D values obtained for the UK \ngeneral population (population norms) aged \nfrom 45 to 54 years were taken from Kind et \nal.70 and were considered to represent a \u2018cured\u2019 \nstate (successful surgery). HRQoL in the month \nimmediately following laparoscopic fundoplication \nwas taken from EQ-5D values as measured in \npatients following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.71 \nPatients with unresolved symptoms of GORD \n(relapse) were assigned a utility based on the \ndecrement between stable medical management \nand reflux symptoms estimated in a published \nexpert opinion (0.53).72 The utility values used and \ntheir sources are summarised in Table 3. \nAnalysis\nThe model was developed in Excel with the \nCrystal Ball \u2018add-on\u2019. Monte Carlo simulation \nwas used to propagate the prior distributions \nassigned to model inputs and estimate the \nexpected costs and outcomes associated with each \nalternative therapy; incremental cost-effectiveness \nratios (ICER) were calculated. Distributions for \nparameters were selected on the basis of the \nnature of the parameter concerned.73 To conduct \nthe simulations, the distributions reported in \nTable 1 were assigned to the model inputs to \ncharacterise the current uncertainty surrounding \ntheir values. The simulation recalculated the \nresults over 10,000 iterations. For each iteration, \nthe value of each variable was sampled at random \nfrom the distributions specified. By repeating the \ncalculations of expected costs and outcomes in this \nway, distributions of estimates are obtained, which \nallow estimation of the mean expected costs and \nQALYs and associated distributions. \nThe results of the model are presented in two \nways. First, mean costs and QALYs for the various \ncomparators are presented and their cost-\neffectiveness compared, using standard decision \nrules to estimate ICER as appropriate. Second, \ngiven that mean costs and QALYs gained are \nestimated with uncertainty, the output from the \nsimulations have been used to generate cost-\neffectiveness acceptability curves. These curves \nillustrate the probability of surgery being more \ncost-effective than medical management given a \nrange of values that an NHS decision-maker might \nattach to an additional QALY. Threshold values of \ncost-effectiveness ranging from \u00a30 to \u00a3100,000 per \nadditional QALY were used in the analysis. This \nis a Bayesian approach to the presentation of cost \neffectiveness, although this is not a full Bayesian \nanalysis.74,75\nThe output of these simulations was also used to \nestimate the expected value of perfect information \n(EVPI).76,77 The cost in terms of health benefits \nand resources forgone if a wrong decision is made \ncan be described using the probability of making \nan error based on current knowledge and the \nconsequences of a wrong decision. Thus, the \nexpected costs of uncertainty can be interpreted \nas the EVPI, as perfect information would obviate \ndecision error. The EVPI is, therefore, the \nmaximum that the health-care system should be \nwilling to pay for additional evidence to inform \nthis decision in the future, that is, the maximum \nexpenditure in relevant future research. Per patient \nEVPI was calculated and, in addition, an analysis \nof the EVPI associated with particular items of \nevidence used in the model was also conducted. \nTABLE 3  EQ-5D values, distributions and sources\nState Utility Distribution Sources \nQoL on stable medical maintenance 0.72 Gamma (0.02\u20138.38) re f l u x  study baseline data\nQoL during relapse 0.56 Gamma (0.02\u20135.29) re f l u x  study baseline data; Heudebert \net al., 199772\nQoL following surgery 0.61 Fixed Ainslie et al., 200371\nQoL in cured post-surgical state 0.84 Gamma (0.25\u201311.29) UK male (45\u201354 years) population norms \n(Kind et al., 199970)\nQoL, quality of life.Preliminary economic modelling\n16\nThis can be used to focus research on those \nelements in the decision for which more precise \nestimates would be most valuable.76\u201378 \nResults\nBase-case cost-effectiveness\nThe base-case estimates of costs and QALYs \nassociated with surgery are shown in Table 4. Over \na lifetime, medical management (\u00a34890) was \nestimated to cost less than surgery (\u00a35014) but it \nwas associated with fewer QALYs than surgery: \n12.36 compared with 13.04.\nThe lifetime ICER for surgery versus medical \nmanagement is thus \u00a3180. Based on this, as long \nas decision-makers are willing to pay more than \n\u00a3180 for an additional QALY, surgery would be \nregarded as the more cost-effective treatment \noption. However, mean costs and QALYs were \nestimated with uncertainty. Figure 4 shows the \npotential impact of the uncertainty in mean \ndifferences (surgery minus medical management) \nin costs and QALYs gained between the two groups \n(i.e. it shows mean costs and QALY differences \nbased on the 1000 simulations). Figure 5 represents \nthis uncertainty in the form of a cost-effectiveness \nacceptability curve. The probability that surgery is \ncost-effective at a threshold of cost-effectiveness of \n\u00a330,000 per QALY is 0.639. \nExpected value of \nperfect information\nThe per patient EVPI for adults with GORD \nis illustrated in Figure 6. At a cost-effectiveness \nthreshold of \u00a330,000, EVPI is substantial at \n\u00a315,106. At a threshold of \u00a320,000, the EVPI is \n\u00a310,081. EVPI for groups of parameters showed \nthat all of the value of further research (\u00a311,346 \nat a threshold of \u00a330,000 for cost-effectiveness) is \nassociated with the quality of life implications of \nmedical or surgical therapies, indicating that this is \nwhere future research should focus.\nAlternative model assumptions\nAlternative assumptions regarding the model \nstructure were explored, specifically the effect of \nany delay to receiving surgery (1 month and 1 \nyear) and the risk of relapse from surgery 5 years \npostoperatively. \nAssuming that there is no risk of surgical failure \n5 years post operation reduces the total cost of \nsurgery (to \u00a34121) and increases QALYs (to 13.48). \nAlthough total costs (\u00a34887) and QALYs (12.38) \nchange for medical management, because of the \nsmall number of people receiving surgery following \nmedical management relapse, the effect of this \nis only minor. Surgery now dominates medical \nmanagement as it has lower costs and higher \nQALYs. Decision uncertainty is, however, relatively \ninsensitive to this structural change, with the \nprobability that surgery is cost-effective increased \nfrom 0.639 in the base-case model to 0.642 at a \nthreshold of \u00a330,000. As we are somewhat more \ncertain about the decision to recommend surgery as \nthe most cost-effective treatment, per patient EVPI \ndecreases by a small amount from \u00a315,106 in the \nbase-case model to \u00a315,078.\nIncorporating any delays to surgery had very little \neffect on both the costs and the QALYs. This is \nbecause time spent in the \u2018wait\u2019 state was assigned \na relatively small cost of medical management \nand the utility of stable management. Decision \nuncertainty and EVPI was also largely unaffected by \ndelays to surgery.\nDiscussion\nThis was the first investigation of the cost-\neffectiveness of lifelong medical treatment \ncompared with immediate laparoscopic \nfundoplication for the treatment of GORD. The \nresults of this model suggest that, even when the \nrisk of spontaneous failure of surgery exists for a \npatient\u2019s lifetime, surgery for GORD is more cost-\neffective than lifelong management with drugs. \nTABLE 4  Cost-effectiveness of surgery versus medical management for the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease\nTotal costs (\u00a3) Total QALYs ICER\nSurgery 5014.17 13.04 \u00a3180.61\nMedical management 4890.59 12.36\nICER, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio; QALYs, quality-adjusted life-years.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

The number of people with GORD suitable \nfor surgery is likely to be sizeable and therefore \nthe EVPI of \u00a315,106 at a threshold of \u00a330,000 per \nQALY implies that the EVPI will exceed the cost of \nfurther investigation. This, in turn, suggests that \nfurther research will be potentially cost-effective. \nEVPI analysis on groups of parameters suggested \nthat further research should focus on collecting \nevidence relating to the HRQoL of patients on \nmedical management and following surgery.\nIt was necessary to make a number of assumptions \nin the model. First, in the absence of applicable \ndata, it was necessary to simplify the dosing \nadjustment used to deal with relapse.

The effect of this would probably \nbe that patients in relapse spend more than 1 \nmonth on a higher dose (and at higher cost) and \nsimultaneously experience lower HRQoL for \nlonger than modelled here. At present, given that \nequal consequences of relapse have been applied to \nthose patients relapsing on medical management \nor surgery, it is unlikely that applying a more \ncomplex relapse dosing structure would have a \nsignificant effect on the results of the model.\nSecond, the costs of surgery only partially capture \ntrue cost. Surgery may have unwanted side effects \nor may spontaneously fail at some point in the \nfuture. Treatment of side effects or surgical failure \nhas costs both in monetary and quality of life terms. \nA common side effect, temporary difficulty with \nswallowing (dysphagia), has been considered in \nthe model and a probabilised cost loading used to \nincorporate its treatment. However, no disutility of \ndysphagia, bloating, flatulence or other unwanted \nside effects following surgery has been included in \nthe model because of a lack of data and consensus \non the magnitude of effect. Related to this is the \navailability of data for other states in the model. \nIn the absence of other suitable data, the utility \nvalues used to reflect the post-surgical state were \nbased on patients measured following laparoscopic \ncholecystectomy,71 which has some surgical \nsimilarities to laparoscopic fundoplication but \nmay not have the same spectrum of postoperative \ndiscomfort or complications. The utility value \nassociated with a surgical cure has been taken from \nUK age-specific population norms.70 Also, it is \nunclear to what extent the post-surgical state can be \nlikened to the utility of an average member of the \nUK population, that is, whether surgery actually \ngenerates a cure in utility terms. \nFinally, because of the focus on those patients \ncurrently maintained on medical management, \nthe analysis reported here did not consider \nmanagement strategies other than medical \nmanagement or surgery. In many clinical settings \nlifestyle management advice is being favoured as \na first-line option, with medical management or \nsurgery considered only as second-line therapies in \npatients who do not respond to lifestyle changes. \nThis may limit the applicability of this model in \ncertain settings.\nDespite these necessary assumptions, the model \npresented here represents the first attempt to \ngenerate estimates of cost per QALY for surgical \nand medical management strategies for the \ntreatment of GORD patients in the UK. The \nresults of the model suggest that, on the basis of \ncurrent evidence, laparoscopic fundoplication may \nwell represent a cost-effective means of treating \nGORD rather than lifelong medical management. \nCoupled with the apparent safety of the surgical \nprocedure (in experienced hands), patients and \nthe health service may benefit from increased \nsubstitution of surgery for medical management. \nWhat this preliminary analysis confirmed was the \nneed for more robust data, especially in respect of \nHRQoL, and these data were being generated in \nthe R e f l u x  trial. \nFIGURE 6  Per patient expected value of perfect information (EVPI).\n5ISFTIPME\u0001GPS\u0001DPTU\u000eFGGFDUJWFOFTT\u0001\tb\u0011\u0011\u0011\n\n1\nF\nS\n\u0001\nQ\nB\nU\nJ\nF\nO\nU\n\u0001\n&\n7\n1\n*\n\u0001\n\t\nb\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\n\n\u0017\u0011\n\u0016\u0011\n\u0015\u0011\n\u0014\u0011\n\u0013\u0011\n\u0012\u0011\n\u0012\u0011 \u0013\u0011 \u0014\u0011 \u0015\u0011 \u0016\u0011 \u0017\u0011 \u0018\u0011 \u0019\u0011 \u001a\u0011 \u0012\u0011\u0011 \u0011\n\u0011Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

Of \nparticular concern was that these measures do \nnot reflect patients\u2019 experiences of the side effects \nof surgery for GORD, which include general \ngastrointestinal symptoms as well as oesophageal \nreflux itself.85 A new condition-specific outcome \nmeasure was therefore developed for use within \nthe R e f l u x  trial. The aim of this measure was not \nonly to assess the symptoms of GORD but also the \nside effects of both medical and surgical treatment \nfor GORD and the effects that these have on \nHRQoL. There were two requirements for the new \nmeasure: it had to measure HRQoL and not merely \nsymptom experience; and its content had to cover \nthe effects of treatment for GORD as well as the \nsymptoms of GORD. This chapter describes the \ndevelopment and assessment of the new measure. \nMethod\nQuestionnaire development\nBetween May and September 2000, a series of one-\nto-one interviews and focus groups were conducted \nwith patients in two cities, Leeds and Aberdeen, \nto identify those themes and issues related to \nGORD and its treatment that were important to \npeople affected by GORD. In total, 31 people were \ninterviewed, 15 receiving medical treatment and \n16 who had received surgery. In addition, two focus \ngroups were conducted, each with six patients, one \nin Aberdeen and one in Leeds. Both focus groups \nincluded only patients who had received surgery \nfor their GORD symptoms, identified via their \ngastroenterologist or surgeon.\nBoth the interviews and focus groups followed the \nsame general format. Patients were asked questions \nabout the types and severity of symptoms they \nexperienced, how best to describe their symptoms, \nwhether they felt that their symptoms were best \ndescribed by their frequency, duration or level of \ndistress, and about the impact that their symptoms \nhad on their daily lives. \nAll interviews and focus groups were audiotaped \nand transcribed. These transcripts underwent \nthematic analysis by three members of the trial \nteam. Emerging themes and issues suggested \npotential questionnaire items. Whenever possible \nthe language used by patients was used when \ndevising the questionnaire items. The transcripts \nshowed that the frequency of symptoms and \ntheir effects on quality of life were the two most \ncommonly reported themes by patients. This led to \nthe development of 31 possible questions. \nPiloting \nThe initial version of the questionnaire (with the \n31 items) was piloted on a sample of 21 patients \nfrom Aberdeen, some of whom had taken part in \nthe interview phase. The questionnaire was posted \nout to the patients asking them to complete it. \nAt a later date they were interviewed about its \nreadability and acceptability. Specifically, they \nwere asked about whether they had any problems \nunderstanding the items, whether the response \ncategories were appropriate for them and whether \nthey thought that anything was missing from the \nquestionnaire. The questionnaire was modified \nfollowing the feedback from these interviews. At \nthis stage a small number of items (three) were \ndiscarded as unsuitable or potentially ambiguous, \nothers were reworded and three items that were \nnot originally included in the initial version of \nthe questionnaire, but were repeatedly mentioned \nby the patients and felt to be of importance, were \nadded. The new version therefore also had 31 \nitems. Re f l u x outcome measure\n20\nFinal questionnaire\nThe 31 items that were included in the formally \nevaluated version of the questionnaire were \ngrouped into seven categories (heartburn; acid \nreflux; wind; eating and swallowing; bowel \nmovements; sleep; and work, physical and \nsocial activities) describing symptoms relating to \nGORD or side effects of treatment (Table 5). For \neach category respondents were asked to show \nhow often they had experienced problems with \nspecified symptoms over the past 2 weeks, followed \nby how much they felt that those symptoms had \naffected their quality of life over the past 2 weeks. \nThe symptom items offered five responses, from \n\u2018not at all\u2019 to \u2018every day\u2019, and the quality of life \nitems offered five responses \u2013 \u2018not at all\u2019, \u2018a little\u2019, \n\u2018moderately\u2019, \u2018a lot\u2019 and \u2018extremely\u2019. Items in the \nleast clinical of the categories, work, physical and \nsocial activities, offered six responses including \u2018not \napplicable\u2019 (see the R e f l u x  questionnaire within \nAppendix 2). \nData\nThe new measure, along with two generic measures \nof HRQoL (EQ-5D88 and SF-3689) and information \non background, demographics and use of \nmedicine, was included in a postal questionnaire, \nwhich was sent to all R e f l u x  trial participants. \nTrial participants were sent a questionnaire at \nbaseline after they had agreed to take part in the \ntrial, at first follow-up (3 months after surgery or \nits equivalent for non-surgical participants) and \nat second follow-up (12 months after surgery or \nequivalent). This chapter reports on data received \nby December 2004. Most of the analysis presented \nhere was performed on the baseline data, but \nanalysis of sensitivity to change also used the first \nfollow-up data.\nAnalysis\nDeveloping a scoring system\nWe planned that the new measure would produce \ntwo different types of score:\na  \u2022\t R e f l u x  quality of life score (RQLS) \nsummarising the extent to which respondents\u2019 \nsymptoms affect their quality of life, where 0 is \nthe worst quality of life and 100 is the best\na series of seven  \u2022\t R e f l u x  symptom scores that \nprofile respondents\u2019 experiences of these \ngroups of symptoms over the past 2 weeks. \nAlthough it is possible to generate summary scores \nby merely summing the raw scores on each item, \nthis assumes that all items in the measure are \nequally important. This disregards the possibility \nthat some items are more important than others \nand should therefore have a larger emphasis in the \nfinal score. We chose to use two distinct methods \nof weighting the contribution of items to the total \nscore.\nThe R e f l u x  questionnaire contains seven quality \nof life items, each relating to one of its seven \ncategories, that require participants to indicate \nhow much they feel their symptoms on a particular \ndimension in the past 2 weeks have affected their \ngeneral quality of life. Weights for the RQLS were \nestimated by assessing the influence of these items \non participants\u2019 assessments of their general quality \nof life. We used the seven baseline quality of life \nitems as independent variables in an ordinary least \nsquares (OLS) regression model with participants\u2019 \nassessments of their general HRQoL, as measured \nby the EQ-5D visual analogue scale (EQ-5D VAS), \nas the dependent variable. For modelling purposes \nwe assumed that the data from these items were \ncardinal. EQ-5D VAS requires respondents to \nassess their current state of health on a 0\u2013100 \nvisual analogue scale, where 0 represents worst \nimaginable health and 100 best imaginable health. \nTo remain in the model, regression coefficients \ndid not have to be statistically significant but they \ndid have to have the correct (negative) sign, i.e. \na reported detrimental effect on quality of life \nshould be associated with a decrease in EQ-5D \nVAS score. The resulting coefficients were used as \nweighting factors to calculate a general quality of \nlife summary score. \nIn contrast, weights for the R e f l u x  symptom \nsummary scores were generated by entering \nthe 31 baseline symptom items into a principal \ncomponents analysis (PCA) with a Varimax \nrotation. We judged how many components \nor factors to extract by using a combination of \nTABLE 5  Re f l u x categories\nCategory\nNumber of \nitems\nHeartburn 3\nAcid reflux 6\nWind 5\nEating and swallowing 3\nBowel movements 5\nSleep 4\nWork, physical and social activities 5Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

The resulting factor loadings were \nused as the item weights to calculate a number of \nsymptom scores. \nReliability, validity and \nsensitivity to change\nWe assessed the reliability of the R e f l u x  quality of \nlife and symptom scores by internal consistency, \nas measured by Cronbach\u2019s alpha. In contrast, our \nassessment of the validity and responsiveness or \nsensitivity to change concentrated on the quality \nof life score, as this was the main aim of the \nmeasure. The validity of the RQLS was assessed \nby comparing its performance against the SF-36. \nSensitivity to change was assessed by the measure\u2019s \nability to reflect changes in the condition of \nparticipants, as assessed by self-reported change in \nprescribed medication between baseline and first \nfollow-up. Participants were asked to give details of \ntheir prescribed medication use (PPIs, H2RAs and \nanti-emetics) at baseline and at first follow-up. This \ninformation was used to classify whether or not \ntheir medication use had changed between these \ntimes. \nResults\nSample characteristics \nBetween March 2001 and June 2004 a total of 810 \nparticipants had been recruited into the R e f l u x  \ntrial, of whom 799 had completed and returned \ntheir baseline questionnaires. By December 2004 \n602 participants out of 649 (93%) had returned a \nfirst follow-up questionnaire, and 418 out of 447 \n(94%) a second follow-up questionnaire. At baseline \n64% of the sample was male, and the median age at \ntrial entry was 46 years (range 18\u201374 years). \nScoring\nGenerating weights for the \nr e f l u x  quality of life score\nAll 727 participants with complete baseline data \non the R e f l u x  quality of life items and EQ-5D VAS \nwere included in the analysis. Although coefficients \nfor three of the seven quality of life items were \nnot statistically significant, we kept them in the \nregression model for completeness. In contrast, \nwe excluded the wind item from the RQLS model \nas the coefficient consistently showed the wrong \nsign and was not statistically significant. In effect, \nthe wind item will receive a weight of zero when \ncalculating the final score. The work, physical and \nsocial activities item had the largest coefficient and \nthus had most effect on the EQ-5D VAS, and the \nsleep item had the smallest coefficient. The final \nmodel coefficients used to calculate the RQLS are \ngiven in Table 6.\nThe coefficients from this model were used as \nweights for calculating the quality of life score by \nmultiplying the response to each quality of life \nitem (coded from 0 \u2018not at all\u2019 to 4 \u2018extremely\u2019) \nby the corresponding weight (i.e. the coefficient \nfrom Table 6) and subtracting these values from the \nconstant term as follows:\nRaw RQLS = 90 \u2013 (heartburn quality \nof life \u00d7 1.35) \u2013 (acid reflux quality of \nlife \u00d7 1.70) \u2013 (wind quality of life \u00d7 0) \u2013 (eating \nquality of life \u00d7 1.10) \u2013 (bowel movement \nquality of life \u00d7 1.95) \u2013 (sleep quality of \nlife \u00d7 0.35) \u2013 (activities quality of life \u00d7 2.15).\nThe score was then standardised to a scale from 0 \n(worst quality of life) to 100 (best quality of life) as \nfollows:\nStandardised RQLS = (raw RQLS \u2013 55.6) \u00d7 2.91.\nTABLE 6  Model coefficients used to calculate the R e f l u x quality of life score (RQLS)\nRe f l u x  quality of life item B SE Significance\nHeartburn \u20131.346 0.81 NS\nAcid reflux \u20131.700 0.70 < 0.05\nEating and swallowing \u20131.103 0.68 NS\nBowel movements \u20131.954 0.61 < 0.01\nSleep \u20130.351 0.66 NS\nWork, physical and social activities \u20132.147 0.84 < 0.05\nConstant 89.995 1.51 < 0.001\nB, beta; NS, not significant; SE, standard error.\nAdj r2 = 0.22.Re f l u x outcome measure\n22\nFigure 7 presents the frequency distribution of \nquality of life scores for patients at baseline. The \nmean score was 65.0 with a standard deviation of \n24.3. \nGenerating weights for the \nr e f l u x  symptom scores\nThe PCA identified five components that \naccounted for 57% of the variance in the items \n(Table 7). In general, the component structure \nreflected the themes identified when the items \nwere developed; however, component 1 grouped \ntogether heartburn-like symptoms and sleep \ndisruption into general discomfort (Table 7). The \nfirst component after rotation explained 19% of \nthe total variance and included seven items with \nloadings above 0.4. Component 2 explained 12% \nof the total variance and included six main items. \nThe remaining three components accounted \nrespectively for 10%, 9% and 8% of the total \nvariance. Component loadings were used to \nconstruct a profile of five R e f l u x  symptom scores to \nsummarise an individual\u2019s symptom experience. In \nthe first instance we suggested the following labels \nfor these components: 1 = general discomfort; \n2 = wind and frequency; 3 = nausea and vomiting; \n4 = activity limitation; and 5 = constipation and \nswallowing.\nEach symptom score was calculated by multiplying \nthe response to each of the symptom items in that \nscore (coded from 0 \u2018every day\u2019 to 4 \u2018not at all\u2019) \nby the corresponding weight (i.e. the component \nloading for that item from Table 7) and then \nsumming across the items. For the four items in \nactivity limitation we grouped the response codes \n\u2018not applicable\u2019 and \u2018no, my symptoms do not \naffect me\u2019 as 4, and recoded the other categories \nfrom 0 \u2018I no longer work\/perform these activities \nbecause of my symptoms\u2019 to 3 \u2018my symptoms \nhave affected me but I still work\/perform these \nactivities\u2019. Symptom scores were then standardised \nto a scale from 0 (worst symptom score) to 100 (best \nsymptom score) as follows:\nGeneral discomfort = 5.24 \u00d7 [(item \nA1 \u00d7 0.674) + (item A2 \u00d7 0.643) + (item \nB1 \u00d7 0.654) + (item D2 \u00d7 0.421) + (item \nF1 \u00d7 0.777) + (item F2 \u00d7 0.814) + (item \nF3 \u00d7 0.791)].\nWind and frequency = 6.59 \u00d7 [(item \nC1 \u00d7 0.738) + (item C2 \u00d7 0.553) + (item \nC3 \u00d7 0.568) + (item C4 \u00d7 0.515) + (item \nE1 \u00d7 0.722) + (item E3 \u00d7 0.696)].\nNausea and vomiting = 9.84 \u00d7 [(item \nB2 \u00d7 0.734) + (item B3 \u00d7 0.556) + (item \nB4 \u00d7 0.541) + (item B5 \u00d7 0.709)].\nActivity limitation = 9.58 \u00d7 [(item \nG1 \u00d7 0.695) + (item G2 \u00d7 0.571) + (item \nG3 \u00d7 0.755) + (item G4 \u00d7 0.588)].\nConstipation and swallowing = 13.72 \u00d7 [(item \nD1 \u00d7 0.338) + (item E2 \u00d7 0.839) + (item \nE4 \u00d7 0.645)].\nTable 8 presents the mean symptom scores at \nbaseline. There were pronounced ceiling effects for \nnausea and vomiting, constipation and swallowing, \nand activity limitations: 26%, 25% and 17% \nrespectively of the sample had a maximum score \nof 100. In contrast, wind and frequency showed a \nmore normal distribution.\nBoth the RQLS and R e f l u x  symptom scores were \ncalculated only for individuals with complete data. \nFIGURE 7  Distribution of R e f l u x quality of life scores (RQLS).\n32-4\n\u0011\u000f\u0011 \u0012\u0011\u000f\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0013\u0011\u000f\u0011\n\u0013\u0011\n\u0014\u0011\u000f\u0011 \u0015\u0011\u000f\u0011\n\u0015\u0011\n\u0016\u0011\u000f\u0011 \u0017\u0011\u000f\u0011\n\u0017\u0011\n\u0018\u0011\u000f\u0011 \u0019\u0011\u000f\u0011\n\u0019\u0011\n\u001a\u0011\u000f\u0011\u0012\u0011\u0011\u000f\u0011\n\u0012\u0011\u0011\n'\nS\nF\nR\nV\nF\nO\nD\nZHealth Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

Social functioning and bodily pain showed \nthe best relationships with the RQLS, and mental \nhealth the worst. \nTable 10 presents the proportion of respondents \nwho had a score of 100 (best health) on the SF-36 \ndimensions as a percentage of those who had a best \nscore of 100 on the RQLS. Whereas 96% of those \nwho had the maximum score on the SF-36 physical \nfunctioning dimension also had a score of 100 on \nthe RQLS, only 31% of those who had a score of \n100 on the SF-36 bodily pain dimension also had a \nscore of 100 on the RQLS. \nFigure 8 plots the mean RQLS against the SF-36 \nmental component score (MCS) and physical \ncomponent score (PCS) grouped into fifths. The \nmean RQLS increases steadily and significantly \nbetween successive PCS groups. There is a similar \npattern for MCS groups except that respondents \nin the highest fifth have a lower mean RQLS than \nthose in the next lower fifth. \nSensitivity to change\nParticipants reported whether they were being \nprescribed medication at baseline and first follow-\nup. This information was used to classify them \ninto four groups: those prescribed medication at \nbaseline and follow-up (n = 293); those prescribed \nmedication at baseline but not follow-up (n = 186); \nthose prescribed medication at follow-up but \nnot baseline (n = 3); and those not prescribed \nmedication at all (n = 7). As the last groups are \nreassuringly small, Figure 9 presents mean change \nin RQLS (baseline score \u2013 follow-up score) for the \nfirst two groups. \nA negative score indicates an improvement in \nquality of life. Although the RQLS improved for \nboth groups (paired t-tests showed significant \nchange), patients whose medication status changed \nbetween baseline and follow-up (medication at \nbaseline but not at follow-up) showed a greater \nimprovement in their RQLS than patients whose \nmedication status stayed the same (medication at \nbaseline and follow-up). \nDiscussion\nPrincipal findings\nThis chapter describes a new outcome measure \nfor use with patients being treated for GORD. \nThe R e f l u x  questionnaire comprises 31 items and \ngenerates a single score (RQLS) measuring the \nextent to which individual participants feel that \ntheir GORD symptoms, and any side effects of \ntreatment, affect their quality of life. The 31 items \nalso generate five reflux symptom scores measuring \nthe extent to which participants experienced \nclusters of symptoms over the previous 2 weeks. \nThus, the RQLS provides a single index that can \nbe used to record change for evaluation, whereas \nthe symptom scores provide a descriptive profile \nthat describes whether respondents experience \nproblems in specific clusters. The data presented \nprovide evidence that the new measure is valid, \nreliable and sensitive to change.

Items were generated by using \nGORD patients as key informants, rather than \nrelying on the views of clinicians or other experts. \nTherefore the R e f l u x  questionnaire covers those \nelements of their illness that GORD patients \nindicated were important in determining their \nquality of life. A patient-centred approach also \nunderlies the scoring system used to generate the \nRQLS. The weights used to create this score were \nbased on the relationship between participants\u2019 \nreports of their scores on seven quality of life \nitems and of their general health status on a visual \nanalogue scale. The score takes account of patients\u2019 \npreferences through their self-reported effect on \nquality of life. In contrast, the R e f l u x  symptom \nscores, which were not intended as measures \nof HRQoL, used essentially statistical weights, \ngenerated from principal components analysis of \nsymptom frequencies rather than patients\u2019 views. \nFIGURE 8  Re f l u x quality of life score (RQLS) by SF-36 mental component summary score and physical component summary score \n(grouped into fifths).\nFIGURE 9  Change in R e f l u x quality of life score (RQLS) by change in prescribed medication (baseline to follow-up).\n.FOUBM\u0001DPNQPOFOU\u0001TVNNBSZ\u0001TDPSF 1IZTJDBM\u0001DPNQPOFOU\u0001TVNNBSZ\u0001TDPSF\n\u0012\u0011\u0011\n\u001a\u0011\n\u0019\u0011\n\u0018\u0011\n\u0017\u0011\n\u0016\u0011\n\u0015\u0011\n\u0014\u0011\n\u0012\u0015\u001a\n\u0012\u000f\u0011\u0011\nO\u001e \u0012\u0015\u0017\n\u0013\u000f\u0011\u0011\n\u0012\u0015\u0019\n\u0014\u000f\u0011\u0011\n\u0012\u0015\u0017\n\u0015\u000f\u0011\u0011\n\u0012\u0015\u0018\n\u0016\u000f\u0011\u0011\n\u001a\n\u0016\n\u0006\n\u0001\n$\nM\n\u0001\n3\n2\n-\n4\n\u0012\u0011\u0011\n\u001a\u0011\n\u0019\u0011\n\u0018\u0011\n\u0017\u0011\n\u0016\u0011\n\u0015\u0011\n\u0014\u0011\n\u0012\u0015\u001a\n\u0012\u000f\u0011\u0011\nO\u001e \u0012\u0015\u0019\n\u0013\u000f\u0011\u0011\n\u0012\u0015\u0017\n\u0014\u000f\u0011\u0011\n\u0012\u0015\u0016\n\u0015\u000f\u0011\u0011\n\u0012\u0015\u0019\n\u0016\u000f\u0011\u0011\n\u001a\n\u0016\n\u0006\n\u0001\n$\nM\n\u0001\n3\n2\n-\n4\n.FEJDBUJPO\u0001CBTFMJOF\nBOE\u0001GPMMPX\u000eVQ\n\u001a\n\u0016\n\u0006\n\u0001\n$\nM\n\u0001\nD\nI\nB\nO\nH\nF\n\u0001\nJ\nO\n\u0001\n3\n2\n-\n4\n.FEJDBUJPO\u0001CBTFMJOF\r\nOP\u0001GPMMPX\u000eVQ\n\u0012\u0019\u0017 \u0013\u001a\u0014\n\u0012\u0011\n\u0011\no\u0012\u0011\no\u0013\u0011\no\u0014\u0011\no\u0015\u0011\nO\u001eRe f l u x outcome measure\n26\nThe performance of a measure may also be \nassessed by its acceptability to respondents. \nAlthough the R e f l u x  questionnaire has 31 items, it \nsuffered very few reported difficulties or missing \nitem responses within the R e f l u x  trial. During the \npilot, modifications were based on patient feedback \non the acceptability and readability of items. \nWeaknesses of the study\nThe most common method of establishing the \nvalidity of a measure is to analyse its association \nwith a criterion of known validity that is accepted as \na gold standard. However, there is no gold standard \nfor quality of life, or disease severity, in GORD \nby which to determine validity. Nevertheless, \nthe R e f l u x  trial does use SF-36 and EQ-5D, two \nreputable measures of generic HRQoL, although \nnot designed for use with GORD patients. As we \nhad used the EQ-5D VAS to generate the RQLS, we \nused the SF-36 to establish construct validity. The \nRQLS showed good correlations with the SF-36 \ndimensions of bodily pain and social functioning, \ntopics common to both measures, and weaker \ncorrelations with mental health and energy, topics \nnot included in the R e f l u x  questionnaire. We used \nself-reported change in medication to assess the \nsensitivity of the RQLS to change, which assumes \nthat changing from being prescribed medication to \nnot being prescribed medication necessarily shows \nimproved health status. \nThe second issue in establishing the validity of the \nR e f l u x  questionnaire is that the analysis was based \non patients with controlled symptoms, as one of \nthe trial inclusion criteria was reasonable symptom \ncontrol with medication. Thus, 10% of patients \nachieved the best possible RQLS at baseline, \nshowing that their GORD was affecting quality \nof life \u2018not at all\u2019, probably because medication \nprovided complete symptom control. There is \nscope to ameliorate these ceiling effects in future. \nThe final issue relates to the interpretability of \nthe five R e f l u x  symptom scores, derived through \nmultivariate statistical analysis. To interpret the \nresulting weights we have suggested five labels: \ngeneral discomfort; wind and frequency; nausea \nand vomiting; activity limitation; and constipation \nand swallowing. Although the first four are easy \nto interpret, the fifth contains only three items \n\u2013 difficulty in swallowing and two items relating \nto constipation. Although these appear to be \nheterogeneous, this is a common consequence of \nmultivariate analysis, which takes full account of \ncorrelations between items. Furthermore, these \nitems play little part in the other four dimensions \nand have been identified as potential side effects \nof surgical treatment. We have therefore retained \nthis fifth dimension, more to assess changes after \ntreatment than status at baseline.\nUnanswered questions\nThe aim of this component of the study was to \nvalidate a new measure of the HRQoL of patients \nbeing treated for GORD. Further evidence about \nthe performance of the measure will be available \nthrough detailed analysis of the R e f l u x  trial, some \nof which is described later in this report. Although \nour principal aim was to develop and validate an \noutcome measure for use in the R e f l u x  trial, we \nhope that the R e f l u x  questionnaire will prove more \nwidely applicable.

There are two broad \nclasses of treatments: those involving professional \nintervention (e.g. medicine, surgery, therapy) \nand those involving the adoption of different \nlifestyle behaviours (e.g. exercise, diet, stress \nmanagement). The Beliefs about Medicines \nquestionnaire (BMQ)93 developed by Horne and \ncolleagues assesses perceptions about one form of \ntreatment. The BMQ has been validated using a \nchronic illness sample (n = 524), including people \ndiagnosed with asthma, diabetes, renal disease \nand psychiatric illness, and cardiac and general \nmedicine inpatients. On the basis of principal \ncomponents analysis and confirmatory factor \nanalysis, four subscales were identified relating to \nbeliefs about medications specific to the diagnosed \ncondition (\u2018concerns\u2019 about taking the medication \nand \u2018necessity\u2019 of taking the medication) and beliefs \nabout medication in general (\u2018harmfulness\u2019 of \nmedication in general and \u2018overuse\u2019 of medication \nin general). The psychometric properties of these \nscales have been reported by Horne et al.93 and \ndemonstrate high levels of discriminant validity, \ncriterion-related validity and stability of the factor \nstructure across the different illness groups. This \nchapter investigates the measure of beliefs about \nmedicine amongst people with GORD and also a \nparallel measure of beliefs about surgery, in the \ncontext of the R e f l u x  trial. \nBecause the R e f l u x  trial involved non-randomised \npreference groups, it was felt important from the \nstart to include a measure that would investigate \nthe process of patients\u2019 decision-making about \ntheir treatment choices. Thus, this trial provided \nthe opportunity to answer three questions relating \nto beliefs about treatment. First, would baseline \nmeasures provide support for the validity of the \nBMQ for individuals in a chronic illness group \nthat was different from the groups investigated \nBackground\nThis chapter describes a study that was conducted \nin addition to the research activities described \nin the trial protocol. It is the result of discussion \namong the trial team in which it was decided \nthat it would be wise to check the validity of a \nquestionnaire measure that was devised specifically \nfor, and used for the first time in the context of, \nthe R e f l u x  trial. We have called this measure the \nBeliefs about Surgery questionnaire (BSQ). It has \nthe potential to be further developed as a tool \nfor use by consultants and surgical teams. In the \nsections below we describe the initial analyses that \nwere carried out to determine the validity of the \nmeasure. In the final section we suggest further \nwork that could result in the development of a tool \nto support communication between consultants \nand patients with GORD as they discuss treatment \npreferences and decisions.\nIntroduction\nCurrent health-care policy and practice \nacknowledge the importance of offering choice \nacross the spectrum of health care to users of the \nhealth-care system.91 It is plausible that people\u2019s \nchoices about treatment will be influenced by \ntheir beliefs about the risks and benefits of \nvarious treatments, which in turn will be shaped \nby their experiences or anticipated experiences \nof treatment processes. Indeed, this link between \nbeliefs (cognitions) and action is represented in \nLeventhal\u2019s common sense model of self-regulation \nin the face of a threat to health92 as follows. People \nappraise a health threat situation with reference to \ncognitions about the illness and then implement \ncoping procedures to restore their physical or \nemotional equilibrium. The model specifies the \ncognitive components of this appraisal process \nin terms of factors that have become known as \nthe illness representations framework.93 The \ndimensions of this framework include beliefs about \neffective treatment or control of the illness (e.g. \n\u2018taking medication will be effective\u2019; \u2018surgery may \nbe more effective than medication\u2019; \u2018recovery from \nsurgery could take a long time\u2019). A questionnaire \nmeasure about illness representations has been \ndeveloped and is frequently used to investigate Beliefs about medicines and surgery\n28\nin the original validation study, namely people \nsuffering GORD? Second, if participants were \nasked to answer questions relating to beliefs about \nsurgery (in the form of a BSQ), would their answers \nsuggest that these beliefs relate to professional \ninterventions in general (i.e. would the dimensions \nof the BSQ converge with dimensions of the \nBMQ) or would distinguishable factors emerge? \nThe answer to this question could be important \nwhen treatment options include both medical and \nsurgical interventions. Third, would data from \nthe BMQ and the BSQ, administered at baseline, \nprovide evidence of criterion-related validity? Such \nevidence would be provided if the profile of scores \non the BMQ and BSQ distinguished between the \nsurgery group and the medication group in the \npreference groups (the \u2018criterion\u2019) but not in the \nrandomised groups.\nMethods\nItem development\nDuring the development of the new GORD-specific \noutcome measure (the R e f l u x  questionnaire)24 \nfor use within the R e f l u x  trial as described in \nChapter 4, a series of one-to-one interviews and \nfocus groups were conducted involving a total of \n43 people (15 of whom were receiving medical \ntreatment and 28 who had had surgery). In \naddition to the relevance of these discussions for \nthe outcome measure, the feedback also suggested \nthat patients had a range of views about medical \nand surgical treatments and that they invoked \nthese views when discussing the decision about \nwhether to have surgery to treat their GORD. This \nsuggested that it would be informative to ask trial \nparticipants to report their beliefs about taking \nmedications and about having surgery. We decided \nto use the previously validated measure of beliefs \nabout medication93 referred to above, but no \nmeasure has been developed to assess beliefs about \nsurgery. We decided therefore that additional items \nto assess patients\u2019 beliefs about surgery should be \nadded.\nItems for a BSQ were generated in two ways. First, \nsome questions from the BMQ lent themselves \nto a directly parallel version referring to surgery \n(e.g. \u2018Doctors place too much trust in medicines\u2019: \n\u2018Doctors place too much trust in surgery\u2019). Second, \nadditional items were included as a result of \nanalysis of the interview data. Eight items were \njudged to be acceptable, answerable and relevant \nby this group. Similar to the BMQ, the response \nformat for these items was from 1 (strongly agree) \nto 5 (strongly disagree).\nTrial context\nAll 810 participants in the R e f l u x  trial were asked \nto complete the study baseline questionnaire. As \ndescribed in detail in Chapter 6, 357 were recruited \nto the randomised component of the trial and 453 \nto the preference study (261 of these choosing \nsurgery and 192 medical management). \nIn addition to the R e f l u x  questionnaire24 the \nbaseline questionnaire contained the EQ-5D88 and \nthe SF-36,89 and the BMQ and BSQ. \nAnalytic strategy\nTo achieve a clear replication of the original \nvalidation study by Horne et al.,93 the same analytic \nprocedures were used. That is, an exploratory PCA \nwas conducted on the BMQ items and confirmatory \nfactor analysis was performed by computing \nPearson\u2019s correlations for factor loadings against: \n(1) the theoretical model of predicted factor \nloadings; and (2) the empirical model of factor \nloadings reported by Horne et al.93 As described by \nHorne et al.,93 the theoretical model was defined by \nassigning a factor loading of 1 to all items expected \nto load on the factor, with all other items assigned a \nloading of 0. This strategy permitted a comparison \nof the expected pattern of factor loadings with the \npattern derived from the R e f l u x  sample.\nTo assess the level of discrimination between \nbeliefs about medication and beliefs about surgery, \na further exploratory PCA was conducted on the \ncombined items from the BMQ and BSQ using \na non-orthogonal (direct oblimin) method of \nrotation. The factor scree plot and eigenvalues were \nused to select the number of factors.\nFinally, discriminant function analysis was \nused to test the criterion-related validity of the \ncombined BMQ\/BSQ. This form of validity would \nbe demonstrated if the profile of scores from the \nquestionnaire enabled correct classification of \ncases to the surgery and medication groups in \nthe preference groups but not in the randomised \ngroups. \nResults\nOf the people recruited to the trial, 329 (92.12%) \nin the randomised groups and 419 (91.48%) in \nthe preference groups completed the baseline \nquestionnaire. Data from these 748 participants \nwere analysed in this validation study.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

Skewness was \ngreater than 1 for only two variables: \u2018My health, \nat present, depends on my medicines\u2019 (sk = 1.48); \n\u2018I would be willing to have an uncomfortable test\u2019 \n(sk = 1.09). Kurtosis was greater than 1 for six \nvariables: \u2018My health at present depends on my \nmedicines\u2019 (ku = 2.20, modal value = 1); \u2018Natural \nremedies are safer than medicines\u2019 (ku = 1.48, \nmodal value = 3); \u2018Medicines do more harm than \ngood\u2019 (ku = 1.81, modal value = 4); \u2018I would be \nwilling to have an uncomfortable test\u2019 (ku = 1.74, \nmodal value = 2); \u2018Surgery does more harm than \ngood\u2019 (ku = 1.10, modal value = 4); \u2018Doctors are \ntoo quick to suggest surgery\u2019 (ku = 1.40, modal \nvalue = 4).\nExploratory principal components \nanalysis on BMQ items\nBased on the structure of the instrument, as \nreported by Horne et al.,93 the BMQ was expected \nto comprise four factors (corresponding to the \ntwo subscales for each of the item pools relating \nto beliefs about general medicine and specific \nmedicine). Using an eigenvalue cut-off of 1.1,95 \nthe R e f l u x  data yielded three factors that together \naccounted for 48.99% of the variance in the scores. \nUsing a cut-off of 0.4 for item inclusion, every \nitem in the item pool loaded on to a factor and \nnone of the 18 items had diffuse loading. Factor \n1 corresponded to the combined \u2018general harm\u2019 \nand \u2018general overuse\u2019 scales of Horne et al.,93 and \nfactors 2 and 3 corresponded exactly to their \n\u2018specific necessity\u2019 and \u2018specific concerns\u2019 factors \nrespectively. Table 11 presents the item loadings \nreported by Horne et al.93 and the item loadings \nderived from the R e f l u x  BMQ data.\nConfirmatory factor \nanalysis on BMQ items \nTo test the consistency between the factor solution \nderived from the R e f l u x  sample and that of the \nchronic illness groups reported by Horne et al.,93 \na confirmatory factor analysis was conducted by \ncomputing the correlations between all of the \nfactor loadings derived from the R e f l u x  data set \nand (1) a theoretical model, defined by assigning \nfactor loadings of 1 to items expected to load on \na factor, or else 0; and (2) the empirically derived \nfactor loadings of Horne et al.93 The confirmatory \nfactor analysis was based on three factors (general \noveruse\/harm, specific necessity, specific concerns). \nResults of the confirmatory factor analysis are \npresented in Table 12. \nExploratory principal components \nanalysis on BMQ\/BSQ items\nA PCA (with oblimin rotation) was conducted \non all BMQ and BSQ items together. Based on \nthe structure of the BMQ for this sample, the \ncombined BMQ\/BSQ was expected to comprise \nup to six discriminable factors (corresponding to \nthe two subscales for each of general medicine, \nspecific medicine and general surgery). The scree \nplot (Figure 10) suggested that it was appropriate to \nextract five factors, which together accounted for \n50.95% of the variance in the scores. Using a cut-\noff of 0.4 for item inclusion, only one item in the \nitem pool did not load on to a factor and none of \nthe 26 items had diffuse loading. Table 13 presents \nthe item loadings reported by Horne et al.93 and \nthe item loadings derived from the R e f l u x  data. \nIn the solution for the combined BMQ\/BSQ, \nbeliefs about medicines in general again formed \none factor; the two factors relating to beliefs about \nmedicines specific to the reflux condition mapped \nperfectly on to the solution reported by Horne et \nal.,93 and beliefs about surgery also corresponded \nexactly to the pattern that was expected, based on \nthe findings of Horne et al.93 Beliefs about surgery \nappeared to be clearly discriminable from beliefs \nabout medicines, as all between-factor correlations \nwere less than 0.3 (Table 14).\nDiscriminant function analysis \nThe next question concerned the capacity of \nthe BMQ\/BSQ scores to discriminate between \nparticipants who chose to undergo surgery and \nthose who chose to remain on medical treatment. \nFive composite belief scores were computed for \neach participant, corresponding to the five factors \nin the combined BMQ\/BSQ factor solution. \nThe five variables were entered as independent \nvariables in a discriminant function analysis of data \nfrom the preference groups. This profile of scores \nresulted in the correct classification of 76% of the \ncases into surgery or medication groups. This was \nsignificantly greater than chance (\u03c72(5) = 178.93, \np < 0.001). In contrast, discriminant function \nanalysis of data from the randomised groups \nresulted in correct classification of 58% of the cases \ninto surgery or medication groups. This was not \nsignificantly greater than chance (\u03c72(5) = 6.68, \np > 0.05).

This afforded the most stringent test of the r e f l u x  model against the \nempirically derived model.\nDiscussion\nBaseline measures in the R e f l u x  trial provided \nsupport for the validity of the BMQ for individuals \nsuffering from GORD. However, the two general \nmedicine scales (labelled harm and overuse) \nmerged in this factor solution. It is possible that \nspecific characteristics of the sample may explain \nthis. For example, GORD is a condition for which \nmedication is taken symptomatically whereas the \noriginal validation study was conducted with people \nexperiencing chronic illnesses in which medications \nare taken continuously. This could have increased \nthe tendency of the GORD sample to discriminate \nbetween items relating to medications specific \nto the illness and correspondingly decreased the \ntendency to discriminate between the items in the \ngeneral medicine scales. Furthermore, all of the \ncurrent sample were trial participants and their \ninvolvement in the recruitment and informed \nconsent processes of the trial may have made the \nGORD-specific items more salient and therefore \nmore discriminable than the items about medicines \nin general.\nFIGURE 10  Scree plot indicating that a five-factor solution would be appropriate.\nImportantly, when participants were asked \nto answer questions relating to beliefs about \nsurgery, their answers yielded factors that were \ndiscriminable from those relating to beliefs about \nmedications, suggesting that these participants \nheld distinctive patterns of beliefs about these two \nkinds of treatment, rather than about professional \ninterventions in general. Furthermore, data from \nthe BMQ and the BSQ provided evidence of \ncriterion-related validity of the BMQ and the BSQ \nin that the profile of scores on the BMQ and the \nBSQ distinguished between the surgery group and \nthe medication group in the preference arm of \nthe trial but not in the randomised arm. In other \nwords, knowing nothing about the participants \nother than their BMQ\/BSQ scores allowed a \nreasonably good prediction of their treatment \nchoices.\nBeliefs about treatment have previously been \ninvestigated in relation to adherence to medication \nregimens but little research in this area has \nexplored the issue of patient choices about \ntreatment.

In addition, it may be that \na patient\u2019s score on the BSQ can provide important \nclinically relevant information. It is possible that \npeople with less negative beliefs about surgery \nexperience less anxiety associated with the surgery \nand, as there is evidence that anxiety is associated \nwith poorer clinical outcomes post surgery,96  this \ncould be important information for surgeons to \nbe aware of. Furthermore, it may be that knowing \nthe scores on these two questionnaires could help \nclinicians to counsel patients who have higher \nlevels of concern or to help patients make better \ndecisions about their treatment. It could be helpful \nto explore these possibilities in future research.\nIn terms of the common sense self-regulation \nmodel more generally, there is ample evidence \nthat people\u2019s illness perceptions influence their \nemotional and behavioural responses to an \nillness threat.92 Perceptions and beliefs about \nhow an illness may be controlled \u2013 including the \ntreatment options of medication and surgery \u2013 are \npotentially important factors that may link with \nother behaviours such as altered lifestyle. The \ndevelopment of additional measures that relate to \nother ways of controlling the symptoms of chronic \nillness could be useful in identifying people\u2019s \npreferred ways of coping with illness.\nIn conclusion, the perceptions of people with \nchronic illness about potential treatments can be \nmeasured validly and reliably. Core elements of \nthe factor structure of the BMQ (in particular the \ndistinction between specific and general classes of \nbeliefs) were replicated in this study. Furthermore, \nresponses to the BSQ indicate that beliefs about \nsurgery form a distinct pattern of treatment \nrepresentations and there is no redundancy \nbetween these two scales. Used together, the two \nmeasures can significantly distinguish between \ngroups of individuals who choose one form of \ntreatment over the other.Beliefs about medicines and surgery\n36\nImplications for \nfuture research\nAs proposed above, there is potentially important \nfollow-up work to be carried out in this field. Some \npossibilities that could be followed up using the \nR e f l u x  data set are:\nCan the correct classification rate be  1. \nimproved further by the addition of other \npatient characteristics, for example severity \nof symptoms at baseline, sociodemographic \nfactors, co-morbidities?\nCan the recruitment of participants into the  2. \nrandomised groups of the trial be predicted \nby using a discriminant function analysis as \ndescribed above to classify those who chose (a) \nsurgery, (b) continued medication, and (c) to be \nrandomised?\nDo underlying treatment beliefs modify  3. \ntreatment effects? If so, can subgroups be \nidentified who are more likely or less likely \nto respond well to alternative approaches \nto treatment, such as surgery or medical \nmanagement?\nCan the length of the questionnaire be reduced  4. \nwithout reducing its predictive power, for \nexample by using item response theory97  to \nidentify the discriminating items?\nAre these treatment beliefs stable or do they  5. \nchange over time or as a function of changes in \nsymptom severity?\nCould the questionnaire be adapted for use  6. \nas a communication tool by consultants and \nsurgical teams? \nIn conclusion, this work has thus generated a \nnumber of possibilities for continued work in this \nfield. It appears that the BSQ is a valid instrument \nthat has a number of potential applications in \nsurgical practice and research.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

Recruitment to the trial \nwas open from March 2001 until the end of June \n2004, although not all centres enrolled over the \ntotal period because of the staggered introduction \nof centres and early closure for logistical reasons in \na few places. \nInitial recruitment was limited to two centres \n(Aberdeen Royal Infirmary; St Mary\u2019s Hospital, \nLondon) and these acted as pilot centres whilst \nsystems for recruitment were developed. Roll-out \nof the trial to other centres started after 6 months \nT\nhis chapter describes the partially randomised \npatient preference trial that was the \ncornerstone of this project. The chapter starts \nwith an explanation of how the trial groups were \nderived. It then describes the study groups at \ntrial entry and the management that they actually \nreceived. The results at the two follow-up points \nare then reported, followed by a formal statistical \nanalysis of the data for the principal measures of \noutcome. \nTABLE 16  Number of participants by centre\n Clinical centre\nRandomised participants Preference participants\nSurgical, n (%) Medical, n (%) Surgical, n (%) Medical, n (%)\nAberdeen: Aberdeen Royal Infirmary 38 (21.3) 40 (22.3) 20 (7.7) 21 (10.9)\nBelfast: Royal Victoria Hospital 15 (18.4) 14 (7.8) 4 (1.5) 20 (10.4)\nBournemouth: Royal Bournemouth \nHospital\n4 (2.2) 3 (1.7) 20 (7.7) 3 (1.6)\nBristol: Bristol Royal Infirmary 12 (6.7) 11 (6.1) 18 (6.9) 20 (10.4)\nBromley: Princess Royal Infirmary 3 (1.7) 3 (1.7) 20 (7.7) 17 (8.9)\nEdinburgh: Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh 11 (6.2) 11 (6.1) 1 (0.4) 15 (7.8)\nGuildford: Royal Surrey County Hospital 10 (5.6) 10 (5.6) 17 (6.5) 10 (5.2)\nHull: Hull Royal Infirmary 7 (3.9) 7 (3.9) 1 (0.4) 2 (1.0)\nInverness: Raigmore Hospital 7 (3.9) 8 (4.5) 2 (0.8) 8 (4.2)\nLeeds: Leeds General Infirmary 1 (0.6) 2 (1.1) 10 (3.8) 3 (1.6)\nLeicester: Leicester Royal Infirmary 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 3 (1.1) 1 (0.5)\nLondon: St Mary\u2019s Hospital 8 (4.5) 7 (3.9) 4 (1.5) 10 (5.2)\nLondon: Whipps Cross Hospital 4 (2.2) 3 (1.7) 16 (6.1) 5 (2.6)\nPoole: Poole Hospital 10 (5.6) 10 (5.6) 25 (9.6) 13 (6.8)\nPortsmouth: Queen Alexandra Hospital 10 (5.6) 10 (5.6) 15 (5.7) 1 (0.5)\nSalford: Hope Hospital 0 (0.0) 1 (0.6) 6 (2.3) 3 (1.6)\nStoke-on-Trent: North Staffordshire \nHospital \n5 (2.8) 6 (3.4) 20 (7.7) 9 (4.7)\nSwansea: Morriston Hospital 8 (4.5) 8 (4.5) 14 (5.4) 9 (4.7)\nTelford: Princess Royal Hospital 11 (6.2) 12 (6.7) 24 (9.2) 8 (4.2)\nYeovil: Yeovil District Hospital 9 (5.1) 8 (4.5) 18 (6.9) 8 (4.2)\nYork: York District Hospital 5 (2.8) 5 (2.8) 3 (1.1) 6 (3.1)\nTotal 178 (100) 179 (100) 261 (100) 192 (100)Trial results\n38\nwith gradual extension to all remaining centres \nover the following 3 years. Figure 11 shows the \ntotal recruitment: the dotted line was the expected \nrate of recruitment over the last 16 months of \nthe trial based on earlier recruitment. As can be \nseen, it proved difficult to sustain recruitment to \nthe randomised component, although there was \nevidence for an increase in recruitment towards the \ntime of recruitment closing. \nA total of 357 participants were recruited to the \nrandomised component, with 178 allocated to \nsurgery and 179 allocated to medical management. \nIn total, 453 participants agreed to join the \npreference component, 261 choosing surgery \nand 192 choosing medical management. Table \n16 shows recruitment by centre. Around 20% of \nthe randomised participants were enrolled in \nAberdeen; no centre contributed more than 11% of \nparticipants in the preference component. \nAnalysis populations\nThroughout the analyses presented later in \nthis chapter the participants in the randomised \ncomponent are kept separate from those in the \npreference component (other than for rare surgical \nevents). Primary analyses of the comparisons \nbetween surgical and medical management in both \nof these components are based on the allocated \nmanagement at trial entry, that is, they are based \non the intention to treat (ITT) principle. This \nsustains the integrity of the randomisation in \nparticular. However, as described later in this \nchapter, a sizeable minority of participants did not \nactually receive their allocated management.

Of these, 200 were found not to meet \none or more of the eligibility criteria. Of the 68 \npatients eligible for the study but not recruited, \n51 declined to participate, 6 were subsequently \ndeemed inappropriate for the study by the surgeon \nresponsible for care, and the remaining 11 were \nmissed.\nIn total, 357 participants were recruited to the \nrandomised component, with 178 randomly \nallocated to surgery and 179 to best medical \nmanagement. A further 453 patients who wished \nto have one or other of the alternative approaches \nto management agreed to join the preference \ncomponent \u2013 261 to the surgical group and 192 to \nthe medical management group.\nIn the early stages of the trial a few participants \nfailed to return baseline questionnaires. After the \nfirst meeting of the Data Monitoring Committee, \nprocedures were changed to prevent this, such that \nformal entry to the study (and random allocation \nif appropriate) occurred only after full baseline \nquestionnaires had been received. The 1-year \nfollow-up questionnaires were received from \napproximately 90% of the study participants. There \nwere no substantive differences in response rates \nbetween the groups.\nThree participants died before the 1-year follow-up \nwas reached, two in the preference surgery group \nand one in the randomised medical group. None of \nthese participants actually had surgery.\nDescription of the \ngroups at trial entry\nSociodemographic and \nclinical factors\nRandomised arms\nTable 18 shows a description of the groups at \ntrial entry. The table is first divided into whether \nparticipants were in the randomised or preference \ncomponent, then divided according to their \nallocation, and finally subdivided according to \nintention to treat or per protocol. Within the \nrandomised groups there were no apparent \nimbalances between the medical and surgical \nintervention arms. On average the patients were \n46 years old, 66% were men and around two-thirds \nwere in full employment; participants had been \non GORD medication for a median of 32 months. \nThe baseline characteristics in the randomised per \nprotocol groups were similar.\nPreference arms\nThe sociodemographic characteristics of the \npreference participants were broadly similar \nto those of the randomised groups. However, \npreference medical participants tended to be \nolder (mean 50 years) and were more likely to be \nfemale, fewer were in full-time employment, and \nparticipants had been on GORD medication for a \nshorter period (approximately 6 months less than \nRCT participants).\nPrescribed medications\nThe prescribed medications at the time of trial \nentry are shown in Table 19. There was a similar \nprofile of prescribed medications across the \nrandomised and preference groups. As would be \nexpected, nearly all participants reported taking a \nreflux-related drug in the previous 2 weeks. Over \n90% had taken a PPI, of which lansoprazole was the \nmost common.\nHealth status\nRandomised arms\nThe HRQoL scores at study entry are displayed \nin Table 20. The scores were broadly similar in \nthe randomised surgical and randomised medical \ngroups, although they were slightly higher (better \nhealth) in the randomised medical group. As \ndescribed in Chapter 2, after the Data Monitoring \nCommittee first met after the first 143 participants \nhad been recruited to the randomised component, \nwe were asked to change the enrolment procedure \nto ensure that baseline questionnaires were \ncompleted before formal entry and randomisation. \nWe understand that this is because the committee \nwere concerned about an apparent imbalance \nbetween the randomised groups in baseline health \nstatus at that time. After satisfying themselves \nthat this was not due to a breakdown in the \nrandomisation procedure, the committee surmised \nthat this might be due to prior knowledge of \nthe treatment allocation affecting questionnaire \nresponses (with those allocated surgery tending \nto project worse health status than those allocated \nmedical management). Certainly, the groups based \non the first 143 participants were well balanced in \nother respects, and there was subsequently good \nbalance in health status as well. The apparent \nsmall imbalance between the total randomised \ngroups in health status measures is therefore likely \nto be a reflection of the imbalance in the first 143 \nparticipants.

The participants had lower SF-36 \nand EQ-5D scores than a normal UK population \nwith the same average age and sex characteristics \n(SF-36 population norm approximately 50 for all \ndomains, and EQ-5D norm 0.88).\nPreference arms\nThe preference for surgery participants reported \nworse R e f l u x  quality of life scores and worse health \nin general than the preference for medicine \nparticipants. It can be seen that the randomised \nparticipants reported quality of life measures in \nbetween these two extremes.\nSurgical management\nTable 21 gives details of the surgical management \nof those randomly allocated or in the preference \nfor surgery group. For 47 allocated surgery there \nwas subsequently a definite decision not to have \nsurgery. For 25 of these, this was a clinical decision, \nmost commonly the surgeon deciding that surgery \nwas not appropriate. Most of the others changed \ntheir minds about having surgery for a variety of \nwork- or home-related reasons, because of worries \nabout the risks of surgery, because of a wish to \navoid the preoperative tests, or because their \nsymptoms had improved. A further 20 withdrew for \nuncertain reasons. There is no doubt, however, that \na number of these participants suffered long delays \nbefore being formally offered surgery, and this was \nan important factor in their eventual decision to \nchoose not to have surgery after all. The trial was \nconducted at a time when there was great pressure \non surgical services in the NHS, with long delays \nfor elective surgery for non-life-threatening benign \nconditions being common. Indeed, the average \ntime between trial entry and surgery in the trial was \n8\u20139 months (see Table 23). \nIn total, 111 (62.4%) of those randomised to \nsurgery and 218 (83.5%) of the preference \nparticipants actually received surgery. Amongst \nthe randomised participants, about 50% had a \ntotal wrap and 50% a partial wrap fundoplication. \nA total wrap was, however, the predominant \nprocedure in the preference group (72.8%). \nThe difference between the randomised and \npreference group fundoplication procedures was \na reflection of the surgeon\u2019s preferred procedure \nand not any systematic surgeon bias between a \nsurgeon\u2019s randomised and preference participants. \nThis is illustrated in Figure 13, which shows that, \nwithin a given centre, the surgeon(s) performed \nthe same procedures on their randomised and \npreference patients. The majority of operations \nwere performed by a consultant and took around 2 \nhours to complete.\nIntra- and postoperative \nsurgical outcomes\nTable 22 shows the intra- and postoperative \nsurgical outcomes in the randomised and \npreference surgical participants who actually had \na fundoplication. Two (0.6%) participants out \nof the total of 329 participants who had surgery \nrequired conversion to an open procedure (95% \nCI 0.2%\u20132.2%), and 8 (2.4%) had a visceral injury \n(95% CI 1.2%\u20134.7%). One participant had a \nblood transfusion. Three were admitted to a high \ndependency unit, but none to an intensive care \nunit. Nearly all were discharged to their homes \nafter a median length of stay of 2 days. Three \nparticipants (0.9%) required a reoperation (95% \nCI 0.3%\u20132.6%) \u2013 all in the preference group \u2013 and \nthree had dilatation of an oesophageal stricture or \nfood disimpaction within 12 months of their initial \nsurgery.\nFollow-up at the time \nequivalent to 3 months \nafter surgery\nPatient flow\nAs mentioned earlier, around 90% of all \nparticipants returned completed questionnaires. As \nshown in Table 23, by the time of the first follow-up, \nsome participants had formally withdrawn, and so \nwere not sent questionnaires, and others had lost \ncontact with the study office. Of the participants \nfor whom it was appropriate to send a follow-up \nquestionnaire, approximately 95% returned it \n(Table 23). For the surgical participants, the median \nand interquartile range (IQR) time from surgery to \nthe first questionnaire was approximately 90 days. \nHowever, given that there were substantial waiting \ntimes for surgical participants, the median time \nfrom randomisation to sending the 3-month follow-\nup questionnaire was approximately 300 days (and \nthis implied a waiting list time of 8\u20139 months). The \nmedian lag time from randomisation to follow-up \nwas similar across all of the groups suggesting that \nour intention of pairing follow-up times between \nparticipants during the conduct of the trial (as \ndescribed in Chapter 2) was successful.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

For the RITT surgery group, 33.3% were \non a reflux-related drug compared with 92.4% \nof those randomised to medical management. \nWhen considering only randomised participants \nwho received the intended management (the RPP \ngroups), 9.2% of surgical participants and 92.7% of \nmedical participants were on a reflux-related drug. \nThe preference surgical and preference medical \nparticipants had a broadly similar proportion \non medications as the randomised surgical and \nrandomised medical groups respectively, although \nuse of anti-reflux drugs was lower in the preference \nsurgical ITT group than in the randomised \nsurgical ITT group (as would be expected given \nthat a higher proportion actually went on to have \nsurgery).\nHealth status\nThe health status measures at the 3-month follow-\nup are shown in Table 25. Within the randomised \ncomponent (RITT groups) there were clear \ndifferences across all measures, with the surgery \ngroup having better scores than the medical \ngroup. The differences were larger when only the \nper protocol participants were considered (RPP \ngroups). Details of the formal statistical testing of \nthese differences are described in the section on \nstatistical analyses.\nThe health status scores of the two preference \ngroups were more similar, although they tended \nto slightly favour the preference surgical group. \nOverall levels were equivalent to those of the \nrandomised surgical group. (It is important to bear \nin mind, however, that the baseline levels were \nclearly lowest in the preference surgical group \u2013 see \nTable 20.)

with the 3-month follow-up, of the participants \nfor whom it was appropriate to send a follow-\nup questionnaire at 12 months, approximately \n95% returned it (Table 26). The median lag time \nfrom randomisation to this second follow-up \nwas similar across all of the groups. It was also \napproximately 270 days after the 3-month follow-\nup questionnaire, further demonstrating that the \npairing of follow-up times between participants had \nbeen successful.\nMedications\nThe medications that participants had taken \nduring the previous 2 weeks at the time of the \n12-month follow-up are shown in Table 27. In the \nRITT groups, 38.3% of the randomised surgical \nparticipants had taken a reflux-related drug \ncompared with 89.6% of the randomised medical \nparticipants (and nearly all of these were PPIs). \nWhen considering only randomised participants \nwho received their intended management (the RPP \ngroups), 14.4% of surgical participants and 92.9% \nof medical participants had been taking reflux-\nrelated drugs. As at 3 months, the preference \nmedical groups reported similar patterns of drug \nuse to the randomised medical groups; however, \nthe rate of drug use in the preference surgical ITT \ngroup was about one-half of that in the randomised \nsurgical ITT group. Omeprazole and lansoprazole \nwere equally commonly reported and this contrasts \nwith the findings at study entry when lansoprazole \nwas the predominant PPI used.\nHealth status\nThe health status measures at the 12-month follow-\nup are shown in Table 28. Within the randomised \ntrial (RITT groups) there were still substantial \ndifferences across all measures (of the order of \nmagnitude of one-third or one-half of a standard \ndeviation of the score), with the surgery group \nhaving better scores than the medical group. \nThe differences were larger when only the per \nprotocol participants were considered (RPP \ngroups). Details of statistical testing of the health \nstatus scores can be found in the next section of \nthis chapter. For the reflux symptoms, although \nthere were improvements across all symptom \ngroups for surgical participants, the largest \nimprovement in symptom score was for the general \ndiscomfort dimension. A detailed description of \nthe responses to each symptom question is given in \nthe R e f l u x  questionnaire (see Appendix 2). These \nimprovements were also reflected in the SF-36 \nscores where the biggest differences were observed \nin the general health and bodily pain dimensions.\nFor preference participants the health status \nmeasure scores tended to favour the surgical group. \nHowever, the differences between the preference \ngroups were less marked than the differences \nbetween the randomised groups, mainly because \nthe preference medical group had better scores \nthan the randomised medical group.\nGraphical displays of the changes in R e f l u x  QoL \nscores and EQ-5D scores for all study groups are \ndisplayed in Figures 14 and 15 respectively. \nThree participants died, one in the randomised \nmedical group (road traffic accident) and two in \nthe preference surgical group, neither of whom \nhad surgery (alcoholic liver disease and cause \nunknown). \nStatistical analyses\nPrimary outcome\nThe pre-chosen primary outcome was the R e f l u x  \nQoL score at the time equivalent to 12 months \nafter surgery. The mean and standard deviation of \nthe score for each group at this follow-up are shown \nin Table 28. The differences between groups with \ncorresponding 95% confidence intervals are shown \nin Table 29. Three types of analysis are presented \nfor the randomised participants \u2013 intention to \ntreat, per protocol and adjusted treatment received. \nTable 29 also displays the impact of including \nadjustment for baseline score and randomised \ngroup \u00d7 baseline score interaction terms.\nIntention to treat\nFor the intention to treat analysis there was a mean \ndifference in favour of surgery of 11.2 between the \ngroups when only the minimisation variables were \nadjusted for (p < 0.001). This was not the most \nparsimonious model \u2013 there was strong evidence \nof an interaction effect between the randomised \ngroup and baseline R e f l u x  QoL score (interaction \nterm was \u20130.35; 95% CI \u20130.53 to 0.17; p < 0.001). \nThis implied that as baseline R e f l u x  QoL \nscore increased the treatment effect decreased. \nEstimating the treatment difference at the trial \nbaseline mean R e f l u x  QoL score of 65.4 resulted \nin a trial effect size of 14.0 (95% CI 9.6\u201318.4 ).

Addition of the baseline score and \ninteraction with the randomised group provided \nthe best model fit resulting in a difference in \nfavour of surgery of 18.4 (95% CI 13.6\u201323.2). \nSelection bias is to be expected in these estimates \nand indeed those who did not receive surgery in \nthe randomised surgical group had higher (better) \nR e f l u x  QoL scores at baseline than those who did \nhave surgery (69.0 versus 61.8). \nAdjusted treatment received\nThe adjusted treatment received analyses \nattempted to reduce the selection bias effect \ninherent in the per protocol analyses. The effect \nsizes using the adjusted treatment received \napproach produced slightly larger estimates \nof differences than the per protocol estimates \n(see Table 29); however, the confidence interval \nwidths increased. Nevertheless, the estimates \nand confidence intervals of the efficacy of the \ntreatments suggested large benefits of surgery.\nPreference groups\nThe preference for surgery participants reported \nconsiderably worse mean R e f l u x  QoL scores \nat baseline than the preference for medicine \nparticipants (55.8 versus 77.5; Table 20). Despite \nstarting from a much lower baseline score, at \nfollow-up at the time equivalent to 12 months \nafter surgery, the R e f l u x  QoL score favoured the \nsurgical group using an intention to treat analysis \n(difference = 3.9; 95% CI \u20130.2 to 8.0; p = 0.064) \nand using a per protocol analysis (difference = 6.3; \n95% CI 2.4\u201310.2; p = 0.002).\nSecondary outcomes\nThe secondary outcomes were the health status \nmeasures (EQ-5D, SF-36 and symptom scores) \nat the times equivalent to 3 and 12 months after \nsurgery. The use of reflux medication at 12 months \nafter surgery was also analysed.\nAt time equivalent to 12 \nmonths after surgery\nTable 30 shows the health status measures at \nthe time equivalent to 12 months after surgery \ndescribed by the same three analyses as for the \nprimary outcome (intention to treat, per protocol \nand adjusted treatment received). \nIntention to treat\nThere were statistically significant improved R e f l u x  \nsymptom category scores in favour of surgery \nacross all domains (with the exception of the \nconstipation and swallowing domain, which non-\nsignificantly favoured surgery). The bodily pain \nand general health scores had the largest SF-36 \nchanges (p \u2264 0.001); there were relatively small, \nnon-statistically significant changes in SF-36 role \nphysical, role emotional and mental health scores, \nalthough the directions of difference all favoured \nsurgery. The EQ-5Dindex score was also higher in \nthe surgery group, although the difference did not \nreach conventional levels of statistical significance \n(p = 0.07).\nPer protocol and adjusted \ntreatment received\nAll the per protocol analyses had larger differences \nthan the corresponding intention to treat analyses, \nbut the differences in SF-36 role physical, role \nemotional and mental health scores were still not \nstatistically significant. The adjusted treatment \nreceived estimates were broadly similar to those \nderived from the per protocol analyses.\nUse of medication\nThere were large differences between the groups \nin the numbers of participants requiring any \nreflux medication at the 12-month follow-up \n(Table 27). For the intention to treat analysis, the \nodds ratio of requiring any reflux medication in \nthe surgical group was 0.07 (95% CI 0.04\u20130.125; \np < 0.001) compared with the medical group \n(absolute difference 38.3% versus 89.6%). The \nodds ratios for the per protocol analysis and \nadjusted treatment received were 0.012 (95% CI \n0.005\u20130.029; p < 0.001) and 0.017 (95% CI 0.006\u2013\n0.048; p < 0.001) respectively. This is related to an \nabsolute difference of 14.4% versus 92.9%. Across \nthe 312 participants (randomised and preference) \nwho received surgery and completed follow-up, 37 \n(11.9%; 95% CI 8.7\u201315.9%) required any reflux \nmedication and 21 (6.7%) required PPIs.\nAt time equivalent to 3 \nmonths after surgery\nTable 31 shows the health status measures at \nthe time equivalent to 3 months after surgery \ndescribed by the three analyses (intention to treat, \nper protocol and adjusted treatment received). \nIn general, the scores were higher at 3 months \nthan at 12 months. The differences in EQ-5D, in \nparticular, were about twice as big at 3 months and \nwere clearly statistically significant at that time.

However, a sensitivity analysis removing \nthe data from the Aberdeen centre, the centre \nwhere the largest number of participants were \nrecruited, did not significantly change the \nconclusions (adjusted difference in R e f l u x  score \n+15.4; 95% CI 10.2\u201320.6). \nPartial versus total wrap procedure\nIn an observational analysis there was no evidence \nof a difference between a total wrap procedure and \na partial wrap procedure. The difference in the \nR e f l u x  QoL score between these procedures at the \ntime equivalent to 12 months post surgery was \u20131.3 \n(95% CI \u20137.9 to 5.2; p = 0.687).\nDiscussion\nThe trial provides strong evidence of improvement \nin GORD symptoms following laparoscopic \nfundoplication as judged by the R e f l u x  quality \nof life score and its constituent domains. There \nwere large differences between the randomised \ngroups in these respects at 3 months post surgery, \nwhich were broadly sustained 9 months later. \nAlso, scores in the preference surgical group were \nsomewhat higher than those in the preference \nmedical group despite starting from much lower \nbaseline levels. The estimated sizes of differences \nvaried depending on the assumptions being made. \nHowever, significant differences were observed \neven in the most conservative of the three main \nanalyses \u2013 that based on intention to treat \u2013 where \nabout one-third of those randomised to surgery \ndid not actually receive it. Similar differences were \nalso seen in most of the other measures of health \nstatus. There is, however, some evidence of a \nnarrowing of the differences when the 3-month and \n12-month follow-up results are compared. This was \nmost marked for the EQ-5D, in which the surgical \nvalues had decreased and the medical values had \nincreased somewhat (most easily seen in Figure 15).\nWe anticipated that this would be a difficult trial \nto deliver and so it proved. Trials comparing \nstrikingly different interventions (such as surgery \nversus medical management) are often a challenge \nto recruit to. The explanation of such a trial \nneeds to encompass a range of considerations \nand it is not unusual for some people, both \nclinicians and patients, to have strong views on \nthe alternative procedures. As expected, many \npotential participants did have preferences for one \napproach or the other, and it was partly because \nwe anticipated this that we included preference \ngroups alongside the randomised core of the study. \nBy enrolling surgeon\/gastroenterologist pairs who \nwere uncertain about the place of minimal access \nsurgery in this context, we aimed to avoid clinician \npreferences. However, the differential recruitment \nto the preference groups in the clinical centres, \nin part reflecting which clinician actually first saw \na potential participant, showed that there were \ndifferences in clinical perspective. This became a \nproblem within the randomised comparison on \nthe (relatively few) occasions in which a patient \nrecruited by one clinician was deemed unsuitable \nfor surgery by another clinician in the same centre.\nTo make the study more attractive to potential \nparticipants, those allocated medical management \nunderwent a review of their medication to \u2018optimise \nthis\u2019, rather than just carrying on with their existing \nregimen. This may be the reason why the types of \nPPI taken at follow-up differed from those at the \ntime of trial entry (predominantly lansoprazole at \nentry, but omeprazole or lansoprazole equally at \nfollow-up).\nPeople suitable for the trial were not easy to \nidentify. Most patients on long-term PPI treatment \nare managed in general practice, often through a \nrepeat prescription system. We used a combination \nof three approaches: retrospective case note \nreview to identify potentially eligible patients \nwho had been seen in a participating hospital; \nprospectively, especially through endoscopy clinics; \nand (in selected centres) advertisements to the \ngeneral public. All potentially eligible people had \nto be assessed clinically and they were only then \nformally approached about the trial. This was extra \nwork over and above normal clinical duties, often \nthrough specially established monthly clinics. As \ndescribed in Chapter 2, the numbers enrolled in \nindividual centres tended to be small, reflecting all \nof these constraints. In the event, we found that \nthose who agreed to join the randomised trial had \ncharacteristics mid-way between those of the two \npreference groups.\nWhat we did not predict were the long waiting \ntimes for surgery in many centres. This was \ndue to ambiguity about the responsibilities of \nparticipating hospitals in terms of the extra \ntreatment costs of surgery. The intention had \nbeen that surgical slots would be pre-booked for Trial results\n60\nthe trial and that participants randomised to \nsurgery would take the next available of these \nslots. In the event, emergencies such as cancer \ncases were given precedence, sometimes with \nrepeated postponements of R e f l u x  trial patients. \nAnecdotally, long delays were an important factor \nin the decision of some of those participants \nallocated surgery ultimately not to have surgery. \nDelays became intractable in a few centres to \nthe extent that special subvention funds were \neventually found to allow the operations to be \nperformed without any impact on normal clinical \nservices. The availability of such funds to all centres \nfrom the start of the trial would almost certainly \nhave overcome much of the waiting list problem.\nIn retrospect, given the long waits for surgery, it \nmight have been better following enrolment to \ndelay random allocation until there was a definite \noperation appointment. However, the likely impact \nwould have been significant uncertainty amongst \nthose enrolled about what they had agreed to, and \ngreatly reduced numbers actually randomised (with \nsome operations still postponed).\nThe standard rule in most trials is to time follow-\nup from randomisation. This was not appropriate \nin this trial because of the variable time between \nrandomisation and surgery, exacerbated by the \nwaiting list problem. The protocol specified follow-\nup at times equivalent to 3 and 12 months after \nsurgery. It was important to have follow-up in the \nmedical groups at equivalent times. We arranged \nthis by pairing surgical and medical participants \nsuch that follow-up was linked and at (about) the \nsame time after randomisation. The success of this \nmanoeuvre can be assessed in Tables 23 and 26.\nThe large number of participants who did not get \nthe management that they had been allocated to \ndid have an impact on the results. For example, \nonly 20% (10\/50) of those allocated surgery \nwho were taking reflux-related drugs at the \n3-month follow-up had actually had surgery. As \ndiscussed earlier in this chapter, we have gone \nto some lengths to explore the likely impact of \nthis non-adherence to the trial allocation. One \nway is through per protocol analyses limited to \nthose randomised who received their allocated \nmanagement. The second way is through an \nadjusted approach as a way of attempting to \ncircumvent the likely selection bias of per protocol \nanalyses. In this study the direction of effects was \nso clear, irrespective of the way that the analysis \nwas performed, that the main issue became the \nsize of effects. These did vary substantially (see, for \nexample, Table 29) and this could be very important \nwhen policy decisions are being made, for example \nin the context of an economic evaluation. The \napproach that we took to address this in our \neconomic analyses is described in the next two \nchapters. \nOne reason why we elected to have parallel non-\nrandomised preference groups was to get more \nexperience of the two forms of management. This \nparticularly applied to surgery. Complications \namongst the 319 participants who actually had \nfundoplication were rare (Table 22). Two operations \nwere converted to open procedures, there were \nsix visceral injuries and two pneumothoraces, and \nthere were three admissions to a high dependency \nunit with no admissions to an intensive care unit. \nPatients stayed in hospital for a median of only \n2 days. Three had reoperations and three had \noperations related to oesophageal stenosis. \nAs discussed in the following two chapters, an \nimportant measure of outcome is the proportion \nof patients continuing to take reflux-related drugs, \nespecially after surgery. Rates did go up somewhat \nbetween the 3-month and 12-month assessment. \nOur rate of 11\u201314% at 12 months is higher than \nthat in some other studies although estimates do \nvary both above and below this. Funding for this \nproject was for follow-up to the time equivalent \nto 12 months after surgery. We have, however, \ninstituted further annual follow-ups using similar \nquestionnaires to those used at 3 and 12 months. \nFurther follow-up will be important for assessing \nwhether the benefits of surgery are sustained or \nwhether differences in health status further narrow \nover time. We expect to report this after 5 years of \nfollow-up are available for all participants.\nThe next two chapters on the economic evaluation \nreflect the position that we are in currently, having \nonly 1 year of follow-up data, while recognising that \nlong-term lifetime effects are likely to determine \nwhether laparoscopic fundoplication is cost-\neffective. First, the within-trial cost-effectiveness \nanalyses reported in Chapter 7 are developed \nwithin an economic framework. Then, an economic \nmodel is used to explore and extrapolate cost-\neffectiveness over a longer-term perspective.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

There was a small amount of missing \ndata for use of medication, which was handled as \nfollows. If the patient confirmed that they were \nusing an anti-reflux medication but did not report \nthe dose, the median dose for other patients using \nthat medication was imputed. All patients were \nassumed to be on medication at baseline as this was \nan inclusion criterion for entry into the R e f l u x  trial. \nIf no medication was declared the missing data \nwere imputed as the mean cost per day. We assume \nthat all patients randomised to surgery undergo \ntheir procedure immediately and discontinue \nmedication at that point unless they declare use \nof medication at a subsequent follow-up. The total \ncost per patient of anti-reflux medication was \ncalculated using the trapezium rule using linear \ninterpolation between follow-up points.98,99 \nThe R e f l u x  trial recorded use of the following \nhealth services for the previous 3 months at first \nfollow-up (at a time equivalent to 3 months after \nsurgery) and second follow-up (at a time equivalent \nto 12 months after surgery): visits to and from \ngeneral practitioners; visits to outpatient clinics; \nand admissions to hospital during follow-up. These \nquestionnaires did not record use of health services \nbetween the third month and the ninth month. To \ncapture these data a postal survey of patients was \nundertaken in May 2006 asking patients about the \nuse of health services at any time during the first \nyear. The cost of use of hospital and community \nhealth services for each patient during the first year \nwas estimated as the greater of the sum of the first \nand second follow-ups compared with the use of \nresources reported in the postal survey. \nUnit costs\nCosts per patient were calculated by multiplying \nuse of health-care resources as collected in the trial \nby unit costs taken from surveys and published data \nsources (Table 32). \nIntroduction\nThis chapter presents the within-trial cost-\neffectiveness analysis comparing laparoscopic \nfundoplication with medical management. \nMean costs and health outcomes per patient \nare evaluated over 1 year using data from the \nR e f l u x  trial. The analysis is conducted from the \nperspective of the health and social care services. \nCosts are at 2006 prices and include the use of \nreflux-related health-care resources. Costs and \noutcomes are not discounted for this 1-year \nanalysis. \nMethods\nPatients included\nWe compare the treatment strategies of immediate \nlaparoscopic fundoplication with continued \nmedical management on an intention to treat basis. \nThe analysis includes data from 318 R e f l u x  patients \n(154 in the surgery group and 164 in the medical \nmanagement group) who were randomised to a \ntreatment strategy and who were followed up for a \ntime equivalent to at least 1 year after surgery. We \ndo not model the wait for surgery, that is, we model \na best practice situation.\nBecause, as described in Chapter 6, the \nmanagement of a high proportion of patients \ndid not comply with their randomised treatment \nallocation, we also conducted a secondary analysis \nof the use of resources, costs and HRQoL for \npatients who received randomised per protocol \ntreatment. However, it should be noted that \nthese data are potentially biased, as described in \nChapter 6. \nResource use\nThe use of the following health-care resources \nwas collected retrospectively from clinical \nquestionnaires for patients receiving randomised \nsurgery: the use of endoscopy, pH monitoring \nand manometry prior to surgery; the length of \ntime in surgery; and length of stay in wards, high \ndependency units and intensive therapy units post \nsurgery.

All rights reserved.\n63\nThe use and costs of consumable items and \nlaparoscopic surgical equipment was collected by \na survey in 2003 of five centres participating in \nthe trial, described in detail in Chapter 3 of this \nreport.100 This survey also estimated the mean cost \nper hour in surgical theatre in each centre, based \non the use of staff in each centre and national \nsalary scales.64 The mean unit costs estimated by \nthis survey were then applied to all centres in the \nwithin-trial cost analysis, updated for inflation.64 \nQuality-adjusted life-years\nThe outcome used in the cost-effectiveness analysis \nwas the difference in mean QALYs between \nthe treatment groups. HRQoL was assessed at \nbaseline and at each follow-up using the EQ-\n5D instrument. QALYs for each patient over \nthe year of follow-up were calculated as the area \nunder the curve using the trapezium rule, that is, \nassuming linear interpolation between follow-up \npoints. The difference in mean QALYs per patient \nbetween the treatment groups was estimated \nusing ordinary least squares regression, adjusting \nfor baseline differences in EQ-5D between \nindividuals. Bootstrap methods (resampling with \nreplacement)101 were used to estimate confidence \nintervals for the differences in mean costs and \nQALYs and the correlation between them. \nUncertainty regarding the treatment decision was \nrepresented using cost-effectiveness acceptability \ncurves.74 These show the proportion of samples \nfrom the data in which each therapy is the more \ncost-effective across a range of alternative threshold \nvalues that the health-care system may be willing to \npay for a QALY.102\nResults\nUse of health-care resources\nTable 32 shows the average use of reflux-related \nhealth-care resources in the two groups at 1 year \naccording to intention to treat. Nine patients \nrandomised to medical management underwent \nlaparoscopic surgery and 50 patients randomised \nto the surgical group did not receive surgery. \nAlthough the intention to treat analysis is unbiased, \nit is not very informative for describing the use \nof health-care resources, which depend on the \ntreatment actually received. \nTable 33 shows the average use of health-care \nresources according to the randomised per \nprotocol analysis. Patients randomised to and who \nreceived laparoscopic fundoplication spent an \naverage of 115 minutes in theatre and 2.4 days \nin wards postoperatively. Only one patient out of \n104 required the use of a high dependency unit. \nDuring the year of follow-up similar numbers of \npatients in each group required use of general \npractitioner services but patients who had surgery \ntended to require more outpatient visits and \nday-case admissions. At the 12-month follow-up, \n14 out of 104 (13%) in the surgical arm (who \nhad surgery) had used anti-reflux medications \nin the past 2 weeks compared with 144 out of \n155 (93%) in the medical arm who did not have \nsurgery. A proportion of those not reporting use of \nprescription medications, however, were missing \ndata, were using over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, \nhad stopped temporarily or had stopped for \nnon-reflux-related reasons such as pregnancy. No \npatients randomised to surgery required revision of \nthe fundoplication procedure during the year. \nCosts\nTotal mean costs per patient over the year on an \nintention to treat basis were \u00a31786 for patients \nrandomised to surgery and \u00a3506 for patients \nrandomised to medical management (Table 32), a \ndifference of \u00a31280 (95% CI \u00a31054\u2013\u00a31468) (Table \n34). The mean cost per patient of the surgical \nprocedure and hospital admission for those \nrandomised to and who underwent surgery was \n\u00a32012 (SE \u00a341) (Table 33). \nQuality-adjusted life-years\nThe HRQoL of patients, measured using the EQ-\n5D, tended to improve on average in the surgical \ngroup over the year of the analysis but not in the \nmedical management group (Tables 35 and 36). \nAfter adjusting for baseline differences in HRQoL, \npatients gained 0.066 more QALYs (95% CI 0.026\u2013\n0.107) during the trial period compared with \nmedical management using an intention to treat \nanalysis. \nCost-effectiveness\nThe estimated mean ICER is around \u00a319,000 per \nQALY using intention to treat (Table 34). Bootstrap \nsimulations were undertaken to estimate the \nuncertainty around the treatment decision. At a \ncost-effectiveness threshold ICER of \u00a320,000 per \nQALY, surgery has a probability of 46% of being \ncost-effective, and at a threshold of \u00a330,000 per \nQALY surgery is 86% likely to be cost-effective \n(Figure 16). This indicates that there is considerable \nuncertainty about whether surgery is cost-effective \nusing the R e f l u x  trial data.Within-trial cost-effectiveness results\n64\nT\nA\nB\nL\nE\n \n3\n3\n \nM\ne\na\nn\n \n(\nS\nE\n)\n \nu\ns\ne\n \no\nf\n \nh\ne\na\nl\nt\nh\n-\nc\na\nr\ne\n \nr\ne\ns\no\nu\nr\nc\ne\ns\n \na\nn\nd\n \nc\no\ns\nt\ns\n \nf\no\nr\n \np\na\nt\ni\ne\nn\nt\ns\n \nr\ne\nc\ne\ni\nv\ni\nn\ng\n \nt\nh\ne\ni\nr\n \nr\na\nn\nd\no\nm\ni\ns\ne\nd\n \nt\nr\ne\na\nt\nm\ne\nn\nt\n \np\ne\nr\n \np\nr\no\nt\no\nc\no\nl\n \na\nn\nd\n \nf\no\nl\nl\no\nw\ne\nd\n \nu\np\n \nf\no\nr\n \n1\n \ny\ne\na\nr\nM\ne\nd\ni\nc\na\nl\n \n(\nn\n \n=\n \n1\n5\n5\n)\nS\nu\nr\ng\ne\nr\ny\n \n(\nn\n \n=\n \n1\n0\n4\n)\nU\nn\ni\nt\n \nc\no\ns\nt\n \n(\n\u00a3\n)\nS\no\nu\nr\nc\ne\na\nU\nn\ni\nt\n \no\nf\n \nm\ne\na\ns\nu\nr\ne\nA\nn\ny\n \nu\ns\ne\n \n(\n%\n)\nM\ne\na\nn\n \nu\ns\ne\nM\ne\na\nn\n \nc\no\ns\nt\n \n(\n\u00a3\n)\nS\nE\n \n(\n\u00a3\n)\nA\nn\ny\n \nu\ns\ne\n \n(\n%\n)\nM\ne\na\nn\n \nu\ns\ne\nM\ne\na\nn\n \nc\no\ns\nt\n \n(\n\u00a3\n)\nS\nE\n \n(\n\u00a3\n)\nE\nn\nd\no\ns\nc\no\np\ny\n1\n7\n2\n1\nT\ne\ns\nt\ns\n8\n8\n0\n.\n8\n8\n1\n5\n1\n6\np\nH\n \nt\ne\ns\nt\ns\n6\n4\n1\nT\ne\ns\nt\ns\n7\n0\n0\n.\n7\n0\n4\n5\n3\nM\na\nn\no\nm\ne\nt\nr\ny\n6\n1\n1\nT\ne\ns\nt\ns\n6\n6\n0\n.\n6\n6\n4\n0\n3\nO\np\ne\nr\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \nt\ni\nm\ne\n4\n1\nM\ni\nn\nu\nt\ne\ns\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n4\n.\n5\n0\n4\n2\n0\n1\n4\nC\no\nn\ns\nu\nm\na\nb\nl\ne\ns\n8\n2\n5\n1\n8\n2\n5\n0\nW\na\nr\nd\n2\n1\n3\n2\nD\na\ny\ns\n1\n0\n0\n2\n.\n3\n4\n5\n0\n0\n2\n8\nI\nC\nU\n1\n4\n7\n0\n2\nD\na\ny\ns\n0\n0\n.\n0\n0\n0\n0\nH\nD\nU\n6\n2\n8\n2\nD\na\ny\ns\n1\n0\n.\n0\n5\n3\n0\n2\n9\nT\no\nt\na\nl\n \ns\nu\nr\ng\ne\nr\ny\n2\n0\n1\n2\n4\n1\nV\ni\ns\ni\nt\n \nt\no\n \nG\nP\n2\n4\n3\nV\ni\ns\ni\nt\ns\n4\n4\n1\n.\n1\n6\n2\n8\n5\n4\n4\n1\n.\n1\n4\n2\n7\n5\nV\ni\ns\ni\nt\n \nf\nr\no\nm\n \nG\nP\n6\n9\n3\nV\ni\ns\ni\nt\ns\n1\n0\n.\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\n0\n.\n0\n2\n1\n1\nO\nu\nt\np\na\nt\ni\ne\nn\nt\n1\n4\n2\n2\nV\ni\ns\ni\nt\ns\n1\n4\n0\n.\n3\n0\n4\n3\n7\n4\n3\n0\n.\n5\n4\n7\n6\n9\nD\na\ny\n \nc\na\ns\ne\n4\n6\n0\n2\nA\nd\nm\ni\nt\n1\n0\n0\n.\n1\n4\n6\n5\n8\n4\n2\n0\n.\n4\n7\n2\n1\n7\n1\n5\nI\nn\np\na\nt\ni\ne\nn\nt\n1\n3\n7\n8\n2\nA\nd\nm\ni\nt\n3\n0\n.\n0\n3\n3\n6\n6\n4\n0\n.\n0\n4\n5\n3\n7\nV\ni\ns\ni\nt\n \nc\no\ns\nt\ns\n1\n7\n3\n3\n8\n3\n7\n5\n4\n9\nM\ne\nd\ni\nc\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \nc\no\ns\nt\ns\n4\n1\n8\n3\n1\n0\n1\n8\n5\nT\no\nt\na\nl\n \nc\no\ns\nt\ns\n3\n5\n6\n4\n0\n2\n4\n0\n5\n6\n9\nH\nD\nU\n,\n \nh\ni\ng\nh\n \nd\ne\np\ne\nn\nd\ne\nn\nc\ny\n \nu\nn\ni\nt\n;\n \nI\nC\nU\n,\n \ni\nn\nt\ne\nn\ns\ni\nv\ne\n \nc\na\nr\ne\n \nu\nn\ni\nt\n;\n \nS\nE\n,\n \ns\nt\na\nn\nd\na\nr\nd\n \ne\nr\nr\no\nr\n.\na\n \nS\no\nu\nr\nc\ne\ns\n \no\nf\n \nu\nn\ni\nt\n \nc\no\ns\nt\ns\n \nu\ns\ne\nd\n \ni\nn\n \nt\nh\ne\n \na\nn\na\nl\ny\ns\ni\ns\n:\n \n(\n1\n)\n \nm\ne\na\nn\n \nu\nn\ni\nt\n \nc\no\ns\nt\ns\n \no\nf\n \na\n \ns\nu\nr\nv\ne\ny\n \no\nf\n \nfi\nv\ne\n \np\na\nr\nt\ni\nc\ni\np\na\nt\ni\nn\ng\n \nc\ne\nn\nt\nr\ne\ns\n \n2\n0\n0\n3\n,\n \nu\np\nd\na\nt\ne\nd\n \nf\no\nr\n \ni\nn\nfl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n;\n1\n0\n0\n \n(\n2\n)\n \np\nu\nb\nl\ni\ns\nh\ne\nd\n \nn\na\nt\ni\no\nn\na\nl\n \nm\ne\na\nn\n \nr\ne\nf\ne\nr\ne\nn\nc\ne\n \nc\no\ns\nt\ns\n \n2\n0\n0\n5\n\/\n2\n0\n0\n6\n;\n1\n0\n3\n \n(\n3\n)\n \np\nu\nb\nl\ni\ns\nh\ne\nd\n \nn\na\nt\ni\no\nn\na\nl\n \nm\ne\na\nn\n \ne\ns\nt\ni\nm\na\nt\ne\ns\n \n2\n0\n0\n5\n;\n6\n4\n \n(\n4\n)\n \nB\nr\ni\nt\ni\ns\nh\n \nN\na\nt\ni\no\nn\na\nl\n \nF\no\nr\nm\nu\nl\na\nr\ny\n \n2\n0\n0\n6\n.\n2\n0Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

First, which \nstrategy (medical management or laparoscopic \nfundoplication) is most cost-effective for the \nmanagement of patients with reflux who are stable \non medication from the perspective of the NHS \nand, second, what value there is in acquiring \nfurther information about these strategies.\nThis chapter presented the expected differences \nin costs and health outcomes between laparoscopic \nsurgery and medical management over 1 year \nusing the R e f l u x  trial data only. Surgery was on \naverage more effective (in terms of QALYs gained \nover 1 year) but more costly. The ICER of \u00a319,000 \nsuggests that laparoscopic fundoplication might \nbe cost-effective given that the threshold value \nin England and Wales is between \u00a320,000 and \n\u00a330,000.102 However, there is still considerable \nuncertainty about this result (probability that \nsurgery is cost-effective between 46% and 86%). \nThe main limitation, however, is that the within-\ntrial analysis ignores events, costs and health \nbenefits that accrue after 1 year. The benefits of \nsurgery are likely to be experienced by patients \nover the longer term,104 and the costs of medical \nmanagement, even with widespread use of \ngenerics, are considerable when continued over a \npatient\u2019s lifetime. Conversely, although no revisions \nof laparoscopic fundoplication were observed in the \nrandomised surgical group over 1 year in this trial, \nthe procedure may fail in the longer term.105 \nMore generally, new trials have to be placed in the \ncontext of existing evidence. Other randomised \ntrials, and observational studies, have evaluated \nthese strategies in the United Kingdom and \nelsewhere.

Therefore, the model \nhas been revised to define treatment failure in \nterms of change in treatment rather than return \nof symptoms.\nMethods\nModel structure\nIn the model patients follow a strategy of either \nimmediate laparoscopic surgery or continuation \nof medical management (without an option of \nsurgery following failure of medical management). \nIn principle, immediate open surgery is feasible \nin this patient group but it is not considered \nhere because it is widely considered to have been \nsuperseded by laparoscopic surgery, although \nconversion to open surgery is an option when \nlaparoscopic surgery fails. Patients are assumed to \nbe male and aged 45 when entering the model, \nwhich is the median age and commoner gender \nof patients in the R e f l u x  trial. Costs and health \nbenefits are discounted at 3.5% per year and the \nprice year is 2006.\nThe model structure is represented by Figure 17. \nAs mentioned above, we define treatment failure \nfollowing surgery as a change of treatment. Two \noptions are considered for patients who fail \nsurgery: patients may return to the use of anti-\nreflux medication or they may undergo a revision \nof surgery. \nIntroduction\nThe R e f l u x  trial compared a strategy of \nlaparoscopic surgery with one of continued \nmedical management for patients with reasonable \nsymptom control on anti-reflux medications. Data \nare now available from the clinical trial for at least \n1 year after surgery for all patients. However, as \ndiscussed in the preceding chapter, as reflux is a \nchronic disease, an analysis that considers only \nevents, costs and health benefits accruing over \n1 year is too restricted. To accurately determine \ncost-effectiveness, and the value of conducting \nfurther research, a modelling approach is required \nthat extrapolates costs and health benefits over an \nappropriate time horizon and allows the synthesis \nof evidence from different sources. This chapter \ndescribes a long-term decision-analytic model \nincluding evidence from the R e f l u x  trial and other \nsources. \nThe model presented here differs somewhat from \nthe preliminary model described in Chapter 6. \nThe preliminary model required evidence of the \nunderlying disease process, that is, knowledge \nof whether treatment failure was temporary or \npermanent. Further treatment, such as dose \nadjustment, withdrawal of medication or revision \nof surgery, was then carried out conditional on \nthe type of failure that occurred. However, in the \nreports from clinical trials, including the R e f l u x  \ntrial, the follow-up points are infrequent and\/or the \nunderlying disease is rarely observed or described \nconsistently. On the other hand, the treatments \nFIGURE 17  Model structure diagram.\n5SFBUNFOU\nEFDJTJPO\n4VSHFSZ %JF\u0001o\u0001BOZ\nDBVTF\n%JF\u0001o\u0001BOZ\nDBVTF\n3F\u000ePQFSBUF\n.FEJDBM\nNBOBHFNFOU\n.FEJDBM\nNBOBHFNFOUCost-effectiveness analysis\n70\nTABLE 38  Surgical patients requiring medical management: results of laparoscopic surgery arms of randomised trials or observational \nstudies\nStudy\nNumber \nof \nsubjects\nYears of \nfollow-\nup\nExposure \n(person-\nyears)\nNumber \nof failures\nRate of \nfailure per \nperson-\nyear\nProportion of \nfailures at end \nof study (%)\nMahon et al., 2005108 109 1 109 2 0.018 1.8\nBooth et al., 200242 179 4 716 19 0.027 10.6\nBammer et al., 200157 171 6.3 1094 24 0.022 14.0\nContini et al., 200238 103 1 103 5 0.049 4.9\nPessaux et al., 200245 1470 3 4410 60 0.014 4.1\nPapasaras et al., 2005 109 289 2 578 150 0.260 51.9\nGranderath et al., 2002110 27 4 108 2 0.019 7.4\nDassinger et al., 2004111 52 5 260 11 0.042 21.2\nBloomston et al., 2003112 100 1 100 19 0.190 19.0\nBloomston et al., 2003112 84 4 336 31 0.092 36.9\nVidal et al., 2006105 124 4.3 533.2 10 0.019 8.1\nMadan and Minocha, 2006104 100 3 300 80 0.267 80.0\nLaine et al., 199767 18 1 18 0 0.000 0.0\nre f l u x  trial, 2006 104 1 104 14 0.135 13.5\nAll studies 8769 427 0.049\nIt is assumed that patients randomised to receive \nsurgery who are found to be using medication at \nthe end of a clinical trial are doing so to control \nreflux symptoms or symptoms related to surgery. \nIt is further assumed that such patients will incur \ncosts of medication indefinitely.\nAlthough, in practice, patients who fail surgery \nmay recommence anti-reflux drugs followed by \nrevision of surgery, data on sequences of therapies \nwere not available and so these events are treated \nas mutually exclusive competing risks in the model. \nPatients are assumed to have the same prognosis \nfollowing revision as surgical patients who were not \nreoperated on. \nTo estimate the rates of return to medical \nmanagement and revision of surgery, all of the \navailable studies, whether randomised or not, are \ntreated as observational data. The rates of failures \ncould simply be estimated as the total number \nof events divided by the total patient years of \nexposure (Tables 38 and 39), which would estimate \nthe rate of return to medical management as 4.8 \nper 100 patient-years. This estimate ignores any \nbetween-study heterogeneity, which might arise \nfrom patient selection, definition of outcomes, \nstudy design, surgical technique or other sources. \nTo assess the assumption of homogeneity we also \nestimated the rate using a random effects Poisson \nregression using the statistical package WinBUGS\uf8e8 \n(see Appendix 11 for code).113 We also explored \nwhether any observed factors (length of follow-\nup, study design) might explain some of the \nheterogeneity, but these variables were not found \nto be statistically significant and were omitted from \nthe final model.\nA state of treatment failure for patients following \nmedical management is not defined because there \nis no feasible alternative treatment, that is, in this \nmodel (unlike the preliminary model), surgery \nis not an option for patients following medical \nmanagement. The estimates of mean HRQoL after \nsuccessful surgery and after medical management, \nand the standard errors, are those observed in \nthe randomised R e f l u x  trial at 1 year as there are \nno other randomised trials comparing surgery \nwith medication that have used a preference-\nbased utility instrument (see Chapter 6 for details \nof HRQoL data collected in the trial). HRQoL \nfollowing treatment failure is estimated by the \nmean EQ-5D of all surgical patients (preference or \nrandomised to surgery) who returned to medical \nmanagement or required revision of surgery by \n1 year. The base-case assumption in the model is Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

The age- and sex-stratified rate of death was \ntaken from life tables,115 assuming that this patient \ngroup has a similar life expectancy to the UK \ngeneral population after surgery. There is a small \nrisk of operative mortality, estimated in a literature \nreview as 4 deaths in 4000 procedures (see Chapter \n3).\nDuring the first year of follow-up, 35% of patients \nrequire an outpatient visit and 35% a day-case or \nhospital admission following surgery compared \nwith 15% who require an outpatient visit and 14% \na day-case or hospital admission following medical \nmanagement  (see Table 32; Chapter 7). The Nordic \nGORD study62 found that only a small proportion \nof patients required endoscopy after 12 months in \neither group, and here it is assumed that no further \nhospital admissions or outpatient visits are needed \nafter 1 year other than revisions of surgery. \nTABLE 39  Surgical patients requiring re-operation during follow-up: results of single arms of randomised trials or observational studies\nStudy\nNumber of \nsubjects Exposure (years)\nNumber of \nfailures Rate of failure\nMahon et al., 2005108 50 50 2 0.040\nBooth et al., 200242 179 716 11 0.015\nBammer et al., 200157 171 1094 5 0.005\nContini et al., 200238 103 103 0 0.000\nPessaux et al., 200245 1470 4410 35 0.008\nLaine et al., 199767 18 18 0 0.000\nre f l u x  trial, 2006 104 104 0 0.000\nAll studies 6495 53 0.008\nTABLE 40  Mean (SE) HRQoL parameters used in the model\nParameter Mean SE Source\nHRQoL following medical management 0.711 0.018 re f l u x  trial EQ-5D in randomised \nmedical arm at 1 year\nAdditional HRQoL following successful laparoscopic \nsurgery compared with medical management\n0.071 0.028 re f l u x  trial EQ-5D in randomised \nsurgery arm at 1 year (off drugs)\nHRQoL following unsuccessful laparoscopic surgery (on \nmedication)\n0.686 0.048 re f l u x  trial EQ-5D in all patients \nwho failed surgery at 1 year\nAverage HRQoL during year if undergoing re-\nintervention\n0.686 0.048 As for unsuccessful surgery\nHRQoL for general population aged 45\u201355: men; women 0.84; 0.85 Kind et al., 199971\nHRQoL for general population aged 55\u201365: men; women 0.78; 0.81 Kind et al.,199971\nHRQoL for general population aged 65\u201375: men; women 0.78; 0.78 Kind et al., 199971\nHRQoL for general population aged 75+: men; women 0.75; 0.71 Kind et al., 199971\nPrevalence of GORD in population aged 18\u201360 0.0045 McDougall et al., 1996;30 Trimble \net al., 1995114\nGORD, gastro-oesphageal reflux disease; HRQoL, health-related quality of life; SE, standard error.Cost-effectiveness analysis\n72\nThe model time horizon is a patient\u2019s lifetime. \nHowever, there are significant sources of \nuncertainty surrounding several model \nparameters given that the main source of data in \nthe model, the R e f l u x  trial, has reported only 1 \nyear of follow-up. To provide a point of reference, \nthe model analysis starts from a set of assumptions \nthat are similar to those used in the within-trial \ncost-effectiveness analysis presented in Chapter \n7, which assumed that there were no differences \nin cost or health benefits beyond 1 year. This \nis unlikely to be the case and so a series of \nscenarios that relax these assumptions is explored, \ndescribed in Box 1. \nOne way of proceeding with this analysis might \nbe to vary the time horizon over which the model \nis run, from 1 year up to a lifetime, in a series of \nscenarios; however, this would be na\u00efve. Reflux is a \nchronic disease and, therefore, the only reasonable \nanalysis is over a lifetime. The role of scenario \nanalysis is to explore different assumptions \nabout HRQoL, costs and clinical events over this \ntime horizon. The sources for the alternative \nassumptions are presented in Chapter 3.\nAnalysis\nThe model was implemented in R, a \nprogramming language,116 as a discrete-time \nMarkov model with a cycle length of 1 year. The \nmodel outputs were mean costs and QALYs in \neach treatment cohort. A probabilistic sensitivity \nanalysis was used to represent the uncertainties \nin the model inputs.117 Gamma distributions were \nassigned to the decrements in utility compared \nwith perfect health and the costs used in the \nmodel. Log-normal distributions were assigned to \nthe rates of surgical failure. Values were randomly \nsampled from these distributions in 1000 Monte \nCarlo simulations and these were used as inputs \nto the model to give 1000 calculations of costs and \nQALYs for the cohort. The ICER was calculated \nas the ratio of the difference in expected costs to \nthe difference in expected QALYs. The overall \nuncertainty in the treatment decision arising from \nuncertainty in the model inputs is represented by \nthe proportion of iterations in which laparoscopic \nsurgery is cost-effective, given a threshold value for \nthe ICER. \nResults\nBase-case analysis\nThe base-case analysis assumed that the relative \ntreatment benefit from surgery endured for a \nlifetime, provided patients did not experience \ntreatment failure. A summary of the assumptions \nused in the base-case analysis, and in alternative \nscenarios, is shown in Box 1. \nUnder base-case assumptions, surgery had an \nadditional mean cost of \u00a3847 and additional mean \nQALYs of 0.37 over the lifetime of the patients \n(Table 41), which generates an incremental cost \nBOX 1  Assumptions used in the within-trial analysis and alternative scenarios explored using a series of sensitivity analyses (see \nChapter 3 for data sources for assumptions)\nScenario number\nAssumption\nDuration of cost of \nmedication \nDuration of relative \nhealth benefit of \nsurgery\nAnnual rate of \nconversion from \nsurgery to medical\nAnnual rate of \nreoperation\n11 (within-trial \nanalysis)\n1 year 1 year 13% convert year 1, \n0.0% thereafter\n0.0%\n15 (temporary QoL \nadvantage)\nLifetime 5 years 13% per year up \nto year 2, 4.9% \nthereafter\n0.0% year 1, 0.8% \nthereafter\n16 (low rate of \nsurgical failure)\nLifetime Lifetime 4.9% 0.8%\n17 (base-case) Lifetime Lifetime 13% per year up \nto year 2, 4.9% \nthereafter\n0.0% year 1, 0.8% \nthereafter\n18 (very high rate of \nsurgical failure)\nLifetime Lifetime 13% per year 0.8%\n19 (high rate of \nsurgical failure)\nLifetime Lifetime 8% per year 0.8%Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

The analysis requires an estimate of the \npercentage of the population who would be eligible \nfor surgery if it were cost-effective. A Spanish \npopulation survey (both sexes, ages 40\u201379 years) \nfound that 287 out of 2500 (11%) interviewees \nused anti-reflux drugs, and 119 (4.8%) were stable \n(not having had reflux symptoms in the past year), \nalthough 43 (1.7%) acknowledged taking anti-\nreflux drugs to prevent symptoms.118 This might \nbe considered a conservative estimate of patients \nwho could be considered for surgery. If we assume \nthat about one-half of these might be excluded \nbecause of age, preference or co-morbidity, then \nprevalence is estimated at 1% of this population, \nequivalent to about 160,000 people in the UK.115 \nFigure 18 shows an estimate of population EVPI at a \nrange of values of the threshold ICER. EVPI in this \ncase is increasing with the threshold ICER because \nat higher values of the ICER we are more willing \nto pay for the health benefits associated with \nsurgery (and therefore more certain that surgery \nis the correct decision), but the consequences \nof a wrong decision are also greater (in terms of \nloss of health and wasted resources) and we are \nwilling to pay more to avoid the possibility of \nthese losses. Because the population is large, the \nmodel indicates that the EVPI is \u00a3300 million at \na threshold ICER of \u00a330,000, indicating that we \nwould be willing to pay up to this to eliminate all of \nthe uncertainty in the decision.\nFigure 18 also shows the partial EVPI for selected \nsets of parameters. Partial EVPI is greatest for \nthe rate of return to medical management post \nsurgery together with the HRQoL of patients who \nfail. This indicates that almost all of the variation \naffecting the treatment decision is due to the \ninteraction of these two parameters. Relatively \nlittle information is available on the HRQoL of \npatients who fail surgery; this could be captured in \na longer follow-up but does not necessarily require \na randomised trial. Figure 18 shows relatively little \nvalue of information in other parameters. However, \nthis analysis does not on its own capture all of the \nuncertainty in the decision for two reasons. First, \nwe have used mean estimates of HRQoL collected \nin a short-term trial to extrapolate over the longer \nterm, without adjusting standard errors to take \naccount of this additional uncertainty. There is, \ntherefore, additional uncertainty over long-term \ndifferences in HRQoL, which is not captured in \nthis value of information analysis. Second, we \nhave assumed that the pooled rates of failure from \nobservational studies of between 1 and 6 years are \ngeneralisable to our population, and that these \nrates will continue over the long term. We have \nattempted to represent this uncertainty as a series \nper additional QALY of about \u00a33000. Uncertainty \narising from imprecision of estimates of mean \nparameter values using base-case assumptions \nwas characterised using a probabilistic sensitivity \nanalysis. This showed that, at a threshold ICER \nof \u00a320,000, surgery was about 74% likely to be \ncost-effective. However, this underestimates the \nuncertainty because the base-case model assumes \nthe same imprecision about mean values of \nparameters for all years in the model, whereas the \ndata on HRQoL is available only for the first year.\nAlternative scenarios\nUnder the base-case assumptions, laparoscopic \nfundoplication is cost-effective compared with \nmedical management at a relatively low threshold \nICER. This is because we assume that, although the \nannual costs of treatment on medical management \nare relatively modest, these costs accrue over \na lifetime and offset much of the upfront cost \nof surgery. Furthermore, there is an HRQoL \nadvantage of surgery over medical management \nthat is assumed to persist in the long term. We \nexplored how alternative assumptions would affect \nthese conclusions using different scenarios (Table \n41). Surgery is not likely to be cost-effective if \nHRQoL after successful surgery is similar to that \non medical management after 5 years (scenario 15) \nor if the annual percentage of patients who restart \nanti-reflux medication after surgery is similar to \nthat observed in the first year of the R e f l u x  trial \n(13%) (scenario 18). \nValue of information analysis\nThe value of conducting additional research that, \nin principle, would reduce parameter uncertainty \ncan be estimated using value of information \nanalysis. The expected value of perfect information \n(EVPI) is the amount that a decision-maker should \nbe willing to pay to eliminate all uncertainty that \narises because of imprecision in the parameters of \nthe model. The partial EVPI represents the amount \na decision-maker should be willing to pay to \neliminate all uncertainty in individual parameters \nor a subset of parameters, given the uncertainties \nelsewhere in the model. \nTo illustrate this we estimated the EVPI and partial \nEVPI for five sets of parameters: (1) the HRQoL \nof patients who fail surgery; (2) the estimates of \nHRQoL for all other model states; (3) the estimates \nof the annual rates of failure of surgery; (4) the \nestimates of unit costs used in the model; and (5) \nthe rate of return to medical management post \nsurgery together with the HRQoL of patients Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

The question remains, however, \nover how long this follow-up should optimally be. \nDiscussion\nThis chapter has presented a decision-analytic \nmodel comparing laparoscopic surgery with \nmedical management, using data from the R e f l u x  \ntrial and other sources to estimate cost-effectiveness \nover a lifetime. The results of this model are \nsimilar to those of the preliminary model \npresented in Chapter 6, which indicated that \nsurgery was cost-effective but with a high degree \nof uncertainty. Other authors have examined the \ncost-effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery versus \nmedical management. Cookson et al.29 found that \nlaparoscopic surgery broke even compared with \nmedical management after 8 years and was cost \nsaving thereafter. Romagnuolo et al.28 evaluated \ncost-effectiveness over 5 years in a Canadian \nsetting, in which both surgery and medical therapy \nis on average more expensive (generic formulations \nwere not used in that model) than that found in \nthe R e f l u x  trial and by Cookson in a UK setting. \nThey concluded that there was little difference in \nHRQoL between the treatments and that surgery \nbroke even relative to medical management after 3 \nyears. Arguedas et al.119 evaluated the strategies in \na US setting with costs similar to Canada, assuming \na relatively higher rate of symptom recurrence and \nFIGURE 18  Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) assuming a population of 160,000 patients in England and Wales, and partial \nEVPI for three sets of parameters: (1) all HRQoL parameters; (2) HRQoL after surgery failure; and (3) failure rates for surgery.\nfailure of surgery, and relatively lower differences \nin HRQoL between the treatments, and concluded \nthat medical therapy dominated surgery using a \n10-year time horizon.\nAlthough surgery seems likely to be cost-effective \nin terms of expected (mean) costs and health \neffects, there remains considerable uncertainty \nabout this conclusion. Balances between risks and \nbenefits and between costs and health gain will \ndepend on patient characteristics such as age, the \npresence of serious co-morbidity and the severity \nof GORD symptoms. Furthermore, there are a \nnumber of practical issues to consider before \nthe NHS could consider offering surgery to a \nwider range of patients who are currently stable \non medical management. In particular, surgical \ncapacity and availability of trained surgeons are \npotential barriers to implementation and should be \naddressed.\nWe have estimated the value of reducing some \nof the model uncertainty in the analysis of EVPI \nand partial EVPI, and through a series of scenario \nanalyses. These have indicated that continued \nfollow-up of the randomised trial would be \nvaluable, particularly to obtain more information \non HRQoL following surgery failure and the long-\nterm difference in HRQoL between strategies. \nFurther research to obtain more information on the \nlong-term HRQoL and prognosis of patients would \nbe valuable. \n5ISFTIPME\u0001*$&3\u0001\tb\u0011\u0011\u0011\u0001\u00102\"-:\n\n&\n7\n1\n*\n\u0001\n\t\nb\nN\nJ\nM\nM\nJ\nP\nO\n\n\n\u0011 \u0012\u0011\n\u0012\u0011\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0013\u0011\n\u0013\u0011\u0011\n\u0015\u0011 \u0016\u0011\n\u0016\u0011\n\u0012\u0016\u0011\n\u0013\u0016\u0011\n\u0014\u0011\n\u0014\u0011\u0011\n\u0013\u0016 \u0014\u0016\n\u0014\u0016\u0011\n\u0015\u0016 \u0016 \u0012\u0016\n&71*\n1BSUJBM\u0001&71*\u0001\t)32P-\u0001BGUFS\u0001TVSHFSZ\u0001GBJMVSF\n\n1BSUJBM\u0001&71*\u0001\t)32P-\u0001TVSHFSZ\u0001BOE\u0001NFEJDBM\n\n1BSUJBM\u0001&71*\u0001\t'BJMVSF\u0001SBUF\u0001QBSBNFUFST\n\n1BSUJBM\u0001&71*\u0001\t)32P-\u0001BGUFS\u0001TVSHFSZ\u0001GBJMVSF\n\u0001\u0001\u0001BOE\u0001SBUF\u0001PG\u0001TVSHJDBM\u0001GBJMVSF\nHealth Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

It should be noted that \nthe utilities produced by the DCE reflect the \npreferences of people with GORD for the treatment \nand outcomes of GORD. As such, they are different \nfrom the utilities used to generate QALYs, which \nwere based on the responses to the EQ-5D \nquestionnaire and reflect the public preferences for \nthe outcomes following treatment of GORD. It is \nthese latter utilities that are arguably most useful \nfor priority setting within the NHS.102\nIn the following section a brief description of the \nDCE approach is provided. This is followed by the \nmethods used to achieve the aims stated above and \nthe subsequent results. Finally, a brief discussion is \npresented outlining the strengths and limitations of \nthe approach and the implications of the findings.\nThe discrete choice \nexperiment approach\nDCEs are based on random utility theory,121 \nwhich defines a set of assumptions about desires \nand transforms them into a demand function \ndescribing the actions of a consumer under a \ndefined set of circumstances. The following five \nstages are undertaken when a DCE is performed: \nIdentification of attributes (i.e. different  \u2022\t\ndimensions of the process or outcome of \ncare) that are potentially important to the \npeople with the condition under study. This is Discrete choice experiment to measure preferences for treatment options\n78\nIn addition to these five standard stages for a DCE, \na sixth stage, specific to this study, was also added. \nIn this stage the results of the DCE are combined \nwith data from the trial on the actual level observed \nfor each dimension for each treatment group. \nThis provides a summary score for each treatment \ngroup, the treatment group with the highest score \nbeing associated with the greatest benefit.\nMethods\nThe study was performed in two stages: a \nmethodological stage to develop the questionnaire \nand an applied stage to derive the utility estimates \nfor the different treatments and outcomes for \nGORD. \nIdentification of \ndimensions and levels\nAs reported earlier, a qualitative study was \nperformed to identify the potential issues related \nto GORD and its treatment that are important to \npatients (Chapter 4). The dimensions selected, \ntherefore, represent those issues that are concerns \nto patients undergoing treatment for GORD. \nSome of the identified factors were combined \ninto themes and, from these, four dimensions \nwere eventually defined. These dimensions are \nfrequency of troublesome symptoms, chance of \nserious complications, chance of undergoing \nsurgery and chance of needing lifelong medication. \nSeveral considerations were taken into account \nwhen identifying the levels of the dimensions. \nThey had to be realistic and they had to be set \nup in such a way that individuals could consider \ntrade-off between improvements. The levels of \nthe dimensions were derived from the trial data \nand discussions with gastroenterology experts. \nTable 42 provides a detailed description of the \ndimensions and levels that were used to develop \nthe questionnaire. \nWhich scenarios to present\nOnce the dimensions and levels have been \nidentified they are combined to generate \ncombinations of dimension levels referred to as \nprofiles. The four dimensions and four levels \nyield 246 possible profiles, too many to present to \nindividuals. Therefore, a fractional factorial design \nwas used to reduce the profiles to a manageable \nlevel while still being able to infer utilities for \nall possible profiles. Existing literature suggests \nthat individuals can manage between 9 and 16 \npairwise comparisons before they become bored \nor tired.123 The identified design had 16 profiles \nand they were randomly split into two different \nquestionnaires containing 8 questions (see \nAppendix 12). The design was derived from a web-\nbased catalogue.124\u2013126\nAlthough profiles from fractional factorial designs \nhave statistical properties for the estimation of \nparameters of general linear models, we needed \nto ensure that the choice sets generated from \nthese profiles were statistically efficient. Therefore, \ntests for the properties of an efficient design were \nperformed. The properties of an efficient design \ninclude:\nLevel balance \u2022\t  \u2013 this occurs when the levels of a \ndimension occur with equal frequency. \nOrthogonality \u2022\t  \u2013 this is satisfied when dimension \nlevels are not correlated, that is, the joint \noccurrence of any two levels of different \ndimensions appears in profiles with a \nfrequency that is equal to the product of their \nmarginal frequencies (Addelman 1962, cited \nin Zwerina et al., 1996126). Therefore, the \nlevels of dimensions appear in choice sets with \nequal frequency to each level of each other \ndimension. \nMinimum overlap \u2022\t  \u2013 this means that the \nprobability that a dimension level repeats \nitself in each choice set should be as small as \npossible, especially in instances when there is \nmore than one choice, e.g. choice A and choice \nB. This is an important issue as the differences \nin dimension levels are only useful within a \nchoice set if the respondents trade these levels. \nWhen this property is violated the choice sets \nprovide no information on the dimension\u2019s \nvalue. \nThe set of alternatives is typically the same for all \nsubjects and the explanatory variables are all choice \nspecific. Individuals were asked to make a number \nof such choices, and using the responses from these \nthe preferences for alternative profiles could be \nelicited. \nEliciting preferences\nOnce the scenarios to be presented to patients were \nidentified, preferences for these scenarios were \nobtained by using a forced choice approach. An \nexample of the choices presented to participants is \nshown in Figure 19; respondents were asked which \noption they would choose, \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019.

These symptoms could include \nheartburn (a burning sensation that moves up the chest), acid reflux (an acid taste in mouth), \nexcessive wind in lower bowel or trapped in stomach, difficulty eating and swallowing food, \ntroublesome bowel movements (diarrhoea\/constipation), and experiencing difficulty with lying \ndown or getting to sleep\nNot at all\nOnce a week\nTwo or three times a week\nMost days or every day\nChance of serious complications requiring hospitalisation  This aspect refers to the \npossibility that you may experience complications\/side effects as a result of your GORD \ntreatment. These complications\/side effects could lead to you spending a few days in hospital. \nThey could include bleeding that could lead to anaemia, scarring of the oesophagus, or \ndifficulty or pain when swallowing\n1 in 800 (0.1%) people\n1 in 500 (0.2%) people\n1 in 300 (0.3%) people\n1 in 100 (1%) people\nChance of undergoing surgery  This aspect describes the chance that you might have to \nundergo any surgery to treat your GORD symptoms\n1 in 20 (5%) people\n1 in 3 (33%) people\n2 in 3 (66%) people\n5 in 6 (83%) people\nChance of needing lifelong medication  This aspect describes the chance that you might \nhave to take medication (e.g. PPIs) over a long period of time (months or years) for GORD\n1 in 20 (5%) people\n1 in 3 (33%) people\n2 in 3 (66%) people\n5 in 6 (83%) people\nGORD, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease; PPI, proton pump inhibitor.\nFIGURE 19  Example of discrete choice experiment question presented to trial participants.\nChoice 1  Which option would you choose?\nOption A Option B\nFrequency of troublesome symptoms Most days or \nevery day\nNot at all\nChance of serious complications requiring hospitalisation 1 in 500 1 in 300\nChance of undergoing surgery 1 in 3 2 in 3\nChance of needing lifelong medication 5 in 6  1  in 20\n(Tick one box only)\noption A option B\nOne important issue in preference elicitation is \nwhose preferences should be elicited. Patients with \nthe experience of both disease and treatment were \nconsidered appropriate for this study and therefore \nthe completed questionnaire was sent to all active \nparticipants in the R e f l u x  trial during August 2006. \nPiloting the questionnaire\nThe sample for piloting the questionnaire \nwas obtained from individuals attending a \ngastroenterology clinic in Aberdeen. Patients \nwere screened by a clinician and those assessed as \nhaving GORD were asked to complete the DCE Discrete choice experiment to measure preferences for treatment options\n80\nquestionnaire with a researcher (LV). The aim of \nthe pilot work was to ensure that the guidance \nnotes provided with the questionnaire were clear \nand that patients could understand them and \nthat they were able to perform the task of making \nchoices. The respondents were asked to complete \nthe questionnaire using the guidance information \nprovided and they were then asked about its \nreadability and acceptability. They indicated \nthat the guidance notes were clear and easy to \nunderstand and that they were able to answer the \nquestions without much difficulty. \nConsistency of responses\nAn important aspect of a DCE is that respondents \nshould behave in a rational manner when making \nchoices. Rationality within DCEs is mainly tested \nusing non-satiation (dominance) tests. These tests \nare, however, perceived as easy to satisfy.120 For \nthis reason more sophisticated expansion property \ntests were conducted.127 This involved adding two \nconsistency questions to the questionnaire. \nRespondents were first asked to choose the worse \nof two situations (A or B). In the consistency \nquestion, which was presented as a non-consecutive \nquestion, this choice was widened to a set of three \nsituations (A, B or C). As with the simple two \nsituation question, respondents were asked to \nchoose one of the three situations (see example of \nboth questionnaires in Appendix 12). A respondent \nwas believed to behave rationally if the choice \nthey made in the two situation question did not \nconflict with the choice they made when faced with \nthe three situation question. For example, if the \nrespondent choose situation B in the first choice \nset, then they should not choose situation A in the \nexpanded choice set. Similarly, if the respondent \nchose situation A in the first choice set, then they \nshould not choose situation B in the expanded \nchoice set. \nA sensitivity analysis was performed that excluded \nthose respondents who failed the consistency test \n(i.e. they gave an inconsistent response in both \nconsistency questions). \nEstimating utilities\nTo establish the importance of the various \ndimensions, the relationship between the \ndimensions and utility must be specified. The \nlinear additive model assumes that the overall \nvaluation or utility derived from any combination \nof dimensions is given by the sum of the values \nof the separate dimensions. In this model the \nreference group for the modelling analysis was \nthe best level of each dimension. This means that \nthe results from the DCE will be able to illustrate \nhow the different combinations of dimensions and \nlevels compare with the best possible combination \nof dimensions and levels from the DCE.\nThe linear additive model for a simple model was \nspecified as: \nU = \u03b21frequency + \u03b22frequency + \u03b23frequency + \n\u03b24serious complications + \u03b25surgery + \u03b26lifelong \nmedication\nwhere \u2018U\u2019 is the utility or preference score for an \noutcome with a given level of each dimension; \n\u2018frequency\u2019 is the occurrence of troublesome \nsymptoms and, as it was a categorical variable, \ndummy values were used for the analysis for \neach level; \u2018serious complications\u2019 is the chance \nof complications requiring hospitalisation; \n\u2018surgery\u2019 is the chance of undergoing surgery; \nand \u2018lifelong medication\u2019 is the chance of needing \nlifelong medication. The parameters \u03b21\u2013\u03b26 are the \ncoefficients of the model to be estimated. \nThe coefficients indicate the relative importance, \nor weight, of a unit change in that dimension \nin terms of overall benefit. The rate at which \nrespondents are willing to trade between these \ndimensions (i.e. how much of the dimension they \nare willing to give up for improvements in other \ndimensions) is shown by the ratio of the coefficients \n(i.e. the marginal rate of substitution). For example, \n\u03b25\/\u03b26 indicates how much of a change in the chance \nof having lifelong medication would be required \nif there was a 10% change in the chance of having \nsurgery so that overall utility remains constant.\nThe internal validity (the extent to which the \nresults are consistent with economic theory or a \npriori expectations) of the DCE can be determined \nby the results from the regression analysis. Given \nthat the higher the chance an episode will be \nexperienced, the less it will be preferred, we \nanticipated that the dimensions would have a \nnegative sign in the regression equation. \nEconometric techniques were used to analyse the \nDCE responses and to estimate a value such that \nthe utility weights could be estimated for all of the \noutcomes in the instrument. As described above, \nthe best level was used as the comparator for all \ndimensions. As participants provided multiple \nresponses, a conditional fixed-effects logistic \nregression model was used to analyse the response \ndata. Two models were estimated: a main model Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008. All rights reserved.\n81\nthat measured preferences across the whole group \nand a further model that was used to establish \nwhether the responses of individuals differed based \nupon the trial group to which they belonged. \nAlthough it would be possible to estimate a \nregression model for each arm of the study (i.e. \nto estimate four separate models), it would not \nbe appropriate to make comparisons between the \nmodels. A more appropriate way of considering \nthe effect that people\u2019s initial preferences for a \nparticular treatment have on the choices they \nmake when responding to the DCE is to include \ninteraction terms to explore the extent to which \nthe preferences of those in the two preference \narms differed. Interaction terms were included \nto explore whether the preferences of specific \ngroups (e.g. preferred medicine, preferred surgery, \nrandomised surgery, randomised medicine) for \neach dimension included in the model differed \nfrom the preferences of the whole model. \nSensitivity analyses\nThe analyses described above included all \nresponses, even those for which there was evidence \nthat the responses were not consistent. Therefore, \nin a first sensitivity analysis the effect of excluding \nthe inconsistent responses from the main model \nwas investigated.\nThe methods described above involve making the \nassumption that preferences for a unit change in \nrisk are independent of the scale of that risk (i.e. \na 10% change in risk from 4% to 14% would be \nvalued the same as a 10% change in risk from 70% \nto 80%). To investigate whether it was appropriate \nto assume a linear relationship between the levels \nof each dimension, a quadratic variable (surgery 1, \nlifelong medicines 1,  and serious complications 1) \nwas included for each dimension. \nCalculation of utilities for \neach treatment group\nThe results of the econometric analyses can \nbe used to estimate a utility score. This can be \naccomplished by combining the information on \nthe levels for each dimension, which was derived \ndirectly from the trial, with the coefficient for that \ndimension. Table 43 gives an example of how a \nutility might be calculated for hypothetical levels \nand coefficients.\nSimilar scores can be calculated for data taken from \neach arm of the trial. The scores from the different \narms could be compared relative to each other (i.e. \nthe ratio of the scores from two groups), but, to aid \nthis comparison, a score has been estimated for \nboth the worst possible and the best case situation \n(which is by definition 0). Using the coefficient \nvalues from Table 43, and assuming that people \nexperienced the worst level of each dimension (i.e. \nsymptoms most days\/every day, 100% chance of \nsurgery, lifelong medications and a hypothetical \nmaximum of 10% for complications), the worst case \nscenario would be associated with a score of \u2013210. \nTherefore, if the worst case scenario was rescaled \nto 0, then the best case scenario would equal +210 \nand the state described in Table 43 would have \na score of 175 (i.e. 210\u201335). As a consequence it \ncan be seen that the state described in Table 43 is \nequivalent to 0.833 (i.e. 175\/210) of the utility of \nthe hypothetical best case scenario. \nSelection of respondents\nThe sample of respondents used in this DCE was \nmade up of R e f l u x  trial participants. They were \nconsidered to be the appropriate group as they \nhad already undergone treatment. As described \nin earlier chapters, the trial was composed of four \narms: two arms involved the randomisation of \nTABLE 43  Example of the calculation of a utility score from the results of a discrete choice experiment\nDimension Coefficient Actual level (%) Utility\nTroublesome symptoms\n  None 0.00 (baseline) 60 0.00\n  Once a week \u20130.05 20 \u20131.00\n  Two\/three times a week \u20130.20 15 \u20133.00\n  Most days\/every day \u20130.40 5 \u20132.00\nSerious complications \u20131.00 per 0.1% change 0.1 \u20131.00\nSurgery \u20135.00 per 10% change 40 \u201320.00\nLifelong medication \u20132.00 per 10% change 40 \u20138.00\nTotal score \u201335.00Discrete choice experiment to measure preferences for treatment options\n82\nindividuals to either medical or surgical treatment \nand the other two arms included those who \nhad expressed a preference for either medical \nmanagement or surgical treatment.\nResults\nOf the 705 questionnaires sent out, 441 (63%) were \nreturned; 17(3%) were returned uncompleted and \n424 (60%) were fully or partially completed. Of \nthese 424 questionnaires, 87 (21%) were from the \nrandomised surgical group, 103 (24%) were from \nthe randomised medical group, and 109 (26%) and \n125 (29%) were from the preference medical and \npreference surgical groups respectively.\nConsistency of responses\nTen (2%) people failed to answer the two \nconsistency test questions consistently and so \nwere excluded when the sensitivity analysis was \nperformed. \nEconometric analysis \nThe conditional logistic regression analysis was \nbased on all of the respondents who returned \ncompleted questionnaires. Out of a possible 6784 \n(424 \u00d7 16) observations from the 424 completed \nand partially completed questionnaires, there were \n6434 observations and 350 missing responses. Of \nthese 6434 observations, 1392 (21%) were from the \nrandomised surgical group, 1648 (24%) were from \nthe randomised medical group, and 1744 (26%) \nand 2000 (29%) were from the preference medical \nand preference surgical groups respectively.\nA sensitivity analysis performed after excluding the \nten respondents who had failed both consistency \ntests was based on 6274 observations from 414 \nrespondents. \nAnalysis based on the whole sample \nincluding inconsistent responses\nThe sign of the coefficient indicates the direction of \nthe influence of preferences. All other things being \nequal, a higher negative coefficient indicates a \nhigher negative influence on the overall preference \n(see Appendix 13). The regression coefficients all \nhad the expected sign (negative) and decreased \nas expected (i.e. as more difficulty is experienced, \nthe coefficient becomes larger). There was no \nstatistically significant difference between the first \ntwo levels for the first dimension, frequency of \ntroublesome symptoms. Therefore, in subsequent \nanalyses these two levels were combined. \nThe results of the regression model in which \nthe first two levels for frequency of troublesome \nsymptoms were combined are presented in Table \n44, and the results of the initial regression model \nin which the levels for frequency of troublesome \nsymptoms were not combined are presented in \nAppendix 13. \nThe absolute importance of the parameters \nincluded in the analysis can be established by \ncomparing the sizes of the regression coefficients. \nAs Table 44 illustrates, the most important factor \nwas serious complications with a coefficient of \n\u20135.454, indicating that respondents experienced \ngreater disutility for a unit increase (i.e. a 0.1% \nincrease) in the probability of occurrence of serious \ncomplications than for a unit change in any other \nfactor. The chance of undergoing surgery (\u20135.212 \nper 10% change), the chance of having lifelong \nmedications (\u20134.797 per 10% change) and the \nchance of having troublesome symptoms most days\/\nevery day (\u20131.130 per 10% change) were the next \nlargest dimensions.\nTABLE 44  The regression model for the whole sample with the first two levels for frequency of troublesome symptoms combined\nDimension Coefficient Standard error p-value 95% CI\nTroublesome symptoms\nTwo or three times a week \u20130.397 0.061 0.000 \u20130.516 to \u20130.277\nMost days\/every day \u20131.130 0.065 0.000 \u20131.258 to \u20131.001\nSerious complications \u20135.454 0.661 0.000 \u20136.750 to \u20134.158\nSurgery \u20135.212 0.845 0.000 \u20136.868 to \u20133.556\nLifelong medication \u20134.797 0.685 0.000 \u20136.139 to \u20133.455\nCI, confidence interval.\nConditional (fixed-effects) logistic regression: number of obs = 6434, LR \u03c72(5) = 491, prob > \u03c72 = 0.0000.\nLog likelihood = \u20131984.3546, pseudo r2 = 0.1101.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

Similar rates were calculated \nfor a 10% change in the risks of surgery and \nlifelong medication, which were 1.3 times and 1.2 \ntimes as important respectively (a full description \nof marginal rates of substitution between all \ncoefficients is provided in Appendix 13).\nAnalysis to investigate whether \npreferences differ between the \nfour groups of the r e f l u x  trial\nFurther analysis was performed to establish the \neffect of the treatment group that patients were \nassigned to, either through their own preferences \nor through randomisation. There was no evidence \nof any differences in preferences in the four \ntreatment groups for either troublesome symptoms \nor serious complications. However, as would be \nanticipated, preferences did differ for surgery \nand lifelong medications. The exception to this \nwas that there was no evidence of a statistically \nsignificant difference in the preferences for \nlifelong medication amongst those people that had \nexpressed a preference for medication compared \nwith the preferences from the whole sample. \nThe results of the analysis investigating whether \npreferences varied between treatment groups \nis reported in Table 45 (interaction terms for \ntroublesome symptoms or serious complications \nhave been omitted as they were not statistically \nsignificant). \nAs would be expected, the results of this analysis \nindicate that people who expressed a preference \nfor one treatment would experience a further \nloss of utility if they received the other treatment \n(indicated by the negative signs for \u2018surgery for \nthose that preferred medicine\u2019 and \u2018lifelong \nmedication for those that preferred surgery\u2019). \nSimilarly, individuals who received the treatment \nthat they preferred would experience less loss of \nutility (indicated by the positive signs for \u2018lifelong \nmedication for those that preferred medicine\u2019 and \n\u2018surgery for those that preferred surgery\u2019).\nSensitivity analyses\nAnalysis based on the whole sample \nbut excluding inconsistent responses\nThe econometric analysis was repeated for the \nwhole sample, this time omitting those individuals Discrete choice experiment to measure preferences for treatment options\n84\nTABLE 46  The regression model for the whole sample omitting the inconsistent responses\nDimension Coefficient Standard error p-value 95% CI\nTroublesome symptoms\n  Two or three times a week \u20130.415 0.062 0.000 \u20130.537 to \u20130.415\n  Most days\/every day \u20131.166 0.067 0.000 \u20131.297 to \u20131.166\nSerious complications \u20135.649 0.673 0.000 \u20136.967 to \u20135.648\nSurgery \u20134.754 0.858 0.000 \u20136.435 to \u20133.072\nLifelong medication \u20135.060 0.696 0.000 \u20136.425 to \u20133.696\nCI, confidence interval.\nConditional (fixed-effects) logistic regression: number of obs = 6274, LR \u03c72(5) = 497.95, prob > \u03c72 = 0.0000.\nLog likelihood = \u20131925.4265, pseudo r2 = 0.1145.\nTABLE 47  The regression model for the whole sample but including quadratic functions for continuous variables\nDimension Coefficient Standard error p-value 95% CI\nTroublesome symptoms\n  Two or three times a week \u20130.398 0.061 0.000 \u20130.518 to \u20130.278\n  Most days\/every day \u20131.127 0.065 0.000 \u20131.256 to \u20130.999\nSerious complications \u201327.853 4.142 0.000 \u201335.971 to \u201319.736\n  Quadratic function 1948.761 353.906 0.000 1255.118\u20132642.404\nSurgery \u201312.868 3.921 0.001 \u201320.554 to \u20135.182\n  Quadratic function 9.109 4.390 0.038 0.505\u201317.713\nLifelong medication \u20134.828 2.858 0.091 \u201310.430 to 0.774\n  Quadratic function \u20130.046 0.3133 0.988 \u20136.187 to 6.095\nCI, confidence interval.\nConditional (fixed-effects) logistic regression: number of obs = 6434, LR \u03c72(8) = 525.85, prob > \u03c72 = 0.0000.\nLog likelihood = \u20131966.929, pseudo r2 = 0.1179.\nwho failed the consistency tests (Table 46). As \nreported above, this had the effect of reducing \nthe sample size by ten respondents and 160 \nobservations. The results of this analysis are \nreported in Table 46, although the values for all \nattributes are higher except for the chance of \nundergoing surgery.\nAnalysis based on the whole sample \nbut including quadratic functions\nQuadratic functions were used in the model to \nestablish the linear relationships in the continuous \nvariables. All coefficients, except the chance of \nhaving lifelong medication and its associated \nquadratic function, were significant at the 5% \nlevel (Table 47). The quadratic functions for \nserious complications and chance of surgery are \nboth positive and this indicates that, as these \nrisks increase, the disutility still increases, but at a \ndecreasing rate. However, these results should only \nbe used to indicate that there may not be a linear \nrelationship for serious complications and surgery. \nThis is because the quadratic function is only a \nsimple method and can provide estimates of utility \nthat are counterintuitive for some levels of risk, for \nexample utility increases as risk increases. \nEstimation of utility scores \nfor each treatment group\nTable 48 reports the trial findings for the \ndimensions included in the DCE.

Also \nincluded in Table 49 are the utility scores for the \nworst case scenario (by default the utility score for \nthe best case scenario is 0). Using the approach \noutlined in the methods section, the relative weight \nof each of the four trial groups relative to the \nbest case scenario was estimated from these data \n(Table 50).\nAs Table 49 illustrates, the largest component of \ntotal utility comes from serious complications. The \ndata presented in this table also serve to illustrate Discrete choice experiment to measure preferences for treatment options\n86\nthe importance of patients\u2019 preferences for utility. \nFor example, the utility gained by a person who \nprefers surgery receiving the treatment they prefer \n(46.1) is just less than the disutility associated with \nsurgery (46.8). \nAs indicated above, the comparisons between \nthe four treatment groups are best informed by \nconsidering their relative weights. As there are \nseveral different relative weights that could be \ncalculated, it was decided to compare the mean \ntotal utility for each arm with the total utility \nthat is implied for the best possible combination \nof attributes and levels (the last column of Table \n50). As the data in this table illustrate, relative to \nthe best case, the preference surgical group has \nthe highest weight and the randomised surgical \ngroup has the lowest weight. In this situation the \npreference arms are associated with higher mean \nutilities than the randomised arms. \nDiscussion\nThe aim of this chapter was to use a DCE to \nexplore the strength of preference for the \ntreatment and outcomes of GORD. This approach \nhas been used to measure preferences of GORD \npatients previously128,129 but this earlier work \nsought to establish willingness to pay for complete \nsymptom relief of GORD and for diagnostic \nuncertainty. The DCE reported in this chapter \nwas different in that it attempted to explore \npreferences for the outcomes of treatment (e.g. \ntroublesome symptoms and serious complications) \nand preferences for the process by which these \noutcomes were obtained. \nThe results of the DCE indicate that the \nmost important single dimension is serious \ncomplications, followed by a 10% change in the \nchance of having surgery or receiving lifelong \nmedication. Suffering troublesome symptoms \nmost days was less important, although the unit of \nanalysis was a 1% chance of this event occurring. \nThere was no evidence that respondents placed any \nimportance on suffering troublesome symptoms \nonce a week in comparison with no symptoms. \nThe group that was associated with the highest \nutility relative to a best case situation was the \npreference surgical group, and the group that \nwas associated with the lowest utility was the \nrandomised surgical group. If the effect of serious \ncomplications is removed from the consideration \nof utility, then the preference groups are associated \nwith higher levels of utility relative to the best case \nthan the randomised groups. Furthermore, the \nsurgical group is associated with higher utility than \nthe medical group.\nThe exclusion of serious complications from \nthe consideration of utility might be considered \ncontentious. However, an analysis was conducted to \nexplore whether the preferences for the continuous \nvariables (risk of serious complications, risk of \nsurgery and risk of receiving lifelong medication) \nin the econometric analysis were linear. The results \nof this analysis indicated that, although utility fell \nas risk increased, it fell at a decreasing rate for \nboth the risk of serious complications and surgery \n(there was no evidence of this effect for lifelong \nmedication). The implication of this is that it is \npossible that there is little or no difference in \nthe loss of utility caused by serious complications \nTABLE 50  Relative utility of each trial arm relative to the utility of the best case scenario\nSituation\nLoss of utility from the \nbest possible combination \nof attributes and levelsa\nGain in utility from \nthe worst possible \ncombination of attributes \nand levels \nRelative weight compared \nwith the best case\nBest case 0 810 1.000\nWorst case \u2013810 0 0.000\nRandomised surgical \u2013119 691 0.853\nRandomised medical \u201379 732 0.903\nPreference surgical \u201344 766 0.946\nPreference medical \u201369 742 0.915\na Estimated from Table 49.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

Research is required to further \ninvestigate how this non-linearity in preferences \nmight be most appropriately modelled, as the \nquadratic function would result in implausible \nutility estimates for higher risks of serious \ncomplications than were considered in the DCE \nquestionnaire.\nThe results of the analysis presented in this chapter \nalso provide some insight into the importance of \npeople\u2019s preferences for treatment with respect to \nutility. For example, people who have a preference \nfor medicine but who actually undergo surgery \nexperience almost twice the loss of utility (1.059 \nor \u20130.557 + \u20130.502) as those people in the \nrandomised arm who receive surgery (\u20130.557) for a \n1% increase in the risk of surgery. Similarly, people \nwho preferred surgery and received surgery lost \nless utility (\u20130.008 or \u20130.557 + 0.549). This result \nindicates the importance of patient choice when \ndecisions are made about which type of treatment \nto provide.\nSome of the limitations of the analysis reported in \nthis chapter have already been described but one \nfurther limitation relates to how the information \nderived by the DCE could have been used in \nthe economic model reported earlier. It was \nnot possible, nor was it planned, for these two \n\u2018economic\u2019 elements to be integrated. Indeed, \nmethods to integrate DCEs into a trial remain \nrelatively undeveloped. However, future work \nshould consider how a DCE and an economic \nmodel conducted as part of a trial analysis can be \ndeveloped in an integrated fashion. It is likely that \nthis will involve the attributes and levels of the \nDCE being reflected in the model structure, with \nthe values of attribute levels being produced by the \nmodel and fed into the estimation of utilities as \npart of the DCE analysis. Any attempt to integrate \nthese approaches would be facilitated by the use of \na common continuous measure, such as willingness \nto pay, so that all dimensions could be valued in \nterms of this numeraire.\nThe methods used to analyse and present the \nresults of the DCE have limitations. One of \nthe main limitations is the limited handling of \nuncertainty in the analysis. In economic studies it is \nexpected that an extensive sensitivity analysis would \nbe conducted to assess how robust the conclusions \nare. Increasingly, as exemplified by the economic \nevaluation presented in Chapter 7, it is becoming \nexpected that a probabilistic sensitivity analysis will \nbe used to develop credible intervals around mean \nestimates. Although sensitivity analysis has been \nperformed as part of the work reported in this \nchapter, probabilistic sensitivity analysis has not \nbeen conducted. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis \nwould also help overcome a further limitation of \nthe DCE. When analysing the DCE, we followed \nthe common econometric convention of combining \nlevels of dimensions when there was no evidence of \na statistically significant difference and of dropping \nparameters from an analysis when the coefficients \nwere not statistically significant. There is some \ndebate about how appropriate this approach is as \nit reduces the information available to decision-\nmakers. However, with probabilistic sensitivity \nanalysis a full model, including both statistically \nsignificant and insignificant coefficients, can be \nused to develop both mean utility scores and \ncredible intervals. Therefore, further work might \nfocus on conducting a probabilistic sensitivity \nanalysis. \nDCEs use hypothetical questions and, as such, \nthey have been criticised. This is because it is \nunclear whether people would pick these scenarios \nif they were faced with these choices in real life. \nNevertheless, the respondents to the DCE all had \nexperience of GORD and its treatment (either \nmedical, surgical or both); hence, it was hoped \nthat the respondents would be able to consider \nthe choices and trade-offs involved in each choice \nquestion. \nA final concern relates to the number of choice \nquestions to present to potential respondents. \nThe greater the number of dimensions and \nlevels that are considered relevant the greater \nthe number of possible scenarios that individuals \ncould potentially be presented with. Experimental \ndesign techniques were used to reduce the number \nof scenarios that were presented to individuals \nwhile still allowing for utilities to be inferred for \nall possible scenarios. However, even after the use \nof these techniques it was felt that the number of \nquestions to be presented (n = 16) was too great. \nAs a consequence, the questions were randomly \nsplit into two questionnaires, each containing eight \nquestions. It was hoped that this would increase the \ncompletion rate of the questionnaire, although it \ndid have the effect of reducing our ability to detect \nimportant differences in preferences. Overall, the \ncompletion rate achieved was quite high for a DCE \nquestionnaire (which are thought to be cognitively \ndemanding on respondents) and this may be \nattributed to the relatively short length of the \nquestionnaire. Discrete choice experiment to measure preferences for treatment options\n88\nConclusions\nThe results of the DCE presented in this chapter \ncomplement the evidence reported in earlier \nchapters. The results also aid the interpretation \nof the clinical evidence by indicating the \nimportance placed on type of treatment and \nthe ability of a treatment to resolve symptoms. \nThe most important single dimension is serious \ncomplications, followed by changes in surgery, \nlifelong medication and troublesome symptoms \nmost days. There was no statistically significant \nevidence that respondents placed any importance \non suffering troublesome symptoms once a week \nin comparison with no symptoms. Relative to \na best case situation the trial arm associated \nwith the highest mean utility was the preference \nsurgical group and that associated with the lowest \nmean utility was the randomised surgical group. \nThe utility associated with surgery is dependent \nupon the risk of serious complications, which \nwas assumed to be greater than that for lifelong \nmedical treatment. If the effect of serious \ncomplications is removed from the consideration \nof utility, the preference arms are associated with \nhigher levels of utility than the randomised groups. \nFurthermore, the surgical arms are associated with \nhigher utility than the medical arms. Thus, the \nresults of the analysis indicate the importance of \nquantifying the risk of serious complications and \nof considering patient choice when decisions are \nmade about which types of treatment to provide \nand the type of treatment to recommend. \nAdditional further research is also indicated. Part \nof this research should focus on how approaches \nsuch as DCEs can be made more useful to trials-\nbased research. A more specific research need is \nto consider how best to describe the imprecision \nsurrounding the mean estimates of utilities that are \ngenerated.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

In comparison with the results \nobtained at 3 months there were sustained better \nscores but with some evidence of attenuation of \nthe differences. For example, the number taking \nreflux-related drugs after surgery went up from \naround 9% to 14%. Narrowing of differences was \nmost marked for the EQ-5D health status measure. \nIt is possible that some of the \u2018improvement\u2019 \nis due to a placebo effect of surgery and one \nexplanation of any attenuation of difference is that \nthe placebo effect has diminished over time. This \ncould be clarified by further follow-up to find out if \ndifferences are sustained or whether there is more \nnarrowing of the differences.\nIn addition to the randomised groups the trial \nalso had two preference groups, which aid \ninterpretation of the randomised trial results. As \na group, the preference surgical participants had \nthe lowest baseline R e f l u x  scores (worst symptoms) \nand the preference medical group the highest (with \nthe randomised groups between them (see Figure \n14). After surgery the preference surgical group \nhad scores that rose to the level of the preference \nmedical group and by 12 months they were the \nbetter of the two groups. The preference groups \ngive an indication of likely behaviour if surgery \nwere to become more freely available. In addition \nto having the least well-controlled symptoms at \nbaseline, the preference surgical group had been \non medication longer and were less concerned \nabout possible adverse effects of surgery (described \nin Chapter 5).\nThe preference groups also add extra information \nabout clinical events, in particular rare serious \nadverse events. Taken at face value, laparoscopic \nfundoplication appears to be a relatively safe \nprocedure; however, even the experience of all of \nthe 329 participants who had surgery is too little to \nprovide sufficiently precise estimates of uncommon \nevents. So, questions still remain about the extent \nof possible adverse effects of surgery and their \nfrequency.\nT\nhe advent of less invasive fundoplication \nperformed laparoscopically opened up new \npossibilities for the management of people with \nchronic symptoms of GORD. Good results obtained \namongst people whose symptoms were not \nsatisfactorily controlled by medical management \nraised questions about the place of relatively early \nsurgery in people with GORD whose symptom \ncontrol from long-term medical management was \nreasonably acceptable. Would surgery be more \neffective than continuing medical management? \nWould surgery be sufficiently safe? And would \nwidening the use of laparoscopic fundoplication \nto such patients be cost-effective? These are the \nprincipal questions addressed in this study.\nThe study had two main components: a pragmatic \nrandomised controlled trial to assess clinical \neffectiveness and an economic evaluation \nto explore cost-effectiveness and the wider \nimplications for efficient health-care provision.\nThe trial provided clear evidence of effectiveness \nin respect of reflux-related quality of life. Even \nthough the number of participants in the trial \nwas not as large as originally intended, the sizes \nof differences observed in the condition-specific \nreflux quality of life measure were so large that \nthey were highly statistically significant. As with \nother disease-specific measures, the magnitude of \nthese differences is hard to conceptualise. However, \nbroadly similar differences were also observed in \nmost components of the more accessible generic \nhealth status measures, SF-36 and EQ-5D.\nAs described in Chapter 6, clear differences \nwere observed even though as many as one-\nthird of those allocated surgery did not have \nfundoplication. Extra analyses explored how \nmuch of a blunting effect this might have had on \nthe results and, arguably, these adjusted analyses \nprovide better estimates of the true effects of \nsurgery in this type of population as it might be \nused in normal clinical practice.Conclusions\n90\nThe within-trial (i.e. up to 12 months of follow-up) \ncost-effectiveness analysis related the extra mean \ncosts associated with the surgical policy with the \nincrease in mean QALYs that followed surgery to \ngenerate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. \nThis was around \u00a319,000 when the intention to \ntreat approach to analysis was used. Taking into \naccount uncertainties around the various estimates, \nit was calculated that the chances that the surgical \npolicy would be cost-effective at a threshold of \n\u00a320,000 per QALY was 46%. When a per protocol \napproach was used, the incremental cost per QALY \nincreased to around \u00a323,000, with a probability \nthat this would be cost-effective at a threshold \nof \u00a320,000 of only 19%. These results indicate \nconsiderable uncertainty at thresholds that are \ncurrently commonly applied to costs per QALY.\nThe within-trial analyses have significant \nlimitations, however, as discussed in Chapters 7 \nand 8. The most important is that they ignore \nevents, costs and benefits that accrue after 1 year. \nIt is likely that surgery will continue to bestow \nbenefits after 1 year, although there could also be \nrelapse of symptoms, and medical management \nmay require lifelong medication with significant \ncosts. For this reason, the R e f l u x  trial data were \nsynthesised with other data to develop an extended \ncost-effectiveness model. This explored a number \nof possible scenarios. Assuming that the benefits \nof surgery persist throughout a lifetime, that \nwithout surgery mediation use would continue for \na lifetime, that there would be a 4.8% annual rate \nof additional uptake of medication in the surgery \ngroup, and that there would be an annual 0.8% \nreoperation rate led to an estimated incremental \ncost per QALY of around only \u00a32000, with a 74% \nprobability of surgery  being considered cost-\neffective at a threshold of \u00a320,000 per QALY. \nApplying other plausible assumptions, however, \ngave a range of incremental costs per QALY of \nbetween \u00a31000 and \u00a344,000, again indicative of \nwide uncertainty. The factors most contributing \nto the uncertainty were the projected HRQoL \nparameters and the long-term rate of uptake of \nmedication following surgery.\nThe DCE was performed to provide an alternative \nway of assessing the weights that people with \nGORD place on their outcome and treatment. The \nresults were broadly in line with the other economic \nevaluation in this project, based on the EQ-5D. \nThe DCE did show, however, that respondents put \nconsiderable weight on avoiding rare but serious \nrisks. The economic analysis found that these risks \nhave little impact on QALYs on average and that \nthe uncertainty in the clinical results about their \nincidence does not affect the treatment decision at \nthe population level, all other things being equal. \nNevertheless, the DCE highlights that these risks \nmay be important when patients choose whether to \naccept surgery if it is offered.\nCurrently available evidence from the R e f l u x  \ntrial indicates that surgery could be cost-effective \nat the thresholds (\u00a320,000\u2013\u00a330,000) currently \napplied by the National Institute for Health and \nClinical Excellence (NICE) but with considerable \nuncertainty. The extended model suggests that \nthe true cost-effectiveness, when lifetime costs \nand benefits are taken into account, is likely to be \nmore favourable. But this, too, is prone to major \nuncertainty.\nQuestions also remain about the generalisability \nof the study\u2019s results. The economic model was \nbased on a 45-year-old man, whereas many people \nreceiving PPIs for GORD are older than this and \ncan have significant co-morbidities. \nThe most urgent need for further research, \ntherefore, is to acquire improved estimates of \nlonger-term benefits and costs. This could be \naccomplished relatively easily by continuing \nannual follow-up in the R e f l u x  trial, and indeed \narrangements for this have been put in place. \nFunds have recently been awarded by the HTA \nProgramme to support follow-up to 5 years after \nsurgery. Our analyses of cost-effectiveness will then \nbe updated to take these results and other changes \n(such as in the costs of PPIs) into account. In the \nmeantime it may be worth exploring whether there \nare other longer-standing non-randomised cohorts \nthat could be useful in this respect. Perceptions of \nthe risks of rare adverse events may play a major \nrole in decision-making about surgery. Such cohorts \ncould also be useful for getting more precise \nestimates of uncommon events associated with both \nsurgical and medical management.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

The information you provide will be completely \nconfidential. \n \n \n \n \nHOW TO FILL IN THE QUESTIONNAIRE \n \nIn  this  questionnaire,  you  are  presented  with  10  questions  relating  to  different  GORD \ntreatment choices, each describing two or three treatment options: Option A or Option B and \nsometimes Option C.   \n \nWhen answering these questions, we would like you to imagine that your gastroenterologist \nis offering you the choice of treatment options (A or B or C) and that (s)he would like you to \npick the option you prefer.   You would do this by putting a tick in the appropriate box.   \n \nAlthough,  you  may  not  like  either  treatment  option,  please  choose  the  one  that  is  most \npreferable to you.   \n \nPlease tick just ONE box for every question.
