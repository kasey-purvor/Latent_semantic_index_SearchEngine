The\nplans aim to maintain essential services, reduce\ndisease transmission and the socioeconomic\nconsequences of a pandemic, and minimize\nthe number of infectious cases, hospitaliza-\ntions, and deaths (EISS 2007; Mounier-Jack\net al. 2007). \nThe WHO has strongly recommended\nthe use of the antiviral Tamiflu, produced and\ndistributed by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.\n(Basel, Switzerland), as the primary choice for\ncombating an influenza pandemic (WHO\n2006a). Tamiflu was recommended because\na) there is low natural viral resistance (Aoki\net al. 2007; Roberts 2001); b) it is easy to\nadminister orally via capsule; c) it is systemi-\ncally active; and d) it is effective against char-\nacterized influenza A and B viruses (Ward\net al. 2005; WHO 2006b). International\nstockpiles of influenza A antivirals have been\ngrowing rapidly since 2005 (Figure 1), and\nmost countries are stockpiling sufficient quan-\ntities of antiviral to treat 25% of their popula-\ntion (Department of Health and Human\nServices 2006; Ferguson et al. 2006; Roche\n2007). Stockpiles are anticipated to continue\nto increase toward a 50% coverage goal in\nsome countries. In addition, stockpiles are\nlikely to diversify, incorporating additional\nneuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) such as\nzanamivir (Relenza; GlaxoSmithKline,\nLondon, UK) (Ferraris et al. 2005) and\nperamivir (Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Cary,\nNC, USA) (Smee and Sidwell 2002), as well\nas traditional antivirals such as amantadine\nand rimantadine (WHO 2007). \nThe United Kingdom has stockpiled 14.6\nmillion courses of Tamiflu, equating to nearly\n11 metric tons of oseltamivir ethylester-phos-\nphate (OE-P), all of which is expected to be\nused for treatment during the 9- to 12-week\nperiod of a pandemic. OE-P use has been\nidentified as a potentially unacceptable risk,\nand various potential effects and exposures\nare associated with oseltamivir carboxylate\n(OC) (Singer et al. 2007).

Hoffmann-La Roche 2007) \n\u2022 Negligible biodegradation of OC in river\nwater (Accinelli et al. 2007) \n\u2022 Insufficient dilution of OC in many of the\nexamined receiving river waters to obviate\necotoxicologic risks (Singer et al. 2007).\nPreliminary hazard characterization. It\nhas been suggested that the release of OC into\nrivers generates OC resistance in avian\ninfluenza in wildfowl (Singer et al. 2007). OC\ncould enter the gut of wildfowl from ingested\nriver water and interact with the avian\ninfluenza neuraminidase. The concentration\nof OC in the gut might be higher than in\nriver water owing to recycling of the urine in\nwaterfowl, thereby further increasing the\nselection pressure for OC resistance. \nThe workshop, Tamiflu and the Environ-\nment: Implications of Use under Pandemic\nConditions, was designed to further charac-\nterize the hazards and risks associated with\nthe projected scale of Tamiflu release to the\nenvironment during a pandemic, as well as to\nidentify priorities for further research. It was\nrecognized by the workshop\u2019s organizers that\na holistic assessment of risks could be made\nbest by bringing together diverse experts and\norganizations with relevant experience.\nAccordingly, experts in environmental\nchemistry, ecotoxicology, virology, micro-\nbiology, enzymology, hydrology, public\nhealth protection, and wastewater engineering\nwere invited to participate. The pharmaceuti-\ncal industry, the water industry, and central\ngovernment were represented, together with a\nwide variety of organizations advising and\nsupporting these sectors. \nOverview\nTo ensure that all participants had the knowl-\nedge base required, plenary talks provided an\noverview of the current understanding of the\nprocesses and hazards associated with OC\nrelease to the environment.\nIn selected U.S. and U.K. catchments dur-\ning an influenza pandemic, the predicted envi-\nronmental concentration (PEC) of OC\ndepends on population size and liters of river\nwater available for dilution of sewage effluent\nper capita. Concentrations of OC in catch-\nments with particularly low flow and high\npopulations are predicted to be > 20 \u00b5g\/L,\nwhich is significantly higher than that observed\nfor most other pharmaceutical contaminants.\nOC may possibly affect the function and sta-\nbility of sewage treatment plants (STPs) as a\nresult of the inhibition of floc or biofilm for-\nmation, as these microbial growth forms are\nintegral to process stability and functionality.\nBecause a mixture of pharmaceuticals\u2014\nparticularly antibiotics\u2014is likely to pass\nthrough STPs during a pandemic, the risk of\ninhibition of floc or biofilm formation could\nbe even greater. Also, the generation of OC\nresistance in avian influenza\u2013infected wildfowl\nafter exposure to OC-contaminated river water\nwould be difficult to manage because of the\nmigratory nature of the hosts. \nFurther pandemics could be avoided with a\nconcerted research effort including robust pre-\nparedness plans, especially the use of antivirals.\nThe proportion of the population receiving\nTamiflu could be higher than the 25% consid-\nered by Singer et al. (2007). Although it is\ninevitable that drug-resistant forms of the\ninfluenza virus will occur, strains of influenza\nthat are resistant to pharmaceuticals have been\nfound to have compromised biological fitness\n(Aoki et al. 2007).\nThe principles of environmental assess-\nment processes have been reported by the\nEMEA (2006). Regarding the current regula-\ntory framework for predicted no-effect con-\ncentration (PNEC) and PEC assessments for\nhuman pharmaceuticals in various countries,\nEurope emphasizes chronic effects assessment\nin algae, crustaceans, and fish, whereas the\nUnited States focuses on the assessment of\nacute effects. The European Centre for\nEcotoxicology & Toxicology of Chemicals\n(ECETOC 2007) argues for intelligent strate-\ngies for chronic ecotoxicity testing that reflects\nthe mode-of-action protein target(s) of a given\nchemical (e.g., agrochemical, biocide, pharma-\nceutical). For example, chronic testing of\nestrogenic drugs should include aquatic ani-\nmal species that are known to have estrogen\nreceptors. Wider use of the mode-of-action\nintelligent testing strategy approach as an\nalternative to routine lethality testing would\nprovide important animal welfare and eco-\nnomic benefits while simultaneously providing\na sound scientific rationale for calculating\nPNECs for OE-P, OC, and other important\nhuman pharmaceuticals.\nUnpublished results from ongoing\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment (OECD) environmental degra-\ndation and toxicity tests on environmentally\nand physiologically relevant mixtures of OE-P\nand OC were presented. The available data\nindicate that most of the dose received by the\nhuman population will pass through sewage\ntreatment works and therefore enter surface\nwaters, with negligible removal from the water\ncolumn to sediments. Chronic ecotoxicity\ntesting has been conducted in light of the\n2006 EMEA guidelines on environmental risk\nassessment for human pharmaceuticals requir-\ning PNECs based on chronic data (EMEA\n2006) and the projected \u2265 8 weeks of OC\nrelease into receiving rivers during a pandemic\n(Singer et al. 2007). These chronic ecotoxicity\ntests were performed with green algae\n(Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) in a growth\ninhibition test, with Daphnia magna in a\nreproductive toxicity study, and with zebrafish\nin an early-life-stage test, all following OECD\nguidelines 201 (OECD 1984), 211 (OECD\n1998), and 210 (OECD 1992), respectively,\nSinger et al.\n1564 VOLUME 116 | NUMBER 11 | November 2008 \u2022 Environmental Health Perspectives\nFigure 1.

The preliminary no\nobserved effects concentrations (NOECs)\nresulted in a PNEC of 100 \u00b5g\/L, applying an\nassessment factor of 10. This PNEC is higher\nthan published PECs (Singer et al. 2007) or\nthose newly calculated using worst-case pan-\ndemic use assumptions and various algorithms.\nHence, based on recognized environmental risk\nassessment procedures as detailed in the\nEuropean Union Technical Guidance Document\non Risk Assessment (European Commission\n2003), risk from OE-P and OC in the scenarios\npresented appear to be negligible, including the\nlow-dilution scenario in the River Lee in the\nUnited Kingdom (Singer et al. 2007). \nThe U.K. Environment Agency does not\nhave any role in the licensing of human\npharmaceuticals or the environmental safety\nassessments required by the regulatory process.\nIn the United Kingdom the responsibility for\nissuing licenses lies with the Medicines and\nHealthcare products Regulatory Agency\n(MHRA). Furthermore, the Environment\nAgency has no advisory role in this process. By\ncontrast, the Environment Agency acts as an\nadvisor to the relevant competent authorities\nfor pesticides, biocides, and veterinary pharma-\nceuticals for issues relating to environmental\nsafety. The program of work on human\npharmaceuticals lies within the Environment\nAgency\u2019s responsibility for assessing and report-\ning on the state of the environment, as well as\nidentifying possible environmental concerns.\nThis work includes a screening process used to\nrank pharmaceuticals based on their relative\nrisk to the aquatic environment (Environment\nAgency 2003, 2008) and a short, targeted\nmonitoring program conducted for a number\nof the higher-priority pharmaceuticals\n(Environment Agency 2003). OE-P was not\nincluded in the screening process because of its\nlow usage in the United Kingdom for routine\ntreatment. The Environment Agency therefore\nconducted a separate assessment for use under\npandemic conditions, drawing on public\ninformation sources. Exposure was estimated\nfor treatment only and for treatment plus pro-\nphylaxis, using assumptions from Singer et al.\n(2007) and modified assumptions from the\nDepartment of Health based on treatment of\n50% of the population with Tamiflu and pro-\nphylaxis (Scientific Pandemic Influenza\nAdvisory Committe 2008). Based on available\ndata, risk to the aquatic environment from\nOE-P and OC appeared low. However, this\nrequires further investigation for catchments\nwith high population and low dilution of\nsewage effluents in surface waters. The\nEnvironment Agency will review new data\ngenerated on fate and effects of OC (e.g., by\nF. Hoffmann-La Roche) before reaching any\nfurther conclusions (T. Boucard, personal\ncommunication).\nRiver water pollution with pharmaceuticals\nis relevant in the United Kingdom, particularly\nin England, because it is a densely populated,\nsmall island with relatively short low-flow\nrivers (Keller et al. 2006). More precise model-\ning is needed to determine specific locations\nwhere local risks to water pollution are greatest.\nHydrologic and demographic factors in the\nUnited Kingdom indicate that the Midlands,\nThames, and Anglian regions of England are\nlikely at highest risk.\nAim and Objectives\nThe aim of the workshop was to assess the\nimplications of Tamiflu release to the environ-\nment following mass administration under pan-\ndemic conditions, and to identify any further\nactions required to minimize risks to human\nand environmental health.\nFour multidisciplinary working groups\naddressed the following questions:\n1. Does current knowledge about Tamiflu\nrelease to the environment provide suffi-\ncient assurance of safety for human health\nand the environment?\n2. What are the research needs to ensure that\nthe risks associated with Tamiflu release to\nthe environment can be better understood,\nminimized, or mitigated?\n3. Of any research requirements identified,\nwhat are the priority research tasks?\n4. What are the long-term issues triggered by,\nor associated with, the issue of Tamiflu\nrelease to the environment?\nResults\nWorkgroup members were asked to quantify\ntheir assurance of safety with the present\nknowledge base on Tamiflu release to the\nenvironment on a scale of 1\u20135 (where 1 = low\nassurance of safety and 5 = high assurance of\nsafety). The mean \u00b1 SD rating for the four\nworking group sessions was 3.3 \u00b1 0.3.\nThe highest priority knowledge gaps iden-\ntified by participants fell into four main areas:\na) ecotoxicologic effects; b) antiviral resis-\ntance; c) STP failure, particularly as a result of\nnontarget neuraminidase inhibition (e.g.,\nmicroorganisms); and d) exposure models to\ndefine realistic worst-case scenarios for envi-\nronmental exposure.\nEcotoxicity. Most participants concluded\nthat the ecotoxicity of OE-P and OC was not\nlikely to be an area of primary concern based\non preliminary data (Straub JO, personal com-\nmunication). Many participants expressed a\ndesire to see a broader range of ecotoxicologic\nwork conducted and published in peer-\nreviewed journals. However, the level of con-\ncern regarding the ecotoxicity was generally\nquite low. Considerably greater concern was\nexpressed regarding the potential inhibition of\nnontarget neuraminidases in organisms other\nthan influenza viruses (e.g., microorganisms).\nAntiviral resistance. Workshop partici-\npants were uncertain about the potential for\ngeneration of OC resistance in avian influenza\nviruses as a result of the exposure of wildfowl\nto OC in surface waters. Concerns were some-\nwhat alleviated by the knowledge that OC is\nnot readily absorbed from the gut and there-\nfore should not be present in significant\namounts in the urine to recycle, as proposed by\nSinger et al. (2007). The consensus opinion\nwas that it is difficult to predict the exposure of\nOC in the wild fowl gut and its implications\nfor hastening the generation of OC-resistance\nin avian influenza. However, attending virolo-\ngists agreed that reassortment, or mutation,\nwould be required to generate a virus with\nhuman specificity, and such viruses would have\nto find a path to circulate back to humans. The\nactual risk to the human population is unlikely\nto be significant. Nevertheless, the possibility\nof OC resistance arising in influenza viruses in\nwaterfowl, although unlikely, cannot be cate-\ngorically ruled out. Thus, it is important to\nconsider the consequences if resistant viruses\nshould evolve (be selected).\nThe highest concentrations of OC in river\nwater will be reached only during relatively\nshort spells of very high drug usage during an\ninfluenza pandemic. This can occur only after\nthousands of infected patients have been\ntreated with the drug. Resistant viruses will\ninevitably evolve in some of these patients in\nadvance of any possible selection in waterfowl.\nThus, should the waterfowl be infected with\nthe pandemic strain, the resistant virus strains\nand genetic mutations encoding OC resistance\nselected will be common to both species but\nselected in humans first. A resistant pandemic\nvirus in waterfowl, alongside the same viruses\nalready in humans, will have little or no effect\non the human situation. Similar to the situa-\ntion in humans, resistant viruses in waterfowl\nare likely to be cleared or revert to wild-type\nonce river OC levels fall and the selection pres-\nsure is removed. Available data regarding the\nnature of OC resistance indicate that muta-\ntions responsible for conferring resistance\nseverely compromise viral growth and infectiv-\nity (Aoki et al. 2007; Chutinimitkul et al.\n2007; Hayden 2006; Hurt et al. 2007; Lipsitch\net al. 2007; Yen et al. 2005). If resistance were\nselected or acquired by reassortment in other\navian virus strains, again the resistant viruses\nwould likely revert to wild-type once selection\npressure was removed. If for some reason this\ndid not happen and the resistant virus persisted\nas one of the avian virus strains circulating in\nwaterfowl, then its chance of becoming a\nhuman pathogen (by chance mutation or\nrecombination) would be no greater than that\nfor any of the other 16 avian influenza A virus\nserotypes in circulation. Such events are rare;\nhighly pathogenic H5N1 viruses have been cir-\nculating and infecting the occasional human\nAssessment of Tamiflu release to the environment \nEnvironmental Health Perspectives \u2022 VOLUME 116 | NUMBER 11 | November 2008 1565\nwho has direct contact with birds since 1997,\nand the virus has still not achieved the capabil-\nity of transmitting between humans. Thus, the\nidea of a \u201csecond wave\u201d pandemic arising by\nthis mechanism is considered highly unlikely.\nThere is concern that nonpandemic strains\nmight not be a good predictor of how a pan-\ndemic strain of influenza could develop,\nbecause the possibility of developing compen-\nsatory mutations could allow an OC-resistant\npandemic strain to grow and infect in an\nuncompromised manner. There appears to be\na gap between the perceptions of nonvirologists\nworking in this field and the views expressed\nby virologists that emergence of resistance is\nunlikely to pose a threat.\nSTP failure. In the event of an influenza\npandemic, STPs will receive approximately\n10-fold higher concentrations of OC (and\nother antiviral or antimicrobial compounds)\nthan is projected to occur in rivers (Singer et al.\n2007), because the STP effluent is diluted by\nriver flow. This higher concentrations will pose\na widespread problem to STPs if these com-\npounds inhibit the process organisms during a\npandemic. One of the concerns is that OC\nmight exhibit activity on neuraminidases pro-\nduced by bacteria within STPs. Because there\nare potential analogous receptors that might\nrespond to the release of Tamiflu, it would be\nprudent to assess the nontarget \u201cactivity\u201d of the\ndrug. Tamiflu is an NAI that was rationally\ndesigned to inhibit the influenza A and B neu-\nraminidase; however, there is a basis for consid-\nering that a neuraminidase present in a\nbacterium could also be inhibited by Tamiflu.\nSoong et al. (2006) demonstrated the efficacy\nof OC and a similar antiviral, peramivir, to\ninhibit biofilm formation in the microorgan-\nism Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These authors\nwere interested in the potential to use the NAI\nfor alleviating symptoms of cystic fibrosis,\nhence they did not investigate environmentally\nrelevant concentrations of OC. Nevertheless,\nthey found that 1 \u00b5g\/L OC demonstrated a\n0.6-fold inhibition of biofilm formation, which\nmight be applicable to concentrations in STPs\nduring an influenza pandemic (Soong et al.\n2006). This demonstration of the importance\nof bacterial neuraminidases in biofilm forma-\ntion indicates the possible vulnerability of STP\nbiofilms to OC exposure during a pandemic.\nThere are additional concerns regarding STP\nfailure because of the potential scale of anti-\nbiotic use to treat secondary infections stem-\nming from influenza-infected patients,\nalthough the use of antivirals might decrease\nthe need for antibiotic use (Kaiser et al. 2003;\nNicholson et al. 2000; Treanor et al. 2000;\nWhitley et al. 2000). \nChanges in activated sludge floc integrity\nor the biofilms in trickling filter works could\nlead to a loss of effective sewage treatment.\nThis would have catastrophic environmental\nconsequences, as untreated sewage entering\nrivers would kill a large number of the aquatic\norganisms and be an additional threat to\nhuman health. Another concern is that\nrestarting sewage works with fresh cultures is\na difficult process. \nExposure models. One example of routine\nuse of OE-P for seasonal influenza is Japan,\nwhich maintains the highest use of NAIs of\nany country in the world. Greater than 90% of\nthe prescriptions for seasonal influenza in\nJapan are for OE-P (Moscona and McKimm-\nBreschkin 2007). Sewage works in Japan have\nbeen processing OC from 5\u201310% population\ntreatment per annum for > 4 years. There is\nconcern regarding this use pattern and whether\nsufficient OC is released into rivers within\nJapan to generate an OC-resistant strain even\nbefore the onset of a pandemic. However, the\nrisk posed by the generation of OC-resistance\nin the environment from OC-containing\nsewage effluent is likely to be low, for the\naforementioned reasons. Japan might provide\nan opportunity to test the validity of the model\nsystems used to predict river levels of OC dur-\ning high drug usage and to examine the long\nterm effect of high OC levels on sewage treat-\nment efficiency and biofilms in real life situa-\ntions. Swabbing of wildfowl in Japan for\nOC-resistant virus could be conducted to\ndetect resistance events, but as these are likely\nto be rare, the results of such a study would be\nequivocal without very high sample numbers.\nConclusions\nBy assembling a wide range of relevant exper-\ntise, Tamiflu and the Environment: Implica-\ntions of Use under Pandemic Conditions\nprovided a unique opportunity to make a pre-\nliminary holistic assessment of whether safety\nfor the environment and human health can be\nassured if Tamiflu is used under pandemic\nconditions. Although questions of safety assur-\nance depend on professional judgment, the\nconsensus of this workshop was that OE-P\nand OC release into the environment might\nstill pose risks associated with the generation\nof antiviral resistance or destabilization of\nmicrobial biofilms that are key to the perfor-\nmance and function of STPs. The risk of OC\nresistance in wildfowl seems to be less signifi-\ncant than the effects of mixtures of pharma-\nceuticals in sewage and the sewage treatment\nprocess. This is a critical issue given the\nunprecedented quantities of analgesics, anti-\ninflammatory drugs, antipyretics, antibiotics,\nand antivirals likely to be used in a pandemic.\nThe case of seasonal use of Tamiflu in Japan\nmight provide a valuable surrogate for assess-\ning the implications of release under pandemic\nconditions, as well as validating models.\nPotential inhibition of microbial neu-\nraminidases raised additional questions pertain-\ning to the pharmaceutical regulatory process:\nFirst, should additional tests be performed on\n\u201cnontarget\u201d organisms (e.g., bacteria) and sce-\nnarios (e.g., STPs) based on the mode of\naction? Second, should the environmental\nsafety of pharmaceuticals be specifically evalu-\nated for pandemic scenarios, where appropriate? \nThe assessment of pharmaceutical release\nto the environment, particularly that projected\nto occur under epidemic or pandemic condi-\ntions, requires the integration of a diverse\nrange of scientific expertise across a range of\npublic and private organizations. As part of\nthis, national environmental regulators should\nplay a more active role informing international\nand national authorities governing pharma-\nceutical use. Clearly, the implications for the\nwater industry of potentially large quantities of\nantimicrobial products entering STPs need to\nbe assessed more carefully.\nThe risk scenarios proposed here are not\nunique to Tamiflu or to an influenza pan-\ndemic, but to all future epidemics and pan-\ndemics. Hence, the output of the workshop\nprovides an initial effort toward developing\nfully integrated preparedness plans that con-\nsider all facets of human and environmental\nhealth.\nRecommendations\nRecommendations from Tamiflu and the\nEnvironment: Implications of Use under\nPandemic Conditions are as follows:\n\u2022 The vulnerability of STPs should be exam-\nined regarding exposure to the predicted\nconcentrations of OC and antibiotics during\na pandemic.\n\u2022 All newly generated environmental fate and\necotoxicologic data for OC and OE-P, along\nwith an environmental risk assessment,\nshould be collated and published in a peer-\nreviewed scientific journal. \n\u2022 More detailed models should be used to\nassess the highest likely environmental con-\ncentrations of OC and associated anti-\nmicrobials both in STPs and in catchments\nknown to have low dilution. \nREFERENCES\nAccinelli C, Caracciolo AB, Grenni P. 2007.
