INTRODUCTION\nStochastic resonance ~SR! has been the subject of inten-\nsive investigation over the last decade: for recent reviews see\n@1,2#. The idea of SR was originally introduced @3,4# in re-\nlation to a noise-induced enhancement of the amplitude of a\nlow frequency periodic signal in a bistable system. It was\nsubsequently realized @5,6#, however, that a stronger defini-\ntion of SR in the same system was also possible: it was\nshown that, for small enough signals, not only the signal\namplitude but also the signal-to-noise ratio ~SNR! could in-\ncrease with noise intensity ~temperature! within a certain\nrange. It is this latter definition of SR that is probably now\nthe more widely used and accepted, and which we will apply\nbelow.\nA general theory of SR, not confined to the conventional\nbistable case @6#, was introduced in @7#. It was predicted @8,9#\non this basis that SR could also occur in monostable systems\n@10#. In this perception of the phenomenon, SR is to be an-\nticipated in any system whose fluctuation spectrum in the\nabsence of a periodic signal displays at least one narrow peak\nthat grows quickly enough with increasing noise intensity. In\nthe particular case considered in @8,9#, the SR was associated\nwith zero-dispersion peaks @12\u201315# in systems whose eigen-\nfrequency as a function of energy possesses an extremum: to\ndistinguish it from conventional bistable SR, it was named\nzero-dispersion stochastic resonance ~ZDSR!.\nUnfortunately, the model analyzed in @8,9#, the tilted\nsingle-well Duffing oscillator, typically requires such very\nsmall values of the damping parameter that SR ~in terms of\n*Permanent address: Research Institute for Metrological Service,\nOzernaya 46, 119361 Moscow, Russia.\n\u2020Permanent address: Institute of Semiconductor Physics, Ukrai-\nnian National Academy of Sciences, Kiev, Ukraine.571063-651X\/98\/57~1!\/78~10!\/$15.00the strong definition above! could not be demonstrated in the\nanalog electronic experiments @9#. It was noted in @15#, how-\never, that a model superconducting quantum interference de-\nvice ~SQUID! appeared to be much more promising, in this\nrespect, because ZDSR was to be anticipated for consider-\nably larger damping values. Our recent investigations @16#\nhave confirmed this hypothesis, both experimentally and\ntheoretically. In the present work, not only has the general\ntheory of ZDSR been developed in detail, but we have also\nbeen able to investigate some interesting features of ZDSR\nthat are peculiar to SQUIDs. The results could be of interest\nin terms of applications, given that SQUIDs are frequently\nused in practical devices @17#. It will become apparent that\nZDSR can in principle be used to enhance the output SNR of\na SQUID at moderate and high frequencies, in very much the\nsame way as conventional SR has already been used to en-\nhance the output SNR of multistable SQUIDs @18# in the\nlow-frequency range.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. General expres-\nsions for the SNR in terms of the fluctuation spectrum, and\nthe asymptotic theory of ZDSR, are presented in Sec. II. The\ngeneral theory of fluctuation spectra for underdamped mo-\ntion is developed in Sec. III. Analog electronic experiments\non a SQUID model, and their results, are described in Sec.\nIV. In Sec. V they are compared with the theory and dis-\ncussed. The work is summarized and conclusions drawn in\nSec. VI.\nII. THEORY OF ZERO-DISPERSION STOCHASTIC\nRESONANCE\nLet us consider a one-dimensional oscillator subject to a\nweak periodic force, and to friction and noise which, for the\nsake of convenience, we take to be linear and white, respec-\ntively,78 \u00a9 1998 The American Physical Society\n57 79ZERO-DISPERSION STOCHASTIC RESONANCE IN A . . .q\u00a8 1Gq\u02d9 1\ndU\ndq 5 f ~ t !1Acos~Vt !,\n^ f ~ t !&50, ^ f ~ t ! f ~ t8!&52GTd~ t2t8!, ~1!\nwhere U(q) is a potential, and the noise intensity T corre-\nsponds to temperature in cases where the noise is of thermal\norigin. We introduce the SNR @6# in terms of the power\nspectrum,\nQ~v!5 lim\nt!`\n~4pt!21U E\n2t\nt\ndt q~ t !exp~ ivt !U2. ~2!\nQ(v) consists of d spikes at the frequency V of the periodic\nforce, and its harmonics, superimposed on a smooth fluctua-\ntional background that corresponds to the power spectrum\nQ (0)(v) in the absence of the periodic force. The SNR is\nthen defined as the ratio of the intensity ~square! of the d\nspike at V to the fluctuational background at V @6#, so that\nR5 Id~V!\nQ ~0 !~V!\n. ~3!\nAs shown in @7#, the SNR ~R! can be written in terms of the\ncomplex susceptibility which, in turn, can be expressed in\nterms of Q (0)(V) using the fluctuation dissipation theorem\nand the Kramers-Kronig relations\nR5 14 A\n2ux~V!u2\/Q ~0 !~V! ,\nRe @x~V!#5\n2\nT PE0\n`\nda S a2\na22V2\nD Q ~0 !~a!, ~4!\nIm @x~V!#5\npV\nT Q\n~0 !~V!,\nwhere P denotes the Cauchy principal part and\nQ ~0 !~V!5 1\np\nReE\n0\n`\ndt exp~2iVt !Q\u02dc ~ t !, ~5!\nQ\u02dc ~ t !5\u008a@q~ t !2^q&#@q~0 !2^q&#\u008b\nis the power spectrum in the absence of the periodic force.\nIt was shown in @8# that the SNR can increase with T if\nQ (0)(V) has a tall narrow peak that rises rapidly with T and\nif the frequency V of the driving force lies within the range\nof the peak. Just such a situation can be realized for under-\ndamped oscillators for which the dependence of an eigenos-\ncillation frequency on energy possesses an extremum. The\nderivative of the eigenfrequency with respect to energy,\ndv(E)\/dE ~the \u2018\u2018dispersion\u2019\u2019 of the eigenfrequency!, is\nequal to zero at the extremum. Correspondingly, energy fluc-\ntuations near the extremal energy, Em , affect the phase much\nless than in other energy ranges, so that the correlation of the\nphase ~and of the coordinate oscillations as well! lasts much\nlonger. Consequently, Q (0)(V) exhibits a tall narrow peak in\nthe vicinity of the extremal eigenfrequency vm[v(Em), theso-called zero-dispersion peak ~ZDP! @12,13# which, for\nsmall enough G , is described by the asymptotic formula\nQ ~0 !~V!5Q ~ZDP!~V!5Cscale SS V2vmDv D ,\nwhere\nS~x !5uRe@ S\u02dc~x !#u,\n~6!\nS\u02dc~x !5E\n0\n`\ndt\nexp~2ixt!\n$~12i !sinh@~12i !t#%1\/2\n,\nand Cscale and Dv are frequency-independent scale factors,\nCscale5\n4Apuq1mu2\nvm~ uv9u!3\/4\nexp~2Em \/T !\nZ~GTq\u02d9 m\n2\u00af !1\/4\n,\nDv5sgn~v9!~Guv9uTq\u02d9 m\n2 !1\/2, ~7!\nv9[\nd2v~Em!\ndEm\n2 ,\nwhere v(E) is the frequency of an eigenoscillation as a func-\ntion of its energy,\nE5\n1\n2q\n\u02d9\n21U~q !, ~8!\nand Em is the energy at which v(E) has an extremum,\nZ52pE\nUmin\n`\ndE\nexp~2E\/T !\nv~E ! ~9!\nis the partition function, Umin is the minimum value of U(q),\nq\u02d9 m\n2\u00af is q\u02d9 2 averaged over one period of the motion when\nE5Em , and q1m[q1(Em) is the first Fourier component in\nthe expansion of q as a periodic function of angle f @19# at\nthe energy Em ,\nq5 (\nn52`\n`\nqn~E !exp~2inf!. ~10!\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the function S(x) has an asymmetric\npeak whose height, half-width, and position have character-\nistic values of order unity.\nEquations ~6!\u2013~10! are valid provided that ~i! the ZDP is\nwell separated from other characteristic peaks in the spec-\ntrum; ~ii! there is a homogeneous population of the relevant\nenergy band around Em ; ~iii! the ZDP is larger than the\nrelaxational plateau of the spectrum. Thus the conditions for\nthe validity of Eqs. ~6!\u2013~10! are ~cf., @13#!\nU Dv\nmin~vm ,uvm2v iu!\nU,U Dv\nv9T2\nU1\/2!1,\n2uDvu&sgn~v9!~V2vm!!uv9uT2, ~11!\n80 57I. KH.

Consequently, the SNR must increase with T within\nsome range @20#, just as in the case of SR in conventional\nbistable systems @5\u20137,1#. The same holds true even when the\nshape of the ZDP is not universal. The only condition is that\nthe magnitude of the ZDP should be sufficiently large in\ncomparison to other spectral peaks @8#. The activation-law\ntype dependence of the SNR on T arises because both the\nsusceptibility and fluctuation spectrum are determined by\nthose oscillator vibrations whose energies lie within a narrow\nband around the extremal frequency, whose population in-\ncreases rapidly with T .\nThe frequency dependence of the SNR is well described\nby the universal function R , but only for very small values of\nG and in the close vicinity of vm ~see Sec. V!; the same\nrestrictions apply also to the shape of the ZDP itself @13,15#.\nIn order to calculate the SNR over a wider range of param-\neters, it is necessary to compute the fluctuation spectrum\nnumerically. The algorithm we have used for this calculation\nis described in the next section.\nIII. THEORY OF FLUCTUATION SPECTRA\nFOR UNDERDAMPED MOTION\nAn efficient algorithm for the calculation of fluctuation\nspectra in underdamped oscillators was developed in @21#,\nbut was restricted to systems with single-well potentials. Be-\ncause the potential that describes the dynamics of SQUIDs\ncan be of either the single-well or multiwell type, it is nec-\nessary to generalize the method of @21# to treat the case\nwhere the potential may also have one or more local barriers.\nOur aim, therefore, is to calculate Q (0)(V), i.e., the fluc-\ntuation spectrum ~5! of the coordinate q whose dynamics is\ngoverned by Eq. ~1! with A50. It is convenient to start from\nthe Fokker-Planck equation ~FPE! for the probability density\nw(q ,p ,t;q0 ,p0 ,0) of a transition in the space of coordinates\nq and momenta p[q\u02d9 from the point (q0 ,p0) occupied at\ntime zero to the point (q ,p) occupied at time t ~see, e.g.,\n@22#!,\n]w\n]t\n52\n]\n]q ~pw !1\n]\n]p S dU~q !dq w D1GL\u02c6 w ,\nL\u02c6 51\n]\n]p p1T\n]2\n]p2\n, w[w~q ,p ,t;q0 ,p0 ,0!, ~13!\nw~q ,p ,0;q0 ,p0 ,0!5d~q2q0!d~p2p0!.\nAccording to the definition ~5!, we can express the time cor-\nrelation function Q\u02dc (t) in terms of w(q ,p ,t;q0 ,p0 ,0) and the\nstationary distribution wst(q0 ,p0) as\nQ\u02dc ~ t !5E\n2`\n` E\n2`\n`\ndq dp ~q2^q&!W\u02dc ~q ,p ,t !,\n57 81ZERO-DISPERSION STOCHASTIC RESONANCE IN A . . .W\u02dc ~q ,p ,t !5E\n2`\n` E\n2`\n`\ndq0 dp0 ~q02^q&!\n3w~q ,p ,t;q0 ,p0 ,0!wst~q0 ,p0!, ~14!\nwst~q ,p !5Z21exp~2E\/T !.\nLike w(q ,p ,t;q0 ,p0 ,0), the function W\u02dc (q ,p ,t) satisfies the\nFPE ~13!, but with a different initial condition\nW\u02dc ~q ,p ,0!5~q2^q&!wst~q ,p !. ~15!\nFor further analysis, it is convenient to rewrite Eq. ~13! in an\nenergy-angle representation @19# and to make a half Fourier\ntransform with respect to time. Unlike the single-well case\n@21#, however, the energy-angle representation must be dif-\nferently defined in different regions of the phase space, di-\nvided by separatrices corresponding to the barrier energy lev-\nels @cf.

It forms the central element of a radio-frequency\nSQUID, is often used in more complicated SQUID devices\n@17#, and, as we shall see, may be expected to display ZDSR\nfor an appropriate choice of parameters.\nThe dynamics of the loop is described in many cases by\nthe resistively shunted model, in terms of which the time\nevolution of the phase of the order parameter, or of the mag-\nnetic flux F(t) threading the loop, can @17# be described by\nthe equationLC\nd2q\ndt2\n1\nL\nRN\ndq\ndt 1q1bsin~q !5qe ,\nq52p\nF\nF0\n, qe52p\nFe\nF0\n, b5\n2pLJc\nF0\n. ~23!\nHere F is the full magnetic flux through the loop; Fe is the\nflux of the external magnetic field; F05h\/2e is the flux\nquantum; L is the inductance of the loop; and C , RN , and\nJc are, respectively, the capacitance, normal resistivity, and\ncritical supercurrent of the junction.\nThe external flux usually includes a noisy component\nFN(t), to which can formally be added an additional contri-\nbution due to thermal fluctuations within the loop itself and\nto noise in the Josephson junction. In addition, there is often\na constant component Fdc and a small periodic signal\nFscos(vst). We will therefore assume that\nFe[Fe~t!5Fdc1Fscos~vst!1FN~t!, ~24!\n^FN~t!FN~t8!&52Dd~t2t8!.\nTaking account of Eq. ~24! and introducing the normalized\nvariables\nt5vpt , G5\n1\nvpRNC\n, V5\nvs\nvp\n,\nA5\nFs\nLJc\n, qdc5\n2pFdc\nF0\n,\nT5\n2pDRN\nF0L2Jc\n, vp5S 2pJcCF0 D\n1\/2\n, ~25!\nEq. ~23! takes the same form as Eq. ~1!, with\nU~q !5\nB\n2 ~q2qdc!\n22cos~q !, B[\n1\nb\n. ~26!\nThe frequency of eigenoscillations in the potential U(q) of\nEq. ~26! possesses extrema as a function of energy if B&1\n~Fig. 4!. Consequently, the system should display the full\nrange of zero-dispersion phenomena including, in particular,\nZDSR. The criterion for the smallness of the amplitude of\nthe periodic signal can in practice easily be found experi-\nmentally by finding the maximum amplitude for which the\nresponse is linear.\nThe circuit used to model Eqs. ~1! and ~26!, shown in\noutline by the block diagram of Fig. 5, was designed accord-\ning to a standard prescription @27,28#, using operational am-\nplifiers, an analog multiplier @29#, and a trigonometric inte-\ngrated circuit ~IC! @30# to perform the necessary\nmathematical operations. In the diagram A8cosV8t8 and\nf 8(t8) are, respectively, a signal and an external noise ap-\nplied to the underdamped nonlinear oscillator. A8 is the am-\nplitude of the signal in volts, f 8(t8) is the value of the noise\nvoltage applied to the circuit, and V8 and t8 are the real\nfrequency and time. Setting to zero the total currents at the\ninputs of the operational amplifiers whose outputs are VA and\nVB , respectively, we obtain\n57 83ZERO-DISPERSION STOCHASTIC RESONANCE IN A . . .VA\nRG\n1C1\ndVA\ndt8\n1\nf 8~ t8!\nRN\n1\nA8cos~V8t8!\nRF\n2\n~R5 \/R4!VB\nR2\n1\nVD\nR1\n50, ~27!\nC2\ndVB\ndt8\n1\nVA\nR3\n50. ~28!\nThe trigonometric IC was configured to give an output of\n10sin@50(y12y2)# where the two inputs y1 and y2 are in\nvolts and the argument of the sine is in degrees. The IC\noperation is restricted to lie within the range 6500\u00b0. In order\nto increase the dynamic range of q @see Eq. ~26!# encom-\npassed by the model, an analog multiplier was used as shown\nto convert the argument to the double angle. The voltage at\nits output, in terms of the voltage VC at the input of the\ntrigonometric IC and the constant voltages V1 and V2, and\nallowing for internal scaling by a factor of 0.1, is\nVD50.1$10sin@50~V12VC!#%21V2 ~29!\nor, in terms of the double angle, now expressed in radians,\nFIG. 4.

However, for such\nsmall damping, the actual value usually differs from the\nnominal one due to the effects of stray capacitance and other\nnonidealities of the circuit. In the present case, the actual\nvalue, measured experimentally by two independent methods\n@15#, was found to be G50.0012 for the multiwell case and\nG50.0011 for the single-well case.\nThe circuit model was driven by noise from a feedback\nshift-register noise generator @27,31# and by a sinusoidal pe-\nriodic force from a Hewlett-Packard model 3325B frequency\nsynthesizer. The response of the circuit to stochastic and pe-\nriodic forces was analyzed with the aid of a Microstar\nDAP3200a\/415 ADC card @32# installed in a Pentium 133\npersonal computer.\nThe evolution of the fluctuation spectra with increasing\nnoise intensity was measured for the two cases of a single-\nwell and a multiwell potential ~with four wells! as shown in\nFigs. 3~a! and 3~b!. The results are shown in Fig. 6.\nThe SNR was calculated as a function of both noise in-\ntensity and signal frequency, for both single-well and multi-\nwell cases, yielding the results shown in Fig. 7. The depen-\ndences of the SNR on T for fixed V , and on V for fixed T ,\nboth measured and calculated, are shown in Figs. 8 and 9,\nrespectively.\nV. DISCUSSION\nIt is immediately evident from the results of Figs. 7 and 8\nthat a substantial noise-induced increase in the SNR can oc-\ncur for the SQUID model: note the satisfactory agreement\nbetween the theory and the analog experimental data ~Fig. 8!.\nIt is to be expected, therefore, that underdamped SQUIDs\nwill display closely similar behavior.\nThe special features of ZDSR peculiar to SQUIDs are\nclosely related to corresponding features in their fluctuation\nspectra which, in turn, are determined by the characteristic\nform of v(E). The latter may have several extrema, as\nshown in Fig. 4. Thus there could be several ZDPs corre-\nsponding to the different extrema. They become activated\nsequentially with increasing T . This is most clearly seen in\nthe single-well case where the extremal frequencies are well\nseparated. The higher the extremal energy, the higher the\nnoise intensity at which the spectral contribution from a ZDP\nbecomes comparable with those from other energy ranges.\nAt the same time, the higher the extremal energy E , the\nlarger the amplitude of the oscillations and, in most cases,\nthe flatter v(E) becomes. The latter effect broadens the\nrange of energies that contribute significantly to the ZDP\n@12,13,15# and causes the correlation time of the oscillation\nto lengthen. Taken together, the two effects result in the\nmaximum magnitude of each successive ZDP increasing\nmarkedly @cf. Fig. 6~a!#.\nIn the case of a multiwell potential (B!1), most of the\nextremal eigenfrequencies are very close to each other ~all'B1\/2). Thus, in addition to the increase in magnitude of\neach successive partial ZDP, many of the ZDPs will overlap;\nand the higher the noise intensity, the greater the number of\noverlapping peaks. Thus the noise-induced increase in the\nmagnitude of the spectral peak is especially pronounced in\nthe multiwell case. As shown by the analysis of Cscale ~7! for\nsmall B , the maximum magnitude of the peak grows as B\ndecreases, as }B23\/2, until it reaches the limit ;G21.\nLet us now turn to the signal-to-noise ratio. As discussed\nin Sec. II, if a ZDP in the spectrum Q (0)(V) dominates over\nother contributions to the spectrum in the vicinity of vm then\nthe SNR is proportional to Cscale \/T2 in the vicinity of vm ,\nwhich provides a resonance-like dependence of the SNR on\nT: it first sharply increases with T , like the ZDP magnitude,\nand then, when the temperature becomes of the order of Em ,\nthe sharp growth of Cscale with T saturates and the increase\nof the SNR changes into a slow decrease. Although the spec-\ntrum in a SQUID typically manifests more than one ZDP,\nand the ZDPs often overlap ~cf. Fig. 6!, the dependence of\nthe SNR on T may still be characterized qualitatively\n~though not quantitatively! by Eq. ~12! using parameters of\nthat extremum of v(E) corresponding to the ZDP which\ndominates within the relevant ranges of temperature and fre-\nquency. Figure 8 demonstrates resonancelike dependences of\nthe SNR on T . The rapid increase of the SNR as T decreases\nat small T occurs because the SNR is determined at small\ntemperatures by oscillations near the bottom of the lowest\npotential well, resulting in a dependence proportional to T21.\nThus, when the signal frequency is close to one of the ex-\ntreme eigenfrequencies, the temperature dependence of the\nSNR is very similar to that for conventional SR @5,6,1,2#.\nIt should be emphasized that an increase of SNR with T\nwould still have been observed, even if the damping constant\nhad been considerably larger than the value (G;1023) used\nin the present experiments: the relevant criterion for G can be\nwritten approximately as\nG!B1\/2&1 ~34!\nor, in terms of SQUID parameters,\nRN@~L\/C !1\/2, b*1. ~35!\nA characteristic feature of the frequency dependence of\nthe SNR in a SQUID is its rapid increase in the direction of\na ZDP\u2019s steepest decrease. The reason is that the real part of\nthe susceptibility ~and also uxu2) decreases much more\nslowly than the spectral density @c.f. Eq. ~12!#. As a rule, the\nSNR passes through a maximum and then decreases again.\nThe physical reason is that the spectral density is then being\ndetermined by energy regions far from the extremal energy:\nthe SNR increase therefore saturates and changes to a de-\ncrease as the signal frequency moves even further away from\nthe extremal eigenfrequency. Note that the frequency range\nwithin which the SNR increases is typically much larger than\nthe width of the associated ZDP itself.\nThe frequency dependence of the SNR is described quite\nwell by our numerical algorithm, as can be seen in Fig. 9. In\nFig. 9~a!, which corresponds to the monostable SQUID, the\nleft ~sharply decreasing! section of the dependence is mostly\ndue to the minimum of v(E) at about 0.4; the left wing of\nthe peak is mostly due to the ZDP at V'0.6 while the right\n57 85ZERO-DISPERSION STOCHASTIC RESONANCE IN A . . .FIG. 6.

Dash-dotted lines mark the positions of the\nrelevant extrema of v(E) ~see Fig. 4!.~decreasing! wing of the peak is due to the relaxational pla-\nteau dominating in the spectrum at these frequencies. Figure\n9~b!, which corresponds to the multistable SQUID, exhibits\ntwo peaks in the SNR. The left-hand wing of the right-hand\npeak is associated with the ZDP near V50.38, whereas the\nopposite wing of this peak is associated with the intrawell\npeak of the spectrum. The decrease of the SNR as the fre-\nquency decreases changes at V'0.3 into an increase, con-\ntrary to Eq. ~12!, because the spectrum in this range of fre-\nquencies is governed by energies close to one of the barrier\nlevels where the parabolic approximation is inapplicable and\nthe spectrum decreases much more rapidly than predicted by\nEq. ~6!. The opposite wing of this peak of the SNR depen-\ndence is associated with the zero-frequency peak of the spec-\ntrum @33#.\nThus, the frequency dependence of the SNR in ZD oscil-\nFIG. 7.

KAUFMAN et al.lators quite generally displays a resonantlike behavior, in\ncontrast to the behavior of the SNR in conventional systems.\nAt the same time, the width of each resonance is generally\nmuch larger than the band of frequencies within which con-\nventional SR is manifested in overdamped SQUIDs.\nFinally, in this section, we comment that the extremal\nfrequencies can be varied over a wide range by adjustment of\nthe parameters B and qdc , i.e., by changing the inductance or\ncritical supercurrent and the external magnetic field.\nVI.

This ZDSR phenom-\nenon arises in SQUIDs because of extrema in the depen-\ndence of their frequencies of eigenoscillation on energy\nwhich give rise, in turn, to characteristic asymmetric zero-\ndispersion peaks in the fluctuation spectrum whose magni-\ntude sharply increases with temperature. Thus the increase of\nSNR can be very large ~infinite, in the limit of zero dissipa-\ntion!. The SNR also exhibits a rapid increase with changing\nfrequency in the direction of the steepest decrease of the\nassociated ZDP; and this increase usually occurs over a\nbroader range of frequencies than the width of the ZDP it-\nself. The evolution of fluctuation spectra with increasing\nnoise intensity takes place through sequential activation of\nthe zero-dispersion peaks corresponding to different extrema\nFIG. 9.

Thus, the SNR increase can take place over a\nwide range of signal frequencies and SQUID parameters; the\nSQUID can be designed to suit a given signal frequency\nthrough adjustment of its inductance or critical supercurrent,\nand also tuned by varying the external magnetic field.\nGiven that a superconductive loop with a Josephson junc-\ntion constitutes the central element of a radio-frequency\nSQUID and of a variety of other SQUID-based devices, it is\nclear that ZDSR could in principle be used to improve the\nSNR at the output in many such applications. It should be\nnoted also that an investigation of ZDSR in arrays of under-\ndamped SQUIDs could be of interest, given that the coupling\nhas been shown @34# to enhance the SNR for conventional\nSR in arrays of overdamped SQUIDs.\nFinally, note that in the course of the work we have alsoobtained, as byproducts, two useful results: ~a! a universal\nasymptotic function ~12! describing the SNR in any ZD sys-\ntem, valid for the limit of a small dissipation; and ~b! a\nconvenient method for the numerical computation of fluctua-\ntion spectra in underdamped bistable and multistable sys-\ntems, as a generalization of the method developed earlier for\nthe monostable case @21#.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work was supported by the Engineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council ~UK!, by the Royal Society of\nLondon, by the International Science Foundation under\nGrant Nos.
