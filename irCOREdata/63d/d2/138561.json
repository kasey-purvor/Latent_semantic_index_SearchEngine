In\naddition, inventory was a common risk mitigation strategy against the possibility of\nrandom demand variability and transportation delays. Based on these findings, an\nexploratory framework was developed to integrate such factors as inventory reduction\nstrategies, risk management and inventory control theory.\nResearch limitations \/ implications \u2013 Further research is required to develop this\nexploratory framework in more detail so that it can help practitioners arrive at the\nmost appropriate solutions. It is proposed that this is conducted initially in the fast\nmoving consumer goods or retail sectors, so as to build on this research, and that this\nshould include the upstream supply networks. Other types of industry sectors should\nthen be explored.\n4Practical implications \u2013 It is intended that the exploratory framework put forward in\nthis paper can form the basis for further research in the area and to develop useful\ntools for practitioners.\nOriginality \/ value \u2013 The literatures on inventory control theory and inventory\nreduction strategies have been largely separate to date. The findings of this paper lead\nto an exploratory framework to start to bring these areas together.\nKeywords Inventory; Warehousing; International supply chains; Supply chain risk.\nClassification Research paper\n5Introduction\nInventory holding and warehousing continue to play an important role in modern\nsupply chains. A survey of logistics costs in Europe identified the cost of inventory as\nbeing 13% of total logistics costs, whilst warehousing accounted for a further 24%\n(European Logistics Association\/AT Kearney, 2004). A similar study in the USA,\nfound inventory costs significantly higher at 24%, with warehousing, at 22%, being\nclose to the European figure (Establish\/Davis, 2005). As well as being significant in\ncost terms, they are important in terms of customer service, with product availability\nbeing a key service metric and warehousing being critical to the success or failure of\nmany supply chains (Frazelle, 2002a).\nThe role of inventory as a buffer against uncertainty has been established for a long\ntime. However, more recently, the disadvantages of holding inventory have been\nincreasingly recognised, particularly with regard to the adverse impact that this may\nhave on supply chain responsiveness. This discussion can naturally be extended to\nthe role of warehouses, as one of the prime raisons d\u2019\u00eatre of warehouses has\ntraditionally been to hold inventory. The aim of this paper is to investigate the precise\nroles of inventories and warehouses by means of case studies in order to provide a\ndeeper understanding of these roles and to develop an exploratory framework that\nmay be used in this respect.\nThe role of inventories\nIncreasing globalisation has tended to lead to longer supply lead-times, which, by\nconventional inventory control theory, result in greater levels of inventory to provide\n6the same service levels (Waters, 2002). The impact is normally recognised as\noccurring with regard to safety stock, with the amount of this stock increasing in a\nsquare root relationship to the lead-time. In addition, with more distant supply lines,\nthere is also the possibility of an increasing variation in the supply lead-time and this\nwould further increase the amount of safety stock. A further factor is the transport\neconomics of long distance movements whereby there may be significant cost\neconomies achievable by despatching in larger quantities (e.g. full container loads)\nand this would tend to increase cycle stocks. This relationship between the use of\noffshore sourcing strategies and the resultant increased inventory levels has been\ndemonstrated by Lowson (2002).\nHowever, there has been some concern about the true costs of inventory and whether\ncompanies do in fact recognise these fully. For example, Christopher (2005)\nhighlights costs such as storage, obsolescence, damage, deterioration, shrinkage,\ninsurance and management costs, as well as the more traditional cost of capital. With\nan incorrect assessment of inventory costs, there is the danger that companies may\nmake inaccurate supply chain trade-offs in this respect and therefore hold too much\ninventory (Lee and Billington, 1992).\nIn lean supply chain thinking, inventory is regarded as one of the seven \u2018wastes\u2019 and\ntherefore it is considered as something to be reduced as much as possible (Womack\nand Jones, 1996). Similarly, in agile supply chains, inventory is held at few echelons,\nif at all (Van Hoek et al., 2001), with goods passing through supply chains quickly so\nthat companies can respond rapidly to exploit changes in market demand (Christopher\nand Towill, 2001). There have been various supply chain taxonomies based on these\n7concepts and most stress the need for inventory reduction within each of the\nclassifications. For example, Vonderembse et al., (2006, p. 229) state that a lean\nsupply chain \u201cgenerates high (inventory) turns and minimises inventory throughout\nthe chain\u201d, in an agile supply chain companies \u201cmake in response to customer\ndemand\u201d, and in a hybrid supply chain companies \u201cpostpone product differentiation\nand mimimize functional components inventory\u201d. There is thus an emphasis on\ninventory reduction in each of these supply chain classifications.\nNevertheless, there is a recognition that inventory can play a key part in lean and agile\nthinking. The holding of \u2018strategic inventory\u2019 at decoupling points can act as a buffer,\nseparating lean production activities from an agile response to volatile market places\n(Christopher and Towill, 2001). Customer orders can thus be satisfied from this\ninventory, enabling lean principles to be applied to the manufacturing process, based\non a more level production schedule. The production and movement of goods is\ngenerally forecast-driven up to the decoupling point and then driven by actual demand\norders downstream from the decoupling point (Christopher, 2000). This type of\nstructure is necessary when the supply lead-time is greater than the demand lead-time\n(Harrison and van Hoek, 2005), as in such cases production cannot be based on actual\ncustomer orders.\nWhilst inventories provide some security against fluctuations in the level of customer\ndemand, there is concern that they may reduce the ability of supply chains to respond\nto changes in the nature of that demand. Inventories in international supply chains\nmay therefore act as a buffer against one risk whilst increasing another type of risk.\nFor example, Etienne (2005) lists factors such as speed to market for new products,\n8responsiveness to new technology (leading to potential obsolescence of existing\ninventory), responsiveness to market niches, feedback time for quality issues, and\n\u201cfeed forward\u201d time (e.g. speed of signal to the market, through actual use, that the\nproduct has been improved). One conclusion of this latter paper is that \u201cinventory is a\nnet destroyer of supply chain responsiveness\u201d (p. 63).\nThe potential disadvantages of holding inventory are widely recognised and a number\nof inventory reducing strategies have been put forward. These include:\n\uf0a7 A reduction in production lead-times, for example, by means of shorter set-up\ntimes and smaller manufacturing runs (Harrison and van Hoek, 2005).\n\uf0a7 The use of production postponement, enabling inventory of common\ncomponents to be held rather than a multitude of finished goods lines (van\nHoek, 1998).\n\uf0a7 The visibility of end consumer demand to all supply chain participants, to\nreduce excess inventories caused by demand amplification up the supply chain\n(Christopher, 2005).\n\uf0a7 Total cycle time compression, in both information and material flow lead\ntimes (Mason-Jones and Towill, 1999).\n\uf0a7 The centralisation of inventory. For example, the level of safety stocks can be\nreduced by centralising inventory in a single European Distribution Centre\nrather than holding inventory in several National Distribution Centres\n(Sussams, 1986).\n\uf0a7 The virtual warehousing concept, whereby all inventory across many locations\nis regarded as one common inventory pool (Landers et al., 2000). This may be\n9associated with the transhipment of goods between warehouses at the same\nechelon level in the supply chain (Herer et al., 2002).\n\uf0a7 Cross-docking goods to speed the flow of goods through the supply chain\n(Apte and Viswanathan, 2000). In this sense, cross-docking is defined as\nreceiving goods at a warehouse and quickly transferring to despatch vehicles,\nwithout putting the goods away into stock.\nInventory has also been a subject in the debate on supply chain resilience, which has\nbeen of increasing interest in recent years, particularly as the \u201cleaning-down\u201d of\ncompanies and global sourcing have increased supply chain risks (Christopher and\nPeck, 2004). It is recognised that international supply chains may be particularly\nvulnerable owing to such factors as the geographic area covered, the transport modes\nused, political \/ border factors and environmental issues (Prater et al., 2001). Whilst\nrisk mitigation strategies may contain many elements, the use of inventory is\ngenerally recognised as one possible tool. For example, Chopra and Sodhi (2004,\np.60) list \u201cincrease inventory\u201d as a risk mitigation approach, whilst Christopher and\nPeck (2004, p.8) state that \u201cthe strategic disposition of additional capacity and\/or\ninventory at potential \u2018pinch points\u2019 can be extremely beneficial in the creation of\nresilience within the supply chain\u201d. Lee (2002) particularly emphasizes the role of\ninventory in situations of supply uncertainty.\nThere are thus widely varying views about the role of inventory in the literature and\nsome of these views appear to have conflicting goals. For example, the goal of\ntraditional inventory control theory has been the optimisation of inventory levels,\nwhereas the goal discussed in more recent thinking, such as that on lean and agile\n10\nsupply chains, has concentrated more on the minimisation of inventory levels.\nHowever, the latter has been counteracted to some extent by the understanding of the\nrole of decoupling points and the part that inventory may play in some risk mitigation\nstrategies. Whilst the minimisation of inventory is widely discussed, this needs to be\ndefined and there is a recognition that resources can be reduced too much, leading to\nterms such as \u201ccorporate anorexia\u201d (Radnor and Boaden, 2004). This suggests that\nthere is in fact an optimum level of inventory. However, the identification of this\nlevel needs to involve wider concepts than those just associated with traditional\ninventory control theory.\nThe role of warehouses\nA questioning of the role of inventory naturally also tends to question the role of\nwarehouses, as inventory holding and the servicing of customer orders from that\ninventory are key warehouse functions. This key role is recognised by most textbooks\nthat cover warehousing (e.g. Ackerman and Brewer, 2001, Frazelle, 2002b, and\nRushton et al., 2006).\nOther roles for warehouses are being seen as increasingly important as they change\nfrom \u201cholding yards\u201d to \u201cswitching yards\u201d (Drucker, 1992). In this context,\nHigginson and Bookbinder (2005) list the roles of distribution centres as:\n\uf0a7 Make-bulk \/ break-bulk consolidation centres, in order to consolidate customer\norders together into one delivery and gain transport economies.\n\uf0a7 Cross-dock centres, whereby customer orders are satisfied from another source\n(e.g. a manufacturing plant) and just pass through the distribution centre\nwithin a few hours (or a couple of days at the most).\n11\n\uf0a7 Transshipment facilities, which are used to change transport mode (e.g. from\nlarge line-haul vehicles to smaller delivery vehicles).\n\uf0a7 Assembly facilities, where the final configuration of the product to individual\ncustomer requirements can take place.\n\uf0a7 Product-fulfilment centres, responding directly to product orders from the final\nconsumer (e.g. as Internet fulfilment operations).\n\uf0a7 Returned goods depots, handling unwanted and damaged goods, as well as\ngoods returning under environmental legislation such as for product recovery\nand packaging waste.\n\uf0a7 Miscellaneous roles, such as customer support, installation and repair services.\nA number of these roles may be associated with some of the concepts mentioned\nearlier, such as agility, production postponement, and time compression. These are\ngenerally recognised as increasing trends in warehousing (Maltz and DeHoratius,\n2004). However, a survey of large warehouses in the United Kingdom indicated that\nover 50% of the floor area is generally taken up by storage, with most of the\nremaining area being used for the associated goods-in, order picking, packing and\ndespatch activities (Baker, 2004). In that survey, although value-added activities took\nplace in over 70% of the warehouses, they only accounted for about 5% of the floor\narea. These activities were thus relatively minor in nature and normally occurred as\npart of the pick and pack process. Similarly, cross-docking was rather limited in\nnature with 74% of the warehouses cross-docking 5% or less of their throughput.\nInventory holding is thus still a key role of warehouses in modern supply chains.\n12\nThe continuing importance of inventory holding, and associated warehousing, appears\nto warrant further research, particularly as the literature is somewhat equivocal on\nthese subjects.\nIn spite of the steps taken to reduce inventories in many companies, inventory holding\nand warehousing continue to be very significant components of modern supply\nchains. The literature provides some very useful, but sometimes contradictory,\ninsights into these components. In the light of this, a greater understanding is required\nas to how these elements link together, so that a framework can be developed of how\nto examine these components.\nResearch method\nA case study approach was adopted for this research in order to gain a fuller\nunderstanding of the nature of any inventories held, as well as the precise functions of\nthe warehouses used. In order to limit the scope of the research within this wide area,\nthis exploratory research focuses on outbound distribution (i.e. post manufacturing)\nand covers a limited number of companies representing both manufacturers and\nretailers.\nSix companies participated in the research and these were drawn from the following\nindustry sectors. The number of supply chains examined for each company is shown\nin brackets:\n\uf0a7 Agricultural supplies manufacturer (2 supply chains). A major global agri-\nbusiness, with operations in over 90 countries worldwide.\n13\n\uf0a7 Automotive component manufacturer (1 supply chain). A Japanese\nheadquartered multi-national company, with manufacturing centres in Japan,\nNorth America and Europe.\n\uf0a7 Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) manufacturer (2 supply chains). A\ndivision of a major multi-national food manufacturing company.\n\uf0a7 Fast moving consumer goods manufacturer (2 supply chains). A manufacturer\nof non-food items, with sales to retailers and distributors in over 150 countries.\n\uf0a7 Retail chain, departmental stores (2 supply chains). A leading retail chain\nwith over 20 department stores in the UK.\n\uf0a7 Retail chain, apparel and footwear stores (2 supply chains, each sub-divided\ninto two). A leading fashion store chain with over 200 shops in the UK. For\nthis company, a proportion of each fashion line is \u2018pushed\u2019 directly out to\nstores, whilst the remainder is held back at the UK distribution centre for\nsubsequent replenishment to restock the stores when particular sizes or colours\nare sold. These two operations give distinctly different pipeline maps and are\ntherefore regarded separately for the purposes of this analysis.\nThis gave a total of thirteen supply chains examined within this research.\nThese six companies were selected as giving a reasonable representation of sectors to\ninclude industrial manufacturing (two different industries), FMCG manufacturing\n(food and non-food), and retail companies (two different sectors). Although this\nnumber does not give a comprehensive cross-section of industry sectors, it does\nprovide a balance between the desire to explore a variety of issues that may occur in\ndifferent sectors whilst being a manageable number to be able to examine the supply\n14\nchains in some detail. The number of supply chains to be examined was discussed\nwith the companies and two supply chains each were regarded as being sufficient to\ngain a useful insight into the nature of their international outward supply chains.\nThe research was introduced to the participating companies in face-to-face meetings:\none meeting with five of the companies in a group and one company individually.\nThe representatives of these companies were senior supply chain managers or\ndirectors, holding the following positions: European Distribution & Warehouse\nManager; General Manager (European Logistics); Logistics Director; Overseas\nPurchasing Manager; Project Manager (Supply Chain & Manufacturing\nDevelopment); and Supply Excellence Director.\nThe nature of the project and the research method was introduced to the participants,\nwho were then asked to select supply chains for particular product groups that they\nregarded as being \u2018typical\u2019 of their own international logistics operations. The\nthirteen supply chains selected by the participants comprised six sea routes (by\ncontainer) and seven road transport routes. The sea routes were primarily from Asia\nto Europe (with one being from the UK to USA), whilst the road transport routes were\ninternational supply chains across Europe. The supply chains were defined as being\nfrom the point of manufacture to the point of use (or to the store in the case of retail\ndeliveries) and thus extended outside the companies themselves. However, the\ninward supply chain of materials to manufacture was not examined, as this would\ngenerally have required authorisation outside the remit of the individual participants\nand would have involved the mapping of numerous material supply networks (which\n15\nwould be worthy of a study in its own right). The impact of raw material sourcing as\na potential source of risk and delay is thus not examined within this paper.\nFirst of all, the participants were asked to complete a pipeline map for the supply\nchain of each product group selected, showing the number of days of inventory held at\npoints along the chain, as well as in-transit inventory (e.g. whilst on ships or trucks).\nThis was undertaken using a Powerpoint template that was sent out by email. This\npipeline mapping method was selected as it is a well-established means of analysing\nlong and complex supply chains (for example, see Scott and Westbrook, 1991).\nA two-page questionnaire, for each of the selected supply chains, was also sent out to\nthe participants attached to the same email. This comprised questions about the\nnature of the supply chain, including lead-times, transit times, inventory levels, and\nthe purpose of inventory holdings and warehouses. In addition, questions were\nincluded on the sources of risk, extent of risk and avoidance actions taken (after\nSvensson, 2004). The severity of potential impact on the business and the likelihood\nof occurrence were measured on 5-point Likert scales. There was also an open ended\nquestion asking for views on whether inventory is primarily a source of risk or a\nmeans of risk mitigation.\nFurther information and clarification was then gained by face-to-face interviews,\ntelephone conversations and e-mail, as appropriate, to gain a fuller understanding of\nthe supply chains and the responses provided.\n16\nResults\nThe thirteen supply chains were mapped as per the example for the retail company\nshown in Figure 1. This particular chain involves road transport at each end, but also\nincludes rail transport from the consolidation point in India to the Indian port, and\nthen full-load seafreight container movements to the U.K. The pipeline map is drawn\nas per Scott and Westbrook (1991) with the movement of goods shown by horizontal\nlines and the holding of goods at any point in the supply chain shown by vertical lines.\nThe total of the figures associated with the two sets of arrows represents the total\npipeline inventory in the supply chain, including in-transit inventory and that at\nholding points en route. Two sets of total figures are given in this diagram. The first\nfigure, of 36 days of pipeline inventory, represents the initial \u2018push\u2019 of products to the\nstores, with goods only being held an average of 2 days at the UK distribution centre.\nThis just allowed time for sorting and for consolidating into the next load to the stores\n(as smaller stores were not served every day from the distribution centre). The second\nfigure, totalling 51 days of pipeline inventory, includes an average inventory holding\nof 17 days at the UK distribution centre for replenishment purposes.\n[Take in Figure 1]\nThe pipeline inventory levels for the thirteen supply chains are shown in Table I. For\nthe purposes of this table, any goods held at a port for activities closely allied to\ntransport (e.g. awaiting shipment or awaiting Customs clearance) are shown as\ninventory in transit. This enables the inventory held at warehouses to be analysed\nseparately. In line with this definition, the transit times varied from 45 days for a\nJapan to France supply chain (i.e. including the time at ports, awaiting shipment and\n17\nfor Customs clearance) to 4 days for some European movements. The warehouse\ninventory ranged from 54 days to 2 days.\n[Take in Table I]\nThe research is aimed at examining the nature of the inventory held at warehouses,\nand the purpose of each inventory holding point is shown in Table II. The table is\narranged so that the inventory buffer is shown as Warehouse C, with activities in\nwarehouses that occur prior to that shown as Warehouses A and B, and those after as\nWarehouse D. In general, the inventory buffer is just held at one point (except for the\nUK to S. Russia and UK to Italy supply chains, where safety stock is held by both the\nvendor and the buyer). In some supply chains, goods are shipped directly to the\ndecoupling point, whilst in others goods are held for a number of reasons first (e.g.\nawaiting for other goods to consolidate to full load containers or trailers, co-packing\nactivities to promotional \/ retailer packs, and palletising and feeding through to the\nmain inventory holding point in a smooth flow). At the downstream side, some goods\nwere shipped directly from the decoupling point to the point of use (or to the retail\nstore), whilst others passed through a subsequent warehouse (e.g. for delivery\nconsolidation, assembly line sequencing, and feeding on a quick response basis to\nindividual stores).\nFew value added services were noted by the participants, and that where these do\noccur they may be undertaken at external premises rather than at the main decoupling\npoint (as in the example of co-packing in the UK to Italy supply chain). Other\nparticipants had limited examples of value added services that just applied to a small\n18\nproportion of the throughput, such as the screen-printing of plain cotton tea-shirts or\nthe hanging, and ironing, of garments. However, again, in both these examples, the\nactivities were conducted by sub-contractors off-site. Although this particular\nresearch is not intended to be a wide representative sample, this is in line with the\nfindings of the survey in Baker (2004), in which relatively little floor area is given\nover to value added services in large warehouses. Although this research was not\ndesigned as a full value chain analysis, no instances of added value activities were\nidentified at the ports themselves, and this is an area that may warrant investigation in\nfurther research.\n[Take in Table II]\nThe need for inventory buffers in these supply chains is demonstrated by the wide\ndifference between the supplier lead-time and the customer lead-time, known as the\nlead-time gap (as per Harrison and van Hoek, 2005). These lead-times are shown in\nTable III. Some of the supplier lead-times are shown as ranges, representing the\nmanufacturing cycles. For example, in the UK to USA supply chain, the shortest\nsupplier lead time is 42 days for an order placed just before the 5-day manufacturing\ncycle is finalised, whilst the longest is 47 days. Similarly, some customer lead-times\nare shown as ranges, representing the different service levels offered (e.g. larger stores\nmay be on more frequent delivery schedules than smaller stores). Overall, the\nsupplier lead-times for the replenishment supply chains are about 14 times greater\nthan the customer lead-times. In these circumstances, it is very difficult for inventory\nreduction strategies to eliminate the need for safety stock.\n19\n[Take in Table III]\nConventional inventory control theory would suggest that the longer the supplier lead-\ntimes the greater would be the level of safety stock (subject to such conditions as\nsimilar service levels, lead-time variability, delivery frequency and customer demand\nvariability). The graph in Figure 2 broadly shows this relationship for the thirteen\nsupply chains that have been researched. The two low outlying points (at zero safety\nstock) are the two initial \u2018pushes\u2019 of new fashion lines into the stores. This shows the\nimportance of designing supply chains to reduce or eliminate inventory where such\nbusiness strategies are appropriate. The two high outlying points (at 30 and 35 days\nstock) are where there are two decoupling points in the supply chain, with both the\nvendor and buyer holding safety stock. This is in line with what may be expected\nwhere orders are passed from one level of the supply chain to another (for example, as\nmodelled by Forrester, 1961).\n[Take in Figure 2]\nThe respondents were asked to list the main supply chain risks that they perceived and\nto note the likely severity of the impact on the business, the likelihood of occurrence,\nand the risk mitigation strategies that they adopted. 5-point Likert scales were used to\nmeasure the impact on the business and the likelihood of occurrence, with mid-scores\nof 3 denoting a moderate impact on the business and being likely to occur about once\nper year, respectively (see Table IV for full description). The two main risk areas for\nthe selected international supply chains were those associated with variability in\ndemand and variability in lead-times.\n20\n[Take in Table IV]\nVariability in demand was listed as forecast inaccuracy, and it was recognised that\nthis may be either an over-estimation or under-estimation of demand. An over-\nestimation of demand led, in the words of the participants, to issues such as \u201cexcess\nstock\u201d, \u201cprice mark-downs\u201d and \u201cinventory write-offs\u201d, whilst an under-estimation of\ndemand led to such issues as \u201clost sales\u201d and \u201clost customers\u201d. On average, this was\nregarded as having a moderate to high impact on the business and likely to occur, to a\nsignificant degree, almost once per year.\nVariability in lead times was normally associated with shipping and road transport\ndelays. The impact on the business was regarded as being between moderate and very\nhigh, whilst the likelihood of occurrence varied quite widely. Some delay risks were\ngeneric (e.g. weather and accidents), whilst others were particular to specific types of\nsupply chain (e.g. the availability of hazard approved drivers, and regulatory delays in\nthe USA caused by security regulations). Transport delays, in the words of one\nrespondent, may lead to \u201cpoor availability, lost sales, loss of customer goodwill, and\nloss of customer confidence in the brand\u201d. For industrial customers, it could lead to\n\u201cproduction shut-downs\u201d.\nMultiple risk mitigation strategies were used, with the two most common strategies\nbeing the use of safety stock to buffer against these variations in demand or supply,\nand the use of collaboration with the various parties involved to work together to\nminimise the risks, or at least to be aware of them at an early stage. Actions such as\n21\nthe expediting of goods by airfreight may then be used to meet heavy demand or to\novercome shipping delays. Multiple sourcing was also used in some supply chains to\nmitigate the risks (see Table V).\nInterestingly, only one company mentioned the risk of substandard quality. For that\nparticular company, it was regarded as having a high impact on the business, as it\nwould be \u201clikely to lead to the customer line being stopped\u201d.\n[Take in Table V]\nThe participants were asked if inventory was regarded as reducing, or increasing, risk\nin international supply chains. It was generally viewed as acting in both ways, with a\nneed to find a compromise between opposing influences. For example, one\nrespondent noted that inventory acts as \u201crisk avoidance from the fluctuations in\ndemand, as well as between planning \/ production and customer lead times. There is a\npoint where increased inventory leads to increased customer service failures. Too\nlittle and orders can exceed stock, too much and managing the volumes and stock\nlocations leads to service failures\u201d.\nAnother participant noted the increased risks associated with inventory in\ninternational supply chains, as well as the reduced possibilities for risk mitigation\nstrategies, commenting: \u201cUndoubtedly, stock in an overseas supply chain involves\nmore risk than if the same product is bought from a home supplier. It is not easy to\nreact to changes in demand. If we bought the same product from a home supplier, we\nwould expect them to be holding stocks, thus reducing our risks\u201d.\n22\nA third participant considered that inventory was a risk avoidance mechanism, but\nwith the strong proviso that this is only the case when \u201cyou know that you are in touch\nwith the market\u201d. As soon as that proviso does not hold, then inventory was regarded\nas being a source of risk (e.g. by inhibiting response to market changes).\nIn addition, there were a number of comments that reflect the specific nature of\nindividual supply chains. For example, in one supply chain lead times were reduced\nby despatching goods whilst quality control tests were still being run. This led to\nincreased responsiveness - unless any tests proved negative, in which case there was\nthen a high risk of customer service failures. In another instance, the Customs duty\nand tax implications of holding inventory in different countries had a direct impact on\nthe nature of the supply chain, with implications for associated inventory levels and\nrisks.\nIn any specific supply chain, there are thus likely to be a wide range of factors to take\ninto account. In the case of international supply chains, lead times tend to be long and\nthe need to hold inventory appears to be common, if not the norm. The question faced\nby the companies participating in this research is thus how to balance these different\nfactors and determine the correct role and level of inventories, and, consequently, the\nappropriate role for warehouses at different stages in the supply chains.\nConclusions\nThe results indicate the importance of buffer inventory in international supply chains\nand suggest that it is very difficult to eliminate the need for such inventory\n23\ncompletely. The lead-time gap tends to be very wide indeed. The question is thus not\nwhether inventory is \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019, but how to determine the correct level.\nHowever, the complexity and wide range of issues involved is unlikely to render an\noptimisation approach per se as being feasible. This has been the traditional\ninventory control route in the past. On the other hand, there has been much written\nrecently about the disadvantages of holding inventory (such as slow reaction to the\nmarket and slow quality feedback), and thus the need to reduce or eliminate inventory.\nWhilst very useful concepts have been put forward to achieve these ends, there has\nbeen little research into the recognition of the need for inventory in many situations\nand how companies should identify the \u2018world-class best-practice\u2019 levels of inventory.\nA wider framework is therefore required to integrate these concepts with inventory\ncontrol theory.\nBased on this research and on the literature, it appears that the first question is\nwhether inventory is required at all. Some business models are suited to identifying\nconsumer trends and rapidly pushing product directly to the market without holding\nany inventory. These may be particularly applicable in fashion and high technology\nmarkets, where product life tends to be short. This is thus the first step in the\nproposed framework shown in Figure 3. This differentiation may be regarded as a\nfurther refinement of the taxonomy for selecting global supply chain strategies set out\nby Christopher et al., (2006), who differentiated between \u201cstandard\u201d and \u201cspecial\u201d\nproducts, with the latter tending to require agile supply chains. Fashion goods may be\nregarded as \u201cspecial\u201d products in this taxonomy, with the initial \u2018push\u2019 of product just\nrequiring sortation at distribution centres, but the follow-up replenishment items\ngiving rise to inventory holding. In addition, any special requirements of the supply\n24\nchain (e.g. holding goods in quarantine awaiting quality control testing) need to be\nidentified during this initial step.\n[Take in Figure 3]\nThe second step shown is to examine the inventory reduction strategies that may be\nappropriate. These may include for example the use of flexible manufacturing\nsystems, production postponement, and the centralisation of inventory. A further\nexample may be the use of final demand information throughout the supply chain (e.g.\nEPOS data) so that a single decoupling point can be established, rather than separate\nsafety stocks held by the vendor and the buyer, and so that the \u2018bull-whip\u2019 effect may\nbe minimised.\nIn parallel to this step, the risks associated with different supply chain strategies need\nto be examined, for example, the likelihood of disruption to supplies, or the possibility\nof inventory being rendered obsolete by new technology. This step should build on\ntools and techniques developed within supply chain risk literature (e.g. the supply\nnetwork risk tool outlined by Harland et al., 2003), taking into account qualitative as\nwell as quantitative considerations (e.g. supply chain confidence, described by\nChristopher and Lee, 2004). Such qualitative factors may include the role of trust,\nsocial relationships and different cultures, which have not been examined within this\nparticular research.\nOnce these strategies have been established, then it would be possible to identify the\ntrade-offs between inventory and other supply chain elements, such a purchasing (e.g.\n25\nbulk discounts on goods at lower unit purchase prices), manufacturing (e.g. lower\nproduction costs through less frequent change-overs and hence larger batch sizes) and\ntransport (e.g. full container load transport at lower unit transport costs). In this step,\nit is important to identify the full costs of inventory, as highlighted by Christopher\n(2005), so that these trade-offs are calculated correctly. Obviously, these decisions\nneed to take account of the supply chain risks already identified.\nHaving explored these options and trade-offs, the appropriate level of inventory can\nbe calculated utilizing established inventory control theory, in order to provide the\ndesired service level to customers. Based on this, the need for, and role of,\nwarehouses in the supply chain can then be identified. As noted in the case studies\nand the literature, these roles may include a mix of elements such as inventory\nholding, order consolidation, cross-docking, and postponement activities.\nInventory and warehousing strategies thus require co-ordination between various\naspects of a business, including for example the logistics, marketing and\nmanufacturing departments, as well as between supply chain partners. They are thus\nintegral and important parts of overall supply chain strategies and need to be planned\nas such. The exploratory framework outlined provides a way of bringing the different\nelements that need to be considered together.\nFurther research is required to understand these elements more fully and to develop\nthis framework as a useful tool for practitioners. It is proposed that this research\nshould first of all concentrate on a particular industry sector so as to gain a rich\nunderstanding of the interrelationships involved, possibly commencing with the\n26\nFMCG or the retail sector so as to build on the exploratory research presented in this\npaper. In addition, the research should be extended further back up the supply chain\nto examine the supply networks prior to manufacturing. The number of supply chains\nexplored should be extended until no new research findings of any significance are\nbeing found. These established findings can then be used as the basis for a more\ndetailed framework that would be of benefit to practitioners in that sector. Additional\nsectors can then be looked at, based for example on Christopher et al.\u2019s (2006)\ntaxonomy of supply chain strategies, to explore to what extent the developed\nframework is generally applicable and how it would need to be changed to reflect\ndifferent supply chain situations.\n27\nReferences\nAckerman, K.B. and Brewer, A.M.
