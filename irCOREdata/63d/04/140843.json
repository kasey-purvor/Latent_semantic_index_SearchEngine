[doi:10.1063\/1.3647577]\nNonvolatile ferroelectric random access memories make\nuse of two switchable remnant polarization states of the\nmaterials to store binary information, which have advantages\nof low writing voltage, fast writing speed, and high endur-\nance.1,2 Beyond the destructive readout of the information\nfrom capacitive ferroelectric memories,3 the nondestructive\nreadout is possible from high- and low-conductance bipolar\nswitching of ferroelectric resistive memories upon polariza-\ntion reversal.4\u20136 However, the present commercial ferroelec-\ntric testers measure polarization-voltage (P-V) hysteresis\nloops with a modified Sawyer-Tower circuit by applying a\ntriangular\/sinusoidal wave below 1MHz to an insulating thin\nfilm, which is different from memory writing\/reading pulses\nwith duration below 50 ns.3 Additionally, this technique is\nunable to differentiate the leakage current from the displace-\nment current and, thus, unsuitable for the leaky film charac-\nterization. From pulse measurements, it is possible to\nseparate the two currents and interweave the whole P-V loop\nfrom integrations of switching currents under many pulses in\nstep-by-step increase of the voltage,4 which is nevertheless\nunsuitable for the fast reliability tests. Due to this considera-\ntion, it is necessary to transfer a positive\/negative switching\ncurrent into a P-V hysteresis loop directly from which both\nthe remanent polarization (Pr) and coercive voltage (Vc) can\nbe predicted.\nInsulating Pb(Zr0.4Ti0.6)O3 (PZT) thin films were pre-\npared using sol-gel spin coating on IrO2\/Pt\/TiO2\/SiO2\/Si sub-\nstrates with the thickness of 140 nm. Pt\/IrO2 top electrodes\nwere sputtered on the films integrated into squares with side\nlengths of 1-200lm. For the extraction of P-V hysteresis\nloops in leaky films, oxygen-deficient (001) BiFeO3 (BFO)\nsemiconducting films with the thickness of 270 nm were de-\nposited on (100) SrTiO3 substrates at 650\n\u0002C with the SrRuO3\nbottom electrode using pulsed laser deposition at the O2 pres-\nsure of 10 Pa.4 Function-step voltage pulses with rising times\nof 5-7.5 ns were supplied by Agilent 33250A\/81150A pulse\ngenerators. Domain switching current Isw with time t under\nthe pulse was monitored by an LC 6200A oscilloscope in se-\nries with a ferroelectric capacitor Cf. The total internal resist-\nance of the pulse generator and oscilloscope is Rt\u00bc 100 X.\nThere is a reference capacitor Cref (\u0003 Cf) input in the\nSawyer-Tower circuit in the characterization of P-V loops\nunder a triangular\/sinusoidal wave. However, the characteri-\nzation can be much faster if Cref is replaced by Rt, as shown\nin the upper panel of Fig. 1. The voltage VR across Rt is\nguarded by an oscilloscope with Isw(t)\u00bcVR(t)\/Rt. Figure 1(a)\nshows VR(t) for PZT with the electrode area of S\u00bc 4\u0004 10\u00056\ncm2 under bipolar pulses of V(t) with the width of 30 ns,\nwhere we observed two peaks of positive and negative do-\nmain switching.7 From the voltage of Vf(t)\u00bcV(t)\u0005VR(t)\nacross Cf and the polarization compensation charge of\nFIG. 1.

In contrast, Vc is no longer constant,\nwhich otherwise enhances with the area reduction. This is\ndue to the fastened domain switching speed; the higher the\ndomain switching speed, the larger the coercive voltage.9\nThe speed is believed to be proportional to the domain\nswitching current density of Jsw\u00bc (V \u0005 Vc)\/(RtS), which is\nlargely adjustable through S spanning several orders of mag-\nnitude here.\nThe P-V hysteresis loop shifts positively\/negatively with\ntime along the voltage axis after a negative\/positive preset-\nting pulse (imprint).10,11 The imprint is induced through the\ninterfacial-layer charge injection between the film and the\nelectrodes to build up an internal field, which is temporally\nuncompensated after polarization reversal and described by a\nsemilogarithmic time dependence above an initial time t0 on\nthe order of several tens of seconds.10 Below t0, the Vc shift\nis believed to be weak. However, with our improved meas-\nurements, we can largely shorten the imprint time into 35 ns,\nas shown in Fig. 3(a), where the semilogarithmic time de-\npendence for the positive\/negative coercive voltage (6Vc)\npertains true without the above t0 limit, as shown by the\nsolid-line fitting of the data. Meanwhile, we can measure the\nnanosecond-range ferroelectric depolarization, much faster\nthan the time of seconds examined from the previous piezor-\nesponse force microscopy,12 as shown in Fig. 3(b). j\u0005Prj\ndecays exponentially with time, as shown by the solid-line\nfitting of the data, seemly like the interfacial-layer capacitor\ndischarging until the depolarization field across the ferro-\nelectric layer is smaller than the coercive field.8\nIf ferroelectric thin films are leaky for the resistive\nmemories, Isw(t) will show a leakage current level of IL= 0\nafter completion of domain switching in Fig. 4(a) (in solid\nlines). From a least-squares cubic polynomial fit of the\nVf \u0005 IL dependence and the relationship of Vf(t)\u00bcV (t)\n\u2013 IL(t)Rt, we can calculate IL(V(t)).\n4 After subtraction of\nIL(Vf(t)) from Isw(t), we obtained the domain displacement\ncurrent only in Fig. 4(a) (in dashed lines), and thus the final\nPf \u0005 Vf loop with Pr\u00bc 61-64 lC\/cm2 in Fig. 4(b), in agree-\nment with (001) oriented BFO insulators.13\nThe square loops in Fig. 4(b) are unavailable from the\ncommercial tester (Radiant Premier II) using a modified\nSawyer-Tower circuit, as shown by the opened symbols, and\nalso different from the loop interweaved with switching cur-\nrent integrations under many pulses.4 Unlike ferroelectric\ninsulators, the coercive field here is around 320 kV\/cm at\nVf\u00bc 12V in Fig. 4(b), which nevertheless reduces quickly\nwith the Vf reduction. This suggests the domain switching\nmechanism in a semiconductor different from those in other\nFIG. 2.

The apparent coercive voltage in the loop consists of\nthe intrinsic coercive voltage of domain switching and the\nvoltage of IswRc across Rc, where Isw\u00bc (V\u0005Vc)\/(Rc\u00feRt).4,8\nFrom the linear dependence of domain switching current on\nV shown by the inset in Fig. 4(a), we got the intrinsic\n6Vc\u00bc\u00fe5.17V\/\u00056.74V with asymmetric Rc\u00bc 121 X\/183 X\nin BFO,15 in agreement with the coercive field of \u0006200 kV\/\ncm in other insulators.13\nIn conclusion, we estimated Pr and Vc after domain\nswitching current transformation into a P-V hysteresis loop\nwith pulse width as short as 30 ns. After deduction of the\nleaky current from the switching current, we extracted the P-\nV hysteresis loop in a leaky BFO thin film with domain\nswitching mechanism different from other insulators. This\ntechnique is unique and superior to traditional Sawyer-\nTower measurements for the nanosecond characterization of\nimprint and retention in either insulating or leaky thin films.\nThis work was supported by the Shanghai Key Program\n(1052nm07600) and the Program for Professor of Special\nAppointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai.\n1J.
