In the first, before conditioning, the condi-\ntioned stimulus (CS) is neutral with respect to the behavior to be\nconditioned. Here associative conditioning requires the recruit-\nment of new processing pathways to link the CS to the condi-\ntioned behavioral response [e.g., rabbit eyeblink conditioning\n(Thompson, 2005)]. In the second category, the CS is not neutral\nbut evokes a response before conditioning that is related to the\nconditioned behavior. In this case, associative conditioning can\nderive froma strengthening orweakening of existing neural path-\nways [e.g., conditioning of Aplysia gill withdrawal reflex (An-\ntonov et al., 2001)]. The existence of these two categories suggests\nthat functionally novel processing pathways are only recruited\nwhen, before conditioning, the CS does not evoke a response\nrelated to the conditioned behavior. In contrast, in systems in\nwhich there is an existing response to the CS that is altered in its\namplitude by conditioning, it appears more likely that this is\nattributable to changes in existing neural pathways.\nChemical appetitive conditioning in the pond snail Lymnaea\nstagnalis is an established model system for the study of the cel-\nlular mechanisms that underlie associative memory formation\n(Kemenes et al., 2002; Ribeiro et al., 2003; Fulton et al., 2005). In\nconditioning of feeding behavior, amyl acetate (the CS) is paired\nwith sucrose, [the unconditioned stimulus (US)], resulting in the\nformation of an associative long-termmemory (Alexander et al.,\n1984). Although the CS has been reported to be neutral with\nrespect to feeding (Alexander et al., 1982; Audesirk et al., 1982),\nwe show here that, before conditioning, amyl acetate can both\nexcite and inhibit feeding behavior depending on its concentra-\ntion. Our knowledge of the Lymnaea feeding system (Benjamin\nand Elliott, 1989; Benjamin et al., 2000; Kemenes et al., 2001;\nStraub et al., 2002) allowed us to identify the neural pathways\nserving the excitatory and inhibitory effects on feeding in naive\nanimals. Their effects on feeding, however, are unaltered by as-\nsociative conditioning. Contrary to expectations, our experi-\nments also show that a new feeding stimulatory pathway that was\npreviously too weak for detection is significantly enhanced by\nconditioning, leading to its functional recruitment to the CS re-\nsponse.We show that the behavioral expression of the associative\nmemory derives from the parallel activation of the enhanced CS\nprocessing pathway and the existing inhibitory and excitatory CS\npathways. The integration of all three pathways accounts for the\nconditioned feeding response.\nMaterials andMethods\nAnimals. All experiments described here were performed using adult\n(4\u20135 month old) pond snails, L. stagnalis. The animals were bred and\nraised in the Lymnaea breeding facilities at the University of Sussex,\nwhere they were kept in copper-free (Cu-free) water at a temperature of\n20\u00b0C in a 12 h light\/dark cycle and were fed a diet of lettuce and fish food.\nTesting of CS effects on feeding behavior in naive animals. Snails were\nstarved for 4 d before testing. For testing, individual naive animals were\nplaced in 15 cm Petri dishes filled with 90 ml of Cu-free water.

During training, the conditioned group received a paired pre-\nsentation of the CS amyl acetate and the US sucrose, whereas the control\ngroup received a single presentation of the CS amyl acetate followed by a\nsingle presentation of the US sucrose 1 h later. The behavioral training\nand testing procedure is summarized in Figure 1, Ai and Aii.\nFor training, individual snails were positioned in the center of a 15 cm\nPetri dish filled with clean Cu-free water (90 ml) and left for 10 min. At\nthis point, the CS (5 ml of 0.08% amyl acetate; final concentration in the\ndish, 0.004%) was added to dishes containing animals in the control\ngroup, and a neutral water stimulus (5 ml) was added to dishes contain-\ning animals in the conditioned group. After 20 s, a second neutral water\nstimulus (5 ml) was added to all dishes, so that the dishes contained 100\nml of solution. The animals were removed from these dishes 2 min after\nthe addition of the first stimulus and returned to a tank containing clean\nwater.\nAfter 50 min, individual animals were again put in clean Petri dishes\nfilled with water (90ml) and left for 10min. At this point, a neutral water\nstimulus (5 ml) was added to dishes containing animals in the control\ngroup, and the CS (5 ml of 0.08% amyl acetate) was added to dishes with\nanimals from the conditioned group. After 20 s, the US (5 ml of 0.4 M\nsucrose; final concentration in dish, 0.02 M) was added to all dishes.\nAgain, the animals were removed from the dishes 2min after the addition\nof the first stimulus, that is, the neutral water stimulus or CS, and trans-\nferred to a tank containing clean water to rinse off any chemical stimuli.\nAfter 10 min, the animals were transferred to another tank containing\nclean water, in which they remained until testing. This training protocol\nensured that both groups received the same amount of handling and the\nsame amount of exposure to both the CS andUS.We also tested whether\nCS application alters the effect of the US on feeding behavior during the\ntraining phase by counting the number of rasps during US application in\na control and conditioned group. The feeding stimulatory effect of theUS\nwas unaltered by the presence of the CS in the conditioned group com-\npared with the control group that received the US alone (control group,\n30\u0001 2.4 rasps\/2min, n\u0002 18; conditioned group, 31.4\u0001 1.5 rasps\/2min,\nn\u0002 19; t test, p\u0002 0.62). Thus, the only difference between the two groups\nis that the conditioned group received a paired presentation of the US\nand CS, whereas the control group received an explicitly unpaired pre-\nsentation of the two stimuli.\nThe effect of the appetitive conditioning was tested \u201cblind\u201d 24 h after\ntraining (Fig. 1Aii). For testing, individual animals were placed for 10\nmin in 15 cm Petri dishes filled with Cu-free water (90 ml). Each animal\nwas then presented with a neutral water stimulus (5 ml of water added to\nthe dish), and the number of rasps was counted for a period of 2 min.\nAfter the 2 min observation period, the CS (5 ml of amyl acetate; con-\ncentration, 0.04, 0.08, and 0.4%)was added to the dish (final amyl acetate\nconcentrations in the dish, 0.002, 0.004, and 0.02%), and the number of\nrasps was counted for another 2 min period. Afterward, animals were\nrinsed and returned to clean tanks.\nMonitoring effects of chemosensory stimulation on fictive feeding activity\nin semi-intact preparations. Semi-intact preparations were prepared from\nnaive, control, and conditioned animals as indicated in Results. CS and\nUS responses in these preparations were recorded 1\u20134 d after behavioral\ntraining, and all experiments were performed blind (i.e., the experi-\nmenter was not aware of the training history of the preparation). All\ndissections and recordings were performed in standard Lymnaea saline\n(Straub et al., 2002).\nTwo types of semi-intact preparations, whole and reduced CNS, were\nused for the experiments described in this paper. The whole CNS prep-\naration consisted of the head of the animal containing themouth region,\nlips, and tentacles, the entire circumesophageal ganglionic ring, the buc-\ncal ganglia, and a long stretch of esophagus (see Fig. 2Bi). In this prepa-\nration, the median and superior lip nerves and the tentacle nerves are\nintact, forming the connection from the head structure to the cerebral\nganglia, whereas the cerebral\u2013buccal connectives link the cerebral gan-\nglia to the buccal ganglia. The stretch of esophagus is connected directly\nto the buccal ganglia via the dorsal buccal nerves. The reduced CNS\npreparation was identical to the whole CNS preparation, with the only\ndifference that the cerebral\u2013pedal and cerebral\u2013pleural connectives were\ncut to sever all connections between the cerebral ganglia and the remain-\ning circumesophageal ganglia (see Fig. 3Ai).\nIn both types of preparations, the distal end of the esophagus was\nstretched over a short length of plastic tubing to enable selective super-\nfusion of the internal esophageal surface. The plastic tubing was con-\nnected to a manifold, enabling the rapid switching between solutions\nusing a computer-controlled, custom-built superfusion system. A sec-\nond superfusion pipette was placed directly in front of the mouth region\nFigure 1. Chemical appetitive conditioning procedure and fictive feeding activity.

Both sites were constantly super-\nfused with standard Lymnaea saline at a rate of 1.5\u20132ml\/min throughout\nthe experiments. For stimulus application, the superfusion was rapidly\nswitched to either of the following stimulus solutions: 0.02 M sucrose\n(US) or 0.002, 0.004, and 0.02% amyl acetate (all made up in standard\nLymnaea saline). Control experiments confirmed that selective superfu-\nsion of either of the two sites evoked no significant response on the other\nsite. Furthermore, cutting of sensory nerves between the lips and cerebral\nganglia and the esophagus and buccal ganglia abolished all effects of US\nor CS application on fictive feeding activity, indicating that US and CS\neffects on neuronal activity are mediated via stimulation of the chemo-\nsensory structures.\nNeuronal activity in these preparations was recorded using sharp in-\ntracellular microelectrodes filled with KAc (3 M; electrode resistance,\n30\u201340 M\u0003). Electrical signals were amplified using Neurolog NL102\n(Digitimer, Hertfordshire, UK) andAxoClamp 2B amplifiers (Molecular\nDevices, Palo Alto, CA), digitized using a CED 1401 interface (Cam-\nbridge Electronics Design, Cambridge, UK), and displayed and stored on\na personal computer running Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronics\nDesign).\nFictive feeding activity in these preparationswasmonitored by record-\ning neuronal activity in the buccal feeding motoneurons B1, B3, and B4.\nThese three types of buccal neurons are visually identifiable in the intact\nganglia and receive distinct patterns of synaptic inputs during fictive\nfeeding activity (Fig. 1B). B1 neurons receive an excitatory synaptic input\nthat causes a depolarization of the membrane potential during the pro-\ntraction phase. In contrast, B3 and B4 neurons receive inhibitory synap-\ntic inputs during the protraction phase (Benjamin and Elliott, 1989). The\nrasp phase is characterized by a strong excitation of B3 neurons and a\nsimultaneous strong inhibition of B4 neurons. Finally, the swallow phase\nis indicated by a second phase of depolarization of the B3 neuron and the\ndepolarization of the B4 neurons that triggers a burst of action potentials\nafter the strong rasp phase inhibition. Thus, simultaneously monitoring\nactivity in these motoneuron types enables the unambiguous identifica-\ntion of fictive feeding cycles in semi-intact preparations. The number of\nfeeding cycles that fulfilled these criteria was counted for a 2 min period\nimmediately before stimulus application and compared with feeding ac-\ntivity during a 2 min period of stimulus application.\nPrevious experiments had shown that simultaneous US application to\nthe lips and the esophagus is a very reliable feeding stimulus in semi-\nintact preparations. Therefore, we only included preparations in the\nanalysis that showed an increase in fictive feeding activity in response to\nthis formof stimulation to eliminate preparations inwhich sensory path-\nways were damaged during the dissection procedure. Based on this cri-\nterion, 14% of preparations (27 of 199) were excluded from the analysis.\nAll analysis of the recordings from semi-intact preparations was per-\nformed blind.\nStandard statistical analyses (t test, ANOVA, etc.) as indicated in Re-\nsults were performed using the SPSS software package (SPSS, Chicago,\nIL).\nResults\nIdentification of CS pathways in naive snails\nAmyl acetate has been described previously as a neutral feeding\nstimulus (Alexander et al., 1982; Audesirk et al., 1982). However,\nby applying different concentrations of the CS, we identified ex-\ncitatory and inhibitory feeding responses in naive snails. Snails\nusually perform spontaneous feedingmovements so it is possible\ntomeasure both increases and decreases in feeding rates from this\n\u201cbaseline\u201d value. At the concentration of amyl acetate used pre-\nviously for conditioning (0.004%), there is no effect on feeding\n(\u201cneutral stimulus\u201d) (Fig. 2A). However, applying the CS at half\nthat concentration (0.002% amyl acetate) significantly stimulates\nfeeding (paired t test, p \u0004 0.05; n \u0002 24), whereas increasing the\nconcentration fivefold to 0.02% amyl acetate inhibits spontane-\nous feeding (paired t test, p\u0004 0.05; n\u0002 24).\nThese behavioral experiments suggested that there are both\nexcitatory and inhibitory chemosensory pathways in the Lym-\nnaea feeding system that are activated at different CS concentra-\ntions. We identified these pathways by making semi-intact prep-\narations that allow application of the CS to different sensory\nsurfaces and simultaneous electrophysiological recording of the\nfeeding motor program in the buccal ganglia. In Lymnaea, che-\nmosensory information from external (lips) and internal (esoph-\nagus) sensory structures is processed by anatomically distinct\npathways (Fig. 2Bi) (see also Fig. 5A). External chemosensory\ninformation is integrated in the cerebral ganglia before it is trans-\nferred to the feeding central pattern generator in the buccal gan-\nglia (Straub et al., 2004). In contrast, internal chemosensory in-\nformation enters the buccal ganglia directly, inwhich it affects the\nfeeding pattern generator. The existence of this direct chemosen-\nsory pathway was confirmed in preliminary experiments, which\ndemonstrated that US application to the esophagus induces feed-\ning activity inminimal preparations consisting only of the esoph-\nagus and buccal ganglia (Straub et al., 2003).\nIn the semi-intact preparation, we were able to superfuse se-\nlectively chemosensory epithelia located on the lips and the inter-\nnal surface of the esophagus (Fig. 2Bi). The effect of stimulating\nthese structures was measured as changes in fictive feeding activ-\nity in response to the stimulus. Fictive feeding activity was mon-\nitored by recording neuronal activity in feeding motoneurons\nthat have been shown to receive characteristic synaptic inputs\nduring feeding cycles in the intact animal (Rose and Benjamin,\n1979; Benjamin and Elliott, 1989).\nThe fictive feeding rate during CS application to the lips was\nsignificantly reduced at the highest concentration (0.02%; paired\nt test, p\u0004 0.05; n\u0002 12) (Fig. 2Bii,Ci). Additional tests with lower\nCS concentrations (0.004 and 0.002%) applied to the lips had no\nsignificant effect on fictive feeding activity (paired t tests, p \u0005\n0.05; n\u0002 12) (Fig. 2Bii). In contrast, CS application to the esoph-\nagus stimulated fictive feeding activity even at the lowest concen-\ntration tested (0.002%; paired t tests, p \u0004 0.05; n \u0002 7) (Fig.\n2Biii,Cii). Similar feeding stimulatory effects were observed in\nresponse to the application of higher CS concentrations (0.004\nand 0.02%) to the esophagus (paired t tests, p\u0004 0.01; n\u0002 7) (Fig.\n2Biii). These results confirm the existence of separateCS process-\ning pathways with distinct activation thresholds in naive snails\nthat have inhibitory (lips) and stimulatory (esophagus) effects on\nfictive feeding responses. Given that spontaneous feeding ensures\nthat both sensory structures are stimulated by the CS in the intact\nsnail, it is reasonable to conclude that the esophagus will mediate\nthe increase in behavioral feeding at the lowest CS concentration\nand lip stimulation the inhibition of feeding seen at the highest\nconcentration (Fig. 2A).\nIt was important to characterize the CNS pathway responsible\nfor the inhibitory component of the lip CS response in more\ndetail to assess its role in learning. During the tests for the effects\nof high CS concentrations on feeding behavior, it was noticed\nthat the inhibition of feeding activity was accompanied by aver-\nsive responses such as withdrawal. Defensive and feeding behav-\niors are mutually exclusive in Lymnaea (Kemenes et al., 1986;\nKyriakides andMcCrohan, 1988;Winlow et al., 1992), suggesting\nthat the suppression of feeding activity by highCS concentrations\nis the indirect result of the activation of withdrawal circuits in the\nCNS. Because neurons of the withdrawal response are located in\nthe nonfeeding ganglia of the CNS (Ferguson and Benjamin,\n1991; Inoue et al., 1996), we supposed that the feeding suppres-\nsive effects were the result of negative feedback that originate\nfrom the withdrawal circuitry located outside the cerebral and\nStraub et al. \u2022 Associative Learning Activates Novel CS Pathway J.

To test this hypothesis, we removed all of the CNS\napart from the cerebral and buccal ganglia from the semi-intact\npreparation (Fig. 3Ai, reduced CNS preparation). This left the\nlip\u2013cerebral\u2013buccal ganglia pathway and the more direct esoph-\nageal\u2013buccal ganglia pathway intact (see Fig. 5A) and available\nfor CS stimulation.\nUnlike the semi-intact preparation with the intact CNS\n(whole CNS preparation), CS application to the lips in the re-\nduced CNS preparation produced no significant inhibition of\nfictive feeding activity (paired t test, p\u0005 0.05; n\u0002 34) (Fig. 3Aii).\nThis neutral response in the reducedCNS preparationwas signif-\nicantly different from the feeding suppressive effect of the same\nstimulus observed in thewhole CNS preparation (t test, p\u0004 0.05)\n(Fig. 2Bii). Additional tests using the CS at lower concentrations\n(0.002 and 0.004%) also produced no significant changes in fic-\ntive feeding rates [\u0006 fictive feeding, 0.002%, 0.6 \u0001 0.7 cycles\/2\nmin (n\u0002 10), paired t test, p\u0005 0.05; 0.004%,\u00070.1\u0001 0.4 cycles\/2\nmin (n \u0002 10), paired t test, p \u0005 0.05]. Thus, this experiment\nprovides direct evidence that ganglion excision interrupts the CS\nprocessing pathway from the lips mediating the suppression of\nfeeding behavior.\nIn contrast, ganglion excision had no significant effect on the\nfeeding stimulatory effect of CS application to the esophagus\n(Fig. 3Aiii) when compared with the responses in the whole CNS\npreparation (t test, p \u0005 0.05) (Fig. 2Cii). Neither did ganglion\nremoval affect the ability of US application to the lips to produce\na feeding stimulatory effect in reduced CNS preparations (in-\ncrease in fictive feeding by 2.2\u0001 0.6 cycles\/2 min; n\u0002 13), which\nis similar to the US response in the whole CNS preparation (in-\ncrease in fictive feeding by 1.3\u0001 0.4 cycles\/2 min; n\u0002 36; t test,\np \u0005 0.05). These experiments clearly show that the inhibitory\nresponse to stimulation of the lips by the CS requires parts of the\nCNS located outside of the feeding ganglia (rest of CNS in Fig. 5).\nThe stimulatory effects of the US on the lips are not affected by\nganglion removal, showing that the normal feeding-activation\npathways are retained in the reduced CNS preparation.\n4\nFigure 2. Identification of two separate CS processing pathways in naive animals.

At\n0.004%, the CS is a behaviorally \u201cneutral\u201d stimulus that does not significantly alter the sponta-\nneous feeding activity. However, 0.002% CS results in a significant increase in feeding activity,\nand 0.02% CS significantly inhibits feeding activity.

This conditioned response\ncould be the result of alterations in either of the two CS process-\ning pathways that have been shown to significantly affect feeding\nbehavior in naive animals. Experiments investigating lip re-\nsponses in reduced semi-intact preparations, however, demon-\nstrated the strengthening of a lip stimulatory pathway that was\nactivated by the CS and contributed to the conditioned response.\nThe previous experiment (Fig. 3) on naive snails showed that\nreducing the preparation removes the lip inhibitory response to\nthe CS but left the direct pathway from the lips to the cerebral\nganglia intact and available for testing after learning. After behav-\nioral conditioning, reduced preparations showed a significant\nincrease in fictive feeding activity in response to 0.02% CS appli-\ncation to the lips (paired t test, p\u0004 0.001; n\u0002 20) (Fig. 4B).

Animals that received an explicitly\nunpaired presentation of the CS and US during conditioning (Control) showed a significant\nsuppression of feeding activity during the 0.02% CS application (CS) compared with the water\nscore (water). This feeding suppressive effect was reversed in conditioned animals, in which\n0.02% CS caused a significant increase in feeding activity (Conditioned). B, CS application\n(0.02%) to the lips causes a significant increase in fictive feeding activity in reduced CNS prep-\narations (see Fig. 2Ai) from conditioned animals but not from control animals.

Baseline, Fictive feeding activity during 2\nmin before CS application; CS, fictive feeding activity during 2 min of CS application. D, Condi-\ntioning does not change the inhibitory pathway that mediates feeding suppressive CS effect in\nnaive animals. The feeding suppressive effect of CS application to the lips is only present in the\nwhole CNS (whole control CNS) but not in the reduced CNS preparation (reduced control CNS).\nTherefore, the absolute difference between the CS effect in whole CNS and reduced CNS prep-\narations from control animals provides an estimate of the inhibitory component (\u0006i). If this\ninhibitory component is unchanged by conditioning, adding \u0006i to the observed CS effect in\nwhole CNSpreparations fromconditioned animals (predicted) should provide a goodprediction\nfor the CS effect in reduced CNSpreparations from conditioned animals (reduced cond CNS) that\nlack the inhibitory pathway (observed). This is in fact the case, because there is no significant\ndifference between the predicted and observed CS effect in reduced CNS preparations from\nconditioned animals (t test, p\u0004 0.05). This strongly suggests that conditioning does not alter\nthe inhibitory CS pathway. *p\u0004 0.05; **p\u0004 0.01; ***p\u0004 0.001. ns, Not significant.\nStraub et al. \u2022 Associative Learning Activates Novel CS Pathway J.

This provides\ndirect evidence that conditioning changes the response to CS\napplication to the lips, so that it can activate a previously ineffec-\ntive lip\u2013cerebral\u2013buccal pathway that nowmediates a significant\nfeeding stimulatory effect. It is also noteworthy that the size of the\nconditioned fictive feeding response after CS application to the\nlips (2.1\u0001 0.4 cycles\/2 min; n\u0002 20) is similar to the changes in\nfictive feeding rate induced by US application to the lips in the\nsame preparations from naive (2.2 \u0001 0.6 cycles\/2 min; n \u0002 13),\ncontrol (2.8\u0001 1.4; n\u0002 10), and conditioned (1.4\u0001 0.6 cycles\/2\nmin; n \u0002 14; ANOVA, F \u0002 0.5, p \u0005 0.5) animals. This suggests\nthat the modified CS pathway accesses the same final common\npathway for feeding activation (Fig. 5Bii) as the US pathways.\nThis CS feeding stimulatory pathway is also active in thewhole\nCNS preparation of conditioned animals, in which its action\ncounters the feeding inhibitory effect of the CS in unpaired con-\ntrol preparations, resulting in its reversal (\u0006 fictive feeding, con-\ntrol animals, \u00071.5 \u0001 0.7cycles\/2 min, n \u0002 17; conditioned ani-\nmals, 0.6\u0001 0.3 cycles\/2 min, n\u0002 15; t test, p\u0004 0.001) (Fig. 4C).\nAppetitive conditioning does not change the behavioral effect\nof the CS through existing pathways\nAdditional analysis of the data from these experiments on re-\nduced and whole brain preparations also provided evidence that\nthe strength of the inhibitory component of the lip CS pathway is\nnot changed by conditioning (Fig. 4D). The contribution of the\ninhibitory component (\u0006i) to the overall effect of the CS on feed-\ning activity was calculated as the absolute difference between the\nchange in fictive feeding rate produced by CS application to the\nlips in whole and reduced CNS preparations (Fig. 4D left; for\nadditional justification, see figure legend). On the assumption\nthat this inhibitory component is not changed by conditioning,\nadding the \u0006i value to the CS response in whole CNS prepara-\ntions from conditioned animals should predict the conditioned\nresponse in the reduced CNS preparation (Fig. 4D, right). A\ncomparison of the observed CS response in reduced CNS prepa-\nrations from conditioned animals with the predicted conditioned\nCS response shows no significant differences (t test, p \u0005 0.05),\nsupporting the hypothesis that conditioning is not affecting the\nexisting inhibitory CS pathway. An alternative analysis using a\ntwo-way ANOVA of the effects of CS application to the lips on\nfeeding activity in whole and reduced CNS preparations from\ncontrol and conditioned animals also reveals no significant inter-\naction effect between the type of preparation (factor 1, whole vs\nreduced CNS) and the type of animal (factor 2, control vs condi-\ntioned; F\u0002 0.27, p\u0005 0.05). If changes in the inhibitory CS path-\nway had contributed to the conditioned CS response, it would\nhave resulted in a significant interaction effect, because the inhib-\nitory CS pathway is only present in the whole CNS but not in the\nreduced CNS preparation.\nConditioning also did not change the feeding stimulatory re-\nsponse attributable to esophageal CS application. CS application\nto the esophagus alone in whole semi-intact preparations in-\ncreased fictive feeding activity in both control and conditioned\nanimals from 3.1 \u0001 0.6 cycles\/2 min (n \u0002 8) and 3.8 \u0001 0.6\ncycles\/2 min (n \u0002 7), respectively, to 5.7 \u0001 0.4 and 7.1 \u0001 0.9\ncycles\/2 min (paired t tests, p\u0004 0.05). There was no difference in\nthe effect on fictive feeding in the two groups (\u0006 fictive feeding,\ncontrol animals, 2.6 \u0001 0.6 cycles\/2 min vs conditioned animals,\n3.3\u0001 1.0 cycles\/2 min; t test, p\u0005 0.05).\nDiscussion\nOur results demonstrate the existence of two independent CS\nprocessing pathwayswith significant functional effects on feeding\nbehavior in naive animals. The existence of these two pathways\ncould suggest that appetitive conditioning is a form of alpha con-\nditioning (Dudai, 1989), in which the conditioned response re-\nsults from changes in existing CS processing pathways. Hypo-\nthetically, either a weakening of the feeding inhibitory CS effect\non external chemosensory structures (lip) or a strengthening of\nthe feeding stimulatory CS effect on internal (esophagus) chemo-\nsensory structures could account for the conditioned response.\nHowever, our studies revealed no significant changes in the ef-\nfects of either of these two pathways on feeding behavior. Instead,\nwe identified a third CS processing pathway that is modified in\nconditioned animals so that itmediates a significant feeding stim-\nulatory effect in response to external CS application. Hints of this\nthird pathway may have been present in reduced CNS prepara-\nFigure 5. Networkmodel for processing of chemosensory information in Lymnaea showing\nconditioning-induced changes. A, Schematic overview of neuronal pathways involved in the\nprocessing of chemosensory information and learning. Sensory information from chemorecep-\ntors located on the lips (external) and the esophagus (internal) are processed by anatomically\ndistinct neuronal pathways. US sucrose and CS amyl acetate (AA) information from the lips is\nintegrated in the cerebral ganglia. In contrast,USandCS information fromtheesophagusenters\nthe buccal ganglia directly, and both stimuli activate the feeding central pattern generator\n(CPG), increasing feeding behavior.

Bi, Details of chemo-\nsensory integration in cerebral ganglia of naive animals. USapplication leads to theactivationof\nCBIs that are command neurons for feeding behavior resulting in the stimulation of the feeding\ncentral pattern generator. In contrast, the CS application results in the activation of neuronal\nelements in the rest of the CNS that suppress feeding central pattern generator activity by\ninhibiting CBI activity that provides the drive for spontaneous feeding activity. Bii,\nConditioning-induced changes in the processing of CS information in the cerebral ganglia.\nClassical reward conditioning of Lymnaea feeding behavior leads to the formation of a new\nfunctional excitatory pathway between CS-sensitive chemoreceptors in the lips and CBIs, thus\nenablingCSapplication to activate CBIs and stimulate feedingactivity. Note that thepreexisting\nCS processing pathways in naive animals are unaltered by conditioning and contribute to the\nfinal behavioral effect of the CS in conditioned animals.\n4144 \u2022 J. Neurosci., April 12, 2006 \u2022 26(15):4139\u20134146 Straub et al. \u2022 Associative Learning Activates Novel CS Pathway\ntions from both naive and control animals, in which CS applica-\ntion to the lips slightly enhanced fictive feeding activity (Figs.\n3Aii, 4B). However, this potential unconditioned effect was at\nbest very weak. Even combining the data from naive and control\nreduced CNS preparations failed to reveal a statistically signifi-\ncant enhancement of fictive feeding by the CS (\u0006 fictive feeding,\n0.4\u0001 0.3 cycles\/2 min; paired t test, p\u0005 0.05; n\u0002 49). Although\nthis data does not exclude the possibility of a feeding stimulatory\nlip\u2013cerebral\u2013buccal CS pathway in naive animals, our data show\nthat this pathway is functionally inoperative in naive animals.\nThus, we conclude that the enhanced CS feeding response after\nconditioning is attributable to modifications in this lip stimula-\ntory pathway rather than changes in the lip inhibitory and esoph-\nageal excitatory pathways that provide the main contribution to\nCS responses in naive animals.\nAlthough this study has been conducted at the systems level,\nwe can propose aminimal networkmodel to account for associa-\ntive conditioning (Fig. 5). This model is built on our detailed\nknowledge of the feeding circuitry, which includes the cerebral\u2013\nbuccal interneurons (CBIs) (Kemenes et al., 2001; Straub et al.,\n2004). These are a group of command neurons located in the\ncerebral ganglia that project to the buccal ganglia, in which they\ncan activate the feeding central pattern generator (Fig. 5A). We\npropose that, in conditioned animals, these neurons are recruited\nto the feeding stimulatory pathway and enhance their responsive-\nness to the CS attributable to modifications in the synaptic con-\nnections between CS-sensitive pathways and the CBIs (Fig.\n5Bi,Bii). This model is consistent with data from our previous\nwork recording axonal CBI activity in the connective between the\ncerebral and buccal ganglia in control and conditioned animals\n(Straub et al., 2004). This work showed that the CBIs responded\nwith an increase in activity to lip application of the US and the CS\n(after conditioning) and identified the cerebral ganglia as a main\nsite of synaptic plasticity underlying chemical conditioning. Fur-\nthermore, intracellular recordings from an identified CBI, the\ncerebral ventral 1 neuron (CV1), have shown that these neurons\nonly respond to the CS after successful appetitive conditioning\nwith no synaptic response before conditioning (Whelan andMc-\nCrohan, 1996; Kemenes et al., 2002). Similarly, in the honey bee,\nactivity patterns of a multimodal integrating neuron, PE1, in\nresponse to a CS have been shown to bemodulated by condition-\ning (Mauelshagen, 1993). The similarity of the strength of the\nfictive feeding response to theCS after conditioning and to theUS\nin the present study also supports the hypothesis that theCBIs are\nthe common final pathway for the activation of feeding.\nThe enhanced recruitment of CBIs to the CS response could\nbe the result of changes in their intrinsic properties that increase\ntheir responsiveness to the CS. This has been shown to be an\nimportant contributor to tactile conditioning ofLymnaea feeding\nbehavior, in which conditioning results in a persistent depolar-\nization of the CV1membrane potential (Jones et al., 2003). How-\never, no such persistent depolarization of the CV1 membrane\npotential has been found after chemical conditioning in Lymnaea\n(Kemenes et al., 2000). Therefore, we conclude that the chemical\nconditioning-induced changes aremore likely to involve changes\nin the functional connectivity of the CS processing pathways.We\nsuggest that this could be the result of the formation of novel\nsynaptic connections between the CS pathways and the CBIs.\nAlternatively, existing synapses may be nonfunctional or too\nweak to mediate a strong effect on feeding activity in naive ani-\nmals before conditioning. Strengthening of weak synapses has\nbeen demonstrated to underlie various conditioning paradigms\n(Kandel and Schwartz, 1982; Glanzman, 1995; Hawkins et al.,\n1998; Antonov et al., 2003; Roberts and Glanzman, 2003; Wick-\nens et al., 2003; Crow, 2004), whereas the activation of silent\nsynapses has been suggested to contribute to long-term potenti-\nation (Montgomery et al., 2001; Voronin and Cherubini, 2004).\nRegardless of the underlying mechanism, our results suggest that\nconditioning leads to the creation of a functionally new pathway,\nprobably attributable to the enhanced recruitment of CBIs to the\nCS processing pathway, which enables the CS to activate feeding\nafter conditioning.\nThis model circuitry provides the mechanism for the integra-\ntion of modified and unmodified CS processing pathways and\naccounts for the conditioned response in the intact animal. In\nnaive snails, the stimulation of the lips by the high concentrations\nof the CS suppresses spontaneous feeding and consequently pre-\nvents the activation of the esophageal excitatory pathway, result-\ning in the overall reduction of feeding activity. At lower CS con-\ncentrations, however, lip stimulation does not suppress\nspontaneous feeding and the internalization of amyl acetate acti-\nvates the low-threshold excitatory esophageal pathway, leading to\nthe stimulation of feeding activity. In conditioned snails, en-\nhanced activation of the lip excitatory pathway also enables high\nCS concentrations to have feeding stimulatory effects because\nactivation of this pathway offsets the inhibitory effect of the CS\nvia the lips. It thereby allows the esophageal pathway to dominate\nand initiate conditioned feeding. Thus, the conditioned behavior\nrequires the parallel activation and integration of pathways that\nare both unmodified and modified by training.\nReferences\nAlexander Jr J, Audesirk TE, Audesirk GJ (1984) One-trial reward learning\nin the snail Lymnaea stagnalis.
