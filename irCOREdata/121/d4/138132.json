To date, the aerodynamic \nmechanisms used by insects have been inferred by eye from qualitative flow \nvisualisations. Smoke visualisations with tethered hawkmoths (Ellington et al. 1996) \nhave been interpreted as showing a conical leading-edge vortex spiralling spanwise \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.  High-lift insect aerodynamics \n 3\nfrom a point fixed on the proximal surface of the wings (a focus). Experiments with \nflapping mechanical models have shown qualitatively the same flow structures \n(Ellington et al. 1996; Maxworthy 1979; Van den Berg and Ellington 1997), with \nsignificant spanwise flow extending vorticity into the tip vortices to stabilise the flow \nstructure. More recent work (Birch and Dickinson 2001) indicates that spanwise flow \nis insignificant at the lower Reynolds numbers associated with smaller insects (Re \n\u223c100). Recent smoke visualisations with free-flying butterflies (Vanessa atalanta) \n(Srygley and Thomas 2002) reveal another class of leading-edge vortex, in which the \nstructure is continuous across the insect\u2019s centreline, with no surface bound focus (i.e. \nwith a free-slip critical point over the centreline). \n \nA major difficulty in interpreting smoke visualisations is that they record a summed \ntime history of a flow, rather than the instantaneous flow field. However, new insights \ninto the flow are possible if instantaneous data are recorded from the flow using a \ntechnique such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) (Adrian 1991). In the following \nDigital PIV (DPIV) is used to measure the flow around the wings and in the near \nwake of a Tobacco Hawkmoth (Manduca sexta L.).  \n \n2 \nMaterials and Methods \nSeveral individuals of the Tobacco Hawkmoth Manduca sexta L. were obtained from \na captive bred population, and selected for physical characteristics indicative of health \n(good wing condition, strong free-flight ability, etc.). Data presented here were \ncollected over 9 consecutive bouts of flight from an individual weighing 1.52g, with a \nwing length of 52mm and a thorax width of 8mm. From image analysis, the body \nangle was found to be elevated by 28\u00b0 from horizontal. The insect was flown for \nDPIV measurements in a low-speed, low-turbulence wind tunnel (1.0\u00d70.5\u00d70.5m \nworking section) at two flight speeds where the freestream was set at V\u221e = 1.2ms-1 and \n3.5ms-1. The insect was rigidly tethered (using cyanoacrylate adhesive applied to the \nunderside of the thorax) to a 6-component strain gauge force-moment balance (FFA I-\n666; 10kHz sampling rate) connected to a Macintosh computer (with MacLab \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.  High-lift insect aerodynamics \n 4\nhardware and Chart v.3.6\/s) and synchronised with the DPIV system. The balance \noutput was converted to force-moment units in all channels in Matlab using a static \ncalibration analysed as a third order general linear model (GLM) with all significant \nsecond order interactions (P=0.05; Taylor and Thomas, in prep.). \nA DPIV system was set-up to generate a fixed vertical light sheet that was projected \ninto the centre of the working section of the wind tunnel from the downstream tunnel \nexit (Fig. 1). The light sheet was generated from a New Wave Gemini Nd:YAG \npulsed laser (120mJ per 5ns pulse) and a combination of a plano-concave and plano-\ncylindrical lenses with focal lengths of -50mm and 75mm respectively. This resulted \nin a 0.4mm thick expanding light sheet that provided an imaging area up to 100mm \u00d7 \n100mm. The force balance could be traversed across the tunnel with the moth in situ \nwhich allowed  planes to be measured from the moth at either midspan or abdomen \n(sagittal plane) positions. Seeding was supplied from a JEM Hydrosonic Seeder \n(Lancelyn Theatre Supplies, Oxford, U.K) placed at the tunnel intake with \u2018long \nlasting\u2019 smoke fluid to produce seeding with a diameter <10\u03bcm. DPIV images were \nrecorded using a Micro-Nikor 105mm focal length lens and Kodak ES1.0 CCD  \nsynchronised to the laser through a Dantec Flowmap 500 acquisition box and \nFlowmanager software. Laser pulse separations of between 70-200\u03bcs were used \ndepending on the freestream velocity. Around 70 pairs of images were taken for each \nflight session. At each windspeed, two flights were recorded with the light sheet in the \nsagittal plane of the animal, and two flights with the light sheet in a para-sagittal plane \n(midspan on the wing nearest the camera). From these flights a representative sample \nof DPIV images was selected to compile a time-resolved history of the flow field. \nIdeally a full time-resolved set of vector maps would be desirable, but the 15Hz frame \nrate of the ES1.0 was insufficient to do this for the 19Hz moth wingbeat frequency. \n \nDPIV images were processed using TSI UltraPIV Insight software incorporating the \nHart Algorithm (Hart 2000). A primary correlation window of 32 \u00d7 32 pixels was \nselected with a sub-correlation window of 16 \u00d7 16 pixels and a search radius of 8 x 8 \npixels. A bilinear peak search was also selected. This typically yielded 121 \u00d7 121 \nvectors per DPIV image and corresponded to a spatial resolution of 0.75mm \u00d7 \n0.75mm over a 92mm \u00d7 92mm imaging area. Vector and vorticity fields were \ndisplayed using Tecplot v.8.0 and streamlines were also added using the pull-down \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.  High-lift insect aerodynamics \n 5\nmenu option. These \u2018streamlines\u2019 are based solely on the 2-dimensional slice of data \nthrough a 3-dimensional wake and are thus projections onto a plane rather than \nclassical streamlines.  The flow is also unsteady, and for both these reasons, it is \nunlikely that any particle would ever travel along these lines.  The streamlines \npresented here are, however, still able to define flow structures such as vortices. From \nerror analysis outlined previously (Lawson and Davidson 2001), it is estimated that \nthe error in the DPIV data is in the range 2.2% - 5.5% of full scale measurement. \n \n3 \nAnalysis \nBecause the primary aim of this study was to visualise the fluid motion in the \nimmediate vicinity of the wing, the camera\u2019s field of view was too small to visualise \nthe far wake except at the lower speed. At this speed (V\u221e = 1.2ms-1), we were able to \ninfer the aerodynamic forces on the wings by measuring the circulation of the trailing, \nor wingtip vortices convected in the wake using cross sections in the plane of the \nlaser. This inference is justified by Kelvin\u2019s theorem of equivalence in the absolute \nmagnitude of bound and shed circulation during the impulsive starting of an aerofoil \nor hydrofoil under inviscid conditions. Since the wings are held close together \ndorsally at the end of each complete wingbeat, and some insects have been shown at \nrelatively slow speeds such as these to produce structures approximating vortex rings, \nwe calculate locomotor forces from vortex loops (which need not be round) using \nthese assumptions as a starting point. The loop created by each wingbeat cycle is the \ncombination of wingtip kinematics and the effect of the freestream on the convecting \ntrailing vortices. Assuming that the conditions are inviscid, and that all the \nmomentum added to the fluid by the moth is contained within vortices in the wake, \nthe time averaged locomotor force F can be calculated as follows: \n \nF = \u03c1\u0393A\/T (1) \n \nwhere \u03c1 is the air density (1.225kg.m-3), \u0393 is the circulation (the line integral of the \ntangential velocity component about a curve enclosing the vortex core; (Batchelor \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.  High-lift insect aerodynamics \n 6\n1967)), again, each of these velocities is a projection of the total possible velocity \nvector onto the plane of interrogation defined by the laser.  A is the area enclosed by \nthe vortex loop, and T is the time over which the force is generated (i.e. one wingbeat \nperiod). \u0393 was calculated by the equation: \n \n\u0393 = \u03c0.d.\u03c9t (2) \n \nwhere d is the diameter of the vortex core and \u03c9t  is the mean tangential velocity at \nthe edge of the vortex core. The edge of the vortex core was defined as the point at \nwhich maximum and minimum velocities occurred on a velocity profile through the \ncore (measured as a mean of the peak velocities in horizontal and vertical cross-\nsections through the same vortex core on each image), and it was assumed that there \nwas no significant degradation of the vorticity during the small convection from wing \ntip to the point of measurement. The area of the loop was approximated and \ncalculated as for an ellipse with the major axis (core centre to core centre) measured \nfrom the calibrated DPIV images, and the minor axis taken as the length of two wings \nplus the thorax width. This approximation was used in all calculations, as the field of \nview was only big enough to contain a complete loop as soon as it had shed, owing to \nconvection of the earliest shed sections of the vortex with the freestream. This is \njustified in that the minor axis is defined by the individual\u2019s geometry, and the major \naxis is dependent on wing beat frequency and the freestream velocity, both of which \nremained constant throughout each of the separate experimental periods. The angle of \nthe loop to horizontal (x-axis of images) and the jet angle were measured using \nTecplot. \n  \n \n4 \nResults and Discussion \nAn insect wing stroke cycle consists of four phases.  Conventionally speaking it \nbegins with a rotational phase at the top of the upstroke and beginning of the \ndownstroke called \u2018pronation\u2019.  There follows a largely translational downstroke \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.  High-lift insect aerodynamics \n 7\nphase, followed by a second rotation called \u2018supination\u2019, and finally the translatory \nupstroke. The flow field induced by the moth towards the end of the downstroke at the \ncommencement of supination is shown in Fig. 2, with the V\u221e = 3.5ms-1 freestream \nvelocity subtracted. At this point in the wingbeat cycle, the camera looks directly \ndown the length of the near\/left wing, as it begins to rotate in preparation for the \nupstroke. The flow halfway out along the wings (Fig. 2a-c) is separated at the leading \nedge, forming a leading-edge vortex. Owing to the controversy over vortex \nidentification methods, it has become common practice to use a combination of two or \nmore criteria to reduce the likelihood of misidentification (Banks and Singer 1995). \nOne criterion is that of streamlines spiralling into a stable focus (Robinson 1991); \nanother is that of a vorticity maximum (Lugt 1985). On the downstroke of Manduca, \nthe streamlines converge in a stable focus above the wing. This coincides with a \nvorticity maximum, demonstrating the presence of a leading-edge vortex above the \nwing. The leading-edge vortex coincides with peak upward force production, and is \nequivalent to 2.2 times bodyweight (Fig. 3). Inertial forces due to acceleration and \ndeceleration of the wings and their associated added mass have not been removed \nfrom the force traces, but since the wings decelerate in preparation for stroke reversal, \nthese inertial forces would then be acting downwards, implying an aerodynamic \ncontribution even greater than 2.2 times bodyweight. \n \nThe leading-edge vortex was clearly observed at V\u221e =3.5ms-1, and was recorded \nduring a sequence in which the moth was supporting 79% of its bodyweight (averaged \nover 10 wingbeats).  There is similar flow separation at V\u221e =1.2ms-1. The frame of \nreference is crucial if straightforward subtraction of the freestream is to reveal a focus. \nOver the thorax, subtraction of the full freestream velocity at 10\u00b0 downwards \ndeflection revealed a focus, which coincided with the point of peak vorticity (Fig. 2d). \nFor Fig. 2d, some areas were blanked on account of glare from the thorax and \nabdomen.  No rotational transformation of the vector map was introduced but there is \nstill a correlation of converging streamlines and a vorticity maximum.  \n \nVelocity profiles of cross sections through the loops shed into the wake are similar to \nsections through ideal vortex rings and their cores (Fig. 3) derived from potential \ntheory, though there are minor differences. The top three pairs of graphs in Fig. 3 \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.  High-lift insect aerodynamics \n 8\nshow the close correlation between theoretical velocity profiles across vortex rings \n(a), cores (b) and axes (c), and those obtained through experimentation with \nManduca. (d) shows a similar pair of vertical and horizontal profiles through the \nleading-edge vortex. The width of a core is considered to be the portion of the graph \nwhich approximates to a straight line indicating solid body rotation - that portion of \nthe graph between the maximum and minimum values.  In the ideal case, measured \nvelocities in Fig. 3b and 3c both should decay to zero at the edges of the graphs but do \nnot, due to the overall downward convection of the vortex loop and core. The leading-\nedge vortex at midspan is approximately elliptical in cross-section with the major axis \ndirected chordwise. This can be seen from the shape of the streamlines and vorticity \nin Fig. 2, and also measured from the vertical and horizontal u and v component \nvelocity profiles (Fig. 3d). At the instant shown in Fig. 2, its core is 4mm\u00d76mm (Fig. \n3d, measured from those portions of the cross-sectional profiles which can be \napproximated to solid body rotation of the vortex core.). This is marginally smaller at \nthis midspan position than the freely convecting earliest shed tip vortex cores seen at \nV\u221e = 1.2ms-1, which were typically in the order of 8mm diameter (n =15 image pair \ncorrelations, standard deviation =2.2). Figure 3c shows an example of a vortex core \ncross-section. \nFigure 3e shows the vertical (positive upwards) and horizontal (positive forwards) \nforce measurements of the same wingbeat (i.e. the wingbeat from which the presented \nleading-edge vortex images were captured). \u2018Relative force\u2019 is force relative to body \nmass where a vertical (positive) value of 1 means the animal was exactly supporting \nits weight, including both aerodynamic lift, and inertial forces. The dashed line \nindicates the instant the laser fired coincides with the peak in force generation. The \ninsert shows the vertical force trace for the surrounding ten wingbeats. The main \ngraph corresponds to the yellow section of the insert, and is not exceptional. The wake \nbehind the wings consists of a curved trailing region of higher velocity flow \n(green\/blue Fig. 2c). These velocity values are a 2-dimensional projection of the real \n3-dimensional vectors using velocity components in the plane of interrogation. At the \nuneven lower boundary of this region is a vortex sheet shed from, and following the \npath of the trailing edge of the wing. This vortex sheet represents a difference in flow \nvelocity above and below the trailing edge. Once this difference in velocity reaches a \ncritical value, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability will cause the vortex sheet to roll up into a \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.  High-lift insect aerodynamics \n 9\nseries of discrete transverse vortices. Support for Kelvin-Helmholtz roll up can be \nseen in Fig. 2 (a and c) although the uneven lower boundary could be due to uneven \nwing flapping, which is impossible to determine without detailed kinematics.  \n \nIf we attempt to describe the dominant structures in the wake of Manduca in their \nsimplest form, they consist of a series of non-planar (i.e. curved) approximately \nelliptical vortex loops.  The earliest and latest portions of the loop are approximately \nlevel horizontally, but the plane of the loop defined by the vortex core is curved \ndownwards between these areas. The structures are certainly not classical \naxisymmetric vortex rings in that the jet angle is not in line with the axis, and the \nword \u2018ring\u2019 implies a circular shape. They are only approximately elliptical, however, \nbecause of the ill-defined shedding of the bound vortex after the end of the \ndownstroke. The loops are initially formed along the path traced by the wingtips, but \nthe earlier formed sections convect downwards as the wings progress through the \nstroke. Fig. 4 is a composite sequence highlighting the convection of the early \nsections of the vortex loop \u2013 with shed vorticity shown in green and yellow \u2013 from its \ncreation with wings held aloft and close together (Fig. 4a), to its location at the point \nafter the wings begin their upstroke (Fig. 4d).  \n \nWith the trailing edges of the wings still held close together dorsally, the leading \nedges begin to pull apart, creating counter-rotating vorticity (shown as blue and green \nareas) around the wings and in the near wake (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4b shows that part of the \nloop which was earliest to form (vorticity shown in green) convecting backwards and \ndownwards in the wake as the moth induced flow grows and becomes stronger. Roll-\nup of the early trailing  vortex (or wingtip vortex) is complete in Fig. 4c as the loop \ntakes shape and the yellow-green patch of vorticity is shed and becomes distict from \nthe wings. This first part of the loop to be formed by the wingtips convects \ndownwards and backwards until it is horizontally level with the vorticity still bound \nonto the wing (Fig. 4d). The final structure therefore incorporates both the trace of the \nwingtip motion and the history of convection of the earliest-shed sections of the wake. \nThe moth induced flow is now dominated by a downwards and backwards pointing \nflow, indicated by the largest red vectors. Horizontal cross-stream vorticity (normal to \nthe plane of the paper\/field of view) is shed in the form of a shear layer behind the \ntrailing edges.  Calculations based on the geometry of the gross loop structure used \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.  High-lift insect aerodynamics \n 10\nonly the major vortical structures visualised in the wake. Fig. 4 also shows some \nminor patches of vorticity which are shed into the wake, but not accounted for in these \ncalculations. \n \nA cartoon of the complete loop is shown in Fig. 5 highlighting the main wake \nelements with their associated rotations, the major deflection of the freestream, and \nalso the minor filaments (cross-stream red lines) which form in the curved plane of \nthe vortex sheet after the shear layer has deteriorated. The width of the ellipse can be \nassumed to be the tip-to-tip span of the moth; the length of the ellipse is a \ncombination of factors including wingbeat frequency and freestream velocity (1.8 \ntimes longer than it\u2019s width at V\u221e = 1.2ms-1). The final shape of the loop is a \nhorizontal, elliptical torus, curved downwards in the middle, with a jet running \napproximately down through the loop\u2019s main axis. The horizontal stopping vortex \nnormal to the freestream (the last section of the loop to be shed into the wake) is shed \nwell into the upstroke, and is more diffuse than other parts of the loop. This is perhaps \nas a result of the interference of subsequent upstroke wake (Spedding 1987), but it is \nunlikely to be as clearly defined as the earliest shed trailing wingtip vortex. This is \nbecause the wings do not approach each other closely ventrally as they do dorsally. \nVorticity is shed continuously from the trailing edges, and is predominantly \nanticlockwise (in the same reference frame as Fig. 2 and Fig. 4), indicating a \ncomplementary increase in the circulation around the wings during the downstroke, \nmost likely linked with the growth of any leading-edge vortex that may form. \n \nKelvin\u2019s theorem that the absolute magnitude of bound and shed vorticity is \nequivalent allows us to use the circulation of the wake vortices to infer the propulsive \nforces that arise from circulation around the wings. The DPIV data suggest that the \nforces produced by the vortex loops can account for 85% of the measured resultant \nforce averaged through the stroke (standard deviation=26%, n=15 image pairs). The \njet through the downstroke loop is directed approximately 18\u00b0 back from the loop\u2019s \naxis, so generates lift and thrust in a 3:1 ratio.  \nClapping, or near clapping, of the wings (Weis-Fogh 1973) also produces a discrete \nvortex loop (Fig. 6): an infrequent feature of the flow that will contribute additional \npropulsive force. Using the same approach to calculate the thrust generated by the \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.  High-lift insect aerodynamics \n 11\nclap loops suggests that they produced 2.5 times that generated by the downstroke \nloops (mean thrust from downstroke loops = 1.25mN, std = 0.48mN, n=15 image \npairs; mean thrust from clap loops =3.12mN, standard deviation =0.39mN, n=3 image \npairs). Not all wingbeats concluded with the formation of a clap loop, but these \ncalculations indicate that claps can generate considerable thrust to supplement that \ngenerated by the downstroke loops. Clap loop jet angles ranged widely from 20.9\u00b0 to \n40.3\u00b0, consistent with the hypothesis that claps may be used for pitch control (Taylor \n2001). \n \nPrevious studies (Maxworthy 1979; Van den Berg and Ellington 1997) have \nsuggested that leading-edge vortices used by insects are analogous in some respects to \nthose found on delta wing aircraft. In particular, it has been suggested that the \nleading-edge vortex may be stabilised by a strong spanwise flow toward the wing tip. \nVan den Berg and Ellington (1997) deduced that the spanwise flow on their robotic \nhawkmoth was of the same magnitude as the swirl (speed of rotation around the \nvortex axis) using qualitative techniques. In 2D DPIV this strong out of plane \ncomponent will create a perspective error which is dependent on the position in the \nobject plane as a percentage of the object distance (Reeves and Lawson 2003; Soloff \net al. 1997). In this case, if the out of plane component is the same order as the in-\nplane component, by using a lens with a focal length of 105mm and an object plane of \naround 100mm \u00d7 100mm, the perspective error has a maximum of 5% at the edge of \nthe field. This reduces to zero in the centre of the field and accounts for the range of \nerror of 2.2% - 5.5% in the error analysis. The common approach to remove this error \nis to use a stereoscopic DPIV arrangement (Prasad 2000) which is the subject of \nfurther work. \n \n \n5 \nConclusions \nDPIV and force balance data have been presented from a tethered Tobacco \nHawkmoth (Manduca sexta). The DPIV data has allowed quantitative analysis of the \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.  High-lift insect aerodynamics \n 12\ninsect\u2019s wing flow structures and wake. These DPIV results have shown the presence \nof a significant leading-edge vortex towards the end of the downstroke. This flow \nfeature confirms results from previous flow visualisation (Ellington et al. 1996). \nDirect comparisons of the DPIV results to simultaneous six component force data \nhave also shown the peak upwards force to coincide with the presence of the leading-\nedge vortex at the end of the downstroke. Lift calculations from the DPIV data using \ncirculation theory match to within 15% of the force balance data. The discrepancies \nare in part attributed to the 3D nature of the flow and the corresponding measurement \nerrors generated in this case with a 2D DPIV system. The gross structure of the near \nwake resembles vortex loops, particularly at the slower of two flight speeds (1.2ms-1).  \nThe structure of the LEV at both flight speeds resembles that previously described \nonly at the midwing position, but is shown to continue over the thorax and centreline \nof the aninal, and be continuous with both trailing vortices from the wings during late \ndownstroke. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nWork funded by BBSRC grant.
