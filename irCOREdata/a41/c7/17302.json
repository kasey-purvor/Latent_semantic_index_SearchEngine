The course, MI512: Information literacy; tools for research is six, two hour, \nhands-on workshops, supported online using Moodle. It aims to equip students with the skills to \nfind, evaluate and manage the information they need for their doctoral studies. The tutors are \ncompleting a Postgraduate Certificate in Teaching Higher Education, so have developed this \ncourse in light of their studies. Course evaluation questionnaires suggest this course is more \nbeneficial to students than attending standalone courses, as progression occurs and more \nadvanced skills are developed. It also allows the students and the tutor the opportunity to develop \na more sustained relationship and increases the profile of Library support. Support for researchers \nis a key issue, with several important reports (Rowlands et al 2008, RIN 2008) highlighting that \nresearchers lack a variety of information skills and struggle to use library databases effectively. \nMI512 provides a model of support for doctoral students that should be useful for other librarians \nand ensures LSE research students are equipped with the skills they need in their career. \n1. Background and context \nThis paper describes recent work at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) \nto redevelop an information literacy course for research students. At LSE a separate department \ncalled the Methodology Institute (MI) offer a range of courses for students undertaking research at \ndoctoral and masters level. The course MI512: Information Literacy - tools for research is one such \ncourse, although for historical reasons it is non-credit bearing. The course is taught by Library staff \nand is aimed at students undertaking a detailed literature search for the first time. Historically the \ncourse has operated as a series of standalone classes run in the autumn term and adapted from \nthe general Information Skills programme. PhD students were free to attend any of the classes and \nit was advertised via the Library website. Classes aimed to introduce students to various library \ndatabases that were useful when conducting a literature review, improve their internet searching, \nlearn citing and referencing skills and to use Endnote. Attendance had been declining over the past \nfew years, despite a growing awareness that PhD students were struggling with their literature \nsearching and that the Library should be providing them with more specialist help and advice. \nThere was also a recognition that many new web 2.0 tools could be usefully employed by \nresearchers and the Centre for Learning Technology were running a range of \u2018Digital Literacy\u2019 \nclasses which were open to PhD students. However one off classes were difficult to plan as \nstudents attending were of mixed ability and rarely attended more than one class. The class tutors, \nwho were usually Liaison Librarians or Learning Technologists, often felt they needed to try and \ncover many different aspects of library research skills in a short space of time. As different trainers \nran each class, they were not aware of the content or structure of other classes so some content \noverlapped. There was also no overall branding of the programme or the training materials. \n \nFollowing a focus group in Summer 2008 to inform the development of online resources in Moodle \nto support research students, feedback indicated that more face to face training and support was \nwelcome. This influenced the decision to redesign the programme and the course was launched in \nthe autumn term of 2008-9 as a six week programme which students were encouraged to sign up \nto in its entirety. After the first term the programme was evaluated to consider attendance figures \nand student feedback. Two of the course tutors also registered for the Postgraduate Certificate in \nTeaching in Higher Education, to help inform their teaching and the course design. MI512 served \nas the basis for the assignments they completed during 2008-9 and several teaching observations \nwere carried out as part of the requirements for their course, which is accredited by the Higher \nEducation Academy. \n2. Literature review \nSeveral recent studies (Rowlands et al 2008, RIN 2008) have highlighted the need for information \nliteracy training and support for doctoral level students. Students struggle with finding, managing \nand evaluating information about recent research suggests that teaching information literacy to \n 2\nresearchers will remain an important role for librarians, but they do need to ensure there is \nsufficient take up of the services they offer. (RIN, 2007, p.49). There is also a need to differentiate \nthe support for researchers from support offered to undergraduate or taught Masters students to \nhighlight the higher level skills and to teach researchers the \u2018tricks of the trade\u2019 (RIN, 2007 p.49). \nRowlands et all (2008) argued that the notion of a \u2018Google generation\u2019 being distinct from other \ngenerations is a myth, but questioned whether we too late to change the \u2018ingrained coping \nbehaviour\u2019 that students have learnt from relying heavily on internet search engines. (CIBER \nreport, p.23). The CIBER report also found that students consistently overestimate their information \nskills which leads them to avoid attending training (CIBER report, p.24). While motivation is an \nimportant issue in terms of encouraging students to attend optional training, at doctoral level LSE \nhave found this is less of a problem. Nevertheless much literature suggests that embedding \ninformation literacy into the curriculum and teaching it within the context of a discipline are often \nthe key to success in information literacy programmes. Finally, reports (CLEX, 2009) predicted \nwhat future students will expect from their university education and library services, given their \nexperience of using Web 2.0 technologies, i.e. technologies that enable communication, \ncollaboration, participation and sharing. It found that the use of Web 2.0 is pervasive across all age \ngroups and has already \u201chad a profound effect on behaviours\u201d; \u201cusing Web2.0 technologies leads \nto development of a strong sense of communities of interest\u201d   but \u201chas also led to impatience \u2026 to \na casual approach to evaluating information and attributing it and also to copyright and legal \nconstraints\u201d. The report recognised that \u201cinformation literacies were a \u201ca significant and growing \ndeficit area\u201d. \n3. Set up and organisation of the course \nBased on the findings from the literature and the experiences of the focus group, work was \nundertaken in Summer 2008 to redesign the support for researchers offered by the Library and \nCentre for Learning Technology. The decision to make the MI512 course six consecutive \nworkshops meant that student progression could be monitored and the skills and knowledge learnt \nin early classes could be built upon over course. The curriculum design was also influenced by the \nSCONUL Seven Pillars of Information Literacy. (SCONUL, 1999) which is widely used in UK higher \neducation. The course outline is presented in more detail below.  \n3.1 MI512: Course Outline \nEach session is a two hour workshop. Online support is available through LSE\u2019s virtual learning \nenvironment, Moodle. The workshops include: \n \nWeek 1: Introduction to Literature Searching: finding books and journals, using Cross Searcher \n(LSE\u2019s federated search engine), using IBSS and using ISI Citation indexes, finding materials not \nstocked at LSE. \nWeek 2: Going Beyond Google: Quality issues, using Google Advanced Search, using Google \nScholar and Google Books, iGoogle, other search engines, using Intute and Delicious. \nWeek 3: Finding newspapers, thesis, conference papers: Using Nexis, using the Index to \ntheses\/Ethos, using ZETOC, what are pre-prints and finding research publications including LSE \nResearch Online. \nWeek 4: Citing and Referencing for your thesis: Introduction to the Harvard method, managing \nyour references, citing books, journal and web pages, using Delicious to store web references. \nWeek 5: Using Endnote: Introduction to Endnote, adding records manually, importing records \nfrom the Library Catalogue and from IBSS, producing a simple bibliography, selecting and applying \na range of bibliographic styles. \nWeek 6: Keeping up to date and next steps: Setting up e-mail alerts, citation searching in ISI, \nIntroduction to RSS, using Google Reader to read feeds, social networks and e-mail lists. Getting \nhelp in the future. \n3.2 Class structure \nClasses were structured to include a combination of presentations, live demonstrations and time \nfor hands-on activities. Following feedback from a teaching observation in the autumn term, the \nclass structure was modified in January 2009, to include shorter presentations and demonstrations \n 3\nfrom the tutors and more time for hands-on activities. The tutors aimed to present and demonstrate  \nfor no more than 15 minutes before allowing hands on practice \u2013  usually talking for just 5-10 \nminutes with brief explanations of accessing resources, a quick tour of how to use them and most \nimportantly why they are relevant for the students to use. Students were encouraged to watch the \npresentations during this time and not to start trying the exercises until the allocated time. \n \nActivities were grouped so that students had longer hands-on sessions, instead of illustrating each \nactivity separately and then allowing for a few minutes for each activity. This made it clearer which \nparts of the session were for activities and which parts students should be facing the presenters \nscreen. By grouping activities together it also enabled the more advanced students to skip those \nexercises with which they were familiar and to concentrate on the parts which were new to them. \nGrouping the hands on exercises together in longer segments also enabled the tutors to spend \nlonger providing roving help and answering student queries. In all the activities students were \nencouraged to carry out real searches related to their research topic, rather than run searches as \ndirected by the tutors. This meant that students often left the session having found new material for \ntheir literature search. \n3.3 Teaching Materials \nLesson plans were used to plan and structure each class and they were modified after each term, \nbut particularly following feedback from a teaching observation in November 2008. The tutors \nprepared class handouts and a PowerPoint to use during the session, although live demonstrations \nof various library databases and search tools were also used. After the first term of teaching, the \ntutors became aware that student abilities were varied and they decided to develop a pre-course \nassessment form, which has been used since January 2009. This form ask students about their \nbackground, their experience of library databases and their confidence in several areas. A post-\ncourse assessment form was also devised to gather feedback at the end of the programme and by \ncomparing the results, progression could be monitored.  \n \nIn the autumn term of 2008, short activity sheets were given to students along with copies of the \nPowerPoint slides which contained considerable amount of extra details. Again following feedback \nas part of a teaching observation, the activity sheets were revised to become class workbooks. The \ntutors found students did not follow the activity sheets and sometimes waited to be shown what to \ndo. Much essential information also previously appeared on the slides, and so these were reduced \nin terms of the quantity and amount of text they contained. The tutors decided to make the slides \navailable via Moodle rather than give out handouts. The workbooks now include handy hints and \ntips, such as reasons why the featured database is useful, further activities for those more \nadvanced or already familiar with the featured databases, screen shots and clearer instructions.  \n \nThe tutors found following this modification students found it easier to follow the class tasks and to \nunderstand why they are useful. The students all found useful information and resources for their \nthesis during the activities as they were encouraged to search for material on their topic. Another \nadvantage of clearer course workbooks was that students could download them from Moodle and \nwork through them at their own pace if they missed a session. \n3.4 Use of Moodle \nLSE use Moodle as their institutional VLE, with most undergraduate and taught masters courses \nhaving a presence. The model of blended learning, where teaching is largely face to face with \nadditional support provided in Moodle is widely used across the School. The tutors felt that \nproviding online support for MI512 would be valuable in the classroom, but would also support \nstudents between classes and after the programme finished. The course was structured so that \neach weekly section contained links to the class workbook, PowerPoint and quick links to relevant \nresources. Moodle was integrated into the classroom with interactive tasks and quick access links \nto resources such as the various databases that were being used. In any academic year, students \nfrom each of the three cohorts (the course now runs once each term) retained access to Moodle \nafter the end of the course. This was upon the request of students taking the course.  A screenshot \nfrom Moodle is presented in Figure 1.  \n 4\n \nFigure 1: MI512 in Moodle \n \n \n \nIn addition to providing resources and teaching materials, the Moodle discussion forum was used \nto deliver news and reminders to students which Moodle also delivers via e-mail. Each week a \ndiscussion forum for the class where students could raise issues or share useful anecdotes with \neach other was available. \n3.5 Research Feedback \nSince January 2009, all students on MI512 are asked to complete pre-course assessment which \nincluded a space for them to provide more information about their research topic. By  \ncompleting details of their research topic, the tutors had a better understanding of the subjects \nrepresented. However the form was also an incentive for students to see the benefit of the course \nat the outset and to encourage them to remain engaged after the first class. Each student received \nfeedback from their liaison librarian on their research topic which indicated the more appropriate \ndatabases to search (and how they could be accessed) useful websites, other libraries and advice \non their search strategies. The feedback form also helped the tutors deal with the different subject \nspecialisms as they were now able to give more detailed advice to students during the hands on \nexercises. \n3.6 Team teaching \nEach workshop in the programme has been team taught by two members of staff to allow the \nsessions to accommodate up to 25 students at a time. This has included three liaison librarians \nand the Learning Technology Librarian, but where possible the same two members of staff teach \nfor the entire six weeks. Team teaching has allowed the tutors to provide support for each other \nand it also allows for more variation in the class. Both tutors provide roving help to students during \nthe hands on sessions This is particularly helpful when dealing with mixed ability groups as trainers \ncan encourage students working at different levels during the hands on exercises. It is also useful \n 5\nto have several staff available so as to provide cover during sickness or absence. However the \nstudents clearly appreciated having the same trainers throughout the term to built-up a rapport. \nThey also called upon the staff expertise occasionally outside the classroom. \n \nWhilst team teaching can be seen as a staff development opportunity, a chance to train up a less \nexperienced member of staff, it is important to stress that both staff play an active role in each \nworkshop. The member of staff not actively presenting needs to keep an eye on the room, check \nthat all students are understanding the demonstration and also to be ready to chip in with relevant \nexamples and illustrations if required. \n3.7 Reflections on MI512 \nRunning MI512 as a six week course helped the tutors build a relationship and greater \nunderstanding of the needs of individual students. Simply knowing a students\u2019 name and more \nabout their research improved the relationship between library staff and students. The tutors found \ntheir confidence as teachers increased, partly from undertaking the PG Cert, but also from seeing \nthe same group regularly and building a rapport. Consequently the tutors were able to adopt a \nmore informal manner in the classroom which is more difficult to achieve in standalone classes. \n \nProgression was an important factor in MI512, with student attending weekly classes. They built on \nskills and their confidence grew week by week in way not seen in other one off library training \nsessions at LSE. This meant the training had a greater impact on students and developed their \nskills to a higher level. One important factor that contributed to the success of the programme was \nstudent were able to use their own research topic in the hands-on activities. This can be harder to \nachieve in standalone classes as tutors usually prepare generic searches. Feedback from students \nalso revealed that they were happy to attend a programme of classes and many commented that \nthey set aside the time each week to build up their skills. \n4. Attendance, students feedback and observations \nInterest in MI512 was high throughout 2008-9 and it has been fully booked in 2009-10 despite no \nreal change to the publicity that is used for other information skills classes. The course was \nadvertised via the Library website, via direct emails to departments by Liaison Librarians, and by \nemail via the Teaching and Learning Centre. The course is also publicised alongside other \nMethodology Institute courses in the LSE online calendar, which lists details of all the courses at \nLSE. After the first term, word of mouth and personal recommendations from other students was \nan important way that students found out about it. Given the popularity of the course waiting lists \nwere kept each term and students on the list were given first refusal for booking on subsequent \nterms.  \n4.1 Student attendance and engagement \nThe bookings and attendance were  \n \n\u2022 Autumn Term 2008: bookings 25:  \n\u2022 Spring Term 2009 bookings 28: (16 people on waiting list) \n\u2022 Summer Term 2009 bookings: 19 : (10 people on waiting list) \n\u2022 Autumn Term 2009: bookings 27 \n\u2022 Spring Term 2010: bookings 27 \n\u2022 Summer Term 2010: bookings 18 \n \nThe decision to run the course three times was based on its popularity in the first two terms and \nhad not been anticipated. Summer term attendance was lower than in the first two terms, as may \nbe expected, but news of the course still generated interest amongst the students. \n \nAnother benefit of building up a rapport between tutors and students and in having a more \nformalised programme was that students did send apologies if they were unable to attend and they \ndid study course materials for weeks they had missed due to illness. \n 6\n4.3 Evaluation \nEvaluation forms were circulated to all participants to gather feedback on the course each term. \nNatural feedback in the classroom captured by the tutors as part of the reflection they did for their \nteaching qualification, also suggested there was a positive atmosphere, with high levels of student \nengagement.  \n \nFeedback forms from the Michaelmas and Lent term showed that all students rated the course \nExcellent or Good with all classes highly rated but classes 2, 3 and 6 had highest ratings. In the \nsecond two terms student progression was measured as students were asked to evaluate their \nskills before and after attending. The results were impressive showing clearly increased confidence \nand they were presented at a recent conference (Macrae-Gibson & Secker, 2009): \n \nStudent confidence before attending the programme: \nFinding published literature \u2013 2.9 \nSearching the internet \u2013 2.85 \n \nStudent confidence after attending the programme \nFinding published literature \u2013 4.5 \nSearching the internet \u2013 4.3 \n \nThis success was repeated in the Lent term 2010 \n \nStudent confidence before attending the programme: \nFinding published literature \u2013 2.23 \nSearching the internet \u2013 3.11 \n \nStudent confidence after attending the programme \nFinding published literature \u2013 4.06 \nSearching the internet \u2013 4.00 \n \n \nWhilst there can be drawbacks with self assessment as students can over or under-estimate their \nown (Walsh, 2009 p. 23 cites Maughan (2001) on this further) this does clearly show that the \nstudents felt they had benefited from the course and that the learning outcomes had been \nsuccessful. Qualitative feedback from the forms was also enlightening and showed a high level of \nengagement with the course. Some sample quotes have been included below: \n \nI liked that this was a 6 week course and you could build up your information literacy \u2026 I \nliked the pre-course needs analysis form and individual suggestions for search sources.  ,  \n \nI thought the teaching was excellent. [The tutors] were approachable and I liked the \ninteractive nature of the classes.,  \n \nSince it has been 12 years since I was last doing this kind of stuff this was a real eye \nopener in terms of what is out there to help with research. It was well organised and an \nexcellent combination of explanation and exercises.  \n \nThis was excellent and came at exactly the right time for me (first year) and I have \nrecommended it to lots of people. The feedback form was also thoroughly useful. Thanks! \n \nLoved the way the instructors managed a good mix of lecturing and hands on experience \non PCs. Length of talking was just perfect, whenever I got twitchy to try out their ideas on a \nPC, the opportunity just emerged - there was no frustration wanting to try something whilst \nwaiting for teacher to stop droning on. Well done! Frankly all the classes were useful, \nsimply because they made me aware of stuff I didn't know. \n \n \n 7\nFinally one of the quotes the tutors were particularly proud of was: \n \nWithout exaggeration, this is the most well prepared, organised and professional course \nI\u2019ve ever experienced in my life. The pre-class organisation is impressive, the Moodle \nresources outstanding, the hand outs just right, the co-teaching smooth and collegial, the \nfollow-up effective. I will keep this course in mind as a model for when I prepare my own \ncourse in the future.  \n5. Benefits to students \nThere have been numerous benefits to running this course as a six week programme, which were \npartly gauged from the tutors\u2019 reflections and also from student feedback. The benefits to students \nincluded:  \n\u2022 The course was seen as a good investment of time, as it saved the students time in the \nlong run and helped ensure they were using appropriate sources and databases for their \nresearch \u2013 concerns that they had been \u2018missing something\u2019 from the literature were \ncommon and students believed MI512 gave them the skills to know where to search. \n\u2022 Students valued the feedback from liaison librarians on useful resources, search strategies \nand other libraries for their research topic provided via the feedback forms. Students were \nalso put in contact with their liaison librarian so they could get ongoing support during their \nresearch. \n\u2022 All class activities focused on the students own topics so that they built up research skills \nand find useful information in a safe learning environment. Each week they left the \nclassroom having discovered new useful resources and articles and so could very quickly \nsee the practical benefits of the course. \n\u2022 Students were able to meet other research students from across the School and work \ntogether to help each other and share ideas \u2013 isolation is a particular problem for PhD \nstudents who may struggle to meet other researchers outside their department. \n\u2022 Although the course is aimed at students who were starting an extensive literature search, \nothers from different stages of their research attended and commented that they found it \nuseful. \n \n6.The Post Graduate Certificate and MI512 \nThe lead tutors on MI512 decided to enrol in the Post Graduate Certificate in Teaching in Higher \nEducation (PGCHE) in Autumn 2008 to gain a formal recognition of their role as teachers at LSE \nand for their own personal development. The course is accredited by the Higher Education \nAcademy and run by the Teaching and Learning Centre at LSE. All graduate teaching assistants \nand new lecturers also complete this qualification. The course includes five modules covering: \nplanning your teaching year, student learning, feedback and assessment, quality assurance and \ncourse design. More specific benefits of the PGCHE included: \n \n\u2022 The Teaching and Learning Centre gave advice during teaching observations which helped \nthe tutors amend the structure of classes and hands on practice sessions in 2008-9. \n\u2022 Learning theory literature helped the tutors see how students engage with the class and \ncourse materials. \n\u2022 As part of the module on student learning the tutors had to track student progress and \nconsider their backgrounds and progress in far greater detail than would normally be the \ncase with an elective class. This enabled us to understand the students more fully and to \nsee how their backgrounds and prior knowledge impacted on their class attitudes and \nperformance. Seeing the students as individuals helped develop tutor\/student rapport \n\u2022 The quality assurance module explored issues which impacted on LSE\u2019s information \nliteracy training as a whole. If IL is to become more embedded in the curriculum or to be \ncredit bearing then quality assurance measures will be vital \n\u2022 The course design module enabled tutors to consider planning future sessions, and \nespecially to reflect on how these could be embedded with sessions on academic writing \nmore broadly \n 8\n\u2022 Whilst MI512 is a voluntary course, the PG Cert enabled tutors to consider a whole range of \nassessment options including those for non credit bearing courses \n\u2022 Completing the certificate also gave weight to the programme especially if the tutors decide \nto roll it out on a more formal basis. It demonstrates that the Library and Centre for \nLearning Technology are serious about providing quality training and supporting \nresearchers. \n7. Other improvements at LSE  \nThere are a number of other benefits that the work on MI512 has had on library training more \ngenerally. For example, improvements to the structure of classes and training materials have been \nrolled out to classes in the Information Skills programme. MI512 also illustrated the value of using \nMoodle in classes and the importance of developing a blended learning approach to training (i.e. \nface to face in conjunction with online support). MI512 offers a number of opportunities to roll out \ntraining to specific departments, for example one tutor now runs a three week series of workshops \nfor Social Policy PhD students, utilising the departments own pre-existing research seminar slots \nas a way of embedding information literacy  into departmental study.  \nThe topic feedback forms have also been adapted and now form part of the Liaison Librarian\u2019s \ngeneral support to PhD students via LSE Library\u2019s research postcard service. These postcards \nallow PhD students to complete brief details of their topic so that Liaison Librarians can send them \nfeedback on appropriate databases and websites. Whilst not as extensive as the MI512 forms they \nhave been a very useful tool in providing information to researchers and in developing the rapport \nbetween Liaison Librarians and their academic departments. \n \nAnother benefit has been the course is an excellent example of collaboration between learning \ntechnologists and Library staff and highlights areas where training overlaps the common interests \nof the two teams. The Digital Literacy programme which includes a range of complementary \nclasses for staff and PhD students is another example of the two teams working collaboratively to \nprovide training. The use of team teaching was also highly valuable and has allowed tutors to \nbenefit from the skills and expertise of colleagues and to develop their own approaches as a result. \nFinally the course materials used in MI512 have been adapted to provide workbooks for classes on \nthe general programme, thus avoiding any duplications of effort. \n \nHowever, perhaps more importantly the work on MI512 has underlined the value of progression so \nthat students have an opportunity to develop their skills over time. It has also highlighted the \nimportance of embedding information skills into the curriculum at LSE. In light of the success of this \nprogramme, the course director for a new core course that all LSE undergraduate students will \ntake from 2010-11 (known as LSE100) have recognised the importance of developing students\u2019 \ninformation skills. Of the ten learning objectives for LSE100, three are information skills, including: \nfind and accessing information, evaluating information and managing information and avoiding \nplagiarism. The success of MI512 added weight to the argument that both the Library and CLT play \na central role in teaching as well as supporting students learning through more traditional means. \n8. MI512: building on success  \nMI512 has now run six times in total. Interest will be monitored to determine whether MI512 will run \nregularly three times per year. The staff commitment for this course is considerable, with classes \nrequiring two trainers at least one of whom must be available for all weeks. Discussions are still \nongoing about who should provide this support, as a sufficient number of staff are now familiar with \nthe programme and, subject to availability, able to teach it. The time commitment is substantial with \n12 hours contact time with students, plus additional time each week to prepare for classes and \nupdate workbooks and the Moodle course. \n  \nIn terms of revising the programme it has run largely unchanged in 2009-10, so time planning \nclasses and revising workbooks is significantly reduced. One area where the course does take up \ntime is the administration at the start of the term and in photocopying course materials. Since \nMarch 2010, the User Education Team in the Library has a dedicated library assistant who \nprovides additional support for the course, taking bookings and photocopying the workbooks. One \n 9\nof the liaison librarians has become the course convenor in line with LSE practices and the CLT \nwill continue to be involved in the course providing consultancy and acting as a tutor.  \n \nOne logistical issue that has proved problematic has been finding suitable rooms at LSE to run the \nclass as the Library Training Room only seats 12 students. Requests to the Timetable team are \nnow submitted, which should improve the advanced publicity that can be sent to students about the \ndate and location of the course.  \n \nIn terms of rolling out the training of MI512 more widely to other training staff, the course benefits \nfrom experienced, sympathetic trainers. It is recommended that any new trainers in the team \nconsider undertaking the teaching qualification. Staff not teaching on MI512 in any particular term \nare available for classes in the general information skills programme and cam bring their extra \nexpertise to the successful running of these classes.  \n \n9. Conclusion \nThis article has demonstrated how support for PhD students at LSE has been improved \ndramatically through developing a six week information literacy course. Research students require \nsupport and training in a range of different areas which cannot be covered within the scope of a \nsingle class. Meanwhile, progression is important to build up the range of skills a researcher needs \nand yet currently this course is still optional and it is not credit bearing. \n \nThe Library have disseminated stories of the success of MI512 across the School with the hope \nthat more library skills training can be offered within departments. All departments provide some \nform of research training for their PhD students but these do not necessarily include library skills, \nor if they do these could be limited to a single session or even just a lecture style presentation. \nLibrary skills could be embedded in the departments\u2019 provision by utilising these research seminar \nslots - as is the case with the three Library sessions that are run for the Social Policy department. \n  \nIn the future there may also be a case for making these modules compulsory and attaching some \nform of accreditation to them to encourage participation. However, this will clearly take additional \ntime for liaison librarians so resourcing this additional work may need to be considered. Information \nliteracy is a key skill for the researcher of the future and it is vital that librarians play an active role \nin teaching in this area. MI512 illustrates LSE\u2019s commitment to enhancing the skills of its \nresearchers through a dedicated programme. \nReferences \nCommittee of Inquiry into the Changing Learner Experience (2009) Higher Education in a Web 2.0 \nWorld.
