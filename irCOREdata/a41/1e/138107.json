In an effort to \nrespond to the apparent failure of existing approaches to loss prevention, this chapter \nintroduces a \u2018process-orientated\u2019 approach to tackling shrinkage.  The approach consists of a \nprescriptive series of seven steps that form a stock loss reduction \u2018road map\u2019, together with \nassociated techniques and tools for undertaking each step.  \nIntroduction \nRecent research has once again demonstrated the extent of the problem of shrinkage for \nretailers and suppliers of Fast Moving Consumer Goods, FMCG2.  Losses in this \u20ac824.4 \nbillion3 industry were found to equate to 2.31 per cent of turnover, 1.75 per cent for retailers \nand 0.56 per cent for manufacturers, resulting in annual bill for shrinkage of \u20ac18 billion.  \nIn some respects, there is nothing new about attempting to quantify the cost of stock loss4. \nHowever it is increasingly clear that not only is the problem enormous, it is the fact that this \nissue seems resilient to ameliorative actions.  This failure draws into question the \neffectiveness of the world-wide market for security \u2018solutions\u2019, for example closed circuit \ntelevision (CCTV), electronic article surveillance (EAS), guarding and store detectives, and \nthe effectiveness of the multi-billion Euro global industry.  It could be argued that this \nexpenditure, \u2018keeps a lid\u2019 on losses and contains them to relatively acceptable levels.  \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 3\nHowever this approach seems only to be an argument of convenience although proving this to \nbe the case is currently beyond most established methodologies.  \nRecent research has shown that between only 20-40 per cent of loss is accounted for by \nexternal theft5.  Hence, many of the technology-led solutions such as electronic article \nsurveillance (EAS) are only capable of impacting on a minority of modes of stock loss.  They \nmake little or no impact on delivery and warehouse staff theft or losses through product going \nout of date due to poor company ordering procedures.  Accordingly, this article seeks to \nprovide a new methodology that can be used by shrinkage practitioners to enable them to \nbegin to adopt a more studied approach to dealing with the problem.  It is based upon original \nresearch carried out throughout the FMCG sector in Europe by academics specialising in \nsupply chain management and security management.   \nThis approach, termed here as a \u2018road map\u2019, charts the various steps that need to be taken in \norder for a more holistic and systematic approach to be taken.  This roadmap aims to \nsupersede existing approaches that are characteristically partial, piecemeal and for the most \npart poorly conceived practices.  In doing so, the intention is to lead organisations to face up \nto their large and growing bill for shrinkage whilst also presenting them with a rich \nopportunity to dramatically improve their profitability. \nMethodology \nThis study used a methodology based upon two approaches: a review of the existing \nliterature; and investigative fieldwork exploring 12 FMCG supply chains. The analysis of \nthese supply chains required an investigation of 17 companies, including manufacturers, \ndistributors and retailers, on 41 sites in 10 European countries.  Following the flow of \nproducts through FMCG supply chains in a structured manner required both a systematic and \nsystemic approach.  Being systematic, this research was methodically arranged and \nundertaken according to plan.  The systemic nature of this work referred to the focus on each \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 4\nsupply chain as a single process by integrating research undertaken at the separate sites along \neach supply chain. \nEach site visit, whether at a manufacturing company, distributor or a retailer, consisted of \nstructured interviews with members of the senior management team and managers responsible \nfor security, logistics and stock loss.  In addition to the interviews, goods were physically \nfollowed through sites in order to document the supply chain process and to identify the \npractices and procedures used to facilitate this process and to control losses.  The \ninvestigation made use of Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) to examine the various \nways that a process may fail and to determine the effect of the different failure modes.  \nThrough focussing attention upon stock loss, and by using the FMEA technique, it was \npossible understand the:  \n\u2022 Ways in which the supply chain process can fail and allow stock to be lost \n\u2022 Severity of the loss should a failure happen \n\u2022 Likelihood of a failure occurring \n\u2022 Ability to detect that a failure has occurred \nThe data collated from the process analysis and interviews allowed a composite model of the \nsupply chains to be constructed.  This provided the basis from which the performance of the \nsupply chains was analysed and the conclusions drawn. \nThe \u2018Road Map\u2019 \nIn theory, the concept of stock loss reduction is simple.  It can be described in terms of the \nthree following steps:  \n\u2022 Make stock highly visible so that loss is immediately noticed  \n\u2022 Quickly identify the cause of the loss  \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 5\n\u2022 Implement preventative solutions to resolve the cause of the loss and thus prevent \nreoccurrence of the problem \nDifficulties in implementation arise for a wide number of reasons.  Not least is the complexity \nof the sector, the absence of reliable data on the extent and nature of the problem and a lack of \nco-operation both within companies and between companies in the supply chain to develop \nshared solutions.  Underpinning these issues is the difficulties associated with managing \nchange, particularly the lack of a clear method for undertaking stock loss reduction projects.  \nStock Loss Reduction Principles \nIn order to overcome the inhibitors to stock loss reduction, the stock loss reduction roadmap is \nconstructed around the application of three key principles: \n\u2022 Holistic \n\u2022 Systematic \n\u2022 Collaborative \nThese three principles underpin the structure of the roadmap and also the method for applying \nit.  The roles of these three principles are described below. \nHolistic \nResolving stock loss requires businesses to take a holistic approach to identifying and \nanalysing stock loss problems from a supply chain perspective.  Supply chains consist of \nprocesses made up of diverse, interlinked tasks and hence analysing the processes opens up \nthe \u2018black box\u2019 of the supply chain.  Taking this process-orientated approach to the \ninvestigation of both individual activities and whole organisations allows both the trees and \nthe forest to be analysed.  It also ensures the realities of work practices are considered in \nparallel with the supply chain\u2019s overall function.  \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 6\nSystematic \nThe complexity inherent in supply chains requires their investigation to be undertaking in a \nsystematic manner.  Being systematic requires planning the investigation methodically and \nundertaken this work according to the plan.   For example where a site visit is required, \nwhether at a manufacturing company, distributor or a retailer, this visit needs to consist of \nstructured data gathering through interviews to collate the following information and data: \n\u2022 Stock loss statistics \n\u2022 Company methods to identify stock loss \n\u2022 Extent of staff and external theft \n\u2022 Company methods to reduce stock loss \n\u2022 Justification for the methods of reducing stock loss \n\u2022 Impact of loss prevention methods on sales \nIn addition, the structure of material handling and information exchange processes is \nunderstood through physically following goods through the material handling processes.  This \nis undertaken in order to document the activities and associated practices and procedures used \nto facilitate this process and control loss.   \nCollaborative \nCollaboration within a company provides the means to resolve problems beyond the scope of \nindividual functions to solve.  Likewise, collaboration between companies resolves communal \nproblems beyond the scope of the separate companies to solve.  The results of this work will \nbe to: \n\u2022 Design loss prevention solutions into the fabric of processes and facilities \n\u2022 Ensure that these solutions effectively contribute to total supply chain efficiency, \ninstead of solving a problem at one end of the chain only \n\u2022 Implement simpler and cheaper controls to minimise loss \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 7\nStock Loss Reduction Roadmap Structure \nThe stock loss reduction \u2018roadmap\u2019 seeks to overcome the inhibitors to successful loss \nprevention by employing a method for reducing stock loss consisting of: \n\u2022 A general approach to stock loss reduction \n\u2022 Specific tools and techniques for dealing with specific problems \nThe roadmap is intended as a manual or guide, describing the overall activities that need to be \nundertaken in order to reduce stock loss.  This guide consists of a general approach made up \nof the steps a company needs to follow, together with techniques and tools to help undertake \neach phase and to deal with problems that may be encountered.  The general approach that \nforms the heart of the guide is shown in Figure 1.  This structure is systematic and provides \nthe means for planning and undertaking stock loss reduction projects while guiding users \ntowards continuous improvement through the cycle.  \nInsert figure 1 about here \nThe roadmap is designed to enable both problem diagnosis and solution implementation.  The \nstructure consists of a sequence of steps where through well-planned investigation, pressing \nbusiness needs are identified.  These needs are responded to by undertaking small-scale \nexperiments that explore the stock loss problem, identify likely causes and develop \nappropriate solutions.  The solutions are tested in trials where their effectiveness is assessed.  \nWhere a solution is found to be successful it is then implemented widely and the business\u2019s \npractices standardised around it.   \nThis approach to stock loss reduction recognises that given the uniqueness of each business \nenvironment where stock loss occurs, the prescription of a single, \u2018right\u2019 strategy for reducing \nstock loss is inappropriate.  Instead, whilst a basic structure is provided, the approach is \nintended to be tailored to match prevailing circumstances in order for it to be effective.  \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 8\nThe approach described in this chapter provides a means for involving all company \nemployees in stock loss reduction.  Widespread participation provides knowledge of current \npractices, such as stock control, and helps build commitment that allow changes to be \nimplemented.   \nTo help undertake the steps of the general approach, a number of techniques and tools are \nrecommended.  These have been chosen to aid communication and understanding.  This list is \nnot comprehensive and prospective users should introduce their own tools where they find \nthem to have a better fit given the prevailing local circumstances. \nFigure 1 shows the roadmap as consisting of six sequential steps, that join to form a circle of \ndiagnosis and implementation.  These steps are described below in more detail, along with a \nnumber of techniques and tools that can be used to help accomplish the objectives of each \nstep and overcome problems that may be encountered. \nStep 0: Recognise that Stock Loss Shrinks Profit and Sales \nAs related research has shown, the FMCG sector in Europe suffers significant losses each \nyear through shrinkage (\u20ac18 billion)6.  These losses occur all along the supply chain: from \npoint of manufacture, throughout the distribution process, to the point of sale.  While \u20ac10 \nbillion of this loss cannot be accounted for, the effects of shrinkage are clear: the shopper \nsuffers through added cost and poorer service.  The outlook for retailers, manufacturers and \nconsumers concerning shrinkage is bleak unless action is taken quickly.   \nWhilst current levels of stock loss are significant, future levels are likely to increase.  Food \nretailers continue to expand the number of non-food items they carry, such as CDs, clothes \nand electrical items, which are products perceived by them to be at greatest risk of theft.  In \ngeneral, current attempts to address shrinkage are characterised by a heavy reliance upon \nreactive strategies that are only triggered when a particular problem become intolerable.  Such \nknee jerk and insular reactions not only fail to resolve the causes of loss, but they can also \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 9\nhave a detrimental effect upon the profitability of a company.  For instance, adopting \n\u2018defensive merchandising\u2019 can cause problems with replenishment and availability.  Hence, \nthe first step in the road map is twofold: \n\u2022 Wake up to the magnitude of the stock loss problem \n\u2022 Recognise that current approaches to stock loss reduction generally do not work.  \nStep 1: Develop a Strategic Plan \nCurrent efforts to contain stock loss are at best piece-meal, with few companies operating an \norganisation-wide approach to resolving the problem.  Companies need to recognise that \ntraditional approaches, that is only tasking security, audit or health and safety departments \nwith the challenge, are not effectual in tackling the structural deficiencies in business \noperations that are the root cause of stock loss.  Instead, companies need to change their \napproach to resolving stock loss and make use of a wider range of skills and resources.  In \nchanging their approach, companies need to choose one that is systematic, holistic and \ncollaborative.  \nApplying the Principle of Being \u2018Holistic\u2019 \nEffective stock loss reduction requires companies to be holistic by identifying, for the supply \nchain as a whole, where problems occur and can best be resolved.  Such work requires \ncollaboration along supply chains between suppliers, distributors and retailers as well as \nacross the FMCG sector as a whole.  Only when internal and external problems are \nconsidered together can comprehensive analysis be undertaken to deliver early, tangible \nresults.  Currently, companies are simply not taking advantage of the opportunities to share \nexpertise with either their competitors or suppliers, or indeed internally7.  For example, only \none-half of all retailers and manufacturers are working together to tackle stock loss.  This \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 10\nclearly demonstrates that problems affecting the whole of the supply chain are not being \naddressed in a holistic manner. \nApplying the Principle of Being \u2018Systematic\u2019 \nIn general, stock loss is not currently approached in a systematic manner.  In order to break \naway from the culture of half-truths and anecdotes, a systematic approach provides the way \nfor a company to quantify and prioritise its problems, to analyse the causes of these problems \nand to direct its available resources to the most cost effective solutions.  Finally, the true \neffectiveness of these solutions needs to be determined after their implementation and this \ninformation then used to guide future investment.  Hence the first step in the systematic \napproach to stock loss reduction is planning and the last step is the evaluation of the \neffectiveness of actions.   \nPlanning is based upon clear, realistic, attainable objectives with criteria for knowing when \nthese objectives are met.  This requires the project team responsible for delivering loss \nreductions to have answers to the following questions:  \n\u2022 What is the supply chain process to be improved?  \n\u2022 When does the supply process to be improved start and finish?  \n\u2022 What are the goals of the stock loss reduction activity?  \n\u2022 When is the date by which some benefits must be felt?  \n\u2022 What are the attributes of the ideal supply process?  \n\u2022 What are the constraints to improvement?  \n\u2022 What are the stock loss threats faced by the company?  \n \nThe answers to these questions guide the project team\u2019s activities towards achieving their \ngoals.  Starting the project in this way is especially important in cross-functional\/inter-\nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 11\ncompany projects where the effectiveness and efficiency with which project resources are \nused dramatically improves with up-front investment in planning. \nStep 2: Map Key Processes and Measure Problem \nReducing stock loss begins with a rigorous diagnosis of the problem.  This diagnosis starts by \nunderstanding the nature of the losses and then identifying their causes.  Understanding the \ncurrent operational system and processes is also the first step in gaining widespread \nrecognition of the problem and establishing the need to change within an organisation.  The \nact of creating a business process model that identifies the source of stock loss can develop \nthe critical momentum required to change existing behaviour.   \nA process-led approach to reducing stock loss applies process analysis to the stock loss \nproblem and emphasises prevention.  This provides the means to identify and prevent system \nand procedural losses, which also reduces loss from theft by removing the opportunity to \nabuse deficient systems.  \n \nThe starting point for taking a process orientated approach to diagnosing stock loss is to \nundertake process mapping and measurement.  These two techniques are described below. \nProcess Mapping  \nProcess mapping is a technique used to detail business processes that focuses on the important \nelements that influence behaviour, allowing the business to be viewed at a glance8.  Mapping \nand measuring a process establishes the performance base line that enables the effectiveness \nof solutions to be measured.  An example of a top-level supply chain is depicted in Figure 2.  \nThis diagram shows two supply chains from Gillette in the UK to two of their customers, ICA \nin Sweden and Tesco in Hungary.  \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 12\nInsert figure 2 about here \nWhilst this gives an understanding of the total supply chain, it provides few details.  In order \nto show more in-depth information, a more rigorous process map is required.  Simple flow \ncharting techniques are often the most appropriate technique to use when process mapping for \nthe first time.   \nThe data for creating a process maps is best collated by physically following products as they \npass along the supply chain.  This involves visiting each site that the products pass through \nand documenting the steps involved in receiving, storing and dispatching them.  Figure 3 is an \nexample of a process map showing the flow of products through a distribution centre.   \nInsert figure 3 about here \nThis presents the steps involved in receiving, storing and dispatching goods in a simple \ngraphical format.  Even when the flow chart does not provide a complete or totally accurate \nmodel of a process it will significantly add to understanding by promoting and \ncommunicating a process-orientated approach to improvements9.   \nHot Products \n Processes and systems usually contain a large number of separate products.  Rather than map \nall the various routes taken by all the different items it is appropriate in the initial cycle of \nanalysis to focus on \u2018hot products\u201910.  These products illustrate general features of the supply \nchain and expose major problems inherent within it.  \u2018Hot products\u2019 is a concept that many \nretailers and manufacturers are familiar with, and generally refers to those products most \nattractive to thieves.  If retailers and manufacturers were to gain a better idea of what makes a \nproduct \u2018hot\u2019, then this could, by reducing the levels of the theft element within stock loss, \nhelp dramatically reduce levels of shrinkage within the whole supply chain.   \nCurrent approaches to categorising hot products are usually based upon perceptions of the \nsecurity department, as methods are not always in place to analyse the true nature of stock \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 13\nloss. As the recent ECR Europe data shows, retailers can only identify 41 per cent of their \nlosses and manufacturers are aware of 59 per cent of the losses they suffer11.  However, the \nstudy also found that non-food products are perceived to be most at risk of theft, particularly; \ntobacco goods, videos, CDs, DVDs, beers, wines and spirits, health and beauty products and \nelectrical goods.  These items increasingly feature within grocery stores, so the need to \ncontrol their loss may be the trigger for retailers and their suppliers to work collaboratively to \ndeal with this problem. While the concept of hot products refers mainly to items that are \nstolen, lessons learnt from closely monitoring their progress throughout the entire supply \nchain may have more generalised benefits for improving the processes used to move these, \nand all other products.  \nMeasuring the Problem  \nThe ECR Europe shrinkage study also found that currently within the FMCG sector, most \nretailers keep records of supplier fraud and process failures but few kept computerised records \nof internal and external theft, either at a company or store level.  Manufacturers were found to \nkeep computerised records of process failures but few recorded any form of theft on a \ncomputerised system.  The majority kept either no record whatsoever or only paper files12.  \nIt is only through the use of computerised databases that trends can be identified and a more \ninformation-led, systematic approach can be adopted to deal with all the elements that account \nfor shrinkage.  There are a number of fundamental measures of stock loss that are required in \norder to determine the What? How? and When? for each stock loss incident.  From a supply \nchain perspective, the following basic measures need to be collected:  \n\u2022 The level of loss in deliveries to a site \n\u2022 The level of loss from a site \n\u2022 The level of stock loss in deliveries from a site \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 14\nThese measures allow a \u2018top-level\u2019 assessment of the extent and location of stock loss across a \nsupply chain.  In addition, it is necessary to collect data on the following factors:  \n\u2022 The type of incident \n\u2022 How the incident occurred \n\u2022 When it happened \nThis data allows the nature of the type of stock losses suffered to be better understood.  The \npoints in the supply chain where these measures should be taken are shown in Figure 4.  \nInsert figure 4 about here \nIn addition to where the loss has taken place, companies need to develop systems that track \nhow and when particular incidents occur and they need to do this for all types of stock loss.  \nCompanies need to develop an approach that is systematic and part of an on-going process for \ncollecting and collating timely and useful information that describes patterns, trends and \ninformation on stock loss throughout the supply chain \u2013 from first delivery to final check out. \nStep 3: Analyse Risk, Identify Causes and Prioritise Actions \nHaving mapped and measured the current operation, this data should be analysed to \nunderstand and describe exactly what is wrong.  Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) \nis a tool for assessing the various ways that a process may fail and to determine the effect of \nthe different failure modes13.  Through focussing attention upon stock loss, and by using the \nFMEA technique, it was possible understand the: \n\u2022 Ways in which a process can fail and allow stock to be lost \n\u2022 Severity of the loss should a failure happen \n\u2022 Likelihood of a failure occurring \n\u2022 Ability to detect that a failure has occurred \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 15\nCollation of this information quantifies the risks of stock loss for the supply process as a \nwhole.  This quantification allows the risks to be ranked in order of severity and hence the key \nrisks are identified through a systematic and robust method.  \nCause and Effect Analysis  \nCause and effect analysis can be applied in two ways: \n\u2022 Reactively to analyse particular incidents of stock loss  \n\u2022 Proactively to analyse the key risks of stock loss quantified in the FMEA exercise \nCause and effect analysis benefits from a long and successful history of application in the \ninvestigation of quality problems and is fairly simple to understand and use14.  Having \nidentified specific symptoms of poor performance the cause and effect diagram, shown below \nin Figure 5, is an effective way of capturing possible contributing causes to it.  \nInsert figure 5 about here \nThis diagram is especially useful when employed to structure the outcome of a brainstorming \nsession with the project team, when they contribute their findings, experience and \nunderstanding15.  The main spines of the diagram are given broad headings around which \ncauses to the symptom of a problem are grouped however the choice of these headings is \nfairly arbitrary.   \nTo focus effort, the major causes of problems need to be identified from amongst the trivial \nmany.  This should be achieved quantitatively through the collection of data using check \nsheets to determine the number of incidents associated with each of the causes that have been \nsuggested.  However, it is possible to get the project group members to identify many of the \nmost significant problems from their experience.  In Figure 6, three causes of stock loss have \nbeen highlighted as being the most significant ones for this particular site. These are the \ncauses that will be investigated further.  \nInsert figure 6 about here. \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 16\nThis approach follows the Pareto Principle that the \u2018vital few\u2019 causes are responsible for the \nbulk of problems16.  \nFive Whys  \nInitial ideas about the causes of problems are unlikely to identify underlying root causes.  \nHaving tidied the initial ideas and focused upon the significant ones, deeper cause and effect \nstructures need to be identified.  A technique to explore underlying causes of problems, not \nthose that are first perceived, is the \u20185 whys\u2019 technique17.  This technique explores the \nunderlying causes of losses as fully as possible by repeating the question, \u2018why?\u201918  This \ntechnique is illustrated in Figure 7, below.  \nInsert figure 7 about here \nThe 5-whys technique also illustrates that the causes of loss are likely to be many and varied.  \nIn order to focus effort onto the key underlying causes, the Pareto Principle should be once \nmore applied and the vital few causes of loss highlighted from amongst the trivial many. \nIdentification and understanding of root causes concludes the diagnosis of the causes of stock \nloss and starts the \u2018remedial journey\u2019, where solutions to these problems are sought19.  \nStep 4: Develop Solutions and Prioritise Actions \nOrganisations traditionally start their stock loss reduction efforts at this, the solution stage.  It \nis not uncommon to find a great solution and then search for a problem to apply it to.  The \nsystematic process of investigation described in Steps 0 \u2013 3 of the roadmap, requires stock \nloss problems to be firstly investigated and their causes identified before the development of \nsolutions that resolve these causes and hence reduce loss.  These solutions are usually \nextremely context-specific and it is therefore not possible to simply prescribe solutions \nwithout considering the findings from the investigation work.  However, it is important to \nnote that having identified a set of appropriate solutions, these can be implemented through \none of two general approaches: clean sheet or the renovating of existing operations. \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 17\nThe clean sheet approach sets existing systems to one side and starts afresh.  This recognises \nthat current practices are beyond salvage and have no further use.  Renovating existing \nprocesses builds upon the capabilities that have underpinned the historical success of the \norganisation.  This approach requires these capabilities to have retained some value, which \nmay not be the case.   \nNew processes and systems should be accompanied by newly designed performance \nmeasurement systems.  In the same way that processes are redesigned to deliver their \nobjectives, so the performance measurement systems also need to be redesigned to monitor \nand control the new processes.  Such a system requires a suite of measures.  These must \nreflect the range of factors important to the organisation that the improvement project needs to \nenhance.  Considering them in harmony, for instance by using a \u2018Balanced Scorecard\u201920, \npromotes improvements across a broad front or at least ensures performance is maintained for \nthe basket of measures whilst driving progress in a key one.  Where performance levels \nessential to future success have been identified, but the process design that delivers them is \nnot understood, benchmarking can be a useful technique to help over come this21.  A \nbenchmarking exercise helps identify the processes used in other organisations that enable \nthem to achieve superior performance, for example by benchmarking against other hot \nproducts or items from other product categories.   \nStep 5: Implement Solutions \nIn a similar manner to the approach used to plan the project investigation, the implementation \nof the solution that will reduce stock loss requires project planning.  Successful projects \nrequire a sponsor to be responsible for delivering the benefits of the project.  To achieve \nsuccess the sponsor, usually a senior manager, needs to ensure that the project team constructs \na clear and robust business case.  This business case defines what is to be delivered, the \nbenefits this will bring and the resources required.   \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 18\nThe creation of a project plan is necessary to target resources to achieve the desired objectives \nwithin time and cost limitations.  At a top level, a project plan consists of a sequence of steps \nthat need to be undertaken.  A typical set of steps is described below:  \n\u2022 Identify the overview tasks needed to complete the project \n\u2022 Show the interrelationships between tasks and the sequence in which they can be \nundertaken on a network diagram \n\u2022 Estimate the types and amount of effort needed to complete these tasks \n\u2022 Calculate the resource profile over time to complete the project \n\u2022 Identify potential risks to successful project delivery \n\u2022 Mitigate risks or plan contingency \n\u2022 Iterate the plan to match it against resource availability \n\u2022 Secure resource \n\u2022 Put in place procedures for evaluation \nEvaluating the effectiveness of the stock loss reduction effort provides information that guides \nthe direction of the next cycle of loss reduction.  Stock loss reduction needs to be ongoing to \nensure loss reduction efforts are compatible with developments across the supply chain and to \ncounter the resourcefulness of criminals.  \nStep 6: Evaluate Implementation \nThe stock loss reduction project ends with an effective solution in place.  However, this is not \nthe end of stock loss reduction as a whole.  From the organisation\u2019s perspective, evaluation of \none project is important in order to determine the success of the solution and guide future \nprojects.  The review is therefore the last step of one project and the first step of the next.   \nThe ability to sustain significant improvements in stock loss over long periods of time rests on \nthe capability to learn from experience and to ensure that companies access the wide range of \ndeveloping tools at their disposal.  Therefore this review of the implementation must be \nobjective.  All too often reviews are undertaken with the aim of justifying the work that has \nbeen done and fail to provide an honest appraisal of what solution worked and why.  \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 19\nAccordingly, the evaluation should be rigorous, robust and led by somebody who can provide \nan objective review, independent of equipment providers and those who may have \ncommissioned the project in the first instance.  They need a clear mandate to assess the \nperformance of the implemented solution and compare this against the level of performance \noriginally planned.  This assessment should consider how the implementation of solutions \nwas justified, for example by the use of a cost\/benefit analysis.  This information provides the \nfeedback that allows the stock loss reduction team to objectively consider the effectiveness of \nthe approach the project team took to reducing stock loss and the specific solutions they \nimplemented. \nIn addition, the aim of this feedback phase is to identify whether any further action is required \nbefore the current project can be signed off and to gain a better appreciation of successful \napproaches and solutions that might be applied during future projects.  It should be noted, \nhowever, that the evaluation process may need to be ongoing as the performance of an \ninitiative can change as its \u2018environment\u2019 alters.  For instance criminals may gradually find \nways of defeating the newly adopted approach or changes in product range or levels of \nstaffing might reduce its effectiveness.  Therefore, periodic reviews of newly adopted \nmeasures may need to be carried out in order to gauge their effectiveness over time and to \nevaluate whether any corrective measures need to be taken. \nConclusion \nThe data from a plethora of studies has shown that the problem of shrinkage is massive and \ngrowing, accounting for a significant percentage of the annual turnover of companies \nthroughout the FMCG industry.  It also shows that to date most efforts to deal with the \nproblem have been piecemeal and partial, relying upon hearsay and guesswork.   \nThe stock loss reduction \u2018roadmap\u2019 is an attempt to begin to impose a greater degree of rigour \nupon the stock loss process through a more holistic and systematic methodology.  It not \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n 20\nintended to be a prescriptive solution to the problem of shrinkage.  Instead it provides a means \nof organising stock loss reduction efforts and is aimed at helping practitioners to think \nthrough and develop a more strategic approach.  Where it achieves this aim it seems clear that \nthe shrinkage reduction industry will have taken a dramatic step forward. \n \nPaul Chapman \nFigures \n \nFigure 1 The Shrinkage Road Map \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 Gillette Supply Chains to ICA, Sweden and Tesco, Hungary \n \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n22 \nFigure 3 Distribution Centre Product Flow Chart \n \n \n \nFigure 4 Points of Measurement Across the FMCG Supply Chain \n \n \n \nFigure 5 A Cause and Effect Diagram \n \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n23 \nFigure 6 Stock Loss Cause and Effect Diagram  \nwith Three Significant Causes Highlighted \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7 A \u2018Five Whys\u2019 Diagram used to Investigate the Root Causes of Effects \n \n \nTackling Shrinkage in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Supply Chain \n24 \n                                                                                                                                                        \n1  Adrian Beck is a Lecturer at the Scarman Centre, University of Leicester, email: bna@le.ac.uk; Charlotte Bilby is a Lecturer \nat the Centre for Applied Psychology, University of Leicester, email: calb1@le.ac.uk; and Dr Paul Chapman is a Senior \nResearch Fellow at the Cranfield School of Management, email: paul.chapman@cranfield.ac.uk. \n2  The term Fast Moving Consumer Goods Sector is used here to mean those retailers and their suppliers who provide a range \nof goods sold primarily through supermarkets, and hypermarkets.
