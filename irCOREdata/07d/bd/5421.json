This paper demonstrates that VLEs can help or hinder\nstudent engagement and performance, and that they should be adapted to the\ndifferent types of learner. A project is described that aimed to investigate whether\nthe introduction of a VLE can assist \u2018disengaged\u2019 students, drawing on click count\ntracking data and student performance. The project took place in the context of\ntwo very large undergraduate modules (850 and 567 students) in a Business\nSchool of a new university in the UK. In an adaptation of a model of learner\nengagement in Web-enhanced environments, four distinct learner types have\nemerged: model, traditionalist, geek and disengaged. There was evidence that use\nof the VLE exacerbated, rather than moderated, the differences between these\nlearner types.\nKeywords: virtual learning environments; e-learning; self-efficacy\nIntroduction\nThe business world is not a global village but a global technological jungle, where\nsurvival depends on the ability to use IT in new and innovative ways. (Brady, Saren, and\nTzokas 1999, 764)\nIn a mass numbers modular higher education system, students may learn rapidly that\ntheir attendance is not closely monitored nor their absence penalised. Such students\nrisk becoming \u2018disengaged\u2019, failing to participate in academic life. This is a common\ncharacteristic among the 22% of students in England who fail to complete their higher\neducation course at their original institution (House of Commons Committee of Public\nAccounts 2007).\nThe introduction of a virtual learning environment (VLE) changes the relationship\nthat a student has with their course of study. The Joint Information Systems Commit-\ntee (JISC) (2007) defines a VLE as a set of components in which learners and tutors\nparticipate in \u2018online\u2019 interactions of various kinds, including online learning. VLE\nactivity data, sometimes called click count tracking, despite its imperfections,\nprovides an easily available, yet rudimentary, measure of student \u2018learning\u2019 activity.\nAlthough such systems may support flexible study, there is a concern that they may\n*Corresponding author. Email: Alice.Maltby@uwe.ac.uk\n50  A. Maltby and S. Mackie\nalso foster a belief among those students already distanced by the system that learning\ncan be delayed to some vague future date and diminishes further the perceived need\nto attend face-to-face sessions.\nThis project seeks to establish what relationships, if any, exist between undergrad-\nuates\u2019 use of a VLE and academic achievement on two very large modules (Level 1\nOrganisation Studies, 850 students; and Level 2 Marketing, 567 students). The broader\npurpose of this is to see whether such measures can be used to identify disengaged\nstudents (Lee 2001) so that early interventions can be made that will build a stronger\nsense of self-efficacy (Bandura 1986) in an at-risk group.\nThe influences and effects of e-learning\nEffective use of new technology requires an evaluation of current pedagogy and a move\ntowards interactive and collaborative teaching and learning activities (Mason 2002;\nSalmon 2006; Stiles 2000). Failure to do so, according to Stiles (2000), could result\nin VLEs compounding the mistakes of the past, leaving the learner with a passive, unen-\ngaging experience leading to surface learning. Entwistle (2001) explains that a deep\napproach describes active engagement with the content, leading to extensive elabora-\ntion of the learning material, which contrasts with the surface approach of using routine\nmemorisation to reproduce those aspects of the subject matter expected to be assessed. \nVLEs are NOT neutral. Like any technology they embed underlying values about\nteaching and learning, promote certain affordances and reduce other choices. (Salmon\n2002, 8)\nThe concept of affordance, according to Salmon (2002, 2) means the properties of a\nsystem which allow certain actions to be performed and which encourage specific\ntypes of behaviour.\nThe affordance of publishing inherent within the commercial VLE used encourages\nstaff to use it to provide easy access to lecture slides and other teaching materials.\nHowever, Steinbronn and Merideth (2003) comment that copying and pasting lecturer\nnotes into a Web page may reproduce the material, but not the interactive communi-\ncation and engagement that can be promoted in a live lecture, with non-verbal expres-\nsion and body language. Furthermore, over-dependence on content-driven models\nresults in the same \u2018boring\u2019 material that was provided in lectures becoming boring\nWeb pages (Cronje 2001).\nWhile many academics focus on learning in relation to the use of VLEs, Selwyn\n(2000) argues that researchers need to be aware of the social, cultural, political and\neconomic aspects of educational computing; the soft as well as the hard concerns.\nAlexander (2006) develops this point, arguing that today\u2019s diverse student body\nmeans that it is important to take cultural factors in account. The implication of this is\nthat opportunities should be created to ensure that individuals and minorities are\nallowed to develop mental models within their own context. This has been described\nas the \u2018salad\u2019 model of diversity, where the richness of the mixture is seen as valuable,\ninstead of the \u2018melting pot\u2019 where uniformity is encouraged (Alexander 2006).\nIt is also important to consider the motivational, affective and cognitive factors\n(Jackson et al. 2000) that might explain why some students are more willing to use\nVLEs than others. According to Mackie and Beeby (2002), unwillingness may be due\nto anxiety or a sense that change is imposed and may detrimentally affect learning.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   51\nResistance may also be about risk adversity and an unwillingness to jettison old\n(successful) learning habits in order to try something new (Akerlind and Trevitt 1999).\nThese concerns highlight the importance of understanding students\u2019 conceptions of\nthemselves in relation to study.\nThe importance of self-efficacy in learners\nAn important element of students\u2019 self-conception, particular in relation to their clas-\nsification as being \u2018at-risk\u2019, is the concept of self-efficacy (Bandura 1986). This is seen\nas a factor in student willingness to engage with a course of study and a determinant\nof whether there is a positive relationship with achievement. Self-efficacy refers to\npeople\u2019s judgments of their capabilities to organise and execute the courses of action\nrequired to attain designated types of performances. In other words, it is the belief that\none can do a task and can transfer the learning of that task to similar tasks. Of partic-\nular importance to our project is Willis\u2019 (1993) reference to the point made by\nEntwistle and Tait (1990) that it is students\u2019 perception of their environment rather\nthan its objective reality that impacts on learning. Steinbronn and Merideth (2003) add\nthat self-efficacy supplies motivation to persist and, since motivation enhances\nproblem solving, it influences later success. When applying the concept to online\nteaching and learning they emphasise the need to design online support that should\npositively impact the psychological and physical environment of teaching and learn-\ning in an electronic area and influence the retention rate of students.\nAn individual\u2019s perceived self-efficacy, according to Houghton, Neck, and Manz\n(2003), will affect whether they are successful in performing a task. They state that\nindividuals who believe in their ability to complete a given task exert more effort and\npersist longer, thereby sustaining performance levels until success is achieved.\nMackie\u2019s (2001) study supported this view: \nCommitted students have positive, realistic expectations of university and a long germ\ngoal, they are highly motivated and determined to stay despite any difficulties. (Mackie\n2001, 270)\nHowever, the poorly committed student experiences a lack of control over events and\nfeels helpless.\nFurthermore, feelings of self-efficacy relate to student engagement of the two\ntypes as distinguished by Willis (1993): \n\u25cf institutional engagement, the integration of the student into campus life; and\n\u25cf academic engagement, connected to factors directly linked with learning.\nThis concept of engagement has become a current buzzword in today\u2019s educational\nenvironment. Kearsley and Shneiderman (1999) propose engagement theory as a\nmodel of technology-based teaching and learning. The idea underlying engagement\ntheory is that students must be meaningfully engaged in learning activities through\ninteraction with others and worthwhile tasks. Their theory posits three primary means\nto accomplish engagement: (1) an emphasis on collaborative efforts involving\ncommunication, planning, management and social skills; (2) project-based assign-\nments which make learning a creative, purposeful activity; (3) non-academic focus\ne.g. when the project has an outside customer in the community. It is proposed that\n52  A. Maltby and S. Mackie\nsuch a model of engagement pre-supposes self-efficacy, hence the focus here on this\nconcept as a means of supporting engagement.\nBuilding self-efficacy\nEarly interventions and feedback build students\u2019 notions of self-efficacy. Simpson\n(1990) described the impact of an early intervention (a phone call prior to submission\nof the first piece of assessed work) on building the confidence of at risk students in an\nonline environment. Levy\u2019s (2007) study into dropout rates found that students who\nwithdrew reported significantly lower satisfaction with e-learning than students who\nsuccessfully completed the same course. These findings have played a major role in\nthe development of the intervention processes in our own project.\nThe VLE offers opportunities for early and frequent formative feedback through\nonline assessment opportunities, and it has been argued that feedback has an impact\non the process of engagement as learning theory recognises the important function of\nfeedback. Biggs\u2019 (1999) concept of constructive alignment is also relevant, with\ndesired behaviour being shaped by formative feedback.\nWhile we have been discussing students as a homogenous entity, a study involv-\ning mass modularisation of courses must recognise the changing and diverse student\npopulation. Many authors highlight the changing attitudes and circumstances of\nstudents and how this impacts on their motivation and academic performance (e.g.\nMcInnis 2001; Kuh 1999). A study by Smart et al. (1999) discovered that in compar-\nison to undergraduates surveyed 10 years before, undergraduates of the day were\nmore bored in class, more often over-slept and missed classes or appointments and\nwere less likely to study or do homework for six or more hours a week. We need,\ntherefore, to take into account that today\u2019s students may be different to those who\nattended university before the advent of e-learning.\nOf particular interest was the finding by Smart et al. (1999) that, when examining\n\u2018at risk\u2019 students (those in poor academic standing), marketing majors were slightly\nmore likely to experience academic troubles than general students at-large. They\noffered one potential explanation for this unfavourable comparison, marketing\nstudents typically work more hours per week for money than the other students, which\nwould leave less time to study. This situation is likely to be more widespread now,\nwith the introduction of fees for study in the UK.\nWith e-learning enabling students to spend more time off campus, Morgan (2001)\nargues that students need the motivation of feeling that they are a valued member of\na learning community. He refers to the experiences of institutions that have employed\nliberal open learning practices, concluding that transferring unrestricted power to\nstudents may not be in their best interests: \nThe reality of providing unfettered freedom for the student has resulted in unacceptably\nlow completion rates. (Morgan 2001, 2)\nSalmon (2006, 8) supplies an explanation for this finding by proposing that learners\ncannot affect their own learning until they have fundamental skills and maturity.\nAs well as differentiation between students in terms of their paid work commit-\nments, other factors may also shape their experiences. Lee (2001) developed a model\nthat proposes distinctions between types of learners. The model learner scores highly\non both academic achievement and satisfaction and is a frequent user of Web-based\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   53\nlearning resources, while the maladaptive (here, \u2018disengaged\u2019) student scores low on\nboth counts and is a low user of technology. This project was interested in establishing\nwhether it can confirm any correlations between learner type, the use of technology\nand academic performance. The suspicion is that the students disengaged with the\nVLE (\u2018maladaptors\u2019) (Lee 2001) constitute the \u2018at risk\u2019 group.\nCase context\n\u2018New\u2019 universities are polytechnics, central institutions or colleges of higher educa-\ntion granted university status by the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. Student\nnumbers on modules are much greater in many of these institutions compared with\nmore traditional universities. Many practice a cross-faculty modular scheme so\nstudents interact with a great many students but may not form the more traditional\nsupport network of key peers.\nSince September 2003, the two modules considered here have used the VLE in a\nnew university. The core of learning remains face-to-face, but pre- and post-session\nlearning activities increasingly take place online \u2013 preparatory work, readings, links\nto a wide range of resources, advice, formative assessment and revision. It is valued\nby staff as a \u2018one-to-many\u2019 electronic notice board and filing cabinet; an easy-to-update\nmechanism for course content distribution; and as a portal to a wide range of internal\nand external resources that blurs the boundaries of the module.\nMethodology\nA key part of the literature which informed the research design of the present study\nwas the importance of early interventions and feedback in building students\u2019 notions\nof self-efficacy. Of particular relevance was Simpson\u2019s (1990) description of the\nimpact of early interventions in building the confidence of at risk students in an online\nenvironment.\nThe objectives were to investigate the following questions: \n\u25cf What does the tracking data reveal about the online learning behaviours of\nstudents?\n\u25cf Is there any relationship between level of use, as measured by tracking data, and\nstudent performance?\n\u25cf Is the relationship the same for all forms of assessment and at all times of the\nacademic year?\nIt should be stated at the outset that, for ethical reasons, it was impossible to have a\ncontrol group for comparison that would not be exposed to the modules\u2019 VLE. Track-\ning statistics indicating the amount of student access to the system were recorded at\nseveral points throughout the year and the non-users and low users were contacted\npersonally by module leaders. At the beginning of the academic year, straightforward\ninduction tasks linked to the use of the VLE were incorporated on the website to\nemphasise the importance of early and frequent use.\nThe key monitoring and intervention points during the investigation were: \n(1) Induction tasks linked to use of the VLE to emphasise the importance of early\nuse.\n54  A. Maltby and S. Mackie\n(2) Monitoring point one at end of October. Tracking statistics taken of number of\ntimes students accessed the VLE. A first email was sent to all non-users and\nlow users to remove any technical or personal barriers to use and to promote\nbeliefs of self-efficacy.\n(3) Monitoring point two (a) March. Tracking data were recorded. An email plus\nquestionnaire were sent to low and non users.\n(4) Monitoring point two (b) April. Letter plus questionnaire were sent 22 April\nto those who had not replied to the email.\n(5) Overall summaries of course usage were calculated for \u2013 October, term 1, term\n2, and overall usage.\n(6) End of year Field board reports were analysed \u2013 marks for the coursework\ncomponent, examination component and overall module were noted, plus the\npass\/fail outcome.\nIs VLE tracking ethical?\nAll research activities need to take ethical issues into account but the use of VLE\ntracking data in this project highlights particularly complex issues. The surveillance\ntools within VLEs enable lecturers and management to generate records for each\nuser indicating their level of accesses to the module, which particular areas they\naccess and the time of day or, more surprisingly, time of night at which they\naccess resources (Maltby and Mackie 2003). Land and Bayne (2002) stated that\nthese tools are far more than the electronic equivalent of the attendance sheet since\nthey provide intimate details of every student\u2019s working hours and patterns of\nstudy.\nCyber-surveillance theory, building on the panopticon metaphor highlights the\nneed to understand how the virtual environment works. (The panopticon was a prison\ndesign created by Jeremy Bentham in 1785, where prisoners were able to observed at\nall times without seeing the observers (Bentham 1962; Foucault 1979)). \nOur chances of developing effective pedagogies for online learning will be greatly\nenhanced if we are prepared to recognise and work with the new modes of identity\nformation and new articulation of power\/knowledge that cyberspace technologies\nrepresent. (Land and Bayne 2002, 137)\nFurther research needs to be conducted on how students feel about these ethical issues\nof surveillance. Results may confirm Schlossberg and Cebrzyninski\u2019s (1993) observa-\ntion that most people believed that they had already lost the right to control their\npersonal information because new technologies and large databases facilitate the\nincreasingly effective use of information about consumers and citizens. However, a\nrecent study by Dawson (2006) revealed that surveyed students indicated that their\nonline behaviour was influenced by the degree to which they perceived it to be\nsurveyed by both the institution and teaching staff, suggesting that it remains an issue\nfor students.\nIn our study, all the students on the two modules appeared in the tracking data.\nThey were advised that their online behaviour would be monitored and that they were\nunable to opt out of the process. Where individual students were contacted by the\nmodule leaders their anonymity was protected in the research findings (and this was\nmade clear to them).\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   55\nFindings\nFirstly, the relationship between tracking and performance data is presented for the two\nmodules. This is followed by the findings suggesting the importance of early monitoring.\nThirdly, we discuss the group of students who prefer traditional face to face teaching.\nAn overview of student use\nFirstly, we were interested in knowing whether there were any particular patterns in\nstudent use or examples of optimum usage.\nThe range of student use is highly variable, throughout the year (September to\nMay). For Organisation Studies level 1 students the average number of clicks per\nstudent was 189, but the range is from 0 to 1432. However, for Marketing level 2\nstudents, the average per student is higher, 222, and the range is wider from 0 to 2429.\nThe relationship between tracking and performance data\nThis is a key part of the project as it indicates whether there is any relationship\nbetween assessment performance and the use of the VLE.\nFor Organisation Studies Level 1 there was a steady increase in assessment perfor-\nmance in relation to the amount of times students accessed the VLE. Figure 1 shows\nTotal tracking into five groups\n385 to 1432 clicks\n223 to 384 clicks\n87 to 222 clicks\n33 to 86 clicks\n0 to 32 clicks\nM\nea\nn \nof\n o\nve\nra\nll \nm\nod\nul\ne \nm\nar\nk\n60\n50\n40\n30\nFigure 1.

Correlation between online behaviour and assessment performance (MOB students).However, the results for Marketing Year 2 students were not as straightforward.\nThere seemed to be an optimum level of use i.e. between 277 and 437 clicks when\nstudents achieved a mean of 52%. Figure 2 shows that those students registering more\nthan 440 clicks dropped slightly to 50%.\nFigure 2. Correlation between online behaviour and assessment performance (Marketing).\nCan tracking data predict performance and identifying \u2018at risk\u2019 students?\nThe literature suggested the value of identifying \u2018at risk\u2019 students early on in the\nacademic year.\nFigure 3. The value of early tracking data for MOB students.The results demonstrate that the online behaviour patterns of potentially \u2018at risk\u2019\nstudents are formed surprisingly early in their university life. The Organisation\nStudies Level 1 findings reveal that by the end of October, 10% of students were not\nenrolled as users of the VLE and 20% of students had not yet used the VLE. These\nstudents performed less well (at 39% or 40% overall module mark) than students with\nhigher use patterns at that stage (56% overall module mark). Despite interventions in\nOctober to the Organisation Studies students, non-users\/low performers failed to\nchange their early online learning intentions. The Marketing Year 2 results did not\nshow such clear differences.\nWe must also take into account the responses to a questionnaire sent to non- and\nlow users which revealed a group (\u2018the traditionalists\u2019) who were still engaged as they\nrespond to emails\/letters and were not \u2018lost\u2019 to the system, yet these students found\nTracking total five gps\n440+277-437114-27630-1130-29\nM\nea\nn \nof\n o\nve\nra\nll \nm\nod\nul\ne\n54\n52\n50\n48\n46\n44\n42\n40\nFigure 2.

One confounding variable is the fact that\nsome students accessed the VLE using their password on their friend\u2019s behalf to\ndownload lecture slides etc. Since for ethical reasons, it is impossible to have a control\ngroup, for comparison purposes, who have no access to the e-learning environment,\nwe have no way of knowing whether use of the VLE improves students\u2019 performance\noverall.\nAnother possible issue relates to the finding by Smart et al. (1999) that marketing\nstudents typically work more hours per week for money than other students, which\nwould leave them with less time for study. We could suggest that since students in\nthis position are away from the university more, they need to use the VLE to make\nOctober tracking in five groups\n143 to 743 clicks66 to 1422 to 65 clickszero usenot on system\nM\nea\nn \nof\n o\nve\nra\nll \nm\nod\nul\ne \nm\nar\nk\n60\n50\n40\n30\nFigure 3.

However, the opposite may be\nthe reality, possibly because according to Morgan (2001), transferring unrestricted\npower to students may not be in their best interests. Similarly, Salmon (2006)\nsuggests that learners cannot affect their own learning until they have fundamental\nskills and maturity.\nThere is no doubt that the analysis of the project\u2019s findings could have been much\nricher if the researchers had been able to interview the \u2018non-participating\u2019 students but\nsince they did not respond to any form of communication, or attend classes, they were\nimpossible to reach. Mackie and Beeby (2002) suggest that unwillingness to use VLEs\nmay be caused by anxiety. Similarly, Akerlind and Trevitt (1999) refer to risk\nadversity as being a potential factor. Solely using tracking statistics cannot illuminate\nthese issues.\nRelationship between tracking and performance data\nThese results were not straightforward and showed further discrepancies between the\ntwo modules. While the Organisation Studies results showed a positive correlation\nbetween the amount of VLE access and assessment performance, the Marketing\nresults were more complicated. The optimum level of access was between 277 and\n437 clicks. Increased access showed a detrimental effect on assessment performance.\nAn interesting explanation is proposed by Mason (2002, 7), who suggests: \nThe flexibility of the medium easily leads learners to allow other priorities to come\nbefore logging on to the course or group work. The much vaunted interactivity easily\nleads to overload. The ability to jump from one resource to the next on the Web (i.e.\nhypertext) can be over-used so that relatedness becomes an end in itself, and meaning\nis lost.\nMany other factors identified in the literature review could enrich the findings with\nfurther research. These include the social, cultural, political and economic aspects of\neducational computing (Selwyn 2000; Alexander 2006); the motivational, affective\nand cognitive factors (Jackson et al. 2000); and students\u2019 prior knowledge (Corredor\n2006).\nThe importance of self-efficacy in learners\nThe rationale for this research was to use the VLE as an aid for identifying students\nwho can be deemed \u2018at risk\u2019. It had been assumed that early intervention would be\nimportant for some students in their first year. However, in contrast to this assumption,\nit was found that patterns of online learning appear to be fixed early on in students\u2019\nuniversity careers. Despite the email interventions in October to the Organisation\nStudies students, non users\/low performers failed to change their early online learning\nintentions.\nWe have already defined self-efficacy as a factor in student willingness to engage\nwith a course of study and in having a positive relationship with student achievement.\nOur results highlight the need to investigate further those students whose behaviour in\nthe first October defines their university career. In particular, we need to study those\nfactors highlighted by Selwyn (2000), Alexander (2006), Jackson et al. (2000) and\nCorredor (2006).\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   59\nThe benefits and risks of online surveillance\nWe have reported that the results demonstrate the importance of monitoring early\nonline behaviour to be able to identify possible \u2018at-risk\u2019 students, which supports the\nfindings of Simpson (1990). Similarly, Morris, Finnegan and Wu (2005) demonstrated\nthe relationship between online user-behaviour and academic performance. The\nemployment of online surveillance thus enables the identification of students who may\nrequire additional scaffolding.\nThis complicates the ethical situation, since surveillance may be in the students\u2019\nbest interests \u2013 it could be considered unethical for a tutor not to attend to students\u2019\nbehaviour in this way. However, we must question the reasons and usage of online\nsurveillance. An ongoing discussion in the academic community centres on how we\ncan encourage independent learners who engage in deep learning (e.g. Entwistle 2001).\nFurther research needs to be conducted into whether by monitoring and intervening\nwe may be unintentionally encouraging surface learning and more student dependence.\nLee\u2019s model of learner engagement in Web-enhanced environments\nWe have used this model to validate our own research findings. Lee\u2019s (2001) model\nsuggests the emergence of four distinct learner types, shown in Figure 4, each with a\ndifferent combination of levels of use and academic performance:\nFigure 4. Adaptation of Lee\u2019s (2001) model of learner engagement in Web-enhanced environments.\nModel students\nHigh use and high performance. Students\u2019 expectations of the VLE are in line with\ntutor intentions (i.e. the VLE as Web-enhanced learning). These students understand\nwhat is expected of them and therefore learn appropriately as they make best use of\nall of the resources and learning opportunities available to them.\nTraditionalists\nLow use and high performance. These students favour face-to-face and print-based\nlearning. They are clear about this preference and learn appropriately from it. This\ngroup also objects to correspondence that implies a link between their lack of use of\nthe VLE and poor motivation and performance. As the core of the learning is still face-\nto-face for both modules they are not significantly disadvantaged by their low use of\nthe VLE as they are part of the learning community. This group would, however, be\ndisadvantaged by any move along the blended learning continuum towards a distance\nlearning model.\nGeeks\nHigh use and low performance. There is a mismatch between student and tutor inten-\ntions for the VLE. Geeks may interpret the VLE as a distance learning course or simply\nbe motivated by the technology rather than the course content or learning activities.\nThe disengaged\nLow performance and low use of the VLE. Ma\u00f1ana learners (and tomorrow never\ncomes). For reasons not understood at present, by the end of October this group has\n60  A. Maltby and S. Mackie\nstarted on a downward spiral of non attendance. They start off badly and never recover\nand increasingly operate at the periphery of the organisation. They learn inappropriately\nand fail at assessment points as they do not access the information available to them\nabout how to succeed.\nWhile some of our findings concur with Lee\u2019s groupings, further investigation\nneeds to take place into the comparison of online behaviour statistics, face-to-face\nattendance patterns and assessment performance.\nConclusions\nThis paper aimed to investigate whether VLEs help or hinder student engagement\nand performance. It compared and analysed click count tracking data with student\nassessment grades on large Level 1 and Level 2 modules. The ultimate aim was to\nassess whether VLE tracking could identify the \u2018disengaged\u2019 student allowing the\nopportunity for staff interventions to help rectify the situation.\nTracking data revealed that students varied greatly in the amount that they access\nthe VLE. At best, as witnessed by \u2018model\u2019 learners, the VLE promotes a positive\nlearning climate and thereby student engagement as students benefit from flexibility\nand access to a wider range of resources and \u2018Martini\u2019 (anytime, any place, anywhere)\n\u2018just in time\u2019 learning.\nAt worst, as witnessed by \u2018disengaged\u2019 learners, the VLE promotes a negative\nlearning climate and thereby student disengagement in that when used inappropriately\nit may encourage \u2018Ma\u00f1ana\u2019 learning, a sense that learning does not have to be\ncaptured in the moment and can be put off to some vague future date.\nAt this stage the learner typology is only tentative and requires further testing\nand development, most specifically with regards to the most problematic non-user\/\npoor performer disengaged group.
