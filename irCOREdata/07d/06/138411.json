This paper explores the challenges for\nmanagement development that arise as organisations seek to bridge the gap between current\ncapabilities and those required for future success. The results of an exploratory research\nprogramme are summarised and, drawing on these findings, a tentative skills profile for the\nlogistics and supply chain manager of the future is advanced.\nA key feature of the current business environment is the idea that supply chains compete, not\ncompanies (Christopher, 1992). Managing supply chains effectively is a complex and\nchallenging task, as a result of the continuing trends of expanding product variety, short\nproduct life cycles, increased outsourcing, globalization of businesses, and continuous\nadvances in information technology (Lee, 2002). In recent years supply chain management\n(SCM) has grown in acceptance: \u2018\u2026 the area that was once considered to be only of minor\nconcern to managers is now at the forefront of business planning. The discipline that had a\ndifficult time getting the attention of senior managers in firms now has representatives in the\ntop echelons of most organisations\u2019 (Lancioni, 2000). In this milieu, logistics managers and\nsupply chain managers play a pivotal role in ensuring continued firm competitiveness and\nsuccess. This paper is concerned with both logistics managers and supply chain managers.\nDefinitional, and practical, differences exist between logistics and supply chain management,\nand while the terms are often used interchangeably, they are distinct (Cooper et.al, 1997).\nLogistics can be defined as the planning and management of physical and information flows\nthrough an organisation, whereas supply chain management extends this concept into the\nwider network of the organisations suppliers and customers. As such, supply chain managers\nnot only need to be equipped with the skills and knowledge to manage logistics but also they\nmust be relationship managers.\nWhilst recognising that logistics and supply chain management can be, and often are,\nmanaged separately we argue that at this early stage in the acceptance and implementation of\nthese ideas the reality is that they tend to be managed conjointly. For this reason we will use\nthe label \u2018supply chain manager\u2019 as a generic descriptor.\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 16, No. 2, pp.178-191, 2005\n2\nTHE CURRENT CHARACTERISTICS AND ROLE OF SUPPLY CHAIN\nMANAGERS\nCurrently supply chain managers are a quite varied group and to an extent reflect the\ndisparate origins of the subject in terms of their functional background - they often come into\na logistics \/ supply chain role from other areas such as transportation, procurement, IT,\nfinance, etc. Indeed it is only in recent years, with the advent of focused undergraduate\ncourses in logistics and SCM, that people are coming into the logistics \/ SCM function\ndirectly from University. The annual survey of logistics managers and directors in the US\ncarried out by the Supply Chain Management Research Group at the Ohio State University\n(LaLonde and Ginter, 2004) gives an insight into the characteristics of the typical supply\nchain manager; respondents to their 2004 survey were: 93.5% male, 6.5% female; median age\nfor logistics directors was 43 and for managers was 39; of the survey respondents 89% had a\nbaccalaureate degree, 63% had a masters degree and 18% had professional qualifications (for\nexample APICS); for the respondents who were logistics managers average time worked in\nlogistics was 18.5 years, time with current firm 4.2 years and time in current position 3.7\nyears. Similar profiles were obtained in a survey of Australian logistics managers by Sohal\nand D'Netto (2004): 62.5% of their survey respondents were aged between 35 and 49, 76%\nhad a higher degree or diploma, and 63% had worked in the logistics function for over 10\nyears. While these data are not necessarily typical of supply chain managers everywhere,\nthey are nonetheless indicative of general perceptions of the sector which are that females are\nunder-represented, people work within the function for many years, and rotate jobs relatively\nfrequently.\nIn recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the critical role played by people,\nknowledge and talent in the context of supply chain success. In a panel discussion with seven\nof the leading thinkers in the field of supply chain management, the issue of management\ntalent came to the fore: \u2018despite years of process breakthroughs and elegant technology\nsolutions, an agile, adaptive supply chain remains an elusive goal. Maybe it\u2019s the people who\nare getting in the way \u2026.. supply chains, it seems are really about talent, not technology,\nespecially as the marketplace grows ever more complex\u2019 (Kirby, 2003). Similarly, van Hoek\net al (2002) describe managers in the supply chain as 'the critical dimension'. On an\nanecdotal level, we recently heard a bank manager point out in a presentation to managers\nfrom various medium-sized logistics companies that in his view three factors were of utmost\nimportance for the success of these companies: management, management and management !\nQuinn (2004) suggests that to achieve any measure of supply chain success, three critical\nelements (people, process and technology) need to be kept in balance. He adds that there is\nno single answer as to which of these three is the most important to supply chain success,\nalthough he does add that 'you can't do anything without the right people'. Research by\nLangabeer and Seifert (2003) has pointed to the critical role played by supply chain managers\nin ensuring the success of intercompany mergers; they show that a correlation exists between\nmerger success and how well integrated the supply chains are, and this in turn is dependent\nupon the role played by supply chain managers.\nSKILLS AND COMPETENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR SUPPLY CHAIN\nMANAGERS\nMurphy and Poist (1991, 1994) suggested that the senior-level logistics manager needs to be\nproficient in three skills categories namely: business skills, logistics skills and management\nskills. In their survey of executive search firms, logistics practitioners and logistics\neducators, management skills emerged as the most important of the three categories, followed\nby logistics skills and then business skills. Gammelgaard and Larson (2001) posited a three-\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 16, No. 2, pp.178-191, 2005\n3\nfactor model of SCM skill areas for executive development and other programmes aimed at\nlogistics managers: interpersonal\/managerial basic skills, quantitative\/technological skills,\nand SCM core skills. They also stressed the importance of good communications skills for\ntoday\u2019s logisticians, both upward and downwards communication within the organisation, as\nwell as being able to communicate across functions and organisations so as to coordinate\nSCM. The consensus view across studies of supply chain managers would appear to be that\nrespondents regard themselves as 'managers first and logisticians second' with requisite skills\nand competencies sets that comprise both general management skills and competencies and\nspecific logistics \/ supply chain skills and competencies (see, for example, Mangan et al,\n2001).\nSupply chain management implies a \u2018horizontal\u2019 organisational orientation rather than a\n\u2018vertical\u2019 one. Traditional businesses are organised on functional lines with strong\nhierarchical underpinnings. The managers who work in those types of business have\ntypically been trained and\/or gained experience in very specific areas such as marketing,\nproduction management, accountancy, etc. They will move upwards through the hierarchy as\nthey demonstrate increasing capability in that narrow functional area.\nThe performance measurement systems that are frequently used in these organisations mirror\nthe vertical structure, i.e. they monitor progress towards the achievement of functional goals.\nBy contrast, in the \u2018horizontal\u2019 organisation, managers work across functions often as part of\nteams where different functional skills are brought together with a common process focus.\nBecause business processes are the means by which customer value is created in any\nbusiness, there is a strong logic in arguing that process management rather than functional\nmanagement should be the basis for organisational design.\nTo enable \u2018horizontal\u2019 or process-focused management to become a reality, clearly requires\nappropriate skill sets amongst managers. The implication is that the management\ndevelopment process must focus on a holistic view of the way in which customer value is\ncreated and delivered. This in turn suggests the need to develop an awareness of how the\ninterface in a supply chain needs to be managed and how actions taken in one area might\naffect the performance of the whole. Thus, the need for a greater level of \u2018cross-training\u2019\nacross functional boundaries to ensure that the whole becomes more than the sum of its parts.\nThe implication of this re-orientation is that the supply chain manager of the future will\nrequire a \u2018T-shaped\u2019 skills profile (see Figure 1).\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 16, No. 2, pp.178-191, 2005\n4\nFigure 1 \u2013 Skills Profile\nThe idea is that as well as bringing specific logistics management skills to the job (the\nvertical bar) supply chain managers need to have a wide understanding of related areas such\nas for example business process engineering, asset management and activity based costing\n(the horizontal bar).\nRecently Christopher (2004) identified seven major business transformations which will have\nsignificant implications for supply chain management skills profiles. In his presentation\n(Table 1), Christopher mapped each of these seven business transformations against both\ntheir direct impact on the supply chain and the skills which would as a result be required.\nBusiness\nTransformation:\nLeading to: Skills required:\n1. From supplier-centric to\ncustomer-centric\nThe design of\ncustomer-driven\nsupply chains\nMarket understanding; customer\ninsight\n2. From push to pull Higher levels of\nagility and flexibility\nManagement of complexity and\nchange\n3. From inventory to\ninformation\nCapturing and sharing\ninformation on real\ndemand\nInformation systems and\ninformation technology expertise\n4. From transactions to\nrelationships\nFocus on service and\nresponsiveness as the\nbasis for customer\nretention\nAbility to define, measure and\nmanage service requirements by\nmarket segment\n5. From \u2018trucks and sheds\u2019\nto end-to end pipeline\nmanagement\nA wider definition of\nsupply chain cost\nUnderstanding of the \u2018cost-to-\nserve\u2019 and time-based\nperformance indicators\n6. From functions to\nprocesses\nThe creation of cross\nfunctional teams\nfocussed on value\ncreation\nSpecific functional excellence\nwith cross-functional\nunderstanding. Team working\ncapabilities\n7. From stand alone More collaborative Relationship management and\nEffective process management requires significant\ncross-functional skills.\nCreating the \u2018T-shaped\u2019 skills profile:-\nManagers have in-depth\nexpertise in one discipline\ncombined with enough\nbreadth to see the\nconnections with others\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 16, No. 2, pp.178-191, 2005\n5\ncompetition to\nnetwork rivalry\nworking with supply\nchain partners\nwin-win orientation\nTable 1 The key business transformations and the implications for management skills\n(Christopher, 2004)\nChristopher's framework again comprises both management skills and competencies and\nlogistics \/ supply chain management skills and competencies. These skills requirements for\nfuture supply chain managers are wide and varied (perhaps more so than might be the case\nwith other categories of managers), with an emphasis in particular on what could be\ndescribed as interpersonal and communications skills.\nDEVELOPING THE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGER OF THE FUTURE\nGiven the emerging profile of the various roles, skills and competencies of supply chain\nmanagers, the question arises as to how best can these managers be developed? Bowersox et\nal (2000) identified a requisite shift from training to knowledge-based learning as one of the\nten mega-trends that will revolutionize supply chain logistics. The concept of the learning\norganisation, popularised by Senge (1990) and Pedlar et al (1991), is now well established.\nBessant et al (2003) take the concept a stage further and consider learning across entire\nsupply chains - given that organisations can and do learn, they suggest that further benefits\ncan accrue from learning among the wider entity of the supply chain. Ellinger et al (2002)\nsummarise that the overall premise of the learning organisation concept is that the firm can\nimprove performance by developing the learning skills and harnessing the knowledge of its\nemployees. Regrettably, however, their research in the US suggests that logistics\norganisations may not be the best examples of learning organisations and stand accused of\nhaving placed far less of an emphasis on the growth and development of personnel than on\noperational efficiency and improving customer relations. This point is echoed by Easterby-\nSmith (1997) who noted that within the production management discipline the dominant\nontology is around the link between learning and organisational productivity \/ efficiency.\nIn terms of provision, many countries now provide a range of development activities for\nsupply chain managers. Many of these activities take place around the professional bodies,\nexamples of which include the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals\n(www.cscmp.org) and the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in the UK\n(www.ciltuk.org.uk). In addition, the tertiary education sector provides a range of courses\nand qualifications, ranging from vocational qualifications and executive education\nprogrammes to undergraduate and postgraduate degree level qualifications. A more recent\ndevelopment has been the emergence of publicly funded, regional centres of excellence for\nthe development of skills levels and management capabilities in logistics and SCM. This\ndovetails with the increased recognition being given by many public policy makers to\nmanagement capability and management development generally. Three examples of such\ndevelopments are: The Logistics Institute\u2013Asia Pacific (TLI-AP), a joint venture between the\nSingapore government, the National University of Singapore and Georgia Institute of\nTechnology in the US (Box 1); the MIT - Zaragoza International Logistics Programme in\nSpain (Box 2); and the recently established University Of Hull Logistics Institute (Box 3).\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 16, No. 2, pp.178-191, 2005\n6\nBox 1\nThe Logistics Institute\u2013Asia Pacific (TLI-AP) (www.tliap.nus.edu.sg)\nTLI-AP has as its mission to be the premier institute in Asia Pacific nurturing logistics\nexcellence in research and education. Located at the National University of Singapore, the\ninstitute is modelled after The Logistics Institute (TLI) at Georgia Institute of Technology in\nthe US. TLI has four major programmes:\n\uf0b7 A comprehensive global logistics and supply chain research programme\n\uf0b7 A dual masters degree programme in logistics and SCM\n\uf0b7 A logistics executive education programme\n\uf0b7 Industry outreach programmes: Leaders in Logistics, Market Research Centre, Centre of\nCompetence (COC) in Optimisation.\nBox 2\nThe MIT - Zaragoza International Logistics Programme in Spain\n(web.mit.edu\/zlc)\nThe MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Programme is a research and education\npartnership between MIT, the University of Zaragoza, industry, and the government of\nArag\u00f3n in Spain. The programme combines resources from the MIT Center for\nTransportation and Logistics and the Zaragoza Logistics Center (ZLC), a research institute\nassociated with the University of Zaragoza. ZLC is based in PLAZA, reportedly the largest\nlogistics park in Europe, which is currently being built in Zaragoza, and which offers faculty\nand students direct access to a concentration of logistics activity and state-of-the-art\ntechnology\nBox 3\nThe Logistics Institute at the University of Hull\n(www.hull.ac.uk\/hubs\/logistics)\nFunded from a mix of European Union, UK Government and University funds, a Logistics\nInstitute is currently being established at the University of Hull which is located in the\nHumber region on the east coast of England. This region comprises the largest ports\nconurbation in the UK and is an important node for trade with Northern Europe, especially\ngiven the increasing congestion in the southern part of the UK. Set to employ over 30 full-\ntime staff, plus additional part-time staff and contract consultants, the institute will provide a\nrange of degree programmes, short courses and consultancy services. It will also have a\nresource centre and technology demonstration area to help practitioners stay abreast of the\nlatest developments in logistics.\nThere is little data available with regard to the types, quantities and effectiveness of training\nand development undertaken by logistics and supply chain managers. Mangan et al (2001)\nshowed that the most common types of training received by their sample of logistics\nmanagers were (in decreasing order of frequency): formal college, in-house training, seminar\n\/ workshop, \u2018on the job\u2019, and in-house training with an external trainer. In terms of skills and\ncompetencies, Gammelgaard and Larson (2001) note that skills are general tools and rules\ntaught in most logistics classes, whereas to reach competence level in the logistics discipline\nthey suggest that practitioners acquire context-dependent knowledge through organisational\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 16, No. 2, pp.178-191, 2005\n7\nexperience, thus highlighting the importance of relevant on-the-job experience. A criticism\nof much logistics and SCM education is that there is often too much emphasis on the\ntechnical aspects of the role, to the detriment of the other elements (see, for example, van\nHoek et al, 2002).\nA variety of teaching modes are generally employed in logistics \/ SCM education and\ndevelopment. These modes include those generally employed elsewhere such as lectures and\nguest presentations. Given the nature of the subject, site visits to logistics facilities such as\nwarehouses etc. are common and generally found to be very beneficial by participants.\nFrequent use is also made of computer based training, group exercises and simulations. One\nof the most popular such simulations used in logistics and SCM is the 'Beer Game' which is\nused to introduce students to the challenges of managing supply chains (Sparling, 2003). The\ngame was originally developed at MIT and is based on the systems dynamics work of\nForrester (1958) at that university in the 1950s. Many variants of this game are now in use.\nAs regards degree programmes in SCM, Handfield (2004) noted that providers need to ensure\nthe provision of fully integrated SCM programmes that take account of the integration-\noriented skills required of successful graduates. With regard to university provision of SCM\neducation, there is some evidence of differences in the pedagogical perspective of individual\nuniversities. This is perhaps understandable when considered in light of the evolution of\nlogistics and SCM, with different universities perhaps reflecting the varying origins of the\nsubject. At MIT in the US, for example, a university renowned for its emphasis on science,\nengineering and technology, the focus is very much on 'engineering the supply chain'\n(Caplice et al, 2004) with an emphasis on teaching both analytical skills and management\nskills. At Erasmus University in the Netherlands, in contrast, the focus in logistics \/ SCM\nteaching is very much on economics and econometric skills. Other examples include\nCranfield University in the UK which has developed the marketing aspects of logistics and\nSCM and more recently has pioneered the agile supply chain concept, while Cardiff\nUniversity in the UK has pioneered the concept of lean logistics, particularly as a result of its\nwork in the automobile sector.\nIn a survey of senior logistics managers' views on developing valuable logistics managers\n(i.e. their subordinates), Myers et al (2004) showed that neither job experience nor education\nlevel were found to be directly related to employee performance, but that various job skills\n(such as decision-making and problem-solving skills) appear to be good predictors of\nemployee performance. They caution however not to discount education and experience as\nthese may represent minimum or threshold level requirements in order to function as logistics\nmanagers. Myers et al (2004) conclude that while in the past most education in the US\nemphasised book knowledge, a re-evaluation is needed to determine the appropriate blend of\nsoft and hard skills.\nRESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nThere were three constituencies of interest in the context of the current research programme\nwhich aimed to investigate the knowledge areas, skills and competencies required by supply\nchain managers and the preferred approaches for the development of these managers. The\nthree constituencies were:\n- Providers: academics and management developers engaged in the development of supply\nchain managers;\n- Users: students (in the case of graduate programmes) and participants (in the case of\nexecutive programmes) who partake in such development;\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 16, No. 2, pp.178-191, 2005\n8\n- Buyers: corporates who pay for such development.\nGiven the nature of the subject matter, it was deemed essential as far as was practicable to\nascertain views from actors in each of these three constituencies. A triangulated research\napproach (Easterby-Smith et al, 1991 and Hussey and Hussey, 1997) was employed.\nInterviews were conducted with three leading academics and management developers from\nthe US, the UK and the Netherlands. Ten further responses were elicited via a survey of\nother (carefully selected) academics and management developers from Europe and Asia. A\nsurvey was conducted of recent graduates from the #1 ranked masters degree programme in\nlogistics \/ SCM in the US and a total of 26 usable responses were received. The views of\nparticipants on executive education programmes were obtained both via a focus group (10\nparticipants) and a survey (23 usable responses) of executives working for both multinational\nand indigenous firms in Ireland and who are either currently engaged in, or have recently\ncompleted, a management development programme for logistics \/ supply chain managers.\nFinally, the 'buyers' constituency was represented via interviews with executives responsible\nfor management development in the logistics \/ supply chain area at one of the world's leading\npharmaceutical companies (Glaxosmithkline). Discussions were also held with a number of\nother multinational companies, however for a variety of reasons it was not possible to elicit\nfrom these companies valid data for this research effort.\nRESULTS & DISCUSSION\nTable 2 outlines some of the key themes which emerged from the interviews with providers,\nwhile Tables 3 and 4 illustrate some inter-group comparisons. In addition, Box 4 discusses\nthe issues which arise in the context of the case study company (Glaxosmithkline).\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 16, No. 2, pp.178-191, 2005\n9\nTheme Specific Issues\nSpecific logistics\ncompetencies are required\nfor emerging markets.\nAs countries such as India and China develop, one of\nthe key challenges will be how to 'manage' logistics\nwithin these large countries. Similarly, supply chain\nmanagers from these countries will focus on different\nareas (such as trade regulations and international\ntransport) to their counterparts from developed\ncountries.\nCourses need to be more\npractical.\nOften there can be an overemphasis on academic\ncontent to the detriment of practical content. In\naddition, other areas need to be added to syllabi such\nas, for example, leadership.\nMultimodal nature of\nlogistics and SCM needs to\nbe highlighted more.\nGrowing international trade combined with\nenvironmental and other issues impacting particular\ntransport modes is leading to the growing use of\nmultimodal transport with which supply chain\nmanagers will need to be familiar.\nNeed to differentiate\nbetween different learners.\nLearning needs of those new to the function versus\nthose with experience within the function will differ.\nSimilarly learning capabilities of supply chain\nmanagers range from those with too narrow a\nperspective to those with an ability to both reflect and\nthink strategically.\nFocus on processes and\nflows.\nAvoid encouraging a mentality that focuses only on\nspecific sectors or functions ('silos').\nIn-class exercises. In-class exercises which can last up to half a day can be\nespecially useful particularly if they are properly\nsequenced and structured into a course.\nBest practice exists within\ncertain companies.\nLimited, but highly insightful, examples of best\npractice logistics and supply chain management\ndevelopment exist within particular companies.\nTable 2 Key themes from the interviews with providers\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 16, No. 2, pp.178-191, 2005\n10\nBox 4\nLogistics \/ Supply Chain Management Development at Glaxosmithkline\nGlaxosmithkline (GSK) is one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies with an\nestimated 7% of the world's pharmaceutical market. With over 100,000 employees\nworldwide, the company had sales of $35.2 billion and profit before tax of $11 billion in\n2003. Of the company's 100,000 employees, over 40,000 are in sales and marketing (the\nlargest sales force in the industry), while around 35,000 work in manufacturing (across 85\nsites in 37 countries).\nGlaxosmithkline believe that they are at the forefront of logistics and supply chain\nmanagement education. Two years ago they established an 'Academy of Logistics' which is\nrun from both their UK (Global HQ) and US sites. The focus of the Academy is very much\non blended learning and it comprises a raft of online courses on various different aspects of\nlogistics and SCM. These are supplemented by face to face classes, fora with external\nspeakers and live webcasts, best practice alerts and a company focused online simulation.\nTopics covered are both of a general nature (e.g. key principles of different aspects of SCM)\nand also specifically business related (e.g. demonstrations of new production protocols,\ndissemination of company policies and procedures, etc.). The portals and various online\ncomponents of the Academy are very clearly presented, easily navigated and allow for\nregular and focused self-assessment by users. Usage of the Academy can be incorporated\ninto participants\u2019 personal development plans and there is also an assessment capability\nwhich can chart participant progress. Users' managers can also access the system and chart\ntheir subordinates\u2019 progress.\nGoing forward, the company sees two key areas for development with regard to the\nAcademy. The first concerns partnering with an expert logistics \/ supply chain organisation\n(university \/ consultancy \/ other) with a view to advanced studies (e.g. a company focused\nand blended masters programme in logistics \/ SCM). The second area concerns knowledge\nmanagement. What the company would like to achieve is to move beyond mere knowledge\nsharing (which they regard as a somewhat passive role) to a more proactive role whereby\nonce best practice is identified it is actively placed into the system. Following on from this,\nusage of, and benefits from, such best practice could be measured.\nBarriers and difficulties identified to current usage of the Academy include: timezone\ndifferences, internet and intranet access and speed for users, users\u2019 ability to block off in-\ncompany time to use the system, management support, and issues around responsibility for\npayment (from central overhead or from users' budgets).\nKnowledge areas, competencies and skills\nTable 3 compares the key knowledge areas for providers, graduate students and participants.\nThere was a lot of similarity in the areas listed across the three groups, albeit with differences\nin the individual hierarchies for each group. The key areas were thus, in aggregate, finance,\nIT, management, and operations \/ SCM. 'Legal' was also listed by the participants group\n(instead of finance). Table 4 compares the competencies and skills required for the three\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 16, No. 2, pp.178-191, 2005\n11\ngroups. The providers and graduate students had the exact same hierarchy of factors. The\nparticipants group had three of the same four factors as the other two groups, but with a\ndifferent hierarchical ranking. The key competencies and skills were thus, in aggregate,\nanalytical, interpersonal, leadership and change management. 'Project management' was also\nlisted by the participants group (instead of analytical). Other key knowledge areas and\ncompetencies \/ skills which were identified during the course of the research (via the provider\ninterviews, individual survey respondent comments, etc.) included specific competencies for\nemerging markets, an understanding of multimodal logistics, an understanding of security\nand international trade rules, and the ability to think in terms of processes and flows.\nProviders Graduate students Participants\n=1.

Overall, the providers and graduate students shared similar views, while some\ndifferences existed between these groups and the participants group.

The listing of factors\nin the table would appear to dovetail quite closely with the key business transformations and\nimplications for management skills identified by Christopher (2004) and illustrated in Table 1\n- for example, one of the key transformations he lists is that from functions to processes with\na resulting requirement for cross-functional understanding. The listing in table 5 would\nappear to suggest that the supply chain manager\u2019s job is indeed complex and\nmultidimensional, requiring both general management and logistics \/ supply chain specific\nknowledge, competencies and skills. Christopher (2004) notes that 'there is clearly a need for\nan acceleration in the rate at which these critical skills can be acquired and new mechanisms\nmust be developed to enable this to happen. For logistics educators there are exciting\nopportunities for creating more flexible and innovative ways of meeting the growing demand\nfor training and development in logistics and supply chain management'.\nPreferred teaching approaches\nProviders Graduate students\n1.

Site visits\nTable 6 Comparison: Preferred teaching approaches\nTable 6 compares the preferred teaching approaches as viewed by providers and graduate\nstudents. While similar approaches were listed by both groups (simulations, cases and\nlectures), the relative hierarchies differed. Furthermore, two other areas were also ranked\n(one each by each group), namely group projects (by providers) and site visits (by graduate\nstudents). Approaches and issues mentioned during other phases of the research (via the\nprovider interviews, individual survey respondent comments, etc.) included the need for\ncourses to be more practical, the use of properly sequenced and structured in-class exercises,\nand the benefits in terms of skills development for individual learners which can accrue from\ngroup projects, student presentations, small student seminars and discussion groups. On this\nlatter point what was perhaps interesting was that no mention was made during the course of\nthis research by any of the respondents of learning from peers (in terms of specific logistics \/\nsupply chain knowledge, as opposed to general skills development). The case study of\nlogistics \/ supply chain management development at Glaxosmithkline also highlighted the\nefficiencies and benefits for both the organisation and individual learners which are leveraged\nfrom their blended learning approach. Again, these various insights concur with what was\nelaborated in the literature review, and hopefully add further insights.\nOptimum approaches for career development\nOnly the providers\u2019 survey comprised questions around optimum approaches for career\ndevelopment. A focused masters degree in logistics \/ SCM emerged as the favoured\napproach for developing and advancing a career in logistics \/ SCM (this could of course be\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 16, No. 2, pp.178-191, 2005\n13\ndue to respondent bias in that many of the respondents will likely be directly involved with\nsuch degrees). This was closely followed by in-company \/ tailored executive education\nprogrammes in logistics \/ supply chain management (as distinct from open \/ public\nprogrammes which were ranked fourth). The other issue highlighted with regard to career\ndevelopment during the course of the research is the need for coaching and development for\nthe relatively young and inexperienced managers who comprise a large proportion of the\ncommunity of supply chain managers in many developing countries.\nAREAS FOR FURTHER WORK\nIn any research exercise there is always insufficient time to investigate the many issues and\ndimensions one would like to investigate. Furthermore, new issues and other insights do\nemerge during the course of a research exercise which are worthy of investigation. Areas for\nfurther investigation we identified include:\n\uf0b7 in-depth case studies on best practice logistics \/ supply chain management development at\nparticular organisations are likely to be very insightful, certainly given our experience\nwith the large pharmaceutical company we studied.\n\uf0b7 Extending the research effort to include perceptions of preferred teaching approaches\namong participants on executive education programmes.\n\uf0b7 Examining the learning styles and abilities of different types of participants on logistics\nprogrammes (e.g. those working in the field for a long period, new entrants to the field,\nthose with formal third level qualifications versus those without such qualifications, etc.)\n\uf0b7 Continuing on the learning theme, examining the link between individual, organisational\nand supply chain learning. Issues in this regard were considered in the literature review\nabove and again arose in the context of the discussion on knowledge management with\nGlaxosmithkline.\nIt is apparent from our research that the demand for experienced and qualified supply chain\nmanagers exceeds the current supply. Whilst there are a growing number of universities and\nbusiness schools that offer specialist programmes at degree and post-experience level, the\ntake-up of these programmes is very small against the perceived need. A small number of\ncompanies, usually large and global, have recognised the need for a more pro-active approach\nto logistics and supply chain management development through the creation and provision of\nin-house learning capabilities. The opportunities for partnerships between academic\ninstitutions and the corporate sector in developing and delivering knowledge and learning in\nthese areas are also considerable. There can be no doubting that the achievement of supply\nchain excellence in the marketplace can only be built upon excellence in the skills and\ncompetencies of the people who manage those supply chains. For the moment it seems that\nthere is still some way to go.\nReferences\nBessant, J., Lamming, R. and Kaplinsky, R.
