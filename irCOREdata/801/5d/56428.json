The species under study,\nthe monogonont rotifer Brachionus plicatilis, is a zooplank-\ntonic invertebrate, typically found in water bodies where\nenvironmental factors restrict population growth to short\nperiods lasting days or months. The adverse conditions\nfor growth include evaporation of water in temporary\nhabitats leading to desiccation, unfavorable temperatures,\nand lack of food or appearance of predators. This is a rel-\natively hostile environment and the survival of the popu-\nlation in such conditions is ensured via the production of\nresting eggs. These show a remarkable tolerance to unfa-\nvorable conditions and may be stored for decades [1,2].\nTheir high reproductive rates facilitate colonization of\nvacant niches with extreme rapidity, converting primary\nproduction (algal and bacterial) into a form usable for\nsecondary consumers with remarkable efficiency [3]. Con-\nsequently, the euryhaline rotifer Brachionus plicatilis, has\nbeen developed as an essential food source for raising\nmarine fish larvae in marine fish hatcheries (reviewed in\n[4]).\nBrachionus plicatilis shows periodic parthenogenesis,\nwhere asexual reproduction is prevalent but under certain\ncircumstances sexual reproduction occurs (Figure 1). Par-\nthenogenesis dominates (amictic phase) the monogonont\nlife cycle in the absence of males, but following certain\nenvironmental cues, sexual reproduction (mictic phase)\ntakes place. Females that reproduce asexually are termed\n\"amictic\" and females that reproduce sexually are \"mic-\ntic\". Amictic females produce diploid eggs that develop by\nameiotic pathenogenesis into females. Mictic females are\nmorphologically similar to amictic females but produce\nhaploid (mictic) eggs via meiosis. These eggs will develop\nparthenogenetically into haploid males but if these mictic\nfemales are fertilized they will produce diploid resting\neggs. The haploid males are significantly smaller than the\nfemales and move faster. The mictic females produce rest-\ning eggs only if they are inseminated at a young age. Rest-\ning-egg production is therefore a consequence of\nswitching from an asexual type of reproduction to sexual\nreproduction. Resting eggs then undergo obligatory dia-\npause or dormancy, eventually hatching as amictic\nfemales [2,5-8]. It has also been suggested that certain\nclones show a higher tendency for sexual reproduction\nand resting-egg production than others, within the same\npopulation [9,10]. The factors inducing the mixis signal\nare largely unknown, although population density and\nenvironmental factors such as salinity, presence of phe-\nromones and food availability have been shown to play a\nrole [11-15].\nClues for the biological processes underlying the dormant\nstage can be inferred from other organisms, such as\nspores, plant seeds, cysts or resting eggs that display cryp-\ntobiosis where the metabolic rate is extremely low (~5%\nof normal) and associated with profound changes within\nthe cell [16,17]. Cryptobiosis is associated with desicca-\ntion or anhydrobiosis and involves protectants that stabi-\nlize cellular macromolecules for periods extending many\nyears [17]. These processes are often associated with the\nonset of stressful environmental conditions. However,\nproduction of rotifer resting eggs is not always stress\nrelated and resting eggs do not necessarily undergo desic-\ncation during their dormant period and therefore it\nremains to be shown whether these eggs express genes\nassociated with stress resistance and desiccation tolerance.\nTo date, there have been very few molecular studies on B.\nplicatilis and these have been mainly limited to single gene\nstudies on aging and environmental contamination [18-\n20] and a small-scale EST project [21]. None of these\nrelate to resting-egg formation or dormancy.\nThe aim of the present study was to develop EST resources\nof B. plicatilis for future molecular analyses into the dor-\nmancy process in this organism. Four EST libraries were\nconstructed: a mixed stage rotifer culture, females with\nresting eggs, resting eggs and resting eggs during hatching.\nThe libraries were normalized in order to increase the\nchances of discovering rarely expressed genes. In addition,\nfour subtractive libraries were constructed with the aim of\nenhancing the gene diversity of the ESTs. In this paper we\ncharacterize the EST libraries and identify putative genes\nassociated with dormancy, formation and survival of\nrotifer resting eggs.\nResults and discussion\nA total of 47,926 sequences remained after clone sequenc-\ning and quality checking and these had a minimum tran-\nscript size of 100 bp and an average of 538 bp. Sequencing\neffort was concentrated on the normalized libraries,\nwhich comprised 91.2% of the dataset, with between\n21.5\u201324.9% contributed by each library (Table 1). Prelim-\ninary sequencing was performed on the subtractive librar-\nies (approximately 1000 clones each) and therefore these\nonly comprise 8.8% of the EST sequences (Table 2). The\ngene discovery and diversity rates of all libraries are rela-\ntively high (0.53\u20130.68 and 0.36\u20130.46 respectively) with\nthe exception of the sbs04 subtractive library. Gene dis-\ncovery is defined as the number of different \"genes\" each\nlibrary contributed, divided by library size and gene diver-\nsity is defined as the number of singletons in each library\ndivided by library size [22].\nIn spite of the subtractive process, this library was still\nhighly redundant, potentially indicating massive gene\nredundancy within mictic females and their associatedPage 2 of 17\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:108 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/108\nPage 3 of 17\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nThe life cycle of Brachionus plicatilis showing asexual and sexual reproduction and formation of resting eggsFigur 1\nThe life cycle of Brachionus plicatilis showing asexual and sexual reproduction and formation of resting eggs. In \nthe asexual life cycle, diploid amictic females produce parthenogenetic diploid amictic eggs. A mixis signal initiates the occur-\nrence of a sexual cycle, whereby, diploid mictic females produce haploid eggs via meiosis. The haploid eggs develop into either \nhaploid males or, if fertilized, they form diploid dormant (or diapausing) resting eggs. The internal insemination of diploid mictic \nfemales carrying haploid eggs, is possible for only a few hours after birth. Mictic females are shaded in grey and include mictic \nfemales producing male eggs or mictic females that form diploid resting eggs. All females are diploid while males are haploid.\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:108 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/108resting eggs. Ten contigs comprise 27.4% of the library\nsequences. Three of the ten contigs (7.7% of the library)\nshow no match to known sequences in the database and\nfour contigs (12.9%) have a highly repeated amino acid\nstructure, which cannot be ascribed to a particular gene or\ngene family (Table 3). None of these highly repeated pro-\nteins show similar homologies to each other, being 36\u2013\n40% identical at the nucleotide level. One contig (clone\nsbs04P0012K21) shows similarity to putative oxidore-\nductases. This classification is applied to all enzymes that\nhave oxidoreductase functions, however some are\ninvolved in acting on superoxide radicals, which are pro-\nduced during stressful situations (c.f. resting eggs). Also of\nsignificant interest are the two other matches to ferritin\n(pearl oyster) and hsp26 (Artemia urmiana). In studies on\nthe crustacean Artemia franciscana, which forms cysts in\nresponse to adverse conditions, two proteins were shown\nto be present in large amounts in the cysts; hsp26 and\nartemin (a ferritin homologue) [23,24].

This percentage identifica-\ntion is much lower than a recently published EST library\nof B. plicatilis [21], in which 80% of sequences showed\nsimilarity to database entries.\nHowever, the number of ESTs in the Suga library was rel-\natively small (2,362 ESTs), non-normalised and a signifi-\ncant proportion of the sequences formed a single cluster\nencoding the small ribosomal sub-unit. In total, almost\n23% of the 2,362 ESTs were comprised of 14 clusters with\nmatches ranging from cathepsin L to beta tubulin. Com-\nparison of our ESTs with those of Suga et al., [21] using\nBLASTN (E value < 10-10) showed that 93% of the ESTs in\nthe Suga library were represented in our dataset.\nThe main objective of this EST project was to develop tran-\nscriptome resources for B. plicatilis, which could be used in\nfuture global expression experiments. Therefore, the strat-\negy of normalization and subtraction was used in library\nproduction. Although this should maximize the number\nof different transcripts obtained, it does mean that quan-\ntitative comparisons between libraries is not possible\nwithout further verification. Given this limitation, analy-\nses were targeted at candidate genes involved in maintain-\ning the stability and the integrity of cell compartments\nand macromolecules, as these are key factors for survival\nduring dormancy. Searches were carried out using both\nBLAST and GO annotations and identified genes desig-\nnated as or involved in:\n\u2022 Protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and\ndetoxification: ROS are toxic in all life stages but they\nare especially problematic for dormant forms.

More in-\ndepth analysis revealed that these 129 transcripts com-\nprise 11 distinct putative genes (designated Bpa-gst-1 to\nBpa-gst-11, where Bpa stands for Brachionus plicatilis Atlit),\nwhich on sequence similarity searching appear to most\nclosely match the alpha class of cytosolic GSTs. This is by\nfar the most abundant of cytosolic subfamilies often com-\nprising tens of members in each species [36] (c.f. 44 anno-\ntated GSTs identified in C. elegans [37]). Five of the\nputative rotifer GSTs show closest sequence matches to C.\nelegans genes, all of which are heavily documented in\nWormbase with regard to expression and functional stud-\nies. Whilst those GSTs most similar to the rotifer tran-\nscripts all show expression responses to electrophilic\nstress [38], interestingly GST-5 occurred in an expression\ncluster of strongly regulated dauer genes\n(WBPaper00024393; [39]). Although functions of genes\n(even orthologues) differ between species, and this is par-\nticularly the case with multiple gene family members, the\ndauer is a stage of larval arrest in C. elegans, which could\nequate functionally to the resting-egg stage in the rotifer.\nTable 4: Putative transcripts for members of the Glutathione-S-transferase family Identified in the EST libraries.\nContig Signature clone Acession number\/Best BLAST match Organism E-value MS RE REH FRE sbs04\nbpa-gst-1 sb101P0003M09 O18598\/Glutathione-S-transferase Blattella germanica 3 E-23 8 0 0 6 0\nbpa-gst-2 sb102P0001B13 P04904\/Glutathione-S-transferase alpha-3 Rattus norvegicus 3 E-21 5 2 6 7 0\nbpa-gst-3 sb102P0027M10 Q7REH6\/Glutathione-S-transferase Plasmodium yoelii yoelii 5 E-24 0 1 0 1 0\nbpa-gst-4 sb103P0011A24 P26697\/Glutathione-S-transferase-3 Gallus gallus 6 E-26 0 0 6 2 0\nbpa-gst-5 sb104P0024A03 Q9NAW7\/Glutathione-S-transferase Haemonchus contortus 5 E-33 5 0 6 13 0\nbpa-gst-6 sb104P0018P05 P91253\/Probable Glutathione-S-\ntransferase-7\nCaenorhabditis elegans 5 E-25 0 2 0 2 0\nbpa-gst-7 sb102P0010B06 Q21355\/Glutathione-S-transferase-4 Caenorhabditis elegans 9 E-23 0 11 0 4 0\nbpa-gst-8 sbs04P0006G07 P91252\/Probable Glutathione-S-\ntransferase-6\nCaenorhabditis elegans 5 E-20 0 13 0 3 11\nbpa-gst-9 sb101P0040I16 P30568\/Glutathione-S-transferase-A Pleuronectes platessa 2 E-45 0 4 2 6 0\nbpa-gst-10 sb104P0023E22 P91253\/Probable Glutathione-S-\ntransferase-7\nCaenorhabditis elegans 5 E-28 1 0 0 1 0\nbpa-gst-11 sb102P0019M19 Q09596\/Probable Glutathione-S-\ntransferase-5\nCaenorhabditis elegans 9 E-17 0 1 0 0 0\nTotal 19 34 20 45 11\nSignature clones are given for transcripts (consensus sequences) composed of contigs.Page 6 of 17\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:108 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/108Indeed, this gene was only found in the resting-egg\nlibrary, clearly a candidate for further investigation. No\nGSTs were found in the first three subtractive libraries, but\nthis may not be surprising given the small sample size of\nthe sequencing effort, or alternatively, their number was\nsmall as a consequence of subtractions.\nFurther searches for antioxidant enzymes identified 135\nclones, which assembled into 11 putative transcripts cod-\ning for peroxiredoxins (E values between 10-27 to 10-77)\nand thioredoxin peroxidase activity (E value of 10-57)\n(data not shown). Members of these families were found\nin all normalized libraries and Bpa-trpx-6 and Bpa-trpx-7\nwere additionally found in the sbs04 library associated\nwith resting eggs (data not shown). Antioxidant activity is\nalso associated with the enzyme phospholipid-hydroper-\noxide glutathione peroxidase, which protects membranes\nfrom oxidative stress by reducing the membrane\nhydroperoxides [40]. Twenty-nine clones were found to\nbe associated with phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutath-\nione peroxidase activity (GO:0047066) in the EST librar-\nies and two putative transcripts were produced after contig\nassembly and were named gpx1 and gpx2. The transcript\ngpx1 was only found in the MS and sbs01 libraries, whilst\ngpx2 was found in all the normalized libraries. BLAST\nresults for the two transcripts were quite different: gpx1\nmatched mammalian glutathione peroxidase 3 (E value =\n10-42) and gpx2 matched phosphlipid-hydroperoxide glu-\ntathione peroxidase of hydra and cattle tick (E value = 10-\n20), and of mammals (E value 10-18), although both con-\nfer antioxidant protection. The presence of two genes indi-\ncates a duplication of the gpx genes in the rotifer.\nDismutases catalyze the conversion of superoxide radicals\ninto hydrogen peroxide, preventing their conversion into\nthe more active hydroxyl radical [25]. Five putative tran-\nscripts were found to be associated with superoxide dis-\nmutase activity (GO:0004784). Two transcripts show\nhomology with the Mn-SOD (E value = 10-111) previously\ndescribed by [19]. Three other transcripts were found to\nbe similar to Cu\/Zn-SOD. Transcripts were found across\nseveral different libraries and so could be designated as\nubiquitous. However, the previously identified Mn-SOD\nof B. plicatilis was found to be over-expressed in rotifers\nwith an extended life span resulting from caloric restric-\ntion [19]. Similarly in C. elegans, the DAF pathway (insu-\nlin, dauer associated) is also linked to caloric restriction\nand increased lifespan. Therefore these genes clearly have\nother roles in addition to putative functions associated\nwith desiccation.\nMaintaining the native folded conformation of proteins\nChanges in environmental conditions (e.g. osmotic pres-\nsure, pH, temperature and desiccation), challenge protein\nstructure and may cause the formation of cytotoxic pro-\ntein aggregates and induce the production of \"stress\" pro-\nteins [41]. Therefore, desiccation tolerant resting eggs\nneed to develop mechanisms for coping with denaturing\nand aggregation of proteins. The classical cellular\nresponse to this type of stress is the induction of \"heat\nshock\" or chaperone proteins [42-44] which facilitate the\ndisaggregation of proteins and their refolding to native\nconformation, and\/or the production of small heat shock\nproteins, which prevent initial protein aggregation [26].\nBLAST searches revealed 10 putative transcripts (6 contigs\nand 4 singletons) with matches to the HSP70 superfamily.\nFurther analysis narrowed this to 6 putative genes as four\nof the sequences were potentially non-overlapping sec-\ntions of the same genes (Table 5). Of the six putative\ngenes, three showed significant sequence similarity to the\nclassical stress inducible HSP70 gene (Bpa-hsp70-1, Bpa-\nhsp70-3 and Bpa-hsp-6). The best database match to this\ngene was from the organism Microplitis mediator, an\northopteran parasite and interestingly the publication\nannotation associated with this entry [Swiss-\nProt:A8D4R0] indicates that this gene is associated with\ndiapause. All other putative genes are HSP70 family mem-\nbers and although the functional annotation is variable,\nall are potentially involved in the stress response. HSPA9\n(Bpa-hsp70-4) is additionally implicated in the control of\ncell proliferation and cellular aging, whilst GRP170 (Bpa-\nhsp70-5) has a pivotal role in cytoprotection, specifically\ntriggered in response to hypoxia [45], both factors which\nare almost certainly associated with resting-egg formation.\nNone of the rotifer sequences showed any significant sim-\nilarity to the rotifer HSP70 sequence previously isolated\n[DDBJ:AB076052]), which is most similar to the constitu-\ntive form of this family (HSC70) and has been shown to\nbe expressed during population growth [18]. Members of\nthe HSP70 family were found in all normalized libraries\nand in two of the subtracted libraries.\nAlthough members of the HSP70 family are regarded as\nthe classical cellular stress response, the small heat shock\nproteins are being increasingly identified as having a piv-\notal role in survival in stressful conditions and metabolic\narrest [23]. Encysted embryos of Artemia franciscana have\nbeen shown to contain substantial amounts of HSP26\n[46,47] along with a ferritin homologue [24], with both\nmolecules acting as chaperones to prevent protein aggre-\ngation.\nA search for small heat-shock proteins revealed five puta-\ntive transcripts (5 contigs). One primarily matched an \u03b1-\ncrystallin protein, (Ornithodoros parkeri, E value = 7\u00b710-\n13), but this is not surprising as the \u03b1-crystalline domains\nare characteristic of small heat shock proteins [26] and\nindeed all the deduced amino acid sequences of putative\nrotifer small HSPs described here contain an \u03b1-crystallinPage 7 of 17\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:108 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/108conserved domain. This first transcript was found exclu-\nsively in the normalized libraries containing resting eggs\n(RE and FRE). Four additional different transcripts were\nidentified in the subtractive sbs04 library (Table 6). Over-\nall, small HSP transcripts were highly represented in the\nsbs04 library comprising 55 clones out of 1203 (~4.5%),\nand significantly, this was the only subtracted library to\ncontain resting eggs. The sequence similarity of the puta-\ntive rotifer small HSPs to small HSPs in the databases was\nlow, in the region of 30% identity, but the small HSPs,\ncontrary to the situation with HSP70, are not highly con-\nserved between species. For example, comparing\nsequences from C. briggsae [Swiss-Prot:A8XDE7] to C. ele-\ngans [Swiss-Prot:P02513] and the pink hibiscus mealy bug\n[Swiss-Prot:A2I3W3] produces 28.6% amino acid iden-\ntity\/46% amino acid similarity and 29.2% identity\/42.6%\nsimilarity, respectively. Given this lack of conservation,\nand that BLAST matches of the rotifer sequences were\nexclusive to other small HSPs, it is reasonable to assume\nthat putative genes coding for small heat shock proteins\nare found in rotifers, particularly in resting eggs.\nRegarding additional candidates for further investigation\nin resting-egg stage gene expression, a number of other\nheat shock proteins were identified (HSP60 and HSP80-\n100). Induction of the HSP60 protein was previously\nTable 5: Putative transcripts for members of the HSP70 family identified in the EST Libraries.\nContig Signature clone Organism Accession number\/Gene \ndescription\nE value MS RE REH FRE sbs01 sbs03\nbpa-hsp70-1 sb102P0043E07 Macrobrachium rosenbergii Q6S4R6\/Heat shock protein \n70\n6E-61 0 3 0 2 0 0\nbpa-hsp70-2 sb103P0045K15 Crassostrea gigas Q75W49\/78kDa glucose \nregulated protein\n< 1E-200 3 4 2 3 0 0\nbpa-hsp70-3 sb103P0048K15 Homo sapiens Q2TAL4\/Heat shock 70 kDa \nprotein 4\n2E-65 2 (1) 1 (2) 1 1 0\nbpa-hsp70-4 sbs01P0007O18 Homo sapiens Q8N1C8\/HSPA9 protein < 1E-200 7 2 0 4 (1) 1 1\nbpa-hsp70-5 sbs01P0006A07 Rattus norvegicus Q6P136\/Hyou1 protein \n(alias GRP170)\n6E-37 3 0 0 0 1 0\nbpa-hsp70-6 sb103P0021G10 Microplitis mediator A8D4R0\/Heat shock protein \n70\n8E-99 0 (1) 1 (2) (1) 0 0\nTotal 15 11 8 12 3 1\nSignature clones are given for transcripts (consensus sequences) composed of contigs.\nTable 6: Putative transcripts for members of the small heat shock family identified in the EST libraries.\nGene Clone Accession number\/Best BLAST \nmatch\nOrganism E-value RE FRE sbs02 sbs04\nbpa-shsp-1 sb104P0004B19 A6N9U9\/Alpha crystallin Ornithodoros parkeri Soft tick 7.0 E-13 8 5 0 0\nbpa-shsp-2 sbs04P0011I16 Q000T2\/Small heat shock protein Trichinella pseudospiralis Nematode 6.0 E-7 0 0 3 13\nbpa-shsp-3 sbs04P0012K07 Q000T3\/Small heat shock protein Trichinella spiralis Trichina worm 2.0 E-7 0 0 0 25\nbpa-shsp-4 sbs04P0012F21 P02516\/Heat shock protein 23 Drosophila melanogaster Fruit fly 6.0 E-7 0 0 0 12\nbpa-shsp-5 sbs04P0012E13 P27777\/16.9kDa class I heat shock \nprotein (HSP11)\nOryza sativa subs.

Eleven putative\ntranscripts with matches to HSP60 were found, as were\nputative transcripts with matches to other high molecular\nweight heat-shock proteins (HSP80-100). These candi-\ndates were found in all of the normalized libraries.\nLate Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins\nLEA proteins were originally identified in plant seeds dur-\ning the late stages of embryonic development and are\nassociated with desiccation tolerance throughout the life\ncycle of all major plant taxa [50]. They comprise a protein\nfamily with three major groups (Groups 1\u20133). They have\nalso been found in non-plant species and to date almost\nall non-plant LEA proteins belong to Group 3 [51]. LEAs\nhave been found in the nematode Aphelenchus avenae [52],\nbdelliod rotifers [53,54] and desiccated A. franciscana\ncysts [55]. The exact function of LEA proteins is as yet,\nunknown, but their importance in desiccation and stress\ntolerance has been comprehensively demonstrated. For\nexample, silencing of the lea gene in C. elegans dauer juve-\nniles caused a significant reduction of worm survival dur-\ning induction of desiccation and in osmotic and heat\nstresses [56]. LEA proteins were found to prevent protein\naggregation in vitro [57]. Also, in vivo experiments using\nAphelenchus avenae LEA proteins introduced into human\ncell lines demonstrated that these proteins played a role in\nanti-aggregation and protein stabilisation during desicca-\ntion procedures [58].\nThree transcripts matching group 3 LEA proteins on\nBLAST sequence similarity analyses were identified (E val-\nues in the range of 1E-11 \u2013 5E-25). These have been desig-\nnated bpa-lea-1, bpa-lea-2 and bpa-lea-3 (Table 7). A rooted\nNJ tree was produced using translations of these tran-\nscripts with canonical plant LEA proteins from all three\nmajor groups [59] and the metazoan LEA proteins of C.\nelegans, A. franciscana, P. vanderplanki, and A. avenae (Fig-\nure 2). The putative rotifer genes were associated with the\nGroup 3 protein family.\nTrehalose metabolism\nTrehalose is thought to play an important role in enhanc-\ning desiccation and stress tolerance [60]. For example,\naccumulation of trehalose has been shown in diapausing\ncysts of Artemia [61] and also the stress responses of nem-\natodes [62,63]. Trehalose is synthesized from glucose, cat-\nalyzed by the enzymes trehalose-6-phosphate synthase\n(tps) and trehalose phosphatase [64]. Trehalose can com-\nprise ~17% of the dry mass in Artemia undergoing desic-\ncation [65] and small amounts (0.35% of dry weight)\nhave previously been found in B. plicatilis desiccated rest-\ning eggs [28]. Also a transcript [DDBJ: BJ979617] with\nhigh sequence similarity to the tps gene, encoding to tre-\nhalose phosphate synthase, was previously identified in\nan EST library of B. plicatilis [21].\nTen ESTs (1 contig and 7 singletons) were identified in the\ndifferent libraries for trehalose-6-phosphate synthase but\nthere was no particular association with the libraries con-\ntaining resting eggs. In-depth analysis revealed that the\nten ESTs could be assigned to three groups comprising\nnon-overlapping regions of the tps gene. In spite of this\nfragmentation, it was possible to identify that two para-\nlogues (Table 8) were present and that the rotifer, like C.\nelegans, has a duplication of the tps gene [62]. Other\nmodel organisms, such as the insects Drosophila mela-\nnogaster, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae and baker's yeast,\nS. cerevisiae [66] possess only a single tps gene, but this\nmay be a reflection on lifestyle and the requirement to\nsurvive stressful conditions. In support of this, phyloge-\nnetic analysis has shown adaptive selection operating on\nthe glucose-6-phosphate branch point enzymes and adja-\ncent pathways (including tps) with the conclusion that\nthis evolutionary pressure has played a significant role in\nmetabolic adaptation [67]. The C. elegans paralogues\nshowed only 48% identity overall, but they were slightly\ndifferent lengths (1229 amino acids [Swiss-Prot:O45380]\n(F19H8.1) and 1331 amino acids [Swiss-\nProt:Q7YZT6](ZK54.2)) and particularly differed at the 5'\nand 3' ends. The two fragments of tps from the rotifer were\n88.9% identical at the amino acid level, but these frag-\nments did include the most conserved central portion of\nTable 7: Putative transcripts for Late Embryonic Abundant proteins (LEA) identified in the EST libraries.\nContig EST singnature Contig size Best BLAST match E value MS RE REH FRE sbs04 sbs02\nbpa-lea-1 sb104P0049I13 25 Q6NMC2\/LEA-like 5E-25 0 7 1 5 12 0\nbpa-lea-2 sbs04P0011H05 35 Q9FKV7\/LEA-like 1E-22 3 5 3 4 20 0\nbpa-lea-3 sbs02P0007H12 3 Q9FKV7\/LEA-like 1E-11 0 0 0 0 2 1\nTotal 3 12 4 9 34 1\nAll match transcripts from Arabidopsis thaliana.Page 9 of 17\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:108 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/108\nPage 10 of 17\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nRooted NJ tree of lea-like deduced proteins, LEA proteins of other invertebrates and canonical plant LEA proteins from the three major groupsFigure 2\nRooted NJ tree of lea-like deduced proteins, LEA proteins of other invertebrates and canonical plant LEA pro-\nteins from the three major groups.

In addition to the duplication of the trehalose-6-\nphosphate synthase gene in C. elegans, this species also\nshows a duplication of the trehalase gene, the enzyme\nwhich breaks down trehalose. In fact, there are four treha-\nlase genes annotated in Ensembl [W05E10.4, F57B10.7,\nT05A12.2 and C23H3.7] [66]. BLAST searches of the\nrotifer data produced three singletons with matches to tre-\nhalase (data not shown). Although these were single reads\nand therefore sequence quality was variable, there were\nsufficient differences between the putative translations of\nthese clones to indicate that they were potentially three\ndifferent genes, demonstrating another situation analo-\ngous with the nematode. Although the C. elegans\nsequences are similar at the sequence level to other char-\nacterized trehalases (hence the annotation), they are des-\nignated as \"unknown function\", as RNAi studies produce\nno obvious phenotype. It has yet to be determined why\nthere are four copies of this gene in C. elegans and what is\nthe exact function of each paralogue. By extrapolation the\nsame can be inferred for the three putative trehalases in\nthe rotifer.\nAquaporins\nAquaprorins are transmembrane proteins that serve as\nchannels for water and small soluble molecules transport\n[29]. These proteins have been found to play a role in des-\niccation tolerance in seeds [30] and freeze tolerance in\nyeast [31]. Three different putative aquaporin transcripts\nwere identified in the EST libraries (Table 9) with E values\nin the range of 6E-22 \u2013 1E-26. These were designated: bpa-\naqp-1, bpa-aqp-2 and bpa-aqp-3. Exact assignment of these\nputative rotifer genes to aquaporin family members was\ndifficult because of relatively short sequence lengths and\nlow percentage similarity to aquaporin genes already in\nthe databases. However, on BLAST assignment, the first\ntwo transcripts matched aquaporins 3, 7, 9 or 10, which\nare glycerol channels, while the third matched aquaporins\n4, 2, 1 or the plant protein TIP. These genes are under fur-\nther investigation and full length transcripts are being\ngenerated by RACE PCR for functional analyses.\nLipid and fatty acid metabolism\nAlso of interest were genes associated with lipid metabo-\nlism as this may be the only source for energy whilst\nembryonic development is arrested and during hatching if\nsimilarities are assumed with other dormant or hibernat-\ning organisms. For example lipid metabolic pathways\nwere up-regulated in the C. elegans dauer larval stage [33].\nLipids also serve as the main energy source in hibernating\nmammals [32].

There were 28 clones (4 contigs and 2 single-\ntons) matching lipoprotein lipase (Table 10) in the\nlibraries. Lipoprotein lipases are also known to serve as\nyolk proteins in dipterans eggs [69], in contrast to vitello-\ngenins that are the main yolk proteins in almost all egg\nforming organisms [34,70]. Surprisingly, no BLAST\nmatches were identified for vitellogenin, suggesting that\nlipoprotein lipase may serve as a yolk protein of B. plicati-\nlis. Allied to the possession of lipoprotein lipases are fatty\nacid-binding proteins (FABP) which are assumed to be\ninvolved in fatty acid uptake, transport and metabolism.\nThese proteins are members of the lipocalin superfamily\nthat are transporters of small hydrophobic molecules such\nas lipids, steroid hormones, bilins and retinoids [71].\nBoth fatty acid and retinoid binding may be important for\nresting-egg formation as fatty acids may serve as an energy\nsource during dormancy and retinoids are associated with\nembryonic development [72,73]. Five putative transcripts\nwere identified as lipocalins (Table 11). For each tran-\nscript, the highest number of clones within the normal-\nized libraries was found in library FRE (females with\nresting eggs) and one transcript was also found in library\nsbs04. These results may suggest a role of lipocalins in\nresting-egg production.\nExpression experiments\nSince all libraries were produced using either normalized\nor subtractive methods, real-time PCR experiments were\nconducted in order to assess the expression of selected\ngenes in resting eggs and in resting-egg producing females\n(see [additional file 1] Table S1). The expression patterns\nof the selected genes were determined in resting eggs rela-\ntive to amictic eggs, and in resting-egg producing females\nrelative to amictic females (Fig. 3). It should be noted that\nin all cases the 95% confidence limits in the female sam-\nples were expanded compared to those of the egg samples.\nThis may be attributed to the larger inherent variability\nbetween females, related to their age and size.\nGenes upregulated in resting eggs include all the lea-like\ntranscripts, a small heat shock protein and two of the\ngenes involved in antioxidant activities: one of the glu-\ntathione S-transferases (Bpa-gst-8) and a superoxide dis-\nmutase (Mn-sod-2). Two gst-like transcripts were chosen\nfor analysis: Bpa-gst-8, identified in the normalized librar-\nies associated with resting eggs (RE, FRE) and also the sub-\ntracted library containing resting eggs, and gst-2 found in\nall the normalized libraries. As mentioned above, gst-8 is\nup-regulated in resting eggs and in resting-egg producing\nfemales. No significant change in the expression of gst-2\nwas found in resting eggs relative to amictic eggs but it was\nslightly up-regulated in resting-egg producing females.\nTherefore, the two gene family members clearly play dif-\nferent roles in cellular defense mechanisms.\nThe relative expression of tps-1 transcript was determined\nin order to evaluate the significance of trehalose synthesis\nin resting-egg production. The results do not show any sig-\nnificant change in the expression of the tps-1 like gene in\nTable 10: Putative transcripts for members of the lipoprotein lipase family (lpl), members identified in the EST libraries.\nContig EST signature Contig size Accession number\/Best \nBLAST match\nOrganism E value MS RE REH FRE sbs01\nbpa-lpl-1 sb101P0009I07 12 Q9VX01\/CG6847-PA Drosophila melanogaster \nFruit fly\n1E-37 4 0 0 8 0\nbpa-lpl-2 sb104P0049B13 8 Q16LG0\/Triacylglycerol \nlipase, pancreatic\nAedes aegypti Yellow fever \nmosquito\n1E-33 3 0 0 5 0\nbpa-lpl-3 sb104P0004K06 2 Q66KX1\/MGC85357 \nprotein\nXenopus laevis African \nclawed toad\n3E-26 1 0 0 1 0\nbpa-lpl-4 sb104P0019A08 4 Q66KX1\/MGC85357 \nprotein\nXenopus laevis African \nclawed toad\n1E-43 1 0 0 1 2\nbpa-lpl-5 sbs01P0007D23 1 Q16LG0\/Triacylglycerol \nlipase, pancreatic\nAedes aegypti Yellow fever \nmosquito\n1E-16 0 0 0 1\nbpa-lpl-6 sb104P0004K06 1 A0MBZ6\/Pancreatic lipase Meleagris gallopavo \nCommon turkey\n2E-25 0 0 0 1 0\nTotal 9 0 0 16 3\nSignature clones are given for transcripts (concensus sequences) composed of contigs.Page 12 of 17\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:108 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/108\nPage 13 of 17\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTable 11: Putative transcripts for members of the fatty acid binding proteins (fab) family identified in the EST libraries.\nContig EST \nsingnature\nContig size Acession \nnumber\/Best \nBLAST match\nOrganism E value MS RE REH FRE sbs01 sbs02 sbs04\nbpa-fab-1 sb101P0004F07 5 Q5EBJ0\/Fatty acid \nbinding protein 3\nMus musculus \nMouse\n1E-23 1 0 1 3 0 0 0\nbpa-fab-2 sb101P0022L08 10 Q90W92\/Heart-\ntype fatty acid-\nbinding protein\nFundulus \nheteroclitus \nKillifish\n1E-25 1 1 1 5 1 0 1\nbpa-fab-3 sb104P0003D03 3 Q5EBJ0\/Fatty acid \nbinding protein 3\nMus musculus \nMouse\n6E-25 0 0 0 1 0 2 0\nbpa-fab-4 sb102P0013H20 1 A8HG12\/Brain-\ntype fatty acid \nbinding protein\nEpinephelus \ncoioides Orange \nspotted grouper\n6E-18 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\nbpa-fab-5 sb103P0024C16 9 Q5EBJ0\/Fatty acid \nbinding protein 3\nMus musculus \nMouse\n8E-30 0 0 2 7 0 0 0\nTotal 2 2 4 16 1 2 1\nSignature clones are given for transcripts (concensus sequences) composed of contigs.\nExpression pattern of selected genes in resting eggs (RE) vs. amictic eggs (AE) and resting-egg producing females (FRE) vs. amic-tic females (FA)Figure 3\nExpression pattern of selected genes in resting eggs (RE) vs. amictic eggs (AE) and resting-egg producing \nfemales (FRE) vs. amictic females (FA). Genes that were tested include: the Late embryonic abundant protein (lea-1, lea-\n2, lea-3), small heat shock proteins (shsp-3), manganase supreroxide dismutase (mn-sod-2), copper or zinc superoxide dismutase \n(cu\/zn-sod-1), glutathione S-trasferase (gst-2, gst-8) and trehalose phosphate synthase (tps-1).\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:108 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/108resting eggs relative to amictic eggs or in resting-egg pro-\nducing females relative to amictic females. Hence, the\nexpression pattern of the tps-like transcript suggests that\nthis gene may not be associated with resting-egg produc-\ntion, although it cannot be discounted that trehalose pro-\nduction is regulated at the translational level or enzyme\nactivity rather than the transcriptional level.\nConclusion\nThe production of both normalized and subtractive EST\nlibraries from different samples of rotifer including rest-\ning-egg producing females, resting eggs and resting eggs\nduring hatching, resulted in a high coverage of the tran-\nscriptome of Brachionus plicatilis. A total of 47,926 clones\nwere sequenced, and these were assembled into 18,000\nputative transcripts. Genes known to be associated with\ndesiccation tolerance in other organisms were identified\nin the EST libraries. These included genes associated with\nantioxidant activity, low molecular weight heat shock pro-\nteins and LEA proteins. Real-time PCR confirmed that LEA\ntranscripts, small HSPs and some antioxidant genes were\nupregulated in resting eggs, therefore suggesting that des-\niccation tolerance is a characteristic feature of resting eggs\neven though they do not necessarily fully desiccate during\ndormancy. Production of trehalose is commonly associ-\nated with dormancy and genes associated with trehalose\nsynthesis were found in all the normalized libraries. How-\never, the role of trehalose in resting-egg formation and\nsurvival remains unclear since there was no significant dif-\nference between resting-egg producing females and amic-\ntic females in the expression of tps-1 gene. Matches to\nlipoprotein lipase proteins suggest that, similar to the sit-\nuation in dipterans, these proteins may serve as the yolk\nprotein in rotifers and probably not vitellogenin, that is\nfound in most other egg producing organisms. The 18,000\nBrachionus plicatilis putative transcripts will serve as a data-\nbase for future global expression experiments, particularly\nfor the further identification of dormancy related genes.\nMethods\nRotifer cultures and sample collection\nRotifers were hatched from resting eggs produced in the\nlaboratory from rotifers collected at a seaside pond in\nAtlit, (40 km south of Haifa, Israel) in 1981. Some of the\nresting eggs were hatched in 2003 and resting eggs pro-\nduced from them were stored in the laboratory. Resting\neggs from 1981 and 2003 were stored in the dark at 4\u00b0C\nand hatched in 2005. Four groups of samples were col-\nlected for libraries; (I) mixed stage cultures containing\nboth amictic and mictic females, (II) Resting eggs (RE),\n(III) resting eggs during hatching and (IV) mictic females\nwith resting eggs\n(I) Mixed stage rotifer cultures\nFour cloned cultures and one non-cloned culture were\ngrown in 400 ml sea water medium (40\u2030). The rotifers\nwere fed with the algae Nannochloropsis sp. Mixis was\ninduced by transferring the cultures to diluted sea water\nmedium (20\u2030). Samples were collected when males\nappeared in the cultures. Samples for RNA extraction were\ncollected by sieving the upper part of the culture with a\nplankton net (60 \u03bcm mesh). Rotifers were washed with\nsterile 20\u2030 diluted sea water and were re-suspended for\n1 hr in sterile 20\u2030 diluted sea water, in order to allow\nrotifers to empty their gut content. Rotifers were sieved\nagain with the plankton net, washed with sterile diluted\nsea water (20\u2030) and transferred into a 1.5 ml centrifuge\ntube. The rotifers were concentrated using a by short cen-\ntrifugation step. The pellet containing the rotifers was fro-\nzen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -70\u00b0C until required for\nRNA extraction.\n(II) resting egg collection\nAbout 30,000 resting eggs were collected from two 400 ml\nof a non-cloned cultures that were maintained in 10\u2030\ndiluted sea water.\n(III) resting eggs during hatching\nResting eggs were stored for three months in the dark at\n25\u00b0C. Hatching was initiated by exposing the resting eggs\nto light. Samples were collected 20 and 30 hrs after the ini-\ntiation of hatching initiation and used for the construc-\ntion of the cDNA library.\n(IV) Mictic females with resting eggs\nFemales with resting eggs were hand picked from cultures,\ndue to their low abundance in the mixed cultures. About\n1,000 females with resting eggs were picked from a cloned\nculture (clone 1B4) grown in a 400 ml 20\u2030 diluted sea\nwater medium. This culture was also used for the produc-\ntion of the subtractive libraries.\nRNA extraction and library preparation\nRNA was extracted with the TRIzol\u00ae reagent (Invitrogen)\nfollowing the manufacturer instructions. cDNA was syn-\nthesized using the SMART approach (SMART PCR cDNA\nsynthesis kit, Clontech, U.S.A.) and subsequently normal-\nized using duplex-specific nuclease (Trimmer kit, Evro-\ngen, Russia) according to manufacturer's instructions and\ndirectionally cloned into pAL32 (Evrogen, Russia). Sub-\ntractive cDNAs were constructed by suppression subtrac-\ntive hybridization (Evrogen, Russia) and cloned via the\nTOPO TA\u00ae cloning system (Invitrogen, U.S.A.). Plasmids\nwere transferred via electroporation into E. coli DH10B\n(Invitrogen, U.S.A.). Plasmids from the normalized librar-\nies were 5' end sequenced using the pALforward primer\n(5'-CTCGGGAAGCGCGCCATT-3') and Big Dye Termina-Page 14 of 17\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:108 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/108tor chemistry. Clones of the subtractive libraries were\nsequenced from both ends using T7 and T3 primers.\nSequences were determined on ABI 3730XL capillary\nsequencers (Applied Biosystems, USA).\ncDNA libraries construction and characterisation\nFour normalized libraries and four subtractive libraries\nwere constructed:\nMS: Normalized library of a mixed population consisting\nof amictic females, mictic females and males. The library\nwas generated from a combination of four cloned cultures\nand one non-cloned culture\nRE: Normalized library of resting eggs. The resting eggs\nwere obtained from a non-cloned culture.\nREH: Normalized library of resting eggs in various stages\nof hatching. The library was constructed from resting eggs\nthat were hatched for 20 or 30 hrs.\nFRE: Normalized library of mictic females with resting\neggs. The females were collected from a resting-egg pro-\nducing clone (clone 1B4).\nsbs01: Subtractive library of a mixed stage population\nfrom a combination of cloned and non-cloned cultures\n(tester) vs. mixed stage population of a clone 1B4 (driver)\nsbs02: Subtractive library of a mixes stage population of\nclone 1B4 (tester) vs. a mixed stage population of a com-\nbination of cloned and non-cloned cultures (driver).\nsbs03: Subtractive library of a mixed stage population of\nclone 1B4 (tester) vs. mictic females with resting eggs of\nclone 1B4 (driver).\nsbs04: Subtractive library of mictic females with resting\neggs as tester vs. mixed stage population of clone 1B4\n(driver).\nSequence analysis and EST clustering\nSequence fasta files were processed using the script\nTrace2dbest [74], which incorporated the phred and\ncrossmatch programmes [75,76]. A minimum cut-off\nvalue of 100bp was applied after quality control process-\ning for generating the submission file for EMBL (Acces-\nsion numbers, FM897377\u2013FM945301). Tgicl [77] was\nused for clustering the fasta files, incorporating quality\nscores, for each of the five libraries, as well as for all the\nlibraries together. The clusters were database searched\nusing Blastx [78] against the Uniprot\/Swissprot and Uni-\nprot\/Trembl databases [79], with matches annotated for\nall scores with an expect score in excess of 1e-10. These\nannotations were then used to map Gene Ontology iden-\ntifiers [80]. Sequence manipulation was carried out using\nthe EMBOSS suite of programs [81]. Multiple sequence\nalignments of LEA proteins were performed using the\nClustalW program. [82]. Phylogenetic trees were drawn\nwith MEGA4 [83] using the Bacillus subtilis glucose\ninducible starvation protein B (Accession no: P26907) as\nan outgroup.\nReal-Time PCR experiments\nThe relative abundance of bpa-lea-1, bpa-lea-2, bpa-lea-3,\nbpa-shsp-3, bpa-mnsod-2, bpa-cusod-1, bpa-gst-11, bpa-gst-4,\nbpa-tps-1 transcripts (see [additional file 1] Table S1 for\nthe list of primers) were normalized to an elongation fac-\ntor 1\u03b1 housekeeping sequence using the equation: ratio =\n(Etarget)CP_target\/(Eef1a)CP_ef1a where E = 10-1\/slop, according\nto the method described by Pfaffl et al., [84]. The PCR\nmixture consisted of 1 \u03bcl of cDNA sample, 70 nM of each\nprimer and 12.5 \u03bcl of SYBR Green master mix (ABgene,\nUK), in a final volume of 25 \u03bcl. Amplification were pre-\nformed with biological triplicate samples using a\nGenAmp 5700 thermocycler (PE Applied Biosystems,\nUSA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nAvailability\nESTs were deposited at EMBL with the accession numbers:\nFM897377\u2013FM945301.\nAuthors' contributions\nNYD performed and led the physiological rotifer experi-\nments, real-time PCR, bioinformatics analyses and drafted\nthe manuscript.
