A total of 15 case studies \nwere selected from developed countries in the EU where some schemes have operated \nfor more than a decade. Criteria for assessing the effectiveness and replicability of \nschemes were developed using scheme progress towards targets, response time, \ncompatibility with government policy, ease of administration and operation, and \npublic acceptance as attributes. The study demonstrates the capability of these \nschemes to significantly reduce household waste and suggests changes to allow their \npossible adoption in England. One of the main barriers to their adoption is the \nEnvironmental Protection Act, 1990 that prevents English local authorities (LAs) \nfrom implementing the variable charging method for household waste management. \nThis barrier could be removed through a change in legislation. The need to derive \nconsistent data and standardise the method of measuring the effectiveness of schemes \nis also highlighted. \n \nKeywords: Household waste; waste reduction; waste diversion; economic \ninstruments; regulatory instruments; incentivisation \n \n1. Introduction \nWaste is generated by activities in all economic sectors and often indicates the \ninefficient use of natural resources (Phillips et al., 2001), loss of materials and energy \n 3\nin production processes and unsustainable consumption patterns (EEA, 2002). \nCurrently in England 67% of municipal solid waste (MSW) generated is landfilled, \n9% incinerated and 23.5% recycled or composted (DEFRA, 2006). Results of the \nlatest survey show that in England 29.7 million tonnes of MSW was produced during \n2004\/05, which was 2.1% more than that produced in 2003\/04. However, the average \nannual MSW increase in England is 1.5% from 2000\/01 to 2004\/05. Out of this, 25.7 \nmillion tonnes (about 86%) was from households alone (DEFRA, 2006). It has been \nreported that the amount of total household waste and per capita waste increased by \naround 15% and 12%, respectively, between 1996-97 and 2002-03 (EEA, 2005). \nHowever, no further increase in the household waste production was observed until \n2004-05 (DEFRA, 2006). Household waste is mainly comprised of paper and card, \nkitchen and garden waste. The Waste Strategy 2000 set MSW recycling or \ncomposting targets at 33% by 2015 (DETR, 2000). Also, in the UK, the EU Landfill \nDirective (1999\/31\/EC) requires the reduction in biodegradable municipal waste to \n75% of the 1995 disposal level by year 2010 and 35% reduction by 2020. Therefore, \nEngland requires more sustainable and practicable waste management methods to \ncomply with the EU Landfill Directive. A universal waste hierarchy is suggested for \ndeveloping a sustainable waste management strategy, the elements of which include \nprevention, reuse, recycle, recover and finally disposal in landfills (Fiorucci et al., \n2003). \n \nContinuous rise in waste quantities is imposing economic and environmental costs on \nsociety in most of the European countries for its management (EEA, 2000). The \nincrease in the amount of waste is mainly attributed to the inability of member states \nto decouple economic growth from waste growth. According to European \n 4\nEnvironment Agency report (EEA, 2002), only Germany, the Netherlands, Iceland, \nand to a lesser extent Sweden and Denmark, have been successful in decoupling \neconomic growth and growth in waste production. This decoupling is an objective of \nthe 6th Environment Action Programme (2001-2010) (Gervais, 2002). \n \nIn Europe, the implementation of the waste hierarchy has become difficult due to \ncomplexity and multidisciplinary problems involving social, economic, environmental \nand technical aspects (Philips, et al. 2001). However, laws have been established by \ngovernments at international, national, regional and local levels to facilitate the \nestablishment of challenging targets and to ensure a more sustainable approach to \nwaste management in which less waste is produced and more waste is either reused or \nvalue recovered from it. As a result, the use of household waste management schemes \nhas become widely acceptable for effective waste management towards the top of the \nwaste management hierarchy, i.e. waste reduction. \n \nSeveral schemes based on economic, regulatory and incentive instruments have been \nsuccessfully used in Europe to manage municipal waste (INFORM, 2005; Eunomia, \n2002, 2003; Green Alliance, 2002; Dungan, 2003). Economic instruments refer to \nschemes established based on variable charging in order to implement the polluter \npays principle. In these schemes, the local authorities (LAs) charge fees from \nhouseholders for managing their waste. Regulatory instruments refer to the laws or \nregulations that are introduced by governments in order to enable the LAs to use them \nin the establishment of schemes. Incentive based instruments refer to schemes in \nwhich LAs provide some financial assistance or other ways to encourage \nhouseholders to participate in waste management. The performance of the schemes in \n 5\ndifferent countries varies depending on the social, economic, political and physical \nconditions of the areas.  \nIn the present study, the focus is on the reduction of household waste in England \nusing economic, regulatory and incentive based instruments that have already been \nused in Europe to implement strategies by LAs in order to address the waste issue. So \nthis paper reviews household waste management schemes implemented in Europe, \nassesses their effectiveness in achieving the set targets and considers their replicability \nin England. \n  \n2.  Materials and methods  \n2.1 Procedure and selection of selected schemes \n \nTo review household waste reduction schemes, a method for selecting the schemes \nwas required. Schemes were selected after extensive literature review and consultation \nwith the Environment Agency (EA). However, most of the studies were taken from \ntwo Eunomia reports (Eunomia 2002, 2003). The most relevant schemes from Europe \nwere chosen as they share a number of common features. For example, EU Member \nStates have to comply with common legislation on waste management such as the \npackaging directive. It was expected that Member States would provide a wide range \nof credible data for good analysis and comparison. It was ensured that selected \nschemes cut across the principal instruments (economic, regulatory and incentivised) \nused for the implementation of waste management schemes.  \n \nAfter a comprehensive literature review, the following fifteen household waste \nmanagement schemes were selected for our study: \n 6\n1.  Belgium: Pay-Per-Bag scheme (Eunomia, 2002, 2003) \n2.  Denmark: Weight-based charging scheme (Eunomia, 2002, 2003) \n3.  Germany: Weight-and volume-based system (Eunomia, 2002) \n4.  Italy: Tagged bag scheme (Eunomia, 2003) \n5.  Luxemburg: Combined volume and weight-based scheme (Eunomia, 2002, 2003) \n6.  Sweden: Weight-based scheme (Eunomia, 2002) \n7.  Ireland: Plastic bag environmental levy (Dungan, 2003) \n8.  Germany:  MSW management scheme (INFORM, 2005) \n9.  Belgium: BEBAT scheme for battery collection (Eunomia, 2003) \n10. Finland: Paper collection scheme (Eunomia, 2002) \n11. Belgium: Brussels scheme for the management of waste paper and board \n(Eunomia, 2002) \n12. Netherlands: Paper and fibre collection (Eunomia, 2002) \n13. Belgium: Flanders MSW management (Green Alliance, 2002; Eunomia, 2002) \n14. Sweden: Home composting scheme (Eunomia, 2002) \n15. United Kingdom: West Sussex \u2018Real Nappy\u2019 initiative (Eunomia, 2003). \n \n2.2. Review of schemes \nA preliminary review was performed during an extensive literature survey for all \nselected 15 schemes. During the survey, the important issues in the schemes were \nidentified and critically examined. These include the methodology of establishing the \nscheme (i.e., data gathering on waste arising, quantities, number of households to be \nserved etc.), the operational and administrative requirements of the scheme, the \ntargets set to be achieved, the level of target actually achieved and the time period \nwithin which the achievement of the set target was desired. The limitations of each \n 7\nscheme were highlighted, and the effectiveness and replicability of each scheme were \nconsidered on the basis of observations.  \n \nFor a more detailed review of the 15 schemes, the data was normalised in order to \ncompare and assess the effectiveness of the schemes.   \n \n2.3 Assessment of the effectiveness of schemes \nThe effectiveness of schemes is an essential aspect of this study. To appropriately \ncomment on the effectiveness of the schemes, criteria were developed using \nachievement, time and costs as basic parameters. \n \nAchievement of each scheme was judged based on the total quantity of waste reduced \nor diverted. Figures provided were normalised to waste kg\/cap\/yr for better \nunderstanding and ease of analysis and comparison. Waste reduction or diversion was \nscored based on performance as presented in Table 1. The quantities of waste for \ndiversion are higher than those of reduction because household waste diversion, \nwhich is largely achieved through recycling and composting, is more easily achieved \nthan reduction at source. Skumatz (2000) observed that source reduction schemes \nhave attracted less attention than recycling because source reduction is difficult to \nachieve, difficult to quantify, can be tedious and can be data intensive. \n \nTime refers to the period expected to achieve the set targets by the scheme. This is \nconsidered as an important parameter for assessing the effectiveness of schemes \nbecause programmes are time bound, otherwise they could be unnecessarily expensive \nto achieve the goals. Therefore, weighted scores were also allotted to time taken to \n 8\nreduce or divert a certain quantity of waste, which is shown in Table 2. For the 15 \ncase studies, the score points also differ in respect of reduction and diversion due to \nsimilar reasons as for the case of achievement.  \n \nThe cost of schemes (capital and operational) is the third parameter considered for \nassessing the effectiveness of a scheme. Although this parameter is important in \nassessing effectiveness, it was not possible to develop a criterion for costing the \nschemes due to the following reasons: (a) great variations amongst countries in the \nways household wastes management schemes are designed and managed. For \ninstance, costs for kerbside waste collection will greatly differ from drop off or take \nback methods for recycling schemes, (b) the administrative and operational costs for \nrunning schemes could be hugely different from one country to another due to the \ntechnical requirements for operating the schemes, for example, the lock gate scheme \nin Germany, which was described as technically cumbersome and (c) lack of data on \ncost of schemes; of the fifteen schemes only the German lock gate scheme provided \nany cost data, in the form of total equipment cost without regard to operational and \nadministrative costs. \n \nDue to the constraints above, the assessment of selected schemes on a cost basis was \nnot viable. This is a limitation of the assessment. The assessment of the effectiveness \nof the scheme was therefore limited to two parameters, that is, achievement in terms \nof the quantity of waste reduced or diverted and the time it takes to achieve set targets. \nThe criteria for ranking the schemes are shown in Table 3. \n  \n2.4 Applicability of schemes to England \n 9\nTo determine the replicability of the schemes reviewed in England, a criterion was \ndeveloped using effectiveness of schemes, ease of operation, compatibility with \ngovernment policies and public acceptability as key parameters. Each parameter was \nscored with a maximum of 5 points. The following three categories of replicability \nwere proposed: (a) readily replicable (R) schemes, that are in harmony with the above \nparameters, which do not require any modifications to be implemented (16-20), (b) \nmodified (M) schemes, that will require some modification to enable them to be \nreplicated, due to non conformity with some of the parameters (11-15) and (c) \ndifficult (D) scheme, which refers to schemes that will be extremely difficult to be \nadopted with respect to the scheme\u2019s non-conformity with government policy and \neffectiveness parameters (5-10). \n \n3. Results \n3.1 Detailed review \nA summary of the selected 15 schemes reviewed is presented in Table 4. It essentially \nindicates that three instruments (economic, regulatory and incentive based) are widely \nused in establishing household waste management schemes. Out of the 15 schemes, 7 \nschemes were established using economic instruments, 6 using regulatory instruments \nand 2 schemes were established based on householder incentivisation.  \n \n3.1.1. Performance of schemes based on amount of waste reduced or diverted \nAssessing the performance of the schemes with regards to the amount of waste \nreduction or diversion is one of the key objectives of this study. However, only 4 out \nof the 15 schemes could be compared based on performance because the 4 schemes \nprovided data on clear targets and achievements in similar units or in units that were \n 10\nagreeable after conversion. In the remaining schemes data were either provided for \nachievements or targets only, and in some instances, in percentages without actual \nvalues to allow conversions. The results presented in Fig. 1 indicate that waste \nreduction\/diversion rate of up to 95 kg\/cap\/yr was achieved in the case of a paper \nrecovery scheme in Finland. The results also indicate that set targets were actually \nexceeded by two schemes, the Belgian MSW diversion scheme (target 35 kg\/cap\/yr; \nachieved 40 kg\/cap\/yr) and the Irish plastic bag scheme (target 2 kg\/cap\/yr; achieved \n4 kg\/cap\/yr). In the remaining schemes although targets were not fully achieved, \nperformances ranged from 53 to 67%. The actual quantity of waste reduced or \ndiverted \/ kg\/cap\/yr is shown in Table 5. The results also showed that the quantities of \nwastes reduced or diverted by the schemes range from 4 kg\/cap\/yr in the Irish plastic \nbag scheme to 1600 kg\/family\/yr in the West Sussex real nappy scheme. The amount \nseems small after normalisation by comparing the quantity achieved by the scheme \nwith various per capita waste generation of the country where the schemes are \nimplemented. Thus performances after normalisation range between 0.01 to 5 \nkg\/cap\/yr. \n \nIt is observed that the performances differ greatly between schemes due to the \ndifferent waste streams handled by schemes and whether the goal of the scheme was \nwaste reduction or diversion. \n \n3.1.2. Performance of economic instruments based schemes \nThe performance of 6 out of the 7 schemes based on economic instruments was \ncompared. The results obtained are presented in Table 5. The Danish weight-based \nMSW scheme achieved a diversion rate of up to 120 kg\/cap\/yr (0.2 kg\/cap\/yr, \n 11\nnormalised) whilst the Irish plastic bag levy scheme achieved a 4 kg\/cap\/yr (0.01 \nkg\/cap\/yr, normalised) reduction rate. On average, the economic instrument based \nschemes achieved reduction\/diversion rates of 43 kg\/cap\/yr of the targets they were \nset to achieve. However, the average achieved in terms of actual waste reduction was \nnot normalised because of the differences in the per capita waste production of the \ncountries.  \n \n3.1.3. Performance of regulatory instruments based schemes \nAchievement results of the schemes established using regulatory instruments indicate \nthat the amount of waste reduced or diverted by the schemes are 40 and 95 kg\/cap\/yr \nfor Belgium (MSW Flanders scheme) and Finland, respectively. Table 5 shows the \nachievement of these two schemes that provided data on their targets.  \n \n3.1.4. Performance of incentivised schemes \nTwo schemes in the 15 case studies were based on provision of incentives to \nhouseholders in order to encourage them to participate in waste management schemes. \nThe schemes include the Swedish household composting and the West Sussex real \nnappy scheme in the UK. \n \nThe Swedish households using the scheme, composted an estimated quantity of 1600 \ntonnes\/yr of food wastes, this reduced the amount of waste going to landfill by about \n6 kg\/cap\/yr (0.01 kg\/cap\/yr, normalised) in communities where the scheme was used \n(Table 5). Households that have installed composting facilities within their area were \nqualified to apply for a reduction in waste fees. In the year 2000, the total fee \nreduction (incentive) to households corresponds to \u20ac211,111\/yr (~ \u00a3131,944) or \n 12\n\u20ac133.3\/household\/yr (~ \u00a383.30). The West Sussex real nappy scheme provides free \nlaundry services for families using the scheme. The results of the scheme show that \n500 families participated in the scheme between 1999 and 2000 and this saved the \nproduction of 800 tonnes of disposable nappies as well as cost savings of \u20ac32,000 (~ \n\u00a320,000) for the local authority. The waste reduction per family that used the scheme \ntranslated to 1600 kg \/family\/yr and the incentive provided amounted to \u20ac48\/family\/yr \n(~ \u00a330). \n \n3.2. Assessment of the effectiveness of schemes \nAssessment of the effectiveness of schemes was the major objective of the present \nstudy. Three parameters considered for developing the criterion for assessing the \neffectiveness of the schemes were achievement, time and total costs of schemes as \nexplained in section 2.3. The schemes were categorised in to three groups based on \nthe instruments used for establishing them to allow for comparison of the \neffectiveness between the schemes and to explain the differences observed in the \ndiscussion section. The assessment was categorised as good, fair or poor based on \ntheir scores. The results of the effectiveness are presented in the following sections. \n \n3.2.1. Effectiveness of economic instrument schemes \nThe results of the assessment of the effectiveness of the economic instrument based \nschemes is presented in Table 6. Within the confines of the assessment criterion used, \nthe results indicate that two of the schemes (Ireland and Denmark) were ranked as \ngood, and the remaining four were rated as fair (Belgium, Luxemburg, Italy and \nSweden). The remaining scheme from Germany in this category was not rated due to \na lack of data.    \n 13\n3.2.2. Effectiveness of regulatory instrument schemes \nThe results of the assessment of the effectiveness of the schemes established based on \nregulatory instruments are presented in Table 7. Within the limits of the criterion \nused, the results indicate that the paper recovery scheme from Finland was the most \neffective and ranked as good. Three other schemes were rated as fairly effective \nwhilst two schemes were not rated due to insufficient information.  \n \n3.2.3 Effectiveness of incentivised schemes \nThe results of the assessment of the effectiveness of the incentivised schemes are \npresented in Table 8. The results indicate that the Swedish household composting \nscheme was rated as fairly effective based on the criterion used whilst the real nappy \nscheme was rated as good.        \n \n3.3. Assessment of the applicability of schemes in England \nThe potential replicability of the reviewed schemes in England was a key objective of \nour study. As a result, a criterion for determining the replicability was developed \nusing compatibility with government policies (particularly on variable charging) as a \nmajor parameter, with effectiveness of scheme, public acceptability and ease of \noperation and administration being complementary parameters, as discussed in section \n2.4. The results presented in Table 9 show that only four of the 15 schemes could be \nreadily replicated in England, out of which three schemes are regulatory and one is \nincentive based. Further analysis shows that 6 out of the 15 schemes would require \nmodifications in order to be replicated in England (2 schemes are economic, 3 are \nregulatory based and 1 is incentive based). The results also indicate that 5 (all are \n 14\neconomic instrument based) out of the 15 schemes would be difficult to replicate in \nEngland.  \n \n4. Discussion \n4.1. Performance of economic instrument schemes  \nEconomic instruments are essentially based on the polluter pays principle, which puts \nthe responsibility of waste management on the producer of waste, in this case, the \nhouseholders. The instrument is known by different names in different countries such \nas the variable charging, unit-based pricing, pay-as-you-throw, etc. The variable \ncharging system could be based on weight, volume or weight and volume. \n \nAs could be seen in this review, 7 of the 15 reviewed schemes were established using \neconomic instruments based on variable charging. The use of economic instruments to \nestablish waste management schemes in Europe is well accepted and it is used in \nBelgium, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden, Spain, etc. The results in Table 5 show \nthat the Danish MSW and Irish plastic bag schemes both established under the \nvariable charging system have made significant MSW reduction and diversion \nrespectively.  The Danish scheme diverted 120 kg\/cap\/yr of MSW, which translates to \n0.2 kg\/cap\/yr of the actual reduction when compared with the Danish per capita waste \nproduction of 530 kg\/cap\/yr, and the Irish scheme reduced 4 kg\/cap\/yr of plastic bag \nwaste, which translates to 0.01 kg\/cap\/yr, when compared with the Irish per capita \nMSW production. In the 6 schemes, which provided data, the use of economic \ninstruments made a significant reduction or diversion of MSW. The reason for the \nincreasing popularity of variable charging is the economic incentive of having to pay \nfor waste management by the amount generated which rewards recyclers and which \n 15\nhas caused a subsequent reduction in tonnes of waste in communities where the \ninstrument is used. This is in consensus with the views of Shapiro (1995) that the \nvariable charging system provides a direct economic incentive for people to prevent \nwaste generation, to recycle and to compost. \n \nA survey of LAs to assess attitudes towards direct charging of householders for waste \nmanagement services suggests that existing legislation does not permit LAs to use \nvariable charging schemes (Eunomia, 2003). The report identified direct charging \nbarriers and mechanisms for increasing recycling through household participation. \nThe public may not welcome the variable charging method because of the general \nbelief that waste collection is already paid for through the council tax (Price, 2001; \nRayner, 2003). Government has ruled out charging schemes for the foreseeable future \ndespite considerable analysis (Ernst & Young, 2002) but such schemes have not been \nruled out altogether. The Government has however ruled out a separate national tax \non household waste (HM Treasury, 2003) which is an alternative option. The Local \nGovernment Association (2004) is lobbying Government to give power to councils to \nimplement direct and variable charging schemes. Despite existing legislation, LAs are \nable to charge for excess waste by restricting the size of containers they provide. In \nthis manner, home composting can also be encouraged and waste production can be \nsignificantly reduced. The House of Commons Environment Food and Rural Affairs \nCommittee (2003, 2005) is strongly in favour of LAs being given the ability to \nintroduce variable charging schemes if they so wish but argues that they should only \nbe introduced if they do not have an unfair impact, especially on low income families. \nPotentially, direct charging could reward those households that produce less waste. \n \n 16\nHowever, in England, kerbside collection is increasing under the provisions of the \nHousehold Waste Recycling Act 2003 that aims to increase the amount of recyclables \nto meet the prescribed targets (DEFRA, 2005). English waste collection authorities \nare to collect separately at least two types of recyclables at the kerbside from all \nhouseholds by 2015 at reasonable cost. Under the act, materials recycling facilities \n(MRFs) are not an acceptable alternative for the separate collection of two different \ntypes of recyclables. In order to comply with the act, direct charging can be \nimplemented for excess waste. Some EU member states are already performing \nsignificantly better than England, for example Austria collected >65% and the \nNetherlands and Germany both around 40% of all MSW as separate waste fractions in \n1999 (European Commission, 2003). Householder charging is much the most widely \nused instrument to influence waste generation and reductions in residual waste \n(Resource Recovery Forum, 2004). \n \n4.2. Performance of regulatory instrument schemes \nRegulatory policy is an instrument based on legislation introduced by countries in \norder to address waste problems. In most cases, some form of legislation is required to \nforce the implementation of a waste management scheme. The result of this study \nshows (in Table 4) that 6 of the schemes reviewed were established using regulatory \ninstruments. It is evident from the study that regulatory instruments can successfully \nbe used to address the generic MSW problem. However, most of the regulatory \ninstrument schemes were assessed for specific waste streams.  \n \n 17\nWithin the limitations of the criterion used for assessing the effectiveness of the \nschemes, there seems to be no significant difference in achievements between the \nregulatory based schemes.  \n \nAll six regulatory-based schemes were established through producer responsibility \nwith respect to household wastes. For instance, the 1993 Belgian law of ecotaxes \naimed to give incentives to consumers to change their behaviour towards product \nconsumption in an environmentally friendly way. In order to achieve this, a tax was \nimposed on a range of products to be sold. Therefore, the BEBAT scheme was \nintroduced to collect used dry batteries for subsequent recycling. The batteries are \nexempt from ecotax if the manufacturers agree to set up a recycling and collection \nscheme. The paper schemes of Finland and the Netherlands targeted waste paper \ncollection from households. In the Netherlands scheme, local authorities are \nresponsible for collecting paper and board from the household. The paper industry \nthen purchases this material from LAs and it pays for further processing and disposal. \nAll the schemes were implemented through producer responsibility. The main reason \nfor the participation of industries in household waste schemes may be attributed to the \nimposition of tax on certain products. An increased price due to tax might bring a \nchange in public perception towards the use of products. This may eventually reduce \nthe market of such products.  \n \nGood performance of most regulatory schemes is observed as it is easier to identify, \nseparate and collect the specific waste streams. Also, breach of legislation may result \nin prosecution to the waste collectors and producers (Green Alliance, 2002). \n 18\n \n4.3. Incentivised schemes \nIncentivised instruments are essentially based on the provision of incentives in cash or \nkind by waste management authorities to householders who participate in schemes. \nTwo of the reviewed case studies were established based on the provision of \nincentives to householders who wish to participate in waste management schemes \nimplemented by LAs. The results of the use of incentives to address household waste \nshow a dramatic performance by the West Sussex real nappy scheme, which reduced \nat source 1600 kg\/family\/yr (Eunomia, 2003). The use of incentive schemes also \nachieved some diversion of ca. 6 kg\/cap\/yr of household waste to landfill in Sweden, \nwhich translates to 0.01kg\/cap\/yr, when compared to the Swedish 530 kg per capita \nwaste generation. The performance of the two schemes was surprising because \nincentivised schemes do not seem to perform so well in reality. This is because the \nchoice to participate in the scheme is entirely the decision of the householders, who \ndespite the incentives on offer, may not feel comfortable to participate in recycling or \ncomposting of their waste. This is supported by Rayner (2003), who demonstrated in a \nnewspaper survey report that some UK residents \u201cavoided the recycling route by \ncontinuing to put everything in one bin for the general rubbish\u201d, their argument being \nthat they have paid for waste management and could not understand why they should \nbe involved. \n \nThe reason for the good performance of the two incentive-based schemes in West \nSussex could be because they targeted specific waste streams and the wide publicity \nenjoyed by the scheme. This is supported by the fact that most of the schemes that \naddressed specific waste streams have significantly reduced or diverted waste, for \n 19\nexample as seen in the case of plastic bags in Ireland, battery collection and recycling \nin Belgium and paper recovery in Finland. \n \n4.4. Effectiveness of schemes \nThe criteria used for assessing the effectiveness of the schemes have already been \npresented in detail in section 2.3.  \n \n4.4.1. Effectiveness of the economic instruments based schemes \nThe results of the assessment of the effectiveness of schemes based on economic \ninstruments are presented in Table 6. The reason for the good performance of the Irish \nand Danish schemes is that both targeted specific waste streams (plastic bags and \nhousehold composting) which make it easier for the householders and the operators to \nmanage than total MSW that might require sorting before treatment or disposal. An \nadditional reason for the effectiveness of the Irish plastic bag scheme is probably the \ncharge of \u20ac6.7\/kg (~ \u00a34.20) which is higher than all other charging schemes reviewed. \nThis cost might have been responsible for the change of people\u2019s behaviour, which is \na greater challenge to waste reduction (Grigg and Read, 2001).  \n \n4.4.2. Effectiveness of the regulatory instruments  \nThe results of the effectiveness of the regulatory instrument based schemes are \npresented in Table 7. Using our criteria, only the Finland paper recovery scheme was \nrated as effectively good. The reason for this is probably twofold; firstly there is a \nlong demand-lead history of paper recycling in Finland dating back to the 1940s; and \nsecondly due to the involvement of the most experienced paper company in Finland \n(Paperinkerays Ltd), in the scheme, whose responsibility is to collect and recover \n 20\nwaste paper from households and offices. Paperinkerays maintains an information \nsystem pertaining to waste paper operations. The success of the scheme is also \nattributable to involvement of property owners in waste paper collection. Property \nowners were responsible for the provision of containers and collection of waste paper. \nThree of the schemes were rated as fairly effective and the other two could not be \nassessed due to lack of data. The effectiveness of the schemes could be attributable to \nbeing waste stream specific e.g. the battery and waste paper and board schemes in \nBelgium and the paper recovery schemes in Finland and the Netherlands, possibly due \nto ease of identification and handling. Another reason is that under producer \nresponsibility, there don\u2019t seem to be financial constraints for the operation of \nschemes and possible monitoring by government to ensure compliance. In the \nproducer responsibility schemes reported in the literature, there are proper \narrangements for financing the schemes by the stakeholders and all of them become \nobliged.  \n \n4.4.3. Effectiveness of incentivised schemes \nThe Swedish household food composting scheme was rated as fairly effective whilst \nthe West Sussex real nappy scheme was rated as good. The reason for the \neffectiveness of the West Sussex real nappy scheme is the intensive campaigning and \nthe assistance by hospitals, health officers, the local media, and increasing support \nfrom householders. Another possible reason for effectiveness could be the need to \nprotect babies from rashes due to poor ventilation caused by the plastic content of \nnon-real nappies.  \n 21\n \n4.5. Applicability of schemes in England  \nThe result of the assessment of the potential replicability of schemes in England \nshows that only 6 of the reviewed schemes could be directly replicated in England \n(Table 9). This is because the schemes were implemented using the producer \nresponsibility that is already well established in the UK through the Environment Act \n1995. The two other schemes that could be readily replicated were established based \non the provision of incentives, which is a widely accepted method of implementing \nschemes in the UK. The real nappy scheme is a good example of an incentive-based \nscheme in the UK. \n \nThe results further suggest that 10 of the 15 schemes could be replicated in England \nwith some modification. Most of these schemes were based on the variable charging \nsystem, which is not currently permitted in England. Some schemes, although not \nbased on variable charging, would need modification because they employ fines of up \nto $10,000 per day (~ \u00a35,600) on any county that fails to comply with the recycling \ntargets (Green Alliance, 2002). These measures are not popular in Europe and would \nnot be readily accepted in England. \n \n5. Conclusions \nHousehold waste management schemes adopt economic, regulatory or incentive based \ninstruments that are widely acceptable across Europe. Many such schemes have been \nsuccessful in achieving waste reduction. In the absence of a standardised method of \nmeasuring effectiveness of schemes, the quality of assessing the effectiveness of \nschemes is within the constraints of our criterion developed. This emphasises the need \n 22\nfor consistent data and in particular the need to standardise the measurement of \neffectiveness. Furthermore, whilst the success of some individual schemes can be \nhighlighted, there is a lack of transparent data on the costs of commissioning, \noperating and monitoring household waste management schemes in relation to their \nwaste reduction or diversion achievements. Schemes that are designed to manage \nspecific waste streams achieve the greatest reduction or diversion, rather than the \ngeneral MSW stream. \n \nAlthough some schemes were found to be highly effective, many cannot be replicated \nin England due to the policy barrier created by the Environmental Protection Act 1990 \nwhich prohibits variable charging by LAs to implement waste management schemes. \nThis suggests the need for central government to review policy with respect to that \nAct. \n \nThe waste paper and board, real nappy and BEBAT schemes provide good potential \nfor achieving waste reduction at household levels. In addition to these, the Belgian \nand German MSW schemes, Irish plastic bag environmental levy scheme, \nNetherlands waste paper scheme and Swedish home composting schemes would \nrequire modifications before possible implementation. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was sponsored by the Environment Agency for which the authors are \ngrateful.
