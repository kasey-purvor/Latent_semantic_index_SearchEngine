Professor Salmon\nplots the development and use of the model, first conceived some 12 years ago, and\nencourages us to reflect further on a model that has been so widely adopted. The\nlongevity of its use in a fast-changing field is testament to its appeal to educators,\ndevelopers and learners. It is clear that a number of ALT-J readers will know of, and\nhave used, the model and may want to express thoughts on its current applicability,\nas Salmon invites.\nIn challenging the model with the proposed \u2018E-learning Ladder\u2019 (Moule, 2006), I\nam also encouraging a discourse about the pedagogy of e-learning at a time when\ntechnology continues to offer great scope for further development through virtual\nlearning environments and Web 2.0 technologies. I believe it is important to encour-\nage academic staff engagement in designing for online pedagogy, although I support\nSalmon\u2019s suggestion that this remains far from easy. Too frequently I encounter\nconcerns relating to an information and communications technology-driven peda-\ngogy, where academics struggle to ensure learning outcomes are met through the\navailable computer technology. These issues are explored in a recent publication\n(Shalnti, 2006), where it is suggested that technological developments, including\nmobile devices, continue to be defined in relation to delivery capability rather than\naccounting for different learning needs.\nThe e-learning ladder presents my construction of a conceptual model that acknowl-\nedges the range of e-learning approaches available to academics and e-learning design-\ners. It shows how learning might be positioned from instructivist through to\nconstructivist, giving examples of the types of e-learning that might be located within.\nThese ladder \u2018rungs\u2019 could be developed further to take account of the range of Web\n2.0 technologies now available, particularly in respect of m-learning. The ladder \u2018sides\u2019\nrepresent a number of the requirements to support e-learning identified through the\nresearch. These I feel might also be enhanced, to include, for example, the role of\ngender in e-learning. It is my intention to develop this through further research and\nuse, and hope that others in the e-learning community will engage in this as well. I\n*University of the West of England, Faculty of Health and Social Care, Blackberry Hill, Stapleton,\nBristol BS16 1DD, UK. Email: pam.moule@uwe.ac.uk\n174 P. Moule\ndeveloped the model to take account of learner diversity and pedagogic innovation.\nIt was my intention that it should support academics and designers in thinking through\nthe learning approach, on an instructivist to constructivist continuum, to identify how\nthe technology could enable achievement. I wait to hear your thoughts and feedback.\nReferences\nMoule, P.
