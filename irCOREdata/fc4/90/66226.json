Among local\nauthorities and local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships, continental-style\n\u2018diversity\u2019 \u2013 in the sense of a broader mix of participants and forms of entertainment \u2013\nhas emerged as an ideal to be strived for. This article examines the problems faced by\nthose attempting to create diversity and with it the \u2018continentalisation\u2019 of the night-time\neconomy in this country.\nI n t roduct ion\nThe analysis here draws upon the author\u2019s research on the night-time economy, and\nattendant problems of crime and disorder, in a number of towns and cities in England and\nWales (Tierney and Hobbs, 2003). Specific reference is made to a subsequent, detailed\nstudy of one particular, and typical, medium-size town centre location: a London borough\nreferred to here as \u2018Boroville\u2019. Whilst a detailed analysis of the data generated by this study\nis not necessary, some findings particularly relevant to the discussion of \u2018diversity\u2019 are\nreferred to. The research covered a ten month period and, focusing on the town centre,\nsought to provide a detailed profile of Boroville\u2019s night-time economy. Both quantitative\ndata (from, for example, the police, the local authority, and the local hospital Accident\nand Emergency Department) and qualitative data (based on, for example, participant\nobservation and semi-structured interviews with participants, bar managers, door staff,\nand others who, in various ways, were involved with the night-time economy), were\ndrawn on.\nThe 2003 Licensing Act introduced a new licensing regime in England and Wales,\nand with it the possibility of greatly extended (even 24 hour) opening hours for licensed\npremises. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport believes that the new legislation,\nfor which it has responsibility, will provide the basis for a transformation in the nature\nof the night-time economy in England and Wales. Thus for local authorities, who\nreplaced magistrates as the licensing authority, and local Crime and Disorder Reduction\nPartnerships (CDRPs), the future development of their evening and night-time town and\ncity centres has become a particularly pressing policy issue. Among local authorities\n(including the one in Boroville) a night-time economy based upon \u2018diversity\u2019 has emerged\nas an ideal to strive for. In this context, diversity is conceptualised in terms of two mutually\nreinforcing components: a diverse mix of participants, and the provision of a diverse range\n453\nJohn Tierney\nof leisure activities. Therefore, and looking across the Channel for inspiration, in some\nfuture, ideal world, we will witness the \u2018continentalisation\u2019 of the night-time economy,\nwhereby it is transformed into a multifaceted, multicultural and safe environment, similar\nto that apparently found in continental Europe. This is a vision of the future shared by\nboth central and local government. As the then minister for Culture, Media and Sport,\nRichard Caborn, put it:\nWe are trying to modernise the system and the industry is with us. We want to be more\nEuropean. (quoted by Levy and Scott-Clark, 2004)\nAnd, in a similar vein, a councillor from Greater Manchester \u2013 where the development of\nthe night-time economy has been particularly successful in economic terms \u2013 has stated:\nI spent time in Berlin over Christmas and was struck by the mixed age groups that use the city\ncentre. Theirs is very much a cafe\u00b4-and-cake culture, and we definitely see that as part of the\nManchester vision. (The Guardian, 2004)\nIt is a tall order, especially in view of the limited extent to which a local authority and\nother interested parties will be able to influence the processes necessary to achieve such\na goal.\nThe n igh t - t ime economy\nA product of public\u2013private partnerships forged between local authorities and a service\nindustry based upon consumption and leisure, the remarkable growth of the night-time\neconomy in this country, together with its profound social, cultural and economic impact,\nhas been documented and analysed in a number of studies (for example, Lovatt et al. 1994;\nZukin, 1995; Hall and Hubbard, 1998; Thomas and Bromley, 2000; Hadfield et al., 2001;\nChatterton and Hollands, 2002; Monaghan, 2002; Hobbs et al., 2003). It is an economy\ncharacterised by three obvious features. Firstly, it is based upon the consumption of\nalcohol, often in large quantities; a market where, as Hobbs (2002: 59) puts it: \u2018consumers\nare encouraged to become inebriated\u2019. Secondly, it is primarily oriented towards younger\npeople aged 18 to 35, reflecting the success of the marketing strategies introduced by the\nbrewing industry over the last quarter of a century, and aimed explicitly at younger, male\nand female, drinkers. And, thirdly, it is a market concentrated in town and city centre\nentertainment zones.\nProb lems\nThe development of a thriving night-time economy has clearly brought with it a range\nof economic and other benefits, spectacularly so in the case of certain locations, where\nregeneration and re-branding have been highly successful. However, across the country\nlocal authorities and CDRPs have become increasingly concerned about the negative\naspects. A large body of research has shown that there are significant costs in the shape\nof crime, disorder and \u2018quality of life\u2019 issues, such as street fouling and noise (Hutchinson\net al., 1998; Lister et al., 2000; Tierney and Hobbs, 2003; Home Office, 2004a). While\n454\nThe 2003 Licensing Act and Britain\u2019s Night-Time Economy\ndata on alcohol-related crime and disorder did not show that Boroville town centre was\nan especially dangerous place when compared with other, similar locations, there were\nthe inevitable and familiar alcohol-related problems, ranging from assaults to low-level\nforms of disorderly behaviour. The most recent annual recorded crime figures showed\nthat 45 per cent of all crime incidents in the town centre during the night\/early morning\nwere in the category of violence against the person, compared with 23 per cent for the\nborough as a whole. Levels of violence against the person and criminal damage in the\ntown centre peaked on Friday and Saturday nights, and 40 per cent of all violence against\nthe person offences occurred within 50 metres of a drinking venue.\nThe arrival of a new, liberalised licensing regime has sharpened concerns among\npolicy makers over how best to respond to the largely unanticipated consequences of a\nprocess that began around 25 years ago. It is within this context that diversity, as defined\nabove, has emerged as an important gaol. The central question, though, is the extent\nto which diversity can be achieved, given the existing social, cultural and economic\ndynamics of the night-time economy in this country.\nAch iev ing d ive rs i t y\nA mix o f pa r t i c i pan t s\nThe research in Boroville found that a significant proportion of older residents and\ncouples with children avoided visiting the town centre during the evening and night-\ntime, especially at weekends. Aggregating the figures for one Friday and Saturday night,\nshowed that nearly 80 per cent of drinkers in the town centre pubs and bars were aged\n18 to 35, and only 3.2 per cent were aged 50 and over. Non-participation was linked to\nconcerns about crime, disorderly behaviour and personal safety, and as well to the lack of\nalternatives to youth-oriented licensed premises. This is congruent with the findings from\nresearch in other parts of the country (for example, Thomas and Bromley, 2000; Tierney\nand Hobbs, 2003). One important qualification to this is that discussions of diversity\ntend to be predicated on the assumption that the night-time economy, as it is presently\nconstituted, appeals to and attracts virtually all of the local young people. In other words,\nthat the pool of non-participants for whom the town is in effect a \u2018no-go\u2019 area at certain\ntimes, is made up exclusively of older people and couples with children. However, as\nChatterton and Hollands (2002) point out in their research in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, some\ngroups of young people are, for financial or cultural reasons, themselves non-participants.\nHistorically, local responses to problems associated with alcohol consumption and\nthe night-time economy have been grounded in attempts to manage risk by introducing\nvarious community safety initiatives. These initiatives have focused on licensed premises,\nthe street, transportation, offenders and various campaigns, such as the promotion of\n\u2018sensible\u2019 drinking and alerting customers to the dangers of \u2018spiked\u2019 drinks (Shepherd,\n1994; Plant, Single and Stockwell, 1997; Home Office, 2004b). Taken as a whole,\nthey amount to a huge compendium of possibilities. However, where successful, these\ninitiatives have functioned primarily to make town centres safer for existing \u2018typical\u2019\nparticipants in the night-time economy. Any hoped for spin-off in terms of encouraging\nolder clientele and families to rub shoulders with young weekend revellers has tended\nnot to materialise. Thus, whilst creating a safer environment for young participants is\nobviously to be applauded, on its own this will not create diversity. From the point of\n455\nJohn Tierney\nview of the local authority, the police and town centre businesses in Boroville, \u2018negative\nperceptions\u2019 among some sections of the local population were the principle reason\nfor their non-participation in the night-time economy. However, a common view was\nthat these perceptions were not commensurate with the actual risks that people were\nlikely to face. Used in this way, negative perceptions were virtually synonymous with the\nnotion of \u2018fear of crime\u2019, and raise an important issue within the context of debates about\ndiversity. Attempts to measure fear of crime are now one of the staple ingredients of local\naudits of crime and disorder, and these audits frequently emphasise that such fears are\nnot commensurate with the risks of being a crime victim (for critical discussions of the\nconcept of fear of crime see Walklate, 1998; Lee, 2001). Indeed, the latest crime and\ndisorder audit for Boroville stated that:\nThe recent increase in fear of crime reported by Boroville residents is understood, although\nconsidered disproportionate to the actual risk.\nIf policy makers believe that the fear of crime is disproportionate to the actual risks, the\ncorollary of this is that the actual risks equate with \u2018reality\u2019 and the fear of crime equates\nwith an \u2018incorrect\u2019 perception. Furthermore, such a belief is based upon the dubious\nassumption that each of these can be quantified \u2013 if they cannot be quantified, then how\ncan it be established that fears are disproportionate? Although the auditing process may\nhave a surface appearance of being guided by actuarial, \u2018objective\u2019 principles, in practice\nit is often infused with commonsense judgements (Moore, 2000). In the case of a specific\ntown centre and its night-time economy, measuring so-called \u2018actual\u2019 risks associated with\nalcohol-related crime and disorder, and then assessing the degree of congruency between\nthese and people\u2019s negative perceptions are fraught with difficulties. It has to be recognised\nthat an individual\u2019s perception of risk is real for them. Therefore, it is misleading to view\nthese negative perceptions as irrational, and on that basis assume that the task is simply one\nof replacing these with \u2018rational\u2019 perceptions. Even if non-participants had an opportunity\nto experience the night-time economy at first hand \u2013 which, from the perspective of many\nof those we interviewed, should help reduce the gap between \u2018negative perception\u2019 and\n\u2018reality\u2019 \u2013 it does not necessarily follow that they would then wish to participate. For\nsome, their experiences might turn out to be worse than they anticipated. The process\nof judging how \u2018bad\u2019 things are (and this applies to statutory authorities as well as the\nlocal community) has, at its core, different and competing understandings, sensitivities\nand tolerance thresholds. The problem is that debates on this theme tend to conflate what\nare, in fact, two different dimensions: (i) an individual\u2019s perception of what occurs, and\n(ii) that individual\u2019s degree of concern based upon that perception.\nThe issue can be pursued further by viewing the problems associated with the night-\ntime economy in terms of a spectrum of types and amounts of behaviour, ranging from\n(at the \u2018low\u2019 end) boisterousness, through \u2018bad\u2019 language and urinating in the street, to (at\nthe \u2018high\u2019 end) serious assaults. Among the representatives of the local authority, police\nand local businesses that we interviewed in Boroville, the assumption was that non-\nparticipants (earmarked as the source of diversity in the future) perceived the problems to\nbe located at the \u2018high\u2019 end of the spectrum, when in reality they lay towards the \u2018low\u2019\nend. Thus the crucial task was to disabuse them of this negative perception. However,\nfrom the point of view of many non-participants, even the behaviours located at the\n456\nThe 2003 Licensing Act and Britain\u2019s Night-Time Economy\n\u2018low\u2019 end are likely to be unacceptable: in other words, the normal behaviour associated\nwith young people who have consumed large amounts of alcohol, behaviour routinely\nreplicated across the country. For many older residents in Boroville, one straightforward\ndisincentive to participate in the night-time economy at the weekend is that they will be\nsharing the experience with large numbers of inebriated young men and women.\nIn all discussions of future diversity in Boroville, there was no suggestion that it would\nnecessitate the de facto exclusion of some current participants; the implicit assumption\nwas that diversity involved an overall increase in participants. This view is congruent\nwith that expressed a decade ago in Department of the Environment Circular 5\/94, where\nit was argued that increasing the numbers and age ranges of people visiting a town\nor city centre during the evening and night-time would help prevent crime because of\n\u2018crowding out\u2019 and \u2018animation\u2019 (again, the imagery is drawn from continental Europe).\nWhilst the realisation of a much more inclusive and diverse local night-time economy\nis, from the perspective of local authorities, the police and central government, a highly\ndesirable goal, within a specifically British context, diversity may itself create new sorts\nof problems. This is especially the case with smaller town centres, where there is limited\nscope for zonal diversity based upon the geographical segregation of different groups and\nleisure experiences. The achievement of diversity in smaller town centres would involve\nan integration, rather than segregation, of different groups. Thus older and younger people\n(including young people looking for a quiet, trouble-free night out), together with couples\nwith children, would be co-participants in the night-time economy. Clearly, this would\ntransform its present monocultural nature, and for many would represent an ideal future.\nHowever, a heavy drinking culture and the disorderly behaviour associated with it will\nnot disappear overnight. As a result, this situation might easily generate new sources of\nconflict based upon, for example, older people and parents of young children objecting\nto \u2018bad\u2019 language or young men urinating in the street.\nA d i ve r se range o f l e i su r e ac t i v i t i e s\nEnticing non-participants to become participants in the night-time economy is obviously\ncontingent upon appropriate alcohol-led, as well as non-alcohol-led, activities being on\noffer. Basically, such activities fall into four categories:\n\u2022 Pubs or bars that are not dominated by younger drinkers.\n\u2022 Licensed or non-licensed premises providing a variety of specialised entertainment,\nsuch as different types of live music.\n\u2022 Restaurants and \u2018continental style\u2019 cafe\u00b4s.\n\u2022 Non-alcohol-led attractions such as museums, cinemas, theatres and sports.\nBoroville\u2019s town centre is fairly typical in that it contains a cinema, theatre and a handful of\nsmall, traditional pubs. The night-time economy, however, is dominated by larger licensed\npremises catering primarily for younger drinkers and, particularly on Friday and Saturday\nnights, the traditional pubs are largely frequented by young drinkers in the early part of the\nevening (because prices are cheaper than in other venues). Restaurants managers and the\nmanager of the theatre reported that there was a drop in business on Friday and Saturday\nevenings. Thus, although there exist some leisure activities that are potentially attractive\nto non-participants, in terms of diversity, they are unable to make a significant impact.\n457\nJohn Tierney\nWithin the local authority and among others arguing for diversity, the solution, as they\nsaw it, lay in the provision of a greater range of suitable alternative venues and activities.\nAs one police officer, for instance, said: \u2018I\u2019d like to see a jazz club in the town centre,\nwhere you can have a drink and listen to live music.\u2019 Essentially, the challenge is one of\naltering existing leisure opportunities and developing new ones. However, entrepreneurs,\nwhether breweries or individuals, will only alter the nature of their existing pubs, bars and\nclubs, or invest in new premises and enterprises, if it is commercially viable. Therefore,\nany debates about the shape of the night-time economy within a particular town centre\nhave, fundamentally, take the market into consideration. In this respect, the omens are\nnot encouraging. The large capacity venues and heavy drinking culture around which the\nnight-time economy is built, generate substantial profits for the breweries and, of course,\nit will be extremely difficult to attract capital investment directed at either different styles\nof licensed premises, or alternative leisure activities. Thus, for instance, whilst a small\nclub providing late-night cabaret would be welcomed by some local residents, from\nthe point of view of profitability, it would hardly compare with a one thousand capacity,\nthemed \u2018vertical drinking bar\u2019. A further dimension to this is the effect that highly profitable\nlicensed premises have on town and city centre rent levels:\nThe market pressures placed upon less profitable, non-alcohol-based businesses such as high\nstreet cinemas, theatres, live music venues, and restaurants, then ensure that they can no longer\nafford to operate in the area, being displaced by additional alcohol-led businesses. (Hobbs\net al., 2003: 247)\nHowever, even if current non-participants were presented with alternative and, to\nthem, attractive activities, coupled with a safe environment, there is no guarantee that\nparticipation rates among these groups will increase significantly. Compared with younger\nand typical participants, the participation of older people and families in the night-time\neconomy is much more contingent upon personal circumstances (for example, stage in\nthe family cycle) and rival attractions (for example, country pubs, dinner parties).\nConc lus ion\nClearly, changes to the licensing regime have important implications for urban social\npolicy and, within that context, notions of inclusion and exclusion, seen here in terms\nof participation and non-participation. The impact of these changes, though, is difficult,\nif not impossible to predict. As far as achieving diversity is concerned, the signs are not\nencouraging: the imperatives of the market, coupled with the limited powers available to\na Licensing Authority, provide little room for manoeuvre. A Licensing Authority cannot,\nfor instance, impose a fixed, or a set of staggered closing times on selected licensed\npremises in a particular area; and only \u2018relevant\u2019 representations, supported by compelling\nevidence, will lead to the refusal of a license application or renewal. However, this is\nnot an argument for policy inertia \u2013 some foundations for the future can be laid now.\nLocal authorities and their CDRPs would benefit from the production of good, routinely\nmonitored, information pertaining to alcohol-related crime and disorder in their town and\ncity centres (for example, based upon their local audits of crime and disorder). At the same\ntime, the rhetoric of \u2018partnership\u2019 could be translated into practice that is more robust\n458\nThe 2003 Licensing Act and Britain\u2019s Night-Time Economy\nif the drinks industry made an appropriate contribution to the policing of the night-time\neconomy, in combination with other community safety initiatives.\nMore pessimistically, although the Department for Culture, Media and Sport sees\nthe 2003 Licensing Act playing a key role in changing the character of the night-time\neconomy, so that it resembles a continental cafe\u00b4 culture model, it is difficult to see how\nthis could be accomplished in the foreseeable future, given its current characteristics. The\nlicensing powers available to local authorities under the terms of the Act are unlikely to\nlead to a transformation of town and city centres, whether from the point of view of the\ntypes of licensed premises operating, the range of alternative, non-alcohol-led activities\navailable, or the age-mix of participants. In practice, the market will continue to play\nthe dominant role. It is a massive leap of faith to believe that under these circumstances\nlocal authorities are in a position to respond to the changes introduced by the new Act\nin such a way that, at least in the medium term, there is a significant shift away from a\nyouth dominated, heavy drinking culture, towards one usually associated with continental\nEurope. This is especially the case when trends in under-age drinking are considered (see,\nfor example, Tierney, 2004, for a discussion of under-18 s discos\/club nights). Proponents\nof the new legislation argue that the introduction of flexible closing times will lead to\nless concentrated, \u2018binge\u2019 drinking and fewer dispersal problems, thereby reducing crime\nand disorder. However, even if this were to occur, it would not necessarily encourage\ndiversity in the sense of a greater mix of participants. As has been argued above, the\nrelatively harmless normal behaviour of large numbers of young drinkers is sufficient to\ndeter wider participation.
