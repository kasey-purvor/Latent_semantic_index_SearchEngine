INTRODUCTION \n \nRenewable energy sources are the second largest contributor to global electricity \nproduction. They accounted for 19% of power generation in 2000, compared with 39% \nfrom coal-fired power plants, 17% from each of nuclear and natural gas-fired power \nplants and 8% from oil-fired power plants [1]. 92% of the electricity generated from \nrenewable energy sources comes from large-scale hydropower stations plants. \nBiomass utilisation schemes contribute 5% towards renewable electricity, with the \nremaining 3% being produced by the utilisation of new renewable sources, i.e. \ngeothermal, solar, wind, wave and tidal energy [1].  \n 2\n \nThere are many drawbacks, however, in the utilisation of new renewable energy \nsources for electricity generation, including [2]: \n \n\u2022 Requirement of large installation because of low energy density \n\u2022 Low controllability and endurance because of the frequent fluctuations \n\u2022 Quantitative and temporal mismatches between demand and supply \n \nTo resolve the problems of dispatching large amounts of variable, intermittent and \nlargely unpredictable renewable electricity to remote areas of a conventional electrical \ngrid, an alternative efficient means of storing and transporting the energy will be \nneeded.  \n \nEnergy storage in the form of chemical compounds is likely to play an important and \nincreasing role. Hydrogen is most promising storage medium due to its excellent \nenergy content to weight ratio and the high conversion efficiencies achievable in its \nproduction (electrolysis) and use (fuel cells). Electrolysers can operate successfully at \nvariable power supply with a typical conversion efficiency of > 85% [3]. Electrolysers \ncan be placed near the source of the renewable-energy generated electricity, avoiding, \ntherefore, the need for transmission line upgrades and preventing flows of power back \nup the distribution network. However, hydrogen produced from water electrolysis is \nrelatively expensive due to the high capital cost of the electrolysis cells. Gaseous \nhydrogen also has the disadvantage of low energy density. The introduction of gaseous \nhydrogen as an energy carrier requires a complete technical and organisational \ninfrastructure for storage, transport, distribution and use. \n \nLiquid energy carriers (i.e. liquid fuels) have great advantages of high energy density \nfor storage and transportation, and the ease of handling. Despite the associated \nconversion efficiency, the conversion of gaseous hydrogen to liquid methanol results in \na more convenient alternative energy carrier that can be handled by the existing \ninfrastructure [4].   \n \n \n2. USE OF METHANOL \n \n \nMethanol (methyl alcohol, CH3OH or simply MeOH) may be used as:  \n\u2022 a hydrogen carrier; \n\u2022 a fuel; or \n\u2022 a feedstock for chemical synthesis. \n \nMethanol is the simplest liquid organic hydrogen carrier. It can be viewed either as a \nhydrogen storage compound or directly as a fuel. In methanol each m3 of carbon \ncombines with 1,100 m3 of hydrogen. In contrast, a maximum amount of 800 m3 of \nliquefied hydrogen can be theoretically stored in a 1 m3 tank at \u2013253\u00b0C [5]. Methanol is \nspecially favoured for future application in fuel cell-powered vehicles as an onboard \nhydrogen storage medium. This is mainly due to the fact that it can be broken down \nrelatively easy, with the use of steam, into carbon dioxide and hydrogen, from which \nthe fuel cell extracts the H2 fuel [6].   \n \nBiofuels (i.e. alcohols and biodiesels) and other renewable fuels offer clear advantages \nin terms of security of supply, reducing the dependency on imported petroleum \nproducts and technical and environmental performance. Biofuels can be manufactured \nvia numerous production options. Because of its physical and chemical characteristics, \n 3\nmethanol proved to be an attractive automotive fuel [7,8]. Methanol can be mixed with \nconventional petrol without any technical modifications having to be made to the \nvehicle fleet. Most methanol-fuelled vehicles use M85, a mixture of 85% of methanol \nand 15% of unleaded gasoline. Biodiesel is obtained by transesterification of vegetable \noils (triglycerides) with methanol. Biodiesel could be used without any major technical \nproblems to replace mineral diesel.  \n \nMeOH can be used in direct methanol fuel cells, where there is no need for an onboard \nreformer [6]. For the power industry, fuel grade methanol is a clean and efficient \nalternative fuel for gas turbines [9]. \n \nApproximately 70% of the methanol produced worldwide is used in chemical synthesis \n[10]. Globally, formaldehyde production consumes 35% of the methanol produced \nworldwide. 25% and 9% are employed for the production of methyl tertiary-butyl ether \n(MTBE) and acetic acid, respectively [11]. \n \n \n \n \n3. MANUFACTURING AND PROCESSING OF METHANOL \n \n \n \nMethanol can be synthesized from hydrogen and several carbon-containing feedstocks \nincluding: \n \n\u2022 carbon concentrated sources, such as natural gas, coal or biomass; and \n\u2022 carbon dioxide from flue gases of fossil-fuelled power plants or cement factories \nand the atmosphere. \n \n \n \n3.1. Methanol from Natural Gas \n \n \nCurrently, more than 75% of methanol is produced from natural gas [12]. The \nproduction is based on three fundamental steps: natural gas reforming in order to \nproduce synthesis gas (syngas), conversion of syngas into crude methanol, and \ndistillation of the crude methanol to achieve the desired purity [12-15]. Table 1 shows \nmain methanol-production technology suppliers and the operating conditions of the \nmethanol synthesis. \n \n \n \n3.2. Methanol from Coal \n \n \nThe production of methanol from coal involves similar basic processing steps to those \ninvolved in its production from natural gas: production of synthesis gas by the \ngasification of the coal, synthesis of crude methanol and purification of the crude \nmethanol [16-18]. The same methanol reactors as those employed for the natural gas-\nbased process can be used. The syngas produced from coal has, however, lower \nhydrogen content. The liquid phase methanol (LPMeOH) process is well suited for this \napplication [18]. An important feature of the LPMeOH technology is its potential \nintegration with a combined cycle power plant, i.e. integrated gasification combined \n 4\ncycle (IGCC) power generation [18]. With this integration, methanol could be produced \nfrom the excess syngas not committed for power generation. \n \n \n \n3.3. Methanol from Biomass \n \n \nMethanol can be produced from nearly all organic materials [19]. Biomass consists of \ncarbon which is already available in an enriched form so that this resource is \nadvantageous for the production of synfuels containing carbon [14]. When sustainable \nbiomass production is guaranteed, a CO2-neutral system is formed. \n \nThe process for producing methanol from biomass has the same steps as natural gas \nand coal-based processes: syngas production, methanol synthesis and purification \n[14,19-22]. However, conventional gasification processes applied to biomass do not \nalways produce a syngas with the quality required for methanol synthesis. In contrast \nto the biomass gasification process for electricity generation, the synthesis gas for the \nmethanol production should only contain a small proportion of inert gas components. \nThe use of air as a gasification agent, results in a syngas with a high nitrogen content. \nFor methanol synthesis the optimal H2:CO2 molal ratio in the syngas is >2 [19]. The \ngasification of biomass always results in a gas with a too low H2:CO2 ratio. Specht et al. \n[22] studied the two principle methods for adjusting the H2:CO2 ratio in the derived \nsyngas for methanol production: \n \n\u2022 Carbon dioxide separation. Excess carbon in form of CO2 is removed by an acid \ngas separation process. \n\u2022 Addition of hydrogen. An adequate amount of H2 is added for CO2 hydrogenation. \n \n \n \n3.4. Methanol from CO2 \n \n \nMethanol can be produced by heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide \n[22,23]: \n \nCO2 + 3 H2  \u2192  CH3OH + H2O \n \nIn contrast to the previous processes, the production of methanol from CO2 is only \npossible via the input of renewably-produced hydrogen. The process is presented in \nFigure 1. Available sources of CO2 that have been considered include flue gases of \nfossil fuel-fired power stations, cement factories, fermentation processes and water \npurification plants, as well as the atmosphere [6,22,24,25]. \n \n \n \n \n4. COMPARISON OF THE PROCESSES \n \n \n \nAn evaluation of the processes described in Section 3 was carried out. The criteria \nadopted for this preliminary screening process are: \n \n 5\n\u2022 the amount of carbon dioxide emitted during methanol production and use; \n\u2022 energy conversion efficiency; and  \n\u2022 estimated costs per tonne of methanol produced. \n \n \n \n4.1. CO2 Emissions \n \n \nLifecycle CO2 emissions (i.e. CO2 emitted over the entire cycle of methanol production \nand utilisation) were evaluated by Specht and Bandi [19]. These include emissions due \nto the transport of the feedstock to the synthesis plant, the production process, the \ntransport of the methanol to consumers and the emissions produced when it is used in \na passenger car.  \n \nThe coal-based process has the highest emissions, 3.8 kg CO2\/kg MeOH. Synthesis \nfrom natural gas leads to CO2 emissions of 1.6 kg CO2\/kg MeOH. In the biomass case, \nsince energy inputs (typically fossil fuel energy) are needed for growing, harvesting and \ntransport of the biomass, and for the delivery of the methanol to consumers, total \nlifecycle emissions, though very small compared with fossil fuel systems, are not zero \n(typically, 0.2 kg CO2\/kg MeOH). For the production of methanol from CO2 in the flue \ngases, lifecycle CO2 emissions are 0.8 kg CO2\/kg MeOH. 50% of these emissions are \ndue to the CO2 separation process. If atmospheric CO2 is the carbon source for the \nmethanol production, any CO2 emissions as a result of its separation, liquefaction and \ntransport are offset by the CO2 removed from the atmosphere. Consequently, this \noption is almost CO2-neutral, producing only 0.1 kg CO2\/kg MeOH. \n \n \n \n4.2. Energy Conversion Efficiencies \n \n \nValues of the energy conversion efficiencies for different methanol production \nprocesses have been obtained from the studies of Roan et al. [12], Williams et al. [16], \nSpecht and Bandi [19], Specht et al. [22] and Larson and Tingjing [26]. Due to the \ndifferent definitions of the conversion efficiency employed, degrees of maturity of the \nindividual processes and the capacities of the plants considered, these values should \nbe considered only as first approximations for guidance purposes. The widely-used \ncommercial process of methanol production from natural gas is the most efficient \nmethanol production process, exhibiting a typical value of 75%. This is followed by the \ncoal (48.5 \u2013 61.3%) and the biomass process (51%). Both CO2-process options have \nhigher energy demands, mainly due to the separation stage. The energy efficiency for \nthe concentrated CO2 process is about 46% while that utilising atmospheric CO2 \nexhibits an efficiency of only 38%. With more advanced technologies, the efficiency can \nbe improved to more than 50 and 44% respectively [22]. \n \n \n4.3. Production Costs \n \n \nEstimates of the costs of methanol produced from natural gas, coal, biomass and CO2, \naccording to the studies of Roan et al. [12], Williams et al. [16], DoE [18], Specht and \nBandi [19] and Specht et al. [22,27], are presented in Figure 2 in 2005 Euros. The \nselection of system components, the energy demand and the feedstocks are crucial \n 6\n[18,19]. Many other factors, such as capacity, mode of operation, operating conditions \nand the desired grade of purity of the final product affect the process economics. \nTherefore, the values presented in Fig. 2 are only guide figures for preliminary \nscreening. \n \nMethanol from biomass or flue-gas CO2 is at least 2 \u2013 3 times more expensive than \nfossil-fuel based methanol. Methanol can only compete with conventional fossil fuels \nunder an environmental taxation system based on pollutant emissions, particularly \nthose of CO2 [16,19,21,22,27,28]. Such a tax will favour mostly the production of \nmethanol from biomass or CO2 in flue gases. Comparing the untaxed renewable \nmethanol costs with taxed gasoline, the cost difference may be rather small [19]. \n \nAmong the new processes proposed for the employment of renewable hydrogen for the \nproduction methanol, the biomass process is the most cost effective. However, the \nutilisation of flue-gas CO2 for methanol production presents a competitive alternative. \nTherefore, the processes of methanol production from biomass and from CO2 in flue \ngases are selected for a more detailed analysis. \n \n \n \n \n5. METHANOL PRODUCTION FROM BIOMASS \n \n \n \n5.1. Process Technology \n \n \nA biomass-to-methanol plant consists of two main components, a biomass gasifier to \nconvert the feedstock to synthesis gas and a methanol synthesis plant. Biomass \ngasification technology is at the demonstration to early commercial stage. However, the \nintegration of biomass gasification with methanol production process is only at the R&D \nstage and scale-up and environmental issues may prove difficult to overcome [29]. \n \nThe process proposed by Ouellette et al. [21] is taken as an example for this \ntechnology. Apart from the type of biomass used, the gasifier and the methanol reactor, \nno more details about the process were specified by the authors. Various studies have, \ntherefore, been reviewed to complete the process description. \n \nSeveral routes involving conventional, commercial, or advanced technologies, which \nare under development, are possible. The proposed methanol production facility, based \non the process suggested by Ouellette et al. [21], consists of the following basic steps \n(see Figure 3):   \n\u2022 Feedstock pre-treatment. Biomass resources most appropriate for this application \ninclude wood and wood wastes [20-22,29,30]. Feed preparation is dependent on \nbiomass characteristics and gasifier requirement and commonly includes chipping \nand drying [30].  \n\u2022 Biomass gasification. The selection and design of any biomass gasification \nsystem are determined mainly by the characteristics of the feedstock, existing \nenvironmental legislation, the costs and performance of the equipment available, as \nwell as the capacity needed [31]. The oxygen needed for the biomass gasification \ncomes from water electrolysis using electricity produced from a renewable energy \nsource. Ouellette et al. [21] indicated that an amount of10.32 ktonne of oxygen was \nused to gasify 10.1 ktonne of dry biomass annually. Under these conditions, all CO \n 7\nand CO2 in the syngas reacted with both electrolytic and syngas hydrogen, but \noxygen was in excess. Making use of the readily available supply of electrolytic \noxygen can improve the overall productivity of biomass-derived methanol [21,25].  \n\u2022 Syngas treatment. The product gas from the gasifier contains tars, particles, dust, \nalkali, sulphuric and chloride compounds which can block or poison the catalysts \ndownstream and cause corrosion of the equipment [30,32]. Generally, the smaller \nthe molecules from which a gas is produced, the lower is the capital investment \nrequired in the treatment facilities [14]. According to Hamelinck and Faaij [30], \nadvanced high temperature dry cleaning (see Figure 4) achieves contaminant \nconcentrations of between 10 to 20 ppbv, sufficient to avoid catalyst contamination \nand damage to the equipment.  \n\u2022 Hydrocarbon reforming. In the presence of suitable catalysts (usually nickel \nbased), methane, tars and other hydrocarbons are reformed into CO and H2 at high \ntemperatures [30]. Both steam reforming at 830 \u2013 1000\u00b0C and 1.0 \u2013 3.5 MPa or \nautothermal reforming (ATR) at 900 \u2013 1000\u00b0C is possible.  \n\u2022 Hydrogen addition. The addition of hydrogen adjust the proper H2:CO ratio for \nmethanol synthesis. This ratio should be slightly higher than 2 [12,19]. Ouellette et \nal. [21] reported an electrolytic hydrogen consumption of 1.29 ktonne for the \nproduction of 12.2 ktonne of methanol per year.  \n\u2022 Methanol synthesis. Ouellette et al. [21] chose the Lurgi methanol reactor for the \nconversion of the reformed syngas. The Lurgi methanol process produces \nmethanol by catalytic conversion of synthesis gas at low pressure in the gaseous \nphase [14]. The main advantages of this technology are low investments and \nproduction costs, improved operational reliability, and great flexibility in the choice \nof the plant size [14].  \n\u2022 Distillation. After cooling and separation of the purge gas, the crude methanol is \nprocessed in a distillation unit to achieve the required quality. \n \nOptional are the inclusion of a gas turbine or a boiler coupled with a steam turbine to \nutilise the unconverted gas for a possible electricity co-production [30].  \n \n \n \n5.2. Performance and Economics \n \n \nIn order to assess the energy conversion efficiency of the processes considered on the \nsame basis, all energy inputs were converted into thermal energy, assuming a thermal \nenergy-to-electricity average conversion efficiency of 38.2% [33]. The energy contents \nof the biomass input and the methanol produced were evaluated based on their \nrespective Lower calorific values. A reference plant with 8000 working hours per year \n[25] was considered in order to compare the results of different studies. It should also \nbe noted that these studies were carried out in different countries at different times. \nThis might have affected the prices of raw materials as well as operation and \nmaintenance costs. In this analysis all the prices were converted to 2005 Euros. \n \nThe evaluation of biomass-to-methanol process is based on the investigations of \nOuellette et al. [21] and Specht et al. [22]. Both studies proposed two possibilities; \neither vent some of the CO2 produced in the gasification step, or add extra hydrogen in \norder to achieve the syngas composition required for the methanol synthesis. In this \nanalysis the later option was selected to avoid CO2 emissions. Table 2 and 3 show the \nmain results obtained from these studies. \n \n 8\nThe figures for the electricity consumption differ so much because Specht et al. [22] \nconsidered the electricity used for the production of hydrogen by water  electrolysis (i.e. \n4.2 kWh\/Nm3 of hydrogen produced) [27]. This resulted in a lower energy conversion \nefficiency of the process compared with the corresponding figure in the study of \nOuellette et al. [21], where only the electricity required by the methanol production \nprocess was considered. This also explains the much higher capital investment for the \nplant proposed by Specht et al. [22] and the corresponding higher unit cost of the \nmethanol produced. \n \nEnergy conversion efficiency of methanol production from biomass depends on three \nmain factors: \n \n\u2022 Additional process steps (e.g. gas cleaning and conditioning and gas compression) \nconsume energy and decrease the overall conversion efficiency. \n\u2022 Co-generation of electricity and heat can improve the efficiency. \n\u2022 Energy efficiency increases with plant capacity. \n \nAlthough significant progress has been achieved in biomass gasification and new \nimproved technologies are being demonstrated, the process, with only a few rare \nexceptions, remains in the development stage. The main reason is that gasification of \nbiomass to produce fuels shows lower energy conversion efficiencies and higher costs \ncompared with the production of heat or electricity by direct biomass combustion \n[34,35]. \n \n \n \n \n6. METHANOL FROM FLUE-GASE CARBON DIOXIDE \n \n \n \n6.1. Process Technology \n \n \nUsing flue-gas CO2 as a feedstock to produce methanol presents the advantages of \nbeing an emission abatement technology for this greenhouse gas and recycling CO2 \nemitted from stationary sources as a hydrogen carrier. In this system methanol is \nproduced by hydrogenation of CO2. This novel, but proven, technology has been \nstudied by many authors [3,25,27,33].  \n \nThe three principle steps of the methanol production process are:  \n \n\u2022 CO2 separation\/recovery. Amine absorption is the dominant technology for carbon \ndioxide extraction from flue gases. Several studies have shown it to be the most \neconomic option for conventional pulverised coal power stations [25,27,36-38].  \n\u2022 CO2\/MeOH transportation and storage. Once CO2 is recovered from the emitting \nsource, it must be liquefied and transported to the hydrogen production site. \nCommonly, renewable electricity is available for water electrolysis in relatively \nremote areas, far from the methanol demand site. So also methanol might need to \nbe transported after its production [2,10,27,33].  \n\u2022 Methanol synthesis. The production of methanol from recycled CO2 and H2 \nconsists of two steps: methanol synthesis (or CO2 hydrogenation) over a catalyst \nand methanol purification [25,33,38,39]. However, prior to entering the synthesis \nreactor, the gases may need some conditioning.  \n \n 9\n6.2. Performance and Economics \n \n \nThe evaluation of CO2-to-methanol process has been based on the investigations of \nMignard et al. [25], Specht et al. [27] and Sakamoto and Zhou [33]. Energy losses, high \ncapital costs and the energy needed to liquefy hydrogen makes the option of \ntransporting electrolytic hydrogen to the methanol generation plant economically \nunviable. Therefore, two possible practical scenarios can be adopted in the production \nof methanol from carbon dioxide: \n \n\u2022 Scenario A: Transport the CO2 to the hydrogen production site. The costs and \nenergy consumption of transporting both carbon dioxide, captured from the flue \ngases of coal-fired power stations, and methanol to and from the hydrogen \nproduction plant, respectively, were assessed by Specht et al. [27] and Sakamoto \nand Zhou [33]. The methanol plant proposed by Sakamoto and Zhou [33] consists \nof two major facilities, the MeOH synthesis unit and a fuel cell unit, and produces \n323 tonne\/hour (2.58 Mtonne\/year) of MeOH. Specht et al. [27] based their studies \non methanol synthesis using a bench-scale plant with an assumed capacity of 200 \ntonnes per day. Results from both studies are given in Table 4. The higher energy \nconversion efficiency of the system proposed by Sakamoto and Zhou [33] is due \nthe higher capacity of the methanol plant, which is more than 38 times the capacity \nof the plant suggested by Specht et al. [27], and the lower overall energy \nconsumption, principally due to the lower energy consumption in the CO2 recovery \nprocess. Furthermore, Specht et al. [27] did not take into account the energy \nneeded in the form of heat in the methanol process, so the actual efficiency of his \nprocess is slightly overestimated. This scenario entails the difficulty of providing the \nheat necessary for methanol distillation units, i.e. 9.83 kWh\/kmol of feed gas [38]. \nThis amount of heat cannot be satisfied by the heat available from the methanol \nsynthesis reaction, i.e. 2.01 kWh\/kmol of feed gas [38]. To supply the remaining \nheat required, a small-scale, efficient biomass combustion unit can be employed.  \n \n\u2022 Scenario B: The CO2 recovery site is very close to the electrolysis plant. The \nresults of Mignard et al. [25] for this study are summarised in Table 5. In addition to \nthe advantage of cost savings in processing, shipping and delivering the captured \nCO2, there is also the possibility of making use of the waste heat from the power \nstation [25]. This avoids the production of steam to supply the methanol plant, and \nthus eliminates any additional CO2 emissions. However, the limitation of this \nscenario is that renewable energy utilisation schemes are commonly located in \nremote locations, where they are more viable, far away from the power stations \nfrom which the CO2 is recovered. \n \nTable 6 presents a comparison of available data concerning the economics of the \nprocesses investigated for scenarios A and B. The unit production cost of methanol \ndepends strongly on the unit price of renewable electricity (assumed to be \nhydroelectricity) used for hydrogen production by the electrolysis of water. The huge \ndifference in capital cost, reported by Mignard et al. [25], compared with those for  \nbiomass processes is due to the inclusion of  the extra units for the flue gas cleaning, \nwater purification plant for the electrolyser and a fuel cell plant to supply electricity \nwhen renewable energy is not available. \n \nFor the production of methanol, the amount of CO2 recovered from the flue gases must \nbe matched with electrolytic hydrogen with a 1:3 molal ratio. The hydrogen production \nwill be usually limited to electricity off-peak periods. Therefore, the capacity of the \nmethanol plant will depend on the amount of renewable electricity committed for this \npurpose. Specht et al. [27] suggested that the efficiency of the entire process can be \nimproved if more efficient CO2 recovery systems are employed. Commercially-available \n 10\ncatalysts employed in CO2 hydrogenation loose activity and selectivity. New catalysts \nfor this process are currently under investigation.  \n \n \n \n \n7. CONCLUSIONS \n \n \n \nExcess generation capacity of renewable energy utilisation schemes at off-peak \nperiods can be used for hydrogen production by electrolysis. Currently hydrogen has a \nlimited use as a fuel. Utilising this hydrogen for the production of methanol results in a \nmore friendly fuel, ready to use within the current infrastructure.  \n \nBecause of their independence of fossil fuels and environmental advantages, two \npossible pathways of producing renewable methanol using electrolytic hydrogen have \nbeen investigated (see Figure 5): methanol production by the synthesis of the syngas \nresulting from biomass gasification, and by hydrogenation of carbon dioxide captured \nfrom the flue gases of mainly coal-fired power stations. \n \nMethanol production from biomass has been proved cheaper and more efficient than \nfrom CO2 (see Table 7). It can, therefore, be considered as a realistic, short-term option \nof producing methanol from renewable hydrogen. On the other hand, methanol \nproduction from carbon dioxide must be also seen as a way of the abatement of the \nemissions of this greenhouse gas and reduce its emissions. Although many options are \nbeing investigated for the utilisation of CO2 captured from flue gases of power stations, \nmethanol production has been demonstrated to be a feasible alternative option. Further \nadvances in CO2 recovery technology, make this option a viable long-term proposition \nfor renewable methanol production. \n \n \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \n \n[1] IEA (International Energy Agency).
