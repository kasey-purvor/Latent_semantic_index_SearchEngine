Their\nadoption has been driven not only by the market participants themselves in\nreaction to their experiences of market turbulence, but also by a regulatory\nclimate that encourages putting so-called market sensitive risk management\nsystems at the operational center of financial institutions. In particular,\nthe 1996 amendment of the Basel Accord on regulatory capital for market\nrisk (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 1996) has been especially\ninfluential in this development.\nThe imposition of market sensitive regulatory capital stems from the pru-\ndential objective of limiting the risk of failure of an individual institution by\nproviding an appropriate buffer against external shocks. In most instances,\nthe existence of such a buffer would be consistent with the self-interested\ndecisions of the financial institution itself. However, the need for the impo-\nsition of regulatory capital arises when the incentives of the individual market\nparticipant point toward socially sub-optimal risk-taking due to agency prob-\nlems within the organization. The case for regulatory capital is reinforced\nby the consumer protection mandate of the regulator where the need is to\nprotect vulnerable uninformed stakeholders of the institution such as small\ndepositors of a bank.\nHowever, there has been growing concern that the widespread adoption\nof market sensitive risk management practices may have the unintended and\nundesirable side-effect of exacerbating short term price fluctuations in finncial\nmarkets. A typical statement of this concern is summarized in the following\npassage1.\n\u201cSo-called value-at-risk models (VAR) blend science and art. They\nestimate how much a portfolio could lose in a single bad day. If\nthat amount gets too large, the VAR model signals that the bank\nshould sell. The trouble is that lots of banks have similar in-\nvestments and similar VAR models. In periods when markets ev-\nerywhere decline, the models can tell everybody to sell the same\nthings at the same time, making market conditions much worse.\nIn effect, they can, and often do, create a vicious feedback loop.\u201d\nAll risk-management systems in widespread use today rest on techniques\nthat attempt to infer the statistical relations governing asset returns by ref-\nerence to actual, historical realizations of returns. Indeed, this is dictated\n1The Economist Magazine, Oct 12th 2000.\n2\nby the 1996 Basel amendment. By their nature, such risk-management sys-\ntems treat the uncertainty governing asset returns as being exogenous. They\nneglect the fact that the behavior of market participants is affected by the\nadoption of these techniques, creating a feedback effect on the whole financial\nsystem. In short, these systems abstract from the system-wide consequences\nof widespread adoption of these techniques. Blum (1999), Basak and Shapiro\n(2001), Dan\u00b4\u0131elsson (2002), Dan\u00b4\u0131elsson and Zigrand (2001), Morris and Shin\n(1999), Crockett (2000), and Persaud (2000) are some recent comments that\nexpress unease about the current practice.\nTo their credit, many regulators have recognized the potentially desta-\nbilizing effects of market sensitive risk regulation. In the days following\nthe terrorist attack on New York and Washington on September 11th 2001,\nfinancial markets around the world were buffeted by unprecedented turbu-\nlence. In response to the short term disruption to the smooth functioning of\nmarkets, the authorities responded by suspending various solvency tests ap-\nplied to large financial institutions such as life insurance firms. In the U.K.,\nfor instance, the usual \u2018resilience test\u2019 applied to life insurance companies\nin which the firm has to demonstrate solvency in the face of a further 25%\nmarket decline was suspended for several weeks. More recently, following\nthe renewed declined in stocks markets in the summer of 2002, the Financial\nServices Authority - the U.K. regulator - has diluted the resilience test so\nas to pre-empt the destabilizing forced sales of stocks by the major market\nplayers2.\nNevertheless, the fact remains that the overall framework for risk regu-\nlation relies on a prudential perspective that views each financial institution\non its own. The framework tends to neglect the system-wide perspective.\nHence, the blindspot in conventional risk management techniques, and espe-\ncially the supervisory approach to the regulation of risk, is the presumption\nthat risk management is a single-person decision problem i.e. a game against\nnature. That is, uncertainty governing price movements is assumed to be\nexogenous, and assumed not to depend on the actions of other decision mak-\ners. The analogy is with a meteorologist trying to predict the weather. The\nweather is unaffected by the predictions issued by weather forecasters and\nthe consequent actions that these forecasts generate. Financial markets are\ndifferent. When short run price changes are influenced by the trading deci-\nsions of market participants (as surely they must), then shifts in the beliefs\nof market participants will lead to actions that precipitate certain outcomes.\nThere is, in other words, a feedback effect from the beliefs of market partici-\n2Financial Times, Weekend Money, June 28th 2002, \u201cInsolvency rules are eased for\nlife offices\u201d by Jason Corcoran.\n3\npants to the actual outcome in the market. Indeed, there are strong reasons\nto believe that this feedback effect will reinforce any exogenous pressures on\nprices arising from the fundamentals.\nA gambling analogy is instructive. If the underlying uncertainty facing a\ntrader were exogenous, modelling risk is akin to a gambler facing a spin of\na roulette wheel, where the bets placed by him and other gamblers do not\naffect the outcome of the spin. However, when the outcome depends on the\nactions of other traders, risk modelling resembles poker more than roulette.\nCurrent risk management practices rest on the roulette view of uncertainty.\nThe roulette wheel may have an unknown number of outcomes with differing\nprobabilities, but as long as the outcome is unaffected by the actions of other\ngamblers, it is simply a matter of applying standard statistical techniques to\npast outcomes to enumerate what these outcomes are, and to estimate their\nrespective probabilities. Much of the sophisticated techniques in the current\nstate of the art can be seen as alternative ways of refining such estimation\nprocedures, as well as tracking the non\u2013linear payoff structures arising from\nderivative securities. To the extent that the stochastic process governing\nasset prices depends on what traders do, this view of the world is invalid.\nThe uncertainty facing traders is endogenous, and depends on the actions of\nmarket participants.\nIn what follows, we investigate the consequences of the widespread adop-\ntion of market-sensitive risk management systems that treat financial market\nuncertainty as exogenous, and do not take into account the feedback from\ntraders\u2019 actions to the market outcomes. We gauge their systemic impact\nby comparing the dynamics of asset prices with risk\u2013management systems\nand compare this with asset price dynamics in the absence of such systems.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we will give a non-\ntechnical overview of our model and summarize some of our main simulation\nresults. Section 3 presents the model in more detail, and Section 4 describes\nour simulations in more detail.\nThe original objective of introducing market sensitive regulatory rules of\ncourse remains valid even if our arguments are taken on board. Our ar-\nguments do not address the agency problems in financial institutions and\nthe associated incentive issues. Nor have we addressed the consumer pro-\ntection mandate of the regulator. The costs of risk regulation must be set\nagainst the benefits. Our purpose in this paper is to contribute to a fully\ninformed debate on the issue by highlighting the endogenous nature of risk\nwhen market participants are faced with regulatory constraints.\n4\n2 Overview of Model and Simulation Results\nOur model is based on a standard asset pricing model where a large num-\nber of small traders each have constant absolute risk aversion, but where\nthe degree of risk aversion varies across traders. The underlying uncertainty\nis driven by the cashflow process which is assumed to be conditionally nor-\nmal. The model builds on the single period model by Dan\u00b4\u0131elsson and Zigrand\n(2001) in which a Value\u2013at\u2013Risk (VaR) constraint is introduced that restricts\nthe portfolio choices of traders. Specifically, traders forecast next period\u2019s\nrisk, and this estimate restricts their portfolio selection. A similar model\nhas been proposed by Basak and Shapiro (2001). Crucially, traders follow\ncurrent practices in risk management and forecast risk by means of a stan-\ndard variance\u2013covariance (VCV) technique. In other words, traders use a\nbackward\u2013looking belief revision process in which forecasts are generated by\nreference to past realizations of returns, as recommended by many of the\ncurrent risk management systems and required by regulators.\nWhen the VaR constraint binds, we show that it has an effect similar to\nan increase in the underlying risk aversion of the traders. Since the degree\nto which this constraint binds is determined by market outcomes, the net\neffect of the VaR constraint is that the traders behave as if their degree of\nrisk aversion is fluctuating with the market outcomes. In particular, since\nthe VaR constraint binds mostly during periods of market turbulence, the\nincreased effective risk aversion leads to sales of risky assets, and serves to\nexacerbate market volatility and to reduce liquidity. This is indeed one way in\nwhich we can understand the frequently heard statement from market pundits\nduring distressed episodes that the \u201clevel of risk aversion has gone up.\u201d Such\nstatements are normally frowned upon by conventional economists, since risk\naversion is part of the make\u2013up of the individual trader (much like the color of\nhis eyes), and are part of the basic parameters of the economy. However, our\ninterpretation suggests that even if the underlying basic preferences remain\nconstant over time, the actions of the traders are determined by a rule which\nis identical to the actions of someone whose risk aversion is fluctuating over\ntime.\nThe dynamics of the model are generated by the sequence of events in\nwhich the risk-constrained traders have a set of beliefs based upon which they\nform their net asset demands. Market-clearing then generates equilibrium\nprices. The assets yield exogenous random payoffs which in turn determine\nrealized returns for risky assets. Completing the cycle, the traders use this\nrealization to update their beliefs and the economy advances by one period.\nThe following diagram illustrates the sequence of events that generate the\ndynamics in our model.\n5\nWe can implement our model once we specify the exogenous stochastic\nprocess that generates the payoffs of the assets at the beginning of each\ndate. We use standard linear normal models to generate this exogenous\nuncertainty, incorporating volatility clustering (GARCH) effects, calibrated\nto stylized facts about financial data. Our simulations reveal the following\neffects of the widespread adoption of VaR constraints.\n\u2022 Prices (for positive\u2013beta assets) are lower with VaR constraints than\nwithout. The magnitudes can sometimes be very substantial.\n\u2022 Following a negative shock to asset prices, the troughs in the price\npaths are deeper, last longer, and take a longer time to recover when\nthere are VaR constraints.\n\u2022 The forecast variance of returns is, in general, larger with VaR con-\nstraints than without. The difference in the forecast variance as be-\ntween the constrained and unconstrained economy is largest during\ndistressed episodes in the market.\nFrom our simulations, it seems that the widespread adoption of backward\u2013\nlooking risk management practices, such as standard VCV methods, may\nhave a detrimental effect on asset price volatility and market distress. Far\nfrom having a dampening effect on price volatility, it may have the perverse\neffect of exacerbating it.\n3 Model\nWe now give a more complete description of our model, and describe how\na VaR constraint affects traders\u2019 actions. Time is discrete, and indexed by\nt \u2208 {0, 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 }. In each period, there are three traded assets, labeled as\nassets 0, 1 and 2. Asset 0 is the risk-free asset, while assets 1 and 2 are\nrisky. Without loss of generality we assume there is a fixed, deterministic\ntime-invariant supply of \u03b8i units of the i\nth risky asset. We denote by qit the\nprice of the ith asset at time t. Any asset traded at time t \u2212 1 matures at\ndate t, and yields payoff dit. The gross return on asset i between periods t\nand t + 1 is denoted by Ri,t+1, and defined as\nRi,t+1 \u2261 di,t+1\nqit\nDenote by Rt the vector of returns over risky assets, so that\nRt \u2261\n(\nR1t\nR2t\n)\n6\nThe traders in our model have short horizons, in the sense that they\nchoose their portfolio to maximize expected utility in the next period. The\nshort horizon assumption tries to capture the incentives that fund managers\nface in which considerable emphasis is placed on short\u2013term assessments\nof their performance, or internal controls on their discretion such as \u2018daily\nearnings at risk\u2019 (DEAR) limits.\nTo further facilitate the analysis, we reduce the dynamic portfolio choice\nproblem to a sequence of one\u2013period choice problems by assuming that the\nassets in the economy mature after one period, and traders must roll over\ntheir holding in each period. If we denote by xht the number of units of the\nsafe asset held by trader h between periods t and t+1 and by yhit the number\nof units of the risky asset i held by trader h between periods t and t+1, then\nthe wealth in period t + 1 for trader h is given by\nW ht+1 \u2261 xht d0,t+1 +\n\u2211\ni\nyhitdi,t+1\nAt date t, trader h aims to maximize the expected value of his von Neumann\nMorgenstern utility\nu\n(\nW ht+1\n)\nThe traders are also assumed to have constant absolute risk aversion, so that\nthe asset demands are independent of wealth, and prices depend only on the\naggregate endowments, rather than the distribution of endowments across\ntraders. In particular, we suppose that there is a continuum of small traders\nand denote by \u03b1h the coefficient of absolute risk aversion of trader h. The\npopulation of traders is such that \u03b1h is distributed uniformly on the interval\n[\u0003, 1] where \u0003 > 0. This last assumption ensures that there are no risk-neutral\ntraders in our model.\nSince prices are independent of the distribution of wealth across traders in\nsuch a model, we can simplify the notation without affecting the equilibrium\nprices by assuming that the new supply of the risky assets at each period\nis owned by individuals other than the traders themselves. Moreover, we\nsuppose that the aggregate endowments of the risky assets are constant over\ntime. Denote by\n\u03b8 \u2261\n(\n\u03b81\n\u03b82\n)\nthe vector of time-invariant aggregate supplies of the risky assets.\nThis model is a multiperiod extension of the Dan\u00b4\u0131elsson and Zigrand\n(2001) model. Their model analyzes the general equilibrium implications\nof VaR constraints with emphasis on a formal analysis of the single period\nproblem. Here, we extend the analysis to a multi\u2013period learning framework\nby means of simulations\n7\n3.1 Belief Revision Process\nA key feature of our approach is the modelling of the beliefs of the traders. In\norder to replicate the effect of risk\u2013management systems that rely on realized\nhistorical returns, we investigate the effects of a backward\u2013looking belief\nrevision mechanism for traders. We assume that the traders update their\nbeliefs through standard VCV tools for forecasting covariance matrices, in\nparticular, RiskMetricsTM. Furthermore we assume the traders use a similar\nforecasting rule for returns. Although it would be straightforward to model\nupdating of beliefs with more sophisticated techniques, such as having the\ntraders optimize a GARCH-type model each period, we believe that this\nwould not add to our results in any significant way.\nThe traders\u2019 beliefs on returns are conditionally jointly normal, and we\ndenote by (\u00b5t,\u03a3t) the traders\u2019 beliefs concerning the expected returns \u00b5t\nand covariances of returns \u03a3t of the risky assets between dates t and t + 1.\nThus,\n\u00b5t =\n(\n\u00b51t\n\u00b52t\n)\n\u03a3t =\n(\n\u03c311t \u03c3\n12\nt\n\u03c312t \u03c3\n22\nt\n)\nwhere \u03c3ijt is the covariance of Ri,t+1 and Rj,t+1.\nThe traders adjust their beliefs concerning the expected returns and co-\nvariances by taking a geometric weighted average of past realizations, where\nthe decay factor \u03c1 = 0.97 follows the RiskMetricsTM (1999) recommenda-\ntions. The backward\u2013looking belief revision mechanism can be formalized in\nterms of the recursive updating rule given by the mapping\n((\u00b5t,\u03a3t) ,Rt+1) \u0004\u2192\n(\n\u00b5t+1,\u03a3t+1\n)\nwhere\n\u03c3ijt+1 = \u03c1\u03c3\nij\nt + (1\u2212 \u03c1)(Rit \u2212 \u00b5it)(Rjt \u2212 \u00b5jt) (1)\nfor constant \u03c1 \u2208 (0, 1), and likewise for \u00b5t+1, so that\n\u00b5t+1 = \u03c1\u00b5t + (1\u2212 \u03c1)Rt (2)\nThe dynamics of our model are generated in the following fashion. The\neconomy begins with an initial set of beliefs for the traders, given by (\u00b50,\u03a30).\nBased on these beliefs, traders make their portfolio choices. If traders are\nconstrained by a VaR constraint, their portfolio choices will be affected (we\nwill examine the optimal portfolio rules in more detail below). Given the\n8\nportfolio choices, the aggregate demand functions can be defined. Together\nwith the aggregate endowments \u03b8, we can derive the prices of the assets.\nThen, the realizations of payoffs {d1} determine the returns R1 for the risky\nassets, and the traders update their beliefs according to (1) and (2). This is\nrepeated until the simulation ends at t = T .\nBeliefs (\u00b5t,\u03a3t)\nDemand yht\nPrices qt Payoffs realized dt+1\nReturns Rt+1\nA\nd\nva\nn\nce\non\ne\np\ner\nio\nd\nIn order to implement our model, we need to solve for the optimal port-\nfolio decisions of the traders, and specify the stochastic process generating\nthe payoffs. We tackle each in turn.\n3.2 The Value\u2013at\u2013Risk Constraint\nWe first solve the portfolio choice problem of the traders, in which they face\na possible constraint on the probability of a loss beyond some fixed size. We\nexamine the constraint of the form\nProbt\n[\nEt\n(\nW ht+1\n)\u2212W ht+1 \u2265 VaR] \u2264 p\u00af (3)\nwhere VaR is the permitted value-at-risk, and p\u00af is the permitted probability\nwith which the VaR limit can be breached. Given the conditional normality\nof beliefs, we can express this constraint in simple terms. Denoting by \u03a6 (\u00b7)\nthe distribution function of the standard normal, note that (3) holds if and\nonly if\n\u03a6\n(\u2212VaR\n\u03c3W,t+1\n)\n\u2264 p\u00af\nwhere \u03c3W,t+1 is the standard deviation of W\nh\nt+1 with respect to the beliefs at\ndate t. Equivalently, this condition can be written as\n\u03c32W,t+1 \u2264\n(\nVaR\n\u03a6\u22121 (1\u2212 p\u00af)\n)2\n\u2261 v\u00af (4)\n9\nThus, the VaR constraint boils down to a constraint on the maximal permit-\nted variance of W ht+1. The right hand side of (4) is a constant determined by\nthe parameters of the problem, and we will denote it by v\u00af.\nIt is useful to consider the forecast distribution of payoffs in addition to\nthose for returns. The forecast distribution follows from the updating process\n(1). Denote by\n(mt,St)\nthe forecast mean and covariance of payoffs, and denote by\nsijt\nthe (i, j)th entry of St. Thus, s\nij\nt is the traders\u2019 belief of the covariance\nbetween di,t+1 and dj,t+1.\nWe can then incorporate the VaR constraint formally into a trader\u2019s port-\nfolio choice problem. Denoting by Et (\u00b7) the expectations operator with re-\nspect to beliefs at date t, trader h\u2019s optimization problem at date t is to\nmaximize\nEt\n(\nuh\n(\nW ht+1\n))\nby choosing portfolio holdings xht , y\nh\n1t, y\nh\n2t, subject to\nq0txt +\n\u2211\ni\nqity\nh\nit \u2264 d0txt\u22121 +\n\u2211\ni\ndity\nh\ni,t\u22121\n\u2211\ni\n\u2211\nj\nsijt y\nh\nity\nh\njt \u2264 v\u00af\nThe first constraint is the period t budget constraint of trader h. The right\nhand side of the constraint is the available wealth resulting from last period\u2019s\ninvestment, while the left hand side is the value of the portfolio purchased at\ntime t. The second constraint is the VaR constraint, which can be expressed\nmore succinctly as\nyh\n\u2032\nt Sty\nh\nt \u2264 v\u00af\nThe first\u2013order condition for the optimal portfolio can then be written as:\nEt\n[\nuh\n\u2032 (\nW ht+1\n)\n(dt+1 \u2212 d0,t+1qt)\n]\n= 2\u03bbht Sty\nh\nt\nwhere \u03bbht is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the VaR constraint for\ntrader h at date t. Denote by \u03c6ht the normalized Lagrange multiplier for the\nVaR constraint, given by.\n\u03c6ht \u2261\n2\u03bbht\nEt [uh\n\u2032 ]\n10\nThen, the first order condition can be re-arranged to yield the demand func-\ntions:\nyht =\n1\n\u03b1h + \u03c6ht\nS\u22121t (mt \u2212 d0,t+1qt)\nWere it not for the \u03c6ht term in the denominator, these demand functions are\nthe familiar textbook ones for traders with constant absolute risk aversion.\nThe VaR constraint enters into the problem by raising the effective risk aver-\nsion for the trader from \u03b1h to \u03b1h + \u03c6ht . In other words, the introduction of\nthe VaR constraint acts in the same way as a fluctuating risk aversion level\nof the trader.\nBy setting aggregate demand equal to the supplies \u03b8, we can solve for the\nequilibrium prices at date t.\nqt =\n1\nd0,t+1\n(mt \u2212\u03a8tSt\u03b8) (5)\nwhere\n\u03a8t \u2261 1\u222b 1\n\u0001\n1\n\u03b1h+\u03c6ht\ndh\n\u03a8t can be given an interpretation in terms of the average \u201ceffective risk\naversion\u201d across all traders at date t. It is proportional to the harmonic\nmean of the individual effective risk aversion coefficients \u03b1h + \u03c6ht .\nThe expression for equilibrium prices in (5) suggests that we can make\nsome sense of the frequently heard statement during distressed episodes for\nthe market that the \u201clevel of risk aversion has gone up.\u201d Our expression\nfor equilibrium prices suggest that even if the basic risk aversion is constant\n(given by \u03b1h), the trader acts \u201cas if\u201d his risk aversion was fluctuating over\ntime. It is in this sense that we can regard \u03a8t as the average effective risk\naversion of the traders.\nThe implementation of our model entails solving for the time series of\n{\u03a8t}. There are a number of subtleties in solving for \u03a8t, since the Lagrange\nmultipliers \u03bbht depend on the contemporaneous prices, and hence the solu-\ntion of \u03a8t involves solving a fixed point problem. The reader is referred to\nDan\u00b4\u0131elsson and Zigrand (2001) for the detailed solution method, and for the\nconditions for the existence of equilibrium. However, the solution for \u03a8t can\nbe given a relatively clean explicit characterization.\nIn order to state the solution for \u03a8t explicitly, first consider the function\nzez. This is a non-monotonic function that has a minimum at z = \u22121. For\nz < \u22121, it is a decreasing function for z, while when z > \u22121, it is an increas-\ning function of z. Consider the restriction of this function to the interval\n(\u2212\u221e,\u22121]. The inverse of this restricted function is defined for the interval\n11\n[\u2212e\u22121, 0), and takes values in (\u2212\u221e,\u22121]. This partial function is sometimes\nreferred to as the non-principal branch of the Lambert correspondence. We\ndenote this partial function as F (\u00b7). Then, the explicit solution for \u03a8t can\nbe stated as follows (see Dan\u00b4\u0131elsson and Zigrand, 2001)\n\u03a8t =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\n1\nln \u0003\u22121\nif 0 \u2264 \u03bat \u2264 \u0003 ln \u0003\u22121\n\u03bat \u2212 \u0003\n\u03batF\n(\u2212 (\u03bat + \u0003) e\u22121) if \u0003 ln \u0003\u22121 \u2264 \u03bat \u2264 1\u2212 \u0003\nwhere\n\u03bat \u2261\n\u221a\n\u03b8\u2032St\u03b8\nv\u00af\nAn equilibrium fails to exist when \u03bat > 1\u2212\u0003. The intuition for this lies in the\ninterpretation of \u03bat. The numerator is the total risk in the economy that must\nbe borne by the traders as a whole, while the denominator is the maximum\nallowable risk. The total measure of traders is 1\u2212 \u0003, and equilibrium fails to\nexist when the per capita risk in the economy is too large for the traders to\ntake on.\n4 Simulations\nWe now come to the core of our paper, where we report the simulation\nresults of our model. Having solved for the equilibrium prices, the latent\ndata generation process (DGP) for the payoffs remains to be specified. The\nbackward\u2013looking updating rule used by the traders in our model means that\nthe perceived DGP believed by the traders is different from the latent DGP.\nIn particular, the fact that the distribution of the return process is latent and\nhas to be forecast by a variance\u2013covariance (VCV) method mirrors practice\nin the actual market.\nFor our simulations, we chose a latent DGP for payoffs that conformed\nto some of the stylized facts of financial returns. In order to take account of\nfeatures such as volatility clustering, unconditional non\u2013normality, and the\nrelative size difference between returns and volatility, we specified a GARCH\nprocess, where the actual parameter values were chosen by calibration to fit\nsome reasonable summary statistics. Thus, in the results we report below,\nthe true payoffs are conditionally normal and unconditionally non\u2013normal,\nand allow for volatility clustering. To ensure that our simulations were not\naffected by the initial conditions, we allowed the economy to adjust for 500\nperiods in the simulations before we start to record the data. Thus, date 0\nin our reported results is date 501 of the actual simulation\n12\n4.1 Parameter Values\nThe following parameter values for our model were used in the simulations,\nwhere m\u02c6 is the mean of the latent payoff process, and S\u02c6 is the unconditional\ncovariance matrix of the latent payoff process.\nendowments \u03b8 =\n(\n1.9\n0.5\n)\ndaily risk free rate r0 = 1.00013\ndecay factor \u03c1 = 0.97\nlowest risk aversion \u0003 = 0.0011\nunconditional latent payoff distribution S\u02c6 =\n(\n0.6 0.25\n0.25 0.4\n)\nm\u02c6 =\n(\n1.5\n1.2\n)\nThe main results are presented in a series of figures. We first show the\nresult of the typical run, and then we examine the impact of an exogenous\nshock to the latent payoff process that is the equivalent of a large shock that\nmay be expected once in ten years. Finally, we will report how we can track\nchanges in the effective risk aversion, prices and volatility, perceived as well\nas actual. All figures are presented at the end of the paper.\n4.2 Analysis of a Run\nGiven the sample economy, we set the risk constraint v\u00af = 100. The price\nevolution of the price of asset 1 is shown in Figure 1. The upper panel\ntracks the price of asset 1 over time, where we have also superimposed the\nprice path of the unregulated economy (where the VaR constraint does not\nbind). As we would expect for a positive beta asset, the price path of the\nregulated economy is below the price path of the unregulated economy. This\nis a natural consequence of the fact that the VaR constraint enters as an\nincrement to the effective risk aversion of the traders. Increased effective risk\naversion implies that prices are lower. The lower panel shows the ratio of\nthe unregulated price to regulated price. Note that the price differences can\nvery substantial, ranging from zero to 40%.\n13\nFigure 2 tracks elements of the traders\u2019 forecast covariance matrix of\nreturns, \u03a3t. The upper panel reports the forecast variance for the return of\nasset 1. Note how the imposition of the VaR constraint raises the forecast\nvariance. The lower panel shows this more explicitly by reporting the ratio\nof the unregulated variance to regulated variance for asset 1. Again, as with\nprices, the differences can be rather substantial.\n4.3 A Shock\nWe now examine the impact of a large exogenous one day shock to the payoff\nrealization of asset 1. The magnitude of the shock equals the expected worst\ndaily outcome in 10 years, i.e., the expected minimum of 2,500 realizations.\nThis amount is \u22125.3. In order to accurately gauge the impact, we repeated\nthe exercise 106 times and present the averages. The VaR constraint was set\nas v\u00af = 1000.\nThe effect of the shock is rather dramatic, as can be seen in Figure 3.\nThere is a steep fall in the price after the shock, followed by a slow recovery.\nIn particular, for the first few days after the shock the crisis deepens through\nthe endogenous feedback in prices. Note, however, how the price path in\nthe regulated economy follows a steeper decline and reaches a lower trough.\nThe trough is deeper, and lasts longer in the regulated economy than in the\nunregulated one. The recovery of the price also takes longer. The bottom\npanel shows the ratio of prices across the two economies. The price ratio\nfollows a rather interesting double-humped shape, in which the maximum\ndifference in the prices follow rather late after the shock. At its maximum,\nthe price ratio is almost 20%.\nFigure 4 plots the corresponding changes in the perceived volatilities in\nthe economy in terms of the determinants of the forecast covariance matrices\n{St}. The regulated economy with the VaR constraint has substantially\nhigher values of |St|, thereby inducing the traders to take more conservative\ntrading decisions, and exacerbating the dynamics further. The center panel\nplots the ratio of the determinants across the two economies. The bottom\npanel tracks the evolution over time of the average effective risk\u2013aversion, \u03a8t\nas well as the steady\u2013state effective risk\u2013aversion, i.e. without the shock.\n4.4 Tracking Effective Risk Aversion\nOne of the advantages of having an explicit model for the portfolio decisions\nof the traders is that it allows us to track the effect of a tighter VaR constraint\nthrough the economy. There are two ways of doing this. The first is through\nchanges in the average effective risk aversion \u03a8t. Figures 3 and 4 plot the\n14\n\u03a8t realizations over time following a shock. The second way to show the\neffect of tighter VaR constraints is through the effects on prices and forecast\nvariances. In figure 5, we illustrate the impact of the severity of the VaR\nconstraint on prices and perceived volatilities.\nThe solid line is the ratio of the average prices (q1+q2)\/2 averaged across\ntime. We can see that as v\u00af becomes smaller (so that the VaR constraint\nbinds more tightly), the prices in the regulated economy fall further. We have\nalready commented on the fact that when v\u00af becomes too small, equilibrium\nfails to exist in our model. For the parameters chosen in our simulations,\nthis point is reached when v\u00af hits 12. To the left of this point, equilibrium\ndoes not exist. At the opposite extreme, we can see that as v\u00af \u2192 \u221e, the\nconstrained and unconstrained economies converge.\nAlso depicted in figure 5 is the ratio of determinants for the regulated\nand unregulated economies, as a function of v\u00af. As we would expect, the\ndifferences in forecast volatility becomes very large when v\u00af is small. As\nv\u00af \u2192\u221e, the difference disappears.\nIn figure 6, we plot an investor\u2019s effective risk aversion \u03b1h + \u03c6ht as a\nfunction of both the VaR constraint log v\u00af but also of the population risk-\naversion parameter \u03b1h (recall that the population \u03b1h is distributed uniformly\non the interval [\u0003, 1]). The kink in the surface marks the boundary where the\nVaR constraint \u201ckicks in\u201d (i.e. starts to bind). When a trader has a high\nvalue of \u03b1h, then the VaR constraint does not bind, and hence does not affect\nthe economy.\n5 Conclusions\nThe issues examined in our paper are eerily reminiscent of the debate in the\n1970s arising from the Lucas Critique, (see Lucas, 1976) . The main lesson\ndrawn by macroeconomic forecasters then was that one should distinguish\nbetween reduced form regularities (which are liable to break down when be-\nhavior changes) from genuinely structural relations of the economy. The fail-\nure to distinguish properly between the two lead to unjustifiable conclusions\nconcerning the consequences of policy. This point is succinctly summarized\nin Goodhart\u2019s Law :\n\u201cAny statistical relationship will break down when used for policy\npurposes\u201d (Goodhart, 1974)\nTo canny traders, this is a rather obvious and banal point, and the fixed\nincome and FX pages of the press and news services abound with references\n15\nto strategic trading terms such as overhangs of leveraged positions, short\u2013\ncovering and the like. So, it is clear that traders recognize the endogenous\nnature of market risk, even if their risk management systems do not. The\nneglect of the endogenous nature of risk in risk management models is all\nthe more puzzling when set against the lessons drawn after the October\n1987 crash of the stock market. The Brady Commission (1988) attributed\nthe magnitude and swiftness of the price decline to practices such as port-\nfolio insurance and dynamic hedging techniques. Such trading techniques\nhave the property that they dictate selling an asset when its price falls and\nbuying it when the price rises. Best estimates at the time suggested that\naround $100 billion in funds were following formal portfolio insurance pro-\ngrams, representing around 3% of the pre\u2013crash market value. However, this\nis almost certainly an underestimate of total selling pressure arising from in-\nformal hedging techniques such as stop\u2013loss orders, see the survey evidence\npresented in Shiller (1987). Portfolio insurance has been discussed e.g. by\nGrossman and Vila (1989), Gennotte and Leland (1990), Basak and Shapiro\n(1995), and Grossman and Zhou (1996). The events of the summer and\nautumn of 1998 in which financial markets experienced severe disruptions\nto liquidity and risk appetite can only be satisfactorily understood if the\nendogeneity of financial risk is taken into account.\nThe exercise in this paper has uncovered some unsettling side-effects\nof imposing value\u2013at\u2013risk constraints in an economy where traders follow\nbackward\u2013looking belief revision rules. Far from stabilizing prices, the effect\nof such constraints is to induce behavior that exacerbates the shocks further.\nOf course, the rationale for regulatory capital remains valid even if our ar-\nguments are taken on board. Our simulations do not consider the agency\nproblems in financial institutions and the associated incentive issues. Nor\nhave we addressed the consumer protection mandate of the regulator. The\noverall case for risk regulation must be based on a cost-benefit analysis in\nwhich the limitations to risk-taking behavior is set against the possible dam-\nage done by the endogenously generated risk that arises from risk regulation.\nOur purpose in this paper is to contribute to a fully informed debate on the\nissue by highlighting the endogenous nature of risk when market participants\nare faced with regulatory constraints.\n16\nReferences\nBasak, S. and Shapiro, A.
