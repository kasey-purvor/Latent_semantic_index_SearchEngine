We examined this process at the molecular level, to identify 19 \nprocesses that are affected when passing a photoperiodic threshold. Antarctic krill captured in 20 \nthe austral autumn were divided into two groups and immediately incubated either under a 21 \nphotoperiod of 12 hours light: 12 hours darkness (LD), simulating the natural light cycle, or 22 \nin continuous darkness (DD), simulating winter.

We 27 \nfound a difference in gene expression between LD and DD krill, with LD krill expressing 28 \nmore genes involved in functions such as metabolism, motor activity, protein binding and 29 \nvarious other cellular activities. Eleven of these genes were examined further with 30 \nquantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses, which revealed that expression levels were 31 \nsignificantly higher in LD krill. The genes affected by simulated photoperiodic change are 32 \nconsistent with known features of quiescence, such as a slowing of moult rate, a lowering of 33 \nactivity levels and a reduction in metabolic rate. The expression of proteases involved in 34 \napolysis, where the old cuticle separates from the epidermis, showed particular sensitivity to 35 \nphotoperiod and point to the mechanism by which moult rate is adjusted seasonally. Our 36 \nresults show that key processes are already responding at the molecular level after just 7 days 37 \nof exposure to a changed photoperiodic cycle. We propose that krill switch rapidly between 38 \nactive and quiescent states and that the photoperiodic cycle plays a key role in this process.  39 \n 40 \nKey words: euphausiid; moulting; overwintering; photoperiod; quiescence; Southern Ocean. 41 \n42 \n3\n \nIntroduction 43 \n 44 \nDue to their high latitude, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) must endure extreme 45 \nseasonality, with phytoplankton blooms filling only a few short summer months. The rest of 46 \nthe year is characterised by food-shortage, an encroaching ice-pack and long periods of 47 \ndarkness. Life-cycle strategies in these environments must include a means of saving energy 48 \nduring the non-productive periods (Dahms 1995). As a result, a number of key marine 49 \nplankton taxa in the Southern Ocean exhibit some sort of reduced activity during the winter 50 \nmonths. The calanoid copepods Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas, for instance, enter 51 \na classic diapause (Hirche 1996) where they arrest development, lower metabolism, reduce 52 \nlevels of activity and descend to great depths (Schnack-Shiel and Hagen 1994). The strategy 53 \nof Antarctic krill (E. superba) is less clear-cut since, despite the potentially large energy 54 \nshortfall, they remain within the upper water column during the winter (Godlewska 1996). 55 \n 56 \nSome have proposed that, in the absence of preferred foods such as diatoms, Antarctic krill 57 \nswitch to alternative food sources, such as ice biota (Marschall, 1988), zooplankton (Huntley 58 \net al., 1994) and seafloor detritus (Kawaguchi et al., 1986). However, feeding experiments on 59 \nE. superba during autumn in the Lazarev Sea (Atkinson et al., 2002) found that oxygen 60 \nuptake and clearance rates were three times lower than in summer (Atkinson and Snyder, 61 \n1997). Quetin et al. (2003) found that growth rates of larval and juvenile krill were minimal 62 \nin early winter. Moult rate in adult Antarctic krill has been observed to slow down or even 63 \nstop during winter-time (Clarke 1976). It therefore appears that krill can potentially employ a 64 \nding activity, metabolism and 65 \ngrowth to outlast the winter period.  66 \n 67 \n4\n \nIn line with the definitions used with respect to dormancy in insects (Danks 1987), we use the 68 \nterm quiescence here to mean a type of dormancy in which life-processes are retarded in 69 \ndirect response to a limiting factor (e.g. low temperature, limiting food) without prior 70 \nacclimation. This distinguishes it from diapause, which is an arrest in development that may 71 \nbe triggered by environmental factors and is compulsory and ultimately genetically 72 \ndetermined. Both the onset of quiescence and diapause may be triggered by a variety of cues, 73 \nincluding chemical (Slusarczyk and Rygielska, 2004, Pijanowska and Stolpe, 1996), thermal 74 \n(Jewson et al., 2008) and photoperiodic (Chinnery and Williams, 2003). Others have 75 \nproposed the involvement of internal clocks, such as Tande and Hopkins (1981), who linked 76 \nthe timing of the re-appearance of the calanoid copepod, Calanus finmarchicus in surface 77 \nwaters to the gradual development of the gonads over winter. Nevertheless, internal clocks 78 \nare frequently synchronised by external cues, or zeitgebers (Buchholz 1991). If krill do 79 \nalternate between distinct physiological states in response to productive and non-productive 80 \nseasons, it is likely that there is a cue which triggers this change of state. 81 \n 82 \nTeschke et al. (2007, 2008) focused on photoperiod as a potential cue by which key life-cycle 83 \nprocesses in Antarctic krill are co-ordinated, based on evidence by Hirano et al. (2003) of its 84 \ninvolvement in maturation and spawning. Winter-time krill were exposed to three different 85 \nphotoperiod cycles, continuous darkness (DD), 12 hours light: 12 hours darkness (LD) and 86 \ncontinuous light (LL) for three months. Constant temperature was maintained and food was 87 \nkept abundant across all incubations. Results showed a marked difference in the state of those 88 \nkrill kept in DD compared with those exposed to LL or LD, with individuals maintained in 89 \nLL or LD showing increased rates of metabolism (oxygen uptake rates, metabolic enzyme 90 \nactivity) and feeding activity (digestive gland size, clearance rate, digestive enzyme activity), 91 \nand the development of external secondary sexual organs. These experiments suggest, firstly, 92 \n5\n \nthat krill switch between active and quiescent physiological states and, secondly, that 93 \nphotoperiodic cycles are a major cue in causing this switch. 94 \n 95 \nMolecular approaches are a useful way of examining the processes involved in switching 96 \nbetween physiological states since they foretell the physiological changes that will 97 \nsubsequently occur. In one of the only studies on gene expression during diapause in marine 98 \nzooplankton, Tarrant et al. (2008) examined the differences in gene expression between 99 \nactive and diapausing C. finmarchicus. They found that genes associated with lipid synthesis, 100 \ntransport and storage were more highly expressed in active copepods, while diapausing 101 \ncopepods showed greater expression of the gene ferritin, encoding for an iron sequestering 102 \nprotein that also acts as a molecular chaperone; properties that may help protect cells from 103 \noxidative and thermal stress (Chen et al. 2007). 104 \n 105 \nUnderlying the approach of Tarrant et al. (2008) were two key techniques: suppression 106 \nsubtractive hybridisation (SSH) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). SSH is a means of comparing 107 \nthe genes that are expressed by two populations exposed to different conditions and 108 \nmaximising the identification of genes uniquely expressed in one or other population. qPCR 109 \nis then employed to determine to what degree a gene is differentially expressed between 110 \npopulations. The use of these techniques is now widespread and, in addition to the study of 111 \nTarrant et al. (2008), have been used to examine dauer larvae in the nematode Caenorhabditis 112 \nelegans (Cherkasova et al. 2000) and diapause in the mosquito, Culex pipens (Robich et al. 113 \n2007). 114 \n 115 \nIn this study, we investigated how gene transcription changes during the transition from 116 \nsummer-time activity to winter-time quiescence in Antarctic krill. Krill caught in autumn 117 \n6\n \nwere exposed to either, 12 hours light: 12 hours darkness (LD), simulating autumn, or 118 \ncontinuous darkness (DD), simulating winter, for seven days. SSH and qPCR were then used 119 \nto identify genes that were differentially expressed between the two populations and to 120 \ncharacterise the level of up or down regulation. The probable function of these genes within 121 \nphysiological processes was investigated through database searches and comparison to 122 \nhomologues in other organisms. This study represents one the first applications of genomic 123 \ntools to understand the regulation of physiological processes in Antarctic krill.  124 \n125 \n7\n \nMaterials and methods 126 \n 127 \nExperimental design 128 \nLive Euphausia superba were collected using a Rectangular Midwater Trawl net (RMT1+ 8) 129 \n130 \nPolarstern (ANTXXI-4). Immediately after capture, adult krill of mixed sex were transferred 131 \ninto 65 L tanks (30 krill in each) filled with natural sea water, which were located in separate 132 \nconstant temperature rooms at 0 \u00b0C. Photoperiod and light intensity were controlled in each 133 \nroom by a PC-controlled timer system. The tanks were exposed to one of the following light 134 \nregimes to simulate Southern Ocean autumn and winter conditions respectively: experimental 135 \ntank (1) autumn: 12 hours light and 12 hours darkness (LD) with a maximum of 50 lux light 136 \nintensity at the surface of the tank during midday; and experimental tank (2) winter: 137 \ncontinuous darkness (DD) (Fig. 1). 50% of the incubation water was exchanged daily. Twice 138 \na day, moults and a small number of dead animals were removed from the tanks. After 7 days 139 \nof adaptation to these conditions, three krill were sub-sampled every 4 hours from each 140 \nexperimental tank over a 24 hour time period. In total, 21 krill were extracted from each tank. 141 \nSampled krill were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C for further 142 \nanalyses. Sampling during dark periods was performed in dim red light. 143 \n 144 \nSSH library construction 145 \nTotal RNA was extracted from the heads of frozen (-80 \u00baC) E. superba using the RNeasy 146 \n-147 \ntreated water and the concentration determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer 148 \n(LabTech International). Total RNA was pooled from 21 LD krill and 21 DD krill before 149 \nisolating mRNA from each pool using a MicroPoly(A) Purist150 \n8\n \nEach pool of krill consisted of three krill sampled every four hours, over a 24 hour time 151 \nperiod. One microgram of LD and DD mRNA was used in the construction of a SSH library 152 \nusing the PCR-153 \ninstructions, in which LD cDNA was the tester and DD cDNA was the driver. In addition to 154 \nthe SSH library, a library was also made of Rsa I digested LD cDNA that had not undergone 155 \nsubtraction with DD cDNA to act as a control. Subtracted and non-subtracted cDNAs were 156 \ncloned into pGEM\u00ae-T Easy (Promega) before being transformed to Escherichia coli XL2-157 \n158 \nselection were grown in 100 \u00b5l TB medium overnight in 96 well plates and 40 \u00b5l 50% 159 \nglycerol added before storing at -80 \u00baC.  160 \n 161 \ncDNA sequencing 162 \nPrior to sequencing, the inserts of each clone were amplified and purified according to the 163 \nymerase mix and 164 \n2 (Bioline).

Only high quality sequences more than 150 bp in length were used for database 174 \nsearching. In order to examine sequence similarity to known genes, Blastx (Altschul et al., 175 \n9\n \n1997) was used to search Swissprot, Trembl and non-redundant (nr) sequence databases for 176 \nsignificant matches. A significant database search was defined as having an expectation value 177 \n(E-value) below 1e-5. All sequences with an E-value below 1e-10 were further annotated using 178 \nGO terms and GO slims (The Gene Consortium, 2000). GO enrichment was determined by a 179 \none-tailed proportion test at a p value of less than 0.05 that compared the proportion of clones 180 \nrepresenting a GO slim term in the subtracted library to the proportion of clones representing 181 \nthe same GO slim term in the unsubtracted library. High quality sequences were submitted to 182 \ndbEST (Boguski et al., 1993) and given the following accession numbers: dbEST: 60125367-183 \n60126646, Genbank: FL688135- FL689414. 184 \n 185 \nQuantitative PCR 186 \nqPCR sample sets: Two sets of qPCR analysis were performed to compare gene expression 187 \nbetween LD and DD krill. 188 \n  1. Pooled krill analysis: The expression of 11 genes selected from the SSH library based on 189 \ntheir known, or proposed involvement in moulting, metabolism and motor activity (Table 1) 190 \nwas compared between the same pools of LD and DD krill (each consisting of 21 krill 191 \nsampled over a 24 hour period) used in the SSH library construction. 192 \n  2. Individual krill analysis: qPCR analysis of a subset of the above 11 genes was performed 193 \non individual krill from the LD and DD regimes. Each krill was measured for uropod length, 194 \nsex and maturity where possible (following Makarov and Denys 1980), and moult stage 195 \n(following Buchholz 1982). Given that some of the largest differences in gene expression 196 \nfrom the pooled-krill analysis were in genes proposed to be involved in moulting (see 197 \nResults), krill were sorted according to moult stage and compared between LD and DD light 198 \nregimes. Specifically, we focussed on the stages around apolysis (the point at which the 199 \ncuticle separates from the epidermis). Stage C (or intermoult) occurs immediately before 200 \n10\n \napolysis and D0 (or 1st stage premoult), at the point of apolysis and just after (Fig. 2). We 201 \nmade a number of comparisons to examine how gene expression alters between these two 202 \nmoult stages and how this is affected by the photoperiodic cycle (Table 2).  203 \n 204 \nPrimers were designed around the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) of interest, using Primer 3 205 \n(Rozen and Skaletsky, 2000) to generate PCR products of between 100 and 200 bp (Table 3). 206 \nTo normalise the data, primers were also designed against ESTs with significant homology to 207 \nthe following three potential reference genes; beta actin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 208 \ndehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK). Beta actin 209 \nwas found to be the most stable in the pooled krill analysis, while PEP-CK changed the least 210 \nin the individual krill analysis.  211 \n 212 \nqPCR methodology: One microgram of total RNA was used to make first strand cDNA using 213 \na Quantitect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen) that incorporates genomic DNA removal 214 \nprior to reverse transcription. The cDNA (20 \u00b5l) was diluted to 80 \u00b5l and 1 \u00b5l was used as 215 \ntemplate for qPCR. The qPCR mixture consisted of 10 \u00b5l 2 x SensiMixPlus SYBR 216 \nmastermix (Quantace), 600 nM of forward and reverse primers, 1 \u00b5l cDNA and sterile MilliQ 217 \nwater in a total volume of 20 \u00b5l. The qPCRs were performed in duplicate on a Mx3000P 218 \nQPCR system (Agilent Technologies) with the following cycling conditions: 95 \u00baC for 10 219 \nmin, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00baC for 30 sec, 60 \u00baC for 1 min and 72 \u00baC for 30 sec. A 220 \ndissociation curve step was then performed to ensure that only a single product had been 221 \namplified in each reaction. Standard curves were performed for each primer pair with a 222 \ndilution series of cDNA. By plotting threshold crossing cycle (Ct) values against the log10 of 223 \nthe different dilutions, PCR efficiency was calculated as E = 10(-1\/slope) 1, using MxPro  224 \n(Agilent Technologies) software. Relative mean expression ratios were statistically compared 225 \n11\n \nbetween light regimes (LD and DD) and moult stages (C and D0) following normalisation 226 \nagainst the reference gene using the relative expression software tool REST (Pfaffl et al. 227 \n2002). For statistical analysis of relative mean expression ratios, REST employs 228 \nrandomisation tests with a pair-wise reallocation that make no assumptions about the 229 \ndistribution of observations in populations. The software was used to perform 2000 random 230 \nallocations to determine if the results were due to chance or to the effects of the treatment 231 \n(light regime or moult stage), with differences considered to be significant at P <0.05. 232 \n 233 \n 234 \n235 \n12\n \nResults 236 \n 237 \nSSH library analysis 238 \nA krill LD SSH library was constructed along with an unsubtracted LD library in which no 239 \nsubtraction with DD krill was performed. This allowed a comparison to be made between 240 \nsubtracted and unsubtracted libraries that would indicate which genes were enriched by the 241 \nsubtraction with the DD krill. From each library, 960 clones were sequenced that resulted in 242 \n595 and 685 high quality sequences longer than 150 bp from the subtracted and unsubtracted 243 \nlibraries respectively (Table 4). A comparison with the ESTs published in the first sequencing 244 \nstudy of Euphausia superba (De Pitt\u00e0 et al., 2008) showed that 581 of these sequences were 245 \nnovel. Following sequence matching to NCBI databases using Blastx, of the putative 246 \nmRNAs, 225 (48%) and 232 (40%) could be identified from the subtracted and unsubtracted 247 \nlibraries respectively (E <1e-5). Identified genes with an E-value of less than 1e-10 were then 248 \nannotated using GO slims (a database of simplified gene ontology descriptions) from the 249 \nGene Ontology Consortium and placed into different functional categories (Table 5). This 250 \ntable shows that metabolism, protein binding and various other cellular activities are enriched 251 \nin the subtracted library that may correspond to higher expression of genes in these categories 252 \nin LD krill. 253 \n 254 \nQuantitative PCR analysis 255 \nTo measure the level of differential gene expression between LD and DD incubated krill, 256 \nqPCR was first performed on 11 genes selected from the SSH library based on their known, 257 \nor proposed, involvement in moulting, metabolism and motor activity (Table 1). The list 258 \nincludes five enzymes and three enzyme precursors. Of the enzymes, aldo-keto reductase and 259 \nfructose-bisphosphate aldolase are involved in carbohydrate metabolism (Gabbay and Tze, 260 \n13\n \n1972; Salvatore et al., 1986; Bagnasco et al., 1987), while -N-acetylglucosaminidase has 261 \nbeen shown to be involved in the degradation of the old cuticle during moulting (Samuels and 262 \nReynolds, 1993). CUB-serine protease was included as serine proteases have been found in 263 \nthe moulting fluid of insects (Samuels et al., 1993) and are thought to be involved in the 264 \ndigestion of the old cuticle during the apolysis stage prior to moulting. Trypsin is known to 265 \nbe involved in food protein digestion (Diaz-Mendoza et al., 2005) but it also has protease 266 \nproperties (Muhlia-Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2008) and has been shown to activate other proteases (Tsu 267 \nand Craik, 1996). As for the enzyme precursors, the activated pancreatic carboxypeptidase 268 \nA1 precursor is involved in moulting (Ote et al., 2005), while the activated form of the serine 269 \ncollagenase 1 precursor has protease properties (Tsu and Craik, 1996) required for 270 \ndegradation of the old cuticle. Trypsinogen is a precursor of trypsin (Neurath 1964). The 271 \nother genes in the list encode for cuticle protein CB6, required for formation of new cuticle 272 \n(Kuballa et al., 2007); myosin light chain protein, involved in motor activity (Poetter et al., 273 \n1996) and a low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein involved in both cuticle 274 \ndegradation (Yochem et al., 1999) and protease activation (Krieger and Herz, 1994; 275 \nStrickland et al., 1995). 276 \n 277 \nPooled krill analysis: All genes selected for qPCR were found to be up regulated in LD krill, 278 \nalthough there were differences in the level of up regulation (Fig. 3). Some of the largest 279 \ndifferences in gene expression were in genes proposed to be involved at various stages of the 280 \nmoulting process. In particular, large differences between LD and DD krill were observed 281 \nwith the proteases, serine collagenase, trypsin and CUB-serine protease. These results 282 \ntherefore focussed our further efforts onto the interaction between moult stage (particularly 283 \nthe time around apolysis) and photoperiod cycle within individual krill. 284 \n 285 \n14\n \nIndividual krill analysis: Three qPCR comparisons were made to reveal the effect of stage of 286 \nmoult and photoperiodic cycles on gene expression around the period of apolysis: A, the 287 \neffect of apolysis on gene expression (LD\/DD intermoult or stage C versus LD\/DD premoult 288 \nstage D0); B, the effect of photoperiod immediately before apolysis (LD stage C versus DD 289 \nstage C); C, the effect of photoperiod immediately after apolysis (LD stage D0 versus DD 290 \nstage D0). Comparisons were made for three differentially expressed genes, as identified by 291 \nthe pooled-krill analysis, with suspected involvement in the process of apolysis: serine 292 \ncollagenase, trypsin and CUB-serine protease. A fourth gene, cuticle CB6 was also included, 293 \ngiven its function in new cuticle formation: 294 \nA, there was no significant change in the expression of serine collagenase, trypsin and CUB-295 \nserine protease before and after apolysis. However, there was a significant up regulation of 296 \ncuticle CB6 after apolysis (Fig. 4a). 297 \nB, serine collagenase, trypsin and CUB-serine protease expression were down regulated 298 \nsignificantly (p<0.05) in DD stage C krill compared with LD stage C krill. Trypsin showed a 299 \n200 fold down-regulation in DD krill and serine collagenase, a 140 fold down regulation. 300 \nThere was little difference in the expression of cuticle CB6 (Fig. 4b). 301 \nC, none of the genes showed a significant change in expression between photoperiod regimes 302 \nimmediately after apolysis i.e. stage D0 (Fig. 4c).  303 \n 304 \nThe results reveal a complex picture of up- and down-regulation of genes depending on both 305 \nphotoperiod and moult-stage relative to the point of apolysis. Photoperiod affected the 306 \nexpression of protease genes (serine collagenase, trypsin and CUB-serine protease) only prior 307 \nto apolysis (stage C) and not after apolysis has occurred (stage D0). Furthermore, post-308 \napolysis, the formation of a new cuticle (as indicated by the expression of cuticle CB6) 309 \ncontinues irrespective of the photoperiodic cycle. Overall, the DD treatment appeared to 310 \n15\n \nslow-down or even halt processes leading up to apolysis but had little effect on individuals 311 \nthat were post-apolysis and already making preparations for the next moult.  312 \n 313 \n314 \n16\n \nDiscussion 315 \nAnalytical approach 316 \nThe annotation of identified genes with Gene Ontology categories allowed a comparison of 317 \nbiochemical pathways and physiological processes to be made between the subtracted (SSH) 318 \nand unsubtracted libraries. This comparison showed that the subtracted library was enriched 319 \nfor genes involved in processes such as metabolism, protein binding, signalling, motor 320 \nactivity and gene transcription and translation. Some of the metabolic genes, such as those 321 \nencoding for trypsin and carboxypeptidase, were also involved in moulting. These results 322 \nindicate that a number of genes encoding for proteins involved in growth, feeding and 323 \nswimming activity were expressed at levels greater in krill incubated in a LD photoperiod 324 \nthan in krill incubated in a DD photoperiod. To clarify the differences in gene expression 325 \nbetween LD and DD krill further, qPCR was used on 11 genes highlighted by the SSH 326 \nprocedure that were linked to moulting, feeding and motor activity (Table 1). All 11 genes 327 \nselected from the SSH library for qPCR were found to have expression levels higher in 328 \npooled LD krill compared to pooled DD krill. Of these, the expression of eight genes showed 329 \nmore than a two fold difference, which is traditionally used as a significance threshold for 330 \nexpression levels (Leung and Cavalieri, 2003).  331 \n 332 \nFunctions of genes 333 \nThe most striking differential gene expression patterns were shown by the proteases, serine 334 \ncollagenase precursor, trypsin, and CUB-serine protease. Proteases play a major role in the 335 \ndigestive system of invertebrates (Muhlia-Almaz\u00e1n et al. 2008), and have been found in the 336 \nmoulting fluid of insects (Samuels et al., 1993) and crustaceans (Warner and Matheson, 337 \n1998) where they have been shown to degrade insect cuticle (Samuels et al., 1993). Although 338 \ntrypsin itself has not been shown to degrade cuticle, Klein et al. (1996) found that both 339 \n17\n \ntrypsin mRNA and trypsin enzyme activity were at their highest levels during premoult (stage 340 \nD1) of the shrimp Penaeus vannamei. 341 \n 342 \nIt is known that during premoult in crustaceans (stages D0 to D3), the old cuticle is digested 343 \nand reabsorbed to recycle nutrients (Buchholz and Buchholz, 1989). The cuticle of E. 344 \nsuperba consists of epicuticle, exocuticle and endocuticle, with these last two layers built up 345 \nof stacks of laminae that consist of protein and chitin (Buchholz and Buchholz, 1989). It has 346 \nbeen proposed that, in order for the cuticle to be digested during premoult, proteases are 347 \nneeded to degrade the protein protecting the chitin microfibers. Chitinases, such as -N-348 \nacetylglucosaminidase, can then digest the microfibers (Bade and Stinson, 1979; Fukamizo 349 \nand Kramer, 1985).  350 \n 351 \nThe low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), found to be expressed at twice the 352 \nlevel in LD versus DD krill, is known to be involved in the degradation of the old cuticle 353 \n(Yochem et al. 1999). LRPs are also known to regulate the activity of extracellular proteases 354 \n(Krieger and Herz, 1994; Strickland et al., 1995) and so the LRP here may be required for 355 \nactivation of the protease trypsin, that in turn is required for activation of trypsinogen 356 \n(Neurath, 1964), the serine collagenase precursor (Tsu and Craik, 1996) and pancreatic 357 \ncarboxypeptidase A1 precursor (Bayes et al., 2003). 358 \n 359 \nOther genes found to be up regulated in the LD krill are involved in carbohydrate metabolism 360 \nand motor activity. Aldo-keto reductase and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase are both involved 361 \nin glycolysis, the initial process of carbohydrate catabolism (Gabbay and Tze, 1972; Hanson 362 \nand Garber, 1972; Salvatore et al., 1986), and may indicate that the LD krill require more 363 \nenergy than the DD krill. This is supported by an increase in expression of myosin light chain 364 \n18\n \nmRNA, a gene involved in muscle contraction (Poetter et al., 1996), suggesting that the LD 365 \nkrill are more active than the DD krill and so require a greater energy supply. 366 \n 367 \nThe pooled-krill qPCR analysis revealed several effects of photoperiod on physiological 368 \nprocesses. Two carbohydrate metabolic genes involved in the glycolysis pathway were less 369 \nactive in DD krill, even though the feeding environment was identical to that of LD krill (i.e. 370 \nnatural seawater exchanged every 24 h). Morris and Priddle (1984) found that the amount of 371 \nfood in alimentary tracts decreased during wintertime, and suggested this was a function both 372 \nof the level of feeding activity and the availability of food. Similarly, Quetin et al. (2003) 373 \nconcluded that daylength acting on both behavior and primary production explained 74% of 374 \nthe variation in larval and juvenile growth rates. The contrary explanation, that daylength has 375 \na direct effect on physiological state, is otherwise supported by Atkinson et al. (2002), who 376 \nfound that late autumn krill ingested at only low rates even when offered high concentration 377 \nof food. Our results would support that latter explanation in that, on receipt of an appropriate 378 \nphotoperiodic cue, krill no longer maintain physiological processes capable of digesting food. 379 \nThis potentially reduces the cost of maintaining such systems during a time of year when 380 \nfood is traditionally less available. Entry into this state potentially overrides local cues 381 \nregarding sporadic increases in feeding conditions, at least over short time intervals.  382 \n 383 \nThis analysis also found that gene expression of myosin, which is involved in motor activity, 384 \nwas lower in krill exposed to DD than LD conditions. This may have a more immediate 385 \nexplanation. Krill use light cues in order to synchronise upward and downward vertical 386 \nmigrations. Under DD conditions, there is an absence of such cues and swimming activity 387 \ncould cease. Nevertheless, Gaten et al. (2008) has demonstrated the existence of innate 388 \nrhythms of activity and inactivity in the absence of any light cues, which persist over a 389 \n19\n \nnumber of days. What may be more the issue in the present study is that the level of activity 390 \nis much less under DD conditions, independent of any internal clock. 391 \n 392 \nInteraction between photoperiod and the moult cycle  393 \nThe individual krill qPCR analysis further highlighted some specific interactions between 394 \nphotoperiod and the moult cycle. In particular, we found that photoperiod affected the 395 \nexpression of protease genes (serine collagenase, trypsin and CUB-serine protease) in certain 396 \nmoult stages only. Specifically, there was a significant down-regulation in expression of 397 \nprotease genes in moult stage C in the DD photoperiod compared to the LD photoperiod, but 398 \nno such down-regulation in moult stage D0 between photoperiods.  Furthermore, cuticle CB6 399 \ngene, which is involved in the formation of the new cuticle and only expressed after apolysis 400 \n(Fig. 3), did not appear to be affected by photoperiod. Serine collagenase, trypsin and CUB-401 \nserine protease are all likely to be involved in the break-down of cuticle (Samuels et al. 1993, 402 \nKlein et al. 1996, Warner and Matheson 1998) and so probably play an important role in the 403 \nprocess of apolysis, when the cuticle separates from the epidermis and the first stages of old 404 \ncuticle degradation begins.  Our results indicate that the DD photoperiod slowed-down or 405 \neven halted processes necessary for apolysis. This, in turn, implies that relatively short-term 406 \nexposure to continuous darkness is sufficient to slow down or even halt the moult cycle. 407 \nApolysis appears to be a gate through which the moult cycle continues under natural 408 \nactivities but at which the cycle is halted when exposed to cues such as continuous darkness 409 \n(Fig. 2).  410 \n 411 \nThe observation that moulting is one of the first processes to be down-regulated after 7 days 412 \nof darkness is not entirely expected. Moulting continues throughout adult life and is believed 413 \nto occur in winter as well as summer (Buchholz, 1991, Quetin et al., 2003). However, Clarke 414 \n20\n \n(1976), Morris and Priddle (1984) and Buchholz et al. (1989) all report a lowering of moult 415 \nrate in Antarctic krill during winter-time, corresponding to period when there is little or no 416 \nlight. Morris and Priddle (1984) also report that there was an increased proportion of krill in 417 \nintermoult during this time. This agrees with the present study in terms of individuals not 418 \nprogressing through apolysis when entering a stage of winter-time quiescence.  419 \n 420 \nSignificance of findings 421 \nOverall, our findings indicate: 422 \n1) that even 7 days of exposure to different photoperiodic cues during autumn produce a 423 \nsignificant change in the transcription of genes underlying a number of physiological 424 \nprocesses, including protease activity, cuticle degradation, cuticle formation, protein 425 \ndigestion, glucose metabolism, and muscle contraction 426 \n2) that many of these processes are consistent with known features of quiescence, 427 \nparticularly the slowing of moult rate, feeding and swimming activity. 428 \n 429 \nSpeculation on the use of cues by krill to alternate between active and quiescent stages was 430 \npartially addressed by Teschke et al. (2007, 2008) whose incubations in different 431 \nphotoperiodic conditions were carried out over several months. The purpose of the present 432 \nstudy was to examine whether a response to photoperiodic conditions could also be initiated 433 \nover a shorter time interval. At 65 \u00b0S, the period of daylight decreases by 7 minutes per day, 434 \nor 49 minutes per week, as one passes from autumn to winter. It is therefore possible that a 435 \nset threshold may be passed within the period of a week and physiological cascades of non-436 \nessential processes become halted quickly. Although our experiments take krill to the 437 \nextreme of continuous darkness, we demonstrate that these organisms are capable of halting 438 \nprocesses within a matter of days. Although a number of studies have investigated the 439 \n21\n \nprocess of dormancy in marine zooplankton (Dahms, 1995; Hirche, 1996), this is one of the 440 \nfirst to establish that the onset of quiescence in Antarctic krill may be particularly rapid once 441 \nappropriate cues have been received.  442 \n 443 \nIn conclusion, this study has shown that the gene expression underlying activities such as 444 \nmoulting, feeding and swimming is reduced in Antarctic krill after seven days exposure to a 445 \nwinter-time photoperiodic cycle. This reduction in activity levels is consistent with the 446 \nfeatures of quiescence. We support the view that photoperiod plays an important role in 447 \ninitiating the transition between active and quiescent states. Furthermore, we propose that this 448 \ntransition can be initiated within a few days of crossing a photoperiodic threshold.  449 \n 450 \n 451 \nAcknowledgements 452 \nWe would like to thank the captain and crew of RV Polarstern during ANTXXI-4 cruise.
