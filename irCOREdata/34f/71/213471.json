THE SLOW MARCH OF DIRECT ELECTIONS \nBy Jude Howell (China Quarterly 2008) \n \nSince the mid-1990s trade union leaders in Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shandong and other \ncoastal provinces have been quietly introducing direct elections for grassroots trade \nunion cadres. Their goal has been to nurture a stratum of grassroots trade union cadres \nwho prioritise workers\u2019 interests over Party and\/or national interests. In essence it is a \nsubtle attempt to democratise the trade union from within, transforming it from an \nadministrative machine subservient to the Party into an effective organisation for \ninterest group representation. In many respects direct trade union elections echo the \nidea of competitive village leadership elections. Yet they have not been generalised \nacross the country or institutionalised through legislation or drawn droves of \ninternational observers in the way that village elections did in the 1980s and 1990s. \nWhat might have promised to be China\u2019s `second silent revolution\u2019 has failed to take \noff. This paper explores the political, structural and institutional reasons behind the \npiecemeal and slow spread of direct basic union elections in China. In doing so it \nanalyses the parameters constraining the reform of the All-China Federation of Trades \nUnions (ACFTU) in the direction of a more effective, worker-oriented organisation. \n \nThe paper begins by identifying the key organisational features of the ACFTU that \nframe trade union activism and distinguish it from trade unions in liberal democratic \ncontexts. The most salient of these are Leninist classic dualism, state corporatism and \nbureaucratic welfarism, features that, as will be seen, are potentially challenged in one \nfell swoop by direct elections for grassroots trade union cadres. In the second section \nwe examine the arguments levered by reformist leaders within the ACFTU to push the \nidea of direct elections of basic trade union cadres in China. In the third section we \nanalyse the complex nexus of structural, institutional and political factors that have \ncombined to thwart the widespread implementation and institutionalisation of direct \nelections of grassroots trade union cadres in China.  \n \nThe paper draws on the findings of fieldwork carried out in 2003 and 2004 in Beijing \nand two southern provinces, which have spearheaded experiments with direct \ndemocratic elections.  The research focuses on the perspectives of trade union cadres \nFormatted: Left:  3.17 cm, Right: \n3.17 cm, Header distance from edge: \n1.25 cm, Footer distance from edge: \n1.25 cm\non the processes of change within the ACFTU, and specifically regarding direct \nelections. Twenty-three in-depth, qualitative interviews were conducted with relevant \nkey informants in provincial, town and enterprise trade unions. Though not a \nrepresentative sample for all of China, the interviews in these provinces pioneering \ndirect elections illustrate the constraints and possibilities for organisational change\ni\n. \n \nThroughout the paper the term `direct elections\u2019 (zhijie xuanju) refers to the process \nwhereby workers nominate any number of candidates to stand for trade union \npositions such as trade union committee member, vice-chair and chair. This echoes \nthe `sea elections\u2019 (haixuan) method pioneered in village elections and was \nconsidered by our informants to be the most democratic. Workers then vote directly \nfor their preferred candidates, who should muster more than half of the vote, again \nreflecting village elections. In practice direct elections embrace a range of practices, \nfrom the more democratic sea elections method to more dubious processes, reflecting \nthe contested  nature of the concept\nii\n. This system aims to replace Party control [the \nParty is the one which allows this to happen. I am not sure whether this is the aimof \nthe system as the system is controlled by the party.] over the appointment of \ngrassroots trade union cadres.  \n.    \nI. Understanding the parameters of change \n \nThere is general agreement amongst scholars that the ACFTU departs in significant \nways from trade unions in Western liberal democracies\niii\n. In particular the ACFTU is \nthe only officially recognised trade union in China and enjoys therefore a monopoly in \nthe representation of workers\u2019 interests. Given its close structural relationship with the \nChinese Communist Party (CCP), it lacks the independence of trade unions in liberal \ndemocratic states, which is vital if unions are to articulate and promote effectively the \ninterests of their members\niv\n. The growth of a significant domestic and foreign private \nmanufacturing sector, the decline of state enterprises and the massive flows of rural \nmigrant workers to the industrial heartlands of eastern China over the last three \ndecades of reform have altered fundamentally the context within which the ACFTU \noperates (Cai 2002, Chan and Zhu 2003, Chan 2000, 2001, Lee 1999, Pun 2005, Qiao \n2002, Sheehan 1998). Faced with a rising number of workers\u2019 strikes, protests, \ndemonstrations (Chen 2000, Howell 1997a, b, 2003, Lee 2007, Pan 2002, Weston \n2004, Thireau and Hua 2003) and workers\u2019 self-organising (Xie 2002, Howell 2004), \nand concerned about the threats to social stability, the CCP has urged the ACFTU to \nplay a more prominent role in protecting workers\u2019 rights, but always within the \nparameters of accepting Party leadership [But where does the Party stand? The author \nshould disuss the vantage point of the Party. If the Party stands on the side of the \nworkers, then there is no problem. .] Compared to other mass organisations such as \nthe All-China Women\u2019s Federation (ACWF) or the Communist Youth League (CYL), \nthe ACFTU has been slow to adapt to the many new challenges it faces in a rapidly \ngrowing market economy (Howell 2000).  \n \nNevertheless it would be wrong to say that the ACFTU has not changed over the past \nthirty years\nv\n, that it has not initiated and contributed to significant reforms in the \nlegislative and regulatory framework governing labour relations in China or that it has \nnot strengthened its institutional position in the administrative hierarchy\nvi\n.  As these \nchanges have already been well expounded in other texts (Chan 1993, Howell 1997a, \n2003, Taylor, Chang and Li 2003), suffice it here to highlight the key crisis moment \nin the post-reform history of the ACFTU during the democracy movement of 1989 \nwhen ACFTU leaders mediated between protesting workers and Party leaders, thereby \nbolstering their claims to represent workers\u2019 interests and disturbing the balance of \ntheir relationship with the Party\nvii\n. At the same time more radical trade union cadres \nand workers set up autonomous trade unions. Following the clampdown on the 1989 \ndemocracy movement, the ACFTU came under sharp criticism from the then \ndominant conservative faction in the Party (Wilson 1990b:61). Party leaders \nrecognised, however, that a more effective and democratic ACFTU that remained \nunder the leadership of the Party was still preferable to an independent trade union \nbeyond Party control. They astutely conceded more access to the policy-making \nprocess, greater influence in the enterprise and greater space to take up workers\u2019 \ngrievances in return for accepting Party leadership. As White, Howell and Shang \n(1996:51-52) note, this was a Faustian bargain `in which the unions linked their \nfortunes and future to those of the Party\u2019. With the re-ascendancy of Deng and his \nallies from 1992 onwards, the more progressive wing of the ACFTU emerged out of \ntheir post-Tiananmen crevices and began to push again for legislation that would \nbetter protect workers. However Party exhortation was still not enough to equip \ngrassroots trade union cadres with the political and ideological tools to handle the \nconflicting pressures from workers, Party officials and management nor enough to \nprotect them against the threat of job dismissal if they did conscientiously take the \nside of workers.  \n \nThus the process of organisational change has been slow and halting, often with one \nstep forwards and two steps backwards, and significantly shaped by political and \nideological struggles within the Party leadership, institutional and structural factors.  \nThe pressures for greater autonomy have come from radical [an over-statement to call \nthem \u201cradical\u201d. \u201cReformist\u201d is more appropriate] leaders within the ACFTU, \nsympathetic journalists and labour scholars, and from grassroots trade unionists, who \nare at the coalface of an increasingly pronounced dualist dilemma. Given the \nsensitivity of labour issues and the Party\u2019s fear of any emerging independent trade \nunion movement akin to Solidarity\nviii\n, the ACFTU, when compared to the CYL or \nACWF, confronts particularly stringent constraints on internal reform. Three \nconstraints stand out: first, the transmission belt role of the trade union and the classic \ndualist dilemma this poses; second, the state corporatist nature of the ACFTU; and \nthird, its bureaucratic welfarism. These variables shape at all levels the behaviour and \nattitudes of trade union cadres to their work and hence the effectiveness of the \norganisation in defending workers\u2019 interests.  \n \nIn his seminal work on the ACFTU Paul Harper (1969) discusses in detail the \nstructural dilemma posed by the Leninist transmission belt model of trade unionism. \nIn this model the trade union functions as an intermediary, mass organisation, \ntransmitting Party policy and directives downwards to workers and in turn reflecting \nworkers\u2019 interests upwards to the Party. As Harper and others have noted, such a \nmodel could serve the interests of workers well in an ideal world. However these twin \nobjectives, that Pravda and Ruble (1986: 1-21) refer to as `classic dualism\u2019ix, are often \ncontradictory, so that in practice, trade union cadres under pressure from above have \ntended to prioritise the interests of the Party and the nation over those of its worker \nconstituency. In the reform period these contradictory functions have become \nincreasingly difficult to reconcile, with trade union cadres being pulled and pushed in \ndifferent directions. This has been become particularly pronounced during the closure \nof state enterprises and in disputes in private sector enterprises, where trade union \ncadres have more often than not aligned with Party policy than taken up the \ngrievances of workers.  \n \nThe second key characteristic of the ACFTU is its state corporatist nature. Philippe \nSchmitter developed the idea of corporatism as a way of theoretically conceptualising \nvariations in state formations. According to Schmitter (1979: 93-94) corporatism \nrefers to:  \n \n\u201c\u2026a system of interest representation in which the constituent units are \norganised into a limited number of singular, compulsory, non-competitive, \nhierarchically ordered and functionally differentiated categories, recognised or \nlicensed (if not created) by the state and granted a deliberate representational \nmonopoly within their respective categories in exchange for observing certain \ncontrols on their selection of leaders and articulation of demands and support\u201d.  \n \nGiven that there is only one officially recognised trade union federation in China, that \nany attempts to establish alternative trade unions have always been quickly nipped in \nthe bud and that the CCP exerts considerable control over the union, then the ACFTU \ncan aptly be described as a corporatist institution. Moreover, because of the classic \ndualism noted above, the ACFTU is better described as a state corporatist institution \nrather than a societal corporatist institution\nx\n which gives precedence to the \nrepresentation of worker interests\u2019, autonomous and voluntary organisation.  \n \nLabelling the ACFTU as state corporatist is, however, static. It reveals little about \nhow an institution can move from a state to societal corporatist model or indeed to a \npluralist, civil-society type model where numerous, voluntarily formed trade unions \nvie for influence over government. Indeed Schmitter (1979:126-7) is pessimistic about \nthe possibility of any peaceful and incremental transformation from a state corporatist \nto societal corporatist regime. Pravda and Ruble (1976) are more optimistic about the \npossibilities, though concede that any move towards `adversarial non-dualism\u2019 is most \nlikely to occur in a context of radicalisation and regime challenge (p. 19). Over the \nlast fifty years there have been key moments when more radical leaders in the \nACFTU have pressed for greater autonomy from the Party so as to represent more \neffectively workers\u2019 interests. In the 1950s Li Lisan and later Lai Ruoyu, both chairs \nof the ACFTU, attempted in vain to wrest the union from Party control. Such \nmoments are historical steps in the direction of a state corporatism that tilts more \ntowards workers\u2019 interests, or in other words a `societal state corporatism\u2019. However \nit is only when there is a fundamental challenge to the regime, such as in the late \n1980s in Eastern Europe or during the Democracy Movement of 1989 in China when \nworker activists and radical trade unionists set up autonomous trade unions that the \npossibility of a shift from state to societal corporatism can come about. In the case of \nChina, such a moment was short-lived. In the absence of regime change, we can \nexpect state corporatist unions such as the ACFTU to change gradually, with periods \nof advance and retreat as the Party alternately cedes or retrieves control.  \n  \nThe third feature of the ACFTU is its bureaucratic welfarism. The ACFTU is a large, \nadministrative machine, with a membership of over 150 million. As its leaders at all \nlevels are predominantly Party members, the lines between Party and mass \norganisation are heavily blurred. At the local level leading trade union cadres are \nappointed by the local Party committee. They receive instructions and pressures from \nboth local Party authorities and from the central ACFTU, with the former usually \nwielding greater authority over local trade unionists. The incentives to cadres to \nperform well come from the Party above rather than from workers below.  \n \nUp till the reform period state and collective ownership predominated in China. Trade \nunion cadres operated like an arm of the administration in the state-led economy, a \npoint that Ni Zhifu, then Chair of the ACFTU, underlined vociferously in his speech \nat the 11\nth\n ACFTU Congress in 1988 (Wilson, 1990b: 55)\nxi\n. Their main duties were \nensuring production, safeguarding the welfare of workers, organising cultural and \nleisure activities, administering the labour insurance fund, and relaying Party policies. \nTrade unions were established in state and collective enterprises as a matter of course \nand under Maoism there could be no fundamental contradiction of interests between \nworkers and the state. Most state workers enjoyed an iron rice bowl and wages, and \nbenefits and working conditions were determined through central policies.  \nCompared with trade unions in capitalist economies, trade union cadres had no need \nto develop the skills of establishing trade unions, of mobilising workers to join a trade \nunion\nxii, of identifying and articulating workers\u2019 interests, of challenging exploitative \nmanagers, or of raising funds to support union activities. Though workers in the 1950s \nand 1960s harboured grievances that sometimes erupted into conflict (Perry 1994), the \nParty\u2019s perception of their threat to social stability cannot be compared with the \nsituation post-reform. The gradual bureaucratisation of the ACFTU over half a \ncentury and its welfarist orientation have led to an institutional inertia which has \nseriously impeded any shift towards a more societal state corporatist or civil society-\ntype organisation. Grassroots trade union cadres have therefore lacked the skills and \nincentives to deal with workplace issues that would be part and parcel of everyday \ntrade union life in liberal capitalist societies.  \n \nClassic dualism, state corporatism and bureaucratic welfarism are persistent features \nof the ACFTU that have combined to constrain any initiatives to make the union more \nrepresentative and vocal on behalf of workers\nxiii\n. Though the ACFTU has \nstrengthened its bureaucratic position considerably during the reform period and \nplayed a visible role in promoting workers\u2019 interests, it still lacks legitimacy amongst \nChinese workers and is widely held to be ineffective in representing, articulating or \nprotecting workers\u2019 rights. As Chan (1993: 58-59) noted, the efforts of trade union \nleaders to protect workers\u2019 interests since the 1980s and even their actions during the \nradical 1989 movement seemed to have made little impression on workers. Moreover \nmost foreign-owned enterprises and domestic private enterprises do not have any \ntrade union representation. Even where trade union branches exist in the private sector, \nthe chairs are frequently relatives or friends appointed by the owner. Trade union \ncadres generally have little role in organising the increasing number of spontaneous \nstrikes and protests across China around unpaid wages, excessive overtime or \nenterprise closures. Many migrant workers have no idea what the role of the ACFTU \nis and do not see themselves as part of the Chinese working class because of their \nrural origins. There are thus two deep gaps: first, between the actual efforts made by \nthe ACFTU to reform, albeit piecemeal and slow, and the perception of these by \nworkers; and second, between the legislative reforms and other initiatives that have \nbeen pushed by the ACFTU to protect workers\u2019 rights and the role of trade unions in \nensuring their implementation.  \n \nIt is against this background that the move towards direct elections looks particularly \ninnovative and promising for workers. Unlike other attempts at reform within the \nACFTU, direct elections aim to change the very nature of grassroots trade union \ncadres by making them accountable to workers. In doing so they would knock on the \nhead the three key constraints outlined above. First, by making grassroots trade union \ncadres answerable to workers, this would increase the pressure on cadres to prioritise \nworkers\u2019 interests, thus addressing the classic dualist dilemma. Second, with cadres \nbecoming more responsive to workers the elections could provide a way of shifting \nthe union towards a more societal version of state corporatism or even towards a civil-\nsociety type institution. Third, with incentives geared towards meeting workers\u2019 \ninterests rather than bureaucratic orders and towards addressing workers\u2019 grievances \nin the workplace rather than just administering welfare, the elections would provide a \nmechanism for undermining bureaucratic welfarism. In the next section we examine \nmore closely the rationale behind direct elections as expressed by reformist trade \nunion leaders. \n \nII. The Case for Direct Democratic Elections (2,221 words) \n \nSupport for direct elections has come from what we call the reform-wing of the \nACFTU associated with leaders such as Hao Wen Cai, with backing and support from \nsympathetic Party leaders, intellectuals based in labour research institutes such as \nChina Industrial Relations College and centres based at Beijing Normal University \nand People\u2019s University, and journalists. A key protagonist of direct elections has \nbeen the chair of the ACFTU Department for the Construction of Grassroots \nOrganisations, Hao Wen Cai. Hao has maintained that the experiments with direct \nelections in foreign-invested enterprises are in line with ACFTU law and constitution, \nwith the democratisation and `mass-isation\u2019 of China, and that direct elections are the \nfuture path for trade union elections in China (Xinhua 2003a). Other key supporters of \ndirect elections are some provincial-level trade unions leaders, particularly in coastal \nprovinces such as Guangdong, Zhejiang and Shandong. Indeed, as a senior official in \nthe ACFTU observed, `it is the localities that are pushing the elections\u2019xiv rather than \nthe centre.   \n \nReformers within the ACFTU have been acutely aware of the gap between the \nchanges at the macro-level and the capacity of grassroots trade union cadres to \nrespond to the grievances of workers. Rather than changing this just through political \nexhortation and rhetoric, the reformers are seeking to alter the incentive structure that \noperates at grassroots level, where cadres have to deal directly with workers\u2019 \ngrievances.  By introducing direct elections they intend to generate a new layer of \ngrassroots trade unions cadres that is closer to workers, more passionate about \nworkers\u2019 rights and more accountable. Moreover, by widening the pool of candidates \nthere is more scope for competent and popular leaders to be elected, an argument used \nalso in support of village elections. In this way they hope to overcome the enduring \nproblem of workers\u2019 alienation from the union as a result of bureaucratisation and \nParty dominance.  A senior official in the ACFTU illustrated these points to us with \nreference to an American enterprise, Haofu Taigu Yuhang Company in Xiamen, \nwhere the workers voted out of office the unpopular incumbent trade union chair. \n \nProvincial trade union leaders we interviewed suggested that having to make a speech \nbefore a worker\u2019s assembly about their actions and intentions, and to respond to \nspontaneous questions from workers, makes candidates more aware of and \naccountable to workers\u2019 interests. As the vice-head of province A trade union stated:  \n `He [the elected candidate] thinks \u201cI\u2019ve been elected by everyone\u201d and often \nhe made promises in his election speech about what he would do for everyone. If he \ncan\u2019t keep his promises, will people vote for him again? He feels responsible towards \nhis members, has quite a strong sense of responsibility to people below. If it\u2019s the \nconverse, as in our former system, he would be responsible upwards and so his \nattitude towards the trade union, to trade union work, to trade union organising, all \nwould be different. In this way [direct elections], the trust of employees in the trade \nunion and the cohesiveness are quite strong\u2019xv.  According to a senior official in the \nACFTU, direct elections are already having an effect on the behaviour of trade union \ncadres,  `These chairs have changed from being in the past `[they [i.e. higher-level \nauthorities]] want me to do\u2019 to `I want to do\u2019 (zhe xie zhuximen, you Hao qu de \u201cyao \nwo gan\u201d zhanbian wei \u201cwo yao gan\u201d), thus redressing the balance of interests \ntowards workers. Of course such comments reflect the optimism of reformers who are \nkeen to see change in the ACFTU. How much has actually changed from the point of \nworkers is another story that requires rigorous and systematic investigation\nxvi\n. \nNevertheless a vital ingredient in pushing reform forwards is the visionary leadership \nthat can persuasively argue and strategise for change.  \n \nA second motive given by trade union leaders for direct elections relates to expanding \nthe trade union base in the private sector. Apart from the difficulties of establishing a \ntrade union in a private company, where owners have been notoriously reluctant to \nallow unionisation, trade unionists face the added problem of having to mobilise a \npredominantly rural, migrant workforce that knows little about the role of a trade \nunion. Advocates of direct elections thus maintain that through the preparatory work \nfor direct elections the ACFTU can raise awareness amongst migrant workers about \nthe role of a trade union. Direct elections, too, can, they argue, increase workers\u2019 \nconsciousness of being both a trade union member and part of the working class and \nso dilute the influence of a place-based identity that hinders the development of class \nconsciousness.   \n \nThird, reformers in the ACFTU hope that grassroots elections will stabilise labour \nrelations and reduce spontaneous unrest\nxvii\n.   As several respondents pointed out, \nworkers are more likely to heed leaders that they respect and have directly elected \nthan distant leaders appointed from above\nxviii\n. Whilst there is a risk, as with village \nelections, that popular leaders may be overzealous in representing their \nconstituencies\u2019 interests, they also make it easier for higher-level authorities to exert \ncontrol downwards. For the ACFTU direct elections offer a way of strengthening the \nlinks between the higher and lower levels of the organisation, extending its base to the \nprivate sector, and enhancing the motivation of grassroots cadres through greater \naccountability to workers.  \n \nFourth, trade union reformers at national and local levels justify direct elections of \ntrade union cadres as part of a broader trend towards `democratisation\u2019 and \n`massisation\u2019 [need to find another word. This is not an English word] (qunzhonghua) \nof state and quasi-state structures in China. The idea of trade union elections forms \npart of a more general process of reform and modernisation that includes village \nelections, community elections, experimentation with elections for village Party \nbranches and township leaders, and public hearings. All these are aimed at enhancing \nthe downward accountability and legitimacy of Party-state institutions through \nextended participation, and when convenient, at bolstering China\u2019s diplomatic \narmoury to counter external criticism of its democratic credentials.  Local trade \nunionists can tactically appropriate this argument to justify pushing local experiments \nin direct elections.  \n \nFinally, the reform wing of the ACFTU sees direct elections as a way of gaining more \nindependence for the union so that it can deal more effectively with workers\u2019 \ngrievances and interests. As the vice-head of a provincial trade union remarked, \n`several people in the trade union say \u201cthe trade union keeps cool under the big tree\u201d\u2019, \nthat is, it enjoys the protection of the Party and is thus not an independent organisation. \nIf the trade union is to work more independently, then the reforms have to begin from \nbelow and as the vice-head suggested, \u201cwe need to find a balance between the Party \nand the trade union\u201dxix. Direct trade union elections are therefore one way of \npromoting a more independent role for the trade union.  \n \nGiven the sensitivities around trade union reform, particularly in relation to Party \nleadership, reformers have set about quietly introducing direct elections. Drawing on \nthe experiences of Shekou Special Economic Zone\nxx\n, which first experimented with \ndirect elections in 1986, and later pilots, the ACFTU drew up a document entitled \n`Basic Thoughts on Trade Union Reform (gonghui gaige de jiben shexiang) that was \nissued at the Sixth Meeting of the 10\nth\n Executive Session of the ACFTU on 9\nth\n \nOctober 1988 (Wang 2003). Clause 43, chapter 7 of this document proposed that TU \nleaders at all levels should be democratically elected and that members of grassroots \ntrades unions members with appropriate conditions could directly elect their leaders. \nHowever due to the turbulent events of 1989 and the accusation of ACFTU \ninvolvement in the protests, this document was not implemented.  The reformers had \nto wait until the political context eased up before they could push forward with \nelectoral reforms.  \n \nFollowing Deng Xiaoping\u2019s southern tour in 1992 and the political signal this gave of \nwaning conservative influence, the reformers seized the opportunity to issue the \n`Implementing regulations for TU Grassroots Organisations Election Work\u2019. Five \nyears later the ACFTU issued `Opinions on some core issues in advancing trade union \nreform and construction\u2019, in which Clause 15 again stated that in small and medium \nenterprises, the trade union chair, vice-chair and committee should be directly elected \nthrough the workers\u2019 or representative assembly.  These Opinions encouraged more \nlocal trade unions to experiment with direct elections and throughout the 1990s direct \nelections gradually spread to other provinces such as Zhejiang, Shandong and Fujian \n(Xinhua 2003b).   \n \nSo far reformers within the central ACFTU and provincial leaderships have allowed \ngrassroots trades unions to quietly get on with elections, trying out different methods. \nIn Zhejiang province, for example, a senior trade union cadre explained how in their \nlocal document on electoral methods, they state that only \u201csea elections\u201d, as in the \nvillage elections, are genuine, direct elections, whilst the 1992 ACFTU document on \nmethods states that direct elections includes trade union committee members electing \ntheir chair\nxxi\n. In this way local leaders have pushed ahead of the central trade union, \nusing the model of village elections, to `democratise\u2019 elections at grassroots level. \nHowever, provincial leaders have astutely avoided giving too much publicity to the \ndifferent experiments, judging that this would only draw the attention of unwanted \neyes in the central ACFTU and potential disapproval, thereby jeopardising these \nefforts\nxxii\n.   \n \nHowever despite the efforts of reform-minded trade union leaders to promote direct \nelections, they have not spread with the alacrity of village elections, nor created a \nvocal bottom-up demand from workers to extend these elections to their enterprises in \nthe way that villagers have demanded the right to choose their leaders or urban-\ndwellers have demanded to elect their leaders. Nor have they drawn much attention \ninternationally. Whilst the advocates of village elections skilfully played the \ninternational card to their advantage, letting foreign journalists and scholars report on \nthe bottom-up democratisation of China, trade union reformers have been much more \ncautious in their approach. In the next section we look more closely at the reasons for \nthe different trajectory of direct trade union elections in China.  \n \nIII Obstacles to Direct Democratic Elections \n \nPolitical, institutional and structural factors have contributed to the snail-pace spread \nof the more democratic direct elections for grassroots trade union leaders. Though \nsome press reports and interviewees claim that direct elections have been widely \ncarried out, with some reports putting the figure in Guangdong province in 2003 \nalready at one third\nxxiii\n, without independent investigation this is hard to verify, \nespecially given the varied methods used as described by our informants. Resistance \nto the reforms from within the ACFTU was already surfacing in the run-up to the 14\nth\n \nACFTU Congress in 2002 when, it is rumoured, that the Congress Vice-Chair, Hao \nWen Cai, was criticised for promoting direct elections\nxxiv\n. The issue of democratic \ndirect elections generated considerable debate at this Congress and divisions within \nthe central leadership and lower levels continue to influence the trajectory of the \nelections. Hao referred at the Congress to the drafting of a document on direct \nelections, namely, `Regulations on Direct Elections of Grassroots Trade Union \nChairs\u2019. Stating that the ACFTU constitution allowed workers to directly elect their \ntrade union leaders, Hao reported that these new regulations would furnish the \nnecessary detailed guidelines on basic procedures, requirements for candidates and \nother matters\nxxv\n. Yet, as of spring 2007, these regulations are still being drafted. \n \nOpponents and more cautious reformers such as Su Weiqing, ACFTU head, have \nmustered three key and related arguments to attack the idea of direct democratic \nelections. First, they have charged that foreign companies have deliberately tried to \npromote direct elections in their factories so as to destabilise China. In an interview in \nJuly 2003 Su criticised foreign companies for requiring direct elections of trade union \nleaders as a condition for receiving their orders or following audits of labour rights \nand accused them of interfering in China\u2019s internal affairs (Wang 2003). This, he \nsuggested, was not in accordance with the Trade Union Law or Constitution.  His \nunderlying concern was that foreign forces were seeking to establish a `second\u2019 trade \nunion that would be independent of the CCP and challenge the authority of the \nACFTU. This anxiety needs to be interpreted within a broader context where the \nChinese leadership was closely following the Colour Revolutions in Georgia, \nKyrgyzstan and Ukraine. No doubt this must have brought back memories of the rise \nof Solidarity in Poland. Putin\u2019s declarations that Western governments had had a hand \nin promoting these revolutions and his subsequent clampdown on NGOs in Russia \nresonated with the Chinese leadership, which in turn has instigated investigations of \nforeign foundations and NGOs in China. The idea that foreigners might be involved in \norganising workers was therefore deeply worrying for the Party. \n \nThe second argument used by opponents of direct elections is economic. It is \nsuggested that by drawing attention to poor labour standards and the absence of free \ntrade unions in China, foreign companies are surreptitiously seeking to raise labour \ncosts and thereby undermine China\u2019s competitiveness. The discourse of corporate \nsocial responsibility and along with that, direct elections in supplier factories to \nforeign companies are for some trade unionists and Party leaders merely a device to \nprotect Western markets\nxxvi\n.  \n \nThe third issue in the armoury of opponents and more cautious reformers revolves \naround political stability. Here the argument runs that direct elections will produce \nweak, incompetent or politically risky leaders, who will be unable or unwilling to \nmoderate workers\u2019 demands and, most importantly, will be beyond Party control. Or, \nit is argued, workers will tend to elect leaders who belong to the same clan or native-\nplace, which will only fuel clan and place-based tensions within factories and \nundermine the cohesion of the trade union.   \n \nGiven that the more radical reformers have not been able to institutionalise the \nelections through the promulgation of regulations for the elections, a compromise \nposition has been reached. For the moment the ACFTU has taken an intermediate \nposition towards direct elections, suggesting that they are appropriate in small and \nmedium-sized enterprises, state enterprises and public units, but less appropriate in \nprivate or foreign-invested enterprises\nxxvii. However the phrase `less appropriate\u2019 does \nnot mean that they are prohibited, suggesting that the reformers have managed to keep \nopen the possibilities for experimentation at the local level. Furthermore, Su Weiqing \nand other leaders in the ACFTU have kept open the space for this reform by claiming \nownership of the idea of direct elections and challenging the notion seemingly \nconveyed in the media that direct elections are the brainchild of foreign \ncompanies\nxxviii\n. \n \nLeaders such as Su Weiqing are more cautious than some lower level officials, not \ncompletely opposing the idea but seeking to restrain those more radical reformers who \nwant to see faster and more widespread implementation. These cautious reformers \nthus prefer a path of gradually pushing forward the elections through a process of \npreliminary investigations, summarising the results, identifying models and then \nguiding the localities to implement elections in a standard way, starting out with small \nand medium sized enterprises\nxxix. This is reflected in Su\u2019s 2003 interview where he \nstates that candidates should meet certain conditions, such as the six requirements laid \ndown in the constitution of the ACFTU\nxxx\n, thereby reminding more radical reformers \nin the union of the principle of Party leadership (Wang 2003). To cap this, he goes on \nto say that the ultimate goal is to improve the intermediary, bridging role of the TU \nbetween workers and the Party, rather than to establish the autonomy of the TU from \nthe Party per se\nxxxi\n.  \n \nThe effects of these national-level tensions around the direct elections level have \nbecome manifest in the unease of some national trade union leaders when media \ncoverage is given to the success of direct elections in the provinces\nxxxii\n. Furthermore \nsome local level trade union leaders have become cautious about introducing direct \nelections when the process is not legitimated through directives from above. For some \nreformers, the lack of authoritative institutionalisation of direct elections and the slow \npace in producing detailed documentation has led to frustration with the process.\nxxxiii\n. \nFor others, however, the absence of any detailed document from the central level on \nhow to organise elections, has provided an opening to take the lead in issuing detailed \nregulations on electoral procedures and pushing ahead with direct elections, albeit \nwith some caution\nxxxiv\n. Indeed it is noteworthy that in Guangdong province the \nprovincial trade union has stipulated that direct elections can be promoted first in \nforeign-invested enterprises, and especially in TNCs, thus contradicting the central \nrecommendations. \n \nAs a result the methods for selecting candidates\nxxxv\n, electoral procedures, and \ncandidate requirements vary considerably across places and enterprises, a \nphenomenon that also characterised village elections, particularly in the first decade.  \nThis has led to considerable confusion amongst trade union officials as to what can be \ngenuinely called a `democratic direct election\u2019. Two contrasting situations in a \nclothing foreign-invested enterprise and a printing factory in town H as recounted by \nthe respective enterprise trade unionists illustrate this well. \n \nThe clothing factory has a workforce of approximately 2,500, of whom 1,000 are \ntrade union members\nxxxvi\n. It is important to provide more information on this (and the \nother) factory and the entire election procedure. This should be the core of the paper, \nbut there is very little meat in it. For instance, at least state the ownership of the \nfactory. This has big repercussions on the election. Who did the nomination? Just the \nworkers? In the other factory looks like the nomination process was totally controlled. \nThe factory is divided into five `electoral wards\u2019, based on several workshops and \nembracing from as 56 to over 500 workers in each. Each electoral ward nominates \ncandidates to be member representatives and has to vote in 24 representatives per \nward. You mean even a ward of 56 people could nominate 24 representatives? Then it \nwas not proportional representation. In the electoral ward of the vice-trade union chair, \nWho was the vice chair? Did he\/she self-nominate? Or nomited by the workers? Or by \nmanagement? Or by upper level trade union? there were over 500 workers and around \n40 people reportedly put themselves forward as candidates. These candidates gave \nspeeches and responded to questions. The 120 member representatives then elected 20 \ntrade union committee members. Was the election by secret ballot? Was the vote \ncounting transparent? The newly elected trade union committee in turn voted for the \nchair and vice-chair from a list of self-appointed candidates from the committee. Was \nthis second section transparent?  In all elections the persons with the majority of votes, \nwhether or not these constituted more than half of all votes\nxxxvii\n, reportedly wins the \nelections.  \n \nThe situation in the printing factory, ownership? which started elections in 1996, , \nSame questions for the first factory apply to this one. differs in that the three \ncandidates for trade union chair were all managers, rather than workers, and \nnominated by the enterprise management rather than by the workers. All three were \nrequired to make speeches and drew lots to decide who would speak first. The trade \nunion members cast their votes in public using voting slips, leaving room for others to \nsee how individuals were voting. Not sure what it means. What are voting slips? Aare \nnot these secret ballot? The elected trade union chair then handpicked the trade union \ncommittee, appointing two of his former rivals\nxxxviii\n.  According to the town trade \nunion chair What did the town trade union do when this factory had its election? \nShouldn\u2019t it have monitored the election? The town trade union chair sounds as if \nhe\/she had nothing to do with it. As if it is not his business. That\u2019s a problem isn\u2019t it? , \nthe processes in this factory were `not as democratic as elsewhere\u2019, where direct \nelections were held for the trade union representatives, then trade union committee, \nand then indirectly for the trade union chair\nxxxix\n. In practice, therefore, there is \nconsiderable elasticity in the meanings given to direct elections, ranging from free \nnomination of candidates by workers at one end, as in the clothing factory, to \nnomination of candidates by enterprise managers or higher-trade union authorities, as \nin the printing factory. Those officials with a clearer perspective on what constitutes a \ngenuine election underline the importance of `sea elections\u2019, as used in village \nelections, as a key distinguishing feature of a democratic direct election.  \n \nApart from these political factors there are also institutional reasons for the slow and \nuneven spread of direct, democratic elections. First, when the economic reformers led \nby Deng Xiaoping set about reinvigorating the economy, they also took steps to \nrevitalise the ACFTU so as to reassert control over workers for production. As part of \nthis process, Document No. 24 was issued in 1981. This gave enterprise trade union \nchairs the same treatment in terms of salary, benefits (car, bigger flat etc) and status as \na vice-Party secretary or vice-director in the enterprise. This brought grassroots trade \nunion cadres in state-owned enterprises into the management scope of the higher level \nParty committee, on the one hand raising their status but on the other hand assuring \nParty control over them.  \n \nDirect elections open up the possibility for workers to become trade union chairs and \nso threaten trade union vested interests in state enterprises. As a worker is not a cadre, \nand thus cannot fall under the management of the higher level Party committee, \nintroducing direct elections would seriously undermine this system. By removing the \nbenefits enjoyed by state-owned enterprise trade union chairs, there would be no \nincentive for anyone to take up this position. As a senior provincial trade union \nofficial explained, enterprise Party committees and trade union chairs in state-owned \nenterprises have a vested interest in maintaining this status quo and resisting any \nattempts to introduce genuine elections\nxl\n. For this reason it had been much easier to \npress ahead with direct elections in say Guangdong or Zhejiang provinces, where \nforeign-invested enterprises predominate, than in provinces where state enterprises \nwere more numerous. Of course the issue is not just about the status of workers versus \ncadres, as in the early 1950s the ACFTU recruited many workers into leadership \npositions (Lee 1986: 44-46). Though it is not often openly articulated, the issue \nrevolves as much around the idea of a rural, migrant worker becoming an urban cadre. \n \nWhere direct elections have taken place, the dilemma of whether a worker can \nbecome a cadre has been handled in different ways. In some foreign enterprises, \nnewly directly elected trade union chairs are given the status of cadres. For example, \nin a printing factory in town H, the elected trade union chair, a former migrant worker, \nenjoyed the salary and benefits of a deputy director\nxli\n. Similarly in a foreign-invested \nclothing factory, the elected vice-chair of the trade union was placed on the salary \nscale of a cadre, though he was previously a migrant worker from Hubei province\nxlii\n.  \nHowever some trade union officials are reluctant for workers to assume positions of \ntrade union cadres. For example, the vice-head of the province A Bureau for the \nConstruction of Grassroots Organisations explained that in recently established trade \nunions, they let the enterprise director nominate candidates and recommended them to \nchoose a middle-level cadre rather than a worker\nxliii\n. In his view workers in labour-\nintensive industries such as clothing lacked democratic and working-class \nconsciousness and therefore were not qualified to be trade union cadres. His \nunderlying concern was probably that leaders elected by workers would be less \nmalleable than those nominated by the Party.  \n \nThe second institutional factor affecting the pace of reform relates to the relatively \nclosed and conservative nature of the ACFTU. Compared to the ACWF national and \nprovincial cadres in the ACFTU have had far less exposure to labour organising \ninternationally.  The 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women was a watershed for \nthe ACWF, providing national and provincial cadres with opportunities to travel and \nexchange with women activists and learn about different issues, ways of organising \nand framing concepts. The reluctance of the international trade union movement to \nengage with the ACFTU has contributed to this persisting conservatism. Why this \nmatters is that ACFTU leaders have little experience or vision of what an effective, \ngrassroots trade union  cadre would look like. As stated earlier, the ACFTU has not \nhad to mobilise workers or struggle to set up trade unions. When faced with these \ntasks in the reform period, it remains poorly equipped to do this. Though the idea of \ndirectly electing workers is a step in the direction of a more responsive trade union, \nthe advocates of this are less clear about how the grassroots cadre should actually \noperate once elected. Indeed the radical potential of the idea becomes undermined \nwhen higher-levels of the trade union then set about training the newly elected cadres \nin the functions of the ACFTU, reining them in and disciplining them to conform to a \ncertain model of trade union activism.  \n \nInterviews with trade union leaders in enterprises that are noted by the local trade \nunions to be models for direct elections suggest that elected trade union leaders soon \nlearn to prioritise production over workers\u2019 interests. For example, in a discussion \nwith a trade union chair and vice-chair in a foreign-invested clothing factory [Is this \none of the factories described above?] , it was striking that they did not consider their \nrole in persuading workers to work excessive overtime as problematic\nxliv\n. Similarly \ntheir focus on welfare issues, such as the quality of food, dormitory conditions and \nentertainment rather than on hours of work or wages suggest the ongoing reproduction \nof the trade union as usual. In a printing factory in town H [which printing factory? \nOne of those described above?] , the trade union chair explained how they organised \nactivities for workers during the slack season so that they would not seek employment \nelsewhere, thus again facilitating production goals. Similarly the elected chair of the \nclothing factory in town H explained the role of the union in cultivating loyalty and \nidentity amongst migrant workers. In his words ` of course, the future trade union \nneeds to change the attitude of workers, \u2026that is, change a worker from someone \nwho is outside of society to someone who is an enterprise person, for example, love \ntheir job, love their factory\u2026\u2019xlv.  \n \nThis is further complicated by the third institutional factor, namely, the anomaly in \ntrade union membership conditions, whereby from the 1950s onwards any salaried, \npermanent staff in the enterprise, be they manual or mental workers, could become \ntrade union members (Lee 1986: 48, 115)\nxlvi\n. This has led to the paradoxical situation \nin which managers stand for election and become elected as trade union chairs, as \ndescribed in the printing factory earlier. For example, in a factory in province B the \nexisting directly elected trade union chair was a relative of the factory owner. The \nowner agreed to have sea elections for the chair position and the workers elected the \nexisting trade union chair. As she was also a salaried staff member of the factory, the \nhigher-level trade union could not object to her nomination. Furthermore as this was \nan export company with above average salary levels and working conditions, the \nunion was loathe to intervene. Its response was to note this but not use this factory as \na model for emulation. Similarly, in one enterprise in town K in province B the \ngeneral manager won the election for trade union chair. The trade union initially \ncancelled these results. However, the higher level trade union overruled this, arguing \nthat the person with the most votes, whether worker or manager, should win \n(Nanfangdu Shibao, 2003). Interviews with other trade union cadres also revealed \nsimilar anomalies, which reflect the lack of class analysis within the ACFTU and the \nunwillingness of trade union cadres to confront both more powerful higher levels in \nthe union and factory owners.  \n \nFinally the progress of the direct elections has been hamstrung by the structural \nrelations between the Party, ACFTU and business at the local level. Party leaders, \ntrade union leaders and enterprise owners have colluded to ensure that local \ndevelopment is prioritised over workers\u2019 interests. Local governments are keen to \nattract foreign investors, offering numerous policy concessions and the promise of a \ncheap, compliant workforce. If the local trade union were to prioritise too much the \ninterests of workers, it would be simultaneously failing in its tasks of promoting \nproduction, economic growth and ultimately Party interests. As the head of the \nGrassroots Work Section of province B trade union pointed out:  \n\u201cYou can\u2019t focus only on workers\u2026it doesn\u2019t benefit the enterprise as whole. \nIf you mobilise the workers against the boss, then the enterprise may go bankrupt. \nYou should promote the interests of capital and you can protect the basic interests of \nworkers\u2026\u201d.xlvii  It is this dualist dilemma of balancing the oft contradictory goals of \nproduction with protecting workers\u2019 interests coupled with the trade union\u2019s weak \nposition vis-\u00e0-vis capital that not only underpins in part the hesitant approach of the \ncentral ACFTU to promoting direct elections in foreign enterprises but also holds \nback some trade union officials from advocating more enthusiastically for the \nestablishment of trade unions and direct elections in foreign enterprises.  \n \nThis prioritisation of production goals is reflected in the regulations of province A \ntrade union, which specify four situations where it will not permit direct elections. \nThese are first, where a TU is newly established; second, where relations in an \nenterprise are tense; third, where workers from one clan or place of origin dominate; \nand finally, in small, family businesses\nxlviii\n. Clearly these specifications suggest a \nhighly risk-averse and contradictory strategy. If relations in an enterprise are tense, \nthen having a popular trade union leader who enjoys legitimacy amongst workers \nshould be preferable to having a vacuum that opens up the path to spontaneous worker \naction. Underlying this is a deep fear of losing control, both amongst higher-level \ntrade union authorities over the grassroots and of the Party over the trade union. In the \nwords of a Guangdong trade union official, if a young migrant worker becomes \nelected, \u201ccan you control them? You can\u2019t control them at all. The higher-level trade \nunion has no way [of controlling them]\u201dxlix.  \n Given that there is no compulsion on local trade unions anywhere in China to hold \ndirect elections for grassroots trade union cadres, more conservative trade union \nofficials at the provincial or lower levels can sit back and wait for demand to trickle \nup rather than actively promote the idea. For example, the vice-head of the Bureau for \nthe Construction of Grassroots Organisations in province A trade union explained \nhow they responded to requests from enterprises for a change in trade union \nleadership and left it up to the enterprise as to whether or not they want to hold direct \nelections and what methods they use rather than setting out proactively to promote \ndemocratic direct elections\nl\n. Having direct elections becomes thus not a right of \nworkers but a `gift\u2019 from the enterprise owner and the higher-level trade union. This \nmore passive approach reflects the continued subordination of the trade union to both \nthe Party and now to capital. \n \nPolitical, institutional and structural factors have thus combined to slow down and \nconfine the introduction of direct elections to situations that are considered relatively \nsafe. Trade union officials navigate a tricky course between the Syclla of Party \ndominance and the Charybdis of the growing power of private capital. This course is \nmuch more treacherous than in the pre-reform days, when state-owned production \nprevailed, for private entrepreneurs can more easily dismiss any overzealous trade \nunion officials.  \n  \nCONCLUSION \n \nDirect elections have the potential to revitalise the trade union structure from the \nbottom-up by making grassroots trade union cadres more accountable and responsive \nto workers\u2019 interests. With pressure on them to take up the grievances of workers \ngrassroots trade union cadres, who would require workers\u2019 support to gain re-election, \nshould in theory prioritise workers\u2019 needs and so tilt the balance of interests away \nfrom the Party. With grassroots trade union cadres more responsive to workers, their \nactivities should go beyond welfarism to include negotiation, contestation and \nmobilisation around workers\u2019 claims. In this way the union would move away from \nbeing a state towards a societal corporatist institution. This is at least what the \nreformist elements in the ACFTU hope for.  \n \nIn practice, however, we have seen that the idea of direct elections has met resistance \nwithin the ACFTU itself, from the Party which insists on leadership over the mass \norganisations, and from foreign investors, who, if they accept any trade union \nestablishment at all, prefer the status quo to a trade union engaged actively on behalf \nof workers. It has not been possible for the reformers within the ACFTU to \ninstitutionalise direct elections, leading to considerable variation in electoral practices \nand confusion around what constitutes a genuine democratic election. Even where \nelections have been carried out using the democratic `sea elections\u2019 method, our \nresearch suggests that new union cadres are soon incorporated into existing trade \nunion structures and working style.  \n \nThe path of the trade union direct elections has thus taken a very different course to \nvillage elections, which have been institutionalised and generalised across the country. \nOn the one hand this reflects the lack of a coherent and cohesive group of visionary \nreformers at different levels with strong links to sympathetic Party leaders and their \nfailure to make the case persuasively; on the other hand it underlines the much greater \nsensitivity pertaining to labour issues and trade union reform which puts the Party \ndoubly on its guard. Any significant move forwards with direct elections is only likely \nto happen when there is a shift in the political context, either because of regime crisis \nor because of political liberalisation. In the meantime it is likely that conservative \nunion officials, who heed more the interests of the Party and factory owners than \nworkers, will continue to resist the implementation of elections or manipulate them so \nas to ensure the election of safe candidates.

I accept sole responsibility for the views expressed in this paper.   \nii\n For example, a senior official ACFTU informed us of two other models: in one, trade union members \nnominate and select a committee, whose members then are candidates for chair and vice-chair; in \nanother, individual members and\/or organisations nominate candidates for various positions (interview \nA2 30.03.2004).  \niii\n Clearly  the simplistic model of Western trade unions as independent, adversarial and evolving out of \ngrassroots activism cannot do justice to the gamut of trade union forms that exist. For a detailed \ndiscussion of differences between communist and capitalist trade unionism see Littler and Palmer \n(1986:253-271). \niv\n As Lee (1986: 159) comments, `Chinese unions have little of no \u201csub-system autonomy\u201d. Chinese  \nunion leaders make no pretense about this\u2026Chinese unions are essentially an arm of the executive to \nmobilise the resources of society\u201d. \nv\n Some of these changes include re-structuring the organisation, re-skilling trade union leaders to \nengage in collective bargaining, negotiate contracts, provide legal advice and mediate disputes, and \nparticipating in legislative processes. \nvi\n By the mid-1980s, for example, the State Council had issued an order permitting trade unions to \nparticipate in meetings of all administrative organs wherever workers\u2019 interests were touched upon \n(Chan 1993:53). \nvii\n For further details of the three crises in the ACFTU\u2019s pre-reform history see Harper 1969 and White, \nHowell and Shang 1996: 41-42. \nviii\n For a detailed analysis of the Party\u2019s response to events in Poland during the 1980s and the \nimplications of these for trade union and labour policies see Wilson (1990a, b). \nix\n Pravda and Ruble (1986:3) describe classic dualism in terms of two distinct functions: the union\u2019s \nrole in mobilising production and the union\u2019s role of protecting members\u2019 rights and interests. \nx\n Schmitter (1979: 105) distinguishes state from societal corporatism. He associates societal \ncorporatism with post-liberal, advanced capitalist, democratic welfare states and state corporatism with \npolitical systems that are anti-liberal and authoritarian, where elections are non-existent, only one party \nprevails, with an exclusive ideology.  \nxi\n Ni Zhifu commented: \u201cOur trade union is more like a \u201cgovernment-run organisation\u201d, which has \nseldom played an independent role in organising activities\u2026, since it has long been affected and \nfettered by the party\u2019s \u201ccentralised leadership\u201d, an administrative structure characterised by \novercentralisation of power, and undue emphasis on keeping trade union operations in line with social \ninterests\u201d (quoted in Wilson, 1990b: 55). \nxii\n In the early 1950s the ACFTU did have to mobilise workers into unions, the priority being to control \nworkers for reinvigorating production rather than defending their rights (Lee 1986:41-44) \n                                                                                                                                           \nxiii\n As a trade union chair from the North East of China lamented at a workshop on the WTO, labour \nrelations and trade unions held in Beijing in October 2002, \u201cThe TU is like a government department. \nIt is very administrative...The TU is a from top to bottom system\u2026\u201d \nxiv\n Interview, A1, 29.03.2004, senior official, ACFTU. \nxv\n Interview, C01, 19.05.2004. Vice-Chair of southern provincial Trade Union. \nxvi\n As far as I am aware, no such independent, rigorous surveys are available and given the sensitivity \nof these issues in China, we were not able to conduct any survey of workers\u2019 attitudes towards direct \nelections. \nxvii\n  Interview, A2, 30.03.2004, senior official, ACFTU. \nxviii\n For example, interviews B07 21.04.04; A2  30.03.2004,  Xinhua 2003a;  \nxix\n Interview, C01, 19.05.2004, Vice-Chair of southern provincial Trade Union. \nxx\n Direct elections in Shekou were institutionalised locally through the promulgation of the `Shekou \nIndustrial Zone Recruitment Bureau\u2019s Election Methods for Grassroots Trades Unions\u2019 in \n1991(Nanfangdu Shibao 2003).  \nxxi\n Interview, B03, Head of Grassroots Work Section of provincial trade union. \nxxii\n As a senior official in the provincial trade union pointed out, `we didn\u2019t make this issue public \nbecause it involves many issues. It\u2019s very difficult to explain it theoretically or however. I\u2019ve never \nwritten an article or anything on this. If you do this, the ACFTU can say that this is not correct, that is \nnot correct\u2019 (Interview, C01, Vice-Chair of southern provincial Trade Union,19.05.2004). Similarly the \nhead of the trade union in town H expressed his strong desire to keep a low profile about the work on \ndirect elections, not only because of potential criticism from higher levels of the ACFTU but also \nbecause direct elections might provide an entry point for `hostile forces infiltrating China\u2019.  Indeed the \ntown Party secretary had given the go-ahead to the elections but emphasised that he did not want the \ntown to be `the first in the country or province\u2019, that is, to catch the eyes of the higher level authorities \n(Interview, C09, Chair of Trade Union, Clothing Factory, Town H ,24.05.2004). \nxxiii\n For example, see Nanfangwang, Nanfangdu Shibao, `Zhixuan bu shi zuo xiu, Guangdong 1\/3 qiye \njiceng gonghui zhixuan chansheng\u2019,  09.07.2003  \nxxiv\n Interview, A1, 29.03.2004. senior trade union cadre, ACFTU. \nxxv\n Interview, A1, 29.03.2004. senior trade union cadre, ACFTU. \nxxvi\n During a workshop on the WTO, labour relations and trade unions held in Beijing in October 2002 \nand organised by the China Industrial Relations College, IDS and GBCC, there was heated discussion \namongst trade union representatives and scholars as to whether international labour standards were \nabout the protection of Western markets or a genuine concern for workers\u2019 interests.  \nxxvii\n See Su Wei Qing\u2019s July 2003 interview in Wang 2003. \nxxviii\n In his interview with Worker Daily reporter Wang Jiao Yin, Su Wei Qing states that `\u2026jiben tan \nbu shang ye bu keneng shi juezhuyu waili liang de tuidong cai shi xiande\u2019 (basically we cannot say that \nand it is not possible that this [trade union direct elections] was only realised after promotion by \nexternal forces) (Wang, 2003).  \nxxix\n See interview, A1, 29.03.2004, senior trade union cadre, ACFTU, on interpretation of Su Weiqing\u2019s \nviews. \nxxx\n Note in particular point 2 which states \u201c implement the basic line, strategy and policies of the Party, \nobey state law, regulations\u201d and the last point \u201cdemocratic work style, consciously receive workers\u2019 \nand the masses\u2019 criticism and supervision\u201d.  \nxxxi\n For example, Su Weiqing states in his interview with Wang Jiaoyin, `\u2026conger shi gonghui geng \nhao de fahui dang lianxi zhigong qunzhong de qiaoliang niudai zuyong\u2019 (thus it enables the trade union \nto perform the function of serving as a bridge linking the Party and workers) (Wang 2003).  \nxxxii\n For example when discussing this coverage in the interview, a senior leader in the ACFTU \ncommented that `there are many such reports. But the ACFTU leaders do not like to hear these\u2019. \n29.03.2004 \nxxxiii\n For example, a senior official in a relevant department of the ACFTU expressed his frustration  \nwith the slow process of authorisation which he  considered vital for promoting and extending direct \nelections, and linked this pace to the sensitivity of the issue, and hence the need for caution. Interview, \nA2, 30.03.2004. \nxxxiv\n As the vice-head of the Grassroots Organisation and Construction Section of a provincial trade \nunion explained, they were pushing ahead with direct elections but their approach was one of pragmatic \nbut innovative caution, not least because they had still not received any document from the central \nACFTU stipulating if, or how, direct elections should be carried out (Interview, C02, 19.05.2004).  \n                                                                                                                                           \nxxxv\n For example a trade union official we interviewed (C11 24.05.2004) summarised the following \nmethods used in the province: In some factories workers directly elect the trade union chair from \nmultiple candidates; in others, workers nominate the candidates and the Trade Union Committee, then \nelect the trade union chair and vice-chair; and in the majority, especially in newly formed trade unions, \nthe higher-level trade union and the enterprise director nominate candidates, which is a far cry from the \nmore democratic sea elections! \nxxxvi\n Interview, C11, 24.05.2004. Chair of Trade Union, Clothing Factory, Town H. \nxxxvii\n This point is made as in village elections, where the successful candidate has to get more than half \nof the votes to be elected.  \nxxxviii\n The trade union committee had three members, responsible respectively for sports, general living \nissues, culture and the women\u2019s committee, the last two tasks being carried out by the only female \nmember (Interview, C12, Chair of Trade Union chair of printing factory, town H). \nxxxix\n Interview, C09, 24.05.2005.

Similarly in an \nelectronics company in town S, the directly elected trade union chair explained in a matter of fact way \nthat extra overtime just had to be done (Interview, C12, Chair of Trade Union, Printing Factory, Town \nH, 25.05.2004).  \nxlv\n Interview, C12, Chair of Trade Union, Printing Factory, Town H, 24.05.2004. \nxlvi\n Temporary and contract workers were thus not allowed to join the trade union. As Lee (1986) \ndiscusses, Red Guards mobilised these workers to attack trade union cadres.  \nxlvii\n Interview, B03 22.04.2004. \nxlviii\n Interview, C01, 19.05.2004.
