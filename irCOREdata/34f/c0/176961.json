We aim to interview people with Paget's\ndisease, and their families, from the UK. Our research questions are:\n1. What do individuals with Paget's disease think would influence the involvement of their\nrelatives in a programme of genetic testing and preventative treatment?\n2. What do relatives of Paget's disease sufferers think would influence them in accepting an offer\nof a programme of genetic testing and preventative treatment?\nDiscussion: Our research will be informed by relevant psychological theory: primarily the Self-\nRegulation Model and the Theory of Planned Behaviour. The results of these interviews will inform\nthe development of a separate questionnaire-based study to explore these research questions in\ngreater detail.\nBackground\nThe need for this research\nOver recent years, advances in human molecular genetics\nhave resulted in the identification of polymorphisms and\nmutations in several genes that cause or predispose to dis-\neases such as cancer, neurodegenerative conditions and\ninborn errors of metabolism. For some of these condi-\ntions, such as Huntington's disease and muscular dystro-\nphy, it is possible to offer a genetic test that will give\ninformation on the probability of the disease occurring\nbut this is somewhat unattractive to patients without the\nprospect of an effective treatment. For other diseases, such\nas hypercholesterolaemia and haemochromatosis, identi-\nfication of genetic susceptibility can be used as a risk fac-\ntor to inform management strategies and treatment\ndecisions in a similar way to other clinical risk factors.\nThis application aims to test the feasibility of translating\ngenetic knowledge into practice by examining the accept-\nability of offering genetic testing, followed by therapeutic\nintervention, to people with Paget's disease of bone.\nPaget's disease of bone\nPaget's disease of bone (PDB) affects about 3% of individ-\nuals over the age of 55 years in the UK [1]. It is character-\nised by focal increases in bone turnover, affecting one or\nmore bones throughout the skeleton. The abnormal bone\nturnover disrupts normal bone architecture and causes\nbone pain, bone deformity, deafness, osteoarthritis, and\npathological fractures [2]. Genetic factors have long been\nrecognised to play an important role in Paget's disease [3-\n6] and recent studies by our own group and others indi-\ncate that between 40\u201350% of instances of familial Paget's\ndisease are caused by mutations affecting the ubiquitin-\nassociated (UBA) domain of the SQSTM1 gene [7-11].\nGenotype-phenotype analysis has shown that SQSTM1\nmutations are highly penetrant, such that between 90\u2013\n100% of individuals within families who carry mutations\nwill have developed the disease by the age of 65 years [7-\n11].\nIn view of this, it is timely to investigate the clinical poten-\ntial for a programme of genetic testing and preventative\ntreatment for patients who carry SQSTM1 mutations, in\nan effort to prevent or delay the development of Paget's\ndisease or its complications.\nProspects for preventing Paget's disease\nBisphosphonates such as Risedronate, Pamidronate and\nZoledronate have emerged as highly effective agents for\nreducing bone turnover and treating bone pain in patients\nwith Paget's disease [12]. Clinical studies have shown that\nthese drugs can restore elevated levels of bone turnover to\nnormal in a high proportion of cases, can improve the\nappearance of Pagetic lesions on isotope bone scans [13],\nand can restore bone architecture to normal, as assessed\nhistologically [14].\nThis raises the possibility that patients who carry SQSTM1\nmutations and who are at high risk of developing Paget's\ndisease could be offered prophylactic therapy, in an\nattempt to prevent the disease occurring, or to prevent\ncomplications developing. A particularly promising mode\nof treatment in this respect is Zoledronate, which is a\nhighly effective treatment for Paget's disease even in\nmicrogram doses [15], with inhibitory effects on bone\nturnover that can extend for at least 12 months after a sin-\ngle injection [16]. There is also evidence to suggest that\ntreatment with intravenous Pamidronate and oral Risedr-\nonate can suppress bone resorption in active Paget's dis-\nease for up to two years [17,18].\nWith the existence of effective treatment for Paget's dis-\nease that could prevent or delay the onset of the disease,\nwe need to explore the acceptability of genetic testing fol-\nlowed by preventative treatment in patients with Paget's\ndisease of bone.Page 2 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2006, 6:71 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/6\/71Possible factors that could affect acceptability of genetic \ntesting and preventative treatment\nEvidence from other areas of genetic testing suggests that\npatients may not wish to take genetic tests. For example,\nin Huntington's disease, prior to the development of a\ngenetic test, individuals at risk declared a much higher\nintention of taking a test than the actual numbers taking\nthe test when it became available [19]. Studies have\nshown that there is a widespread belief that genetic condi-\ntions are not treatable. Such beliefs might affect the\nacceptability of diagnosis and treatment of genetic condi-\ntions. However, the additional offer of effective preventa-\ntive treatment can make genetic testing more acceptable\n[20].\nBeliefs\nEvidence from other, non-genetic, conditions, for which\nthere are effective treatments, demonstrates that patients'\nbeliefs may affect the acceptability and uptake of treat-\nment. Two groups of beliefs (illness representations and\ntreatment representations) are most likely to be influen-\ntial.\nIllness representations\nIllness representations describe how people see their ill-\nness. This is most clearly outlined in the Self-regulation\nModel (SRM) [21]. The five key representations are:\n\u2022 identity (e.g. the 'label', identifying symptoms);\n\u2022 cause (e.g. stress, genetics);\n\u2022 consequences (e.g. activity limitations, loss of wages);\n\u2022 timeline (e.g. acute, fluctuating, progressing);\n\u2022 cure\/control (e.g. medication, diet, exercises).\nIn addition, the SRM identifies the emotional representation\n(e.g. frustrating, frightening) as a separate dimension of\nrepresentation. Based on this model, Weinman and col-\nleagues [22] have developed a measure, the Illness Percep-\ntions Questionnaire (IPQ), to assess these representations\nand have found that they are predictive of uptake and\nresponse to a wide variety of treatments, including the\nbone disease Rheumatoid Arthritis [23]. Clearly, such\nbeliefs may influence uptake of a new treatment offered to\nfamilies with Paget's disease, and Marteau has shown that\nbeliefs affect the decision to accept a genetic test [24].\nPaget's disease has a highly variable presentation: age at\nonset, severity of symptoms and impact on sufferer's lives;\nand individuals might vary in their response to an offer of\ntesting and treatment depending on the disease history\nwithin their family. Using the World Health Organisation\nInternational Classification of Functioning, Disability and\nHealth model of health components [25], one might\nexpect that all three components (impairment, activity\nlimitations, and participation restrictions) might affect\nbeliefs about the identity, consequences and timeline of\nthe condition.\nTreatment representations\nTreatment representations describe how people perceive\npotential treatments for their disease. There is considera-\nble evidence that patients' beliefs about treatment (e.g.\naccessibility, burden, perceived likelihood of success)\ninfluence uptake and adherence [26]. People offered a\nprogramme of genetic testing and treatment will develop\ntheir own treatment representations based on what is\noffered, but the beliefs rather than the objective pro-\ngramme of treatment, are likely to determine their willing-\nness to participate. The Theory Of Planned Behaviour\n(TPB) [26] (is a theoretical model, which predicts behav-\niours from people's beliefs about the consequences, social\npressures and perceived control over the behaviour,\nincluding uptake of treatment (Figure 1).\nThe nature of the treatment and treatment offer\nThe nature of the treatment, and the way in which the\ntreatment is offered, may affect acceptability. One needs\nto consider not only how to invite the affected individual\nto 'involve' their family, but also how to introduce the\nprogramme to invited family members. Hardeman and\ncolleagues [27] in the Pro-Active Programme, have devel-\noped an interview for families of people with Type 2 dia-\nbetes that incorporates the offer of the intervention for\noffspring. This interview was based on the interviews used\nto develop questionnaires for the Theory of Planned\nBehaviour (TPB) addressing beliefs about involving the\noffspring in the programme. It has proved very effective in\nrendering the programme acceptable [27].\nThe Theory of Planned Behaviour (Azjen, 1991)Figure 1\nThe Theory of Planned Behaviour (Azjen, 1991).\nAttitude\nSubjective\nNorm\nPerceived\nBehavioural\nControl\nBehaviourIntentionPage 3 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2006, 6:71 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/6\/71In addition, the treatment offered for Paget's disease could\nbe in tablet or infusion form, and could be administered\nin a range of environments. All of these factors may influ-\nence the acceptability of a programme of genetic testing\nand preventative treatment.\nDemographic and health characteristics\nDemographic and health characteristics may also influ-\nence the acceptability of treatment. For example, someone\nwho is older may think they are less at risk if they have\npassed the age of onset of Paget's disease in the affected\nperson; or they may think they are nearing the time when\nthe disease might affect them. Closeness to the affected\nperson may make them view the condition as more or less\nserious, and they may be influenced by how the affected\nperson copes with the illness. Furthermore, one might\nexpect there to be more agreement within members of one\nfamily than between families due to their shared exposure\nto the condition as well as their opportunity to discuss\nand influence each other.\nScientific value of this study\nThis project takes advantage of recent advances in knowl-\nedge about the molecular-genetic basis of PDB, with\nadvances in therapeutics to address an important clinical\nquestion that is of relevance to patients with Paget's dis-\nease and their families. The project provides added value\nin that modern techniques in behavioural science will be\napplied to a specific issue in the treatment of Paget's dis-\nease, while at the same time investigating more general\ntheories of human behaviour. Using the Self-Regulation\nModel, we will investigate how genetic information and\npreventive opportunities affect self-regulation via illness\nrepresentations and, using the Theory of Planned Behav-\niour, how uptake of the offer of genetic testing and treat-\nment is predicted by the constructs found to predict\nbehaviour in other settings. Thus the findings will be rele-\nvant to these theories. They will also contribute to ongo-\ning work to integrate these two models in understanding\nbehaviour related to illness.\nIn addition, the knowledge gained from this investigation\nwould be relevant to other musculoskeletal diseases such\nas osteoporosis, which also have a strong genetic compo-\nnent, and which can be prevented by bisphosphonates\nand hormone replacement therapy. With completion of\nthe human genome project, and advances in human\nmolecular genetics, it is probable that DNA testing with\nsingle genetic markers or combinations of markers will be\noffered for a wide range of other chronic diseases for\nwhich effective treatments are available. The results of the\npresent research project will also be of direct relevance to\nthe development of programmes of genetic testing and\npreventative intervention for these conditions.\nStudy aim\nThe aims of the GaP study are to understand factors that\nmight influence the acceptability of an offer of a pro-\ngramme of genetic screening and preventative treatment\nto families of Paget's disease sufferers.\nThe specific research questions are:\n1. a) What do individuals with Paget's disease think\nwould influence the involvement of their relatives in a\nprogramme of genetic testing and preventative treatment?\nand;\nb) What do relatives of Paget's disease sufferers think\nwould influence them in accepting an offer of a pro-\ngramme of genetic testing and preventative treatment?\n2. Do the following factors affect acceptability of a pro-\ngramme of genetic testing and preventative treatment in\nrelatives of Paget's disease sufferers?\n\u2022 Illness and emotional representations of Paget's disease;\n\u2022 Treatment representations;\n\u2022 Presentation of the disease in affected relative(s) (age at\nonset, impairment, activity limitations, participation\nrestrictions; family history as a function of the number of\naffected relatives and the relationship to the Subject);\n\u2022 Respondent characteristics (age, gender and health);\n\u2022 Beliefs of other family members; and\n\u2022 The nature of the treatment offered.\nBy answering these research questions, this study will cast\nlight on the feasibility of developing a programme of\ngenetic testing and preventative treatment for individuals\nwho carry SQSTM1 mutations that are at high risk of\ndeveloping Paget's disease. Since we do not yet know\nwhether prophylactic bisphosphonate therapy would be\neffective in preventing Paget's disease or its complications,\nwe envisage that the results of the present study would be\nused to inform the design of a randomised controlled trial\nto investigate the efficacy of prophylactic bisphosphonate\ntherapy in people with SQSTM1 mutations. Such a study\nwould form the topic of a future research project.\nAn overview of the GaP study\nThe GaP study has two stages:\nStage 1: This part of the study will address the first research\nquestion and aims to identify factors that would influence\ninvolvement of relatives not known to have Paget's dis-Page 4 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2006, 6:71 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/6\/71ease in a programme of genetic screening and preventative\ntreatment.\nStage 2: This part of the study is not part of the current pro-\ntocol, and will comprise a postal questionnaire study of\npeople without Paget's disease but who are relatives of\npeople with Paget's disease.\nMethods\/design for stage 1\nStage 1 will employ semi-structured interviews with indi-\nviduals suffering from Paget's disease, and their relatives\nwho have not been diagnosed as suffering from Paget's\ndisease. The results of Stage 1 will inform the develop-\nment of a TPB-based questionnaire for Stage 2.\nThe interviews with individuals suffering from Paget's dis-\nease will use the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB)-\nbased [26].\nSubjects and recruitment\nIndividuals with Paget's disease will be identified from an\nestablished cohort: The PRISM trial.\nThe PRISM cohort involves 1331 patients with Paget's dis-\nease. The PRISM trial involves 39 collaborating centres\nranging in size from 3 trial participants to approx 250 trial\nparticipants.\nFor this part of the study we will identify potential partic-\nipants from 7 centres collaborating in the PRISM trial.\nIdentifying subjects\nA purposive sample of individuals with Paget's disease\nidentified from the PRISM study will be invited to partici-\npate. Participating individuals will be asked to identify\nfirst and second-degree relatives without Paget's disease\nwho they think might also be interested in taking part in\nthe study. These individuals will be invited to participate\nin separate interviews. Relatives identified by this proce-\ndure will be selected for the study to represent a range of\nfamily relationships (e.g. siblings, children, grandchil-\ndren) and living conditions (e.g. living in same house,\nnearby, or far away). A sequential approach to sampling\nwill therefore be used.\nFor this stage of the study, individuals will be approached\nfrom a restricted selection of PRISM centres (Table 1.).\nThese 3 groups of centres represent regions of the UK with\nvarying incidences of Paget's disease. A low incidence of\nPaget's disease occurs in Scotland, whereas Manchester\nand Liverpool are well recognised as areas of high inci-\ndence of Paget's disease. Lancashire is considered to be the\nglobal 'hotspot' for Paget's. The southern England region\nrepresents an area with an incidence rate between those of\nthe northern England and Scottish regions.\nContacting subjects\nA letter will be sent to probands inviting them to partici-\npate in an interview together with study information leaf-\nlets. The letter will include a 'tear off' section to return (in\na reply paid envelope) if they are interested in discussing\nthe study further. Probands will also be asked to provide\ncontact details of one or two relatives who may also like\nto participate in an interview.\nA letter will be sent to relatives identified by probands\ninviting them to participate in an interview together with\nstudy information leaflets. The letter will include a 'tear\noff' section to return (in a reply paid envelope) if they are\ninterested in discussing the study further.\nA researcher will telephone those who return the slip, and\nwho are interested in taking part, to discuss the study fur-\nther. If the person is still interested, an appropriate time\nand place for interview, and arrangements for formal con-\nsent will be discussed. There will be no follow-up of those\nprobands or relatives that decline to participate or who do\nnot reply.\nA Thank You letter will be sent to probands and relatives\ntaking part in Stage 1, once each individual interview is\ncompleted.\nSample size\nSampling will continue until saturation, i.e. no 'new' ideas\nare being introduced within the three TPB beliefs (behav-\nioural, normative and control) and 5 SRM domains (iden-\ntity, cause, consequences, cure\/control, timeline) plus\nemotional representations). It is expected that this will\ninvolve 10\u201320 individuals from the PRISM cohort\ntogether with 10\u201320 relatives of these affected individuals.\nPurposive sampling will be used to identify probands and\nrelatives to be approached for participation in this stage.\nTable 1: The pool of probands available for the study, and their geographical location.\nPool of probands available (approx.)\n1. Scotland \u2013 Aberdeen\/Dundee 75\n2. Northern England \u2013 Manchester\/Sheffield\/Keighley 160\n3. Southern England \u2013 London\/Southampton 30Page 5 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2006, 6:71 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/6\/71Subjects are not chosen at random but instead are chosen\nbecause they are expected to facilitate investigation of the\nrange of views and opinions relevant to the research. The\naim of sampling is therefore to maximise variety for anal-\nysis. Subjects will be purposively selected to include a\ngood spread across the following factors:\nProbands\n\u2022 Gender (male, female);\n\u2022 Age (<40 years, 41\u201360 years, >61 years);\n\u2022 Severity of disease (monostotic, polyostotic);\n\u2022 Time elapsed since diagnosis (<5 years, > 5 years); and\n\u2022 Family history (Yes, No).\nRelatives\n\u2022 Gender (male, female);\n\u2022 Age (<40 years, 41\u201360 years, >61 years);\n\u2022 Severity of disease in proband (monostotic, polyos-\ntotic);\n\u2022 Relationship to proband (parent, sibling, grandparent,\naunt\/uncle); and\n\u2022 Living proximity to proband (within 50 miles, further\nthan 50 miles).\nAnne Langston will undertake selection of interviewees,\nand the interviewer (Clare Robertson) will be blinded to\nthese details.\nExclusion criteria\nExclusion criteria include:\n\u2022 Known* limited life expectancy (under one year); or\n\u2022 Aged less than 18 years.\n* The caveat of 'known' is used, as it may not be possible to\ndetermine limited life expectancy of relatives.\nA lower age limit has been imposed (minimum age of 18\nyears). Clinical studies suggest that people with SQSTM1\nmutations develop Paget's disease from approximately 45\nyears of age onwards [9]. Clinical intuition would suggest\nthat starting a programme of preventative treatment at age\n40 years would be therefore be appropriate. However, the\nclinical evidence to support this is still lacking. In addi-\ntion, it is likely that a psychologically 'acceptable' age for\nbeginning preventative treatment will differ from that\nindicated by existing evidence. As such, we propose to\ninclude all adult relatives of probands to determine the\neffect of age of the acceptability of genetic testing, and pre-\nventative treatment.\nSpecial arrangements for including people with specific \ncommunication needs\nWe have not made special arrangements for non-English\nspeaking subjects for two reasons:\nA model of the relationship between explanatory and dependent variablesFigure 2\nA model of the relationship between explanatory and dependent variables.\nTreatment\nrepresentations\nProbands\u2019\nexperience of PDB \nObjective factors\nof treatment \nRespondent\ncharacteristics\nIllness\nrepresentations\nAcceptability,\nLikelihood of\nuptakePage 6 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2006, 6:71 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/6\/711. Providing multi-lingual facilities for this small number\nof interviews will be logistically and financially prohibi-\ntive;\n2. Paget's disease is rare in non-Caucasians and therefore\nwe anticipate that English will be the first language of the\nmajority of eligible individuals within the UK.\n3. It has not proved necessary to provide special arrange-\nments for participants of the PRISM trial, and therefore it\nis not anticipated that the requirement will exist for this\nstudy.\nParticipants whose first language is not English will not\nautomatically be excluded from the study if they are either\nable to communicate in English, or an interpreter is avail-\nable to assist with communication. Such arrangements\nwill be accommodated, if it is practicable to do so, on an\nindividual basis.\nIndividuals with limited life expectancy are excluded from\nStage 1 of the study as the interview process may be cog-\nnitively and emotionally taxing for them.\nIndividuals with known limited hearing ability may be\nexcluded from Stage 1 due to practical difficulties of carry-\ning out an interview and the distress and frustration this\nmay cause the participant. If a participant is deaf but can\nlip-read, or has a friend or family member who can use\nSign Language for them, the individual will not be\nexcluded. Since deafness caused by Paget's disease of the\nskull is an important complication of Paget's disease,\nevery attempt will be made to include these individuals in\nStage 1 of the study, where practicable and where it will\nnot cause distress to the participant.\nInformation leaflets and consent forms will be made\navailable in large print upon request.\nSetting\nFor Stage 1, identified PRISM probands and relatives will\nbe invited to interview at home or in a convenient clinical\nor research environment. The place of the interview will\nbe according to the subject's preference. Travel expenses\nincurred by the subject will be reimbursed. Interviews will\nbe tape-recorded and will be conducted face-to-face to\nallow the interviewer to counsel for consent.\nConsent process\nConsent will be sought at interview and participating\nprobands and relatives will be asked to sign a consent\nform. One copy will be kept by the participants and one\nreturned to the researcher.\nThe consent form has been designed in accordance with\ncurrent ethical good practice [28]. The consent form\nexplicitly states that genetic testing is not available as part\nof this study.\nWithdrawal of subjects\nIndividuals will be able to withdraw from the process at\nany time. If individuals wish to withdraw their consent\nafter the interview has taken place, the audio recording\nand any associated transcript will be destroyed if specifi-\ncally requested. They will not be contacted for participa-\ntion in Stage 2 or future research.\nMeasures\nSemi-structured interview schedules will be developed to\naddress Behavioural, Normative and Control beliefs using\nthe TPB preliminary interview format [26,29], and for\nprobands will also address illness perceptions using an\ninterview schedule based on the IPQ format [22].\nFor probands, the interview will also address barriers and\nfacilitators to inviting their non-Pagetic relatives to partic-\nipate in interviews about genetic testing and preventative\ntreatment (a topic guide will be used). For non-Pagetic rel-\natives, the interview will address barriers and facilitators\nto participating in a programme of genetic testing and pre-\nventative treatment (a topic guide will be used).\nData recording\nWith the permission of the subject, the entire interview\nwill be digitally audio recorded. The subject will be\nassigned an anonymous code (study number). Audio\nrecordings will be labelled with the date of interview and\nstudy number.\nNot all of the interviews will be transcribed. Transcription\nwill occur on a limited selection of interviews (maximum\nof 5) to allow more detailed analysis. When transcription\ndoes take place it will be carried out by a trained data tran-\nscriber (not the interviewer). Pauses, including 'hmmms'\nand 'ahs', and interruptions of one speaker by another will\nalso be indicated in the transcription. Transcribed inter-\nviews will be reviewed by the interviewer responsible for\ndata collection (with reference to the original recording)\nand transcription errors will be rectified. Transcriptions of\ninterviews will follow recognised guidelines and will not\ninclude any identifying information.\nAnalysis\nData will be content-analysed using simple TPB & IPQ\ncoding frameworks. A sequential approach to sampling\nwill be used whereby data will be analysed throughout\nrecruitment on an ongoing basis until either the point of\ndata saturation is reached (where no new responsesPage 7 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2006, 6:71 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/6\/71emerge) or a maximum of 20 probands and 20 relatives\nhave been interviewed.\nEnd of study procedures\nDuring the consent process for the study we will ascertain\nwhether participants would like to be sent a report of the\nstudy results. For those participants indicating that they\nwould like study results, a short report will be prepared\nand circulated at the end of the study.\nOnce the interview is completed the participant will be\nsent a Thank You letter. This will include a tear-off reply\nslip that participants will be asked to return indicating\nwhether or not they would like to participate in Stage 2 of\nthe GaP study.\nConfidentiality\nTranscripts and audio recordings will be kept in separate\nlocked filing cabinets, and destroyed after 20 years in\naccordance with current MRC guidelines.\nThe Study Office, based in the Health Services Research\nUnit (HSRU), is responsible for the confidentiality of all\nstudy records. In accordance with the HSRU code of con-\nduct, all data will be password protected against unau-\nthorised access and stored in accordance with the Data\nProtection Act 1998. All stored data will be anonymised.\nFinance and indemnity\nThe study is supported by a grant from the Medical\nResearch Council (MRC). The University of Aberdeen\nholds the grant, and has accepted Sponsorship responsi-\nbilities for the study, including indemnity for negligent\nand non-negligent harm.\nReporting and dissemination\nA summary of the results of the study will be prepared and\ndistributed, not only to the appropriate funding body, but\nalso to all subjects who take part (if they so wish). Results\nwill be published in peer-reviewed academic journals.\nAbbreviations\nDNA Deoxyribonucleic acid.
