Valid \ninterpretation of archaeological remains depends upon an understanding of \nhow those remains came to their final resting place. Taphonomic processes \ninclude human and non-human effects, and usually archaeological remains \nwill have been exposed to a mixture of both during their history.   \n \n \nIn dealing with human settlements and animal bone assemblages, one of the \nmain taphonomic transformations involving bone will be concerned with food \npreparation and consumption.  However, it can be very difficult to discern \nwhether a bone has been cooked. Previous investigations have attempted to \nidentify differing taphonomic features exhibited by cooked and uncooked \nbones in order to recognise cooking in the archaeological record.  These \nfeatures include fracture patterns (Gifford Gonzalez 1989, Oliver 1993), \nlocation of cutmarks (Gifford Gonzalez 1989, Luff 1994), patterns of burning \ndamage (Binford 1981, Gifford Gonzalez 1989, Albarella & Serjeantson 2000) \nand relative frequencies of skeletal elements within bone assemblages (Speth \n2000).  However, studies into fracture patterns have obtained contradictory \nresults (Alhaique 1997), and cutmarks are often not present or difficult to \nrecognise due to other post-depositional taphonomic alterations. This issue \ncan also complicate  assemblage analysis (Todd & Rapson 1988, for a review \nof all these topics see Lyman 1994).  Some burial experiments have included \ncooked bone in their burial assemblages, however none of these have \nestablished unequivocally whether, or how, cooked bone behaves differently \nwhen buried (Bell et al. 1996; Nicholson 1996, 1998). \n \nDespite these difficulties, the ability to detect cooked bone remains a \ndesirable objective within archaeology (Millard 1998).  The unidentifiable bias \nwhich cooked bone might impart to archaeological assemblages raises doubts \nas to the efficacy of assemblage analyses as well as analyses of single bones \n  4 \nby any of the scientific techniques currently proliferating in archaeological \nscience.  Without understanding the limitations which cooking might place on \nthe data, it will be impossible to know how much faith can be placed in results.  \nThis is notwithstanding the other lines of investigation that might profit from \nsuch a method, such as examining gender relations manifested within food \nprocessing and consumption (Hastorf 1991), and the development and \nintroduction of new technologies (Movius 1966, Lupo & Schmitt 1997). \n \n \nWhen considering cooked bone, we are mainly dealing with three different \nprocesses: \n  \n1. Burning \/ Incineration (where the bone is normally in direct contact with fire, \nor an intense heat source) \n2. Roasting \/ Baking (where the bone is protected from the heat source via \ninsulating flesh) \n3. Boiling (where the bone and flesh are heated at a constant temperature, \nmoderated by liquid) \n \nOf these, the first category (burning and incineration) is the only one that has \nhad its physical effects studied in any depth (Shipman et al. 1984, Buikstra & \nSwegle 1989, David 1990, Nicholson 1993, Stiner et al. 1995 ), and as it is \nmore often associated with rubbish disposal than with cooking, it is excluded \nfrom this study.  Experimental work has also shown that when roasted or \nbaked the bone is insulated from the direct heat source such that \ntemperatures experienced by the bone are much reduced.  A study by \nAlhaique (1997) showed that temperatures did not exceed 85 C around the \nbone at an oven temperature of 200 C, and in most cases was much lower; \nfurthermore cooking times for roasting and baking are generally short.  We \ntherefore concentrate on boiled bone, which experiences more extreme \nheating, and may be prolonged (e.g. soup making and the rendering of bones \nfor grease and fat; Brink 1997, Lupo & Schmitt 1997, Saint-Germain 1997).  \n \n  5 \n \nUsing a suite of techniques designed to determine the diagenetic state of the \nbone, boiling has been characterised in terms of the diagenetic effects it has \non bone, allowing comparison with altered bone in the burial environment.  \nBone is a composite of protein (mainly collagen) and mineral (a form of \nhydroxyapatite, often referred to as bioapatite; Millard 1998, Collins et al. this \nvolume,).  Our approach has been designed to examine the various \ncomponents separately as well as their interaction, and how their alteration \naffects the bone during diagenesis.   \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \n \nHeating experiments have been carried out on whole bones and bone \npowders, and their effects characterised using the techniques detailed below.  \nWhole bovine rib bones were boiled in pans on a gas stove, with samples \ntaken after 3, 9, 27 and 81 hrs. Bone powder (bovine tibia) was sealed with \nexcess water (in the presence of air) in airtight tubes, and then heated at \n95\u00b0C, 85\u00b0C, and 75 C for durations of 1 week, 1 month and 4 months \nrespectively. Those experiments carried out on whole bones were intended to \nreplicate cooking conditions, with cooking times reflecting those which might \nbe obtained through normal food preparation practises (3 and 9 hours), \nextended cooking times (27 hours) which might come about through cooking \npractices such as those documented in the Anglo-Saxon and Mediaeval \nperiods (Tannahill 1988, Hagen 1992, Reynolds 1995) where bones were \noften left in a constant stockpot for days on end and repeatedly heated, or \nthrough the rendering of bones for grease, as observed in ethnographic \nstudies (Brink 1997, Lupo & Schmitt 1997, Saint-Germain 1997), and a very \nextreme cooking time to provide an end member for the time series (81 \nhours).  Experiments carried out on homogenised powders were used to \ndetermine key diagenetic parameters. \n \n  \n  6 \nFTIR Spectroscopy \n \n \nThe bone powder is finely ground and pressed into a potassium bromide disk, \nwhich is scanned using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (Stiner et al. \n1995).  The infrared splitting factor (SF) is determined as in Weiner and Bar-\nYosef (1990).  The splitting factor derived gives an indication of the stability of \nthe bone crystals and is a function of both crystal size and the extent of the \nordering within the crystal lattice (Stiner et al. 1995). Large, highly ordered \ncrystals will give higher splitting factors than small, disordered crystals.  The \nsplitting factor varies from splitting factors of around SF2.7  0.1 for fresh \nbone to values of SF 7 for calcined or highly fossilised bone (Stiner et \nal.1995) \n \n    \nCollagen Extractions \n \n \nWhole bone is crushed and ground to a fine powder in an agate pestle and \nmortar (for the test tube heated powders a Nitrogen-cooled spex mill was \nused before heating). Bone powders are demineralised in 0.6M HCl overnight \nat 4 C.  The remaining acid insoluble fraction is rinsed three times in distilled \nwater, then freeze-dried and weighed, the result given as a weight per cent \ninsoluble fraction.  For the experimental powders this insoluble fraction is \npresumed to be collagen, for archaeological bone a C:H:N analysis is carried \nout in order to confirm the residue\u2019s identity by its C:N ratio.  For comparisons \nwith archaeological data, in this paper the weight per cent insoluble fraction of \nthe heated powders has been converted into a per cent nitrogen value.  This \nis accomplished by using the simple formula [X * 0.185 = %N value] where X \nis the weight per cent insoluble fraction and 0.185 is representative of the \nnitrogen fraction in deamidated collagen.  Using a standard value of 23% by \nweight for the insoluble fraction of modern bovine bone, the formula calculates \na %N of 4.3 and an atomic C:N ratio of 3.2. This formula assumes that most \n  7 \nof the soluble proteins contained within the archaeological bone will have \nbeen leached out during burial or washed away during pre-treatment of the \nsample.  \n \n   \nNitrogen Analyses \n \n \nIn order to make the measurements, bone samples were homogenized to a \npowder; two analyses were provided on each sample.  The analysis was \ncarried out using a Carlo Erba 1106 Elemental Analyser in accordance with \nthe manufacturers instructions, giving a per cent nitrogen content, which can \nbe used as a proxy for the amount of collagen contained within a bone \n(Hedges et al. 1995). \n \n   \nMercury Intrusion Porosimetry \n \n \nSections of bone between 400 mg and 1200 mg were cut using a hacksaw \nand dried (freeze-dried, or dried for 48 hours at 60 C) prior to analysis.  HgIP \nmeasurements were made on a Micrometrics Autopore II 9220 at the \nUniversity of Newcastle upon Tyne, with mercury being intruded into the bone \nunder increasing pressures.  The intrusion volumes are then density corrected \nusing the measured bulk density of the sample, and plotted as a pore size \ndistribution (PSD) graph.   Data are reported as ml of Hg intruded per ml of \nbone and pore sizes are calculated assuming a contact angle between \nmercury and apatite of 163.1  (Joschek et al. 2000). \n \n  \nHistology \n \n \n  8 \nSections of the bone are fixed in resin, and polished before examination under \nreflected light (Hedges et al. 1995).  We have used the Histological Index of \nHedges et al. (1995), which is a graded system from 0 to 5, with 0 \nrepresenting no surviving histological structure, and 5 indicating near-perfect \npreservation of histology.  Histological structure is mainly influenced by soil \nmicro-organisms (Hackett 1981, Bell 1990, Jans, this volume). \n \n \nRESULTS & DISCUSSION \n \n \nTable 1 shows the diagenetic parameters as measured on the time series of \nboiled bone, as well as standard values for modern bovine bone and \ndeproteinated bovine bone.  Deproteination is achieved through hydrazine \ntreatment to remove the collagen with minimal crystal alteration, following the \nmethod of Nielsen-Marsh (1997).   Note the difference in values between the \nuncooked bovine rib and the modern bovine standard (tibia). Although within \nexperimental error, the variance can also be attributed to the different skeletal \nelements that are being examined.   \n \nAs the bone is boiled, protein is lost and crystallinity increases, as does \nporosity.  Histology remains unchanged.  Figure 1 shows the correlation \nbetween nitrogen loss and splitting factor increase. There is a remarkable \nlinearity shown, and the correlation is extremely high.  Similar relationships \nhave been noticed when examining archaeological bone, with bones low in \nnitrogen generally exhibiting higher crystallinity (Person et al. 1995, Sillen & \nParkington 1996, Nielsen-Marsh & Hedges 2000), although the issue is rarely \nas clear-cut due to the many confounding factors in the burial environment.  \nThe main increase in porosity is in the range of pore sizes less than 0.1 m. \nThe large peak that appears at 0.02 m with extensive boiling is an indication \nof this (Figure 2). This peak is also observed in deproteinated bone, and has \nbeen attributed to the loss of collagen from sub-fibrillar size pores (Nielsen-\nMarsh 1999).  There is also considerable mineral alteration shown by the \n  9 \nbones that display this peak, raising the possibility that some of this porosity is \nlinked to the rearrangement of the crystal structure into a coarser \nconfiguration, as speculated on by Nielsen-Marsh & Hedges (2000).  If the \nporosity in this region is plotted against protein content, we see a linear trend \n(R2= 0.834, rising to 0.915 on addition of archaeological data) supporting a \ndirect relationship (Figure 3). Furthermore, when the crystallinity of the same \nsamples is plotted against small pore porosity, this correlation disappears, \nimplying that crystal rearrangement has little or no influence on this feature.  \n    \n \nSmith et al. (this vol.) reviews the archaeological data in figure 3 in more \ndepth, documenting the diagenetic state of bones from a southern Italian \nmediaeval cemetery in Apigliano.  These bones are curious because they \nexhibit extremely rapid collagen loss with no microbial attack.  They share \nmany characteristics with boiled bone, including the sharp peak in the small \npore region, extensive mineral alteration and intact histology.  This same peak \nis also exhibited by deproteinated bone, though the crystallinity is not as \naffected.  That the traces for deproteinated bone and severely boiled bone are \nsimilar is to be expected, as collagen is lost through chemically mediated \nhydrolysis (Collins et al. 1995) in both cases, accelerated by different \nmechanisms (hydrazine hydrate and increased temperature).  Finding such a \ncorrespondence in archaeological bone is surprising however, the more so \nconsidering their relatively young age. Given that these are human bones, \nfrom articulated burials, the likelihood of cooking is remote.  It shows that the \nphysico-chemical signature of boiling is not unique, and that diagenesis can \nmirror the effects of cooking. What may be more useful to archaeological \nscience is the possibility that boiling can be an analogue of certain types of \nburial diagenesis, and with further study may facilitate greater understanding \nof these diagenetic processes.   Boiling also increases porosity at larger pore \nsizes, which might have more even more severe ramifications in terms of \nburial diagenesis, as it has been shown that the larger pore sizes have a \ngreater influence on the rate of bone dissolution than small pores (Pike et al. \n2001).  \n  \n  10 \n \nIn order to further clarify the relationship between the loss of collagen and the \nincrease in crystallinity, heating experiments were carried out on bone \npowders at different temperatures as detailed above.  Figure 4 shows the \nresults of these experiments, superimposed on a background of \narchaeological data (samples from Elands Bay Cave analysed in Sillen & \nParkington 1996, samples from Yarnton, Brean Down, Bercy and Poundbury \nanalysed in Nielsen-Marsh 1997, and Pleistocene bones analysed in Nielsen-\nMarsh & Hedges 2000).  It can be seen that not only does the relationship \nbetween collagen loss and mineral alteration hold, but also that it is time and \ntemperature independent, at least until the vast majority of the collagen is lost \nfrom the bone.  The archaeological data also shows this trend.  The dataset \nconsists of bones from different periods (Pleistocene through to Anglo-Saxon) \nand vastly differing environments.  \n \n \nCollagen is gelatinised more rapidly at higher temperatures, and its loss \ndisplays a high correspondence with changing crystallinity.  The relationship \nbetween collagen loss and crystallinty is echoed in archaeological samples.  \nThe relationship between mineral and organic is fundamental to bone \narchitecture, and bone survival.   Experiments have previously demonstrated \nthe presence of an organic \u2018diffusional barrier\u2019 within the bone matrix that has \nto be removed before any ion exchange affecting the bone mineral can take \nplace (Walsh et al. 1994).  In our experiments, the rate of mineral alteration is \nlinked to the rate of gelatinisation.  A decrease in mechanical strength has \npreviously been noted in both archaeological bone and cooked bone (Pearce \n& Luff 1994, Turner-Walker & Parry 1995,) and is often cited as a key factor in \ndetermining bone preservation.   Boiling, in disrupting the mineral-organic \ninterface and increasing porosity might have an important influence on bone \nsurvival, but this will be entirely dependent on the duration of cooking.   \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n  11 \n \nIn mirroring the patterns shown by archaeological bone we can conclude that \nthe boiling process is to some extent an analogue of diagenesis, with similar \nprocesses occurring (loss of collagen, increasing crystallinity, increasing \nporosity).  We have also shown, however, that it requires boiling for extensive \nperiods to fashion these changes, with what could be considered conventional \nboiling times (1 \u2013 9 hours) having little or no physico-chemical effects. This \nmight explain the difficulties experienced by previous researchers in \ndistinguishing cooked from uncooked bone.  None of the bones utilised in \nburial experiments were cooked for longer than an hour (Bell et al. 1996, \nNicholson 1996, 1998), and the bones used in fracturing experiments were \nalso not heated for any considerable length of time (Alhaique 1997).   \n \nWhat our experiments cannot tell us is the fate of cooked bone over \narchaeological timescales.  Bone which has been severely boiled is unlikely to \nsurvive, due to its high porosity and reduced mechanical strength, although it \nalso has little organic content to attract further scavenging damage or \nmicrobial attack, and its altered, more stable mineral organisation may be less \nreactive in the burial environment.   \n \nThere is a possibility that the effects of boiling, although not detectable by our \nanalyses, might cause accelerated diagenesis through a kind of \u2018loosening\u2019 of \nthe bone structure.  Once in the ground, if boiling has altered the bone, \nmineral alteration and microbial attack might proceed more rapidly.  Increased \nporosity might have a severe effect, with a greater surface area available for \ndissolution processes (Trueman 1999, Pike et al. 2000).  Some indications of \nthe possible effects of cooking are given by differential scanning calorimetry \nanalysis of bone.  Demineralised collagen from a bone cooked for 7 hours \nshowed a significant decrease in its gelatinisation temperature (Nielsen Marsh \net al. 2000), although other diagenetic parameters were not distinguishable \nfrom modern bone (Roberts, unpubl. data).  A weakened collagen helix would \nimply that the association between the collagen and the mineral is also \nweakened (Walsh et al. 1994, Kronick & Cook 1996), which is likely to cause \naccelerated diagenesis. \n  12 \n \n \nCooking can be considered an analogue for burial diagenesis, with similar \npatterns obtained as are observed in archaeological samples.  With further \nstudy this may lead to an increased understanding of the diagenetic \nprocesses, and the varied chemical interactions involved in the deterioration \nof bone.  In terms of identifying cooked bone in the archaeological record, we \nhave discovered no singular feature that is unique to boiling.  However, from \nour initial results we would expect boiled bone to be less resistant to all forms \nof diagenetic alteration, including microbial attack.   \n \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \n \nThis paper results from work carried out for a PhD project funded by NERC at \nNewcastle University.
