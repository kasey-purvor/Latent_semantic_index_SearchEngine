These\nchallenges are being addressed by the federal government in cooperation with civil society with a\nview to scaling up Proambiente into a national programme.\nKeywords: payments for environmental services; reduced emissions from deforestation;\nProambiente; Amazon; small farmers1. INTRODUCTION\nThe growing pace of Amazon deforestation has become\na key issue in the debate on climate change. Globally,\nland use changes including forest loss account for\napproximately 18\u201320% of total greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions. Yet Amazonian deforestation is responsible\nfor three-quarters of GHG emissions in Brazil, which\nis itself the world\u2019s fourth largest emitter after China,\nthe US and Russia. Since the 1960s, the Brazilian\nAmazon has been treated as a virtually free resource\nto be exploited in the name of national development\nwith little or no regard for the huge environmental\nand social costs involved. With some 20% of Brazil\u2019s\nAmazon rainforest now lost to clear-felling, over half\nof the region has been adversely impacted by human\nactivity. It has been estimated that up to 50% of\nthe country\u2019s rainforest could disappear by 2050,\ngenerating a regional average temperature rise of up\nto 48C and a rainfall reduction as high as 20%, with\ndisastrous consequences including widespread \u2018savan-\nnization\u2019 and forest die-back (Betts et al. 2008;\nGreenpeace 2006; INPE 2007; Nepstad et al. 2008;\nSawyer 2008).\nSuccessive military and civilian governments have\nsince the 1960s encouraged settlement through cattle\nranching, logging, soybean cultivation and occupation by\nsmall farmers. Historically, producers in the Amazon\nhave been actively encouraged to remove the rainforest as\nproof of \u2018productive\u2019 activity under land-titling laws and\nfor the acquisition of credit. Environmental policy hastribution of 27 to a Theme Issue \u2018Climate change and the\nhe Amazon\u2019.\n@lse.ac.uk\n1925been based on conservation in protected areas backed up\nby punitive, command-and-control measures. These are\nnecessary but of limited effectiveness on their own in\nfighting increasing rates of deforestation in the region and\nthe consequent loss of environmental services such as\ncarbon sequestration, biodiversity preservation and\nwatershed management.\nA major challenge facing policy-makers today is thus\nhow to move away from the current system of perverse\nincentives which stimulates deforestation, and towards\npolicies that encourage forest preservation along with\nmore sustainable forms of land settlement and\nproduction. The present paper examines Brazil\u2019s very\nembryonic efforts at persuading small farmers to adopt\nsuch practices by paying them for environmental\nservices rendered, encouraging them to limit forest\nremoval, reduce destructive activities such as continu-\nous slash-and-burn farming and set up more sedentary,\necologically friendly production systems such as\nagroforestry and extractivism.\nAfter reviewing Amazon settlement policies and the\npotential importance of providing payments for\nenvironmental services (PES) to small farmers, the\nexperience of Brazil\u2019s pro-poor Proambiente PES\nprogramme will be examined.1 It will be argued that,\ndespite being fraught with problems, Proambiente is one\ntool among many which could reward small producers\nfor enhancing carbon sequestration and biodiversity\nconservation. If an international post-Kyoto framework\nfor encouraging reduced emissions from deforestation\n(RED) beyond 2012 is negotiated under the auspices\nof the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change (UNFCCC), funds for this purpose\ncould be channelled from the North to the South\nthrough official aid and\/or carbon trading.This journal is q 2008 The Royal Society\n1926 A.

PEOPLING THE AMAZON\nFor as long as the development of Amazonia has been\ndiscussed in scientific and policy circles, the role of its\ntraditional and indigenous populations in moulding the\nregion\u2019s past and its future has been marginalized. This\nwas most apparent during the early days of the modern\nsettlement era in the 1970s, when the Amazon was\ntreated as a demographic void by Brazil\u2019s military rulers\nwho urged the allocation of \u2018land without men to men\nwithout land\u2019 (Hall 1989). This conveniently ignored the\npresence of pre-existing populations as the generals\npursued a number of diverse and often conflicting\ngoals. These ranged from national integration and\neconomic modernization to poverty alleviation and social\nstabilization in other regions of the country through the\nexport of \u2018surplus\u2019 people to the \u2018empty\u2019 frontier.\nFor three decades, strong official backing was given\nto large landowners and investors in key sectors such as\nlivestock, logging and mining, which monopolized\ngovernment subsidies. Small settlers, in contrast, were\ndrawn to the region but then usually denied significant\nsupport and largely abandoned to their fate. Further-\nmore, in an exercise of \u2018blaming the victims\u2019, they were\noften portrayed by the politically powerful as destroyers\nof the environment who made little positive contri-\nbution to regional progress (Bourne 1978; Schmink &\nWood 1978; Branford & Glock 1985; Mahar 1988;\nHecht & Cockburn 1989). For many years, the word\npovo (the \u2018people\u2019) was literally, in the eyes of most\npoliticians and official policy-makers, a four-letter\nword, the very antithesis of development.\nThis perception was challenged in the late 1980s and\n1990s by the people themselves. Amazonia\u2019s social\nmovements\u2014the rubber tappers, small producers and\nindigenous groups\u2014vociferously reminded the world\nthat they too played a key role in using and conserving\nnatural resources while promoting economic develop-\nment and serving national interests (Hall 1997). In\nprotest at growing deforestation and abuses such as the\nmurder of rubber tappers\u2019 leader Francisco \u2018Chico\u2019\nMendes in 1988, the international environmental\nlobby, foreign aid agencies and global public opinion\ngenerally aligned with domestic groups to pursue a\nnew policy agenda highlighting the contribution of\nlocal populations to the sustainable development of\nAmazonia. This came at a propitious moment in the\nwake of the Brundtland Report (1987), followed by the\nEarth Summit (1992) held in Rio de Janeiro, a\ncombination of events which sparked significant\nenvironmental policy changes and institutional\nreorganization in Brazil under Presidents Fernando\nCollor de Mello and Jose\u00b4 Sarney (Hall 2000).\nYet despite this recent trend, mainstream environ-\nmental policy in the Amazon has been dominated by a\ncommand-and-control approach based on conserva-\ntion together with the application of punitive measures\nagainst those found guilty of breaking the law.\nImplementation is notoriously difficult in an area a\nhuge as Amazonia. In 2005 Brazil\u2019s environmental\ncontrol agency IBAMA allocated 850 officials to a\nregion of 1.9 million square miles, one staff member for\nevery 2300 square miles on average. Operations are\ngenerally under-funded and only a very small pro-\nportion of fines is ever collected.2Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2008)Approximately 40% of Brazilian Amazonia is\ncurrently set aside in protected areas for both total\nconservation and sustainable use, including indigenous\nreserves. Over 60% of this area involves the direct\nparticipation of resource-user populations in managing\nthese units. A range of projects and programmes both\nwithin and outside of these protected areas has been\ndeveloped to directly benefit local groups such as\nextractivists, small farmers, fishing communities and\nindigenous groups; and producers of various kinds\nwhose livelihoods depend upon the non-destructive use\nof natural resources but which also contribute to local\neconomic development (Hall 1997). Approximately\n20% of Brazilian Amazonia\u2019s current population of\nsome 20 million, or approximately 4 million rural\ninhabitants, still depend for their economic survival on\nthe region\u2019s natural resources. These include, for\nexample, extraction of tree fruits and other crops,\nagroforestry systems, community-based logging, sus-\ntainable fishing and pasture management.\nYet despite significant progress in this area, the vast\nmajority of small farmer settlers in the Amazon still\npractise traditional slash-and-burn farming, which\ncontributes to growing deforestation and environmental\ndegradation. It is estimated that they are responsible for\napproximately 20% of deforestation in Brazilian Ama-\nzonia overall. Cattle ranching and illegal logging (as\nwell as soybean indirectly) account for approximately\n70% and mining for the remainder (Fearnside 2005).\nBy incorporating traditionally marginalized small farm-\ners into sustainable development initiatives such as\nPES, the loss of forest cover and associated environ-\nmental services could be ameliorated.3. PES AND RED\nEnvironmental or ecosystem services \u2018are the con-\nditions and processes through which natural ecosys-\ntems, and the species that make them up, sustain and\nfulfil human life\u2019 (Daily 1997, p. 3). Specific environ-\nmental services associated with preservation and\nagricultural diversification include carbon sequestra-\ntion, watershed management, biodiversity conservation\nand the preservation of landscape beauty. To qualify for\nPES, services rendered should ideally be measurable;\nfor example in terms of tons of carbon captured,\nbiodiversity preserved, deforestation avoided or\nvolume of clean water supplied. PES projects should\nbe monitored for compliance and their performance\ncertified before payments are made to service providers\n(Wunder 2005).\nOfficial subsidies for Amazon settlement have\nhistorically encouraged deforestation rather than con-\nservation.3 Yet PES could help alter this perverse\npattern. One such set of policies involves providing\nfinancial rewards to rural landowners and resource-\nusers who adopt environmentally friendly practices,\nranging from outright conservation to sustainable\ndevelopment techniques. Financial compensation in\nthe form of PES rendered would reward resource-users\nfor their efforts to either preserve forests and other\nnatural resources intact, and\/or introduce production\nsystems that generate economic surplus and sustain\nPayments for environmental services A. Hall 1927\n on September 25, 2012rstb.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from local populations without destroying the resource base\nupon which people\u2019s livelihoods depend.\nMeasures include the conservation of forested areas\ndesignated as \u2018legal reserves\u2019 under Brazil\u2019s Forest\nCode (1965), replanting of forests, introduction of\nagroforestry systems, extraction of forest products such\nas rubber, fruits and nuts, reduction or elimination of\nfire-use in land preparation, pasture management and\nso on. PES schemes offer the potential for channelling\nfinancial rewards to groups of small landowners and\nresource users whose environmental contribution\nwould otherwise remain unrecognized by mainstream\ngovernment policy, which generally favours large-scale,\nexport-oriented commercial producers.\nPolicy initiatives to reduce the rate of tropical\ndeforestation are especially relevant in Brazil where\nforest loss is responsible for three-quarters of national\nGHG emissions and contributes significantly to global\nwarming (Stern 2006). This discussion is also poignant\nin the light of pressures by some developing countries to\nintroduce the notion of \u2018avoided deforestation\u2019 as a valid\ncriterion for carbon offsetting. This is currently not\npermitted under the Clean Development Mechanism\n(CDM) during the first phase of the Kyoto Protocol\n(2008\u20132012), which allows offsets to be generated only\nthrough reforestation and afforestation projects.\nHowever, the issue of reduced emissions from defores-\ntation (RED) is under consideration by the scientific\nbody of the UNFCCC. This refers to the maintenance\nof standing forest in order to reduce GHG emissions\n(Ebeling & Yasue\u00b4 2008; Lemos & Roberts 2008).\nPressure is mounting to include incentives for RED\nduring the second phase of the Kyoto Protocol after\n2012. The World Bank is leading this initiative and is\nseeking approval from the G8 for a \u2018Global Forest\nAlliance\u2019 (GFA) which would bring together major\nconservation NGOs and the private sector. Within the\nGFA, a $300 million Forest Carbon Partnership Facility\n(FCPF) would pilot test schemes for reducing emissions\nfrom deforestation. Even Brazil, which for a variety of\nreasons has long resisted such pressures (Fearnside\n2001), has warmed somewhat to the idea. Although it\ncurrently rejects the market-based approach suggested\nby the Coalition of Rainforest Nations (CRN 2007),4\nBrazil has proposed instead a \u2018compensated reduction\u2019\nfacility to pay countries that reduce rates of deforestation\nfrom an international donor fund (Santilli et al. 2005;\nLemos & Roberts 2008).4. PES AND PROAMBIENTE\nThis section will consider the emergence of PES\npolicies in Brazil and the conception of Proambiente as\na mechanism for benefiting small farmers in the\nAmazon. It examines the structure and initial results\nof the scheme in compensating small producers,\ntogether with some implications for future PES policy\nin Brazil, before considering wider issues under\nproposed RED initiatives.\n(a) The PES principle\nPES in Brazil have so far been delivered largely through\nindustrial carbon sequestration initiatives under the\nCDM such as landfill projects as well as a handful ofPhil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2008)forestry schemes mainly outside of the Amazon.5 Yet\nthe potential for including small farmers and other\nresource users in certain key areas of Amazonia as part\nof a future RED strategy for emissions reductions\npolicy could be significant. This would serve not just as\none vital element of environmental action, offering\nfinancial incentives to enhance conservation and\ndevelopment efforts. It would also strengthen people\u2019s\nlivelihoods and help support the activities of those\ngrassroots groups that act as custodians of the forest\nand suppliers of key services. Research elsewhere has\nshown that \u2018direct payments benefit poor farmers by\nimproving cash flows, providing a fungible store of\nwealth, and diversifying sources of household income\u2019\n(Ferraro & Kiss 2002, p. 1718).\nIn Brazil, the potential of such direct payments for\npromoting conservation and development was realized\nearly on. In 2000 rural unions, environmental NGOs\nand community groups in Brazil\u2019s Amazon region\njointly conceived a \u2018Programme for the Socio-Environ-\nmental Development of Rural Family Production\u2019\n(Proambiente), following lengthy debates over the\nfuture of small-scale production in Amazonia.6 This\nwould reward small farmers and other producers for\nproviding environmental services in 12 key areas or\n\u2018poles\u2019 distributed over several Amazon states.7 With\nthe election in late 2002 of Luiz Ina\u00b4cio Lula da Silva,\nBrazil\u2019s first working class president, and a PT\ngovernment seen as favourable to grassroots interests,\nthe project was transferred from civil society to the\nMinistry of the Environment from 1 January, 2004.\nProambiente is \u2018.directed at rural family production,\nagro-forestry, extractivism, fishing, indigenous and\nother forms of traditional production.\u2019 Under the\nscheme, such groups \u2018.would cease to be regarded\nmerely as suppliers of primary produce but be valued for\ntheir multi-functional contributions to economic\nproduction, social inclusion and preservation of the\nenvironment. (facilitating). compensation for\nenvironmental services rendered to Brazil and the\nworld\u2019 (Proambiente 2003, pp. 2\u20136). Specific environ-\nmental services in this context were defined as:\n(i) reduction or avoidance of deforestation; (ii) carbon\nsequestration; (iii) recuperation of ecosystem hydro-\nlogical functions; (iv) soil conservation; (v) preservation\nof biodiversity; and (vi) reduction of forest fire risks.\nAvoided deforestation and carbon sequestration\nwould be monitored through direct indicators, and\nthe remaining impacts via indirect measures inherent in\nthe programme\u2019s certification process (Proambiente\n2003). In this way, it was expected that reductions in\nforest loss and the amount of carbon thus captured by\nchanges in land use against an established baseline\ncould be monitored for each development \u2018pole\u2019.\nThe process followed a number of fixed stages:\n(i) preparation of sustainable development plans for\ncommunities (Planos de Desenvolvimento Sustenta\u00b4vel ),\n(ii) drawing up of resource utilization plans (Planos de\nUtilizac\u00b8a\u02dco), (ii) negotiation of community agreements\n(Acordos Comunita\u00b4rios), (iii) auditing of activities for\ntheir rendering of environmental services (Auditorias\nde Campo), (iv) certification of activities (Ce\u00b4dula de\nCertificac\u00b8a\u02dco de Servic\u00b8os Ambientais), and (v) disbursement\nof payments.\n1928 A. Hall Payments for environmental services\n on September 25, 2012rstb.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from Independent monitoring would be undertaken using\na combination of satellite imagery, mapping and field\nchecks on the ground. Assuming a favourable outcome,\nparticipating households would be paid the equivalent\nof half a minimum salary per month (US$95) to reward\nthe provision of environmental services. This verifica-\ntion process would be repeated on an annual basis to\njustify the continuation of such payments. Shortfalls\nin the provision of environmental services by partici-\npants would result in reduced monthly payments on a\nsliding scale.\nProambiente is conceived in principle as a cross-\nsector initiative involving various ministries although,\nas noted below, such collaboration has proved proble-\nmatic. Led by the Ministry of the Environment (MMA)\nunder the Secretariat for Extractivism and Sustainable\nDevelopment, agricultural extension support is pro-\nvided through the Ministry of Agrarian Development\n(MDA) and its Secretariat for Family Agriculture. In\nthe original plan, subsidized credit for small producers\n(PRONAF) was to be made available via the MDA and\nthe Bank of Brazil, although this has not materialized\ndue to a series of problems mentioned below.\nCertification would be the responsibility of the official\nagricultural research organization EMBRAPA and\nother agencies, while monitoring of carbon stocks\nwould be undertaken by the Ministry of Science and\nTechnology (MCT), EMBRAPA and the civil house-\nhold (casa civil) of the Presidency.\nA Socio-Environmental Fund (Fundo Socioambiental )\nto be administered by the MMAwas conceived to finance\npayments to farmers, bringing together fixed sources\nfrom government and variable contributions from\ninternational donors and private companies, including\ncarbon offset purchases (Proambiente 2003). Following\nsuccessful piloting of Proambiente, it was hoped that the\nPES principle would be substantially scaled up and\napplied as a national policy.\n(b) Results and challenges for Proambiente\nAfter 4 years under implementation, Proambiente has\nhad mixed results. Of the 12 original \u2018poles\u2019, 10 have\nbecome operational with some 4200 participating\nfamilies, of whom a total of 1768 (42%) have received\ntotal payments averaging R$650 (US$325) per house-\nhold (Viana et al. 2006). For legal reasons it has not so\nfar been possible to set up a permanent fund as\noriginally envisaged. Thus, it was necessary to seek\n\u2018emergency\u2019 support through the Demonstration Pro-\njects component of the G7 Pilot Programme, which has\nhistorically supported Proambiente-type activities in\nagroforestry, extractivism and related fields. Yet this\nwas a stop-gap solution that could not do justice to the\nproject\u2019s original financial objectives in paying farmers.\nThis is, not unsurprisingly, regarded by Proambiente\nfarmers very much as a token payment that fell far short\nof what had been promised.\nProphetically, an official assessment of the prospects\nfor Proambiente made shortly after the project\u2019s hand-\nover to government in 2004 had already predicted that\na shortage of funding and support capacity would\nenable less than half of the programme\u2019s target number\nof families to be reached beyond the 2-year initial phase\n(MMA 2004). Despite the limited scale and effectivelyPhil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2008)\u2018pilot\u2019 nature of Proambiente, however, the government\nhopes to use it as a model for the introduction of a\nnational PES programme (Viana et al. 2006). Yet\nbefore this is even remotely possible, a number of major\nfinancial, legal, political and bureaucratic challenges\nhave to be addressed.\nThe first hurdle to be overcome is the lack of legal\nrecognition in Brazil at federal level for the concept of\nenvironmental services and their economic value.\nThough Brazilian legislation makes provision for\nwater-use charges, for example, it does not place an\neconomic value on the water-conservation role of\nlandowners. Brazil has a number of instruments that\nprovide PES, but it has no national PES policy. Closely\nallied to this is a second major obstacle, the absence of a\npermanent source of public funding drawn from\ntaxation and compensatory economic instruments to\nguarantee some financial continuity for Proambiente.\nBrazil\u2019s first such legislation has recently been\nenacted by the state government of Amazonas, which\nin June 2007 introduced a \u2018Law on climatic change,\nenvironmental conservation and sustainable develop-\nment\u20198 (Amazonas 2007; Radiobra\u00b4s 2007). A \u2018Sustain-\nable Amazonas Foundation\u2019 has been set up with a\ntrust fund of R$40 million (US$20 million). Half is\nprovided by the state government and half by the\nBradesco bank. Further funds will be raised from\nthe sale of carbon credits for avoided deforestation in\nthe voluntary market, generating up to an estimated\nUS$100 million a year (FOE 2007). Under the\nscheme, a monthly \u2018forest grant\u2019 (Bolsa Floresta) of\nR$50 (US$25) will be paid to over 4000 households in\nfive \u2018sustainable development\u2019 protected areas, extend-\ning to 8500 families by the end of 2008. The aim is to\nsupport traditional populations in their pursuit of non-\ndestructive activities such as extractivism, fishing and\ntree fruit cultivation and to discourage illegal deforesta-\ntion. In future, Brazil\u2019s states could bear a primary\nresponsibility for forest management and introduction\nof PES schemes.9\nFederal legalization for PES is being addressed by\nthe national government (in late 2007) through draft\nbills, two of which have been presented in the Chamber\nof Deputies, and a third is to be added.10 When and if\napproved by Congress, this new legislation would\nestablish the concept of PES in Brazil and set up a\nNational Programme of PES or \u2018Green Fund\u2019 (Bolsa\nVerde) for small farmers to be financed by international\ndonations. A third bill is to be introduced by the\nExecutive which would attempt to secure more\npermanent funding from the national budget and a\nvariety of other domestic as well as international\nsources.11 Together, these three bills could provide a\nlegal and financial basis for expanding Proambiente into\na national programme. It has been estimated that a\nlarge-scale PES programme involving 10% of Brazilian\nAmazonia\u2019s small farmer population in degraded areas\nwould cost R$90 (US$45) million a year to conserve\n3.75 Mha\u2014approximately one-tenth of the rainforest\n(Viana et al. 2006). However, it would also be necessary\nto increase core government funding for the MMA,\nwhose implementation capacity has been undermined\nby inadequate allocations and by spending cutbacks,\nPayments for environmental services A. Hall 1929\n on September 25, 2012rstb.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from suggesting a low official prioritization of environmental\npolicy (Dutra et al. 2006; Arruda et al. 2007).\nA third set of issues concerns the compatibility of\nProambiente with other government policies for small\nproducers and the extent of cooperation among\nrelevant ministries and implementing agencies.12 For\nexample, small-scale rural production is the responsi-\nbility of the Ministry of Agrarian Development (MDA)\nwhich uses diverse lines of agricultural credit through\nits National Programme for Strengthening Family\nFarming (PRONAF). However, the bulk of this\nfunding (85%) is geared towards investments and\nrunning costs for low-risk borrowers regarded favour-\nably by bank managers. These categories (C, D and E)\ninvolve more conventional agro-livestock systems\nproviding predictable income flows, collateral and\nwith low rates of default (up to 2%). Credit for poorer\nfarmers on agrarian reform settlements and for special\ngroups such as youth and women (categories A, B and\nA\/C) is heavily subsidized (40%) and carries default\nrates of over 30%.\nBank managers are reluctant to release funds for\nProambiente-type activities, especially for the typically\npoorer farmers on settlement schemes, since agroforestry\nand similar activities have traditionally been considered\n\u2018unproductive\u2019 due to their innovative and sometimes\nuncertain nature. They have a longer-term time horizon\nin which income flows can be unpredictable compared\nwith normal farming systems. This induces extreme\ncaution on the part of local bank officials, who tend to\nhave little knowledge of these areas. It takes several years,\nfor example, for planted trees to yield an income from\nfruit or timber sales, unlike with cattle or conventional\nfood crops.13\n\u2018Environmentally friendly\u2019 credit lines have recently\nbeen introduced within PRONAF, but these are\nalso unsuitable for most Proambiente activities.\nFor example, 84% of \u2018PRONAF-Forests\u2019 funding is\nallocated to larger-scale reforestation schemes for\nEucalyptus rather than agroforestry projects.\n\u2018PRONAF-Agroecology\u2019 requires detailed feasibility\nstudies and is not suitable for small farmers in the\nabsence of such technical assistance. \u2018PRONAF-ECO\u2019\nis for water and energy projects, also granted on the basis\nof prior technical studies. Thus, one of the demands\nfrom extension workers and farmers involved in\nProambiente is that MDA\/PRONAF policies should be\nrealigned with changing needs, a proposal that meets\nwith significant internal resistance in the ministry itself.\nAnother related issue concerns the provision of\nagricultural extension support to Proambiente farmers.\nThis is sub-contracted on an annual basis by the MDA\nto local non-governmental organizations. However,\ndelays of several months in contract renewals have led\nto a lack of continuity in service provision, often at key\npoints in the agricultural calendar, generating consider-\nable frustration among NGOs and farmers. This has\nled to high rates of staff turnover (MMA 2004).\nFurthermore, state government extension services are\nrarely attuned to the Proambiente ethos and collabor-\nation with their NGO counterparts seems to be an\nexception rather than the rule. In 2006, the MDA\nlaunched a new National Programme for Technical\nAssistance and Rural Extension (PRONATER), whichPhil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2008)aims to foster greater collaboration among federal, state\nand non-governmental extension services in support of\nsmall farmers generally, including those participating\nin Proambiente (MDA 2006, 2007).\nPolitical bias in the identification of Proambiente\n\u2018poles\u2019 has also been raised as a problem that may have\ncreated obstacles to project implementation. Born of\ngrassroots social movements and taken over by the PT\ngovernment, a preference for areas characterized by\ntraditions of rural trade unionism has been evident.\nWhile positive from a mobilization standpoint, this\ncould distort the process by leading to the exclusion\nfrom Proambiente of organized but non-unionized\ncommunities. Furthermore, a unionized community\ndoes not necessarily have the organizational attributes\nor the social capital necessary to become successfully\ninvolved in a PES scheme. This is a key issue in the case\nof Proambiente, in which \u2018community agreements\u2019 form\nthe basis for negotiating and mapping individual and\ngroup sustainable practices. Without a degree of group\nsolidarity to ensure successful implementation, the\nultimate objectives of certification and payments may\nbe undermined.\nSeen in more strategic terms, Proambiente was\noriginally conceived as part of a longer-term process of\nterritorial development in the Amazon in which support\nfor small-scale farming would be integrated with other\nmeasures. Fears have been expressed that the failure to\npursue such a coordinated approach with due prior\nattention being given to organizational and management\ncapacity will frustrate the government\u2019s efforts to\npromote sustainable rural development adapted to\nregional conditions (MMA 2004; MDA 2005). Thus,\nthe need for greater collaboration between the ministries\nof environment and agrarian development in the\nexecution of Proambiente is evident.5. CONCLUSION: BETTER RED THAN DEAD\nProambiente is Brazil\u2019s incipient attempt to provide a\nsystem of PES rendered by small producers who are\nhelping to conserve the Amazon rainforest by adopting\nmore sustainable farming systems, including agrofor-\nestry, extractivism, forest and pasture management,\namong others. The need to provide compensation for\nRED is being debated under the UNFCCC following\npressure from developing countries for avoided defor-\nestation to be included as a valid criterion for carbon\noffsets under the CDM of the Kyoto Protocol after\n2012. Such trading has already taken place in a small\nway through informal carbon markets (Bayon et al.\n2006). Indeed, this path is being taken by the state of\nAmazonas, as noted above. Many people believe that\nfurther funding could be released, either through the\nmarket or via donor trust funds. The World Bank, for\nexample, has set up a US$300 million FCPF to pilot\nRED schemes. Such initiatives could benefit thousands\nof poor family farmers in Amazonia and, indeed, the\ntropics generally, who depend for their livelihoods on\nnatural resources but who struggle to make ends meet.\nAfter just 4 years in operation and having achieved\nmodest success, Proambiente has demonstrated pitfalls\nthat threaten to frustrate the realization of this\npotential. As noted above, these include funding\n1930 A.

As such,\nProambiente has been labelled as a \u2018PES-like\u2019scheme that,\nin common with many other similar programmes, does\nnot fulfil all the strict criteria involved in a formal PES\nexercise but which nevertheless has similar goals\n(Wunder 2006, p. 54).\nThere is another fundamental anomaly in terms of\npursuing environmental versus social objectives. To\nconserve the greatest area of forest, large landowners\nshould be targeted since in Amazonia at least they\noccupy most of the region and pose the most serious\nthreat to the environment overall through illegal logging,\ncattle ranching and other commercial activities.\nFurthermore, the transaction costs of dealing with a\nsmall number of larger owners would be relatively low.\nIn terms of social justice, however, smallholders and\nother poor resource users should be prioritized,\nalthough they are responsible for a relatively small\npercentage of deforestation and are expensive to reach.\nAt the same time, care has to be taken to protect\nthe rights of indigenous and traditional populations\n(Griffiths 2007). It has been argued that PES \u2018are best\nsuited to scenarios of moderate conservation opportu-\nnity costs on marginal lands and in settings with\nemerging, not realized threats\u2019 (Wunder 2006, p. 48).\nYet in spite of widespread support among NGOs for\nPES generally, some members of the academic and\nscientific community in Brazil oppose it on the grounds\nthat such funds are likely to be monopolized by large-\nscale farmers and small producers would be excluded\n(ESP 2007). Care would have to be taken to ensure that\nsupport is directed to those areas characterized by\non-going tension over access to land and natural\nresources, which places serious pressure on the forest.\nThere is much potential for targeting small farmers in\nprecarious situations who could benefit from PES and be\npersuaded to modify their activities. One significant\ncategory involves land reform beneficiaries, whose\nsettlement projects currently occupy 8% of Amazonia,\nbut where the level of deforestation is four times the\nregional average. This is due to the fact that small\nfarmers, lacking alternative, viable modelsorgovernment\nsupport, continue with slash-and-burn agriculture and\npasture formation as their major livelihood strategies\n(Epoca 2007).\nYet many small producers, including the bulk of\nthose participating in Proambiente, while not exactly\nliving in harmony with nature, are predisposed in some\nmeasure towards adopting more diversified, sustain-\nable production systems if given the opportunity. They\ntend to appreciate the environmental and personal\nbenefits that accrue, for example, to switching from\nslash-and-burn farming to agroforestry and extractive\nsystems. They also understand that in the longer-term,\nthe economic returns to perennials can be substantiallyPhil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2008)larger than for traditional subsistence crops such as\nrice, beans and cassava. However, given the initial\nopportunity costs of setting up diversified farming\nsystems, support is often needed to bridge the gap in\nconstructing a new livelihood while these activities\ncome on stream over a period of several years.\nThrough schemes such as Proambiente and other (non-\ncarbon related) programmes that combat poverty and\ndeforestation, the small farmers of Amazonia have shown\nthat there are viable alternatives to the destructive\npractices that currently cause high rates of forest loss.14\nHowever, adapting this potential specifically to reducing\nGHG emissions and scaling up to regional level will\nrequire much greater political commitment as well as the\nappropriate allocation of financial and human resources.\nAdditional funding targeted at key groups of environ-\nmental custodians to support PES could serve to\nstrengthen environmental policy and complement more\ntraditional conservation measures. This is especially true\nfor those producers living close to the economic margin\nwhose behaviour could be modified through the\nprovision of economic incentives and appropriate\ntechnical support.\nPayments schemes such as Proambiente could\neventually contribute significantly towards averting\nglobal warming, as long as this potential can be\neffectively harnessed. The possible integration in due\ncourse of Proambiente and other local\u2013national PES\ninitiatives into an international programme for promot-\ning RED perhaps offers some cautious optimism for the\nfuture. Such a stance does not of course negate the\npotential problems of governance and management\nassociated with such an ambitious global initiative,\nespecially as far as Brazilian Amazonia is concerned and\nthe sensitive political issues are involved. On balance,\nhowever, using PES to promote reduced emissions\nfrom deforestation could help avert the potentially fatal\nconsequences of current development patterns in\nAmazonia upon both the environment and on people\u2019s\nlivelihoods. In spite of the many challenges which must\nbe faced, therefore, it is far better to be RED than dead.\nThanks are due to three reviewers who provided valuable\ncomments on an earlier draft of this paper.ENDNOTES\n1Fieldwork on Proambiente was carried out by the author in August\n2007. Several project sites were visited in Tocantins and Acre, where\ninterviews were conducted with farmers, local NGOs and state\ngovernment officials. The author would like to express his gratitude to\nstaff at Brazil\u2019s Ministries of the Environment and Agrarian\nDevelopment for their valuable assistance, as well as to Proambiente\nproject staff and beneficiaries interviewed during fieldwork. Special\nthanks are due to Shigeo Shiki, Hurben Corre\u02c6a da Silva and Brent\nMillikan for their support.\n2Although IBAMA refuses to publish figures on payment of fines, it is\ngenerally thought to be around 3\u20135%. The state government of Mato\nGrosso, for example, has made it known that just 2% of its\nenvironmental fines are collected (ISA 2006).\n3From 1971 to 1987 alone, for example, over US$5 billion in tax\nincentives and subsidized credit was allocated to cattle ranching in the\nAmazon (Schneider 1992). Although new incentives were suspended\nin 1991, already existing tax breaks as well as subsidized credit have\ncontinued (Fearnside 2000). From 1989 to 2002 the Bank of\nAmazonia lent US$5.8 billion to cattle ranchers in the region at\nsubsidized rates (Arima et al. 2005).\nPayments for environmental services A.

In December 2005, the UNFCCC Parties agreed\nto consider the issue of RED (compensation for avoided deforesta-\ntion) with a view to formulating recommendations to be discussed at\nthe next Convention of the Parties (COP-13) held in December 2007\nin Bali, Indonesia.\n5The Nova Gerar landfill gas scheme in Rio de Janeiro was the first\nproject officially registered under the CDM. A small number of\nforestry projects based on reforestation of degraded areas have been\nundertaken in Minas Gerais (Plantar and Peugeot) and Mato Grosso\n(Bananal Island). See May et al. (2003) and Grieg-Gran et al. (2005).\nThe Botica\u00b4rio Foundation has also announced plans to pay $12\nmillion over 10 years to landowners who preserve the Atlantic\nRainforest at the headwaters of Greater Sa\u02dco Paulo\u2019s rivers\n(Nascimento Madureira 2006). This is comparable with schemes\nintroduced elsewhere such as Colombia.\n6This process was initiated by rural trade union federations and major\nNGOs, such as IPAM and FASE, with financial support from the\nMinistry of the Environment, the State University of New York\n(SUNY) and the Ford Foundation.\n7Namely, Para\u00b4, Tocantins, Acre, Mato Grosso, Amapa\u00b4, Roraima,\nAmazonas and Maranha\u02dco.\n8Lei de Mudanc\u00b8as Clima\u00b4ticas e Conservac\u00b8a\u02dco Ambiental.\n9In addition to Amazonas, the states of Acre and Parana\u00b4 are\nconsidering setting up state-led PES systems.\n10Projeto de Lei 792 (2007) introduced by Deputy Anselmo de Jesus\n(PT-Roraima) and Projeto de Lei 1190 (2007) authored by Deputy\nAntonio Palocci (PT-Sa\u02dco Paulo).\n11The preliminary text of this third bill was discussed at the third\nmeeting of the Proambiente Governing Council on 28\u201329 August 2007.\nIt will probably be appended to the other two bills for the passage\nthrough Congress. Possible funding sources include fuel taxes (CIDE),\nthe petrol and environment compensation fund, the EcologicalVAT, the\nNational Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES),\nregional development funds (FCO and FNO), as well external funding\nfrom aid and private sources (Arruda et al. 2007).\n12Observations in this section are based on interviews with staff at the\nMinistry of Agrarian Development, Brasilia, and conversations with\nProambiente staff in the field, August 2007.\n13For example, one of the most popular agroforestry crops is cupuac\u00b8u\n(Theobroma grandiflorum), which requires 4\u20135 years to yield a viable first\nharvest. For valuable hardwoods such as mahogany, this period is\nmeasured in decades rather than years.\n14Other programmes include: the G7 Pilot Programme to Conserve the\nBrazilian Rainforest, the Plan to Combat Amazonian Deforestation, the\nNational Pact for the Valorization of the Forest and the End of\nDeforestation in Amazonia and the 2-year moratorium agreed between\nNGOs and major agribusiness corporations on trading in soya bean\nproduced in newly deforested areas (Hall 2000; Greenpeace 2007).REFERENCES\nAmazonas 2007 Compromisso do Amazonas com seu povo e com o\nplaneta.
