In-depth interviews were analysed using the iterative thematic analysis\ndescribed by Lieblich. Findings: Living with cancer can be an exhausting process.\nMaintaining continuity of everyday life was the norm, and dependent on a dynamic\nprocess of balancing threats and supports to people\u2019s emotional well-being. Interac-\ntions with health care professionals were therapeutic when they provided emotional,\nor narrative, support. Threats arose when the patient\u2019s perception of the professional\u2019s\naccount of their illness experience was at odds with the person\u2019s own sense of their\ncore self and what was important to them. Our findings highlight the need for a\nframework in which clinicians may legitimately utilize different illness models to\ndeliver a personalized, patient-centred assessment of need and care. The work pro-\nvides testable hypotheses supporting development of understanding of therapeutic\nimpact of the consultation.\nKey words: doctor\u2013patient interactions; illness narratives; palliative care\nReceived: 28 April 2008; accepted: 6 March 2009; first published online 3 June 2009\nIntroduction\nFor many years, models of good primary medical\ncare have emphasized the importance of consulta-\ntion skills and continuing relationships (Chew-\nGraham, May and Ronald, 2004; WONCA Europe,\nCorrespondence to: Dr Joanne Reeve, Post at time of work:\nClinical Research Associate, Division of Primary Care, Uni-\nversity of Liverpool.

Effective communication skills support\naccurate identification of problems, increased\npatient satisfaction and concordance with treat-\nment (Maguire and Pitceathly, 2002). But the\nconsultation is more than a communication tool\nto aid therapy through the correct exchange of\ninformation. Patient-centeredness, the recogni-\ntion of and response to patient perspectives\nwithin clinical encounters, improves satisfaction\n(Kearley, Freeman and Heath, 2001; McLean and\nArmstrong, 2004) and concordance (Britten et al.,\n2000; Kearley, Freeman and Heath, 2001). The\nconsultation, including the relationship between\npatient and practitioner, is itself part of the\n\u2018therapy\u2019 (Hippocrates, 1923; Balint, 1955; Di\nBlasi et al., 2001).\nDespite the emphasis placed on the consultation\nwithin professional values, the evidence-base under-\npinning its use remains underdeveloped. Models of\ndoctor\u2013patient communication as a set of skills and\nbehaviours which can be objectively observed (Saba\net al., 2006) and hence taught and learned (Salmon\nand Young, 2005), have guided development of\ntraining programmes. Yet, Saba et al. (2006) warned\nthat whilst communication can \u2018look good\u2019 if\nassessed by whether doctors utilize these skills, it\nmay still not \u2018feel good\u2019 for either patient or doctor.\nA purely skills-focused model for understanding\nand teaching consultation skills may be inadequate\nto support good clinical care (Burkitt Wright,\nHolcombe and Salmon, 2004; Salmon and Young,\n2005; Saba et al., 2006). Patient-centeredness,\nalthough valued, is not evident in many everyday\nconsultations (Freeman, Car and Hill, 2004). The\nspecific impact of \u2018therapeutic relationships\u2019 on\npatient outcomes is still not known (Di Blasi\net al., 2001). The evidence-gap perhaps arises\nsince these core values and attitudes within clin-\nical disciplines are often the hardest to define in a\nway which can be measured (Howie et al., 2000).\nMuch research into health care interactions\nfocuses on studying processes within the con-\nsultation itself. However, a consultation is a par-\nticular social interaction which occurs within the\nwider context of people\u2019s lives; health services\nform part of the cultural context in which people\nexperience illness (Pierret, 2003). We increasingly\nrecognize the importance of learning about illness\nby listening to the stories of people who are\nexperiencing it (Greenhalgh and Hurwitz, 1998;\nLauner, 2002; Bingley et al., 2008; Thomas et al.,\n2008). These accounts have the potential to offer\ninsights into the nature and impact of interactions\nwith health care providers and settings.\nWe recently completed a study looking at the\ndisruptive impact of illness and associated distress\nthrough an analysis of the accounts told by people\nwith terminal cancer. A key finding was that most\npeople were able to successfully continue to live\ntheir everyday lives despite the significant threats\nposed by their cancer and other life events. The\nprocesses underpinning this self-management\n(Foster et al., 2007) of illness in the context of\neveryday life are summarized within the Self-\nIntegrity Model (SIM), illustrated in Figure 1\n(Reeve et al., 2009a). Continuity of daily life\n(biographical flow in Figure 1) was dependent on\nmanaging the impacts of potentially disruptive life\nevents, including terminal illness, on the \u2018core-self\u2019\n\u2013 defined as that which mattered most to people.\nThreats caused distress; including depressed mood,\nanxiety, frustration and tiredness. Maintaining\ncontinuity depended on mobilizing sufficient\nresources to balance the threats and resulting dis-\ntress. These included narrative support (creating\nand finding meaning in events) and emotional\nsupport (actions and circumstances which brought\ncomfort). Occasionally, supports were over-\nwhelmed; physical, mental and emotional exhaus-\ntion resulted in biographical fracture associated\nwith major depression (Figure 1).\nAlthough not a primary focus of the study,\npeople\u2019s accounts of living and dying with cancer\ncommonly included references to encounters with\nhealth care professionals, especially doctors.\nThese accounts offer valuable insights into the\nimpact of interactions with professionals as\nviewed from the context of people\u2019s everyday\nlives, rather than focusing on what occurs within\nthe consultation itself. The aim of this paper is,\ntherefore, to describe the impact of interactions\nas told by participants in this study, and to explore\nthe reasons for the observed effects.\nMethods\nOur sample consisted of 19 adult patients with\nterminal cancer living in Merseyside, UK, all of\nwhom were aware of their diagnosis. Purposive\nsampling (Silverman, 2000) selected patients from\nprimary care practices, considering age, sex, disease\n358 Joanne Reeve et al.\nPrimary Health Care Research & Development 2009; 10: 357\u2013367\ntype, socioeconomic group and risk status on\nthe Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) (Lloyd-\nWilliams, Friedman and Rudd, 2000). Table 1\nsummarises the participants.\nData collection was by semi-structured inter-\nview, exploring people\u2019s experiences before and\nsince cancer diagnosis. Most participants focused\non the time since their terminal diagnosis, thereby\ndescribing events that had happened in the pre-\nvious weeks and months. The interview schedule\nasked people how they were feeling and how that\nhad changed over time, prompting people to\nreflect on things that made them feel worse or\nbetter. There were no specific questions about\ninteractions with health professionals but, where\nappropriate, people were prompted to reflect on\nhow well others, including medical staff, under-\nstood the way they were feeling. All interviews\ntook place in individuals\u2019 own homes, lasting\n30\u2013150min. All were conducted by JR, who was\nintroduced to participants via the study informa-\ntion leaflet as a local general practitioner (GP)\ninterested in understanding people\u2019s experiences\nand feelings associated with their cancer. Interviews\nwere recorded and subsequently transcribed\nverbatim. In two cases, the recording equipment\nfailed; fieldnotes covering issues from the non-\nrecorded conversations were made within one\nhour of the end of the interview.\nAll authors contributed to the initial analysis\nand coding: to confirm that common areas of text\nwere being identified as important, and to discuss\nthe interpretation of emerging ideas. JR led the\ndetailed analysis of subsequent transcripts, pre-\nparing analysis reports, which were discussed\nregularly amongst all the authors to check inter-\nnal consistency and confirmability, and external\nrelevance to existing literature.\nWe adopted Marton\u2019s (1986) phenomeno-\ngraphic approach, which seeks to understand why\npeople experience phenomena differently; adap-\nted to include the holistic-form and holistic-\ncontent analytical methods described by Lieblich,\nTuval-Maschiach and Zilber (1998). Holistic-form\nanalysis considers the overall structure of illness\nnarrative, and was used to categorize accounts\ninto those with a continuous narrative thread\n(biographical flow, see Figure 1) and those with\nevidence of significant disruption (biographical\nfracture) (Reeve et al., 2009b).

Initial coding was supported by the use\nof NVIVO version 11; codes and quotes were\nthen imported into Excel spreadsheets, allowing\ncomparisons within and between biographical\ncategories. As key themes emerged from the data\n(see Box 1), summary accounts were constructed\nfor each participant describing the identified\ncontent for each sub-theme. Analysis of these\naccounts revealed encounters with health pro-\nfessionals as examples of both threats and bal-\nances. It is these encounters that we report in this\npaper. Further details of the analysis are available\nin Reeve (2006), and from the authors.\nThe processes of sampling, data collection and\nanalysis continued until the emerging analysis\ndemonstrated coherence: that the analytical\nmodel was adequate to explain the full range of\nthe data set identified, within the constraints of\nthe research question and theoretical perspectives\n(Radnitsky, 1968; Kvale, 1996). We used Max-\nwell\u2019s (2002) criteria for quality of knowledge\nproduction to assess the trustworthiness of our\nanalysis; including three criteria of methodologi-\ncal rigour (descriptive validity, interpretive\nvalidity and theoretical validity) and two of utility\n(generalizability and evaluative validity).\nTable 1 Showing participant characteristics\nReferencea Age range (years) Sex Tumourb EDSc score Lives alone Attends hospice\nAlbert 80s M Resp 6 N N\nRon 60s M Haemat 10 N N\nHelen 60s F GIT 16* Y N\nNora 60s F Resp 16* Y N\nMarjorie 60s F Resp 20* N Y\nJenny 70s F Resp 17* N Y\nMary$ 60s F Resp 18* Y N\nLinda 50s F Breast 17* N N\nPeter 60s M Urol 12 Y N\nJim 80s M GIT 12 Y N\nPat 60s F Resp 12 N N\nBob 40s M Resp 5 N N\nRuth 70s F GIT 7 Y N\nStuart 40s M Soft tissue ** N Y\nJoyce 80s F Breast ** N Y\nJohn 60s M Urol ** N Y\nAngela 40s F Gynae 6 N N\nMark 40s M Resp 16* N Y\nJoan 50s F Breast ** N Y\na Names given are pseudonyms.\nb GIT5gastrointestinal tract; Resp5 respiratory; Urol5urological; Haemat5haematological.\nc EDS5Edinburgh Depression Scale.\n*5high risk scores; **selected as high risk\/expressing distress by MLW.\n$ had confirmed ICD depression at time of interview.\nM5male, F5 female; N5no, Y5yes.\nBox 1 Key themes arising from the\niterative analysis\nTheme Sub themes\nCore self Being & doing\nCompetence\nFamily\nThreats Threats to:\nPhysical integrity\nPersonal integrity\nIntegrity of worldview\nResult of threats Emotional response\nReflective response\nBalances Emotional\nReflective\n360 Joanne Reeve et al.\nPrimary Health Care Research & Development 2009; 10: 357\u2013367\nThe case studies and quotations offered in this\naccount have been selected as the best means to\nillustrate the stated themes within the constraint\nof a publication.

We describe these effects\nbefore discussing the possible reasons for them,\ndrawing on the SIM described in Figure 1.\nTherapeutic interactions: narrative and\nempathy\nRelationships were identified as a significant\nsource of support, providing opportunities for\npeople to talk and reflect, as well as emotional\ncomfort.\nIllness and dying posed significant threats to\npeople\u2019s sense of who they were, and the nature\nof the world around them. Existential reflections\non questions such as \u2018why me?\u2019 (Helen), or \u2018why\nnot someone else,\u2019 were common.\nJim: Well the only simple way I can describe\n[it is] to say, I look at somebody that I know\nis not of the best, and I say, well, why did it\nhave to happen to me?\nMany sought meaning based on their pre-existing\nassumptions and values and their faith; occa-\nsionally doctors provided an alternative account\nor narrative support (Box 2).\nAccounts revealed the importance of these\nbeing \u2018shared narratives\u2019: a shared experience\nwith health care professionals that went beyond a\nnarrative (cognitive) construction of events to\ninclude a non-cognitive (emotional) form of\nsupport. People described the emotional support\nfrom contact with health care professionals in\nterms of being made to feel cared for, or special,\ngaining a sense of warmth or trust (Box 3).\nNon-therapeutic (noxious) interactions:\nincongruent accounts\nOther interactions were less supportive, the\neffect being more than simply dissatisfaction with\na \u2018sub-optimal\u2019 service, but revealing a noxious\nimpact on people\u2019s efforts to maintain bio-\ngraphical flow.\nPeter was a 62-year-old man with metastatic\nprostate cancer, who lived alone and whose entire\ninterview-narrative was underpinned by his account\nof being a fell-walker. Although no longer able to\npartake in the sport, his sense of \u2018being\u2019 a fell-walker,\nand of having that recognized, was a crucial\nBox 2 Explanation and meaning identi-\nfied within interactions with health pro-\nfessionals\nJenny: \u2018I\u2019ll tell you what does worry me.

She] turned round and said,\n\u2018\u2018You\u2019ve been referred to me because\napparently you\u2019ve been depressed.\u2019\u2019 \u2019 JR: \u2018Did\nyou agree?

Peter described\na conversation, which took place with his oncol-\nogist where he had described his delight at his\nimproved mobility following the start of his\nZomitor injections.\nPeter: I mentioned to [my doctor] that I had\nwalked down to [place]. \u2018Yes I know you\nwere a fit man,\u2019 he said, \u2018but unfortunately\nwhat you have likes bones.\u2019 Do you know\nDr X? He was coldy He didn\u2019t seem con-\ncerned about what I want to do or what I\nhad done. He just [gestures] out of the way,\nthat\u2019s gone.\nPeter was clearly distressed by his doctor\u2019s\nresponse; distress, which persisted until he died.\nThere was no indication of an unrealistic percep-\ntion that Peter thought he might fell-run again;\nonly a desire to be recognized as a fell-runner and\nhave others value his achievement. His physician\u2019s\nfocus was only on the physical impact of the dis-\nease. It is this incongruence in perspective that was\nrevealed as the cause for Peter\u2019s distress.\nAnother participant, Joyce, spoke of the delay\nin diagnosing her with spinal cord compression\nfrom metastatic disease. However, she was not\nconcerned with the threat to her physical health\nfrom the delayed diagnosis. Instead, she described\nher dismay at her doctor\u2019s failure to acknowledge\nher as a competent and active woman, by\nacknowledging that her symptoms were sig-\nnificant because they were unusual for her.\nJoyce: I saw three doctors four times. And by\nthe last time I saw them, I could hardly\nwalkyMy own doctor let me down terribly I\nthink. When he knows I was a fit womany I\nwalked in on [my husband\u2019s arm] and a stick.\nSurely to God he could have seen there was\nsomething radically wrong there. When I went\nin I didn\u2019t sit down, I fell downy But it\nrankles with me terribly. It hurts me terribly.\nOther examples of threats were perhaps less\nstark, but nonetheless evident. Ruth visited her GP\nshortly after she had been told she had metastatic\ndisease. She felt she was managing well, but was\nsurprised when her GP offered her antidepressants.\nShe describes a sense of anxiety from her percep-\ntion of a mismatch in assessed need.\nRuth: Yes, [my GP] really was keen on the\nantidepressants. Maybe he\u2019d had experience\nwith people with cancer who had gone really\ndown in the dumps and he was doing his best\nto sort of bring them back up to a bit of\nhappinessyJR: Were you surprised when he\nasked you [whether you needed antidepres-\nsants]? Ruth: Yes, I was actually. Because I\ndidn\u2019t think I looked depressed. I may have\nBox 3 Emotional support from doctor\u2013\npatient interactions\nMary: \u2018It does help to talk about it with\nsomebody like you [to JR]. I\u2019m a firm believer\nin talking to your doctors and counsellorsy\nBecause it, you feel so alone, with cancer.\u2019\nHelen: \u2018It\u2019s very important to know that\nsomeone that\u2019s in there is interested in mey\nAnd [my surgeon] \u2013 he\u2019s absolutely wonderful\nthat man. He\u2019s brilliant. When he sees you, his\nface lights up. And he goes, \u2018\u2018I can\u2019t get over\nyou. You look so well. You look wonderful.\u2019\u2019 \u2019\nJenny: \u2018There\u2019s just something about [the\nhospice] that makes you feel greaty They\u2019ve\ngot a nice attitudey[They\u2019re] so caringyYou\ndon\u2019t want sympathy, you want a bit of\nunderstanding. Sympathy makes you more\nupset and cry. But a little bit of understanding\ngoes a long way.\u2019\nJim: \u2018I must say it\u2019s quite a relaxed clinic with\nDr X. There seem to be two nurse\npractitionersyand they have established shall\nI say a sort of personal contact with you. And\nthey\u2019re both experienced young ladies and\nthey really do take care of you. It makes a\nworld of difference, makes a world of\ndifference.\u2019\nRuth: \u2018In the [chest hospital] I didn\u2019t find that\nyou got any different treatment because you\nhad canceryYou were just another body\nthere. There wasn\u2019t that warmth there. But in\n[the oncology hospital] oh, the care is\nwonderful. The attitude of people towards\nyou. Not sympathy or namby-pamby\ntreatment. But just so nice. You feel like a\nVIP actuallyy And you were just so special\nto them. You felt you were the only one there\nthat had cancer.\u2019\n362 Joanne Reeve et al.\nPrimary Health Care Research & Development 2009; 10: 357\u2013367\nlooked worried though, possibly. Because\noften people say to me, \u2018It may never happen.\u2019\nYou know. But that\u2019s my normal look. And\nmaybe that\u2019s how I looked to him. I don\u2019t\nknow. But I was surprised at the depression\nand I came home a few times from there\nthinking, \u2018I\u2019m not depressed.\u2019 And I was tell-\ning myself, you know I must look really mis-\nerable when I go. And I always made sure\nthen that I smiled when I went in! [laughs] I\nalways, as soon as I saw him I\u2019d give him a\nbig smile!\nAlthough more surprised than distressed by her\ndoctors\u2019 repsonse, the disruptive effect is evident\nin Ruth\u2019s ongoing reflections on the interaction,\nsuggesting a continuing need for reassurance that\nit was her doctor, and not herself, who had mis-\ninterpreted the situation.\nMary did not describe a problematic consultation\nwith her doctor. Her experiences instead revealed a\npotential threat, which might arise from the mis-\nmatch between a biomedical and personal assess-\nment of experience and need. Mary was the only\nparticipant who met ICD-10 criteria for depression\n(World Health Organization, 1992) on the day of\nher interview, as assessed using the revised Clinical\nInterview Schedule (Lewis et al., 1992) immediately\nafterwards. Yet she described herself as a strong\nwoman who had successfully dealt with a lifetime of\ndifficult situations. Whilst she was managing to cope\nwith her illness (lung cancer), she described it as a\ndifficult and draining process. When asked how she\ndealt with the way she was feeling, she replied:\nMary: I accept [the way I feel] and I try to\nfind an answer for myself. And deal with\nity I ask myself questions and if the answer\nis not what I\u2019m looking for then it just brings\non a little bit of depression doesn\u2019t it?.. It\u2019s\nnot depression. It\u2019s a quiet mode of deep\nthinking.\nIn contrast to the biomedical perspective, Mary\nviewed depression as part of \u2018coping,\u2019 and there-\nfore an integral part of her core-self.\nDiscussion\nCurrent research and clinical guidelines are con-\ncerned with the reported under detection and\ntreatment of depression in the terminally ill;\nresulting in a call for proactive screening and\npharmacological intervention (Wilson et al., 2000;\nStiefel et al., 2001; Potash and Breitbart, 2002).\nGuidance would highlight the need for Mary to\nbe informed of her diagnosis and recommended\ntreatment. Yet, we know that Ruth described\nbeing both surprised and slightly anxious when\noffered an unexpected diagnosis of depression.\nWe can speculate as to what the impact might\nhave been on Mary had someone told her she was\nsuffering from a disease, depression. Such a\ndiagnosis would have been incongruent with her\nmore productive (Gut, 1989) account of her\ndepression, which supported her sense of herself\n(her core-self) as a strong and competent woman.\nA pathological diagnosis could have threatened\nthis sense of self, leading to noxious, rather than\nthe intended therapeutic, effects. We know that\nPeter experienced significant distress when his\ndoctor\u2019s disease-focused account conflicted with\nPeter\u2019s own sense of who he was and what was\nimportant to him. Our analysis raises concerns\nabout the potential for a similarly negative impact\non Mary.\nThe SIM offers a framework by which the\nobserved effects of interactions with doctors may\nbe explained in terms of their impact on the\nperson\u2019s core-self (what matters most to them)\nand their efforts to continue to live their life,\nmaintaining biographical flow. We have described\nexamples of both positive and negative impacts\narising from interactions with doctors. Therapeutic\neffects came from narrative support: offering\nexplanations, opportunities to talk (Leventhal,\nNerenz and Steele, 1984), and perhaps supporting\nthe maintenance or restoration of narrative as\ndescribed by Greenhalgh and Hurwitz (1998),\nMattingley (1998), Launer (2002) and others. But\nparticipants also described the value of emotional\nsupport through empathy, reassurance and\nwarmth. This emphasis on emotional experiences\nof illness, rather than just a narrative account of\nfinding meaning, resonates with models of clinical\npractice which emphasize the importance of the\nrelationship between patient and practitioner\n(Orlinsky, Grawe and Parks, 1994; Mercer\nand Reynolds, 2002; Burkitt Wright, Holcombe\nand Salmon, 2004). Both cognitive\/narrative, and\nemotional aspects of care are valued by patients\n(Di Blasi et al., 2001).\nImpact of clinical encounters 363\nPrimary Health Care Research & Development 2009; 10: 357\u2013367\nNoxious effects were observed, arising when\nthere was incongruence between the patient\u2019s\nperception of the professional\u2019s account of illness\nand their own internal sense of themselves. May\net al. (2004) have previously highlighted concerns\nabout incongruence between doctors\u2019 and\npatients\u2019 accounts of sickness, arguing that future\ndevelopment of successful models of primary care\ncommunication and practice must tackle the dif-\nferences in biomedical and lay approaches to\nunderstanding illness experience. Our findings\nsuggest the need to look not only at differences in\nconceptual understanding of the illness itself, but\nto look more widely at how professional accounts\nsupport or undermine an individual\u2019s sense of\nthemselves and the world, and hence their efforts\nto continue living their everyday lives, maintain-\ning biographical flow.\nHarrison, Moran and Wood (2002) have argued\nthat current models of quality in clinical practice\nemphasize the use of objective, externally vali-\ndated accounts of disease. This so-called scienti-\nfic\u2013bureaucratic model of medical care promotes\nthe use of rigorously developed diagnostic tools,\nand guidelines or protocols of care in order to\ndeliver the best quality of care to patients. Models\nof quality of care value scientific knowledge\nabove other accounts given its origins in a scien-\ntific epistemology (Seale and Pattison, 1994). The\nmodel of doctor\u2013patient interaction promoted by\nthis approach mirrors that of the \u2018mining\u2019 meta-\nphor seen in qualitative research methodology\n(Kvale, 1996). The doctor\u2019s task is regarded as\nbeing to interpret the patient\u2019s story to reveal the\npresence or absence of objective disease, and thus\ninstigate protocols of care.\nYet illness is recognized to be more than the\npresence or absence of disease. Other models of\ncare exist, including that of narrative medicine\n(Greenhalgh and Hurwitz, 1998; Mattingley, 1998;\nLauner, 2002) and the patient-centred, biopsycho-\nsocial model of clinical practice (Borrell-Carrio,\nSuchman and Epstein, 2004). Whilst valued\nwithin the profession, at least at a rhetorical level\n(Dowrick et al., 1996; Checkland et al., 2008), these\nalternative accounts are not reflected in current\nmeasures of quality of practice. Indeed, there is\nevidence that the emphasis on scientific\u2013bureau-\ncratic medicine is moving practice further towards\na disease-centred, rather than a person-centred,\nfocus of care (Checkland et al., 2008).\nOur study provides evidence raising concerns that\nfailure to adequately acknowledge the individual\nwithin the interaction, that is the consultation, could\nresult not just in \u2018consumer dissatisfaction,\u2019 but in\na harmful effect resulting from the threat to an\nindividual\u2019s core sense of what matters to them. It\nhighlights the importance of viewing the consulta-\ntion as more than a technical process of identifying\na \u2018true\u2019 diagnosis, but a social interaction with\npotential consequences for the individual beyond\nthe identification and selection of an evidence-\nbased intervention.\nStudy limitations\nAlthough our study met Maxwell\u2019s (2002) quality\ncriteria for methodological rigour (Reeve, 2006),\nthis was a small study using a deliberately select\nsample. Generalizability of our findings, therefore,\nstems from our contribution to development of\ntheory (Doucet and Mauthner, 2002). Yet, it could\nbe questioned whether we have offered anything\nnew over and above, for example, the importance of\npersonal meaning described in the narrative medi-\ncine literature (Greenhalgh and Hurwitz, 1998;\nMattingley, 1998; Launer, 2002). We suggest that\nour findings also emphasize the emotional effects of\ninteractions and the need to understand their\nimpact on an embodied, emotional self (Williams\nand Bendelow, 1996). In addition, whilst the nar-\nrative literature focuses on the consultation itself,\nour work highlights the need to understand the\nconsultation as one element in a broader social\nsetting.\nGiven the interest in doctor\u2013patient interac-\ntions, the impact of using a GP interviewer on\nwhat and how experience was reported must be\nconsidered. Yet people spontaneously revealed\nexamples of both positive and negative interac-\ntions, with no evidence of inhibition in doing so.\nSome participants did not appear to consciously\nacknowledge JR as a GP. Indeed, although Mary\ninitially described finding it easier to talk to JR\nbecause she was a doctor, she subsequently\nreferred to JR as \u2018sweetheart,\u2019 described speaking\nto her \u2018woman to woman,\u2019 and described speaking\nto her \u2018not as a doctor now, but as a friend.\u2019\nPerhaps the most significant limitation comes in\nknowing whether the findings can contribute to\nmeaningful change in practice. We need further\nempirical testing of the ideas emerging from this\n364 Joanne Reeve et al.\nPrimary Health Care Research & Development 2009; 10: 357\u2013367\nstudy to establish their validity, and especially\nutility, in the care of patients.\nFuture research\nThe emotional and narrative impacts of the\nconsultation, including the impact of conceptual\nmodels of illness, may have important effects\non outcomes. The SIM may offer a theoretical\nframework within which to explain, and further\ndevelop understanding of, the therapeutic and\nnon-therapeutic nature of doctor\u2013patient inter-\nactions. We propose that the consultation be\nviewed as a complex-intervention (Campbell\net al., 2007), and that future research focus on the\nnature and impact of this \u2018therapeutic tool\u2019 in\nsupporting living with illness, including bio-\ngraphical flow and self-management (Foster et al.,\n2007) of daily life.\nOur findings highlight the importance of the\npractitioner\u2013patient encounter as an important\narea for future research within palliative and\nsupportive care. Research questions arising\ninclude whether congruence between doctor and\npatients\u2019 conceptual models promotes therapeutic\ninteractions; this could be tested by detailed\nqualitative studies of consultations utilizing the\ntape-assisted recall approach (Elliott and Shapiro,\n1988). Educational approaches using reflective\nlearning (Al Sheri, 1995) could be used to assess\nclinicians\u2019 conceptual models for understanding\npatient illness experience and their impact on\nconsultations, and hence the self-management of\nillness experience as part of on-going daily life.\nOur findings suggest the need for a framework in\nwhich clinicians may legitimately utilize different\nillness models to deliver a personalized, patient-\ncentred assessment of need and care. Whilst further\nexploratory work would strengthen the ideas pre-\nsented in this paper, we propose this should focus\non developing models of care which support both\npatient and practitioner in the process of co-\nconstructing an individualized account of illness:\none that supports, but certainly doesn\u2019t undermine,\nindividuals\u2019 on-going efforts to live their lives.\nAcknowledgements\nJoanne Reeve was funded by a Primary Care\nResearcher Development Award from the National\nCoordinating Centre for Research Capacity\nDevelopment (Department of Health, UK).\nReferences\nAl Sheri, A. 1995: Learning by reflection in general practice:\na study report.
