The  composites  were  characterized  using  UV-visible  and  Raman\nspectroscopy, zeta-potential measurements, cyclic voltammetry (CV) coupled with a photoreactor,\nscanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)  coupled  with\nenergy  dispersive  x-ray  spectroscopy  (EDX).  The  photocatalytic  activity   of   TiO2   and   the\nTiO2\/SWNT composite was investigated using the photo-oxidation of methanol in sulfuric acid as\nsupporting  electrolyte.  The  results  indicate   that   the   TiO2\/SWNT   composite   enhances   the\nphotocatalytic  activity  compared  to  TiO2  alone.  Electrochemical  studies  of  the   TiO2\/SWNT\ncomposite were also carried out in various supporting  electrolytes  and  the  presence  of  SWNTs\nwas shown to increase the current achieved in voltammetric measurements.\nKeywords; titanium dioxide, carbon nanotube, composite, photocatalytic\nIntroduction\nTiO2 photocatalytic particles have been widely  studied  due  to  their  application  in  the  field  of\nphotocatalytic oxidation under  UV  illumination  [1-5].  The  properties  of  TiO2  which  make  it\nuseful in this application include its strong oxidizing power [5-7]  and  its  physical  and  chemical\nstability [7-8]. The photocatalytic properties of TiO2 can be generated with  UV  illumination  due\nto the band gap energy (3.2 eV) of anatase TiO2 [7, 9]. TiO2  nanoparticles  prepared  by  different\nmethods have shown different photocatalytic efficiencies, due to variations in particle  size,  phase\ncomposition, surface area,  pore  volume,  pore  distribution,  band  gap  energy,  crystallinity  and\nthermal stability [9-13].\nDue to  their  unique  properties,  including  high  surface  area,  high  electrical  conductivity  and\nsignificant mechanical strength [11, 14-15], integrating carbon nanotubes with TiO2  nanoparticles\nshould  result  in  changes  in  morphology   and   enhanced   properties   (in   particular   electrical\nconductivity)  of  TiO2  [15-16].  Therefore,  this   study   aims   to   elucidate   the   properties   of\nTiO2\/SWNT composites for the application of the degradation of an organic molecule.\nIn this work, we present the preparation and characterization of a TiO2\/SWNT composite,  and  its\npreliminary study on methanol degradation in aqueous solution.\nMaterials\nTiO2 nanoparticles with an average size of 20 nm  were  synthesized  using  the  sol-gel  technique\naccording to Natda et al.  [17].  Single  wall  carbon  nanotubes  (Carbon  Nanotechnologies,  Inc.,\nHouston), methanol (MeOH, Univar, Ajax), ethanol (EtOH, Univar, Ajax), sulfuric  acid  (H2SO4,\nUnivar, Ajax), dichloromethane (DCM, Univar,  Ajax),  sodium  nitrate  (NaNO3,  Univar,  Ajax),\npotassium  ferrocyanide  (K4Fe(CN)6,   Univar,   Ajax),   sodium   dodecyl   sulfate   (SDS,   BDH\nchemical), 2,4-pentanedione (Aldrich) and acetone (Univar, Ajax) were used as received.\nIndium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass was purchased  from  Delta  Technologies  Ltd.  (USA).   The\nITO glass was washed with acetone overnight and treated in an UVO-cleaner (Model No.  42-220,\nJelight Co. Inc., USA) for 30 minutes before use.\nExperimental\nElectrochemical  testing  of  the  TiO2\/SWNT  composite  electrode  was  performed  by  using  an\nelectrochemical hardware system comprising of an EG&G  PAR  363  Potentiostat\/Galvanostat,  a\nBioanalytical System CV27 Voltammograph, a MacLab 400 with Chart v.  3.5.7\/EChem  v.  1.3.2\nsoftware (AD Instruments). All electrochemical experiments were performed at room temperature\nin a three-electrode cell. The modified ITO glass was used as the  working  electrode  coated  with\nTiO2, SWNTs or  the  TiO2\/SWNT  composite  via  screen  printing.  An  Ag\/AgCl  electrode  and\ncleaned platinum mesh were used as the reference and the auxiliary electrode, respectively.\nThe photocatalytic activity was  investigated  in  a  commercial  photochemical  reactor  (Rayonet,\nSouthern New England Ultraviolet Company, USA). Irradiations were carried out with  ultraviolet\nlamps, RPR-3000 \u00c5 lamps (Branford, USA) and RPR-3500 \u00c5  lamps  (Branford,  USA)  with  the\nlight intensity about 10 Wm-2 monitored  using  a  LI-250  light  meter  (Model  Pyranometer,  LI-\nCOR\u00ae, Biosciences, USA).\nUV-visible spectra of the samples  were  examined  over  the  range  of  300-1100  nm  (Shimadzu\nUV1601 spectrophotometer). The zeta-potential of all dispersions was measured using a  Zetasizer\nNano 3600 (Malvern instruments). The surface morphology  of  the  composite  was  studied  with\nscanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM)  using  a  LeicaStereo  SS440   microscope.   Transmission\nelectron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed using a Philips CM200 microscope (200 kV),\nequipped with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDAX\u00ae  DX-4 EDX  system)  with  30mm2\nactive area (Detector Crystal).\nPhotoanode fabrication\nA TiO2 paste was prepared  by  adding  0.25  ml  2,4-pentanedione  (10  wt%  in  H2O)  and  1  ml\ndeionized water to 3 g TiO2 and the mixture was ground in a mortar for 15 min. This was repeated\n3 times while adding 0.25 ml 2,4-pentanedione (10 wt% in H2O) and 1  ml  deionized  water  each\ntime. 5 (l Triton X-100 was added into  the  paste  to  enhance  film  formation  and  ground  for  a\nfurther  5  min.  The  TiO2  paste  was  screen  printed  onto  a  clean  ITO  substrate,  followed  by\nannealing at 150oC and 450oC for an hour  at  each  temperature.   The  thickness  of  the  resulting\nmaterial is approximately 1.5 \u00b5m.\nThe TiO2\/SWNT composite was prepared by mixing 50 mg TiO2 powder with 0.4 mg SWNTs and\n 40 mg of an aqueous SDS solution (1% w\/v), in 10 ml  ethanol  and  sonicating  (Branson  Digital\nSonifier) for an hour (sonication pulse; on 2 second, off 1 second,  with  amplitude  of  30%).  The\ncomposite powder was obtained via centrifugation, and then dried  in  the  oven  at  200  \u00b0C  for  1\nhour. The preparation of the composite paste used the  same  protocol  as  described  for  the  TiO2\npaste, and the paste was screen printed onto an ITO substrate and annealed in the same way as  the\nTiO2 paste. The thickness of the resulting material is approximately 12 \u00b5m.\nResults and Discussion\nCharacterization of TiO2\/SWNT composite\nThe  UV-visible  spectra  of  TiO2,  SWNTs  and  TiO2\/SWNT  films  are  shown  in  Fig.  1.   The\nabsorbance of TiO2 occurred below 350 nm, whereas the broad absorption peaks for SWNTs were\nobserved between 450-1000 nm. In the spectrum of the TiO2\/SWNT  composite,  the  presence  of\nthe TiO2 band below 400 nm was observed, as well as  a  broad  spectrum  between  450-1000  nm\nfrom the SWNTs.\nZeta-potential  measurements  were  used  in  order  to  identify  the  stability  and  charge  of   the\ndispersions used (Table 1). The TiO2 was found to be positively charged with a value greater  than\n+30 mV, which indicates a stable suspension.  The  SWNT\/SDS  dispersion  was  observed  to  be\nnegatively charged due  to  the  anionic  surfactant  SDS  and  the  functional  groups  (COOH)  on\nSWNTs obtained during the manufacturer\u2019s purification (CNI).  An  overall  positive  charge  was\nmeasured for the TiO2\/SWNT composite, however with a value (<+30mV) which indicates  a  less\nstable dispersion than that of the  TiO2  alone.  The  reduction  of  repulsive  (positive)  charges  of\nTiO2  by  the  negatively  charged  SWNTs\/SDS  may  be  responsible  for  this  decrease  in  zeta-\npotential.  \nThe Raman spectra of each film are shown in Fig. 2. Three characteristic peaks  were  observed  at\n411, 527 and 650 cm-1 for TiO2 (Fig. 2a). This indicates that the TiO2 sample contained mainly the\nanatase phase of TiO2 [2, 18, 19]. The Raman  spectrum  of  the  TiO2\/SWNT  composite  showed\nboth the anatase phase peaks of TiO2 and the D, G and RBM bands of the SWNTs [20]  (Fig.  2b).\nA shift of the D and G bands of SWNTs  was  observed  for  the  TiO2\/SWNT  composite.  The  D\nband of the SWNTs and TiO2\/SWNTs was observed at 1320  and  1324  cm-1  respectively,  while\nthe G band of SWNTs and TiO2\/SWNTs shifted from  1598  to  1602  cm-1,  respectively.  This  is\nattributed to the interaction between TiO2 and the SWNTs, which is desirable for its photocatalytic\napplications.\nThe  surface  morphology  of  TiO2  and   TiO2\/SWNTs   was   studied   using   scanning   electron\nmicroscopy (SEM). Fig. 3a shows the morphology of a single layer TiO2  film  after  annealing  at\n150oC and 450oC. The film obtained is uniform and porous. Fig. 3b shows the morphology  of  the\nTiO2\/SWNT composite  film.  It  can  be  seen  that  the  aggregation  of  TiO2  increases  with  the\naddition of SWNTs. The increased aggregation of TiO2 in the presence of SWNTs may be  due  to\nthe reduction of repulsive (positive) charges of TiO2 by  the  negatively  charged  SWNTs\/SDS  as\nevidenced by zeta-potential measurements (Table 1). It can also  be  seen  that  the  surface  of  the\ncomposite film is porous and uniform.\nThe TiO2\/SWNT composite was also studied using transmission electron microscopy  (TEM)  and\nEDX (Fig. 4a and Fig. 4b). The average size of the  TiO2  nanoparticles  is  approximately  20  nm.\nTEM imaging of the  composite  shows  that  it  contains  some  large  aggregated  TiO2  particles,\nwhich is consistent with the aggregation observed  in  SEM  images  (Fig.  3).   TEM  images  also\nshows aligned carbon nanotube bundles with TiO2 particles  along  the  tubes.  The  EDX  analysis\nshows that, at the analysis point, it contains the elements of Ti  (from  TiO2)  and  Cu  (due  to  the\ncopper grid). This confirms that the (20 nm) particles attached to the SWNT bundles are TiO2.\nPhoto-Electrochemical study\nCyclic voltammetry\nIn the following experiments, TiO2 and TiO2\/SWNT film electrodes were annealed  at  150oC  and\n450oC  for  an  hour  at  each  temperature  before  transfer  into  the  appropriate   electrolyte.   To\neliminate bubble formation due to dissolved oxygen in the aqueous electrolyte in all  experiments,\nthe solutions were purged with N2 for  30  min  before  use  in  the  photoreactor.  Electrochemical\nanalysis of TiO2, SWNTs and the TiO2\/SWNT composite film  (containing  equivalent  masses  of\nTiO2  and  SWNTs)   on   ITO   glass   substrates   was   performed   in   0.1   M   NaNO3\/0.01   M\nK4Fe(CN)6 (Fig. 5). The TiO2\/ SWNT composites show the highest current when  compared  with\nTiO2 and SWNTs alone under identical conditions  (equivalent  testing  area  and  material  mass).\nThis suggests that with the addition of SWNTs to TiO2 enhances the  interaction  not  only  among\nTiO2 particles, but also between the TiO2 and the ITO substrate.\nFig. 6a and 6b show cyclic voltammograms obtained from TiO2 and the  TiO2\/  SWNT  composite\nin 1.0 M NaNO3 with and without UV illumination, respectively. A  lower  current  was  observed\nfrom both TiO2 (Fig. 6a (2)) and TiO2\/ SWNTs (Fig. 6b (2()) without UV illumination, whereas  a\nmuch higher photocurrent was observed under illumination. This  shows  that  the  TiO2  is  photo-\nactive, and the addition of SWNTs improves its photoactivity possibly due to the enhancement  of\nthe electrical interaction between  TiO2  particles.  Fig.  6c  compares  the  cyclic  voltammograms\nobtained from all electrodes  under  UV-illumination.  The  TiO2\/  SWNT  composite  displayed  a\nphotocurrent response of 268 (A\/mg (at 0 V) and 350 (A\/mg (at 0.2 V), which are  5  and  6  times\nhigher than that of TiO2  electrode  respectively.  The  photocurrent  data  obtained  from  SWNTs\nshowed no difference in signal with and without UV illumination (data not shown).\nAmperometry\nFurther investigations were carried out using amperometry (at +0.8 V)  to  monitor  the  current  in\nthe dark and under UV illumination. The cell compartment contained an aqueous  solution  of  1.0\nM NaNO3. After  a  constant  base  line  was  obtained  (in  the  dark)  the  working  electrode  was\nilluminated with UV light and the photocurrent was recorded. Typical results are shown in Fig.  7.\nThe presence of SWNTs in the TiO2 film shows an increase in photocurrent response of 48 (A\/mg\nunder  UV  illumination,  which  is  approximately  6  times  of  that  of  the  pure  TiO2  film.  The\nincreased photocurrent clearly indicates the beneficial  effect  of  SWNTs  on  the  electrochemical\nproperties of the TiO2. This experiment was done with the same testing  area  for  TiO2  and  TiO2\/\nSWNTs.\nPhotocatalytic Methanol Oxidation\nThe response of cyclic voltammetric and amperometric techniques was investigated and  the  mass\nof the electrodes was recorded. In the following experiments, a 1.0 M H2SO4 solution  was  use  as\nelectrolyte.  For  methanol  degradation  experiments,  the  electrolyte  (1.0  M  H2SO4   in   water)\ncontained 1.0 M methanol. Amperometry (at 0.8 V) was used to monitor  the  current  response  of\nTiO2 and the TiO2\/ SWNT composite film with UV illumination in the  presence  and  absence  of\n1.0 M methanol (Fig. 8). When the potential was applied  in  the  dark,  a  constant  base  line  was\nobserved for each electrode around zero (A. A stable photocurrent density of about  15  (A\/mg  (a)\nand  35  (A\/mg  (b)  was  obtained  from  TiO2  in  the  electrolyte  without   and   with   methanol,\nrespectively.  This  was  done  to  elucidate   what   influence   TiO2   has   on   the   photocatalytic\ndegradation. The photocatalytic degradation of methanol by the TiO2\/ SWNT film led to  a  higher\nphotocurrent output under UV illumination than the TiO2  only  electrode.  As  in  Fig.  8  constant\nphotocurrents were observed at 336 (A\/mg for TiO2\/SWNTs in  methanol\/  H2SO4  electrolyte  (d)\nand the TiO2\/SWNT composite displayed a photocurrent response which is about 10 times  higher\nthan TiO2 only electrode, indicating that the presence of SWNTs with TiO2 electrode  significantly\nimproves  its  photocatalytic  activity  for  methanol  degradation.  This  again  suggests   that   the\naddition  of  SWNTs  into  TiO2  has  built  up  and  enhanced  the  interaction   not   only   among\nTiO2 particles but also between TiO2 particles and substrates.\nConclusion\nIn this report, we  successfully  prepared  and  characterized  a  TiO2\/SWNT  nanocomposite  with\nimproved  photocatalytic  properties  under  UV  illumination.  The  presence  of  SWNTs  in   the\nTiO2 film was found to be able to photocatalyse the oxidation of methanol, 10 times higher than  a\npure TiO2 electrode. This is an attractive way for further application in the field  of  photocatalytic\ndecomposition of organic compound  in  aqueous  media  under  UV  irradiation,  and  a  potential\nmaterial for applications involving photocatalysed fuel cells.\nAcknowledgment\nThe financials support  from  Commission  on  Higher  Education,  Government  of  Thailand  and\nFaculty of Science at Chiang Mai University, Thailand.
