E-Mail: \naemercer@liv.ac.uk  \n \n \nArtemisinin and its derivatives are \ncurrently recommended as first-line \nantimalarials in regions where Plasmodium \nfalciparum is resistant to traditional drugs. The \ncytotoxic activity of these compounds towards \nrapidly dividing human carcinoma cells and \ncell lines has been reported and it is \nhypothesised that activation of the \nendoperoxide bridge, by an iron (II) species, to \nform C-centred radicals, is essential for \ncytotoxicity. The studies described here have \nutilised artemisinin derivatives ; \ndihydroartemisinin, 10\u03b2-(p-bromophenoxy) \ndihydroartemisinin and 10\u03b2-(p-fluorophenoxy) \ndihydroartemisinin to determine the chemistry \nof endoperoxide bridge activation to reactive \nintermediates responsible for initiating cell \ndeath, and to elucidate the molecular \nmechanism of cell death. In vitro studies have \ndemonstrated the selective cytotoxic activity of \nthe endoperoxides toward leukaemia cell lines \n(HL-60 and Jurkat) over quiescent peripheral \nblood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Deoxy-10\u03b2-\n(p-fluorophenoxy) dihydroartemisinin, which \nlacks the peroxide bridge, was 50- to 130-fold \nless active in the same cells confirming the \nimportance of this functional group for \ncytotoxicity. We have shown that chemical \nactivation is responsible for cytotoxicity using \nLC-MS analysis to monitor endoperoxide \nbridge activation by measurement of a stable \nrearrangement product of endoperoxide-\nderived radicals, which was formed in sensitive \nHL-60 cells but not insensitive PBMC. In HL-\n60 cells the endoperoxides induce caspase-\ndependent apoptotic cell death; characterized \nby concentration- and time-dependent \nmitochondrial membrane depolarisation, \nactivation of caspases-3 and \u20137, sub-G0\/G1 DNA \nformation and attenuation by z-VAD.fmk, a \ncaspase inhibitor. Overall, these results \nindicate that endoperoxide-induced cell death \nis a consequence of metabolic activation of the \nperoxide bridge to radical species, which \ntrigger caspase-dependent apoptosis.  \n \nArtemisinin (ART, 1, Fig 1) is a \nsesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide found in the \ntraditional Chinese medicinal plant Artemisia \nannua (1). The activity against multidrug-resistant \nmalaria and a rapid therapeutic response (2) \nreported for ART and semi-synthetic compounds, \nsuch as artesunate and artemether, combined with \nan absence of significant toxicity in patients (3,4) \nhave led the World Health Organisation to \nrecommend the use of ART-based combination \ntherapies to all countries experiencing resistance \nto conventional monotherapies. The World Health \nOrganisation forecast that at least 132 million \ncombination therapy courses would be needed by \nthe end of 2005 (5). \nThe cytotoxic properties of ART were \nfirst observed against Ehrlich ascites tumor cells \nand have subsequently been reported in many \nother human cell lines of the 60 cell-line test panel \nat the National Cancer Institute (6-13). ART and \nits derivatives exhibit selective cytotoxicity \ntowards rapidly proliferating neoplastic cells, with \nthe highest activity reported against colon and \nleukaemia cell lines and the least against non-\n 1\nsmall cell lung cancer cells (12). The most \nsensitive cell lines are characterised by their rapid \nproliferation, often accompanied by a high \nintracellular iron concentration to sustain \ncontinued proliferation (14,15). It has been \nhypothesised that iron activation of the peroxide \nbridge is an essential event in cytotoxicity; \ncompounds without the peroxide bridge do not \ndisplay cytotoxicity (8,11); and the addition or \nchelation of iron can potentiate or inhibit \ncytotoxicity respectively (16-19). However, the \nintracellular chemistry of the endoperoxides and \nits link with the induction of cell death has yet to \nbe defined. \nIt has been suggested that Fe (II) \nactivation of the endoperoxide bridge to cytotoxic \nradical species is the chemical basis for \nantimalarial activity and is also the basis of \ncytotoxic activity in cancer cells (20,21). The \nchemistry of endoperoxide bridge degradation has \nbeen studied extensively, using Fe (II) salts and \nEPR spectroscopy, to provide a framework of \nwell-defined free radical pathways (Fig. 1) (22-\n25). Association of Fe (II) with oxygen 1 or 2 of \nthe peroxide bridge results in two oxyl radicals \n(1a, 1d) which can rearrange to a primary or \nsecondary C-centred radical (1b, 1e), respectively. \nRearrangement of these radicals produces stable \nend-products: a ring-contracted tetrahydrofuran \nacetate (THF acetate, 1c) and a hydroxydeoxo \nisomer (1f) (24-26), which have been used as \nsurrogate markers of radical formation in vitro and \nin vivo (25,27,28). Although the Fe (II) chemistry \nhas been defined, the mechanism of biological \naction remains unclear (20,22,29,30) but it is \nwidely held that iron-mediated, one-electron \nreduction of the endoperoxide bridge produces C-\ncentred parasiticidal radical species (1b and 1e) \nand that heme may be the source of ferrous iron \n(22,23,31).  \nMost commonly, cell death proceeds via \none of two different mechanisms: apoptosis or \nnecrosis (32). Necrosis is defined as passive, \npoorly regulated cell death characterised by \ncellular swelling, a loss of membrane integrity and \nthe disruption of neighbouring tissue (33,34). \nApoptosis is an active, internal cell death program \nwhich can be distinguished by its characteristic \nmorphology: the maintenance of membrane \nintegrity, the formation of membrane blebs with \ndecreasing cell volume, nuclear chromatin \ncondensation, DNA degradation, and ultimately, \nthe formation of apoptotic bodies which are \nengulfed by phagocytosis in vivo (35). Upon the \ninduction of apoptosis a conserved family of \ncysteine aspartic-acid specific proteases, known as \ncaspases, are activated in a cascade mechanism \n(36,37). The caspases comprise two functional \ngroups: the initiator caspases, -2, -8, -9 and -10, \nactivated at the onset of apoptosis, and the effector \ncaspases, -3, -6, -7, which, when activated, target \na subset of cellular proteins for proteolysis leading \nto cell death (38).  \nIt has been demonstrated that \nendoperoxide-mediated cytotoxicity in cancer \ncells proceeds via the induction of apoptosis but \nthe chemical basis of this induction has not been \ndefined (17,39-41). We have therefore \ninvestigated the metabolism of the endoperoxides \nin order to elucidate the chemical species which \nlead to cell death, and the molecular pathways \ninitiated, using a combination of chemoanalytical \nand biomolecular techniques. Dihydroartemisinin \n(DHA, 2) and two synthetic analogues, 10\u03b2-(p-\nbromophenoxy) dihydroartemisinin (PBrDHA, 3) \nand 10\u03b2-(p-fluorophenoxy) dihydroartemisinin \n(PFDHA, 4), which have increased metabolic \nstability at the acetal function (25), and the \ndeoxygenated counterpart of PFDHA, deoxy-10\u03b2-\n(p-fluorophenoxy) dihydroartemisinin (dPFDHA, \n5), which lacks the peroxide bridge, were selected \nas investigative tools to define the mechanism of \ncell death induced in two leukaemia cell lines, \nHL-60 and Jurkat, and normal, freshly isolated \nhuman PBMC. \n \nExperimental Procedures \n \nMaterials- Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from \nBio Whittaker Europe (Verviers, Belgium) and \nhuman AB serum was from Sera Laboratories \n(Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, UK). \nLymphoprep was purchased from Nycomed \n(Birmingham, UK). The human cell lines HL-60 \nand Jurkat were obtained from the European \nCollection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, Wiltshire, \nUK). Polyacrylamide gel was purchased from \nNational Diagnostics (Hessle, Yorkshire, UK). \nCaspase-3 and caspase-7 rabbit polyclonal \nantibodies were raised as described previously \n(42). Goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody \nconjugated to HRP was purchased from \n 2\nDakoCytomation (Ely, Cambridgeshire, UK). \nBradford reagent was purchased from Biorad \n(Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK). Protease \ninhibitor cocktail was purchased from Roche \nDiagnostics Ltd (Lewes, East Sussex, UK). All \nother materials and chemicals were purchased \nfrom Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, Dorset, UK). \nCell Culture and the Isolation of PBMC- HL-60 \nand Jurkat cell lines were maintained in RPMI-\n1640 medium supplemented with FBS (10% v\/v) \nand L-glutamine (1% w\/v). The cells were \nincubated under humidified air containing 5 % \nCO2 at 37 \u00baC. Cell density was kept below 1 \u00d7 106 \ncells\/ml to ensure exponential growth and to avoid \ndifferentiation of HL-60 cells, which were only \nused between passages 5 and 15. Freshly drawn \nvenous blood from healthy volunteers was \ncollected in heparinised tubes and PBMC were \nisolated as described previously (43). PBMC were \nthen diluted to the required density in RPMI-1640 \nmedium supplemented with AB human serum \n(10% v\/v), penicillin\/streptomycin solution (1% \nv\/v), L-glutamine (1% w\/v) and HEPES (2.5 % \nv\/v). Cell viability was above 95% for all \nexperiments based on trypan blue exclusion (44). \nDrug stock solutions were made up in DMSO and \nthe final solvent concentration was below 0.5 % \nv\/v in every incubation.  \nMeasurement of Cytotoxicity using the MTT (3-\n(4,5-Dimethylthiazo-2-lyl)-2,5-diphenl tetrazolium \nbromide) Assay - HL-60 cells (2.5 \u00d7 104\/well) and \nJurkat cells (1 \u00d7 105\/well) were plated, in \ntriplicate, in flat-bottom 96-well plates and were \nexposed to 0.01 to 100 \u00b5M of each compound for \n72-h. Following incubation, 20 \u00b5l of MTT \nsolution (5 mg\/ml in HBSS) was added to each \nwell and incubated for 2-h (37 \u00baC). Following \nincubation, 100 \u00b5l of a lysing buffer (20 % w\/v \nsodium dodecyl sulphate; 50 % v\/v n-\ndimethylformamide) was added to each well, to \ndissolve the formazan crystals, and incubated for a \nfurther 4-h. The absorbances of the samples were \nmeasured at a test wavelength of 570 nm and a \nreference wavelength of 590 nm with a plate \nreader (MRX, Dynatech Laboratories). The results \nare expressed as a percent of vehicle-only cells. \nThe IC50 values were calculated from individual \ninhibition curves plotted by Grafit software. \nSynthesis of Chemical Markers of Bioactivation -  \nThe degradation of PBrDHA (3) by Fe (II) was \ncarried out according to a novel method optimized \nfor solvent composition and iron salt (45). Ferrous \ngluconate (0.611g, 1.36 mmol, 2 equiv) was added \nto a stirred solution of PBrDHA (0.300 g, 0.68 \nmmol) in DMF (5 ml) and distilled water (5 ml) \nunder a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. \nThe reaction mixture was left to stir for 7-h before \ndilution with CH2Cl2 (10 ml) followed by \nextraction with CH2Cl2 (3 \u00d7 20 ml). The combined \norganic extracts were dried over anhydrous \nmagnesium sulphate and concentrated in vacuo. \nFlash chromatography using 10 % ethyl acetate \nand 90 % n-hexane as the eluent afforded the THF \nacetate isomer (6, 0.162 g, 54 %) and recovered \nstarting material (3, 0.038 g, 13 %).  \nData for (6): 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) \n\u03b4 7.35- 7.41 (2H, m, Ar), 6.95- 7.02 (2H, m, Ar), \n6.37 (1H, s, 12H), 5.43 (1H, d, J = 4.1 Hz, 10H), \n4.28 (1H, ddd, J = 9.0 Hz, 7.8 Hz, 2.1 Hz), 3.95 \n(1H, ddd, J = 16.5 Hz, 8.2 Hz, 8.2 Hz), 2.58 (1H, \nm), 2.12 (3H, s.

Found: C, 57.48, \nH, 6.22%. \nLC-MS Analysis and Quantification of \nIntracellular Endoperoxide Bioactivation -\nIntracellular iron-related activation of the \nendoperoxides was monitored using LC-MS to \nanalyse cell extracts prepared from drug-cell \nincubations. Either PBMC or HL-60 cells (150 ml \nof 1 \u00d7 106 cells\/ml) were incubated with PBrDHA \n(1.0 \u00b5M, 24-h) in the appropriate cell culture \nmedium. Following incubation, the cells were \nextracted with CHCl3 (6 \u00d7 60 ml). The extracts \nwere combined and dried over anhydrous \nmagnesium sulphate. The magnesium sulphate, \nextracted protein and cell debris were removed by \nfiltration through a scintered glass funnel and the \nsolvent removed in vacuo. The residue was \ndissolved in CH3OH (100 \u00b5L) immediately before \nanalysis by LC-MS. Aliquots were eluted from a \nSymmetry\u00ae 5 \u00b5m C8 column (150 mm \u00d7 3.9 mm; \nWaters Corp., Milford, MA) with acetonitrile \n(75%) in 10 mM ammonium acetate at a flow rate \n 3\nof 0.9 ml\/min. Eluate split-flow to the LC-MS \ninterface was ca. 40 \u00b5l\/min. Positive-ion \nelectrospray mass spectra were acquired between \nm\/z 100 and 1050, over a scan time of 5 s, with a \nMicromass Quattro II mass spectrometer (Waters \nCorp, Manchester, UK). The source temperature \nwas 80 \u00b0C. The cone and capillary voltages were \n30 V and 3.8 kV, respectively. All data were \nprocessed with MassLynx 3.5. Mass spectral data \nare presented as follows: peak retention time (Rt), \nm\/z value and assignments for the parent ion and \nmajor diagnostic peaks. The amount of PBrDHA \nTHF acetate extracted from incubations of \nPBrDHA with HL-60 cells was quantified by \nselected-ion monitoring of m\/z 458 ([M+1]+). The \ndwell time and cycle time were 200 ms and 231 \nms, respectively. A calibration curve of peak area \nversus analyte mass (2.5 \u2013 50 nmol) was generated \nfrom solutions of synthetic PBrDHA THF acetate \nin methanol. HL-60 cells or PBMC (150 \u00d7 106 and \n1 \u00d7 106 cells\/ml, respectively) were incubated with \nPBrDHA (5.0 \u00b5M, 24-h) before extraction and \nLC-MS analysis as described above. The \nefficiency of PBrDHA THF acetate recovery was \ncalculated by the incubation (24-h) and extraction \nof authentic standard compound (150 nmol) from \nHL-60 cells. \nFlow Cytometric Analysis of Sub-G0\/G1 \nPopulation - Propidium iodide (PI) was used to \nquantify cellular DNA content in order to measure \nthe formation of a sub-G0\/G1 population. \nFollowing 24-h exposure to each compound, 5 \u00d7 \n105 treated cells were washed twice in HBSS, \nfixed in 1 ml ice-cold 70% ethanol and frozen at -\n20 \u00baC. After 2-h, the 70 % ethanol was removed \nand the cell pellet resuspended 1 ml  PI staining \nsolution (PBS containing PI 40 \u00b5g\/ml, RNase 0.1 \nmg\/ml and sodium citrate 3.8 mM) and incubated \nat 37 \u00baC (30 min). A minimum of 5 \u00d7 103 cells \nwere immediately analysed by bivariate flow \ncytometry (Coulter Epics, XL software; Beckman \nCoulter, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, UK) \nand PI fluorescence was measured in fluorescence \nchannel FL-3.  \nFlow Cytometric Analysis of Mitochondrial \nDepolarisation - Mitochondrial membrane \npotential (MMP) was measured using \ntetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) to \nquantify cells with a high MMP. Drug-treated \ncells (5 \u00d7 105) were washed in HBSS, and the \nresultant cell pellet was resuspended in 500 \u00b5l of \nTMRE solution (50 nM in HBSS) and incubated \nfor 30 min at 37 \u00baC. A minimum of 5 \u00d7 103 cells \nwere analysed by flow cytometry (Coulter Epics, \nXL software; Beckman Coulter) and TMRE \nfluorescence was measured on fluorescence \nchannel FL-3.  \nWestern Blot Analysis of Caspase-3 and -7 \nProcessing  - Cells were harvested at the indicated \ntimes and washed in cold PBS once and stored at -\n20o C prior to use.  Cell lysates were prepared by \nresuspending frozen cell pellets in cold PBS \ncontaining protease inhibitor cocktail.  Cell \nsuspensions were sonicated briefly before the \nprotein concentration was measured by the \nBradford assay (46).  Lysates, with equal amounts \nof protein (20 \u00b5g per lane), were mixed with 2 \ntimes SDS-PAGE loading buffer and denatured at \n95o C for 3 min prior to being resolved on 14% \nSDS-PAGE.  Proteins were further transferred to \nnitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting \nanalysis as described previously (Sun 2002, JBC). \nStatistical Analysis - Values are expressed as a \nmean \u00b1 standard deviation of the mean (SD). Data \nwere analysed for non-normality using a Shapiro-\nWilk test. Student\u2019s t-test was used when \nnormality was indicated. A Mann-Whitney U test \nwas used for non-parametric data. All calculations \nwere performed using Arcus Quickstat statistical \nsoftware; results were considered to be significant \nwhen two sided P-values were less than 0.05. \n \nRESULTS \n \nThe Endoperoxides Exhibit Significant \nCytotoxicity in Human Cell Lines, which is \nDependent upon the Presence of the Endoperoxide \nBridge. \nThe cytotoxic activities of DHA, \nPBrDHA and PFDHA in HL-60 cells, Jurkat cells \nand PBMC were assessed by examining their \neffects upon cellular dehydrogenase activity using \nthe MTT assay (Table I). The novel \nendoperoxides PBrDHA and PFDHA displayed \nhigh levels of cytotoxicity: IC50 values \u2264 0.5 \u00b5M \ntowards both HL-60 and Jurkat cell lines. They \nwere more cytotoxic than their parent compound \nDHA, the pharmacologically active metabolite of \nfirst-generation ether and ester derivatives of ART \n(47). In these tests the novel endoperoxides were \nnot as cytotoxic as doxorubicin, a \n 4\nchemotherapeutic agent that has been included as \na positive control for cytotoxic activity toward \nleukaemia cells (48,49). Conversely, quiescent \nPBMC remained resistant to the endoperoxides. \nNo toxicity was seen at concentrations up to \n250\u00b5M and PBMC were at least 500-fold less \nsusceptible to the peroxides, thus demonstrating \nthe selective cytotoxic properties of endoperoxide \ncompounds against rapidly dividing cell lines. An \nIC50 for doxorubicin in PBMC could not be \ndetermined due to large variations in IC50 values; \npossibly arising from polymorphic expression of \nthe efflux pump p-glycoprotein in PBMC (50), of \nwhich doxorubicin is known to be a substrate (51). \nThe deoxygenated counterpart of PFDHA, \ndPFDHA, which has an ether linkage in place of \nthe peroxide bridge, displayed low levels of \ncytotoxicity: IC50 values were between 50- and \n130-fold higher than the parent compound, thus \nconfirming that the high-levels of cytotoxic \nactivity are dependent upon the presence of the \nperoxide bridge. In sensitive HL-60 cells PBrDHA \nand PFDHA exerted a time-dependent \ncytotoxicity, which was first apparent after 16 h, \nbut increased markedly at 24-h (Table II), and \nthese cells were used in subsequent investigations \n \nThe THF Acetate Isomer can be used as a Cellular \nBiomarker of Endoperoxide Bridge Activation. \nThe cellular bioactivation of the \nendoperoxide bridge was investigated using, \nPBrDHA, in susceptible HL-60 cells and resistant \nPBMC. Following 24-h incubation, chloroform \nextraction recovered the endoperoxide-derived \ncompounds from the cells and these extracts were \nanalysed by LC-MS. Traces of the THF acetate \nisomer (6, Fig. 2), which is indicative of peroxide \nbridge activation via the primary carbon centre \nradical (Fig 1), were recovered from HL-60 cells \nexposed to PBrDHA (Fig. 2A and B). The relevant \nmass chromatographic peaks were not evident in \nthe extracts of cells incubated in medium alone \n(not shown), demonstrating that these \nmeasurements result from a specific, PBrDHA \nderived compound. Quantification of the THF \nacetate isomer was achieved using a synthetic \nstandard which revealed that approximately 7% of \nthe PBrDHA had undergone activation through \nthe primary C-centred radical to form the isomer, \nallowing for an estimated 53% recovery efficiency \nof isomer from cellular incubations. The same \nanalysis was carried out following 24-h incubation \nof PBMC with PBrDHA. In these studies no THF \nacetate isomer was detected (Fig 3A), though \ntraces of the unchanged, parent compound were \npresent (Fig 3B), identifiable from its \ncharacteristic fragmentation pattern (Fig 3C).\n \nThe Endoperoxides Induce Apoptosis in HL-60 \nCells \nThe ability of the endoperoxides to induce \napoptosis was assessed by flow cytometric \nmeasurement of mitochondrial membrane \ndepolarisation and DNA degradation, which are \nboth events associated with the apoptotic pathway. \nTMRE was used to label cells with high \nmitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (52) \nand any reduction in fluorescence was attributed \nto mitochondrial membrane depolarisation (Fig. \n4A). The endoperoxides, DHA, PBrDHA and \nPFDHA (fig 4B and C) induced time- and \nconcentration-dependent depolarisation. The \nendoperoxides initiated similar extents of \ndepolarisation, with significant levels reached at \n0.5 \u00b5M, increasing until the maximum effect was \nreached at 1.0 \u00b5M after 24-h, when ~ 80% of cells \nwere depolarised. PBMC did not undergo \nmitochondrial membrane depolarisation following \ntreatment with PFDHA (0.1 - 100 \u00b5M, 24-h; data \nnot shown). Flow cytometric analysis of cellular \nDNA content with PI staining (53) was used to \nmeasure the formation of a sub-G0\/G1 population \nof apoptotic cells with degraded DNA, following \nendoperoxide treatment (Fig 5A). DHA, PBrDHA \nand PFDHA (Fig 5B and C) all induced similar \ndegrees of time- and concentration-dependent \nformation of a sub-G0\/G1 population which \nbecame significant from 16 h, reaching a \nmaximum of ~ 60% of cells in the sub-G0\/G1 \nphase (1 \u00b5M, 24-h). The deoxygenated \ncounterpart of PFDHA, dPFDHA, did not induce \nmitochondrial membrane depolarisation (Fig 4C) \nor DNA fragmentation (Fig 5C) in HL-60 cells, \nthus indicating that the peroxide bridge is essential \nfor the induction of apoptotic cell death. \n \nEndoperoxides Induce Caspase-Dependent \nApoptosis in HL-60 Cells \nThe activation of caspases-3 and -7 in \nendoperoxide-treated HL-60 cells was examined \nby Western blotting techniques which visualized \nthe processing of the inactive caspase proform to \n 5\nthe catalytically active, smaller units. In untreated \nHL-60 cells, caspase-3 was primarily present as \nthe 32 kDa proform (Fig. 6A and B lane 1). \nFollowing exposure to the endoperoxides a \nconcentration-dependent processing of caspase-3 \nwas evident by the loss of the proform and \nappearance of processed caspase-3, primarily to its \nfully processed catalytically active p17 large \nsubunit (Fig. 6A lanes, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10).  \nSimilarly, the endoperoxides induced a time \ndependent processing of caspase-3 to its fully \nprocessed p17 large subunit (Fig. 6B lanes 4, 5, 8, \n9, 12 and 13). In contrast, the inactive dPFDHA \nfailed to induce processing of caspase-3 (Fig 6A \nlanes 11-13 and 6B lanes 14-17). Caspase-7 was \nalso primarily present as the 35 kDa proform in \nuntreated cells (Fig. 6C and D lane1). PBrDHA, \nDHA and PFDHA all caused a concentration-\ndependent processing of caspase-7 to its \ncatalytically active p19 large subunit (Fig 6C lanes \n3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10), whereas no processing of \ncaspase-7 was observed with the inactive \ndPFDHA (Fig 6C lanes 11-13). Similarly, the \nactive endoperoxides, but not the inactive \ndPFDHA, also caused a time-dependent \nprocessing of caspase-7 to its active p19 large \nsubunit (Fig. 6D).   \nA caspase inhibitor, z-VAD.fmk, was \nused to examine the dependence of apoptosis upon \nactivation of the caspase cascade in endoperoxide-\ntreated HL-60 cells. Cells that had been pre-\nincubated with z-VAD.fmk (1 h pre-incubation, \n100 \u00b5M) still underwent mitochondrial membrane \ndepolarisation following 24-h treatment with DHA \nand PFDHA (1 \u00b5M) (Fig 7A). Conversely, the \npresence of z-VAD.fmk (1 h pre-incubation, 100 \n\u00b5M) inhibits DHA- and PFDHA (1\u00b5M, 24-h) \ninduced DNA fragmentation as assessed by PI \nstaining of the sub-G0\/G1 population (Fig 7B). \nThese results indicate that mitochondrial \nmembrane depolarisation is not dependent upon \ncaspase activity but that DNA degradation is. \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nART (1) and its derivatives are an \nimportant class of antimalarial agents which are \nactive against resistant strains of P. falciparum. \nThese drugs are widely used, with over 100 \nmillion courses administered annually (5), despite \nthe fact that embryotoxicity in rats and rabbits \n(54,55) and in vivo and in vitro neurotoxicity \n(18,56,57) have been reported. Artemisinins can \ndisplay cytotoxic activity in actively proliferating \nmammalian cells (6-13) and it is suggested that \ntoxicity is related to high intracellular iron \nconcentrations (16-18). It is therefore essential \nthat the chemical and molecular mechanisms of \nendoperoxide cytotoxicity are defined in order to \nassess the safe and effective use of this class of \ndrugs in the established area of malaria, and their \npotential use in the treatment of cancer (12,58). It \nwas the aim of this study to identify the chemo-\nstructural and metabolic basis of selective \nendoperoxide cytotoxicity and the molecular \nmechanism of cell death, in order to characterise \nthe type of cells that are susceptible to the \nendoperoxides.  \nWe have investigated DHA (2) because it \nis used clinically as an antimalarial and is the \npharmacologically active metabolite of some first-\ngeneration endoperoxides (59). PBrDHA (3) and \nPFDHA (4) are synthetic derivatives with \nincreased biological stability over the parent \ncompound DHA, due to the incorporation of the \nstable phenoxy linkage to increase metabolic \nstability (25). The in vitro studies (Table I) \ndemonstrated that the addition of the phenoxy \ngroup increased cytotoxic activity in HL-60 and \nJurkat cells over the parent compound, perhaps \ndue in part to the increased chemical stability of \nthe phenoxy-C bond, which could minimise \nextracellular degradation before target \nbiomolecules are reached. Importantly, we \ndiscovered that the endoperoxides are significantly \nmore cytotoxic towards rapidly dividing HL-60 \nand Jurkat cells compared with quiescent PBMC, \nwith IC50 values at least 500-fold higher in PBMC \n(Table I). This selectivity can be rationalised by \nthe iron-activation hypothesis as it is known that \nthe neoplastic cells have a high-dependence upon \niron to sustain their characteristic high levels of \nproliferation (15,60). It is interesting to note that \nsusceptible HL-60 and Jurkat cells express high \nlevels of transferrin receptors; it has been \ncalculated that HL-60 cells have 29000 \u2013 30000 \nreceptors\/cell, whilst non-sensitive cell lines such \nas lymphocytes do not (61-64). Transferrin \nreceptors are a membrane-bound family of non-\nheme iron-binding glycoproteins, which control \nthe major uptake of cellular iron and are over \nexpressed in proliferating cells (65).  \n 6\nThe importance of endoperoxide bridge \nactivation for cytotoxic activity was demonstrated \nusing a synthetic analogue of PFDHA, dPFDHA \n(5), in which the peroxide bridge has been \nreplaced by an ether linkage. Without the peroxide \nbridge cytotoxicity levels were greatly diminished, \nby 50- to 130-fold, indicating that the peroxide \nbridge is essential for the high levels of ART \nderivative-induced cytotoxicity. This structural \nrequirement for cytotoxicity was further examined \nby probing the chemistry of peroxide bridge \nactivation in sensitive HL-60 cells and resistant \nPBMC. PBrDHA was used in these studies as the \npresence of bromine in the molecule provides a \ncharacteristic isotopic pattern that facilitates LC-\nMS detection. LC-MS analysis revealed the \npresence of the THF acetate isomer (6), which is \nregarded as a marker of peroxide bridge activation \nvia rearrangement of the primary C-centred \nradical (1b), in extracts of PBrDHA-treated cells \n(Fig 2). By exploiting biomimetic techniques a \nsynthetic THF acetate isomer standard quantified \nthat approximately 7 % of the peroxide bridge had \nbeen activated to the THF acetate isomer. The low \nlevels of THF acetate detected may under-\nrepresent total bioactivation as intracellular \nreactions between the radical species and \nbiomolecular targets could compete with its \nformation. The occurrence of such reactions is \nunconfirmed but studies have shown that ART \nendoperoxides can react with proteins, via thiol \nand amino acid residues (66), and can form \nadducts with cysteine and glutathione by chemical \nsynthesis (67-70). Analysis of PBMC following \n24-h incubation with PBrDHA did not yield any \ntrace of the THF acetate isomer, but did reveal \nthat the parent compound was recoverable from \nthe cells (Fig. 3). This data demonstrates that \nbioactivation of the peroxide bridge to C-centred \nradicals occurs in susceptible HL-60 cells but not \nin resistant PBMC, providing the first chemical \nevidence for the role of C-centred radicals in \nendoperoxides\u2019 cytotoxicity and suggests that \nbioactivation of the peroxide bridge may underlie \nthe differential cytotoxicity between sensitive and \nresistant cells. \nIt was found that the endoperoxides \ninduce concentration- and time-dependent \napoptosis via mitochondrial membrane \ndepolarisation, caspase activation and DNA \ndegradation in sensitive HL-60 cells (Fig 4, 5 and \n6 respectively). Furthermore, the studies with \ndPFDHA revealed that the presence of the \nperoxide bridge is essential for the induction of \napoptosis and implied that the low levels of \ndPFDHA cytotoxic activity (Table I) proceed via \nthe induction of necrotic cell death. The induction \nof apoptosis, a specific, controlled form of cell \ndeath, by the endoperoxides explains the selective \nnature of the cytotoxicity of these compounds and \nsuggests that the cytotoxic radical species have a \nspecific subcellular target. \nA broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, z-\nVAD.fmk (71), was used to probe the dependence \nof apoptosis upon caspase activity and to further \nprobe the apoptotic mechanism. Apoptosis can be \ninitiated by various stimulants and toxicants which \nresults in the activation of different biochemical \npathways, namely the intrinsic or chemical stress-\nmediated pathway and the extrinsic or receptor-\nlinked pathway, with caspase-9 or caspase-8, as \nthe initiator caspase respectively (72), but the \nmorphology of cell death remains the same \nirrespective of the biochemical pathway initiated. \n In the present studies Z-VAD.fmk did not \ninhibit mitochondrial membrane depolarisation \nbut did inhibit DNA degradation (Fig. 7); this \ndifference is important and can be used to \nelucidate the specific apoptotic pathway triggered \nby the endoperoxides by considering the order of \napoptotic events. The lack of inhibition of \nmitochondrial membrane depolarisation indicates \nthat caspase-9 and not caspase-8 is responsible for \nthe initiation of the downstream caspases-3 and -7. \nOverall, we have demonstrated that the \nendoperoxides induce apoptosis via the chemical \nstress mediated pathway, suggesting that \nmitochondrial perturbation is an apical event in \ncytotoxicity, and that the execution of apoptotic \ncell death is dependent upon caspase activity. The \nimportance of mitochondria to the cytotoxicity of \nendoperoxides in other cell types was the subject \nof a recent study, which reported the effects of \nART on the mitochondria in a yeast model. ART \ndisrupted the normal functions of the \nmitochondria through its ability to depolarise the \nmembrane potential (73). The authors proposed \nthat the electron transport chain plays a role in \nART bioactivation and that the radicals formed act \nlocally to damage the mitochondria. \nIn summary, by using novel ART \nderivatives as chemical probes we have shown \n 7\nthat the differential cytotoxicity of these \nendoperoxides between resting and dividing cells \nis a result of selective activation of the peroxide \nbridge in susceptible cells. We have demonstrated \nthat selective targeting of metabolically active \ncells results in mitochondrial depolarisation, the \ninduction of apoptosis via the chemical stress \npathway, and the activation of caspase-3 and -7 \nculminating in the formation of hypodiploid DNA. \nCollectively this provides a chemical and \nmolecular explanation of endoperoxide-induced \ncell death (Fig.8), which can be used to identify \ncell types that might be susceptible to these drugs \nand is invaluable and aids assessments of the \npotential hazards associated with clinical use of \nthe endoperoxides.  \n \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.

IC50 \nvalues were calculated using the MTT assay following 72-h incubation with the endoperoxides, and are \nexpressed as the mean IC50 \u00b1 S.D. values calculated from the concentration-response curves of at least \nthree independent experiments. Doxorubicin was included as a positive control. N.D. \u2013 not determined.  \n \nTable II Time-dependent cytotoxicity of PFDHA and PBrDHA against HL-60 cells. IC50 values were \ncalculated using the MTT assay, and are expressed as the mean IC50 \u00b1 S.D values calculated from the \nconcentration-response curves of at least three independent experiments.  \n \nFig. 2 PBrDHA THF acetate (6) was detected in HL-60 cells following 24 h incubation with PBrDHA (3). \nHL-60 cells were extracted following incubation with PBrDHA (1 \u00b5M, 24-h) and the residues were \nexamined by LC-MS, as described in \u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d. A, ESP LC-MS analysis of the \nextracted material; selected\u2013ion chromatogram of m\/z 379, which is equivalent to the molecular ion of (6) \nminus characteristic acetate group loss, and it contains a peak (I, Rt, 11.2). B, The electrospray spectrum \nof peak I; the fragmentation pattern, showing characteristic loss of the acetate group, confirms the identity \nof peak I as PBrDHA THF acetate, 456 ([M + NH4] +), 379 ([M+ NH4 \u2013 NH3 \u2013 MeCO2H] +), 284 ([M + \nNH4 \u2013 C6H5OBr] +).  \n \nFig. 3 PBrDHA THF acetate (6) was not detected in PBMC following 24-h incubation with PBrDHA (3). \nPBMC cells were extracted following incubation with PBrDHA (1 \u00b5M, 24-h) and the residues were \nexamined by LC-MS, as described in \u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d. A, ESP LC-MS analysis of the \nextracted material; selected \u2013ion chromatograms of m\/z 456, equivalent to the ammonium adduct of the \nmolecular ion of (6), and m\/z 379, equivalent to the molecular ion of (6) minus characteristic acetate \ngroup. There is no evidence of (6, Rt 11.2) in either chromatogram. B, ESP LC-MS analysis of the \nextracted material; selected \u2013 ion chromatograms of m\/z 249, and m\/z 267, which are equivalent to \ncharacteristic fragments of the PBrDHA parent compound. Both contain a peak (I, Rt 15.8). C, The \nelectrospray spectrum of peak I; the fragmentation pattern confirms the identity of peak I as PBrDHA, \n456 ([M + NH4]+), 302 ([M + NH4 \u2013 C6H4Br]), 284 ([M + NH4 \u2013NH3 - C6H4Br]+), 267 ([284 \u2013 OH]+), \n249 ([267 \u2013 H2O]+). \n \nFig. 4 The endoperoxides induce time- and concentration-dependent mitochondrial membrane \ndepolarisation in HL-60 cells. Following treatment with the endoperoxides, HL-60 cells were stained with \nTMRE (50 nM) and the MMP was measured by flow cytometry as described in \u201cExperimental \nProcedures\u201d.  A, Representative dotplots of TMRE-stained HL-60 cells. TMRE accumulates in cells with \nhigh MMP and these cells display high fluorescence (FL-2). At 0-h, control HL-60 cells with high MMP \nappear in the upper section. Following treatment with PFDHA (1 \u00b5M, 12-h and 24-h) cells with \ndepolarised mitochondria have low MMP, therefore fluorescence, and so appear in the lower section. The \nresults were analysed to determine the concentration- and time-dependence of mitochondrial membrane \ndepolarisation in HL-60 cells. B, Concentration-dependence of mitochondrial membrane depolarisation \n(24-h). C, Time-dependence of mitochondrial membrane depolarisation (1 \u00b5M endoperoxide). Key = \u25a1 \nPBrDHA, \u25cf DHA, \u25a0 PFDHA, \u2206 dPFDHA. 5000 cells were analysed for each sample and results are the \nmean of three independent sets of experiments. ***P < 0.001 significance of PBrDHA, DHA and PFDHA \ncompared to drug blank as tested by the Mann \u2013 Whitney U Test for non-parametric data \n 11\n \nFig. 5 The endoperoxides induce time- and concentration-dependent formation of a sub-G0\/G1 population \nin HL-60 cells. The formation of a sub-G0\/G1 population following endoperoxide treatment was assessed \nby PI (50 \u00b5M) staining and flow cytometric analysis, as described in \u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d. A, \nRepresentative histograms of PI stained cells. Following intercalation with DNA, PI fluoresces in the FL-\n2 region and the sub-G0\/G1 region of this fluorescence is indicated. At 0-h few control cells have a sub-\nG0\/G1 population. Following incubation with PFDHA (1 \u00b5M, 16-h and 24-h) the number of cells in the \nsub-G0\/G1 region increases. The results were analysed to determine the dose and time-dependence of the \nformation of a sub-G0\/G1 region in HL-60 cells. B, Concentration-dependence of sub-G0\/G1 region \nformation (24-h). C, Time-dependence of sub-G0\/G1 region formation (1 \u00b5M endoperoxide). Key = \u25a1 \nPBrDHA, \u25cf DHA, \u25a0 PFDHA, \u2206 dPFDHA. 5000 cells were analysed for each sample and results are the \nmean of three independent sets of experiments. ***P < 0.001 significance of PBrDHA, DHA and PFDHA \ndata compared to drug blank, as tested by the Mann \u2013 Whitney U Test for non-parametric data \n \nFig. 6 The endoperoxides induce time- and concentration-dependent processing of caspase-3 and -7 in \nHL-60 cells. HL-60 cells were incubated with the endoperoxides, as indicated, and were then analysed by \nWestern blot, as described under \u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d, to assess caspase processing. Experiments \nwere repeated independently three times and representative gels of typical results are shown. A, \nConcentration-dependence (24-h) and B, time-dependence (1 \u00b5M endoperoxide) of caspase-3 processing \nfrom the 32 kDa proform to the 17 kDa, 19 kDa and 20 kDa processed forms. C, Concentration-\ndependence (24-h) and D, time-dependence (1 \u00b5M endoperoxide) of caspase-7 processing from the 35 \nkDa proform to the 19 kDa processed forms. * indicates non-specific binding. \n \nFig.7 Z-VAD.fmk inhibits endoperoxide-induced formation of a sub-G0\/G1 population but not \nmitochondrial depolarisation. The caspase inhibitor z-VAD.fmk was used to assess the dependence of \nendoperoxide-induced apoptosis upon caspase activity. HL-60 cells were pre-incubated with the inhibitor \n(100 \u00b5M, 1-h) before treatment with DHA or PFDHA (10 \u00b5M, 24-h).  Following incubation \nmitochondrial depolarisation and sub-G0\/G1 formation were measured as described under \u201cExperimental \nProcedures\u201d. A, The effect of z-VAD.fmk upon cell MMP. B, The effect of z-VAD.fmk upon the \nformation of a sub-G0\/G1 population. 5000 cells were analysed for each sample and results are the mean \nof three independent sets of experiments. ***P < 0.001 significance of experiments in the presence of z-\nVAD.fmk compared to experiments without the inhibitor as tested by the Mann \u2013 Whitney U Test for \nnon-parametric data \n \nFig. 8 Proposed chemical and molecular pathways of endoperoxide induced HL-60 cell death \n \n 12\nOO\nH\nOFe(III)\nO\nO\nO\nH\nO\nH\nH\nO\nO\nH\nO\n(III)OFe\nO\nO\nO\nH\nH\nH\nO\nHO\nO\n(III)FeO\nH\nO\nO\n(III)FeO\nH\nHO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nH\nSecondary C-Radical\nPrimary C-Radical\n1\n2\nART (1)\n(1a) (1b)\n(1c)\n(1d) (1e)\n(1f)\nO\nO\nOH\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nBr F\nO\nO\nO\nO\nF\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nDHA (2) PBrDHA (3) PFDHA (4) dPFDHA (5)\nFigure 1\n \n 13\n >2500.34 \u00b1 0.190.12 \u00b1 0.06PBrDHA (3)\n>2500.65 \u00b1 0.102.41 \u00b1 0.71DHA (2)\nN.D.0.09 \u00b1 0.030.02 \u00b1 0.002Doxorubicin\n>25030.71 \u00b1 10.2925.47 \u00b1 4.26dPFDHA (5)\n>2500.23 \u00b1 0.110.54 \u00b1 0.13PFDHA (4)\nPBMC\n(\u00b5M)\nJurkat\n(\u00b5M)\nHL-60\n(\u00b5M)\nMTT Assay\nTable I\n 14\n \n \n \nPFDHA (4) PBrDHA (4)\nTime (h) IC50 \u00b1 S.D.
