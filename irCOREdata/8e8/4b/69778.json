It is \nusually assumed that to be effective such tools need to \nbe precise, clearly defined, and technically robust in \ncontent. The policy actions that are proposed, partly on \nthe basis of the scientific tool, are more likely to be \nwidely accepted by all parties if the tool has the above \ncharacteristics, or so it is conventionally assumed. A \nrobust tool provides policy actors with the confidence \nthat it represents real processes sufficiently well for \ngood policy analysis; a precise tool permits policy deci- \nsions to be precise also; and clarity allows the various \nassumptions and commitments behind the analysis, \nincluding those of the participating parties, to be ex- \npressed in a transparent and open fashion. \n'E-mail. s.shack1eyOlancaster.a~ uk \nO Inter-Research 1997 \nThe technical definition and content of GWPs is hotly \ndebated amongst specialists, in terms of what vari- \nables should be used to calculate the index and how. \nAccording to some scientists GWPs are not techni- \ncally robust. \nGWPs are not clearly defined but subject to mult~ple \ninterpretations. Hence they are ambiguous rather \nthan clearly defined or precise. \nDiscussions over GWPs in policy contexts often incor- \nporate implicit policy and value judgements: hence \nGWPs can be characterised as 'hybrids' between sci- \nence and policy, rather than being purely scientific in \ncontent, or incorporating explicit policy choices in a \ntransparent way. \nRather than perceiving these features to be a 'prob- \nlem', which stands in need of solution, we will argue \n90 Clim Res 8: 89-106, 1997 \nthat they are an  almost inevitable component of scien- \ntific tools for policy and suggest why that may be the \ncase. First, however, we should explain why we think \nthe reader should be interested in our analysis. There \nhas been considerable scientific and policy attention to \nGWPs over the last 6 or 7 yr, including discussions and \ncontroversies, workshops and IPCC deliberations. We \nknow, therefore, that those in influential positions in \nthe climate change science-policy dialogue believe \nthere is something important about GWPs to discuss \nand argue over. It is fair to assume from the attention \nthey have received that GWPs have also been reason- \nably important to the way in which climate policy has \nbeen thought about and developed. We are also faced \nwith some fascinating empirical facts: that very simple \nindices were being proposed for policy making even \nthough millions of dollars have been spent on develop- \ning much more complex policy-relevant science (cli- \nmate models for example); that the calculation of \nGWPs changed rather dramatically over very few \nyears; that social scientists became involved in the \ndebate and a struggle over what should be included in \na greenhouse gas index emerged; that some scientists \ndismissed GWPs as b e ~ n g  over-simple or unrealistic; \nand so on. \nOur purpose is to shed some light on the debates \nover GWPs from a somewhat different perspective, \nthat of the sociology of science. We are interested in \nthe meanings given by scientists and policy makers to \nGWPs, why they thought about them in a particular \nway, how they related to the other concerns of those \nparticipants, and so on. But this is not just an exercise \nin academic sociology. There are also important impli- \ncations for how scientists and policy makers conceive \nof the role of climate science in policy, not just in the \ncase of GWPs but more widely. The debates over \nGWPs concern much more than the development of \nan  instrument for producing numbers for optimal \nGHG-emission control policies. Other important un- \nanticipated effects have emerged from the develop- \nment of GWPs, including the creation of a new com- \nmunity for relating science and policy. Such social \ndimensions are not divorced from the way in which \nGWPs are constructed, presented and used, a finding \nwhich has important implications for the range of pol- \nicy options constdered, the ways of assessing alterna- \ntive policy choices, and the development of knowledge \nto assist policy. \nOur intention therefore is not to assess GWPs in a \nnarrow sense, for example with respect to the criteria \nof precision, clarity and robustness, or vis-a-vis the pol- \nicy ambitions of the Framework Convention on Cli- \nmate Change (FCCC), or to suggest how they might \nbetter fulfil that role. To do so would require us to take \nour own position on what should be the goals of the \nFCCC given that they are presently unclear, and for \nourselves to judge the scientific credibility of GWPs. \nWe are more interested here in interpreting scientific \ndebates about the credibility of GWPs, and in under- \nstanding those arguments in their social and policy \ncontext, than in engaging in such a debate ourselves. \nNor are we attempting to address a specific, highly \nfocused 'problem', in large part because the real-life \nscience and policy discussions do not present us with \ndiscrete, well-defined problems, but rather messy, \nambiguous, changing and interrelated problems. What \nthe 'problem' is changes depending on whom you \nspeak to, where, when and in what circumstances. Our \ninterest is in understanding how problems are defined \nby the scientists and policy makers themselves, and \nthe implications of this for the development of climate \nchange science and policy. We urgently need better \nunderstanding, interpretation and reflection upon the \n'wicked problems' which emerge from real world pol- \nicy debate if climate change science is to have more \neffective impact upon policy making. For convenience \nthe key questions which guide the paper are listed \nbelow. \n(1) What features of GWPs have influenced their role \nas scientific tools for policy? And why? \n(2) What role do GWPs play in the provision of scien- \ntific advice for policy making? \n( 3 )  Are GWPs precisely and clearly defined, or \nambiguous? \n(4) Are the positions taken, and debates over, GWPs \nonly technical and scientific in character or do they \nalso involve social and policy preferences and\/or \ncommitments, some of which are 'hidden' rather \nthan deliberately chosen? \n(5) If social and policy elements are part of the debate \nover GWPs what are they? Where do they come \nfrom? And have they been openly debated or do \nthey emerge by default? \n(6) What are the implications for the development of \nscientific tools for climate change policy making? \nIn Section 2 we define GWPs and chart their devel- \nopment from 1990 to 1996, paying attention to the \ndebates and controversies which GWPs have sparked \noff, and use a typology to characteri.se these. In \nSection 3 we argue that GWPs have an ambiguous \nmeaning, and provide an interpretation of why this \nmay well be helpful to their continued development \nand use. In Section 4 we turn our attention to the \nhybrid mixture of scientific, social and policy choices \nand commitments incorporated in discussions over \nGWPs. In the final section, we argue that GWPs may \nbe unintentionally supporting certain approaches to \nclimate policy analysis, especially a focus on green- \nhouse gas emissions, but that if GWPs were appraised \nShackley & Wynne: Global Warr~~~nr j  Potentials and policy \nmore realistically then other policy options might be- \ncome more attractive. \n2. KEY DEBATES SURROUNDING GWPs \nThe rationale for GWPs is that a range of gases con- \ntribute to anthropogenic climate change and that pol- \nicy under the FCCC to reduce emissions therefore \nrequires: 'An index to compare the contribution of var- \nious \"greenhouse\" gas emissions to global warming . .  . \nto develop cost-effective strategies for limiting this \nwarming' (Lashof & Ahuja 1990: p 529). This 'compre- \nhensive approach' has been advocated strongly and \ndeveloped by the US government from the late 1980s \nto the present day (and now by other governments) \nand is incorporated into the FCCC (United States \nDepartment of State 1989, Informal Seminar 1990, \nStewart & Wiener 1990, Morgenstern 1991, Task Force \n1991). \n2.1. GWPs as  scientific tools for policy \nTo go beyond the early focus of analysis and policy \non CO2 required a metric for comparing the properties \nof different GHGs. They all have varying emissions \nand atmospheric concentrations, radiative forcing \nproperties per molecule, and life-times so that to com- \npare their greenhouse effects requires a method for \ntaking these differences into account. GHGs with a rel- \natively large radiative forcing but short life-time, such \nas methane, diminish in importance as contributors to \nthe enhanced greenhouse effect as the time horizon for \nthe calculation of effects increases, whilst COz, with a \nrelatively small radiative forcing but long life-time, \nincreases in relative significance. An important further \ncomplication is that some GHGs and non-GHGs have \nindirect effects, whereby a particular gas influences \nthe concentration or life-time of another gas (or even of \nitself, in the case of methane) and,  therefore, its GWP. \nIn principle, it should have been possible to use \ncomplex climate models, such as General Circulation \nModels (GCMs), to assess the relative contributions to \nradiative forcing and warming of different scenarios \nof GHGs after a given time period. In practice, how- \never, this use of GCMs as a comparative tool went far \nbeyond the technical and scientific capabilities and \nresources then (or now) available. An important prece- \ndent in developing a simple model was the comparison \nof different ozone depleting chemicals using Ozone \nDepletion Potentials (ODPs). In the late 1980s \/ early \n1990s, a similar approach was adopted in the develop- \nment of GWPs for each GHG (Lashof & Ahuja 1990, \nDerwent 1990, Rodhe 1990). Much of this analysis \nwas motivated by the need for such an  index in the \n1990 report of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change),  reflecting the US government's \ncommitment to the comprehensive approach. In 1990, \nthe IPCC defined GWPs according to the following \nequation. \nGWP = \n1: a,c,dt \n~ C O > C C O , ~ ~  \nwhere 'a, is the instantaneous radiative forcing due  to a \nunit increase in the concentration of trace gas,  1, c, is \nconcentration of the trace gas, i, remaining at time, t, \nafter its release and n is the number of years over \nwhich the calculation is performed. The corresponding \nvalues for carbon dioxide are  in the denominator' \n(IPCC 1990: p 58). The numerical value of GWPs is \ndependent on the time horizon used in their calcula- \ntion. So, for example, a s  one advisory scientist to the \nIPCC has put it, if a long time horizon is used: \nrelatively short lived and powerful greenhouse gases \n(such as the HFCs) can appear unimportant, even though \nunrestrained growth in emissions could make the gases \nsignificant contributors to total forcing. A short horizon \nwould, however, make a less powerful but long-lived gas \n(N,O is an example) look unimportant. \nIn its 1990 assessment the IPCC used 3 periods over \nwhich to calculate GWPs, 20, 100 and 500 yr, noting \nthat: 'These 3 different time horizons are presented as \ncand~da tes  for discussion and should not be considered \na s  having any special significance' (IPCC 1990: p 59). \nFlexibility, adaptability, economy and 'do-ability' a re  \nthe apparent advantages of GWPs over more complex \nmodels-for example in readily matching possible \nmeasures to policy objectives by illustrating how emis- \nsions of GHGs differ, on a common scale, in their \nshort-, medium- and  long-term warming propensities.' \nThis instrumental use of GWPs as tools for policy to \nhelp implement the comprehensive approach is not the \nonly way to understand their rationale. As one scientist \nnoted, GWPs were developed: \n'I t  may be asked why simple, l-dimensional climate models \nwere not preferred over (;WPs. In fact Wigley & Reeves \n(1991) did apparently provide some such results. That GWPs \nwere preferred is probably accounted for by the fact that it is \nwidely questioned whether such l - D  models could capture \nthe spatially-dependent interaction between atmospheric \nchemistry and dynamics. Hence their greater complexity \nmight not have been perceived as an advantage over GWPs \n(in terms of providing reliable additional information). Sim- \nple climate models are also only simple relative to GCMs. As \na tool for policy, they are still rather complex and require the \nactive involvement of the modelling team \n92 Clim Res 8: 89-106, 1997 \nwith a very simple requirement tvhich was to give policy \nmakers an idea oi the sorts of gases which could con- \ntribute to global warming.

GWPs in the IPCC 1990 report \nGWPs were presented to the policy world by the \nIPCC in its 1990 report as fairly reliable and resilient \ntools. Uncertainties in the methodology were acknowl- \nedged (though not quantified) and the preliminary sta- \ntus of the quantitative values made clear. For example, \nlead authors of the relevant IPCC chapter noted that: \n..the indirect GWPs reported in IPCC (1990) are likely \nto be in error and should not be used' (IPCC 1992: \np 55). The statement in 1992 that 'we can estimate the \nsign most likely for [the indirect effects of] some com- \npounds based on current understanding' (ibid.) is a far \ncry from IPCC9O. Furthermore, the table of GWPs in \nIPCC92 appeared with a number of disconcerting \nwarnings, such as: 'The lifetimes of the various species \nare not as precisely known as the Table suggests' and \n'The indirect GWPs are uncertain but could conceiv- \nably be comparable in magnitude to the direct GWPs' \n(IPCC 1992: Table A2.1, p 56). \nOne of the most dramatic changes was in the calcu- \nlation of the GWP for the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). \nIn the 1990 assessment these were stated to collec- \ntively account for 24 % of the current contribution of \nGHGs to potential global warming. In the 1992 report, \nthe CFCs were considered not to have any warming \npotential, because of their effect in depleting another \nGHG, namely ozone in the lower stratosphere, the 2 \neffects cancelling each other out. \nIn IPCC92 there was a more complete discussion \nthan in IPCC9O of the methods involved in calculating \nGWPs and their accompanying uncertainties and \nassumptions (IPCC 1992: p 54-55). It was stated that \nGWPs can only be provided for well-mixed, long-lived \ngases which absorb long-wave radiation, and not for \nIt must be stressed that there is no universally accepted \nmethodology for combining all the relevant factors into a \nsingle global warming potential for greenhouse gas \nemissions. In fact there may be no single approach which \nwill represent the needs of policy makers. .

Calculation of GWPs cannot take \naccount of latitudinal, and seasonal variations, nor of \nshort-lived gases such as CO, non-methane hydro- \ncarbons (NMHCs) or NO,. In IPCC92 the same time \nhorizons are used as in IPCC9O and the somewhat \nstronger claim is made that: 'It is believed that these \nthree time horizons provide a pract~cal range for policy \napplications' (IPCC 1992: p 54). \nIt was also noted in IPCC92 that GWPs measure sur- \n'This rationale is also ment~oned by one of the developers of face-troposphere radiative forcing, not surface warm- \nan alternative Index, the World Resource Institute's Green- Ing (the response to forcing), climate models can be \nhouse Index, who noted that: 'A goal of the index was to \nmake it simple for nations to assess their relative rank and used to predict warming from forcing, but such an \nprogress in a simple manner without needing elaborate corn- exercise 'must be approached with caution' (IPCC \nputer models' (pers. comm. 27 November 1995) 1992: p 54). And it was also observed that: 'although \nShackley & Wynne: Global Warmlng Potentials and pol~cy 93 \nthe GWP of a well-mixed gas can be regarded as a \nfirst-order indicator of the potential global mean tem- \nperature change due to that gas relative to CO,, it is \ninappropriate for predicting or interpreting regional \nclimate responses' (ibid.). In summary, a shift to scepti- \ncism occurred in 1992 given recognition of the com- \nplexity of the scientific issues. \nThere are potential credibility problems for GWPs in \nthis shift of perceptions over just a few years. The \nrepercussions were felt, for example, in hearings of the \nUS Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Re- \nsources in May 1992. Senator Wallop questioned \nwhether the IPCC was disingenuous in stating in its \n1992 report that: 'Findings of scientific research since \n1990 do not affect our fundamental understanding of \nthe science of the greenhouse', given the change in \nopinion on the role of CFCs (MacCracken 1992). \nMeanwhile, the press in the United Kingdom picked \nup on the same issue at a press-briefing. The following \nheadlines appeared in the UK press on the 20th \nDecember 1991: 'Has it been a waste of time getting \nrid of our aerosols?', 'Doomsday is delayed as scientists \nblow hot and cold on the ozone layer' (Today 20\/12\/91), \n'UN environmentalists find silver lining in cloud of \nCFCs' (Daily Telegraph 20\/12\/91); and 'CFC global \nwarming role in doubt' (Guardian 20\/12\/91). The \nChairman of the IPCC, Professor Bert Bolin, reported \nverbally at an IPCC meeting in Bath (UK) in 1993 that \nthe IPCC92's presentation of GWPs had caused a lot of \nanxiety amongst policy makers because it implied that \nGWPs were not very useful. \n2.4. GWPs in the IPCC 1994 report \nOne of the most important issues for Working Group I \n(WGI) of the IPCC (which IS responsible for assessment \nof scientific processes) following publication of its sup- \nplementary report in 1992 was to decide what to do \nabout GWPs. A common opinion at the Bath WGI meet- \ning (coded here WGI 93) was that the 1990 report had \noversold the idea of GWPs, but that the 1992 report had \ngone too far the other way and that the balance now had \nto be readjusted. The IPCC's report Radiative Forcing of \nClimate Change (IPCC 1995) sought to re-establish the \ncredibility of the GWP. It contains a highly detailed \naccount of GWPs, their assumptions, and of the diverse \nscientific knowledge behind them, and defines that \ngroup of gases for which it is worth calculating direct and \nindirect GWPs. For example, unlike what was done in \n1992, the direct and indirect effects of methane are \ncalculated. The 1992 decision to omit calculating GWPs \nfor NO,, CO and NMHCs is sustained because of a lack \nof knowledge: 'This does not imply that they are not \nsignificant for radiative forcing' (IPCC 1994: p 224). \nMeanwhile, the 1992 opinion that the indirect effects \nof CFCs would cancel out their direct effects was mod- \nifled in 1994. The new position was that the GWPs for \nCFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs could conceivably be posi- \ntive or negative, and that the uncertainties arising from \naltitudinal and latitudinal dependence of the indirect \neffects prevented any more definite calculation. Also, \nin IPCC94 there is a reasonably lengthy discussion of \nthe role of policy decisions in calculating GWPs. \n2.5. Some critical issues surrounding changing \npresentations of GWPs \n2.5.1. Arbitrary time horizons? \nIPCC9O suggested that if sea-level rise is the impacts \nissue of interest then a 100 yr time horizon is appropri- \nate, whilst if it is precipitation then a 20 yr horizon is \nmore suitable. And in 1994, the IPCC noted that: \n'GWPs with differing time horizons can aid in estab- \nlishing such a mix [of emphases given the type of effect \nw ~ t h  which one is concerned]' (IPCC 1994: p 229). \nAlthough not mentioned in IPCC reports, variable \ntime-horizons might also be required for the same cat- \negory of impact because of local and regional condi- \ntions and differential sensitivities, including the effects \nof natural and social variability and past damage due \nto climate change and other factors (acidification, other \nforms of pollution, ozone depletion, and so on). \nA policy framework using GWPs is therefore faced \nwith the problem of either using variable 'customised' \ntime horizons or of producing an 'average' time hori- \nzon (taking account of the differential impacts upon \nsystems at different times). The use of multiple, cus- \ntomised time-horizons is problematic because it ques- \ntions the global definition of climate change as a single \npolicy problem, weakening the rationale for a global \nagreement on GHG emission reductions (seen as \nnecessary given the geographical divorce between \nsources of GHGs and climate change impacts) (Brown \n& Adger 1993). And as Fuglestvedt & Skodvin (1996) \npolnt out, multiple time-horizons compromise the com- \nparability of different gases, the whole point of the \nexercise! The apparent flexibility of GWPs in allowing \nthe policy maker to choose the most appropriate time- \nhorizon is then revealed as rather illusory.\" \n3 H o ~  would an average time horizon be chosen? Should it be \nnationally specific, or a global average? If different national \naverages were used, this would allow greater opportunity for \npol~t~cal  manipulation of national analyses It might also, \nparadoxically, give more weight to impacts from countries \nwith a disproportionately large share of GHG emissions. Us- \ning a globally averaged time-horizon might also risk entering \na 'zero sum game', as what one country gained from a chosen \ntime-horizon, another lost (Fuglestvedt & Skodvin 1996) \nCLim Res 8: 89-106. 1997 \n2.5.2. Discount rates \nSome economists have argued that instead of using \nvariable time-horizons GWPs should include a dis- \ncount rate factor to take account of the extent to which \ndamage in the present is more valued by society than \nat some point in the future. By contrast, the IPCC's \nGWPs give equal weight to all included climate effects \nup to some time horizon, T, and zero weight thereafter. \nWallis & Lucas (1994) comment that: \nThis is unfortunate because there is no objective way of \nsetting time-horizon T ... there is no way to avoid implicit \nweighting between gases and between human genera- \ntions. Implicit in the IPCC choice are certain value judge- \nments that put the GWP function into the ambit of soci.al \nscience \n(Wallis & Lucas 1994, see also Wallis 1994) \nIn fact, Lashof & Ahuja's original paper of 1990 had \nused a n  exponential discount rate with the horizon \nextended to infinity. This is hardly more convincing to \nmany analysts, however, because it does not take \naccount of the non-linearity between temperature \nchange and climate change impacts and costs. As Eck- \naus put it: 'it cannot be presumed that the economic \nevaluations of radiative forcing in successive penods \nwill decline at  exactly the discount rate' (1992: p 27) \n(also, Wuebbles & Edmonds 1991, Reilly 1992, Reilly & \nRichards 1993). In other words, emissions of a short- \nlived gas relative to CO2 might not be  so important at \ntime, t , ,  as at time t 2 ,  where t2 falls in a period when \nthe impacts of, and damage from, a given rate of tem- \nperature increase are greater than at t l  because of the \nnon-linear relationship between temperature and cli- \nmate impacts (Kandlikar 1995, Hammitt et al. 1996). \nFurthermore, even though there is a well-developed \neconomic literature on discount rates, the choice of a \ndiscount rate for the case of future climate change is \nstill arbitrary, and the final result will be very sensitive \nto the particular rate chosen (Kandlikar 1995). \nHammitt et al. (1996) conslder the situa.tion in which \nclimate-induced damages depend only on the maxi- \nmum global annual-mean surface temperature reach- \ned. Again, incremental emissions of CH, will have \nnegligible effects compared with emissions from a rel- \natively long-lived gas such as COz, if the emissions \ntake place far enough before the year in which the \nmean temperature peaks. For this reason, Kandlikar, \nHammitt et al., and other analysts argue that an index \nhas to incorporate different GHG emissi.on scenarios. \nKandlikar notes that otherwise there is a danger that \nGWPs would promote reduction of short-lived GHGs \nin the near future as a more effective policy response \nthan is in reality the case. Reilly also argues that GHGs \nhave non-greenhouse-related properties which should \nbe counted as credits (e.g. CO2 fertilisation of crops) or \ndebts (e.g. CFCs depleting 03) (Reilly 1992), this being \nthe logical extension of the comprehensive approach \naccording to its advocates (Stewart & Wiener 1992, \nWiener 1995). Wallis & Lucas (1994) also point out that \nGWPs do not take account of the rate of change of forc- \ning, even though this is a key policy-relevant variable \n(cf. Handel 1991). Whilst this limitation is recognised in \nIPCC94, the IPCCSO and the World Meteorological \nOrganisation (WMO 1992) also suggest that GWPs can \nbe used to explore the rate of change of temperature, \nsea-level rise, and so on, in the context of providing \nadvice to policy (through the choice of time horizon). \nNote that the above analysts refer to the effects and \nimpacts of climate change caused by different GHGs. \nHence they convert radiative forcing of GWPs into sur- \nface temperature change (by use of a climate model) \nand then use an algorithm for relating temperature \nchange to damages (of a quadratic, linear, logarithmic \nform, etc.). The further down-stream effects (see Fig. 1) \nare also included in some formulations by calculating \nthe economic damages of those impacts with an  eco- \nnomic model. \n2.6. A typology for understanding debates over \nGWPs \nThe perceived stability of GWPs is one of the main \npoints of disagreement in the debates around their \nusefulness. By perceived stability is meant the degree \nto which GWPs are perceived as scientifically certain \nand robust (with respect to the separate data selected \nand used and the method by which information is \naggregated). A second key point of contention is the \nperceived comprehensiveness of the index, that is the \nextent to which it includes all the factors and variables \nheld to be relevant in comparing the greenhouse prop- \nerties of different GHGs (as shown in Fig. 1). A green- \nhouse index can be made more comprehensive by \nvirtue of including more of the down-stream variables \nin the chain from physical effects, to effects upon bio- \nphysical systems, to impacts upon human systems. \nThese 2 dimensions are depicted in Fig. 2 in which \nwe have also mapped out the change in relative posi- \ntion of GWPs from 1990 to 1994 as well as the range of \nopinion on where GWPs should be located in the \nfuture. As indicated in Fig. 2, the IPCC has a consis- \ntently narrow view of GWPs as based on an up-stream \nphysical formulation (radiative forcing). Not all climate \nscientists have agreed with the IPCC's judgement that \nGWPs are stable. A workshop held in 1990 identified \nmany of the key scientific issues, assumptions and \nuncertainties surrounding GWPs (Workshop 1991). \nHarvey, for example, concluded that: 'Given the enor- \nShackley & Wynne:  G loba l  W a r m i n g  Potentials a n d  po l i cy  \nphyslcal environmenlal \nDrocesses effects \neffects upon \nhuman systems \n'down-stream' \ne.g. Economlc - \ndamage index \n(Hammitt et al. 1996) \nviews see e .g .  Enting & Rodhe 1991, \nCaldeira & Ka.sting 1993, Wuebbles et  al. \n1995). The majority of social science and \npolicy analysis commentators also argue \nthat the IPCC's index is currently rather \nunstable, not because of its natural sci- \nence component, but rather because it \ndoes not include 'down-stream' social and \neconomic variables. A group of econo- \nmists and climate scientists at the Massa- \nchusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) \ncombined forces in prepanng a brief note \non why GWPs were inadequate in terms \nof atmospheric chemistry, economics and \nthe needs of policy (Joint Program, no \nF l g  1. T h e  cha in  f rom physical  effects to  socio-economic impacts date). \nSince the more comprehensive index \nwould indeed seem to be  more policy rel- \nmous uncertainties in the calculation of GWPs and evant, why has the IPCC not developed the index in \ntheir dependence on future scenarios, it is difficult to that way? When asked about the inclusion of economic \nsee how they could be used in any rigorous way for factors into GWPs, several IPCC scientists responded \npolicy analysis' (Harvey 1993: p 29; for other specialist that GWPs were already confusing, complicated and  \nSTABLE \nFig. 2.

One interpretation of this response is that \nthe advisory scientists consider the increased compre- \nhensiveness to come at the cost of greater uncertainty \nand instability in the index, even if the narrower index \nis less directly comprehensible or meaningful in a \nsocial or economic sense (in terms of Fig. 2 ,  the per- \nceived comprehensiveness scale would slope down- \nwards the further it move to the right). Such instability, \nand loss of precision (and intellectual control) which \nwould accompany an increase in scope, appears to \nhave been considered by these IPCC scientists to dam- \nage the authority of the index in policy contexts. Hence \nthe preference for the more restricted, but also more \ncertain, up-stream physical definition of GWP (i.e. \nthere is an implicit trade-off between potential 'useful- \nness' in policy contexts and certainty: the more poten- \ntially policy useful, the less certain the knowledge). \nThis judgement of scientists has been criticised by \nEckaus who notes that: 'There is no easy way out of \nconfronting the cost to society of reducing radiative \nforcing. Certainly, it would never be suggested that, \nbecause of the necessity of 'keeping the argument sim- \nple', basic features of atmospheric chemistry should be \npassed over' (1992: p 34). \nIn this section we have seen that there is a lively \ndebate amongst specialists concerning the technical \nconstruction of a GWP-type index. We have also noted \n3 different roles for GWPs as scientific tools for policy. \nThe instrumental role refers to the direct use of the \nGWP numbers in policy making; the symbolic role to \nthe function of illustrating that more than CO2 is \ninvolved in causing anthropogenic climate change; \nand the interactional role to the attempt to involve fur- \nther scientists and policy makers in climate change \nissues from countnes without strong modelling capa- \nbilities. \n3. AMBIGUITY IN SCIENCE FOR POLICY AND ITS \nPOSSIBLE ROLE \nEven amongst natural scientists who accept the \nIPCC's narrow definition of GWPs, there are a range of \nviews on the precise calculation of GWPs. From sur- \nveying the literature we have identified 8 technical \nissues upon which there are differing opinions \namongst climate scientists. We call these cases where \n4The text in IPCC94 explicitly mentions discount~ng a.p- \nproaches but then notes: 'The possibility of coupling such \nfactors to the GWP definition requires detailed study of eco- \nnomics and policy impl~cations, together with the require- \nment for scientific accuracy, and is beyond the scope of the \npresent review' (IPCC 1994. p 216) \nthere is no single, or clearly 'correct', answer examples \nof ambiguity. There is: \n(1) Ambiguity as concerns the choice of GHGs for \nwhich GWPs are calculated (raising questions over \nthe implications of spatial and temporal variability). \n(2) Ambiguity as concerns whether, and how, indirect \neffects are included in the calculation of GWPs. \n(3) Ambiguity in the time horizons for which GWPs are \ncalculated. Or ambiguity in the discount rates \nchosen. \n(4) Ambiguity in the parameter of climate change \nwhich is being measured in the GWP calculation. \n(5) Ambiguity in the atmospheric residence time cho- \nsen for CO,. \n(6) Ambiguity in whether the GWPs are calculated \nusing sustained emissions of GHGs or a pulse emis- \nsion. \n(7) Ambiguity over whether GWPs can be used to \nassess the rate of change in systems affected by cli- \nmate change. \n(8) Ambiguity over whether GWPs can stand alone in \npolicy analysis or require further added-on scientific \ntools (such as climate models) before they are useful. \n3.1. Some evidence of ambiguity \nWe do not intend to discuss all the above sources of \nambiguity in detail. For illustrative purposes only, we \nwill expand on the fourth type of ambiguity. The IPCC \nhas in several places carefully defined GWPs as mea- \nsuring the radiative forcing of GHGs, not the climate \nresponse (such as temperature). Yet, the rationale for \nGWPs in the Policymakers Summary of IPCC9O stated \nthat: 'To evaluate possible policy options, it is useful to \nknow the relative radiative effect (and, hence, poten- \ntial climate effect) of equal emissions of each of the \ngreenhouse gases' (IPCC 1990: p xix). The statement in \nbrackets implied that the relative potential climatic \neffect of GHGs was indicated by GWPs. \nOne of the earliest research papers to calculate \nGWPs referred directly to the temperature response \n(Derwent 1990). The author recalls that the use of \nresponse i.n the calculation did not cause any problems \nat a WGI meeting at Crowthorne (UK) in preparation of \nIPCC9O (Derwent pers. comm. July 1996). Several cli- \nmate modellers involved in IPCC then believed in a \nsimple linear relationship between forcing and tem- \nperature rise for the equilibrium case. Soon after that, \nthe first major transient runs of GCMs questioned the \nrealism of equilibrium studies, making the relationship \nbetween forcing and temperature unclear (ibid.). \nThe IPCC 1992 report made clear the distinction \nbetween forcing and response, noted that GWPs could \nbe regarded as a first-order indication of global, but \nShackley & Miynne: Global Warming Potentials and pollcy 97 \nnot regional, response, and also cautioned against any \nsimple translation of forcing into response. The IPCC \nattempted to set the record straight in its 1994 report: \nFurther, the GLVP as defined here is only a measure of \nrelative r a d ~ a t ~ v e  forcing, not a measul-e of potent~al \ndamage result~ng from possible climate change that \nincludes economic or other variables. These limitations \nshould be kept in m ~ n d  in economic or policy analysis. \n(IPCC 1994: p 216) \nThis quotation is unclear on the extent to which \nGWPs can legitimately refer to the climatic response \n(as opposed to the more down-stream measure of \npotential damage referred to in the quote). The ambi- \nguity over forcing\/response reflects uncertainty and \nchanging knowledge amongst the climate change \ncommunity (for example vis-a-vis equilibrium GCM \nruns around 1990). That the global mean temperature \nchange at  the surface and troposphere is relatively \nindependent of the forcing mechanism (i.e. a constant \nclimate sensitivity) has been a commonly adopted \nheuristic within the climate modelling community. \nFuglestvedt & Skodvin note that: 'This gives support to \nthe application of radiative forcing as an appropriate \nindex that could be  used to assess both the absolute \nand relative climatic impacts of changes in forcing' \n(1996: p 35). In a study published in 1994 Taylor & Pen- \nner used a GCM, coupled to a n  atmospheric sulphur \nmodel, to analyse the effects of including an  increase \nin both sulphate aerosol and carbon dioxide concentra- \ntion upon radiative forcing (Taylor & Penner 1994). \nOne plausible interpretation of this experiment was \nthat the climate sensitivity may be different for gases \nwhich generate different patterns of horizontal and \nvertical radiative forcing (Wigley 1994). The ambiguity \nover the precise interpretation of GWPs accommodates \nthe dominant scientific belief in a constant climate sen- \nsitivity, as well as the indeterminacy that it may turn \no'ut to vary for different forcings. \nIt is not surprising that users of GWPs have fre- \nquently regarded them as indicative of a climate \nchange response. After all, they are termed Global \nWarming Potentials and it is difficult to see how they \ncould be  sensibly advocated for policy use if they did \nnot indicate some first-order response, even if the sci- \nentific basis for the relationship is not rigorously estab- \nlished. For example, a U S  government report from \n1991 compared GWPs to model calculations and stated \nthat: 'The differences between the climate model ap- \nproach and the GWP calculation arise in part because \nthe climate model approach calculated realized tem- \nperature change while the GWP calculated equilib- \nrium temperature change' (Task Force 1991: p 20; \nemphasis added), hence claiming that GWPs measure \none feature of the response to forcing. \nThere may have been contingent reasons to do with \nthe US government's desire to establish a system \nwithin which permits for greenhouse gas emissions \ncould be traded which help account for that particular \ninterpretation of GWPs, likewise its optinlistic views \nabout the ability of the index to cope with uncertainty \nand a rapidly changing knowledge-base, since any \nsuch policy would require at  a minimum a robust \nGWP-type index.' Without GWPs, the comprehensive \napproach would just not be feasible, and a 'carboncen- \ntric', command-and-control type regulatory regime \nwould have become more credible, a politically un- \nacceptable alternative for the US g ~ v e r n m e n t . ~  In this \npolitical context, some ambiguity in the precise techni- \ncal meaning of GWPs serves an  important function, \nsince it allows the implication to be made that the GWP \nis a measure of the response a s  well as of the forcing. \nThis in turn lends support to that policy response-the \ncomprehensive approach-which is most politically \ndesirable. If GWPs were more strictly defined by tech- \nnical experts in policy contexts then they would lend \nless support to the comprehensive approach, and so \nsupport for GWPs would be less likely from advocates \nwe are  suggesting that the policy preferences of the US gov- \nernment influenced the technical appra~sa l  of the cornme- \n. A \nhensive approach-and this spilled over into ~ t s  representa- \ntion of GWPs. But this does not mean that the climate policy \nspec~alists within the administrat~on deliberately mis-repre- \nsented GWPs: rather that they used the flexibility in the tech- \nnical assessment of GWPs in their support. Evidence of the \nUS government's optimistic outlook comes from various gov- \nernment publications. A major report from 1991 stated that. \n'Although these uncertainties remaln In the GWP values, the \nconsensus of the IPCC was that the scientific method of cal- \nculating GWPs is sufficiently sound to permit its use. Simi- \nlarly, an  international workshop on GWP indices organised \nby NOAA. EPA, NASA. UKDOE, and others in Boulder. Col- \norado, in November 1990, concluded that though these un- \ncertainties require urgent attention, they do  not undermine \nthe s c ~ e n t ~ f i c  fundamentals of the GWP index and do  not \nwarrant abandoning it. . A good but imperfect index could \nserve well and then be amended later when knowledge im- \nproves' (Task Force 1991. p 23). This IS only one interpreta- \ntion of the Boulder meeting, however, slnce the official report \ncan also be read a s  a detailed 1s t  of numerous uncertainties \nin the calculation and interpretation of GWPs (Workshop \n1991) \n6This is clear from a statement made by John Sununu, Presi- \ndent Bush's Chief of Staff from 1989 till 1992, in an  interview \nfor Technology Review. 'There is a n  effort to focus only on \ncarbon d ~ o x ~ d e  emissions, and I t h ~ n k  that's because carbon \ndioxlde is v~rtually a surrogate for economic growth and de -  \nvelopment. There's opposition to ~lnposing limits on a more \ncomprehensive basis, because you don't slow growth and de -  \nvelopment down as  much by limiting emissions of other \ngreenhouse gases like methane and nitrogen oxides' (Su- \nnunu 1992) \n98 Clim Res 8: 89-106, 1997 \nof that policy. This political preference serves to illus- \ntrate the significance of the flexible definition of GWPs \nin practical policy contexts. None of this is to suggest \ndeliberate manipulation on the part of scientists or \npolicy makers, however. At least one of the authors of \nthe above-mentioned U S  government report knew \nwell, for example, the difference between measures of \nforcing and of response. And yet the ambiguous state- \nment appears in the report, not because of any con- \nspiracy to mislead policy makers, but because it was \nthat scientific interpretation which most nearly dove- \ntailed with the surrounding policy ambitions in the US \nadministration. \nThe uncertainties and scientific debates surrounding \nGWPs are,  according to Victor, not generally recog- \nnised by the policy community and user groups who \nconsider them to be key policy instruments (pers. \ncomm. 23 July 1996), a point confirmed by evidence of \nhow policy analysts from other fields have used GWPs \nuncritically (e.g. Wade et al. 1993).' The lack of knowl- \nedge amongst the policy community of the technical \nambiguity of GWPs is likely to be important in sustain- \ning their belief in GWPs, and indirectly perhaps also in \nsome of the political programmes GWPs lend support \nto. In other words, if the ambiguity of GWPs were \nwidely known about amongst the policy community it \nis likely that scepticism over their anticipated use \nwould be greater and support for the comprehensive \napproach might be tempered with some reservations \nas to its practicality. The research and advisory scien- \ntists are themselves more aware of the ambiguity but \nnot usually to the extent that is documented here \nbecause they tend to be working from a relatively \nrestricted viewpoint (as discussed in the next section). \nThey are also unaware of the role that ambiguity in the \nscience plays in sustaining particular policy options, \nbecause they tend to perceive of science and policy as \nrather sharply d~stinct and 'stand-alone'. \nAt a more general level, there is ambiguity concern- \ning whether GWPs are primarily tools for policy of little \nuse to scientists, as  Bert Bolin presented them at WGJ \n93, or whether, as other IPCC contributors have \nclaimed, GWPs have stimulated research, and led to \ni.dentification of new priorities in, scientific work Most \nobviously, calculating GWPs required further develop- \nment of models (e.g. for cycles of GHGs) which in turn \nraised questions for more basic research. One partici- \npant commented that: \n7GWPs are also sometimes quoted In policy and discuss~on \ndocuments without specify~ny the tlme horizon used. Exam- \nples Include a n  analysis from the US Department of State \n(1992) and a book on global environmental policy issues by \na well-known political scientist (Skolnikoff 1993: p 182) \nIn a sense requesting a GWP (for a particular gas] is \ngiving a challenge to that particular reseclrch community. \nI mean, they didn't realise how important i t  was for them \nto understand the significance of the carbon cycle, and to \ndetermine the average lifetime of a CO, molecule. . So, \nfor example, when you look at their models it is very clear \nthat they are actually giving a different lifetime to normal \nCO:, than they attribute to the radioactive CO2 produced \nin the nuclear weapons test. And you say to them, 'well \nwhy is this?', and they say, 'well there are very good rea- \nsons why this I S ' ,  but they haven't actually worked them \nthrough. The two communities have just gone off, deal- \ning with the same molecule but having different life- \ntimes, and there was no attempt for the two communities \nto get together. ... they realised that this meant they had \nto give a different lifetime to the CO, from deforestation \nthan to the man-made COz. So they thought at that stage. \nwe really should get to the bottom of this. \n(interview with S.S., atmospheric chemist, 5 April 1993) \nHence GWPs may have unintentionally directed pol- \nicy for science by presenting new research questions \nand a concrete basis for interaction between re- \nsearchers. The inconsistencies between the working \nassumptions and rules-of-thumb for different scientific \nsub-disciplines are highlighted by the needs of a fur- \nther group representing policy makers-the IPCC. We \ncan now add a fourth role for GWPs, that as  a heuristic \ndevice for pursuing further research questions. This \nmultiplicity of roles constitutes further flexibility in the \nassessment criteria for evaluating GWPs. \n3.2. An interpretation of the role of ambiguity \nRather than the 'multivalency' of GWPs being a \nsource of weakness, it may facilitate the involvement \nof a range of interested parties in their further devel- \nopment and use, including scientists, policy makers \nand analysts, industry and environmental groups (cf. \nSingleton & Michael 1993). Several political scientists \nand sociologists have recently argued that loose co- \nalitions or alliances between a range of policy actors \nand knowledge-producers around a common under- \nstanding of and orientation to, a problem and suitable \nsolutions are  highly important in mobilising resources \nand effective policy actions to address those issues \n(Sabatier 1987, Haas 1989, 1992, Star & Greisemer \n1989, Hajer 1995). In this context, the ambiguity of \nGWPs is perhaps a resource for different scientific and \npolicy actors to draw upon in developing and sustain- \ning scientific and policy agendas. There are after all \nmajor questions and uncertainties surrounding how to \nfurther the FCCC, as a result of w h ~ c h  it is not possible \nfor scientists or policy makers to know just how GWPs \nwill be used in policy, hence exactly what is required of \nthem. In such a situation, an ambiguous, hence flexi- \nble, identity is possibly a useful resource since it pro- \nShackley & Wynne: Global Warming Potentlals and policy 99 \nvides the opportunity for fulf~lling different potential \narticulations of the relation of science and policy in the \nclimate change domain, and satisfying different agen- \ndas. An over-stabilisation of GWPs at  this stage, in \nterms of pinning down its precise meaning and use, \ncould therefore risk it becoming over-brittle and con- \nstraining to scientists and policy actors whose agendas \nand requirements for GWPs subsequently change. \nSuch over-stabilised GWPs would be much less likely \nto be accepted by policy makers \nThe ambiguity also works to the advantage of \nresearch scientists, in terms of providing them with a \nrationale for further research and interesting questions \nto address. If leading research scientists were not \ninvolved in developing GWPs, the scientific creden- \ntials of GWPs would surely be questioned. The \ndemands of policy makers go only so far in explaining \nhow and why research scientists undertake original \nwork necessary to the formulation of GWPs (since the \nresearch community still has some autonomy, includ- \ning its own peer-review processes). A further require- \nment for an ambiguous identity for GWPs is, therefore, \nthat it permits the pursuit of interesting basic research \nquestions. For C-cycle, and other GHG-cycle, mod- \nellers, for example, GWPs are  an  opportunity to pursue \ninteresting research issues (e.g. why are the life-times \nof \"C, I3C and I4C different?). \nThe calculation of a new GWP for methane in 1993\/4 \nraised very basic research questions and cutting-edge \natmospheric chemistry models were employed. Simi- \nlarly, experts in radiative forcing and other aspects of \natmospheric chemistry, as well as economists and \nother soclal scientists, can all pursue major new re- \nsearch questions through their involvement in devel- \noping GWPs. Then there are the diverse research com- \nmunities with an  interest in measuring and monitoring \ngreenhouse gas emissions and in developing invento- \nries, and\/or who are adapting their research in the \nlight of these new needs; this includes, amongst others, \nspecialists in agricultural, animal husbandry and land- \nuse practices, researchers in the energy field, air pollu- \ntion specialists, and so on. \nMeanwhile for advisory scientists at the IPCC, GWPs \nare a means of distilling a huge amount of scientific \nknowledge into a simple 'black-boxed' method for pol- \nicy makers. Each of the terms in the equation to calcu- \nlate GWPs is a scientific judgement which draws upon \nvast areas of research. Chapter 5 of IPCC94 on GWPs \nis in many senses the summation and integration of the \ndetailed knowledge in the 4 antecedent chapters into \nmore policy-useful knowledge. GWPs therefore also \nprovide some justification for the development and use \nof highly complex models: in particular, radiative mod- \nels, carbon-cycle and other GHG-cycle models and \natmospheric chemistry models. It is highly important in \nthe present context that science funded for policy rea- \nsons is seen to benefit policy makers. \nFor policy makers, GWPs are  seemingly a cheap and \naccessible tool to devise 'optimal' climate change poli- \ncies. In principle, they permit involvement of a wider \ngroup of national experts than is typically the case \nwhen GCMs and carbon-cycle models are the princi- \npal sources of knowledge. They promise to be useful \ntools to 'bridge' the gulf between the complexities of \nGCMs and policy issues arising from the FCCC, espe- \ncially the commitment to a comprehensive approach. \nAt the same time, GWPs do not constrain the policy \nmaker to the extent that 'control' is wrested away from \nthem by scientists. \nThe variable time-horizons for which GWPs can be \ncalculated is also useful for policy makers. That it \nobscures the focus on a particular time period, system \nor region is a n  important way in which a global con- \nsensus on the impact or damage from climate change \ncan emerge. At the same time, its potential incorpora- \ntion of many different time horizons permits scientists \nto take into account variable impacts on different time- \nscales. Imprecision here is a key resource, not a hin- \ndrance. Variable time horizons in calculating GWPs \nmight also permit greater flexibility for monitoring and \npresenting progress towards the achievement of seem- \ningly rigid emission reduction  target^.^ \nThis need for flexibility and ambiguity may also \nexplain why the moves towards making GWPs more \ncomprehensive have not been strongly supported by \nadvisory scientists or indeed policy makers. A more \ncomplete index, whilst objectively more 'rational' and \npolicy-relevant, may be  less desirable because it is \nmore precisely defined a n d  less flexible a s  to how it \ncan be interpreted and used (as well as opening up \nmore opportunities for criticism, through the wider set \nof knowledges and uncertainties entailed in creating \na more complete index). Although it may appear curi- \nous that 'practical knowledge' is less specific and less \nuseful in an  instrumental fashion, it is more under- \nstandable when the multlple roles of knowledge in \npolicy are recognised (cf. Stehr 1992). To have an  \neffective interactional and  heuristic role, GWPs need \nto be flexible, whilst the symbolic role can still func- \ntion a s  long as  there is a low-level common definition. \nOur analytical approach, therefore, has been to iden- \ntify what each scientific or policy community involved \n'A counter-example is ODPs, which were integrated to \nsteady-state. It has been suggested that their lack of varying \ntime horizons was one reason why chlorine-loading poten- \ntials (CLPs) replaced ODPs as  the predominant comparative \npolicy tool, hence suggesting the policy-s~gnificance of some \nopen-endedness over the time-scale of analysis \nClim Res 8: 89-106, 1997 \nin GWPs has to 'gain' from that involvement. The \ndiversity of sought-for aims, ambitions and uses- \nfrom negotiators, government officials, advisory scien- \ntists, research scientists, environmentalists, and so \nforth-makes a flexible, ambiguous identity of GWPs \na requisite feature. That flexibility cannot be infinite, \nhowever; there must be a 'lowest common denomina- \ntor' meaning given to GWPs across all the diverse \ngroups involved in their construction and use if a rea- \nsonably coherent community is to emerge around \nGWPs. \n4. IMPLICIT SOCIAL AND POLICY \nCOMMITMENTS INCLUDED IN DISCUSSIONS \nOVER THE POLICY USE OF GWPs \nIn this section we explore how discussions between \nscientists and policy makers frequently include implicit \nsocial and policy assumptions, beliefs and commit- \nments. In its 1994 report, the IPCC itself acknowledged \nthe role of policy In constructing GWPs: \nA relative radlatlve forc~ng index is not purely a geo- \nphysical quantity, such as is a change of temperature. \nRather, these indices are user-oriented constructs whose \ncalculation involves not only an understanding of a few \nrelevant Earth-system processes (e.g., radiative transfer \nand chemical removal), but also some policy-oriented \ncho~ces (e.g., a selection of the time span of ~nterest).  \nHence, such indices per se are not subject to observation \nand testing in the sense of many climate-system predic- \ntions, but are best judged by ( i )  their representativeness \nof the overall radiative forcing role of the specified trace \ngas and (il) their overall usefulness to those who formu- \nlate and establish pollc~es regarding the greenhouse \ngases. \n(IPCC 1994: p 212) \nThe IPCC is referring in the above quote to deliber- \nate choices made by policy actors, whereas here we \nare additionally alluding to implicit commitments and \nassumptions, which are not explicitly chosen through \nconscious debate. No one deliberately chose that \nGWPs would have an ambiguous identity, for example, \nor that they would have important symbolic and inter- \nactional roles. These features arose through social (and \npolitical) processes and negotiation, but are neverthe- \nless major elements in understanding the continued \nresilience of GWPs. We present several illustrative \nexamples of implicit, and sometimes explicit, beliefs \nand commitments, drawing upon detailed observation \nby the first author of 3 IPCC Working Group I meetings \n[a planning meeting in February 1993 (WGI 93), a \nmeeting of the lead authors in July 1994 [WGI 94A), \nand the Plenary of WGI held in September 1994 (WGI \n94B)l. \n4.1. Time horizons for GWPs: between flexibility and \ncontrol \nAlthough WGI 93 endorsed the role and relevance of \nGWPs, there were a few dissenting voices. As one sci- \nentist (who we call scientist 1) put it in a note circulated \nat the meeting: \nWe need to decide whether we wish to emphasise the \nclear and large contribution of CO,  (and CH,) to the \nhistorical greenhouse forclng or risk a protracted and \ndifficult-to-resolve debate on the technicalities of GWP \ncalculation Although we have presented three time \nhorizons to cover these problems, my experience is that \nthey tend to be misused or even abused. Industries tend \nto pick the horizon that puts thelr 'product' in the best \nlight. \nEvidence to support scientist 1 emerged later that \nyear in the UK following an advertisement, placed by \nthe chemical company ICI, for Klea-134a, an HFC \nreplacement of CFCs, in the House of Parliament's \nmagazine The House. It claimed that the direct green- \nhouse warming of Klea is 90% less than the CFC it \nreplaces (Greenpeace 1993). ICI failed to indicate the \ntime horizon over which the direct GWP for Klea was \ncalculated, this being 500 yr. If a shorter time horizon \nof 100 years was used Klea has a GWP which is 17 % of \nCFC-12, going up to 44 % if the time horizon is reduced \nto 20 years. The environmental group Greenpeace \ntook the case to the UK's Advertising Standards \nAuthority (ASA), who decided not to uphold this par- \nticular complaint, arguing that: \nwh~le  the copy would have benefited from an explicit \nindication of the timescale used, readers would have \nviewed the claim in the context of long-term rather than \nshort-term global warming and that ~t was therefore \nacceptable. \n(in Greenpeace 1993) \nGreenpeace responded to this by pointing out that \nthe Climate Convention referred to limiting climate \nchange over a time scale of decades rather than hun- \ndreds of years; they questioned the policy usefulness of \na long time horizon for calculating GWPs, claiming \nthat: '500 years is simply not a timescale that humans \ninstinctively regard as useful' (ibid.). The ASA replled \nto Greenpeace that: 'the long term would seem to us to \nbe equally important and we remain of the view that \nan unqualified claim will be interpreted as reflecting \nthe long term situation' (ibid.). Many policy analysts \nand scientists who quote GWPs, however, now rou- \ntinely use the value as calculated over a 100 yr time- \nframe. In discussions at the WGI 93 meeting there was \na consensus that the 500 yr horizon was far too long for \ncalculating reliable GWPs-the idea was described by \nShackley & \\nl)lnne Globdl W a r m i n g  Potentials a n d  policy \none participant as 'ridiculous'; by contrast: 'we can \nproduce a single set of numbers applicable to anything \nwhich might happen in the next 100 years'. The scien- \ntists at the IPCC in 1993\/4 combined judgements about \nthe scientific feasibility of calc.ulating reliable GWPs \nwith judgements about what were policy-relevant time \nhorizons, coming up with a 100 yr frame as probably \nmost appropriate. \nThe ICVGreenpeace example seems to support sci- \nentist l ' s  argument that the variable time horizons for \ncalculating GWPs could become a recipe for endless, \nirresolvable and politically motivated arguments about \nwhat is a policy-useful time frame and what knowl- \nedge can be assumed on the part of policy makers. The \nabihty to use GWPs over different time frames and pre- \nsent them to other audiences as the same calculation \ncould be seen as an  unwelcome feature of their flexi- \nbility which had not been fully appreciated by IPCC \nscientists when they introduced the time horizons. The \n3 time horizons, whilst according to the IPCC without \n'special significance', gained credence amongst out- \nsiders as indicatives of the short, medium and long \nterm. For example, 500 yr became, for the ASA, 'the \nlong term'. \nOne participant at  the WGI 93 meeting suggested \nthat the policy use of GWPs would be helped by clearly \nlabelling GWPs according to their time horizons, i.e. \nGWPlo would be a GWP calculated for 10 yr, GWPSOfor \n50 y r  and so on. The idea was rapidly taken up by the \nparticipants. If users could be persuaded to always \nlabel their GWPs in this way, and if that label were \nwidely understood and even required as a matter of \ncourse, greater control by the IPCC over the conditions \nof use of GWPs could thereby be achieved. WGI's solu- \ntion implied a 'use\/abuse' model of science in policy \nmaking; abuse which could be tackled by ~mposing a \nnew mode of contl-01 which did not, however, detract \nfrom the essential simplicity, hence usefulness, of the \nconcept. However, the idea vanished without comment \nor explanation at subsequent WGI meetings. A likely \nexplanation is that such a level of control over GWPs \nwould not have been welcomed by policy makers: \nbecause it would reduce their flexibility in the uptake \nand use of GWPs. \n4.2. Spatial and temporal variability of forcing \nconcentrated in the industrial zones. The rejoinder to \nthis, from scientist 3,  was that the sources of CFCs are \nabout as regional as for sulphate, yet GWPs are calcu- \nlated for CFCs. \nScientist 4 ,  in response to scientist 2 ,  noted that since \nCWPs aim to represent global damage,  the spatial or \ntemporal variability of forcing was irrelevant. In other \nwords, the forcing might be greater in some parts of the \natmosphere than in others, but the climatic conse- \nquences would still be globally distributed. Scientist 2 \nreplied to this by pointing out that even if  you had the \nsame GWP values for CO2 and sulphate, they would not \nnecessarily compensate each other because the forcing \nvaries spatially. Thus the compensation would be  \ngreater in the North Hemisphere than in the South with \nconsequent differences in damage done, but consid- \nered globally such differences would even out, giving a \nfalse indication of climatic change in terms of broad re- \ngional effects (and, given non-linearities, perhaps in its \nabsolute extent). Scientist 5 then suggested that the \nword 'damage' should not be used by WGI at all since it \n'depends on where you live in the world' He  further \nthought that WGI 'should not get  into this at  all'. \nDiscussion of the regional impacts and damages of \nclimate change were directly invoked during WGI 93's \ndebate over GWPs. But these debates did not lead to \nthe conclusion that regional warming potentials should \nbe calculated to assist policymaking in those circum- \nstances where global-scale assessment was not robust. \nThe reason for this appears to have been the strong \nemphasis placed at  WGI 93 by the chairman of the \nIPCC WGI and  Bert Bolin (the overall chairman of the \nIPCC) on the definition of the enhanced greenhouse \neffect as a global-level problem, which requires \nglobal-level analysis and solutions. Rather than re- \ngional warming potentials, various solutions were \nsuggested to maintain the global-scale focus of GWPs: \nfor example, defining the spatial heterogeneity of \nsulphate-aerosol-induced climate change as  a policy \nissue rather than as science (even though heterogene- \nity on the part of CFCs was not similarly treated as a \npolicy issue); including additional uncertainty bounds \nbecause of the regional effects; and ruling out GWPs for \nshort-lived or highly spatially variable gases. We sug- \ngest that the social and  policy commitment to global- \nlevel analysis was a prominent factor in the design and \nrepresentation of GWPs a t  WGI of the lPCC, and con- \ntributed to the lack of discussion of alternative indices. \n4.3. A new GWP for methane \nA further issue discussed at  WGI 93 was whether \nGWPs could be calculated for gases which illustrate a \nhigh degree of regional variability (such as the CFCs) \nor for the sulphate aerosols, which have negative forc- \ning as well as spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Sci- A new GWP for methane was suggested in IPCC94, \nentist 2 argued against including sulphate aerosols to take account of the effect of methane on its own life- \nbecause its sources are  far from global, being largely time and  its indirect effects. Calculation of this new \nClim Res 8: 89-106. 1997 \nvalue was performed by 2 or 3 scientists using 3- \ndimensional atmospheric chemistry models (the only \nsuitable ones available). Since the different models did \nnot produce the same precise values for different \ndirect and indirect effects, and  given that there was \nno obvious way of choosing one model result over \nanother, the final values used, and the associated un- \ncertainty ranges, were agreed through a process of \nnegotiation between the modellers. \nAt the subsequent Plenary Meeting-WGT 94B- \nwhen the Policy Makers Summary was officially \nendorsed by national representatives, one country's \nofficial raised the issue of how to represent the new \nGWP for methane. This official, who was a scientist, \nwas concerned with the implications of the proposed \npresentation of the GWP for methane as a single figure \n(for a particular time horizon) with a n  uncertainty \nrange of +35%. The danger, given the new GWP for \nmethane, was that governments would be  tempted to \ntrade-off reductions in CH4 for increases in other \ngreenhouse gases, such as COz. The issue is illustrated \nwell by Fuglestvedt & Skodvin (1996) who show that \nthe total GHG emissions for New Zealand (as CO2 \nequivalents) increase by 300 % when GWPs are  calcu- \nlated using a 20 yr rather than a 500 yr integration, \nwhereas for Norway there is relatively little change \n(Fuglestvedt & Skodvin 1996: p 75-80). This is because \nmethane is the dominant GHG for New Zealand for the \n20 yr time horizon, but if a 500 yr time horizon is used, \nCO2 dominates (and the contribution of methane is \nreduced from 75 '% to 28 9'0). \nThe government official at  WGI 94B wanted a clearer \nstatement of the wider uncertainties and some state- \nment to the effect that there is too much uncertainty at- \ntached to GWPs for them to be  used to justify off-setting \nbetween greenhouse gases. The involvement at  this \nstage of government scientists from countries with par- \nticular greenhouse gas emission patterns introduced \nnew ideas about how uncertainty should be repre- \nsented, including whether there should be some indica- \ntion of the (in)appropriate policy use of GWPs. This sort \nof position is very similar to scientist l ' s  stance, dis- \ncussed above, in that it shares a sim.ilar perception of \nhow science is typically open to abuse by self-inter- \nested parties in policy making, i.e. its uncertainties will \nbe treated as a resource in pursuing a political stance. \nOther influential scientists and policy makers at  WGI \n94B resisted changing the representation of uncer- \ntainty. They argued that it was not for the WGI to tell \npolicy makers how to use GWPs and that this would \nappear a s  WGI claiming greater knowledge about pol- \nicy making than that held by the policy makers them- \nselves. Some mentioned the analogy of Ozone Deple- \ntion Potentials (ODPs), and in the 1994 report this \ncomparison was developed a t  some length in a section \nentitled 'The Insights Gained From Ozone Depleting \nPotentials'. There it states that: 'The Legal Drafting \nGroup that wrote the final text of the Protocol required \nthat single values be stated for the ODPs, despite the \nfact that a scientific estimate always has some level of \nuncertainty and hence a numerical range within which \nthe ODP is ltkely to he' (IPCC 1994: p 228). \nThe WGI's expliclt comparison with ODPs is instruc- \ntive given the considerable overlap between advisory \nscientists on the WMO's ozone assessment panel and \nthe IPCC WGI. It reveals much about the way in which \nthese advisory scientists conceived of their relationship \nto policy. For example, that advisory scientists acceded \nto the policy makers' request for a single ODP value, \nwhilst an  understandable response, could nevertheless \nbe seen as misleading from a scientific perspective. \nThe advisory scientists' own extrapolation from the \nozone to the climate change case of what policy mak- \ners a re  likely to 'need' by way of knowledge may also \ncome to have a decisive influence on policy makers' \nown perceptions of what knowledge they need and \ncan reasonably expect. That is, policy makers may \nlegitimately conclude from the presentation of a single \nvalue by advisory scientists that they do not need to \ngrapple with the issue of scientific uncertainty as \nexpressed in a range of values. \nThe case of the GWP for methane indicates the fuzzy \ncharacter of the boundary between science and policy. \nHow policy makers defined science and policy in the \nrelated case of ODPs was used by advisory scientists as \na guide to distinguish science from policy in the case of \nGWPs. This is a n  understandable response, but never- \ntheless reinforces uncritically the idea that policy mak- \ners are  unable to cope with more than a modicum of \nscientific uncertainty, and will not accept a range of \nfigures. Such models of policy are  rarely traceable to \nspecific policy makers or policy commitments, but \nseem more the result of shared assumptions or implicit \ncommitments of the proto-community of climate \nchange policymaking, to which advisory scientists \nhave become wedded. \n5. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS \nGWPs have a flexible, ambiguous meaning which \nassists in their continued development through nurtur- \ning interactions between research and advisory scien- \ntists, policy makers, environmentalists, industrialists \nand other interested parties. We have identified 4 roles \nfor GWPs-instrumental, symbolic, heuristic and \ninteractional-which contribute to the maintenance of \na flexible interpretation and meaning. Th.e way GWPs \nare  discussed tends to incorporate assumptions about \nthe social and policy context of their expected use.g \nShackley & Wynne: Global Warmlng Potentials and policy 103 \nEven the 'lowest common denominator' identity \nimplies belief in analysing and tackling global warm- \ning, through GHG emission reductions, at  the global \nlevel (and despite technical and policy arguments for a \nregional analysis and policy response). The commit- \nment on the part of many advisory sc~entists to a global \nanalysis and solution appears to be motivated by 2 con- \nsiderations: firstly, the perceived tendency for interna- \ntional policy to become reduced to a contest between \nnational interests, and secondly, by the belief that \nnations will try and avoid their obligations whilst ben- \nefiting from the actions of others. (Any one nation \nstands to gain little, in terms of limiting climate change \nin its own region, from participating in greenhouse gas \nemission reductions, whilst gaining much from the \nactions of other nations.) Only a global solution, entail- \ning global-scale analysis and policy development, will, \nit is felt, overcome these parochial influences. But the \nglobal focus is also founded, we suggest, on the techni- \ncal judgement that a n  index at the global scale is more \nrobust and 'do-able' than a regional one. In a sense, \nthe policy and technical definitions of the problem and \nviable solutions converge at  the global-scale locus. \nThe discussions at  IPCC meetings illustrated 2 other \nsubstantive beliefs about policy. Firstly, in the ability of \nthe policy system to prevent misuse of the GWP con- \ncept from politically driven interest groups. This judge- \nment was arrived at by 'default', as an assumption of \nthe authoritative influence of science. Secondly, that \nadvisory scientists should use the policy makers' own \ndistinctions between science and policy when demar- \ncating the limits of their expertise (though we have \nobserved this in only one case). We are not criticising \nthese beliefs about policy per se. Our point is more \nabout the processes through which such beliefs \nemerge and are sustained. They are  not judgements \nwhich are openly debated amongst a wide section of \npolicy actors, but are instead assumed without much \nevidence of critical reflection by advisory scientists and \nsome policy makers. (This is not to deny the consider- \nable personal experience the latter groups bring to the \nIPCC, but rather an  acknowledgement that this does \nnot guarantee a sufficiently wide-ranging discussion.) \nAnd unexpected consequences flow from these judge- \nments: for example policy makers may take their cue \nfor locating the science\/policy boundary from advisory \n\"ictor has analysed in depth the political and administrative \nconditions which would need to be in place for GWPs to be \nused effechvely in climate policy maklng. He has found these \nconditions to be far removed from the current situation (Vic- \ntor 1990, 1991, Grubb e t  al. 1991, Victor & Salt 1995a, b). \nHence his analysis complements ours by illuminating addi- \ntional presumptions about the social and policy context in \nwhich GWPs will be used which a re  rarely acknowledged or \ncritically assessed \nscientists, not realising that the scientists have them- \nselves borrowed the policy makers own perceived dis- \ntinction between science and policy (as expressed \ninformally and in other policy fora). The scientists may \nthereby unintentionally reinforce the distinction be- \ntween science and policy made by pol~cy makers. \nBecause the science\/policy boundary IS always fuzzy, \nand subject to negotiation, uncritically reinforcing the \nprior assumption of policy makers runs the risk of c.ur- \ntailing creative thinking. Other lmpllcations in this \nvein are  presented in Box 1. \nThe focus on GWPs a t  the science-policy interface \nhas reinforced GHG emission reductions as the prime \nmeans of analysing and responding to climate change. \nAs Victor & Salt have put it: \nOp t~ons  for dealing with multiple gases without using the \nGWP concept have not been adequately reflected in the \ninternat~onal debate because analysts have focused on \nthe easlest measures (i.e. emissions) and then been \nforced to adopt some sort of conversion index (i.e. the \nGWP, usually with 100 year integration). With so much \nnow invested in emissions-oriented thinking and policy \nanalysis, it would be painful for many to explore the \nsevere problems with the GWP concept, which would \nrequire rethinking of the entire approach to slowing \nglobal warming. \n(Victor & Salt 1995b: p 34) \nTo put it another way: (1) GWPs are perceived as \nmore stable and robust by many policy actors than is \nthe specialist scientific perception; (2) partly as a con- \nsequence GWPs are  increasingly accepted as the most \nappropriate tool for comparing different GHGs in the \ncontext of the FCCC; (3) this approach to GWPs tends \nto reinforce a n  emphasis on emissions as the appropri- \na te  indicator by which to establish and define policy \ncommitments. A significant influence in this case \nappears to have been the perceived need of the main \nactors within the climate policy domain to reach an  \nagreement rather rapidly on how to codify new (i.e. \npost year 2000) commitments under the FCCC. GWPs \nare  one of the crutches which support the development \nof the FCCC in the manner preferred by the dominant \npolicy actors, whilst acquiring support themselves from \nthis important policy role. \nAlternative definitions of policy responses are  avail- \nable, including: calculating relative radiative forcing \nand codifying commitments in terms of allowable con- \ntributions over a particular period of time to global \nradiative forcing; producing economic welfare based \nindices; calculating equal financial shares towards \nsolving a common burden; and according a greater \nrole to deliberate adaptation (Victor pers. comm. 23 \nJuly 1996). It could even be  argued that a single, stan- \ndardised metric of global applicability such as  the \nGWP might come to inhibit nationally, regionally or \n104 Clim Res 8: 89-106, 1997 \n~ Box 1. Some implications for climate change science and policy arising from the GWPs case-study \n1 (1) Mutual reinforcement processes between science \nand policy tend to make certain opt~ons look more solidly \ngrounded in scientific analysis than is the case. Vigilance \nis needed to ensure that premature closure of policy \noptions \/ modes of scientific analysis does not occur. \nRecognition and discussion of the ambiguity and multiva- \nlency of scientific tools for policy in the public domain is \none way to stimulate debate which explores options other \nthan the dominant response \n(2) In some cases, scientific tools for policy cannot \nbecome too specific and precise, yet still remain robust in \nadvisory and policy circles, because they would lose \nmuch of their ability to interlink different research and \npolicy communities. Arguably, global climate change \npolicy is currently as much about forging new linkages \nbetween previously disparate groups, mstitutions, knowl- \nedges and techniques as it as about actual policy actions \nbeing decided and acted-upon now (i.e. inter- \nactional\/symbolic rather than instrumental rationality). \nSuch loose coalitions are critical in facilitating the wider \nacknowledgement and diffusion of the issue and build- \ning-up of trust and appropriate knowledge. Indices or \nlocally focused policy actions, or else actions focused \non different time horizons than the ones preferred in \ncalculating GWPs. Alternative indices may therefore \nneed to be more specifically tailored to a particular \ncontext of policy use. \nAmongst research and advisory scientists the ambi- \nguity of GWPs is more widely recognised, though most \nscientists are familiar with only some of those aspects \nmentioned in this paper since they are  typically inter- \nested in only part of the technical knowledge under- \npinning GWPs. Less familiar to scientists is the notion \nthat science for policy may contain implicit social and \npolicy beliefs, and that the preference for a particular \npolicy option may be founded in part on a misplaced \nconfidence on the part of decision makers in the \nunderpinning science. Some scientists are  likely to \nresist this notion since it may appear (falsely) as a chal- \nlenge to the autonomy or integrity of science, though \nall we are attempting to do is to promote a discussion \non what are appropriate and effective roles for science \nin policy. Ambiguity is commonly perceived by scien- \ntists as uncertainty which needs to be addressed by \nfurther research. They therefore tend to locate ambi- \nguity within their own specific research domain as \ntheir 'responsibility'. Ambiguity provides material for \nfurther research in the problem-solving mode. For this \nreason, scientists are unlikely to widely publicise to \npolicy makers the uncertainty and ambiguity over \nGWPs which emerges in their own specific domain. \nThis allows the key advisory scientists and\/or climate \npolicy specialists-who mediate between the research \ncommunity and policy makers-to connect the per- \nceived needs of policy (themselves uncertain) with that \nother tools for policy cannot be assessed therefore only in \ninstrumental terms (i .e.  concerning whether the particu- \nlar numerical values are rel~able and useful in specific \npolicy contexts). Uncertainty and instability in numerical \nvalues, or incompleteness, are then less significant in \nevaluating the usefulness of such a policy tool than is \ntypically assumed. \n(3) For this reason, an index or tool for policy which is \nmore comprehensive in the sense of including more \n'down-stream' variables will not necessarily be more \nacceptable or effective at the science-policy interface. \nConsensus may be easier to achieve for a scientific policy \ntool which is less ambitious and leaves more policy choices \nopen to future debate.'' \n( 4 )  As GWPs (and other tools) become used in specific, \npractical policy-making contexts, greater emphas~s will \nprobably be placed on instrumental utility with respect to \nthe policy context of use. At some stage, the ambiguity in \nidentity and interpretation may be insufficient to contain \nall the versions developed for detailed application, at \nwhich point break-away ind~ces or integrated assessments \nare probable. \ndefinition of GWPs which seems most relevant to those \nneeds, the result being that the science and policy \ndovetail snugly into one another. The specialist advi- \nsors are, quite reasonably, using the flexibility in the \nscientific definition of GWPs to find the most appropri- \nate role for science given signals from policy makers \nand politicians on the characteristics of a desirable pol- \nicy framework. In doing so, however, policy makers \nmight come to exaggerate the overall instrumental role \nof science and\/or of the feasibility of certain policy \napproaches (e.g. the comprehensive approach). \nGWPs are typically represented in IPCC reports as \nscience-based, objective, stable and value-neutral. \nTheir technical use in generating numbers directly \nuseful for policy is regarded as the end point of suc- \ncess, with little mention of the scientific, policy, politi- \ncal and administrative conditions influencing the use- \nfulness and uptake of GWPs.\" This presentation does \nnot assist in the development of robust climate change \nscience or policy because it does not reflect the real- \nworld debates between scientists and policy actors \nconcerning the development of a method for compar- \ning greenhouse gases and how this could be used in \n''Some confirming evidence includes: the preferred use of \nCLPs rather than ODPs in the policy assessment of ozone \ndepletion, this being a more up-stream measure around \nwh~ch scientific consensus was more readily achieved; and \nthe counter-example of the World Resource Institute's \nGreenhouse Index which was almost universally regarded \nnegatively because of its needed inclusion of relatively \ndown-stream policy and political ludgements about how to \nallocate responsibility for GHG emissions, though in a less \nthan fully transparent way (Hammond et al. 1990, 1991, \nAgarwal& Narain 1991, Overview 1991a, b) \nShackley & Wynne: Global Warming Potentials and pollcy 105 \nimplementing the FCCC, nor the non-obvious but \nimportant roles that GWPs come to play in policy \ndebates. It is our contention that were the ambiguity, \ninstability, multiple roles, controversy over, and hybrid \nfeatures of GWPs more widely known, a better overall \nrole for them in climate change policy would emerge. \nMore generally, recognition of the multiple roles of sci- \nence in policy may encourage reflection by advisory \nscientists and policy makers on the reasons why partic- \nular sorts of knowledge come to be important at the \nscience-policy interface and under what circum- \nstances, and hence permit a better overall assessment, \ndevelopment and application of such knowledge. The \nnext step is to further discuss what alternatives are \navailable or could be developed with respect to scien- \ntific tools for policy, policy commitments and ways of \nthinking. A related point, emerging from the role of \nscience in nurturing new communities, is to consider \nhow the social and policy coalitions centred around cli- \nmate change might become more socially inclusive \nand mobilise more political weight. \nCODA \nAs we were revising this paper, we received a draft \ncopy of a paper by Steven Smith and Tom Wigley (dated \n16 July 1996) in which the results of GWPs are  directly \ncompared with comparable calculations using a l - D  \nclimate model. They find that: ' ..the use of GWPs can re- \nsult in large and potentially serious errors, and we con- \nclude that GWPs should not be used for policy analysis'. \nIn the view of one of the scientists who developed GWPs, \nthe Smith\/Wigley paper 'nicely brings an end to the \nGWP saga'. As a result, scientific judgement may swing \naway from GWPs rather dramatically. It is fascinating to \nnote that this rigorous validation task for GWPs has only \nbeen conducted in 1996, more than 6 yr after GWPs be- \n\"The low-level. singular definition of GWPs is dependent on \nthe existence of multiple, diverse definitions. GWPs would \nrapidly lose all credibility as scientific or useful for policy \nwere the separate ambitions and work of the range of scien- \ntists, advisory scientists and policy makers to be overly con- \nstrained by a narrow definition of the GWP. Meanwhile, \nwithout the single, reduced version, the range of activities \nundertaken under the GWPs banner would lose much \nmeaning and there would be no similar currency for inter- \nnational policy and scientific discussions on how to compare \nGHGs (especially when planning the future trajectory of re- \nsearch and policy). The presentation of certain, quantitative \nGWPs in formal reports such as the IPCC's, whilst greatly \nreducing and simplifying the scientific complexities and as- \nsumptions, is acceptable to scientists only because of the ex- \nistence of an informal further level of understanding and ne- \ngotiation between scientists and policy makers on the \ninterpretation of the way in which scientific knowledge is \nused for specific policy decisions \ngan to be promoted. Some government departments \neven requested scientists to conduct similar validation \nexercises back in 1990. That this was not done is ex- \nplained, according to one advisory scientist, by the fact \nthat the research scientists were so busy developing and \ncalculating new GWP values that they did not have time \nto conduct proper validations tests for GWPs. If  a correct \ninterpretation, this is a vivid illustration of how perceived \npolicy pressures and needs come to construct scientific \ntools in a way which closes down reflexive debate and \nthorough validation. And note how this preoccupation of \nscientists with developing GWPs, rather than in their val- \nidation, could very easily be  interpreted by policy mak- \ners as evidence that GWPs have already been properly \nvalidated and hence that climate policy can be  devel- \noped in the confident knowledge that a robust tool exists \nfor comparing different GHGs. Pending further evi- \ndence, this is a n  excellent and  revealing illustration of \nthe mutual reinforcement of climate change science and \npolicy in the case of GWPs, which informs the theoretical \ncomponent of this paper. \nAcknowledgements.
