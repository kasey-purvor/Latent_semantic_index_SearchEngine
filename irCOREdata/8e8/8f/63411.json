IT can lead us away from the tyranny \nof older technology, but to find the right path, we need to understand our own \nlimitations. Language, images, data and mathematical models, are tools for expressing \nand recording our ideas. Backed by intuition, they enable us to think in various \nmodes, to build knowledge from information and create models as artificial views of a \nreal world. Markup languages may accommodate more flexible and better connected \nrecords, and the object-oriented approach may help to match IT more closely to our \nthought processes. \n \nKey Words - Thought processes, human communication, geoscience markup \nlanguage, object-oriented analysis. \n \n \n1. Communication at the interface \n \n1.1 Interwoven threads \n \nA great deal is lost when we force our thoughts into the straitjacket of shared \nconventional records (part I, section 6). Imagine yourself leading a geological field \nexcursion. You would certainly talk, producing strings of words - narrative \ndescriptions, accounts of sequences of events, reasoning and explanations. You would \nweave the ideas together to tell a story, probably supplementing the narrative with \ngestures, pointing to features of interest and drawing diagrams, perhaps with a stick in \nthe sand. You might look at detail with a hand lens, then stand back to see the wider \npicture. You might refer to recorded knowledge: \u201cI will read you a brief account of \nthe regional geology; you can see where we are on this map\u201d. You might pass on tacit \nknowledge by demonstration: \u201clook at the outcrop here and you will see what I \nmean\u201d. \n \nThe spatial context of your observations and hypotheses gives them coherence, but \nthe narrative is essential to tie the elements together. You might cope with leading a \nfield excursion with a broken arm, but would have problems if you lost your voice. \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part J  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nDifferent parts of the brain focus on different types of information, but given the \nopportunity, they work together for a clearer view of the big picture (or the big story). \n \nOur experiences may be single sequences of events, put in words as a narrative thread. \nRepetitive events, like seeing a similar sequence of beds again and again, merge into a \nsingle strand, with only exceptions (the fossiliferous bed) remembered separately. In \nour memories, the threads are woven together as a complex fabric. Our brains are \nconstantly trying to make sense of our experience by drawing analogies, abstracting \nand summarizing. The result is ideas with form and structure. We have each built our \nown background understanding or world view that provides the frames (K 1.2) in \nsemantic memory where we can accept and evaluate new ideas.  \n \nThe ability to integrate information types, so important in the field, is hampered by \nthe need to package recorded information in separate containers for narrative (books \nand reports), spatial information (maps), data (databases) and discourse (discussions). \nWe therefore need to look more closely at what we are trying to do and how we might \nprefer to do it. \n \nThree long-standing tools for sharing knowledge, as well as helping individuals to \ndevelop and organize their own thoughts, are language, image and demonstration. \nTwo more recent tools are mathematical methods and computer software. These tools \nshape the way we think and what we think about, as well as the way we perceive the \nworld. They correspond to different information types (text, spatial, tacit and \nstructured information) and lead to different styles of thought, presentation and \nprocessing procedures. The earlier techniques evolved so long ago that we have lost \nsight of their origin, but in planning for new technology we must bear in mind their \ncharacteristics. The Encyclopedia Britannica (1973, Language) is as always helpful \non such matters. \n \n1.2 Language and narrative \n \nLong ago and far away, our ancestors grunted and made noises, and then sequences of \ngrunts, ascribed meaning to them, and evolved a living language - a sequence of \ntokens denoting objects, actions and agents. At a similarly primitive level, our \nancestors looked around them, scratched maps on the sand, drew pictures on the cave \nwalls. Spoken language could be used for discussion and command. It was a means of \ncommunicating to a group, for the speaker could broadcast the same message to all \nwithin earshot. Images were at first a secondary, more personal communication, \ndirected to a select few, and requiring special skills even to draw crude sketches. But \nsuppose early man could have broadcast not just to the ears but also to the eyes of his \ncolleagues, with the ability to capture, record and communicate images in full detail \nto one and all. Methods of communication would surely have evolved differently. \nThat power, denied to our forebears, is now available to us. Does it make a \ndifference? Has an optimal system evolved naturally, or are we constrained by \nhistorical accidents? \n \nLeatherdale (1974) pointed out that sixteenth-century philosophers assumed that, in \nexperience, we always encounter well-defined or discrete \u201cthings\u201d, and that they \nseemed to conceive of the business of language as the adroit matching of words to \nthese separately given things of which they are the mark or sign.  The more recent \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part J  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nview is that language can be explained in terms of socially agreed understanding of \nwords: not on any intrinsic connection between signs and the world, as that would \nimply absolute properties of language independent of human culture.  Contexts need \nto be invented, and stories created, to make a character string meaningful (Laszlo, \n1972). \n \nIn evolutionary terms, episodic memory (I 4) presumably developed as a means of \nlearning from one\u2019s own experiences - a single thread of events winding through the \ncontinuum of space along the arrow of time. Language matches this pattern of thought \nwith linear strings of words and sentences, referring to past, present and future. \nNarrative skills evolved to create stories as surrogates for experience, told, retold and \nremembered (inaccurately). The story that began as a surrogate experience may by \nconstant reworking acquire the mythic quality of a folk tale. It generalizes by pulling \nout crucial, illuminating events, implying much more than it states by reacting with \nexisting ideas in the listeners\u2019 minds and influencing their semantic memories. \n \nFrom speech, written language evolved to reach a multitude of users separated in \nspace and time. External representation of knowledge (outside the human mind), for \nexample by writing and drawing, goes far beyond the here-and-now of story telling.  \nScientists, in building their knowledge base, are not limited to their own episodic \nmemory. They can contribute to and access a vast repository of information.  They \ncan do so at a time and place of their choosing, examining a wide range of specialized \nsources, past and present, in summary and in detail.   \n \nFaced with the infinite complexity of the real world, a complete description of it is \nunthinkable. Instead, stories are told in innumerable ways, to illustrate a multitude of \nexperiences from personal viewpoints. Yet, since they deal with the same reality, all \nrefer in a sense to the same underlying story. Because the overall story is large and \ncomplex, scientists must specialize in subdisciplines. A major part of story telling, or \nscientific writing, is therefore devoted to linking to earlier accounts, establishing \ncommon ground, clarifying, reconciling inconsistencies, and noting new information, \ndiscrepancies and ways to resolve them. Discourse, that is, the expression and \ninterchange of ideas, is the means of clarifying and reconciling the accounts, by \ndiscussion within a workgroup, or through the slow process of conventional \npublication. \n \n1.3 Spatial concepts \n \nWe can describe spatial pattern and relationships, rather inadequately, in ordinary \nlanguage such as: \u201cfilling broad channels from a northerly direction which were later \nburied to a great depth.\u201d However, evolution provided us with specific abilities to \nhandle and memorize spatial data (McCrone, 1999). Spatial skills bring evolutionary \nadvantages in catching things, or not bumping into them, as in swinging from tree to \ntree, where (with luck) the main sensory input is by eye. We can communicate exact \nand accurate spatial information as images (representations of the semblance or \nlikeness of an object), such as diagrams, sketches, maps, photographs and video clips, \nwhich make use of these skills. Note, however, that losing ambiguity is not always \nhelpful. If we depict the channels described at the start of this paragraph on a map, \nthey either join up in one direction or the other, or both, or not at all. This might bring \nunwanted connotations of tributaries, deltas, braided streams or whatever. The \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part J  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nambiguous statement may reflect genuine ignorance. The graphical representation can \nforce an appearance of certainty that does not reflect the real situation. \n \nUnlike narrative that places events in sequences of single threads, spatial thinking lets \nus build extensive structures, such as geological maps and cross-sections, that give a \ncomprehensive view over space and maybe geologic time. We can zoom in to see the \ndetail, zoom out to see the spatial context, pan around to see the situation elsewhere, \nand compare spatial patterns arising from different topics. Narrative text cannot offer \nthese abilities, but can be intimately linked to a spatial representation.  \n \nWe can represent spatial forms by combinations of geometrical objects, such as \npoints, lines, areas, surfaces, fields and volumes, with well-defined mathematical \nproperties. They can therefore be handled precisely on the computer. Within this \nrigorous framework, we can assemble spatial objects drawn from a wide range of \ntopics, say, topography, borehole records, formation boundaries, lithologies, \nengineering geology, planning zones and proposed construction sites, and process \nthem together. We can visualize the location, spatial patterns and relationships of sets \nof objects using interactive computer displays that take advantage of our spatial skills \nand the accuracy of human short-term memory. Our visual systems have evolved to \nprocess moving images, helping gannets to catch fish and motorists not to collide. \nComputers can exploit this talent, helping us to visualize changing spatial patterns, \nlike the development of a sedimentary basin.  \n \n1.4 Structured data \n \nMuch more recently than language and images, another type of knowledge \nrepresentation was invented, namely, numerical measurement and quantitative \nmodeling (F 1). An advantage of numbers is their ability to define relative magnitudes \nas precisely as required. The eye is adept at comparing two magnitudes, for instance \nthe relative sizes of two fossil specimens seen side by side. It is much less skilled at \ncomparing objects seen in different places or at different times. Measurement against \na standard scale uses the numerical series, the most exact order we can form. It \nprovides the portable yardstick that makes it possible to assemble any number of side-\nby-side comparisons as well as comparing the magnitudes as a group and examining \nsubtle variations in space or time (also measured numerically).   \n \nMathematical models (F 5) build on this ability of numbers to represent magnitude, \nand on the similarities between mathematical operations and physical processes. Sets \nof measurements and relationships between them can be summarized, properties can \nbe sampled to represent the underlying situation, uncertainty can be measured, states \ncan be compared and processes simulated. Practical applications in geoscience, \nincluding the quantitative description of spatial data and analysis of images, depend \nlargely on computer support, and a computer program is a precise and convenient \nmeans of sharing the model.  \n \nMathematical and spatial models (along with the data collected to investigate them) \nare both analogies (J 2.3) between the real world and the properties of numbers. \nQuantitative properties and relationships can be visualized as patterns in space. The \nmap can also be seen as a means of visualization (MacEachern, 1998). We can thus \nbring quantitative and cartographic methods into a single numeric framework. Both \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part J  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nanalogies are at best fuzzy approximations to the real world, despite the exact \nmathematics of the internal reasoning.  \n \nThe standards, rules and conventions of the more highly structured areas of the \ninformation repository add value by creating a coherent and easily accessible \ndatabase, possibly derived from many independent sources. All are ultimately set \nwithin text narratives, which explain the objectives, the conventions, the reasoning \nand the conclusions. Detailed narrative threads may refer to quite specific spatial \nitems or aspects of spatial and quantitative models. The reader should be able to view \nthe relevant items highlighted against their spatial context, and be able to move freely \nbetween the narrative and the visualization. \n \n1.5 Tacit knowledge \n \nPerhaps the greatest amount of geological information is held, not in the written \nrecord, but in total in the minds of all geologists. The geologist who has surveyed an \narea develops a mental picture of the geology more complete than that shown on maps \nand described in papers. Much is tacit knowledge which is acquired through practice \nand cannot be articulated explicitly (Kuhn, 1962) - known but not expressed. For \nexample, you might instantly recognize a specimen which you could not identify from \nthe most exhaustive description, just as you learned to ride a bicycle by demonstration \n(transferring knowledge held in procedural memory), not by written instruction. In a \ndiscussion, or a field excursion, much can be learned that could never be written \ndown. The importance of tacit knowledge means that education, training and learning \nthroughout a scientist's career need demonstration, discussion and directed experience \n- to communicate what we cannot express. \n \nA reminder can recall forgotten memories. Hence the menus on a computer screen. \nRecognition of a command is easier than remembering the exact wording of a \ncomputer instruction. A valuable feature of an information system may therefore be to \n\u201cjog the memory\u201d, to present cues and analogies that can stimulate ideas in the pool of \ntacit knowledge. A second valuable feature can be the ability to access the tacit \nknowledge of others through discussion and inquiry. A third feature of the system \ncould be the use of images and video demonstrations to illustrate, for example, the \nprocedures used in collecting samples, or the precise points examined on an outcrop. \nThese could clarify a narrative account, and would help others to repeat and test the \nobservations. \n \n1.6 Knowledge-based and rules-based investigation \n \nExamples presented to students (I 3) are not typical of the procedures of experienced \ngeologists surveying an unknown area. During an initial survey, a comprehensive set \nof observations is likely to be made and recorded, if only to avoid the cost of \nrevisiting each outcrop. For a graduate research project, a local, self-contained \nproblem might be sought, preferably with significance in a wider context. The \nabundance of such problems in geoscience makes it an attractive subject to study. On \nthe other hand, the search for oil is more likely to employ techniques that are well \nestablished on a global scale, in tune with the uniform business objectives. The fact \nthat the model is well defined before the investigation begins (being based on a clear \nuser requirement) increases the scope for rules-based activity and so for automation.  \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part J  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \n \nThis points to a distinction between exploratory investigation and systematic pre-\nplanned investigation. The first is knowledge-based, starting from some \npreconception of the geological setting and developing and extending the explanation \nwith each new observation. Evidence is constantly sought, by new observations or \nreworking data, to confirm or modify the current interpretation and choose the next \nstep of the investigation in the context of growing background knowledge. A narrative \naccount is built in episodic memory. The second is rules-based, where the pattern of \nthe investigation is decided before work starts. In contrast to the exploratory search of \nthe knowledge-based project, the rules-based project is analytical, studying known \nrelationships by collecting and studying appropriate data, following a well-defined \nmodel. Standard procedures are specified, and instructions set out for following them. \nThe resulting data are therefore consistent, and can be compared with one another and \nwith data from other projects that followed similar rules. Short-term memories are \nrecorded, and can be accurately recreated from the database. \n \nRules-based projects can be well suited to quantitative measurement and extensive \ninstrumentation. The seismic investigations of the North Sea, and downhole logs from \nthe subsequent drilling, provide examples of data collected by instruments according \nto pre-defined rules. Their consistency makes them particularly helpful in revealing \nregional pattern. A rigid, pre-determined structure can also extend the reach of the \ndesigners of an investigation by delegating data collection to instruments or \nmethodical human data gatherers. The plan is inflexible and cannot readily be \nadjusted in the light of the initial findings. \n \nKnowledge-based projects have fewer precedents to guide the activity. They explore \nthe unknown, and procedures must be modified as more is learned.  The students who \narrive at the outcrop not knowing what they are going to see are in this position. In \nfact, projects are likely to involve both rules-based and knowledge-based procedures. \nFor example, a seismic survey may collect data according to a predetermined scheme, \nbut the interpretation of those data is knowledge-based, evolving as ideas are tested \nand knowledge of the geology of the area grows. The student, carrying out an \nexploratory investigation, may nevertheless follow predetermined conventions when \nmeasuring strike and dip, and might even randomize the sampling procedure to aid \nsubsequent analysis. Every rules-based activity is ultimately set in the knowledge-\nbased framework of the science as a whole. \n \nThe distinction between knowledge-based and rules-based activities is important in \nthe present context, because (work on artificial intelligence notwithstanding) \nknowledge remains largely the preserve of the human being.  The machine, on the \nother hand, can be adept at following rules. Bear in mind, however, that automation \ncan support free thinking and trial and error. An IT response to knowledge-based \nactivities is to use flexible multimedia, creating fully connected and searchable \ndocuments.  An IT response to rules-based activities, on the other hand, is a \nrigorously defined model and database supporting standardized applications. It makes \nfull use of instruments for data collection and analysis.   \n \nThe computer is well suited to accurate long-term storage of complex images and \ndetailed tabular data, such as lists of fossils or results of geochemical analyses; but the \nbrain (where accurate detail is restricted to short-term memory) is not. The brain is \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part J  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nwell adapted to handling, within a frame of existing background knowledge, the loose \nstructure of descriptions, analogies and explanatory reasoning typical of a narrative \naccount; but the computer is not. \n \nIT should aim to harmonize knowledge-based human skills with rules-based computer \nmodeling. As the approaches overlap and combine, the information system should \noptimize the abilities of both. An important part of the solution is interactive \ncomputing - a conversation between the user and the machine, in which the screen \ndisplay is modified rapidly in response to instructions or decisions entered usually by \nkeyboard or mouse. The ability of the computer to follow rules quickly and accurately \nis complemented by the ability of the scientist to use background knowledge to \ncontrol the progress of the activity. \n \n1.7 Modes of thought \n \nThe various information types (text, spatial, structured, tacit) are handled differently \nby the brain. Each supports a different style of thought, communication and IT \nsystem. We use them, separately or together, to model knowledge and information in \nvarious modes of thought and investigation, such as the following: \n \n Narrative - one can pass on information, or develop a point of view, by telling \na story. As Francis Bacon pointed out in 1652 (see Leatherdale, 1974), one can revisit \nthe reasons for reaching a conclusion by going over in one's mind the events that led \nto it. Each part of the narrative depends on the story so far. By telling the tale to \nothers, they too may follow the line of reasoning. \n \n Temporal - geological explanations trace the course of past events, relating \nobservations to a conceptual time sequence of past conditions (states) and processes. \n \n Spatial - geoscience maps and images provide the means to locate \nobservations and link them to spatial pattern and spatial relationships. To understand \nthe pattern of ice flow, or sequence and extent of lava flows, the students (I 3) were \nled naturally to a map. The meaning of the observations depends on their spatial \ncontext. \n \n Demonstration - narrative description is more powerful if augmented by \nactually demonstrating what happened, in the field or laboratory (the ostensive \napproach). For a full picture, it may be desirable to retrace the work, and so share the \nexperience, of an earlier investigator. \n \n Quantitative - the benefits of precise measurement have wide application and \nare immediately obvious in, for example, hydrocarbons exploration, where detailed \nprediction of the form and properties of the strata is required, leading to estimates of \nthe location and magnitude of the oil and gas reserves. \n \n Statistical - statistical theory provides a rigorous basis for marshaling \ncomplex evidence for testing hypotheses, and estimating probabilities and uncertainty, \nby computation from appropriately sampled observations and measurements. \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part J  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \n Process-response - the concept that physical, chemical and biological \nprocesses operated in the past as they do now, is the basis for much geoscientific \nthinking. A coherent picture of past processes should be internally consistent and \nshould predict responses (consequences) comparable to those of present-day systems. \n \n Experimental - some processes and responses can be explored by experiment, \nthat is, under circumstances that the scientist can control, leading to a more exact \nunderstanding of the relationships.  \n \n Trial and error - where the course that an investigation will take is not clear, \na heuristic approach may be adopted, trying out a range of possibilities, following \nthose which seem most successful, and modifying them as more is learned. \n \nThe information type and mode of thought play a large part in determining whether IT \nmethods are relevant and which methods are appropriate. Conversely, technology \ninfluences the ways we think and the combinations of modes of investigation. \n \n1.8 The need for a Geoscience Markup Language \n \nThis chapter is concerned with where we want to go, not how we get there. However, \nthe requirement may be clearer if we have a mechanism in mind. Conventional \nmethods of recording information have deficiencies. The poor connectivity enforced \nby earlier technology results in high redundancy and inflexibility. Processes to \nmanage, manipulate and explain information are frozen along with their \nrepresentation. Change is cumbersome, because minor corrections in the literature are \neasily overlooked, and when ideas change, the full knock-on effects on other work are \nseldom obvious. \n \nWe are looking for a mechanism that can offer better facilities for new investigations, \nwhile incorporating legacy material. A markup language could be one approach to \nimproving communication. It can represent conventional narrative text, but can also \ninclude tags. Unlike HTML, where the tags control presentation and links, XML (E 6) \ncan also tag words or sections by topic (this is a fossil name, this is the section on \nstructural geology). Presentation is handled separately through a style sheet and can \nbe controlled by the reader.  \n \nAs its name indicates, XML is extensible. The ability of users to define their own tags \ncould result in a large and unwieldy language. Therefore, specific dialects of XML \nhave grown up and been partly standardized within subject areas. Thus Chemical \nMarkup Language (CML) can tag chemical formulae, and display them, or models of \nthe molecular structure, with a choice of conventions and notations. Other dialects \nhave been developed for fields such as mathematics and music, to handle their \nspecialist notations and offer flexibility in presentation. \n \nA Geoscience Markup Language (GML) could also be a specialist subset of XML, \nand thus have the ability to tag words or sections (modules) of the text to reflect their \ntopic. Such modules could be linked to others, within the document or elsewhere. We \nthink of the conventional literature as subdivided into encyclopedias, books, serials, \nreports, notes, maps, and so on. The subdivisions are based on physical form and \nprocess of delivery. Instead, we could visualize a GML document as a collection of \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part J  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nmodules brought together for a particular purpose, with many of them reusable in \nother contexts. Authorship takes on a different meaning where modules are assembled \nfrom many sources, possibly offering alternative explanations of the same \nphenomena. \n \nA markup language, however, also offers the possibility of linking text closely and \nselectively to modules from, say, metadata, data, software, models, demonstrations on \nvideo or sources of expert advice. Many of these would be accessed through a \ndatabase management system or a GIS (E 5), although this need not be apparent to the \ncasual user. A module could be displayed in different ways to meet individual needs \n(a table of data or a graph, a contour map or a perspective view). It would be an \nintegral part of the document. But it would also offer the possibility of moving to and \nfrom a different environment, such as a GIS to explore the spatial context, or a \ndatabase for comparison with analogous datasets from other investigations. Another \nuser option could be to select the level of generalization, while retaining the ability to \ndrill down to additional detail when required. Change to one module would be seen \nby all modules connected to it, and knock-on effects could be traced through the links. \n \nThe technology is largely in place, and starting to operate in some other subjects. \nSuch languages immediately offer greater flexibility and expressive power to the \nauthor. Geoscientists have special needs for interworking with spatial, historic and \nstratigraphic information, and have their own vocabulary and procedures. They could \ntherefore justify a separate dialect of XML. But there is a long and painful learning \ncurve, and geoscientists will be involved in much trial and much error before a robust \nsolution for everyday use can emerge. \n \nWith an appropriate markup language, linkage to the underlying context of \nassumptions, laws and hypotheses could be recorded and therefore the effects of \nchanges in the underlying ideas could be clarified. To take this further, however, we \nneed to consider the process of building knowledge from information, and the object-\noriented approach that stems from this. \n \n2. Processes and the repository \n \n2.1 Explanation \n \nHaving looked at communication (J 1), the next question is how scientists explain \ntheir observations and make sense of streams of observational data. How do we build \nknowledge from information? The Encyclopedia Britannica (1973) is again helpful \nwith its entry on Scientific Method, where it defines the pursuit of science as \u201cthe \nsearch for knowledge and understanding through formulation of the laws of nature.\u201d \nThe theoretical function of science is that of providing explanations of natural \nphenomena by discovering relationships between these phenomena and other events. \nThese relationships fall under general laws that enable us to make predictions as to \nwhat events to expect in particular circumstances, and sometimes, by controlling the \ncircumstances, to ensure that these events will occur. The practical function of \nscience, that of enabling us to adjust our lives to nature and, sometimes, nature to our \nlives, thus derives from its intellectual function - that of explaining phenomena by \nmeans of scientific laws. \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part J  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nA starting point for scientific explanation is classification (systematically assigning \nobjects to categories based on their properties). Recognizing an object as a sediment \nor an intrusion has implications about its geological behavior. The words used to \nname objects are nouns. Adjectives, like red, angular or hard, describe their attributes \nbut are less useful for classification, saying little about how the objects behave. The \nstudents' visit to Salisbury Crags (I 3) began by distinguishing, identifying and \nnaming the sedimentary and intrusive rocks, relating them to their behavior in the \ngeological past. The extension of this activity to formal data analysis is described in  \nH 3. \n \nScientific discovery involves finding hypotheses (suppositions made as a starting \npoint for further investigation) that could be refuted by further experience (see \nPopper, 1996), but which nevertheless survive testing by observation or if possible by \nexperiment (observations made in circumstances over which the scientist has \ncontrol). A hypothesis in I 3 was that the rocks of the cliff face are part of an intrusive \nsill. This was tested by thinking about what additional observational evidence might \nbe found and then looking for it. Although the original events are beyond the reach of \nexperiment, a detailed model of aspects of the processes, say, the baking of the \nsandstone, might be tested experimentally given appropriate facilities to replicate the \nhigh pressures and temperatures involved. The purpose may be to find more laws \nabout the behavior of the things we can observe or to incorporate the results in a \nbroader explanatory theory. \n \nScientific laws enable us to organize our thinking into coherent systems as well as to \nmake predictions. The laws are at many different levels of generality, arranged in a \nhierarchical system in which laws at a low level are logical consequences of sets of \nlaws at a higher level, and so on. The lowest-level laws are general propositions \nwhose instances are directly observable facts, but higher-level laws may be theoretical \nconcepts in a wider system explaining new phenomena. Explanations in geoscience \nmay present the observed situation as a logical consequence of preceding events and \nof more fundamental regularities, such as the laws of physics, operating on initial \nconditions of a geographical or historical kind. If we view the process of successive \nexplanation as the erection of a hierarchy of laws of increasing generality, there is no \nreason to prevent different hierarchies from being constructed in different ways to \nexplain the same phenomena (Kent, 1978). \n \n2.2 Analogy \n \n\u201cTo explain the origin of hypotheses I have a hypothesis to present. It is that \nhypotheses are always suggested through analogy. Consequential relations of nature \nare infinite in variety and he who is acquainted with the largest number has the \nbroadest basis for the analogic suggestion of hypotheses\u201d (Gilbert, 1896, quoted by \nLeatherdale, 1974). \n \nAnalogy is the resemblance in some particulars between things otherwise unlike. \nAnalogy can be a resemblance in an ensemble of qualities, or of properties or \nattributes. In metaphor, the mind sees and expresses an analogy. The metaphorical use \nof language in science arises when familiar vocabulary is extended to describe novel \ninsights and interpretations. Thus in coining the term electric current, ideas were \ncarried across from the familiar current in a river. Metaphor, according to the Oxford \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part J  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nEnglish Dictionary, is \u201cthe figure of speech in which a name or descriptive term is \ntransferred to some object different from, but analogous to, that to which it is properly \napplicable.\u201d Analogy in logic, according to the same source, is the process of \nreasoning from parallel cases, based on the assumption that if things have some \nsimilar attributes, other attributes will be similar. Most of the truly fruitful facts about \nnature, Leatherdale (1974) suggests, have been discovered by reasoning from \nanalogy. \n \nAccording to Leatherdale, explanation involves an inescapable use of analogy. This is \npartly because the unobserved part of the description in an explanation, being \nunobserved, cannot be directly described. It must be verbalized and conceptualized in \nterms of other experiences. Explanation works by analogy of content as well as of \nstructure. When the analogy is well marked in terms of content, or observable \ncharacteristics, we speak of a model. The model is an essential tool, in that it enables \nus to think about the unfamiliar in terms of the familiar.  \n \nModels enable us to construct and meaningfully describe the concepts of theories in \nthe same way as metaphors enable us to think about or describe things or concepts not \nnormally describable in a literal vocabulary. Because they function in this way, they \ngive meaning to, and thus an explanation of, theories. This in turn enables them to \nconnect theory with observation and experiment. Thus, in the belief that past \nprocesses obeyed the same physical and chemical laws as today, analogies are drawn \nin geology with present-day processes, as in comparing an unconformity to a present-\nday erosion surface, in seeing finer crystals as indicating more rapid cooling, or in \nexplaining changes in sandstone petrography as baking against an igneous intrusion. \n \n \n2.3 Model and reality \n \nGeoscience investigations are usually concerned, not with creating a new model, but \nwith refining an existing one. They build on earlier work and must be closely linked \nto past records. The model is concerned not only with what is there, but also how it \ncame about - how the operation of physical, chemical and biological processes, in a \nsequence of events in geological time, brought about the observed consequences. The \nmodel influences the classification of objects. For instance, the geologist sees an \nimportant distinction between a granite and an overlying pebble conglomerate, despite \ntheir similar composition and appearance, because they formed in quite different \ncircumstances. \n \nAs pointed out earlier (B 4), the neat and tidy classification of rocks shown on a \ngeological map or reported in the literature is unrealistic. The overlap, ambiguity and \nuncertainty so painfully apparent in the field have been banished. Crisply bounded \nareas of uniformity have somehow replaced the fuzzy boundaries and mish-mash of \nintercalated variation. Goodchild (1992) suggested that: \u201cWe need better methods for \ndealing with the world as a set of overlapping continua, instead of forcing the world \ninto the mould of rigidly bounded objects.\u201d Quantitative techniques (F) are a possible \ncandidate for representing the geological \u201ccontinuum\u201d, although Mandelbrot pointed \nout that continuity is conspicuous by its absence in natural phenomena (G 6). We now \nneed to consider whether the categories are necessary, or an artifact imposed by \ninadequate technology. \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part J  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \n \nThe distinction between model and reality is an important one. The model must be \ntuned to human thought while reflecting something useful about the real world. A \ncontinuous model, such as a contour map, may be an appropriate representation of \ndiscontinuous reality, as long as the discrepancy is not important in the context in \nwhich the model is being used. The danger comes when the limitations are forgotten \nand questions that cannot be properly answered by the model, such as the length of a \ncoastline (G 6), are addressed within it. Separate models relying on different \nassumptions are required for different purposes. For example, a statistical model \nmight regard a process as deterministic and predictable, together with a superimposed \nrandom element for which only the statistical properties (as opposed to individual \ninstances) could be predicted. On the other hand, a dynamic nonlinear model might \nregard the process as deterministic (in the sense of following natural laws) but \nunpredictable because small variations in the initial conditions could lead to a large \nchange in the outcome (Baker and Gollub, 1996). \n \nThere is another issue. The model must be one that the available data and technology \ncan support. New IT solutions extend the range of models that are realistically \navailable. Looking at the computer display illustrated in Fig. 1, for example, there is a \nclear possibility of modeling three-dimensional rock bodies in new ways. The image \ncan show discontinuous areas. Zooming in to part of the image could cause the areas \nto fragment and reveal more detail, as discontinuous as before. The scope of the \nmodel in Fig. 1 is limited. It is a stunning image when seen in full motion on the \nscreen, and no doubt serves its purpose well. But it is tied to just one set of properties, \nrelated to acoustic impedance within a body of rock.  \n \n \n \nFig. 1. Display of 3d seismic data.

Satellite imagery records a number of related properties, \nnamely separate bands of the electromagnetic spectrum measured simultaneously. The \nproperties can be analyzed quantitatively and, for example, classes based on \ndiscriminant analysis (F 5) can be displayed (Fig. 2). They again serve their purpose \nwell, and are a useful reminder of the variation hidden in conventional cartography. \nBut they complement and extend earlier methods, rather than displacing them. One \nreason is that three-dimensional seismic surveys and satellite imagery are unusual in \ntheir dense and regular sampling patterns that make detailed analysis possible. \nRelating them to other variables sampled on other patterns by other means calls for \nbackground knowledge and human interpretation. Limitations of access and \nmeasuring procedures mean that the data for most variables are inevitably inaccurate \nand incomplete. \n \n \n \nFig. 2. Classification of land use from a satellite image. Example of satellite imagery classified by an \niterative technique.

More on \nhttp:\/\/www.rockware.com\/catalog\/pages\/dimple.html \n \nOur aims cannot be solely descriptive, for geoscience is concerned with recreating a \nstory from incomplete evidence. It is a story about objects, identified by nouns, given \nmeaning by the models in which they participate, and their properties, described by \nadjectives of qualitative assessment or quantitative measurement. The creation of the \nmain object classes, such as stratigraphic units, and the assignment of instances to \nthese classes, seldom depend on subtle quantitative comparisons. They depend on \ndrawing analogies and spotting crucial features. They depend on building up a pattern \nof behavior of objects within models and relating them to a place in the overall \nscheme of things (the current paradigm), more likely tied to fuzzy concepts than to \nmeasurable properties. \n \nEven where an example or instance of an object class is described, such as the \nlithology of a core or well sample, a descriptive term (say, biohermal dolomite) may \nplace it in a category that reflects an impression of many characteristics. We thus \nbenefit from the ability of the human brain to recognize complex patterns specific to \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part J  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nthe context. This lends itself to narrative description, not to point-by-point \nquantitative comparison. From an initial broad appreciation of the situation, we \nobserve and describe to extend our model. It is not difficult to think of examples \nwhere several conceptual process models are invoked. In the example at I 3, they dealt \nwith sedimentary deposition, igneous activity, regional tilting and glacial erosion. The \nprocesses they refer to are worldwide. But we were looking at their consequences \nwithin a small area. Without conscious deliberation, we selected objects (the rock \nbodies) that took part, with the same definition, in each of the models. We naturally \nplaced the objects and the processes at appropriate positions within the same \nframework of space and geological time. In M 2.3, we look at spatial and stratigraphic \nmodels which make that framework explicit for computer processing. Meantime, we \nnote that objects seem to be chosen by a subtle process that depends on the intuition \nand background knowledge of the human mind. \n \nAt a general level, object classification and identification (H 5) are well suited to our \nthought processes, and may be assisted but not greatly changed by new technology. \nQuantitative methods, on the other hand, are well suited to computer processing. They \nare appropriate where there is a clear physical model that can be represented \nmathematically, as in seismic processing, gravity corrections, and so on. Their crucial \ncontribution may lie, not in interpreting the geology, but in clarifying the geological \nsignificance of the records by removing extraneous effects (F). Where wider \nconclusions follow quantitative analysis of the raw data, as for example in seismic \nstratigraphy, they may result from non-quantitative reasoning. The new insights \nnevertheless depended on technology extending the reach of human thought. \n \nSubtle variations in properties or composition (M 2.3) may be detected by quantitative \nanalysis (F 5), as, for example, the identification of distinct lava flows from \npetrographic studies in the example of I 3. Statistical reasoning, based on randomly \nsampled measurements, can be a surprisingly powerful approach, even when based on \nthe apparently weak concept of testing whether observed patterns were likely to have \narisen by chance. \n \nIT offers the opportunity to build models that span the modes of human thought (J \n1.7), combining their individual strengths. Quantitative reasoning, such as a computer \nprocess that simulates states and events, can be embedded in a narrative that explains \nits significance, limitations and context. Quantitative reasoning can be linked to \ncartographic and spatial thinking by computer visualization. Individual measurements \ngain meaning from the context of spatial pattern. Human insight, intuition and modes \nof thought remain supreme, but can be expressed in new ways. The wide range of \nmodels which IT supports can lead to better understanding, provided their properties \nand the limitations of their analogies are clearly appreciated. \n \n2.4 The object-oriented approach \n \nOur thought processes, constrained by technology, ultimately determine how we \nrecord and handle data. The object-oriented approach attempts to match those \nprocesses with IT procedures. According to Coad and Yourdon (1991), three methods \nof organization pervade our thinking about the real world: \n\u2022 differentiation of experience into particular objects and their attributes \n\u2022 distinction between whole objects and their component parts \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part J  (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \n\u2022 distinction between different classes of objects. \n \nIt is not difficult to think of examples from geoscience in terms of rock types, fossils, \nstratigraphic units, geological processes and so on. For instance, here is an outcrop \n(object), somewhat overgrown and deeply weathered (attributes), beside the river and \nunder the bridge (spatial relationships). The outcrop (whole object) consists of beds of \nsandstone (component parts), containing grains of quartz and mica (components). It is \ninterbedded (spatial relationship) with shales (different object class), and contains \n(spatial relationship) fossils (different object class).  \n \nReality is a seamless web of infinite complexity, but the human mind can cope with \nonly a limited amount of information at one time. Abstraction reduces the complexity \nby separating out a model dealing with a small number of things that are important to \nthe purpose in hand. All words, language and data are abstractions and incomplete \ndescriptions of the real world. There is thus no correct model of a situation, only \nadequate or inadequate ones. An object model describes the structure of objects in a \nsystem, their identity, relationships with other objects, attributes and operations. \nCommon relationships are being (as in sandstone is a sedimentary rock), having (as in \nthis sandstone has graded bedding) and doing. A dynamic model describes those \naspects of a system concerned with time and the sequencing of operations - events \nthat mark changes, states and organization, whereas a functional model captures \nwhat a system does, without regard for how or when it is done. \n \nLanguage, images, quantitative modeling and demonstration all share the tendency to \nsee the world in terms of objects, attributes and processes, from which may spring the \nnoun, adjective and verb structure of our language (Leatherdale, 1974). Thus, \ncommunication in geoscience, by whatever means, concerns processes (which cause \nthings to change) and objects (the things of interest), the object classes, and their \nattributes (properties, composition, relationships and behavior). An object should not \nbe constrained by information type. One object, such as a borehole description, might \ncomprise a text description and a geographic reference. It thus includes both text and \nspatial information types, which might be stored separately and accessed by different \nsoftware. Many of the objects invoked in a narrative have second homes in other, \npossibly more structured environments. For example, a paper describing a fossil \nlocality might include a list of species that could also appear in a paleontological \nregister, and could be plotted on a map of fossil distribution, and linked to a \nstratigraphic table. The user must therefore interface with distributed objects, related \nto various topics, and represented by a mixture of information types. \n \nObject classes, by definition, belong in a hierarchical sequence (H 5), inheriting \nattributes from classes farther up the hierarchy. Thus sandstone may inherit properties \nfrom its superclass sedimentary rocks. A data model (I 2.2) can assemble object \nclasses into topics such as (examples in brackets): stratigraphic (formation), \nbibliographic (document), petrographic (thin section), paleontological (specimen of \nfossil). The topics are not mutually exclusive, so that a fossil description could be \nboth a paleontological object and a bibliographic object. Within each topic, rules and \nstandards can ensure that information is consistent and comparable. The fossil, as a \npaleontological object, is named according to the rules of fossil nomenclature, \ndescribed according to paleontological conventions. The fossil description, as a \nbibliographic object, is cataloged according to international rules. A single object may \nLoudon, T.V., 2000.
