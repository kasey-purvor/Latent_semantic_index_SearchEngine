The appreciation of these trends is placed in the wider his-\ntorical context signified by the advent of modernity and the diffusion of the bureaucratic form of or-\nganizations. The article attempts to dissociate bureaucracy from the dominant connotations of central-\nized and rigid organizational arrangements. It identifies the distinctive mark of the modern workplace \nwith the crucial fact that it admits human involvement in non-inclusive terms. Modern humans are \ninvolved in organizations qua roles rather than qua persons. Innocent as it may seem, the separation \nof the role from the person has been instrumental to the construction of modern forms of human \nagency. An organizational anthropology is thereafter outlined based on Gellner\u2019s (1996) conception of \n\u201cModular Man\u201d. Modernity and bureaucracy construe human beings as assemblages of relatively in-\ndependent behavioural modules that can be invoked individually or in combination to respond to the \ndifferentiated character of the contemporary world. While the occupational mobility and organiza-\ntional flexibility currently underway presuppose a model of human agency that recounts basic attrib-\nutes of the modular human, they at the same time challenge it in some important respects. \n \nDescriptors: bureaucracy, contingency, employment and organization forms, human agency, selectiv-\nity, work.  \n \n \nIntroduction\u2217\n \nThe shifts in employment forms that have been taking place during the last two decades or so \nbear increasing evidence that the very terms by which contemporary people are involved in \nformal organizations are irrevocably changing. Labour contracts other than traditional, the \nflexibilization of work time and the dissociation of work from particular sites stand as the \nepitomes of these changing premises by which increasing numbers of people are currently \ntied to organizations (Beck 1992; Carnoy 2000; Rifkin 1995; Sennett 2000). Destandardiza-\ntion of labour, as Beck (1992) summarizes this tripartite development, impinges upon society \n 2\nas a whole. But it is unmistakably associated with major shifts in work habits and the institu-\ntional or organizational forms that have, during several decades, sustained lifetime employ-\nment and clear-cut job assignments. On the one hand, current changes in employment forms \ndo challenge some of the older premises (e.g. stability, continuity, career and loyalty) on \nwhich the making of occupational and professional identity was based. On the other hand, \nthey destabilize the institutional forms (i.e. rights, commitments or obligations) and processes \n(i.e. collective negotiations) that have shaped or regulated the terms by which individuals \nhave traditionally been tied to organizations (Beck 1992; Rifkin 1995).  \nThe developments in work and employment currently underway are commonly associated \nwith the overall shifts in the modes of economic involvement that coincide with the emer-\ngence of the information economy in this late industrial age (Bell 1976; Castells 1996, 2000; \nRifkin 2000). They are also related, albeit less often, with the overall cultural reorientation of \ncontemporary societies, manifested, among other things, in the growing individualism and the \nwidespread distrust to social institutions (Bauman 1992; Beck and Beck-Gernsheim 1996, \n2002; Sennett 1992). Taken together, the current trends in employment forms suggest a con-\nception of work that is predicated upon an understanding of human agency that puts a pre-\nmium on the qualities of malleability, flexibility and adaptability. The terms by which people \nare currently involved in organizations seem to differ in some substantial respects from the \nstable forms of human involvement in organizations that have been dominant during the last \nhundred years or so (Beck 1992, 2000).  \nThe present article sets out to address some of the issues associated with the mentioned de-\nvelopments. It is more precisely concerned with the changing premises of human involvement \nin organizations underlying the employment and organization trends described above and the \nvery assumptions about human agency on which they are predicated. The very momentum of \ncurrent developments suggests, however, that the emerging employment forms and the organ-\nizational changes with which they are associated need to be placed in their wider historical \ncontext and evaluated accordingly. The consideration of the models of human agency, under-\nlying the constitution of the workplace during the last hundred years or so, seems to be essen-\ntial to the project of understanding the key behavioural premises of the current economic and \nlabour developments. The rather broad orientation of the present work should make clear that \nits focus is on delineating a few basic ideas that capture the core terms by which contempo-\nrary humans are implicated in organizations. Despite its focus on forms of human agency the \narticle is not concerned with the subjective work experiences of particular persons or groups \nbut with the anatomy of the very terms governing human involvement in organizations. In \n 3\nother words, the focus is on the forms of human participation, which current processes of \nformal organizing admit, not on subjective experiences. Furthermore, the article aims at con-\ntributing to an understanding of contemporary modes of work and human involvement in or-\nganized systems. It is not concerned with advancing evaluative statements as to what is good \nor bad, though some judgements of this sort are by necessity involved in the course of devel-\noping the major claims of the present work. \nThe article is structured as follows. First, the current developments in work, organization and \nemployment forms are briefly reviewed and the changing terms by which individuals are tied \nto organization are identified. Next, the network-form of organization, commonly associated \nwith the changing terms by which people are tied to organizations, is examined and the \nclaims concerning the drift away from the bureaucratic organization are subjected to scrutiny. \nThe article dissociates bureaucracy from the dominant connotations of centralized and rigid \norganizational arrangements. It connects the emergence of the bureaucratic form of organiza-\ntion with the establishment of modernity and the mobility across classes, occupations and in-\nstitutional boundaries, which modernity introduced. Mobility is however only a precondition \nfor the emergence of the modern workplace. Drawing on a number of prominent scholars (e.g. \nGellner 1983, 1996; Luhmann 1982; 1995), bureaucracy is identified with the non-inclusive \nterms by which individuals are tied to organizations. The distinctive mark of the modern \nworkplace is the fact that humans are involved in it qua roles not qua persons. Bureaucracy \nregulates work but leaves other aspects of a person\u2019s life, i.e. family, community or public \nlife, outside of its immediate jurisdictions. Modern human agency is constituted as modular \n(Gellner 1996), i.e. modern humans are capable of mobilizing in a piecemeal fashion various \nsegments of themselves, in response to the demands raised by the distinct institutional realms \nof modern life. The last section brings together the various claims of the article in an attempt \nto make sense of the current developments in work, organization and employment forms. It \ntraces much of the contemporary mobility to the models of human agency introduced and es-\ntablished by bureaucracy but identifies important differences between the organizational or-\nder of first (early) and second (late) modernity. The modular constitution of human agency \ndoes not any longer accommodate the different demands of the institutional realms of work, \nfamily, community and public life. It looses its anchoring into these institutions of modern \npolity and tends to end up as a sheer functional device that serves the purpose of adaptability \nin a perpetually changing world.  \n \n \n 4\nInterpreting Current Employment Trends \n \nThe emerging employment forms that we previously summarized, following Beck (1992), \nunder the label of destandardization of labour comprise several distinct developments. Tradi-\ntional forms of work in the industrial age have been usually identified with particular sites \nand fixed time schedules. They have often been thought to involve lifetime employment or, in \nany case, enduring affiliation with the institution in which work is performed. Therefore, du-\nration and location could be used as basic dimensions to differentiate between the various \nwork patterns currently underway, and the employment forms that seek to accommodate \nthem. A few observations should be made in this context. Traditional labour contracts have \nbeen closely associated with what historians of technology call the factory system, i.e. the \nspatio-temporal concentration of the production of goods and services, the discipline and con-\ntrol of work. However, the relationship between the conditions of work and the forms of em-\nployment is historically contingent. Different conditions of work could be accommodated \nwithin the same labour contract and perhaps vice versa. The employment contract is after all \na social relationship whereas work is heavily conditioned by social but also technological and \nmaterial conditions (Arendt 1958; Zuboff 1988). While being aware of the differences in-\nvolved, for reasons of convenience we would not draw a sharp line between the two in the \ncontext of this article. \nA typical employment trend that is often thought to contrast sharply with traditional lifetime \nemployment is represented by the increasing diffusion of time-limited contracts. Time-\nlimited forms of employment are not entirely new but they have become increasingly legiti-\nmate in recent years. Most significantly, they have increasingly diffused beyond contingent \nwork or specific industries (e.g. art or performance industry) to involve highly skilled profes-\nsionals across various domains (Carnoy 2000; Tilly and Tilly 1998). Telework or deterritoril-\nized forms of work represent another relatively recent trend in work and employment. Deterri-\ntorialized or virtual work does break with the time patterns (thirty-five to forty-hour per week \nand fixed schedule) of standard labour contracts. But above all, it violates the sense of par-\nticular location and proximity to fellow workers or peers that have always been accompanied \nthe meaning of work in modern times (Blocklehurst 2001; Sotto 1997).  \nWhile analytically distinct, limited-duration and location-independent forms of work re-\nenhance one another and can be combined into particular employment contracts. A distinctive \ntechnical quality of labour contracts of this sort is the grouping of tasks into modules that can \nbe detached from particular contexts and be assigned to people with small or no acquaintance \n 5\nwith specific organizations. They thus contribute to mobility and exchangeability of labour. \nIn this respect, the term destandardization of labour may be quite misleading. While duration \nand location are destandardized in the sense of being subject to variation (varying times, no \ninstitutional work site), the content of work itself may be rendered increasingly standardized \nto become independent from those who are to be called upon to perform it. Standardization is \nessential to exchangeability. Indeed, a requirement of many time-limited jobs seems to be the \nstandardization of the work content that renders the execution of work independent of the \nskills and abilities of particular people. While temporary work in technologically advanced \nprojects may not conform to this claim, other so-called contingent work (Matusik and Hill \n1988; Tilly and Tilly 1998) may be subject to severe standardization, consequent upon its low \nskill variety. \nLimited-duration and location-independent forms of work have combined with other social or \ncultural factors to reduce the commitment of employers and employees vis-\u00e0-vis one another \nand vis-\u00e0-vis the state. They have thus contributed to the formation of non-traditional labour \ncontracts that contrast with those that dominated the largest part of the preceding century. It \nis a well known fact by now that the legal edifice of work that regulated labour contracts in \nEurope during the last sixty years or so has been revised in most European countries to ac-\ncommodate flexible forms of employment (Beck 2000). What is often less apparent, how-\never, is that changes in work legislation do not simply promote the flexibilization of employ-\nment forms. They redefine as well the jurisdictions and responsibilities of the institutional \nactors (i.e. labour unions, employer association, state agencies) that have been involved in the \nmaking and regulation of labour markets (Hasselbladh 2000).  \nThe changing jurisdictions and responsibilities of the institutional actors are clearly mani-\nfested on what is often referred to as the individualization of labour (Beck 1992; 2000; Cas-\ntells 1996; Carnoy 2000). By individualization is meant the transference of a growing part of \nthe responsibility for the conditions and content of work away from the institutions of the \nwelfare state and the trade unions to the individual. Obviously, flexibilization and individu-\nalization feed upon one another. This is particularly evident in the case of self-employment \nwhose hesitant re-emergence in North Europe and North America signifies yet another devel-\nopment that leads to the erosion of the employment forms associated with standard labour \ncontracts. Self-employment has always been a highly diffused form of work in Mediterranean \nEurope. In countries like the USA it has, however, been reduced from eighty percent in 1780 \nto ca ten percent in 1980, almost the reverse relation with the development of wage and sala-\nried labour during the same period (Tilly and Tilly 1998). Self-employment represents the \ncomplete negation of commodified labour and the institutional forms it has been associated \nwith. In one sense it has more the character of business venture rather than that of employ-\n 6\nment. To these developments must be added the diffusion of part-time work and the increas-\ning so called feminization of labour markets with which part-time work seems to be \npositively related. \nEmpirical data compiled by Carnoy (2000) using OECD statistics on these emerging forms of \nemployment in the years 1983, 1994 and 1997 or 1998 support some of the claims advanced \nabove, yet they need to be interpreted with care. With the exception of US, part-time and \ntemporary employment have increased in many economically developed nations, though \nthere is spectacular variation in the percentage they represent in employed labour force in \neach nation. In some nations, temporary employment and part-time employment have consid-\nerably diffused while in others, like for instance the US, they have remain rather limited. \nSelf-employment, on the other hand, does not reveal a unified development. It has increased \nin some countries like the UK but remained largely stable in US, Germany and Netherlands \nand diminished in Japan and France. Taken together, however, all these non-standard con-\ntracts represented already in 1994 a significant portion of total employment reaching up to \nfifty percent in some cases (e.g. Spain) and nearly forty percent in some others (e.g. Austra-\nlia, Japan, Netherlands, Italy).  \nMost of these trends are claimed to have diverse origins. On the one hand, they can be attrib-\nuted to the ongoing economic, technological and institutional developments. As briefly men-\ntioned in the introduction, rapid market and institutional change in global scale combines of-\nten with the increasing organizational and business involvement of information and commu-\nnication technologies to bring about conspicuously new employment and organizational \nforms. The emergence of a new internet-based economy further accentuates the demands for \nflexible, boundary-crossing activities in a global scale (Castells 1996, 2000). On the other \nhand, these developments cannot simply be reduced to the needs of industrial-technological-\neconomic complex, no matter how important the interests and priorities of the industry and \neconomy may be. Other, mostly cultural factors have been involved as crucial driving forces \nbehind the mentioned trends. As already indicated, individualism has been a major force in \nmany contemporary people\u2019s favourable orientations towards non-collective, non-\ninstitutional ways of deciding over crucial issues of their lives (Beck 1992; Beck-Gernsheim \n2002; Dumont 1983; Sennett 1992). The emerging employment forms are clearly associated \nwith the growing individualism of contemporary societies, even though individualism itself \nmust be explained in the very end. \nA remarkable paradox, directly associated with the core issues of this article, seems to be un-\nderlying individualism and the emerging work and employment forms. On the one hand, in-\ndividualism represents a major driving force behind the variability and flexibility of current \n 7\nwork and employment practices. On the other hand, the increasing diffusion of these novel \nforms of employment challenge the behavioural and existential unity\/continuity the relatively \nstable employment relations and career paths of bureaucratic organizations have sustained \n(see, e.g., Blocklehurst 2001).  \nThe standard notion and the practice of career development presuppose a coherent behav-\nioural and existential unit, a solid individual capable of constantly assimilating and accumu-\nlating the lessons of a long lasting occupational journey. Most significantly, knowledge thus \nacquired is contextually conditioned and, by extension, contextually sensitive. Yesterday\u2019s \nexperiences are meaningful to present engagements and to future orientations, while they \nbear high contextual relevance (Zuboff 1988). Enlarged spheres of responsibility and higher \npay that are usually associated with career development are by and large justified on this \nground. Lifetime employment precisely represents the institutional form that ties these as-\npects together. Now, all these basic organizational and human premises would seem to be \nthreatened by the cultural, economic and institutional changes mentioned above. Frequent \noccupational change, transient organizational affiliation and cross-contextual mobility would \nseem to challenge the anthropological foundations of the solid and sovereign individual and \nthe instrumental significance of experiential or organization-specific knowledge. As cogently \nremarked by Sennett (2000:43) stability \u2018can demean, but it can also protect. Routine can de-\ncompose labor but it can also compose a life\u2019.  \nIt would be possible to suggest against the background of these observations that the behav-\nioural and existential unity\/continuity associated with the modern occupational identity is be-\ncoming problematic. The concept of career as quasi-linear march forwards must be signifi-\ncantly qualified to accommodate the current trends (Beck 2000; Carnoy 2000; Sennett 2000). \nIndeed, an important outcome of the current developments in employment and organization \nforms is the gradual undermining of the coherent system once formed by occupational iden-\ntity, career development and personal identity. In the emerging post-disciplinary societies of \nfrequent change and boundary crossing, individuals, Deleuze (1995) suggests, are better seen \nas dividuals. Current employment forms are just the expression of these wider economic, in-\nstitutional and cultural developments that put a premium on temporary and shifting forms of \ninvolvement. It is often assumed that these developments are manifested in the drift away \nfrom the basic premises underlying the modern workplace and the bureaucratic form of or-\nganization with which traditional labour contracts have been associated. It is thus necessary \nto turn to the critical examination of these trends. \n \n 8\n \nWork and Organization Forms  \n \nAs already indicated, the developments described above are believed to break with the organ-\nizational patterns inherited from the industrial age. However, despite such a widespread belief, \nthere is scarcely any agreement as to how these developments should be interpreted and less \non the organization forms to which they are getting crystallized. It is commonly assumed that \nthe increasing diffusion of decentralized, network-like forms of organization represents the \nclearest expression of the changing orientations underlying the current age (Castells 1996, \n2000; Fukuyama 1997; Heckscher and Donnellon 1994; Rifkin 2000). However, it is not en-\ntirely clear in which sense the widely acclaimed organizational characteristics of boundary \ncrossing, flexibility and decentralization, underlying the emerging organization forms, may \nconstitute an alternative organizational paradigm that breaks with the work and managerial \nconventions that dominated the western world, during the past century.  \nIf taken together, current changes in forms of employment do break with the inherited work \nconventions. Other developments, however, like those captured by the recent waves of merg-\ners and acquisitions in crucial industries \u2013e.g. banking, insurance or the automobile indus-\ntries- and the construction of huge organizational empires do not precisely conform with the \nclaims of decentralization, flexibility and small scale (Sennett 2000). Operational decentrali-\nzation and the decline of establishment size (Kelly 1998) cannot unproblematically be sepa-\nrated from ownership concentration (Harrison 1994). Most importantly, the emergence of a \nnew organizational paradigm cannot be accounted for by reference to isolated dimensions of \na structural configuration, e.g. degree of centralization (Kallinikos 2001). \nAs it is currently described, the notion of the network-formed organization offers a useful \ncontrast to the standard, hierarchically organized and functionally differentiated organization \nof the industrial age (Castells 1996; Messner 1997; Rifkin 2000). Nevertheless, in its present \nconceptual stage the notion of the network fails to stand as a clear alternative to the dominant \norganization form of the industrial age, i.e. the bureaucratic organization. It offers no more \nthan a suggestive set of images for conceiving current organizational practices but lacks the \nconceptual elaboration of principles of governance and institutionally supported rules of con-\nduct that would justify considering it as an alternative to bureaucracy (Arrow 1974). Let me \nattempt to explain this claim. \nBureaucracy is certainly associated with specific modes of organization but it is above all an \ninstitutional form that embeds core cultural values and social practices. It represents the joint \n 9\noutcome of several axial principles, such as the legal-rational type authority, separation of \noffice duties from personal life, meritocracy and universalism (Weber 1947, 1978). An insti-\ntutional form of that momentum may well accommodate significant variation in modes of \norganization. Indeed, the organizational experience of modernity reveals an amazing diversity \nof structural profiles that could be considered as variations of the bureaucratic form (Chan-\ndler 1977; Pugh et al. 1968; Scott 1981, 1995). Only the radical remaking of the core charac-\nteristics of an institutional form may therefore justify the claim of its decline. Variation of \nsingle characteristics (e.g. degree of centralization) may be of crucial importance indeed but \nsuch variation may lack the momentum necessary to demarcate an age underlain by specific \ninstitutional forms.  \nLittle wonder, interaction and communication across the boundaries of organizations and in-\nstitutions is increasingly taking place these days. Yet, it is far from clear whether networking \npractices of this sort may constitute an alternative model of economic and social organization \nthat challenges the foundations of the bureaucratic order. Networking describes interaction \nand communication patterns of spatio-temporally scattered actors. It is after all, as Castells \n(2000, 2001) himself is prone to recognize, a very old form of communication. The sheer pat-\ntern of message transmission does not therefore suffice to define an alternative organizational \norder. Only the major forms by which people are involved in organizations can deliver the \ncriteria on the basis of which it would be possible to judge the momentum of organizational \nand institutional change. For instance, markets and organizations are commonly considered \nas alternative forms of governance based on the axial principles of free exchange and author-\nity-governed relationships respectively (Arrow 1974; Kallinikos 1996). Furthermore, as we \nwill claim in some detail in the next section, bureaucracy emerged as major institutional form \nthrough the very separation of the role from the person and the authority-based organizational \ngovernance of the former rather than the latter.  \nKey elements of the current developments like the detachment of work processes from par-\nticular settings and the de-institutionalization of the terms by which these processes are nego-\ntiated and made socially available may well constitute the core of such emerging organiza-\ntional paradigm. However, the axial principles of such a paradigm must be thoroughly exam-\nined, conceptually and empirically, and systematically juxtaposed to the behavioural and in-\nstitutional foundations of the bureaucratic form of organization. In the process, the temptation \nto construe bureaucracy in simplified, one-dimensional terms must be avoided. Short of the \ndetailed examination of the institutional premises governing the current practices across or-\nganizational boundaries, the concept of network remains a technically laden metaphor of hu-\n 10\nman communication. It most probably fails to emerge as the organizational core of a new so-\ncial and economic order that breaks with modernity and the principles of the bureaucratic or-\nganization.  \nThese rather crucial issues remain suspended, more than everywhere else, in the managerial-\nist discourse that has enormously popularized the very idea of a new organizational era, \nmarked by flexible, decentralized and \u2018outward\u2019 looking organizations. As pointed out by du \nGay (1994, 2000) and Kallinikos (2001), managerialism sketches these emerging organiza-\ntional patterns in highly stylised, normative and almost ideological terms. Most of the times, \nit delivers without hesitation and question marks, the recipe of corporate success, in an age it \nconstrues as being marked by one and single imperative, i.e. that of market adaptation (e.g. \nHammer and Champy 1991; Womack et al. 1991, Womack and Jones 1996). It should be ob-\nvious that the treatment of the current developments in managerialist terms alone does not \nallow for the appreciation of the deep institutional issues that seem to be associated with them. \nAfter all, the implications of the changing employment and organization forms cannot ade-\nquately be gauged in terms of a narrow managerial rationality of the type captured in re-\nengineering and lean production models.  \nTreating work as simply a resource, managerialism fails to appreciate that it has always been \ntied with core societal issues in modern times. It would be perhaps possible to trace, as it is \noften done, the central position work assumed in modernity back to the entire cosmology that \nWeber once attributed to the protestant ethic (Tawney 1990; Weber 1978). Cultural forms, \ninstitutions and social practices are thereby tied to work. The central place of work in the \ncontemporary world suggests that the employment relations that are currently emerging are \nbound to have far-reaching organizational, individual and social implications. They strike a \nnew balance between forms of living and forms of work and redefine the bond between work, \nwelfare state and democracy that dominated the Western world, during the last century (Beck \n2000). As suggested above, new employment forms mark a decisive turn in the orientations \nof contemporary societies that is most clearly manifested in the redistribution of life respon-\nsibilities away from the state to the individual (Beck 1992, 2000). They thus contribute to the \nemergence of a risky and rather uncertain social territory, traversed by myriad individual ini-\ntiatives that increasingly replace the regulative role once played by the institutions of the wel-\nfare state and other social organizations.  \nJuxtaposed to commonsense views with respect to the organizational patterns and employ-\nment relations entertained by the modern workplace and the bureaucratic form of organiza-\ntion, the developments described above do seem to represent a radical rupture. However, the \n 11\nappreciation of the ongoing occupational and organizational trends and the models of human \nagency they implicate necessitate the careful reconsideration of the modern workplace and \nthe terms by which individuals have been implicated in bureaucracies. Though, stability and \ncontinuity do describe salient features of the occupational and organizational order associated \nwith the bureaucratic form, they fail nonetheless to unravel the distinctive character of the \nbureaucratic organization. The claim itself of the an emerging bureaucratic age, and the or-\nganization forms underlying it, makes necessary the careful appreciation of the distinctive \nmodes by which the bureaucratic form admits human participation. It is therefore of utmost \nsignificance to trace the historical antecedents of the current situation. Seldom are the devel-\nopments, which were only briefly sketched above, tied to the thorough consideration of bu-\nreaucracy as the major organization form of modernity (du Gay 1994; 2000; Kallinikos 2001) \nand the modes of human agency it sustains. \n \n \nSocial and Anthropological Foundations of the Bureaucratic Form \n \nCounter-intuitive as it may seem, the transient and fragmented character of the contemporary \nwork can nevertheless be traced back to the establishment of the bureaucracy, and the mobil-\nity of social relations coinciding with modernity. The emergence of the bureaucratic form of \norganization was predicated on a major anthropological innovation (i.e. a new way of con-\nceiving humanity and institutionally embedding it) that we tend to take for granted these days, \nnamely the clear and institutionally supported separation of work from the rest of people\u2019s \nlife. The conception of work as a distinct sphere of social life, sufficiently demarcated vis-\u00e0-\nvis other social spheres, has had a decisive significance for the constitution of the modern \nworkplace.  \nThe severe separation of work from family, community and public life in general represented \nthe confluence of several social and economic processes (Gellner 1983). However, it would \nbe possible to distinguish out of this complex tangle two crucial social innovations that made \na decisive contribution to the emergence of the modern workplace and the form of organiza-\ntion that came gradually to be designated as bureaucracy. The first of these innovations is as-\nsociated with the well-known decoupling of people\u2019s life chances from status or other heredi-\ntary social relations and the stepwise dissolution of status-based stratification as a basic prin-\nciple of social organization (Gellner 1983; 1996; Luhmann 1995, 1996; Tsivacou 1997). The \ngradual embeddedness of the polity of bourgeois democracy and the dissolution of stratifica-\n 12\ntion brought about the growing social mobility of individuals across classes, territories and \nalso institutions. Obviously, the dissolution of stratification was not an instantaneous act but a \ncomplex, time demanding social process that continued throughout the greatest part of the \ntwentieth century. \nSocial mobility is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for the construction of the \nmodern workplace and the bureaucratic form of organization. A second crucial innovation \nhas therefore been instrumental to these ends. It follows from the first but it is considerably \nmore elusive and, for that reason, easy to overlook. Once mobile people could become divisi-\nble as well. As alluded to earlier, mobility between work, family and community and the \ncriss-crossing of institutional boundaries presuppose different roles and faculties, at the same \ntime as the invocation of roles within one context demands the other roles and faculties to be \ntemporarily suspended. Modern people came increasingly to be characterised by the capacity \nto enact roles in a piecemeal fashion, a condition that was only elementarily present in pre-\nmodern contexts (Gellner 1983; Luhmann 1996; Tsivacou 1997).  \nIn an age in which the core characteristics of the modern workplace are easily discarded as \nold fashioned, it is of utmost importance to appreciate the far-reaching organizational conse-\nquences that are associated with the mobility and the divisible constitution of modern indi-\nviduals. The so much praised quality of adaptability to changing conditions is dependent on \nthe organization\u2019s ability to try out alternative courses of action. This, in turn, implies human \nagents capable of easily moving between varying and shifting roles, i.e. divisible and mobile \nhumans (Luhmann 1982, 1995). It is furthermore crucial to recognize that the terms by which \nthe bureaucratic form tied organizational processes to human agency were bound up with the \ncore characteristics of human mobility and divisibility. The distinctive mark of the bureau-\ncratic legal-rational order is the widely acclaimed dissociation of the requirements of organ-\nizational role taking and performance from the particular mode of being of a person and the \nsocial circumstances surrounding it. The bureaucratic form of organization marks indeed the \nentire predispositions of an age that strives to separate the workplace from home, work from \nfamily, community and public life in general. It represents one of the major institutional vehi-\ncles for expressing these predispositions and embedding the forms of human agency they im-\nplicate (Gellner 1983). \nIt comes therefore as no surprise that the bureaucratic form of organization and the constitu-\ntion of the modern workplace coincide with a set of premises on the basis of which individu-\nals have come to be tied to organizations in terms other than inclusive (Kallinikos 2001). The \nnon-inclusive way of modulating the contributions of people in the modern workplace sug-\n 13\ngests that contemporary humans are not contained (i.e. included) as behavioural and existen-\ntial totalities in organizations (Luhmann 1982, 1989, 1995, 1996). Despite the impressive \ncrowds of people traversing everyday the sites of work, organizations are not made of hu-\nmans qua persons. Bureaucracy introduces an organization form marked by highly selective \naction and communication patterns. Task-structured action\/communication and specialization \nare clear expressions of the high degree of selectivity that govern human behaviour in bu-\nreaucracies.  \nThe bureaucratic selectivity in action and communication is expressed in a complex edifice of \nformal roles (e.g. job description and specification, jurisdictions, accountability) that are sup-\nposed to codify the operational requirements underlying the organizational system. Now, \nroles are enacted by the intrinsically modern capacity of contemporary human beings to sys-\ntematically and consistently suspend all other personal or organizational aspects that do not \nbear upon the role. Such a capacity enables the execution of highly specialized tasks in the \nworkplace and is essential to the exchangeability of organizational roles (i.e. recall the con-\ncept of job rotation). It is also associated with the keen awareness of the largely different de-\nmands underlying the institutional domains of work, family, community and public life in \ngeneral (Kallinikos 2001). \nBureaucracy is thus predicated on an abstract conception of work, namely work as a range of \nactions or duties that can be dissociated from the totality of the lifeworld and from the \ndistinctive mode of being of every person. Being in principle detachable from individuals, \nwork roles become behavioural moulds (admittedly with a variable degree of freedom) that \ncan be designed in advance and without regard for the person (Seyer 1991; Tsivacou 1997). \nThis is, perhaps, one of the major reasons why bureaucracy and the constitution of the \nmodern workplace along the lines suggested here have often been seen as inimical to \nindividuality and personal fulfilment. However, bureaucracy\u2019s relationship to individuality \nand individualism is both complex and ambiguous. A major objective and an important \nconsequence of the innovative character of the bureaucratic modulation of the individual-\norganization relationship is that individuals join the organization not on the basis of general \npsychological or social characteristics (e.g. the logic of status-based or class stratification). \nRather, individuals assume organizational roles on the basis of formal merits and other \nindicators of adequate performance. At the same time, bureaucracy makes individual \nachievement a salient characteristic of the organizational order it builds. Promotion, career \ndevelopment and stable employment itself are depending on individual achievement (Weber \n1947, 1978). \n 14\nThe modulation of the individual-organization relationship in non-inclusive terms is a clear \nexpression of the cultural orientations of modernity and the conception of work as a separate \nsphere of sociality. Bureaucracy thus refrains from determining other aspects of people\u2019s life \nthat remain unrelated to organizational role performance. Little wonder that employment and \nthe significations associated with occupational or professional identity have remained ex-\ntremely important to modern people. They structure their expectations to a considerable de-\ngree and they forcefully impinge upon a large spectrum of their life chances (Beck 1992). \nYet, no matter how important, the personal characteristics that derive from vocational educa-\ntion, professional specialization and working experience they cannot exhaust the amazing di-\nversity of roles, interests and projects underlying modern people. After all, modern society is \nnot a working barrack, though it has sometimes been likened to it (Bauman 1992). An entire \nuniverse of individual interests and undertakings are assumed in the context of institutions \nthat are clearly and unambiguously differentiated from work organizations, e.g. family, \ncommunity, art and public life. \nThese observations suggest that the very separation of the role from the person that epito-\nmizes the bureaucratic form has had far-reaching anthropological implications. The belief \nthat humans can systematically and consistently isolate or repress those aspects of their char-\nacter that do no bear on the execution of organizational roles introduces crucial elements of a \ndistinctive anthropology. The category of the person as a unique identity is rendered redun-\ndant within the context of the organization and the instrumental conditions of work perform-\nance. By the same token, such a way of understanding and instrumenting human agency \nmakes, perhaps for first time in history, enclaves of behavioural pieces (rather than the per-\nson) the basic anthropological input of organizational action\/communication. The bureau-\ncratic organization thus becomes the embodiment of important modern anthropological pre-\ndispositions that are most forcefully revealed by the assumption that the circumstances of \nwork can be severely isolated from the rest of a person\u2019s life. Accordingly, work must be \nexecuted in keeping with a logic, dictated not by the meaningful horizon of the person but by \na significantly narrower ensemble of skills that recounts the operational requirements of ob-\nject manipulation or the demands of a significantly narrower domain of experience. These \nclaims must be further clarified. \n \n \nModular Man \n \n 15\nWhat has been said so far suggests that far from being the natural state of the world, the sepa-\nration of work from the other private or public contingencies of people\u2019s life (not simply the \nhome) is an essential requirement for the establishment of the bureaucratic form of organiza-\ntion. We must not loose sight of this claim that appears to be crucial for understanding and \nappreciating the current shifts in employment and organization forms. The very assumption \nthat work can be separated from the rest of people\u2019s life or the organizational role from the \nperson marks the entire predispositions of an age and signifies a new way of understanding \nand embedding humanity that is instrumental to the construction of the modern workplace. \nAs briefly indicated earlier, such a separation is part of an elaborate set of basic and partly \noverlapping distinctions (e.g. privacy-publicity, work-leisure, workplace-homeplace, male-\nfemale, family-community, education-occupation) that construe human life as a series of \nseparate realms that implicate distinctive expectations and modes of conduct. It is crucial to \nstress the multiple differentiation of work from other aspects of modern life. The distinctive \nstatus of modern work does not simply entail its differentiation, as it is often assumed (see, \ne.g. Blocklehurst 2001; Grint 1991; Sennett 2000), from home and the gender distinctions \nthus imposed. \nThe proclivity of contemporary people to assume different and often divergent roles suggests \nthat the modern human is not precisely understood as being the essence of a unit. Modern \npeople are conceived and fashioned as though they were made of relatively independent \nnumber of behaviour sets that could be invoked individually or in combination to respond to \nthe varying demands, produced by the deeply differentiated and dynamic character of the \ncontemporary world. The constitution of modern humans as loose assemblages of various \nroles precisely allows for the piecemeal mobilization of particular faculties and thus enables \naction along highly selective paths. The everyday transgression of the various demands that \nare underlying the spheres of private, communal, social, and working life represents evidence \nthat contemporary humans are capable of isolating non-context demands and mobilize selec-\ntively particular faculties or roles. But even within the formative context of each social \nsphere, roles vary significantly in ways that accommodate the details of particular situations, \ni.e. mother, housewife, lover in the context of family or employee, union member, depart-\nmental or group member in the context of work. The capability of modern people to shift eas-\nily between various demands and roles cannot but rest on the very decomposability of their \nconstitution. The various bits and pieces, so to speak, they are made of enjoy a relative inde-\npendence from one another. Without this fundamental condition, human faculties would be \npossible to enact only en block (all in one blow) rather than in a piecemeal fashion. \n 16\nThe sort of human being we call modern is therefore better seen as an amalgamation of dis-\ntinct sets of skills and behaviours, a collage, as it were, of different pieces and materials that \ncan be augmented or deleted, remade, restructured and so forth. Before entering the highly \nselective and purposeful world of the modern workplace, modern humans have been forged \nin a fashion that makes them capable of decomposing the bits and pieces that they are made \nof, leaving behind all those materials (i.e. roles and skills) that do not fit the context they are \ncalled upon to monitor. Modernity prepared the requirements for this sort of human being and \nit was itself embedded as a cultural system by it. As cogently put by Ernest Gellner contem-\nporary man is modular, i.e. is composed of bits and pieces that are agglutinative and can be \nsupplemented but also reshuffled, recombined, replaced and modified as the circumstances \nmay demand. This sort of human being, Gellner (1996: 101-102) goes on to claim, is:  \n \n\u2018(T)ransplantable and replaceable...capable of performing highly diverse tasks in the same cultural \nidiom, if necessary by reading up manuals and specific jobs in the general standard style of the culture \nin question.\u2019 \n \nThe distinctive character of the modern workplace is inextricably bound up with the anthro-\npological construct of modular human, which the bureaucratic form of organization helps to \nembed. Only modular humans can respond to the widely varying and shifting demands under-\nlying the contemporary world and fit the operational requirements of modern organizations. \nThe highly selective and standardized behaviour underlying the bureaucratic form of organi-\nzation is inconceivable without the decomposability of human agency and the proclivity of \ncontemporary humans to suspend non-role demands when enacting particular roles. But the \nmodel of human agency fashioned by modularity is not simply a presupposition for success-\nful role taking that responds to the internal contingencies of the workplace. It also circum-\nscribes the assignment of environmental events to various realms. It thus contributes to the \ndisambiguation of the premises of interaction with other purposeful agents in the environment \nof the organization. The organization\u2019s interaction with the environment takes place along \nhighly selective paths too (Luhmann 1995). \nThe adaptive significance of the modular constitution of modern humans spans the entire \nspectrum of contemporary life and is by no means restricted to formal organizations. An im-\nportant message of this article is that the anthropological foundations of the bureaucratic or-\nganization are part and parcel of the social order of modernity. In a minutely differentiated \nsocio-economic world, whose various contexts demand specific responses, modularity be-\n 17\ncomes the sine qua non of adaptability and survival. The adequate separation of the role from \nthe person represents the anthropological invention through which modern humans become \nfit to live a life that involves frequent criss-crossing of different contexts. By assuming vari-\nous roles that remain loosely connected to their core personality (or the illusion of such a \ncore), contemporary humans can fashion themselves in ways that respond to the specific \nfunctional and normative requirements of individual contexts and specific situations. Existen-\ntial ambiguity is thus mastered with a sort of loose coupling at the anthropological level. \nParaphrasing March and Olsen (1989), it would be possible to claim that life events are seg-\nmented and dealt with concurrently or sequentially, by invoking different courses of action \nthat derive from various \u2018regions\u2019 of the contemporary person. \nModern human beings can thus be seen as portfolios of roles, to use another imagery, in-\nvested in different projects. The varying significance attached to these projects is partly the \noutcome of the various contingencies surrounding the individual biographies and partly the \nexpression of the cultural orientations underlying distinct historical periods. While modernity \nitself fashioned modern humans as modular, the relative significance attributed to various \nmodules and the life projects associated with them signifies perhaps distinct phases of mod-\nernity itself (e.g. early, middle and late modernity). As we will claim in the last section, the \ndistinctive mark of the current age is the expanding importance of decisions associated with \nwork and occupation issues, at the expense of the relative importance traditionally attributed \nto family and community (Carnoy 2000). Despite the fact that this claim needs to be empiri-\ncally substantiated, the way the relative issues are conceptually framed is of decisive signifi-\ncance with respect to which aspects of the referential reality will eventually come to enter \ninto consideration and subjected to measurement. For that reason alone, they deserve a seri-\nous pre-empirical treatment.  \nThe conception of contemporary humans as modular comes to a sharp contrast with pre-\nmodern ways of being human. Pre-modern life undoubtedly contained contexts of achieve-\nment marked by different presuppositions that thus demanded various specialized responses. \nYet, as indicated in the preceding pages, pre-modern people were modular only in an elemen-\ntary fashion (Gellner 1996). Home and workplace were not often adequately differentiated \nfrom one another while status-based stratification severely limited individual mobility and \nshifting commitments. The major qualities and characteristics of pre-modern humans were \ntightly coupled to one another and enacted, by and large, en block, a condition that signifi-\ncantly inhibited the formation of specific responses, and limited adaptability and the easy \ncriss-crossing of social contexts.  \n 18\nThe conception of modern humans as modular may even contrast with neo-romantic psy-\nchologism that sustains an image of man as monolithic, coherent substance in a command \n(admittedly incomplete) of a private and interiorized space. The conception of contemporary \nhumans as modular is not however a description of a psychological process, even though it \nmay have consequences for the way we understand the modern self. It does not even refer to \nthe microtechniques of subjectivity making (Foucault 1977, 1980, 1988; Rose 1996; Townley \n1995), widely debated these days. Rather, it is here offered as an anatomy of the anthropol-\nogy of modernity and the organization forms it accommodates. Microtechniques of subjectiv-\nity making usually develop within the wider context of relations brought about by the anthro-\npological predispositions of modernity and the conception of modern humans as modular \n(Hirschman 1977; Luhmann 1995; Pottage 1998). \nThe fashioning of modern humans as modular involved a series of liberations from forces that \nprecisely inhibited their mobility and adaptability (Gellner 1983; Giddens 1990, 1999). To be \nfashioned as modular, modern people had to be de-substantialized (Pottage 1998), i.e. de-\nanchored from the limitations which tradition and nature imposed on them. This way they \nbecame ready to act on the basis of considerations exclusively fabricated by the social order \ninto which they found themselves. Sociality thus emerges as freedom from necessity (Arendt \n1958). Most significantly, human behaviour in modern life had to become increasingly de-\nemotionalized and decoupled from the complex and time demanding processes of psycho-\nlogical or personal reorientation. The separation of the role form the person is essential to the \nde-emotionalization of social action. While ultimately unsurpassable, emotions like grief, \npassion or joy should be refrained from contexts other than deeply private. They could be \nperhaps tolerated if they were expressed with moderation. Yet, in general, emotions of this \nsort should not determine human behaviour in public places. In the wider public sphere and \nthe workplace, human behaviour ought to obey the logic of tempered consideration, task ori-\nentation and calculation (Hirschman 1977). \nIt goes perhaps without saying that the prospect of the behavioural machine that seems to co-\nincide with the conception of contemporary humans as modular may be far from an attractive \nportrait of the humankind (Mangham 1995). It certainly violates a widespread though perhaps \nna\u00efve ideal of humanism. Let it be clear, though, that the fashioning of modern humans as \nmodular is essential to the separation of the various spheres of social life sustaining modern \nliberty (du Gay 2000; Gellner 1996). Despite that, the conception of modular human is not \noffered here as an ideal to be pursued, at least no without qualifications. Rather it is intended \nas a description of the unspoken anthropology of modernity and the bureaucratic organiza-\n 19\ntion, closely tied to key elements of current developments in employment and organization \nforms. The institutional construction of modular persons contains undoubtedly positive and \nnegative elements together and must be evaluated against the complex background of rela-\ntions, which it presupposes. Says Gellner (1996: 104) himself:   \n \n\u2018(T)here is the price of isolation of one activity from another, a kind of fragmentation which leaves \neach activity unsustained by the others, cold and calculated by its own clearly formulated end, rather \nthan part of a warm, integrated \u201ctotal culture\u201d. Such \u201calienation\u201d or \u201cdisenchantment\u201d is a price which \nsome consider too high.\u2019 \n \n \nAddendum on Modularity \n \nThe social innovations of the bureaucratic form of organization and the model of human \nagency associated with it constitute part of the wider historical context within which current \ntrends in work and employment develop. The understanding of the distinctive qualities of key \nhistorical antecedents of current developments provides an essential means for appreciating \nthe impact they are bound to have on individuals and organizations. Despite widespread over-\ntones tying bureaucracy to stability, rigidity and centralization, we have endeavoured to show \nin the preceding sections that mobility, selectivity and adaptability are essential elements of \nthe organizational order of modernity. They are reflected in the ways human agency and or-\nganization are fashioned to deal with the shifting states of a world that is constantly underlain \nby contingencies of various kinds. The bureaucratic form accommodates and is being ac-\ncommodated itself by the model of human agency we subsumed under the notion of modular \nman.  \nHowever, the overtones of stability and inertia associated with bureaucracy and the modern \nworkplace have not been wholly unjustified. The significance which enduring occupational \nand organizational relations normally assumed in modern people\u2019s life combined with the \nlegal regulation of work and the formation of labour contracts through collective bargaining \nto obscure the malleability and adaptability of the social conventions tying humans to organi-\nzations (Hasselbladh 2000). Other social institutions like the nuclear family constrained the \noccupational mobility of women, while surviving elements of class identification, corpora-\ntism and the segmentation of labour markets limited the social and, by extension, the occupa-\ntional mobility of individuals in general (Beck 1992; Gellner 1983). These constraints have \n 20\nnevertheless been loosened considerably in the course of modernity to allow increasingly \ngreater human mobility and frequent institutional boundary crossing. Indeed, part time work \nand other time-limited forms of employment have been around for more than half a century \nand modern capitalism has always entertained a pantheon of labour contracts and employ-\nment relations, the centrality of the standard labour contract notwithstanding (Tilly and Tilly \n1998). The employment forms that have been emerging during the last two decades and the \nfeminization of labour markets could therefore be seen as rooted in developments that have \nbeen taking place for quite long time.  \nThus, current trends would seem to entertain a rather complex and ambiguous relationship to \nthe organizational order of modernity. Indeed, it would be possible to claim, contrary to \nwidespread assumptions on the decline of bureaucracy, that current developments mark the \naccentuation of the core characteristics of the bureaucratic order that were here identified \nwith mobility, selectivity and adaptability. Only if bureaucracy is identified with fordism or \ntaylorism could one perhaps infer the close of the bureaucratic age. But this basically indus-\ntrial model of organization (i.e. fordism or taylorism) always entertained a tense relationship \nto the bureaucratic form (du Gay 2000). The unquestionable administrative innovations intro-\nduced by fordism or taylorism (Chandler 1977) were always underlain by a sort of paternal-\nism and custodial practice that carried into modernity cultural conventions and significations \nwith clear pre-modern origins. As the history of trade unionism shows, paternalism and cus-\ntody often violated not only labour law but even constitutional rights (Perrow 1986). Organ-\nizational practices of this sort bypassed the egalitarian ethos of the bureaucratic form and \nconstrained human mobility so essential to the modular anthropology onto which the organ-\nizational order of modernity is predicated (du Gay 1994, 2000, 2001; Kallinikos 2001). \nAnd yet, in another sense current developments do seem to challenge the foundations of \nmodernity and the bureaucratic form of organization. Aligned with the claims put forth in the \npreceding sections, we would like to stress that the shifts in employment and organization \nforms currently underway could not be adequately understood in sheer functional terms \nalone. Rather, they are the sign of wider cultural and social change that finds its expression in \nthe reordering of the relative significance of the components that have comprised the typical \nportfolio of individual life projects in modernity. Modular man is refashioned to express and \naccommodate the priorities of an age that reorders the significance which work, family, \ncommunity and wider social involvement have traditionally assumed. Several interrelated \ntrends can be distinguished in this respect. The first relates with the decline of the nuclear \nfamily consequent upon gender equality, the feminisation of labour markets and the eventual \n 21\nde-collectivization of family relations, where family members increasingly decide and carry \nout individually their own decisions (Beck 1992; Giddens 1999; Fukuyama 1997). A second \ntrend concerns the considerable weakening of the sense of community (e.g. neighbourhood \nrelations, local engagement) as the result of contemporary people\u2019s frequent geographical \nmoves (Beck 1992; Carnoy 2000; Sennett 2000). Two crucial and separate spheres of social \nlife (i.e. family and community) that conditioned work, employment and organization forms \nrather heavily are thereby changing, both requiring and producing increasingly mobile and \nflexible relations.  \nA third group of developments derives from work itself and concerns the rising importance, \nwhich issues of work and occupation currently obtain in the life space of individuals. Major \nindividual decisions are increasingly made on the basis of expectations about future employ-\nment and the pay-offs thereby calculated. Education is regularly framed in terms of invest-\nment in vocational skills, while training and occupational experience are evaluated in terms \nof their contribution to better and financially more rewarding future possibilities. Once, an \nimportant yet single section of life, work, conceived now as investment in occupational skills \nand experiences, tends to monopolize the entire horizon of individual\u2019s decisions. It sub-\nsumes an impressing array of issues, deriving from other domains (including family and \ncommunity) with distinct priorities and modes of conduct, to its own model of calculation (du \nGay 2000; Gordon 1991; Hasselbladh 2000). The separation of work from the rest of peo-\nple\u2019s life is thereby undermined, and the anthropological foundations of the bureaucratic or-\nder are subject to a remarkable twist. A paradox is seemingly involved in this respect. The \nexpanding significance of decisions related to work and occupation goes hand in hand with \nthe decline of the work ethic of enduring physical or mental exertion and asceticism that after \nWeber has been associated with modernity (Sennett 2000). Calculative regulation tends to \nreplace the normative prescriptions of the protestant ethic (Luhmann 1982, 1995), as the \npractices and significations that derive from the conception of life as investment in occupa-\ntional skills or experiences are gradually disseminating across the social fabric.  \nWhether these trends signify the intrusion of market relations into individual life situations \nthat have remained beyond the regulative jurisdiction of market governance (Beck 1992; \nGordon 1991; Luhmann 1982) remains to be seen. What is however evident is that the \nboundaries of major yet separate institutional domains of contemporary life are substantially \nredrawn. In this process, the premises underlying the modular constitution of modern humans, \nessential to accommodate the distinct logic and modes of conduct associated with each one of \nthese domains, are by necessity redefined. Modularity is loosing the social anchoring it has \n 22\nhad into the separate realms of work, family and community. It is less and less fashioned to \naccommodate the distinct logics and modes of conduct associated with these separate realms \nof social life. Modular human agency is increasingly framed in terms of the enterprising of \nlife (du Gay 2000). Instead of guaranteeing the freedoms of modern polity, it tends to end up \nas a sheer functional devise of adaptability that no longer recognizes the distinct demands \nassociated with work, family, community and public life in general.  \nThe increasing significance of work and the redrawing of the boundaries separating it from \nother social domains is also expressed by a number of subtle and apparent innocent shifts in \nmanagerial modes of governance. Subsumed often under the label of human resource man-\nagement, a new system of practices and significations seeks to reshape the terms by which \ncontemporary humans are involved in organizations. It does so in ways that question the \nseparation of the working self from people\u2019s other faculties and projects. Reversing the tradi-\ntional modern and bureaucratic recipe by which humans are involved in organizations qua \nroles, contemporary human resource management appears to demand their participation qua \npersons of a very specific kind (Hasselbladh 2000). A whole arsenal of techniques prescribes, \nrecommends and eventually fashions a model of human agency that conceives humans as re-\nsources that must be effectively utilized and continually developed to contribute to the wel-\nfare of the organization.  \nIn contemporary human resource management, the category of resource dissolves the distinc-\ntive practical status underlying most human faculties and the differential semantics associated \nwith them. It thus becomes the common denominator to which they must ultimately be re-\nduced. Nearly all human skills, proclivities or experiences can be employed and utilized with \nthe exclusive purpose of expanding their individual and organizational utility, without imme-\ndiate concern for the widely different domains of personal and social life with which they \nhave been traditionally associated. For instance, sociability (i.e. a characteristic of communal \nlife) or sexuality (private life) can be employed to promote the interests of the organization \n(e.g. sales, business relationships) while education and knowledge acquisition must steadily \nprove their instrumental and commercial viability, beyond any contribution to personal wel-\nfare. Similarly, free time, dedicated to family or other personal interests, can ideally be given \nto the organization in exchange for better present rewards or future opportunities. While these \ncharacteristics were certainly present in the typical order of modernity, they are not viewed as \naberrations any longer. They have diffused throughout the social fabric and have become le-\ngitimate and normal ways of conducting one\u2019s life. \n 23\nHRM represents a separate and quite complex chapter of organizational practice that unde-\nniably deserves its own lengthy treatment. However, we cannot avoid mentioning the conse-\nquences HRM has for the central issues that concern us here, most notably the social and an-\nthropological foundations of the bureaucratic form of organization. Though perhaps not im-\nmediately evident, the impressive diffusion of HRM during the last two decades is closely \nassociated with the recent developments in employment forms that were considered in this \narticle. On the one hand, HRM practices and recommendations of the sort mentioned above \ntend to blur the boundaries of separate domains of social life. They thus indirectly challenge \nthe modular constitution of humans and the selective, mobile and reversible terms by which \nthey have been tied to organizations. On the other hand, techniques and recommendations \nlike outsourcing, contingent work utilization and rentable labour treat work as any other in-\nput, i.e. as a utilizable and substitutable resource. They thus re-enhance the exchangeability \nof human involvement in organizations and promote a functional and rather dry model of \nmodularity (Carnoy 2000). Both options seem to violate crucial principles of the bureaucratic \norganization and the forms of human agency that have been associated with it. They induce \nthe categorization of employees to two distinct groups to be treated in a diametrically \ndifferent fashion (Tilly and Tilly 1988).  \nThus understood the meaning of the celebrated word \u2018flexibility\u2019 becomes an ambiguous one. \nIt would be perhaps possible to conjecture that novel employment forms may contribute to \nthe liberation from older institutional and organizational forms of subordination and the \nempty rituals of formality that are often thought to accompany the bureaucratic form of or-\nganization (Kelly 1996; Lash and Urry 1994). But bureaucracy, as we have tried to show \nhere, is much more complex social accomplishment than what is often implied by stereotyped \nimages of rigidity and centralization. Indeed, the shifts in work, employment and organiza-\ntion forms that are built solely on the isolated premise of flexibility may threaten important \nfoundations of liberty and pluralism underlying the modern social edifice (du Gay 2000, \n2001). The separation of work from other crucial domains of modern life that sustained the \nbureaucratic order was certainly a functional principle. However, above all, it was a way of \nliving, in a world with many and competing sets of values. \n \n \nConclusion \n \n 24\nIn the present article we have endeavoured to show the social and cultural complexity that is \nassociated with current developments in employment and organization forms. Despite im-\npressive historical variation, the organization of work has always been a key aspect of life, \nramifying into a complex web of relations with other social and cultural institutions or proc-\nesses (Arendt 1958). Not surprisingly, then, the consequences of current developments and \nthe issues that are stake must be appreciated on the background of sober reflection over the \ndistinctive character of the bureaucratic order and the institutional or social relations that \nhave supported it. Current shifts in employment and organization forms do not simply ac-\ncommodate the need for greater individual and organizational flexibility. They cannot be \ngauged in functional or managerialist terms alone. Rather, they are themselves the manifesta-\ntion of a deep going cultural reorientation that brings about important changes in the institu-\ntional edifice (i.e. employment and organization forms, models of human agency) that has \nregulated or shaped work in modernity. They must be ultimately evaluated against the back-\nground of the complex web of institutional relations out of which they have emerged and \nwhich they nevertheless cannot help but challenge. \n \n \nReferences \n \nArendt, Hannah \n1958 The human condition.
