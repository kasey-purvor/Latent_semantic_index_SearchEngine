INTRODUCTION\nPDS 456 is a luminous low-redshift ( ) radio-quietzp 0.184\nquasar identified in 1997 (Torres et al. 1997). The optical and\ninfrared spectra (Simpson et al. 1999) show broad Balmer and\nPaschen lines (e.g., Hb FWHMp 3000 km s\u00011), strong Fe ii,\na hard (dereddened) optical continuum ( ), and one\u00010.1\u00020.1f \u221d nn\nof the strongest \u201cbig blue bumps\u201d of any active galactic nucleus\n(AGN; Simpson et al. 1999; Reeves et al. 2000).\nPDS 456 has a dereddened absolute blue magnitude of\n(Simpson et al. 1999), making it at least as luminousM \u2248 \u000127B\nas the radio-loud quasar 3C 273. Indeed, PDS 456 is the most\nluminous known AGN in the local universe ( ), its lu-z ! 0.3\nminosity being more typical of quasars at , at the peakzp 2\u20133\nof the quasar luminosity function.\nPDS 456 was first detected as the X-ray source RXS\nJ172819.3\u0001141600 in the ROSAT All Sky Survey (Voges et\nal. 1999). Subsequent ASCA, Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer\n(RXTE), and BeppoSAX observations showed that it was highly\nX-ray variable (Reeves et al. 2000, 2002), requiring that the\nX-ray source was very compact (less than 3 Schwarzschild\nradii) and accreting with an unusually high efficiency (between\n6% and 41%), close to the limit for a rotating Kerr black hole\n(Thorne 1974). The X-ray spectrum of PDS 456, obtained by\nASCA and RXTE, also appeared to be unusual for a quasar. A\nstrong edgelike feature was present in the iron K-shell band,\ndue to either a highly ionized absorber or reflector, while ab-\nsorption toward the soft X-ray band was also observed (Reeves\net al. 2000). An XMM-Newton observation of PDS 456 was\nsubsequently obtained in AO-1, in order to obtain high signal-\nto-noise spectra of both the iron K-shell complex with the\nEuropean Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) CCD detectors and\na high-resolution spectrum of the soft X-ray absorber with the\nXMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS). Here\nwe report on the X-ray spectra obtained through the XMM-\n1 Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics, NASA Goddard Space Flight\nCenter, Code 662, Greenbelt Road, Greenbelt, MD 20771; jnr@milkyway\n.gsfc.nasa.gov.\n2 Universities Space Research Association.\n3 X-Ray and Observational Astronomy Group, University of Leicester,\nLeicester LE1 7RH, UK.\nNewton observations of PDS 456, which reveal evidence for\na massive outflow, with a velocity of \u223c50,000 km s\u00011. A pre-\nvious paper (Reeves et al. 2002) discussed in detail the X-ray\nvariability during the XMM-Newton observation and a simul-\ntaneous week-long BeppoSAX observation.\n2. THE X-RAY OBSERVATIONS\nPDS 456 was observed by XMM-Newton on 2001 Febru-\nary 26 with a duration of 40 ks. Data were taken with the EPIC-\npn detector (Struder et al. 2001) in full window mode and with\nthe EPIC-MOS detector (Turner et al. 2001) in large window\nmode. The data were reduced using version 5.4 of the XMM-\nSAS software. Note that the time-averaged 0.5\u201310 keV flux of\nPDS 456 during the observation was ergs cm\u00012 s\u00011;\u0001129.7# 10\nat this flux level the effect of photon pileup is small (!1%). All\ntime intervals were included, as the observation contained no\nbackground flares. Data were selected using event patterns 0\u201312\n(for the MOS) and patterns 0\u20134 (for the pn), and only good X-\nray events were included. The spectra were extracted from cir-\ncular source regions of 40\u0001 radius, while background spectra\nwere extracted from an offset circle, close to PDS 456, but free\nof any background sources. Response matrices and ancillary\nresponse files were generated using the SAS tasks RMFGEN\nand ARFGEN, respectively.\nBackground-subtracted spectra were fitted using XSPEC ver-\nsion 11.2, including data over the energy ranges 0.4\u201312 keV for\nthe EPIC-pn and 0.4\u201310 keV for the co-added EPIC-MOS spec-\ntrum. A Galactic absorption column of cm\u0001221N p 2# 10H\n(Dickey & Lockman 1990) was included in all the fits. A single\nabsorbed power-law fit (photon index ) to both MOSGp 2.0\nand pn data is clearly inadequate (reduced ). Figure 12x p 10\nshows the data\/model ratio to this power law; a strong soft excess\nis observed below 1 keV and a large drop in counts is observed\nabove 7 keV in the iron K-shell band. The MOS and pn spectra\nare consistent, except below 0.5 keV, where there is a small\ndivergence in spectral slope.\nL66 REEVES, O\u2019BRIEN, & WARD Vol. 593\nFig. 1.\u2014Ratio of the broadband X-ray spectrum of PDS 456 to a simple\nGalactic absorbed power-law model (with ). EPIC-pn data are plottedGp 2.0\nin black, EPIC-MOS in gray. A clear soft X-ray excess is observed below\n1 keV, as well as a large decrease in counts above 7 keV. The inset plots the\ndata\/model ratio to a power-law fit to the 2\u201312 keV EPIC-pn spectrum in\ngreater detail. A 50% drop in counts above the iron K-shell band is observed.\nNote that the energy scale is plotted in units of keV in the observed frame.\nFig. 2.\u2014Warm absorber fits to the EPIC-pn data of PDS 456 using the XSTAR\nphotoionization code.

At this high ionization,log yp 3.5\nthe model cannot reproduce the shape of the iron K-shell absorption seen in\nPDS 456.\n3. THE IONIZED ABSORBER IN PDS 456\nInitially, to model the iron K-shell band, the data were fitted\nfrom 2\u201312 keV (or 2\u201310 keV for EPIC-MOS), so that the\neffects of the large soft excess are negligible. As the EPIC-pn\ndata contained significantly more counts than the EPIC-MOS\nat the highest energies, we proceeded to fit the EPIC-pn data\nonly. The ratio spectrum above 2 keV to a power law fitted\nover the 2\u20135 keV range (i.e., outside of the iron K band) is\nshown in the inset to Figure 1. A strong deficit of counts occurs\nabove 7 keV, where one would expect to observe K-shell ab-\nsorption edges from highly ionized iron. Indeed, a simple Ga-\nlactic absorbed power law produced a poor fit ( 2x \/degrees of\n; null hypothesis probabilityfreedom [dof]p 1001\/746 9#\n).\u00011010\nAdding three absorption edges between 7 and 10 keV sig-\nnificantly improves the fit ( ), modeling the2x \/dofp 739\/740\nbroad Fe absorption feature present in the X-ray spectrum. The\nenergies (in the quasar rest frame) and optical depths of the\nedges are then keV, keV, andEp 9.3\u0002 0.1 Ep 8.5\u0002 0.2\nkeV with , ,Ep 7.6\u0002 0.3 tp 0.56\u0002 0.11 tp 0.26\u0002 0.11\nand , respectively. The breadth of the ab-tp 0.24\u0002 0.08\nsorption feature suggests that a wide range of ionizations may\nbe present, while the depth of the feature implies a column of\ngas of cm\u00012. Note that the upper limit to a narrow24N \u223c 10H\n(i.e., unresolved) Fe emission line (in the energy range 6.4\u2013\n6.97 keV) is less than 12 eV, implying that the solid angle\nsubtended by the absorber must be small ( sr). NoteQ ! 0.5\nthat an extreme broad iron Ka emission line from an accretion\ndisk cannot model the shape of the spectrum from 2 to 12 keV.\nIf one attempts to model the spectrum with a Fe line profile\nfrom a rapidly rotating Kerr black hole (Laor 1991), the phys-\nical parameters required are unphysical (disk emissivity ,\u000110R\ninclinationp 90\u0003, equivalent width 11 keV), because the line\nis (unsuccessfully) attempting to model the broad absorption\ndip above 7 keV with the blue wing of the line profile.\nTo obtain a more physical representation of the Fe K-shell\nabsorber, we used a grid of models generated by the XSTAR\nphotoionization code (Kallman et al. 1996) to fit the EPIC-pn\ndata above 2 keV. Solar elemental abundances were assumed,\nwhile a turbulence velocity of 1000 km s\u00011 was used. A one\nzone photoionization model was adopted, with the column den-\nsity (NH), ionization parameter (y), partial covering fraction\n( f ), and outflow velocity ( ) as free parameters. An effectivevout\nhydrogen column density (for a solar abundance H\/Fe ratio)\nof cm\u00012 is required, together with an ionization\u00022.0 235.7 # 10\u00012.5\nparameter of and a partial covering fractionlog yp 2.5\u0002 0.3\nof , while the power-law continuum steepens tof \u223c 0.6 Gp\n. At this ionization state, most of the absorption is2.40\u0002 0.05\ndue to Fe xvii\u2013Fe xxiv (i.e., where the L shell is partially\nfilled). The best-fit spectrum modeled by XSTAR is shown in\nFigure 2a, the depth and energy of the absorption feature being\nwell matched, while the partial covering warm absorber also\nmodels the convex spectral curvature (through the increase in\nopacity at lower energies due to iron L-shell absorption) present\nin the EPIC-pn data between 2 and 6 keV. Overall, the fit\nstatistic for this model is excellent ( ).2x \/dofp 717\/740\nImportantly, a large outflow velocity of 47,000 km s\u00011 (90%\nconfidence limits, 36,000\u201382,000 km s\u00011) is needed to model\nthe spectrum. Although the exact outflow velocity is not well\nconstrained by the EPIC-pn data alone, a significant outflow\nvelocity is still required. Figure 2b illustrates this point; if one\nNo. 2, 2003 MASSIVE X-RAY OUTFLOW IN PDS 456 L67\nFig. 3.\u2014XMM-Newton RGS-2 spectrum of PDS 456; the data points are\nshown as plus signs. A strong absorption trough is present at 12\u201315 A\u02da , observed\nframe. The best-fit photoionization model (solid line) is superimposed on top\nof the data points; a high outflow velocity of \u223c50,000 km s\u00011 is required for\nthe absorber. Note that because of a malfunctioning chip, RGS-1 does not\ncontaining data in the 12\u201315 A\u02da range and thus is not plotted. Most of the\nopacity of the absorber results from L-shell transitions of iron in the ionization\nrange Fe xvii\u2013Fe xxiv.\nfixes the absorber velocity to zero, then the model fit becomes\npoor, as the iron K edges then lie at a significantly lower energy\nthan is observed in the EPIC data. Indeed, if one tries to in-\ncrease the energy of the model absorption feature by increasing\nthe ionization state of the absorber (so that He- and H-like iron\ndominates), the result is a worse fit still, partly because the\nabsorption edge feature becomes weaker (as a significant frac-\ntion of iron becomes fully ionized) and also because the most\nprominent absorption features are now the strong Ka and Kb\nabsorption lines due to Fe xxvi, which are not present in the\nactual XMM-Newton data (Fig. 2c). Thus a significant outflow\nvelocity is required by the data; indeed, one can place a con-\nservative lower limit (at 99.9% confidence) on the velocity of\n24,000 km s\u00011 (or \u223c0.08c).\n3.1. The Soft X-Ray RGS Spectrum of PDS 456\nExtrapolation of the hard X-ray spectrum to lower energies\n(down to 0.4 keV) leaves clear residuals in the EPIC-MOS and\npn data (e.g., Fig. 1). A strong soft excess is present below\n1 keV, while residuals due to an additional absorber may also\nbe present in the soft X-ray band. To investigate this at higher\nspectral resolution, we used data available from the RGS below\n2 keV. The most noticeable feature present is a broad absorption\ntrough observed between 12 and 15 A\u02da (see Fig. 3). The feature\nis highly significant, being detected at greater than 99.99%\nconfidence. When parameterized by a simple broad Gaussian-\nshaped absorption line, the best-fit parameters (in the quasar\nrest frame) are keV with an equivalent widthEp 1.07\u0002 0.02\nof eV and a velocity width of km s\u00011.26\u0002 10 9000\u0002 3000\nAs in the previous section, we used our grid of photoioni-\nzation models to characterize the properties of the absorbing\ngas, apparent in the RGS spectrum. A lower column density\n( cm\u00012) is required to fit the data, while both a22N \u223c 5# 10H\nsimilar ionization parameter ( ) and outflowlog yp 2.6\u0002 0.5\nvelocity (with km s\u00011) are needed, as per\u00028000v p 57,000\u000110,000out\nthe fits to the EPIC-pn data. Partial covering is not required in\nthe RGS fits. The photon index obtained ( , after cor-Gp 2.4\nrecting for absorption) is consistent with the EPIC-pn data,\nwhile a soft blackbody component (with eV)kT p 80\u0002 6BB\nis also needed in the fit. The lower column density derived\nfrom the RGS fit indicates that the absorber is patchy and thus\nis likely to be located quite close to the X-ray source. Thus\nwe see a higher (partially covered) column along the line of\nsight toward the hard X-ray continuum, while the column to-\nward the soft X-ray continuum is lower.\nInspection of the best-fit photoionization model implies that\na blend of L-shell transitions from Fe xvii to Fe xxiv as well\nas K-shell absorption from Ne ix to Ne x is responsible for\nthe broad absorption feature at 12\u201315 A\u02da . A weak Lya absorp-\ntion line due to O viii may also be present at 19 A\u02da . The outflow\nvelocity derived appears robust, because of the positioning of\nthe broad absorption feature. If one fixes the absorber velocity\nat zero in the quasar rest frame, then the Fe L-shell absorption\nin the model is located at energies below the observed ab-\nsorption trough, while increasing the ionization of the absorber\nonly serves to significantly weaken the soft X-ray absorber.\n4. DISCUSSION\nX-ray spectroscopy of PDS 456 with XMM-Newton has re-\nvealed a high column density ( cm\u00012) highly23N p 5# 10H\nionized ( ) warm absorber, its main signature beinglog yp 2.5\na series of K- and L-shell absorption edges and lines due to iron\nin the ionization range Fe xvii\u2013Fe xxiv. Crucially, a near-\nrelativistic outflow velocity is required, of the order of 50,000\nkm s\u00011. This velocity is similar to the actual systemic velocity\nof PDS 456 (at ); therefore, it is possible that thezp 0.184\nabsorbing material is unrelated to the quasar and is local to our\nGalaxy. However, we consider it extremely unlikely that such a\nhigh-column highly ionized absorber could occur by chance\nalong the local line of sight. Furthermore, although the Galactic\ncolumn toward PDS 456 is moderately high ( 21N p 2# 10H\ncm\u00012), this neutral absorption does not contribute toward the\nfeatures seen in the iron K- and L-shell bands and, in any event,\nhas been accounted for in all our modeling. Therefore it is highly\nprobable that the absorber is intrinsic to the quasar PDS 456.\n4.1. A Massive Outflow in PDS 456\nThe combination of a large column density, high ionization,\nand a fast outflow velocity in PDS 456 indicates that the ab-\nsorber is located close to the quasar\u2019s central engine and that\nits mass outflow rate is significant relative to the accretion rate.\nA maximum distance to the absorber can be calculated on the\ncondition that its thickness (DR) cannot exceed its distance from\nthe ionizing source (R), i.e., . This requires thatDR\/R ! 1\n(where ) for a black hole mass of4 2R ! 10 R R p GM\/cg g\n109 M, for PDS 456 (Reeves et al. 2000); thus, it is located\nwithin the broad-line region. One likely possibility is that the\nabsorber arises through a disk-driven outflow or wind. The\nexact origin of these winds and the mechanism responsible for\ndriving them (radiation and\/or magnetic) is unclear. For broad\nabsorption line (BAL) quasi-stellar objects, line-driven winds\nhave been proposed (Murray et al. 1995; Proga, Stone, & Kall-\nman 2000) as well as centrifugal driving along open magnetic\nfield lines (Bottorff et al. 1997).\nUsing conservation of mass, the outflow rate ( ) for an\u02d9Mout\noutflow subtending a solid angle of Q steradian with a constant\nvelocity is given by , where n is the2\u02d9v M p Qnr v mout pout out\ndensity, r the distance from the X-ray source, and mp the proton\nmass. Now the ionization parameter y is defined as yp\n, so we can obtain .2 \u02d9L \/nr M p Qv m L \/yX out p Xout\nFrom the observations, the hard X-ray luminosity of PDS\nL68 REEVES, O\u2019BRIEN, & WARD Vol. 593\n456 (above 2 keV) is \u223c1045 ergs s\u00011 and the ionization param-\neter is , while km s\u00011. From the lack ofy \u223c 1000 vp 50,000\nany iron K line emission it is likely that the outflow subtends\na solid angle of less than 0.5 sr. However, even for a con-\nservative value of 0.1 sr, the mass outflow rate derived is\ng s\u00011 or \u223c10 M, yr\u00011. A lower limit of26\u02d9M p 8# 10out\n\u223c5 M, yr\u00011 is obtained using the 99.9% confidence lower\nbound on the outflow velocity of km s\u00011. Notev p 24,000out\nthat the outflow rate calculated assumes that the gas is in equi-\nlibrium; if the gas is being accelerated then the actual rate may\ndiffer.\nPDS 456 is an extremely luminous quasar with a bolometric\nluminosity of ergs s\u00011 and a black hole mass of47L \u223c 10bol\n109 M,, assuming that accretion occurs near the Eddington\nlimit (Simpson et al. 1999; Reeves et al. 2000). The mass\naccretion rate for PDS 456, given by , is \u223c20 M,2\u02d9Mp L \/hcbol\nyr\u00011, for an efficiency of . Thus it seems likely thathp 0.1\nthe outflow rate is of the same order as the mass accretion rate\nin PDS 456. Similarly, the kinetic output of the outflow in PDS\n456 is large, about 1046 ergs s\u00011, corresponding to 10% of the\nbolometric output of the quasar. The high velocity also implies\nthat the outflow is likely to be driven from the accretion disk\nat a fairly small radius. For a Keplerian disk, the launch radius\nfor the outflow is simply , where is the22R p c \/v R vout gesc esc\nescape velocity of the material. Assuming that (al-v \u223c vesc out\nthough some acceleration of the matter will probably occur),\nthis implies that the outflow in PDS 456 is launched from a\nradius of \u223c40Rg (about 1016 cm for a 109 M, black hole).\nIndeed, the launch radius may be smaller if the gas is not in\nsimple equilibrium.\nPDS 456 appears to be in a small but growing group of AGNs\nto show extreme absorption properties in the iron K-shell band.\nThe lensed BAL quasar APM 08279\u00025255 has been found to\nexhibit iron K absorption lines and\/or edges (Chartas et al. 2002;\nHasinger, Schartel, & Komossa 2002) in both Chandra and\nXMM-Newton observations. A similar absorber has also been\nreported in the BAL quasar PG 1115\u0002080 (Chartas, Brandt, &\nGallagher 2003). The outflow velocities are similar to PDS 456,\nin the range (0.1\u20130.4)c. Given this apparent association between\nhigh-velocity X-ray outflowing gas and the UV BALs, one may\npredict to see BAL features in the UV spectrum of PDS 456.\nIndeed, a Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging\nSpectrograph spectrum of PDS 456 (P. T. O\u2019Brien et al. 2003,\nin preparation) reveals that there may be cooler gas in the out-\nflow; a BAL is seen in Lya with an outflow velocity of\n12,000\u201322,000 km s\u00011, while the C iv emission line is also\nblueshifted by \u223c5000 km s\u00011. Thus PDS 456 may reside just at\nthe extreme end of the BAL quasar population (Turnshek et al.\n1988; Weymann et al. 1991).\nSimilar highly ionized X-ray outflows have recently been\ndiscovered in the non-BAL radio-quiet quasars PG 1211\u0002143\nand PG 0844\u0002349 (Pounds et al. 2003a, 2003b), suggesting\nthat these properties are not unique to UV-identified BAL qua-\nsars. We also note that strong iron K absorption has also been\nobserved in the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies 1H 0707\u0001495\nand IRAS 13324\u00013809 (Boller et al. 2002, 2003) and also in\nsome X-ray binaries, e.g., GRS 1915\u0002105 (Lee et al. 2002),\nGX 13\u00021 (Sidoli et al. 2002), and X 1624\u0001490 (Parmar et\nal. 2002). In the quasars PDS 456, PG 1211\u0002143, and PG\n0844\u0002349, the X-ray columns are near to 1024 cm\u00012, the outflow\nvelocities measured are \u223c0.1c, while the ionizations are also\nsimilar ( ). Using PG 1211\u0002143 as an example, King &3y \u223c 10\nPounds (2003) have recently demonstrated, for radiatively driven\noutflows, that objects accreting near to the Eddington rate are\nlikely to contain massive ( ) Compton-thick winds.\u02d9 \u02d9M \u223c Mout Edd\nIndeed, when the outflow rate is of the same order as the\naccretion rate, the flow can become optically thick at\n\u223c(10\u2013100)Rg. This can account for both the high columns and\nthe velocities of the X-ray outflows as well as provide a natural\nsource of thermalized photons for the UV and soft X-ray excesses\nobserved in these quasars.\nHowever, other scenarios are possible; for instance, Reeves\net al. (2002) recently used a magnetic flare model to explain\nthe rapid X-ray variability in PDS 456, through coherent flaring\nevents occurring when the accretion rate is close to Eddington.\nIndeed, it is conceivable that the outflowing matter in PDS 456\nis the ejecta associated with these flares. Interestingly, the out-\nput of the magnetic events (\u223c1046 ergs s\u00011) in PDS 456 is very\nsimilar to the kinetic power of the outflow, so this scenario\nseems energetically plausible. Overall, the extreme properties\nof the outflow in PDS 456 seem linked to its high accretion\nrate (Reeves et al. 2000), which appears to drive the energetics\nof its unusually massive outflow.\nThis Letter is based on observations obtained with XMM-\nNewton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contri-\nbutions directly funded by ESA Member States and the US\n(NASA).
