The assessment and development of project management competence in\nChina are driven by attempts to follow the Western standards-based competence certification programmes. Yet little\nis known about whether and how the predefined set of knowledge embodied in the Western standards are used by\nChinese project managers in their workplace. In this paper we report an empirical exploration of Chinese construction\nproject managers\u2019 ways of conceiving and accomplishing their work. We replicate in the Chinese context the previous\nUK-based phenomenographic study of construction project management competence, which revealed three different\nconceptions arranged in a hierarchy of performance. The results of this China-based study confirm the conceptual\ndeterminants of construction project management competence first revealed in the UK, and provide practical\nimplications for effective training and professional certification of project management competence in China. Meanwhile, the\nreplication of the phenomenographic approach to understanding project management competence in China enhances the\ncross-cultural validity of the approach and highlights its potential for explorative management research.\nKeywords: Competence; Conceptions; Phenomenography; China\n1. Introduction\nModern forms of project management originated in the Western aerospace and defence sectors in the late 1950s and\n1960s, and became more dispersed in the 1970s most notably in construction-related work. Since then the discipline has\ngrown in refinement and recognition, to the extent that most large Western organizations now regard project\nmanagement as an important organizational capability. There are now a number of well-established project management\nstandards that define the scope of the discipline and describe its theories, processes, tools, and techniques. These\nstandards are now widely used as the basis for assessing, developing and certifying project management competence [1].\nAlthough China started to import the concepts and skills of project management from the West in the 1 960s, these were\nnarrowly confined to major national defence research projects such as the strategic missile system [2]. However, since the\nChinese economic reforms of the 1980s, project management theories and practices have become increasingly\nrecognized in China, particularly in construction-related work. Now, the assessment and development of project management\ncompetence in China are driven by attempts to follow the widespread Western standards-based professional competence\ncertification programmes. Prominent recent examples of this trend include the launch of PMI\u2019s PMP examination\nand certification programme in 2000, and the IPMA\u2019s programme in 2001 [3].\nThe use of project management standards for professional competence assessment and development in the West and their\ntransposition into the Chinese context are based on the assumption that management practices are context-independent\nand universal. This premise may be questioned, since the pre-defined context-free knowledge and principles embodied in the\nstandards specify only what competent project managers should know and do rather than whether and how project\nmanagers use these knowledge and principles in accomplishing their work. There is a clear opportunity and need to\nunderstand Chinese practicing project managers\u2019 ways of conceiving and experiencing Western originated project\nmanagement work within the Chinese context.\nIn a previous study, Chen and Partington [4] took an interpretive approach based on the principles of phenomenography\n[5,6] to explore project managers\u2019 ways of experiencing and accomplishing their work, thereby understanding the\ndeterminants of their performance in the workplace. From their interviews with 30 project managers in UK construction\nfirms, Chen and Partington [4] identified three different basic conceptions of project management work, reflecting a\nhierarchy of three forms of construction project management competence in the UK.\nThis paper reports a replication of Chen and Partington\u2019s [4] UK-based phenomenographic study through a matched\nsample of project managers from Chinese construction firms. In the next section, we first discuss the determinants of\nproject management competence and give a brief summary of Chen and Partington\u2019s [4] previous study. We then review\nthe conception-based approach to understanding competence, known as phenomenography, and describe the methods\nand results of this study in China. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings for practice and\nfuture research.\n2. The determinants of project management competence\nTaylor [7] was one of the first to address the question of what constitutes competence at work, and his well-known \u2018time and\nmotion studies\u2019 were based on scientific principles. Although later authors [8,9] used \u2018job analysis\u2019 instead of \u2018time and\nmotion studies\u2019 to identify competence at work, the dominant approach follows essentially the same scientific attribute-\nbased tradition. Two principal traditional approaches to competence at work can be distinguished: worker-oriented and\nwork-oriented. The former emphasizes workers\u2019 attributes, such as knowledge, skills and abilities, and personal traits [10],\nwhilst the latter treats work as existing independently of the worker, definable in terms of the technical requirements of\nwork tasks [11]. Nevertheless, both traditions view competence as an attribute-based phenomenon, constituted by a\nspecific set of generic and context-independent attributes, which do not determine practical competence in\nexperiencing and accomplishing work [4].\nThere have been many studies of project management competence aiming at identifying determinant factors and\/or\ncriteria for a successful project or a competent project manager [12\u201315]. Most of these studies accord with attribute-based\napproaches, focusing on either the project work activities (work-oriented) or the personal characteristics of project\nmanagers (worker-oriented). Project management competence is described as a specific set of attributes, either \u2018hard\u2019\ncomponents of a standard or \u2018soft\u2019 characteristics hidden in personal qualities [4]. Such lists of attributes described in project\nmanagement standards and the predefined sets of generic performance criteria are necessary for defining the scope of the\ndiscipline and providing foundations to further develop the profession. However, being independent of the context of\nproject management work and independent of individual project managers, they cannot capture project management\ncompetence in the workplace.\nIn order to overcome the criticisms of the current attribute-based studies of project management competence, Chen and\nPartington [4] followed the phenomenographic approach focusing on the relation between the work and the worker,\nnamely, worker\u2019s conceptions of work, to understand project management competence from a conception-based\nperspective. From their workplace interviews with 30 construction project managers in the UK, those authors identified\nthree different basic conceptions of construction project management work, namely project management as: (1) planning\nand controlling; (2) organizing and coordinating; and (3) predicting and managing potential problems. Each conception\nincludes a different main focus and key attributes that appeared when project managers experienced and accomplished their\nwork. Differences in conception reflect a hierarchy of three forms of conception-based construction project management\ncompetence in the UK [4, p. 420]. By taking project management work and project managers as a unified entity, their\nstudy revealed the conceptual determinants of construction project management competence in the UK.\n3. The conception-based approach to competence \u2013 phenomenography\nOriginally developed by an educational research group at the University of Goteborg in Sweden in the 1 970s,\nphenomenography is a research approach \u2018for mapping the qualitatively different ways in which people experience,\nconceptualize, perceive, and understand various aspects of, and phenomena in, the world around them\u2019 [16, p. 31].\nBeing different from the traditional attribute-based approaches, the main feature of the phenomenographic approach is\nits basis on phenomenology, which assumes that \u2018person and world are inextricably related through people\u2019s lived\nexperiences of the world\u2019 [6, p. 11]. In phenomenography, knowledge is neither subjective nor objective but both, namely,\nthe subject and the object are internally related [17]. When people experience something, they do it on a social, intellectual\nand emotional level simultaneously. Knowledge is therefore regarded as context dependent. Experience of the\nsurrounding world is a base for understanding; people are consequently involved at all times in an interaction with their\nworld. Learning occurs when people understand and experience something in a way different from their previous\nunderstanding and experience. In this sense, in phenomenography, where conception means \u2018a specific aspect of\npeople\u2019s ways of experiencing, or making sense of, their world\u2019 [5, p. 47], learning represents a qualitative change from\none conception to another.\nFundamental to the phenomenographic approach is the idea that people experience and understand various aspects of, and\nthe phenomena in, the world around them in qualitatively different ways. Instead of focusing separately on the\nphenomenon being investigated and the people who are experiencing the phenomenon, phenomenography is concerned\nwith the relation between the two, namely, people\u2019s conceptions of the phenomenon. The outcome of a phenomenographic\nstudy is a set of categories of conceptions that describe a certain phenomenon. These conceptions are drawn from the\nanalysis of empirical data and based on the most distinctive features that differentiate one conception from another.\nThey are presented in the form of a hierarchy that reflects increasing levels of understanding and provides a basis for\ndecisions about teaching and assessment.\nA large number of phenomenographic studies in educational learning [18,19] and teaching [20,21] have now been conducted\nand the identified categories of conceptions are usually linked in a hierarchical relationship. In recent years, the\nphenomenographic approach has been increasingly applied outside the educational context in fields such as health care,\nacademic freedom, leadership, and competence. Notable examples include Sandberg\u2019s [5,6] study of competence at work that\nrevealed three hierarchical conceptions of engine optimization work, Partington, Pellegrinelli and Young\u2019s [22]\nresearch into programme management competence, and Chen and Partington\u2019s [4] study of construction project\nmanagement competence in the UK introduced above.\n4. Method\nThe sample of this study consisted of 30 project managers selected from 10 construction firms in the Beijing area of\nChina. In order to provide a matched stable context for capturing project managers\u2019 conceptions of their work, the\nsample selection criteria set out in Chen and Partington\u2019s [4] previous study in the UK were closely followed in this\nstudy. For example, all the samples were from Chinese construction contractor companies that undertake projects for\ncustomers; they were working on the construction site together with a project team, with subcontractors and suppliers\nusually employed for accomplishing the project; the projects they were working on were mainly of building or\nroad\/bridge construction works without high technology being involved. Table 1 lists a summary of the samples\u2019\ndemographic information of this study in China.\nFollowing the phenomenographic approach [6,16,23], data were collected by in-depth interviews. The interview questions\nwere \u2018as open-ended as possible in order to let the respondents choose the dimensions of the question they want to answer\u2019\n[16, p. 42]. Throughout the interview process, respondents were encouraged to describe and explain their experience and\nideas as fully as possible. We used the same interview protocol as developed in the previous study in the UK [4], listed in\nTable 2. All the project managers were interviewed on the job site of their current project. All interviews were recorded\nand transcribed word-for-word. Notes were made both during and after each interview.\nTable 1 - A summary of samples\u2019 demographic information\nSample (n = 30)\nAge 20s\n30s\n40s\n1\n19\n10\nTypes of projects Buildings\nRoad\/bridges\nUtilities\/facilities\n23\n3\n4\nEducation Degree\nNo degree\n18\n12\nTable 2 - Interview guide\nWarm-up questions:\n\uf0b7 Could you please talk me through your career to date?\n\uf0b7 Could you tell me a little further about your work on this project?\nPrincipal questions:\n\uf0b7 What does project management work mean to you?\n\uf0b7 What is a competent project manager to you?\nFollow-up questions:\n\uf0b7 Could you give me an example?\n\uf0b7 What do you mean by that?\n\uf0b7 Could you explain that further?\n\uf0b7 How did you deal with that?\nAlternative questions:\n\uf0b7 What are the most important aspects of project management work?\n\uf0b7 What is the most important task of a project manager?\n\uf0b7 Could you describe to me a good project manager you know?\n\uf0b7 If you are now involved in recruiting a new project manager for your company,\n\uf0b7 What are the most important criteria you will look at?\n\uf0b7 What aspects of the project have been successful? What made them successful?\nEnd questions:\n\u2022 What do you enjoy most about your work? Why? Example?\n\u2022 What do you enjoy least about your work? Why? Example?\n\uf0b7 Is there anything else you would like to say about your work?\nThe process of phenomenographic analysis is often described as a \u2018discovery\u2019 [24]. Despite the claim that there can be no\nalgorithms for a process of discovery, there are clear guiding principles that lead to a certain commonality in approach [16].\nSome important interpretive guidelines include: (1) an orientation towards the phenomenon and how it appears throughout\nthe research process; (2) seeking to describe the experience under investigation, rather than trying to explain it; (3)\nhorizontalizing the material being analysed \u2013 treating everything which is said as being of equal importance; (4) seeking\nstructural features in the experience under investigation; (5) using intentionality as a correlational rule (looking at what\nis focused on and how it is represented [25, p. 210]. Meanwhile, the emphasis on an iterative process involving looking at the\ndata from different perspectives or foci at different times is the most common method [16]. The various foci can include\nfocusing on the how and what aspects of the phenomenon under investigation and similarities and differences within and\nbetween categories and transcripts associated with particular categories, and so on [23].\nFollowing the above guidelines, the analysis of the interview transcripts in this study involved an ongoing iterative process\nalternating between what the project managers conceived of their work and how they conceived of that work, described briefly\nbelow.\nFirst, we read each transcript several times to get familiar with the transcript and try to grasp each project manager\u2019s\ngeneral conception. According to their general conceptions we grouped initially the project managers. In this phase, two\ngeneral conceptions emerged, one focusing on dealing with resources on site, another focusing on relationships with parties and\npeople involved in their work. Second, we read all the transcripts again to systematically search for what each project\nmanager conceived of their work focusing not only on the statements concerning essential aspects of their work but\nalso on the meaning of a particular statement in relation to its embedded context. Following this initial interpretation of\neach transcript, we shifted the analysis from individual project managers and compared conceptions across project\nmanagers, first within and then between the groups established in the first phase of the analysis. This process led to some\nregrouping. In particular, the comparison within the group focusing on relationships led to its division into two new groups,\none focusing on coordinating relationships, the other on both coordinating and developing new relationships. Third, we\nanalysed all the transcripts again, but in terms of how each project manager conceived of their work. After we had\nanalysed each transcript, we compared the project managers with each other, first within and then between groups. The\nindividuals were grouped and regrouped by progressively identifying their main focus and how they utilized what\nthey conceived as important in accomplishing their work. Finally, to cross-check and further stabilize the identified\nconceptions, we analysed all the transcripts once again, focusing simultaneously on what each project manager conceived of\nand how they conceived of their work.\n5. Findings\nWe identified three different conceptions of project management work in China, which were project management as: (C1)\nplanning and controlling, (C2) coordinating relationships, and (C3) developing relationships. The project managers expressing\neach conception differed from each other through their ways of experiencing and accomplishing their work. They delimited\nand organized project management work in terms of certain essential attributes, but with a different focus, forming different\ncharacteristic features of each conception. Further, within different conceptions, attributes represented different\nmeanings and approaches. We describe each conception, its main focus, and the meaning of its key attributes, respectively,\nbelow, supported by typical examples of statements in the data.\n5.1. Conception C1: project management as planning and controlling\nThe most characteristic feature of this conception was that individuals expressing it delimited and organized project\nmanagement work in terms of essential attributes focusing on the construction work process. This focus implied that all\nthese project managers\u2019 key attributes were centred around the details of work on site. The key attributes constituting this\nconception included: ability to plan, knowledge of construction work, knowledge of commercial management, ability to\ncommunicate, and ability to manage team.\n5.1.1. Ability to plan\nWithin C1, this attribute meant the ability to plan the construction work sequence, including the procurement and delivery\nof resources to site, such as labour, materials and equipments, so that the progress and the cost of the project could be\ncontrolled. This was one of the most fundamental attributes of this conception.\nI think the most important thing is to plan and then to ensure the implementation of the plan on site. Without a good plan,\nthe project manager would be blind, and it is therefore impossible for him to manage the project properly. (Q: Could\nyou explain that a little further?) Well, for example, the first thing I did here for this project was to produce an overall\nplan, which must be done as early as possible. You need to know the kinds of people and other resources needed, then\nyou can plan the procurement of these resources and the subcontracting of certain tasks. For example, how many tower\ncranes are needed? One or two? For how long? And from when? These may look trivial, but you must understand the\nfact that if they are not planned and organized properly, any of these small things could cause a big delay to the work\nprogress and could cost a lot more money in the end. (ZXL)\n5.1.2. Knowledge of construction work\nIn order to plan the construction work and control the whole process well, project managers expressing conception C1\nconsidered it essential for them to have good knowledge of construction work. By this they meant being familiar with the\nconstruction work process and being aware of the technical requirements of the work task on site.\n..actually a project manager\u2019s management competence depends very much on his technical knowledge of the construction\nwork. (Q: Can you give an example?) For instance, with concreting, it is not enough to just know whether and when there is\na concreting job on site. First, you need to be aware of the relevant technical specifications, and at the same time you need\nto consider the transportation distance, the concreting speed, the slump, and so on. With all this knowledge, you can\nnegotiate and sign a proper contract with the supplier, and you can be there to control the concreting process on site.\n(ZBH)\n5.1.3. Knowledge of commercial management\nFor C1 project managers, this attribute meant understanding the fundamental business rules and practices in contract\nnegotiation and signature, so as to procure the necessary resources at a lower price and get them delivered to the\nconstruction site as scheduled.\nIt is all about getting the right things at the right time at a lower price. So first you have to plan very carefully, plan the\nwhole work and plan how to procure and when to deliver the required resources to the construction site. Thus you must\nalso have good knowledge about how to negotiate and sign a contract. You need to understand the fundamental rules and\npractices in business. So I always say the project manager should have both technical knowledge and commercial\nknowledge. (WKL)\n5.1.4. Ability to communicate\nC1 project managers considered the ability to communicate to be another key attribute. They communicated with people\nworking on site by holding regular meetings so that they could check and control the planned work tasks. They emphasized\npersonal communication with people, so that they could work closely as a \u2018team family\u2019.\nIt is a hard job. But the project manager is not a decoration to the office. You need to go out to communicate with your\npeople, with subcontractors, and work together with them... Whenever I have time I like to go out to have a\nlook at the job site, to check the progress and say hello to people, not always going with a clear purpose, but always\ncoming back with valuable information. We also hold regular meetings to check the progress, and to discuss and find\nsolutions to problems. (LYL)\n5.1.5. Ability to manage team\nWithin conception C1, this attribute meant to manage the relationships within the team on site, to get the team united and\nintegrated as a big family. They considered themselves to be like the father.\nWell, people are the most important. In the past, in the \u2018Maoist era\u2019, we always said \u2018if united, people can overturn the\nheaven and the earth\u2019. Now we do not say such slogans, we follow the West and use the term \u2018teamwork\u2019, but to me,\nthey mean more or less the same, that is to unite and work together towards a goal everyone desires. So the project\nmanager needs to be able to get people united and integrated as a team. The team is like a big family on site, and you are\nlike the father of the family. So you need the kind of personal traits to integrate people. You need to care about their\nworries and thoughts, and be able to manage the relationships between people within the team. (ZXL)\n5.2. Conception C2: project management as coordinating relationships\nProject managers holding this conception focused on the relationships of all people relevant to the project, particularly\nthose who were carrying out different types and parts of the work on site. Compared with C1, these project managers\nexpressed another new attribute: ability to coordinate. At the same time, although these project managers still agreed\nwith the importance of planning for good project management, it was not a central attribute. The key attributes\nconstituting this conception included: knowledge of construction work, knowledge of commercial management, ability to\ncommunicate, ability to manage team, and ability to coordinate.\n5.2.1. Knowledge of construction work\nFor C2 project managers, this attribute meant understanding not only the work process and technical requirements, as in\nC1, but also how different types and parts of the work interfaced and how every subcontractor\u2019s work related to each other.\nThus, they could see the big picture and coordinate the relationships between people carrying out the different tasks without\ninterfering with the technical requirements and the progress of the overall project.\nA good project manager needs to have technical knowledge of the construction work. Most project managers nowadays\nhave got formal education from universities. They may start from working as an engineer or assistant project manager...\nThey can understand every aspect of the construction work, and how different types and parts of the work interface and\nrelate to each other... Thus, they can see the big picture, organize the work on site and coordinate relationships of\nall parties involved. (ZTO)\n5.2.2. Knowledge of commercial management\nIn conception C2, this attribute meant understanding not only the fundamentals of business administration as in C1,\nbut also the commercial side of the project and the relevant commercial constraints in the contract.\nWell, quality, time, and cost are the three aspects that project manager needs to control. So you must know both the\ntechnical requirements and the commercial constraints. Most importantly, you need to be able to coordinate\nrelationships of people involved in the project, so that cash flows efficiently between the client, the company and\nthe subcontractors without delay, and every party works well without delay. It is not an easy job, so you need to\nstudy the contract, being fully aware of the commercial side of the project... It depends very much on the project\nmanager\u2019s knowledge of and experience in business administration, and his social skills in coordination. (ZLQ)\n5.2.3. Ability to communicate\nC2 project managers communicated with people by all possible means. They stressed gaining mutual understanding and\nbuilding trust, in order to manage and coordinate relationships.\nIn most cases, all people on site work under pressure, such as time constraints. As a consequence, misunderstandings\nand conflicts are unavoidable. So the project manager needs to take all possible opportunities to communicate with people,\nto build trust with each other, and to coordinate relationships. Very often, you are misunderstood, but you cannot\ncomplain, although everyone can come and complain to you. Now, it is popular to say \u2018long live understanding\u2019. I\nwould say \u2018long live understanding our project managers\u2019. (WAP)\n5.2.4. Ability to manage team\nC2 project managers considered teamwork essential to their work, including the ability to build a team and create a team\nspirit on site. For them, teamwork was not only about getting people work together as a close family as that in C1, but\nalso creating a spirit of mutual support, trust, and openness.\nWe are a team, and we have been working together for many projects. To me, we are like a big family and they are\nmy people, my own family members... The company may make some adjustments when organizing the team\nfor a new project... You need to create a kind of spirit of mutual support, trust and openness in your team, so that\nthe new members can join and unite into the team quickly. (CLY)\n5.2.5. Ability to coordinate\nWithin conception C2, this attribute meant the ability to coordinate relationships of everyone relevant to the project. C2\nproject managers understood people and could communicate with different people. They tried to manage and coordinate\nrelationships so that the project could progress without delay and be accomplished in a good environment.\nBasically most of my time is spent on coordinating relationships, both internal and external relationships. The control of\nthe work on site depends mainly on my team... (Q: What do you mean by \u2018internal\u2019 and \u2018external\u2019 here?)\n\u2018Internal\u2019 usually refers to our own company and site team, and \u2018external\u2019 may refer to the client, subcontractors,\nsuppliers, as well as the relevant local authorities. So, I mean all those involved in the project. The project manager\nmust be able to communicate with them, manage and coordinate relationships with them, and try to maintain a good\nenvironment for the project to be accomplished without delay. (ZZL)\n5.3. Conception C3: project management as developing relationships\nAs with C2, the main focus of conception C3 was also relationships, but in a way that was more future-oriented. The most\nessential aspect of C3 project managers\u2019 work was being able to build and develop new relationships, reflected by a\nnew attribute in this conception, the ability to build new relationships. The key attributes constituting this conception\nincluded: knowledge of construction work, knowledge of commercial management, ability to communicate, ability to manage\nteam, ability to coordinate, and ability to build new relationships.\n5.3.1. Knowledge of construction work\nFor C3 project managers, this attribute meant having knowledge of not only the construction process on site but also\nthe development of the industry, in particular the availability of new technology and materials. They could give\nsuggestions to the client to utilize new technology and methods in the work, so as to build good client relationships.\nAs a project manager, you must be more experienced than others.... You must be aware of the development of\nthe industry such as the availability of any new technology and advanced methods. Thus you are able to give the\nclient good suggestions. The client would appreciate it very much if they get good suggestions from the contractor, and they\nwould come back to you for new projects. That\u2019s what we hope to gain from this project. (XSG)\n5.3.2. Knowledge of commercial management\nCompared with the previous two conceptions, these C3 project managers had a broad vision and better knowledge of the\nmarket. They were concerned not only with making profit from the current project, but also with the future development of\nthe company.\nThe competition for new projects is fierce... In most cases, the final contract price is lower than the reasonable\none. So project managers usually work under great tension to accomplish the work as required in the contract and to\nmake profit for the company. (Q: How do you deal with this then?) I expend a lot of energy and time on the\ncommercial management of the project. From planning, subcontracting, to detailed methods, I have to control the\nfinancial aspect of the work and coordinate among different parties to achieve more with less cost and making sure it is\nwithin the budget. (SWH)\n5.3.3. Ability to communicate\nApart from those aspects of communication mentioned by C1 and C2 project managers, C3 project managers\nemphasized the ability to communicate with all kinds and levels of people, particularly with those they did not know before.\nThe most successful aspect up to now would be the good relationships we have built with the client. Although this is the\nfirst project we have done together, and I did not know anyone in the client\u2019s company before the project, we found a\nway to communicate with each other and build trust with each other... You need to possess the kinds of\npersonalities and skills to talk with people, to convince them and to build good relationships. (CMF)\n5.3.4. Ability to manage team\nIn addition to the team management activities mentioned by C1 and C2 project managers, C3 project managers attended\nalso to team development. They motivated team members and encouraged them to keep studying and improving\nthemselves.\nAnother task of the project manager is to keep the team motivated, to ensure that people work on their own initiative...\nThere are so many temptations outside the project site, so you cannot simply tell people what they should or should\nnot do, particularly the young generation. But you can influence them. For example, I organize regular meetings and\nstudying workshops... I also encourage my team to attend training courses organized by the company. (XSG)\n5.3.5. Ability to coordinate\nWithin conception C3, this meant the ability to coordinate relationships of all people relevant to the project. Compared\nwith C2, C3 project managers were more future-oriented in that they tried to coordinate before problems and\nconflicts occurred.\nFor example for this project, I spent a lot of time and put a lot of effort into coordinating relationships with local\nresidents... If they were against you and this project, the site work could hardly proceed peacefully as scheduled. So\nyou need to understand and foresee problems and be able to coordinate relationships to avoid problems and conflicts\noccurring... The client appreciated very much our efforts and we are building a very good relationship with our\nclient as well. (CMF)\n5.3.6. Ability to build new relationships\nC3 project managers considered building and maintaining good relationships to be essential for accomplishing the current\nproject and gaining resources and advantages for the company to win more projects in the future.\n...you can learn from those training courses [to be certified as a Class I project manager] the techniques and methods\nof how to manage a project, but you cannot learn how to be a good project manager. Because being a good project\nmanager, you need the kind of skills and ability to build and maintain good relationships with the client, the local\nauthorities and so forth. (FFZ)\n5.4. Summary\nAs demonstrated above, within each conception, the meanings of all its key attributes were internally related to each\nother and centered around its main focus, forming a specific structure of competence in project management with these key\nattributes being the essential aspects of competence. The way each conception and its key attributes formed a distinctive\nstructure of project management competence is shown in Table 3 and illustrated below taking conception C1 as an example.\nC1 was characterized by its main focus on the construction process and work details on site. Project managers expressing\nthis conception planned the work sequence and produced a master plan showing all the important milestones. They\nthen prepared detailed monthly and weekly plans, according to which they organized the work on site and controlled the\nprogress and cost of the project.\nTable 3 - The way each conception and its key attributes formed a distinctive structure of project management competence in China\nKey attributes of conception and aspects of competence\nConception Main focus Ability to plan Knowledge of\nconstruction\nwork\nKnowledge of\ncommercial\nmanagement\nAbility to\ncommunicate\nAbility to\nmanage team\nAbility to\ncoordinate\nAbility to\nbuild new\nrelationships\nC1:\nProject\nmanagement as\nplanning and\ncontrolling\nConstruction\nprocess and\nwork details\nPlan the work;\nControl the\nwork process\nand cost of the\nproject\nUnderstand the\nconstruction\nprocess and\ntechnical\nrequirements\nfor the work\ntask\nUnderstand\nfundamental\nrules and\npractice in\nbusiness\nnegotiation and\nadministration\nBy regular\nmeetings;\nHave personal\ntalks with\npeople and\ncare about\npeople\nMaintain good\nrelationships\nwithin team;\nGet the team\nunited and\nwork closely\nlike a family\nC2:\nProject\nmanagement\nas coordinating\nrelationships\nRelationships C1+\nUnderstand\nthe work\ninterfaces; Be\naware of\npeople\u2019s\nrelationships.\nC1+\nBe aware of\nthe contract;\nUnderstand\ncommercial\nimplications of\ncoordination\nC1+\nBy all\npossible\napproaches;\nGain mutual\nunderstanding\nand trust\nCreate a\nteam spirit;\nCoordinate\nrelationships\nbetween new\nand old\nteam\nmembers\nCoordinate\nrelationships of\nall people;\nEnsure work\nprogress well\nC3:\nProject\nmanagement\nas developing\nrelationships\nNew\nrelationship\nFuture-\noriented\nC2+\nKnow the\nconstruction\nindustry; Be\naware of the\nhistory and\nfuture\ndevelopment\nof the industry\nC2+\nBe aware of the\nmarket and\npotential\nopportunities\nfor the future\ndevelopment of\nthe company\nC2+\nCommunicate\nwith all kinds\nand levels of\npeople, with\npeople\nunknown\nbefore\nC2+\nMotivate the\nteam to learn\nand to improve\nthemselves; Be\nmore\ncompetitive\nC2+\nCoordinate\nbefore\nproblems and\nconflicts occur\nThink forward;\nBuild new\nrelationships;\nContribute to\nthe future\ndevelopment\nof the\ncompany\nThis was the fundamental aspect that also required and depended on the other aspects of this conception. In order to plan\nthe work and ensure the implementation of the work without delay, they needed to understand the construction process\nand to be aware of the technical requirements for each work task. They also understood the fundamental business\nrules and practices, so that they could arrange the procurement of resources and get the required resources delivered to\nsite as planned. In order to check and control the work progress, they communicated with people by regular meetings on\nsite. Meanwhile, they cared about people working with them on site, and tried to keep up personal communication to get\npeople united and work closely as a team. Therefore, it can been seen that the meanings of the five key attributes within this\nconception were internally related to each other and centered around planning and controlling the work on site forming a\ndistinctive structure of competence in construction project management work in China.\nFurther, the variation in meaning from C1 to C2 to C3 can be arranged as a hierarchy of competence in terms of\nincreasingly comprehensive forms of conception. From C1 to C2 and C3 the work was expanded cumulatively which\nsuggested that C1 was least comprehensive, C2 more comprehensive than C1, and C3 the most comprehensive. This was more\nevident through the key attributes of each conception, namely the essential aspects of each form of competence. As illustrated\nin Table 3, each conception consisted of a different set of attributes, and the same attribute meant different things to the project\nmanagers holding different conceptions. A variation of meanings of same attributes in different conceptions demonstrated a\ncumulative and hierarchical relationship.\n6. Discussion and conclusions\nWith the increasingly spread of Western standards-based project management professional competence certification\nprogrammes in China, it is worth exploring Chinese project managers\u2019 ways of experiencing and accomplishing their work,\nand thus to understand their competence at work. By replicating Chen and Partington\u2019s [4] previous UK-based\nphenomenographic study of construction project management competence, this study demonstrates how Chinese\nconstruction project managers\u2019 ways of experiencing their work, namely, their conceptions of their work, determine their\ncompetence at work. The research findings suggest that whether and how the predefined set of knowledge embodied in the\nWestern standards are used by Chinese construction project managers in their workplace are preceded and determined by\ntheir conceptions of that work. With different conceptions, Chinese project managers attach different meanings to the\nattributes and organize the attributes into a distinctive competence in performing their work.\nThus, the findings of this study in China confirm the conceptual determinants of construction project management\ncompetence in the workplace first revealed in Chen and Partington\u2019s [4] previous study in the UK. Further, the\nreplication of the phenomenographic approach to understanding project management competence in China enhances the\ncross-cultural validity of the approach and highlights its potential for explorative management research. Meanwhile,\nthe research findings reported here provide practical implications for effective training and professional certification of\nproject management competence within the Chinese context. It is our hope that the findings of this study will provide fresh\ninsight for Chinese government and professional organizations to develop and update project management competence\nassessment and development programmes relevant to construction project management work within the Chinese context.\nThis may also have implications for designing and conducting effective training courses on construction project\nmanagement in China. Moreover, variations in the forms of conceptions and meanings attached to each conception in the\ntwo nations highlight the cultural impacts on project management work performance that has implications for further in-\ndepth research.\nThe findings of this research are, of course, based on data from a single industry in China, and caution should be\nexercised in generalizing the findings to contexts other than construction projects in China.\nAcknowledgement\nProject 50539130 supported by NSFC.\nReferences\n[1] Crawford L.
