The analysis of these business \ncases is used to highlight the typical strategic responses of firms to the unstable business \nenvironment in the region. It is argued in the paper that the transition to market economy is \naccompanied by multiple business risks to firms, and these risks have obstructed the \nadjustment, re-positioning, and restructuring of firms and their business networks. Our \nselection of cases demonstrates the strategic attempts by firms to transform their relationships \nnot only with buyers and suppliers, but also with foreign partners, financial institutions, and \ngovernmental bodies. As a result of our comparative analysis, a new typology of business \nnetworks is developed, including: transformed business networks, and newly established \nbusiness networks. \n \nKey words: \nbusiness networks; international business strategies in Eastern Europe; enterprise \nrestructuring and adjustment; business environment in Central and Eastern Europe. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe recent debates on privatisation and company restructuring in Central and Eastern \nEurope have been entirely dominated by the argument that privatisation is the only means for \nenterprise restructuring. Our secondary analysis of a number of published case studies aims to \nhighlight a new dimension of the transition process, and to introduce the argument for the \nstructural dependencies and barriers for change, usually underestimated in the academic \nliterature. We analyse the factors reported in the cases that determine the company \nperformance, and particularly those related to government policies, industrial linkages, and \nmanagerial strategies for survival in a turbulent environment.  \n The concept of \u2018business network\u2019 is used in this paper to describe the regular and \nrepetitive transactions that an enterprise maintains with its suppliers and buyers within the \nvalue chain (see also Porter, 1991). The term \u2018network\u2019 includes the complexity of relations \nbetween companies, based on past contractual arrangements and present business links. The \ninformation on these linkages is rarely reported in the published cases. However, through a \nsecondary analysis of the available information we highlight some of the main enterprise \nlinkages, and their transformation under the new market conditions.  \n As a result of our comparative analysis, we have developed a classification of the \ncases in two main groups: a) \u2018transformed business networks\u2019 \u2013 comprising of cases of old \nfirms that have gone through a period of significant changes, and that have successfully \naltered their position on the market, and their relationships with buyers and suppliers; and b) \n\u2018newly established business networks\u2019 - newly established companies that have radically \nchanged their range of buyers and suppliers. In addition, the companies\u2019 linkages are \nclassified into national and international networks, according to their access to markets.  \n The conceptual framework for the analysis of the adjustment behaviour of firms is \nbased on a number of theoretical arguments: a) the role of the Central Plan in the design of \n                                                          \n1 In: The Journal of East-West Business, Vol. 6, N. 2, 2000, pp. 95-129. \n \n 2\nvalue chains; b) the role of the transition macro-economic environment, and its effect on \nfirm\u2019s performance; and c) the effect of the withdrawal of the state on firm\u2019s strategies. The \nfunctioning of the Central Plan during the socialist period has established structural links \nbetween firms that have forced them into vertically and horizontally integrated production \nsystems. These interlinked enterprises resemble business networks closely co-ordinated by \nthe Central Plan. Some of the key mechanisms of this co-ordination are discussed in the \nfollowing paragraphs.  \nThe turbulence of the macro-economic environment during the transition period \nincreased the business risk for individual firms. We give an overview in this paper of the \nsources of business risk, and the additional barriers on firms to restructure and reposition \nthemselves on the market. The collaps of the Central Plan and the withdrawal of the state \nfrom control and regulation exposed firms to the intense market competition and increases \ntheir transaction costs. The strategic responses of the established firms illustrate typical \nbehaviour in transition economies, and highlight the structural dependencies inherited from \nthe central planning period. \n \nTHE DESIGN OF BUSINESS NETWORKS  \nBY THE CENTRAL PLAN \n \nOne of the main functions of the Central Plan in the former socialist economies was to \nfacilitate the transactions between firms. All of their inputs and outputs were pre-determined \nand inter-linked in a huge economic chain, driven by specified targets. The economic targets \nwere measured by the \u2018planners\u2019 to satisfy broadly defined social needs. Therefore, under the \nCentral Plan, there were no input or output markets, as firms were linked by the state \nadministration to their input suppliers and output buyers. \n All relationships of the individual firm in the past were pre-determined by \nadministrative decisions. Kornai (1992) points out that fundamental decisions for the \nestablishment of a firm, or its liquidation, for appointment, promotion and dismissal of \nmanagers, for the allocation of products, materials and labour, for price setting and financial \nregulation, for investment and technical development, for foreign trade and international \neconomic relations - all were taken entirely by administrative bodies and individuals from the \npolitical and administrative elite. Needless to say that the Central Plan in this capacity \nreduced dramatically transaction costs for firms, and provided certainty for the realisation of \ntheir outputs.  \nThe State Central Plan in the past was implemented through a number of \nintermediaries, responsible for the co-ordination and supervision of all economic activities of \nthe firms. Some of the key \u2018insiders\u2019 therefore resided outside of the firm. After the collapse \nof the central planning system, the individuals working in these intermediaries were best \npositioned to take over the role of co-ordinating agents that are capable to manage the \neconomic transactions between firms. \n What might be called the nomenclature, or the individuals that comprise of the civil \nservice and part of the \u2018political functionaries\u2019 of the socialist system, possessed the intimate \nknowledge for the allocation of resources within the economy (Willerton, 1992, Todeva, \n1996). The nomenclature had the entire control of the information on economic transactions, \nmarket demand, differences in prices, and new business opportunities within the home \nmarket. They had also contacts with international business partners. It is not accidental that a \nlarge proportion of the early entrepreneurial activities were launched by the former \nnomenclature. \n The intermediaries in the past, such as: Ministry of Planning, the State Council, The \nCouncil of Ministers and the Central Bank, served as buffers, absorbing shocks between the \n 3\noutput from the state firms and the market demand. All of the intermediaries were involved in \ndifferent stages of the design of the Central Plan, and the required subsequent alterations. \nWith the collapse of the Central Plan, the functions of the intermediary institutions were \ndisrupted, and the firms were exposed directly to the market. While state firms gained \nautonomy in this process, they also faced a resource dependency, under the conditions of \nuncertainty and lack of information. The resource dependency was due not only to the lack of \nfinancial capital, but also to the limited choice of suppliers that firms had inherited from the \npast, and from previous contractual relationships and obligations. \n \nTHE TURBULANCE OF THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT  \nDURING THE TRANSITION \n  \nThe collapse of the socialist system at the end of the eighties is most clearly associated with \nthe failure of the administrative system and the Central Plan to co-ordinate efficiently the \neconomic activities. The inability of the state to facilitate reliable transactions between firms, \nto provide incentives for innovation, to exercise control over dysfunctional managerial \nbehaviour, and to obtain adequate feedback on policy implementation and the effectiveness \nof specific investment policies, was evident in each country of the eastern block.  \n The opening of the socialist economies to the global competition, and the subsequent \ncollapse of the Central Plan, exposed firms to the uncertainties of the market. This was \nfurther exacerbate by the collapse of trade between the former CMEA1 countries, the drastic \ndecline of the home market demand, the price liberalisation with the subsequent increase of \ncosts of all inputs, the trade liberalisation, which increased foreign competition in almost all \nsectors of the economy, and the intensive tax reforms that further de-capitalised the firms.  \nThe reduction of state intervention was an attempt to create autonomous economic \nentities, and to provide incentives for managers to establish new business links with buyers \nand suppliers as part of the restructuring.  \n Most of the Central and East European countries transformed large numbers of state \nfirms into semi-autonomous corporations. The new corporatised form of state companies was \nexpected to stimulate firms to establish independent business functions, previously co-\nordinated by the Central Plan. Firms had to develop proper procurement and marketing \nfunctions, and this forced them to incur new transaction costs, previously absorbed by the \nstate administrative bodies. The massive indebtedness between firms in Central and Eastern \nEurope could also be attributed to the previous lack of these business functions within state \nenterprises, along with the lack of adequate cost-accounting system. From being disigned, \nprotected, and developed by Governments and bureaucrats under the central planning system, \nenterprises became overnight single autonomous units, exposed to the hostile macro-\neconomic environment.  \n The transition reforms overall effectively opened the door for individual interests to \ncontrol the state owned firms, and unleashed the force of special group, professional, \ninstitutional and individual interests. These reforms in principle, served to re-locate power \nfrom government officials to new private intermediary organisations in the form of trade \nagents, that successfully replaced the functions of the Central Plan.  \nThe new corporate governance structure included Boards of Directors and \nManagement Boards. The composition of these bodies in some cases included individuals \nthat provided state firms with access to resources and new markets. However, in the majority \n                                                          \n1 CMEA - Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, facilitating trade between the member countries \n(Bulgaria, CSFR \u2013 Czechoslovak Federal Republic, GDR - German Democratic Republic , Poland, Hungary, the \nformer USSR, Romania, associated members \u2013 Mongolia, Cuba, Vietnam, and observer \u2013 Yugoslavia). \n 4\nof cases, the Boards of Directors were ineffective to facilitate and to lead the strategic \nrestructuring of the firms. \n As a result of the corporatisation, a number of state control mechanisms over the \neconomic activities of firms were lost. The most evident ones were the tax collection and the \nre-distribution of profits. The privatisation programmes in this respect have also failed so far \nto assure the establishment of effective control over the management of the enterprises, or in \nthe majority of cases, to provide access to foreign capital and expertise, and to facilitate \nstructural changes at macro level.  \nAs Frydman and Rapaczynski (1994) point out, all the efforts to decentralise the \neconomic system both before and after the collapse of the communist regimes, have not \nachieved their objectives. The macro-economic conditions, produced by transition policies, \nresemble a hostile and turbulent environment with extremely high inflation, negative \neconomic growth, dramatic decline in demand and purchasing power, disco-ordination \nbetween regulatory bodies, and insufficient market information. \n \nSOURCES OF BUSINESS RISK  \nIN TRANSITION ECONOMIES \n  \nThe intense transition reforms created macroeconomic instability that raised the risk of \nbusiness operations throughout the whole region. The instability of the business environment \nexposed enterprises to multiple risks, such as: market risks, financial risks, and resource \nmanagement risks (Ritchie and Marshal, 1993). The market risks, that firms faced, were \ndetermined mainly by the changes in demand, by the increased variations in consumer tastes \nand confidence, by the decline in individuals\u2019 purchasing power, and by the changes in \ngovernment regulations.  \n The financial risks were determined by the instability of exchange rates (driven by the \nhigh inflation); by the increased taxation; by the level of bad debt, accumulated by individual \nfirms; and by the withdrawal of state subsidies and relieves.  \nThe resource management risks were induced by the unavailability of raw materials, \nqualified labour, and advanced technology.  \n If we look at the Government policies in Central and Eastern Europe from risk-\nmanagement perspective, the liberalisation of trade and prices dramatically increased market \nrisk. The shock therapies during the early transition in Poland and Bulgaria for example, had \na much more dramatic impact on firms, compared with more gradual liberalisation policies in \nthe Czech Republic and Romania. The liberalisation of prices is seen by managers in our \ncases as one of the major factors that led to massive increase of inter-enterprise debt, \naccumulated from non-receivables between buyers and suppliers. The monetarisation of the \neconomy increased the financial problems and difficulties in obtaining credits, and blocked \nthe payments between firms. The disrupted communications and trade relations (particularly \nwith the collapse of the CMEA) led to multiple resource management risks. Suppliers from \nCMEA countries were usually obstructed by difficulties in intergovernmental negotiations of \npayments between member countries.  \n All these risks varied across industries and across countries, and this determined the \ndifferent speed of the decline and recovery of different transition economies. For example, \nthe Czech Republic was able to attract early foreign direct investment and to write-off  the \nbad debts of a large number of state enterprises. This reduced the financial risks of these \nfirms, and as we can see from the sellected case studies, the firms increased their chances for \na successful adjustment to the new market conditions. \n 5\nThis discussion leads to the conclusion that the risk aversive strategies adopted by the \nmajority of firms in Central and Eastern Europe were the most appropriate response, as seen \nfrom the risk management perspective. \n \n STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCIES AND BARRIERS TO \nTRANSITION REFORMS \n  \nFocusing on the enterprise response to transition reforms, it was expected that the \nprivatisation and the liberalisation policies would automatically create an incentive structure \nand establish the pre-conditions for a rational economic behaviour. However, a detailed \nanalysis of the business environment in transition economies suggests that the extreme level \nof uncertainty obstructs strategic decisions, and creates barriers for restructuring. \n The official Government sources of information during the transition period were \ninadequate to provide reliable market information The lack of adequate market information \nputs an extra value on informal personal, professional, and political links and ties established \nby managers from the past. This explains why managers in Central and Eastern Europe \nenhanced their former links based on personal relations. These personal networks were \nemployed in business to establish new contracts with suppliers and buyers, and to re-\nnegotiate managers\u2019 positions and the positions of their enterprises. \n The positions of firms within the value chain, and their control over contracts with \nbuyers and suppliers are discussed both in the strategy literature and the literature on \nnetworks. Although most of the research on network analysis is based on the definition of \nnetworks as the emergent structure from relationships between social entities (Wasserman \nand Faust, 1994), a number of research findings point out to other linkages between firms \nthrough ownership, and representation on Boards of Directors (Burt,  1979, Scott, 1987). \nOur definition of business networks, as the repetitive transactions between firms, \nprovides an additional perspective for the analysis of the dependencies between firms within \ntheir value chains. The dependencies on suppliers and markets exist also in developed market \neconomies. However, the specific industrial structure in Central and Eastern Europe, \ninherited from the period of central planning, illustrates the structural dependencies that firms \nare facing. The concept of structural dependencies is particularly relevant in the context of \nhigh asset specificity and limited access to suppliers. \nMost of the firms in the region were designed with high asset specificity, in order to \nserve a particular range of clients. The development of their business networks was driven by \nthe output target (as fixed by the Central Plan, and required as a major input for another state \nfirm). These material and product dependencies were coupled with locational distortions. \nInvestments in manufacturing capabilities were located by the central planners according to \nsocial objectives for local economic development and for creation of employment in less-\ndeveloped regions. \n One of the barriers to restructuring is that by design, firms were closely tied-up in \nbuyer and supplier asset specificity. With the liberalisation reform and the subsequent \nincrease of macro-economic instability and business risk, firms' strategic responses were \ndriven by their existing linkages. The privatisation itself, unless it involved a foreign partner, \ndid not facilitate enough the operational breaking of the former business networks. \n In our analysis of the published case studies, we review different means used by firms \nto extend their choice of suppliers and buyers, and to increase their control over their value \nchain. Using Porter's framework for analysis of competitive advantage, we look at the way \nfirms evaluate and respond to the power of suppliers and customers, and the way they protect \nthemselves from substitutes and other rival products or services. The cases in our selection \n 6\nillustrate different aspects of the firms\u2019 relationships with buyers and suppliers. There is also \ninformation on diversification strategy, employed by the firms.  \nHowever, the responses to increased business risk are more clearly associated with the \nliterature on market entry and motives for foreign direct investment. Amongst observed \nstrategic responses are: the ingagement of foreign partners to assist in restructuring of the \ninherited business network of the firm, and the use of personal, professional and political \nnetworks in providing valuable market information and new contract opportunities.  \nIn addition to the analysis of the strategic response of firms, we attempt to explain the \nrestructuring of the business networks, looking at the effect of the macro-economic \nenvironment and other barriers, reported by managers in the case studies. \n \nMETHODOLOGY FOR COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS AND \nCLASSIFICATION OF BUSINESS CASES  \n  \nThe case studies used in this paper originate from a number of publications (Estrin, 1995, \nHirschhausen and Hui, 1995, Johnson,  et. al., 1996). The cases of firms from Bulgaria and \nRomania stem from unpublished research reports (Estrin, et.al., 1997), used in this paper with \nthe permission of the authors. These case studies are treated as the main source of \ninformation for our secondary analysis.  \nOur underlying hypothesis is that the adjustment behaviour of firms during the \ntransition is pre-determined by the macro-economic conditions, the position that each firm \noccupies in a particular industry, and its control over the value chain.  \n For analytical purposes seven new categories are developed to allow comparability \nbetween the cases and the companies from different countries. We interpret the effect of \nmacro-economic environment as related to dependencies on government decisions. The \ninformation available on the industrial structure, relevant to each particular case, is \ninterpreted as dependencies on intra-industry, inter-industry, and inter-firm linkages. \nReported personal and professional linkages that affect business decisions are interpreted as \npersonal, professional, and political networks. Information on firms\u2019 structure, organisation \nand capabilities is extracted from the published sources under the categories of intra-firm \ndependencies, and accumulated resources and capabilities \/ access to markets. In addition, \nthe market conditions are described under the category uncertainty of resources. The strategic \nresponse of each particular company is described under the category strategic behaviour, \nadaptation, and repositioning. \n These categories for the secondary analysis of the cases are defined in terms of the \nqualitative and quantitative information provided by the managers in each case, and stem \nfrom our analysis of the business risks and the structural dependencies in the region. The \ncategories facilitate the analysis of the dependencies which each firm experiences in relation \nto its value chain, to its markets, and to Government policies. \nThe dependency of firms on government decision: The proper functioning of the \nmarket is a result of a systematic political process that involves government intervention \nthrough taxation, subsidies and regulations. The effect of government policies on company \nre-orientation during the transition period in Central and Eastern Europe is reported by \nmanagers mainly in reply to questions about barriers and difficulties experienced by the \ncompany.  \n Usually in their account managers refer to the effect of macro-economic policies such \nas: price and trade liberalisation, exchange rate adjustment and convertibility of the home \ncurrency, privatisation law and bankruptcy procedures, administrative and governmental \ndecisions regarding company status and ownership structure, and other detailed aspects of \nthe regulatory framework. In our analysis we look at the barriers to restructuring and \n 7\ndevelopment, imposed on firms by Government regulations and the effect of protectionist \ngovernment policies. \nThe dependency of firms on inter-firm, inter- and intra-industry linkages: The \nsocialist industrial system was built with a high degree of integration of processes and \noperations across different industrial sectors of the economy in order to achieve economies of \nscale. The management control and the strategic skills for the co-ordination of the vertical \nand the horizontal linkages were located in State Industrial Holding Companies and Branch \nMinistries (Kornai, 1992, Chavance, 1992, Todeva, 1997). Therefore, there was a designed \nmarket structure, which influenced intra-industry mobility of resources, directed by the State \nHolding Companies (called Industrial Associations and Combines). There were effectively no \nnew market entryes of new businesses. All input and output markets (determining the value \nchain and the value system of individual enterprises (Porter, 1991)) were pre-designed by the \nadministrative authorities, and facilitated repetitive transactions. Managers usually reported \ninformation relevant to this category when asked about the difficulties with suppliers, \ndifficulties with the distribution of their products, changes of customers, and relationships \nwith administrative organisations and financial institutions.   \nPersonal, Professional and Political Networks: It is an established fact that the \nformer socialist economies were managed by highly hierarchical political and administrative \nstructures, that represented the totalitarian state. After the collapse of the Central Plan, many \nof these relationships were transformed into personal networks and informal groupings of \nindividuals, that continued to work with each other. Usually this information is provided by \nmanagers who describe personal links that are used for their business. These professional and \npolitical networks resemble very much the patronage relations described by Willerton (1992).  \nIntra-firm dependencies: This category refers to the work by Mintzberg (1983) on \nintra- and inter-organisational power relationships and structures for decision making and \ncontrol. This includes the structure of corporate control. Managers reported in the cases the \ndifficulties they face in the areas of: departmental structure, business functions, industrial \nrelations, and the entire internal environment of the company. These characteristics are called \nintra-firm dependencies. They usually are perceived by managers as barriers to organisational \nchange and business restructuring.  \nThe Accumulation of Resources and Capabilities \/ Access to Markets: The \npublished case studies provide information about the size of the firm, production capacity, \nproduct range and differentiation, or any other strengths that give comparative advantage to \nthe company itself. The market access is included in this category as well, because in \nprinciple it secures revenue for the firm. These strategic advantages we have labelled as \naccumulated resources and capabilities. In our analysis we compare how these resources are \nused for strategic restructuring and re-positioning of the firm. \nUncertainty of Resources: This category facilitates the collection of information \nabout barriers, and market threats. Usually managers reported problems they have to solve, \nincluding: changes in their market demand, and the lack of particular resources (due to \nmarket deficiencies). \nStrategic Behaviour: All cases in our selection have addressed the issue of the \nchanges made (or attempted) during the transition period. The reported information includes \nboth intended and implemented changes, or any attempts that the firm has made for \nadaptation, re-orientation, and re-positioning on the market.  \n All these categories are indicative, and they serve mainly the purpose to provide a \ncomparable framework for interpretation of the published cases. Our secondary analysis \nprovides a profile for each company, whith emphasis on firms\u2019 dependencies and responses \nto the business risks. This additional interpretation and review of the published information \n 8\nfacilitates a better understanding of the transition processes that affect the company \nbehaviour. \nOur comparative analysis of the cases identified two main criteria that determine the \ntype of strategic response of the firms: a) structural dependency of the firm; and b) market \ndependency. According to these criteria we devided all cases in the following groups: a) \nbusiness networks based on transformed dependencies, comprising of firms established under \nthe old system of Central Planning, and b) newly established business networks, evolved \nalong new business start-ups, or the appropriation of the business operations by new legal \nentities such as joint ventures, or acquisitions. Each group is divided into two sub-groups \nreferring to national business networks, and international business networks, according to \ntheir main market and access to foreign partner. The grouping of international business \nnetworks includes firms engaged in economic transactions with foreign partners, and refers to \nthe modes of foreign market entry of international firms by Stephen Young (1989). Young\u2019s \ncategories include: a) exporting, b) licensing, c) franchising, d) management contracts, e) \nturnkey contracts (for establishment of a complete production unit or infrastructure project), \nf) international subcontracting (or placing orders with specifications), g) industrial co-\noperation agreements (involving government agencies), h) contractual joint ventures, j) \nequity joint ventures, k) wholly owned subsidiaries. If firms report only repetitive \ntransactions with partners within the home market, their business networks are treated as \nnational.  \n \nTYPOLOGY OF BUSINESS NETWORKS \n \nThe first group of cases (Table 1.) represents firms with long history that have successfully \ntransformed their dependencies within the business network of suppliers, buyers, and other \ncontract agencies. The measure of success here derives from the managerial evaluation of the \nfirm\u2019s performance, and from our evaluation of the strategic responce, as described in each \ncase. The assumption is that the withdrawal of the state and the collapse of the Central Plan, \nhas required firms to replace the mechanisms of allocation of resources. In doing so firms \nhave repositioned themselves within the value chain. Ultimately, non-successful firms are \nthose, that have terminated their work, with frozen assets and operations, or firms that have \nfaced bankruptcy. \n \nTABLE 1: Business Networks Based on Transformed Dependencies \n \nNational Business Networks  \n 1.

The authors of the case argue that the entire process \nhas been driven by the rapid privatisation in the country. The inconsistency of government \npolicies related to privatisation issues, has allowed a highly organised professional network \nof \u2018managers\u2019 within the electronics sector to take control of the majority of assets. The \nmechanism of consolidating the former network has been facilitated by the privatization \nprogram of the Lithuanian Government. \n \nDependency on Government Decisions: \n\u2026 Most Investment Funds were established in 1992 with no regulatory framework on the composition of \nassets or price, and no competition control; Creation of multiple funds by the same people; In 1992, the \nprofessional group of managers in the electronics established the EBSW Investment Fund \u2026  \n \nInter-Industry dependencies: \n\u2026 In 1992 EBSW Investment Fund bought 40% of the shares of TV-2, 30% - of TV-1; in addition \nmanagers acquired directly another 25%  of TV-2 shares and 30% of TV-1 shares; 5% of the Investment \nFunds in Lithuania hold 52% of the invested vouchers in the electronic sector; each investment fund \ncontrols a commercial bank, one or more insurance companies, a distribution network and trade firms; in \nthis way, an investment fund with the smallest possible amount of capital have become the majority owner \nof a large network of enterprises\u2026 \n \n The case does not provide sufficient information whether this transformation of \nownership has led to changes in efficiency, or even in profitability. However, it demonstrates \nhow the main group of the largest two manufacturers in the electronics sector, and seven of \ntheir major suppliers, have formed a Holding company as an extended business network, \ncomprising of an investment fund, a commercial bank, at least one insurance company, a \ndistribution network, and a number of trade firms.  \n This case demonstrates that the restructuring of the electronics industry in Lithuania is \nnot a market led transformation. A professional network of individuals have transformed the \nentire sector of the electronics industry, re-enforcing previously existing inter-industry \nlinkages and dependencies on suppliers and markets. They have used the dependencies on \ncentralised Government subsidies and the regulatory reforms in Lithuania as a vehicle for \nachieving their private aims. \nIt is also evident from the case, that the new business formation is lobbying the \nGovernment to conclude new commercial agreements with the CIS countries, in order to \nfacilitate access to the Russian markets for the private holding company. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n2 Hirschhausen, C. & Hui, W. (1995) Industrial Restructuring in the Baltic Countries: Large-scale Privatisation, New \nEnterprise Networks and Growing Diversity of Corporate Governance, In: Communist Economies & Economic \nTransformation, Vol. 7, No. 4, pp. 421-443. \n \n 10\nHUNGARY - Hungartextile Holding \/ Textile \/ Cloth3 \nThe second example in the group of transformed national networks is Hungartextile \nHolding, which controls 30% of the total output of the Hungarian textile \/ cloth industry. \n \nDependency on Government Decisions: \n\u2026 The 1988 Act on Economic Associations transformed the former Economic Associations into Holdings \nwith independent subsidiaries; The intention of creating the Holdings was to create an assets management \nstructure, which will perform many administrative functions including some from the subsidiaries \u2026 \n \nIntra-Firm Dependencies: \n\u2026 It was established as a Holding in June 1989; In 1991 the subsidiaries became loss-makers themselves;  \nFrom March 1992, it was supervised by the Government through State Property Agency; The Holding lost \nall of its production, but kept part of its predecessor\u2019s purchasing and sales functions; Cross-ownership \nbetween subsidiaries, while the Holding controls between 80-98% of the shares in each subsidiary\u2026 \n \nThis case shows in contrast with the Lithuanian Electronics, that the actual ambitions \nof the managers are not to run the holding company, but to use it as a legal entity that bears \nthe liabilities of the loss making firms. The expectations are that these loss-making firms will \nbe closed by the Government to clear the bad debts.  \n The devolution of administrative control in Hungary has changed the ownership status \nof the members of the Hungartextile Holding. However, the case does not suggest  a major \nchange in the suppliers and buyers networks of the main firm. The change of ownership and \nthe formation of the Holding company has not led to a diversification of products, or to \naccess to new markets. On the contrary, the case shows that in spite of the significant changes \nin the structure of ownership and control, the loss of CMEA markets (43% of their output in \n1991) has made all of the subsidiaries of the Holding into loss making firms.  \n The high level of technology (60-70% up to western standard) has created over-\ncapacity which poses additional questions for a rationalisation of the business. The changes in \nownership have not altered the dependency of the firm both on the Government decisions, \nand on the structure of the textile \/ cloth industry, and the intra-firm linkages between \nsubsidiaries. This case is also an example of the fact that the interests linked to the \nprivatisation are focused on the high value-added business functions. \n Both cases of the Lithuanian Industrial Holding in Electronics and the Hungarian \nHungartextile Holding demonstrate \u2018successful\u2019 change of ownership from an economic \nperspective. However, the brief review of these cases highlights the barriers to their re-\npositioning on the international market. \n There are a number of published cases of firms that were able to internationalise their \nactivity. This type of transformed business networks is presented in the separate sub-group of \ninternational business networks.  \n \nLATVIA \u2013 PAF Minibus Assembling4 \n  \nAn interesting case of internationalisation of the business network through shared \ncross-border ownership is the Latvian company PAF, operating in the sector of minibus \nassembling. From the original case it is evident that the Latvian company in the past has been \n                                                          \n3 Estrin, S., et al. (Eds.) (1995) Restructuring and Privatisation in Central Eastern Europe: Case Studies of Firms in \nTransition, M. E. Sharp, Inc., New York. \n \n4 Hirschhausen, C. & Hui, W. (1995) Industrial Restructuring in the Baltic Countries: Large-scale Privatisation, New \nEnterprise Networks and Growing Diversity of Corporate Governance, In: Communist Economies & Economic \nTransformation, Vol. 7, No. 4, pp. 421-443. \n \n 11\nheavily dependent on Russian suppliers and the Russian market. This has forced the company \nmanagement and the Latvian Government to initiate in 1995 a cross-ownership deal with the \nRussian company GAZ \u2013 their strategic supplier.  \n \nDependency on Government Decisions: \n\u2026 78% of privatisations in Latvia have been carried out through long-term lease \u2026 \n \nInter-Industry Dependency: \n\u2026 The company PAF is a centre of a large network of 10 major and 100 minor suppliers of materials and \ncomponents; 10% of the suppliers are from Latvia, and 80% - from the FSU, and the most strategic one is \nGAZ; At least three of its major Russian suppliers decided to start minibus production themselves (GAZ, \nBratsk, Uliyanov) \u2026 \n \nAccumulated Resources and Capabilities \/ Access to Markets: \n\u2026 The company was a supplier of minibuses to the entire SU; until 1992 - the only producer in FSU of 12-\nseat passenger and ambulance vans; 93% of its  production distributed in the FSU\u2026 \n \nThe internationalisation of ownership, and the re-enforcement of the former \ndependencies, within the production chain has helped the company to maintain its position on \nthe Russian market. The case shows that the main factor that drives the successful transition \nof the firm is its access to markets, rather than the change of ownership. The change of \nownership in this case is motivated by the attempt to tie-up GAZ who is the main supplier of \nparts and a potential competitor. This is a defensive strategy by PAF, which has high \nspecificity of its assets, and aims to protect its position in a business network that is located in \nRussia. \n \nCZECH REPUBLIC - PSP - Heavy Engineering \/ Iron Processing Machinery5 \n  \nThe Czech company PSP Heavy Engineering is a very good example of how an \ninfluential management team in this sector, and an appropriately selected Board of Directors \nand Supervisory Board, have succeeded in lobbying the Czech Government for a number of \nfavourable decisions. This is an example of Young\u2019s type of international market entry \nthrough industrial cross-border co-operation involving the governments of The Czech \nRepublic and Ukraine.  \n \nDependency on Government Decisions: \n\u2026 In the past the company was supported by Government orders through a state foreign trade firm, which \nsubcontracted work for a large multi-governmental investment project in Ukraine and Russia through an \nInvestment Engineering Group; The state provided long-term, low-interest, government guaranteed bank \nloans; The state foreign trade firm used to bare all risks; In 1988, the Investment Engineering Group split \ninto several parts, and The Principal Contractor unit became a division in PSP; In 1993 the outgoing \nCzechoslovak Government agreed to stop its investment  in Ukraine, to pay the loan collateral and the \ninterest payments in yearly instalments for 10 years and to pay PSP lost profits; The Government \ntransferred ownership of the assets to all major suppliers to the project and one potential buyer of the \nproducts from the Ukrainian venture (all newly privatised) \u2026 \n \nAccumulated Resources \/ Access to Markets: \n\u2026 Most overdue receivables were recovered and the irretrievable ones were sold; The company used the \nunclear relationships on the multi-governmental investment project in Ukraine as a secure market, utilising \nthe cheaper loan and completing its part of the investment; Produces technological equipment for coal \npower stations, cement and ceramic industries; Its main clients at present are privatised construction \ncompanies; The firm plans to grow in a niche market of environmental technology... \n                                                          \n5 Estrin, S., et al. (Eds.) (1995) Restructuring and Privatisation in Central Eastern Europe: Case Studies of Firms in \nTransition, M. E. Sharp, Inc., New York. \n 12\n \n The case shows that the firm has survived through \u2018extracting\u2019 financial resources \nfrom the Czech Government in a variety of ways, rather than through re-positioning itself on \nthe market. This includes the clearance of the bad debts of the firm. \nThis case shows how through its political network, the company has turned its \ndependency on the Ukrainian market, and the inter-government negotiations of cross-\nownership into an advantage, by sheltering itself from the shocks of inflation and the \nunfavourable exchange rates. \n \nCZECH REPUBLIC - Spolana \/ Chemicals6 \n  \nAnother Czech company in the heavy chemicals industry Spolana demonstrates the \npoint that without a major transformation of ownership, or changes in its relationship with \nsuppliers, the company has survived through increased exports to western markets, and \nthrough the internationalisation of its business network.  \n \nDependency on Government Decisions: \n\u2026Cancellation of debt in 1991 by the Government; Dependent on cheap crude oil from Russia and a range \nof imports \u2026 \n \nAccumulation of Resources and Capabilities\/ Access to Markets: \n\u2026 Size-10,000; 17% reduction of the labour force; Highly diversified production in industrial chemistry, \nman-made fibres, plastics, agrochemistry, gastrochemistry, synthetic hormones for the medicine \u2026 \n \nStrategic Response: \n\u2026Significant proportion of their products are made under the license of foreign firms; R&D co-\noperation with University for Chemical Technology in Prague; 55% of exports are to Germany & Benelux \ncountries; The loss of domestic markets was compensated by rapid growth in exports; Obtained credits \nwere secured by immovable assets exceeding 1.3 times the credit \u2026 \n \nThe main form of internationalisation for Spolana is licensing and exporting. \nHowever, the successful restructuring of the firm was supported by the government \ncancellation of firm\u2019s debt in 1991, which enabled it to obtain fresh credits.  \n \nROMANIA - Clujana Trading Co. \/ Leather & Leather Substitute Shoes7 \n  \nThe Romanian company Clujana in the footwear industry is an example of a firm that \nhas expanded its national business network and simultaneously has increased its international \npresence through exports. Within its national business network, it has linked itself with two \nnew ownership funds - the State Property Fund, and the Private Property Fund called IV \nMuntenia. This has enabled it to secure financial resources from both of them. It could be \nargued that the major change for the company is the shift of control - from ministerial control \nto control by the two ownership funds, who also facilitate its access to foreign markets.  \n \nInter-Industry Dependency: \n\u2026High degree of production integration - the company has the capacity to ensure all necessary \nsemiproducts for its own use and for other shoe producers\u2026 \n \n                                                          \n6 Estrin, S., et al. (Eds.) (1995) Restructuring and Privatisation in Central Eastern Europe: Case Studies of Firms in \nTransition, M. E. Sharp, Inc., New York. \n7 Estrin, S., et al. (Eds.) (1997) [Case Study Reports in Bulgaria and Romania], ACE-PHARE Research Project No. 91-\n0381-R. \n \n 13\nStrategic Behaviour: \n\u2026Decrease of production for sales on domestic market from 63.7% (in 1991) to 50.5% (in 1994) and a \nforecast of 33% (by 1998); Increased production for foreign markets from 36% (in 1991) to 49.5% (in \n1994) and was forecasted 67% (by 1998); Planning re-technologisation of the factories with the support \nfrom the State Ownership Fund \u2026 \n \nThis is an example of a successful linkage between the production firm Clujana with \nfinancial institutions which also manage its exporting activities and the overall \ninternationalisation.  \n \nCZECH REPUBLIC - Motorpal \/ Auto Parts, Fuel Injection8 \n  \nThe Czech company Motorpal operates in the automotive industry, producing auto \nparts and fuel injection. In comparison with the other cases, they are one of the largest firms \nand one of the most experienced in conducting international business operations. However, \ntheir survival has been determined not so much by the managerial competencies in \nrestructuring and adjustment, but by their almost monopolistic position in the sector, their \ntechnical expertise and know-how, their intensive capitalisation by the former socialist \ngovernments, and their business ties with the car manufacturer Skoda, through which they \nhave gained access to new business partners in Germany.  \n In spite of the fact that the managers do not report specific business linkages, it is \nevident that in addition to the reputation of a former CMEA market leader, the company has \nbenefited from subcontracting to Skoda\u2019s acquirers, Volkswagen. It is clear in this case that \nthe main revenue of the company at present comes from their exporting and subcontracting \nactivities. The case describes well different attempts for restructuring. \n \nUncertainty of Resources: \n\u2026The collapse of CMEA market and the decline in the domestic market led to 60% cut in orders; Delayed \npayments by clients caused secondary indebtedness and shortage of cash\u2026 \n \nDependency on Government Decisions: \n\u2026In 1990 became a joint stock company; The two major changes that affected trade were 1990 currency \ndevaluation through changes in exchange rates and 1991 price liberalisation; As part of the macro-\neconomic stabilisation wages were frozen for the first half of 1991 and remained regulated until the end of \n1992, which led to social unrest in the firm; The government cancelled part of the debts of the firm and the \ndebt of many of its suppliers and customers, but the banks applied this credit to the interest, not to the loans \nof the firms \u2026 \n \nAccumulated Resources: \n\u2026The company comprises of seven plants in six towns - 3,800 employees\u2026 \n \nIntra-Industry Dependency: \n\u2026Active participation of fuel injection producers in R&D with engine producers \u2026 \n \nStrategic Behaviour: \n\u2026 In 1991-92 two new products were produced for the West European market, which is a proof of good \ntechnical skills; Exploring new markets in Middle East, North Africa, India, Indonesia & China \u2026 \n \n                                                          \n8 Estrin, S., et al.

Sharp, Inc., New York. \n \n 14\n Under the category of newly established business networks (Table 2.) we have \ngrouped firms  that have appeared on the market as new business start-ups, or new legal \nentities, that do not bare directly the liabilities of former state enterprises.  \n \nTABLE 2: New Established Business Networks \n \nNational Business Networks  \n 1.

BULGARIA - P-05 \/ Textile \/ Cloth \n \nCZECH REPUBLIC - Tipa \/ Footwear Industry9 \n  \nOf interest is the Czech company working in the footwear industry, named Tipa. It is \nunclear why the company has been classified by its managers as operating in the footwear \nsector as it is actually involved in businesses in ten different industrial sectors, including \nagricultural production, travel services, construction (also export of labour in construction), \nagricultural machinery sales, foreign trade, shoe production, frozen food and ice-cream \nproduction and sale, a bakery for bread production, general retail and wholesale, a real estate \nagency services, and telecommunication and security services. As some of the facilities were \nacquired from former state firms, the link with the Government has been strong. \n \nDependency on Government Decisions: \n\u2026A general lack of money in the economy meant that other resources were blocked as accounts receivable \nafter their maturity; To offset the burden of taxes the firm received subsidies in 1991\u2026 \n \nPersonal, Professional and Political Networks: \n\u2026The group of the nine founders of the business are former executives from nearby state and co-operative \nfarms in the area of Trade, Travel, Information, Production, and Agriculture, and they knew each other for \nmany years from the High School \u2026 \n \nAccumulation of Resources and Capabilities \/ Access to Market: \n\u2026Size - 600 employees in 10 industrial sectors; Accumulation of different technologies & contacts which \nallowed diversification; Rely on their own information of the market opportunities and the available skills; \nMaintain a rich network of contacts and connections which facilitates business operations such as: finding \nsources of inputs, leasing offices and work spaces, and identifying high profit market niches and take-over \nopportunities\u2026 \n \nStrategic Behaviour: \n\u2026It is constructing a plant for wood processing with second hand machinery from a bankrupt Swiss co-\noperative; All investments have been made using loans or leasing service; Planning joint ventures with \nGerman and Italian partners and a joint venture with a Russian partner to facilitate barter deals; Exporting \nlabour to Germany; Planning to expand into a milk processing plant, an acquisition of a packaging plant \nand establishment of a regional savings bank; Planning to expand in Slovakia by acquiring some \n                                                          \n9 Estrin, S., et al.

Sharp, Inc., New York.  \n \n 15\nbusinesses in a particular town - looking for businesses with high profit margin; Registered two investment \nfunds for the privatisation and trained the managers of the funds; Operating within regional boundaries \u2026 \n \n It has started as a small business start-up in the retail sector with a regional focus of \noperations. The company has grown rapidly through an intense diversification, and has \nachieved high profit margins in all activities as identified by their well informed managerial \nteam. At the centre of this business network stands a group of nine former executives from \nlocal state and co-operative farms who have known each other for many years. It seems that \nthe business has grown around the personal ties that each individual has maintained from the \npast. \n \nHUNGARY - Elegant Charm \/ Textile \/ Garments10 \n  \nVery similar in this respect is the case from the Hungarian textile industry Elegant \nCharm Ltd. It is a spin-off of a major industrial group of ten plants, which has managed to \nsurvive through a co-operative agreement with Levi Strauss. This is an example of a business \nnetwork that demonstrates both the efforts of Central and East European firms to access \nwestern markets, and the interests of the western partners to expand eastwards in this highly \nlabour intensive industrial sector.  \n \nIntra-Firm Dependencies: \n\u2026The company was established in 1990 as a spin-off from the main Group of ten plants; Some of these \nplants had obsolete technology and become financially a drain on the firm; Initially the largest shareholder \nwas the main group - with 48,9% share, equivalent to the machinery and equipment arbitrarily overpriced; \nThe second shareholder was OTP Bank with 25.5% and three smaller private firms (a small trading house, \nan agricultural co-operative & a small private firm) with 25.6% combined; Later on, the equity stakes of \nthe three smaller firms were sold to a single private firm; The present Director General has been the former \nhead of trade & co-operation department at the old Group, who initially disagreed of splitting the Group; \nLack of marketing department and as a result of that the company is loosing 4-5% added to the final sale \nprice dealing through trading houses\u2026 \n \nIntra-Industry Dependency: \n\u2026There is a large number of firms on the domestic market which compete with imports rather than between \nthemselves; The intensity of competition is caused by the narrow specialisation of producers and their \ndirect access to the retail market, therefore the retail firms design their network of suppliers \u2026 \n \nUncertainty of Resources: \n\u2026The company is under-capitalised due to its small collateral, necessary for credits; The domestic market \nfor finished products had shrunk due to fall in household consumption; The Group utilised only small part \nof the capacity of the company and this created need to find new markets outside the orbit of the Group; \nUncertainty of ownership \u2013 some of the small share holders were liquidated, others sold their shares and \nthe Group was also in liquidation \u2026 \n \nStrategic Behaviour: \n\u2026The firm has a co-operation agreement with Levi Strauss for jeans; There is a signed agreement between \nthe two firms that the company can not enter into business relations with a Group\u2019s partners for 5 years; \nProduces leather clothing, which is capital intensive and takes a lot of firm\u2019s profit for re-financing routine \nshort term credits; A deep gap between production & marketing capabilities & lack of co-ordination \nbetween the two; Aggressive subcontracting to utilise up to 108% of the capacity; Gradually creating an \nindependent design department, which made of up to 15% of the sales; Gradually closing down several \nloss-making product lines, such as leather clothing and fur products; These capacities were converted to \ntextile-sewing; The management would like to acquire the shares owned by the Group after the Group\u2019s \nliquidation - at a price of 75% of their value, offering to take 50% of them and the other 50% to offer to the \n                                                          \n10 Estrin, S., et al.

Sharp, Inc., New York. \n 16\nworkers; The management also has started negotiations to acquire the shares from OTP Bank; Planning a \ntake-over one of the plants of the Group, or to purchase the facilities rented rat present\u2026 \n \nThe internationalisation of the company is achieved through the contractual joint \nventure with Levi Strauss and through exporting (as much as 60% of its output is exported). \nHowever, the company itself has no marketing or sales department, and this demonstrates its \ndependency not only on the international partner, but also on the trading houses that operate \nas intermediaries in its business dealings.  \n \nHUNGARY - Interchokolade KFT \/ Food Processing \/ Chocolate11 \n  \nThe Hungarian company Interchokolade KFT in the food processing industry has been \ngradually acquired by a Swiss multinational company \u2018Globalfood\u2019. This acquisition \nobviously brings international expertise and market opportunities for one of the four largest \nHungarian manufacturers in this sector. However, in this case it is suggested that by joining \nthe international network of Globalfood subsidiaries, the company has lost autonomy, and has \nbecome a dependent division which provides manufacturing facilities and access to the \nHungarian market for the Swiss multinational firm.  \n \nDependency on Government Decisions: \n\u2026Nationalised in 1947, integrated into an industrial trust in 1963 & decentralised in 1981 when it was \nforced to merge with a sugar factory until 1985; This led to depletion of company\u2019s reserves due to world \ncrisis and depressed prices for the sugar industry; Taxes on profits were not paid in 1991 due to extremely \nhigh taxes on wages introduced with the new income tax system in 1988; Received export subsidies until \n1990 and the company experienced a significant decline in export performance after; The Swiss partner \n\u2018Globalfood\u2019, became an almost exclusive owner in 1992\u2026 \n \nIntra-Industry Dependency: \n\u2026The Hungarian confectionery industry was highly competitive since 1987 with 4 state enterprises, 37 \nbakery firms owned by municipalities, and 30 co-operatives; By 1991 the industry was dominated by three \nfirms which were ranked 19, 32 & 98 on the Hungarian industry list of the top 200 firms; Exogenous \nfactors have quite a strong impact, because price fluctuations on the sugar market are large and this affects \nprofits\u2026 \n \nUncertainty of Resources: \n\u2026Total increase of costs between 1988-91 - 77%, including 138% wage costs, 142% fixed costs, 43%-\nmaterials & 62%-energy; Rapid increase of wages without significant lay offs; 10 times increase of bank \ndebt (1988-91) due to higher interest rates, inflation and delayed payments; Irredeemability of most \nreceivables which doubled between 1990-91 and increased more than 10 times after 1988; The firm lost \ncompletely its autonomy and was integrated into the world confectionery industry in exchange of its access \nto the Hungarian domestic market for chocolate products\u2026 \n \nIn spite of the privatisation of KFT by a Multinational company, the main advantages \nfor the Hungarian firm seem to be the maintained core labour force, and the stable financial \nsituation of the firm. \n \nSLOVAK REPUBLIC - CS-07 \/ Food processing \/ Chocolates & Sweets12 \n  \nThe Slovak company \u2018CS-07\u2019has agreed an equity joint venture with Jacobs-Suchard, \nafter 27% of the labour force was sacked. Of note here is that the interest of the foreign \n                                                          \n11 Estrin, S., et al. (Eds.)

Sharp, Inc., New York. \n 17\ncompany was instigated primarily by the presence of their international competitors (Nestle \nand BSN\/France) in the Czech Republic.  \n \nDependency on Government Decisions: \n\u2026The legal system provides weak penalties for not fulfilling a contract; The Ministry of Agriculture and \nGrocery had no power to manage the firm with exception of appointing the General Director and \nevaluating the economic results annually; In 1992 the firm became a Joint-Stock Co.,  administered by the \nFund of National Property who appoints the Board of Directors (a General Director and four Vice-\nDirectors) and the Supervisory Board (with one representative from The Fund and two from the firm)\u2026 \n \nIntra-Industry Dependency: \n\u2026In the past 80% of production was purchased by wholesale organisations; Their collapse led to increase \nof inventories; The firm now access the market only through small businesses\u2026 \n \nUncertainty of Resources: \n\u2026Above 70% of exports were to CMEA markets; The collapse of the system for integrative sales in 1990 \nled to discoordination of production and sales (in a situation when demand exceeds the supply) and the \nneed for planning by the firm \u2026 \n \nStrategic Behaviour: \n\u2026It has agreed a sale of 32% of the shares to the Swiss firm (Jacobs-Suchard), which is to increase to 66% \nthrough future investment; At present it subcontracts to a German company against delivery of technology \n& ingredients; Obsolete products and packaging were replaced by purchase of packaging materials from \nAustria, Germany & Italy; Most recent strategies include diversification of production and discontinuity of \nsome product lines; Planned full merger with Jacobs-Suchard, build-up of new distribution channels \nthrough new domestic and foreign partners, acquisition of technology, and expansion into the former \nCMEA markets\u2026 \n \nThis shows that the expansion of international business networks in Central and Eastern \nEurope should be considered more as driven by the wider global competitive environment, \nrather than by competitive advantages within the region, such as new business opportunities \nthat derive from the regulatory reforms in each country, or enterprise competitiveness. \n \nPOLAND - Szczecin Shipyard \/ Shipbuilding13 \n  \nAn exemplary case of internationalisation of an old business network is the shipyard \nin Szczecin. It has emerged from a deeper crises than its neighbour the shipyard in Gdansk, \nand had outplayed it. This is due to a number of factors, including: the aggressive marketing \nstrategy, adopted by its Chief Executive, addressing a world niche market in medium size \ncontainers; the internal re-organisation of the production line; the introduced new \nremuneration system; and the shedding of non-productive assets.  \n \nDependency on Government Decisions: \n\u2026The new managing director secured co-operation of the Polish Development Bank (PDB), a Government \nbank designed to assist in large scale enterprise restructuring; The firm was administered in the past by \nIndustrial Shipbuilding Union, directly accountable to the Ministry of Industry; Governments used to locate \nclients & negotiate with customers through the state trade company \u2018Centromor\u2019 - for a 2% commission of \na ship\u2019s selling prise; The Government provided all finance for a new ship construction, which included \nsubsidies for unprofitable projects (often up to 50% of the total construction cost)\u2026 \nIntra-Firm Dependency: \n                                                          \n13 Johnson, S. et.al. (1996) Complementarities and the Managerial Challenges of State  Enterprise Restructuring: Evidence \nfrom Two Shipyards, In: Economics of Transition, Vol. 4, No. 1, pp. 31-42. (Only the two cases in Shipbuilding industry in \nPoland) \n 18\n\u2026In 1991 the yard and the Polish Development Bank created a joint venture \u2018Container Ship\u2019 with 50% \nownership each; The PDB operated as a guarantee for fleet owners\u2019 prepayments and to provide working \ncapital\u2026 \n \nAccumulation of Resources and Capabilities \/ Access to Markets: \n\u2026Major customers in the past were Eastern Bloc countries, particularly FSU; The trading company paid \nthe yard in domestic currency upon completion of a project; In 1988 signed a contract for four container \nships for German ship owners and the first one being delivered in 1991; In 1992 signed contracts with \nGerman fleet owners for another 13 container ships worth $300 mln; Total contracted ships for 1992 were \n48, or 40% of the international market for medium size containers\u2026 \n \nStrategic Behaviour: \n\u2026By 1991 had $150 mln debt because of expensive bank loans and Soviet insolvency; It was \nforced to delay payments to over 1500 suppliers and a number of commercial banks; Created a new \nmarketing office in 1989 to pursue clients and to identify a niche world market; Reduced labour force from \na peak of 13,000 (in 1970s) to 6,000 (in 1991); In 1992 the production value was $182 mln and required \n5,000 workers; Aimed to narrow its product focus and to develop a niche market \u2013 for container ships \nparticularly in medium class; Closed two out of six slipways and a number of other departments comprising \n1500 workers which were transferred to the main production line; Reduced product cycle time for a single \nship from 2-4 years to 11 months; Changed remuneration from paid in piece rate per task to hourly wages \nadjusted by qualification category; Reversed the compensation hierarchy and put highly qualified workers \non top; No overtime work was permitted; The new average salary was two times the national average; \nEliminated many of the employee amenities; Developed competitive advantage by focusing the production; \nIncreased productivity by reducing the production cycle, by the implementation of performance enhancing \ncompensation scheme, by the shedding of non-productive assets, and by the reduction of the number of \nemployees directly involved in ship assembly\u2026 \n \nIt also could be argued that the success of Szczecin shipyard, at the time of the case \nstudy, is due not only to the strategic restructuring efforts of its management team, but also to \nthe business relationships it has established with the Polish Development Bank, and the new \njoint venture between the two partners with a stake of 50% equity each. In fact, this new \naccess to financial resources we consider as growth of the business network of the old \nshipyard, which reduces the dependency of the firm on externally secured bank loans.  \n However, the most important elements of the business network are the contracts with \nGerman ship owners, that provide the firm with an access to important new customers and \nsecure revenue. The numerous contracts with the German ship owners, that the firm has \nacquired, could also be attributed to the former personal and professional contacts and \nbusiness links, as well as the expertise in negotiations of their Chief Executive. This case is \nan example of a successful transformation of the firm\u2019s business network both nationally, \nthrough an equity joint venture with a financial institution as a new legal entity, and \ninternationally, through subcontracting in a niche market. \n \nESTONIA - Tarmenco \/ Furniture Industry14 \n  \nThe case of the Estonian firm Tarmenco in the furniture industry, is also an example \nof a successful internationalisation, switching from the former Russian and CMEA markets to \nthe western markets. The export activities are organised through joining international \ndistribution and sales networks.  \n \n \n \n                                                          \n14 Hirschhausen, C. & Hui, W. (1995) Industrial Restructuring in the Baltic Countries: Large-scale Privatisation, New \nEnterprise Networks and Growing Diversity of Corporate Governance, In: Communist Economies & Economic \nTransformation, Vol. 7, No. 4, pp. 421-443. \n 19\nIntra-Industry Dependency: \n\u2026The privatization led to almost instantaneous reorganisation of production structures and networks in \nindustries close to final demand and less capital intensive like the furniture industry; Upstream, the supply \nof wood and other inputs from Soviet sources was largely cut off and had to be replaced with payments for \nsupplies in hard currency; Downstream, the entire distribution system collapsed\u2026 \n \nAccumulation of Resources and Capabilities \/ Market Access: \n\u2026In 1991, 96% of the production was for FSU, while in 1993 88% of the products were sold in western \ncountries \u2026 \n \nStrategic Behaviour: \n\u2026The survival strategy includes: to diversify production (from 5 - to 150), to develop new \nproducts, and to hook up to existing distribution and sales networks in the west; in 1994 six directors of the \nenterprise took over two-thirds of the property\u2026 \n \nBULGARIA - P-05 \/ Textile \/ Cloth15 \n  \nThe Bulgarian company P-05 also has developed a network of new customers, but \nmainly national trading companies, that manage on their behalf the export of 80% of the \nentire production, and 20% of the imported inputs of the company. \n \nDependency on Government Decisions: \n\u2026In 1991 the enterprise was transformed into a public limited company under the supervision of the \nMinistry of Industry; A main burden is the rise in energy prices and the decline in domestic demand, rather \nthan the competition from imports; The devaluation of the currency had a positive effect on the firm \u2026 \n \nAccumulation of Resources and Capabilities \/ Access to Markets: \n\u2026Compared to 1990, the volume  of production in the sector decreased by 46% in 1993; The firm holds \n40% of the national woollen yarn market and 25% of the worsted cloth market; A presence of a lot of new \ncontractors since the start of the reform; Size in 1994 - 2,000 employees; The volume of production is \ngrowing and in 1994 the demand exceeded the supply \u2026 \n \nStrategic Behaviour: \n\u2026The company has access to new international markets and new resources and bigger \nindependence in setting prices; It has diversified production as a result of its own design projects; It has \ncreated a network of customers which provides opportunities for exports of 80% of its production; \nInvestment in new technology is not a priority for the managers and the firm could maintain its market \nposition on the basis of present equipment and by putting in operation non-utilised reserves \u2026 \n \n In principle, some of the companies in this group represent more transformed business \nnetworks, rather than newly established ones. However, we have placed these cases in this \ngroup to assert the argument that in the cases of successfully restructured companies, there is \na clear brake in the structural linkages within their value chain. P-05 and Tarmenco have \nchanged radically their suppliers and buyers, and operate now in completely new markets. \nSzczecin Shipyard and CS-07 have entered a joint venture which allows them not only access \nto new resources, but also change of buyers and markets. \n The acquisition of Interchokolade has changed its legal identity and its business \noperations, while Tipa and Elegant Charm are examples of the entrepreneurial skills of \nformer managers, who have pulled out assets from former state firms and have started new \nventures. \n \n \n                                                          \n15 Estrin, S., et al.

The dominant assumption \nis the \u2018inadequacy\u2019 of managers to respond to the \u2018new\u2019 market signals delivered through \nmacro-economic policies. The \u2018irrational\u2019 economic behaviour of the managers is usually \nattributed to limited knowledge, experience, and the so caled \u2018post-communist\u2019 culture. In \nthis way it overlooks the role of structural factors in the business environment. \n The research on Central and Eastern Europe identifies a list of contradictory \nobjectives that companies had to pursue in relation to enterprise restructuring: 1) Managers \nhad to develop new business functions (particularly marketing and sales) and therefore \nbringing in new staff, while simultaneously they had to reduce the labour force; 2) Managers \nhad to reduce costs, while at the same time they had to diversify into new products and \nmarkets, requiring additional investments; 3) They had to increase internal financial \naccountability within the firm under a dramatic decline in available working capital, which \nforced them to use alternative and \u2018risky\u2019 methods of payment; 4) They also had to reduce the \nlabour force, while some of the methods for mass privatisation suggested a strong interest of \nkeeping it intact. If we add to this picture the time and resource constraints that managers \nfrom the region experienced, one could understand why managerial decisions were not \nalways adequate to the complexity of the situation. The dependency on past experience and \nnetworks was also reinforced by the need to secure scarce and expensive resources, and to \nengage in some contracts that would ensure the survival of the firm. \n The cases included in this analysis aim to demonstrate the wide variety of business \nnetworks and co-operative relations that have evolved during the transition period in Central \nand Eastern Europe. Some of the cases show that firms have consolidated former \ndependencies, designed by the central planning system. However, the variety of responses by \nfirms indicated the ability of the managers to find new niche markets for survival, and new \nopportunities for internationalisation. \n The firms included in our analysis show that, inspite of the general similarities at \nindustry level, Central and East European companies are not homogeneous by history and \ncurrent business strategy. The differences in transformation of structural linkages, formerly \nestablished by the Central Plan, is seen as being driven mainly by external to the enterprise \nforces. These external factors derive from the instability of the business environment in the \nregion, from the collapse of the CMEA market and the depression of the home market in each \ncountry, and from the structural dependencies within the economy due to mis-allocation of \nresources by the Central Plan. \n The result of the restructuring strategies produces two groups of behaviour -\ntransformed business networks, and newly established networks. The companies that have \ntransformed their former dependencies into manageable business networks show their ability \nto control the external environment primarily through lobbying governments (PSP Heavy \nEngineering), and through influencing the regulatory framework for privatization (Lithuanian \nIndustrial Holding in Electronics).  \n For most of the companies in this group, the transition policies have not affected their \ndominant position in their industries, in spite of the collapse of the market demand (Spolana, \nMotorpal). Their strategic response overall has been to consolidate further their position in \nthe value system (PAF, Hungartextile Holding). The former industrial linkages of the firms, \nand the personal and professional relationships maintained by their Chief Executives, have \ndetermined both the positive and the negative outcomes of their adjustment.  \n The companies with established new business networks demonstrate examples of \nblurred firms\u2019 boundaries (Tipa), of increased dependency on the national and foreign trade \n 21\nfirms, or on international partners in joint ventures and acquisitions (Tarmenco, P-05), and in \nsubcontracting to foreign firms (Interchocolade, CS-07, Elegant Charm). \n The lack of a marketing function by the former socialist enterprises has been one of \nthe most evident reasons for the managers\u2019 failure to adapt to the drop in demand. Most of the \ncases show that an access to new markets facilitates company restructuring. This suggests \nthat the discussions on value chains and the extent to which companies control the elements \nof the entire value system are critical and important in explaining many of the difficulties in \nenterprise restructuring experienced in Central and Eastern Europe. \nFurther analysis is required to establish a more detailed classification of the co-\noperative business networks that have evolved in Central and Eastern Europe during the \ntransition period. Additional analysis could also reveal new patterns of adaptive company \nbehaviour, and their variations across industries, regions and countries. \n \nREFERENCES \n \nBurt, R.
