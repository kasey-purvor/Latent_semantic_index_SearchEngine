Having discounted any solar activity\neffects on the measurement of SCA this paper describes, for the first time, the basic characteristics of\nSCA measured over half a solar cycle.\nIt is revealed that the measurement of SCA is not affected by Solar activity, the local time of\noccurrence of the SSC or the direction of Bz immediately before or after the SSC event. We also show that\nthe median value of expected SCA is best predicted by the step change in IMF magnetic field coincident\nwith the SSC event. This strong correlation between the median value of SCA and the IMF magnitude\nthat occurred during the shock has been formulated to aid propagation prediction.\n& 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\nSudden enhancements in the solar wind dynamic pressure are\nknown to compress the magnetosphere and enhance the\nmagnetopause current (Kaufmann and Konradi, 1969), as well as\nthe tail currents (Russell et al., 1994). Zesta et al. (2000) noted in a\nstudy of the 10 January 1977 disturbance that the response of the\nmagnetosphere to a pressure front was practically instantaneous,\nglobal and directly driven by the propagation of the solar wind\ndensity enhancement region through the magnetosphere. The\ndisturbance is transmitted throughout the magnetosphere in the\nform of hydromagnetic waves and has been observed both at\nsatellite altitudes and on the ground as a sudden increase or\ndecrease in the geomagnetic field strength. Corresponding to the\nchanges in geomagnetic field strength are changes in the\nmagnetic field geometry, the electric field configuration as well\nas changes in thermal and energetic particle distributions.\n1.1. Storm sudden commencements\nAn interplanetary disturbance in the solar wind such as shock\nwaves and dynamic pressure pulses (Wilken et al., 1982; Tsurutani\net al., 1995; Takeuchi et al., 2002a), when impinging on the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetosphere, compresses it and increases the magnetopause\ncurrent. This leads to a change in the low-latitude ground-basedll rights reserved.\nommunications Regulation\nlin 2, Ireland.\nitchie),geomagnetic field intensity, lasting typically for some tens of\nminutes. These signatures in the geomagnetic H-field, seen\nsuddenly and simultaneously at ground magnetic observatories\n(Rastogi et al., 2001) are called Storm Sudden Commencements\n(SSC) or Sudden Impulses (SI), depending whether a magneto-\nspheric storm is initiated or not.\nThe International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy\ncollate widespread observatory magnetometer data in order to\ncompile a list of agreed SSC events (IAGA). Burlaga and Ogilvie\n(1969), Gosling et al. (1967) and Ogilvie et al. (1968) have shown\nthe good correlation between impulsive changes in solar wind\nparameters and SSC signatures in the magnetosphere or on the\nground. The same researchers as well as Hirshberg et al. (1970)\ndemonstrated that SCC events are caused by hydromagnetic shock\nwaves and tangential discontinuities in the solar wind interacting\nwith the magnetosphere and a hydromagnetic description of SSC\nevents has been given by Wilson and Sugiura (1961) and Tamao\n(1964b, 1975). The SSC generated by these hydromagnetic shock\nwaves transform the magnetosphere into a new compressed\nsteady-state configuration, which is in balance with the increased\nsolar wind pressure (Wilken et al., 1982, 1986; Tamao, 1964, 1975).1.2. Sudden commencement absorption\nPrevious studies have shown that on occasion, brief iono-\nspheric absorption events occur promptly with the sudden\ncommencements of geomagnetic storms. Confirmed as particle\nprecipitation events, observed as ionospheric absorption occur-\nring simultaneously with the SSC (Ranta and Ranta, 1990), these\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nS.E. Ritchie, F. Honary \/ Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics 71 (2009) 609\u2013617610sudden commencement absorption (SCA) events occur most often\nat auroral latitudes (Ortner et al., 1962).\nThe first record of an absorption event of this kind appears to\nbe the one described by Brown et al. (1961) and was associated\nwith the SSC of 27 June 1960 and the assumption from this and\nother studies is that the ionisation in the lower ionosphere that\noccurs at the time of an SSC is due to X-rays, presumably\noriginating at a greater height from electrons entering the upper\natmosphere. The fact that SCA effects have been found to be\nconcentrated in the auroral zone clearly implies that the ionising\nelectrons are precipitating into the earth\u2019s atmosphere along the\ngeomagnetic field lines.\nOrtner et al. (1962) noted that when taking reading on a co-\nlocated vertical and oblique riometer (Relative Ionospheric\nOpacity Meter using Extra Terrestrial Electromagnetic Radiation),\nthat most SSC absorption events were strongest on the oblique\nriometer than on the vertical riometer. This is consistent with the\nconcept of a uniform absorbing layer, increasing absorption being\ndue to the obliquity factor for the oblique riometer.1.3. Energisation and source of SCA particles\nPrecipitation into the high latitude auroral zones is predomi-\nnantly through scattering of energetic particles from closed field\nlines, which are lost into the denser atmosphere. The scattering\nprocess is usually due to the growth of wave particle interactions,\nfeeding and extracting energy from the trapped, mirroring\nparticles and altering the pitch angle distribution (Kavanagh\net al., 2002).\nIndeed, wave-induced particle precipitation is often assumed\nto be the cause of SCA (Leinbach et al., 1970; Perona, 1972),\nimplying that changes in wave activity are triggered by the SSC\nthroughout a large portion of the inner magnetosphere. Since the\nadiabatic changes in particle trajectories can only increase\nthe pitch angle, adiabatic effects alone cannot increase the\nparticle flux within the loss cone and thus cannot account for\nall the absorption seen. With the assumed absence of other\nscattering mechanisms during the initial perturbation, theTime (U\nA\nbs\nor\npt\nio\nn \n(d\nB\n a\nt 3\n8.\n2 \nM\nH\nz)\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n13:30\nSSC\n13:45 14:00 1\nFig. 1. Riometer measurement from the central beam of the IRIS riometer at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi\n14:10UT, which is indicated by the long-dashed line. The peak SCA measured in this eincrease absorption seen must therefore result from wave-\ninduced precipitation (Gail et al., 1990).\nIn an examination of impulsive bursts of cosmic noise\nabsorption observed at the time of sudden commencement\nOsepian and Kirkwood (2004) related the occurrence and\nassociated absorption values with the perturbation in magnetic\nfield strength in the equatorial magnetosphere and explained the\nresults quantitatively in the framework of whistler cyclotron\ninstability theory.\nKikuchi and Yamagishi (1989) present compelling results that\nindicate that the energetic electrons associated with an SSC\noriginate in the trapped radiation belt. Using a scanning beam\nriometer at Syowa Station (Antarctica, L \u00bc 6.1) the authors\nobserved a distinct differences in the latitudinal features of\nenergetic electron precipitation and the time delay of precipita-\ntion associated with a SSC, and precipitation associated with\nsubstorms. The result strongly suggests that the SCA-associated\nenergetic electrons originate in the trapped radiation belt within\nthe plasmasphere where the closed field lines are limited in\nlatitude. Those particles precipitating during substorms must\ncome from outside the plasmasphere, most likely from the\nplasmasheet where access to higher latitudes is possible.\nIn order to find the best predictor of SCA based on one or more\nsolar wind parameters, a statistical study of SCA covering 6 years\nof data has been carried out and presented in this paper.2. Data\nFrom the IAGA list, SSC events spread across the years\n2000\u20132006 were selected for analysis. This period encompasses\nmore than half a solar cycle, from the sunspot maximum in 2000\nto the near sunspot minimum in 2006 and allows any dependency\non solar activity to be evaluated. During this period a total of\n201 SSC events occurred of which 26 were categorised in the\nIAGA list as possible SI events by one or more participating\nobservatories. To ensure only unambiguous SSC events were\nexamined, these 26 events were discounted, leaving 175 events\nthat form the basis of the findings in this paper.T in hh:mm)\nPeak SCA\n4:15 14:30 14:45 15:00\n(69.051N, 20.791E) on 3 April 2004, 1min resolution sampling.

Riometer data\nThe riometer is a simple instrument developed in the 1950s\n(e.g. Little and Leinbach, 1959) that makes medium-scale\nmeasurements of ionospheric absorption of cosmic noise at a\nfrequency in the order of 30MHz. Operation is passive and the\nbackground cosmic radio noise from the sky is constantly\nmonitored. By comparing the background cosmic radio noise\nfrom the sky against the received signal for an undisturbed day it\nis possible to determine the variation of ionospheric absorption.\nIn essence a riometer observes temporal variations in ionisa-\ntion in the D and E regions caused by charged particle\nprecipitation (Hargreaves, 1969), by electrons in the energy range\nof \u000210\u2013100keV (Wilson and Stoker, 2002). For each of the 175 SSC\nevents examined, data from the IRIS riometer at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi\n(69.11N, 20.81E, L \u00bc 6.06) was used to measure the peak absorp-\ntion resulting from particle precipitation caused by SSC shocks.\nAn example of such an absorption signature, from the 3 April\n2004 SSC event, which occurred at 14:10UT, is shown in Fig. 1.\nBefore the SSC the absorption was negligible. At the start of the\nSSC the absorption increases within 5min to 0.8 dB, peaking atFig. 2. Example of IMF data collected showing the sudden increase in the solar wind pre\ncomponents. Data from the 23 March 2002, 64 s averages used.0.85dB, 10min after the SSC event commences. Fifteen minutes\nafter the peak the absorption falls to less than 0.2 dB with some\nvariability thereafter due to subsequent magnetospheric\nactivity.\nExcluded from the dataset, by visual examination of each\nriometer record, are cases where absorption cannot be clearly\nattributed to the corresponding SSC events or where observations\noccurred against a background of solar proton precipitation. This\nensures that absorption phenomena other than SCA is excluded\nfrom the dataset.2.2. Solar wind and IMF data\nSolar wind and IMF data for this study was sourced from\nmeasurements taken by the ACE spacecraft. See Stone et al. (1998)\nfor details of the satellite and instrumentation.

Data analysis\n3.1. Effect of solar activity on SCA\nAs the data spans more than half a solar cycle it can be used to\ndetermine if solar activity influences the data set. This was done\nby evaluating the link between SCA and the change in IMF\nmagnitude against solar activity as reflected by the value of the\nrelevant monthly sunspot number.\nFig. 3 (top panel) shows a general spread of low, medium and\nhigh values of SCA at all levels of sunspot activity. Fig. 3 (bottom\npanel) shows a similar pattern in DB (the change in IMF\nmagnitude) at all levels of sunspot activity. It is concluded that\nthere is no causal link between SCA and sunspot number or\nbetween IMF magnitude and SCA, other than in the frequency of\noccurrence of SSC events.\n3.2.

However, as\nonly approximately 20% of all the events exceed 1dB the use of\nthe median value is a better representation the full dataset.\n3.3. Influence of local time on SCA\nTable 2 gives a breakdown of SCA statistics divided into day\nevents (6\u201318MLT) and night events (18\u20136MLT).\nWhile the occurrence of SCA is slightly greater during the day\nthere is no significant difference in the mean or median values of\nSCA between the two sectors. This illustrates that SCA occurs with\nsimilar characteristics during both the day and night. The\nresponse of the magnetosphere to abrupt solar wind enhance-\nments is a global disturbance directly driven by the solar wind,\nand we believe that the response is typically not that of a\nsubstorm. This confirms similar findings by Zesta et al. (2000) and\nBoudouridis et al. (2004).\nFig. 5 presents a histogram indicating the number of SSC that\noccurred in each MLT hour over the 6-year period. The average\nnumber of SSC that occur in each hour is 7.3. Using a w2 test the\nnumber of events occurring within each hour was evaluated\nagainst the expected value, assuming no change over time. The\ntest was also repeated after grouping the data into eight 3-h periods\nand assuming no change in the expected value, in this case between\nadjacent 3-h time periods. Both tests were not significant at the\n5% level indicting a random occurrence in the number of events that\noccurred both within each hour andwithin the 3-h groupings. This is\nin line with findings by Lee et al. (2004) that the solar wind pulse\nleads to a near simultaneous enhancement of the energetic flux at all\nMLT sectors at the geosynchronous orbit.\n3.4. Direction of Bz and SCA\nOf the 175 SSC events selected for this study it was not possible\nto ascertain the direction of Bz in 23 of the events due to dataunavailability. The movement of Bz during the shock was classified\ninto four possible types as shown in Table 3. The absorption\nstatistics for each of the 4 categories of Bz direction described in\nTable 3 follows in Table 4.\nThe standard deviation in the North and South events is\nskewed significantly by the presence of very large outliers. Rather\nthan remove the outliers, which are valid measurements, it was\ndecided to leave them in so that the standard deviation can reflect\nthe variance expected over a solar cycle. In 75% of the events, Bz\ndoes not change direction during the shock and there is an almost\nequal split between north and south maintaining Bz.\nThe similarity in statistics between all four types of event\nindicates that the direction of Bz has little impact on the typical\nvalues of SCA. This supports an assertion that Sudden Commence-\nment Absorption is not caused by particles from the solar wind\ngaining access to the high latitude zone but rather from particles\nalready captured in the magnetosphere. This confirms the same\nconclusion made by Paulikas and Blake (1970) in their paper\nexamining proton flux both outside and inside the magnetosphere\nduring the occurrence of SCC events.\nSCA is therefore not caused by southward turning Bz events as\nmore than half of the selected SCA events occurred during\nnorthward Bz movements, which in some cases continued even\nmore strongly northward after the SSC event. The examination of\nthese 152 events shows that similar precipitation events occur\nindependently of the direction of Bz immediately before or after\nthe SSC event.3.5. The link between the solar wind, IMF and SCA\nPerreault and Akasofu (1978) studied how the solar wind\nenergy is dissipated inside the magnetosphere during stormtime\nperiods. They defined empirically an \u2018\u2018energy coupling\u2019\u2019 function\n(e) as the fraction of the solar wind Poynting flux entering the\nmagnetosphere. While e is proven to correlate well to stormtime\nperiods it is compiled using hourly average values of variables and\nis not useful when studying short period (typically less than\n15min) SSC events.\nThere are other forms of expression based on different\ncombinations of solar wind parameters, which also correlate with\nsubstorm occurrence. There are many instances of substorms\nwhen Bz is southward, when Bz turns southward, but also when\nthe IMF turns northward having been southward for a few hours\nbefore. In particular it has been shown that geomagnetic activity\nis principally controlled by the solar wind velocity and the IMF\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nHour (MLT)\n0 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf  \nSS\nC \nev\nen\nts\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\nAverage (7.3)\n2 4 6 8\nFig. 5.

With the exception of the\noccurrence of shock waves, the velocity and magnetic field\nstrength are slowly changing parameters when compared with\nthe magnetic field direction. Thus, while the strength of the IMF\n(DB) and the solar wind velocity (Vp) may be very important\nparameters in controlling geomagnetic activity, it is the changes in\nfield direction, which correlate well with geomagnetic events in\nthe magnetosphere.\nFig. 6 examines the interdependency between the IMF and the\nsolar wind. The top panel shows the correlation between the\nchange in solar wind velocity and the IMF at the time of the shock.\nAlthough fairly weak, this is by far the best correlation as\nevidenced by the very weak correlation between particle density\nand IMF (middle panel) as well as between particle density and\nvelocity (bottom panel). The correlation between velocity and IMF\n(Fig. 6 top panel) could be explained by remembering that the\nsolar wind is magnetised plasma and that the faster, travelling\nshock wave will overtake the slower, preceding solar wind in frontof the shock. This causes the magnetic flux to be compressed at\nthe front of the shock with some proportionality to solar wind\nvelocity.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the velocity and magnetic field strength\nunder go rapid change (as do other parameters such as density)\nduring the shock and we need to test if there is any direct\nconnection between any of these quickly changing parameters\nand the SCA measured. One method to do this is to find the best\npredictor of SCA based on one or more solar wind parameters in\norder to clarify the affect of solar wind and IMF shocks on SCA. In\norder to do this a substantial body of work was undertaken to\ncorrelate each parameter shown in Table 1, with the absolute,\naverage and median values of SCA measured at the moment of\nSSC. The median value is a measure of central tendency that\nprovides us with a description of the entire data set and is\nespecially useful when data sets contain a few extremely high\nvalues that can skew the distribution, as is the case here. The\nmedian is less sensitive to extreme values than the mean and\ntherefore, it is a very good summary statistic to use when the data\ncontains outliers and is an appropriate measure when dealing\nwith the highly variable ionosphere and magnetosphere. It is for\nsimilar reasons and also convenient that hourly median values are\nthe standard output from HF propagation prediction programmes\nand using median values of SCA allows comparisons to be made.\nFig. 7 consists of four panels showing the median value of SCA\ncompared against the step change in IMF (DB) (top panel), solar\nwind velocity (DVp) (second panel), solar wind particle density\n(DNp) (third panel) and solar wind ram velocity (DRam Pressure)\n(bottom panel). A first-order regression is applied to the last two\nscatter plots and a second-order regression is applied to the first\ntwo scatter plots. The choice of only a first-order regression for the\nlast two plots was determined by the wide spread of values in the\ndata. Fig. 7 demonstrates the strong correlation between solar\nwind velocity and SCA but also the even stronger correlation\nbetween the IMF and SCA.\nBy a wide margin, the strongest correlation was found between\nthe median value of SCA measured and DB, the step change in IMF\nmagnitude that occurred during the shock. The fitted curve in the\ntop panel of Fig. 7, with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.852, is a\nsecond-order equation of the form:\nAm \u00bc 0:32\u0003 0:07DB\u00fe 0:0077DB2\nwhere Am is the median value of SCA expected and, DB is the\nchange in IMF due to the shock.\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nFig. 6. Scatter plot and first-order regression of DVp vs. DB (top panel), DNp vs. DB (middle panel) and DNp vs. DVp (bottom panel).\nS.E. Ritchie, F. Honary \/ Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics 71 (2009) 609\u2013617 615The fit for DB against median SCA is very good at values of\nDBo25nT, reducing somewhat at values of DB425nT. One\nexplanation of this apparent phenomenon is that there may be\nsome form of non-linear effect in the magnetosphere that only\nbecomes evident as DB exceeds 25nT. While this does bear further\ninvestigation less than 3% of SSC shocks in the data set generated a\nDB425nT, that is \u00025 events in a 6-year period.\nA further consideration in using DB as a predictor becomes\nevident when examining the differences in the y-axis of each\npanel in Fig. 7. When examining the solar wind velocity, particle\ndensity and ram pressure, the maximum median SCA does not\nexceed 2.5 dB. Compare this to the top panel where SCA values in\nexcess of 10dB can be predicted when the IMF is used as the\npredictor. The reason for this anomaly is that the ACE SWEPAM\ndata becomes unreliable in the presence of proton contamination\nand solar wind parameters are not reported (see for example\nNOAA, 2001a). These protons are invariably present following\nsolar energetic particle events (see for example NOAA, 2001b),which are often responsible for the disturbance in the solar wind\noriginally initiating the SSC event.4. Conclusion\nA detailed examination of sudden commencement absorption,\nthe absorption that occurs simultaneously with storm sudden\ncommencements has been undertaken in this paper. To the\nauthors\u2019 knowledge this is the first time that a statistical analysis\nof the characteristics of sudden commencement absorption has\nbeen published. The results in this paper have a direct application\nto real-time and near-time ionospheric propagation predictions in\nrespect of the prediction of the occurrence and expected\namplitude of sudden commencement absorption.\nBy design the dataset spans more than half a solar cycle and\nthis was used to determine if solar activity, using the relevant\nsunspot count as a proxy, influences the value of SCA. By\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nFig. 7. Scatter plot and regression of median SCA vs. (from top to bottom) DB, DVp,\nDNp and DRam Pressure.\nS.E. Ritchie, F. Honary \/ Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics 71 (2009) 609\u2013617616evaluating the link between SCA and solar activity and the link\nbetween the change in IMF magnitude and solar activity it is\nconcluded that in both cases there is no causal link, other than in\nthe number of SSC events that occur. This last point is not\nunexpected as higher sunspot levels reflect the increase in the\nnumber of active regions on the Sun that are the source of shocks\nleading to SSC events.\nFollowing the presentation of the basic database statistic, the\ninfluence of local time on SCA amplitude was investigated by\ndividing the dataset into day events (6\u201318MLT) and night events\n(18\u20136MLT). While the number of SSC events is slightly greater\nduring the day there is no significant difference in the mean or\nmedian SCA values between the two sectors. This confirms that\nthe immediate response of the magnetosphere to the shock is a\nglobal disturbance directly driven by the solar wind.\nIn considering all the possible combinations of how the\ndirection of Bz might change during the shock, the similarity\nbetween the statistics calculated for each of the four possible\ncombination leads to the conclusion that the change in thedirection of Bz in what ever combination has very little impact on\nthe value of SCA. This supports an assertion that SCA is caused by\nparticles already captured in the magnetosphere. If it was the\nalternative option that solar wind carried particles were gaining\ndirect access to high latitude zones than the change in solar\nwind\u2014magnetosphere coupling, caused by changes in Bz direction\nwould be clearly evident, which is not the case.\nIn an attempt to model the expected SCA values after a shock\nhas occurred, solar wind and IMF parameters were correlated in\nturn against the absolute, mean and median values of SCA. A\nstrong correlation (R2 \u00bc 0.852) was found between the median\nvalue of SCA measured and the step change in IMF magnitude that\noccurred during the shock. In some ways this is not surprising as\nDB is fundamentally an indirect measure of the changes in solar\nwind proton velocity (Vp). The fit is particularly good at DB values\nless than 25nT, which accounts for 97% of the SSC events in the\ndatabase. In addition due to proton contamination of the ACE\nSWEPAM instrument during large events, solar wind data are not\nreported, leaving the use of DB as the only reliable predictor of\nSCA during these times.\nIn summary the key findings in this paper are as follows:i. There is no causal link between the amplitude of SCA and solar\nactivityii. There is no causal link between the delta of IMF magnitude,\ncaused by the passage of the shock wave past the ACE satellite,\nand solar activity.\nThese first two points are very relevant to radio engineers in\nthat most propagation prediction programs only use a solar\nactivity index to predict performance\u2014the implication is that\nsome other method is required\u2014which this paper presents,\nnamely an empirical relationship based on the change in IMF.iii. SCA occurs with similar statistical characteristics during both\nthe day and night.iv. The direction of Bz before and after the shock has little impact\non the expected value of SCA.\nThe implication of these two points is that both of these\nvariables can be ignored when predicting SCA.v. The change in the strength of the IMF is the best predictor of\nSCA for small to medium shocks and the only predictor of USA\nthat can be used during large shocks.Acknowledgements\nThis research is supported by the author\u2019s employer, the\nCommission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), Dublin,\nIreland.\nAcknowledgement of the following sources of data is made:\u0004 The data originated from the Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric\nStudies (IRIS), operated by the Department of Communications\nSystems at Lancaster University (UK) in collaboration with the\nSodankyla\u00a8 Geophysical Observatory, and funded by the Science\nand Technology Facilities Council (STFC).\u0004 The ACE SWEPAM instrument team and the ACE Science Centre\nfor providing the ACE data.\nReferences\nBoudouridis, A., Zesta, E., Lyons, L.R., Anderson, P.C., Lummerzheim, D., 2004.\nMagnetospheric reconnection driven by solar wind pressure fronts.
