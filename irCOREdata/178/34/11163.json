The TRANSCAR ionospheric model was ex-\ntended to account for the convection of the magnetic field\nlines in the auroral and polar ionosphere. A mixed Eulerian-\nLagrangian 13-moment approach was used to describe the\ndynamics of an ionospheric plasma tube. In the present\nstudy, one focuses on large scale transports in the polar iono-\nsphere. The model was used to simulate a 35-h period of\nEISCAT-UHF observations on 16\u201317 February 1993. The\nfirst day was magnetically quiet, and characterized by ele-\nvated electron concentrations: the diurnal F2 layer reached\nas much as 1012m\u22123, which is unusual for a winter and mod-\nerate solar activity (F10.7=130) period. An intense geomag-\nnetic event occurred on the second day, seen in the data as\na strong intensification of the ionosphere convection veloci-\nties in the early afternoon (with the northward electric field\nreaching 150 mV m\u22121) and corresponding frictional heating\nof the ions up to 2500 K. The simulation used time-dependent\nAMIE outputs to infer flux-tube transports in the polar re-\ngion, and to provide magnetospheric particle and energy in-\nputs to the ionosphere. The overall very good agreement,\nobtained between the model and the observations, demon-\nstrates the high ability of the extended TRANSCAR model\nfor quantitative modelling of the high-latitude ionosphere;\nhowever, some differences are found which are attributed to\nthe precipitation of electrons with very low energy. All these\nresults are finally discussed in the frame of modelling the au-\nroral ionosphere with space weather applications in mind.\nKey words. Ionosphere (Auroral ionosphere; Plasma con-\nvection; Modelling and forecasting)\n1 Introduction\nWhile the climatology of the ionosphere is relatively well un-\nderstood and modelled, specification and forecast models of\nwhat is now called the ionosphere weather is the challenge\nCorrespondence to: D. Alcayde\u00b4\n(Denis.Alcayde@cesr.fr)\nof today. This weather is defined as the hour-to-hour, day-\nto-day, week-to-week variability of the electron and ion con-\ncentrations and temperatures within the framework of the cli-\nmatology defined by diurnal, seasonal, solar cycle and mag-\nnetic storm variations. The various processes of the solar, in-\nterplanetary, magnetosphere, ionosphere-thermosphere sys-\ntem that act to define this weather are today relatively well\nknown, e.g. Schunk (2001); Lathuille`re et al. (2002). Recent\nphysical modelling is based on global circulation models of\nthe ionosphere-thermosphere system coupled with time vary-\ning auroral energy inputs based on empirical models or ob-\nservations, e.g. Codrescu et al. (1997); Fuller-Rowell et al.\n(1996); Emery et al. (1999); Roble (2001). But these time-\nvarying studies were mostly successful in dealing with mid-\nlatitude observations of the ionosphere\/atmosphere, which\nare mainly controlled by the diurnal\/seasonal solar EUV\nsource, with magnetospheric inputs as global perturbations.\nAt mid-latitudes, these codes were mostly successful to\ncorrectly quantify the storm-time F-region ionospheric re-\nsponse. However, to our knowledge, there was no case study\nmodelling which was able to describe accurately the three-\ndimensional and time-dependent distribution of the iono-\nspheric plasma during quiet and disturbed conditions in the\nauroral and polar ionospheres. As Codrescu et al. (1997)\npointed out, their mid-latitude plasma density comparisons\nare good, while matching the structure in the polar cap and\nauroral zone is poor since they used statistical patterns based\non the estimated hemispheric power as high-latitude precip-\nitation and electric field inputs. Indeed, as shown by David\net al. (2002), at high-latitudes the coupling mechanisms with\nthe magnetosphere and the interplanetary medium are of the\nsame order, or even preponderant, as compared to the solar\nEUV control: the physical modelling must take into account\nthe time-dependent transport of the ionospheric plasma along\na flux tube, but also the transport of the flux-tube itself by\nthe ionospheric convection. Most recent observations, us-\ning, in particular, radar coordination campaigns (Valladares\net al., 1999; Carlson et al., 2002), aim at understanding the\nformation of localized ionospheric structures. Patchy struc-\n420 P.-L. Blelly et al.: TRANSCAR simulations of EISCAT observations\ntures as observed near the cusp and in the high-latitude iono-\nsphere, were modelled as responses to combined effects of\nion and the electron precipitation, and convection electric\nfield (Balmforth et al., 1999; Millward et al., 1999; Vontrat-\nReberac et al., 2001). Pitout and Blelly (2003) showed that\nthe overall result of cusp precipitation depends on the ori-\ngin of the flux tube that opens in the cusp region, and there-\nfore is dependent on the season, as well as on the interplan-\netary magnetic field configuration and on the magnetic local\ntime. But the subsequent transport of patches of ionization\nacross the polar cap, far from their production region (Crow-\nley et al., 2000), remains to be fully described and under-\nstood. The work presented in this paper adds to this mod-\nelling effort of the high-latitude ionosphere, and focuses on\nlarge scale transport. In the first part, we describe the new\nTRANSCAR model that accounts for both the convection\nof magnetic field lines and the temperature anisotropies that\nmay arise from intense ion drag and divergence of the mag-\nnetic flux tube. This model couples a fluid and a kinetic code\nand uses time-dependent particle and energy inputs given by\nthe AMIE procedure. It is used to simulate a 35-h EISCAT\nexperiment performed on 16\u201317 February 1993 at Troms\u00f8\n(69\u25e6 N, 19\u25e6 E, 66\u25e6 magnetic latitude). Observations are pre-\nsented in Sect. 3 and results of the simulation in Sect. 4. In\nthe conclusion, we outline the potential applications of such\nphysical modelling.\n2 The new TRANSCAR model\n2.1 13-moment fluid description\nTime-dependent transport models, with various levels of ap-\nproximations, were initially developed and intercompared in\norder to test the ability of each approximation to represent\nionospheric behaviors (Blelly and Schunk, 1993). Starting\nfrom the standard approach with the continuity, momentum\nand energy equations, complemented with the computation\nof the heat flow from Fourier\u2019s law, an 8-moment model was\nbuilt, fully tested, and calibrated using EISCAT observations.\nThis model uses the hypothesis of an isotropic Maxwellian\ndistribution function and adds the isotropic heat flux equa-\ntion to the standard set of equations to be solved. Each time-\ndependent equation is then solved for individual ions (see\nbelow), as well as for the thermal electron population. A\nfull model description was detailed by Blelly et al. (1996b)\nand different numerical algorithms were intercompared by\nRobineau et al. (1996). After an initial ionospheric appli-\ncation and description (Diloy et al., 1996), the model was\ncarefully calibrated using EISCAT observations (Blelly et al.,\n1996a), and subsequently and extensively used for ion com-\nposition (Lathuille`re et al., 1997), conductivities (Lilensten\net al., 1996) or total electron content (Lilensten and Blelly,\n2002) studies. The main underlying hypothesis in this ver-\nsion of the model was the pressure isotropy, with effects of\nthermal diffusion intrinsically included.\nAnisotropy effects can be taken into account by assum-\ning bi-maxwellian or even generalized distribution functions.\nSuch models were also developed (Blelly and Schunk, 1993;\nLeblanc et al., 2000), but their description falls beyond the\npurpose of this paper. The new TRANSCAR model still\nassumes maxwellian distribution functions, and is mostly\nidentical to the 8-moment model as far as the photochem-\nistry is concerned. But this model allows departures from\nisotropic behavior for the pressure tensor, through the stress\ntensor. Time-dependent \u201cparallel\u201d and \u201cperpendicular\u201d equa-\ntions are solved for the energy and heat flux terms, leading to\nthe so-called 13-moment approximation. Blelly and Schunk\n(1993) showed that this approximation is well suited for the\ncollision-dominated ionosphere, where anisotropic temper-\nature features can develop, due to the altitude-divergence of\nthe magnetic flux tube, and be reproduced with a good degree\nof approximation at medium to high altitudes. This model\nis also well adapted to produce temperature anisotropies in-\nduced by intense friction with the neutrals in the F1-region,\nduring strong ionospheric electric field events. But this par-\nticular aspect of temperature anisotropies will not be dis-\ncussed further in this paper which is focused instead on large-\nscale transports and phenomena, while anisotropies concern-\ning small-scale and sporadic features deserve independent\nstudy.\nThe fluid part of TRANSCAR describes the vertical\n(or more precisely, the IGRF field-aligned) time-dependent\ntransport of the thermal ionospheric plasma between 90 and\n3000 km altitude. Major ions found in the ionosphere are\ntaken into account and individually solved, namely O+, H+,\nN+, NO+, O+2 and N\n+\n2 , as well as the thermal electron pop-\nulation. A full description was given by Blelly et al. (1996b)\nand by Diloy et al. (1996).\n2.2 Kinetic description\nThe ionospheric electrons may be separated between the\nthermal population which is treated as a fluid population in\nthe previous section, and the supra-thermal population. The\nlatter is due to two main sources:\n1. Photo-production: the EUV flux energy is higher than\ntypically 10 eV, i.e. energetic enough to ionize the dif-\nferent neutral populations of the ionosphere. The ex-\ntracted electrons \u2212 called primary photoelectrons \u2212\nhave a kinetic energy equal to the difference between\nthe incident beam and the ionization threshold. The\nprimary electrons can have energy up to about 330 eV.\nSuch an energy is high enough to create secondary elec-\ntrons through collisions; indeed the energy required to\ncreate an ion-electron pair is about 35 eV. The primary\nphotoelectron production, due to the EUV interaction,\ncan be accurately described with a Beer-Lambert law.\n2. Electron precipitation: they occur mostly at high-\nlatitude. The energy of the precipitated electrons is\nhighly variable and ranges from a few tens of eV to\nMeV. They are therefore an important source of atmo-\nspheric ionization.\nP.-L. Blelly et al.: TRANSCAR simulations of EISCAT observations 421\n3. Ion precipitation (mainly protons): once the primary\nelectron production is taken into account in the mod-\nelling, the treatment of the secondary electrons trans-\nport is very similar to the production by electrons (see\ne.g. Galand et al. (1997); Lilensten and Galand (1998);\nGaland (2001) and associated special issue). However,\nion precipitation will not be considered in the present\nstudy.\nIn the terrestrial ionosphere, precipitating electrons or pri-\nmary photoelectrons move along the magnetic field lines,\ncreating not only ionization but also heating, excitation and\ndissociation. During an ionization process, the incident elec-\ntron is scattered mostly forward, whereas the extracted elec-\ntron, called the \u201csecondary electron\u201d, may be scattered into\nany direction (Opal et al., 1971). The vertical kinetic trans-\nport equation expresses the fact that the variation of the\nsteady-state electron flux with the scattering depth at a given\naltitude, energy and pitch angle, is the difference between\nwhat leaves that energy, altitude or angle slab and what en-\nters it (Strickland et al., 1976). It describes the angular and\nenergy redistributions of the electron flux from the top of the\nionosphere to the low E region. This equation can be ap-\nproximated in a relatively simple way. First, we assume that\nelectrons are predominantly transported along magnetic field\nlines. Secondly, the motion of the electrons is represented\nby the motion of their centers of gyration along the magnetic\nfield. The effect of ionospheric horizontal electric fields on\nthe energetic electrons is small and is neglected. The accel-\neration of the electrons is assumed to have taken place above\nthe modelled altitude range, and local field-aligned potential\ndrops and the mirror force from the converging geomagnetic\nfield are neglected. Finally, we can assume the stationary\nstate for the kinetic transport. The main reason is that the\nabsorption of the supra-thermal particles by the atmosphere\nis much faster than the changes in the source of those par-\nticles. The typical collision frequencies are of the order of\none per second, while the precipitation occurs over several\nseconds to several hours, and the photoelectron production\nvaries in a significant manner over a few minutes, when the\nEarth rotates. Said in other words, a secondary electron of a\nfew eV energy has a velocity greater than 1000 km\/s\u22121, i.e.\nfast enough to go through the ionospheric F-region in less\nthan a fraction of a second. Therefore, the stationary assump-\ntion holds on, and means that any time a supra-thermal parti-\ncle is absorbed, another one with the same characteristics (in\nterms of energy and pitch angle) is created. Of course, this\nalso means that the kinetic equation must be solved again any\ntime the external conditions change.\nVariations in energy or angle due to collisions are de-\nscribed through differential cross sections, deduced from the\ntotal cross sections as described in Lummerzheim and Lilen-\nsten (1994), and updated in Culot et al. (2004). An addi-\ntional energy loss arises from the heating of the ambient ther-\nmal electron gas due to hot electrons through thermal elec-\ntron interactions. This loss comes from the combined effects\nof two body Coulomb collisions and the collective effect of\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\u0001\b\t\n\u000b\n\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\n\u0006\u0003\u0004\u000b\n\u000b\u0005\f\u0005\u000b\u0007\b\n\r\u000b\u0003\u0002\u000e\n\u000f\u0002\u000b\u0010\b\u0003\u000e\n\u0011\u0012\u0006\u0006\u0003\b\u0005\u0013\n\u0014\u0007\b\u0007\u0013\n\u0015\u0003\u0006\u000b\u0004\n\u0011\u0007\b\u0016\u0003\u0004\u0005\u000b\u0007\b\n\u0017\t\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0003\u0018\n\u0006\u0004\f\u0003\n\u0005\u0007\u0001\b\t\n\u000b\n\n\u0019\u001a\u0014\u001a\t\u001b\u001c\n\u001d\u001e\u0019\t\u001b\u001f\n\u0014\u0007\b !\u0003\u0012\u0005\u0006\f\u0002\n\"\u0015\u0007\u0005\u0007#\n\u0004\u0015\u0003$\u000b\u0013\u0005\u0006%\n&\u0014!\u0001'\u0014\u0011\t'(\u000f!\u001a\")('\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0006\f#\u0005\u0015\u0003\u0006$\f\u0002 \u0003\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\u0013\n\r*+\u0014,\t'(\u000f!\u001a\")('\n-\u001f#$\u0007$\u0003\b\u0005\n).\/ # !.\/ # !)\/ # )\/ # \u001d\/ # !\/\n'\u0015\u0003\u0006$\f\u0002\t\t\t\u0003\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\u0013\n\u0019\f\u0010\b\u0003\u0005\u0007\u0013\n\u0015\u0003\u0006\u000b\u0004\n\u001a\u0007\u0012\u0006\u0004\u0003\u0013\t\n\u000e\u0003\u000e\u0012\u0004\u0003\u000e\n0\u0006\u0007$ \u000f\u0019\u0014\u0001\n\u001a\u0007\u0002\f\u0006 \u0001+1\n\r\u0002\u00122\n\u0017 \u00013 \u0018\n\u0017\t4  \t\u0018\nFig. 1.

In the lit-\nerature, this approximation is referred to as \u201cthe continuous\nslowing down approximation\u201d (Swartz and Nisbet, 1972).\nThe computer program solving the kinetic transport equa-\ntion, along with complete references concerning the cross\nsections used in the model, are described in detail by Lum-\nmerzheim and Lilensten (1994) and by Lilensten and Blelly\n(2002), and will not be repeated here.\n2.3 TRANSCAR: kinetic and fluid transports coupled\nThe two solvers (yellow boxes in Fig. 1) exchange infor-\nmation through the collision operator. The kinetic module\ntransfers to the fluid module the ion production rate, as well\nas the heating rate due to the coulomb interaction between\nthe supra-thermal electrons and the thermal population. The\nfluid module provides the thermal characteristics of the iono-\nspheric thermal electrons to the kinetic module. In Fig. 1,\nthis fluid\/kinetic duality is made explicit in the heart of the\nTRANSCAR model, imbedded in several surrounding boxes\nwhich correspond to the external driving sources and dissi-\npative sinks for the ionosphere. Firstly, the SUN (red) box is\nused to describe the solar EUV spectrum, scaled with a F10.7\nindex dependence. The ATMOSPHERE (blue) box provides\nthe neutral atmosphere constituents from the MSIS-90 model\n(Hedin et al., 1991), used both in the kinetic (energy degra-\ndation) and in the fluid (ion-neutral collisions) solvers, and\nthe neutral winds with the HWM-93 model (Hedin et al.,\n1994), which provides the dynamical coupling of the iono-\nsphere with the neutrals in the fluid module. Finally, the\ngreen box gives the magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction,\ndue to the convection which impacts directly on the thermal\n422 P.-L.

This complex box deserves be-\ning described in more detail in the following two sections.\n2.4 Plasma tube convection\nThe effects of horizontal transport, as for example, the fric-\ntional heating with the neutral atmosphere, are embedded\nin the new TRANSCAR model (Fig. 1). Despite the fact\nthat horizontal transport is not solved, the magnetic flux tube\nfrozen assumption nevertheless allows for this transport and\nfollows the time evolution of any flux tube transported by the\nconvection electric field. This is valid above 150 km where\nthe plasma is fully magnetized. Below this altitude, the ions\nare partially demagnetized, due to strong collisions on neu-\ntrals and such an assumption becomes questionable. How-\never, in this narrow region, processes like chemical reactions\novercome horizontal transport effects and we may consider\nthat the plasma dynamics is dominated by local processes.\nTherefore, the lack of description for horizontal transport in\nthis region is not significant.\nThe main purpose in the present study is to follow the time\nhistory of a flux tube, while it is transported in the polar cap\nby the ionospheric convection. But in doing so we face a\ntechnical problem. As a matter of fact, the core module\nof this ionospheric model is based on an Eulerian descrip-\ntion of the transport equations. This means that we follow\nthe dynamics of the ionospheric species in a frame which\nis fixed with respect to the ground. But the horizontal mo-\ntion induced by the convection is intrinsically Lagrangian,\nin the sense that the frame moves with the plasma tube.\nWhen the plasma tube is not vertical (Fig. 2), since the con-\nvection drift Vconv=E\u00d7BB2 is perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield, we couple the two representations through a drift of\nDATA\nMODELS\nEi, \u03a6i\nJi\n\u2206Bi\n\u03a3i\nJ = \u03a3 E\nE = - \u0001 \u03a6\n\u0001.J = 0\n\u03a6 J\/\/ ( E  ,  F )\nFig. 3. Synopsis of the AMIE procedure. The outputs for the sim-\nulation are the convection potential \u03c6, the field-aligned current J\/\/\nand the electron precipitation mean energy E\u00af and energy flux F .\nthe frame along the magnetic field, which is the \u201capparent\u201d\nfield-aligned component of the plasma drift Vmag in the Eu-\nlerian transport equations. The Eulerian transport equations\ncan then be considered Lagrangian with the addition of this\nVmag drift.\nThe code is built such that the convection drift, which re-\nsults from external forcing as far as a flux tube is concerned,\ncan result from statistical models of convection, or from ob-\nservations such as SuperDARN. Knowing the time history of\nthe convection pattern, it is possible to trace back (in space\nand time) the path of the flux-tube prior to its observation at\na given location. The flux tube is then modelled following\nits horizontal transport. This procedure was applied in the\npresent study. Each 10-min time step flux tube was modelled\nduring the 4-h period preceding the time of their \u201cobserva-\ntion\u201d, supposedly in the Troms\u00f8 area. This 4-h convection\ntime is larger than the characteristic time of the ionosphere\nF-region of about 20 min. The neutral atmosphere, which\nis completely specified in this study by the MSIS-90 and\nHWM-93 models which can use long time histories of the\nAp index, needs longer times to adjust, especially after in-\ntense magnetic storms. Numerically speaking, the 4-h period\nalso allows the tube to reach its \u201cnumerical dynamical equi-\nlibrium\u201d. As mentioned above, however, additional magne-\ntospheric sources for the flux tubes are of importance, such\nas field-aligned currents and energetic electron precipitation,\nand must be taken into account for real case studies. This has\nbeen possible by using AMIE as the magnetosphere source\ndriver for the simulations.\n2.5 Coupling with AMIE\nThe Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynam-\nics (AMIE) procedure has been used to derive the time-\ndependent large-scale distribution of the ionospheric convec-\ntion and particle precipitation. As described in Fig. 3, the\nAMIE procedure (Richmond and Kamide, 1988; Richmond,\nP.-L. Blelly et al.: TRANSCAR simulations of EISCAT observations 423\n1992) incorporates observed data, as well as a priori infor-\nmation from empirical models (red and blue boxes) to de-\nrive the convection potential 8, the field-aligned currents J\/\/\nand the electron precipitation energy flux F and mean energy\nE\u00af (green box of Fig. 3) that will be used as inputs for the\nTRANSCAR model. The AMIE grid scale used in this study\nwas 1.7 deg in magnetic latitude and 40 min in MLT. The\ndata include satellite measurements of ion drifts and parti-\ncle precipitation, radar observations and ground magnetome-\nter measurements. These data are used in a single weighted\nleast-squares fit of coefficients to determine the spatial dis-\ntributions of potential 8i , electric field Ei , current Ji , mag-\nnetic perturbations1Bi and conductivities6i (left part of the\nyellow box of Fig. 3). These distributions are linked by the\nequations shown in the right part of the yellow box of Fig. 3.\nModels of electric potential (Foster et al., 1986) and auroral\nparameters (Fuller-Rowell and Evans, 1987) are used to im-\nprove the estimates in the region where the data coverage is\nsparse.\nAMIE outputs over the polar cap and auroral zone are used\nin TRANSCAR in the following way: the polar cap elec-\ntric potential 8 is used to compute the convection velocities,\nwhich, in turn, are used to model the dynamics and chem-\nistry of each flux tube during the 4-h time period preceding\nits \u201cobservation\u201d. The AMIE convection velocities have been\nincreased by an ad-hoc factor of 2.5 to agree with the largest\nion drift observations at Troms\u00f8, as explained in Sect. 3.3.\nHence, the physical processes occurring during the time his-\ntory of each flux tube, prior to the \u201ctube observation\u201d, are\ntaken into account well, and their signatures are thus present\nin the simulated tube structure at the time when the tube\nis supposed to be observed by the radar. The AMIE field-\naligned currents J\/\/ are assimilated as upper boundary heat\nfluxes for the fluid model (Blelly and Schunk, 1993; Blelly\nand Alcayde\u00b4, 1994), while AMIE energetic electron precip-\nitation flux F and mean energy E\u00af are inputs for the kinetic\nmodel which computes the resulting ion production and en-\nergy deposition.\n3 16\u201317 February 1993 observations\nThe 16\u201317 February 1993 is a period which has been exten-\nsively studied. On 16 February around 21:00 UT, intense\nion outflows have been observed by the Akebono satellite\nand the EISCAT VHF radar in the nighttime auroral zone\n(Yoshida et al., 2000). On 17 February, at the Canadian Po-\nlar Observatory at Eureka (89\u25e6 magnetic latitude), auroral\nSun-aligned arcs were observed by Oznovich and McEwen\n(1994), most of them in the early hours until 8:30 UT and\nagain beyond 12:00 UT. In the interval in between, from 9:45\nuntil 11:15 UT, McEwen et al. (1995) observed, by optical\nmeans and a digital ionosonde, drifting F layer ionization\npatches. Although no interplanetary magnetic field observa-\ntions are available for these two days, the papers cited above\nshow that the coupling between the magnetosphere and the\nionosphere plays a major role in the small-scale structures\nobserved.\n3.1 Geophysical context\nOur period of interest occurs during the declining phase of\nSolar cycle 22 with a F10.7 solar index of about 130. 16\nFebruary is one of the most magnetically quiet days of the\nmonth, with a daily Ap index equal to 6, while 17 Febru-\nary is classified as a very active day, with a daily Ap index\nequal to 36. Unfortunately, no IMF data are available for\nthis 2-day period. Figure 4 (top panel) shows the temporal\nevolution of the AE(56) auroral index and the Ap three-hour\nindex for the 35-h EISCAT observations. The AE(56) au-\nroral index is calculated from 5-min average magnetometer\ndata from 56 of the 112 magnetometers used in the AMIE\nprocedure that lie between 55 and 76 magnetic latitude (52\nin the north, and only 4 in the south). The standard AE index\nAE(12) is based on only 12 stations in the Northern Hemi-\nsphere and can miss the intense electrojet regions for very\nactive or very quiet conditions. The 56 AE stations used in\nthe AMIE procedure AE(56) thus represent the magnetic ac-\ntivity more accurately. During the first 4 h, there is a small\nincrease in the AE(56) index which indicates that some auro-\nral currents are flowing in the ionosphere. AE(56) increases\nmore significantly on 17 February, with a large maximum\naround 14:00 UT. This large increase is also shown in the\nplanetary index which maximizes at 111 between 12:00 and\n15:00 UT. (Note that the 3-h Ap indices (no units) have been\nmultiplied by 5 and put on the same scale as AE(56) in nT).\nThe two other panels of Fig. 4 show, respectively, the mag-\nnetic field recorded at the Troms\u00f8 Geophysical Observatory\nand the ionospheric electric field (modulus) deduced from\nthe EISCAT UHF tristatic observations and the correspond-\ning one resulting from AMIE computations, scaled to the ob-\nservation by a factor of 2.5 (this scaling will be discussed\nlater in Sect. 3.3). Both panels show a small activity at noon\nand in the afternoon sector on 16 February, while a large\nactivity develops, with the electric field at Troms\u00f8 reaching\n130 mV m\u22121 around 14:00 UT the next day.\n3.2 EISCAT-UHF data\nThe EISCAT-UHF system was running almost continuously\nfor the 35 h starting on 16 February at 10:00 UT, with a\n1-h interruption between 01:00 and 02:00 UT on 17 Febru-\nary, and a few shorter interruptions, most of them between\n7:00 and 12:00 UT. The EISCAT-VHF radar was also run-\nning in a high altitude mode with the antenna pointing verti-\ncally. VHF data which allow the investigation of the very\nhigh altitude ionosphere have been used to study the ion\noutflows observed by the Akebono satellite (Yoshida et al.,\n2000). They are, however, not used in our own study, whose\nmain interest is the F2 region behavior. The Troms\u00f8 UHF an-\ntenna was aligned to the geomagnetic field line and Kiruna\nand Sodankyla\u00a8 looked at a common volume at 278 km alti-\ntude, allowing for the inference of the electric field in Fig. 4.\n424 P.-L.

Bottom panel: modulus of the electric\nfield inferred from EISCAT-UHF tristatic measurements, and the corresponding scaled electric field resulting from AMIE computations (see\ntext).\nWe used a post integration time of 1 min. The time\/altitude\ncolor plot of the electron density, the electron temperature,\nthe ion temperature and the ion velocity are displayed in\nFig. 5 (from top to bottom). During daytime one observes\non the top panel a very well-defined F layer. The diurnal\nF2 peak electron density reaches surprisingly to 1012m\u22123\nduring this period of low solar activity and winter condi-\ntions. More typical values are almost a factor of 2 lower,\nas can be seen in the F2 region parameters for 3 March\n1993 and 9 February 1999 (see the Grenoble Eiscat database\nat http:\/\/www-eiscat.ujf-grenoble.fr). In the evening of 16\nFebruary, F-region patches can be seen. The first of them\nis associated with an increase in the electron temperature, as\ncan been seen on the second panel. This suggests that they\nmay be due to soft electron precipitation. Much harder pre-\ncipitation occurs on 17 February, starting just after 12:00 UT\nand results in enhanced densities at E region altitudes, and\nenhanced electron temperatures. The main feature of the ion\ntemperature (third panel of Fig. 5) is the large ion frictional\nheating event between 12 and 14:00 UT on 17 February, as-\nsociated with the large electric field observed at this time.\nThe ion temperature increases above 2500 K. It is worthwhile\nto note that the data presented here are obtained with a nor-\nmal analysis of incoherent scatter data, that does not take into\naccount non-maxwellian ion velocity distribution functions\n(St Maurice and Schunk, 1977; Hubert, 1984), or changes in\nthe ion composition (Kelly and Wickwar, 1981; Lathuille`re,\n1987; Lathuille`re et al., 1997), that are likely to occur during\nvery high electric field periods. Therefore, the ion tempera-\nture minimum around 250 km altitude is just an analysis ar-\ntifact, and the overall ion and electron temperature increase\nmust be considered an underestimate (Lathuille`re and D. Hu-\nbert, 1989). The bottom panel of Fig. 5 shows the ion veloc-\nity parallel to the magnetic field, positive upwards. One can\nnote at F region altitudes a succession of periods correspond-\ning to upward and downward velocities. In particular, the up-\nward velocities observed between about 300 and 600 km just\nbefore 21:00 UT on 16 February are associated with ion out-\nflows oberved by the Akebono satellite (Yoshida et al., 2000).\nOn 17 February much stronger features of upward and down-\nward flows occur successively, mainly after 12:00 UT above\nabout 400 km.\n3.3 AMIE inputs\nFor 16\u201317 February, AMIE data sets include 112 ground\nmagnetometers including the CANOPUS network, the\nGreenland network, the IMAGE network, the SAMNET net-\nwork, the 210 magnetometer chain, and magnetometer data\nfrom the World Data Center A in Boulder Colorado.

Local noon corresponds to\n10:40 UT.\ndrift velocities have been obtained from the EISCAT radar,\nthe Goose Bay HF radar and the DMSP F08, F10 and F11\nsatellites. Finally, the electron precipitation has been derived\nfrom the same DMSP satellites, as well as the NOAA-12\nsatellite, assuming a Maxwellian distribution. AMIE out-\nputs are obtained every 10 min for the Northern and Southern\nHemispheres independently. Only the Northern Hemisphere\ndata have been used in the present study.\nFigure 6 shows the temporal evolution of some AMIE out-\nputs. The top panel shows the cross-tail convection poten-\ntial drop and the total hemispheric power (HP) that drive,\nrespectively, the Joule and particle auroral heating inputs to\nthe ionosphere-thermosphere system. The convection poten-\ntial reaches 50 kV a few times on 16 February and 140 kV\nnear 14:00 UT on 17 February. The electric fields from\nthe convection potential have been multiplied by a factor of\n2.5, in order to obtain electric fields above Troms\u00f8 of the\nsame order of magnitude as those observed by EISCAT (see\nFig. 4). Let\u2019s remember that the AMIE procedure deduces\nthe convection patterns from different sets of data, result-\ning in a smoothing of small-scale structures present in the\noriginal data. Samplings over 10-min time steps, and over\n1.7 deg in latitude, are also likely to contribute to a smooth-\ning out of large time variability. In the TIEGCM simula-\ntions of the November 1993 storm period, which used AMIE\ntime-dependent inputs to take into account the variability of\nthe electric field and its small-scale structures (Emery et al.,\n1999; Codrescu et al., 1995), the Joule heating term, which\nis approximately proportional to the square of the ion veloc-\nity in the neutral temperature equation, was multiplied by\na factor of 1.5 in the Summer Hemisphere, and 2.5-scaling\nin the Winter Hemisphere. In addition, predictions of the\nGlobal Geospace Circulation Model have led to polar cap po-\ntential drops that are roughly a factor of 2 larger than those\npredicted by AMIE (Raeder et al., 1998). Such a factor be-\ntween magnetohydrodynamic simulations and AMIE results\nhas also been found by Fedder et al. (1998) and discussed\nin detail. However, cases were also reported in which the\ncross-tail potential from the MHD model was comparable to\nAMIE results (Slinker et al., 1999). In the following sim-\nulations, the 2.5 scaling factor, obtained to match the local\nelectric field Troms\u00f8 measurement to AMIE convection, has\nbeen applied to determine the 4-h convection of each flux\ntube. This factor proved to work in the present case simu-\nlations, but must be considered as an ad hoc one, not to be\ngeneralized for other studies.\nThe hemispheric power is a measurement of the total en-\nergy input into the ionosphere-thermosphere system from\nprecipitating electrons. Its time variation follows the AE(56)\nindex presented in Fig. 4, with, in particular, a large max-\nimum from 12:00 UT to almost 18:00 UT on 17 February.\nThe bottom panel of Fig. 6 displays the mean energy and the\nenergy flux of the precipitation above Troms\u00f8 as given by\nAMIE.

This is con-\nsistent with the increase of E region ionospheric densities ob-\nserved by EISCAT (Fig. 5).\n4 Results of the simulation\n4.1 Simulation overview\nFigure 7 displays the simulation results, for the same period\nas for the EISCAT observations in Fig. 5, and with the same\naltitude and color scales. This figure displays, for every 10-\nmin time step, the flux tube arriving above EISCAT after\nfour hours of convection during which they were subject to\nthe varying solar illumination and varying energy inputs pro-\nvided by AMIE results.\nAt a first glance, the simulation reproduces quite well\nmany observed structures. In addition to the solar production\npatches of ionization around noon on 16 and 17 February, the\nsimulation quantitatively reproduces the frictional event seen\nin the ion temperatures between 12:00 and 15:00 UT the sec-\nond day, which results from the high convection drift distur-\nbance reaching 150 mV m\u22121 above Troms\u00f8 using the scaled\nAMIE ion drifts. The disturbance also results in a strong\nelectron temperature increase, originating in the thermoelec-\ntric effect which induces a field-aligned current which heats\nthe thermal electrons. This field-aligned current is obtained\nfrom the AMIE magnetospheric drivers (see Fig. 1).\nThe simulation also gives a rather good representation of\nthe sporadic behavior of the structure and dynamics of the\nionosphere after the peak of the event. Some electrody-\nnamic behaviors are also well reproduced, such as, for ex-\nample, the ion outflows above about 300 km, associated with\nhigh electron temperatures around 14:00 UT (sunset) for both\ndays, and starting around 06:00 UT (sunrise) on 17 February.\nThese are well known effects of heat flow around sunrise and\nsunset in the polar ionosphere (Blelly and Alcayde\u00b4, 1994).\nAll is not perfect, however. During quiet periods, and\nspecifically during the night between 21:00 and 24:00 UT,\nEISCAT observations show patches of ionization in the F-\nregion that the simulation is unable to reproduce. However,\nthe faint electron concentration increases, seen on the data\nat E-region heights during the same period, are more or less\nwell reproduced by the simulation. This illustrates the lim-\nits of the present simulation, which is based on an integrated\nanalysis by AMIE of the E-region electrodynamics, which\nonly considers energies above 460 eV from DMSP satellites\nin order to estimate the electron spectrum as a Maxwellian\ndistribution (Rich et al., 1987). The Robinson et al. (1987)\nformulas for the Pedersen and Hall height integrated con-\nductances, which are primarily sensitive to currents in the\nE-region, are used to convert the auroral mean electron en-\nP.-L.

Thus, AMIE\ndoes not consider low energy electron precipitation which\nproduces F-region ionization such as that seen by Akebono\nduring conjunction passes (Yoshida et al., 2000). Hence, the\nsimulation fails to reproduce these features.\n4.2 Effect of the convection on the diurnal F2 peak\nThese EISCAT observations were made during characteristi-\ncally quiet time periods, mainly on 16 February, followed by\nan event of strong electric field disturbance in the post noon\nsector of 17 February reaching 150 mV m\u22121 at the maximum\nof the disturbance. High electron density patches at F-region\nheights are seen in the data, following the disturbance in the\nevening sector. The simulation reproduces, at least qualita-\ntively, such occurrences of patches of ionization passing over\nthe radar. The time history of individual flux-tubes with such\npatches shows that the density intensification results from a\ntranspolar transport of flux tubes from sunlit and lower lati-\ntude regions, with northward trajectories from the sunlit af-\nternoon sector ionosphere, followed by a southward transport\nuntil the observation time. During the northward transit, the\nionospheric plasma was lifted up by the convection (Fig. 2),\nto higher altitudes, reducing the chemical recombination and\nhence enhancing its lifetime. The patch occurrences, in these\ncases, are therefore understood as being fossil traces of the\nsunlit ionosphere. The structures are transported in the night\nsector in complex paths due to the disturbance event which\nresulted in a complex reorganization of the polar cap poten-\ntial distribution, and hence of the convection patterns. This\nis shown in Fig. 8a which displays the path of a flux tube ar-\nriving in the radar field-of-view at 18:00 UT. During the 4-h\ntime period preceding the observation, the flux tube trajec-\ntory is modified every 10 min (i.e. the AMIE result sampling)\nto follow the scaled AMIE convection.\nAnother intriguing feature is the high electron concentra-\ntions at the F2-region peak observed during the quiet period,\nfor example, around noon on 16 February the concentration\nreaches 1012 m\u22123, during wintertime and moderate solar ac-\ntivity (F10.7=130). One of the simulation purposes was to\nunderstand how the ionosphere can be so dense under these\nconditions. Figure 8b shows the path of the flux tube that ar-\nrives above Troms\u00f8 at 11:20 UT, during the 4-h time period\npreceding the observation.\nFigure 9 plots the time evolution of this flux tube during\nits convection. The top panel shows the time variation of the\nsolar zenith angle seen by the plasma during its convection\n(red curve) as compared to the solar zenith angle at the radar\nlocation (green curve). The second panel shows the elec-\ntric field components seen by the flux tube during its trans-\nport, as deduced from the scaled AMIE convection poten-\ntial, and the bottom panel plots the corresponding electron\ndensity time-altitude profile. At the beginning of the period,\nuntil 09:00 UT, the flux tube is at a lower latitude than the\nEISCAT radar with a much lower solar zenith angle. The\nplasma in the tube is sunlit and undergoes a continuous in-\ncrease of density due to the solar production. Then, between\n9:00 and 10:30 UT, the flux tube is rapidly transported to\nhigher latitudes by the northward convection induced by the\n428 P.-L.

Historical evolution of the magnetic flux tube arriving at 11:20 UT above Troms\u00f8. From top to bottom: solar zenith angle of the flux\ntube (red line) compared to the solar zenith angle at the EISCAT location (green line), northward and eastward electric field components in\nthe flux tube, and color-coded field-aligned time-altitude profiles of the electron density (Log10 scale).\npositive Eeast electric field, resulting in an upward drift of\nthe F-region peak, lifting up the plasma at altitudes where\nits chemical lifetime is larger. Despite the associated decom-\npression of the plasma, the electron concentration continues\nto increase as the photo-production continues to be effec-\ntive in this still sunlit region. Finally, just before 11:00 UT,\nthe convection rapidly transports the tube southwards, with\na rapid descent of the plasma along the field line. This up-\nwards\/downwards mechanism is not symmetric in time \u2013 the\ndescent results in a compression of the plasma which induces\na further increase of the densities, whereas the chemistry in\nthe lower F-region, which starts to play a role again, is not\nfast enough to compensate for the compression. This series\nof transport mechanisms thus explains the surprising high\ndensities observed by the radar around noon, very well re-\nproduced by the simulation.\n5 Conclusions and space weather outlook\nThe study has used the new TRANSCAR model coupled\nwith AMIE results to model a 35-h set of EISCAT UHF ob-\nP.-L.

For each TRANSCAR time\nstep (5 min), the observed flux-tube was modelled during its\ntransport by the convection 4 h prior its arrival at the radar\nlocation. Most of the large-scale features seen by the radar\nduring its 35-h observations are well reproduced by the sim-\nulation. The main results of the data\/model comparison can\nbe summarized as follows:\n1. Some features result from local and more or less instan-\ntaneous mechanisms, such as the ion heating due to fric-\ntion during the electric field event the second day; the\nelectron heating around sunrise and sunset can also be\nconsidered as a \u201clocal\u201d mechanism;\n2. But many other features result from pure transport\nmechanisms, as the very high electron densities ob-\nserved by the radar around noon the first day, or patches\nof ionization in the F-region, transported from other\nplaces by the convection.\n3. The simulation has also shown its limits, due to the in-\nability of AMIE to reproduce the low-energy electron\nprecipitation, and the corresponding F-region produc-\ntion, seen in the radar data and not reproduced.\nFigure 10 shows the total electron content (TEC) as\ndeduced from EISCAT observations and the results from\nTRANSCAR: an overall very good agrement is found. But\nthe lack of information on specific F-region production, due\nto very soft particle precipitation, may significantly con-\ntribute to the TEC. Figure 10 shows that the high altitude\nproduction during the night (20:00-24:00 UT the first day)\ncontributes significantly to the TEC and is not well repro-\nduced by the simulation. The simulation also demonstrated\nthe fact that the ionospheric convection plays a crucial role\nin the auroral\/polar ionosphere, not only for the local dynam-\nics, but also for the redistribution, all over the polar regions,\nof \u201cfossil\u201d structures created elsewhere prior to their obser-\nvation. In this case study, the 1-D-ionosphere model (field-\naligned), coupled with a description of the convection and\nspatial distribution of magnetospheric inputs, allows a sim-\nplified (or pseudo), 3-D modelling of the ionosphere.\nThis demonstrates the feasibility of a realistic modelling\nof the polar ionosphere, and steps towards a workable model\nof the polar ionosphere for space weather purposes, pro-\nvided there is a parameterized model of the magnetosphere\ninputs to the ionosphere with four key parameters \u2013 the con-\nvection potential, the field-aligned currents and both soft-\nand high-energy electron precipitation. One further step to-\nwards a self-consistent model is under progress. The aim is\nto couple TRANSCAR with the Ionosphere-Magnetosphere\nModel (Peymirat and Fontaine, 1994), which can provide\nthese magnetospheric key parameters.\nWe shall also keep in mind that TRANSCAR relies on\nthe ability of empirical thermospheric models to correctly\ndescribe the polar neutral atmosphere. Progress is needed,\nparticularly for the description of intense storms.\nAcknowledgements.
