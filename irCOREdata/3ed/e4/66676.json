There was still a sense that urban and \nregional fortunes were intertwined and influenced by embedded power asymmetries \nwithin and between places, such that an effective local economic development strategy \nwould have to regulate inter-regional competition, guard against the consequences of \ntrends in the wider political economy such as heightened capital concentration and \ncentralization, and mobilize state action through active urban, regional and welfare \npolicies to redirect investment, jobs, and income to the less favoured areas. Classical \npolitical economy still just about held sway, drawing on the likes of  Marx, Keynes, \nMyrdal, Perroux, Innes, Hirschman, and Kaldor, to endorse the principle of the trans-\nlocal society of connections and commitments.  Regional disparities, measured in terms \nof (un)employment, productivity and welfare differentials slowly narrowed with the help \nof redistributionist policies, albeit without stimulating self-sustaining growth in the less \nfavoured areas.  Community, when invoked, as during the famous community \ndevelopment projects of the 1970s, was done so as a differentiated category (attentive to \ndivisions of class, gender and race) and as a means of socially empowering hard-hit \nlocalities.  It came with no major economic regeneration expectations other than the sense \nthat well-being was good for labour market participation or that community could spawn \nsmall-scale activity in the alternative economy.   \n \nThen along came neo-liberalism \u2013 backed up a vengeful New Right and a relieved \ninternational business community - to sweep away this mode of thinking and acting, \narguing that the society of connections and commitments interfered with the efficient \nmarket allocation of resources and growth potential, created a culture of dependency and \nexpectancy in the assisted areas and their inhabitants, was a drain on public resources and \nperpetuated unnecessary state intervention in the economy, conceded too much to the \nweak and their organizations, and to boot, failed to stimulate entrepreneurship and growth \nin declining or lagging cities and regions.  In the UK, the cradle of New Right thinking, a \npolicy revolution was unleashed in the 1980s, involving cuts in regional aid, giving \nbusiness free reign, re-orienting state support to underpin growth in the prosperous \nregions, introducing measures to promote entrepreneurship and innovation in the less \nfavoured regions, replacing democratically elected institutions by unelected quangos and \nbusiness-led organizations as key players in local regeneration, and refashioning welfare \nas workfare and welfare dependency as moral and social degeneracy.  Out went the hand-\nout philosophy and in came the get-on-your bike philosophy and business-knows best \nphilosophy, poised around a paradoxical understanding of the social.  The principle of the \nsociety of connections and commitments was jettisoned in preference for the principle of \nthe society of individuals and families, while the idea of community, when retained, was \nthrown at the hard-pressed areas as an expectation of moral conformity social consensus.  \nThe social was individualized and marketized by the New Right, reserved only as a \nresidual category to describe a malignant of dysfunctional social and spatial periphery.  In \nthe meantime, urban and regional inequality intensified across a wide range of indicators \nincluding health and morbidity, education, economic prosperity, housing, social \nbreakdown and alienation, and fear and insecurity without stimulating self-sustaining \ngrowth in the less favoured areas. \n \nThen, recently, along has come the Third Way \u2013 driven by new social democrats vengeful \nof both the Old Left and the New Right \u2013 to harness the idea of the society of connections \nand commitments to the principles of market freedom and unhampered growth in the core \nregions.  Here too, the UK government under New Labour, balancing on the shoulders of \nthe likes of Hayek, Giddens, Etzioni, and Putnam, has led the way in experimenting with \na new trickery that simultaneously works in socio-spatial inequality and equality (Hall, \n2003).  Third Way thinking is not confined to the UK, but is also inscribed in the policies \nof the EU in the form of active measures to promote social cohesion and equally active \nmeasures to promote competitiveness through market liberalization and deregulation, as \nit is increasingly conjured up by Left of Centre governments hampered by rising social \nand regional budgets.  The Third Way, sharing New Right concerns over redistributionist \nregional policies, has chosen to accompany market-led policies working for the more \nprosperous regions with a series of measures to boost the competitive potential of the \ndisadvantaged and less prosperous regions.  Regional competition, thus, is forecast to \nwork for both the core and the periphery through processes of regional specialization and \nthe mobilization of latent potential.  The Third Way has spawned a new localism \nunderpinned by policies to build regional capacity through the promotion of locally \nreferenced activity such as industrial clusters, technopoles, and local knowledge transfer, \nharnessed to various institutions of regional promotion such as regional development \nagencies, business-led regional assemblies, and devolution in general.  For the Third \nWay, there was to be no return to a hand-out policy culture, only the forward march to \u2018a \nhand-up-on-your-bike\u2019 hybrid couched in rhetoric of restoring power and capacity to the \nregions. \n \nThis repackaging of the economy and polity as a series of self-reliant territorial entities1  \nhas been accompanied by a similar repackaging of the social as the special feature of \nhard-pressed areas affected by high levels of unemployment and social stress or \nbreakdown.  Yet another hybrid, it rejects the New Right\u2019s skepticism of the society of \nconnections and commitments, but it shares its expectation of responsibility, moral \nuprightness and conformity from the down and out or marginalised, now, however, on the \n                                                 \n1 A new regional ontology that fails to recognize that one of the consequences of globalization is the \ndismantlement of regions as sequestered entities \u2013 see Amin, 2004. \nbasis of varied forms of collective provision and support.  The collectivist ethic of the old \nschool of social democracy has been restored, but its state-driven universalism has been \nreplaced by a conformist civic particularism, one that expects collective action from \ncommunities in particular places and for highly instrumental ends.  This new ethic is \nepitomized by talk of revitalizing social capital, community cohesion, civic \nresponsibility, public spaces, and the social economy within the hard-pressed areas as a \nbasis for their economic, social and political renewal.  The Third Way has taken the \nprocess of particularizing the social begun by the New Right a lot further.   \n \nWhile plenty has been written about the reinvention of the social by the Third Way as a \nnew governmentality of control, consensus, and social integration (Rose, 1999; Levitas, \n1999), less has been said about its subtle elision of social and the local, and about the \nimplications of this for urban and regional regeneration2.  This is the theme taken up by \nthis paper, beginning with a critical appraisal of the recent turn to local community (a \nterm used loosely here to incorporate all of the above listed aspects and expectations), \nand followed by an alternative designation of the local-social that is less instrumentalist, \ndecidedly a-moral (though equally ethical), agonistically political, and geographically \nunconstrained.   \n \nThe localization of the social \n \nThe rediscovery of the social by the Third Way as a policy instrument for local renewal \nhas been most actively pursued by the Blair government in the UK since the late 1990s.  \nIt certainly is the main plank of urban regeneration policies rolled out of the Office of the \nDeputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and powerful units close to Number 10, such as the \nSocial Exclusion Unit and the Policy Strategy Unit.  But it is also visible in a new spatial \nsensibility that has grown across other government Departments with a national remit, \nsuch as the Home Office\u2019s emphasis on community cohesion and civic responsibility, the \nDepartment of Work and Pensions\u2019 targeted labour market and social welfare schemes \nfor the most deprived areas, and the Department of Education and Skills\u2019 special schools \nfor inner urban areas.  This spatialisation of what traditionally have been national policy \ndomains differentiated on social rather than territorial grounds, is in part the product of a \nreconceptualisation of the problem of social exclusion as a problem of local origin and \nthe challenge of local regeneration as a challenge for local actors.   \n \nThis acknowledgement of place and place-specificity has brought about the shift from a \nculture of top-down universal policies available to all (but usually blunt to local \ndifference) towards a frame of provision for bottom-up and locally negotiated priorities \nthrough a patchwork of national spatial and non-spatial policies, plus strong central \ngovernment support for local initiatives based on community involvement.  Building on a \nstakeholder trend within urban policy introduced by their Conservative predecessors \n(biased towards initiatives driven by unelected quangos and local business elites and \nallocated through competitive national tender), New Labour has shifted the emphasis \ntowards a less competitive regime and towards initiatives with greater leadership from \n                                                 \n2 A notable recent example is Osborne and Rose\u2019s (2004) insightful account of the practices of \nspatialisation woven into different historical models of social improvement in the UK. \nlocal government, community participation, and stakeholder involvement in individual \nprojects (Marinetto, 2003).  My aim in this section is not to list or review the New \nLabour\u2019s policies on local regeneration, but to critically review the core expectations \nbehind a new Third Way governmentality of the social based on local community \nempowerment as the driver of both economic regeneration and democratic renewal.  \nThere are at least four overlapping assumptions knitting together a new standard for local \nregeneration in different national and local contexts.  \n \nThe first revolves around the concept of community cohesion, which, through varied \nmeanings such as the desirability of mixed neighbourhoods, shared public spaces, and \nsense of community itself, is held to inculcate regard towards others, civic pride and \nresponsibility, social confidence, and public participation (Kearns and Turok, 2003).  The \ncohesive local community is believed to be the empowered and responsible community, a \nforce in local regeneration through the energies and resources released by people helping \nthemselves and each other, looking after the local built and natural environment, \nparticipating in public life, taking up local responsibility through voluntary organizations, \nand, above all, raising their economic agency and potential through better social \nconnectivity and self esteem (Ilcan and Basok, 2004; White, 2003).  \n \nA closely related second expectation draws on the concept of social capital.  Varying \nlocal and national policy communities have begun to explore ways in which \ninstitutionalized and informal networks of trust, reciprocity and solidarity in given \nneighbourhoods, cities and regions might be encouraged.  This policy development is \nlargely derived from Putnam\u2019s general thesis on the mutually enhancing relationship \nbetween participation in civic associations and good governance (as state and civic bodies \nkeep each other in check and active) and between mutuality and economic dynamism \n(based on the economics of trust).  It is also increasingly sensitive to Putnam\u2019s distinction \nbetween intra-communal networks of solidarity \u2013 bonding social capital \u2013 which are \njudged to be inward looking and inimical to economic and political vitality, and cross-\ngroup or heterogeneous networks \u2013 bridging social capital \u2013 which are judged to have the \nopposite effect by reinforcing wider commitments and an openness to change (Putnam, \n2000).  The society of commitments has come to be understood as the imperative to \nbridge local difference and inculcate local obligation through networks of trust and \nsolidarity.   \n \nA third expectation is community participation, harnessed, once again, to an economic \nand a political goal. For example, over the last few years there has been an explosion of \ninterest among policymakers in North America and a variety of European countries, in \nthe restorative powers of the social economy, defined as trading activity (monetary and \nnon-monetary, formal and informal) in the hands of third sector organizations, self-help \ngroups, and voluntary agencies, in meeting local welfare needs through the involvement \nof the socially excluded (Amin, Cameron and Hudson, 2002).  Hard-pressed areas are \nseen as fitting for economic renewal through the social economy, because of the size of a \nlarge market of unmet needs (exacerbated by deficient commercial and state provision), \nbecause of reduced local opportunities in the economic mainstream, and because of the \nsector\u2019s ability to involve and employ the socially excluded as well as build their \nconfidence and social capabilities, so that they can become future workers entrepreneurs.  \nBut, social inclusion in the form of various types of community participation \u2013 from \npublic consultations through to civic involvement in regeneration partnerships - is also \nseen to be a political good in hard-pressed areas.  Community participation is expected to \nstimulate a sense of community, civic regard, civic energy, and active citizenship (a kind \nof diffuse democracy to complement the associative democracy. \n \nThe fourth core expectation \u2013 a summative one in many ways \u2013 is the idea of the society \nof commitments as spatially circumscribed.  This is certainly the assumption in readings \nof areas facing persistent economic hardship and social exclusion.  Local authorities, \nlocal communities, local organizations of various sorts, local branches of national bodies, \nare expected to interact in the local public sphere and work as a local political \ncommunity, often in designated spaces such as regional assemblies, to attend to local \nproblems directly or by pressing for more resources from the centre.  The local \u2013 a city or \nregion \u2013 is imagined as a jurisdiction beyond which the actors have no real business or \ninfluence, and as a political community that, through mechanisms of deliberation, \npartnership and shared interest, knows what is best for the locality and can deliver \nsolutions that work for the common good.  Local regeneration is premised around the \nassumption of a multi-headed, but consensual, political community with localized \nconcerns. \n \nAt face value none of this seems problematic.  Indeed, set against the legacy of state-\ndriven or market-based cultures of local intervention in the hands of remote and context-\nblind actors, the new thinking can be praised for recognizing at long last the power and \npotential of an enlarged democracy that draws on the creative impulses of an active civil \nsociety and a devolved polity.  Such a shift has long been advocated by the democratic \nLeft concerned with spatial equality.  So, why is it problematic?  My argument, which I \nshall develop below, is that it promises a democracy of misplaced assumptions and \nexpectations, one that will fail to both tackle the root causes of spatial inequality and \ndeliver the expected local returns.  Third Way localism suffers from a romance of local \ncommunity that in practice will be assailed from all directions and will be modest in its \neconomic and political returns, especially in the areas in which it is most expected to \ndeliver.  At the root of this deficiency lies a problem of spatial ontology in Third Way \nthinking associated with its reduction when it comes to dealing with the most deprived \nareas of the society of connections and commitments to local community, while \nparadoxically retaining a plural, less functionalist and geographically promiscuous \nunderstanding of the social for other spaces such as the nation or prosperous cities and \nregions. \n \nLet me develop this point first.  It seems odd that at a time of increasing connections and \nflows between places linked to diverse geographies of globalization which routinely \naffect all places albeit in different ways, we should think of some places as somehow \nspatially enclosed (Urry, 2003; 2004; Massey, 2004; Amin, 2004).  The history of areas \nexperiencing marked economic decline and sharp swings, slow and imbalanced growth, \nand institutional and social degradation is also the history of connections: the product of \nexternal control, dependent development, cumulative growth in the more prosperous \nregions, outflows of resources and skills, and so on.  They are what they are not because \nof disconnection (Graham and Marvin,  ) but because of particular forms of connection, \nwhich is why it is inaccurate to reserve the language of connectivity for the spatial \nmainstream and the language of lack of the means to connect for the latter places, as has \nbecome pervasive in Third Way thinking.  The effect of this slippage, however, has been \nthe replacement of a normativity of local regeneration through exteriority and \nconnectivity by one of bottom-up effort and local reliance.   \n \nIn the slipstream of this subtle fusion of the languages of disconnection and lack, \ncommunity seems to have been drawn into centre-stage as a vehicle for local \nregeneration.  It seems that for spaces that lie beyond the hard-pressed areas, the qualities \nof gameinschaft such as community cohesion and social capital are assumed to combine \nwith the qualities of gesellschaft (distributed power, state support, political agonism, \ncreative frictions of the open, differentiated and hybrid society).  Instead, in imagining a \nfuture for the less favoured and hard-pressed areas, the rich tapestry of the social \nconceded to other spaces is conjured away, as is the obligation to explain why the social \nthus defined should provide for economic and democratic vitality.  Only a narrowly \ndefined gameinschaft is kept in play, and this too, in a highly selective way.  Lack of \ncommunity is blamed for local degeneration3 without any critical appraisal of other \ncontributing factors - local and trans-local - or of alternative forms of social connectivity \nthat do not fit the stereotype4.  In turn, the restoration of community5 is seen to be the \nmainstay of local economic and political regeneration, once again, without critical \nassessment of what community really means and without serious analysis of the drivers \nof change and renewal beyond community.  The problem of \u2018failed\u2019 places becomes a \nproblem of eliminating bad community and replacing it with good community, with the \nunwritten assumption that if and when the policy efforts fail, the communities will have \nonly themselves to blame.  They will have chosen to reject community! \n \nHere lies the rub.  Through this confused babble of community, is emerging a new \npathology of local decline and renewal, backed up by a new science of measures.  The \nhard-pressed localities are now visualized as malignant organisms that require their parts \nto be restored and linked up through the tonic of community cohesion, local trust and \nactive citizenship.  Their future lies in their capacity for self-regeneration.  Associated \nwith this comes a strong morality of blame and praise.  Social life in the areas of \neconomic decline and social deprivation is seen as dysfunctional and morally deficient, \nlacking in trust, civic sense, social attachments, altruism, energy and drive.  The social \nsymptoms of decline\/deprivation become the subject of moral commentary and, through \nthis, thrown back as the causes of decline\/deprivation.  Much less talk now of lack of job \n                                                 \n3 See, for example, Putnam\u2019s negative observations on amoral familism in Southern Italy and the excess of \nbonding social capital in Black US urban areas. \n4 For example, diaspora-based social capital and citizenship, variety in types of social capital in different \ntypes of association, or friendship-based forms of trust and solidarities in new forms of family arrangement \n(Edwards, Franklin and Holland, 2003; Savage et. al,  2004; Goldbourne and Solomos, 2003; Werbner,  \n2002; Zontini, 2004) \n5 Defined and measured in highly selective ways, such as individual and social groups with particular \n\u2018social capital\u2019 endowments, mixed neighbourhoods, citizens\u2019 juries, engagement in shared spaces (see, \nBaron, 2004). \nopportunities, state obligations, equipping people for social and spatial mobility, rights \nand entitlements, the consequences of uneven development, productive ways of external \nlinkage, sustained investment in the local infrastructure, enabling citizenship, and other \ndrivers of well-being.  Instead, plenty of measures of participation in local and national \nassociations, elections, organized leisure pursuits, circles beyond the immediate family or \ninterest group, work and leisure communities, and so on, with the results thrown back to \nthe hard-pressed communities as evidence of lack and degeneracy.   \n \nThe new social morality, accompanied by a new science of measures and metrics, is \ncementing a new science of spatial organization and worth (Rose, 1999) that is gradually \nnaturalizing the idea that community spirit of a certain kind is essential for local \nregeneration.  Before long, once spatially fine-tuned measures of social capital, \ncommunity cohesion and political participation start to appear with regularity in national \nand international statistics (which is exactly what we see in the work of the World Bank \nand the UK Office for National Statistics), other policy perspectives on local regeneration \nwill find it increasingly difficult to make their case.  Worse still, the deservingness of \nplaces for government regeneration initiatives, together with their worth in a market for \ninvestment and attention that increasingly depends on quantitative rankings, will come to \nbe determined by these measures of community.  The symptoms of hardship will have \nbecome the measures of cure and discipline through sleight of calculus (Raco and Imrie, \n2000), while those in the business of building local community will come to measure \ntheir own success against the calculi set by the policymakers and funding agencies \n(Tooke, 2003).  In turn, those responsible for community action will become an \ninstrument for the \u2018domestication\u2019 of local politics, charged to deliver a consensual and \nresponsible citizenry that performs the regeneration expectations of ruling elites.  No \nlonger the collective voice of the disadvantaged, the marginal and the excluded, pressing \nfor alternatives that may well be a radical odds with the policy solutions on offer (Ilcan \nand Basok, 2004).  Community participation will have become an instrument of political \nconformity and control rather than a means for inculcating active citizenship without \nguarantees in a genuinely agonistic public sphere unconstrained by government fiat.   \n \nThe proof of community-based regeneration, of course, will lie in the eating of the \npudding.  Given the infancy of Third Way community-based regeneration schemes, there \nis not much evidence to draw on, beyond piecemeal information on the success and \nfailure of individual initiatives such as mixed housing programmes, community \npartnerships in neighbourhood renewal, or social enterprise schemes.  However, this \nshould not preclude an evaluation on prima facie grounds.  Perhaps the most obvious \nquestion is why expect so much from community in such places?  Why expect social \ncapital, participation, and cohesion to come to the rescue when it is in such short supply, \nand for very good reasons associated with the loss of confidence and hope, anomie and \natrophy, suspicion and distrust, social breakdown and circumspection, that accompanies \nunemployment, lack of opportunity, negative press and institutional abandonment?  The \ndown and out \u2013 if this is not to caricature the social pathology of deprived areas \u2013 are \nleast equipped and least motivated to play at such lofty community expectations, stripped \nas they are of the material, institutional, experiential, and possibly also the psychological \nmeans to associate with others not like them and to participate in civic and public life.  It \nsimply does not make sense to base regeneration on community in these contexts. \n \nLet us take the example of the social economy, and explore where it works.  In our recent \nstudy (Amin, Cameron and Hudson, 2002) which compared the strength, dynamics and \nlocal potential of social enterprises in Bristol, Tower Hamlets in London, Glasgow, and \nMiddlesbrough, we found there to be significant variations between the four UK urban \nsettings.  The social economy was much stronger, numerically and in terms of market \nsustainability, job generation and entrepreneurship, in the more prosperous and socially \nmixed areas of Bristol and Tower Hamlets.  This was because of a number of factors \nincluding the presence of a class of experienced and peripatetic social entrepreneurs, \nproximity to work opportunities in the formal labour market, commitment among \nproviders, clients, and intermediaries such as the local authorities and funding bodies to \nthe sector as a non-mainstream economic sphere, and a heterogeneous social structure \ncontaining the disadvantaged as well as community activists, a proactive middle class and \nother form of civic engagement.  Community spirit, prosperity, institutional capacity, \nconnectivity, and class have interacted in creative ways to sustain a vibrant social \neconomy, which, however, is by no means the staple of local economic life.   \n \nIn contrast, we found the social economy in Glasgow to be less vibrant and less diffuse, \nthe product of a history of a top-down partnership between the local authority and well \nknown community activists applying mainstream criteria of business efficiency to the \nsupported social enterprises.  The imperative to make these ventures succeed as a \nbusiness has put the imperative of community empowerment and alternative values in \nsecondary position, making the successful social enterprises \u2013 of which there are few \u2013 \nnot that different from mainstream economic regeneration efforts.  Not much community \ninvolvement here, but instead, a local leadership looking for new ways of meeting \ncommunity needs.  The experience of Middlesbrough has been worse.  With its history of \nbranch-plant industrialization, the area now faces extreme deprivation due to successive \nrounds of industrial abandonment and lack of economic diversification, with no social \neconomy to speak of.  The local authorities, which have recently stumbled across the idea \nof the social economy, do not know what to do with it because of the absence of \nsignificant interlocutors as well as their own inability to break with the legacy of top-\ndown economic management, while the few grass-roots impulses that there are, find \nthemselves hampered by a largely homogeneous social structure characterized by \nwidespread deprivation, welfare dependency and expectations of paid employment, and \nan economic context offering few job prospects, restricted social mobility and \nconstrained capabilities. \n \nWhat this evidence shows is that the social economy is vibrant in the most prosperous or \nsocially diverse areas that offer a wide net of institutional resources to spark and support \nthe sector6 as well as plenty of economic opportunities in the formal economy locally or \nnearby.  Even then, the social economy in such areas play a complementary role to state \nand market, as the circuit of responding to local social needs through the mobilization of \n                                                 \n6  Ranging from an active civil society and an established circuit of social entrepreneurs, to appropriate \nlocal authority intervention in a frame of democratic state engagement with the sector  (Graefe, 2002) \nthe socially excluded, often as a conscious ethical or ideological choice on the part of \nparticipants to engage in socially useful or empowering economic activity (Williams, \nAldridge and Tooke, 2003).  These are the kind of circumstances required in the areas of \nmarked economic and social deprivation for the social economy to play an adjunct role.  \nWithout them, the idea of economic regeneration through community involvement of one \nform or another is simply unrealistic, and potentially irresponsible, since the latter is \nrarely a pathway to formal employment or entrepreneurship among the socially excluded.   \n \nThis is not to assume, to come to the political expectations from community participation, \nthat poor neighbourhoods lack community fellowship.  Nothing of the sort.  There is \ngrowing evidence to show that reciprocity and mutual aid is common in such areas as an \nimportant way of helping out neighbours, friends and relatives struggling to make ends \nmeet7, in the knowledge that such help will be reciprocated some day when needed \n(Williams and Windebank, 2003).  Is this the wrong sort of community, as Putnam would \nhave it, in that it produces bonding social capital rather than bridging social capital?  This \nis entirely the wrong question, in my view, because what needs to be appreciated is how \ncommunity takes on different meanings in different conditions of economic and social \nwell being and in different institutional settings, as the social economy example has \nshown.  It is hardly surprising that community fellowship among the hard pressed, \nespecially in the most desperate of places, is both circumspect and socially circumscribed \nand that it is likely (though not necessarily) to become more associative, altruistic and \ncosmopolitan with improvements to people\u2019s material circumstances, social connectivity \nand well being.  It may be that the material circumstances in which bonding capital is \nproduced need to be changed, instead of relying on direct interventions to change the \npatterns of community participation, in the hope that this will yield better economy and \npolity. \n \nCurrent policy thinking seems to be keen on intervening directly to generate bridging \nsocial capital in poor neighbourhoods as a pathway to active citizenship8, based on efforts \nto build community participation on a \u2018ladder of involvement\u2019 ranging from \u2018simple acts \nof good neighbourliness at one end and a regular commitment with a formal voluntary or \nstatutory organization, or in a position of community leadership at the other\u2019 (UK Home \nOffice, 1999: 30, cited in Williams, 2003: 66).  Interestingly, though, Williams (2003) \nshows, on the basis of a review of recent community participation surveys in the UK, that \nwhile rates of both one-to-one participation and group participation are high in affluent \nareas, people in poor neighbourhoods, when \u2018active\u2019, tend to participate largely in one-to-\none activities along the lines outlined in the preceding paragraph.  This is a significant \nfinding, as it confirms that one form of community participation does not lead to the other \nform, without changes in the economic and institutional context of the neighbourhood.  \nSimilarly, unsurprisingly, emerging surveys of what community participation actually \nmeans in the context of partnership-based regeneration policies, tell the story of \u2018usual \nsuspects\u2019 routinely wheeled out to represent an apathetic or disinterested community, of \n                                                 \n7  See, for example, Das, 2004, on structures of solidarity among day labourers in Orissa in India. \n8 This is certainly enshrined in the thinking of the UK\u2019s Social Exclusion Unit and the more recently \nestablished Neighbourhood Renewal Unit, now responsible for driving local regeneration in poor \nneighbourhoods (Marinetto, 2003). \nopportunistic alliances in which local citizens and residents play at best a tokenistic role \n(in consultations rather than in decision-making and implementation), and of the absence \nof the poorest working class people, members of black and ethnic minority groups, young \npeople, disable people, women, homeless people \u2013 i.e. the excluded (Goodlad, Burton \nand Croft, 2004).   \n \nThe observations made in this section on the Third Way approach to local regeneration \nare not intended to devalue the significance of strategies of social empowerment and \nbottom-up development.  Far from it.  Indeed, where community-based initiatives have \nsucceeded in building social confidence, sense of ownership, civic engagement, \nsolidarities across the social divide, and a politics of local care, these can only be judged \npositively.  My objection, instead, lies with the idea of government by community itself \u2013 \nwith its narrow and parochial understanding of the society of commitment and \nconnections, as well as with the unrealistic and excessively high regeneration \nexpectations laid at the doorstop of local community.  The next section develops an \nalternative and less instrumentalist understanding of the local-social, which, in turn, \nimplies a very different approach to local regeneration based on a wider \nconceptualization of the society of commitments and connections. \n \nBack to the society of commitments and connections \n \nThe relationship between social empowerment and economic enhancement is not at all \nstraightforward.  First, because an empowered citizenry that lacks the means to control its \ndestiny as well as wrest power from or enroll others who routinely shape the world and \nits ways \u2013 others who are never that easy to identify or access, inscribed as they are in \ninstituted practices and habits, diffuse networks, hidden immanence, and distant places \u2013 \ndoes not possess the autonomy to make and distribute resources.  Second, because an \nempowered citizenry never comes with a common set of interests, which is precisely why \nso many programmes on the ground are assailed by a politics of uneven voice, social \nmanipulation, conflicting interest, and power imbalance; a politics that regularly \ncompromises the needs of the socially excluded and marginalized.  Third, because \u2013 pace \nthe communitarians and social capitalists \u2013 there is no direct link between social \nempowerment and economic regeneration or development, because this relationship is \nintermediated by structures of market relationships, regulations, institutional \narrangement, power configuration, and values and norms.  Thus, social intervention in \none place may lead to economic enhancement somewhere else or require other \ninterventions both there and afar in order to ensure local economic returns. \n \nThe implication of these opening observations is that economic regeneration in declining \nor less favoured areas cannot be based primarily on community-based initiatives, which \ncan only ever work on slow developmental time and with limited impact on local job \ngeneration and competitiveness.  Such initiatives have to be part of a wider framework of \nintervention that deals with the causes of local economic decline or imbalance, stimulates \nlocal economic demand and provision for it through the economic reinsertion of the \ndisplaced and the marginalized, bindingly links policies for competitiveness \u2013 national \nand local \u2013 to cohesion objectives, and actively decenters political and economic power.  \nIn short, they must be part of a wider national programme for economic development \nbased on spatial and social equity and political dispersal.   \n \nFor example, in a recent pamphlet with Doreen Massey and Nigel Thrift (2003), we have \nargued that the current approach to regional development in the UK, based on local \nboosterism (including community-led regeneration, promotion of local clusters and \nknowledge industries, and limited devolved government) will not reduce regional \ndisparities because it fails to tackle the secular centrism and skewed trans-regional \nconnections that persistently reinforce power and growth in London and the South East at \nthe expense of the disadvantaged regions.  Accordingly, we propose an alternative \napproach based on a serious commitment to \u2018decenter the nation\u2019, involving redressing \nmacroeconomic policies biased towards the growth regions, the introduction of controls \non further expansion in the South, the reintroduction of a redistributive regional policy, \nnational arbitration of competitive bidding for investment between the regions, the \nrelocation of major national cultural, economic and political institutions and remits to the \nregions, and policies for endogenous growth at the local level that are extrovert, but also \ndemand-driven and welfare-oriented.   \n \nThe argument here is that effective local economic regeneration requires a multi-polar \npolity in which the regions can run discrete areas of national life (rather than just a \nlimited set of their own affairs) as well as count on action by the state to redirect \nopportunities towards them, bolster their bottom-up strategies, and regulate inter-regional \ncompetition.  This is not an argument for a \u2018hand-out\u2019 approach to local regeneration, but \nrecognition of the principle of spatial mutuality and connectivity.  Without attention to \nthe wider institutional and market circumstances that shape local fortunes, community-\nled strategies will never amount to more than a fob to the hard-pressed cities and regions, \npossibly even a cold towel, as state welfare support and other redistributive measures are \nsubtly rolled back in the name of support for a community empowerment approach, while \nthe lion\u2019s share of policy attention and institutional arrangements for national economic \ndevelopment remain biased towards the most prosperous cities and regions.  It is simply \nperverse that the \u2018social\u2019 should be privileged as a tool for economic regeneration for \nthose areas in which it is thought that the \u2018social\u2019 is somehow deficient, while other \navenues for regeneration and other constraints on regeneration \u2013 national and regional \u2013 \nin these areas are left unexamined. \n \nIn turn, the areas that are expected to deliver community deserve a more respectful and \nless caricatured characterization of their social conditions.  The new literature on \ncommunity is richly condescending and morally prescriptive.  The hard pressed areas are \ntold that they all suffer from the same social pathology of lack of community in its \nvarious forms, that they are dysfunctional and have fallen from grace because of this, and \nthat without more community they will go nowhere.  In the meantime, society elsewhere, \nespecially in the prosperous areas, is deemed to be just fine!  An alternative approach \nwould be, first, to systematically identify the long-term and complex knot of reasons why \nparticular areas and particular social groups end up on the scarp heap, demoralized, and \ndriven to despair and desperate solutions.  For example, it is finally dawning on policy \nanalysts that the ethnic riots in the northern English towns of Bradford, Burnley and \nOldham in 2001, were not just about \u2018race trouble\u2019, and still less so about community \nbreakdown and youth indiscipline, but also about economic decline, structural \nunemployment, lack of job opportunities, institutional neglect, and embedded racism.  \nSecond, therefore, it would be to tackle these underlying factors, and provide individuals \nwith the means and opportunities to get jobs and become socially and geographically \nmobile as a means of social reintegration, instead of banging on about community \ncohesion.   \n \nThird, without in any way neglecting the harsh social realities and particular patterns of \nsocial behaviour in run down areas, it would be to acknowledge that such areas also are \nsocially and culturally heterogeneous, complex and conflicting in their needs and \ninterests, and as richly varied in local obligations and ties as anywhere else to family, \nfriends, neighbourhood, and civic community9.  They too are sites of sociality, \nattachment, and commitment, and while it may well be the case that the sociology of \nsolidarity among the poor is different from that among the better off, it is a heroic leap of \nlogic indeed to conclude that this is a bad or dysfunctional form of social capital, one that \nkeeps the poor and their neighbourhoods down.   \n \nForth, it would mean to concede a cosmopolitan geography of belonging to such areas.  \nThis is not just a matter of recognizing the diaspora attachments and belongings that \nweave people with transnational community links into \u2018networked spaces of meaning\u2019 \n(Scott, 2002) in service of a multiple and hybrid sense of place that more often than not \nincludes strong attachments to and claims over the neighbourhood and city of residence \n(Massey, 2004).  It is also a matter of recognizing both \u2018banal forms of cosmopolitanism\u2019 \n(Beck, 2004) that most people have become embroiled in through consumption, travel, \nand media engagement, as well as new mobile and distanciated publics that people are \nincreasingly part of and committed to due to the rise of new means of communication \nsuch as the internet, mobile phones and PDAs that allow relational proximity.  Rightly, \nMimi Sheller (2004: 42) asks, \u2018are such developments isolating people into cocooned \nworlds of solitariness, as Putnam and others fear, or are mobile communications enabling \nnew ways of organizing the spatial scale and temporal rhythms of interaction?\u2019  There is \nno reason to think of people in poor areas as people with bad local attachments that need \nto be made virtuous, and every reason to look into how their engagement in new mobile \npublics can be harnessed for local benefit. \n \nThis brings me to the fifth and final issue I wish to address in this section, namely how \nthe relationship envisaged by Third Way thinking between community and citizenship \nmight be re-conceptualized if a richer understanding of the society of commitments and \nconnections is also conceded to the so-called regeneration areas.  The new \ncommunitarians10 are right to desire active citizenship.  Who would deny this?  Active \ncitizenship is the bedrock of a vigorous democracy.  The issue, in my mind, is about what \nactive citizenship is desired for.   For the communitarians, it is desired largely for \nobtaining civic consensus and local community cohesion in service of a utilitarian \noutcome.  However, an alternative argument is that it should be about public ownership \n                                                 \n9 See. for example, Mumford and Power, 2003 for a rich analysis of family and community in East London. \n10 I use this term loosely to include social capitalists and ethical moralists. \nand participation in an active and contested public sphere, stripped of moral instruction, \nbut hopeful for the agreements that follow from agonistic engagement between equally \nempowered citizens.   \n \nThe regeneration areas \u2013 yes they too \u2013 are spaces of plural publics, contested claims, and \nirreconcilable understandings of the good life, in possession of a vitality that is only too \nfrequently crushed or manipulated by the dominant sectional interests.  In these \ncircumstances, social empowerment is a must so that vested interests and old hierarchies \ncan be challenged through opposition and dissent, culminating in a public sphere capable \nof supporting multiple publics and novel ones through the vigorous, but democratic, clash \nof oppositions.  A public arena deliberately engineered for community consensus \u2013 \nthrough partnership schemes, plans for mixed spaces and the like \u2013 is not an arena of \nactive citizenship, but an arena of a fragile and forced consensus that glosses over real \nand irreconcilable divisions.  Community building can end up as an act of \ndisempowerment, as yet another consensual fix for regeneration is put into place, now in \nthe name of active citizenship.  Instead, there may be merit in stripping social \nempowerment programmes of the language of community cohesion and social capital \nformation, and justifying them on their own terms as acts of enhancing the capabilities, \nvoice, rights and presence of the excluded and the marginalized, so that these social \nactors can become legitimate claimants upon the social turf, even when the claims are not \nconsensual.  The expectation of local public service and collective responsibility (usually \nanother name for cooptation into someone else\u2019s vision of the good life) should be \nsecondary to the aim of improving the life chances and aspirations of the disempowered \nand also providing them with the means to participate as equals in a democratically \ncontested public sphere11.   \n \nA common criticism of such a model of \u2018citizenship without guarantees\u2019 is that it is too \npromiscuous, and for that, a negation of solidarities around a local commons that the \nregeneration areas desperately need.  I disagree.  It is not proposed as a model of \ndemocracy that celebrates disunity and gratuitous dissent, but as one that recognizes \ndifference and seeks to build solidarities through negotiations of difference.  Iris Marion \nYoung (2002) calls this a model of \u2018differentiated solidarity\u2019, based on the twin principles \nof allowing people with social and cultural affinities with each other to affirm their \ndistinctiveness if desired, at the same time as finding practical ways of affirming an ideal \nof inclusion based on \u2018fellow feeling\u2019, defined as a \u2018mutual respect and caring that \npresumes distance: that norms of solidarity hold among strangers and those who in many \nways remain strange to another\u2019 (p. 222).  Young\u2019s definition of solidarity is clearly a \nvery particular one, and possibly uncomfortably utopian, but the point is that active \ncitizenship based on the exercise of individual and group rights12 is not necessarily \nincompatible with the idea of a commons without mutual identification and affinity.  \n                                                 \n11 To return to the example of the 2001 race riots in Northern England, the last thing that the protesting \nAsian youths (and White youths, for that matter) wanted to be told was to respect community, against a \nbackground of institutionalized discrimination, sustained marginalization, and vilification.  Repeatedly, \nduring and after the riots, their demand was for material betterment, cultural recognition, and civic rights. \n \n12  Including housing segregation, mosques, differentiated public spaces, and so on. \nSuch a commons needs to be worked at, and through all manner of experiment and \ninnovation that can only ever offer temporary and fragile truces, ranging from publicity \nfor the principle of living together in a multicultural society or for the dense everyday \nnetworks of institutional relations that bind difference, the de-racialization and de-\nstigmatization in general of narratives and rules of belonging and citizenship in a \nmultiethnic and multicultural society, controls on major institutions such as the media \nand other opinion formers on how they treat issues of difference and social worth, new \nforms of urban citizenship based on rights of residence and rights of influence in varied \ngeographies of attachment (Baub\u00f6ck, 2003), imaginative experiments in the everyday \nurban (e.g. communal gardens, youth participation schemes, school twinning, community \nservice) that bring people from different backgrounds together in prosaic joint ventures \n(Amin, 2002; Amin and Thrift, 2002).  Many more examples could be added to this list, \nwith each probably as controversial as the other, but what we can affirm is the real \npossibility of a commons without community. \n \nAs these brief remarks on differentiated solidarity reveal, the nature of the public culture \nof the commons in a given place, shaped by articulations of everyday local and global \nrelationality, is a crucial determinant of inclusiveness in \u2018regeneration\u2019 efforts.  Such a \nreading of the social is some way away from Third Way thinking on regeneration based \non community.  In Third Way thinking, the public culture of places is defined in terms of \nthe local balance between good versus bad civic behaviour, uses and abuses of public \nspaces, or the quality of local articulations of relationality, as though global articulations \nsuch as the impact of national cultures of belonging, media cultures, and diaspora \nattachments are somehow absent or less significant (Demos, 2004).  Instead, we might \nthink of the public culture of a place as a chora or an \u2018unplaceable place\u2019 (Kym\u00e4l\u00e4inen, \n2003: 240) that is nourished by manifold publics of varied spatial reach and duration.  As \nsuch, it comes to life as a place with a distinctive public culture only as a relational space \nof overlap and connectivity in these varied networks \u2013 the \u2018scene situates but without \ncontaining\u2019 (Weber, 2001: 187).  This immediately suggests that no locally confined \nattempt to build the commons is sufficient, that even the most composite and joined up \nattempts need to be constantly re-examined, and that even then the chances of success \ncome with a large measure of serendipity.  Perhaps the best we can hope for is to find as \nmany ways as possible to maintain a certain \u2018theatricality of the public sphere\u2019 marked by \na vigorous \u2018virtuosity of performance\u2019 by the many and not just the few, underpinned by \na widespread strong \u2018feeling for the world\u2019 that seems to have been lost in all the recent \ntalk of local society (Villa, 2001).  The case has to be made for active citizenship without \nstrings, built around many imaginative pragmatic efforts to empower the disempowered, \nperhaps also the emphasis tat early twentieth century US pragmatists \u2013 drawing on Adam \nSmith and David Hume - gave to the concept of sympathy in defining social capital (Farr, \n2004). \n \nConclusion \n \nAt one level, this has been a paper about \u2018spatial phenomenotechnics\u2019 (Osborne and \nRose, 2004), about how different imaginaries of space come to be regularized with the \nhelp of particular mappings of the social and associated measurements and remedies.  \nThe Third Way has conjured up a new practice of spatialisation based on locating social \nmalaise in particular types of geographical space, treating the latter as abnormal and a \nthreat to civic society \u2013 container spaces that can be rejuvenated through the magic of \ncommunity.  In the process, older notions of the society of commitments and connections \nbased on trans-local, trans-national, and universalist principles have given way to a \npeculiar socio-spatial dualism characterized by conceding some of these principles to \nprosperous places but only the imperative of local community to poor areas.  We are \nseeing the birth of a new normativity of cosmopolitanism for some and social capital for \nothers.   \n \nI have, instead, argued for an alternative spatial phenomenotechnics that rejects the social \npathologization of areas facing hardship, on the grounds that social striations do not map \nso neatly onto geographical space.  The geographies of the social in poor and rich places \nare equally complex and equally varied in composition, such that the society of \ncommitments cannot be so clearly demarcated in spatial terms.  As a consequence, I have \nargued that state and market obligations towards less fortunate areas must remain strong, \nthat social empowerment in such areas should be valued on its own terms as an exercise \nin building an active public sphere, that the social condition of such areas should not be \nseen in terms of lack but the potential for plenitude and societal reconnection without \nboundaries, and that experiments with social alterity (e.g. the social economy) have a \nplace in the mainstream and not just those on the margins.  The socially and spatially \ndisadvantaged, the experiments of alterity and democracy, are inextricably part of the \nsociety of networked longings and belongings and as much part of a democracy for all \nthat allows for action and intervention at varying spatial scales. \n \n \nAt another level, this paper has been about social and spatial obligations.  In its zeal to \nnot interfere in the workings of the market, the Third Way has thrown its weight behind \nthe prosperous, redefining its duty of care to the less prosperous as a duty of moral \nimprovement and community empowerment.  In the process, once-rich understandings of \nsocial and of spatial connectivity have given way to an understanding of society as a \nstring of territories charged with competing their way back into prosperity through the \nmobilization of their own resources13, especially community and civic mobilization in \ngeneral.  The unwitting result has been the funneling of the social into a narrow channel \ndepositing social capital and the like as a tonic for those in need of regeneration, \naccompanied by an impoverished and utilitarian but largely ineffective understanding of \nthe political and the democratic. \n \nMy argument, in contrast, has been in favour of retaining a more promiscuous sense of \nthe political and a more cosmopolitan sense of social and spatial connectivity and \ncommitment.  Thus, I have argued that regeneration cannot be a localist affair or a matter \nof local responsibility alone, but part of a wider political economy of decentred power \nand redistributive justice.  In turn, I have argued that local society \u2013 at least in areas \nfacing social and economic hardship - cannot be caricatured in the way that the Third \n                                                 \n13 Ironically, this rule is magnificently relaxed for the most prosperous areas, which are held to represent \nthe nation, and for this, deserving the attention of mainstream policies (Amin, Massey and Thrift, 2003). \nWay has tended to, but deserves to be understood as part of a cosmopolitan society, not \nblamed for its symptoms, but empowered without expectations.  There is a democracy to \nbe preserved and a right to be and become to be respected in such areas, including the \nright to engage freely, the right not to agree, the right not to play community, the right not \nto resolve your own affairs.  This is not asking for a return to the old days of dependency \non the state and others, only the suggestion that community empowerment alone will not \nremake economy and society in the hard-pressed areas, and also to ask why such places \nonly deserve local community while others are allowed to enjoy cosmopolitan society.   \n \nReferences \n \nAmin, A (2002) \u2018Ethnicity and the multicultural city\u2019, Environment and Planning A, 34, 6: \n959-80. \nAmin A (2004) \u2018Regions unbound: towards a new politics and place\u2019.
