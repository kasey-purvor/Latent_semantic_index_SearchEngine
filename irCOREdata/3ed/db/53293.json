Introduction \nBoth scientists and engineers alike have a great interest in understanding the interfacial phenomena \nbetween vitreous enamels and ceramic materials, since in many practical applications where vitreous \nenamels are fired onto ceramic substrates, the performance of the article is directly linked to the \nnature of the enamel-ceramic interface. Many studies to investigate these phenomena have been \ncarried out, however, they have been principally concerned with the wettability of zirconia and other \noxide ceramics on metals [1-5] as well as the adhesion of silicone sealants to aluminium [6] and the \ncoating of aluminium alloys with ceramic materials [7, 8]. The interfacial mechanisms investigated \nhave centred principally around the thermodynamic criterion [2, 3, 5], the electronic theory [4] and \nthe occurrence of oxidation [1, 9]. \nAt present, very little work has been published with regard to the use of lasers for altering the surface \nproperties of materials in order to improve their wettability characteristics. Notwithstanding this, it is \nrecognised within the currently published work that laser irradiation of material surfaces can effect its \nwettability characteristics. Previously Zhou et al. [7, 8] have carried out work on laser coating of \naluminium alloys with ceramic materials (SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), reporting on the well documented fact \nthat generated oxide layers often promote metal\/oxide wetting. Bahners et al. [10, 11], have observed \nand comprehensively detailed the changes in technical properties of various textile fibres, including \nadhesion and wetting properties, with a view to developing an alternative to the conventional \nmethods of chemical agents addition or wet-chemical pre-processing. However, the reasons for these \nchanges with regard to changes in the material\u2019s surface tension are not reported. \nThis paper describes a technique whereby a high power diode laser (HPDL) beam was used to alter \nthe wettability characteristics of an amalgamated alumina\/silica-based oxide compound (AOC) mix to \nfacilitate improved enamelling. Indeed, such a process has been employed by the authors to enable \nthe sealing, by means of laser enamelling, of ceramic tile grouts [12]. \n \n \n2. Experimental procedures \n 4 \n2.1 The amalgamated oxide compound grout and enamel \nThe AOC consisted of mixed vitrifiable oxide powders such as chamotte (mainly SiO2 (53wt%) and \nAl2O3 (42wt%)), Fe2O3, MgO, ZrO2 and ZnO was produced. The oxide powders were sieved to ensure \na particle size of less than 75\u00b5m, then thoroughly mixed together to ensure homogeneity, along with \napproximately 50wt.% diluted sodium silicate solution so as to form a manageable paste. The AOC \nwas then pasted on to an ordinary Portland cement (OPC) substrate to a thickness of 2 mm and \nallowed to cure at room temperature for 12 h. The composition of the enamel consisted mainly of the \nfollowing; SiO2, B2O3, Na2O, Mn, F and small quantities of Ba, Al2O3 and Ni, whilst the powder size \nwas less than 75 \u00b5m. The enamel frit paste was allowed to cure at room temperature for one to two \nhours and then irradiated immediately with the HPDL beam. \n2.2 Laser processing procedure \nThe laser used in the study was a surgical HPDL (Diomed Ltd.), emitting at 810 \u00b120 nm and \noperating in the CW mode with rated optical powers ranging from 0-60 W. The laser beam was \ndelivered to the work area by means of an optical fibre 4m long, and of 600 \u00b5m core diameter, the \nend of which was connected to a 2:1 focusing lens assembly mounted on the z-axis of a 3-axis CNC \ngantry table. The AOC was irradiated using the defocused high order mode HPDL beam with a beam \nspot diameter of 1.75 mm and laser powers (measured at the workpiece using a Power Wizard power \nmeter) of 20-55 W. The set compound was then irradiated using the HPDL and immediately pasted \nover with a thin layer (250 \u00b5m) of commercially available enamel frit (Ferro Ltd.) which, in order to \nform a manageable paste, was mixed with 20wt.% white spirit. Fig. 1 illustrates the laser processing \nexperimental arrangement, where the defocused laser beam was fired across the surfaces of the AOC \nand the vitreous enamel by traversing the samples beneath the laser beam using the x- and y-axis of \nthe CNC gantry table at speeds ranging from 300 to 480 mm min-1, whilst 3 lmin-1 of coaxially blown \nO2 assist gas was used to shield the laser optics. \n \n2.3 Wetting and surface energy characterisation procedure \n 5 \nIn order to analyse the laser treated specimens, they were sectioned with a Struers cutting machine \nusing a diamond rimmed cutting blade, and then polished using cloths and diamond suspension pastes \ndown to 3 \u00b5m. The sectioned samples were then examined using optical microscopy, scanning \nelectron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse X-ray analysis (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) \ntechniques. \nTo examine the wetting and surface energy characteristics of the AOC two sets of wetting  \nexperiments were conducted. The first set of experiments were to simply determine the contact angle \nbetween the enamel and the AOC before and after laser melting. The second set of experiments were \ncontrol experiments carried out using the sessile drop technique with a variety of liquids with known \nsurface energy properties in order to quantify any surface energy changes in the AOC resulting from \nlaser irradiation. \nThe enamel-AOC wetting experiments were carried out in normal atmospheric conditions with \nmolten droplets of the enamel (6000C). The temperature of the enamel throughout the experiments \nwas measured using a Cyclops infrared pyrometer. The droplets were released onto the surface of the \nAOC (treated and untreated) from the tip of a micropipette, with the resultant volume of the drops \nbeing approximately 15 x 10-3 cm3. Profile photographs of the sessile enamel drop were obtained for \nevery 600C fall in temperature of the molten enamel drop, with the contact angle subsequently being \nmeasured. \nThe sessile drop control experiments between the AOC and test liquids were carried out using: \nhuman blood, human blood plasma, glycerol and 4-octanol. The test liquids, along with their               \ntotal surface energy ( \u03b3 2 ) as well as the dispersive (\u03b3 lv\nd\n) and polar (\u03b3 lv\np\n) components, are detailed in \nTable 1. The experiments were conducted in normal atmospheric conditions at a temperature of 200C \nwith the temperature of the liquids themselves throughout the experiments also being maintained at \n200C. The droplets were released onto the surface of the test substrate materials (treated and \nuntreated) from the tip of a micropipette, with the resultant volume of the drops being approximately \n6 x 10-3 cm3. Each experiment lasted for three minutes with profile photographs of the sessile drops \nbeing obtained every minute, with the contact angle subsequently being measured. \n 6 \n3.1 Microstructural and morphological effects of laser radiation on the amalgamated oxide \ncompound \nThe oxide compounds of the amalgamation were bound together by mixing with 50wt% diluted \nsodium silicate solution. Sodium silicate solution (waterglass) is a viscous colourless solution of \ncolloidal sodium silicate. It is a silica containing aqueous solution that, when combined with other \nsolutions such as the amalgamated oxide compound, forms a gel-like mass of silicate hydrate. Such a \nmass remains soft and malleable until it is exposed to CO2 gas, either by means of a gas jet or through \ncontact with the atmosphere [17]. But, exposure of the hardened mass to water results in a reversing \nof the process and the mass returns to a gel-like state.  \nThe fact that the AOC in an un-heated state is hydraulically bonded, as opposed to chemically \nbonded, combined with the retention of chemical and mechanical water (that is water that is bonded \ninto the materials matrix and additional free-water respectively) means that the hardened mass will \nrehydrate when exposed to water [17, 18]. Heating of the hardened AOC mass fires the waterglass \n(similar to that of a ceramic material) [17], increasing its strength and enabling it to withstand water \nexposure. Thus, heating of the AOC is similar in effect to the firing of ceramics, in that the heating \ncauses gradual ceramic \u2018sintering\u2019 of the materials; generally bonding together and stabilising the \nsubstances [17, 19]. As such, exposure of the AOC to laser radiation results in rapid heating of the \nsurface, for most materials typically 103 to 105 Ks-1 [20]. This leads to the sintering of the AOC \nsurface with the removal of the pores between the starting particles of the compound, combined with \ngrowth together and strong bonding between adjacent particles [21], thus, a much more consolidated \nsurface is created. Indeed, surface roughness measurements revealed that the surface roughness had \ndecreased from an Ra value of 25.9 \u00b5m before laser melting, to 6.3 \u00b5m after laser melting. Also, it \nwas found that heating of the AOC above 1000C resulted in sufficient pyrochemical changes to \nprevent any rehydration.  \nFrom Fig. 2(a) it can be seen clearly that before laser treatment the surface of the AOC appears \ncoarse, with individual crystals of the constituent components being clearly discernible. After laser \ntreatment (Fig. 2(b)) there is more surface ordering, with the surface appearing cellular-dendritic, \nshowing that fusion of the individual particulates has occurred. Such a solidification structure is \nindicative of rapidly solidified microstructures [22]. Moreover, an XRD analysis of the AOC surface \n 7 \nbefore and after laser treatment (Fig. 3) revealed that, on the whole, the phases present within the \nlaser treated region were the same, however, their proportions were different. In particular, after laser \ntreatment it was not possible to detect any SiO2 whilst the Al2O3 was depleted. But, an EDX analysis \nshowed that Si and Al were still present in similar proportions on the AOC surface before and after \nlaser treatment. This indicates that partial laser vitrification of the AOC surface has occurred due to \nthe fact that these materials are glass forming elements, and as such, vitrified when irradiated. \nAdditionally, it is important to note that the peaks in Fig. 3 which are unmarked, for ease of analysis \nsince they are not of direct interest, are likely to be mullite (121) and (220), which provides \ndiffraction peaks in the range 350 to 400. Further, some formation of spinel (MgAl2O4) would perhaps \nbe expected, however, this was not detected.  \n3.2 Laser induced wettability and surface energy characteristics of the amalgamated oxide \ncompound \n3.2.1 Contact angle and wettability \nWhen a drop of liquid is placed on a solid surface it may remain as a spherical drop, or spread             \nto cover (wet) the solid surface [13]. The angle with which the liquid subtends the solid is known                               \nas the contact angle. In practice, if the contact angle is greater than 900 then the liquid does not wet \nthe solid and no adhesion occurs [13]. Once irradiated by the HPDL beam the enamel powder melts, \ntransforming to a liquid phase. As such, the process of the bonding of the enamel to the AOC \nsubstrate is determined by the wettability of the two component parts. The index of this effect is the \ncontact angle \u03b8, which the liquid subtends with the solid. \u03b8 is related to the solid and liquid surface \nenergies, \u03b3sv and \u03b3lv, and the solid-liquid interfacial energy \u03b3sl, through the principle of virtual work \nexpressed by the rearranged Young\u2019s equation: \n   cos\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n\u2212sv sl\nlv\n (1) \nClearly, to achieve wetting \u03b3sv should be large, while \u03b3sl and \u03b3lv should be small. Hence liquids of a \nlower surface tension will always spread over a solid surface of higher surface tension in order to \nreduce the total free-energy of the system [14]. This phenomenon is due to fact that the molecular \n 8 \nadhesion between solid and liquid is greater than the cohesion between the molecules of the liquid \n[13]. \nThe adhesion energy of a liquid to a solid surface (the work of adhesion) Wad, is given by the Young-\nDupre equation: \n   ( )Wad lv= +\u03b3 \u03b81 cos  (2) \nIt is important to consider also the influence of the substrate surface roughness on the wetting contact \nangle. Rough grooves on a surface, which may contribute to the influence of contact angles, can be \ncategorised as either radial or circular grooves. Any practical rough surface can be represented by a \ncombination of these two cases [23]. In fact two roughness parameters can be defined: the Wenzel \ntype, DR [24] and the Cassie\/Baxter type, FR [25] In the case that wetting spreads radially, as is the \nlikely case with the AOC, then the resulting radial contact angle, \u03b8rad, is related to the theoretical \ncontact angle, \u03b8th, by \n ( )cos cos\u03b8 \u03b8rad R R th RD F F= \u2212 \u22121  (3) \nAccording to Neumann [15], only if FR is equal to zero, then a model similar to that for heterogeneous \nsolid surfaces can be developed in order to account for surface irregularities, being given by \nWenzel\u2019s equation: \n ( )r sv sl lv w\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b8\u2212 = cos  (4) \nwhere r is the roughness factor defined as the ratio of the real and apparent surface areas and \u03b8w is the \ncontact angle for the wetting of a rough surface. It is important to note that Wenzel\u2019s treatment is \nonly effective at the position of wetting triple line [23]. Nevertheless, Equation (4) shows clearly, the \ninfluence of surface roughness on the contact angle is to cause an increase in the contact angle. Thus, \nthe smoother the contact surface is, then the smaller the contact angle will be.   \nAn optical micrograph of a sessile drop of enamel (200C) placed on the surface of the AOC before (a) \nand after (b) laser irradiation with the contact angle superimposed is shown in Fig. 4. The \nexperimental results showed that throughout the period of cooling of the enamel, from the molten \n 9 \nstate at 6000C to the solid state at room temperature, no discernible change in the magnitude of the of \nthe contact angle took place during the time of the experiments. This observation indicates that \nthermodynamic equilibrium was established at the solid-liquid interface at the outset of the \nexperiment [26].  \nFig. 4 shows clearly that prior to laser melting it was not possible to fire the enamel onto the surface \nof the AOC since the contact angle was measured as 1180, and as such would prevent the enamel \nfrom wetting the AOC surface. Indeed, laser interaction with the enamel when placed on the \nuntreated AOC surface simply resulted in the \u2018balling\u2019 of the enamel; the formation of small spheres \napproximately the diameter of the laser beam itself [27, 28].  \nOne explanation for the fact that laser melting of the AOC is necessary so that the enamel completely \nwets and adheres to the surface of the AOC is that the surface resulting from the laser melting is \nsignificantly smoother, with an Ra value of 25.9 \u00b5m compared with 6.3 \u00b5m. Similar results were \nobtained by Nicolas et al. [29], who observed that excimer laser treatment of a ZrO2 ceramic resulted \nin a smoother surface. Thus, according to Equation (3), will intrinsically affect a reduction in the \ncontact angle (Table 2). Indeed, Fig. 5 shows clearly the effect of the laser treated AOC surface \nroughness on the contact angle. For experimental purposes the liquid used was glycerol. Such results \nare in accord with those obtained by Feng et al. [30], who noted that contact angle was inversely \nproportional to surface roughness. \nAdditionally, wetting will have certainly been influenced by the increase in the oxygen content of the \nAOC surface as a result of the laser treatment, since this interaction is known to increase the \nlikelihood of wetting [1, 9]. Indeed, by mounting cross-sectioned samples of the untreated and laser \ntreated AOC next to each other, and examining them both simultaneously by means of EDX, it is \npossible to determine the relative element content of oxygen near to the surface. Values of 28% and \n39% for the untreated and laser treated AOC respectively were obtained from such an EDX analysis \nwhich probed to a depth of approximately 1 \u00b5m below the surface of both samples (Table 2). As one \ncan see, an increase of 36% in the amount of oxygen due to the oxidisation on the laser treated \nsurface of AOC has occurred, indicating that oxygen enrichment of the laser treated AOC surface is \nactive in promoting wetting and bonding. \n3.2.2 Amalgamated oxide compound surface energy and its dispersive\/polar character \n 10 \nThe intermolecular attraction which is responsible for surface energy, \u03b3, results from a variety of \nintermolecular forces whose contribution to the total surface energy is additive [16]. The majority of \nthese forces are functions of the particular chemical nature of a certain material, and as such the total \nsurface energy comprises of \u03b3p (polar or non-dispersive interaction) and \u03b3d (dispersive component; \nsince van der Waals forces are present in all systems regardless of their chemical nature). Therefore, \nthe surface energy of any system may be described by [16] \n \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3= +d p  (5) \nSimilarly, Wad can be expressed as the sum of the different intermolecular forces that act at the \ninterface between the solid-liquid interface [31]: \n ( ) ( )W W Wad add adp svd lvd svp lvp= + = +2 2\n1 2 1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\/ \/\n (6) \nBy equating Equation (6) with Equation (2), the contact angle for solid-liquid systems can be related \nto the surface energies of the respective liquid and solid by \n \n( ) ( )\ncos\n\/ \/\n\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n+\n\u2212\n2 2\n1\n1 2 1 2\nsv\nd\nlv\nd\nsv\np\nlv\np\nlv\n (7) \nIt is possible to adequately estimate the dispersive component of the AOC surface energy \u03b3 sv\nd\n by \nusing Equation (7), and plotting the graph of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv. Thus the value of \u03b3 sv\nd\n is \nestimated by the gradient (=2(\u03b3 sv\nd\n)1\/2) of the line which connects the origin (cos \u03b8 = -1) with the \nintercept point of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv) correlating the data point with the \nabscissa at cos \u03b8 = 1 [16]. Fig. 6 shows the best-fit plot of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv according to \nEquation (7) for the untreated and laser treated AOC-experimental control liquids system. Comparing \nthe ordinate intercept points of the untreated and laser treated AOC-liquid systems, it can be seen \nclearly from Fig. 6 that for the untreated AOC-liquid systems the best-fit straight line intercepts the \nordinate closer to the origin. This observation indicates that, in principle, dispersion forces act mainly \nat the AOC-liquid interfaces resulting in poor adhesion [16, 31]. In contrast, Fig. 6 shows that the \nbest-fit straight line for the laser treated AOC-liquid systems intercepts the ordinate considerably \n 11 \nhigher above the origin. This result is indicative of the action of polar forces across the interface, in \naddition to dispersion forces, hence improved wettability and adhesion is promoted [16, 31]. \nIt is not possible to determine the value of the polar component of the AOC surface energy \u03b3 sv\np\n \ndirectly from Fig. 6, because the intercept of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv) is at \n( )2\n1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3sv\np\nlv\np\n\/\n\/\u03b3lv, and thus only refers to individual control liquids and not the control liquid system. \nHowever, it has been established that the entire amount of the surface energies due to dispersion \nforces either of the solids or the liquids are active in the wettability performance [16, 32]. Thus it is \npossible to calculate the dispersive component of the work of adhesion, Wad\nd\n from Equation (6). The \nresults reveal that for each particular control liquid in contact with both the untreated and laser \ntreated AOC surfaces, Wad  can be correlated with Wad\nd\n by the relationship \n W aW bad ad\nd= +  (8) \nAlso, for the control test liquids used, a linear relationship between the dispersive and polar \ncomponents of the control test liquids surface energies has been deduced which satisfies the equation \n  ( ) ( )\u03b3 \u03b3lvp lvd\n1 2 1 2\n13 115\n\/ \/\n. .= +  (9) \nBy introducing Equation (8) into Equation (6) and rearranging, then \n  ( )W a W bad\np\nad\nd= \u2212 +1  (10) \nBy combining Equation (10) with Equation (6) and differentiating with respect to ( )\u03b3 lvd\n1 2\/\n, then the \nfollowing can be derived: \n  ( )\n( ) ( )\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nsv\np sv\nd a1 2\n1 2\n1\n13\n\/\n\/\n.\n=\n\u2212\n (11) \nFrom a plot of Equation (10), a can be determined for the untreated and laser treated AOC (1.2 and \n1.7 respectively). Since \u03b3 sv\nd\n has already been determined for the untreated and laser treated AOC \n 12 \nfrom Fig. 6, then it is possible to calculate \u03b3 sv\np\n for untreated and laser treated AOC using Equation \n(11). \nTable 2 details the values determined for \u03b3 sv\nd\n and \u03b3 sv\np\n for both the untreated and laser treated AOC. \nClearly the HPDL melting of the surface of the AOC leads to a reduction in the total surface energy \n\u03b3sv, whilst increasing the polar component of the surface energy \u03b3 sv\np\n, thus improving the action of \nwetting and adhesion. Such changes in the surface energy of the AOC after laser melting are due to \nthe fact that HPDL melting of the surface of the AOC results in partial vitrification of the surface; a \ntransition that is known to affect a reduction in  \u03b3sv  and an increase in \u03b3 sv\np\n [26]. \nIt is important to note that because of the long range ionic interactions in the AOC and the composite \nnature of the interfaces between the AOC and the liquids, it is highly likely that the \nthermodynamically defined total solid surface energy , \u03b3, as defined in Equation (2), will be higher \nthan the sum of the dispersive, \u03b3d, and the polar, \u03b3p, components of the surface energy. Although the \nincrease in (excess) surface free energy will probably be less then the increase in the total lattice \nenergy. On the other hand an absorbed liquid layer may shield the ionic fields substantially. As such, \nall the data derived from Equations (6) - (11) should be considered as being semi-empirical. \nNotwithstanding this, as the studies by Gutowski et al.[6] and Agathopoulos et al. [26] found, it is \nreasonable to conclude from the data obtained from Equations (6) - (11) that HPDL treatment of the \nAOC surface has caused an increase in the polar component, \u03b3p, of the surface energy. \n3.3 Influence of surface melting on wettability \nIt is important to determine the degree of laser treatment necessary to facilitate such surface energy \nchanges. In particular, to establish what role melting, which is inherently influenced by the power \ndensity, of the AOC surface plays in the promotion of wetting. In order to analyse the effect melting \nof the AOC surface has on the wettability performance, a series of wetting experiments using the \nenamel were conducted to determine the contact angle for a range of power densities. The \nexperiments were carried with an O2 shield gas at a traverse speed of 240 mm min\n-1. The contact \nangle measurement procedure was as described in Section 3.3. The surface condition of the laser \n 13 \ntreated AOC was determined by means of SEM analysis. The relationship between the contact angle \nand the power density is shown in Fig. 7. \nAs can be seen clearly from Fig. 7, the surface condition of the laser treated AOC has a significant \neffect on the contact angle. In particular, Fig. 7 indicates that the melting, and thus the partial \nvitrification of the glass forming elements (SiO2 and Al2O3) within the AOC, is an essential \nprerequisite in order for significant reductions in the contact angle to be realised. As one can see, \nafter the onset of melting at around 0.9 kWcm-2 the contact angle reduces sharply from 1130 to 330, \nafter which no further decrease (or increase) is discernible until the power density exceeds                \n2.1 kWcm-2. After this point a small increase in the contact angle from 330 to 390 was observed. This \nincrease is probably due to the fact that this power density level lies outside of the optimum operating \nconditions for the traverse speed used in the experiments, and as such, will cause an increase in the \nsurface roughness which, as was seen earlier, has a small but discernible effect on the contact angle. \nFurthermore, the melt depth observed within the region of the optimum operating conditions                     \nin which significant changes to the contact angle were achieved was measured as being from                   \n50 to 125 \u00b5m. Figure 8 shows a typical cross-section through the laser treated AOC, showing the \nclearly the upper melted and densified layer. As can be seen from Figure 8, as the depth from the melt \nlayer increases, then the amount of densification gradually decreases. The mere reordering of the \ncrystals that occurs at power densities below 0.9 kWcm-2 appears to have only a slight effect on the \ncontact angle, reducing it from 1180 to 1130. Nevertheless, such a reduction in the contact angle \nreveals that laser interaction without the incidence of melting does affect slightly the wettability \ncharacteristics of the AOC. \n \n \n4. Conclusion \nLaser surface melting of the AOC surface was necessary in order to allow the enamel to wet and \nadhere to the AOC surface. As such, the laser melting of the AOC surface resulted in the contact \nangle decreasing from 1180 to 330. Both the laser treatment of the AOC surface and the wettability \n 14 \nexperiments were conducted in normal atmospheric conditions. Wetting, and subsequent bonding, of \nthe enamel to the AOC surface after laser melting was identified as being due to: \na) The laser melting of the AOC surface reducing the surface roughness from an Ra value of  \n25.9 \u00b5m before laser melting, to 6.3 \u00b5m after laser melting, thus directly reducing the \ncontact angle \u03b8. \nb) The semi-empirically determined increase in the polar component of the surface energy \n\u03b3 sv\np\n, (2.0 to 16.2 mJ m-2) after laser melting as a result of the partial laser vitrification of \nthe glass forming elements within the AOC composition, thus improving the action of \nwetting and adhesion. \nc) The 36% increase in the surface oxygen content of the AOC resulting from laser     \nmelting was identified as further promoting the action of wetting. \nThis work demonstrates that it is possible to alter the wetting characteristics of the AOC using the \nHPDL to facilitate the firing of a vitreous enamel onto the AOC surface, a task not possible without \nlaser melting. Moreover, the findings of this work show that with the use of laser radiation it is a \ndistinct possibility that the wetting characteristics of many other materials could be altered. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to the EPSRC: Process Engineering Group (Grant \nNo. GR\/K99770), the EPSRC: CDP Group (CASE Award No. 95562556) and BNFL for their \nfinancial support.
