Mann (ian@aurora.york.ac.uk)\nand boundary layers; MHD waves and instabilities; solar\nwind-magnetosphere interactions)\n1 Introduction\nGlobal oscillations of magnetospheric field lines can be ex-\ncited in the magnetosphere by the solar wind. Dungey (1955)\nwas the first to consider the possibility that ultra-low fre-\nquency (ULF) waves might constitute Alfve\u00b4n waves which\nstand along geomagnetic field lines. Southwood (1974)\nand Chen and Hasegawa (1974) first considered how fast\nsurface waves, excited by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability\n(KHI) on the magnetopause, could drive standing Alfve\u00b4n\nfield line resonances (FLRs) on field lines of matching eigen-\nfrequency. Following the observations of Kivelson et al.\n(1984), Kivelson and Southwood (1985, 1986) solved the\nproblem of explaining the occurrence of discrete frequency\nFLRs by proposing that radially standing fast cavity mode\nwaves could be excited between the magnetopause and a\nturning point inside the magnetosphere. Their model pro-\nduced a discrete spectrum of cavity modes, each of which\nwould resonantly drive a monochromatic FLR. Later work\n(see e.g. Samson et al., 1992; Walker et al., 1992; Wright,\n1994) proposed that the outer magnetosphere might be bet-\nter modelled as an open waveguide, rather than a cavity. In\nthe waveguide model, discrete frequency wavegui de modes\ndrive FLRs as they propagate and disperse down the waveg-\nuide, Mann et al. (1998) having presented the first observa-\n406 I. R. Mann et al.: Global magnetospheric oscillations\ntional evidence for the existence and propagation of waveg-\nuide modes.\nIn recent theoretical work, Mann et al. (1999) showed\nhow, under conditions of sufficiently fast magnetosheath flow\nspeed, body type magnetospheric waveguide modes can be\ndriven by magnetopause KHI, in addition to the standard KH\nsurface waves (see also Mills et al., 1999). Interestingly, the\nMann et al. (1999) theory predicts that the conditions lo-\ncal to the magnetopause can control both the transport ULF\nwave power from the magnetosheath into the magnetosphere\nand the excitation of large amplitude FLRs. By examining\nthe azimuthal phase speed characteristics of multiple har-\nmonic FLRs, the Mann et al. (1999) theory can also be used\nto distinguish between FLRs driven by waveguide modes\nwhich result from solar wind impulses and those waveguide\nmodes which are excited by magnetopause KHI (see Mann\nand Wright, 1999; Mills and Wright, and Mathie and Mann,\n2000, for more details).\nTo test this theory requires ground-satellite conjugate stud-\nies which compare the global structure of the FLRs seen\non the ground with satellite measurements from close to\nthe magnetopause. In this paper we conduct co-ordinated\nground-based and Cluster observations of the global scale\nPc5 ULF waves which are excited on the magnetospheric\nflanks between 9 and 10 December 2000 during an inter-\nval of fast (> 600 kms\u22121) solar wind speed. Our observa-\ntions provide support for the hypotheiss that the KHI was\nresponsible for exciting the large amplitude pulsations ob-\nserved on the ground and for injecting significant energy into\nthe flank magnetosphere. Our observations also provide fur-\nther supporting evidence for the importance of ULF waves\nfor magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, in particular though\nthe generation of auroral currents and the modulation of elec-\ntron precipitation into the auroral ionosphere.\n2 Instrumentation\nWe present co-ordinated ground-based and Cluster observa-\ntions of ULF pulsations from 22:00 UT on 9 December (day\nof year 344) until 08:00 UT on 10 December 2000 (day of\nyear 345). During this interval the magnetosphere was sub-\nject to a steady fast solar wind speed stream, the level 2 ACE\ndata from the SWEPAM (McComas et al., 1998) instrument\n(not shown) showing that the solar wind speed remained in\nexcess of 600 km\/s, the solar wind dynamic pressure remain-\ning constant \u223c 2.5 nPa. Between approximately 22:00 UT\nand 02:00 UT, the Saskatoon SuperDARN radar (Greenwald\net al., 1995), and CANOPUS (Rostoker et al., 1995) magne-\ntometer and photometer data from the dusk local time sector\nshowed clear evidence of the excitation Pc5 FLRs.\nDuring December 2000, the Cluster spacecraft were still\nin the commissioning phase; however, data was being taken\nduring certain intervals. Between approximately 22:00 UT\nand 24:00 UT, Cluster was local-time conjugate to the Cana-\ndian sector on an outbound trajectory from the northern dusk\nflank lobe into the magnetosheath. Figure 1 shows the po-\nsitions of the CANOPUS stations (red dots in the Canadian\nsector) and the field of view of the Saskatoon SuperDARN\nradar in the Canadian sector. Filled dots indicate the mag-\nnetic footprint of the Cluster 1 satellite trajectory, traced with\nthe Tsyganenko 96 field model (Tsyganenko, 1996), plotted\nevery 5 min and colour coded to indicate the radial position\nof the spacecraft. Similarly, un-filled dots show the radial\nprojection of the trajectory of Cluster 1 and demonstrate the\nlocal time conjugacy of the Cluster satellites to the Canadian\nsector. The geographic pole is indicated with a cross; con-\ntours of geomagnetic latitude and longitude are plotted with\nincrements of 10 and 15 degrees, respectively.\nLater in this interval, from 01:30 UT until around\n08:00 UT (and later), the morning local time sector showed\nclear evidence from European ground instrumentation of\nlarge amplitude pulsations and field line resonances. The\nfield of view of the STARE Norway radar (belonging to\nthe MIRACLE instrument network, Syrja\u00a8suo et al., 1998),\nand the CUTLASS (Co-operative UK Twin Located Auroral\nSounding System) Hankasalmi, Finland (26.61\u25e6 E, 62.32\u25e6 N)\nSuperDARN radar, along with the positions of the IMAGE\n(Lu\u00a8hr et al., 1998) and SAMNET (Yeoman et al., 1990a)\nmagnetometer stations (red dots in the European sector) used\nin this study are also indicated on Fig. 1. The geographic and\nmagnetic coordinates of the CANOPUS and the IMAGE and\nSAMNET magnetometer stations are given in Tables 1 and 2\nrespectively. This configuration of ground-based instruments\non the dawn and dusk flank, combined with data local to the\ndusk magnetopause from Cluster, allow us to present a de-\ntailed analysis of the energisation of both the dawn and dusk\nflank magnetosphere (e.g. McDiarmid et al., 1994) by the\nsolar wind. The Cluster data allow us to test the hypothesis\nthat fluctuations close to the magnetopause, such as the KHI,\nmay have energised large amplitude pulsations and field line\nresonances on the flanks of the magnetosphere.\n3 Observations\n3.1 Ground-based dusk sector observations\nWe use Canadian sector ground-based data to identify and\ncharacterize a well-defined field line resonance and the as-\nsociated wave dynamics in the dusk sector. Pc5 wave activ-\nity is evident in CANOPUS magnetometer data in the hours\nbetween 22:00 UT on 9 December and 04:00 UT on 10 De-\ncember 2000. As we have supporting SuperDARN radar and\nCANOPUS photometer data, we focus on the latter part of\nthis interval. Figure 2 shows the H and D components of the\nmagnetic field measured by the CANOPUS magnetometer\nnetwork from 00:00\u201304:00 UT, the data having been rotated\nfrom geographic X and Y polarisation into CGM H and D\nmagnetic polarisation for the year 2000 epoch. Large am-\nplitude Pc5 ULF wave activity is clearly visible throughout\nthis interval in both theH andD components, with a particu-\nlarly prominent wave packet being observed between 00:00\u2013\n00:40 UT.

In Fig. 4, we show the results\nfrom a complex demodulation analysis (e.g. Beamish et al.,\n1979) of this dominant spectral peak. The technique of com-\nplex demodulation allows one to determine the amplitude\nand phase characteristics of a non-stationary time series by\ncomparison with a reference signal. Figure 4 shows the\nlatitudinal variation of the H and D component amplitude\n(first panel) and phase (second panel) for the CANOPUS\nChurchill line at the time of maximum H component am-\nplitude (6 min period demodulate, bandpass filtered between\n341 s and 381 s and analysed at 00:20 UT; see Mathie et al.\n(1999) for more details about applying the complex demod-\nulation technique to FLRs).\nFor the dominantly Alfve\u00b4nic signatures expected at a field\nline resonance, the magnetic perturbations in the magneto-\nsphere are rotated through 90\u25e6 upon transmission through\nthe ionosphere to the ground (e.g. Hughes and Southwood,\n1976). Consequently, a well-developed FLR with a dominant\ntoroidal polarisation in the magnetosphere would be rotated\ninto a wave dominated by the H -component on the ground,\nexactly as is seen in Fig. 4. The H -component shows the\nclear latitudinal amplitude maxima and 180\u25e6 phase change\nexpected for a well-developed field line resonance (see e.g.\nMathie et al., 1999). The D-component also shows an ampli-\ntude maximum, and similarly displays a large phase change\nacross the resonance.\nThe dominant wavepacket is best-defined in the H -\ncomponent for the stations FSM, GIL and RAB. Using\nthe maximum H -component demodulate from RAB and\nGIL gives a dimensionless azimuthal wavenumber m \u223c\n0.5 \u00b1 0.3 (the error, calculated from the CANOPUS sam-\npling rate, probably gives an upper bound; using an aver-\nage over the three maximum amplitude demodulates gives\nm \u223c 0.4 \u00b1 0.1, the error being the standard deviation). Us-\ning the D-component, away from the resonance, can min-\nimise any phase changes arising due to small latitudinal dis-\nplacements between longitudinally spaced stations. Using\nthe D-component station pair of ISL and MCM, away from\nthe resonance, gives m = +1.7 \u00b1 0.2 (the H -component\ngives m = +1.5 \u00b1 0.2). Despite the slight variability, all\nthese measurements are consistent with the expected east-\nward (tailward) propagation for dusk FLRs which are excited\nby waveguide modes driven by the solar wind. The low mag-\nnitude of m is consistent with previous observations of FLRs\nwhich were believed to have been driven by magnetospheric\nwaveguide modes (e.g. Fenrich et al., 1995; Mathie et al.,\n1999) and signifies that the waves are global scale magneto-\nspheric phenomena.\nIn Fig. 5 we show in more detail the latitudinal dynam-\nics of the pulsations along the Churchill line. The top panel\nshows a keogram of 557.7 nm data from the CANOPUS\nRankin Inlet meridian scanning photometer (MSP) while the\nbottom panel shows a stack plot of the X-component magne-\ntometer data from the six Churchill line magnetometer sta-\ntions (AACGM, e.g. Baker and Wing, 1989, invariant lati-\ntudes from 65\u25e6 to 80\u25e6), plotted on the same amplitude scale\nand band-pass filtered between 60 and 660 s. Both the mag-\nnetometer and MSP data show that Pc5 wave activity exists\non magnetic latitudes up to Rankin Inlet. More interestingly,\nthe phase of the X-component magnetic fields shows the\nclear polewards phase propagation which is expected for a\nI. R.

Hence, during the\ninterval 00:00\u201301:00 UT, the peak 557.7 nm emissions are\nlocated roughly 2\u25e6 equatorward of the polar cap boundary\n(between the latitudes of the ESK and RAN magnetometer\nstations). This is consistent with Figs. 2, 3 and 5 which show\nthat the highest latitude station TAL displays very little evi-\ndence of any clear ULF wave activity, consistent with its lo-\ncation on open field lines inside the polar cap. Moreover, the\n630 nm data suggest that the latitude of the resonance maps\ninto the central plasma sheet.\nIn Fig. 6 we show the ionospheric F-region plasma veloc-\nity as measured by beam 14 of the Saskatoon SuperDARN\nradar. Positive velocities correspond to motion towards the\nradar. As beam 14 of the radar passes over Fort Churchill (see\nFig. 1 of Voronkov et al. (1997) for a schematic of relative\npositions of the SuperDARN field of view over the Churchill\nLine stations), positive velocities are indicative of south-west\noriented plasma drifts. As can be seen in Fig. 6, there is a\nclear signature of a field line resonance in the radar data be-\ntween 00:00 UT and 00:30 UT. Furthermore, comparing ve-\nlocities measured in different beams, we can conclude that\nthe resonance is dominantly polarised with the flow velocity\nin the azimuthal direction. Based on the SuperDARN data,\nthe phase of the pulsations clearly increases with increasing\nlatitude, again consistent with the poleward phase propaga-\ntion seen in the X-component magnetometer data in Fig. 5.\nMagnetometer and radar data are further analysed in Fig. 7\nwhere the power spectral density of the X-component mag-\nnetic field from GIL, FCH, ESK, and RAN is shown in\npanel (a), and the power spectral density of plasma velocity\nfrom beam 14 of the Saskatoon radar is shown in panel (b).\nThe data have been pre-filtered with a Butter filter with a low\nfrequency cutoff at 0.5 mHz. The magnetometer data shows\nthat the frequency of the spectral peak at each station de-\ncreases with latitude, again, as expected for a driven field line\nresonance. For a driven resonance, the response on any given\nfield line will result from a combination of the fast mode driv-\ning frequency and the local natural Alfve\u00b4n frequency of the\nfield line (see e.g. ?, and references therein for a detailed dis-\ncussion)McDiarmid++99.

CANOPUS stacked H -component power spectra (filtered from 1\u201310 mHz) from 00:00 UT to 01:00 UT on 10 December 2000.\nfield line resonance will be increasingly dominated by the re-\nsponse at the local Alfve\u00b4n resonant eigenfrequency. This will\nresult in phase mixing across the FLR (see e.g. Mann et al.,\n1995). The increase of wave period with latitude, character-\nistic of phase mixing, is the most expected and important fea-\nture of a well-developed field line resonance and is a direct\nconsequence of an Earthward gradient of the Alfve\u00b4n velocity\nin the magnetosphere outside the plasmapause. In panel (b),\nit can be clearly seen that the spectral distribution of the con-\nvection pulsations measured by the radar is close to the spec-\ntrum of magnetic pulsations registered by the Fort Churchill\nmagnetometer, confirming that both instruments are measur-\ning the same wave at the same location.\nObservations of the field line resonance above are in very\ngood agreement with theoretical expectations such as those\npresented Samson et al. (1998) which can be summarized\nas follows. At one phase of the resonance, the upward field\naligned current (FAC) sheet is at the equatorward border of\nthe resonance region. This FAC moves poleward, consis-\ntent with the latitudinal phase shift (c.f. Wright and Allan,\n1996a and Mann, 1997). In the low-m field line resonance,\nthe upward FAC is mostly closed by a near-longitudinally\ndirected Pedersen current. This in turn corresponds to an\nEastward Hall current equatorward of the upward FAC sheet.\nThe maxima of the Eastward Hall current occurs at the same\ntime as the peak of the westward plasma convection flow.\nIn Fig. 8, we combine the time dependence of the mag-\nnetic X-component Fort Churchill (normalized by 100 nT)\nand plasma velocities measured using beam 14 right above\nFort Churchill. As seen from Fig. 8, these independent\ninstruments show excellent agreement with both the mag-\nnetic and velocity measurements showing the same period\nand wavepacket structure.

As can be clearly seen, Cluster enters the magne-\ntosheath boundary layer from the magnetosphere at 22:10 UT\n(first dotted red line, marked as BL). At 23:40 UT, Clus-\nter crosses the magnetopause and enters the magnetosheath\nproper (second dotted red line, marked as MP). Between\nthese times, Cluster travels deeper into the magnetosheath\nboundary layer, the magnetic field gradually decreasing from\nmagnetospheric values (before 22:10 UT) towards the lower\nmagnetosheath magnetic fields seen at the end of the interval\n(after 23:40 UT).\nIn Fig. 11 we show the results from a minimum vari-\nance analysis (Sonnerup and Cahill, 1967) of the magne-\ntopause crossing around 23:40 UT which shows significant\nshear across the boundary. The top panel shows, after Dun-\nlop et al. (1999), a scatter plot (pink crosses) of the mag-\nnetic field angles (\u03b8 and \u03c6 GSE) measured by FGM on Clus-\nter 2 between 23:34\u201323:48 UT. For a tangential discontinu-\nity (TD) crossing, the field direction through the boundary\nshould lie nearly on a plane (since B.n = 0). The green\ncurve represents a planar fit to the data points, indicating\nthe field directions which would be expected if the mag-\nnetic field vectors during this magnetopause crossing lay in\na plane. The red curve shows the locus of the plane which\nresults from a minimum variance analysis (MVA) between\nthese times, the minimum variance plane having a normal\nvector nMVA = (0.63, 0.49, 0.60) (GSE). The normal di-\nrection is stable and has an eigenvalue ratio in excess of 10.\nThere is excellent agreement between the fit to the observed\ndata and the results from the minimum variance analysis in-\ndicating that the magnetopause was a fairly clean tangential\ndiscontinuity.\nInterestingly, MVA analysis applied to Cluster 1 and Clus-\nter 3 in the same interval produces normals which point\nin the same direction as Cluster 2 (Cluster 1 nMVA =\n[0.64, 0.50, 0.59]; Cluster 3 nMVA = [0.64, 0.51, 0.58]).\nCluster 4 produces a slightly different normal, tilting slightly\n\u221210 \u22128 \u22126 \u22124 \u22122 0 2 4 6 8 10\n\u22125\n0\n5\n10\n15\nY \nR\ne\nX Re\n22:00 UT \nMP @ ZGSM = 10 RE \nP\nram\n = 3 nPa \nnMP = (0.51, 0.63, 0.59) \nFig. 9.

Also indicated is\nthe GSE vector direction of the model magnetopause normal (nMP)\nat the position where the Cluster trajectory crosses the model mag-\nnetopause.\nin the Z direction which may indicate some magnetopause\ncompression (nMVA = [0.73, 0.50, 0.47]). However, in\ngeneral, the normals from the MVA point approximately in\nthe direction of the expected model MP normal direction\n(see Fig. 9). Consequently, the magnetopause crossing at\n23:40 UT is consistent with the advection of a magnetopause\nwhich is planar on the scale of the Cluster spacecraft sep-\naration. Note, however, that the MVA determined normals\npoint a little more sunwards than the direction predicted by\nthe MP model. Interestingly, as pointed out by Otto and Fair-\nfield (2000) (see also Fairfield et al., 2000, and references\ntherein), if the magnetopause normal were being distorted\nslightly by the KHI, then for crossings from the magneto-\nsphere into the magnetosheath (at the trailing edge), the mag-\nnetopause (MVA) normal would be expected to point slightly\nsunwards of the model MP normal, exactly as observed here.\nThe bottom panel of Fig. 11 shows the angle of the mag-\nnetic field out of the plane of the MVA normal, \u03b8bn. It can\nbe clearly seen that \u03b8bn is close to zero for the magnetopause\ncrossing around 23:40 UT, as would be expected for a TD.\nInterestingly, the magnetic geometry of the entry of Cluster\ninto the magnetosheath boundary layer around 22:10 UT is\nalso well characterised by \u03b8bn angles which are close to zero.\nThis suggests that the structure of the edge of the boundary\nlayer was also planar, being aligned with a normal direction\nclose to that of the magnetopause crossing at 23:40 UT. Un-\nfortunately, this cannot be verified with a MVA since the en-\ntry into the magnetosheath boundary layer is characterised\nby low magnetic shear.\nAs Cluster enters the boundary layer, a number of interest-\nI. R. Mann et al.: Global magnetospheric oscillations 413\ning structures are revealed. Figure 12 shows the FGM mag-\nnetic field magnitude from the four Cluster spacecraft in the\ninterval 22:00 to 24:00 UT. The first three panels show the\ndata between 22:00\u201322:20 UT, 22:20\u201322:40 UT and 22:40\u2013\n23:00 UT, whilst the fourth panel summarises the Cluster\nFGM observations in the interval 22:00\u201324:00 UT. Again,\nthe entry into the boundary later at 22:10 UT and the magne-\ntopause crossing around 23:40 UT are both clearly seen. Fol-\nlowing the entry into the boundary layer (BL) at 22:10 UT,\nthe Cluster spacecraft measure magnetic field variations with\nshort correlation lengths; different spacecraft measuring dif-\nferent field fluctuations. In agreement with the single space-\ncraft data shown in Fig. 10, there is a transition into a\nless turbulent and more magnetosphere-like region within\nthe BL (with longer correlation lengths) between 23:18 and\n23:40 UT, perhaps as a result of outwards motion of the\nmagnetopause and boundary layer moving Cluster closer\nto the magnetosphere. After the magnetopause crossing at\n23:40 UT, the correlation between individual Cluster space-\ncraft is again reduced, consistent with the Cluster spacecraft\nmoving into the magnetosheath proper.\nThe fourth panel of Fig. 12 also highlights three particu-\nlar regions of interest, each of which are magnified in pan-\nels one, two and three. In the first panel, all four Cluster\nspacecraft see effectively the same magnetic field as they\ntravel through the outer lobe towards the magnetopause un-\ntil around 22:10 UT. At this time, the four Cluster spacecraft\nenter the magnetosheath boundary layer (BL), each space-\ncraft entering the lower field magnitude region in the bound-\nary layer at slightly different times. Spacecraft two (red) en-\nters the BL first, with spacecraft one and three (black and\ngreen) crossing the BL next, followed by Cluster four (ma-\ngenta). Looking again at the Cluster orbit configuration plot\nin Fig. 9, the ordering of the spacecraft entries into the BL\ncan be understood on the basis of the orientation of the space-\ncraft with respect to the expected model magnetopause ori-\nentation. Figure 9 shows that in the X \u2212 Y plane, Cluster 2\n(red) is situated at highest GSE X position, and would be ex-\npected to enter the BL first at this local time. Subsequent MP\ncrossing would then be expected by Cluster 3, followed by\nCluster 1 and 4. However, Cluster 1, 3 and 4 do not lie at\nthe GSE Z position. In the northern lobe, the magnetopause\nwill be inclined towards higher Z at lower Y . Based on the\nCluster orientation in the YZ plane, where Cluster 4 lies at\nthe lowest position in Y and Z, we would expect Cluster 1\nand 3 to cross the MP before Cluster 4, exactly as observed.\nGiven that the low shear entry into the BL at 22:10 UT\nis characterised by MVA field angles \u03b8bn which are close to\nzero, the ordering of the spacecraft entries into the BL is also\nconsistent with the hypothesis that the MVA normal from\nthe 23:40 UT MP crossing also characterises the (presumably\nplanar) geometry of the edge of the magnetosheath bound-\nary layer. Hence we can conclude that the entry of Cluster\ninto the magnetosheath BL at 22:10 UT can be explained by\nthe motion of the edge of the locally planar BL across the\nspacecraft, whose normal lies close to the expected model\nmagnetopause direction.\nExamining the structure of the magnetosheath boundary\nlayer between 22:10 UT and 23:00 UT shows that there are\nnumber of excursions of the Cluster spacecraft into regions\ncharacterised by low |B|. Some of the entries into regions\nof lower magnetic field magnitude are observed by the Clus-\nter spacecraft in the same sequence as that observed at the\n22:10 UT entry into the magnetosheath BL (and that of the\n23:40 UT magnetopause crossing) consistent with the advec-\ntive motion of large scale approximately planar structures in\nthe magnetosheath boundary layer across the spacecraft. For\nexample, examining both Figs. 10 and 12, it is clear that, fol-\nlowing entry into the BL at 22:10 UT, Cluster enters a low\n|B| region, the individual Cluster spacecraft maintaining ap-\nproximately the same entry sequence as for the BL cross-\ning at 22:10 UT before reaching the minima in |B| at around\n22:13\u201322:14 UT. The subsequent motion back into a region\nof higher |B| broadly shows the reverse spacecraft ordering,\nalthough the signatures appear to be more complex. Other\nclear examples of entries into regions of low |B| with the\nsame ordering can be seen beginning at around 22:23 UT,\n22:36:30 UT, 22:43:30 UT and 22:49 UT, the minima in |B|\nobserved by Cluster 3 being marked by green solid vertical\nlines in Fig. 10.\nWe believe that these regions of low |B| are observed by\nCluster as a result of the advection of the magnetosheath\nboundary layer across the spacecraft, resulting in the sam-\npling of regions of lower magnetic field which lie closer\nto the magnetopause, although probably not resulting in the\ncrossing of the magnetopause itself. Examining the entries of\nthe Cluster satellites into regions of low |B| in the boundary\nlayer appears to suggest a possible 6\u20137 min quasiperiodic se-\nquence. There are minima in |B| around 22:13 UT, 22:24 UT,\n22:31 UT, 22:38 UT, 22:44 UT and 22:56 UT (cf the green\nsolid vertical lines in Fig. 10). As shown in Fig. 10, the de-\ncrease in |B| is, in general, related to a decrease in magni-\ntude of both BX and BY . There is also some evidence that\nthis quasi-periodic series may continue with |B| and BX de-\ncreases also being observed around 23:02 UT, 23:08 UT and\n23:16 UT. Interestingly, during the regions of low |B|, there\nis the suggestion from the bottom panel of Fig. 11 that these\nmay also be accompanied by rotations of the MVA angle \u03b8bn\nclose to zero. This may be suggestive of motion of the Clus-\nter satellites closer to the magnetopause within the BL.\nThe 6\u20137 min quasiperiodic sequence of entries into regions\nof low |B| between 22:13 UT and 22:56 UT does, however,\nappear to be interrupted by |B| dips missing at times around\n22:18 UT and 22:50 UT. Interestingly, as shown in the four\nspacecraft data from Fig. 12, at 22:18 UT there is evidence\nof a classic nested partial entry into a region of lower |B|.\nHere, Cluster 4 does not enter the low |B| region, whilst\nCluster 1 and 3 appear partially to enter a lower |B| region;\nCluster 2 enters furthest into the low |B| region. This would\nbe consistent with smaller amplitude inward motion of the\nmagnetosheath boundary layer and hence only a partial en-\ntry of the Cluster quartet into a region of lower |B|. This\nmight be expected immediately following entry into the BL\nwhen the spacecraft remain close to the magnetosphere and\n414 I. R.

Similarly, at 22:49 UT there is evidence of\nsequential Cluster satellite motion into a slightly lower |B|\nregion with the same ordering as the 22:10 UT entry into the\nBL. After 22:49 UT, as with the other entries into regions\nof low |B| in the quasi-periodic sequence, a clear decrease\nin BX is observed. However, in this case |B| does not de-\ncrease to such a low magnitude as that seen in the adjacent\n|B| dips around 22:44 UT and 22:56 UT. This may be in part\nbecause the change in BX is partially offset by an increase in\nBZ . Consequently, the observations from both 22:18 UT and\n22:49 UT can still be interpretted as being supportive of fill-\ning in the missing entries in the hypothesised 6\u20137 min quasi-\nperiodic sequence.\nThis quasi-periodic motion of the magnetpause and\nboundary layers is consistent with that expected for a global\nmode of the magnetosphere, this global mode perhaps being\nexcited by the development of the KHI on the dusk flank.\nFor this explanation to be correct the KHI is required to\nhave a wavelength which is much longer than both the Clus-\nter spacecraft separation and the oscillatory displacement of\nthe magnetopause, so that the local orientation of the mag-\nnetopause and boundary layer is approximately the same at\neach spacecraft and relatively close to the expected model\nMP orientation.

Mann et al.: Global magnetospheric oscillations\nmagnetosphere into the magnetosheath, the KH would be ex-\npected to rotate the normal to point slightly sunwards of the\nmodel MP normal (cf. Fairfield et al., 2000); we discuss this\nfurther below.\nThere are also some partial entries of the Cluster\nspacecraft into lower |B| regions which do not fit the\nquasi-periodic sequence, such as that seen by Cluster 1\nat 22:28:30 UT or the partially nested structure seen at\n22:41:30 UT. However, these two cases may be the result\nof motion of the magnetopause due to changes in upstream\nram pressure or result from local scale structures in the mag-\nnetosheath, rather than the development of long down-tail\nwavelength KHI. Indeed, both of these cases appear to repre-\nsent situations where the Cluster satellites sample smaller |B|\nexcursions than those adjacent |B| dips which do fit with the\nquasi-periodic sequence. Moreover, the observations from\n22:28:30 UT show a case where Cluster 1 clearly samples\nthe lowest |B| of all four Cluster satellites. Since Clus-\nter 1 lies at the highest Z, this is consistent with the mag-\nnetopause and boundary layer moving towards lower Z and\nflattening the magnetosphere and magnetosheath compared\nto both the model magnetopause shape and the normals in-\nferred from the 22:10 UT and 23:40 UT BL and MP cross-\nings. This would leave Cluster 1 sampling lower |B| as it\n\u201cpokes out\u201d further into the boundary layer as compared to\nthe other Cluster satellites and could be consistent with dis-\ntortion of the magnetopause and boundary layer on smaller\nspatial scales.\nIf the Cluster spacecraft are seeing periodic entries into\nlow |B| regions as a result of the periodic motion of an ap-\nproximately planar magnetosheath boundary layer and mag-\nnetopause, due to the action of the KHI, one might expect\nthat there would be similar quasi-periodic entries into re-\ngions of higher |B| at the maxima of the outwards motion\nof the magnetopause. There are examples of transitions with\nexactly the reverse ordering to that observed for the BL en-\ntry at 22:10 UT (Cluster 4, then Cluster 1,3, and then Clus-\nter 2), presumably as a result of the global outwards mo-\ntion of the magnetopause and boundary layer. Indeed, as\nmentioned above, following the |B| dip at 22:13 UT there\nis clear outward motion with the expected ordering begin-\nning at 22:14 UT. Similarly, the nested signature at 22:18 UT\nsuggests clear inward then outward motion of the bound-\nary layer. In a similar fashion, there is evidence of outward\nmotion around 22:24:30 UT (following the inward motion at\n22:23 UT); mid-way between the |B| dip at 22:31 UT and\nthat at 22:38 UT there is another example of outward motion\nbeginning at 22:34 UT. However, in this latter instance, the\nordering of Cluster 1 and 2 is reversed from that expected\nfor the motion of a planar boundary aligned with the mag-\nnetopause. This motion is immediately followed by what\nappears to be inward motion at 22:35 UT, where the Clus-\nter spacecraft measurements are again ordered by the ex-\npected MP orientation. In general, the spacecraft ordering\nfor outward motion of the boundary layer appears to be much\nmore complicated than that for the inward motion. Often, for\nthe outward motion of the boundary layer, the ordering seen\nby Cluster does not match that expected from the outward\nmotion of planar structures whose orientation is determined\nby model magnetopause orientation. This suggests that the\norientation of the magnetopause and magnetosheath bound-\nary layer may differ between inbound and outbound motion.\nThis could be explained by the development of KH vortex\nstructures on the MP and in the BL; we discuss this further\nbelow.\nIn general the Cluster observations are consistent with\nquasi-periodic inward and outward motion of the magne-\ntopause and magnetosheath boundary layer across the Clus-\nter quartet. This quasi-periodic motion is what would be ex-\npected from a global magnetospheric oscillation such as a\nmagnetospheric waveguide mode. Indeed, since the periodic\nmagnetosheath motion has the same period as the ULF waves\non the ground in Canadian sector, LT conjugate to Cluster\n(see Fig. 1), there is the strong suggestion that the motion of\nthe magnetopause may have been related to driving the FLRs\nseen on the ground. It is possible that the development of a\nlong wavelength KHI on the dusk flank caused the periodic\nglobal motion of the magnetosheath boundary layer across\nthe Cluster quartet and that this KHI was the energy source\nfor the large amplitude ULF waves seen on the ground. It\nshould be noted, however, that any global compressional os-\ncillations of the magnetosphere would be expected to cause\ninward and outward motion of the magnetopause. We dis-\ncuss the possible solar wind energy sources for these global\noscillations further below.\n3.3 Ground-based dawn sector observations\nDuring the interval 00:00\u201308:00 UT, on 10 December 2000\n(DOY 345), ground-based instrumentation in the European\nsector also observed very large amplitude ULF waves as the\nEarth\u2019s rotation moved it into the dawn flank. Figure 13\nshows the unfilteredH (a) andD (b) component magnetome-\nter data from selected stations of the IMAGE and SAMNET\nmagnetometer arrays (see Fig. 1 and Table 2 for details of\nthe station locations). As can be clearly seen, very large\namplitude ULF waves are prevalent throughout this inter-\nval across the whole European sector, with particularly clear\nwave packets between 00:45\u201302:00 UT, 03:30\u201304:00 UT and\n04:45\u201306:10 UT.\nFigure 14 shows the stacked H -component power spec-\ntrum, filtered between 100 s and 600 s, for these IMAGE and\nSAMNET magnetometer stations between 00:45\u201302:15 UT.\nA sharp spectral peak, whose frequency is independent of\nlatitude, can be seen at around 3.2 mHz, with a smaller sub-\nsidiary latitude independent peak at around 4.5 mHz (this lat-\nter peak being less clear on the more westerly SAMNET sta-\ntions during this interval).\nIn Fig. 15 we show the results from a complex demod-\nulation analysis of the 3.2 mHz spectral component from a\nlatitudinal chain of selected magnetometer stations from the\nIMAGE array (bandpassed between 3.0 mHz and 3.3 mHz\nand taking an average of the two maximum H amplitude de-\nmodulates from around 01:50 UT).

Stacked H -component power\nspectra for the selected SAMNET and\nIMAGE magnetometer stations shown\nin Fig 14. Each power spectra is inde-\npendently scaled.\nseen by CANOPUS on the dusk flank, the IMAGE mag-\nnetometers show these dawn flank waves to be dominanted\nby the H -component on the ground as expected for a domi-\nnantly toroidal wave in the magnetosphere. Again, the FLR\ncharacteristic is verified by the 180\u25e6 latitudinal phase change\nseen in the H -component. For this wave packet, the D-\ncomponent also shows a latitudinal peak; however, there is\na smaller phase change across the array in this component.\nWe can also estimate the azimuthal wavenumber of the\nwaves by examining the phase changes at the longitudes lo-\ncal to the latitudinal chain of magnetometer stations shown\nin Fig. 15. Examining the phases from the complex demod-\nulation analysis from Fig. 15 and using the D-component to\nminimise latitudinal phase changes, results in an m-value of\n\u223c \u22128.0 \u00b1 1.4 from stations PEL and SOD. Closer to the\nresonance, the longitudinal chain KIL-MAS-KEV produces\nmore variable phase estimates; however they are consistent\nwith westward phase propagation with m <\u223c 10.\nThe clear ULF wave activity, seen by the IMAGE and\nSAMNET magnetometers, was also observed by the STARE\nVHF radar in the European sector. Figure 16 shows the\nradar back scatter power (top panel) and flow velocity (bot-\ntom panel) from beam 2 of the STARE Norway radar be-\ntween 00:00 UT and 06:00 UT on 9 December 2000. In the\nbackscatter power returns, very clear wave activity in the\nPc5 band can be seen between 01:30\u201302:00 UT and between\n03:30\u201304:00 UT, with smaller amplitude activity being ob-\nserved throughout the interval from 00:30\u201304:00 UT. The\nwave activity is seen clearly in both the backscatter power\nand velocities between around 67 and 70 degrees geomag-\nnetic, with evidence of the polewards phase propagation ex-\npected for a low-m FLR (e.g. Wright and Allan, 1996a).\nTo examine the wave characteristics in more detail, we\nshow in the top panel of Fig. 17 the backscatter power from\nselected range gates from beam 2. In this plot, very clear\nsinusoidal backscatter power oscillations are apparent, par-\n418 I. R. Mann et al.: Global magnetospheric oscillations\nFig. 15.

The\nsecond panel in Fig. 17 shows the velocities seen by the CUT-\nLASS Hankasalmi radar beam 5, close to the location of the\nSTARE backscatter power returns.\nAt the beginning (before 00:30 UT) and end (after\n04:00 UT) of the interval shown in Fig. 16 there is no STARE\nradar backscatter, due to a lack of scattering irregularities\nresulting from the low ambient electric field (see e.g. Wal-\ndock et al., 1985). The VHF radar backscatter, seen by the\nSTARE system in the centre of the interval, corresponds to\nan interval of enhanced ionospheric convection, as can be\nseen from the north-western pointing beam of the CUTLASS\nHankasalmi radar in the bottom panel of Fig. 17 (see also\nGreenwald et al., 1995). The enhanced electric fields will\nproduce backscatter through the two-stream instability (see\ne.g. Fejer and Kelly, 1980). The observed phase velocity\nof such backscatter is not a direct measurement of the line\nof sight component of the E \u00d7 B velocity but is limited\nto the acoustic speed of the E-region ionosphere, although\nthis itself increases non-linearly with the E \u00d7 B velocity\n(Robinson, 1986). The enhanced convection electric field is\nthen modulated by the ULF wave electric field, such that in-\ncomplete data coverage is available throughout the wave cy-\ncle, complicating any analysis of the wave (Yeoman et al.,\n1992). However the observed Doppler velocities are unidi-\nrectional and the backscatter intensity, which itself increases\nwith E \u00d7 B velocity, will thus provide a good proxy for the\nULF wave amplitude (see Yeoman et al., 1990b; Shand et al.,\n1996).\nTo examine the properties of the ULF waves seen by\nSTARE, Fig. 18 shows the unfiltered power spectrum of\nthe backscatter power from beam 2, range gate 38, between\n01:30\u201302:00 UT. A clear broad spectral peak, centred on\n2.7 mHz, can be seen, in good agreement with the magne-\ntometer observations presented in Fig. 14. In Fig. 19 we\nshow the latitudinal amplitude and phase variation of the\n2.7 mHz component from STARE beam 2 for range gates\n28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 (cf., the top panel of Fig. 17). A\nclear latitudinal amplitude maximum, at around 68.7\u25e6 geo-\nmagnetic, is seen with a phase change of around 50\u25e6 between\n67.8 and 69.1\u25e6.\nClearly, there is excellent agreement between the wave ac-\ntivity seen by STARE and by the magnetometers. Both see\na clear ULF wave with frequency close to 3.2 mHz (note\nthat the STARE radar spectrum in Fig. 18 has limited fre-\nquency resolution due to the analysis of only 30 min of data).\nThe STARE data shows that the power in spectral peak at\n2.7 mHz demonstrates both the amplitude maxima and phase\nchange expected from a FLR. Comparing Figs. 19 and 15,\nwe see that the STARE inferred resonant latitude lies in the\ngap of magnetometer coverage between MAS and BJN (66\u2013\n71\u25e6 geomagnetic). The resonant latitudes inferred from the\nIMAGE and STARE data appear to be entirely consistent\nwith the limited latitudinal extent of the STARE backscat-\nter, revealing part of the expected 180\u25e6 phase change which\nis seen over a wider latitudinal range by the magnetometers.\nPrevious observations of Pc5 ULF waves have also placed\nthe resonant field line of waves around 3 mHz frequency be-\ntween the Scandinavian mainland and BJN station (c.f., the\n2.6 and 3.7 mHz FLRs presented in Fig. 8 of Mathie and\nMann, 2000).\nWe can also estimate the azimuthal wavenumber of the\nwaves using the STARE observations in this interval. Since\nthe STARE radar measures variations along the radar line of\nsight, calculating the m-values with STARE requires a care-\nful consideration of the geometry of the differing look direc-\ntions from beam to beam, which can influence the inferred\nm-values especially if the waves are not linearly polarised.\nLow-m FLRs are, in general, elliptically polarised at reso-\nnance and this can cause the radar beam geometry to influ-\nence radar inferred m (see e.g. Ziesolleck et al., 1998). The\nSTARE data in the interval 01:30\u201302:00 UT suggest west-\nwards phase propagation with an m-value \u223c 4. This is con-\nsistent with the magnetometer estimates and, with a FLR be-\ning driven by a tailwards propagating source such as a mag-\nnetospheric waveguide mode, in the morning local-time sec-\ntor. Moreover, this suggests that the STARE latitudinal phase\nprofile shown in Fig. 19 is not significantly contaminated by\nthe 3\u25e6 of longitude covered by the latitudinal range.\nReturning to Fig. 13, we can see that large amplitude ULF\nwave activity continues thoughout the morning sector. Sev-\neral other large amplitude wavepackets are apparent in both\nthe H - and D-components, the H -component being dom-\ninant in each wavepacket with the two wave packets be-\ntween 03:30\u201304:00 UT and 04:45\u201306:10 UT being particu-\nlarly clear. Amplitude and phase analysis of the 03:30\u2013\n04:00 UT wave packet show that there is a clear spectral peak\nat around 2.5 mHz however, the behaviour of the amplitude\nand phase at this frequency during this interval is compli-\ncated by the large amplitude impulsive signature at around\n03:52 UT. This feature is clearly related to a poleward mov-\ning arc seen by the all-sky-cameras (ASC) of the MIRACLE\nnetwork (not shown). The ASC camera, the magnetometer,\nI. R.

Consequently, it is difficult to de-\ntermine whether this arc is related to the pulsation activity\nwhich exists throughout the 03:30\u201304:00 UT interval or is\ndriven by a separate propagating field aligned current (FAC)\nsystem which crosses the MIRACLE network at the same\ntime. The wavepacket between 04:45\u201306:10 UT seems to\nrepresent a more continous wavetrain and can be seen to con-\ntain a number of discrete spectral components. Figure 20\nshows the unfiltered H -component power spectrum between\n04:30\u201305:45 UT; clear latitude-independent discrete spectral\npeaks are apparent at around 1.9, 2.7, 3.7, and 4.6 mHz. Lati-\ntudinal amplitude maxima and phase changes consistent with\nthe excitation of FLRs are seen for each spectral compo-\nnent (not shown). Figure 21 shows the frequencies and the\ncorresponding modulus of the m-values for the wavepack-\nets seen in Fig. 13 for the two discrete frequencies seen\nbetween 01:30\u201302:00 UT (cf. Fig. 14) and the four dis-\ncrete frequencies seen between 04:45\u201306:10 UT (cf Fig. 20).\nm-values were calculated using the D-component from the\nSOD-PEL station pair, to minimise the effects of latitudinal\nphase changes which dominate near the resonance and have\nmore influence in the H - rather than the D-component. The\nm-values, shown in Fig. 21, were all measured to be nega-\ntive (westward) consistent with tailward phase propagation\nin the morning sector; however, the figure shows the mod-\nulus of m for clarity. The frequency components from the\nearlier wave packet are marked with an x-symbol in Fig. 21,\nthe error bars in frequency and m-value are calculated on the\nbasis of the bandwidth of the complex demodulation analy-\nsis used to isolate each spectral component and the standard\ndeviation in the m-value estimates taken over the maximum\nH -component amplitude demodulates, respectively. Both\nwavepackets suggest that there might be an almost linear re-\nlationship between frequency and m-value; the dot-dashed\nlines show an approximate best-fit line through the origin\nand the data points. Hence, we can estimate the azimuthal\nphase speed of these wavepackets in the ionosphere, using\nthe relationship vphI = 2piRE cos3f\/m where RE is the\nEarths radius, 3 is the latitude of the observation and f is\nthe wave frequency.

Recent theoretical work by Mann\net al. (1999) (see also Mills et al., 1999) has shown that the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability can excite body type waveg-\nuide modes, in addition to the standard KH surface waves.\nLater work by Mills and Wright (1999) and Mann and Wright\n(1999) (see also Wright and Rickard, 1995) has shown that\nmultiple FLRs excited by several radial waveguide mode har-\nmonics will be expected to possess the same azimuthal phase\nspeed. Observational evidence (e.g. Mathie and Mann, 2000)\nhas now placed this hypothesis on a firmer footing by show-\nI. R.

Clear latitude independent\nspectral peaks are apparent at around\n1.9, 2.7, 3.7 and 4.6 mHz.\ning clearly how common azimuthal phase speed FLRs can\nbe driven during fast solar wind speed intervals. According\nto the theory of Mann et al. (1999), body waveguide modes\n(in addition to the usual surface modes) can be energised by\nthe KHI once the magnetosheath flow speed exceeds a crit-\nical speed \u223c 500 kms\u22121 (the exact critical speed depends\nupon variations in the sound and Alfve\u00b4n speeds and the mag-\nnetic field across the magnetopause). The theory is in excel-\nlent agreement with the observations of Engebretson et al.\n(1998) (see also Mathie and Mann, 2001) who showed that\nULF wave power in the morning side increases significantly\nwhen the solar wind speed >\u223c 500 kms\u22121. Statistical stud-\nies of the diurnal variation of Pc5 ULF wave power show\nthat it is strongly peaked in the morning local time sector.\nAs discussed by Mann and Wright (1999), stabilising IMF\nmagnetic field tension in the dusk local time sector is usually\ncited as a likely reason for the dawn-dusk flank asymmetry\n(see Lee and Olson, 1980). Further, and as shown by Mann\net al. (1999), the KHI acts through the propagation of distur-\nbances against the background flow. In the magnetospheric\nframe, the down-tail phase speed of waves driven by the KHI\nonly occurs because they are advected downstream by the\nflow. This should result in azimuthal phase speeds, vph, for\nKH driven FLRs which are < U .\nIn the observations we have presented here, there is clear\nobservational evidence for the excitation of large amplitude\nPc5 FLRs on both the dawn and dusk flanks during an in-\nterval of fast solar wind speed. Figure 21 shows that the\nmultiple frequency FLRs observed on the dawn flank in the\nintervals between 01:30\u201302:00 UT and 04:45\u201306:10 UT had\ncommon ionospheric azimuthal phase speeds of 6.7 kms\u22121\nand 12.0 kms\u22121, respectively. Assuming an equatorial mag-\nnetopause standoff distance of 10RE , produces estimates of\nthe magnetopause phase speeds of around 170 kms\u22121 and\n300 kms\u22121, respectively. These phase speeds are likely to\nbe less than U at the local times of the measurements, espe-\n422 I. R. Mann et al.: Global magnetospheric oscillations\nFig. 21.

Dot-dashed lines represent lines of approximate best fit\nthrough the origin in each case. See text for more details.\ncially given that on the flanks the magnetosheath speed ap-\nproaches the upstream solar wind speed (e.g. Spreiter and\nStahara, 1980). Consequently, the low, common azimuthal\nphase speed property of the FLRs on the dawn flank pro-\nvides excellent evidence that the KHI was responsible for\nenergising waveguide modes which themselves drive large\namplitude FLRs on the dawn flank (cf. Mann and Wright,\n1999).\nOn the dusk flank, however, multiple frequency FLRs\nwere not recorded in the interval studied (between 00:00\u2013\n00:40 UT). Using the m-value estimated from the D-\ncomponent at the ISL and MCM stations (3 \u2248 64.5\u25e6), for\na 6 min period wave, results in a significantly faster iono-\nspheric azimuthal phase speed of around 28 kms\u22121. Map-\nping this speed to a model magnetopause at 10RE produces a\nmagnetopause phase speed \u223c 650 kms\u22121, very similar to the\nupstream solar wind speed. As discussed above, the fastest\ngrowing KHI driven modes will, in general, be expected to\ndrive FLRs with phase speeds somewhat lower than the local\nsheath speed (see e.g. Mills and Wright, 1999, their Fig. 11);\nhowever, more slowly growing modes might be excited with\nspeeds closer to U . Hence, on the basis of the phase speed,\nwe cannot unambigously determine whether the dusk flank\nFLR was driven by a KH unstable waveguide mode. In-\ndeed, according to Mann and Wright (1999), a phase speed\nvph \u223c U may be more suggestive of a magnetopause running\npulse driver than the development of the KHI.\nVery recently, Sarafopoulos et al. (2001) have presented\nground-based magnetometer observations of large amplitude\nULF waves on both the dawn and dusk flanks during an\ninterval of fast solar wind speed. They also proposed the\nKHI as the mechanism which energised the pulsations. De-\nspite having no in situ measurements local to the magne-\ntopause, Sarafopoulos et al. (2001) observed periodic vari-\nations in the > 38 keV electron channel on Geotail in the\nmagnetosheath. These authors argued that magnetopause\nmotion provided a periodic magnetic connectivity between\nGeotail and the oscillating magnetopause. The electron sig-\nnatures occurred during intervals of magnetic connectivity to\nthe magnetopause, providing a remote signature of periodic\nmagnetopause oscillations on the dawn flank.\nIn this study, we are fortunate to have in-situ Cluster data\nfrom the dusk flank which can be used to examine the mo-\ntion and orientation of the magnetopause and boundary lay-\ners. The Cluster data can be used to test the hypothesis\nthat the ground pulsations are related to global waveguide\nmodes with corresponding periodic magnetopause motion,\nperhaps due to the excitation of the KHI. During the interval\nimmediately preceding the observations of the largest am-\nplitude ULF waves on the ground in the Canadian sector\n(00:00\u201300:40 UT), the Cluster satellites were following an\noutbound trajectory through the high latitude dusk lobe and\ninto the magnetosheath, crossing the MP at 23:40 UT. Fol-\nlowing the entry into the magnetosheath BL, at 22:10 UT,\nCluster repeatedly and quasi-periodically sampled regions\nof low |B| in the magnetosheath boundary layer (BL) be-\ntween 22:24\u201322:56 UT (and possibly longer until around\n23:16 UT). While the location of the Cluster quartet in rela-\ntion to the equilibrium position of the magnetopause was not\nsuch that motion of the magnetopause and BL caused Clus-\nter to repeatedly cross the magnetopause, the Cluster obser-\nvations were consistent with the quasi-periodic motion ad-\nvecting a locally planar magnetosheath BL across the satel-\nlites. This might have resulted in the repeated observation\nof regions of lower magnetic field magnitude as the satellites\nrepeatedly made observations closer to the magnetopause.\nAs discussed by Fairfield et al. (2000) (see also Otto and\nFairfield, 2000, and references therein), for MP crossings\nwhich move satellites into the magnetosheath from the mag-\nnetosphere, the action of the KHI might be expected to ro-\ntate the MVA magnetopause normal in a sunward direction\nas compared to the expected model MP orientation. While\nthe periodic motion in the magnetosheath boundary layer did\nnot generate multiple magnetopause crossings, when Clus-\nter crossed the MP at 23:40 UT a slight sunward rotation of\nthe normal was observed which may be consistent with the\naction of the KH in the manner described by Fairfield et al.\n(2000).\nInterestingly, for the quasi-periodic inward motion of the\nmagnetosheath BL (which moves the Cluster satellites fur-\nther towards the magnetopause) the 4 satellite timings are\nconsistent with the motion of a locally planar structure which\nis approximately aligned with the expected local MP orien-\ntation. If the flank waveguide has a magnetopause stand-\noff distance of 10RE , typical of waveguide mode driven\nFLRs with azimuthal wavenumbers m \u223c 2 \u2212 10 will have\ndowntail (azimuthal) wavelengths \u223c 6 \u2212 31RE . These\nwavelengths are very much larger than likely ampitudes of\nmagnetopause displacement due to the KHI. Consequently,\nthe angular distortion of the magnetopause normal detected\nI. R. Mann et al.: Global magnetospheric oscillations 423\nfor outbound (magnetosphere to magnetosheath) crossings\nproduced by these long-wavelength KH driven waveguide\nmodes would probably be quite small. This appears to be\nconsistent with the hypothesis that the quasi-periodic struc-\ntures seen by Cluster might be related to magnetopause mo-\ntion from KH driven waveguide modes.\nWhile the inward motion of the BL appears to be well-\nordered by the expected magnetopause orientation, for the\noutwards motion of the BL (effectively inbound motion of\nCluster towards the magnetosphere) the inter-satellite tim-\nings and inferred boundary orientations appear to be much\nmore complex. Indeed, in general these do not seem to\nbe clearly ordered by their timings in relation to the ex-\npected model magnetopause orientation. This suggests that,\nif the KHI was responsible for the motion of the magne-\ntosheath BL, it may have developed some vortex structure\nwhich is asymmetric with respect to inward and outward mo-\ntion through the magnetosheath BL. Indeed, in their recent\npapers Fairfield et al. (2000) and Otto and Fairfield (2000)\nhave presented evidence from MHD simulations and Geo-\ntail observations that KHI vortices can produce distortion of\nthe leading edge of the vortex which is seen as a crossing\nfrom the magnetosheath into the magnetosphere (inbound in\nrelation to the satellite), as compared to a well defined cross-\ning which is observed in the trailing edge when the satellites\ncross from the magnetosphere into the magnetosheath (out-\nbound). This results in asymmetries between outbound and\ninbound crossings such that only the magnetosphere to mag-\nnetosheath crossings produce well-ordered normals which\nare rotated slightly sunwards from the expected model MP\nnormal orientation.\nRecent observations of 39 encounters with the magne-\ntopause, as measured by the Cluster Electric Field and Wave\nExperiment and presented by S. D. Bale et al. [\u201cThe nor-\nmal, thickness, and speed of the dusk magnetopause current\nlayer from Cluster Electric Field and Wave experiment mea-\nsurements of spacecraft potential\u201d, unpublished manuscript,\n2001] have also provided further clear evidence that mag-\nnetosheath to magnetosphere crossings are much less well-\nordered by the expected magnetopause orientation, are more\ndispersed and less coherent between the spacecraft than mag-\nnetosphere to magnetosheath crossings. If the same asym-\nmetry of distorted planar geometries is generated by the\nKHI within the BL, as might be expected, then identical in-\nbound\/outbound asymmetry might be expected even during\nintervals when Cluster does not actually cross the MP. This\nappears to be in accord with the observations reported here\nand may provide further evidence that Cluster was observ-\ning the effects of KHI on the magnetopause in the magne-\ntosheath BL. As shown by Otto and Fairfield (2000), during\ntimes when the satellites are monitoring regions close to a\nKH vortex, the magetic field in theX\u2212Y plane is likely to be\ndistorted by the field of the KHI. The fact that the entries into\nregions of low |B| presented here were also characterised by\nchanges inBX andBY may also be supportive of the action of\nthe KHI (cf. the Geotail observations presented by Fairfield\net al., 2000).\nIn a recent study, Wright et al. (2000) considered the na-\nture of the waveguide modes which might be excited by the\nKHI. They concluded that, while KH surface waves are likely\nto become strongly non-linear on the flanks, KH driven body\nwaveguide modes have much longer growth lengths along\nthe magnetopause and are likely to develop to a much less\nadvanced non-linear stage. Wright et al. (2000) show that\nthe KH driven body modes are only convectively unstable\nand have down-tail growth lengths \u223c 20RE ; they suggested\nthat this could explain the success of linear models in re-\nproducing the observed characteristics of waveguide mode\ndriven FLRs. Our observations suggest that some vortex fea-\ntures may have developed at the leading edge of the magne-\ntopause in KH driven waveguide modes, however, given the\nresults from the Wright et al. (2000) study, any vortex fea-\ntures which develop would only be likely to reach a fairly\nweakly non-linear stage.\nThe observations we have presented from ground-based\ninstruments in the dusk sector also provide confirmation of\nthe close link between field line resonances and the discrete\nauroral arcs. Ground-based radar, magnetometer and opti-\ncal data all showed clear evidence of the latitudinal ampli-\ntude and phase characteristics expected of a well-developed\nFLR, including phase mixing signatures and poleward phase\npropagation. Figure 5, in particular, illustrates the very close\nrelationship between the electron precipitation and the FLR\nfields. Electron precipitation occurs on latitudes near the\npoleward boundary of the resonance region which itself is\nclose to the open-closed field line separatrix. This implies\nthat large amplitude field line resonances may excite electron\nprecipitation on stretched magnetic field lines (e.g. Green-\nwald and Walker, 1980; Samson et al., 1991, 1996). More-\nover, both the oscillations of luminosity measured by the\nMSP (Fig. 5) and the pulses of the azimuthal convection flow\n(Fig. 8) are seen only during the later stages of the field line\nresonance evolution. Indeed, the largest increases in lumi-\nnosity are only observed once the amplitude of the FLR has\nstarted to decay, presumably due to the action of ionospheric\ndissipation once the fast mode is no longer driving the FLR,\nperhaps through propagation down the waveguide (see, for\nexample Wright, 1994; Rickard and Wright, 1994, 1995).\nThis suggests that there may be a finite time between the ex-\ncitation of the FLR and its triggering of auroral precipitation.\nIn several studies, it has been suggested that FLRs may\naccelerate electrons in discrete arcs once the perpendicular\nFLR scales reach electron inertial length scales in the auro-\nral acceleration region (e.g. Streltsov and Lotko, 1997). As\ndiscussed by Mann et al. (1995) and Mann (1997) (see also\nWright and Allan, 1996b), for an evolving FLR these elec-\ntron inertial scales can only be reached after a finite time\nand they usually require large local background perpendic-\nular Alfve\u00b4n speed gradients. Consequently, one might ex-\npect that FLRs may only generate parallel electric fields af-\nter a finite time once the fields have phase mixed to inertial\nlength scales. In Fig. 5, the dominant optical emissions in the\n00:00\u201300:40 UT wavepacket occur late in the wave packet,\nwhich may be supportive of the conclusion that the FLR\n424 I. R. Mann et al.: Global magnetospheric oscillations\nfields must evolve and phase mix to sufficiently fine scales\nbefore significant parallel electron acceleration can occur.\nSimilarly, the arc motions seen by MIRACLE, on the dawn\nflank in the European sector, were only seen at the end of the\n03:30\u201304:00 UT wavepacket.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first time that FLR signa-\ntures have been seen simultaneously and at the same location\nwith radar, magnetometer and optical instrumentation; ear-\nlier studies such as that presented by Samson et al. (1996)\nhave shown characteristics in these three instruments; how-\never, they were not measured at the exactly the same location\nnor at exactly the same time. Consequently, our observations\nprovide further clear evidence in support of a strong, possibly\ncausal relationship between FLRs and some types of discrete\nauroral arc.\n5 Summary\nWe have presented co-ordinated ground-based and Cluster\nobservations which demonstrate that very large amplitude\nPc5 ULF waves can be excited on the flanks of the magne-\ntosphere during fast solar wind speed intervals. These global\nscale ULF waves possess discrete frequency characteristics\nwhich are consistent with the energising of magnetospheric\nwaveguide modes and subsequently FLRs. Cluster observed\nquasi-periodic motion of the magnetosheath boundary layer\n(BL) and ULF pulsations of the same period observed on\nthe ground provide further support for the waveguide mode\nparadigm by demonstrating the periodic boundary motion\nexpected for a global magnetospheric waveguide mode.\nOur observations support the hypothesis that a long az-\nimuthal wavelength KH instablity developed on the dusk\nflank magnetopause (MP) and that the consequent advec-\ntion of plasma in the magnetosheath boundary layer caused\nCluster to periodically sample regions lying deeper in the\nmagnetosheath. The fact that the frequency of the quasi-\nperiodic Cluster entries deeper into the magnetosheath BL\nclosely matched the period of the ULF waves observed on the\nground strongly supports the hypothesis that the pulsations\nobserved on the ground were related these magnetopause\nfluctuations. Moreover, an apparent asymmetry observed be-\ntween inbound and outbound motion of the magnetosheath\nBL adds credence to the hypothesis that magnetopause KHI\nacted as the energy source for the excitation of the global\nscale waveguide modes. Given that multiple discrete fre-\nquency FLRs were also observed on the dawn-side, with\ncommon azimuthal phase speeds which were less than the\nexpected magnetosheath speed, our observations also sug-\ngest that the KHI was simultaneously energising waveguide\nmodes and FLRs on the dawn flank.\nUsing co-incident observations from ground-based mag-\nnetometer, optical and radar instrumentation we also pre-\nsented the first evidence from co-incident measurements of\na very close relationship between FLR fields and the gen-\neration of discrete auroral arcs. Our observations demon-\nstrate that the excitation of ULF waves in the form of\nmagnetospheric waveguide modes may provide an impor-\ntant solar wind-magnetosphere coupling mechanism, as well\nas possibly being reponsible for important magnetosphere-\nionosphere coupling via the generation and modulation of\nelectron precipitation into the ionosphere.\nDespite the fact that ULF waves were observed on both\nflanks in this study, statistical studies show that, in general,\nPc5 ULF wave power peaks in the morning local time sec-\ntor. This is consistent with the preferential action of the KHI\non the dawn flank, perhaps as a result of IMF tension sta-\nbilising the KHI on the dusk side. Since the Cluster orbit is\nprecessing from dusk, past noon and towards dawn, there are\nlikely to be other interesting conjunctions between the Clus-\nter satellites and ground-based instrumentation in the morn-\ning sector. These conjunctions should allow more detailed\nco-ordinated ground-satellite studies to be completed in the\nfuture. Finding intervals when Cluster repeatedly enters and\nexits the magnetopause during periods of fast solar wind\nspeed will allow the importance of the KHI for driving global\nscale ULF waves to be more fully determined. These studies\nmay provide further evidence of the importance of magneto-\nspheric waveguide modes and FLRs as a pathway for energy\ntransport in solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.\nAcknowledgements.
