INTRODUCTION\nOne of the most important issues in current nuclear-\nstructure studies is the evolution of structure as a function\nof the number of nucleonic constituents (N,Z). Atomic\nnuclei present a rich variety of structures, and twin themes\nare (1) to interpret the observed data in terms of geometric\nor algebraic models that account for the reasonably simple\npatterns observed and (2) to understand the origins of these\npatterns in terms of the underlying microscopic foundations\nin terms of nucleon motion and their interactions. This study\naddresses the first of these goals in an area of high current\ninterest, namely, understanding the behavior of atomic nuclei\nin regions of substantial structural change, regions in which\nthe concept of quantum phase transitions has recently proved\nextremely useful [1,2].\nFollowing the development of a new set of benchmarks [1,2]\ndescribing the critical points of quantum phase transitions from\nspherical to quadrupole deformed shapes in atomic nuclei,\na number of studies focused on the search for empirical\nexamples. The critical-point symmetry denoted as X(5) [1]\ndescribes the behavior in a first-order quantum phase transition\nfrom a spherical harmonic vibrator to an axially deformed\nrotor with analytic solutions that are parameter-free except\nfor scale. 152Sm offered the first experimental evidence for\nX(5) [3], and subsequent studies on 150Nd [4] and 154Gd [5]\nalso revealed good agreement with the X(5) model. In fact, the\nentire sequence of N = 90 nuclei from Ce to Dy demonstrates\nmany features of X(5) [6], although some discrepancies do\nexist.\nTo date, most empirical searches for X(5) have concentrated\non nuclei in the major shell region Z = 50\u201382 and N =\n82\u2013126, specifically near N = 90. Therefore, it is reasonable\nto wonder whether evidence for X(5) might exist in other areas\nof the nuclear chart. Since the interactions between valence\n*Present address: University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 4AR,\nUnited Kingdom.\nprotons and neutrons have a significant effect on collectivity\nand deformation [7], one quantity useful in identifying nuclei\nnear the shape\/phase transition is the P factor [8],\nP = NpNn\nNp + Nn , (1)\ndefined in terms of Np and Nn, the numbers of valence protons\nand neutrons, respectively [9]. The numerator represents\nan approximate measure of the number of valence p-n\ninteractions, and the denominator represents the strength of\nthe pairing interaction (Np+Nn) because each nucleon pairs\nwith only one other in the time-reversed orbit. Since typical\np-n interactions in heavy nuclei are \u223c200 keV and the pairing\ninteractions are \u223c1 MeV, P \u223c 5 is the point at which the\np-n interaction begins to dominate. Thus, the locus of P \u223c 5\non the N -Z plane provides a road map for finding nuclei\npotentially at the shape\/phase transition described by X(5).\nFigure 1 shows the even-even nuclei with P \u223c 5 in one section\nof the chart of the nuclides. Most previous experimental studies\nof X(5) have concerned nuclei in the right-hand part of the\npictured locus where proton and neutrons fill different major\nshells. A nucleus in the left-hand part of the pictured locus\nwould offer, for the first time, a comparison with X(5) in a\nregion in which both valence protons and valence neutrons\nare in the same shell. Additionally, these nuclei, in which\nvalence neutrons are considered \u201choles\u201d according to the shell\nmodel, are symmetric across the N = 82 line to the previously\nstudied nuclei, in which the valence neutrons are considered\n\u201cparticles.\u201d For that reason, an experiment on a nucleus in the\nleft major shell region could test whether the underlying shell\nstructure influences critical-point behavior, as well as offer\ninsight into the breadth of nuclei that X(5) might describe.\nFurthermore, expanding the number of X(5) identified nuclei\nover a broader mass range could be useful in determining how\nthe model\u2019s manifestations are N,Z dependent, which might\nhave implications for exotic nuclei in new regions.\nFor this study, we selected the nucleus 130Ce, with eight\nvalence neutrons and ten valence protons, based on its P factor\n0556-2813\/2008\/77(1)\/014307(11) 014307-1 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society\nA.

Further supporting our selection of 130Ce for this\nstudy, an extensive empirical analysis of even-even nuclei with\nZ\u0001 20, N \u0001 20 identified 130Ce as one of two nuclei outside\nthe N = 90 isotones as the best potential X(5) candidates\nbased on yrast energy states and yrast B(E2; J \u2192 J \u2212 2)\nvalues [12].\nThe purpose of this work is to identify the low-lying levels\nin 130Ce, observe their depopulating transitions, and compare\nthe findings to the X(5) critical-point model as well as other\nmodels which describe the low-lying, collective structure of\nnuclei.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nWe populated low-lying states of 130Ce through \u03b2+\/\u0002 decay\nand analyzed the \u03b3 decay using off-beam \u03b3 -ray coincidence\nspectroscopy at the Yale moving tape collector [13]. The parent\nnuclei, 130Pr, with T1\/2 = 40 s, were produced through the\n107Ag(27Al, p3n)130Pr reaction by striking a 1.5-mg\/cm2 silver\ntarget with a \u223c5-pnA aluminum beam at 113 MeV generated\nby the Yale ESTU (extended stretched transuranium) tandem\naccelerator. The recoil product nuclei were implanted into a\n16-mm-wide aluminized Kapton tape. To prevent the unre-\nacted beam from reaching and subsequently vaporizing the\ntape, we placed a 3-mm-diameter gold plug 8.0 cm downstream\nof the target. Since the product nuclei were distributed in a\ngeometrical cone, as in all fusion-evaporation reactions, the\nplug prevented the primary unreacted beam from reaching the\ntape while sacrificing only a small fraction of the product\nnuclei. The reacted nuclei with a wide-enough transmission\nangle, \u223c80% of the nuclei in this geometry, bypassed the plug\nand became imbedded in the tape. The tape advanced every\n72 s, a rate that optimized the proportion of undecayed reacted\nnuclei reaching the shielded low-background counting area.\nThe detector array contained four Compton-suppressed\nsegmented yrast ball clover HPGe detectors [14] in close\ngeometry, with an array photopeak efficiency of 1.1% at\n1.3 MeV and energy range from 40 keV to 2.4 MeV. Both\n\u03b3 -ray singles and \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidence data were acquired in event\nFIG. 2.

The experiment lasted \u223c98 h and acquired 2.5 \u00d7108\nclover singles and 2.0 \u00d7 107 clover-clover coincidence events.\nFigure 2(a) shows the summed clover singles spectrum, and\nFig. 2(b) shows a sample \u03b3 -\u03b3 spectrum, gated on the 254-keV,\n2+1 \u2192 0+1 transition.\nTable I reports the \u03b3 rays assigned to 130Ce based on\nthe \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidences from the present experiment, including\nplacements, intensities, and the most useful coincidence\nrelations. Table II summarizes the levels populated in 130Ce,\nincluding spin assignments where possible, along with a\ncomparison of intensity values with those from the literature.\nHigh-statistics coincidence data in the present study al-\nlowed the unique placement of transitions within the deduced\nlevel scheme and more reliable and precise measurements\nof \u03b3 -ray energies to confirm energy-sum relations. In this\nexperiment, we found no support for two previously reported\nlow-lying levels, found evidence for several new levels and\ntransitions, and achieved enough statistics to make more\nprecise determinations of the relative intensities of transitions.\nIn completing this work, we consulted the evaluated data [11],\nas well as a more recent study by Gizon et al. [15] in which\na number of new levels and transitions were observed.

[15] in alternative location.\nc\u03b3 -ray line was observed in Ref. [15] but not in Ref. [11].\nd\u03b3 -ray line was not previously reported [11,15].\neTransitions from the closely spaced levels at 1323.15 and 1324.69 keV are most likely doublets. Each\ntransition is assigned a primary placement as depopulating one of these levels on the basis of the transition\nenergy measured in a gated spectra but may contain an unresolved contribution from the other depopulating\nmember of the pair. The large relative error in the intensities is due to the inability to resolve the two close\nenergies in gated spectra.\nfPlacement of transition is tentative.\n100), and relative intensities are normalized to the strongest\nbranch from each level (I rel \u2261 100). We took spin assignments\nfrom Ref. [11,15] unless we obtained information from the\npresent experiment affecting the previous spin assignments.\nFigure 3 shows the level scheme we deduced from the present\nexperiment for level energies below 2.1 MeV.\n2+2 at 835 keV. The intensity values for the two depopulat-\ning transitions from the first excited 2+ state determined in the\npresent experiment agree with values from Ref. [11] but not\nwith those from Ref. [15]. A gate on the 488-keV transition,\nwhich directly feeds the level at 835 keV, yielded a spectrum\nwith the ratio of the area of the 581-keV line to the area of the\n834.8-keV line to be approximately 7:4. These areas, with\nappropriate efficiency corrections taken into consideration,\nclearly showed that the intensity of the 581-keV transition\nis greater than that of the 834.8-keV transition, confirming the\nvalues reported by Ref. [11].\n(2+) at 1305 keV. Reference [15] identified an excited (2+)\nstate with energy 1305 keV, 280 keV above the first excited\n0+ state at 1025 keV (1026 keV according to our energy\ncalibration), based on three depopulating transitions with\nenergies 280, 596, and 1051 keV, decaying to the 0+2 , 4\n+\n1 , and\n2+1 states, respectively. However, in the present experiment, a\ngate on the 1051-keV peak (1049 keV according to our energy\ncalibration) produced strong coincidences with both the 254-\nand 457-keV transitions (Fig. 4). Therefore we provide an\nalternative placement for the 1049-keV transition as directly\npopulating the 4+1 state. A gate on the 280-keV line yielded\nstrong coincidences only with 308- and 774-keV transitions\nin 131Ce [16], produced in a competing reaction channel.\nNo support was found for the previously identified 596-keV\ntransition, as a gate on this energy yielded no coincidences\nwith any identified transitions in 130Ce. With no evidence for\nany of the previously reported depopulating transitions, we\neliminated the level at 1305 keV. This revision has important\nconsequences for the discussion of structure below.\n4+2 at 1323 keV.

We also found a 646-keV transition with intensity\n1.0(1) to be in coincidence with the 457-keV, 4+1 \u2192 2+1\ntransition [Fig. 6(b)]. A spectrum comprised of the sum of\nthe gates on the 676.5- and 760-keV peaks which feed into\nthe level at 1357 keV [Fig. 6(c)] returned these 331- and\n646-keV transitions, in addition to providing evidence for a\n1103-keV line that decays to the 2+ of the ground-state band.\nThis summed gate also provides support for a transition from\nthe 1357-keV line to the ground-state 0+.

We identified a new level at\n1855 keV based on three depopulating transitions of energies\n498, 677.2, and 1144 keV, which decay to 2+2 , 3\n+\n1 , and 4\n+\n1\nlevels, respectively. Evidence for the 498-keV transition came\nfrom the observed coincidence with the 331-keV transition\n[Fig. 6(a)], as well as coincidences with other deexcitation\ntransitions provided in Table I. We placed the transition with\nenergy 677.2 keV based on a coincidence with the 924-keV,\n3+1 \u2192 2+1 transition. We determined the transition with energy\n1144 keV feeds into the 4+1 level because of evidence for\ncoincidences only with the 457-keV, 4+1 \u2192 2+1 transition\n[Fig. 6(b)] and the depopulating transition with energy 254\nkeV. Since we could only identify transitions from this level\nto states with spin 2+, 3+, and 4+, we could restrict the spin\nof the 1855 keV level only to (2+, 3, 4+).\nRemaining levels. Below 2 MeV, we also tentatively placed\ntwo levels (1760 and 1956 keV) based on only one depopu-\nlating transition. Above 2 MeV, we identified eight new levels\nthat have multiple depopulating transitions with relatively\nstrong intensities. Additionally, we tentatively placed three\nlevels (2423, 2552, and 2760 keV) based on only one or two\ndepopulating transitions. Since these levels were not essential\nin our analysis of the collective structure of 130Ce, we forego\ndetailed discussion on them.\nIII. DISCUSSION\n130Ce was proposed as a good candidate for X(5) structure\nin Ref. [12] based on yrast energies and B(E2; J \u2192 J \u2212 2)\nvalues. The X(5) solution is derived in the framework of the\nBohr Hamiltonian by taking an infinite square well in the\n\u03b2 deformation and a harmonic oscillator in the \u03b3 degree\nof freedom. The resulting predictions for energies and E2\ntransition strengths are parameter free except for scale. With\nnew information on non-yrast structures, we first perform a\ndetailed comparison of 130Ce with the X(5) predictions.\n014307-8\nFIRST EXPERIMENTAL TEST OF X(5) CRITICAL- . . .

Spectra providing evidence for a newly identified level\nat 1357 keV. (a) Spectrum gated on the 331 keV transition. (b)\nSpectrum gated on the 457 keV transition. (c) Summed spectra gated\non 676.5- and 760-keV transitions. The 457-keV peak is relatively\nstrong because the gate on 676.5 keV also includes much of the\npeak at 677.2 keV, which is in strong coincidence with the 457-keV,\n4+1 \u2192 2+1 transition.\nThe energy spacing within the yrast band of 130Ce is\nreasonably reproduced by the X(5) predictions, as shown in\nFig. 7. The R4\/2 ratio of 2.80 in 130Ce is slightly less than the\nX(5) prediction of 2.90. Another important signature of X(5)\nis the prediction of the energy for the first excited 0+ state\nat 5.67 times that of the energy of the 2+1 state. As shown in\nFig. 7, the energy of the first excited 0+ state is lower in 130Ce,\nwith E(0+2 )\/E(2+1 ) = 4.0.\nIn the present work, we find no evidence for the previously\nproposed 2+ member of the 0+2 -band sequence at 1305 keV.\nThe newly observed 2+ level at 1357 keV is the most likely\ncandidate for the 2+ member of the 0+2 -band sequence. Below\n1600 keV, it is the only level not assigned to a particular\nband structure. This gives an experimental 2+-0+ spacing in\nthe excited band of 331 keV, somewhat less than the X(5)\nprediction of 460 keV. Larger than observed yrare energies\nare also typical of X(5) in the N = 90 region and have been\nassociated with the steepness of the outer potential wall [17].\nWe tentatively assign the level at 1855 keV to be the 4+\nmember of the 0+2 -band sequence. This assignment is based\non the fact that the 1855-keV level decays to the 2+ level\nat 1357 keV, suggesting a possible band structure. With this\nassignment, the R4\/2 ratio in the excited 0+ band is 2.50, again\nless than the X(5) predictions of 2.70. Still, the structure of\n130Ce is more or less consistent with the X(5) predictions,\nnamely, an excited 0+ band which is less deformed than the\nground-state band.\nIncluded in Fig. 7 are the relative B(E2) transition\nstrengths normalized to the intraband transition. Relative\nto the intraband transition, the interband B(E2) strengths\nare significantly weaker in 130Ce compared with the X(5)\npredictions for both the 2+ and 4+ members of the 0+2 -band\nsequence. In the case of the 2+ decay, all interband transition\nstrengths are weaker by at least an order of magnitude in 130Ce\ncompared with the X(5) predictions. Again, this resembles (but\nis more extreme than) the situation in Sm and Nd with N = 90.\nFrom the standpoint of the R4\/2 and the E(0+2 )\/E(2+1 )\nratios, 130Ce appears to lie slightly to the vibrational side of the\ncritical point. Inspired by the X(5) solution, new geometrical\nmodels are being developed to describe a wider range of\nstructures from spherical to axially symmetric deformed.\nAppropriate for 130Ce is the X(5)-\u03b2n model [18] which\nreplaces the infinite square well potential with potentials of\nthe form u(\u03b2) = \u03b22n, with n being an integer. With increasing\npowers of n, this model allows one to describe structures\nranging from vibrational to X(5) as n goes to infinity. The\npredictions of the X(5)-\u03b2n model are also parameter-free\nexcept for scale. Starting from the R4\/2 and the E(0+2 )\/E(2+1 )\nratios, we found that X(5)-\u03b24 gives the best agreement with the\ndata on 130Ce among all the X(5)-\u03b2n models. A comparison\nbetween the X(5)-\u03b24 predictions and 130Ce is included in\nFig. 7. The X(5)-\u03b24 model almost exactly reproduces both the\nyrast band energies as well as the 0+2 -band energies. For the 0\n+\n2\nsequence, both the bandhead energy, as well as the spacings\nwithin the band, are very well described by the X(5)-\u03b24 model,\nresolving one of the difficulties with X(5) by the presence of a\nsofter outer potential (an automatic feature of the \u03b24 potential\n014307-9\nA.

B(E2) values are normalized to\nthe intraband transition with the strength\nindicated by the widths of the transition\narrows.\nand consistent with the results of Ref. [17] for an ad hoc sloped\nouter wall).\nIn terms of the relative branching ratios from the 2+ and\n4+ members of the 0+2 band, the overall agreement is slightly\nworse (for the J \u2192 J + 2 transition) than the discrepancies\nwith X(5) described above. As one moves to more vibrational\nnuclei, the 2+ state of the 0+2 band can be considered as\napproaching a member of the N = 3 phonon multiplet. Thus,\nthe transition to the 4+1 state, in particular, will become more\ncollective. This disagrees strongly with the data on 130Ce.\nBoth the X(5) and X(5)-\u03b24 models use an axially symmetric\npotential in the \u03b3 degree of freedom (harmonic oscillator with a\nminimum at \u03b3 = 0\u25e6). However, the A \u223c 130 Xe-Ba region has\npreviously been described [19,20] as exhibiting a more \u03b3 soft\nstructure. Although data such as R4\/2 or E(2+\u03b3 )\/E(2+1 ) suggest\nthat for a given neutron number, the Ce isotopes are somewhat\nmore deformed and more axially symmetric than the Ba or\nXe isotopes, this nevertheless suggests that the discrepancies\nwith the relative B(E2) values might be related to the \u03b3 degree\nof freedom. To investigate this possibility, we applied a more\nflexible model which allows us to vary the softness of the\npotential in the \u03b3 degree of freedom.\nTo introduce the \u03b3 degree of freedom, we performed\ntwo-parameter interacting boson approximation (IBA-1) [21]\ncalculations using the Hamiltonian [22]\nH (\u03b6, \u03c7 ) = a\n[\n(1 \u2212 \u03b6 )n\u02c6d \u2212 \u03b64NB\n\u02c6Q\u03c7 \u00b7 \u02c6Q\u03c7\n]\n, (2)\nwhere n\u02c6d = d\u2020 \u00b7 \u02dcd, and \u02c6Q\u03c7 = (s\u2020 \u02dcd + d\u2020s) + \u03c7 (d\u2020 \u02dcd)(2). Elec-\ntromagnetic transitions are calculated using the E2 operator,\nT (E2) = eBQ. Calculations were performed by diagonalizing\nthe Hamiltonian numerically using the computer code PHINT\n[23]. The two free parameters are \u03b6 and \u03c7 , and NB = 9 is\nthe number of valence bosons. The parameter \u03c7 controls the\ndegree of \u03b3 softness: \u03c7 = \u22121.32 gives an axially symmetric\npotential in \u03b3 , while \u03c7 = 0 corresponds to a \u03b3 -flat potential.\nWe obtain a reasonable description of 130Ce with the parame-\nters \u03b6 = 0.77 and \u03c7 = \u22120.30.\nA comparison between these IBA calculations and 130Ce is\ngiven in Fig. 8. The IBA provides a reasonable description\nof the yrast band energies and the \u03b3 -band energies. The\n0+2 energy is overpredicted in the IBA by about 300 keV,\nand the spacing in the 0+2 sequence is expanded in the IBA\ncalculations relative to the data. This is again similar to what is\nobserved in the X(5) predictions. Still, we do observe a strong\noverall reduction in the interband B(E2) transition strengths\nbetween the excited 0+ band and the ground-state band in\nthe present IBA calculations compared with the geometrical\nmodels discussed above. Note that a \u03c7 value of \u22120.30 is\nintermediate between the SU(3) and O(6) limiting values. The\n2+\nK=0+2\n\u2192 4+1 transition strength is reduced by a factor of 5 in\nthe IBA calculations compared with the X(5)-\u03b24 predictions,\nbut still is slightly larger than observed in the data. The\ntransition strengths to the 2+1 and 0\n+\n1 levels are now reasonably\nreproduced by the IBA calculations. In addition the decay from\nthe 4+\u03b3 level is consistent with the data.\nFIG. 8.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 014307 (2008)\nIV. CONCLUSION\nOff-beam \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy was performed on 130Ce\npopulated in \u03b2+\/\u0002 decay. New coincidence data allowed\nfor the revision of several low-lying levels important to the\nstructural interpretation of 130Ce. An initial comparison of\n130Ce to the predictions of the X(5) critical-point model points\nto 130Ce lying slightly to the spherical-vibrator side of the\nphase transition. The X(5)-\u03b24 model, which describes the\nstructure between a spherical vibrator and X(5), well describes\nthe energies in 130Ce but shows large discrepancies with\nthe relative B(E2) transition strengths. These disagreements\nperhaps can be attributed to 130Ce having a potential in the \u03b3\ndegree of freedom which is softer than the axially symmetric\npotential assumed in the X(5) and X(5)-\u03b2n models. This idea\nwas tested by trying to describe 130Ce using two-parameter\nIBA-1 calculations. The agreement, overall, is reasonable and\nthe resulting \u03c7 value points to a structure that is intermediate\nbetween a \u03b3 -soft and axially symmetric potential in the \u03b3\ndegree of freedom. While the present work provides some\nevidence that the \u03b3 degree of freedom may need to be\nconsidered in this mass region, more extensive data are needed\non the off-yrast structures of other potential X(5) candidates\nin this region.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis work is supported by the U.S. DOE under Grant No.\nDE-FG02-91ER-40609.\n[1] F.
