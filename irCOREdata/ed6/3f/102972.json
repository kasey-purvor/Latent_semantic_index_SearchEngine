The studies utilised semi-structured interviewing and card\nselection tasks to assess 6- to 11-year-old children\u2019s conceptions of the causes and consequences\n(Study 1) and the curability and timeline (Study 2) of different mental and physical\nillnesses\/ailments. The studies revealed that, at all ages, the children held coherent causal-\nexplanatory ideas about the causes, consequences, curability and timeline of both mental and\nphysical illnesses\/ailments. However, while younger children tended to rely on their knowledge of\ncommon physical illnesses when thinking about mental illnesses, providing contagion and\ncontamination explanations of cause, older children demonstrated differences in their thinking\nabout mental and physical illnesses. No substantial gender differences were found in the\nchildren\u2019s thinking. It is argued that children hold coherent conceptions of mental illness at all\nages, but that mental illness only emerges as an ontologically distinct conceptual domain by the\nend of middle childhood.\nKeywords: illness representations, mental illness, physical illness, cognitive development, na\u00efve\ntheory.\nChildren\u2019s Conceptions of Mental Illness: A Na\u00efve Theory Approach\nThere has been relatively little empirical work that has specifically investigated children\u2019s\nconceptions of mental illness in comparison to the large body of work that has investigated adults\u2019\nconceptions.  Understanding children\u2019s thinking about mental health problems may not only aid in\ncommunication with children in providing age-appropriate explanations of mental illness, but also\ninform interventions into stigma reduction.\nResearch into children\u2019s mental illness concepts indicates that children often incorrectly\nattribute behaviours such as suicidal behaviour, hostility and aggression, and self-abusive\nbehaviours to the mentally ill (de Rosa, 1987; Poster, Betz, Mckenna, & Mossar, 1986).  Studies\nhave also found developmental trends in children\u2019s thinking (e.g., Conant & Budoff, 1983;\nDollinger, Thelen, & Walsh, 1980; Royal & Roberts, 1987; Spitzer & Cameron, 1995; Weiss,\n1985).  This research, which has investigated children from age 6 to 18, has revealed that younger\nchildren tend to confuse mental and physical illness, and are less able to describe specific\ncharacteristics of mental illness, whereas older children are more able to conceptualise mental\nillness as a disturbance of thought and emotion, and have a broader understanding of treatment\n(Wahl, 2002).\nIt has also been found that children at even the earliest ages studied, 6 and 7 years, have\nnegative attitudes towards the mentally ill.  They perceive the mentally ill as less attractive than\nindividuals with other disabilities, want greater social distance from individuals with mental\nhealth problems, and rate such individuals less positively (e.g., Poster et al., 1986; Weiss, 1986;\n1994; Wilkins & Velicer, 1980).  Furthermore, most studies have found that children\u2019s attitudes\ntowards the mentally ill become more negative with age (Royal & Roberts, 1987; Weiss, 1986,\n1994).  Findings are less clear in terms of gender differences. While some studies report\ndifferences between girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 conceptions of mental illness, with girls tending to normalise\nthe behaviour (Marsden & Kalter, 1976), and showing greater compassion and social acceptance\ntowards the mentally ill compared to boys (Ross & Ashok, 1983), other studies have failed to find\nany gender differences in understanding or attitudes (e.g., Coie & Pennington, 1976; Novak,\n1974).\nMuch of the existing research with children (e.g., Ross & Ashok, 1983; Weiss, 1986,\n1994), however, has neglected to investigate either the linguistic terms which children themselves\nuse spontaneously to refer to mental illness, or children\u2019s comprehension of the diverse range of\nlinguistic terms (e.g., \u2018mentally ill\u2019, \u2018mental disorder\u2019, \u2018emotionally disturbed\u2019, etc.) which have\nbeen employed in different studies to investigate children\u2019s understanding of, and attitudes\ntowards, mental illness. This raises questions not only about the comparability of findings across\nstudies, but also about the validity of the findings obtained with terms that may not have been\nwithin children\u2019s own receptive or productive vocabularies.  Furthermore, it raises issues around\ncommunication with children regarding mental illness, in terms of the use of age-appropriate\nexplanations of mental health problems.\nWhile there has been comparatively little research into children\u2019s thinking about mental\nillness, there has been continued research into children\u2019s understanding of physical illness (e.g.,\nBibace & Walsh, 1980; Buchanan-Barrow, Bati, & Barrett, 2003, 2004; Hergenrather &\nRabinowitz, 1991; Inagaki, 1997; Kalish, 1997; Perrin & Gerrity, 1981; Siegal, 1988; Siegal &\nPeterson, 1999).  Among this body of research, some studies (e.g., Goldman, Whithney-Saltiel,\nGranger, & Robin, 1991; Paterson, Moss-Morris, & Butler, 1999) have utilised an analytic\nframework drawn from the study of adults\u2019 understanding of physical illnesses.  This framework,\nwhich was originally developed by Leventhal and colleagues (Leventhal et al., 1980, 1984), draws\nconceptual distinctions between five components of adults\u2019 cognitive representations of illnesses:\n1) identity: knowledge of the label and of the symptomatic properties that are associated with an\nillness; 2) cause: beliefs about the factors which bring about or trigger the illness; 3) timeline:\nbeliefs about the temporal duration of the illness course and whether the illness is acute or\nchronic; 4) consequences: beliefs about the short-term or long-term effects or outcomes which\noccur during or after the illness; and 5) curability: beliefs about whether or not, and how, an\nindividual can recover from the illness. All five components have been found to characterise\nadults\u2019 illness representations (Lau & Hartman, 1983; Leventhal et al., 1980, 1984).\nStudies that have utilised this framework for studying children\u2019s thinking about physical\nillness have found it useful.  For example, Goldman et al. (1991) found that children aged 4- to 6-\nyears did understand a common illness (cold\/fever) in terms of the five components.  Similarly,\nPaterson et al. (1999) examined the concepts of colds and asthma in 7- to 14-year-olds with and\nwithout asthma.  Differences were found in the children\u2019s understandings of the various illness\ncomponents, whereby children with asthma showed greater knowledge of the causes, timeline and\nthe control\/curability of asthma than children without asthma.  This model of illness\nrepresentations has not yet been employed to explore children\u2019s thinking about mental illness, and\ngiven its usefulness in studying children\u2019s understanding of physical illness, the two studies\nreported in the present paper adopted Leventhal\u2019s framework to study children\u2019s understanding of\nmental rather than physical illnesses.\nIn addition, the design of the present research was informed by the na\u00efve theory approach\nto children\u2019s cognitive development (Wellman, 1990; Wellman & Gelman, 1992, 1998).  This\napproach postulates that children\u2019s understanding develops through the construction of na\u00efve or\nintuitive theories, which themselves are subject to change as a result of the acquisition of new\nevidence or information, and so may be subsequently refined and reformulated during the course\nof development into more specific and\/or qualitatively different theories.  Crucially, these na\u00efve\ntheories enable the child to interpret, explain and make predictions about the phenomena falling\nwithin a particular domain, and are based around the child\u2019s construction of ontological\ndistinctions, patterns of coherence across phenomena, and causal-explanatory frameworks\n(Wellman, 1990).  That is to say, this approach proposes that children recognise that knowledge\ndomains can differ fundamentally due to the fact that they contain very different types of\nconceptual content relating to qualitatively different types of entities in the world; in other words,\nit proposes that children have an understanding of basic ontological distinctions. This approach\nalso proposes that children\u2019s beliefs about the phenomena which fall within a particular domain\nare rational and cohere into connected networks of reasoning, and that children utilise distinctive\ncausal-explanatory principles when reasoning and making predictions about these phenomena.\nThus, the child is viewed as a na\u00efve theorist, constructing, elaborating and sometimes revising\ntheories that are specialised for explaining the qualitatively different types of phenomena which\noccur within different conceptual domains.\nIn the field of children\u2019s understanding of physical illness, and consistent with the na\u00efve\ntheory argument, it has been found that children do indeed construct coherent causal-explanatory\ntheories about physical illnesses, with these theories being influenced by the specific knowledge\nwhich children acquire (Sigelman, Maddock, Epstein, & Carpenter, 1993).  Developmental\ndifferences in children\u2019s causal-explanatory theories of physical illness have also been found, with\nolder children demonstrating more accurate and differentiated reasoning (e.g., Hergenrather &\nRabinowitz, 1991).  However, while this body of research supports a na\u00efve theory interpretation of\nchildren\u2019s understanding of physical illness, there have been no investigations to date of\nchildren\u2019s conceptions of mental illness utilising this theoretical perspective on children\u2019s\ncognitive development.  For this reason, the present studies were designed to apply the na\u00efve\ntheory perspective specifically to children\u2019s understanding of mental illness.\nThus, first, the present research aimed to make a theoretical contribution to the field,\nthrough its novel use of the na\u00efve theory perspective to investigate children\u2019s conceptions of\nmental illness, focusing in particular on their conceptions of the illness representation components\nidentified by Leventhal et al. (1980, 1984).  Second, the research aimed to address methodological\nproblems with existing studies into children\u2019s conceptions of mental illness in relation to\nlinguistic terminology and unassisted verbal reporting.  In order to do so, a preceding focus group\nstudy was carried out, to establish a reliable comprehensible vocabulary regarding mental illness\nfor children aged between 5 and 11 years.  This generated appropriate linguistic terminology,\nvignettes and response categories to utilise in the main studies.\nThirty six children took part in six focus groups; two focus groups for each age group were\nconducted (5- to 7-year-olds; 8- to 9-year-olds; 10- to 11-year-olds).  Three of the focus groups\nexplored children\u2019s understanding of terms such as \u2018crazy\u2019, \u2018mad\u2019 and \u2018mentally ill\u2019, including\nspecific diagnostic labels such as \u2018depression\u2019, \u2018dementia\u2019 and \u2018anorexia\u2019, while the other three\npresented children with vignettes describing symptoms of various specific mental illnesses.\nDiscussions were broadly structured around the Leventhal five-component model: identity, cause,\nconsequence, curability and timeline.  Children were encouraged to discuss freely, and children of\nall ages contributed to the discussions.\nFindings suggested that it would maximise children\u2019s performance in the main studies if\nthey were presented with a combination of both diagnostic labels and vignettes describing specific\nbehavioural symptoms of mental illnesses (rather than using general terms relating to individuals\nwith mental health problems, or diagnostic labels alone).  Furthermore, it was found that the\nvignettes presented to children in the focus group study were appropriate to utilise in their current\nform, even for the youngest children.  The discussions also aided development of the card\nselection tasks incorporated into the semi-structured interviews planned for the main studies,\nwhich aimed to minimise problems associated with unassisted verbal reporting.  In the main\nstudies, children were asked to select their responses to questions from a series of cards that\nprovided a wide range of possible responses.  The response categories and the particular words\nwhich were written on the cards were generated directly from the children\u2019s responses to the\nvignettes and questions in the focus group study.  This ensured that the words on the cards, and\nhence the children\u2019s responses, utilised linguistic terminology that was appropriate for children of\nthe age range being tested.  Full details of these preliminary focus group studies are reported in\nFox (2005).\nTwo separate main studies were conducted, as it was judged that examining all the\ndifferent components together within a single study might overload the children\u2019s processing\ncapacities, particularly the younger children\u2019s.  In addition, between them, the two studies aimed\nto examine: 1) children\u2019s conceptions of ontological distinctions, by investigating whether they\ndifferentiated between mental and physical illnesses\/ailments as two separate domains; 2) the\ncoherence of children\u2019s thinking about mental and physical illnesses\/ailments; 3) children\u2019s ability\nto construct causal explanations of mental and physical illnesses\/ailments.\nChildren\u2019s thinking about the causes and consequences of illnesses were investigated in\nStudy 1, while their thinking about the curability and timeline of illnesses were investigated in\nStudy 2. Their thinking about the identity of illnesses was not assessed as such, as the\nmethodology required information about the labels and the symptomatic properties of different\nillnesses to be presented to the children by the experimenter. Thus, all children were provided\nwith exactly the same clinically accurate information about each of the illnesses before they were\nquestioned concerning causes, consequences, curability and timeline.\nBased on previous studies, it was expected that, across this age range, the children would\nshow developmental differences in their conceptions of both mental illness (Conant & Budoff,\n1983; Dollinger et al., 1980; Royal & Roberts, 1987; Spitzer & Cameron, 1995; Weiss, 1985) and\nphysical illness\/ailment (Hergenrather & Rabinowitz, 1991; Inagaki, 1997; Kalish, 1997; Perrin &\nGerrity, 1981; Siegal, 1988; Siegal & Peterson, 1999). Associations with gender were also\ninvestigated to try and clarify the mixed findings in the existing literature (cf. Coie & Pennington,\n1976; Marsden & Kalter, 1976; Novak, 1974; Ross & Ashok, 1983).\nStudy 1: Causes and Consequences\nMethod\nDesign\nThe study employed a 3 (age) x 2 (gender) x 6 (illness) mixed design, with independent\ngroups on the first two factors and repeated measures on the final factor.\nParticipants\nChildren were recruited from three primary schools in Warwickshire, England.  The study\nwas conducted in accordance with the British Psychological Society\u2019s ethical principles for\nconducting research with human participants and the requirements of the University Ethics\nCommittee of the University of Surrey. Informed consent for the children to take part in the study\nwas given either by parents or by the headteacher acting in loco parentis. In addition, before\ncommencing each interview, the child was asked whether he or she wanted to take part in the\nstudy and was given the option of withdrawing at any time.  The researcher was sensitive to\nwhether children appeared uncomfortable with participation; however, there were no children for\nwhom consent had been obtained who subsequently opted out.  Class teachers were asked to\nselect the specific children to participate such that children with a range of academic abilities\nwould take part in the study.\nA total number of 122 children participated, with roughly equal numbers being\nrecruited from each school.  Children were divided into three groups: a \u2018young\u2019 group,\nwhich comprised children from School Year 2 (6- to 7-year-olds; 21 girls and 19 boys; mean\nage = 6.78; SD = 0.42); a \u2018middle\u2019 group of children from School Year 4 (8- to 9-year-olds;\n20 girls and 20 boys; mean age = 8.78; SD = 0.42); and an \u2018old\u2019 group of children from\nSchool Year 6 (10- to 11-year-olds; 21 girls and 21 boys; mean age = 10.83; SD = 0.38). \n Materials\nMaterials consisted of two parts.  The first part comprised a vignette describing a principal\ncharacter diagnosed with a mental illness (depression, anorexia nervosa, dementia) or a physical\nillness\/ailment (chicken pox, broken arm, common cold).  As a previous study has shown little or\nno prior experience of mental illness in children of this age group (Fox, 2005), the identity\ncomponent of Leventhal\u2019s illness framework was explicitly given to the children as part of the\nvignettes.  This allowed all of the children to be provided with identical and accurate information\nabout the name and the symptoms of the different mental and physical illnesses. The second part\nof the materials consisted of the response cards, which were used in the card selection tasks, in\nwhich the children were questioned about the causes and consequences of each illness.\nThe choice of the mental illness diagnoses was dictated by the mental health problems\nfocused upon by the Royal College of Psychiatrists\u2019 Stigma Campaign (1998-2003) and also by\nthe need to control the age and gender of the principal characters in the vignettes.  A greater\nnumber of females suffer from depression, anorexia nervosa and dementia (Alzheimer\u2019s type)\nthan males (American Psychiatric Association, 1995).  As these are also all conditions that are\nfound in adults, it was decided to use an adult female character in all six vignettes.  The symptoms\nfor the mental illnesses in the vignettes were taken from the DSM IV (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 1995).  Physical illness\/ailment diagnoses were chosen on the grounds that they were\ncommon ailments, and symptoms were drafted with the assistance of a qualified medical\npractitioner.  The six vignettes are shown in Appendix 1.\nWith reference to the response cards, the sets of responses which were presented to the\nchildren, were generated directly from the responses that had been produced by the children in the\npreceding focus group study.  Thus, the children were presented with a range of response options\nthat had been generated by other children of a similar age range (in which the causes and\nconsequences had been found to fall into the categories of psychological, physical\/medical,\ncontagion\/contamination and immanent justice). Children received a total number of 12 different\nresponse cards (six causes and six consequences). These are shown in Appendix 2.  Cards each\nmeasured 12 cm. in length and 6 cm. in width.  Words contained on the cards were typed in\ncapital letters in a clear bold black font.\nProcedure\nThe response cards were shuffled by the researcher prior to the commencement of each\ninterview, so that each child was presented with a new randomly ordered set of cards, to control\nfor order effects and any possible response biases.  The order in which the mental and physical\nillness\/ailment diagnoses were presented to each child was also randomised. Children were\ninterviewed individually.  Each child was informed that the researcher would tell them a story\nabout some people with different sorts of illnesses, and that they would then be asked some\nquestions about the people in the stories using cards, and they would be asked to choose one of\nthe cards.  Children were also assured that their responses would be anonymous, and they were\ntold that they should choose whichever cards they felt to be right.\nChildren were then read a vignette describing an adult female diagnosed with the first\nmental or physical illness\/ailment.  Following the vignette, children were presented with a series\nof cards inquiring about the most likely cause and consequence of the illness\/ailment presented in\nthe vignette.  Children were asked about each of the components separately.  For each component,\nthe relevant set of cards was laid out on the table simultaneously, and all of the cards were read\naloud to make sure that the child understood what was written on them.  Once the experimenter\nwas sure that this was the case, the child was then asked to choose the most likely cause or\nconsequence of the mental or physical illness\/ailment in question.  Children were presented with\ncauses and consequences cards in a counterbalanced order.  The chosen card was recorded.\nComponents were inquired about using the following questions: Causes: \u2018How did this person\nget\u2026\u2026\u2026 ?\u2019;  Consequences: \u2018What will happen to this person because they have\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u2019. This\nprocedure was repeated for each of the six illness diagnoses in turn. All answers were documented\non a recording sheet.  The interviewer was alert to possible weaknesses in the children\u2019s reading\nskills, giving assistance and double-checking each chosen response with the child wherever\nnecessary.\nResults\nChildren\u2019s responses were recorded as frequencies which, for each illness individually,\nwere analysed using a 3 (age group) x 2 (gender) x 6 (response) hi log linear analysis, in order to\nascertain whether there were any significant associations between responses and either age or\ngender.  Due to the low frequencies in some of the cells, these analyses are conservative\n(Tabachnik & Fidell, 2006).\nChildren\u2019s ontological distinctions\nChildren\u2019s responses to causes associated with age group.   Significant associations\nbetween children\u2019s responses and their age group were found for depression ((2 (8) = 36.09, p <\n0.01), anorexia nervosa ((2 (8) = 17.17, p < 0.05) and dementia ((2 (8) = 57.85, p < 0.01) (see\nTable 1) but not for chicken pox, cold and broken arm.  Post hoc chi-squared analyses (see Table\n1) showed that for depression, young children were more likely to choose \u2018she caught it from\nsomeone\u2019 compared to middle and old children, who were more likely to choose \u2018it\u2019s to do with\nhow she thinks and feels\u2019 than young children.  For anorexia nervosa, old children were more\nlikely to choose \u2018it\u2019s to do with how she thinks and feels\u2019 than middle and young children.  For\ndementia, young children were more likely to choose \u2018she caught it\u2019 compared to middle and old\nchildren, who were more likely to choose \u2018something is wrong with her brain\u2019 compared to young\nchildren.  For chicken pox and common cold, all children tended to choose \u2018she caught it\u2019, and for\nbroken arm, \u2018she fell off her bike\u2019.\nChildren\u2019s responses to consequences associated with age group.  Significant associations\nbetween children\u2019s responses and their age group were found for depression ((2 (10) = 34.40, p <\n0.01), anorexia nervosa ((2 (10) = 31.59, p < 0.01) and dementia ((2 (10) = 34.97, p < 0.01) (see\nTable 2) but not for the physical illness\/ailment diagnoses.  Post hoc analyses revealed that, for\ndepression, middle and old children were more likely to choose \u2018help and support from relatives\u2019\ncompared to young children, while the young children were more likely to choose \u2018stay at home\u2019\nthan old children.  For anorexia nervosa, old children were more likely to choose \u2018have therapy\u2019\ncompared to young children, and for dementia, young children were more likely to choose \u2018see a\ndoctor\u2019 compared to middle and old children, who were more likely to choose \u2018have therapy\u2019 than\nyoung children.  For chicken pox and common cold, the majority of children chose \u2018see a doctor\u2019\nand \u2018stay at home\u2019 as consequences, and for broken arm children tended to choose \u2018see a doctor\u2019\nand \u2018have an operation\u2019.\nThe coherence of children\u2019s causal-explanatory frameworks\nIn order to examine the coherence of the causal-explanatory frameworks (i.e., the cause-\nconsequence links) which underlay the children\u2019s responses, and to ascertain the frequencies of\nthe various \u2018types\u2019 (i.e., specific pairs of particular causes-consequences), the data were subjected\nto a configural frequency analysis (CFA).  CFA is a non-parametric, multivariate analysis of\nassociation.  It identifies patterns of responses that are either over-represented (types) or under-\nrepresented (anti-types), based on a null hypothesis that the patterns are normally and randomly\ndistributed (von-Eye, 1990).  Each cause and consequence card was allocated a number, giving\nrise to 36 possible response patterns (profiles) for each mental and physical illness\/ailment.  Each\nchild was allocated a response pattern based on their choice of cards for each mental and physical\nillness\/ailment.  For example, a child responding with \u2018she ate something bad\u2019 (cause) and \u2018she\nwill need to see a doctor\u2019 (consequences) would be allocated a response pattern of \u20182, 1\u2019.\nA number of types, which occurred significantly more frequently than would be expected\nby chance, were identified.  More profiles were obtained for the mental illnesses than the physical\nillness\/ailment diagnoses.  Overall, the different profiles obtained for each mental and physical\nillness\/ailment highlighted commonality in the causes but variation in the consequences chosen\n(see Table 3 for the profiles (types) identified for each of the mental and physical illness\/ailment\ndiagnoses; the first number in the \u2018profile\u2019 column denotes the cause and the second the\nconsequence).  A hi log linear analysis showed a significant association between the children\u2019s\nresponse patterns and age for anorexia nervosa ((2 (10) = 23.67, p < 0.01) and dementia ((2 (8) =\n53.98, p < 0.01).  For anorexia nervosa, old children were more likely to choose profile 4, 6\n(cause: it\u2019s to do with how she thinks and feels, consequence: she will need to have therapy) than\nyoung and middle children.  For dementia, younger children were more likely to choose profiles\n1,1 (cause: she caught it, consequence: see a doctor) and 5,1 (cause: something is wrong with her\nbrain, consequence: see a doctor), and older children were more likely to choose profiles 5,3\n(cause: something is wrong with her brain, consequence: she will need to have an operation), 5,5\n(cause: something is wrong with her brain, consequence: she will need help and support) and 5,6\n(cause: something is wrong with her brain, consequence: she will need to have therapy).\nChildren\u2019s responses associated with gender\nThe hi log linear analyses revealed very few significant associations between the\nchildren\u2019s responses and their gender.  However, significant associations between children\u2019s\nresponses and gender were found for the consequences of depression ((2 (5) = 16.89, p < 0.01),\nwith boys being more likely to choose \u2018stay at home\u2019 than girls (35% vs. 24% respectively; z (1) =\n2.35, p < 0.01), who were more likely to choose \u2018she will need help and support from her\nrelatives\u2019 than boys (74% vs. 52% respectively; (2 (1) = 3.66, p < 0.1).  It is noteworthy there were\nno significant three-way associations between response, gender and age in any of the hi log linear\nanalyses.\nDiscussion\nThe findings of Study 1 suggest that between the ages of 6 and 11, there is little change in\nchildren\u2019s conceptions of the causes and consequences of broken arms, chicken pox and colds.\nAge differences in their responses to depression, anorexia and dementia, however, suggest that\ntheir conceptions of mental illness do change during these years. The children exhibited coherence\nin the particular cause-consequence pairings that they produced, and while the pairings about the\nmental illnesses became factually more accurate with age, even the youngest children did not\ngenerate random pairings of causes and consequences, as shown by the results of the CFA.  It\nshould also be noted that the younger children appeared to rely on what they already knew about\ncommon physical illnesses\/ailments in order to reason about the mental illnesses (see the General\nDiscussion for a more detailed discussion of this point).\nStudy 2: Curability and Timeline\nThe second study was designed to explore the children\u2019s understanding of the remaining two components of the Leventhal model,\nnamely the curability and timelines of different illnesses, using the same methodological approach as in Study 1.\nMethod\nDesign\nThis study also involved a 3 (age) x 2 (gender) x 6 (illness) mixed design, with\nindependent groups on the first two factors and repeated measures on the third factor.\nParticipants\nChildren were recruited from three primary schools in Warwickshire, England, which were\ndifferent from those in Study 1.  Recruitment of the children was carried out in the same way as in\nStudy 1.  Overall, 118 children took part, with roughly equal numbers of children from each\nschool.  Children were divided into the three same groups as Study 1; a \u2018young\u2019 group of children\nfrom School Year 2 (6- to 7-year-olds; 19 girls and 20 boys; mean age = 6.38; SD = 0.49), a\n\u2018middle\u2019 group of children from School Year 4 (8- to 9-year-olds; 21 girls and 20 boys; mean age\n= 8.41; SD = 0.50) and an \u2018old\u2019 group of children from School Year 6 (10- to 11-year-olds; 18\ngirls and 20 boys; mean age = 10.45; SD = 0.50).  \nMaterials\nChildren were presented with a vignette describing a principal character diagnosed with a\nmental or physical illness\/ailment, followed by a card selection task.  The mental illness diagnoses\npresented to the children were identical to those used in Study 1.  However, to explore whether\nchildren were reasoning about the mental and physical illnesses\/ailments based on an \u2018acute-\nchronic\u2019 criterion, for the physical illness\/ailment conditions the children were presented with\nasthma (a chronic illness) instead of common cold (an acute illness), in order to offer a contrast\nwith chicken pox and broken arm (acute illnesses\/ailments).  The causes of the mental and\nphysical illnesses\/ailments were also incorporated into the vignettes in order to hold the cause\nconstant for each individual illness while the children reasoned about its consequences, curability\nand timeline. (See Appendix 1 for details of the vignettes.)\nThe second part of the materials consisted of the cards which were used in the card\nselection tasks (see Appendix 2). To simplify the consequences task for the children, the number\nof consequence cards was reduced from six to four. The four retained cards still represented a\nrange of different types of responses (medicalised, psychological and physical). However, \u2018she\nwill have an operation\u2019 was not retained, as one would first need to go and see a doctor in order to\nhave an operation, and an operation may therefore be viewed as a more serious consequence of an\nillness.  The immanent justice consequence, \u2018she will have to be nice to her friend\u2019, was also not\nretained, as this card had only been chosen by a minority of children in Study 1, almost entirely as\na consequence for depression.\nCurability was investigated with \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 cards. With respect to timeline, previous\nwork has shown that even young children (4- and 5-year-olds) recognise that there is a temporal\ngap before recovery from an illness (Raman & Gelman, 2007).  Timeline cards for the present\nstudy were generated directly from children\u2019s responses in relation to timeline in the focus group\nstudy.  The timeline categories were divided into: a relatively short-term recovery time of \u2018less\nthan 1 month\u2019, a middle-term recovery time of \u20181 month to 6 months\u2019 and more long-term\nrecovery times of \u20186 months to 1 year\u2019 and \u2018more than 1 year\u2019. There were therefore 10 different\nresponse cards (four consequences, two curability, four timeline). These were of the same size and\ncontained the same kind of writing as had been used in the first study.\nProcedure\nThe individual interviews were carried out in the same way as in Study 1; thus, each child\nwas interviewed individually and presented with new randomly ordered sets of cards.\nComponents were inquired about using the following questions: Consequences: \u2018What will\nhappen to this person because they have\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u2019; Curability:  \u2018Do you think this person\nwith\u2026\u2026\u2026 can get better?\u2019 ; Timeline:  \u2018How long do you think it will take the person with\u2026\u2026\u2026\nto get better?\u2019.  This process was repeated for each of the mental and physical illness\/ailment\ndiagnoses in turn.  Children were questioned about these components in a random order.  Where\nchildren were questioned about curability before timeline, and children responded \u2018no\u2019, they were\nnot then asked about timeline as this would have violated normal conversational pragmatics.\nResults\nOnce again, data were analysed using hi log linear analyses in order to ascertain whether\nthere were any significant associations between responses and either age group or gender.\nChildren\u2019s ontological distinctions\nChildren\u2019s responses to consequences associated with age group.  Significant associations\nbetween children\u2019s responses and age group were found for depression ((2 (6) = 22.36, p < 0.01)\nand anorexia nervosa ((2 (6) = 14.84, p < 0.05), but not for dementia or the physical\nillnesses\/ailments (see Table 4).  The significant results were followed up using post hoc chi-\nsquared tests.  These revealed that for depression, young children were more likely to choose \u2018see\na doctor\u2019 compared to old children, who were more likely to choose \u2018have therapy\u2019 compared to\nchildren from both the young and middle age groups.  For anorexia nervosa, old children were\nmore likely to choose \u2018have therapy\u2019 compared to young children.  Although not significant,\nfrequencies for dementia indicated that younger children tended to choose \u2018see a doctor\u2019, while\nolder children tended to choose \u2018help and support\u2019.  For the physical illnesses\/ailments, none of\nthe hi log linear analyses was significant, with the children tending to choose \u2018see a doctor\u2019\nirrespective of age group.\nChildren\u2019s responses to curability\/timeline associated with age group.  For the purpose of\nanalysis, curability and timeline were pooled by incorporating the curability category \u2018no\u2019 as a\n\u2018never\u2019 timeline category when coding the data, yielding five response categories in total.\nSignificant associations with children\u2019s responses and their age group were found for depression\n((2 (6) = 31.95, p < 0.01), anorexia nervosa ((2 (6) = 20.94, p < 0.01), dementia ((2 (6) = 14.07, p <\n0.05) and broken arm ((2 (6) = 15.40, p < 0.05), but not for chicken pox or asthma (see Table 5).\nFor depression, young children were more likely to choose \u2018less than 1 month\u2019 compared to\nmiddle and old children, who were more likely to choose \u20181 month to 6 months\u2019 as a recovery\ntime compared to young children.  For anorexia nervosa, young children were more likely to\nchoose \u2018less than 1 month\u2019 compared to old children, whereas old children were more likely to\nchoose \u2018more than 1 year\u2019 compared to both young and middle children.  For dementia, young\nchildren were more likely to choose \u2018less than 1 month\u2019, \u20181 month to 6 months\u2019 and \u20186 months to\n1 year\u2019 than old children, whereas old children were more likely to choose \u2018never\u2019 compared to\nyoung and middle children.  For broken arm, old children were more likely to choose \u20186 months to\n1 year\u2019 than young children.  The frequencies indicated that, for chicken pox, the majority of\nchildren tended to respond that the principal character would recover in less than 1 month, and for\nasthma, never.\nThe coherence of children\u2019s causal-explanatory frameworks\nCFA was again employed to examine the causal-explanatory frameworks (i.e., the\nconsequence-curability\/timeline links) which underlay the children\u2019s responses, and to ascertain\nthe frequencies of the various \u2018types\u2019 (consequences-curability\/timelines).\nChildren\u2019s consequence-curability\/timeline profiles.  A number of \u2018types\u2019 were identified,\nhighlighting commonality in the consequences but variation in the curability\/timelines chosen.\nFor each of the mental and physical illnesses\/ailments, with the exception of dementia and\nchicken pox, children chose the same consequence but different curability\/timelines.  For\nexample, children responding to the depression vignette tended to choose the consequence \u2018have\ntherapy\u2019, but curability\/timelines ranged from \u2018less than 1 month\u2019 to \u20186 months to 1 year\u2019 (see\nTable 6 for the profiles (types) identified for each mental and physical illness\/ailment diagnosis;\nthe first number in the \u2018profile\u2019 column denotes the consequence and the second the\ncurability\/timeline).  A hi log linear analysis found a significant association between the\nchildren\u2019s response patterns and their age for depression ((2 (4) = 14.22, p < 0.01) and anorexia\nnervosa ((2 (4) = 16.18, p < 0.01).  For depression, young and middle children were more likely to\nchoose profile 4, 1 (consequence: she will need to have therapy, timeline: less than 1 month) than\nold children, who were more likely to choose profile 4, 2 (consequence: she will need to have\ntherapy, timeline: 1 month to 6 months) than young children.  For anorexia nervosa, young\nchildren were more likely to choose profile 2, 2 (consequence: see a doctor, timeline: 1 month to 6\nmonths) than old children.\nChildren\u2019s responses associated with gender\nThe hi log linear analyses revealed significant associations between children\u2019s responses\nand gender for the timeline\/curability of chicken pox ((2 (3) = 13.00, p < 0.01) and broken arm\n((2 (3) = 13.45, p < 0.01).  Post hoc chi-squared tests revealed that girls were more likely to\nchoose \u2018less than 1 month\u2019 as a recovery time compared to boys for chicken pox (93% vs. 75%\nrespectively; (2 (1) = 5.88, p < 0.05) and broken arm (33% vs. 13% respectively; (2 (1) = 5.25, p <\n0.05), while for broken arm boys were more likely to choose \u2018more than 1 year\u2019 than girls (12%\nvs. 2% respectively; z (1) = 1.77, p < 0.05).  Once again, there were no significant three-way\nassociations between responses, age group and gender in the hi log linear analyses.\nDiscussion\nThe findings of Study 2 suggest that between the ages of 6 and 11, the children had\ndevelopmentally consistent conceptions of the consequences and curability\/timeline of physical\nillnesses\/ailments such as chicken pox, common cold and broken arm.  However, their\nconceptions of the consequences and curability\/timeline of the mental illnesses of depression,\nanorexia and dementia changed within this time period.  Findings also indicated coherence in\nchildren\u2019s thinking in the particular consequence-curability\/timeline pairings that they produced.\nThis was true for even the youngest children who took part, although their patterns of paired\nconsequences-curability\/timelines about the mental illnesses appeared to become more factually\naccurate with age.  The findings also indicated that the children at all ages distinguished between\nacute and chronic illnesses, as they provided different recovery times for asthma (a chronic\nillness) from that of chicken pox (an acute illness).  Finally, it should be noted that the children\u2019s\nresponses indicated that, when reasoning about mental illnesses, the younger children tended to\nrely on their existing knowledge about common physical illnesses\/ailments, a point which will be\nexpanded upon in the General Discussion below.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe present studies addressed methodological concerns with existing work and utilised the\nna\u00efve theory approach to investigate age and gender differences in 6- to 11-year-old children\u2019s\nthinking about mental illness, focusing in particular on the children\u2019s conceptions of the illness\nrepresentation components identified by Leventhal et al. (1980, 1984).  Overall, the two studies\nfound differences associated with age in the children\u2019s conceptions of mental illness.  Younger\nchildren tended to provide similar responses to the mental and physical illnesses\/ailments,\nwhereas older children did not, providing different responses to the mental vs. physical\nillnesses\/ailments.  One of the principal features which differentiated the thinking of the younger\nand older children about mental illness was that, with increasing age, there was a reduction in the\nnumber of children offering contagion or contamination responses for causes, and medicalised\nresponses for consequences and curability\/timelines.  These differences were also reflected in the\npatterns of paired causes-consequences (Study 1) and consequences-curability\/timelines (Study 2)\nproduced for the mental and physical illness\/ailment diagnoses.  For example, younger children\nwere more likely to choose \u2018she caught it\u2019 (cause) and \u2018see a doctor\u2019 (consequence) as a profile for\ndementia than older children.  Older children, on the other hand, were more likely to choose, for\nexample, \u2018it\u2019s to do with how she thinks and feels\u2019 (cause) and \u2018have therapy\u2019 (consequence) as a\nprofile for anorexia nervosa than younger children.\nThese results indicate that the children held coherent causal-explanatory conceptions of\nboth mental and physical illnesses at all ages, but that the factual accuracy of their thinking about\nthe mental illnesses improved with age, and that explanations for mental illnesses became\nincreasingly differentiated from explanations for physical illnesses\/ailments with age.  That is not\nto say that at age 11 the children\u2019s conceptions had reached ceiling level.  Their knowledge may\nstill undergo further development after this age.  Nevertheless, mental illness appears to emerge as\nan ontologically distinct conceptual domain by the end of middle childhood, in which mental\nillness is no longer conceptualised in the same kind of medicalised way as physical illness.\nFurthermore, it is notable that the children exhibited a considerable degree of consensus\nand commonality in their conceptions of physical illness, as only a small number of profiles\nemerged for such illnesses in the CFAs.  No significant association of response pattern with age\nfor any of the physical illnesses\/ailments was found, further supporting the view that children\u2019s\nrepresentations of these physical illnesses\/ailments are already formed in early childhood.  In\ncomparison, the children in both studies produced a greater number of profiles for the mental\nillnesses, indicating less consensus in their thinking about mental as opposed to physical illness.\nFurthermore, there was a lower level of consensus in the responses of the older children to the\nconsequences component compared to the other components. This was also evident in the\nvariation of children\u2019s responses to the consequences component across both studies.  This is\nperhaps not surprising, as consequences are more varied and open-ended in nature.  For example,\nif an individual developed a common cold, there would be little debate that the person had caught\nthe illness and would recover in a very short period of time; however, in terms of the\nconsequences of having a cold, more than one possibility arises (e.g., the individual may stay at\nhome, or may go to see their doctor, etc.). These findings are consistent with previous research\nthat has suggested that children\u2019s thinking about more complex and abstract aspects of illness,\nsuch as consequences or prevention, develop more slowly than their thinking about more concrete\naspects such as cause or symptoms (Paterson et al., 1999).  Nevertheless, even these more varied\npatterns were internally coherent, even in the younger children.\nChildren gain information about common physical ailments such as common colds,\nchicken pox and influenza early on in their development, and it seems likely that this is their most\nextensive exposure to information about illness (Lau & Harman, 1983).  Children\u2019s early illness\nexperience is likely to inform them that illnesses are contagious, cured by the medical profession,\nand are relatively short-lived.  This may lead them to regard newly encountered types of illness \u2013\nsuch as mental illness \u2013 as infectious and readily transmittable, treated through medical\nintervention with a short recovery period (cf. Brown, Nassau, & Barone, 1990; Kister & Patterson,\n1980).\nThe older children, however, held different conceptions of the causes, consequences,\ncurability and timeline of the mental vs. the physical illness\/ailment diagnoses.  They did not\nmake predictions about mental illness based on what they knew about common physical ailments.\nThey appeared to believe that causation is not necessarily a result of contagion or contamination,\nbut may result from internal as well as external agents.  Hence, the older children in Study 1\nincluded psychological factors as potential causes of the mental illnesses, suggesting a belief that\nthe mind can affect how a person feels, and that there is an interaction between mind and body.\nThis was also true for the consequences of the mental illness diagnoses.  The responses provided\nby the older children in Study 1 and Study 2 suggested that they were no longer relying on a\nmedical model to explain the causes, consequences, curability and timeline of the mental illnesses\npresented.  These findings suggest that it is during the course of middle childhood that the mental\nillness domain becomes differentiated from the physical illness\/ailment domain.\nAlthough the errors that the younger children were making may have been based on their\nown experience, they demonstrated conceptions of physical ailments which they may not have\ndirectly experienced themselves, for example asthma and broken arms.  Wider exposure to\ninformation about physical conditions through experiences of friends or family members, or open\ndiscussion at school, may well have impacted on their conceptions of these illnesses.  Mental\nillness may be equally well understood if openly discussed within the school environment using\nage-appropriate terminology and methods such as storybooks.  This may aid in combating the\nnegative and rejecting response found in children by previous work towards the mentally ill (e.g.,\nPoster et al., 1986; Weiss, 1986; 1994; Wilkins & Velicer, 1980).  \nAlthough the two studies found clear differences associated with age in children\u2019s\nconceptions of the causes, consequences, curability and timeline of the mental illnesses, very few\ndifferences were found in the children\u2019s responses associated with gender.  Where gender\ndifferences were found, girls tended to provide responses of a more caring and compassionate\nnature. Hence, in Study 1, for the consequences of depression, girls were more likely than boys to\nchoose the consequence \u2018she will need help and support from her relatives\u2019.  This supports the\nfindings of previous work (Ross & Ashok, 1983) that girls show greater compassion towards\nmental illness compared to boys.  However, relatively few gender differences were found (and\nthere were no interactions between age and gender in the data either), so gender does not appear to\nplay an especially significant role within this domain. \nThere are some limitations of the present studies.  First, the majority of children who\nparticipated in the research were English, white and from middle class backgrounds.  These\ncharacteristics may limit the generalisability of the results to other populations.  Second, the\nresearch only presented children with descriptions of adult female principal characters in the\nvignettes.  Future studies should explore the conceptions of mental illness held by children from\nother social class backgrounds and other national-cultural backgrounds, and should investigate\nchildren\u2019s conceptions of mental illness in characters with different characteristics, for example\n\u2018adult male\u2019 or \u2018child\u2019.  Furthermore, future research needs to examine the factors that might\ninfluence the development of children\u2019s conceptions of mental illness, for example parental\nknowledge of and attitudes to mental health problems, and exposure to issues relating to mental\nillness at school and in the mass media, to further aid the development of age-appropriate stigma\nreduction programmes.\nTo conclude, the studies reported in this paper have both theoretical and applied\nimplications.  They demonstrate the usefulness of the Leventhal model in the investigation of\nchildren\u2019s conceptions of mental illness.  They revealed evidence of developmental trends in\nchildren\u2019s thinking about the causes, consequences, curability and timeline of mental illness,\nwhereby younger children tend to rely on a \u2018medical model\u2019 when reasoning about the novel\nmental illnesses, while older children do not.  However, at all ages, the children demonstrated\ncausal-explanatory understandings of the causes, consequences, curability and timeline of mental\nas well as physical illnesses, and were coherent in the responses that they gave.  The older\nchildren provided evidence that mental and physical illnesses are ontologically distinct conceptual\ndomains by the end of middle childhood.  On a more applied note, the language that is used to\ncommunicate with children of primary school age in relation to mental illness may be important\nfor fostering their understanding.  In adopting age-appropriate terminology, the present research\nhas not only overcome a methodological problem of previous studies, but has also helped to\nidentify a comprehensible language which may be used to communicate with children about\nmental illness in an age-appropriate way in stigma reduction programmes.\nReferences\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

This   |\n|means that she feels sad all of the time and doesn\u2019t like to do  |\n|the things that she usually does anymore.  She feels as if she   |\n|has no energy and feels tired most of the time.  In general she  |\n|thinks badly of herself and feels that she isn\u2019t worth anything  |\n|and blames herself when things go wrong.  She also finds it hard |\n|to sleep.                                                        |\n|Anorexia Nervosa:                                                |\n|This is about a woman called* \u2026\u2026 She has got Anorexia Nervosa.   |\n|This means that she has lost a lot of weight and because of this |\n|her life is now in danger.  She is frightened of putting on      |\n|weight and even though she is very thin, she still says that she |\n|is fat and needs to lose more weight.                            |\n|Dementia (Alzheimer\u2019s Type):                                     |\n|This is about a woman called* \u2026\u2026 She has got Dementia.  This     |\n|means that she finds it hard to remember things and to learn new |\n|information.  She finds it hard to get herself washed and dressed|\n|in the morning and also needs help to eat, so someone has to feed|\n|her.  She doesn\u2019t recognise her family anymore and needs to be   |\n|looked after all the time.                                       |\n|Chicken Pox:                                                     |\n|This is about a woman called* \u2026\u2026  She has got Chicken Pox.  This |\n|means that she doesn\u2019t feel very well and isn\u2019t very hungry.  She|\n|is covered in a rash of red spots that have got crusts that will |\n|drop off.  The rash is very itchy so she has to try not to       |\n|scratch the spots.                                               |\n|Broken Arm:                                                      |\n|This is about a woman called* \u2026\u2026  She has broken her arm.  This  |\n|means that her arm is swollen and bruised and it really hurts    |\n|when she tries to wiggle her fingers.                            |\n|Common cold:                                                     |\n|This is about a woman called* \u2026\u2026 She has got a Cold.  This means |\n|that she has a runny nose, a headache and a sore throat.
