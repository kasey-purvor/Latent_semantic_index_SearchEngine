In one sense it suggests these methods have, at long last, arrived and \nbeen accepted as established approaches. That this is an overdue recognition needs little \nemphasising when surveying the number of articles drawing upon, at least in part, \nqualitative material. However, a less encouraging omen is the recent column in  the UK \nEconomic and Social research Councils \u2018Social Sciences news\u2019, penned by the chief \nexecutive (Marshall 2001). In it he asserts: \u2018British universities and colleges are not \nproducing quantitatively competent social scientists in sufficient numbers\u2019. Although he \ndoes not mention what \u2018non-quantitative\u2019 research is doing, he discusses a series of \nremedial measures - such as compulsory training in statistics, prioritised awards for \nquantitative PhD projects, tied studentships and specialist research centres. To paraphrase \nSpike Milligan\u2019s comment on army training, the attitude appears to be if someone dies \nwhen you hang them, keep hanging them until they get used to it. It is already feeding \nthrough into new postgraduate Research Training Guidelines.

So in this first report I want \nto spend some time looking at the range of topics then beginning to look at the range of \nmethods that might be covered. I want to suggest that we have moved from a period \nwhen papers were prefaced with legitimations of qualitative work, to a time when we are \nseeing debates within qualitative methods over establishing orthodox approaches and \nstandards. I want to conclude this report by pointing towards some gaps, which I hope to \ncomment on further in later reports.  \n \nNew Wine, Old Bottles: changing fields using qualitative methods \n \nQualitative approaches have long had a strong association with cultural and social and \nfeminist geographies, in part as a reaction to quantified social geography. In terms of \ngeographies of gender, feminist critiques of masculinist sciences were picked up and an \nethical argument about rapport and empathy amplified the concern with qualitative \napproaches. This also worked the other way to label qualitative work with a feminised \nlanguage of \u2018softness\u2019 as oppose to hard science. The debate though has moved on from \nover-quick assumptions that qualitative work was intrinsically more feminist or \ncommitted, to considering its weaknesses and strengths in a more balanced fashion. The \nambiguous relationship of feminism and qualitative methods can be illustrated by the \nwork of Townsend where Women\u2019s Voices from the Rainforest (1995), and Atlas of \nWomen and Men in India (Raju et al. 2000) both aim to represent women\u2019s experience, \nbut used qualitative and quantitative evidence respectively as a way of gaining attention. \nQualitative research has also had to wrestle with the argument that simply listening to, \ngiving voice to and representing the silenced is not enough (though even achieving that \nmuch can be difficult, see Wilton 1999). As the saying goes, if representation were the \nsame as power, the world would be run by semi-clad, thin, young women. There has also \nbeen ongoing debate not just on the politics and ethics of field work but also the \nacademic institutions of knowledge production and who benefits from the work (Sidaway \n2000). \n \nSo rather than studying the subaltern increasing attention has been given to how \nqualitative studies of elites can inform understandings in an unequal world. Thus recent \neconomic geography has broken the equation of big processes being necessarily studied \nusing big datasets to address global processes through the social situations where \neconomic processes happen. This has often been framed through one of two approaches. \nFirst, a broadly realist ontology that distinguishes between extensive empirical \ngeneralisations about patterns and intensive analyses of causal processes. For instance, \nBeaverstock and Boardwell (2000:281) recount how official data dominated  work on \nglobalisation in the 80s, sectoral survey work in the early nineties, whereas their \ninterviews in the \u2018global driver sector\u2019 of banking reveal the movement of personnel as \ninvestment in and deployment of knowledge networks. Similarly Ley\u2019s (1999) work on \n\u2018entrepreneurs\u2019 and business immigrants to Canada dissected tax records, to show that \nthese immigrants actually had a very low rate of economic activity and his interviews \nrevealed personal agendas at odds with official rationales of fostering new \nentrepreneurial networks. The second, related approach, a consideration of the difference \n3 \ngeography makes, looks at the embedding of economic activities or the culture of firms \nthrough qualitative methods, generally interviews, to study the deployment of tacit or \nlocal knowledges even in global activities (e.g. Agnes 2000, McDowell 1998, Oinas \n1999). Qualitative approaches have enabled the study of, and emphasised the importance \nof, seeing economic activity as a set of lived practices, assumptions and codes of \nbehaviour.  \n \n \nMethodological reflections - between self-criticism and growing confidence: \n \nJohnston has (2000) has recently argued that spatial analysis is in danger of being written \nout of disciplinary textbooks, pointing to the small space accorded quantitative methods \nin general introductory texts. However, that is not true of \u2018comprehensive\u2019 \nmethodological texts where some of qualitative approaches are just beginning to \npermeate the undergraduate curriculum, as witnessed by the incorporation of qualitative \nmethods chapters in recent works, but it hardly seems overwhelming. For instance, \nFlowerdew & Martin (1997) include four chapters (out of sixteen) covering participant \nobservation, interviews and interpreting qualitative sources. Kitchin & Tate\u2019s (2000) \nslightly lower level methods text covers ethnography, observation and interviewing - \nthough parametric tests alone get twice the pages given for all forms of qualitative \nfieldwork - but this text is remarkable for including two chapters on qualitative \ninterpretation including one on computer based approaches (using NUD*ist). We might \nperhaps characterise this as establishing a presence though hardly dominance. However,  \nwe are beyond simply championing or justifying qualitative methods and there has been \nself-reflection and criticism. In the next sub-sections I want to reflect on current re-\nevaluations of the most common method (the semi-structured interview) and then reflect \non the where some alternative approaches - principally group work and ethnographies - \nare currently developing. \n \nRe-evaluating Semi-structured  interviews: \nJust as it is appearing in textbooks, there has been a re-examination of the staple semi-\nstructured interview. In terms of the context of research, Elwood & Martin (2000) discuss \nhow the physical location of interviews affects discussion and Valentine (1999) addresses \nthe changes in who says what when interviewing couples in households. Meanwhile the \ncorporate interview is also being re-examined, in response to challenges such as \nCochrane\u2019s (1998:2123) as to whether it is really \u2018enough simply to buy a tape recorder, \ninvest in a suit and tie or a smart dress, write some letters, prepare a semi-structured \nquestionnaire and seek out some research subjects\u2019. Herod (1999) assesses how \ninterviews with foreign elites confuse often taken-for-granted notions of who is the \ninsider and outsider, and notions of \u2018authentic\u2019 knowledge in cross-cultural qualitative \nstudies. An equally mixed up set of social relations and positions are outlined by \nBeaverstock & Boardman (2000) suggesting issues of commonality may also be \nprominent for researcher and interviewee in situations where travelling researchers \ninterview transnational elites. This theme of insiders and outsiders also appears in \nMullings (1999) problematising the methodological slippage between seeing informants \nas representatives of communities or as actors within corporations. Cochrane (1998) \nreflects on how interview based studies often claim an authority from relaying \nsupposedly privileged and previously hidden knowledge, and thus undermining the \n5 \nreliability of informants is not generally the aim. Hughes (1999) thus suggests we need a \nmore nuanced and critical interpretation of the self-reporting, partially remembered \nnature of corporate interviewee\u2019s accounts of their practices - emphasising that even \nrelatively powerful actors do not have perfect access to information, even should they \nwish to share it. Particularly refreshing in all this work is the pluralising of assumptions \nabout the range of positionalities and relationships where gender, ethnicity, nationality \nand status interact.  \n \nGroup interviews and Ethnography: \nGroup interviews have emerged as an alternative approach to economic issues when \nlooking at consumers (eg Holbrook & Jackson 1996; Miller, et al. 1998). Drawing upon \nlong established market research traditions (though Burgess (1999) also points out \ntraditions derived from therapeutic practice), the use of focus groups has boomed. In this \nfield then the boundaries of academia and commerce blur in a very reflexive system, and \npositionalities and commonalities between academia and business researchers are being \ndestabilised. Thus at a time when many are studying soft capitalism and knowledge \neconomies, Leslie (1999) points out Saatchi advertising has taken on board geographical \nnotions that consumption practice is inflected by where it occurs - to such an extent it \nmarkets a \u2018proprietary\u2019 technique of  \u2018Anthropological Search\u2019. If the research methods \nseem increasingly connected then Thornton (2000) offers a fascinating account of  the \ninversions and reflexivity needed to conduct an ethnography of the advertising industry.  \n \nIt is surprising that there is such an apparent concentration in geography on interview \nbased methods of research instead of traditional \u2018immersive\u2019 ethnography. The two need \nnot be entirely distinct of course, since ethnography can combine both long term \nobservation and repeated interviews (e.g. Beazley 1998). However, in this journal, \nHerbert (2000) recently noted the sparsity of research based on extensive periods of \nparticipant observation - suggesting around 3-5% of journal articles derived from this sort \nof work. Herbert suggests scepticism about the merits of ethnography may be the \nexplanation of this weak presence. He points out this relative absence is limiting studies \nsince this is one of the approaches in qualitative work that can address the non-discursive \nand study what people do as well as what they say. Alternatively, the reliance on \ninterviews may be, as McDowell (1998), hints as a least bad option in circumstances \nwhen other forms of access to research settings are denied. It is certainly true that subtle \ninterpretation of interview material, rather than participatory access, have been used to \nreveal how specific locales enable and sustain identity formation and reproduction \n(Woods 1998; Pain et al. 2000).  I am myself perhaps more inclined to flag up the \npractical difficulties of conducting participant observation not just in terms of gaining \nparticipatory access to field sites but also securing funded periods of absence from home \nto undertake ethnographic research. The latter means getting funding from bodies that \nincreasingly want a clear set of predicted outcomes rather than an evolving programme. \nShurmer-Smith (1998) gives an excellent illustration of these issues in her recent research \nin India describing  a project that had to be fitted in one semester while securing a local \nschool place for her son. Meanwhile she had to justify how the research itself evolved in \nways far from the original proposal into a study of elite formation in situ. As an account \nof working through multiple positions and conflicting demands this is a great case study.  \n \nA different set of dilemmas and directions can be traced in DeLyser\u2019s (1999) work on the \n7 \npreserved \u2018ghost town\u2019 of Bodie. She notes that geographical approaches to landscape \nhave tended towards the archival and semiotic, whereas she followed popular practices of \nlandscape interpretation by working as a member of staff alongside the town\u2019s staff of \ninterpreters for ten summers. DeLyser\u2019s account comes from the position of a worker, \nlooking at the practices that produce the portrayal of a mythified landscape. Her work \nresonates with my own experiences with historic reenactors. Here too there were \nreflexivities between ethnography and a group that were themselves making an \n\u2018ethnographic representation\u2019 of a fictive historical community (Crang 2000). This raises \nquestions of how we recount a situation of closeness to informants and what writing \nstrategies convey co-presence and similarity of academic and participant. On the other \nhand, her ethnography of identity and tourism prompts Kneafsey (2000) to reflect on both \nthe surprising resonances, and lack thereof, of her cultural identity in Ireland and Brittany \nrespectively, where expected commonalities with respondents at her field site in the \nformer were uneasy at best, while in her \u2018foreign\u2019 site, respondents\u2019 assumption of \ncommonalities with her were unanticipated. These studies make clear that ethnography, \nidentity politics and tourism all invent notions of culture as objects of interest and thus \nshare aspects of poetics and, occasionally, practice.  \n \nStill there remain difficulties in producing ethnographies on mobile and transnationally \nconnected cultures - though some interesting studies of mobile and transient communities \nare appearing  (e.g. Jaquemet 1999, Murphy 2001). Some recent migration studies have \nshown the potential of qualitative research in examining non-elite but globalised \nprocesses, from Lawson\u2019s (2000) study of poor people\u2019s transnational connections in \nQuito, to Willis and Yeoh (1998) on the gender relationships in transnational households, \nto Ifekwunigwe\u2019s (1999) careful tracing of the senses of diasporic belonging. \nAlternatively, O\u2019Reilly\u2019s (2000) ethnography of a British expatriate community on the \nCosta del Sol is an example of a classic local community study reframed for transnational \ngroups. \n \nTrustworthy Stories: plausibility, rigour and reliability in qualitative work \n \nThere has been continued work not just on the conduct of research but its reporting. Thus \nRevill & Seymour (2000) discuss the possibilities for seeing interviews as producing \nstories. Certainly notions of biographical narrative as shaping self-identity for informants \nhave been important (e.g. Vereni 2000) and recent work continues to show the vital role \nof thinking through similar auto-biographical stories for researchers (e.g. Fielding 2000). \nNotably of late the potential of reflexivity for underwriting good research as come under \nrenewed scrutiny. Reflexivity has become something of a shibboleth -- no one will brag \nabout being unreflexive -- but it has been critiqued for implying the eventual goal of a \nfully known social situation, when claiming to know even our own motives is difficult \nenough (Rose 1997). Rather than aspiring to such transparent knowledge Bennett\u2019s \n(2000) reflexive account offers a dramaturgical version of interviews conducted while \ndoing participant observation among farming households. Her account points out that as \nan anticipated (or desired) audience, the reader is implicated in fieldwork, and goes on to \nlook at the inter-subjective anxieties so often buried in accounts of \u2018good research\u2019, the \ncontingencies, and the strains of relating the imperfectly performing \u2018me\u2019 to muddled and \nalways partial senses of a true \u2018I\u2019, let alone understanding \u2018them\u2019 -- the respondents. \nRather Bennett suggests the fragile nature of any understanding. The view of dialogues \n9 \ninvolving the \u2018citation\u2019, explicit or not, of others terms and concepts, the anticipation of \nroles and the clashing of speech genres has also been stressed as a way of understanding \ncorporate interviews by Oinas (1999). We do need to question the all too common \nassumption that there is one researcher, with an unchanging and knowable identity, and \none project, with a singular unwavering aim.  \n \nThese accounts of the situated production of knowledge suggest that the informant quote, \nor even the full transcript is poorly served by being taken as \u2018data\u2019. Leslie (1999) points \nout how researchers\u2019 concerns over maintaining the validity and reliability of qualitative \nwork in business research have entailed resisting the evidential \u2018mining\u2019 of responses for \nthe ready quote and pushing for more codified approaches. In geography, there has also \nbeen debate about ways of ensuring the rigour and evidential quality of qualitative work, \nset in motion by Baxter & Eyles\u2019s (1997) critique of the lack of methodological \ntransparency in published papers based on interviews. They endorse Lincoln and Guba\u2019s \ninfluential set of categories --  of credibility of the account (glossed as authenticated \nrepresentation), the transferability of the material (intelligibility to the audience), the \ndependability of the interpretation (whether it is idiosyncratic or partial) and finally its \nconfirmability (say through personal reflection, audit processes, opportunities for \ninformants to reply). Their call was responded to by Bailey et al. (1999) who \nacknowledge the issue of audit and transparency, to allow capricious interpretations to be \nchallenged,  but worry over the loss of idiosyncrasy and creative insight. Meanwhile \nWinchester (1999) casts doubt on the popular response of using the triangulation of \ndifferent methods - worrying the complementarity may be illusory rather than real, and \nmore fundamentally, raising concerns that rigour is being equated with an empirical \nrealist, objectivist generalisability (page 63). Certainly the burgeoning use of software \npackages to help with interpretation is often promoted under this rubric (for summaries \nsee Crang et al. 1997, Hinchliffe et al 1997). It seems to me these debates are touching \nupon unresolved arguments where qualitative interpretation has very often got an \nevidential realist flavour - that for all the reflexive arguments over positionality, the \nanalysis leans towards \u2018verificational realism\u2019 (Rennie 1998). The transcripts are \nevidence, against which theories can be tested and drawn. And yet this sits awkwardly \nwith some of the more intersubjective, dialogic ethnographic approaches outlined above, \nwhere the emphasis is on the speech act not the written account, and language as doing \nrather than representing (Laurier 1999). \n \nGaps in the literature. \n \nI want to close this report by highlighting a few noteworthy omissions from current \napproaches. Most strikingly amongst this current work we can note the concentration \nremains strongly on the verbal. Some good work is now emerging on the visual, most \nsignificantly Gillian Roses\u2019s (2001) text which, for someone who teaches practicals on \nvisual media where students ask \u2018is there a textbook?\u2019, is very helpful. It is a good text \nwith a finely angled argument balanced with a degree of catholicism about methods that \nadds to some recent texts outside geography (Emmison & Smith 2000, Van Leeuwen & \nJewitt 2001). It does not branch out into ethnographic films, but new texts by Banks \n(2001, Banks and Morphy 1999), Russell (1999)  and Pink (2001) offer a good mix of \nillustrative material and guidance on that topic. Alternately Hopkins\u2019 (1998) offers a \ntemplate for structured interpretation of visual sources, such as promotional material, \n11 \nwhile Becker (2000) provides an exemplary study of using photography as part of \nethnographic fieldwork. \n \nHowever, what does seem underplayed in the literature are approaches and methods that \ntake up the recent growth in interest in non-cognitive, embodied and haptic experiences. \nInterests in different ways of knowing and producing knowledge about the world do not \ncome through that strongly. The opening up to different methods and approaches from \n(semi-structured) interviews is something I hope to focus upon a little more next year. \n \n \nReferences: \n \nAgnes, P. 2000: The \u201cend of geography\u201d in financial services?
