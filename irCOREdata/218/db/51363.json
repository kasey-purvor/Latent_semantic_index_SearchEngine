It is shown by both sexes, all\nbreeds and occurs irrespective of neutering, with approximately\n10% of neutered males and 5% of spayed females exhibiting the\nbehaviour [1,2,3].\nThe behavioural sequence observed may vary subtly between\ncats. In general, the cat will turn its back on the area of choice,\nraise the tail and arch the back, then spray a variable quantity of\nurine onto a vertical surface, whilst spraying the tail may also\nquiver [4]. Vertical surfaces in the house are commonly sprayed\nareas, often when they are near access points or windows. Owners\nalso report that targets include objects on the floor such as boxes or\nbags and electrical items including plug sockets and household\nappliances.\nThe number of areas sprayed differs between individuals with\nsome cats limiting spraying to one place, for instance a door frame\nwhile others spray in multiple sites around the home. The\nfrequency of spraying episodes varies between households ranging\nto in excess of 63 sprays a week [2,5,6]. The behaviour frequently\nbecomes a problem for the owner or carer and in extreme cases\nmay be the sole reason for relinquishment [7,8]. Data from\nveterinary referrals to registered \u2018\u2018Pet Behaviour Counsellors\u2019\u2019\nshow that urine spraying is one of the most frequently recognised\nbehaviour problems for which cat owners seek advice [9].\nFeline lower urinary tract disorders have been associated with\nthe development of spraying and many behavioural and\nenvironmental factors have also been implicated [6,10]. The\nnumber of cats living in the household and the frequency of inter\ncat aggression have been identified as risk factors, as have\nenvironmental triggers such as a substantial changes in the\nhousehold, changes in routine or presence of neighbouring cats\n[2,11,12].\nTraditional management of the problem has included neutering\nand or treatment with progestins [13], although the latter are no\nlonger generally recommended due to their side effects. Current\nstrategies advocate cleaning regimes for the urine and behavioural\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | e18448\nmodification to remove any specific triggers alongside specific\npsychopharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions\nsuch as use of the feline facial pheromone fraction in the\nenvironment [14]. Suggested psychopharmacological treatments\ninclude benzodiazepines, azapirones, tricyclic antidepressants and\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [1,15,16,17,18,19].\nTo date a small number of randomised control trials and one-\ngroup, uncontrolled trials have been carried out to evaluate the\neffectiveness of intervention on the control of urine spraying. The\nevidence indicates that none of the currently available interven-\ntions are successful in completely resolving the behaviour in all\nspraying cats, for this reason treatment outcome is often defined in\nterms of number of cats that cease spraying and \/ or reduce\nspraying beyond a certain rate. For example, Pryor et al., [18])\ndefines success as cessation or a 90% reduction of signs whereas,\nMills and Mills [6] report numbers that cease and numbers that\nreduce.\nThis report aims to synthesize the current data from published\nclinical trials that evaluate treatments for feline urine spraying. A\nmeta-analytical technique is used to evaluate peer reviewed studies\nwith appropriate data in order to discern the influence that non-\nbehavioural intervention methods have on the incidence of either\nthe cessation of urine spraying or its reduction.\nMaterials and Methods\nEthics Statement\nThis project was approved by the University of Lincoln local\nethics committee. A review protocol was not preregistered.\nSearch methods\nPublished reports of clinical trials evaluating an intervention for\nfeline urine spraying were collected through a comprehensive\nsearch of three electronic databases ISI Web of Knowledge,\nIngenta Connect and Science Direct and one web search engine\nGoogle Scholar. The search terms used were: Urine spraying,\nUrine marking, Cat, Feline, Behaviour\/Behavior. For the\ndatabases the terms were entered into the topic section (ISI Web\nof Knowledge) or through an advanced search and terms were\nentered into the title, abstract, keywords section (Ingenta Connect\nand Science Direct), without a publication date restriction.\nDatabases were accessed on the 25th April and 1st May 2009. In\naddition, the references of all identified studies were inspected for\nadditional studies.\nStudy selection\nInclusion and exclusion criteria for study selection were\npredefined, with some selected specifically to minimise the risk\nof bias. All studies met the following inclusion criteria (1) the study\nwas published as a peer reviewed publication; (2) the study\nprovided sufficient information to extract representative data. We\nexcluded studies for the following reasons (1) cats were showing\nsexual and not reactional spraying; (2) case studies; (3) follow up\nstudies (4) brief reporting of materials and methods (5) cats\nshowing horizontal urination.\nAll papers analysed were classified according to their level of\nevidence and risk of bias as defined by the Centre for Evidence\nBased Medicine, Oxford, UK [20]. Two reviewers (SR and GL)\nindependently rated the studies, rating results were compared, and\nwhere differences were noted, they were discussed and reconciled.\nDefinition of a successful treatment outcome. The\ndefinition of a successful treatment outcome varied between\nstudies and included, the number of cats that ceased or reduced\nspraying by 90% [18,21] or the number of cats that ceased [2,6].\nIn addition, to the numbers that cease a proportion of studies also\nreported the number of cats that reduced spraying relative to\nbaseline [2,5,6]. To compare all studies the number of cats that\neither ceased or reduced spraying by at least 90% was used as a\nprimary outcome measure as it described the tightest criterion for\nsuccess among studies. However, as not all the cats ceased or\nreduced spraying by at least 90% a secondary outcome measure\nwas formulated of the number of cats that reduce spraying from\nbaseline levels.\nData Analysis\nData were extracted from all published studies; in addition,\nunpublished raw data were available from one study by the paper\nauthor (D Mills). When full subject data were presented in tabular\nformat these data were used to extract the required information.\nMissing data were taken into account when reporting total sample\nsizes.\nMeta-analysis is a statistical procedure for combining data from\nmultiple studies in order to identify a common effect of the\ntreatment.\nData were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis\nSoftware version 2 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA).\nThe potential heterogeneity among studies was tested using a\nCochran test. In case of evidence of significant heterogeneity a\nrandom effects model was used. Alternatively, a fixed effects model\nwas used when heterogeneity was not evident [22].\nThe possible influence of publication bias was evaluated by\nmeans of a funnel plot where log-transformed odds ratios were\nplotted against standard errors.\nEstimation of placebo effect. In order to allow us to include\nstudies without placebo control and assess if these studies were\nbiased compared to those with a placebo control, a placebo effect\nwas estimated. The placebo effect was evaluated on randomized\ncontrolled trials with a negative control. The global placebo effect\nwas calculated with events rate and its 95% confidence interval.\nAnalysis of the primary outcome. A notable caveat for this\nanalysis is the lack of studies with a placebo control group. In an\nattempt to remedy this we used the information from two studies\nwith a placebo group [6,18] to generate an estimate of the effect size\nof the placebo. This effect size was then used in an analysis of all\nstudies in order to compare interventions. Event rate for the treated\ngroup of each study was compared against the estimated event rate\nfor the placebo group. These events rates were calculated in order to\nproduce a 95% odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval for each\nstudy and for the global treatment effect.\nThe odds ratios compare the likelihood that the subject exposed\nto the treatment will develop the outcome compared to a subject\nthat is not exposed.\nFurther separate analyses were then performed to determine the\ninfluence of intervention type (fluoxetine, clomipramine and\nsynthetic feline facial pheromone F3).\nAnalysis of the secondary outcome. It was expected that\nthe majority of studies which simply reported a reduction in\nspraying would have used the synthetic feline facial pheromone\nF3. Therefore an additional predefined analysis was performed to\nexamine the influence of pheromones on a reduction in urine\nspraying in comparison to baseline levels. Event rate and its\nconfidence interval were calculated for the treated group and\ncompared to the baseline values.\nResults\nThe search identified 20 papers including conference proceed-\nings that reported data from 24 studies. Studies evaluating\nMeta-Analysis: Treatment for Feline Urine Spraying\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | e18448\npharmacotherapy and pheromonatherapy were included. A total\nof 15 studies were excluded from the analysis for reasons detailed\nin Table 1. Hart et al. [21] evaluated two active treatments in their\nstudy, for the purpose of this analysis each treatment group was\nconsidered separately. This left a total of 10 studies for analysis\n(see: Diagram S1).\nTwo types of trial design were noted, randomised control trials\n(RCT) and one group (uncontrolled) pre-post design. Four RCT\u2019s\nwere identified; this group included one study with a positive\ncontrol [21] and three studies of treatment against a placebo\ncontrol group [6,18,19]. One of the RCT studies did not provide\nraw data for the placebo control group [19] thus only the data\nfrom the treated group could be used in the analysis. Four studies\nwere open-label one-group pre and post designs [2,5,32,33]. One\nstudy included a within subjects control group [1].\nStudy quality varied (Table 2), four out of the ten studies were\ndouble blind randomised controlled trials and thus rated as 1b\n[6,18,19,21]; although two of the studies from this group had\nresults with wide confidence intervals [6,21], and 1b level of\nevidence is typically considered to be a randomised controlled\nstudy with a narrow confidence interval [20]. The remaining six\nstudies were open label trials, with the exception of Dehasse [1]\nand therefore were classed as providing level 4 evidence\n(equivalent to case series and poor quality cohort and case control\nstudies, and so with a higher risk of bias).\nTypes of participants\nCats of both sexes neutered and entire were included, notably all\nof the studies evaluating pharmacological interventions only\nrecruited neutered cats with the exception of one study [1]. Breed\nwas not always stated so it can not be assumed that all breeds are\nrepresented. The age of the participant was not always stated, when\nreported cats ranged in age between 4 months and 16.5 years.\nHome environment. The home environment of the feline\nparticipants varied both within and between studies. All cats were\nstudied in their home environment, this was usually the household\nalthough, Ogata and Takeuchi [5] reported that two cats from\ntheir study population spent a proportion of time in a cage. In all\nreports the cats were managed either as indoor only cats or indoor\ncats with some degree of outdoor access.\nCats were recruited from single and multi-cat households, with\nthe exception of Dehasse [1] all authors reported that they\nrecruited from multi-cat households. The number of cats living\nwithin each multi-cat household varied, for example, Frank et al.\n[2] reported a range of 2\u201314 cats per household with a mean of 4.5\nand a median of 3. A proportion of studies only recruited cats from\nmulti-cat households with # 4 cats [18,21,33].\nDescription of spraying behaviour. All studies reported\nthat cats showed the classic signs described by Dehasse [1] of a cat\nspraying a vertical surface. Not all authors noted the duration of the\nproblem behaviour, when it was reported the minimum duration\nTable 1.

With the exception of\nHunthausen [32] all authors that stated they recruited frommulticat\nhouseholds ensured that the spraying cat was identified.\nVeterinary screening. Cats entering the study were either\nveterinary referrals or screened for underlying physiological\ncomplications that could influence spraying behaviour or\ninterfere with the evaluation of the treatment. Cats were\nenrolled with evidence of feline lower urinary tract disease and\nother concurrent medical disorders (see Frank et al. [2] and\nLandsberg and Wilson [33] for examples).\nBehavioural advice offered during the study. The\ntendency to offer behavioural advice differed between studies.\nFrank et al [2]; Landsberg and Wilson [33]; Mills and Mills [6];\nOgata and Takeuchi [5] stated that no specific behavioural advice\nwas offered whereas, Hart et al. [21]; King et al.[19]; Pryor et al.\n[18] advised owners to employ basic environmental management\nsuch as ensuring urine marks were cleaned with an appropriate\nenzyme based cleaner and keeping litter boxes clean.\nDuration of intervention period. In the main, the\npharmaceutical interventions were administered for a longer\nduration than the pheromone interventions. The intervention\nperiod for pheromone treatment was consistently reported after 28\ndays in comparison to a mean of 67 days for the pharmacotherapy\nwith a minimum of 7 days [1] and a maximum of 112 days [21].\nPlacebo effect\nTwo randomized controlled studies included a negative control\ngroup (placebo) [6,18]. Pryor et al. [18] examined the influence of\nfluoxetine and reported that 0\/8 cats in the placebo group ceased\nor reduced spraying by at least 90%. Mills and Mills [6] evaluated\nthe use of a synthetic feline facial pheromone F3 diffuser, and\nnoted that in the placebo group 4\/12 cats ceased or reduced\nspraying by at least 90%. (Table 3). Heterogeneity was not\nsignificant between the two studies (Cochran Q test P.0.10), so a\nglobal effect was estimated.\nThe global estimated placebo effect was of 0.20 (20% of cats\nceased or reduced urine spraying by at least 90%) with a 95%\nconfidence interval of [0.03; 0.38]. The global placebo effect\ngenerated was then used in subsequent comparisons.\nPrimary outcome: All studies; Cessation or reduction of at\nleast 90%\nWhen all studies were analysed the effect of intervention was\nsignificant compared to placebo (p,0.0001). The rate of cessation\nor reduction in urine spraying of at least 90% was significantly\nimproved by 3.16 in the case of intervention compared to placebo\n(Odds ratio = 3.16, 95% confidence limits [1.94\u20135.14]) (Table 4\nand Figure 1).

The analysis showed\nthat the number of cats that ceased or reduced urine spraying by at\nleast 90% was not significant (P = 0.21) but in favour of the\nsynthetic feline facial pheromone F3 (OR=1.60) with a 95%\nconfidence interval of [0.77\u20133.30]: (Table 7 and figure 5).\nSecondary outcome: Synthetic feline facial pheromone\nF3 and Reduction in spraying\nThree studies were included in the analysis of the effect of four\nweeks\u2019 of pheromonatherapy on urine spraying (Table 8). No\nheterogeneity was reported between the studies (Cochran Q test\nP.0.10) and a fixed effect model was adopted. There was a\nsignificant association (P,0.05) between use of synthetic feline\nfacial pheromone F3 and a reduction in urine sprays, there was an\noverall event rate of 0.92, 95% CI [0.85\u20130.98] (Table 8).\nFollow up\nSix out of ten studies collected data on urine spraying after\ninitial treatment. Duration of the follow up period varied between\n3 days [1] and five months [33]. Two studies evaluated\npheromone use and reported no statistical evidence of a relapse\nrate, four weeks after withdrawal of the 4 week-treatment [2,5].\nThe remaining four studies all evaluated pharmacotherapy use.\nDehasse [1] evaluated the use of clomipramine and reported no\nevidence of relapse after a period of 3 days after 7 days treatment.\nAfter fluoxetine withdrawal for either 4 [18] or 8 weeks [21] there\nwas an increase in spraying rate in comparison to the treatment\nphase for some cats, with others returning to baseline levels. A\nmore typical follow up period of 5 months was reported by\nLandsberg and Wilson [33]. They noted that after four week\u2019s of\nclomipramine treatment that only one quarter of the cats did not\nrequire medication to control the spraying.\nDiscussion\nTen studies were identified as suitable to include in this review\nbased on pre-determined inclusion criteria. However, the quality\nof evidence available was variable. Half of the studies were double\nblinded, randomised controlled trials whereas the remaining\nstudies were open label, one-group pre and post designs.\nRandomised controlled trials with adequate allocation of treat-\nments and masking are considered to provide high quality\nevidence as bias is minimised. In contrast, open label designs\nwithout a control group are generally considered to provide lower\nconfidence in the quality of evidence as they are potentially open\nto bias due to pre-conceived ideas or misconceptions. To minimise\nany inherent risk from bias, appropriately masked and rando-\nmised, controlled trials are advocated, but they are not always\nfeasible or available, especially in the early phases of development\nFigure 3.

In general, perceived quality of study design was not\nassociated with intervention type and heterogeneity was generally\nlow, being minimal within the pheromone treatment group\n(Table 8) even though only one of the studies in this group was\na randomised double blinded, controlled trial [6].\nOverall, the results suggest that adjunctive interventions beyond\ngeneral management advice and placebo significantly improved\nthe probability that urine spraying either ceased or reduced by at\nleast 90%. The sustained use of fluoxetine had the largest reported\neffect. However, only two relatively small studies contributed to\nthis result, with one of these, Pryor et al. [18] reporting a complete\nresolution or at least a 90% reduction in behavioural signs in all\nnine cats within the treated group. Further evaluation of this\ntreatment is required to establish whether the results can be\nreplicated with larger sample sizes. The evidence presented for\nclomipramine was more variable with only two out of the four\nstudies [19,33] clearly different to placebo (Figure 1). The result\nseems not to relate clearly with daily dosage as Dehasse [1]\nadministered the highest dose of 5mg per cat per day whereas\nKing et al.[19] administered the lowest dose at 0.25\u20130.5mg\/kg\/d.\nThis may reflect variation in the populations of cats or disparities\nbetween study designs such as, an interaction between dosage\nversus duration of treatment. Within this treatment group, it is\nworth noting that the largest reported effect size was from the only\nopen label trial [33] this may suggest that knowledge of the\ntreatment influences reliability of the outcome number of spraying\nmarks reported by owners.\nThe synthetic feline facial pheromone F3 presented as a spray\nor a diffuser had, on average, little effect on the probability of\ncessation or at least a 90% reduction in behavioural signs after 4\nweeks only. In contrast, a large, effect was detected when\nconsidering the number of cats that reduced spraying by week\nfour of treatment in comparison to baseline. This suggests that\npheromones do reduce the overall incidence of spraying after only\nfour weeks. In comparison, the pharmacological studies consis-\ntently emphasise their effect after 8\u201316 weeks in the case of\nfluoxetine and up to 16 weeks in the case of clomipramine, there is\ntherefore a need for longer term studies reporting on pheromo-\nnatherapy efficacy on durations equivalent to those used to\nestablish efficacy for pharmaceutical treatments using comparable\ncriteria, such as the \u2018\u2018at least 90% reduction threshold\u2019\u2019 which is\nreported here. Results from such studies would allow more direct\ncomparison with pharmacological agents. Larger field studies\ncomparing pheromonatherapy with pharmacotherapy over the\nFigure 4.

However there are currently no studies to\nsupport or refute this suggestion in this incidence.\nRecurrence rate is likely to be determined by individual factors\nwithin a given case and duration since treatment cessation. In the\nlatter case it is important to distinguish between relapses associated\nwith ongoing treatment or the withdrawal of treatment before\ncomplete resolution of the original problem. In addition, animals\nmay become exposed to new stressors which instigate the problem\nagain (technically, these should not be considered relapses as they\nare a new incidence of the problem). Further evaluation of\nrecurrence rate is required for all interventions and this review\nhighlights some inconsistencies between studies. For example, the\nduration of time between treatment cessation and subsequent\nfollow up was highly variable (between 3 days \u201320 weeks). If it is\naccepted that three days can not be considered normal for\nmonitoring follow up [1] duration of follow up varied between 4\nand 20 weeks.\nFrank et al [2] and Ogata and Takeuchi [5] both reported an\ninitial reduction or cessation in spraying behaviour after pheromone\ntreatment. The latter authors also independently note that four\nweeks after treatment withdrawal that a return to baseline levels of\nthe problem was not evident. This result concurs with a longer term\nstudy [30] that reported on spraying behaviour 10 months after a\nfive week treatment period with a pheromone spray [28]. Forty\nthree owners were contacted, none of the owners had been using the\ntreatment on a daily basis and thirteen owners still used the\nintervention intermittently. Although 77% of cases were considered\nto be under adequate control from the owner\u2019s perspective only 6\ncats (14%) were not spraying at all at this time, with 27 cats (63%)\nspraying at a lower rate than at the start of the study. This raises\nimportant questions about owner compliance and how success\nshould be evaluated, since an owner maymake a trade off between a\ncertain acceptable rate of spraying and the effort required to reduce\nit. Therefore, controlled laboratory studies may be important in\ndetermining the objective potential of these interventions, rather\nthan their field efficacy. With every treatment, an increase in\nspraying frequency was noted for a majority of cats [18,28], and in\none report for all cats [21] after the treatment intervention ceased\nand this deserves further investigation, although in at least one\nTable 7.

How much this impacted on the individual studies results\nis unclear given that all cats sampled were classed as reactional\nsprayers rather than sexual sprayers [1]. However, it is often\nrecommended as a first line of treatment to neuter cats that are\npersistently urine spraying [13].\nOverall, the maximum number of cats living in each household\nwas greater for the pheromone studies with a range of between 1\u2013\n31 cats per household. The risk of inter cat aggression within the\nhousehold is likely to increase in line with an increasing feline\npopulation due to limited space and access to resources [34,35].\nFrank et al. [2] and Ogata and Takeuchi [5] both note that\npheromone treatment success was reduced within multi-cat\nhouseholds with notable inter-cat aggression. The impact of this\non pharmacological interventions remains unknown.\nSimple environmental management can reduce the weekly\nspraying rate [12]. However, only owners taking part in certain\ntrials evaluating the pharmacological interventions were asked to\nimplement management changes whilst administering the inter-\nvention under evaluation. Owners were not asked to implement\nchanges whilst using the synthetic feline facial pheromone F3.\nThus the effect of pheromones reported here may be a\nconservative estimate.\nThe studies evaluating pharmacological interventions selected\ntheir subjects on the basis of more stringent inclusion criteria. These\ncriteria will have ensured a more uniform study population and\ntogether with the additional environmental interventions made may\nhave inflated the relative effect reported here. It would be of benefit\nfor future studies that seek to evaluate interventions to use\ncomparable stringent criteria to maximise the specificity of effect.\nThe studies evaluating pheromonatherapy were more likely to\nreport on the history of the spraying behaviour. However, no\nassociations were found between treatment success and either\nduration of the problem or number of cats in the household or age\nof cats [28]. It would be interesting to ascertain whether this also\napplies to pharmacological interventions.\nWe recognise that there are limitations associated with the\nconclusions from the summary effect presented here, given that it\nwas necessary to generate an estimated placebo effect size, but we\nbelieve this does at least provide a common benchmark for\ncomparison and the basis for more objective evaluation of\ntreatment. To enable a more comprehensive meta-analysis in the\nfuture it is recommended that studies should review trial design\nand methods in line with these recommendations: (1) trial design\nshould be a blinded RCT; (2) full subject data should be\npresented or an estimate of effect size for both the treated and\nplacebo groups; (3) the outcome measure should be clearly\nestablished and include the number of cats that cease or reduce\nspraying by at least 90% and also the numbers that reduce by a\ngiven amount.\nIn conclusion, there is good evidence that both pharmacological\nand pheromonal interventions provide added value for the\nreduction of urine spraying in the cat. It is worth noting that the\nmost extensive treatment programme described, i.e. the one\ninvolving a triple line intervention consisting of psychopharma-\ncology (fluoxetine), environmental modification and a cleaning\nregime for the longest period of time appears to be the most\neffective treatment documented to date. This emphasises the\npotential need for a comprehensive treatment programme for\nmaximum effect. Further studies are required to dissect out the\nrelative importance of each element and their possible synergies\nwith other treatments (e.g the use of pheromonatherapy) in\naddition. In addition further masked, controlled trials with stricter\nstudy population inclusion criteria for at least eight weeks are also\nrequired especially in relation to the effect of F3 facial fraction\npheromone on feline urine spraying in the household.\nSupporting Information\nDiagram S1 PRISMA Flowchart.\n(DOC)\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Bruno Combes for his helpful statistical support.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: DSM GML.
