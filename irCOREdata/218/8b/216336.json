Nordhaus found that no sub-\nstantial emission cuts are warranted. Most of his critics have concentrated \non the issue of discounting and demanded that a lower discount rate \nshould be applied. These criticisms first miss the point and second lead to \nethically dubious, inconsistent conclusions and inefficient policy choices. \nThey miss the point because the real problem of Nordhaus\u2019s methodology \nis his implicit underlying assumption of perfect substitutability between \nnatural and other forms of capital. Given the validity of this assumption, \nlowering the rate of discount is inconsistent with current savings behav-\niour, is ethically dubious because future generations will be much richer \nthan the current one anyway, and is inefficient because scarce financial \nresources are channelled into emissions abatement that exhibits rates of \nreturn far inferior to alternative public investments. Any call for aggres-\nsive emission abatement must therefore directly attack the perfect substi-\ntutability assumption of neoclassical economics and show that man-made \ncapital and natural capital are complementary. The real disagreement is \nabout whether consumption growth can compensate for environmental \ndegradation caused by global warming. Discounting is not the issue, but \nsubstitutability is. Unfortunately, proponents of aggressive emission \nabatement have so far failed to provide either convincing evidence or con-\nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n3 \nvincing a priori reasons that man-made capital and natural capital should \nindeed be regarded as complements rather than substitutes. \n \n \nAcknowledgement \nI thank James Putzel, Michael Jacobs, Christian Azar, Clive Spash and \nLord Meghnad Desai and an anonymous referee for helpful comments. \nThe paper has been presented at the second international conference of the \nEuropean Society for Ecological Economics in Geneva in March 1998.

Introduction \n \nGlobal warming is an ideal object of study for questions of the interlinkage \nbetween intra- and inter-generational distribution and questions of sus-\ntainability under uncertainty.1 Its essential features are that current eco-\nnomic activity has large-scale long-term future consequences on both en-\nvironmental amenities and the capacity to provide material well-being. \nWhile there is some (contested) evidence that global warming is already \nunder way and water cycles as well as ecosystems react upon it (Environ-\nmental Protection Agency 1997, p. 8), the bulk of impacts of global warm-\ning will clearly not be felt for another 50 years or so (Fankhauser and Tol \n1996, p. 665; Mendelsohn and Neumann 1999). That is, global warming \nwill impact mainly upon future generations but mostly not the current \none. Hence the benefits of abating greenhouse gas emissions will be en-\njoyed by future generations, while the costs of abating greenhouse emis-\nsions are borne by the current generation. \nBut the members of future generations will rather unequally gain from \nabating greenhouse gas emissions. As a general rule, the closer a country \nto the equator the higher its damage from global warming is likely to be \nand hence its gain from emission abatement (Mendelsohn and Neumann \n1999). The specific vulnerability towards climate change depends on a \nrange of factors including a country\u2019s geophysical characteristics, but also \nits socio-institutional and infrastructural capacity. Low-level islands are \nmore at risk than highlands, developed countries with their advanced ca-\nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n5 \npacity to adapt and prevent are less vulnerable than developing countries. \nInterestingly, some members of future generations who happen to live in \ncold countries close to the poles, as for example Russia, might even gain \nfrom warming and be hurt by abating greenhouse gas emissions (Fank-\nhauser and Tol 1996, p. 669). \nTo make things still more complicated, the likely size of gains from \nemission abatement is a highly contested matter as well. Older estimates \nof damage due to a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere range between 1 \nand 2.5% of GDP (IPCC 1996b, p. 203). More recent studies which better \ntake into account sectors that might benefit from warming (such as citrus \ncropping and summer recreational activities) and the possibilities for effi-\ncient adaptive behaviour to reduce potential damages come to much \nsmaller estimates. Indeed, they do not exclude the possibility that modest \nglobal warming might be beneficial \u2014 even for those countries that earlier \nstudies expected to be damaged by warming (see Mendelsohn and Neu-\nmann 1999). \nIn this paper I discuss the relevance of the issues of discounting and \nsubstitutability on addressing global warming.2 The neoclassical approach \ntowards global warming has tended to recommend only minor abatement \npolicies for greenhouse gases. Nordhaus (1994, p. 94), e.g., suggests an op-\ntimal reduction rate of greenhouse gases in 2025 of 11.1% of uncontrolled \nemissions and of 13.4% in 2075. Note that because uncontrolled emissions \nare expected to grow tremendously over time, Nordhaus\u2019s optimal policy \nrecommendation does not call for any emission cuts relative to, say, the \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n6 \n1990 level, but for further and substantial increases in greenhouse gas \nemissions over time that are only slightly lower than uncontrolled emis-\nsions (see Nordhaus 1994, p. 87).3 \nEnvironmentalists and ecologically oriented economists have criticised \nthe neoclassical approach towards global warming. Mostly, they have \nconcentrated on the question of discounting and demanded to apply a \nlower rate of discount for reasons of intra- as well as inter-generational \nfairness (e.g. Broome 1992, Azar and Sterner 1996). Because the distribu-\ntion of the net costs of global warming is heavily skewed towards the dis-\ntant future, using a lower rate of discount would warrant higher emission \nabatement (Fankhauser 1994; Chapman, Suri and Hall 1995). \nThis paper argues that the demand for a lower discount rate misses the \npoint and leads to inefficient policy choices. It misses the point because it \nfails to address the real issue which is the underlying assumption of per-\nfect substitutability of natural through other forms of capital rather than \nthe appropriate selection of a discount rate. It leads to inefficiencies be-\ncause, given perfect substitutability, lowering the discount rate in general \nor for global warming in particular would channel scarce resources away \nfrom their most productive uses. Maybe surprisingly, the demand for a \nlower discount rate is dubious on ethical grounds as well since it calls to \ngive greater weight to future generations who, given perfect substitutabil-\nity, are likely to be substantially better off than the current generation \nanyway. \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n7 \nParts of the argument against changing the rate of discount can already \nbe found in Lind (1995) and Schelling (1995). What these authors do not \nexplicate, however, is that their objections are only valid if the underlying \nassumption of perfect substitutability is valid. Most authors seem to be \nunaware of the crucial importance of this assumption for policy implica-\ntions on global warming. It is the aim of the paper therefore to highlight \nthis importance. \nDiffering assumptions about the substitutability of natural capital are \nclosely linked to the quarrel between two competing paradigms of sus-\ntainability: weak and strong sustainability.4 Weak sustainability is based \non the work of Robert Solow (1974, 1993a,b) and John Hartwick (1977, \n1990) and can be called the \u2018perfect substitutability paradigm\u2019. Weak sus-\ntainability requires keeping aggregate total net investment, suitably defined, \nabove or equal to zero (the so-called Hartwick-rule). Loosely speaking, this \nrequirement is equivalent to keeping the aggregate total value of man-made \ncapital and natural capital at least constant.5 Natural capital and man-\nmade capital are seen as substitutes for each other both in production and \nutility functions. This means that natural capital can be safely run down as \nlong as enough human-made capital is built up in exchange: it does not \nmatter whether the current generation uses up non-renewable resources \nor dumps CO2 in the atmosphere as long as enough machines, roads and \nports are built up in compensation. In the words of Solow: \u201eEarlier genera-\ntions are entitled to draw down the pool (optimally, of course!) so long as \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n8 \nthey add (optimally, of course!) to the stock of reproducible capital\u201c (So-\nlow 1974, p. 41). \nStrong sustainability, instead, calls for keeping both the aggregate total \nvalue of man-made capital and natural capital and the total value of natural \ncapital itself at least constant. This paradigm was mainly developed by \nHerman Daly and Robert Costanza (Daly 1992, 1996; Daly and Costanza \n1992). The reason for emphasising the need to keep the total value of natu-\nral capital at least constant is as follows: First, man-made capital and natu-\nral capital are thought of as being complementary and not substitutable to \neach other. Strong sustainability can therefore be labelled the \u2018complemen-\ntarity paradigm\u2019. Second, due to population growth, past environmental \ndegradation and resource depletion, natural capital is regarded as the lim-\niting factor. Strong sustainability also holds that rising consumption can-\nnot compensate future generations for environmental degradation, i.e. it \ncannot substitute for a declining stock of directly utility relevant renew-\nable resources and a rising stock of pollution. \nThis paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the neoclassical \napproach towards global warming for which Nordhaus\u2019s well-known \nmodels are representative. Section 3 argues that the question of discount-\ning, on which most of the critics of Nordhaus have concentrated, is not the \nrelevant issue. Section 4 shows that to challenge the neoclassical approach \ntowards global warming, one must instead directly attack the heart of the \nassumption on which its way to discount the future rests: the assumption \nof perfect substitutability of natural capital. Section 5 concludes. \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n9 \n \n \n2. The neoclassical approach towards global warming: The Nordhaus-\nmodels \n \nDiscussing global warming is no easy task: The science and economics of \nglobal warming is complex (see IPCC 1996a,b), there are numerous highly \ntechnical models for cost-benefit analysis (IPCC 1996b, pp. 374-396) and \nthere is a vast and continually growing literature discussing the pros and \ncons of action. Quite clearly, I cannot and do not want to discuss all the \ndetails of this debate. Indeed, I will concentrate on those few aspects that \nare directly relevant to the issues of discounting and substitutability. Fur-\nthermore, I will restrict my discussion to the cost-benefit analysis of the \n'DICE-model' in Nordhaus (1994), the updated and expanded version of \nNordhaus (1991a), because this is the best known and best documented \nstudy and is representative in many respects of other studies using similar \nmodels which are reviewed in Toth (1995). The model in Nordhaus (1994) \nis itself updated in Nordhaus and Popp (1997) which is \u201ebasically a ver-\nsion of the DICE model that adds another dimension, that of different un-\ncertain states of the world\u201c (p. 3). All the fundamental objections that ap-\nply to Nordhaus (1994) are valid for Nordhaus and Popp (1997) as well. \nNordhaus\u2019s (1994) DICE-model \u2014 the Dynamic Integrated Model of \nClimate and the Economy \u2014 is a dynamic optimisation economic growth \nmodel based on Ramsey (1928) in which a social planner maximises the \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n10 \nintegrated sum of the utility of per capita consumption.6 Output is pro-\nduced by a constant returns to scale Cobb-Douglas production function. \nOutput production generates greenhouse emissions which lead to global \nwarming which leads, in turn, to losses in output. For a quick overview of \nthe model see Nordhaus (1994, chapter 2, pp. 7-21). \nNordhaus implicitly assumes the validity of \u2018perfect substitutability\u2019 \nwhich is the centre of the paradigm of weak sustainability. He does so in \ntwo closely related ways: First, benefits and costs are meshed together and \ncomputed as shares of total output \u2014 regardless of whether they are con-\nnected to environmental amenities or consumption related. The only costs \ndue to global warming are costs in the form of output losses. This is valid \nonly if future generations do not care about whether, say, the costs of \nglobal warming are connected to environmental amenities that provide \nthem with direct utility or restrain their capacity to consume material \ngoods. Second, Nordhaus presumes perfect substitutability in the way he \ndiscounts the future. His formula for discounting is the well known Ram-\nsey (1928) formula: \n \n  r C C\nC\n= + \u22c5\n\u22c5\n\u03c1 \u03b7( )  \n \nThe social discount rate r should be equal to the sum of the pure rate of \ntime preference \u03c1 and the product of the elasticity of the marginal utility \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n11 \nof consumption \u03b7(C) and the per capita growth rate of consumption C\nC\n\u22c5\n. If \n\u03c1 > 0, this is called (pure) utility discounting. Nordhaus (1994, p. 123) calls \ndiscounting because of \u03b7(C) C\nC\n\u22c5\n > 0 \u201egrowth discounting\u201c. \nNordhaus sets the pure rate of time preference \u03c1 equal to 3% (Nord-\nhaus 1994, p. 11). He assumes a logarithmic utility function for which \u03b7(C) \nis equal to 1 (ibid., p. 11f.) and projects \nC\nC\n\u22c5\n to be about 3% in the first few \nyears, declining slowly in later years (ibid., p. 125). Hence his overall dis-\ncount rate is approximately 6%. \nSetting the pure rate of time preference equal to 3% is controversial and \nNordhaus\u2019s reasons as well as the criticism thereof will be discussed later \non. The rate of pure time preference is of no particular relevance for our \nargument that Nordhaus implicitly assumes the validity of the \u2018perfect \nsubstitutability paradigm\u2019, however. Setting \u03b7(C) equal to 1 is somewhat \narbitrary, but so is more or less any assumption about the algebraic form \nof the representative consumer\u2019s utility function from which the elasticity \nof the marginal utility of consumption follows. Instead of simply assum-\ning a specific utility function, one can also try to infer values for \u03b7(C) from \nactual consumption decisions. Pearce and Ulph (1995, p. 17) have re-\nviewed studies that have done this and provide a best estimate for \u03b7(C) of \n0.8 with a lower bound of 0.7 and an upper bound of 1.5. Nordhaus\u2019s se-\nlection of \u03b7(C) = 1 appears to be acceptable therefore. The more problem-\nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n12 \natic part is \nC\nC\n\u22c5\n. Nordhaus estimates output to grow at about 3% p.a. This is \na rather high estimate and others have come up with lower figures \u2014 see \nthe discussion further below. Naturally, predicting future growth rates is \nnever easy and always reflects a best guess that can turn out to be wrong \nex post. \nThe specific value of \nC\nC\n\u22c5\n is not relevant for our discussion here, how-\never. Whatever its value, the underlying assumption is invariably that en-\nvironmental costs and benefits are substitutable by material benefits and \ncosts. To see why, recall the ethical rationale for the inclusion of \u03b7(C) C\nC\n\u22c5\n in \nthe Ramsey-formula: Given that \u03b7(C) C\nC\n\u22c5\n>0, the future should count less \nbecause it is then presumed to be better off due to the increase in consump-\ntion (weighted by the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption). \nThat is, future losses arising from global warming, e.g. in the form of envi-\nronmental amenities, are implicitly assumed to be perfectly compensable \nby increased consumption! Natural and other forms of capital are perfect \nsubstitutes! \nOne might think that if the current generation was committed to weak \nsustainability, i.e. to ensuring that the welfare of future generations is at \nleast as high as the current generation's welfare, this would demand \nhigher emission abatement than found by Nordhaus since he does not ex-\nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n13 \nplicitly take weak sustainability as a side-constraint to his cost-benefit \nanalysis. This is not true, however. Solely judged from the requirements of \nnon-declining welfare it is most likely that no explicit abatement policy \nwhatsoever is warranted!7 The reason is that if, as all estimates seem to \nagree upon, damages from unrestricted emissions are to be less than 10% \nof GNP (IPCC 1996b, p. 218) by the middle of the next century and future \ngenerations are likely to be materially better off by much more than 10%, \nthen there is no need to combat global warming in order to ensure non-\ndeclining welfare into the future \u2014 given the validity of the \u2018perfect sub-\nstitutability paradigm\u2019. In this sense, Nordhaus\u2019s computations are more \nfriendly to future generations than a mere commitment to keep welfare at \nleast non-declining would be!8 \n \n \n3. Critiques of the Nordhaus-models: why discounting is not the issue \n \nMany aspects of Nordhaus\u2019s methodology have been attacked. To give but \na few examples: \n \n\u2022 Ayres and Walter (1991) contend that Nordhaus\u2019s land prices and vul-\nnerability coefficients are too low. \n\u2022 Cline (1996) criticises Nordhaus\u2019s method of computing agricultural \ncosts as biased towards producing low estimates. \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n14 \n\u2022 Ekins (1996) suggests that taking into account beneficial side-effects of \nrestricting CO2-emissions such as reductions in SOx- and NOx-emissions \n(so-called secondary benefits), which Nordhaus ignores, would warrant \nmuch higher abatement. \n\u2022 Howarth (1996) criticises Nordhaus for ignoring people\u2019s non-use val-\nues for the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems and, more gener-\nally, for largely neglecting negative impacts of global warming on eco-\nsystems. \n\u2022 Tol (1994) suggests that intangible goods should directly enter the util-\nity-function rather than the production function. \n\u2022 Chapman, Suri and Hall (1995) examine the consequences of a doubling \nof the CO2-concentration in the atmosphere causing higher tempera-\ntures than expected by Nordhaus. \n\u2022 Price (1995) contends that Nordhaus overestimates the uptake of CO2-\nemissions in the oceans. \n\u2022 Mendelsohn and Neumann (1998), on the other hand, come to the con-\nclusion that Nordhaus rather overestimates damage from global warm-\ning since he underestimates the possibilities for adaptation opportuni-\nties. \n \nI cannot discuss these criticisms here for reasons of space. Rather I will \nconcentrate on the question of discounting on which most critics of Nord-\nhaus have focused. Lowering the applied discount rate would drastically \nincrease the warranted emission abatement, as confirmed by Fankhauser \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n15 \n(1994) and Chapman, Suri and Hall (1995), because the distribution func-\ntion of the net costs of global warming is heavily skewed towards the dis-\ntant future. \nBefore examining the demand to use lower discount rates in detail, let \nus first look at why Nordhaus sets the pure rate of time preference equal \nto 3%. He does so because he believes in economic efficiency. Estimates of \nthe real rate of return to investment, which is also called the opportunity \ncost of investment, vary, but they usually lie in the range of 4% to 10% p.a. \nin developed countries (Nordhaus 1991a, p. 926). Manne and Richels \n(1995, p. 5) believe that 5% represents a lower bound, Pearce (1993, p. 60) \nthinks that 7% comes close to the long-run average real rate of return, \nCline (1992, p. 262) estimates it to be about 8%. The World Bank usually \ndoes not accept a project with a rate of return of less than 10% (Markandya \nand Pearce 1991, p. 140). So Nordhaus\u2019s estimate of 6% represents a good, \nconservative guess of the real return. Now, efficiency requires that the \ngovernment does not use a discount rate different from the opportunity \ncost. Hence with \u03b7(C) C\nC\n\u22c5\n to be estimated as 3%, it can be inferred that soci-\nety\u2019s pure rate of time preference must be 3% because only then is the so-\ncial discount rate equal to the opportunity cost of investment: \n3% + 3% = 6%.9 \nThe reason why the government should not use a discount rate differ-\nent from the opportunity cost of investment is that using a different, say \nlower, rate would channel scarce financial resources away from invest-\nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n16 \nments that provide the future with a higher real rate of return. This ineffi-\nciency can arise within the limits of a given public budget in that resources \nare channelled away from highly productive public investments in pri-\nmary education, say, towards emission abatement with a lower real rate of \nreturn. It can also arise with an endogenously determined public budget \nin crowding out highly productive private investments for the sake of \nlow-return public investments into emission abatement. No doubt, the \nreader will realise that this argument is valid only if the \u2018perfect substitut-\nability paradigm\u2019 is valid. \nLet us now turn to the critique towards Nordhaus\u2019s approach towards \ndiscounting. Many economists and philosophers have since long de-\nmanded to set the pure rate of time preference equal to zero for reasons of \ninter-generational fairness: being later in time should as such be no reason \nfor counting less (e.g. Ramsey 1928, Pigou 1932, Rawls 1972, Broome 1992, \nCline 1992, Azar and Sterner 1996). The main argument is that future gen-\nerations are excluded from today\u2019s market and political decisions (e.g. \nBroome 1992, p. 89f.). If future generations could reveal their preferences \nthey would surely opt for higher investments for the benefit of the future, \nthus driving down the real rate of return on investment. Since we cannot \nknow counter-factually what the real rate of return on investment would \nbe if future generations were not excluded from today\u2019s market and politi-\ncal decisions, it can be said to be fair to set the pure rate of time preference \nequal to zero: Being later in time should be no reason for counting less. \nHence the discount rate would be down to 3% from 6%. \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n17 \nBut that is not the end of the story. Critics have also argued that Nord-\nhaus\u2019s projection of \nC\nC\n\u22c5\n might be too high (Rabl 1996, p. 143). Cline (1992, \np. 284ff.), in remembrance of the dismal per capita growth performance of \nmany developing countries in the 1980s, projects worldwide \nC\nC\n\u22c5\n to be \nabout 1.5% in the middle of the next century, 1% by 2100 and 0.5% by 2275 \nwhich would bring down the rate of discount to 0.5%-1.5%. Azar and \nSterner (1996, pp. 177ff.) have further abandoned the assumption of a \nworldwide representative consumer and have examined the consequences \nof intra-generational unequal distribution. They argue as follows: If it is \nright to apply the Ramsey-formula to future generations and ask what \ntheir marginal utility of rising consumption is, then it must also be right to \nask for the marginal utility of the much poorer people in the present-day \ndeveloping world. It was taken as a justification for discounting that fu-\nture generations are expected to be better off in Ramsey\u2019s formula. For the \nsame reason Azar and Sterner (1996, p. 178) argue \u201ethat a given (...) cost \nwhich affects a poor person (in a poor country) should be valued as a higher \nwelfare cost than an equivalent cost affecting an average OECD citizen [italics in \noriginal, E.N.]\u201c. \nBecause the costs of global warming are relatively higher in developing \ncountries than in developed countries because of their greater vulnerabil-\nity and their more restricted capacity for adaptation (IPCC 1996b, p. 218), \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n18 \nadjusting \nC\nC\n\u22c5\n along the lines of Azar and Sterner (1996) substantially in-\ncreases the level of abatement that is warranted by a cost-benefit analysis \nof global warming. The same holds true for reducing the pure rate of time \npreference (possibly to zero) or lowering estimates of \nC\nC\n\u22c5\n for the represen-\ntative world consumer. \nAlthough I have some sympathy for these criticisms I will now argue \nthat they first miss the point and second lead to ethically dubious and in-\nconsistent conclusions and inefficient policy choices. The two points are \nlinked together, as I will also show. \nTake setting the pure rate of time preference equal to zero. The first \nthing to note is that such a proposal is inconsistent with current savings \nbehaviour. Applying such a low rate of discount for policies to maximise \nsocial welfare would imply far more public investment and would require \na far higher savings rate than is actually prevalent in any existing country \n(IPCC 1996b, p. 133).10 The second thing to note is that while it is true that \nfuture generations are not present in today\u2019s markets, the actual rate of \ndiscount used by the present generation does not violate the sustainability \nconstraint (at least non-declining welfare over time) if consumption is ris-\ning over time. If future generations were around and could reveal their \npreferences in today\u2019s markets, investment into man-made capital would \nbe higher, the real rate of return to investment and hence the discount rate \nwould be lower and consumption would rise still faster over time. But \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n19 \ngiven the validity of perfect substitutability, there is no justification to \nlower the rate of discount for reasons of sustainability if non-declining \nutility is already ensured by the actual rate of discount. The third thing to \nnote, related to the last point, is that the proposal to lower the rate of dis-\ncount is, somewhat surprisingly at first sight, contestable on ethical \ngrounds as well. The reason is as follows: Even with a conservative esti-\nmate for \nC\nC\n\u22c5\n of 1.5%, future generations will be almost 4.5 times better off \n100 years from now. Even if the costs of global warming by that time were, \nsay, 50% of GNP, a future generation 100 years hence will still be 2.25 \ntimes better off than the present generation. If that is the case, then setting \nthe pure rate of time preference equal to zero and forcing the current gen-\neration to make more sacrifices for emission abatement than with a pure \nrate of time preference of, say, 3% is dubious for reasons of inter-\ngenerational fairness. As Lind (1995, p. 384) has put it: \n \nCan we justify current generations sacrificing 2-3% of GWP [Gross World \nProduct, E.N.] to increase the wealth of future generations who even after \ndeduction for the high damage scenario are 2-15 times richer than the pre-\nsent generation? The answer is clearly no on the basis of intergenerational \nequity, which must weigh in favour of the current generation. \n \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n20 \nIronically, given the validity of the \u2018perfect substitutability paradigm\u2019, \ninter-generational fairness instead of calling for a zero pure rate of time \npreference would rather call for quite a high pure rate of time preference. \nWhat about the argument of Azar and Sterner (1996)? Here things are \nsomewhat different. If we discount future values because they accrue to \nricher people in the future then it is consistent to count values that accrue \nto the future intra-generational poor differently from those that accrue to \nthe rich. With global warming, there will be winners and losers and it \ncould be argued that the future beneficiaries of emission abatement are \nmainly located in some of the future developing countries whereas those \nwho are likely to undertake the abatement investments are mostly located \nin the present developed countries. Furthermore it could be argued that \ndue to this difference in location the future beneficiaries will not be better \noff (very much) than the current people asked to undertake sacrifices: \nEven if the now poor will be, say, 4.5 times better off in 100 years they will \nnot be much better off, if at all, than the currently rich. Hence it would fol-\nlow that, given a zero pure rate of time preference, the discount rate \nshould be equal to 0% or only slightly above. It might even be negative! \nAzar and Sterner\u2019s (1996) reasoning is consistent with the spirit of the \nRamsey-formula. But it still leads to inconsistent conclusions and ineffi-\ncient choices. Their reasoning is inconsistent with the actual provision of \naid from the current rich to the current poor which is of a rather limited \nmagnitude.11 As Schelling (1995, p. 397) has put it: \n \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n21 \nIt would be strange to forgo a per cent or two of GNP for 50 years for the \nbenefit of Indians, Chinese, Indonesians and others who will be living 50 \nto 100 years from now \u2014 and probably much better off than today\u2019s Indi-\nans, Chinese, and Indonesians \u2014 and not a tenth of that amount to in-\ncrease the consumption of contemporary Indians, Chinese, and Indone-\nsians. \n \nBut such a policy would also be hugely inefficient, even if the current \nrich were ready to make large sacrifices for the sake of people living in \ndeveloping countries either now or in the future. Given perfect substitut-\nability, there are many much more attractive investment options from the \nviewpoint of the beneficiaries than investing in emission abatement. As \nNordhaus (1991b, p. 57) notes, real rates of return to investment into edu-\ncation are extraordinarily high in poor countries: somewhere in the region \nof 26% for primary education, 16% for secondary and 13% for higher edu-\ncation. No doubt, poor people would be much better off if scarce finance \nwas invested in these opportunities rather than in combating global \nwarming. Given perfect substitutability, Schelling (1995, p. 401) is right in \nexpecting that \u201eif offered a choice of immediate development assistance or \nequivalent investments in carbon abatement, potential aid recipients \nwould elect for the immediate\u201c \u2014 as would their future descendants if \nthey had a voice. \n \n \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n22 \n4. The real issue: substitutability of natural capital \n \nThe problem with all these propositions to lower the discount rate is that \nthey do not attack the real problem with Nordhaus\u2019s methodology, \nnamely the underlying assumption of perfect substitutability. Given this \nassumption, lowering the discount rate to justify large-scale emission \nabatement is either ethically dubious because future generations are better \noff than the present generation anyway and inconsistent with the ob-\nserved magnitude of current savings, or it is inconsistent with the behav-\niour of the currently rich towards the currently poor and imposes upon \nthe poor inefficient investments whose financial resources they would \nrather use for different purposes if given a choice. Any call for more strin-\ngent emission abatement must therefore directly address the question of \nsubstitutability and assume, implicitly or explicitly, that man-made capital \nand natural capital are less than perfect substitutes. This is because substi-\ntutability is the implicit underlying theoretical foundation for discounting. \nThere have been some proposals in the literature to treat environ-\nmental costs and benefits differently from other values. One is the so-\ncalled Krutilla-Fisher-approach. Krutilla and Fisher (1975) presume that \nenvironmental benefits are likely to increase relative to other benefits in the \neconomy \u2014 for example because future richer people will appreciate rela-\ntively more environmental amenities if the income elasticity of environ-\nmental appreciation is bigger than one (the environment as a superior \ngood). De facto, this increase in relative value means that environmental \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n23 \nbenefits are discounted at less than other values or maybe even not at all. \nIf the relative importance of environmental benefits grew sufficiently \nstrong, they could even count more than their nominal value so that, de \nfacto, they would be \u2018discounted\u2019 at a negative rate. Krutilla and Fisher \nalso presume that some of the benefits from environmental destruction are \nlikely to depreciate over time. The developmental benefits from dam con-\nstruction, e.g., are likely to depreciate over time as superior technologies \nbecome available. De facto, this depreciation in relative value means that \nthese benefits are discounted heavier than other, especially environmental, \nvalues. Note the words de facto: Formally, the same uniform discount rate \nis applied to all values, it is rather the values that appreciate or depreciate, \nrespectively, before they are uniformly discounted to present values. \nThat the relative value of environmental goods might be rising over \ntime has found the approval of the leading economist experts on global \nwarming \u2014 see IPCC (1996b, p. 130). Recently, Rabl (1996) has applied the \nKrutilla-Fisher rationale to global warming under the presumption that \nthe environmental benefits of combating global warming are likely to rise \nover time. Similarly, but without recourse to the Krutilla-Fisher approach, \nTol (1994) examines the effect of letting intangible goods whose value in-\ncreases over time with per capita income enter the utility function. Not \nsurprisingly, Rabl and Tol find that higher emission abatement is war-\nranted than Nordhaus did. \nThe Krutilla-Fisher approach does not go a long way in departing from \nthe \u2018perfect substitutability paradigm\u2019, however. What it says is that envi-\nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n24 \nronmental and other values are still perfectly substitutable for each other, \nif only their value has been appreciated or depreciated beforehand. The \napproach does not attack the heart of the \u2018substitutability paradigm\u2019 there-\nfore. \nSuch an attack is undertaken by proponents of strong sustainability \u2014 \nnot surprisingly so given their belief in the \u2018complementarity paradigm\u2019. \nAt first glance the expected consequences of global warming seem to but-\ntress their view. This is because while not every effect of global warming \nwill be detrimental to natural capital and human health,12 a consensus is \nemerging (see IPCC 1995, pp. 28-36 and Environmental Protection Agency \n1997) that, for some regions at least, it will lead to or at least can lead to \n \n\u2022 a change in the species composition of forests with the possible loss \nof species and the disappearance of entire forestry types. \n\u2022 an increase in the frequency and the range of pests, pathogens and \nfires. \n\u2022 an increase in desertification and soil drying. \n\u2022 a disruption in mountain resources of food and fuel for indigenous \npeople. \n\u2022 an increase in the salinity of estuaries and freshwater aquifers and \nan increase in drinking water scarcity. \n\u2022 a disruption of saltwater marshes, mangrove ecosystems, coastal \nwetlands, coral reefs, coral atolls and river deltas due to, among oth-\ners, increased coastal flooding. \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n25 \n\u2022 an increase of heat waves with damaging effects on ecosystems and \nhuman health. \n\u2022 an exacerbation of air pollution and an increase in airborne pollens \nand spores that lead to increased incidences of respiratory disease, \nasthma, and allergic disorders. \n\u2022 an increase in the potential transmission of infectious diseases like \ncholera, malaria, encephalities, dengue and yellow fever. \n \nIn putting ecosystems under severe stress, global warming can there-\nfore damage the capacity of natural capital \n \n\u2022 to provide food, fibre, medicines and energy. \n\u2022 to process and store carbon and other nutrients. \n\u2022 to assimilate waste, purify water, and regulate water runoff. \n\u2022 to control floods, soil degradation and beach erosion. \n\u2022 to provide opportunities for recreation and tourism. \n \nSince natural capital as such should be kept intact, strong sustainability \ncalls for aggressive policies to combat global warming. While some warm-\ning might be unavoidable, strong sustainability would try to ensure that \nthe future is harmed as little as possible, even if it is materially better off \nthan the present. According to this view, global warming will degrade \nnatural capital and since natural capital cannot be substituted for, global \nwarming has to be prevented quite regardless of the costs of doing so.13 \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n26 \nNot surprisingly the position of the proponents of strong sustainability to \nundertake drastic action against global warming is shared by environmen-\ntalists (see for example Leggett 1990). Their position stands in marked con-\ntrast to Schelling\u2019s (1991, p. 221) belief that \u201eany disaster to developing \ncountries from climate change will be essentially a disaster to their eco-\nnomic development\u201c. \nBut is it really true that damages to natural capital cannot be compen-\nsated for? Proponents of aggressive emission abatement would have to \nshow that first adaptive behaviour cannot avoid these damages and sec-\nond individuals exhibit utility functions in which consumption and envi-\nronmental amenities are complements (since most damages relate to envi-\nronmental amenities which enter utility functions directly). As concerns \nthe first point, the already mentioned study by Mendelsohn and Neumann \n(1999) shows that adaptive behaviour can drastically reduce the expected \ndamages from global warming. To be fair, however, it has to be conceded \nthat neither this nor many other studies take into account health, aesthetic \nand nonmarket ecosystem impacts like species loss and loss of coastal wet-\nlands. As concerns the second point, the proponents of strong sustainabil-\nity would have to show that individuals have lexicographic preferences \nwith respect to environmental amenities, i.e. damage to environmental \namenities cannot be compensated for by consumption growth, however \nbig the increase. \nUnfortunately, there is hardly any reliable empirical evidence on this \npoint. To my knowledge, the only available evidence comes from some \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n27 \ncontingent valuation studies where minorities of interviewees have stated \nthat they want environmental amenities to be preserved whatever the cost \n\u2014 14% of the sample in Hanley and Milne (1996), 23% of the sample in \nSpash and Hanley (1995) and 24% in Stevens et al. (1991), to give some \nexamples. Given that the validity of these hypothetical surveys is highly \ncontested by many economists (e.g. Hausman 1993) and that, if at all, only \nminorities seem to exhibit preferences that can be interpreted as lexico-\ngraphic, one cannot infer that damage to environmental amenities and \nhuman health cannot be compensated for with consumption growth. \nMaybe because of this rather shaky evidence, some of the proponents \nof aggressive emission abatement seem to suggest therefore that the ques-\ntion of substitutability can be answered a priori. Barry (1991, p. 264) argues \nthat any environmental damage imposed on coming generations repre-\nsents a harm that is first unjustified and second not amenable to compen-\nsation: \n \nWe will all agree that doing harm is in general not cancelled out by doing \ngood, and conversely that doing some good does not license one to do \nharm provided it does not exceed the amount of good. For example, if you \npaid for the realignments of a dangerous highway intersection and saved \nan average of two lives a year, that would not mean that you could shoot \none motorist per year and simply reckon on coming out ahead. \n \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n28 \nSen (1982, p. 347) provides a similar line of reasoning. He regards \u2018last-\ning pollution\u2019 as a kind of oppression of future generations that cannot be \ncompensated for by increased material well-being: \n \nEven if the future generation may be richer and may enjoy a higher wel-\nfare level, and even if its marginal utility from the consumption gain is \naccepted to be less than the marginal welfare loss of the present genera-\ntion, this may still not be accepted to be decisive for rejecting the invest-\nment when the alternative implies long-term effects of environmental pol-\nlution. \n \nThe problem with such wide-ranging arguments is that there is a vir-\ntual infinity of actions of the present generation that affect the future and \noften the same action will have both beneficial and harmful aspects. The \nverdict that any action that inflicts some harm on coming generations is \nunjustified and cannot be compensated for calls for a virtual standstill in \neconomic actions of the present generation. Radical environmentalists \nmight be happy with such a scenario \u2014 but future generations will pre-\nsumably be less fond of it. The point is that not imposing any harm on the \nfuture carries with it a tremendous opportunity cost. The world we live in \nis full of trade-offs and decisions on how to cope with these trade-offs can \nsometimes be quite awkward. Simply ignoring the existence of these \ntrade-offs is not a viable position. \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n29 \nThis becomes clear in examining a further argument by Barry (1991, p. \n248) who states that \u201ewhile it is true that we do not know what the precise \ntastes of our remote descendants are, they are unlikely to include a desire \nfor skin cancer...\u201c. Whether this argument makes sense or not depends on \nwhat you mean by \u2018tastes\u2019. Surely, nobody has a desire for skin cancer as \nsuch, but whether future generations will accept an increase in the rate of \nskin cancer or not depends on what they get in exchange for it. Given the \nchoice between no change at all and a society with hugely increased con-\nsumption opportunities and increased life expectancies but a somewhat \nhigher chance to develop skin cancer at some age, I would not be too sure \nthat future generations would prefer the former option to the latter. \nIt is therefore not so much a question of whether doing harm can in \ngeneral be compensated by doing good, as Spash (1994) seems to suggest. \nTo a certain extent this must be possible or else we are doomed for inactiv-\nity. The real question is, again, whether large-scale damage to natural \ncapital caused by global warming can be compensated for by higher con-\nsumption levels or not. \n \n \n5. Conclusion \nIt was argued in this paper that the predominant critique of Nordhaus\u2019s \nmethodology leads to nonsensical conclusions if the underlying assump-\ntion of perfect substitutability is not addressed. Lind (1995, p. 384) is \nwrong in suggesting that \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n30 \n \nthe real disagreement between the environmentalists who advocate an all \nout programme to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and economists and \nothers who may be more sceptical, is a disagreement over (...) what the \nrate of per capita income growth will be and how severe the consequences \nof global warming will be. \n \nThe real disagreement is about the validity of the \u2018perfect substitutabil-\nity paradigm\u2019. The proponents of strong sustainability and the environ-\nmentalists regard the disturbance of the global atmospheric cycle as a \nharm to future generations that cannot be compensated for by higher con-\nsumption even if future generations are as much as 20 times materially \nbetter off. \nIf substitutability is the real issue, but discounting is not, what are the \nimplications for global warming? Weak sustainability calls for laissez-\nfaire, strong sustainability calls for aggressive abatement policy, but which \nparadigm of sustainability is \u2018correct\u2019? Answering this question is beyond \nthe scope of this paper, but Neumayer (1999, chapter 3) argues in detail \nthat neither paradigm of sustainability can be falsified under scientific \nstandards. As mentioned, there is hardly any reliable evidence on whether \nnatural and man-made capital are substitutes or complements in utility \nfunctions. Whether one believes in one paradigm or the other is ultimately \njust that: a matter of belief. Hence there is no clear-cut answer on what to \ndo with global warming. \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n31 \nIn spite of this ambiguity, however, a good case can be made for precau-\ntionary action towards global warming. The reasons are uncertainty and \nignorance about the likely future consequences of global warming. On the \nother hand, abating greenhouse emissions is costly. Channelling scarce \nfinancial resources into combating global warming drags them away from \nother investment opportunities and possibly even from other environ-\nmental protection measures. \nIt would be optimal therefore to do two things: Firstly, a lot more re-\nsearch should go into finding more empirical evidence on whether indi-\nviduals exhibit something close to lexicographic preferences with respect \nto environmental amenities or not \u2014 difficult as that might be. One should \nbeware not expecting too much from such research, however. This is be-\ncause proponents of strong sustainability seem to regard the question of \nsubstitutability more as a normative than a positive one. In other words, \nthey seem to believe that consumption growth should not be allowed to \ncompensate for damage to natural capital. Hence there might not be a lot \nto be gained from more research. Secondly therefore, and given the ambi-\nguity, it seems to be reasonable to realise those options first that protect \nthe environment at minimal, if any, economic costs. This would imply, as \nlaid down in more detail in Neumayer (1998), to establish and protect \nproperty rights, to abolish environmentally and economically harmful \nsubsidies, to substitute market-based for command-and-control instru-\nments, to use the revenues from environmental taxation such that their \neconomic costs are minimised and to help overcome obstacles for realising \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n32 \nself-paying efficiency improvements, especially in the energy sector. If \ncorrectly targeted, many of these measures would help to reduce emis-\nsions causing global warming substantially.14 \nIf the current generation still thinks that additional precautionary ac-\ntion is warranted, it should do so. Woodward and Bishop (1997) argue \nfrom an extension of the Arrow-Hurwicz (1972) framework that basing \nsuch a decision on the aversion against unlikely, yet catastrophic out-\ncomes can be a rational choice in dealing with uncertainty. Natural and \neconomic science is able to guide in making this decision transparent and \nrational. It will not be able to give the answer in the society\u2019s stead, how-\never. This is for two reasons: First, both the natural and economic science \nof global warming is unable to provide unambiguous answers about how \nmuch emission abatement is warranted. Uncertainty and ignorance are too \nwidespread. I cannot elaborate on this point here, but the short list of criti-\ncisms against Nordhaus\u2019s methodology I have provided above gives some \nhints. As Fankhauser (1993, p. 22), one of the leading experts on global \nwarming, has put it: \u201eThrough the choice of appropriate parameter values \nalmost any abatement policy can be justified\u201c. Second, the answers are \ndependent on the underlying ethical decisions concerning how much to \ntake the future welfare into account and whether one thinks that what fu-\nture generations care about is only total capital or specific sub-categories \nlike natural capital. Ultimately, it is on us to decide whether we think con-\nsumption growth can compensate future generations for damage to natu-\nral capital and human health or not. \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n33 \nIt is a mistake to believe that there is a quasi-scientific answer on what \nto do with global warming. Proponents of weak sustainability and strong \nsustainability should argue for their case and natural and economic sci-\nence can help in making the choices transparent and rational \u2014 as far as \nthat is possible. But how much abatement is warranted is ultimately de-\npendent on how risk-averse society is and which forms of capital it deems \nbest for future generations, if it wants to make any discrimination at all. \nThe question is rightly to be located within the political decision making \nprocess and should remain there. \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n34 \nReferences \n \nArrow, Kenneth J. and Leonid Hurwicz (1972).

Natural capital is then the totality of nature, i.e. resources, plants, species and \necosystems, that is capable of providing human beings with material and non-material \nflows of service. \n6 On page 10 of his book Nordhaus (1994) assures the reader that \u201eby consumption we \nmean a broad concept that includes not only traditional purchases of goods and services \nlike food and shelter but also non-market items such as leisure, cultural amenities, and \nenjoyment of the environment.\u201c This turns out to be an empty promise, however, since \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n46 \n                                                                                                                                     \non the following pages consumption is used in its traditional sense of consumption of \nmarketed goods and services. \n7 Note, however, that weak sustainability should be regarded as traditional neoclassical \neconomics (including cost-benefit analysis) plus the additional requirement to keep wel-\nfare non-declining over time. In that respect, weak sustainability would come to the \nsame conclusion as Nordhaus does. \n8 Of course, the estimates about harm caused by global warming might be significantly \nwrong. Although its likelihood is very small, there is the possibility of a run-away cli-\nmate catastrophe with dramatic damages if warming becomes extremely high (IPCC \n1996b, p. 207f.). Alternatively, although not likely, the future economy might grow at \nonly minimally positive rates or might even contract, as Woodward and Bishop (1995, p. \n105) seem to fear. Then the requirement to keep welfare non-declining over time in itself \nwould already call for some emission abatement. But currently best available guesses \nsuggest that this is not the case. \n9 Note the following caveat, however: observable real rates of return to investment might \nbe high because the economy is non-optimally managed. In particular, major environ-\nmental externalities might not be optimally internalised. The social discount rate should \ntake these externalities into account, however. Hence the social discount rate would be \nlower than the private real rate of return to investment. \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n47 \n                                                                                                                                     \n10 My guess is that the advocates of setting the pure rate of time preference equal to zero \nif confronted with this argument would retort that policies to boost savings and public \ninvestment should be undertaken to maximise social welfare. \n11 Again, I would guess that Azar and Sterner (1996) would demand to raise this level of \naid so as to maximise world social welfare, if only to remain consistent with their own \napproach. \n12 Warmer temperatures, for example, will mean reduced deaths from cold-related haz-\nards which might be bigger in size than the increased deaths from heat waves (I am \nthankful to an anonymous referee for this suggestion). More generally, individuals seem \nto prefer, ceteris paribus, warmer climates as can be seen by the fact that many retired \npeople in the United States move to the country\u2019s Southern parts. \n13 Unfortunately, the proponents of strong sustainability are not very clear on the question \nof discounting. Sometimes they seem to suggest abandoning discounting for certain so-\ncial decisions (Daly and Cobb 1989, p. 155; Daly 1992, p. 142), but mostly they do not \nbelieve in adjusting discount rates for the benefit of the future and prefer \u201ethe more di-\nrect approach of guaranteeing sustainability by means of quantitative limits and safe \nminimum standards\u201c (Daly and Cobb 1989, p. 152). \n14 This recommendation falls well short of the demands from the proponents of strong \nsustainability, but it is reaching further than the concensus \u2018Economists\u2019 statement on \nEnergy Policy Substitutability, not discounting, is the issue. \n48 \n                                                                                                                                     \nclimate change\u2019 (Hinrichs 1997) that was endorsed by over 2000 economists including \nWilliam Nordhaus, Robert Solow and five other Nobel Laureates shortly before the \nUnited Nations\u2019 Environment Conference in New York in June 1997. And it is more \nradical than the community of nation-states could agree upon in the follow-up confer-\nence to Rio in Kyoto in December 1997.
