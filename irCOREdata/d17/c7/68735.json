Introduction\n[2] Corotating interaction regions (CIRs) created by the\ninteraction between fast and slow solar wind streams are\nknown to cause magnetic storms that are distinct from those\nproduced by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Unlike the\nCME-driven disturbances, the CIR-driven storms do not\nproduce a particularly strong ring current and show rela-\ntively mild reductions in Dst index (typically Dst remains\nabove \u0002100 nT). However, the CIR-driven storms can\ngenerate other magnetospheric phenomena that are typical\nfor the magnetic storms such as relativistic particle energi-\nzation and precipitation, ionospheric heating, and enhanced\nconvection [e.g., Tsurutani et al., 2006a]. While the dura-\ntion of CME-driven storms typically does not exceed tens of\nhours, the CIR-driven storms can persist for a number of\ndays. Consequently, the energy input into the magneto-\nsphere during CIR-driven events can be comparable to, or\neven greater than, the energy input during CME-driven\nevents [e.g., Turner et al., 2006].\n[3] Borovsky and Denton [2006] outlined the main differ-\nences between CIR- and CME-driven events and pointed\nout that CIR-driven storms are characterized by longer\nperiods of the enhanced magnetospheric convection, even\nthough the peak convection speed can be higher for CME-\ndriven events. The enhanced magnetospheric convection is\nknown to be associated with plasmaspheric drainage plumes\nthat are observed in the dayside magnetosphere during both\nCME- and CIR-driven storms [Thomsen et al., 1998;\nBorovsky et al., 1998]. Ionospheric anomaly known as the\ntongue of ionization which spreads from middle to high\nlatitude and over to the polar cap during the main phase of\nmagnetic storms is believed to be linked to the plasma-\nspheric drainage plumes [Su et al., 2001; Foster et al.,\n2004]. Formation of the tongue of ionization and the\nmidlatitude ionospheric anomaly (also known as storm\nenhanced density (SED) anomaly) during major CME-\ndriven storms has been extensively studied using combina-\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 114, A12311, doi:10.1029\/2009JA014216, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of\nBath, Bath, UK.\n2Physics Department, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, New\nBrunswick, Canada.\n3Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Western Ontario,\nLondon, Ontario, Canada.\n4Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University,\nLancaster, UK.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/09\/2009JA014216$09.00\nA12311 1 of 8\ntions of the data of ionospheric GPS tomography, low Earth\norbit (LEO) spacecraft, and incoherent scatter radars [Foster\net al., 2005; Spencer and Mitchell, 2007; Pokhotelov et al.,\n2008] as well as numerical modeling [Sojka et al., 1998;\nCrowley et al., 2006]. Since CIR-driven storms are accom-\npanied by long periods of enhanced convection and iono-\nspheric heating it is reasonable to expect intense ionospheric\nanomalies such as the SED anomaly and the tongue of\nionization to appear. The recent study by Denton et al.\n[2009] using a superposed epoch analysis of data from a\nsingle ionosonde during CIR-driven storms reveals clear,\nrepeatable behavior in the midlatitude ionosphere (increase\nin hmF2) from the CIR onset for a period of at least 4 days.\nHowever, a detailed comparison between the ionospheric\nanomalies induced by CME- and CIR-driven storms has not\nbeen yet performed. This paper will focus on the iono-\nspheric anomalies induced by one of CIR-driven storms at\nmiddle and high latitudes and particularly in the polar cap\nregion.\n[4] In order to reveal the ionospheric anomalies occurring\non a global scale, such as the tongue of ionization and the\nmidlatitude SED anomaly, it is convenient to utilize iono-\nspheric GPS tomography which combines observations of\ntotal electron content (TEC) along multiple ray paths of\nGPS signals received by a network of ground-based GPS\nreceivers. Since the network of GPS receivers is sparse and\nnonuniform at high latitudes, it is preferable to combine the\ntomographic reconstructions with other data. In this study\nthe data from one of the Canadian Advanced Digital\nIonosondes (CADI) located at Eureka station near the\ngeomagnetic North Pole will be used as an example. We\nwill focus on ionospheric anomalies caused by the CIR-\ndriven storm that occurred during 14\u201317 October 2002.\n[5] Since 2002 the spatial coverage of observational\nnetwork in the polar cap region has been significantly\nimproved with a number of GPS receivers and digital\nionosondes deployed in the Arctic in 2007\u20132009 as a part\nof the Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN)\n[Jayachandran et al., 2009]. This study is partly motivated\nby the intention to analyze polar cap dynamics by assimi-\nlating the data from a network of digital ionosondes and the\nionospheric GPS tomography.\n2. CIR-Driven Storm of 14\u201317 October 2002\n[6] The moderate geomagnetic storm which took place on\n14\u201317 October 2002 is used in this study as an example of\nCIR-driven event. This storm has been identified as CIR-\ndriven by Zhang et al. [2007] who analyzed interplanetary\nand solar conditions for a number of geomagnetic storms\nthat occurred in years 1996\u20132005. Solar wind data from\nACE spacecraft as well as auroral and equatorial geomag-\nnetic indices for the period 13\u201317 October 2002 are\npresented in Figure 1. Over this period the solar wind\nvelocity gradually increases from 300 to 600 km\/s and the\ninterplanetary magnetic field (IMF) BZ component shows\noscillatory behavior typical for CIR-driven storms which is\nusually attributed to the effects of interplanetary Alfve\u00b4n\nwaves [Tsurutani et al., 2006a; Richardson et al., 2006].\n[7] As is typical for CIR-driven events this magnetic\nstorm produces only a moderate equatorial signature with\nthe Dst index reaching \u0002100 nT at 1400 UT on 14 October\n2002 and two less pronounced Dst minima occurring on 15\nand 16 October. The storm is accompanied by high levels\n(over 1000 nT) of the auroral electrojet (AE) index which\nare also common for CIR-driven storms [Tsurutani and\nGonzales, 1987]. Peaks of the AE index appear to correlate\nwith the dips of Dst index, increases in solar wind density\nand southward IMF turnings suggesting that the high levels\nof AE are related to the development of the CIR-storm\nrather than a series of substorm events. This interpretation,\nparticularly on 15\u201316 October, is also supported by (1)\nanalysis of magnetometer data from GOES spacecraft at\ngeosynchronous orbit where signatures of dipolarizations\nare largely absent, and (2) energetic particle data from\nLANL satellites and auroral oval images from Polar EUV\nwhich indicate the absence of repeated substorm activity\n(figures not shown).\n3. Tomographic Reconstructions\n[8] The ionospheric GPS tomography [e.g., Bust and\nMitchell, 2008] is based on reconstructing an image of the\nionospheric plasma from multiple rays of microwave GPS\nsignals. While passing through the dispersive ionosphere\nthe GPS signals suffer a phase advance and a group delay\nwhich is proportional to the total electron content (TEC)\nalong the signal path. The TEC is defined as the number of\nelectrons in a column of unit cross-sectional area along the\npath between a satellite and a receiver. Once values of the\nslant TEC are known along each signal path, the tomo-\ngraphic inversion can be performed to get a three-dimensional\n(3-D) distribution of the ionospheric plasma density.\nVertical TEC, defined as the number of electrons in a\nvertical column of unit area, can be derived by integrating\nthrough the reconstructed 3-D density distribution.\n[9] In this study the 4-D (3-D plus time) inversion\nalgorithm known as Multi-Instrument Data Analysis System\n[Mitchell and Spencer, 2003; Spencer and Mitchell, 2007]\nhas been applied to create tomographic images of the\nionospheric plasma. A Kalman filter approach is utilized\nin this algorithm to accommodate temporal changes in the\nionospheric plasma density using the statistical Weimer\nconvection model [Weimer, 1995] to project the ionospheric\nimages forward in time. TEC data from 51 International\nGNSS Service (IGS) dual-frequency GPS receivers distrib-\nuted over the Northern Hemisphere have been used to\nobtain the ionospheric TEC. Approximate locations of the\nGPS receivers are shown in Figures 2 and 3 by red labels\nwith four-symbol code indicating the names of IGS stations.\n[10] Figure 2 shows distributions of the ionospheric TEC\nover a large portion of the Northern Hemisphere obtained at\n0800 and 0900UTon 14October 2002. The colormaps indicate\nthe magnitude of vertical TEC (1 TEC unit = 1016 el\/m2).\nFor comparison, the TEC distribution obtained during rela-\ntively quiet prestorm day of 13 October 2002 at 0800 UT is\nshown in Figure 4 (left). Increased TEC values seen during the\nstorm at middle latitudes on the dayside (over Europe and\nRussia) are believed to be caused partly by the solar radiation\nand partly by various mechanisms responsible for the forma-\ntion of the storm enhanced density (SED) anomaly. Such\nmechanisms may include plasma uplift due to expanded\nelectric convection or thermospheric neutral winds and\nchanges in the ionospheric composition [e.g., Crowley et al.,\nA12311 POKHOTELOV ET AL.: IONOSPHERIC RESPONSE TO CIR STORM\n2 of 8\nA12311\n2006]. Northward of the midlatitude SED anomaly the tongue\nof ionization is carried antisunward by the ionospheric con-\nvection across the polar cap into the night side North American\nsector. Plot times for Figure 2 were chosen (approximately)\nwhen the highest TEC values were observed in the polar cap\nwhich happened a few hours before the Dst index reaches its\nminimum on 14 October. Similarly, for large CME-driven\nstorms the highest TEC values in the tongue of ionization are\nobserved few hours prior to theDstminimum [e.g., Pokhotelov\net al., 2008].\n[11] On 15 October 2002 TEC anomalies at middle and\nhigh latitudes also appear prior to the Dst minimum though\nthe tongue of ionization is relatively less pronounced (those\nreconstructions are not presented here). This study will\nmainly focus on the sequence of tomographic reconstruc-\ntions for 16 October 2002 which is shown in Figure 3. For\ncomparison, the TEC distribution obtained during quiet\nprestorm day of 13 October 2002 at 1950 UT is shown in\nFigure 4 (right). Again, the midlatitude SED anomaly\nappearing during the storm on the dayside (over the main-\nland United States of America and southern Canada) is\nbelieved to be due to the solar radiation and the above\nmentioned SED mechanisms. The magnitude of the\nmidlatitude anomaly is substantially higher relative to\nthe 14 October anomaly suggesting that the mechanisms\nresponsible for the SED formations are more intense (see\nsection 5). At 1750 UT (top left plot in Figure 3) we can see\nthe tongue of ionization starting to form over the Hudson\nBay area. This moment is manifested by the southward\nturning of IMF (see Figure 1). Analysis of the Super Dual\nFigure 1. Interplanetary magnetic field (BZ component in GSM coordinates), solar wind velocity and\ndensity, auroral electrojet (AE) and equatorial electrojet (Dst) indices during 14\u201317 October 2002\nmagnetic storm.\nA12311 POKHOTELOV ET AL.: IONOSPHERIC RESPONSE TO CIR STORM\n3 of 8\nA12311\nAuroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) convection maps\n(available at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics\nLaboratory website) for this day shows that the ionospheric\nconvection is globally enhanced after 1740 UT with the\ncross polar cap potential jumping from 43 to 74 kV between\n1730 and 1740 UT. This convection enhancement will be\nfurther examined in section 4 using digital ionosonde data.\nThe next tomographic image in Figure 3 taken at 1850 UT\n(top right plot) shows the tongue of ionization reaching the\narea of the geomagnetic north pole. At 1950 UT (bottom left\nplot) the tongue of ionization reaches its peak magnitude\nand the 2040 UT image (bottom right plot) shows the\ntongue separating from the midlatitude TEC anomaly with\ndense plasma patches still drifting antisunward over the\nnorthern tip of Greenland.\n4. Comparison With CADI Data\n[12] The Canadian Advanced Digital Ionosondes\n(CADIs) are able to produce conventional ionograms as\nwell as to derive velocity and direction of the ionospheric\ndrifts from the fixed frequency Doppler measurements with\ntemporal resolution of 30 s [MacDougall and Jayachandran,\n2001]. Six CADI ionosondes are now deployed (or about to\nbe deployed) in the Canadian Arctic as a part of the CHAIN\nnetwork. In this study CADI ionosonde data from Eureka\nstation (80\u0002N 274\u0002E) located at Ellesmere Island near the\ngeomagnetic north pole will be used to analyze the iono-\nspheric anomalies revealed by the GPS tomography on\n16 October 2002. The location of the Eureka station is\nindicated by a white cross in Figure 3.\n[13] Figure 5 presents a fixed frequency plot for Eureka\nstation showing the virtual height of the F layer at the\nfrequency of 4.2 MHz as well as velocity (horizontal and\nvertical) and azimuth of the ionospheric convection flow.\nDashed vertical lines in Figure 5 indicate the moments when\nfour tomographic images shown in Figure 3 were taken. It is\nclearly seen that the convection changed abruptly around\n1740 UT when the velocity jumped from \u0003250 to 1000 m\/s\nwith the convection flow directed northward, i.e., approx-\nimately antisunward. This change in the convection corre-\nsponds to the moment when the tongue of ionization starts\nto form according to the GPS tomography (see top left plot\nin Figure 3).\n[14] Fixed frequency CADI plot (Figure 5 (top)) indicates\na passage of a few ionospheric inhomogeneities\/patches\nuntil 1850 UT when the F layer becomes dense and\nuniform. This corresponds to the moment when the tongue\nof ionization reaches Eureka station as shown by the\ntomographic image in top right plot of Figure 3. The\npassage of the uniform and dense tongue of ionization over\nEureka at 1950 UT is illustrated by the tomographic image\nin the bottom left plot of Figure 3. While the tomographic\nimages presented here are merely snapshots, the analysis of\nanimated sequence of images (produced with 10 min\nresolution) shows uniform flow of dense plasma over the\nEureka station between 1850 and 2040 UT. According to\nthe CADI data, the uniform ionospheric tongue passes over\nEureka until about 2040 UT when the F layer becomes\nhighly inhomogeneous. This corresponds to the moment\nwhen the tongue of ionization transforms into large-scale\npatches separated from the midlatitude TEC anomaly as\nshown by the tomographic image in the bottom right plot of\nFigure 3. It has to be pointed out that the 2040 UT\ntomographic image shown in Figure 3 actually refers to\nthe 10 min time interval centered around 2040 UT, and thus,\nthe reduction of TEC over Eureka seen in the image\nFigure 2.

Discussion\n[15] It appears that the CIR-driven magnetic storm of\nmoderate Dst magnitude from \u0002100 to \u000250 nT analyzed\nabove is capable of producing large TEC anomalies (up to\n80 TEC units) at middle latitudes and in the polar cap\nregion. For comparison, the tongues of ionization with\nplasma contents around 100 TEC units are seen in the polar\ncap during major CME-driven storms with Dst magnitudes\nof \u0003\u0002400 nT such as 30 October and 20 November 2003\nsuperstorms. It raises the question whether the Dst index\ncan be used as a reasonable measure to predict the intensity\nof storm-induced ionospheric anomalies without taking into\naccount solar and interplanetary origins of the storm.\nObviously, comprehensive analysis of the ionospheric\nFigure 3.

Early studies of the\nplasmaspheric contribution using comparison between\nGPS-observed TEC values and TEC values derived from\nradio signals transmitted by Navy Ionospheric Monitoring\nSystem (1100 km LEO orbit) spacecraft [Lunt et al., 1999a]\nas well as ray tracing of the GPS signals through the\nnumerical model of the plasmasphere [Lunt et al., 1999b]\nFigure 4.

Three bottom panels show azimuth and two components (horizontal\nand vertical) of the ionospheric convection flow. Dashed vertical lines indicate time moments\ncorresponding to the tomographic images in Figure 3.\nA12311 POKHOTELOV ET AL.: IONOSPHERIC RESPONSE TO CIR STORM\n6 of 8\nA12311\nsuggested that under quiet geomagnetic conditions the\nplasmasphere does not contribute more than a few TEC\nunits at middle latitudes. However, data from the upward\nlooking GPS antenna on board the CHAMP spacecraft\n(\u0003400 km LEO orbit) obtained during 30 October 2003\n[Mannucci et al., 2005] and 20 November 2003 [Yizengaw\net al., 2006] superstorms suggested that the storm time\nplasma content above the CHAMP orbit may exceed 20\u2013\n30 TEC units for middle- and high-latitude regions. Tomo-\ngraphic reconstructions presented in the current paper\naccount for the range of altitudes up to 1600 km, and\nconsequently, GPS observations on LEO orbits higher than\nthe CHAMP orbit are needed to estimate the topside plasma\ncontribution correctly. The upcoming Canadian CASSIOPE\/\nE-POP mission (1500 km apogee LEO orbit) with four\nupward looking GPS antennas is expected to resolve this\nproblem.\n[17] The peak magnitude of TEC anomalies observed\nduring 14\u201317 October 2002 storm is substantially greater\non 16 October compared to 14 October and 15 October even\nthough 16 October has the weakest Dst signature. This\napplies to the anomalies occurring at auroral latitudes and in\nthe polar cap as well as the mid-latitude SED anomaly seen\nover the US Mainland. A possible explanation is that the\nionosphere on 16 October has been preconditioned by the\nenergy deposition (via Joule heating and particle precipita-\ntions) during the previous two days of the storm, thus\nmaking it easier for the anomalies to form once the iono-\nspheric convection is enhanced on 16 October. Larger TEC\nmagnitudes could also be attributed to the higher values of\nsolar wind speed on 16 October as the solar wind speed\nexceeds 600 km\/s at 1800\u20132000 UT on 16 October com-\nparing to \u0003300 km\/s at 0800\u20130900 UT on 14 October.\nHigher solar wind speed ultimately leads to faster plasma\ntransport across the polar cap, thus giving ionospheric\nplasma less time to recombine and producing higher TEC\nvalues. Corresponding values of the antisunward plasmas\nconvection flow in the polar cap retrieved from the Weimer\nconvection model (used in the tomographic reconstructions\npresented earlier) are 800\u2013900 m\/s at 1800\u20132000 UT on\n16 October and 500\u2013600 m\/s at 0800\u20130900 UT on\n14 October. It is worth mentioning that the sharp\nincrease in high-latitude plasma convection around\n1740 UT on 16 October (seen in CADI drift data in\nFigure 5) which triggers the formation of high-latitude\nanomaly seems to be initiated by the sharp southward\nturning of IMF at 1720 UT. Presumably, the southward\nturning of IMF under high solar wind speed conditions\nfacilitates the rapid entry of plasma into the polar cap, thus\ncreating the tongue of ionization. This seems to be consis-\ntent with the case described by Tsurutani et al. [2006b] for\n3 January 2003 CIR-driven event where the high-latitude\nTEC anomaly is formed in few hours following the sharp\nCIR-induced southward IMF turning [see Tsurutani et al.,\n2006b, Figure 8]. A comparative analysis of a number of\nCIR- and CME-driven storms using some form of the solar\nwind\u2013magnetosphere coupling function [e.g., Gonzalez,\n1990] may help to understand the geoeffectiveness of\nvarious solar wind parameters (namely, solar wind speed\nand IMF Bz). Such analysis has been recently presented by\nMannucci et al. [2008] for few major CME-driven storms\nbut has yet to be performed for CIR-driven storms.\n[18] The morphology of the TEC anomalies observed in\nthe polar cap during 1400\u20131700 October 2002 storm\nresembles the anomalies observed during major CME-\ndriven storms with the SED anomaly appearing at midlat-\nitudes and the tongue of ionization extending into the polar\ncap. The period over which the tongue of ionization persists\nas a relatively uniform anomaly spreading from midlatitude\nto the geomagnetic pole lasts for \u00032 h after which the\ntongue separates from the midlatitude anomaly forming\nlarge-scale drifting patches. This is similar to the time scales\nof the anomalies that are evolving in the polar cap during\nmajor CME-driven storms [Spencer and Mitchell, 2007;\nPokhotelov et al., 2008].\n[19] Comparison between the tomographic reconstruc-\ntions and the measurements of ionospheric convection by\nthe CADI ionosonde in Eureka and SuperDARN radars\nsuggests that the formation of the tongue of ionization on 16\nOctober is triggered by sudden increase in the convection\nwhich presumably allows plasma to be transported quickly\nfrom midlatitude into the polar cap region. It needs to be\npointed out that the tomographic reconstructions presented\nin this study rely to a certain extent on the Kalman filter\ntechnique utilizing the statistical Weimer model as a proxy\nfor the global ionospheric convection. The use of convec-\ntion data from a network of ionosondes (such as CHAIN)\nand\/or SuperDARN HF radars should improve the quality\nof reconstructions in the polar cap. The question to which\nextent the plasma composing the tongue of ionization is\ntransported from lower latitudes or created locally by the\nenhanced electric fields and\/or thermospheric winds is not\naddressed in this study and needs to be investigated using\ndata assimilation [e.g., Bust and Crowley, 2007].\n[20] While the comparison between TEC reconstructions\nand CADI ionosonde observations of the virtual F layer\nheight over Eureka shows good qualitative agreement, the\nquestion still remains regarding how well the GPS tomog-\nraphy can reproduce the actual values of plasma density at\ngiven locations, particularly far away from the nearest\nground-based GPS receiver. In order to assess quantitatively\nthe performance of tomographic algorithms, one would\nhave to compare the values of F peak plasma density\nmeasured by ionosondes with the density values obtained\nfrom the tomographic 3-D reconstructions. Such quantita-\ntive comparison for the 16 October 2002 event has been\nperformed using CADI observations at Eureka and will be\ndescribed in details in a separate article (D. Pokhotelov P. T.\nJayachandran, C. N. Mitchell, J. W. MacDougall, and M. H.\nDenton, GPS tomography in the polar cap: comparison with\nionosondes and in-situ spacecraft data, submitted to GPS\nSolutions, 2009). In brief summary, vertical density profiles\nover Eureka station obtained from the tomographic 3-D\nreconstructions reproduce well the dynamics of the F peak\ndensity measured by the CADI ionosonde, though the GPS\ntomography tends to underestimate the F peak density by\n20\u201330%. Quantitative comparison of the tomographic\nreconstructions with in situ spacecraft measurements of cold\nplasma obtained by the DMSP Special Sensors-Ions, Elec-\ntrons, and Scintillation thermal plasma analysis instruments\nA12311 POKHOTELOV ET AL.: IONOSPHERIC RESPONSE TO CIR STORM\n7 of 8\nA12311\nwill also be presented by D. Pokhotelov et al. (submitted\nmanuscript, 2009).\n6. Conclusions\n[21] The analysis of ionospheric response to the CIR-\ndriven storm of 14\u201317 October 2002 suggests that the\nionospheric anomalies induced by this storm are compara-\nble to the ionospheric anomalies induced by CME-driven\nstorms of much greater Dst magnitude. Tomographic 4-D\nreconstructions of the ionospheric plasma density using\nmeasurements of the total electron content along ray paths\nof GPS signals reveal the morphology and dynamics of\nstorm-induced plasma anomalies at middle and high lati-\ntudes that are similar to the ionospheric anomalies produced\nby major CME-driven storms with the SED anomaly forming\nin the dayside midlatitude ionosphere and the tongue of\nionization spreading into the polar cap region. Analysis of\nthe CADI ionosonde observations obtained at Eureka station\nnear the geomagnetic north pole shows remarkably good\nagreement with the dynamics of high-latitude ionospheric\nanomalies revealed by the GPS tomography with the CADI\nionosonde data showing a passage of the tongue of ionization\nand patches over the Eureka station at the same moments as\ntomographic images. This outlines potential benefits of\nintercomparison between the tomographic reconstructions\nand observations by the network of digital ionosondes\n(e.g., CHAIN). Quantitative comparison between plasma\ndensities observed by CADI ionosondes and those obtained\nby the GPS tomography will be presented in a separate article\n(D. Pokhotelov et al., submitted manuscript, 2009).\n[22] Acknowledgments.
