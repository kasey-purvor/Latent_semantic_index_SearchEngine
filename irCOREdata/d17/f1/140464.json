Introduction\nMechanical biological treatment (MBT) is widely adopted in mainland Europe for\ntreating residual municipal solid waste (MSW), (Juniper, 2005; Velis et al., in press) under\nEU Landfill Directive (Council of the European Union, 1999) requirements. MBT that\nemploys biodrying is also used to produce solid recovered fuel (SRF) (Velis et al., 2009), a\nrenewable alternative to fossil fuel, incorporating a high fraction of biogenic matter,\nrendering SRF carbon-neutral, in part. Biogenic matter, denoted \u03c7B, is defined as material\n\u201cproduced in natural processes by living organisms but not fossilised, or derived from fossil\nresources\u201d (European Committee for Standardisation, 2006a). An accurate, quality assured,\nmeasurement of \u03c7B in waste streams processed as SRF is important because the thermal\nrecovery of biogenic matter is renewable and carbon-neutral, qualifying for subsidies such as:\n(i) renewable energy certificates (ROCs) in the UK, and (ii) emissions trading schemes (e.g.,\nthe European emission trading scheme EU-ETS) respectively (Garg et al., 2007; Ofgem,\n2009; Velis et al., in press).\nThe requirements of these policy instruments have prompted a growing interest in\nanalytical methods for the determination of biogenic content (Fellner et al., 2007; Fellner and\nRechberger, 2009; Mohn et al., 2008; Staber et al., 2008) in wastes. The research efforts of\nthe European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) have progressed through the stages of: (i)\npre-normative research on standard development (Cuperus and van Dijk, 2002; Cuperus et\nal., 2005); (ii) the issue of a \u2018draft standard for development\u2019 (DD) (European Committee for\nStandardisation, 2006a; 2007); and (iii) validation of the DD methods through the\nQUOVADIS initiative (Gawlik et al., 2007; QUOVADIS, 2007). In the US, a simplistic\nmethodology using waste composition data has been proposed (Energy Information\nAdministration, 2007), and a 14C method has been recently standardised (ASTM, 2008).\n3Draft European standard CEN\/TS 15440:2006 on the determination of \u03c7B in SRF\n(European Committee for Standardisation, 2006a) offers analytical methods for the\ncharacterisation of waste tradable attributes. Many methods were considered for the\ndetermination of \u03c7B in SRF (Cuperus and van Dijk, 2002). The manual sorting method\n(MSM) and the selective dissolution method (SDM) were selected for development. The\nselective dissolution method relies on a feature of most biogenic materials: they dissolve and\nare oxidised more readily in acid mixtures; whereas non-biogenic matter remains intact and\ncan be recovered gravimetrically. By contrast, the manual sorting method relies on the\naccurate sorting of components of biogenic origin from the waste stream. The method\nestimates \u03c7B by assigning a fixed (deemed) value in each of 14 material categories (\u03c7B,i, i:\ncategory index) categories considering them \u2018homogenous\u2019 from a \u03c7B perspective (European\nCommittee for Standardisation, 2006a).\nUnsurprisingly, despite both methods offering surrogate estimates for \u03c7B, the SDM is\nconsidered the most accurate (Cuperus and van Dijk, 2002; Cuperus et al., 2005; Staber et al.,\n2008) and is used in several SRF production plants and\/or prior to thermal recovery. Though\nsimple, the MSM is time consuming (QUOVADIS, 2007) and labour-intensive (Fellner et al.,\n2007), and it embodies high levels of method uncertainty (Table 1). Nevertheless, manual\nsorting data could prove valuable to the optimisation of SRF-producing MBT plants, and may\nbe a cost-effective means of allocating the biogenic content of certain SRF end-uses, as\nrequired for regulatory oversight of carbon trading mechanisms (Ofgem, 2009).\n<insert Table 1. A qualitative comparison of SDM and MSM methods>\nThe QUOVADIS initiative undertook inter-laboratory comparisons of the MSM and SDM\nmethods and delivered important suggestions for modifying the draft standard (QUOVADIS,\n42007). Similar limited results were reported by Flamme (2006) \u2013 it is unclear if it is the same\nor different dataset. However, there remains scope for clarification on key aspects of the\nSDM and MSM, hence this research. For instance, the fines category introduces high levels\nof uncertainty into the estimation of \u03c7B by the MSM because of its variable composition, and\nsubstantial mass contribution to samples. This is evident for SRF, as most end-use\nspecifications demand its size reduction at <30-40 mm (Velis et al., in press). This was\nrecognised by QUOVADIS through its proposed amendment of the fixed value of \u03c7B fines from\n0% w\/wd in the draft standard (European Committee for Standardisation, 2006a) to 50% w\/wd\n(QUOVADIS, 2007). So far, no detailed scientifically robust data have been reported on\nhow the SDM and MSM correlate. Could a more detailed sorting into material categories\nsecure a better correlation? And how does the choice for estimating or \u2018deeming\u2019 the value\nof \u03c7B fines impact on this correlation?\nOur study set out to: (i) critically examine the assumed, but non-quantified, correlation\nbetween these two methods; (ii) in doing so, evaluate the required degree of detail in the\nsorting categories for the MSM; (iii) examine the effect of assigning a fixed value of \u03c7B for\nthe fines fraction, as opposed to its direct measurement by the SDM; and (iv) investigate the\napplication of these methods beyond SRF to a wider range of waste fractions encountered\nwithin MBT plants. Methodological complexities pertaining to the computation formulas\nproposed by CEN for the determination of biogenic content as \u2018pure biomass\u2019 are elaborated\nupon.\n2. Materials and methods\nAn overview of the methodological steps followed in this research, intended to help\nreaders conceptualise the sequence of steps and equipment used, is presented in Fig 1.\n<insert Fig. 1. Overview of methodological steps>\n52.1 Sampling\nSamples were collected from an SRF- producing MBT plant processing residual MSW.\nFrom the process flowsheet (Fig. 2), fifteen sampling points (SP) were identified, including\ninputs to the mechanical processing of MSW, all outputs, and intermediate process streams\n(Fig. 2). Sampling followed the theory of sampling (ToS) for heterogeneous solids (Gy,\n2004; Petersen et al., 2005) and the CEN requirements for SRF (European Committee for\nStandardisation, 2006b). Three increments (INC) (i.e., three series of fifteen process stream\nsamples) were used. The first two increments (INC1 and INC2) were fully analysed; with an\nadditional increment (INCad) used to quantify the moisture content (M) by material category,\nand the biogenic content of the fines fraction (\u03c7B_fines) at each process stream. These\nsampling choices enabled coverage for a range of MBT-related materials, including all pre-\nprocessing stages of the SRF output.\nSamples were stored in plastic bags in a refrigerated container (2\u00b12\u00b0C) until the entire on-\nsite sampling effort was completed (up to 28 d). Because the readily biodegradable material\nhad already decomposed during in the biodrying stage, the moisture lowered below moisture\nstress biodegradation inhibition level, and the sufficiently low storage temperature, no change\nin the biogenic content of the samples is anticipated to have occurred during this storage\nstage. The initial sample size (300\u201315,000 g) was defined by reference to the estimated\nheterogeneity of each process stream. Any differences in the sample mass between INCs for\neach SP, were corrected for by producing sub-samples using a riffle divider Retsch RT 75\n(Leeds, UK).\n<insert Fig. 2. Waste treatment plant process and sampling points>\n62.2 Manual sorting\nFor the manual sorting method, samples were sieved for the separation of fines and\nthen sorted into categories to obtain an \u2018as-received\u2019 (denoted ar) mass (g) at four decimal\nplace precision. Fines passed through a perforated surface of a sorting table (\u00f8 10 mm). The\nremaining material was manually separated into 24 identifiable categories (Table 2). This\nrepresented a detailed categorisation of each process stream, expanding beyond the 14\ncategories stipulated by CEN for \u03c7B by the MSM (European Committee for Standardisation,\n2006a). I t also supported a concurrent analysis of MBT process performance and materials\nflow through the plant.\n<insert Table 2. Categories into which process streams were sorted manually using the\nMSM>\nSamples from different process streams (SPs) produced varying recoveries of material\nby category (reflecting their stage of processing) and posed different sorting challenges.\nLarge items upstream of the secondary shredder (SP1, 16) contained fixed sub-components of\ndifferent categories: e.g., plastic and metal and hazardous items, such as printed circuit board.\nThese items were separated from one another manually or with scissors, as far as was\npossible. Conversely, waste fragments in process streams downstream of the secondary\nshredder are finely shredded to <40 mm (SP11-13, 15) and pose their own identification\ndifficulties; e.g., for fragments stemming from shoes, sanitary products, and composite\npackaging. Identifiable screws and nails in the fines were reassigned to the metal categories.\nFor each sample, the 16 shreddable waste component categories were remixed into a\nreassembled fraction (Table 2) whilst 8 non-shreddable categories (Table 2) were discarded,\nwhere the shredders could not tolerate substantial quantities of aggregates and metals. Where\nfines were constituted mainly of aggregates (SP3, 7, 15; Fig. 2), they were excluded from the\n7reassembled fraction as non-shreddable materials. Discarded fractions were accounted for in\nthe calculations of both MSM and SDM.\nTo investigate the influence of the level of detail in manual sorting and the approach\nto the estimation of the biogenic content of the fines <10 mm (\u03c7B_fines), the \u03c7B was calculated\nfor three different methodological variations (groupings, G) of the waste component\ncategories and\/or \u03c7B_fines using the INC1 and INC2 samples: (G1) the 24 detailed categories\n(Table 2), with \u03c7B_fines being inferred from the extra increment INCad by measurement,\napplying the selective dissolution method (see section 2.5); (G2) the manual sorting results\nre-grouped in the 14 DD CEN\/TS 15442:2006 categories (European Committee for\nStandardisation, 2006a), following specific re-grouping choices denoted in Table 3, and with\ndeemed \u03c7B of each category as proposed to be amended by QUOVADIS (QUOVADIS, 2007)\napart from the \u03c7B_fines, being inferred from the extra increment by SDM as in G1; and (G3) the\nsame 14 re-grouped categories as in G2, with \u03c7B_fines being prescribed and fixed at 50% w\/wd\n(QUOVADIS value).\n<insert Table 3. Grouped categories with commentary on potential impact on final results>\nBiogenic content \u03c7B on a dry mass basis was calculated using:\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf0e5\n\uf0e5 \uf0b4\n\uf03d\ni\ni\ni\nBii\nB massdry\nmassdry \uf063\n\uf063 Eq.1\nThe MSM was performed once on each of INC1 and INC2 in this study, allowing no\nestimation of repeatability. Manual sorting is extraordinarily lengthy and replication not\npracticable given the volumes and types of material considered.\nMoisture (MT) was measured in a two stages: bulk drying (24h, 40\u00b0C) (Mb in % w\/war);\nresidual drying (Mr in % w\/wb) (24h, 105\u00b0C), (European Committee for Standardisation,\n82006d). Total moisture was computed according the relevant CEN standard for SRF\n(European Committee for Standardisation, 2006c). The moisture of the individual waste\ncomponent categories was approximated. Ash content was measured in accordance with the\nDD CEN\/TS 15403:2006 for SRF samples. These are further detailed in Supplementary\nMaterial.\n2.3 Final general analysis sample preparation for the SDM\nFor the measurement of \u03c7B using the selective dissolution method, the reassembled\nfractions were sub-sampled in accord with the theory of sampling (Gerlach and Nocerino,\n2004; Nocerino et al., 2005). Samples from the process streams SP1, 16 were shredded to\n<40 mm passing them twice through a slow rotation rotary shear Rodan Engineering CS 3000\n(Stoke-on-Trent, UK). All samples were then bulk dried (40\u00b0C, 24 h) in advance of dry\nprocessing through a slow rotation cutting mill (RETSCH SM 2000, Leeds, UK) to <4 mm.\nWhere necessary, sample mass was homogenised and further reduced by sub-sampling\nthrough an A\/S Rationel Kornservice riffle divider (5 L, hinged container type 2, 18 splits;\nEsbjerg, Denmark), before shredding to <1 mm in a RETSCH ultra-centrifugal mill ZM200\n(12,000 rpm). These final general analysis samples (GAS) were then sub-sampled to 50-100\ng, and stored in air-tight bags at ambient temperature, in darkness. Grinding to a size of <1\nmm was thought as sufficient for the SDM. The QUOVADIS study indicates no significant\ndifference for \u03c7B between samples prepared at <1 and <0.5 mm (QUOVADIS, 2007).\n2.4 Selective dissolution (SDM)\nThe SDM was performed in triplicate following the DD CEN\/TS 15442:2006\n(European Committee for Standardisation, 2006a). Attempted improvements, which\nconstitute departures from the standard, and specific choices are explained.\n9For each replicate, an aliquot of 5 g from the GAS was weighed to 4 decimal places\ninto Erlenmeyer flasks. In a fume cupboard, 150 mL of 84% v\/v H2SO4 (prepared from >95%\nv\/v, analytical grade; Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) was added using a bottle\ndispenser. The slightly higher concentration than advised by the standard (78 % w\/w H2SO4)\nhas the advantage of being easily prepared from commercially available concentrations.\nHowever, a properly designed statistical experiment is necessary to establish that this\ndeparture from the standard method as proposed by CEN leads to fully equivalent results. As\na gross check, visual observation of the solid residue revealed no differences between these\ntwo versions.\nFlasks were gently stirred to impregnate the powder, and the mixture left to react for 16\nh under slight continuous agitation achieved using an IKA KS60 mechanical orbital shaker\n(50 rpm; Staufen, Germany). Hydrogen peroxide (35% v\/v analytical grade, Acros Organics,\nGeel, Belgium) was added in three 10 mL aliquots, separated by ca 10 min, whilst\nsubmerging flasks in a 3 cm deep cooling bath to control the reaction and avoid the\ndeposition of material on the flasks walls. Mixtures were digested for 5 h, before 300 mL\ndeionised water was added. The final mixture was filtered through a pre-weighed dried\nWhatman GF\/B \u00f8 90 mm glass microfibre filter (Maidstone, UK) into a B\u00fcchner funnel and\nrinsed with 400 mL of deionised water to a final pH of \u22653.0. Filters were dried at 105\u00b0C for\n24 h, weighed, and kept in air-tight plastic containers at ambient temperature.\n2.5 The reporting basis for \u03c7B and ash content\nBiogenic content \u03c7B determined by the selective dissolution method can be\nexpressed in a variety of ways, contingent on the specific uses and data demands. Draft\nstandard CEN\/TS 15442:2006 introduces the concept of \u2018pure biomass.\u2019 The proposed by\nCEN computation formula includes a series of corrections pertaining to the ash content. This\nis necessary because during the selective dissolution a non-negligible part of the ash of the\n10\nsample dissolves. This \u2018pure biomass\u2019 is referred to as being biomass on a dry basis\n(European Committee for Standardisation, 2006a). The relevant CEN\/TS formula is shown\nin Eq. 2, adapted for analysis performed only on the shreddable part of each sample.\nsamplefulld\nfractiondreassembledsampletestdb\nsampletestd\nfilterresidueashfillterresidued\ndpureB m\nmA\nm\nmm\n,\n,,\n,\n&&,\n,, 100\n1 \uf0b4\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0ef\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf0ef\uf0fe\n\uf0ef\uf0fd\n\uf0fc\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf03d\uf063 Eq. 2\nWe have shown elsewhere that around half of the ash content present in SRF of this\nplant is dissolving during the selective dissolution (Velis, 2009), making necessary to account\nfor this for an unbiased determination of the biogenic content. This dissolved ash may\noriginate from any of the inert, biogenic and non-biogenic parts of the sample, not enabling a\nstraightforward correction. The formula proposed by CEN, attempts to overcome these\ncomplexities, resulting in removing all the ash content present as part of biogenic materials\nfrom the \u2018pure biomass.\u2019 Hence, the CEN termed pure biomass on a dry basis is effectively\nbiomass without any of its ash. Thus, it constitutes an underestimation of the biogenic\ncontent on a dry mass basis.\nOn one hand, expressing the biogenic content on a dry mass basis without any ash\ncontent (\u03c7B,pure,d) can be potentially useful, if the energy content present in a biogenic material\nis to be computed in a dry-ash-free basis because the ash portion of \u03c7B is not combustible.\nSimilarly, some of the ash content present in materials generally considered as biogenic may\nbe of inert origin: characteristic case is chalk used as the filler material in paper-making\n(which completely dissolved during the selective dissolution procedure) (Cuperus and van\nDijk, 2002). On the other hand, it may well constitute a natural part of a biogenic material\nand where suitable it has to be reported as such. The practical limitations of the selective\ndissolution computation are not able to justify its reporting only in pure form and solutions\nhave to be investigated\n11\nHere, a comparison between the selective dissolution and the manual sorting methods are\nmade for the uncorrected for ash content values (\u03c7B,with ash,d), as explained below. Despite\nthat, pure biomass (\u03c7B,pure,d) results as measured with the proposed CEN formula are also\nreported to enable future comparisons of our data with those from other researchers.\nWhen reporting on a dry mass basis alone, it is suitable to report a mass percent\nvalue, uncorrected for ash, on dry basis: \u03c7B,with ash,d (w\/wd). Note that the Eq. 1 for the\ndetermination of biogenic content by the manual sorting method returns the uncorrected for\nash biomass (\u03c7B,ash-free,d) rather than the pure biomass (\u03c7B,pure,d). Because the ash content of\neach category sorted using the manual sorting method is unknown and not determined (this\nwould involve substantive and prolonged additional effort, and destruction of the samples\nneeded for the SDM), the DD CEN\/TS 15442:2006 suggests a correction termed \u2018sorting\nprecision\u2019. We instead introduce the term \u2018\u03c7B,with ash,d by SDM\u2019 which allows direct\ncomparison with the uncorrected for \u2018sorting precision\u2019 \u03c7B MSM data.\nThe \u03c7B,with ash,d by SDM can be either an underestimation or overestimation of the\nactual biogenic content percentage in a sample, depending on the relative ratios of the ash in\nboth the initial sample and the dried residues. Note that both dissolved and undissolved ash\nfractions (i.e., of biogenic, or non-biogenic, or inert sources) cancel in the \u03c7B,d formula,\nlimiting any bias introduced. The Eq. 3 corrects for the mass fraction of the discarded, non-\nshreddable components:\nsamplefulld\nfractiondreassembled\nsampletestd\nresiduedsampletestd\ndwithashB m\nm\nm\nmm\n,\n,\n,\n,,\n,, \uf0b4\uf0ef\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf0ef\uf0fe\n\uf0ef\uf0fd\n\uf0fc\uf02d\n\uf03d\uf063 Eq. 3\n2.6 Statistical analysis\nData were analysed using Statistica v8.0\u00a9 (StatSoft, 2008). Being bulk characteristics\nand reasonably homogeneous within each sample, moisture, ash and \u03c7B were assumed to\nfollow a normal distribution for each sample. For selective dissolution data, the uncertainty\n12\nis expressed as a combined extended uncertainty (Uc) for each data point (Ellison et al.,\n2000), using a coverage factor of 1.96. Despite the limited degrees of freedom available, this\ncoverage factor is thought as conservative enough to provide 95% confidence intervals\naround the mean values. Uncertainty from the duplicate determinations of moisture and ash\ncontent and the triplicate experimental \u03c7B values for initial sample mass and dry residue was\npropagated into the Uc.\nTo assess the correlation between the MSM and SDM estimates of the uncorrected for\nash biogenic content (\u03c7B,with ash,d), a geometric mean regression (GMR) was selected,\nreflecting the fact that both variables have random measurement errors (Leng et al., 2007).\nStandard errors for the GMR parameters were approximated using standard errors of the least\nsquare linear regression parameters (Sokal and Rolf, 1995), and tested using the t-statistic at\n95% confidence. Ideally, a correlation of the two methods would involve at least triplicate\nresults for both, with measurements being performed on exactly the same number of samples.\nDue to practical limitations, sorting was performed once for each sample. Obtained values\nshould be accepted as such, although no replicates are available to spot spurious errors or\nquantify the MSM repeatability. Furthermore, sorting needs to be performed on large\nsamples (300-15,000 g), while dissolution is carried out on aliquots from the GAS (5 g).\nExtrapolating the value of the biogenic content (\u03c7B,ash-free,d) of the fines from the\nadditional increment (INCad \u03c7B_fines) back to the samples on which the correlation is\nestimated upon (INC1 and INC2 samples), as done in the G1 and G2 methodological\nversions, assumes limited between-increment variation. Although the bias introduced by this\nis not quantifiable, we speculate the INCad \u03c7B_fines values could be closer to the true INC1 and\n2 values, than the fixed value of 50% w\/wd. When we perform the comparison of the SDM\n\u03c7B,ash-free,d with the MSM \u03c7B,ash-free,d and use the INCad \u03c7B_fines values as part of the MSM\ndetermination (cases G1 and G2 above), we equalise the influence of the fines category;\n13\nhence any difference should be allocated to the grouping of the rest of the materials into\ncategories. This is valid to the extent to which an approximation of the INC1 and 2 \u03c7B_fines by\nthe INCad \u03c7B_fines is accurate.\nTwo contributions to the random variation can be identified here: sub-sampling\nbetween MSM and SDM samples, which affects representativeness of SDM test-samples; and\npicking of three test-samples from the small, though slightly heterogeneous GAS, which\naffects the measured SDM repeatability by introducing between-replicate differences. To\nkeep these random sources of variability as low as possible, precautions were taken: (i) sub-\nsampling followed the theory of sampling (see Section 2.2 on manual sorting) to ensure the\nGAS is representative of the initially sorted sample; and (ii) the GAS, where comprising two\ndiscrete sub-fractions which could be described as a fluffy, cotton-like material and a\ngranular, heavy material, was manually homogenised before picking the three aliquots for the\nSDM. A nested experiment for the analysis of the components of variability (data not shown\nhere) of the SDM showed that the entire sub-sampling procedure introduced only very small\nvariability.\n3 Results and discussion\nResults are presented and discussed in three parts. Firstly, the results of the three manual\nsorting method variations are presented, along with certain intermediate results necessary,\nsuch as those for the biogenic content of the fines <10 mm. Then, the results of the selective\ndissolution method are discussed. Finally, the correlation between these datasets is covered.\n3.1 Manual sorting method\nHigher values for the biogenic content of the fines <10 mm part of a sample (\u03c7B_fines,d)\nmight have been anticipated than for the entire sample. Indirect verification comes from the\n\u03c7B_fines,d values in Table 4 and the \u03c7B,pure,d in Fig. 3 (discussed in detail in Section 3.2). Whilst\n14\na direct comparison between them is not feasible because of the different reporting base, it is\nnoted that for all process streams with a significant proportion of fines category (i.e.,\nexcluding SP1, 16), the \u03c7B_fines,d values are considerably higher than the biogenic content of\nthe overall sample, despite that the former (\u03c7B_fines,d) is \u2018with ash\u2019 and the latter \u2018pure\u2019\n(\u03c7B,pure,d).\n<Insert Table 4. Biogenic content of fines>\n<Insert Fig. 3. Selective dissolution experimental results (value \u00b1 Uc (= 1.96* SE))>\nThe manual sorting method data obtained through the 3 different methodological\nvariations (G1,2,3) suggest that categorisation and use of deemed vs. measured values for the\nbiogenic content of the fines (\u03c7B_fines) has a noticeable impact on estimating the biogenic\ncontent of the entire sample (\u03c7B), though not consistently across all the sampled process\nstreams (SPs) (Fig. 4). One might expect that detailed categorisation using 24 categories\n(G1) would give the most accurate results, whilst the grouped categorisation (G3) with fixed\n\u03c7B_fines would infer the most bias. Because all these methods constitute empirical\napproximations, this cannot be directly tested and verified. However, this assertion is\nindirectly supported by the results of the correlation study (Section 3.3).\n<insert Fig. 4. Effect of categorisation on estimations of biogenic content using the MSM>\nRe-grouping categories as in the 14 CEN ones (G2 and G3), results in a similar or higher\n\u03c7B than that estimated from the analysis of 24 categories (G1), for most of the process\nstreams, except for SRF-type ones (Fig. 4). This reflects the between-process stream\nvariability. Using a fixed value for \u03c7B_fines, as in G3, influences \u03c7B by virtue of (i) the fines\n15\nmass proportion in a process stream, which is considerable (namely >20% w\/war and >40%\nw\/war for 61% and 36% respectively of the studied population); and (ii) the difference\nbetween the proposed by QVOVADIS deemed value of 50% w\/wd and the true value of\n\u03c7B_fines. The determination of the biogenic content of the fines <10 mm component category\nof samples (\u03c7B_fines) by the selective dissolution method shows highly variable values (Table\n4). This justifies use of SDM to estimate it at each SP, especially for this study. This\nbetween-process stream variability can be partly accounted for by the progressive separation\nof increasingly homogeneous fractions within the MBT plant, achieved by concentrating\ndifferent types of materials. However, a high variability is also evident for the \u03c7B_fines of the\nprocess streams with composition similar to SRF (SP13): SP 10, 11, 12.\nFurthermore, a high variability can be anticipated for the composition of the fines of\nSRF, produced from different source materials (such as residual MSW input to MBT plants)\nand through varying processing concepts to differentiated end-use specifications.\nAdditionally, the weight fraction of the fines would be significant for most commercially\nspecified types of SRF having undergone size reduction at <30-40 mm (Velis et al., in press):\na typical mass fraction of fines in the SRF can be 40% w\/war (Velis, 2009). These results\nimply that deeming of the biogenic content of the SRF fines might lead to considerable bias.\nAs a result, investigating whether the determination of \u03c7B_fines,d by the selective dissolution\nmethod can prove useful in enhancing the determination of the \u03c7B,d by the MSM, is fully\njustified.\nGenerally, the G1 and G2 waste component grouping versions, not using a fixed value\nfor the \u03c7B_fines, are in better agreement compared to the agreement of each of G1 and G2 with\nthe G3. This suggests that the impact of deeming or not the \u03c7B_fines is higher than the impact\nof collapsing the 24 categories into the 14 suggested by CEN. For MBT process streams very\nclose in composition to the SRF (SP11, 12), the use of a fixed \u03c7B_fines = 50% w\/wd results in an\n16\nunderestimation of the biogenic content in all 4 cases examined, compared with the values\nmeasured by the selective dissolution method (ca 70% w\/wd, Table 4). However, this cannot\nbe generalised to every SRF production line.\nThe most heterogeneous MBT stream amongst those sampled and those with the lowest\npercentage of fines are SP1, 8 and 16; their low homogeneity is mainly due to their large\nparticle size and low gravimetric recovery. Here, the high between-increment variability\nindicates that any benefits from the extra effort to perform a more detailed sorting (G1) or to\nidentify the \u03c7B_fines separately by the selective dissolution method (G1 or G2) may not be\njustified unless an SRF production line is sufficiently stable in time.\nFor the cases where additional resources can be justified, an improved classification is\nproposed (Table 5), retaining those categories required to optimise sorting consistency,\naccuracy and repeatability. Here: (i) composites, fines < 10 mm and fluff are generic\nheterogeneous categories, in which material composition, \u03c7B and proportion of fines <10 mm\nmay vary according to the SRF production input and flowsheet; (ii) their \u03c7B value could be\nestimated using the selective dissolution method (e.g., on triplicates), where effort is justified\nor suitably deemed per SRF case (clear guidance and rules should apply); (iii) fragments of\nshoes and sanitary products (nappies) are difficult to indentify in finely shredded SRF: hence,\nthey would be identified possibly as composites; (iv) batteries typically do not reach the SRF\nstream, hence there is no need for them to appear in the standard classification; and (v) the\nhousehold hazardous waste category comprises almost 100% non-biogenic materials and can\nbe allocated to plastics or metals.\nSome categories have been merged without influencing the results of the method,\nbecause they are attributed the same coefficient (e.g., wood and biological waste). If the\nmethod is applied to process streams other than SRF (especially input to the processing\n17\nsection and large rejects), the soft plastic category should be separated and its \u03c7B recalculated,\nbecause of the potential for substantial food contamination. However, it is expected that\nthese simplifications would only slightly reduce the sorting time, because fragment\nrecognition takes more time than sorting into categories.\n<Insert Table 5. Proposed classification for standard optimisation>\n3.2 Selective dissolution method\nFig. 3 presents the (arithmetic) mean (n=3 for each sample) pure biogenic content values\n(\u03c7B,pure,d) determined by the SDM for various process streams (SPs) within the mechanical\nprocessing section of the MBT plant, for the first 2 increments (INC1,2). Notably these\nresults are not necessary for the evaluation of the correlation between the manual sorting\nmethod variations and the selective dissolution method but are presented here for the future\nbenefit of researchers who will produce results in full agreement with the DD CEN\/TS\n15442:2006.\nThese results are consistent with those anticipated for the plant flowsheet configuration\nresulting in an enrichment of the biogenic content of the SRF in comparison to the biodried\ninput (SP1). However, this is by-and-large due to the removal of the mineralised waste\ncomponents (\u2018inert\u2019 fraction) the- relevant issues are detailed elsewhere (Velis, 2009).\nThe between-process stream-variability is high, reflecting the differences in the\ncomposition at each process stream which can be visualised in the texture of the final general\nanalysis samples, and the aspect of filtrates and residues. The within-process stream and\nbetween-increment (INC1 and INC2) variability is considerable, but lower than the between-\nprocess stream. The combined extended uncertainty (Uc) for each data point varies between\n0.02% w\/wd and 1.6% w\/wd, with an average of 0.5% w\/wd.\n18\nRegarding the reputability of the selective dissolution method, the relative standard\ndeviation (RSD) varied between 0.1% and 2.4%, with a mean of 0.9%. Ninety-three percent\nof the samples studied show an RSD <1.5%, which is comparable to validated standard\nmethods. Empirical observations show that parameters influencing method repeatability are:\nreaction time; reaction intensity, resulting in the degree of foaming which may lead to\nundigested sample depositions on the walls of the flasks; stability of drying; the ashing\nconditions (in all cases full ashing was evident), and the consistency of test-sample picking,\nespecially for heterogeneous GAS, such as the partly fluffy \u2013 partly granular ones.\nBecause the method is destructive, measurements cannot be repeated on the same test-\nsamples, and therefore the within-final general analysis sample variability, caused by sample\nheterogeneity, cannot be unravelled from analytical variability. For SRF samples, the\ncombined extended uncertainty (Uc) varied from 0.36% w\/wd to 0.89% w\/wd while standard\ndeviation on triplicates varied from 0.06% w\/wd to 0.79% w\/wd. The method appears to have a\nremarkably good repeatability when used for SRF, confirming the QUOVADIS findings\n(standard deviation of triplicates around 1.2% w\/wd) (QUOVADIS, 2007).\n3.3 Correlation between the MSM and the SDM\nCorrelations are calculated for the biogenic content, on a dry mass basis and uncorrected\nfor ash content, between each of the three sets of manual sorting methodological variations\n(\u03c7B, with ash,d MSM results, by G1,2,3) and the single set of data obtained from the selective\ndissolution method (\u03c7B, with ash,d SMS results) (Table 6, Fig. 5).\n<Insert Table 6. Geometric mean regressions parameter>\n<Insert Fig. 5. MSM and SDM correlations>\nCorrelations are commonly used for method validation, using a reference method, or\nreference samples. Currently, no reference method exists for SRF biogenic content. 14C\n19\nmethod can potentially measure more accurately the biogenic content, but it is not yet fully\nmature despite significant research (European Committee for Standardisation, 2007; Fellner\nand Rechberger, 2009; Staber et al., 2008). Here, the empirical surrogate of selective\ndissolution method is used to estimate the MSM precision because it is recognised by the DD\nCEN\/TS 15442:2006 (European Committee for Standardisation, 2006a) as the \u201cmain [\u2026]\nmethod\u201d (European Committee for Standardisation, 2006a). In this study, manual sorting\nmethod results are assessed for their similarity with selective dissolution method results. But\nno statement can be made regarding accuracy, as the true value of the measured biogenic\ncontent is unknown for all samples, especially in the absence of readily available and matrix-\nmatched certified reference materials.\nbSDMdwithashBMSMdwithashB \uf02b\uf0b4\uf03d ,,,,,, a \uf063\uf063 Eq. 4\nEq. 4 provides the model fitted using geometric mean regression. For all regressions,\na \u2260 1 and b \u2260 0 (at level of significance \u03b1 = 0.05). Our data show that the variations of the\nmanual sorting method and the selective dissolution method provide statistically significantly\ndifferent results (Table 6). However, depending on accuracy required for practical\napplications, they can be regarded as providing similar results, for a range of biogenic content\nvalues (\u03c7B,with ash,d). Based on detailed sorting (G1) regression model, the relative difference\nbetween MSM and SDM results is <5% for \u03c7B,with ash,d ranging from 21% w\/wd to 72% w\/wd.\nConsidering the 95% confidence intervals, the regression parameters are not considerably\ndifferent from one another for the three models based upon for the 3 manual storing method\nvariations (G1,2,3) (Table 6).\nResults from the two manual sorting approaches using variable \u03c7B_fines as estimated by\nthe selective dissolution method (G1, 2) are closer to the ones of exclusively selective\ndissolution method. No practical difference can be established between the detailed (G1) and\ngrouped (G2) approaches. Both are high quality regressions, experimental values being\n20\ntightly distributed around the linear models (coefficient of determination: r\u00b2>0.96, small\nconfidence intervals for both a and b).\nAlthough no statistical difference can be asserted on the 95% confidence basis,\napplying a fixed, deemed value to the biogenic content of fines (\u03c7B_fines) reduces the quality of\nthe regression (r\u00b2(G3)< r2 (G1\/2)) and increases the gap between the regression and the ideal\nequation \u03c7B,with ash,d,MSM = \u03c7B,with ash,d,SDM (a = 1, b = 0). This means the improved method\nsuggested in this study (based on G1 manual sorting methodological variation) provides\nresults marginally closer to those of the selective dissolution method than those achieved by\nthe manual sorting method as defined by the DD CEN\/TS 15442:2006 (European Committee\nfor Standardisation, 2006a) and incorporating the QUOVADIS suggestions (G3 case).\nNo particular trend was found showing a link between sample composition, texture\nand aspect, and relative results of the two methods. Hence, it seems feasible to use suitable\nmanual sorting data to estimate biogenic content on a dry mass basis uncorrected for ash\ncontent for a sample, for a wide range of MBT-related material flows. However, if only the\nSRF and similar types of samples were considered (generally \u03c7B,d,SDM between 50-70% w\/wd),\nthe correlation between the methods would not have been as evident, as it can be inferred\nfrom visual inspection of Fig. 5. Hence, further investigation is necessary to establish that the\nmanual sorting method can sufficiently differentiate and accurately match the biogenic\ncontent of SRF-like materials (i.e., in the range of 50-70% w\/wd).\nThe manual sorting method variations show a tendency to return lower results than the\nselective dissolution method for SRF-types of samples (Fig. 5). This is different to both the\nQUOVADIS conclusions (QUOVADIS, 2007), but all studies were limited in their number\nof samples and classification categories. It is not fully clear how the QUOVADIS and the\nGerman inter-laboratory studies have compared the two methods, especially regarding the\nreporting basis of the results. In addition, this discrepancy may be indicative of, and\n21\nattributed to, the variability in sorting practices: whilst sorting for biogenic content\ndetermination is relatively straightforward (albeit lengthy), there is always the possibility for\ndifferentiated interpretations and applications by research groups and individual sorters.\n4 Conclusions and recommendations\n(1) The manual sorting method is long and tedious, while the selective dissolution\nmethod necessitates laboratory staff and equipment. In practice, the method\nselection should be based on the objective of the measurement and how often it\nneeds to be carried out.\n(2) Further research is necessary to enable the measurement of the biogenic content of\nwaste-derived product such as SRF, accurately accounting for the part of its ash\nthat is genuinely of biogenic origin, overcoming the limitations of the \u2018pure\u2019\nbiomass or \u2018uncorrected for ash content\u2019 methodological approaches.\n(3) The manual sorting method, as defined by the draft standard amended by the\nQUOVADIS suggestions, introduces uncertainty due to the grouping of some\nheterogeneous categories and the use of a fixed deemed coefficient for the\nbiogenic content of the fines <10 mm (\u03c7B_fines: 50% w\/wd), despite their\nunpredictable content. An optimised categorisation has been proposed here,\nkeeping the number of categories as low as possible and strategically chosen to\nallow an attribution of biogenic content coefficients as subtly and precisely as\npossible. This is expected to slightly reduce sorting time and necessary skills,\nwhile enhancing result quality and accuracy.\n(4) The estimation of the biomass content of the fines <10 mm fraction by the\nselective dissolution method for use within the computations of the manual sorting\nmethod can further improve the ability of the method to simulate of the biogenic\n22\ncontent (on a dry mass basis uncorrected for ash) as measured by the selective\ndissolution method DM; the necessary additional effort and cost could be\npractically meaningful if the long-term variability of the examined material stream\nis low enough.\n(5) The SDM is considered as the most accurate method, repeatability and result\nuncertainty seem satisfactory especially for SRF. This high repeatability can be\npartly assigned to a careful implementation of the standard, by mitigating potential\nsources of variability as far as practicable, especially regarding sample\npreparation. No conclusion could be drawn regarding methods accuracy; results\nfrom round-robin tests carried on certified reference SRF available both as large\nfragments and final general analysis samples can assist to appraise repeatability,\nreproducibility and accuracy of both methods. Despite the inherent\nmethodological difficulties and a series on inevitable assumption and\napproximations, the selective dissolution method and manual sorting method\ncorrelate remarkably well (0.89<r\u00b2<0.96) for the range of materials studied, but\nprovide statistically different results for biogenic content, on a dry mass basis,\nuncorrected for ash (\u03c7B,with ash,d) (at the level of significance \u03b1 = 0.05). However,\nfor SRF-type of samples a correlation able to sufficiently differentiate within the\nencountered range of values is not implied, suggesting that closer examination for\nSRF-only materials is necessary.\n(6) The manual sorting method returns lower results than the selective dissolution\nmethod for SRF-types of samples, which contradicts previous evidence and seeks\nfurther investigation. Although intended for use on SRF, the two methods seem to\nperform adequately for very different waste streams. It would be of interest for\nMBT process monitoring purpose to include in the standard a section covering the\n23\napplication of the methods to various MBT streams, including practical\nadjustments and expected accuracy. This result also enables to estimate the\nbiogenic content of the SRF and rest outputs, from the plant processing input,\nassuming a known composition of section input and sufficient knowledge of\nrelevant transfer coefficients for processing of waste components.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was funded by Grantscape and a consortium of third parties under the Landfill\nTax Credit Scheme (Project 158\/169).
