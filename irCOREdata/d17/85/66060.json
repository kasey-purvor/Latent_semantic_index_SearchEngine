Ice sheet disintegration, sea level rise,\nand other long-term detrimental effects have driven research\ninto finding alternative energy sources.1 A promising route to\nproducing clean and renewable energy is through the use of\nsolar cells, which harvest power directly from sunlight. In\nparticular, plastic solar cells open up the possibility of fabri-\ncating inexpensive large-area devices at relatively low\ntemperatures.2 Furthermore, plastic devices can be mechani-\ncally flexible, processed into complex shapes, and colored\ndepending upon their chemical structure, leading the way to\nnew and more interesting photovoltaic applications.2 Com-\nputational studies can offer materials scientists a unique in-\nsight into the mechanics of these polymer solar cells and, in\nparticular, the role polymer blend morphologies play in de-\nvice performance. We show how computer simulations can\nbe used to not only predict polymer morphologies, but how\nthe output from our morphological studies can be used as the\ninput to a computer model of photovoltaic behavior. There-\nfore, we can correlate polymer structure and photovoltaic\nproperties, showing how choices made regarding the poly-\nmeric constituents and processing conditions can ultimately\naffect the solar cell performance.\nTypically, an organic solar cell consists of two distinct\nmaterials sandwiched in between two electrodes of differing\nwork functions \u0001resulting in an internal electric field\u0002. One\nmaterial is hole transporting while the other is electron trans-\nporting \u0001often referred to as donor and acceptor materials\u0002.\nEither material is capable of absorbing a photon, resulting in\nthe formation of an electron-hole pair, the electron and hole\nbeing bound to each other by their electrostatic attraction\n\u0001see Fig. 1\u0002. This bound pair constitutes an \u201cexciton\u201d and can\nbe thought of as a mobile excited state.3 Excitons are\nstrongly bound in organic materials but may dissociate at the\ninterface between two materials with different electron af-\nfinities and ionization potentials.4 Once the charge carriers\nare dissociated at the donor-acceptor \u0001DA\u0002 interface the in-\nternal electric field sweeps electrons to the cathode and holes\nto the anode, thus allowing this current to be used in the\nexternal circuit.\nExciton dissociation depends critically on the DA inter-\nface; hence, the performance of organic solar cells is highly\nsensitive to the morphology. Excitons generally diffuse\n\u000310 nm prior to decay and must reach an interface within\nthis distance in order for dissociation to occur. Meanwhile,\nhigh absorption coefficients in organic materials lead to\n100 nm, or thicker, devices. It is this difference in length\nscales, and the need to ensure charge transport from the DA\ninterface to the electrodes, which results in devices which are\nvery sensitive to morphological effects.5\nThe simplest organic photovoltaic cell is the bilayer de-\nvice originally proposed by Tang.4 After exciton dissociation\nelectrons are found in the acceptor and holes in the donor,\nresulting in large asymmetric charge-carrier gradients at the\ninterface. This means that not only is current conveyed to the\ncircuit because of the internal electric field, but also because\nof a diffusion current.3,6 However, as only the excitons gen-\nerated within \u000310 nm of the DA interface have a chance to\ndissociate, most excitons decay prior to dissociation, wasting\nabsorbed solar energy.\nIn order to overcome this loss mechanism a morphology\nwhose domain size is comparable to the exciton diffusion\nlength is required. Bulk heterojunction devices, comprised of\nbicontinuous and interpenetrating networks of donor and ac-\n1\n2\n3\nFIG. 1. \u0001Color online\u0002 Illustration of \u00011\u0002 photon absorption, \u00012\u0002\nexciton dissociation, and \u00013\u0002 charge transport.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 74, 085207 \u00012006\u0002\n1098-0121\/2006\/74\u00018\u0002\/085207\u00015\u0002 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society085207-1\nceptor materials, satisfy this requirement.7\u20139 Blending the do-\nnor and acceptor polymers, such that no point is more than a\nfew nanometers from a DA interface, results in efficient\ncharge generation throughout the whole volume of the de-\nvice. However, this convoluted morphology possesses resis-\ntive bottlenecks and cul-de-sacs which prohibit free charges\nfrom reaching the electrodes.\nIn order to ensure efficient charge carrier transport an ide-\nalized morphology must be realized. Coakley et al.10,11 pro-\nduced an ideal device architecture for organic-inorganic solar\ncells. The morphology consisted of straight phases aligned\nperpendicular to the substrate, but with only the appropriate\nphase being connected to the electrodes. Not only are exci-\ntons generated close to a DA interface, but there are also\nuninterrupted pathways to the electrodes. The phases are\nconnected exclusively to the appropriate electrodes to ensure\nthat only electrons diffuse in the desired direction to the\nelectron-withdrawing electrode and, likewise, only holes dif-\nfuse to the hole-withdrawing electrode. Therefore, the charge\ncarriers drift towards their respective electrodes due to the\nbuilt-in electric field and also diffuse towards the electrodes\nbased entirely on the internal morphology of the device.\nCoakley et al.10,11 produced devices that were 3 times more\nefficient than equivalent planar devices.\nRecently, there has been a flurry of interest in semicon-\nducting diblock copolymers.12\u201314 The intrinsic length scale of\nphase separation in diblock copolymers makes them ideal\nconstituents for organic solar cells. Furthermore, the mor-\nphology of diblock copolymer systems can be manipulated.\nFor example, surface-induced ordering of diblock copoly-\nmers can lead to domains oriented either parallel or perpen-\ndicular to the surface.15 Diblock copolymer domains can also\nbe aligned through the application of an electric field.16 What\nwe propose here is a method of controlling the phase sepa-\nration dynamics of diblock copolymers in order to produce\nideal morphologies for photovoltaic applications.\nIn order to predict the morphologies in these systems we\nemploy the Flory-Huggins Cahn-Hilliard model, where the\nfree energy is of the form\nF =\u0004 1N \u0005\u0001\u0001r\u0002ln \u0001\u0001r\u0002 + \u00061 \u2212 \u0001\u0001r\u0002\u0007ln\u00061 \u2212 \u0001\u0001r\u0002\u0007\b\n+ \u0002\u0001\u0001r\u0002\u00061 \u2212 \u0001\u0001r\u0002\u0007 +\nb2\t\u0001\u0001\u0001r\u0002\t2\n36\u0001\u0001r\u0002\u00061 \u2212 \u0001\u0001r\u0002\u0007\ndr\n+\n\u0003\n2 \u0004 \u0004 G\u0001r, r\u00b4\u0002\u0006\u0001\u0001r\u0002 \u2212 \u0001\u00af \u0007\u0006\u0001\u0001r\u00b4\u0002 \u2212 \u0001\u00af \u0007drdr\u0001\n+\u0004 \u2212 \u0004\u0001\u0001\u0002\tE\t28\u0005 dr +\u0004 \u0004 12V exp\u0001\u2212 \tr \u2212 s\t\/r0\u0002\n\u0006\u0006\u0001\u0001r\u0002 \u2212 \u0001S\u00072drds , \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u0001\u0001r\u0002 is the local concentration of donor polymers.

F\u0001a\u0002 represents this\ndistribution function, and Nf is a normalization factor.\nR\u0001x\u0002=x \/\u000bx represents exciton decay, where \u000bx is the average\nlifetime of an exciton.

A fraction \u0001commonly taken as\n1\n4 \u0002 recom-\nbine to form excitons.

They assumed that\nthe hopping rate between two sites differing in energy by \rE\nis proportional to exp\u0006\u2212\u0001\rE+Ep\u00022 \/4kTEp\u0007, where Ep is the\npolaron binding energy. For metal-semiconductor interfaces\nwe adopt the boundary conditions of Scott and Malliaras.26\nThe precise form of the current in these Schottky barriers can\nbe found in Barker et al.6 The Scharfetter-Gummel method27\nis used to spatially discretize the above equations, which are\nsolved semi-implicitly using the finite-difference method.22\nIn this manner, the physics of organic solar cells can be\ncaptured.\nIt is worth noting that while commercially available drift-\ndiffusion models can simulate inorganic devices they do not\ncurrently account for the generation, diffusion, or dissocia-\ntion of excitons in organic devices. Previous studies that\nhave computationally investigated organic solar cells have\neither neglected excitons altogether3 \u0001assuming that electrons\nand holes are simply \u201cgenerated\u201d at the interface\u0002 or been\nlimited to bilayer devices.6 Here, we simulate the diffusion\nof electrons, holes, and excitons throughout the system\nwhich enables us to simulate the effects of complex internal\nmorphologies.\nContour plots of exciton density are shown in Figs. 3\u0001a\u0002\nand 3\u0001b\u0002, corresponding to the disordered and ideal mor-\nphologies. In both systems the morphology is clearly evident\nas exciton dissociation occurs almost exclusively at the DA\ninterface. Excitons are diffusing to the DA interface where\nthey are most likely to dissociate. The electron and hole con-\ncentrations are also depicted in Figs. 3\u0001c\u0002\u20133\u0001f\u0002. The internal\nelectric field is such that it sweeps electrons to the cathode\n\u0001y=0\u0002 and holes to the anode \u0001y=100\u0002. However, in the con-\nvoluted disordered system the electrons and holes are prohib-\nited from reaching the electrodes by the presence of \u201cdead\nends\u201d in the morphology. In other words, the charge carriers\ntravel down cul-de-sacs only to find themselves surrounded\nby the DA interface. This results in large charge-carrier con-\ncentrations at dead ends, such that the diffusion process away\nfrom a dead end opposes the drift process due to the internal\nelectric field. However, in the ideal morphology it can be\nseen that the charge carriers have a direct pathway from the\nDA interface to the correct electrodes. Therefore, not only\nare excitons efficiently dissociated, but the charge carriers\nare easily swept to the electrodes by the internal electric\nfield.\nThe effects of this on the I-V curves can be seen in Fig. 4\nwhich depicts the response of systems with bilayer, bulk het-\nerojunction, and ideal morphologies. The planar device has\nlittle short-circuit current \u0001Isc\u0002, due to fewer charge carriers\nbeing present. However, the open-circuit voltage \u0001Voc\u0002 is\nlarge as a consequence of the large diffusion currents in these\nsystems.3,6 The bulk heterojunction has a Voc due entirely to\nthe difference in work function between the two electrode\nmetals \u0001\u00030.5 V\u0002. This is because in this symmetric system\nthere is no net diffusion process. Isc is greater in the bulk\nheterojunction than in the planar device as the larger interfa-\ncial area results in a greater charge carrier generation. This is\nalso the case for the ideal morphology, except now the\ncharge carriers can drift to the correct electrodes unimpeded\nand, hence, the Isc is much greater in these systems. The\nplanar device has a power conversion efficiency of \u00030.7%\nwhich is reasonable for such systems.4 The bulk heterojunc-\ntion systems, for the parameters considered here, actually\nperform slightly worse than the planar device and possess\nefficiencies of \u00030.6%. However, the devices with an ideal\nmorphology have a much higher efficiency of \u00032.2%: 3\ntimes greater than the planar device. This highlights the role\nof morphology in these systems and emphasizes the superi-\nority of the ideal morphology over both the planar and dis-\nordered bulk heterojunction morphologies.\nTo summarize, we have simulated the photovoltaic\nmechanism in organic solar cells and elucidated exciton\nFIG. 4. Current-voltage \u0001I-V\u0002 curves for systems with planar\n\u0001\u0001\u0002, disordered bulk heterojunction \u0001\u2022\u0002, and ideal \u0001\u0002\u0002 morpholo-\ngies. Isc is defined as the current when V=0 and, similarly, Voc is\ndefined as the applied voltage when I=0. The power conversion\nefficiency is given by the maximum value of I-V divided by the\ntotal solar irradiance.\nGAVIN A.

Furthermore, we have investigated\nthe effects of complex diblock copolymer morphologies on\ndevice performance and, in particular, tailored these mor-\nphologies to meet photovoltaic needs. We have shown how\nsurface-induced ordering and electric-field-induced align-\nment can be combined to create ideal morphologies for pho-\ntovoltaic applications.\n1 J. Hansen, L. Nazarenko, R.
