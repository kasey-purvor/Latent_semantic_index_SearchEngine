But every fourth \nwell is polluted with arsenic, with the result that millions of people are exposed to a \nsevere environmental hazard.  We explore this crisis from the viewpoint of legal \ngeographies.  The case of Sutradhar v NERC is taken as an exemplar of a debate about \n\u2018proximity\u2019 between scientific consultants and aid donors on the one hand, and their \nclients in poor countries on the other.  In short, the article is about the desirability of \nbringing responsibility into line with supposed generosity. \n \n \nkey words  environmental health, arsenic poisoning, water, Bangladesh, legal \ngeography, proximity, toxic torts  \n 2\nToxic torts:  arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh and the legal geographies of \nresponsibility \n \nIntroduction  \nIn 2002, the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights \nrecognized access to water as an independent human right: \u2018the right to water clearly falls \nwithin the category of guarantees essential for securing an adequate standard of living, \nparticularly since it is one of the most fundamental conditions for survival\u2019 (WHO 2003).  \nAmong the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Bangladesh has taken this right most \nseriously.  Approximately 97 per cent of its rural people now have access to \nbacteriologically clean water (MLG 2003), as a result of the installation of about 12 \nmillion tubewells.1  These supply about 80 per cent of national drinking water demand \n(Ahmed 2002).2  We can attribute at least part of the significant drop in infant mortality, \nfrom 151 to 83 per thousand 1960-96, and in under-five mortality from 247 to 112 per \nthousand, to this ready availability of clean water (WHO 2000).3  Until the middle of the \n1990s this was the only element of national water policy that had widespread support and \nthat did not present major technical difficulties (Black 1990).  The other strands, \nincluding the Flood Action Plan, sanitation, water pollution, irrigation, drainage, cyclone \nshelters, and fisheries, were all more or less problematic and their policies widely \ncriticized (Wood 1999).4  \n \nThe expansion of tubewells came with the financial help of UNICEF after the \nindependence of Bangladesh in 1971.  At first sight, they seem to be the perfect \ndevelopment tool \u2013 a cheap and effective technology that has been received \nenthusiastically by the users.  Having a tubewell was a matter of convenience but also a \nstatus symbol and, as a result, people have been willing to invest their own money in \nprivate installations (Black 1990).  There are limitless supplies of the raw material \nunderground, a Promethean bounty waiting to be released.  However, the result of this \nreliance upon tubewells \u2013 a cruel irony this \u2013 has been an environmental health disaster \nof unprecedented proportions, many times worse than Chernobyl and Bhopal combined \n(Smith et al. 2000).  About a third of tubewells produce seriously contaminated water, \nwith a broad swathe across the centre and south of the country being particularly at risk \n(Atkins et al. 2006a).5 One estimate is that millions of people will die or suffer from the \nvery serious consequences of consuming the arsenic that occurs naturally in aquifers in \n 3\nthe Holocene sediments of the Bengal delta (Yu et al. 2003).6 Arsenic is a colourless, \nodourless and tasteless poison and, to give an idea of its miniscule presence, it occurs at \nthe equivalent of about one-third of a teaspoon-full dissolved in the water of an \nOlympic-sized swimming pool (Meharg 2004).   \n \nOne exemplary case of is that of Binod Sutradhar, a carpenter from Ramrail in \nBrahmanbaria district.  He suffers from painful keratoses, hard lumps or papules, on his \nhands and feet, which he claims are the result of consuming water contaminated with \nminute traces of arsenic.7  In 2001, along with a large group of his fellow sufferers, he \ndecided to take on the might of the western science-based aid complex, in the surrogate \nform of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).  They are the parent body \nof the British Geological Survey (BGS), who in the early 1990s undertook a survey of \ngroundwater quality in his region (Davies and Exley 1992), on behalf of the Overseas \nDevelopment Administration (ODA).  This failed to check for arsenic and, because of \nthis oversight, Mr Sutradhar accuses the NERC of negligence. Other possible defendants \nmight have been the Government of Bangladesh (GoB), or the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), both of which have encouraged the sinking of tubewells, \nbut the NERC was chosen instead in the ironic context of postcolonial environmental \njustice, with the litigation taking place under the jurisdiction of the courts of the former \nimperial power. The case has so far progressed from a hearing in the High Court in \nLondon to the Court of Appeal and in 2006 it will go to the House of Lords.8  The legal \nargument to date has only been about whether a trial should take place and no detailed \nevidence has yet been heard. \n \nMr Sutradhar is alleging a \u2018tort\u2019, legally defined as a damage caused by someone else\u2019s \naction or inaction. The point of law at stake is the controversial notion of \u2018proximity\u2019: the \nnature of the relationship between the plaintiff and defendant in terms of geography and \n\u2018duty of care\u2019.  The NERC\/BGS is alleged to be liable because of its responsibility, \nthrough its water monitoring activities, to the water consumers who would have \nbenefited from a fuller analysis of the samples they collected. This is a developing area of \nenvironmental law that has major implications for scientific consultancy and the \napplication of expert knowledge in the aid industry, and it raises the issue of whether \nwestern academics and researchers have a legal responsibility to their clients in the LDCs.  \nIf we were writing lurid tabloid headlines, we might call it the \u2018Revenge of the Third \n 4\nWorld\u2019: the frankly extraordinary prospect of ordinary people, who have suffered the \nnegative environmental consequences of failed development projects, claiming damages \nin courts around the world.  \n \nA more measured legal appraisal is that proximity, in its present definition at least, will be \ndifficult to prove in the case of the mass arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh and that the \nNERC is very unlikely to be found liable for any failure in their duty of care (Pugh and \nCriddle 2004).  But the importance of Sutradhar v NERC may be more symbolic than \nhaving a specific outcome for the Bangladeshi litigants.  If the case ever comes to trial it \ncould act as a trojan horse in terms of the legal arguments that may be used in future, \nstronger cases of negligence in environmental policy or practice.  The potential \nsignificance, in terms of the emergence of a new breed of transboundary environmental \nactions with a global face, has been revealed recently in the journal Nature, where it has \nbeen speculated by Allen and Lord (2004) that evidence linking global warming to the \nrelease of greenhouse gases is now so strong that at some point it may be possible to \nmount a legal argument apportioning blame for deleterious consequences.  The example \nthey give is the enhanced death rates in parts of western Europe due to increases in \ntemperatures of up to 10\u00b0 C higher than normal in the summer of 2003.   \n \nThe present paper addresses the principal irony that well-intentioned actions to provide \nsustainable solutions to environmental problems occasionally go wrong with disastrous \nconsequences.  In this case the actions were international, and Sutradhar v NERC seeks, \nin the globalized context of the aid industry, to bring responsibility in line with supposed \ngenerosity.9  We start with a consideration of the tortious spaces of the arsenic crisis in \nBangladesh.  This is followed by a consideration of fault and liability through a \ndiscussion of the case that has been brought in the British courts.  Finally, we conclude \nwith a discussion of the concept of proximity. \n \nWhat space for environmental justice? \nNick Blomley and David Delaney have pioneered legal geographies and enhanced our \nunderstanding of how courts construct and interpret place and space (Blomley 1994, \nDelaney et al. 2001).  But, as Delaney (2001, 487-88) remarks, nature and the \nenvironment have been \u2018virtually neglected\u2019 in this literature.  We foresee in the present \npaper the emergence of new legal geographies of socio-natures.  These are the means by \n 5\nwhich nature is penetrated and regulated through the structures of the law.  We reject, \nfor instance, dualisms of culture and nature and regard the generation of poisoned water \nfrom a latent source as neither a wholly technological, nor as a solely geological \nphenomenon.  It is a novel hazard that has few parallels.  No profit was involved and no \nmanufacture, and there was no accidental release of bye-products, so comparison with \nstandard chemical pollution incidents is fruitless.  The sole victims are humans, so there \ncan be no charge of ecocide.  The international dimension involves no dispute about \ncontested raw materials or waste products.  Rather, this is an environmental health crisis \nthat could be viewed as a tragic accident that was not foreseeable, or as an act of \nscientific incompetence and gross negligence that requires redress through the \nmechanisms of compensation and deterrence.   \n \nVarious lines of redress for damage are available in the international law protecting \npublic environmental health.  The first is application of the criminal law, where a state \nbody may prosecute polluters for infringements of official regulations (Koenig and \nRustad 2004).  This is most appropriate for companies producing hazardous waste and is \nnot relevant for our discussion.  Second, there is the arena of public international law, in \nwhich obligations are adduced for both state and non-state actors.  The International \nLaw Commission of the United Nations is seeking to clarify and codify these, for \ninstance with respect to transboundary environmental damage, and impacts upon the \nglobal commons.  Among geographers, Mason (1999, 2001, and 2005) has probably \ncontributed most in this area to understandings of the spatialities of transnational \nenvironmental harm.  He adopts a stance of critical pragmatism and shows how a \ncombination of treaty obligations, the \u2018soft law\u2019 of declarations and resolutions (Paradell-\nTrius 2000), and court rulings, has contributed to a redistribution of authority away from \nthe nation state.  International bodies, corporations, NGOs and other non-state actors \nare now increasingly empowered to make spaces of environmental justice.  Mason (2001) \ninterrogates Habermas\u2019s principle of communicative discourse and finds a non-territorial \nversion of democratic accountability.  This is underpinned in the literature of \nenvironmental pragmatism by parallel moral spaces of transnational obligation, although \nas yet the response of the international community has been slow, no doubt because \nproven and legally-enforceable obligations can be expensive. \n \n 6\nThird, private international environmental law is a field that has grown in parallel with \nthe global green agenda in the last twenty years, but cross-boundary toxic tort cases \nbetween private parties have so far had limited exposure.  The International Court of \nJustice has taken on environmental cases since 1993 but only at the state-to-state level \n(Alkoby, 2003; Fitzmaurice, 2004).  The potentially promising idea of an International \nEnvironmental Court for non-state disputes has not progressed beyond the stage of \nspeculation (Rest 1998), and the bilateral and multilateral agreements within which cross-\nboundary environmental torts can be litigated remain inadequate for private cases and \ninstitutionally thin (Rao 2004).10  Plaintiffs thus have to fall back on testing their \nentitlement to environmental justice by suing for compensation in their own courts \nunder domestic common law or in foreign jurisdictions, as with Sutradhar v NERC.   \n \nThe present paper investigates private tort litigation.11  In tort lawsuits, injured parties \nmay sue to recover their position before the tort, through various forms of corrective \njustice such as monetary compensation or remediation. In the United States, the father of \ntort theory in the late nineteenth was Oliver Wendell Holmes, and he distinguished three \ntypes of legal redress (Rosenberg 1995).  First was the application of the principle of \n\u2018strict liability\u2019, where the perpetrator of unintentional damage may be held to account, \nfor instance, for the use of an inherently dangerous or unpredictable technology, even \nwithout the need to prove fault.12  Second, negligence may be judged tortious, as may the \nthird, and obvious category, of intentional wrongs.  In Britain, the law of torts, a branch \nof the common law, has been gradually accumulating over the centuries, and it is still \u2018an \nobject in motion\u2019 (Xue 2003, 270), with scope for further development.  For instance, \nthere has been a rapid acceleration of compensation claims in recent years, following the \nexample of personal injury litigation in the U.S.A...  As the name suggests, a \u2018toxic tort\u2019 is \ncaused by a noxious substance that damages health (Pugh and Day 1995), a recent \nexample, for instance, being mesothelioma, which is caused by exposure to asbestos \n(White 2004).   \n \nAs yet, geographers have tended to approach torts from the points of view of \nenvironmental sustainability or the liability regimes of transnational corporations in \nglobal economic governance.  Mason (2001, 421) reminds us that corporate capitals are \nwell positioned in their operating strategies \u2018to displace liability claims on to less stringent \njudicial systems (notably in the global South) where the damage occurred\u2019 and away from \n 7\nthe courts in Europe and North America, where scrutiny is more rigorous.  The present \npaper addresses just such an attempt to shift the locus of liability via arguments about the \nrelationship between the parties in a court case; but the case is being heard in the British \ncourts and this is an important landmark in opening out the question of jurisdiction of \ntransboundary environmental issues.  Our emphasis upon civil liability highlights an \napproach that, according to Mason (2001, 422), is gradually \u2018accumulating legal authority\u2019. \n \nThe globalization of notions of justice is a relatively recent phenomenon.  Silbey (2001) \ncomments that televised images of the American legal process, usually criminal court \ncases, have helped to spread such ideas, in the sense that they are products \u2018sold\u2019 in a \npostmodern, postcolonial setting of entertainment in which the signs are consumed, \nsignifying hypothetical rights of redress.  But for her this does not indicate any immediate \nlikelihood of progress and in fact she suggests that currently the phrase \u2018global justice\u2019 is \nan oxymoron.  Although expectations have been created through the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights (1948), there are many countries where the practical socio-\nlegal empowerment of poor people for such basic needs as clean water remains distant.   \n \nThe social movement literature on LDCs indicates that, although civil society remains \nweak in many of these countries, there are increasing numbers of NGOs pursuing legal \nchannels for the resolution of environmental issues, thus producing democratic spaces \nthat in the global North would more often be associated with formal state institutions \n(Stiles 2002).  Morgan (2005), for instance, has found widespread evidence of social \nprotest on water issues.  In Bangladesh there is a rich variety of such movements with a \nlegal or environmental emphasis, and their reach is gradually taking on an international \ndimension through links with overseas partners.  In the present case study we will \nencounter Brotee, an indigenous NGO working on water since 1997, and the Bangladesh \nEnvironmental Lawyers Association (BELA).13  Both are active in a range of \nenvironmental issues and for the arsenic case they have been assisted by the London-\nbased Bangladesh International Action Network and by Leigh Day & Co, one of a new \nbreed of environmental law companies that are actively involved in LDCs.  There is also \nin Dhaka the NGOs\u2019 Arsenic and Information Support Unit, a joint venture between \nWaterAid Bangladesh and the NGO Forum for Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation, \nand many other organizations working on practical help for the victims of arsenic \npoisoning.   \n 8\n The spacings of torts are complex.  Although the damage is time-space specific, the \ncausal chain may be lengthy, in the case of Sutradhar v NERC allegedly stretching from \nBangladesh to the BGS headquarters in Nottinghamshire, with intermediation from the \nGoB, the British Government\u2019s ODA, and the NERC.  This particular strand is only one \nin a web of funding bodies, consultants and engineers who were involved with the vast \ntubewell programme in Bangladesh.  \u2018Proximity\u2019 in this case is best interpreted as \ninterconnexions in a global network of information and influence, supporting Gregory\u2019s \n(2004, 249) claim that \u2018distance is never an absolute, fixed and frozen, and within the \ncolonial present, like the colonial past, the power to transform distance\u2026is typically \narrogated by metropolitan cultures\u2019.   \n \nWhat then of the intersecting skeins of responsibility that constitute the globalised \nsystem of aid and consultancy?  They are so complex that Beck (1999, 55) has called the \ndifficulty of attributing blame a \u2018travesty of the hazard technocracy\u2019 because \u2018if it is \nnecessary to name one and only one actor, in the overwhelming majority of cases no \nactor can be named\u2019.  But each transaction, whether economic or scientific, is potentially \ndamaging and therefore carries with it a latent liability, and the law of torts may therefore \nprovide an answer for Beck\u2019s problem.  If it ever breaks through into the mainstream of \nquotidian international relations, it will fundamentally change the relationship between \npatrons and clients from one of caveat emptor (consumer beware) to caveat venditor (provider \nbeware).  Few outside the realms of socio-legal scholarship have thought of the world as \nlegally inscribed in this way but, in one sense, we are identifying a future action-oriented \njustice that might put a measure of power into the hands of the wronged.  Torts also, \nbecause compensation is involved, allocate a price to damage and therefore create a \nmarket that values environmental harm.  Some argue that torts are preferable to the \nregulatory regime of international institutions in that they address harm in place-based \ncontexts because they function at the human scale of the individual and the community \n(Anderson 2002).   \n \nThe body-environment nexus \nKroll-Smith and Westervelt (2004) cite American cases that illustrate the ready \npermeability of the boundary between bodies and nature.  They discuss mainly pollution \nby dangerous manufactured chemicals, but we might add chemicals used in food \n 9\nmanufacture, chemicals such as fluoride that have been deliberately introduced to the \nhuman environment with a view to some beneficial effect, and natural toxins that \nadversely affect human health (Thornton 2000).  Arsenic is an example of the last \ncategory.  It is one of the commonest elements, being widely dispersed in low \nconcentrations in the environment, and traces are therefore present in our normal diet.  \nIt only becomes dangerous in food and water above critical concentrations, which for \nwater was recently reconfirmed by the World Health Organization as ten parts per billion \n(WHO 2004). A shocking aspect of the arsenic crisis in Bangladesh is that it affects \nsomewhere between 28 and 57 million people, many of whom it is thought will develop \ninternal cancers as a result of years of consuming contaminated tubewell water (BGS and \nDPHE 2001).14  This is \u2018the largest mass poisoning of a population in history\u2019 (Smith et \nal. 2000, 1093).   \n \nA problem with such superlatives of disaster is the degree to which expert advice about \nbody-environment links is admissible in court (Browne et al. 1998).  The notorious \nUnited States Supreme Court judgement of Daubert v Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc (1993) \nadded in this respect a filter that has significantly influenced the law of torts in that \ncountry, with implications further afield (Edmond and Mercer 2004).  The justices \nrequired that judges in future must screen the quality of experts called by both sides, with \na view to admitting only reliable testimony.  This sounds reasonable, especially when one \nconsiders that many of the so-called \u2018experts\u2019 called to the witness stand have in the past \noften been poorly qualified to give an opinion (Huber 1991), but the outcome in practice \nhas been to disadvantage plaintiffs.  Where the science is indeterminate, controversial, \nunsettled, or causal links are difficult to establish, it is not easy to persuade judges to take \na case seriously, for instance in complex diseases that have a long period of latency.  \nArsenicosis is one such disease, and we might add that the problems of plaintiffs are \nmultiplied if they are poor, non-literate and perhaps from a country lacking a depth of \nexperience in environmental law (Kanner 2004).  All of these disadvantages apply to the \nBangladeshi arsenic sufferers, who are nearly all poor rural people.  Due to inadequate \nnutrition, and a high consumption of water in the tropical heat, their bodies are more \nopen than most to the insidious poisoning of arsenic (Smith et al. 2000), yet their access \nto environmental justice is limited, both in Bangladesh and in foreign courts where \nDaubert-like attitudes prevail. \n \n 10\nEnvironmental legal strategies \nStrategic thinking has become an important part of environmental citizenship in the \nglobal North.  New social movements and environmental lobby groups have achieved \nmuch in the last twenty years by protests that have been focussed, targeted and \ncoordinated.  Toffolon-Weiss and Roberts (2004) discuss legal strategising with regard to \nenvironmental litigation.  Suing for damage from a toxic tort is not, in their experience, \nsufficient.  The evidence of cases in Louisiana indicates that four ingredients are required \nfor success.  First, framing a message is important, with respect to the particular \ngrievance and the goals for action.  Second, alignment with other interest groups is \nusually of mutual benefit, especially where the partner is a national or international \norganization, such as Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth, with experience and resources.  \nThird, a legal strategy is essential, in order to decide whom to sue and in which court.  \nBoth of these have been difficult to decide in the case of arsenic.  Should the GoB be \nheld responsible, or its western expert advisers, or the funders of the tubewell \ntechnology?  Should the case be brought in Bangladesh or overseas in a court with \ngreater perceived sympathy for environmental justice and the power to impose punitive \ndamages?  Fourth, a protest strategy is indispensable.  Toffolon-Weiss and Roberts found \nthat high profile media campaigns and disruptive civil disobedience are particularly \neffective in getting the attention of the courts and increasing the likelihood of a \nsatisfactory outcome.  Such performative citizenship is part of what may be termed a \nmarketing campaign for environmental issues. The ability to plan, coordinate and execute \nsuch strategies will depend to a certain extent upon the cohesiveness of what \nFreudenberg (1997) and Picou et al. (2004) have called \u2018corrosive communities\u2019.  These \nare groups of people who have been thrown together, usually by the chronic impact of \nsimilar torts, and whose identity and dynamic is shaped by factors such as their collective \nphysical and mental health, their anger at the system failure of institutions, and the length \nof the litigation in which they are involved.   \n \nAlthough the Bangladeshi arsenic case shows some signs of strategic planning, one \nsuspects that this has been mainly top-down.  Well-intentioned environmental lawyers \nhave played an important role, along with local and international NGOs.  There has been \nmedia coverage but, with honourable exceptions, it has more been in the mode of \ndisaster reporting than explorations of the underlying issues.  Collective protests and \nperformative action by the members of corrosive communities has been minimal other \n 11\nthan in the commencement of legal action in the British courts.  As we will see, even this \nseems to be on shaky ground, not yet having come to trial.   \n \nToxic torts:  Sutradhar v NERC \nDenunciation of a guilty party has not been straightforward in the case of arsenic in \nBangladesh.  There were many stakeholders involved in the provision of clean water, \nfrom technical experts and funders to policy-makers and well engineers.  Who among \nthem is to blame?  When it became clear in the 1990s that there was a major \nenvironmental health crisis emerging, it was UNICEF that the Ministry of Environment \nand the Department of Public Health Engineering first thought of suing (Anon 1999).  \nThis was because UNICEF has provided funds for the sinking of up to one million \ntubewells since 1972 (Mahmud and Capella 1999; Smith et al. 2000).  D\u2019Monte (2004) has \nreported that a senior health official of the GoB claimed at a meeting of Asian \nenvironmental journalists in Comilla that Bangladesh was \u2018a victim of UNICEF \naggression\u2019 and that the arsenic poisoning was a case of \u2018criminal negligence\u2019.  There is \nno hint, however, in UNICEF publications devoted to their contribution to water \ndevelopment in the region, of any sense of guilt or culpability (UNICEF 2000).  \nAccording to Pearce (2001), UNICEF\u2019s usual defence is that \u2018at the time, standard \nprocedures for testing the safety of groundwater did not include tests for arsenic [which] \nhad never before been found in the kind of geological formations that exist in \nBangladesh.\u2019 In any case, 90 per cent of tubewells are privately owned, so UNICEF and \nother funders only started and encouraged what became largely a popular movement of \nself-provisioning (BAMWSP 2004), and, ultimately, UNICEF has global legal immunity \nas part of the United Nations family of institutions.15 \n \nA possible model for litigation is the Bhopal disaster.  This was a chemical leak in 1984 \nfrom a Union Carbide factory in India that was responsible for the deaths of thousands, \nimmediately and in the twenty year aftermath.  The Indian government assumed \nresponsibility for suing the transnational corporation, and this was done initially in the \nAmerican courts (Xue 2003).  However, the GoB has not shown any resolve for \nmounting a similar action and all of the legal proceedings have so far been privately \ninitiated (Murshid 2004).  First, in 1999 the prominent Advocate, Rabia Bhuiyan, applied \nto the Bangladesh High Court for a writ to force the GoB to show cause why they \nshould not halt the installation of further tubewells when they knew about arsenic-\n 12\ncontaminated groundwater.16 Soon after, Brotee, a campaigning NGO in Dhaka, made a \nsimilar writ application and in July 2001 the government was instructed to respond;17 \nthen in August 2005 the Supreme Court in Dhaka directed the GoB to implement its \nown National Arsenic Mitigation Policy and Plan and to honour its legal duty to provide \nsafe water (Anon 2005).18   \n \nThese positive developments in Dhaka are part of a dual strategy adopted by \nBangladesh\u2019s environmental justice organizations.  In addition to legal action in \nBangladesh, they spotted a potential opening in the international dimension of aid and \nconsultancy that is so intimately entwined with every aspect of development in that \ncountry.  In May and July 2001 a team of solicitors from the British firm of Leigh Day & \nCo met fifteen arsenic victims in two villages of Chandpur district (Mortoza 2003).  Its \npartners in Bangladesh are Brotee, BELA, the Dhaka Community Hospital, and the \nBangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (Anon 2001; Anon 2002).  Brotee were aiming \nfor compensatory payments of at least \u00a35,000 per head for the victims they had \nidentified (Anon 2003).  Legal action was started in London in August 2002 (Leigh Day \n& Co 2004) on behalf of 512 clients alleging negligence by the BGS in the execution of \ntheir 1992 survey.  The BGS report purported to comment on the quality of groundwater \nbut, despite testing for 31 trace elements, did not look for a contaminant, arsenic, that \nhad been found in other parts of the country and was listed by the WHO \u2018Guidelines for \ndrinking water quality\u2019 as a hazard in drinking water.  A sample case was issued in the \nname of Binod Sutradhar, asserting that he had suffered personal injury as a result of \ndrinking the water, and in February 2003 a further case was lodged for Mrs Lucky \nBegum.19   \n \nIn May 2003 the High Court in London gave permission for this case to go to trial \n(Bachtold 2003).  The Bangladeshis were hoping that eventually it would be possible to \nbring a class action involving hundreds or thousands of those who have the symptoms of \narsenicosis.  Much depended on whether the BGS (through the NERC) owed these \nwater consumers \u2018a duty of care\u2019.20  The British courts have hitherto dealt with such cases \nof environmental justice mainly in terms of nuisance and negligence (Pugh and Criddle \n2004).  Counsel on behalf of the claimant here argued a failure of a duty of care.  Davies \nand Exley were accused of not mentioning arsenic, not because that particular element \nwas itemised in the brief, it was not, but because the study aimed to understand \u2018the \n 13\nmodes of occurrence of trace elements that may be toxic to biological systems\u2019. 21  \nAccording to Mr Sutradhar, \u2018in 1992 the possibility of arsenic being present in the \ngroundwater should have been known to reasonably competent hydrogeologists\u2019.22  If \nthe report was not intended as an analysis of the potability of water, then that should \nhave been made clear. Sharmeen Murshid (n.d. 1) goes further  \n \u2018The arsenic crisis in Bangladesh is a classical example of negligence and \ndistorted development policies.  Both governments and international agencies \nmust share the blame and must be made accountable for [their] actions\u2019. \n \nIn response, the NERC defended the BGS by stating that, as far as they were concerned, \nthey owed no duty of care to Mr Sutradhar and Mrs Begum, nor, by implication, to any \nof the other consumers of water in Bangladesh (BGS 2001, NERC 2005).  The 1992 \nreport was prepared for the ODA and there were no contractual arrangements with any \norganization in Bangladesh.  The work was part of an agricultural irrigation project and, \nas such, had nothing to do with drinking water.  The BGS had no relationship with the \nclaimants, who were anyway unaware that the report existed and therefore could not \nhave made any decisions about their water supply based upon it.  The NERC also \nreminded the court that they were \u2018not responsible for the presence of arsenic in the \nwater and had no responsibility for removing the arsenic\u2019 and, anyway, they had at no \ntime certified the water as fit for human consumption.  In their opinion \u2018no reasonably \nexperienced researcher would have tested for the presence of arsenic in this location \nwithout some special reason to do so\u2019 (NERC 2003).23 \n \nDuring the High Court hearing the claimant argued that the NERC had withheld \nmaterial documentation.  Mr Justice Simon decided that this was true and that a fuller \nanalysis of the case at trial was therefore justified.   \n \nIn February 2004 the Court of Appeal disagreed with the lower court and struck out the \nclaim, chiefly on the grounds of a lack of proximity between the parties.24  Legally, \nproximity may involve closeness in space and time but mainly addresses other aspects of \nthe relationship between parties, for instance the close association between a parent and \na child, a solicitor and a client, or a food manufacturer and a consumer (NERC 2005).  \nBecause proximity, or \u2018neighbourhood\u2019 as it is sometimes called, is contingent upon the \nfacts of each case, the courts have tended to rely incrementally upon the precedent of \n 14\ncase law rather than any precise definition or foundational principle.  Having said that, \n\u2018foreseeability\u2019 of the damage is generally thought of as a necessary condition, in this case \nreferring to the reasonable likelihood that the 1992 BGS report would be shown to the \nBangladeshi authorities responsible for ensuring a safe water supply in the study region \nas a basis for action.   \n \nIn the Court of Appeal, the three judges delivered technical judgements that had little \nfactual or abstract moral content.  Lord Justice Kennedy\u2019s commentary was divided into \nwhat he called \u2018the construction issue\u2019 and \u2018the proximity issue\u2019. On the former, he \nremarked that the report was clearly not intended as a comprehensive and definitive \nstatement of water standards and, on the latter, he concluded that the BGS had \u2018no duty \nto provide the claimant or his fellow citizens with potable water.  They had no power to \ndo so, and they could not even warn him of any dangers\u2019.  Lord Justice Wall agreed and \nsaid that these points were sufficient to strike out the appeal, but Lord Justice Clarke \ndemurred in his minority judgement.  He attached particular weight to the statement of \nDr Sara Bennett, a Canadian environmental specialist consulting on Bangladesh\u2019s \nNortheast Regional Water Management Plan, who pointed out that the GoB relies \nheavily upon foreign organizations for data gathering and analysis, with the implication \nthat the 1992 report was therefore in close associative proximity to their decision-making \nprocesses.  Lord Justice Clarke did not give any indication that he favoured Sutradhar\u2019s \ncase but he perceived in its element of proximity sufficient novelty to recommend a trial \nin this developing area of jurisprudence.  For him the case of the NERC was weak in as \nmuch as: \n\u2018the citizens of Bangladesh like the claimants were (at least potentially) so closely \nand directly affected by the negligent act or omission of the defendant in failing \nto test for arsenic and\/or, having done so, in failing to make it clear to the reader \nof the 1992 report that there might be trace elements (including arsenic) not \ntested for which might pose a hazard to human health, that it ought reasonably to \nhave had them in contemplation when deciding what to test for and how to \nreport the results\u2019. \n \nLord Justice Wall said that at first he had agreed with Lord Justice Clarke but then had \nchanged his mind on hearing the arguments of counsel.  The basis for this was that the \n 15\nprecedent cases were in his opinion not sufficiently favourable for a definition of \nproximity broad enough for Mr Sutradhar\u2019s case. \n \nAs a result of this judgement, the legal position for the time being seems to be that \nconsultants are not legally liable in development aid situations \u2018because of the geography, \nchain of dealings, and supposedly the need to protect the future provision of \ndevelopment aid funds which may become restricted if legal claims arise in respect of \nservices provided\u2019 (Michalowska 2004).  Beck (1999) predicted exactly this kind of \noutcome due to the \u2018risk society\u2019s\u2019 \u2018organized irresponsibility\u2019, where attribution of \nresponsibility has become increasingly difficult in complex technological systems. \n \nIt might be thought that the legal action was therefore pointless and achieved nothing.  It \nis true that the complainants have so far gone empty-handed but they and those \nsympathetic to their action will have noted the minority judgement by Lord Justice \nClarke and the opening out of the issues has certainly been of significance for a number \nof reasons.  First, the very notions of a duty of care and of proximity are now higher on \nthe agenda of environmental law than they were before and, in the very process of \nholding the NERC to account, Mr Sutradhar and Mrs Begum have been producing \nnatures radically different from our previous understandings (Delaney 2001).  These were \nsubtly differentiated in the advocacy of the top silks Hon. Michael Beloff QC and Lord \n(Dan) Brennan QC, and also in the majority and minority judgements, and whether one \nfavours the claimants or not, it seems likely that the arguments deployed on their behalf \nwill appear again in future cases, with outcomes that will vary with different \nconstructions of the balance between rights and responsibilities, with the varying \ninstitutional settings and, of course, with the diverse socio-natures on trial.   \n \nSecond, however, whether one likes it or not, the epistemological singularities of the law \nhave been imprinted upon environmental issues.  Thus, Valverde (2003) and other \nsociologists of the legal process have revealed how court room knowledge is a curious \nhybrid of witness statements and facts gleaned from expert testimony, comprising that \nquasi-transcendental entity, \u2018common knowledge\u2019. In the case of torts, the bar for \nscientific evidence tends to be set high because such an elevated value is placed upon the \nexpert views. This tends to favour the global corporation or the scientific institution, \nwith their teams of professionally plausible experts, against the ordinary consumer \n 16\ncitizen, so we hold out no immediate hope that Sutradhar v NERC can make a difference \nunless the House of Lords is willing to allow it to come to trial.  In January 2005 their \nAppellate Committee granted permission for a hearing, likely to take place in mid-2006 \nbut, even if they overrule the Court of Appeal, a trial in the High Court would be two \nyears away.25  Because the House of Lords provides a function of clarifying the general \nprinciples of law, they may well decide that a trial would serve the public interest.26  They \nare not bound by precedent in quite the same way as lower courts and are therefore more \nopen to new and innovatory ideas. \n \nEthics and proximity \nThe ethics of proximity are far from straightforward.  According to Lord Atkin, in a \nclassic judgement,  \n\u2018The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must \nnot injure your neighbour; and the lawyer\u2019s question, \u201cwho is my \nneighbour?\u201d receives a restricted reply.\u2019  \nHe argued that a duty care means that: \n\u2018You must take reasonable care to avoid acts and omissions which you \ncan reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, \nthen, in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be \u2013 persons who \nare so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably \nhave them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing \nmy mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.\u201927 \nThe definition of a neighbour and of his\/her proximity is therefore crucial. Smith (1998, \n18) sets out the Aristotelian origins of the notion that \u2018extreme distance leads to \nindifference, while extreme closeness can lead to pity, or to such other emotions as envy \nand destructive rivalry: part of the everyday experience of face-to-face society\u2019.   \nBoltanski (1993, 16) discusses this in the light of the global reach of the media and \nproblematizes spectatorship in order to understand the link between the politics of pity \nand the politics of action.  He makes a similar point: \n\u2018The person who sees from afar is unaware of other people receiving the news, \nhow near they are relative to the case, their readiness to act and whether or not \nthey have pre-commitments.  Each is thereby uncertain as to the existence of a \nranked series of persons under an obligation to act to different degrees, as to \n 17\ntheir possible position in this series, and as to the failure to act of possible helpers \nhigher up in the series for whom they would have to become substitutes\u2019.28 \n \nOn the other hand, Singer (1979, 2004), Corbridge (1993), Rawls (1999), Smith (2000), \nFollesdal and Pogge (2005), and Pogge (2006) and many others restate the principles of \nuniversal, non-localized obligations and human rights. Without such obligations, \ninternational relations, at both state and non-state levels, would diverge irreconcilably \nfrom egalitarian ideas of justice.  They would also ignore the essential geographical \nobservation that people\u2019s misfortunes often relate to their location, which in turn is a \nfunction of the contingencies of historical geography (Smith 1998).  \n \nRorty (1989) would have us believe that meaning is derived from hope.  Because of our \ncommitment, like him, to certain aspects of pragmatism, we agree but wish to add an \nemphasis on action and practice (Atkins et al. 2006b).  This may be the place-specific, \nintegrative conduct stressed by Cutchin (1999, 268) as promoting \u2018the situational, \ndeliberative, active, moral components of health and health care\u2019, but it may also be \naction at a scale that crosses continents.  Denying responsibility because of an absence of \nimmediacy of spatial association becomes morally indefensible if we reject the simplistic \nidea of proximity as co-presence and see it instead in its full complexity as networked \nassociation.  At present the aid industry is using state institutions as holding companies \nor clearing houses of responsibility, in a way that enables a deniability of proximity.  If \nthere are sufficient steps in between the end user and the service provider, it is unlikely at \npresent that anyone can be held to account.  What is required, therefore, is the further \ndevelopment and maturing of the concept of proximity.  Judicial commentaries on \nSutradhar v NERC retain traces of a pre-modern law of torts, where the idea of action at a \ndistance had yet to be assimilated, let alone any concept of global action.  In order to \nguard against Habermas\u2019s concerns about the possibility of judicial tyranny, that judges \ntend to act according to their own interests and of the system that they serve (Ingram \n2002), we need what Rorty (1980) calls a \u2018cosmopolitan conversation of humankind\u2019 in \norder to establish the pragmatic parameters that will redefine proximity in the interests of \nglobal environmental justice.   \n \nMissing from the judgements of both the High Court and the Court of Appeal is any \nappreciation of the reality of \u2018action at a distance\u2019 in the worlds of environmental \n 18\nconsultancy and international aid, or, for that matter, of the global reach of transnational \ncapitalism.  Sutradhar v NERC is an opportunity to debate this issue, and a more nuanced \nnotion of proximity that would, in our opinion, be bound to eventuate.  From a \ngeographical point of view, Mason (2001, 422) has argued that \u2018the growth of \ninternational law attests to the unbundling of sovereign authority for environmental \ngovernance, allowing new interstices of accountability\u2019, and it could be argued that \nresponsibility for the arsenic poisoning of millions of people in Bangladesh can be \nunderstood only in terms of theoretical contexts that are very different from the spaces \nof scientific and legal realism. \n \nTorts, proximity and legal geographies \nThere have been various suggestions recently to provide a different vision of torts, toxic \nand otherwise.  Berger (1997), for instance, argues that reliance upon expert scientific \nevidence to establish causal proof of harm has been an encumbrance to justice.  Thus \nepidemiological evidence is treated with scepticism by judge and jury, and often with \ngood reason because proof of causation is exceptionally difficult when cancers, for \ninstance, can have several origins.  In the case of arsenic there is no single signature \nsymptom that is derived solely from that source, so establishing a link is difficult with a \nlevel of probability that would satisfy a statistician.  In addition, she argues for a \nfundamental overhaul of torts because of \u2018the present system\u2019s indifference to creating \nadequate inducements, short of litigation, to goad [polluters] into gathering the data and \nfunding the research that [is] essential to identifying and assessing potential risks\u2019 (Berger \n1997, 2131).  She proposes that knowledge is so uncertain that the law should shift from \nproof of causality, always a problem for poor litigants and therefore a key issue in the \n\u2018environmental justice\u2019, towards a duty of care.  This would require the corporation, \ngovernment or institution to undertake research and provide information relating to risk.  \nIf due care is exercised in this way, then there would be no liability for injuries caused by \npollution or dangerous products; the consumer or bystander would have been warned \nand would therefore have to bear the consequences. But if research was inadequate or \nnot disseminated, the polluter would have to pay compensation.  There are several issues \nhere.  First, in non-literate societies with weak systems of communication, how could the \npublic be informed?  Second, in information-rich societies might there not be an \noverload of risk data for individual citizens?  Third, informational spaces and hazardous \nspaces have become complex in the era of global risks.  \n 19\n Even more fundamental is Desmond Manderson\u2019s (2006) reinterpretation of torts \nalong the lines of proximity in the thought of Emmanuel L\u00e9vinas.  In this formulation, \nproximity is seen as fundamental to ethics and also to the common law, and, in as \nmuch as legal geographies are elaborations of the nuances of proximity, they are \ntherefore a key to both.  L\u00e9vinas wrote of proximity, not in the calculative terms of \nLord Atkin, but as an \u2018event that takes place prior to our having any categories in \nwhich to confine it\u2019 (Manderson 2006, 178).  It is constitutive of subjectivity, in its \npassive mode at least, which is always built in relation to the \u2018other\u2019 (Campbell 1999).  \nIt is not the result of choice or reason but comes as a surprise to both plaintiff and \ndefendant.  Manderson therefore rejects the fiction of forseeability, and the implicitly \nrequired foreknowledge of those affected by a tort, in favour of the element of \nnegligence called \u2018breach\u2019, a failure of the non-contractual duty of care potentially owed \nto the rest of the world.  Here he is reflecting the L\u00e9vinasian definition of proximity as \narising \u2018not from my choices or foresight, nor from our policies, but from your \nvulnerability\u2019 (Manderson 2006, 176).  Through this insight, Mr Sutradhar is in \nproximity to the NERC through his asymmetric relationship with them and a capacity to \nbe harmed that he could not avoid.   \n \nManderson goes on to argue that we must focus on the relationship between the \nparties and \u2018the power and the passivity of their dynamic\u2019.  He suggests that the \nquestion of proximity \u2018will only be resolved by a greater concentration on the actual \nand lived connection between the two, and not by a greater abstraction\u2019 (2006, 172).  \nLegal geographies present an opportunity here at scales ranging from the local to the \nglobal. One possible approach is via gift theory, especially in the poststructural \nversions that involve high levels of mutuality between parties (Silk 2004, Barnett \n2005).  Another might be, as hinted above, a theory of networked, associative \nproximity. \n \nConclusion \nIf the House of Lords sends this case to trial, it may yet turn out to be a landmark.  The \nNERC was sued in the negligence element of the law relevant to environmental torts.29  \nWhile some academics and members of the public may have sympathy with Davies and \nExley for being put in the firing line, when they no doubt thought that their 1992 report \n 20\nwas just another scientific report that would have a narrow audience and one that would \nmake a small but positive contribution to the development of Bangladesh, there are \nothers who argue that the full weight of responsibility should be borne by those of us \nwho write such reports or undertake consultancy work in the developing world.  \nCertainly, the concept of proximity has, in our view, scope for revision in the light of the \nethical writings of L\u00e9vinas and poststructural gift theory, and, as a result, legal \ngeographies may in future be propelled into the limelight of debates about torts of \nglobal significance. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe are grateful to Marion O\u2019Sullivan, the NERC\u2019s Press Officer, for arranging for a copy \nof Davies & Exley (1992) to be made available and also for facilitating access to past \npress releases.

The water is pumped up \nfrom the aquifer by means of a handle. \n(http:\/\/banglapedia.search.com.bd\/HT\/T_0240.htm). Accessed 2 February 2006. \n2   Pond and river water was previously used throughout rural Bangladesh, with access \nrestrictions due to distance and ownership that meant inconvenience and hardship, \nparticularly for the ultra poor. \n3   Apart from clean water, the introduction of oral rehydration therapy was also \nimportant. \n4   It is worth noting that exploitation of groundwater suited successive governments in \nthe face of water shortages that were predicted to follow India\u2019s inauguration of the \nFarakka Barrage on the River Ganges in 1975. \n5   The arsenic can be removed but there is no consensus yet on an appropriate \ntechnology to do so at the level of the household.  Although tubewells are entirely \nresponsible for the arsenic pollution, they may still be the best solution because drilling \nto greater depths generally yields safe water.  The piping of water, either to standpipes or \ndirectly to households, is another attractive technology, and here the water might be \nchemically treated or from deep tubewells. \n6   One theory is that anaerobic conditions underground favour the mobilisation of \narsenic, assisted by microbiological reactions in sediments with an organic component.  \nAn alternative is that falling water tables due to excessive pumping has drawn oxygen \ninto the aquifers, thus oxidizing sulphides and releasing arsenic. \n7   (http:\/\/groups.yahoo.com\/group\/arsenic-crisis\/message\/46). Accessed 2 February \n2006. \n8   An approach is also mooted to the International Court of Justice in The Hague \n(Mortoza 2003). \n9   Bronwen Morgan (2004) argues that, while the rhetoric of development aid implies \ngenerosity, in the lucrative water industry, power and money are always close to issues \nsuch as privatization of state assets in developing countries. This commodification has \nbrought with it bitter contestation from citizen groups (Morgan 2006). \n10   There have also been calls for a World Environmental Organization (Bierman and \nBauer 2005). \n 29\n \n \n11   In negligence, the issue under discussion in the present paper, in British law the \nplaintiff must prove a duty of care, then a breach in that duty and, finally, that loss or \nharm has been suffered. \n12   Holmes enthusiastically based this category on the famous British case of Rylands v \nFletcher (1868), where a mill owner was held to be liable for the flooding of a mine when \nhis reservoir collapsed without warning. \n13   In 2003 BELA was inducted into the United Nations Environment Programme\u2019s \nGlobal 500 Roll of Honour for pioneering activity in public interest environmental \nlitigation. \n14   There is presently a campaign by the Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply \nProject and a host of NGOs to provide alternatives to tubewells.  These include \nimproved versions of the traditional dug wells, sand filters to enable the use of pond \nwater, and the harvesting of rainwater.  Unfortunately there is evidence of arsenic in dug \nwell water in some districts, and well and pond water has low bacteriological quality, so \nthese alternatives are not guaranteed to be risk-free. \n15   Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, adopted by the \nGeneral Assembly in February 1946. \n16   Ms Bhuiyan was the first woman barrister in Bangladesh and has been a member of \nparliament. \n17   At the time of writing (February 2006), no hearing date had yet been set in Brotee\u2019s \naction against the GoB\u2019s Department of Public Health Engineering.  Delays are common \nbecause of a shortage of judges. \n18   Under Article 18 of the Constitution, the government is responsible for ensuring the \npublic health.  This is delegated jointly to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and \nthe Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives.  Clause18 of \nthe first schedule of the Local Government (Union Porishod) Ordinance 1983 prohibits \nthe sinking of tube wells that are dangerous (Murshid 2004).   \n19   Writ Petition No. 2736\/2001, Claim No: HQD2X02630, Binod Sutradhar v The Natural \nEnvironment Research Council [2003] QB. \n20   A duty of care means taking reasonable precautions to avoid acts or omissions that \nwould be likely to injure another. \n21   Case No: A2\/2003\/1148: Sutradhar v NERC [2004] EWCA Civ 175. \n22   Ibid. \n 30\n \n23   According to Murshid (2004), \u2018there has never been a case before in which a party \nwho has undertaken scientific study for a client has been held responsible to a third party \nwho may have sustained injuries as a result of the study not being undertaken or reported \nin a particular way\u2019. \n24   Sutradhar v NERC [2004] EWCA Civ 175. \n25   The Law Lords sitting were Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry \nand Lord Carswell.  The information about timing came by personal communication, 27th \nJanuary 2005, from Mr George Gandy. \n26   Murshid (2004) claims that \u2018this is the first case where a claim raises issues of direct \nversus indirect injury; personal versus economic loss and nature of the duty owed in aid \nprojects to the developing world\u2019. \n27   Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] A.C. 562.  \n28   For further discussion see Chatterjee (2003). \n29   An alternative might have been civil liability in human rights.  Mason (2005) argues \nthat this will provide a fertile ground for claims in future cases of transnational \nenvironmental responsibility. \n"}
