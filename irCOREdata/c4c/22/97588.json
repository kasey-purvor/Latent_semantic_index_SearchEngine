In Cromarty he had the usual advantages and limitations of a local collector far from metropolitan centres. But Miller was different from other collectors: he was author of classic books such as The Old Red Sandstone, making famous the Old Red Sandstone fishes and Jurassic marine fossils of the area around Cromarty.

INTRODUCTION\n. I saw a labourer at work with a pick-axe, in a\nlittle craggy ravine, about a hundred yards to the\nleft of the path, and two gentlemen standing\nbeside him. I paused for a moment, to ascertain\nwhether the latter were not brother-workers in the\ngeologic field. \u2018Hilloa! \u2013 here,\u2019 shouted out the\nstouter of the two gentlemen, as if, by some\nclairvoyant faculty, he had dived into my secret\nthought; \u2018come here.\u2019 I went down into the ravine,\nand found the labourer engaged in disinterring\nichthyolitic nodules out of a bed of gray stratified\nclay. a heap of freshly-broken nodules, speckled\nwith the organic remains of the Lower Old Red\nSandstone, \u2013 chiefly occipital plates and scales, \u2013\nlay beside him. \u2018Know you aught of these?[\u2019] said\nthe stouter gentleman, pointing to the heap. \u2018A\nThis paper is a revised version of one originally presented at\nthe Hugh Miller Bicentenary Conference, organised by the\nCromarty Arts Trust at Cromarty in October 2002 (Borley\n2003) and is an invited addition to the papers arising from the\njoint meeting of the Geological Society of London History of\nGeology Group and the Geologists\u2019 Association, The Ama-\nteur in British Geology, held at The Geological Society,\nBurlington House, London, 14\u201315 March, 2002.\nProceedings of the Geologists\u2019 Association, 117, 85\u201398. 0016-7878\/06 $15.00 \u0001 2006 Geologists\u2019 Association\nlittle,\u2019 I replied; \u2018but your specimens are none of\nthe finest. Here, however, is a dorsal plate of\nCoccosteus; and here a scattered group of scales\nof Osteolepis; and here the occipital plates of\nCheirolepis Cummingi\u00e6; and here the spine of the\nanterior dorsal of Diplacanthus Striatus.\u2019 My\nreading of the fossils was at once recognized, like\nthe mystic sign of the freemason, as establishing\nfor me a place among the geologic brotherhood;\nand the stout gentleman producing a spirit-flask\nand a glass, I pledged him and his companion in a\nbumper. \u2018Was I not sure?\u2019 he said, addressing his\nfriend: \u2018I knew by the cut of his jib, notwithstand-\ning his shepherd\u2019s plaid, that he was a wanderer of\nthe scientific cast.\u2019 We discussed the peculiarities\nof the deposit. I showed the younger of the two\ngeologists my mode of breaking open an ichthy-\nolitic nodule, so as to secure the best possible\nsection of the fish. \u2018Ah,\u2019 he said, as he marked a\nstyle of handling the hammer which, save for the\nfifteen years\u2019 previous practice of the operative\nmason, would be perhaps less complete, \u2013 \u2018Ah,\nyou must have broken open a great many.\u2019 His\nown knowledge of the formation and its ichthyo-\nlites had been chiefly derived, he added, from a\ncertain little treatise on the \u2018Old Red Sandstone\u2019,\nrather popular than scientific, which he named. I\nof course claimed no acquaintance with the work;\nand the conversation went on [From The Cruise of\nthe Betsey, with, Rambles of a Geologist (Miller,\n1858b, pp. 240\u2013241).]\nThe plaid-wearing former stonemason was, of course,\nHugh Miller (1802\u20131856; Figs 1, 2), author of the\nclassic book The Old Red Sandstone, an exquisite study\nof one small corner of Scotland which is to Scottish\ngeology as The Natural History of Selborne is to the\nEnglish countryside. Miller was certainly a very good\ngeologist, as an observer in the field or of the minute\ndetail of his fossils, but he published rather little formal\nacademic geology, contrary to what one might imagine\nfrom his reputation. Therefore, how one regards Mill-\ner\u2019s actual contribution to geology \u2013 or rather palae-\nontology \u2013 is critically dependent on how one defines\nscience (Miller\u2019s contribution is notably discussed by\nOldroyd, 1996; see also Andrews, 1982; Waterston,\n2002a, b; Hudson, 2003; Janvier, 2003; Morrison-Low\n& Nuttall, 2003; Secord, 2003; Taylor, 2003; Torrens,\n2003; Trewin, 2003; Anderson, 2005). Indeed, from the\npoint of view of the metropolitan \u00e9lite of the Geologi-\ncal Society of London, Miller would simply have been\nyet another talented provincial collector, if one who\nwas rather good at popularizing the science (Knell,\n2000, pp. 148\u2013149).\nMiller did his collecting in his spare time, for he was\nprimarily busy with other occupations. First a stone-\nmason, then a bank accountant, he became the editor\nof an important, and politically independent, Scottish\nnewspaper, The Witness, where he played a major part\nin the disputes over control of the Church of Scotland;\nMiller supported the Church\u2019s independence and had\nmuch to do with the founding of the Free Church of\nScotland in 1843. More generally he supported the\nFig. 1. Statue of Hugh Miller in his characteristic outdoors\nLowlander Scots dress by Amelia Paton Hill, exhibited at the\nRoyal Scottish Academy, 1869 (title given as \u2018The late Mr\nHugh Miller, author of The Old Red Sandstone\u2019 in Baile de\nLaperri\u00e8re, 1991, p. 288). It must surely portray Miller\ndiscovering his eponymous Pterichthys milleri at the Old Red\nSandstone fish locality on the beach at Cromarty; the split\nnodule with the fossil, half in hand and half at feet, is typical\nof the Cromarty site, as is the coarse conglomerate boulder\n\u2018supporting\u2019 him. (There is a di\ufb00erent statue, by Handyside\nRitchie, on the monument at Cromarty.) Paton was the wife\nof David Octavius Hill who with his partner Robert Adamson\ncreated the deservedly famous \u2018calotype\u2019 photos of Hugh\nMiller and many of their contemporaries. Miller also features\nprominently in Hill and Paton\u2019s famous \u2018Disruption Painting\u2019\nof the formation of the Free Church in 1843, The Signing of\nthe Deed of Demission (Stevenson, 2002).

TAYLOR86\ntraditional role of the Kirk in everyday life, although\nhe was never an uncritical mouthpiece of the Kirk\u2019s\nmanagers; for instance, he favoured care of the deserv-\ning poor, old and infirm through the Kirk in the\ntraditional manner, but \u2013 contrary to what those\nunfamiliar with Miller might expect \u2013 he was in favour\nof a State-controlled and non-sectarian educational\nsystem, if one still based on Presbyterian Christian\nmores (Robb, 1996).\nBut Miller\u2019s bookish childhood and varied occupa-\ntions made him a very unusual part-time geologist. His\njournalistic competence, superb literary skills, lively\ninterest in many subjects and Presbyterian credentials\nmade him an important advocate for geology, es-\npecially amongst people who read his books for other\nreasons (O\u2019Connor, 2003a, b; Secord, 2003). At the\nsame time he was an advocate, and indeed a living\nexemplar, of education and self-help in the best Victo-\nrian manner (which was in any case something of an\nold Scots tradition). In The Old Red Sandstone, and in\nhis wonderfully ironically titled autobiography My\nSchools and Schoolmasters, Miller recommended ge-\nology as an excellent example of the kind of improving\nand constructive recreation which anyone at any level\nof society could and should take up. This was, more-\nover, at a time when geology and biology posed\nimportant questions about the literal truth of the Bible,\nthe nature of divine creation and the origin of human-\nity. Indeed, contrary to the common modern miscon-\nception, Miller was no literalist interpreter of the Bible\nwhen it came to geology.\nMiller espoused his unique brand of \u2018literary ge-\nology\u2019 amongst the many kinds of geologist then\npractising the new science (Knell, 2000), from the\nwidely denigrated Biblical literalists and the dilettante\ngentlemen collectors to the rising professionals to be\nfound in the museum, university and geological survey.\nHis penetrating insight and apt comments still delight\nthe reader today, even on such unpromising themes as\nfailed coal mines (Torrens, 2003), or when he provides\nthe historian with a stylish mot juste, as when consid-\nering the relationship of geology and archaeology\n(Torrens, 1998).\nIt is never easy to measure someone\u2019s impact on the\nwider public, outside the formal debates and publica-\ntions of learned societies, especially as it depends so\nmuch on the individual reader, as shown by Secord\n(2000) for Miller\u2019s opponent, Robert Chambers, the\nevolutionist. Miller was certainly no mere popularizer;\nrather, he was a literary man in the wide, all-\nencompassing Victorian sense (O\u2019Connor, 2003a, b)\nand richly aware of the Scottish literary tradition\n(Robertson, 2002). Yet it is known that Miller turned\nsome \u2013 and perhaps many \u2013 individuals, often in\nisolated communities, towards geology. Oldroyd\n(1996) rightly claims that, in a sense, Miller\u2019s greatest\nfind was Archibald Geikie (1835\u20131924), often regarded\nas the science\u2019s figurehead in the late nineteenth cen-\ntury, whom Miller had personally encouraged to take\nup geology. There was seemingly a generation whose\nimagination Miller\u2019s elegant prose captured for ge-\nology. John Muir (1838\u20131914), the \u00e9migr\u00e9 Scottish\u2013\nAmerican pioneer of environmental conservation, read\nMiller as a young man and named an Alaskan glacier\nafter Miller (Taylor, 2002a; Lowenthal, 2003). George\nJennings Hinde (1839\u20131918), a pioneer of micropalae-\nontology and its use in stratigraphy, came to geology\nas a result of reading Miller\u2019s works (Woodward,\n1918).\nMiller managed his working life carefully to give\nhimself opportunity to write on his favourite subject.\nHe had long held literary desires and, consequently,\nthe geology he produced was unlike that of his con-\ntemporaries. He had geological friends (Collie, 2003)\nand he did not disdain organized societies \u2013 he was\nactive in the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh, one\nof the obvious local venues for geology (Taylor 2002b,\nc) \u2013 but he was a long way from the metropolitan\nsavants of the Geological Society of London, in more\nsenses than one.\nMiller has never, in fact, been quite forgotten \u2013 his\nmemory has been preserved, for instance by geologists\nand, also, especially, by the folk of Miller\u2019s birthplace,\nFig. 2.

Meanwhile,\nMiller\u2019s statue on the monument above the town looks\nout to the site of his classic discoveries in the Old Red\nSandstone.\nHowever, there has recently been more interest in\nScottish history and culture and, independently, also in\npre-Darwinian science and thought. This has encour-\naged wider interest in and a reassessment of Miller,\nespecially after the bicentenary of his birth in 2002 and\nthe associated events co-ordinated by the Cromarty\nArts Trust, notably the meetings now published as\nBorley (2002, 2003).\nRepository abbreviation.

CONSIDERING THE FOSSIL DISCOVERER\nAND COLLECTOR\nThis paper is concerned with Hugh Miller\u2019s geological\ncollection: the fossils he discovered, how he found\nthem, what they meant to him and how he used them.\nWe consider Miller\u2019s usage of fossils as objects of the\nmaterial culture of his day and, by taking that point of\nview, we are explicitly including science in that culture,\nwith sometimes surprising results. This territory was\nexplored in some depth by Paradis (1996) in Shortland\n(1996). Miller\u2019s autobiographical mode of writing\nmeans that our paper also overlaps, for instance, with\nAlston\u2019s interest in Miller\u2019s local context in Cromarty\nand Vincent\u2019s work on his self-cultivation and devel-\nopment (Alston, 1996; Vincent, 1996). This paper does\nnot discuss Miller\u2019s important contribution, partly\nbased on his fossil collection, to the progress of formal\nscientific thought, as this has been well reviewed by\nDavid Oldroyd and others (Oldroyd, 1996).\nHugh Miller poses an obvious historiographic prob-\nlem, a di\ufb03culty in the practice of history, partly\nbecause of the breadth of his interests which he\nbrought before the public eye in his writings. As a\nconsequence, di\ufb00erent commentators have read Miller\nquite di\ufb00erently. Of course, many of his contemporar-\nies also had diverse interests (Knell, 2000). For\nexample, George Cumberland of Bristol has been\nviewed quite separately as an artist\u2019s friend, antiquar-\nian and geologist, while the Marquis of Northampton\nhas been seen as politician, tourist, landowner, collec-\ntor and patron of science. However, neither made\nmuch of a literary mark. Few nineteenth-century ge-\nologists were as single-minded as histories often seem\nto imply. But few of Miller\u2019s geological contemporaries\ndeveloped a public profile in such an array of appar-\nently disparate fields. In Miller\u2019s case these fields\nincluded religion, politics, folklore, geology and jour-\nnalism. Fewer still committed their views to paper and\neven fewer wrote themselves into their work as overtly\nas Miller did. These issues pose challenges to our\ninterpretation of Miller\u2019s intent, particularly given the\nnecessity of often having to rely upon his self-\nportrayal. It is a portrayal laced with the high morality\nof his tales and a liberal application of his own\nhindsight and yet also infused with a dry wit and a\nsubtle irony that modern readers sometimes miss (with\nthe inevitable consequences for their comprehension).\nA second historiographic problem is that there is no\nobvious context in which to place his geological activi-\nties: one has to start from scratch. Nineteenth-century\nEnglish geology had its co-operative and competitive\nelements, whereby middle-class collectors and provin-\ncial men of science sought to establish a position for\nthemselves in society by taking part in science (for\nexamples, see Knell, 2000). This appears to have had\nparallels in Scotland (e.g. Andrews, 1982; Collie, 2003).\nEven in the nineteenth-century English geological\nhotspots of Scarborough and Bristol there was great\nvariation in how individuals engaged morally and\nsocially in scientific activities; but Miller\u2019s social con-\ntext in Cromarty was very di\ufb00erent from those English\nurban centres which were becoming the focus of the\nnew science. Miller\u2019s well-known self-cultivation, with\nits inevitable implications for defining his identity,\nsuggests that he \u2018should\u2019 be just such a conventionally\ncompetitive collector, as one might predict from the\nprevailing Calvinist work ethic; on the other hand,\nMiller\u2019s deep moral beliefs pull us into a completely\ndi\ufb00erent and possibly uncharted territory.\nThe third problem is that, in many ways, Miller is\nperipheral to conventional histories of science. Like\nmany collectors, he risks being marginalized by his\nsocial status and geographical isolation, and the fact\nthat his scientific achievement was (and largely still is)\ncounted in specimens and sites rather than formal\npapers. Even when Miller had established himself as a\ngeological writer, his invocation of God in so many\ndebates, his posthumous association with the losing\nside in the struggle for acceptance of evolutionary\nthought, and his failure to write science in the increas-\ningly formalized manner being adopted as the norm,\nhave all tended to turn Miller into something of a\nVictorian curiosity to modern eyes. Yet Miller was\ncourted by many of the great geologists of his day, few\nof whom, apparently, saw anything particularly odd in\nhis perspective. In contrast, true biblical literalists,\nsuch as the Rev. George Young of Whitby, were\ncastigated for their views even in the 1820s, when\nMiller\u2019s geologizing had scarcely begun. Miller himself\nhad no time for biblical literalists, as is seen very\nclearly in Testimony of the Rocks, especially \u2018Lecture\nTenth. The geology of the anti-geologists\u2019. Arnold\nBennett\u2019s 1910 novel Clayhanger also makes this dis-\ntinction clear, when he describes the reception of\nMiller\u2019s work in the nonconformist Potteries of\nSta\ufb00ordshire:\nS. J. KNELL & M. A. TAYLOR88\n[e]ven Hugh Miller\u2019s The Old Red Sandstone .,\nthen over thirty years old, was still being looked\nupon as dangerously original in the Five Towns in\n1873. However, the e\ufb00ect of its disturbing\ngeological evidence that the earth could scarcely\nhave been begun and finished in a little under a\nweek, was happily nullified by the suicide of its\nauthor; that pistol-shot had been a striking proof\nof the literal inspiration of the Bible (Bennett,\n1954, p. 126).\nThere is plainly a serious anomaly in some \u2013 perhaps\neven all \u2013 modern perceptions of Miller and, although\nthe introduction and many papers in Shortland (1996)\nwent a long way towards addressing this, the issue\nremained open when a diverse group met in Cromarty\nto debate the man in the 2002 bicentenary conference\n(Borley, 2003). These tensions shall be considered\nthrough an analysis of Miller\u2019s collecting and his\nrelationship to the fossil.\n3. THE DEVELOPMENT OF MILLER\u2019S\nCOLLECTING\nIn what way was Miller any di\ufb00erent from others who\nparticipated in science in provincial Britain in the\nsecond quarter of the nineteenth century? To imagine\nHugh Miller on the foreshore collecting his fossils, or\nat home preparing, sorting and storing them, is to\nimagine a scene then common to the many fossil-rich\nareas on Britain\u2019s coasts (Knell, 2000). Geology in its\nvarious guises was an occupation taken up by la-\nbourer, self-improving artisan and middle-class \u2018phil-\nosopher\u2019. Miller was, of course, successively all these\nthings, but in this he was not unique: many others\ncrossed these social boundaries. His uncles James and\nSandy had nurtured the young Miller in local anti-\nquarianism and natural history, but again this was\ncommonly the means by which exceptional talent in\nnatural history was developed \u2013 such sciences were not\nsubjects of formal education. Nor was Miller\u2019s com-\nplex intertwining of geology, fossils and religion\nunique. The explosion of philosophical societies which\nacted as centres for the burgeoning science had in part\nbeen fuelled by a belief in unravelling the Divine plan.\nAnd while Miller\u2019s published writing is indeed distinc-\ntive for its nature, diversity and weight, a sample (those\nin Elgin Museum) of his unpublished letters to his\nfriends suggests that, at least originally, he was a\ntalented but still fairly typical provincial \u2018philosopher\u2019.\nAround Elgin and elsewhere in Britain, collectors were\nracing to establish their scientific reputations through\ntheir discoveries. Miller was not totally detached from\nthis race, but he saw other ways in which to deploy\ngeology in his self-development. Miller stands out, in\nfact, not so much because of what he collected or how\nhe did it \u2013 impressive as his achievements certainly are\n\u2013 but for what he made of what he collected.\nAn individual\u2019s attitudes to things, at least as ma-\nterial objects, change with time, almost by the minute.\nMiller was no di\ufb00erent, but one can perhaps define\nfour phases in his relationship with fossils (data from\nMiller\u2019s own books; Andrews, 1982; Oldroyd, 1996,\nand, for the 1840 date, local newspaper accounts, L.\nBorley, pers. comm., 2003):\n\u2022 1802\u2013c. 1820. The period of his formal education \u2013\nsuch as it was \u2013 and his early self-education. Fossils\nentered his world sporadically but had no revolu-\ntionary e\ufb00ect.\n\u2022 1820\u2013c. 1829. Miller\u2019s interest in fossils developed,\nparticularly \u2013 so he tells us \u2013 after his finding of\n\u2018Liassic\u2019 (actually Upper Jurassic) fossils around\nEathie on the shores of the Moray Firth.\n\u2022 c. 1830\u20131837. Isolated from the wider culture of\nscience, Miller was a \u2018Robinson Crusoe of geology\u2019,\nas he later put it (Miller, 1841, p. 125). In this phase,\nMiller made a serious study of the fossils of his home\narea, making his famous discovery of fossil fishes in\nthe Old Red Sandstone at Cromarty in 1830, initially\ndescribed only briefly in his first book, Scenes and\nLegends (1835), his account of the folklore and\ntraditional history of Cromarty (in later editions the\nfossils were largely edited out; Paradis, 1996). Spo-\nradically he read or heard about current geological\nideas. But he could get relatively little useful special-\nist help and there were no \u2018practical men\u2019 essaying\nthe local rocks for coal (Torrens, 2003). He remained\nfor practical purposes out of contact with other\ncollectors such as those in the Moray Firth area.\n\u2022 1837\u20131856. In 1837, Miller meets Patrick Du\ufb00 and\nthe Elgin geologists and \u2013 crucially \u2013 John Malcol-\nmson, the East India Company doctor who had been\ndrawn to Cromarty by mention of fossils in Scenes\nand Legends. Helped by Malcolmson, Miller pro-\ngressively entered the broader cultural world of\ngeology. The growth of his network was accelerated\nby his move to Edinburgh in 1840 to take up his\nposition as Editor of The Witness. He also gained\nrecognition (in his absence) at the meeting of the\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science\nin Glasgow in 1840, which also widened his contacts\namongst the scientific \u00e9lite. Miller now had access to\nlibraries and techniques such as thin sectioning,\nwhich would enable him to further his science (Hud-\nson, 2003; Morrison-Low & Nuttall, 2003).\n4. WHAT MILLER COLLECTED\nMiller\u2019s fossil collection started with his finds from the\nUpper Jurassic (to him, the Lower Jurassic \u2018Lias\u2019) and\nthe Old Red Sandstone around his home town of\nCromarty and neighbouring areas of the Black Isle and\nthe Seaboard of Easter Ross to the north of the\nCromarty Firth. To this Cromarty-centred core, from\nthe start of 1840, Miller added material from around\nhis new home city of Edinburgh (it is not clear how\nmuch he collected when working as a stonemason in\nHUGH MILLER: FOSSILS, LANDSCAPE AND LITERARY GEOLOGY 89\nthis area in the 1820s). With the publication of The Old\nRed Sandstone in 1841, Miller became a literary geo-\nlogical celebrity, and other collectors and geological\nliterati made contact. His collection of fossils grew\nwith the fruits of his summer or autumn vacation\ntravels of a month or more, such as when he visited his\nboyhood friend the Rev. John Swanson on the \u2018Free\nChurch Yacht Betsey\u2019 in the Inner Hebrides. Over the\nyears, Miller cumulatively traversed Scotland from\nAberdeen to Mull, and from Girvan to the Orkneys,\nand he notably collected on Eigg in 1844 and 1845\n(Miller, 1858b; Hudson, 2003; Taylor, 2003). These\ntravels were to have fuelled a major work on Scottish\ngeology but this was never completed (Miller, 1858b,\n1859). He also travelled into England to extend his\nknowledge, particularly of the older rocks, including a\nweek at the newly classic Silurian locality of Wren\u2019s\nNest at Dudley (Miller, 1847).\nMiller\u2019s collection, as it is today preserved in the\nNational Museums of Scotland, is striking in the way\nin which it reflects the truth of his writing. Miller was\nplainly not driven by the simple aesthetics that led\nsome contemporaries to seek only perfect specimens.\nHe collected in bulk and took specimens which other\ncollectors would have rejected (Fig. 3; L. I. Anderson,\npers. comm., 2002). This was almost inevitable given\nthe nature of the deposits open to him, most fossils\nbeing incomplete and distorted (Janvier, 2003; Trewin,\n2003). But far from rejecting them, he used them as\ncomplementary fragments \u2013 jigsaw pieces \u2013 to recreate\na mental picture of the original animal, \u2018every new\nspecimen that turned up furnishing a key for some part\npreviously unknown \u2013 until at length, after many an\nabortive e\ufb00ort, the creatures rose up before me in their\nstrange, unwonted proportions\u2019 (Fig. 4). Like others at\nthe cutting edge of science, he found that he had no\nlanguage with which to begin to understand these\nfinds. So he simply distinguished his fossils with num-\nbers for species (Miller, 1858a, pp. 527\u2013528).\nMiller\u2019s eye was su\ufb03ciently acute to appreciate both\nextremes of scale, from the grand landscape (Hudson,\n2003) to the minute detail of fossils (Janvier, 2003;\nMorrison-Low & Nuttall, 2003) and to make them\nwork together. He recognized the need to train the eye\nand to construct a mental reference library of forms, a\ngeological vocabulary of species. This analogy can be\nextended to the way in which Miller sought to work\nout the various ways in which fossils of the same\nspecies could be preserved, much as the same basic\nword can be inflected or parsed in many ways. Indeed,\nMiller\u2019s trip to Dudley was for this very purpose\n(Miller, 1847, p. 84).\nAs with other collectors, Miller\u2019s connoisseurship\nrelied on the development of general taxonomic and\nstratigraphic notions of \u2018types\u2019 and \u2018series\u2019 to catego-\nrize observations and discriminate species and strata.\nMiller\u2019s respect for detail and for the value of even\nfragmentary fossils is also seen in the new breed of\nresearch-driven professional palaeontologist then\nemerging (Knell, 2000).\nFig. 3.

THE CROMARTY STONEMASON AS FOSSIL\nCOLLECTOR\nOne might well imagine that being a time-served\nstonemason had advantages for Miller the collector.\nHe could hew open a nodule with ease, using the tools,\nskills and physique from a life of hard labour amidst\nrocks (Miller, 1858b, p. 241). But the best fossil\ncollector need not be much of a geologist or much of a\nmason. Miller did not, as far as we know, and contrary\nto what is sometimes said, actually find fossils in the\nBlack Isle quarries where he worked. More important\nwas his presence on the same spot for a long time,\nenabling him to be opportunistic \u2013 for instance if a\nspring tide revealed a new exposure on a beach (Tay-\nlor, 2000). Like other collectors, Miller had to acquire\nan eye for the local strata and the signs that signal its\nfossils. Indeed, Miller illustrates the importance of\ndeveloping what zoologists today call a \u2018search image\u2019,\nthe ability to spot the very specific Gestalt of the fossils\nof a particular locality. His early collecting in the\nsupposedly \u2018Liassic\u2019 rocks of Navity and Eathie gave\nhim a particular eye for their fossiliferous nodules.\nWhen he came to draw up a model of local geology, he\ninferred the possible presence of the \u2018Lias\u2019 on the other\nside of the \u2018granitic gneiss\u2019 of the South Sutor head-\nland, at Cromarty itself, and accordingly investigated\nthe beach there. This research programme (as we might\ntoday describe it) led to his discovery of a stratum\nbearing nodules, which he promptly cracked open \u2013 no\ndoubt prompted by his learning at Eathie to equate\nnodules with fossils (Miller, 1841, pp. 115\u2013117; L. I.\nAnderson, pers. comm., 2002). This serendipitous mis-\napplication of his \u2018search image\u2019 thus led him to the\nentirely di\ufb00erent fossils of what became his classic\nbeach site of The Old Red Sandstone fame, and the\ndiversion of his \u2018research programme\u2019 towards the\nexploitation of this site and the search for more\noutcrops of fish-bearing Old Red in the area (Fig. 5;\nMiller, 1841, pp. 118\u2013122; Oldroyd, 1996). However,\nFig. 4. Miller often tried to reconstruct the living animal from fragmentary specimens. This example of Coccosteus cuspidatus\nMiller 1841 ex Agassiz MS still shows the painted letters he used to label the individual elements (not to be confused with the\nnumbers he initially used to distinguish species: see text).

Sunday\nwas his one clear day o\ufb00 in the working week, but he\nwould have avoided collecting fossils on that day,\ncertainly after his religious commitment of the mid-\n1820s, and probably before. Collecting was not a work\nof necessity or mercy, the only labour permitted on the\nPresbyterian Sabbath, and indeed Miller disapproved\nof even the temperate and self-improving country\npursuits of the English Sunday (Miller, 1847, p. 42). As\na stonemason, he at least had the winter months free\nfor geological work, although they would have been\nlimited by daylight and tide. Later, as a bank clerk, he\nfound his travels restricted by his duties: \u2018I found\nmyself somewhat in the circumstances of a tolerably\nlively beetle stuck on a pin, that, though able, with a\nlittle exertion, to spin round its centre, is yet wholly\nunable to quit it\u2019 (Miller, 1858a, p. 530). During this\nperiod, he could only go collecting on Saturday after-\nnoons and during long summer evenings, when some-\ntimes he and his wife Lydia would sail along the coast\nin their little boat to various localities, doubtless with a\npicnic, and often returning with freshly caught fish for\nsupper (Miller, 1858a, pp. 532\u2013533; Sutherland, 2002,\npp. 49, 170). It was only from 1840, at The Witness,\nthat he seems to have found time for longer trips,\npartly for health reasons and partly to visit his Cro-\nmarty relatives.\n6. GEOLOGY BECOMES MORE THAN A\nCOLLECTION\nDuring the early nineteenth century, careers in geology\n\u2013 if often precarious ones \u2013 were emerging in the more\npopulous parts of Britain; but Miller had no such\nopportunities. From the start, geology was his recrea-\ntion. His ambitions, his career hopes, were centred on\nliterature. David Alston has kindly pointed out to us\nthat Miller\u2019s general reputation as the local literary\nlion, the \u2018Cromarty Stonemason\u2019, prior to his depar-\nture from Cromarty, stemmed from his literary work,\nowing little if anything to geology (this is, of course,\nquite separate from his increasing reputation within\nthe specialist geological community from the late 1830s\nonwards).\nMiller published no geological books until after his\nliterary e\ufb00orts had obtained him the editorship of The\nWitness at the start of 1840, apart from a brief\ndiscussion, mixed with topography and local history,\nin just two chapters of the first edition of Scenes and\nLegends in 1835. However, we cannot ascribe Miller\u2019s\nestablishment as a geological writer solely to his be-\ncoming a newspaper editor. He had plainly already\nrealized that his recreation could provide useful ma-\nterial for his journalistic repertoire: in 1838, he pub-\nlished a double article, \u2018Gropings of a Geologist\u2019, in\nChambers\u2019s Edinburgh Journal (Miller, 1838). More-\nover, he told his friend Patrick Du\ufb00 of his intentions to\ndraw up an account of the geology of Cromarty over\nthe summer of 1839 (Miller to Patrick Du\ufb00, 15 Decem-\nber 1838, Elgin Museum Geology Letter G1\/2); so it is\npossible that much of The Old Red Sandstone was, in\nfact, written before he left his home town. Neverthe-\nless, up to 1840, Miller would have been regarded as no\nmore than a minor collector in the culture of geology\nat that time.\nMiller\u2019s editorial post gave him new opportunities\nfor free time for fieldwork and for literary development\n(as the editor, he decided what went into the newspa-\nper). The success of The Old Red Sandstone (1841, but\nserialized in The Witness in 1840) transformed matters.\nTo his literary persona as historian and chronicler he\nadded a new geological theme which cast him as\nhaving been a gifted \u2018Robinson Crusoe\u2019 of geology,\nand now an expert in fossil fish and in the interpret-\nation of the deep past. His mix of geology with moral\nand social comment became his trademark. It intro-\nduced a new form of popular geological writing which,\nthough rigorous, was often one or two steps removed\nfrom the technicalities then entering the standard\npopular works of Charles Lyell or Gideon Mantell\n(e. g. Lyell, 1830\u20131833; Mantell, 1844).\n7. MILLER AND THE POSSESSION OF\nNATURE\nMiller evidently took his collection seriously enough to\nbuild a \u2018museum\u2019 in the back garden of his house,\nShrub Mount, in Portobello, Edinburgh, and he was\ngrateful enough to accept Lord Kinnaird\u2019s gift of a\nmantrap (apparently of the \u2018humane\u2019 kind which\nlacked teeth) to protect it, even if his biographer,\nrather unreasonably, regarded this as an early symp-\ntom of the mental pressure which led Miller to suicide\n(Bayne, 1871, 2, p. 463). But what value was Miller\nprotecting? Clearly the collection embodied a vast\namount of hard work and time. Some might say that it\nalso embodied an important part of his reputation. Yet\nthere was certainly much more to it than a research\nresource, for it plainly had emotional value. Miller\u2019s\nwritings are su\ufb00used with the thrill of discovery and\nthe wonder and beauty of fossils, as well as rueful\ncomments on the obsessive qualities of collecting (Fig.\n6; e.g. Miller, 1858a, p. 160; 1858b, p. 433). Miller\nrecognized that he had the morally beneficial attributes\nof the collector but he also appreciated that collecting\nhad an emotive grip upon him.\nObsession, however, is nevertheless an unsatisfac-\ntory explanation in itself. Collectors of even the most\nmundane things are inevitably also making themselves,\nand constructing some aspect of their identities,\nwhether intentionally or not. Perhaps there was a\nreligious motive and, indeed, Miller has a reputation\nfor invoking his Presbyterian God, although in fact\nsuch invocations are not actually that prominent in\nmuch of his writing. The obvious question is whether\nS. J. KNELL & M. A. TAYLOR92\nhis collecting was motivated by a religious drive to\nreveal the Divine plan of creation, which impelled so\nmuch e\ufb00ort at the time, and on which Miller wrote so\neloquently, certainly in later life. However, Miller\nbegan collecting fossils at a time when he was wavering\nbetween religion and scepticism, a few years before he\na\ufb03rmed his adult commitment to Evangelical Presby-\nterianism around 1825 (Miller, 1858a, pp. 373\u2013378).\nRather, it seems likely that Miller was collecting pri-\nmarily for his own personal satisfaction, for the pleas-\nure of fresh air, discovery and intellectual and\nemotional achievement. The religious benefits, real as\nthey became, were a later bonus.\nElsewhere in Britain, how people collected fossils,\nand took part in scientific activity, revealed core beliefs\nabout the ownership of fossils, about the rights which\nthis ownership was seen to confer, and about the\ncontrol of the associated ideas (Knell, 2000). Miller\u2019s\nvigorous opposition to the Game Laws revealed his\nbelief that the rights of private property should not be\nunreasonably absolute, particularly with regard to\nownership of land. He believed that people had a right\nof access to the countryside and to the fruits of Nature\nwherever they might be found (Miller, 1862, pp. 243\u2013\n264; Taylor, 2003). When warned o\ufb00 geologizing on\nEigg, Miller amused himself with the idea of a \u2018fossil\npreserve\u2019, linked with a \u2018great fossil act for the British\nempire, framed on the principles of the game-laws\u2019.\nNevertheless, he hit home with his pickaxe and ex-\ntracted some fossil wood, \u2018feloniously, I dare say,\nthough the crime has not yet got into the statute-book\u2019,\njokingly hoping that the gentlemen of the Geological\nSociety would rescue him should the case ever come to\nlaw (Miller, 1858b, p. 36).\nAt that time geology was especially dependent on\nthe information being generated by the study of fossils,\nwhich was in turn driven forward by a general belief in\nthe fossil collector\u2019s rights of ownership. Few people,\nafter all, would collect fossils if they could not keep\nthem. This was even truer of new fossils, of \u2018discover-\nies\u2019. In Britain the social advantages of discovery in\ngeology were well recognized. Like his contemporaries,\nMiller would fiercely protect his discoveries, though he\nat least sometimes justified this by emphasizing the\nwork put into a fossil\u2019s study and reconstruction,\npossibly revealing the strength of his underlying Cal-\nvinism. His most notable defence came in a fierce\npriority dispute waged in public with a Mr Keir over\nthe Old Red fish Pterichthys milleri (Andrews, 1982, p.\n27). Miller, indeed, exemplified how one can \u2018own\u2019\nboth the physical fossil and the concepts abstracted\nfrom it when, in 1838, he joked with Patrick Du\ufb00\nabout a possible crest carrying the image of Coccosteus\nand the motto \u2018Miller\u2019s own reptile\u2019, which was syn-\nonymous with \u2018The beast that Miller found\u2019 (Miller to\nPatrick Du\ufb00, 15 December 1838, Elgin Museum Ge-\nology Letter G1\/2). Here, he was plainly aware of the\nsignificance of possessing an invention of one\u2019s own,\nwhether in the sense of recognizing a new fossil animal,\nor that of the wider intellectual creation involved in its\nstudy and reconstruction.\n8. MILLER\u2019S FOSSILS AS HISTORY AND\nLANDSCAPE\nWe know little about the various possible collections to\nwhich Miller was exposed as a child (Miller, 1858a,\nFig. 6. Miller appreciated the beauty of fossils, such as the still glossy enamel on the scales of this fish. Osteolepis\nmacrolepidotus Agassiz 1835, Old Red Sandstone, Cromarty, Hugh Miller collection, NMS.G.1859.33.1218. Photograph by\nNMS Photography Section, copyright The Trustees of the National Museums of Scotland.\nHUGH MILLER: FOSSILS, LANDSCAPE AND LITERARY GEOLOGY 93\n1995). It is clear that books, then relatively scarce and\nprecious, often appeared to him in the form of distinct\ncollections to be discovered in the houses of relatives\nand neighbours. Their unwritten equivalents, the oral\ntales of the neighbourhood, were another kind of\ncollection about which he tells us a great deal. He was\nclearly collecting stories and drawing upon them as a\nresource for his writing, as Miller\u2019s outstanding critic\nMackenzie notes: \u2018gathering and pondering over the\nfossils of the mind even before those of the buried ages\nof the earth\u2019 (Mackenzie, 1905, p. 60).\nMiller compared the Eathie fossils to an Alexan-\ndrian library (Miller 1858a, p. 163). If made, perhaps,\nwith hindsight, it is still not a superficial simile, for the\nfossils provided a comparable resource for writing.\nLike books and oral traditions, the fossils provided a\nmeans to extend the imagined past back through time.\nThey sat within a seamless historical continuum, which\nincluded also topography, legend, folk memory, sur-\nviving rural practices and the histories in books.\nAs Paradis (1996) shows, Miller\u2019s historical writing\nmythologized the past, drawing directly from tradi-\ntional storytelling, with its controlled emphases and\ndramatic e\ufb00ects, its poetics and aesthetics. It also came\nto draw upon the theatre (O\u2019Connor, 2003a, b). The\nautobiographical aspect of Miller\u2019s writings (Vincent,\n1996) cast him as part of the myth, drawing not so\nmuch upon the hard reality of a life lived but rather\nupon the poetic reality of the great communicator in\nan equally poetic landscape (Mackenzie, 1905, p. 15).\nMiller was consistently true to his boyhood nickname\nof \u2018Sennachie\u2019, which originally meant \u2013 in Gaelic\nculture \u2013 a professional recorder and reciter of family\nhistory, but also has the more general meaning, which\nprobably applies here, of a teller of traditional tales.\nMackenzie deployed another traditional if, perhaps,\nmore Lowlander term, makar \u2013 the archaic Scots for\npoet \u2013 when he called Miller \u2018a \u201cmakar\u201d in geology; a\nreconstructor in his own melodious and strikingly\nsuggestive language of ideal geologic landscapes\u2019\n(Mackenzie, 1905, pp. 121\u2013122).\nMiller frequently referred to one of his idols, the\npoet William Cowper, in First Impressions of England.\nA visit to Cowper\u2019s home town of Olney led Miller to\nquote him (Miller, 1847, p. 260):\nNow roves the eye;\nAnd, posted on this speculative height,\nExults in its command. The sheepfold here\nPours out its fleecy tenants o\u2019er the glebe.\nAt first, progressive as a stream, they seek\nThe middle field; but, scattered by degrees,\nEach to his choice, soon whiten all the land .\nThe poet\u2019s eye had perceived what others do not see:\nimagination is replaced by perceptiveness rooted in the\nobservation of reality that was so important to Miller\u2019s\nworld view (and, indeed, Miller wrote little fiction).\nMiller never really achieved that level of concision and\nhe had to make a rather more substantial e\ufb00ort to get\nhis sheep out of the fold, or, at least in this case, extract\nhis saurian from the footprints and other traces on a\nstone slab in Warwick Museum (Miller, 1847, p. 191;\nchelonians comprise turtles, terrapins and tortoises):\nThe chelonian journeyed adown a moist sandy\nslope, furrowed by ripple-markings, apparently to\na watering\u2013place. He travelled leisurely, as be-\ncame a reptile of consequence, set down his full\nweight each step he took, and left a deep-marked\ntrack in double line behind him. And yet, were his\nnerves less strong, he might have bestirred himself;\nfor the southern heavens were dark with tempest\nat the time, and a thunderous-like shower, scarce\na mile away, threatened to wet him to the skin. On\nit came; and the large round drops, driven aslant\nby a gale from the south, struck into the sand like\nsmall shot, at an angle of sixty. How the traveller\nfared on the occasion has not transpired; but clear\nand palpable it is that he must have been a firm\nfellow, and that the heavy globular drops made a\nmuch less marked impression on the sand consoli-\ndated by his tread than when they fell elsewhere\non the incoherent surface around him.\nBut the observation and precision are there, also.\nMiller is here deploying a linguistic invention that\nresembles Cowper\u2019s. It succeeds because it draws upon\nthe observed world and upon things which we could\nsee and yet fail to see \u2013 at least until the author delivers\nthe narrative which, though evocative, becomes all the\nmore sublime for being rooted in reality.\nA key to this interpretation of the object is the\npresence of Miller himself, juxtaposed with the fossil\nworld which he is interpreting. Sometimes he seems to\nbe Virgil, perhaps escorting the reader\u2019s Dante through\nan imagined Palaeozoic Inferno or Paradise. At other\ntimes he is more like the visitor\u2019s guide then still\ncommon in museums. Miller\u2019s explicit guidance, and\nhis return sooner or later to the specimen or site where\nhe himself is situated as observer, help the reader travel\nthrough time from deep past to present, and relate the\ntwo (Fig. 7). Whether he is making social comment or\nshowing us a fossil specimen, Miller\u2019s presence is not\nmerely autobiographical: it has powerful heuristic and\nliterary functions, like the presence of each specimen\nitself as a piece of reality, simultaneously both of the\npast and the present.\nAs Miller moved from dealing with observations on\nlife and the past, which used fossils as real-world\nreference points and libraries of evidence, to wider\nissues of the place of God in creation and the truths of\ngeology, his fossils took on new roles as reifications:\nthings which made concrete the truth of his beliefs. In\nFootprints of the Creator (1849), Miller attempted to\nkill o\ufb00 the reheated Lamarckian evolutionism of\nRobert Chambers\u2019s Vestiges of the Natural History of\nCreation (1844). It is striking how he used his speci-\nmens like chessmen, or the specialist troops of\nan army: recognizably individual specimens were\nS. J. KNELL & M. A. TAYLOR94\ndeployed in sequence, thumped down on the table as\nhis assault proceeded. For instance, Miller\u2019s initial\nbreakthrough was made with his narrative of the\nfinding of a particular example of the fossil fish\n\u2018Asterolepis\u2019, precisely located at a specific time and\nplace in the Orcadian landscape near Stromness\n(Miller, 1864, pp. 5\u20138, and cf. Miller, 1858b; Taylor,\n2003).\nIn Footprints and in Testimony of the Rocks Miller\nclearly trod a borderline between the Biblical literalists\nand those geologists and materialists who saw no role\nfor God. Here, again, Miller found his own way,\nmarrying evidence with belief. He was not engaged in\ncompromise but in searching for a solution to the\npuzzle which accommodated two sets of unquestion-\nable truths (Miller, 1857, p. 265; Macleod, 1996, 2002;\nO\u2019Connor, 2003a). As he put it, \u2018Between the Word\nand the Works of God there can be no actual discrep-\nancies .\u2019 and again\n[given that] the Scriptures could not possibly have\nbeen given to us as revelations of scientific truth,\nseeing that a single scientific truth they never yet\nrevealed, and . it must be in vain to seek in\nscience those truths which lead to salvation, seeing\nthat in science these truths were never yet found,\nthere would be little danger even of di\ufb00erence\namong them, and none of collision.\nThis is not a man torn between science and religion,\nbut, on the contrary, one who is comfortable with\nboth. There is little if any evidence that Miller\u2019s\ncontemporaries found him far out of line. Many con-\ntemporary geologists were in the same position of\naccommodating their Christianity with their geology,\nwhile, for its own part, the Free Church, at least, felt\nthe need to provide geological courses at its College for\ntrainee ministers (Andrews, 1982).\n9. MILLER\u2019S FOSSILS AND THEIR\nIMPORTANCE\nAfter his early death, Miller\u2019s widow received two\no\ufb00ers for his collection: one of \u00a31000 from \u2018a Scottish\nNobleman\u2019 and another of 1000 guineas [\u00a31050] from\nan American college. The British government was\nwilling to put up \u00a3500 and a committee under the\ndirection of the Lord Provost of Edinburgh success-\nfully organized a subscription to meet the shortfall,\nsaving the collection \u2018for Scotland\u2019, as the Proposal to\npurchase the museum of the late Hugh Miller put it\n(Anon., [1858]; Taylor & Gostwick, 2003). The precur-\nsor of what is now the National Museums of Scotland\nformally took possession of the collection in 1859.\nSome other Miller specimens exist elsewhere, including\nthose in Miller House in Cromarty. Miller\u2019s son, Hugh\n(1850\u20131896), became a professional geologist with the\nGeological Survey in nice contrast to his father, and\nthe specimens there presumably stem from the \u2018mu-\nseum\u2019 which he set up in his father\u2019s memory, appar-\nently some time after 1884, during the period when he\nwas mapping his father\u2019s old stamping grounds for the\nGeological Survey (Gunn, 1897; Horne, [1899]).\nThis appraisal has revealed further depths to Hugh\nMiller\u2019s appreciation of geological specimens and to\nthe significance of his surviving collection. Miller\u2019s\nrelationship with the material world of objects showed\nFig. 7. Miller cemented these fossil freshwater shells from the former Boroughloch of Edinburgh onto a card in the form of an\nIonic column capital. Miller reconstructed the past from specimens such as these (Miller, 1862). He took a great interest in what\nwould now be called Quaternary geology, prominent in the neighbourhood of his successive homes of Cromarty and\nEdinburgh.

They give no indication of a man torn\nbetween opposites. His fossils performed, and continue\nto perform, real scientific service. Yet, on top of this,\nMiller gave his fossils the role of reconciling geological\nand religious truths and deployed them in a pragma-\ntism that drew upon both ends of the scale. The fossils\nalso provided a link in the continuum of time. They\ncomprised a vehicle for exploring the deep past without\nlosing continuity with a past of recorded folk legend\nand history, and a present where he was situated as\nobserver, geologist, stonemason and \u2018Sennachie\u2019. The\nfossils also provided evidence of a reality that could be\nexplored scientifically and poetically, without the two\ncoming into conflict. Miller\u2019s fossils sat as subjects for\nhis painterly prose, perhaps in individual portraits, or\nas part of landscapes, or just studied in minute detail \u2013\nthere was no constraint on scale or resolution. Miller\u2019s\nfossils exemplify the deep continuity of his world.\nAttempting to compartmentalize it is like cutting\nquicksilver. Whatever perspective he takes, whatever\nanalytical criterion is used, Miller\u2019s work is unseg-\nmented, often leading us back to consider the impact\nof Cromarty, and of being a Lowlander and a\nCalvinist.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors are very grateful to Lester Borley and the\nCromarty Arts Trust for permission to reprint this,\nwith emendations, updating and the addition of an\nintroductory section and illustrations, from Knell &\nTaylor (2003).
