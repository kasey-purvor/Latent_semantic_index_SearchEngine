Time. Colleagues want more time to research, do not have enough time to read, \nare working too much of their time, cannot fit the job into the time available, cannot spend enough \ntime with students who need them, have to spend too much time with students who do not \nappreciate them, get riled by parents who assume they have long vacation times and so on. The \nlitany is familiar and long. I was prompted to reflect a bit more specifically on what is going here by \na couple of events arising from structural developments in the British university system. Firstly as \npart of \u2018transparency audits\u2019, I had to do my annual time-use survey exercise. This records broad \nheadings of activities so the university can allocate overhead costs on research and teaching. It is a \nsimple post hoc exercise of dubious reliability, but one that tries very hard to talk in proportions of \ntime rather than total amounts. Second then, my university has just managed to implement a \nnational staff regrading structure agreed, after some acrimony, two years ago across all British \nuniversities. All jobs were re-evaluated, from porter to professor, measured against a variety of \nskills and placed on one grand scheme of job categories. This July, one month before the final \ndeadline allowed in the national agreement, my institution managed to send out the notices of our \nnew gradings and related conditions of employment. The portion of the conditions that struck me \nwas the brevity with which it could detail expectations of work for academics. Unlike complex \nformulae and discussions for hourly paid staff, for academics it mandates: \n\u2018a nominal working week of 35 hours per week, [where] the hours and days are not strictly \ndefined as it is expected that employees on these grades will manage their own time to \nensure that all duties and responsibilities are fully completed, where this involves additional \ntime either at work or away from the workplace no enhanced rates of pay will apply.\u2019 \nOn the face of it, this seems not merely a typical statement of being a salaried employee but the sort \nof positive flexible arrangement many employees in other sectors would crave. So why then is there \nall the angst? Part of the answer is in the combination with the definition of the duties and \nresponsibilities that must be \u2018fully completed\u2019. So being in an \u2018old\u2019 university, my contract defines \nas \u2018such teaching, research and administration as the Vice-Chancellor or Chair of Board of Studies \nmay from time to time specify\u2019. So between these two phrases, we have presented the ambiguity \nand flexibility of academic time: an open ended set of tasks and an indeterminate time period. I \nwant to use some reflection of the temporalities of academic work to raise issues that perhaps speak \nto other forms and work and indeed to how we need to think through temporalities. \n \nTime Burdens, Time Measures, Times Tallied up \n \nOne clear reason for angst over time is pressure on academics in terms of the overall demands of the \njob. The last decade or two in British academia have seen a large expansion in student numbers, \ngrowing pressure to conduct and publish research alongside new regulatory and administrative \nregimes designed to render these activities transparent and auditable. The impact of audits is not \nonly in terms of performance anxiety but as a time burden. Taking all these demands together the \noverall time demands on academics in the UK have been growing. The then Association of \nUniversity Teachers (2006) used official statistics to suggest that from a base of a 39 hour week, \nfaculty averaged 9 hours a week \u2018unpaid\u2019 overtime \u2013 or, putting it another way, were working for \nfree for three months of each year. Add to this the evidence from the union sponsored survey of \n2004 on work life balance and stress where 59% of full time employees admitted to working more \nthan 45 hours in a typical week, with 21% typically doing more than 55 hours and only 40% taking \nall their entitlement to annual leave (Kinman and Jones 2004, pages 1, 4). The resulting quantitative \npicture attests to large work loads and pressures on work-life balances.  \n \nOne strategy to attempt to deal with these time pressures is using workload models. So for my \ndepartment every teaching and administrative activity is given a time allocation. Your duties can \n 2\nthus be added up to produce an overall commitment, and line managers should thus be able to \nallocate tasks to enable some approximate parity. In my workplace, the aim is to keep everyone to \nwithin 20% variance from the average load (calculated pro rata for fractional staff, sabbaticals and \nso forth) and to contain total teaching and administration time to allow time for research. In the \neight years it has been running, two trends have become evident. First, the credit for work is always \ncontested. How much time does an \u2018average\u2019 postgraduate take to supervise? How long does it take \nto write a lecture? Statistical norms become normative standards quite quickly. Secondly, more and \nmore has to be included in the model \u2013 to get someone to do a job, it has to count. Currently the \nmodel stops short of including research \u2013 but with new funding rules paying for academic\u2019s time \ninputs to projects, this will surely start to be factored in soon enough. \n \nSuch models offer some protection or at least definition of expectations, but inevitably using time as \na metric means equating apples and pears. The rewards, both personal and professional, from say \nsupervising a postgraduate cannot be easily equated with an equal time taken teaching however \nmany first year lectures, or organising a seminar programme, for instance. They may all take the \nsame amount of time, but their meaning is very different. So there is an issue to unpack not just how \nmuch time, but the value of that time to individuals and institutions? However, I also want to push \nthis a little further to think not only about quantities of time involved but the types of time \u2013 the \ntemporalities. I want to suggest that as much stress results from conflicting temporalities as from \nabsolute demands on academic time. \n \nAcademic Temporalities \n \nYlijoki and Mantila (2003) in a study of Finnish academics identified four senses of time - \nscheduled time, contracted time, timeless time and personal time. Scheduled time referred to the \ndemanded and organised time laid out by institutions \u2013 this is where the pace, duration and timing \n 3\nof an activity is defined by the organisation. Typically academics have watched this increase as \nuniversities have become more active in managing their staff and leave less autonomy over \nactivities. Contracted time refers to fixed term projects and fixed term employment \u2013 a sense of \nfinitude and a race to accomplish things before the end point. Again the rise of \u2018flexible\u2019 staffing \nand short term contracts has been marked across higher education. Timeless time is the much \nsought after sense of being lost in one\u2019s work \u2013 reading or researching without a definite series of \noutcomes, but enabling reflection and deeper thought than instrumentally searching for a source to \ncomplete a section of a paper, an example for a lecture or some such. Personal time was the \nperspective reflecting on the overall pattern of their work in terms of a career or work life balances. \nIn Finland too, they found long hours marking sacrifices for career advancement, with 10 or 12 \nhours days and respondents worrying about \u2018burning out\u2019 (Ylijoki and Mantyla 2003, pages 67-8). \nMy suggestion is that the conflicts between these temporal perspectives have been growing. \n \nClearly I do not mean to play down the impact of overall hours. It has become a commonplace to \nironically note academics working long hours to write papers decrying exploitations through long \nhours cultures (I think my first encounter with the example was in Massey, Quintas et al. 1992). \nIndeed personally I am so sad as to be able to talk of writing presentations on the topic of work life \nbalance in the small hours of the morning. And if that is when you are happiest writing in some \nsenses that is part of the flexibility that many others would dearly love to have. But it is not simply \na matter of preference. In their study of women in Canadian academia, Acker and Armenti (2004, \npage 4) sum things up with the poignant informant quote - \u2018I mean, if I didn't have to sleep it would \nbe fine\u2019. Their work points to the systemic imbalances in demands on people\u2019s time. Looking \nespecially at recent mothers they sum up the major coping strategy, and I use that term advisedly, as \nworking harder and sleeping less. Balancing demands to be a carer and have an academic career \nraises an unequally gendered set of issues. Some of these issues are broad policy issues of childcare \nprovision, parental leave, that vary nationally and are outside academia. Some are compopunded by \n 4\nspecific effects within the academy. So increasing numbers of British academics are turning to \nfractional contracts to balance the overall demands of work with caring tasks. That is \u2018tenured\u2019 \nfaculty taking fractional pay for doing a fraction of a full workload. This highlights thorny issues \nfor the academy \u2013since it has rarely defined what a full time work load might be, it is very hard for \neven sympathetic managers to moderate those to fractional contracts (Birnie, Madge et al. 2005).  \n \nHowever, more than just the total amount of work there is the effect of clashing clocks, rhythms and \nroutines. Thus in North America we might see the clashing of the tenure clock with women\u2019s \ndesires to have children, resulting families postponed until tenure is secured \u2013  and with little \nmaternity pay, the timing of births to coincide with the start of summer vacations (Acker and \nArmenti 2004, page 11). Indeed the sense of time as accumulation sits uneasily with the imperatives \nto start afresh and shift focus with shifting jobs, or career breaks or shifts in focus.  We might \ncontrast the more general sense of linear temporality many demand or expect from a career and \nmore episodic and cyclical senses of time in academia. Academic resum\u00e9s are a shrine to the notion \nof linear development \u2013 publication after publication, paper presentation after presentation. That \nvitae are so obsessed with stressing a linear trajectory may indicate this is not the way time in the \nacademy is usually experienced. A case can be made that cyclical time is far more pervasive. In \nBritain, without tenure track clocks, the system of performance audit currently extends all the way \nthrough the career, with work being assessed in Research Assessment Exercise cycles. What you \ndid last time does not matter, the clock is set back to zero and the only question is what have you \ndone in this cycle? Likewise teaching is one of the great cyclical time markers. Each year a new \ncohort starts, the courses have to be revised, retooled and re-presented. These are familiar patterns \nat differing temporal scales \u2013 on a weekly scale the course ticks along, on an annual one it is \nmarching in place. Against this the sense of a career as some sort of arc, or trajectory of smooth \nprogress seems oddly incongruous. Not only does this smooth progress repress cycles it also \ndownplays the sense of episodic time. It is a retrospective fiction, woven by removing the \n 5\ncontingencies and anxious waiting times. So in 2005 the average success rate for getting an \nEconomic and Social Research Council grant was a little over 20% with a six month decision period \n- and other funds and other countries have similar rates. So 80% of the time put into the applications \nis \u2018wasted\u2019 and whole future planned programmes of work never happen. Time spent on these \nthings tends to be edited out of the picture. But these gaps and pauses, the contingency of which of \nour ideas comes off, either through funding or making it through journal refereeing , the lumpiness \nof how sometimes things all seem to go well and sometimes nothing seems to work, tend to be \nsuppressed in the \u2018ideal\u2019 trajectory. The episodic nature of trying to accomplish things, some of \nwhich come off (at first, second or successive attempts), some of which do not (at first, second or \nany attempt), all of which operate on different multiple time scales and rhythms seems central to the \nexperience of being an academic. \n \nFixed or flexible times and places \n \nThe very variability and multiplicity of timescales is at the essence of juggling tasks. Grants to \nreferee or proofs that appear without warning and demand (sometimes vainly) dropping everything; \nuniversity missives demanding information, reports or data similarly appear and usually require \nurgent attention; these have fixed, sometimes short deadlines. Writing a paper, a book or so forth \nmay be a longer process and may have a less fixed end point. The number of clashes is rendered \nharder to manage since there are many commitments from different sources \u2013 from the employing \ninstitution at different levels, from journals, from publishers, from funders, from respondents, from \ncollaborators and so forth. All of whom run to their own timetables. The balance of doing what is \nimportant and not just what is urgent is never easy. Academia often functions on the basis of people \nagreeing to do things far in advance when their diaries look less cluttered and alluring blank spots \nappear on the pages \u2013only to realise once the time arrives it is now just as massively congested as \nany other time. Most often this is experienced as fixed commitments, often of our own choosing, \n 6\ngetting in the way of planned and desired work. For many or most academics getting through the \nfixed commitments gets you to the start of the \u2018real\u2019 work \u2013 that which is going to be found more \nsatisfying or intellectually engaging. I do not wish to imply that fixed commitments may not be \nimportant, discharged professionally and indeed be engaging and rewarding, yet they are often felt \nand spoken of as obstacles.  \n \nEmployers\u2019 work life balance policies often offer flexibility as \u2018the solution\u2019. Academia, of all \nprofessions, has massive flexibility. Many use this, by starting early, or working late, or stopping \nwork and restarting tasks at home to juggle the demands upon them. But this very ability is also one \nof the problems. Since we can reschedule so much, partly since there are so many different things \ngoing on, there is the presumption that academic time is almost infinitely malleable. Coupled with \nthis malleability is a sense of the job being almost infinitely extensible \u2013 with always another item \nthere on the \u2018to do\u2019 or \u2018to read\u2019 pile. That it is our more flexible more ongoing tasks that tend to be \nrescheduled out of normal hours seems apparent when 80% of academics work 20% of their time \noutside normal hours, during which they do half of all personal scholarship (Kinman and Jones \n2004, pages 12, 19). Likewise the times to network, to put it instrumentally, or to offer professional \ncourtesy and hospitality, to be more benign, tend to be out of normal hours and clash with demands \nof being a carer or indeed a partner (Raddon 2002). So one of the defences emerging is reinforcing \nthe \u2018normal working day\u2019 where people, especially on fractional but also full contracts, attempt to \nrestrict work hours as a way of defining the job. If it does not fit then it is asking too much. So may \nbe more staff will see \u2018working at home\u2019 not as the flexible solution to juggling home\/work \ncommitments but as a Trojan horse \u2013 letting the demands of academia in to private time. \n \nPutting boundaries on work is thus often more than a time strategy \u2013 it can be a spatial strategy as \nwell. The ability to work from home has long been a treasured part of academia \u2013 reducing the \npressures of daily commuting, enabling different domestic arrangements. But some of these spatial \n 7\nstrategies now too seem to be shifting. One reason for working at home, which would be familiar to \nVirginia Woolf, was peace and room to think. It was not just that our scholarship got done outside \noffice hours \u2013 it was done outside the office in an environment more conducive to serious \nreflection, with fewer disturbances and competing claims for attention. Except access to a personal \nstudy space, free from other household members\u2019 demands makes assumptions about the overall \nresources available to afford that room and about power within the household to define such room \nas a work space. Moreover, the rise of new media and ways of working are changing the \u2018isolation\u2019 \nof home - as virtual networks and email mean there is less escape from the other demands of work. \n \nThe spatial scale of a globalised academia also poses time-space constraints. Traditional academic \nassumptions of trailing spouses, or relocations for sabbaticals also tend to assume household \nlocational decisions fitting the contours of academia. Dual income households, which are \nincreasingly prevalent, often utilise complex logistical coping strategies that may well mean they \nare more dependent on locally embedded support networks and relationships, and thus less \nlocationally mobile (Jarvis 1999). An assumption of mobility, especially early in the career, bumps \never more frequently into issues of non-work commitments be they as a carer or to partner\u2019s career. \nCompounding this then is that choices for spatial immobility often entail taking less desirable, \npossibly rolling short term, contracts or working in institutions less well suited to individuals\u2019 \nneeds. Certainly there are strong contrasts with economic sectors that have regional or urban labour \nmarkets. Even in a small country like Britain, outside the far south east, the pattern tends to be that \nacademic job moves entail residential moves. The alternative to relocating may be coping strategies \nthat use time flexibility ruthlessly \u2013 working extreme hours for half a week, which imposes its own \nburdens - or employing more remote access for parts of the work period. On a shorter time scale, \ncareers entail not just hours in the office but travel away from home to present, travel to research, \nand, for geographers, travel to take field classes \u2013 all of which have time impacts on spouses and \n 8\npartners. The fixed times, and places, of childcare, schooling, school terms and the like jar uneasily \nwith demands for mobility and time away from home.  \n \nReflections \n \nSome of these issues may be inflected by national structures \u2013 such as audit cultures or maternity \nrights - but these issues are not unique to British academia. Academics remain extremely well \npositioned to fashion their own solutions to issues, although it is clear managements are looking all \ntoo eagerly at ways of monitoring activities. My suspicion is that if such monitoring develops it \nmay well prove terribly counterproductive for institutional managers. Not only might it flag up the \nissue of overall work loads but may well force people to realise what proportion of time is spent \ndoing different sorts of tasks. It might show the costs of all those unsuccessful activities \u2013 may be \neven encouraging fewer but better honed pieces of work. If a triage approach ensued it would surely \nmean further damage to a variety of \u2018professional service\u2019 activities that are collectively vital but \nindividually optional. The hierarchies of fixed versus flexible tasks, urgent versus important would \ncome under intense strain. More seriously it might lead to \u2018bite size\u2019 work \u2013 a productivist ethos \nthat seeks an outcome for each action. Now I am not arguing that publicly funded scholars should \nnot be productive, or even efficient, but the worry surely is that to itemise and justify time may lead \nto a prioritising of more short timescale tasks \u2013 that scheduled time will overwrite timeless time to \nuse Ylojki and Mantyla\u2019s terms. Doreen Massey\u2019s (2002) plea for a sense of time to reflect seems \napposite here. Like her, I am not saying that large works somehow require a monastic retreat and \nsolitary introspection. They do indeed comprise much thinking through action and hosts of \npractices, which could be elaborated, documented and audited. Maybe such an accounting would \nagain reveal the amount of labour that goes into academia. It might also force us into some \nuncomfortable assessments of which activities consume how much time. That may be beneficial. \nBut I very much doubt that increasingly corporate universities will weigh the benefits and costs in \n 9\n 10\nthe same terms. Currently developing a more comprehensive sense of \u2018scheduled time\u2019 may offer us \na way of managing and controlling  \u2018personal time\u2019, but strategically we need to develop ways of \nnarrating different time-scales, rhythms and temporalities that offer a vocabulary for slowness, for \nreflection, and for non-linear paths. \n \nReferences: \n \n \nAcker, S. and C.
