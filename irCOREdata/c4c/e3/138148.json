INTRODUCTION \n \nThe role of an effective regulatory regime in promoting economic growth and development \nhas generated considerable interest among researchers and practitioners in recent years (e.g. \nWorld Bank, 2004).  Regulation can take many forms and the form of regulation policy \nadopted in developing countries has shifted over time (Minogue, 2005).  From the 1960s to \nthe 1980s, market failure was used to legitimise direct government involvement in productive \nactivities in developing countries, by promoting industrialisation through import substitution, \ninvesting directly in industry and agriculture, and by extending public ownership of \nenterprises.  However, following the apparent success of market liberalisation programmes in \nsome developed countries, and the evidence of the failure of state-led economic planning in \ndeveloping ones (World Bank, 1995), the role of state regulation was redefined and narrowed \nto that of ensuring an undistorted policy environment in which efficient markets could \noperate.  Deregulation was widely adopted, often as part of structural adjustment \nprogrammes, with the aim of reducing the \u201cregulatory burden\u201d on the market economy.  \n \nPrivatisation and the more general process of economic liberalisation in developing countries \nhave produced their own problems and failures and have resulted in the current focus on the   \nregulatory state (Majone, 1994, 1997).  The regulatory state model implies leaving \nproduction to the private sector where competitive markets work well and using government \nregulation where significant market failure exists (World Bank, 2001: 1). Arguably, however, \nthe performance of the new regulatory state remains under researched, especially in the \ncontext of developing countries with their own peculiar economic and social problems and \ninstitutional characteristics. Building effective regulatory structures in developing countries is \nnot simply an issue of the technical design of the regulatory instruments, it is also concerned \n 5\nwith the quality of supporting regulatory institutions and capacity (World Bank, 2002: 152).  \nMany of the institutions that support markets are publicly provided, and the effectiveness of \nthese regulatory institutions will be an important determinant of how well markets function.  \nThe quality of regulatory governance will affect regulatory outcomes, which in turn can be \nexpected to impact on economic growth. \n \nThis paper explores the role of regulation in economic growth using an econometric model.  \nMore precisely, it assesses through econometric modelling the impact of variations in the \nquality of regulation on economic performance.  Although earlier studies have looked at \ngovernance as a cause of cross-country productivity or income differences (Olson, et al., \n1998; Kauffman and Kraay, 2002), this paper differs in concentrating on regulation rather \nthan wider governance issues. The results confirm that \u201cgood\u201d regulation is associated with \nhigher economic growth. \n \nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows.  Section 2 reviews issues in the literature \npertinent to the debate on the role of regulation in economic growth, before turning to \nregulatory measures and proxies for the quality of regulation.  In section 3 the models used \nare presented.  Section 4 deals with a descriptive analysis of the data and reports the \nregression results. The results confirm that the quality of state regulation impacts positively \non economic growth.  Finally, section 5 provides conclusions and the implications for \ndevelopment policy. \n \n \n 6\n2. LITERATURE REVIEW \n(a) Regulation Theory \n \nThe theory of economic regulation developed from the nineteenth century and the literature is \nnow vast (for recent reviews, see Laffont and Tirole, 1993, 2000; Levy and Spiller, 1994; \nNewbery, 1999).  The case for economic regulation is premised on the existence of \nsignificant market failure resulting from economies of scale and scope in production, from \ninformation imperfections in market transactions, from the existence of incomplete markets \nand externalities, and from resulting income and wealth distribution effects. It has been \nsuggested that market failures may be more pronounced, and therefore the case for public \nregulation is stronger, in developing countries (Stiglitz 1998). More recent theoretical \ncontributions to the regulation literature have provided a model of regulation for network \nindustries that recognises the particular structural and institutional characteristics of \ndeveloping countries and have highlighted the role of effective regulation in achieving \nequitable and sustainable expansion of infrastructure services in the poorer countries of the \nworld (Laffont, 1999a; 2005).  \n \nHowever, regulation of markets may not result in a welfare improvement as compared to the \neconomic outcome under imperfect market conditions.  In particular, information \nasymmetries can contribute to imperfect regulation.  The regulator and the regulated can be \nexpected to have different levels of information about such matters as costs, revenues and \ndemand.  The regulated agent holds the information that the regulator needs to regulate \noptimally and the regulator must establish rules and incentive mechanisms to coax this \ninformation from the private sector.  Given that it is highly unlikely that the regulator will \nreceive all of the information required to regulate optimally to maximise social welfare, the \n 7\nresults of regulation, in terms of outputs and prices remain \u201csecond best\u201d to those of a \ncompetitive market, which centres attention on barriers to entry (Djankov et al., 2002).  \nShapiro and Willig (1990) argue that state ownership provides more information to regulators \nthan private ownership, so contracting should be less problematic when the state both owns \nand regulates.  However, state ownership is associated with inadequate incentives to gather \nand use this information to maximise economic welfare (Hayek, 1945).  In other words, there \ntends to be a trade off between state ownership reducing the information asymmetries and \nhence transaction costs of regulation and the relative incentives under state control and \nprivate ownership for agents to maximise economic efficiency (Grossman and Hart, 1986; \nSappington and Stiglitz, 1987; Shapiro and Willig, 1990; Yarrow, 1999).  \n \nWelfare-improving regulation assumes that the regulatory authority\u2019s actions are motivated \nby the public interest.  This has been criticised by public choice theorists who argue that \nindividuals are essentially self-interested in or out of the public arena and it is necessary, \ntherefore, to analyse the regulatory process as the product of relationships between different \ngroups (Buchanan, 1972).  This has been refined in the concept of \u201cregulatory capture\u201d, \nwhich involves the regulatory process becoming biased in favour of particular interests.  In \nthe extreme case, the regulatory capture literature concludes that regulation always leads to \nsocially sub-optimal outcomes because of \u201cinefficient bargaining between interest groups \nover potential utility rents\u201d (Newbery, 1999: 134; also, Laffont, 1999b).  In the Chicago \ntradition of regulatory capture (Stigler, 1971; Peltzman, 1976), regulators are presumed to \nfavour producer interests because of the concentration of regulatory benefits and diffusion of \nregulatory costs, which enhances the power of lobbying groups as rent seekers (Reagan, \n1987). \n \n 8\nRegulation is also subject to \u201cpolitical capture\u201d; indeed, political capture may be a much \ngreater threat than capture by producer groups outside of the political system.  Where \npolitical capture occurs, the regulatory goals are distorted to pursue political ends.  Under \npolitical capture, regulation becomes a tool of self-interest within government or the ruling \nelite (Stiglitz, 1998).  More generally, it is to be expected that both the process and outcomes \nof a regulatory regime will be determined by the specific institutional context of an economy, \nas reflected in its formal and informal rules of economic transacting (North, 1990).  By \nsetting the \u201crules of the game\u201d, institutions impact on economic development (World Bank, \n2002; Rodrik et. al., 2004).  Economic development is seen not simply as a matter of \namassing economic resources in the form of physical and human capital, but as a matter of \n\u201cinstitution building\u201d so as to reduce information imperfections, maximise economic \nincentives and reduce transaction costs.  Included in this institution building are the laws and \npolitical and social rules and conventions that are the basis for successful market production \nand exchange.  In particular, relevant modes of conduct in the context of the regulatory state \nmight include probity in public administration, independence of the courts, low corruption \nand cronyism, and traditions of civic responsibility.  \u201cInstitution building\u201d including building \na \u201cgood\u201d regulatory regime is one of the most difficult problems facing developing countries \nand the transition economies at the present time (Kirkpatrick  and Parker, 2004).   \n \n (b) Regulatory Quality  and Development Outcomes \n \nThe outcome of a regulatory system can be assessed against the yardsticks of effectiveness \nand efficiency.  Effective regulation achieves the social welfare goals set down by the \ngovernment for the regulatory authority. In developing countries, the social welfare \nobjectives of regulation are likely to be not simply concerned with the pursuit of economic \n 9\nefficiency but with wider goals to promote sustainable development and poverty reduction. \nEfficient regulation achieves the social welfare goals at minimum economic costs. The \neconomic costs of regulation can take two broad forms: (1) the costs of directly administering \nthe regulatory system, which are internalised within government and reflected in the budget \nappropriations of the regulatory bodies; and (2) the compliance costs of regulation, which are \nexternal to the regulatory agency and fall on consumers and producers in terms of the \neconomic costs of conforming with the regulations and of avoiding and evading them \n(Guasch and Hahn, 1999). \n \nRegulatory quality can also be assessed in terms of the criteria for good governance.1 Parker \n(1999: 224) argues that a well-functioning regulatory system is one that balances \naccountability, transparency and consistency.  Accountability requires the regulatory agencies \nto be accountable for the consequences of their actions, to operate within their legal powers, \nand to observe the rules of due process when arriving at their decisions (e.g. to ensure that \nproper consultation occurs).  Transparency relates to regulatory decisions being reached in a \nway that is revealed to the interested parties.  The third process which provides regulatory \nlegitimacy is consistency.  Inconsistent regulatory decisions undermine public confidence in a \nregulatory system.  Inconsistency leads to uncertainty for investors, which raises the cost of \ncapital and may seriously damage the willingness to invest.  Since political intervention tends \nto undermine regulatory consistency, and politicians may be prone to alter the regulatory \nrules of the game for short-term political advantage, consistency is a primary argument for \nsome kind of \u201cindependent\u201d regulator. \n \nThis discussion suggests that the capacity of the state to provide strong regulatory institutions \nwill be an important determinant of how well markets perform.  An economy with a \n 10\ndeveloped institutional capacity is more likely to be able to design and implement effective \nregulation, which should contribute to improved economic growth. Weaknesses in \ninstitutional capacity to deliver \u2018good\u2019 regulation may be predicted to affect adversely \neconomic development (World Bank, 2002). \n \nEvidence on the quality of regulation in developing countries is limited though growing. But \nwhere research has occurred, the evidence suggests that the results of state regulation have \nbeen disappointing.  A recent study of 13 Asian countries found that 80% of regulators had \nno access to training and regulatory offices were usually understaffed. The report concludes: \n\u201cAsia\u2019s governments rely too much on under-equipped and unsupported independent \nregulators to carry out tasks that are beyond their capabilities\u201d (Jacobs, 2004: 4). In Latin \nAmerica there is often a lack of political support for independent regulation and a lack of \ncommitment to maintaining regulatory independence (Ugaz, 2003).   In the context of Africa, \nit was found that \u201cregulation is being examined as part of individual sector initiatives, but \nthese efforts are uncoordinated, and implementation is being left to follow privatization \ninstead of being put in place concurrently\u201d (Campbell-White and Bhatia, 1998: 5). A similar \npattern of regulatory weaknesses can be discerned in the evidence for individual countries.  In \nIndia, regulatory structures are associated with acute failures in institution building and with a \nbureaucratic approach that curtails enterprise (Lanyi, 2000).  South Africa\u2019s proliferation of \nregulatory bodies is associated with a lack of clarity about roles and responsibilities and with \nthe adoption of policy-making roles independent of government (Schwella, 2002: 3).  In \nMalawi, the electricity industry regulator remains closely connected to the state electricity \nindustry, compromising any notion of real regulatory independence and encouraging \ncapture.2 In Sri Lanka, the policies governing the regulatory process are judged to have been \nad hoc and based on short-term political interests, with deficiencies apparent at each stage of \n 11\nthe process (Knight-John, 2002).  Experiences in the transitional economies also demonstrate \nmuch variability in the performance of the newly established regulatory institutions (Cave \nand Stern, 1998). In recognition that not all is well, the World Bank (2001: v) has stressed the \nimportance of \u201cimproving regulatory regimes and building institutions and capacity \neffectively to supervise the private sector\u201d. The Asian Development Bank (2000: 18) has also \nemphasised the need for improved regulation. \n \nSeveral papers have identified the causal effects of better governance on higher per capita \nincomes in the long run, using regressions with instrumental variables on a cross-section of \ncountries (Barro, 1997; Hall and Jones, 1999; Kauffman and Kraay, 2002).  The causal chain \nbetween governance and economic outcome has also been examined.  Some studies find that \nthe quality of governance and institutions is important in explaining rates of investment, \nsuggesting that one way in which better governance can improve economic performance is by \nimproving the climate for capital creation (World Bank, 2003; Kirkpatrick, Parker and \nZhang, forthcoming,).  Olson et al. (1998) find that productivity growth is higher in countries \nwith better institutions and quality of governance.  Kauffman and Kraay (2002) reinforce \nthese findings, relating the quality of governance to economic outcomes using a data set \ncovering 175 countries for the period 2000-01.  \n \n \n(c) Measures of Regulatory Governance \n \nThe literature suggests, therefore, that the ability of the state to provide effective regulatory \ninstitutions will be an important determinant of how an economy performs.  The major \nvariable of interest is the quality of regulation.  Other researchers have operationalised the \n 12\nbroader concept of governance using two different groups of variables.  The International \nCountry Risk Guide (ICRG) data set is produced annually and covers three aspects of \ngovernment \u2013 bureaucratic quality, law and order and corruption (Political Risk Services, \n2002).  Each variable is measured on a points scale with higher points denoting better \nperformance with respect to the variable concerned.  The assessment is based on expert \nanalysis from an international network and is subject to peer review.  The ICRG variables \nhave been used as proxies for the quality of governance in research (Neumayer, 2002; Olson \net al., 1998). \n \nThe second set of governance variables comprises a set of six aggregate indicators developed \nby the World Bank and drawn from 194 different measures (Kauffman, Kraay and Mastruzzi \n2005).  These indicators are based on several different sources (including international \norganisations, political and business risk rating agencies, think tanks and non-governmental \nbodies) and a linear unobserved components model is used to aggregate these various sources \ninto one aggregate indicator.3  The indicators are normalised with higher values denoting \nbetter governance.  The six indicators provide a subjective assessment of the following \naspects of a country\u2019s quality of governance: \n \n\u2212 Voice and accountability: respect for political rights and civil liberties, public \nparticipation in the process of electing policy makers, independence of media, \naccountability and transparency of government decisions. \n\u2212 Political instability: political and social tension and unrest, instability of government. \n\u2212 Government effectiveness: perceptions of the quality of public provision, quality of \nbureaucracy, competence of civil servants and their independence from political pressure, \nand the credibility of government decisions. \n 13\n\u2212 Regulatory quality: burden on business via quantitative regulations, price controls and \nother interventions in the economy. \n\u2212 Rule of law: respect for law and order, predictability and effectiveness of the judiciary \nsystem, enforceability of contracts. \n\u2212 Control of corruption: perceptions of the exercise of public power for private gain. \n \nThe focus of this study is on regulation rather than governance. We therefore use the two \nvariables in the World Bank data set that come closest to capturing the quality of the  \noutcome and process dimensions of regulation, namely the regulatory quality and government \neffectiveness indices.   The regulatory quality index measures the regulatory burden on \nbusiness associated with inefficient quantitative controls and can be taken as a proxy for the \nquality of the outcomes of applying regulatory instruments.  The government effectiveness \nindex measures the quality of public provision, competence of civil servants and the \ncredibility of government decisions, and can therefore act as a proxy for the process \ndimensions (consistency, accountability, transparency) of regulatory governance. \n \nThe objective of the empirical analysis reported below, in section 3, is to test for a causal link \nbetween regulation quality and economic performance.  The approach is to adopt a growth \naccounting framework, where economic growth is used as the measure of economic \nperformance and regulation is entered as an input in the production function. \n \nNeoclassical growth modelling began with the work of Solow (1956), who employed a neo-\nclassical production function to explain economic growth in the USA during the first half of \nthe twentieth century.  Important assumptions of this approach are constant returns to scale \nand diminishing returns to investment, which imply that for a given rate of saving and \n 14\npopulation growth economies move towards their steady-state growth path.  This can be \nextended to differences in income levels between countries, to argue that in the long run \nincome per capita levels will converge. A lack of empirical support for convergence and the \npresence of a large, unexplained \u201cresidual\u201d factor in the function estimates have presented a \nmajor challenge to these models. The endogenous growth theory put forward by Romer \n(1986) and Lucas (1988) led to renewed interest in economic growth analysis.  An important \nadvantage of endogenous over traditional growth models is that, through the assumption of \nconstant or increasing returns to a factor input, in particular human capital, it is possible to \nexplain a lack of growth and income convergence between countries and to account more \nfully for the residual factor in Solow-type analyses.  The \u201cgrowth accounting\u201d exercises, \npopularised by Barro and others (Barro, 1991, 2000; Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1992), fall \nwithin the generalised Solow-type growth model.  An important characteristic of this \napproach is the inclusion of various indicators of economic structure.  Most empirical \nresearch using this approach has found evidence of \u201cconditional\u201d convergence, where \nconvergence is conditional on the level or availability of complementary forms of investment, \nincluding human capital and a supportive policy environment. This suggests that the failure \nof developing countries to converge on the income levels of developed countries may be \nattributed, at least in part, to institutional factors.4  The importance of institutional capacity \nfor the design and implementation of  effective economic policy has been demonstrated in \nvarious empirical studies of cross-country growth, for example Sachs and Warner (1995) and \nBarro (2000).  A similar approach is adopted in this study to examine the role of regulatory \ninstitutional capacity in accounting for cross-country variations in economic growth. \n \nAn issue that needed to be addressed at the outset is causality.  It could be argued that instead \nof regulatory quality determining economic growth, regulatory quality could be determined \n 15\nby the economy\u2019s growth rate. Economies that grow faster are able to generate higher levels \nof income and are therefore able to support the development of better institutions.  Or, \nalternatively, there may be a level of simultaneity, in the sense that institutional quality \ngenerates more sustained economic growth, which in turn supports more and better \nregulatory institutions. The Granger causality test is commonly used in empirical work to \nestablish the direction of causation.  However, this test is sensitive to the length of lags of the \nvariables used and therefore requires a relatively long time series dimension to be able to \nselect the right length of lag and to be relatively confident about the conclusion drawn.  Since \nthe time dimension of our regulation data is limited, we are unable to apply the Granger \ncausality test. Fortunately, there is a substantial literature that indicates that better governance \nleads to higher income rather than causation being in the opposite direction (Olson et al 1998; \nAcemoglu et al 2000; Rodrik et al 2004).  Kauffman et al (2005: 38) implement an empirical \nprocedure for testing for causation, which leads to the identification of strong positive causal \neffects running from better governance to higher per capita incomes and suggest that a one \nstandard deviation improvement in governance leads to a two- to three-fold difference in \nincome levels in the long run. The authors state, \u2018Some observers have argued that  \u2026.. there \nis a strong causal impact of income on governance. However, we argue that the existing \nevidence does not support a strong causal channel operating in this direction \u2013 most of the \ncorrelation between governance and per capita income reflects causation from the former to \nthe latter\u2019 (Kauffman et al 2005, p3). They conclude: \u201cavailable evidence suggests that the \ncausal impact of incomes on governance is small. Rather, the observed correlation between \ngovernance and per capita incomes primarily reflects causation in the other direction: better \ngovernance raises per capita incomes\u201d.  However, we accept that because we are unable to \nrigorously demonstrate causation in our modelling, the results should be read with this \ncaveat. \n 16\n \nEndogeneity is another issue that should be addressed. To cope with the possible problem of \nendogeneity, a 2SLS or IV technique can be used.  But to to do this effectively requires good \nsets of instruments for the variables that potentially could suffer from this problem, including \nlags of the variables concerned.  Once again, data availability, particularly relating to the \nregulatory proxies, does not permit an effective test for endogeneity. We accept that this \nremains a weakness. \n \n3. THE MODELLING \n \nThe approach used in the modelling is to assume that each country\u2019s production possibility \nset, in common with most literature in this area, is described by a Cobb-Douglas production \nfunction: \n \nit it it itY A K L\n\u03b1 \u03b2=          (1) \n \nwhere Y is the output level; A, level of productivity; K, stock of capital; and L, stock of \nlabour -  \u2018i\u2019 and \u2018t\u2019 stand for country and time respectively.  Assuming that the production \nfunction exhibits constant return to scale with respect to physical inputs,  (2) can be written in \nper capita terms as: \n  \nitit it\ny A k\u03b1=          (2) \n \nwhere lower case letters refer to per capita units.  Assume a simple Keynesian capital \naccumulation rule according to the following specification: \n 17\n \n\/ ( )dk dt sy n k\u03b4= \u2212 +         (3) \n \nwhere dk\/dt is the rate of change of the per capita capital stock, which is assumed to be equal \nto the flow of saving (equal to investment) minus capital depreciation and the growth of the \nlabour force. In this equation s is the share of gross saving in output per capita, \u03b4  is the \ndepreciation of capital and n the rate of growth of population as a proxy for the growth of the \nlabour force.  Setting (3) equal to zero gives us the steady state solution for the stock of per \ncapita capital; k=sy\/(n+\u03b4 ).  Taking the logarithm of both sides of equation (2) and replacing \nthe steady state solution for k from above into (2) gives the steady state solution for output \nper capita, which is as follows: \n \n*( ) [1\/(1 )][ ( \/( )]it it it it itln y ln A ln s n\u03b1 \u03b1 \u03b4= \u2212 + +      (4) \n \nWhere (*) above the variable signifies the steady state solution.   \n \nWe adopt the Mankiw et al. (1992) assumption that economies move towards their steady \nstate solution according to the following approximation: \n \n*\n0 0( )it i it iln y lny lny lny\u03bb\u2212 = \u2212        (5) \n \nwhere y0 stands for the initial level of per capita income, and (1 )te \u03b7\u03bb \u2212= \u2212  is the adjustment \ndynamic towards steady state, where ' '\u03b7  is the speed of convergence.  From (5) we can solve \nfor the growth of per capita output, which is as follows: \n \n 18\n*\n0( \/ ) ( )it it ig t lny lny\u03bb= \u2212        (6) \n \nReplacing ( *itlny ) by its equivalent from (4), gives us a relationship for actual growth of per \ncapita output: \n \n0( \/ (1 ))[ ( \/( )] ( \/ )it it it it it ig t ln A ln s n t lny\u03bb \u03b1 \u03b1 \u03b4 \u03bb= \u2212 + + \u2212    (7)  \n \n \nTotal factor productivity plays an important role in growth.

(1992) and Islam (1995).  Amongst the control variables \nincluded in most empirical research are initial conditions, both in terms of the level of \ndevelopment (as proxied by GDP per capita) as well as human capital and institutions.  Most \nalso include proxies for the macroeconomic environment such as inflation, trade openness \nand the government\u2019s involvement in economic activities.  Qualitative variables can also be \nadded to account for specific events in a country, as well as data heterogeneity when panel \ndata are used.  In our analysis, depending on the nature of data set constructed, we make use \nof all or some of these variables with the aim of ensuring that our regressions are \nappropriately specified. \n \nIn the context of our specification in (9), similar to Temple and Johnson (1995), we make the \nadditional assumption, drawing on the literature relating to regulation in developing countries \nreviewed earlier, that the rate of efficiency growth \u2019\u03b3 \u2019 directly varies with the quality of \nregulatory institutions in the country.  Those countries with good institutions in place can \ndesign and implement policies that allow them to continue with their future growth.  If \ninstead the country in question lacks or has a weak institutional structure, its growth potential \nis likely to be diminished because the design and implementation of appropriate policies are \nthen adversely affected.  In the case of developing countries, in particular, to be able to \nbenefit from being a latecomer in terms of industrialisation and grow at a high speed to \n\u201ccatch up\u201d, it is important that institutional supports are present to realise the potential for \nincome convergence.   \n \nOne of the control variables that is likely to be important in this context, is initial institutional \nquality.  In the absence of better information about the initial institutional quality, we adopted \n 20\neducational attainment as a proxy variable. At first reading this may seem an unusual choice, \nbut our proxy, secondary school enrolment, is correlated with the regulatory governance \nvariables we are using (see Table 1 below) and it has been successfully used as a proxy in \nother studies.5 The finding that education is highly correlated with our regulatory variables is \nan interesting finding in itself and one worthy of exploration in future research.  \n \nWe apply two methods of estimation to the model specified by equation (9).  One is based on \ncross-section analysis, in which we attempt to measure directly any possible impact that \nregulation has on economic growth.  The second is based on panel data, in which we \nindirectly estimate the growth contribution of regulation.  The reason for applying different \nestimation procedures is due to our data on the indexes of regulation; we have a few \nobservations per country. Therefore, for the cross-section regression we average the relevant \ndata over the period 1980-1999 and combine the result with the regulation data.6  This allows \na direct measure of the possible role that regulation plays in growth, using equation (9) as a \nbase to estimate 2\u03c6 .    In the second method we adopt a variant of the one applied by Olson et \nal. (1998) and apply the fixed effects technique7 to the panel data constructed.  This data set \ncombines cross-section and time-series data for the countries included in the first data set.  \nThis procedure, which essentially involves including a dummy for every country in the \nestimated equation, produces consistent estimates even where data are not available for some \ntime-invariant factors that affect growth.  The fixed effects estimator does require, however, \nthat each included variable varies significantly within countries.  Clearly, even if available, \nthe regulatory variables may not satisfy this requirement since institutions usually change \nslowly.  The estimation procedure, therefore, involves two stages. We first regress GDP per \ncapita growth in each country per period, ln ( \/( ))it it it it itg on s n \u03b4 \u03b3+ +  plus a set of country \ndummies.  The coefficient on the country dummies reflects the effect on growth of all the \n 21\ntime-invariant variables, including regulatory institutions.  In the second stage we use the \ncoefficients of the country dummies as the dependent variable and regress them on the \nmeasures of regulatory quality and control variables.  The coefficients on the measures of \nregulatory quality in the second stage regression reflect the impact of regulation on GDP per \ncapita growth after controlling for capital accumulation and certain other variables. \n \n \n4. THE DATA AND THE REGRESSION RESULTS \n \nData for the regulatory quality measures were set out in Kauffman et al (2005) and are \navailable for downloading from the World Bank web site.8  As discussed earlier, the two \nregulation indicators used from this study are regulatory quality and government \neffectiveness measures.  Other data required for the regression analysis were taken from the \nWorld Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators. \n \nThe data set used in the analysis covers 117 countries for the cross-section regression and 96 \nfor the panel version of the regression (for a full list of the countries see the Appendix).  \nAlthough the main focus of the study is the impact of regulation on economic performance in \ndeveloping countries, a heterogeneous data set was used including some transitional and \nadvanced countries as well as developing ones. The reason for including some non-\ndeveloping countries was to improve the statistical reliability of the results by including more \ncountries, with regional dummies used to capture the differing levels of economic \ndevelopment. However, as a cross-check on our results we repeated our analysis removing \nthe developed countries from the data base. The results were substantially unaffected (these \nresults can be obtained from the authors). As information on regulatory governance is only \n 22\nbased on one year, in the cross-section model, all other variables were converted into one \nperiod by averaging for 1980-2000.  Initial effect variables relate to 1980.  For the panel \nversion, the data cover the period 1980-2000 (in common with most empirical research in this \narea, and in order to remove short-term disturbances as well as business cycle effects from \nthe data, we have converted the time series data for the variables into 5-year period averages \ncovering 1980-84, 1985-89, 1990-94 and 1995-99). However, the time series dimension is \nnot complete for a number of the countries in the data set and therefore the panel data are \nunbalanced, containing 432 observations. Table 1 provides the correlation coefficient matrix \nfor the key variables used in the study. \n \n(Table 1) \n \nThe first data column in Table 1 shows the simple correlation coefficients between the \ndependent variable, GDP growth per capita, and possible explanatory variables.  The \ncorrelation coefficients have the expected signs.  The correlation coefficients between the \nindicators of regulatory governance, namely government effectiveness and regulatory quality, \nand GDP per capita growth have the expected positive sign.  The bivariate correlations \nbetween inflation and the regulatory proxies used are negative, supporting the proposition \nthat economies with better regulatory governance are also better able to design \nmacroeconomic policies that stabilise the economy and control inflation.  There is also a high \ncorrelation between the logarithm of initial GDP per capita and initial secondary school \neducation, both of which are in turn correlated with the various proxies for regulatory \ngovernance.9  This suggests that, included in the same regression, parameter estimates for \nthese variables may not be individually reliable, due to multicolinearity.  This is also the case \nwith the two regulatory proxies that we intend to use in the analysis, namely government \n 23\neffectiveness (GE) and regulatory quality (RQ).  These two are highly correlated and \ntherefore cannot be included in the same regression in order to estimate each variable's \ncontribution.  For this reason we considered first the contribution of each of these proxies to \ngrowth in separate regressions, and then combined them by addition to form a composite \nregulation variable  (RQGE). \n \nBefore formal analysis of the model specified in (9), we checked for the possibility of \nconvergence in our data.  In general, the literature does not support unconditional \nconvergence (Barro, 2000; Mankiw et al., 1992; Islam, 1995) but instead finds evidence of \nconditional convergence.   We investigated this issue using regulatory governance as a \npossible pre-condition for convergence.  Table 2 presents the results.  There is no indication \nof unconditional convergence (Reg. 1 and 2), the sign on the initial GDP per capita variable \n(LIGDPPC) is positive.  However, once an indicator of governance is included (RQ, GE and \nRQGE), as in Reg. 3 to 5, there is an indication of conditional convergence in the form of a \nnegative sign.  Differences between growth experiences of countries are partly explained by \ntheir state of regulatory quality.  There is no indication that there is any significant regional \ndifference in this context (cf. reg. 6-8, which include regional variables for Africa, Asia and \nLatin America).   \n \n(Table 2 here) \n \nIn addition to combining the two regulatory proxies (RQ and GE), and in the light of high \ncorrelation between the two, the first principal component of these two was generated \n(PCRQGE) and this composite index was used as a regulatory proxy.  Results generated \nbased on this proxy, as indicated by Reg 5a in table 2, are the same as those reported using \n 24\nRQ, GE and RQGE10.  We repeated this process taking into account the other four indicators \nof governance identified by Kauffman et al (2005) and detailed earlier. The first principal \ncomponent of all the six indicators of governance (termed PC All) was generated, as well as \none based on the four, excluding RQ and GE  - termed PC Others.  Reg 5b and Reg 5c in \nTable 2 include the results based on these composite indexes.  Inclusion of the four indicators \nof governance alongside or instead of the two regulatory proxies combined (RQGE) and its \nprincipal component (PCRQGE) has a marginal effect on the parameter estimates for the \nother variables in the regression, but the signs remain the same. The coefficient values for PC \nAll and PC Others are, however, lower than for the other regulation variables.  We interpret \nthis result as being an indication of the differential influence of different governance proxies \non growth.  In other words, a possible criticism of our findings that various measures on \ninstitutional quality could be highly correlated and that it is institutional quality rather than \nthe quality of regulation in particular that matters is not borne out. More precisely, the \nregulation proxies we have used (RQ, GE, RQGE and PCRQGE) seem to have a higher \nimpact on growth than the other four indicators of governance identified by Kauffman et al \n(2005) reflecting wider institutional factors. Therefore, regulation rather than governance \nissues more generally seems to have the larger impact on growth.11 \n \nHaving considered the issue of convergence and considered the possible relative effects of \nregulation and governance issues more generally on growth, Tables 3 and 4 report results \nbased on the formal analysis of the data. The results address the main focus of the research, \nthe impact of regulation on the growth in GDP per capita.  The results reported in Table 3 are \nbased on the model specified in equation (9) using OLS and cross-country data, as detailed \nabove. Table 3 reports ten regressions, each containing different combinations of the \nindependent variables in our data set. The economic variables in the full set of regressions \n 25\ntested included the variables derived from the model itself, as specified in equation (9), and \nmeasures for general inflation, trade, government expenditure, as well as the regional \ndummies.  However, with the exception of inflation these other variables proved to be \nstatistically insignificant at the 10% level or better and therefore, to economise on space, the \nresults are not reported. The inflation variable was found to be statistically significant and \nnegative, suggesting that unstable macroeconomic conditions have a negative effect on \neconomic growth.  \n \n(Table 3 here) \n \nThe regional dummies were used to test the hypothesis that different regions may have \ncharacteristics that affect growth differently.  This is validated with respect to Asia, \nconfirming that this region had, on average, performed better with respect to economic \ngrowth than other regions in the period studied.  A dummy for Africa and Latin America  \nwere found to be statistically insignificant.   We also included the initial level of human \ncapital, as measured be secondary school enrolments, as a proxy for the initial level of \n\u201cinstitutions\u201d.   As indicated in Table 1 this variable is highly correlated with initial GDP per \ncapita, and the results in Table 3 confirmed that it has a negative sign and is statistically \nsignificant.  This result supports the conditional convergence hypothesis.  \n \nThe regulatory variables are correctly signed and statistically significant in all cases.  The \nsign and level of significance of the parameter estimates for these regulatory proxies indicate \nthat they have a statistically significant and positive effect on economic growth.  Based on the \nestimates for the combined regulatory variable (RQGE), a unit change in the quality and \neffectiveness of regulation is, on average, associated with approximately an 0.6% to 0.9% \n 26\nincrease in economic growth, everything else remaining equal. As with the other results \nreported, the regulatory proxies used here seem to have a larger impact on growth than do the \nother governance proxies, namely the variables PC All and PC Others.   \n \nOne objection to our analysis so far is that we have used regulatory data for 2000 only. \nPerhaps the regulatory environment has changed substantially during the period 1980-2000. \nUnfortunately, World Bank regulatory data do not exist prior to 1996. But as a cross-check \non the stability of the results if regulatory data for other years from 1996 are used, we first \nconsidered the correlation between the World Bank regulatory indicators between 1996 and \n2000. The results gave correlation coefficients of 0.92 to 0.99 confirming a high degree of \nstability.  Nevertheless, we then re-ran our regression reported in Table 3 using regulatory \nindicators (constructed as before) but for 1996, 1998 and 2000 separately. The results were \nalmost identical. As discussed earlier, the stability in the governance variables plus the very \nlimited observations on governance (a maximum of two for each country) caused us to rule \nout the use of regressions based on panel data.  \n \n \n(Table 4 here) \n \nTable 4 reports results based on the second method of estimation, which, as discussed earlier, \ninvolves two stages.  In the first stage, by applying a fixed effect technique to the panel data, \nwe arrive at the following regression results: \n \nGDP per capita = 0.133 Log net12 gross capital formation \u2013 0.148 Log initial GDPPC \n   (6.41)*     (6.57)* \n 27\n+0.04 Log net schooling + Country Dummies  \n(1.84)** \n \nAdjusted R2 =0.21;  number of observations=432 \n \nThe figure in brackets is the t-ratio;  * (**) indicates significance level at 5% (10%).  From \nthe above, the regression parameter estimate associated with the country dummies is saved \nand used as the dependent variable in the regressions reported in Table 4. For reasons of \nspace we report only a sub-set of the full results. We exclude reporting regressions including \nthe full set of independent variables used, as detailed in Table 1, because a number of them \nproved to be statistically insignificant.  \n \nOur main interest in the regression results reported in Table 4 is with the role that the \nregulatory proxies are playing in explaining the variation in the country dummies. The results \nare consistent with those reported in Table 3. Even though the parameter estimates for the \nregulatory variable are lower, regulatory governance still affects the growth performance of \nan economy.  The regional dummies in this case are all negative and statistically significant, \nrelative to the control group which is advanced countries13.  These changes in the results were \ninvestigated and seem to reflect the differences in the modelling methods adopted, suggesting \nthat in this type of research the modelling can affect the results.  Nevertheless, the overall \npicture that emerges is that the quality and effectiveness of regulation has a positive effect on \ngrowth using both models. \n  \n \n 28\n5. CONCLUSIONS \n \nThe provision of a regulatory regime that promotes rather than constrains economic growth is \nan important part of good governance.  The ability of the state to provide effective regulatory \ninstitutions can be expected to be a determinant of how well markets and the economy \nperform.  The impact of regulatory institutions on economic growth will depend on both the \nefficiency of the regulatory policies and instruments that are used and the quality of the \ngovernance processes that are practised by the regulatory authorities, as discussed in the early \npart of the paper. \n \nThis paper has tested the hypothesis that the efficiency and quality of regulation affects the \neconomic performance of an economy.  Two proxies for regulatory effectiveness were \nincluded separately and then combined as determinants of economic growth performance, \nusing both cross-sectional and panel data methods.  The results from both sets of modelling \nsuggest a strong causal link between regulatory quality and economic growth and confirm \nthat the standard of regulation matters for economic performance.  The results are consistent \nwith those of Olson et al. (1998) who found that productivity growth is strongly correlated \nwith the quality of governance, and Kauffman et al (2005) who found that the quality of \ngovernance has a positive effect on incomes. \n \nAs we highlighted earlier, the proxies we use for regulatory governance are correlated with a \nnumber of other institutional proxies.  One could argue, therefore, that what we have \nestablished could equally hold for the link between institutional capacity in general and \neconomic performance.  However, the literature reviewed earlier in the paper is consistent \nwith institutional capacity playing a strong and complementary role to regulatory governance \n 29\nand the principal component analysis undertaken is supportive of this view. Nevertheless, the \nability to model separately institutions in general and regulatory institutions or governance in \nparticular remains problematic because of their potential complementarity. Hence, our results \nare perhaps most safely interpreted as demonstrating the importance of regulatory quality for \neconomic growth in the context of wider institutional capacity building.   \n \nAlso, we acknowledge that in our analysis there is no control for the different regulated \nindustrial sectors including privatised industries. Hence, the results need to be interpreted \nwith care because of the heterogeneity of the sectors covered. The possibility that regulatory \nquality inputs differently across different industrial sectors cannot be ruled out. \nUnfortunately, data limitations prevented us from pursuing this issue. Finally, we \nacknowledge that the direction of causation between economic growth and regulatory quality \ndeserves further investigation,   Nevertheless, despite these caveats, we believe that there are \ngood a priori grounds for assuming that better regulation leads to more rapid economic \ngrowth and that our empirical results are consistent with the view that \u201cgood\u201d regulation is \nassociated with higher economic growth in lower-income economies.  \n \n 30\nAPPENDIX \n(a) List of countries included in the dataset14: \n \nAngola; Albania; Argentina; Australia; Austria; Azerbaijan; Belgium; Benin; Burkina Faso; \nBangladesh; Bulgaria; Belarus; Bolivia; Brazil; Botswana; Canada; Switzerland; Chile; \nChina; Cote d'Ivoire; Cameroon; Congo, Rep.; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cyprus; Czech \nRepublic; Denmark; Dominican Republic; Algeria; Ecuador; Egypt, Arab Rep.; Spain; \nEstonia; Ethiopia; Finland; France; Gabon; United Kingdom; Georgia; Ghana; Guinea; \nGambia; Greece; Guatemala; Guyana; Hong Kong (China); Honduras; Croatia; Haiti; \nHungary; Indonesia; India; Ireland; Iran, Islamic Rep.; Iceland; Israel; Italy; Jamaica; Jordan; \nJapan; Kazakhstan; Kenya; Kyrgyz Republic; Korea, Rep.; Lebanon; Sri Lanka; Lesotho; \nLithuania; Luxembourg; Latvia; Morocco; Moldova; Mexico; Macedonia; Mali; Malta; \nMozambique; Mauritius; Malawi; Malaysia; Niger; Nigeria; Nicaragua; Netherlands; \nNorway;  New Zealand; Pakistan; Panama; Peru; Philippines; Papua New Guinea; Poland; \nPortugal; Paraguay; Romania; Russian Federation; Senegal; Singapore; Sierra Leone; El \nSalvador; Sweden; Syrian Arab Republic; Togo; Thailand; Trinidad and Tobago; Tunisia; \nTurkey; Tanzania; Uganda; Ukraine; Uruguay; United States; Venezuela; Vietnam; Congo, \nDem.

The World Bank defines good governance as \u201cepitomized by predictable, open and enlightened policy \nmaking; a bureaucracy imbued with a professional ethos; an executive arm of government \naccountable for its actions; a strong civil society participating in public affairs, and all behaving under \nthe rule of law\u201d (World Bank, 1997). \n2. One of the authors of this paper has been involved in the design of regulatory institutions for Malawi. \n3. This expresses the observed data in each cluster as a linear function of the unobserved common \ncomponent of governance, plus a disturbance term to capture perception errors and sampling variation \nin each indicator. \n4. However, neither neoclassical nor endogenous growth theory gave regulation an explicit role.  By \nassuming that output is at the limit provided by the available factor inputs and technology, \nneoclassical growth theory implicitly assumed no regulatory distortions. \n5. Benhabib and Spiegel (1994) argue that the initial level of human capital can affect the growth path of \nproductivity.  Olson et al (1998) also use secondary school enrolment as a proxy explanatory variable \nin their growth study. \n6. The most recent data set provided by Kauffman et al (2005) provides bi-annual data on indicators of \ngovernance over the period 1996-2004.  In common with most empirical research in this area, we \nhave converted time series data on the variables we have used in this study into 5-year averages for \nthe period 1980-2000.  However, if we were to do the same with the regulatory indices available it \nwould give us only one observation for each country.  If we were to extend our data to 2004, we \nwould get two observations on these indices.  Time dimensions of data on regulatory governance in \neither case would be too few to be able to apply panel data.  In addition, given that these indicators \nchange very slowly over time, as also acknowledged by Kauffman et al., and that they only relate to \nthe most recent periods, we do not find it informative to try to use them in a panel data analysis.  We \nwere able to confirm the stability of the regulation variables by replacing the data for 2000 with data \nfor 1996 and 1998. The effect on our results was negligible (the results can be obtained from the \nauthors). \n7. There are two estimation procedures for panel data, fixed and random effects.  In our case, the fixed \neffect method is the more appropriate one to use for the following reasons: (a) a priori we expect that \n 32\nregulatory governance proxies to be correlated with the intercept term for each country;  those with a \npoor or weak regulatory governance are also expected to perform relatively badly in terms of \neconomic performance; (b) we are interested in measuring differences between countries included in \nour data set;  the parameter estimate for country dummies (the intercept term for each country) is a \nproxy for these differences.  Intercepts in turn are used as a dependent variable in the second stage \nregression to establish the link between regulatory governance and country characteristics captured by \nthe intercept term.  The fixed effects method allows us to do this;  (c) in small samples, similar to the \none we are using here, there may be practical problems preventing parameter estimation when the \nrandom effect model is applied;  this is not the case with the fixed effect model.  For a more detailed \ndiscussion of these issues, see Verbeek (2000).  Also, we applied the Hausman specification test and \nthis confirmed that the fixed effect model is the more appropriate technique for our data. \n8. http:\/\/www.worldbank.org\/wbi\/governance\/pubs\/govmatters4.html  The series constructed are \ncomposite indexes, which are based on a number of variables generated at different points in time.  \nInformation for each country on these proxies, therefore, generally relates to a period rather than a \nspecific year.  Kauffman and Kraay (2005) highlight certain issues relating to the quality of the data \nused, particularly when it is utilised for making comparisons across countries.  However, we are not \naware of better regulatory quality data, while conceding that better quality data could reveal different \nresults to those reported here.  Nevertheless, based on the significance level of the relevant variables \nin our regressions, we are fairly confident that any differences in the results would relate to the \nmagnitude of these effects rather than their sign. \n9. A number of the explanatory variables were logged.  In the literature the basic growth accounting \nmodel is generally exponential (e.g. Cobb-Douglas).  Once logged, it becomes a linear relationship \nwhich can then be estimated.  For the other explanatory variables in our model, logging helped to \nsolve problems of serial correlation and heteroscedasticity. \n10. The difference in parameter estimates for the regulatory index is due to the scale effect generated by \nthe weight used in calculating the first principal component of the two indicators. \n11. However, we would not wish to over-emphasise the importance of this result given the data \nlimitations as pointed out in Kauffman et al (2005). One could also argue that different proxies may \nhave different dynamic effects on growth and that broader indicators of governance may require a \nlonger period of time to produce their full effect on economic growth. \n 33\n12. Net in this case applies to the log difference of different investment shares in GDP (physical and \nhuman in this case) and (d+n+g), where d is the rate of depreciation of capital per annum; n is the rate \nof population growth and g is a proxy for rate of technical change.  As is the practice in the literature, \n(d+g) is assumed to be 5%.  The specification is based on a Solow\/Augmented Solow model. \n13. In this model the regional dummies identify whether there are regional similarities or differences \nbetween regions. \n \n \n 34\n \nREFERENCES \n \nAcemoglu D., Johnson, S. & Robinson, J.
