Introduction\n[2] Pumping the ionosphere with high-power high-\nfrequency (HF) radio waves, typically in the range 2\u2013\n10 MHz, can induce several instabilities, which result in\nelectron acceleration. These electrons excite the neutral\natmospheric constituents by collisions. A fraction of this\nenergy is released as photons with wavelengths identical to\nthe natural auroras. Themost easily observed artificial optical\nemissions are O(1D) 630 nm and O(1S) 557.7 nm, with\nthresholds of \u00012 and \u00014.2 eV, respectively, although the\neffective threshold for O(1D) is \u00013.5 eV because of the\npresence of N2 [Haslett and Megill, 1974]. The phenomenon\nhas been known at mid- and low latitudes since the 1970s;\nhowever, it has only been unambiguously observed at high\nlatitudes fairly recently, notably at the European Incoherent\nScatter facility (EISCAT, 69.59\u0001N, 19.23\u0001E) in Norway\n[Bra\u00a8ndstro\u00a8m et al., 1999] and at the High-Frequency Active\nAuroral Research Program facility (HAARP, 62.39\u0001N,\n145.15\u0001W) in Alaska [Pedersen and Carlson, 2001]. Con-\ntrolled experiments, such as described below, are important\nfor understanding natural electron acceleration and precipi-\ntation processes [e.g., Samara et al., 2004] as well as testing\nwave-plasma interaction theories. In addition, the optical\nobservations during ionospheric pumping experiments give\ninformation about the neutrals [e.g., Gustavsson et al., 2001]\nas well as reveal the energy spectrum of the accelerated\nelectrons [Gustavsson et al., 2005].\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 112, A06325, doi:10.1029\/2006JA012146, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Space Vehicles Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory, Hanscom\nAFB, Bedford, Massachusetts, USA.\n2Communication Systems, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK.\n3Honorary Research Fellow, University of Kwazulu-Natal, Durban,\nSouth Africa.\n4Institute for Scientific Research, Boston College, Chestnut Hill,\nMassachusetts, USA.\n5Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Alaska, USA.\n6Solar-Terrestrial Environment Laboratory, Nagoya University, Nagoya,\nJapan.\n7Physical Sciences, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona\nBeach, Florida, USA.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/07\/2006JA012146$09.00\nA06325 1 of 13\n[3] EISCAT has two colocated incoherent scatter radars,\nwhich observe the pump-induced electron Langmuir (L) and\nion-acoustic waves (IA) as well as allow measurement of\nartificial electron- and ion-temperature enhancements.\nThese show electron- and ion-temperature enhancements\nup to \u00014000 K and \u0001500 K, respectively [Rietveld et al.,\n2003]. Colocated at HAARP is the Modular UHF Iono-\nspheric Radar (MUIR) [Oyama et al., 2006], which is\ncapable of observing the pump-induced L and IA waves\nbut not the incoherent scatter spectrum without several\nminutes of integration. Hence extracting ion and electron\ntemperatures with integration times of seconds is not\npossible at HAARP. Both facilities have well located Super\nDual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) HF radars\n[Kodiak for HAARP and Cooperative UK Twin Located\nAuroral Sounding System (CUTLASS) for EISCAT], capa-\nble of observing field-aligned plasma irregularities, called\nstriations, which are symbiotic with upper-hybrid (UH)\nelectrostatic waves [e.g., Kosch et al., 2002a, 2002b;\nHughes et al., 2003, 2004], as well as various optical\ninstruments.\n[4] Most ionospheric modification phenomena are sensi-\ntive to the pump frequency relative to multiples (n) of the\nelectron gyrofrequency, and these have been extensively\ntested for n \u0002 3 [e.g., Kosch et al., 2005]. HAARP is able to\npump the ionosphere on the second electron gyroharmonic\n(GH) [e.g., Djuth et al., 2005], which has produced some\nunique features [Kosch et al., 2005; Mishin et al., 2005a]\ndescribed below. HF and ultra high frequency (UHF) radar,\nas well as optical, observations for a pump frequency pass\nthrough the second GH are the primary focus here, improv-\ning upon the first attempt which was limited to optical data\nonly [Kosch et al., 2005].\n[5] Generally, there are three main resonant wave inter-\nactions that occur for O-mode electromagnetic wave (EMO)\npumping of the ionospheric plasma [e.g., Mishin et al.,\n2005a], all resulting in electron acceleration. First, near the\nHF pump reflection level where the pump and plasma\nfrequencies match, L and IA waves may be produced by\neither parametric decay (PDIL), EMO ! L + IA, or the\noscillating two-stream instabilities (OTSIL), i.e., EMO !\nL + dne, where density irregularities are denoted by dne.\nUsually, PDIL and OTSIL are associated with weak and\nstrong plasma turbulence, respectively [e.g., Fejer, 1979].\nThese electrostatic plasma waves (L and IA) propagate\nnear-parallel to the magnetic field direction. Both IA and\nL waves are routinely detected by UHF or very-high-\nfrequency (VHF) radars colocated with the HF pump wave\nsource as ion- or plasma-line backscatter enhancements,\nrespectively. This mechanism is fast acting (<10 ms) [e.g.,\nDjuth et al., 2004].\n[6] For magnetic zenith (MZ) injections, i.e., zenith angle\nc \u000113\u0001 at EISCAT and c \u000115\u0001 at HAARP (where c is the\nmagnetic field zenith angle), which are outside the Spitze\ncone (c \u00016\u0001 at EISCAT and c \u00018\u0001 at HAARP), the pump\nwaves refract down in altitude [e.g., Kosch et al., 2002a],\nthereby lowering the reflection altitude. The large frequency\nmismatch [see e.g., DuBois et al., 1993] makes OTSIL\ndevelopment practically impossible by requiring an unreal-\nistically high pump power. However, UHF radar observa-\ntions do show significant plasma- and ion-line backscatter\nenhancements [Ashrafi et al., 2007; Dhillon and Robinson,\n2005; Oyama et al., 2006]. Gurevich et al. [1999, 2002]\nsuggested that pump-induced striations would allow fre-\nquency matching for PDIL outside the Spitze cone to occur\nowing to ducting of the pump wave inside the plasma\ndepletions. Mishin et al. [2001] noted that, since the zenith\nangle of the magnetic field at high latitudes is small, a\nsignificant field-parallel component of the pump-wave\nelectric field vector is present in the region of downward\nrefraction. Furthermore, the matching condition for PDIL can\nbe achieved outside the Spitze cone (see below). Simulta-\nneous observations of SuperDARN HF radar backscatter\nfrom striations and EISCAT UHF radar ion-line enhance-\nments, along with artificial optical emissions, provide\nevidence of Langmuir turbulence in the MZ outside the\nSpitze cone at high latitude (Ashrafi et al., 2007) Here we\nprovide further evidence for the PDIL mechanism for pump-\ning in the MZ outside the Spitze cone at HAARP, in\nconjunction with optical observations, and estimate the\nmaximum zenith angle for which this may occur.\n[7] Second, UH and electron Bernstein (EB) electrostatic\nwaves coupled to lower hybrid (LH) waves may be pro-\nduced by parametric decay (PDIUH\/EB) of the pump wave,\ni.e., EMO! UH\/EB + LH [e.g., Istomin and Leyser, 1995].\nThe UH\/EB and LH electrostatic waves propagate near-\nperpendicular to the magnetic field line. Whether UH or EB\nwaves are excited depends on the dispersion characteristics\nof the plasma wave associated with the pump frequency\nused. This mechanism is rapid (<10 ms) and has a low\nthreshold of excitation [e.g.,Mishin et al., 2005a]. PDIUH\/EB\ncan occur anywhere where suitable local ionospheric con-\nditions exist, including in the MZ outside the Spitze cone\nand in a nominally underdense ionosphere [Mishin et al.,\n2005b]. Significantly for producing artificial optical emis-\nsions, the collapse of field-aligned LH wave plasma density\ncavities causes electron acceleration along the magnetic\nfield line by Landau damping [Musher et al., 1978; Mishin\net al., 2004].\n[8] Natural LH waves are known to occur in the topside\nauroral ionosphere and have been observed by rockets\n[Vago et al., 1992] and low-altitude satellites [Kjus et al.,\n1998]. These waves are mostly associated with field-aligned\nplasma density depletions, the collapse of which results in\nparticle acceleration [Robinson et al., 1996a, 1996b]. The\nLH wave frequency in the ionosphere is \u00018 kHz. Pump-\ninduced UH\/EB waves have been observed directly by the\nKodiak SuperDARN HF radar [Hughes et al., 2003, 2004],\nbut no evidence for LH waves have been published. Mishin\net al. [2004] provided evidence that this mechanism exists\nbased on the rapid optical response at pump on, although\nthere is ambiguity with the PDIL mechanism described\nearlier. In addition, Kuo et al. [1997] showed that UH\nwaves can excite short-scale oblique L waves via the\noscillating two-stream instability of the primary UH waves\n(OTSIUH). Nonlinear interactions then result in rapid wave-\nspectrum broadening of the L waves [Mishin et al., 2004].\nDespite the modest output power at low pump frequencies\n(e.g., 2.85 MHz), the threshold for PDIUH\/EB can be\nexceeded at HAARP [Mishin et al., 2004]. Here we provide\nevidence for PDIUH\/EB mechanism, as well as for LH waves\nin SuperDARN radar centerline data for the first time, in\nconjunction with optical observations.\nA06325 KOSCH ET AL.: SECOND GYROHARMONIC RESULTS AT HAARP\n2 of 13\nA06325\n[9] Third, UH waves may be generated by the thermal\nparametric instability (TPIUH) [e.g., Grach et al., 1981;\nDysthe et al., 1982]. The electromagnetic pump wave (fO)\nis converted into UH electrostatic waves (fUH) on naturally\noccurring magnetic field-aligned plasma density irregulari-\nties (called striations) for fO = fUH =\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nf 2P \u00fe f 2C\nq\n, where fP is the\nlocal plasma frequency (fP \u2019 9 ffiffiffiffinep kHz, ne is the plasma\ndensity in cm\u00073), and fC is the local electron gyrofrequency\nwhich is proportional to magnetic-field strength. The UH\nplasma waves propagate near-perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield direction and can be trapped within the meter-scale\nstriations, heating the plasma further, causing further deple-\ntion and trapping on a timescale of several seconds in a\npositive feedback cycle [Grach et al., 1981; Dysthe et al.,\n1982], i.e., EMO ! UH + dne. Whenever significant back-\nground meter-scale density irregularities are present, the so-\ncalled resonance instability develops where the magnitudes\nof the waves and striations grow explosively [Vaskov and\nGurevich, 1977].\n[10] The UH resonance altitude (HUHR) is typically a few\n(3\u20138) km below the HF reflection altitude (HO where fO =\nfP). Hence the cone where TPIUH is possible is greater than\nthe Spitze cone. The TPIUH cone size is a function of the HF\npump wave refraction, which depends on the pump fre-\nquency and electron-density height profile. Mishin et al.\n[2005b] showed that for MZ pointing, pumping below fC\/\nsinc\b5.5 and \b6.3 MHz at HAARP and EISCAT,\nrespectively, would ensure that UH resonance would be\nreached. Since artificial optical emission experiments occur\nonly at night when the ionosphere is weak, this pump-\nfrequency limitation is of no practical consequence. Gener-\nally, the TPIUH is easily stimulated in the MZ at HAARP\nand EISCAT, i.e., at high latitudes, even at low pump\npowers (<4 MW effective radiated power) [Wright et al.,\n2006]. Meter-scale pump-enhanced striations are routinely\nobserved by the SuperDARN radars and are clearly associ-\nated with artificial optical emissions [e.g., Kosch et al.,\n2002a, 2002b]. EB waves are not trapped inside the stria-\ntions and therefore do not contribute to TPIUH [Mj\u00f8lhus,\n1993]. At pump on, it is common for an UHF radar to\nobserve the PDIL\/OTSIL mechanism signature in the initial\nseconds until the TPIUH mechanism takes over as the\nstriations grow. This manifests itself as a strong ion-line\n(IA waves) or plasma-line (L waves) backscatter overshoot,\nwhich is subsequently quenched within seconds because of\nanomalous absorption on the striations [e.g., Stubbe et al.,\n1994]. Fully established striations almost completely absorb\nthe pump wave [Stubbe, 1996], thereby preventing PDIL\/\nOTSIL, which can only occur above the UH resonance\naltitude [e.g., Stubbe et al., 1994]. Here we provide evi-\ndence for the TPIUH mechanism operating asymmetrically\nabout the second GH.\n[11] Mishin et al. [2005a] showed that both the TPIUH\nand PDIUH\/EB mechanisms could exist simultaneously for\ncertain pump frequency regimes about the second GH,\ndepending on the dispersion characteristics of the plasma\nwaves, although they neglected the PDIL mechanism. The\nability to stimulate two mechanisms for electron acceleration\nprovides an explanation for the unusually intense artificial\noptical emission observed when pumping near the second\nGH in the MZ at HAARP [Kosch et al., 2005]. Ashrafi et al.\n[2007] also provided evidence for two simultaneous mech-\nanisms by observing the simultaneous production of stria-\ntions (TPIUH) and IA waves (EMO ! L + IA) when\npumping near the fourth GH in the MZ at EISCAT. Here\nwe provide evidence for up to three simultaneous electron\nacceleration mechanisms.\n[12] Most ionospheric modification effects are sensitive\nto the pump frequency relative to the electron GH frequency\n[e.g., Kosch et al., 2005]. For the third and higher GH,\nartificial optical emissions usually minimize [Kosch et al.,\n2002b; Gustavsson et al., 2006]. The growth of striations,\nand by association UH waves, are suppressed when pump-\ning on the third or higher GH frequency [Huang and Kuo,\n1994; Honary et al., 1995; Robinson et al., 1996a, 1996b].\nHuang and Kuo [1994] and Istomin and Leyser [2003]\npredicted theoretically that UH waves and striations, and\ntherefore also artificial optical emissions, would be stronger\nfor pump frequencies just above a GH frequency compared\nto below it, i.e., an asymmetry would exist. By the same\ntoken, Grach [1979] and Kuo and Rubinraut [2005] have\nshown that efficient electron acceleration by UH waves\ngenerated via TPIUH near 2fC occurs just above the GH\nfrequency. For both these effects, there is optical evidence\n[Gustavsson et al., 2006; Kosch et al., 2005] as well as\nSuperDARN radar evidence of striation intensity [Kosch\net al., 2002b], although the authors did not address this\nlatter point directly. Here we provide further HF radar\nevidence of the asymmetry effect of the TPIUH mechanism\nabout the second GH.\n[13] Honary et al. [1999] have shown that PDIL\/OTSIL\npersists when pumping on the third or higher GH frequency\nbecause the growth of striations is suppressed [e.g.,\nPonomarenko et al., 1999; Kosch et al., 2002b]. Hence\nthe HF pump wave can reach the higher L wave matching\nheight or near to it when pumping outside the Spitze cone\nwithout being dissipated at the lower UH resonance altitude\nby mode conversion into UH waves. Artificial optical\nemissions associated with persistent Langmuir turbulence\non the fourth GH have been observed [Ashrafi et al., 2007;\nKosch et al., 2004]. The colocated UHF radar (EISCAT)\nobserved a persistent ion-line (IA waves) or plasma-line\n(L waves) backscatter enhancement throughout the pump-\ning pulse. Since the pump GH frequency must be selected\nwithin kHz and the ionosphere is never stationary for long,\nit is practically difficult to prevent striation growth com-\npletely, although growth proceeds much more slowly. This\nmanifests itself as a decline in UHF radar ion- or plasma-\nline backscatter power during the pump pulse. Here we\nprovide UHF radar evidence of L waves for both suppressed\nand strong striation growth.\n[14] The high electron temperatures (up to 4000 K)\nobserved during pump-induced artificial optical emissions\n[Rietveld et al., 2003] may account for a significant fraction\nof the O(1D) 630-nm emission [Ashrafi et al., 2007] but\ncan not account for the O(1S) 557.7-nm or other higher-\nthreshold emissions [Gustavsson et al., 2002]. Hence a\nsignificant but small fraction of the electrons must be\naccelerated to suprathermal energies [Gustavsson et al.,\n2005]. To date, observations of pump-induced optical\nemissions are limited by the photon detection technology\navailable and low (subvisual) optical intensities, hence\nmost results focus on the steady state 630 nm emission,\nA06325 KOSCH ET AL.: SECOND GYROHARMONIC RESULTS AT HAARP\n3 of 13\nA06325\nwhich is partly due to the TPIUH mechanism. Here we\nprovide optical data down to new levels, i.e., a few\nRayleighs.\n[15] Kosch et al. [2005] have summarized past results\nfrom pumping near the second GH. Striations and UH\nwaves, as observed by coherent radar backscatter, occurred\n[Fialer, 1974; Minkoff et al., 1974] along with artificial\noptical emissions [Sipler and Biondi, 1972]. Coherent\nbackscatter was enhanced [Fialer, 1974], and optical emis-\nsions become significantly brighter [Haslett and Megill,\n1974] when the pump frequency happened to be close to\nthe second GH. In addition, Fialer [1974] noted that\ncoherent backscatter power, i.e., striations, maximized when\npumping just above the second GH. This is consistent with\noptical observations about the second GH [Kosch et al.,\n2005]. Here we provide further radar and optical evidence\nof this asymmetry effect.\n[16] During the first pump frequency pass through the\nsecond GH in the MZ at HAARP, Kosch et al. [2005] and\nMishin et al. [2005a] found several novel features. First,\nthere was no minimum in the intensity of the artificial\noptical emissions, as is expected for higher GHs [Kosch\net al., 2002b; Gustavsson et al., 2006]. Second, the intensity\nof the artificial optical emissions maximized for pump\nfrequencies just above the second GH. The same trend is\nobserved for higher GHs [Gustavsson et al., 2006]. Third,\nthe maximum in optical intensity was not associated with a\nchange in electron energy spectrum, only flux. Fourth, the\nintensity of the 630 nm emission almost doubled when the\nplasma frequency at the pump-wave reflection altitude\npassed through the second GH, i.e., fP (H2fCO) = 2fCO, and\nwhen the F-peak critical frequency passed through the\nsecond GH, i.e., fOF2 = 2fC (HfOF2). These observations\nsuggest that L waves participated in cyclotron acceleration of\nelectrons [Mishin et al., 2005a]. In addition, optical emissions\nwere produced for pump frequencies up to 400 kHz above the\nionospheric critical frequency, consistent with Pedersen et al.\n[2003] andMishin et al. [2005b], and irregular shaped optical\nstructures, not necessarily in the pump beam center, appeared\nwhen pumping in this regime.\n[17] Usually, when pumping into the MZ, an optical blob\nwhich is significantly smaller than the pump beam is\nproduced [e.g., Kosch et al., 2005; Pedersen et al., 2003;\nRietveld et al., 2003]. Djuth et al. [2005] estimated the\nangular width of the optical blob at HAARP to be \u00018\u0001 with\na pump beam size of \u000132 \t 45\u0001. Pedersen et al. [2003]\nfound the average angular size to be \u00017\u0001 for over 1000\nimages but for a variety of beam sizes. Attempts to observe\nstriations using the Kodiak SuperDARN radar while pump-\ning near the second GH failed [Djuth et al., 2005; Kosch\net al., 2005], primarily because of propagation conditions\nnot satisfying the backscatter orthogonality requirement at\n10 MHz [Kosch et al., 2005]. In addition, Djuth et al. and\nKosch et al. [2005] had no means to observe L waves.\nBoth these radar observational problems are successfully\naddressed here.\n[18] The dispersion curves of the plasma electrostatic\nwaves for pump frequencies around the second GH show\nthat UH and EB plasma waves will exist above and below\nthe second GH, respectively [Grach, 1979; Mishin et al.,\n2005a]. This is significant because only UH waves are\ntrapped in the density depletions of striations and contribute\nto the TPIUH mechanism. Here we provide radar and optical\nevidence for this effect. Fejer and Leer [1972] suggested\nthat EB waves might be excited by X-mode pumping. More\nspecifically, Das and Fejer [1979] predicted theoretically\nthat X-mode pumping on the second GH would produce\nstriations. Our observations do not confirm this.\n[19] Double resonance, i.e., the GH at UH resonance,\noccurs when fO = nfC = fUHR, where fO is known, nfC is\nderived from the International Geomagnetic Reference Field\n(IGRF) model, and fP is derived from ionosonde data. The\nthreshold for TPIUH decreases significantly, while the max-\nimum growth rate increases close to this frequency regime\n[Grach et al., 1994; Norin et al., 2006]. As the HF reflection\/\nrefraction altitude increases for a fixed pump frequency in a\ndecaying ionosphere after sunset, fC decreases. Selecting the\ncorrect pump frequency in advance ensures that plasma\nresonance, i.e., fO = fP, and double resonance will be found,\nand a single pump frequency pass through the second GH\nwill automatically be executed for both resonances.\n[20] Stimulated electromagnetic emissions (SEE) are a\ncommon feature of ionospheric-pumping experiments. SEE\nspectral features provide many clues to the wave-plasma\nprocesses and have been extensively studied [e.g., Leyser,\n2001]. Fundamentally, the SEE are due to the electromag-\nnetic pump wave mode converting into electrostatic plasma\nwaves, typically on density perturbations, and then recon-\nverting back to electromagnetic waves after some interac-\ntion or cascade process, which propagate back down to the\nground [e.g., Carozzi et al., 2002]. The downshifted max-\nimum (DM) is a common spectral feature for pump fre-\nquencies not on the third and higher GHs and is usually\nassociated with UH wave-induced striations. The DM\nfeature has been observed for pumping just below the\nsecond GH [Djuth et al., 2005].\n[21] This paper presents multiwavelength optical data and\nbackscatter from two radar systems (section 2) along with\ntheir theoretical analysis (section 3) for pumping of the\nionospheric plasma by high-power HF radio waves near the\nsecond GH.\n2. Results\n[22] On 4 February 2005, the HAARP facility was\noperated at 2.85 MHz between 03:00 and 05:50 UT\nimmediately after sunset, with \u000111 MW effective radiated\npower (ERP), corresponding to a beam size of \u000132 \t 45\u0001,\nand pointing into the MZ (204\u0001 azimuth, 75\u0001 elevation).\nStarting at 03 UT, a pump modulation of 60 s off, 60 s\nO-mode, 60 s off, and 60 s X-mode was used to perform a\nsingle frequency pass through the second electron GH while\nsearching for known O- and predicted X-mode resonances.\nGeomagnetic conditions were very quiet (Kp = 0).\n[23] The colocated Digisonde provided ionospheric den-\nsity profiles every 2 min in the range 1\u20136 MHz. The Kodiak\nSuperDARN radar [e.g., Hughes et al., 2003, 2004], located\n\u0001650 km southwest of HAARP, was operating on beam 9\nonly, which overlooks HAARP, with 15 km range resolution\nand 1 s integration. The radar cycled through six frequen-\ncies (8.05, 9.35, 10.35, 11.55, 12.14, and 13.505 MHz) in\norder to ensure the best possibility for satisfying backscatter\northogonality conditions. The colocated 446 MHz MUIR\n[Oyama et al., 2006], which had just been commissioned,\nA06325 KOSCH ET AL.: SECOND GYROHARMONIC RESULTS AT HAARP\n4 of 13\nA06325\nused a simple long-pulse transmission while recording\nplasma-line data on a single receiver channel only. The\nbeam (\u00073 dB beam size \u00018.6\u0001) was pointing into the MZ\nwith a transmitter pulse of 998 ms (\u0001150 km), receiver\ngating of 10 ms (\u00011.5 km), and a data dump time of 10 ms.\nThe upshifted plasma-line was observed from 03:17 to\n03:39 UT, followed by downshifted plasma-line from\n03:41 to 04:36 UT with a short data gap in between.\n[24] All-sky optical recordings were performed by the\ncolocated HAARP imager, alternating between the O(1S)\n(557.7 nm) and O(1D) (630 nm) emissions with 15 s\nintegration, which were synchronized to start with\n557.7 nm at each full minute. This gives a 557.7 (630)\nnm image integrated in the period 0\u201315 (15\u201330) s and\n30\u201345 (45\u201360) s of each minute. Optical viewing con-\nditions were ideal with clear sky, natural aurora on the\nfar northern horizon only, and sunset twilight contamina-\ntion on the western horizon.\n[25] Figure 1 gives an overview of the observations. The\nlabeled vertical dotted lines indicate significant times.\nFigure 1a shows the ionospheric critical frequency ( foF2)\nfrom Digisonde data. The horizontal dashed line denotes\npump frequency (2.85 MHz), which exceeded foF2 after\n\u000104:12 UT (label 5). Figure 1b shows the O-mode reflec-\ntion (positive sign), upper-hybrid resonance (multiplication\nsign), and X-mode reflection (asterisk) altitudes over\nHAARP at 2.85 MHz, also from Digisonde data. The dashed\nhorizontal line at \u0001225 km altitude corresponds to the\nsecond electron GH as determined by the IGRF magnetic\nfield model. The solid diagonal line gives the solar termi-\nnator altitude. O- and X-mode pump pulses are denoted by\nthe solid and unshaded bars, respectively. Clearly, as time\nprogresses, the HF reflection and UH resonance altitudes\nascend. At \u000103:45 UT (label 4), the UH resonance altitude\npassed through the second GH, i.e., the double resonance.\nAt \u000104:12 UT (label 5), the ionospheric O-mode critical\nfrequency reached 2.85 MHz, corresponding to the solar\nterminator ascending through the F-region peak altitude. At\n\u000104:34 UT (label 6), UH resonance ceased with X-mode\nreflection continuing to the end of the experiment. The\nDigisonde data are dominated by echoes from the local\nzenith, whereas HF pumping took place in the MZ some\n60 km away in the F layer. Although not perfectly colo-\ncated, the measurement uncertainty introduced is expected\nto be smaller than that associated with scaling the iono-\ngrams, typically \u00b110 km [Kosch et al., 2005].\n[26] Figures 1c and 1d show the average background-\nsubtracted and calibrated 630 and 557.7 nm optical inten-\nsity, respectively. The dashed and solid curves are for cones\nof \u00012.5\u0001 and \u000120\u0001 diameter centered on the MZ. The wide\ncone covers most of the artificially induced optical emis-\nsions, whereas the narrow cone covers the central bright\nspot within the artificially induced optical emission (see\nFigure 2, discussed below). Background subtraction is\nnecessary because of the changing twilight illumination.\nThe background was a piecewise linear fit to the data point\nat the end of each 4 min cycle, introducing an uncertainty of\n<0.5 R. The intrinsic noise level of the optical data is <1 R.\nThe 630 nm optical intensity in the MZ (Figure 1c), peaking\nat \u000158 R, is approximately double that averaged over much\nof the beam, peaking at \u000124 R. The 557.7 nm emission is\nsimilar (Figure 1d ), peaking at \u000117 R in the MZ and \u00017 R\nFigure 1. (a) The ionospheric critical frequency with time\nfrom colocated Digisonde data.

The labeled vertical dotted\nlines indicate significant times referred to in the text.\nA06325 KOSCH ET AL.: SECOND GYROHARMONIC RESULTS AT HAARP\n5 of 13\nA06325\nover much of the beam. Clearly, both optical emissions are\nenhanced during the O-mode pump pulses. Camera satura-\ntion due to twilight renders the optical data useless prior to\n\u000103:10 UT. No optical emissions are produced during\nthe X-mode pump pulses. The single 630 nm pulse at\n\u000104:39 UT during X-mode pumping is the result of man-\nmade light contamination.\n[27] The 630 nm emission provides clear evidence of\nelectron heating, whereas the 557.7 nm emission provides\nclear evidence of suprathermal electron acceleration\n[Gustavsson et al., 2002]. Since 60 s pumping is not long\nenough to ensure that the 630 nm emission reaches full\nsaturation in the F layer [e.g., Gustavsson et al., 2001], the\nintensity ratio I(5577)\/I(6300), which is an indicator of\nelectron energy [Gustavsson et al., 2002], is not presented\nhere. The artificial optical emissions centered on the MZ\ncontinued until \u000104:30 UT, which is well after HF reflection\nnominally ceased (\u000104:12 UT, label 5). At 04:30 UT, foF2 =\n2.55 MHz, 300 kHz below the pump frequency. Optical\nemissions with an irregular structure were produced after\n04:30 until \u000104:38 UT. At 04:38 UT, when the irregular\noptical emissions ceased, foF2 = 2.4 MHz, 450 kHz below\nthe pump frequency. Both these observations are consistent\nwith the studies of Kosch et al. [2005] and Pedersen et al.\n[2003]. Since the irregular structures do not necessarily\nappear centered in the pump beam, they do not show well\nin Figures 1c and 1d.\n[28] Figure 2 shows examples of 630 nm images of the\npump-induced artificial optical emissions from the HAARP\nall-sky imager, with time and the ionospheric critical\nfrequency overlaid. For all panels, north and east are to\nthe top and right, respectively. The optical emissions on the\nwestern and northeastern horizon are due to sunset and\nnatural aurora, respectively. The emission blob in the\nnorthwest is due to unrelated High-Power Auroral Stimula-\ntion (HIPAS) heater operations. The contours that corre-\nspond to percentage power of the HAARP beam are\noverlaid on Figures 2a and 2b. Figure 2a corresponds to\nwhen HF reflection and UH resonance were both possible.\nFigure 2b corresponds to UH resonance only being possible.\nFigure 2c shows an irregularly structured optical emission\nwhen UH resonance is close to ceasing. This image is\nsimilar to that of Kosch et al. [2005], who suggested that\nthe pump beam was illuminating a random large-scale\nregion in the ionosphere, dense enough to permit UH\nresonance. From a morphology point of view, Figures 2a\nand 2b are similar. The 630 nm optical emissions appear for\n>30% of maximum beam power, suggesting that \u00013 MW\nERP is the threshold for photon detection, consistent with\nthe result of Pedersen et al. [2003] (\u00012 MW ERP). The\ncentral bright optical blob has an angular width of \u00019\u0001\n[Kosch et al., 2007], consistent with Djuth et al. [2005]\n(\u00018\u0001) and Pedersen et al. [2003] (\u00017\u0001). Example of\n557.7 nm images appear in the work of Kosch et al. [2007].\n[29] Figure 1e shows the Kodiak radar backscatter power\nover HAARP for 8 MHz radar frequency. Clearly, back-\nscatter power increases during the O-mode pump pulses,\nas expected. There is no clear evidence of irregularity\nproduction during the X-mode pump pulses. Unfortunately,\nthe purity of the polarization could not be quantified\n(M. McCarrick, private communication). Hence O-mode\nleakage may account for the occasional apparent small\nFigure 2. Example of 630 nm images of pump-induced\nartificial optical emissions from the HAARP all-sky imager\nwith time and the ionospheric critical frequency overlaid.\nFor all panels, north and east are to the top and right,\nrespectively. The optical emissions on the western and\nnortheastern horizon are due to sunset and natural aurora,\nrespectively. The emission blob in the northwest is due to\nunrelated HIPAS heater operations. The spots correspond to\nstars. Figures 2a and 2b show percentage power contours\nfrom the HAARP beam.\nA06325 KOSCH ET AL.: SECOND GYROHARMONIC RESULTS AT HAARP\n6 of 13\nA06325\nincreases in backscatter power during X-mode transmis-\nsions, or these may be due to natural irregularities. The\nnonzero background of backscatter power is a common\nfeature at HAARP, resulting from natural plasma irregular-\nities especially around sunset [Djuth et al., 2005]. After\n\u000104:20 UT, the average backscatter power enhancements\ndecline, although pump-induced modulations are still clear-\nly visible up to \u000104:45 UT (label 7), consistent with the\noptical observations. Between \u000103:45 and \u000104:20 UT, the\namplitude of the artificial backscatter enhancements is\n\u000120\u201325 dB. For other times, this reduces to \u000110\u201315 dB.\nWe also note that prior to \u000103:45 UT (label 4), the\nbackscatter power data appear much noisier in character\nthan after this time. Data from the higher SuperDARN radar\nfrequencies are not shown, as they indicate the same results\nbut lose orthogonality earlier during the experiment, as\npredicted by ray tracing.\n[30] Figure 3 shows the intervals of the raypaths within 1\u0001\northogonality to the magnetic field line direction over\nHAARP for the Kodiak radar beam 9 as a function of\nrange, altitude, and frequency. The 6 Kodiak frequencies\nused are shown with different colors. HAARP\u2019s position is\ndenoted by the vertical line, which also corresponds to the\npoleward \u00073 dB edge of the tilted pump beam. Figures 3a,\n3b, 3c, and 3d show 03:16, 03:36, 03:56, and 04:16 UT,\nrespectively. The ray trace takes into account the iono-\nspheric tilt due to sunset by using ionosonde data from\nHAARP and King Salmon Island, which is near the Kodiak\nradar. It is obvious that F-region orthogonal backscatter\npersists the longest for the radar\u2019s lowest operating fre-\nquency. The general decline in radar backscatter power after\n\u000104:10 UT also coincides with orthogonality coming from\nan ever-decreasing altitude range, ultimately becoming\nimpossible. Orthogonal backscatter at 10 MHz ceases soon\nafter 03:36 UT (Figure 3b), which is just prior to the pump\nfrequency reaching the double resonance at \u000103:45 UT.\nAssuming similar ionospheric propagation conditions, this\nexplains why Kosch et al. [2005] were unsuccessful at\nobserving SuperDARN backscatter during the first pump\nfrequency pass through the second GH.\n[31] Figure 1f shows the MUIR radar backscatter power\nin the MZ over HAARP. These data as well as the power\nspectral density have been presented by Oyama et al.\n[2006], but we interpret them here in the light of the optical\nand SuperDARN radar data (Figures 1c, 1d, and 1e). Within\n\u000130 ms of pump on the backscatter, power increases during\nthe O-mode pump pulses, as expected for the PDIL mech-\nanism [cf. Isham et al., 1999]. There is no evidence of any\neffects during the X-mode pump pulses. The long transmit-\nter pulse used (\u00011 ms) makes locating the altitude of the\npump-induced backscatter echo difficult despite the receiver\nsampling at \u00011.5 km resolution. However, estimates (not\nshown) are consistent with the Digisonde data. Prior to the\ndouble resonance (\u000103:45 UT, label 4), the MUIR back-\nFigure 3.

This indicates probable slow\nplasma irregularity growth. After \u000103:45 UT (label 4), the\nMUIR backscatter is overshoot-like in character with only a\nbrief impulse at the beginning of each O-mode pump pulse.\nThis indicates strong striation growth associated with UH\nwaves, consistent with the increased amplitude SuperDARN\nradar backscatter (Figure 1e). The change from upshifted to\ndownshifted plasma-line observations at 03:39\u201303:41 UT\nmeans that one pump pulse is not observed. However, the\nphysics of the observations are not affected, being the same\nfor both up- and downshifted plasma-lines in the radar\ndata. The timing of this technical change is unfortunate as\nit occurs between the plasma and double resonances\n(Figure 1, labels 3 and 4).\n[32] Between \u000104:15 and 04:40 UT, the X-mode reflec-\ntion altitude approximately coincided with that for the second\nGH (Figure 1b, asterisk trace). No unambiguous evidence of\nany resonant effects were detected for the X-mode pump\npulses, as were suggested by Das and Fejer [1979]. Experi-\nments by one of us (M.J.K.) at EISCATalso produce negative\nresults for X-mode pumping. Hence for discussion purposes,\nthe HAARP pump cycle is effectively 1 min O-mode and\n3 min off.\n3. Discussion\n[33] The vertical dashed lines in Figure 1 indicate impor-\ntant times: \u000103:12\u201303:15 and \u000103:37 UT (labels 1\u20133)\nwhen the altitude of HF reflection (HO) coincided, or almost\ncoincided, with that of the local second gyroharmonic, i.e.,\nfP (HO)\b 2fC (HO) (plasma resonance), \u000103:45 UT (label 4)\nwhen HUHR = H2fCO (double resonance), \u000104:12 UT\n(label 5) when nominal HF reflection ceased, \u000104:34 UT\n(label 6) when the UH resonance (UHR) ceased, and\n\u000104:45 UT (label 7) when HF backscatter and artificial\noptical emissions ceased. The intensity of the O(1D) and\nO(1S) optical emissions, I(6300) and I(5577) respectively,\ntripled in theMZwhen plasma resonance was almost reached\nat \u000103:12 UT (label 1). After \u000103:15 UT (label 2), when\nthe plasma density temporarily increased so that fP (HO) <\n2fC (HO), both I(6300) and I(5577) decreased. When the\nplasma resonance was reached at \u000103:37 UT (label 3),\nboth I(6300) and I(5577) almost quadrupled, only reducing\nat \u000104:12 UT (label 5) when the steadily decreasing foF2\ndropped below the pump frequency fo = 2.85 MHz.\n[34] Figure 4 shows the frequency-height plots introduced\nby Mishin et al. [2005a]. The local UH resonance frequency\n( fUHR, circles), local plasma frequency ( fP, triangles), and\nlocal second gyroharmonic frequency (2fC, solid line) are\nshown as a function of height (H) as determined from\nionosonde profiles and the IGRF model. Comparing Figures\n1 and 4 shows that I(6300) decreased by \u000110 R (\u000130%)\nwhen foF2 decreased below 2fC(HfoF2) after \u000104:12 UT.\nAlso, prior to the cessation of the I(6300) emission, the line\n2fC(H) intersected the weakening fUHR(H) at \u000104:34 UT for\nthe last time. However, the pump-induced enhancements in\nthe HF radar backscatter power (Figure 1e) are clearly\nvisible up to \u000104:45 UT (label 7). These are associated\nwith the irregularly shaped optical emissions (see Figure 2).\n[35] The strong influence of the plasma resonance is in\nagreement with the 2004 results [Kosch et al., 2005; Mishin\net al., 2005a], where I(6300) doubled at the plasma reso-\nnance and when foF2 ! 2fC (HfoF2). This suggests that\nL waves participate in electron acceleration at altitudes\nabove HUHR, consistent with the MUIR radar observations\nof pump-enhanced L waves (Figure 1f). The larger values of\nthe relative optical gain and smaller ultimate intensities\nreported here, compared to 2004, are probably due to the\nshorter pump pulses used here (1 min versus 2.5 min in\n2004), emphasizing the importance of the initial modifica-\ntion phase within the pumped volume [e.g., Mishin et al.,\n2004].\n[36] The oscillating two-stream instability of L waves\n(OTSIL) mechanism produces Langmuir waves evolving\ninto strong Langmuir turbulence, which has a typical radar\nsignature, i.e., the central peak in the ion-line incoherent\nscatter spectrum [e.g., DuBois et al., 1993]. Unfortunately,\nsuch data are not available for our experiment. However, we\nexpect that the OTSIL mechanism was not active because\nthe strict frequency matching condition was not met because\nof pumping outside the Spitze cone, the low pump power\n(\u000111 MW ERP) used makes stimulating OTSIL unlikely,\nand no optical emissions were observed at the poleward\nedge of the pump beam which happens to be inside\nthe Spitze cone. Hence in the following discussion on\nLangmuir turbulence, we focus on the weak turbulence\nPDIL mechanism.\n[37] Since the zenith angle of the magnetic field (c) at\nHAARP is small (\u000115\u0001), a substantial component of the\npump wave electric field is parallel to the magnetic field\nin the region of downward reflection [Mishin et al.,\n2001]. Thus the generation of weak Langmuir turbulence\nby the pump wave for oblique incidence should be similar\nto that for the vertical incidence. For vertical incidence, a\nstanding wave is created near reflection, the so-called\nAiry pattern. Pumping in the MZ does not create an Airy\nFigure 4.

The solid lines indicate second gyroharmonic\nfrequency (2fC(H), diagonal), the pump frequency ( fO,\nvertical), and the height of the second gyroharmonic at the\npump frequency used (H2fCO, horizontal). Universal time\nfor the different profiles is given as hh:mm.\nA06325 KOSCH ET AL.: SECOND GYROHARMONIC RESULTS AT HAARP\n8 of 13\nA06325\npattern because of the oblique incidence, which causes the\nreflected wave to propagate away. Hence the effect of\ninhomogeneity, which increases the damping rate [e.g.,\nFejer, 1979], is insignificant in the MZ. We evaluate\nthe critical angle of incidence beyond which classical\nPDIL is not possible. The PDIL matching conditions are:\nwO \u2019 w2P\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1\u00fe 3k2Lr2D cos2 q\u00fe w2C=wP \n sin2 q\nq\n\u000b wIA and\nkL \u2019 kIA, where kL and kIA are the wave numbers of the\nLangmuir and ion-acoustic electrostatic waves, respectively,\nkLk = kL cos q =\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nk2L \u0007 k2L?\np\n, and rD \u0001 1 cm is the Debye\nradius (kL \u000b wO\/c is assumed). At the reflection altitude\n(HO), wP \u2019 wO cos c, where c is the magnetic zenith angle,\nand the first of the matching conditions for q ! 0 is\nfulfilled at kL \u2019 rD tan c\/\nffiffiffi\n3\np\n. Comparing the Landau\ndamping rate gL with the collisional rate ne\/2, one finds\nthat for a broad range of F-region plasma parameters, gL\n< ne\/2 so long as c < 17\u0001. Therefore the well-known\nfeatures of PDIL for vertical pump wave injections [e.g.,\nFejer, 1979] are also valid for MZ pump wave injections\natHAARP and EISCAT, where the magnetic zenith angles\nare \u000115\u0001 and \u000113\u0001, respectively, i.e., <17\u0001. This is\nconsistent with radar observations by Isham et al. [1999],\nDhillon and Robinson [2005],Ashrafi et al. [2007],Oyama et\nal. [2006], and the MUIR observations presented here. The\ncorollary to the above is that PDIL cannot be stimulated in the\nmagnetic zenith at lower latitude ionospheric pumping\nfacilities, i.e., for c > 17\u0001, because of increased Landau\ndamping.\n[38] Figure 1 shows no apparent change in the optical\nemission intensity during the double resonance crossing\n(\u000103:45 UT, label 4). At first glance, this suggests that\nwithin 1 min, the TPIUH (striations)-related processes did\nnot develop sufficiently to contribute to the electron heating\/\nacceleration process. However, the MUIR plasma-line over-\nshoot-like behavior after \u000103:45 UT indicates that PDIL\ndevelopment is quickly suppressed, most likely due to\nstriation-related anomalous absorption [e.g., Stubbe et al.,\n1994]. This is consistent with the pump-induced Super-\nDARN radar backscatter power enhancements almost\ndoubling in amplitude after \u000103:45 UT. Thus we conclude\nthat the TPIUH mechanism\u2019s contribution (UH waves) to\nthe optical emission intensity is comparable to that from the\nPDIL mechanism (L waves). However, we note that the\nI(6300) and I(5577) increases and decreases, respectively,\nafter \u000103:45 UT. This suggests that the energy spectrum of\nthe accelerated electrons is softening, contrary to the study\nof Kosch et al. [2005]. Unfortunately, this can not be\nchecked quantitatively with the present data set as the pump\npulses were too short to ensure that I(6300) reached the\nsteady state.\n[39] The dispersion equation, i.e., the dielectric permit-\ntivity (e?) = 0, for kk << k? and x = k2?r\n2\nC << 1 (rC \u2019 3 cm is\nthe gyroradius of the thermal electrons) [e.g., Ichimaru,\n1973] is:\ne? w; k\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc w\n2 \u0007 w2UHR\nw2 \u0007 w2C\n\u0007 3w\n2\nPw\n2\nCx\nw2 \u0007 w2C\n\u0004 \u0005\nw2 \u0007 4w2C\n\u0004 \u0005 \u00bc 0 \u00f01\u00de\nwhere w = 2pf.

In the immediate vicinity of\n2fC, i.e., d\n2\nUHR \u0012 916 x, one gets d1;2 x\u00f0 \u00de \u2019 dUHR2 \u0011 38\nffiffi\nx\np\n, while\nat 1\u000b d2UHR \u000b 916 x, the two frequencies are distinct, namely,\nd1 (x) \u2019 dUHR + 964 x\/dUHR and d2 (x) \u2019 \u0007 964 x\/dUHR [e.g.,\nGrach, 1979]. The UH and EB modes correspond to the\npositive and negative sign of @@x d, respectively.\n[40] Clearly, for fO = fUHR(HUHR) < 2fC(HUHR), or dO =\ndUHR < 0, only matching with EBmodes is possible, and thus\nTPIUH cannot develop [Mj\u00f8lhus, 1993]. Only when the\ndouble plasma resonance is reached (after \u000103:45 UT in\nour case) can UH modes exist, and therefore the TPIUH can\ngrow. This is in agreement with the increased amplitude in\npump-enhanced SuperDARN radar backscatter and MUIR\nradar backscatter switching from persistent to overshoot in\ncharacter at \u000103:45 UT (Figure 1, label 4). However, the\nquestion remains as to what the cause is for the Kodiak\nbackscatter enhancements prior to \u000103:45 UT, when only\nEB modes appear possible since the HF radar backscatter\ncomes from the striations, which are symbiotic with UH\nmodes only. This issue is addressed later.\n[41] The TPIUH threshold near the second GH strongly\ndepends on the frequency mismatch [Grach, 1979]:\nETPIUH \u2019 0:15\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nxin \u00fe k2kl2e \u00fe k2?r2C\n\u0006 \u0007 @ w2e?\u00f0 \u00de\nw@w\nr\nV\nm\n\t \n\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere xin \u0001 10\u00074 and le \u0001 0.5\u20131 km are the coefficient of\ninelastic losses and mean free path of thermal electrons,\nrespectively, and 1\/kk (1\/k?) is the longitudinal (transverse)\nextent of field-aligned density irregularities, k? \u000b kk. This\nimplies that kk \u000b kk* = jrk nej\/ne = 1\/Ln, where Ln\u0001 50 km\nis the F-region plasma density gradient scale.\n[42] The value of\n@ w2e?\u00f0 \u00de\nw@w is \u000b 20 for jdUHRj \u000b 34 k? rC\nand \b16\/3 for jdUHRj << 34 k? rC [Grach, 1979], so that one\nexpects TPIUH to develop only for jdUHRj < 34 k? rC. For the\noptimum transverse scale of striations am \u2019 fO2fC \u0007 1\n\u0006 \u0007\u00071\n4\nm\nto achieve the nonlinear explosive growth phase [Vaskov\nand Gurevich, 1977; Gurevich et al., 2002], the latter\ninequality translates into dUHR < d\n\u00f0m\u00de\nUHR \u2019 0.01 [Mishin et al.,\n2005a]. From analysis of the frequency-height profiles (see\nFigure 4), it follows that the latter holds until \u000104:34 UT\n(Figure 1, label 6), after which the growth rate of TPIUH\ndecreases because of the increasing threshold, correlating\nwith the decrease in the pump-induced SuperDARN radar\nbackscatter power around this time.\n[43] The free-space electric field of the injected pump wave\n(EO = 5.5\nffiffiffi\nP\np\n\/r) is \u000175 mV\/m at a distance of r \u2019 250 km\n[Mishin et al., 2005b]. For EO \u0001 75 mV\/m and\nx\u000b xin \u00fe k2kl2e , condition (2) reduces to EO > ETPIUH \u2019\n0.15\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n3\n16\nk2?r\n2\nC\nq\nand yields k? rC < 0.22, provided that\njdUHRj < 0.1. The long-scale perturbations, kkle << k?rC <\nx\u00071=2in \u0001 10\u00072, appear to have a low threshold value of\u000115 mV\/m, which is less than the injected pump electric\nfield. However, since these waves have kk << kk*, the\nbackground inhomogeneity hampers their development\n[e.g., Grach, 1979]. Figure 5 shows dispersion curves of\nthe UH mode waves at the F-layer peak during the latter part\nof the experiment, when fO > 2fC (HfoF2) \u0002 fUHR (HfoF2).\nAt 04:34, 04:45, 04:50, and 04:51 UT, the matching values\nA06325 KOSCH ET AL.: SECOND GYROHARMONIC RESULTS AT HAARP\n9 of 13\nA06325\nof k? rC were 0.028, 0.07, 0.09, and 0.1, respectively, and\nthe values of dUHR (HfoF2) were \u2019 \u00070.0025, \u00070.046,\n\u00070.065, and \u00070.09, respectively. Clearly, after 04:45 UT,\njdUHR (HfoF2)j > 34 k? rC, and thus the TPIUH could hardly\nbe excited. This coincides with the abrupt disappearance\nof the pump-enhanced SuperDARN radar backscatter\n(Figure 1e, label 7). This result is consistent with the\nprediction for orthogonal backscatter shown in Figure 3,\nsince the worsening conditions for F-region orthogonal\nbackscatter in a weakening ionosphere is a gradual process\nand is hardly responsible for such a sudden change. The\nsame is true for TPIUH, which is obviously possible beyond\nthe idealized cutoff time (\u000104:34 UT) predicted by the\nionosonde data (Figure 1b, label 6).\n[44] The threshold of the parametric decay PDIUH\/EB near\nthe second GH is [Mishin et al., 2005a]:\nEnPDI \u2019\n0:15\nTe eV\u00bd \u0016\nf 2O MHz\u00bd \u0016\n3\u0007DLH\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nDLH\nx\nmV\nm\n\t \ns\n\u00f03\u00de\nwhere D2LH \u00bc f 2LH=f 2LHR \u2019 1\u00fe Y 2 \u00fe 34\u00fe 3 TiTe\n\u0006 \u0007\nx, Y = m\u00071\/2\nkk\/k, fLHR = fCm1\/2 is the lower hybrid resonance (LHR)\nfrequency, and m \b 3 \n 10\u00075 is the electron-to-ion mass ratio\n[e.g., Ichimaru, 1973].

Clearly, for krC < 0.2, the collisionless damping is\nnegligible, and PDIUH\/EB should develop as described by\nMishin et al. [2005a]. Prior to the double-resonance cross-\ning at \u000103:45 UT, the most favorable conditions for PDIEB\ndevelopment above HUHR are achieved near the reflection\naltitude, where dUHR \u2019 0.1.

After the\ndouble-resonance crossing at \u000103:45 UT, fO = 2fC (HUHR) +\na \n fLHR, and PDIUH develops below HUHR at altitudes\nwhere dUHR < \u0007 0:25a\u00071 < 0. For Ln = 50 km, jdUHRj varies by\u00010.009\/km, and the latter condition implies a \u0002 2. Clearly,\nthe PDIEB-created EB modes are close to the cyclotron\nresonance.\n[47] Electron acceleration via cyclotron resonance\n\u0006k \u00bc wk\u00072wCkk enhances when wk ! 2wC. Acceleration of\nthe background suprathermal electron population (i.e., pho-\ntoelectrons) provides many more \u2018\u2018seed\u2019\u2019 electrons than are\navailable from the ionospheric thermal population [Mishin\nand Telegin, 1986; Grach, 1999; Mishin et al., 2004]. For\nsuprathermal electrons with\nm\u00062k\n2\n= 1 \u0007 10 eV and kk \u0001 2pfOc ,\nthe magnitude of the frequency mismatch Df = f(k) \u0007 2fC\nshould not exceed an upper limit of Df# \u2019 (0.3 \u0007 1)10\u00072 fO\n\u0001 10 \u0007 30 kHz or (1.2 \u0007 3.6)fLHR. At \u000104:14 UT, this limit\nwas exceeded for the F-layer peak, i.e., foF2 \u0007 2fC (HfoF2)\n\b \u000735 kHz. Note that this does not necessarily mean that\nelectron acceleration is no longer possible. Above the F-\nlayer peak, the longitudinal wave vectors kk of upward-\npropagating waves increases so that the cyclotron resonance\nis still possible. However, since the wave energy is reduced\nby collisional damping, the acceleration efficiency de-\ncreases; consistent with the I(5577) behavior (Figure 1d).\n[48] The solid diagonal line in Figure 1b gives the solar\nterminator altitude. It intersected with the reflection altitude\nafter \u000104:06 UT so that the photoelectrons at and below HO\nbecame available only via transport from above.

Clearly, for the low-\nenergy electrons, it is hard to make it to the acceleration\nregion at lower altitudes, and thus the contribution of the\nsuprathermal population to I(6300) should decrease. This is\nconsistent with the abrupt decrease in the red line intensity\nby \u000130% at \u000104:09 UT. On the other hand, \u000210 eV\nelectrons appear capable of reaching HO and even HUHR\n[e.g., Bernhardt et al., 1989] to participate in the pump-\ninduced acceleration process, contributing mainly to\nI(5577). This explains why I(5577) hardly varies, while\nI(6300) drops significantly at \u000104:09 UT.\n[49] The gradual variation in the artificial optical intensi-\nties during 03:40\u201304:10 UT is now addressed. The volume\nemission rate of I(6300), VER(6300), is mainly determined\nby the electron temperature altitude profile [e.g., Mantas\nand Carlson, 1996; Mishin et al., 2004]. VER(6300) is very\nsensitive to the energy distribution of the thermal electrons,\nwhich may deviate significantly from a Maxwellian distri-\nbution because of inelastic collisions with molecular nitro-\ngen (N2) [Mishin et al., 2000]. For a given plasma density\nne, this deviation decreases with altitude as the N2 density\ndecreases, likewise the collisional deactivation of the O(1D)\nstate. Both effects provide for an increasing VER(Te) during\nthe course of twilight observations [Mishin et al., 2000,\n2004]. Thus following HfoF2, I(6300) is expected to rise\nwhen HO approaches HfoF2 or foF2! fP (HO). On the other\nhand, the O(1S) emission is dominated by suprathermal\nelectrons and increases for lower altitudes. Therefore\nI(5577) is expected to decrease when foF2 approaches\nfP(HO). Both these conjectures agree well with the data\n(Figures 1c and 1d) [cf. Mishin et al., 2005b].\n[50] Assuming that we always approach important fre-\nquency boundaries from below, we have established that\nprior to plasma resonance at \u000103:37 UT (Figure 1, label 3),\nthe PDIL and PDIEB mechanisms were operational, and this\nprobably continued until double resonance at \u000103:45 UT\n(Figure 1, label 4) but with increased efficiency. Unfortu-\nnately, the limited data set between plasma and double\nresonance, coupled to Digisonde and MUIR radar data\ngaps, makes for some uncertainty in this small interval.\nAfter double resonance and prior to the cessation of nominal\nHF reflection at \u000104:12 UT (Figure 1, label 5), the TPIUH\nand PDIUH mechanisms were operational, with PDIL being\nonly present at the start of the pump pulse because of the\ngrowth of striations. After the cessation of HF reflection,\ni.e., an underdense ionosphere, the TPIUH and PDIUH\nmechanisms were operational without the presence of PDIL.\n[51] The presence of pump-induced HF radar backscatter\n(Figure 1e) after double resonance (\u000103:45 UT, label 4) is\neasily understood since the TPIUH mechanism is symbiotic\nwith meter-scale plasma irregularities (striations), which\nresult in backscatter if the orthogonality condition is met\n(Figure 3). However, prior to double resonance, when only\nPDIL and PDIEB were present, the SuperDARN radar also\nobserved pump-induced backscatter enhancements. PDIL is\nEMO ! L + IA, producing waves near parallel to the\nmagnetic field directions to which the side-viewing HF\nradar is insensitive. PDIEB is EMO ! EB + LH. EB waves\nwould be trapped by field-aligned plasma enhancements.\nIstomin and Leyser [1997] pointed out that increasing\nelectron temperature in a region of short transverse scale\n(l? < 3 m) leads to electron motion into this region, so that\nthe plasma density increases, unlike for l? > 3 m. This may\nestablish a positive feedback loop between EB wave heating\nand plasma enhancements, leading to an instability [Huang\net al., 1995], just like UH wave heating and striations.\nHowever, short transverse scales are not favorable for\n8 MHz backscatter, the Bragg scatter condition is l? \b\n19 m. Ionospheric topside rocket measurements found\nnatural LH wave-density depletions with a transverse scale\nsize of l? \b 20 m [Vago et al., 1992], almost exactly that\nrequired for HF backscatter. LH wave density cavitons\ngenerated via EB + LH ! EM can undergo collapse\n[Musher et al., 1978; Mishin et al., 2004], which results in\nelectron acceleration and hence artificial optical emissions.\nHence we conclude that the SuperDARN HF radar back-\nscatter is the result of pump-induced LH wave density\ncavitons. This is the first identification of SuperDARN radar\nbackscatter from cavitons associated with LH waves.\n[52] Djuth et al. [2005] published SEE spectra for iono-\nspheric pumping below the second GH, showing the DM\nfeature. However, for the pump-frequency regime used,\nonly EB and LH plasma waves could have been present.\nThis excludes the TPIUH mechanism, meaning that the UH\nwave-associated striations were not present, which are an\nessential feature for producing the SEE [Carozzi et al.,\n2002]. We have already shown that density enhancements\nassociated with EB waves are unlikely. Hence it seems\nlikely that the density depletions necessary for generating\nSEE are produced by the LH cavitons, i.e., the field-\naligned density cavity is created by the LH wave ponder-\nomotive force. In this scenario, the SEE spectra by Djuth et\nal. [2005] are entirely consistent with the SuperDARN\nradar observations of LH cavitons, reported here for the\nfirst time.\n4. Conclusion\n[53] During an ionospheric pumping experiment at\nHAARP, a frequency pass from below to above the second\nelectron gyroharmonic was executed. Simultaneous HF and\nUHF radar observations and multiwavelength optical obser-\nvations were performed. These observations are consistent\nwith the coexistence of the parametric decay and thermal\nparametric instabilities just above the second gyroharmonic.\nTwo, sometimes three, mechanisms operate simultaneously\nFigure 7.

Hence parametric decay into Langmuir and ion-\nacoustic waves is possible while pumping into the magnetic\nzenith at high-latitude sites such as HAARP and EISCAT.\n[55] Pump wave parametric decay into electron Bernstein\n(upper-hybrid) and lower-hybrid plasma waves occurs for\npump frequencies below (above) the second gyroharmonic\nonly. The thermal parametric instability, which produces\nupper-hybrid waves on plasma irregularities, only operates\nabove the second gyroharmonic frequency and accounts for\nthe observed HF radar backscatter asymmetry. The fact\nthat upper-hybrid waves and striations are impossible for\npump frequencies below the second gyroharmonic, and the\nimprobability of electron-Bernstein wave trapping in plasma\nenhancements of a transverse scale size necessary to meet the\nradar backscatter Bragg condition, means that the Super-\nDARN radar centerline observations of enhanced backscatter\nin this regime are due to lower-hybrid wave cavitons. This is\nthe first time such radar observations, associated with pump-\nenhanced lower-hybrid waves in the ionosphere, have been\nidentified and reported.\n[56] Two areas for further investigation are the accele-\nrated electron energy spectrum, which may be different for\ndifferent frequency regimes about the second gyroharmonic,\nand details of what happens between the closely spaced\nplasma and double-resonance frequencies.\n[57] Acknowledgments.
