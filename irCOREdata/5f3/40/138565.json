Discussions have included both mitigation\nmeasures and methods of internalisation of these environmental costs (or the principle\nof polluter pays).\nThis paper focuses on engine emissions, which have both local and climate change\nimplications, and where the emphasis of most recent discussions has centred. This has\ntaken place at an international, regional and local level: The standing Committee on\nAviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) of the International Civil Aviation\nOrganisation (ICAO) has been asked to investigate proposals for emissions trading, in\naddition to ICAO\u2019s role in setting international standards for engine emissions.\nAt the regional level, the European Commission is studying the possibility of\nincorporating emissions trading into their existing Emissions Trading System (ETS)\nfrom 2012 (European Commission, 1999, and subsequent press releases). They are also\nlikely to introduce a directive that sets limits of local air quality that would also affect\nlocal emission levels around airports. Thus in Europe, aviation is likely before too long\nto be required to control or pay for both its local and climate change impacts of aircraft\nengine emissions. Up to now this has only been subject to longer term changes through\nincreasingly stringent ICAO standards applied to new aircraft engines, and airport\nemissions charges at a few EU airports.\n- 3 -\nThe pollutants considered as the main ones emitted from aircraft movements\n(Woodmansey and Patterson, 1994) are CO2, PM, SO2, NOx and HC. The first, CO2,\nhas lower unit social cost than the others, but the total amount emitted is far larger\n(especially for the cruise part of the flight). Social costs are defined as the damage to\nhuman health, vegetation, buildings and climate change. Their valuation is discussed in\nMayeres et al (1996) and Perl et al (1997). The other pollutants account for a lower\nweight of emissions but have higher unit social costs. CO2 is estimated to have the\nlongest life (50 to 100 years) followed by methane (8-10 years), with NOx lasting only\na number of days or weeks. However, the global warming impact from aviation is\ncompounded by the emissions of NOx and water vapour in the upper atmosphere, the\nlatter sometimes leading contrails and cirrus cloud formation (these effects are\nsummarised in Annex 2 of European Commission, 2005). This is difficult to deal with\nthrough an ETS and it is intended to address it through other measures, one of which\n(standards) is discussed below.\nEurope is the region of the world with the greatest pressure to reduce emissions, and it\nis also the region where almost all of the countries have ratified the Kyoto Convention.\nThe EU has also pushed for the inclusion of environmental impacts in the EU\/US\naviation bilateral agreement. Growing concern is also evident in other world regions,\nreflected in the work programme of ICAO referred to above.\nThe first section of this paper will discuss Kyoto and the context for emissions trading,\nand the efforts at an international and regional level to reduce aircraft engine emissions.\nThis will be followed by a look at the various voluntary measures (targets) initiated by\n- 4 -\nthe industry. The fact that such progress is too slow (see ECAC, 2005) leads to the need\nfor imposing incentives, which can be addressed emphasising emissions trading.\n2 Means of engine emissions reduction\n2.1 Regulatory standards\nRegulatory initiatives have been taken in order to limit both local health impacts of\nemissions and climate change gases. The first covers a number of gases and is more\nrelevant to airports, with air transport treated in the same way as other industries. The\nsecond is focused on CO2 and NOx, and the cruise mode of operations, with air transport\ngenerally thought to have a greater impact on climate change than suggested by its\noutput of these gases.\nIt is more appropriate to introduce local measures to reduce LTO emissions; however,\nthe greenhouse gas element of these are also relevant to the climate change gas\nstabilisation that is incorporated in the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change (UNFCCC) and subsequent Kyoto Protocol. Article 2.2 requires the\nparties to work towards the limitation in emissions through ICAO, without laying down\nany timescale (IATA, 2001).\nUp to this point, ICAO\u2019s involvement in this field had been the encouragement of\nimproved emissions of new aircraft engines. Aircraft are required to meet the engine\ncertification standards adopted by the Council of ICAO. These are contained in Annex\n16 - Environmental Protection, Volume II - Aircraft Engine Emissions to the\n- 5 -\nConvention on International Civil Aviation. These were originally designed to respond\nto concerns regarding air quality in the vicinity of airports. As a consequence, they\nestablish limits for emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide, unburned\nhydrocarbons, for a reference landing and take-off (LTO) cycle below 915 metres of\naltitude (3 000 ft). There are also provisions regarding smoke and vented fuel.\n2.2 Trends and targets\nAirlines and their associations have set themselves targets for increased fuel efficiency,\nwhich provide proxies for CO2 efficiency gains. The International Air Transport\nAssociation (IATA) adopted a goal of achieving a 26% improvement overall between\n1990 and 2012 in litres per 100 Revenue tonne-kms or RTKs (IATA, 2005). This was\nnot especially onerous, since airlines such as British Airways had already achieved a\n20% improvement by 2000.\nBritish Airways has a target of a 30% improvement in fuel efficiency between 1990 and\n2010 (British Airways, 2004). The metric they use is RTKs per gallon, and they are\nclose to achieving this goal with their 2005 level 27% below the 1990 level (British\nAirways, 2006).\nThe first aviation and environment summit convened by the major international air\ntransport airline and airport trade associations highlighted the 70% improvement in fuel\nefficiency over the past 40 years (ATAG et al, 2005). This study compared today\u2019s\nmodern aircraft with fuel consumption of 3.5 litres per 100 passenger-km with similar\nconsumption for a modern compact car. They concluded with a shorter term target of 4\n- 6 -\nlitres per 100 passenger-km in 2008, versus an average of 4.5 in 2002. This is an\naverage annual reduction of 1.9%, significantly higher than recent trends, and\nachievable through the implementation of improved operational practices.\nIn the longer term, fuel efficiency (and thus CO2 efficiency) improvements have been\npossible of little more than 1% a year, and this is expected to slow in the future (see\nTable 9-2 in IPCC, 1999). With traffic forecast to grow by 4-5% a year, emissions are\nclearly set to increase significantly unless further measures can be introduced.\nEmissions trading provides the means to do this most economically, without resorting to\nphysical controls.\nThere is a range of existing technologies now available to reduce fuel burn considerably\nfaster than the more recent trend. Green (2005) describe the technologies available for\nreducing fuel burn and NOx, as well as contrails. For fuel burn, they range from the\noperational improvements identified in ICAO of 8% to the laminar flying wing with\nopen rotor propulsion that would produce an almost 70% reduction in fuel burn per\ntonne-km.\nOver the past 20-30 years there has been some economic incentive to apply new\ntechnologies from intermittent spikes in jet kerosene prices. Airlines may be entering a\nperiod of high fuel prices of longer duration, which would by itself give an incentive to\ntechnical innovation. This would have a beneficial impact on fuel burn and CO2, but\npossibly adverse affect on NOx.\n- 7 -\nACARE introduced a target of a 50% reduction in CO2 emission per tonne-km for an\naircraft entering production in 2020 relative to its year 2000 equivalent (Green, 2003).\nFor NOx a target of 80% was specified over the same period (ACARE, 2002).\n3 Emissions trading and air transport\nEmissions trading schemes are becoming more widespread with the EU ETS started in\n2005 and a similar scheme (RGGI) for seven states in the northeast of the US, capping\nCO2 emissions at their 1990 level. Voluntary schemes have been launched domestically\nin the UK (British Airways participate) and Japan.\nIntroducing an aircraft engine emissions trading scheme has been studied and discussed\nsince the 1990s, both at the world and regional level. Considerable analysis has been\napplied to an international scheme by ICAO\u2019s CAEP mentioned above. The reluctance\nof the US to be involved and other problems has meant that actually introducing such a\nscheme is unlikely for the foreseeable future, at least at a world level.\nIn Europe, the focus switched from a preference for emissions charges and taxes\n(European Commission, 1999) to emissions trading as the best way forward. A\nEuropean scheme is now very likely to become reality for air transport in 2011\/2012.\nThe European Commission published a study on economic incentives to mitigate\ngreenhouse gas emissions from air transport in 2002 (CE Delft, 2002). Their analysis\nwas limited to two policy options: an environmental charge and a Performance Standard\n- 8 -\nIncentive (PSI). The latter was based on emissions per unit of output, but did not\naddress the allocation of permits or trading.\nThe most effective way of meeting the policy objectives are:\n\uf0b7 Emissions trading\n\uf0b7 Emissions charges\nBoth the above are economic instruments that would lead to the internalisation of the\ncost of climate change. Each could, in principle, be designed to achieve the same level\nof emissions reduction. (European Commission, 2005).\n4 The EU ETS scheme\nGiven the problems in introducing an emissions tax on a regional basis, the EU member\ncountries are generally keen to see aviation brought into the EU ETS which so far has\nbeen introduced for a number of other industries. ICAO has been considering aviation\nemissions trading schemes, and encourages such regional initiatives, given the\nimpossibility of introducing it worldwide at the present time.\nA study by CE Delft (2005) for the European Commission examined concepts for\namending Directive 2003\/87\/EC to address the full climate change impact of aviation\nthrough emissions trading. This required the consultants to propose options in terms of\nthe scope of an EU scheme, the allocation and surrendering of allowances, and data\nrequirements. They also looked at the impact of these options, including any possible\ndistortions to competition.\n- 9 -\nThe study concluded that aircraft operators would be the best entity upon which to base\nthe system, with allocation at the EU, rather than individual member state level. It also\ncame out in favour of including only CO2, at least initially. It looked at the possibility\nof restricting the scope to intra-EU flights, as well as including all flights to\/from EU\nairports.\nAs to the allowance allocation method, the study reported that \u2018auctioning appears to be\nthe most attractive option for allocation\u2019. Their second-best option was benchmarking,\nand the least attractive was grandfathering, although this could be combined with the\nother methods..\nThe study evaluated the impact of the various options on short-haul, medium haul and\nlong-haul flights, but did not measure the impact on the different airline business\nmodels. This paper attempts to do this, building on some of the assumptions considered\nin the Delft study.\nThis paper also seeks to re-assess some of the Delft study\u2019s statements on distortion.\nThey stated in their executive summary that \u2018...any carrier operating between eg Paris\nand Copenhagen will be subject to exactly the same competitive conditions\u2019. This is\ntrue for origin-destination passengers, but one carrier (e.g. Air France) may feed a high\nproportion of the passengers on this sector to long-haul flights, while another (e.g.\neasyJet) might have no long-haul feed.\n- 10 -\nFurthermore, Air France (in the above example) will have to find or purchase allowance\nfor its Copenhagen-Paris-Houston traffic, while Continental could fly the same\npassenger non-stop via Newark with no environmental accountability.\nFrontier Economics (2006) is the only detailed airline response so far to the European\nCommission\u2019s study. It agreed with the possibility of airlines having allowance\nsubmission responsibility, but also proposed that airports are considered as an\nalternative, without going into detail. As with slots, airports may not be best placed to\nencourage the most efficient system. They supported the use of fuel burn as the unit of\ncharge, but came out strongly for a wider scope than just intra-EU flights.\nIn fact, they estimate that intra-EU coverage would capture just 42 million tonnes of\nCO2, compared to a total of 213 million for all flights departing and arriving at EU\nairports. CE Delft (2005) reported the somewhat different 52 million tonnes intra-EU\ncompared to 162 million tonnes in total based on 2004 Eurocontrol data.\n5 Analysis of three airline business models\nThe three business models selected for analysis are a network carrier, charter or leisure\nairline and a Low Cost Carrier (LCC). These were all from one country, UK, both to\nreduce possible distortions and because of greater data availability. The airlines are:\n\uf0b7 British Airways (Network carrier)\n\uf0b7 easyJet (Low Cost Carrier)\n\uf0b7 Britannia\/Thomsonfly (Charter\/leisure airline)\n- 11 -\nThese three provide some variation in operational characteristics such as average sector\nlength, passenger load factor and the share of RTKs on intra-EU routes.\n5.1 Operational characteristics\nTable 1 below gives the main traffic and operating data for the three UK airlines\nselected for the analysis. The key difference between the models are evident: the higher\nload factors for the LCC and charter models, and their higher density seating. The\ncharter airline uses larger aircraft, some of which are employed outside Europe.\nWhereas almost all easyJet\u2019s RTKs were within the European Economic Area (EEA),\nBritannia\/Thomsonfly operates longer haul charters to the Caribbean, Mexico, Egypt\nand Asia. British Airways carries the major part of its RTKs on routes to\/fom non-EEA\ncountries (although its also carried some traffic on its short-haul subsidiaries, not\nincluded in this analysis).\nInsert Table 1 here\nAny ETS scheme focused entirely on intra-EEA or EU flights\/traffic would clearly\nimpose a relatively larger burden on easyJet. It could also hasten the trend by charter\nairlines to move into longer haul leisure flights, and increase the medium haul focus for\nall airlines to North Africa and non-EU Eastern Europe.\n5.2 Fleets and fuel burn\n- 12 -\nBritish Airways\u2019 short\/medium haul fleet consists of a mixture of A319\/320 and B737\naircraft. The latter comprise three different variants, but two engine types. easyJet\noperate the B737-700 and B737-300 types, and are replacing the latter with A319s of\nthe same capacity. Britannia\/Thomsonfly mainly used its B757-200s on European\nsectors, with some B767s at peak times. However, with the birth of Thomsonfly, B737-\n500s and A320s have been introduced into the fleet.\nInsert Figure 1 here\nBritish Airways is a little below the industry average fuel efficiency in both passenger\nand seat terms. easyJet perform much better, due both to more seats per aircraft and a\nhigher average passenger load factor (Figure 1). Britannia\/Thomsonfly also has high\nseat density, and even higher load factors, in addition to operating larger aircraft types.\n6 Methodology for the analysis of three allocation methods\n6.1 Introduction\nThe method of allocation of ETS allowances is crucial in terms of the scheme\u2019s impact\non various players. It is assumed here that the relevant entity has been selected to be the\nairline. There are three main methods:\n\uf0b7 Grandfathering allowances\n\uf0b7 Auctioning allowances\n- 13 -\n\uf0b7 Benchmarking\nA combination of the first and last has also been proposed (Sentance & Pulles, 2005),\nand also the first and second (Hewett and Foley, 2000, and Butzengeiger et al, 2001).\n6.2 Grandfathering\nGrandfathering involves allocating free allowances based on past emissions. Each year,\nonce these were used up airlines would be required to purchase allowance from other\nairlines or other trading entities. It is intended that the other entities would be those\nalready in the EU ETS, and including these is crucial in obtaining the benefits of\nlimiting CO2 at least cost. The allocation could be by negotiation or by applying a\nformula, with the latter preferred because of lower transaction costs (Butzengeiger et al,\n2001).\nGrandfathering tends to reinforce the status quo, and reward the more polluting airlines\nwith pollution allowance that they do not have to pay for. Any further expansion could\nonly be obtained by more environmentally efficient aircraft, or the purchase of the\nnecessary allocation from others at the market price.\nA key question is setting the baseline for past emissions and thus allocation. The\nexisting ETS scheme used an average of the past three years. A five year average is\nalso possible, but that includes the sharp post-9\/11 downturn. An average of three or\nfive years historical data would put the LCCs at a serious disadvantage, since they have\n- 14 -\ngrown by more than 30% a year since then. New entrants would have to purchase all\ntheir allowances.\nAccording to Wang (2005), The UK allocation plan for the EU ETS used an average of\nemissions for 1998 to 2003 for the baseline. This was considered unacceptable by this\nstudy\u2019s case study airline, Britannia, because of the inclusion of the heavily 9\/11\ndistorted years 2001 and 2002. For the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (that started\nearlier) 1998-2000 was chosen as the baseline. British Airways reported exceeding\ntheir commitment to reducing emissions by 19% compared to this baseline (Sentance\nand Kershaw, 2005).\n6.3 Auctioning\nAuctioning allowances would be undertaken by the administering authority. In the EU\ncontext this could be the European Commission. Airlines would need to bid for the\nCO2 emissions that they would expect to need for the coming year or season. This is a\nfair method, especially between incumbents and new entrants, and faster and slower\ngrowing airlines. Auctioning can be combined with grandfathering. The major\nquestion with auctioning is how to apply the proceeds from the auctions. The money\nraised should be spent on CO2 reducing projects, but could also be used as general tax\nrevenue, or returned to airlines in proportion to traffic or through aviation related\nprojects.\n- 15 -\n6.4 Benchmarking\nBenchmarking has the advantage of rewarding airlines that have already introduced\nefficient aircraft, and those that achieve higher efficiency than their competitors. It is\nthus favoured by airlines that have high passenger load factors, eg LCCs (Frontier\nEconomics, 2006).\nBenchmarking involves the determination of a baseline efficiency measure, say RTKs\nper tonne CO2, fixing an overall CO2 cap, and allocating CO2 allowances depending on\nan airline\u2019s share of RTKs. This is the most likely EU aviation ETS approach:\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\nn\ni\nitotal RTKRTK\n1\n(1)\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\nn\ni\nitotal EE\n1\n(2)\ni\ntotal\ntotal\ni RTK\nRTK\nE\nA *\n)(\uf03d (3)\nn = number of airlines taking part\nRTKtotal = Total RTKs in the base period for those taking part\nRTKi = Total RTKs assigned to airline i in the base period\nEtotal = Emissions assigned to all airlines in the base period\nEi = Emissions assigned to airline i in the base period\nAi = Emission allowances assigned to each airline\n- 16 -\nFirst, this method puts a smaller burden on those airlines operating with high load\nfactors and over longer sectors. Second, those airlines flying shorter sectors would tend\nto be penalised, although Sentance and Pulles (2005) argue that this would encourage\npassengers to take less polluting forms of transport such as rail.\nThe above criticisms are addressed by using aircraft kms and flights as the efficiency\nmeasures, and not RPKs. This gets closer to penalising higher emitters, removing any\nreference to passenger loads as being irrelevant.\n\uf0e5\uf0e5\n\uf03d\uf03d\n\uf03d\np\nj\nkmij\nn\ni\nkm EE\n1\n)(\n1\n(4)\n\uf0e5\uf0e5\n\uf03d\uf03d\n\uf03d\np\nj\nflightsij\nn\ni\nflights EE\n1\n)(\n1\n(5)\ni\ntotal\nflights\nflightsi F\nF\nE\nA *\n)(\n)( \uf03d (6)\ni\ntotal\nkm\nkmi D\nD\nE\nA *\n)(\n)( \uf03d (7)\nAi = Ai(km) + Ai(flights) (8)\nn = number of airlines taking part\np = number of aircraft\/engine combinations\nEi(km) = Emissions assigned to airline i in the base period based on kilometres and\naircraft type (j) flown\n- 17 -\nEi(flight) = Emissions assigned to airline i in the base period based on number of flights\n(LTO) and aircraft type (j) flown\nEkm = Emissions assigned to all airlines in the base period based on kilometres and\naircraft types flown\nEflight = Emissions assigned to all airlines in the base period based on flights and\naircraft types flown\nAi(km) = Emission allowances assigned to each airline based on aircraft km performed\nAi(flight) = Emission allowances assigned to each airline based on number of flights\n(LTOs)\nAi = Total emission allowances assigned to each airline\nFi = Total flights performed by airline i for all EEU fleet\nDi = Total departures (LTOs) by airline i for all EEA fleet\nThe impact of each of the above benchmarking approaches will be analysed in the next\nsection.\n7 Results\n7.1 Grandfathering\nThe impact of 100% grandfathering was evaluated for the three types of UK airline\n(described in Section 5). British Airways has been growing slowly in RTK terms over\nthe past three years (+4% pa) and also over the past five years (+3% pa). There would\nthus not be a large difference between a three or five year average. They would also not\n- 18 -\nhave to purchase too much extra allowance over the next few years, given their paucity\nof firm aircraft orders and deliveries.\nA previous study (Wright, 2004) applied the UK National Allocation Plan approach to\nthree EU network carriers, British Airways, KLM and SAS, taking their latest actual\nyear of 2002. They found that, using the average of the four highest years between\n1998 and 2002, British Airways\u2019 allocation would be 12% above their 2002 actual\nemissions, KLM\u2019s 3% above, and SAS\u2019s 17% below. However, their intra-EU\nemissions were estimated using revenue shares. This is likely to have significantly\nexaggerated the EU share of emissions for these airlines.\nBritannia is owned by the pan-European tour group, TUI, and has recently set up its\nown LCC, Thomsonfly. Some of its aircraft have been transferred to this subsidiary,\nsuch that its overall growth has also not been large.\nThe third airline, easyJet, grew by around 30% last year, but this growth is now slowing\nto 15%. However, even at this rate they would still need to purchase significant\nquantity of allowance, and the average period is also of vital interest to such an airline.\nTable 2 below shows an allocation based on the average of 2003 and 2004 CO2\nemissions, in order not to penalise fast growing LCCs. The 2005 estimates were based\non 4% increase in total fuel burn for British Airways, 30% for easyJet and 10% for\nBritannia\/Thomsonfly (based on its faster growing LCC arm). For 2006, the projected\nchanges were 4%, 15% and 10% respectively. These growth rates did not explicitly\ntake into account fleet changes and the likely improvement in fuel efficiency (eg\n- 19 -\neasyJet) or deterioration (eg a greater share of operations for Thomsonfly with smaller\naircraft).\nInsert Table 2 here\nThe analysis shows that the LCC would need to purchase the most extra allowance in\nthe market, and at US$40 per tonne CO2 this would impose an extra charge for 2006 of\n$2.17 per passenger (or a reduction in profitability of $62 m). The initial premium on\nthe average fare would only be around 3% for easyJet and much lower for the other two\nairlines. At $100 per tonne the LCC cost would rise to $7.33.\n7.2 Auctioning\nThe analysis in Table 3 is based on the traffic growth rates and fuel burn shown in Table\n2. This option assumes that all the required CO2 emissions will need to be purchased in\nthe open market at $40 per tonne. This is somewhat higher than the market levels that\nwere reached from the existing EU scheme. In support, pressure from higher prices is\nlikely to come from a tightening of the existing scheme, and the fact that aviation, as a\nnet purchase of allowances, would be able to trade with participants from other\nindustries. A closed airline trading system was not considered.\nInsert Table 3 here\nThe above estimate works out as a $5.87 per passenger premium for easyJet, or 9% of\nthe average fare, assuming all of the cost is passed on to the passenger. At $100 per\ntonne the extra cost would rise to $14.68 per passenger. The total cost would be too\n- 20 -\nlarge to absorb in profits. On the other hand, British Airways\u2019 average European fare\nwas around US$260 in 2004\/05, such that the extra $4.18 would only amount to about\n1.6%. It could also be covered by network revenues.\n7.3 Benchmarking\nThe benchmarking formulae in 6.3 (Equation 3) above have been applied to the three\nairlines, assuming that the scheme is restricted to UK airlines and EEA operations. It\nhas also been restricted to passengers, with air cargo excluded. This type of traffic is\nmuch less significant on intra-EEA routes than long-haul operations. The total\nemissions that would need to be purchased in the market would be the actual emissions\nby all airlines for that year less Etotal.\nThe example in Table 4 below assumes that the target or baseline is set at total UK EEA\npassenger kms in 2003. Other targets would also be possible, but a more recent year\npenalises LCCs less, and could always be tightened later.\nInsert Table 4 here\nThe cost of the excess allowance needed in 2005 and 2006 is again based on a market\nprice of $40 per tonne, and the growth rates previously adopted. Britannia\/Thomsonfly\nis in credit on this allocation basis, because of its high efficiency relative to the\nbenchmark. This is through a combination of higher loads per flight and longer sectors.\nThe LCC is still penalised most, but, at least initially, not far off the burden on the\nnetwork carrier.\n- 21 -\nIn order to address the problems associated with the first benchmarking approach\n(discussed above), the more complex Equation 8 was applied to the three airlines, also\nusing the base year data. These results are shown in Table 5.\nInsert Table 5 here\nIt can be seen that Britannia\/Thomsonfly no longer performs as well against the new\nbenchmarks and thus receives insufficient allowance, resulting in a need in 2006 to\nspend $17 million on purchasing extra in the market. This would not be an excessive\namount relative to its average fare or profitability. British Airways is not penalised for\nflying smaller aircraft and more premium passengers and thus is allocated more\nallowance than it is expected to need. However, it is the flights and LTOs that cause the\nemissions and not the passengers, and it would seem unfair to allocate less to an airline\nthat carried a greater percentage of premium passengers (as in the first benchmarking\nmethod). Long-haul economy class passengers on intra-EU feeder sectors may also\nhave paid a high total fare and could easily absorb such increases.\n8 Summary and conclusions\nA number of previous studies have examined the possible impact of various ways of\nimplementing a European ETS. These have highlighted possible distortions, without\ninvestigation the impact on specific airlines (apart from the limited Wright, 2004,\nanalysis) or business models. This paper attempts to do this for three UK airlines: the\nnetwork carrier, British Airways, a major European LCC, easyJet, and one of the largest\n- 22 -\ncharter\/leisure airlines, Britannia\/Thomsonfly (itself part of a pan-EU group). It is\nargued that this gives a good indication of the relative impact on the business models,\nalthough a broader sample would be needed to be able to form any robust conclusions\non the specific impacts.\nThe above analysis assumes that an EU ETS for aviation would be only applied to intra-\nEU flights. This raises significant distortions by itself, but appears at present the most\nlikely approach. The focus has been on the three major types of allocation system:\ngrandfathering\/baseline, auctioning and benchmarking.\nThe analysis has been based on recent data for each of the airlines (2003 and 2004). To\nexamine the impact over 2005 and 2006, traffic growth rates have assumed to be 4% for\nBritish Airways for each year, 30% and 15% for easyJet and 10% for\nBritannia\/Thomsonfly for both years. Cargo has been excluded on the basis of the\nminimum distortion it might cause for shorter haul routes.\nThe summary in Figure 2 shows that, as expected, the impact is greater on the LCC in\nall cases, although not by too much. This would be worse if the baseline had been\nbased on less recent emissions. Thus the cap is lenient, the main purpose being to give\nan incentive to airlines (or other industries) to reduce pollution in the future. The\nposition of Britannia depends to a large extent on how far its LCC (Thomsonfly) grows\nrelative to its tour operator\/leisure flights.\nInsert Figure 2 here\n- 23 -\nThe baseline or grandfathering approach tends to penalise the faster growing LCC and\nfavour the network carrier. The latter carries both long- and short-haul passengers on its\nintra-EU feeder services, and the cost could easily be absorbed in the total long-haul\nticket price. It would, however, put the EU network carrier at a small disadvantage\nrelative to foreign hub carriers in the same markets.\nAuctioning (favoured by the CE Delft, 2005, study) is the most costly option for\nairlines, and needs further evaluation in terms of how the proceeds are used, and hybrid\nschemes. Benchmarking is the second choice of the CE Delft (2005) study and a\npossible approach has been discussed in ICAO\u2019s CAEP. An alternative is proposed\nhere of splitting the benchmark into a LTO and distance flown elements. This is more\ncomplex in terms of data collection and monitoring, but avoids the sector length\ndistortion and does not penalise low emissions smaller aircraft.\n- 24 -\nReferences\nACARE, 2002.
