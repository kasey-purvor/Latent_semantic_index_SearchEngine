Recent investigations of some self-exciting Faraday-disk homopolar dynamos [Hide, R. and Moroz, I. M., Physica\nD 134, 1999, 387\u2013301; Moroz, I. M. and Hide, R., International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos 2000, 2701\u20132716; Moroz, I.\nM., International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos 13, 2003, 147\u2013161; Moroz, I. M., International Journal of Bifurcation and\nChaos, to appear] have yielded the classic Lorenz equations as a special limit when one of the principal bifurcation parameters is\nzero. In this paper we focus upon one of those models [Moroz, I. M., International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos 13, 2003,\n147\u2013161] and illustrate what happens to some of the lowest order unstable periodic orbits as this parameter is increased from\nzero.\nKey words: dynamos, Lorenz equations, unstable periodic orbits\n1. Introduction\nSelf-exciting dynamos are nonlinear electro-mechanical engineering devices or naturally occurring\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) fluid systems such as the geodynamo, operating within the Earth\u2019s liquid\nmetallic outer core, that convert mechanical energy into magnetic energy through the action of motional\ninduction without involving permanent magnets. Because of the intractablity of the governing nonlinear\npartial differential equations in four independent variables, low-dimensional analogues, capable of\nproviding valuable insights into the on-going physical processes have been proposed and investigated.\nIn a seminal paper Hide et al. [5] introduced one such system, comprising three coupled nonlinear\nordinary differential equations, to model the behaviour of a self-exciting homopolar Faraday disk\ndynamo, in an effort to increase our understanding of phenomena such as self-sustaining dynamo action\nin the Earth\u2019s liquid core, especially as regards geomagnetic polarity reversals, and the El-Nin\u02dco Southern\nOscillation, which plays such a dramatic role in influencing global weather patterns.\nLater studies extended the original model of [5] to include investigations of the effects due to a\nnonlinear series motor [6]; coupled systems of Faraday disk dynamos [7, 8]; effects due to azimuthal\neddy currents in a single disk dynamo [1, 2]; the identification of conditions for phase- and amplitude-\nlocked states in coupled disk dynamos with linear series motors [7, 9, 10] and the effects due to external\nbattery and magnetic field terms on the behaviour of a single disk dynamo [11, 12].\nThere has been considerable interest in recent years in identifying the spectrum of underlying unstable\nperiodic orbits (or upos), associated with chaotic time series, as a way of characterising the attractors\nof nonlinear dynamical systems such as the Lorenz equations (see, for example, [13, 14]), themselves\nthe lowest order truncation of the partial differential equations governing Benard convection. As noted\nby Carroll [14], while a chaotic attractor possesses an infinite number of upos, many properties may be\ndetermined from those orbits of lowest period.\n192 I. M. Moroz\nRecent investigations of several different self-exciting Faraday-disk dynamos [1\u20134] have shown the\nclassic Lorenz equations to result in a special limit when one of the key bifurcation parameters, \u03b2,\nwhich measures the inverse moment of inertia of the armature of the dynamo motor, vanishes. In this\npaper we investigate one of those models [3], which we term the extended Malkus\u2013Robbins dynamo (or\nEMR), since it reduces to the Malkus\u2013Robbins equations [15] when \u03b2 = 0. The other dynamo models\nwill form the subjects of future studies. The EMR dynamo, as well as the other two dynamos which\nhave the Lorenz equations as a limiting case, is a set of four coupled nonlinear ordinary differential\nequations, which results from the removal of two of the three electric motors in one of the dynamo\nmodels introduced by Hide [8] and their replacement by resistances.\nWhen \u03b2 = 0, one of the equations decouples, leaving the remaining three as the Lorenz equations,\nafter a simple linear transformation. An exposition of the derivation of the EMR system, its linear\nstability analysis and bifurcation transition sequences can be found in [3]. Our current objectives are to\nillustrate what happens to the lowest order upos, as computed via numerical integrations, as well as the\nreturn maps as we move away from the Lorenz limit.\nFollowing Koga [13], we have labelled each upo as coming from series Lnm , where n denotes the\nnumber of circuits around the left non-trivial equilibrium state, while m the number of circuits around\nthe right non-trivial equilibrium state. In our investigations we have considered n, m = 1, . . . , 10.\nSince any particular initial data set may not yield all of the possible upos up to a certain order, we\nhave proceeded as follows. We used the same initial conditions for each numerical integration, plotting\nhistograms up to, and including, n = m = 10, for all of those orbits which returned to within a given\ndistance \u0002 on the Poincare\u00b4 section in four-dimensional phase space.\nFollowing Koga [13], we transformed the EMR equations so that this Poincare\u00b4 section is on the\nequivalent to the Z = r \u2212 1 plane for the original Lorenz equations (see Section 3). Moreover, we have\nused the classic Lorenz parameters of r = 28, b = 8\/3 and \u03c3 = 10 throughout, indicating what these\ncorrespond to for the dynamo model.\nThis paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we briefly review the pertinent features of calculating\nthe upos and return maps for the Lorenz equations as described in [13]. Section 3 introduces the EMR\nmodel and its transformation which was used in the upo study. We present two cases, including linear\nstability curves in regime diagrams, as well as bifurcation transition sequences for the classic Lorenz\nparameter values, as \u03b2 is increased from zero until the loss of the chaotic regime. In Section 4 we present\nthe return maps and histograms at selected values of \u03b2. Finally we draw our conclusions in Section 5.\n2. Unstable Periodic Orbits in the Lorenz Equations\nIn this section we shall summarise those aspects of Koga\u2019s treatment of the Lorenz equations that will\nserve as a comparison for the dynamo model of the next two sections.\nThe Lorenz equations\nx\u02d9 = \u03c3 (y \u2212 x), (1)\ny\u02d9 = r x \u2212 y \u2212 xz, (2)\nz\u02d9 = \u2212bz + xy, (3)\npossess three equilibrium solutions\n(x0, y0, z0) = (0, 0, 0), (xe, ye, ze) = (\u00b1\n\u221a\nb(r \u2212 1), \u00b1\n\u221a\nb(r \u2212 1), r \u2212 1). (4)\nExtended Malkus\u2013Robbins Dynamo as a Perturbed Lorenz System 193\nThe change of variable\nz\u02c6 = z \u2212 (r \u2212 1),\ntransforms (1)\u2013(3) to\nx\u02d9 = \u03c3 (y \u2212 x), (5)\ny\u02d9 = \u2212y + x(1 \u2212 z\u02c6), (6)\n\u02d9z\u02c6 = \u2212b(z\u02c6 + r \u2212 1) + xy, (7)\nand the equilibria to\n(x0, y0, z\u02c60) = (0, 0, 1 \u2212 r ), (xe, ye, z\u02c6e) = (\u00b1\n\u221a\nb(r \u2212 1), \u00b1\n\u221a\nb(r \u2212 1), 0). (8)\nTaking the Poincare\u00b4 section to be\nS = [(x, y) : z\u02c6 = 0, \u02d9z\u02c6 > 0, x > 0], (9)\nKoga is able to construct two one-dimensional return maps\nXn+1 = f1(Xn), Yn+1 = f2(Yn), (10)\nthe fixed points of which correspond to the upos of the series Ln1 for n = 1, 2, . . .. Here Lnm refers to\nthe trajectory rotating n times around the left focus and m times the right focus, where the foci are the\nnontrivial equilibrium solutions (8) of the Lorenz equations. The upos associated with Lnm for m > 1,\nare generated by iterating the return maps m times and finding their fixed points.\nIn this paper we present results for the classic Lorenz parameter choices of r = 28, \u03c3 = 10 and\nb = 8\/3. Figure 1 reproduces Figure 2 of [13] and shows the first return map in the (Xn, Xn+1)-plane\nfor which z\u02c6 = 0, corresponding to z = 27. The intersections of the arcs of dots with the straight line\nXn = Xn+1 give the L11, L21, . . . in ascending order. To ensure an accurate computation of the values\nof (Xn, Yn) on the Poincare\u00b4 section, we incorporated the numerical code suggested by He\u00b4non [16]. In\nour numerical studies, we integrated the equations for 60,000 s using a time step of 0.001 s, discarding\nthe first 100 s as representing transients. Figure 1 contains 39,678 points.\nFigure 2 shows the histogram of periods of the orbits, as functions of the number of close returns\nwithin a ball of radius \u0002 = 0.05. In terms of the upos Lnm , they represent close returns to within \u0002 = 0.05\nto the fixed points of the mth iterates of the return map for m = 1, . . . , 10. Comparisons of our results\nwith those of [13, 17, 18] were made to validate the accuracy of our approach in calculating the periods\nof the upos.\nWe end this section by remarking that upos for which the periods differ slightly from the ones tabulated\nin [13] correspond to orbits which differ slightly in the order in which they circuit around the left or the\nright equilibrium state.\n194 I.

THE LORENZ LIMIT\nThe nondirectional extended Malkus\u2013Robbins (EMR) dynamo\nY \u2032 = \u03c3 (Z \u2212 Y ) \u2212 \u02c6\u03b2U, (11)\nExtended Malkus\u2013Robbins Dynamo as a Perturbed Lorenz System 195\nZ \u2032 = Y W \u2212 Z , (12)\nW \u2032 = R \u2212 \u03b1ZY \u2212 \u03bdW, (13)\nU \u2032 = Y \u2212 \u0006U, (14)\nis a system of four coupled nonlinear differential equations, describing the behaviour of the Malkus\u2013\nRobbins dynamo [15], when a motor is coupled to the disk and coil. In (11)\u2013(14) Z (t) represents the\ncurrent flowing through the disk; Y (t) is the current flowing through the coil; W (t) the angular velocity\nof the rotating disk and U (t) the angular velocity of the motor.\nThe parameters appearing in (11)\u2013(14) are all real and positive: \u03b1 represents the steady couple, applied\nto the disk and causing it to rotate; \u03bd is the re-scaled mechanical friction \u03ba of the disk and \u0006 that of the\nmotor; R is a scaled and translated version of \u03b1; \u02c6\u03b2 = \u03bd2\u03b2\/\u03ba2, where \u03b2 measures the inverse moment\nof inertia of the armature of the motor and \u03c3 depends upon the inductances and resistances of the coil\nand brushes. The reader is referred to [3] for a more detailed discussion and derivation of (11)\u2013(14).\nIt is possible to remove explicit reference to \u03b1 from (13) via the transformation\n(W, Z , Y, U ) \u2192 \u03b1\u22121\/2(\u03b11\/2W, Z , Y, U ).\nIf we also then introduce \u02c6W = R\/\u03bd \u2212 W , (3.1) becomes\nY \u2032 = \u03c3 (Z \u2212 Y ) \u2212 \u02c6\u03b2U, (15)\nZ \u2032 = R\/\u03bdY \u2212 Y \u02c6W \u2212 Z , (16)\n\u02c6W \u2032 = ZY \u2212 \u03bd \u02c6W , (17)\nU \u2032 = Y \u2212 \u0006U. (18)\nWhen \u02c6\u03b2 = 0, the evolution of U effectively decouples from Equations (15)\u2013(17) and we recover the\nLorenz equations (1)\u2013(3) under the correspondence\n(Y, Z , \u02c6W , U ) \u0003\u2212\u2192 (x, y, z, 0), (\u03c3, R\/\u03bd, \u03bd, \u02c6\u03b2) \u0003\u2212\u2192 (\u03c3, r, b, 0). (19)\nThe perturbations away from the Lorenz equations, which are the subject of this paper, involve the\nre-introduction of \u02c6\u03b2 and the investigation of what befalls the upos as \u02c6\u03b2 increases from zero.\n3.2. THE POINCARE\u00b4 SECTION\nThe system (15)\u2013(18) possesses three equilibrium solutions\nW0 = (Y0, Z0, \u02c6W0, U0) = (0, 0, 0, 0), (20)\nwhich we term the trivial equilibrium state and\nWe = (Ye, Ze, \u02c6We, Ue), (21)\n196 I. M. Moroz\nwhere\n\u02c6We = R\n\u03bd\n\u2212\n(\n1 +\n\u02c6\u03b2\n\u0006\u03c3\n)\n, Ze = Ye\n(\n1 +\n\u02c6\u03b2\n\u0006\u03c3\n)\n, Ue = Ye\n\u0006\n, Ye = \u00b1\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a \u03bd\n\u02c6We\n(\n1 + \u02c6\u03b2\n\u0006\u03c3\n) . (22)\nBy analogy with the Lorenz equations, we take the Poincare\u00b4 section onW = 0 where\nW = \u02c6W \u2212 \u02c6We.\nThen (15)\u2013(18) transforms to\nY \u2032 = \u03c3 (Z \u2212 Y ) \u2212 \u02c6\u03b2U, (23)\nZ \u2032 = Y\n[(\n1 +\n\u02c6\u03b2\n\u0006\u03c3\n)\n\u2212W\n]\n\u2212 Z , (24)\nW \u2032 = ZY \u2212 \u03bd(W + \u02c6We), (25)\nU \u2032 = Y \u2212 \u0006U. (26)\nThe nontrivial equilibrium states are now\nWe = (Ye, Ze, 0, Ue),\nand the Poincare\u00b4 section is\n\u02c6S = [(Y, Z , U ) :W = 0, \u02d9W > 0, Y > 0]. (27)\n3.3. THE LINEAR STABILITY CURVES\nThere are four different parameter regimes of interest, according as \u0006\u2277 1 and \u03c3 \u2277 1 + \u03bd [3]. When\n\u0006 < 1 and \u03c3 > 1 + \u03bd, as well as the Lorenz subcritical Hope bifurcation on \u02c6\u03b2 = 0, there is a\nTakes\u2013Bodansky double-zero bifurcation in \u02c6\u03b2 > 0. A curve of subcritical Hope bifurcations connects\nthe two bifurcation points. When \u0006 > 1 and \u03c3 > 1 + \u03bd, no double-zero bifurcations are possible,\nand the curve of subcritical Hope bifurcations simply extends into the \u02c6\u03b2 > 0 regime. Since the Lorenz\nparameter values of (r, \u03c3, b) = (24.74, 10, 8\/3) for the subcritical Hope bifurcation correspond to\n(R, \u03c3, \u03bd) = (65.965, 10, 8\/3), we are in the \u03c3 > 1 + \u03bd regime and do not need to investigate the\nremaining two cases outline above. The interested reader is referred to [3] for a discussion of these two\ncases within a different context. We remark that r = 28 corresponds to R = 74.667.\n3.4. \u0006 > 1 AND \u03c3 > 1 + \u03bd\nAs a typical example of what happens when \u0006 > 1, we chose \u0006 = 3.2 with \u03c3 = 10 and \u03bd = 8\/3\nthroughout. Figure 3 shows the linear stability curves for the trivial and nontrivial equilibrium states.\nExtended Malkus\u2013Robbins Dynamo as a Perturbed Lorenz System 197\nFigure 3. Linear stability curves for case (i) with \u0006 = 3.2, \u03c3 = 10, \u03bd = 8\/3 and \u03ba = 1. The Hope bifurcation curve associated\nwith the nontrivial states is denoted by H , while the curve of steady bifurcation from the trivial equilibrium state is denoted by\ns. Also shown is the classic Lorenz parameter choice of r = 28 or R = 74.667.\nThere is a line of steady bifurcations (labelled as s) and given by\nRs = \u03bd\n(\n1 +\n\u02c6\u03b2\n\u03c3\u0006\n)\n, (28)\ntogether with a curve of Hope bifurcations (labelled as H ), which is computed numerically following\nthe procedure outlined in [3]. We have used \u03b2 instead of \u02c6\u03b2, where \u02c6\u03b2 = \u03bd2\u03b2\/\u03ba2, for ease of comparison\nwith the EMR study in [3]. In all of our calculations we set \u03ba = 1.\nAs in the EMR study, steady dynamo solutions dominate the region between H and s, with a narrow\nband of chaotic solutions extending slightly beyond H because this is a curve of subcritical Hope\nbifurcations. The horizontal tick mark on the R axis, and labelled Rlor, corresponds to r = 28.\nFigure 4 shows the bifurcation transition sequence observed as \u03b2 increases from zero for r = 28.\nThis is a plot of the local maximum amplitude of the oscillatory solution, as measured here byW , as\na function of \u03b2, having discarded the initial transient at each increment; the final conditions of one\nintegration being used as the initial data for the next. Chaotic solutions extend well into the \u03b2 > 0\nregime, until \u03b2 \u2248 8, when stability is lost to a steady state solution, given by the transformed equivalent\nto (22), which persists for larger values of \u03b2.\nIn Section 4 we shall see what happens to the maps of first return, the equivalent to the (Xn, Xn+1)\nand\/or (Yn, Yn+1) maps for the Lorenz equations described in Section 2, as well as the histograms of\nupos as \u03b2 increases along this transition sequence.\n3.5. \u0006 < 1 AND \u03c3 > 1 + \u03bd\nWhen \u0006 = 0.5, we obtain the linear stability curves, shown in Figure 5.

The loss of chaotic behaviour is now\nto a stable periodic limit cycle when \u03b2 \u2248 4.\nExtended Malkus\u2013Robbins Dynamo as a Perturbed Lorenz System 199\nFigure 6. As in Figure 4 but for \u0006 = 0.5.\n4. Upos in the EMR Dynamo\nWe now present a selection of the results of our numerical integrations of (23)\u2013(26) for \u03b2 \u0005= 0 for the\ntwo cases outlined above. We preface this discussion with a comment concerning the Lorenz limit of\n(23)\u2013(26) and the selection of a close return on the Poincare\u00b4 sectionW = 0.\nSince (23)\u2013(26) is a four-variable system, we have used the condition\n\u2016Wi \u2212 W j\u2016 =\n\u221a\n(Yi \u2212 Y j )2 + (Zi \u2212 Z j )2 + (Wi \u2212W j )2 + (Ui \u2212 U j )2 < \u0002\nwhich includes U as opposed to\n\u2016Xi \u2212 X j\u2016 =\n\u221a\n(Xi \u2212 X j )2 + (Yi \u2212 Y j )2 + +(z\u02c6i \u2212 z\u02c6 j )2 < \u0002\nfor the Lorenz equations (5)\u2013(7) to determine closeness of returns onW = 0, where i and j denote the\ni th and j th intersections. This has the consequence of producing a different number of close returns\nwhen \u03b2 = 0 than for the actual Lorenz equations, but yields identical first return maps.\nIn all of our numerical integrations we used the same initial conditions\n(Y, Z ,W, U ) = (10.185360, 5.8512615, 9.4864804, 2.5969457),\nto ensure that the variations in the histograms and in the first return maps were due solely to the variation\nin \u03b2, rather than reflecting any dependency upon the initial conditions. Our choice of \u03bd = 8\/3 means\nthat \u02c6\u03b2 = 7.1111\u03b2.\nFor the Lorenz equations, the Poincare\u00b4 section z\u02c6 = 0 was equivalent to taking z = 27 in (1)\u2013(3). For\nthe EMR equations, the Poincare\u00b4 sectionW = 0 corresponds to taking W = (1 + \u02c6\u03b2\/\u0006\u03c3 ) in (11)\u2013(14).\n200 I. M. Moroz\nFigure 7. The first return maps of Yn and Zn for \u0006 = 3.2 and \u03b2 = 0.5.\n4.1. \u0006 > 1 AND \u03c3 > 1 + \u03bd\nAs in Section 2, we integrated the EMR equations (23)\u2013(26) for 60, 000 s at a time step of 0.001 s\n(exactly the same as for the Lorenz equations), choosing \u0002 = 0.05 as defining the ball of close returns.\nThe maps of first returns are now plotted as Yn v Yn+1 and\/or Zn v Zn+1 and histograms of the upos up\nto and including the 10th return maps are shown.\nWhen \u03b2 = 0, the first return maps for Yn and Zn are identical to those for the Lorenz equations, and\nso are not reproduced here. We simply note that the histogram contains 504 close returns.\nWe now increase \u03b2. Figure 7 shows the (Yn, Yn+1) and (Zn, Zn+1) first returns for \u03b2 = 0.5, while\nFigure 8 shows the histogram up to series 10. A very interesting banding structure has emerged in both\nmaps, in marked contrast to the Lorenz limit, and which persists for higher values of \u03b2. Perusal of the\nclose returns data shows the presence of L11 (period of approximately 1.562 s), L21 (2.324 s), L31 (3.065\ns), L41 (3.786 s), and L61 (5.226 s) from the series Ln1. The corresponding periods for these upos in\nthe Lorenz system are [13]: (1.5587, 2.3059, 3.0236, 3.7256, 5.1030) s, respectively. Increasing \u03b2 and\nso perturbing away from the Lorenz equations has not only increased the periods of the upos, but has\neliminated some of those present in the Lorenz limit, such as L51 that we observed in our benchmark\nintegrations. Of course, there is nothing to prevent such orbits appearing during a longer integration or\nfor a different initial data, but that was not our objective here.\nIncreasing \u03b2 to \u03b2 = 2, Figure 9 shows the growing prominence of the two-banded structure of the\nfirst return maps; Figure 10 shows the corresponding histogram. Immediately apparent is the increase\nin the number of L11 orbits, as well as the relatively clean peaks at other periods. Figure 11 shows\npart of the time series for Y (t), together with a selection of phase portraits, obtained using the same\ninitial data. In Figure 12 we show the only Ln1-series upos which are present in the histogram. These\nare the L11 orbit with period 1.591 s, the L21 orbit (period 2.417 s) and the L31 orbit (period 3.239 s).\nA selection of the lowest order Ln2-series orbits are shown in Figure 13, including one which involves\nExtended Malkus\u2013Robbins Dynamo as a Perturbed Lorenz System 201\nFigure 8.

They are L22 (period\n3.256 s), L32 (periods 4.081 and 4.012 s, respectively) and L52 (period of 5.748 s). We remark that\nthe upo, which cycles twice around one of the equilibria and then three times around the other, has a\nslightly longer period than its companion. Again the values of the periods of the upos are larger than\ntheir Lorenz counterparts and for the \u03b2 = 2 case.\n202 I. M. Moroz\nFigure 10. As in Figure 8 but for \u03b2 = 2.\nFigure 11. A section of the time series of Y (t), together with a selection of phase portraits for \u03b2 = 2.\nOur final illustration in this subsection is for \u03b2 = 7.25, close to the loss of chaos and transition\nto steady dynamo action. The first return maps (Figure 14) now show that many of the upos have\ndisappeared and the double banding structure is converging in the (Yn, Yn+1) plot. The L11 upo now\ndominates the histogram (Figure 15). The only series Ln1 upos observed in our integrations for \u03b2 = 7.25\nare the L11 orbit with period 1.967 s and the L21 orbit with period 3.104 s. These are shown in Figure 16,\nwhile Figure 17 shows the lowest order Ln2 cycles: the L22 (period 4.152 s) and two L32 cycles (periods\n5.295 and 5.063 s, respectively). Finally Figure 18 shows the actual time series and phase portraits.\nExtended Malkus\u2013Robbins Dynamo as a Perturbed Lorenz System 203\nFigure 12.

This periodic behaviour is associated with a supercritical\n204 I. M. Moroz\nFigure 14. As in Figure 7 but for \u03b2 = 7.25.\nFigure 15.

The presence of the Takes\u2013Bodansky double-zero\nbifurcation from which emanate a supercritical Hope bifurcation (associated with the trivial equilibrium\nstate) and a subcritical Hope bifurcation (associated with the nontrivial equilibria), terminating at the\nLorenz subcritical Hope bifurcation point, strongly influence the upo spectrum and render the \u0006 < 1\ncase far more sensitive to perturbations from \u03b2 = 0 than when \u0006 > 1.\nExtended Malkus\u2013Robbins Dynamo as a Perturbed Lorenz System 205\nFigure 16.

The lowest order series Ln2 observed in the histogram of Figure 15.\nFigure 19 shows the first returns maps in (Yn, Yn+1)-space for \u03b2 = 0.01, \u03b2 = 0.02, \u03b2 = 0.04 and\n\u03b2 = 0.08. The corresponding histograms, not shown here, contain very few points. For example, when\n\u03b2 = 0.5, we only found 9 close returns with 60, 000, 000 time steps. Gone is the elegant system of\ncurves obtained by Koga [13] for the (Yn, Yn+1) plots, while the (Zn, Zn+1) plots (not shown here) still\nretain traces of that structure. The situation improves, however, as we increase \u03b2.\n206 I. M. Moroz\nFigure 18. A section of the time series of Y (t), together with a selection of phase portraits for \u03b2 = 7.25.\nFigure 19.

The only\nseries Ln1 upo observed was L11 with period 1.442 s and shown as the top pair in Figure 22. We remark\nthat this period is lower than the corresponding L11 of the Lorenz equations (whose period is 1.5587 s).\nStructure begins to re-emerge in the return maps when \u03b2 is increased further, while the histograms\nget much simpler. Figures 23 and 24 show the scenario for \u03b2 = 3.5. The upo L11 dominates with a\nExtended Malkus\u2013Robbins Dynamo as a Perturbed Lorenz System 207\nFigure 20.

Although the plot for \u03b2 = 0.01 has the nontrivial equilibria passing\nthroughW = 0, this is clearly not the case for \u03b2 = 4.1. Indeed the other two phase portraits show a\ncompetition in play between these two limiting influences.\n208 I. M. Moroz\nFigure 22. As in Figure 12 but for \u0006 = 0.5.\nFigure 23.

Discussion\nThe importance of self-exciting Faraday disk dynamos, of which the EMR dynamo is one example, rests\nin their containing some of the key ingredients of the large-scale naturally occurring MHD dynamos,\nwhile being of considerably lower dimension and so much more amenable to systematic investigations.\nExtended Malkus\u2013Robbins Dynamo as a Perturbed Lorenz System 209\nFigure 24. As in Figure 21 but for \u03b2 = 3.5.\nFigure 25. The phase portraits in the (Y,W)-plane for \u03b2 = 0.01, \u03b2 = 3.5, \u03b2 = 4.0 and \u03b2 = 4.1.\nThey can exhibit irregular reversals, as well as steady dynamo action, multiple solutions (due to hysteresis\neffects) and the nonlinear quenching of oscillatory behaviour [19].\nSince so many of the low order dynamo models of this family, investigated since [5], have rich ranges\nof behaviour with reversals a feature, what has been lacking has been some way of distinguishing\nbetween all of these and other models as a prelude to comparing them with the large-scale counterparts.\n210 I. M. Moroz\nOne possible avenue is via the identification of the spectrum of unstable periodic orbits, as well as their\nbehaviour when key parameters in the problem vary.\nA first attempt along these lines has been achieved with the present study for the EMR dynamo. This\nsystem has the added interest of reducing to the Lorenz equations when one of the parameters vanishes.\nSince these equations have received considerable attention in the literature with regard to their upo\nstructure, perturbations away from the Lorenz limit were viewed as an ideal starting point. Future work\nwill build upon this as well as investigating two of the other Faraday disk dynamos that have the Lorenz\nequations as a limiting case [2, 4]. Others do not and their upo structure has yet to be determined; these\nwill also be investigated.\nReferences\n1. Hide, R. and Moroz, I.
