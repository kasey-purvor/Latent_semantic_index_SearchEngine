In particular, we attempt to locate the role which ideas about heritage \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n3 \n \nand social and moral values have played in constructing this debate. We begin by \nexamining the English National Curriculum\u201fs origin in the 1980s as a conservative exercise \nin stemming cultural crisis, and the discourse about literature's role in the curriculum which \nthis helped construct. We then examine how this discourse has influenced, and continues to \ninfluence, the educational policy of prescribing a list of authors and consider the \nassumptions that are embedded in this policy. Finally, we reflect upon how the material \nconditions of the classroom provide a site of resistance, or difficulty, for the officially \nsanctioned discourse concerning literature's role in the curriculum.  \nKey words: canon; Cox Report; English teachers; National Curriculum; prescribed \nauthors.  \nIntroduction \nThe new National Curriculum (launched on 12th July 2007 by the \nQualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) and due for implementation in \nSeptember 2008) has been met with some conflicting views about both the nature and \nthe significance of its reforms. On the one hand, the revised curriculum has been \nbranded as a significant shift in UK educational policy. Its express commitment to a \n\u201eless prescriptive, more flexible framework for teaching', which will allow teachers to \nexercise creativity in their delivery of topics and 'tailor the curriculum to meet the needs \nof each individual student\u201f (QCA 2007) has been characterised in some quarters as the \nbiggest shake-up in secondary education for years (The Independent 2007), with some \nreports even suggesting that schools are being encouraged 'to tear up their timetables' in \nfavour of radical new classroom practices (Lightfoot 2007). On the other hand, \ncommentators have claimed that the reforms do not go far enough. Mary Bousted, for \nexample, the ATL general secretary, argues that by hanging on to the teaching of \ndiscrete subjects, the QCA has missed the opportunity to overhaul the curriculum, \nmaking it hard for teachers to meet differing learning styles and needs (Bousted 2007). \nThe source of these contradictory views can be uncovered in the QCA press releases \nthat accompanied the new curriculum's launch. Here, we find a marked ambiguity. \nWhile stressing the radical nature of its reforms, the QCA simultaneously sought to \nreassure more conservative observers that its changes to the curriculum did not reflect \n\u201esome new-age obsession with making students feel good\u201f (Boston 2007), nor a \ndestruction of traditional teaching practices in favour of \u201etrendy\u201f progressiveness and  \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n4 \n \na return to child centred learning.  \nThe tensions played out at the launch of the new curriculum reflect a familiar \ntheme: the issue of how to reconcile progress with tradition in order to provide \neducational developments that build on the best of the past. Amid the various debates \nthat have surrounded the launch of the new National Curriculum, nowhere has the issue \nof past versus future been more sharply defined than in the case of literature. This is \nbecause attitudes towards literature's place in the curriculum accentuate how the \nambition to provide an increased sense of flexibility, efficacy and practical purpose can \nbe complicated by a tangle of other considerations. In this regard, literature, above all \nsubjects, is a political matter (Jones 1992a). Firstly, literature has long been one of the \nsubjects most hamstrung by government directives, with politicians on occasion ready \nto intercede over matters of content, and to legislate about what in the curriculum may \nor may 'not be touched' (The Independent 2007, also see Foden 2006). Secondly, there \nhas also long been a reactionary quality among the press and public where literature is \nconcerned. On these terms, literary works have become embroiled with the clarion call \nof 'standards', with booklists of what literature is being taught at any given time seen as \nproviding a ready indicator for distinguishing between the maintenance of intellectual \nstandards and signs of \u201edumbing down\u201f. Just such a discussion, indeed, accompanied \nthe new curriculum\u201fs launch with extensive coverage of the 'heritage' novels on schools \nlists, and newspapers proclaiming the list of authors 'every teenager should read' (The \nIndependent 2007). Literature's totemic place in the new curriculum was, furthermore, \nunderlined, on these terms, by Ken Boston, Chief executive of the Qualifications and \nCurriculum Authority during his launch speech and the interviews that followed. For \nBoston, literature provided a key point of reassurance for his audience that educational \nstandards would be maintained. 'Books will still have to be read' he promised, and not \njust any books: the credibility of the new curriculum could be confirmed by noting that \ncertain authors would still be prescribed (The Independent 2007). In reflecting upon \nhow English literature is discussed in this way, we get a sense of the assumptions that \nare embedded about the discipline. The debate that dominates newspaper headlines \ncontinues to invoke a conception of literature bound-up in discussion of which authors \nare 'in' and which are 'out'  (Woodward and Smithers 2006) and displacement of debate \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n5 \n \nsurrounding efficacy, or the politics surrounding an issue such as how certain texts \ncome to be prescribed in the first place. In this respect, the launch of the new National \nCurriculum underlines a view of literature not as a contested, and highly political field \nof knowledge which is the product of complex and contingent social processes and \nforces, but instead as an 'a-historical, a-social, non-power-laden category' (Kress 1995, \n35).  \nIn this article, we seek to unpick some of these matters by looking at the \nhistorical background to literature\u201fs inclusion in the National Curriculum and how this \npaved the way for a list of prescribed authors. We ask the question what is the mode of \nexistence of literature teaching discourse, tracing the arguments surrounding literature \nthrough several of their incarnations leading to the present. In doing so, we examine the \nterms of debate via which literature is contested as a site of policy making, how its \nexistence as a field of knowledge is complicated by assumptions about social and moral \nvalues and, perhaps most strikingly, how some key ideas about literature became \nenshrined in educational policy in spite of express recommendations to the contrary. \nWe also explore the relationship between teachers, students and the \u201ecanon\u201f in order to \nquestion the value of prescribing authors for study in schools. Specifically, we enquire \ninto the sense of efficacy that is held to reside in the choice of texts in the classroom and \ninvestigate the extent to which teachers' choice of texts balance pragmatism with a \nsense of responsibility to canonical and political considerations. In this regard, we aim \nto enhance understanding of the relationship between beliefs about literature enshrined \nwithin government policy and the practical implementation of this policy in the \nclassroom.  \nLiterature\u2019s journey into the National Curriculum \nThe National Curriculum English Working Group was formally set up on 29th \nApril 1988 to \u201eadvise on attainment targets, programmes of study and associated \nassessment arrangements for English in the National Curriculum for the period of \ncompulsory schooling\u201f (Cox 1991, 4). The group, headed by Brian Cox, submitted its \nrecommendations for the teaching of English in secondary schools in June 1989 (the \nCox Report), and, after slight amendment, these recommendations were implemented \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n6 \n \nin 1990. Within the new mandatory programme of education, teachers in England and \nWales were, for the first time, required to adopt a national, prescribed course for the \ninstruction and evaluation of English. This was heralded as a new dawn in education \nwhich \u201eshould bring about revolutionary changes in the schools, and indeed have some \ninfluence on our national character\u201f (Cox 1991, 152).  \nAlthough, at the time, apparently unprecedented, the Cox Report, in fact, \nrepresented the culmination of decades of disputation about both the educational role \nthat literature might fulfil and the constituencies at whom it should be directed. In the \n1950s, a distinction had been enshrined between grammar schools, which included \nliterature in their programmes of study, and secondary moderns, which utilised primers \nto enable pupils to develop practical language and literacy skills (Medway 1990). In the \n1960s, the advent of comprehensive schools ended the segregation of the 'philosophers' \nand the 'labourers', and literary education was extended to all children. In this era, \nteachers were left to decide for themselves how English literature should be taught in \nthe blended classroom (Jones 2003) as under the influence of developments in \npsychology, sociology and linguistics, child-centred learning and the idea of the \nself-actualisation of the student held precedence over the idea of literature as a channel \nfor culture. However, by the mid 1970s concerns over \u201etrendy\u201f teaching methods began \nto foster debate about national standards. This was fuelled by a series of cause celebre \nsuch as the William Tyndale Junior School Affair of 1974-76, in which much capital \nwas made of the fact that the school was run as a co-operative (see Davis 2002, and \nWoodward 2001) and that William Tyndale\u201fs head teacher Terry Ellis pursued a policy \nof non-compliance, reportedly exclaiming that his school \u201e\u201cdid not give a damn about \nparents\u201d\u201f (Woodward 2001).  This, coupled with a decline in the UK economy, created \na general sense that standards were slipping. From 1969 to 1977, the Black Papers, \nedited by academics Brian Cox and AE Dyson, conducted a campaign against the \nstandards and behaviour in the comprehensive schools with particular reference to the \ndecline in the teaching of English language and literature. The traditional belief that the \ngovernment should not interfere with the curriculum of state schools came under \npressure until eventually, in 1976, Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan proposed a \n\u201ecore curriculum of basic knowledge\u201f and \u201ea proper national standard of performance\u201f \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n7 \n \n(Callaghan 1976 in Woodward 2001).  The Conservatives, under Margaret Thatcher, \ndeveloped Callaghan\u201fs educational ideas, with the Black Papers providing an \nintellectual basis for Thatcherite views on education and the arts. Under Thatcherism, \nprogressivism was conflated with the decline of traditional values, the erosion of \nnational identity, and the fall in national productivity. The suspicion that \u201edangerous, \npolitically motivated teachers\u201f had taken control of the comprehensive schools (Ball et \nal 1990, 64) eventually led Thatcher\u201fs Conservative government to seek to wrest \ncontrol of the curriculum. The editor of the Black Papers, Brian Cox, was thus duly \ninvited in 1989 to draft a National Curriculum for English that would place literature at \nthe heart of the curriculum. \nFrom the outset then, literature\u201fs journey into the National Curriculum was \nbound-up with concerns over the nation\u201fs moral and social welfare. The Cox Report, \nwhile acknowledging literature\u201fs capacity to develop pupils\u201f practical language and \nliteracy skills, responded to this by casting literature primarily as a remedy for malaise \nand a bulwark against a cultural drift downmarket (Cox 1995, 181). Indeed, one of the \nlarger themes of the Cox Report is embroiled with a sense of faith in the transforming \npower of culture or paideia (Jaegar 1986). In this respect, the Cox Report looks both \ninward at the potential of literature to develop the individual child, and outward at \nliterature\u201fs potential to pass on the culture from one generation to the next, and \ncritically understand of what culture consists (Cox 1991, 22).  In the following \nsections of this article, we look at the history of the ideas about literature that are \nembedded in the Cox Report, and consider the salience of such ideas for modern \ncurriculum making. We then consider how these theories about literature influenced the \ngovernment\u201fs decision to issue a list of prescribed authors in 1993, and how these \ntheories continue to inform educational policy today. \nThe Cox Report and the mode of existence of literature discourse  \nOn the face of it, the Cox Report argues against prescribing authors for use in \nschools, setting its store by the argument that teachers are better placed than \ngovernment officials to understand the particular needs of their pupils and to cater to \nthese needs through the selection of texts (Cox 1991). For the Cox Report, adopting this \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n8 \n \nposition is, if nothing else, a matter of good sense:  \nIf a list of set books had been included in the Statutory Orders, it is easy to \n imagine how after ten or so years teachers would be desperately trying to \n change it, with old-fashioned Members of Parliament resisting in lively debates. \n (Cox 1991, 69)  \nThe rhetoric here is, though, misleading. Although apparently rejecting a \npreferred list of authors, the Cox Report nevertheless presents an attitude towards \nliterature that leads inexorably back to just such a list. This is because the discourse of \nliterature teaching established in the Cox Report is founded on a conservative, and \n'common sense' conception. Literature teaching is constructed as an activity that should \ncelebrate the best in culture, in which you simply cannot get away from the fact that \nsome texts are better than others (Cox 1995, 181). The Cox Report thus 'outlines a \nmodel of reading which keeps in place the reader's humble relationship to \"great \nliterature\"\u201f (Jones 1992, 16). As Robert Owens argues, 'We are advised to expose \nourselves to [literature], revere it, learn timeless human truths from it' (Owens 1992, \n101). Furthermore, the Cox Report provides a framework for selecting the most \nappropriate texts. These are the texts that 1) might morally improve us 2) contribute to \nour sense of cultural heritage and 3) help us to construct a common culture (cf. Cox \n1991, 70-78). The Cox Report, thus, not only argues that literature is good for you, it \nalso embeds certain assumptions about just what it is that constitutes good literature. To \nestablish its perspective securely, the Cox Report, furthermore, consistently relativises \nliterary theories that challenge its views about the purpose and value of texts:  \nI cannot deny that the literature chapter takes for granted major \nassumptions about the value of great literature in the curriculum, \nand does not engage with the many recent books which have \nchallenged this belief. (Cox 1991, 70)  \nIn the Cox Report we repeated the belief of many teachers of \nEnglish that the study of literature does foster intelligence and \nsensibility, as Leavis so passionately argued. We were not \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n9 \n \nconvinced by the arguments to the contrary. (Cox 1991, 75) \nAs the reference to Leavis here suggests, in presenting this view the Cox Report \naligns itself with the literary perspective developed in the Victorian and post Victorian \nera among some of English literature's most celebrated writers: writers for whom the \nteaching of literature is both a site of opportunity and responsibility, who collectively \nestablish a view of literature as an entity with the power to cultivate minds and civilise \nsociety. In this respect, we can, for instance, discern the influence of George Eliot and \nher view that the writer \u201einevitably assumes the office of teacher or influencer of the \npublic mind\u201f (Eliot, 1879\/1973, 94); of Mathew Arnold (1882\/2006) and his mission to \nHellenise the philistine English middle classes via romantic and humanist principles; \nand, as noted, of F.R. Leavis (1948) and his merging of Eliot's moralism with Arnold's \nsense of social vision to argue that great novelists express \u201ea marked moral sensitivity\u201f \nthat may be transmitted to their readers (Leavis 1948, 9) and thus contribute to their \nwell being and sense of self. Just as these views can be seen to exert a powerful \ninfluence on the fashion of English criticism for most of the twentieth century, so they \ncan be seen to clearly underpin the attitude we find in the Cox Report.  \nLiterature and moral improvement \nFirstly, for the Cox Report literature is a phenomenon with the power to act as an \nautomatic moral instructor. The argument for literature's ability to contribute to moral \nwelfare can be found in more and less extreme guises across the twentieth century and \nhas drifted in and out of focus for curriculum makers over recent decades. For a \ndetailed, contemporary account of this argument we can, though, look to professor of \nethics and character education, Karen Bohlin (2005). According to Bohlin, the \ndevelopment of National Curriculum Citizenship in the UK and concerns over rising \nlevels of school violence in the USA have made literature\u201fs ability to contribute to \nmoral welfare \u201eonce again a hot topic\u201f (Bohlin 2005, 1). Her view is persuasive in that \nwe can certainly find a range of arguments currently propagated about literature's role \nin society and its importance for moral education - see for example the QCA\u201fs (2008) \nrecommendations for the use of literature to assist pupils\u201f personal development in \nresponse to Every Child Matters (DfES 2003). Under Bohlin's account, great literature \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n10 \n \nprovides \u201ea window to the soul, through which we can examine the internal and external \nfactors involved in becoming or failing to become the kind of person we admire or \nrespect\u201f (Bohlin 2005, 24). According to Bohlin, \u201egood novelists are not only good \nstorytellers, but also great psychological portrait painters\u201f (Bohlin 2005, 18) and texts \nenable teachers to \u201egive students the practice they need to become connoisseurs of \nvicarious experience\u201f (Bohlin 2005, 31) and thereby practice moral judgement. In their \nmost extreme form, Bohlin's arguments occasionally even propose a linear relationship \nbetween the proper use of literature and social cohesion. In this regard, it is instructive \nto note that Bohlin sees literature as a particularly vital source of character education - \nor of what she terms the \u201eschooling of desire\u201f (Bohlin 2005, 18) for pupils from \ndeprived backgrounds. By studying 'great literature', Bohlin argues, deprived pupils not \nonly imbibe morality, they develop a new engagement with life: \u201ethe analysis of \nmorally pivotal points in the lives of characters in literature helps to illuminate an \nindividual\u201fs \u201e\u201creason to be happy\u201d\u201f (Bohlin 2005, 178). Though this perspective may \nseem rather zealous it is by no means unusual. A related view has also recently been \nendorsed by John Carey (2005) who argues strongly for literature's efficacy when used \nas a source of moral education. For Carey, faith that literature alters thought and \nbehaviour is confirmed by a recent project undertaken at Deerholt young offenders\u201f \ninstitution in Durham, in which several young offenders studied William Golding\u201fs \nLord of the Flies. The young offenders\u201f responses to the experience are cited by Carey \nin validation of his argument. He notes, for instance, that one of them, who had been \nimprisoned for robbing a taxi driver, claimed that \u201ethe book had made him think about \ncivilization, and how it would collapse into chaos without law, and had even made it \neasier for him to accept being sent to prison for what he did\u201f (Carey 2005, 211). Citing \nthis study, Carey concludes that literature provides a source of moral development and \npersonal contentment and that \u201eonce [literature\u201fs] words are lodged in your mind they \nare indistinguishable from the way you think\u201f (Carey 2005, 245). Though there is a \nrange of emphasis in how literature is depicted as a source of moral education, under all \naccounts, one theme is consistent: literature is a means of forming citizens and creating \nsocial stability. \nLiterature, national identity and the common culture  \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n11 \n \nWhile the Cox Report draws attention to the personal benefits to be gained through \nthe study of literature, it also highlights literature\u201fs potential to bind individuals into a \nsociety through the creation of a common culture. This argument, like the moral \nargument, may be traced to the nineteenth century, when, once again, figures such as \nArnold (1882\/2006) advocated culture as a means to homogenise a nation divided along \nclass lines. Perhaps the most influential exponent of this view, as Robert Eaglestone \n(2000) notes, is T.S. Eliot. Eliot's essays of literary criticism, written during the 1920s, \nargue that the living tradition of great Western literature is part of who we (British \npeople) are (Eaglestone 2000, 55). Furthermore, for Eliot, people must \u201egenetically\u201f \nshare idea of the canon, and the \u201euniversal\u201f Western European values that underlie it, 'in \ntheir bones', as it is only through absorption in the great artefacts of Western literature \nthat people are able to access, and own, the culture of which they are a part and \nthereafter to contribute to its future (Eaglestone 2000, 55). For Eliot, the canon is thus \nthe means of sustaining and transmitting not only our culture but ourselves (cf. \nEaglestone 2000, 55). A response to T.S. Eliot\u201fs attitude towards the canon is evident in \nthe Cox Report, where literary education is cast not only as a bridge across class \ndivisions, but as a means of homogenising children from diverse ethnic backgrounds. \nThe texts that have helped shape the way British people think and speak, we are told, \nwill provide all children with a \u201ecommon range of reference\u201f (Cox 1991, 71) and \nthereby enable them, regardless of their ethnic origin, both to understand and contribute \nto the future of British culture.  \nClosely related to, yet distinguishable from, the argument that literature enables \npupils to access and contribute to a common culture is the argument that literature \nfosters a sense of national identity. This view sees literature as a system of culture that \nembodies public sentiment about 'country' by providing a shared stock of images, ideas, \nstories and traditions, all of which go together to help each of us imagine and so identify \nourselves as (for example) English (Eaglestone 2000, 104-105). As such, literature is \nheld to provide a point of stability by offering a reference point against which people \nmight orientate themselves, develop a sense of their own identity, and eventually a \nmeans by which they might imagine themselves to be part of a wider process \u2013 in \nBenedict Anderson\u201fs language - moving through history. In this argument, culture \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n12 \n \nhomogenises children of different classes and races by contrasting the unified \u201eus\u201f with \nan external \u201eother\u201f (Meek 2001, ix). Though foregrounding cultural difference, this \nargument makes light of any suggestion of xenophobia by casting national literatures as \na source of benevolence towards other cultures. The celebration of local, domestic \nhistory and distinctive features become the nation's 'contribution to the cultural \ndiversity of the world' (Gundem 1996, 62).  \nThe Cox Report endorses the notion of text as store house of national identity, \nclaiming \u201eAt the level of whole societies, written language serves the functions of \nrecord-keeping and storing both information and literary works\u201f (Cox 1991, 140). This \nis also affirmed in the Cox Report by the discourse that is established around \nmulticultural texts. Though it endorses the teaching of multicultural texts, it does so \noffering them as a foil to British heritage texts in order to consolidate, rather than \nchallenge, a sense of British identity. Thus such texts are seen, not only, as a source of \ndeveloping 'a broader range of thought and feeling', but also as a site of difference from \nwhich pupils will 'gain a better understanding of the cultural heritage of English \nliterature itself' (Cox 1991, 73), thus keeping intact the privileged \u201eus\u201f of heritage texts \nover the \u201eother\u201f of multicultural texts.  \nPrescribed authors in the National Curriculum \nThe Cox Report, then, implies that the \u201eright\u201f sort of literature fosters \u201eintelligence \nand sensibility\u201f (Cox 1991, 75), develops students\u201f moral judgement, social \nengagement and national identity and conversely that the \u201ewrong\u201f sort of literature (the \ntype George Eliot dubs \u201espiritual gin\u201f (Eliot, 1879\/1973, 94)), blunts intelligence and \nmoral reasoning. This perspective, bound up as it is with the Victorian view of \nliterature, has exerted a powerful influence on educational policy for the last two \ndecades. Notably, it provided the terms of discourse that led to the institution of a \ngovernment approved prescribed list of authors in 1993. Thus, from its inception the \nNational Curriculum set its store by a large number of British authors. Thereafter, under \nsuccessive governments, the English curriculum has become increasingly prescriptive \nand increasingly entrenched the association between literature, moral reasoning and \nnational identity. The revisions to the curriculum in 1995, although according to Kress \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n13 \n \nlittle more than general tidying up (cf. Kress et al 2005), continued in this vein. In 1999, \nthe curriculum\u201fs incorporation of citizenship from 2002 (DfEE 1999) consolidated this \nassociation further. Once again, there was a move to draw a distinction between \nBritain\u201fs rich cultural heritage and multicultural, \u201epopular\u201f writing, and thus a \nweighting of the curriculum in favour of traditional British writers. Over the last few \nyears, this perspective has been given further urgency by concerns about social \nfragmentation bound up with youth crime, debate over immigration, the UK's place in \nthe European Union and threats from home-grown Islamic terrorism. In light of this, \nliterature has been regularly posited as a site that might 'play a key role in creating \ncommunity cohesion' (BBC 2007a). Since 2006, Education Secretary Alan Johnson has \nbrought to bear a particularly fundamentalist perspective on this issue. In a direct echo \nof the Victorian position, he has consistently proposed a correlation between doing \nmore to strengthen the curriculum and promoting 'British values' of tolerance and \nrespect (Sylvester and Thomson, 2007). \nJohnson's impact has been dramatic, not least because his tenure as Education \nSecretary has coincided with a number of initiatives that promised to push educational \npolicy in a more progressive direction. Instead, Johnson has presided over a series of \nregressions, illustrated most recently by the English 21 debacle. English 21 had been \nlaunched in 2004 as a 'national conversation' about \u201ehow English should be taught\u201f in \nschools (National Literacy Trust 2008). The English 21 'conversation' involved 5,000 \nteachers, parents, pupils, employers, employees, writers, literary organisations, local \nauthorities and others (QCA, 2005). English 21 considered what 'heritage' means in our \nmulti-ethnic, multicultural society (Willetts 2007) and, in light of this, what kind of \ncurriculum might need to be fostered for the future. Among the conclusions of English \n21 were that literary heritage should not be seen as a static and fixed list of texts, and \nthat literary heritage must be constantly revised to include texts from diverse traditions \n(QCA 2005, 8). Following this, the QCA recommended that texts should not be \nprescribed (with the exception of Shakespeare) in its new draft KS3 English \ncurriculum, simply stating that pupils should be taught stories, poetry and drama from \nbefore, during and after the twentieth century (National Literacy Trust 2008).  \nHowever, although the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority recommended \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n14 \n \nremoving the list of prescribed authors, in 2006 Johnson overruled this decision and \nannounced that authors including Trollope, Dickens and Austen, would be a feature of \nthe curriculum for 11\u201314 year olds (National Literacy Trust 2008). In conjunction with \nthis, in an act of extraordinarily constrained thinking, he argued that \u201ethere were certain \nuntouchable elements of the secondary school curriculum that all teenagers should \nlearn for a classic well-rounded British education\u201f (Johnson in Garner 2007). Thus, the \nnew National Curriculum in 2007 was for Johnson, a curriculum in which there was a \nsynoptic link between protecting \u201ethe classic canon of literature\u201f and meeting the \nchallenges of a \u201erapidly changing world\u201f (Johnson in BBC 2007b).  \nJohnson's roughshod treatment of less conservative perspectives than his own did \nnot go unchallenged. Sir Mike Tomlinson, a former schools chief inspector and QCA \nboard member, described the U-turn over prescribed texts as 'very sad' (Tomlinson in \nBrettingham 2007). Simon Gibbons, chair of the relevant committee at the National \nAssociation for the Teaching of English, said the idea of giving 'huge weighty tomes to \nkey stage 3 pupils\u201f was a \u201enonsense' and that the list smacked of superficiality: 'it reads \nlike a desert island discs of the Labour Cabinet' (Gibbons in Brettingham 2007). Others \nwere more curt. Ian McNeilly of the national association for the teaching of English, \nfor example, branded Johnson a 'bird brain' (McNeilly in BBC 2007c). Following this \nbacklash, teachers widely campaigned for non-compliance claiming that they would \nignore the instruction to teach Dickens and Austen to key stage 3 pupils or get round the \ndiktat by using textual extracts (Marshall in Brettingham 2007). The perversity of \nJohnson's new list was made most explicit by Ian Brinton, chair of the English \nAssociation's secondary committee, who noted that less than a third of the listed \nauthors, including Austen and Eliot, had ever previously been taught before year 9 \n(Brinton in Brettingham 2007). \nIt is instructive here to reflect upon the manner in which Johnson himself appears \nto have been interpellated by British culture, as Johnson\u201fs regard for the shibboleths of \nBritish literature runs parallel with a nostalgia for the British class system. Reviewing a \nrecent interview, we see Johnson's simultaneous pride in drawing attention to his \nworking-class past (which involved leaving school at 15, working as a postman and \nbringing up three children on a council estate) and in championing the achievements of \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n15 \n \nruling class culture. As such, Johnson, not only holds in tension the contradictions of \n\u201eNew\u201f Labour, he also embodies the process, and logic, via which those who apparently \noppose hegemony can, in fact, enforce it. Stressing his working-class credentials and \ncelebrating the past triumphs of the middle-class are equally important for Johnson \nbecause both these things ultimately validate his own subjectivity. Via the history he \nhas lived, and been a part, he is able to celebrate his own place in the grand scheme of \nthings. This is all very well for Johnson. Alarmingly, however, when applied to the \neducational context, this perspective leads to proposing the solution to problems of \nunder-privilege and deprivation, not by fostering democracy, but by more widely \ncirculating ruling-class culture so that all children are absorbed into its traditions. As an \ninstance of this, we might note how Johnson argues for the manner in which education \nmight provide the means of throwing off the 'shackles' of disadvantage: \u201eIt's not that too \nmany middle-class parents are giving their children ballet and music lessons, I want \npoor children to have the same' (Sylvester and Thomson 2007).  \nConcerns about prescribed texts  \nThe policy decisions of recent governments although consistent have, then, been \nbased on a very partisan attitude. The discourse is underpinned by hegemony, \nessentialism and ethnocentricity. Furthermore, the hegemonic logic has become \nbound-up with a discourse of common sense and assumptions about literature's moral \npower that mask some of its more troubling implications. In the following sections of \nthis article, we turn our attention to concerns about the implications of prescribing \nauthors. We also draw upon evidence from the classroom to explore the consequence of \nusing literature for moral and social purposes. On this topic, it is instructive to begin the \nnext section of this article by returning to the views of the chairman of the Cox Report \npanel, Brian Cox, and to note that he has become one of the most vocal critics of the \ngovernment's canon in recent years. In 1995, for instance, noting what he considered to \nbe the distortion and misuse of the Cox Report's recommendations, Cox charged that \nthe National Curriculum had been taken over by \u201ea small right-wing pressure group\u201f \n(Cox 1995, 23) and that decisions, such as the inclusion of a large number of British \nauthors in the revised curriculum at the expense of multicultural texts, were based on a \nracist \u201edistrust of non-white writers\u201f (Cox 1995, 94). In addition to this, he went on to \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n16 \n \ncondemn the use of literature to \u201eimpose a national state identity on children\u201f (Cox \n1995, 180) and argued instead for a more democratic approach in which teachers would \n'choose representative texts for study in the classroom which reflect a whole range of \ncultures, classes, languages and genders' (Cox 1995, 180) and thereby allow ethnic and \nclass self-expression. \nAlthough Cox does not propose any radical challenge to the government\u201fs policy, \nhis perspective is a useful point of departure, as from it we might move to further \nproblematise the government approved discourse. In this respect, we might note how it \nis a commonplace in contemporary literary theory to position literature as a culturally \nsituated practice constructed through the historical activity of reading and writing. In \naddition, we might then turn to consider how literary value, itself, is often understood to \nbe a construct rather than an objective category which will only tell us what \u201eis valued \nby certain people in specific situations, according to particular criteria and in the light \nof given purposes\u201f (Eagleton 1996, 10). Under this perspective, the belief system of the \ninterpreter is central to meaning-making and indeed this belief system itself might be \nconsidered little more than a reflection of the perceived values and norms of a given \nsocial context. Thus we are led not to a-historical and non-value laden judgements but \ninstead to an acknowledgement of the contentious issue of the political interests with \nwhich literary texts may be said to collude. In light of such a critical perspective, we \nwould now like to re-examine some of the arguments that underpin the prescription of \nauthors. \nHere, we can observe how the argument for the promotion of moral welfare or \ncharacter education through literature (Bohlin 2005, 18), immediately takes on an \nuncomfortable tone, as the idea of being taught by great literature now slips into an \nargument for literature as a form of social engineering. Put crudely, literature becomes \ncast as a technology through which subjects may be programmed (Owens 1992, 107). \nThe notion that we can use literature to form citizens and create stability, furthermore, \nallows social problems to be displaced from their most obvious terms of reference, that \nis, they can be cast as having their origin in cultural rather than economic factors. In this \nregard, arguing for the moral benefits that result from exposure to certain types of \nliterature might be seen as part of an exercise with hegemonic intent, where the \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n17 \n \nnormalisation of middle-class taste stands in for confronting social and economic \ninequity. The danger here is made explicit by returning to Bohlin, who argues that \nexposure to good literature is of particular benefit for pupils from deprived \nbackgrounds: \nSociology has demonstrated this truth time and time again; the experience \nof a child born into extreme poverty and neglect seriously limits his or her \nability to develop virtuous dispositions. (Bohlin 2005, 33)  \n Similar problems also emerge with arguments for using literature to promote \nnational identity and social cohesion. Here, we might reflect that the term \u201enational\u201f has \nits origins in Europe no earlier than the nineteenth century,\u201f (Meek 2001, viii), that \nthere is no definable \u201eessence\u201f to nationality (Eaglestone 2000, 104), and that the term \nnational identity is therefore, at best, an unstable construct. National identity, indeed, \nonly comes into being by being worked at to establish a sense of who we are as a people, \ndistinct from other people around the world. Following through the logic of this, a \nsystem of national literature is also revealed as a construct determined by usage and \ngiven authority through repetition, with the canonisation of certain works and the \nhierarchy established around these works only reinforced through the circulation of \nhistorical accounts of texts in given social contexts. There is thus a large element of \nself-fulfilling prophecy about the argument for literature and national identity. As Homi \nBhabha (1990) identifies, while written language may support and transmit culture, this \nact of transmission perpetuates and ultimately forms the culture itself. By stating, for \nexample, that Shakespeare has contributed to British culture and treating his works as \ncultural artefacts, people with cultural authority both affirm their authority to know \nwhat is of cultural value and make what they value the nation\u201fs culture. Texts that are \nused to promote national identity are thus credited, in a circular process, with a cultural \nimportance that appears to be confirmed by their enduring social relevance. The image \nof cultural authority thus composes its own powerful image (cf. Bhabha 1990, 3), and is \ngiven authority not because of its authentic quality but because it is readily bound up \nwith a national myth. \nThe classroom \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n18 \n \nThe idea of great literature as a source of moral welfare and social cohesion might \nbe imagined to meet with some redress in the classroom where theoretical \nconsiderations regarding notions of the canon must be reconciled with actual \ncircumstance. Here, however, the attitude towards a prescribed list of authors is, itself, \noften bound up with pragmatism. Children, after all, the argument goes, cannot possibly \nstudy all literature, and 'something' therefore must be taught (Kermode, 1988). On these \nterms, Fleming (2007) argues 'there is a natural tendency amongst teachers to develop a \nset of recognised texts irrespective of whether these are dictated externally' (Fleming \n2007, 32) and therefore that in the absence of an officially sanctioned canon, a de facto \ncanon will emerge determined by factors such as availability, local fashion, teacher \npreference and, even, deference to authority. Under this view, canon formation is \npresented as a 'natural human instinct' via which order is imposed upon variety by \nchoosing 'what is best for preservation over time' (Fleming 2007, 34). From this view, a \nstrong argument might be made that 'canon formation should happen in a . . . systematic \nway' (Fleming 2007, 34) and against the kind of relativism that the absence of a canon \nproduces. The alternative to the canon, after all, appears to present inherent difficulties. \nOn the one hand, it presents problems with standards and equivalence between \nclassrooms and, on the other, it renders literature an open-ended category amid which \nteachers are faced with unrealistic choices, regress or inertia. A pragmatic view also \nallows the logic of those who argue against the canon to be folded back upon itself: as \nwe note that even if substituting one set of books for another, whatever is displaced will \nbe simply replaced by an alternative which will invariably reflect someone's interests \n(Kermode, 1988).  \nFor teachers, pragmatism is though, of course, not the whole story. More complex \nconsiderations are in play and here we might observe the tension between those who \nthrough their practice embody the government approved discourse and those who resist \nit. In this respect, first of all, we find the official discourse which binds together ideas \nabout literature, moral welfare and social cohesion certainly has its advocates. In their \nstudy of English in the urban classroom, for example, Kress et al (2005, 7) found that \nteachers in a school \u201esituated in an area with a significant Black population that is \ncharacterised by social deprivation\u201f welcomed the teaching of canonical authors such \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n19 \n \nas Shakespeare as part of their pupils\u201f democratic entitlement. Conflating the term 'the \nbest' with the mantra of equal opportunities, they expressed the opinion that \nworking-class and black students have \u201ea right of access' to certain literature because it \nis deemed to hold cultural capital (Kress et al 2005, 153). On these terms, we find the \ngovernment's hegemonic view of literature ironically given urgency by notions of \negalitarianism, with some teachers even making the circular argument that schools have \na responsibility to introduce young people to the writing which is considered \nparticularly worthy of study without any apparent acknowledgement of the false logic, \nor the contentiousness, that this view invokes (Kress et al 2005, 150).      \nFor the counter view, we can though turn to the many teachers for whom there is \nunease about fostering a deferential relationship to literary texts. Such teachers express \na wariness of privileging the socially and historically determined curricula and \ninstitutional practices of western middle-class culture; and sense in the material \nconditions of the classroom an opportunity to foster alternative practices and politics \n(cf. Ward 2006). These teachers position learning as a social process based upon \nencounter between the experiences of pupils and curricula and seek opportunities to \nharness the pupils\u201f subjectivity and personal experience as a means of interrogating \ncultural formations. Under such approaches, social concerns eclipse textual authority \nand the act of reading is privileged over the literary artefact. These teachers thus might \nseek to generate debate that interrogates the subject position and political interests \nfostered by a given text, or seek to engage students\u201f interest in moral dilemmas and \nsocial practices with literature providing 'a springboard to classroom discussion' (Ward \n2006, 42). Alternatively, this process may be reversed so that a text is employed \nretrospectively as an adjunct to pedagogy or means of illuminating an issue. As \nWilliams identifies this is an approach which has increasing currency: \nIn the past, I have taught Pride and Prejudice to a GCSE class. We used \nclass time to discuss the position of women in society, class differences in \nAusten\u201fs time and the significance of marriage. Now, I am encouraged to \nstart with the issues I wish to cover and work back to find appropriate texts. \nThe difference is subtle but significant. English changes from being about \nthe immersion in a great literary work that may or may not raise interesting \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n20 \n \npoints for discussion to a lesson on values and issues in which literary \nexamples are mere illustrations. (Williams 2005) \nIn the classroom, such teachers use texts critically in practice with their approaches \nreflecting the view that texts should be interrogated rather than simply read out of \nrespect for their place in literary history. Alternatively, these teachers might foreground \nthe social aspects of texts, or even abandon texts altogether if students\u201f subject \npositions render these texts excessively complex or obscure (Ward 2006, 48).  \nThe curriculum\u201fs focus on heritage texts and notions about social cohesion meet \nwith similarly diverse practices in the classroom. Kress et al (2005), once again, show \nthat there is support among some teachers for placing emphasis on British heritage \ntexts. For these teachers, teaching British heritage texts is attractive, primarily, because \ndoing so is less problematic than attempting to appeal to pupils\u201f multiple and \nirreconcilable cultural experiences - a view that is once again validated by notions of \negalitarianism and ideas about access for all (see Kress et al 2005). Other teachers, \nhowever, resist the notion of seeking to transmit heritage, arguing that doing so posits \nthe classroom as a site outside of everyday experience where something other, rather \nthan immediate, called Englishness is encountered and fostered (Kress et al 2005, 147). \nThis casting of literature as a site of difference is, for many teachers, a cause for \nconcern. Once again, as Ward (2006) demonstrates, these teachers reject the use of \nliterature as a means of homogenising taste and developing national identity and are \nmore at ease with a multicultural agenda. In this respect, they conceive of the classroom \nas a site of exchange rather than indoctrination.  \nThe practices concerning how texts are used and\/or read may appear to \ndestabilise the idea of canonical authority. The material conditions of the classroom, \nwhose transactions involve the interplay of ideology with local circumstance, might \nseem to offer a site of complexity and involve situation-specific practices that create the \npossibility of resistance. However, although these transactions may imply a challenge \nto the curriculum's socially and historically determined assumptions, as long as the \nNational Curriculum is bound up with prescribed authors, they are instead turned to \nreaffirm its validity. In this regard, any critique of texts is absorbed by the curriculum \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n21 \n \nrather than recognised as a site of its dismantling, with the very act of engaging with the \ncanon serving to pay homage to it and reaffirm its power. From this, we get a sense of \nthe insidiousness of prescribed texts. Though the classroom may highlight the \nshortcomings of an ideologically imposed curriculum, the impact of prescribed authors \nis not destabilised by practice. The potential to conceive of tradition as a construct \nrather than truth, and shift emphasis from celebrating and perpetuating the past to \nanalysing why and what is celebrated and perpetuated, is not necessarily accomplished.  \nConclusion  \n\u2018Control of the National Curriculum can lead to control of the way children \n think\u2019 (Cox 1995, 23). \nThe idea of great literature as a source of moral welfare and social cohesion \ncontinues to exert a powerful influence on curriculum makers. Though we might \nimagine, or expect, the discourse concerning English literature to have become more \ncomplex in light of several decades of literary theory, this is not the case. Literary \ntheory rather remains relativised in secondary education policy-making by being cast as \noppositional to great literature rather than centrally engaged with its nature and effects. \nPerhaps this should present no surprise, as ideas about great literature are often \nconflated both with a discourse of common sense and\/or the mantra of equal \nopportunities - the sleight of hand in a hegemonic system being run together with the \nidea of access for all going unnoticed. On this basis, the state control of education, \nbegun in the 1980s, has continued to dominate English literature's place in schools with \nthe Victorian view of literature providing the basis for the centralization of powers and \nthe prescription of curriculum content.  \nWe might take issue with this on a number of counts. First, we might note the \ninsidiousness of how the version of the nation reflected in the National Curriculum is \nmaintained by silencing many of the nation's constituent voices, or alternatively, as Ken \nJones identifies, how though 'claiming its relevance to all students, it in fact neglects the \nspecific conditions of their lives and the interests which motivate their learning' (Jones \n1992, 127-128). On these terms, prescribed authors in the curriculum are a force that \nLet them eat Shakespeare: prescribed authors and the National Curriculum  \n \n22 \n \nacts against both democracy and the development of critical citizenship. Beyond this, \nwe might take issue with the hegemony implicit in a view which proposes culture and \nits textual artefacts as a natural set of given traits, conditions and lineages, as such a \nview closes down the interrogation of how official knowledge is normalized and \nreproduced into the legitimate currency in everyday social life (cf. Grierson 2007, 540). \nIn light of this, it is helpful to remind ourselves of some questions posed by Henry \nGiroux:  \n . . . how do we make education meaningful by making it critical, and how do \nwe make it critical so as to make it emancipatory? (Giroux 1983, 3)  \n. . . [how do we appropriate] the critical impulse so as to lay bare the distinction \nbetween reality and the conditions that conceal its possibilities? (Giroux 1983, \n242) \nWe might start by observing that the classroom must be a site that illuminates not \nonly the value of literary traditions but also their limitations and thus makes possible \nand promotes continual engagement with other modes of experience. A move away \nfrom prescribed authors is essential to facilitating this and to the development of a \nclassroom where, rather than pay homage to the dominant culture, a critical attitude \ntowards forms of domination is instead fostered.   \n \n \n \n \n \nReferences:  \nArnold, M. 1882\/2006.
