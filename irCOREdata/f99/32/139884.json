The application of heat or applied stress allows the \nrecovery of the intermetallic alloy through a reversible thermo-elastic phase \ntransformation without long-range diffusion or a change in composition. NiTi can \ntransform from a low temperature, low allotrope martensite B19\u2019 phase to a high \ntemperature, high-symmetry allotrope austenite B2 phase, upon the application of heat \nor applied stress. There is very little volume change in the transformations, but the \nlattice change between the high temperature body-centered cubic phase and the low \ntemperature, ordered monoclinic phase involves a large local shear strain. In NiTi, \nthis phase transformation takes place at temperatures below 373K and has generated a \nnumber of studies on NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA) thin films in an array of novel \napplications ranging from medical applications[1] to micro-actuators [2-4]. However, \nas the phase transformation temperatures are below 373K [5,6], the range of \napplications where NiTi could be applied is limited to below this temperature. \nThere are another group of ternary SMA materials in the NiTiX group, where X are \nsubstitutional solutions of Hf, Zr, Au, Pd or Pt, which have aroused interest as future \nSMAs materials that have phase transformation temperatures that are greater than \n373K [7], and therefore could be utilised in high temperature micro actuator \napplications such as those experienced in a gas turbine [8]. Substitutions of an \nadditional element of Hf [9], Pd [10] and Pt [11] have proved effective at increasing \nphase transformation temperatures above 773K [12]. However, the material costs \nassociated, in particular, with the inclusion of Pt and Pd metals have limited \napplications to niche markets [10]. The addition of Hf in a NiTiX material system has \nbeen particularly important as an alternative high-temperature SMA because of its \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nlow cost, its performance at modest doping levels [7]and high transformation \ntemperatures [12,13], opening up the possibility of a wider range of high temperature \napplications. The NiTiHf material system has an additional advantage of being more \nstable than NiTi during thermal cycling and stable during high temperature aging [7]. \nThe underlying process route for the deposition of SMA materials as a coating has \nbeen either RF [14]or conventional DC sputtering [12]. Recent advances in pulse DC \nsputtering have proven to produce greater plasma densities [15,16] leading to higher \nionisation of the sputtered materials. The resulting films produced are denser than \nthose films produced by conventional sputtering routes [17]. \nThe complex behaviour of SMAs show that they are very sensitive to an array of \nphysical factors such as alloy composition, lattice defects, microstructure and intrinsic \nstresses [7]. Pulse DC sputtering thus offers an opportunity to overcome and deposit \nSMA coatings that minimise the effects of defects, stress and other microstructural \neffects that impact SMA phase transformation. In fact it has been determined that \nthere are stark differences in the response of stress-strain behaviour caused by internal \nstress due to Ti3Ni4 precipitates [18].  \nThe aim of this study is to co-sputter NiTi, Ti and Hf using pulse DC sputtering and \ncharacterise the resulting NiTi and NiTiHf coatings. An understanding and the control \nof the film composition and its impact on phase transformations is a critical first step. \nThe coatings are characterised for their phase transformation properties using a \ndifferential scanning calorimeter, (DSC), and their physical recovery properties \ninterrogated with a 1 to 5 N load applied using a conventional scratch tester.  \n2.0 Experimental \nAll research work is undertaken in a Leybold L560\u00ae coater equipped with two 3-inch \n(75mm) magnetrons. The system is turbo-pumped to base pressure better than 10-7 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nTorr. The NiTi target is supplied by Teer Coatings [19] and is a NiTi intermetallic \nalloy of 50:50 at% (55:45 NiTi wt%). The Hf target is provided by Pi-Kem [20] with \na quoted purity of 99.95%. Silicon (100) wafers are used as substrates in this study. \nAll coatings were deposited at room temperature. For deposition, argon is used as the \nprocess gas at a pressure of 10mTorr and the target-substrate distance is kept constant \nat 7cm. Power to the magnetrons is supplied by an Advanced Energy\u00ae pulsed DC \npower supply, set at a pulse frequency of 200kHz and a rate of 1.6\u00b5s.  \nSMA coatings with a thickness of 3 micrometers, measured with a Dectac, are \nproduced. The compositions of the coatings are measured using energy dispersive X-\nray spectroscopy, and the crystallinity of the coatings is conducted using XRD \nequipped with a Cu source. \nTwo sets of coatings are produced; one set is used for scratch testing, while the other \nset are removed from the silicon substrate leaving freestanding films, which are \nrequired for DSC analysis. \nA Setaram Setsys Evolution 16\/18 DSC, equipped with Setsoft 2000 software, is \nemployed to evaluate the phase transformation temperatures of the intermetallic \ncoatings. The thin films are annealed using the DSC at 1100oC, then 550oC at 5oC\/min \nheating and cooling rates. \nMechanical indentation of the coatings is undertaken in order to investigate their \nrecovery properties. A Teer Coatings scratch tester equipped with a 5mm spherical tip \nis used to load the coatings, with loads increasing from 1 to 5 N. All mechanical \nindentation studies are undertaken at room temperature. \n3.0 Results and discussion \n3.1 The NiTi target \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nAn off-cut from a NiTi target material evoked a DSC response when it was annealed \nin the DSC to 1100oC for 1 hour followed by 550oC for 5 hours. Similarly, the \ncoatings showed a DSC response when they underwent the same heating cycle as the \noff-cut. Lower temperature anneals were not successful in producing a DSC response \nand thus it was decided that all coatings would undergo a high-temperature, 1100oC \nanneal, followed by a low-temperature, 500oC anneal.  \nThe off-cut piece of the target material was heated to 1100oC for 1 hour followed by \n550oC for 5 hours in a DSC and then cycled from 20 to 200oC. Clear austenite peak, \nAp, and martensite peak, Mp, phases were present at 100 and 60oC, respectively, with \ncorresponding phase transformation enthalpies of 12.5 and -7.2 J\/g for Ap and Mp, \nsuggesting that the target material has the potential to produce coatings with SMA \ncharacteristics. Additional DSC cycling from 20 to 200oC was undertaken and the \nresults are summarised in table I. The first cycle of the thermal response from a NiTi \noff-cut is shown in figure 1. \n3.2 NiTi and NiTiHf compositions by sputter deposition \nThe difference in the sputtering yields of the Ni and the Ti, [21] from the NiTi alloy \ntarget resulted in coatings that were approximately 5 at% Ti deficient. This Ti \ndeficiency from the nominally supplied target has been reported by other studies [7]. \nCompensation for the loss of Ti usually takes place by either placing pure Ti discs on \nthe surface of the sputter target [7] or by co-sputtering [12]. If the Ti depletion is not \ncompensated for during growth, studies have found that Ti deficiency results in phase \ntransformation temperatures below room temperature [14]. Thus, in this work co-\nsputtering NiTi with Ti compensated for Ti depletion. Varying the power to the Ti \ntarget controlled the composition of the coating produced, and Ti compositions \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nranging from 45 to 65 at% Ti were deposited. Table II summarises the coatings \ndeposited in this study by co-sputtering NiTi with Ti. \nDuring the fabrication of the NiTiHf coatings, circular (1cm diameter) pure Ti discs \nwere placed in the erosion track of the NiTi target to control the film stoichiometry \nand to compensate for the loss of Ti, and was co-sputtered with Hf. By varying the \npower to the Hf target, compositions of Hf ranging from 2 to 30 at% Hf were \ndeposited. Table III shows the results from the experiments conducted by co-\nsputtering NiTi with Hf. \n3.3 XRD analysis \nFigure 2 shows the XRD spectra of the NiTi films, over a 2\u03b8 of 35 to 60o, before and \nafter annealing. The films are not heated during deposition and the as-deposited films \nshow a broad XRD peak with no texturing, suggesting an amorphous structure [22]. \nHeat treatment of the film at 1100oC for 1 hour followed by a low temperature 550oC \nfor 5 hours is sufficient to crystallise the film and results in two major phases \nbecoming present at room temperature. The first major peak at a 2\u03b8 of 41o is the \nmonoclinic \u2013(111) peak due to martensite [14]. The other major 2\u03b8 peak at 43o is the \nmartensite B19\u2019 (020) reflection [14,22,23]. The martensite (012) reflection is present \nat a 2\u03b8 of 44o  [23]. It is to be expected that the martensite phase be dominant at room \ntemperature and only diminish as the sample is heated. At higher temperatures, the \naustenite (110) cubic phase dominates at a 2\u03b8 of 42o. In fact, studies by Uchil et al. \n[23] and Pattabi et al, [24] have followed the evolution of the austenite (110) phase by \nutilising a heated stage fitted to their XRD instrument. Uchil et al, [23] have \ninterrogated the area under the austenite (110) peak as a means to elucidate the phase \ntransformation and have concluded that this method is far more sensitive in measuring \nsmaller volume fractions that undergo phase transformations, than that determined by \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nroutine thermal DSC analysis. Unfortunately, it was not possible to access in this \nstudy and thus only room temperature XRD data and DSC analysis could be used for \nphase transformation behaviour. Further analysis of the XRD spectra was undertaken \nto determine the presence of precipitates formed by excess nickel or titanium. The \nXRD spectrum of the annealed NiTi film in figure 2 shows a number of peaks \nbetween 42 and 46o suggesting the presence of nickel rich precipitates. Excess nickel, \nfor example, forms Ni3Ti [25], Ni3Ti2 [25] and\/or Ni4Ti3 [14,14] at high temperatures, \nand the associated XRD peaks are to be found at approximate 2\u03b8 values of 39o, 43o, \n47o, 52o and 73o [25]. Excess titanium shows the presence of a (115) reflection due to \nTi2Ni at a 2\u03b8 of approximately 41o, and this could be present in the shoulder of our \u2013\n(111) peak. As these peaks are relatively small compared with our martensite and \naustenite peaks, it is thought that the combination of pulse DC sputtering and our high \ntemperature 1100oC anneals used are sufficient to disperse these precipitates. XRD \npeaks associated with excess titanium forming TiO2 in either an anatase or rutile \nphase [26]was within the background noise of our XRD spectrum and therefore need \nnot be discussed further. \nFigure 3 shows the XRD spectrum for the as-deposited NiTiHf thin film, showing a \nbroad, low intensity XRD pattern at room temperature, indicating an amorphous \nstructure. After annealing, peaks relating to the martensite -(111) and (101) appear. \nHowever, additional martensite peaks of (022), (020), (110) and (011) as identified by \nTong et al., [9] are not present in these films. These differences could be associated \nwith the processing involved as Tong et al., [9] employed rapid thermal annealing for \n25 s as an alternative route to crystallise their NiTiHf films. \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n3.4 DSC analysis \nFor the phase transformation studies, the NiTi and the NiTiHf films were peeled from \nthe silicon substrates so as to obtain phase transformation measurements without any \nstress [14]. Both the NiTi and NiTiHf samples were heated at a rate of 10oC\/min using \nthe DSC. The samples, in the case of the NiTi films were cycled from 20 to 200oC \nand 20 to 500oC for the NiTiHf films, in order to determine the phase transformation \ncharacteristics. \n3.4.1The NiTi films \nFigure 4 shows the first heating and cooling cycle of the NiTi film containing 52 at% \nTi. An additional 3 cycles was performed on this sample to verify reproducibility and \nthe results of the phase transformations and the resulting enthalpies are shown in table \nIV. From the first cycle, we see that the peak of the phase transformation occurs at \n107oC and 68oC for the austenite and martensite phase transformations, respectively. \nThis hysteresis of 40oC in the thin films reflects the hysteresis observed for the target \nmaterial. For subsequent cycles in the NiTi film, the hysteresis falls to approximately \n35oC, again reflecting the characteristics of the target. The enthalpies for both the \naustenite and martensite phase transformations are higher in relative values when \ncompared with the enthalpies calculated for the NiTi target material. The higher \nenthalpy values in the films indicate a greater portion of the film underwent a phase \ntransformation than it did in the target material, another effect of the film being denser \ndue to pulse DC sputtering and having fewer defects. A study by Botterill et al, [27] \nshows a similar temperature hysteresis for their NiTi films containing 52.5 at% Ti.  \nThe NiTi film containing 65 at% Ti also underwent cyclic testing in the DSC from 20 \nto 200oC. From the results, which are summarised in table V, the first cycle shows a \nphase transformation at 103oC and 66oC for the austenite and martensite phases, \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nrespectively. The hysteresis is around 40oC, but the only difference between this film \nand the film containing 52 at% Ti is the difference in phase transformation enthalpies. \nThey are smaller in value than the film containing 52 at% Ti and they are smaller in \nvalue than for the NiTi target. Thus, this seems to suggest that although NiTi shows \nSMA characteristics at 65 at% Ti, less of the material undergoes phase transformation \nthan NiTi containing 52 at% Ti. This high saturation of the Ti in the NiTi matrix \nresults in the excess Ti forming Ti2Ni [28] precipitates congregating at columnar-\ngrain interface, impeding phase transformations, and thus offering some explanation \nof the low phase transformation enthalpies in this film compared with the target. \n3.4.2 NiTiHf \nA summary of the results associated with the NiTiHf thin films can be found in table \nVI. Samples with IDs L15 and N15, with compositions of 2 and 10 at% Hf, \nrespectively, showed no phase transformations above room temperature.  \nStudies by Sanjabi et al, [12] and Grummon et al, [7] show that initial doping with Hf \nless than 5 at% lowers martensite start temperatures (MS), to below 20oC. The DSC \nused for this study does not have a cold-stage and thus cannot measure temperatures \nbelow 20oC. For sample N15 whose composition was above 5 at% Ti, according to \nestablished results, we should expect to see a phase transformation above 20oC. The \nHf occupies the Ti site via direct substitution of the Ti atoms [7] and looking at the \nTi(50-X)HfX composition portion of N15, we note that the sum of these are below the \n50 at% Ti threshold required to observe phase transformations above room \ntemperature [14]. \nWith Hf additions greater than 20 at%, experimental results show that transformation \ntemperatures increase significantly above 300oC [12]. In this study, the NiTiHf \ncoating with 30 at% Hf shows a two-stage austenite phase transformation upon \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nheating and a single martensite phase transformation upon cooling. The additional \ntransformation in the austenite phase has been termed the \u2018R\u2019 phase and is an \nintermediate rhombohedral phase between the martensitic B19\u2019 phase and the \naustenitic B2 phase [12]. Other studies have also shown that films containing Hf \ngreater than 16 at%, display this intermediate \u2018R\u2019 phase [7]. Basically the \u2018R\u2019 phase \noccurs because of the build up of internal stresses and the depletion of Ni in the \nmatrix. TEM studies have shown that the R-phase transformation seems to nucleate \naround precipitates of Ti3Ni4 and provide a lower energy alternative to the martensite \nphase transformation [29]. The driving force behind multiple stage transformation \nbehaviour have been proposed [30-32]however the most widely accepted view now is \nthat the precipitates are distributed inhomogeneously [31], resulting is localised phase \ntransformations separate from the rest of the matrix. Thus, the phase transformation \ndoes not occur and propagate through the entire material, but occurs in localised \nportions of the material, resulting in multiple transformation peaks [30,31].    \nFurther, the transformation temperature in the coating with 30 at% Hf is around \n150oC, well below the transformation temperature that would be predicted using the \nresults from Sanjabi et al, [12] for a similar composition of coating. The reason for \nsuch a large discrepancy is the difference in stoichiometry between the two studies; \nSanjabi\u2019s coatings were stoichiometric NiTiHf, whereas the coating with 30 at% Hf \ndeposited in this study was off-stoichiometry. This shows the versatility of the NiTiHf \n\u2018process window\u2019 over which NiTiHf can be compositionally engineered for a \nparticular application at the expense of its phase transformation temperature. \nSanjabi et al, [12] showed that in the case of NiTiHf coatings, the annealing \ntemperature was a function of Hf composition, requiring a crystallisation temperature \nof around 500oC. In this study it was found that this temperature did not produce any \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nvisible phase transformation in the coating. Much higher temperatures were required. \nThe reason for this discrepancy is not clear at this moment, the differences between \nthe two studies were that Sanjabi et al [12] used DC sputtering, whereas this study \nused the higher energy pulsed DC process. Furthermore, Sanjabi\u2019s coatings were near \nstoichiometric whereas the coatings produced in this study were off-stoichiometric (Ti \nand Hf) rich. Further work using rapid thermal annealing (RTA) is currently \nunderway as an alternative route to crystallise the coatings. \n3.5 Mechanical Testing \nBoth the NiTi and the NiTiHf films were mechanically tested for their recovery \nproperties using scratch testing with a ball indenter at loads ranging from 1 to 5N. The \nvertical displacements were measured and the resulting, \u2018final\u2019 displacement \ncalculated. The difference between the vertical displacements caused by the initial \nindentation compared with the vertical displacement when the load was removed was \ntermed the permanent \u2018deformation\u2019 of the material. \nA typical plot of the vertical displacement of a SMA coating versus the load applied is \nshown in figure 5.  The deformation of both the NiTi and NiTiHf coatings fabricated \nin this study are summarised in table VII. For the coating containing 52 at% Ti, a load \nof 1N results a vertical displacement of 7.5\u00b5m and increasing the load to a maximum \nof 5N results in a vertical displacement of 17\u00b5m. When the load is removed from the \nsample, the coating recovers to a degree, which results in a permanent deformation of \n10.5\u00b5m. We see that as the Ti content is increased to 65 at% Ti, the deformation \nincreases to 30\u00b5m, 3 times larger than the film containing 52 at% Ti. Similarly for the \nHf-containing films, we observe that increasing Hf content in the film results in an \nalmost doubling of the film deformation.  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n4.0 Conclusions \n\u2022 Pulse DC sputtering has been employed to fabricate NiTi and NiTiHf coatings \nonto silicon substrates. As deposited coatings are amorphous. Coating \ncompositions of NiTi containing 45 to 65 at% can be crystallised by a thermal \ntreatment. Removing the coatings from the silicon substrates and heating the \nfilms in a DSC at a temperature of 1100oC for 1 hour followed by 550oC for 5 \nhours, results in crystallisation. XRD reveals \u2013(111) and (020) martensite \npeaks at room temperature. \n\u2022 In the NiTi thin films, the endothermic austenite peak phase transformation \noccurs at around 105oC and the exothermic peak martensite phase \ntransformation occurs at 65oC, a hysteresis of 40oC. Phase transformation \nenthalpies of the NiTi containing 52 at% Ti were similar to those obtained for \nthe NiTi source material used to fabricate the coatings by pulsed DC \nsputtering. For the NiTi films containing 65 at% Ti phase transformation \nenthalpies were lower than those of the sputtering target, however, the \nhysteresis remained unchanged at 40oC. This is understood to be due to excess \nTi forming Ti2Ni precipitates within the \u2018as deposited\u2019 then heat-treated films. \nThus, although the stoichiometric \u2018process window\u2019 to produce a phase \ntransformation in NiTi SMAs is quite large, there is a trade-off in \ntransformation enthalpy, ie the amount of material that undergoes an austenite \nor martensite transformation, with transformation temperature. \n\u2022 Co-sputtering NiTi with Hf and varying the power to the Hf target from 15 to \n70W, NiTiHf films with Hf compositions ranging from 2 to 30 at% Hf have \nbeen fabricated. XRD reveals an amorphous as-grown film, which requires a \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n1100oC anneal for 1 hour to crystallise the film. XRD reveals martensitic -\n(111) and (020) planes after this heat treatment. \n\u2022 NiTiHf coatings with Hf contents of 2 and 10 at% show no visible phase \ntransformation above 20oC.  \n\u2022 DSC of the films containing 30 at% Hf has shown a \u2018R\u2019 phase transition, \nwhich occurs between the room temperature B19\u2019 phase and the high \ntemperature B2 phase. It is understood that this phase is present in films that \nhave high internal stresses and nucleate near Ti3Ni4 precipitates. Such \nprecipitates provide a low energy alternative by providing sites for nucleation. \nPrecipitates are distributed randomly throughout the matrix and therefore \ntransformations occur at distinct locations resulting in multiple peaks. \n\u2022 Measurements of the recovery properties of the films using a scratch tester \nwith a spherical indenter at loads ranging from 1 to 5N at room temperature \nshow that films containing 65 at% Ti are able to deform 3 times more than \nfilms containing 52 at% Ti. For the films containing Hf, increasing the Hf \ncomposition from 2 at% to 30 at%, doubled the deformation measured in the \nfilms. \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nReferences  \n1 P.
