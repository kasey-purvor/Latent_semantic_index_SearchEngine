INTRODUCTION\nProteins are linear heteropolymers: they are linear se-\nquences of monomers, each of which is one of twenty dif-\nferent types. Different proteins have different sequences of\namino acids. These differences allow proteins to perform the\nhuge range of tasks they do in living cells. But this does not\nmean that two proteins that do the same job necessarily have\nthe same sequence. For example, many organisms have en-\nzymes called adenylate kinases which perform essentially the\nsame job in the cytoplasm of each organism. But the amino\nacid sequences of adenylate kinases vary very widely, even\nthough they are all doing the same job in more-or-less the\nsame milieu. Below are the amino-acid sequences of the ade-\nnylate kinases of two prokaryotes.1 First that of Escherichia\ncoli,\nMRIILLGAPGAGKGTQAQFIMEKYGIPQISTGDMLRAAVKSGSELGKQAK\nDIMDAGKLVTDELVIALVKERIAQEDCRNGFLLDGFPRTIPQADAMKEAG\nINVDYVLEFDVPDELIVDRIVGRRVHAPSGRVYHVKFNPPKVEGKDDVTG\nEELTTRKDDQEETVRKRLVEYHQMTAPLIGYYSKEAEAGNTKYAKVDGTK\nPVAEVRADLEKILG,\nand second that of Vibrio cholerae,\nMRIILLGAPGAGKGTQAQFIMEKFGIPQISTGDMLRAAIKAGTELGKQAK\nAVIDAGQLVSDDIILGLIKERIAQADCEKGFLLDGFPRTIPQADGLKEMG\nINVDYVIEFDVADDVIVERMAGRRAHLPSGRTYHVVYNPPKVEGKDDVTG\nEDLVIREDDKEETVRARLNVYHTQTAPLIEYYGKEAAAGKTQYLKFDGTK\nQVSEVSADIAKALA,\nwhere the sequences are given as a sequence of the 1-letter\ncodes for the amino acids of which they are made. The first\namino acid is an M ~methionine!, the second is an R ~argin-\nine! and so on. The sequence is read as English text, from top\nleft to bottom right. See any molecular biology or biochem-\nistry textbook2\u20134 for an introduction to amino acids and pro-\nteins. Note that there are many differences between the se-\nquences! The amino-acid sequences of proteins are very\ndifferent while keeping the function. Also, we picked adeny-\nlate kinases only in order to have a concrete example; it is a\ngeneral property of proteins. The function of adenylate ki-\nnases is irrelevant to our discussion of stability, beyond the\nfact that they function as enzymes as monomers in solution\ninside cells. Here we will concentrate entirely on globular\nproteins, the proteins that exist in solution not embedded in\nmembranes.\nNow, the simplest thing to do when faced with this radi-\ncal difference in sequence without a corresponding differ-\nence in function is to ignore it. To assume that the two pro-\nteins interact and behave in a very similar manner. But do\nthey? As they both function as proteins inside the cytoplasm\nof bacteria they are both clearly soluble and do not stick toa!Electronic mail: r.sear@surrey.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS VOLUME 120, NUMBER 2 8 JANUARY 2004\n9980021-9606\/2004\/120(2)\/998\/8\/$22.00 \u00a9 2004 American Institute of Physics\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

However, this does\nnot mean that their solubilities, for example, are necessarily\nequal. Both their solubilities are sufficient to allow them to\nfunction but one may exceed the minimum solubility by a\nlarge margin and one by a small margin. It would be of\ninterest to know what these margins are and how they vary\nfrom protein to protein, not only because we wish to under-\nstand how proteins function and have evolved in vivo, but to\nhelp us process, purify, and crystallize proteins. If a protein\nis only marginally soluble in the conditions in vivo, then it\nmay aggregate when its environment ~salt concentrations,\ntemperature, etc.! are altered. We would like to understand\nand to be able to predict, the variability of properties, such as\nthe solubility, of proteins.\nWe will focus on the stability of solutions of proteins in\ntheir native state, i.e., we assume that the protein has folded\ninto its native state and remains there. Thus we consider only\nfolded proteins sticking together due to their surfaces attract-\ning each other, not proteins partially unfolding and then ag-\ngregating due to the hydrophobic regions of the protein ex-\nposed by unfolding, attracting each other. So, our proteins\nwill always be compact objects, more like colloidal particles\nthan conventional polymers. This allows us to avoid the\ncomplex problem of protein ~un!folding. Effectively, we as-\nsume that proteins such as the adenylate kinases of E . coli\nand V . cholerae differ only in their surfaces. Replacing one\nsurface amino acid in the chain by another then changes only\nthe surface and through that the protein\u2013protein interaction.\nIf a hydrophobic amino acid replaces a hydrophilic amino\nacid in a position on the chain where the chain is at the\nprotein\u2019s surface, then we expect the surface to become more\nsticky, which would tend to decrease the second virial coef-\nficient, whereas replacing a hydrophobic amino acid by a\nhydrophilic one should have the opposite effect. For simplic-\nity, instead of having 20 different types of amino acids at the\nsurface, we use a model whose surface is described by bits\nwhich have only two values: hydrophobic and hydrophilic.\nThis is a rather gross approximation, the amino acids vary\nwidely in size and some are charged, but we want the sim-\nplest possible model. The model is an extension of that con-\nsidered in Ref. 5. A protein molecule is modeled by a cube,\nwhose 6 faces interact with a short-ranged attraction, which\nis determined here by a sequence of nB bits. In Ref. 5 the\ninteraction between faces was taken to be a random variable;\nwe will discuss the differences between that model and the\nmore complex one considered here in the conclusion. A sche-\nmatic of the model is shown in Fig. 1.\nWe have talked of our model proteins being soluble in\nvivo. Real proteins have evolved to be so. The cytoplasm of\nbacteria such as E . coli and V . cholerae is very complex:\nbacteria typically have a few thousand different proteins,6\nand any one of these proteins is then surrounded by thou-\nsands of different proteins, as well as RNA and DNA, small\nmolecules such as nucleotides, etc. An individual enzyme\nmust be soluble in the sense that it does not stick too strongly\nto not only other proteins of the same type but those of all\nthe other types, as well as not binding to the RNA, DNA, etc.\nIn future work, we will address this problem, but here we\nwill keep things simple and consider only interactions be-\ntween model proteins of one type. We will calculate the sec-\nond virial coefficient only for the interaction of two model\nprotein molecules of the same type. This is not realistic for\nan enzyme in a bacterial cell, as an individual enzyme will\nbe present at rather low concentrations, even though the total\nprotein concentration in bacterial cells is around 20% by\nvolume.2,7 It is, however, a good place to start, and is realis-\ntic for a few exceptional cells, such as our red blood cells\nwhich contain very high concentrations of a single protein:\nhemoglobin. Future work will address this issue and will also\nlook at proteins which bind to other proteins, as many pro-\nteins do.\nThe proteins whose sequences we gave in the first para-\ngraph are presumably orthologs: they are both descended\nfrom a common ancestral protein but have evolved indepen-\ndently, keeping their function the same, since the E . coli and\nV . cholerae lineages separated. The fact that proteins with\nthe same function, but that have evolved independently in\ndifferent species, can have very different amino-acid se-\nquences, is well known. Paralogs, proteins created by the\nduplication of a gene, also start with identical sequences but\nhave sequences that diverge with time. The differences are\nbelieved to have arisen via random mutations which are not\nrejected by natural selection because they are not actively\ndeleterious ~to the survival of the organism! but also do not\nhave any selective advantage. This theory of mutations\nchanging the amino-acid sequences of proteins without im-\nproving or reducing its ability to function is called the theory\nof neutral evolution.8\u201310 The constraints placed on this neu-\ntral evolution by the requirement on the protein to fold have\nbeen considered,11\u201316 but not those due to the requirement of\nthe protein to be soluble. The constraints placed on the se-\nquences of RNA by the requirement to be functional and the\nevolution of these sequences, are analogous to the constraints\non the sequences of, and evolution of proteins. They have\nbeen extensively studied and in many respects are rather bet-\nter understood, essentially because RNA is simpler than pro-\ntein. See the review of Higgs.17 However, there has been\nsome work which has considered protein-to-protein\nvariability,5,18 see also Ref. 19.\nWe will generate our model proteins at random ~subject\nFIG. 1.

This random walk occurs in what is often\ncalled \u2018\u2018protein space,\u2019\u2019 20 with each sequence a unique point\nin this space and two sequence neighbors if one of them can\nbe transformed into the other by a single mutation. This pro-\ntein space is vast. The set of soluble proteins exists in this\nprotein space as a set of points, one for each soluble protein.\nA schematic of the protein spaces of proteins and model\nproteins is shown in Fig. 2. It is only very schematic, the\nspace is huge and many dimensional. In each case the arrows\nrepresent a single mutation changing a protein into a neigh-\nboring protein. Below, we will generate random walks for\nour model proteins, and these will sample all soluble states\nwith equal probability. When we come to applying our re-\nsults to real, not model, proteins, we will have to assume that\nneutral evolution also samples proteins which are soluble\nwith reasonably uniform probabilities.\nIn the following section, we will perform a simple analy-\nsis of sequence data, to look at variations in the number of\nhydrophobic amino acids. The model is defined in Sec. III,\nand the stability of its solutions estimated and discussed in\nSec. IV. The last section is a conclusion.\nII. ANALYSIS OF SEQUENCE DATA\nThe sequences of the adenylate kinases of E . coli and V .\ncholerae are both of viable enzymes, they are soluble in vivo\nand catalyze a reaction. Looking at them, an obvious ques-\ntion to ask is the following: How many sequences of amino\nacids are there, that fold up to form viable adenylate kinases?\nBoth adenylate kinases have 214 amino acids. As there are\n20 types of amino acids there are 20214.10278 different\namino acid sequences of 214 amino acids. An enormous\nnumber, of which presumably the vast majority do not fold\ninto a unique native state, let alone are soluble and act as a\ncatalyst. But it seems likely that the number of possible\namino acid sequences that correspond to viable adenylate\nkinases is huge.\nA database at SWISSPROT,21,22 called PROSITE,23,24 identi-\nfied 152 amino-acid sequences as belonging to the adenylate-\nkinase family of proteins ~PROSITE accession number\nPS00113!. It did so by locating the amino acids of the active\nsite of an adenylate kinase.23,24 104 of these sequences are\nfrom prokaryotes, of which we eliminate four sequences as\nthey contain less than 100 amino acids and are presumably\nnot complete proteins. This leaves 100 adenylate kinases; 2\nof these kinases are the ones whose sequences are in the first\nparagraph. We can calculate the fraction of the amino acids\nof these adenylate kinases that are hydrophobic, h , and plot\nthis against the length of the sequence, M : the total number\nof amino acids in the sequence. The results are shown as a\nscatter plot, Fig. 3. The nine amino acids G, A, V, L, I, M, P,\nF and W, are taken to be hydrophobic, and the remaining 11\nto be hydrophilic. Here each amino acid is represented by its\none-letter code: G for glycine, A for alanine, etc. The nine\nhydrophobic amino acids are those whose side chains are\nclassified as nonpolar in Ref. 4 ~Table 4-1, p. 58!. There is\nsome arbitrariness in where the dividing line is drawn be-\ntween hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids, but differ-\nent dividing lines give rather similar spreads in h .\nFor the present work, the key observation is that the\nfraction of an adenylate kinase\u2019s amino acids which are hy-\ndrophobic varies from protein to protein, as do other proper-\nties such as their net charge.18,25 In Sec. IV we will find that\nfor our model, with a constraint imposed that model proteins\nare soluble, there is scatter in the fraction of its bits that are\nhydrophobic.\nIII. MODEL\nThe model is chosen to be as simple and as generic as\npossible, while having interactions which are mediated by\nsurface patches whose interactions are a function of se-\nquences or string of bits. The protein\u2013protein interactions\nthen depend on the values of these bits, some sets of values\ngive proteins which strongly attract each other while other\nsets give proteins which largely repel each other. This is\nperhaps the simplest model of a globular protein which al-\nlows for mutations. Within the model these mutations flip\none of the bits, a model of a mutation which converts a\nsurface residue from a hydrophobic amino acid to a hydro-\nphilic amino acid, or vice versa. A schematic of the model is\nshown in Fig. 1. An amino acid of a protein is called a\nresidue.\nFIG. 2. A schematic of protein space for both a protein and a model protein.\nThe arrows represent mutations changing a protein located at one point in\nprotein space into a neighboring protein.\nFIG. 3. A scatter plot of the fraction of its amino acids which are hydro-\nphobic, h , vs the number of amino acids M . Results for the prokaryote\nmembers of the family of adenylate kinases are shown. The PROSITE ac-\ncession number is PS00113.\n1000 J. Chem. Phys., Vol. 120, No. 2, 8 January 2004 Richard P. Sear\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jcp.aip.org\/jcp\/copyright.jsp\nThe model protein is a cube, with each of its 6 faces\nhaving a single patch.5 The lattice is cubic and each protein\noccupies eight lattice sites arranged 2 by 2 by 2; see Fig. 1.\nWe make the model 2 sites across to reduce the range of the\nattraction, which is 1 site, to half the diameter of the hard\ncore. The model proteins can rotate, and so have 24 distinct\norientations. Each of the 6 faces of the cube has a patch,\nlabeled i51 to 6, with patches 1 to 4 clockwise around a\nloop of 4 of the faces, and patches 5 and 6 on the remaining\n2 faces. The interactions between model proteins are pair-\nwise additive and consist of 2 parts. The first is simply an\nexcluded-volume interaction: 2 proteins cannot overlap. The\nsecond is that if the faces of 2 proteins are in contact there is\nan energy of interaction between the 2 touching patches of\nthe 2 proteins. By in contact we mean that the faces must\noverlap completely otherwise the energy of interaction is\ntaken to be zero. Also, the model is such that the energy of\ninteraction between two touching patches is a constant which\ndoes not change when the two proteins are rotated about the\naxis joining their centers. The touching patches are those on\nthe faces of the 2 proteins that face each other. This is all as\nin Ref. 5, the difference is in how the interaction energy of a\npair of patches i and j , ui j , is specified.\nHow a patch interacts is specified by a sequence or string\nof nB bits. If a bit has a value of 1 then the bit is hydrophilic\nor polar, whereas if it has a value of 0 then it is hydrophobic.\nThe interaction energy of a pair of touching patches, i and j ,\nis then given by\nui j52e (\na51\nnB\n~ba\n(i)21 !~b11nB2a\n( j) 21 !, ~1!\nwhere ba\n(i) is bit number a of patch i . e is the interaction\nenergy of 2 hydrophobic bits. We use energy units such that\nthe thermal energy kBT51. Thus to calculate the interaction\nthe string of bits of 1 of the patches is reversed and then the\nenergy is just the sum of the number of pairs of correspond-\ning bits where both bits are 0, are hydrophobic. The only\ninteraction is between 2 hydrophobic bits; there is no\nhydrophobic\u2013hydrophilic or hydrophilic\u2013hydrophilic inter-\naction. The reason one of the strings is reversed is that if this\nis not done then the interaction between like patches, j5i , is\njust e times the number of 0\u2019s in i\u2019s string. Reversing the\nstrings removes this problem in a simple way. Of course, the\ninteractions form a symmetric square matrix, ui j5u ji . Each\nof the 6 patches is taken to be labeled and so distinguishable,\ni.e., we take a pair of proteins where one protein can be\nobtained from the other by swapping a pair of the strings of\nbits, as 2 different proteins.\nThus, a protein is specified by giving values to the 6\nstrings of nB bits, and so there are 26nB possible different\nproteins. For all but rather small values of nB , this is a very\nlarge number of possible proteins, e.g., for nB518, we have\n331032 different model proteins. This is, however, much\nsmaller than the number of possible real proteins. Most of\nthe calculations have been done for nB518, with a few for\nnB512, for comparison. We choose nB518 as being a sen-\nsible number as then the total number of bits which describe\nthe surface is 108. Adenylate kinases, for example, have\naround 200 amino acids, of which about half are on the sur-\nface. Thus, we have about 1 bit per surface amino acid. Our\nmodel proteins can be thought of as existing in \u2018\u2018protein\nspace\u2019\u2019 with each possible protein represented by a point in\nthis space, and each protein has 6nB neighbors, each of\nwhich is obtained by flipping 1 of the bits of the protein; see\nFig. 6.\nThe second virial coefficient B2 of our lattice model is\ngiven by5\nB25\n1\n2 F272 16 (i51\n6\n(j51\n6\n\u0084exp~ui j!21\u0085G , ~2!\nFIG. 4.

The number 27 comes\nfrom the fact that each model protein excludes other proteins\nfrom a cube of 33333 lattice sites. Thus, in the high tem-\nperature limit B25B2hc527\/2. The sums over 24 orienta-\ntions reduce to sums over six orientations as rotating either\nof the two molecules around the axis joining their centers\ndoes not change the energy. The factor in front of the double\nsum is a normalization factor of 1\/36 times the six possible\nlattice sites that one molecule can occupy and be adjacent to\nthe other molecule.\nIV. STABILITY OF SOLUTIONS\nUnless e is small, many of the 26nB model proteins\nstrongly attract each other, leading to condensation, gelation,\nand possibly crystallization. By condensation we mean the\nformation of coexisting dilute and concentrated protein solu-\ntions, as have been studied extensively for the protein\nlysozyme.19,26,27 Only a fraction of the model proteins are\nviable in the sense that they are stable as single phase solu-\ntions. Clearly proteins cannot condense in vivo without se-\nverely impairing the organism\u2019s function.\nThe attractions affect the phase behavior through and\ncan be measured by the second-virial coefficient. In the ab-\nsence of attractions the second-virial coefficient is approxi-\nmately four times the volume of a particle ~assuming the\nparticle is not too anisotropic!. Attractions decrease its value\nuntil eventually the pressure does not increase monotonically\nbut decreases over a range of densities due to the negative\nvirial coefficient; a van der Waals loop forms. If we impose\nthe constraint that the second virial coefficient be above a\ncertain value, where we believe the pressure will be a mono-\ntonic function of density, we can quantify what fraction of\nour model proteins satisfy this constraint and so have solu-\ntions which are stable.\nWe insist that the reduced second virial coefficient sat-\nisfy B2 \/B2hc>21, in order for the protein to be viable. The\nfraction of proteins which are viable, according to this crite-\nrion, is denoted by f v . It is determined by generating pro-\nteins at random, setting each bit to be 0 or 1 with equal\nprobabilities, and finding the fraction with B2 \/B2hc>21.\nSee the Appendix for further details of the computations. The\nvalue of B2 \/B2hc at the critical point, the highest point on\nthe curve separating the one and two-phase regions of a\nphase transition into coexisting solutions, is typically a little\nless than 21, unless the attraction is very anisotropic. For\nthe canonical model, hard spheres plus a long-range attrac-\ntion, the critical point occurs when B2 \/B2hc521.65, and\nprovided the attraction remains isotropic this value changes\nlittle even if the attraction is made quite short ranged.27 If the\nattraction is very anisotropic then B2 \/B2hc can ~depending a\nlittle on the precise nature of the anisotropy! be much more\nnegative at the critical point,28\u201330 but for simplicity we insist\non B2 \/B2hc being above a fixed value for all our proteins,\nregardless of how anisotropic are their attractions. Crystalli-\nzation out of not-too-concentrated solutions also requires as\na minimum, attractions of about the strength required to\nmake B2 \/B2hc around 21. The propensity to crystallize de-\npends on the details of the attraction, for work on the earlier\nversion of this model with random values of the patch\u2013patch\nattractions; see Ref. 5.\nResults are shown, as a function of e, for nB512 and 18,\nin Fig. 4. As might have been expected, as e increases, the\nfraction of viable proteins decreases exponentially, but note\nthat even for nB512 and e52, there are still 7.13109 viable\nproteins, a very large number. Partly, what is happening is\nthat as e increases then fewer and fewer hydrophobic bits are\nallowed, and as the fraction of bits that are hydrophobic de-\ncreases, then the number of possible proteins decreases: there\nare many possible proteins with close to half their bits 0s\nand half 1s , but only one with all its bits equal to 1. Partly,\nwhat happens is that correlations are introduced between the\nhydrophobic bits in the strings. The hydrophobic bits tend to\navoid each other, e.g., if all six strings have all their bits from\n1 to nB\/2 ~assuming nB is even! hydrophilic, then any or all\nof their bits from nB\/211 to nB may be hydrophobic without\nthere being any attractions. Thus here the hydrophobic bits\navoid each other, in order to avoid the attractive interactions\nwhich make the second virial coefficient negative and thus\nviolate our solubility condition.\nWe can measure both these effects by defining two quan-\ntities. The first is the mean fraction of bits which are 0, are\nhydrophobic. Denoting this by ^h&, it is defined by\n^h&5\n1\n6nB K (i51\n6\n(\na51\nnB\n~12ba\n(i)!L . ~3!\nThe average denoted by ^ & is over proteins which satisfy our\ncriterion for the stability of the solution. We use h to denote\nboth the fraction of bits in our model proteins that are hy-\ndrophobic, and the fraction of residues in real proteins that\nare hydrophobic. A measure of the correlation between the\nprobability that a bit a is hydrophobic, and that the bit 1\n1nB2a with which it interacts is also hydrophobic is de-\nnoted by ^hhp&, and is defined by\nFIG. 7.

The model has\nnB518 bits and the quantities are plotted as a function of e.\nAs e increases, the fraction of bits which can be hydrophobic\nwithout the second virial coefficient becoming too negative\ndecreases. Also, the anticorrelations between a bit being hy-\ndrophobic and the bit with which it interacts being also hy-\ndrophobic increases. If there were no correlation between the\nstates of the 2 bits then ^hhp&51, which is true for e50, but\nthis function decreases as e increases. If a bit is hydrophobic\nthe bit with which it interacts is less likely to be hydropho-\nbic. We have shown results just for nB518 but results for\nother numbers of bits are similar.\nWe only constrain the second virial coefficient to be\nabove a certain value; we do not constrain its precise value.\nAs the second virial coefficient is a function of the number of\nhydrophobic bits on its six faces and as this number is an\ninteger between 0 and nB , the second virial coefficient can\nonly take one of a set of values, and so the probability den-\nsity function for B2 \/B2hc is a set of delta functions. We have\nplotted these as spikes, with the height of each spike set to\nthe probability that B2 \/B2hc has this value. We can see that\nthe most likely values of the reduced second virial coefficient\nare near the minimum allowed value of 21. This is simply\nbecause there are many more sets of strings with close to half\nthe bits hydrophobic than there are with most of the bits\nhydrophilic, and the proteins with close to half the bits hy-\ndrophobic have very large and negative second virial coeffi-\ncients. There is only one protein with all 108 bits hydrophilic\nbut the number of proteins which have nine hydrophobic and\nnine hydrophilic bits on each face is (18!\/9!2)6;1028. The\nprobability distribution function for all possible proteins ~in-\ncluding those with B2 \/B2hc,21) is sharply peaked at a\nvalue much less than 1, for nB518 and e52, and Fig. 6\nshows just the high B2 tail of this distribution.\nThe probability distribution function, again a sum of\ndelta functions, of h the fraction of hydrophobic bits, is plot-\nted in Fig. 7. As with Fig. 6, nB518 and e52. The distribu-\ntion is peaked at h a little above 0.25: the mean value ^h&\n50.27 and the standard deviation is 0.029. As h increases\ntowards 0.5 then there are many more possible proteins but a\nrapidly increasing fraction of these are not soluble as a single\nphase according to our criterion. Thus there is a trade-off\nbetween the number of possible proteins and the fraction that\nare soluble. This trade-off results in most proteins having\nbetween 20% and 35% of their bits hydrophobic. This of\ncourse depends on nB and e. Increasing either one decreases\n^h& but the picture remains qualitatively the same.\nLet us return to our results for adenylate kinases; Fig. 3.\nAlthough it should be borne in mind that many of adenylate\nkinases\u2019 hydrophobic amino acids will be in the center of the\nprotein, not at its surface, we can still quantify the scatter in\nh for the kinases, and compare it to the scatter in h for the\nmodel proteins. But of course any comparison will be purely\nqualitative. The adenylate kinases have around 200 amino\nacids in total, of which about 100 are classified as hydropho-\nbic. We can try to model the distribution functions for h , for\nboth adenylate kinases and our model proteins, with\nh5n21(\ni51\nn\nz i , ~5!\nwhere for an adenylate kinase the sum is over all its amino\nacids in a protein, n5M , and for a model protein the sum is\nover the n56nB bits. The z i are independent random vari-\nables which are 1 with probability ^h& and zero otherwise.\nFor adenylate kinases, see Fig. 3, we find that the standard\ndeviation of h is 0.040, and Eq. ~5! gives a standard devia-\ntion of 0.035, only a little lower. To obtain the value of 0.040\nwe took the sum over 206 terms; 206 is the mean length of\nthe adenylate kinases in Fig. 3. Taking all the proteins to be\nthe same length will decrease the spread slightly. Note that\nwe can predict the distribution of the proteins\u2019 hydrophobic-\nity reasonably accurately using only the central limit theo-\nrem.\nFor our model proteins the standard deviation of h is\n0.029, while Eq. ~5! predicts 0.043, which is rather larger but\nstill comparable. Also, of course the shape of the distribution\nin Fig. 7 is quite close to Gaussian. Thus, the results for our\nmodel proteins are similar to those for real proteins, but as\nboth are within a factor of 1.5 of a simple prediction based\non assuming the hydrophobic amino acids\/bits are randomly\ndistributed, it is hard to draw definite conclusions from this.\nThe distribution of net charges can also be modeled assum-\ning that the charged amino acids are distributed at\nrandom.18,25\nV. CONCLUSION\nWe started with the idea that globular proteins needed to\nbe soluble to function, and that their interactions depended\non their surfaces which in turn were sensitive to which types\nof amino acids were at the surfaces of proteins. Then we\ndefined a very simple model of a protein, whose surface-\nmediated-interactions depended on the values of strings of\nbits. A mutation in a protein such as an adenylate kinase\nwhich substituted a hydrophobic amino acid at the surface\nfor a hydrophilic one could then be modeled by flipping one\nof these bits. Within our model, and with the constraint that\na solution of the model protein is stable; the second virial\ncoefficient is rather variable, its probability distribution func-\ntion is plotted in Fig. 6. The criterion for the solution to be\nstable as a single phase is taken to be that the reduced second\nvirial coefficient B2 \/B2hc>21, which is enough for almost\nall fluids to be above their critical point. The condition that\nthe protein solution be stable as a single phase is clearly a\nnecessary condition, although in fact the second virial coef-\nficient may be be more tightly constrained than this. Al-\nthough the model used is simple, this variability does give\ncredence to the idea that the variation in the fraction of hy-\ndrophobic amino acids in enzymes like adenylate kinase, see\nFig. 3, gives rise to variability in the protein\u2013protein inter-\nactions of these enzymes. In other words, that the second\nvirial coefficients of E . coli\u2019s and V . cholerae\u2019s adenylate\n1003J. Chem.

Unfortunately, virial coefficient measurements\nhave not been performed for families of proteins. The vari-\nability is relevant to problems such as the purification and\ncrystallization of proteins. The separation of one protein\nfrom all the others in an extract from a cell which might\ncontain thousands of proteins relies on differences in physi-\ncal properties, charge, surface stickiness, etc., between pro-\nteins.\nThe probability distribution function of the second-virial\ncoefficient, Fig. 6, is just the high B2 tail of the distribution\nof all proteins. The remainder of the distribution function is\ncut off by the requirement that B2 \/B2hc>21. This full dis-\ntribution function has a peak at an e dependent value of B2 ;\nhere well below 21. Thus, without the cutoff at B2 \/B2hc\n521, the distribution function is similar to the Gaussian\ndistribution function found for the earlier model in which the\npatch\u2013patch interactions were taken to be random variables.5\nIf we had kept with the previous model of describing with\nrandom variables the patch\u2013patch interactions, and required\nthat B2 \/B2hc>21, then we would have obtained a distribu-\ntion of second-virial coefficients similar to that in Fig. 7. In\nthat sense a distribution like that in Fig. 7 is generic to any\nsystem where all model proteins except for those in a large\nB2 tail are cut off. However, within the earlier, simpler,\nmodel there is no clear way to look at either mutations and\nhence evolution, or to compare with sequence data for real\nproteins, as we did when we compared Figs. 3 and 7.\nFinally, many simplifying assumptions have been made\nin order to arrive at our model system. It is therefore appro-\npriate to comment on how this work can be extended to\ninclude more of the features of proteins inside cells. Both the\nmodel and our simple criterion for viability can be improved.\nThe model is rather crude, and our sharp division between\nproteins deemed soluble and those deemed insoluble, could\nbe softened. Then the fitness of a protein would decline over\nsome range of values of the second virial coefficient. Also,\nwe did not impose a maximum on the second virial coeffi-\ncient. If it is important to limit the osmotic pressure, values\nof the second virial coefficient which are too positive may\nalso be undesirable. However, in terms of understanding the\nbehavior of proteins in the complex crowded mixture of pro-\nteins that is the in vivo environment, perhaps the most im-\nportant extensions of this work, is to multicomponent mix-\ntures, and to include proteins which bind to each other.\nInside cells thousands of different proteins are mixed to-\ngether at a total protein concentration of around 20%, and\nmany proteins are not monomeric but are part of complexes.\nThe model studied here is flexible enough to both generate\nthousands of different proteins and to permit selective bind-\ning between proteins. Work on both is ongoing.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge that this work started\nwith inspiring discussions with D. Frenkel. This work was\nsupported by the Wellcome Trust ~069242!.\nAPPENDIX: COMPUTATIONS\nWe are principally interested in the fraction of proteins\nthat are soluble according to our criterion, and the distribu-\ntion functions and means of various properties of soluble\nproteins. The fraction of proteins with B2 \/B2hc>21 is de-\ntermined by simply generating a very large number of pro-\nteins at random and finding the fraction that satisfy this re-\nquirement. The length of all runs are determined either by\nthe requirement to obtain at least two significant figures or\nuntil longer runs produce almost identical plots. An excep-\ntion is for nB518 and e52 where due to the smallness of\nf v , it was only possible to obtain 1 significant figure of\naccuracy. The distribution functions, means, etc., are ob-\ntained by starting with a soluble protein and generating a\nrandom walk in the space of soluble proteins. This is essen-\ntially no different from Metropolis Monte Carlo as applied to\na system with a hard potential, e.g., a fluid of hard spheres,\nas our constraint B2 \/B2hc>21, is a hard constraint. The\naverages are then obtained over these random walks.\nThe algorithm samples \u2018\u2018protein space,\u2019\u2019 20 with each se-\nquence a unique point in this space and two sequences neigh-\nbors if one of them can be transformed into the other by a\nsingle mutation. This protein space is vast for real proteins\nand still very large for our model; for our model it contains\n26nB points. Note that all viable proteins are connected to all\nother viable proteins by an unbroken path of viable proteins\nand links between neighboring viable proteins. This is easy\nto see if we consider that B2 always either increases or stays\nthe same if we flip a hydrophobic bit. Thus, starting from any\nviable protein we can flip each of its hydrophobic bits to\nhydrophilic bits, one at a time, until we reach the protein\nwith all 6nB bits hydrophilic. Each intermediate in this path\nmust satisfy our solubility criterion as it is obtained from a\nprotein which satisfies this criterion by flipping one or more\nhydrophobic bits. Thus we have proved that all viable pro-\nteins are connected to the protein with all hydrophilic bits,\nand so trivially all viable proteins are part of a connected\nnetwork. This immediately implies that we can go from any\none viable protein to any other via our Monte Carlo moves.\n1 The two proteins have SWISSPROT ~Refs. 21 and 22! accession numbers\nQ9KTB7 and O66490.
