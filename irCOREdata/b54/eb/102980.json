There are many models\nthat attempt to account for the electron field emission process observed in these films. The initial\nmodels that were based on the emission due purely to a negative electron affinity have now been\nmodified. The emission from diamond like carbon ~DLC! films, although following a Fowler\u2013\nNordheim type curve, do not give realistic values for the emission areas or barriers purely based on\na tunneling mechanism. Therefore, a model based on space charge band bending at the back junction\nis proposed to account for the electron emission at low electric fields from DLC. In this \u2018\u2018space\ncharge interlayer\u2019\u2019 model the real cathode is the substrate, from which hot electrons are created due\nto the fully depleted DLC film the electrons encounter before reaching the front surface of the film.\nIn this article we extend the model to incorporate the emission of electrons from polycrystalline\ndiamond thin films. \u00a9 1999 American Vacuum Society. @S0734-211X~99!10802-3#I. INTRODUCTION\nResearch into the next generation of display technologies\nthat are flat and cheap to manufacture has produced a number\nof contenders. The liquid crystal display ~LCD! is the clear\nmarket leader at present, with flat panel displays ~FPD!\nbased on field emission processes being envisaged as a major\ncontender for future high definition display applications such\nas televisions.1 In order for these field emission based flat\npanel displays to operate commercially, stable long lasting\ncathodes that do not degrade with time are needed over large\nareas. Chemical vapor deposition based systems are well\nsuited to produce large area thin films at relatively low cost.\nCurrent FPDs based on field emission utilize metal tips ~such\nas Mo! in order to create field enhancement at their tips to\nextract electrons. The lifetime of the cathodes and the rela-\ntive expense incurred in the integrated electronic driver cir-\ncuitry used for FPDs can be vastly improved if the voltages,\nand thus the electric fields, that need to be switched to ex-\ntract electrons from the cathode were to be lowered. To\nlower the electric field required to extract electrons from the\ncathode, the emission process needs to be understood and\nsuitable materials once identified, modeled. Diamond thin\nfilms have been proposed as a viable cold cathode alternative\nfor field emission applications due to the apparently low ~or\nnegative! electron affinity making it feasible for use as flat\ncathodes that operate at low electric fields.

We present a model\nin this article for electron emission due to space charge in-\nduced band bending creating hot electrons which gain energy\nto exit its host material ~\u2018\u2018interlayer\u2019\u2019! by virtue of its fully\ndepleted bands.9\u201311 If this model is correct, it is expected that\nnot only DLC or amorphous carbon ~a-C! but other materials\nwith low electron affinities ~in the range 2\u20133 eV! would also\nbe suitable to act as space charge interlayers for the release\nof electrons from highly doped substrates into vacuum.12\u201314\nII. FIELD ELECTRON EMISSION MODELS FOUND\nIN THE LITERATURE\nIn the case of field electron emission from thin films,\nthere are three aspects that need to be examined when mod-\neling electron emission, namely, the electron source, the\ninjection\/transport of electrons within the source, and the re-\nlease mechanism of electrons into vacuum. In the case of\nmodels based on negative electron affinity ~NEA! cathodes,\nan electron source is required to \u2018\u2018pump\u2019\u2019 electrons into the\nconduction band of the NEA material, from which there is557\/17\u00842\u0085\/557\/5\/$15.00 \u00a91999 American Vacuum Society\n558 Silva, Amaratunga, and Okano: Modeling of the electron field emission process 558only a small barrier, due to surface effects such as dipoles,\nthat needs to be overcome for electron emission to take\nplace.\nBayliss and Latham15 proposed a hot electron emission\nmodel based on band bending from wide band gap insulating\nmaterial. A phenomenological model for field emission from\nnitrogen containing hydrogenated amorphous carbon ~a-\nC:H:N! using a semiconductor model with space charge\nband bending induced hot electrons has also been proposed.9\nAdditional results have shown that the \u2018\u2018interlayer\u2019\u2019 model\nmay be extended to explain electron emission from other\namorphous materials such as tetrahedral a-C ~ta-C!,12 amor-\nphous silicon carbide ~a-SiC!,13 and amorphous silicon\n~a-Si!.14\nThe question that should be paramount in considering\nemission from diamond and polycrystalline diamond films is\nwhere the source of the electrons that are emitted to the\nsurface originates. We know that diamond is a large band\ngap semiconductor with an optical gap of 5.5 eV. It is also\nwell known that it is difficult to electronically dope polycrys-\ntalline diamond films n type. Therefore, even though dia-\nmond has a negative electron affinity ~or low positive elec-\ntron affinity! on certain crystal planes, it has a very low\nintrinsic concentration of electrons in the conduction band,\nas with most wide gap semiconductors\/insulators that cannot\nbe electronically doped n type. On the other hand, field emis-\nsion results on all polycrystalline diamond samples clearly\nshow field emission at relatively low electric fields. The re-\nsults of Zhu et al.2 show the more defective the polycrystal-\nline diamond @observed by the full-width at half-maximum\n~FWHM! of the Raman signal# to lower the electric field\nrequired for electron field emission. Similar results have also\nbeen observed by others.3 Zhu et al.2 have explained this\nbehavior using a model in which additional defect subbands\nare created within the 5.5 eV band gap of diamond. Other\nmodels introduced include the electron emission in diamond\nvia graphite inclusions which act as conducting regions\nwhich help induce higher electric fields in the interior of the\ndiamond and models which discuss the possibility of en-\nhanced conductivity along grain boundaries.16 An alternative\nmodel in which emission occurs via surface states located\n;1 eV below the conduction band of diamond was\nproposed17 based on theoretical calculations.\nThe problem of how a continuous source of electrons may\nbe supplied from a back contact into the conduction band of\nthe diamond at a relatively low electric field has been a com-\nplex issue not answered satisfactorily as of yet. It is very\nunlikely that electrons will be thermally excited directly into\nthe conduction band of diamond to supply the measured\nemission current from states situated 4 eV below it at the\nreported low threshold fields. Values below 5 V\/mm have\nbeen observed by a number of groups. Assuming there is\nfield penetration into the diamond films, which may be un-\nlikely due to the large thickness ~tens of microns! of some\nfilms, then due to the dielectric constant of 5.5 of diamond,\nGauss\u2019 law gives an electric field of less than 1 V\/mm in the\nsemi-insulating films which is insufficient to induce enoughJ. Vac. Sci. Technol. B, Vol. 17, No. 2, Mar\/Apr 1999band bending to surmount most barriers ~especially the large\nbarrier at the back contact!. Therefore, although having a\nnegative electron affinity or low positive affinity is of impor-\ntance in the final stage of electron emission into vacuum, a\nsource of electrons that maintain the conditions for current\ncontinuity must also be present.\nGeis et al.18,19 noted the importance of the back metal\ncontact in their type Ib n-type diamond. They found that\nonce a threshold voltage of several kV was applied across\ntheir substrates, an electric field of only ;0.2 V mm21 was\nrequired for emission to take place. The applied voltage for\nemission was approximately independent of anode-cathode\nspacing. But, in the case of the boron doped p-type diamond\nan electric field of 24 V mm21 was required for emission to\ntake place. They18,19 also showed that by varying the surface\nroughness of their back contact it was possible to vary the\nelectric field required for field emission to take place. This\nwas attributed to the rougher back contact, which made it\nmore likely for electrons to enter the conduction band of the\ndiamond films by tunneling due to the high local fields. It is\nof course possible that with the roughening of the back sur-\nface, a more pronounced DLC interface layer will come into\nexistence and thereby help improve the emission properties\nnot only by increasing the b value but also due to space\ncharge band bending as discussed in this model. These ex-\nperiments emphasize the importance of the back contact, and\nindicate that the rate limiting process for electron emission\nmay also be associated with it.\nIII. SPACE CHARGE INTERLAYER MODEL FOR\nPOLYCRYSTALLINE DIAMOND\nIn the model by Amaratunga and Silva,9 a fully depleted,\ndoped interlayer is shown to sustain a larger electric field\nthan the applied macroscopic field due to space charge ef-\nfects as a consequence of having to satisfy the Poisson rela-\ntionship in the interlayer. The highly doped n11-Si and\na-C:H:N film acts as a heterojunction and using the electron\naffinity value calculated by Robertson20 of ;2.5 eV for the\nDLC ~a-C! film a large band discontinuity is predicted at this\njunction.\nIt has been shown by high resolution scanning tunneling\nelectron microscopy coupled with electron energy loss spec-\ntroscopy that polycrystalline diamond grains are surrounded\nby a thin layer of amorphous carbon.21 This result has been\nconfirmed by micro-Raman analysis across grain\nboundaries22 and very recent electron energy-loss spectra\n~EELS! analysis that has examined the joint density of states\n~JDOS! of polycrystalline diamond.23 A schematic of the\npolycrystalline diamond based on these results is shown in\nFig. 1. In the context of electron field emission from poly-\ncrystalline diamond this is of crucial importance in that by\nhaving such a layer of DLC ~or a-C! at the back contact it is\nprobable that space charge based band bending can arise.\nThis means that when the DLC is fully depleted, electrons at\nrelatively low electric fields can become \u2018\u2018hot\u2019\u2019 by drifting\ndown the DLC and enter the conduction band of the dia-\nmond. Once in the diamond conduction band they can be\n559 Silva, Amaratunga, and Okano: Modeling of the electron field emission process 559readily emitted at low fields due to the low electron affinity\nof the diamond surface. In the phenomenological model pro-\nposed, for the most basic case a structure composed of a\nmetal or highly doped Si substrate will be followed by the\nDLC layer ~grain boundary! with a crystalline diamond front\nsurface, as shown by the band diagrams in Figs. 2 and 3.\nTherefore, there are two barriers observed by electrons prior\nto emission for this simple case, one between the metal ~or\nSi! and the DLC ~a-C!, and the other between the DLC ~a-C!\nand the polycrystalline diamond. Due to the amorphous na-\nFIG. 1. Cross-sectional and plan view schematics of the polycrystalline dia-\nmond thin films.

In this calculation, an electron affinity and mobility gap\nof 2.5 and 2.0 eV have been assumed for the DLC in the\ngrain boundaries.9 The DLC ~a-C! films too have been taken\nto be doped due to the dopants present in the polycrystalline\ndiamond films being intermixed in the thin amorphous films\n~Figs. 2 and 3!.

These may subsequently gain energy from\nFIG. 3. Proposed electronic band diagram for field emission from p-type\npolycrystalline diamond films. ~a!

The diamond is assumed to have\nan electron affinity of ;0.5 eV, with the metal giving a\ntypical known Schottky barrier height fsb close to 4 eV for\nthe diamond being used as the back contact.20 In Fig. 2, the\nn-type diamond which is assumed to be doped with N, has an\nactivation energy of 1.7 eV with respect to the conduction\nband and the p-type diamond in Fig. 3 is assumed to have an\nactivation energy of 0.3 eV with respect to its valence band.\nThe figures are to illustrate quantitatively on how a thin layer\nof DLC ~a-C! at a grain boundary in polycrystalline diamond\nwill help in the emission of electrons at relatively low thresh-\nold fields. A more detailed analysis of the band bending ob-\nserved, without consideration of the DLC interfacial layer,\ncan be found in the work of Lerner et al.25 who clearly show\nthe band bending due to space charge for the n-Si\/n-doped\ndiamond film when the current continuity equation is solved\nrigorously for the whole system. It is quite encouraging that\nthis phenomenological model using the space charge analysis\ngives rise to band diagrams similar to those obtained by\nLerner.25\nIt is interesting to note that the band diagrams constructed\naccording to our model, an n-doped polycrystalline diamond\nfilm would need a significantly lower threshold field for\nemission in comparison to a p-doped film. This is observed\nin the results of Geis et al.19 and the results obtained in this\nstudy shown in Fig. 4.

B, Vol. 17, No. 2, Mar\/Apr 1999opposed to the abrupt 4 eV metal ~or Si!-diamond back con-\ntact without a DLC transition layer.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe above analysis may be used to explain the results\nobserved by Zhu et al.2 and Wistsora et al.3 where the higher\nthe amorphous component in their polycrystalline diamond\nfilms, the lower the threshold electric field that was required\nto emit electrons. On the basis of our model we would see\nthis as being due to an increase in the DLC containing grain\nboundaries across which the electrons could travel and gain\nenergy. A small energy gain of the electrons by heating due\nto drift in an electric field in the DLC film is sufficient to\novercome the surface barriers shown in the figures. The DLC\nin the diamond grain boundaries effectively acts as a step-\nping stone for the emission of electrons by providing a two\n~or multi! stage process for the gaining of energy.24 Although\nit is possible for the electrons to be directly emitted to the\nvacuum from the DLC ~grain boundaries! if it were to gain\nsufficient energy, it would have to overcome a significantly\nlarger surface barrier in comparison to if it were to use the\ntwo or multistage process. Therefore, it is more probable that\nthe emission will be via the diamond surface rather than the\ngrain boundaries.\nThe observations of Geis et al.18 may also be explained\nusing the above model. In the case of the type Ib nitrogen\ndoped diamond; once the electrons have enough energy to\novercome the two barriers, little or no further field is re-\nquired due to the band bending in the n-diamond films which\nwill readily emit electrons. Therefore, the apparent indepen-\ndence of the threshold voltage to anode-cathode spacing in\nthe results is reported. In the case of the p-diamond films,\neven though electrons may be excited to the conduction band\nof diamond at the DLC p-diamond interface, due to the na-\nture of the initial band bending a higher applied voltage will\nbe required as the flat band condition has to be reached be-\nfore carriers can tunnel into the diamond from the DLC and\nbe transported to the surface for emission18 @Fig. 3~b!#. The\nvoltage which has to be maintained between the emitting\nsurface of diamond and the back contact is significantly\nhigher in this case, and will be seen as a larger rise in the\nanode-cathode field required for electron emission.\nA number of models have been introduced that discuss\nthe space charge effects in the interlayer material and\njunctions.6,18,19,25\u201327 Hot electrons caused by space charge\ninduced band bending have also been proposed as a possible\nmechanism by which electrons are emitted from polycrystal-\nline diamond deposited on metal tips.6 But, yet in all these\ncases,6,18,19,25\u201327 the space charge region has been confined to\nwithin the crystalline diamond. In the work by Geis et al.18,19\nand Lerner et al.25,26 a small layer of the diamond back sur-\nface is assumed to be ionized due to asperities at the back\ncontact. Reference 6 discusses emission from metal tips,\nwhich have a diamond crystal on its apex, which discusses a\nsimilar process to the Geis and Lerner emission processes.\nWe in our model for the first time have introduced the con-\ncept of fully depleted grain boundaries giving rise to the\n561 Silva, Amaratunga, and Okano: Modeling of the electron field emission process 561observed field emission results in doped and undoped poly-\ncrystalline DLC films. The grain boundaries being thin\nenough to not only be fully depleted when a suitably large\nelectric field is applied to the cathodes, but also be able to\nsustain a sufficient voltage drop to give rise to the \u2018\u2018heating\u2019\u2019\nof electrons within a short spatial distance.\nIt is interesting to note that recent field electron energy\ndistribution ~FEED! experiments by Schlesser et al.28 indi-\ncate the presence of space charge in the diamond films, and\naccording to their results an applied macroscopic field of 2\nV\/mm created an electric field greater than 10 V\/mm within\nthe diamond film. In the proposed space charge interlayer\nmodel such a result is expected. The data shown in Fig. 4 for\ndoped diamond films further strengthens the arguments for\nan interlayer model by showing that n-type materials, namely\nnitrogen and phosphorus doped films give significantly better\nresults than the boron doped p-diamond films. It should be\nnoted that although phosphorous is a shallow donor in com-\nparison to nitrogen in the polycrystalline diamond films, the\nnitrogen level may be more advantageously situated for band\nbending and depletion of the DLC layers. It is well known\nthat with increased impurity addition in diamond, more sp2\nstates are created which could also help in the creation of\nmore uniform regions of grain boundaries that can help with\nthe electron emission process.\nIn conclusion, a space charge induced hot electron model\nis proposed to explain the observed electron emission char-\nacteristics of diamond and diamond-like carbon thin films.\nThe phenomenological model proposed in this article may be\nextended to other amorphous and polycrystalline semicon-\nducting materials.\n1K.
