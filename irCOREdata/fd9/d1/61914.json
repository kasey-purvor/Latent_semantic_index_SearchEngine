Although ozone 6 \ndeposition to many vegetation types has been measured in the field, no data have been 7 \nreported for potatoes. Such measurements, including the latent heat flux, were made 8 \nover a fully-grown potato field in central Scotland during the summer of 2006, covering a 9 \n4-week period just after rainfall and then dry, sunny weather. The magnitude of the flux 10 \nwas typical of many canopies showing the expected diurnal cycles. Although the bulk-11 \ncanopy stomatal conductance declined as the field dried out (~300 mmol-O3 m-2 s-1 to 12 \n~70 mmol-O3 m-2 s-1), the total ozone flux did not follow the same trend, indicating that 13 \nnon-stomatal deposition was significant. Over a dry surface non-stomatal resistance (Rns) 14 \nwas 270-450 s m-1, while over a wet surface Rns was ~50% smaller and both decreased 15 \nwith increasing surface temperature and friction velocity. From the variation with relative 16 \nhumidity (RH) it is suggested that three processes occur on leaf surfaces: on a very dry 17 \nsurface ozone is removed by thermal decomposition, possibly enhanced by photolytic 18 \nreactions in the daytime and so Rns decreases as temperature increases; at 50-70% RH a 19 \nthin film of liquid blocks the \u201cdry\u201d process and resistance increases; above 60-70% RH 20 \nsufficient surface water is present for aqueous reactions to remove ozone and resistance 21 \ndecreases. 22 \nKeywords: eddy-correlation; surface conductance; ozone critical levels; AOT40, AFst6; 23 \nstomatal uptake; non-stomatal; dry deposition 24 \nCapsule: Ozone deposition to a potato crop depends not only on stomatal uptake but is 25 \nenhanced by increasing surface temperature or the presence of water. 26 \nIntroduction 27 \nTropospheric ozone (O3) is a secondary pollutant, produced via photochemical reactions 28 \nof nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and non-methane volatile organic 29 \ncompounds (VOCs). Although it is a natural constituent of the troposphere, man-made 30 \nemissions of NOx and VOCs have led to an increase in concentrations (Horowitz, 2006). 31 \nAverage concentrations across much of North America, Europe and Asia are now large 32 \nenough to cause widespread damage to many types of vegetation, including commercial 33 \ncrops (Ashmore, 2005; Ashmore and Marshall, 1999) and in some regions, peaks of 34 \nconcentration occur that can affect human health (Bell, et al., 2007; Klumpp, et al., 35 \n2006). Ozone causes damage to vegetation and humans (as well as other animals) when 36 \nit is breathed in, through the stomata in the case of plants, and causes a chain of 37 \ndamaging oxidative reactions in internal cells (Larcher, 2001; PORG, 1998). 38 \n 2\nMany studies of ozone fluxes in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) have been 1 \nundertaken (e.g. Colbeck and Harrison, 1985; Enders, 1992; Hargreaves, et al., 1992; 2 \nStocker, et al., 1987), showing that ozone is always deposited to the Earth\u2019 surface, 3 \nbeing taken up by plants via stomata as well as being deposited to leaf cuticles and other 4 \nexternal surfaces. It has often been assumed that stomatal uptake is the main sink and 5 \ncontrolling factor in ozone deposition. However, it has been shown that non-stomatal 6 \ndeposition (to leaf cuticles and soil) can also be significant and varies with surface 7 \nconditions such as wetness and temperature (Altimir, et al., 2004; Fowler, et al., 2001; 8 \nFuentes, 1992; Fuentes, et al., 1992). In addition, over forests, destruction by reaction 9 \nwith biogenic VOCs can provide an additional chemical sink below the flux measurement 10 \nheight (Kurpius and Goldstein, 2003). 11 \nConcentration based indices (e.g. Fowler, et al., 1995; Fuhrer, et al., 1997; Legge, et al., 12 \n1995) are commonly used to assess the impact of ozone on vegetation, but it is generally 13 \naccepted that adverse effects are governed by the stomatal flux. The United Nations 14 \nEconomic Commission for Europe (UNECE) recently proposed new critical levels for ozone 15 \neffects on wheat and potato based on accumulated stomatal uptake (ICP, 2004). These 16 \nlevels were defined using stomatal conductance and ozone exposure data from 17 \nexperiments in controlled environments as there are no measurements of ozone 18 \ndeposition to potatoes in the field. To better understand and model ozone deposition to 19 \nthis crop, field measurements were undertaken during the summer of 2006 in central 20 \nScotland. The micrometeorolgical technique of eddy correlation was used to measure the 21 \ntotal flux of ozone and water-vapour over a field of potatoes. The water-vapour flux is 22 \nused to estimate bulk-canopy stomatal conductance which is required to separate the 23 \ntotal ozone flux into its stomatal and non-stomatal components. The results are reported 24 \nhere and used to show the importance of non-stomatal deposition in controlling the total 25 \nflux even when a fully-developed crop is present. 26 \nMethods 27 \nFieldsite 28 \nThe potato field was located at Gilchriston Farm (GT; 55.9oN, 2.8oW, 155 m asl), 24 km 29 \nsouth-east of Edinburgh in Central Scotland (Figure 1a). The field was planted with 28.1 30 \nha of Estima potatoes surrounded by a border of Lolium perenne (1.4 ha, Figure 1b); it is 31 \nfairly flat but slopes gently down to the south-west. One half of the field was planted with 32 \npotatoes for seed (13.5 ha) and the other for food (14.6 ha). At the start of 33 \nmeasurements on the 9th of July the plants were fully grown at 45 cm tall and flowered 34 \ntwo weeks later, in mid-July. On the 3rd of August the crop was de-haulmed; the 35 \nvegetation is sprayed with a weak acid solution and consequently dies off. The 36 \n 3\nmeasurements therefore occurred during the period of tuber initiation and development 1 \nthrough to harvest. 2 \nThe instrumentation mast was placed towards the northern edge of the field, about 10 m 3 \nto the west of the SE to NE centre line (Figure 1b). The fetch (Kormann and Meixner, 4 \n2001) varied between ca. 250 to 400 m with ~400 m in the prevailing south-westerly 5 \nwind direction. The topography and planting of the field allowed for measurements in all 6 \nwind directions. 7 \nMicrometeorological theory 8 \nVertical transport between the atmosphere and the surface primarily occurs via turbulent 9 \neddies, which are variable in size but are generally smaller towards the surface (Garratt, 10 \n1992). The eddies cause high frequency variations in wind speed, air temperature and 11 \ntrace-gas concentration and the eddy-covariance (EC) method is used to analyse these 12 \nvariations and estimate the vertical fluxes of momentum, sensible heat and the trace-13 \ngas. The signals can be equated to a mean over time plus the instantaneous departure 14 \nfrom the mean, commonly written, following Reynolds averaging as: 15 \n X = x + x\u2019 (1.) 16 \nwhere x = mean with time, x\u2019 = instantaneous deviation from the mean value. 17 \nThe friction velocity (u*) which is a measure of momentum transfer to the surface, 18 \nreflecting the effects of surface roughness and wind velocity, is calculated using: 19 \n u* = (- 'w'u )\n0.5, (2.) 20 \nwhere u and w are the streamwise horizontal and vertical component of wind speed, 21 \nrespectively.  22 \nIn all conditions the average vertical flux of momentum (\u03c4), or shear stress, is defined 23 \nas: 24 \n \u03c4 = -\u03c1 ''wu  = \u03c1 2*u  (3.) 25 \nBy analogy with this equation the fluxes of sensible heat (H), latent heat (\u03bbE) and a trace 26 \ngas (Fs) can be written as: 27 \n H = \u03c1cp w\u2019T\u2019  (4.) 28 \n \u03bbE = \u03bb w\u2019q\u2019 (5.) 29 \n Fs = w\u2019\u03c7s\u2019 (6.) 30 \nwhere \u03c1 = air density (kg m-3), cp = specific heat at constant pressure for moist air 31 \n(1.01 J kg-1 K-1), T = air temperature (K), \u03bb= latent heat of vaporisation of water (J 32 \nkg-1 K-1, calculated as \u03bb = -2.38 T+3148.83), E = water-vapour flux (kg m-2 s-1), q = 33 \nspecific humidity of air (mass of water vapour per unit mass of moist air), \u03c7s = 34 \nconcentration of trace gas S. 35 \n 4\nHence measurements of the turbulent fluctuations of each component can be used to 1 \ndetermine fluxes. This method has the advantage of being quite simple and direct but the 2 \nturbulent fluctuations occur very rapidly so fast response instruments are required. 3 \nThe standard resistance analogy (Chamberlain, 1966; Monteith and Unsworth, 1990) 4 \nwhere the flux of an entity is equated to a flow of current through a series of resistors, as 5 \nillustrated in Figure 2, can be used to investigate the influence of surface processes on 6 \nthe atmospheric fluxes. The canopy resistance to ozone deposition, Rc, is found using: 7 \n Rc =Rt \u2013 (Ra+Rb_O3) = ]RR[\n]dz[F\n]dz[\nO_ba\nO\nO\n3\n3\n3 +\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u03c7\n,  (7.) 8 \nwhere Rt = total resistance to deposition, z = reference height (2.15 m), d = zero 9 \nplane displacement height; the height at which canopy effectively becomes closed and 10 \nall momentum is dissipated (typically 60 to 80% of the canopy height i.e. 0.3 m at 11 \nGilchriston), Ra = aerodynamic atmospheric resistance, Rb = sub-laminar boundary 12 \nlayer resistance both found using equations defined by Garland, 1977 and references 13 \ntherein. 14 \nFor a compound which is only deposited, the inverse of Rt is often considered by 15 \nmicrometeorologists to be the deposition velocity, vd (m s-1), and was introduced by 16 \nChamberlain, 1966 as a useful way of parameterising the deposition process: 17 \n vd[z-d] = -Fs[z-d]\/\u03c7[z-d] = -1\/Rt (8.) 18 \nThe reciprocal of a resistance may also be taken to be a conductance (g), by analogy 19 \nwith electrical resistance, and this approach is often taken by plant physiologists who 20 \nmeasure the ability of stomata to take in or release gases as a stomatal conductance in 21 \nmol-gas m-2 s-1 or m s-1. In the following: Rc is calculated using equation (7) where FO3 22 \nhas been measured by eddy-correlation; resistances are used when discussing ozone 23 \ndeposition to the canopy whereas conductance is used for consideration of stomatal (gs) 24 \nresponses, although resistance values are given where appropriate for reference. 25 \nInstrumentation 26 \nThe instrumentation consisted of a mast upon which a sonic anemometer (Gill Solent 27 \nR1012A R2), krypton-hygrometer (Campbell Scientific), fast ozone sensor (CEH 28 \nEdinburgh, ROFI), pyranometer (Skye Instruments), surface wetness (Campbell 29 \nScientific), air temperature and relative humidity sensor (Vaisala HMP45A) were 30 \nmounted. A laptop and Campbell CR23X data logger were placed in weather proof 31 \nenclosures within the crop at the base of the mast to log these instruments. Ozone 32 \nconcentrations were measured using a UV-photometric analyser (Thermo 49C) located in 33 \na nearby cottage (Figure 1b) and logged on a Campbell 21X datalogger. The additional 34 \nmeteorological variables of rainfall (Cassella tipping bucket) and pressure (Vaisala, 35 \nPTB101B) were taken from the Bush monitoring site at CEH Edinburgh (BU; 55.9oN, 36 \n 5\n3.2oW, 180 m asl) 23 km to the west. Soil water content, measured using Campbell TDR 1 \nprobes, at Easter Bush (EB) a grazed field ~300 m from Bush, is also considered. 2 \nThe Rapid Ozone Flux Instrument (ROFI) used to measure the rapid variations in ozone 3 \nconcentrations and thus calculate the ozone flux using the eddy-covariance method was 4 \nmanufactured at CEH Edinburgh. It follows the same principle as the Gusten instrument 5 \n(Gusten, et al., 1992) and was designed to match its specification in terms of flow rates 6 \nand frequency response. Air is rapidly drawn over small disks coated in an ozone 7 \nsensitive dye and the photons emitted are measured using a photomultiplier tube. The 8 \noutput voltage is proportional to the ozone concentration, but the method is not 9 \nquantitative and drifts with time, and so the absolute concentration must also be 10 \nmeasured using another instrument. Ideally this analyser\u2019s inlet would be co-located with 11 \nthe ROFI\u2019s but when (as at Gilchriston) this is not possible measurements made nearby 12 \nare adequate as ozone concentrations vary slowly with distance (Coyle, et al., 2002). The 13 \ncoated disks gradually loose their sensitivity to ozone and so must be replaced 14 \napproximately every 4 days. 15 \nMeasured Stomatal and Non-Stomatal Resistance 16 \nIf transpiration is the only source of water vapour from the surface, i.e. the surface is 17 \ncompletely dry and stomata are open, then the bulk-canopy stomatal resistance to 18 \nwater-vapour transfer (Rs_w) can be estimated using: canopy surface temperature 19 \n(T[z0\u2019]); vapour pressure at height d + z0\u2019, e[z0\u2019]; Ra; Rb_w; \u03bbE and H  (Coe, et al., 1995): 20 \n T[z0\u2019] = T[z-d] + )R]dz[R(\nc\nH\nw_ba\np\n+\u2212\u03c1   (9.);  21 \n e[z0\u2019] = e[z-d] +  )R]dz[R(\nEp\nw_ba +\u2212\u03c1\u03b5  (2); Rs_w = E\n]z[e]]z[T[e\np\n''s 00 \u2212\u03c1\u03b5 ,  (10.) 22 \nwhere  z = reference height (m), d = zero plane displacement height, z0\u2019 = roughness 23 \nlength for dissipation of heat and trace-gases, p = atmospheric pressure (kPa), \u03b5 = ratio 24 \nof the molecular weight of water to that of dry air \u2248 0.62. 25 \nAssuming ozone has zero mesophyll resistance (Rmes, Omasa, et al., 2002), its stomatal 26 \nresistance can be calculated by scaling Rs_w for molecular diffusivity i.e.: 27 \n Rs_wDw = Rs_O3DO3 where D = molecular diffusivity, Dw\/DO3 = 1.51 (Massman, 1998)28 \n (11.) 29 \nThis residual resistance from equation (12) is a combination of Rct, Rinc and Rg only as 30 \nRmes = 0, (Figure 2) termed the non-stomatal resistance: 31 \n Rns =\n1\n3\n11\n\u2212\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\nO_sc RR\n  (12.) 32 \nRs_o3 and Rns in s m-1 can be converted into gs in mmol m-2 s-1 using equation 13. 33 \n 6\n gs = (Rg.T\/(p x 1000)) x 1000\/R where Rg = 8.314 J mol-1 K-1. (13.) 1 \nAs the measurements of Rs_o3 can only be made in dry-daylight conditions the fraction of 2 \ndata suitable for this analysis is greatly reduced (29%). 3 \nData processing and reanalysis 4 \nThe eddy-correlation data were logged at 20.83 Hz on a laptop to allow the online 5 \ncalculation of fluxes every half hour (using a data acquisition programme written in 6 \nLabView, National Instruments), while the other variables were logged on Campbell data 7 \nloggers sampling every 10 seconds and storing 10 minute averages. Standard post-8 \nmeasurement processing procedures were applied to the data. The eddy-correlation 9 \nmeasurements were reanalysed using another LabView program which: 10 \n\u2022 Filtered the time series for large spikes caused by instrument noise. 11 \n\u2022 Applied the planar fit rotation (Wilczak, et al., 2001) to the sonic anemometer 12 \ndata to correct for any misalignment of the instrument with respect to the mean 13 \nwind flow direction. 14 \n\u2022 Corrected the ozone and water-vapour flux for attenuation due to losses at high 15 \nfrequencies, using the method of Horst, 1997. 16 \nFurther filtering was applied: 17 \n\u2022 Eddy-correlation methods can only be applied when there is sufficient turbulence, 18 \nso the ITC statistic (integrated turbulence characteristic, Foken, et al., 2004) is 19 \nused to filter for such conditions (21% of turbulence data were excluded). 20 \n\u2022 The UV-photometric analyser was calibrated at the start and end of the 21 \nexperiment and as it had not changed, no adjustments to the data were required. 22 \nAs part of the review, these data were compared to measurements at Bush and 23 \nwere found to be very similar (mean GT 26.7, BU 28.2 ppb; maximum GT 83.8, 24 \nBU 70.0 ppb; minimum GT 3.3, BU 3.9 ppb; \u03c3 GT 11.4, BU 9.5 ppb; slope 1.01, 25 \nR2 = 0.70), confirming the assumption that ozone varies slowly with distance. 26 \n\u2022 The meteorological measurements were filtered for periods when the instruments 27 \nmay not be functioning correctly, i.e. power failures, site maintenance (15% of 28 \nturbulence data were excluded). 29 \n\u2022 Periods where the ROFI output dropped below 30 mV were excluded from the 30 \nozone time series as the disk was becoming exhausted. 31 \n\u2022 The ozone deposition velocity should be less than the maximum possible (vd_max= 32 \n1\/(Ra + Rb_O3) and so any periods when it exceeded vd_max were excluded from the 33 \nozone time series (7% of ozone deposition data were excluded). 34 \n 7\n\u2022 Dry-daylight conditions for the calculation of stomatal resistance were selected 1 \nusing the criteria \u2013 no rainfall (as recorded at Bush), St > 50 W m-2, dry surface 2 \nconditions, canopy RH < 70%. 3 \nFinally, the time series of each measurement was plotted and visually inspected for 4 \ninconsistencies. Out of a possible total of 1178 half-hourly values, the percentage data 5 \ncapture of the final data set consists of 99 \u2013 100% basic meteorology, 64% turbulence 6 \nand \u03bbE, 45% ozone flux and 29% stomatal resistance. The preceding filters and 7 \nreanalysis are applied to account for known theoretical limits to the technique and ensure 8 \ndata quality. This follows the recommended methods for analysing micrometeorological 9 \ndata (Lee, et al., 2004) and the data capture achieved is consistent with other studies. 10 \nResults 11 \nAt the start of July the weather was warm (~15 oC average air temperature) but 12 \nunsettled with cloud and thundery showers. Between the 7th and the 12th low pressure 13 \nnear Iceland brought unsettled frontal weather with westerly flow and bands of rain 14 \nseparating spells of sunny periods and showers. A large anticyclone developed over 15 \nScotland on the 13th and became slow moving to the east for the next two weeks, 16 \nbringing a long warm, dry spell. Temperatures rose steadily to over 25oC from the 18th, 17 \nwith a peak of 29oC on the 25th, and there were long sunny spells. Eventually, Atlantic 18 \nfronts crossed the country, bringing rain from the 28th to the 2nd of August, thus the 19 \npotatoes received no rainfall between the 11th and 28th of July. The local weather and 20 \nturbulence results reflect these synoptic weather conditions (Figure 3a to d). 21 \nStomatal Conductance 22 \nThe bulk-canopy stomatal conductance for ozone (derived from the water vapour flux, 23 \neqn. (11)) has a mean of 128 mmol-O3 m-2 s-1; summary statistics and the 24 \ncorresponding values calculated as resistances are given in Table 1 while Figure 3e shows 25 \na plot of the time series. Other studies have focused on potato\u2019s physiological responses 26 \nto climatic variables and so used direct measurements of conductance on individual 27 \nleaves. Although there are no similar canopy-level measurements of stomatal 28 \nconductance for ozone reported in the literature, the magnitude is consistent with the 29 \nresults of Avissar, 1993 who reported values ranging from ca. 60 to 600 mmol-O3 m2 s-1 30 \nfor individual leaves at different levels in a potato canopy during dry-daytime periods. 31 \nThe plots of gs_O3 with canopy temperature (Tz0\u2019), vapour pressure deficit (vpd) and solar 32 \nradiation (St) shown in Figure 4 are also consistent with the results of Gordon, et al., 33 \n1997.  34 \nAt the start of the measurements the plants were well watered due to significant rainfall 35 \nin early July (Figure 3d). Stomatal conductance averaged ~250 mmol-O3 m-2 s-1 and the 36 \nlatent heat flux dominated the surface energy balance (Figure 3c). During the dry spell 37 \n 8\ngs_O3 gradually declined to ~70 mmol-O3 m-2 s-1 and latent-heat flux reduced so that 1 \nsensible heat flux tended to be the larger of the two. Although there are no in-situ soil 2 \nwater content measurements at Gilchriston, the data from the Easter Bush grassland, 3 \nwhich is not irrigated, illustrate the likely pattern (Figure 3d) that occurred. As the soil 4 \ndried out and temperatures increased the plants closed their stomata to reduce water 5 \nlosses by transpiration. It was only after a couple of days of significant rainfall that the 6 \nvegetation recovered and latent-heat fluxes began to increase (Figures 3c and e). 7 \nOzone deposition to the canopy 8 \nAs with stomatal conductance there are no other measurements of canopy scale ozone 9 \ndeposition to potato reported in the literature. The mean total flux is -456 ng-O3 m-2 s-1 10 \nand deposition velocity 6.6 mm s-1 (summary statistics are given in Table 1 while the 11 \ndata are plotted in Figure 3f to i) which are similar to fluxes measured over other 12 \nvegetation (e.g. Fowler, et al., 2001; Padro, 1996; Pio, et al., 2000; Rondon, et al., 13 \n1993; Stocker, et al., 1993; Tuovinen, et al., 1998). The hourly median vd and Rc are 14 \nplotted in Figure 5a and b respectively and show typical diurnal cycles, with mid-15 \nafternoon peaks\/troughs respectively (ibid; Garland and Derwent, 1979). These diurnal 16 \ncycles are governed by several processes but mainly: atmospheric turbulence as wind 17 \nspeed and sensible heat flux tend to increase during the day, and so decrease the 18 \natmospheric resistance to deposition (Figure 5c); stomatal conductance peaks just before 19 \nmidday (Figure 5d) when conditions are optimal for the plants (large amounts of 20 \nradiation and low vpd). Stomatal conductance was skewed with respect to solar 21 \nradiation, with larger values during the early morning hours. This is a common 22 \nobservation (e.g. Emberson, et al., 2000) and indicates stomatal closure in the afternoon 23 \nwhen the vpd increased. 24 \nIf stomatal uptake is the main factor controlling ozone deposition to a vegetated surface 25 \nthen we would expect to see total deposition decline as stomatal conductance decreases 26 \nduring the monitoring period. However, although it initially decreases, total ozone 27 \ndeposition does not follow the same trend as gs and peaks during the hot dry period 28 \n(Figure 3h). It has been suggested that non-stomatal ozone deposition is controlled by 29 \nsurface conditions such as leaf temperature, wetness and solar radiation. For example, 30 \nFowler et al. (2001) showed that gns increased with increasing solar radiation over a 31 \nblanket bog in Central Scotland and hypothesised that this was due to the thermal 32 \ndecomposition of ozone on plant leaf surfaces, while Altimir et al. (2004) found that 33 \nozone deposition was enhanced to wet needles of Sitka spruce.  34 \nNight-time Deposition 35 \nIf it is assumed that gs tends towards zero at night then deposition should be mainly 36 \nnon-stomatal at this time (Zhang, et al., 2002). Night-time values of Rc are plotted with 37 \n 9\nfriction velocity, surface temperature and relative humidity in Figure 6. As with plots of gs 1 \nwith environmental variables (Figure 4), there is a lot of scatter in the data, but some 2 \ntrends can be seen; to more clearly detect these, block medians are plotted on the same 3 \ngraphs. As the potato canopy is quite open, it is anticipated that Rc_night will decline with 4 \nincreasing friction velocity (or wind speed) as more air penetrates the canopy and 5 \nincreases the surface area available for deposition. This can be seen in Figure 6a, as 6 \nRc_night clearly declined with increasing u*. Rc_night also varied with RH (Figure 6b), 7 \nincreasing slightly as RH increased up to 60-70% then decreasing with increasing RH. 8 \nThe transition point is similar to that at which hygroscopic-particles tend to dissolve on a 9 \nleaf cuticle and so enhance its wetability (Burkhardt, et al., 1999), so this may be due to 10 \nthe build up of surface water as RH increases: initially, over a very dry surface an 11 \nincrease in humidity forms a thin film of water which occludes sites for ozone deposition 12 \non the leaf cuticle and so increases Rc; at ~70% RH, the deliquescence of previously 13 \ndeposited particles increases the effective thickness of the water layer so aqueous 14 \nreactions can occur which increase ozone deposition and so decrease Rc. There was also 15 \na tendency for Rc_night to decrease with increasing surface temperature, particularly over a 16 \ndry surface (Figure 6c), supporting the hypothesis that thermal decomposition 17 \ncontributes to non-stomatal deposition. 18 \nA cluster of Rc_night values of > 1000 s m-1 are notable in the plots in Figure 6. They all 19 \noccur on the night of 16th to 17th July when the canopy resistance increased markedly 20 \nfrom 400-500 s m-1 to values over 1000 s m-1 (Figure 3g), but the reasons for this are 21 \nnot clear. Dew normally forms at night and so we would expect the surface to be wet and 22 \nso Rc relatively small. The wetness sensor indicates the surface was dry that night but as 23 \nit does not accurately mimic the thermodynamic properties of the leaves (Klemm, et al., 24 \n2002), there may have been some residual moisture present. RH was around 60% where 25 \nit was suggested the deposition process changes from dry-thermal decomposition to 26 \naqueous chemistry. Night-time temperatures had been steadily increasing while RH 27 \ndeclined and so the surface will have been drying out. On the 16th-17th there may only 28 \nbeen a thin film of water present that was not sufficient for the aqueous process, but also 29 \nblocked significant amounts of thermal decomposition occurring on the warm surface. RH 30 \nincreased again on subsequent evenings and Rc_night decreased to more typical values of 31 \n~400 s m-1. It is also possible that the crop was sprayed with a substance that reduced 32 \nthe surface reactivity and so increased Rc, however detailed information on management 33 \nof the crop is not available; the compounds typically applied to potatoes are pyrethroid or 34 \norganophosphorus insecticides and NPK fertilizers for which there have been no studies 35 \nof their surface reactivity with ozone, hence it is not possible to hypothesise further. 36 \n 10\nDay-time Non-stomatal Deposition 1 \nThe non-stomatal resistance can also be estimated using Eq. (12) when there are 2 \nmeasurements of stomatal conductance during dry-daylight hours (St > 50 W m-2, no 3 \nrainfall, surface dry and RH < 70%). These values are plotted against the relevant 4 \nvariables in Figure 7: as with Rc_night there is a lot of scatter in the data but some trends 5 \ncan be detected:  6 \n\u2022 Rns tended to decline with increasing u*; as with Rc_night this was due to an increase in 7 \nthe surface area available for deposition as more air penetrates the canopy and may 8 \nalso come into contact with the soil (Figure 7a). 9 \n\u2022 Rns declined with increasing solar radiation, from ~300 s m-1 below 200 W m-2 to 10 \n~150 s m-1 above 200 W m-2 (Figure 7b); as surface temperature is directly related 11 \nto St this may be due to the proposed thermal decomposition process although 12 \nadditional ozone photolysis on the surface may play a part. Emissions of reactive 13 \nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs) from potatoes have been reported to be negligible 14 \n(Drewitt, et al., 1998) so VOC\/ozone reactions are unlikely to be significant. These 15 \nresults are very similar to the results obtained by Fowler, et al., 2001), following an 16 \nessentially identical response curve (Figure 7e). 17 \n\u2022 The data are very scattered below ~25oC but there is an indication that Rns declined 18 \nwith increasing Tz0\u2019. It was found that there was a transition in surface responses at 19 \nabout 60-70% RH for the night-time data so to exclude these conditions the data was 20 \nfiltered to remove measurements where RH > 60%. This reduced the scatter in the 21 \nRns-Tz0\u2019 response, showing a clearer decrease in Rns with increasing Tz0\u2019 (Figure 7c). 22 \n\u2022 There are limited data of Rns for RH < 70%, but a clear decline in Rns with RH can be 23 \nseen above 50%; below 50% the data are more scattered, but except for the first 24 \ndata point an increase in Rns with RH is evident (Figure 7d). The first data point is the 25 \nmedian of measurements taken over the 16th of July when particularly large night-26 \ntime canopy resistances were measured (the fourth data point is mainly from this 27 \nperiod as well). 28 \nCritical Levels and Stomatal Uptake 29 \nAs part of the UNECE Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) 30 \nseveral expert groups, known as International Cooperative Programmes (ICP) have been 31 \nset up to examine relevant areas of science. One of these is the ICP-Vegetation which 32 \ninvestigates the impacts of air pollutants on crops and (semi-) natural vegetation. The 33 \nuptake based critical level for ozone effects on potato has been set at an AFst6 of 5 mmol 34 \nm-2 PLA (Projected Leaf Area) by ICP-Vegetation (ICP, 2004) where AFst6 is the 35 \naccumulated stomatal uptake over 6 nmol m-2 s-1 during daylight hours for either 36 \n1130\u00b0C-days or 70 days starting at plant emergence. The site was not monitored from 37 \n 11\nsowing of the crop but using a temperature based phenological model (ibid) the 1 \naccumulation period was estimated to be from the 8th of May to the 25th of July (78 days 2 \nfrom emergence). Measurements were not made for all of this period but to exceed the 3 \ncritical level this would require the crop to take up, at least, 68 nmol m-2 PLA per day on 4 \naverage. The maximum daily accumulation measured during the experiment was only 35 5 \nnmol m-2 PLA so it is highly unlikely that this crop suffered any adverse affects from 6 \nozone exposure, according to the flux based approach. However, the AOT40 critical level 7 \n(accumulated concentration over 40 ppb during daylight hours) for the growing season of 8 \nan agricultural crop is set at 3000 ppb h-1 and this was exceeded during the 9 \nmeasurement period, with an AOT40 of 3942 ppb h-1. Therefore an assessment based on 10 \nAOT40 would have predicted some damage to the crop.  11 \nSummary and Conclusions 12 \nA comprehensive dataset of meteorological variables, ozone and water-vapour fluxes 13 \nmeasured over a potato crop have been presented. The measurements show that 14 \nsignificant amounts of ozone are deposited to the surface even when the vegetation is 15 \nnot very active. This shows that non-stomatal sinks are an important pathway for ozone 16 \ndeposition which can equal or exceed stomatal uptake in certain conditions (Figure 8). 17 \nThe non-stomatal sink also varies with surface conditions rather than simply scaling with 18 \nLAI, as is often assumed. 19 \nUsing the night-time data only, it was shown that Rc_night is dependent on surface wetness 20 \nand temperature as well as friction velocity. The dependence on friction velocity is simply 21 \ndue to more air penetrating the canopy as wind speeds increase, and so increasing the 22 \nsurface area available for deposition. Overall Rc_night tends to be smaller when the surface 23 \nis wet (median 211 sm-1) compared with dry (median of 453 s m-1) which is contrary to 24 \nthe common assumption the ozone deposition rates to wet vegetation are small due to 25 \nozone\u2019s poor solubility (e.g. Erisman, et al., 1994). However other studies have shown 26 \nthat some canopies exhibit higher deposition rates when wet, for example Altimir, et al., 27 \n2004; Fuentes, et al., 1994; Grantz, et al., 1995; Pleijel, et al., 1995; Zhang, et al., 28 \n2002. The data indicate three main regimes and possible processes: ozone deposition 29 \nincreasing as the temperature increases on a dry surface due to thermal decomposition; 30 \ndecreased deposition on surfaces with a thin film of water present as thermal 31 \ndecomposition is blocked, when RH \u226460%; enhanced deposition on a fully wetted surface 32 \nas sufficient water is present for aqueous chemistry to occur, RH > 70%. Studies of 33 \nozone deposition to seawater have shown that the presence of dissolved surfactants can 34 \nincrease deposition rates (Chang, et al., 2004; McKay, et al., 1992) and it is likely that 35 \nmany potentially reactive compounds are present in surface water on vegetation. For 36 \nexample ozone can act as an oxidising agent for SO2 in water and if sufficient NH3 is also 37 \n 12\npresent to increase the pH, this could represent a significant sink for O3 (Flechard, et al., 1 \n1999).  2 \nThe dry-daytime non-stomatal resistance, Rns, was also examined in isolation and found 3 \nto exhibit the same relationship with temperature and also to decrease as solar radiation 4 \nincreased. As solar radiation and temperature are closely coupled this may simply be due 5 \nto thermal processes. However, it is possible that other photolytic reactions occur as the 6 \nmedian Rns for a dry surface is lower (median 267 s m-1) than that for a dry night-time 7 \ncanopy (median 453 s m-1). The relationship of Rns to St is virtually identical to that 8 \nobserved by Fowler, et al., 2001 for a moorland canopy indicating that similar processes 9 \nare occurring at both sites. 10 \nThe measurements of Rns are restricted to dry periods, for which Rs could be estimated,  11 \nhence, fully wetted surfaces cannot be examined. However, the relationship of Rns with 12 \nRH is similar to that seen for Rc_night indicating that the day-time processes are similar, 13 \nalthough the transition point may occur at slightly lower relative humidity (50-60%). 14 \nThese processes may be occurring on both the external parts of the plants and the soil 15 \nsurface beneath the plant as studies have shown soil deposition rates can depend on soil 16 \nmoisture and chemistry (Chang, et al., 2002; Sorimachi and Sakamoto, 2007; Wesely, et 17 \nal., 1981). However as the surface area of vegetation greatly exceeds the soil area and 18 \nits density inhibits turbulent transfer to the soil, is assumed that most of the deposition 19 \noccurs on the upper parts of the plants. To more clearly understand the processes 20 \ninvolved in ozone deposition to leaf cuticles or soil alone, controlled chamber studies are 21 \nrequired. These will allow variables such as surface chemistry, humidity, temperature 22 \nand radiation to be independently examined. Some initial experiments of this type have 23 \nbeen undertaken (Hamilton, et al., 2007) and indicated that surface temperature was 24 \nindeed a controlling variable: ozone deposition increased with temperature on stainless 25 \nsteel, aluminium foil and wax surfaces. 26 \nAt present, many models use the formula of Wesely, 1989 where:  27 \n Rns = Rext\/SAI, SAI = surface area index \u2248 LAI, for ozone Rext = 2500 s m-1 (14.) 28 \ngiving a Rns of 833 s m-1 for a typical potato crop with LAI ~3 m-2 m-2. This is significantly 29 \ngreater than the median value observed in this study of only 170 s m-1, although the 30 \nresults do vary greatly with a standard deviation of 724 s m-1. Zhang, et al., 2002 31 \nproposed a new model for Rns based on an analysis of night-time resistances for a range 32 \nof vegetation types (mixed forest, deciduous forest, corn, soy bean and pasture). 33 \nAlthough temperature was not considered as a controlling variable their results are 34 \nsimilar to those found here in that Rns was smaller by ~50% for wet compared to dry 35 \nsurfaces and it declined with u* and RH. Applying this model to our data gave better 36 \nestimates than using a simple SAI formula in that it correlated with the measured Rc_night 37 \n 13\nfor some periods but still overestimated Rc_night for much of time, giving median values of 1 \n904 and 573 s m-1 for wet and dry surfaces, respectively. 2 \nA change in model parameterisation is not suggested here as measurements from a 3 \nwider range of sites and conditions should be used but these results show that such an 4 \nexercise should be undertaken. To fully examine and parameterise surface processes, 5 \nmeasurements or models of stomatal conductance need to be included to allow day-night 6 \ndifferences to be assessed. Although there are few measurements for potatoes there are 7 \nmany other datasets for different vegetation types that could be utilised. 8 \nThe measurements do not imply damage based on the AFst6 critical level, despite the 9 \nfact that the AOT40 limit value is exceeded. This finding highlights the inconsistency 10 \ncaused by using an atmospheric concentration based approach as although ozone 11 \nconcentrations may be large, stomatal uptake which causes the damage may be small. 12 \nThis is particularly evident during warm-dry conditions which favour ozone production but 13 \nreduce stomatal opening, as occurred during these measurements, even at a NW 14 \nEuropean site located in a climate where drought is not normally considered to be a 15 \nlimitation to stomatal functioning. 16 \n 17 \nAcknowledgements 18 \nWe are very grateful to: Mr Keith Maxwell of Gilchriston Farm for allowing us to use his 19 \nfield and providing access to mains electricity; the contractors, Crop Chemicals (Drem, 20 \nEast Lothian, Scotland), for letting us know when the dehaulming would occur and giving 21 \nus time to remove the equipment; CEH for funding the work from the institute\u2019s budget 22 \nand Defra for providing funding from project 1\/3\/201 (Ozone Umbrella: Effects of 23 \nGround-level Ozone on (Upland) Vegetation in the UK).  24 \nReferences 25 \nAltimir, N., Tuovinen, J.
