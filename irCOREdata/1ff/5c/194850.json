INTRODUCTION\n1H 0419\u0001577 (also known as LB 1727) is a radio-quiet\n(8.4 GHz flux\u00023mJy; Brissenden et al. 1987) Seyfert galaxy at\na redshift z \u0002 0:104. Optical spectra from the Anglo-Australian\nTelescope (AAT; Turner et al. 1999) and ESO (Guainazzi et al.\n1998) showed 1H 0419\u0001577 to be a typical broad-line Seyfert 1\nwith a strong big blue bump (BBB). It has been widely studied\nat X-ray energies and was found to exhibit an unusual degree\nof spectral variability. A short pn camera observation early in\nthe XMM-Newton program reported a \u2018\u2018typical\u2019\u2019 Seyfert 1 X-ray\nspectrum with a power law of photon index \u0001 \u0002 1:9 together\nwith a strong soft excess (Page et al. 2002). Using the H\u0001 line\nwidth from Grupe et al. (2004) and the relationship with black\nhole mass of Kaspi et al. (2000), we estimate a supermassive\nblack hole (SMBH) of 1:3 ; 108 M\u0003. The [O iii] 5007 8 line\nwidth measure of the stellar velocity dispersion (Nelson 2000)\ngives a very similar figure.\nTo improve the X-ray data on 1H 0419\u0001577 a new series\nof five XMM-Newton observations was carried out at approx-\nimately 3 month intervals over the period 2002 September\nto 2003 September. The first of those new observations, when\n1H 0419\u0001577 was found to be in an extremely faint state, has\nbeen reported in Pounds et al. (2004b, hereafter Paper I). Three\npoints of particular note resulting from this first new XMM-\nNewton observation of 1H 0419\u0001577 were that (1) an unusu-\nally hard (flat) power-law fit (\u0001 \u0002 1:0) to the EPIC data over the\n2\u201310 keV band also exhibited curvature indicative of an ex-\ntreme relativistic Fe K emission line or partial covering of the\ncontinuum by a substantial column of \u2018\u2018cold\u2019\u2019 gas; (2) although\nthe XMM-Newton RGS features were faint, the unambiguous\ndetection of emission lines of O vii and O viii provided clear\nevidence for an extended region of photoionized gas in the\nnucleus of 1H 0419\u0001577; and (3) a comparison of the raw EPIC\ndata with data obtained in 2000 December, when 1H 0419\u0001577\nwas considerably brighter in the X-ray band, showed that the\nlarge-scale spectral variability in 1H 0419\u0001577 could be de-\nscribed by a variable, steep (\u0001 \u0002 2:5) power-law component.\nIn the present paper we analyze the remaining four observa-\ntions from the new XMM-Newton campaign (in 2002 December\nand 2003 March, June, and September), which together ex-\nplore the X-ray spectrum of 1H 0419\u0001577 over a range of flux\nstates lying between the extremes of 2000 December and 2002\nSeptember.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND X-RAY DATA\nThe new observations took place on 2002 December 27\n(orbit 558) and 2003 March 30 (orbit 605), June 25 (orbit 649)\nand September 16 (orbit 690), with on-target exposures of\u000210.2,\n\u000213.9,\u000213.1, and\u000213.9 ks, respectively. X-ray data were avail-\nable throughout each observation from the EPIC pn (Stru\u00a8der\net al. 2001) and MOS (Turner et al. 2001) cameras and the RGS\n(den Herder et al. 2001). These new data add to the earlier XMM-\nNewton observations of 1H 0419\u0001577 on 2000 December 4\n(orbit 181) and 2002 September 5 (orbit 512), when the source\nwas found to be in historically high- and low-flux states, re-\nspectively. Those earlier observations have been reported in\nPage et al. (2002) and in Paper I.\nEPIC data were initially screened with the XMM-Newton\nSAS version 5.4 software, and events corresponding to patterns\n0\u20134 (single- and double-pixel events) were selected for the\npn data and patterns 0\u201312 were selected for MOS1 and MOS2,\nthe latter then being combined. A low-energy cut of 300 eV\nwas applied to all EPIC data, and known hot or bad pixels were\nremoved. Source counts were obtained from a circular region\nof 4500 radius centered on 1H 0419\u0001577, with the background\nbeing taken from a similar region offset from, but close to,\nthe source. The X-ray light curve of 1H 0419\u0001577 was essen-\ntially flat throughout each observation, and the background rate\nwas low (except in orbit 558, when noisy data were edited out).\nWe therefore integrated each data set for spectral analysis.\nA\n1 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester, Leicester\nLE1 7RH, UK; kap@star.le.ac.uk.\n2 Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics, Code 662, NASA Goddard\nSpace Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771.\n3 Universities Space Research Association.\n696\nThe Astrophysical Journal, 616:696\u2013706, 2004 December 1\n# 2004. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved. Printed in U.S.A.\nIndividual EPIC spectra were binned to a minimum of 100 counts\nper energy bin to facilitate the use of the \u00022 minimization tech-\nnique in spectral fitting and ensure adequate statistics in the\n5\u201310 keV band. Spectral fitting was based on the XSPEC pack-\nage (Arnaud 1996), and all fits included absorption due to the\nline-of-sight Galactic column NH \u00bc 2 ;1020 cm\u00012. Errors are\nquoted at the 90% confidence level (\u0002\u00022 \u00bc 2:7 for one inter-\nesting parameter).\nWe were fortunate to observe 1H 0419\u0001577 in widely dif-\nfering flux states, ranging conveniently between the low- and\nhigh-flux state extremes reported previously. Figure 1 shows\nthe background-subtracted (pn camera) spectral data for all\nsix observations, compared with a mean power law fit (at 2\u2013\n10 keV) of \u0001 \u00bc 1:73. The plot shows very clearly that the\nlargest flux variation occurs in the soft X-ray band, with all spec-\ntra converging above \u00025 keV. The only significance we would\nclaim for the mean power-law fit is in the spectral index be-\ning close to the canonical value for Seyfert 1 galaxies (for fits\nexcluding reflection; Nandra & Pounds 1994), suggesting that\nthis unusually variable active galactic nucleus (AGN) has an\naverage X-ray spectrum typical of the class. Retaining our\nprevious descriptions of the orbit 181 and 512 data as high-\nand low-flux states, respectively, we now define orbit 558 as\n\u2018\u2018mid-low,\u2019\u2019 orbit 605 as \u2018\u2018mid-high,\u2019\u2019 and group orbits 649 and\n690 together to give a well-defined \u2018\u2018intermediate\u2019\u2019 flux state\nspectrum.\nIn the following analysis spectral parameters are quoted in\nthe rest frame of 1H 0419\u0001577, while figures (except Fig. 10)\nretain the observed photon energy scale. In general, we have\nfitted the pn and MOS data simultaneously, with only the power-\nlaw parameters untied, reflecting the well-known systematic\ndifference in deduced continuum slopes.\n3. SPECTRAL FITTING OF THE INTERMEDIATE-FLUX\nSTATE EPIC DATA\nWe began the EPIC spectral analysis in the conventional way\nby fitting a power law over the hard X-ray (2\u201310 keV) band,\naiming thereby to minimize the effects of soft X-ray emission\nand\/or low-energy absorption. This fit yielded a photon index\nof \u0001 \u00bc 1:60\u0004 0:01 (pn) and \u0001 \u00bc 1:55\u0004 0:02 (MOS). Statis-\ntically, the simple power-law fit was quite good, with \u00022 of 393\nfor 357 degrees of freedom (dof ). The most obvious residual\nspectral feature is a weak emission line observed just below\n\u00026 keV (Fig. 2, top). The addition of a Gaussian emission line\nFig. 1.\u2014EPIC spectral data from the observations of 2000 December, or-\nbit 181 (black); 2002 September, orbit 512 (red); 2002 December, orbit 558\n(green); 2003 March, orbit 605 ( purple); 2003 June, orbit 649 (light blue);\nand 2003 September, orbit 690 (magenta); compared (at 2\u201310 keV) with a\npower law of photon index \u0001 \u00bc 1:73.

[See the electronic\nedition of the Journal for a color version of this figure.]\nXMM-NEWTON OBSERVATION OF 1H 0419\u0001577 697\nimproved the fit (to \u00022 \u00bc 373=353 dof ), with a line energy\n(in the AGN rest frame) of 6:25\u0004 0:12 keV, rms width \u0003 \u00bc\n320\u0004 150 eV, Cux \u00bc 1:5\u0004 0:6\u00f0 \u00de ; 10\u00015 photons s\u00011 cm\u00012,\nand EW \u00bc 100\u0004 40 eV.\nExtending this spectral fit to 0.3 keV revealed the strong\nexcess below \u00021 keV (Fig. 2, middle). The addition of black-\nbody components of kT \u0002 110 and \u0002250 eV modeled the soft\nexcess quite well, but it was necessary to add (ad hoc) absorp-\ntion edges at \u00020.62 keV (\u0004 \u0002 0:22), \u00020.74 keV (\u0004 \u0002 0:26),\nand \u00020.90 keV (\u0004 \u0002 0:10) to achieve a statistically acceptable\nfit (\u00022 \u00bc 825=783 dof ). Figure 3 reproduces this \u2018\u2018conven-\ntional\u2019\u2019 fit to the intermediate-flux level data for 1H 0419\u0001577,\nwhich we note has model parameters typical for a luminous\nSeyfert 1 galaxy.\nThe above spectral fitting allowed the mean X-ray fluxes of\nthe intermediate-state spectrumof 1H0419\u0001577 to be determined.\nThese were 5:9 ;10\u000112 ergs s\u00011 cm\u00012 (0.3\u20131 keV), 3:0 ;\n10\u000112 ergs s\u00011 cm\u00012 (1\u20132 keV), and 1:05 ; 10\u000111 ergs s\u00011 cm\u00012\n(2\u201310 keV). Combining these fluxes yields an intermediate-\nstate 0.3\u201310 keV luminosity for 1H 0419\u0001577 of 4:3 ; 1044 ergs\ns\u00011 (H0 \u00bc 75 km s\u00011 Mpc\u00011).\n4. AN ALTERNATIVE SPECTRAL FIT\nTO THE INTERMEDIATE-FLUX STATE SPECTRUM\nOur main aim in the present study is to better understand the\nlarge-scale spectral variability of 1H 0419\u0001577, and thereby of\nAGNs more generally. In Paper I we found that the difference\nspectrum between high- and low-state EPIC pn data (the high-\nflux difference spectrum) could be well fitted by a power law\nof \u0001 \u0002 2:5, steepening to \u00022.7 above \u00022 keV. This simple fit\nsuggested that the low-state spectrum (hard power law plus soft\nexcess) might represent a nonvarying core emission, leaving\nthe main spectral change to be represented by the variable-flux\npower-law component. To further explore that possibility, we\nnow reanalyze the new intermediate-flux state EPIC data, after\nsubtracting the 2002 September data, to yield the intermediate-\nstate difference spectrum.\nWe find that the resulting intermediate-state difference\nspectrum is similar to the high-state difference spectrum, with a\nmean 0.3\u201310 keV power-law index of \u0001 \u0002 2:41 (pn), steep-\nening to \u00022.85 when fitted above \u00022 keV. However, the fit is\nmuch less good (\u00022 \u00bc 1174=799 dof ), owing to a broad deficit\nof flux at \u00020.5\u20131 keV (Fig. 4, top). If the large-scale spectral\nvariability in 1H 0419\u0001577 is indeed well modeled by a steep,\nvariable-flux power law, as proposed in our previous analysis\nof the high-state difference spectrum (Paper I), the new data\nsuggest that the variable emission component is modified by\nabsorption in intermediate-flux states. To model that possibility\nFig. 3.\u2014Unfolded broadband spectrum fitted to the intermediate-flux state\ndata for 1H 0419\u0001577.

[See the\nelectronic edition of the Journal for color versions of parts of this figure.]\nPOUNDS ET AL.698 Vol. 616\nwe then compared the intermediate-state difference spectrum\nwith a power law plus a photoionized absorber, represented by\nXSTAR (Kallman et al. 1996). Here the absorption is com-\npared with a grid of ionized absorbers, with column density,\nionization parameter \u0005 (\u0005 \u00bc L=nr2, where n is the gas density\nat a distance r from the ionizing source of luminosity L), and\noutflow (or inflow) velocity as variable parameters. All abun-\ndant elements from C to Fe are included, with the relative abun-\ndances as further variable parameters. The resulting fit was good\n(\u00022 of 839\/790), with a column density NH \u0002 4 ;1021 cm\u00012 of\nlow-ionization gas ( log \u0005 \u00bc \u00011:7\u0004 0:4). The relative abun-\ndances of the key elements, of C, N, O, Ne, Mg, and Fe, were\n0.7, 0.9, 0.20, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.0, although only O, Ne, and Fe\nwere well constrained in the fit. This best fit was obtained with\na redshift corresponding to 1H 0419\u0001577, implying that the\nsubstantial column of cold absorbing gas is local to 1H 0419\u0001\n577. The power-law slopes in the fit increased to \u0001 \u0002 2:8 (pn)\nand \u0001 \u0002 2:7 (MOS), while still leaving a further spectral steep-\nening above \u00023 keV (Fig. 4, bottom). Figure 4 (middle) illus-\ntrates the relevant XSTAR model, in which the absorption\nstructure is dominated by continuum absorption, in increasing\nphoton energy, of C, O, Fe, and Ne.\n4.1. The Form of the Variable Emission Component\nIn the above spectral fit we assumed that the variable emis-\nsion component in 1H 0419\u0001577 has the form of a power law.\nA similar conclusion was proposed from an ASCA study of the\nSeyfert 1 galaxy MCG \u00016-30-15 (Shih et al. 2002) and sup-\nported by extended XMM-Newton observations of the same\nsource (Fabian&Vaughan 2003). However, it is notable that for\n1H 0419\u0001577 the power-law fit including absorption (Fig. 4,\nbottom) indicates further steepening above \u00023 keV, and we\nrecall that the compTT model (Titarchuk 1994) gave an even\nbetter fit to the high-state difference spectrum reported in Pa-\nper I. Figure 5 reproduces the residuals to the single power-\nlaw and compTT fits to the high-state difference spectrum. The\nthermal Comptonization model has the additional appeal of be-\ning more physical than a power-law fit. Since the intrinsic cur-\nvature of the thermal continuum might significantly affect the\nderived absorption parameters, we therefore repeated the anal-\nysis of the intermediate-state difference spectrum with a model\ninvolving the emergence of a cool Comptonized emission com-\nponent modified by absorption in ionized matter.\nReplacing the power law of x 4 with a Comptonized emis-\nsion component with an initial temperature of kT \u0002 2:7 keV\nand optical depth \u00024.4, as found for the high-flux difference\nspectrum, the fit was indeed better than for the power-law\nmodel, though still poor (\u00022 \u00bc 1102=796 dof ), with data:\nmodel residuals similar to those for the power-law fit in Figure 4\n(top). Photoionized absorption represented by XSTARwas then\nadded to the model. The outcome was a very good fit (\u00022 \u00bc\n828=784 dof ) for a Comptonized emission component of kT \u00bc\n2:3\u0004 0:4 keVand optical depth 4:5\u0004 0:7. The absorption was\nagain well modeled by low-ionization matter, with a column\ndensity of NH \u0002 4:4 ;1021 cm\u00012 and an ionization parameter\nof log \u0005 \u00bc \u00011:8\u0004 0:3. The relative abundances of the key el-\nements of C, N, O, Ne, Mg, and Fe, were 0.2, 0.2, 0.12, 0.4, 0.7,\nand 0.66, respectively, with the lower abundances of C and N\n(compared with the power-law fit) adjusting to the low-energy\ncurvature in the continuum fit.\nFigure 6 (top) shows the best-fit Comptonized emission com-\nponent and pn camera data for the intermediate-flux difference\nspectrum, with the XSTAR absorption component removed.\nFigure 6 (middle) reproduces the model spectrum, while Fig-\nure 6 (bottom) illustrates the quality of the resulting fit.\n5. SPECTRAL FITS TO THE MID-LOW\u2013FLUX\nSTATE SPECTRUM\nTaken together with the high-state difference spectrum re-\nported in Paper I, the above analysis of the intermediate-state\ndifference spectrum suggests that the large-scale spectral var-\niability of 1H 0419\u0001577 is indeed due to an emerging emission\ncomponent that, at intermediate-flux levels, bears the imprint\nof absorption by low ionization matter. To see if that trend of\nvariable absorption with flux level is continuous, we repeated\nthe above analysis for the mid-low\u2013flux state observation, but\nagain starting with a conventional power law plus blackbody\nfit.\nFitting a power law over the hard X-ray (2\u201310 keV) band\nyielded a photon index of \u0001 \u00bc 1:41\u0004 0:03 (pn) and \u0001 \u00bc\n1:35\u0004 0:06 (MOS) for the mid-low\u2013flux spectrum. Extend-\ning this fit to 0.3 keV showed a soft excess rising sharply be-\nlow \u00020.7 keV (Fig. 7, top). The narrower profile of this soft\nexcess (compared with that in Fig. 2, top) allowed it to be well\nmodeled by the addition of a single blackbody component\nof kT \u0002 102 eV, no hotter blackbody being required. In this\ncase a single absorption edge (\u0004 \u0002 0:8 at 0:76 \u0004 0:01 keV)\nwas needed to complete an excellent fit (\u00022 \u00bc 245=244 dof ).\nFigure 7 (middle) shows the ratio of data to this power-law,\nblackbody, and absorption edge model. In summary, a conven-\ntional fit to the mid-low\u2013flux spectrum of 1H 0419\u0001577 shows\na hard (flat) power law with a sharply rising (cool) soft excess\nand a deep absorption edge at \u00020.76 keV (in the AGN rest\nframe).\nThe above fit provided a measure of the X-ray fluxes and\nluminosity of 1H 0419\u0001577 in the mid-low\u2013flux state, which\nFig. 5.\u2014Top: Ratio of high-state difference spectrum (2000 December)\nto a single power-law model of photon index 2.47.

The relatively\npoor statistics meant that the Comptonization parameters were\nnot well defined, the best fit having a temperature kT \u00bc 2:1\u0004\n1:5 keV and optical depth 2:7\u0004 2. However, the continuum\nfit was adequate to show the absorption trough to be noticeably\ndeeper in the mid-low\u2013state difference spectrum (Fig. 8, top).\nFitting this absorption with XSTAR, with abundances fixed at\nthe values found in the intermediate-state model, again produced\nan acceptable fit (\u00022 \u00bc 259=238 dof ), with a column density\nof NH \u0002 2 ;1022 cm\u00012 and an ionization parameter of log \u0005 \u00bc\n\u00012:3\u0004 0:3.While the ionization parameters of the intermediate\nand mid-low difference spectra are the same within the formal\nerrors, we see below that the lower ionization in the mid-low\u2013\nflux state spectrum is critical to understanding the different\nshape of the absorption trough in the two spectra. Figure 8 (mid-\ndle) reproduces the XSTAR model, and Figure 8 (bottom)\nshows the data:model residuals for the mid-low difference\nspectrum fit.\n6. THE FORM OF THE VARIABLE ABSORPTION\nThe above difference spectrum fits indicate that absorption\nin low-ionization matter is substantially modifying the variable\nemission component and hence the overall observed X-ray\nspectrum of 1H 0419\u0001577; furthermore, we find the absorbing\nmatter to become more ionized and the column density to fall\nas the continuum flux rises. To further explore the variable\nabsorber we then computed the ratio of the \u2018\u2018raw\u2019\u2019 intermediate-\nand mid-low\u2013flux spectra. The shape of that ratio plot (Fig. 9,\ntop) is particularly interesting, the marked drop observed at\n\u00020.7 keV coinciding with low-ionization Fe absorption edges,\nwith no obvious change in the flux ratio at the corresponding\nedges of low-ionization oxygen. The flux ratio plot is thus\nconsistent with the specific XSTAR models that match the rela-\ntively deeper absorption edge near 0.7 keV with the lower ion-\nization parameter for the lower flux state spectrum (cf. Figs. 6,\nmiddle, and 8, middle). A weaker feature at \u00020.9 keV in Fig-\nure 9 (top), close to the absorption edge structure of Ne, is also\nqualitatively consistent with the individual XSTAR fits. Fig-\nure 9 (bottom) shows the ratio of the mid-high\u2013 to high-flux\nstate spectra, indicating that the same pattern of decreasing ab-\nsorption continues as the flux level of 1H 0419\u0001577 rises to-\nward the high state.\nThe different profile of the absorption in the intermediate-\nand mid-low\u2013state difference spectral fits is determined by\nthe changing ionization parameter. To better understand that\nchange we replot the key section of each XSTAR model fit\nin Figure 10, where for ease of comparison with listed edges\nthe energy axes are adjusted to the rest frame of 1H 0419\u0001577\nand the principal absorbing ion stages are noted against the\nrespective absorption features.

Furthermore, while remaining\nlow the ionization state of the absorber increases as 1H 0419\u0001\n577 gets brighter, while the absorbing column (or perhaps the\ncovering factor) simultaneously decreases, and the increasing\nionization parameter provides a natural explanation of the chang-\ning energy profile of the absorption trough.\n7. SPECTRAL LINES IN THE RGS DATA\nGiven the above evidence for substantial absorbing matter\nmodifying the EPIC spectrum, it is of obvious importance to\ncheck whether this is consistent with the higher resolution RGS\ndata. To pursue that question we examined the simultaneous\nFig. 8.\u2014Top: Comptonized emission component and pn camera data for the\nmid-low\u2013state difference spectrum of 1H 0419\u0001577.

Figure 11 displays the\nRGS-1 and RGS-2 fluxed spectrum, binned relatively coarsely\nat 85 m8. The only spectral lines detected are all in emission,\nalthough the broad deficit between \u000210 and 20 8 is qualita-\ntively consistent with the absorption trough seen in the EPIC\nspectra. The narrower absorption feature observed near 17.5 8\nis also consistent with the Fe 2\u20133 unresolved transition array\n(UTA; Behar et al. 2001) indicated in the XSTAR model fits\n(Fig. 10). The zero-velocity wavelengths of the principal K-shell\nemission lines and radiative recombination continua (RRC)\nfalling in the 8\u201338 8 waveband are indicated on the figure, and\nseveral are clearly detected.\nTo quantify the individual spectral features, we modeled the\nRGS data with a simple power law, with \u0001 \u0002 2:45 yielding\na reasonably good continuum fit (\u00022 \u00bc 4264=4084) over the\n8\u201338 8 band, and then added Gaussians to each candidate\nemission line in turn, with wavelength, line width, and flux as\nfree parameters. Four emission lines were formally detected,\nthose of O viii Ly\u0006, the resonance (r) and forbidden (f ) lines of\nthe O vii 1s\u20132p triplet, and the forbidden line of N vi, together\nwith the RRC of O vii. Table 1 lists the results. Interestingly,\nthe Gaussian line fittings support the visible impression from\nthe fluxed spectra that the profiles of the resonance lines of\nO vii and O viii are resolved, the best-fit line widths corre-\nsponding to a velocity width of 7000 \u0004 3000 km s\u00011.\nFigure 12 (top) shows the O vii and O viii lines at a higher\nresolution (35 m8 bin width) and is compared in Figure 12\n(bottom) with the same spectral region observed in the low-state\nspectrum. Because of the much poorer statistics the latter fluxed\nspectrum is more coarsely binned, at 170 m8, and shows why\nonly the O viii Ly\u0006 and O vii (f ) lines were identified in the\nearlier analysis of the low-state RGS spectrum (Paper I). The\nimproved statistics of the full spectrum now allows the O vii (r)\nline to be resolved, although the total line fluxes remain con-\nsistent (within a factor \u00021.5) with those observed in the low-\nflux state (Paper I). That consistency is significant in the context\nof our identification of a constant core soft emission (x 9), since\nthe observed overall \u00020.3\u20131 keV flux, including the variable\ncontinuum component, varies by a factor \u00024 over the five new\nXMM-Newton observations (Fig. 1).\n8. RECONCILING THE RGS AND EPIC SPECTRA\nThe most important finding from our analysis of the EPIC\nspectra is of a substantial column density of low-ionizationmat-\nter affecting the strongly variable emission component.\nFig. 11.\u2014RGS spectrum of 1H 0419\u0001577 summed over all five new\nXMM-Newton observations.

Bottom: The same spectral band from the low-flux state\nobservation of 1H 0419\u0001577 binned at 170 m8 resolution. The peak near\n23 8 is due to imperfect modeling of the O-K absorption edge in the detector\nresponse function.\nPOUNDS ET AL.702 Vol. 616\nAt first sight, the RGS data seem to be in conflict with the\nabove picture, since no narrow absorption features are ob-\nserved, even though the EPIC ratio spectra (Fig. 9, bottom)\nshow significant broadband absorption remaining up to the\nmid-high\u2013flux state. However, we note that the RGS is de-\nsigned to detect emission and absorption lines and is much less\nsensitive than EPIC in detecting continuum absorption. It is\nalso possible that the absorbing material, if located close to\nthe continuum emission region, is velocity broadened. In that\ncontext we note that the O vii and O viii resonance emission\nlines are marginally resolved, suggesting an origin in moder-\nately ionized matter with a velocity width of 7000 \u0004 3000 km\ns\u00011, while it is conceivable that a still higher velocity or more\nturbulent outflow at smaller radii is responsible for the main\nabsorption in the EPIC difference spectra. The width of the\nFe K line in the intermediate-state spectrum (x 3) indicates such\na higher velocity dispersion if interpreted as arising from\nfluorescence in the overlying absorber.\nTo check for comparable absorption edge structure in the\nRGS data we subtracted the low-state data from the summed\nspectra for 2003 March, June, and September, producing an\nintermediate-state RGS difference spectrum, which we plot in\nFigure 13 against a simple power-law model. With coarser\nbinning (than in Fig. 11), the plot is consistent with absorp-\ntion edges similar to those found in the XSTAR fits to the\nintermediate-state EPIC difference spectrum (Fig. 6, middle),\nalthough the statistics are not good enough to usefully constrain\nany velocity-broadened edges.\n9. A REAPPRAISAL OF THE SOFT X-RAY EXCESS\nModeling the soft excess (conventionally defined as the\nexcess soft X-ray flux above an extrapolation of the 2\u201310 keV\npower law) with one or more blackbodies, as in x 3, is a com-\nmon practice in X-ray astronomy. However, since the implied\nblackbody temperatures are much higher than are appropriate\nfor an AGN accretion disk, a common explanation is that\nthe disk photons gain energy by electron scattering in a hotter\n\u2018\u2018skin\u2019\u2019 or a corona lying above the disk. Nevertheless, such\nComptonization models have remained rather ad hoc. Re-\ncently, a scaling by black hole mass of (more robust) Comp-\ntonization models for Galactic black hole sources (Done &\nGierlinski 2003) failed to explain the sharp upturn often seen\nbelow \u00021 keV in AGN spectra. Noting also the similar shape\n(or blackbody temperature) of soft excess in AGNs over a wide\nluminosity range, those authors proposed that the soft excess in\nAGNs could be an artifact of \u2018\u2018unseen or ignored\u2019\u2019 absorption\n(Gierlinski & Done 2004).\nThe idea that absorption could be playing a larger part than\nthat normally assumed in shaping the broadband spectra of\nSeyfert 1 galaxies was put forward in an early minisurvey of\nXMM-Newton observations by Pounds & Reeves (2004). In\nFigure 1 of Pounds & Reeves (2004) we showed the similarity\nin the observed broadband spectra of AGNs over a wide lu-\nminosity range, while noting that the more luminous sources\nexhibited a more gradual onset of the soft excess. In comparing\nthe present EPIC spectra of 1H 0419\u0001577 we now find the\nsame qualitative trend with flux level for an individual AGN.\nFigure 14 compares the apparent soft excess above a 2\u201310 keV\npower law for the five flux states of 1H 0419\u0001577, with the\nhigher flux states showing a more gradual (or hotter) soft excess.\nOur present analysis suggests that the \u2018\u2018conventional\u2019\u2019 soft\nexcess is indeed strongly affected by absorption. The addi-\ntional point to emphasize here is that the individual difference\nspectra for high, intermediate, and mid-low states of 1H 0419\u0001\n577 exhibit no soft excess. Instead, we identify a core soft\nX-ray emission component in the extreme low-flux observation\nof September 2002 (Paper I). Thermal emission from the ac-\ncretion disk modified by scattering in a hotter skin or corona\nand reflection from a hot inner disk surface are possible con-\ntributors to this core soft component. However, our present\nanalysis of 1H 0419\u0001577, with evidence for a substantial col-\numn of cold nuclear gas becoming less opaque as the X-ray\nflux increases, suggests that recombination emission from as-\nsociated photoionized (and possibly outflowing) matter is a\nnatural origin of the soft excess. To test that idea we can com-\npare the core soft excess observed in the XMM-Newton low-\nstate observation of 1H 0419\u0001577 with an emission model\ngrid from XSTAR.\nAs with the absorption grids, the ionizing continuum is a\npower law of energy index \u00011. The key variable parameters in\nthis test were the ionization state and the relative metal abun-\ndances, which essentially determine the emission spectrum for\ncomparison with the overall shape of low-state soft excess ob-\nserved in EPIC and with the (few) strongest features identified\nin the RGS spectrum.\nFigure 15 (top) shows the soft X-ray emission component,\nillustrated by removal of the blackbody and Gaussian emission\nline attributed to a blend of the O vii triplet and O viii Ly\u0006\nfrom the broadband fit to the low-flux state EPIC spectrum\ndiscussed in Paper I. Quantitatively, the X-ray flux in that soft\nexcess (0.3\u20131 keV) is \u00021:3 ;10\u000112 ergs s\u00011, with some 30%\nof the flux removed by the low-energy absorption trough in\nFig. 13.\u2014Coarsely binned RGS intermediate-state difference spectrum of\n1H 0419\u0001577 plotted against a power law to illustrate absorption edge struc-\ntures consistent with those seen in the simultaneous EPIC spectrum.

Replacing the blackbody and O-K emission com-\nponents with a grid of photoionized emission models in XSTAR\nproduced a statistically good fit (\u00022 \u00bc 1028=1058 dof ); i.e., it\nwas able to reproduce the shape of the core soft emission, with\nan ionization parameter log \u0005 \u0002 1:3 and element abundances for\nC, N, O, Ne, and Fe (relative to solar) of 0.4, 0.4, 0.15, 0.35,\nand 0.45, respectively. We note that the ratio of the key ele-\nments, O and Fe, suggests an overabundance of Fe similar to\nthat found in the absorption modeling. Figure 15 (bottom) re-\nproduces the fitted XSTAR emission spectrum, showing how\nthe emission profile, attenuated by the Galactic absorption in the\nline of sight to 1H 0419\u0001577, matches the strongly peaked soft\nexcess in Figure 15 (top). It may also be understood, qualita-\ntively, how the only lines detected in the full RGS spectrum of\n1H 0419\u0001577, velocity broadened in the figure by a Gaussian\nwidth of \u0003 \u0002 5 eV, are the principal emission lines of O vii,\nO viii, N vi, and C vi.\nFinally, it is interesting to compare the Fe K line in the model\nof Figure 15 (bottom) with the emission line detected in the\nintermediate-flux state EPIC data (Figs. 2, top, and 3). Relative\nto the resonance lines of O vii and O viii, the XSTAR model\nyields an Fe line that is a factor of \u000210 weaker and centered at\n\u00026.42 keV (corresponding to Fe xvii) compared with the EPIC\nline energy of 6:25 \u0004 0:12 keV. It seems probable, therefore,\nthat the bulk of the observed Fe K line arises by fluorescence\nin low-ionization matter, with the absorbing column being an\nobvious candidate. In that case, the observed line width and\nmean energy both indicate that the reprocessing matter lies with-\nin \u0002100 Schwarzschild radii of the SMBH, while the equiva-\nlent width requires a substantial covering factor.\n10. DISCUSSION\nThe above analysis assumes that the underlying hard power\nlaw and soft excess seen in the low-flux state of 1H 0419\u0001577\nin 2002 September remains constant (or, at least, much less\nstrongly variable) over a timescale of 1\u20133 yr. The similar power-\nlaw index\/compTT parameters and the absence of a soft excess\nin the mid-low\u2013, intermediate-, and high-flux state difference\nspectra support that assumption and in turn suggest that the\ncore and variable X-ray emission components have a separate\norigin.\nFig. 15.\u2014Top: Core soft excess obtained by subtracting the blackbody and\n0.6 keV Gaussian line components from the 0.3\u201310 keV power law plus Laor\n(1991) line fit to the low-state EPIC data.

First, ex-\namination of the difference spectra of the intermediate- and\nmid-low\u2013state EPIC data supports the conclusion in Paper I that\nthe variable emission component has the form of a steep power\nlaw or cool Comptonized thermal spectrum. Second, this var-\niable emission continuum shows the imprint at intermediate-\nflux levels of absorption in low-ionization matter, the effect of\nwhich decreases as the source flux increases. Third, we note that\nthe X-ray luminosity \u2018\u2018lost\u2019\u2019 in the time-averaged absorbed flux\nis of the same order as that in the soft X-ray emission compo-\nnent seen in the low-state spectrum of 1H 0419\u0001577, reported\nin Paper I, suggesting a possible origin of the core soft X-ray\nemission.\nThermal Comptonization remains a likely mechanism for\nthe variable continuum emission component, with an excellent\nmatch to the high-state difference spectrum. We also have ev-\nidence from simultaneous measurements of 1H 0419\u0001577 with\nthe Optical Monitor on XMM-Newton (Mason et al. 2001) that\nthe UV (2120, 2910 8) flux increased by \u000220% from the low-\nto the intermediate-flux state (with smaller increases of \u000210%\nin the U band and\u00055% in V ), consistent with the larger change\nin the UV between the high- and low-flux states (Paper I).\nThese data appear to confirm a link between the X-ray spectral\nchange and enhanced thermal emission from the accretion\ndisk. However, while increased disk emission could drive that\nchange the similarity in the luminosity increase in the soft\nX-ray and UV bands leaves open the alternative possibility that\nthe UV flux increase is due to the reprocessing of soft X-rays\ndirected toward the (unobscured) outer disk. In the latter case,\nthe brightening X-ray continuum would primarily be a conse-\nquence of an increased optical depth of Comptonizing elec-\ntrons. We note in passing that if the scenario we propose for\n1H 0419\u0001577 is widely applicable to radio-quiet AGNs, then\nthe hard (possibly disk-corona emission) and softer continuum\ncomponents must be coupled in some way in order to explain\nthe canonical power-law index (neglecting reflection) of \u0001 \u0002\n1:7 at 2\u201310 keV, observed in broadband fits for Seyfert 1 gal-\naxies in general (Nandra & Pounds 1994), as well as the long-\nterm average spectrum of 1H 0419\u0001577.\nGiven that the peak luminosity of the variable X-ray emis-\nsion component is \u000510% of the bolometric (accretion) lumi-\nnosity of 1H 0419\u0001577, the kinetic energy in a wind could\nbe sufficient to support a separate emission process. Although\nwe have found no unambiguous evidence for an outflow in\n1H 0419\u0001577, the resolved emission-line profiles of Fe K,\nO vii, and O viii imply a large velocity dispersion, while it seems\nlikely that as the cold absorber is photoionized some fraction\nwill be driven away by the strong continuum radiation pres-\nsure. We also note the growing evidence in other recent studies\nfor ionized outflows at velocities of \u00025%\u201320% of c (Chartas\net al. 2002, 2003; Pounds et al. 2003, 2004a; Reeves et al.\n2003). Any such outflow is likely to have an initial velocity\nthat reflects the gravity of its origin (as with stellar winds), so\nthat a wind emerging from a small radius will have a corre-\nspondingly high velocity. The kinetic energy carried by such\na \u2018\u2018black hole wind\u2019\u2019 (King & Pounds 2003) could then sup-\nport a separate emission mechanism of order v\/c times the bo-\nlometric luminosity, with shocks in the outflow (e.g., Camenzind\n& Courvoisier 1983) perhaps providing the enhanced Comp-\ntonizing electrons. A timescale for major spectral change in\n1H 0419\u0001577 being on the order of several months, one possible\ncause of an increased outflow may be the coalignment of mag-\nnetic field lines in the inner disk (Livio et al. 2003). Alternatively,\nif the variable X-ray emission arises from the base of a jet\n(e.g., Markoff et al. 2001) then it is interesting to note that syn-\nchrotron radiation could, qualitatively, also explain the spectral\nform of 1H 0419\u0001577.\nAbsorption features in both the difference and flux-ratio\nspectra of 1H 0419\u0001577 provide clear evidence for substantial\nlow-ionization matter overlying (or embedded in) the X-ray\ncontinuum emission region. The marked decrease in opacity\nand\/or covering factor of the absorber as the X-ray flux in-\ncreases indicates that the absorbing matter lies close to the\nSMBH, a conclusion also consistent with the Seyfert 1 classi-\nfication of 1H 0419\u0001577. The low-ionization parameter then\nrequires the absorbingmatter to be of high density (k1017 cm\u00013)\nto survive the intense continuum irradiation. A possible sce-\nnario is for the absorbing matter to be in small, dense clouds\nthat partially cover the continuum source (e.g., Ferland & Rees\n1988), the covering factor decreasing as the source flux in-\ncreases, a change modeled by a reducing column density in our\nspectral fitting. Dense matter at the base of a jet or outflow\nprovides other potential sites. The recent discussion of \u2018\u2018aborted\njets,\u2019\u2019 where dense blobs of matter are ejected from the inner\naccretion disk at subescape velocities (Ghisellini et al. 2004),\nalso offers a geometry that might be compatible with the results\nwe report here.\nAlthough the spectral variability in 1H 0419\u0001577 is extreme,\nthe low-flux state spectrum is remarkably similar in appear-\nance to the low-state spectra of two other bright Seyfert 1 gal-\naxies, NGC 4051 (Pounds et al. 2004a; Uttley et al. 2004) and\nMCG\u00016-30-15 (e.g., Reynolds et al. 2004). In each case a hard\npower-law continuum also exhibits a broad spectral feature at\n\u00023\u20136 keV that may alternatively be fitted by an extreme rela-\ntivistic Fe K line or by partial covering of the X-ray continuum\nby low-ionization matter. In the disk-corona model of hard X-ray\nemission, where UV photons from the accretion disk are up-\nscattered in an overlying corona (e.g., Haardt &Maraschi 1991),\nan unusually hard spectrum indicates a relatively low UV flux\nand \u2018\u2018photon-starved\u2019\u2019 corona. The intrinsic hardness of the core\nspectrum would be reduced somewhat if continuum reflection is\nenhanced, for example, by light bending in the strong gravity\nnear the black hole, as proposed by Miniutti & Fabian (2004) to\nexplain the extreme Fe K emission line in the low-state spectrum\nof MCG \u00016-30-15. In that case a simultaneous observation by\nBeppoSAX supported the enhanced reflection rather than par-\ntial covering models. However, in the light of the new evidence\nreported here for substantial cold matter close to the black hole\nin 1H 0419\u0001577 it is hard to exclude the possibility that ab-\nsorption also modifies the strength and profile of the key diag-\nnostic Fe K emission line in AGN spectra.\nThe strong forbidden line of O vii is evidence that a sub-\nstantial part of the core soft X-ray emission comes from an\nionized gas of relatively low density, where the emission mea-\nsure then yields a radial extent (Paper I) sufficient to maintain\nthe soft X-ray emission as essentially constant over the 3 yr of\nour XMM-Newton studies of 1H 0419\u0001577. The detection of\nresolved resonance lines of O vii and O viii and a strong RRC\nof O vii in the full RGS spectrum suggests an additional com-\nponent to the soft X-ray emission from higher density, and\nperhaps turbulent, recombining gas closer to the continuum\nsource. The comparable luminosity of the core soft X-ray\nemission with that of the absorbed continuum in the interme-\ndiate (average) flux state then offers a natural explanation of\nthe soft X-ray emission, when an ionized outflow subsequently\nrecombines. The \u2018\u2018true\u2019\u2019 soft excess in Seyfert 1 galaxies, as we\nfind for 1H 0419\u0001577, may then be more akin to the soft X-ray\nXMM-NEWTON OBSERVATION OF 1H 0419\u0001577 705No. 2, 2004\nemission seen in Seyfert 2 galaxies arising from an extended\nregion of ionized gas.\nFinally, we point out that the detection of cold absorbing\nmatter close to the SMBH in a luminous Seyfert 1 galaxy im-\nplies an additional component to the standard model by which\ntype 1 and type 2 AGNs are distinguished in relation to ab-\nsorption in a distant torus (Antonucci 1993).\n11. SUMMARY\n1. A series of XMM-Newton observations of the luminous\nSeyfert 1 galaxy 1H 0419\u0001577 have shown that the large-scale\nspectral variability is primarily due to a steep power law or cool\nComptonized thermal emission component. In seeking an al-\nternative to the disk-corona model for this new emission com-\nponent it is interesting to note that mechanical energy in a wind\ncould be sufficient to support such a process, perhaps via shocks\nin a turbulent or inhomogeneous outflow.\n2. Broad absorption features superposed on the variable\nemission continuum require substantial cold, dense matter ap-\nparently lying close to the central SMBH. As 1H 0419\u0001577\nbrightens from a low- to a high-flux state, the ionization pa-\nrameter of this absorbing matter increases and its column den-\nsity (or covering factor) falls.\n3. An underlying assumption in our analysis is that a hard\ncore spectral component remains essentially unchanged over\nthe 1\u20133 yr period of the observations. We note the similarity of\nthis core X-ray spectrum of 1H 0419\u0001577 to high-quality low-\nstate spectra of other Seyfert 1 galaxies, including NGC 4051\nand MCG \u00016-30-15, which also show a flat power law, rela-\ntivistic Fe K emission line or partial covering, and strong \u2018\u2018soft\nexcess.\u2019\u2019\n4. In the case of 1H 0419\u0001577, we find that the variable\nsoft excess is essentially an artifact of continuum absorption,\nwhile a core soft X-ray emission component has a spectral form\nand luminosity consistent with the re-emission of the absorbed\nX-ray continuum in an extended region of ionized gas.\n5. While the X-ray spectral variability of 1H 0419\u0001577 is\nextreme, its explanation in terms of a variable soft emission\ncomponent, modified by absorption in low-ionization matter\nclose to the SMBH, is unlikely to be unique, suggesting the\nneed for reappraisal of other high-quality AGN X-ray spectra.\n6. Finally, we note that the occurrence of a substantial col-\numn density of cold gas overlying the hard X-ray source in\na luminous AGN has implications both for the diagnostic po-\ntential of the Fe K emission line and the new source population\nrequired to explain the hard (k5 keV) cosmic X-ray background\nspectrum.\nThe results reported here are based on observations obtained\nwith XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments\nand contributions directly funded by ESA member states and\nthe US (NASA).
