Hancock, J. R. Nicholls and K. Mahmood\nSchool of Industrial and Manufacturing Science\nCranfield Institute of Technology,\nCranfield, Bedford, UK\nSYNOPSIS\nThe mechanical properties of chromium rich scales formed on 304 stainless\nsteel have been investigated as a function of deformation rate and operating\ntemperature. At 900\uf0b0C at slow strain rates < 10-6 per second no cracking was\nobserved at strains up to 10%. At rapid strain rates in excess of 10-4 per second\noxide cracking was found to be independent of strain rate and controlled by the\nfracture toughness of the oxide. In the intermediate region, with strain rates\nbetween 10-4 per second and 10-6 in the temperature range 700\uf0b0 to 950\uf0b0C, the\nbehaviour is determined by the creep deformation and fracture mode of the oxide.\nThe mechanism of surface oxide failure is examined and an equation to predict\ncracking density over the full range of both monotonic tensile and creep fracture\nmodes is suggested.\n2INTRODUCTION\nComponents operating at high temperatures, rely on the formation of\nprotective surface oxides to prevent further oxidation in working environment.\nHowever, during operation most components are subject to applied stresses. These\nmay be applied at high rates of strain, for example, in rapidly alternating loading or\nduring rapid thermal cycling. Much lower strain rates would be generated during\nisothermal creep deformation. The alloys used for high temperature service are\ndeveloped to have adequate strength, ductility and creep resistance to withstand\nthese severe operating conditions but the protective surface oxides have more\nlimited resistance to deformation yet to maintain their protective role they must not\ncrack during service.\nFailure by cracking of these surface oxides will lead to loss of protection and\nhence their mode of failure is particularly important. The strain rates that they are\nsubjected to during exposure can vary by several orders of magnitude. At rapid\nrates of loading, the fracture behaviour of the scale would be expected to be\ndetermined by the fracture toughness of the protective scales. Measurements of the\nfracture toughness of the surface scales have previously been measured by two of\nthe authors in the temperatures range 20\uf0b0 to 950\uf0b0C under rapid loading(1). Under\ncreep loading it has been suggested that the effect of the applied creep rate\n3(\uf065) on surface oxide cracking can be described(2-5) by a power law of the form\nwhere d is the average intercrack spacing between through thickness cracks in the\noxide, \uf065 is the applied strain rate and n is a strain rate exponent.\nThe mechanism of surface oxide failure is obviously dependent upon applied\nstrain rate and temperature but how these variables might influence surface fracture\nover wide ranges of strain rate and temperature is considered to be worthy of further\nstudy.\nEXPERIMENTAL\nFor this study it was necessary that the test pieces be manufactured from foil\nto ensure that a substantial fraction of the applied load would be carried by the oxide\nresulting in oxide fracture at some point in the test. 304 stainless steel, an alloy\nforming a predominantly Cr2O3 oxide was selected for compatibility with other oxide\nfracture studies undertaken by the authors(1). The exact nature of the substrate is\nnot critical as the study investigates through thickness crack formation and not\nspallation (interfacial crack formation).\nThe 304 stainless steel used in this study had a composition 18.26 Cr, 8.7 Ni,\n0.3 Si, and 0.06 C was used throughout, in the form of 165\uf06dm thick foil.\nd\n1\n( )n\n\uf061 \uf065 1\n4The specimens were preoxidised in air for 100 hours at 900\uf0b0C to ensure that\nthe oxide thickness and composition was similar on all specimens. The thickness of\nthe oxide was ~1.6\uf06dm and the composition of the oxide approximated to Cr2O3 with\nthe presence of other contaminating sesquioxides such as (Fe Cr)2O3 and\n(FeMn)2O3 through the scale. The test temperatures ranged from 20 to 900\uf0b0C with a\ncomprehensive series of tests made at temperatures of 700\uf0b0C, 800\uf0b0C and 850\uf0b0C\nand 900\uf0b0C. Two types of tests were used, both were conducted in air:-\n(i) Standard tensile tests were made on specimens produced to ASTM standard\nE-345-81. An Instron testing machine was used with five different cross head\nspeeds ranging from 0.25mm per minute to 125mm per minute. As the\nspecimen gauge length was 50mm it was possible to use strain rate of\n8.33x10-5 per second up to 4.17x10-2 per second.\n(ii) Creep tests were performed in a conventional beam loading machine\nmodified to take the same size specimens as used in the tensile tests. Creep\ntests at 700\uf0b0, 800\uf0b0, 850\uf0b0 and 900\uf0b0C were made at loads calculated to give\nstrain rates between 10-5 and 10-8 per second. Extreme care had to be taken\nwith both creep and tensile tests to ensure that no damage was done during\nset up and counterbalancing was used to avoid any inadvertent loading. All\nthe specimens were deformed to 10% strain in order to ensure saturation\ncracking of the surface oxides.\n5After testing the specimens were furnace cooled and then examined by both\noptical and scanning electron microscopy. The crack spacing (d) on each specimen\nwas measured at three different positions to obtain an average value. It is accepted\nthat some growth in the length of cracks may have occurred during cooling,\nhowever, as the specimens were strained sufficient to result in a saturation of the\ncrack density no new crack formation between existing cracks is to be expected.\nA typical example of cracks formed during testing is shown in Figure 1.\nRESULTS OF CRACK MEASUREMENTS\nValues of the average crack spacing (d) were measured on both creep and\ntensile tests.\nAt low strain rates of < 10-6 per second no oxide cracking was observed at\n900\uf0b0C, even after 10% strain. This is in agreement with similar findings by earlier\nworkers(5,6,7) who also found no cracking at high temperatures and low strain rates.\nThis effect has been attributed to the creep rate of the oxide being faster than the\napplied deformation rate imposed by the strain of the underlying metal. This work\nwould support that hypothesis.\nAt creep rates between 10-6 and 10-4 per second cracking did occur and the\nresults are shown in Figure 2. In this region the crack density is shown to depend\nupon both the applied strain rate and the applied temperature.\n6At the higher imposed strain rates which were obtained during tensile testing,\nalso shown in Figure 2, it can be seen that the cracking density is dependent upon\ntemperature but is independent of applied strain rate at strain rates greater than ~10-\n4 per second.\nIt seems reasonable to consider that, at the higher strain rates, the oxide\nfailure will be dominated by fracture toughness considerations. In the creep region,\ncreep deformation and a viscous sliding of oxide segments have been suggested to\nexplain the effects observed(2-5). Both mechanisms appear to be reasonable but\ntheir interdependence is not obvious. To examine the dependence of crack density\non measurable material properties the two areas have been examined in greater\ndetail.\nCracks produced during tensile deformation\nThe values of average crack spacing (d) found during tensile testing at\ndifferent strain rates are shown on the right hand side of Figure 2. The scale used\nshows clearly the independence of strain rate effects but does not identify, in\nsufficient detail, the precise influence of temperature on d. This has been replotted\nin Figure 3 and shows how the crack separation d increases with increasing test\ntemperature.\nIn the region where oxide failure is independent of strain rate it would be\nexpected that oxide fracture would be related to fracture toughness. The critical\n7stress indensity factor Kc has been measured for surface oxides over the\ntemperature range under investigation (20-900\uf0b0C) and the results are reproduced in\nFigure 4(1). By combining the data plotted in Figure 3, with that presented in Figure 4\nat the relevant test temperatures, one may show that to a first approximation d2 is\nproportional to Kc, Figure 5. Hence under rapid loading, such as exists during\nthermal shock or under a transient load cycle fracture of the scale is shown to\ndepend upon the fracture toughness of the surface oxide.\nCracks produced during creep deformation\nAt the lower strain rates which are typically produced under creep loading the\ncrack density is dependent upon both strain rate and temperature. Riedel(2) has\ndeveloped an analysis for oxide fracture which, if considered in uniaxial tension, can\nbe written in the simplified form\nwhere h is the oxide thickness, \uf073c is its critical fracture stress and \uf068 is a viscosity\ncoefficient related to the oxide metal interfacial layer.\nFor an oxide of constant thickness such as used in this investigation, at a\nfixed temperature, the first term becomes a constant and hence the equation can be\nrewritten as:-\nd =\n8h 1\n\u2030\nc\n\u2030\uf073\n\uf068 \uf065\n\uf0e6\n\uf0e8\uf0e7\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f8\uf0f7\n\uf0e6\n\uf0e8\uf0e7\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f8\uf0f7 2\nd =\nA \u2030\n\uf065\n\uf0e6\n\uf0e8\uf0e7\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f8\uf0f7 3\n8where A is a constant for any given temperature and film thickness.\nLater work by Schutze(4,5) on a range of steels and superalloys demonstrated\nthat the exponent was generally less than 0.5 and values of between 0.26 and 0.44,\ndepending upon the alloy under test, were found to give a better fit to his\nexperimental data. However, the exponent value of 0.5 has theoretical significance\nin terms of viscous sliding or creep. Further, if it is intended to consider both fast\nand slow strain rates then equations (2) and (3) both suggest that as the strain rate\nincreases, d should approach zero. But, it was shown in the section on tensile\ntesting, that as the strain rate increases, the value of d assumes a characteristic\nspacing, which is independent of strain rate, controlled by the fracture toughness of\nthe oxide.\nHence it would seem more appropriate to rewrite the Riedel equation as\nwhere C is a measure of the crack spacing produced at high strain rate.\nUsing the tensile data results at strain rates greater than 10-4 per second, it\nhas been shown that d reaches a constant value and that d2 is directly proportional\nto Kc the critical stress intensity factor of the oxide. To check whether this also\napplies to the creep data, the creep data has been replotted as d2 vs 1\/\uf065 in Figure 6.\nThis figure shows that the data does give a reasonable fit to equation (4) and the\nincreasing slopes of the lines with increasing temperature show that A is\n2d =\nA\n+ C\uf065 4\n9temperature dependent as would be expected if some form of viscous flow is a\ncontrolling factor.\nThe intercept on Figure 6 when 1\/\uf065 \uf0ae 0 i.e. \uf065 \uf0ae \uf0a5 means that this d2 should\nbe a limiting value. In the section on tensile deformation this was shown to be\nproportional to Kc the critical stress intensity factor.\nTo explore whether the creep results would predict the same effect, a plot of\nthe intercept on Figure 6 at 1\/\uf065 = 0 should give a value of d2 (at \uf065 \uf0ae \uf0a5) which should\nbe directly proportional to the critical stress intensity factor. Figure 7 plots the\nintercept C against Kc and it is seen to be a very reasonable linear relationship. It\nmust be emphasised that the oxide scale tested was approximately of constant\nthickness, resulting from the 100h preoxidation treatment at 900\uf0b0C. Subsequent\ncreep test at temperatures in the range 700-900\uf0b0C resulted in only a limited further\ngrowth of this oxide. Hence this test procedure is unique in that the fracture\ntoughness (Kc) of the scale can be changed (via test temperature) for a constant\nscale morphology and thickness (determined by the preoxidation treatment used).\nThis enables equation (4) to be reformulated in terms of Kc as:-\nwhere the constant B is temperature independent.\n2\ncd =\nA\n+ B K\uf065 5\n10\nThis equation can now be used to represent all the data generated both in the\ntensile tests and in the creep tests. It shows the dependence of the crack spacing\non the fracture toughness of the oxide and it enables the surface oxide fracture\nunder both rapid loading, as in thermal cycling, and slow strain rate loading, as in\ncreep deformation, to be reconciled. At high strain rates, the first term A\/\uf065 becomes\ninsignificant, fracture behaviour is strain rate independent, and d is determined by\nthe fracture toughness of the oxide. At low strain rates the first term is dominant but,\nas the applied strain rate is increased, there is always a characteristic minimum\ncrack spacing value which is determined by the second term BKc and this agrees\nwith experimental observations.\nCONCLUSIONS\n1. At very low strain rates (smaller than 10-6 per second) and at high\ntemperatures (greater than 800\uf0b0C) there is no evidence of surface oxide\ncracking on 304 stainless steel even at strains as high as 10%. It is\nconcluded that in this region the creep strain in the oxide can accommodate\nthe superimposed deformation rates.\n2. Under high strain rates (greater than 10-4 per second) imposed by rapid\ndeformation or by thermal cycling. Fracture of the protective surface oxide\noccurs and the crack density is independent of strain rate. The crack density\nis however, temperature dependent and is determined by Kc the critical stress\nintensity factor of the surface oxide at the operating temperature.\n11\n3. In the intermediate creep region, crack density depends upon both\ntemperature and strain rate. A simple single equation of the form:-\ncan be used to describe both the creep and high strain rate oxide fracture,\nwhere A and B are constants. A is temperature dependent and B\ntemperature independent. This equation has been shown to give a good\napproximation to the surface oxide cracking behaviour on 304 stainless steel.\nREFERENCES\n1.
