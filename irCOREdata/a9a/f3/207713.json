Hammel\nTracing Very Long-Term Kinship Networks Using SOCSIM\nMike Murphy1\nAbstract\nWhile each individual has 10 billion ancestors a thousand years ago, these are not\ndistinct and the actual number of distinct ancestors is much smaller. A female\n(\u2018Mitochondrial Eve\u2019) and a male ancestor (\u2018Y-chromosome Adam\u2019) of all humans\ncertainly existed, possibly about 100,000 years ago, and a most recent common ancestor\n(\u2018MRCA\u2019) of all humans existed much more recently. I use the SOCSIM micro\nsimulation program to examine the patterns of descent over periods of several centuries\nof an initial population using as indicators: the proportion of these people without any\nliving descendants by the end year of the analysis; the mean value and variability in the\nnumber of their distinct descendants; and the distribution of genetic contribution (ie the\nexpected proportion of the DNA of individuals in the initial population found in the\nlater population). About three-quarters of those born in the past have no descendant,\nmainly because they did not reach the age of reproduction. With the initial population\nsizes used here, about 4,000 people, after about 500 years the number of descendants of\nall of those who have any descendant becomes close to the size of the total number of\ndescendants, confirming that even in this time-scale, a person is either the ancestor of\neveryone, or of no-one. However, the genetic contribution that those in the initial\npopulation make to later generations does not exhibit a similar tendency to uniformity.\nIssues such as the sensitivity of simulation results, which are inevitably based on\nsmaller numbers than real human breeding group sizes, and the need to modify\nconventional measures of generational replacement to cases with multiple lines of\ndescent are also considered.\n                                                       \n1\n London School of Economics (Prepared for Conference \"Future Seniors and their Kin\" Sponsored\nby the U.C. Berkeley Center for the Economics and Demography of Aging, The Marconi Center,\nMarshall, California 5-7 April 2002)\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\n172 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\n1. Introduction\nThe first page of Preston, Heuvaline and Guillot (2001, p1) defines the scope of the\ndiscipline of demography: \u2018Demographers also use the term \u201cpopulation\u201d to refer to a\n\u2026 collectivity that persists through time even though its members are continuously\nchanging through attrition and accession. This collectivity persists even though \u2026 a\nvirtually complete turnover of its members occurs at least once a century.  Demographic\nanalysis focuses on this enduring collectivity\u2019.  However, in practice a very small\nfraction of demographic work is concerned with such long-term population movements,\nand much is concerned with relationships at a single point of time. While there have\nbeen valuable demographic studies of long-term aggregate population trends (eg\nWrigley and Schofield 1981), studies of the dynamics of populations \u2018continuously\nchanging through attrition and accession of individuals\u2019 are very rare, in part because of\nthe lack of information to track patterns of descent over long periods of time. Therefore,\nempirical studies have tended to be undertaken by groups such as genealogists or\ngeneticists usually for the specialised and atypical populations for which relevant\ninformation is available.  The lack of demographic interest is surprising, since so much\ndemographic analysis is concerned with the patterns of numbers of offspring of women\n(including childlessness), but so little with the numbers of offspring in the next\ngeneration of grandchildren, and almost none in patterns among generations further\napart, as databases such as POPLINE confirm. However demography has developed a\nnumber of approaches for the analysis of the dynamics of human populations that may\nbe combined with those of these neighbouring disciplines to elucidate the long-term\ndynamics of population in greater detail than hitherto.  In this paper, I bring together\nsuch approaches within the framework of a demographic microsimulation model,\nSOCSIM, and present some findings about long-term individual-level patterns of\ndescent.  These results may be used to compare and to complement those from the other\nmain disciplines that have been concerned with some aspects of long-term population\ndynamics, including mathematical statistics, where powerful, but highly artificial,\nmodels have been developed for well over a century, and I show how recent results\nfrom stochastic theory are related to those in demographic anthropology (Wachter and\nLaslett 1978).\nThe kinship distribution that exists at a particular point in time is determined by\nlong-term demographic parameters (for example, whether a 70 year-old woman today\nhas a nephew depends on her parents\u2019 pattern of fertility around a century ago). Little\ncontemporary information exists on kinship availability from large nationally\nrepresentative data sources and even less for historical populations, with data confined\nto sources such as historical reconstitution, or genealogies from specialised populations.\nHowever, tracking kin over extended periods of time soon becomes infeasible, and\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 173\nusually requires modelling. A given person today has 2q ancestors q generations ago, so\nthat with an average 30-year generation period, 1000 years ago, the number of ancestors\nis over 10 billion at a time when the global population was under one billion and lack of\ngeographical mobility means that the actual pool of ancestors is much smaller than the\nglobal figure (Table 1). Although each of these 10 billion is a real person, in that a\ndirect line of descent that can be drawn from the descendant to the ancestor, they are\nnot distinct and the same ancestor will appear on many different occasions since there\nwill usually be many links between two ancestors separated by long distances in time.\nTable 1: Number of ancestors (non-distinct)\nGenerations Years Population size\n0 0 1\n1 30 2\n5 150 32\n10 300 1,024\n15 450 32,768\n20 600 1,048,576\n25 750 33,554,432\n30 900 1,073,741,824\n35 1050 34,359,738,368\nNote: this Table also gives the numbers of descendants if each individual has two children who survive to themselves reproduce.\nThe issue of long term population kinship has been addressed analytically: for example,\nKen Wachter (1978) estimated that a given person in contemporary Britain would have\nancestors from about 85% of the people alive at the time of the Norman Conquest,\n1066. This model is based on simplified assumptions (\u2018balls into buckets\u2019) that permit\nelegant closed solutions but they do not attempt to model the demographic process. In\nearlier periods, Francis Galton and H. W. Watson (Galton and Watson 1874) used\nbranching theory to estimate the probability of surnames becoming extinct (although,\ntheir results were incorrect and the correct ones had been derived earlier by I.-J.\nBienaym\u00e9 in 1845, see Wachter and Laslett 1978, p.126). Since surnames are usually\npassed through the male line, this form of transmission is equivalent to a Y\nchromosomal linked trait, and analysis of surnames has been used to estimate the\nmagnitude of inbreeding in human populations (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer 1971;\nJones 1996). Medical genetics is another area where interest in long-term descent\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\n174 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\npatterns arises, including pedigree studies, which have been a principal method for\nidentifying rare recessive diseases in particular (Dawkins 1992; Jones 1992, 1996). A\nrecent DNA-based study suggested that a descendant of a 9,000 year old skeleton\n(\u2018Cheddar man\u2019) found in England was living in same location (Sykes 2001).\nIn any population, the number of mothers of daughters is less than the number of\nfemales in the next generation (Note 1). Therefore the further back one goes, the\nnumbers decrease until there is only one such female, often called \u2018Mitochondrial Eve\u2019,\nbecause mitochondrial DNA (which is in organelles outside the cell nucleus, and is\nessentially transmitted only through the mother\u2019s egg) is therefore inherited through the\nmaternal line (Ayala 1995; Cann, Stoneking and Wilson 1987; Vigilant et al 1991).\nCorrespondingly, since the Y-chromosome is passed only through the father, a directly\nanalogous argument shows the existence of \u2018Y-chromosome Adam\u2019. The dates of these\nancestors are typically set at around 100,000 years age (P\u00e4\u00e4bo 1995; Dorit, Akashi and\nGilbert 1995), with Y-chromosome Adam being assumed to be rather more recent than\nMitochondrial Eve since there is greater variability in male than in female reproductive\nperformance. There is, of course, no suggestion that these formed a couple, and they\nalmost certainly did not.\nRecently analytic studies have investigated the issue of common ancestry from a\ntwo-sex perspective (Chang, 1999), that goes beyond the earlier single sex of descent\nmodels. A more sophisticated concept is that of \u2018Most recent common ancestor\u2019\n(MRCA) (Chang, 1999), which refers to descent through any line, and figures of the\norder of 1,000 to 3,000 years ago for this common ancestor have been suggested,\nalthough this is probably an underestimate because it is based on the assumption of a\nrandomly mating, non-overlapping generations, homogeneous population, which does\nnot distinguish two sexes. He shows that the number of generations back to this MRCA\nfor a population of size n is only log2(n), giving a value of 32.5 generations (or 975\nyears ago) for a global population of size 6 billion.  Chang (1999, p 1005) notes that \u2018an\napplication to the world population of humans would be an obvious misuse\u2019 of the\nmodel.\nThere has been some confusion in reconciling figures such as the very high\nnumbers of ancestors resulting from genealogical studies, and the single ancestors, such\nas Mitochondrial Eve, that arise from genetic studies. The key point is that\nMitochondrial Eve is the female who provided mitochondrial DNA to subsequent\ngenerations, and not necessarily any other genetic contribution. There were many other\nfemales who provided other parts of the genome, and indeed, there are some ancestors\nwho provided no genetic material to their descendants. Mitochondrial Eve is the most\nrecent common female ancestor through the wholly female line (the same argument\nhold for Y-chromosome Adam through the wholly male line). Even if a person had 10\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 175\nbillion distinct ancestors a millennium ago, only one of those born around that time\nwould be in a direct female line.\nThe range of numbers of ancestors at earlier times quoted above represent the\nmaximum and minimum indicators of long-term patterns of descent. These studies are\noften based on theoretical and simplified models and they do not, for example, take\naccount of actual patterns of human reproduction, including population heterogeneity,\nand they do not show the evolution of such kinship linkages in real human populations.\nTherefore, in this paper, I have undertaken some preliminary work in constructing\ncounts of the number of ancestors and descendants of a population over long periods of\ntime (at least in comparison with most demographic studies) with a demographic\nregime broadly that of Britain using the SOCSIM micro simulation program in order to\nassess the possibilities of such approaches, which as Chang (1999) notes, will be\nnecessary to provide realistic models to complement theoretical ones.\n2. Data and methods\nDemographic micro simulation is the principal method used to elucidate kinship\npatterns in historical, contemporary and future populations (Smith 1987; Wachter 1987;\nWolf 1994; Zhao 1996; Van Imhoff and Post 1998). This analysis uses the SOCSIM\ndemographic micro simulation model, originally developed by Gene Hammel and Ken\nWachter at Berkeley with Peter Laslett at Cambridge University (Hammel, Wachter and\nLaslett 1978; Hammel, Mason and Wachter 1990), in which an initial population is\nsubject to appropriate rates of fertility, mortality and nuptiality (including divorce). In\nrecent decades, cohabitation has become increasingly important and it is also included\nin the model (Murphy, 2001).\nThe SOCSIM model is closed (Watcher 1987) so that partners have to be found\nwithin the existing simulation population. Every member of the simulation population\nhas a link to each of his or her partners, parents, youngest child, and next oldest sib\nthrough both the mother and father (if the relevant individual has ever existed). A\nclosed model is more complex than open models in which a partner is created when\nrequired, but as they do not come with any demographic background, it is impossible to\ninvestigate general kinship and other relationships since only one partner in a couple\nwill usually have such information. With a closed model, a full set of kinship links is\nconstructed over time as the individuals marry and procreate, so that any kinship\nrelationship through blood or marriage may be traced through living and\/or dead kin.\nSOCSIM has a number of additional features that make it attractive for analysing\nkinship distributions. First, it is the most comprehensive of such models, allowing\nvariable demographic rates to be input. The model, written in the C language, is\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\n176 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\ncomputationally efficient and freely available so that the code can be amended or\nextended by users, in this case to generate the specific types of links between\nindividuals.\n3. The populations used\nThe model starts with an initial population that evolves under the given rates of fertility,\nmortality and nuptiality. The initial populations are of sizes of 4,000 and 10,000, with\nthe age structure of England in 1741 taken from Wrigley and Schofield (1981). Two\nsimulation periods of 600 years were chosen: 1250 to 1850, and 1750 to 2350. The first\ndemographic regime was that of a pre-industrial (and pre-transitional) society using\ndemographic rates provided by the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and\nSocial Structure. These pre-transitional rates, which refer to the period around 1700 to\n1750, are assumed to hold over the whole period 1250 to 1850, since the values for\nearlier periods were not very different and they provide a realistic set of rates with a\nlong-term growth rate close to zero. These baseline values, shown in Table 2, lead to a\npopulation with a small but positive rate of growth (\u2018unconstrained\u2019 values) and I also\nuse a second set with fertility values slightly adjusted to make the long-term population\ngrowth rate close to zero (\u2018constrained\u2019 values).\nThe second simulation period uses the same initial pre-transitional population but\nwith transitional and post-transitional regimes from 1750 to 2350. Appropriate rates for\nEngland and Wales were used in the period 1750 to 2000, and broadly similar rates for\nthe 1990s were continued to 2350, see Table 2. Full kinship links could not be\nconstructed if out-of-partnership births were allowed, because such births would not\nhave an identified father. Therefore I add the assumption that all births take place\nwithin a cohabiting or married union.\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 177\nTable 2:  Summary of demographic parameters used\nPeriod TFR (per 1,000) e0 (males) Age at first marriage (males)\n1300-1400 3,554 40.7 29.5\n1400-1500 3,446 40.1 29.6\n1500-1600 3,612 40.4 28.8\n1600-1700 3,582 40.4 29.5\n1700-1800 3,754 40.7 29.2\n1800-1900 3,170 41.6 29.1\n1900-2000 2,096 63.6 28.1\n2000-2100 2,122 76.4 32.4\n2100-2200 2,139 76.5 32.5\n2200-2300 1,996 76.4 33.0\nNote: constrained values for period 1300-1800.\nBeyond 2000, the TFR is assumed to be rather higher than at present in Britain and\nmost industrialised countries, but current rates would lead to a population too small for\nuseful analysis by 2350. Mortality is expected to continue to improve and the average\nage at marriage to increase.\nThe partnership algorithm is based on a \u2018marriage market\u2019 that those adults who\nare not currently married join in order to seek a partner from the pool of eligibles of the\nopposite sex.  People enter the pool of eligibles according to the appropriate population\nage, sex and marital-status specific marriage rates.  Partners are found by a scoring\nalgorithm that has a preferred spousal age difference of about two years and with\npreferences being tapered, so that all partnerships are confined to cases in which the\nman is no less than five years younger or no more than ten years older than his partner.\nThe model includes a prohibition on incest between siblings and parents and children. It\nis possible to specify alternative algorithms (eg Murphy 2003), which could include\nsystems that promote marriage among kin, such as in traditional Japanese and some\nSouth Asian societies, or discourage it, such as the prohibition of marriage of those\nrelated up to the seventh degree by the Catholic Church in the eleventh century.\nThis partnership algorithm has been found to produce realistic patterns of spousal age\ndifferences, and to clear the marriage market with the sorts of population sizes used\nhere. From 1960, cohabitation is included in the model: in this case, such couples have\nthe option to convert their cohabiting partnership into marriage.\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\n178 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\n4. Analytic, empirical and operational questions\nThe first question is the feasibility of undertaking meaningful long-term simulations,\ngiven the very large number of relationships that build up as shown in Table 1. It was\nfound necessary to develop an alternative kinship network structure to enable the\nmultiple lines of descent to be analysed satisfactorily (discussed in the Appendix), and\npopulation sizes of up to 10,000 people and time periods of about 600 years are\npossible, although a single simulation can take some hours to run.  While this limits the\nnumber of issues that can be addressed simultaneously, nevertheless some of alternative\nsimulations were undertaken to assess the sensitivity of the results to different\nconditions. Different initial population sizes were chosen to assess the sensitivity of\ndifferent breeding populations (demes, or isolate size). Real populations are not closed,\nalthough establishing the effective breeding size of human populations is problematic,\nand no obvious estimates were found for this analysis. However, Cavalli-Sforza and\nBodmer (1971, p 482) quote a figure of 278 for the upper Parma Valley, in a relatively\nisolated area for this important, but admittedly somewhat arbitrary parameter. Urban\npopulations have larger effective breeding group sizes, and therefore initial population\nsizes of 4,000 and 10,000 were chosen for these experiments. The distribution of\ndescendants might also be expected to be sensitive to the rate of population growth, so\nalternative models were constructed with a slow rate of growth of 0.2% per annum\n(doubling time of about 350 years), and one in which the fertility rates were constrained\nto make the rate of growth close to zero.\nFor the 1250 start date, 5 models were run with initial population size of N:\nN=4,000 for 600 years (constrained)\nN=4,000 for 600 years (unconstrained)\nN=4,000 for 300 years (unconstrained)\nN=10,000 for 300 years (unconstrained)\nN=10,000 for 300 years (constrained)\nThese alternatives were chosen to assess the sensitivity of the outcomes to the initial\npopulation size, the time interval, and to the demographic rates used. (For the 10,000\ninitial size population, I use a 300-year horizon because of machine constraints.)\nThe SOCSIM model builds up kinship links for an initial population of unrelated\nand never-married people (most long-term genetic studies also start with the assumption\nof a group of unrelated people, Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer 1971). After about 50 years,\nthe simulated population has realistic age and sex structures, and complete marital and\nfertility histories, so that the group of ancestors used in this analysis from the 1250\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 179\ninitial population are those born in years 1300-15 (the \u2018original population\u2019) and the\nmain group of descendants analysed are those born 500 years later, in years 1800-15.\nFor the 1750 initial population, the corresponding original and descendant populations\nare those born in 1800-15 and 2300-15 respectively. A 15-year window provides\nsufficient numbers to make generalisations, but does not contain any parent-child\ncombinations, since the minimum age at childbearing is over 15 years.\nFor each person in the original population, I determine the number of descendants\n- if any - in the target population. The degree of relatedness between an ancestor and a\ndescendant is the sum of (0.5)q for all distinguishable lines of descent that connect\nthem, where q is the number of generations separating them in a given lineage. The\ndegree of relatedness gives the genetic contribution of the ancestor to his or her\ndescendants\u2019 genomes. The degree of relatedness plays a central role in the analysis of\nmechanisms of kin selection (Hamilton 1964a,b), and it may also be analogous to any\nform of inheritance that is divided between children independently of the number of\nchildren. If the population contains no inbreeding, then there is only one line of descent,\nbut as noted above, this is clearly not the case and a main interest is in the distribution\nof degree of relatedness after many generations.\nThere are a number of indices of overlap of relationships in genetic studies, such\nas inbreeding coefficients, kinship coefficients, consanguinity and co-relatedness. The\nfirst is used widely but refers to an individual, the probability that he or she has\ninherited the same gene at a particular locus from a single ancestor (\u2018identical by\ndescent\u2019, or ibd), whereas I am concerned with more general patterns of flows between\ngenerations, and so I use degree of relatedness as the main indicator. Consideration of\nalternative indicators and of patterns of degrees of relatedness among living people will\nbe deferred.\nIn analytic studies, the length of generation is usually taken as fixed and, if so,\ngenerations are non-overlapping and there is a simple correspondence between\ngenerations and time period, so that useful measures such as NRR and fitness may be\ncalculated straightforwardly over long periods of time. However, with two individuals\nin direct descent born many decades apart, there will usually be no single unique\nnumber of generations separating them. There are likely to be many, perhaps thousands,\nof lines of descent between them (as quantified later), so that they are separated by a\ndistribution of number of generations. Since the maximum age of childbearing for\nwomen is about three times the minimum age (and the difference is even greater for\nmen), in theory, there could be three-fold difference in the number of generations that\nseparate two individuals born some centuries apart.\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\n180 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\n5. Results of the analysis\n5.1. Probability of no descendant\nAbout three-quarters of those born in 1300-15 have no descendant born in the period\n1800-15 (Table 3, models 1 and 2). This figure is only slightly smaller for the growing\nthan for the stationary population over the period, showing that the probability of\nhaving no descendant is relatively insensitive to population growth. More noteworthy is\nthe fact that the proportion of those with no descendant at 500 years is identical to the\nfigure found for that population after 250 years (models 1 and 3; note that in this case,\nthe values are based on the same population analysed at two points of time). Thus if\nthere is any descendant born about 250 years later, it is very likely that there will be\ndescendants born a further 250 years ahead. The reason for this is that a given\nindividual is likely to have a large number of descendants after a period of 250 years: an\naverage of just over two children surviving to adulthood is necessary to keep population\nnumbers constant and Table 1 shows that the average number of such descendants will\nbe about 250 (not necessarily all distinct, but it is likely that there will be a large\nnumber of distinct descendants \u2013 the Table shows the numbers of children if two\nsurvive to reproduce themselves). Thus there are a large number of chances of having at\nleast one descendant 500 years later if there are descendants after 250 years, since not\ndo so would mean that every one of these descendants after 250 years would have to\nhave no descendants, which become increasingly unlikely as the number of descendants\nincreases.  The chance of someone having no descendant after 500 years who had had\n250 descendants 250 years later, each of whom had independent probabilities of about\n0.75 of no descendant 250 years later is 10-31. Thus complete extinction essentially\ntakes place in the first few generations, with the failure to reach the age of reproduction\nbeing the main determinant.\nTable 3:  Probability of no descendant born in future periods\nModel Population born Years\nahead\nInitial population size &\ntype\nProbability Size of\noriginal\npopulation\nNumber with\ndescendants\nin original\npopulation\nSize of\ndescendant\npopulation\n1 1300-15 500 N=4,000 unconstrained 71.7 1,911 540 4,781\n2 1300-15 500 N=4,000 constrained 75.9 1,837 443 1,814\n3 1300-15 250 N=4,000 unconstrained 71.7 1,911 540 2,909\n4 1300-15 250 N=10,000 unconstrained 72.8 5,035 1,369 8,195\n5 1300-15 250 N=10,000 constrained 76.4 4,501 1,061 4,613\n6 1800-15 500 N=4,000 unconstrained 73.6 1,977 522 1,104\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 181\nThe difference in the probability of having no descendant after 250 years with the\nsame demographic regime, but with different initial population sizes is very small and\nprobably due to stochastic variability (models 3 and 4, or 2 and 5), suggesting that the\nresults are insensitive to initial population size, which is not surprising since this is\ndetermined mainly by events in the early years of the simulation run, but emphasising\nthat results can be generalised to larger populations and do not depend on a particular\nchoice of initial population size. The probability of having a descendant in the more\nrecent 500-year period is broadly similar (model 6), but this is because the initial\ndemographic regime of the nineteenth century was superior to the pre-transitional one,\nrather than to the very different patterns of later periods.\n5.2. Number of distinct descendants\nThe mean number of distinct descendants of those born in the period 1300-15 with at\nleast one ancestor 250 years later with the constrained model was 270 (the value\naveraged over for all those in the original population was about one quarter of this) with\nthis closed breeding group of total size 4,000, rather similar to the number if there was\nno inbreeding with the simple assumption of Table 1. However, more noteworthy is the\nfact that the number increases by only a factor of about seven over the next 250 years\nwith a fixed population size, as the multiple lines of descent between individuals build\nup (Table 4). After 500 years, this average number is close to the total population size\nof the descendant population (and the descendant population size provides a ceiling).\nThe average number of descendants is, of course, larger in a growing population\n(models 2 and 3), but rather similar in the two time periods (models 1 and 4). The key\nfactors that determine the numbers of distinct descendants are (i) whether there is any\ndescendant; (ii) the population growth rate; and (iii) the population breeding size.\nTable 4:  Mean number of descendants\nModel Population born Years ahead Initial population size & type Mean of those with at least one descendant\n1 1300-15 250 N=4,000 unconstrained 430\n2 1300-15 500 N=4,000 unconstrained 4,709\n3 1300-15 500 N=4,000 constrained 1,768\n4 1800-15 500 N=4,000 unconstrained 1,088\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\n182 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\nAn individual with, say, six surviving children would be expected to have six\ntimes as many grandchildren as an individual with one child, and in an infinite size\nbreeding population, this differential would be expected to remain in the future. In order\nto show how the variability in number of descendants changes over longer periods,\nFigures 1(a) and 1(b) show the distribution of number of descendants at 250 and 500\nyears for those born 1300-15 who had at least one descendant. The variance in number\nof descendants is fairly broad at 250 years, but by 500 years, the distribution has\nbecome sharply concentrated around a single value, and it appears that it will tend to\nconcentrate further in later periods to a single value. While the collapse of variability in\nnumber of descendants may at first appear unexpected, the reason is that after some\ncenturies, any individual in the later period is likely to have as ancestors a high fraction\nof all of those in the original population who have any descendants. Once any two\nindividuals in the original population are linked in this way through any line of descent,\nthen any descendant of anyone in this line will also be a descendant of the member of\nthe original population. Since the population becomes increasingly interlinked, the\npopulation moves to the position of all members having the same number of distinct\ndescendants.  This also means that the use of a 15-year window does not lead to any\nproblems in estimating the number of descendants, since although it is possible that a\nparticular line of descent might not include a birth in that window (the parent could be\nborn in 1795 and the first child in 1820, for example), but given the large number of\ndescendants, the chance of one birth not occurring in such a 15-year window is\nvanishingly small.\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 183\nFigure 1(a):  Estimated number of descendants: 1300-15 cohort after 250 years\nFigure 1(b):  Estimated number of descendants: 1300-15 cohort after 500 years\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\n184 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\nThese results are consistent with Chang\u2019s (1999) theoretical model, which leads to\nthe conclusion that before about 700 AD, every human is either an ancestor of everyone\nalive today, or has no live descendants. However, in contrast, to Chang\u2019s model that\nabout 80 per cent of people in the earlier period are the ancestors of everyone alive\ntoday, the figure here is about 25 per cent of births, largely because of mortality before\nreaching the age of reproduction (Note 2).\n5.3. The concept of generations and long-term replacement\nAlmost all demographic analysis, descriptive and theoretical, is based on the concepts\nof time period and\/or cohorts, and the relationship between these approaches remains a\nmajor interest of the discipline and such issues are relevant to neighbouring disciplines\nsuch as population genetics. As Shryock, Siegel and Stockwell (1976, p326) note: \u2018In\ntaking up generation reproduction rates, we are passing to measures of reproduction that\nare based on the fertility and mortality experience of an actual cohort of women during\nits reproductive years\u2019, but key concepts such as intergenerational replacement, usually\nof mothers by their daughters, do not translate straightforwardly to the relationship\nspanning more than one generation. Even extensions to the relationship between\nfertility of grandparents and grandchildren are rare as noted in the first paragraph of this\npaper (Murphy and Wang 2001; Mueller 2001), although there are relatively few\nproblems, since the assumption that each person has four distinct grandparents is\nreasonable, given the low estimates of incest (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer 1971).\nHowever, the concept of a well-defined number of generations between two given\nindividuals is not meaningful for long-range analysis since the great majority of\ndescendants will have a given ancestor through different numbers of generations, and\nthe network formed is not a conventional genealogical one since a given individual can\nappear at different places in the genealogy, see the Appendix for a discussion. Table 5\nshows that the mean number of links per person in these populations is between 1 and 2\nthousand, and that the number of generations between an individual in the original and\nan individual in the descendant populations has a range of 12 to 20 for the 500-year\nperiods.  The average length of a generation is shorter in the earlier period, reflecting\nthat later age at onset of childbearing assumed in the later period, but variability is less\nin the later period. However, in both cases, the two largest numbers of generations\ncontain about three-quarters of all values.\nVirtually all lines of descent will contain members of both sexes, and therefore to\nconcentrate solely on female values of average length of generation seems\ninappropriate.  In addition, while the concept of generational replacement seems useful\nwhen one looks at a single generation it ceases to be meaningful for large numbers on\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 185\ngenerations between two people, and comparison between time periods would appear to\nbe the most appropriate ways of analysing change, even though the limitations of period\ndata are well-recognised.  If a concept of generational length is to be retained, then it\nwill be necessary to consider such variability in the same way that standard analysis has\nto do so.    For example, variability in the age at childbearing leads to modifications in\nthe equations of population dynamics as compared with the case of a fixed age.  For\nexample, the value of the intrinsic rate of growth r is approximated by the second order\nsolution to Lotka\u2019s equation (Keyfitz, 1968)\n2r2\u03c32 - r\u00b5 + ln(R0)= 0\nwhere R0 is the NRR, and \u00b5 is the mean and \u03c32 the variance of the childbearing\ndistribution.  If the age at childbearing was fixed (ie  \u03c32  = 0), then r = ln(R0)\/\u00b5, but if it\nis not fixed (ie  \u03c32 >0), then the annual population growth will be higher, although the\nNRR and mean age are the same in both cases.\nTable 5:  Distribution of number of lines of descent between original and descent\npopulations\nOriginal population\nNumber of generations 1300-15 constrained 1800-15\n12 8 0\n13 511 0\n14 8,715 112\n15 70,113 4,087\n16 260,741 44,187\n17 334,155 165,709\n18 103,228 264,920\n19 5,571 85,052\n20 32 3,755\nTotal 783,074 567,822\nAverage no. lines 1,768 1,088\nAverage length of\ngeneration\n30.1 28.3\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\n186 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\n5.4. Degree of relatedness\nAn alternative way of analysing long-term kinship links is by the genetic contribution\nthat the earlier generation makes to the later one. The degree of  relatedness for a given\nline of descent between two people is (0.5)q, where q is the number of generations\nbetween the ancestor and descendant.  Since many people will have a given ancestor\nthrough more than one line - in cases such as that of Table 5, many thousands - I sum\nthese components (when cousins marry, no matter how widely separated, their offspring\nwill have at least one ancestor in common, and the overall degree of relatedness is the\nfraction of genes identical by descent that the two individuals have in common).\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of the sum of degrees of relatedness in the\ndescendant population for each member of the original population who has a\ndescendant for the period 250 and 500 years ahead (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)) (Note 3). In\ncontrast to the results of Figure 1, this distribution does not show a tendency to collapse\nto a single value and, if anything, the variability tends to increase over time. The reason\nfor this is that although the number of distinct descendants depends only on there being\nat least one line of direct descent, the degree of relatedness depends also on the number\nof links and the number of intervening generations. Thus even without any mechanism\nthat favours one group, disparities remain effectively constant over time, when\nmeasured, for example, by the coefficient of variation.\nFigure 2 (a): Sum of degree of relatedness: 1300-15 cohort after 250 years\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 187\nFigure 2(b): Sum of degree of relatedness: 1300-15 cohort after 500 years\nThus each individual in the original population who has any descendants, is likely to\nhave many descendants in the long term, but to have different degrees of relatedness\nwith these descendants. The magnitude of this variability is shown in Figure 3, which\nplots the quartiles of the distribution of degrees of relatedness to those born in 1800-15\nfor each of the 540 members of 1300-15 population who have any descendant in 1800-\n15. In order to show the results more clearly, these 540 observations have been sorted\nby their median degree of relatedness with the people in the 1800-15 population (see\nTable 3). In general, the interquartile range is relatively constant, at about 40% of the\nmedian value, and considerably less than the variability among the original population,\nafter excluding those without any descendant.\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\n188 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\nFigure 3: Distribution of degree of relatedness: 1300-15 cohort after 500 years\n6. Summary and Conclusions\nIn this preliminary analysis, I have shown that the SOCSIM kinship microsimulation\nmodel can elucidate long-term demographic processes for which data are not available,\nand that some of the results although at first appearing counter-factual are consistent\nwith other studies. These methods could be extended in a number of ways to include\npopulation mixing, additional patterns of heterogeneity and assortative mating to\nprovide more realistic models. Since the full kinship network is available for analysis, it\nis possible to compute indices relating to the descendant population, such as degree of\ninbreeding, therefore providing a flexible and realistic model for investigating a range\nof issues related to patterns of inheritance.  In order to do so, it was necessary to\nconstruct an alternative linked network to the conventional genealogical one, in order to\nmake such analyses feasible with current technology.\nIt is often assumed that the effective size of the breeding population is very large,\nand theoretical models assume that mixing takes place wholly at random, but the\nlimited information available from historical populations suggests that the actual\nnumber was often much smaller, and that populations of the sizes used here are\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 189\nreasonable, but in addition, it is shown that the results are usually relatively insensitive\nto the chosen population size.\nWhile there has been considerable interest in macro-level demographic evolution\n(eg Wrigley and Schofield 1981), with exceptions such as Hajnal (1964, 1982) and\nWachter (1978), demographers have had little interest in long-term micro-demographic\nprocesses, and they have often attempted to seek explanations for differences in\ncontemporary patterns by appeal to longstanding differences in social organisation such\nas the role of Protestantism, or of Mediterranean family structures (Lesthaeghe 1995;\nReher 1998).  However, I would emphasise the similarities in background of large-scale\nconnected areas such as Europe, in that the pool of ancestors are the same group of\npeople in what would often be regarded as relatively recent time scales \u2013 this point is\nnot inconsistent with the assumption of relatively small isolated groups at particular\ntime periods.  While it is possible to observe long-term historical continuities, whether\nin Cheddar man, the distribution of ABO blood groups and more detailed genetic\nmarkers, and in language (Cavalli-Sforza, Menozzi and Piazza 1994), what we are\nobserving is the differential distribution of the same genetic pool interacting with, and\ncovarying with, the physical and cultural environment to produce the differences we\nfind today.\nThe time-scale involved is important: after 250 years, there is not much indication\nof the population structure moving towards a dichotomy: everyone being in one of two\ngroups, having  the same number of descendants, or none at all, but after about 500\nyears, the original population is seen to have become bifurcated into these two groups.\nThis is a considerably longer time scale than found in most demographic applications:\nfor example, the time for a population to become essentially stable with fixed fertility\nand mortality is of the order of a century. The scope of micro simulation models such as\nSOCSIM to contribute to understanding of  such process, in conjunction with other\napproaches, would appear to be strong.\n7.

In theory, the numbers could be equal, but this would not feasible in the long term,\nsince for the population to avoid extinction, the average number of daughters per\nwoman surviving through to the reproductive age must be at least one, and the\nactual number born per mother be greater than one to allow for infertility in the\nfirst generation and mortality up to the reproductive years in the second generation.\nTherefore every woman alive today can trace her ancestry through the female line\nto a single woman. The mitochondrial DNA of every woman comes from this\nsingle woman (although mutations may have occurred in the intervening period).\n2.  The 80% figure is actually 1 minus the extinction probability for a branching\nprocess with offspring distribution Poisson(2). It is in fact, the asymptotic solution\nof Wachter\u2019s (1978, p 157) equation for the proportion of those alive at the Norman\nConquest with descendants alive today (estimated by Wachter as 85%). The\nasymptotic solution for the proportion of the population with descendants if the\npopulation size is fixed is approximately 0.7968, and it is given by the solution of\nthe equation m=1-exp(-2m), which may be easily estimated iteratively using\nWachter\u2019s formula.\n3.  Figure 2 shows the sum of the degrees of relatedness across all members of the\ndescendant population for each member of the original population who has a\ndescendant (those without a descendant contribute nothing, of course). Therefore it\ngives the total genetic contribution of each individual member of original\npopulation to the gene pool of the descendant population. The m people in the\noriginal population who have a descendant in the descendant population are\nnumbered i=1,2, ...,m. The n people in the descendant population are numbered\nj=1,2...,n. The degree of relatedness of person i and person j is r(i,j), so Figure 2\nshows the values R(i)=\u03a3r(i,j) summed over j=1,2...,n.\n        If the descendant population contained only ibd genes from the original\npopulation, the sum of values shown in the panels of Figure 2 would be equal to the\ndescendant population size, but this is not so because those born just before 1300\nand just after 1315, but who have no-one in direct descent born in the period 1300-\n15 may also contribute. Conversely, some of those born in the period 1300-15 will\ncontribute to the genes of those alive in 1815, but who were not born in the window\nof 1800-15. Figure 3 shows the median and interquartile values of values of r(i,j)\nfor each value i across the j values j=1,2...,n. In the original population, the values\nhave been ranked according to the median value in order to show the variation\nbetween members of the original population more clearly.\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 191\nReferences\nAyala, F.J. 1995.

The youngest child (node) is\nlinked to ego and it is checked if the node has any children. The node is then linked to\nthe next oldest sib (confined to natural children of the parent only), and if there is any\nsuch sib, this person becomes the new node and is checked for any children, before\nmoving on to the next oldest sib, until all sibs are identified. When all kin of this\ngeneration one have been checked, the new node is the youngest child of the oldest sib\nwho is linked to the oldest sib. If there is no member of generation two, the procedure\nterminates. The procedure is repeated generation by generation until all descendants are\nidentified.\nEach member of the network is identified by the depth in generations from ego,\nand both the number of distinct descendants and their degree of relatedness to ego are\ncalculated and these values are cumulated across all lines of descent (since a descendant\nthrough more than one line will have a genetic contribution from the ego in question\nthrough each lineage).\nThe overlap will depend on the size of the breeding group. In our simulations, we\nhave chosen a starting population of 4,000 people for most cases. There is no difference\nin principle in tracking people forwards or backwards in time, since the final result is\nthat the two individuals in the original and descendant populations will either not be\nfound to be in direct descent, or they are, possibly through a number of different lines.\nThe relationship between a person in the descendant and original populations is\nsymmetric. In calculating the number of distinct ancestors, a broadly similar procedure\nis adopted, although somewhat easier to visualise since each person as exactly two\nparents. For each ego (eg those born in period 1800-15), the mother and father are\nidentified (all egos have both biological parents identified, unless they are part of the\noriginal founder population); they can be traced back generation by generation by\nproducing a linked list at each generation that is then linked. This is shown in the\nAppendix Figure.\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 195\nAppendix Figure\nDemographic Research \u2013 Volume 10, Article 7\n196 http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\n"}
