INTRODUCTION\nReinforced concrete deep beams, generally defined as beams\nhaving shear span-to-overall depth ratio not exceeding 2.0, are\ncommon structural members having useful applications as load\ndistribution elements such as transfer girders, pile caps and\nfoundation walls in tall buildings. They are classified as\ndiscontinuity regions (D-regions) having a non-linear strain\ndistribution over the cross-section depth owing to a smaller\nshear span-to-overall depth ratio (< 2.0) and extraordinarily\nhigh concentric loads.1 As a result, shear deformations are not\nnegligible. In addition, the coexistence of high shear and high\nmoment within interior shear spans of continuous deep beams\nleads to a significant reduction of effective strength of concrete\nstruts directly carrying the applied loads to supports.2\u20134 The\nconventional elastic solution or shear hypotheses developed for\nslender beams would therefore be inadequate for the evaluation\nof the structural behaviour of deep beams.\nSeveral investigations on predicting shear strength of deep\nbeams can be classified as empirical formulae based on test\nresults of simply supported deep beams,5\u20139 strut-and-tie\nmodels,1,10\u201313 mechanism analysis14,15 using upper-bound\ntheorem of plasticity theory and non-linear finite element\nanalyses.16,17 Ashour2 and Rogowsky et al.3 showed that\nempirical formulae, such as ACI 318-999 (unchanged since ACI\n318-83) and Construction Industry Research and Information\nAssociation (CIRIA) Guide 2,8 failed to evaluate the shear\ntransfer capacities of horizontal web reinforcement and\nconcrete struts of continuous deep beams tested. The strut-and-\ntie model is a powerful analytical tool, which can easily\nrepresent the load-transfer mechanism of deep beams, but it is\ndifficult to determine the real dimension of concrete struts and\nshear transfer mechanism of vertical and horizontal web\nreinforcement as pointed out by Marti.18 Mechanism analysis\ncan provide logical shear transfer mechanism of vertical and\nhorizontal web reinforcement, but shear transfer capacity of\nconcrete is varied according to the effectiveness factor of\nconcrete, which depends on the material characteristics and\ngeometrical dimensions of concrete members.18,19 Non-linear\nfinite element analyses, which are usually carried out as a\ncomplementary tool to verify experimental work, give detailed\nsolutions. According to Wang et al.15 and Ashin,16 however,\nthey require a lot of time, input parameters and calibration to\nbe useful in practical design.\nArtificial neural network (NN) techniques can be employed as a\nuseful tool to precisely predict structural performance of\nconcrete members if many reliable test results are provided as\nshown by several researches.20\u201322 Goh20 and Sanad and Saka21\nshowed that shear strength of deep beams can be better\npredicted by multi-layered feed-forward NNs than other\nexisting formulae. It should, however, be noted that NNs are\nhardly capable of giving extrapolation for parameters outside\nthe network training set as they can learn and generalise\nthrough only previous patterns.23,24 It is therefore important to\nprovide NNs with more test data to find acceptable solutions to\ndifferent situations.\nIn the present study, multi-layered feed-forward NNs trained\nwith the back-propagation algorithm are developed to model\nthe non-linear relationship between shear strength of deep\nbeams and different influencing parameters. An extensive\ndatabase of simple and continuous deep beams tested by\ndifferent researchers is used to train, generalise and verify the\ndeveloped NN. Statistical distributions of predictions obtained\nfrom the trained NN are compared with those determined from\nstrut-and-tie models proposed by ACI 318-05,1 Siao10 and Tan\nand Cheng.12 Also, a parametric study is carried out to ensure\nwhether training and validation subsets in the developed NN\nwere suitably built.\n2. NEURAL NETWORK MODELLING\n2.1. Network architecture for back-propagation\nA typical multi-layered feed-forward NN without input delay\ncommonly consists of input layer, one or more hidden layers\nand output layer as shown in Fig. 1, where p indicates the\ninput vector, iw and lw give the weight matrices for input and\nhidden layers, respectively, b represents the bias vector and n\nis the net input passed to the transfer function f to obtain the\nneuron\u2019s output vector y. Input data of input layer given from\noutside feed into hidden layers connecting input and output\nlayers in a forward direction, and then useful characteristics of\ninput data are extracted and remembered in hidden layers to\npredict the output. Finally NN predictions are produced\nthrough the output layer. Each processing element would have\nmany inputs, but it can send out only one output.\nAmong the available techniques to train a network, back-\npropagation is generally known to be the most powerful and\nwidely used for NN applications.21,22 To obtain some desired\noutputs, weights, which represent connection strength between\nneurons, and biases are adjusted using a number of training\ninputs and the corresponding target values. The network error,\ndifference between calculated and expected target patterns in a\nmulti-layered feed-forward network, is then back propagated\nfrom the output layer to the input layer to update the network\nweights and biases. The adjusting process of neuron weights\nand biases is carried out until the network error arrives at a\nspecific level of accuracy.\n2.2. Generalisation\nOne of the problems that occur during NN training is the so-\ncalled overfitting23 as the network has memorised the training\nfeatures, but it has not learned to generalise new patterns.\nAccording to Shi,25 training data evenly distributed over the\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n( )iw1,1 1,1 \u03a3\np1\np2\np8\np9\n( )iw1,1 18,9\n\u03a3\n\u03a3\n\u03a3\n\u03a3\nn1,1\nn1,2\nb1,1\nb1,2\nn1,17\nn1,18\nb1,17\nb1,18\ny1,1\ny1,2\ny1,17\ny1,18\n( )lw2,1 1,1\nn2,1\n( )lw2,1 1,18\nb2,1\ny2,1 \u0001 T\np p\np p\np p\np p\np\n1 w 2\n3 c 4\n5 b 6 t\n7 v 8 h\n9\nn\n; ;\n; \/  ;\n; ;\n; ;\nnumber of span\n(simple or continuous);\n\u0001 \u0001\n\u0001 \u0002 \u0001\n\u0001 \u0001\n\u0001 \u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nb h\nf a h\nT V\n\u03c6 \u03c6\n\u03c6 \u03c6\nFig. 1.

One of the most effective methods to improve\ngeneralisation of NNs is early stopping.23,25 In this technique,\nthe available data are divided into three subsets: training,\nvalidation and test subsets. The training set is used for\ncomputing the gradient and updating the network weights and\nbiases to diminish the training error. When the error on the\nvalidation set, which is monitored during the training process,\nincreases for a specified number of iterations, the training is\nstopped, and then the network weights and biases at the\nminimum validation error are returned. The test set error is\nnot used during the training, but it is used for verification of\nthe NNs.\n2.3. Experimental database\nA total of 362 simple and 71 continuous deep beam specimens\nfailed in shear compiled from different sources in the literature\nis used to train and generalise the developed NNs. In the\ndatabase, 74 simple4,26 and 44 continuous2,4,27 deep beams\nwere tested by the authors and the others compiled from\npublished literatures: de Paiva and Siess,5 Ramakrishna and\nAnanthanarayana,6 Kani,28 Kong et al.,29 Manuel et al.,30\nSmith and Vantsiotis,31 Furuuchi et al.,32 Hayashikawa et al.,33\nWalraven and Lehwalter,34 Sato et al.,35 Tan et al.,36\u201340 Lee\nand Kim,41 and Oh and Shin42 for simple deep beams, and\nRogowsky et al.3 and Asin16 for continuous deep beams. Some\ntest specimens had no web reinforcement, whereas others were\nreinforced with vertical and horizontal web reinforcement: the\nnumber of simple and continuous deep beams in the database\nis 81 and 15, respectively, for beams without web\nreinforcement, 104 and 26, respectively, for beams with only\nvertical web reinforcement, 45 and 15, respectively, for beams\nwith only horizontal web reinforcement, and 132 and 15,\nrespectively, for beams with orthogonal web reinforcement.\nPrestressing enhances the shear capacity of deep beams.43 Test\nresults on prestressed concrete beams are, however, scarce;\nprestressed concrete deep beams are therefore not included in\nthe database. The database ascertained that the shear strength\nof deep beams was influenced by geometrical conditions such\nas section width, bw, and depth, h, longitudinal top,\nr9s \u00bc A9s=bwd, and bottom, rs \u00bc As=bwd reinforcement ratios,\nvertical, rv \u00bc Av=bwsv, and horizontal rh \u00bc Ah=bwsh web\nreinforcement ratios, and shear span-to-overall depth ratio,\na=h, and material properties such as concrete compressive\nstrength, f 9c, and yield strength, fy, of reinforcing bars, where\nA9s and As are area of longitudinal top and bottom\nreinforcement, respectively, d is effective section depth, Av and\nsv area and spacing of vertical web reinforcement, respectively,\nAh and sh are area and spacing of horizontal web\nreinforcement, respectively and a is shear span for continuous\ndeep beams, as shown in Fig. 2\nThe main variables above were rearranged in the database to\nimprove efficiency of NN training. As the influence of the\namount and yield strength of longitudinal and web reinforcing\nbars on the shear strength of deep beams depends on concrete\nstrength,10 longitudinal top \u0003t \u00bc r9s f 9y= f 9c and bottom\n\u0003b \u00bc rs fy= f 9c reinforcement indices, and vertical\n\u0003v \u00bc rv fyv= f 9c and horizontal \u0003h \u00bc rh fyh= f 9c web\nreinforcement indices were used as inputs in NNs, together\nwith bw, h, f 9c, a=h, and supporting system as shown in Table\n1, where f 9y, fy, fyv and fyh represent yield strength of\nlongitudinal top and bottom reinforcement and vertical and\nhorizontal web reinforcement, respectively. The number of\nspans of deep beams (i.e. simple or continuous deep beam) was\nalso represented in the input layer by a neuron having a\nnumerical value of either 1 or 2 for simple and two-span deep\nbeams, respectively. Shear strength, Vn, at failed shear span,\nwas the only output of the NNs developed.\nIn the database, the shear span-to-overall depth ratio of simple\nand continuous deep beams ranged from 0.25 to 2.0 and from\n0.5 to 2.0, respectively, the overall section depth is between\n300 and 1750 mm for simple deep beams and between 400 and\n1000 mm for continuous deep beams, and longitudinal bottom\nreinforcement index ranged between 0.04 and 0.53 for simple\ndeep beams and between 0.05 and 0.19 for continuous deep\nbeams. The test specimens in the database were made of\nconcrete having a low compressive strength of 18.0 MPa and\n25.0 MPa for simple and continuous deep beams, respectively,\nand a high compressive strength of 89.4 MPa and 68.2 MPa for\nsimple and continuous deep beams, respectively. Test\nspecimens having smaller concrete strength, width and depth\nthan the lower limits stated above were excluded from the\ndatabase used in the current investigation for practicality\npurposes.\nIt is recommended when using back-propagation algorithm in\nMATLAB version 6.044 that the data set is divided into three\nsets\u2014training, validation and testing sets\u2014to overcome the\noverfitting problem as explained above. The training data set\ncomprises half of all data entries, and the remaining data\nentries are equally divided between the validation and testing\nsets. Little research has been conducted on the training data\nselection for NNs using back propagation. Jenkins45,46\nsuccessfully used the hypercube concept for selecting training\npatterns of four design parameters for reinforced concrete deep\nbeams. It is not, however, possible to adopt this technique in\nthe current analysis as the database was collected from\ndifferent sources where intervals between discrete values are\nnot uniform and may constitute clusters. In addition, as the\nnumber of design variables considered is nine, it would require\na very high number of training data; even if only the cube\ncorners are selected. The technique below is therefore followed\nto partition the database for training, validation and testing\npurposes. The test specimens in the database were arranged in\nPP\naaaa\nLL\nsh\ns v\nRExt.RInt.RExt.\nh\nA\u0002s\nbw\nAs\nAh\nAv\nFig. 2.

In every four specimens, the first and\nthe third deep beams were then chosen for training subset, and\nthe second and fourth specimens were selected for validation\nand test subsets, respectively. The distribution of each\nparameter across its range in the training subset is manually\nexamined to ensure that it covers the range of input\nparameters. If the range of input in the training subset fails to\ncover the entire distribution of the database, the rows in the\ndatabase were rearranged until input of training subset could\ncover the entire distribution of the database range as shown in\nTable 1 and Fig. 3.\n2.4. Building of neural network\nThe NN toolbox available in MATLAB Version 6.044 was used\nfor building of the current NN model. Ashour and Alqedra22\nshowed that NN algorithms in MATLAB Version 6.0 can be\nconveniently implemented and used to model large-scale\nproblems. In a multi-layered NN having a back-propagation\nalgorithm, the combination of non-linear and linear transform\nfunctions can be trained to approximate any function\narbitrarily well.44 In the present NNs, tan-sigmoid transform\nfunction was employed in the hidden layers as it is generally\nknown to be more suitable for multi-layer networks developed\nfor non-linear applications than log-sig function that generates\noutputs between 0 and 1,44 and linear transform function was\nadopted in the output layer. As upper and lower bounds of the\ntan-sigmoid function output are +1 and \u00011, respectively, input\nand target in database were normalised using equation (1)\nbelow so that they fall in the interval [\u00011, 1]. NNs can also\nhave better efficiency with the normalisation of original\ndata23,24\n(pi)n \u00bc 2(pi \u0001 (p)min)(p)max \u0001 (p)min\n\u0001 11\nwhere (pi)n and pi are normalised and original values of data\nset, and (p)min and (p)max represent minimum and maximum\nvalues of the parameter under normalisation, respectively.\nAlso, after training and simulation, outputs having the same\nunits as the original database can be obtained by rearranging\nequation (1) as follows\npi \u00bc [(pi)n \u00fe 1][(p)max \u0001 (p)min]\n2\n\u00fe (p)min2\nOverfittings in training and outputs of NNs are commonly\ninfluenced by the number of hidden layers and neurons in each\nhidden layer. A trial and error approach was therefore carried\nout to choose an adequate number of hidden layers and\nnumber of neurons in each hidden layer as given in Table 2. In\naddition, NN performance is significantly dependent on initial\nconditions23 such as initial weights and biases, back-\npropagation algorithms, and learning rate.

Distribution of different parameters in database and training subset\nStructures & Buildings 161 Issue SB1 Neural network modelling of RC deep beam shear strength Yang et al. 33\ncalculated from 30 different trials, as different random initial\nweights and biases are employed in each trial. Although the\nmean and standard deviation of the ratio of predicted and\nmeasured shear capacities of deep beams presented in Table 2\nby different NN architectures were similar, the 9 3 18 3 1\nnetwork is the most successful, achieving the closest\npredictions (the mean of the ratio between the prediction to\nexperimental shear strengths is 1.01) and the least standard\ndeviation of 0.193. In addition, overfitting seldom occurred in\nthe 9 3 18 3 1 network. The 9 3 18 3 1 neural network shown\nin Fig. 1 with initial weights and biases therefore achieved the\nhighest coefficient of determination of all 30 trials was finally\nselected for predicting shear strength of deep beams.\n3. COMPARISONS WITH STRUT-AND-TIE MODELS\nSeveral researchers10,12 showed that strut-and-tie models can\nbe effectively used to predict shear strength of reinforced\nconcrete deep beams. ACI 318-051 and Eurocode 213 also\nrecommend the use of strut-and-tie models for designing deep\nbeams. Fig. 4 shows schematic strut-and-tie models of simple\nand continuous deep beams based on ACI 318-05 and Tan and\nCheng.12 Also, formulae suggested by ACI 318-05,1 Siao,10 and\nTan and Cheng12 to predict shear strength of deep beams using\nstrut-and-tie models are summarised in Table 3. These\nformulae showed that shear strength predicted by strut-and-tie\nmodels is greatly dependent on the width and inclination of\ncompressive struts, the effective strength of concrete and\namount of web reinforcement. No shear transfer mechanism of\nweb reinforcement was specified in ACI 318-05, whereas shear\ntransfer capacity of web reinforcement in the models by Siao\nand Tan and Cheng models is influenced by the inclination of\nstruts. In addition, effectiveness factor of concrete in\nACI 318-05 is 0.6 or 0.75, depending on the amount of web\nreinforcement and independent of concrete strength and shear\nspan-to-overall depth ratio, whereas no effectiveness factor is\nused in the other two models as shear transfer capacity of\nconcrete in Siao\u2019s model was determined from regression\nanalysis of test results and Tan and Cheng\u2019s model used the\nmodified Mohr\u2013Coulomb failure criterion at the bottom nodal\nzone. Among the three models, size effect was only considered\nin Tan and Cheng\u2019s model, represented by the factor \u0142 as given\nin Table 3.\nTable 4 gives the mean and standard deviation of the ratio\nbetween predicted and measured shear capacities,\n\u00aacs \u00bc (Vn)Pre:=(Vn)Exp:, of simple and continuous deep beams\nwith different web reinforcement arrangement. Also, the\ndistributions of \u00aacs for all specimens in the database against\nshear span-to-overall depth ratio are shown in Fig. 5; Fig. 5(a)\nfor strut-and-tie model of ACI 318-05, Fig. 5(b) for Siao\u2019s\nformula, Fig. 5(c) for Tan and Cheng\u2019s model and Fig. 5(d) for\n9 3 18 3 1 NN. For ACI 318-05\u2019s model, a better mean and\nstandard deviation is shown in beams without or with\northogonal web reinforcement than those with only vertical or\nhorizontal web reinforcement as given in Table 4. The largest\nstandard deviation of all four models is demonstrated by Siao\u2019s\nformula. Predictions obtained from Tan and Cheng\u2019s model\noverestimate the shear strength of continuous deep beams with\nonly horizontal web reinforcement; namely, the mean \u00aacs for\ncontinuous deep beams with only horizontal web\nreinforcement is 1.121. For all three strut-and-tie models,\npredictions become highly unconservative with the increase of\nshear span-to-overall depth ratio and higher \u00aacs,m and \u00aacs,s are\nobserved in continuous deep beams than in simple deep beams\nas shown in Table 4 and Fig. 5. On the other hand, predictions\nobtained from the 9 3 18 3 1 NN are in better agreement with\ntest results regardless of shear span-to-overall depth ratio and\nconfiguration of web reinforcement, even in continuous deep\nbeams; \u00aacs,m and \u00aacs,s are 1.028 and 0.154, respectively, for\nsimple deep beams, and 1.0 and 0.122, respectively, for\ncontinuous deep beams.\n4. PARAMETRIC STUDY\nThe developed 9 3 18 3 1 NN was utilised to examine the\neffect of different influencing parameters on shear strength of\nsimple deep beams, namely, the effect of longitudinal bottom\nreinforcement, size effect, relative effectiveness of vertical and\nhorizontal web reinforcement, and shear span-to-overall depth\nratio on the shear strength of deep beams. The trend of\ncontinuous deep beam shear strength predicted by the\ndeveloped NN for different parameters was not as smooth as\nthat for simply supported deep beams as the test results in the\ndatabase for continuous deep beams were relatively small; it is\ntherefore not presented here. The trends predicted from this\nparametric study can also ensure that training and validation\nsubsets in the developed NN were suitably built.\n4.1. Effect of longitudinal reinforcement ratio\nThe influence of longitudinal bottom reinforcement index,\n\u0003b \u00bc (rs fy= f 9c), on the normalised shear strength,\n\u00ban \u00bc Vn=(bwh\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\nf 9c\np\n), of simple deep beams without web\nreinforcement for three different shear span-to-overall depth\nratios is shown in Fig. 6. The normalised shear strength\nobtained from the NN increases with the increase of \u0003b up to a\ncertain limit beyond which \u00ban remains constant. This limit of\n\u0003b decreases with the decrease of shear span-to-overall depth\nratio. This trend was experimentally observed by Tan et al.,40\nand analytically proved by Ashour.14\n4.2. Relative effectiveness of vertical and horizontal web\nreinforcement\nFigure 7 shows the variation of \u00ban of simple deep beams with\nonly vertical or horizontal web reinforcement against shear\nspan-to-overall depth ratio. Vertical, \u0003v, and horizontal, \u0003h,\nweb reinforcement indices are changed from 0.0 to 0.09 with\ninterval of 0.03. Shear strength \u00ban of deep beams decreases\nwith the increase of shear span-to-overall depth ratio a=h up\nto a certain limit (a=h\u00bc1.5), beyond which the variation of \u00ban\nNetwork structures* Mean\n(\u00aacs,m)\nStandard\ndeviation\n(\u00aacs,s)\nCoefficient of\ndetermination\n(R2)\n9 3 93 1 1.020 0.210 0.910\n9 3 183 1 1.010 0.193 0.937\n9 3 273 1 1.019 0.205 0.925\n9 3 183 9 3 1 1.030 0.220 0.904\n9 3 183 9 3 9 3 1 1.023 0.210 0.904\n*The first and the last numbers indicate the numbers of\nneurons in input and output layers, respectively, and the\nothers refer to the number of neurons in hidden layers.\nTable 2. Comparison of outputs and targets according to\ndifferent network structures\n34 Structures & Buildings 161 Issue SB1 Neural network modelling of RC deep beam shear strength Yang et al.\nwould be negligible as observed by other experimental\ninvestigations.31,36 Also, the influence of vertical web\nreinforcement on the shear strength of deep beams is\ndependent on the shear span-to-overall depth ratio as pointed\nout by several researchers.3,4,36 The larger the shear span-to-\noverall depth ratio, the higher the influence of \u0003v on the shear\nstrength of deep beams; namely, when shear span-to-overall\ndepth ratio is more than 0.75, shear strength of deep beams\nincreases with the increase of \u0003v, but that of deep beams\nhaving a smaller shear span-to-overall depth ratio is nearly\nindependent of \u0003v. On the other hand, the influence of \u0003h on\nthe shear strength enhancement of deep beams is independent\nof shear span-to-overall depth ratio. It is also observed that the\ncritical shear span-to-overall depth ratio, where both vertical\nand horizontal web reinforcements are equally effective, is\naround 0.65, indicating that a higher shear strength exhibited\nby beams with only horizontal web reinforcement than beams\nwith only vertical web reinforcement when shear span-to-\noverall depth ratio is less than this critical threshold.\n4.3. Effect of overall depth of deep beams\nThe influence of section overall depth, h, on the \u00ban is presented\nin Fig. 8. It is clearly observed that the normalised shear\nstrength of simple deep beams decreases with the increase of h,\nbut no meaningful size effect appears in deep beams having h\nabove 1000 mm. The decreasing rate of \u00ban against the increase\nof h is more notable in beams having a smaller shear span-to-\noverall depth ratio a=h as the transverse tensile strain in\nconcrete struts increases with the decrease of a=h. It is also\npointed out by Tan and Cheng12 that the smaller a=h, the\nhigher the size effect as it is greatly influenced by strut action\ncarrying very high compressive forces as predicted by the\ntrained NN in Fig. 8.\n( )ws E\nFE\nFE\nTB\ns\nw\nw\n\u0002 t\n\u03b8r\n\u03b8s\nTB\nhjd\nw\nt\n( )V E\n( )lp E\nc\n( )lp E\n( )V E\n( )lp P\nP\nCompressive strut\nC\na\n( )lp P\nP\nd w\n\u03b8w\na\nw\n\u0002 t\n( )ws E ( )ws I\nTB\nc\u0002\nFI\ns\nw\n\u03b8r\nw\nt\nhjd\n\u03b8s\nc\n( )lp E\n( )V E\n( )lp I\n( )V I( )V I\nTB\n( )lp E\n( )V E\na\n(1\u00b70- )( )\u0003 lp p\nFE\nStrut-and-tie\naction in\nsagging zone\na\n\u0003( )lp p\nP\nd wStrut-and-tie\naction in\nhogging zone\nFI\nTT\n\u03b8w\na\nP\n( )lp P\na\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 4.
