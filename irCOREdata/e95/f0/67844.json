ISBN 0-312-23150-4.\nGeorge Orwell once wrote' Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the future\ncontrols the past'. His apt observation about totalitarian regimes is recalled when reading\nthe present book under review. It is a story about the conversion of former Communist elites\n{nomenklatura) into Polish capitalists. In this context, the book focuses on the role of the\nsecret services in Poland, providing an unsettling account about the manner in which they\nhave maintained control since 1981 through infiltration and surveillance, indicating that the\nnetwork of crime to have emerged during this time is intricate as it is premeditated and, of\ncourse, assisted in the ability of key actors to take advantage of opportunities, as we shall\nsee shortly. The book has an important place in the discussion among, inter alia, international\nlawyers as concerns international criminal justice issues, namely by raising serious questions\nas to the manner in which newly established democratic regimes should address the wrong-\ndoings and atrocities of their predecessors. It also contributes to the discourse about crime\ncontrol over transnational financial transactions.\nIn recent years much literature has focused on the development of crime and criminal\nnetworks in the age of globalization and supranational regional transformations. This phe-\nnomenon has taken on an added meaning after the collapse of Communism. The European\nUnion (EU) has recognized this and has tried to address the problem of protecting the single\nmarket urgently, with somewhat mixed results, as the EU is unable to cope with this problem\nwithin its own confines. EU measures, a series of action plans and directives, all aimed at\ncombating organised crime and corruption, attempt to control the westward flow of 'newly\nliberated organized crime' from Central and Eastern Europe that is viewed as providing new\nand significant opportunities for transnational criminal actors.1 Although the book under\nreview does not tackle this problem as such, the transformations to occur under globalization\nand supranational regional organs form an important part of the authors' thesis, who try to\ndefine the nature of the capitalist system in post-Communist Poland and the role of the secret\nservices in its conversion. The result is a provocative analysis of covert actions that were\noccurring during the 1980s. The authors' work is a significant step in filling the lacuna in\nthis area of research.\nMaria Los and Andrzej Zybertowicz's work is based on primary sources in the form of\ninterviews and an impressive selection of secondary materials. Concerning methodology,\nLos and Zybertowicz were not able to rely on any previous academic research. In examining\nthe existing literature, the authors adopt a 'straight intelligence' approach. In other words,\nthey gathered data from diverse sources, ranging from, inter alia, official governmental\n144 BOOK REVIEWS NILR 2002\ndocuments, interviews, leaked and declassified documents, and journalists' reports. This is\ncombined with earlier research carried about by the authors and interviews with well-\ninformed, mostly anonymous sources. The period covered begins in 1980 and ends in 1998.\nThe authors readily admit to having difficulty in fitting their research within a framework\nof non-existent social science concepts. Their aim, however, is not to put forward one binding\ntheory, but to lend some understanding of the complex process at hand.\nThe authors depart from a simple question: if the systematic change in Poland is found\nin the processes of democratization, privatization, and marketization, how have these\nprocesses been affected by, and how have they affected, the party\/police-state framework\nin which they have occurred? The authors recognize that the transformation process requires\nthe reassessment of theoretical frameworks of analysis and, in providing a framework for\nthe party\/police-state, they adopt a heterogeneous approach by exploring the most significant\nmetaphors in the field: revolution, two-step revolution, transition, (systematic) transformation,\npath dependency, multiple transformation, negotiated revolution, and conspiracy (pp. 10-14).\nWhile some have identified this approach as a possible criticism and evidence of tension,2\nthe present reviewer sees this as lending some authenticity to the complex task that the authors\nhave undertaken. The authors discuss the main aspects of each metaphor in chapter 2 to see\nhow adequately they describe Polish developments. Owing to space considerations, a detailed\nexplanation of each theory is impossible, however, it will suffice to look at them briefly.\nTo start, the collapse of Communism in Poland is difficult to define as a 'revolution', as\nthis would imply a forceful overthrow a the regime and a clear break with the past. As the\nauthors succintly point out, the developments in Poland were characterized by caution and\ncareful management, both stressing the need for continuity, not only of the state organs and\ntheir structures and personnel, but also of the legal system. Two-step revolution refers to Max\nWeber's notion of the revolutionary process, which is valid in that it recognizes that there\nis a gap between the interests that resulted in the fall of the old regime and those of the new\none that it promotes. This applies to the Polish case but is not altogether convincing as it fails\nto take a broader view of the role of all actors involved. Path dependency, a concept\nemphasizing the role of the past in shaping the process of change, is an invaluable argument,\nin particular when noting that the new form of social integration is conditioned by mental\npatterns, habits, strategies, and alliances formed under the previous regime.3 Multiple trans-\nformation, a concept that Los has been writing about for some time, refers to a broader context\nwhen examining post-Communist transformations together with other major transformation\nprocess, such as supranational regional transformations or global transformations.4 Negotiated\nrevolution or 'refolution', attributed to Timothy Garton Ash, appropriately suits the book's\npurposes.5 This notion stresses the active role and dynamic survival of various elements of\nthe old system, as well as their reconstruction in the new institutional framework.\nThe authors inevitably treat conspiracy theory, which undoubtedly is a delicate area,\nhaving been subject both to ridicule and political exploitation. The authors are right in not\nrejecting the conspiracy theory outright, and rather to explore some of the suppositions of\nclandestine scheming behind the events that are studied. In doing so, the authors adopt a\nNILR2002 BOOK REVIEWS 145\ncertain general vision of the changes in Poland, without presupposing any answers but instead\naffecting the types of questions asked.\nThe fact that the leadership in Poland during the 1980s was a highly centralized, military\nrule, is an important theme in the book. In chapter 3, the authors begin the journey of taking\nthe reader through the anatomy of the police state. Concerning the echelon of power, many\nformer high-ranking figures in the nomenklatura have survived politically until present day,\ndespite their so-called activity and dedication in the former system. Catherine Epstein, in her\nessay on biographies, wrote that a biography is similar to atext, in that it can be read in many\ndifferent ways, thus manipulated and revised.6 The 20th century has seen a particularly\nwidespread (re)interpretation of past biography for political purposes (p. 2) and Poland is\ncertainly no exception.\nIn this respect, the issue of biographies is an interesting theme in the Polish context, and\nin other post-Communist countries. Perhaps more unknown is the fate of former secret service\nagents after the collapse of Communism. In chapter 8, Los and Zybertowicz detail how many\nformer secret service personnel and militia officers set up private detective and security\ncompanies further to a 1988 Act on Economic Activity. The private security industry\nexpanded in the 1990s, with some 7177 registered private protection and detective agencies;\nit is estimated that many are operating illegally (p. 159). Based on available data, it is\nestimated that between 47,000 and 250,000 is the size of the workforce, a large portion of\nwhich are former and post-Communist secret service operatives, police and military\npersonnel, anti-terrorist experts, correctional service officials, and from related professions\n(ibid.). Most of the security companies have been involved in debt collection and conflict\nresolution as a means to assist the lower courts, which suffer from poor resources. This also\nmeans at times the line between criminal and protection practices has been blurred. The\nescalation of activity prompted the Supreme Control Chamber (NIK) to embark on an eight-\nmonth investigation of the private security industry in 1996, exposing many unlawful\npractices. The industry was not regulated at the time and the 1997 Law that was passed,\nfurther to NIK's findings, has proven inadequate. This is not the most alarming aspect,\nhowever, as many of the top companies have been linked to the most serious financial\nscandals in Polish history. Case Study 3 (there are five in total) provides an overview of the\nFOZZ (Foreign Debt Servicing) scandal which remains unresolved until today. Indeed the\nreverberations can be felt present day, as evidenced in the holding of the third Falzmann-\nSymposium, in 2001, ten years after this NIK inspector in charge of handling the FOZZ affair\ndied under mysterious circumstances.\nIn sum, the shift towards democracy released into society a formidable number of\nspecialists in the area, as they were no longer needed, owing to reductions made by state\nofficials. This phenomenon is not new, as seen in respect to other professions, such as natural\nscientists, who fled West in an effort to offer their knowledge to governments that welcomed\nthem. The authors convincingly argue that as regards secret service operatives, they have\nsucceeded in maintaining access to various resources of the previous careers and remain\nconnected, through personal links, to all levels of power in the post-Communist state. These\n146 BOOK REVIEWS NILR 2002\ndevelopments have served as a catalyst in privatizing violence and crime practiced by these\nnetworks working for companies that serve as fronts for well-developed criminal schemes\nand are aimed to exploit and protect major illegal economic ventures. The authors provide\nvarious references and sources for their claims.\nThe path dependency concept noted above is a legitimate argument to make. To reiterate,\nit argues that Polish society has been conditioned by its police-state past of control through\nsecret surveillance. Studies of totalitarian bureaucracies, such as those operating under Com-\nmunism, point out that the bureaucracy is subservient and works directly for the ruling elite.7\nThis kind of bureaucracy is characterized by socio-political conditions that do not offer the\nindividual the feeling of protection, but rather he or she is perceived as a threat; it also creates\ninformal devices that surrounds individuals and forces them to conform to the expectations\nof the system. Interestingly, NIK has released a paper entitled 'Threat of corruption in the\nlight of audit studies carried out by the Supreme Chamber of Control (the NIK) of the\nRepublic of Poland'.8 It is worth drawing attention to two points in this March 2000 report.\nFirst, NIK identifies the irregularities of police operations as serious, and an issue that\nrequires immediate attention, as it contributes to the weakening of the state and the law.\nSecond, the NIK report mentions several corruption mechanisms, namely excessive compe-\ntence in the civil servant's hands, excessive freedom in decision-making, ignoring documenta-\ntion and reporting, weakness in internal control, unequal access to information, lack of\naccountability, and failure to take specific anti-corruption measures. These observations\nindicate a continuity of the most damaging aspects of the totalitarian state.\nAnd the role of law? The implications as regards setting up a rule-of-law state (Art. 2\nPolish Constitution) are immense. Recalling Podgorecki, of the three branches of government,\nthe judiciary becomes the most visible victim under totalitarianism.9 The Polish judiciary\ncontinues to struggle in its new role in the democratic state. From the technical end, it is\nunderstaffed, underpaid, and is lacking resources. But establishing its independence is all\nthe more difficult when this is compounded by often-repeated slogans that the courts are\nunder-funded, corrupt, and should not decide in matters better left outside the courts. Indeed,\none of the most controversial issues in establishing a rule-of-law state concerns the manner\nin which to address the wrongdoings and atrocities committed by the former regime, a\nquestion which should be dealt with by the courts. Poland is not alone in not knowing how\nto deal with this question. In fact, when the newly-formed Solidarity-led government assumed\npower in 1989, it cautioned against calls for vengeance but did promise to seek justice in\ncrimes committed by the former regime. To date, the vast majority of crimes have gone\nunpunished. Chapter 9 provides a good overview of the lustration and de-communization\nmeasures that have been undertaken in Poland. It is interesting to note that Polish public\nopinion has been inconsistent at best as regards the need for de-communization measures,\nwith 42 per cent surveyed in 1990 supporting such an initiative on the part of the government,\nto 52 per cent rejecting such a move only a year later.1\"\nAdam Strzembosz, the highly respected former Supreme Court justice, who supported\nthe view in 1989 that the judiciary will 'cleanse itself of tainted judges (it should be noted\nNILR2002 BOOK REVIEWS 147\nthat no formal verification was carried out of the judiciary) soon found that this was not to\nbe the case. Concerning lustration, he aptly noted in 1994 that '[technical difficulties appear\ninsurmountable [only] when there is no political will [to prosecute]' (p. 187). This way, it\nbecomes clear that the courts have no way in establishing themselves without the means to\ndo so and perhaps it is the way that is more convenient for some. Cases concerning crimes\nthat took place between 1944-1956 have been heard in courts found in smaller towns or cities,\nwhere there is little publicity and even less local interest.\" International lawyers that refer\nto the success of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission must recognize\nthat political will is a key factor in not only disclosing and clarifying former crimes, but also\nas identified by the authors 'the mechanisms of ruling that made them possible' (p. 197). For\nthose concerned about setting up a rule-of-law state, the book identifies some issues that are\nnot readily taken as obstacle to this purpose, namely the role of hidden actors which influence\npolitical initiatives.\nConcerning criticisms, one weakness of the book is that there are no means of corrobo-\nrating the authors' conclusions. Yet, it is known that there was a systematic destruction of\narchival materials, a fact the respected Polish historian Andrzej Paczkowski has written about,\nnamely the materials from the archives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in 1990.12 However,\none need only to examine the authors' analysis in relation to developments in neighbouring\ncountries, such as Russia, where many of the key political position holders are in fact former\nKGB officers.\nOne of the most interesting parts of the book is the final chapter (10), where the forces\nof globalization are addressed. The entire Polish transition is scrutinized in the context of\nglobal processes. The authors demonstrate how the foundations of the global economy shifted\nthe need for knowledge-based jobs away from the working class, thus allowing the Polish\nnomenklatura to fill these positions and place themselves in positions of power. More\nimportantly, their agenda was legitimatized when it became linked to the notion of Polish\nindependence, thus giving the former Communist elite the chance to separate itself from the\npast and shield itself behind the cover of statehood and democratic slogans. The skills that\nthey could offer fit well into the post-modern global economy, where boundaries are\nambiguous and actors hard to identify. '3 Some of these former secret service operatives have\ngone on to participate in an essential part of the global economy, namely international\ncriminal organizations.\nIn conclusion, Los and Zybertowicz have succeeded in producing a groundbreaking book\non an unknown and possibly shunned subject. The book should appeal to criminal justice\nscholars and assist them in understanding many issues which are related to historical justice,\nas well as financial crimes. Hopefully this book will serve as a catalyst in the discussion about\n148 BOOK REVIEWS NILR 2002\nthe role of secret services and control methods over society in, but not limited to, post-\nCommunist states.\nDr Agata Fijalkowski\nEuropa-Fellow\nEuropa-Universitat Viadrina\nGermany\n1.
