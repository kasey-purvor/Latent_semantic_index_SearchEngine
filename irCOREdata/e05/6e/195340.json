Introduction\n[2] The morphology of the auroral and subauroral\nionosphere is strongly dependent on the interplanetary\nmagnetic field and the level of geomagnetic activity. For\nexample, as the geomagnetic activity increases, the size\nof the polar cap tends to increase and the auroral oval\nmoves equatorwards. This change in the morphology\nimpacts on the characteristics (e.g., Doppler and delay\nspreads, and direction of arrival) of signals received after\npropagation through these regions of the ionosphere. In\norder to develop a better understanding of these effects,\na number of experiments have recently been undertaken\nby the University of Leicester in which the time of\nflight, Doppler frequency, and direction of arrival of HF\nsignals have been measured over several northerly paths.\nMeasurements from Uppsala, Sweden to Leicester, U.K.\nand Kirkenes, Norway to Kiruna, Sweden are considered\nin this paper.\n[3] This paper is primarily concerned with the effect of\ngeomagnetic activity on the channel scattering functions\n(i.e., the variation of signal amplitude with delay time,\nDoppler and, in this paper, direction of arrival). An\nunderstanding of the influence of geophysical parameters\non the characteristics of HF signals is important for the\ndevelopment of prediction techniques required for new\nsystems.\n2. Experimental Details\n[4] Measurements made over two paths (Figure 1\nshows their position relative to the modeled position of\nthe midlatitude ionospheric trough [Halcrow and Nisbet,\n1977] for a time of 0200 UT with Kp values of 0 and 6)\non frequencies in the range 4\u201320 MHz are presented in\nthis paper: (a) a 1400 km link along the midlatitude\ntrough with the transmitter located in Uppsala, Sweden\nand the receiver in Leicester, U.K., and (b) a 450 km link\nlocated predominantly in auroral zone between Kirkenes,\nNorway and Kiruna, Sweden. The Uppsala transmitter\noperated on a 3 minute cycle during which time trans-\nmissions were made in sequence on six frequencies in\nthe range 4 to 18 MHz, whereas the Kirkenes trans-\nmitter operated on a similar range of frequencies but on\na 20 minute cycle. In addition, an oblique ionospheric\nsounder was operated over the Uppsala to Leicester\npath to aid interpretation of the measurements. The\nsystems were operated throughout the day over the\ncourse of just over a year.\n[5] The radiated signals comprised 2 second sequences\nof 13-bit Barker coded PSK pulses modulated at (usually)\nRADIO SCIENCE, VOL. 42, RS4005, doi:10.1029\/2006RS003611, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Engineering, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0048-6604\/07\/2006RS003611$11.00\nRS4005 1 of 11\n1667 baud with a repetition rate of 80 coded pulses per\nsecond for the Uppsala transmitter, and 2000 baud with a\nrepetition rate of 66.7 coded pulses per second for the\nKirkenes transmitter. Since the transmitter and receiver\nsystems were synchronized to GPS, the absolute time of\nflight of the signals could be determined. The signals\nwere received with a large sampled aperture antenna\narray, each element of which was connected to a separate\nreceiver. The complex amplitudes of the signals received\non each antenna within the array were sampled simulta-\nneously 10000 times per second and the data processed\nto provide a measure of the relative times of flight of the\npropagating modes and their associated Doppler spectra\n(see the method employed by the DAMSON system,\ndescribed by Davies and Cannon [1993]). In this way,\nthe signal was split into components distinguished by\ntime of flight, Doppler frequency and by antenna posi-\ntion in the receiving array. A direction finding algorithm\n(usually a modified version of the Capon algorithm\n[Featherstone et al., 1997]) was then applied to each\nsignal component in turn in order to estimate the direc-\ntional characteristics of the received signal. Although the\nmodified Capon algorithm was usually employed in the\nprocessing of the experimental data, the choice of\nalgorithm is not particularly critical (see Warrington et\nal. [2000] for a discussion of the behavior of various\nalgorithms in the presence of diffuse signal energy). Note\nthat when several signal components closely separated in\ndirection of arrival are present in a single delay-Doppler\ncell, the DF algorithm may produce a single estimate of\nthe direction of arrival. This arises from the limited\nresolving capability of the DF algorithm and it is\nexpected that the estimated direction of arrival will\nusually be bounded by the limits of the direction of\narrival spread within the cell. The precise value of the\nestimated direction of arrival will vary with time as the\nrelative phases and amplitudes of the constituent compo-\nnents within the delay-Doppler cell change.\n3. Observations\n3.1. Uppsala to Leicester Path, 6.95 MHz\n[6] The Uppsala to Leicester path is about 1400 km\nlong with a great circle bearing at the receiver of\napproximately 46\u0001, and is often located under the\nexpected position of the midlatitude trough. Warrington\nand Stocker [2003] and Siddle et al. [2004a, 2004b] have\npreviously reported the statistical variations of Doppler\nand delay spread, and of time of flight and direction of\narrival as a function of time of day and of season for this\npath. Further interpretation of these measurements from\nthe point of view of variations in the channel scattering\nfunction with geomagnetic activity is presented in this\npaper.\n[7] An example nighttime scattering function for this\npath is presented in Figure 2. The signal was received on\ngreat circle (\u000146\u0001 azimuth) via a reflection from a\nsporadic E layer at a delay of around 5 ms and Doppler\nfrequency of 0 Hz (note that there may be a small\nsystematic offset in this particular parameter) and off\ngreat circle (20\u201330\u0001 azimuth) at a delay of about 7 ms. It\nis interesting to note that, in this instance, the signal\narriving at the longer delay (probably via a reflection or\nscattering from the northward trough wall) is separated\ninto two parts distinguished by different Doppler shifts\nand azimuthal directions of arrival. For further analysis,\nthe scattering function is characterized by identifying\neach of the active regions by setting a threshold of (in\nthis case) \u20136dB relative to the peak and determining the\ndelay, Doppler and direction of arrival of the resulting\nmodes and their associated spreads.\n[8] The most striking features in these measurements\nare the off-great circle modes with increased times of\nFigure 1. Map illustrating the two propagation paths\nconsidered in this paper, together with the modeled\nposition [Halcrow and Nisbet, 1977] of the midlatitude\ntrough at 0200 UT for Kp values of 0 (top) and 6\n(bottom).\nRS4005 ZAALOV ET AL.: EFFECT OF GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY\n2 of 11\nRS4005\nflight observed at night (see Siddle et al. [2004a, 2004b]\nfor more examples).\n[9] Approximately six weeks of measurements have\nbeen aggregated and plotted as a function of time of day\nin Figure 3. During the day, the measurements indicate\nthat propagation is largely on-great circle at delays of\nless than 6 ms and elevation angles of about 20\u0001 and 35\u0001,\ncorresponding to 1F and 2F modes respectively. How-\never, the most striking features in these measurements\nare the off-great circle modes with increased times of\nflight observed at night. For example, around midnight\n(UT), the signal arrives up to about 40\u0001 to the north of\nthe great circle direction accompanied by significantly\nlarger delays (up to around 9 ms), and elevation angles of\nabout 15\u0001. Previous work [Siddle et al., 2004a, 2004b;\nWarrington and Stocker, 2003; Warrington et al., 2006;\nZaalov et al., 2005] has established that this off great\ncircle propagation is consistent with the signal scattering\nfrom irregularities in the auroral oval or embedded in the\npoleward wall of the trough, accompanied by refraction\nin the trough wall when the electron density depletion in\nthe trough is such as not to support on-great circle\npropagation.\n[10] Since the position of the northern wall of the\ntrough and southern border of the auroral oval depend\non the level of geomagnetic activity, the scattering\nfunction distributions have also been plotted as a func-\ntion of Kp (Figure 4). The Kp values for individual\nmeasurements of delay and azimuth plotted in this figure\nhave been derived from the 3\u2013hourly values of Kp using\na spline interpolation. For these measurements, the\nazimuth deviation from the great circle direction\ndecreases as Kp increases, and there is a less marked\ntrend in delay with Kp, although larger delays do occur\nfor values of Kp of about 0.5, just under 1.5, and at\naround 3. This behavior is consistent with changes in the\nposition in relation to the path of the auroral oval and the\nmidlatitude trough with Kp (see Figure 1), since as\ngeomagnetic activity increases the poleward wall of the\ntrough moves southward, and therefore the reflection or\nscattering region moves to lower latitudes consequently\nreducing the azimuthal deviation from the great circle\ndirection.\n[11] However, the equatorward border of the auroral\noval is not fixed in latitude with time even in the case\nwhen Kp is fixed. In order account for this, the scattering\nFigure 2. Scattering function for the Uppsala\u2013Leicester path, 6.95 MHz, 26 December 2001,\n2118 UT. Note that the elevation angle measurements are not accurate for low elevation angles.\nThis has resulted in a cluster of points close to 0\u0001 elevation in the delay versus elevation angle plot.\nRS4005 ZAALOV ET AL.: EFFECT OF GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY\n3 of 11\nRS4005\nfunction parameters have been displayed (Figure 5) as a\nfunction of the geomagnetic colatitude of the northern\nwall of the trough at longitudes corresponding to either\nthe path midpoint, the receiver or the transmitter depend-\ning on the most likely value based on the direction of\narrival and the delay of the received signal (this is clearly\nan approximation). The model of Halcrow and Nisbet\n[1977] was used to determine the position of the pole-\nward wall of the trough and it was assumed that this\ncoincided with the southward border of the auroral oval.\nSeveral traces are evident in Figure 5, where the scatter-\ning function distributions have been plotted as a function\nof the geomagnetic colatitude of the northern wall of the\ntrough. Trace 1 corresponds to the great circle mode.\nFigure 3. Diurnal dependence of the scattering function for the Uppsala\u2013Leicester path,\n6.95 MHz, 1 December 2001 to 13 January 2002. The contours represent the fraction of the number\nof observations with values of 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 (these values are used in all figures). Note: data\nwithin 3\u0001 of the great circle azimuth have been excluded from the analysis to highlight off-great\ncircle features.\nRS4005 ZAALOV ET AL.: EFFECT OF GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY\n4 of 11\nRS4005\nTrace 2 has a fixed azimuth deviation of about 20\u0001 to the\nnorth of the great circle and probably corresponds to\nscattering from auroral irregularities. Trace 3 exhibits a\nvery pronounced trend and can be associated with\nrefraction from the northern wall of the trough. The\ndistribution of delay as a function of auroral oval\nposition is given in the lower frame of Figure 5, with\nthe various traces marked by the same numbers as in the\nazimuth case. Several features can be distinguished. The\ndelay is enhanced from geomagnetic colatitudes of about\n24\u0001 where refraction (Trace 3) is predominant, i.e., the\nincreased delay is accompanied by a strong northward\ndeviation in azimuth. This behavior follows the changes\nin the position of the auroral oval and midlatitude trough\nnorth wall. The weak trace 2, which is flat in azimuth,\nexhibits a small increasing trend in delay. This is more\nFigure 4. Scattering function correlation with Kp for the Uppsala\u2013Leicester path, 6.95 MHz,\n1 December 2001 to 13 January 2002. Note: data within 3\u0001 of the great circle azimuth have been\nexcluded from the analysis in order to highlight off-great circle features.\nRS4005 ZAALOV ET AL.: EFFECT OF GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY\n5 of 11\nRS4005\nevident when off great circle propagation due to refrac-\ntion is not supported.\n[12] As was noted above, frequencies in the range 4.5\u2013\n18 MHz were employed for these measurements. Very\nsimilar structures of off-great circle effects were observed\nat frequencies in the 7\u201314 MHz range. At the lower end\nof the frequency band (4.6 MHz), the propagation was\nlargely within a few degrees of the great circle direction,\nwhilst at the upper frequency (18.1 MHz) off-great circle\nmodes were occasionally observed, but not often enough\nto obtain reliable statistics.\n3.2. Kirkenes to Kiruna Path, 6.78 MHz\n[13] The Kirkenes to Kiruna path (450 km, great circle\nbearing at the receiver 63\u0001) is, for the most part, located\nunder the expected position of the auroral oval. For this\npath, it is interesting to note that, unlike the Uppsala to\nLeicester path, the general signal behavior does not\nexhibit regular day-to-day behavior.\nFigure 5. Azimuth and delay distribution correlation with auroral oval position for the Uppsala\u2013\nLeicester path, 6.95 MHz.\nRS4005 ZAALOV ET AL.: EFFECT OF GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY\n6 of 11\nRS4005\n[14] Presented in Figure 6 are the occurrence statistics\nof azimuth, elevation angles and delay of the individual\nmodes from approximately five weeks of measurements\nplotted as a function of time of day. The signal tends to\narrive from the great circle direction (\u000163\u0001) and at a\ndelay of 2 ms except for a few hours around local noon\n(1000 UT). This may be contrasted to the Uppsala\u2013\nLeicester path where off great circle path propagation\nwas observed at night. No signals were received in the\ninterval just before sunrise (0500\u20130700 UT) since it is\nlikely that the operating frequency exceeded the MUF at\nthis time. In the top frame, off great circle modes with\nazimuth deviations of about 40\u0001 to the south and up to\n50\u0001 to the north are evident between 0800 and 1200 UT.\nThese modes are accompanied by delays of about 3\u20134 ms\n(middle frame) and elevation angles of 40\u201360\u0001 (bottom\nframe).\n[15] Since the position of southern border of the\nauroral oval depends on the level of geomagnetic activ-\nity, then it is reasonable to expect correlation of the\nFigure 6.

In Figure 7, the\nazimuth, delay and elevation angle distributions have\nbeen plotted as a function of Kp. The distinctive off great\ncircle modes northward and southward are apparent only\nfor Kp just under \u00011, when presumably the southward\nborder of the auroral oval crosses the propagation path.\n[16] Azimuth, delay and elevation angle scattering\nfunction distributions have been plotted versus the mag-\nnetic colatitude of the southern border of the auroral oval\nin Figure 8. A southward trace (i.e., azimuths larger than\nthe great circle direction) with maximum azimuth devi-\nation from great circle of about 60\u0001 is apparent at\ncolatitudes of between 18\u0001 and 19\u0001 while a northward\ntrace is evident between 18.5\u0001 and 20\u0001 (top frame). The\nsouthward trace may be a result of the signal being\nrefracted in the steep gradients of the southern wall of the\ndayside high-latitude trough [e.g., see Pryse et al., 2005],\nwhile the northward trace is consistent with the signal\nscattering from irregularities in the auroral zone or\nrefraction from the poleward wall of the dayside trough.\nFigure 7.

The\neffects of the interplanetary magnetic field components\nand various solar wind particle fluxes on the HF meas-\nurements presented here have been investigated. With the\nexception of an intriguing effect found with different\nlevels of proton density in the solar wind measured by\nthe ACE satellite (observations were obtained from http:\/\/\nomniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov) and presented in Figure 9, no\nFigure 8.

In Figure 9, the azimuth,\nelevation and delay scattering function distributions\nhave been plotted for two bands of the proton density\nof 0\u20135\/cm3 and 5\u201330\/cm3. While both northward and\nsouthward traces of azimuth deviation are observed, the\nnorthward deviations in azimuth are weak when the\nproton density is less then 5\/cm3, but the southward\ntrace is well pronounced. By contrast, when the proton\ndensity is higher (between 5\u201330\/cm3) the azimuth is\nonly deviated northward and then only as the auroral\noval comes further south. This behavior may be related\nto changes in the morphology of the trough and auroral\noval, since as proton density increases the intensity of the\nirregularities may also increase, particularly to the north\nof the path. As a consequence, the limited dynamic range\nof our experimental system means signals deviated to the\nsouth are sufficiently weak compared to those from the\nnorth that they are no longer detected.\n4. Concluding Remarks\n[18] Observations of azimuth and delay have been\npresented for HF signals propagating over two paths:\nFigure 9.

In both cases, measurements were\ntaken over periods in excess of one year, although only\nobservations from an interval of about six weeks centred\nroughly on the winter solstice have been presented in this\npaper.\n[19] There is a strong diurnal variation in the scattering\nfunctions parameters for both paths. In the Uppsala\u2013\nLeicester case, signals arrive from azimuths significantly\noff-great circle at night, while in the Kirkenes\u2013Kiruna\ncase, off great circle propagation is only observed during\nthe day at times close to local noon. Previous work\n[Siddle et al., 2004a, 2004b] concluded that the off great\ncircle propagation observed on the Uppsala-Leicester\npath results from the signals reflected or scattered from\nthe electron density gradients or irregularities in the\npoleward wall of the trough. Since it is well known that\nthe latitude of the poleward wall of the midlatitude\ntrough tends to move to lower latitudes as Kp increases,\nthe dependence of the azimuth deviation on Kp presented\nin this paper strongly supports the previous conclusions.\n[20] Although observations presented for the Kirkenes-\nKiruna path do not exhibit a strong relationship of the\nazimuth and delay with Kp, a more pronounced correla-\ntion with position of the equatorward boundary of\nauroral oval was found \u2013 particularly for the delay. It\nis likely that this behavior arises from the presence of the\ndaytime high-latitude trough which will lie across or\nslightly to the north of the path midpoint for low Kp,\nacross or to the south for moderate Kp and well to the\nsouth for high Kp. The observed behavior also depends\non the level of particle precipitation, with only northward\ndeviated signals being detected when the proton density\nis higher than 5 cm\u00023. It may be that the occurrence of on\ngreat circle propagation for these conditions masks the\npresence of the weaker southward deviated signal.\n[21] The authors aim to develop improved techniques\nfor the prediction of HF signal characteristics for signals\npropagating via the northerly regions of the ionosphere.\nMany geophysical processes influence this region of the\nionosphere in a complex manner, and insight into how\nthe signal characteristics vary, as a function of geophys-\nical parameters is an important step towards this goal.\n[22] Acknowledgments.
