We embed our \nargument in our readings of extracts from two consciously postcolonial fictional texts. In the \nfirst part of the paper we consider geography as a discipline that is pregnant, but \u201ein trouble\u201f \nto illustrate the discipline\u201fs paradoxical struggle to be a global discipline whilst at the same \ntime marginalising the voices and perspectives that make it global. In the second part of the \npaper we consider geography as a discipline whose \u201emilk is flowing\u201f to suggest ways that the \ndiscipline can acknowledge its global interconnectedness to produce a mutually responsible \nacademic agency.  \nKey words: geography, metaphor, postcolonial, pregnancy, lactation.  \n 2 \n\u2018Geography is pregnant\u2019 and \u2018Geography\u2019s milk is flowing\u2019: metaphors for a \npostcolonial discipline? \n \nIntroduction: fertile beginnings \nRecently there has been increasing interest in the potentials that a postcolonial \nperspective offers geography and its sub-disciplines (King, 2003; Nash, 2002; Radcliffe, \n2005; Sharp and Briggs, 2006; Sylvester, 2006). There have also been some tentative \nattempts to develop a postcolonial critique of the discipline as a whole (Robinson, 2003; \nSidaway, 2000) through \u201eprovincialising\u201f Europe (Abrahamsen, 2003; Chakrabarty, 2000)1. \nPostcolonial theory offers much to geography - an understanding of the complex historical \nlayering that shapes global power relations, possible ways to overcome the divides between \ngeographies undertaken in different parts of the world (a relational way of thinking regional \ngeography), and a method that enables expression of those many voices on the margins of \nEuropean academic spaces. Much of this writing provides urgent and continued reminders of \nthe historical connections between different postcolonial spaces and their lasting legacies, \narguing that the inhabitants of imperial centres are implicated in and therefore should take \nresponsibility for the suffering that arises from the postcolonial condition. A number of \nauthors have also suggested strategies that metropolitan academics could take, emphasising \nthe need for geographers to \u201ereach out\u201f and \u201ebuild connections\u201f (McFarlane, 2006; Mercer et \nal, 2003). \n                                                 \n1\n We recognise that many geographers who do not place their work within a \n\u201epostcolonial\u201f genre do explore issues of relationship and responsibility for the discipline \n(Bonnett, 2003; Massey, 2004). For some writers `postcolonialism\u201f denies the continuing \nimportance of colonisation and (neo)colonialism. However, as Hall (1996a) notes, \n 3 \n In this paper we contribute to this literature by unsettling the 'cosy' relationship that is \ndeveloping between postcolonialism and geography. We do this in order to ensure that \npostcolonialism does not become yet another colonising discourse and practice directed from \nnorthern centres of global power, one which plays to the political rhetoric of inclusion within \nthe academy while adding further layers of delusion and amnesia of the material and \nemotional legacies of exclusion within and beyond it (Dirlik, 2004; Raghuram and Madge, \n2006; Young, 2000). We want to resist this mainstreaming impulse and reclaim the \ncontested, liberatory and radical potential that postcolonialism has to offer. And we have \nchosen to do this through the mobilisation of metaphors.   \n Postcolonial approaches, often drawing on poststructural theory, attempt both to \ndeconstruct the ways in which language reproduces binary power relations and to harness \nlanguage as a route into imagining another world. In this paper we have therefore chosen to \nutilize a linguistic tool - metaphors - towards rethinking postcolonial geography. There is a \nlarge geographical literature that critiques the ways in which geography's 'founding' \nmetaphors marginalise and exclude the experiences of many people around the globe \n(Cresswell, 1997; Rose, 1993), but the project of thinking through alternative metaphors is \nstill largely to be undertaken (Beck et al, 2003; Madge et al, 2004). We therefore want to \nexplore the possibilities offered by using some alternative metaphors in addressing the \nimperatives arising from geography\u201fs postcolonial status. The metaphors we have chosen are \nconsciously feminist, are \u201edisconcertingly incongruous\u201f (Miller, 2006, 63); they \u201ejar\u201f against \naccepted ways of thinking, speaking and writing geography. We want to deploy the \nastonishment and the friction to create \u201ediscrepant experiences\u201f (Said, 1993, 35) that can \n                                                                                                                                                 \npostcolonialism does not begin with the end of colonialism, but instead interrogates the \n 4 \nspark the imagination, open up possibilities for dialogue and create fertile imaginings of \ngeography\u201fs postcolonial potential. \n In particular, we want to explore the potential offered by pregnancy and lactation as \nmetaphors for a reconstructed geography - to see how this unexpected combination might \nrender geography unrecognisable, how the boundaries of geography might be altered and \ntransgressed if they were placed centre stage. This attempt to use a corporeal vocabulary, \ninformed by feminist politics to embody geography is particularly influenced by postcolonial \nfeminist interventions which read the seemingly natural processes of pregnancy and lactation \nnot only for how they are culturally constituted but also how they are shaped by coagulations \nof power (Jolly, 1998, 2). We use these bodily experiences as metaphors for (re)producing \ngeographies within the postcolonial context, because the richness of these metaphors offer us \nproductive ways of thinking of \u201econnections\u201f, \u201edynamic relationalities\u201f and responsibilities \n(Environment and Planning D, 2004, 22, 1). \n Our two metaphors, pregnancy and lactation are drawn respectively from two \npostcolonial fictional texts- Zee Edgell\u201fs (1982) Beka Lamb and Toni Morrison\u201fs (1987) \nBeloved to explore how the connections that mark postcolonial geographies might be best \nimagined as constitutive of contemporary British academic geography. We suggest that \nBritish geography is already a postcolonial discipline because of its historical linkages; these \nlinkages and relationships are already in place. We use the metaphors to press British \ngeographers to acknowledge the claims of the different constituents that go to make up the \ndiscipline and above all, to respond to these claims. We therefore hold that both metaphors \noffer great potential to \u201emobilize the body in our speech in such a way that we are not \n                                                                                                                                                 \nvalidity of  `independence\u201f as a historical cut-off point. \n 5 \nimmediately led to the usual discussions about dualism and holism\u201f (Latour, 2004, 206) but \ninstead highlight connections. We think that this mobilisation will also help us to address the \nimperatives arising from geography\u201fs postcolonial relationships- relationships in which \nBritish academic geography is simultaneously both a part of, and apart from, other people \nand places. \n The rest of the paper is structured into five parts. In the first part we place our \narguments about postcolonialism in the context of literatures on metaphor, pregnancy and \nlactation. We then explain our methodology and the choice of metaphors. The third and \nfourth parts examine each of these texts and metaphors in turn.  In the third section we \nconsider British academic geography as a discipline that is pregnant but \u201ein trouble\u201f. This \nmetaphor offers us a route into reflecting critically about the relationality of British academic \ngeography in a postcolonial world and its constitution in relation to popular global \ngeographies. But the discipline is also \u201ein trouble\u201f through its paradoxical struggle to be a \nglobal discipline, while at the same time consistently denying the voices and perspectives \nthat make it global. We use an extract from Zee Edgell\u201fs (1982) novel, Beka Lamb, to \nexplore these issues and to expose the ultimately destructive fragmentation that denial of \nrelationality can bring. In the fourth section we consider British geography as a discipline \nwhose \u201emilk is flowing' to suggest ways that the discipline can acknowledge its global \ninterconnectedness to produce a responsible academic agency. Through an extract from Toni \nMorrison\u201fs (1987) Beloved, we highlight the ways in which \u201espeaking\u201f geography in terms of \nintense body experiences such as pregnancy and lactation (Warren and Brewis, 2004), \nexperiences which are commonly denied expression in the dominant symbolic order \n(Davidson, 2001, 285), creates spaces to reveal the postcoloniality of geography and to \n 6 \nexplore the responsibilities that arises from that position. In the final section we theorise the \nwider generative potential of such corporeal metaphors in working with difference in a \nglobalised world. But first we explore the potentials offered by metaphors for postcolonial \nanalysis. \n \nOn metaphor, pregnancy, and lactation \nThe generative potential of metaphor \nThe multiple disciplinary origins of postcolonial theorising - drawing on literary \ntheory (Ashcroft et al., 1989), history, especially as subaltern studies (see Spivak, 1988), and, \nin the UK, cultural studies (see Morley and Chen, 1996) - has meant that postcolonial \ntheorists have a range of historically and spatially sensitive linguistic and discursive tools for \nunderstanding material relations (although it may be a peculiarly western inference that \nlanguage is opposed to materiality cf Jameson, 1986; Parry, 2004). Besides, much \npostcolonial theorising also occurs outside formal disciplinary structures, transcending and \nintercalating between these structures offering an imaginative, creative element, which is \nrooted in its position, but also then creating space and strategies to enable crucial global \nconnections to be made apparent.  For this \u201espace clearing\u201f work, metaphor has been a \ncentral literary device.  \n Metaphors\n2\n are powerful rhetorical devices that provide a way of understanding one \nconcept through the use of another concept that resonates with the first, has significant \n                                                 \n2\n Despite feminist critiques of metaphor as a masculinist concept and feminist preference \nfor use of metonymy (see Bondi, 1997), we use metaphors because they do not refer \ndirectly \u201eto a changing of the designations of things by names or nouns; it mentions only \nthe relationship between ideas\u201f (Ricoeur, 2003, 65). Our use of pregnancy and lactation \naims to highlight them in their verb form, to see the dormant potentiality of existence, to \n 7 \nparallels with it, but does not mimic it (Barnes and Gregory, 1997; Cloke et al, 2004, 360). \nThe force of metaphor is what McCloskey describes, tellingly for this paper, its \u201epregnant \nquality\u201f (McCloskey, 1985, 77), the way a small phrase can store a huge number of far-\nreaching and often unintended revelations and implications through the mutual exchange \nbetween two seemingly entirely different discourses. This is done in order to make the world \nmore knowable, allowing the relatively new to resonate with the conceptual framework of the \nrelatively known.  And in this transference metaphors become central to the construction of \ninterpretations and ideas so that language or even thought can be understood as intrinsically \nmetaphorical (McCloskey, 1985). \n When deployed within an academic discipline, metaphors have a normative function. \nThey structure schools of thought, help to determine research agendas and so alter the nature \nof geographic knowledge. Metaphors construct and depict disciplines while disciplines \nactively shape this understanding by recruiting particular metaphors to their disciplinary \nproject. Metaphors therefore serve as \u201einstruments of power\u201f (Chase, 2001, 184) - displacing, \nsilencing and marginalizing the interests of groups of significant \u201eothers\u201f and through this \nsilencing deciding whose concerns are represented within a discipline such as geography. \nThrough the metaphors that are used (as well as those that are not) we decide both what is \ngeography and who does geography. \n Unpicking metaphors, their long and complicated histories, and the ways in which \nthey have been used as tools in the construction and legitimation of power relations, then \nbecomes an urgent task for those trying to understand why we do what we do in geography. \n                                                                                                                                                 \nsee the latent capacity of action as actualized (Ricoeur, 2003, 48). Moreover, we also \nwant to resist and reclaim the use of metaphor for our own particular subversive feminist \nintentions.  \n 8 \nAs such, many geographical sub-disciplines have attempted to deconstruct their central \nmetaphors (see for instance, in economic geography, Cameron and Gibson-Graham, 2003; \ndevelopment geographies, Slater and Bell, 2002; Noxolo, 2004, 2006; and feminist \ngeographies, Nash, 1996). Meta-concepts such as \u201espace\u201f, which are central to the whole \ngeographical discipline, too have been critiqued within the deconstructive project that \ngeographers have undertaken (Smith and Katz, 1993; Pratt, 1997).  \n However, if we accept Beck et al\u201fs (2003, 1) assertion that the \u201esocial sciences need \nto construct new concepts to understand the world dynamics at the beginning of the 21st \ncentury\u201f, then just seeking to examine how our current metaphors discipline the discipline is \nnot enough. We need to explore the potential of new metaphors for geography too. \nDeveloping new metaphors becomes an important way to open up the possibility of multiple \ngenealogies in geography and of revisioning how, and who does geographical work. Their \n\u201eopen-endedness or inexplicitness\u201f (Boyd, 1979, 357) allows the expression (or at least \nintimation) of concepts that are not fully comprehended and for which a literal set of terms is \nnot available. But metaphors also make that which is new or strange a little less intimidating \nby providing familiar concepts as bridges or steps. Thus, new disciplinary metaphors can \nprovide \u201ehooks\u201f into new ways of thinking, providing us with the ability to move beyond our \ncurrent discursive limits, and enabling us to reshape our geographical projects.  \n Metaphors do not simply jumble up words or transfer meaning but they are defined in \nmovement, through upsetting the classificatory tendencies and the order in existing use of \nlanguage, taxonomies and logic (Ricoeur, 2003). According to Rorty (1989, 9), it is also a \nspeculative discourse which \u201esays things like \"try thinking of it this way\" - or more \nspecifically, \"try to ignore the apparently futile traditional questions by substituting the \n 9 \nfollowing new and possibly interesting questions.\" It does not pretend to have a better \ncandidate for doing the same old things which we did when we spoke in the old way. Rather, \nit suggests that we might want to stop doing those things and do something else. But it does \nnot argue for this suggestion on the basis of antecedent criteria common to the old and the \nnew language games. For just insofar as the new language really is new, there will be no such \ncriteria.\u201f  \n So using metaphor is one way to make links between postcolonial perspectives and \ngeography, links that are \u201edecisive\u201f (Hall, 1996b, 269) in terms of being able to suggest and \ngenerate change, but not \u201edefinitive\u201f (Hall, 1996c, 441) in that they do not necessarily narrow \ndown the range of \u201ediscrepant\u201f juxtapositions and comparisons that postcolonial perspectives \ncould bring to geography. Drawing on metaphors from postcolonial literature can be \nparticularly useful because as Peake and Kobayashi (2002, 57) suggest, in discussing the use \nof literature by black people as one facet of an anti-racist curriculum in geography teaching, \nthis is a way of \u201egiving voices to the experience of racialized people\u201f marginalised within \nacademic geography. This is important, for the postcolonial is concerned with voice (see \nbelow). The emotional and connotational power of metaphors can then be deployed both to \ninterrogate current academic practices but also to open up the possibilities of redressing \ncurrent lacunae in our geographical imaginings by tracing relationships between formerly \ndisconnected entities without subsuming those entities within our imaginings. In the next \nsection we argue that pregnancy and lactation are two such metaphors that can be used to \nimagine geography anew. \nPregnancy and lactation as fertile metaphors \n 10 \nWe chose these metaphors because pregnancy and lactation are world-wide \nexperiences that offer the potential for transnational understanding. Being inside a pregnant \nbody is one of the rare events that all humans experience -  a condition of human existence \nglobally. While lactation is a much more selective experience it too is common. Yet despite \ntheir prevalence and significance to the social, economic, political and psychological realities \nof many women\u201fs lives, they still remain remarkably invisible in dominant intellectual \nregimes. \nAdopting new metaphors is always a risky strategy.  Pregnancy and lactation are not \nblank sheets. They are sites of contestation between different forms of disciplining, caught \nbetween contradictory but interconnected discourses of production and reproduction, \nbetween science and nature, and as a result between medicalisation and naturalness, \ninherently unsettling these binaries. And these experiences are imbued with power relations \nso that certain discourses are privileged while others are subdued. For instance, pregnant and \nlactating bodies have been subjected to enormous amounts of surveillance, read as \nmedicalised conduits or as precultural naturalised wombs (Book, 1999; Underhill-Sem, \n2001). On the other hand, the possibility of biological interventions in pregnancy - eugenics, \nsex selective abortion, designer babies - are numerous. Similarly, breast-feeding too is \npositioned in a world of many images: of bonny \u201ebottle-fed\u201f babies, scrawny breasts \nproviding little nutrition in a world of heart-rending deprivation, sexualised breasts and \n(relatedly) privatised breast-feeding. Women who have struggled to wrest control over their \npregnancies and their breast-feeding from the intense scrutiny and intervention of scientific \nprofessionals may therefore balk at using metaphors that can simply re-instate women within \nthe power hierarchies of the biological professions. \n 11 \n Both pregnancy and lactation also evoke and provoke a variety of emotions. They act \nforcefully as social regulatory ideals - the supposed route to physical and emotional \nfulfilment essential to be a \u201ereal\u201f woman - an ideal which can oppress and suppress those \nbodies that cannot or do not engage in these \u201edefinitively\u201f feminine activities. On the other \nhand, the social mores and moral panics that surround teenage pregnancy tell us about the \nkinds of bodies that should not become pregnant while the social outrage at breastfeeding in \nparticular public spaces informs us about the restricted spaces available to lactating women \n(Longhurst, 2001a).  Societal desire to regulate reproducing bodies has rarely been greater. \nHence, pregnancy and lactation, like any other metaphors, will carry their own social, \ncultural and moral force, which must be acknowledged. And these forces (and hence \npregnancy and lactation) will be experienced differently in different places and times \n(Underhill-Sem, 2001). The ability even to talk about them, much less to picture them, may \nbe severely restricted in some places, whereas the commoditisation and fetishisation of \npregnancy and lactation in other places may place a raft of unintended connotations on \nimages of the pregnant or breast-feeding bodies.  \n These objections do not necessarily outlaw the use of pregnancy and lactation as \nmetaphors - it only necessitates contextualising strategies. And we think it is politically \nexpedient and intellectually enabling to play with them for a number of reasons. If Foucault \n(2004) is right in arguing that biopolitics is at the centre of Western modes of power, then \nunderstanding that power as exercised in and through our discipline requires that we take on \nboard \u201ebody talk\u201f, the many ways in which the body is engaged in accounts about the \ndisciplinary work that it does (Latour, 2004). To this end, we believe that pregnancy and \nlactation can give birth to a range of interesting perspectives on the discipline. Inserting these \n 12 \nmetaphors into the frame and genealogy of geography forces us to rethink geography\u201fs \nlimit(ation)s and boundaries and the processes through which the discipline reproduces itself. \nThrough their inherent generative potential, metaphors of pregnancy and lactation help us to \naddress the question of \u201ewhat next?\u201f (Dixon and Jones, 2004), while avoiding the \u201elogic of \nthe corpse, interested in the broken, the static, the already passed\u201f, producing something \n\u201elivelier\u201f (Thrift, 2004a, 83). These metaphors bring forth creative possibilities and \nunfinished agendas of and for geography, the voices of those not yet born, whose knowledge \nwe do not yet know of, cannot currently conceptualise, but which will bring with them new \nconcerns and critical interventions. These metaphors not only vivify our discipline but also \nintroduce the spark of imagination into \u201ethinking more\u201f at the conceptual level (Ricoeur, \n2003, 358).  \nThey also offer an opportunity to overturn both Plato and Nietzsche's use of spiritual \npregnancy (in opposition to bodily pregnancy) as a metaphor for creativity and imagination, \n(Mullins 2002) by insisting on the intellectual and physical creativity of the full pregnant \nbody. This feminist rethinking of pregnancy in more positive terms (Kristeva, 1986; Rich, \n1976) has probably been taken furthest within geography by Robyn Longhurst (2001a). She \nargues that the pregnant body can function as a metaphor that challenges geography\u201fs \ndisciplinary boundaries, emphasising its fluidity and challenging its exclusions. For her \u201e[t]he \npregnant body acts as a useful motif for geography\u201fs disciplinary body\u201f (Longhurst, 2001b, \n65), because the flows of fluid between the mother and child parallel the flow of ideas within \nand across the discipline. And highlighting the instability of both disciplinary bodies and \npregnant bodies is a political act - forcing us to recognise these spaces \u201eas spaces of self and \n 13 \nother, embodied subjectivity, and politics\u201f (Longhurst, 2001b, 65). It thus makes way for a \npolitics that takes account of and makes space for the \u201eother\u201f. \n The lactating body has received much less attention than the pregnant body in \ngeography, even in feminist theory (but see Bartlett and Giles, 2004). However, inherently \nspatial questions around the public breast (Parks, 2004), about questions of relationality and \nethics that breast-feeding evoke (Shaw, 2003), the detailing of breast-feeding practices that \nqueer the heteronormative narrative of breast-feeding (Giles, 2004), as well as the dyadic \nrelation between mother and child which this norm presupposes, are increasingly gaining \nattention. Postcolonial theorists have also explored the role of lactation in the European \ncolonial imaginary, its enormous symbolic force, not as a metaphor, but as a potent factor in \nthe transmission of racial and national heritage (Stoler, 1995). Breastmilk itself is coming \nunder scrutiny as a material and representational field in its own right. As Angiers (1999, \n147) suggests \u201eHuman milk\u2026 is so rich, so pregnant with meaning and attribute, that like a \nbubbling solution in a mad scientist\u201fs beaker, it practically crackles to life - and beyond\u201f. So \nlactating breasts may be read as \u201efertile grounds of wisdom, active organs producing food for \nthe mind as well as the body\u201f (Bartlett, 2000, 183).  Importantly, this literature is also \nbeginning to outline new practices emerging around breastfeeding where it is becoming a \npart of \u201ea postcolonial and postmodern enterprise, which carefully negotiates competing \ncultures, institutions, epistemologies and discursive regimes\u201f (Bartlett and Giles, 2004, 271). \nBut there is significantly less work about how lactation can function as a metaphor.  \n To summarise: being inside a pregnant body is one of the few subjective positions \nthat we have all occupied but we focus here not on this experientiality, but on pregnancy and \nlactation as metaphors for geography. In doing so we are however conscious of the \n 14 \nsignificant disconnections that readers may feel in the use of these particular metaphors- \nthose who cannot or do not want to give birth, those whose pregnancies and lactation have \nbeen marked by loss, or those for whom these are simply irrelevances (see Madge et al, 2004 \nfor a detailed discussion). By thinking pregnancy and lactation both through our adult bodies, \nand through the subjectivities of those yet unborn we hope to alter the scope of these \ndisconnections. Besides, thinking these processes metaphorically enables us to locate these \nmetaphors in what Ricoeur (2003, 354) calls their \u201eontological vehemence\u201f which \u201ecuts \nmeaning from its initial anchor, frees it as the form of a movement and transposes it to a new \nfield to which the meaning can give form by means of its own figurative property'. \nMetaphors of pregnancy and lactation may not work universally but they will be effective \nsometimes and in some places to unsettle existing ways of thinking and writing geography. \nWe therefore offer only contingent readings of each metaphor that recognizes its own limits \nbut we insist, too, that they also have the potential to push beyond the limits of existing \ngeographical language. Thus using these metaphors is for us an inclusionary not exclusionary \nprocess, which in explored below in the light of our methodology. \n \nPregnancy and lactation as metaphors in place  \nThere is a large literature on the intersections between literature and geographical \nknowledge (Barnes and Duncan, 1992; Kneale, 2003; Sharp, 2000). Geographers from \nhumanistic, radical and regional perspectives have all deployed literature in a realist manner -\nas evocative and accurate depictions of place- used to add flavour and depth to geographical \ndescriptions of landscape (Darby, 1948; Pocock, 1988). While the literary text may indeed \nprovide \u201ethick description\u201f, Brosseau (1994) rightly points out that the novel is more than just \n 15 \na resource from which to excavate geographical facts or richly subjective accounts of place. \nSharp (2000) develops a more nuanced vision of the relationship between geography and \nliterature in attempting to offer an engagement with literary fiction which analyses the \ncontent and form of the text, but also leaves room for its distinctive voice, embedded in \ncomplex power relations involved in critical reading, writing context and reception. It is this \ndistinctive voice that we are particularly interested in because postcolonial theory is crucially \nconcerned with voice, with the ability to write\/speak back (Ashcroft et al, 1989), because its \nobject is not only the decentring of the West but crucially a re-balancing of the West with the \nrest of the world (Hall, 1992). It deconstructs that enlightenment subjectivity that defined the \ncolonial and \u201eothered\u201f rest of the world in relation to it, but crucially it also seeks to re-\nconstitute subject positions from which people around the world can find voice to speak \nabout themselves. Politically, it is a work of reclamation rather than just renunciation, of \nrespect and reconstruction rather than just deconstruction and anti-racism or anti-sexism (see \nTuhiwai-Smith, 1999, 120).  \n Reading as practice is not neutral. Its history and status as a form of 'cultural capital' \nmeans that keeping \u201ereading\u201f of postcolonial literary texts open requires a consciously \ndialogic approach which emphasizes the relationship between the text(s) and a community of \nreaders. In taking this approach we are reading into the texts the specific context in which the \nhistorical relations of power, from the body to the global political economy, are \nsynchronously linked and laid bare. We are using fiction as a site of discourse that allows for \nthe idea that meanings of a text may be multiple and contradictory, but also that reading a \ntext can become \u201ea way of doing cultural history\u2026or an exploration of imaginary or \nimagined geographies\u201f (Johnson et al, 2004, 199). We read the texts discursively for the \n 16 \nimagined geographies they can provoke, to labour towards a postcolonial geography \nundulating with metaphorical visions.  \nOur metaphors are drawn from two extracts from postcolonial literature, Zee Edgell\u201fs \n(1982) novel, Beka Lamb and Toni Morrison's (1987) Beloved. The texts are both set in the \nAmericas (Central and North America), historical and both were published in the 1980s. But \nthey are deployed here not for their representativeness or for their token, homogeneous, \nessentialised subalternity, but because we think they help us to explore geography\u201fs \npostcolonial potential. In selecting these texts we are less concerned with their form and \ncontent than in their distinctive voice, a voice that has been shaped by particular social, \neconomic and racialised power relations and circumstances, a voice which is commonly \nmarginalised in geographical writing. These extracts are used as exemplars of the embodied \nexperiences of the (post)colonial public who have been so long excluded, but so long a silent \npresence in geographical enquiry. According to Sharp and Briggs (2006, 8), such accounts \nare \u201emeaningful because of their reliance on the details of the reality which they seek to \narticulate for their audiences\u2026the novelist\u201fs imagination does offer the possibility of a more \nengaged analysis for development studies\u201f. Novels can infuse a keener sense of local texture \nfrom close range and emphasise the complexity of humanity but the politics they record can \nbe messy, often nasty and the experiences they articulate can convey the relentless \nexperiences of lives in conflict and pain (Sylvester, 2006, 66, 70, 75). They are also texts that \ndeal with women, and pregnancy, and power and through their profoundly emotional and \nembodied expressions, they demand attention and make an (albeit limited) entry point for the \npostcolonial female subject. This entry is, of course, through our translation, thus asserting a \ndegree of authorial authority (cf Bondi, 1997) which has the potential to undermine the \n 17 \npostcolonial project. However, we contend that the limitations of collusion aside, we can still \ndeploy the texts for neither text suggests \u201enaturalness\u201f or universality of pregnancy; rather, \nthey place the pregnant body within a social and economic order. . \n More specifically though, this article argues that postcolonial relationships are always \nalready present and constitutive of British academic geography.  Therefore we have selected \ntexts that have been marketed and read internationally, but hold different positions in relation \nto British academic work.  Beka Lamb is an influential novel with an established place both \nin Central American literature and the Caribbean literary canon (Boyce Davies and Savory \nFido, 1990, 23; Donnell and Lawson Welch, 1996, 365) - a number of academic studies have \nbeen published on it internationally (see McKoy, 1999).  However, despite its rich and multi-\nlayered portrait of the social context of pre-independence Belize for young women in \nparticular, use of the novel within some academic disciplines is only just beginning (see for \nexample Macpherson, 2003).  In contrast, Beloved, set in North America around the time of \nthe abolition of slavery, has become a global academic industry, with thousands of \ncommentaries in a range of disciplines including British academic geography, analysing its \nuse of narrative, its ghostly motifs and its range of themes, including maternity and memory \n(see Frampton, 2005; Tolia-Kelly, 2004). Moreover, Morrison herself is an important \npostcolonial theorist, making influential academic contributions about North America\u201fs \npostcoloniality and the ways in which its mainstream literary canon should be read through \nrace (Morrison, 1993; Gilroy, 1993a).  Leaving aside the question of international publishing \npractices that underpin sales disparities between writers from different parts of the world (see \nCanagarajah, 2002 and Heiss, 2003), we deploy these two texts as examples of the ways in \nwhich postcolonial literary texts are already in different degrees of dialogue with disciplines. \n 18 \nMoreover, each text places pregnancy and lactation within social and economic contexts that \nhave something to say to British academic geography as a postcolonial discipline: Beka \nLamb places pregnancy in the context of the colonial educational institutions through which \ngeographical theories about the tropics, about development and about global power relations \nwere both developed and disseminated; whilst Beloved places lactation in the context of \nslavery, understood in a wide range of postcolonial literature as a horror at the heart of \nmodern global institutions including academic ones (Plasa and Ring, 1994).  Our reading of \npregnancy and lactation as metaphors has its specific context within these texts, and in \n(re)reading the novels we align ourselves with a growing acknowledgement within the \ndiscipline of these critical voices and their distinctive contributions.  In the next section we \nexplore these contributions through the metaphor \u201egeography is pregnant\u201f. \n \n\u2018Geography is pregnant and in trouble\u2019: acknowledging postcolonial publics \nBritish academic geographers have recently expressed some troubling concerns \naround the failure to impact on public policy (Martin, 2001), the wall of incomprehension \nbetween tertiary and secondary\/primary geographical education (Bonnett, 2003), the \ndiscipline\u201fs relative lack of engagement with places outside Europe and North America \n(Environment and Planning D 2003, 21, 2), and the continued hegemony of theory developed \nin British and American geography departments (Raghuram and Madge, 2006; Robinson, \n2003). These concerns have been particularly important for development geographers, whose \nengagement with these \u201edistant places\u201f has led to feelings of marginalisation within the \ndiscipline, resulting in some to call for an increase in Area Studies, and in international \ncollaboration (Bebbington, 2003; Healey et al, 2000; Potter, 2001). \n 19 \n Without proclaiming an interest in postcolonial theory, Bonnett (2003, 56) has gone \nfurthest towards linking this lack of engagement with a withdrawal behind national borders, \nin the context of geography\u2019s colonial past, when he states that: \u201eacademic geography, far \nfrom having \u201edealt with\u201f or \u201emoved on from\u201f its imperial past has merely avoided it...\u201f  \nWhilst recognising its own colonial foundations, and becoming increasingly reflexive in \nspeaking for or about \u201ethe other\u201f in a postcolonial world, British academic geography takes \nan elitist form that equates a pre-occupation with the global with unreflexive colonial bigotry. \nUltimately, Bonnett argues that: \u201egeography is founded upon and inextricably tied to the \n\u201eglobal claim\u201f. Moreover\u2026 this claim cannot be escaped without severing academic \ngeographers from\u2026 their own responsibility to create and disseminate critical and non-\nparochial traditions of world knowledge\u201f (Bonnett, 2003, 61).   \n In using the metaphor of pregnancy as it is situated within Beka Lamb, we want to \nargue that it is precisely the postcoloniality of British academic geography that both defines it \nthrough its global relationships and also involves a denial of them.  In the novel, Toycie, a \nyoung student at a distinguished Christian academy in an unspecified country\u201fs last few years \nof formal imperialism, finds that she is pregnant.  In this extract, her friend\u201fs father (Bill \nLamb) argues her case for remaining in the academy whilst the girl and her mother, Miss \nEila, watch in anguished and impotent silence.  However Sister Virgil, the principal of the \nacademic institution, is implacable:  \n \u201e\u2026In cases like this, we believe it is entirely up to the modesty of the girl to prevent \nthese happenings.  Our girls are warned of this likelihood, and the possible consequences.  \nNot all girls who get into trouble here are of Toycie\u201fs calibre.  Believe me I hesitated, waited, \n 20 \npraying we might be mistaken.  One day, these things might change, but right now these are \nthe rules, and I am truly sorry.\u201f \nThe silence in the room had a frightening quality and Bill Lamb, taking his hat off the table, \nsaid,  \n\u201eWell, Sister, Miss Eila and I will leave you now with Toycie, as I can see, as you say, there \nis nothing you can do\u2026 But because of Miss Eila here, and because of Toycie, I feel I must \ntell you this: you have been principal of this academy for two years so maybe you don\u201ft yet \nrealize the financial strain people are under in this country.  Families without resources have \nno strings to pull when their children get in trouble\u2026  You say things will change, Sister.  \nIt\u201fll be too late for Toycie here, and others like her, but the woman brave enough to make \nthat change should be crowned Queen of the Bay at Battlefield Park\n3\n! \nSister Virgil\u201fs blue eyes reflected the glint of the window panes sparkling in the room.  \nSwinging her cross like a pendulum, she said,  \n\u201eWe women must learn to control our emotions, Mr Lamb.  There are times we must stand up \nand say \u201eenough\u201f whatever our feelings.  The rate of illegitimacy is quite high and has been \nhigh for a long time.  The women will have to decide for a change in their lives, otherwise \nthey will remain vulnerable.  Under prevailing conditions, I cannot see much hope for the \nlong-term development of this country.  This, Mr Lamb, is in large part, what we try to teach \nin this academy.\u201f \nToycie fell forward onto the floor\u2026 \n                                                 \n3\n If Sister Virgil is \u201ebrave enough to make the change\u201f and accept pregnant girls like \nToycie into her institution, then she should be crowned \u201eQueen of the Bay at Battlefield \nPark\u201f for challenging modalities of power based on class, gender and colonial relations \nthat construct pregnancy as problematic. In Belize City this park was a site of labour \n 21 \n(Edgell, 1982, 119-120)  \nEvelyn O\u201fCallaghan (1993) has revealed the unbearable postcolonial tension between \nthe need to conform to the demands of colonial educators and gatekeepers who will only \naccept rational, pure, integrated and domesticated colonial subjects, and the day-to-day \nrealities of double standards in terms of gender, cultural ambivalence in morality, and an \nemotional intensity driven by poverty and inequality, that leads to a sensation of \ndisintegration of the subject, and ultimately to death (O\u201fCallaghan, 1993, 36-42). The \nvulnerability of Toycie\u201fs pregnant body, her poverty and her youth, set against the \nimpenetrable surfaces of Sister Virgil\u201fs blue eyes, her cross, and her rationality, brings out \nthe terrible emotional and material impact of this tension. However, Toycie\u201fs pregnant body, \nstill wearing her uniform, bears graphic witness to the continued involvement of this young \nwoman in the society around her \u2013 more than that, it bears witness to the impossibility of \ncomplete separation between the academic and popular, no matter how much the academy \nseeks to patrol that border. Toycie is excluded from the academy in a disciplinary procedure \nthat seeks to define not only the purity of the academy but also the profligacy of the \nsurrounding society. The academy sees itself as teaching development, even civilisation, to \nthe chosen few, rescuing them from the \u201eunderdeveloped\u201f, \u201ehopeless\u201f society surrounding \nthem. Ultimately, the separation is between colonial centre and periphery, between dominator \nand dominated. However, Mr Lamb\u201fs comments about \u201epulling strings\u201f show that such a \ndivision is by no means inalienable, relying more on money and social class than on \nprinciples. In the short term Toycie pays a harsh price in this disciplinary game, losing first \n                                                                                                                                                 \nactivism through the first part of the twentieth century and became an important place in \nchallenging the colonial regime. \n 22 \nher sanity, then her life.  But ultimately both Mr Lamb and Sister Virgil know that it is the \nacademy that will have to change.  \n We chose this piece because it works at both an experiential and a metaphorical level. \nOn an experiential level, it dramatises a clash between the academy as institution and a \npregnant body, which is discursively linked here to immodesty, rule-breaking, poverty, lack \nof control, irrationality, illegitimacy, vulnerability and ultimately underdevelopment.  For \nmany women around the world, both before and after formal national independence, \npregnancy outside socially regulated mores foreclosed the possibility of education, of career \naspirations, and of respectability - a pregnant body is, in this reading, \u201ein trouble\u201f4. Defined, \nlike the whole country in which the scene takes place, in terms of hopelessness, the pregnant \nbody is ejected from the academy. But what is discursively constructed as \u201etrouble\u201f is the \npregnant body that becomes pregnant before it is \u201eschooled\u201f.  Toycie may reproduce in the \nfuture but only when she has changed, learned to control her emotions, been disciplined.  \n In British academic geography, as in Sister Virgil\u201fs academy, women have a place. The \ndiscipline has moved over to accommodate women (the Royal Geographical Society accepted \nfemale members in 1913), and less commonly people of colour (Potter, 2001; Pulido, 2002), \nbut on what terms? They have to be schooled, to \u201efollow the rules\u201f, to \u201echange\u201f, or they will \n\u201eremain vulnerable\u201f. The investment that academic geography has in reason, control and \nrationality means that the seepages, the filtrations and the flows across disciplinary \n                                                 \n4\n In this section we have \u201eplayed\u201f with the notion of being \u201ein trouble\u201f. We deliberately \nmove between \u201etrouble\u201f as socially constructed disciplinary tool, and a realist version of \ntrouble as something to be avoided. We also cast different protagonists into the position \nof being \u201ein trouble\u201f, highlighting the contingency and the ambivalence of the metaphor \nof pregnancy as trouble. \n 23 \nboundaries too must be controlled and rationalised. The filters change as do the vectors of \ninclusion but the terms of inclusion are already set. The \u201einfiltrators\u201f must follow the rules. \n Moreover, like Sister Virgil, many academics believe that \u201eone day these things might \nchange but right now these are the rules\u201f. Thus, despite long discussions about the need to \nalter British geography\u201fs relations with geographies in other places, we seem to be unable to \nmake the wholesale changes required towards this. And we are truly sorry but the terms of \ninclusion into British geographic debates cannot really be changed. Only people whose \nability to be calibrated on \u201eour\u201f scale can be let in. The possibilities for change, the agency \nlies elsewhere - in the bodies who have traditionally been marginalised, because right now, it \nis they who will have to change to fit the rules. \n In this experiential reading, Sister Virgil may be considered to stand in for geography \nbut, in a much more daring metaphorical reading, what if we read Toycie as British academic \ngeography?  Then, we start to think about geography as itself pregnant, pregnant with its \npostcolonial publics.  As Bonnett (2003) argues, what British academic geography means \nshould not be regarded simply as a private academic matter but as \u201ea form and result of \npublic knowledge\u201f (Bonnett, 2003, 58).  If this is true for public knowledge developed in and \nthrough imperialism in the metropole, it is also true for public knowledge developed in and \nthrough imperialism in the colonies, whether this knowledge \u201ewrites back\u201f to the metropole \nin geographic or in literary forms.  The everyday spatiality of this postcolonial public, \nrecognised in social science and geographical theory as produced partly through geographical \npractice (Gregory, 2005, 184), is indeed complex, transnational, fundamentally postmodern \n(Gilroy, 1993a).  It is decentred and fragmented in terms of home\/belonging, it is defined by \nflows of ideas, knowledge, people, it is characterised by ruptures and lacunae, but most \n 24 \nimportantly for the discipline, it is thoroughly multivocal. This multivocality is only very \nslowly being acknowledged as historically rooted, in that first world academic disciplines \nhave been profoundly shaped by the knowledges and discoveries of the people they helped to \ncolonise and enslave (Bell et al, 1995, 4; Bonnett, 2003, 57; Gregory, 1994). The reality for \nBritish geography is that it is a postcolonial discipline that is pregnant with the claims of a \nglobal postcolonial public that have a range of stories to tell, a range of historical and \ncontemporary geographical perspectives with \u201ea multiplicity of trajectories\u201f (see Massey, \n2001, 16). \n What the metaphor \u201eGeography is pregnant but in trouble\u201f highlights, grounded in the \nstory of Toycie, is the tragic consequence of British academic geography\u201fs attempts to deny \nthis pregnancy, these silent presences that make it what it is.  As Bonnett (2003, 59-60) has \nargued, academic geography polices the borders between the academic and the popular, \nborrowing heavily from Euro-American social science and inventing technical knowledges, \nin order to find a place that does not rely on these connections.  However, ultimately the \ndiscipline only loses its distinctiveness and its identity in so doing.  British geography \nattempts to theorise a globalised world of flows and multiple perspectives, whilst denying the \nmultivocal, decentralised, postcolonial discipline that is inside its own belly.  \n In the next section we explore this multivocality further. We explore the links and \nrelationships involved in geography\u201fs pregnancy and we do so through a metaphor about \nlactation. We use the metaphor \u201egeography\u201fs milk is flowing\u201f to suggest ways that the \ndiscipline can acknowledge its global interconnectedness to produce a mutually responsible \nacademic agency. In this reading the body of the discipline is a leaking vessel, with insecure \n 25 \nboundaries, but this body is fully equipped to engage responsibly with the relational legacy \nof its colonial past, and (re)produce a distinctively postcolonial academic identity.  \n \n\u2018Geography\u2019s milk is flowing\u2019: relationality and responsible geographies \nAs a route into writing postcolonial multivocality back into academic geography, in \nthis section we re-imagine responsibility through the metaphor \u201egeography\u201fs milk is flowing'.   \nSpecifically, we employ the metaphor of lactation, as it is used in Beloved.  In using this \nmetaphor we make a contribution to emerging discussions around breast-feeding in feminist \ntheory (see especially, Bartlett and Giles, 2004).  Here, the everyday task of breastfeeding is \nseen to \u201einvolve concrete affective relations between two distinct though connected beings\u201f \n(Shaw, 2004, 60), beings who are materially connected in a position of self-preservation.  \nBreastfeeding therefore has the potential to be a highly evocative metaphor for relationships \nacross difference, particularly insofar as it can recognise the agency of both the mother and \nthe child. As Angiers (1999, 147) states: \u201eThe suckling of the baby is crucial to the \nproductivity of the mammary gland. The mammary gland will not continue making milk \nunless the mechanical sensation of suckling tells it that lactogenesis is necessary.\u201f Indeed, the \nidea that \u201ebabies have the ability to think, feel and ultimately modify the world they live in\u201f \n(Wayland, 2004, 279) is often ignored, although clearly babies can refuse the breast, can \ndemand and act in ways that force a negotiation by the mother. Pregnancy is intimately linked \nto lactation in this general sense: the placenta and the mammary glands have much in \ncommon. According to Angiers (1999, 147) \u201eThey are specialists and they are temporary \nworkers. They are designed to nourish a baby. No other organs are so fleeting, so single-\nminded, as the placenta-mammary dyad.\u201f For Irigaray, the placenta marks \u201ea sort of \n 26 \nnegotiation between the mother\u201fs self and the other that is the embryo\u2026. On the contrary, \nthere has to be recognition of the other, of the non-self, by the mother, and therefore an initial \nreaction from her, in order for placental factors to be produced. The difference between the \n\u201eself\u201f and the other is, so to speak, continuously negotiated\u201f (Irigaray, 1993, 41).  This is an \nagentic negotiation that runs through flowing milk too.  Indeed, breastfeeding may be seen as \na point where the bodies of the mother and child, which are separated during childbirth, \n\u201emerge again, and repeatedly, for what may be many years\u201f (Giles, 2004, 303). However, the \ncolonial legacy surrounding the \u201emother country\u201f and the \u201esavage as child\u201f is particularly \nweighty (Noxolo, 2006): \u201egiving milk\u201f is too easily read as infantilization, and \u201etaking milk\u201f as \nexploitation.  And what if postcolonial geographers outside the UK neither demand nor \ndesire the \u201emilk\u201f that British academic geography has to give?  The specific terms of \nmutuality cannot be directed, they must be negotiated and re-negotiated continually, the \npolitics of these relationalities recognised. The materialities through which relationalities are \nformed and in which they are embedded too cannot be ignored. The concern of this article is \nthat British academic geography needs to develop a more responsible attitude to participate \nin a more equitable negotiation process \u2013 we are not yet ready for breastfeeding. \n In this section we therefore employ the metaphor of lactation, rather than \nbreastfeeding, to re-imagine academic responsibility as a responsibility towards the self, \nwhere the self is seen as constituted in and through its relationships.  In an interview with \nPaul Gilroy (1993a), Morrison says that she based her novel Beloved on the famous true story \nof Margaret Garner, an African-American slave who escaped with her children, then killed \nthem rather than let the slave-catchers take them back into slavery, saying only: \u201eThey will \nnot live as I have done\u201f (cited in Gilroy, 1993a, 177). Morrison says of the incident: \n 27 \n\u201equestions about community and individuality were inherent in that incident as I imagined it.  \nWhen you are the community, when you are your children, when that is your individuality, \nthere is no division\u2026 It was for me this classic example of a person determined to be \nresponsible\u201f (Morrison, in Gilroy, 1993a, 177).  The novel can be read as an extended \nmeditation on the ineffable horror of human suffering (see Gilroy, 1993b, 218-223), but \ncrucially it is primarily a creative and fearless study of the absolute necessity of \nresponsibility in the constitution of human identity.  Lactation therefore works in the novel as \na graphic expression of this fluid-bordered self that is constituted through responsibility, and \nit is this vision of the lactating body that we use here as a metaphor for British academic \ngeography. \n In the novel, Sethe is an African-American woman in the period just after the \nabolition of slavery, who has experienced pregnancy and motherhood under slavery, in \nconditions of almost unimaginable, almost literally sublime (Spivak, 1992), hardship.  In the \nfollowing extract she talks with Paul D, who was also enslaved, about a time when she was \npregnant (with a child called Denver), but was also lactating for another child (the \neponymous Beloved). Planning to escape with her whole family, she had sent Beloved ahead \nof her to safety, and was planning to follow the child once she had found her husband: \n \u201eI had milk,\u201f she said.  \u201eI was pregnant with Denver but I had milk for my baby girl.  I \nhadn\u201ft stopped nursing her when I sent her on ahead with Howard and Buglar.\u201f   \nNow she rolled the dough out with a wooden pin.  \u201eAnybody could smell me long before he \nsaw me.  And when he saw me he\u201fd see the drops of it on the front of my dress.  Nothing I \ncould do about that.  All I knew was I had to get my milk to my baby girl.  Nobody was \ngoing to nurse her like me.  Nobody was going to get it to her fast enough, or take it away \n 28 \nwhen she had enough and didn\u201ft know it.  Nobody knew that she couldn\u201ft pass her air if you \nheld her up on your shoulder, only if she was lying on my knees.  Nobody knew that but me \nand nobody had her milk but me.  I told that to the women in the wagon.  Told them to put \nsugar water in cloth to suck from so when I got there in a few days she wouldn\u201ft have forgot \nme.  The milk would be there and I would be there with it.\u201f \n\u201eMen don\u201ft know nothing much,\u201f said Paul D, tucking his pouch back into his vest pocket, \n\u201ebut they do know a suckling can\u201ft be away from its mother for long.\u201f \n\u201eThen they know what it\u201fs like to send your children off when your breasts are full.\u201f \n\u201eWe was talking about a tree, Sethe.\u201f \n\u201eAfter I left you, those boys came in there and took my milk.  That\u201fs what they came in there \nfor.  Held me down and took it. I told Mrs Garner on em.  She had that lump and couldn\u201ft \nspeak but her eyes rolled out tears. Them boys found out I told on em.  Schoolteacher made \none open up my back, and when it closed it made a tree.   It grows there still.\u201f \n\u201eThey used cowhide on you?\u201f \n\u201eAnd they took my milk.\u201f \n\u201eThey beat you and you was pregnant?\u201f \n\u201eAnd they took my milk!\u201f \n(Morrison, 1987, 16-17) \n In the extract, Sethe describes an experience that, as someone who has been enslaved, \nPaul D can relate to.  However, she describes an experience that as a man, Paul D cannot \nexperience. The text subtly plays out this identity and difference \u2013 Paul D (probably unlike \nthe reader) immediately understands the meaning of the phrase \u201eopen up my back\u201f (and \nclarifies it for the reader), but the final four lines show the gap in understanding as Paul D \n 29 \ncannot get his mind off the beating of her as a pregnant woman, whilst Sethe tries to make \nhim understand the equal importance, the comparable violation, of the taking of her milk, the \ntreasure that her body was producing for her child. The tree on Sethe\u201fs back is a material \nwitness to the cowhide\u201fs cut, and Paul D can see the lack of respect for pregnancy to which it \nbears witness, but Sethe tries to make him see that it also, crucially, witnesses to the stolen \nmilk, to the fact that her pregnant body was also a lactating body, to the relationship through \nwhich that lactating body was produced \u2013 most hurtful to her is their exploitation of her \nbody\u201fs responsible agency in relation to her child.  \n Again this extract can be interpreted on two levels, the experiential and the \nmetaphorical, and both are relevant to British academic geography.  On an experiential level, \none of the most important contributions of this piece is the emotion that breathes through it \u2013 \nliterary writing is able to speak of emotion in ways that academic writing can often find \nimpossible. Recently geographers have tried to understand emotional geographies (see \nBennett, 2004; McCormack, 2003; Sylvester, 2006), arguing that the materiality of suffering, \nand therefore the necessity for change, cannot be fully understood without deploying \nemotional language in our academic work. This extract offers an imaginative way in to the \nemotional intensity and materiality of the experience of enslaved people, alerting us by its \nvisceral power to the fact that academics still have not adequately developed a language to \neither \u201elisten to or speak for\u201f the subjectivity of others (Spivak, 1988, 295). By extension from \nSpivak\u201fs (1992) work on language and the \u201epolitics of translation\u201f, it can be said that \ngeography has developed a way of writing a particular script around the body, which makes the \npain of physical exploitation not only inexpressible, but also unknowable. What we are left \nwith is a \u201emuting\u201f of subjects created in and through physical exploitation \u2013 researchers cannot \n 30 \n\u201elisten to\u201f the pain of the exploited body nor can bodily pain be produced as academic \nknowledge (except using \u201esilent\u201f statistical tools like morbidity rates).   \n Under colonialism, by highlighting and constructing physical difference, geographers \nhave been instrumental in \u201enaturalising\u201f the physical exploitation of black rather than white \nbodies in tropical climates, as well as the physical exploitation of working class rather than \nupper class bodies in the metropolis (Bell et al, 1995; Livingstone, 1994; McClintock, 1995).  \nIn particular, under slavery, the black female body was heavy with racial and sexual \nexploitation, a site of multiple and intense forms of material exploitation - labour, rape, \nreproduction.  Black feminist geographers have contributed to a trenchant interdisciplinary \ncritique of the underpinning abuses of the black female body as a representational site \n(McKittrick, 2006; see also hooks, 1992). Geographers more generally have recently tried to \nunderstand bodies as material, including emotional and performative geographies, as a way of \nbreaking down the privileging of text over body (Davidson et al, 2005; Gregson and Rose, \n2000; Thrift and Dewsbury, 2000).   \n In this context of geographical work on the materiality of bodily experience, \nMorrison\u201fs work throws out a distinctly geographical challenge in the shape of the tree on \nSethe\u201fs back: how can geographers respond to the material space of the dead scar tissue that \n\u201egrows there still\u201f?  In other words, it is the responsibility of geographers to find a way both to \nlocate the specific materiality of the scarred, exhausted, raped and murdered body of the \nenslaved person and to map that same materiality of pain and suffering still growing on the \nbodies of human beings on a global scale today.    \n At a metaphorical level, it is the materiality of lactation as it is used in this extract from \nBeloved that makes the image \u201egeography\u201fs milk is flowing\u201f so evocative.  Made all the more \n 31 \npoignant by the fact that she is separated from her child, by the fact that her enslaved status \nallows other people to take her milk from her, by the sight and smell of the milk itself, a large \npart of the power of the image is that Sethe\u201fs milk flows \u2013 there is nothing she can do about it.  \nHer body has its own agency, and it is an agency based on relationship.  What Morrison \ndescribes in this image of lactation is an interconnected materiality that \u201echallenges the \ninvisibility of intercorporeal existence and identity [confirming]\u2026that one\u201fs identity is \nformed and immersed in the lived bodies of others\u201f identities\u201f (Shaw, 2004, 287).  The \nrelationship between self and other does not have to be established - in fact it cannot be \ndenied.  It is in place. Beyond this, however, what makes Sethe responsible rather than tragic \nis her determination to resist disintegration.  She harnesses her will to her body and refuses to \nlet them be torn asunder.  The boys stealing her milk is a powerful image of the huge \nconstraint that she has to overcome to keep body and will together \u2013 a transatlantic slave \nsystem that seeks to possess everything that she has or will ever produce.  Utterly single-\nminded, all she knows is that the milk will be there, with her child, and she will be there with \nit\n5\n.   \n This is a powerful metaphor for the responsibility and relationality of British \nacademic geography.  The question of responsibility and relationality between places, and \nbetween place and space, have always been central for geographers - they are part of the \ndiscipline\u201fs redefinition of itself, and are also key questions for postcolonial theory. For \ninstance, development geographers have spelt out some of the theoretical bases for \n                                                 \n5\n Later in the novel (Morrison, 1987, 152), this powerful image is mirrored by another, as \nDenver sucks her mother\u201fs milk through the blood of her sister \u2013 it has soaked onto \nSethe\u201fs breast as she killed her own baby to escape the slave catchers. The interconnected \nsubjectivity that is the essence of responsibility is once again delineated in this potent \nimage. \n 32 \nresponding to \u201ethe claims of distant strangers\u201f (Corbridge, 1993) and arguing that \nresponsibility for global poverty is spread far beyond the people who feel its weight (see \nEchanove, 2005). Doreen Massey (2004) makes this responsibility clear when she suggests \nthat global cities like London need to take responsibility for the exploitation that now brings, \nand historically has brought them, the resources to establish and maintain their status.  She \ntherefore argues for the need to recognise \u201ehow those small and highly differentiated bits of \nall of us which position us as \u201eLondoners\u201f give rise to responsibility towards the wider \nrelations on which we depend\u201f (Massey, 2004, 17).   \n This relationality extends to academic practices too, requiring us as academics to take \nactive steps to recognise the relationships between British academic geography and its \npostcolonial publics. Jenny Robinson (2003) helpfully outlines some of these steps when she \nargues for the need to acknowledge the locatedness of our theories, to demarginalise \ndevelopment geography, to engage with regional scholarship, and to transform the conditions \nof production and circulation of knowledge to remove the barriers to international publishing \nthat now lie before many scholars in other countries.  Similarly, Derek Gregory (2005,186-8) \nsuggests a range of \u201ecounter geographies\u201f that can work to emphasise postcolonial \nconnection, counteracting colonial and neo-colonial distancing strategies: contextual \ngeographies that reveal the material realities of other people\u201fs lives; contrapuntal geographies \nthat highlight global connections and relationships; cosmopolitan geographies that emphasise \ncommonalities; and collaborative geographies in which partnerships are formed between \nacademics in different countries. \n These important strategies might all be characterised broadly as locating British \nacademic geography \u2013 undermining the colonial dynamic that takes its authority by speaking \n 33 \n\u201efrom nowhere\u201f (Duncan, 1996, 2) in order to play a more equitable role in the world, \nacknowledging interdependence.  Location however, is not necessarily a sufficient basis for \nresponsibility - as Alistair Bonnett (2003, 59) suggests, location is just as likely to be a \nprelude to isolationism and elitism, \u201ea turn away from the international and global and \ntowards \u201cthe West\u201d\u2026 as the natural province of British geography.\u201f The metaphor of \nlactation, as set out in Beloved, allows us not only to locate the discipline but to re-locate it, \nby embodying it in a form whose boundaries are fluid, a form that is defined by relationality.  \nThe discipline therefore has no \u201enatural province\u201f that is bounded and separate from \nelsewhere.  It is defined by its relationships, not by its boundaries.  In our concluding section \nwe will set out a range of tactics suggested by postcolonial literary theorists to work with \nthese fluid boundaries between self and other. \n Doreen Massey says with regard to relationships between places: \u201eWe are responsible \nto areas beyond the bounds of place not because of what we have done, but because of what \nwe are\u201f (Massey, 2004, 16).  It is this form of relational responsibility that using the \nmetaphor of \u201eflowing milk\u201f can envisage, an attempt to get past the sometimes ineffective \n(though entirely just) argument that British geography is responsible to its global \nconstituency because of the many injustices that Britain has meted out.  Instead, following \nSethe, we move towards a position that we harness our will to our bodies \u2013 we take \nresponsibility precisely because those relationships constitute what British geography is. We \nalso suggest the many other relationalities - such as those between mother and child and \nteacher and student - that forms as well as interrupts postcolonial responsibilities of \nGeography. It suggests the multiple forms of power (gender, generational, postcolonial) and \nthe multitude of subjectivities through which these responsibilities are formed, shaped and \n 34 \nenacted through. And these responsibilities are in place \u2013 to deny them leads to \ndisintegration.  And, as we saw in the previous section in relation to Toycie, disintegration \nbrings a tragic loss of identity.  \n \nConclusion: going with the flow \nIn this paper we have experimented with the metaphors of pregnancy and lactation to \nunsettle the geographical imagination in order to contribute to debates about British academic \ngeography\u201fs postcolonial position in a very materially grounded manner. Our argument has \nbeen two-fold. First, the postcolonial relationship is already in place: the postcolonial is \nconstitutive of British geography and has made it what it is today. This point was highlighted \nthrough an extract from Zee Edgell\u201fs (1982) novel, Beka Lamb, which exposed the ultimately \ndestructive fragmentation that denial of this relationality can bring. Second, we have argued \nthat this postcolonial relationship constitutes British geography so therefore \nacknowledgement of it is a responsibility that geography owes to itself.  Through an extract \nfrom Toni Morrison\u201fs (1987) Beloved, we use the metaphor of lactation as a way of insisting \non the responsibility that this relationality in place engenders. In making these arguments we \nhave attempted to unsettle the growing literature on geography which seek to locate \npostcoloniality \u201eelsewhere\u201f. In the conclusion we suggest some strategies towards this re-\nlocation. \n By using the metaphors \u201egeography is pregnant\u201f and \u201egeography\u201fs milk is flowing\u201f, \nwe have made a double move. Along with writers like Bonnett (2003), Robinson (2003) and \nGregory (2005), we have \u201elocated\u201f British academic geography as a body.  That is to say, we \nhave specified that the discipline takes a particular form in its particular place, and cannot \n 35 \nwrite as if from the centre, or from nowhere.  But we have also re-located geography as what \nmight be termed a \u201eheterotopic\u201f body, that is to say, a body whose boundaries are fluid, \nwhich is situated in one place and yet fundamentally only takes place through its \nrelationships with other places. Re-located in this way, we emphasise the connections \nbetween British academic geography and the rest of the world, its multivocality, engendering \na responsibility to the world that flows directly from what the discipline is, rather than what it \nmight like to be. \n However, there is another sense in which British academic geography is heterotopic.  \nMichel Foucault (1984) develops the notion of the \u201eheterotopia\u201f as a space that functions like \nthe space we see inside a mirror, i.e. as a space that makes intersubjective positions more \n\u201ereal\u201f (by displaying the connections between the person looking into the mirror and the \nspace and places around them), but simultaneously as a space that makes everybody\u201fs \npositions more \u201eunreal\u201f by re-constructing them within a virtual back-to-front world.  \nSimilarly, as we re-locate the discipline in terms of relationality, it is important to recognise \nthis dual capacity of geography \u2013 the discipline increasingly theorises the world in terms of \nflows and connections, but can also falsify relationships if we are unable to recognise absolute \ndifference, incommensurability. Geographical work is therefore forced to acknowledge \nabruptness and separation as well as connections and flows suggesting that there are limits too \nin thinking relationally. Relationality must at all times be interrogated, not uncritically \nassumed. \n By this token, British academic geography is a discipline that is both a part of and apart \nfrom its global and popular counterparts. Hence, although there is no simple and intellectually \nunproblematic way of distinguishing different geographical traditions, there are still spaces \n 36 \nand forms of geographical knowledge in different parts of the world that are not entirely \ndetermined through their relations with each other (Mufti, 2005). Geography as a \npostcolonial discipline has always therefore to recognise the mutual constitution of different \ngeographical theories\/knowledges and the importance of each for the other\u201fs formations, \nalongside theories\/knowledges that are not entirely constituted through this relation. Being a \npart of, but still being apart from, therefore entails responsibilities to both take account of, \nbut also be accountable to, both the connections and the disconnections, these different \nspaces and their distinctive world picturing.  \n We end then with three tactics from postcolonial literary theorists for working with \nthis problematised relationality: reading as a writer (Morrison, 1993); reading as translation \n(Spivak, 1992); and \u201egoing a piece of the way\u201f with a text (Boyce Davies, 1994).  All are \nabout uncovering and transcending the silencing of multivocality that happens within \nmainstream texts.  But each can be redeployed by postcolonial geographers to throw out a \nrange of challenges to our perspectives; research, teaching and administration; relationships \nwith colleagues, students and research assistants; and our national\/transnational work within \nthe university, in \u201ethe field\u201f, and at conferences.  \n Morrison\u201fs (1993) narrative of the way she learned to read the racialisation of \ndominant US literary texts is instructive. She notices that even when there are black \ncharacters in these texts their presences: \u201ecould never be about anything other than the \n\u201cnormal\u201d, unracialized, illusory white world that provided the fictional backdrop\u201f (Morrison, \n1993, 16).  It seems that there is little to go on.  It is only when she begins to read, not as a \nreader, but as a writer that she realises that the racialisation of these texts is not in the scarcity \nof the black characters but in the purposes which these characters serve within the texts: \n 37 \n\u201eI began to rely on my knowledge of how books get written, how language arrives; my \nsense of how and why writers abandon or take on certain aspects of their project.  I began \nto rely on my understanding of what the linguistic struggle requires of writers and what \nthey make of the surprise that is the inevitable concomitant of the act of creation.  What \nbecame transparent were the self-evident ways that Americans choose to talk about \nthemselves through and within a sometimes allegorical, sometimes metaphorical, but \nalways choked representation of an Africanist presence\u201f (Morrison, 1993, 17).  \nThis article, along with Morrison\u201fs tactic of reading as a writer, suggests a need to remain \nopen to the possibilities (and problems) posed by the bodies that we do not yet see or \nrecognise within the discipline and its physical and textual landscapes. How might \nrecognition of such bodies uncover the multiplicity of postcolonial relationships, the different \nmeanings of those relationships in different places and spaces and how such relationships are \nall imbued with multiple modalities of power? And what metaphors might these bodies call \nforth? And might those metaphors offer one way to broaden out from medicalisation in the \nmapping of material corporeal suffering and pain towards challenging the structures that \nproduce such injustices? \n Spivak (1992) speaks of \u201ereading as translation\u201f, in which she suggests that the \npostcolonial writer needs to take a stance which is: \u201eprecisely not a surrender but a friendly \nlearning by taking a distance\u201f (Spivak, 1992, 196).  This involves reading the mainstream \ntext with a recognition that, though it may be aimed at a white male readership, there are \nsome aspects that the writer may only hint at as marginal to the text, but that are central to the \npreoccupations of those who do not read from a mainstream position.  The postcolonial \nreader has to read with an attitude which is open to these opportunities for gleaning.  Spivak \n 38 \nalso, however, notes the limits of literacy, the points at which the marginal reader may \nchoose not to read on, because she is so completely excluded from the text.  At these points \nthe postcolonial reader \u201esnuffles off, disgruntled\u201f (Spivak, 1992, 197), and supplements her \nreading with more inclusive texts.  \nSpivak\u201fs tactic of reading as translation suggests a need to interrogate our research \nrelationships for their multivocality.  How can moneyed institutions and individuals in the \nwest create a heightened demand for a wider range of publications from a wider range of \ninternational writers? How can our writing be aimed at or re-constructed for a broader range \nof audiences, and how can we listen for the range of responses that they might make?  How \ncan we glean from any localised research that we carry out a map of international flows and \nruptures that ripples out from it? And how can we recognise what interrupts, constrains and \nstops those flows to make apparent how political and economic structures and practices of \nneo-liberal economies might be changed to promote more equalised international relations? \n Finally, Boyce Davies (1994), in an article which is concerned with the relation \nbetween black writers and mainstream academic theories, advocates reading dominant texts \nfrom a position of \u201ecritical relationality\u201f, \u201egoing a piece of the way with them\u201f (Boyce \nDavies, 1994, 46).  This is based on the practice, which she locates within African-based \nhabits of hospitality, of accompanying a friend or visitor on part of their journey home.  She \ndoes not advocate \u201egoing all the way home\u201f with mainstream texts, because this: \u201einevitably \nplaces me in the \u201ehomes\u201f of people where I, as a Black woman, will have to function either as \nmaid or exotic, silenced courtesan, definitely not as a theoretical equal\u201f (Boyce Davies, 1994, \n46).  However, by going part of the way one has the opportunity to engage in conversation, to \n 39 \ninterrogate the texts and critique that which is exclusionary as well as benefiting from that \nwhich could be inclusive.  \nBoyce Davies\u201fs tactic of \u201ecritical relationality\u201f suggests a need to interrogate our \npedagogic relationships for their inclusivity. How can we develop more inclusive curricula in \nour teaching, engaging more closely with the experiences of international students for \nexample? What broader types of collaborative work can be carried out with overseas \ninstitutions to develop shared or complementary curricula on global issues?   How can we \nengage critically with international students and colleagues without imposing a \u201eview from \nthe centre\u201f? What can national and international funding bodies and Higher Educational \ninstitutions do to encourage and support such critical, sustained engagement? And at what \npoint do we turn around and go home, recognising the abruptions that limit relationality and \nshake up responsibility? \n In using metaphors of pregnancy and lactation we are labouring towards a \nresponsibility in which the global injustices upon which British academic geography is \nfounded and maintained are not seen as an individualistic paternalist ethics but one that \nresults from the contributions of millions of people and numerous institutions to the \nintellectual and institutional structures that make the discipline what it is\n6\n. It is a \nresponsibility that brings into question the normalcy of historical and contemporary unjust \ngeopolitical conditions that underpin academic imperialism (Ake, 1979). It is a responsibility \nthat is cognisant of its debts but also looks forwards for results, for steps that will change the \nprocesses that result in the production of unjust global structures (cf Young, 2003). And \nfinally it is a shared responsibility, involving all individuals, those who suffer injustices and \n                                                 \n6\n See Young 2003 for a more extended discussion of such a responsibility. \n 40 \nthose who benefit from them, having agency to recognise that we are all connected to \nstructural processes that produce injustice. However, we are not all equally positioned in \nthese efforts and our responsibilities are therefore not equal, not even equivalent. Meeting \nthese responsibilities will not be easy but ultimately it could give birth to and nurture a more \ngenuinely postcolonial geographical discipline. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank the three anonymous referees for their useful and thought-provoking \ncomments.
