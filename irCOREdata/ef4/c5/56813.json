The source of this organic N is \nunknown, but generally assumed to come from canopy processing of wet or dry \ndeposited inorganic N. There have been very few experimental studies in the field to \naddress the canopy formation or loss of organic N. We report two studies: a Scots \npine canopy exposed to ammonia gas, and a Sitka spruce canopy exposed to \nammonium  and nitrate as wet deposition. In both cases, organic N deposition in \nthroughfall was increased, but only represented a small fraction (<10%) of the \nadditional inorganic N supplied, suggesting a limited capacity for net organic N \nproduction, similar in both conifer canopies under Scottish summertime conditions, of \nless than 1.6 mmol N m\n-2\n mth\n-1\n (equivalent to 3 kg N ha\n-1\ny\n-1\n). \n \nKeywords \nOrganic nitrogen; wet deposition; dry deposition; throughfall; nitrogen budget. \n \nCapsule \nExperimental addition of inorganic N to conifer canopies shows limited production of \norganic N in throughfall \n \nIntroduction \nNitrogen compounds, deposited from the atmosphere to vegetation as gases and \nparticles, or in precipitation, interact with plant surfaces before reaching the soil. \nAlthough some N is retained by vegetation, and only reaches the soil when the plant \ndies or sheds its leaves, most passes through the canopy fairly quickly and enters the \nsoil as throughfall (TF = canopy drip) or stem flow (SF = water running down tree \nstems). Canopy uptake or retention of inorganic N (ammonium or nitrate) and organic \nN has long been recognised as an important fate for N in forests, where it is relatively \nsimple to measure TF and SF for comparison with wet deposition, although its \ndependence on dry deposition is less easily established (Parker, 1983, Schaefer and \nReiners, 1990, Tukey, 1970). It is not clear, however, what happens to the N that is \nretained in the canopy. Potential fates include: uptake by leaves or stems followed by \nuse as nutrient N (Raven, 1988, Rennenberg and Gessler, 1999); uptake and use by \nepiphytic organisms (Endres and Mercier, 2001, Knops et al., 1996, Leith et al., \n2008); chemical retention in or on bark (Dail et al., 2009); volatilisation as surface \nwater evaporates; and chemical or biological transformation of inorganic N to organic \nN, followed by deposition in TF or SF (Ferm, 1993, Zimmermann et al., 2007). \n 2 \nAlthough the chemical composition of organic N in TF is rarely characterised, one \nstudy has shown a significant contribution (17%) of amino acids (Forsum et al., \n2006), and the chemical composition is likely to affect the subsequent fate of organic \nN in soil (Michalzik and Matzner, 1999, M\u00f6ller et al., 2005, Qualls and Haines, \n1991a, 1991b). Organic N may also have canopy sources similar to those that lead to \nincreases in dissolved organic matter (DOM) in TF compared to precipitation, such as \ninsect frass, leaf exudates, leaf damage or dry deposition of water-soluble organic \ncompounds from the atmosphere. For example, large changes in DOM have been \nmeasured in TF in response to aphid infestations at the Deepsyke site described below \n(Stadler et al., 2001). \n \nSeveral analytical techniques have been used to measure organic N in TF and \nprecipitation; the variety of chemical techniques used historically for measuring \u2018total \nsoluble N\u2019 has led to some debate as to the comparability of different studies (Cornell \net al., 2003). However, the sampling of wet-only or bulk precipitation for inorganic N, \nand the range of sampling methods for TF and SF, also introduce quantitative \nuncertainties into the values of inorganic N reported, whether through the contribution \nof dry-deposited material on the collectors (Gonz\u00e1lez Ben\u00edtez et al., 2009), or losses \nof material through biological or chemical activity in the sample in the field prior to \ncollection and preservation by cooling, freezing or addition of biocide (Cape et al., \n2001b, Michalzik et al., 1997). Consequently, the estimation of \u2018organic N\u2019 as the \ndifference between \u2018total N\u2019 and the sum of the inorganic ions (ammonium and \nnitrate) is inevitably less precise than for many other constituents of wet deposition. \nThese variations may lead to differences in interpretation, and quantitative \nunderstanding of the processes involved may be difficult. This approach also only \nincludes water-soluble organic N; there may also be particulate organic N removed \nfrom canopies in TF which is not included in measurements of \u2018water-soluble\u2019 \norganic N. However, in practice, the \u2018water-soluble\u2019 fraction is effectively defined by \nthe size and type of filter used prior to chemical analysis, and this is not always \nreported. \n \nIn many cases, the overall deposition of N measured in TF and SF exceeds that \nmeasured in wet deposition, i.e. \u2018net throughfall\u2019 (NTF) = TF + SF \u2013 wet deposition, \nis positive. In a meta-analysis of data up to 1983, the average ratio of deposition in TF \nto wet deposition was 1.6 (\u00b1 1.3) for NH4\n+\n, 1.3 (\u00b1 0.9) for NO3\n-\n and 1.9 (\u00b1 1.5) for \ntotal N (including organic N) (Parker, 1983)  The increase in overall N deposition \nbelow the canopy relative to wet deposition is most probably caused by dry deposition \nof N on the canopy, which is not measured (over annual time scales) but may be \nestimated using measured or modelled air concentrations and an appropriate \ninferential model (Butler and Likens, 1995). In such cases the measured increase in N \ndeposition in NTF (i.e. measured deposition below canopy, less wet deposition above \ncanopy) gives a lower bound to the dry deposition on the canopy. The assumption is \nthat most plant canopies are not sources of N, i.e. that vegetation conserves N and that \nthis is therefore unlikely to be removed from a canopy by leaching or ion exchange.  \n 3 \n \nOrganic nitrogen in throughfall \nAlthough many studies report changes (usually increases) in organic N concentrations \nin TF compared with incident precipitation, not all report the relevant fluxes, so that \nnet uptake of inorganic or organic N cannot be estimated. A review of temperate \nforests showed a range of dissolved organic N (DON) in bulk precipitation in the \nrange 1-4 kg N ha\n-1\n y\n-1\n, with the associated DON fluxes in TF in the range 1-12 kg N \nha\n-1\n y\n-1\n (Michalzik et al., 2001). Where studies have reported fluxes, deposition of \norganic N in TF can sometimes be less than in precipitation, implying net uptake or \nretention of organic N in the canopy. Some studies that provide flux data (as opposed \nto simply concentrations) are summarised in Table 1. This is a relatively small subset \nof all the data on N deposition above and below forest canopies, but in most such \nstudies no measurements have been made of the organic N content and deposition of \nboth incident precipitation and throughfall.  \n \nTABLE 1 near here \n \nThere have been few experiments in which canopy transformations of deposited N, \nincluding organic N, have been studied through experimental manipulation. Changing \nthe nutrient status of trees can change canopy processes. For example, a soil fertilizer \ntreatment (with and without irrigation) of Pinus radiata in Australia showed net \nuptake of NH4\n+\n and release of organic N in TF from the control trees, but release of \nNH4\n+\n and increased release of NO3\n- \nand organic N in TF from fertilized trees, with the \nsize of the effect being magnified in the irrigated treatment (Crockford and Khanna, \n1997). Although it is possible that the additional N measured in TF was cycled from \nthe roots through the canopy, it is more likely that the higher N status of the canopy \nled to lower retention of wet-deposited N.  Direct manipulations of forest canopies, as \nopposed to the soil, are even rarer. One recent study, using helicopter addition of \nNH4NO3 to a mature conifer forest canopy (Gaige et al., 2007) showed conversion of \nboth NH4\n+\n and NO3\n-\n to organic N in throughfall, by the use of \n15\nN isotopic labelling, \nin a forest where organic N made up 80% of the total N below canopy in untreated \nareas (i.e. where canopy transformation processes were apparently very active). \nConversion of the treatment-applied inorganic N was rapid, and essentially complete \nwithin a few days of the application to the canopy.  \n \nWe present here data from two large-scale field experiments where, as part of the \nmain experiment, measurements were made of both inorganic and total N in \nprecipitation, treatments and TF. The objective was to estimate the extent to which \ncanopy additions of inorganic N lead to net formation of organic N in TF under the \nclimatic and growing conditions of the trees in the experiments. In the first \nexperiment, trees were exposed to additional ammonia gas; in the second, several \ndifferent N-containing solutions were applied to the canopy. \n \n 4 \nExperimental methods \nAmmonia fumigation \u2013 AMBER experiment \nThe AMBER experiment (Ammonia Mitigation By Enhanced Recapture) was \ndesigned to study the use of woodland planting around agricultural point sources of \nammonia, such as intensive livestock units, to trap emissions close to source and \nprevent transport away from the farm (Theobald et al., 2001). A schematic diagram of \nthe experiment is shown in Figure 1. The site was located in south-east Scotland (lat. \n55\no42\u2019 N, long. 3o21\u2019 W, elevation 250 m). Ammonia gas was released into a 40 m \nlong ventilated manifold using a mass-flow controller from a cylinder of pure NH 3 \n(BOC Ltd.) when the prevailing south-westerly wind was blowing towards a shelter \nbelt of trees (mostly mature Scots pine, about 12 m high, with a closed canopy and \nLAI estimated as 2 (Theobald, 2004)). Ammonia gas concentrations and TF \ndeposition were measured across the 60 m wide woodland. Measurements started in \nautumn 2000 for one year. The data presented here are from summer (1 May - 13 \nSeptember) 2001, and from TF samplers between 20 and 25 m from the edge of the \nwoodland, which were most directly comparable in terms of canopy and exposure to \nthe TF \u2018control\u2019 plots (see below). \n \nRain and TF samples were preserved in the field using thymol (2-isopropyl-5-\nmethylphenol), to prevent microbial degradation during and after collection (Ayers et \nal., 1998, Cape et al., 2001b, Hadi and Cape, 1995), and were collected approximately \nweekly, depending on rainfall amounts. Rain was sampled (in triplicate) using 20 cm \ndiameter polyethylene funnels mounted 1.5 m above ground, draining to black \npolyethylene bottles. Throughfall was sampled using gutters mounted above the \nground vegetation at fixed distances from the woodland edge, draining to black \npolyethylene bottles containing thymol. \u2018Control\u2019 TF gutters were placed to the north-\nwest of the main experiment, away from the influence of the ammonia source. \nAmmonia gas concentrations were measured upwind, and within the woodland, using \npassive samplers of ALPHA design (Tang et al., 2001) at 1.5 m above ground, with \noccasional measurements of the vertical profile from the ground to above the canopy \nusing a continuous wet annular denuder (Theobald et al., 2001). \n \nFIGURE 1 near here \n \nCanopy treatment with simulated rainfall \u2013 Deepsyke forest \nThis major field experiment was designed to study the effects of nitrogen and sulphur-\ncontaining pollutants in wet deposition on a plantation forest (planted 1986, at 2m \nspacing) of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr). The forest (Deepsyke) is in \nsouthern Scotland in an area remote from gaseous pollutants and with relatively low \nlevels of N deposition (8-10 kg N ha\n-1\n y\n-1\n), lat. 55\no\n46\u2019N, long. 3o17\u2019W, elevation 290 \nm. Four replicate blocks, each containing 10 trees, were established for each of 6 \ndifferent experimental treatments. A canopy spraying system was built around each \nexperimental block, to deliver the treatment solutions, which were made up on site \nfrom concentrated solutions using collected rainwater, and sprayed onto the canopy \n 5 \nfrom above on average 6 times weekly, at a rate of 2 mm rain equivalent per \napplication. At the time of the measurements presented below (summer 2001), the \ntrees had closed canopy, were ca. 7 m high with an average stem basal area of ca. \n0.015 m\n2\n, and with an estimated leaf area index up to 10 m\n2\n m\n-2\n. The canopy density \nwas markedly smaller in response to treatments containing H2SO4, which caused a \ndoubling of litter fall, but with no significant effect on tree growth (Sheppard et al., \n2001).  The trees had been receiving the treatments (A-F) shown in Table 2 for the \nprevious 5 years. In 2001 the treatment regime was modified, with different numbers \nof replicated blocks receiving the same 6 treatments. Spraying was carried out early in \nthe morning on days when conditions were calm with minimal sunshine. Further \ndetails of the experiment have been published elsewhere (Sheppard and Crossley, \n2000, Sheppard et al., 2004). \n \nTABLE 2 near here \n \nRain was sampled within a clearing in the forest using three collectors, each \ncomprising a 20cm diameter polyethylene funnel mounted 1.5m from the ground \nattached to a five litre black polyethylene bottle. A small quantity (ca. 5 g) of thymol \nwas added prior to collection to suppress any microbial action during and after \ncollection. Filtered (0.45 m, cellulose nitrate membrane) sub-samples were stored \nprior to analysis in polyethylene bottles at < 5\u00b0C. \n   \nEach of the 24 experimental plots contained a linked framework of guttering with an \noverall area of 1 m\n2\n. The guttering was arranged to give the steepest permissible \nincline, thereby reducing the TF residence time and minimising compositional \nchanges. It was arranged in a \u2018herring bone\u2019 structure drawing TF from the whole plot \ninto a central collecting vessel. A small permeable container with ca. 5 g solid thymol \nbiocide was added to the collecting tanks at the start of each TF sampling period. \nSamples were collected twice monthly through the course of the summer and stored \n(after filtration through 0.45 m membrane) in a cold room (< 5 \u00b0C) whilst awaiting \nanalysis. Results from measurements of rain and TF chemistry in 1999 and 2000 \nshowed retention by the canopy of 20-40% of the additional applied N (Cape et al., \n2001a, Chiwa et al., 2004). In 2001, the continuing measurements of rain and TF \nchemistry were used to investigate the fate of organic N.  \n \nBecause of retention and exchange of N in the canopy, a quantitative budget can only \nbe calculated if the amount of material applied to the canopy is accurately known. \nVariation in spray application, and spray drift, led to smaller amounts of deposition \nthan calculated simply on the basis of the known concentration and amounts applied \nduring treatments. Consequently, the sulphate and sodium ions in TF were used as \nconservative tracers of deposition. In the \u2018single dose\u2019 treatments the average \ndeposition of sulphate and sodium ions in TF was 75% of the total amounts applied; \nfor the \u2018double dose\u2019 treatment the fraction of the applied spray treatment recovered in \n 6 \nTF was 60%. These \u2018capture efficiencies\u2019 have been used to calculate the amounts of \nN actually applied to the canopy in the different treatments. The data presented here \nare the summed deposition values for the period 17 May to 14 August 2001. During \nthis period the rainfall was 334 \u00b1 3 mm (mean and standard deviation of 3 collectors). \nInput of N in rainfall was 8.2 \u00b1 0.8 mmol NH4-N m\n-2\n, 6.9 \u00b1 0.2 mmol NO3-N m\n-2\n, and \n2 \u00b1 2 mmol organic N m\n-2\n.\n The \u2018background\u2019 treatments (E) contained additional 5 \n\u03bcM NH4NO3 + H2SO4 (Table 2) and provided (including incident rainfall) 8.7 \u00b1 0.8 \nmmol NH4-N m\n-2\n, 7.6 \u00b1 0.2 mmol NO3-N m\n-2\n, and 2 \u00b1 2 mmol organic N m\n-2\n;  the \nsmall additional organic N input came from the N content of the stored rain water \nused to make up the spray solution. Inputs of N in treatments A, C and D were 150 \u00b1 \n40 nmol N m\n-2\n, 250 \u00b1 50 nmol N m\n-2\n, and 160 \u00b1 1 nmol N m\n-2\n, respectively, where the \nuncertainties are standard deviations of the plot means within each treatment. \n \nFor both studies, total water-soluble N was analysed in triplicate using an \nANTEK8060 analyzer in flow injection mode. The carrier (water) and filtered (0.45 \n\u03bcm) sample was nebulised into a furnace at 1050 \u00b0C in an oxygen\/helium flow, where \nall nitrogen-containing solutes were converted quantitatively to nitric oxide (NO) \nwhich was then quantified by chemiluminescent reaction with ozone. Nitrate and \nammonium concentrations were determined by ion chromatography (Metrohm) of \nfiltered samples. Water-soluble organic N was calculated as the difference between \ntotal N and the sum of inorganic N (ammonium and nitrate). Analysis methods are \ndescribed in more detail elsewhere (Gonz\u00e1lez Ben\u00edtez et al., 2009). \n \nResults \nDry deposition of ammonia \u2013 AMBER experiment \nFigure 2 shows the deposition of inorganic and organic N in rainfall, in the \u2018control\u2019 \nTF, and in the TF from the centre of the treated woodland, averaged over the 2 sets of \nTF samplers between 20 and 25 m from the edge, for the 7 sample collections during \nthe period. The integrated deposition over the 18 weeks is shown in Figure 3. \nComparison of the \u2018control\u2019 TF data with the rainfall data shows that around 25% of \nthe total wet-deposited N was retained by the canopy (Figure 3). However, this \ncalculation does not include any contribution from dry deposited material. Although \nthere was only a small difference in NH4\n+\n deposited in rain and TF (Figure 2a), there \nwould have been significant deposition of NH3 gas even at the \u2018control\u2019 site, in the \nabsence of exposure to the fumigation treatment. Average background NH3 \nconcentrations upwind of the release point were 4 \u03bcg NH3 m\n-3\n, leading to an estimated \nadditional dry deposition of NH3 to the canopy of around 50 mmol N m\n-2\n over the \nperiod (based on an assumed deposition velocity of  0.02 m s\n-1\n to the woodland \ncanopy) , and implying retention of a similar amount in the canopy. Almost all the \nNO3\n-\n in rain was retained by the canopy (Figure 2b), and there was a small net \nincrease in organic N in TF compared with rain (Figure 2c). These results are similar \nto reported behaviour for other coniferous forests (see Table 1), in which there is often \na net increase in organic N in TF, and retention of inorganic N. \n \n 7 \nFIGURES 2 & 3 near here \n \nIn the fumigated plot, however, the total deposition in TF was dominated by NH4\n+\n, \nand even this is likely to be much less than the overall deposition of NH3 gas and \nNH4\n+\n in solution to the canopy. Dry deposition of NH3 was probably more than 100 \nmmol N m\n-2\n over the period, based on the NH3 concentrations measured below the \ncanopy during NH3 fumigations, which were around 45 \u03bcg NH3 m\n-3\n, and the \nobservation that concentrations above the canopy were around 20% of those measured \nbelow (Theobald et al., 2001). The capacity of the canopy to retain NH3 was \nexceeded, leading to a net increase in NH4\n+\n deposition in TF relative to the \u2018control\u2019 \nof 27 \u00b1 6 mmol m\n-2\n over the period (Figure 2a). The deposition of NO3\n-\n in TF (8 \u00b1 2 \nmmol m\n-2\n) was similar to that in rainfall (8.7 \u00b1 0.6 mmol m\n-2\n), and greater than in the \n\u2018control\u2019 plot (2.1 \u00b1 0.6 mmol m-2), implying no net retention of NO3\n- \nin the canopy, \nalthough there was some variability throughout the period (Figure 2b). This could be \ninterpreted either that NO3\n-\n was not retained because of the high availability of NH4\n+\n \nin the canopy, or because nitrification of NH4\n+\n to NO3\n- \nin the canopy matched the \nuptake of NO3\n-\n in the canopy. There was a large increase in deposition of organic N \ncompared to the \u2018control\u2019 TF (Figure 2c), but this was still equivalent to only around \n10% of the NH3 likely to have been retained in the canopy, although this estimate is \nvery uncertain. The net increase in organic N deposition in TF in the fumigated area \nover the period (11 \u00b1 1 mmol m\n-2\n cf. 4 \u00b1 2 mmol m\n-2\n in the \u2018control\u2019 area; P=0.01 for \ntwo-tailed paired t-test over 7 sample dates) is equivalent to a net formation rate in the \ncanopy of 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mmol m\n-2\n mth\n-1\n. \n \nAdditional wet deposition \u2013 Deepsyke experiment \nThe uptake\/release of water-soluble N from plots that received no (or small \nadditional) N in the spray treatment (rainfall, 17 mmol m\n-2\n; \u2018background\u2019, 18 mmol m-\n2\n) is shown in Figure 4. There was net uptake of both NH4\n+\n and of NO3\n-\n, and net \nproduction of organic N in the canopy, although not at a rate that balanced the uptake \nof inorganic N, so that there was a small net uptake of total N.  \n \nFIGURE 4 near here \n \nThe uptake\/release of water-soluble N from plots that received additional N in the \nspray treatment (NH4NO3 (D), 160 mmol m\n-2\n; NH4NO3+H2SO4, 150 (A) or 250 (C) \nmmol m\n-2\n) is shown in Figure 5. There was net uptake of NH4\n+\n from NH4NO3 \nsolution, but this was suppressed in the presence of H2SO4 (\u2018acid\u2019 at pH2.5: A, C) at \nboth treatment rates. Uptake of NO3\n-\n was enhanced by the presence of acidity \n(treatment A), but only increased slightly with the double dose acid treatment \n(treatment C). For both ions the net retention was only a small proportion (ca. 20% for \nA, D and 12% for C) of the additional N supplied to the canopy. There was net \nproduction of organic N in the canopy; over the period the total deposition in TF with \n\u2018single\u2019 N additions (A, D) was 8 \u00b1 2 mmol m-2 compared with 4.0 \u00b1 0.5 mmol m-2 in \nthe \u2018no spray\u2019 treatments (F), and 5 \u00b1 2 mmol m-2 in the \u2018background\u2019 treatment with \n 8 \nadded spray (E). The difference relative to the \u2018background\u2019 treatment equates to a net \nformation rate in the canopy of 1 \u00b1 3 mmol m\n-2\n mth\n-1\n. Although not statistically \nsignificant (paired t-test, n = 5) the net production in the N treatments was greater \nthan in the \u2018background\u2019 on 4 of the 5 sampling dates.   \n \nFIGURE 5 near here \n \nDiscussion  \nReview of previous data \nThe summary data in Table 1 show some general features that have been identified \nbefore (Parker, 1983). For inorganic N, deposition in TF on average is similar to wet \ndeposition, but with considerable scatter across sites. However, for sites where dry \ndeposition has been estimated, inorganic N in TF represents only around half of the \nestimated (wet + dry) input from the atmosphere, implying that half is retained in the \ncanopy. Total N deposition (inorganic + organic) in TF (and SF where measured) is \nsimilar on average to total N deposition in precipitation, with smaller deviations above \nand below a 1:1 ratio than for inorganic N. However, for those sites at which dry \ndeposition has been estimated, total N in TF+SF is only around 80% of estimated \ninputs (on average), with net retention of N at almost all sites. For organic N, below-\ncanopy deposition in TF is on average 24% of total (wet + dry) N input, and accounts \nfor 36% of total N in TF. Large enhancement of organic N deposition in TF compared \nto wet deposition occurs particularly where wet deposition of organic N is small. At a \nfew sites there is net retention of organic N in the canopy, implying that leaves or \nepiphytic organisms can utilise organic N, or that organic N is removed from solution \nby adsorption or absorption by canopy surfaces. Because of the lack of information on \nthe chemical composition of organic N, we do no know whether the \u2018organic N\u2019 \nmeasured in precipitation is chemically modified before being measured as \u2018organic \nN\u2019 in TF. There is also no information on the contribution of dry deposition of organic \nN to canopies, although it undoubtedly occurs (Gonz\u00e1lez Ben\u00edtez et al., 2009), so that \nretention of organic N by canopies may be systematically underestimated. \n \nConclusions from field manipulation experiments \nExperimental manipulations can be used to determine the potential for systems to \nrespond to changes in N inputs, although they do not necessarily provide a good \nindication of long-term behaviour.  They can, however, be very useful in identifying \npathways and processes. The use of stable isotopes to study the rate of exchange of \nmaterial with plant canopies has already been mentioned (Dail et al., 2009, Gaige et \nal., 2007) in a study where a large input of N was applied to a forest with relatively \nlow N deposition. This study demonstrated that exchange processes occurred rapidly, \nand generated significant transformation of inorganic to organic N in the process. We \ndo not know, however, whether the canopy itself or the epiphytes it supported would \nhave produced the same response under sustained inputs at the same level over many \nyears, when the greater availability of N might have led to profound changes in the \ncanopy structure and composition.  \n 9 \n \nThe AMBER experiment described above showed that short-term exposure to NH3 \nled to changes in canopy behaviour, particularly with respect to nitrate, although, \nbecause \n15\nN was not used, we could not determine whether the apparent change in \nnitrate behaviour (from retention to no retention) was attributable to nitrification of \ndeposited NH3 in the canopy, as has been reported elsewhere after chronic exposure to \nhigh NH3 concentrations over many years, albeit within leaves rather than on leaf \nsurfaces (Papen et al., 2002). Although the dry deposition of NH3 and other inorganic \nN components (aerosol ammonium and nitrate, nitric acid) could only be crudely \nestimated, a large quantity of NH3 relative to the \u2018control\u2019 plots (27 mmol m\n-2\n) was \ndeposited in TF as NH4\n+\n, presumably washed from the canopy surfaces by rain. What \nwas significant, though, was the small fraction of dry deposited NH3 that was \ntransformed to organic N, indicating a finite capacity for transformation of inorganic \nN in this canopy of around 1.6 mmol m\n-2\n mth\n-1\n under summer conditions. \n \nThe Deepsyke experiment followed 5 years of treatment, so the surface epiphytes and \nmicrobial populations may have already adapted somewhat to the additional N inputs. \nMoreover, the N additions were made in small increments between May and \nNovember each year, more frequently and with much smaller solution concentrations \nthan the 5 applications during the growing season in the helicopter experiment (Gaige \net al., 2007). As observed at the AMBER site, albeit with a different tree species, the \nnet amount of organic N measured below the canopy was a very small fraction of the \ntotal N applied to the canopy, again suggesting a finite capacity to transform \nadditional inorganic N, in this case around 1 mmol m\n-2\n mth\n-1\n under the same summer \nconditions (the same year). There is also some evidence (Figure 5) that additional \nacidity may inhibit NH4\n+\n retention and enhance NO3\n- \nretention (Cape et al., 2001a, \nChiwa et al., 2004). Comparison of the A (acid) and D (no acid) treatments showed 19 \n\u00b1 9 (n = 4 plots) mmol m\n-2\n NH4\n+\n retained in the absence of acid, and 6 \u00b1 7 (n = 2) \nmmol m\n-2\n with acid. The equivalent figures for NO3\n-\n are 10 \u00b1 13 mmol m\n-2\n without \nacid and 26 \u00b1 1 mmol m\n-2\n with acid. The latter may include losses of gaseous HNO3 \nfrom the canopy, rather than retention. For organic N, no effect of acid was observed, \nwith net formation of 6 \u00b1 2 mmol m\n-2\n in both treatments. \n \nConclusions \nThe fate of organic N in the transformation and utilisation of atmospheric N \ndeposition in plant canopies is important, because it may have implications for the \nsubsequent transformation and utilisation of N in forest soils and reuse by plants. The \ncapacity of forest canopies to generate organic N from inorganic N has been shown to \nbe limited, but of sufficient size to make measurable changes to the organic N content \nof TF for most forests, which have ambient inputs in the range of 5-30 kg N ha\n-1\n y\n-1\n \n(35 \u2013 200 mmol N m-2 y-1). The experimentally determined upper limit to the capacity \nfor net organic N production in summer months in southern Scotland was similar for \nboth conifer species, despite the differences in species, age, size and canopy structure, \nat up to 1.6 mmol N m\n-2\n mth\n-1\n,\n \nbased on assumed limiting production rates in the \n 10 \npresence of a large excess of inorganic N deposition to the canopy. This may be \ncontrasted with results for a mature conifer forest in eastern North America (Gaige et \nal., 2007), where canopy retention of experimentally applied inorganic N was up to \n80% or 20 mmol N m\n-2\n mth\n-1\n during the growing season. This very large % retention \nwas ascribed to the canopy architecture and the means of delivery, as small droplets of \n0.48M NH4NO3 solution from a helicopter. Some of the apparent retention (estimated \nas 5-10% of input) was loss from the canopy of gaseous HNO3 during the first 24h \nafter application (Dail et al., 2009). However the authors did not estimate the potential \nloss of deposited NH4NO3 as gaseous NH3 and HNO3 following dissociation of the \nsalt during deposition, or over a longer period on the canopy surface (Stelson and \nSeinfeld, 2007).  \n \nThe transformations that occur in canopies also appear to be strongly dependent on \nthe N status of the forest (Crockford and Khanna, 1997), and not simply on the \natmospheric inputs. It is possible that the increased organic N in TF observed in the \nexperiments presented above was mediated through the roots, as a response to \nincreased TF deposition. At both sites, there had been exposure to enhanced N \ndeposition for at least a year prior to the TF measurements of organic N. At the \nAMBER experiment there are no data on leaf N status, but at Deepsyke leaf N status \nwas closely followed; when leaf tissue N concentrations were measured in 2000 there \nwas no significant difference in needle N concentrations across treatments (except for \nthe double-dose N + acid treatment) (Sheppard et al., 2004). For many forests that \nhave been exposed to air pollution for decades, however, the N status may be well \ncorrelated with the deposition, making interpretation more difficult. However, given \nthe magnitude of the in-canopy N transformations that can occur under low to \nmoderate N inputs and the potential role of the different components of organic N in \nsoil processes, the importance of the canopy in modifying the chemical composition \nof organic N should not be ignored.  \n \nThe experiments described here show that the quantitative transformation between \ninorganic and organic N in these forest canopies in a Scottish summer is probably not \nimportant relative to the large additions of N provided in the experimental treatments. \nHowever, the data show that the organic N deposition flux can increase or decrease as \nwater moves through the canopy, depending on the availability of inorganic N. The \nimplied (bio)chemical conversion has implications for the fate of TF nitrogen in the \nsoil; processing of organic N in soil has been studied in more detail, taking as inputs \nto the soil surface the TF and SF that can be relatively simply measured below the \nforest canopy (Michalzik and Matzner, 1999, M\u00f6ller et al., 2005, Qualls, 2000, Qualls \nand Haines, 1992). Attempts to estimate the complete budget of N inputs to forests for \ncomparison with eventual drainage outputs, however, need to explicitly include not \nonly the wet deposition of organic N (as recorded in Table 1), but the dry deposition \nof inorganic N (for which approximate estimates can be derived from measured air \nconcentrations of gases and particles) and of organic N, for which no relevant data are \nyet available. Unfortunately, the simple use of TF data in estimating N inputs misses \n 11 \nthe direct uptake of N in the canopy, which can inhibit root uptake and therefore \ninfluence below-ground processing of N (Rennenberg and Gessler, 1999). Moreover, \nthe use of only inorganic N deposition as input for risk assessments, e.g. in the \nCritical Loads approach used widely in Europe (Achermann and Bobbink, 2003), \nmeans that the importance of organic N deposition from the atmosphere and its \nsubsequent progress through canopies and soils is effectively ignored. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe studies at the AMBER field site and at Deepsyke forest were supported by the \nUK Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs under contracts WA0719 \nand EPG 1\/3\/186, respectively, and by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.
