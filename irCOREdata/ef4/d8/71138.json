Lett., 32, L12101, doi:10.1029\/2005GL022813.\n1. Introduction\n[2] The importance of the reconnection process in the\nformation of the cusps has been extensively studied, and it\nis now understood that the cusp can be populated by plasma\nentry from either dayside or lobe reconnection, depending\non the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) orientation\n[Dungey, 1961, 1963]. Moreover, Fuselier et al. [2000]\nsuggested that lobe and sub-solar reconnection could occur\nsimultaneously under northward IMF. Song and Russell\n[1992] and Lockwood and Moen [1999] discussed recon-\nnection geometries during northward IMF and suggested\nthat open magnetic field lines reconnected at high-latitudes\nin one hemisphere, could be re-reconnected in the other\nhemisphere, thus creating newly closed field lines. The\norder of occurrence of reconnection at the two sites depends\non the dipole tilt and on IMF BX.\n[3] The interface between the high-altitude cusp and\nthe magnetosheath has been the topic of debate since\nPaschmann et al. [1976] and Haerendel et al. [1978]\nproposed the existence of the \u2018entry layer\u2019 and \u2018stagnation\nregion\u2019. The existence of this latter region, the Stagnant\nExterior Cusp (SEC), within the high-altitude cusp was\nconfirmed recently by Cluster [e.g., Lavraud et al., 2004].\nHowever, the processes forming the SEC are still uncertain.\n[4] In this paper we discuss Cluster observations of the\nhigh-altitude cusp under steady northward IMF during the\nperiod 0530\u20130900 UT on 16 March 2002. The observations\nwere previously presented by Lavraud et al. [2004]. We use\nthe SuperDARN radar data in order to examine ionospheric\nplasma convection and constrain the location of particle\ninjections into the magnetosphere. We suggest the character-\nistics of the SEC can be explained as this region being\nlocated on re-closed magnetic field lines. These field lines\nappear to have been first opened by reconnection on the\nnorthern lobe magnetopause and subsequently re-closed by\na second reconnection with older open field lines on the\nsouthern lobe magnetopause.\n2. Instrumentation, Cluster Orbit and Solar\nWind Conditions\n[5] We use Cluster data from the Plasma Electron and\nCurrent Experiment (PEACE) [Johnstone et al., 1997], the\nHot Ion Analyzer (HIA) and Composition and Distribution\nFunction (CODIF) sensors of the Cluster Ion Spectrometer\n(CIS) [Re`me et al., 2001] and the Flux Gate Magnetometer\n(FGM) [Balogh et al., 2001]. Ionospheric plasma convec-\ntion is derived from measurements of 2 coherent HF radars\nof the SuperDARN network [Greenwald et al., 1995].\n[6] At \u00010605 UT on March 16, 2002, the centroid of the\n4 Cluster spacecraft was located at (1.96, \u00020.18, 7.55) RE\nGSM and 1148 MLT. Over the next 2 hours the spacecraft\nmoved \u00013 RE in the +X GSM direction, but remained near\nnoon MLT and within the cusp. Cluster inter-spacecraft\nseparations were only 50\u2013150 km, so the plasma properties\nobserved at each spacecraft are similar. We thus present\nCluster observations from SC1 only.\n[7] During the period of interest the IMF, observed by the\nWIND spacecraft located at (34, \u0002130, \u000255) RE GSM, had\na strong northward GSM component, BZ = 3\u20136 nT, and\npointed duskward, BY \u0001 2\u20136 nT, and steadily antisunward,\nBX = \u00024 nT (see Lavraud et al., 2004, Figure 2). The IMF\nclock-angle was in the range (30\u0001 \u00b1 15\u0001). The solar wind\ndynamic pressure was 3.5\u20134 nPa, decreasing at the end of\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 32, L12101, doi:10.1029\/2005GL022813, 2005\n1Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London,\nDorking, UK.\n2Space Science and Technology Department, Rutherford Appleton\nLaboratory, Didcot, UK.\n3Space Science Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley,\nCalifornia, USA.\n4Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\n5Max-Planck-Institut fu\u00a8r Extraterrestrische Physik, Garching, Germany.\nCopyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/05\/2005GL022813$05.00\nL12101 1 of 5\nthe interval. The IMF configuration during the event\nsuggests that anti-parallel merging may take place on the\nnorthern lobe magnetopause in the dusk sector [Crooker,\n1979].\n3. Cluster Observations\n[8] An overview of Cluster particle and magnetic field\ndata is shown in Figure 1. Panel (a) presents differential\nenergy flux of electrons of energy 20\u2013820 eV. The 9 sub-\npanels show the pitch-angle distribution (0\u0001\u2013180\u0001) for the\nenergy channel centered on the value given on the left of the\npanel. Panel (b) shows the H+ energy-time spectrogram\nmeasured by CODIF. Panel (c) presents energy-time spec-\ntrogram of 5 keV < E < 28 keV ions measured by HIA.\nPanels (d) and (e) present the pitch-angle spectrograms of\nE = 20\u2013100 eV and E = 0.1\u20133 keV H+ ions respectively.\nPanel (f) shows electron anisotropy Tke\/T?e. The H\n+ (grey,\nred in the HTML version) and electron (black) parallel\nvelocities, Vk, are shown in panel (g), while the\ncorresponding two GSM components of the perpendicular\nvelocities, V?X and V?Y, are shown in panels (h) and (i)\nrespectively. The final three panels present the GSM com-\nponents BZ, BY, BX of the magnetic field.\n[9] At the beginning of the interval shown, Cluster was in\nthe north lobe, but crossed the poleward boundary of the\nhigh-altitude cusp at \u00010605 UT [Lavraud et al., 2004]. This\nregion (Region 1 in Figure 1) is characterized by the\nappearance of strong down-going magnetosheath-like ion\ninjections (panels d, e, g) and high fluxes of bi-directional,\nshort-duration electron beams (a) with large temperature\nanisotropy (f) and net field-aligned flow (g). The parallel\nvelocities of H+ ions and electrons were high, \u0001270\u2013\n310 km s\u00021 (g). Plasma convection past the spacecraft\nwas mainly dawnward (\u000260 \u0005 V?Y \u0005 0 km s\u00021, panel\n(i)) and sunward (0 \u0005 V?X \u0005 45 km s\u00021, panel (h)). Particle\nsignatures in this region are in agreement with plasma\ninjections from the anti-parallel dusk-lobe reconnection\nsite. The magnetic field configuration (j\u2013 l) shows that\nCluster crossed field lines which were directed earthward\nand anti-sunward (BZ < 0, BX < 0).\n[10] At \u00010710 UT Cluster entered the SEC, marked as\nRegion 2 and defined for this event by Lavraud et al. [2004]\nas a region of highly-isotropic, stagnant H+ ions and\nmagnetic field strength depression. However, electrons\ninside the SEC are isotropic only for \u000130 minutes from\n\u00010718 UT, when Tke\/T?e \u0001 1. Before and after this period\nin the SEC region, electrons with energies E = 20\u2013200 eV\nhave higher fluxes in the parallel and anti-parallel directions\nthan in perpendicular direction (a) such that Tke\/T?e > 1. In\naddition, the degree of proton isotropy is a function of\nparticle energy: while the E = 0.1\u20133 keV H+ ions were near-\nisotropic (e), the 20 < E < 100 eV proton population\nremains anisotropic (d), with higher parallel and anti-\nparallel fluxes. Also from \u00010700 UT, a strong flux\nenhancement of 5 keV < E < 10 keV ions was detected\n(c), and continued throughout the SEC crossing. The\nparallel velocities of both ions and electrons inside the\nSEC are very small (g). The sunward component of\nthe perpendicular plasma velocity was also small (h), while\na slow dawnward convection, (\u000220 \u0005 V?Y \u0005 0 km s\u00021,\npanel (i)) was evident (cf. Cluster spacecraft motion sunward\nat \u00013 km s\u00021). The magnetic field in this region was\nvery weak and directed anti-sunward (\u000210 < BX < \u000220 nT,\nBY \u0001 BZ \u0001 0).\n[11] Between \u00010801\u20130813 UT (Region 3 in Figure 1),\nthe parallel velocity of both protons and electrons turned\nnegative, at \u0001\u000260 km s\u00021. Examination of H+ pitch-angle\ndistributions shows that low-energy (20 < E < 100 eV) ions\nmove mostly parallel to the field while ions with higher\nenergy (E = 0.1\u20133 keV) move in the anti-parallel direction.\nThe fluxes of 5 keV < E < 10 keV ions show a monotonic\ndecrease during this period. Electrons with energies E =\n25\u2013150 eV show bi-directional streaming along the field\nwith slightly higher anti-parallel fluxes than parallel. Plasma\nconvection showed a small increase in the anti-sunward\ndirection. From 0801 UT the BZ and BY components\nbecome increasingly positive, while the BX component\nremained dominant and monotonically increased to\n\u0001\u000240 nT by the end of this interval. At \u00010813 UT Cluster\ncrossed into the magnetosheath (see Lavraud et al. [2004]\nfor details).\n4. Ionospheric Convection and Reconnection\nGeometry\n[12] There is no radar coverage in the dusk sector, but the\nnoon and dawn sectors were in the field of view of the\nFigure 1. Cluster data for 16 March 2002. See text for\ndetails. See color version of this figure in the HTML.\nL12101 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: FORMATION OF THE STAGNANT CUSP L12101\n2 of 5\nCUTLASS Hankasalmi (H) and Thikkvibaer (T) radars (at\n59.78\u0001 and 64.59\u0001 MLAT respectively). At 07:00 UT these\nradars are located at 09:08 and 06:46 MLT respectively.\nFigure 2 shows range-time plots of the line-of-sight (l-o-s)\nvelocity from three different beams of these radars. Positive\n(negative) velocities represent plasma motion towards\n(away from) the radar. During the time of interest, beam\n12 from the H radar (Figure 2a) points mainly duskward and\ndetects plasma convection at 12\u201313 MLT and 76\u201382\u0001\nMLAT, close to the Cluster footprint moving between\n76\u201379\u0001 MLAT at \u000111:50 MLT. Beam 2 from the T radar\n(Figure 2b) also points mainly duskward, monitoring con-\nvection at 10\u201312 MLT and 79\u201382\u0001 MLAT. Finally, beam 2\nfrom the H radar (Figure 2c) points in the duskward\/\npoleward direction and detects convection in the dawn\nsector, 5:30\u20137:30 MLT and 76\u201380\u0001 MLAT.\n[13] When Cluster was in Region 1, strong dawnward\nplasma convection in the ionosphere at speeds of 400\u2013\n700 m s\u00021 is observed near the Cluster footprint (Figure 2a)\ntogether with dawnward convection at speeds of 200\u2013\n600 m s\u00021 in the pre-noon sector (Figure 2b). Dawnward\nionospheric convection is in agreement with Cluster obser-\nvations of the plasma injections from the dusk-lobe\nreconnection site. When Cluster was in the SEC, the iono-\nspheric data near the Cluster footprint (Figure 2a) were\nvery sparse, most likely due to the absence of plasma\nirregularities. However, poleward and dawnward of Cluster,\nin the pre-noon sector, dawnward convection continues at\nspeeds of 100\u2013500 m s\u00021 (Figure 2b). The lack of change\nin the convection pattern in this sector strongly suggests that\nthe duskside anti-parallel merging site continued to operate\nwhile Cluster was in the SEC.\n[14] Throughout the entire time of interest, a region of\nenhanced anti-sunward and duskward convection was\ndetected by the H radar\u2019s beams 1\u20135 in the dawn sector,\n6\u20139 MLT and 78\u201383\u0001 MLAT. Figure 2c shows well-\ndefined repetitive Pulsed Ionospheric Flows (PIFs, black\nlines), which usually are interpreted as ionospheric signa-\ntures of FTEs [e.g., Pinnock et al., 1995] from an active\nreconnection site. The location of the detected PIFs maps\nalong magnetic field lines to the dawn-lobe magnetopause.\nThis indicates that a second reconnection site operates in the\ndawn sector, and that this also persisted for the 2 hours that\nCluster was in the Region 1 and SEC.\n5. Discussion and Interpretation\n[15] The relatively smooth transitions in the plasma and\nmagnetic field properties as Cluster enters the SEC from the\nRegion 1 at \u00010710 UT, suggests that the SEC region is not\nan isolated region but evolves from the high-altitude cusp\nproper. However, the absence of energy-latitude dispersions,\nthe low levels of convection and bulk parallel flow and the\nnear isotropy of the plasma in the SEC are not consistent\nwith the SEC being located on \u2018open\u2019 reconnected field\nlines.\n[16] We believe the possible explanation for the forma-\ntion of this exterior cusp is based on observations that two\nreconnection sites were active on the magnetopause. We\nthus consider the possibility that the SEC is formed on field\nlines that are first opened at one of these reconnection sites\noperating in one hemisphere, but then re-closed at the other\nreconnection site in the other hemisphere [e.g., Song and\nRussell, 1992; Onsager et al., 2001]. Since IMF BX was\nnegative, we expect reconnection to have occurred first in\nthe northern hemisphere and later in the southern hemi-\nsphere. If such a reconnection configuration exists, then\nCluster, moving from nightside to dayside, may cross\nseveral different regions as illustrated schematically in\nFigure 3a: firstly the magnetospheric parts of field lines\nreconnected only in the northern hemisphere; then those\nre-closed by undergoing a second reconnection in the\nsouthern hemisphere; and finally, the magnetosheath part\nof the field lines reconnected only in the northern\nhemisphere.\n[17] Between 0605\u20130710 UT, the dawnward and sun-\nward plasma convection at Cluster, as well as in the\nionosphere near 12 MLT indicate that Cluster was located\non field lines reconnected on the northern lobe-dusk\nmagnetopause. The anti-sunward magnetic field orientation\n(BZ < 0, BX < 0) corresponds to inner magnetospheric\npart of the cusp throat. The parallel velocity dispersion\n(Figure 1g) can be explained by Cluster moving onto field\nlines with longer time histories since reconnection. Thus the\ndata indicate that Cluster was on open field lines in the inner\npart of the cusp throat and observing plasma injection from\nreconnection on the northern hemisphere, dusk-side lobe\nmagnetopause. We thus associate Region 1 in Figure 3a\nwith the cusp proper (CP).\n[18] Inside the SEC region, between 0710 and 0801 UT,\nCluster moved sunward by 1.5 RE and higher in altitude by\n0.27 RE. Initially, the magnetic field had similar orientation\nto the CP, consistent with remaining within the magneto-\nspheric part of the cusp throat. However, after 0730 UT,\nBY \u0001 BZ \u0001 0, consistent with the spacecraft being located\nnear the \u2018turn-over\u2019 part of dayside magnetic field lines.\nInside the SEC, convection was very slow, consistent with\nmagnetic field lines which have become disconnected from\nthe solar wind driver. Onsager et al. [2001] suggest that\nparticles populating re-closed flux tubes may have under-\ngone multiple accelerations at the two reconnection sites\nand thus would be hotter than those accelerated once on an\nFigure 2.

The observation of the strong enhancement\nof ion flux at energies 5\u201310 keV is thus consistent with the\n\u2018double reconnection\u2019 hypothesis. Parallel and anti-parallel\nfluxes on re-closed field lines should initially exceed\nperpendicular fluxes, as observed in low-energy ions.\nHowever, due to pitch angle scattering, distributions\nshould become more isotropic (Tke\/T?e \u0001 1) with time,\nespecially for the higher energy ions and electrons with\nshorter bounce times, as is also observed during this\nperiod. These characteristics are all thus consistent with\nthe SEC being located on re-closed field lines (Region 2 in\nFigure 3a).\n[19] Between 0801 and 0813 UT, the observed magnetic\nfield rotates monotonically towards the magnetosheath\norientation and increases in strength, while the plasma\nconvection increases and becomes anti-sunward, also more\ntypical of the magnetosheath. The high-energy (5 keV < E <\n10 keV) ions disappear. In this region, there is a net anti-\nfield-aligned flow of both electrons and ions, so particle\nfluxes away from the northern ionosphere exceed those\ntowards it. However, low energy H+ is concentrated at pitch\nangles <60\u0001, and thus observed to be moving towards the\nlikely northern hemisphere high-latitude reconnection site,\nwhile the higher energy protons peak at >120\u0001 and may thus\nrepresent the reconnection outflow. Similar behaviour can\nbe discerned in the electron populations. These data are\nconsistent with Cluster crossing out onto the magnetosheath\nportion of field lines which have been reconnected only\nonce (Region 3 in Figure 3a).\n[20] The observations of enhanced anti-sunward and\nduskward flow in the dawnside sector by SuperDARN\nchallenge our interpretation. Such enhanced flow is charac-\nteristic of reconnection of the magnetosheath field with\nclosed \u2018dayside\u2019 field lines driving fast flows on newly\nopened field lines. However, note that for this IMF\norientation, a flux tube reconnected poleward of the\nnorthern cusp and dragged sunward and dawnward (e.g.\nthe field line marked \u2018A\u2019 in Figure 3b) cannot, in steady\nstate, be convected over a neutral line operating on the\ndawn flank without being re-closed (field line \u2018B\u2019). Alter-\nnatively, draping of the magnetosheath field may provide\nsufficient shear to allow component reconnection [e.g.,\nSonnerup, 1974] on the dawnside between magnetosheath\nflux and closed dayside flux tubes, to result in open flux\ntubes (marked \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019), one of which is magnetically\nconnected to the northern dawnside polar regions. We\ntherefore conclude that the south X-line extends across\nthe interface between closed dayside and open lobe type\nflux tubes in order to create field lines of both types \u2018B\u2019\nand \u2018D\u2019.\n6. Conclusion\n[21] During this event, Cluster and SuperDARN data\nsuggest the existence of two stable reconnection sites: one\nin the dusk sector of the northern hemisphere and another in\nthe dawn sector of the southern hemisphere. Cluster,\nmoving along the noon meridian, first detects plasma\ninjections from the dusk sector, consistent with high-latitude\nnorthern hemisphere anti-parallel merging. It subsequently\nmoved into a stagnant exterior cusp region, where the\nparticle populations could be explained as being located\non field lines that have been re-closed by the reconnection\nin the dawn sector in south hemisphere, as suggested by\nSuperDARN data. Finally, before entering the magneto-\nsheath proper, the spacecraft cross a region with character-\nistics consistent with the exterior portion of those field lines\nreconnected only at the high-latitude northern hemisphere\nanti-parallel merging site. Our primary conclusion,\ntherefore, is that in this event the stagnant exterior cusp\nis formed on field lines that have undergone \u2018double\nreconnection\u2019, being first opened in the northern hemisphere\nand subsequently re-closed by southern hemisphere recon-\nnection. The re-closing of these field lines decouples the\nregion from the influence of the solar wind flow, and thus\naccounts for the lack of significant convection, the lack of\nparticle injections and the closely isotropic nature of the\nplasma populations.\n[22] Acknowledgments.
