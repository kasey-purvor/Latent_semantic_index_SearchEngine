Introduction \nThe boreal forest biome represents the largest continuous forested area of the globe. The \nforests in this region cover approximately 15 million km2, or about 10% of the Earth\u2019s \nterrestrial surface. This represents about 33% of all forested areas in the world (FRA \n2000) and over 73% of the world\u2019s coniferous forests (ECE\/FAO 1985).\nThe boreal forests play a key role in the Earth\u2019s carbon balance because of their \nextent  and  the  large  carbon reserves  they contain.  To date,  scientists  have  built  up \nevidence  suggesting  that  greenhouse  gas  induced  global  warming  is  occurring.  For \nexample, Canada and Russia have recorded a 2\u00b0-3\u00b0C temperature increase in the winter \nand spring over the last 30 years (Environment Canada 1995) and in artic Alaska and \nwestern Canada a summer warming of 3\u00b0- 4\u00b0C has been observed over the last 40 years \nwhich has been attributed to the lengthening of the snow-free season (Chapin III et al. \n2005). Some of the predicted trends in this region caused by global warming under a \ndoubled CO2 scenario are (1) increased length of fire season (Wotton and Flannigan \n1993,  Stocks  et  al.  1998),  (2)  increased  fire  weather  severity  (Flannigan  and  Van \nWagner 1991, Stocks et al. 1998), and (3) increased ignitions from lightning (Fosberg \net  al.  1990).  In  fact,  Ria\u00f1o  et  al.  (2007)  report  that  the  first  impacts  of  these \nperturbations  can  already  be  seen.  They  found  that  burned  area  has  significantly \nincreased during summer in the boreal region between 1981 and 2000. The accelerating \nfire activity - predicted to increase burned area by 25-50% over the next century- will \nhave  an  impact  on  a  wide  range  of  ecosystem processes  controlling  the  storage  of \ncarbon in boreal forests (Kasischke 2000).\nChanges in vegetation structure influence not only the exchange of greenhouse \ngases but also albedo and energy partitioning, all of which influence climate feedbacks. \nIn the boreal region, shifts between evergreen and deciduous trees are believed to cause \nthe strongest feedback (Eugster  et al. 2000). For example,  an increase in fire events \nincreases  the  proportion  of  early  succession  deciduous  woods  and  consequently \nincreases  the  albedo,  decreases  heat  transfer  to  the  atmosphere  and  decreases  the \nflammability  of  boreal  forests  causing  a  negative  feedback  whilst  transition  to  late \nsuccessional evergreen conifers decreases the winter albedo and is a positive climate \nfeedback  (McGuire  et  al.  2006).  In  Russian  forests,  an  estimated  40-96% of  total \nforested area is in some phase of post-fire succession (Rojkov et al. 1996). Russia alone \ncontains  about  two-thirds  of  the  world\u2019s  boreal  forest,  and  most  of  it  is  present  in \nSiberia. Shvidenko and Nilsson (1994) estimated that over 20% of the world forested \narea  and 50% of  the  world  coniferous  forested  area  is  located  in  Siberia.  A better \nunderstanding  of  post-fire  succession  in  the  Siberian  boreal  forests  will  help  us  to \npredict the effects of the increasing number of wildfires caused by climate change in \nthese ecosystems, and subsequently forecast the future role of Siberian boreal forests as \na carbon sink or source.\nSome  post-disturbance  dynamics  studies  in  boreal  forests  based  on  field \nsurveys  have been carried out with diverse purposes: (1) studying the effects  of fire \nbehaviour  on  regeneration  (Furyaev  et  al.  2001,  Arseneault  2001,  Babintseva  and \nTitova  1996,  Schimmel  and  Granstr\u00f6m  1996),  (2)  analysing  carbon  exchanges  of \nregenerating forests (Meroni et al. 2002, Valentini et al. 2000), (3) investigating forest \ncomposition (Johnstone et al. 2004, De Grandpre et al. 2000, Bergeron and Dansereau \n1993) and (4) measuring vegetation diversity (Peltzer  et al. 2000, Fortin  et al. 1999). \nHowever, fires in the boreal region are subject to large annual fluctuations which are \nassociated with weather patterns such as low precipitation (Jupp et al. 2006) and high \n3\ntemperature. Some estimates indicate that between 5 and 10 million ha of boreal forest \nburn each year,  with most  of the area  being burned in  fires  bigger  than 50 000 ha \n(Kasischke and French 1997). With such high rates of change in boreal ecosystems, and \nthe remoteness of some burned areas and their huge extent, it is clear that traditional \nstudies of forest succession based on field surveys should be complemented by analyses \nwith remote sensing data which provide timely information on forest ecosystem status \nfor large areas and in a cost efficient manner (Song et al. 2002).\nFire  creates  profound  changes  in  ecosystems,  causing  variations  in  surface \nreflectance,  albedo,  moisture  and  temperature,  which  can  be  detected  by  means  of \nsatellite imagery.  Satellite imagery can also quantify the annual fluctuations in forest \nfires,  despite  the  remoteness  and  large  sizes  of  the  burned  areas  because  of  its \nsystematic,  periodic  and  global  acquisition.  Several  studies  have  addressed  post-\ndisturbance dynamics using remote sensed imagery with different objectives such as (1) \nstudying the relationships between the time elapsed since fire and the recovery stage \n(Ria\u00f1o et al. 2002, Diaz-Delgado and Pons 2001, Henry and Hope 1998, Viedma et al. \n1997),  (2) studying the effects  of fire  severity on regeneration (Diaz-Delgado  et al. \n2003,  Jakubauskas  et  al.  1990),  (3)  quantifying  spatial  patterns  of  post-disturbance \nvegetation (Schroeder and Perera 2002), (4) mapping successional forest communities \n(Ustin and Xiao 2001, Steyaert et al. 1997), or (5) mapping the fractional cover of post-\ndisturbance  vegetation  layers  (Vine  and  Puech  1999).  The  use  of  remotely  sensed \nspectral  vegetation indices is a common element in many of their  methodologies. In \nthese  studies  various  types  of  vegetation  indices  have  been  tested  such  as  the \nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; Hicke et al. 2003, Diaz-Delgado et al. \n2003, Ria\u00f1o  et al. 2002, Ustin and Xiao 2001, Henry and Hope 1998, Steyaert  et al. \n1997),  the  Soil  Adjusted  Vegetation  Index  (SAVI;  Henry  and  Hope  1998),  the \nNormalized Difference between NIR and SWIR bands (infrared index; Marchetti et al. \n1995), and the Structural Index and Tasselled Cap Transformation (Fiorella and Ripple \n1993). Other authors have created specific indices to assess the recovery of vegetation. \nDiaz-Delgado et al. (1998) used unburned control plots (with similar environmental and \nvegetation conditions like the burned sites to correct for external influences) to calculate \nthe Regeneration Index (RI). Ria\u00f1o et al. (2002) used this index and also produced the \nNormalized  Regeneration  Index  (NRI)  that  takes  into  account  possible  microsite \ndifferences between plots in terms of total  recovery and Diaz-Delgado  et al.  (2003) \nproduced two new indicators called 'damage' and 'unrecovered_NDVI' to measure fire \nseverity and successful regeneration, respectively, to study their interactions.\nIn remote sensing studies, post-fire dynamics analyses have been carried out \nmostly  in  Mediterranean  ecosystems  (Diaz-Delgado  et  al.  2003,  Ria\u00f1o  et  al.  2002, \nHenry and Hope 1998, Marchetti et al. 1995). Only a few studied the post-disturbance \ndynamics in the boreal forest. Hicke  et al. (2003) assessed the impact of fire on Net \nPrimary  Production  (NPP)  using  a  17-year  record  of  satellite  NDVI  observations \ntogether with a light use efficiency model.  NPP is function of a light use efficiency \n(LUE)  coefficient,  the  fraction  of  Absorbed  Photosynthetically  Active  Radiation \n(fAPAR)  and  the  incoming  Photosynthetic  Active  Radiation  (PAR).  These  authors \nestimated a mean NPP recovery period for boreal forests in Canada of about 9 years, by \ncomparing  pre  and  post-fire  observations.  Schroeder  and  Pereira  (2002)  examined \nspatial patterns of forest cover in post-fire landscapes over a period of four decades. \nThey found that the time elapsed since the disturbance has a significant effect on the \nspatial pattern of the vegetation. Recent disturbances have fewer and more aggregated \nland cover types, and larger and less numerous patches compared to older disturbances. \n4\nUstin and Xiao (2001) and Steyaert et al. (1997) mapped boreal forests in terms of their \nregeneration stage.\nThis  study  aimed  to  establish  whether  recently  burned  areas  in  the  boreal \nforests of Siberia show characteristic patterns of post-fire fAPAR as a function of their \nlatitude  and forest  type.  If  we are  able  to  determine  these  patterns,  the  models  for \nestimating carbon fluxes after  disturbances in boreal forests can be improved.  Many \nprevious studies on fire effects in boreal forests using remote sensing have focused on \nmonitoring the location and extent of fires and estimating the amount of CO2 directly \nreleased  through  biomass  burning.  However,  for  studies  of  carbon  flux  it  is  also \nnecessary to monitor the effects of fire on specific properties, including soil moisture \nand surface temperature, and ecological processes such as vegetation re-growth (French \net  al.  1996).  fAPAR  has  been  used  extensively  as  a  satellite  derived  intermediate \nvariable for the calculation of surface photosynthesis, evapotranspiration and annual net \nprimary  production  (Myneni  et  al.  2003).  This  study  is  a  first  assessment  of  the \nsuitability of satellite derived fAPAR to understand the behaviour of forest areas one \nand two years after a fire event.\n2. Material and methods\n2.1. Study area\nThe study area is the SIBERIA-II region (Schmullius and Hese 2002) which is located \nin the Central Siberian region, stretching from 52-72\u00b0 Northern latitude and 88-110\u00b0 \nEastern longitude (Figure 1). Its 3.2 million km\u00b2 area is a mosaic of taiga forest (pine, \nPinus  sylvestris  L.;  spruce,  Picea  obovata  Ledeb.;  fir,  Abies  sibirica  Ledeb.;  larch, \nLarix sibirica  Ledeb.; cedar,  Pinus sibirica  Mayr.; birch,  Betula pendula  Roth and B. \npubescens  Ehrh;  and  aspen,  Populus  tremula  L.),  wetland,  open  areas  and  rivers, \nencompassing some of the economically most valuable forest stands. Agricultural land \nis  predominantly  seen  around  the  cities  of  Krasnoyarsk  and  Irkutsk.  The  overall \ntopographic elevation of the study area is  relatively low except  in the southern part \napproaching the Mongolian border.\nThe climate of the boreal forest is highly continental with short, warm, and \nhumid  summers  and long,  extremely  cold  and dry  winters.  This  biome as  a  whole \nreceives  low  amounts  of  precipitation  and  daylight  summer  temperatures  of  20\u00ba, \noccasionally up to 30\u00ba, are common. Under these circumstances the upper organic soil \nhorizons can become desiccated which together with the higher temperatures and the \nlow relative humidity create conditions favourable to fire (Kasischke 2000).\nWeather patterns are considered to be the most important factor controlling fire \noccurrence (Stocks and Street  1983; Soja  et al.,  2004). Fire is  a natural  disturbance \nfactor which occurs regularly in the boreal forest of Siberia with the area burned being \nabout 35000 km\u00b2 yr-1 on average (0.6% of the forested area) (Shvidenko and Nilsson \n1999). Much of the floristic diversity and many mosaic vegetation patterns within the \nboreal  forest  are  directly  attributable  to  recurring  fires.  The  boreal  forest  biome  is \ncomposed of a few plant species. In fact, eight tree species make up about 83% of all \nSiberian  forests  (Shvidenko  and  Nilsson  1994,  Wirth  2005).  In  Siberia,  early \nsuccessional  deciduous  species,  such  as  birch  and  aspen,  are  later  succeeded  by \nconifers, such as spruce. Although there are also early successional conifers such as \nScots Pine and larch, the aspen-birch-spruce successional sequence is the most common \nover  Siberia  (Pastor  et  al.  1999).  Coniferous  species  are  the  dominant  species \nthroughout Siberia. Larch is the main species in Central Siberia, followed by pine and \ndeciduous species (mainly birch) (Table 1).\n5\n2.2. Data\nThe main dataset used in this study is Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer\n(MODIS)\/Terra fAPAR 1km 8-day composites produced at Boston University \n(MOD15_BU fAPAR), which is a variant of the MODIS\/Terra LAI\/fAPAR product\n(MOD15A2, Collection 4. The standard MODIS\/Terra product is called LAI\/FPAR). A \nbug  was  found  in  the  code  generating  Collection  4  MOD15A2  fAPAR  product \n(MOD15_BU product 2005). In the operational code, a '+' was written to '-', so fAPAR \nunder diffuse radiation was produced instead of fAPAR under direct solar radiation, as \nrequired  by the  product  specifications.  Therefore,  the  imagery  used  in  this  study is \nMOD15_BU fAPAR which is reprocessed MOD15A2 with a corrected direct radiation \nregime and meets  the requirements  of the MOD15A2 fAPAR product specifications \n(Knyazikhin  et al. 1999). A total of 184 images were collected for the period January \n2001 to December 2004.\nThe MODIS\/Terra sensor acquires global daily morning satellite images on 36 \nspectral  bands,  seven  of  which  are  designed  for  the  study  of  vegetation  and  land \nsurfaces:  blue (459\u2013479 nm),  green (545\u2013565 nm),  red (620\u2013670 nm),  near infrared \n(NIR: 841\u2013875 nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR1: 1230\u20131250 nm, SWIR2: 1628\u2013\n1652  nm,  SWIR3:  2105\u20132155  nm).  Daily  global  imagery  is  provided  at  spatial \nresolutions of 250 m (red and NIR) and 500 m (blue, green, SWIR1, SWIR2, SWIR3). \nThe MOD15_BU fAPAR product is a 1 km global data product updated once every 8-\ndays, selecting the highest-quality maximum fAPAR value recorded in that period. It \nmeasures  the  proportion  of  available  radiation  in  the  photosynthetically  active \nwavelengths  (400  to  700  nm)  that  a  vegetation  canopy  absorbs.  The  MOD15_BU \nretrievals are performed using a three-dimensional radiative transfer algorithm (Myneni \net al. 2002), which uses a look-up table (LUT) approach (Knyazikhin  et al. 1998) to \ncalculate  the  most  probable  values  of  fAPAR  for  each  pixel.  It  uses  as  inputs \natmospherically  corrected  Bidirectional  Reflectance  Factor  (BRF)  for  each  MODIS \nband (MOD09 Surface Reflectance), band uncertainties, sun-view geometries, and the \nMODIS Land Cover type product (MOD12Q1).\nWe used the Forest Disturbance Map (FDM), produced in the framework of the \nEU funded project Siberia-II (Schmullius and Hese 2002, Balzter et al. 2005), to select \nburned areas according to two criteria (see Section 2.3 Selection of test sites). The FDM \nis a GIS vector database which is provided in Albers Conical Equal Area projection \nwith a pixel size of 926.625 m. The FDM was produced by George et al. (2006) and is \nbased  on  MODIS\/Terra  Nadir  BRDF-Adjusted  Reflectance  16-day  composites \n(MOD43B4) (Schaaf et al. 2002) acquired for the summers 2001, 2002 and 2003. Two \ndifferent  approaches  were  used  to  identify  the  FDM  burned  areas.  Approach  one \nidentifies  land  areas  which  were  burned in  the  same year  of  image acquisition  and \ninvolved  implementing  a  NDVI  differencing  technique  (Kasiscke  et  al.  1993). \nApproach  two  identifies  disturbances  created  up  to  ten  years  prior  to  the  image \nacquisition date and involved using the NDSWIR (Normalised Difference ShortWave \nInfraRed index) (Gerard et al. 2003). A land cover map was needed in the production of \nthe FDM to  provide  a  baseline  showing the forest  extent  back  to  1992.  The IGBP \nDISCover land cover map derived from 1992 and 1993 AVHRR imagery  (Loveland et  \nal. 2000) was used to exclude the non-woody areas and hotspot (thermal anomalies) \ninformation was used to date the burned areas.\nThe GLC2000 Land Cover Map (GLC2000) was used to select burned area \npolygons as a function of their forest type (see section 2.3). GLC2000 was derived from \n6\nSPOT4-VEGETATION data divided in two time-windows as follows: from March to \nNovember  of  year  1999 to  produce  the  land  cover  classification,  and  from June to \nAugust of year 2000 for the burned area class updating (Bartalev et al. 2003a).\n2.3. Selection of test sites\nThe aim was to build up a four year time series of fAPAR, starting with year 2001, with \n2002 being the year of the fire. As post-fire dynamics depend on the interval of fire \nrecurrence, sites affected by recurrent fires in a short period of time will have a different \nbehaviour than those affected by a single fire. So sites which burned in year 2002 (first \ncriteria) and which did not burn any other time in the period from 1992 to 2003 either \nwholly or partially  (second criteria)  were selected.  Finally,  only sites  dominated  by \nevergreen  needle-leaf  (ENL),  deciduous  needle-leaf  (DNL)  or  deciduous  broadleaf \n(DBL), as defined by GLC2000, were selected (Table 2) because these forest types are \ncommon in the study area. Distinguishing between forest types is important because of \ntheir  different  adaptations  to  fire  (Wirth  2005;  Table  1)  and  because  physiological \ndifferences in assimilation rates, carbon allocation, and nutrient use efficiency influence \nCO2 uptake  during  photosynthesis  (Larcher  1980).  For  example,  model  sensitivity \nanalyses for 21 forest stands showed that uncertainty in leaf area index (LAI), which is \nused to calculate fAPAR, can cause net canopy assimilation to be in error by up to \n42-70% depending on forest types (Bonan 1993). Publications referring to\/dealing with \nthe estimation of forest type specific fAPAR uncertainty have not been found. The first \ntwo criteria rely on information available from the FDM and the third criteria on the \nGLC2000. Only test sites dominated at least by 75% of the forest types under study \nwere selected. The final number of test sites fulfilling the three criteria was fourteen: six \nfor ENL, five for DNL and three for DBL (Figure 2; Table 3).\nFor each of the fourteen burned areas an undisturbed adjacent unburned control \nplot was selected representing the same forest type. The control plots were introduced to \nhelp separate inter-annual fAPAR variations caused by local climate from changes in \nfAPAR behaviour due to a burn. For a valid comparison, the control plot must have \ncharacteristics similar in terms of area covered, forest type and climatic conditions to \nthe burned area which it is paired with. The GLC2000 map was used to ensure the \ncontrol  plots  were  taken  from the  same  forest  type.  Climatic  conditions  were  kept \nsimilar by minimising the distance between the burned area and its control plot. The \ndistance between the burned area and control plot ranged from 2 km to 9 km. The FDM \nand thermal anomalies data were used to verify that the control plots did not burn in the \nprevious twelve years. To isolate patterns attributed to latitude the selected test sites \nwere grouped into three 5\u00b0 latitudinal bands from 51\u00b0 to 65\u00b0N.\n2.4. MOD15_BU fAPAR time series analysis\nThe time-series analysis of fAPAR was conducted for each burned area and control plot \nwith the aim of providing aggregated estimates of change (Slayback et al. 2003) and to \ntest for statistical significance. The pre-fire year, 2001, was used to assess the adequacy \nof the selected unburned control plots. To evaluate the post-fire response of the different \nforest types and latitudinal regions several variables were used:\n\u2022 The mean of 8-day fAPAR for each burned area and its associated control plot \nwas calculated to visually examine the seasonal patterns of individual burns. An \nexample is provided in Figure 3.\n\u2022 The mean and standard deviation of annual fAPAR were derived according to \nforest type, disturbance status (i.e. burned or control) and latitudinal region.\n7\n\u2022 \u0394fAPAR was calculated as the difference between the mean annual fAPAR of \nthe burned areas and the mean annual fAPAR of their associated control plots \ngrouped according to forest type and latitudinal region.\nA repeated-measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with a between subjects-\nfactors design was used to evaluate the effect of the factors forest type and latitudinal \nband  on  \u0394fAPAR  calculated  for  the  three  years  from  the  year  2002  of  the  fires. \nRepeated measures designs are those that contain a sequence of observations of each \nsubject (i.e. three years of \u0394fAPAR observations for the burned areas). In this kind of \ndesign there is more than one source of variability, in this case in burned area according \nto forest type, latitude and from year to year (Everitt 1995). The assumptions made in \nthis analysis are that there are correlations between forest type and time, and between \nlatitude and time and that the data satisfy the 'circularity' property. This means that the \nvariance  of  the  difference  between  measurements  at  different  times  (i.e.  years)  is \nconstant. Because the fAPAR values were analysed over several years at the same forest \nstand polygons, a repeated measures design is an appropriate ANOVA model. In this \nmodel the random variation between repeated fAPAR observations within one polygon \nis assumed to be lower than new polygons randomly selected each year. The model for \nthe repeated measures analysis of variance was defined as\n\u0394fAPARijk = \u03bc + \u03b1i + \u03b2j + (\u03b1\u03b2)ij + \u03c9ij + \u03b3k + (\u03b1\u03b3)ik + (\u03b2\u03b3)jk + (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3)ijk + \u03b5ijk\nwhere  \u0394fAPARijk is the difference between fAPAR of a pair of burned and unburned \nforest polygons; \u03bc is the overall mean; \u03b1i is the forest type effect; \u03b2j is the latitude effect; \n(\u03b1\u03b2)ij are forest type\/latitude interactions; \u03c9ij is the between-polygon pair error term; \u03b3k \nis the time effect (year) within polygon pairs; (\u03b1\u03b3)ik are forest type\/time interactions; \n(\u03b2\u03b3)jk are latitude\/time interactions; (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3)ijk are forest type\/latitude\/time interactions and \n\u03b5ijk is the within-polygon-pair error term.\nUsing the  statistical analysis of the two between-subjects factors (forest type \nand latitude) and the repeated factor (time) we tested if there are differences in \u0394fAPAR \namong the three forest types, among the three latitudinal regions and along time. We \nalso tested if significant interactions exist between forest type and latitude; forest type \nand time; latitude and time; and forest type, latitude and time. The null hypothesis was \nin all cases that \u0394fAPAR does not differ among the forest types, the latitudinal regions \nor along time and that the interactions were not significant.\nThe ANOVA will only establish whether there are any significant differences \non \u0394fAPAR within the studied factors (forest type, latitude or time) or whether there are \nsignificant  interactions  among  the  factors.  A  multiple  group  comparison,  i.e.  the \nBonferroni correction, was applied to isolate where significant differences exist between \npairs. This method ensures that the overall type I error is controlled (Everitt 1995).\n3. Results\nWe assessed the adequacy of the selected unburned control plots by comparing their \npre-fire  fAPAR  values  with  those  of  the  burned  areas.  A  one-way  ANOVA  test \nindicated that there were not significant differences between burned areas and control \nplots for the different forest types the year before the fire. Due to the use of control plots \nit  was  possible  to  account  for  the  influence  of  inter-annual  variability  and  other \nenvironmental factors captured in these unburned areas (Goetz et al. 2006) (Figure 3).\n8\nAnnual mean fAPAR for the burned areas and control plots grouped in terms \nof forest types and latitudinal bands are shown in Figures 3 and 4 respectively for the \nthree years of observation. Fire effects on fAPAR are evident for the ENL forest type \nwhile there is little or no effect for the DBL forest type. The standard deviation (error \nbars) indicates that the variation in the measurements is higher for the ENL and DNL \nforest types than for the DBL forest type. When grouped according to latitude a clear \npattern can be observed of increasing fAPAR with decreasing latitude, and the effects of \nfire  on  fAPAR  are  evident  for  every  latitudinal  region  (Figure  5).  The  standard \ndeviation  indicates  that  the  variation  in  the  measurements  is  higher  for  the  lower \nlatitudinal region than for the upper and middle latitudinal regions.\n\u0394fAPAR in Table 4 quantifies the change in fAPAR undergone after fire by the \ndifferent forest types. The ENL forest type is the most affected by fire experiencing a \ndecrease in fAPAR of 0.096 the year of the fire (2002), which represents a 23.6 % drop \nin  the mean  annual  fAPAR with respect  to  the control  plots.  The  DNL forest  type \nexperienced a decrease in fAPAR of 0.042 and the DBL forests a decrease of 0.01 \nrepresenting a 16.3% and 3.3% drop in mean annual fAPAR with respect to the control \nplots,  respectively.  The  relative  difference  in  \u0394fAPAR  (%\u0394fAPAR)  between  forest \ntypes  is  maintained  in  the  subsequent  years.  Table  4  also  shows  \u0394fAPAR grouped \naccording to latitudinal region. fAPAR decreases in all latitudinal bands, but no clear \npatterns can be seen except that in the lower latitudes  \u0394fAPAR appears to be slightly \nlarger and to vary less with time.\nThe results of the ANOVA analysis are shown in Table 5. The small p-value \nassociated with forest type (p < 0.01) indicates that there are significant differences in \n\u0394fAPAR among the three forest types, i.e. the magnitude of the drop in fAPAR after \nfire depends on forest type, and hence the factor forest type plays the most important \nrole in explaining the differences between the means in \u0394fAPAR. Further analyses were \ndone to test whether significant differences between the different levels of the factor \nforest type exist. Figure 6 shows the results of the Bonferroni test carried out on the \nfactor  forest  type.  The  mean  \u0394fAPAR  for  the  DNL  and  DBL  forest  types  differs \nsignificantly from the ENL forest type.\nThe  results  of  the  ANOVA  analysis  also  indicate  that  \u0394fAPAR  is  not \nsignificantly different among the three latitudinal regions. Another important result is \nthat there are significant interactions between forest type and latitude (p < 0.05). This \nmeans  that  the  effects  of  forest  type  on  \u0394fAPAR  also  depends  on  latitude.  This \ninteraction between forest type and latitude could not be studied further because of the \nlack of all combinations since not all the forest types were present in all the latitudinal \nregions (e.g. the DBL forest type is not present in the upper latitudinal region).  Also, \n\u0394fAPAR is not significantly different for the three years of observations (p > 0.05), and \nthere  are  no  significant  interactions  between  the  two  main  factors  (forest  type  and \nlatitude) and time. This implies that for at least the first two years after a fire \u0394fAPAR \ndoes not change. \n4. Discussion\nDue to  the  harsh  climate  conditions  regeneration  in  the  boreal  forest  is  very slow; \nburned areas can take 60-100 years to regenerate to mature forests (Schulze et al. 2005). \nWe observed a  difference  of  MODIS fAPAR between latitudinal  regions,  namely a \ndecrease in annual fAPAR with increasing latitude, which is due to the shortening of the \ngrowing season towards the north, and decreasing vegetation activity.\n9\nSatellite-derived fAPAR has not been used in previous published studies of \nforest regeneration after fire, since fAPAR is mainly seen as an intermediate variable \nfor  calculation  of  net  primary  production  (Myneni  et  al.  2003).  However,  we  can \ncompare the fAPAR results with previous studies of NPP. Whether NPP for different \nboreal forest types differs and in which direction is subject to dispute in the literature. \nSchulze  et al. (1999) reported the same annual NPP values for ENL and DNL boreal \nforests (NPP = 123 gC m-2 y-1), while Lloyd (1999) found that NPP was higher for the \nDBL (228 gC m-2 y-1) than for the ENL forest type (120 gC m-2 y-1). Yet, Potter  et al. \n(1993) found higher values for ENL forest (226 gC m-2 y-1) than for DNL forest (153 gC \nm-2 y-1).  These  estimates  were  calculated  using  different  forest  types,  study regions \n(boreal  North  America,  Europe,  Asia),  and  stand  ages,  which  is  the  most  likely \nexplanation for the observed differences.\nOur results from the analysis  of MODIS fAPAR data suggest that the three \nforest  types  included  in  the  analysis  differ  in  their  fAPAR  activity  and  show \ncharacteristic  fAPAR trajectories  in the first  few years  following the fire.  The ENL \nforest type has the highest mean annual fAPAR, followed by the DBL and the DNL \nforest types (Fig. 4). Post-fire fAPAR is most strongly affected in the ENL forest type \n(Figure 4, Table 4) followed by the DNL forest type, with no apparent change for the \nDBL forest type. This is partially confirmed by the statistical results showing significant \ndifferences in \u0394fAPAR between the ENL and the two deciduous forest types (DBL and \nDNL) (Figure 6). These results confirm the suggested link between fire intensity and \nforest type: broad-leaved deciduous species tend to sustain fires of lower intensity than \nneedle-leaved species (Dyrness et al. 1986). The finding that fAPAR of the ENL forest \ntype is more affected by fire than that of the DNL forest type is thought to be related to \nthe fact that larch (Larix  sp.), a deciduous needle-leaf species commonly found in the \nstudy area, is less conductive for intense crown fires because it forms relatively open \npure stands which lack understory fuels (Soja  et al. 2004), which are associated with \nhigh  severity  in  boreal  forests  (Cumming  2001).  Another  explanation  for  this \nphenomenon might be that P. sylvestris, which is the main ENL forest type in the study \narea, occurs on edaphically drier sites more prone to fire than typical larch sites with \nmore fine-textured soils and underlying permafrost (Wirth 2005). Moreover, pine stands \nare more prone to crown fires than deciduous forests. The later usually attain surface \nfires and only under extreme weather conditions will be affected by crown fires (Rowe \nand Scotter 1973, Van Wagner 1983).\nThe  temporal  dynamics  of  \u0394fAPAR either  for  the  different  forest  types  or \nlatitudinal  regions  show  little  difference  and  variability  (Table  4).  Moreover,  the \nANOVA test (Table 5) indicates that time is not a significant factor and that there are no \ninteractions between time and the two main factors (forest type and latitude). These two \nfacts may indicate that the \u0394fAPAR caused by fire remains almost constant during the \ninitial years following a fire. For the year 2002, when the fires happened, the annual \nfAPAR  is  composed  of  an  average  of  both  pre-  and  post-fire  measurements.  The \ninability to detect significant \u0394fAPAR differences between 2002 and 2003 suggests that \nin most cases the fires took place at the beginning of the summer or that the areas were \naffected by low severity fires.\nSome methodological considerations should be discussed in more detail. First, \nthere are uncertainties in the calculation of fAPAR. The MODIS Land Cover product \n(MOD12Q1) is used to define the canopy radiation regime of the six biomes included in \nthe calculation of fAPAR: grasses and cereal crops, shrubs, broadleaf crops, savannas, \nbroadleaf forests, and needle-leaf forests. Biome misclassification in the MODIS land \ncover map is likely to introduce errors in the derived fAPAR, which may affect  the \n10\nanalysis  of  fAPAR  time-series.  Second,  the  ratio  of  direct  to  total  incident  solar \nradiation (FDIR) is a very important variable in calculating fAPAR and changes with \natmospheric conditions. Aerosols and clouds affect the FDIR and thus fAPAR. MODIS \nfAPAR is calculated assuming that the incident solar radiation consists solely of direct \nbeam  radiation.  This  assumption,  together  with  the  limitations  in  the  atmospheric \ncorrection procedure used for MODIS data, is likely to produce some uncertainties in \nthe  MODIS  fAPAR  (Tian  et  al.  2004).  This  includes  the  potential  of  noise \ncontamination of the fAPAR time series due to cloud effects during some acquisitions \nsince no filtering was done to minimize such effects. Third, the GLC2000 land cover \nmap used to identify the forest types of the burned areas and their control plots contains \nboth classification and aggregation errors like all classified maps. It is difficult to assess \nthe classification accuracy of pixels classified using satellite data over large areas due to \nthe high structural and compositional variability within biomes (Xiao and Moody 2004). \nFor example, a comparison of GLC2000 used in this analysis with the Swansea land \ncover map of Siberia based on MODIS imagery of 2002 (Skinner and Luckman 2004) \nhighlighted  confusion  between  broadleaf  forest  and  cropland.  These  disagreements \ncould be caused by (i) genuine land cover changes, (ii) misclassification, or (iii) mis-\nregistration.  Seven  originally  selected  burned  areas  were  investigated  closer  by \ncomparing the GLC2000 and Swansea land cover map classes for the selected areas. \nFour of the seven burned areas classified as broadleaved forest by the GLC2000 map \nwere croplands or a mixture of other categories according to the Swansea land cover \nmap. Of the seven DBL sites originally selected based on GLC2000, three remained \nafter checking their land cover with Landsat TM imagery. Finally, we have to critically \ndiscuss why post-fire annual fAPAR values are greater than zero. A contributing factor \nis the coarse resolution of the satellite data together with the comparatively small size of \nsome  of  the  burned areas.  In  fact,  seven  of  the  fourteen  selected  burned  areas  are \nsmaller than 20 pixels (<20 km2), containing a high number of boundary pixels which \nare likely to represent a mixture of burned and unburned vegetation. Thus, the fAPAR \ndecrease  following  a  fire  is  underestimated  because  of  mixed  burned\/unburned \nboundary pixels and potential remaining patches of unburned trees in the centre of the \nfire scar. When selecting the burned areas the main constraint was found to be the pre-\nwildfire  forest  type.  Most of the burned areas are  smaller  than 20km2 because only \nburned  areas  containing  more  than  75%  of  one  of  the  selected  forest  types  were \nselected. Bigger burned areas usually contain several land cover types.  Within our 3.2 \nmillion km\u00b2 study area we did not have enough large burned areas (i.e. sample size too \nsmall)  representative of the forest types under study.  Also although the larger study \nareas might appear more attractive, the problem with those is that they often contain \npockets of surviving forest which do not always appear on the burned area product.\nThe study presented here is the first analysis of post-fire fAPAR time-series \ndata  from  MODIS.  The  main  results  suggest  that  (i)  the  forest  types  exhibit \ncharacteristic fAPAR change trajectories shortly after the fire, (ii) the differences are \nrelated  to  the  leaf  habit,  deciduous  or  evergreen,  (iii)  fAPAR  changes  are  not \nsignificantly  different  among  the  latitudinal  regions,  and  (iv)  the  small  variability \nobserved among the three years of observations indicates that fAPAR varies very little \nin the first years following a fire.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Ranga Myneni and Wenze Yang from Boston University for re-processing\nand providing the MOD15_BU fAPAR data set.
