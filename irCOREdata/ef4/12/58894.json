Implicitly or explicitly, information provided by both monitoring and \nmodelling must be extrapolated in order to have wider scientific and policy utility. In many \ncases, large-scale modelling utilises little of the data available from long-term monitoring, \ninstead relying on simplified models and limited, often highly uncertain, data for \nparameterisation. Here, we propose a new approach whereby outputs from model \napplications to long-term monitoring sites are upscaled to the wider landscape using a simple \nstatistical method. For the 22 lakes and streams of the UK Acid Waters Monitoring Network \n(AWMN), standardised concentrations (Z scores) for Acid Neutralising Capacity (ANC), \ndissolved organic carbon, nitrate and sulphate show high temporal coherence among sites. \nThis coherence permits annual mean solute concentrations at a new site to be predicted by \nback-transforming Z scores derived from observations or model applications at other sites. \nThe approach requires limited observational data for the new site, such as annual mean \nestimates from two synoptic surveys. Several illustrative applications of the method suggest \nthat it is effective at predicting long-term ANC change in upland surface waters, and may \nhave wider application. Because it is possible to parameterise and constrain more \nsophisticated models with data from intensively monitored sites, the extrapolation of model \noutputs to policy relevant scales using this approach could provide a more robust, and less \ncomputationally demanding, alternative to the application of simple generalised models using \nextrapolated input data. \n \nKeywords: Modelling, Long-term monitoring, Catchments, Upscaling, Acid Neutralising \nCapacity, Dissolved Organic Carbon, Sulphate, Nitrate \nIntroduction \n \nHeadwater catchments incorporate a major proportion of the total stream length of many river \nsystems (Bishop et al., 2008), and are intimately linked to the landscapes they drain. \nMonitoring in headwater systems thus provides a uniquely long-term insight into the \nbiogeochemical and ecological processes that govern natural ecosystems, their condition, and \ntheir response to anthropogenically imposed change. Long-term monitoring is, however, \nchallenging to maintain in the face of uncertain funding, changing policy priorities, and \nreliance on the sustained commitment of small numbers of individuals (Nisbet, 2007). While \nthe importance of monitoring is increasingly recognised by scientists and policymakers, there \nis often little connection between information obtained from detailed catchment studies, and \nthe whole-landscape (national or international) scale at which policy decisions must be taken. \nThis problem is accentuated where catchment studies have developed on an individual, ad \nhoc basis, often at scientifically interesting but atypical locations, and without consistency of \nmeasurements or methods between sites. Recognition of this issue has led, in some countries, \nto the establishment of centrally coordinated national monitoring networks. In the UK, 22 \nexisting and new monitoring catchments were combined into the UK Acid Waters \nMonitoring Network (Monteith and Evans, 2005), with standardised measurements and \nprotocols, consistent sampling dates, and centralised analyses providing a greater degree of \nrepresentivity and comparability (Patrick et al, 1991). Similar networks have been established \nin other countries, such as the 14 sites of the GEOMON network in the Czech Republic \n(Fottov\u00e1, 1995). At the international level, data from sites within national monitoring \nprogrammes have been combined into international programmes, with the aim of providing \nscientific support to decision-making at this scale. For example, the UNECE Convention on \nLong-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP, Sliggers and Kakebeeke, 2004), which \nis responsible for international agreements to abate atmospheric sulphur, nitrogen, ozone and \nparticulates, established a number of International Cooperative Programmes (ICPs) to collate \nnational monitoring data, including (for catchments) the ICP on Integrated Monitoring and \nICP Waters (e.g. Skjelkv\u00e5le et al., 2005).  \n \nDespite these drives towards integration and aggregation of monitoring, the gap between \nmonitoring and decision-making remains. Taking both the UK and CLRTAP examples, \ndecisions on pollution abatement are ultimately made on the basis of mapped estimates of \necosystem sensitivity and exposure to damaging pollutant levels. These are derived from \ncalculated (static) critical loads models, or more recently from dynamic biogeochemical \nmodels (Hettelingh et al., 2008). In either case, the approach used is to combine limited \nmeasurement data with extrapolated parameter values, and then to apply the model to very \nlarge numbers of locations. In the UK, for example, freshwater critical loads are calculated \nfor 1752 surface waters where a chemical measurement exists, and terrestrial critical loads \nare calculated for 1-8 habitats within approximately 240,000 1 km grid squares, based on \ndefault parameter sets (Hall et al., 2004). Dynamic model applications have followed the \nsame general structure, using the MAGIC model (Cosby et al., 2001) for surface waters, and \nthe VSD model (Posch and Reinds, 2009) for soils.  \n \nThus, policy decisions are made based on very limited and often highly extrapolated input \nparameters for critical loads or dynamic models. Opportunities for evaluating predictions \nagainst observations are limited, and even where (as for surface water MAGIC simulations) \nmodels have been calibrated against observations, these are often single time points (e.g. \nfrom synoptic surveys), so that it is not possible to gauge whether the simulated trajectory of \nhistoric change adequately reproduces observations. \n \nIn this context, long-term monitoring performs several roles. Firstly, intensive catchment \nstudies have in many cases provided the process insight and detailed measurements to \nsupport model development (e.g. Cosby et al., 1985; Tipping, 1996; Gbondo-Tugbawa et al., \n2001). Secondly, they have been used to test the outputs from models applied at large spatial \nscales against the small subset of sites with long-term observations (e.g. Forsius et al., 1998; \nJenkins et al., 2001; Ouhlehle et al., 2007; Reinds et al., 2009). Thirdly, monitoring sites have \nbeen used to undertake more complex simulations, for example incorporating additional \nenvironmental drivers and scenarios for land management and climate (e.g. Evans, 2005; \nBeier et al, 2003; Aherne et al., 2008; Sj\u00f8eng et al., 2009; Futter et al., 2009); detailed carbon \nand nitrogen cycles (e.g. Belyazid et al., 2006; Futter et al., 2009); and more sophisticated \nmethods for parameter and uncertainty estimation such as Bayesian calibration (Larssen et \nal., 2007; Reinds et al., 2008). While much of this work has appeared in the scientific \nliterature, and may indirectly have supported the development and application of models at \nlarger scales, the higher data demands of more complex model applications preclude their \nparameterisation to a wider set of data-poor locations. In other words, there is currently little \ndirect linkage between the detailed time series datasets obtained from catchment monitoring \nstudies, and the simplified catchment models that ultimately underpin national and \ninternational-level policy development. \n \nWe propose that this disconnection between small-scale monitoring and large-scale \nmodelling could potentially be removed, via an alternative approach to the use of monitoring \ndata in models. Rather than attempt to use monitoring data to estimate the parameters of \ndetailed process models, recent approaches have empirically related monitoring data to \nsimple readily available regional scale data, such as catchment characteristics (Cooper et al., \n2004). Simple relationships between water quality and landscape class have then been used \nfor spatial extrapolation. This approach relies on the spatial coherence of hydrochemical \nresponse for locations with the same landscape. A similar approach may be taken to temporal \ninterpolation; just as hydrochemical conditions are dependent on spatially varying catchment \ncharacteristics, they are also dependent on temporally varying external drivers such as \nclimate and deposition. Long term monitoring datasets provide local measurements of \ntemporal variability over time, but extrapolation to regional scales represents a significant \nchallenge. \n \nSince critical loads based methods to support pollution abatement policies first evolved in the \n1980s, long-term monitoring datasets have increased greatly in number and duration. \nFurthermore, comparisons of these datasets have often shown remarkable temporal coherence \namong sites across wide gradients of geographical location, catchment characteristics, \nexposure to air pollutants, climate and land management (Evans and Monteith, 2001; \nWatmough et al, 2004; Davies et al., 2005; Monteith et al., 2007). The implication is that \nheadwater catchments are responding in a consistent fashion to a set of external \nenvironmental drivers, whose effect can be inferred from responses even if not explicitly \nidentified. Here, we utilise this observed temporal coherence as the basis of a method for \nanalysing and predicting chemical change at one site, based on observed change at other sites. \nWe then extend this approach, in order to extrapolate modelled changes from a small number \nof monitoring sites to predict changes at unmonitored sites, as an alternative to modelling \nthese sites directly. We present examples of the application of this approach, discuss its \nadvantages and disadvantages compared to direct modelling, and consider its potential utility \nfor upscaling from a limited set of monitoring catchments to larger and more policy-relevant \nspatial scales.  \n \nMethods \n \nSite description \n \nWe based our study on the 22 catchments of the UK Acid Waters Monitoring Network \n(AWMN, Figure 1). The network comprises 11 lakes and 11 streams, distributed across \nupland areas of the UK, which was initiated in 1988. The sites span a wide range of \nanthropogenic and marine ion deposition, land cover (5 catchments contain plantation conifer \nforest, the remainder comprise acid grassland and\/or heathland and blanket bog), soil type \n(including peats, podzols, gleys and rankers), climate (range of mean temperatures 3 to 10 \nC, mean annual rainfall 0.87 to 3.5 m), and topographic position (altitude of sampling site 10 \nto 785 m) (Patrick et al., 1991; Monteith and Evans, 2000). Lakes are sampled at a consistent \nquarterly frequency, and streams monthly to reflect their greater short-term variability. \nAnalyses follow strict protocols to ensure intra- and inter-site comparability (Patrick et al, \n1991) and have been subjected to rigorous analytical quality control comparisons (Gardner, \n2008). All samples are now analysed at either the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, \nLancaster, or at the Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory, Pitlochry. Analysis is based on 19 years \nof full chemical data, from 1989 to 2007. \n \nTime series standardisation \n \nPrevious time series analyses of the AWMN dataset (e.g. Evans and Monteith, 2001; Davies \net al., 2005) have shown that, despite substantial differences in the mean and variance of most \nchemical variables between sites, underlying patterns of temporal variation in rescaled (or \nstandardised) data often show strong similarities. To demonstrate these underlying patterns, \nmeasured concentrations at each sampling site s and date t (\nstC ) were standardised over time, \nby subtracting the site mean for the whole time series (\nsC ) and dividing by the site standard \ndeviation (\ns\n) so that  \n \n \n( )st s\nst\ns\nC C\nZ  (1) \n            \nThe time series of standardised concentrations (\nstZ referred to as \u2018Z scores\u2019) thus has a mean \nof zero and a standard deviation of 1. Exploratory analysis suggests that this standardisation \nleads to new series which show temporal consistency following an approximate model  \n \n \nst t stZ x  (2) \n \nwhere \ntx is a temporal effect which is independent of location and st is a zero mean \nuncorrelated error term with variance independent of both location and time. Such a model \nimplies that temporal effects are essentially multiplicative, so that sites with generally high \nconcentrations will tend to have high variability over time in absolute but not in relative \nterms. This effect is to some extent moderated by the presence of a sample mean in the \ndefinition of the standardised variable. \n \nThe behaviour of \ntx might be further modelled as, for example \n \n \nt tx a bt  (3) \n \nEquation (3) might be appropriate if the time effect were following a linear trend. The \ncombination of equations (2) and (3) constitutes a hierarchical linear model which could be \nformally analysed as such. The model description presented here is intended to provide a \ngeneral view of methodology, rather than focusing on a detailed statistical analysis. For this \nstudy, we simplified the chemical time series further, by first taking an annual mean of all \nsamples collected within each year (so that t in equation (2) represents years), and then \nundertaking the standardisation procedure as above based on annual rather than individual \nsample values. The resulting time series of annual mean Z scores permits direct comparison \nbetween quarterly-sampled lakes and monthly-sampled streams, and is directly comparable to \nthe annual time step at which many biogeochemical models, such as MAGIC and VSD, \ntypically operate.  \n \nFinally, we calculated median annual Z scores for each year across a set of sites (either the all \nsites, or a defined subset). Again, this approach was used previously by Evans and Monteith \n(2001) and Davies et al. (2005), but based on individual sampling dates and for lake and \nstream subsets. 10\nth\n and 90\nth\n percentile Z scores were also calculated, providing evidence of \nthe stability of the variance of \nst\n between years.  \n \nFor this study, we focused on a key water quality variable, Acid Neutralising Capacity \n(ANC), which is widely used for modelling and monitoring assessments. While alternative \nformulations exist, the preferred method for calculating ANC in the AWMN is based on \nmeasured (Gran) alkalinity (Alk), inorganic Al concentration (Alinorg) and an estimate organic \nacid concentration (OA) based on a conversion from dissolved organic carbon (DOC) \nconcentration (Evans et al., 2001; Equation (4)). \n \n inorgANC =  Gran Alkalinity + OA - Al  (4) \n    \nThe same methodology was also applied to calculate Z scores for DOC, sulphate (SO4), and \nnitrate (NO3). Median annual Z scores were calculated for all 22 AWMN sites, and for \nsubsets of lakes\/streams, and moorland\/forest catchments.  \n \nExtrapolating from monitored to unmonitored sites \n \nThe fundamental assumption in extrapolating to a new site is that it follows a coherent \ntemporal pattern to another site, or set of sites as indicated in equation (2). The time series of \nZ scores for this site, or group median Z score for a set of sites, can thus be directly back-\ntransformed to give estimates of \nstC  for the new site according to equation (5), and following \nthe notation of equation (1). \n \n ( )st st s sC Z C  (5) \n \nIn the case that \nsC  and s are known, this calculation is straightforward (where Z scores are \ncalculated for annual mean data, \nsC and s  are the mean and standard deviation of the annual \nmeans, rather than the raw data). At most unmonitored sites, however, it is unlikely that these \nstatistics will be known, and they must therefore be estimated At many sites in the UK \nFreshwater Critical Loads dataset, water quality data exist from two or more separate time \npoints: for example, the Welsh Acid Water Survey of over 100 surface waters was repeated in \n1985 and 1995 (Stevens et al 1997), while a set of 48 lochs in Galloway, Southwest Scotland, \nhas been sampled on seven occasions between 1979 and 1998 (Ferrier et al. 2001). For sites \nsuch as these for which \nstC  and stZ are available at two or more time points 1 2, ,...t t t  a \nsequence of equations of type (5) can be used to solve for \nsC  and s , either using two \nsimultaneous equations, or statistically. We examined heuristically whether we could \naccurately predict long-term ANC mean and standard deviation from samples collected at \ntwo time points based on the AWMN sites. In general, we found that a good estimate of long-\nterm mean could be obtained from the mean of any two sampling years (e.g. Figure 2a, for \nthe years 2007 and 1992), and that a reasonable estimate of the standard deviation could be \nobtained from a regression of the variance against the squared difference between the two \nsamples (e.g. Figure 2b). We assumed that the regression equations obtained by this method \nwere applicable to other sites where samples had been collected in the same years. \n \nExtrapolating from modelled to unmodelled sites \n \nThe method described permits the extrapolation of measured water quality data from a \nmonitored site to a site at which two sets of synoptic survey data are available. In principle, \nthe same approach may be applied to modelled data, by substituting measured annual means \nwith output values from a biogeochemical model applied to the monitored site. The potential \nadvantages of this approach over direct application of the same model to the unmonitored site \nare i) that data rich monitoring sites can support a more accurate and\/or sophisticated model \nparameterisation, and ii) that model outputs can be tested or constrained (e.g. Larssen et al., \n2007) against observed time series, rather than simply calibrated to a single point in time. \n \nFor this study, we undertook two illustrative model output extrapolations based on previous, \nwell-parameterised and tested applications of the MAGIC model to monitoring sites. For the \nfirst example, we used a calibration of MAGIC to the Afon Gwy, a Mid-Wales stream that \nhas been monitored by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology since 1980. MAGIC was \napplied with a two soil layer structure, detailed parameterisation using local measurements, \nand calibration against both soil solution and stream chemical data (Evans et al., 2008). \nOutputs from the model were used to predict ANC change at Llyn Llagi, an AWMN lake \ncatchment located 65 km to the north, in the Snowdonia region of North Wales. Predicted \nANC changes at Llyn Llagi were compared both to observations from the site, and to \npredictions from a simpler direct calibration of MAGIC to Llyn Llagi as part of a regional \nsuite of MAGIC applications. This application was based on a single soil layer, \nparameterisation data extrapolated from national or regional datasets and calibration to a \nsingle year of water chemistry data (Evans et al., 2007). \n \nSecondly, we took a recent two soil layer calibration of MAGIC to the River Etherow \ncatchment in the South Pennines, England (Helliwell et al., in prep.) and used this to predict \nANC change for a suite of 27 sites within the region which were sampled in 1998 (Evans et \nal, 2000) and again in 2001-02 (Helliwell et al., 2007). Predictions were again compared \nagainst direct MAGIC simulations to all sites, which formed part of the regional model \napplication described above. \n \nResults \n \nStandardised annual time series \n \nUntransformed annual mean ANC, SO4, NO3 and DOC time series for the individual AWMN \nsites (Figure 3) highlight the extent of between-site heterogeneity in terms of mean \nconcentrations, rates of change, and short-term variability. Standardisation, on the other hand \n(Figure 4), highlights the degree of underlying temporal coherence across the network. For \nSO4, there was a very pronounced decline in concentrations during the late 1990s, and high \ncoherence between sites (mean annual 10\nth\n-90\nth\n percentile range 1.03 standardised units). \nANC showed a consistent increase, with the fastest rate of change coinciding with the period \nof SO4 decrease, and a reasonable level of coherence (mean 10\nth\n-90\nth\n percentile range 1.54). \nIn contrast, there has been no clear trend in NO3 concentrations, and relatively high \nvariability among sites (mean 10\nth\n-90\nth\n percentile range 2.04). However, all sites showed a \nclear NO3 peak in 1996. DOC has increased at all sites, with low variability between sites \n(mean 10\nth\n-90\nth\n percentile range 1.25). There was some indication of a reversal in the rising \ntrend from 2001-04, but concentrations subsequently rose to unprecedented levels during \n2006-07. \n \nTo a large extent, these observations reinforce previous inferences from analyses of monthly \nstream and quarterly lake data, namely that reduced S inputs to UK upland surface waters \nhave led to a large reduction in runoff SO4 concentrations, partial recovery from acidification \nas evidenced by rising ANC (e.g. Davies et al., 2005), and an apparently associated increase \nin the leaching of DOC (e.g. Evans et al., 2006). Temporal variations in NO3 leaching appear \nto be mainly linked to climate fluctuations, such as occurrence of soil freezing, rather than \ndirectly to deposition (Monteith et al., 2000; Cooper, 2005). The relatively low temporal \ncoherence in NO3 between sites suggests that local factors such as land-management (notably \ntree maturation, felling and replanting in forested catchments), as well as N saturation status, \nmay also have influenced NO3 leaching. \n \nReducing time series to annual mean values tends to highlight underlying trends rather than \nshort-term variations, particularly for streams (cf. Figure 1 of Davies et al. 2005). It also \npermits direct comparisons among sites sampled at different frequencies, and between \ndifferent site types. Here, we compared lakes and streams, and forested and moorland \ncatchments. Studies in North American and Scandinavian lakes have shown a substantial role \nof lakes in the processing of carbon and nutrients (e.g. Dillon and Molot, 2005; Algesten et \nal., 2003). UK lakes in high rainfall upland areas typically have shorter residence times than \nthose in continental areas, and here their impact on long-term trends is less clear. On the other \nhand, there is strong evidence that catchment afforestation of parts ot the UK (primarily \nexotic conifer plantation on moorland during the post-war period) significantly amplified the \neffects of acid deposition, due to increased base cation uptake and pollutant scavenging from \nthe atmosphere by the forest canopy (NEGTAP , 2001). Evidence of intensified current \ndamage has led to predictions that afforested catchments may not respond to reduced acid \ndeposition in the same way as moorland catchments, resulting in suppressed recovery or even \nongoing acidification (e.g. Jenkins et al., 1990; Helliwell et al., 2001). \n \nOur analysis shows, for all variables analysed, a tight correlation between median annual Z \nscores for the two pairs of catchment subsets (Figure 5). No clear deviation is apparent \nbetween ANC Z scores for forested and moorland catchments that might support the \nconclusion that forests are stopping recovery from acidification. However, because Z scores \ndo not permit comparison of the magnitude of change at individual sites, this observation \ndoes not exclude the possibility that moorland and forest catchments are recovering at \ndifferent rates. Similarly, neither the presence of lakes or forests appears to have influenced \nthe trajectory of DOC or NO3 leaching, although differences in rate of change again cannot \nbe discounted on this basis alone. Overall, the data do not support the subdivision of the \nAWMN sites according to catchment or surface water type. We were also unable to detect \nsufficient evidence of geographical clustering in the pattern of Z score variations to justify \nsubdividing data into regional subgroups (see below).  \n \nExtrapolating from monitored to unmonitored sites \n \nBased on the analysis above, suggesting no strong geographic or typological clustering of Z \nscore variations among the sites, we henceforth treated all AWMN sites as a single group. \nFor ANC, we then attempted to predict annual ANC concentrations at each site, based on \nback-transformation of median annual Z scores for the remaining 21 sites. Equation (5) was \napplied, firstly based on known mean and standard deviation values, and then on values \nestimated from only two years of data, 1992 and 2007 (Figure 2).  \n \nPredictions of ANC based on known mean and standard deviation had root mean square error \n(RMSE) values ranging from 3.3 to 22.6 eq l\n-1\n (Figures 6,7). With the exception of the few \nsites showing little overall ANC trend (e.g. Loch Coire nan Arr, Narrator Brook), annual \nANC predictions captured the underlying trend at most sites. The method was most \nsuccessful at capturing inter-annual trends at sites in Southwest Scotland (Round Loch of \nGlenhead, Loch Grannoch, Dargall Lane), Northwest England (Scoat Tarn, Burnmoor Tarn), \nNorth Wales (Llyn Llagi) and the Eastern part of Northern Ireland (Beaghs Burn, Bencrom \nRiver). These sites, all of which are clustered around the Irish Sea (Figure 1), show \nparticularly coherent behaviour and thus dominate the median Z score calculation for the \ndataset as a whole. Prediction of inter-annual variations becomes poorer with distance from \nthis central cluster, as might be expected given the increasing heterogeneity of short-term \nclimatic and depositional patterns across larger spatial scales. We were unable to identify \nother clear regional clusters, although it is likely that these would emerge given additional \nmonitoring datasets in (for example) Northern Scotland or Southern England. \n \nThe second method, in which mean and standard deviation were estimated from two \nobservation years, provides a more meaningful test of the utility of this method for \nextrapolating from monitored to unmonitored sites. ANC predictions based on 1992 and 2007 \n\u2018survey\u2019 years (Figure 6) resulted in only small increases in RMSE at most sites (Figure 7). \nWith few exceptions, this method thus remained effective in reproducing the trend in annual \nmean ANC. \n Extrapolating from modelled to unmodelled sites \n \nUpscaling to a single site: For the Llyn Llagi AWMN site, ANC was modelled directly in \nMAGIC based on regional-scale parameter data (Figure 8a), and indirectly based on annual Z \nscores derived from a site-specific MAGIC application to the Afon Gwy (Figure 8b), which \nwere back-transformed using known (Figure 8c) and estimated (Figure 8d) mean and \nstandard deviation values. The direct regional MAGIC application to Llyn Llagi captures the \napproximate trend in ANC, but (since the model application did not incorporate short-term \nvariations in driving variables) does not reproduce the short-term variation. RMSE over the \nperiod of observations is 7.0 eq l\n-1\n. Modelling the site indirectly using the Z score approach \ngave no discernable reduction in model performance (RMSE 7.3 and 6.4 eq l\n-1\n based on \nknown and estimated mean and standard deviation respectively), and appeared to capture \nboth the trend and some of the between-year variation in ANC. Comparing long-term \nsimulations, the indirect simulations suggest a slightly greater responsiveness of the site to \nchanging atmospheric deposition, with pre-industrial 1850 ANC values of around 70 eq l\n-1\n \ncompared to 56 eq l\n-1\n in the direct application, and forecast 2050 ANC of around 45 eq l\n-1\n \ncompared to 37 eq l\n-1 \nin the direct application.  \n \nUpscaling to multiple sites: Simulated ANC for the South Pennine reservoirs is shown in \nFigure 9, modelled directly by mutliple MAGIC applications to all sites, and indirectly by Z \nscore transformation from a single site-specific MAGIC application to the River Etherow \nAWMN site. Agreement between the two modelling methods is generally good, apart from at \nthe 1970 peak of acid deposition, when the indirect simulation suggests a greater degree of \nacidification. Without historic data against which to compare, the relative accuracy of the two \nhindcast simulations cannot be evaluated. However in forecast, it is notable that the two \nsimulations converge; for 2050, median predicted ANC for the regional dataset is 51 eq l\n-1\n \nbased on the Z score approach (11 sites having ANC below the critical limit of 20 eq l\n-1\n), \ncompared to a median of 57 eq l\n-1\n based direct MAGIC application (9 sites with ANC < 20 \neq l\n-1\n). Thus, in this example, the two methods would lead to similar interpretation of future \nregional water quality status. \n \nDiscussion \n \nDespite considerable typological and geographical variation, the 22 AWMN sites show high \ntemporal coherence in a range of key water quality variables, including SO4, DOC, ANC and \n- to a lesser extent - NO3. Standardisation of data to annual mean Z scores appears to be an \neffective method for comparing the behaviour of sites with contrasting absolute \nconcentrations, short-term variability and sampling frequency. Applications of this approach \ninclude comparison and differentiation of sites according to typology or location, potentially \nproviding insight into the processes controlling water quality variation across the landscape. \nOur analysis suggested little differentiation in water quality variations between sites \naccording to catchment type; we found no impact of lake presence on long-term DOC \nvariations, or of plantation forests on ANC variations. The Z score approach also has \npotential utility for identifying individual sites showing atypical behaviour (e.g. due to local \nmanagement or pollution factors), and for identifying individual analytical outliers. The \nmethod has been tested here on data from semi-natural upland ecosystems, and it is doubtful \nwhether the same approach would be as effective in more heterogeneous agricultural or \nurban-influenced areas, where diffuse and point-source pollution are likely to be more \ncatchment-specific. Nevertheless, analysis of temporal coherence in these systems might help \nin the identification of underlying signals, such as from climate or large-scale land-\nmanagement change, which may not be discernable from the analysis of individual sites. \n \nThere are several prerequisites to using the Z score approach for model upscaling. Firstly, it \nis vital that long-term monitoring data are available for a sufficient number of sites to identify \ntemporal coherence, derive average Z scores, and to allow subdivision according to \ntypological or geographical factors where these lead to differing biogeochemical behaviour. \nThis is greatly facilitated by consistently operated networks such as the AWMN, although by \nreducing data to annual means it may be possible to combine data from independently \noperated sites and\/or multiple networks. Secondly, the method will only be applicable for \nareas or ecosystems within which coherent behaviour can be demonstrated; it will become \nprogressively poorer with increasing geographical distance, or typological difference, from \nthe sites used to calculate median Z scores. Thirdly, to predict change at an unmonitored site \nit is necessary to have sufficient measurements from which to estimate long-term solute \nconcentration means and standard deviations for that site. In this study, we were able to \nderive reasonable estimates of both parameters from two years of \u2018survey\u2019 data, a minimum \ndata requirement likely to be available for large numbers of surface waters. Finally, long-term \nbiogeochemical model simulations are required for representative sites in order to derive \nrepresentative Z scores.  \n \nIn this respect, this modelling approach has significant potential advantages over previous \nlarge-scale biogeochemical model applications, which have in general involved repeated \nmodel application to large numbers of individual sites (e.g. Evans et al., 1998; Moldan et al., \n2004; Wright et al., 2005; Chen and Driscoll, 2005; Hettelingh et al., 2008). At the regional \nand national scale, modelling inevitably has to be undertaken using relatively simple models, \nparameterised with limited and\/or extrapolated input data, and making little or no use of \navailable long-term datasets. On the other hand, if biogeochemical variations are coherent \nacross a range of sites, it may be possible to obtain a more accurate simulation of long-term \nchange by extrapolating outputs from more detailed model applications at the smaller number \nof sites for which direct measurements are available. While the examples in this study were \nbased on two soil layer site-based MAGIC applications, the upscaling method described \ncould equally be based on models with more sophisticated process representations, for \nexample taking account of climatic variations. Where long-term data are available, this \napproach could be combined with modelling techniques such as Bayesian parameter \nestimation (Larssen et al., 2005; Reinds at al., 2008) which can be used to constrain \nsimulations, and to generate uncertainty ranges on future predictions.  \n \nA number of caveats apply to these conclusions. Firstly, in the method presented, individual \nwater quality variables can only be extrapolated individually. If applied to the full suite of \ndissolved solutes, this would not ensure maintenance of charge balance constraints. \nExtrapolation to new (survey) sites also assumes that these sites are comparable to those for \nwhich long-term data exist, and caution is therefore required to ensure that upscaling is \nrestricted to sites with similar catchment characteristics, and within a reasonable geographical \nrange. Outputs from highly complex site-specific models, for example those that integrate \nbiogeochemical processes with vegetation competition and succession (e.g. Wamelink et al., \n2009) are unlikely to be appropriate for upscaling using this method. Finally, application of \nthe method in the current study has been limited to a small number of illustrative examples, \nand more rigorous testing is required prior to larger-scale application. Nevertheless, given \nclear evidence of coherence in biogeochemical trends, we believe that there are significant \npotential advantages in terms of both model performance and computational time \nrequirement, in extrapolating outputs from a smaller number of more detailed model \napplications to monitoring sites, compared with extrapolating inputs in order to run simple \nmodels at a larger number of poorly characterised sites. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis study was supported by the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, under \nContract AQ0801.
