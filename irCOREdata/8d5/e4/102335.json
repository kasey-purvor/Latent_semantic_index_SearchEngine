Better electron confinement is expected, because of the much larger conduction band \noffset and because wide-bandgap AlGaAs can be used to form the cladding regions. This both reduces \ncarrier leakage and improves optical waveguiding. Most importantly, it also makes possible the \nfabrication of highly reflecting Bragg stacks and hence the production of 1 . 3 ~  wavelength vertical- \ncavity surface-emitting lasers for use in metro-area optical fibre communication. \nIn this paper we will describe investigations of the influence of the growth temperature of the \nactive region on the magnitude of the main recombination mechanisms at lasing threshold of 1.3pm \nsingle quantum-well (SQW) GaInNAdGaAs lasers grown by MBE. The laser structures used in this \nstudy are GaInNAs based SQW devices grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on n'- GaAs \nsubstrates. The GaInNAs QWs have an In-content of about 30%, an N-content of about 1.6% and a \nwidth of 6.5 nm. Two nominally identical series were grown with the only difference being the \ngrowth temperature of the active region,T,, which was set to be 422\u00b0C and 456\u00b0C respectively. \n. \n(a) \n1000 \n800 \n!7 \nE \n2600 \n$ \ns \n2 \nE400 \nU \n200 \n0 \n;1-] \nJAuger \n1 Tgmrrch = 422OC Tgmrrch = 456OC 800 \n600 3 \nI t  \nI L 1  \nA U \n\/ I  \n100 150 200 250 300 100 150 200 250 300 \nT [KI f [KI \nFigure 1 Current densities for the three main recombination processes versus temperature. \nIn figure 1 the current density (solid line), J&, for an active region growth temperature T, = 422\u00b0C (a) \nand T, = 456\u00b0C (b) is plotted as a function of device temperature. Around room temperature (T=290K) \nwe observe that Jth - 970 A\/cmz for the low T, lasers, while Jth - 330 A\/cm2 for the higher T, devices. \nTo determine which recombination processes are mainly responsible for this nearly factor 3 reduction \nin J& we utilize a method, successfully applied before, which enables the experimental determination \nof the monomolecular-, radiative- and Auger-related current contributions to the threshold current by \nstudying the integrated spontaneous emission rate from a window milled into the n-contact of the \n0-7803-8627-2\/04\/$20.0002004 IEEE 85 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Here the straight line \nmonomolecular current, which for a QW \ncan be deduced to be To (Imono) = 2\/3 T \nprocess for a two dimensional electron \ngas. It can be seen that for temperatures \nassuming a simple free carrier capture \nbelow -1 80 K, the To for the low T, laser \n(closed circles) follows closely the \ntheoretical line for pure monomolecular \nincrease leading to an increasing temperature sensitivity of Jth. This is reflected in the drop of To \n(closed circles) for temperatures P 1 8 0 K  in figure 2. For the high T, laser, To (open circles) is slightly \nlarger for T480K. This is again consistent with the findings from figure lb as the defect related \ncontribution is less dominant and the lower temperature sensitivity of the radiative component (To=T \nfor an ideal QW) increases the overall To. For T>180K the Auger current in figure lb  increases, \nleading to a drop of TO (open circles) in figure 2. It can be clearly observed that To is decreasing much \nmore strongly for the high T, laser (open circles) than for the low T, device (closed circles), leading to \na cross over point at about 230K. Close to room temperature (280K) we find To(422\"C) = 95K and \nTo(456\"C) = 77K. The lower To of the high T, laser is consistent with the higher relative Auger \ncontribution (-45% for 456\u00b0C and -30% for 422\u00b0C ) to Jth due to lower defect related recombination. \nFor Auger dominated threshold currents To < T\/3. \nAn interesting observation was made when comparing SQW and MQW lasers with nominally \nidentical QWs. As expected when decreasing nh, due to the larger modal gain the Auger current (-n3) \nis reduced relatively to the radiative current (-n2) when going from one to three wells However, the \nmonomolecular contribution (-n) is reduced by approximately the same amount as the Auger \ncomponent, which cannot be explained by a reduction in nth alone but requires a further decrease in the \ncoefficient A. The origin of this surprising effect is subject of ongoing investigations. \nI \n. \n[l] FEHSE, R, TOMIC, S., A D A M S ,  A.R., SWEENEY, S.J., O'REILLY, E.P., ANDREEV, A., RIECHERT, ' \nH., J. of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics, Vo1.9, No.4, Jul\/Aug 2002 \n86 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.
