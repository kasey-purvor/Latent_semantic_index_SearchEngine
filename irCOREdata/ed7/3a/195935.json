This is a very intricate\nissue. Admittedly, he can form a subjective probabilistic assessment and play a best\nresponse to his assessment. However, any subjective assessment is largely arbitrary, and\nthere is no obvious reasons to favor one assessment over another. Bayesian theory is silent\non how to form initial probabilistic assessments. Moreover, experimental evidence such\nas the Ellsberg paradox suggests that individuals frequently experience difficulties in\nforming a unique assessment. In this note, we postulate that \u201cregret\u201d guides individuals\nin forming probabilistic assessments and, ultimately, in making choices. Specifically,\nwe consider the concept of \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium as the solution concept; this\nconcept was initially introduced by Renou and Schlag (2009).\nIn an \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium, each player believes that his opponents are\nplaying according to the equilibrium strategies with probability 1\u2212 \u03b5, and is completely\nuncertain about the play of his opponents, otherwise. Whenever uncertain about the play\nof his opponents, a player conjectures that his opponents would play so as to maximize\nhis regret. In particular, there is no mutual belief in rationality in an \u03b5-minimax regret\nequilibrium (unless \u03b5 = 0). Intuitively, if a player believes with probability one that\nhis opponents are rational, he must conclude that his opponents will not play strictly\ndominated strategies. However, this might contradict the conjecture that his opponents\naim at maximizing his regret with probability \u03b5: strictly dominated strategies might\nmaximize his regret. The parameter \u03b5 thus captures the extent to which players are\ndoubtful about the rationality of others: the higher \u03b5 is, the more doubtful a player is.\nYet, we stress that players do not play strictly dominated strategies in an \u03b5-minimax\nregret equilibrium: players are rational. They might play weakly dominated strategies,\nhowever. (See example G3 in Renou and Schlag (2009).1)\nWe show that the social choice correspondences that are Maskin monotonic and sat-\nisfy the no-veto power condition are implementable in \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium for\nany \u03b5 < 1 (provided that there are at least three players). Perhaps surprising, this\n1In a pure \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium, players do not play weakly dominated strategies, however.\n2\nresult states that even arbitrarily large uncertainties about the rationality of others does\nnot undermine the implementation of social correspondences that are Maskin monotonic\nand satisfy no-veto power. We also show that Maskin monotonicity is not a necessary\ncondition for implementation in \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium, even when implementa-\ntion is required for all \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1). A larger set of social choice correspondences can be\nimplemented.\nFor excellent surveys on implementation theory, we refer the reader to Jackson (2001)\nand Maskin and Sjo\u00a8stro\u00a8m (2002). A closely related contribution to our work is Tumen-\nnasan (2008), who studies the problem of implementation in quantal response equi-\nlibrium. The distinctive feature of this solution concept is that players make errors\nin evaluating their payoffs and, thus, may play sub-optimal strategies. Tumennasan\nmakes, however, two additional and key assumptions. Firstly, he considers limiting\nquantal response equilibrium, i.e., as the probability of errors goes to zero. Secondly,\nhe requires each limiting quantal response equilibrium to be a strict Nash equilibrium.\nThese two additional assumptions makes the problem of implementation in quantal re-\nsponse equilibrium essentially equivalent to the problem of implementation in strict Nash\nequilibria. He shows that quasi-monotonicity together with a condition termed no-worst\nalternatives are necessary and almost sufficient conditions for implementation.2 Quasi-\nmonotonicity and Maskin monotonicity do not imply each others. Unlike Tumennasan,\nwe do not refine the set of \u03b5-minimax regret equilibria and, in fact, show that neither\nMaskin monotonicity nor quasi-monotonicity are necessary conditions for implementa-\ntion in \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium.\n2 Preliminaries\nAn environment is a triplet \u3008N,X,\u0398\u3009 where N := {1, . . . , n} is a set of n players, X a\nfinite set of alternatives, and \u0398 a finite set of states of the world. For each player i \u2208 N ,\nthere is a Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function ui : X \u00d7\u0398\u2192 R.\nWe denote by Li(x, \u03b8) := {y \u2208 X : ui(x, \u03b8) \u2265 ui(y, \u03b8)} player i\u2019s lower contour set of\nx at state \u03b8.\n2For sufficiency, he also needs the no-veto power condition. For the problem of implementation in\nstrict Nash equilibrium, Cabrales and Serrano (2008) show that quasi-monotonicity and the condition\nof no-worst alternatives are necessary and almost sufficient conditions.\n3\nA social choice correspondence f : \u0398 \u2192 2X \\ {\u2205} associates with each state of\nthe world \u03b8 a non-empty subset of alternatives f(\u03b8) \u2286 X. Two classic conditions for\nNash implementation are Maskin monotonicity and no-veto power. A social choice\ncorrespondence f is Maskin monotonic if for all (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u2032) in X \u00d7 \u0398\u00d7 \u0398 with x \u2208 f(\u03b8),\nwe have x \u2208 f(\u03b8\u2032) whenever Li(x, \u03b8) \u2286 Li(x, \u03b8\n\u2032) for all i \u2208 N . Maskin monotonicity is a\nnecessary condition for Nash implementation. A social choice correspondence f satisfies\nno-veto power if for all \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398, we have x \u2208 f(\u03b8) whenever x \u2208 argmaxx\u2032\u2208X ui(x\n\u2032, \u03b8) for\nall but at most one player i \u2208 N . Maskin monotonicity and no-veto power are sufficient\nconditions for Nash implementation (if n \u2265 3). Denote FNE the set of social choice\ncorrespondences that are Maskin monotonic and satisfies the no-veto power condition.\nA mechanism (or game form) is a pair \u3008(Mi)i\u2208N , g\u3009 with Mi the set of messages of\nplayer i, and g : \u00d7i\u2208NMi \u2192 X the allocation rule. Let M := \u00d7j\u2208NMj and M\u2212i :=\n\u00d7j\u2208N\\{i}Mj , with m and m\u2212i generic elements, respectively.\nA mechanism \u3008(Mi)i\u2208N , g\u3009 together with a state \u03b8 induce a strategic-form game G(\u03b8)\nas follows. There is a set N of n players. The set of pure actions of player i is Mi, and\nplayer i\u2019s payoff when he plays mi and his opponents play m\u2212i is ui(g(mi, m\u2212i), \u03b8). Let\n\u03a3i be the set of mixed strategies of player i and denote \u03a3\u2212i := \u00d7j\u2208N\\{i}\u03a3j , with generic\nelements \u03c3i and \u03c3\u2212i, respectively.\nThe aim of this paper is to study the problem of full implementation when players\nbehave according to the solution concept of \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium (Renou and\nSchlag (2009)). Before defining our solution concept, we wish to stress that the concern\nfor minimizing maximal regret does not arise from any behavioral or emotional consider-\nations. Rather, it is a consequence of relaxing some of the axioms of subjective expected\nutility (e.g., the axiom of independence to irrelevant alternatives); we refer the reader to\nHayashi (2008) or Stoye (2008) for recent axiomatizations. At state \u03b8, player i\u2019s ex-post\nregret ri((mi, m\u2212i), \u03b8) associated with the profile of messages (mi, m\u2212i) is given by\nri((mi, m\u2212i), \u03b8) = sup\nm\u2032\ni\n\u2208Mi\nui(g(m\n\u2032\ni, m\u2212i), \u03b8)\u2212 ui(g(mi, m\u2212i), \u03b8). (1)\nPlayer i\u2019s regret is thus the difference between player i\u2019s payoff when the profile of\nmessages (mi, m\u2212i) is played and the highest payoff he would have got, had he known that\nhis opponents were playing m\u2212i. With a slight abuse of notation, we write ri((\u03c3i, \u03c3\u2212i), \u03b8)\nfor the expected regret when the profile (\u03c3i, \u03c3\u2212i) of mixed strategies is played. A profile\n4\nof strategies (\u03c3\u2217i , \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i) is an \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium of the game G(\u03b8) if\n(1\u2212 \u03b5)ri((\u03c3\n\u2217\ni , \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i), \u03b8) + \u03b5 sup\n\u03c3\u2212i\u2208\u03a3\u2212i\nri((\u03c3\n\u2217\ni , \u03c3\u2212i), \u03b8) \u2264\n(1\u2212 \u03b5)ri((\u03c3\n\u2032\ni, \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i), \u03b8) + \u03b5 sup\n\u03c3\u2212i\u2208\u03a3\u2212i\nri((\u03c3\n\u2032\ni, \u03c3\u2212i), \u03b8)\nfor all \u03c3\u2032i \u2208 \u03a3i, for all i \u2208 N .\nLet us briefly comment on our solution concept. In an \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium\n(\u03c3\u2217i , \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i), player i believes that his opponents are playing \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b5\nand is completely uncertain about the play of his opponents, otherwise. And whenever\nuncertain about the play of his opponents, player i conjectures that his opponents play\nso as to maximize his regret. In particular, this implies that there is no mutual belief in\nrationality (unless \u03b5 = 0). To see this, suppose that there are only two players, 1 and\n2, that player 2 has a strictly dominant action and player 1 believes with probability\none that player 2 is rational. Since player 1 is certain that player 2 is rational, player\n1 must conjecture that player 2 plays his strictly dominant action with probability\none. However, the strictly dominant action of player 2 might not coincide with the\naction that maximizes player 1\u2019s regret. According to our solution concept, player 1\nmight therefore conjecture that player 2 plays a strictly dominated action with strictly\npositive probability (at most \u03b5, however), a contradiction with his belief about player 2\u2019s\nrationality. (See Example 1.) The parameter \u03b5 quantifies the beliefs in rationality: the\nhigher \u03b5, the more doubtful a player is about the rationality of his opponents. Similarly,\nthere is no common belief in conjectures (unless \u03b5 = 0). Two additional remarks are in\norder. Firstly, the concept of \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium with \u03b5 = 0 coincides with\nthe concept of Nash equilibrium. Secondly, if \u03b5 = 1, there is no strategic consideration:\na player simply minimizes his maximal regret, without making inferences about the play\nof his opponents, given his knowledge of their payoffs and the fact that they minimize\nmaximal regret. We refer the reader to Renou and Schlag (2009) for additional results.\nDefinition 1 Fix \u03b5 \u2208 [0, 1]. The mechanism \u3008(Mi)i\u2208N , g\u3009 implements the social choice\ncorrespondence f in \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium if for all \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398, the following two\nconditions hold:\n(i) For each x \u2208 f(\u03b8), there exists an \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium m\u2217 of G(\u03b8) such\nthat g(m\u2217) = x.\n5\n(ii) If \u03c3 is an \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium of G(\u03b8), then g(m) \u2208 f(\u03b8) for all m in the\nsupport of \u03c3.\nBefore proceeding, it is important to note that our definition of implementation\nin \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium follows Maskin (1999)\u2019s definition and, in particular,\nconsiders mixed strategies in part (ii). This contrasts with most of the literature on\nNash implementation: with the notable exceptions of Maskin (1999) and Mezzetti and\nRenou (2010), mixed strategies are not considered in this literature.3 With the concept\nof \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium, however, it is fundamental to consider mixed strategies:\nunlike the concept of Nash equilibrium, a player might be indifferent between two pure\nactions and yet strictly prefers a mixture of the two over each one.4 We now illustrate\nour concept of implementation in \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium with the help of a simple\nexample.\nExample 1. There are two players, 1 and 2, two states of the world, \u03b8 and \u03b8\u2032, and\nfour alternatives, a, b, c, and d. The utilities are represented in the table below. For\ninstance, at state \u03b8, player 1\u2019s payoff of a is 10, while player 2\u2019s payoff is 2.\n\u03b8 \u03b8\u2032\n1 2 1 2\na 10 2 5 5\nb 4 5 1 0\nc 5 0 0 1\nd 5 1 0 0\nConsider the social choice function f with f(\u03b8) = d and f(\u03b8\u2032) = a. It is imple-\nmentable in Nash equilibrium (Maskin (1999)), as well as in rationalizable outcomes\n(Bergemann, Morris and Tercieux (2010)). A simple mechanism to implement f is the\nfollowing: each player i has two messages mi and m\n\u2032\ni, and the allocation rule is given in\nthe table below.\n3Note a substantial difference between Maskin (1999) and Mezzetti and Renou (2010): in part (i) of\nthe definition of implementation, Maskin does not consider mixed Nash equilibria, while Mezzetti and\nRenou do.\n4This follows from the axiomatization of the minimax regret criterion, which requires the uncertainty\naxiom. The uncertainty axiom says that if an individual is indifferent between two acts, he prefers a\nmixture of these acts over each of them. (See Stoye (2008).)\n6\nm2 m\n\u2032\n2\nm1 a b\nm\u2032\n1\nc d\nIn particular, at state \u03b8, the strategic-form game G(\u03b8) is:\nm2 m\n\u2032\n2\nm1 10, 2 4, 5\nm\u2032\n1\n5, 0 5, 1\nSo, if player 1 is certain that player 2 is rational, then (m\u2032\n1\n, m\u2032\n2\n) is the unique rationaliz-\nable outcome, hence the unique Nash equilibrium. Suppose now that player 1 has some\ndoubts about the rationality of player 2 and, thus, is not certain that player 2 plays\nhis strictly dominant action m\u2032\n2\n. Assume that player 1 believes that player 2 is rational\nwith probability 1\u2212\u03b5 and, thus, believes that player 2 plays m\u2032\n2\nwith probability at least\n1\u2212\u03b5. With probability \u03b5, player 1 is completely uncertain about the play of player 2 and\nconjectures that player 2 plays so as to maximize his (player 1) regret. We argue that\n(m\u2032\n1\n, m\u2032\n2\n) is nonetheless the unique \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium whenever \u03b5 is small\nenough.\nClearly, it is optimal for player 2 to play his strictly dominant action m\u2032\n2\n. Now, if\nplayer 1 considers playing m\u2032\n1\n, his maximal regret is 5\u03b5. With probability 1\u2212 \u03b5, player\n1 believes that player 2 is rational and thus plays m\u2032\n2\n, in which case m\u2032\n1\nis player 1\u2019s\nbest reply. With probability \u03b5, player 1 conjectures that player 2 maximizes his (player\n1) regret, and thus plays m2. In that case, m1 (and not m\n\u2032\n1\n) is the best reply, so that\nthe regret is 5.5 Alternatively, if player 1 considers playing m1, his maximal regret\nis 1. We might then conclude that m\u2032\n1\nminimizes player 1\u2019s maximal regret whenever\n\u03b5 \u2264 1\/5. However, if \u03b5 > 1\/6, player 1 can guarantee himself a maximal regret of\n5\/6 by randomizing between m1 and m\n\u2032\n1\nwith probability 5\/6 and 1\/6, respectively.\nIn other words, m1 is not a profitable deviation whenever 1\/5 > \u03b5 > 1\/6, but the\nrandomization between m1 and m\n\u2032\n1\nis; this highlights the importance of considering\nmixed strategies. In fact, (m\u2032\n1\n, m\u2032\n2\n) is the unique \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium whenever\n\u03b5 \u2264 1\/6.6 This simple example suggests that social choice correspondences that are\n5That is u1(g(m1,m2), \u03b8)\u2212 u1(g(m\n\u2032\n1,m2), \u03b8) = 5.\n6If \u03b5 > 1\/6, there is a unique \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium, in which player 1 plays m1 with\nprobability 5\/6 and player 2 plays m\u20322 with probability one.\n7\nMaskin monotonic and satisfies the no-veto power condition are implementable in \u03b5-\nminimax regret equilibrium whenever \u03b5 is small enough, i.e., whenever the doubt about\nthe rationality of others is small enough (with n \u2265 3). Surprisingly, this turns out to be\ntrue even for arbitrarily large \u03b5, i.e., for all \u03b5 < 1.\n3 Monotonicity and no-veto power\nThe main result of this note is that, in environments with at least three players, social\nchoice correspondences that are Maskin monotonic and satisfy the no-veto power con-\ndition are implementable in \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium for all \u03b5 \u2208 [0, 1). Maskin\u2019s\nresult is surprisingly robust: even arbitrarily large uncertainties about the rationality\nof opponents do not undermine the implementation of social choice correspondences in\nFNE.\nProposition 1 Let n \u2265 3. If the social choice correspondence f is Maskin monotonic\nand satisfies no-veto power, then it is implementable in \u03b5-minimax regret for all \u03b5 \u2208 [0, 1).\nThe intuition for Proposition 1 is simple. The canonical mechanism for Nash imple-\nmentation features an integer game, whereby whenever it is not the case that at least\nn\u22121 players announce the same message, the alternative implemented is the alternative\nnominated by the player announcing the highest integer (if there are several such play-\ners, choose the player with the lowest index). Consider now a profile of messages such\nthat the integer game applies. The regret to any player is then the difference in payoffs\nbetween his most preferred alternative and the alternative implemented. Indeed, had\nthe player known the integers of the others, he could have chosen a strictly higher integer\nand got his most preferred alternative. Clearly, his maximal regret is then the difference\nin payoffs between his most preferred alternative and his less preferred alternative. Fur-\nthermore, regardless of the strategy a player follows, his opponents can always trigger\nthe integer game and impose to the player his maximal regret. With probability \u03b5, the\nmaximal regret to a player is therefore constant and, consequently, only the regret of\nfacing rational opponents matters. In turn, this implies Nash behavior.\nProof Since f is Maskin monotonic and satisfies the no-veto power condition, it is\nimplementable in Nash equilibrium. In particular, the mechanism of Maskin and Sjo\u00a8tro\u00a8m\n(2002) implements f . The mechanism has the following distinctive feature: each player\n8\ni has to report an alternative xi, a state \u03b8i, an integer zi and a mapping \u03b1i : X\u00d7\u0398\u2192 X\nfrom alternatives and states to alternatives satisfying \u03b1i(x, \u03b8) \u2208 Li(x, \u03b8) for all (x, \u03b8).\nMoreover, under rule 3 of the mechanism, whenever it is not the case that at least\nn\u2212 1 players announce the same alternative x, the same state \u03b8 and the integer 1, the\nalternative implemented is the alternative announced by the player with the highest\ninteger (if there are several such players, choose the player with the lowest index): it is\nan integer game.\nWe claim that the maximal regret a player can experience is independent of the\nstrategy \u03c3i he plays. To see this, assume that the state of the world is \u03b8. Suppose that\nthe profile (mi, m\u2212i) is realized such that rule 3 applies, i.e., g((mi, m\u2212i)) = x\ni\u2217 with i\u2217\nthe player with the lowest index among the players announcing the highest integer. The\nregret to player i in state \u03b8 is therefore:\nmax\nx\u2208X\nui(x, \u03b8)\u2212 ui(g(mi, m\u2212i), \u03b8),\nsince player i can always get his most preferred alternative by announcing an integer\nstrictly higher than the ones of his opponents. Furthermore, by choosing m\u2212i such that\nat least one player other than i announces an integer higher that the one of player i\nand all players other than i announce the less preferred alternative of player i (i.e.,\nm\u2212i = (\u03b8\nj, \u03b1j, xj , zj)j\u2208N\\{i} with x\nj \u2208 minx\u2208X ui(x, \u03b8) for all j \u2208 N \\ {i} and z\nj > zi for\nat least two players j), the maximal regret to player i is\nmax\nx\u2208X\nui(x, \u03b8)\u2212min\nx\u2208X\nui(x, \u03b8) := Ki(\u03b8).\nIt then follows that for any \u03c3i, the supremum of the regret is attained in Ki(\u03b8). (It is\nactually a maximum whenever \u03c3i has a finite support. But no maximum exists when \u03c3i\nhas an unbounded support.)\nFinally, let (\u03c3\u2217i , \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i) be a Nash equilibrium of the mechanism at state \u03b8. Note that\nthis is equivalent to ri((\u03c3\n\u2217\ni , \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i), \u03b8) \u2264 ri((\u03c3i, \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i), \u03b8) for all \u03c3i \u2208 \u03a3i. It follows that\n(1\u2212 \u03b5)ri((\u03c3\n\u2217\ni , \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i), \u03b8) + \u03b5 sup\n\u03c3\u2212i\u2208\u03a3\u2212i\nri((\u03c3\n\u2217\ni , \u03c3\u2212i), \u03b8) =\n(1\u2212 \u03b5)ri((\u03c3\n\u2217\ni , \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i), \u03b8) + \u03b5Ki(\u03b8) \u2264\n(1\u2212 \u03b5)ri((\u03c3i, \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i), \u03b8) + \u03b5Ki(\u03b8) =\n(1\u2212 \u03b5)ri((\u03c3i, \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i), \u03b8) + \u03b5 sup\n\u03c3\u2212i\u2208\u03a3\u2212i\nri((\u03c3i, \u03c3\u2212i), \u03b8),\n9\nfor all \u03c3i \u2208 \u03a3i, so that (\u03c3\n\u2217\ni , \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i) is an \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium.\nConversely, if (\u03c3\u2217i , \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i) is not a Nash equilibrium, there exist a player i and a strategy\n\u03c3\u2032i such that ui((\u03c3\n\u2032\ni, \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i), \u03b8) > ui((\u03c3\n\u2217\ni , \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i), \u03b8), so that ri((\u03c3\n\u2217\ni , \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i), \u03b8) > ri((\u03c3\n\u2032\ni, \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i), \u03b8). It\nfollows from the above arguments that (\u03c3\u2217i , \u03c3\n\u2217\n\u2212i) is not an \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium\nprovided that \u03b5 < 1. This completes the proof. \u0003\nConversely, assume that the designer requires the implementation of a social choice\ncorrespondence for a large range of behaviors (parameterized by \u03b5), including Nash\nbehavior.7 Then, the social choice correspondence is Maskin monotonic. Maskin mono-\ntonicity is thus necessary and almost sufficient for implementation in \u03b5-minimax regret\nequilibrium for all \u03b5 \u2208 [0, 1).\n4 Discussion\nWe conclude this note with two remarks. Firstly, we show with the help of a simple\nexample that Maskin monotonicity is not a necessary condition for implementation in\n\u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium, even when implementation is required for all \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1).8\nExample 2. Consider an economy with a perfectly divisible good in fixed supply\nof one unit. There are three consumers in this economy. Consumers 1 and 2 have\nstrictly monotonic preferences, while consumer 3 has single-peaked preferences. In state\n\u03b8, consumer 3\u2019s preferences are single-peaked at 1\/2, while they are single-peaked at\n1\/3 in state \u03b8\u2032. In both states, consumer 3 strictly prefers a positive consumption\nover a zero consumption. The social planner aims to implement the allocation f(\u03b8) =\n{(1\/3, 1\/3, 1\/3)} at state \u03b8 and the allocation f(\u03b8\u2032) = {(1\/4, 1\/4, 1\/2)} at state \u03b8\u2032.\nThe social choice function f cannot be implemented in Nash equilibrium, since it fails\nMaskin monotonicity. Yet, the social choice function f is implementable in \u03b5-minimax\nregret equilibrium for all \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1): there is a discontinuity at \u03b5 = 0. To see this,\nconsider the following mechanism: Each consumer has to announce either a state \u03b8 or\n\u03b8\u2032, or an integer z. If all consumers announce a state, the allocation rule is as below:\n7After all, if the designer requires implementation for infinitesimal small \u03b5, why should he exclude\n\u03b5 = 0, i.e., Nash behavior?\n8The example is adapted from Sjo\u00a8tro\u00a8m (1994).\n10\n\u03b8 \u03b8\u2032\n\u03b8 1\/3, 1\/3, 1\/3 1\/3, 0, 1\/2\n\u03b8\u2032 0, 1\/3, 1\/2 0, 0, 1\/2\n\u03b8 \u03b8\u2032\n\u03b8 0, 0, 1\/3 0, 1\/3, 1\/3\n\u03b8\u2032 1\/3, 0, 1\/3 1\/4, 1\/4, 1\/2\n\u03b8 \u03b8\u2032\nAlternatively, if exactly one consumer announces an integer and the two others announce\na state, the allocation is the bundle (0, 1\/3, 0) if consumer 1 announces the integer,\n(1\/3, 0, 0) if consumer 2 announces the integer and (0, 0, 0) if consumer 3 announces the\ninteger. If two consumers or more announce an integer, the allocation is the bundle\n(1\/3, 0, 0) if consumer 1 announces a higher integer than consumer 2 or consumer 2\nannounces a state, and (0, 1\/3, 0) if consumer 2 announces a strictly higher integer than\nconsumer 1 or consumer 1 announces a state. Importantly, consumer 3 gets a zero\nallocation whenever at least one consumer does not announce a state.\nWe have to show that at state \u03b8 (resp., \u03b8\u2032), the profile of messages (\u03b8, \u03b8, \u03b8) (resp.,\n(\u03b8\u2032, \u03b8\u2032, \u03b8\u2032)) is the unique \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium for any \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1). Suppose that\nthe true state is \u03b8. We first argue that in any \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium at state \u03b8,\nconsumer 3 announces the true state \u03b8. To see this, observe that the message \u03b8 is weakly\ndominant at state \u03b8 for consumer 3 and, consequently, consumer 3\u2019s regret of playing \u03b8 is\nstrictly smaller (in fact, zero) than the regret of playing any other strategies, regardless\nof the strategies of consumers 1 and 2. We next argue that consumers 1 and 2\u2019s maximal\nregret is minimized at \u03b8 when consumer 3 announces the true state \u03b8 (with probability\n1\u2212 \u03b5). To see this, note that, conditional on consumer 3 announcing the true state, it\nis weakly dominant for consumers 1 and 2 to match the announcement of consumer 3.\nMoreover, the presence of an integer game between consumers 1 and 2 implies, as with\nProposition 1, that the maximal regret to consumer 1 (resp., consumer 2) when facing\n\u201cirrational\u201d opponents is independent of the strategy he plays. Consequently, (\u03b8, \u03b8, \u03b8) is\nthe unique \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium at state \u03b8. A similar reasoning applies at state\n\u03b8\u2032.9\nIn addition, it is worth noting that the social choice function f is implementable in\nundominated Nash equilibrium (Palfrey and Srivastava (1991), Jackson et al. (1994)\nand Sjo\u00a8tro\u00a8m (1994)). This suggests a possible connection between implementation in\n9The logic of this example can be generalized to show that, in separable environments (Jackson\net al. (1994)), any individually rational social choice function is implementable in \u03b5-minimax regret\nequilibrium for all \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1).\n11\n\u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium and in undominated Nash equilibrium (Palfrey and Sri-\nvastava (1991)). In particular, we conjecture that if a social choice correspondence is\nimplementable in \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium, then it is implementable in undomi-\nnated Nash equilibrium. Unfortunately, we have not been able to prove it. Nonetheless,\nthe following example due to Jackson (1992) shows that both concepts do not coincide.\nExample 3. There are five players, labeled 1 to 5, two states of the world \u03b8 and \u03b8\u2032\nand two alternatives x and y. The preferences are:\n\u03b8 \u03b8\u2032\n1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5\ny y x x y y y x x x\nx x y y x x x y y y\nThe social choice correspondence selects the less preferred alternative of player 5 at each\nstate, i.e., f(\u03b8) = {x} and f(\u03b8\u2032) = {y}. It is implementable in undominated Nash\nequilibrium, but not in \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium for any \u03b5. Assume by contraction\nthat f is implementable in \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium by the mechanism \u3008M, g\u3009. At\nstate \u03b8, there must exist a pure \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium m\u2217 with g(m\u2217) = x.\nWe argue that for m\u2217 to be a pure equilibrium, it must be that ui(g(m\n\u2217\ni , m\u2212i), \u03b8) \u2265\nui(g(mi, m\u2212i), \u03b8) for all mi, for all m\u2212i, for all i \u2208 {1, 2, 5}. Consider player 5. (A\nsimilar argument applies to players 1 and 2.) To the contrary, assume that there exists\na profile of messages (m\u2032\n5\n, m\u2032\u22125) such that g(m\n\u2217\n5\n, m\u2032\u22125) = x and g(m\n\u2032\n5\n, m\u2032\u22125) = y. That is,\nwe have the following configuration:\nm\u2217\u22125 m\n\u2032\n\u22125 . . .\nm\u2217\n5\nx x . . .\nm\u2032\n5\nx or y y . . .\n...\n...\n...\n. . .\nThe maximal regret of playing m\u2217\n5\nis therefore at least \u03b5(u5(y, \u03b8) \u2212 u5(x, \u03b8)). It is\n\u03b5(u5(y, \u03b8)\u2212 u5(x, \u03b8)) whenever g(m5, m\n\u2217\n\u22125) = x for all m5 \u2208M5, and u5(y, \u03b8)\u2212 u5(x, \u03b8),\notherwise. Clearly, if m\u2032\n5\nweakly dominates m\u2217\n5\n, m\u2217 cannot be an equilibrium. Similarly,\nifm\u2032\u22125 = m\n\u2217\n\u22125, m\n\u2217 cannot be an equilibrium: the regret of playing m\u2217\n5\nwould be u5(y, \u03b8)\u2212\nu5(x, \u03b8), while the regret of playing m\n\u2032\n5\nwould be at most \u03b5(u5(y, \u03b8)\u2212u5(x, \u03b8)). However,\n12\nif none of the previous holds, it has to be that the maximal regret of playing m\u2032\n5\nis the\nsame as playing m\u2217\n5\n, i.e., \u03b5(u5(y, \u03b8) \u2212 u5(x, \u03b8)). That is, we must have the following\nconfiguration:\nm\u2217\u22125 m\n\u2032\n\u22125 . . .\nm\u2217\n5\nx y . . .\nm\u2032\n5\ny x . . .\n...\n...\n...\n. . .\nPlayer 5 has therefore a profitable deviation: he can randomize between m\u2217\n5\nand m\u2032\n5\nand strictly decreases his maximal regret. A direct implication of the above result is\nthat g(m1, m2, m\n\u2217\n3\n, m\u2217\n4\n, m5) = x for all m1, for all m2, for all m5. Similarly, at state \u03b8\n\u2032,\nthere must exist a pure \u03b5-minimax regret equilibrium m\u2217\u2217 with g(m\u2217\u2217) = y. Following\nthe same logic as above, it follows that g(m\u2217\u2217\n1\n, m\u2217\u2217\n2\n, m3, m4, m5) = y for all m3, for all\nm4, for all m5, a contradiction.\nReferences\n[1] Dirk Bergemann, Stephen Morris and Olivier Tercieux, 2010, \u201cRationalizable Im-\nplementation,\u201d Mimeo, Yale University.\n[2] Antonio Cabrales and Roberto Serrano, 2008, Implementation in Adaptive Better-\nResponse Dynamics, Mimeo, Brown University.\n[3] Matthew O.
