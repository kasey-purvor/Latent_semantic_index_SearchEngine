Electrocardiograms (ECGs), respiration and electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded from two groups of 10 rats during the entire course of anaesthesia following the administration of a single bolus of ketamine\u2013xylazine (KX group) or pentobarbital (PB group). The phase dynamics approach was then used to extract the instantaneous frequencies of heart beat, respiration and slow \u03b4-waves (within 0.5\u20133.5 Hz). The amplitudes of \u03b4- and \u03b8-waves were analysed by use of a time\u2013frequency representation of the EEG signal within 0.5\u20137.5 Hz obtained by wavelet transformation, using the Morlet mother wavelet. For the KX group, where slow \u03b4-waves constituted the dominant spectral component, the Hilbert transform was applied to obtain the instantaneous \u03b4-frequency. The \u03b8-activity was spread over too wide a spectral range for its phase to be meaningfully defined. For both agents, we observed two distinct phases of anaesthesia, with a marked increase in \u03b8-wave activity occurring on passage from a deeper phase of anaesthesia to a shallower one. In other respects, the effects of the two anaesthetics were very different. For KX anaesthesia, the two phases were separated by a marked change in all three instantaneous frequencies: stable, deep, anaesthesia with small frequency variability was followed by a sharp transition to shallow anaesthesia with large frequency variability, lasting until the animal awoke. The transition occurred 16\u201376 min after injection of the anaesthetic, with simultaneous reduction in the \u03b4-wave amplitude. For PB anaesthesia, the two epochs were separated by the return of a positive response to the pinch test at 53\u201394 min, following which it took a further period of 45\u201370 min for the animal to awaken. \u03b4-Waves were not apparent at any stage of PB anaesthesia. We applied non-linear dynamics and information theory to seek evidence of causal relationships between the cardiac, respiratory and slow \u03b4-oscillations. We demonstrate that, for both groups, respiration drives the cardiac oscillator during deep anaesthesia. During shallow KX anaesthesia the direction either reverses, or the cardio-respiratory interaction becomes insignificant; in the deep phase, there is a unidirectional deterministic interaction of respiration with slow \u03b4-oscillations.
