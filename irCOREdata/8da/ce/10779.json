Year 8 and year 10 pupils gave accounts of how school made them feel. Thematic analysis of these accounts revealed positive and negative links between environment and well-being in schools. In particular, spaces such as the playground and places within school provided sites for bullying and exclusion, and at the same time friendship and belonging. Properties of spaces, such as the physical fabric of buildings and degrees of surveillance also influenced well being. Pupils exercised control over their environments largely through the breaking of what were considered petty and dis-empowering rules. The research indicates the powerful role of place in the emotional well-being of children at schools and suggests that the development of schools as emotionally \u2018restorative and healthy places\u2019 require a much fuller understanding of the person-environment relationship.<\/dc:description><dc:description>Paper presented to Open Space, People Space Conference, October 2004, Edinburgh.<\/dc:description><dc:date>2008-05-07T11:00:18Z<\/dc:date><dc:type>Presentation<\/dc:type><dc:identifier>http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2173\/24973<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.openspace.eca.ac.uk\/conference\/proceedings\/PDF\/sixsmith.pdf<\/dc:relation><\/oai_dc:dc><\/metadata><\/record>","journals":null,"language":null,"relations":["http:\/\/www.openspace.eca.ac.uk\/conference\/proceedings\/PDF\/sixsmith.pdf"],"year":2008,"topics":["Emotional well-being","Schools","Place"],"subject":["Presentation"],"fullText":""}
