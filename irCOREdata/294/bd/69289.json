Introduction 36 \nVolcanoes that have interacted with ice provide a valuable palaeo-environmental 37 \nrecord, as the nature of deposits formed (e.g. subglacial-subaerial transitions) may be 38 \nused to reconstruct approximate ice thicknesses (e.g. Smellie, 2000; Smellie, 2008; 39 \nSmellie et al., 2008). Indeed, as volcanic rocks are readily datable through radioactive 40 \ndecay series they may provide a unique opportunity to track the history of how ice 41 \nsheets have fluctuated during past global climate change (Smellie et al., 2008).  42 \n However, many subglacially erupted formations do not provide any clear 43 \nevidence for approximate ice surface elevations \u2013 especially those that erupted 44 \nentirely beneath the ice (e.g. Skilling, 1994; Tuffen et al., 2001; Dixon et al., 2002; 45 \nSchopka et al., 2006; McGarvie et al., 2007; Edwards et al., 2009). In these cases the 46 \npressure-dependent solubility of magmatic volatiles may potentially be used to 47 \nestimate palaeo-pressures at the eruption site, which may provide information on both 48 \npalaeo-ice thicknesses and the local subglacial hydrology. 49 \n The degassing of magmatic volatiles during subglacial eruptions (principally 50 \nH2O, CO2, S, F and Cl) may strongly influence eruptive mechanisms and associated 51 \nhazards, as is the case with subaerial eruptions (Sparks, 2003; Edmonds, 2008). 52 \nAdditionally, volatile degassing controls the emission of climate-affecting gases such 53 \nas CO2 and SO2 into the oceans and atmosphere (G\u00edslason et al., 2002; Edmonds, 54 \n2008). As melting of ice sheets may promote subglacial volcanic activity (Maclennan 55 \net al., 2002; Pagli and Sigmundsson, 2008) there is therefore scope for feedback 56 \nbetween climate change and patterns of subglacial volcanism (Huybers and Langmuir, 57 \n2009). 58 \n In this paper we present a critical overview of the use of volatile contents in 59 \nsubglacially erupted glasses to reconstruct palaeo-ice thicknesses. New data is 60 \n 4 \nprovided that highlights the strong heterogeneities in volatile contents within samples 61 \nthat may seriously hamper use of the technique. We then systematically outline the 62 \ncriteria that must be met by samples in order for quenching pressures to be recorded, 63 \nbefore discussing the interpretation of quenching pressures and their relationship to 64 \npalaeo-ice thicknesses. Finally, the potential effect of volatiles on the mechanisms of 65 \neruptions is described, along with key topics for future research.  66 \n  67 \n1.1. Previous studies of degassing: subglacial basaltic eruptions 68 \nTo date studies of volatile degassing at subglacial volcanoes have concentrated on 69 \nIcelandic and British Columbian examples (Table 1). Studies involved measurement 70 \nof the dissolved volatile contents in glassy samples collected from different elevations 71 \nat subglacially erupted tuyas (that pierced the ice surface and became subaerial) and 72 \ntindar ridges (that remained entirely subglacial). A schematic diagram of magma 73 \ndegassing and vesiculation during eruptions is given in Fig. 1; see Smellie (2000) for 74 \ndetailed definitions of eruption types. 75 \n In the first study to use magmatic volatile contents as a method to estimate the 76 \npalaeo-ice thickness, Dixon et al. (2002) looked at degassing at Tanzilla Mountain, 77 \nBritish Columbia \u2013 an entirely englacial volcanic edifice composed of alkali basalt 78 \noverlying a base of tholeiitic pillow lavas. H2O, S and Cl data showed that although 79 \nthe tholeiitic base had not significantly degassed the overlying alkali basalt had done 80 \nso. Pressure-solubility relations for basaltic magma (Dixon and Stolper, 1995) were to 81 \nestimate the confining pressure consistent with the measured H2O concentrations; this 82 \nled to the estimate that 400-900 m of ice lay over the vent during the eruption. This 83 \nrange of figures was roughly consistent with independent estimates of the ice sheet 84 \nthickness.  85 \n 5 \n Schopka et al. (2006) measured the water contents of samples from the base to 86 \nthe summit of Helgafell, a small-volume, 330 m-high Pleistocene basaltic tindar ridge 87 \nin western Iceland. Surprisingly, no systematic relationship between water content 88 \nand elevation was found and the low water contents (0.26-0.37 wt %) were consistent 89 \nwith lower quenching pressures than expected (equivalent to only 90-180 m of ice). 90 \nThe authors speculated that meltwater drainage may lead to confining pressures 91 \nconsiderably less than glaciostatic, so that the magma did not feel the full weight of 92 \nthe overlying ice when it quenched at the vent.  93 \n Hoskuldsson et al. (2006) found high water contents (0.85-1.04 wt %) in 94 \nPleistocene pillow lavas at Kverkfjoll, Iceland, which were consistent with eruption 95 \nbetween 1240 and 1880 m of ice. As Kverkfjoll is located in the centre of Iceland 96 \nwhere the ice thickness may have reached 2 km during glacial periods this range of 97 \nvalues is realistic. Hoskuldsson et al. also used the vesiculation of some pillow lavas 98 \nto argue that a sudden decrease in subglacial pressure occurred, due to the release of 99 \nsubglacial meltwater in a j\u00f6kulhlaup flood. 100 \n Edwards et al. (2009) found high magmatic water contents in basaltic pillow 101 \nlavas at Mt Edziza, British Columbia that make up an englacially erupted ridge. They 102 \nfound significant variations in volatile content with elevation, but there was no simple 103 \ntrend, and so suggested that the level of an ice-confined lake may have fluctuated 104 \nduring the eruption. 105 \n 106 \n1.2. Previous studies of degassing: subglacial intermediate and silicic eruptions 107 \nStudies to date of degassing during subglacial silicic eruptions have been restricted to 108 \nIcelandic examples. McGarvie et al. (2007) measured water contents in rhyolitic lavas 109 \nat Prestahn\u00fakur, a 600 m-high subglacially erupted edifice dominated by lava flows. 110 \n 6 \nLow water contents (0.10-0.14 wt %) were attributed to low-pressure degassing at the 111 \nvent followed by substantial downslope flow. Tuffen et al. (2008) found elevated 112 \nwater contents (0.50-0.52 wt %) in glass from Dalakv\u00edsl, Torfaj\u00f6kull consistent with 113 \npartial degassing during an explosive eruption within an subglacial cavity.  114 \n In the only study of intermediate magma to date Stevenson et al. (2009) found 115 \nhigh water contents (0.67-1.32 wt %) in andesitic and dacitic glasses from 116 \nKerlingafj\u00f6ll central volcano. As the highest water content measured required 117 \nunrealistically thick ice (>3 km), it was attributed to loading by thick ice and 118 \npyroclastic deposits. Tuffen and Castro (2009) traced degassing from the feeder dyke 119 \nto subaerial rhyolitic lavas erupted through thin ice\/firn at Hrafntinnuhryggur, Krafla. 120 \nThey found that subaerial lavas were degassed but with substantial small-scale 121 \nheterogeneity (0.11-0.20 wt % H2O) and the inferred quenching pressure from water 122 \ncontents in the feeder dyke was too high to be explained by loading by ice\/firn alone.  123 \n Denton et al. (2009) studied the post-emplacement hydration of rhyolitic lavas 124 \nand hyaloclastites from Torfaj\u00f6kull and Krafla and found that perlitisation and zeolite 125 \nalteration due to high-temperature interactions with meltwater could increase total 126 \nvolatile contents from ~1 wt % to as much as 9 wt %. 127 \n 128 \n 129 \n2. The use of volatile degassing to reconstruct quenching pressures: essential 130 \ncriteria 131 \nIn this section we present a new framework for the use of volatiles to reconstruct 132 \nquenching pressures during subglacial eruption, and systematically address the key 133 \ncriteria that must be met by samples for the technique to yield robust results. 134 \n135 \n 7 \n2.1. Volatile-saturated magma 136 \nMagma degasses as it rises from the chamber to the surface if the pressure decrease 137 \nduring its ascent is sufficient to create volatile oversaturation (e.g. Wilson, 1980). 138 \nThis then leads to the exsolution of dissolved volatiles from the melt phase into 139 \nvapour\/fluid within bubbles (e.g. Sparks, 1978), which leads to a decrease in the 140 \nconcentration of volatiles remaining in the melt. In order for the dissolved volatile 141 \ncontent remaining in a melt to record the confining pressure it is essential for some 142 \ndegassing to have occurred, so that there has been the chance for volatile diffusion 143 \ninto bubbles to keep track with any decrease in confining pressure. Therefore only 144 \nvolatile-saturated samples that have undergone some degassing should be used to 145 \nreconstruct quenching pressures. Samples that have not degassed can only indicate 146 \nminimum quenching pressures. 147 \n Indicators that volatile-saturated melt has been erupted come from both 148 \ntextures and geochemistry. The presence of vesicles in glasses (Fig. 2a) is taken to be 149 \ndiagnostic as it indicates that conditions for bubble nucleation and growth were 150 \nreached (e.g. Schopka et al., 2006). However, vesicles may collapse and thoroughly 151 \nheal (Westrich and Eichelberger, 1994), so the absence of vesicles does not 152 \nnecessarily indicate the melt was undersaturated. In lavas care must be taken not to 153 \nconfuse vesicles formed through volatile exsolution with cavities generated by late-154 \nstage brittle-ductile magma deformation (e.g. Smith et al., 2001). An important 155 \ncomplication is that the solubility of different volatile species differs greatly. For 156 \nexample, CO2 is much less soluble than H2O in silicate glasses (e.g. Johnson et al. 157 \n1994), so initial degassing may result in CO2 loss into vesicles with little loss in H2O. 158 \nThis means that vesicular glasses can form without the occurrence of significant H2O 159 \ndegassing. Geochemical evidence that degassing has occurred comes from comparing 160 \n 8 \nthe concentration of volatile species such as H2O with incompatible elements such as 161 \nK2O (e.g. Dixon et al., 2002; Nichols et al., 2002). As the concentration of both 162 \nspecies can increase through crystallisation a linear H2O-K2O trend is typically found 163 \nin magma suites (e.g. Nichols et al., 2002). Samples less water-rich than the linear 164 \ntrend are those that have degassed. 165 \n Subglacial volcanic successions have typically degassed to some extent, with 166 \npillow lavas, hyaloclastites and lava bodies almost invariably containing vesicles, but 167 \none exception is reported in the literature: the tholeiitic unit at the base of Mt Tanzilla, 168 \nBritish Columbia (Dixon et al., 2002). Nichols et al. (2002) also found that submarine 169 \npillow lavas on the Reykjanes Ridge had not degassed, in contrast with subglacial 170 \npillow lavas in Iceland. 171 \n An interesting implication is that the initial volatile content of the magma may 172 \nrestrict the maximum ice thickness it is possible to reconstruct from degassing. This 173 \nrestriction is most likely to apply to basaltic magmas, which typically have lower 174 \ninitial volatile contents than rhyolitic magmas (Johnson et al., 1994). Degassing of 175 \nwater from mid-ocean-ridge basalts only occurs beneath at most a few hundred metres 176 \nof water (Moore, 1970), whereas explosive pumice-producing eruptions of rhyolitic 177 \nmagma driven by water exsolution from melt may occur beneath water 1-2 km deep 178 \n(e.g. Wright et al., 2003). Volatile-rich rhyolitic eruptions can therefore be expected to 179 \nprovide a better record of palaeo-ice thicknesses than basalts when ice exceeds several 180 \nhundred metres in thickness, although the volatile content of both rhyolites and basalts 181 \ndepends strongly on the tectonic setting (Johnson et al., 1994). 182 \n The initial volatile content of magma recorded in primary melt inclusions 183 \nshould ideally be determined as this provides a complete picture of degassing from the 184 \n 9 \nchamber to the surface. Surprisingly, to date no published study of magma degassing 185 \nin subglacial eruptions has included melt inclusion data. 186 \n 187 \n2.2. Equilibrium degassing 188 \nIt is only possible to infer quenching pressures from the dissolved volatile contents in 189 \nvolcanic glasses if equilibrium degassing has occurred. The pressure-solubility 190 \nexperiments that underpin our understanding of how rising magma degasses are based 191 \non equilibrium exchange between the volatiles dissolved in the melt and present as 192 \nvapour or fluids in bubbles. Although it was long assumed that volatile degassing 193 \nduring magma ascent was always in equilibrium with the confining pressure (e.g. 194 \nWilson, 1980), most recent models have shown that non-equilibrium degassing may 195 \nbe important (e.g. Proussevitch and Sahagian, 1996). Non-equilibrium degassing is 196 \nalso apparent in MORB glasses, which tend to be supersaturated, indicating that the 197 \nkinetics of bubble nucleation and growth, driven by exsolution of CO2, are too slow to 198 \nmaintain melt-vapour equilibrium during magma ascent (Fine and Stolper, 1986; 199 \nStolper and Holloway, 1988; Dixon et al., 1988; 1995). Supersaturation is rarely 200 \nobserved in basalts with greater than 0.4 wt% H2O, however, as higher water 201 \nconcentrations promote faster diffusion rates allowing bubble growth to keep pace 202 \nwith magma ascent (Simons et al., 2002). 203 \n Non-equilibrium degassing occurs when the exsolution of volatiles into 204 \ngrowing bubbles is held back by sluggish bubble nucleation, viscous resistance to 205 \ndecompressive bubble growth or slow volatile diffusion into bubbles. The consequent 206 \ndelay in adjusting the amount of dissolved volatiles in the melt to a change in 207 \nconfining pressure can lead to an oversaturation of volatiles in the melt. Using models 208 \nof coupled diffusive-decompressive bubble growth in magmas, Proussevitch and 209 \n 10 \nSahagian (1996) have found that there is a threshold magma ascent rate above which 210 \nequilibrium degassing is unlikely to occur. This value is much lower for rhyolitic 211 \nmagmas (~1 m s\n-1\n) than basaltic magmas (>100 m s\n-1\n) as bubble growth and volatile 212 \ndiffusion are more strongly retarded by the higher viscosity of rhyolitic melt. 213 \n In order to know whether subglacially erupted glasses underwent equilibrium 214 \ndegassing it is therefore necessary to estimate the magma ascent rate. For basaltic 215 \nmagma it is thought that only the most violent phreatomagmatic eruptions involve 216 \nsufficiently fast ascent rates (in excess of 100 m s\n-1\n) to lead to non-equilibrium 217 \ndegassing (Mastin et al., 2004). Therefore one can be confident that almost all 218 \nsubglacial basaltic glasses (the margins of pillows, lavas, dykes, intrusions and 219 \nquench hyaloclastites) will have undergone equilibrium degassing. The only possible 220 \nexception is hyalotuffs formed during exceptionally violent magma-water 221 \ninteractions. 222 \n Rhyolitic magma, in contrast, will tend to undergo non-equilibrium degassing 223 \nunless magma ascent rates are less than 1 m s\n-1\n. Plinian explosive eruptions are likely 224 \nto involve far higher magma ascent rates (Wilson, 1980), whereas new petrological 225 \ndata shows that subplinian and effusive eruptions may involve far lower average 226 \nascent rates of <0.02 m s\n-1\n (Castro and Gardner, 2008). It must be noted, however, 227 \nthat these are average ascent rates over a ~4 km long conduit and final ascent rates 228 \nprior to fragmentation and quenching in the upper ~500 m of the conduit will be 229 \nsignificantly higher than this average value. Therefore any explosively erupted 230 \nrhyolitic deposit should be treated with caution, unless there is good evidence that the 231 \ndeposit may have cooled sufficiently slowly for re-equilibration to occur, e.g. the 232 \ndevelopment of substantial rheomorphic welding within pyroclastic deposits (Tuffen 233 \net al., 2008). 234 \n 11 \n The ascent rate of rhyolitic magma rising in a dyke (Fig. 2b) can be 235 \napproximated from the following expression for buoyant magma rise through the 236 \nIcelandic crust, adapted from equation 7 of Hoskuldsson and Sparks (1997): 237 \n 238 \n 239 \n 240 \n 241 \nwhere v is the magma rise velocity in m s\n-1\n, \u03c1c is mean crustal density over the dyke 242 \nlength (2700 kg m\n\u22123\n), \u03c1m is magma density (2300 kg m\n\u22123\n), g is the acceleration due to 243 \ngravity (9.81 m s\n\u22122\n), h is the dyke half-width in m and \u03bc is the magma shear viscosity 244 \nin Pa s.  245 \n Reasonable values of h and \u03bc for Icelandic eruptions are 2-10 m and 106-107 246 \nPa s respectively, providing a range of ascent rates of 0.001\u20130.27 m s-1, which falls 247 \nwell within the range for equilibrium degassing and independent estimates of ascent 248 \nrates from decompression experiments (Castro and Gardner, 2008). Therefore one can 249 \nbe confident that products of effusive subglacial rhyolite eruptions, such as lava lobes, 250 \nlava flows, quench hyaloclastites and feeder dykes, have undergone equilibrium 251 \ndegassing. 252 \n  253 \n2.3. Lack of post-quenching movement 254 \nIf a sample has degassed or quenched at one elevation but then subsequently moved to 255 \nanother elevation it may provide misleading information about the thickness of 256 \noverlying ice. For example, a lava flow may degas to atmospheric pressure if an 257 \neruption has melted through the ice surface, but then flow a considerable distance 258 \ndown the volcano flanks beneath a substantial thickness of ice (Fig. 3a; McGarvie et 259 \n\uf06d\n\uf072\uf072\n3\n)( 2gh\nv mc\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n 12 \nal., 2007). Such lava may be degassed to near atmospheric pressure but found near the 260 \nbase of a subglacial edifice erupted beneath thick ice. The greater the distance a lava 261 \ncan flow subaerially the closer it can come to being fully degassed to atmospheric 262 \npressure (Moore et al., 1995). Therefore when selecting a lava body to sample one 263 \nmust assess from field relationships whether it may have flowed a significant distance 264 \ndownslope from the vent (Fig. 3b). 265 \n There may also be considerable vertical movement of individual clasts in any 266 \nhydroclastic rocks formed during explosive magma-water interaction or deposited 267 \nwithin a meltwater lake, as well as uncertainty about quenching depths. Quenching 268 \nduring phreatomagmatic activity may occur at a depth of tens to hundreds of metres in 269 \nthe conduit if external water is able to interact with magma at that depth (Mastin et al., 270 \n2004). Therefore clasts within hyalotuffs formed during explosive magma-water 271 \ninteraction may not quench at the base of the ice but some depth beneath it, and the 272 \nquenching pressures recorded by volatile degassing may not indicate the hydrostatic 273 \npressure. Even if magma-water interaction only commenced once rising magma 274 \nencountered a body of meltwater at the base of the ice there could still be considerable 275 \nuncertainty about where quenching occurred if the meltwater depth were significant 276 \n(Fig. 3c). This is because individual clasts may quench during their trajectory within 277 \nthe body of meltwater (Gu\u00f0mundsson, 2003), which may be many tens of metres, 278 \nduring which the confining pressure will change. 279 \n Post-quenching movement of clastic material (Fig. 3c) is almost inevitable 280 \nduring deposition and will be most important when deposition occurs through a deep 281 \ncolumn of meltwater. Even in near-vent concentrated mass flow deposits where 282 \nindividual clasts do not enter a body of meltwater mass movement of material may 283 \ninvolve significant changes in elevation. Post-depositional movement may also occur, 284 \n 13 \nfor example due to edifice instability triggered by meltback of supporting ice walls, 285 \nwith downslope slumping of poorly or well-consolidated hyaloclastites (Skilling, 286 \n1994; Tuffen et al., 2001). The only clastic material likely to have quenched in-situ is 287 \nbreccias formed by at the margins of lava bodies, including peperites (e.g. Tuffen et 288 \nal., 2001; Smellie, 2008). 289 \n 290 \n2.4. Homogeneous samples  291 \nAn important question is therefore whether the volatile content of the volume 292 \nanalysed is representative of the degassing behaviour of the whole sample or whether 293 \nit is influenced by small-scale processes that create inhomogeneous volatile contents. 294 \nRecent microanalytical studies have revealed the extent to which water and other 295 \nvolatile species may be spatially heterogeneous in vesicle- and crystal-bearing glasses 296 \n(Castro et al., 2005; Castro et al., 2008). The heterogeneity may be due to frozen-in 297 \ndiffusion gradients around bubbles and crystals or within welded breccias (Rust and 298 \nCashman, 2007).  299 \n For example, late-stage spherulite crystallisation in obsidian erupted through 300 \nthin ice at Hrafntinnuhryggur, Krafla, Iceland has caused localised volatile enrichment 301 \nin the residual melt (Castro et al., 2008). Glass water contents increase from 302 \n\u201cbackground\u201d values of 0.10-0.14 wt % far from spherulites to ~0.20 wt % at the edge 303 \nof spherulites.  As spherulite crystallisation is a late-stage disequilibrium process that 304 \ncan locally increase melt volatile contents it is obvious that the \u201cbackground\u201d water 305 \nconcentrations are those that should be used to estimate the quenching pressure. 306 \nHowever in highly vesicular samples there may be no homogenous \u201cbackground\u201d 307 \nvolatile concentration as diffusion gradients from neighbouring bubbles overlap 308 \n(Tuffen, unpublished data 2009). In this case it is far from obvious which volatile 309 \n 14 \nconcentration should be taken as representative of the sample and bulk extraction 310 \ntechniques, which provide an average volatile concentration for milligrams to grams 311 \nof sample may be preferable, although results may be strongly affected by hydration 312 \n(see following section). 313 \n Therefore the most robust results will come from studies where multiple 314 \nanalyses have been first carried out to determine the degree of small-scale volatile 315 \nheterogeneity in samples. It is only then that there is the potential for measured 316 \nvolatile contents to reliably indicate quenching pressures. 317 \n In sections 3.3 and 3.4 we present data highlighting the strong heterogeneity in 318 \nmagmatic volatiles that may occur in subglacially erupted glasses. 319 \n 320 \n2.5. Lack of post-quenching hydration 321 \nSubglacial eruptions typically involve extensive interactions with meltwater both 322 \nduring and after activity (e.g. Gu\u00f0mundsson et al., 2004; Jarosch et al., 2008). Post-323 \neruptive hydration of clastic subglacial deposits by meltwater is therefore 324 \ncommonplace and basaltic hyaloclastites are almost always palagonitised, which 325 \ninvolves hydration by meteoric water (Jakobsson, 1978). Similarly rhyolitic 326 \nfragmental deposits are likely to be hydrated and perlitised (Denton et al., 2009). As 327 \nwater is the volatile species most commonly used to reconstruct quenching pressures 328 \ncare must be taken to avoid hydrated samples.  329 \n There are five methods that can be used to identify hydrated samples. (1) The 330 \nisotopic composition of water can be measured by coupling a bulk extraction 331 \ntechnique to high-resolution mass spectrometry (DeGroat Nelson et al., 2001). This 332 \ncan distinguish between magmatic and meteoric volatile signatures, but the technique 333 \n 15 \nis yet to be applied to any subglacially erupted deposit. It is the most reliable 334 \ntechnique. 335 \n(2) A microanalytical technique such as ion or electron microprobe or infra-red 336 \nmicrospectroscopy may be used to map the spatial distribution of volatile contents in a 337 \nsample and thus identify parts of a sample that have not been hydrated. (3) The 338 \nspeciation of water can be determined using infrared spectroscopy. Hydrated water 339 \ntends to remain as molecular H2O whilst magmatic water, when present in small 340 \nconcentrations (<1 wt %) is dominated by hydroxyl and silanol groups (Ihinger et al., 341 \n1994; Zhang, 1999). This technique is not infallible as the speciation of magmatic 342 \nwater is concentration- and cooling-rate dependent, but it can act as a useful guide. (4) 343 \nHydrated samples tend to dehydrate at lower temperatures than non-hydrated samples 344 \nduring bulk extraction techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis (Denton et al., 345 \n2009; Stevenson et al., 2009). Figure 4 shows the temperature of most rapid water loss 346 \nduring heating of subglacially erupted rhyolite glasses to 1250 \u00b0C in a 347 \nthermogravimetric analyser (Denton et al., 2009). There is a strong inverse 348 \nrelationship between the total volatile content, which is an approximate index of 349 \nhydration, and the temperature of fastest degassing. This relationship indicates that 350 \nhydrated water is more weakly bound to the silicate framework than magmatic water 351 \nand can be used to identify hydrated samples. (5) Hydration of glasses may create 352 \ndistinctive textures such as perlitic fracturing in rhyolites (Denton et al., 2009) or 353 \ndistinctive colouration (palagonitised basaltic glass is paler than fresh non-hydrated 354 \nglass). Although this criterion is the most readily applied and can be used in the field 355 \nit is not infallible as incipient hydration may not produce any obvious textures 356 \n(Denton et al., in preparation). It is therefore recommended that method (5) is used in 357 \n 16 \naddition to other quantitative methods. The extent to which the concentration of other 358 \nvolatile species can be affected by hydration and alteration is not currently known. 359 \n New data indicating heterogeneous hydration of subglacially erupted rhyolitic 360 \nglasses on two different spatial scales is presented in the following section. 361 \n  362 \n3. Case studies of volatiles in subglacially erupted rhyolitic glasses from 363 \nTorfajokull, Iceland 364 \nWe present data on the extent of volatile heterogeneity over different spatial scales in 365 \nrhyolitic glasses from Torfajokull, Iceland. The heterogeneity may be due either to 366 \nvariability in magmatic volatile contents or variable degrees of hydration by 367 \nmeltwater and has profound implications for which samples are suitable for 368 \nreconstructing palaeo-ice thicknesses and for how volatile concentrations are 369 \ninterpreted. 370 \n 371 \n3.1. Hydration \u2013 outcrop scale 372 \nRhyolitic lava lobes surrounded by quench hyaloclastite breccia were generated 373 \nduring an effusive subglacial eruption at Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur, Torfajokull, Iceland (Tuffen et 374 \nal., 2001; 2002a). Lobes are characterised by gradational contacts with the 375 \nhyaloclastite breccia, indicative of quench fragmentation during high-temperature 376 \nlava-meltwater interaction. The perlitic textures found in hyaloclastite and the lava 377 \nlobe margins indicate that hydration occurred during these interactions (Denton et al., 378 \n2009). To examine the extent of hydration of glass by meltwater samples were 379 \ncollected from lava lobe B120 at 63\u00b058'50.0'' N, 19\u00b003'15.1'' W at 780 m elevation on 380 \nthe eastern flank of Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur. Samples were taken from transect between the non-381 \nperlitised lava interior and the perlitised, quench-fractured margin (Fig. 5).  382 \n 17 \n The total volatile content of bulk samples was determined using a TA 383 \nInstruments SDT Q600 simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry \u2013 thermal 384 \ngravimetric analyser (DSC-TGA) instrument coupled to an HPR-20 QIC Gas 385 \nAnalysis System at Lancaster University. The furnace was purged by oxygen-free N2 386 \nduring measurements. Samples were crushed and sieved, the 125-500 \u03bcm size fraction 387 \nwas washed with acetone and then oven-dried at 110 \u00baC for ~1 hour prior to analysis, 388 \nfollowing the method of Newman et al. (1986). Approximately 30 mg of sample was 389 \nthen heated in platinum cups at 5 \u00baC min\n-1\n from ambient temperatures to 1250 \u00baC, 390 \nwhich was sufficient to thoroughly degas all volatile species. Mass spectrometer 391 \ncounts did not give quantitative concentrations of the different volatile species 392 \ndetected (H2O, CO2, F, Cl, SO2) but demonstrated that water was by far the most 393 \nabundant volatile species (Denton et al., 2009). At least one duplicate of each sample 394 \nwas measured and average results presented. 395 \n Total volatile content data is provided in Fig. 5 and Table 2. Over a distance of 396 \n33 cm the total volatile contents, which are dominated by water, increase strongly 397 \nfrom 1.06 to 1.96 wt %. This indicates progressive hydration from the near-pristine 398 \nglass of the lava lobe interior to the surrounding, strongly-perlitised hyaloclastite, 399 \nconsistent with the invasion of meltwater into crack networks in the cooling lava. In 400 \norder to reconstruct quenching pressures from magmatic water contents it is therefore 401 \nessential to sample the freshest, least hydrated glass possible from such an outcrop. As 402 \ntextures formed by incipient hydration and perlite formation may be difficult to 403 \nidentify (Denton et al. in preparation), it is therefore advisable to collect and analyse 404 \nmultiple samples from each locality. 405 \n 406 \n 407 \n 18 \n3.2. Hydration \u2013 sample scale 408 \nHydration may also create considerable variations in volatile content within individual 409 \nsamples, over a scale of hundreds of microns to millimetres. We have measured 410 \nspatial variations in water content within a sample of perlitised rhyolitic lava from 411 \nBl\u00e1hn\u00fakur. The sample was collected from the margin of an intrusive lava body 412 \nwithin perlitised hyaloclastite at 775 m elevation (63\u00b058' 44.6'' N, 19\u00b003'42.5'' W), on 413 \nBl\u00e1hn\u00fakur\u2019s western flank. Water contents were measured using the Thermo Nicolet 414 \nFourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) at The Open University, UK. A liquid 415 \nN2-cooled MCT-A detector and KBr beamsplitter was used, with a spot size of 45 x 416 \n45 \u03bcm. The sample chamber was purged with dried air and 256 scans were taken 417 \nbetween 5000 and 1000 cm\n\u20131\n. Samples were mounted to glass slides using 418 \nCrystalbond\u00ae resin and hand polished on both sides. Their thicknesses (~100-200 419 \n\u03bcm) were measured using a Mitutoyo digital displacement gauge, with an error of \uf0b1 5 420 \n\u03bcm. The intensities of the -OHT and -OH absorption peaks at 3550 cm\n\u20131\n and 4530 cm \n-\n421 \n1\n were used to calculate water contents using the Beer-Lambert law, a linear baseline 422 \ncorrection and absorption coefficients given by Ihinger et al. (1994). No CO2 peak 423 \nwas detectable. The water concentration was measured over a transect between the 424 \ncentre and margin of a perlitic bead ~500 \u03bcm in diameter. 425 \n Measured water contents are shown in Fig. 6, indicating strong gradients in 426 \nwater content on a 10-100 micron scale. These indicate variable degrees of hydration 427 \nassociated with different distances from the bead margin, consistent with the idea that 428 \nwater ingress occurs along the fractures bounding beads (Denton et al., 2009). The 429 \nbead centre is not significantly hydrated, meaning that the magmatic volatile content 430 \ncan here be measured. If a micro-analytical technique is being used to measure 431 \nvolatile contents and there is any evidence that hydration may have occurred (such as 432 \n 19 \nthe presence of cracks), it is advisable to collect multiple measurements from different 433 \npositions in the sample to determine the spatial distribution of hydration.  434 \n  435 \n3.3. Small-scale heterogeneity in magmatic volatiles: H2O in rhyolitic glass 436 \nSmall-scale heterogeneities in magmatic concentrations have recently been discovered 437 \nin subaerially erupted rhyolitic glasses and melt inclusions, associated with vesicle 438 \ngrowth and leakage of inclusions (Castro et al., 2005; Humphreys et al., 2008). 439 \nSimilar heterogeneities have also been identified in subglacially erupted obsidian 440 \nfrom Hrafntinnuhryggur, Krafla, Iceland (Castro et al., 2008), which were attributed 441 \nto late-stage spherulite crystallisation.  442 \n Subglacially erupted rhyolite glasses are commonly texturally heterogeneous, 443 \nwith the development of flow banding and welded breccia textures (Tuffen et al., 444 \n2003). To ascertain whether this can create heterogeneous volatile concentrations the 445 \nwater content within a sample of welded obsidian breccia was mapped. The sample 446 \nwas collected from a shallow dissected conduit at SE Rau\u00f0fossafj\u00f6ll rhyolitic tuya, 447 \nTorfaj\u00f6kull, Iceland (Tuffen et al., 2002b; Tuffen and Dingwell, 2005). Measurements 448 \nwere conducted using a Nicolet Model 800 infra-red spectrometer at the University of 449 \nBristol (Tuffen, 2001). Pea-sized samples of obsidian were mounted on a glass slide 450 \nwith dental resin, and double-polished to thicknesses of 100-600 \uf06dm. Thicknesses 451 \nwere measured with a Mitutoyo digital micrometer, with an accuracy of 5 \uf06dm. 452 \nAnalyses were carried out in a chamber purged with nitrogen, and background counts 453 \nwere made between every 3-4 analyses. A square beam of 50 \uf06dm width was used. The 454 \nheight of the absorbance peak at 3550 cm\n-1\n (total water, e.g. Zhang, 1999), was used 455 \nto calculate the water content, using the correlation coefficient of Newman et al., 456 \n(1988). Cumulative errors from uncertainties in measurements and the absorption 457 \n 20 \ncoefficient are about 10%. No CO2 absorption peaks were seen, indicating that CO2 458 \nconcentrations were below the detection limits of ~30 ppm.  459 \n Results (Fig. 7) confirm that strong heterogeneity in water content is present, 460 \nfrom 0.12 to 0.27 wt %, due to the juxtaposition of variably degassed fragments of 461 \nmagma during emplacement of the lava. Similar variations have been identified in 462 \nwelded pyroclastic obsidian samples from subaerial eruptions (Rust and Cashman, 463 \n2007). This poses a difficult question: which of this range of water concentrations is 464 \nrepresentative of the sample? The heterogeneity is due to variable amounts of 465 \ndegassing, rather than the ingress of external water, but which if any of the volatile 466 \ncontents best represents the pressure of quenching? As shallow brittle-ductile 467 \nprocesses such as those generating these textures can involve significant changes in 468 \nconfining pressure and weld together clasts with different degassing histories it is 469 \nwise to avoid such heterogeneous samples when seeking to reconstruct quenching 470 \npressures, and thus palaeo-ice thicknesses. 471 \n Rhyolitic glasses have a much stronger tendency than basaltic glasses to 472 \ncontain strong spatial heterogeneities in magmatic water contents, due to the more 473 \nsluggish diffusion of water through the melt (Zhang, 1999). Therefore these problems 474 \nare less likely to apply to basaltic glasses. 475 \n 476 \n3.4. Small-scale heterogeneity in magmatic volatiles: fluorine 477 \nTo determine whether other volatile species concentrations are also spatially 478 \nheterogeneous, we have carried out a study of fluorine concentrations in a sample of 479 \nflow-banded subglacially erupted rhyolitic obsidian from Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur. The sample, 480 \ncollected from the non-perlitic interior of lava lobe J2 at 710 m elevation (63\u00b058' 481 \n58.7'' N, 19\u00b003'43.6'' W) contains five distinctive colours of flow band (Fig. 8). Major 482 \n 21 \nelement and halogen concentrations were determined using a Cameca SX-100 483 \nelectron microprobe at the University of Cambridge and data are presented in Table 3. 484 \nThe analytical conditions used were optimised to minimise sodium loss, with an 485 \naccelerating voltage of 15 keV, beam current of 4 nA and spot size of 10 \u03bcm.  486 \n Figure 8 shows that strong spatial variations in fluorine contents exist, both 487 \nbetween and within flow bands. As other species are far less variable (Table 3) this is 488 \nattributed to heterogeneous degassing rather than mixing of magmas with contrasting 489 \ncompositions. Ductile processes such as the growth and collapse of vesicles can 490 \ntherefore also create considerable spatial variations in magma volatile contents. If 491 \nfluorine contents were used to estimate quenching pressures each flow band would 492 \nyield very different results and again there is the difficult question of which one value, 493 \nif any, can be taken as representative of the sample.  494 \n 495 \n4. Estimation of quenching pressures from volatile concentrations 496 \nOnce robust volatile concentration data for suitable samples has been gathered this 497 \ncan be used to estimate the pressure at which samples quenched. Although the 498 \nsolubility of all volatile species in magma is pressure-dependent (e.g. Blank and 499 \nBrooker, 1994; Carroll and Webster, 1994; McMillan, 1994) water is currently the 500 \nmost useful and widely employed as its pressure-dependent solubility is well 501 \ndocumented and it degasses over a range of pressures relevant to the load exerted by 502 \nice sheets and glaciers. The discussion below will therefore focus on the solubility of 503 \nwater as it is to date the only species used to estimate quenching pressures. 504 \n 505 \n4.1. Solubility-pressure relationships for water 506 \n 22 \nRecent experimental studies have determined the pressure-dependent solubility of 507 \nwater in magma spanning a wide range of magma compositions, temperatures, 508 \npressures and water contents (summarised in McMillan, 1994; Zhang, 1999). This 509 \nallows measured magmatic water contents to be converted to confining pressures if it 510 \nis assumed that degassing was in equilibrium.  511 \n There are many different formulae that can be used to calculate solubility 512 \npressures from water contents, which result from numerous studies on different 513 \nmagma compositions (e.g. Dixon and Stolper, 1995; Dixon et al., 1997; Moore et al., 514 \n1998; Papale et al., 2006) or have been subsequently derived from them (e.g. Mastin 515 \net al., 2004). The formulae used in previous studies of subglacial degassing are 516 \nindicated in Table 1. Due to its ease of use the most commonly employed is 517 \nVolatileCalc (Newman and Lowenstern, 2002). This allows any measured water 518 \ncontent to be converted to a solubility pressure for either rhyolitic or basaltic magma, 519 \nonce the magma temperature and CO2 content are specified. As water solubilities are 520 \nstrongly composition-dependent (e.g. solubilities in tholeiitic and alkalic basalts are 521 \ndifferent) grouping all magmas into rhyolitic or basaltic can introduce considerable 522 \nerror.  523 \n For intermediate magmas other models are therefore more appropriate, so in 524 \ntheir study of andesite and dacite degassing Stevenson et al. (2009) used the models of 525 \nMoore et al. (1998) and Papale et al. (2006). Another source of error when using 526 \nVolatileCalc is that the computational parameters used make solutions only 527 \napproximate at the low water contents (<1 wt %) typical of subglacial glasses (J. 528 \nLowenstern, pers. comm. 2008). 529 \n The solubility-pressure curves for water in rhyolitic and basaltic magmas 530 \ncalculated using VolatileCalc is shown in Figure 9. For rhyolitic magmas (Fig. 9a) 531 \n 23 \nthere is little difference between the curves for magma at 850 and 950 \u00b0C, which 532 \nspans the common range of eruptive temperatures, meaning that uncertainty about the 533 \neruptive temperature does not introduce significant error into the pressure estimates. 534 \nThe equivalent data for basalts (Fig. 9b) similarly shows relative insensitivity to 535 \neruption temperatures.  536 \n 537 \n4.2. The CO2 problem and the halogens 538 \nA major source of uncertainty in pressure estimates comes from the influence CO2 539 \nconcentrations exert on the saturation value of water (e.g. Liu et al., 2005). The 540 \naddition of only tiny quantities of CO2 to a melt (several to tens of ppm) strongly 541 \ndecreases the saturation value of water by reducing the water fugacity in vapour 542 \nphase. This increases the inferred quenching pressure for a given dissolved H2O 543 \nconcentration (Figure 9). Unfortunately the detection limits for measurement of 544 \ndissolved CO2 in glasses are typically 30 ppm for the most commonly used analytical 545 \ntechniques (infrared spectroscopy and ion microprobe, Ihinger et al., 1994).  546 \n This problem could therefore jeopardise the use of volatile degassing as a 547 \nuseful tool to reconstruct palaeo-ice thicknesses. However, in general subglacially 548 \nerupted magmas are likely to be almost CO2 \u2013free (e.g. Dixon et al., 2002), especially 549 \nthose degassed at pressures <5 MPa (~550 m ice), due to the low solubility of CO2 in 550 \nsilicic melts. To date, only one study has directly addressed the CO2 problem 551 \n(Edwards et al., 2009), through the use of a manometric technique to accurately 552 \nmeasure trace amounts of CO2. Other studies have either assumed that all CO2 has 553 \ndegassed (e.g. Dixon et al., 2002; Schopka et al., 2006) or acknowledged that 554 \nuncertainty about the CO2 concentrations prevents precise estimation of ice 555 \nthicknesses (Hoskuldsson et al., 2006; Stevenson et al., 2009). 556 \n 24 \n Other volatile species may also affect the solubility of water (e.g. Aiuppa et 557 \nal., 2009), as there are complex interactions between the solubilities of multiple 558 \nvolatile species in silicic melts at different redox conditions (e.g. Behrens and 559 \nGaillard, 2006). However the effects are likely to be less strong than that of CO2 (e.g. 560 \nCl has little effect on water solubility in basalt and andesite when present at 561 \nconcentrations of <1.9 wt %, Webster et al. 1999). In addition to modifying the Cl and 562 \nH2O solubilities, F can also lower the solidus and liquidus temperatures, lower 563 \nviscosity and change phase equilibria. Cl can influence fluid exsolution, magma 564 \nrheology and affect the activity of water and therefore can have many indirect effects 565 \non the melt properties (Aiuppa et al., 2009). 566 \n 567 \n4.3. Use of other species  568 \nAlthough progressive degassing of sulphur has been noted in basaltic tuya eruptions 569 \n(Moore and Calk, 1991) no study to date has used degassing of other species to infer 570 \nquenching pressures, as the solubility-pressure relationships for other volatile species 571 \nsuch as F, Cl and SO2 are less well known than H2O and CO2. As chlorine and 572 \nfluorine are relatively soluble in silicate melts their degassing predominantly occurs at 573 \nlow pressures; fluorine is generally more soluble than chlorine (Aiuppa et al., 2009). 574 \nIn aluminosilicate melts, the solubility of chlorine is a complex function of pressure 575 \nand water activity. In anhydrous melts, Cl solubility increases with pressure, where as 576 \nin water-rich melts Cl solubility tends to decrease with pressure (Webster & De Vivo, 577 \n2002). However, the relationships also depend on other factors, including melt 578 \ncomposition, oxygen fugacity, other volatile concentrations and temperature (Webster 579 \nand De Vivo, 2002; Aiuppa et al., 2009). The pressure-solubility relationships for 580 \nfluorine are not currently well known; fluorine concentrations in bulk glasses may 581 \n 25 \nexceed those in melt inclusions (J. Owen, unpublished data). This enrichment is due 582 \nto crystallisation within lava bodies, which increases the concentration in the 583 \nremaining melt (Stecher, 1998).  584 \n Despite these problems, as recent research is beginning to place better 585 \nconstraints on the pressure of degassing (e.g. Spilliaert et al., 2006; Edmonds, 2008; 586 \nAiuppa et al., 2009) halogen concentrations can potentially be used to track degassing 587 \nat low pressures during subglacial eruptions. As it has been suggested that fluorine 588 \ndegassing from Icelandic rhyolites only occurs at near-atmospheric pressure in 589 \nvesicular lavas (Stecher, 1998) low fluorine contents may therefore indicate when 590 \nmagma has reached the ice surface and provide a more sensitive barometer than 591 \ndegassing of water.  592 \n 593 \n5. The interpretation of quenching pressures 594 \nThe solubility pressure calculated from the measured sample water content provides 595 \nan estimate of the pressure at which the sample quenched. Early studies have simply 596 \nassumed that this pressure indicates the weight, and therefore thickness of the 597 \noverlying ice (e.g. Tuffen, 2001; Dixon et al., 2002), and a plot of volatile content vs. 598 \nelevation may therefore be expected to fall on a solubility-pressure curve 599 \ncorresponding to a given ice thickness (Fig. 10). However there are two major sources 600 \nof uncertainty about what the quenching pressure indicates \u2013 firstly, what causes the 601 \nloading in the first place and secondly, whether subglacial pressures are equal to the 602 \nweight of the overlying ice. Additionally, sample heterogeneity may introduce further 603 \nuncertainty about the significance of the results. 604 \n 605 \n5.1. Loading by ice, meltwater, firn, snow or rock? 606 \n 26 \nDuring a subglacial eruption magma may quench in direct contact with the overlying 607 \nice, or within a body of meltwater, the newly-formed volcanic edifice or the bedrock 608 \n(Fig. 11a). Therefore the pressure experienced by quenching magma may reflect a 609 \ncombination of loading by ice, meltwater, firn, snow or rock, all of which have 610 \ndifferent densities. This would lead to contrasting volatile content-elevation 611 \nrelationships, depending upon the density of the loading material (Fig. 11b). To date 612 \nonly two studies (Tuffen and Castro, 2009; Stevenson et al., 2009) have 613 \nacknowledged this important point. For the most reliable information about ice 614 \nthicknesses it is therefore preferable to sample from lithofacies that are known to have 615 \nquenched in direct contact with ice or meltwater. However, in reality this may be 616 \ndifficult. 617 \n Facies likely to have quenched in contact with ice include lavas with sub-618 \nhorizontal columnar joints (e.g. Lescinsky and Fink, 2000; Tuffen et al., 2001, Lodge 619 \nand Lescinsky, 2009) and pillow lavas with steep sides thought to be ice-contact 620 \nfeatures (Edwards et al., 2009). Fragmental hydroclastic facies such as hyalotuffs are 621 \nlikely to have quenched within a meltwater column (e.g. Gu\u00f0mundsson, 2003), 622 \nalthough large clasts may move significantly within the water column as they cool, 623 \ncreating uncertainty about exactly where quenching occurred. Hyaloclastites 624 \ngenerated through quench fragmentation at lava margins (e.g. Tuffen et al., 2001) are 625 \nlikely to have been loaded by overlying deposits when they quenched. The same is 626 \ntrue of intrusive lava bodies such as sills and dykes within either bedrock or juvenile 627 \nvolcanic deposits. Quenching in hyaloclastites and intrusive lavas probably therefore 628 \noccurs at pressures that reflect loading by rock as well as ice or meltwater. Rock 629 \ndensity may vary greatly, from 2700 kg m\n-3\n for basaltic crust (Hoskuldsson and 630 \n 27 \nSparks, 1997) to ~1900 kg m\n-3\n for basaltic hyaloclastites (Schopka et al., 2006) and 631 \neven lower for vesicular pyroclastic deposits. 632 \n As the top 40-70 m of temperature glaciers and ice sheets commonly consists 633 \nof poorly-compacted firn and snow (Paterson, 1994), the mean density of a thin ice 634 \nsheet\/glacier (<150 m) is likely to be substantially lower than the commonly-used ice 635 \ndensity of 917 kg m\n-3\n (Tuffen and Castro, 2009). A typical firn density is around 700 636 \nkg m\n-3\n. Any ice thickness estimates, especially for thin ice, therefore need to consider 637 \ndepth-dependent density of ice, firn and snow and a mean ice density value of 917 kg 638 \nm\n-3\n may be inappropriate. 639 \n  640 \n5.2. Case studies \u2013 H2O degassing at Hrafntinnuhryggur and Helgafell, Iceland. 641 \nTuffen and Castro (2009) reconstructed degassing from the feeder dyke to the surface 642 \nduring a small-volume effusive rhyolitic eruption at Hrafntinnuhryggur, Krafla, 643 \nIceland. Lithofacies relationships show that the eruption pierced thin ice (35-75 m), 644 \nwhich was likely to have been dominated by firn. Water concentrations were 645 \nmeasured using infra-red spectroscopy, for details of the analytical procedure see 646 \nTuffen and Castro (2009). As criteria for equilibrium degassing of water-saturated 647 \nmagma are met (vesicles present and an effusive rhyolitic eruption), the glass water 648 \ncontent ought to lie close to the pressure-solubility for water in rhyolitic melt. 649 \n However, when water content is plotted against distance beneath the upper 650 \nsurface of the lava (Fig. 12) it is found to be higher than expected if loading occurred 651 \nby the weight of firn alone (blue curve). Instead the measured water contents are 652 \nbetter fit if bedrock (basaltic hyaloclastite with a density of 1900 kg m\n-3\n) also 653 \ncontributed to loading (66 % bedrock and 34 % firn provides the best fit).  654 \n 28 \n Two field observations are consistent with this model: 1) where exposed the 655 \nfeeder dyke cuts basaltic hyaloclastite bedrock, and 2) based on the topography of the 656 \narea at least 40 m of rock is thought to have been eroded from above the feeder dyke. 657 \nThis study allows detailed investigation of shallow degassing as there are tight 658 \nconstraints on the ice\/firn thickness and extra geological information about the extent 659 \nof post-eruptive erosion. However in many cases this information is lacking, so it may 660 \nbe very difficult to reliably interpret volatile contents when the relative contribution of 661 \nice\/firn\/meltwater and rock to loading is not known. 662 \n Intriguingly, Schopka et al. (2006) found little difference in the volatile 663 \ncontent of basaltic glasses from shallow intrusions, hyaloclastites and pillow lava 664 \nselvages at the Pleistocene Helgafell tindar in south-west Iceland. One might expect 665 \nmarkedly different quenching pressures due to quenching beneath variable thicknesses 666 \nof hyaloclastite deposits. One explanation is that only 20-40 m of erosion is thought to 667 \nhave occurred at the tindar summit (based on the geomorphology of the edifice), and 668 \npotentially less on its flanks where samples were collected. The intrusive deposits 669 \nmay have therefore quenched close to the edifice surface, consistent with their 670 \nirregular shape. The problem of partial loading by rock will therefore be most 671 \nimportant at strongly eroded edifices where many tens or hundreds of metres of 672 \noverlying rock may have been removed. 673 \n 674 \n5.3. Non-glaciostatic cavity pressures 675 \nA major assumption that has underpinned much thinking about the meaning of 676 \nquenching pressures is that cavity pressures are glaciostatic \u2013 in other words, that the 677 \npressure of meltwater within subglacial cavities is equal to the weight of the overlying 678 \nice (e.g. Paterson, 1994). However, cavity pressure may be considerably less than 679 \n 29 \nglaciostatic (underpressure) if there is a hydrological connection established with 680 \neither the ice surface or the ice margin. If meltwater is moving within an arborescent 681 \nsystem of cavities melted upwards into the ice (Nye channels) then underpressure is 682 \nfavoured by high meltwater fluxes, and there is a critical meltwater flux necessary to 683 \nmaintain low pressure conditions (Hooke, 1984).  684 \n The development of ice cauldrons during subglacial eruptions such as Gj\u00e1lp is 685 \nconvincing evidence that underpressure can develop (Gu\u00f0mundsson et al., 2004), as 686 \ndownward deformation of the ice surface is driven by low pressure conditions at the 687 \nbase of the ice (an underpressure of ~2 MPa is consistent with the rate of ice 688 \ndeformation). Low pressure developed due to meltwater drainage into the 689 \nneighbouring Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn caldera, rather than due to the negative pressure changes 690 \npredicted by Hoskuldsson and Sparks (1997) for effusive basaltic eruptions under ice. 691 \nThis is because the heat transfer efficiency was low enough to favour overall volume 692 \nincrease and meltwater drainage from the eruption site (Gu\u00f0mundsson et al., 2004).  693 \n There is a growing body of field evidence for localised drainage of meltwater 694 \nfrom the eruption site during a variety of different subglacial eruption types spanning 695 \nbasaltic to rhyolitic magmas and from tindars to tuyas (Schopka et al., 2006; Skilling, 696 \n2009; Tuffen et al., 2001; 2002). Therefore underpressure may be expected to develop 697 \nduring many subglacial eruptions where active meltwater drainage is occurring, and 698 \ntherefore pressure experienced by magma quenching in contact with meltwater may 699 \nbe considerably less than glaciostatic (Fig. 13a). 700 \n Two papers have discussed the consequences of underpressure for the 701 \ndegassing behaviour of magma and the style of eruptions. Schopka et al. (2006) found 702 \nthat the water content of glasses at Helgafell tindar was significantly lower than that 703 \nexpected from the inferred ice thickness and solubility-pressure relationships. They 704 \n 30 \nnoted that the inferred underpressure of 1-2 MPa is similar to the underpressure 705 \nthought to have developed at Gj\u00e1lp in 1996, and identified deposits consistent with 706 \nchannelized syn-eruptive meltwater drainage towards the nearby ice margin. Schopka 707 \net al. attributed the unusual explosivity of the Helgafell tindar eruption with the low 708 \npressure conditions that developed during the eruption. 709 \n Hoskuldsson et al. (2006) discovered pillow lavas near Kverkfjoll, Iceland that 710 \nhave remarkably vesicular interiors. The high water content of lava margins is 711 \nconsistent with quenching beneath thick ice (~1 km) but the vesicularity of lava 712 \ninteriors was attributed to a sudden pressure decrease during the emplacement and 713 \ncooling of the pillow lavas. The authors suggested that meltwater drainage in an 714 \n[eruption-triggered] j\u00f6kulhlaup may have been responsible. There is compelling 715 \nevidence for major volcanically-triggered j\u00f6kulhlaups in the Kverkfj\u00f6ll area 716 \n(Carrivick et al., 2004), supporting this hypothesis. 717 \n As non-glaciostatic cavity pressures may commonly develop during subglacial 718 \neruptions this is a further factor that may decouple inferred quenching pressures from 719 \nthe actual thickness of overlying ice (Fig. 13b). It will affect only deposits loaded by 720 \nmeltwater when they quench, and so will not be a problem for ice-contact facies. 721 \n 722 \n5.4. Interpreting heterogeneous volatile contents 723 \nFigure 14 shows the range of quenching pressures inferred for the heterogeneous 724 \nwelded obsidian breccia at SE Rau\u00f0fossafj\u00f6ll (Fig. 14a, described in section 3.3) and 725 \nfor the variably perlitised rhyolitic lava lobe at Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur (Fig. 14b, described in 726 \nsection 3.1), assuming that the water content = total volatiles \u2013 0.6 wt %, Denton et 727 \nal., 2009). The water contents of the SE Rau\u00f0fossafj\u00f6ll sample, taken from the feeder 728 \ndyke that fed a subaerial tuya-capping lava flow, are consistent with quenching 729 \n 31 \npressures between 0.14 and 0.69 MPa, equivalent to 6-30 m of overlying lava 730 \n(assuming a density of 2300 kg m\n-3\n). Given the positions of the sampled conduit lava 731 \noutcrop approximately 25-30 m below the upper carapace of the lava flow it fed, the 732 \nhigher end of these values is therefore more appropriate. The most degassed material 733 \nwas a fine-grained welded breccia formed during fracturing of the lava, which 734 \nallowed transient degassing to a low confining pressure that is considerably lower 735 \nthan the load of the overlying lava. The data therefore illustrates an important point \u2013 736 \nthat there may be strong spatial variations in the amount of degassing within 737 \nindividual samples due to processes such as brittle-ductile deformation, which means 738 \nthat samples containing heterogeneous magmatic volatiles must be treated with 739 \nextreme caution.  740 \n The data for the variably perlitised Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur sample (Fig. 14b) indicate how 741 \nunreasonably high inferred ice thicknesses, due to hydration, can in some cases be 742 \nreadily identified. The range of reasonable ice thicknesses corresponds to the range of 743 \nice thicknesses inferred from tuya eruptions in the Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur region during the last 744 \nglacial period (McGarvie et al., 2006). This corresponds well to the inferred ice 745 \nthickness from the non-hydrated sample, whereas values of close to 2 km are clearly 746 \nunrealistic. However, if hydration is more subtle or there is no independent supporting 747 \nevidence for regional thicknesses around the time of the eruption erroneous values 748 \nmay be less readily recognised. The effects of sample hydration are to shift the water 749 \ncontent-elevation curve to the right of the \u201creal\u201d values that reflect magma degassing 750 \n(Fig. 13b). 751 \n 752 \n6. The significance of degassing during subglacial eruptions 753 \n 32 \nIn this section we discuss the extent to which magma degassing may control the 754 \nmechanisms and hazards posed by subglacial eruptions. The potential environmental 755 \neffects of volcanic gas emissions are also discussed. 756 \n 757 \n6.1. How does magma degassing control eruption mechanisms?   758 \nTo date we have little understanding of how magma degassing may influence the 759 \nmechanisms of eruptions under ice. Magmatic volatiles are thought to largely control 760 \nthe mechanism of subaerial silicic eruptions, with explosive \u201cmagmatic\u201d activity 761 \nfavoured by the retention of gases and transitions to effusive activity occurring when 762 \ngases become able to escape from magma during its ascent to the surface (transition 763 \nfrom closed to open-system degassing; Eichelberger et al., 1986).  764 \n In subglacial silicic eruptions explosively generated deposits are characterised 765 \nby highly inflated pyroclasts (Tuffen et al., 2002; Stevenson et al., 2009), indicating 766 \nsubstantial exsolution of retained magmatic volatiles in the conduit. Deposits indicate 767 \nthe rapid emplacement of pyroclastic debris within substantial well-drained cavities in 768 \nthe ice followed by breaching of the ice surface and possibly a major subaerial 769 \nexplosive phase. The products of non-explosive silicic eruptions are typically less 770 \nvesicular and there is abundant evidence for emplacement of lavas in close proximity 771 \nto ice (Tuffen et al., 2001).  772 \n It is not currently known whether the explosivity of rhyolitic subglacial 773 \neruptions is controlled by volatile degassing. Current models suggest that the 774 \nexplosive-effusive transition may be linked to the eruption rate, as this controls the 775 \namount of space above growing volcanic edifices in which meltwater can collect and 776 \ninteract explosively with magma (Tuffen et al., 2007; Tuffen 2007). If this is the case, 777 \nthe important question is then what controls the eruption rate; magmatic volatiles are 778 \n 33 \nlikely to play a major role (e.g. Wilson, 1980). It is plausible that explosive eruptions 779 \nare indeed those with high eruption rates, high magmatic volatile contents and 780 \ntherefore high magma vesicularity, but this has not been proven. Perhaps counter-781 \nintuitively, recent experiments have shown that explosive rhyolite-water interaction is 782 \nfavoured by degassed, high-viscosity melt, as brittle melt fragmentation may create 783 \nthe surface area needed to initiate runaway fuel-coolant interactions (Austin-Erickson 784 \net al., 2008). If this were the case for subglacial eruptions phreatomagmatic tephra 785 \nformed in violent explosions could be expected to be relatively vesicle-poor. 786 \nHowever, this is instead found in non-explosively generated deposits. Clearly more 787 \nresearch is needed to investigate links between the explosivity of subglacial eruptions 788 \nand the degree of magma vesiculation. 789 \n What controls the style of subglacial basaltic eruptions may be an even more 790 \ncomplex problem, as the explosivity of basaltic eruptions is largely determined by the 791 \nextent and violence of interaction with external water (Wohletz, 1986). In some 792 \ninstances volatile exsolution may also be important in triggering \u201cmagmatic\u201d 793 \nfragmentation (Cervantes and Wallace, 2003; Houghton and Gonnermann, 2008). 794 \nChanges in shallow degassing and vesiculation at individual vents over short 795 \ntimescales may lead to rapid shifts in the style of activity (Houghton et al., 1999; 796 \nCervantes and Wallace, 2003). As is the case for silicic eruptions, it is not obvious 797 \nhow shallow degassing affects the explosivity of basalt-water interactions. However, 798 \nit is believed that the style of eruptions within ice-confined meltwater lakes becomes 799 \nincreasingly explosive when the water depth is less than 200 m deep, which 800 \ncorresponds to a pressure of less than 2 MPa (summarised in Tuffen, 2007). In some 801 \nlocalities this inferred water depth marks the transition from quench hyaloclastites to 802 \nvesicular hyalotuffs (e.g. Jones, 1969; 1970) and thus a pressure threshold below 803 \n 34 \nwhich substantial magma vesiculation occurs. However, in other localities explosive 804 \nmagma-water interactions may take place at considerably higher confining pressures 805 \n(Gu\u00f0mundsson et al., 2004); non-explosive magma-water interaction in submarine 806 \nand sublacustrine settings may also occur beneath water only metres to tens of metres 807 \ndeep, leading to the formation of pillows (Batiza and White, 2000). How confining 808 \npressure controls the explosivity of magma-water interaction and what role 809 \nvesiculation plays in modifying interaction mechanisms therefore remain poorly 810 \nunderstood questions. Detailed studies of the links between multi-species degassing, 811 \nvesiculation and fragmentation mechanisms during subglacial eruptions are needed to 812 \nimprove our knowledge. 813 \n 814 \n7. Conclusions and challenges for future research 815 \nAlthough we are beginning to gain limited understanding of the behaviour of 816 \nmagmatic volatiles during subglacial eruptions there remain many substantial and 817 \nfundamental gaps in our knowledge that can be filled by future research. 818 \n\uf02d The use of volatile degassing to reconstruct palaeo-ice thicknesses is still in its 819 \ninfancy. Many factors need to be considered before making confident estimates of 820 \npalaeo-ice thicknesses, including non-equilibrium degassing, hydration, sample 821 \nheterogeneity, post-quenching sample movement, loading by rock as well as ice and 822 \nnon-glaciostatic pressure in subglacial cavities. Studies of deposits with good 823 \nsecondary constraints on ice thickness (from direct observations of recent eruptions or 824 \nother geological evidence for ancient eruptions) are first required in order to assess the 825 \nreliability of using volatile degassing alone. 826 \n\uf02d Detailed studies of the dissolved concentration of a broad range of volatile species 827 \n(H2O, CO2, SO2, F and Cl) in suites of samples from a variety of subglacial eruption 828 \n 35 \ntypes are required to better understand multi-species degassing and to what extent it 829 \ncan be used to reconstruct quenching pressures and thus palaeo-ice thicknesses. 830 \nParticular attention should be paid to previously-ignored species such as F and Cl as 831 \nthey may shed new light on the pressures of shallow degassing.   832 \n\uf02d More evidence for non-glaciostatic pressures and abrupt changes in pressure during 833 \nsubglacial eruptions needs to be gathered from detailed measurements of volatile 834 \nconcentrations and combined with geological evidence for changes in subglacial 835 \nmeltwater drainage. The effects of pressure changes on the mechanisms of eruptions 836 \nneed to be better understood. 837 \n\uf02d The analytical techniques used to measure volatile concentrations need to improve 838 \non the common practise of using infra-spectroscopy alone to determine H2O contents 839 \nin one part of a sample. Multiple analyses are required to quantify the degree of 840 \nheterogeneity within samples and techniques such as manometry, ion microprobe or 841 \nelectron microprobe are required to analyse other species (CO2, S, F, Cl).  842 \n\uf02d There is currently no data tracking magma degassing from the chamber to the 843 \nsurface during subglacial eruptions of any composition. Therefore it is not known how 844 \ninitial volatile contents and subsequent degassing during magma ascent affect 845 \neruption mechanisms and associated hazards. Furthermore, calculations of the volatile 846 \nflux to the environment from subglacial eruptions are yet to be carried out. 847 \n\uf02d It is not well established whether volatile degassing influences the explosivity of 848 \nmagma-meltwater interactions during subglacial eruptions. Comparison of 849 \nvesiculation, degassing and fragmentation behaviour during basaltic and rhyolitic 850 \neruptions is therefore required. 851 \n 852 \nAcknowledgements 853 \n 36 \nHT was supported by a NERC Research Fellowship and JO by a NERC research 854 \nstudentship.

Significant 1187 \nmovement may occur during quenching, especially if explosive magma-water 1188 \ninteractions occur in a substantial depth of meltwater. Clast movement during 1189 \n 50 \ndeposition is also inevitable and may transport clasts an appreciable vertical distance 1190 \nbeneath the zone of quenching. 1191 \n 1192 \nFigure 4. The relationship between the total volatile content of variably hydrated 1193 \nsubglacially erupted rhyolitic glasses from Torfaj\u00f6kull, Iceland and the temperature of 1194 \nfastest weight loss during bulk extraction experiments (using the thermogravimetric 1195 \ntechnique), from Denton et al. (2009). As hydrated water is predominant in molecular 1196 \nform and loosely bound to the glass it is lost at lower temperatures than more tightly-1197 \nbound magmatic water (mostly OH\n-\n). Therefore the behaviour of samples during 1198 \ndehydration experiments may help to indicate which are hydrated.  1199 \n 1200 \nFigure 5.

(c) The total volatile contents (predominantly H2O) of samples from 1204 \nthe four textural zones indicated in (a) and (b), showing much higher values for more-1205 \nperlitic lava at the lobe edge than less-perlitised lava further towards the lava interior. 1206 \n 1207 \nFigure 6.

A water content map determined using infra-red spectroscopy (at the 1216 \nUniversity of Bristol) on a sample of rhyolitic obsidian from the upper part SE 1217 \nRaudfossafjoll tuya, Iceland. There is considerable heterogeneity over scales of 1218 \nhundreds of microns to millimetres associated with the presence of welded fragmental 1219 \nmaterial (tuffisites) formed during fracture and healing of the magma. Modified from 1220 \nTuffen (2001).  1221 \n 1222 \nFigure 8. A sample of subglacially erupted rhyolitic obsidian from Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur, 1223 \nIceland with highly heterogeneous fluorine content. Five different coloured flow 1224 \nbands were analysed (Table 3) and each has distinctive fluorine contents (individual 1225 \ndata points are plotted as crosses over each corresponding band, average values for 1226 \neach band are also shown as other shapes). This heterogeneity may reflect shallow 1227 \nmixing of distinct magma batches or contrasting vesiculation and degassing paths of 1228 \nbands of neighbouring melt.  1229 \n 1230 \nFigure 9. Pressure-solubility relationships for H2O in basalts and rhyolites at different 1231 \nmagma temperatures and CO2 contents, calculated using VolatileCalc (Newman and 1232 \nLowenstern, 2002). (a) Basaltic magma, where the CO2 content has an extremely 1233 \nstrong effect on quenching pressures and inferred ice thicknesses, especially at low 1234 \nH2O concentrations. However, as discussed in the text, it is highly unlikely that water-1235 \npoor magmas will contain this quantity of CO2. According to the VolatileCalc 1236 \nsoftware, magma temperature does not strongly affect water solubility in basalt, the 1237 \n1150 \u00b0C curves correspond with those at 1250 \u00b0C. (b) Rhyolitic magma, where the 1238 \ninferred quenching pressure and ice thickness depends strongly on the CO2 content, 1239 \n 52 \nwith only 30 ppm of CO2 (the detection limit for most analytical techniques) greatly 1240 \nincreasing the solubility pressure. Magma temperature has only a minor influence on 1241 \nthe pressure-solubility relationships. 1242 \n 1243 \nFigure 10.

The solubility curves for three different ice thicknesses are indicated (330, 500 1246 \nand 800 m). Plotting sample water contents against their elevations may there indicate 1247 \nthe approximate ice thickness, if other factors do not affect the sample volatile 1248 \ncontents or quenching pressures.

(5) Quenching 1255 \nwithin meltwater, loading by meltwater only. In each case the mean density of the 1256 \noverlying material will be different. (b) Graph of predicted degassing trends with 1257 \nelevation for a basaltic edifice emplaced beneath 800 m of ice\/firn or rock. The 1258 \ndifferent densities of loading materials produce drastic differences in the predicted 1259 \ndegassing trends, which would make accurate estimation of ice thicknesses 1260 \nimpossible. It is therefore essential to have good constraints on the relative 1261 \ncontribution of rock to ice\/firn to loading. Curves are labelled with densities (kg m\n-3\n) 1262 \nfor each loading material. 1263 \n1264 \n 53 \nFigure 12. Magma degassing from the feeder dyke to the surface at 1265 \nHrafntinnuhryggur, Iceland as shown by decreasing glass water contents with 1266 \nelevation (Tuffen and Castro, 2009). The heterogeneity in water contents at a shallow 1267 \nlevel (in the subaerial lava carapace) is due to crystallisation within the lava (Castro et 1268 \nal., 2008). Feeder dyke water contents are not consistent with loading by the inferred 1269 \nthickness of firn (~50 m), nor by bedrock alone, but instead by a combination of firn 1270 \nand bedrock (green line). This result is consistent with field evidence for erosion of 1271 \nbedrock from around the feeder dyke (Tuffen and Castro, 2009). 1272 \n 1273 \nFigure 13. (a) Cartoon illustrating the difference between the piezometric water head 1274 \n(the height to which meltwater would rise within a vertical borehole, which is 1275 \nproportional to the water pressure) and the meltwater head if pressure were 1276 \nglaciostatic. This difference is the underpressure, it has developed here as there is 1277 \nhydrological connection between the vent area and the ice margin. The gradient of the 1278 \npiezometric water head drives meltwater flow, in this case away from the eruption site 1279 \nand towards the ice margin. Modified from Schopka et al., 2006. (b) A theoretical 1280 \ndataset showing three different scenarios when glass water content is plotted against 1281 \nelevation at a subglacially erupted edifice. The solid curve shows the expected 1282 \nrelationship between quenching pressure and elevation, using a given ice surface 1283 \nelevation consistent with other observations. The green points indicate glaciostatic 1284 \npressure conditions and data fit well to the modelled curve. Points that plot 1285 \nsignificantly to the left (red series, lower than expected water content) may indicate 1286 \nunderpressured cavity conditions (Schopka et al., 2006). Points that plot far to the 1287 \nright (blue series) may indicate hydration by meteoric water (Denton et al., 2009). 1288 \n 1289 \n 54 \nFigure 14. Diagrams illustrating the implications of sample volatile heterogeneity for 1290 \ninterpreting quenching pressures. Solubility calculations assume CO2-free melt and 1291 \nwere made using VolatileCalc. (a) Heterogeneous water contents in welded lava 1292 \nsample TCO7 from SE Rau\u00f0fossafj\u00f6ll, which was overlain by a subaerial rhyolite 1293 \nlava flow, and their saturation pressures. The grey box illustrates the estimated 1294 \nconfining pressure due to the overlying lava. Water contents compatible with lower 1295 \npressures than this probably reflect degassing to near-atmospheric pressure during 1296 \nfracturing of the lava. This process superimposed melt with contrasting degassing 1297 \nhistories within a single welded sample.

The possible consequences of a decrease in the level of a meltwater lake 1302 \nduring a subglacial eruption. (a) Pre-drainage, pillow lavas are being erupted at high 1303 \nwater pressure. (b) Due to subglacial meltwater drainage the lake level dramatically 1304 \ndrops, triggering increased magma vesiculation and explosive interactions with 1305 \nmeltwater.
