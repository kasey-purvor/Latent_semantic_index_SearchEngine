The problem of determining the temperature T (or the con-\ntaminant concentration) in a prescribed steady fluid flow u involves the solution of\nthe nondimensional equation\nu \u00b7\u2207T = \u03b5\u22072T,(1.1)\nwhere, in many practical cases such as high-Prandtl-number flows, the inverse Pe\u00b4clet\nnumber \u03b5 is small. In this paper we will make some remarks about the structure of\nthe solution in cases when the flow streams two-dimensionally, with prescribed tem-\nperature T\u221e (not necessarily constant) at large distances from a finite impenetrable\nobstacle \u0393 at which certain boundary conditions are prescribed.\nProblems of this type have been considered by authors too numerous to cite here,\nbut the papers [7, 8] are particularly relevant to our work: there u is taken to be\nof constant magnitude and direction which means that the flow can penetrate the\nobstacle, but the resulting asymptotic analysis reveals an interesting boundary-layer\nstructure near the obstacle and a downstream wake or \u201cshadow\u201d that is reminiscent of\nthe patterns of light intensity encountered in geometrical optics. Indeed the method-\nology we will adopt for solving (1.1) will be analogous to ray theory, and the principal\nmotivation for the methodology applies equally to geometrical optics: the few ex-\nplicit solutions that are available often take the form of infinite series that converge\nonly slowly when the solution varies on scales much smaller than those dictated by\nthe geometry. These variations take the form of high-frequency oscillations in wave\npropagation problems and boundary-layer behavior in diffusion problems, and the\nnumerical algorithms are often costly.\nThe main part of this paper will describe the detailed asymptotic solution of a\nprototypical two-dimensional problem in which u takes a particularly simple form,\nbut before we embark on this we make some general remarks about the features we\nexpect the solution to exhibit.\n\u2217Received by the editors September 1, 1998; accepted for publication (in revised form) March 25,\n1999; published electronically December 3, 1999.

J. CHAPMAN, J. M. H. LAWRY, AND J. R. OCKENDON\nWe assume from the outset that the boundary conditions at the obstacle prohibit\na solution in the form of a regular perturbation expansion in which the leading-order\ntemperature field satisfies\nu \u00b7\u2207T0 = 0 with T0 \u223c T\u221e as |x| \u2192 \u221e\nup to and including the boundary of the obstacle. For such problems we expect the\nconventional structure in which there is an \u201couter\u201d solution away from the obstacle in\nwhich T ' T0 and an \u201cinner\u201d thermal boundary layer that is increasingly thin as \u03b5\u2192\n0. For example, if the temperature or heat flux is prescribed at the obstacle, we expect\nthe boundary-layer thickness to be O(\u03b51\/2) or O(\u03b51\/3) depending on whether the fluid\nis inviscid or viscous, respectively. However, these orders of magnitude may change if\na heat transfer boundary condition is imposed and also in the vicinity of stagnation\nand separation points on the obstacle. We will return to these complications later.\nIn many situations, higher-order corrections to this asymptotic scenario can be\nfound quite simply. Away from the boundary, T can be expanded as T \u223c T0+\u03b5T1+\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7,\nwhere u \u00b7\u2207T1 = \u22072T0 etc., to obtain successively improved algebraically small im-\nprovements for small \u03b5. These improvements account for local diffusion superimposed\non dominant convection. This calculation would go hand in hand with improved\nboundary-layer corrections that match with the outer corrections at each stage of the\niteration. However, one situation in which this procedure yields no information is\nwhen T\u221e is constant, so that the fluid is nearly isothermal away from the thermal\nboundary layers. In such a case the correction to T\u221e is exponentially small in \u03b5 away\nfrom these layers.1 Furthermore, because these exponentially small corrections origi-\nnate at the boundary, they can only be found from a global calculation rather than the\nlocal iteration described above, which just requires integration along the streamlines.\nThe question immediately arises as to which points in the boundary have the greatest\neffect on the temperature correction at any point in the flow, and this is one of the\ncrucial aspects of the following analysis.\nIn section 2 we give a brief description of the application of ray theory to (1.1), and\nthen in section 3 we describe in detail what happens when T\u221e = 0 and u is inviscid\nand irrotational and the boundary is isothermal: this two-dimensional configuration\nis one that is relatively simple to explain yet interesting enough to be a paradigm for\nthe more general situations to which we refer in the conclusion.\n2. The ray method for convection-diffusion in two dimensions. We con-\nsider (1.1) with T \u2192 0 as x2 + y2 \u2192\u221e and T = 1 on a smooth closed impenetrable\nbody \u0393. Because an expansion in powers of \u03b5 would yield no information, we consider\nthe effect of applying the WKB ansatz\nT = \u03b5\u03c3 exp(\u03a6\/\u03b5) (A0 + \u03b5A1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7) ,(2.1)\nwith the assumption that \u03b5\u00bf 1. The constant \u03c3 will be chosen to make the leading-\norder equation nontrivial. This technique allows the rapid exponential decay in T\ncharacteristic of small diffusivity to be captured in the slowing varying quantities \u03a6\nand Aj , with immediate computational and theoretical advantages. This approach is\nwidely used in problems in wave propagation in the frequency domain [6, 1, 2], where\n\u2212i\u03a6 corresponds to the phase of a wave and the Aj are the amplitude coefficients:\n1Indeed such exponentially small corrections occur for more general T\u221e and, if \u03b5 is not too\nsmall, then this can make an observable contribution to the temperature field, as can happen in\nhigh-frequency wave propagation.\nHIGH-PE\u00b4CLET-NUMBER CONVECTION-DIFFUSION 123\nthere the ansatz (2.1) is applied to the Helmholtz equation or a variant and the limit\n\u03b5\u2192 0 corresponds to the high-frequency limit. The ansatz (2.1) may also be applied\nto other equations [4] including the convection-diffusion equation [10, 9], and the\nfollowing procedure is taken from those papers.\nApplying (2.1) to (1.1), we obtain at leading order\n(\u2207\u03a6)2 \u2212 u \u00b7\u2207\u03a6 = 0,(2.2)\nwhich is the equivalent to the eikonal equation of geometrical optics. Its characteristics\nare solutions of\nx\u02d9 = u\u2212 2p,(2.3)\np\u02d9 = \u2212 (p \u00b7\u2207)u+ (\u2207\u2227u)\u2227p,(2.4)\n\u03a6\u02d9 = \u2212p \u00b7 u = \u2212|p|2(2.5)\nwith p = \u2207\u03a6 and where a dot denotes differentiation along the characteristic. We\nsee from (2.5) that \u03a6 decreases along a characteristic, corresponding to exponential\ndecay of the quantity T .\nEquating higher orders in \u03b5 give the transport equations\nu \u00b7\u2207Aj = 2\u2207\u03a6 \u00b7\u2207Aj +Aj\u22072\u03a6 +\u22072Aj\u22121 (j = 0, 1, 2, . . .),(2.6)\nwhere A\u22121 \u2261 0. These may be rewritten as ordinary differential equations in the\nparameter along the characteristics of (2.2), whence\nA\u02d9j \u2212Aj\u22072\u03a6 = \u22072Aj\u22121.(2.7)\nIf we use t to parametrize a characteristic (so that the dots in (2.3) and (2.7) represent\n\u2202\/\u2202t) and label the characteristics (perhaps by parametrization of the initial data)\nby s, then we may calculate the Jacobian\nJ =\n\u2202(x, y)\n\u2202(s, t)\n(2.8)\nof the mapping from characteristic coordinates to space coordinates. This satisfies\nthe transport equation\nJ\u02d9 = J\n(\u2207\u00b7u\u2212 2\u22072\u03a6) ,(2.9)\nwhich in combination with (2.7) gives\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n(\nA2jJ\n)\n= A2jJ\u2207\u00b7u+ 2AjJ\u22072Aj\u22121.(2.10)\nHence if the flow is incompressible, then the quantity A20J is conserved. (This is also\nanalogous to the equivalent conserved quantity in geometrical optics, where it may\nbe interpreted as conservation of energy in a pencil of rays.)\nWe see from (2.2) that curves on which \u03a6 is constant have the vector u \u2212 p as\ntangent. Since to leading order these coincide with curves of constant T , we will call\nthem isotherms. The tangent vector field to these curves bisects the angle formed by\nthe ray (with direction t = u\u2212 2p) and the flow u at each point (see Figure 2.1).\nWe note that if we write t = x\u02d9 = u\u22122p for the direction of a characteristic, then\nt2 = u2(2.11)\n124 S.

Hence the quantity\nT decays exponentially along a ray at a rate that depends on the angle between the\nray and flow.\nIn the next section we will need not only this basic version of ray theory, but\nalso the methodology of the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) [6]. In simple\nterms, GTD states that whenever the ansatz (2.1) breaks down (e.g., at caustics), or\nwhenever there is a singularity in the boundary data, an \u201cinner\u201d region needs to be\nintroduced whose solution is matched with the outer ray solution. These regions may\nor may not include the thermal boundary layers referred to in the introduction, but\nin any case they are analogous to those regions in optics where diffraction occurs. In\nthese regions, \u201cinner\u201d diffraction problems must be solved to provide initial data for\nthe ray equations (2.3)\u2013(2.5).\n3. Inviscid irrotational flow. Throughout this section, we assume that u is\nsuch that \u2207\u2227u = 0 and u \u00b7n = 0 on the boundary of \u0393, where n is the normal, and\nthat there is no circulation around \u0393. This immediately enables us to make a number\nof helpful observations.\nFirst, the quantity |u| corresponds to the refractive index of the medium; if this\nquantity is constant, then the rays are straight lines. Second, by Bernoulli\u2019s theorem,\nthe quantity p\/\u03c1+ 12u\n2 is constant throughout the flow (where p is the pressure of the\nfluid and \u03c1 is the density), and hence the characteristics bend toward regions of low\npressure, just as the rays of geometrical optics bend toward regions of high refractive\nindex. Furthermore, we can construct a velocity potential \u03c6 and stream function \u03c8\nsuch that u = \u2207\u03c6 = \u2207\u2227\u03c8k. In the (\u03c6, \u03c8) coordinate system, the problem reduces\n(upon redefining x = \u03c6, y = \u03c8) to\n\u2202T\n\u2202x\n= \u03b5\n(\n\u22022T\n\u2202x2\n+\n\u22022T\n\u2202y2\n)\n;(3.1)\nHIGH-PE\u00b4CLET-NUMBER CONVECTION-DIFFUSION 125\nin other words, we may conformally map the inviscid flow past a finite body onto\nuniform flow past a finite flat plate parallel to the flow u = (1, 0), and the equation\nfor T is also preserved by this mapping (see Figure 3.1). The boundary condition on\nthe plate is T = 1. The front and rear ends of the plate correspond to the stagnation\npoints in the flow around the original body. Without loss of generality, we choose\nthe ends of the plate to be at (0, 0) and (1, 0). By (2.12), it follows that in the\nstream-function\/velocity-potential coordinates, the characteristics (to which we will\nhenceforth refer as rays) are straight lines.\nOf course, the mapping from (1.1) to (3.1) holds for all Pe\u00b4clet numbers, and an\nexact solution may be found by separating the equation in elliptic coordinates and\nwriting the solution as an infinite sum of products of Mathieu and modified Mathieu\nfunctions [3]. We expect the asymptotic expansion of this solution for a large Pe\u00b4clet\nnumber to agree with the asymptotic solution we will obtain by direct asymptotic\nmethods applied to (3.1). A start has been made on such comparisons in [3], where\nthe surface heat flux (which is algebraic in \u03b5) computed from the boundary layer\nsolutions have been compared with those resulting from the explicit eigenfunction\nexpansion of the solution. The agreement is good for \u03b5 < 1\/2, but it is much harder\nto make comparisons away from the boundary because of the slow convergence of\nthese series in the region where T is exponentially small. It would be interesting to\nknow if procedures such as the Watson transform [5], which are useful in converting\neigenfunction expansion solutions of Helmholtz equation into integrals suitable for\nasymptotic computation, can be applied to the series in [3], but we know of no results\nin that direction.\n(a) (b)\nFig. 3.1. Inviscid irrotational flow past (a) a circular cylinder and (b) a flat plate. Curves of\nconstant stream-function (solid) and constant velocity potential (dashed) are shown.\nFor the paradigm problem (3.1) with T = 1 at the plate and T\u221e = 0, we now\naddress the key questions of where the rays originate and what initial data they must\nsatisfy. First we note that if we attempt to give \u03a60 = 0 as initial data on x0 = s,\ny0 = 0 (0 < s < 1), then we find that p0 = 0, q0 = 0 so that none of the rays leaves the\n126 S. J. CHAPMAN, J. M. H. LAWRY, AND J. R. OCKENDON\nplate. However, following the methodology of GTD we expect rays to be generated\n(\u201cdiffracted\u201d) at points where the boundary is not smooth. Thus we will begin by\nconsidering the inner \u201cdiffraction\u201d problem in the vicinity of the leading edge of the\nplate, whose far field should provide us with initial data for the ray equations.\n3.1. Leading edge. Near the leading edge of the plate, a rescaling of the coor-\ndinates\nx = \u03b5x\u02dc, y = \u03b5y\u02dc(3.2)\nresults in (3.1) taking the form\n\u2202T\n\u2202x\u02dc\n=\n\u22022T\n\u2202x\u02dc2\n+\n\u22022T\n\u2202y\u02dc2\n,(3.3)\nwith boundary and matching conditions\nT = 1 (y\u02dc = 0, x\u02dc > 0),(3.4)\n\u2202T\n\u2202y\n= 0 (y\u02dc = 0, x\u02dc < 0),(3.5)\nT \u2192 0 at infinity.(3.6)\nCondition (3.5) results from the symmetry under reflection in the y-axis. The equation\nseparates in parabolic coordinates \u03be\u02dc, \u03b7\u02dc where x\u02dc = \u03be\u02dc2 \u2212 \u03b7\u02dc2, y\u02dc = 2\u03be\u02dc\u03b7\u02dc, so that\n\u22022T\n\u2202\u03be\u02dc2\n+\n\u22022T\n\u2202\u03b7\u02dc2\n= 2\n(\n\u03be\u02dc\n\u2202T\n\u2202\u03be\u02dc\n\u2212 \u03b7\u02dc \u2202T\n\u2202\u03b7\u02dc\n)\n(3.7)\nand the solution is\nT = erfc \u03b7\u02dc;(3.8)\nthe isotherms are shown in Figure 3.2.\nIn the limit of large \u03b7\u02dc, we have\nT \u223c 1\n\u03b7\u02dc\n\u221a\npi\nexp(\u2212\u03b7\u02dc2) = csc(\u03b81\/2)\u221a\npir\u02dc1\nexp\n[\nx\u02dc\u2212 r\u02dc1\n2\n]\n,(3.9)\nwhere r1, \u03b81 are polar coordinates corresponding to x, y, and r1 = \u03b5r\u02dc1. This means\nthat, in (2.1), \u03c3 = 1\/2 and the matching condition that the outer ray solution must\nsatisfy near the leading edge is\n\u03a6 \u223c 1\n2\n(x\u2212 r1), A0 \u223c csc(\u03b81\/2)\u221a\npir1\n.(3.10)\nHigher-order amplitude coefficients Aj are determined by further terms in the asymp-\ntotic expansion of erfc.\nThe implication for the outer ray solution is that t = (x\/r1, y\/r1) and conse-\nquently a family of rays emanates radially from the leading edge of the plate, as\nshown in Figure 3.3. The amplitude coefficients are singular at the leading edge of\nthe plate, but the leading-order amplitude A0 is of the form f(\u03b81)\/\n\u221a\nr1 where the di-\nrectivity function f(\u03b81) has been found and is analogous to a diffraction coefficient in\nGTD. The behavior of A0 as r\n\u22121\/2\n1 follows from the shape of the rays and (2.10). We\nHIGH-PE\u00b4CLET-NUMBER CONVECTION-DIFFUSION 127\n-2 -1 1 2 3 4\nx\n-3\n-2\n-1\n1\n2\n3\ny\nFig. 3.2.

As in GTD, the far field has A0 independent of polar angle. Hence the\nleading edge of the plate may be thought of as acting as a point source, but with\ndirectivity of amplitude \u03b5 csc(\u03b81\/2)\/\n\u221a\npi.\n3.2. Thermal boundary layer. Since the ray approximation becomes singular\nat \u03b8 = 0 there is a further inner region close to the top of the plate where x =\nO(1), y = O(\u03b51\/2), with y > 0. With these scalings (3.1) takes the familiar thermal\nboundary-layer form\n\u2202T\n\u2202x\n=\n\u22022T\n\u2202y\u02c62\n+ \u03b5\n\u22022T\n\u2202x2\n,(3.13)\nwhere y =\n\u221a\n\u03b5y\u02c6. To leading order (3.13) has a similarity solution,\nT = erfc\n(\ny\u02c6\n2\n\u221a\nx\n)\n,(3.14)\nwhich matches with (3.8) in the limit x \u2192 0, y\u02c6 \u2192 0. For future reference, we note\nthat as y\u02c6 \u2192 0 and x = O(1),\nT \u223c 1\u2212 y\u02c6\u221a\npix\n+O(y\u02c63).(3.15)\nMore important, in outer coordinates (3.14) is\nerfc\ny\n2\n\u221a\n\u03b5x\n\u223c 2\n\u221a\n\u03b5x\ny\n\u221a\npi\nexp\n[\n\u2212 y\n2\n4\u03b5x\n]\nas\ny\u221a\n\u03b5x\n\u2192\u221e,(3.16)\nwhich matches into the near-field expansion of the ray solution (3.10). Thus no new\nrays emanate from this thermal boundary layer.\n3.3. Trailing edge. The solution (3.14) fails to satisfy the boundary condition\nat the trailing edge of the plate. Hence there is a third inner region in the vicinity\nof the trailing edge, in which we use the scalings x = 1 + \u03b5x\u00af, y = \u03b5y\u00af to obtain the\nequation\n\u2202T\n\u2202x\u00af\n=\n\u22022T\n\u2202x\u00af2\n+\n\u22022T\n\u2202y\u00af2\n,(3.17)\nwith boundary conditions\nT = 1 (y\u00af = 0, x\u00af < 0),(3.18)\n\u2202T\n\u2202y\u00af\n= 0 (y\u00af = 0, x\u00af > 0),(3.19)\nT \u2192 0 at infinity,(3.20)\nHIGH-PE\u00b4CLET-NUMBER CONVECTION-DIFFUSION 129\nand a matching condition with the solution in section 3.2. This may be solved most\neasily by observing that if we write T = 1 + \u03b5\n1\n2T1, then S = \u2202T1\/\u2202y\u00af satisfies the same\nequation (3.17) in this region as T , but with boundary conditions\n\u2202S\n\u2202y\u00af\n= 0 (y\u00af = 0, x\u00af < 0),(3.21)\nS = 0 (y\u00af = 0, x\u00af > 0)(3.22)\n(where we have differentiated (3.18) along the boundary and applied (3.17) to obtain\n(3.21)). Matching with (3.15) as x\u2192 \u2212\u221e, we see that we require\nS \u2192 \u2212 1\u221a\npi\nas x\u00af\u2192 \u2212\u221e.(3.23)\nThis problem may be separated and solved in parabolic coordinates (\u03be\u00af, \u03b7\u00af) (with x\u00af =\n\u03be\u00af2 \u2212 \u03b7\u00af2, y\u00af = 2\u03be\u00af\u03b7\u00af) as for the leading edge, resulting in\nS =\n\u2202T1\n\u2202y\u00af\n= \u2212 1\u221a\npi\nerf \u03b7\u00af +\nC\u03b7\u00af\npi(\u03be\u00af2 + \u03b7\u00af2)\nexp(\u2212\u03b7\u00af2)(3.24)\nfor arbitrary constant C. Integrating, we find\nT1 = \u2212 y\u00af\u221a\npi\nerf \u03b7\u00af \u2212 2\npi\n\u03be\u00af exp(\u2212\u03b7\u00af2) + C + 1\u221a\npi\nexp(x\u00af) erf \u03be\u00af +A(x\u00af)(3.25)\nwhere A is arbitrary. However A(x\u00af) vanishes for x\u00af 6 0 from (3.18) and T1 is an\nanalytic function of (x\u00af, y\u00af), so A \u2261 0, and we must choose C = \u22121 to satisfy the\nrequirement that T1 grows subexponentially as x\u00af \u2192 +\u221e. Consequently we have the\nsolution\nT = 1\u2212\n( \u03b5\npi\n)1\/2(\ny\u00af erf \u03b7\u00af +\n2\u03be\u00af\u221a\npi\nexp(\u2212\u03b7\u00af2)\n)\n.(3.26)\nThe outer limit of this, letting x\u00af, y\u00af = O(\u03b5\u22121), is\nT = 1\u2212 \u03b5\n\u22121\/2\n\u221a\npi\ny \u2212 \u03b5\npi\n\u03be\n\u03b72\nexp(\u2212\u03b72\/\u03b5) (1 +O(\u03b5)) .(3.27)\nHere y is the original outer Cartesian coordinate and \u03be and \u03b7 are now parabolic\ncoordinates on the outer scale defined by x\u2212 1 = \u03be2 \u2212 \u03b72, y = 2\u03be\u03b7.\nLet us now try to unscramble the ray theory implications of (3.27). We can\nidentify the first term in (3.27) with that in (3.15). Indeed this identification allows\nus to think of a ray on which \u03a6 = 0 that propagates downstream from the leading\nedge.\nThe presence of the second term in (3.27) is more troublesome and the fact that\nit is of O(\u03b5\u22121\/2) necessitates the introduction of an intermediate matching region\ny = O(\u221a\u03b5), x\u2212 1 = O(\u221a\u03b5), in which (3.26) has the form\nT \u223c 1\u2212 y\u02c6\u221a\npi\n\u2212 \u03b5\n3\/4\npi\ny\u02c6\n2\u03b7\u02c63\nexp(\u2212\u03b5\u22121\/2\u03b7\u02c62)\n(\n1 +O(\u03b51\/2)\n)\n,(3.28)\nwhere \u03b7\u02c6 = \u03b5\u22121\/4\u03b7. In the intermediate region, with scaled coordinates x\u2212 1 = \u03b51\/2x\u02c6,\ny = \u03b51\/2y\u02c6, the scaled field equation is\n\u2202T\n\u2202x\u02c6\n= \u03b51\/2\n(\n\u22022T\n\u2202x\u02c62\n+\n\u22022T\n\u2202y\u02c62\n)\n(3.29)\n130 S. J. CHAPMAN, J. M. H. LAWRY, AND J. R. OCKENDON\nand so, in an expansion T \u223c T0 + \u03b51\/2T1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, the leading-order solution, T0, is\nindependent of x\u02c6. Now (3.14) implies the matching condition T \u223c erfc(y\u02c6\/2) as x\u02c6 \u2192\n\u2212\u221e, and hence\nT0 \u223c erfc\n(\ny\u02c6\n2\n)\n.\nThankfully the third term on the right-hand side of (3.28) automatically satisfies\n(3.29). Hence the solution in the intermediate region y\u02c6 = O(1), x\u02c6 = O(1) is\nT = erfc\n(\ny\u02c6\n2\n)\n+O(\u03b51\/2)\u2212 \u03b5\n3\/4\npi\ny\u02c6\n2\u03b7\u02c63\nexp(\u2212\u03b5\u22121\/2\u03b7\u02c62)\n(\n1 +O(\u03b51\/2)\n)\n.(3.30)\nNow if we take the outer limit we find\nT = 1 +O(\u03b5)\u2212 \u03b5\npi\n\u03be\n\u03b72\nexp(\u2212\u03b72\/\u03b5) (1 +O(\u03b5)) ,(3.31)\nand we have succeeded in identifying where and how to write the local solution near\nthe trailing edge in a form that can be used to match with the outer ray solution.\nEquations (3.30) and (3.31) look rather unusual in that we have neglected terms of\nalgebraic order while including exponentially small ones, but the exponentially smaller\nterms correspond to the ray from the trailing edge.\nWhen we proceed to construct a ray solution from the outer limit of (3.30), we\nfind that the first term of (3.30) tends precisely to the expression for the ray from the\nleading edge, (3.9). However the last term corresponding to the ray from the trailing\nedge is unchanged from (3.27) and may be written as\n\u03a6 =\n1\n2\n(x\u2212 1\u2212 r2), A0 = \u2212\ncot \u03b822 csc\n\u03b82\n2\npi\n\u221a\nr2\n, \u03c3 = 1,(3.32)\nFig. 3.4. Rays generated by the inner region at the trailing edge of the plate (solid line). The\nshaded region denotes the area in which the ray approximation ceases to be valid.\nwhere r2, \u03b82 are polar coordinates centered on the trailing edge x = 1, y = 0. This\ncorresponds to a fan of rays emanating from the trailing edge, as shown in Figure 3.4.\nIts leading-order amplitude coefficient A0 is negative, and hence its effect on the\nsolution is subtractive, reflecting the fact that the temperature is lower than that for\nHIGH-PE\u00b4CLET-NUMBER CONVECTION-DIFFUSION 131\na semi-infinite plate. The expression for A0 is singular along y = 0, x > 1 and this\nwill be smoothed with a further matching region in the next section. The coefficient\nof r\n\u22121\/2\n2 in the expression for A0 corresponds to a diffraction coefficient in GTD [6],\njust as (3.10) did for the leading edge. Other than the directivity function being\ndifferent, the main difference between the two rays is \u03c3: the \u201cdiffracted\u201d contribution\nfrom the front is O[\u03b51\/2 exp(\u2212r1 sin2(\u03b81\/2)\/\u03b5)] at a distance R1 and angle \u03b81 from\nthe leading edge, while that from the rear is O[\u03b5 exp(\u2212r2 sin2(\u03b82\/2)\/\u03b5)]. Note that\nthe contribution from the leading edge is always exponentially dominant over the\ncontribution from the trailing edge, except on the line y = 0, x > 1 where the leading-\nedge ray is algebraically dominant over the trailing-edge ray by a factor proportional to\n\u03b51\/2. However, both ray approximations are nonuniform in this wake or \u201cpenumbral\u201d\nregion and consequently we must analyze it locally.\n3.4. Wake behind trailing edge. In the region x\u2212 1 = O(1), y = O(\u221a\u03b5), we\nmay again use the scaled variable y\u02c6 = y\/\n\u221a\n\u03b5. Then T satisfies (3.13) to leading order.\nWe write\nX =\nx\u2212 1\n4\n, Y =\ny\u02c6\n2\n.\nThen in the region X > 0, Y > 0 we are solving\n\u2202T\n\u2202X\n=\n\u22022T\n\u2202Y 2\nto lowest order, with boundary conditions\nT = erfcY on X = 0,\n\u2202T\n\u2202Y\n= 0 on Y = 0.\nThen T\u02c7 , the cosine transform in Y of T , satisfies T\u02c7X = \u2212p2T\u02c7 with boundary condition\nT\u02c7 =\n1\np\nerfi\n(p\n2\n)\nexp\n[\n\u2212p\n2\n4\n]\nwhen X = 0,\nwhere erfi(z) = \u2212i erf(iz) is the imaginary error function. Then the solution is\nT\u02c7 =\n1\np\nerfi\n(p\n2\n)\nexp\n[\n\u2212p2\n(\nX +\n1\n4\n)]\n,\nso inverting the transform gives\nT =\n1\n2\n\u221a\npiX\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nexp\n[\n\u2212 s\n2\n4X\n]\n(erfc(s+ Y ) + erfc |Y \u2212 s|) ds(3.33)\n=\n1\n2\n\u221a\npiX\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nexp\n[\n\u2212 (s+ Y )\n2\n4X\n]\nerfc |s| ds(3.34)\nwhich is\nT =\n1\u221a\npi(x\u2212 1)\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nexp\n[\n\u2212 (2\n\u221a\n\u03b5s+ y)2\n4\u03b5(x\u2212 1)\n]\nerfc |s| ds.(3.35)\nin outer variables. Now if Y = 0 then the integral in (3.34) may be evaluated exactly:\nT =\n2\npi\ntan\u22121\n1\n2\n\u221a\nX\n=\n2\npi\ntan\u22121\n\u221a\n1\nx\u2212 1\n132 S. J. CHAPMAN, J. M. H. LAWRY, AND J. R.

Consequently the leading-order asymptotic approximation to\nthe integral is\n2\n\u221a\nX(4X + 1)\nY\nexp\n[\n\u2212 Y\n2\n4X + 1\n]\n.\nFinally the asymptotic approximation to (3.33) is\nT \u223c\n\u221a\n4X + 1\u221a\npiY\nexp\n[\n\u2212 Y\n2\n4X + 1\n]\n\u2212 8X\n3\/2\npiY 2\nexp\n[\n\u2212 Y\n2\n4X\n]\n(3.37)\nwhich, in original variables, is\nT \u223c 2\u221a\npi\n\u03b51\/2\n\u221a\nx\ny\nexp\n[\n\u2212 y\n2\n4\u03b5x\n]\n\u2212 4\u03b5\npi\n(x\u2212 1)3\/2\ny2\nexp\n[\n\u2212 y\n2\n4\u03b5(x\u2212 1)\n]\nand both terms are in ray form. Substituting with \u03b7\u02dc \u223c y\/(2\u221a\u03b5x), \u03b7\u00af \u223c y\/(2\u221a\u03b5(x\u2212 1))\nmatches each term with the outer limit of the leading and trailing edge inner solutions\n(3.9) and (3.27) exactly.\nThe genesis of the ray solution for the problem is summarized in Figure 3.5. The\nthermal boundary layer and wake can be thought of as rays tangent to the x-axis.\nAll the other rays form the two distinct families that originate from inner regions of\ndimension O(\u03b5) near the leading and trailing edges, but those at the trailing edge\nhave to penetrate an intermediate region of size O(\u03b51\/2) before they can be matched\nto the outer ray solution.\nIt is now a straightforward task to relate this scenario to irrotational flow past\nany body that can be mapped to the plate. For example, for a circular cylinder of\nunit radius, for which the conformal mapping to the plate is\n\u03b6(z) = z +\n1\nz\n.(3.38)\nThe ray paths are shown in Figure 3.6. As for the plate, there exists a thermal\nboundary layer on the cylinder and there is a thermal wake within O(\u03b51\/2) of the\ndownstream stagnation streamline.\nHIGH-PE\u00b4CLET-NUMBER CONVECTION-DIFFUSION 133\nO(\u03b5) O(\u03b5)\nflow u\n2 rays\nplate\nO(\u03b51\/2) O(\u03b51\/2)\nFig. 3.5.

Each point is the\nintersection of two rays, one from each stagnation point.\n4. Discussion and generalization. The analysis of section 3 shows that rays\nof the outer solution for the temperature can only be generated at the upstream and\ndownstream stagnation points on a smooth, isothermal body. In fact, we expect the\nsame result to apply even if the body has corners on it at which the flow speed is zero\nor infinite, just as long as it can be mapped into a flat plate. We can even cater to\nseparated Helmholtz flows, such as that past a flat plate at right angles to a stream as\nin Figure 4.1(a). We must now impose a boundary condition across the free surface\nof the flow, which we take to be a zero flux condition,\n\u2202T\n\u2202n\n= 0 on the free surface.\n134 S. J. CHAPMAN, J. M. H. LAWRY, AND J. R. OCKENDON\n(a) (b)\nFig. 4.1. (a) A separated flow (solid streamlines, dashed curves of constant velocity potential)\npast a flat plate at right angles to the flow. (b) Rays for this flow: one family from stagnation point\n(dashed) and one from each separation point (solid).\nThis means that the structure of the solution is unchanged from section 3 because\nwe may conformally map the flow to that shown in Figure 3.1(b), but with a branch\ncut extending from the trailing edge of the plate parallel to the flow. The edges\nof the regions immediately above and below the branch cut correspond to the free\nsurfaces extending from the upper and lower edges, respectively, of the plate. Since\nthe solutions which we found in sections 3.3 and 3.4 already satisfy \u2202T\/\u2202n = 0 across\nthe line y = 0 for x > 1, they are also the corresponding inner solutions in the\ncorresponding regions of the separated flow. Consequently the ray solution is also as\nconstructed for the unseparated case. Each separation point generates a fan of rays\nwhose trajectories are straight in stream-function\/velocity-potential coordinates (but\ncurved in space coordinates), as shown in Figure 4.1(b).\nThe introduction of a sufficiently small circulation around \u0393 poses no difficulties\nto our theory. Even though the flow field can no longer be mapped one-to-one to the\nuniform stream of Figure 3.1(b), the local behavior near the leading and trailing stag-\nnation points on a smooth body will be as in Figure 3.6. However, if the circulation is\nso great that a region of closed streamlines appears, a very different scenario emerges.\nNow a regular expansion is possible inside the region of closed streamlines, which\nsuggests that T is linear in \u03c8 (the stream function) there, with a thermal boundary\nlayer on the separating streamline and an inner region near the stagnation point. We\nHIGH-PE\u00b4CLET-NUMBER CONVECTION-DIFFUSION 135\nwould expect rays again to originate from the stagnation point, but now rays traveling\ninto the region of closed streamlines reflect from the body as in geometrical optics.\nThus there are again two rays through each point: one directly from the stagnation\npoint, and one which has first been reflected.\nA more difficult generalization is to viscous flow. The thermal boundary layers\nwill still not generate any extra rays, but the inner problems near the stagnation\npoints will now be more difficult to solve.\nFinally we remark that our method should apply to nonisothermal bodies. Of\nparticular mathematical interest would be cases where either the body temperature or\nthe heat flux was so rapidly varying that log T changed byO(\u03b5\u22121) on the body, or when\nthe heat transfer coefficient was O(\u03b5\u22121). In either case we would have the possibility\nthat rays from the body could penetrate the interior of the flow and completely change\nthe scenario in Figures 3.5 and 3.6.\nAcknowledgments.
