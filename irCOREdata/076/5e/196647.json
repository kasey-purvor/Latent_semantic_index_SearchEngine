This paper accordingly considers a number of important issues, widely \ndebated in the mid-nineteenth century, concerning the proper treatment of the dead in \ncrowded urban areas, whether burial was necessarily a sacred ceremony or whether enterprise \nmechanisms had a role to play and on the competing claims of alternative organisational \nforms, traditional, public and private, for the \u2018ownership\u2019 of the new social problems.  \n \nThe next section considers burial policy and practices in London up to 1832, and the third \nexamines the nature and extent of public health problems and of changes in government \nthinking concerning the alternative approaches to cemetery provision in the metropolis. The \nfourth examines the extent to which the companies concerned were able to satisfy the \nlegitimate expectations of their stakeholders, the fifth considers their ability to meet social \nexpectations concerning burial provision in central London and the final section provides \nsome conclusions. \n  \nII \n \n \nThree main factors affected the conditions in which mid-nineteenth century Londoners were \nobliged to bury their dead: the rise in urban population and the consequent pressure on burial \nspace, changes in religious practice and the rise of non-conformism, and the influence of the \nmedical profession and its desire to learn from the dissection of corpses. \n \n                                                                                                                                           4 \nThe overcrowding of London\u2019s graveyards had been noted as early as the seventeenth \ncentury. Pepys\u2019 diary entry for March 18th 1664 has him making arrangements for his \nbrother\u2019s burial and grumbling at the state of affairs;  \u2018So to my brother\u2019s, and to the church \nand with the grave-maker chose a place for my brother to lie in, just under my mother\u2019s pew. \nBut to see how a man\u2019s tombes are at the mercy of such a fellow, that for 6d he would (as his \nown words were), \u201cI will justle them together but I will make room for him\u201d speaking of the \nfullness of the middle aisle where he was to lie. And that he would for my father\u2019s sake do my \nbrother that is dead all the civility he can; which was to disturb other corps that are not quite \nrotten to make room for him\u2019.3\n \n \nThe diarist John Evelyn (1620 \u2013 1706) also noted the congestion, describing the London \nchurchyards as having \u2018dead bodies one above the other to the very top of the walls\u2019. The \nNew Churchyard had been established in 1569 outside Bishopsgate to take the overflow from \nthe often tiny churchyards of the city and Bunhill (Bonehill) Fields, where the bones from the \nSt. Paul\u2019s Cathedral charnel house had once been dumped by the cartload, had also been \nenlarged. Repeated outbreaks of plague exacerbated the problem and both Evelyn and \nChristopher Wren (unsuccessfully) proposed the creation of burial grounds outside the city. 4\n \n     \nBurial practices changed gradually. Until the mid sixteenth century the usual custom was to \nbury the corpse in the graveyard uncoffined but wrapped in a winding sheet or shroud, the \nparish coffin only being used to transport the body to the graveside in a seemly manner. \nThough a person had the right to be \u2018returned to his parent earth for dissolution and to be \ncarried thither in a decent and inoffensive manner \u2026 the time must come when the \nposthumous remains must mingle and compose a part of that soil in which they have been \ndeposited\u2019.  Coffins were otherwise reserved for vault burial within the church itself. This was \nnot a common practice until well into the seventeenth century, although it later became a \nnecessity for city churches, which sometimes took over the cellars of neighbouring properties \nwhen their own vaults were full.5\n \nAs the early Guilds and fraternities, that had once maintained the parish coffin, pall, cloaks, \ncandles and hearse and provided the saying of mass for the souls of the poor, gave way to \nburial clubs and the carpenter and general craftsmen to the undertaker - the first recorded \nbeing William Boyce, in business around the Old Bailey in 1675 - funerals grew more \nelaborate through the eighteenth century and into the Victorian era. Coffin burials became \ncustomary and the coffins themselves more solid, inhibiting the natural dissolution of the \nbody and taking up space needed for future generations.  \n \n \n                                                                                                                                           5 \nThe major pressure on burial practice was, however, demographic change. In the middle years \nof the eighteenth century, the English population began to grow rapidly; from 5.7 million in \n1750, it reached 8.6 million in 1800, 11.5 million in 1821, 15 million in 1841 and 16.5 million \nin 1850, at which time England had become by far the most densely populated of the major \nEuropean powers. This growth was due not to immigration, but was \u2018largely determined by \nfertility changes\u2019, principally the effects of earlier marriage. At the same time, life expectancy \nwas also increasing, from 36.8 years at birth in 1796 to 40.8 years in 1831. Life expectancy at \nbirth in urban areas was distinctly lower than the national average although it did improve \nover time, in London from 30 years in 1811 to 33 years in 1841 and 39 years in 1871.6\n \n  \nThe effect of the unprecedented increase in population was accentuated by a major shift from \nrural areas to the towns and cities; in 1750 London (675,000 inhabitants) and Bristol (50,000) \nwere the largest cities in England, but by 1801 there were six with a population of 50,000 \ninhabitants (London 959,000, Manchester 89,000, Liverpool, Birmingham, Bristol and Leeds) \nand in 1851 there were twenty-nine cities in Britain with a population of 50,000, nine of \nwhich had a population of over 100,000. At the end of this period, more Britons were living in \ntowns than in the country, one-third of them in cities of over 50,000 people.7\n  \n   \nThis concentration of population growth in the urban areas caused the most severe social \nproblems and life expectancies in the worst urban areas could be twenty years lower than in \nrural districts. Housing conditions were often appalling and drainage, sewage and water \nsupply problems resulted in very poor standards of public health, with widespread disease, \nincluding the re-emergence of cholera in 1831. In 1840, London had a population of \n1,870,727 and, of the daily death rate of 125, nine people a day died from old age and three \nfrom violence and most of the rest from disease in some form. The population was at its \nyoungest in 1826, when forty per cent of the population was under fifteen, but this did not \nlower the burial rate as much as might be assumed because the rates of death from disease \nwere so high amongst children; 46 per cent of the total deaths in 1840 in London were \nchildren aged under fifteen.8\n \n   \nThe consequences of these changes are vividly exemplified by experiences at two burial \nplaces within a hundred yards of one another in the London parish of St. Clement Danes. The \nparish acquired the Green Ground in 1638 as additional burial space before the area became \nfashionable and the open fields and gardens surrounding the burial ground were developed. \nThe area later deteriorated into a slum and the Green Ground burial ground, hemmed in by \ncrumbling tenement buildings and adjacent to a workhouse, was used by Dickens in Bleak \nHouse to symbolise corruption; this \u2018reeking tunnel of a court \u2026 with every villainy of life in \n                                                                                                                                           6 \naction close on death and every poisonous element of death in action close on life\u2019.9  The \nEnon Baptist Chapel in Clements Lane, a hundred yards from the Green Ground, was opened \nprimarily for dissenters in 1823, although it offered cheap burial for those of any \ndenomination. This quickly became a scandal; \u2018nearly 12,000 bodies in wooden coffins had \nbeen buried in pits, the uppermost of which were separated from the worshippers by \nfloorboards and a few inches of earth. Children attending Sunday school in the chapel were \nplagued by thousands of black flies, which had crawled out of the coffins beneath. The stench \nwas often intolerable\u2019.  The problems were, in fact, even worse; many bodies had already \nbeen disposed of into the Thames, by means of the sewer over which the chapel had been \nbuilt.10\n \n   \nUp until the early 1800s it seems that the state of this and other inner London graveyards, \nmalodorous neighbours to the living, so crowded that it was impossible to dig without \ndisturbing other, recent graves, was noted but accepted as inevitable. By the 1820s, however, \nincreasing concern for public health in towns was combining with an awareness that such \nthings were better arranged in France, where their large cemeteries were situated outside the \ncity boundaries. In London, the unsanitary conditions and the prevalence of fever in the \nimmediate proximity of the graveyards were seized upon by many campaigners, including the \nproponent of the miasmic theory of disease, Dr. John Armstrong, who believed that the \ncontagion from putrifying remains was born through the air via mists and foul vapours, rather \nthan by water.  \n \nChange in religious attitudes was another major influence on burial practice. Although Henry \nVIII initiated the English Reformation by breaking with the Church of Rome, it wasn\u2019t until \nhis death in 1547 that Protestant reform began to gather pace. Cranmer\u2019s Book of Common \nPrayer (1552) embodied, among other innovations, radical changes to the Order for the Burial \nof the Dead; the service itself was removed from the church to the graveyard and all evidence \nof the old belief in Purgatory and prayers for the souls of the dead was excised from the \nliturgy. Reforms were temporarily reversed under Mary (and their architect, Cranmer, burnt at \nthe stake in 1556), but the developments were continued and consolidated through the \nElizabethan period and accelerated during the Interregnum.  \n \nThe eighteenth century brought the Enlightenment and, in some quarters, a turning away from \nsuperstition and intolerance; hellfire and fear of death retreated before the light of reason, \nbenevolent angels increasingly replaced skeletons on funerary monuments and falling asleep, \npeacefully and eternally, became the dominant metaphor for dying. Life-spans lengthened as \nmaterial prosperity, at least for some, increased; freed from, or deprived of, spiritual care for \n                                                                                                                                           7 \nthe immortal souls of their dead, the better-off sections of the population turned to the \nmaterial world for consolation, relying on increasingly elaborate funerals and monuments to \ngive meaning and direction to the process of mourning. \n \nThe eighteenth century also brought the rise of the dissenting religious groups that refused \nAnglicanism \u2013 Quakers, Baptists, Congregationalists, Episcopalians, Unitarians, Presbyterians \nand Methodists, these last being the largest group, with 76,000 members by the time of \nWesley\u2019s death in 1791. These non-conformists appealed particularly to the working classes \nwith their open-air sermons, lay preachers and emphasis on hard work and self\u2013denial and \nwere also linked to the new trade union movement and to other political groups like the \nChartists. By the beginning of the nineteenth century these groups were large enough to \ninfluence changes in burial rites, the most important of which concerned the issue of \nconsecrated ground. \n \nAnglican churches had long provided, by law, burial for all Christians of whatever \ndenomination in the consecrated ground of their graveyards and cemeteries. By the same law \ntheir clergy were forbidden to bury suicides or the unbaptised or to officiate on unconsecrated \nground. The income generated by burial fees had always been important to church finances; \nin post-Reformation London, rates varied from parish to parish and within each parish \naccording to a complex set of conditions, such as location of burial within the churchyard, \ncoffined or sheeted burial, adult or child, parishioner or stranger. Sometimes these fees \ncontributed directly to the income of the minister; responding to the tithe enquiry of 1638, the \nminister of St. Botolph Aldgate explained that he depended on burial fees to the extent that \u2018I \nmust say, if people do not die I cannot live\u2019.11\n \n  \nNon-conformists resented having to pay parish rates and burial fees to enrich the Anglican \nChurch, when their own ministers were unable to officiate at services on consecrated ground. \nSeparate provision for dissenters was minimal; though Bunhill Fields was known as their \nburial ground, it was actually open to all, while graveyards attached to chapels were rare.  In \nthe early nineteenth-century, dissenters began to campaign for their own burial grounds; in \n1819 the first non-denominational cemetery was laid out in Norwich and in 1820 a joint-stock \nventure founded a cemetery for Dissenters in Rusholm, Manchester. These were pioneering \nendeavours and provided, along with the French cemeteries, the models on which the first \nprivate cemeteries in London would be based.         \n \nThe third strand in the web of circumstances surrounding the burial of the dead in nineteenth \ncentury London led from advances in medical knowledge to activities that were regarded with \n                                                                                                                                           8 \nhorror by most of the population, rich or poor, educated or ignorant. In order to learn their \ntrade, students of medicine needed to dissect fresh corpses. The only lawful source of this \ncommodity was the gallows and, since 1752, not just any hanged felon (there were nearly a \nhundred capital offences on the statute books in 1823) but only those hanged for murder. 12 \nDissection had been the ultimate punishment for murder since the Murder Act of 1752, which \nstipulated that convicted murderers were to be hanged within 48 hours and dissected \nafterwards.13\n \n     \nLater in the eighteenth century, when surgeon-anatomists had established schools of anatomy \nand lawful subjects for dissection were hard to come by, it was natural for entrepreneurs to \nstep in and supply the market from a more convenient source, the graveyards, especially those \nof the large towns and cities where the anatomy schools themselves were situated. These \nentrepreneurs were the body snatchers or resurrection men; exemplars of an \u2018innovative \nmarket logic\u2019, their relations with their paying clients, the surgeons, were covert and uneasy \nand they were held in utter abhorrence by a public grown increasingly aware of their \nactivities.  Ruth Richardson, in particular, has studied the history and effects of grave robbery, \nespecially on the poor, for it was the bodies of the poor, often buried in communal pits in \nflimsy coffins in the crowded inner city graveyards, that were the easiest targets for body \nsnatchers. The example of Laurence Sterne illustrates the scope and efficiency of their \noperations; Sterne died in March 1768 and was buried in the graveyard of St. Georges, \nHanover Square, apparently in a pauper\u2019s grave, in spite of his fame as author of the anti-\nnovel, Tristram Shandy. Four days later \u2018a professor of anatomy at Cambridge gave an \nillustrated lecture with a cadaver, which an acquaintance of Sterne\u2019s was shocked to recognise \nas the writer\u2019s corpse. Sterne was quietly reburied\u2019.14\n \n \nUndertakers and funeral directors moved in to provide those able to pay with the means to \nsecure the bodies of their relatives against resurrectionist predations \u2013 triple coffins (wood, \nlead, wood), metal coffins, wooden coffins bound with iron, iron cages completely enclosing \nthe coffin, huge weights over the grave \u2013 all costly solutions and in any case redundant after \nthe period it took for a body to decay beyond the point of usefulness to anatomists. Guards \ncould be set over the grave or the bodies stored in secure dead-houses for the necessary \nperiod, although all these solutions greatly increased the funeral expenses and none was proof \nagainst the possibility of bribes to replace bodies in the coffin by weights or sand or otherwise \nsubvert the arrangements.  \n \nThe poor, without access to expensive precautions, mixed the newly turned earth above the \ncoffin with sticks and straw to impede the wooden shovels of the body snatchers, or they \n                                                                                                                                           9 \nbanded together in communal watch over their churchyard, or placed tiny unobtrusive \nmarkers on a grave to show whether it had been disturbed. \n \nHuman bodies were sold for fixed sums, sometimes by the inch, sometimes dismembered and \nsold limb by limb but, by a strange anomaly of the law, a dead person was no-one\u2019s property \nand so, in law, no theft was involved unless grave clothes had been taken along with the body.  \nIn 1822 William Cobbett noted the anomaly; \u2018to steal the body of a sheep, or pig, or calf, or \nox, or fowl of any sort, is a capital felony, punished with DEATH, and \u2026 to receive any such \nbody, or to have it in your possession, knowing it to be stolen, is also a felony, punished with \nTRANSPORTATION\u2019 yet grave-robbery was treated leniently by judges. Vaughan, the \nLondon body snatcher, for example, received six months in prison for his part in multiple \nrobberies from one Yarmouth graveyard (and his client, the eminent surgeon-anatomist Sir \nAstley Cooper, paid him an allowance during his sentence). Body snatchers had more to fear \nfrom the violence of outraged public feeling than from the Law; on at least one occasion, \nthose caught in the act chose prison to save them from the mob.15\n \n  \nPublic concern was growing. Feelings of outrage combined with distrust of the medical \nprofession, willing participants, it seemed, in acts of desecration that offended against \nmorality, decency and the natural human need to honour the dead. It was time something was \ndone; in 1828, after years of lobbying from the Anatomical Society (formed by a group of \neminent surgeon-anatomists), a Select Committee on Anatomy was appointed to investigate \nthe supply of subjects for dissection with the object of presenting a Bill to Parliament.  \n \nDebate raged through the pages of the Times, the Lancet and other journals, bringing some \nvery muddy prejudices to the surface in the process. The medical profession was unhappy \nabout its association with the hangman and with the concept of dissection as punishment, the \nultimate \u2018mark of infamy\u2019. But if not the bodies of hanged murderers then whose bodies \nshould be used? Many argued that the most convenient source of supply would be the \nunclaimed bodies of paupers, those who died in the workhouse without friend or relative to \nclaim them (or at least, none who could afford to pay for a funeral). After all, as one observer \npointed out, \u2018the unclaimed \u2026 are mostly those whose lives have been vicious and characters \nabandoned \u2013 the prostitute, the vagrant, and the sot. If any are to suffer after death for the \ncommunity, it should surely be those who have contributed evil rather than good to it when \nliving\u2019.  Other medical men expressed horror at \u2018so degrading, and at the same time so \nuncalled for an expedient\u2019. Cobbett used the columns of his Political Register to weigh in on \nthe side of the poor; \u2018the unfortunate persons who die in poor houses and hospitals have, in \nnumerous cases seen better days \u2026 every working man \u2026 pays full one-half of his wages in \n                                                                                                                                           10 \ntaxes and therefore, when he becomes so poor, helpless and destitute as to die in a poor house, \nit is unjust, cruel, barbarous to the last degree, to dispose of his body to be cut up like that of a \nmurderer\u2019. The objections of the poor to the fate prepared for them were the consequences, \nsome claimed, of mere \u2018ignorance and prejudice\u2019. The Paisley Reform Society presented a \npetition to Parliament which directly addressed this hypocrisy;  \u2018the Petitioners respectfully \nsuggest, that those whose education and habits have got the better of their prejudices may be \ncalled upon to make the sacrifice; if to come under the knife be of no consequence, why do \nmedical men take such pains to be sheltered from its incisions? Surely it cannot be expected \nthat the poor will be jeered out of their feeling of abhorrence for a system which the rich, the \nwise and the powerful take such extraordinary care to guard against\u2019.16\n \n  \nOne last terror was to be added to the disquiet of the time before the issue was settled. A pair \nof body snatchers was found to have taken the logical step of murder in order to provide their \nclient-anatomist with really fresh subjects. In eleven months in 1827\u201328, Burke and Hare \ncommitted seventeen murders in Edinburgh and sold the corpses to Dr. Robert Knox of the \nEdinburgh Medical College.17\n \n The first Anatomy Bill failed in the House of Lords in 1829, \nopposed by the Archbishop of Canterbury but, amid continuing controversy, a second Bill \npassed through Parliament, to become the Anatomy Act 1832, which permitted the bodies of \nthe unclaimed poor to be taken for dissection.  \n \n \nIII \n \n \nDuring the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as \u2018most industries made the transition from \nmercantile to industrial capitalism by concentrating production\u2019, business and social life \npresented a series of major challenges. Some saw the solution as self-help and personal \nenterprise, at least on the part of those who already had some capital, the middle classes, but \nothers increasingly looked to broader and more sophisticated organisational forms, \nparticularly during the early years of the nineteenth century. Remarkable population growth in \nthe urban areas brought real urgency to the question and there were wide-ranging public \ndebates on who should \u2018own\u2019 these problems and how this ownership could be supported, \nencouraged and financed.18\n \n \nAlthough the rapid changes were driven by the new manufacturing industries, these \nbusinesses typically required only modest amounts of capital and often continued to rely on \n                                                                                                                                           11 \nthe familiar mechanisms of family capitalism and local networks of personal acquaintance \nand trust. Instead, it was the infra-structural complexity of a rapidly urbanising Britain that \nprovoked the more innovative responses and Foreman-Peck and Millward have argued that it \nwas the \u2018network technology industries\u2019 in particular, with their large, sunk capital costs \n(relative to total costs) and need for unified systems that raised really \u2018distinctive problems\u2019 \nfor government policy.19\n \n  \nCorporate personality, the existence of an organisation separate and distinct from its \nmembers, was a feature of several types of organization, such as the church, the craft guild \nand the town, well before its adoption by joint stock companies, although the ruin of the \nSouth Sea Company and the passing of the \u2018Bubble Act\u2019 of 1719-20 set back the possibilities \nfor incorporation (by limiting the membership of a partnership to six and forbidding the \nformation of unincorporated joint-stock enterprises) until 1825, when the Act was repealed. \nUntil the second half of the nineteenth century, companies could acquire their legal status, and \nthe privilege of limited liability, only through Royal Charter (chartered companies) or by Act \nof Parliament (statutory companies). Over time, Parliament gradually widened its powers, \nincluding the granting of rights to limited liability but generally chose to restrict these \naccommodations to activities that both needed substantial amounts of capital and would \nprovide considerable social benefit (and where compulsory powers over land acquisition, or \ndigging up roads were involved). It was not until the passing of the Limited Liability Act \n1855 and the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 that limited liability companies could be \nformed by simple registration.20\n \n  \nIn London the most important of the emerging, network technologies were the treatment and \nsupply of water, with great potential for improving public health conditions and gas lighting \n(the early gas industry was far more concerned with lighting than with heating), also \nbeneficial to public safety. Both technologies needed substantial amounts of capital to \nestablish their networks. The first water company in London was the Chelsea Waterworks \nCompany, formed in 1723, which drew water directly from the Thames and pumped the water \nto the slightly higher ground of the wealthy West End. There were serious concerns over the \ncleanliness of the water and further companies were approved by Parliament from 1806. The \nfirst company to be formed in the gas industry, the London Gaslight and Coke Company, was \nestablished in 1812 by Royal Charter and \u2018numerous companies were established during the \n1820s\u2019 in the metropolis, mostly as statutory companies.21\n \n  \nPrivate enterprise was initially seen as the appropriate mechanism for the development of the \nurban water and gas industries, but \u2018competition, the accepted remedy for the evils of \n                                                                                                                                           12 \nmonopoly, was found to be unsatisfactory [and] the attitude of Parliament towards private \nenterprise in certain activities underwent a change during the 1830s and 1840s\u2019 as market and \nregulatory failures, or \u2018negative externalities\u2019, became apparent. A number of public health \nreports published in the early 1840s \u2018demonstrated clearly the connection between bad water \nsupplies and ill health\u2019 and indicated that the incentives that would motivate a private \nenterprise firm, for example to sell water, could not readily reflect the considerable social \ncosts of deteriorations in public health caused by a lack of clean water or of fire damage if \nwater was not readily available in (say) the poorer parts of town. It also became clear, at least \nin industries where infra-structural costs were so important to the volume of business activity, \nthat competition caused considerable (and predictable) waste. In the gas industry, for \nexample, the wasteful duplication of mains, the notoriously violent behaviour of the gangs \ninstalling the mains of rival companies and the repeated breaking up of roads came to \ndiscredit competition as the obvious mechanism for its development. An influential \ncommissioners report written in 1847 concluded that \u2018the existence in the same town of two \nrival Gas Companies does not appear to us at all calculated to benefit the consumers\u2019. \nAttempts to achieve a compromise position, by controlling the profit or dividend levels of \nprivate companies, also failed, in the face of a company\u2019s ability to make use of practices \nsuch as capital watering in order to negate the intended controls.22\n \n  \nAt the same time that competition was seen to be failing, the municipalities were growing in \nstature. In the first quarter of the nineteenth century, population influxes had \u2018submerged \ntraditional parish government in several cities including the crowded areas of the Metropolis\u2019 \nbut there were major changes to the structure of English local government \u2018following the \nextensions of suffrage in 1832 to the middle class\u2019. The treatment of the poor was transformed \nby the Poor Law Act of 1834 and the mechanisms of local government by the passing of the \n1835 Municipal Corporations Act, although the latter did not apply to London. The \nmunicipalities were now able to respond directly to the needs of the local population and, \nafter a number of survey officer reports on gas bills after 1845 criticised the pricing policies \nof private companies, the municipalities began to take over the responsibility for gas and \nwater provision. In particular, they were able to set lower prices than commercial companies, \nin order to serve \u2018as many consumers as possible, at prices as near to the costs of production \nas can possibly be estimated\u2019.23\n \n  \nThus, what has been seen as a \u2018changing attitude towards municipal trading after the 1840s\u2019, \nas a belief in competition gave way to increased municipalisation and regulation was, as \nMatthews has argued, less a change in public attitude than a rational reaction to economic \nrealities in the industries concerned.24  \n                                                                                                                                           13 \n \nThis was very much the case in London, even though it was \u2018left outside the range of the great \nlocal government reforms of 1835 and such pioneer social and administrative legislation as \nthe Public Health Act of 1848\u2019. Edwin Chadwick, Secretary to the Poor Law Commission, \nwhose reports in 1843 and 1849 had helped to shape public opinion, was very much in favour \nof handing the control of London\u2019s water supply and health problems to a \u2018small executive \nCommission appointed by the Crown\u2019 and the Royal Commission on the Corporation of \nLondon in 1854 argued strongly that the creation of a \u2018gigantic new elected local authority for \nLondon was unwise and impractical\u2019. This led to the passing of the Metropolitan Local \nManagement Act of 1855, which placed most duties regarding sanitation and public health in \nthe hands of a Metropolitan Board of Works.25\n \n  \nThese general patterns, it will be argued, did not only affect the water supply and gas \nindustries, or the \u2018network technology industries\u2019 more generally, because the defining \ncharacteristics that Foreman-Peck and Millward identify (high fixed costs, consequently \nlower unit costs the higher the volume of output and the absence of an effective second-hand \nmarket for asset sales such that investments were effectively \u2018sunk costs\u2019) could also be found \nin other businesses, including burial provision in the metropolis in the early nineteenth \ncentury.26\n \n  \nThe debate about London\u2019s burial conditions intensified in the early 1830s.  George Carden, a \nLondon barrister, had been an enthusiastic advocate of the French system on the Pere \nLaChaise model and he now persuaded several influential and wealthy Londoners to back a \nscheme for the purchase of land on the outskirts of the city for a cemetery that would provide \nsecurity, space and peace in a tranquil landscape. Lobbying began straight away.27\n \n The \ngovernment was initially unmoved but an outbreak of Asiatic cholera and the return of the \nplague pit system of the 1660s to the capital in October 1831brought added urgency to the \ndebate and a Bill establishing a \u2018General Cemetery for the Interment of the Dead in the \nNeighbourhood of the Metropolis\u2019 was passed by Parliament in July 1832.   \nThis encouraged other promoters and, by 1841, cemeteries had been established on the edge \nof the city by the following private sector companies (see Table 1 for details of the level of \ntheir shareholdings and for other financial information) :  \n                                                                                                                                           14 \nthe General Cemetery Company, which established All Souls\u2019 Cemetery, Kensal Green \nHarrow Road, W.10, north of Notting Hill in 1833 [hereafter Kensal Green];  \nthe South Metropolitan Cemetery Company, which set up the South Metropolitan Cemetery, \nNorwood High Street, S.E.27, near Lewisham in 1837 [Norwood];  \nthe London Cemetery Company, which set up both St. James Cemetery, Swains Lane, \nHighgate N.6 in 1839 [Highgate] and All Saints\u2019 Cemetery, Linden Grove, Nunhead, S.E.15, \nsouth of New Cross in 1840 [Nunhead];  \nthe West of London and Westminster Cemetery Company, which owned Brompton \nCemetery, Old Brompton Road, S.W.5, between Kensington and Chelsea in 1840 \n[Brompton]; \nAbney Park Cemetery Company, which built Abney Park Cemetery South Lodge, Stoke \nNewington High Street, N.16, between Clapton and Holloway in 1840 [Abney Park] and \nthe City of London and Tower Hamlets Cemetery Company, which established Tower \nHamlets Cemetery, Southern Grove, Mile End, E.3, between West Ham and Stepney in 1841 \n[Tower Hamlets]. \n \nThe Church of England, through its bishops, had expressed their concerns to the government \nat the potential threat to the burial fees paid to their parish churches and they duly announced \nthat they would not consecrate any of the private sector cemeteries unless their right to burial \nincome was legally guaranteed by suitable clauses in an enabling Act of Parliament.  Only \ndissenters could be buried in non-consecrated ground and all but one of the companies were \naccordingly formed by Act of Parliament, so as to be able to offer Anglican burial services.28\n \n  \nThus, the Bill whereby the General Cemetery Company was formed required the company to \n\u2018reimburse the London parishes from which they had \u201cpoached\u201d clients at up to 5 shillings per \nburial\u2019, close to the average burial fee in 1830-32 across several London parishes of 6s 2d. \nThe importance of burial fees to the parish clergy in London can be seen from the fact that \nthey averaged about \u20a4165 per annum in the period 1838-40, although varying enormously  \n(from \u20a4445 to just under \u20a420) from parish to parish.29\n \n   \nThe private sector London cemeteries offered far more space for burials than had previously \nbeen available in the city. The first, the 54 acre site at Kensal Green, was \u2018twenty times bigger \nthan anything that had previously existed in London\u2019 and each of the other cemeteries was at \nleast thirty acres in area, so that the collective provision was close to 300 acres.30 The General \nCemetery Company had been established with an authorised capital of \u00a345,000 in \u00a325 shares \nand the other cemeteries required broadly similar amounts of financial support, ranging from \n\u00a335,000 (in \u00a310 shares) at Abney Park to \u00a375,000 (in \u00a325 shares) at Norwood. Land purchase \n                                                                                                                                           15 \ncosts were considerable but at least as much capital had to be spent on improvements to the \nsites so as to meet or even exceed public expectations.  At Abney Park, for example, the land \ncost \u00a310,850 and a further \u00a36,000 had to be spent on roads and drainage.  The General \nCemetery Company spent about a fifth of its capital in purchasing, in September 1832, some \nfifty acres of heavy London clay hayfields in rural Middlesex for \u00a39,500.  The site, between \nthe Harrow Road and the Grand Junction Canal, then had to be worked on, with payments of \n\u00a31000 to the Grand Junction to \u2018turn the canal\u2019 and \u00a38,517 to construct a suitable wall around \nthe cemetery before the grounds could be consecrated and opened for business in January \n1833.31\n  \n  \nAs the disturbance of graves by body snatchers was a serious concern of the bereaved in the \nearly years of the commercial cemeteries, high walls were standard, but were not always \nenough in themselves; at Norwood, the two-mile long, twelve-foot high brick wall was \nsupplemented by the employment of a night-watchman, equipped with an alarm rattle that \ncould be heard more than half a mile away.32 Drainage was also a problem, as each of the \ncemeteries was built on poor-draining London clay. This required the laying-in of quite \nelaborate drainage systems; at Abney Park, for example, good drainage was only achieved \nwhen a well-shaft 25 feet deep was sunk into the clay at the lower end of the site.33\n \n \nAll the cemeteries opened for business when their facilities were only partially complete, in \norder to establish some cash inflows before going on to complete the remaining building \nwork. Thus, at Kensal Green, it took until July 1837 until the chapel, colonnade and catacomb \nhad been built and the ground \u2018cleared of building materials of every description\u2019. At \nBrompton, the promoters took over the site of a former brickfield in 1837 and began burials in \n1840 but, three years later, twice the projected capital costs (of \u00a331,000) had been spent \nwithout completing the original design.34 At Kensal Green, particular attention was paid to the \narchitectural quality of the various buildings but the other cemetery companies also built \nchapels, colonnades and catacombs of great distinction. Highgate was noted for its \nextraordinary neo-Egyptian catacombs and at Brompton a splendid Anglican chapel was built, \nalthough lack of funds prevented the construction of the intended non-conformist and Roman \nCatholic chapels. The architect at Norwood was Sir William Tite, who worked in the Tudor \nGothic style while, at Abney Park the architecturally distinguished site with its Egyptian \nRevival iron entrance gates was designed by Professor William Hosking.35\n \n  \nMost of the companies wanted to offer their customers a choice of burial in either consecrated \nor un-consecrated land, even though this complicated the layout of their cemeteries. Kensal \nGreen, for example, set aside 15 of its 54 acres for dissenters with the remainder reserved for \n                                                                                                                                           16 \nAnglicans, at Norwood about one-fifth of the site was kept for the use of non-conformists but \nat Nunhead only the north-west corner was kept for dissenters, while no more than five per \ncent of the early burials at Tower Hamlets, the most working class of the seven cemeteries, \nwere made in un-consecrated ground.36\n \n \nThe Abney Park company, although formed in 1838-39 to \u2018provide a place of interment \n(removed from a crowded neighbourhood) for all classes of the community and all \ndenominations of Christians\u2019 for the City of London and its eastern and north-eastern suburbs, \nwas actually founded and promoted by Congregationalists who objected, as a matter of \nprinciple, to consecration. The company\u2019s founders were keen to avoid the segregation of \nJews, Catholics and Dissenters from Anglicans, which would have \u2018marred [its] silent \nassembly of equals\u2019 and this stance proved popular with non-conformists, making it the \nlogical successor to Bunhill Fields. It also meant that Abney Park\u2019s funerals could be cheaper \nthan those of its competitors, which helped its business to expand rapidly once burials began \nin May 1840. The company also felt that the experiences of the first of the cemeteries at \nKensal Green had demonstrated that the payment of \u2018exorbitant fees to the clergy of those \nparishes whence the deceased had originated in order to make up their lost income from \ntraditional burial rights \u2026 and consecration by a bishop of the established church \u2026 [were] \nRituals which possessed neither basis in law nor conferred any spiritual advantages on the \ninterred\u2019.37\n \n \nIV  \n \n \nThis section of the paper examines the extent to which the private sector cemetery companies \nwere able to satisfy the legitimate expectations of their stakeholders, across the period from \nthe opening of the first, the General Cemetery Company, in 1833 until 1852, when the \ngovernment passed the Burial of the Dead in the Metropolis Act, which enabled municipal \nBurial Boards to establish cemeteries and to begin to buy up private sector cemetery \ncompanies within the terms of the Metropolitan Interments Act of 1850. \n \nThe expectations of stakeholders reflect the purposes for which the business entity was \ncreated. Limited liability companies generally operate for the commercial benefit of their \nshareholders although they do also constitute a device that can be used mainly to promote the \npublic good. Private cemeteries, primarily to meet the preferences of non-conformists, had \nalready been opened in Liverpool, at the Necropolis in 1825 and at St James Cemetery in \n1825-29 before any of the London cemetery companies were promoted and by 1830, they \n                                                                                                                                           17 \nwere paying dividends of 12.5 and 8 per cent respectively, highly commercial rates of return \nfor the time.38\n \n  \nRugg has argued that it is a mistake to assume that, because nineteenth century cemetery \ncompanies paid out dividends, they were primarily profit-motivated. Cemetery companies in \nBritain, she argued, \u2018had a unique mixture of motivation for taking action\u2019 and each could, in \nprinciple, be located somewhere along an axis \u2018from the highest religious principles to basic \ncommercial exploitation\u2019 although she also found it convenient for analytical purposes to \nallocate companies to one of three groups; those in which public health matters had priority, \nthose founded by entrepreneurs wanting to exploit particular markets for burials and thirdly \nthose enterprises set up to serve specific religious denominations. The likelihood of a given \ncompany being allocated to a particular group was itself influenced by the date it was formed; \nin the period 1820-38, the most important desires were to protect corpses from disturbance \n(particularly before the passing of Warburton\u2019s Anatomy Act in 1832, which ended the \ncriminal trade in cadavers) and to meet the long-standing burial grievances of Dissenters, so \nthat it was \u2018only in the mid-1830s that the purely speculative cemetery emerged\u2026the new \ntype of enterprise which appeared in 1835 was founded in the confident expectation of profit, \nsince earlier companies had proved to be financially successful \u2026 speculation in burials was a \nlimited phenomenon, which affected London, Manchester and Scotland only \u2026 [and] \ngenerally followed  the periodic investment booms which occurred in the mid-1830s and mid-\n1840s\u2019. Rugg found that 32 per cent of private cemetery companies could be classified as \nbeing profit-motivated, including each of the London companies formed in the period 1832-\n41.39\n  \n  \nIn London, the sums of money needed for cemetery promotion were certainly beyond the \nreach of semi-charitable involvement. The promoters were often commercial rather than \nphilanthropic people; Stephen Geary, for example, who promoted both the London Cemetery \nCompany and the West of London and Westminster Cemetery Company, also built London\u2019s \nfirst gin palace and was as much an entrepreneur as an architect. Geary\u2019s successor, James \nBunning, who was also surveyor to the Thames Tunnel and architect of the Coal Exchange, \nhad a commercial outlook, as did the builder, Nowell who was a major investor in the \nBrompton cemetery and John Pirie, ship-owner and Mayor of London in 1841, who was one \nof the promoters of the Tower Hamlets cemetery.40  The South Metropolitan was also seen as \nhaving \u2018the intention of making profits by selling status burials, this time to the south of the \nriver\u2019 and, more generally, the annual general meetings of each of the cemetery companies \nwere entirely businesslike in the orthodox capitalist manner.41\n \n \n                                                                                                                                           18 \nPromoters of the time would have seen no particular contradiction between the seeking of \ncommercial gains and providing for the public benefit, given the dominant features of the \nclass system of that time. Wealth was concentrated in the hands of the middle and upper-\nclasses; a pervasive route of modern capitalism, whereby profit is maximised by selling \nproducts and services to large numbers of working people with readily disposable spending \npower, was not then available and those who promoted the cemeteries would have seen the \nprovision of burial facilities within a landscape that would appeal to middle-class sentiments \n(with some limited provision for common interment) as fully consistent with profit \nmaximisation, since the poor had little spending power anyway. Those present at meetings of \nthe cemetery companies were clearly aware that dividends would only be forthcoming if a \ngood-quality public service was provided and Stephen Geary was quite explicit that the \nlandscaping of the company\u2019s cemeteries at Brompton, Highgate and Nunhead and the \nconstruction of vaults and catacombs at the highest point of the last two grounds was \u2018vital to \nthe success of the enterprise\u2019.42\n \n \nThe promoters understood that theirs was an acutely sunk cost business that would only be \nprofitable if there was a sufficient volume of demand; in May 1842 the directors of Kensal \nGreen, for example, reported to their shareholders that they were going to offer seven acres of \ntheir land for the burial of the poor, as the land could support 133,500 graves, each of which \nwould take ten coffins so that 1,335,000 \u2018deceased paupers\u2019 could be provided for. Their \ncommercial optimism was such that they could also point out that the land, \u2018at an average of \n1000 burials a year will not be filled for 1,335 years\u2019.43 Cost-cutting was a regular response to \ninsufficient profit levels; at Brompton in 1844, the directors both increased the charges for \ncommon interments and \u2018introduced the most rigid system of economy into the working \ndepartment of the cemetery\u2019 while at Kensal Green the directors \u2018entered into a minute \ninvestigation of the several items of labour and expenditure connected with the cemetery\u2019 as it \n\u2018had been the constant object of the directors to keep down the expenses\u2019.44\n \n  \nThere were considerable variabilities in the trade that impacted on the financial returns that \nthe individual cemeteries were able to generate for their investors. The burial fees themselves \nvaried; the church of St. Mary, Stratford-le-Bow charged 12s for adult parishioner burials in \nits churchyard, Enon Chapel 14s, Spa Fields 14s, Abney Park 21s and Kensal Green and \nBrompton 25s. All charged more for private or brick graves and catacombs (Brompton, for \nexample charged \u00a312 for a place in its catacombs). Tower Hamlets required all corpses buried \nin their chapel vault to be in a lead coffin, or in pitch half an inch thick, between an interior \nand exterior coffin of wood. Even the size of graves was variable; most were 6ft 6in by 2ft 6in \n                                                                                                                                           19 \nbut they could be as much as 9ft by 4 ft, while the depth was anything from 7ft to 20ft, with \n10ft being common.45\n \n  \nThese operational factors were of relatively modest significance in comparison with the initial \ninvestment decisions concerning the suitability and appeal of the proposed site to its future \ncustomers and the control of the related expenditures on buildings, drainage and the security \nof the site and the graves it would contain. Despite their ultimately commercial motivation, \nthe private cemeteries took a long-term view of their prospects and there are few, if any, \nindications that they provided burial sites that were aesthetically unsatisfactory, particularly \nwhen compared with the old city graveyards. Each provided a large, relatively peaceful, \ngarden-like area within which there was plenty of room for new burials for the foreseeable \nfuture. Inevitably, given their relative proximity to densely-populated urban areas, there were \nsome variations in the detachment of the various sites from everyday life. The cemetery on \nNunhead Hill, for example, was next to a small hamlet surrounded by market gardens and \nopen fields and commanded splendid views of the city while Abney Park took over the site of \ntwo large seventeenth century houses and was able to supplement the existing plantings to \nsuch an extent that the resulting arboretum (of 2500 species, each named for the information \nof visitors) became a noted attraction; Kensal Green, however, was next to both a canal and \nrailway company. Discussions ensured that these activities interfered as little as possible with \nthe peace and quiet of the cemetery although in 1845 the ambience deteriorated somewhat \nwhen the proprietors were unable to prevent the construction nearby of a gasometer by the \nWestern Gas Light Company.46\n \n  \nThere was some variation in the \u2018market niche\u2019 that was sought by the various companies, \nalthough this was more a matter of emphasis than deliberate market segmentation, as catering \nfor a range of burial preferences made obvious business sense. Tower Hamlets, the most \nworking class of the cemeteries, was never seen as fashionable and provided mainly common \ninterments for the local communities of Tower Hamlets, West Ham, Hackney, the City of \nLondon, Westminster and Holborn. Nunhead did not really cater for the burial of London\u2019s \nsocial elite but Kensal Green, on the other hand, was seen as a fashionable place of burial, \nattracted the \u2018cream of the West End trade\u2019 and would soon provide the first Royal burials in \na commercial cemetery (two children of King George III, the Duke of Sussex in 1843 and \nPrincess Sophia in 1848), although this did not discourage them from offering seven acres of \ntheir grounds to the adjacent parishes in 1842 on a long-term basis for the burial of the poor.47\n \n  \nIn order to assess the level of business and the returns thereon that the private sector \ncompanies were able to generate, data was sought across the twenty-year period 1833 to 1852.    \n                                                                                                                                           20 \nRelevant business records were obtained from both public depositories and private sources for \nfour of the six companies, the General Cemetery Company (which opened its cemetery in \n1833), the South Metropolitan Company, which began trading in 1837, the West of London \nand Westminster Company, which opened its cemetery at Brompton in 1840 (and was bought \nout by the government in 1852) and Abney Park (1840).48\n \n \nThe trade of companies in the cemetery business was generally quite stable year-on-year, \nonce their trade had been properly established, although epidemics, economic recessions, \nsevere winters and even fashion (the demand for catacomb burial surged in May 1843 after \nthe first Royal burial in one of the commercial cemeteries) could influence the level of \ncompany incomes. Some growth of business could be achieved, particularly if burial fees \nwere held down although there was a tendency for expenses, in which labour costs were the \nmajor element, to rise over time, particularly in response to higher volumes of business.  \nDirectors\u2019 fees at the cemetery companies were, however, usually payable only once \ndividends had reached 5 per cent per annum.49\n \n \nEarly experiences were generally encouraging. At Kensal Green a small dividend of 3 per \ncent was paid in June 1835, at which time the company\u2019s share price stood 12 per cent above \npar and by 1839, after its \u2018period of probation of seven years\u2019, it had arrived at \u2018that degree of \nprosperity which was held out at the commencement of operations\u2019.  This was reflected in a \nmarket price for their \u20a425 shares of \u20a452, a level that was maintained into the early 1850s. The \nLondon Cemetery Company, with its cemeteries at Highgate and Nunhead, also \u2018appeared to \ndo well\u2019 for the first twenty years of its existence.  At Abney Park, the company \u2018prospered \nfrom the start\u2019, with 5000 burials in its first decade and more than two thousand a year during \nthe early 1850s, while even at Tower Hamlets, the least fashionable of the new cemeteries, the \ncompany was able to quickly build up its volume of business, particularly through common \ninterments and Church of England burials.50\n \n \nTable 1 shows the share capital, total capital, number of interments, revenues, expenses, \nprofits and two rates of return for each of the companies concerned across the period 1833-52, \nas far as the available data permits. Rates of return have been defined as the rate of the profits \nto total shareholder capital invested in that business and\/or as the rate of dividends to share \ncapital (a close proxy thereto during the nineteenth century, when profit retentions were \ntypically small). It took some while for the South Metropolitan Company to build up its trade \nat Norwood Cemetery and, over the period 1837 to 1852, earned on average only 1.8 per cent \na year, although there are clear signs of the company\u2019s improved profitability from the late \n1840s.51  There are considerable gaps in the data for Abney Park, but in the period 1850-52, \n                                                                                                                                           21 \ntheir dividends averaged 4.7 per cent (and would rise by the end of the 1850s to 9 per cent a \nyear). The General Cemetery Company was the most profitable of the four companies; it \nquickly established a commercial level of business and by 1845 was generally able to pay an \nannual dividend of 8 per cent, well above the rates that the railways were generally able to \npay their investors.52\n \n  \nThe government\u2019s initial response to the report of its Select Committee (the Chadwick \nReport) and other forms of lobbying, was to give General Boards of Health the power under \nthe Metropolitan Interments Act of 1850 to purchase the existing commercial cemeteries. \nThey duly selected the West of London and Westminster Cemetery Company, which owned \nBrompton cemetery, for their first compulsory purchase. This was a curious choice, despite \nthe prosperity of the part of London in which the cemetery stood, as the company had \nexperienced financial problems that had certainly not been hidden by its directors.  Its \noperational costs were quite high, partly because of the steep rate of compensation the \ncompany was obliged to pay local clergy, which \u2018pushed up running costs, with Brompton \nhaving to pay 10s per burial compared to only 5s paid by Kensal Green\u2019, although far more \nimportant was the level of capital expenditure, relative to the revenue stream that it could \ngenerate.53\n \n \nDespite the involvement of experienced promoters, by 1841 the directors had accepted that \nthe original capital of \u00a350,000 was \u2018wholly insufficient to meet the expenditure required for \ncompleting the cemetery buildings\u2019. The projected capital costs had been \u00a331,000 but, even \nafter the issue of 3000 \u00a325 shares (on which it had received \u00a363,500) and the raising of loan \nfinance of \u00a316,000, the original design was still incomplete; if the Anglican chapel was \nundeniably splendid, the lack of funds prevented the construction of non-conformist and \nRoman Catholic chapels to provide for their other prospective customers. The government \nthen tried to withdraw their offer, but the shareholders, who had received virtually no \ndividends since the formation of the company in 1840, prevented this. The government\u2019s offer \nof \u00a344,000 was well below the (exaggerated) amount that the company claimed to have spent \non capital items (\u00a3148,000) but a more realistic figure of \u00a374,900 was agreed upon after \narbitration.54\n \n  \nThe available data on Brompton (see Table 1) is sketchy but is still sufficient to indicate the \nvery real difficulties that the company faced. By 1849-51, the number of interments was twice \nthat of the loss-making years of 1843-44 and revenues had increased similarly, but the \ncompany was still only generating receipts of 5.8 per cent on the capital invested; after \ndeduction of necessary operating costs and the interest needed to service their loans, they \n                                                                                                                                           22 \nwere not going to be able to earn much more than 1.5 per cent a year on the capital they had \nspent, a third of the rate of return expected at that time for relatively low-risk commercial \ninvestments. The government compounded its error by making no attempt to buy any of the \nother cemetery companies, although the available evidence suggests that the West of London \nand Westminster Company, which owned Brompton Cemetery, was probably the least \nprofitable of the companies, at least in the period before it was taken over by the government.   \n \nV   \n \n \nEven after the private cemeteries had been built, the progress of reform was slow and protests \ncontinued to be made concerning burial conditions in the capital.  The most eloquent voice \nbelonged to the surgeon George Walker, whose early studies in Paris had first acquainted him \nwith the French system. In 1839 he published Gatherings from Graveyards, a lurid and \nshocking account of his explorations of inner city burial grounds.  He described the soil of the \nGreen Ground as saturated with human putrescence, with human bones scattered on the \nsurface (consequent upon the practice of re-using the coffin wood and metal fixings) and \nwrote of his visit to a Southwark graveyard, where \u2018a body partly decomposed was dug up \nand placed on the surface, at the side slightly covered with earth; a mourner stepped upon it, \nand the loosened skin peeled off, he slipped forward and had nearly fallen into the grave\u2019.55\n \n  \nWalker\u2019s efforts were continually opposed by medical authorities with their own theories of \ndisease to promote, by the vested interest of the Anglican Church (burial fees in London \nprovided between a third and a half of clergy incomes) and even some non-conformist clergy \nfearful of the effect on their finances, but in 1842 a Commons Select Committee of \nInvestigation upheld Walker\u2019s central argument, that interment in towns was detrimental to \nthe health of the living.  \n \nThe Benthamite reformer, Edwin Chadwick, was deeply involved with issues of public health. \nAppalled at the unsanitary and over-crowded burial-grounds of London, he opposed burials in \ntowns and cities and advocated government intervention and the national provision of public \ncemeteries to provide burial facilities, particularly for those of more limited means. He \nstrongly disapproved of the joint-stock company cemeteries as \u2018trading associations\u2019 that \nwere bound to reject any improvements that did not promise an \u2018immediate return for the \nexpense incurred\u2019. In the early 1840s, Chadwick was appointed by the government to chair \nthe Select Committee that published highly influential reports on the Improvement of the \nHealth of Towns in 1842 and on the Results of a Special Inquiry into the Practice of Interment \n                                                                                                                                           23 \nin Towns in 1843, providing evidence of the effects of poor drainage, sewerage arrangements \nand insanitary water provision on the conditions and health of poorer people in London and \ndemonstrating the relationship between life expectancy and wealth and social class.56\n \n  \nThe reports increased the opposition to burial in catacombs or vaults, although it seems to \nhave been the recurrence of cholera in 1848 and its effects on the numbers of interments in \nLondon cemeteries that finally led to the closure of the Green Ground and other graveyards \nand to the first Public Health Act (1848).  The Metropolitan Interments Act of 1850 forbade \nfurther burials in crowded churchyards but, by providing compensation to the Anglican clergy \nfor the loss of burial fees and thus stifling their opposition, removed the greatest stumbling \nblock to reform. The Act also gave General Boards of Health the power to provide burial \ngrounds and purchase the established commercial cemeteries (see above), while the Burial of \nthe Dead in the Metropolis Act of 1852 allowed the setting up of cemeteries (such as \nCamberwell Old Cemetery at Honor Oak) by Burial Boards. Although it did not prohibit the \nformation of further private cemetery companies, it did prompt the increased provision in the \npublic sector that would quickly limit further growth in the private sector. 57\n \n  \nVI   \n \nIn the middle of the nineteenth century, the dominance of the established Church over English \nburials was challenged when the state looked initially to private enterprise and then to the \nmunicipalities as the appropriate mechanism to take over this responsibility. In the early years \nof the twentieth century, cremation, once shunned, began to provide a more fundamental \nsolution to the needs of mourners in crowded urban areas where differing interests competed \nfor scarce land resources.58\n \n \nSince then, burial provision has been far less controversial although a number of inherent \ntensions have surfaced from time to time. The cost of graveyard maintenance, in the absence \nof recurrent payments by the bereaved, brought predictable problems and most of the private \nsector London cemeteries were, in the twentieth century, unable to meet their formal \nresponsibility to keep cemetery, chapels and walls in \u2018thorough and complete repair\u2019, leading \nto accelerated physical deterioration, vandalism and the eventual purchase of the sites in the \npublic interest by local authorities for modest or nominal sums, typically in the 1970s.59  In \nOctober 2004, a naval war veteran and his wife went to court to determine whether they had a \nright to burial in the local churchyard or whether the parochial church council was entitled to \ndeclare it full; under existing law, churchyards can be formally closed only by an Order of the \nPrivy Council, signed by the Queen, on the ground that there is no longer space for burials \n                                                                                                                                           24 \nand, once closed, churchyards cannot be re-opened.60  Even the activities of the early \nnineteenth century \u2018resurrection men\u2019, that so threatened the piece of mind of the bereaved, \nhave recently returned to New York and sent \u2018shockwaves across America\u2019; this time, organs \nand bones had been removed from perhaps a thousand corpses to meet the high demand for \ndonated tissue in the medical transplant markets.61\n \n  \nAlthough some problems persist, considerable progress was made, particularly during the \nnineteenth century.  In London, the official statistics of the time suggest that the rate of death, \nfrom a population of 1,870,700, approached 45,000 a year. Overcrowding in the small \nchurchyards had produced conditions that posed a clear \u2018threat to both health and adjacent \nproperty\u2019, while the larger burial-grounds at Bethnal Green and Bunhill Fields had already \nabsorbed nearly 150,000 bodies into their 6.5 acres, so there was clearly the most urgent need \nfor additional resources to be made available.62\n \n \nThe willingness of private entrepreneurs to ease the overcrowding problems by opening large, \nnew cemeteries on the city margins, without need for the state to raise taxes at a time when it \nwas facing major constitutional problems, must have seemed welcome indeed.63\n   \n  At this time, \nthe sanctioning of limited liability companies by Act of Parliament had already proved \nsatisfactory as a mechanism by which to develop the canals and had recently been used for the \nnew \u2018network industries\u2019, gas lighting and water supply, and its extension to a different type \nof urban problem, burial provision, must have seemed logical, if risky given the religious and \npersonal sensibilities involved.  \nThe new companies certainly offered a significant amount of additional space for burials; the \nfirst to open was twenty times larger than any other burial ground in London and collectively, \nthe private sector made available nearly 300 acres on the edges of the city. In the early 1840s,  \neven before some of the new cemeteries were fully operational, the private sector was \nproviding 3,335 burials a year, 7 per cent of the total, and by 1854 they were meeting about a \nquarter of London\u2019s needs (with plenty of spare capacity in hand), thereby allowing the \ngovernment to close down the most crowded parochial burial-grounds.64\n \n   \nThe persistence of appalling conditions in the city churchyards and chapels into the 1840s was \na cause of great social concern. The private companies were also criticised, in spite of their \nefforts, on the grounds that burial provision was an \u2018unfit subject for trading profit\u2019, that the \ncost of their funerals was \u2018iniquitous\u2019 and, by implication, that their profit levels were too \nhigh. The last two perspectives did not, however, entirely match up. A substantial proportion \nof the total cost of a funeral consisted of the payments made to stone-masons and undertakers; \n                                                                                                                                           25 \nby the 1840s, the latter were charging \u20a450-70 for an \u2018ordinary\u2019 middle-class funeral, although \nthe growing public taste for such items as black ostrich feathers and white silk winding-sheets \nand gloves could quickly raise this to \u20a4120-30.65\n \n  \nThe somewhat sentimental assumption that the commercial provision of activities that are \nmorally objectionable, at least to some people, is necessarily highly lucrative has not been \nconfined to Victorian observers; even in the 1990s, Rugg was able to conclude that \u2018immense \nprofits \u2026 were to be had from burials\u2019 whereas, as this paper has shown, the reality was \nrather that the private companies offered an expensive and not particularly profitable service  \n(consequent on an average cost per cemetery of around \u00a365,000) that was effectively confined \nto middle-class sensibilities and pockets.66\n \n  \nFurthermore, soon after the private cemetery companies were established, the deficiencies  \nof competitive mechanisms in the urban water and gas industries began to emerge and the \nattitude of Parliament towards private enterprise changed quite quickly. The municipalities \ngrew in stature at this time, partly because as they took over gas and water provision, they \nproved far more responsive to local needs and generally set much lower prices than the \ncommercial companies. When the local authority took responsibility for burial provision in \nLondon, they were able to establish cemeteries for \u2018around \u00a320,000\u2019, less than a third of the \naverage cost in the private sector and this helped them to provide decent burials at a cost with \nwhich the poor could cope and of a simplicity that suited the tastes of Dissenters.67  The \ndecision to transfer responsibility for urban burials away from the private companies to the \nmunicipalities was thus in large part a political decision, a recognition that \u2018cemeteries could \nnot be regarded for long as oases of peace for the dead of the privileged classes\u2019 and that the \nworking classes needed to be able to bury their dead at prices they could afford.68\n \n  \nThe initial support of government for the privatisation of London cemeteries and its \nsubsequent conversion to the merits of municipalisation are fully consistent with changes in \nthe government thinking of that time concerning the major new urban utilities, gas lighting \nand water supply. The argument in this paper is that the defining characteristics that Foreman-\nPeck and Millward attribute to \u2018network technology industries\u2019 of the time (high fixed costs, \nconsequently lower unit costs the higher the volume of output and the absence of an effective \nsecond-hand market for asset sales such that investments were effectively \u2018sunk costs\u2019) were \nalso present in other trades and indeed provide an appropriate framework for understanding \nthe changing patterns of responsibility for cemetery provision in the Metropolis in the first \nhalf of the nineteenth century, despite the very different problems and sensibilities that burial \ninvolves. \n                                                                                                                                           26 \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors would like to thank David Burkett, Company Secretary to the General Cemetery Company, \nJon Newman and Graham Gower of Lambeth Archives for their help in accessing archival materials \nused in this paper and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments on an earlier version of the \npaper. \n \nReferences \nArchival: \nGeneral Cemetery Company: annual reports 1834-90, General Cemetery Company offices. \n \nWest of London and Westminster Cemetery Company: minute books, 1839-54 WORK 6\/65-67; Public \nRecords Office, Kew  \n \nSouth Metropolitan Cemetery Company: ledger 1837-1873 IV\/100\/AD\/3\/1; \nminutes of general meetings and annual accounts 1864-1915 IV\/100\/AD3\/1-2;  Lambeth archives \n \nAbney Park Cemetery Company: annual accounts 1882-95 D\/B\/ABN\/1\/26; \nminute books of directors 1850-79 D\/B\/ABN\/1\/1-2; Report on Burial Acts 1852-90 ABN\/1\/56; \nHackney archives.

The legal position governing burials in municipal cemeteries was \nclarified by the Local Authority Cemetery Order (1977), which restricted the right of burial in \nperpetuity, so that areas containing older graves could be reused for new burials.  \n61 Observer Magazine, 2 April 2006, 20-27.  \n62 Official returns made to the House of Commons in 1833 identified a figure of 32,412 interments in \nthe burying places of the established churches in London (including Chelsea, Kensington, Saint Mary-\nle-Bone, Paddington and St. Pancras in the county of Middlesex), to which must be added about 10,500 \nfor the burial-grounds of Dissenters and Jews and general burial-grounds.
