Meredith (2006), Comment on \u2018\u2018On the origin of whistler mode radiation in the\nplasmasphere\u2019\u2019 by Green et al., J. Geophys. Res., 111, A09210, doi:10.1029\/2005JA011477.\n[1] Green et al. [2005] have recently performed a statis-\ntical analysis of the global distribution of whistler-mode\nradiation in the plasmasphere. They use the results to draw\ninferences on the origin of different emissions and the\npotential impact of such waves on scattering loss of reso-\nnant electrons from the radiation belts. Specifically, they\npresent evidence that the average intensity of waves at\nfrequencies near 3.0 kHz exhibits a spatial distribution in\nboth MLT and geographical longitude similar to the distri-\nbution of lightning. Green et al. [2005] claim that the\nproperties of such waves are representative of plasma-\nspheric hiss, an important magnetospheric emission, which\nhas previously been shown to be a major scattering agent in\nthe slot region between the inner and outer radiation belts\n[Lyons and Thorne, 1973; Abel and Thorne, 1998]. We\ndisagree with both the interpretation made by Green et al.\n[2005] of the nature of the reported waves and their\nconclusion that lightning is ultimately responsible for radi-\nation belt loss in the slot region between the inner and outer\nbelts. Because their work has been made public via a NASA\npress release and reported in popular science news articles,\nwe feel it is important to voice our strong disagreement with\ntheir conclusions, which give an erroneous impression\nabout the role of lightning in the loss of radiation belt\nelectrons.\n[2] Plasmaspheric hiss is a broadband whistler-mode\nemission, primarily confined within the high-density plas-\nmasphere, with peak power spectral intensity near a few\nhundred Hz [Thorne et al.,1973]. The intensity of plasma-\nspheric hiss falls rapidly above 1 kHz, and the waves are\nrarely seen above 3 kHz. Plasmaspheric hiss is easily\nidentified on high time resolution spectrograms and clearly\ndistinguishable from more discrete signals originating from\nlightning, which can occur over a similar frequency range,\nbut which generally extend to higher frequency. Lightning-\nassociated emissions that enter the magnetosphere are\nstrongest near a few kHz [Edgar, 1976] and become very\nweak below 1 kHz, where plasmaspheric hiss emissions\nhave their peak spectral intensity. A second distinguishing\ncharacteristic is the pronounced dependence of the intensity\nof plasmaspheric hiss on both the flux of resonant electrons\n[Cornilleau-Wehrlin et al., 1985], and on the level of\ngeomagnetic activity [Smith et al., 1974; Thorne et al.,\n1976; Meredith et al., 2004]. Discrete whistlers originating\nfrom lightning, and magnetospherically reflected whistlers\nthat merge into a broadband distribution following many\ninternal reflections [Bortnik et al., 2003], show little depen-\ndence on geomagnetic activity and their power spectral\nintensity is usually much weaker than hiss [e.g., Ristic-\nDjurovic et al., 1998].\n[3] Careful examination of the average latitudinal distri-\nbution of dayside 1.2 kHz waves in Figure 2 of Green et al.\n[2005] reveals two distinct populations; one peaked at high\nlatitude (which may best be interpreted as lightning-gener-\nated emissions propagating away from the atmosphere) and\na second population distributed around the equator, which is\nremarkably similar to the modeled distribution of obliquely\npropagating magnetospherically reflected (MR) whistlers\n[Thorne and Horne, 1994], which also originate from\nlightning and tend to settle, after several magnetospheric\nreflections, around a field line where the wave frequency is\ncomparable to the equatorial lower hybrid frequency\n[Bortnik et al., 2003]. As a consequence, MR whistlers\noccur in a band, which moves to higher frequency at lower\nL [Bortnik et al., 2003], while plasmaspheric hiss tends to\noccur in a broad band which is relatively independent of L.\nGreen et al. [2005] identify both reported populations of\n1.2 kHz waves as plasmaspheric hiss, but we assert that they\nare simply the direct result of lightning emissions. Although\nthe waves have an MLT morphology similar to the distri-\nbution of plasmaspheric hiss [Meredith et al., 2004], the\naverage power spectral intensity reported by Green et al.\n[2005] is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the\nintensity of lower-frequency plasmaspheric hiss, under\nmoderately active geomagnetic conditions, reported by\nMeredith et al. [2004]. Because the rate of electron pitch-\nangle scattering is proportional to the power of resonant\nwaves [Lyons et al., 1972], the waves reported by Green et\nal. [2005] are relatively insignificant in causing electron\nloss from the outer plasmasphere, where scattering by the\nmore intense lower frequency (300\u2013700 Hz) plasmaspheric\nhiss is dominant [Abel and Thorne, 1998]. Nevertheless,\nthese weaker lightning-generated emissions could still con-\ntribute to electron loss in the inner portion of the plasma-\nsphere, where hiss becomes weaker [Thorne et al., 1973],\nand where resonance with energetic electrons becomes less\neffective [Abel and Thorne, 1998].\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 111, A09210, doi:10.1029\/2005JA011477, 2006\n1Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles, USA.\n2British Antarctic Survey, Natural Environment Research Council,\nCambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/06\/2005JA011477$09.00\nA09210 1 of 2\n[4] Despite considerable theoretical analysis and model-\ning [Etcheto et al., 1973; Parady, 1974; Thorne et al., 1979;\nChurch and Thorne, 1983; Huang et al., 1983], the origin of\nplasmaspheric hiss remains controversial and to this date\nunresolved. Green et al. [2005] claim that their observations\nstrongly support lightning as the dominant source for\nplasmaspheric hiss, a concept introduced earlier by\nSonwalker and Inan [1989] and Draganov et al. [1992].\nTo further support this assertion, Green et al. [2005] show\nevidence in Figures 7 and 8 for an enhancement of the high-\nlatitude 3 kHz emissions over geographic longitudes aligned\nwith the continents, where thunderstorm activity is higher,\nbut they omit from their analysis waves measured near the\nequator; a key population for plasmaspheric hiss. We agree\nthat the 3kHz waves reported by Green et al. [2005] are\nprobably dominated by lightning emissions that propagate\ndirectly out from the atmosphere over areas of thunderstorm\nactivity. However, we strongly disagree that lightning is\nresponsible for the most intense hiss band below 1 kHz.\n[5] As noted above, plasmaspheric hiss has peak power\nspectral intensity at much lower frequency (<1 kHz),\nexhibits a pronounced dependence on geomagnetic activity\n[Meredith et al., 2004], and has typical intensity several\norders of magnitude larger than the peak power spectral\nintensities of 3 kHz waves (\u00013 \u0002 10\u00037 g2\/Hz) reported by\nGreen et al. [2005]. To demonstrate whether lightning is\nresponsible for the origin of plasmaspheric hiss, and by\nassociation the ultimate cause of electron loss in the slot\nregion of the radiation belts, a similar analysis would have\nto be performed on the most intense hiss emissions near\n500 Hz. In their discussion section, Green et al. [2005]\nadmit that \u2018\u2018the strong geographical mapping\u2019\u2019 (and hence a\ncorrelation to lightning) \u2018\u2018only becomes obvious above\u2019\u2019 the\n\u0004500 Hz range. We contend that this key distinction,\ntogether with the pronounced association of (\u00051 kHz) hiss\nintensities with geomagnetic activity [Meredith et al., 2004],\npoints to a natural instability in the magnetosphere for the\norigin of hiss. The nature of this source still needs to be\nestablished, but lightning does not appear to play a signif-\nicant role, either directly or as an embrionic source.\n[6] The assertion by Green et al. [2005] that lightning\n\u2018\u2018maintains the slot region in the radiation belt\u2019\u2019 is not only\nincorrect but it also ignores the considerable theoretical work\nthat has shown that the slot region between the inner and outer\nradiation belts is a result of a balance between inward radial\ndiffusion and losses from several different plasma waves\n[Lyons and Thorne, 1973; Abel and Thorne, 1998]. The slot\nis most pronounced at energies above an MeV. At such high-\nenergies, electron scattering by low-frequency (\u0001Hz) elec-\ntromagnetic ion cyclotron waves, which have no possible\nconnection to lightning, is a dominant loss process [Albert,\n2003; Summers and Thorne, 2003].\n[7] Acknowledgments.
