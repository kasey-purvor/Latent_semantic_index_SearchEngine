Building on a piece of social research addressing public responses \nto the social and ethical dimensions of emerging nanotechnologies, the paper develops a \nmethodology and mode of analysis designed to take into account four distinctive features of \nnanotechnology discourse and its constitution in the public sphere, namely: its unfamiliarity; \nits promissory quality; its uncanniness; and its metaphysical assumptions of progress. \nThrough an analysis of common narratives that shape and structure lay public responses to \nthe technology, and in response to framings of how the technology and its applications are \nbeing crafted in the public domain, the paper argues that nanotechnologies offer a site for \nan intense future politics centred on dilemmas of body invasion, unanticipated risks, \nnature\u2019s revenge, control, inequalities and pace of change. The paper concludes with a set of \nreflections on the role of the critical social sciences in such a future techno-politics. \nKey words:  nanotechnology, technoscientific governance, emergent public attitudes, \nnarrative, metaphysics \nIntroduction \nIn response to widespread public reaction to technological risk issues over the last two \ndecades, we have witnessed a move internationally, and especially in Europe, towards state \nfunded initiatives aimed at encouraging wider public engagement and societal participation \nin technoscientific processes as a means of improving relations between science and society. \nSuch initiatives are developed for multiple and overlapping reasons, both instrumental and \nnormative, and include the belief that they will, inter alia, help restore public trust in \nscience, avoid future controversy, lead to socially robust innovation policy, democratise \nscientific governance, and render scientific culture and praxis more socially accountable and \nreflexive (Kearnes and Macnaghten, 2006; European Commission, 2007). While one can \nquestion the cumulative effect of such initiatives and whether they amount to, in effect, the \nnew social contract between science and society that has been suggested in official \ndocuments (House of Lords, 2000; European Commission, 2000), one can nevertheless \nwitness a new and significant role being crafted for the social sciences (Irwin, 2006; \nHagendijk, 2004).  \nThese developments are arguably most advanced in policy and governance debates on \nnanotechnology, both in the United States and in Europe, and for good reasons. Here is a \ntechnology with substantial and strategic levels of investment and expectation seen as in \ndanger of running up against comparable adverse public reaction to that experienced with \ngenetically modified foods and crops. Here, using the language of \u2018responsible innovation\u2019, \nsocial scientists are being asked not simply to characterise broader societal concerns in a \nMacnaghten RESEARCHING TECHNOSCIENTIC CONCERNS IN-THE-MAKING \n \n 2\nproactive manner, but also to integrate such considerations into nanoscience and \nnanotechnology research programmes at an early stage (Barben et al, 2007; European \nCommission, 2004; NSTC, 2004; Royal Society\/ Royal Academy of Engineering, 2004). Alfred \nNordmann has playfully characterised the role of science and technology studies (STS) within \nthese debates, from the \u2018science wars\u2019 of the 1980s and 1990s to the \u2018love fest\u2019 of \ncontemporary times (Nordmann 2007).  \nAt the core of this paper is an attempt to engage critically and empirically with one \nhitherto under-researched element of this role: that of the need for innovation in \nmethodology and analysis in the reflexive examination of technoscientific concerns \u2013 and \ncitizens \u2013 in-the-making. Just as Rose and Novas has argued that the biosciences are \nreshaping the contours of contemporary subjectivity and citizenship through new \nunderstandings of minds, bodies and responsibilities (Rose, 2007; Novas and Rose 2000), so \ntoo can this dynamic be seen to be taking effect through nanoscience discourse and \npractice. However, my argument is more experimental and speculative. Given that the \ntechnology exists largely in terms of future oriented promise rather than as material reality, \nthe methodological requirement for the research outlined in this paper was to produce a \nspace in which lay technoscientific citizens could be produced through an innovative public \nengagement exercise, able to offer opinions, discuss the issues and reflect on future politics \nand their contingencies (Michael, 2006). The research outlined below was part of a wider \nproject, conducted in partnership with the UK public policy think-tank Demos, designed to \nexplore the role of the social sciences in contributing towards a more anticipatory and \nsocially robust governance framework (Kearnes et al, 2006). There are four sections to this \npaper. First, the methodological challenges in fostering a public dialogue on the social and \nethical dimensions of emerging nanotechnologies are summarised. Secondly, a methodology \nis outlined designed to respond to such challenges. Thirdly, the results from the public \ndialogue event are reported, focusing in particular on the narrative process that shaped and \nstructured public responses to the technology. And fourthly, reflections are offered on the \nimplications of the research for the institutional governance of emerging technologies and \non the role for the social sciences. \nSo what are the challenges in negotiating a public conversation on the social and ethical \ndimensions of emerging nanotechnologies? Firstly, it is clear from the literature that most \npeople are unfamiliar with the term and have little to no factual knowledge of what it is or of \nwhat it could be, a finding shared in survey research conducted in the United States \n(Macoubrie, 2006; Sheetz et al, 2005; Waldron, Spencer and Batt, 2006), in the United \nKingdom (BMRB Social Research, 2004; MORI, 2005), and across Europe (Eurobarometer, \n2005). One implication that derives from this finding is that if one is to understand emergent \npublic attitudes to nanotechnologies one needs to pay particular attention to the underlying \nframeworks and dynamics that are likely to structure their development and evolution (for \nan elaboration of this approach with reference to biotechnologies, see Grove-White et al, \n2000; Macnaghten, 2004).  \nA second complication arises from the fact that most nanotechnologies remain at an \nearly or pre-market stage of development, existing largely in terms of their future-oriented \nvisions of promise and abundance. The institutionally-endorsed rhetoric of a future enabled \nby nanotechnology is beset with references to its role in enabling breakthroughs across \nmultiple sectors and applications, from electronics to materials, health care to pollution \ncontrol, and of a market that has been projected to exceed $4.0 trillion by 2015 (Lux \nResearch, 2008). The future-oriented and promissory character of nanotechnology has been \nnoted by scholars, notably in relation to the speculative claims of its future potential \nMacnaghten RESEARCHING TECHNOSCIENTIC CONCERNS IN-THE-MAKING \n \n 3\n(Nordmann, 2007b), the ways in which expectations of a \u2018fantastic future\u2019 is driving current \nscientific practice (Selin, 2007), and the role of science fiction in shaping the moral \nimagination of nanoscientists (Berne, 2006) and the development of nanotechnology policy \n(Milburn 2004).  \nThe third complication arises from the so-called \u2018uncanniness\u2019 of the technology \n(Nordmann, 2005). Not only is it a technology that operates at the unbelievably small: \nnanotechnology is commonly defined as the understanding and control of matter at \ndimensions of roughly 1 to 100 nanometers, where comparative size of a nanometre to a \nmetre is the same as that of a marble to the size of the earth; but it is also at a size where \nnovel or unusual or surprising properties take effect. Nordmann (2005) has reflected on the \nincredible tininess of nanotechnology by speaking of it as a \u2018noumenal\u2019 technology, utterly \nbeyond human action, perception and causal control.  \nThe final complication arises from considerations of metaphysics. Following Popper\u2019s \nobservation that all science rests on a \u2018metaphysical research program\u2019, a set of \npresuppositions about the structure of the world which are neither testable nor \u2018falsifiable\u2019 \nempirically, but which nonetheless play an essential role in the progress of science, analysts \nhave begun to examine the metaphysical assumptions, tacit or otherwise, that tend to \nunderpin national and international programmes of nanotechnology and related initiatives \n(see Dupuy, 2005). Kearnes at al, (2006) have analysed a set of \u2018programmatic imaginaries\u2019 \nthat operate as meta-level discourses and that drive the development of the technology, \nincluding the foundational conviction that nanotechnology represents a new paradigm of \nscientific endeavour based on its ability to control and manipulate matter at atomic and \nmolecular scales. While such metaphysical assumptions are unevenly distributed within and \nacross nanotechnology\u2019s constituent scientific disciplines (Bensaude-Vincent 2004), and \nwhile there may be cultural differences between European and US versions of \nnanotechnology policy (Nordmann 2007a), there nevertheless can be seen to exist a strong \nand unified global programme of nanotechnology that is imbued with its own distinctive \nmetaphysics. Central to its metaphysical programme are visions of control and precision \n(Kearnes, 2007), of abundance and escape from scarcity (Schwartz, 2004), of emulation \nand\/or improvement of nature (Nordmann, 2005), and of a \u2018dream of reason\u2019 that is to \novercome once and for all every given that is a part of the human condition (Dupuy, 2007).  \nMethodology: eliciting technoscientific concerns in-the-making \nA methodology was developed aimed at responding to the challenges outlined above and \nthus at helping towards a contextual understanding of the factors likely to shape future \npublic responses to nanotechnologies.  A focus group methodology was chosen, designed to \nencourage discussion of potential issues arising for nanotechnology in an active learning \nsetting, where the analytical task was one of examining the narrative forms and processes \nthrough which the unfamiliar was rendered familiar. Narrative was a key category of analysis \n(for accounts on the performative role of narrative in producing knowledge, see White, \n1987; Taylor, 1992). What kind of stories would people tell about nanotechnology? To what \nextent would they be informed by direct experience with the world, or from mediated \nexperience, from books, fables, movies, television, the internet, videogames, and so on? \nHow would these narratives be drawn upon, argued over, and negotiated in the craft of \nproducing opinions and attitudes? And in what ways would publics respond when \nconfronted with narratives reflecting dominant institutional norms and aspirations? \nMacnaghten RESEARCHING TECHNOSCIENTIC CONCERNS IN-THE-MAKING \n \n 4\nThis paper thus can be seen as benefitting from insights drawn from the sociology of \nexpectations and from a body of scholarship that has examined how the future, as an \nanalytical object, has been mobilised through discourse, motif and representation (Adam \nand Groves, 2007; Brown, 2005; Brown and Michael, 2003; Brown et al, 2000). The focus on \nlay public narratives structures offers a distinctive contribution to this literature and \ncomplements existing analyses of how new science is discursively narrated through expert \nmedia (e.g. for an analysis of role of the breakthrough motif in reporting new science, see \nBrown 2000). \nGiven the promissory character of most nanotechnologies, considerable thought was \ngiven to the institutional forms and narratives through which the technology is being \nintroduced in the public domain (e.g. in the form of policy reports, newspaper articles, \ntelevision documentaries, industry presentations, campaign materials, and so on). Two \ndominant frames were identified: one that interpolated nanotechnology as a new science \nthat would contribute to projected breakthroughs across multiple sectors and spheres of \napplication (European Commission, 2004; House of Commons Science and Technology \nCommittee 2004); the other more avowedly utopian and revolutionary, with promises of \nhow nanotechnology will extend and transform human sensory and physical capacities to \ntranscend natural and physical constraint (Roco and Bainbridge, 2003). In addition, a third \nframe was added, derived from civil society actors and sceptics that focused on the potential \nand uncertain risks of the technology on human health and the environment, and of wider \nconcerns of the technology running \u2018out of control\u2019 (ETC, 2003; Joy, 2000; Lloyds, 2007). \nThese three visions were encapsulated in stimulus materials as reflective of three dominant \nframes \u2013 or styles of thought (Fleck, 1979; Hacking, 1992; Rose, 2007) \u2013 involving not simply \nwhat nanotechnology is, but what it explains, and what it represents. By exposing \nparticipants to the multiple frames characteristic of the emerging public debate, and by \nencouraging discussion and exchange on the credibility, legitimacy and authority of such \nframes, the design was intended explicitly to simulate the real-world dynamics through \nwhich nanotechnologies and their associated social relationships become co-produced. \nThe methodology further aimed to explore the \u2018uncanniness\u2019 of the nano world, and how \nit differed from the world of everyday experience. The participants were encouraged to \ndevelop a \u2018nano imagination\u2019 through design choices that included: extended time (the focus \ngroups took place over two consecutive sessions, each session lasting two hours), a \ndedicated task between the sessions (people were asked to research for themselves the \nissue of nanotechnology, and to explore the topic with friends and colleagues, consulting \nwebsites, and keeping a journal for any reflections arising), an \u2018in action\u2019 focus (in which \nparticipants were encouraged to understand the arguments and debates surrounding \nnanotechnology as it was being practiced by actors in real-world circumstances), and a \nsample aimed at group enculturation (the groups, all non-expert in the field of \nnanotechnology, were chosen on the basis of common work or life histories \u2013 see also \nsection below). To engage with the metaphysical dimensions of nanotechnology, the \nresearch was moderated in such a manner as to encourage discussion not simply on the \ntechnology as technique, but also on the underlying visions and motivations that appear to \nbe driving the technology.  \nThe sample consisted of five groups, recruited by professional recruiters on the basis of \ntheir existing participation in local community or political issues, but with no prior \ninvolvement or exposure to nanotechnology. They included a group of professional men \n(doctors, architects, civil servants etc.) \u2013 Group 1; a group of professional women (mostly \nemployed as middle managers in business) \u2013 Group 2; a mixed gender group with \nMacnaghten RESEARCHING TECHNOSCIENTIC CONCERNS IN-THE-MAKING \n \n 5\ndemonstrable political interests \u2013 Group 3; a group of women with children at school age \u2013 \nGroup 4; and a mixed gender group all of whom expressed an interest in technology \u2013 Group \n5. The groups were conducted in Manchester and London in the late summer of 2005. The \ngroups were not recruited to be representative of British society in a formal sense. Rather, \nthe groups were chosen for two intersecting reasons: to have shared life histories or work \nexperience on issues that were seen as potentially relevant to the framing of response to \nnanotechnology (e.g. sharing interests in technology or politics; sharing know-how of raising \nchildren; sharing experience of business management or the professions); and to have \nrelevant intellectual or social capital to develop collective imaginations of the nano world \n(e.g. the participants tended to take an interest in topical affairs, to have participated in \nhigher education, and to be involved in local community matters). The fact that these groups \nwere selected on these criteria did little to mitigate against the generalisability of the \nfindings given the diversity across key factors (age, gender, location), and our interest in \nunderstanding the narrative dynamics through which \u2018uninformed\u2019 publics develop \nresponses to nanotechnology. \nConceptualising public concerns to nanotechnology \nUnsurprisingly, when participants were requested to offer an opinion on the term \nnanotechnology, there was little familiarity or knowledge, a finding that parallels attitudinal \nsurvey research as noted above. When pressed, participants tended to characterise \nnanotechnology as scientific, clever, small, possibly medical, strange, futuristic, and \nsomething associated with science fiction. Even for the more technologically literate \nparticipants who had heard of nanotechnology and of its \u2018uncanny\u2019 potential (Nordmann, \n2005), it nevertheless was perceived as foreign, strange and other-worldly: \nAlistair: \u201cIt\u2019s almost the best of all the terms for being one where I know the idea that \nnanotechnology is really small technology and occasionally I\u2019ll read something in The \nGuardian or wherever about \u2013 \u2018it\u2019s amazing, these guys have written their names in \natoms on something\u2019 and you\u2019re like, wow, that\u2019s cool. And you have this very \nnebulous notion that this is really clever and that there are \u2026 all these possibilities \nthat are, you know, waiting to be unlocked in nanotechnology. But I actually have no \nidea you know what they\u2019re really doing and or what these possibilities are. I just have \nthis very vague notion that it\u2019s very clever and it could be really important. And that\u2019s \nkind of the epitome of what we were talking about before, about not really knowing \nthe detail.\u201d \n(Group 3)  \nThis background and vaguely affirmative sensibility can help to explain the relatively positive \nperceptions of nanotechnology found in attitudinal surveys, where people may be \nresponding broadly to the connotations of the term \u2018technology\u2019 without much \nunderstanding of the detail (Gaskell et al, 2005). This research sought to deepen this analysis \nthrough examining the narrative structures through which people came to develop collective \nand shared accounts of what was \u2018at stake\u2019 in the technology. Typically, the evolution of \nexpressed attitudes followed a pattern roughly as follows: from a state of initial ignorance, \nto surprise at how much research and R&D was being invested by both governments and \nindustry, to enthusiasm as to the potential for social good not least in the medical domain, \nto unease and anxiety that nanotechnology innovation might lead to largely unanticipated \nand disruptive problems in real-world circumstances, to pessimism over our ability to govern \nand regulate the technology for the common good. What led people to positions of unease \nand apprehension was not simply a consequence of realising that nanotechnology would \nMacnaghten RESEARCHING TECHNOSCIENTIC CONCERNS IN-THE-MAKING \n \n 6\nenable scientists and other actors to extend control radically over matter, nature and the \nhuman body; but that such control over the pace, scope and direction of change would be \ngoverned by powerful bodies, propelled by the logics of industrial capitalism, and where the \nlay public would be \u2018kept in the dark\u2019. These perceived \u2018real world\u2019 dynamics led to \npredictions that nanotechnologies would exacerbate global inequality and facilitate \nevermore intense subjection of individual bodies. What emerged thus was a dense array of \nconcerns; few specific or unique to nanotechnology but distinctive in their sheer breadth \nand convergence. For reasons that will be discussed later in this paper, nanotechnology \nappeared to have intensified response along familiar and consistent themes around the \nbody, unanticipated risks, nature\u2019s revenge, control, inequalities, and pace of change.  \nFor many people the anxiety potential of nanotechnology came to the fore in relation to \nthe concerns of nanoparticles potentially violating bodily processes, either through \ncosmetics or foods. Just as genetically modified foods heightened concern on account of \nbeing undetectable by texture, smell or appearance (Adam, 1998), the invisibility of \nnanoparticles and their potential ubiquity into everyday consumer goods resonated with \nbackground fears linked to an enduring narrative of \u2018bodily invasion\u2019. \nRosie: \u201cI imagine. This face cream which has got very small nanoparticles in it, I don\u2019t \nknow whether it\u2019s made of nanoparticles or whether it\u2019s just using nanotechnology. \nBut if I rub that on my skin or someone\u2019s rubbing it into their skin and therefore \nthere\u2019s things going into my skin I\u2019m not aware of. We\u2019ve already said this really but \nno-one knows exactly what that\u2019s going to do and it might have long term effects \nwhere, just imagine, free radicals which I\u2019m sure you know potentially make cells get \nconfused and breaks the genes in the cells and makes them grow out of control. Any \nlittle bit of dirt, like something that shouldn\u2019t be in there pops into the cell, messes \nwith the actual sequence of what that cell does and you know - that\u2019s so scary.\u201d \nJulie: \u201cYeah because it can happen without you realising, whereas before, things, if they \nwere going to invade your body or invade something, you would see it happening.\u201d \nPhilip: \u201cIt\u2019s the invisible threat.\u201d \nJulie: \u201cYeah, that\u2019s it.\u201d \nHelen: \u201cBecause you cannot see it\u2026\u201d \n (Group 5) \nA visceral example of this dynamic was voiced in the London group of women with young \nchildren. In the initial session these women had clearly enjoyed the proposition that \nnanotechnology might visibly and demonstrably ameliorate signs of ageing through newly \npotent anti-wrinkle creams. Now, when confronted by acknowledged uncertainties as to the \npotential toxicological effects of nanoparticles, the conversation shifted in tone: \nRochelle: \u201cSince last week I\u2019ve completely changed my approach to these creams. When \nyou said it had those \u2018nanosomes\u2019, I thought, \u2018oh great, fantastic, I\u2019d use it\u2019 \u2013 [now] I \nwouldn\u2019t touch it now with a barge pole [even] if you paid me money to put that stuff \non my face now. It\u2019s so frightening.\u201d \nVictoria: \u201cI think we\u2019re very trusting as buyers in the market, or in general, the public, \nwe\u2019re very trusting of the products we\u2019re given and, the thing is, now you find out \nafterwards \u2013 we\u2019re suddenly having to become very sceptical because things come out \nafterwards.\u201d \nRenee: \u201cWell, you sort of assume it\u2019s always been tested.\u201d \nKaren: \u201cYes.\u201d \nMacnaghten RESEARCHING TECHNOSCIENTIC CONCERNS IN-THE-MAKING \n \n 7\nRenee: \u201cWhich clearly obviously things like cosmetics don\u2019t have the controls that the \ndrugs do.\u201d \nRochelle: \u201cBut surely wouldn\u2019t they be better to sort of like say, right, we don\u2019t know \nenough, and until we know enough, or we\u2019ve changed our regulations, or whatever, \nthen we don\u2019t let it go on the market.\u201d \nVictoria: \u201cThere\u2019s too much money in it I think.\u201d \n(Group 4) \nThe potential for harm \u2013 for example in the unknown toxicity of nanoparticles \u2013 was \ncommonly seen as symptomatic of the wider phenomena of advanced technology \nproceeding in the face of natural limits and processes. GM foods, MRSA, mad cow disease \nand others, were presented as examples of technological innovation that had been \ndeveloped in the face of unanticipated risks of a complex and uncertain nature. Beck\u2019s \u2018Risk \nSociety\u2019 had become an everyday reality for our participants (Beck, 1992). Nanotechnology \nwas seen as a further and worrying extension of this dynamic, led, as it appeared to be, \nthrough a hubristic sense of its perceived ability to transform both society and nature: \nJames: \u201cThey will find new bacteria and we will be more resistant. Antibiotics and things \nare becoming resistant. There will be more diseases that will come. We will never \ncompletely get rid of disease.\u201d \n(Group 5) \nNeil: \u201cI think it\u2019s accelerating the evolution of disasters\u2026 You were going on \u2013 on the \nboard there \u2013 about accelerating the evolution of human systems, brain power and \nhealing powers and stuff. It\u2019ll get \u2018out of the cage\u2019, I\u2019m sure, and evolve through \nvarious bio-strains and mechanisms and it will be adapted, possibly. There are cases \nwith GM super weeds now.\u201d \n(Group 1) \nThe metaphysical explanation \nSo why did nanotechnology present such troubling visions. There are perhaps three \ninterlocking explanations. First, people responded to the metaphysics embedded in the \nradical and utopian vision of nanotechnology as cause for alarm. The metaphysical project, \ncommon in this particular narrative of nanotechnology, presents the technology as an \nenabler of human capacities, needs, desires and potentialities. Through nanotechnology, the \nargument runs, people will be able to transcend their material and \u2018natural\u2019 constraints and \nthus realise full liberation and emancipation. While such a narrative has been given most \nvisible expression in the National Science Foundation report on Converging Technologies \n(Roco and Bainbridge, 2002), it nevertheless represents a wider emergent style of thought \ncharacteristic of much of nanotechnology especially in the US policy context (Nordmann, \n2007c), and reflective more widely of characteristically American ideals of technology \n(Noble, 1999). Below is how one of the groups attempted to express what they found \ntroubling in this vision: \nNeil: \u201cIf you actually took that wholly on board, everything that\u2019s printed on there, it\u2019s \nquite a frightening scenario, isn\u2019t it. So this wonderful nanotechnology is going to be a \ncure all for all human ills, it\u2019s going to make us all super brilliant and clever and work \nthat much better, our transport\u2019s going to be far better even though the fact that \nnobody will be dying of old age, nobody will be dying of any illnesses so we won\u2019t be \nable to move on this planet. Yet we\u2019ll be able to move about quicker because the \nMacnaghten RESEARCHING TECHNOSCIENTIC CONCERNS IN-THE-MAKING \n \n 8\ntrains or whatever will be much more efficient. It\u2019s \u2013 a lot of what is written there is \nreally [is] in effect going against nature isn\u2019t it, it\u2019s trying to beat nature at its own \ngame and going back to what I said before about the medical side of it, it is rather \nfrightening I think. It is very welcoming if it\u2019s used to treat cancers and stuff like that \nbut I think that somewhere along the line we\u2019re getting into this Brave New World \nscenario here where everything\u2019s [pause], it\u2019s this ideal world where everyone lives \nforever and everybody has everything, everybody can do everything\u2026 It\u2019s [a] very, \nvery frightening scenario.\u201d \nSteve: \u201cWell there\u2019s echoes of science fiction coming through, Brave New World, to \nspace exploration, super new transit systems and just human evolution as well, being \naccelerated.\u201d \nNeil: \u201cBut going back to our earlier conversation about the pace of change and there \ndoesn\u2019t seem to be any stopping it, this is only 10-9, so 20 years on are we on 10-12 and \n10-15, this is just the next step \u2026\u201d \nBarry: \u201cExactly. When do you get to that final point, the absolute if you like? They may be \nnearly there but they may not be.\u201d \n (Group 1) \nThese were not gut reactions to some rather optimistic claims of the benefits of a \nparticular technology. Rather, they represented deeper unease with the metaphysical \nprogramme driving the technology, its embedded assumptions of what constitutes human \nprogress and improvement, and its potentially troubling implications for wider society. \nHowever, perhaps even more than biotechnologies, here was a technological programme \nbased on a style of thought that conceives of nature and humans as infinitely malleable, and \nwhich presents a thoroughly questionable view of human improvement as a given. For \nDupuy, who has developed perhaps the most systematic critique of the metaphysical \nprogramme that underpins radical nanotechnology, the most conspicuous element of the \nnanotechnological dream is its dissatisfaction with the world as inherited through \u2018bricolage\u2019 \nand \u2018hit and miss\u2019 evolutionary process (Dupuy, 2009). By contrast, the world \u2013 and its \ncomponent constituents of living and non-living matter \u2013 is in principle reconstructable and \nthus available for redesign and improvement, literally from the bottom-up, atom by atom \n(NSTC, 1999). This can thus be seen as an extension of a biopolitical style of thought, \nengendered through biotechnological innovation, in which the biological can no longer be \nassumed to impose limits to human endeavour and well-being (Franklin 2003; Rose, 2007). \nIndeed, nanotechnology\u2019s much cited goal of \u2018controlling the structure of matter\u2019 through \ninterventions at the nanoscale (from 1 \u2013 100 nm), is at that precise scale at which the \ndistinction between life and non-life has lost all meaning. For Dupuy (2009) this represents a \nclandestine attempt to blur a fundamental distinction that has until now been a significant \nsource of everyday moral judgement and ethical reason.  \nThe imputed ideal of a hyper-technological age involving radical \u2018improvements\u2019 in bodily \nfunction and capacity was debated in other groups. While superficially appealing to some, \nthese developments were seen to raise substantial moral and social issues, not least the \nability for governments, industry and other darker forces to exercise sufficiently robust \nforms of control and oversight over its mediation on everyday life activities. The consensual \nresponse was to appeal for such innovations to \u2018slow down\u2019 to ensure that scientific advance \nwas properly in tune with wider public values and societal oversight. The discussion below \nhighlights the sensed dangers of technology proceeding as if it, and we, were was not part of \nlife and natural process: \nSally: \u201cI find it quite daunting actually, I find it a bit scary.\u201d \nMacnaghten RESEARCHING TECHNOSCIENTIC CONCERNS IN-THE-MAKING \n \n 9\nRochelle: \u201cThis is the vision of the robotic environment with everything controlled for \nyou and everything 100% perfect and plastic.\u201d \nRenee: \u201cIt\u2019s like even the food\u2026 Food has got a process the same as we\u2019ve got a natural \nprocess you know, you\u2019re born, you get older, you get wrinkles, you die. Same as fruit, \nyou buy a piece of fruit it\u2019s healthy, after a piece of time it wrinkles you throw it away \nor whatever and that is a natural process and I think in some ways it\u2019s kind of fiddling \nwith that natural process.\u201d \nModerator: \u201cSo you think skin should be allowed to wrinkle?\u201d \n (Group 4) \nHow should one characterise the ethical character of concerns that are being appealed \nto? As with Davies\u2019 (2006) characterisation of ethical talk on xenotransplantation, it is \napparent that nanotechnologies have the potential to blur key distinctions through which \nsocial life is ordered. This constitutes the second explanation and includes, inter alia, the \nblurring of the idea that enhancement is distinct from therapy, that we can never completely \nget rid of diseases, that humans live and die, that humans and machines are fundamentally \ndistinct, that matter can be made from the bottom up, and that everything can be made, \nunmade and remade1. It is the perceived neglect of such boundary work within the broader \nnanotechnology community  \u2013 or what Dupuy (2009) calls a false humility that consists in \ndenying that anyone has been done out of the ordinary - that people found disturbing, as \nillustrated in one particular apt remark by a participant in Group 5: \u2018It\u2019s like nanotechnology \nis the new God\u2019. This comment, deploying the \u2018false humility\u2019 narrative, reflects not simply \nthe perceived lack of limits in much of nanotechnology talk, but the more troubling \nperception that nanoscientists were proceeding with little regard or understanding or even \nawareness of the endeavour in which they were participating. In particular, and making use \nof an older set of metaphysical assumptions premised on the notion that there exists a wider \npatterning and order to life which we ignore at our peril, were expressed concerns about the \n\u2018unnaturalness\u2019 of the undertaking. One way in which this was expressed was in arguments \non the likelihood of \u2018nature\u2019s revenge\u2019: that the more radical and interventionist the attempt \nto control and intervene in nature the stronger and more potent the likely retort. The \nexchange below articulates the use of such a \u2018Promeathean\u2019 narrative, and of nature taking \nvengeance as a direct consequence of human interference and meddling: \nJulie: \u201cThat\u2019s the problem, is what we\u2019re interfering with again is nature, the natural cycle \nof things, which is where I have a problem. It\u2019s partly that it is sort of right that \nsometimes crops are wiped out, there\u2019s sort of a reason for everything I think.\u201d \nRosie: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust nature not to seize upon it as it\u2019s done with these super-weeds\u2026\u201d \n (Group 2) \nAn interesting variant of the above critique were accounts arising from the mechanistic \nmetaphor that tends to imbue much nanotechnology rhetoric. Bernadette Bensaude-\nVincent analyses the ways in which molecular biology and materials science converge on a \nthoroughly \u2018artificialist view of nature\u2019. She sets out the multiple ways in which \nnanotechnologies rely on a conception of biological life and the human body using \nmechanistic concepts and metaphors: most notably around the cell and its molecular \ncomponents as nanoscale machines (Bensaude-Vincent, 2004). Using George Canguilhem as \ninspiration, she argues that that such a project has demonstrable ethical components, and \nthat the mechanization of life is inseparable from a project of instrumentalization of life and \ncontrol over nature. In our discussion groups, the extreme mechanization which \n                                                 \n1\n I am indebted to Alfred Nordmann for this observation. \nMacnaghten RESEARCHING TECHNOSCIENTIC CONCERNS IN-THE-MAKING \n \n 10\nnanotechnology represents was also seen as connected to forms of government and \ncorporate control and their propensity for new and more direct forms of subjection and \nsurveillance. This unease, making use of such \u2018artificialist\u2019 narrative, was voiced eloquently \nby the one of the London groups, that, \u2018we\u2019re turning into robots\u2019:  \nRenee: \u201cI mean it\u2019s exactly what somebody over here said before, we\u2019re turning into \nrobots. That is exactly what it sounds like\u2026\u201d \nRenee: \u201cWhen it comes directly to human beings and trying to make them\u2026, it\u2019s like \ntrying to make a perfect race again, going to that.\u201d \nKaren: \u201cWe just don\u2019t know the long term effects do we, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d \nRenee: \u201cBut you have to know the side effects and what we\u2019re letting ourselves in for.\u201d \nToni: \u201cSo basically our generation\u2019s going to be like the ones that they test this all out on, \nif it all goes horribly wrong, we\u2019ll be the guinea pigs.\u201d \n(Group 4) \nAgain Dupuy provides a metaphysical explanation to such commentary arguing that \nprecisely when \u2018being human\u2019 is reduced to the status of an object that can be fashioned \nand shaped at will \u2013 the very conception of mind as machine that enables us to imagine our \nability to recreate life and matter in our own image \u2013 we lose much of our ethical capacity \nfor critical reflection (Dupuy, 2009). Without ethical boundaries grounded in a conception of \nsocial order the concept of self limitation loses meaning. In such an ethically restricted world \nthere is little reason to presume why nanotechnologies will not be deployed to extend \ncontrol and reduce autonomy. The exchange points to the forms of subjection that a \nprogramme of human enhancement was seen as likely to engender: \nPaul: \u201cI think the worrying thing for me\u2026 is that it\u2019s almost as though we lose control of \nwhat\u2019s going on because the technology itself is capable of almost taking, replicating, \nand almost making, you know, pretty much making its own decisions.\u201d \nPhilip: \u201cI think that is a big problem. It\u2019s like the thing you were saying with the creativity \nas well. If the human controls the technology that\u2019s fine, as soon as it becomes the \ntechnology making all the decisions then that\u2019s when you have a problem, because\u2026 \nhumans are completely different from a computer.\u201d \nPaul: \u201cThere\u2019s some scary dark futures where you have strains of children who are, and \nare not enhanced in some way, and that\u2019s a really dodgy thing. I mean enhancement, \nthe ageing process and things like that\u2026\u201d \nJames: \u201cDo you have your kids injected at birth to enhance their, the way their muscles \ngrow and things\u2026\u201d \n (Group 5) \nThe above dynamics contributed to the sensed difficulty of developing robust and \neffective systems of governance and regulation. One the one hand, there was a perceived \nrequirement for wise and strong forms of government and oversight. Yet, on the other hand, \nthere was a shared concern that governance structures and requirements would be \ncompromised, inevitably, by \u2018real-world\u2019 contingencies arising from the constraints of living \nin a globalised economy as well as the sensed intractability of nanotechnology\u2019s \nmetaphysical programme.  \nConclusions \nI conclude by reflecting on the reflexive politics of this particular piece of research, and \non its contribution to debates on the institutional governance of emerging technologies. It \nMacnaghten RESEARCHING TECHNOSCIENTIC CONCERNS IN-THE-MAKING \n \n 11\ncould be argued that this piece of public engagement research is limited for two reasons: for \nbeing too \u2018upstream\u2019 and thus not reflecting solid public opinion (see Rogers Hayden and \nPidgeon 2007 for a version of this criticism); and for having had little demonstrable direct \ninput into matters of practical governance. However, in response, the purpose of the \nresearch was not intended to inform directly public policy. Rather, the purpose was to seek \nto characterize emergent public opinion, and to develop a methodology and mode of \nanalysis for researching technoscientific concerns in-the-making (see also Macnaghten et al, \n2005). The subsequent results were indeed shaped by the research design but again that \nwas precisely the point: to expose participants to the styles of thought in which the \ntechnology is being framed in the public domain such as to reflexively examine the power of \nsuch narrative forms. Finally, while the research process may have inadvertently masked \ndifference within the public groups it nevertheless presented a picture of emergent public \nopinion characterized by a dense array of issues that remain woefully under-represented \nand marginal to public policy discourse. Indeed, notwithstanding the recent move in critical \npublic engagement studies, away from emphases on talk and discourse and towards a focus \non the embodied and performative dimensions of deliberative practices (see, for example, \nChilvers, 2008; Davies and Burgess, 2004; Irwin, 2006), this paper suggests that innovative \nand theoretically-informed group talk offers an enduring medium to critically engage with a \nfuture-oriented techno-scientific politics. \nPerhaps most significantly the research offers an explanation as to why people expressed \nsuch bleak and pessimistic views on the future prospects of the technology; that just when \nwe as a collectivity require strong ethical and regulatory governance structures to guide and \nshape the development of nanotechnologies in socially progressive and responsive \ndirections, that very possibility appears to be denied by a socio-technical system that \nbelieves that nothing special is being undertaken, that considers its dreams of control and \nimprovement to require little external endorsement or explanation, and that is embedded \nwithin a set of master narratives in which science and technology are staged unambiguously \nas the solution to a range of social ills (European Commission, 2007). Faced by such double-\nblind it is inevitable that people respond to what is at hand, mobilising the range of cultural \nresources and \u2018folk theories\u2019 through which they can make sense and render familiar a \nstrange, uncanny and potentially transformative set of technologies (Rip, 2006). For this \nreason the research sought to articulate the kinds of narrative strategies used by \nparticipants to justify their positions.  \nParallel research has outlined several prominent tropes and narratives underpinning \npublic responses to nanotechnology: ranging from the \u2018slippery slope\u2019 narrative, that \ntechnological advances that seem beneficial now will inevitably evoke further technological \nsteps and applications that are morally doubtful; the \u2018colonisation\u2019 narrative, that \ntechnology will spread out and ultimately colonise life denying autonomy and agency; the \n\u2018Dr Strangelove\u2019 narrative, that advanced science designed for \u2018good use\u2019 will become \ncorrupted and manipulated by evil people for evil purposes; the \u2018Trojan Horse\u2019 narrative, \nthat innovations developed for progressive purposes will in the long term have unforeseen \nand potentially irreversible effects; and the \u2018it\u2019s out\u2019 narrative, that involves the accidental \nrelease of harmful substances often due to technological and\/or human failure (Swierstra \nand Rip, 2007; Rejeski, 2007). In the research we can add at least five further narrative \nvariations. These include: the \u2018kept in the dark\u2019 narrative, that nanotechnology reflects a \nfurther instance of not being able to participate in decisions that will structure future social \nrelationships; the \u2018bodily invasion\u2019 narrative, that involves the introduction of invisible \nsubstances that subsequently violate natural processes; the \u2018Promethean\u2019 narrative, \ninvolving nature taking retribution on nanoscience\u2019s hubristic sense of its ability to transform \nMacnaghten RESEARCHING TECHNOSCIENTIC CONCERNS IN-THE-MAKING \n \n 12\nboth nature and humans to its own will and in violation and disregard for evolutionary \nprocess; the \u2018artificialist\u2019 narrative, that inadvertently instrumentalises life and human \nrelationships through conceiving of biological and mental life purely as machines; and the \n\u2018false modesty\u2019 narrative, involving the pretense that nothing special is being undertaken. \nThese narratives are by any means new. Many have their origins in ancient classics and \nphilosophy and have found on-going and enduring expression in the form of fables, morality \ntales, literature and more recently in films, science fiction and video games. However, just as \nJon Turney (1998) has analysed the long shadow of Frankenstein in debates on the new \ngenetics, one needs to understand why certain narrative forms continue to resonate and \nwhy they continue to provide an enduring resource for contemporary political argument and \nthought. My argument is that it is precisely these kind of narratives that will continue to \nshape popular perceptions of science and technology, and which will provide the landscape \nover which future techno-politics will be articulated. Of course, there exist counter \nnarratives too, around technology as progress, science as salvation and enabler through \nheroic discovery and breakthrough, and so on. But such narratives will be played out on the \nlarger cultural stage whose interplay will depend on complex institutional dynamics where \nthe telos of scientific endeavour \u2013 its purposes, priorities and imaginings \u2013 will come to be \nincreasingly scrutinised. \nThere is a further reflexive element that warrants attention. Bensaude-Vincent (2004) has \nhighlighted a marginal voice within the nanoscience community \u2013 comprising largely of \nchemists such as George Whitesides and Richard Smalley and in stark opposition to the hard \nengineering paradigm promoted by Eric Drexler \u2013 who advocate a different model of \nnanotechnology and its relationship with nature. Unlike Drexler\u2019s machines with their \nunderlying and driving aspirations to emulate and improve on nature, Whitesides and \ncolleagues posit nature as \u2018art\u2019, and of nanotechnology as offering ingenious and artful \nsolutions to complex problems in nature. Such an understanding of what nanotechnology is \nproposing to do with regards to nature fits within a historical tradition of human technique \n(or arts) working in harmony with nature, as revealing the powers inherent in nature, and as \nmimicking the tricks that nature actually uses to solve our own problems. It remains an open \nquestion whether this different configuration of nanotechnology\u2019s metaphysical project \nwould offer a differing ethical response. If such a metaphysical programme were to rise in \nprominence, and to be given official recognition in institutional programmes of nanoscience, \nwe might question the enduring coherence of nanotechnology\u2019s future-oriented visions, and \nindeed, of the very meaning of the category of emerging nanotechnologies. \nFinally, there remains the thorny question of the relationship between emergent public \nattitudes and the institutional governance of emerging technologies. In a previous research \nproject on emergent public attitudes to genetically modified crops and foods, conducted in \n1996 in the UK two years prior to the public controversy that took place between 1998 and \n2000, public groups were found to express profound ambivalence towards the technology \n(Grove-White et al, 1997). This arose for multiple reasons that included: shared perceptions \nof inevitability and fatalism; mistrust in the integrity and adequacy of government \nregulation; unease about the apparent transgression of moral boundaries for no apparent \n\u2018good reason\u2019; and disquiet about the limits of \u2018expert\u2019 knowledge in anticipating \nconceivable and potentially irreversible mishaps. The relationship between such emergent \npublic attitudes and the subsequent and unprecedented political rows of 1998-1999 is \ncomplicated and uneven. However, what is undoubtedly the case is that the institutional \nhandling of the controversy \u2013 notably its denial of adverse public responses as reasonable \u2013 \ncreated the conditions under which public reactions and subsequent mobilization came to \nMacnaghten RESEARCHING TECHNOSCIENTIC CONCERNS IN-THE-MAKING \n \n 13\nbe significant, inter alia, through NGO campaigns, media coverage, food labelling, \nsupermarket purchasing, consumer boycotts, and subsequent political debate (Grove-White \net al, 2000; AEBC, 2001). Another way to read this dynamic was as follows. While the \nresearch process had fostered the creation of the \u2018technoscientific citizen\u2019, who became \nauthorised to hold opinions on the social, ethical, environmental and health dimensions of \nthe technology, the subsequent and novel opportunity structures authorised the creation of \nthe activist technoscientific citizen who was now able to enact such opinions through an \narray of everyday consumer and lifestyle practices. \nThe message for policy institutions is that public reactions to emerging nanotechnologies \nhave the potential to become significant so long as the questions that appear to underpin \nemergent public attitudes remain occluded from public dialogue and processes of decision-\nmaking. One role of the social sciences is to examine the dynamics through which a \nnanotechnological gaze opens up new configurations of minds, bodies, relationships, \nresponsibilities, subjection, surveillance, finitude, choice, risk, self-limitation, autonomy and \nmuch more. Key questions in this vital politics include: the question of limits to intervention \non nature and associated assumptions of control; the ability for advanced technology to \ntransgress moral orderings; the inadvertent social effects arising from an artificialist account \nof nature and what an alternative might look like in practice; and to whether it is prudent to \nexperiment with technologies likely to produce irreversible effects. Developing the \nconversation, in partnership with the wider scientific and policy community, and with an eye \ntowards long-term shifts in R&D practice, will be a major endeavour in which the policy-\noriented critical social scientist has a distinct role. \n \nAcknowledgements \nI would like to acknowledge support from the Economic and Social Research Council for the \nproject \u2018Nanotechnology, risk and sustainability: developing upstream models of public \nengagement\u2019 (award no: RES-338-25-0006) out of which this analysis was developed.
