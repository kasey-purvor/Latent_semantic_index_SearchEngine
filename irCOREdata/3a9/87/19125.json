It is speci\ufb01cally associated\nwith presenting lipid antigens that activate the distinctive class of\nT cells known as invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells. iNKT cells\ndisplay characteristics of both T cells and NK cells and play a\ncrucial role in diverse immune responses and other pathologic con-\nditions.1\u20134 When the synthetic glycolipid a-galactosyl ceramide\n(a-GalCer),5 also known as KRN7000 (1, Fig. 1), is bound to CD1d\nand presented to T cell receptors (TCRs) on the surface of iNKT\ncells, the latter are activated to release diverse cytokines, including\nboth Th1 and Th2 cytokines.6\u20138 Similar results are obtained with\nthe more readily obtained C24:0 analogue (2, Fig. 1).9,10 It is be-\nlieved that the release of Th1 cytokines may contribute to antitu-\nmour and antimicrobial functions, whilst the secretion of Th2\ncytokines may help alleviate autoimmune diseases11\u201313 such as\nmultiple sclerosis14 and arthritis.15 The opposing effects induced\nby Th1 and Th2 cytokines have complicated efforts to develop\nKRN7000 as a therapeutic agent, since it induces high levels of both\ntypes of cytokine and therefore may induce mixed and unpredict-\nable biological effects.16 Switching the C26:0 acyl chain of\nKRN7000 for a C20 11,14-cis-diene acyl chain modi\ufb01es the out-\ncome of iNKT cell activation and potently induces a Th2-biased\ncytokine response.9 This C20:2 analogue (3, Fig. 1) also exhibits less\nstringent requirements for loading on to CD1d.10\nAlthough extensive studies have examined the impact on the\niNKT cell-stimulating activities of modi\ufb01cations to the fatty acylll rights reserved.and sphingosine structures of a-GalCer, there has been less analy-\nsis of the effects of structural modi\ufb01cations of the carbohydrate\nhead group.17 Subtle changes in this part of the glycolipid are likely\nto have signi\ufb01cant effects on iNKT cell recognition since the mono-\nsaccharide group is exposed and makes direct contacts with the\nTCR in complexes formed by the binding of a-GalCer to CD1d.18\nTo this end, we now report the synthesis and preliminary biologi-\ncal activity of a-glucosyl ceramide analogues 4 and 5 (Fig. 2).OH OH\n54\nFigure 2.

J. Jervis et al. \/ Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 20 (2010) 3475\u20133478Since targets 4 and 5 differ only in their acyl chain substitution,\nwe elected to pursue a synthetic strategy that would allow the\nintroduction of this point of diversity in the \ufb01nal step. We therefore\nexamined several routes to amine 11 from which both glucosyl\nceramide targets would then be accessed through chemoselective\nacylation of the amino residue. The key challenge in a synthesis\nof amine 11 is to form the glycosidic linkage with high a-selectiv-\nity. To this end, we \ufb01rst opted to employ a stereospeci\ufb01c glucosy-\nlation method developed by Bols (Scheme 1).19 This method\ninvolves the use of a silyl tether to attach the acceptor temporarily\nto the 2-position of the glucosyl donor prior to the key glycosyla-\ntion step. Glycosylation proceeds with 1,2-syn speci\ufb01city, owing\nto the formation of a \ufb01ve-membered silylacetal intermediate,\nwhich in the case of glucosyl donors, ensures the formation of\nthe a-glycoside product. Thioglucoside 7, synthesised in three\nsteps from D-glucal 6,20 was reacted with a \ufb01vefold excess of\ndichlorodimethylsilane. This reaction afforded a silyl chloride\nintermediate, which, after removal of the excess dichlorosilane re-\nagent under reduced pressure, reacted with known alcohol 821 to\nform mixed silyl acetal 9, our glucosylation precursor, in modest\nyield. Treatment of silyl acetal 9 with N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) fur-\nnished the desired glucoside 10 as a single diastereoisomer, albeit\nin modest yield. Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl groups and reduc-\ntion of the azide in 10 using Pd(OH)2 as the catalyst,22 provided\nour acylation precursor, amine 11 in 57% yield (Scheme 1).\nAlthough this synthetic approach allowed a completely stereo-\nselective route to our target amine 11, a number of steps in the se-\nquence suffered from poor yields, which hindered access to\nsigni\ufb01cant quantities of material. We therefore examined other\nglycosylation methods. Kobayashi has described a stereoselective\na-glycosylation using a galactosyl bromide generated in situ from\n2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl galactose.23 Unfortunately, we found that\nglycosylation using the corresponding glucosyl bromide derived\nfrom 12 afforded signi\ufb01cant amounts of the unwanted b-anomer\n(Scheme 2). The use of perbenzylated glucosyl \ufb02uoride 1324 also\nprovided a mixture of a- and b-glycosides 14, which proved dif\ufb01-\ncult to separate (Scheme 2).\nWe therefore turned our attention to the use of glucosyl\niodides,25 speci\ufb01cally per-TMS-protected glucosyl iodide 16, as\nan alternative donor. Du et al. have shown that the corresponding\ngalactosyl iodide provides excellent levels of a-selectivity with aOBnO\nBnO\nOH\nOBn\nSEt\nOHO\nHO\nOH\nD-glucal\nref 20\n(3 steps)\nOBnO\nBnO\nO\nOBn\nSEt\nSi O\nN3 OBn\nOBn\n13\nOBnO\nBnO\nOBn\nHOO\nOBn\nOBn\n13\nN3\nOHO\nHO\nOH\nHOO\nOH\nOH\n13\nNH2\n6\n7\n9\n1011\nHO\nN3 OBn\nOBn\n13\nacceptor  8\na,b\nd\nc\nScheme 1.

We reasoned that the\nuse of phytosphingosine acceptor 17,27 in which the internal\n1,2-diol is protected as an acetal, would deliver the completely\nO-deprotected glucoside 18 upon acid work-up. To this end,\n1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-trimethylsilyl glucose 15, which is commercially\navailable or can be readily synthesised on large scale by treating\nglucose with a mixture of TMSCl and hexamethyldisilazane\n(HMDS) in pyridine,28 was converted to glycosyl iodide 16 by treat-\nment with TMSI in CH2Cl2 (Scheme 3). Adding a solution of crude\n16 to a solution of alcohol 17, nBu4NI, H\u00fcnig\u2019s base and 4 \u00c5 molec-\nular sieves in CH2Cl2 successfully effected glycosylation. Treating\nthe initially formed glycoside product with p-toluenesulfonic acid\n(pTSA) in methanol provided the fully O-deprotected glycoside\n18 as a single anomer. Although the yield for this three-step pro-\ncess was a modest 45%, we now had very rapid access to our target\nmolecules. A \ufb01nal Staudinger reduction of azide 18 delivered our\nrequisite amine 11 in quantitative yield (Scheme 3).29 This reaction\nsequence is short and scalable and proved to be particularly\neffective for accessing multigram quantities of amine 11.

Both reactions provided the desired amide prod-\nucts 4 and 5 in good yields (Scheme 3).30,31\nTo assess the biological activity of the a-glucosyl ceramides 4\nand 5 and compare these to KRN7000 1 and the a-galactosyl cera-\nmide analogues 2 (C24:0) and 3 (C20:2), we assessed the ability of\neach compound to induce the expansion of iNKT cells in samples of\nhuman peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) during an\neight-day in vitro culture.32 The results showed that both the per-\ncentages and absolute numbers of iNKT cells in the cultures were\nmarkedly increased to similar levels by stimulation with both of\nthe a-GlcCer analogues 4 and 5 ( Fig. 3). The level of iNKT cell\nexpansion, at least with a relatively high concentration of the gly-\ncolipids (250 nM), was comparable for both of the N-acyl variants\nof a-GlcCer and very similar to levels obtained with the related\na-GalCer analogues (2 (C24:0) and 3 (C20:2)) and with the proto-\ntypical iNKT cell activator KRN7000 (1 (C26:0)). Representative\npro\ufb01les obtained by \ufb02ow cytometry of cultures from one normal\nblood donor are shown in Figure 3A. This analysis was carried\nout with PBMC from four separate donors (Fig. 3B). Although differ-\nences were observed for the levels of iNKT cell expansion between\ndifferent donors, all donors responded well to the two a-GlcCer\nanalogues. In all cases, these responses were similar to those gen-\nerated by the analogous a-GalCer compounds.Figure 3. Ex vivo expansion of human iNKT cells by a-GlcCer and a-GalCer\nanalogues. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from four different donors\nwere stimulated with the indicated glycolipids at a concentration of 250 nM in the\npresence of low levels of exogenous IL-2 and IL-7. At day 8, cultures were harvested\nand analysed by \ufb02ow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies speci\ufb01c for CD3 and\nfor the invariant TCRa chain expressed by iNKT cells (6B11). (A) Dot plots showing\nrelative levels of CD3+ 6B11+ iNKT cells are shown for one representative donor.\nNumbers in upper right quadrant indicate percentages of total lymphocytes that are\niNKT cells. (B) Absolute numbers of iNKT cells in the cultures were determined by\n\ufb02ow cytometry using \ufb02uorescent counting beads, and the values of iNKT cell fold\nexpansion were determined by dividing by the input number of iNKT cells.The strong biological activity of the a-GlcCer compounds was\nconsistent with \ufb01ndings from the initial study that described the\nreactivity of CD1d-restricted iNKT cells to synthetic glycosylcera-\nmides.5 This showed an a-GlcCer with a C26 saturated acyl group\nto be stimulatory for mouse iNKT cells, with a level of activity only\nslightly less than that of KRN7000 (1). Our analysis con\ufb01rms the\nactivity of a-GlcCer compounds as ligands for human iNKT cells.\nIt is also notable that we observed human iNKT cell activation\nand expansion for an a-GlcCer with a shorter acyl chain containing\nunsaturations (5). Previous work with analogues of a-GalCer con-\ntaining C20:2 or other unsaturated fatty acyl groups revealed a\nmarked tendency for these to bias iNKT cell-dependent cytokine\nresponses in mice to give preferential secretion of Th2 cytokines\nsuch as IL-4 and IL-13.9 This Th2 cytokine bias has been associated\nwith therapeutic bene\ufb01ts in a variety of mouse models of autoim-\nmune and in\ufb02ammatory diseases, indicating potential therapeutic\napplications for such glycolipids in human diseases.17 It will thus\nbe important to determine whether compound 5 or other a-GlcCer\nanalogues bearing an unsaturated acyl chain also show an ability\nto induce Th2-biased cytokine responses, which is a focus for fu-\nture studies.\nIn summary, we have developed an ef\ufb01cient route to a-glucosyl\nceramides that provided two biologically active ligands 4 and 5 for\nstimulation of human iNKT cell responses. Of the range of glycosyl-\nation methods that were investigated for accessing the target\nmolecules with high levels of stereoselectivity, the use of per-\nTMS-protected glucosyl iodide 16 as the donor is the most attrac-\ntive, reacting with acceptor 17 to provide a single a-glycoside\nproduct. This glycosylation reaction is also scalable and with an\nacidic work-up effecting global deprotection, followed by Stau-\ndinger reduction of the azide, allows rapid access to advanced\nintermediate 11, which can now be used to provide a broad range\nof a-GlcCer compounds with different acyl chains. Compounds\nproduced using this approach will assist in expanding the current\nunderstanding of the structure\u2013activity relationships for glycolipid\nactivators of iNKT cells, which is of central importance to the fur-\nther development of this class of compounds as clinically useful\nimmunomodulators.\nAcknowledgements\nG.S.B. acknowledges support from a Personal Research Chair\nfrom Mr. James Bardrick, a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit\nAward, a former Lister Institute-Jenner Research Fellowship, the\nMedical Research Council and The Wellcome Trust (084923\/B\/08\/\nZ).

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained by Ficoll\u2013Hypaque\ncentrifugation of leukocyte concentrates obtained from healthy volunteer\nblood donors. For ex vivo expansion of human iNKT cells, 4 million PBMC were\ncultured in wells of 24-well tissue culture plates in RPMI-1640 medium with\n10% foetal calf serum and recombinant IL-2 (60 IU\/mL) and IL-7 (5 ng\/mL)\n(Peprotech). Glycolipids were solubilised in 100% DMSO and added directly to\nculture media to achieve a \ufb01nal concentration of 250 nM. Control wells\nreceived an amount of DMSO vehicle identical to that added with the\nglycolipids (0.00125%). Cultures were incubated for 8 days at 37 \u0003C in a 5%\nCO2 humidi\ufb01ed incubator. Cultures were harvested and the cells stained with\n\ufb02uorochrome labelled monoclonal antibodies speci\ufb01c for CD3 and the iNKT cell\nTCR (6B11, eBiosciences). Samples were also stained with propidium iodide to\nexclude dead cells, and a known number of Caltag \ufb02uorescent counting beads\n(Invitrogen) were added to the samples to allow quantitation of absolute cell\nnumbers. The total number of iNKT cells (CD3+, 6B11+, PI negative\nlymphocytes) was calculated by normalising according to counting beads\nand the fold expansion values were calculated based on the initial number of\niNKT cells. Data were collected on a FACSCalibur \ufb02ow cytometer using\nCellQuest software (BD Biosciences).\n"}
