INTRODUCTION\nTwenty-five years after Hawking showed that black holes\nemit thermal radiation @1#, the apparent loss of quantum me-\nchanical unitarity in the presence of a black hole remains an\noutstanding problem for theoretical physics. We expect that\nthis \u2018\u2018information puzzle,\u2019\u2019 which represents a fundamental\ntension between general relativity and quantum mechanics,\nshould either be erased or explained in a quantum theory of\ngravity. In recent years string theory has explained micro-\nscopically the huge degeneracy required to account for the\nentropy of certain extremal black holes. However, there has\nbeen no insight into why this degeneracy of states is related\nto something geometric such as the area of a horizon. More\nfundamentally, the information puzzle remains exactly\nthat\u2014a puzzle.\nThis paper is the first in a series investigating the black\nhole information puzzle in the context of string theory. In\ngeneral relativity, the simplest context for black hole forma-\ntion is gravity in three dimensions where there are no local\ndynamics. In the presence of a negative cosmological con-\nstant, 3D gravity possesses black hole solutions @2#. There is\nalso a family of conical defects, the so-called point particles\n@3#. These solutions interpolate between the vacuum solution\n(AdS3 with mass M521 in conventional units! and the\nblack hole spectrum which starts at M50. Exact solutions of\n3D gravity are known in which the collision of conical de-\nfects forms a black hole @4#. We would like to use these\nsimple classical processes to study the formation of higher\ndimensional black holes in string theory. To this end, we\nmust first embed the conical defects supersymmetrically in a\nhigher dimensional gravity arising from string theory. Pre-\nserving supersymmetry is important because the controlled\nquantization of black holes and solitons in string theory usu-\nally requires supersymmetry. The presence of the negative\ncosmological constant in three dimensions suggests that\nthere should be a dual description of such spaces in terms of\na two-dimensional conformal field theory @5#. Our goal is to\nfind such a dual picture and describe in it the process of\nblack hole formation from collision of conical defects. In @6#\nit was shown that the 3D conical defects and their collisions\ncan be detected in correlation functions of the dual CFT.\nHere we are interested in the direct description of the defects\nas objects in the dual.1\nType IIB supergravity compactified on K3 yields the chi-\nral N54b supergravity in six dimensions, coupled to 21\ntensor multiplets. This theory has classical solutions with the\ngeometry of AdS33S3. In Sec. II we will construct super-\nsymmetric solutions where the sphere is fibered over AdS3\nso that a minimum length circuit around the AdS3 base leads\nto a rotation of the sphere around an axis. Since AdS3 is\nsimply connected, the fiber must break down at a point.\nUpon dimensional reduction to the base this produces super-\nsymmetric conical defects in three dimensions. In fact, the\nidentical objects have been obtained previously as solutions\nto extended 211 supergravity in the Chern-Simons formu-\nlation @8,9#. The U(1) Wilson lines used in these construc-\ntions to obtain a Bogomol\u2019nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield ~BPS!\nsolution arise in our case from the Kaluza-Klein gauge field\nassociated with the fibration. Our Kaluza-Klein ansatz for\nreducing the action and equations of motion of 6D gravity to\nthe 3D base does not yield precisely a Chern-Simons theory.\nNevertheless, the dimensionally reduced system admits solu-\ntions with vanishing field strength, for which the analysis of\n*Electronic address: vijay@endive.hep.upenn.edu\n\u2020Electronic address: jdeboer@wins.uva.nl\n\u2021 Electronic address: keskivak@rock.helsinki.fi\n\u00a7 Electronic address: S.F.Ross@durham.ac.uk\n1It would also be interesting to make contact with the investiga-\ntions of spherical shells in @7#.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW D, VOLUME 64, 064011\n0556-2821\/2001\/64~6!\/064011~19!\/$20.00 \u00a92001 The American Physical Society64 064011-1\nsupersymmetry remains unchanged\u2014the holonomy of Kill-\ning spinors under the spin connection is canceled by the\nholonomy under the gauge connection. Various details of\nsphere compactifications of 6D, N54b supergravity are re-\nviewed in the main text and the Appendixes.2\nIt is well known that a horospheric patch of the AdS3\n3S3 geometry can be obtained as a near-horizon limit of the\nblack string soliton of 6D supergravity @12#. Compactifying\nthe extremal string solution on a circle yields the black holes\nof five dimensional string theory whose states were counted\nin the classic paper @13#.3 The near-horizon limit of these\nsolutions yields the BTZ black holes times S3 @12#. In Sec.\nIII we show that the fibered S3 solutions described above\narise as the near-horizon geometries of an extremal limit of\nspinning 6-dimensional strings compactified on a circle. In-\nterestingly, when the angular momentum is suitably chosen,\nglobal AdS33S3 is recovered as a solution. We discuss vari-\nous properties of the solution, including the nature of the\nconical singularity and potential Gregory-Laflamme insta-\nbilities in the approach to extremality.\nThe near-horizon limit of the six dimensional black string\nis also a decoupling limit for the worldvolume conformal\nfield theory ~CFT! description of the soliton. Following the\nreasoning of @5# we conclude that the BPS conical defects\ndescribed above should enjoy a non-perturbative dual de-\nscription in the worldvolume CFT of the black string\u2014i.e., a\ndeformation of the orbifold sigma model (K3)N\/SN @15#.\nWhen reduced to the AdS base, the fibered geometries ap-\npearing in our solutions carry a U~1! charge measured by the\nWilson line holonomy. Within the AdS-CFT duality, this\nspacetime U~1! charge translates into an R charge of the dual\nsystem. In Sec. IV, we propose that the conical defects are\ndescribed in the dual as an ensemble of the chiral primaries\ncarrying the same R charge. In subsequent papers we will\ntest this proposal and then use it to analyze the spacetime\nscattering of conical defects.\nII. CONICAL DEFECTS FROM KALUZA-KLEIN\nREDUCTION\nIn this section, we obtain the supersymmetric conical de-\nfects in 3D via Kaluza-Klein reduction of the six-\ndimensional N54b supergravity. Defects in three dimen-\nsions that involve just the metric and gauge fields with a\nChern-Simons action have been obtained previously @8#. We\nwill construct a Kaluza-Klein ansatz for six dimensional\ngravity which reproduces these defects upon dimensional re-\nduction.\nWe begin by reviewing the structure of the 3D conical\ndefects. The action with a negative cosmological constant is\nS5\n1\n16pG3\nE\nM\nd3xA2gS R1 2l2D\n2\n1\n8pG3\nE\n]M\nA2hS u1 1l D , ~1!\nwhere u is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the bound-\nary. The boundary term A2hu renders the equations of mo-\ntion well-defined, leading to the solutions\nds252S r2l2 2M 3D dt21S r\n2\nl2 2M 3D\n21\ndr21r2df2, ~2!\nwhere f;f12p . M 3521 is the vacuum, global anti\u2013de\nSitter space (AdS3). The boundary term A2h\/l renders the\naction finite for any solution that approaches the vacuum\nsufficiently rapidly at infinity @16#. The mass of these solu-\ntions can then be computed following @16,17# to be M\n5M 3\/8G3. The M 3>0 solutions are the non-rotating BTZ\nblack holes @2# while the spacetimes in the range 21,M 3\n<0 are conical defects @3#. To display the defect, let g2[\n2M 3 and rescale the coordinates: t\u02c6[tg , r\u02c6[r\/g , and f\u02c6\n5fg . Then\nds252S 11 r\u02c6 2l2 D dt\u02c621S 11 r\u02c6 2l2 D\n21\ndr\u02c6 21r\u02c6 2df\u02c6 2, ~3!\nwhere f\u02c6 ;f\u02c6 12pg , manifestly exhibiting a deficit angle of\ndf\u02c6 52p~12g!. ~4!\nIn these coordinates the mass measured with respect to trans-\nlations in t\u02c6 is M52A2M 3\/8G3.\nWe are looking for an embedding of these solutions in the\nN54b chiral supergravity in six dimensions @18#, coupled to\ntensor multiplets. The theory has self-dual tensor fields, so it\nhas solutions where three directions are spontaneously com-\npactified on S3; the vacuum for this sector is AdS3, and the\nspectrum of fluctuations around this vacuum solution has\nbeen computed @19\u201321#. We seek a supersymmetric solution\nwhere AdS3 is replaced by a conical defect.\nIn extended three dimensional supergravity, the conical\ndefects can be made supersymmetric @8#. These BPS defects\nachieve supersymmetry by canceling the holonomy of\nspinors under the spin connection by the holonomy under a\nWilson line of a flat gauge field appended to the solution.\nThus, we will consider a Kaluza-Klein ansatz which involves\nnon-trivial Kaluza-Klein gauge fields ~leading to a fibered S3\nin the 6D geometry! and the three dimensional metric, since\nthese were the only fields present in the extended three-\ndimensional supergravities.\nFamously, three-dimensional gravity can be written as a\nsum two SL(2,R) Chern-Simons theories. The sphere reduc-\ntion of six-dimensional, N54b gravity has symmetries ap-\npropriate to the SU(1,1u 2)3SU(1,1u 2) Chern-Simons su-\npergravity ~see @22,23,21,24,25,9# and references therein!.\nWe will show that the three-dimensional equations of motion\nobtained from our Kaluza-Klein ansatz contain the ~bosonic!\n2Sphere compactifications have been extensively studied in the\nliterature. See @10# for a review, and the recent work @11# for refer-\nences.\n3The AdS3 and Ban\u02dcados-Teitelboim-Zanelli ~BTZ! geometries can\nalso be related to the near-horizon limit of extremal four dimen-\nsional black holes @14#, by constructing the black holes as the near\nhorizon limit of intersecting 5-branes in M theory.\nVIJAY BALASUBRAMANIAN et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW D 64 064011\n064011-2\nsolutions of this theory. However, the six-dimensional action\ndoes not reduce to Chern-Simons in three dimensions. In\nfact, the equations of motion obtained from our ansatz are\nnot obtainable from a three-dimensional action; we would\nhave to include some non-trivial scalars in our general ansatz\nto obtain a consistent truncation to a three-dimensional ac-\ntion. That is, while our ansatz shows that we can construct\nsolutions of the six-dimensional theory using all the solu-\ntions of the SU(1,1u 2)3SU(1,1u 2) supergravity, asking that\nthe ansatz solve the six-dimensional equations does not in\ngeneral give the equations of motion of a three-dimensional\ntheory.\nThe minimal N54b theory contains a graviton eMA , four\nleft-handed gravitini cMr , and five antisymmetric tensor\nfields BMN\ni\n. The latter transform under the vector represen-\ntation of Spin(5). We adopt a notation where curved space-\ntime indices are M ,N50, . . . ,5 for the full six-dimensional\ngeometry; m ,n50, . . . ,2 in the AdS base; m ,n51, . . . ,3 on\nthe sphere. The flat tangent space indices are: A ,B\n50, . . . ,5, which parametrize six-dimensional @SO(1,5)#\ntangent vectors; a ,b50, . . . ,2, which index AdS3 @SO\n(1,2)# tangent vector indices; a ,b51, . . . ,3, indexing S3\n@SO(3)# tangent vectors. The Kaluza-Klein gauge symmetry\narising from the isometries of S3 is SO(4)5SU(2)3SU(2).\nIn our conventions, I ,J51, . . . ,6 index SO(4), while i , j\n51, . . . ,3 index SU(2), as do i8, j8. For Spin(5), i , j\n51, . . . ,5 labels the vector representation, while r ,s\n51, . . . ,4 labels the spinors.\nWe will not discuss the field content of the tensor multi-\nplets to which the minimal N54b theory is coupled in de-\ntail. The only piece of information that we need in the re-\nmainder is that tensor multiplets contain two-form fields with\nanti-self-dual three-form field strengths.\nA. Kaluza-Klein reduction reexamined\nConsiderable work has been carried out on the topic of\nsphere compactifications ~see the review @10# and the recent\nworks @11# for further references!. The discussion below\nshould serve as a review in a simplified setting.\nThe metric. A general compactification of six-dimensional\ngravity on a three dimensional compact space takes the form\nds25gmndxmdxn1gmnDxmDxn, ~5!\nDxm5dxm2Am\nI KI\nmdxm. ~6!\nThe Kaluza-Klein gauge fields Am\nI are associated with the\nKilling vectors KI\nm of the compact space. ~Note that the in-\ndices I can be raised and lowered by the metric d IJ .)\nWe choose gmn to be the round metric on S3. Thus, we do\nnot include any scalars in our ansatz; as stated earlier, this is\nmotivated by the absence of scalar fields in the 3D Chern-\nSimons supergravities with which we seek to make contact.\nThen there are six Killing vectors arising from the SO(4)\nisometry group, and it is manifest that the metric is invariant\nunder SO(4) gauge transformations:\ndxm5e IKI\nm\n, ~7!\ndxm50, ~8!\ndAm\nI 5]me\nI1 f JKIAmJ eK. ~9!\nHere f JKI are the SO(4) structure constants, expressed in\nterms of the Killing vectors as\nf IJKKKm5KIn]nKJm2KJn]nKIm . ~10!\nThe SO(4) gauge invariance of Eq. ~5! follows from the\ntransformations of gmn and Dxm:\ndDxm5e I]nKI\nmDxn, ~11!\ndgmn[e IKI\nr]rgmn\n52grne I]mKI\nr2gmre I]nKI\nr\n. ~12!\nObserve that Dxm transforms under a local gauge transfor-\nmation in the same way as dxm under a global gauge\ntransformation\u2014D is like a covariant exterior derivative.\nThe 3-form. We must have a non-zero 3-form to satisfy\nthe equations of motion. We will consider turning on just one\nof the five three-form fields HMNP\ni\n. We require an SO(4)\ngauge invariant ansatz for this 3-form field. Let\nV~xm!emnrdxm\u2018dxn\u2018dxr, W~xm!emnrdxm\u2018dxn\u2018dxr\n~13!\nbe the volume forms on S3 and on the non-compact factor in\nEq. ~5! respectively. In terms of these forms, the six-\ndimensional equations of motion have an AdS33S3 solution\nof the form ~5! with vanishing Kaluza-Klein gauge fields and\na 3-form background\nH5\n1\nl @W~x\nm!emnrdxm\u2018dxn\u2018dxr\n1V~xm!emnrdxm\u2018dxn\u2018dxr# , ~14!\nwhere l is the radius of the S3. This cannot be quite right\nwhen the gauge fields are turned on, because it is not gauge\ninvariant.

However, we\nshould find a proposal for the 2-form potential BMN , rather\nthan the field strength H, which is only possible if dH50.\nThe exterior derivative of Eq. ~15! is computed using\ndDxm52FIKI\nm2Am\nI ]nKI\nmDxn\u2018dxm, ~16!\nwhere FI5 12 Fmn\nI dxm\u2018dxn.

PHYSICAL REVIEW D 64 064011\n064011-3\ndH52\n3\nl VemnrKI\nmFI\u2018Dxn\u2018Dxr, ~17!\nusing the SO(4) invariance of the S3 volume form and the\nfact that one cannot anti-symmetrize over more than three\nindices.\nWhen the gauge field is flat ~which is typically our inter-\nest! dH50, as desired. Nevertheless, it is worth seeking a\nmore generally valid ansatz. We wish to add a contribution to\nH that cancels the term on the right hand side of Eq. ~17!. To\nfind this, it is helpful to consider the 2-form v I\n5VemnrKI\nmdxn\u2018dxr which appears as part of Eq. ~17!. In\nterms of V , the volume form on S3, this 2-form can also be\nwritten as \u0131KIV . It is a standard fact that d\u0131KIV1\u0131KIdV\n5LKIV . Since the volume form is SO(4) invariant, and an-\nnihilated by d, it follows that v is closed. Therefore, since\nwe are on the three sphere there must be globally well de-\nfined one-form NIrdxr such that d(NIrdxr)5v . Assembling\nthese facts, a candidate Kaluza-Klein ansatz for a closed\n3-form is\nHKK5H1\n3\nl F\nI\u2018NIrDxr. ~18!\nThe 1-forms NIrdxr for S3 are related to the Killing one-\nforms and are derived explicitly in Appendix B. The choice\nof NIr given there satisfy the relation\nKJ\nm]mNIr1NIt]rKJ\nt 5 f JIKNKr . ~19!\nUsing this relation it can be checked that HKK is still gauge\ninvariant, and that\nd~FINIrDxr!5VemnrKI\nmFI\u2018Dxn\u2018Dxr. ~20!\nCombining this with Eq. ~17! shows that HKK is a closed\nform, as desired. Thus, we have a consistent SO(4) invariant\nansatz for Kaluza-Klein reduction of six dimensional gravity\non a sphere, with gauge field vacuum expectation values\n~VEVs!.\nNotice that the three-form HKK is not self-dual. Therefore,\nthis ansatz cannot be given for the minimal N54b theory,\nbut we need at least one tensor multiplet as well. The self-\ndual part of HKK then lives in the gravity multiplet, the anti-\nself-dual part lives in the tensor multiplet. Together, one self-\ndual and one anti-self-dual tensor combine into an\nunconstrained two-form field. We can think of such a two-\nform field as originating in either the Neveu-Schwarz ~NS!\nor Ramond-Ramond ~RR! two-form in type IIB string theory\nin ten dimensions. In particular, for the equations of motion\nwe can use the equations of motion of string theory, rather\nthan the more complicated ones of N54b supergravity.\nEquations of motion. Using the results collected in @10#\nand the above remarks, it is now a straightforward, if\nlengthy, exercise to compute the six-dimensional equations\nof motion for our Kaluza-Klein ansatz. As in @10#, it is easier\nto work out the equations of motion using the vielbein for-\nmalism. It is convenient to display the SO(4)5SU(2)\n3SU(2) gauge symmetry inherited from isometries of the\nsphere explicitly by picking a basis of Killing vectors such\nthat the left (FLi , i51,2,3! and right (FRi8 , i\u2019 5 1,2,3!

Notice that the\nfirst two equations of motion ~25! and ~26! can naturally be\nVIJAY BALASUBRAMANIAN et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW D 64 064011\n064011-4\nobtained from a three-dimensional theory consisting of the\nEinstein-Hilbert term, a Yang-Mills term and a Chern-\nSimons term. The other two equations ~27! and ~28! do not\nhave such a clear interpretation. It has been shown in @11#\nthat consistent Kaluza-Klein reductions with general SO(4)\ngauge fields can be achieved by also turning on scalar fields\nthat parametrize the shape of the compact manifold.\nThus, although the SU(1,1u2)3SU(1,1u2) Chern-Simons\nsupergravity in 3 dimensions has the symmetries of the six-\ndimensional theory reduced on a sphere, our ansatz does not\nproduce this theory. The Chern-Simons formulation of AdS3\nsupergravity has been an important tool in investigations of\nthe AdS-CFT correspondence ~see, e.g., @21,9,25# amongst\nmany other references!. While many of these works relied\nprimarily on symmetries, it remains desirable to explain pre-\ncisely how and whether the six-dimensional, N54b gravity\nreduces to the three-dimensional SU(1,1u2)3SU(1,1u2)\ntheory. Once we include scalars, we can obtain consistent\ntruncations to a three-dimensional action. Although these\ntheories have more than just a Chern-Simons term, at low\nenergies they can be approximated by a Chern-Simons\ntheory\u2014the F2 terms in the action can be ignored at low\nenergy. A more precise argument is given in @26#, where is it\nshown that wave functions in the Yang-Mills Chern-Simons\ntheory can be decomposed in a natural way in a Yang-Mills\npiece and a Chern-Simons piece.\nWe should also comment on the relation between our\nKaluza-Klein ansatz and the results in Sec. 7 of @19#, where\na Chern-Simons like structure is found for the field equations\nfor a certain set of gauge fields. The computation in @19#\ndiffers from ours in several ways. First of all, the gauge\nfields appearing in the three form and the metric of their\nKaluza-Klein ansatz are different. Thus, the dimensionally\nreduced theory has two different \u2018\u2018gauge fields,\u2019\u2019 but only\none gauge invariance. Secondly, they only consider the self-\ndual three-form, whereas our KK ansatz contains both a self-\ndual and an anti-self-dual three-forms. In particular, Eq.\n~152! in @19# depends explicitly on the gauge fields, and is a\nconsequence of the self-duality equation for the three-form.\nIn our case we do not impose such a self-duality relation, and\nas a consequence, we do not find a field equation of the form\n~152!. The field equation ~27! is not obtained in @19#, because\nthey only consider the linearized system.\nThe results of @19# were extended in @27# where not only\nquadratic but also cubic couplings in the six-dimensional\ntheory were considered. It was found that, to that order, there\nexists a gauge field whose field equation becomes the Chern-\nSimons field equation and that massive fields can be consis-\ntently put to zero. The gauge field in question is a linear\ncombination of the gauge fields appearing in the metric and\nin a self-dual two-form. If we were to insist that our three-\nform is self-dual, we would also find the Chern-Simons field\nequation, and in this sense the results agree with each other.\nSummary. We have found an SO(4) invariant Kaluza-\nKlein ansatz for the S3 compactification of six dimensional\nsupergravity, involving just the KK gauge fields and no sca-\nlars. Upon dimensional reduction, however, we do not find\nequations of motion that could arise from a three dimen-\nsional effective action. In any case, if F50, our ansatz for\nthe metric and HKK provide solutions to the 6D equations of\nmotion. The effective 3-dimensional equations are solved by\nany solution to three dimensional cosmological gravity with\na flat gauge field. This spectrum of solutions includes the\nsupersymmetric conical defects we are interested in. Below\nwe will show how the gauge fields are chosen to make the\nsolutions supersymmetric.\nB. Supersymmetry\nHaving found an appropriate Kaluza-Klein ansatz, we in-\nvestigate the supersymmetry of the solutions incorporating\nconical defects. By examining the Killing spinor equations,\nwith a flat KK gauge field, we recognize the effective 3D\nequations as the Killing spinor equations of the SU(1,1u2)\n3SU(1,1u2) Chern-Simons supergravity. This allows us to\nuse the work of @8,9# to choose a Wilson line for which the\n3D conical defects lift to supersymmetric solutions of the\nsix-dimensional theory.\n1. 6D Killing spinor equations\nFirst, the 10D type IIB supergravity has 32 supersymme-\ntries. Half of them are broken by the reduction on K3, so we\nare left with 16 supersymmetries in six dimensions. The re-\nsulting theory is the N54b supergravity in six dimensions.\nAs long as we consider flat gauge fields, the three-form is\nself-dual, and we can ignore the tensor multiplets. N54b\nsupergravity is a chiral theory, with four chiral, symplectic-\nMajorana supercharges ~labeled by r51, . . . 4), each having\nfour real components. Following Romans @18#, the N54b\nalgebra can be viewed as an extension of an N52 algebra.\nThe N52 algebra is generated by a doublet of chiral spino-\nrial charges, and it has an USp(2)5SU(2) R-symmetry. The\ncharges are doublets under the SU(2). The N54b algebra\ncan be viewed as an extension of N52 to N54, where one\ntakes two copies of the N52 charges of the same chirality.\nThe resulting algebra has an USp(4)5Spin(5) R-symmetry,\nand the four supersymmetry parameters er transform in the\nfundamental representation of Spin(5).\nSpin(5) is represented by the 434 Gamma matrices G i:\n$Gk,G l%5dkl, k ,l51, . . . ,5. ~31!\nG5 has two 11 eigenvalues, and two 21 eigenvalues.\nHence, by taking suitable linear combinations of the super-\nsymmetry parameters er , we can organize things so that\n~G5!rses5H 1er for r51,32er for r52,4. ~32!\nThe 6D Killing spinor equation is\nDMer2\n1\n4 HMNP\nk GNP~Gk!rses50. ~33!\nIn our solutions only one of the five three form fields is\nturned on, and by U-duality, we can choose HMNP\nk ;dk5.\nWhen the field strengths FI vanish, the gauge invariant defi-\nnition of H in Eq. ~18! reduces to Eq. ~15!.

We only\nneed a minor generalization of the solutions of @8# to con-\nstruct solutions for our equations. In this and the following\nsection we will show in detail how to do the embedding. In\nparticular, we are interested in keeping track of the number\nof supersymmetries that are preserved as the conical deficit\nparameter increases from 0 to its extreme value.\nExtended AdS3 supergravity theories were first con-\nstructed based on the Osp(pu2,R) ^ OSp(qu2,R) super-\ngroups @22#, and are referred to as (p ,q) supergravities. The\nnumber of supercharges is N5p1q , and each of them is a\ntwo-component real spinor. The action also contains O(p)\n3O(q) gauge fields. Izquierdo and Townsend @8# embedded\nthe 3D conical defects into ~2,0! supergravity and investi-\ngated their supersymmetry. In @8#, the two-component real\nspinors have been combined into a single complex spinor, so\nthe O(2) gauge group has been interpreted as a U(1). Then\nthere is a single complex vector-spinor gravitino field, with a\nsupersymmetry transformation parametrized by a single\ncomplex two-component spinor parameter.

Note that Izquierdo and Townsend\nfind Killing spinors for arbitrary g ,n . Apparently this leads\nto BPS solutions of arbitrarily negative mass. We will com-\nment briefly on their meaning in Sec.

For s,0 the spinor is singular.\nWhen n50, 0,ugu,1, corresponding to the conical de-\nfects, s50 in Eq. ~68! but n50, the Killing spinors are\nperiodic, and, since we are working in a polar frame, singular\nat the origin. However, the origin is in any case a singular\npoint, and removed from the spacetime. That is to say, the\nspacetime has noncontractible loops so Q\u00de0 is possible.\nThere are then two Killing spinors.\nLet us consider the case of global AdS 3 in greater detail.\nAdS 3 in global coordinates with zero gauge fields is ob-\ntained when g52n561. In this case, the origin becomes\nregular. The corresponding Killing spinors have s50 and\nare regular at the origin, as required.

Since both these choices give the AdS 3 geometry, we\nsee it has four Killing spinors, that is, it preserves the full\nsupersymmetry of (2,0) supergravity.\nWhat is the relation between global AdS3 and the conical\ndefects with Wilson lines?

The limit g561, n50 corresponds to\nAdS 3 with non-zero gauge fields of charge Q57 12 . Now\nnote that the integer n can be changed by a large gauge\ntransformation @8# ~from the six-dimensional point of view,\nthis corresponds to a coordinate transformation on S3; see\nSec.

For g561, we can make a gauge transfor-\nmation to make n571; this turns the periodic spinors asso-\nciated with the point particle geometries into the antiperiodic\nspinors associated with AdS 3. Again, AdS 3 has twice as\nmany supersymmetries, because there are two ways to reach\nthe AdS 3 limit.\n4. Embedding into 6D N\u02dc4b supergravity\nIt is quite simple to promote Izquierdo\u2019s and Townsend\u2019s\nsolutions for (2,0) Killing spinors to solutions of the Killing\nspinor Eqs. ~54!, ~55!.

Note that the complex\nconjugate structure is consistent with the s3 having opposite\nsign diagonal entries. Note also that the number of Killing\nspinors is doubled in each sector, because of the label r.\nSimilar manipulations are done on the SU(2)R sector.\nHowever, there is a subtlety when the L and R sector Killing\nspinor equations are combined. The two sectors each have\ntheir own SU(2) gauge fields A ,A8 and Killing spinor equa-\ntions ~54!, ~55!. For the charged point mass spacetimes, the\ntwo background gauge fields need not be equal.

CONICAL DEFECTS FROM THE SPINNING BLACK\nSTRING\nIn the previous section, we saw how the three-\ndimensional solutions in which we are interested arose by\nspontaneous compactification of the six-dimensional N\n54b theory. Interest in the six-dimensional theory is often\nfocused on its black string solutions, so we would like to see\nif we can relate the point particles to these black strings. The\npresence of non-trivial Kaluza-Klein gauge fields in the su-\npersymmetric point particle solutions suggests we should\nconsider a rotating black string, as the gauge field arises from\noff-diagonal components of the higher-dimensional metric\nand B-field, which we would associate with rotation.\nThe solution describing a non-extremal spinning black\nstring in six dimensions is @29,30#5\n5Notice that in @29#, there is also a nontrivial three-form field in\nthe solution. We expect that this three-form reduces, in the near-\nhorizon limit, to our KK ansatz for the three-form, but we have not\nchecked this explicitly.\nSUPERSYMMETRIC CONICAL EFFECTS: TOWARDS A . . .

Properties of the solution: Instabilities and singularities\nFrom the three-dimensional point of view, there is a coni-\ncal singularity at r50, for both the non-rotating BTZ black\nholes and for the point particle spacetimes. In the full six-\ndimensional solution, we need to check the nature of this\nsingularity. The curvature invariants are everywhere finite, so\nthere is no curvature singularity. Consider a small neighbor-\nhood of the point r50, u50 in a constant time slice. The\nmetric near this point can be approximated by\nds2\u2019\ndr2\ng2\n1r2dw21du21df21u2~dc1gdw!2.\n~108!\nThis suggests a further coordinate transformation\nr5gRcosu ,u5Rsinu , ~109!\nwhich brings the metric to the form\nds2\u2019dR21R2@du21g2cos2udw21sin2u~dc1gdw!2# .\n~110!\nThus, the area of a surface at e proper distance from the\npoint r50,u50 is e3g2p2. The difference between this area\nand the standard S3 area e32p2 indicates that there is a coni-\ncal defect at this point. Note that the choices of parameters\nfor which we get negative M 3, and hence a point particle\nsolution, are precisely those for which the full six-\ndimensional solution does not have an event horizon. Hence\nthis is a naked conical singularity.\nFor a given value of a1, we can obtain point particle so-\nlutions with all values of M 3 by varying Ry . There is no\nobvious bound associated with the value M 3521 corre-\nsponding to pure AdS space. It was already noted by Iz-\nquierdo and Townsend in @8# that there exist supersymmetric\nsolutions to 3D gravity for arbitrarily negative values of M 3.\nThese solutions are all singular, and the singularities which\noccur for M 3,21 are not essentially different from those\nwhich occur for M 3.21. From a three-dimensional point of\nview, one simply asserts that while the singular solutions\nwith M 3.21 are physically relevant, as they can arise from\nthe collapse of matter, those with M 3,21 are physically\nirrelevant. We similarly expect that only the solutions with\nM 3.21 will have a physical interpretation in the dual CFT,\nas AdS space corresponds to the NS vacuum of the CFT, and\nwe do not expect to find excitations with lower energy. It is\ntherefore surprising that the six-dimensional string metric\nmakes no distinction between M 3,21 and M 3.21. It is\nclear that it does not, as the nature of the singularity in the\nsix-dimensional solution is independent of the value of Ry .\nHowever, we should still ask whether this solution is\nstable for all values of Ry . In @32#, it was argued the BTZ\nVIJAY BALASUBRAMANIAN et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW D 64 064011\n064011-12\n3S3 solution ~for all masses! would be stable against local-\nization on S3 so long as global AdS3 did not appear in the\nspectrum of the compactified string. Here we have argued\nthat for certain parameters, the rotating, compactified string\ndoes include global AdS3. Therefore, it is doubly worthwhile\nto consider the question of instabilities for near-extremal so-\nlutions with angular momentum.8\nIn fact, the full asymptotically flat rotating black string\nsolution has a more familiar instability: localization on the\ncircle (y) along which the string is compactified. Such an\ninstability typically sets in when the entropy of the localized\nsolution is greater than that of the extended one @33#. Since\nthe present solution carries a charge, a simple model for the\nlocalized solution is the extreme black string carrying the\nsame charge, along with a six-dimensional Schwarzschild\nblack hole carrying the energy above extremality of the\noriginal solution. Consider, for definiteness, the non-extremal\nsolutions discussed above, with d050, l250. From Eq.\n~80!, M2M ext\u2019mRy for near-extremal solutions, so the en-\ntropy of the Schwarzschild black hole in the candidate local-\nized solution is\nSBH;~mRy!4\/3. ~111!\nThus, for Ry.Rcrit , we expect the solution to be unstable,\nwhere Rcrit is given by SBS5SBH . That is,\nRcrit\n2\/3 ;\nQ1Q2~2m2l12!\nm8\/3\n~112!\nfor near-extremal solutions. Thus, as we approach extremal-\nity, Rcrit may grow, but it will eventually decline and reach\nzero at m5l1\n2\/2. For fixed Ry , all the near-extremal solutions\nwith m small enough are unstable to localization.9 This in-\nstability sets in at a finite distance from extremality; so we\nwill always encounter it before reaching the instability to\nlocalization on S3 that is suggested by the physics of the\nnear-horizon limit.\nThere is hence an Ry-dependent instability. Does this al-\nlow us to exclude the undesirable singularities ~those with\nM 3,21)? We have argued for this instability by comparing\nthe entropy of a near-extreme string to that of the extreme\nstring plus a localized black hole. Thus we have assumed\nthat the extreme string, which corresponds to a supersym-\nmetric point particle solutions, is stable, and we cannot use\nthis approach to argue that the extremal solutions are un-\nstable. The assumption of stability of the extremal solutions\nis consistent, since, as we approach extremality, the entropy\ngain in the localization ~111! is going to zero. Furthermore,\nthere is no lower-energy system than the extreme string that\ncarries the same angular momentum and charges. Together\nwith experience in other examples, this suggests the extreme\nstring is stable for all values of Ry , and hence instabilities do\nnot serve to rule out the cases corresponding to M 3,21.\nIV. A PROPOSAL FOR A DUAL DESCRIPTION\nIn @9#, an interpretation of the point mass geometries in\nterms of spectral flow operators was given. Here, we propose\na somewhat different model in terms of density matrices in\nthe RR sector of the boundary CFT. It may seem surprising\nto propose that a gravitational system without a horizon, and\nhence no Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, would be described\nby a density matrix. However, the classical formulas only\nregister a sufficiently large degeneracy. The ensemble of su-\npersymmetric states that we are proposing contains fewer\nstates than the number that enter the ensemble describing the\nM50 black hole. As is well known, the latter system has\nvanishing entropy in the semiclassical limit. Below, we\nbriefly summarize the main idea of our proposal. Details and\nvarious tests will be presented in a future publication @34#.\nAll geometries we have considered are either singular or\nhave a horizon. Once we remove the singular region, we are\nleft with a space with topology R23S1. This is true even for\npure AdS3 with nonzero SU(2) Wilson lines. The singularity\nin those cases is not a curvature singularity, but one where\nthe SU(2) gauge fields are ill-defined. The only exception is\npure AdS3 without Wilson lines, whose topology is that of\nR3. We will first ignore pure AdS3, but as we will see a bit\nlater it fits in quite naturally.\nOn a space with topology R23S1, there are two topologi-\ncal choices for the spin bundle, corresponding to periodic\nand anti-periodic boundary conditions along the S1. By peri-\nodic and anti-periodic we refer to spinors expressed in terms\nof a Cartesian frame on the boundary cylinder, which corre-\nspond to a radial frame in the AdS geometry. Thus, periodic\nboundary conditions correspond to the RR sector, anti-\nperiodic boundary conditions to the NS sector. The proposed\ndual description of the point mass geometries will be valid\nassuming periodic boundary conditions, but as we will see,\none can derive an equivalent description using anti-periodic\nboundary conditions.\nIt may be confusing that we impose periodic boundary\nconditions on the spinor and fermion fields, because if we\nuse the field equations to parallel transport a spinor along the\ncircle, we can pick up arbitrary phases, depending on the\nchoice of point mass geometry, and also on the choice of\nSU(2) Wilson lines. These phases are the holonomies of the\nflat SL(2) and SU(2) connections that define the geometry\nand Wilson lines, but they are still connections on the same\ntopological spinor bundle. In other words, given a bundle\nwith a given topology, there are still many flat connections\non that bundle, which are parametrized by its holonomies. In\nour case we choose the ~periodic! spinor bundle, and view\nthe gauge fields as connections on this bundle. Whether there\nexist global covariantly constant sections of the spinor\nbundle is a question that does depend crucially on the\nchoices of flat connections, and is precisely the question\n8It was argued in @32# that such a localization instability should\nnot occur for the full asymptotically flat black string solutions, as it\nwould break spherical symmetry. In our case, the spherical symme-\ntry is already broken by the rotation; so it is not obvious that this\nargument applies.\n9This is quite different from the usual behavior near extremality:\nfor a non-rotating black string, Rcrit\u2192\u2018 as m\u21920, as we can see\nfrom Eq. ~112! with l150.\nSUPERSYMMETRIC CONICAL EFFECTS: TOWARDS A . . .

First of all, in this\nway l0 and l\u00af0 are spectral flow invariants, and the asymptotic\ndensity of RR states with the quantum numbers ~118!\u2013~121!\nis a function of l0 , l\u00af0 only. This is in nice agreement with the\nfact that the area of the horizon and therefore the entropy of\nBTZ black holes also depends on l0 , l\u00af0 only.\nThe quadratic terms in Eqs. ~120! and ~121! are also natu-\nral if we use the relation between the Hamiltonian reduction\nof SU(1,1u2) current algebra and the boundary superconfor-\nmal algebra @35,23,36,21,37#. The stress tensor obtained in\nthis Hamiltonian reduction procedure contains the Sugawara\nstress tensor of the SU(2),SU(1,1u2) current algebra, and\nthis extra contribution yields the quadratic terms in ~120!,\n~121!.\nSpectral flow in the boundary theory corresponds in the\nbulk to the following procedure. In the bulk, we can remove\npart of the SU(2) Wilson lines by a singular field redefini-\ntion. Namely, if a field c(x) has charge q under the\nU(1),SU(2) subgroup, we can introduce new fields\nc\u02dc ~x !5PexpS qjE\nx0\nx\nA\u0095dx Dc~x ! ~122!\nand at the same time replace the gauge field by\nA\u02dc ~x !5~12j!A~x !. ~123!\nThis is a ~singular! gauge transformation and does not affect\nthe physics. The only consequence of this transformation is\nthat it gives twisted boundary conditions to all fields charged\nunder the U(1).

In\nother words, we can set up the AdS-CFT correspondence\nwith arbitrary twisted boundary conditions. The twisted\nboundary conditions in the bulk match the twisted boundary\nconditions of the CFT, and the relations ~118!\u2013~121! are\nvalid independently of the twist. Spectral flow corresponds to\na field redefinition both in the bulk and in the boundary\ntheory, and does not affect the physics. For other discussions\nof the role of spectral flow, see @39,40,9,37#.\nWe can now understand how pure AdS arises in this pic-\nture. We start with pure AdS with a flat gauge field with\nholonomy 21 in the fundamental representation. According\nto the above proposal, this corresponds to states in the RR\nsector with L05c\/24 and J05c\/12. If we remove the gauge\nfield completely by a field redefinition, this changes the\nboundary conditions of the fermions, and they become anti-\nperiodic instead of periodic. Therefore, the field redefinition\nbrings us from the R to the NS sector. In addition, the quan-\ntum numbers after the field redefinition become L05J050.\nWe see that pure AdS with anti-periodic boundary conditions\n~the only boundary conditions that are well-defined on pure\nAdS! corresponds to the vacuum in the NS sector, as ex-\npected.\nAs a final check of our proposal, we will rederive the\nresults of Izquierdo and Townsend @8# regarding the super-\nsymmetries in point mass geometries with non-trivial gauge\nfields turned on.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\nWe have embedded the 3D BPS conical defects into a\nhigher dimensional supergravity arising from string theory.\nThe defects in three dimensions provide particularly simple\nlaboratories for the AdS-CFT correspondence. They are ex-\namples of systems that are neither perturbations of the AdS\nvacuum, nor semiclassical thermal states like black holes.\nUnderstanding the detailed representation of such objects in\na dual CFT is bound to be instructive. Furthermore, the coni-\ncal defects which we have constructed in six dimensions can\nbe collided to yield the ~near horizon limit! of the classic 5D\nblack holes whose entropy was explained by Strominger and\nVafa @13#.\nTo recap, we have given a detailed analysis of the Kaluza-\nKlein reduction of the N54b chiral supergravity in six di-\nmensions coupled to tensor multiplets. Our KK ansatz gives\nsolutions to the 6D equations of motion which correspond\nfrom the dimensionally reduced point of view to 3D conical\ndefects with Wilson lines. Supersymmetry is preserved by a\njudicious choice of the gauge potential. From the 6D point of\nview, our solutions are spheres fibered over an AdS3 base,\nand the conical defect arises at a point where the fibration\nbreaks down. Although we thereby embed all the solutions of\nthe 3D Chern-Simons supergravities into the six dimensional\ntheory, our ansatz does not in general produce a consistent\ntruncation to a Chern-Simons theory. ~Solutions with F50\nare admitted, but the six dimensional equations of motion do\nnot impose this.!10\nOur solutions can also be understood as near-horizon lim-\nits of rotating string solutions in six dimensions compactified\non a circle. Surprisingly, global AdS33S3 appears in one\ncorner of the parameter space. Although our solutions con-\ntain conical singularities, they remain interesting because we\nexpect them to be resolved by string theory. In particular, we\nhave a proposal for a non-singular dual description in a con-\nformal field theory. If our solutions are admissible, they ap-\npear to imply a Gregory-Laflamme instability for the near-\nextremal rotating black strings.\nWe have suggested a concrete representation of our coni-\ncal defects as ensembles of chiral primaries in a dual CFT.\nSubsequent articles will test our proposal.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe have benefited from conversations with Sander Bais,\nMirjam Cvetic\u02c7, Sumit Das, Robbert Dijkgraaf, Per Kraus,\nDon Marolf, Samir Mathur, Andy Strominger, and Arkady\nTseytlin.

In particular, we show in\ndetail how the 6D spinors can be chosen to be SU(2) dou-\nblets of complex conjugate two-component spinors\n\u00abr5S \u00ab (2)r\u00abr(2)*D . ~A1!\nThe 6D Killing spinor equation in N54b supergravity was\nS DM714 HMNP5 GNPD er50, ~A2!\nwhere the upper ~lower! sign is for r51,3 (r52,4). The\nsupersymmetry parameters er are positive chirality spinors\n10While this paper was in the final stages of preparation we be-\ncame aware that related investigations have been conducted by\nSamir Mathur.\nSUPERSYMMETRIC CONICAL EFFECTS: TOWARDS A . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW D 64 064011\n064011-15\ner5S \u00abr0 D . ~A3!\nEach of the four (r51, . . . ,4) spinors has four complex\ncomponents. That gives 32 real degrees of freedom, of which\nwe must remove half, since the N54b supergravity has only\n16 supersymmetries. This can be done by imposing a reality\ncondition on the chiral spinors. In 6D, the appropriate reality\ncondition is either the SU~2! or the symplectic Majorana\ncondition, depending on the R symmetry of the supersymme-\ntry algebra @41#. It can be consistently imposed along with\nthe chirality projection. Literature on the subject includes\n@41,42,18,19,24#. Here we are mostly following @42#.\nReference @42# first considers N52 susy in 6D. There is\nan SU~2! doublet of four-component complex spinors, satis-\nfying the SU~2!-Majorana condition\n~ca\ni !*[c\u00af a\u02d9 i5e i jBa\u02d9\nb\ncb\nj ~A4!\nwhere i , j51,2 label the doublet and a ,a\u02d9 are spinor indices.\nThe matrix B must satisfy\nBB*5B*B521. ~A5!\nOne can see this by applying the SU~2!-Majorana condition\ntwice and remembering that e2152e12521.\nFor N54 supersymmetry, we have four complex four-\ncomponent spinors, transforming as a fundamental of the\nUSp~4! R-symmetry group. The four-component spinors can\nbe understood as chiral 8-component complex spinors, with\n4 components projected out by the chirality projection. Now\nthe SU~2!-Majorana condition is promoted to a symplectic\nMajorana condition\nC\u00af ra\u02d9 5VrsBa\u02d9\nb\nCsb ~A6!\nwhere Vrs is the symplectic metric of the USp~4! group, and\na\u02d9 ,b label the 8 components of the spinor. B is a 434 matrix\nsatisfying Eq. ~A5!. The symplectic metric is\nV5S 0 1\u00c01 0D . ~A7!\nLet us take the spinors Cr to be the chiral 8-component\nspinors er . Recall that we have chosen the spinors er with\nr51,3 to have opposite G5 eigenvalues from r52,4. In this\nchoice, we have ensured that the symplectic metric will not\nmix spinors with opposite eigenvalues.\nFor the supersymmetry parameters, the symplectic Majo-\nrana condition ~A6! becomes\ne\u00af 1\nT5Be3 , ~A8!\nand similarly for e\u00af 2 ,e4. The left hand side of Eq. ~A8! is\ne\u00af 1\nT5~e1\n\u2020G0!\nT\n5S 0 1 ^ g0,T1 ^ g0,T 0 D S \u00ab1*0 D\n5S 0\n2~1 ^ g0!\u00ab1*\nD , ~A9!\nwhere in the last line we used g0,T52g0 ~recall that g05\n2is2).\nTo evaluate the right hand side of Eq. ~A8!, we need the\nmatrix B. We can assume it to be real, and of the form\nB5S B\u02c6\nB\u02c6\nD , ~A10!\nwhere B\u02c6 is real 434-matrix satisfying B\u02c6 2521. A conve-\nnient choice turns out to be\nB\u02c6 5s1 ^ g0. ~A11!\nThe right hand side of Eq. ~A8! becomes\nBe35S 0B\u02c6 \u00ab3D . ~A12!\nThus Eq. ~A8! reduces to the equation\n2~1 ^ g0!\u00ab1*5B\u02c6 \u00ab35~s1 ^ g0!\u00ab3 . ~A13!\nNext, introduce the notation\n\u00abr5S xrjr D , r51,3 ~A14!\nwhere xr ,jr are 2-component complex spinors. Then Eq.\n~A13! is equivalent to\nS 2g0x1*\n2g0j1*\nD 5S g0j3g0x3D . ~A15!\nThus the two 4-component spinors \u00ab1,3 are\n\u00ab15S x1j1D ; \u00ab352S j1*x1*D . ~A16!\nOut of the 8 complex degrees of freedom, only 4 remain.\nSince the Killing spinor equations are linear, we can take\nlinear combinations of \u00ab1 ,\u00ab3:\n\u00ab\u02dc 15\u00ab12\u00ab3\n\u00ab\u02dc 35i~\u00ab11\u00ab3!. ~A17!\nThen, the \u00ab\u02dc r are of the complex conjugate doublet form\n~A1!. The corresponding 8-component spinors are\nVIJAY BALASUBRAMANIAN et al.

We can then drop the tildes, and\nassume that in the Killing spinor calculation the 6D spinors\nare such that the resulting 3D spinors will be of the form\n~A1!.\nAPPENDIX B: THE 3-SPHERE\nThe 3-sphere of radius l is explicitly described as\nl25x1\n21x2\n21x3\n21x4\n2\n, ~B1!\nds25dx1\n21dx2\n21dx3\n21dx4\n2\n. ~B2!\nOne solution to the constraint is\nx15l cos u , ~B3!\nx25l sin u cos f , ~B4!\nx35l sin u sin f cos c , ~B5!\nx45l sin u sin f sin c , ~B6!\nwhich gives the metric\nds25l2~du21su\n2df21su\n2sf\n2 dc2!. ~B7!\n~We are using the notation su[sinu and cu[cosu.!

Then the sphere can\nalso be written as\nds25dz1dz\u00af11dz2dz\u00af2; l25z1z\u00af11z2z\u00af2 . ~B8!\nLet us parametrize solutions to these equations as\nz15l cos~u\/2!ei(f1c)\/2, ~B9!\nz25l sin~u\/2!ei(f2c)\/2. ~B10!\n~Note that exchanging f\u2194c complex conjugates z2.!
