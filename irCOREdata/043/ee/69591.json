Whilst the experience incorporates a variety of \nfeatures, those most commonly reported are: a floating sensation, seeing the physical \nbody from a remote point in space, and the impression of travelling to distant \nlocations (Alvarado, 2000). Prevalence in the general population is widely considered \nto be between 10-12% (Alvarado, op cit), rising to about 25% in student populations \n(Gow, Lang & Chant, 2004), and 82% in those with a strong interest in the \nparanormal (Alvarado & Zingrone, 1999). The OBE tends to be a phenomenon that \nthe person will experience more than once. Murray and Fox (2005) found that 79% of \ntheir OBE respondents experienced at least two OBEs, 39% at least five, and 17% had \nexperienced more than 10. \nPrevious research has aimed to \u201eprofile\u201f people who have OBEs; in order to \ndescribe their personality, or to predict what kind of personality would be most likely \nto have an OBE. People who have had out-of body experiences (OBErs) do score \nhigher on measures of dissociation, especially somatoform dissociation (Irwin, 2000, \nMurray & Fox, 2005), fantasy proneness (Gow et al., 2004), paranormal belief \n(Tobacyk & Mitchell, 1987), and display a propensity to become more \npsychologically absorbed (Myers, Austrin, Grisso & Nickeson, 1983) than their non-\nOBE counterparts.  \nA considerable body of psychological research has been conducted with the \ntheoretical assumption that the OBE is some form of hallucination (Blackmore, 1984) \nand that it may be linked to mental health disorders, such as depersonalisation \n 3 \n(Whitlock, 1978) or schizophrenia (Rawcliffe, 1959). However, there appears to be no \nevidence linking OBEs to psychosis (McCreery & Claridge, 1995) depersonalisation \n(Twemlow, 1989) or schizophrenic body boundary disturbances (Blackmore, 1986a).  \nOne personality variable that has received considerable research attention is that of \nschizotypy, in particular the fully dimensional model proposed by Claridge (1997). \nThis model portrays schizotypy as a psychological concept which encompasses a \nrange of personality traits related to psychosis and schizophrenia, varying over a \nnormally distributed continuum from psychological good health to psychological ill \nhealth (Goulding, 2004). This is distinctly different to the categorical view of the \nsame illnesses, where someone either has the illness, or does not. Schizophrenia and \npsychosis, on the other hand, are considered to be breaks in normal psychological \nfunctioning, which make up a second continuum, with schizotypal personality \ndisorder at one end and advanced schizophrenic psychosis at the other (Claridge, \n1997). Claridge\u201fs model effectively decouples the concept of schizotypy from that of \nmental illness whilst still allowing for certain aspects of schizotypy, particularly at the \nhigher end of the spectrum, to be causally linked to such illnesses (McCreery & \nClaridge, 1995).  \nClaridge\u201fs model comprises four factors, 1) aberrant perceptions and beliefs (sub-\nclinical forms of positive symptomatology), 2) cognitive disorganisation with anxiety \n(sub-clinical forms of thought blocking and high social anxiety), 3) introvertive \nanhedonia (sub-clinical forms of the negative symptomatology of schizophrenia), and \n4) asocial behaviour, such as social non-conformity, impulsiveness and disinhibition \nof mood.  \nEvidence from research into this model suggests that schizotypy, although \nassociated with psychopathology, may also have an adaptive value, particularly where \n 4 \nanomalous experiences are concerned (McCreery & Claridge, 2002). For instance, \nMcCreery and Claridge (1995) found that OBErs scored higher on the positive factor \nof aberrant perceptions and beliefs than non-OBErs, moderately on neuroticism, and \nlow on physical anhedonia and social anxiety. In another study (McCreery & \nClaridge, 2002) the same authors found that the only discriminating factor between \nOBErs and non-OBErs was the aberrant perceptions and beliefs factor.  \nResearch on schizotypy has been extended to other anomalous experiences, some \nof which have been linked with OBEs.  In a review of the literature, Goulding (2005) \nlisted 18 studies conducted over a 25 year period that showed people who were \nbelievers in, or who claimed to have experienced, paranormal phenomena also scored \nhigh on measures of schizotypy. Goulding\u201fs research adds support to McCreery and \nClaridge\u201fs (2002) view of the healthy schizotype, which they define as people who \nare fully functional in everyday life \u201cin spite of, and even in part because of, their \nanomalous perceptual and other experiences\u201d (p.141).  \nA criticism of much of the previous work on the OBE is that it takes a largely \u201etop-\ndown\u201f approach rather than first eliciting such experiences in detail before forming \ntestable hypotheses which would provide the best psychological insight into the \nphenomenon (Alvarado 1997). In particular, Alvarado and Zingrone (2003) have been \ncritical of the lack of systematic work conducted to elicit the impact the OBE has on \nthe experient. In so doing, research in this area has tended to overlook the relevance \nor the significance of the experience for the person having it. \nWhile this previous work has added substantially to our understanding of the OBE, \nthere is a need for an examination of the longitudinal after-effects experienced by \npeople who have them, and the nature of those after-effects. To date there has been no \nin-depth examination of the lived experience of having an OBE and what meaning \n 5 \nOBErs attribute to that experience. Such work would be expected to contribute to an \nunderstanding of how anomalous experience (or aberrant perceptions) may contribute \nto, or impact upon the mental well-being of such persons. The present research aimed \nto address these issues. \n \nMethod \nStudy Design \nA qualitative, phenomenological approach, that of Interpretative Phenomenological \nAnalysis (IPA) (Smith, 1996), was adopted which enabled an in-depth analysis of, \nand engagement with, individual accounts of OBEs. This was achieved through the \nuse of face-to-face, semi-structured interviews. The use of IPA to study the OBE here \nis focussed upon the interpretation and meaning of such experiences, drawing out the \nimplications for mental health issues. It makes no claim, nor do we have an interest \nhere, with regards to whether these experiences are of 'real' veridical events.  \n \nSample \nSampling in IPA research is purposive; that is, it seeks the experiences and opinions \nof the most appropriate persons for the particular research issue being addressed. \nAlthough, there are various factors that may influence the sample size of a study, \nSmith and Osborn (2008) point out that there is no objectively finite sample size for \nan IPA study. The intense analysis of individual accounts and the examination of \nshared meaning, along with any nuances in these meanings, are reflective of the \nidiographic characteristic of IPA which is generally characterized by small and \nhomogeneous samples (Smith, Jarman, & Osborn, 1999). To meet these requirements \nthree participants (two males and one female) were recruited; one participant was \n 6 \nrecruited at a local paranormal annual conference day. The remaining two participants \nwere recruited from a database of respondents who had taken part in previous \nresearch studies and who had given their contact details with the wish to take part in \nfuture research.  \nMark (age 30) estimated he had had between 20 and 50 OBEs. These had begun in \nchildhood. A typical OBE for Mark began when he experienced a variety of physical \nsensations usually beginning with a buzzing or vibration that ran up and down his \nbody; a stage of sleep paralysis followed and a feeling of pressure on his chest area. \nThis was followed by a period of light-headedness before finally he felt he had exited \nhis physical body into the OB environment. His adult OBEs started shortly after the \ndeath of his brother and the most significant content of his OBEs are his self-believed \nevidential communications with his deceased brother. \nCindy (age 45) reported 2 prior OBEs. She described having floating, out-of-body \nsensations when she was a teenager whilst listening to music. She had her first full \nOBE while going to sleep when she was 20 years old, 4-5 weeks post-child birth. \nCindy described the exit from her body as very quick and recalled suddenly finding \nherself looking down on her body as she lay in bed. She described the OB \nenvironment as similar to the physical room she was lying in, except that the walls \nand ceilings were transparent. She then heard a voice telling her to go back as it was \nnot her time yet. She returned to her body quickly and hard. Before waking up she \nthen heard her step-grandfather\u201fs voice telling her not to worry and that the baby was \nnot well. At that point she \u201ewoke up\u201f feeling very frightened. The next day she took \nher baby to the local doctor's surgery and then later to the local hospital, where upon \nthe baby was diagnosed with bronchial pneumonia.  \n 7 \nJohn (age 28) reported 2 prior OBEs. He had been diagnosed with nocturnal \nepilepsy at the age of 10 and received medication to control it. His first OBE \nhappened when he was 17 years old and asleep in his room. He experienced sleep \nparalysis, which he described as \u201cterrifying\u201d. After the paralysis, John went back to \nsleep, then next remembers being out of his body, sitting on top of the bookcase in the \ncorner of his room, looking down on himself as he lay in bed. As he looked back at \nhis physical body the whole room seemed to come towards him and he found himself \nback in his body and awake again.  \n \nInterview Procedure \nA pre-prepared interview schedule contained a list of main topics to be covered, \nincluding biographical details, background to the and full details of the OBE, what \nhappened immediately after, and questions about the person\u201fs life since and any other \nexperiences they may have had. All questions were open-ended; for example, \u201cCan \nyou please tell me about your experience in as much detail as you can remember?\u201d \nInterviews were conducted by the first author and lasted approximately one hour and \nwere audio recorded and fully transcribed. Semi-structured interviews in IPA are \nparticipant led, with the researcher facilitating the interview in a non-directive \nmanner. The attitude of the researcher is one of empathic attentiveness; the \ninterviewer tries to establish a rapport with the participant, ideally based on non-\njudgemental acceptance and openness (Smith & Eatough, 2006). Alongside empathic \nattentiveness, the researcher attempts to retain a critical distance so that they can \nremain aware of interesting and unusual instances in accounts as they happen \u201elive\u201f \n 8 \nand can be subsequently followed up. It was in accordance with these principles that \neach interview was conducted.\n1\n \n \nData Analysis \nIPA was used to analyze the data. This approach has its roots in phenomenological \npsychology, hermeneutics and symbolic interactionism (Smith et al., 1999). It is \nphenomenological in that it seeks to obtain and honour a person\u201fs experiences, \nunderstandings, perceptions and accounts (Reid, Flowers, & Larkin, 2005). There is \nno attempt to construct an objective truth about an experience; rather IPA is more \nconcerned with the subjective account and meaning of the experience (Brocki & \nWearden, 2006). However, IPA acknowledges that, in attempting to gain access to \nanother\u201fs world that \u201caccess depends on and is complicated by the researcher\u201fs own \nconceptions...required in order to make sense of that other personal world through a \nprocess of interpretative activity\u201d (Smith, Jarman, & Osborn, 1999, p. 218-219). \nInherent in the above is the idea that people are social beings and engage in meaning \nmaking in social contexts and interactions. IPA thus draws upon a symbolic \ninteractionist perspective to emphasize that the meanings that individual\u201fs attribute to \nexperiences, events or objects are primarily the result of the process of sense-making \nbetween actors in a social world. In acknowledging this social interaction in the \n                                               \n1\n One possible critique of qualitative research is the effect of the researcher on collected data, in \nparticular, the interactional process occurring during the interviews, which may have unduly shaped \nand given rise to particular responses given by participants. Wooffitt and Widdicombe (2006) highlight \nIPA as a particular approach which does not fully consider the manner in which the utterances of the \ninterviewer give rise to particular responses from participants. The manner by which a person\u201fs \nutterances can be shaped by the design of another person\u201fs preceding utterance has been a particular \nfocus of another qualitative approach, conversation analysis (Hutchby & Wooffitt, 1998), which shows \nthat turns at talk are invariably connected in significant ways to prior turns, with turns in interaction \nbeing designed with respect to the activities performed by prior turns. However, in accordance with the \ntheoretical interest of IPA, which builds up a phenomenological understanding of participants' \nexperiences, analysis emerges as a consequence of data provided in depth over the course of \ninterviews, and the research presented here has therefore focused on the interactional turns of the \ninterviewee. \n 9 \nformation of meaning, IPA also recognizes that a participant\u201fs interpretation of an \nexperience is not always idiosyncratic but grounded, at least in part, in a shared \npsycho-social space between social actors.  \nIPA deals exclusively with text, so the starting point for an IPA analyst is with the \nproduction of a full verbatim transcript of each interview, complete with participants \nanswers and interviewer\u201fs questions (Smith & Osborn, 2008). As IPA is essentially a \nsemantic level analysis, it is not necessary or usual to transcribe the more prosodic \nfeatures of talk. \nSmith and Osborn (op cit) stipulate that IPA takes a \u201enon-prescriptive\u201f approach to \ndata treatment and encourage researcher\u201fs to remain creative wherever possible when \nengaging with data. Nevertheless, there are numerous, detailed worked examples of \nIPA (e.g. Smith & Eatough, 2006) that guide the researcher through four distinct \nstages in the analysis process (Willig, 2001). \nThe first stage involves the researcher immersing themselves with the data and will \nbe familiar to most qualitative researchers, but from a more phenomenological point \nof view, the researcher is actively encouraged to try and \u201ewalk in the shoes\u201f of the \nparticipant as much as possible in order to get a rich flavour of what their world is \nlike. The researcher makes notes about how they perceive the participant makes sense \nof their world, while at the same time noting the course of their own sense-making. \nTraditionally in IPA, these notes are usually a mix of the researcher\u201fs own words and \nphrases culled verbatim from the transcript text, which serves to keep the analysis \ngrounded in the data. \nThe second stage involves taking the researcher\u201fs preliminary notes and \ntransforming them into specific themes, usually in terms of psychological language \n 10 \nand terminology. In stage three, the researcher looks for common \u201ereference points\u201f \n(Willig, op cit) between the themes and a process of clustering the themes begins.  \nIn the fourth and final stage, a summary table of clusters and themes is produced, \nwhich should provide a clear overview of how the clusters and themes fit together as a \ncoherent analysis. This table is usually augmented with keywords (Willig, op cit) and \na line\/page number reference and textual extract to support each theme and to ensure \nthat an \u201eaudit trail\u201f can be traced back to the raw data (Smith & Osborn, 2008).  \nIn the case of small samples, once this process has been exhausted on the first case, \nthe procedure is repeated for all other cases in the sample. When all cases have been \nanalysed, cross case comparisons can then be made (Smith & Osborn, op cit). \n \nReliability and Validity \nGiven the different epistemological basis, aims and objectives of quantitative and \nqualitative research paradigms, achieving adequate reliability and validity in research \nfor each are judged in different ways (Smith, 1996). Here, a number of appropriate \nprocedures were adopted. First, the authors met frequently to compare their \nindependent analyses of the transcripts. These analytical comparisons enabled a check \non the validity of the primary researcher\u201fs analysis and interpretation of participants\u201f \naccounts.  However, the aim of this process is to ensure the credibility of the analysis \nrather than to produce an analysis which is objectively \u201etrue\u201f (Yardley, 2008).  Two \nfurther criteria to assess the internal validity and reliability of qualitative research are \nwhether the argument presented within a study is internally consistent and supported \nby the data, and there being sufficient data from participants discourse within a report \nto enable readers to evaluate the interpretation (Smith, 1996). Therefore, the emergent \n 11 \nthemes presented here are appropriately supported by participants\u201f actual transcribed \nspeech. \n \nResults \nThree interconnected themes emerged when considering participants\u201f OBEs. \n(1) barriers and facilitators to sharing the experience: negative and supportive \nreactions;  \n(2) recovery, rescue and consequence: the positive effects of OBEs; \n(3) the OBE within a biographical context: an adjunct to personal growth and \nunderstanding.  \nEach theme will be discussed in turn and illustrated by direct quotations from the \ntranscripts. Ellipsis points denote a short pause in the flow of a participant\u201fs speech. \n \nBarriers and facilitators to sharing the experience: negative and supportive \nreactions \nBoth Mark and Cindy had a strong desire to share their OBEs with others as part of an \nattempt to better understand them. They had both encountered mixed reactions from \nwithin and outside of their family circle. By contrast, John had not tried to talk in \ndetail about the OB aspect of his experiences as he was concerned that this might \nprovoke derision from others. Instead he had preferred to talk about the sleep \nparalysis aspect of the experience which frightened and confused him, as he had \nthought it might indicate the recurrence of his epilepsy, despite taking medication to \ncontrol it. Mark described his parents\u201f initial reaction to hearing what he had to tell \nthem about his first frightening OBE:  \n \n 12 \nI just explained to her [his mother] what I\u201fd seen and me parents\u2026they just \nlistened to what I had to say and then they just\u2026parents tend to dismiss things, \nand\u2026they just put it down to dreams- a dream experience, so, you\u201fve had a bad \ndream or nightmare, erm, and then when you\u201fre that age as well you tend to \naccept that. \n \nThe early dismissiveness Mark experienced from his parents helped galvanize a long-\nterm personal inhibition about talking to others about any kind of experience which \nmight be perceived as out of the ordinary. This inhibition may have contributed to his \nself-declared reduced social skills and strategies in later life, particularly in regards to \nknowing when, how, and with whom to broach these topics. Diminished opportunities \nto talk about these personally significant experiences left him with long-term feelings \nof being undervalued, powerlessness, frustration and isolation, which had been \ncompounded by the negative reactions he had received when he had tried to discuss \nhis experiences within a workplace setting:  \n \nI\u201fve found that, I think I made a mistake sometime by discussin\u201f it in, perhaps in \nthe workplace\u2026People just tend to dismiss it an\u201f go, what are y\u201fon about, \ny\u201fknow\u2026its probably because the\u201f don\u201ft really, the\u201f not really interested\u2026so they \njust tend to sort of dismiss it y\u201fsee. But like I say, I don\u201ft think it\u201fs, the workplace \nis the right place to discuss it\u2026it\u201fs quite, er, a clumsy thing to do really. \n \nIn contrast, John had never really spoken in depth to anyone else about the OB aspect \nof his experience, although he felt that he wanted to. Although he had a desire to talk \nabout what he had experienced, like Mark, he felt inhibited. However, John\u201fs \ninhibition was made in anticipation of negative reactions from others:  \n \n 13 \nIt\u201fs the sort of thing I would want to share, but I\u201fd only tell select people that, \ny\u201fknow, that I could trust, they wouldn\u201ft laugh at me and that sort of thing. \n \nAll three participants had received support from a variety of sources since having \ntheir first OBEs, which had been crucial in helping them to integrate the experience. \nMark\u201fs already close relationship with his mother became stronger following the \ndeath of his brother. His accounts of his OBEs, in which he described being visited by \nhis deceased brother, were a source of comfort and healing for them and their family:  \n \nIt has a kind of positive uplifting effect on me mum and I feel a lot happier, in \nlife\u2026it\u201fs just a, an inner sense of peace within myself that I know me brother\u201fs \nspoken to me an\u201f I\u201fve seen him and I feel real happy about that\u2026and I think been \nable to share that with me mum as well, erm, is, is really good, an\u201f other members \nof me family. \n \nOutside of the family, Mark had found support and acceptance for his experiences and \nbeliefs at a local paranormal investigation group, which he joined shortly after the \ndeath of his brother:  \n \nI don\u201ft expect the group to just believe what I say\u2026and I don\u201ft enforce me beliefs \non anybody else erm, it\u201fs entirely up to anybody else whether they believe me or \nnot\u2026It\u201fs just that I feel that I want to share the experiences with other people an\u201f \nsee what their views and opinions are. \n \nThe sharing and accepting process within his family and with his peers at the \nparanormal group had helped reduce the early apprehension he had felt about his \nOBEs. Beyond being a source of comfort for himself and his mother, there was a \n 14 \nwider social implication in that he felt more confident and independent and enjoyed \nbeing a part of something to which he had something to contribute. This had raised his \nself-esteem, provided him with a wider social network and given him a definite sense \nof being more in control of his life.  \nHowever, Cindy differed from Mark and John in that she felt less inhibited about \ntalking about her experiences and less concerned about potential negative reactions to \nher story. She attributed this confidence and certainty to the felt realism of her \nexperience itself as it in some way given her a glimpse of life after death: \n \nIt\u201fs convinced me so much, no one will tell me anything different that the-, as far \nas I\u201fm concerned there\u201fs another side and that is it\u2026I\u201fm a hundred percent about \nthat. \n \nRecovery, rescue and consequence: the positive effects of OBEs \nEach participant spoke resolutely for the positive effects the experience brought to \ntheir lives. For Mark, this was a story of recovery and healing after tragedy. The \nsudden tragic death of his brother in a car accident had a profoundly upsetting effect \nupon him and his family. Shortly after his brother\u201fs death Mark began having his \nOBEs in which he felt able to communicate with his deceased brother within the OB \nstate. For him, this had provided proof that his brother was happy, having 'crossed \nover'. Communicating this to his mother and other family members, who accepted \nMark\u201fs experiences as \u201ereal\u201f, had in turn aided his family\u201fs healing. Therefore, an \ninitially frightening experience became transformed and imbued with positive \nmeaning and purpose. Mark felt that, notwithstanding the relatively recent loss of his \nbrother, life had become better, and this he partly attributed to the after effects of \n 15 \nhaving his OBEs. He considered himself to be happier and to have benefited from the \nexperiences.  \nCindy\u201fs story was also one of recovery and healing for her and of rescue for her \nnewly born baby. From a very early age Cindy was extremely afraid of death, in \nparticular she feared her grandparents dying as she had a close relationship with them. \nThis fear was characterized in later life by refusing to attend her grandfather\u201fs funeral:  \n \nI don\u201ft think I fear death\u2026like, erm, when you are [a] young child and you hear \nthe word death it sort of fills you with absolute dread\u2026y\u201fknow, when my \ngranddad died, y\u201fknow, I was pregnant at the time, I didn\u201ft, y\u201fknow, want to go \nand visit him because I didn\u201ft want to see someone on their death bed and there \nwas seeing him in the coffin and things like, that because I was so scared of death, \nso, but I\u201fve, obviously, because of these things that have happened I\u201fm the \ncomplete opposite end now. \n \nCindy also firmly believed that there was an immediate positive outcome to the OBE \nshe had as it saved her baby's life:  \n \nI just understood that this presence was there and it was there to sort of look after, \nlike me and the baby\u2026I think it was a positive experience for me. Without that \nthe chances are, y\u201fknow, my son might\u201fve died. \n \nJohn was somewhat different in that the OB aspect had had a milder positive effect \nthan it did for Mark and Cindy. Rather, it was his fear of an aspect of his OBE \u2013 the \nparalysis which preceded the OBE \u2013 and its immediate association with a potential \nreturn of his epilepsy, which caused him most concern. Having now accepted and \n 16 \novercome this fearful aspect of the experience, John was convinced that as whole it \nwas a positive one, which he would like to repeat:  \n \nIf I had the chance to do it again, I would, knowing that it was safe, y\u201fknow, if \nyou could get it controlled or whatever, it doesn\u201ft scare me, the paralysis thing \nscared me\u2026so, hey, I\u201fd love to able to just turn it on, on and off, it would be \ngreat. \n \nThe OBE within a biographical context: an adjunct to personal growth and \nunderstanding \nJohn felt there had been little in the way of significant changes in his life since his \nfirst experience. The initial shock of the sleep paralysis preceding his OBE seemed to \nhave overshadowed the OB aspect itself, which appeared to have been more quietly \nintegrated and John made his own suggestions as to why this might be the case:  \n \nI think maybe that\u201fs why I\u201fm not, it\u201fs not made such a big impact \u201ecos I know \nother people that\u201fs been sleepy, y\u201fknow, there is a buzz word to describe sleep \nparalysis\u2026 so I think, maybe if it was, if someone had said sleep paralysis is a \nparanormal event that happens because of this, that and the other, then it would \nhave had more of a, an impact. \n \nThe OBE is often viewed as a paranormal event by many lay people and some \nprofessionals. This is partly because of the implication within its name that something \ndetaches itself (e.g. the mind, or consciousness) and travels beyond the confines of the \nphysical body. In this study, both John and Mark shared the same view about the \n\u201eparanormality\u201f of their OBEs. Both had prior knowledge of the paranormal and of \nOBEs, yet both suggested that, having experienced them, they saw them as naturally \n 17 \noccurring events in their lives, something which they both viewed as positive life-\naffirming experiences. In this extract, Mark not only highlights the normality of the \nexperience, but also minimizes the difference between himself as an OBEr and other \npeople who may not have had OBEs:  \n \nIt feels like it\u201fs a naturally occurring experience that are a part of life, and \npersonally I believe that they\u201fve always been there, an, and I don\u201ft believe that \nI\u201fm special in the way that it only happens to me, I just, I genuinely believe that \nthis is the case for all human beings. \n \nSince his experiences, Mark had developed an open-minded view towards anomalous \nexperiences and paranormal phenomena. He placed his faith in scientific research to \nfind out the answers to the questions he had about his own, and other experiences. His \nexperiences had been catalytic in fuelling his desire to find out more about what his \nexperiences are and how they come about. Since the onset of his OBEs, he had begun \na distance learning course about how to scientifically research the paranormal, \nincluding OBEs. An important consideration for Mark when he was seeking out a \nprogramme of study was that the course should not be purely academic, but also \nincorporate the personal experiences of the student, thus allowing him freedom of \nexpression and a chance to evaluate his experiences alongside known scientific data \nabout OBEs: \n \nWell, the course is based on twenty modules, it\u201fs, like I say, it\u201fs a scientific based \norganization, which personally I think is really important because you share a lot \nof common ground with other people\u2026then in some of the answers you can \ninterpret your own belief system as well, y\u201fknow you can mix some of your \nexperiences in with scientific knowledge. \n 18 \n \nMark\u201fs overall feeling about his OBEs was that they had been mostly very positive \nand uplifting experiences. Despite the negative reactions from outside of the family, \nhe seemed to have become resolute in his belief that his OBEs were indeed as they \nappeared to be. Beyond being a source of comfort for himself, his mother and family, \nthere was a wider social implication. His OBEs had been instrumental in forging a \n\u201enew\u201f Mark, someone who has left behind old ways of inhibition, doubt and self-\nconsciousness, and had raised his self-esteem, provided him with access to a wider \nsocial network and afforded him a sense of being more in control of his life. The \ninitially negative response he had had to his experiences had encouraged him to be \nmore accepting of other's views, particularly of those who don't believe in the \nveridicality of his OBEs:  \n \nI\u201fd say it\u201fs been a very uplifting experience, erm, and a very positive \nexperience\u2026I would say since the experiences\u2026I\u201fm more conscientious about \nlife and I\u201fve found that I want to learn more\u2026I feel more in control of me own \nlife and I don\u201ft worry about what other people think as much. \n \nCindy\u201fs OBE seemed to have played a dual role in her life. As mentioned earlier, she \nfelt it was instrumental in warning her of her baby\u201fs impending illness and in reducing \nher fear of death and dying. She had an unwavering attitude towards most reactions to \nher story and attributed this to feeling so convinced that her OBE was completely \nveridical. She also attributed an increased sensitivity to death and accidents to her \nOBE, and felt this was a sign of having attained a spiritual connection with the world:  \n \n 19 \nWhen I got, when my dad died, y\u201fknow, I was, y\u201fknow, I wouldn\u201ft leave the \nroom, I knew and the funny thing is I knew he was going to die. No one in my \nfamily, didn\u201ft even know he was ill and I just\u2026I can sense things now really \nsense things\u2026I dunno, if there\u201fs a bit of a connection somewhere in whatever it is \nspiritual, I feel like I\u201fve got a bit of a connection now. \n \nLike Mark, Cindy\u201fs OBE was a catalyst for her starting to search for answers to \nexplain what had happened to her. Her early attempts to seek out explanations and \nanswers to her experience led her to attend a spiritualist church, and she began to \navidly study areas of the paranormal and spirituality.  \n \nDiscussion \nWithin this paper we have examined the longitudinal after-effects experienced by \npeople who have out-of-body experiences, and the nature of those after-effects, \nincluding the pathways people take whilst attempting to integrate their experiences, \nand the temporal, social and psychological factors that may impinge on the integration \nprocess. The above analysis has revealed that the OBE is both socially and affectively \ncomplex; the successful integration of which may add positively to a person\u201fs mental \nwell-being. In this section of the paper we will discuss these findings within a \ntheoretical context. \nAs discussed earlier, OBEs have sometimes been researched in the past in \nconnection with mental illnesses. Mental disorders themselves have attracted stigma \nthroughout history, often in the form of direct discrimination (personally, \ninstitutionally or structurally) or through social psychological processes which engage \nthe perceptions of the person being stigmatized, for example, psychosis (MacDonald, \n 20 \nSauer, Howie, & Albiston, 2005), schizophrenia (Dinos, Stevens, Serfaty, Weich, & \nKing, 2004), and bipolar disorder (Perlick et al., 2001). \nWhilst it can not be said that any of the participants in this study directly \nexperienced stigma and discrimination, some of the views expressed did suggest \nencounters with others who perceived a person who has OBE as having something \nelse \u201ewrong\u201f with them. Such negative perceptions alone can have debilitating effects \non a person\u201fs sense of identity and self-esteem. Poor experiences of self-disclosure \ncan also have negative long-term consequences in terms of how the experience may \nbe integrated. \nTo begin the process of successful integration, open and honest disclosure must be \nmet with acceptance, empathy and understanding, particularly if it is from those \nperceived by the experient as a caring and trusted role model. In this study, \nparticipants did find those sources of support, though not always where they might \nhave initially expected and not always upon first disclosure.  \nThe positive effects of successful sharing and disclosure of experiences such as \nOBEs have been noted by Palmer and Braud (2002), who found that scores on \nmeasures of disclosure of Exceptional Human Experiences (EHEs) positively \ncorrelated with measures of personal and existential meaning in life and psychological \nwell-being. There was also a negative correlation with stress related physical and \npsychological illnesses. \nAll participants in the present study emphasized positive aspects of their OBEs, \nsuch as finding greater meaning and a sense of purpose in life, compassion, happiness \nand a reduced fear of death. Similarly, in a questionnaire survey comparing OBErs \nand non-OBErs, Osis (1979) found that 88% of OBErs reported having beneficial \nchanges post-experience, such as, a deeper philosophical consideration of life and \n 21 \ndeath, and a reduced fear of dying. The positive moods reported post-OBE by \nparticipants here echoes findings from McCreery and Claridge (1995). In their work \non schizotypy, they found that OBErs scored higher on a measure of hypomania, \nwhich they found consistent with their model of schizotypy in that, to a certain \ndegree, the hypomania measure was tapping into a person\u201fs tendency towards positive \nmood states.  \nTwo of the three participants reported experiencing encounters with deceased \nindividuals during their OBEs. This is particularly interesting as while extant \nliterature suggests such experiences are a relatively common aspect of the near-death \nexperience (during which experients feels as if they are experiencing bodily death and \nthe continuation of consciousness outside of the body), they have not previously been \nreported as part of an OBE. This may be a methodological issue, in that previous \nstructured approaches to these issues have not enabled the expression of these facets \nof people\u201fs experiences. However, this also leads to the question of whether it was the \nOBE per se or the believed communications with deceased relatives that led to the \npositive effects (e.g. greater acceptance of death) reported here. However, it is a \ncommon report that the perceived detached of consciousness from the body during the \nOBE is sufficient to instill a belief that consciousness will continue after bodily death.  \nThe above participants reported their experienced communication with deceased \nrelatives as beneficial, helping them to cope with emotionally difficult situations that \nhad happened in their lives. Similarly, McCreery and Claridge (2002) have suggested \nthat there may be an adaptive value underlying some kinds of anomalous experiences, \nciting an example of someone who is experiencing post-operative pain before an \nOBE, who once having an OBE, then report less pain. Green and McCreery (1975) \nhave also described what they called \u201ereassuring apparitions\u201f, forms of hallucination \n 22 \nin which human figures appear which have the subsequent effect of calming a person \nwho is experiencing a stressful life event. This finding is in part supported by the \nwork of Palmer and Braud (2002) who found that there was a needs related aspect to \nthe occurrence of the EHEs that their participants were reporting. In many instances, \ntheir participants would recall how these experiences would happen as \u201chelper \nexperiences just when they needed the help\u201d (p.35).  \nAll three of the participants in this study had prior knowledge of OBEs before they \nhappened and had strong beliefs themselves about the nature and veridicality of the \nexperience. The role of an experient\u201fs belief system, particularly their belief in the \nparanormal, has also received research attention in relation to the \u201ehealthy schizotype\u201f \npersonality and the adaptive value of anomalous experiences. For instance, Williams \nand Irwin (1991) suggested that having a belief in the paranormal may provide \nindividuals with a mechanism by which to accept and explain their anomalous \nexperiences. This was supported by Schofield and Claridge (2007) who found that \nparticipants who had a framework by which to support their belief in the paranormal \nwere less cognitively disorganised and recounted their paranormal experiences as \nmore pleasant, which also may have a bearing on the experient\u201fs psychological well-\nbeing. The authors also suggest that persons with a weak belief framework may find \nthe same experience alarming and unwanted. This scenario fits well with the \nexperiences of all participants in the present study, who, despite some previous \nknowledge of OBEs and the paranormal before their OBEs, found their initial \nexperiences disturbing. However, upon subsequent reflection and with at least one \nadditional OBE a stronger belief has been forged that their experiences are veridical \nOBEs.   \n 23 \nIt must be noted, however, that there are limitations to this study. The three \nparticipants in this study are not entirely representative of the broader population of \nOB experients on two counts. Firstly, all three participants\u201f OBEs were sleep related \nand two of the three participants had there OBEs in conjunction with episodes of sleep \nparalysis. Paralysis is a not an uncommon onset feature of OBEs, for instance, in a \nstudy looking at how the two phenomena might be related, Blackmore (1999) \nexamined 201 reports of people who had experienced sleep paralysis and found that \n21% of them had also had OBEs. Secondly, one participant, John, did have a history \nof epilepsy for which he was taking meditation. It has been noted by some authors \n(e.g. Palmer & Neppe, 2003) that OBEs and other anomalous experiences have been \nlinked with temporal lobe symptomatology although John did describe himself as \u201cfit \nfree for ten years now\u201d and never reported having had an OBE during a seizure \nepisode. \nThe present study involves a small sample size and therefore broad claims about \nthe generalizability of the results to the wider OBE population are not made here. \nWhile IPA is not opposed to more general claims for larger populations, it is \n\u201ccommitted to the painstaking analysis of cases rather than jumping to \ngeneralizations\u201d (Smith & Osborn, 2008; p.54). While generalizable claims regarding \na sample in a single IPA are not made, as more studies with other samples are carried \nout with similar findings, more general claims become possible. Smith and Osborn \n(2008) refer to this as 'theoretical generalizability', rather than 'empirical \ngeneralizability'. With regards to the data presented in this study, the focus of interest \nhas been on the detailed experience and meaning of the OBE for the individual \nparticipants. While we do not make any claims that experiences are universal to all \n 24 \nOBEs or OBErs, we have explicated the meanings of the OBE which emerge for all \nthree participants.  \n \n \nConclusions \nThe qualitative findings presented here adds to existing knowledge of OBEs in \nshowing that participants tended to follow a pattern of healthy adaptation following \ntheir OBE(s), characterized by adaptive tasking (i.e. dealing with the implications of \nthe experience and sustaining everyday relationships) and the employment of active, \nconstructive coping strategies.  \nExperients first cognitively appraised and then redefined their OBEs, which \ninvolved moving from a period of initial confusion as to the causality of their \nexperience to later framing it as a positive life-affirming occurrence. Experients then \nengaged in more specific problem-focused behaviours in which they actively sought \nout information and support, and then, in some instances, acted upon that information, \nin order to further understand and bring meaning to their OBEs.  \nThe idiographic, phenomenological approach taken in this research has been \ninstrumental in highlighting the subtle personal and social factors that influenced how \nthe OBE was managed and integrated during the maturation process. The present \nwork, then, provides an in-depth account as to how the mental well-being of people \nmay be improved as a consequence of such anomalous experiences. \n \nAcknowledgements \nTBA\n 25 \nReferences \nAlvarado, C.
