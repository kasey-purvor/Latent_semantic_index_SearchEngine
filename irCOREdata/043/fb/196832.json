Introduction\nBearing failures are one of the most common reasons for breakdown of rotating \nmachines in industry today. Bearing defects manifest themselves as either excessive \nwear or damage in the rolling ball elements as well as in the inner\/outer races of the \nbearings [1]. Fault identification of a ball bearing-related phenomenon using \nconditional maintenance techniques has been the subject of extensive research for the \nlast two decades [2-4]. One of the possible approaches to fault monitoring of the \nbearings is the processing of vibration signals obtained from the external housings in \nwhich the bearings are mounted for extraction of diagnostic features [5]. This \ntechnique is more commonly known as vibration signature analysis and there are \nmany conventional procedures based on time harmonic and power spectrum analysis \nthat have shown considerable success in detecting failures in machine components [6, \n7]. If the bearings are in good condition, the distribution of the demodulated vibration \nsignals is Gaussian-like. When the bearings are damaged, the appearance of cracks \nand spallings disturbs the signals, modifying its distribution. Wide band impulse-like \nsignals are generated when the bearings pass over the defect points at a frequency \ndetermined by shaft speed, bearing geometry and defect location. The defective \nbearings\u2019 vibration signatures are spread across a wide frequency band and are easily \nmasked by noise and frequency components generated by the machine. Theoretical \nmodels of single and multiple point defects of the vibration produced by a faulty \nbearing under constant and varying radial loads, have been established by McFadden \nand Smith [8, 9]. Their model takes into account the impulse series generated by a \npoint defect in a bearing modelled from first principles as a function of the rotation \nand geometry of the bearing, the modulation of the periodic signal caused by non-\nuniform bearing load distribution, the transfer function of the vibration transmission \nfrom the rolling element bearing to the transducer, as well as the exponential decay of \nvibration.\nRaw vibration signals obtained from rotating machinery are usually \ncomplicated and immediate information for fault detection is not available. In \ndiagnostic and prognostic applications, there exist a wide variety of models, \nalgorithms and tools for data pre-processing and analysis to extract the useful \ninformation from the raw signals. Amongst these different time and frequency domain \n3based diagnostic techniques, vibration analysts often rely on the Power Spectral \nDensities (PSDs) of vibration data to monitor the health of moving parts of machinery \nas this method provides the most useful information. The spectral components allow \nthe identification of several types of faults. Common failures such as bearing faults \nand gear problems can be detected by trending major frequency components and their \namplitudes. Most of the frequency domain methods used in industry today are based \non the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) technique [10]. However, the FFT-based \nspectrum analysis method suffers from some shortcomings. One of its major setbacks \nis that a large number of frequency components have to be monitored due to the \ncomplexity of the system. A standard approach in evaluating an instantaneous \nfrequency implies the computation of the whole spectrum first and then estimation of \nthe amplitude of a particular frequency of interest. For instance, if ball bearing defect \nfrequencies [3] such as BPFO (Ball Pass Frequency of Outer Race), BPFI (Ball Pass \nFrequency of Inner Race), BSF (Ball Spin Frequency) and FTF (Fundamental Train \nFrequency, also known as Cage Frequency) are to be detected, FFT spectra are \ncomputed and then the spectra are filtered to monitor the presence of the fault \nfrequencies. Such a process can firstly be time consuming as whole frames of data \nhave to be estimated. Secondly, it can be power intensive as it involves processing \ntime proportional to NN 2log  computations where N  is the sample size. Another \nconcern of the FFT technique is that a large enough sample size has to be used for the \nspectral estimation for reasonable resolution capabilities as the resolution of the FFT \nis inversely proportional to the frame size utilized [11]. This might not be appropriate \nin real time applications.\nAn interesting statistical signal processing alternative is to evaluate directly the \nfrequencies of interest. In this case only those frequencies have to be estimated \ninstead of the whole spectrum. This provides a reduction in computing time and effort \nfacilitating real time estimation. In this study, characteristic bearing defect frequencies \nare extracted from the pole frequencies of a parametric time series AR model [12]. \nThe AR model is used to decompose the signals into a set of poles which have a \ncorrespondence to the peaks of the signals PSDs. Using the AR estimation technique, \nit is not necessary to obtain the whole spectrum. Instead, the evaluation of the pole \nfrequencies of interest from the derived AR parameters would suffice as AR \n4modelling allows spectral decomposition. This often just involves the calculation of \nthe AR coefficients and the variance of the input vibration signal [13]. Small order \nAR models can efficiently estimate the pole frequencies which correspond to the \npoles of the bearing defect frequencies. The AR technique also only requires a \nfraction of the samples that are required by the FFT method for the same resolution \n[12]. When compared to the traditional FFT method, the resolution of the AR \ntechnique is higher due to its implicit extrapolated autocorrelation sequence. This \nmeans that smaller sample sizes can be used for PSD estimation. The positions of the \npoles, which are the roots of the AR coefficient polynomial, vary for every frame of \nvibration data and the time varying behaviour of the spectral components can be \nmonitored by tracking the movement of the AR poles. Faults can be predicted by \nmovement of poles in the complex plane as the pole positions are expected to move \ncloser to the unit circle as the severity of the defect increases. From the position of the \npoles inside the unit circle, classification and quantification of the main spectral peaks \nof defect frequencies can be easily performed, leading to the possibility of having \nframe to frame monitoring of spectral parameters of interest.\nIn this paper, we present a study of fault identification through differences in \nthe behaviour of the AR poles for vibration signals collected from two similar high \nspeed dry vacuum pumps, one with a healthy set of bearings and another with a ball \nbearing with an inner race defect. The poles of the AR model are extracted as the \nfeature relating to the characteristic bearing defect frequencies and a classification \nscheme based upon the position of the coordinates of the Autoregressive (AR) poles is \nproposed and tested with real data.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. The paper first summarises the \nmodelling aspects of the vibration signals based on tracking of AR pole movement on \nthe parametric z domain. A description of the experimental hardware and data \nacquisition setup is then given. Experimental tests on vibration data obtained from a \npump with normal bearings and damaged bearings are given. Receiver Operating \nCharacteristics curves are plotted for increasing frame sizes of vibration data and the \nperformance of the classification scheme is tested. Finally, the conclusions are \npresented. \n52. The AR modelling technique\nAR modelling belongs to a class of modern spectral analysis techniques, which is \nmore generally known as Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) time series \nmodelling [10]. The AR method is the preferred method for this class since it is the \nbest compromise between temporal resolution and speed, efficiency and simplicity of \nalgorithms. An AR process of model order p  can be described by Eq. (1) where ka\nare the AR parameters, ][te  is white noise with zero mean and variance 2\uf073  and t  is \nthe discrete-time index [12]. The same equation expressed as a linear filter in the z-\ntransform domain is stated as Eq. (2).\n][][][\n1\ntektxatx k\np\nk\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d \uf0e5\n\uf03d\n(1)\n][][][\n1\nzEzazXzX kk\np\nk\n\uf02b\uf0d7\uf02d\uf03d \uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf0e5 (2)\nwhere ][zX  and ][zE  are the z-transforms of ][tx  and ][te  respectively. ][zH  is \ndefined as the AR polynomial of the model transfer function relating the input to \noutput and is denoted by Eq.(4).\n][1][\n1\nzEzazX kk\np\nk\n\uf03d\uf0fa\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\uf0eb\n\uf0e9 \uf02b\uf0d7 \uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf0e5 (3)\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\uf02b\n\uf03d\uf03d\np\nk\nk\nk za\nzE\nzX\nzH\n1\n1\n1\n][\n][\n][ (4)\nThe poles, kp , are obtained by finding the roots of the AR coefficient \npolynomial in the denominator of ][zH . An AR model's transfer function contains \npoles in the denominator plus only trivial zeros in the numerator at 0\uf03dz , so it is \n6referred to as an \"all-pole\" model. Since the coefficients of ][zH  are real, the roots \nmust be real or complex conjugate pairs.

(5), is better than the AR \ncoefficient representation, Eq. (1), for fault detection as the AR filter coefficients ka\nare not stable and are highly dependent on the filter order and do not reflect the signal \nproperties. The poles kp  are more closely related to the spectral form and contain \nimportant information on the system condition. For a stable AR filter, all kp  must be \nless than 1 and the nearer the pole is to the unit circle, the higher the corresponding \npeak in the AR spectrum.\nThere are four main methods for the estimation of the ka  coefficients: Yule-\nWalker, Burg, Least Squares Forward method and Least Squares Forward Backward \nmethod [12]. The AR parameters or the reflection coefficients are estimated in all \nthese methods. Generally all the four estimation methods produce comparable \nestimates when using large data samples. However, for moderate sample sizes, \ndifferences may arise in the behaviour of the estimation methods, especially the Least \nSquares Forward method and the Least Squares Forward Backward method which can \nyield unstable models.\nIn this study, we have chosen the oldest way of estimating the AR parameters \nwhich is the Yule-Walker approach. The Yule-Walker method calculates the AR \nparameters recursively, using estimated autocorrelation functions up to order p. The \nYule-Walker method with the Levinson-Durbin recursion was used to find the AR \ncoefficients [12] by solving a set of linear equations. However, the Burg method is the \nmost reliable and preferred estimation technique as it estimates the autocorrelation \nfunctions by minimizing the sum of squares of observed forward and backward \n7prediction errors. The Burg method provides reliable parameter estimates for practical \ndata as it is guaranteed to be stationary and is less biased than the Yule-Walker \nmethod. The strong bias of Yule-Walker gives unacceptable errors in many \napplications and should not be used for processes with unknown characteristics [14].\nHowever, in the current work it nevertheless did give useful results. It might be \nexpected that the Burg method would have given better results.\nThe PSD of the output signal, ][zP , is a function of the PSD of the input \nsignal ][zPe , which is noise. ][zP  is defined as\n][]\n1\n[][][ zP\nz\nHzHzP e\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf03d \uf02a\n(6)\nThe PSD of white noise is a constant and is given by its variance 2\uf073  and t\uf044 , the \nsampling interval, which is the inverse of the sampling rate sf .\ntzPe \uf044\uf03d 2][ \uf073 (7)\n][zP  can be obtained by replacing z  with \uf028 \uf029tfj \uf044\uf0702exp  and evaluating Eq.

A p th order AR model with p  poles \nwill have a maximum of m  peak frequencies where 2pm \uf03d  when p  is even and \n2)1( \uf02b\uf03d pm  when p  is odd. Not all poles give rise to sharp peaks in the AR \n8spectrum. Only the poles which are close to the unit circle give rise to sharp peaks in \nthe AR frequency spectrum (see Fig.1). The other poles are equally distributed around \nthe unit circle to create an equiripple \u2018flat\u2019 PSD estimation. The symmetry with \nrespect to the real axis is related to the fact that the signals have real values and this \nadvantage can be conveniently exploited by disregarding the poles in the negative \nimaginary plane, reducing the redundancy of poles in the pole tracking method.\nEach pole kp  has a phase k\uf066  and a magnitude kr which is the distance of the \npole from the origin and kr\uf02d1 which is the distance of the pole from the unit circle \n(see Fig.2). By knowing the pole position inside the unit circle, the central frequency \nkf  of each peak can be obtained from the phase k\uf066  of the pole if the sampling \nfrequency sf  is known (Eq. (9)). Since the AR time series is quasi steady stationary, \nthe positions of the poles vary with every frame of data. The trajectory mapped out by \nthe poles can be quantified by finding the area traversed by the poles over a period of \ntime. This aspect can be used as a parameter to indicate the condition of the bearing. \nThe area mapped out by a characteristic bearing frequency pole will be different \ndepending on whether they were obtained from no-fault or faulty conditions. The area \nmapped out by the migratory poles is given by Eq. (10).\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029 \uf070\uf066\uf070 2ReImtan2 1 skkkk fzzf \uf0b4\uf03d\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf03d \uf02d\n(9)\n\uf028 \uf029 kkrArea \uf066\uf044\uf0d7\uf044\uf0d7\uf03d 221 (10)\nThe power associated with each spectral pole kp  is estimated from the residues \nof the complex poles as proposed in [15].

Laboratory setup and data acquisition\nThis section contains a description of the test equipment and instrumentation used for \nobtaining the test signals used for the experimental phase of the work. A multistage \nIGX dry vacuum pump based on the \u2018Roots and Claws\u2019 principle [16] was used as the \nrotating machine. The schematic of the pump, the sensors used for capturing the data \nand the set-up of the data acquisition system are shown in Fig.3. \nThe pump has a single row of deep groove ceramic bearings at both the High \nVacuum (HV) and Low Vacuum (LV) ends. Such dry vacuum pumps are the pump of \nchoice in semiconductor and clean room environments where corrosive gases are \nabundant, temperatures are high and effluents resulting from the processes can cause \nseizure of the pumps. With constant use, it is possible that the ceramic bearings will \nfail over time because of their operation in such harsh running conditions. Whilst the \ndesign of dry vacuum pumps has remained relatively the same over the last ten years, \nmore emphasis is being employed in the evolution of intelligent pumping systems \nwith embedded sensors and self-diagnostic capabilities as dry vacuum pumps have \nbecome a critical part of the Integrated Chip (IC) wafer manufacturing process. Pump \nfailure can contribute to the significant loss of valuable products eg. loss of IC wafer \nbatches which produce significant financial losses. Also customers are affected by the \ninconvenience of down time. Hence high reliability and availability have become \nprimary customer requirements and early detection of incipient faults is vital to avert \ncostly failures and unscheduled maintenance.\n10\nTo simulate a fault condition in the dry vacuum pump, a test bearing which \nhad a single point defect on the inner race was mounted on the HV end. The \nacceleration signal was captured on the pump housing directly over the bearing casing \non the HV for normal (no-fault) and faulty conditions using two different types of \naccelerometers, namely, a surface micromachined accelerometer ADXL105 and a \nBr\u00fcel and Kj\u00e6r (B&K) 4370V accelerometer which were mounted radially on the \npump running at 105 Hz [17]. The signals from the ADXL105 were filtered with an\n8th order low pass elliptic anti-aliasing filter with a cut-off frequency of 10 kHz and an \nattenuation of 70 dB in the stop band. The vibration signals from the Br\u00fcel and Kj\u00e6r \n4370V were conditioned using a Br\u00fcel and Kj\u00e6r 2692 preamplifier that includes a 10 \nkHz lowpass filter. The analogue to digital conversion was performed with a 16-bit NI \n6034E Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC) card. The sampling rate was set to 40 \nkHz and varying lengths of signals were acquired. The data were then downsampled \nto 2 kHz as it was known that the frequencies of interest lie in the range from 0-1 kHz. \nPrior to downsampling, the vibration signals were also pre-processed by amplitude \ndemodulation [18]. If there is noise or other higher level vibrations generated by the \nother machine components, there is a chance that the harmonics of the defect \nfrequencies may be buried in the spectrum of the other components. To overcome this \nlimitation, the technique of amplitude demodulation is recommended. This involves \ntwo basic steps 1) bandpass filtering around one of the resonant peaks where there is \nstructural resonance 2) applying the Hilbert transform to the bandpassed signal to \nobtain the squared envelope [19]. This technique improves the signal-to-noise ratio of \nthe signal of the vibration signatures for a more effective detection of bearing defects.\n4. Relating AR pole positions with characteristic bearing defect \nfrequencies\nFormulas have been developed to calculate bearing defect frequencies for every \nbearing geometry, inner raceway, outer raceway and rolling elements [20]. For a \nbearing with a stationary outer race and inner rotating race, characteristic defect \nfrequencies (Eqs. (13) to (16)) can be obtained for flaws in the outer race, inner race, \nball bearings or in the cage as follows [3].\n11\nBearing Pass Frequency Outer Race (BPFO) = )]cos(1)[\n2\n( \uf061\nD\nDB\nP\nBN\nf \uf02d (13)\nBearing Pass Frequency Inner Race (BPFI) = )]cos(1)[\n2\n( \uf061\nD\nDB\nP\nBN\nf \uf02b (14)\nBall Spin Frequency (BSF) = ]))cos((1)[(\n2\n2\uf061\nD\nD\nD\nD\nP\nB\nB\nPf \uf02d (15)\nFundamental Train Frequency (FTF) = )]cos(1)[\n2\n( \uf061\nD\nD\nP\nBf \uf02d (16)\nThe five bearing parameters that must be known to calculate the bearing defect \nfrequencies are, DB - ball or roller diameter, DP - pitch diameter, BN - number of \nrolling elements, \uf061 - contact angle and f - shaft rotational frequency.\nThe specifications for the BOC Edwards IGX dry vacuum pump that was used as the \ntest bed in these experiments are: number of balls = 9, pitch diameter = 46.2 mm, ball \ndiameter = 9.5 mm and contact angle = 24.97 degrees. Using the standard reference \nformulas, the theoretical ball bearing defect frequencies BSF, BPFO, BPFI and FTF \nwere estimated to be around 492 Hz, 384 Hz, 561 Hz and 43 Hz respectively when the \npump\u2019s running speed was set to 105 Hz.\nThe characteristic bearing defect frequencies can be transformed to pole locations in \nthe z domain. As an example, consider the case of a defective bearing with an inner \nrace crack set to rotate at 105 Hz. The theoretical relative AR pole phase angles k\uf066\ncan be worked out if the sampling rate is known and in this case, the sampling rate sf\nused was 2000 Hz. The angle of the theoretical pole locations of the characteristic \nbearing defect frequencies are then worked out in degrees to be as shown in Fig.4 \nusing Eq. (17).\n12\n\uf0b0\uf0b4\uf03d\uf044 180\n2sf\nFrequencyDefectBearingsticCharacteri\nangle\n(17)\nThe angles of the AR pole locations are related to the characteristic bearing defect \nfrequencies. For a fixed rotating speed, the AR pole angles are fixed as they are \ndetermined by the geometrical shape of the ball bearings used but the distances of the \npole locations from the unit circle are determined by the levels of vibration at that \nparticular frequency. It is known that, as defects appear on the ball bearings and their \nseverity increases with time, the amplitudes of the vibrations of characteristic bearing \ndefect frequencies also increase (see Fig.5). The appropriate alarm level for the\nvibration signal can be determined from standards such as the IS0 10816 [21] and ISO \n7919 [22]. These can be translated to relative allowable amplitudes and alarm levels \nand hence corresponding pole displacements for the characteristic ball bearing defect \nfrequencies.\nThe distance parameter of the poles can be used as a useful indicator to \nclassify between faulty and non-faulty conditions. The frequencies of the \ncharacteristic bearing defect frequencies also do not remain the same due to variations \nof the speed of the machines resulting in pole angle variations in the z domain. The \narea of the region swept by the loci of the migratory poles can be used as another \nuseful fault indicator for diagnostic purposes. The power parameter is another good \nindicator as it is reflective of the energy content of the bearing signal studied. The \nvibration signal of a defective bearing is normally much higher than the vibration \nsignal obtained from good bearings as the energy of certain frequency bands are \nexcited due to the presence of faults. \nIn reality, a bearing with an inner race fault has BPFI occurring at 555 Hz\nwhich is slightly less than 561 Hz (where 561 Hz is obtained from Eq.(14) ). It was \nobserved that the rotating speed of the pump\u2019s rotor shaft, on which the bearing case \nwas directly connected to, was often less than the set speed of the pump due to rotor \nslip. It varied with external running conditions like the ultimate pressure of the inlet of \nthe pump. In this case, the actual speed achieved by the pump was 104.12 Hz \n(corresponding to a slippage factor of 1% - slippage is typically less than 5%). The \n13\nrunning speed of the pump had to be determined accurately for the diagnostics \nscheme, as this was the frequency which was used in the calculations of the bearing \ndefect frequencies [23]. This effect was taken into consideration when translating the \nbearing defect frequencies into pole positions.\n4.1. Fault detection using AR spectra\nFig.6 shows an example of the spectra for the data with the implanted inner \nrace fault on the HV end for the demodulated vibration signal plotted using both AR \n(Eq. (8)) and FFT techniques for frame sizes of \uf03dN 4000 samples. For the AR \nspectra, a model order of 10 was used. By careful examination, one can see that there \nis one major sharp spectral peak at the BPFI line. The dominant peak corresponds to \nthe inner race defect frequency (BPFI) of 556 Hz and is clearly evident in both FFT \nand AR spectra.\n5. AR pole-based monitoring\nThe proposed method of monitoring consists of two phases: training and detection. It \nis assumed that S bearing faults are to be monitored. These bearing faults can be \nBPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF or even multiples of these depending on the application to be\nstudied. The idea is to compare the frequency, distance, area and power of the poles of \nthe AR model in different time segments. It was required to choose a certain model \norder that adequately represents the demodulated vibration data for all time segments. \nSelection of the model order in the AR process is of critical importance. Too low an \norder produces a smoothed estimate, while too high an order may cause spurious \npeaks and spectral line splitting. For the purpose of the fault detection tool, the \noptimum model order was first determined for both the normal and faulty data using \norder selection criteria (please refer to authors\u2019 related work on finding the optimum \norder for the vibration signals [24]). A 10th order AR model was found sufficient to \nstudy the behaviour of the demodulated ADXL105 vibration signals mounted on the \nHV end for a pump operating in normal conditions and also for a pump fitted with a \nbearing with defects. Each bearing fault state is hence modelled by an AR model with \na fixed model order of \uf03dp 10.\n14\nTraining Phase:\n1. Each training set of vibration data was then formed constituting an observation of \nthe data when there are no faults in the bearings. First, the AR parameters are \nfound for the bearings in a healthy condition and subsequently, 2\uf073 , the variance \nof the input signal in the no-fault condition is also derived. \n2. Changes in the condition of the ball bearing and the non-stationarity of the \nvarying signal cause deviations in the AR coefficients which in turn result in \ndeviations in the AR pole positions. The positions of the AR poles vary in every \nframe. The AR poles, which are the roots of the AR coefficient polynomial, are \nobtained per frame of data. There are p  poles when a model order of p  is used. \n3. Out of these, the critical poles for each characteristic bearing defect frequency,\nare found. There is a one to one mapping between the characteristic bearing \ndefect frequencies and the angular frequencies of the critical poles (Eq. (17)). The \npoles of interest, which have angles closest to the angles corresponding to the \ncharacteristic bearing defect frequencies, are termed the \u2018critical poles\u2019 and are \nmonitored. \n4. Next, parameters \uf06c  are derived from the critical poles in the normal condition. \nThe parameter \uf06c  can be the area of the region swept by the migratory loci of the \ncritical poles, their distances from the centre of the of unit circle or the power of \nthe critical poles. The parameters \uf06c  reflect the characteristics of the time \ninvariant spectral parameters and comprise important information of the system \ncondition. The impulses produced by ball bearings with defects will be modelled \nby the changing system dynamics and this in turn will be reflected in the \nparameters \uf06c . The parameters \uf06c  are the conditional indicators that discriminate \nbetween the damaged and non-damaged bearings.\nDetection phase:\nBoundary conditions can be established using the known angles of \ncharacteristic defect frequencies and acceptable levels obtained from standards and \nthis can help the optimum threshold for the classification boundary to be determined.\nOnce the boundary conditions for the healthy signal are extracted and normalised for \nthe healthy condition, the procedure is repeated for the detection phase with vibration \nsignals from a test bearing. If the test bearing is a bearing with a defect, the parameter \n15\n\uf06c  of the critical poles will not normally be within the acceptable levels of the \nestablished boundary conditions (refer to Fig.7) or will be above a certain \npredetermined threshold. A reasonable threshold level can be chosen based on the \nprobabilities calculated from the training data. In this case, the threshold value was \ndetermined using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis.\nOne important and useful measure of the performance of any diagnostic test is \nROC curve analysis. A threshold is determined for separation of data into two classes \nbased on some decision parameter and depending on whether the subject falls below \nor above the cutoff level, the subject is termed \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019. In reality, \nthere will be some overlap between the two classes of data and depending on the \nposition of the threshold, some subjects will be misclassified as \u2018false positives\u2019 and \n\u2018false negatives\u2019. The sensitivity and specificity of the data are defined as\ndecisionspositiveactuallyofNumber\ndecisionspositivetrueofNumber\nySensitivit \uf03d (18)\ndecisionsnegativeactuallyofNumber\ndecisionsnegativetrueofNumber\nySpecificit \uf03d (19)\nROC curve analysis can be established by taking the parameters \uf06c  as the fault \nindicators, and then working out the condition and fault patterns of the ball bearings. \nDepending on what defect the bearing has, such as whether it is a defect on the inner \nrace or outer race, the defect can be identified. The above explained diagnosis \napproach is under the assumption that only one fault is present. However in reality, \nmultiple faults can develop simultaneously. In such a case, the scheme can be easily \nmodified to incorporate the diagnosis of multiple faults.\n5.1. A diagrammatic illustration of the procedure\nTracking the parameters \uf06c  is performed by processing each raw time domain sample \nthrough the stages shown in the diagram of Fig.8. This diagram summarises all the \nkey steps in processing the data and the major stages in obtaining the fault indicators \n16\nfrom the mapped critical poles. The AR coefficients are obtained from each time \nsample with fixed model order of 10 and subsequently, the AR pole positions per \nframe of data are also derived. The critical poles corresponding to the bearing defect \nfrequencies are identified. From the positions of the AR critical poles, parameters \uf06c\nare derived. The parameters \uf06c  are compared with those obtained from non-faulty \nconditions and the bearing is diagnosed to be whether in faulty condition or not.\n6. Results\nThe loci of the critical poles (BPFI) on the z plane were tracked in different time \nsegments, considering the mean and standard deviations of the parameters \uf06c , seeking \ndifferences between results for damaged and undamaged bearings (see Fig.9). Frame \nsizes of 4000 samples were used and 100 frames of data each of length 2 s were \nsubsequently processed to monitor the movement of the BPFI pole corresponding to \nthe inner race defect frequency. A 10th order AR model was used to estimate the \nparameters for successive segments. The distance of the BPFI pole from the origin, \npower of the BPFI pole, the angle mapped by the BPFI pole and the cumulative area \ntraversed by the BPFI pole were plotted for the vibration data for both normal and \nfaulty conditions. The mean \uf0b1  standard deviation distance of the BPFI poles from the \norigin in the non faulty case was 0.8005 \uf0b1  0.0580. The mean \uf0b1  standard deviation \ndistance of BPFI poles from the origin in the faulty case was 0.9303 \uf0b1  0.0148. It can \nbe seen than the mean distance of the BPFI poles was much larger for the faulty \ncondition than in the normal case. This will be seen as bigger amplitude of spectral \npeaks associated with critical poles (amplitude of spectral peaks is proportional to the \ninverse of the distance of a pole to the unit circle) when the AR spectrum is plotted \nfor the faulty condition. \nThe mean \uf0b1  standard deviation of the power of the BPFI poles in the non \nfaulty case was 9.570 410\uf02d\uf0b4 \uf0b1  2.831 410\uf02d\uf0b4  and in the faulty case 0.0369 \uf0b1  0.0086 \nrespectively. Clearly the power of the faulty poles is much larger than for the non-\nfaulty case. The power and distance of the poles from the origin are related and are \ndependent on each other. Though the distance and power of the BPFI critical poles \ncan be used as effective indicators for fault classification, the power is a better \nclassifier than the distance since it incorporates the variance term of the signal (which \n17\nis equal to the energy of the signal and energy of the faulty signal is much more than \nthe non-faulty one). In the example shown, the power seemed to increase with time as \nthe number of frames monitored increased. This is not surprising as the amplitude of \nvibrations also increased with time due to the pump heating up and increased friction \nof the bearings when it was running for a longer time. \nThe mean angle of the BPFI pole was 1.6117 radians (513 Hz) and 1.7441 \nradians (555 Hz) for normal and faulty condition respectively. The average mean \nangles of the BPFI poles in both cases were nearly the same. However the mean \nstandard deviation of the angles of the BPFI poles for the normal condition \n( \uf03d\uf044 k\uf066 0.3094) was much larger than for the faulty case ( \uf03d\uf044 k\uf066 0.097). The mean \nstandard deviation of the BPFI angles can be used as an indicator for fault \nclassification to distinguish between the no-fault and defective cases as the difference \nbetween them is significant. The changes in the frequency content of the characteristic \ndefect frequencies can be quantified by using AR modelling by looking at the \ncorresponding changes in the angles of the BPFI poles. The cumulative area traversed \nby the migratory faulty BPFI poles (less than 0.01) was also markedly much smaller \nthan the case for the non-faulty condition (0.2). This is because when there is a BPFI \nfault the pole corresponding to the BPFI frequency remains at almost the same \nposition, since there is a vibration at BPFI. When there is no BPFI fault the so called \n\u2018critical pole\u2019 is simply the pole closest to the BPFI angular frequency, but since there \nis no strong vibration at that frequency the non-faulty BPFI poles move considerably \nfrom frame to frame.\nIn order to model the changes in the vibratory signatures, the critical poles are \nobtained for 2 different frame sizes for both normal and faulty conditions. Fig.10 (a \nand b) shows the BPFI poles plotted for a frame size of 2000 samples. Fig.10 (c and \nd) shows the BPFI poles plotted for a frame size of 5000 samples. The BPFI pole was \nchosen as the dominant pole as the fault condition studied was the case of a pump \nfitted with a bearing with an inner race fault. If other bearing defects are to be \nmonitored, the corresponding critical pole positions relating to the characteristic \ndefect frequencies of significance can be tracked. The AR identification method \nplaced the faulty BPFI critical poles centred around 555 Hz. There was a significant \ndifference in the spread of the poles for the cases of damaged and undamaged \n18\nbearings respectively. For the faulty condition, the spread of the poles was more\nconcentrated and nearer to the unit circle for both frame sizes. For the non-faulty \nBPFI poles, the spread of the poles was much wider. When one compares Fig.10 (b \nand d), they were plotted using the same data but it can be seen the frame size used \ncan have an effect on the location of the coordinates of the AR poles. The difference \nobtained is probably due to the fact that when a bigger frame size was used, the \nmapping of the poles seems to be more deterministic and definite. For Fig.10 (d), the \nlocation of the BPFI poles seems to be either on the right or left of the BPFI \ncharacteristic defect frequency. In reality, the demodulated vibration data from a good \nbearing looks more like white noise and there is no actual significant peak and hence \nno corresponding BPFI pole in that sense. Because of our definition of the critical \npole been the closest pole to the characteristic defect frequency and hence the BPFI \npole in this case, the method has located the poles which happen to be closest in \nangular frequency to the BPFI frequency. The frequency variation of the characteristic \nbearing defect frequency (BPFI) was much less for the faulty data than the normal \ndata. The complex conjugate poles fell closer to the unit circle for vibration data \nobtained from faulty conditions. For normal data, the amplitudes of the dominant \npoles (moduli) were considerably smaller than their counterparts for the faulty case.\n6.1. Sensitivity, Specificity and ROC curve analysis\nROC curve analysis was used to determine suitable threshold levels for the fault \nindicators such as the AR poles distances from the centre of unit circle and the AR \npoles power for faulty and normal cases. The distribution of the normal and faulty AR \npoles power and distance is shown in Fig.11 and Fig.12 as histograms. A frame size \nof 2000 samples was used for these. In terms of power, a near perfect classification \ncan be seen. When the power (using Eq. (12)) of the AR poles of the vibration data of \nthe good bearings were tracked, it can be seen that they all had power values of less \nthan 0.005. But when the power of the AR poles of the vibration data of the bearing \nwith an inner race defect was tracked, the faulty poles\u2019 power had a wide distribution. \nThey had values ranging from 0.015 to 0.065. Although there was no overlapping of \nthe values. Hence the power indicator of the AR poles can be used as a \u2018perfect\u2019 fault \nclassifier. For the distance of the AR poles from the origin of the unit circle, the \nnormal poles had a distribution ranging from 0.4 to 0.95. The faulty poles had a \n19\ndistribution ranging from 0.81 to 0.97. There was some overlapping between the two \nclasses. For instance, if 0.9 was chosen as the threshold level to determine if the poles \ncorresponded to the case of damaged or non-damaged bearings, there is a chance that \nsome normal poles with a distance of more than 0.9 are misclassified as faulty poles \nand vice versa. However it was noted that the frame size used did have an effect on \nthe amount of overlapping between the two classes of data and hence the sensitivity \nand specificity of the analysis. Fig.13 shows the distribution of normal and faulty \npoles for the distance indicator but for a bigger frame size of 5000 samples. It can be \nseen that there is less overlapping between the classes compared to Fig.12 and hence \nless chance of misclassification.\n6.2. Frame size versus increase in accuracy of classification\nThe diagnostic effectiveness of the decision parameter (the distance of the \ncritical poles from the origin in the unit circle) was estimated by constructing a curve \nof sensitivity against specificity for windows of increasing frame sizes of 1100 to \n5000 samples. The poles with a distance from the origin smaller than the threshold \nwere termed the \u2018true negative\u2019 (non-faulty data). The poles with a distance from the \norigin greater than the threshold were termed the \u2018true positive\u2019 (faulty data). The task \nthen becomes one of discriminating between the faulty and non-faulty data. The upper \nROC curve is for a frame size of 5000 samples and the lower curve is for 1100 \nsamples per frame. The corresponding ROC curve for the AR BPFI poles distance \nindicator is shown in Fig.14. Each point on the curve represents the combination of \ntrue negatives against false positives estimated for a given threshold of the parameter. \nThe aim is to maximise detection probability while minimizing false alarm rates. A \ngood test curve is one for which sensitivity rises rapidly and 1- specificity hardly \nincreases at all until the sensitivity is high. Using a frame size of 2000 samples gives a \nsensitivity of 92% and a 1-specificity of 8%. If it is desired to increase both sensitivity \nand specificity, a bigger frame size can be used. Frames with 4000 samples \n(corresponding to 2 s of data collection) produced excellent results with sensitivity \nand specificity of 99%. This means that the undamaged and damaged bearing with the \ninner race defect can be distinguished with almost 100% accuracy. It is obvious that \nas the frame size increases the improvement in the classification also increases. The \nsensitivity and specificity versus distance curves for a frame size of 4000 samples are \n20\nshown in Fig.15. For example, selecting a distance value of 0.885 as threshold, leads \nto a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 99%.\n7. Conclusions\nA formal framework for automated assessment of bearing faults using AR pole \npositions has been established. Metrics in the form of area, angle, power and distance \nof the AR pole positions (parameters \uf06c ) were defined for fault detection purposes. By \nquantifying the values of these parameters \uf06c , bearing faults can be identified. The \ncharacteristic bearing frequencies were modelled and mapped using the AR method. \nThe critical poles are defined as those poles which are the closest in terms of angular \ndisplacements from the characteristic bearing frequencies poles\u2019 positions. It is \nproposed that the parameters \uf06c  are then compared with the baseline figures obtained \nfrom healthy bearings to detect the presence of faults. A higher power and a bigger \ndistance from the origin of the AR poles will be indicative behaviours of faulty \nbearings.\nThe AR pole representation allows a more straightforward quantitative \nestimation of the spectral parameters and facilitates the understanding of the intrinsic \nspectral characteristics of the process. There is a one-to-one correspondence between \nthe position of the AR poles and the spectral peaks. By studying the movement of \npoles in the complex z-plane, the development and progression of bearing faults can \nbe monitored. It was shown, with experimental results that the AR poles move closer \nto the unit circle as the severity of the defects increase. The application of the \nproposed scheme enabled the detection of the damaged bearings with an inner race \ndefect with a 100 % detection rate when a frame size of more than 4000 samples was \nused when the distance of the critical poles was used as the fault indicator. With a \nsmaller sample size of 2000 samples, a lower detection rate of 92% was achieved. \nWhen power was used as the fault indicator, a 100 % detection rate was obtained even \nfor small sample sizes such as a sample size of 2000 samples, indicating that this \nprocessing methodology is very effective even for short data records. The simplicity \nof the use of the classification parameters \uf06c , the short length of data needed for the \ndiagnostics (2 seconds) and the obtained specificity and sensitivity of the \nclassification scheme reveal the relevance and usefulness of model based diagnostics \nsystem in the classification of normal and faulty bearings. Results show that tracking \n21\nthe movement of the AR critical poles as a maintenance decision-making criterion, \nthis method can be used effectively to detect changes in the frequency and power of \nthe faulty bearings and consequently differentiate pumps running in normal and \ndefective working environments. \nIt is speculated that the proposed  technique would also be usable for other types \nof machines or machine elements as long as a model for the system can be obtained \nand the frequencies of likely localised faults can also be calculated. It is also \nspeculated that this technique would be useful even if have no a priori knowledge of \nthe behaviour of non-faulty pumps as when there is a localised fault, this can be seen \nas the concentrated clustering of poles around a localised frequency in the unit circle \nand this behaviour is characteristic of the existence of a propagating fault as can be \nseen in Fig.10 (c). Hence with the use of the proposed detection tool, the current state \nof a structure or machine element can also be detected without any information about \nits undamaged or initial state.\n22\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank EPSRC (grant GR\/S42866\/0), which funded Suguna \nThanagasundram\u2019s PhD studies, BOC Edwards for the supply of the IGX dry vacuum \npumps, Barden Bearings for providing us the faulty ceramic ball bearings on which \nour experimental investigations were based on and Mr. Kalu Gurung for conducting \nsome of the preliminary investigations on the pole tracking method as part of his final \nyear project in 2005.\n23\nREFERENCES\n[1].
