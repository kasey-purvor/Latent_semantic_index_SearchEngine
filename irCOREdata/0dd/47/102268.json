The linear separability effect refers \nto the difficulty of searching for a target that falls between the distractors in CIE colour space \n(Bauer, Jolicoeur, & Cowan, 1996a). Observers performed nonlinearly separable searches where \nthe target fell between the two types of distractors in CIE colour space. When the target and \ndistractors fell within the same category, search was difficult. When they fell within three \ndistinct categories, response times and search slopes were significantly reduced. The results \nsuggest that categorical information, when available, facilitates search, reducing the linear \nseparability effect.  \n \n 2\n                                                            Categorical effects   3 \nCategorical effects in visual search for colour \nA well documented phenomenon imposing constraints on visual search is the linear \nseparability effect (Bauer, Jolicoeur, & Cowan, 1996a; D\u2019Zmura, 1991). In visual search for a \ntarget among a display of heterogeneous distractors, search is \u2018easy\u2019 or \u2018efficient\u2019\uf8e7as \ndemonstrated by flat search slopes\uf8e7 if it is possible to draw a single line in stimulus space that \nseparates the target from the distractors (linearly separable). Conversely, search is \u2018difficult\u2019 or \ninefficient\u2019, resulting in steeper search slopes, if the target falls inside the area defined by the \ndistractors in stimulus space (linearly nonseparable). The effect has been demonstrated in CIE \ncolour space (Bauer et al., 1996a, 1996b, 1998; D\u2019Zmura, 1991) but also in other feature spaces \nsuch as size (Hodsoll & Humphreys, 2001) or shape (Arguin & Saumier, 2000).  \nFigure 1 shows the simple case where there are two types of distractor. As can be seen, \nwhen the target T falls between the two distractors D1 and D2, it is not linearly separable from \nthe distractors as no single line can be drawn that separates T from both D1 and D2. When \nhowever the target is offset from the D1-D2 line, or when it is still co-linear with the distractors \nbut does not fall between them, it is possible to separate the target from the distractor space with \na single line. D\u2019Zmura (1991) suggested the operation of a linear discrimination mechanism \nwhich is available only if the search items are linearly separable. For nonlinearly separable \nsearches, a single discrimination mechanism is not adequate and serial inspection of the items on \nthe display is necessary. \nInsert Figure 1 about here \n \nAs mentioned above, Bauer et al. (1996a) demonstrated the linear separability effect in \nCIE colour space. In a series of visual searches using a wide range of colour stimuli varying in \n 3\n                                                            Categorical effects   4 \nhue, saturation and\/or lightness, they showed that search for targets linearly separable from the \ndistractors is easy, producing essentially flat slopes, while search for nonlinearly separable \ncolours is difficult, producing steeper slopes. They also showed that the linear separability effect \nwanes as the target-distractor distance increases to more than 30 CIELUV (\u2206E) units, and is \neventually abolished. For large colour differences, therefore, the linear separability effect no \nlonger holds and search becomes effortless. \nThe findings of Bauer et al. suggest a quite clear dichotomy between \u2018serial\u2019 and \n\u2018parallel\u2019 search: a linearly separable target pops out, while a nonseparable target does not. In the \nformer case it can be assumed that search is stimulus-driven and mediated by bottom-up \nprocessing. In nonseparable searches, however, the task becomes much more demanding, since \nlow-level discrimination between target and distractors is no longer adequate. One question that \narises is whether, in this case, observers could make use of top-down processing to guide search. \nIn other words, if observers had access to specific knowledge about the target, would use of this \nknowledge facilitate search performance? In the present study we addressed the possibility that \ncategorical knowledge of the search stimuli may improve performance even if the target and \ndistractors are not linearly separable.  \nTo address this, we needed to manipulate not only the spatial arrangement of the target \nand distractors in colour space (linearly separable versus linearly non-separable)  but also their \ncategorical status. Consider, for example, the case when the target falls between the two \ndistractors (Figure 1). If the observer categorises the target as \u2018purple\u2019 and the two distractors as \n\u2018blue\u2019 and \u2018pink\u2019, then the three stimuli fall in separate colour categories. We suggested that \nobservers could use this categorical distinction could be to guide and facilitate search, even in the \ncase where linear nonseparability makes the search difficult. Conversely, if, for example, all \n 4\n                                                            Categorical effects   5 \nthree colours were categorised as \u2018blue\u2019, there would be no categorical information to assist \nsearch and nonseparable search would remain difficult.      \nBauer et al. (1996a, Experiment 1) used colours that \u201ccould be described as desaturated \nred, orange, and yellow\u201d (p. 1443), as well as colours that were all \u2018green\u2019 or \u2018blue\u2019 (p.1453). \nTheir results showed that nonlinearly separable search was difficult, replicating the findings of \nD\u2019Zmura (1991). There was no evidence of search being more efficient when the target and \ndistractors fell in separate categories. Thus it could be argued that the categorical status of the \nstimuli is unlikely to have an effect on search performance. However, Bauer et al. did not have \nnaming data on the colours they used in their study; although they briefly considered the \npossibility of categorical effects in visual search, they did not address this issue systematically. \nIn the present study, we used colours that clearly fall in separate colour categories, as established \nby naming consensus, and which are considered good examples of each category. Our aim was \nto examine whether knowledge of the categorical status of target and distractors can aid search.  \nA number of studies provide evidence for the operation of top-down mechanisms in \nvisual search. Comparison of blocked and mixed conditions, i.e. when the target is known in \nadvance and when it is not, has shown that pre-knowledge of the target facilitates performance \n(e.g. Bravo & Nakayama, 1992; Hodsall & Humphreys, 2001). Advance knowledge of the target \nmay be particularly useful under resource-limited conditions (Lavie, 1995; Moore & Egeth, \n1998). Laarni (1999, 2001) also showed that visual search benefits most from colour cues when \nthe processing load is high, by prioritising selection of the cued item. Task difficulty, as \ndetermined, for example, by display size, low target-distractor discriminability or low target \nsalience, can be controlled by top-down guidance (Laarni, Koski, & Nyman, 1996). As \nnonseparable searches are demanding tasks, they should also be subject to top-down control.  \n 5\n                                                            Categorical effects   6 \nThere is also evidence implicating the use of categorisation in visual search, although it is \ndebatable whether the reported categorical effects can be attributed to physical or conceptual \ndifferences between the stimuli (see below). In a series of experiments on visual search for \norientation, Wolfe, Friedman-Hill, Stewart, and O\u2019Connell (1992) found that search efficiency \nincreased when the target could be identified as belonging to a different, mutually exclusive \ncategory from the distractors. The categorical effect may assist the grouping of the \nheterogeneous distractors, thus permitting the target to be assigned a unique attribute which \nfacilitated search.  \nInterestingly, Wolfe et al. (1992, Experiment 2) included an experiment where the target \nwas not linearly separable from the distractors (the target, whose orientation was either 0\no \nor 20\n o\n, \nwas flanked between two distractors tilted 20\no or 40\no away from the target). In line with Bauer et \nal. (1996a), searches for the nonlinear separable target (for the 20\no\n target) were not efficient, \nalthough search became easier when the target-distractor distance increased. However, the linear \nseparability effect appeared to be reduced considerably (leading to almost flat slopes) when the \ntarget was 0\no\n. In this case the target could be labelled as \u2018vertical\u2019 among distractors labelled as \n\u2018tilted\u2019. Wolfe et al. point out, however, that the categorical effect could be attributed either to \ntop-down selection of the \u2018vertical\u2019 feature or to bottom-up activation of orientation-tuned \nchannels. It remains unclear, therefore, whether categorical effects are related to the early \nperceptual processes or to activation of higher level conceptual representations. \nIndeed, as mentioned above, there is a debate in the literature on categorical effects in \nvisual attention. Early studies on visual search for digits among letters, or the reverse, suggested \nthat it is category membership, rather than perceptual features, that accounts for parallel visual \nsearch (Egeth, Jonides, & Wall, 1972). Jonides and Gleitman (1972) also argued for \n 6\n                                                            Categorical effects   7 \n\u2018conceptually driven\u2019 visual search: search occurred in parallel even for an ambiguous O, which \nwould be categorised as the letter O or the digit 0 prior to search. However, there have been \nproblems with replicating this result (Duncan, 1983). Krueger (1984) attributed the category \neffect to physical rather than conceptual differences between target and distractors: when \nstructural differences between the stimuli were eliminated, the category effect was abolished.  \nMore recently, Levin, Takarae, Miner, & Keil (2001) re-addressed the role of categorical \ninformation in visual search. In a series of searches for animals among artefacts and vice versa, \nthey demonstrated essentially shallow slopes and fast response times for target present trials. \nThey mainly discussed structural factors to account for their results. Basic features such as \ncontour shape and rectilinearity and higher-level factors, like rated visual typicality, affected \nsearch efficiency. As a number of factors operating at different levels were involved, it is \ndifficult to draw conclusions about the locus of the categorical effect. However, Levin et al.\u2019s \nstudy is interesting as it provides evidence for the involvement of categorisation in a perceptual \ntask.     \nCurrent models of visual search and attention may also be consistent with the role of \nstimulus categorisation in visual search efficiency. Particularly relevant here are the similarity \nmodel of Duncan and Humphreys (1989) and the guided search model (Wolfe, 1994; Wolfe, \nCave, & Franzel, 1989). According to the similarity model, the visual field is represented as a \nhierarchy of \u2018structural units\u2019 sharing a property such as colour. During visual search, each \nstructural unit is compared to a template of the information being sought i.e. the target. A poor \nmatch between the template and a structural unit leads to rejection of other units that are strongly \ngrouped to the rejected unit. When the target is similar to the distractors, more structural units \nmatch the template, so search time increases. Similarly, search times increase when the \n 7\n                                                            Categorical effects   8 \ndistractors are dissimilar, as it is difficult to group together and reject large numbers of structural \nunits. Thus, when the target is nonlinearly separable from the distractors, processes based on \nsimilarity only will be inadequate and search inefficient. \nAccording to the guided search model (Wolfe, 1994; Wolfe et al., 1989), three stages are \ninvolved in visual search: (1) During early stages in vision the image is divided into individual \nfeature maps, with one map for each feature (e.g. colour, orientation etc.). Within each map, a \nfeature is filtered into multiple categories (e.g. colour categories).  (2) Bottom-up processes \ncompute differences between stimuli. If there is more than one feature map (e.g. conjunction \nsearches) differences for each feature map are combined. (3) Top-down activation guides \nattention to items with a specific set of properties (e.g. a red square). (4) An activation map is \nbuilt from bottom-up and top-down elements, where priority is given to stimuli meeting the \nsearch criteria of the activation map.  \nThe findings of Hodsoll and Humphreys (2001) in the size dimension are particularly \ninteresting in this respect. Foreknowledge of the target, allowing top-down guidance, was most \nbeneficial when the stimuli were linearly separable, i.e. when the target was either the \u2018large\u2019 or \nthe \u2018small\u2019 square. Nonlinearly separable searches where the target was the middle square \nbenefited considerably less from advance target knowledge.  Hodsoll and Humphreys attribute \nthe linear separability effect to the operation of a top-down linear separator mechanism that \nallocates attentional priority to the target. This mechanism is most successful for linearly \nseparable stimuli because, in this case, target-distractor similarity is low and distractor-distractor \nsimilarity is relatively high. \nAs mentioned above, here we suggest that if the target is categorically distinguishable \nfrom the distractors, top-down guidance can also facilitate performance in nonlinearly separable \n 8\n                                                            Categorical effects   9 \nsearches. Duncan and Humphreys (1989) would suggest that a nonlinearly separable search is \ndifficult because the similarity between stimuli makes the linear separator mechanism inadequate \n(see Hodsoll & Humphreys, 2001). The guided search model, on the other hand, would predict \nthat if the target is known in advance and possesses a unique attribute, then this may provide \naccess to a clearly defined template that is used to guide search. This is the case, for example, in \nsome conjunction searches where top-down activation of the target\u2019s identity facilitates search \n(Wolfe et al., 1989).  In a nonlinearly separable search where the target is categorically distinct \nfrom both distractors, search performance should be a compromise between: (1) discrimination \ndifficulty imposed by low distractor-distractor similarity and high target-distractor similarity and \n(2) facilitation through use of categorical information.  \nThe experiments reported below addressed the possibility that observers are able to use \ncategorical information to facilitate visual search for nonlinearly separable stimuli. Experiments \n1 to 3 compared nonseparable and linearly separable conditions when the stimuli straddled \ncategory boundaries and when they did not, while the perceptual distance between the colours \nwas controlled. As in Bauer et al. (1996a), the colours were chosen to be equidistant in CIELUV \nspace. Since this colour system is intended to be perceptually uniform (for a description see, for \nexample, Hunt, 1987), it should be expected that discriminability between colours would be \nroughly the same in all conditions.  \nEXPERIMENT 1 \nExperiment 1 partly replicated the study by Bower et al. (1996a), using the same visual \nsearch procedure: search for one previously learned target among two types of distractors. As in \nBauer et al., linear separability was manipulated: nonseparable search (expected steep slopes) \nand separable search (expected flat slopes). However, categorical information about the stimuli \n 9\n                                                            Categorical effects   10 \nwas also introduced as a factor, to explore whether this information can be used to facilitate \ndifficult (nonseparable) search. The categories used were drawn from the eleven basic colour \ncategories of English (Berlin & Kay, 1969) and should thus have been familiar and salient to our \nsubjects. When there was a categorical distinction among target and distractors, the target and \ntwo types of distractor were in three different categories. Thus there were four conditions in \ntotal: linearly separable\/within category (same category target and distractors); linearly \nseparable\/cross-category (different category target and distractors); nonseparable\/within \ncategory; and nonseparable\/cross category. \nMethod \nParticipants \nEight observers took part, 3 male and 5 female (mean age = 28 years). They were \nstudents or staff from the University of Surrey and they all had normal or corrected-to-normal \nvision and normal colour vision as assessed by the City University Colour Vision Test (Fletcher, \n1980).  \nStimuli \nSix colour stimuli were used: three each for the within and cross-category conditions. The \nwithin category stimuli were all green (green1, green2 and green3) and the cross-category stimuli \nwere blue, purple, and pink. The CIELUV co-ordinates are shown in the Appendix (Figure 1). \nWithin each category condition, the CIELUV distance between the target and distractor was \napproximately 20 \u2206E (see Table 1 in the Appendix). This distance is near the critical colour \ndifference in visual search (see Nagy & Sanchez, 1990). All stimuli in each set had the same \nlightness (L = 76.07 for the cross-category set; L = 62.87 for the within category set1). Naming \nreliability was checked beforehand by asking 15 observers who did not participate in the \n 10\n                                                            Categorical effects   11 \nexperiment to name the stimuli presented singly on the monitor. In addition, the participants in \nthe experiment named the stimuli at the end of the search task. Minimum naming reliability was \n98%. \nAs can be seen in the Appendix (Figure 1), the three stimuli were co-linear in LUV space \nfor all conditions.  In the two nonseparable conditions, the target was always the middle colour. \nIn the two separable conditions, the same stimuli were used, but the target was either of the two \nlateral colours. Thus, in the within category condition, the target was green2 (nonseparable); \neither green1 or green3 was the target in the separable condition. In the cross-category condition, \npurple was the target for the nonseparable search and either blue or pink was the target for the \nseparable condition (see Table 2 in the Appendix). \nStimuli were positioned on a notional 6 \u00d7 6 grid in the search display, against a nearly \nwhite background (x = 0.31, y = 0.32, Y = 35). Each location had dimensions of 17mm2, \nsubtending a visual angle of approximately 1.90 at an average viewing distance of 500 mm. \nThere were three set sizes: 4, 16 and 36. For set size 4 or 16, stimulus locations were randomly \nselected in the grid. For set size 36, stimuli were present in all locations in the grid. For target-\nabsent trials, there was an equal number of each of the two distractor colours. For target-present \ntrials, a target replaced one of the distractor colours. As in Bauer et al. (1996a), the location of \ntargets in the matrix was random, with the exception that targets never appeared in any of the \nfour corners of the grid. The target occurred equally often in the remaining 32 positions within \neach condition.  \nProcedure \nEach participant performed all four conditions. The order of category condition \n(within\/across) was counterbalanced. Linearly separable and nonseparable conditions were \n 11\n                                                            Categorical effects   12 \npresented alternately. Each condition consisted of a training phase immediately followed by the \nsearch task. \nTraining phase. The first part of the training consisted of showing the target and the two \ndistractors at the same time. Labels indicated the target and the distractors. When the observers \nthought they could remember the target, they proceeded to the second training stage, a forced-\nchoice identification task in which stimuli were presented one at a time, after the onset of a \nfixation cross. For each presented stimulus the observers had to decide whether it was the target \nor a distractor. Decisions were indicated by pressing the mouse-buttons (left, target; right, \ndistractor). Twenty presentations of each of the three stimuli in the condition were given in a \nrandom order. If participants made fewer than 20% misidentifications, they proceeded to the \nsearch task. If their performance on the training stage was poorer than 80%, training was \nrepeated.  \nVisual search task. When it was established that the observers had learned the target, they \nmoved on to the search task. In this stage, 192 trials were given, 64 for each display size: 4, 16 or \n36 stimuli. For each display size, the target was present in 50% of the trials and absent in the \nother 50% of the trials. Trials were presented in random order.  \nEach trial was preceded by a fixation cross that remained on the screen for 250 ms, \nfollowed by a 400 ms blank interval before presentation of the search display. The search display \nremained present until a response was made. Decisions were indicated by pressing the mouse \nbutton (left for target present, right for target absent). A 400 ms interval was given between \nsuccessive trials. The observers were instructed to respond as fast as possible, but not to \ncompromise accuracy.  \n 12\n                                                            Categorical effects   13 \nResults and Discussion \nInsert Figure 2 about here \n \nMedian response times (RTs) for correct trials were calculated for each participant for \neach condition. All reported RTs are cross-participant means of the median correct RTs. Figure 2 \nshows RT as a function of display size for each condition, for target present and target absent, \nrespectively. Search slopes and overall percentage of errors for each condition are shown in \nTable 1. \nInsert Table 1 about here \nAs can be seen in Figure 2, search for linearly separable stimuli was faster than search for \nnonseparable stimuli (linear separability effect). This effect was dramatically reduced in the \ncross-category condition, indicating efficient search even for nonseparable cross-category \nsearches. The slopes and error rates displayed in Table 1 also support this pattern of results. \nNote, particularly, that the error rate for the within category nonseparable condition (19.08%) is \nconsiderably larger than the rate for the cross-category nonseparable condition (2.80%).  \nThree-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were carried out separately for target present \nand target absent trials, with linear separability (separable\/nonseparable), category (cross\/within) \nand set size as factors. For target present trials, RTs were faster in the cross-category conditions \nthan the within category conditions, F (1, 7) = 112.14, p < 0.001. The linearly separable \nconditions were also faster than the nonseparable conditions: F (1, 7) = 60.83, p < 0.001. RT also \nincreased with set size:  F (2, 14) = 15.44, p < 0.001. All two-way interactions were also \nsignificant. The effect of linear separability was greater for the within category condition than \nthe cross-category condition, F (1, 7) = 77.20, p < 0.001. The effect of set size was also greater \n 13\n                                                            Categorical effects   14 \nfor within category than cross-category searches, F (2, 14) = 12.40, p < 0.002, and greater in \nnonseparable searches than linearly separable searches, F (2, 14) = 12.36, p < 0.002. The three-\nway interaction was also significant, F (2, 14) = 10.24, p < 0.003. This resulted from the linear \nseparability effect on search slopes being larger for the within category condition but \nsignificantly smaller in the cross-category condition. The above effects were also significant in \nthe analysis of target-absent trials and ANOVA on error rates also showed a similar pattern of \nresults.  \nAs predicted, search was more efficient when for linearly separable stimuli than for \nnonseparable stimuli. The linear separability effect reported in Bauer et al. (1996a) was therefore \nreplicated. Moreover, an important finding in Experiment 1 was the effect of categorical \nseparation on search performance. This was evident as faster search in both the nonseparable and \nseparable conditions. Search slopes also indicated very efficient search when the target and \ndistractors fell in distinct categories, even if they were nonlinearly separable. Indeed, the search \nslopes in this condition, being smaller than 10 msec\/item, suggest perceptual pop-out of the \nnonlinearly separable target. It could therefore be argued that, when the target is categorically \ndistinguishable from the distractors, it can be used more efficiently as a template in guided \nsearch: searching for the purple item among non-purple distractors is evidently easier than \nsearching for the \u2018middle green\u2019 item among green distractors. Moreover, it seems that \npossessing clearly defined categories for the target and distractors is important for the category \nadvantage in search. As discussed earlier, Bauer et al. (1996a) examined search performance \nusing an orange target among yellow and red distractors, reporting difficult search when the \nstimuli were nonseparable. If the results of the present experiment can be attributed to \ncategorical effects, it seems that agreement on stimulus naming is necessary, and that the search \n 14\n                                                            Categorical effects   15 \nstimuli must be good examples of a colour category. It is therefore possible that Bauer et al. did \nnot observe a category effect because their stimuli were unlikely to be good examples of red, \norange and yellow: as the stimuli were desaturated and equiluminant, it was unlikely that they \nwould be good members of colour categories that are mainly distinguished by changes in \nsaturation and lightness (see, for example, the Munsell system; Indow, 1988).  \nThe level at which the categorical advantage operates is not clear. It seems unlikely that \nthe categorically distinct target is easier to detect because it contains some salient basic feature \ninformation, as, in perceptual space, it is the \u2018middle\u2019 stimulus. Some categorical representation \nof the categorically distinct target must therefore be available. Conceptual representations of \ncolour categories, available for \u2018purple\u2019 but not for \u2018middle green\u2019, could drive the search \nprocess by directing attention to the relevant stimulus.   It is also unclear how search facilitation \noperates: does using the categorical template facilitate search by enhancing perception of the \ntarget, or simply by prioritizing its selection? These issues will be discussed in more detail in the \nGeneral Discussion.  \nHowever, there is also the possibility that the findings are peculiar to the particular \nstimuli used, rather than being due to their category membership. The within- and cross- \ncategory stimuli differed in luminance, and were drawn from different areas of colour space. It is \ntherefore possible that cross-category search was easier because of easier discrimination of the \ncross-category colours, and not because of their categorical status itself. In Experiment 2 we \nexamined the same effects using equiluminant stimuli from the green-blue region of colour \nspace.  \n 15\n                                                            Categorical effects   16 \nEXPERIMENT 2 \nExperiment 2 was a replication of Experiment 1 in a different region of colour space. To \ncheck that differences in search performance between category-conditions were not due to \nincidental differences between the stimulus sets, the differences were reduced by using stimuli of \nthe same luminance. The within category set were all blue, and the between-category set were \ngreen, blue and purple. The target in both nonseparable conditions was blue.  \nMethod. \nParticipants. \nTwelve observers, (6 men and 6 women; mean age 26 years) drawn from the same population as \nin Experiment 1, took part in the experiment.  \nStimuli and procedure. \nSix colour stimuli were used, three each for the within (blue) and cross-category (green-\nblue-purple) conditions respectively. Chromaticity coordinates (CIELUV) are shown in the \nAppendix (Figure 1). Both sets of stimuli (cross-category and within category) had the same \nlightness (L = 68.75). Target-distractor distance was approximately 20 \u2206E (see Table 1 in \nAppendix). Assessment of naming consensus and the general procedure were the same as in \nExperiment 1.  \nResults and Discussion \nInsert Figure 3 about here \n \nData treatment was as in Experiment 1. Figure 3 shows mean RT as a function of display \nsize for each condition, for target present and target absent, respectively. Search slopes and \noverall percentage error for each condition are shown in Table 2.  \nInsert Table 2 about here \n 16\n                                                            Categorical effects   17 \nAs can be seen from Figure 3, the main findings from Experiment 1 were replicated. The \nlinear separability effect was considerably smaller in the cross-category condition than the within \ncategory condition. The error rate for the within category condition (5.73%) was considerably \nless than in Experiment 1 (19.08%), but still more than four times the cross-category rate \n(1.30%).  Although the search slopes in the nonseparable cross-category condition (23.74 \nms\/item) are not consistent with pop-out, it was nevertheless less than half of the equivalent \nwithin category condition (54.85 ms\/item).  \nThis pattern of findings was supported by three-way ANOVAS (category \u00d7 linear \nseparability \u00d7 display size) carried out separately for target present and target absent trials. For \ntarget present trials the linear separability effect was evident as slower RTs, F (1, 11) = 60.02, p \n< 0.001) and steeper slopes, F (2, 22) = 30.64, p < 0.001) for the nonseparable conditions \ncompared to the linearly separable conditions. The categorical effect was also manifest as faster \nRT, F (1, 11) = 53.11, p < 0.001) and reduced slopes, F (2, 22) = 12.61, p < 0.001) for the cross-\ncategory conditions. The interaction between category condition and linear separability was also \nsignificant, F (1, 11) = 27.05, p < 0.001), as was the three-way interaction between linear \nseparability, category and display size, F (2, 11) = 5.38, p < 0.02, indicating that the magnitude \nof the linear separability effect differed between category conditions: in cross-category searches, \nlinear separability affected RTs and slopes considerably less than in within category searches.  \nThe same patterns were found for target absent trials.  \nExperiment 2 replicated the findings of the first experiment in a different area of colour \nspace. The differences in results between conditions cannot be attributed to differences in \nluminance between the stimulus sets, as this was constant across all stimuli. However, there were \ndifferences in saturation that could possibly affect the results. In both experiments, the cross-\n 17\n                                                            Categorical effects   18 \ncategory sets had lower average saturation than the within category sets. More importantly, \nperhaps, for the cross-category sets, the middle stimulus was the least saturated of the three, \nwhereas this was not so for the within category stimuli. Considering the saturation dimension \nalone, the middle stimulus was not linearly separable from the outside stimuli for the within \ncategory set, whereas it was approximately so for the between-category set. It could therefore be \nargued that the categorical advantage was due to differences in separability in the saturation \ndimension, rather than the categorical difference itself. The target would stand out as the most \n\u2018washed-out\u2019stimulus. Although it is difficult to attend to saturation when hue varies (the \ndimensions are integral; see Burns & Shepp, 1988), Experiment 3 controlled for saturation \ndifferences. Stimuli were chosen so that within-set variation among target and distractors was \napproximately the same for the two sets.  \nEXPERIMENT 3 \n  Stimuli were chosen to limit the difference between the within- and cross-category sets to \nthe categorical difference, as far as possible. Within category stimuli were purple (purple1, \npurple2 and purple3) and between-category stimuli were blue, purple, and pink. In both category \nconditions (cross- and within- category) the stimuli were: at the same luminance; the target-\ndistractor distances were approximately the same; the target was nonseparable in saturation from \nthe distractors; and the target was the same (distractors differed).  \nMethod \nParticipants. \nEight observers (3 men and 5 women; mean age 25 years) from the same population as \nthe earlier experiments, took part. They all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and normal \ncolour vision.  \n 18\n                                                            Categorical effects   19 \nStimuli and procedure. \nFigure 1 in the Appendix shows the CIELUV coordinates of the six stimuli. Target-\ndistractor distance was around 20 \u2206E (see Table 1 in the Appendix). The procedures for naming-\nconsensus and the main experiment were the same as in the previous experiments.  \nResults and Discussion \nInsert Figure 4 about here \n \nData treatment was as in Experiment 1. Figure 4 shows mean RT as a function of display \nsize for each condition, for target present and target absent, respectively, and Table 3 shows \nmean slopes and error rates for each condition.  \nInsert Table 3 about here \nAs can be seen, the findings of the previous experiments were replicated. These patterns \nof findings were again supported by ANOVA (category \u00d7 linear separability \u00d7 display size), \nwhich is reported here for target present trials. There was a significant overall effect of linear \nseparability on search times, F (1, 7) = 35.86, p < 0.002) and a significant effect of category \ncondition, F (1, 7) = 38.46, p < 0.001. Again, therefore, the nonseparable searches were slower \nthan the linearly separable searches and cross- category search was faster than within- category \nsearch. Search times increased with display size, F (2, 14) = 70.05, p < 0.001. All two-way \ninteractions were, again, significant. The linear separability effect was attenuated in the cross-\ncategory condition compared to the within- category condition. This was supported by a \nsignificant interaction between category and linear separability, F (1, 7) = 15.18, p < 0.007, \nshowing that search times were reduced in the cross- category nonseparable searches. Search \nslopes also depended on category condition, F (2, 14) = 8.58, p < 0.005, for interaction between \ndisplay size and category condition) and linear separability condition, F (2, 14) = 32.56, p < \n 19\n                                                            Categorical effects   20 \n0.001 for interaction between linear separability and display size. Finally, the 3-way interaction \nbetween display size, category condition and linear separability was significant, F (2, 14) = 4.42, \np < 0.04, but for target-present trials only. Besides this difference between target-present and \ntarget-absent trials, Experiment 3 showed the same pattern observed in the previous experiments. \nMoreover, the effects cannot be attributed to differences in luminance between the stimuli in the \ntwo category conditions; neither could within-set variation account for the results.  \nGeneral Discussion \nExperiments 1 to 3 suggest that there is an advantage in visual search when the search \nstimuli straddle category boundaries. Even when search was difficult (nonlinearly separable \ntarget and distractors) the cross- category condition seemed to facilitate search: times and search \nslopes sometimes approached values consistent with pop-out (Experiment 1). The findings are \nrobust. They were essentially the same in the three experiments, despite variations in the region \nof colour space and potential confounds in discriminability due to within-set stimulus variation. \nIn Experiment 1, the search stimuli varied in full three dimensional colour space (hue, saturation \nand lightness); in Experiments 2 and 3 they varied in just two dimensions (hue and saturation); \nand in Experiment 3, they were nonseparable in hue and saturation independently, and the target \nwas the same in the two stimulus sets.  \nThe linear separability effect reported in Bauer et al. (1996a) and D\u2019Zmura (1991) was \ntherefore replicated. Further, including conditions that manipulated the categorical membership \nof the search stimuli while controlling for CIE target- distractor distance, allowed us to address \nthe role of categorical information in visual search. The findings suggested that when the target \nand distractors cross category boundaries, the linear separability effect is considerably reduced. \n 20\n                                                            Categorical effects   21 \nThe cross-category condition offered an advantage in visual search, dramatically facilitating an \notherwise difficult task (nonseparable condition). \nOne further potential confound, however, brought to our attention by one of the \nreviewers, refers to the observation that CIELUV space is not perfectly uniform, after all. While \nequating the CIELUV distances between colours should, in theory, control for differences in \ndiscriminability, there still are violations of perceptual uniformity. For example, MacAdam \nellipses (MacAdam, 1942) suggest discriminability differences between different regions of \ncolour space which not appear to be corrected after transformation into LUV. It is possible, \ntherefore, that the \u2018category effect\u2019 observed in our experiments is the result of lower just-\nnoticeable differences (jnds) in the cross-category sets and higher jnds in the within category \nsets.  \nWe addressed this problem by looking at jnd data in the regions of colour space where we \nobserved our effects (Wright, 1941; in Hunt, 1987). We chose these data because they provided a \nlarger number of jnds than MacAdam ellipses do, and thus allowed us to find jnds closer to our \nstimuli. Figure 2 in the Appendix shows the jnds reported in Wright (1941), transformed into \nLUV, in each region examined in our experiments. As can be seen, there is no systematic \nrelationship between discriminability differences and category status of the stimuli. For example, \nthe jnds observed closest to the within category stimuli in Experiment 2 are lower than the jnds \nobserved around the cross-category stimuli; and yet, we found that cross-category search was \nmore efficient than within category search. Thus, even if LUV space did not ensure perfect \ncontrol of jnd differences between the stimulus sets, it seems that our pattern of results cannot be \nattributed to, or confounded by, these differences. \n 21\n                                                            Categorical effects   22 \nIn short, the experiments reported above suggest that it is not only the perceptual \nrelations between search stimuli that affect search performance; category membership also plays \na role. What is less clear is the level at which this categorical advantage occurs, and the \nmechanisms underlying categorical effects. Inspection of the search times and slopes in the \ncross-category conditions, especially in Experiment 1, suggest pop-out, not only in the linearly \nnon-separable condition, but also in separable conditions. If pop-out takes place, then it can be \nclaimed that the advantage in cross-category search is due to the perceptual distance between the \ncolour categories being larger than the distances within the same category, even if the distances \nin CIE space were equal in both stimuli sets. Having tested and controlled for the possibility that \nthis stretching of distances is owing to lower jnds in the region occupied by the cross-category \nstimuli, it can be suggested that the effects reported here are related to colour categorisation. \nIndeed, this warping of perceptual space around the category boundaries would be consistent \nwith categorical perception (see Harnad, 1987). Such an explanation would mean, in turn, that \ntarget detection in the cross-category conditions is driven by the physical characteristics of the \nstimulus itself (bottom-up process). \nOn the other hand, it could also be argued that the categorical advantage evident here is \ndriven by top-down processes which guide attention to the target, thus facilitating target-\ndistractor discrimination (Duncan & Humphreys, 1989). In line with this, it seems possible that \nthe categorical advantage is due to a category code which facilitates search in parallel with the \nphysical code (see Bornstein & Korda, 1984).  A categorical code would assist search by acting \nas a template that prioritises search for the target. With within category, non-separable stimuli, \nsearch is difficult because there is no mechanism that can set a linear boundary between target \nand distractors. When the within category stimuli are linearly separable, however, such a \n 22\n                                                            Categorical effects   23 \nmechanism becomes available, facilitating search (D\u2019Zmura, 1991), but only if the target is \nknown in advance. If the target is unknown, no template can be used to guide search (Hodsall & \nHumphreys, 2001). Here it is suggested that, in cross-category search, top-down guidance is \neven more facilitated as search is driven by a physical, as well as a categorical, code. The \nfindings suggest that the additional coding is adequate to overcome the perceptual load imposed \nby linear non-separability of target and distractors. The additional coding also seems to facilitate \nalready effortless search, namely the cross-category separable condition, resulting in faster \nsearch times. This is also supported by recent findings suggesting categorical facilitation in \nvisual search with one type of target and distractor, and where other differences between the \ncategory conditions were controlled (Davies, Daoutis, Pilling, & Wiggett, 2003).  \nAs already mentioned, the nature of the categorical code is not clear. The fact that visual \nsearch is affected by categorical membership of the stimuli suggests that category codes are \npresent early in visual processing. The fast search times also suggest that it is unlikely that the \ncategorical codes are verbal. Direct labelling accounts of the categorical advantage seem \nplausible in tasks where naming of the stimuli is required or necessary, such as recognition \nmemory tasks (e.g. see Roberson & Davidoff, 2000). In visual search, however, where \ncategorical coding is available early, stimulus naming must have an indirect role, if any, in \nactivating the colour representations relevant to the task. \nIndeed, colour representations can operate at a higher level. They may be semantic, \nreferring to the meaning of colour terms and its associations with other meanings; or conceptual, \nreferring to multimodal, non-linguistic representations based on experiential knowledge of the \ncolours (see Pavlenko, 2000, for a distinction between levels of representation of a concept). \nMultiple codes can be available simultaneously, and dependent upon the nature of the task \n 23\n                                                            Categorical effects   24 \n(Posner, 1978). It is therefore not necessary to assume that performance in the cross-category \ncondition is mediated by colour naming: there is not always a direct correspondence between \nstimulus labelling and performance (Malt, Sloman, Gennari, Shi, & Wang, 1999). \nFinally, the argument for the top-down use of categorical structures in visual search could \nbe strengthened if conditions where the target is known in advance were compared to conditions \nwhere the target is not known (see, for example, Hodsoll & Humphreys, 2001, in the size \ndimension). If the categorical effect were not present in conditions where the target is not known \nin advance, this would lend support to a guided search account. If, on the other hand, a \ncategorically distinct target captured attention even when not known in advance, this would \nsuggest that the category identity of the target somehow altered its physical appearance, resulting \nin its easier detection.  \nThe experiments presented above suggest the role of category information in perceptual \ntasks. To further clarify the origin of the effect, however, we need to address more questions \nabout the way visual search works, and the way categories are used in a variety of tasks. \nManipulating advance knowledge of the stimuli, interference tasks and cueing experiments, \nshould allow us to assess the contribution of top-down and perceptual factors in search \nperformance. Finally, further exploring the relationship between colour naming and performance \nin tasks where colour category information is not explicitly used, should help to elucidate the \nrole of categorisation in perception tasks.   \n 24\n                                                            Categorical effects   25 \nFootnotes \n1.
