This study was designed to investigate possible \nassociations between the two subtypes of AN (Restricting-RAN, and Binge-purging\u2013\nBPAN) and polymorphisms within 5 genes encoding for proteins involved in the \nserotoninergic system.  \nMethods: In order to carry out this investigation we have conducted a case-control \nassociation study on 226 females meeting the criteria for AN, and 678 matched \nhealthy females.   \nResults: Our data show a significant association between polymorphisms with the \ngene encoding HTR2A with both AN subtypes, an association between \npolymorphisms within the genes encoding HTR1D and HTR1B with RAN, and an \nassociation between polymorphisms within the gene encoding HTR2C with BPAN.  \nNo associations were found for any polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter gene. \nThis outcome indicates a substantial and complex inter-relationship between \nserotoninergic genes and AN.   \nConclusions: Given these data we hypothesis that the expression or control of \nexpression of several genes of the serotoninergic system, and interactions between \nthese genes, could exert considerable influence over the specific symptomatology of \nthe subtypes of AN.  \nKEY WORDS:  Eating Disorder; Anorexia nervosa; genetics; serotonin; serotonin \nrecpetor \n \nK Kiezebrink 3 \nIntroduction: \n \nAnorexia nervosa (AN) is a severely debilitating disorder that affects primarily \nwomen (Hebebrand et al. 1996,Elfhag and Linne 2005) and has the highest mortality \nrate of any of the psychiatric disorders (Sullivan 1995,Steinhausen 2002).  Occurring \npredominantly during adolescence (Halmi et al. 1979) the disease is characterised by \na pathological obsession for thinness through the control of eating behaviour. \nEvidence from family and twin studies have suggested that both genetic and \nenvironmental components contribute to the development of AN (Sokol et al. \n2009,Fairburn et al. 1999,Lilenfeld et al. 1998,Vandereycken and Pierloot \n1981,Garfinkel and Garner 1982).  The genetic component has been estimated \nthrough meta analysis of twin studies as contributing up to 76% of the susceptibility \nto AN (Treasure and Holland 1990,Klump and Culbert 2007).  Although no large \npedigree studies showing Mendelian inheritance have been reported to date, and \ndespite the existence of a large number of published genetic studies, the genetic \ncomponent of this complex disorder is still far from being understood.  This is likely \nto be due in part to the relatively low prevalence rate of this disorder.  A further \ndifficulty could be the existence of separate sub-types of this disorder (American \nPsychiatric Association 1994), which are likely to have somewhat different genetic \nprofiles. \nThe serotonin theory of satiety was proposed more than 30 years ago (Blundell 1977), \nand subsequent research by many authors has confirmed the main tenets of this \napproach (Blundell and Halford 1998,Halford and Blundell 2000,Halford et al. 2004).  \nIn general, the release or blockade of re-uptake of serotonin causes an inhibition of \neating, and drugs such as fenfluramine, fluoxetine and sibutramine have all been \nshown to suppress food intake and cause weight loss in obese people (Halford \nK Kiezebrink 4 \n2006,Van der Ploeg 2000).  Fluoxetine has further more been shown to result in \nreduce rates of relapse after inpatient weight gain in Anorexia nervosa (Kaye et al. \n2001).  Considerable research on the serotonin receptor subtypes has implicated the \nHTR1B and HTR2C subtypes in the suppression of appetite (Park et al. 1999). \nAnimal studies have shown that the hypophagia induced by the serotonergic releasing \ndrug fenfluramine can be antagonised by a highly selective HTR1B antagonist \n(Simansky and Nicklous 2002) injected directly into the parabrachial nucleus, and by \npre-treatment with the selective HTR2C antagonist.  The hypophagia induced by the \nsertraline can also be blocked by serotonin antagonists acting on HTR1B and HTR2C \nreceptor (Lucki et al. 1988).  In addition the HTR1B receptor agonist significantly \nsuppressed food intake and modified satiety (Halford and Blundell 1996), and a \nsimilar effect was shown by the selective HTR2C receptor agonist (Smith et al. 2006).   \nThese animal studies were complemented by studies in humans indicating that the \nHTR1B\/1D receptor agonist (Sumatriptan) decreases food intake in healthy women \n(Boules et al. 2000).  The preferential HTR2C receptor agonist mCPP induces weight \nloss over a 2 week period in obese subjects (Sargent et al. 1997).  Taken together, \nthese studies strongly suggest the involvement of HTR1B and HTR2C receptors in the \ninhibition of food intake.  Transgenic animal studies have shown that the HTR1B and \nHTR2C knock-outs cause over-consumption and weight gain (Clifton et al. 2003). In \nkeeping with this body of evidence are specific findings indicating a disturbance of \nserotonin metabolism in eating disorders (Kaye et al. 2005,Kaye 1997).   \n \nMore broadly, in the eating disorders field the evidence for serotonin dysregulation \nhas been intensively reviewed (Brewerton 1995) and several studies have shown an \nalteration of serotonin neurotransmission in AN and Bulimia nervosa even after the \nK Kiezebrink 5 \nrestoration of body weight and or recovery (Kaye et al. 1998,Frank et al. 2002).  \nFurthermore it has been reported that elevated cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of 5-\nhydroxyindoleactic acid (5-HIAA) occur both during and after recovery from AN and \nBN (Kaye et al. 1991).  Studies have gone on to show that in individuals recovered \nfrom AN and BN exposed to serotonin challenges show altered behavioural responses \n(Frank et al. 2001,Kaye et al. 2003,Smith et al. 1999). The serotonergic pathway has \nbeen shown to be involved in feeding, satiety, fasting, mood, anxiety, impulsivity, \naddiction, body image, perception and gender (Steiner et al. 1997,Brewerton 1995). \nGiven the relationship of these behaviours to phenotypic expression it has been \nargued that there is clear evidence for dysregulation of serotonin systems in anorexia \nnervosa (Jimerson et al. 1990).  The reduced dietary intake of tryptophan is unlikely \nto play a major role in altered serotonin metabolism as tryptophan can be provided \nthrough tissue catabolism (Favaro et al. 2000). Over 20 years ago dysregulation \nimplied an inappropriate release or reuptake of serotonin around the synapse, or \naberrant 5HIAA levels in the CSF.  However with the discovery of multiple subtypes \n(between 15 and 19 depending on the criteria adopted) of the serotonin receptor \nclustering within 7 separate families, the notion of serotonin dysregulation has \nbecome more complex and can take many forms. The term dysregulation can now be \napplied to unusual combinations of different subtypes of serotonin receptors with \nserotonin playing a role in complex behaviours through an interaction with multiple \nreceptors. Our approach to the understanding of the subtypes of anorexia nervosa is \nbased on this receptor model of dysregulation.  \n \nSeveral studies have investigated possible associations between AN and \npolymorphisms within serotoninergic genes. There are multiple reports on the \nK Kiezebrink 6 \nserotonin transporter (SLC6A4) gene and AN (Gorwood et al. 2003). Specifically \nresearch has focused on a functional polymorphism in the 5\u201f regulatory promoter \nregion which consists of two common alleles which vary due to a 44 base pair \ninsertion (Long L-allele) or deletion (Short S-allele).  In the S-allele form functional \nstudies have revealed a reduction in serotonin transporter gene expression and uptake.  \nThere has been mixed evidence for the association of this polymorphism and anorexia \nnervosa, an initial meta-analysis of 4 studies revealed that there is a moderated yet \nsignificant association with the S-allele and anorexia nervosa (Gorwood 2004).  A \nmore recent meta-analysis of 8 studies further supported the Gorwood study and \nshowed a strong association with the S form of SLC6A4 and AN (Lee and Lin 2009).   \nA number of studies have examined the role of polymorphisms within the gene \nencoding HTR2A receptors and genetic susceptibility to AN. The HTR2A promoter \npolymorphism -14385G\/A has been shown to be associated with susceptibility to AN, \nalthough this finding is not consistent across all studies.  A meta-analysis of 14 \nstudies suggests that when all data are combined there is statistically significant \nevidence of an association (Gorwood et al. 2003).  One of the possible explanations \nfor the diversity of these findings is that many studies have classified patients with the \ngeneric diagnosis of AN whereas others have investigated the specific sub-types.  \nSince it is likely that different allelic profiles and physiological processes underlie \neach specific sub-type, the use of phenotypic sub-types is likely to be more robust. \nA whole genome linkage study has produced the first report of an association of the \nHTR1D receptor locus with RAN (Bergen et al. 2003).  We have confirmed this \nassociation (Brown et al. 2007).  Of the 4 studies that have investigated the gene \nencoding the HTR2C receptor, 2 have reported positive associations (Hinney et al. \n1997, Nacmias et al. 1999, Karwautz et al. 2001, Hu et al. 2003). Despite the strong \nK Kiezebrink 7 \nevidence for the involvement of HTR1B receptors in the inhibition of appetite, there \nappear to be no studies on the link between AN and the gene encoding the HTR1B \nreceptor (Although it may be associated with low weight in bulimia nervosa (Levitan \net al. 2001). \n \nGiven these data we have hypothesed that polymorphisms within genes encoding \nmajor components of the serotonergic system play an important role in defining \ngenetic susceptibility to AN.  Moreover, it is possible that different patterns of \nserotonin receptor genes could distinguish the restricting from the binge-purging \nsubtypes of AN. In the current study we have performed a systematic analysis of \npolymorphisms within the genes encoding for SLC6A4, HTR1B, HTR1D, HTR2A \nand HTR2C in a single cohort of well characterised individuals with DSM-IV sub-\ntyped AN. \nMethods and Materials: \nSubjects \n226 female Caucasian patients, registered at Yorkshire Centre for Eating Disorders \n(Leeds, UK) between 1998 and 2002. All patients recruited to this study had at some \npoint been admitted to the centre for inpatient treatment however at the date of \ncompleting the study the majority were outpatients (n=176). For each patient \nrecruited, 3 female British Caucasian individuals were used as controls (total control \npopulation n = 678). The control group was selected from a large data base of healthy \nindividuals in the general population collected for comparison purposes in genetic \nstudies. From this healthy population we selected women who were matched with the \ncases for month and year of birth; therefore there was a good match for age and \nK Kiezebrink 8 \ngender between the cases and controls. In addition the controls did not contain any \nindividual with any clinical condition.  Patients were diagnosed according to DSM-IV \ncriteria for eating disorders by a consultant psychiatrist during clinical interview \nbefore being approached to take part in this study.  Diagnosis was confirmed through \nthe administration of the structured interview for Anorexia and Bulimia (Fichter et al. \n1991, Fichter and Quadflieg 2001).  Patients were classified into two groups identified \nas restricting AN (RAN) or binge-purge AN (BPAN). For this study patients had to \nmeet the diagnostic criteria for current diagnosis (i.e. previous 12 months). We further \nextended this to ensure that no diagnostic crossover had occurred within the last 36 \nmonths, but it should however be noted that in those cases where the patient had less \nthan 3 years diagnosis of AN this would not be possible and as such it is likely that \nthey may undergo diagnostic crossover within the next few years. Based on this \nanalysis of the 226 anorexia nervosa patients 122 were characterised as RAN and 104 \nwere characterised as BAN. After complete description of the study to each subject, \nwritten informed consent was obtained.  The study was approved by the Leeds United \nHospital Trust Ethical Review Committee (submission number 01\/085). \nGroup Definitions \nParticipants were dichotomised according to DSM-IV subtype classification. Reports \nof current age, current weight, lowest and highest weight and age of onset were also \nrecorded.  From these data BMIs were calculated (BMI = weight (kg) \/ height (m)\n2\n) \nsee table 1. \nK Kiezebrink 9 \nTable 1: Mean scores and standard deviation of group descriptive \n \nCurrent \nBMI \n(kg\/m\n2\n) \nLowest \nBMI \n(kg\/m\n2\n) \nHighest \nBMI \n(kg\/m\n2\n) \n \nLength of \nED \n(years) \n \nCurrent \nAge \n(years) \nRestrict \n(RAN) \n(n = 122) \n16.45 \n(\u00b12.55) \n13.53 \n(\u00b12.42) \n22.38 \n(\u00b12.88) \n10.9  \n(\u00b18.06) \n28.6  \n(\u00b17.32) \nBinge\/Purge \n(BPAN) \n(n = 104) \n18.1 \n(\u00b13.49) \n14.5 \n (\u00b12.63) \n24.11 \n(\u00b14.11) \n8.00  \n(\u00b16.74) \n27.5 \n (\u00b16.40) \nTable of mean BMI for participants divided by AN subtype along with age on \ncompletion of study and length of time since diagnosis with ED   \nK Kiezebrink 10 \nStatistics \nDeparture from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) in the control population was \nassessed for each polymorphism using a chi-square test.  An exact HWE permutation \ntest was performed if the HWE chi-square p-value was <0.05 and if at least one \ngenotype cell had an expected count <5 (Zaykin et al. 1995).  Polymorphisms with a \nHWE p-value (chi-square or exact) <0.005 in control subjects were excluded from \nanalysis. \nFor each SNP, testing for association between alleles\/genotypes and disease status \nwas carried out using the fast Fisher\u201fs exact test (FET) procedure.  The fast FET \ncomputes exact p-values for contingency tables using the network algorithm \ndeveloped by Mehta and Patel (1983).  \n \nFor each SNP two parameters are calculated: (1) an odds ratio (95% CI) for the \u201cat \nrisk allele\u201d (the allele that appears more frequently in cases than controls); (2) an odds \nratio for the \u201cgenotype\u201d (determined by identifying the genotype that has the largest \nchi-square value when compared against the other 2 genotypes. For example, if a SNP \nhas genotypes AA, Aa and aa, 3 chi-square association tests are performed: (a) AA vs \nAa+aa, (b) Aa vs AA+aa and (c) aa vs AA+Aa.  If test (a) yields the highest chi-\nsquare value, then an odds ratio is calculated for the AA genotype vs the Aa+aa \ngenotypes combined).  In some cases the genotype may result in an increased risk and \nin some cases a decreased risk. Where the odds ratio is below 1 this represents a \ndecreased risk and when the odds ratio is above 1 this represents an increased risk.  \nThe allele data are always presented as the allele which increases the risk. \n \nK Kiezebrink 11 \nOdds ratios (OR) were constructed for the \u201cat risk allele\u201d and \u201cgenotype\u201d according to \nthe formula OR =  (n11 * n22 ) \/ (n12 * n21), where n11 = cases with \u201cat risk \nallele\u201d\/\u201dgenotype\u201d, n21 = cases without \u201cat risk allele\u201d\/\u201dgenotype\u201d, n12 = controls with \n\u201cat risk allele\u201d\/\u201dgenotype\u201d, n22 = controls without \u201cat risk allele\u201d\/\u201dgenotype\u201d. In order \nto avoid division or multiplication by zero, 0.5 was added to each cell in the \ncontingency table. 95% confidence intervals for the ORs were calculated as follows: \nlower limit = OR*exp(-z\u221av), upper limit= OR*exp(z\u221av), where z = 97.5th percentile \nof the standard normal distribution and v= s-allele[1\/(n11)] + [1\/(n12)] + [1\/(n21)] + \n[1\/(n22)]. \n \nPower of the sample \nThe current study examines a population of 226 AN patients and 678 healthy control \nindividuals.  This single cohort represents one of the largest AN case-control \npopulations studied to date and given a minor allele frequency of 0.1 and an expected \neffect size of between 1.6 and 2.6 this study has power of between 77% and 99% at \nthe p=0.05 level. \nAssociation analysis was performed for each of the described SNPs comparing cases \nversus controls; RAN versus controls; BPAN versus controls; and, RAN versus \nBPAN.  \nMultiple testing issues \n \nThe current analysis forms part of a much larger study of 42 candidate genes for \nanorexia nervosa (data to be published elsewhere).  In total we tested 176 SNPs for \nassociation with anorexia nervosa and its subtypes.  Due to the large size of the \noverall study and the number of statistical tests performed, we would expect to see a \nnumber of associations, with p<0.05, simply by chance.  However, given the complex \nK Kiezebrink 12 \nnature of the disorder, coupled with the nature of a \u201ccandidate\u201d gene study, it has been \nimpossible to put an exact figure on how many false positives may have been \ngenerated.  In order to reduce the number of false positives, a semi-conservative  \nBonferroni-type correction has been applied to the data presented here, by correcting \nfor the number of genes analyses in the whole study.  After applying this correction \nfactor, a p-value of less than 0.00119 would be evidence of a strong significant \nassociation, a p-value of between 0.01 and 0.00120  would be evidence of a possible \nassociation. \nK Kiezebrink 13 \nRESULTS \nWe identified 3 polymorphisms within the gene for SLC6A4, 3 polymorphisms within \nthe gene for HTR1B, 4 polymorphisms within the gene for HTR1D, 10 \npolymorphisms within the gene for HTR2A and 15 polymorphisms within the gene \nfor HTR2C which had minor allele frequencies of greater than 0.10.

The findings of the association analysis with \nHTR1D have previously been published (Brown et al. 2007). Significant associations \nhave been demonstrated with genes for 4 separate serotoninergic receptors: genetic \npolymorphisms of the HTR1B and HTR1D genes appear to differentiate the RAN \nfrom control subjects; HTR2C alleles appear to differentiate BPAN from controls; \nand there is allelic variation in the HTR2A gene both within and between BPAN and \nRAN. \n \nA considerable number of previous studies have used the candidate gene approach to \nascertain the relationship between polymorphisms in the gene encoding HTR2A and \nanorexia nervosa.  Most of these studies have reported no association but in the \npositive studies where DSM-1V classification had been applied, an association was \nreported to relate to the restricting subtype.  In the present study, taking the anorexia \nnervosa group as a whole, a case-control comparison demonstrated a strong \nassociation (p=0.0007) with a polymorphism within the HTR2A gene.  Moreover, \nwhilst there was significant allelic variation between RAN and controls, there was \nalso an association shown for BPAN and cases in comparison with controls.  \nConsequently we have concluded that considerable allelic variation in polymorphisms \nof the HTR2A gene exists across the whole spectrum of patients with AN.  However, \nthe occurrence of differences between restricting and binge-purging anorexia nervosa \nsuggests that specific features of this gene not only differ between all anorexia \nnervosa patients and controls but also differ between RAN and BPAN. \nK Kiezebrink 23 \n \nOf the 10 polymorphisms used to investigate the HTR2A gene, 8 did not demonstrate \nstatistically significant associations.  Polymorphism rs3742278 showed significant \ngenotype and allelic variation between BPAN and controls (and between cases and \ncontrols), polymorphism rs985934 demonstrated highly significant genotypic \nassociation between cases and controls. Therefore, depending upon the specific \npolymorphism chosen in any candidate gene study, an association could be found \nwith RAN, BPAN, both subtypes, or neither.  This could account, at least in part, for \nthe positive and negative findings of association previously reported in the literature \n(Klump and Gobrogge 2005). We are aware that diagnostic stability (or rigidity as it \nis sometimes called) is an issue and that diagnostic crossover is a feature in this \ndisorder.  An attempt to ensure this diagnostic stability was made by requiring \nsubtype criteria to have been met for the previous 36 months. However there were \nsome cases in which the eating disorder had not been diagnosed for the full 36 months \nand in these cases there would still be the possibility of diagnostic crossover prior to \nrecruitment into the study. There would also be the possibility in those cases with \ndiagnosis of longer than 36 months that diagnostic crossover had previously occurred. \nIt is extremely difficult to eliminate the possibility of cross-over within the lifetime of \nthe patient, but we feel that we have certainly eliminated the occurrence of cross-over \nwithin several years of the inception of this study.  \n \nA full genome linkage analysis study (Bergen et al. 2003) has, for the first time, \nimplicated the HTR1D gene in AN.  A region of human chromosome 1, incorporating \nthis gene, was linked with genetic susceptibility to restricting, but not binge-purging, \nanorexia nervosa.  We have recently provided a replication of these findings (Brown \nK Kiezebrink 24 \net al. 2007).  Of the 4 polymorphisms within this gene included in the analysis, one \n(rs856510) showed significant genotypic and allelic variation between RAN and \ncontrols, and a separate polymorphism (rs674386) also showed significant allelic \nvariation between RAN and controls.  These findings suggest that further analysis of \nthe relationship between this gene and AN is warranted. \n \nThere is considerable evidence to implicate the HTR1B and HTR2C receptors in the \ncontrol of appetite, and specifically with an inhibition of eating in animals and \nhumans (Blundell and Halford 1998).  There is therefore considerable circumstantial \nevidence for considering that variation in the genes for these 2 receptors could be \nassociated with severe forms of human appetite disorders.  There appears to have been \nno previous reports in the literature of association between AN and the HTR1B \nreceptor gene.  Of the 3 polymorphisms included in the current genotyping analysis, \none (rs1213371) showed a significantly different frequency of occurrence in AN \nversus controls, and this was largely due to an association with the RAN subgroup. \nThis polymorphism showed significant genotypic and allelic variation with the RAN \nsubgroup.  The association between polymorphisms within the gene for the HTR1B \nreceptor (exclusively with the restricting subtype) is consistent with the known \nfunctional activity of this receptor in the appetite control systems.  The HTR1B \nreceptor agonist CP-94,253 inhibits food intake and intensifies satiety in rats (Halford \nand Blundell 1996) whilst in humans sumatriptan, which has a high affinity for the \nHTR1B (and HTR1D) receptor, has been shown to reduce intake at a meal (Boeler et \nal. 1997).  Given this evidence, it is plausible to envisage that some adjustment to the \nstructure of the HTR1B gene, if this caused a change in levels or sensitivity of \nHTR1B receptors, could promote a tendency to food restriction. \nK Kiezebrink 25 \n \nIn contrast to the association of the HTR1B genes and RAN, a quite different pattern \nwas observed for the HTR2C gene.  Here, of the 16 polymorphisms investigated, 10 \nwere found to be significantly and exclusively associated with the BPAN subtype.  \nMoreover, there was also variation of the HTR2C genotypic and or allelic frequencies \nbetween the RAN and BPAN groups.  Clearly, one reason for the significant \nassociations with so many polymorphisms is because these polymorphisms were in \nLD indicating that a sizeable block of this gene is inherited as a complete unit.  There \nis considerable evidence from animal studies that agonism at the HTR2C receptor is a \nsufficient condition for inhibition of food intake (Halford et al. 2004).  Indeed, \nagonists at HTR2C receptors are currently in development as anti-obesity agents \n(Halford et al. 2004).  This account is plausible since the HTR2C receptor agonist has \nbeen shown to decrease appetite and body weight in obese subjects (Smith et al. \n2006). \n \nIn addition the transgenic HTR2C knock-out mouse displays hyperphagic behaviour \nand is obese (Tecott et al. 1995). A further interesting feature is that moderate food \ndeprivation causes HTR2C receptor super-sensitivity (Cowen et al. 1996).  Although \nthree studies have found no association of the Cys-23-Ser alteration of the HTR2C \nreceptor gene and either obese or underweight children (Hinney et al. 1997), anorexia \nnervosa patients (Nacmias et al. 1999), or sib-pair with anorexia nervosa (Karwautz et \nal. 2001) two other studies have reported an association between the Cys-23-Ser \nalteration of the HTR2C gene with low weight in teenage girls (Westberg et al. 2002) \nand minimum body mass index in AN (Hu et al. 2003).  The results of the present \nstudy support an association but also go further to link the HTR2C receptor gene with \nK Kiezebrink 26 \nBPAN.  In the light of the experimental evidence concerning the HTR2C receptor and \nappetite control, an association between polymorphisms within this gene and AN is \nentirely plausible.  The reason why this gene should be associated exclusively with \nBPAN is not immediately clear.  However there exists the interesting possibility that \nthe powerful restriction of food intake in RAN and BPAN patients may be facilitated, \nat least in part, by 2 distinct serotoninergic receptor subtypes; the HTR1B in RAN and \nthe HTR2C in BPAN.  However, this suggestion should be treated with caution.  The \ncomplex relationship between serotonin genes and the expression of appetite, and the \nreciprocal influence of dieting (and nutrition) on the sensitivity of serotonin receptors \n(as discussed by Hu et al. 2003) means that several possible neurochemical scenarios \ncould be envisaged to mediate between polymorphisms of a gene for a specific \nreceptor and the processes underlying the variability in symptomatology in AN \npatients.  An area for further investigation is the link between tryptophan and \nserotonin and the possible mediating effects of tryptophan in eating disorders (Russo \net al. 2007). \n \nThe outcome of this investigation supports the view that a complex variation in the \ngenes from 4 different serotoninergic receptors (HTR1B, HTR1D, HTR2A and \nHTR2C) influences genetic susceptibility across the spectrum of symptomatology in \nAN.  The investigation was driven by a strong hypothesis concerning the relationship \nbetween receptor sub-types in the serotoninergic systems and the clinical expression \nof sub-types of AN.  We have decided to publish the results for all receptor sub-types \ntogether, rather than singly in order to provide the fullest picture of the inter-\nrelationships.  The study had considerable power and the associations (where \nsignificant) high probabilities.  Some of the associations are complex.  For example \nK Kiezebrink 27 \nwith the HTR2A gene different polymorphisms show significant associations when \ncomparisons are made between the whole group of AN cases, RAN or BPAN.  This is \nintriguing and suggests that there is a controlling element in this gene relevant to the \nphenotypic expression of anorexia nervosa. For this, and the other associations seen \nfor HTR1D, HTR1B and HTR2C genes further interpretation would be pure \nsupposition.  Taken as a whole these findings suggest an important relationship \nbetween serotonin receptor activity and clinical symptoms in AN. \n \nAcknowledgments \nThe authors acknowledge the support of the Medical Research Council and \nGlaxoSmithKline for providing financial support of this project.
