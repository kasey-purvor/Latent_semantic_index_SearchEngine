Much of the research has been carried out using excimer\nlasers at an ultraviolet ~UV! wavelength.1,2 However, visible\nwavelength lasers could prove to be more advantageous for\nlarge area electronics due to a higher absorption length in\namorphous silicon and because low cost glass is transparent\nin the visible wavelength but strongly absorbs at UV and\nvisible UV wavelengths.3 Some research groups have dem-\nonstrated laser interference crystallization with the 532 nm\nlaser line producing seed layers for seeded laser\ncrystallization3\u20136 using pulse widths down to 8 ns.7\nMuch of the research to date has been performed using\nexcimer laser crystallization of a-Si:H to produce micro\n(mc-Si:H) or polycrystalline silicon ~poly Si!. The high car-\nrier concentrations and mobilities achieved in mc-Si:H\/poly\nSi means that the films are suitable for active devices such as\nsolar cell or flat panel display driver electronics. In general,\nusing single pulse excimer laser processing at a narrow en-\nergy window around 500 mJ\/cm2 gives super lateral growth\n~SLG! where an average grain size of a few mm is possible.\nIn this case, an explosive crystallization front that nearly\nmelts the silicon leaves behind fine grained poly Si when the\ntemperature drops below the melting point. Since the grain\nsize is limited due to the spontaneous nucleation of crystal-\nlites, Im and co-workers1 proposed sequential lateral solidi-\nfication ~SLS! to overcome this problem. In this case, suc-\ncessive laser pulses are used to melt the a-Si:H, which\nproduces high quality poly Si due to the successive melting\nof the fine grain areas to form large crystalline sizes of sev-\neral tens of microns.\nIn this letter, we discuss the differences observed be-\na!Electronic mail: yew.tang@eim.surrey.ac.uk1860003-6951\/2001\/78(2)\/186\/3\/$18.00\nloaded 13 Oct 2010 to 131.227.178.158. Redistribution subject to AIP ltween single and multiple pulse crystallization of a-Si:H us-\ning a Nd:YAG laser. We show that in our case a new mecha-\nnism, super sequential lateral growth ~SSLG!, produces good\nquality films at very low power densities where, even at 70\nmJ\/cm2, it is possible to obtain single crystal grains of about\n1 mm if a large number of pulses are used.\nThe crystallization process was carried out using a\nNd:YAG laser at 532 nm with a 3 ns pulse width at a rep-\netition rate of 10 Hz. The a-Si:H films used were 100 nm\nthick and prepared by the plasma enhanced chemical vapor\ndeposition on Corning 7059 glass. Standard deposition pa-\nrameters were used, with the gas flow of 40 sccm of pure\nSiH4, at a chamber pressure of 150 mTorr and at a tempera-\nture of 350 \u00b0C with a rf power of 6.5 W. The a-Si:H was\ncrystallized in the near field ~,1 m! with a relatively flat-top\nbeam profile.\nA series of samples was irradiated using a single pulse\nwith varying energy density. Atomic force microscopy tech-\nniques were employed to investigate the surface morphol-\nogy. The grain size and root-mean-square ~rms! roughness\ndependence is shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1~b! shows the rms\nroughness of the surface, which maps the variation seen in\nthe grain size closely as a function of laser energy density.\nThe rms roughness remains at around 10% of the grain di-\nmensions throughout the experimental range. Both of these\nparameters increase proportionately with energy density. In a\nsimilar study using a 532 nm laser line, Carius and\nco-worker4 did not observe any energy threshold. In our\nstudy, however, a clear step-like behavior at around 400\nmJ\/cm2, is observed with a sudden increase in the grain size\nand rms roughness.

Lett., Vol. 78, No. 2, 8 January 2001 Tang, Silva, and Rose\nDownever, it is noted that at the lower energy density ~176\nmJ\/cm2!, an amorphous phase still remains as evidenced by\nthe diffused rings in Fig. 2~a!. The diffused amorphous rings\nare absent in Fig. 2~b! where the single pulse laser energy\nwas increased to 530 mJ\/cm2. In this case, a good quality\nmicrocrystalline silicon film was created. No amorphous\nrings were present when a laser energy density in excess of\n400 mJ\/cm2 was used. A micro-Raman scattering experiment\nperformed on the laser crystallized region gives a well de-\nfined peak at 518 cm21 with a full width at half maximum\n~FWHM! of 16 cm21. The FWHM of a Raman signal from a\ncommercial single crystal Si wafer ~14 cm21!, when com-\npared to the 16 cm21 value, indicates a high quality material\nwithin the micro-Raman beam.\nMultiple pulse crystallization was carried out with en-\nergy densities of 70, 106, and 123 mJ\/cm2 per pulse and with\n10, 1200, and 3000 pulses per sample. A repetition rate of 10\nHz was used throughout the experiments and therefore it\nmay be assumed that the Si molten front has reached an\nequilibrium before being exposed to successive laser pulses.\nThe result of the grain size and rms roughness for these\nexperiments is shown in Fig. 3. In multiple pulse crystalliza-\ntion, the roughness to grain size ratio is close to double\n~20%! that observed with single pulses.\nBoth the rms roughness and the grain size increase as a\nfunction of laser power density as well as the number of\npulses. However, in the three cases considered, the grain size\nreaches an optimum value in excess of 1 mm. A similar\nresult is also observed for the rms roughness, which appears\nto indicate that, in the case of sequential laser crystallization,\nthe lower the power a greater number of pulses is required to\nachieve large crystallite dimensions. This is a very interest-\ning result as it indicates that it is possible to fully crystallize\nthin layers of the a-Si:H in a controlled manner by using\nsmall packets of energy. It also alludes to the fact that the\nthreshold observed in the single pulse crystallization process\ndoes not exist in the multiple pulse process that allows better\ncontrol of grain size formation.\nFIG. 1.

Redistribution subject to AIP lThere is a significant and interesting variation in the\ngrain size and rms roughness when the multiple pulse data is\ncompared to single pulse crystallization. In the case of the\nsingle pulse data, a grain size of approximately 5 nm is ob-\nserved when using an energy density close to 150 mJ\/cm2. In\nthe multiple pulse crystallization process a steep increase in\ngrain size is observed. For example, when an energy density\nof 123 mJ\/cm2 is used a grain size of 500 nm results after 10\npulses. This is significantly larger than if there was a linear\nrelationship between the single pulse growth regime ~where\na crystal size of the order of 5 nm310\u201950 nm would be\nexpected! and the multiple pulse regime. The grain size in-\ncrease is attributed to a SSLG regime. In this case, with each\nsubsequent laser pulse a much faster growth process takes\nplace, probably on the facets created during the previous\npulse until a limiting value or plateau is reached, Fig. 3.\nDespite the rms roughness being significantly higher than in\nthe single pulse case it appears that the large grain growth is\nuniform over the entire region rather than being faceted or\noriented in one direction, i.e., polycrystalline film. The SSLG\nprocess is also observed for the other energies used in the\nmultiple pulse excitation of a-Si:H.\nThe diffraction pattern taken from multiple pulse crys-\nFIG. 2.

Redistribution subject to AIP ldeed obtained as a result of either SSLG or a hybrid SSLS\nand SLG process in the Nd:YAG irradiated films.\nThis result demonstrates that a new mechanism of crys-\ntallization is occurring in the a-Si:H at a laser wavelength of\n532 nm. The interval between successive pulses is long com-\npared to the quench time of laser crystallization of a-Si:H,\ntherefore, the thin film experiences each laser pulse as an\nindividual event, with temperature variations caused by each\nlaser pulse being relatively similar. Mei and co-workers9\nhave postulated that an energy density slightly below the\nmelting point of the a-Si:H could help dehydrogenation and\nimprove film surface morphology. A more recent study by\nCarius and co-workers4 has shown that changes in the thin\nfilm structure occur at 100 mJ\/cm2 with a 8 ns pulse width at\n532 nm. Their research provides evidence that lower energy\ndensities can be used to reconstruct a-Si:H thin films without\nphase changes. From our experiments, we show that the\nnumber of pulses required to crystallize amorphous silicon\nsignificantly affects the quality of film. We postulate that the\ncrystallization model for the SSLG process begins on a thin\nlocalized layer on the surface of the a-Si:H which subse-\nquent pulses use as seed layers to crystallize laterally into a\nthin film. The absorption depth for c-Si ~500 nm! is higher\nthan that of a-Si:H ~100 nm! for a wavelength of 532 nm10\nand the crystallized Si should be able to withstand the laser\npulse once it has reached its crystalline form. The short pulse\nwidth ~3 ns! could create a stressed film and cause crystalli-\nzation to occur at lower energy densities.\nIn conclusion, the multiple pulse crystallization tech-\nnique has provided crystallization of a-Si:H at a relatively\nlow energy density. The surface roughness and grain size\ncould be controlled within a large window. This has potential\ninterest to technologists working on large area electronic de-\nvices such as solar cells and flat panel displays.\nThe authors acknowledge help received from EPSRC\n~GR\/L77638! and Y.F.T. thanks CVCP for an ORS award.\n1 J.
