The expression first flush41\ndenotes these pulses of highly polluted flow at the beginning of a rain event after a42\n2period of dry weather flow (DWF) (Ashley et al., 1993). It is important to know the43\neffect of the first flush through the combined sewer overflows (CSO) and its44\ndownstream impact to the receiving water course. The effect of the first flush is usually45\nassessed by measuring parameters such as Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total46\nSuspended Solids (TSS), Volatile Suspended Solids (VSS) and ammonia. COD, TSS47\nand VSS indicate pollutants released from the sediment bed, which is associated mainly48\nto the particulate phase while ammonia concentrations is associated to the dissolved49\nphase (McGregor et al., 1996).50\n51\nDuring rainfall events, CSOs can bring a substantial quantity of organic matter to the52\nreceiving water, leading to an increased consumption of oxygen (Servais et al., 1999).53\nDegradation of organic matter by heterotrophic bacteria is one of the primary processes54\ncontrolling the oxygen level of aquatic ecosystems and thereby their quality.55\n56\nSuch depletion of dissolved oxygen is typically the main impact of CSO events (Seidl et57\nal., 1998). The degree of impact will be dependent on the sewer type, the rain intensity58\nand the sewage characteristics as well as the properties of the receiving waters59\n(Harremoes, 1988). In order to better understand and model the impact of the60\ndischarged pollutants, it is essential to characterize all the aspects of the wet weather61\ndischarge. In particular special attention should be paid to the biodegradability of62\norganic matter in addition to the usual conventional parameters such as COD, TSS and63\nammonia. Attempts to rely on models for a better description of biodegradation64\nprocesses in rivers influenced by CSO discharges demonstrated the need to account for65\nbacterial biomass (Seidl et al., 1998b).66\n67\n3Conventional quality parameters as COD, BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand), VSS68\nand ammonia give us the quantity of organic matter present in the wastewater. However69\nCOD, TSS, VSS and ammonia do not give a clear indication on the biodegradability of70\nthe released pollutants during a first flush event and consequently they only allow a71\ngross impact assessment to receiving waters.72\n73\nTo quantify the biodegradability of organic matter, it is essential to divide the total74\nCOD into fractions with different microbial properties (Vollertsen and Hvitved-75\nJacobsen, 2001). A conceptual model known as WATS (Wastewater76\nAerobic\/Anaerobic Transformations in Sewers) developed by Vollertsen and Hvitved-77\nJacobsen (1998) using this COD fraction technique has used the oxygen uptake rate78\n(OUR) measurements on batches of wastewater to quantify its biodegradability.79\n80\nIn general research on sewers as part of the urban drainage has tended to focus on the81\nphysical processes from an engineering point of view in order to alleviate and manage82\nproblems such as sediment deposition which reduces conveyance, cause blockages,83\naccumulates pollutants and unsatisfactory operation of the Combined Sewer Overflows84\n(CSO) (e.g. Arthur & Ashley, 1998; Ashley & Crabtree, 1992; Ashley et al., 1992;85\nAshley et al.,1993; Ahyerre et al.,2001). CSO is a hydraulic device for the reduction of86\nflows downstream within a sewer system to reduce flooding and overloading. However87\nvery little work has been published on assessment of the quality of the wastewater that88\nis discharged from the CSOs, in terms of its biochemical processes.89\n90\nIt is important to take into consideration the biochemical processes that occur in sewer91\nsediments as it influences the quality of the wastewater in sewers. OUR measurement92\n4proves to be a way to quantify the biodegradability that occurs in the wastewater due to93\nthe suspension of sediments into the water column. The management of the first foul94\nflush is important since when it is discharged via the CSOs to the receiving water95\ncourse, it can have detrimental effect on dissolved oxygen. The information gathered96\nfrom this work is important as it characterises the biodegradability of the wastewater97\nduring foul flush of actual storm events. In addition the information obtained from this98\nresearch is also able to quantify the biodegradability of the wastewater for different99\nstages of a storm event. All these are valuable information which needs to be considered100\nwhen managing the release of discharges from CSOs to receiving waters.101\n102\nThe objective of this study is to quantify the transformations or organic matter in103\nsewage during wet weather conditions, via characterisation of the storm flush in terms104\nof biodegradability. Then based on this information it would be possible to foresee105\nimpacts posed by the release of first flushes to the receiving waters. Characterisation of106\nthe first flush in terms of biodegradability is the approach used in this study which is107\nbased on the work published by Sakrabani (2004). This opens up a new dimension of108\nthe effects of first flushes to the oxygen mass balance downstream of the CSO.109\n110\nSTUDY SITE, MATERIAL & METHODS111\n112\nWastewater was sampled in Frejlev, Denmark at the Frejlev Research and Monitoring113\nStation (Schaarup-Jensen et al.,1998). Frejlev has a combined sewer system and 2000114\ninhabitants and without significant industries. In the Frejlev Research and Monitoring115\nStation, two autosamplers (ISCO Model No : 67121) (Figure 1) were connected to the116\n1 Supplier address for ISCO : Isco Inc, 4700 Superior Street, Lincoln NE 68504 USA.\n5sewer to collect samples simultaneously during a storm event. The sampling117\nprogramme was carried out from August \u2013 November 2001.118\n119\nOne of the samplers was programmed to take samples for COD, TSS and VSS. Every120\nsample was a composite sample of 5 x 200 ml taken over a period of 10 minutes. The121\nother sampler was connected directly to the OUR instruments and was programmed to122\nfill 4 OUR instruments with a composite sample of 5 x 500 ml taken over 10 minutes,123\ni.e. the first OUR instrument contained a composite sample of the first 10 minutes of a124\nstorm event and the second, third and fourth instrument contain a composite sample of125\nthe subsequent 10-20, 20-30 and 30-40 minutes respectively of the same storm event.126\n127\nTSS and VSS were determined using the APHA (1995) Standard Methods. COD was128\ndetermined using the Closed Reflux Colorimetric Method also in accordance with the129\nAPHA (1995) Standard Methods.130\n131\nThe model concept put forward by Vollertsen and Hvitved-Jacobsen (1998) is briefly132\ndepicted in Figure 2. The model proposes that the substrates present in the wastewater133\ncan be divided into two COD fractions i.e. fast and slowly hydrolysable fractions. These134\nsubstrates are generally large molecules and need to be hydrolysed into readily135\nbiodegradable substrate (SS). During the hydrolysis process, microorganisms present in136\nthe wastewater secrete enzymes to enable the larger molecules to disintegrate and form137\nreadily biodegradable substrates. These readily biodegradable substrates are then easily138\nup taken by microorganisms to support its growth. During the growth process, dissolved139\noxygen (DO) is utilised for respiration and carbon dioxide (CO2) will be liberated as a140\nby-product of this process. Microorganisms that utilise the SS and DO will proliferate141\n6and form new biomass. This model concept varies from the concept applied in the142\nactivated sludge processes in many ways. The microbial decay process is omitted as it143\ndoes not agree with experimental results and also because this process is of minor144\nimportance in sewer systems (Vollertsen, 1998). A concept of maintenance energy145\nrequirement of heterotrophic biomass has been introduced because experiments show146\nthat DO is consumed when no net growth of heterotrophic biomass is seen (Vollertsen147\nand Hvitved-Jacobsen, 1998; 1999). Inert soluble and particulate organic matter are148\nomitted because processes related to these fractions are of minor importance in the149\nsewer system. In order to achieve the COD mass balance, these fractions are covered by150\nslowly hydrolysable substrate (Vollertsen and Hvitved-Jacobsen, 1999).151\n152\nIn order to determine the model parameters and components, experimental procedures153\nhave been developed. The equations used to determine the model parameters will be154\ndescribed very briefly as they are explained in detail by Vollertsen and Hvitved-155\nJacobsen (1999; 2001).156\n157\nEquations for all the components and processes are shown in Table 1, using a matrix158\nnotation derived from the activated sludge modelling. Later in the OUR experiment, a159\nknown concentration of substrate (Sodium Acetate Trihydrate is chosen in this case) is160\nadded to the sample. Acetate is the dominating volatile fatty acid in wastewater and the161\nturnover of acetate is of major interest because its presence in the wastewater influences162\nbiological nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wastewater treatment and the sulphide163\nproduction in pressure mains. Acetate and dissolved carbohydrate are the primary164\ncompounds removed when dissolved organic matter is removed in gravity sewers165\n(Raunkj\u00e6r et al. 1995). In the OUR experiment, acetate is added once the available166\n7substrates get insufficient to support biomass growth. This is essential to determine the167\nyield constant, YH (g COD\/g COD) and qm maintenance energy rate constant (d-1)168\n(Vollertsen and Hvitved-Jacobsen, 1999). The various model parameters were169\ndetermined using the formulas described below and Figure 3 shows the various170\nparameters (such as dissolved oxygen associated with microbial growth denoted as171\ngrowthOS ,\uf044 (g O2\/m3), readily biodegradable substrate associated with maintenance172\nenergy denoted as int,maSS\uf044 (g COD\/m3), readily biodegradable substrate associated with173\namount of added acetate denoted as addedSS ,\uf044 (g COD\/m3)) that can be obtained from a174\ntypical OUR curve which are needed for the equations below.

Standard deviations were calculated as shown in Table 2 and 3.198\n199\nFigure 4 depicts OUR profiles for 4 storm events. These graphs show the time sequence200\nin which the OUR reactors were filled up by the ISCO sampler with wastewater. Hence201\nin Figure 4(a), the first out of four graphs indicate the OUR profile for the first 0-10202\nminutes of the storm event. The subsequent graphs indicate 10-20 minutes, 20-30203\nminutes and 30-40 minutes respectively after the start of the storm event. Generally204\nthese graphs indicate depletion in the initially present Ss followed by a continuous205\nutilisation of Xs,fast and finally the fraction Xs,slow. During the OUR experiment, acetate206\nwas added to measure the values YH and qm. Acetate was chosen as it is readily207\ndegradable and represents a common substrate found in wastewater (Vollertsen, 1998).208\nThe various values of YH, qm and \uf06dh are tabulated in Tables 2 and 3. The general trend209\nobserved is that there is a decrease in the YH values as we progress from start till the210\n9end of the storm. This similar observation is noted for the various storm events during211\nthe sampling programme.212\n213\nHowever the maintenance energy requirement rate constant, qm did not follow any214\nparticular trend. The variation in the qm values is probably because of the great diversity215\nin the micro organisms present in the wastewater and its various kinetics (Vollertsen,216\n1998). Hence qm may vary with substrate concentration and time. The YH, qm and uh217\nvalues were not determined during 30-40 minutes of the experiment because of the218\ndifficulty encountered in measuring these constants due to the OUR curve being at very219\nlow value when most of the substrates were depleted.220\n221\nSeidl et al., 1998b demonstrated that a large proportion of the excess biomass in the222\nrivers which mostly came from a CSO is made up of large bacteria. Servais and Garnier223\n(1993) have also shown that large bacteria have 2 to 3x higher growth rates than small224\nbacteria. These bacteria and other microorganisms tend to have an association with the225\nresuspended particles and may favour settling (Servais and Garnier, 1993). Table 3226\nshows that values for \uf06dh as high as 7.1 d-1 and 6.33 d-1 were recorded during the storm227\nevents.228\n229\nIn the OUR experiments, the duration for the added acetate to be consumed increased230\nfrom 0-10 to 30-40 minutes. Hence in the 0-10, 10-20 and 30-40 minute slot, the231\nduration for the added acetate to be consumed was 4, 7 and 15 hours respectively (data232\nnot shown). This observation coincides well with the figures shown in e.g. Table 4 for233\nthe storm event on 07\/09\/01 where the heterotrophic biomass (XB) values decrease from234\n2.13 g COD\/m3 to 1.21 g COD\/m3. Similar observations were also noted for the235\n10\nsubsequent storm events with a general decline in the values of XB. When there is no236\nnet increase in the heterotrophic biomass as observed in this case, bacteria may be237\nconsidered as grazed and respired by their predators (Seidl, et al., 1998b).238\nTable 4 shows the various OUR coefficients depicting the composition of the239\nwastewater for 4 different storm events. Generally the SS, XB and XS1 values tend to be240\nhigh at the start of the storm event and deplete gradually towards the end. Resuspension241\ndue to additional shear stress exerted on the sewer sediment bed causes release of242\nparticulates into the bulk water column. Consequently there is an increased availability243\nof readily biodegradable substrate, SS at the start of a storm event. The resuspension of244\nsediment bed also causes an increase in heterotrophic biomass, XB which may be245\ninherently present as part of the particulates or XB can also proliferate due to greater246\navailability of SS. The surge in the availability of SS causes an increase in bacterial247\nactivity present in the sediment. The increased bacterial activity aids in the breakdown248\nof the complex substrates that are present in the resuspended particulates to form more249\nparticulate substrates such as XS1. The breakdown process by bacteria can be through250\nhydrolysis by extracellular enzymes and diffusion of the products into the cell (Hvitved-251\nJacobsen, 2001).252\n253\nFigure 5 shows OUR profiles for a set of three storm events from 01-02-1999 till 24-02-254\n1999. During these experiments acetate was not added which is indicated by the255\nabsence of the second peak in the OUR curve. The graphs in Figure 5 also follow the256\nsame trend as Figure 4. This demonstrates the reproducibility of the OUR technique to257\ncharacterise the biodegradability of organic matter released from sewer sediments.258\n259\n11\nFigure 6 shows the variation in the easily biodegradable substrate with the TSS and260\nTotal COD during storm events, which occurred on 21\/9\/01, 15\/09\/01, 07\/09\/01 and261\n04\/11\/01. Easily biodegradable substrate is defined as a sum of readily biodegradable262\nsubstrate (SS) and fast hydrolysible substrate (XS1) whereas the slowly biodegradable263\nsubstrate is defined as the sum of heterotrophic biomass (XB) and slowly hydrolysible264\nsubstrate (XS2) (Hvitved-Jacobsen et al, 1998a; 1998b). The utilisation of the easily265\nbiodegradable substrate gives an indication of the biodegradability of the organic matter266\npresent in the wastewater. For example in Figure 6a, within 30 minutes of the storm267\nevent, the easily biodegradable substrate has reduced from 140 gCOD\/m3 to almost zero268\nwhilst the Total COD and TSS values are much higher and continue to increase until 60269\nminutes after which there is a gradual decline. Similarly in Figure 6b, the easily270\nbiodegradable substrate declines within 30 minutes, whilst TSS and Total COD are271\nmuch higher and reach a peak value at 75 minutes. In general Figure 6 shows that the272\neasily biodegradable substrate is highest at the start of the storm event and gradually273\ndeclines. Biodegradability does not follow the same trend as Total COD and TSS and274\nprovides a good indication of the potential impact to receiving waters when wastewater275\nassociated with initial part of a storm event is released. Easily biodegradable substrates276\nshow that the negative impact of the initial part of a storm event occurs much earlier277\nthan those shown by Total COD and TSS. Conventional parameters such as TSS and278\nTotal COD do not provide accurate impact of the release of discharges from a storm279\nevent and its effect further downstream. The focus of this work was to mainly determine280\nthe impact of the biodegradability of easily biodegradable substrate via CSO discharges281\non water course. However more work needs to be carried to investigate the impact of282\nthe slowly biodegradable substrate. It is not very clear what the impact the slowly283\nbiodegradable substrate may cause further downstream.284\n12\n285\nFigure 7 shows similar trends as Figure 6. In Figure 7, the easily biodegradable286\nsubstrates decline within the first 40 minutes. Total COD takes a longer time to deplete287\nand still much higher than easily biodegradable substrates.288\n289\nThe high biodegradability of the initial part of the storm event can exert high oxygen290\ndemand on the receiving waters. Proper management of the release of the initial storm291\nevent is important in order to minimise impacts on the receiving waters. Policy driver292\nsuch as the EU Water Framework Directive stipulates that all receiving waters should293\nbe in good ecological status by 2015.294\n295\nDegradation kinetics experiments (Mouchel et al., 1997) showed that the degradability296\nof organic carbon was not the same during dry weather and storm event. During wet297\nweather, organic carbon was less degradable than during dry weather, roughly 65% of298\norganic carbon was degradable during the rain event contrary to 78% during the dry299\nweather. When a comparison was made between relative compositions of the biomass300\nduring dry weather along a sewer network, there was a rise in the total biomass and in301\nlarge bacteria. This rise in total biomass and large bacteria during dry weather resulted302\nin greater degradability during dry compared to wet weather. Bacterial growth (in size303\nand biomass) is probably a function of residence time and abundance of appropriate304\nsubstrate. (Seidl et al., 1998a).305\n306\nOne possible explanation for the results on higher biodegradability at the start of the307\nstorm could be that during wet weather when there is resuspension of the sewer308\nsediment, high concentration of particulates occurs in the bulk water phase. These high309\n13\nconcentrations of particulates are broken down by the microbial population present in310\nthe consolidated sediments via hydrolysis to produce fast hydrolysable fractions. The311\ngreater availability of fast hydrolysable (XS1) and readily biodegradable substrates (SS)312\ncauses the biodegradability to be high at the start of a storm event. Figures in Table 4313\nalso show high values of SS and XS1 at the start of the storm event which supports this314\nclaim.315\n316\nIt is important to stress that the initial particulate loading in the wastewater entering the317\nsewer system is important to be considered. In this experiment the background318\nparticulate loading has been addressed by measuring it during dry weather flow319\nconditions.320\n321\nBacteria transported during wet weather mostly originate from the in-sewer deposits322\nand have a long residence time in the system (Servais et al., 1999). Hence these bacteria323\nare more adapted in the sewer environment and readily respond to availability of excess324\nsubstrates during a storm event. This could explain the corresponding high325\nbiodegradability of organic matter at the start of a storm event.326\n327\nCONCLUSION328\n329\nOUR measurements provide useful information in addition to conventional parameters330\nsuch as TSS and Total COD. Information from OUR measurement provides331\ninformation on biodegradability of organic matter which is not reflected by TSS and332\nTotal COD. Biodegradability is highest at the start of a storm event which directly333\nrelates to the greater amount of oxygen utilised to breakdown the easily biodegradable334\n14\nsubstrate. From this study it is now clear that the detrimental effect of first flushes to the335\nreceiving waters is at the initial part of the storm event. Any further input in terms of336\nTSS and COD does not pose a greater detrimental effect due to the fact that the337\nbiodegradability of these inputs is the greatest at the initial part of the storm. The high338\nbiodegradability at the start of the storm event can be attributed to rapid breakdown of339\nsubstrates by microbial population which are well adapted in consolidated sediments340\nduring dry weather flow. The high biodegradability of the initial part of the storm event341\ncan exert high oxygen demand on the receiving waters. Proper management of the342\nrelease of the initial storm event is important in order to minimise impacts on the343\nreceiving waters.344\n345\n346\nList of symbols347\nBOD Biochemical Oxygen Demand (mg\/L)348\nCOD Chemical Oxygen Demand (mg\/L)349\nOUR Oxygen Utilisation Rate (mg\/Lh)350\nqm maintenance energy requirement rate constant (d-1)351\nSS readily biodegradable substrate (g COD\/m3)352\nSO dissolved oxygen (g O2\/m3)353\nXB heterotrophic active biomass (g COD\/m3)354\nXSn hydrolysable substrate, fraction n (g COD\/m3)355\nYH yield constant for XB (g COD\/g COD)356\n\uf06dH maximum specific growth rate for XB (d-1)357\n358\n15\nREFERENCE359\n360\nAhyerre M, Chebbo G and Saad M.
