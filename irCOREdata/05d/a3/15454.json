Introduction\n[2] Continental crustal-scale normal faults typically occur\nas a series of segments of lengths that scale approximately\nwith the thickness of the brittle crust [Jackson and White,\n1989; Wallace, 1989a]. At their endpoints, adjacent seg-\nments interact through a variety of geometric structures and\nmechanical processes. The most common geometry is that\nof overlapping en echelon segments linked through relay\nzones (Figure 1), which transfer displacement between\nadjacent segments [e.g., Larsen, 1988]. These relay zones\nare places of anomalous footwall and hanging wall top-\nography because of the distributed nature of strain accom-\nmodation. Relay zones have attracted considerable research\ninterest, partly because they are critical areas for under-\nstanding how fault segments coalesce to form large fault\narrays, and also because of the possible role they play in\nsediment transport to extensional basins. A number of\nstudies have argued that (1) large catchments occur in relay\nzones and are capable of collecting and transporting sig-\nnificant volumes of sediment from the footwall and (2) this\nsediment is delivered to large fans adjacent to the zones\n[e.g., Leeder and Gawthorpe, 1987; Gawthorpe and Hurst,\n1993; Leeder and Jackson, 1993; Eliet and Gawthorpe,\n1995; Ravna\u02das and Steel, 1998; Gupta et al., 1999; Gaw-\nthorpe and Leeder, 2000]. This model is consistent with\nsome field examples in active extensional basins in the\nBasin and Range, western United States, and central Greece,\nand from the Miocene rift in the Gulf of Suez and has\nsignificant implications for our understanding of extensional\nbasin development.\n[3] Often overlooked, however, in the discussion of relay\nzones and extensional basin development are the dynamics\nof the geomorphic systems that are responsible for basin\nfilling [Bentham et al., 1991]. Mass transfer across a crustal-\nscale fault occurs via a series of fluvial catchments that\nefficiently parse the available footwall drainage area and\nfeed sediment into a set of hanging wall fans. The precise\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 108, NO.

One reason why these processes\nhave not been well studied in many extensional settings is\nthat much of the work on relay zones has focused on older\nrifts, in which the catchments no longer exist [e.g., Gupta et\nal., 1999; Dawers and Underhill, 2000; McLeod et al.,\n2000]. The growing integration of research in tectonics and\nsurface processes over the last decade allows us to approach\nthis problem from a more holistic viewpoint.\n[4] For example, it is increasingly clear that even simple\nextensional fault blocks are complex systems. Because of\nhigh spatial variability in footwall denudation, tectonic\ndisplacements cannot be used as simple proxies for paleo-\nfootwall surface elevations, or vice versa [Ellis et al., 1999].\nLikewise, sediment discharge from catchments in exten-\nsional fault blocks is a function of a number of hillslope and\nchannel processes and is difficult to predict simply based on\ntectonic displacements. In fact, changes in fault displace-\nment rates may have surprising and counterintuitive effects\non sediment supply [Allen and Densmore, 2000]. This stems\nfrom the fact that there are several timescales inherent in the\ncatchment-fan systems, including (1) the time required to\nexcavate the catchments and fully parse the available foot-\nwall drainage area [Ellis et al., 1999] and (2) the time\nrequired for catchments to respond to changes in climatic or\ntectonic conditions [Allen and Densmore, 2000].\n[5] In this paper we attempt to understand how the\nevolution of catchments and fans within extensional relay\nzones is affected by fault array growth. We first briefly\ndiscuss the evolution of fault arrays and the competing\ntimescales of array growth and landscape response. Next,\nwe present the results of numerical experiments that help to\nshow how footwall landscapes develop in relay zones and\nhow sediment is delivered from relay zones to adjacent\nbasins. We drive these experiments with two very different\ntectonic boundary conditions, one in which the fault geom-\netry is static during landscape evolution, the other in which\nthe fault geometry varies continuously. We find that these\ntwo boundary conditions lead to very different landscape\nevolution pathways, with implications for footwall denuda-\ntion patterns and sediment supply in the early stages of\nbasin development. We also find that it is difficult to\ngenerate large relay zone catchment-fan systems in any of\nthe experiments. We consider some physical reasons for this\ndifficulty and illustrate these reasons with observations of\nrelays along several active normal faults in the Basin and\nRange.\n2. Fault Array Evolution\n[6] It is now well established that many extensional faults\nevolve by the growth and mechanical linkage of individual\nsegments [e.g., Peacock and Sanderson, 1991; Anders and\nSchlische, 1994; Trudgill and Cartwright, 1994; Wu and\nBruhn, 1994; Dawers and Anders, 1995; Cartwright et al.,\n1996; Crider and Pollard, 1998; Gupta and Scholz, 2000;\nMcLeod et al., 2000] and that fault evolution has a direct\nimpact on the geometry and stratigraphy of adjacent exten-\nsional basins [Leeder and Gawthorpe, 1987; Schlische,\n1991; Gupta et al., 1998; Cowie et al., 2000; Dawers and\nUnderhill, 2000; Gawthorpe and Leeder, 2000].\n[7] In the initial stages of fault array evolution, many\nfaults tend to nucleate over a broad area, but with increasing\nstrain, en echelon segments experience along-strike\nenhancement of stresses and thus deformation localizes on\nthese segments [Cowie, 1998; Gupta et al., 1998]. Mean-\nwhile, the tips of other growing segments become essen-\ntially pinned, as regions of stress reduction around\nneighboring segments inhibit tip propagation [e.g., Bu\u00a8rg-\nmann et al., 1994; Willemse et al., 1996; Cowie, 1998;\nGupta and Scholz, 2000]. This establishment of en echelon\ngeometry, with deformation localized onto a few major\nstructures, means that segments must continue to accrue\ndisplacement with relatively little tip propagation; thus\nfurther deformation must be accommodated within evolving\nrelay zones between overlapping segments (Figure 1).\n[8] Studies of displacement variation across relay zones\ndemonstrate that these zones are not regions of significant\ndisplacement deficit but rather are areas where total dis-\nplacement is distributed across several fault strands [Pea-\ncock and Sanderson, 1991; Trudgill and Cartwright, 1994;\nDawers and Anders, 1995; Childs et al., 1995; Cartwright\net al., 1995, 1996; Huggins et al., 1995; Crider and Pollard,\n1998], such that the overall displacement on the fault\nsystem tends toward that expected for a single, isolated\nfault [Dawers and Anders, 1995; Gupta and Scholz, 2000].\nInitially, \u2018\u2018soft-linked\u2019\u2019 fault segments, connected by rela-\ntively unfaulted relay zones [Walsh and Watterson, 1991],\nwill give way to \u2018\u2018hard-linked\u2019\u2019 faults as the relay zones\nexperience increased strain and are eventually breached by\ntransfer faults.\n3. Catchment-Fan Development in Relay Zones\n[9] Crossley [1984] and Leeder and Gawthorpe [1987]\nboth described field examples of large catchments located\nwithin low-relief relay zones between adjacent normal fault\nsegments. Leeder and Gawthorpe [1987] went on to suggest\nthat this might lead to large sediment discharges from these\ncatchments, and the deposition of larger-than-normal fans\nwithin the adjacent hanging wall. This association has been\ndeveloped and refined by a number of workers into what\nmight be called the \u2018\u2018large-catchment\u2019\u2019 model of relay zone\ngeomorphology [e.g., Gawthorpe and Hurst, 1993; Leeder\nand Jackson, 1993; Eliet and Gawthorpe, 1995; Gupta et\nFigure 1. Perspective view of a soft-linked extensional\nrelay zone, defining the terms used in this paper.\nETG 11 - 2 DENSMORE ET AL.: LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION AT RELAY ZONES\nal., 1999; Gawthorpe and Leeder, 2000; Strecker et al.,\n2003], and has become almost axiomatic in studies of\nextensional basin development. It is thus important to\nunderstand the general applicability of this model and the\nconstraints on relay zone catchment-fan development.\n[10] The ideas behind the large-catchment model may be\nsummarized as follows: areas between growing fault seg-\nments have relatively low topography through which any\nregional drainage, antecedent to the growing faults, can be\nfunnelled. These areas may also collect drainage area from\nthe back of the developing footwalls [e.g., Leeder and\nJackson, 1993; Strecker et al., 2003]. As the fault tips\npropagate toward one another and as fault segments interact\nand eventually link, the large catchments become increas-\ningly confined within the relay zones, and bend to flow\ndown the relay ramps between segments (Figure 1). Once\nthe fault array becomes fully mechanically linked, the relay\nzones (whether breached or not) retain their large catch-\nments, while catchments in the adjacent footwalls are\ntypically much smaller [Leeder and Jackson, 1993; Jackson\nand Leeder, 1994]. Because discharge of water and sedi-\nment are functions of catchment area, the large relay zone\ncatchments produce large-volume sedimentary fans in the\nhanging wall [Leeder and Gawthorpe, 1987; Gawthorpe\nand Hurst, 1993; Leeder and Jackson, 1993; Gawthorpe\nand Leeder, 2000].\n[11] There is no doubt that catchments and fans in some\nrelay zones do indeed evolve according to this model.\nHowever, there are several aspects of relay zone geomor-\nphology that require more careful analysis in isolated fault\nblocks, that is, extensional settings in which the available\ncatchment area is limited to the local fault footwall. Below,\nwe consider these through the application of a numerical\nlandscape evolution model. We focus on the development of\ncatchment-fan systems in the face of two very different fault\narray growth scenarios: one in which array growth is rapid\ncompared to the time required for catchment-fan system\nevolution, the other in which it is not. We specifically ignore\nthe effects of regional drainage systems that predate the\ngrowing fault array. For simplicity, we also ignore the\neffects of climate change on catchment-fan evolution. This\nis partly justifiable in that climatic variations occur on short\ntimescales (\u0002105 years) compared to the timescales inherent\nin fault array development or landscape evolution, and,\nunlike changes in fault behavior, climatic variations pro-\nvoke a rapid response within the catchment-fan systems\n[e.g., Allen and Densmore, 2000].\n4. Competing Timescales\n[12] A central issue in understanding catchment develop-\nment and sediment transport in relay zones is the interplay\nbetween two very different timescales: the timescale over\nwhich the fault array evolves, and the timescale over which\nthe catchment-fan systems grow and respond to tectonic\ndisplacement. Consider two end-member scenarios. In the\nfirst, fault tips propagate rapidly, and the fault array\nachieves its final map-view geometry before accumulating\nmuch displacement and before significant denudation of the\nfootwall can occur. Thus the footwall catchments develop\nwithin a tectonic displacement field characterized mainly by\ndisplacement accumulation rather than tip propagation. As\ndescribed below, the low tectonically induced slopes and\nlimited available drainage area within the relay zone in this\nscenario will militate against the development of large relay\nzone catchments. Importantly, in this scenario sediment\ntransport and delivery to the basin are largely insensitive\nto the details of the fault growth process, because most\nsediment transport occurs after the overall along-strike fault\narchitecture is determined.\n[13] In the second scenario, fault segment growth is slow\nrelative to catchment development and footwall denudation,\nso that the catchments must respond to a constantly chang-\ning tectonic displacement field both along and across strike.\nStrecker et al. [2003] explored this possibility and argued\nthat such conditions lead to the focusing of footwall drain-\nage through gaps between fault segments. As the faults\npropagate into en echelon geometries, this focusing through\nwhat are, in essence, inherited \u2018\u2018corridors\u2019\u2019 will lead to large\nrelay zone catchments, similar to the conceptual models\ndescribed above [e.g., Gawthorpe and Leeder, 2000].\nWhether or not this process occurs, we agree that catch-\nments in this second scenario will evolve dynamically in a\ntime-varying displacement field and will be strongly sensi-\ntive to the details of fault propagation. We expect that in\nsuch cases sediment discharge to the basin may vary\ndramatically in space and time because of drainage divide\nmigration and increasing displacement rates on the faults\nthat survive the competitive growth process [e.g., Cowie,\n1998; Gupta et al., 1998; Cowie et al., 2000; Gupta and\nScholz, 2000].\n[14] These scenarios are analogous to the end-member\ncases of fault linkage described by Cowie et al. [2000]. In\ntheir case 1, linkage between fault segments occurred\nrapidly, leading to a long but under-displaced fault array\n[e.g., Cartwright et al., 1995] and a broad, shallow hanging\nwall basin with only limited subbasin development. In\ncontrast, case 2 involved fault interaction and displacement\nprofile adjustment before physical linkage occurred [Cowie\net al., 2000], leading to persistent subbasins and a very\ndifferent pattern of accommodation generation. Here, we\nextend those cases to include the development of the sedi-\nment transport systems.\n[15] Unfortunately, field data on the relative timescales of\nfault linkage and footwall denudation are scarce and equiv-\nocal. A few studies have attempted to constrain tip prop-\nagation rates on individual fault segments. Jackson and\nLeeder [1994] used field observations and theoretical mod-\nels to estimate that the tip of the Pearce segment of the\nPleasant Valley fault in Nevada grew by 25 to 50 m\nper earthquake, which yields a tip propagation rate of\n\u000310 mm yr\u00041 given an earthquake recurrence interval of\n103 to 104 years. Morewood and Roberts [1999] inferred a\npropagation rate of 12 to 16 mm yr\u00041 for the tip of the\nSouth Alkyonides fault in central Greece. Both estimates\nfall at the lower end of the range of propagation rates (\u000310\nto 100 mm yr\u00041) predicted by the geometrical model of\nCowie and Scholz [1992a] for Basin and Range faults with\nlengths of \u000350 km. Other investigators have examined the\ntimescales over which individual fault segments grow and\nlink into arrays. Morley [1999] argued that basins along the\nEast African Rift showed little evidence of changes in syn-\nrift fault geometry, implying that the fault arrays developed\nrapidly, before large volumes of sediment were deposited.\nDENSMORE ET AL.: LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION AT RELAY ZONES ETG 11 - 3\nMcLeod et al. [2000] showed that linkage of the >62 km\nlong Strathspey-Brent-Statfjord fault array in the northern\nNorth Sea took 3 to 4 Myr after the onset of rifting. Working\nat one of the tip regions of the same array, Dawers and\nUnderhill [2000] found an average rate of fault tip prop-\nagation over \u000320 Myr of 0.25 to 0.5 mm yr\u00041. They\nsuggested that individual fault segments became incorpo-\nrated into the array over timescales of several million years.\n[16] Our understanding of the time required to develop a\ncatchment-fan system, and transport significant amounts of\nsediment, is even poorer, and comes mostly from numerical\nmodeling. Ellis et al. [1999] argued that Basin and Range-\nscale footwalls, i.e., blocks 10 to 15 km wide in the across-\nstrike direction, with catchment lengths of 5 to 10 km -\nrequired \u0003106 years to achieve steady state relief, implying\nthat this represents the timescale over which the catchment-\nfan systems become fully developed. Allen and Densmore\n[2000] found that, once established, these catchment-fan\nsystems responded to changes in the tectonic displacement\nfield much more rapidly, over timescales of \u000350 kyr. A\nsimilar response time to changes in tectonic forcing over\nsimilar length scales was described by Hardy and Gaw-\nthorpe [2000]. It should be emphasized that these numbers\nare strongly model dependent. They do suggest, however,\nthat complete reorganization of the footwall drainage sys-\ntem is unlikely if the fault array geometry becomes fully\nestablished in much less than \u0003106 years.\n[17] The discrepancies in fault linkage timescales\nbetween different regions may be due to the fact that rift\ngeometry, the initial fault nucleation pattern [e.g., Cowie,\n1998; Cowie et al., 2000], and strain rate may all influence\nfault propagation rates; thus generalization of results\nbetween rifts may not be possible. In the absence of any\nclear agreement on how fault propagation and landscape\nresponse timescales might interact, we use a numerical\nlandscape evolution model to evaluate the behavior of the\ntwo end-member scenarios described above. We show that\nchanges in the timescale of fault growth lead to very\ndifferent landscape evolution pathways, and we point out\nthe difficulty of generating large relay zone catchment-fan\nsystems.\n5. Landscape Evolution Model\n[18] The landscape evolution model Zscape was devel-\noped specifically to understand the topographic develop-\nment of Basin and Range-scale fault-bounded blocks, and\nhas been used to explore the importance of bedrock land-\nslides in montane areas [Densmore et al., 1998], the gen-\neration of triangular facets and other landforms associated\nwith normal faults [Ellis et al., 1999], and the influence of\ntectonic and climatic conditions on catchment denudation\nand sediment flux in simple fault blocks [Allen and Den-\nsmore, 2000].\n[19] Here, we extend the results of Allen and Densmore\n[2000] by considering fault geometries that incorporate\nrelay zones between two en echelon fault segments. A brief\ndescription of Zscape is included here, but full details are\ngiven in the work of Densmore et al. [1998] and Allen and\nDensmore [2000]. The model operates on a two-dimen-\nsional finite difference grid, and each model cell is asso-\nciated with a value of both surface elevation and bedrock\nsurface elevation. The model topography at the beginning of\neach experiment is a planar sheet, gently sloping toward the\nfuture hanging wall, with randomly distributed perturba-\ntions of up to one meter that introduce variation into the\ninitial drainage pattern. Deformation of the bedrock and\nlandscape surfaces is accomplished by applying a three-\ndimensional tectonic displacement field generated by an\nelastic half-space model [Gomberg and Ellis, 1994]. Appli-\ncations of the displacement field occur at a specified\nrecurrence interval, left constant in these experiments, and\nare analogous to coseismic deformation during an earth-\nquake; we neglect post- and interseismic deformation. The\nresulting topography is acted upon by a series of algorithms\nthat simulate regolith production, diffusive hillslope sedi-\nment transport, bedrock landsliding, alluvial sediment trans-\nport, and fluvial incision into bedrock [Densmore et al.,\n1998]. Bedrock lithology and erodibility are assumed to be\nuniform throughout the model space. Model dimensions in\nall experiments are 15 \u0005 15 km, individual cells are 100 by\n100 m, and the time step is 10 years. The model precip-\nitation rate is held constant and uniform at 0.5 m yr\u00041.\nDuring each experiment, the model is run until the footwalls\nreach a steady state catchment relief. Beyond that stage, the\ndetails of the topography will vary, but the maximum relief\nand hypsometry of the footwall remain approximately\nconstant [Ellis et al., 1999; Willett and Brandon, 2002].\n[20] As with any numerical landscape evolution model,\nthere are several parameters in the geomorphic rule set\nwhose values are not physically meaningful and difficult to\nconstrain [see Densmore et al., 1998]. For simplicity, we\nleave these parameters unchanged during the numerical\nexperiments described here. Instead, we evaluate the robust-\nness of the results by running sensitivity analyses in which\nwe vary only the maximum fault slip rate and the model\nprecipitation rate. The fault slip rate dictates the rate of base\nlevel fall and accommodation generation in the model\nspace, while the model precipitation rate is proportional to\nthe rates of fluvial sediment transport and bedrock channel\nincision. Thus these two parameters allow us to vary the\nrelative importance of tectonic and geomorphic material\nfluxes within the model space.\n6. Numerical Experiments\n[21] We show the results of two experiments that differ\nonly in the tectonic displacement fields used to generate\ntopography. In experiment 1, a single displacement field is\nused throughout the experiment and includes two separate,\nsoft-linked en echelon fault segments, both 40 km long,\n15 km wide in the down-dip direction, and dipping 45\u0002 in\nthe same direction (Figure 2). Separation between the seg-\nments is 5 km and overlap is 8 km, similar to observed en\nechelon relay zones in the Basin and Range. The faults are\ndriven by a pure shear extensional displacement gradient\nfield, such that the maximum slip per event on each fault is\n\u00033 m. The recurrence interval between applications of the\ndisplacement field is set to 3300 years to yield a long-term\nmaximum slip rate of about 1 mm yr\u00041. The fault tips are\npinned throughout the model run; this simulates a situation\nin which fault tip propagation and segment interaction occur\nvery rapidly, resulting in the establishment of a soft-linked\ngeometry before the topography can respond. The maxi-\nETG 11 - 4 DENSMORE ET AL.: LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION AT RELAY ZONES\nmum displacement on each fault at the end of the experi-\nment is \u00035 km. Note that, because the fault tips are pinned,\nthe ratio of maximum displacement to segment length (D\/L\nratio) increases during the experiment, to a maximum value\nof 0.13 after 5000 kyr of model run time. This evolution of\nsegment D\/L ratios is comparable to field and numerical\nstudies of en echelon fault arrays, which show that the D\/L\nratio for individual interacting segments may increase to a\nvalue 3 to 10 times that of a more isolated fault [Dawers\nand Anders, 1995; Willemse et al., 1996; Schlische et al.,\n1996; Gupta and Scholz, 2000]. The 15 \u0005 15 km model\nspace is centered within a 25 \u0005 25 km displacement field in\norder to prevent edge effects and to allow for three-dimen-\nsional displacements of the model grid (Figure 2). Because\nthe grid points undergo horizontal as well as vertical\ndeformation, the topography is resampled using bilinear\ninterpolation once the maximum cumulative grid displace-\nment has reached 1\/4 of the 100 m grid spacing. This\nresampling has no visible effect on the drainage pattern\nevolution.\n[22] In experiment 2, we again employ two faults dipping\n45\u0002, but we allow the fault tips to propagate toward one\nanother during the initial part of the model run (Figure 3).\nThe faults begin as short (16 km) segments with 5 km\nseparation and 16 km underlap, so that initially they behave\nas isolated faults within the elastic half-space. The fault tips\npropagate in 1 km increments after every 20 coseismic\nevents; because the recurrence interval is 3300 years, this\ncorresponds to a propagation rate of 15 mm yr\u00041. Prop-\nagation ceases after 800 kyr of model run time, once the\nadjacent fault tips have propagated 12 km; at this point the\nfaults are 40 km long and overlap by 8 km, the same\ngeometry as that used in experiment 1. For the remaining\n5200 kyr of experiment 2 the displacement field remains\nstatic and is identical to that used in experiment 1.\n[23] For simplicity, the tip propagation rate is held con-\nstant throughout the model run, despite observational evi-\ndence and theoretical arguments that the rate probably\ndecreases as the tips approach one another [e.g., Gupta\nand Scholz, 2000]. In addition, we do not explicitly scale\nthe displacement by an expected D\/L ratio, nor do we\nspecify a particular threshold D\/L ratio at which the fault\ntip propagates. However, during the propagation phase of\nthe experiment the D\/L ratios of the faults vary between\n0.003 and 0.02, within the range of ratios observed in\nisolated faults (0.001 to 0.06 [e.g., Cowie and Scholz,\n1992b; Dawers et al., 1993; Schlische et al., 1996]). Finally,\nit should be noted that the elastic half-space fault model\nproduces an approximately elliptical distribution of slip\nalong each fault. Displacement thus decreases rapidly\ntoward the fault tips, which contrasts with the linear\ndisplacement gradient observed and predicted by Cowie\nand Shipton [1998].\n[24] It is important to emphasize that the displacement\nfields used in these experiments are extremely simplified,\nboth in geometry and in temporal evolution, compared to\nreal relay zones. For example, we have not explored the\nsensitivity of our topographic results to different fault tip\ndisplacement gradient patterns [Cowie and Shipton, 1998],\nnor have we evaluated the effects of varying the size of the\nincrement by which the fault tips propagate, although these\nvariables affect the displacement field and are thus likely to\nhave some effects on the topographic evolution of the\nfootwall. Our intention is not to simulate precisely the\ngrowth of a set of en echelon faults, nor to reproduce\nFigure 2.

Faults dip 45\u0002 as in Figure 2.\nDENSMORE ET AL.: LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION AT RELAY ZONES ETG 11 - 5\nthe exact topography of a particular relay zone. Instead, our\ngoal is to compare catchment-fan systems developed in the\nface of two very different tectonic boundary conditions: one\nin which the fault geometry is static during landscape\nevolution, the other in which the fault geometry varies\ncontinuously, albeit in relatively large increments.\n7. Experimental Results\n7.1. Experiment 1: Static Fault Geometry\n[25] The faults in experiment 1 maintain the same over-\nlapping en echelon geometry throughout the experiment,\nand no fault tip propagation is allowed. After 800 kyr of\nmodel run time, rapid base level fall along the inboard and\noutboard faults (see Figure 1 for terminology) has caused\ncatchment incision and fan progradation, especially near the\nedges of the model space where the rate of base level fall is\nhighest (Figure 4a). The relay zone is deformed by displace-\nment on both faults, such that the overall topographic slope\nof the relay is fault-parallel with a slight tilt toward the\ninboard fault. This slope, coupled with the increase in\ndisplacement rate along the inboard fault away from the\nfault tip, produces a strongly axial relay zone drainage.\nAcross most of the relay zone, the drainage divide between\ncatchments flowing toward the inboard and outboard hang-\ning walls is approximately parallel to the strike of the faults,\nand is located quite close to the outboard fault (Figure 4a).\nThus, in the initial stages, most of the water and sediment\nderived from the relay zone are transported axially into the\ninboard hanging wall.\n[26] After 3000 kyr, the model is approximately halfway\nthrough the time required to reach a steady state footwall\nrelief (Figure 4b). At this stage, progradation of sediment\nonto the relay ramp has modified the topographic surface\nslope in the relay zone, so that it is more uniformly fault-\nparallel. This progradation also allows the relay zone drain-\nage to flow around the tip of the outboard fault, causing\nmigration of the drainage divide. A secondary drainage\ndivide exists between the relay zone drainage, which flows\naround the outboard fault tip, and the catchments that\ndirectly drain the outboard footwall. Catchments in the\noutboard footwall experience a higher rate of base level\nFigure 4.

This incision\nleads to two major capture events between 3000 and 6000\nkyr (Figures 4b and 4c). In each event, water and sediment\nthat formerly flowed down the ramp and around the out-\nboard fault tip are abruptly rerouted across the outboard\nfootwall and into the growing fans adjacent to the outboard\nfault (Figure 5).\n[27] After 6000 kyr, the experimental topography has\nreached a steady state footwall relief (Figure 4c). The main\ndrainage divide between inboard and outboard hanging\nwalls has continued to shift over the final 3000 kyr of the\nexperiment due to progradation of thin fans across the relay\nzone. The secondary drainage divide has been completely\ndestroyed by capture events, and the drainage pattern has\nnow reached a quasi-stable state. If the model run is\ncontinued, the individual catchment areas vary, but the\ngross drainage pattern and drainage divide position remain\nunchanged [e.g., Ellis et al., 1999].\n[28] It is important to note that no abnormally large relay\nzone catchment develops during experiment 1. Likewise,\nthe spatial pattern of sediment thickness at the end of\nexperiment 1 shows that there is no correspondingly large\nrelay zone fan (Figure 6). In a series of experiments\ndesigned to test whether this is a robust outcome of experi-\nment 1, we observe this same basic drainage pattern for a\nrange of maximum fault slip rates (0.5 to 2.0 mm yr\u00041), and\nfor a range of uniform, constant model precipitation rates\n(0.5 to 2.0 m yr\u00041).\n7.2. Experiment 2: Propagating Fault Geometry\n[29] In experiment 2, the fault tips are initially located at\nthe edges of the model space and propagate toward one\nanother at a rate of 15 mm yr\u00041. After 800 kyr, the faults\nreach the same en echelon geometry as that used in experi-\nment 1, and the geometry then remains constant for the\nremainder of the experiment. The topography after 800 kyr\nof model run time is very different from that of experiment\n1 (Figure 7a). The propagation of the tips into the model\nspace ensures that, at any one point, the total displacements\nafter 800 kyr are less than in experiment 1, and so there is\nless footwall incision and fan progradation. The time-vary-\nFigure 5. Shaded-relief perspective views of the topogra-\nphy before and after a capture event during experiment 1.

Note that very little sediment is preserved in\nthe relay zone or in the adjacent hanging wall. Most\ndeposition occurs away from the relay, where fault\ndisplacement rates, and rates of accommodation generation,\nare highest.\nDENSMORE ET AL.: LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION AT RELAY ZONES ETG 11 - 7\ning nature of the displacement field generates a relay zone\nin which the topographic slope is directed outward, toward\nthe hanging wall. Thus, in contrast to experiment 1, the\nrelay zone drainage in experiment 2 is dominantly trans-\nverse, rather than axial. The drainage divide between catch-\nments flowing to the inboard and outboard footwalls\nextends between the fault tips, bisecting the relay zone.\n[30] After 800 kyr, the tectonic displacement field used in\nexperiment 2 is soft-linked, identical to that used in experi-\nment 1. Thus, after 3000 kyr, topography has evolved in\nresponse to this shared displacement field for more than 2\/3\nof the total run time. Despite this, at 3000 kyr there are still\nsignificant differences in drainage pattern between the\nexperiments. Figure 7b shows that the gross drainage\npattern in experiment 2 is largely unchanged between 800\nand 3000 kyr. The drainage divide position remains essen-\ntially static and is formed by a ridge that separates two\nrelatively equally incised catchments, implying that capture\nof relay zone drainage is unlikely to occur.\n[31] The landscape in experiment 2 reaches steady state\nfootwall relief after approximately 6000 kyr. By this point,\nthe topography looks very similar to that from Experiment 1\n(Figure 7c). This is not surprising, as the displacement field\nis the same in all but the first 800 kyr of the experiments.\nOnce again, no large relay zone catchment-fan system has\ndeveloped. The key difference between the results of experi-\nments 1 and 2 lies not in the final topography, but in the\nevolution of the landscape toward that final state. In experi-\nment 2, the final 3000 kyr of model run time is charac-\nterized by slow migration of the drainage divide toward the\ninboard hanging wall as thin fans prograde from the relay\nzone and the inboard footwall. Overall, the gross catchment\npattern remains the same throughout this interval. Unlike\nexperiment 1, no major drainage reorganizations or capture\nevents occur, and there are no sudden shifts in the loci or\nrate of sediment delivery to the outboard hanging wall.\nFigure 8 shows the mean fan deposit thickness in the\noutboard hanging wall as a function of time in both experi-\nments. Fans are initially slightly thicker, on average, in\nexperiment 1 because of the more rapid accumulation of\ndisplacement in the initial 800 kyr, but this difference\ndisappears by 1500 kyr and the mean fan thicknesses are\napproximately equal until \u00033500 kyr. After this point, the\ncapture events during experiment 1 cause an increase in the\nrate of sediment accumulation in the outboard fan, relative\nFigure 7.

Thus the loci of sediment\ndelivery to the outboard hanging wall, and the rate at which\nthe fans accumulate, change substantially due to these\ncapture events, despite the fact that the fault geometry, slip\nrate, and climatic conditions have all remained constant\nthroughout the run. Again, these experimental results are\ninsensitive to different values of the maximum fault slip rate\n(0.5 to 2.0 mm yr\u00041) and the model precipitation rate (0.5 to\n2 m yr\u00041).\n[32] In summary, three points are worth noting. First, the\nrate of fault tip propagation (and thus the timescale over\nwhich the fault array grows) has a powerful influence on the\nevolution of the model footwall topography in the first few\nmillion years of landscape evolution. In particular, the\npresence or absence of relay zone drainage capture by\nheadward incision of catchments in the outboard footwall\nappears to be a key difference between the experiments, and\nmay represent a diagnostic tool for distinguishing between\nthese scenarios in real field examples. Second, despite these\ndifferences in the initial stages, the catchment pattern and\nfootwall topography in both experiments eventually con-\nverge to a single overall form in the face of the same\ntectonic displacement field. This suggests that footwall\ntopography may be of limited use in reconstructing fault\narray evolution beyond a particular time window. Finally,\nneither experiment produces either a large relay zone catch-\nment or a large associated fan. This result is directly\ncontrary to the large-catchment model of relay zone geo-\nmorphology described in the sections above, a discrepancy\nthat we address in the following section.\n8. Physical Constraints and Comparisons With\nBasin and Range Relay Zones\n[33] Because large relay zone catchment-fan systems do\nnot form in the numerical experiments, we cannot specify\nthe conditions needed to generate them in isolated fault\nblocks. However, we can use the results of the numerical\nexperiments to identify several important physical con-\nstraints on catchment-fan system growth in relay zones.\nWe emphasize again that we do not seek to understand all\ncontrols on the geomorphic evolution of relay zones, nor do\nwe attempt to recreate the evolution of one particular relay\nzone. Instead, we illustrate these general considerations with\nseveral examples of relay zones in the Basin and Range\nprovince in which these constraints appear to have affected\neither catchment size or evolution.\n8.1. Geometric Constraints on Catchment Area\n[34] Development of large catchments in relay zones\nrequires, first of all, that sufficient drainage area is\navailable. In the presence of active fault slip and base\nlevel fall, footwall drainage area is a scarce resource that\nis competitively divided between neighboring catchments.\nUnless a relay zone catchment is antecedent, thus tapping\na reservoir of drainage area outside of the local fault\nfootwall, its growth will be highly constrained both by\ncatchments in the adjacent footwalls and by catchments\ndraining the other side of the fault block. These con-\nstraints typically result, in the absence of antecedent\ndrainage or lithological variations, in catchments of very\nsimilar size along strike [e.g., Wallace, 1989b]. This\nbehavior is shown by both experiments 1 and 2 (e.g.,\nFigures 4c and 7c).\n8.2. Catchment Growth\n[35] Assuming that sufficient drainage area is available,\nrelay zone catchment growth then depends on the rate at\nwhich the catchment can enlarge itself at the expense of its\nneighbors. Densmore et al. [1998] suggested that the rate-\nlimiting process for headward catchment enlargement in\nBasin and Range-scale fault blocks undergoing active\ndeformation and base level fall was the rate of channel\nincision into bedrock, and that hillslope denudation by\nbedrock landsliding was highly efficient at keeping pace\nwith catchment incision. The rate of fluvial incision into\nbedrock is itself dependent on a number of factors [e.g.,\nSklar and Dietrich, 1998; Hancock et al., 1998; Whipple et\nal., 2000] but is commonly assumed to be a power law\nfunction of catchment area and channel slope (the so-called\nstream power incision rule) [e.g., Whipple and Tucker,\n1999]:\n@z\n@t\n\u00bc kAmSn \u00f01\u00de\nwhere @z\/@t is bedrock incision rate (m yr\u00041), A is\ncatchment area (m2), S is channel slope (dimensionless),\nm and n are positive exponents that depend on catchment\nand channel geometry, and k is an empirical constant that\ndepends on lithology and climate. Various versions of\nequation (1) exist; the rule used in Zscape, for example,\nincludes a threshold area-slope product below which\nsediment transport and bedrock incision do not take place\n[Densmore et al., 1998]. These general formulations are\nsimplifications of the actual physics that underlie bedrock\nriver incision but are somewhat consistent with both\nempirical evidence and theoretical arguments. All formula-\nFigure 8. Mean sediment thickness in the outboard\nhanging wall as a function of time during experiments 1\nand 2. Hanging wall fans are slightly thicker in experiment\n1 before 1500 kyr because of more rapid base level fall\nrelative to experiment 2 during first 800 kyr. Mean fan\nthickness increases more rapidly in experiment 1 after 3500\nkyr due to capture events in outboard fault footwall.\nDENSMORE ET AL.: LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION AT RELAY ZONES ETG 11 - 9\ntions, however, include an explicit relationship between\nchannel slope and bedrock incision rate. By definition, fault\ndisplacement rates and tectonically induced fault-perpendi-\ncular slopes will be lower within relay zones than along\nadjacent footwalls, at least until significant mechanical\ninteraction or full linkage of the fault array is achieved [e.g.,\nGupta and Scholz, 2000]. Thus we expect that relay zone\ncatchments, all else being equal, should be relatively less\ncapable of fluvial incision and headward enlargement than\ncatchments farther along both the inboard and outboard\nfaults, placing them at a disadvantage in the competition for\nfootwall drainage area. This is clearly shown by the pattern\nof catchment-averaged erosion rates (which are limited by\nthe rate of bedrock incision [Densmore et al., 1998]) at the\nconclusion of experiment 1, which are lowest for the relay\nzone catchments and adjacent to the fault tips (Figure 9a).\n[36] A likely example of this behavior occurs in Cache\nValley, Utah, which lies in a relay zone between two active\nnormal faults, the Collinston and Brigham City segments of\nthe Wasatch fault to the west, and the East Cache fault zone\n[McCalpin, 1994] to the east (Figure 10). Maximum relief\nis 1500 m over a distance of 5 km (yielding a slope of\n\u00030.30 m m\u00041) on the Wasatch fault footwall, and 1630 m\nover a distance of 11.5 km (slope of 0.14 m m\u00041) on the\nEast Cache fault footwall. In contrast, catchments in the\nrelay zone have a maximum relief of 1300 m over a\ndistance of 15.5 km (slope of 0.084 m m\u00041). Catchment\nsize in the Wasatch fault footwall is limited by base level\nfall and catchment development along the West Cache fault\nzone. The relay zone catchments, while larger than those in\nthe Wasatch footwall, are not the largest in the area. In fact,\nthe largest catchments are located in the footwall of the\nEast Cache fault zone, where relief and tectonically\ninduced slopes are high and drainage area is relatively\nunconstrained.\n[37] An important corollary of this relationship between\nfault displacement rates, slopes, and headward enlargement\nis that catchments in the outboard footwall should, in some\ncases, be capable of incising headward rapidly enough to\ncapture a large part of the relay zone drainage area and\ndivert it into the outboard hanging wall, as was observed\nin experiment 1. This will result not only in decreased\nrelay zone catchment size but also in decreased sediment\ndischarge from the relay zone, as sediment bypasses the\nrelay and is delivered directly to the outboard hanging\nwall.\n[38] Capture of relay zone catchments is observed in\nseveral relay zones in the Basin and Range, most notably\nin the relay between the Blue Dome and Nicholia segments\nof the Beaverhead fault in south central Idaho (Figure 11\n[Anders and Schlische, 1994]). Here, relay zone catchments\nonce flowed down the ramp between the inboard and\noutboard faults. Incision of two catchments into the out-\nboard footwall has progressively captured much of the relay\nzone drainage area (Figure 11). The resulting morphology is\nvery similar to that developed by the series of capture events\nin experiment 1 (Figures 4c and 5). Again, none of the\ncatchments within the Blue Dome relay zone are signifi-\ncantly larger than those in either of the adjacent footwalls\n(Figure 11). Thus, even if large relay zone catchments are\nable to develop initially, they will be vulnerable to capture\nby smaller, more aggressive catchments in the outboard\nFigure 9.

Sediment Discharge\n[39] As far as we are aware, there are no direct measure-\nments of sediment discharge or sediment flux that allow\ncomparison between catchments in relay zones and on\nadjacent footwalls. The paucity of reliable long-term sedi-\nment discharge measurements from fault blocks in general\nmeans that sediment discharge is commonly assumed to be\ndirectly proportional to catchment area [e.g., Gawthorpe\nand Hurst, 1993; Leeder and Jackson, 1993; Eliet and\nGawthorpe, 1995]. The relationship between equilibrium\nsediment discharge from a footwall catchment at steady\nstate is typically assumed to be [e.g., Whipple and Trayler,\n1996]:\nQs \u00bc Ur 1\u0004 lr\u00f0 \u00deA \u00f02\u00de\nwhere Qs is steady state sediment discharge (m\n3 yr\u00041), Ur is\na spatially uniform rock uplift rate (m yr\u00041), A is catchment\narea (m2), and lr is rock porosity.\n[40] Even along geometrically simple normal faults with\nuniform footwall lithology, the controls on catchment sedi-\nment discharge are likely to be more complex than predicted\nby equation (2), and in particular must be highly spatially\nnonuniform. The underlying reasons for this are that fault\ndisplacement rates decrease both along strike (away from\nthe center of a fault segment) and across strike (away from\nFigure 10.

White lines show the\nboundaries of the footwall catchments. Note that Skull\nCanyon and a smaller, unnamed catchment to the north\n(thick white lines) have captured some of the relay zone\ndrainage area and rerouted it into lower Birch Creek Valley.\nThe largest footwall catchment is located away from the\nrelay zone, in the steep, high-relief inboard footwall, at the\ntop of the figure.\nDENSMORE ET AL.: LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION AT RELAY ZONES ETG 11 - 11\nthe fault trace), and that footwall catchments are subjected\nto displacements in three dimensions, rather than simply to\nvertical rock uplift. Geologic and geodetic data along active\nnormal faults consistently show that displacements are\ngreatest at or near the fault trace, and decrease with distance\naway from the fault [Stein et al., 1988; Anders et al., 1993].\nThus different parts of each catchment experience different\nrock uplift rates relative to some downstream base level,\neven in steady state. Densmore et al. [1998] used this\nobservation to argue that, in steady state, rates of hillslope\ndenudation by bedrock landsliding, and fluvial bedrock\nincision rates, must increase from the headwaters of fault\nblock catchments toward the mountain front. This implies\nthat, for example, parts of a catchment close to the fault will\nproduce higher sediment fluxes, or discharges per unit area,\nthan those in the catchment headwaters.\n[41] The results of experiment 1 agree with this expect-\nation. Figure 9b shows sediment discharge from each catch-\nment at the end of the experiment, once the footwall had\nreached a steady state relief. There is a clear positive\ncorrelation between catchment area and sediment discharge\n(Figure 12), in line with the simple assumptions behind\nequation (2). However, superimposed on this correlation is a\nsecond-order effect that derives from the rate of base level\nfall experienced by each catchment and the position of the\ncatchment with respect to the loci of maximum rock uplift\nalong each fault. Discharge values for catchments in the\nrelay zone are overpredicted by the area-discharge relation-\nship in equation (2), while values for catchments outside the\nrelay zone are underpredicted (Figure 12). For example,\ncatchment 2 (Figures 9b and 12) is the smallest catchment\non the model space; yet it has the highest sediment flux and\nits sediment discharge is larger than that of two of the three\nrelay zone catchments. This is simply due to its location\nclose to the midpoint of one of the faults and the fact that its\ndrainage area is concentrated in the zone of high displace-\nment rates close to the fault. In contrast, catchment 1, which\nis 11% larger than catchment 2, experiences low displace-\nment rates near the tip of the outboard fault and drains\npredominantly lower slopes due to the combined displace-\nment on both faults. These factors result in extremely low\nsediment discharge values (Figure 12).\n[42] The slope of 0.3 mm yr\u00041 in the area-discharge\nrelationship in Figure 12 is effectively a spatially averaged\ncatchment denudation rate, or alternatively a spatially aver-\naged rock uplift rate if the footwall is truly in steady state.\nRecall that the slope of the line in equation (2) is controlled\nby the spatially uniform rock uplift rate relative to some\nbase level. The relative slip rate across each model fault\nvaries from 1.0 mm yr\u00041 at the edge of the model space to 0\nat the fault tip, with a mean of 0.6 mm yr\u00041. However, in\nreality, catchments incise not in response to the relative slip\nrate on the fault but to the rate of base level fall, which is\ncontrolled here by the rate at which the elevation of the edge\nof the model space changes relative to the footwall part of\nthe catchment. Deposition in the hanging wall basin offsets\nsome of the tectonic subsidence relative to the footwall.\nThus, even in steady state, the relationship between fault\nslip rate and sediment flux in these catchments is not\nstraightforward.\n[43] The spatial position of a catchment relative to the\nfault is thus important in setting the sediment discharge. A\nsmall catchment whose drainage area is concentrated near\nthe fault, in the zone of high rock uplift rates, may have a\nhigher sediment flux, and perhaps even a higher sediment\ndischarge, than a larger catchment whose drainage basin\nincludes areas far from the fault with low rock uplift rates.\nConversely, catchments near the fault tips should have\nabnormally low sediment discharges. This effect should\npersist until significant fault interaction or linkage occurs,\nat which time the displacement profile may adjust toward\nthat of a single fault through enhanced displacement rates\nwithin the relay zone [Gupta et al., 1998; Gupta and Scholz,\n2000]. It has been suggested that fracturing near fault tips\nmay locally enhance the erodibility of rocks in relay zones,\nthus increasing the sediment discharge from these areas\n[e.g., Jackson and Leeder, 1994], although this has not been\ndemonstrated conclusively.\n8.4. Fan Size\n[44] Finally, the large size and supposedly high sediment\ndischarge from relay zone catchments are commonly cited\nas evidence for their association with large fan systems.\n\u2018\u2018Large\u2019\u2019 in this context typically implies fans with large\nsurface areas. Following a similar analysis by Whipple and\nTrayler [1996], Allen and Hovius [1998] argued that fan\narea is strongly dependent on fan aggradation rate, which is\nin turn proportional to sediment supply and inversely\nproportional to fault displacement rate. We expect that slow\nrates of fault displacement and base level fall within the\nrelay zone, coupled with the constraints on sediment supply\noutlined above, are unlikely to facilitate the development of\nvolumetrically large relay zone fans. While relay zone fans\nmay have large surface areas, this may simply be a\nconsequence of low rates of accommodation generation\n[e.g., Whipple and Trayler, 1996; Allen and Hovius, 1998;\nAllen and Densmore, 2000]. We suggest that, due to\ninsufficient accommodation, relay zone fans in isolation\nFigure 12. Sediment discharge from the catchments in\nExperiment 1 as a function of drainage area. Solid symbols\nshow the three catchments in the relay zone. Catchment 1 is\nlocated at the tip of the outboard fault, in the relay zone,\nwhile catchment 2 is located on the outboard fault at the\nedge of the model space (see Figure 9b for locations). The\nsolid line shows the best-fit linear regression line. Note that\nthe regression overpredicts sediment flux from the relay\nzone catchments by up to a factor of 4, due to their low\ntectonic displacement rates.\nETG 11 - 12 DENSMORE ET AL.: LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION AT RELAY ZONES\nare unlikely to be volumetrically significant, although they\nmay have large areas. Anders and Schlische [1994] showed\nthat relay zones along several faults in the Basin and Range\nprovince are commonly associated with Bouguer gravity\nhighs in the adjacent hanging wall. They interpreted these\nhighs as indicating relatively thin basin deposits adjacent to\nthe relays. However, it is important to note that such\nanalyses cannot identify the source of the sediment in the\nrelay and thus do not directly address the question of\nsediment supply from relay zone catchments. Adequate\nfan volume and provenance data are required from a variety\nof relay zones.\n9. Discussion and Conclusions\n[45] Catchment erosion and sediment supply in exten-\nsional relay zones are likely to be fundamentally controlled\nby a previously unrecognized competition between two\ndiverse sets of processes (fault array development and the\nevolution of catchment-fan systems) that operate over\npotentially very different timescales. The spatial pattern of\nfootwall catchments and hanging wall fans will be dictated,\nin part, by whether or not the timescale of fault tip\npropagation and fault array linkage is shorter than, com-\nparable to, or longer than the timescale over which the\nfootwall catchment-fan systems develop. In our experi-\nments, very rapid fault growth leads to widespread stream\ncapture of relay zone drainage area, whereas slow fault tip\npropagation, in large increments, does not. We also suggest,\non the basis of the experimental results and simple physical\nreasoning, that development of very large catchments in\nisolated fault blocks is likely to be effectively retarded by\nspace considerations and drainage area competition within\nthe footwall, and that volumetrically large fans are unlikely\nto occur due to a lack of accommodation and possible\ndiversion of sediment onto the adjacent hanging walls.\nInterpretation of these results must be tempered by the fact\nthat many other factors, such as fault slip rate, lithology and\nlithological variations, and climatic change, may also influ-\nence the catchment pattern in relay zones but are not\nsimulated here.\n[46] This difference in catchment evolutionary history\nbetween the two end-member models should result in\ndifferent patterns of sediment delivery to adjacent hanging\nwall basins and hence different ages of deposited sedi-\nments. Experiment 1 predicts that capture events will lead\nto abrupt pulses of sediment delivery to the outboard\nhanging wall as drainage from inboard catchments is\nrerouted across the outboard footwall. Our simulations\npredict that these capture-induced sediment pulses will\nbecome younger toward the outboard fault tip as capture\nevents migrate toward the tip region as the model evolves\n(Figure 5). By contrast, in experiment 2 with a propagating\ntip geometry, no major drainage reorganization or capture\nevents occur, and as a consequence, no abrupt shifts in the\nloci or rate of sediment delivery to the outboard hanging\nwall are predicted (Figure 7). Instead, because drainage\nderived from the inboard footwall becomes etched into the\noutboard footwall during fault propagation, we predict that\nsediment delivery to the outboard hanging wall should\nremain relatively continuous in space and time. Thus a\npotential test of these end-member models, which cannot be\nobtained from analysis of the final landscape, may come\nfrom the sedimentary architecture and ages of fan sediments\nin the hanging wall.\n[47] Our experiments are limited to normal fault footwalls\nthat evolve in hydrologic isolation, without input of water or\nsediment from externally sourced, antecedent catchments.\nHow common are these simple systems in extending\nregions? In the Basin and Range, our qualitative observa-\ntions suggest that most of the actively deforming ranges are\nbounded by discrete, geometrically simple faults, which\nmakes them particularly amenable to geomorphic analysis\n[e.g., dePolo and Anderson, 2000]. There are several\nexceptions to this, particularly in places where the locus\nof faulting has migrated through time. For example, active\nfaulting along the western margin of the Ruby-East Hum-\nboldt Range has migrated westward into the basin [Sharp,\n1940], while the faults along the western margin of the\nTobin Range show evidence of tip propagation and lateral\ngrowth [Jackson and Leeder, 1994]. In both cases, basinal\nsediments are now undergoing rock uplift and denudation in\nthe footwalls of the most recently active faults, and so the\nnew footwall drainage systems may be partly inherited.\nHowever, for the most part, the ranges in the Basin and\nRange appear to have evolved as relatively simple, closed\nfootwall systems, in which all available drainage area is\ncontained within the footwall itself. Regional drainages,\nsuch as the Humboldt River, the Carson River, or Spring\nCreek [Jackson and Leeder, 1994], are typically axial and\nflow between widely separated ranges, rather than through\nsmall-separation (<10 km) relay zones.\n[48] In contrast, basinward migration of fault activity is\ncommonly observed in other extensional settings, leading to\ninherited catchments and incorporation of basin fill deposits\ninto new fault footwalls. Examples of this behavior have been\ndescribed from the southern Afar rift [Hayward and Ebinger,\n1996], central Greece [Leeder and Jackson, 1993], and the\neastern margin of the Gulf of Suez [Gupta et al., 1999].\nGupta et al. [1999] described volumetrically large Miocene\nfan complexes that developed adjacent to relay zones along\nthe eastern border fault system of the Suez Rift. It seems\nlikely that the footwall drainage systems feeding these fans\nwere inherited regional drainages that used the relay zones as\ncorridors for sediment dispersal, rather than relay catchments\nconsequent on fault overlap. Fan complexes at the margins of\nother rift basins, e.g., the Upper Jurassic Brae complex in the\nSouth Viking Graben, North Sea rift system, may have a\nsimilar origin (S. Gupta, unpublished data, 2002).\n[49] It may be that antecedent drainage systems are more\nlikely when such migratory fault behavior occurs near the\nedges of rifts, where a regional basinward slope is present,\nthan when it occurs near the center of rifts or in wide, Basin\nand Range-style rifts. If true, this would suggest that not all\nrifts are alike in terms of geomorphic evolution and sedi-\nment supply, and that generalization into conceptual models\nmay not be justified. For example, the association of\nspatially large catchment-fan systems and with zones of\nfault linkage in the Sperchios Basin, central Greece [Eliet\nand Gawthorpe, 1995] appears to be a consequence of\nregional drainages being focused through topographically\nlow zones of fault overlap. Catchment size in this field\nexample appears to also have a strong relationship with\nbedrock lithology; large catchments at fault overlaps are\nDENSMORE ET AL.: LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION AT RELAY ZONES ETG 11 - 13\ndeveloped on weak prerift lithologies, in contrast to smaller\nfootwall catchments incised into resistant limestones.\n[50] Finally, we return to the issue of competing time-\nscales. If the timescale over which a fault array propagates,\ninteracts, and links is short compared to the time required to\ndevelop an organized sediment distribution system in the\nform of catchments and fans, then most of the basin fill will\nbe insensitive to the details of the fault linkage process.\nConversely, if fault linkage occurs over a similar, or longer,\ntimescale to catchment-fan development, then the basin fill\nshould record many of the details of the linkage process.\nBoth of these timescales are potentially long (up to \u0003106\nyears) but poorly understood. We suggest that most of the\ndata available at present do not allow us to distinguish\nbetween these end-member cases, and indeed generalization\nto all rifts may not be possible. Research into the precise\ntimescales over which fault arrays have developed in a\nnumber of extensional settings is urgently required, as is a\nbetter understanding of the implications of fault growth\nmodels for surface processes, particularly in terms of spatial\nand temporal changes in displacement fields. We also note\nthe somewhat surprising lack of quantitative assessments of\nvariations in catchment-fan morphology near relay zones.\nDetailed three-dimensional (3-D) seismic stratigraphic stud-\nies, such as those by Dawers and Underhill [2000] and\nMcLeod et al. [2000], have shown that, in at least some\ncases, the overall architecture of basin deposits do shed\nlight on the processes of fault linkage. Future studies of\nbasin evolution must explicitly recognize that sediment\nsupply is not simply fault controlled, but requires the\ndevelopment and maintenance of a complex system of\ncatchments and fans, and that this system has its own\ninherent length scales and response times [e.g., Allen and\nDensmore, 2000].\n[51] Acknowledgments.
