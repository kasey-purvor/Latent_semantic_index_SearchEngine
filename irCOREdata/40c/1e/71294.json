By delineating the parallel developments of community\ntheatre and HIV prevention, the reciprocal needs of the practices are assessed in light of certain cases in\nTanzania. This country has taken a leading position in the implementation of sustainable and locally\nowned theatre projects, but the challenges of the AIDS epidemic have proven so vast that the previously\nassumed purposes of community theatre must be called into question. Rather than being viewed as a\nmeans in itself, or a means for rapid change, community theatre is viewed as a relational means in\ncoordinated programmes against AIDS. However, in spite of functioning as an exceptional relational\nagency for the most exposed cohort in the epidemic (women aged between fifteen and twenty-four), the\nsocial, gender and epidemic predicaments will persist as long as policy-makers do not fully recognize\nthe status of young people and the capacity of community theatre.\nSome phenomena are so big that they need to bemade smaller to be fully comprehended.\nThe global implications of AIDS rupture any conceptual definition and cultured\nimagination. It is now clear that it is the most devastating epidemic in recorded history\nand that it continues to plague populations in sub-Saharan Africa who struggle with\nextreme poverty, societal discontinuity and scanty health services.1 Yet the substance of\nthe epidemic is found in a drop of blood, semen or even a tear.2 Reducing the epidemic to\nmicroscopic sizes, however, brings discourses into amise-en-abyme ofmedical taxonomy.\nTo grasp the practical issues of AIDS, a halfway point of view needs to be established,\nfrom which the macro statistics and micro samples coalesce in life-size interactions.\nCoincidentally, that perspective involves scenarios about as big as a theatrical production\nfrom a performance researcher\u2019s point of view.\nIn an ongoing research project on the capacity of community theatre to function\nas HIV prevention, I am combining performance analyses with focus-group discussions\nand interviews paying special attention to two rural areas of Tanzania.3 In the light\nof the complex pathological make-up, social secrecy and sexual taboos, I have found\ncommunity theatre to bemore expressive than clear-cutmedical informationonHIVand\nAIDS, more accurate than epidemiological statistics, and more relevant than scientific\nanalyses of its causes and effects. The syndrome few talk about but most people cannot\nhelp but watch when acted out is a communicable disease primarily in the social sense\nof the word. Its routes of transmission are statistically estimated in vast incidence rates,\n86 johansson How AIDS Changed African Community Theatre and Vice Versa\nbut theatre shows just how complicated one such incidence is for affected people.4\nMedical prevention research approaches the syndrome objectively, but in lack of a cure\ntwenty-five years into the epidemic performances show how biased the impact of AIDS\nis, especially for young women and widows. It is more dangerous to be a housewife\nthan a soldier in Africa. In some parts of southern Africa young women are five times\nmore likely to contract HIV than men.5 In Tanzania, the country I will focus on here,\nthe gender inequity is slightly less striking in statistical terms but still highly significant\nin real-life situations. Theatre is the mode of testimony and dissent that reveals such\ncomplex, biased and inequitable conditions on a community level and, as long as it is not\nfully recognized by policy-makers, community theatre will continue to fail as no other\nHIV prevention dare fail, to paraphrase Samuel Beckett.\nIn this article I will first provide a brief historical background by showing how HIV\nprevention schemes and community theatre projects have been developed in parallel and\ngradually converging trajectories, fromtop-heavyexpert-drivencampaigns tobottom-up\napproaches owned and run by community residents. After that it will become clear what\na pivotal role theatre can play in HIV prevention. But just as the virus has an eerie ability\nto evade a medical solution by mutating, discrete preventive practices are insufficient in\nthe complex epidemic. In light of past and current cases in Tanzania, I will suggest that\ncommunity theatre canmake a difference in an epidemic\u2019s progress only if its ownmodus\noperandi is open to culture-specific variations of the epidemic. Seen as a relationalmeans\nof change, rather than a means in itself, or a means for rapid change, theatre against\nAIDS can be fully appreciated and applied as a participatory prevention practice in an\nepidemic that ultimately hinges on social interactions rather than pills or money.6\nThe development of HIV prevention\nWhy is it that people knowingly engage in sexual behaviour that could lead to a slow\nand painful premature death? Why do the best-intentioned attempts to stem the tide\nof the HIV epidemic often have so little impact? To what extent can local community\nmobilization contribute to a reduction in HIV transmission?\nCatherine Campbell7\nCatherine Campbell poses challenging questions in her acclaimed book \u2018Letting Them\nDie\u2019: How HIV\/AIDS Prevention Programmes often Fail, but offers few answers. The\nreason for this is simply that there still are more questions to test than answers to apply\non the syndrome. Themajor challenges concern the gap between knowledge and practice\namong general populations. How is it possible to prevent life-threatening behaviours\namong people who are aware of the risks (how HIV is transmitted), situations (where\nand when it happens), means (how to protect oneself) and consequences (the slow and\npainful death) ofHIV andAIDS? Themost troubling thing about this question is perhaps\nnot that it is still unanswered, but that it took such a long time to pose to people whomay\nhold answers. Instead of asking questions, so-called experts and aid workers for a very\nlong time brought what they thought were answers to affected people, while it should\nhave been the other way round all along.\njohansson How AIDS Changed African Community Theatre and Vice Versa 87\nHIVprevention campaigns in sub-SaharanAfricawere for a long timepredicated on\nbiomedical information and rational-choice theories pertinent to Northern societies.8\nModels such as the theory of reasoned action,9 the health belief model10 and social\nlearning theory11 are all based on generalized ideas on how individuals attain preventive\nconduct through cognitive, observational or behavioural skills, intended to predict\npositive outcomes of future decisions. The favourite methodology for the models\ncomprises surveys conducted after certain doses of information, sometimes mixed with\nheuristic exercises to inculcate the achieved knowledge. In the 1980s particular risk\ngroups\u2019 knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP studies) were mapped out, followed by a\ndistribution of pamphlets and other mainly written material in information, education,\ncommunication (IEC) campaigns. The most renowned example in the \u2018invasion of\nacronyms\u201912 is the World Health Organization\u2019s ABC model, spelled out as abstain, be\nfaithful, condomise.\nThe problem with the generic prevention models is that HIV transmissions can\nseldom be avoided by virtue of individual decisions or discrete behaviour. It does not\nreally matter what you know or opt for if you do not know who your partner last\nhad sex with and if it is considered unsuitable or even unsafe to ask about it, even\nif he suffers from a noticeable sexually transmitted infection and you are not in a\nposition to say no to sex, or propose to use a contraceptive, since that would make\nhim suspicious of whom you last had sex with, which may well be a legitimate concern\nas that affair may be your only chance to put food on the table for yourself and your\nchildren while your husband is away working, or looking for a job, or spending time\nin his nyumba ndogo (\u2018little house\u2019, a metonym for mistress in Swahili).13 Even if this\nscenario \u2013 pointing to some of the most common routes of HIV transmission in sub-\nSaharan Africa today \u2013 involves stock characterization in a seemingly foreseeable plot,\nits preventive raison d\u2019e\u02c6tre cannot be boiled down to a level of individual decision-\nmaking in a controllable setting. Geopolitical, cultural and ethnic variationsmust always\nbe taken into account as they involve gender roles in social systems that have likely\ndeveloped in other places, times and circumstances than the present. This is one of the\ncrucial challenges in HIV prevention schemes, namely the double-edged understanding\nof culture-historical backgrounds of various ethnic groups and, correspondingly, the\nway their cultures have been geographically displaced and structurally disintegrated over\ntime.14 Some of the driving forces behind gender imbalances and generational clashes\nlie embedded in the historical and political discrepancies of precolonial, colonial and\npostcolonial times. The question is how to cope with them in a viable way today. This\nis, as will be clear below, where the diachronic and eclectic praxis of community theatre\nenters the epidemic scenario.\nIn the 1990s prevention workers gradually realized that HIV and AIDS are not\nmerely a medical, moral or behavioural challenge, but a syndrome which cuts through\nthe cultural fabric of whole societies. Prevention programmes were thus designed\nto incorporate cultural underpinnings and local participation in behaviour, culture,\ncommunication (BCC) campaigns based on interactive processes and tailored messages\nthrough a variety of communication channels to effect individual as well as communal\nbehaviour changes. In recent years community programmes have turned former objects,\n88 johansson How AIDS Changed African Community Theatre and Vice Versa\nor \u2018target audiences\u2019, of projects into collaborating and ultimately self-reliant subjects, a\n\u2018paradigm drift\u2019, as it were, from expert information to grassroots participation.15\nHence the answer to the question of why people knowingly engage in a life-\nthreatening sexual behaviour has little to do with risk factors as such. Solutions must\nbe pursued beyond abstract categories like \u2018knowledge\u2019, \u2018attitudes\u2019 and \u2018behaviour\u2019,\nwhich are only effects of underlying causes. The degree of risk-taking implicated in the\nspread of HIV relates to social groups lacking a livelihood which would allow them\nto make safe choices in life. The most vulnerable group, women aged between fifteen\nand twenty-four, is trapped in a vicious circle where the lack of resources often leads\nto interrupted schooling, early marriages and pregnancies, and ensuing transactional\nsex.16 According to the most recent statistics in Tanzania, 47.4% of all AIDS cases are\nunknown17 and many more women than men are tested (primarily in antenatal clinics),\nbut the existing data nonetheless speak volumes about gender-specific susceptibilities.\nAmong the cumulative AIDS cases in the country between 1987 and 2004, 1.6% of males\naged between fifteen and nineteen were found to be infected, while the same age cohort\nfor females reached 4.5%. Among males aged between twenty and twenty-four, 7.4% are\nestimated to be HIV-positive, while the rate for women is 16.5%.18 When it comes to\nabsolute numbers of people livingwithHIV or AIDS in the period from 2000 to 2006, the\nestimated number is 40,000 for males aged between fifteen and twenty-four and 100,000\nfor females of the same age. The same statistics for persons aged between twenty and\ntwenty-four indicate that 80,000 men versus 220,000 women are infected.19 A similar\ngender deviation is found in surveys of infections transmitted sexually, themain physical\ncause of HIV transmission. About twice as many AIDS cases come frommarried couples\nthan single people.20 These statistics disprove previous notions about AIDS as a medical\nproblem among certain risk groups engaged in certain risk behaviours; rather the data\nsays that AIDS is a generalized syndrome that reveals social issues, in particular for female\nstrata, that have been around for much longer than the epidemic and have to be coped\nwith by means of culturally inclusive and integrated prevention schemes. Community\ntheatre takes on a crucial place in HIV prevention with regard to the mobilization of\nyoung people, gender-balanced programmes and a communal examination of traditions\nthrough past and present cultural practices.\nThe development of community theatre\nWith the acknowledgement of local knowledge as an untapped resource for HIV\nprevention programmes, a mixed practice of culture-specific conflict- and problem-\nsolving leads into the AIDS scenario: community theatre (a generic label with cognate\nvariants such as Theatre for Development, popular theatre, theatre for change, applied\ntheatre, social drama etc.). African community theatre, signifying a syncretic mix of\ntraditional and contemporary modes of performance, has been used in various forms\nand for various purposes since precolonial times. Quite a few reports and books have\nbeen written about theatre as a developmental phenomenon.21 Some researchers hold\ndoubts about the potential of applied theatre as an instrument for social reform,22 while\nothers tend to be overly optimistic about its capacity to instigate social changes.23 A few\njohansson How AIDS Changed African Community Theatre and Vice Versa 89\nstudies have put community theatre in relation to AIDS, but they are either out of date24\nor limited in scope,25 or lack epidemiological pertinence on a communal and interactive\nlevel.26 The most probing texts on theatre and AIDS have been written in the form of\nreports by researchers and outreach workers such as Augustin Hatar.27\nIn the 1960s, the decade of independence in most African countries, the so-\ncalled \u2018travelling-theatre movements\u2019 were deployed by university scholars aiming for\ncultural revitalization.28 European-style \u2018well-made plays\u2019 toured and became a mobile\nvehicle geared towards rural audiences by university-based African artists. Like most\ndevelopment workers at the time, however, the plays did not pay a great deal of attention\nto local traditions or languages, let alone the gender issues that lurked behind societal\npredicaments.\nIn a second phase, theatre projects were brought closer to their target audiences.\nIn 1974 the Laedza Batanani movement was launched in Botswana, marking the start\nof so-called \u2018Theatre for Development\u2019. This was also an academic project with built-\nin problems of involving local audiences in projects about communal challenges, but\nunder the influence of Paulo Freire\u2019s \u2018pedagogy of the oppressed\u2019 project facilitators paid\nincreasing attention to situational and political conditions.29 About the same time, the\nAhmadu Bello University in Zaira, Nigeria, took on similar projects, now also inspired\nby Augusto Boal\u2019s \u2018theatre of the oppressed\u2019.30 Artistic outreach workers dwelled amid\nvillagers or urban squatters, composed skits and role-plays based on characters and\nscenarios as narrated by the locals, performed the result for them, and then invited\nthe audience to alter the resolution of plots by way of simultaneous dramaturgy and\npost-performance discussions.\nThe development of community theatre spread across Africa via international\nworkshops and eventually led to a third phase of community theatre, elaborated in\ncountries such as Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Tanzania.31 At this point most of the creative\nand edifying modus operandi was entrusted the community subjects themselves, who\nparticipated directly in the planning and performing of the theatre. Community theatre\nwent from being a social event to becoming a social process.\nThe third phase of community theatre coincides with the outbreak of the AIDS\nepidemic and yet it would take many years before the full potential of theatre projects\nwould be employed in prevention programmes. When the first community-owned\ntheatre projects were tried out in Tanzania in the 1980s, aid organizations such as WHO\ncirculated Northern-style information and education on how the epidemic occurred,\nwhile religious organizations took care of the moral explanation of why it occurred.32\nNot until the recognition of culture-specific communication in the 1990s would people\u2019s\nlocal knowledge and practices have a bearing on programmes dealing with their own\npredicaments.\nWhat, then, were the advantages of community theatre? First of all it appealed to and\nmobilized the most susceptible epidemic cohorts, men and women aged between fifteen\nand twenty-four, who suddenly were wanted as aid workers in the most important\nprojects in Africa. (When I meet youth groups, I usually tell them that they are\ninvolved with the most important job in the world and that I am visiting them to\nlook, listen and learn.) In their formative years, youths usually also have a chance to\n90 johansson How AIDS Changed African Community Theatre and Vice Versa\nalter traditional gender roles before being fashioned into normal citizens. Moreover,\ncommunity theatre taps into the local traditions of ritual, dance, poetic, story-telling\nand dialogue-based performances, and combines these with contemporary modes of\npedagogy and interactive theatre. At an initial stage of projects, groups are given funds\nat least for the pilot phase, including training by artistic facilitators and health-care\npersonnel. Performance skills are then combined with analytical components like body\nand community mapping, a non-linguistic scrutiny of intimate and societal risk factors.\nScenarios are discussed, preferably in gender-divided groups, before being rehearsed\nand performed in public meeting-places. This is yet another advantage with community\ntheatre as HIV prevention, namely that young people are able to break the silence\non taboo-laden issues of sexuality, sickness and death before and with audiences that\nhave gradually become willing to ventilate their own private views in post-performance\ndiscussions.With the help of good drama instructors the plays are followed by \u2018joker\u2019-led\ndiscussions as intricate as the plays themselves. With the help of good donors and local\npoliticians the projects may even be enhanced by sustainable follow-up programmes.\nThis is all too rare, though, and an issue that I will resume towards the end of this\nessay.\nHence the crucial activities of the social process are the performances which take\nplace in public hubs such as marketplaces, schoolyards or traditional meeting grounds.\nThe events are commonly announcedwithhardbeats ondrumsaccompaniedbywhistles,\nhorns or shouts, which, in turn, prompt a dance that community residents can take part\nin. I have seen about a hundred performances in rural African settings and at almost\nevery occasion a decent number of spectators have turned up spontaneously. After the\ninitial dances, the theme of the theatre is announced by the group leader. The mere\nword ukimwi (AIDS) may scare off a fraction of the crowd, but more often it sharpens\nthe attention of the bystanders.33 Short plays follow, resembling the comical verve in\nthe tradition of Roman farce, commedia dell\u2019arte, Molie`re and Dario Fo. The actions are\nbased on improvisation influenced by local dialects, jokes and performance styles. When\nfamiliar characters are portrayed as villains in intrigues that everybody knows all too\nwell, a peculiar alienation effect kicks in, which can be sensed like an uncanny echo after\nthe roaring laughter. The conflicting emotions thus prompt the need for a communal\nmeeting after the high-spirited events.\nThe worth of an effective social mobilization of key epidemic risk groups, of a\nculture-specific employment of prevention practices, and of a persuasive appeal to the\nlarge numbers of local residents, made community theatre a serious factor in the fight\nagainst AIDS in Tanzania and several other African countries. There are good reasons\nto assume that it has had at least a contributing effect in three sub-Saharan areas with\nepidemic declines, namely Uganda and the Tanzanian regions of Kagera and Mbeya.34\nAfter looking at, listening to and learning from theatre groups in five African countries\nover the past four years, I am convinced that community theatre potentially is the most\nefficient form of HIV prevention for young people. I am equally convinced that it is the\nleast efficiently used form of HIV prevention.35 This has to do not only with money-\ndriven non-governmental organizations, religiously myopic patrons or corrupt local\npoliticians, but also with the theatre practitioners and researchers themselves. To clarify\njohansson How AIDS Changed African Community Theatre and Vice Versa 91\nthe misuse of community theatre, I wish to revisit a theatre project in Tanzania which\ntook place in 1982 and 1983, when the third phase of community theatre was established\nand the first AIDS cases in the country were detected.\nThe reproductive misfortune of Zakia\nThe seminal \u2018Malya popular theatre project\u2019 got its name after a village in Mwanza\nregion at the southern tip of Lake Victoria in Tanzania. It lasted for more than a year\nand epitomized what Penina Mlama calls the \u2018Tanzanian model\u2019 of popular theatre.36\nWhat made the project unique, according to Mlama, was that (1) community members\nparticipated in all stages, from the social mobilization to the resulting follow-up actions,\n(2) the elements of the projects emanated not frompreconceived ideas but localmodes of\ndiscourse and performance, and (3) it drew on an already established nationalmovement\nof dance and theatre in Tanzania.37\nIn her book Culture and Development (1991), Mlama opens with an intricate\npan-African background to her work. Colonial history and Western capitalist\ncontemporaneity are blamed for Africa\u2019s macro political problems, while European\nmissionaries are liable for imposing a culture of silence through implementations of\nChristian doctrines onto themicro political grassroots. These ideological contraventions\nhave had repercussions in postcolonial times through autocratic African politics as\nwell as top-down Western development programmes. In the same breath, however,\nMlama celebrates the Chinese Cultural Revolution as an exemplary social mobilization\nand uprising, a propagandist delusion promoted by Tanzanian authorities in Mlama\u2019s\nformative years as an artist.38 In order to infuse an independent spirit in Tanzanians\nMlama puts faith in the ideological role of precolonial performances. This was a\ntime when \u2018children [sat] by their grandmothers\u2019 feet\u2019 on \u2018moonlit nights\u2019 and got\n\u2018entertained and educated\u2019 by performances that served as \u2018a tool for instruction and\ntransmission of knowledge, values and attitudes in initiation rites, marriage, death,\nreligious rituals or public forums for behavioural appraisal, criticism and control\u2019.39\nWith apseudo-Brechtian stance against entertainment,Mlamaargues for an ideologically\nconscious theatre in schools and other public institutions and spheres, but comes to the\nrealization that Tanzanian authorities were and are rather indifferent to theatre except\nas a mouthpiece for the ruling party.40\nThe Malya project took on the burning issue of schoolgirl pregnancies with\ntriggering factors such as poverty, male-dominated schooling, political corruption and\nthe ensuing premature marriages, divorces and prostitution.41 It is interesting to reread\nMlama\u2019s book in light of the AIDS epidemic for two reasons: first, because the first cases\nof AIDS-related deaths were recorded in Tanzania in the bordering Kagera region at the\nvery time ofMlama\u2019s project42 and, second, because the project dramatized predicaments\nassociated with social life in general and gender in particular which have later been dealt\nwith as key epidemic risk factors. A performance that took place in 1982 about the\nschoolgirl Zakia, her friend Josephine and the businessman Mandanganya is a telling\ncase in point.\n92 johansson How AIDS Changed African Community Theatre and Vice Versa\nHe gives her presents and Zakia agrees to meet him. Zakia takes the presents home and\nsneaks out to go and meet the businessman. She returns to find that her mother has\ndiscovered the gifts. Zakia lies that the gifts belong to Josephine. Josephine comes to\nsay hello to Zakia but is reprimanded by Zakia\u2019s parents for corrupting Zakia. Then\nJosephine discovers that Zakia has taken away her boyfriend, so when the parents leave\nthe two start fighting. The unemployed boys come to pacify them and offer to sell the\ngifts at the black market. In the next scene it is discovered that Zakia is pregnant but the\nbusinessman refuses to take responsibility. Josephine is also pregnant and is subjected\nto the same treatment by the businessman. Zakia\u2019s parents take Mandanganya to court\nbut he gets away with a very light sentence because he bribes the judge. The parents are\ninfuriated and decide to seek justice at the village council. The play ended here because\nthis became the entry point for the post-performance discussion with the audience on\nthe issues raised.43\nThe discussion that followed this performance is still going on in Tanzania twenty-\nfive years after the event, but now with even greater urgency as it involves directly life-\nthreatening calamities and not \u2018only\u2019 enduring poverty, inequity and social alienation.\nHowever, at the time of the Malya project epidemic issues were already embedded in\nthe scenarios, albeit tacitly. In the section cited above, Mlama mentions the unemployed\nboys\u2019 dealing with goods on the black market. This trade cut across the borders of\nTanzania, Uganda and Kenya following a war between the former two countries and a\nsevere economic crisis for all three countries by the end of the 1970s. The blackmarketwas\noperated by young males relying \u2018for food, drink and sexual services, on cafe\u00b4s, teashops,\nand bars, largely run bywomen\u2019.44 The grim historical irony is that Zakia, after becoming\npregnant and abandoned by Mandanganya, barred from her school (pregnant female\npupils still get expelled without discretion) and probably driven away from home by her\npoor parents, quite likely ended up as a barmaid at a time when fishermen, truck drivers\nand racketeers carried the looming epidemic across and around Lake Victoria.\nThe post-performance discussion in Malya also forestalled topical debates on\nAIDS by relating schoolgirl pregnancies to the paradoxical stance of, on the one hand,\nreproachingyouth for their drinkinghabits, badworkmorals anddisrespect for traditions\nthat used to prohibit promiscuous lifestyles, and, on the other, acknowledging the\nfailure of the community and parents to supervise the youth, let alone engage them\nin income-generating activities or other meaningful initiatives.45 In the early stages of\nthe project parents thought that the girls, especially, would be corrupted by participating\nin the theatre. Furthermore, the village core group got into trouble with the African\nInlandChurch, who protested against theatrical depictions counter toChristian conduct.\nThe dispute was eventually toned down as the church admitted that the performances\nreflected realistic rather than sinful scenarios. A much more serious critique arose when\nthe misbehaviour of the village leadership itself was divulged. The village chairman\nwas forced to resign after it became known that both he \u2018and the secretary had been\nresponsible for several unwanted pregnancies in the village\u2019.46\nWhen it comes to epidemic risk factors, two phenomena were anticipated in\nthe Malya performance. One was the \u2018sugar daddy\u2019 dilemma, i.e. transactional sexual\njohansson How AIDS Changed African Community Theatre and Vice Versa 93\nrelations between young females and older men with cash or alluring gifts (e.g. clothes,\njewellery, holidays).This still poses awidespread risk in today\u2019sAIDSepidemic.47 Another\nepidemic topic is corruption, a vast problem that not only conserves political pecking\norders but also discriminates against people in terms of gender, class and ethnicity.\nThe combination of poverty, corruption and traditional gender ideologies reproduces\ndisastrous conditions for young women and men as frequently today as when AIDS\nbroke out.\nZakia reappears everywhere I go in Tanzania twenty-five years after the Malya\nproject, from the Kagera region on Lake Victoria near the Ugandan and Rwandan\nborder, to the Mtwara region deep down by the country\u2019s south-eastern border with\nMozambique. Confirming statistical patterns, young women are regularly depicted as\nsexual objects, prostitutes, scapegoats, victims and, quite literally, femme fatales. In\nMangaka village (18 September 2003) I saw a performance about a businessman who\nseduces a secondary-school girl and convinces her tomarry him.When she gets pregnant\nhe immediately abandons her, with the outcome that she cannot go back to school or to\nher family and will have problems finding a new partner for future support. It is like a\nreincarnation of Zakia and her fate.\nIn Sululu village (11 September 2003) she staggers around drunk in a red dress on\nmarket day and hits unashamedly onmen who happen to pass by on the barabara (main\nstreet). The performance is witnessed by a couple of hundred bystanders under a mango\ntree, while elders enjoy the action on a bench.\nIn Kenyana village (19 March 2004) she is coerced into having sex with the man\nwho hired her as housemaid \u2013 and his two opium-smoking sons. At least half the village\nwatches on, in company with politicians, religious leaders and schoolchildren. The post-\nperformance discussion lasts twice as long as the theatre and ends with an agreement to\ncollect money for schoolchildren with surviving single parents.\nOn the outskirts of Masasi town (17 July 2003) a bunch of spectators linger until\ndusk to see her put up resistance by punching her husband for leaving her and the\nchildren for days on end without enough money. At a market place in Bukoba town (30\nAugust 2003), before a huge crowd of marketplace visitors, she gets deprived of all her\nproperty by her deceased husband\u2019s family and tries to hang herself. A neighbour saves\nher in the last second. A similar scenario occurs in Likokona village (19 September 2003),\nwhere she gets disinherited by her own brother, despite living in the matrilineal belt of\nsouthern Tanzania. She takes the case to court only to be double-crossed by a corrupt\njudge. The storyline is frighteningly similar to that of Zakia in 1982.\nMlama\u2019s vision of an ideological pan-African theatre informed by the cultural\nregimes of traditional societies does not promise epidemic solutions, and almost certainly\ninvolves more risk than mitigation. I will not go into detail here about the epidemic\ndeterminants of cultural practices but only point out that the precolonial order of\nkinship-regulated societies has waned almost everywhere in Africa by now and that\nthe social continuity of initiation rites involving tutoring and life skills for youth are,\nagain, often particularly detrimental to young females.48 Hence there is no given culture-\nhistorical approach to an efficient community performance against AIDS.\nRather than pursuing a historical descent, I believe that an efficient HIV-preventive\ntheatre should be sought on a more contemporaneous and horizontal level. To reiterate\n94 johansson How AIDS Changed African Community Theatre and Vice Versa\nCampbell\u2019s question, the pressing epidemic task today is to provide a broad, feasible basis\nfor action for those who are aware of HIV\/AIDS and know what to do but do not do it.\nThis complex dilemma goes beyond historical social regimes, generalized health models\nand discrete pilot projects.\nTowards a community theatre as a relational agency\nAIDS is a complex cultural syndrome that has forced community theatre to go beyond,\non the one hand, the notion of rapid conflict-solving with target groups on specific\ndevelopmental tasks and, on the other, the idea of amore basic conscientization for those\ndirectly involved with theatre. Hence AIDS challenged the culture-historical limitations\nof community theatre by urging it, according to veteran Theatre for Development\nresearcherDavidKerr, to focus on \u2018sexual issues previously thought of as taboo\u2019, \u2018attitudes\nto women and children\u2019 and \u2018issues of human rights and social exclusion\u2019.49 Reciprocally,\nonce theatre practitioners recognized and counteracted the intricate epidemic challenges,\nthey, in return, challenged the limitations of currentHIV-prevention projects by bringing\nthem out of the medical realm of white-collar instruction to the public arena of\nparticipatory practices where alternative life skills are enacted by community residents.\nI do not believe it is a coincidence that the two regions in Tanzania where significant\ndecreases in AIDS prevalence trends and HIV incidence rates have been recorded have\nhad plenty of active theatre groups involved in prevention programmes.50\nIt is possible to change an epidemic neither by discrete performances or projects\nnor with an ideological awareness per se. The epidemic challenges have brought\nabout typological as well as functional consequences for the theatre. The typological\nconsequence has to do with the historical trajectory of community theatre, from its\ndidactic foundation in colonial times to its autonomous formation in postcolonial\ntimes,51 which again needs to be re-evaluated and rewritten. Sustainable self-reliance is a\nvital condition for groups who are fighting for free speech and the liberty of association,\nbut the naive notion of artists as \u2018floating islands\u201952 can also be an isolating factor if\nthe task is about wider issues than the endurance of theatre groups. The functional\nconsequence has to do with strategic objectives other than change. With associations to\npolitical \u2018revolution\u2019 and \u2018self-determination\u2019, the practice of Theatre for Development\nhas come to define itself as an \u2018alternative practice\u2019, and \u2018the end point to this exploration\nof the alternative, and the \u201cother\u201d as an instrument of alienation and subjugation, is to\nseek a point of equilibrium or change\u2019.53\nThe course of actions as planned and implemented in theatre against AIDS should\nnot aim for change a priori, but rather function as an examination \u2013 a form of action\nresearch\u2013of the conditions for people to leadhealthy and constructive lives.54 Communal\nintervention becomes necessary in generalized epidemics (affecting 5% or more of adult\npopulations), so it is not a matter of group dynamics as in drama-in-education, drama\ntherapy or process drama.55 Theatre activities should bond and bridge social capital\nwithin andbetween groups.56 The debate about political self-determination versus donor\naffiliations is an old one for community theatre, as well as for civil society groups versus\ngovernmental influences.57 Discursive and economic self-reliance is, of course, important\nin light of colonial didacticism, academic elitism and authoritarian top-down projects,\njohansson How AIDS Changed African Community Theatre and Vice Versa 95\nbut once civil society groups working against the spread of HIV have been established\nthey need to be aligned and coordinated with other prevention programmes.\nHence the argument I want to make and urge more research around has to do\nwith a fundamental revision of the idea of an efficacious community theatre, especially\nas pertaining to the AIDS epidemic and cognate societal crises, by emphasizing its\ncrucial qualities as a relational means for change, a generic nexus in local peer-education\nprogrammes andmore comprehensive schemes in the public sector, rather than a means\nin itself, or a means for rapid change. Community theatre has all the qualifications for\nfunctioning as a \u2018best practice\u2019 in the epidemic and shouldbeused as a relational agency in\ncoordinated programmes.58 It effectively attracts the core risk groups on a voluntary basis\nin themostAIDS-affected societies in sub-SaharanAfrica; allows them to steep their pop-\nular views through ceremonial, ritual, theatrical and pedagogical modes of performance\nas well as through biographically and collectively informed community analyses; and in\nthat way meets the most urgent and taboo-laden issues head-on in performances and\npost-performance discussions where people, again and again, appeal to organizations\nand governmental authorities to consolidate actions against the depicted scenes.\nTheatre is, of course, a small device in the pandemic apparatus, a petty franchise\nin the big AIDS business, but it is the link that can join the weakest parts of the chain\nof preventive measures if aligned with other related efforts. The performances I have\nreferred to in this text have taken place in public hubs of social life, the very same places,\nin fact, where the virus spreads. A stone\u2019s throw from these performance grounds there is\nfor sure a couple of schools, three or four churches, a mosque, a hospital, miscellaneous\nworkplaces, community centres, a court building, a prison and various organizations.\nIn most places none of these institutions or organizations invite young people\u2019s theatre\ngroups.\nWhen I recently revisited the twenty theatre groups that I first met in 2003 and\n2004, it soon became clear that well-connected groups were still doing well (regardless of\nwhether theywere sponsored or not), while themore or less isolated groupswerewaning.\nThe AIDS epidemic is still as serious as it ever has been and will remain so for many\nyears. New generations need to be offered opportunities for participatory life skills and\npeer-education programmes, they need to be recruited and to recruit peers to counselling\nand testing centres and thereby get access to the newly introduced anti-retroviral drug\ntherapies, and they need to be taken seriously by politicians and other stakeholders.\nThe time for pilot projects is over and it is high time for the realization of follow-up\nprogrammes in cooperation with schools, hospitals, people living with HIV or AIDS,\nelders, non-governmental organizations, governmental offices and agencies, and so forth.\nA serious attempt is under way in Tanzania to coordinate multisectoral approaches in a\nnationwide District Response Initiative (DRI) organized by the Tanzania Commission\nfor HIV\/AIDS (TACAIDS), in which Community Mapping and Theatre against AIDS\n(COMATAA) holds a central place.59 But it is one thing to plan programmes in Dar\nes Salaam, and quite another to implement them in the communities. At a meeting\nwith TACAIDS (4 September 2006) I was told that youth are represented in district\ncommittees in line with the DRI guidelines, but that their influence had not yet been\nevaluated. Progress is constantly made on paper, but seldom in situ.\n96 johansson How AIDS Changed African Community Theatre and Vice Versa\nThe lack of progress in HIV prevention is having concrete effects on the\nperformances of theatre groups. While many groups are doing well in Kagera region,\nwhere the health-care system, youth centres and governmental agencies are working\ntogether, things are worse in Mtwara region. Some groups have simply given up; on my\nrandom revisits, villagers confirm to me that they have not taken part in theatre events\nfor a long time, which usually indicates a general absence of prevention activities. In\nthe village Lukuledi (24 August 2006) a group presented a \u2018variety show\u2019 of old-style\nstruggle songs, poetry and speeches obviously intended for visiting political delegations\nand potential donors. It is interesting to see how people, with clenched fists in the air,\ndeclare war against AIDS, but never quite make it clear who the enemy of the struggle\nis. In the village of Mikangaula (29 August 2006) a group had performed provocative\nsketches about the epidemic risks of jando and unyago (initiation rites for men and\nwomen respectively) a couple of years ago; now a remaining fraction assembled just\nto hear what the muzungu (white person) had to offer them. I had to remind them\nthat I am a researcher, not a donor. A group in Likokona, who sang a highly ironic\nshairi (poem) in 2003 about failing UNICEF promises, now (28 August 2006) put on\ninnovative performances on the local epidemic scenario with open endings for post-\nperformance discussions. They had apparently stopped waiting for money at a certain\npoint and managed to finance their own activities since then. In Mpindimbi (25 August\n2006) a youth group performed ametatheatrical piece about seminars that people attend\nbut forget about as soon as they get drunk. The thematic range of these performances\nsuggests that the community theatre in Mtwara is either vanishing or turning towards\nits own performative conditions of conducting HIV prevention.\nBy being linguistically, physically and managerially geared by the affected people\nthemselves, community theatre comes so close to the key factors of the spreadofHIV\u2013 i.e.\nthe interpersonal scenarios of power-laden regimes captivating especially young females\nin imposed sexual routines \u2013 that its implementation can be seen as an action research\nassessment of the possibilities and limitations of HIV prevention as such. Young people\nin Africa know why people knowingly engage in sexual behaviours that lead to a slow\nand painful premature death. They also knowwhy the best-intentioned attempts to stem\nthe tide of the HIV epidemic often have so little impact. Soon, if they continue to be\nignored and disrespected, the alienated youth will not tell us the truth any more but only\nmock us with a grinning death mask.\nnotes\n1 In twenty-five years AIDS is estimated to have killed about twenty-five million people and infected\nsixty-five million; thus nearly forty million are currently living with the virus. (UNAIDS\/WHO,\n\u2018Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic\u2019 (Geneva, available at http:\/\/www.unaids.org; accessed May\n2006). As Nugent points out (with reference to R. Shell, \u2018Halfway to the Holocaust: The Economic,\nDemographic, and Social Implications of the AIDS Pandemic to the year 2010 in the Southern African\nRegion\u2019, in R. Shell et al., eds., HIV\/AIDS: A Threat to the African Renaissance (Johannesburg: Konrad\nAdenauer Stiftung, 2000), p. 10), \u2018It is estimated that by 2010, AIDS will have killed more people than\nall of the previous global pandemics \u2013 including the Black Death, smallpox in the sixteenth century and\njohansson How AIDS Changed African Community Theatre and Vice Versa 97\nthe devastating 1917\/19 influenza outbreak \u2013 combined.\u2019 (P.

It is just that money and pills have for long overshadowed the\ncultural factors in the expertise of the epidemic. Anti-retroviral medicines have been distributed en\nmasse by WHO in a global scheme called \u20183 in 5\u2019 \u2013 alluding to the ambition to reach three million\npeople in five years \u2013 but they keep missing their goals even in areas for which they have secured\nfunding and medical supplies. The incidence rates simply exceed the logistical possibilities of\ndistributing medicine in many countries.\n7 C.

Nonetheless, according to statistical data, general research, my own performance\nanalyses, focus-group discussions and interviews (see below), it is undeniable that the most critical risk\nfactors and perilous experiences of the epidemic are female.\n14 T.

It is important to clarify that the links between gender trouble, sexually transmitted diseases\n(STDs) and epidemics are not African (cf. S. Arnfred, ed., Re-thinking Sexualities in Africa (Uppsala:\nAlmqvist and Wiksell, 2004)). The situation was very much the same in a country like Sweden.\nEpidemiological research about the turn of the last century shows that female employees at public\ninstitutions in Sweden had to take precautions moving about in public spheres because of the risk of\nbeing sexually abused (B.
