Finally characterisations are given of E-algebras and of Lie\nalgebras all of whose proper subalgebras are elementary.\nKeywords: Lie algebra, elementary, E-algebra, A-algebra, almost alge-\nbraic, ad-semisimple, parabolic subalgebra.\n1Supported by DGI Grant BFM2000-1049-C02-01\n1\n1 Introduction\nThis paper is a continuation of the study initiated by the authors in [10].\nThroughout L will denote a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field F .\nThe Frattini ideal of L, \u03c6(L), is the largest ideal of L contained in all\nmaximal subalgebras of L. The Lie algebra L is called \u03c6-free if \u03c6(L) = 0,\nand elementary if \u03c6(B) = 0 for every subalgebra B of L. Lie algebras all of\nwhose nilpotent subalgebras are abelian are called A-algebras; Lie algebras\nL such that \u03c6(B) \u2264 \u03c6(L) for all subalgebras B of L are called E-algebras.\nWe are seeking to determine properties of, and inter-relationships between,\nthese three classes of algebras. A linear Lie algebra L \u2264 gl(V ) is almost\nalgebraic if L contains the nilpotent and semisimple Jordan components of\nits elements; an abstract Lie algebra L is then called almost algebraic if\nadL \u2264 gl(L) is almost algebraic.\nThroughout sections two and three F is assumed to have characteristic\nzero. In section 2 we show first that L is \u03c6-free if and only if it is almost\nalgebraic and its nilradical is abelian. It follows from this that if L is almost\nalgebraic then \u03c6(L) = N2, where N is the nilradical of L. Zhao and Lu\nproved in [13] that every almost-algebraic A-algebra is elementary, whenever\nthe ground field is algebraically closed of characteristic zero. We generalise\nthis by showing that L is an almost-algebraic A-algebra if and only if it is\nelementary (and without the assumption of an algebraically closed field).\nFrom this we deduce that if L is a Lie A-algebra with a \u03c6-free solvable\nradical, then L is elementary. The final result in this section is that if L is\na Lie A-algebra then it is an E-algebra.\nA subalgebra P of L is called parabolic if P \u2297F F contains a Borel sub-\nalgebra (that is, a maximal solvable subalgebra) of L\u2297F F , where F is the\nalgebraic closure of F . The main purpose of section 3 is to prove two re-\nsults. The first is that if P is a minimal parabolic subalgebra of L then\nthe following are equivalent: P is \u03c6-free; the nilradical of P is abelian; and\nP is elementary. The second is that if L is a semisimple Lie algebra all\nof whose minimal parabolic subalgebras are \u03c6-free then L is an A-algebra,\nand hence elementary. In order to establish these results we need a number\nof properties of parabolic subalgebras. Some of these may be known, but\nwe know of no references to them other than that Vo\u00a8lklein in [12] shows\nthat if L is semisimple then the minimal parabolic subalgebras of L are\nthe idealisers of the maximal nil subalgebras of L. He uses, however, the\ncanonical correspondence between the connected subgroups of the identity\ncomponent of the automorphism group of L and the algebraic subalgebras\nof L. Our proofs are based entirely on internal properties of L itself and so,\n2\nwe believe, are of interest in themselves. We also include these proofs for\nthe convenience of the reader.\nIn the final section we look more closely at Lie E-algebras. In particular\nwe give a characterisation of them over a field of characteristic zero. We also\ncharacterise Lie algebras all of whose proper subalgebras are elementary.\nThese generalise Theorems 4.3 and 4.7 and Corollaries 4.4 and 4.5 of [9] by\nremoving the requirement that the underlying field be algebraically closed.\nWe will denote vector space direct sums by \u2295 and semidirect products\nby o. If A is a subalgebra of B we will write A \u2264 B, whereas A < B\nwill mean that A is a proper subalgebra of B. The (solvable) radical (resp.\nnilradical) of L will be denoted by R(L) (resp. N(L)), whilst Asoc(L) will\ndenote the sum (necessarily direct) of the minimal abelian ideals of L.\n2 Preliminary results\nFirst we reveal the relationship between almost-algebraic and \u03c6-free Lie\nalgebras.\nProposition 2.1 Let L be a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero.\n(i) If L is \u03c6-free, then L is almost algebraic.\n(ii) Let L be almost algebraic. Then L is \u03c6-free if and only if its nilradical\nis abelian.\nProof. (i) Let L be \u03c6-free. By [8] we have that L = N(L) + S where S\nis a subalgebra of L such that adLS is completely reducible and N(L) =\nAsoc(L). From [1, Theorem 2.2] it follows that L is almost algebraic.\n(ii) By [1, Theorem 2.2] we have that L = N(L) + S where S is a\nsubalgebra of L such that adLS is completely reducible. Now, assume that\nN(L) is abelian. Then we have that N(L) = Asoc L. So L is \u03c6-free by [8].\nThe converse follows from [8].\nCorollary 2.2 Let L be an almost-algebraic Lie algebra over a field of char-\nacteristic zero. Then \u03c6(L) = N2, where N is the nilradical of L.\n3\nProof. Clearly N2 is almost algebraic and so L\/N2 is almost algebraic, by [1,\nLemma 4.1]. Moreover, N(L\/N2) is abelian and hence \u03c6-free by Proposition\n2.1. It follows that \u03c6(L) \u2286 N2. The reverse inclusion is given by [8, Theorem\n6.5].\nIf B is a subalgebra of L we define the idealiser of B in L to be IL(B) =\n{x \u2208 L : [x,B] \u2264 B}. Next we show that a Lie algebra is an almost-algebraic\nA-algebra if and only if it is elementary, thereby generalising the result of\nZhao and Lu proved in [13]. First we need the following result.\nProposition 2.3 Let L be an almost-algebraic Lie algebra over a field of\ncharacteristic zero. If every almost-algebraic subalgebra of L is \u03c6-free, then\nL is elementary.\nProof. Let B be a subalgebra of L. Then the idealiser of B in L, IL(B),\nis almost algebraic, by [1, Theorem 2.3]. By our hypothesis, we have\n\u03c6(IL(B)) = 0. But now B is an ideal of IL(B), so \u03c6(B) \u2264 \u03c6(IL(B)),\nby [8, Corollary 4.2]. Hence L is elementary.\nTheorem 2.4 Let L be a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero.\nThen L is an almost-algebraic A-algebra if and only if it is elementary.\nProof. (\u21d2) Let L be an almost-algebraic A-algebra and let B be an almost-\nalgebraic subalgebra of L. Then by Corollary 2.2 it follows that \u03c6(B) = N2,\nwhere N is the nilradical of B. Therefore, \u03c6(B) = 0 since N is abelian.\nHence L is elementary by Proposition 2.3.\n(\u21d0) This follows from [10, Corollary 4.7].\nCorollary 2.5 Let L be a Lie A-algebra over a field of characteristic zero.\nIf R(L) is \u03c6-free, then L is elementary.\nProof. Assume that R(L) is \u03c6-free. By Proposition 2.1 we have that R(L)\nis almost algebraic. Then, from [1, Corollary 3.1] it follows that L is also\nalmost algebraic. So, L is elementary by Theorem 2.4.\nCorollary 2.6 Let L be an almost-algebraic Lie A-algebra over a field of\ncharacteristic zero. Then L splits over each of its ideals.\n4\nProof. This follows from Theorem 2.4 and [9, Lemma 2.3].\nFinally we have that Lie A-algebras are necessarily E-algebras.\nProposition 2.7 Let L be a Lie A-algebra over a field of characteristic\nzero. Then L is an E-algebra.\nProof. We have that L\/\u03c6(L) is an A-algebra, by [6, Lemma 1]. On the other\nhand, we have that L\/\u03c6(L) is \u03c6-free and so almost algebraic by Proposition\n2.1. Then L\/\u03c6(L) is elementary, by Theorem 2.4. So, L is an E-algebra, by\n[11, Proposition 2].\nDenote by A, G, E , L, \u03a6 the classes of A-algebras, almost algebraic\nalgebras, E-algebras, elementary algebras and \u03c6-free algebras respectively.\nThen, to summarise, what we have shown is the following:\nL \u2282 \u03a6 \u2282 G, L \u2282 A \u2282 E and G \u2229 A = L.\n3 Parabolic subalgebras\nThroughout this section L denotes a (non-zero) semisimple Lie algebra over\na field F of characteristic zero. We denote by F the algebraic closure of F ,\nand write S = S \u2297F F for each subspace S of L. For each subalgebra S of\nL, let U(S) denote the set of ad-nilpotent elements in the solvable radical,\nR(S), of S. Our main objective in this section is to show that in order to\ncheck whether a Lie algebra is elementary it suffices to look at its minimal\nparabolic subalgebras. First we have some properties of the nilradical of a\nparabolic subalgebra.\nProposition 3.1 Let P be a parabolic subalgebra of L. Then\n(i) N(P ) is nil in L;\n(ii) if P < Q < L, then N(Q) < N(P ); and\n(iii) P = IL(N(P )).\n5\nProof. Since N(P ) is the nilradical of P and IL(N(P )) = IL(N(P )) (see\n[2, pages 42 and 36]) we may assume that F is algebraically closed. Now P\nis conjugate to a standard parabolic subalgebra and so we can assume it is\nof the following form. Let H be a Cartan subalgebra of L and let \u2206 be the\nset of roots corresponding to H. Then\nP = H \u2295 \u03a3\u03b1\u2208\u2206+L\u03b1 \u2295 \u03a3\u03b1\u2208\u21261L\u03b1,\nwhere \u21261 \u2286 \u2206\u2212. Let \u2126\u20321 = {\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206+ | \u2212\u03b1 6\u2208 \u21261}. Then we have that\nN(P ) = \u03a3\u03b1\u2208\u2126\u20321L\u03b1\nIt follows that N(P ) is nil in L and (i) is proved.\nTo prove (ii), suppose that P < Q < L. Then Q is also parabolic and\nso has the same form as P but with \u21261 replaced by \u21262 where \u21261 \u2282 \u21262. We\nhave that \u2126\u20322 \u2282 \u2126\u20321 and hence N(Q) < N(P ).\nTo prove (iii), put Q = IL(N(P )) and suppose that P < Q. By (ii) we\nhave N(Q) < N(P ). On the other hand, as N(P ) is a nilpotent ideal of Q\nwe have N(P ) \u2264 N(Q), which is a contradiction. Now the proof is complete.\nThe centre of L is the set Z(L) = {x \u2208 L : [x, L] = 0}. A subalgebra T of\nL is said to be a toral subalgebra of L if T is abelian and adLt is semisimple\nfor every t \u2208 T . Next we need that if P is an algebraic subalgebra of L then\nU(P ) behaves well under field extension.\nLemma 3.2 Let U be a nil subalgebra of L. Then U is also a nil subalgebra\nof L\nProof. We have that U is a nilpotent algebraic subalgebra of L, since\nthese properties are inherited from U (see [4, p.181]). So, U = U(U) \u2295 T ,\nwhere T is a toral subalgebra of L and [T,U(U)] = 0, by [3, Theorem 4]. We\nhave T \u2264 Z(U) = Z(U) (see [2, page 36]). As Z(U) consists of commuting\nad-nilpotent elements, we have that Z(U) is a nil subalgebra of L. This\nyields that T is both nil and toral in L and so T \u2264 Z(L) = 0. This yields\nthat U = U(U) and so U is nil in L.\nProposition 3.3 Let P be an algebraic subalgebra of L. Then U(P ) =\nU(P )\n6\nProof. Since P is algebraic, we have that P = U(P ) \u2295M , where M =\nS \u2295 Z(M) and S is semisimple (M is a Levi factor of P ), by [3, Theorem\n4]. It follows that P = U(P )\u2295M and M = S \u2295Z(M). On the other hand,\nfrom Lemma 3.2, it follows that U(P ) is a nil ideal of L. So, U(P ) \u2264 U(P ).\nThis yields that U(P ) = U(P ).\nThe following results are concerned with relationships between parabolic\nsubalgebras and certain nil subalgebras.\nLemma 3.4 Let U be a nil subalgebra of L and put P = IL(U). If U =\nU(P ), then P is parabolic.\nProof. This follows from Proposition 3.3 and [7, Theorem 29.8.1]\nProposition 3.5 Let U be a nil subalgebra of L and put P = IL(U). Then\nthere is a parabolic subalgebra Q of L satisfying:\n(i) U \u2264 U(Q);\n(ii) P \u2264 Q; and\n(iii) U(P ) \u2264 U(Q).\nProof. Put U0 = U and Q1 = IL(U0). Define inductively the two sequences\n{Ui}i\u22650, {Qi}i\u22651 by Qi = IL(Ui\u22121) Ui = U(Qi). Then Qi = IL(Ui\u22121) =\nIL(U(Qi\u22121)) \u2265 Qi\u22121, so these sequences are increasing. This yields that\nthere is an integer j such that Qj = Qj+1; that is Qj = IL(Uj). It follows\nfrom Lemma 3.4 that Q = Qj is a parabolic subalgebra of L. We have that\nU \u2264 Uj = U(Q), giving (i), and P = IL(U) = Q1 \u2264 Q, giving (ii).\nFinally, Qi = IL(Ui\u22121) so Ui\u22121 is a nil ideal of Qi and Ui\u22121 \u2264 U(Qi),\nwhence U1 = U(P ) \u2264 U(Q), giving (iii).\nProposition 3.6 (i) If U is a maximal nil subalgebra of L, then IL(U)\nis a minimal parabolic subalgebra of L.\n(ii) If P is a minimal parabolic subalgebra of L, then U(P ) is a maximal\nnil subalgebra of L\n7\nProof. (i): Let U be a maximal nil subalgebra of L. We have that U is a nil\nideal of IL(U) and so U \u2264 U(IL(U). By the maximality of U , we must have\nthat U = U(IL(U)). From Lemma 3.4 it follows that IL(U) is parabolic.\nNow let Q be a parabolic subalgebra with Q \u2264 IL(U). By Proposition 3.1\nwe have that U = N(IL(U)) \u2264 N(Q) = U(Q). By the maximality of U\nit follows that U = N(Q). This yields that IL(U) = Q by Proposition 3.1\nagain, and so IL(U) is a minimal parabolic subalgebra of L.\n(ii): Let P be a minimal parabolic subalgebra of L. Suppose that there\nis a nil subalgebra V of L such that U(P ) < V . By Engel\u2019s Theorem we\nhave that U(P ) < V \u2229 IL(U(P )). As P is parabolic, IL(U(P )) = P . Put\nW = V \u2229 P . Let M be a Levi factor of P ; so that P = U(P ) \u2295 M ,\nM = Z(M)\u2295S where Z(M) is toral in L and S is a semisimple subalgebra\nof L.\nWe see that W = U(P )\u2295 (M \u2229 V ). Since Z(M) is toral it follows that\nM \u2229 V = S \u2229 V . So, S \u2229 V is a non-trivial nil subalgebra of the semisimple\nLie algebra S. From Proposition 3.5 there is a parabolic subalgebra Q of\nS, Q 6= S, containing S \u2229 V . Let B a Borel subalgebra of S contained in\nQ. Then, we have that R(P ) + B is a maximal solvable subalgebra of P .\nSince P is parabolic in L, it follows that R(P ) +B is a Borel subalgebra of\nL. We have R(P ) +Q = R(P ) +Q \u2265 R(P ) +B. Therefore, R(P ) +Q is a\nparabolic subalgebra of L contained in P , which contradicts the minimality\nof P . Hence U(P ) is a maximal nil subalgebra of L.\nA Lie algebra L is said to be ad-semisimple if adx is semisimple for every\nx \u2208 L. Then we have the following criterion for a parabolic subalgebra to\nbe minimal.\nCorollary 3.7 A parabolic subalgebra P of L is minimal if and only if\nP\/U(P ) is ad-semisimple.\nProof. Let M be a Levi factor of P . Let us first suppose that P is minimal.\nThen, by Proposition 3.6 it follows that U(P ) is a maximal nil subalgebra of\nL and so M is ad-semisimple. Now assume that P\/U(P ) is ad-semisimple,\nso that M is ad-semisimple. As Z(L) = 0, we see that U(P ) is a maximal\nnil subalgebra of P . Since P = IL(P ), it follows from Engel\u2019s Theorem that\nU(P ) is maximal nil subalgebra of L.\nWe now have the results that we need to show the role played by the min-\nimal parabolic subalgebras in determining whether or not L is elementary.\n8\nLemma 3.8 Let P be a minimal parabolic subalgebra of L. Then the fol-\nlowing are equivalent\n(i) P is \u03c6-free;\n(ii) N(P ) is abelian; and\n(iii) P is elementary.\nProof. (i)\u21d2(ii): Since P is algebraic, it follows from Corollary 2.2 that\nN(P )2 = \u03c6(P ) = 0.\n(ii)\u21d2(iii): Since N(R(P )) = N(P ) and R(P ) is algebraic, it follows\nfrom Proposition 2.1 that R(P ) is \u03c6-free. By [10, Theorem 2.5] we have\nthat R(P ) is elementary. On the other hand, since U(P ) \u2264 R(P ), it follows\nfrom Corollary 3.7 that P\/R(P ) is ad-semisimple. But [10, Proposition 4.4]\nnow implies that P is elementary.\n(iii)\u21d2(i): This is trivial.\nTheorem 3.9 Let L be a semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteris-\ntic zero, and suppose that all minimal parabolic subalgebras of L are \u03c6-free.\nThen L is an A-algebra, and hence elementary.\nProof. First we show that L is an A-algebra. Let U be a nilpotent subalgebra\nof L. Then U is contained in a maximal solvable subalgebra \u0393 of L. As \u0393 is\nalgebraic we can write \u0393 = U(\u0393)+\u02d9T where T is a toral subalgebra. Let N\nbe a maximal nil subalgebra of L containing U(\u0393), and let P be the idealiser\nin L of N . By Proposition 3.6, P is minimal parabolic and hence \u03c6-free. It\nfollows from Lemma 3.8 that P is elementary, and hence an A-algebra by\nProposition 2.4. This yields that U(\u0393) is abelian. But then \u0393 is \u03c6-free and\nhence elementary, by [10, Theorem 2.5]. It follows that U is abelian and\nthat L is an A-algebra.\nBy 2.4 it follows that L is elementary.\n4 E-algebras\nFirst we have an easy strengthening of Corollary 2.2 of [10].\n9\nProposition 4.1 Let L be a solvable Lie algebra over a perfect field. Then\nL is an E-algebra if and only if L is strongly solvable.\nProof. This follows from [10, Corollary 2.2] and [11].\nNext we have the following versions of Theorem 4.3 and Corollaries 4.4\nand 4.5 of [9] with the assumption that the underlying field be algebraically\nclosed removed.\nTheorem 4.2 Let L be a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero.\nThen L is an E-algebra if and only if one of the following holds:\n(i) L is solvable;\n(ii) L is elementary and semisimple; or\n(iii) L = R\u2295S, where R = R(L) is the radical of L, S = S1\u2295S2, S1 is an\nad-semisimple ideal of S, S2 is an elementary and semisimple ideal of\nS, and S2R \u2264 \u03c6(L).\nProof. (\u21d2): Let L be an E-algebra and suppose that L is not solvable\nor semisimple. By Levi\u2019s Theorem we can write L = R \u2295 S where S is a\nsemisimple subalgebra of L. If U is a subalgebra of L then write U for its\nimage in L\/\u03c6(L) under the natural homomorphism. We have L = R \u2295 S\nand S \u223c= S is elementary and semisimple. Put S = S1 \u2295 S2 where S2 is the\nlargest semisimple ideal of L. If S1 6= 0, then S1 \u223c= S1 is ad-semisimple, as\nin [10, Theorem 4.6]. Clearly S2R \u2264 \u03c6(L), so (iii) holds.\n(\u21d0): If (i) holds then L is strongly solvable (since the ground field has\ncharacteristic 0) and the result follows from Proposition 4.1 above. If (ii)\nholds the result is clear. So suppose that (iii) holds. Then L = L1\u2295S2 where\nL1 = R \u2295 S1. Now L1\/R \u223c= S1 \u223c= S1 is ad-semisimple and R is elementary,\nso L1 is elementary, by [10, Proposition 4.4]. It follows that L is elementary,\nand hence that L is an E-algebra.\nCorollary 4.3 Let L be a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero,\nand suppose that the radical of L is nilpotent. Then Lis an E-algebra if and\nonly if one of the following holds:\n(i) L is nilpotent;\n10\n(ii) L is elementary and semisimple; or\n(iii) L = (R \u2295 S1)\u2295 S2, where R = R(L) is the radical of L, S1 is an ad-\nsemisimple subalgebra of L, and S2 is an elementary and semisimple\nideal of L.\nProof. This follows as in [9, Corollary 4.4].\nCorollary 4.4 Let L be a perfect Lie algebra (i.e., L = L2) over a field of\ncharacteristic zero. Then L is an E-algebra if and only if L is elementary\nand semisimple.\nFinally we consider non-elementary Lie algebras all of whose proper sub-\nalgebras are elementary. We call such algebras minimal non-elementary Lie\nalgebras. The following extends Theorem 4.7 of [9].\nTheorem 4.5 Let L be a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero.\nThen L is a minimal non-elementary Lie algebra if and only if\n(i) L = L2oFx, where L2 is abelian and 0 6= \u03c6(L) = AsocL is the biggest\nideal of L properly contained in L2, or\n(ii) L is the three-dimensional Heisenberg algebra.\nProof. (\u21d2) First note that L must be an E-algebra. Suppose that L is\nnot solvable. Then R = R(L) is elementary and so almost algebraic by\n[10, Proposition 4.1]. Hence L is almost algebraic, by [1, Corollary 3.1].\nMoreover, the nilradical is elementary and so abelian. It follows that L is\n\u03c6-free, by Proposition 2.1, and so elementary - a contradiction. This yields\nthat L is solvable.\nSuppose that L is not nilpotent. Then \u03c6(L) 6= L2 (see, for example, [8,\nsection 5]), so there is a maximal subalgebra M of L such that L = L2+M .\nChoosing B to be a subalgebra minimal with respect to the property that\nL = L2+B we have L2\u2229B \u2264 \u03c6(B) = 0 (see [8, Lemma 7.1]), so L = L2\u2295B\nand B is abelian. Moreover, L2 is nilpotent and elementary, and so abelian.\nSuppose that dimB > 1. Let K be a maximal subalgebra of B. Then\nM = L2 +K is a maximal subalgebra of L, so M is elementary and hence\n\u03c6-free. It follows from [8, Theorem 7.4] that L2 is completely reducible as\n11\na K- module, and hence that each element of K acts semisimply on L2 ([5,\nTheorem 10, page 81]). But every element of B is contained in a maximal\nsubalgebra of B and so acts semisimply on L2. This yields that L2 is a\ncompletely reducible B-module, whence L2 \u2264 Asoc L and L splits over\nAsoc L. But then \u03c6(L) = 0, by [8, Theorem 7.3], and L is elementary, a\ncontradiction. Thus dimB = 1, so put B = Fx.\nSo we now have L = L2 o Fx where L2 is abelian. Let C be an ideal of\nL with Asoc L < C < L2 and put D = C + Fx. Then D 6= L so \u03c6(D) = 0,\ngiving Asoc D = N(D) \u2265 C. But every minimal ideal of D is inside L2 and\ninvariant under adx and so is an ideal of L. It follows that C = Asoc D \u2264\nAsoc L, a contradiction. Hence Asoc L is the biggest ideal of L properly\ncontained in L2. We must have Asoc L \u2264 \u03c6(L), since otherwise L splits over\nAsoc L, as in paragraph two above. As \u03c6(L) 6= L2 this means that \u03c6(L) =\nAsoc L and we have case (i).\nSuppose now that L is nilpotent. Then L is not abelian, so dim L \u2265 3\nand L has a chain of ideals\n0 = L0 < L1 < ... < Ln = L,\nwhere dim Li = i and LLi \u2264 Li\u22121 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Let L1 = Fz, L2 = Fy+Fz,\nand let x be any element of L. If Fx+ Fy + Fz is abelian for every x \u2208 L\nthen L is abelian, a contradiction. Hence L has a subalgebra isomorphic\nto the three-dimensional Heisenberg algebra. Such a subalgebra cannot be\nproper as it is not elementary.\n(\u21d0) It is clear that the three-dimensional Heisenberg algebra is minimal\nnon-elementary, so assume that L is as described in (i). It suffices to show\nthat the maximal subalgebras of L are elementary. Let M be a maximal\nsubalgebra of L. Since Asoc L \u2264 M either M = L2 or M = Asoc L + Fx\nfor some x \u2208 L \\ L2. In the former case M is abelian and so elementary.\nSo assume that M = Asoc L+ Fx and L = L2 + Fx. Let A be a minimal\nideal of M . Then A \u2264 Asoc L and [A,L] \u2264 [A, x] \u2264 A so A is an ideal of L.\nIt follows that Asoc M = Asoc L and M splits over Asoc M . Hence M is\n\u03c6-free. Since M is clearly an E-algebra, it is elementary.\nNote: The algebras L described in Theorem 4.5 (i) are A-algebras (as\nevery nilpotent subalgebra of L is inside L2) that are not elementary. They\nare therefore not almost algebraic.\n12\nReferences\n[1] L. Auslander and J. Brezin, \u2018Almost Algebraic Lie Algebras\u2019, J.\nAlgebra 8 (1968), 295\u2013313.\n[2] N.
