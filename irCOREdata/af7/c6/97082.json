This dynamic style was more com-\nplex in the case of van Gogh paintings of the last period:\nturbulence is the main adjective used to describe these paint-\nings. It has been specifically mentioned, for instance, that\nthe famous painting Starry Night, vividly transmits the sense\nof turbulence and was compared with a picture of a dis-\ntant star from the NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope,\nwhere eddies probably caused by dust and gas turbulence\nare clearly seen [2]. It is the purpose of this paper to show\nthat the probability distribution function (PDF) of luminance\nfluctuations in some impassioned van Gogh paintings com-\npare notably well with the PDF of the velocity differences\nin a turbulent flow as predicted by the statistical theory of\nA.N. Kolmogorov [3\u20135]. This is not the first time that this\nanalogy with hydrodynamic turbulence is reported in a field\nfar from fluid mechanics; it has been also observed in fluc-\ntuations of the foreign exchange markets time series [6].\nThe science behind the arts has been the source of in-\nspiration and intense discussions for many people during\nthe centuries [7]. Furthermore, many art critics have bor-\nrowed terms that evoke concepts that arise in scientific dis-\nciplines. Such use is free, without a precise meaning. Thus,\nit is valid to ask how precise are the adjectives used by crit-\nics in the description of art. In this article we try to answer\nthis question by looking into the particular case of some van\nGogh paintings since the adjectives that most of the crit-\nics use to describe his work are \u201cturbulent\u201d and \u201cchaotic\u201d.\nFor that goal, we mainly study van Gogh\u2019s Starry Night\n(June 1889), which more vividly transmits the feeling of tur-\nbulence. Also, as a sample of other turbulent pictures, we\nanalyze Two Peasant Women Digging in Field with Snow\n276 J Math Imaging Vis (2008) 30: 275\u2013283\n(March-April, 1890), Road with Cypress and Star (May,\n1890) and Wheat Field with Crows (July, 1890). By con-\nsidering the analogy with the Kolmogorov turbulence the-\nory, from our results we conclude that the turbulence of the\nluminance of the studied van Gogh paintings shows simi-\nlar characteristic to real turbulence. Our results reinforce the\nidea that scientific objectivity may help to determine the fun-\ndamental content of artistic paintings, as was already done\nwith Jackson Pollock\u2019s fractal paintings [8, 9].\n2 Luminance\nLuminance is a measure of the luminous intensity per unit\narea. It describes the amount of light that passes through or\nis emitted from a particular area, and falls within a given\nsolid angle [10]. Its psychological effect is bright and thus\nluminance is an indicator of how bright a surface will appear.\nIn a digital image, the luminance of a given pixel is obtained\nfrom its RBG (red, green and blue) components as [11]\n0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B. (1)\nThis formula takes into account the fact that the human\neye is more sensitive to green, then red and lastly blue.\nThe luminance value of different colors is easily obtained\nwith this formula; we quickly infer that the color with more\ngreen is brighter to the eye than the color with more blue,\nand some examples are as follows. Using RGB values in\n24 bits per pixel (8 bits per color), black color (0,0,0)\nhas the lowest luminace (0) and white (255,255,255) the\nhigher one (255). Intermediate values corresponds, for in-\nstance, to blue (0,0,255) \u2192 29, red (255,0,0) \u2192 76,\ngreen (0,255,0) \u2192 150, cyan (0,255,255) \u2192 179, yellow\n(255,255,0) \u2192 226, etc. Interestingly, gray colors have the\nsame RBG values, so (10,10,10) is a dark gray with lu-\nminance 10 and (200,200,200) is a light gray with lumi-\nnance 200.\nLuminance contains the most important piece of informa-\ntion in a visual context and has been used by artists to pro-\nduce certain effects. For instance, the technique of equilu-\nminance has been used since the first impressionist painters\nto transmit the sensation of motion in a painting. Notably\nClaude Monet in his famous painting Impression, Sunrise\n(1872), used regions with the same luminance, but contrast-\ning colours, to make his sunset twinkle. The biological basis\nbehind this effect is that colour and luminance are analyzed\nby different parts of the visual system; shape is registered by\nthe region that processes colour information (ventral path-\nway) but motion is registered by the colour-blind part (dor-\nsal pathway) [1]. Thus equiluminant regions can be differ-\nentiated by colour contrast, but they have poorly defined\npositions and may seem to vibrate [1]. It seems likely that\nvan Gogh dominated this technique but some of the paint-\nings of his last period produce a more disturbing feeling:\nthey transmit the sense of turbulence. By assuming that lu-\nminance is the property that van Gogh used to transmit this\nfeeling (without being aware of it), we will quantify the tur-\nbulence of some impassioned paintings by means of a statis-\ntical analysis of luminance, similar to the statistical analysis\nof velocities that Andrei Kolmogorov used to study fluid tur-\nbulence.\n3 A Brief Account of the Statistical Theory of\nA.N. Kolmogorov\nThe statistical model of Kolmogorov [3, 4] is a founda-\ntion for modern turbulence theory. The main idea is that at\nvery large Reynolds numbers, between the large scale of en-\nergy input (L) and the dissipation scale (\u03b7), at which vis-\ncous frictions become dominant, there is a myriad of small\nscales where turbulence displays universal properties inde-\npendent of the initial and boundary conditions. In particular,\nin the inertial range, Kolmogorov predicts a famous scal-\ning property of the second order structure function, S2(R) =\n\u3008(\u03b4vR)2\u3009, where \u03b4vR = v(r + R) \u2212 v(r) is the velocity in-\ncrement between two points separated by a distance R and\nv is the component of the velocity in the direction of R.\nIn his first 1941 paper [3], Kolmogorov postulates two hy-\npotheses of similarity that led to the prediction that S2(R)\nscales as (\u03b5R)2\/3, where R = \u2016R\u2016 and \u03b5 is the mean energy\ndissipation rate per unit mass. Under the same assumptions,\nin his second 1941 turbulence paper [4] Kolmogorov found\nan exact expression for the third moment, \u3008(\u03b4vR)3\u3009, which is\ngiven by S3(R) = \u2212 45\u03b5R. Furthermore, he hypothesized that\nthis scaling result generalizes to structure functions of any\norder, i.e. Sn(R) = \u3008(\u03b4vR)n\u3009 \u221d R\u03ben , where \u03ben = n\/3. Exper-\nimental measurements show that Kolmogorov was remark-\nably close to the truth in the sense that statistical quantities\ndepend on the length scale R as a power law. However, the\nintermittent nature of turbulence (alternation in time of tur-\nbulent and non-turbulent motion of the fluid) causes that the\nnumerical values of \u03ben to deviate progressively from n\/3\nwhen n increases, following a concave curve below the n\/3\nline [5]. In 1962, Kolmogorov [5] and Obukhov [12] recog-\nnized that turbulence is too intermittent to be described by\nsimple power laws and proposed a refinement with a log-\nnormal form of the probability density of \u03b5R , the energy\ndissipation rate per unit mass averaged at scale R.\nAn important function to characterize turbulence is the\nPDF of velocity differences \u03b4vR , denoted by P(\u03b4vR). Dif-\nferent models have been proposed to describe the shape of\nthis function at different scales R and we adopt here the ap-\nproach by Castaign et al. [13] that, supported by experimen-\ntal results, follows the idea of the log-normal form of \u03b5R . By\nJ Math Imaging Vis (2008) 30: 275\u2013283 277\nFig. 1 Semi-log plot of (2) for \u03bb = 0.6,0.3,0.2,0.11,0.009 (from bot-\ntom to top). The most probable variance \u03c30 was set to 1.0 and curves\nhave been vertically shifted for better visibility\nsuperimposing several Gaussians at different scales, it is in-\nferred that the shape of the PDF goes from nearly Gaussian\nat large scales R to nearly exponential at small scales. The\nnumber of superimposed Gaussians is controlled by a para-\nmeter, \u03bb, which is the only parameter that must be fitted to\nthe data. A large value of \u03bb means that many scales con-\ntribute to the results, and thus the PDF develops tails that\ndecays much slower than a pure Gaussian correlation [13].\nSpecifically, Castaign et al. proposed the following symmet-\nric distribution with variance \u03c3 :\nP\u03bb(\u03b4vR) = 12\u03c0\u03bb\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nexp\n(\n\u2212 (\u03b4vR)\n2\n2\u03c3 2\n)\n\u00d7 exp\n(\n\u2212 ln\n2(\u03c3\/\u03c30)\n2\u03bb2\n)\nd\u03c3\n\u03c3 2\n, (2)\nwhere \u03c30 is the most probable variance of \u03b4vR . From the\nlog-normal hypothesis it is inferred [13] that \u03bb2, which mea-\nsures the variance of the log-normal distribution, decreases\nlinearly with ln(R).\nTo summarize the previous discussion, sample PDF plots\nof turbulent flows, according to this model, are presented in\nFig. 1 for several values of \u03bb and \u03c30 = 1. Notice that curves\nhave been vertically shifted for better visibility. It is worth-\nwhile remarking that P\u03bb(\u03b4vR) is a probability distribution\nand thus, for comparison purposes between different sys-\ntems, usually \u03b4vR is rescaled [13] in such a way that a new\nvariable \u03b4\u2032vR is defined as \u03b4\u2032vR = (\u03b4vR \u2212 \u3008\u03b4vR\u3009)\/\u03c3 . Us-\ning such rescaling, \u03b4\u2032vR has zero mean and the second mo-\nment of P\u03bb(\u03b4\u2032vR) is one. Thus, one can measure how much\nP\u03bb(\u03b4\n\u2032vR) deviates from a Gaussian with zero mean and stan-\ndard deviation one, since for example all Gaussians collapse\nin the same curve. As we will explain later, in our analysis\nof the paintings the same normalization was used. As a re-\nsult, a quantitative and qualitative comparison can be made\nbetween the curves obtained from (2) and the paintings.\n4 Methods\nOur goal is to perform a statistical analysis of he differences\nof luminance of pixels separated by a distance R in a dig-\nital image, in order to compare with Kolgomorov\u2019s theory\npredictions. In this Section, we provide the details of the\nprocedure, which can be summarized into three steps:\n1. The luminance of each pixel is obtained from the digital\nimage by using the formula (1).\n2. The PDF of pixel luminance fluctuations is calculated by\nbuilding up a matrix L whose rows contain the differ-\nences in luminance \u03b4uR and columns contain separation\nbetween pixels R (see the example below).\n3. From the above matrix, we determine the normalized\nPDF of the luminance differences:\nP(\u03b4uR) = (\u03b4uR \u2212 \u3008\u03b4uR\u3009)\/(\u3008(\u03b4uR)2\u3009)1\/2. (3)\nTo go into the details of the last two steps, consider the\nhighly simplified example shown in Fig. 2a consisting of a\n5 \u00d7 5 pixel gray scale image stored using 3 bits per pixel,\nwhich allows 8 shades of gray 0,1, . . .7, where 0 corre-\nsponds to black and 7 to white. From the values shown in\nthis figure, we obtain the matrix L shown in Fig. 3, where\ndiagonal distances were approximated by the nearest integer\nfunction (round). An histogram of the differences in lumi-\nnance for pixels separated by a distance R = 3 is directly\nobtained from the third column of the matrix L and shown\nin Fig. 2b. From this graphic, the PDF is obtained as fol-\nlows. (a) The heights hi , i = 1,2, . . . ,15 of the histogram\nare normalized to the area A under its own curve, i.e., hi\/A,\ni = 1,2, . . . ,15 and the curve is displaced to get zero mean\n(measured mean is 0.0671); (b) According (3), the curve is\nnow normalized to the standard deviation \u03c3 which is calcu-\nlated as a expectation value (since the normalized histogram\nobtained in the previous step is itself a probability distrib-\nution), in this example we get \u03c3 = 2.9235 thus ordinates\nare scaled by \u03c3 and abscissas by 1\/\u03c3 . The semilog plot of\nP(\u03b4u3) for this example is shown in Fig. 3c.\nIn the analysis of the digital images of van Gogh paint-\nings, comparisons with the theoretically predicted PDF\ncurve (2) were carried out by finding, by a trial and error\nmethod the value of \u03bb that yields the best fit to the measured\nPDF. In all the cases studied here, we consider \u03c30 = 1.0.\n278 J Math Imaging Vis (2008) 30: 275\u2013283\nFig. 2 Simplified example to illustrate the procedure for obtaining the\nPDF of the luminance differences of a gray scale image.

Diagonal distances were approximated by the nearest\ninteger function\n5 Results\nStarry Night (June, 1889), painted during his one year pe-\nriod in the Saint Paul de Mausole Asylum at Saint-R\u00e9my-\nde-Provence, is undoubtedly one of the best known and most\nreproduced paintings by van Gogh (Fig. 4). The composition\ndescribes an imaginary sky in a twilight state, transfigured\nby a vigorous circular brushwork. To perform the luminance\nstatistics of Starry Night, we start from a digitized, 300 dpi,\n2750 \u00d7 3542 image obtained from The Museum of Modern\nArt in New York (where the original painting lies), provided\nby Art Resource, Inc. The PDF of pixel luminance fluctu-\nations of the overall image was calculated as described in\nSect. 4 and in Fig. 5 we show this function for six pixel sep-\narations, R = 60, 240, 400, 600, 800, 1200. In order to rule\nout scaling artifacts, we have systematically recalculated the\nFig. 4 Vincent van Gogh\u2019s Starry Night (taken from the WebMu-\nseum-Paris webpage: www.ibiblio.org\/wm\/)\nFig. 5 Semi-log plot of the probability density P (\u03b4u) of luminance\nchanges \u03b4u for pixel separations R = 60, 240, 400, 600, 800, 1200\n(from bottom to top). Curves have been vertically shifted for better\nvisibility. Data points were fitted according to (2), and the results are\nshown in full lines; parameter values are \u03bb = 0.2, 0.15, 0.12, 0.11,\n0.09, 0.0009 (from bottom to top) and \u03c30 = 1.0\nPDF function for the same image at lower resolutions (with\nan adequate rescaling of the pixel separations R).

Data\npoints are fitted to a straight line by a least-square method\nnificant differences appear down to images with resolutions\nlower than 150 \u00d7 117 pixels, where the details of the brush-\nwork are lost.\nWe can take the analogy with fluid turbulence further. By\nconsidering the large length scale as L = 2000 pixels, which\nis size of the largest eddy observed in the Starry Night, in\nFig. 6a we show a log-log plot of the statistical moments\nwith n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from bottom to top), which show,\nin each case, a power-law behavior. This can be confirmed\nby a least-square fit of each curve; the straight lines indi-\ncate the least-squares fit to the range of scales limited by the\ntwo dashed lines in the plot. In Fig. 6b, the scaling expo-\nnent \u03ben, of the first nine statistical moments are shown as a\nfunction of n. Although the data points in the figure can be\nfitted with great accuracy to a straight line it would imply a\nsimple scaling consistent with a self-similar picture of turbu-\nlence (i.e. Sn(R) = \u221dR\u03ben ) but no with intermittence, and we\nare comparing with the PDF\u2019s shown in Fig. 1, derived from\na model that assumes intermittence. This apparent conflict is\nremoved since scaling exponents show deviations from the\nself-similar values as indicated by the error bars. To deter-\nmine scaling exponents and error bars, we follow the method\nproposed in Ref. [14], based on local slopes.\nThe PDF of luminance, for a given R, shown in Fig. 5\nwere fitted according to (2) using a trial and error method.\nThe results, shown in the same figure with black lines (back\n280 J Math Imaging Vis (2008) 30: 275\u2013283\nFig. 7 Fragments of Starry\nNight (top) and its respective\nPDF of luminance fluctuations\n(bottom) for pixel separations\nR = 5, 10, 40, 80, 150, 250\n(from bottom to top)\nthe calculated PDF\u2019s which are in colors), yield a notably\ngood fit. Parameter values are \u03bb = 0.2, 0.15, 0.12, 0.11,\n0.09, 0.0009 (from bottom to top). In all the cases we con-\nsidered \u03c30 = 1.0. Finally, Fig. 6c shows the dependence of\n\u03bb2 on ln(R) for the six PDF\u2019s shown in Fig. 5. As expected,\nthe parameter \u03bb2, decreases linearly with ln(R).\nFrom his earliest years as an artist van Gogh was fond of\nlandscapes involving \u201ctroubled\u201d skies but it was not until his\nfirst days in the Saint Paul de Mausole Asylum that he used\nvigorous swirling brushwork to depict these turbulent skies\n(notably Mountainous Landscape Behind Saint-Paul Hospi-\ntal painted at early June of 1889). It is interesting to note that\nin most landscapes with stormy skies the powerful swirling\nstyle extends to the overall painting. This is more evident\nin the Starry Night were even the mountains and the village\nof Saint-R\u00e9my show a circular brushwork. The analysis of\nStarry Night presented above, and summarized in Figs. 5\nand 6 was carried out in the overall painting but portions of\nthe painting were also fed into the analysis with no signif-\nicant changes. As an example, in Fig. 7 we show two frag-\nments of the painting and its respective PDF of luminance\nfluctuations, for pixel separations R = 5, 10, 40, 80, 150,\n250 (from bottom to top).\nFrom van Gogh\u2019s 1890 period, we analyzed Wheat Field\nwith Crows, which is one of his last paintings. Admired and\nover-interpreted, this painting is also an example of vital-\nity and turbulence derived from each brush stroke. To per-\nform the luminance statistics we use a digitized, 300 dpi,\n5369 \u00d7 2676 image obtained from The Van Gogh Museum,\nin Amsterdam, provided by Art Resource, Inc. Figure 8\nshows the PDF for pixel separations R = 10, 40, 80, 150,\n250, 350 (from bottom to top). As it can be seen, the curves\nalso show close similarity to the behavior of the PDF of fluid\nturbulence.\nThe same similarity is found in another landscapes of this\nperiod. Road with Cypress and Star, was painted in May 12\u2013\n15, 1890, just after the last and most prolonged psychotic\nepisode of van Gogh\u2019s life, lasting from February to April\nof 1890 [15]. In Fig. 9 we show the PDF of this painting for\npixel separations R = 2, 5, 15, 20, 30, 60 (from bottom to\ntop). We use a digitized, 300 dpi, 815\u00d71063 image obtained\nfrom the WebMuseum, Paris, webpage. Just throughout the\ncourse of this February to April episode van Gogh painted\nTwo Peasant Women Digging in Field with Snow (March to\nApril, 1890) which also displays turbulent luminance; the\nPDF, calculated from a digitized 576 \u00d7 450 image, is shown\nin Fig. 10, for pixel separations R = 7, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150\n(from bottom to top).\nFrom the results, we deduce that the distribution of lu-\nminance on a given painting determines if it is turbulent.\nNevertheless, it is not evident what are the particularities\nof this distribution of luminance that produces a turbulent\npainting. Albeit this topic is still under research, some words\ncan be said here. Turbulence is a multiscale phenomenon\nand thus the appearance of eddies at different scales is a\nnecessary condition. These are observed in all the analyzed\npaintings and it is even more evident in the Starry Night.\nThe presence of several scales is not, however, a sufficient\nJ Math Imaging Vis (2008) 30: 275\u2013283 281\nFig. 8 Wheat Field with Crows\n(top) and its PDF (bottom) for\npixel separations R = 10, 40,\n80, 150, 250, 350 (from bottom\nto top). The image was taken\nfrom the WebMuseum-Paris\nwebpage\nFig. 9 Road with Cypress and\nStar (left) and its PDF (right) for\npixel separations R = 2, 5, 15,\n20, 30, 60 (from bottom to top).\nThe 815 \u00d7 1063 image used for\nthe calculations was taken from\nthe WebMuseum-Paris webpage\ncondition; paintings such as Cottages and Cypresses: Rem-\niniscence of the North (March-April, 1890) or Wheat Field\nUnder Clouded Sky (July, 1890) display eddies at different\nscales but their PDF curves depart from what is expected (al-\nthough in the former case the departure is not substantial).\nAn interesting property of the paintings that we analyzed is\nthe presence of an admixture of smooth variations and sharp\ntransitions of luminance. This may produce an effect that\n282 J Math Imaging Vis (2008) 30: 275\u2013283\nFig. 10 Two Peasant Women Digging in Field with Snow (top) and\nits PDF (bottom) for pixel separations R = 7, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150\n(from bottom to top). The 450 \u00d7 576 image used for the calculations\nwas taken from the Foundation E.G. B\u00fcrle Collection webpage, and\nreproduced with permission\nvan Gogh himself described to his brother Theo when re-\nferring to the clouds and mountains of the Starry Night [16]:\n\u201ctheir lines are warped as that of old wood\u201d (letter 607, writ-\nten 19 September, 1889). If it is so, a blurring process on the\ndigital image may lead to a gradual reduction of the turbu-\nlence. To study this effect, we used the digital image of the\nStarry Night, reduced in size to speed up calculations (we\ncommented that no significative differences are observed af-\nter reducing image sizes). Figure 11 shows the PDF of a\n1375\u00d71771 image, whose luminance was blurred using the\nimage manipulation software GIMP [17]. It can be observed\nthat in fact PDF curves depart from what is expected but we\ncan not claim that this is the explanation (or the only one)\nbut may give a clue to understand from where this turbulent\nFig. 11 PDF of a 1375 \u00d7 1771 image of the Starry Night, whose\ngray-scale version was blurred using the software GIMP, for pixel sep-\narations R = 15, 60, 100, 150, 200, 300 (from bottom to top)\neffect comes from. Further study of this topic is currently\nunderway.\n6 Conclusion\nIn summary, our results show that Starry Night, and other\nimpassioned van Gogh paintings, painted during periods of\nprolonged psychotic agitation transmitted the essence of tur-\nbulence with high realism. We use digital images of these\npaintings to show that the statistics of luminance contains\nthe characteristic fingerprint of turbulent flow, according to\na mathematical theory of turbulence based on the statistical\napproach developed by A. Kolmogorov. The analysis of the\nluminance of a painting presented here may be a useful tool\nfor the relatively new field of using quantitative objective\nresearch for analyzing artwork.\nAcknowledgements We thank Rafael Quintero for useful discus-\nsions.
