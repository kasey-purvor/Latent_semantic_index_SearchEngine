Recent reports demonstrate up to 6% optical to electri-\ncal power conversion efficient organic photovoltaic devices\ndesigned using the bulk heterojunction architecture.1 How-\never, to increase the power conversion efficiency \u0001\u0001\u0002 beyond\nthe envisaged market entry figure of 10%, further enhance-\nment of the photovoltaic device properties, such as short cir-\ncuit current \u0001Jsc\u0002, open circuit voltage \u0001Voc\u0002, and fill factor, is\nessential. Incorporation of semiconducting nanocrystals,\nwhich demonstrate size dependent band gaps into organic\nphotovoltaics, can potentially increase the light absorption\nfrom a wider part of the terrestrial solar spectrum. Such\nhybrid photovoltaic devices demonstrating light harvesting\nup to 1600 nm region have so far been reported in the\nliterature.2 These devices, however, operate at lower \u0001\nmainly due to poor charge transport properties of the nano-\ncrystals and unfavorable energy level offsets between the\ndonor-acceptor active layers. In an attempt to rectify these\nshortcomings, promising device architectures consisting of\nsmall molecule organic dyes \u0001pentacene\u0002 and infrared ab-\nsorbing PbS nanocrystals \u0001ns-PbS\u0002 have been investigated.3,4\nAlternatively, power conversion efficiency of organic photo-\nvoltaic devices can be increased by enhancing exciton disso-\nciation at the heterojunction through nanostructuring. Recent\nreports indicate up to twofold increase in the Jsc of\npentacene \/C60 bilayer devices nanostructured by a technique\ninvolving nanoimprinted lithography \u0001NIL\u0002.5 We report in-\ncorporation of the NIL technique to increase the device per-\nformance of the pentacene\/nc-PbS hybrid device architec-\nture. We observe that Jsc increases remarkably by two orders\nof magnitude after nanoimprinting, which is attributed to an\nincreased in the charge mobility within the hole transporting\nlayer. It is proposed that alternative phenomena, such as in-\ncreased exciton dissociation, are not facilitated by the im-\nprinting conditions used for this work.\nTwice sublimed pentacene \u000199.99%\u0002 was purchased from\nH.W. Sands and used without further purification. nc-PbS\nwere synthesized with a narrow size distribution according to\na method reported by Hines and Scholes.6 Prior to device\nfabrication, the oleic acid ligands of nc-PbS were exchanged\nto shorter butylamine ligands. To perform ligand exchange,\nthe dots were dried under nitrogen flux and then resuspended\nin an excess of butylamine \u0001Fluka, 99.5%\u0002.7 Subsequently,\nthe nc-PbS were dissolved in toluene at a concentration of\n50 mg \/ml for device fabrication. Devices were fabricated on\nindium tin oxide \u0001ITO\u0002 coated \u0001100 nm\u0002 glass substrates; ul-\ntrasonically cleaned using a three stage process in toluene, an\naqueous surfactant solution and acetone. Discrete heterojunc-\ntion photovoltaic devices were fabricated in a stratified\nmethod, starting with the sublimation of pentacene under\nvacuum \u00011\u000210\u22125 Torr\u0002 at a deposition rate of \u00050.1 nm s\u22121\non to precleaned ITO coated glass substrates. Subsequently,\nthe deposited pentacene layer was nanoimprinted using a\nNIL system \u0001Obducat AB, Sweden\u0002 at 4 MPa applied pres-\nsure utilizing a laser textured silicon stamp.5 A 50 mg \/ml\nnc-PbS solution in toluene was spin cast onto the nanoim-\nprinted pentacene layer at 700 rpm. Afterward, devices\nwith an active device area of 8\u201310 mm2 were fabricated\nby evaporating an Al top contact. Reference pentacene\/nc-\nPbS photovoltaic devices were fabricated without nanoim-\nprinting.\nA KrF Lambda Physik excimer laser \u0001LPX 210i\u0002, oper-\nating at 248 nm with 25 ns full width half maximum pulse\nduration, was used for nanostructuring \u0005400 nm thick amor-\nphous silicon film on glass which was used as the imprinting\nstamp for this work. A 4\u000210 mm2 excimer laser pulse with\nan asymmetrical peak profile along the length and a constant\nenergy along the width was scanned along the long direction\nover the sample. The steeper edge of the pulse was used\ndeliberately as the leading edge to increase the surface\nroughness.8 The samples were irradiated in air, mounted on a\ntranslation stage for large area irradiation. A 0.2 mm overlap\nwas maintained between the two scan lines, resulting in a\nuniformly nanostructured 2.5\u00022.0 cm2 nanocrystalline Si\nstamp. The 222 mJ cm\u22122 laser pulse was scanned at\n2.5 mm \/s with varying pulse repetition rate.

The stamp\nfabricated at 40 Hz which was used for imprinting penta-\ncene, resulted in 1114 nm average height and 559 nm rms\nroughness. The scanning electron micrograph shown in Fig.\n2 shows the uniformity of the features obtained from laser\ntexturing.\nCurrent density-voltage \u0001J-V\u0002 characteristics of the im-\nprinted and reference hybrid devices are shown in Fig. 3.\nImprinted pentacene\/nc-PbS device demonstrates a Jsc of\n0.27 mA \/cm2, which is two orders of magnitude greater than\nthe reference pentacene\/nc-PbS device \u0001Fig. 3, inset\u0002. The\nVoc is also observed to be noticeably increased by 0.17 V\nafter nanoimprinting. Interestingly, Jsc of an imprinted\npentacene-only device \u0001ITO\/pentacene\/Al\u0002 \u00010.008 mA \/cm2\u0002\nwas smaller than the Jsc of a reference nonimprinted\npentacene-only device \u00010.013 mA \/cm2\u0002, as shown in Fig.\n4\u0001a\u0002. The reduction after imprinting can be due to several\nreasons, including vacuum break during processing for the\nimprinting stage. However, the pentacene\/nc-PbS device\nshows marked improvement in performance compared to\npentacene-only devices, suggesting that the effect of nanoim-\nprinting of pentacene is beneficial only when used in a het-\nerojunction system. Therefore, to understand the mechanism\nof Jsc improvement by nanoimprinting of the pentacene\/nc-\nPbS hybrid device, comparison is carried out to an alterna-\ntive heterojunction pentacene \/C60 system.5 The improve-\nment of Jsc of pentacene\/nc-PbS cell \u0001two orders of\nmagnitude\u0002 upon nanoimprinting is significant compared to\nFIG. 1.

From Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002, it can be\nseen that under forward bias \u0003area shown by a circle in Fig.\n4\u0001b\u0002\u0004, both imprinted and reference pentacene \/C60 devices\nshow nearly identical J-V characteristics \u0001coincidental dark\nand white square plots\u0002. This observation is contrary to\npentacene\/nc-PbS devices which are clearly evident from\nFig. 4\u0001b\u0002. The imprinted pentacene\/nc-PbS device demon-\nstrates higher current densities in forward bias, by an order\nof magnitude compared to the reference device \u0001Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002:\ndark and white circle plots\u0002.\nThe postnanoimprinting increase of the short circuit cur-\nrent in the pentacene \/C60 devices were attributed to the in-\ncreased interfacial area facilitating enhanced charge dissocia-\ntion. It was observed that when imprinted using a stamp\nhaving an average height \u0001rms roughness\u0002 of 23\u00019\u0002 nm, the\npentacene film morphology converted from a relatively\nsmooth film at 27\u00016\u0002 nm to a textured one at 48\u000116\u0002 nm,\nindicating increase of the active surface area.5 However, the\nlaser textured Si stamp used for pentacene\/nc-PbS device\nfabrication demonstrates a significantly greater average\nheight of features \u0001rms roughness\u0002 of 1114\u0001559\u0002 nm. In order\nto quantify surface modifications after imprinting, AFM was\nperformed on 75 nm thick pentacene films deposited on ITO\ncoated glass and imprinted with an identical imprinting pro-\ncess used for pentacene\/nc-PbS device fabrication. The aver-\nage height and rms roughness of the as-deposited pentacene\nfilm were measured as 18.6 and 4.3 nm, respectively. The\nimprinted pentacene results in an average height of 18.3 nm\nand an rms roughness of 3.9 nm, which are extremely close\nto the as-deposited film\u2019s values. Therefore, interfacial area\nimprovement in pentacene\/nc-PbS after nanoimprinting can\nbe regarded as insignificant. Hence, an alternative phenom-\nenon must occur for the observed Jsc improvement of\npentacene\/nc-PbS devices upon nanoimprinting.\nIt has been reported that changes in interatomic\nspacing through applied high pressures result in changes in\nelectronic properties of acenes, both theoretically and\nexperimentally.9\u201311 The ncrease of mobility has been re-\nported for pentacene at hydrostatic pressures in gigapascal\nrange.9 In order to investigate possible changes in carrier\nmobility, C-AFM was performed on 75 nm as-deposited and\nimprinted pentacene films as per AFM analysis. The average\nand rms currents of the as-deposited pentacene films were\nmeasured as 29.9 and 19.4 pA, respectively. For imprinted\npentacene, the average and rms currents show a fivefold in-\ncrease at 163.9 and 96.8 pA, respectively. This result is clear\nevidence that conductivity of pentacene films improve upon\nnanoimprinting with large aspect ratio stamps. Hence, a hy-\npothesis can be put forward to explain the increase in the\nphotocurrent in the nanoimprinted hybrid devices by propos-\ning that the dramatic increase of the Jsc of imprinted\npentacene\/nc-PbS, as compared to a reference, is caused by\nthe increase of the charge mobility within the pentacene\nlayer by nanoimprinting.\nA careful analysis of the stamp used for the work using\nSEM and AFM allows calculating the effective localized\npressure applied on pentacene films during imprinting. AFM\nanalysis of the stamp shows that the average feature height is\n1114 nm. From the electron micrographs, the average base\ndiameter of the features can be calculated as 2170 nm. As-\nsuming a conical shape for the features, and counting the\nnumber of features in a known area, the planer area of the\nstamp at 75 nm \u0001thickness of pentacene used\u0002 from the top\nwas calculated to be 1.4% of total area of the stamp. Since\nthe pressure applied on the stamp during the imprinting pro-\ncess is 4 MPa, the effective pressure at each tip calculates to\nbe 0.286 GPa as a minimum value. This result is consistent\nwith the work reported by Rang et al., who demonstrated\nhydrostatic pressure induced increase in photoconductivity\nin single crystal pentacene films up to 0.3 GPa, caused by\nthe increasing overlap of the adjacent molecular orbitals\ncaused by pressure induced decrease of the intermolecular\ndistances.9 Increased mobility allows for thicker acene layers\nin organic photovoltaics, which would aid improved effi-\nciency due to enhanced light absorption. Furthermore, the\npotential for other electronic applications is significant such\nas organic thin film transistors. Thin film transistors with\nvery thin organic layers maybe possible with significantly\nimproved performances.\nIn conclusion, nanoimprinted pentacene\/nc-PbS hybrid\nsolar cells were fabricated using excimer laser textured sili-\ncon stamp resulting in two orders of magnitude higher short\ncircuit current densities. The improvement of the device per-\nformance is attributed to the improved electronic transport\nproperties of the imprinted pentacene layer due to localized\nhigh pressures leading to decrease intermolecular distances\nof the small molecule organic film.\nThis work was supported by the Portfolio Partnership\nAward from EPSRC, U.K. The authors acknowledge Dr.\nThierry Lutz for providing PbS quantum dots for this work.\n1J.
