To confuse matters, any specific study may need to take account of specific\nknowledge within subdisciplines, such as organisational management and technology transfer, and\nof knowledge within the domain of application (e.g. nursing, social work, fashion, etc.). Researchers\nmust build a consistent model of knowledge that can integrate disparate methodologies, research\ngoals and even conflicting interpretations of the same terminology. Without this, the ICTE research\nfield will be dominated by what is simply novel, irrespective of the relevance of particular changes\nto educational practice. If existing models in this field are as limited as suggested by Moule, when\nshould lecturers and teachers, with no motivation to use technology for its own sake and no addi-\ntional financial support, review progress in this field for effective examples of innovative practice, let\nalone wide-scale change? On most of the criteria that could be introduced to compare two papers,\nthe views of Moule and Salmon appear almost diametrically opposed and a detailed comparison\nwould seem of limited value. Instead, this paper asks a more fundamental question: what could be\nthe basis within this research community for establishing coherence within the field and ensuring\nthat research can justify actual changes in educational practice?\nIntroduction\nProviding a critical analysis of research literature that lies between the views of Moule\n(2006, 2007a, b) and Salmon (2000, 2007) would demand far more space than this\nbrief commentary will allow, but, as the intention is to foster debate and discussion,\nit makes more sense for detailed consideration of individual aspects to be considered\nby later contributors. The present article, instead, is intended to suggest that a\nnumber of critical factors must be considered in any subsequent discussion to ensure\nthat the debate fosters developments in this field towards the establishment of reliable\noutcomes for educational practitioners to adopt (cf. Hargreaves, 1996), rather than\nexperimental or innovative, practice (Rogers, 1962). Questions will be examined\n*Kingston University, Learning Technology Research Group, Penrhyn Road, Kingston upon\nThames, London KT1 2EE, UK. Email: cptompsett@king.ac.uk\n176 C. Tompsett\nnecessarily in turn, within the dialogical format of this paper, but that oversimplifies\nthe underlying theme. Questions regarding the construction of knowledge itself are\ninherently circular: the processes of research and education are implicitly entwined\nwith the nature of knowledge and how it can be learned. Some further issues can only\nbe raised; in relation to these, pointers are given towards more detailed discussions\nthat exist elsewhere. The intention is therefore to create a \u2018playground\u2019 within which\ncolleagues can discuss these two papers, always allowing, if need be, for others to\nremodel the playground itself.\nRemember education?\nThe rate of technical development in information and communication technology\nproduces an ephemeral research agenda in ICTE. Complex and critical research ques-\ntions are raised with one particular technology but disappear as researchers gain fund-\ning to test new ideas without resolving the issues that limit the potential value of\nprevious work to educational practice. The current interest in m-learning, for example,\neither acts as a replacement for wired technology (a technical rather than educational\nproblem) or else reduces the emphasis on visual attention, when full-size screens and\nexisting interface devices remain hopelessly inadequate in many subjects. While such\nwork is necessary in the first stages of development, the constant changes in the research\nagenda leave much started and little complete. Even where research in ICTE works\nspecifically within an educational environment, and suggests that educational improve-\nment has been achieved, it is far too common for \u2018improvements\u2019 to be attributed to\nthe technological change rather than the many other educational changes that may\nalso have taken place. These improvements are, of course, invalidated, if the measures\nof improvement themselves are different from those already used (MacFarlane, 2004).\nIf there was little disparity between this community\u2019s conception of ICTE, and that\nof those in education, there would be little need for MacFarlane\u2019s suggestion that all\nresearch teams should include both educators and technologists.\nThis disparity is emphasised when distinctions that would be understood in educa-\ntion become lost within this research community. When juxtaposed with instructiv-\nism, constructivism appears as a coherent position but, when applied within\neducation, it hides a multiplicity of meanings. Laurillard (2004), for example,\nsuggests 13 different models of constructivist education. Some interpretations may\nprovide subtle distinctions, or reflect a change in context, but other differences entail\na radically different model of knowledge, learning and education and the interrela-\ntionship between these concepts. Laurillard\u2019s selection would not cover the full set\ncovered in ICTE, let alone education. Activity theory (Engestr\u00f6m, 1991; Engestr\u00f6m\net al., 1999) would need to be included, as it is a key socio-constructivist position that\nremains distinct from but complementary to the views of Vygotsky, Lave and Wenger\n(see Lave & Wenger, 1991, p. 31). Similarly, Chomsky would need to be added to\ncomplement the views of Piaget and Papert (see Piattelli-Palmarini, 1980).\nResearchers in ICTE might also benefit from a number of systematic reviews and\nmeta-studies that have been published more extensively within the education field.\nTipping into the abyss 177\nThe benefits of peer-group discussion and networked learning are clearly difficult to\nestablish (for example, Andrews et al., 2002; Goldberg et al., 2003; Hogarth et al.,\n2005). A careful analysis of these reviews\/studies provides interesting examples of\nwhat not to repeat, what is required to establish educational benefits and to provide\nbenchmarks for the standard of research that can be achieved.\nWhy sociology?\nFor those who are striving to integrate the most recent innovations in ICTE, such as\npodcasts and the semantic web, it may also seem unusual to insist that due attention\nis given to sociological issues in research. However, the reasons to do so increase from\nyear to year. For the educationalist, \u2018blended learning\u2019 and \u2018work-based learning\u2019\nblur the self-evident separation (for those in educational practice) that students are\neither studying, working or \u2018not studying\u2019 (i.e. living). For the technologists, the\nincreasing focus on delivering solutions through technology to the new generation of\ntechnologically aware \u2018screenagers\u2019 (Watson, 2006, p. 10) depends on understanding\nthe sociological function of such technology. The interest that each student may\nshow in self-selected web-logs or the individual collection of performances that are\nstored on an MP3 player may well be remarkable, but there is no socio-cultural justi-\nfication that the same interest will transfer when the freedom to choose content is\nremoved and\/or dictated by some other agent. Even if the same enthusiasm were to\nbe transferable, researchers seem unwilling to discuss the inherent limitations that\nrestrict the quality and range of content when compared with alternative modes of\ninteraction and delivery (with or without technology). At the very least, a socio-tech-\nnical approach (Checkland & Scholes, 1991) is required to understand the way in\nwhich each group of users (educators, support staff and students) are likely to react\nunless \u2018required\u2019 to do so. In the latter case, an even wider research framework is\nneeded to understand how such \u2018requirements\u2019 may be legitimated or flouted (see,\nfor example, Latour, 1992).\nSelecting an appropriate critical framework for sociological modelling may seem\narbitrary, when first encountered, since some of the most critical terms, such as\n\u2018community\u2019, are defined in contradictory ways. In exchange theory (and also action\nresearch), the characteristics of a community must be determined by the choices made\nby each of the individuals. In a functionalist model, a community may acquire inde-\npendent characteristics above and beyond those that follow from its members. If we\ninclude socio-constructivist models, whether Vygotskian, activity theoretical or\ncommunities of practice (respectively Wertsch, 1985; Engestr\u00f6m, 1991; Wenger,\n1998), then the primary focus on the individual over the community is reversed.\nWenger (1998), for example, only addresses individuality after five chapters on prac-\ntice. Each of these models determines the objects that can be observed within the world,\ntheir potential properties and the possible relationships between them. These then\ndetermine how knowledge is established and shared, the relevance of existing research\nto the current problem and, from this, the extent to which any results from this project\nmay be relevant to future projects. If \u2018communication\u2019 is only researched in terms of\n178 C. Tompsett\ncommunication within a discussion group but cannot capture informal discussions and\nconversations, then the researchers will be blind to interactions that could be far more\nsignificant in educational terms (for example, Steyn & Cronje, 2006). If the behaviour\nof scientists \u2018in the laboratory\u2019 is observed to the same level of detailed analysis as other\ncultural groups, it becomes clear that social controls and unscientific arguments are\nas common and entrenched as in any other hierarchical professional group. The post-\nhoc, rationalised descriptions that are published in scientific journals simply report\nwhat a scientist is allowed to report (Latour & Woolgar, 1986).\nAs some critical terminology (e.g. community, constructivist) has markedly differ-\nent connotations depending on the approach chosen, it is incumbent on those report-\ning the research to ensure that these differences are presented coherently within the\npublished literature. Failing to do so can, in extreme cases, lead to terms becoming\nmeaningless; for example, with the concept of the DELPHI methodology in decision\nsupport (Dalkey & Helmer, 1963; Linstone & Turoff, 1975; Hasson et al., 2000;\nMitroff & Turoff, 2002). Avoiding this problem requires that there is consistency\nbetween the problem, model and methodology within the research\u2014and clarity of\nreporting for the relevant readership. A pick-and-mix approach, or lack of awareness\nof the issues that need to be managed within almost all of the approaches, opens the\nsuggestion that such research is unaware of the critical issues that affect learning\nwithin a technological society.\nReflexivity\nAlthough there is insufficient room to review all of the wide range of issues that are\nconsidered within a properly conducted sociological study, one particular issue\ncannot be ignored\u2014since it is introduced as soon as a study expects to account for\nany factor that influences human behaviour beyond the purely clinical. If a researcher\nbelieves that some set of properties, personal or social, affects how subjects report,\nlearn and reflect new learning in their behaviours or interactions with others, then the\nsame range of factors could influence the researcher(s) themselves\u2014the principle of\nreflexivity (Ashmore, 1989). At the simplest level this requires that the researcher is\naware of, and accounts for, their own influence on the research processes (reflective\nself-awareness\u2014the researcher as a non-independent observer; Ashmore, 1989,\np. 32). At a more fundamental level (and frequently missed in most such studies), it\nis generally unsound to conduct research in which the relationship between actions,\nlearning and knowledge that is expected to apply to any subjects is distinct from that\napplied to researchers themselves (reflective self-reference; p. 32). Merrill et al.\n(1996) proposed a laboratory study comparing individual with group-based learning,\nbut failed to note that some aspects of group inter-activity might be lost when infor-\nmal interactions were transferred to artificial environments and scheduled times so\nthat they could be \u2018observed\u2019. Alsop and Tompsett (2006) provide a more detailed\nanalysis of this issue in the case of phenomenography.\nIn ICTE, as well as in education, additional levels of inconsistency may be intro-\nduced between knowledge in the domain, models of assessment and models of learning\nTipping into the abyss 179\n(Wenger, 1998, epilogue)\u2014and even between course design and models of student\nlearning. Dirckinck-Holmfeld et al. (2004) provide one of the few cases within the\ncommunity of practice model in which consistency has been achieved. In contrast,\nZuber-Skerrit (1992) provides some cases within the action research model where\ncourse designers clearly apply one model to themselves and a different one to their\nstudents. Some contradictions may be unavoidable, but that does not remove the need\nto recognise that they exist and to address them within the research process.\nConclusions\nThe differences in perspective, approach and scope of the work of Gilly Salmon and\nPam Moule cover a considerable range of viewpoints regarding the nature of\nresearch in this field, and there is a risk that a continuing discussion might result in\nrevealing differences within the community that are interesting from the \u2018intellectu-\nalist\u2019 position (Oancea, 2005) but that are of little value to those engaged in educa-\ntional practice. For those in educational practice, even if research progresses\nbeyond the simply technological, innovative work is seldom pursued to the point at\nwhich effectiveness is sufficiently proven to justify a change in practice (Alsop &\nTompsett, 2007). These two opposing views provide an opportunity to discuss and\nreassess the future of research in this field. If there are to be rules for the debate,\nthen this author would argue strongly that the aims and principles of education\nand sociology need to become embedded as centrally as technology is at present.\nWithout that, research in this community will become increasingly self-focused,\nleading to improvements in a virtual reality that are incapable of influencing educa-\ntional practice in a real world.\nReferences\nAlsop, G. & Tompsett, C.
