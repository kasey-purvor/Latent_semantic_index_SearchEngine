INTRODUCTION\nB EFORE the introduction of the carburized, thoriated,tungsten cathodes, continuous wave (CW) magnetrons\nand in particular cooker magnetrons had particularly noisy\nspectra [1]. The poor noise performance was partly attributable\nto ion emission from the cathode [2]. Work sponsored by the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and\nthe Department of Energy (DOE) in the late 1970s revealed\nthat magnetrons with carburized, thoriated, tungsten cathodes\nhad very low noise levels when operated from well-filtered dc\npower supplies and with the cathode heater current turned off\n[3]. The interest in this case was to beam electrical power to\nearth from a solar satellite farm. Achieving this necessitated\nphasing the output of a large number of efficient, low weight,\nmicrowave generators.\nThe phase locking of oscillators and in this case magnetrons\nis important whenever one wishes to combine the output of a\nnumber of devices. This is of particular interest to industrial\nprocessing where it is not possible to economically build and\noperate 2.45-GHz magnetrons with outputs greater than a few\ntens of kilowatts.\nThe noise performance of high-power oscillators is a key\nfactor relating to how easily they are phase-locked and how\nunwanted emissions interfere with communications equipment\nand surrounding electronics.\nIt is well known that the phase and, hence, the frequency of an\noscillator and indeed a magnetron can be locked by an injection\nManuscript received May 10, 2005; revised June 24, 2005.

Menninger.\nThe authors are with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Lancaster\nUniversity, Lancaster LA1 4YR, U.K. (e-mail: a.dexter@lancaster.ac.uk).\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/TED.2005.854276\nsignal [4]\u2013[7]. The injection power required to achieve locking\nincreases with the square of the frequency difference between\nthe injection signal and the natural frequency of the oscillator.\nTemperature changes and power supply ripple make the band-\nwidth of a free running magnetron too large for locking with an\ninjection signal to be economic as compared to using an ampli-\nfier to generate a phase-locked signal.\nIf a magnetron is to be phase locked with a very low-power\ninjection signal it is necessary to control its natural frequency of\noperation. Nominally, there are four ways by which the natural\nfrequency of a magnetron can be varied and tuned. The first is\nwith tuning stubs in the anode cavities, the second is by varying\nthe reflected power back to the magnetron (pulling), the third is\nby varying the current through the magnetron (pushing) and the\nfourth is by varying the magnetic field.\nOf these tuning methods, the most rapid is by exploiting the\npushing effect. In this paper the pushing characteristic is uti-\nlized in a rapid control loop to lock the frequency. The pulling\ncharacteristic is then used to manually tune the magnetron to\nthe required power output. With the frequency constrained to\na small bandwidth, a small reference signal injected into the\noutput waveguide can then be used to lock the magnetron phase.\nII. MAGNETRON PUSHING CHARACTERISTIC\nWhen the dc voltage applied to a magnetron is increased\nfrom zero and before the magnetron starts to deliver power, a\nsubsynchronous charge layer develops around the cathode [8].\nWhen a pi-mode electromagnetic oscillation starts to build in\nthe slow wave structure, waves develop on this charged layer.\nThe crests of the waves become synchronous with the electro-\nmagnetic wave so that the crests are adjacent to the positively\ncharged vanes at phases when the fields across the gaps between\nthe vanes are at a maximum. As the height of the waves in-\ncreases, the effective capacitance between the anode and the\ncathode increases and the natural frequency of the magnetron\ndecreases [9].\nAs the waves grow they develop into the familiar magnetron\nspokes. When they reach the anode, the current path between\ncathode and anode is complete. Current must of course flow be-\ntween the cathode and the anode for the tube to deliver power. At\nthe operating point when the magnetron starts to deliver power\nand at the phase (instant) of maximum field across the gaps, the\nspokes are adjacent to the positively charged vanes. At this po-\nsition the RF field is perpendicular to the orbital velocity of the\nelectrons and hence very little power is transferred to the RF\n0018-9383\/$20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

From this operating point, as the cathode voltage is made\nmore negative, the spokes accelerate as a consequence of the\ncrossed static magnetic field. The spokes move to an advanced\nposition, i.e., at the phase of maximum field across the gaps, the\nspokes are advanced with respect to the positively charged vanes\n(and closer to the negatively charged vanes). In this position the\nelectrons in the spokes see a de-accelerating circumferential RF\nfield and hence deliver power to the RF field.\nThe crossed RF field with the static magnetic field causes\nthe electrons to drift closer to the anode as required by energy\nconservation. As the power output from the tube increases, the\nspokes move further in advance of the positively charged vanes\nat the phase of maximum retarding field. This movement away\nfrom the vanes decreases the effective capacitance between the\nanode and the cathode. The effect of this is that the frequency\nof the magnetron output increases. This is the pushing effect. It\nshould be noted that the frequency of the RF output from the\ntube depends on electric oscillations of the loaded slow wave\nstructure and not the angular speed of the charged spokes.\nThere is a small time delay between the application of the\nincreased voltage and the spokes settling to their new position.\nThe frequency of the loaded slow wave structure is tied to the\nposition of spokes. The current through the spoke is determined\nby its position and the RF field. Consequently the frequency\nis instantaneously related to the current rather than the applied\nvoltage.\nThe frequency of the slow wave structure also has a strong de-\npendence on its temperature. As the current increases the anode\nblock collects more energetic electrons, it gains temperature and\nexpands. For many CW magnetrons the frequency shift associ-\nated with temperature variation is of the same order of magni-\ntude as the change due to the pushing effect. For a dynamical\nanalysis of the magnetron it is a reasonable approximation to\nwrite\n(1)\nwhere is the instantaneous frequency, is the instantaneous\ncurrent in the external circuit, is the anode block temperature\nand gives the functional dependence. A more precise analysis\nwould include separate temperatures for the anode block and the\nanode vanes.\nNormally pushing curves are given without reference to the\ntemperature hence different results are obtained if different\ncooling regimes are used. The frequency control loop for this\nwork needs to act faster than thermal changes hence it is the\nconstant temperature pushing curves that are relevant here.\nOnce a magnetron has been frequency locked it is straight-\nforward to record current against temperature for constant fre-\nquency. It is then possible to construct pushing curves for con-\nstant temperature. When a magnetron is operated at constant\ncurrent rather than being frequency locked, the frequency span\nis so large that it can be difficult to accurately measure the\nfrequency shift as the magnetron anode heats up. Fig. 1 gives\npushing curves for the Panasonic Magnetron 2M137 1.2 kW\ndriven from a dc supply with the heater power optimized for\nlow noise. Here, the temperature has been measured on the outer\nFig. 1. Constant temperature frequency pushing curves.\nFig. 2. Experimental arrangement for magnetron locking.\nbody of the anode. At 300 mA, the variation in frequency be-\ntween 50 C and 90 C is about 2 MHz. The expected variation\nof frequency associated with thermal expansion of the anode\nis given approximately as the expansivity of the copper anode,\ntimes the temperature rise, times the frequency which gives 1.6\nMHz for a temperature rise from 50 C to 90 C.\nIII. PLL CIRCUIT\nPhase locking has been demonstrated using Panasonic and\nNational Magnetrons 2M137, 2M107, NL10254. Frequency\ncontrol and phase locking was achieved through the control\nloop sketched in Fig. 2 To study PLL frequency control inde-\npendently of injection locking, the injection amplifier is turned\noff.\nThe challenge for frequency and phase locking is to achieve\nand maintain locking for indefinite periods of time in the pres-\nence of power supply fluctuations and thermal drift. To demon-\nstrate this the chosen power source was a switched mode power\nsupply with minimal filtering of the dc input. Standard opera-\ntion for a switched mode power supply would be to vary the\npulsewidth so as to maintain either constant current or constant\npower. In our implementation, the pulsewidth is varied to con-\ntrol for constant frequency.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Magnetron spectrum without PLL control and with full heater power\n(68 W).\nPhase frequency detection was implemented with a low-cost\nADF4113 ic. The output of this chip is a series of current pulses\nwhose length is proportional to the phase difference. The mea-\nsured phase difference can be up to where is the division\nratio of the input signal. The division ratio for the 10 MHz\nreference signal was set as 50 for most of the work thereby per-\nmitting frequency adjustments in steps of 200 kHz. The division\nratio is then determined as the required magnetron frequency\ndivided by 200 kHz.\nThe loop filter acts as a proportional\/integral controller and\nhence determines how the switch mode power supply\u2019s output\nvaries in response to a phase error. An offset was added to the\noutput of the loop filter so that on power up and before the phase\ndetector receives an input, the switched mode power supply gen-\nerates a small anode current sufficient for the magnetron to start\n(70\u201380mAat4300\u20133900Vdependentonfilamentheaterpower).\nThe absolute reference was provided by a 1 ppm, 10 MHz\ntemperature compensated, crystal oscillator. The chosen fre-\nquency of operation is programmed by the microcontroller\nthat sets division ratios for the frequency dividers in the two\nADF4113 ics. A double-balanced mixer is used to give inde-\npendent phase measurements at the microwave frequency.\nControllers used were first-order and second-order type II pas-\nsive filters. Their transfer functions were optimized by standard\ntechniques [10].Thedc input for theswitchedmodepowersupply\nwas derived from rectified mains with minimal filtering of the\nripple as would be appropriate for a low cost industrial supply.\nEffectivenessof thePLLcanbedemonstratedby its ability tovary\nthepulsewidth of thechopperon theswitchedmodepowersupply\nto maintain a relatively constant output current and voltage with\nevidence of the 100\u2013Hz ripple greatly reduced. Small modula-\ntionsof thecurrentandvoltagegive theprecise frequencycontrol.\nIV. NOISE PERFORMANCE\nFig. 3 shows the output spectrum of the 2M137 magnetron at\na power level of 1 kW and with a relatively high heater power as\nmight be set for a typical heating application without PLL fre-\nquency control or injection locking. The power supply was oper-\nated with constant pulsewidth on the modulator rather than con-\nstant current hence the spectrum includes effects associated with\nmains ripple. The spectrum is much broader than one would pre-\ndict from the pushing curves together with the observed\nanode current ripple.\nFig. 4. Magnetron spectrum without PLL control and with 34 W heater power.\nFig. 5. Magnetron spectrum without PLL control and with 17-W heater power.\nFig. 6. Magnetron spectrum without PLL control and with 8.5 W heater power.\nThe noise performance depends strongly on the heater power\nrelative to the power output. As the heater power is reduced\nthe broad band spectrum narrows until at low heater powers the\nspectrum is composed of a number of well defined bands. This\nis illustrated in Figs. 4\u20136.\nIn the figures, RBW stands for the resolution bandwidth of\nthe spectrum analyzer. This was set to 200 kHz for Figs. 3\u20135\nand 20 kHz for Fig. 6.\nFig. 6 suggests that the magnetron jumps between discrete\nfrequencies following the natural frequency that shifts with the\n100 Hz ripple. Individual spectral peaks have bandwidths of the\norder of or less than 50 \u2013 100 kHz. Were the magnetron to be run\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Magnetron spectrum with PLL frequency control and with 34 W heater\npower.\nat this operating point from a constant current power supply with\nzero ripple and after the magnetron\u2019s temperature has stabilized,\none would see a single peak.\nFor the magnetron operating with 68 W of heater power the\nanode voltage was 3900 V, the anode current 0.293 mA and\nthe efficiency (RF power out divided by dc power plus heater\npower in was 62%). For the magnetron operating with 8.5 W of\nheater power the anode voltage was 4080 V, the anode current\n0.289 mA and the efficiency (RF power out divided by dc power\nplus heater power in was 60%).\nIn order to achieve PLL frequency control, it is necessary to\nreduce the noise and frequency spread below the levels associ-\nated with Fig. 3. For the 2M137 magnetron, locking becomes\npossible as the heater power drops to about 40 Watts, which is\nthe heater level associated with Fig. 4. Fig. 7 shows spectral per-\nformance when PLL control is applied at this point.\nFig. 8(a) and (b) shows the spectrum of a PLL frequency\ncontrolled magnetron with a further reduced heater power of\n17 W, but plotted on different spans. The 3-dB bandwidth is\nabout 50 kHz. The phase here is not locked and this is con-\nfirmed by double balanced mixer measurements. With PLL fre-\nquency control and when the heater power is reduced to zero\nthe magnetron has a tendency to cut out after several minutes of\noperation.\nFig. 9 shows return currents from the magnetron anode for\nthree different operating conditions including that of Fig. 8\nplotted as a percentages along side the percentage 100-Hz\nripple on the 325-V dc input to the power supply chopper.\nThe mains ripple is an asymmetric triangular wave by virtue\nof our 50-Hz mains power supply having flattened sinusoidal\npeaks. The largest waveform in the figure is the anode current\nripple when the PLL is not activated and current pulses from\nthe chopper have constant width. This is the full current ripple\nassociated with the 325-V dc input. Were the magnetron to be\nphase locked as a current controlled oscillator, one would expect\na very smooth anode current. When the PLL is activated, the\nactual anode current still shows a significant residual level of\n100-Hz ripple (introduced by the dc input).\nThe heater is driven by a 50-Hz ac supply and consequently\nwhen heater power is applied evidence of 50-Hz ripple appears.\nThe PLL now works to reduce this ripple along with the 100-Hz\nripple.\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 8.

Anode current ripple against 325-V dc supply voltage ripple for\nmagnetron with and without PLL frequency control and heater power.\nThe anode current also has a small level of 40-kHz ripple\nthat the control loop is unable to follow. The magnitude of this\nripple on the anode current was difficult to measure directly be-\ncause the power supply was inducing significant voltages on the\nground plane.

This means that the control voltage after the\nloop filter is given as\n(4)\nwhere is the resistance and the capacitance of the RC loop\nfilter and is an offset voltage needed for start up.\nThe power supply can be regarded as a current source with\na large internal resistance that adds ripple in proportion to the\ncontrol voltage hence\n(5)\nwhere is the power supply current to the magnetron, is\nthe fractional ripple and is determined by the power supply, its\ncontrol circuitry and its buffer amplifier.

For the control\nloop to work with the 40\u2013kHz switched mode power supply, the\ncurrent needs to be adjusted at least several times as swings\nfrom zero to a peak value.\nThe control loop defined by (7) has two natural periods, the\nunder damped period\n(13)\nand the over damped period\n(14)\nboth of which need to be less about than 1\/16 of the 40 kHz\nchopper frequency, i.e., less than 2.5 kHz.

Frequency locking was easily\nachieved for a range of values of at and above 8 nF.\nUsing the minimum , the phase error predicted by (12) for\na 5% mains ripple at 100 Hz becomes 1.56 rad. This is\nthe phase error at the PLL phase detector frequency of 200 kHz.\nThis translates to a phase error of 1.9 radians at the reference\nfrequency close to 2.45 GHz. It is apparent therefore that phase\nlocking cannot be achieved with this level of mains ripple by the\nmethod described. Experimentally, the measured phase error for\nPLL control for our system was never less than radians.\nVI. INJECTION LOCKING AND PLL FREQUENCY CONTROL\nBy introducing a locking signal into the output waveguide\nof the magnetron, whose frequency is already controlled by the\nPLL (phase measured at 200 kHz), it is possible to get phase\nlocking of the magnetron to that of the reference (phase mea-\nsured at 2.45 GHz) with very small power levels whilst subject\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Magnetron spectrum with 100-mW injection signal, PLL frequency\ncontrol, and zero heater power.\nto approximately dB of 100 Hz and dB of 40 kHz\npower supply ripple.\nInjection locking of a magnetron can be understood by the\nfollowing sequence of events. If a small injection signal, at the\nsame frequency as the magnetron frequency, but at an earlier\nphase, is introduced into the output cavities of the magnetron,\nthen it adds to the oscillation already there, bringing the overall\nphase forward by an amount very much less than the phase dif-\nference between the signal and magnetron.\nThe magnetron spokes see the RF field at an earlier relative\nposition and hence, refocus to this earlier position. As the spokes\nhave moved backward so that the negatively charged spokes are\ncloser to the positively charged vanes at the instant of maximum\nretarding field, the effective capacitance has increased. By the\nsame mechanism for the pushing effect, this increase in capaci-\ntance causes the frequency to decrease.\nWith the magnetron now oscillating at a very slightly lower\nfrequency, the phase of reference can catch up. A similar argu-\nment follows for the case when the reference starts in advance\nof the magnetron phase.\nThe dynamics of the injection locking process are difficult to\nmodel in a simple way. Our experimental results will show that\nthe dc power supply ripple gives a small phase offset, but unlike\nthe offset predicted for frequency locking by varying the anode\ncurrent, the injection locked offset is proportional to this ripple.\nVII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS FOR INJECTION LOCKING\nThe injection locking signal was derived from the 10\u2013MHz\nreference by using a second ADF4113 ic to drive a z-comm\nvoltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) V800ME11 at 2.45 GHz\nas shown in Fig. 2. Careful design is needed to ensure that the\nsignal from the magnetron does not get to the control input\nof the VCO via the 10 MHz reference. It is essential that the\nquality of the 2.45-GHz reference signal be monitored while the\nmagnetron is energized to be sure that measurements from the\ndouble balanced mixer are meaningful.\nFig. 10 shows the spectrum for the magnetron, injection\nlocked with a signal of 100 mW over a span of 100 kHz.\nSpectra plotted for injection levels of between 1 W and\n50 mW on the same span are almost identical. The dB\npeaks at kHz and 43.5 kHz are associated with\nripple from the power supply chopper. If the injection level is\nreduced to 20 mW the noise floor rises to dBm across the\n100-kHz bandwidth shown in the figures\nFig. 11. Magnetron spectrum with 500-mW injection signal, PLL frequency\ncontrol, and zero heater power.\nFig. 12. Magnetron spectrum with 50-mW injection signal, PLL frequency\ncontrol, and zero heater power.\nFig. 13. Injection signal spectrum.\nFigs. 11 and 12 show the spectrum for the PLL + injection\nlocked magnetron with injection signal levels of 500, and\n50 mW, respectively, and over a span of 2 kHz. At the injection\nlevel of 50 mW, the 100-Hz side bands are only 10 dB below\nthe center.\nFig. 13 gives the spectrum for the injection signal measured\nwhile the magnetron was energized. The injection signal shows\nthe 100-Hz ripple that exists on the magnetron spectrum but re-\nduced to a level of dBm. The presence of this ripple oc-\ncurs as a result of pick-up on the VCO input. The pin on the\nADF4113 carrying the feedback from the magnetron is physi-\ncally very close to the pin going to the 10 MHz TCXO oscillator.\nThis pin is also connected to the second ADF4113 that controls\nVCO providing the injection signal.\nUsing a Tektronics TDS6804B 8 GHz bandwidth, 20-GHz\nsampling rate digital storage oscilloscope, it has been possible\nto record waveforms corresponding to the injection locked\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

The\ndata has been recorded with a persistence of 50 ms so that the\nfigures give a sample of waveforms captured over this period.\nInput noise causes variation in the trigger point and hence the\napparent frequency jitter on the injection signal is much larger\nthan one would infer from spectrum of Fig. 13.\nFig. 14 corresponds to Figs. 10 and 11. Fig. 16 corresponds to\nFig. 12. The figures illustrate how the phase locking performance\ndeteriorates as the injection level is reduced. The small divisions\nin Figs. 14\u201316 represent a phase angle of 22.5 . It is apparent that\nmeasured reference signal starts with a phase variation close 22 .\nThe measured phase variation for the 500-mW injection signal\nis double this value at about 45 .

This implies that a simple dynamical\nmodel describing magnetron injection locking would give a first\norder control loop. This is exactly the case for Adler\u2019s treatment\nof an injection locked oscillator. He gave the relationship\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Injection locking makes the phase error much\nsmaller and hence the PLL loop gain becomes too small for the\nmains ripple to be removed by its action.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nThis paper paves the way for the development of high-power\nmicrowave supplies for industrial processing by combining\npower from a number of smaller units. Scalable power supplies\nallow smaller tubes to be mass-produced at low cost. It has\nbeen shown that most of the phase error for the injection locked\nmagnetron follows the mains ripple. Where several magnetrons\nare to be driven from the same mains supply, they would be\nsubject to the same mains ripple and hence the relative phase\ndifferences would be much less than the absolute phase differ-\nences to the reference.\nThe investigation here has been constrained to the perfor-\nmance for a single type of power supply. It is of interest to con-\nsider now how different levels of ripple and changing load con-\ndition affect the locking performance. Recent work by Neculaes\net al. [11] has indicated that there is scope for improving the in-\ntrinsic noise performance of CW magnetrons. The techniques\nsuggested may well allow systems to be created with a substan-\ntially more robust locking performance at the to dB\ninjection level.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors wish to thank B.
