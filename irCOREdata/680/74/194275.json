INTRODUCTION \nThe protection offered to individuals by remedies in public law and tort law is \ndeveloping in all jurisdictions. The past few years have witnessed an increas- \ningly important European dimension to the tort liability of public authorities. \nEuropean Union law and European Human Rights law have added to the \nconstitutional protection of tort claims against public authorities already estab- \nlished as a matter of domestic law in many European countries. \nIn this setting, English, French, and Italian courts have dealt with the liabil- \nity of banking regulators for lack of supervision of banks. Moreover, there has \nbeen parallel litigation before the English and French courts concerning liabil- \nity of the respective regulators for the failure of the Bank of Credit and \nCommerce International ('BCCI'). \nIn this article it is argued that the expansion of tort liability for misfeasance \nin public office in the House of Lords' recent decisions in Three Rivers \nDistrict Council v Bank of England1 may contribute to resolving possible \nconflicts with the European Convention of Human Rights. It may also reduce \nthe differences in the protection offered under English law and EU law. \nFinally, it is argued that when it comes to establishing limiting mechanisms \nreplacing the ones that have been eroded, English law may make good use of \nFrench and EU law. \nThis article is organised in the following way. In Part II, the framework for \nbanking supervision in the United Kingdom is examined, and the requirements \nfor liability under English law are set out. Liability under EU law in the BCCI \ncase is discussed in Part III. Comparative law material is introduced in Part IV, \nwith reference to parallel proceedings and developments in other European \njurisdictions. In Part V, some EU law issues are revisited, in particular.

ENGLISH LAW: STATUTORY IMMUNITY AND MISFEASANCE \nThe case of Three Rivers District Council v Bank of England2 arose out of \nalleged misfeasance by the Bank of England in supervising the Bank of Credit \nand Commerce International (BCCI). After BCCI went into liquidation depos- \nitors brought damages claims which were struck out in the High Court and \nCourt of Appeal.3 In the House of Lords, the first hearing was restricted to two \nquestions of law.4 The first question concerned the exact ingredients of the tort \nof misfeasance in public office. The way the relevant elements of this tort were \ndealt with, in four separate speeches, has not aided the process of clarification. \nIt illustrates the process of development of the law and also the uncertainties \nleft at this stage. The second question was whether the Bank of England was \ncapable of being liable in damages to the claimants for violation of \nCommunity law as laid down in the First Banking Directive.5 The House of \nLords held that the claimants did not have a damages remedy under \nCommunity law. \nThe second hearing before the House of Lords dealt with the question \nwhether it was right to strike out the claimants' action on the basis that there \nwas no reasonable prospect of the claim succeeding at trial.6 The strike out \napplication made by the Bank of England was rejected by a majority of the \nHouse of Lords.7 A crucial factor in their decision was the reliance, of the \njudge at first instance and the majority in the Court of Appeal, on the findings \nof the Bingham Report into the supervision of BCCI.8 Lord Hope said that \nBingham LJ was not in a position to conduct a fair trial of the issues relating \nto the tort of misfeasance in public office.9 He agreed with the dissenting opin- \nion of Auld LJ in the Court of Appeal that it would not be right to treat the \n2 Three Rivers District Council [2000] 2 WLR 1220; Three Rivers District Council [2001] \nUKHL 16. \n3 At first instance, after initial proceedings concerning various preliminary issues of law, \nClarke J acceded to the Bank of England's application to strike out the action (Judgment of 30 \nJuly 1997 (unreported)). The Court of Appeal upheld Clarke J's decision in a joint majority judg- \nment of Hirst and Robert Walker LJJ; Auld LJ dissented: Three Rivers DC v Bank of England \n[1999] EuLR 211. \n4 Three Rivers District Council [2000] 2 WLR 1220. \n5 First Council Banking Co-ordination Directive of 12 Dec 1977 (77\/780\/EEC). \n6 Under the transition arrangements guiding the introduction of the Civil Procedure Rules \n(CPR) in 1999, the question whether the misfeasance claim should be struck out was determined \naccording to the CPR: Three Rivers District Council [2001] UKHL 16, paras 12-13. \n7 The Bank of England asked the House of Lords to give summary judgment against the \nclaimants under Rule 24.2 CPR. Lords Steyn, Hope, and Hutton allowed the appeal against the \nstriking out of the claim. Lords Hobhouse and Millett dissented. \n8 Inquiry into the Supervision of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International HC Paper \n(1992-3), no 198. \n9 Three Rivers District Council [2001] UKHL 16, para 33 and 80. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 06:41:47 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nMisfeasance in Public Office 759 \nBingham Report as effectively conclusive on the questions that arose in the \nlitigation.10 Lord Hutton also agreed. He held it impermissible for the judge \nand the majority of the Court of Appeal, in deciding at this interlocutory stage \nwhether there was no real prospect of the action succeeding, to be influenced \nby the findings and conclusions of Bingham LJ.1 Disregarding for this reason \nthe conclusions in the Bingham Report, the majority held that it could not be \nsaid the claim had no real prospect of succeeding. The claim had to proceed to \ntrial. There are important statements, in particular in Lord Hope's speech, \nabout the elements of misfeasance which both aid the process of clarification \nand the development of the tort. \nThe main features of the UK model of banking supervision are briefly set \nout below. It is followed by an outline of the law on tort liability applying to \nthe Bank of England as banking supervisor. The scene is then set for the \ndiscussion of the Three Rivers case. \nA. The Reluctant and Immune Supervisor \nThe UK model of banking supervision remained a minimalist one under the \nresponsibility of the Bank of England. Until the adoption of the Banking Act \n1979 supervision was implemented on an informal basis12 with no compre- \nhensive legislative backing.13 The Banking Act 1979 created a statutory \nsystem for authorisation of all deposit-taking institutions. This was \nmodernised by the Banking Act 1987 which increased the Bank of England's \npower to regulate, vet controlling shareholders, and require information.14 In \n1988 the Bank published a Statement of Principles.15 The Statement lays \ndown in some detail the grounds for using the powers to revoke and restrict an \nauthorisation under the 1987 Act. \nThe protection of depositors was set out, in the long title of the 1979 and \n1987 Acts, as the prime objective of banking supervision. In contradiction to \nthis, the focus of a new ideology of banking supervision, prudential supervi- \nsion, became the solidity of financial institutions and payments systems. \nSupervision should prevent contagion and systemic risk that could threaten the \n10 Ibid, para 33 and 86. \" Ibid, para 132. \n12 Banking supervision was not without bureaucracy: there were many administrative permits \nand dispensations which had to be obtained if a full range of banking activities were to be attained. \nThis served more as a barrier to entry than a basis for real supervision. 'The underlying idea was \nto await the development of a new financial institution and then make a judgement', W M6schel, \n'Public Law of Banking' (1991) Int Enc Comp Law, vol IX, ch III, at para 20. \n13 The Bank never formally invoked the power of recommendation and direction contained in \ns 4(3) of the Bank of England Act 1946. The Bank's approach to supervision was that of a gentle- \nman's code of ethics and self-regulation. See G Penn, Banking Supervision (London: \nButterworths, 1989), 10-11. 14 Ibid, 15. \n15 The current Statement of Principles from 1998 was issued by the Financial Services \nAuthority and is complemented by the very extensive Guide to Banking Supervisory Policy. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 06:41:47 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n760 International and Comparative Law Quarterly \nstability of the banking system.16 The Bank of England developed this over \nthe years, partly in response to criticism over its handling of the different \nbanking crises,17 and partly in interaction with international standard setting. \nIn this new perspective, individual bank insolvency could be acceptable. \nIndeed, under certain circumstances, it might even promote the soundness of \nthe financial system.18 This redefinition created a clear tension in relation to \nthe Bank of England's statutory duties, both under domestic and EU law. \nThe change to modern methods of banking supervision19 and the develop- \nment of formal powers was a long and gradual process. This added another \ntension: the continued reliance on informal supervision after the establishment \nof a formal framework with legal duties and sanctions for breach of those \nduties. In the Bank's practice, omissions to make use of formal sanctions \ncould for instance be justified with market reactions.20 The Bank could omit \nto use sanctions where its 'moral suasion' failed, even though this contrasted \nwith the philosophy of the legislation and the Bank's own Statement of \nPrinciples.21 \nThe Bank of England Act 1998 followed yet another banking crisis, this \ntime ushering in radical reform. The 1998 Act transferred banking supervision \nfrom the Bank of England to the Financial Services Authority, an independent \nfinancial services regulator. The Bank of England retained certain functions in \nrelation to the supervision of banks' liquidity. \nIn terms of potential liability, a statutory immunity from damages liability \nwas introduced under the Banking Act 1987.22 Under the terms of the statute, \nliability may only arise if the impugned act or omission 'was in bad faith'.23 \n16 See the discussion of systemic risk in R Cranston, Principles of Banking Law (Oxford: \nOxford University Press, 1997), 71-2. \n17 See, for instance, the submissions by the Governor of the Bank of England and its other \nrepresentatives to parliamentary committees and the annual reports by the Bank on banking super- \nvision. \n18 The advantages for a banking supervisor are obvious. Compare systemic risk, which has not \nyet ever materialised in a systemic collapse, as the only standard of accountability with loss for \ndepositors, which occurs with most individual bank failures. \n19 See the discussion of these issues in Cranston, op cit, 91-2. \n20 For instance, it could be claimed that that the market would withdraw from a bank whose \nactivity was restricted. This could bring about the collapse of the bank with possible consequences \nfor the stability of the banking market. \n21 This is well documented in the Rt Hon Lord Justice Bingham's Inquiry into the Supervision \nof the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (HC Paper (1992-3), No 198) and in Report \nof the Board of Banking Supervision Inquiry into Circumstances of the Collapse of Barings \n(1995). At 260 of the latter Report it was noted that no in situ inspection ('visit') to Barings Bank \nwas ever undertaken before its collapse in 1995. \n22 Banking Act 1987, s 1(4). See now Sch 1, s 19(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act \n2000. For an in-depth analysis of UK law, see C Hadjiemmanuil, Banking Regulation and the Bank \nof England (London: LLP, 1996) and the more general discussion in Cranston, op cit, 91 et seq. 23 This immunity reaches further than restricting mechanisms in other European jurisdictions. \nIt is for instance undisputed that German regulators will be liable in negligence to the banks they \nsupervise. The possible restrictions in German tort liability are in relation to depositors, other \ncreditors and shareholders. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 06:41:47 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nMisfeasance in Public Office 761 \nRegardless of the statutory provisions, regulators have traditionally been well \nprotected by the common law. The cases concerning liability in negligence \nhave been restrictive and not imposed any duty of care upon regulators in \nrespect of economic loss.24 The cases concerning the supervision of financial \ninstitutions confirm this restrictive approach.25 Thus, the statutory immunity \nmay well have been superfluous in 1987. But as the common law develops, \nand tort liability expands, the immunity may become more important. \nThe statutory immunity is not applicable to acts taken in bad faith. This \nexception allowed for claims based on the tort of misfeasance in public office. \nMisfeasance in public office is the only specifically 'public law' tort in \nEnglish law.26 In the BCCI case the claims against the Bank of England were \nbased on the tort of misfeasance in public office, and the remedies under \nCommunity law. \nB. Misfeasance in Public Office: The Mental Requirements \nThe essence of misfeasance is the exercise of power by a public officer in bad \nfaith that causes loss to the claimant.27 The crucial element of this tort is the \nmental requirement, which may be divided into two alternatives. First, the \nmost stringent form of this tort is known as targeted malice. It requires proof \nthat a public officer has acted with the intention of injuring the claimant.28 The \nsecond form, untargeted malice, is made out when a public officer acts in the \nknowledge that he exceeds his powers, and that this act would probably injure \nthe claimant.29 \nThe focus of the litigation before the House of Lords in the Three Rivers case \nwas upon the second less stringent form, untargeted malice. In the House of \nLords, the debate over the mental element in misfeasance concerned two sepa- \nrate questions. The first question is the public officer's knowledge of the unlaw- \nfulness of his or her act. Must it be shown that the defendant knew or suspected \nthat the act was unlawful? Or is it sufficient to show that he ought to have known \nthat such was the case? Which of these differing standards is applicable? \n24 See, eg, Lam v Brennan [1997] PIQR P488 (planning control); Reeman v Department of \nTransport [1997] 2 Lloyd's Rep 648 (health and safety regulation). See discussion in H McLean, \n'Negligent Regulatory Authorities and the Duty of Care' [1988] OJLS 442; PP Craig and D \nFairgrieve, 'Barrett, Negligence and Discretionary Powers' [1999] Public Law 626 and 646. \n25 Yuen Kun Yeu v Attorney General of Hong Kong [1988] AC 175; Davis v Radcliffe [1990] \n2 All ER 536. \n26 See Bourgoin SA v MAFF [1986] QB 716, 776.

What is the requisite state of mind of the public officer concern- \ning the likelihood of the claimant being damaged by the unlawful act? The \nmanner in which the courts frame these elements is an essential part of under- \nstanding the role of the tort in controlling public wrongdoing. The mental \nelement of the tort is its main control-mechanism. \nThe first judgment of the House of Lords in Three Rivers resolved these \nquestions in the following way. On the knowledge of illegality, it was held that \nthe claimant must show either that the officer had actual knowledge that the \nimpugned act was unlawful or that the public officer acted with a state of mind \nof reckless indifference to the illegality.30 On the awareness of consequences, \ncounsel for the claimants had argued that that there was no need for it to be \nshown that the public officer had actually known that his actions would prob- \nably injure the claimants, arguing that recovery should be made for all reason- \nably foreseeable loss.31 This had been supported by Lord Justice Auld's \ndissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal.32 In the first judgment of the \nHouse of Lords, the test of reasonable foreseeability was rejected. The rele- \nvant test was subjective. It was necessary to show that the public officer knew \nthat his act would probably injure the claimant. As with the knowledge as to \nthe unlawfulness of the act, it would seem that reckless indifference as to the \nconsequences, in the sense that the officer acted without caring whether the \nconsequences happened or not, was sufficient. \nThe second judgment of the House of Lords applied the test to rule on the \nquestion whether the claim should be summarily dismissed. The House of \nLords stated that the correct test for misfeasance was that laid down in the first \njudgment.33 But the second judgment did more than illustrate the practical \napplication of the requirements of the tort. The second judgment provided \nimportant clarification of two aspects of the action, the necessary knowledge \nas to consequences in terms of untargeted malice, and the exact meaning and \nrole of bad faith. \n1. Knowledge as to Consequences \nThe formulation of the requirement to show knowledge as to consequences \nwill be a crucial point when the case goes to trial. The exact articulation of \nthese consequences cover disputed territory but essentially entail the knowl- \nedge or recklessness of the failure of BCCI, the lack of a rescue package to \nsave it, and the resultant loss of the depositors' money. \n30 Ibid. See also [2001] UKHL 16 ,para 121 (Lord Hutton) \n31 See argument in the Court of Appeal: Three Rivers DC v Bank of England [1999] EuLR 211, \n243. \n32 Three Rivers District Council [1999] EuLR 211, 270-2, 370 (CA). \n33 Three Rivers District Council [2001] UKHL 16, para 41. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 06:41:47 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nMisfeasance in Public Office 763 \nIn the second judgment of the House of Lords in Three Rivers,34 it was reit- \nerated that what is required is recklessness in a subjective sense of awareness \nof risk by the defendant.35 Inadvertent recklessness, in the sense of reasonable \nforeseeability, was not enough. But it was again repeated at various stages that \nthe test as to knowledge of the consequences covers reckless indifference to \nthe risk of loss,36 which extends to 'recklessness about the consequences, in \nthe sense of not caring whether the consequences happen or not, will satisfy \nthe test.'37 \nThe 'couldn't care less' test for recklessness as to consequences is elastic. \nOn one interpretation, it could imply advertence to the risk of the conse- \nquences occurring but accompanied by entire indifference to whether that \nhappened or not. This combines awareness with a lack of concern. Another \ninterpretation is more radical, and would cover the circumstances where the \ndefendant had not thought about the particular consequence of certain acts or \nomission and thus showed a practical indifference to their occurrence. This has \nsometimes been used in criminal law cases of alleged rape where the defen- \ndant has been convicted on the basis that he 'couldn't care less' whether the \nvictim was giving consent or not.38 There are those who believe that it hard to \nreconcile such an approach with the label of advertent or subjective reckless- \nness.39 \nCould there be grounds for arguing in favour of the broader interpretation \nin the context of misfeasance in public office? There are some indications in \nLord Hope's decision of a recognition of the inherent problems in taking too \nnarrow a view of foresight of consequences. This is highlighted in two partic- \nular features of his judgment. First, counsel for the Bank had argued that the \nclaim should be struck out on the basis that the statement of claim did not \nsupport an allegation of 'knowledge, belief or suspicion of likely or probable \nloss.' Lord Hope refused to strike out the claim on this basis, and emphasised \nthe importance of discovering the facts at trial before making specific defini- \ntions of the state of mind required.40 This suggests that the trial judge will have \na certain amount of room to manoeuvre in framing the exact test.

P Cane 'Mens Rea in \nTort Law' (2000) 20 OJLS 533, 542-3 takes this discussion further, and is less critical of the judi- \ncial process failing to distinguish between the required state of mind and the (factual) inferences \nthan Ashworth. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 06:41:47 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n764 International and Comparative Law Quarterly \nlater aspect of Lord Hope's judgment is also revelatory about the required \nstate of mind of the public officer. Lord Hope admitted that he saw much force \nin a section of Auld LJ's dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal which \nunderlined the iniquity of allowing the defendants to rely upon the reason for \ntheir unlawfulness-the failure to fulfil its supervisory obligations properly- \nto defeat the misfeasance claim on the basis that this very failure-its 'self- \nimposed ignorance'-precluded them from suspecting that the depositors \nwould probably suffer loss. \nAuld LJ's argument strikes right at the heart of requirement of foresight. \nDoes Lord Hope's recognition of the force of Auld LJ's comment imply a \nmore indulgent approach to claimants meaning that subjective awareness of \nrisk might not always be required? Most probably not. Given Lord Hope's \nbasic definition of recklessness for untargeted malice in which he emphasised \nthe awareness of risk, it would seem that the narrower interpretation of the \n'couldn't care less test' is right: it has to be shown 'that the public officer was \naware of a serious risk of loss due to an act or omission on his part which he \nknew to be unlawful but chose deliberately to disregard that risk'.41 But at the \nvery least, the approval of Auld LJ's statement suggests that at trial the judge \nshould draw the necessary inferences from any attempt that is made by the \nBank to make use of its self-imposed lack of prescience concerning the effects \nof its supervisory activities to defeat a claim for lack of foresight of conse- \nquences. \nA related issue is the degree of awareness of risk that will have to be \naverred by the claimants. The defendants had argued that there needed to be \nproof of awareness of probable loss. In response to this, Lord Hope underlined \nthat in the end this question was a matter of fact and degree to be determined \nby the judge at trial.42 In giving guidance for that process his Lordship \nacknowledged that an important consideration was that supervision was \nconferred by statute in order to protect depositors. The First Banking Directive \nwas premised upon this policy. Underpinning the supervisory system is the \nfact that in the absence of proper supervision, deposits are likely to be at risk. \nIn that context, Lord Hope expressed the test to be applied at trial as whether \nthe risk of loss was sufficiently serious to warrant a finding of reckless on the \npart of the supervisor.43 \n2. The Role of Bad Faith \nAnother important aspect of Lord Hope's judgment is the clarification of the \nexact meaning and role of bad faith. The first House of Lords' judgment had \n41 Three Rivers District Council [2001] UKHL 16, para 46. 42 Ibid, para 60. \n43 Ibid, paras 60 and 76. He also expressed this in terms of the following test: 'the public offi- \ncer was aware of a serious risk of loss due to an act or omission on his part which he knew to be \nunlawful but chose deliberately to disregard that risk' (para 46). \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 06:41:47 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nMisfeasance in Public Office 765 \nleft this question somewhat open. Counsel for the Bank of England argued that \nthe action should be struck out because the pleadings did not make specific \nallegations of dishonesty in the sense of subjective bad faith on the part of offi- \ncials of the bank.44 Lord Hope flatly rejected this argument.45 In effect he held \nthat proof of the elements of the tort in terms of knowledge of unlawfulness of \nthe act or omission and its consequences was enough.46 This is particularly \nimportant in terms of recklessness as to the consequences. It would seem that \nproof that the defendant did not care whether the consequences happened or \nnot is enough. Bad faith is demonstrated by recklessness on the part of the \nadministrator in disregarding the risk.47 Lord Hope emphasised that no addi- \ntional element of dishonesty or bad faith was required.48 \nThis is a significant point in favour of the claimants in the Three Rivers \ncase. It would probably have been difficult to show outright bad faith, over and \nbeyond the unlawfulness and consequences elements, on the part of the offi- \ncials in dealing with BCCI. Now, according to the majority judgment of their \nLordships this is no longer necessary. This clarification of the role of bad faith \nis also significant in a wider sense. It is sufficient to show disregard of a suffi- \nciently serious risk of loss, coupled with unlawfulness. This clarifies and \nbroadens the interpretation of bad faith. It will serve to make the tort of \nmisfeasance more broadly applicable for compensating administrative \nwrongs.49 Reckless administrators are a more common phenomenon than \noutright dishonest ones. \nWe will examine the ramifications of the re-shaping of the tort of misfea- \nsance in a later section. We turn now to examine the House of Lords decisions \nin respect of Community Law. \nIII. THE EU LAW ISSUES BEFORE THE ENGLISH COURTS \nA. EU Law in the UK Courts: The General Issues \nBanking supervision in the UK was for a long while fundamentally different \nfrom other EU member states. Even after many years of EU harmonisation, \nUK banking supervision remained minimalist, with the Bank of England as a \nreluctant supervisor. As we have seen, banking supervision was first put on a \nstatutory footing in the Banking Act 1979. The 1979 Act50 transposed into \nEnglish Law the newly adopted EU First Banking Directive.51 It was after the \nsecondary banking crisis of the early 1970s that the Bank of England had to \n44 Ibid, paras 57 and 62. 45 Ibid, para 62. 46 Ibid, paras 44 and 62. \n47 Ibid, para 44. 48 Ibid, para 62. \n49 For a restrictive interpretation of the bad faith requirement in the Court of Appeal, see Greville \nv Sprake [2001] EWCA Civ 234; Thomas v Chief Constable of Cleveland [2001] EWCA Civ 1552. \n50 See the useful overview of the regulatory system in Three Rivers District Council [2000] 2 \nWLR 15 (abridged) [1999] EuLR 211 (in full) CA. \n51 In particular, the First Banking Directive of 1977: First Council Banking Co-ordination \nDirective of 12 Dec 1997 (77\/780\/EEC). \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 06:41:47 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n766 International and Comparative Law Quarterly \naccept some degree of formalisation of banking supervision in EU legislation. \nThe UK had blocked the First Banking Directive but the objections to the \nproposal were then withdrawn.52 \nIn the BCCI case, the different standards of banking supervision in the UK \ncompared with those applicable in other European countries could potentially \nhave been an issue both in the context of the misfeasance claim and the claim \nfor breach of EU law. The tension between the requirements of the First \nBanking Directive and UK banking supervision could only have been appre- \nciated fully with this in mind. But this tension never became an issue in the \nproceedings or in the judgments. \nLiability under EU law was evidently attractive to the claimants, as it would \nhave avoided many of the restrictive mental elements required in misfeasance. \nIn the event, all three courts confirmed that misfeasance in public office is a \nnarrower tort than that based on a sufficiently serious breach of Community \nlaw. There was extensive discussion of the Community law issues. Only the \ndissenting judge in the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Auld, held that a claim \ncould be based on Community law. He held that EU legislation did impose \nduties on the Bank of England. The purpose was to protect depositors. The \nobligations imposed upon the Bank by the EU legislation could give depositors \na right of redress against it for breach of those obligations. \nIn the House of Lords, Lord Hope of Craighead gave the main speech on \nCommunity law issues.53 He relied on Lord Justice Auld for the formulation \nof the two critical questions.54 First, did the First Banking Directive entail the \ngrant of rights to individual depositors and potential depositors? Secondly, \nwas the content of those rights identifiable on the basis of the provisions of the \nDirective? \nLord Hope reviewed the European Court's case law on the First Banking \nDirective and he found little support there. He relied on an examination of the \nterms of the Directive itself. He pointed out that the recitals showed that it was \nintended to be the first step in a continuing process to coordinate the supervi- \nsion of credit institutions. He concluded that the protection of savings was \nmerely a matter to which regard had to be had, along with the creation of equal \nconditions of competition, in the process of coordination. \nLord Hope further held that the only duty that the First Banking Directive \nimposed was a duty to cooperate. When the Directive allowed the withdrawal \nof authorisation in limited circumstances, its terms were restrictive rather than \nobligatory: it could not place a duty to act on the Bank of England. Various \nissues arising from this judgment merit examination in greater depth. \nB. The Purpose of the Directive and the Duties on the Supervisor \nThe BCCI failure was the very type of failure that the First Banking Directive \n52 See Cranston, op cit, 70. 53 [2000] 2 WLR 1220, 1236. 54 Ibid, 1242. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 06:41:47 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nMisfeasance in Public Office 767 \nwas intended to prevent. BCCI operated in several member states at a stage \nwhen the coordination of banking supervision was being developed at a \nCommunity level. It is well documented that BCCI was allowed to continue \nits business for a long period due to coordination problems between the bank- \ning supervisors in different member states. \nThe First Banking Directive was intended to secure non-discriminatory \ntreatment of banks from other member states. This was effected by removing \ncertain forms of direct discrimination against foreign banks or initiating proce- \ndures, and by introducing the right to judicial review, for instance in the autho- \nrisation of banks. The opening up of the banking markets in the Directive was \naccompanied by certain safeguards to protect the interest of depositors. \nDepositors were to be protected by certain supervisory measures that should \nbe undertaken by national authorities. In particular they were to protect depos- \nitors from the problems of coordination between different national banking \nsupervisors. \nThis was the first step in establishing a new supervisory system in the \nCommunity. It is hard to accept the position taken in the judgment by the \nHouse of Lords that the Bank of England could not have a duty to make use \nof the powers to revoke an authorisation. It is hard to do so on the basis of a \nliteral interpretation. On the basis of the background for, and context of, the \nCommunity regulation of banking supervision it is even more difficult. The \nprovisions of the Directive must also be read in light of the supervisory \nsystems of the other member states that in effect were adopted as the \nCommunity model with these particularly fundamental consequences in the \nUK.55 \nLord Justice Auld in the minority in the Court of Appeal interpreted the \nprovisions of the Directive on supervisory duties in a way that is wholly \nconsistent with this context. He also made use of the case law of the Court of \nJustice on the Directive, including the ruling in the Parodi case.56 The other \njudges attempted to explain away these cases, one by one,57 with brief and \nmostly formal arguments. \n55 See the discussion of the supervisory systems of other member states by M Andenas and D \nFairgrieve, 'To Supervise or to Compensate', in Andenas and Fairgrieve, Judicial Review in \nInternational Perspective (London: Kluwer Law International, 2000). \n56 Societe Civile Immobiliere Parodi v Banque H. Albert de Bary et Cie (Case C-222\/95) \n[1997] ECR 1-3899; [1997] All ER (EC) 946, ECJ. Another interesting point concerns the French \ncourts' application of the ECJ's preliminary ruling which arguably is inconsistent with that of the \nHouse of Lords. That should have resulted in a new reference to the ECJ by the House of Lords. \nSee the Editorial in [2000] Euredia 305 signed by the Editorial Board under the title 'European \nBanking Law as Applied by the House of Lords: Overshadowing the Acte Clair Doctrine', and \nalso the case note in [2000] Euredia 379. \n57 In Dillenkofer [1996] ECR 1-4845 para 22 the condition that the directive conferred rights \non individuals was formulated in the following way: the result prescribed by the directive must \nentail the grant of rights to individuals and the content of those rights must be identifiable on the \nbasis of the directive. This formulation does not allow a national court to disregard the European \nCourt's case law on the interpretation of a directive! \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 06:41:47 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n768 International and Comparative Law Quarterly \nC. Damages and Direct Effect \nThe discussion of liability was in all three instances, from Mr Justice Clarke \nto the House of Lords, closely linked to the requirements for direct effect. As \nmentioned, Lord Hope in the House of Lords let liability depend on two \nuncontroversial questions.58 First, did the First Banking Directive entail the \ngrant of rights to individual depositors and potential depositors? Secondly, \nwas the content of those rights identifiable on the basis of the provisions of the \nDirective? But there are several places in Lord Hope's speech, as it is in the \nmajority judgments of the lower courts, where it seems as if the requirements \nfor tort liability include precision and unconditionality, which of course are the \nbasic requirements for direct effect.59 \nThe condition for tort liability that the directive conferred rights on indi- \nviduals60 does not go that far. The condition is that the result prescribed by the \ndirective must entail the grant of rights to individuals, and that the content of \nthose rights must be identifiable on the basis of the directive. This is different \nfrom the precision and unconditionality required for direct effect. \nIn the majority decisions of the English courts in the Three Rivers litigation \nthe requirement of the granting of rights to individuals has become materially \ndifferent from what is required according to the authoritative case law of the \nEuropean Court. \nIt could be noted here that the German Government proposed, under the \nnegotiations on the First Banking Directive, the inclusion of a clause stating \nthat the Directive did not give rise to liability in damages to depositors for the \nnational regulator. The European Commission opposed this limitation of \nliability. The Commission's view was that it would be inappropriate to limit \nin the directive the remedies provided in national law. Damages liability for \nbreach of Community law (as a matter of Community law) has of course been \nestablished later.61 The choice was made not to limit a possible liability based \non the requirements of the Directive.62 \nIV. PARALLEL PROCEEDINGS AND DEVELOPMENTS IN OTHER \nEUROPEAN JURISDICTIONS \nA. Proceedings in France \nThe English legal system is by no means the only system to have considered \nthe question of the liability of regulatory authorities. The French administra- \n58 [2000] 2 WLR 1220, 1242. \n59 Directly effective EU law can be relied on in national courts. Member States can be held \nliable in tort for breach of EU law whether the provisions of EU Law are directly effective or not. 60 This condition, established in the European Court's judgment in Dillenkofer [1996] ECR I- \n4845 para 22, was referred to in the judgments as 'the Dillenkofer condition'. 61 See Part V below. \n62 This was not brought to the attention of the English courts in the Three Rivers litigation. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 06:41:47 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nMisfeasance in Public Office 769 \ntive courts have also been grappling with similar issues, and the case law has \nbeen developing swiftly. \nDue to the complex and sensitive nature of bank supervision, the French \nConseil d'Etat traditionally required claimants to show faute lourde, or grave \nfault, in state liability actions concerning the activities of the main agency \nresponsible for banking supervision, the Commission Bancaire.63 The stan- \ndard of liability applied by the courts was particularly high,64 and only one \nclaim had ever satisfied this faute lourde requirement.65 \nThis restrictive approach has however recently been challenged by \nclaimants in a series of cases. In the case of Kechichian, depositors brought an \naction against the state alleging that the Commission Bancaire had failed to \nsupervise properly a bank, the United Banking Corporation, contributing to its \nfailure and the consequent loss of their deposits. At first instance, the claims \nwere rejected. On appeal, the Cour Administrative d'Appel de Paris reiterated \nthe principles enunciated in an earlier decision concerning the Bank of Credit \nand Commerce International,66 in which it had abandoned the traditional \nprerequisite of faute lourde and decided that the standard of faute simple \napplied to the supervisory role of the Commission Bancaire.67 The Cour \nAdministrative d'Appel thus continued the seemingly inexorable shift from \ngraded fault standards in French administrative law68 towards a unified stan- \ndard of faute simple.69 \nAn appeal was made to the Conseil d'Etat. The case was assigned to the \nAssemblee du Contentieux, the Plenary Chamber of the Conseil d'Etat denoting \nthe importance of the issues raised by the claims. In an extremely significant \njudgment, the Conseil d'Etat overturned the Cour Administrative d'Appel's \ndecision on the standard of fault.70 The claimants needed to show that the \nCommission Bancaire had committed afaute lourde in its supervisory activities. \n63 Conseil d'Etat, 29 Dec 1978, Darmont [ 1978] Recueil des Ddcisions du Conseil d'Etat, 542. \nOther agencies also exercised supervisory functions: see further D Fairgrieve and K Belloir \n'Liability of the French State for Negligent Supervision of Banks' (1999) 10 European Business \nLaw Review, 17. \n64 Cliquennois, 'Essai Sur La Responsabilit6 de l'Etat du Fait de Ses Activitds de Contr1le et \nde Tutelle' [1995] Les Petites Affiches, no 98, 4. \n65 This case is itself over 35 years old and relates to facts that took place in the 1950s.

The Commission Bancaire's failure to act deci- \nsively to ensure that the bank was re-capitalised within a short space of time,71 \nand its willingness to backtrack on initial requirements amounted to a faute \nlourde. For only the second time in its history, the state was found liable in \ndamages by the administrative courts for the loss caused to investors by the \ncollapse of a credit institution. However, the state was not found liable for the \nfull loss of these depositors. As the primary causal contributor of the bank's \nfailure was the fraudulent activities of its directors, the Conseil d'Etat held the \nstate solely liable for the part it played in the failure of the bank, which was \nheld to represent 10 per cent of the lost deposits. \nVarious conclusions can be drawn from this case. The Conseil d'Etat \ndecided that in this sensitive area of governmental activity the time was not \nright for a shift from faute lourde to faute simple. The protective role of faute \nlourde was still deemed necessary in order to provide a 'margin of manoeu- \nvre' for the public body.72 But it would be wrong to view this case as a simple \nre-statement of the previous case law. Indeed, it is possible to perceive it as a \nsignificant step forward. The traditional approach to claims in this area was \nvery restrictive and the standard of liability very high.73 It would not be exag- \ngerated to say that a form of quasi-immunity applied.74 The approach of the \nConseil d'Etat in the most recent case strikes a different note. Faute lourde \nwas maintained but the judges sent a signal that they are prepared to look \nclosely at the regulator's activities and will impose liability if the appropriate \nstandards are not met. The shift is illustrated by the difference in approach \nbetween the Tribunal Administratif and the Conseil d'Etat. Both applied the \nstandard of faute lourde but only the latter found that it had been made out.75 \nThe French case law also affords an opportunity to reflect upon the control \nmechanisms. The means of controlling the existence and extent of liability are \nby no means limited to the notion of fault. The French cases show that various \nother mechanisms exist. In the case of El Shikh, concerning the BCCI failure, \ndepositors complained that the French regulators had been at fault in the way \nthey supervised BCCI. It was alleged inter alia76 that the BCCI's banking \n71 Subsequent to the issuing of a formal 'lettre de suite', which had been motivated by an \ninspection which had uncovered weaknesses in the bank's finances. 72 Chapus, Droit Administratif General, vol 1, 13th edn (Paris: Montchrestien, 1999), para \n1463. \n73 Cliquennois, 'Essai Sur La Responsabilit6 de l'Etat du Fait de Ses Activites de Contr1le et \nde Tutelle' [1995] Les Petites Affiches, no 98, 4. \n74 Only one claim had previously satisfied the traditional faute lourde requirement. This case \nis itself over 35 years old and relates to facts that took place in the 1950s: Conseil d'Etat, 24 Jan \n1964, Achard [1964] Recueil des Ddcisions du Conseil d'Etat, 43.

Nonetheless, the case is still instructive in \nother respects. Despite the shift in the standard of fault, the claim against the \nFrench state by the BCCI depositors failed. Indeed, the court did not even \ndecide whether or not the Commission Bancaire's actions constituted a faute \nsimple.77 It instead rejected the claims on the basis that the causal link between \nthe alleged faults and the claimants' loss was not established.78 The Bank's \ncollapse was primarily due to fraudulent activities of its employees at the \nBCCI group level, and particularly at the Bank's principal place of business in \nLondon. There was no direct causal link between the allegedly deficient \nsupervision of the French branches of BCCI for which the French supervisory \nauthorities were responsible, and the claimants' loss. \nThe Conseil d'Etat's recent decision in Kechichian also illustrates that \ncreative solutions at the level of causation can allay fears of, in common law \nterminology, the opening of a floodgates of claims. The Conseil d'Etat \nreduced the liability of the State in line with the part it played in the failure \nof the bank, which represented 10 per cent of the ultimate loss. Moreover, the \nlower court's solution-though it proved unattractive to the Conseil d'Etat- \nmight be of interest from a comparative law perspective. In Kechichian, the \nCour Administrative d'Appel found that the inadequate supervision of the \nbank had played a causally significant role in its failure. But it considered that \nthat had only deprived the investors of a chance of avoiding the bank's \ncollapse. So, the damages award was assessed as 20 per cent of the losses of \neach depositor. \nB. Parallel Issues in German and Italian Law: Are Depositors Protected? \nIn traditional German doctrine,79 supervision of financial institutions was \nundertaken in the interest of the public at large and not to protect individuals.80 \nConsequently, individual depositors could not have any tort claim against the \nbanking regulator. This doctrine was premised upon a decision by the \n77 In respect of the parallel claim concerning the exercise of the Commission Bancaire's disci- \nplinary power, the French courts maintained the pre-requisite offaute lourde laid down in the case \nof Darmont in 1978 (n 63 above). The Court held that on the facts of the case the Commission \nBancaire did not commit afaute lourde. \n78 For a more detailed examination of this point, see Andenas and Fairgrieve, 'To Supervise or \nto Compensate?', op cit. \n79 F Ossenbtihl, Staatshaftungsrecht (Munich: Beck, 1998), 64. \n80 German law is of interest here as a background to the First Banking Directive. It is also \nnecessary to understand a point based on the legislative history of the directive concerning a \nproposed article in the Directive limiting liability to depositors (see under Part III above). \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 06:41:47 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n772 International and Comparative Law Quarterly \nBundesgerichtshof (Supreme Court) in a case concerning the supervision of \ninsurance companies.81 But in two decisions from 1979, Wetterstein82 and \nHerstatt,83 the Supreme Court departed from this doctrine. The Court recog- \nnised that individual bank creditors (Gldubiger), and this included depositors, \nrepresented a protected interest.84 Banking supervision was undertaken not \nonly in the general interest but also in the interest of individuals. In response \nto these cases, new legislation was introduced in 1984, stating expressly that \nbanking supervision is undertaken in the public interest only. This was \nintended to exclude claims from individuals. A statutory immunity directly \nbarring tort claims would be unconstitutional as Article 34 of the German \nConstitution prohibit such immunities.85 The only way open to the legislator \nwas to limit the purpose of banking supervision. \nIt is no surprise that the new legislation has been criticised by commenta- \ntors as both unconstitutional and contrary to EU law.86 If the 1984 legislation \nis primarily a limitation of liability, it cannot be constitutional. The question \nmay be more doubtful if the 1984 legislation is considered to be a real limita- \ntion of the primary functions and purpose of banking supervision. The limita- \ntion of liability that was intended by the 1984 legislation will not affect those \nwho are directly affected by an unlawful administrative act of the \nBundesaufsichtsamt such as banks or their management. Here the ordinary \nliability rules apply.87 \nThere is also interesting litigation before the Italian courts. In Italy, depos- \nitors have an unusual constitutional protection. Article 47 of the Italian \nConstitution (1948) provides that the state shall encourage and supervise \nsaving in all its forms. This article was adopted to impose a duty on the state \nto supervise banks in the interest of depositors. It influenced the language of \nthe Treaty of Rome, which in Article 57(2) required unanimity for the adop- \ntion of Community measures concerning the protection of savings. But it is \n81 BGH Z 58, 96 at 98. 82 BGHZ 74, 144 at 147. \n83 BGHZ 75, 120 at 122. In the Herstatt case the claimants were a group of private depositors. \nThe Gemeinschaftsfonds bzw. Feuerwehrfonds proved insufficient at the insolvency of the \nHerstatt-Bank in 1974. The response was the establishment in 1976 of the Einlagesicherungsfonds \ndes Bundesverbands der deutschen Banken, as an industry initiative to pre-empt legislation estab- \nlishing a public deposit guarantee scheme.

French distinctions such asfaute lourde could not be expected to pass review \nunder Art 34 GG. The Constitution does not, on the other hand, bar a limitation of the right of \nrecourse against the civil servant personally to a qualified form of negligence. 86 See also the discussion by WR Schenke and J Ruthig 'Amtshaftungsanspriiche von \nBankkunden bei der Verletzung staatlicher Bankenaufsichtsplichten', NJW (1994), 2324; and \nOssenbtihl op cit, 64 with extensive references. \n87 V Szagunn, U Haug, and W Ergenzinger, 6th edn, Gesetz iiber das Kreditwesen (Stuttgart: \nVerlag W Kohlhammer 1997), 170.

In the Consob case, the Corte di Cassazione, \noverturning old jurisprudence, extended the tort remedies available to deposi- \ntors and investors. \nV. TORT LIABILITY UNDER EUROPEAN COMMUNITY LAW \nThe impact of European Community law, even if it did not give rise to a \ndamages claim in this case, is of importance. In Brasserie du Pecheur and \nFactortame 91 the European Court of Justice clarified the conditions for liabil- \nity: 'Community law confers a right to reparation where three conditions are \nmet: the rule of law infringed must be intended to confer rights on individu- \nals; the breach must be sufficiently serious; and there must be a direct causal \nlink between the breach of the obligation resting on the State and the damage \nsustained by the injured parties.'92 \nThe notion of a 'sufficiently serious breach' was thus introduced by the \n88 Although the Corte di Cassazione did not actually decide on the issue of liability. After the \nSupreme Court's ruling in Cass 22 July 1993, n. 8181 in the case following the liquidation of the \nBanca Popolare di Fabrizia, the Tribunale di Roma, on the facts of the case, did not find in favour \nof the claimant. The Supreme Court held again in Cassa di Risparmio di Prato-Landini (Cass 27 \nOctober 1994, n. 8836) that the Banca d'Italia could be liable in damages to investors for lack of \nsupervision and that such claims fall within the competence of the civil courts. According to \nArticle 2043 of the Italian civil code, which also applies to the public bodies, 'any wilful or negli- \ngent act that causes an unjustified damage to another obliges the person who has committed the \nact to pay damages'. This covered only the infringement of someone's 'rights' and not their 'legit- \nimate interests'. A depositor would only have a legitimate interest in the supervision of the bank \nand not a right. In Cassa di Risparmio di Prato-Landini the possibility is opened up for granting \ndepositors rights in this sense, making a damages remedy available. Focus shifted to the right of \nthe integrity of their assets from the legitimate interest in the lawful use of supervisory powers. \n89 Cass Sez I, 3 Mar 2001, n. 3132. The new doctrine on tort liability for breach of legitimate \ninterests generally was established in the case reported as Cass SSUU, 22 July 1999, n. 500. A \ndamages remedy became available without having to reclassify the 'legitimate interests' as rights. \n90 See excellent discussion of this case, by Roberto Caranta, 'Public Law Illegality and \nGovernmental Liability' in D Fairgrieve, M Andenas, and J Bell (eds), Tort Liability of Public \nAuthorities in Comparative Perspective (London: BIICL, 2002). \n91 In Brasserie du Pecheur SA v Federal Republic of Germany; R v Secretary of State for \nTransport, ex p.

In a second generation of cases,93 the \nECJ has developed and refined the remedy, concentrating on elaborating the \ncondition of causation.94 \nIn Three Rivers, the House of Lords held that there was no Community \nright for depositors to be breached. There was no need to deal with issues of \ncausation. Causation, as with the other conditions of liability for breach of \nCommunity law, is determined in the first place by Community law. National \nrules of causation that do not provide an effective standard of protection will \nbe discarded. However, also outside the formal reach of Community law these \ncausation rules may be of assistance. In the context of expanding liability as a \nmatter of English law, one issue is the guidance that can be found in \nCommunity law, as in the French case law, on causation as a limiting mecha- \nnism. One starting point may be the rather stringent principles governing the \nliability of Community institutions,95 the other the evolving causation rules for \nMembers States' breach of Community law \nNeither did the House of Lords have to revisit the test of 'sufficiently seri- \nous breach'. When Lord Hope uses 'sufficiently serious risk', this is at an \nevidentiary level.96 However, the way in which this is done does bring misfea- \nsance liability under English law closer to the level of protection offered by \nliability under Community law. \nVI. THREE RIVERS: THE BROADER PERSPECTIVE \nThe decision in Three Rivers should be placed in the context of general devel- \nopments of tort law. Domestic tort remedies have been developing under the \ninfluence of European Human Rights Law and European Community Law,97 \n93 See Case C-424\/97, Salomone Haim v Kassenzahndirztliche Vereinigung Nordrhein, judg- \nment of 4 July 2000; Case C-140\/97, Rechberger and Greindl v Austria [1999] ECR 1-3499; Case \nC-321\/97, Ulla-Brith Andersson and Susanne Wdkerds-Andersson v Swedish State [1999] ECR I- \n3551; Case C-302\/97, Konle v Republic of Austria [1999] ECR 1-3099; Case C-319\/96, \nBrinkmann Tabakfabriken GmbH v Skatteministeriet [1998] ECR 1-5255; Case C-127\/95, \nNorbrook Laboratories Limited v Ministry of Agriculture [1998] ECR 1-1531. \n94 See Tridimas, 'Liability for Breach of Community Law: Growing up and Mellowing \nDown?', in D Fairgrieve, M Andenas, and J Bell (eds), Tort Liability of Public Authorities in \nComparative Perspective (London: BIICL, 2002). \n95 However, so far no apparent attempt has been made by the Court to borrow, in developing \ncausation rules for Member States' liability for breach of Community law, from its case law on \nArt 228(2) and liability for Community institutions with regard to causation, see the criticism by \nW Van Gerven, 'Taking Article 215(2) EC Seriously', in Beatson and Tridimas (eds), New \nDirections in European Public Law (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 1998), 35-48. \n96 Three Rivers District Council [2001] UKHL 16, para 60. The distinction between the \nsubstantive test and the evidentiary matters is an unclear one, also in the practice of the English \nappellate courts, see A Ashworth, Principles of Criminal Law, 180-1 and P Cane 'Mens Rea in \nTort Law' 542-3 (n 40, above). \n97 J Wright, Tort Law and Human Rights (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2001); B Markesinis, J-B \nAuby, D Coester-Waltjen, and S Deakin, Tortious Liability of Statutory Bodies: A Comparative \nand Economic Analysis of Five English Cases (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 1999); Amos, 'Extending \nthe Liability of the State in Damages' [2001] LS 1; PP Craig and D Fairgrieve, 'Barrett, \nNegligence and Discretionary Powers' [1999] Public Law 626. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 06:41:47 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nMisfeasance in Public Office 775 \nand the Three Rivers decision may be seen as part of this process. Comparative \nLaw may also be of assistance in this gradual development. The broadening of \nthe elements of misfeasance in public office may make this tort more attrac- \ntive to claimants. \nA. The European Context \nWe have already analysed the rejection of the Community law damages claim \nin Three Rivers. Despite this position, and the questionable way in which the \nEuropean cases were interpreted and the preliminary reference avoided, the \nEuropean law influence on the development of the English law tort of misfea- \nsance in the Three Rivers case should by no means be regarded as negligible. \nThere are signs of the influence of both European Community and Human \nRights Law in the decision. \nThere must scarcely be an area of English law that is untouched by the \ndomestication of European Human Rights Law. Financial services law might \nbe seen as a rare exception. The Three Rivers case shows how untrue this is. \nProcedural guarantees enshrined in Article 6 have already made their mark on \nthe architecture of financial services regulation,98 and it would seem that their \neffect is being felt in the most recent Three Rivers judgment. In the judgments \nof the majority in the House of Lords concerning the improper use of the \nBingham Report, repeated reference is made to the claimant's right to a fair \ntrial.99 Similar concerns are present when Lord Hope expresses his hesitance \nin striking out claims concerning complex issues of fact and law without \nexamination at trial. An explicit analogy was drawn with the right to a fair trial \nguaranteed by Article 6 of the European Convention when emphasising the \noverriding objective of the new procedural rules.100 Moreover, a statutory \nimmunity will of course be subject to a proportionality review under Article 6 \nECHR.101 \nAlso, Community law influences can be detected within Lord Hope's judg- \nment. In various key areas of his judgment, he acknowledged the influence of \nEuropean law in shaping the elements of the cause of action. In response to the \nfact-sensitive issue of the degree of risk of which the regulator must have been \naware, Lord Hope instinctively latched upon the test of a sufficiently serious \nrisk of loss.102 \nSupranational law is not the extent of potential European influence in this \nsphere. Developments at a national level in European jurisdictions may also \n98 J McDermott, 'Commercial Implications of the Human Rights Act 1998' (2000) BJIBFL \n449, 453. \n99 Three Rivers District Council [2001] UKHL 16, para 6 (Lord Steyn), 33 and 80 (Lord \nHope). 100 Three Rivers District Council [2001] UKHL 16, para 92. \n101 See, for instance, the recent decision by the European Human Rights Court in Al-Adsani v \nUnited Kingdom, Application no 35763\/97, judgment of 21 Nov 2001. 102 Three Rivers District Council [2001] UKHL 16, paras 60 and 76. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 06:41:47 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n776 International and Comparative Law Quarterly \nhave a role to play. The international and cross-jurisdictional nature of the \nregulation of banks makes this sphere, as we have already seen, particularly \nopen to the influence of comparative law. \nB. Role of Misfeasance in Governmental Liability \nIn controlling governmental wrongdoing, the tort of misfeasance has generally \nbeen distinguished from other torts by the need to show egregious intentional \nwrongdoing. This high level of required fault has limited its attractiveness to \npotential claimants who have instead preferred to rely upon the torts of assault, \nfalse imprisonment, and more particularly, negligence. \nA consideration of the future role for the tort of misfeasance must be placed \nin the context of the broadening of its constituent elements; developments \nwhich we have already examined above. Misfeasance is now an intentional \ntort for which recklessness suffices. Although the form of recklessness \nproscribed in the recent cases is not objective, as some awareness on the part \nof the defendant would seem to be required, the gap between this tort and the \ntort of negligence, premised upon the all-pervading notion of reasonable fore- \nseeability, has undoubtedly been narrowed. \nThis broadening of the mental element of the tort of misfeasance is not the \nonly explanation for its enhanced appeal to litigants. Three further points \nshould also be made. \n1. Requirement of Proximity \nIn order to succeed in an action based upon the tort of negligence, the claimant \nmust show that he or she was in a proximate relationship with the defendant. \nThis can prove to be a significant obstacle to recovery.103 \nThe exact role of proximity within the tort of misfeasance has been \ncontested. In the Court of Appeal decision in Three Rivers, the majority indi- \ncated that proximity was of relevance to misfeasance in public office,104 that \nit might play a limiting role where the number of claimants was large and \nalleged 'range of duty' was wide.105 However, the House of Lords took a \ndifferent view. The Court of Appeal's approach to proximity was rejected by \nLord Steyn and Lord Hutton.106 \nThis might make the tort of misfeasance in certain circumstances a more \nrealistic option to claimants than the tort of negligence, particularly where the \nclass of the potential claimants to which a duty of care in negligence would be \nowed is very broad. Indeed, in the case of banking supervision, the common \nlaw approach of the courts to negligence claims has been restrictive. In a \n103 See, eg, Capital & Counties plc v Hampshire County Council [1997] QB 1004. 104 Three Rivers District Council [1999] EuLR 211, 270-2 (CA). 105 Ibid, 270. \n106 Three Rivers DC v Bank of England [2000] 2 WLR 1220, 1233 and 1267. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 06:41:47 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nMisfeasance in Public Office 777 \nnumber of cases, it has been held that regulators owe no duty to depositors for \nwant of proximity.107 So, no duty may arise at common law, even if the regu- \nlators are shown to have acted in flagrant breach of their official duties. In \nsuch circumstances, misfeasance presents an alternative action against the \nwrongdoers. There will no doubt be other areas of public authority activity in \nwhich proximity has traditionally posed an obstacle to recovery in damages on \nthe basis of negligence, and in which misfeasance in public office may there- \nfore provide a remedy for instance in actions against the police. \n2. The Recovery of Economic Loss \nThe reluctance of the courts to allow the recovery of pure economic loss for \nnegligent wrongdoing is well known. There are important developments in \nmost jurisdictions, and since Brasserie du P&cheur v Germany and \nFactortame No 4 it has been clear that liability for breach of Community law \ncannot be limited to certain, individually protected individual interests.108 \nHowever, other than in restricted circumstances, the English courts preclude \nthe recovery of financial loss that is unconnected with physical damage to the \nclaimant's person or property.109 \nReluctance to allow claims concerning pure economic loss is one of the \nreasons for which the actions in negligence against financial regulators have \nfoundered in English law.110 However, this policy of caution has not-as \nyet-been extended to the tort of misfeasance in public office. It is no coinci- \ndence therefore that many of the leading misfeasance cases concern economic \nloss,111 of which Three Rivers is an example par excellence. Although the size \nand extent of the loss suffered by the BCCI depositors may have had some \nimpact on the framing of the tort in Three Rivers, it certainly did not have an \nexclusionary effect. This characteristic of the tort might draw its attention to \nthose who traditionally would have difficulties in availing themselves of a \nnegligence claim, such as disappointed applicants for commercial licences, or \nthose who have suffered loss due to adverse planning decisions. \n3. Exemplary Damages \nIn exceptional cases, the English courts can award punitive damages that are \n10o7 In the regulatory sphere, see Yuen Kun Yeu v Attorney General of Hong Kong [1988] AC \n175 (Privy Council); Cooper v Hobart, 2001 SCC 79 (Supreme Court of Canada). \n108 See the judgment of the European Court of Justice in Brasserie du P&cheur v Germany \n[1995] ECR 1-1029, at para 90, [1996] QB 404, at 504. 109 The major exception to this is the rule laid down in the case of Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v \nHeller & Partners [1964] AC 465. 110 See references to the spectre of indeterminate liability in Cooper v Hobart, 2001 SCC 79 \n(Supreme Court of Canada). \n\"1 Bourgoin SA v MAFF [1986] QB 716; Roncarelli v Duplessis (1959) 16 DLR (2d) 689 \n(Canadian Supreme Court). \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 06:41:47 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n778 International and Comparative Law Quarterly \ndesigned to express the court's disapproval of the defendant's exceptionally \nbad conduct.112 Until recently, the award of exemplary damages was limited \nby means of the 'cause of action test', restricting the grant of such damages to \nthose causes of action for which exemplary damages have been awarded prior \nto the case of Rookes v Barnard 113 in 1964.114 This rule precluded the award \nof such damages for negligence,115 breach of statutory duty,116 and misfea- \nsance in public office. However, in a recent case the House of Lords refused \nto strike out an action for the award of exemplary damages for misfeasance in \npublic office, rejecting the 'cause of action test' as a limiting factor upon the \naward of such damages.117 \nIt is not entirely clear what the position now is in respect of the other torts \nthat previously were not eligible for the award of punitive damages. Should \nthe position remain that negligence is excluded, then there would be an added \nreason for bringing an action in misfeasance: the potential for a greater quan- \ntum of damages. \nVII. CONCLUSION \nThe House of Lords judgment in Three Rivers is an important one for the \ndomestic law of governmental liability. It is illustrative of a gradual liberalis- \ning of the conditions for state liability that has been a feature of recent cases \non the tort of negligence.118 \nWe have seen that liability for financial market supervisors is under discus- \nsion in several EU member states, and there are recent developments in the \ncase law and legislation of a number of member states including France, \nGermany, and Italy. The House of Lords made no reference to any of this.119 \nNeither did it make any reference, in the discussion of the system of the rele- \n112 Rookes v Barnard [1964] AC 1129. \n113 Ibid. \n114 See AB v South West Water Services Ltd [1993] QB 507. 115 Ibid. \n116 R v Secretary of State for Transport ex p Factortame (No 5), [1998] EuLR 456 (CA). \n117 Kuddus v Chief Constable of Leicestershire Constabulary [2001] 2 WLR 1789. \n118 See, in particular, Barrett v Enfield LBC [2001] 2 AC 550; Phelps v Hillingdon LBC [2001] \n2 AC 619. \n119 But the House of Lords extensively discussed cases from different Commonwealth jurisdic- \ntions. They are recognised as persuasive authorities. Lord Bingham foresees that judgments from \nother European countries will be dealt with in a similar way, see for instance his highly convinc- \ning and elegant argument in 'A New Common Law for Europe', in BS Markesinis, The Coming \nTogether of the Common Law and the Civil Law. The Clifford Chance Millenium Lectures \n(Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2000), 27, and in Fairchild [2002] UKHL 22, para 32, where, in para \n168, also Lord Rodger comments on the use of comparative law. A predecessor as Senior Law \nLord, Lord Goff of Chieveley introduced a use of comparative legal materials in the House of \nLords which today is more extensive than in any other European court. But not in the present case. \nThere is an extensive and interesting discussion of fault as an ingredient of tort liability for public \nauthorities in different member states by AG Tesauro in Brasserie du P&cheur v Germany [1995] \nECR 1-1029, [1996] QB 404, at para 85-90. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 06:41:47 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nMisfeasance in Public Office 779 \nvant directive, to the systems of banking supervision in other member states, \nwith one exception.120 \nIt is unfortunate that account was not taken of the European developments. \nThe cases from other national European jurisdictions indicate a perceptible \nshift towards a more liberal approach to actions brought by investors. The \nFrench courts have recognised liability of the regulator, the Commission \nbancaire, whilst still maintaining a strong protection at the fault level. The \nItalian courts have extended their case law in favour of governmental liability \nfor inadequate supervision in the sphere of financial supervision. The German \ndoctrinal critique of the 1984 legislation, limiting the case law in favour of \ndepositors, has become increasingly vocal. \nThe comparative law material could serve a number of purposes. This \nbackdrop of European cases may perhaps assist in the comprehension of the \ndeveloping English case law. The developments in the House of Lords are not \ntaking place in isolation: they are occurring within a broader European trend \nof expanding public law and tort law remedies. \nThe comparative law dimension is not only helpful in allowing one to place \nthe English developments in a wider context. It may also provide practical \nguidance for the domestic courts. In particular, the French litigation allows \none to challenge the assumption that changes at the fault level may result in \nuncontrollable extension of liability in general. The approach of the French \nadministrative courts illustrates a creative attitude to the control mechanisms \nin these cases. In particular, the doctrine of loss of a chance may well be a \nuseful tool for the English courts in evaluating the quantum of loss suffered by \ndepositors. Although the courts have been reluctant to apply this doctrine in \npersonal injury cases for lost chances of recovery,121 there have been a number \nof successful damages actions for the lost opportunity of financial gain,122 in \nspheres a diverse as lost employment opportunities,123 and loss of opportunity \nto bring civil proceedings.124 Comparative material could serve other \npurposes. It could provide a better understanding of the supervisory regime \nunder the two banking directives in force at the relevant time. This is of course \ncrucial for the determination of liability under Community law. \n120 This one exception is the statement about there being no supervisory authorities in the UK \nor Denmark before the First Banking Directive [2000] WLR 1220 at 1254. It is based on a factual \nmisunderstanding. 121 Hotson v East Berkshire Area Health Authority [1987] AC 750. \n122 Allied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons & Simmons [1995] 1 WLR 1602.
