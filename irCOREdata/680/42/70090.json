A monoclonal antibody was raised against a unique keratan sulfate (KS) determinant and used to differentially screen benign and malignant thyroid tissue for the expression of components carrying these moieties. In a total of 349 cases of benign and malignant thyroid lesions, 100% of the 115 PTC cases examined (including various histological subtypes) were found to contain KS-bearing molecules, whereas these were virtually absent from benign tissues and other thyroid tumors, with the exception of 21% of the follicular carcinoma cases analyzed. A composite immunoaffinity chromatography, immunochemistry, and mass spectrometric approach revealed that the PTC-specific KS-bearing macromolecules were unique glycoforms of thyroglobulin and transferrin. Combined, reciprocal immunoprecipitation and Western blotting further indicated that the former glycoform predominated and that most of the transferrin produced by PTC was glycanated with KS moieties.

(Am J Pathol\n2003, 163:183\u2013196)\nPapillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is by far the most fre-\nquent malignant tumor of the thyroid with a threefold\nprevalence in females.1 Early diagnosis is pivotal be-\ncause this tumor can effectively be treated with surgery\nassuring in most cases a disease-free survival.2 Although\na combination of clinical evaluation, ultrasonography,\nand scintigraphy may be suggestive of malignancy, cy-\ntological presurgery (by fine-needle aspiration) and his-\ntological postsurgery examinations remain the most reli-\nable diagnostic tools.2 However, in some circumstances,\na distinction between benign and malignant lesions,\nbased solely on morphological features, is ambiguous\nSupported by the Italian Ministry of Health (Fondo Sanitario Nazionale\nRF99 and RF00), the Associazione Italiana Ricerca sul Cancro, and\nintramural funds from the University of Parma.\nG.

Therefore, despite\nthe relatively facile clinical management of this tumor\nentity, there has been a considerable interest in search-\ning for more reliable genetic and molecular markers. The\nadvent of powerful genetic and molecular methods, such\nas those based on global gene screens through differ-\nential display, SAGE, and cDNA microarray have recently\nidentified a number of putative genetic signatures and\nsingle markers of certain relevance.3\u20136\nApart from these recent genetic\/molecular ap-\nproaches, studies of the past 2 decades have lead to the\nidentification of at least 50 putative PTC markers, which\ninclude genetic anomalies such as loss of heterozygosity\nand microsatellite instability, and posttranslational aber-\nrations such as perturbed glycosylation of certain epithe-\nlial components. Previous studies on thyroid neoplasms\nhave identified one of these latter types of PTC-associ-\nated abnormalities, which consists in the formation of\npoly-N-acetyllactosamines glycans carrying 6-O-sulfa-\ntions on certain of their galactose or N-acetylglucosamine\nunits and sialic and\/or fucosyl groups at their nonreduc-\ning terminal ends.7,8 However, the precise composition of\nthese glycan moieties, the nature of their backbone pro-\nteins and the clinical implication of these transformation-\ndependent, posttranslational modifications have not\nbeen clarified.\nWe have produced a monoclonal antibody denoted\n373E1 and directed against a unique sialylation\/confor-\nmational-dependent KS epitope that detects a novel gly-\ncoprotein complex produced almost exclusively by PTC\ncells. In this study, combined immunochemical, pro-\nteomic, and postproteomic techniques were therefore\nused to unravel the identity of the constituents of this KS\ncomplex, as well as to define the fine structure of the KS\nmoieties bound to these components in PTC.\nMaterials and Methods\nProduction and Characterization of Antibody\n373E1\nMonoclonal antibody (mAb) 373E1 was produced ac-\ncording to standard protocols by immunization of BALB\/c\nfemale mice with a preparation of embryonic chick pro-\nteoglycans (PGs) extracted with 4 mol\/L of GuHCl in the\npresence of protease inhibitors and purified by sequen-\ntial ion-exchange and gel permeation chromatography\naccording to a procedure described elsewhere.9 Initial\nselection of hybridoma clones was performed by conven-\ntional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) us-\ning the immunogen and analogous PG preparations from\nadult chick gizzard. Selected clones were then tested for\ntheir ability to recognize a number of KS-bearing carti-\nlage PGs (see below), such as to ascertain their reactivity\nagainst this type of glycan structure. Of \u000135 clones orig-\ninally identified, 3 showed a high and specific reactivity\nagainst all of the above types of PGs and one denoted\n373E1 was chosen for further subcloning and character-\nization. The antibody was determined to be of IgM class\nand was used, depending on the type of immunochemi-\ncal assay to be performed, in the form of hybridoma\nculture supernatant, purified immunoglobulins obtained\nafter caprylic acid-precipitation, or ascites fluid produced\nin nude mice according to standard protocols. Charac-\nteristics of mAb 373E1 were determined by direct and\ncompetitive ELISA and Western blotting, using a series of\nKS-bearing and KS-free PGs and mucins as screening\nantigens. These reactivities were additionally compared\nto those of previously described anti-KS mAbs, such as\n1B4 (mouse IgG), 3D2 (mouse IgM), 4D1 (mouse IgM),\nand 2D3 (mouse IgM; obtained from Michael Sorrell,\nDepartment of Cell and Developmental Biology, Case\nWestern University, Cleveland, OH), 5D4 (mouse IgG;\nICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA), as well as\nvarious plant lectins. PGs carrying KS chains and used\nfor antibody characterization included bovine nasal car-\ntilage aggrecan, human articular cartilage aggrecan,\nchick embryonic cartilage aggrecan, and bovine and\nhuman tendon fibromodulin provided by Dick Heineg\u00e5rd\n(Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of\nLund, Lund, Sweden). PGs lacking KS chains and used\nas controls included the rat chondrosarcoma aggrecan\n(ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.), mouse EHS perlecan, and\nbovine tendon decorin and biglycan. MUC2 from porcine\nintestine and a mixture of MUC5AC, MUC5B, and MUC7\nfrom bovine submaxillary glands were obtained from\nSigma and used as negative controls. PGs and mucins\nwere immobilized onto 96-microwell plates (Greiner\nLabortechnik, Germany) by coating with 0.5 to 1 \u0001g\/well\nof the molecules overnight at 4\u00b0C in 0.05 mol\/L of bicar-\nbonate buffer, pH 9.6. In some cases, immobilized PGs\nwere chemically desulfated by treatment with 50 mmol\/L\nof HCl in 100% methanol for 4 hours at room temperature\nbefore being incubated with the 373E1 antibody. Coat-\nings with the PGs and mucins was routinely followed by\nblocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-\nbuffered saline (PBS) for 1 hour at room temperature,\nextensive washings, and in some cases digested with the\nvarious deglycosylating enzymes described below in\ntheir appropriate buffers for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. Digested and\nnondigested model antigens were then incubated for 1\nhour at room temperature with various concentrations of\nthe 373E1 antibody (ie, 1:10 to 1:100,000, depending on\nthe form in which the antibody was used). In a number of\nexperiments, incubation with 373E1 antibody was per-\nformed in the presence of a number of molecules to be\ntested as putative competitors for epitope binding. These\nwere used either in the intact or enzyme digested form. In\nall cases, excess unbound antibody was washed away\nand detection of the bound antibody was accomplished\nby a further 1-hour incubation of the plates with horse-\nradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse second-\nary antibodies (Zymed Immunochemicals, San Fran-\ncisco, CA) diluted 1:1000 in PBS with 1% bovine serum\nalbumin followed by incubation with 2,2\u0002-azino-di[3-ethyl-\nbenzthiazolinsulfonate].\nPatients and Tissue Samples\nTissue samples were collected from patients that under-\nwent surgical removal of one or both thyroid lobes during\n184 Magro et al\nAJP July 2003, Vol. 163, No. 1\nthe years 1989 to 2001 and were classified according to\nthe recently recommended reporting format for thyroid\ncarcinomas.10 Thyroid tumors and nonneoplastic lesions\n(a total 349 specimens) were diagnosed at either the\nSection of Anatomical Pathology, University of Catania, or\nat the analogous Section at the Institute \u201cCasa Sollievo\ndella Sofferenza\u201d of San Giovanni Rotondo. Neoplastic\nspecimens included 60 follicular adenomas, of which 14\nwere predominantly composed of Hurthle cells; 115 PTCs\n(91 females and 24 males in ages from 22 to 83 years),\nincluding 78 of the classical type, 10 follicular variants, 7\ncases of the encapsulated variant, 15 cases of microcar-\ncinomas, ie, presenting a lesion size \u00031.0 cm in width, 2\ncases of the Hurthle cell variant, 2 cases of the macro-\nfollicular variant, and 1 case of a Warthin\u2019s tumor-like\nvariant; 52 follicular carcinomas, including 29 of the\nwidely invasive and 23 cases of the minimally invasive\ntype of which 5 cases of the former and 4 of the latter type\nwere Hurthle cell variants; 10 medullary carcinomas and\n5 anaplastic carcinomas. Local lymphonodal metastases\nwere found in 18 patients affected by PTC. Nonneoplastic\nlesions included 48 nodular goiters, 20 Grave\u2019s disease\ncases, and 11 cases of Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis. Focal to\nmore widespread papillary hyperplasia was found in 19\nnodular goiters, 7 Grave\u2019s disease cases, and 12 of the\nfollicular adenoma patients. Control tissues considered\nas healthy were represented by the morphologically nor-\nmal areas surrounding the PTC lesions and by five addi-\ntional histologically normal thyroids from patients that had\nundergone total thyroidectomy after diagnosis of PTC in\nthe contralateral lobe.\nImmunohistochemical Staining\nTissue samples to be processed for indirect immunohis-\ntochemistry were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and rou-\ntinely embedded in paraffin or OCT medium for cryosec-\ntioning. Cryosectioned specimens included 10 PTC\nlesions, 10 nodular goiters, 5 follicular adenomas, and 3\nwidely invasive follicular carcinomas. Before incubation\nwith primary antibodies, cryosections were air-dried for\n20 minutes, fixed in cold acetone for 10 minutes at room\ntemperature, further air-dried for 10 minutes, and then\nincubated with primary and secondary antibodies. Indi-\nrect immunohistochemical stainings were performed by\nthe standard streptavidin-biotin-labeling technique using\nthe LSAB kit (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Sections de-\nrived from paraffin-embedded specimens were deparaf-\nfinized in xylene for 15 minutes, rehydrated, and treated\nwith 3% H2O2 for 10 minutes to block endogenous per-\noxidase activity, followed by extensive rinsing in double-\ndistilled water and further rinsing for 15 minutes in 0.01\nmol\/L of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. Depar-\naffinized sections were incubated with either of the pri-\nmary antibodies, 373E1 (Biogenex, San Ramon, CA),\nanti-transferrin (clone HT1\u201313.6.3; ICN Biochemicals,\nInc.), and anti-HBME-1 (Dakopatts Carpinteria, CA), or\ncontrol antibodies 7D1 and 2C12 (mouse IgM) directed\nagainst human articular cartilage aggrecan and vascular\nPG-M\/versicans, at 4\u00b0C overnight. This was followed by\nincubation with biotinylated anti-mouse IgM or IgG sec-\nondary antibodies for 15 minutes and peroxidase-conju-\ngated streptavidin for 15 minutes at room temperature. In\nseveral cases of immunolabeling with antibody 373E1\nand in all cases of stainings with the anti-transferrin anti-\nbody, sections were pretreated with citrate buffer (pH\n6.0) and exposed to radiation in a microwave oven. Su-\nperior antigen retrieval was observed for anti-transferrin\nantibodies, but not for the antigens recognized by anti-\nbody 373E1. Similarly, pretreatments of the sections with\n0.1% trypsin in PBS did not alter the staining pattern\nobserved with antibody 373E1. To reduce the commonly\nseen nonspecific immunoreactivity in Hurthle cells, which\nare frequently present in both benign and malignant thy-\nroid tissues, tissue sections were pretreated with 10\nmg\/ml of ovalbumin in PBS followed by 0.2% biotin in\nPBS, each for 15 minutes at room temperature. Bound\nantibody was revealed by incubation with 3,3\u0002-diamino-\nbenzidine (Sigma Chemical Co.) in 0.01% H2O2 for 5\nminutes at room temperature. Sections were then coun-\nterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted.\nThe percentage of positively stained cells was assessed\nsemiquantitatively according to a four-tiered-system\n(\u00031% positive cells, negative staining; 1 to 10% positive\ncells, focal staining; 11 to 50% positive cells, heteroge-\nneous staining; \u000450%, widespread staining).

The extracted material was\ncentrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C and the\nsupernatant collected and either extensively dialyzed\nagainst immunoprecipitation buffer (see below) or further\nseparated by high performance liquid chromatography.\nIn this case, the material was loaded onto an ion-ex-\nchange Mono-Q column, which was equilibrated and\neluted at a flow rate of 0.3 ml\/min with a linear 0 to 0.5\nmol\/L gradient of LiCl4 in 10 mmol\/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,\ncontaining 5 mmol\/L of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid\nand 0.5% Brij 35. Chromatographic runs were monitored\nby adsorbance at 260 and 232 nm and the collected\nfractions were analyzed by ELISA using antibody 373E1\nor dot-blotting using Alcian blue staining.10,11 Positive\nfractions were pooled and either processed for immuno-\nprecipitation or directly resolved by sodium dodecyl sul-\nfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and\nWestern blotted.\nImmunoprecipitation\nBenign and malignant tissue extracts corresponding to 1\nto 3 mg of total protein, or pooled high performance liquid\nchromatography fractions, were solubilized\/dialyzed\nagainst immunoprecipitation buffer composed of PBS\nwith 1% (v\/v) Igepal CA 630 (Sigma), 0.1% (w\/v) SDS, 5\nmmol\/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 5 mmol\/L N-eth-\nylmaleimide, and 2 mmol\/L phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride\nand incubated 2 hours at 4\u00b0C with 2 \u0001l of normal mouse\nserum and 100 \u0001l of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amer-\nsham-Pharmacia Biotech), which had previously been\ndiluted 1:1 in immunoprecipitation buffer.

The wash solution was removed and the\ndried gel pieces were rehydrated with 100 mmol\/L of\nTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, incubated in the same buffer\ncontaining 1 mmol\/L CaCl2, 10% acetonitrile, and 0.2 to\n0.5 \u0001g trypsin, and finally incubated for 15 hours at 36\u00b0C\nto obtain in-gel digestion of the polypeptides. Thereafter,\nslices were incubated with an excess of 2% aqueous\ntrifluoracetic acid (TFA) at 60\u00b0C for 1 hour under shaking\nand further processed by tandem nanospray ESI-Q\/TOF\nMS\/MS fragmentation analysis according to a previously\ndetailed protocol.17\u201319 For this purpose, the peptide mix-\ntures obtained after enzyme treatment were lyophilized\nand resuspended in 5 \u0001l of a solution containing metha-\nnol\/water\/formic acid at a 50:49:1 ratio (v\/v\/v) and intro-\nduced into nanoelectrospray needles that were pulled\nand operated as previously described.16\u201318 Tandem\nmass spectra of the peptides was obtained with \u000450\nppm mass accuracy. MS\/MS measurements performed\nusing the Q-TOF apparatus (Micromass, Manchester,\nUK) on 39 of a total of 65 peptides examined by mass\nspectrometry yielded the relative masses and charges of\nthe peptides for which the amino acid sequence was\nderived using a specifically dedicated sequence tag soft-\nware based on AppleScript (Apple, Cupertino, CA) and\nBioMultiView (Sciex, Toronto, Canada). For database\nidentification, the mass fragments with highest m\/z in the\nY ion series in the MS\/MS spectra of tryptic peptides were\njoined into a short sequence stretch. When combined\nwith the molecular mass information, this stretch was\nassembled into approximately three-amino acid se-\nquence tags, with the residual mass N-terminal and C-\nterminal of the interpreted region and the peptide mass,\nand searched in a nonredundant protein sequence da-\ntabase containing\u0004230,000 entries using PeptideSearch\nversion 2.9 (available via www.mann.embl-heidelberg.de)\nas previously described.20,21\nDetermination of KS Structure\nStructural traits of the KS chains contained by the 373E1\nimmunocomplex were analyzed by a recently devised\nfluorescent keratanase II-based22,23 fingerprinting meth-\nod,24 providing a valid alternative to the high-field 1H- and\n13C-NMR spectroscopical techniques.22,23,25,26 The KS-\nbearing antigen complex was eluted from 373E1-coated\naffinity beads by the addition of 0.5 ml of 4 mol\/L guanidine\nhydrochloride\/50 mmol\/L Tris-HCl\/0.1% CHAPS, pH 6.8.\nThe sample was then diluted by the addition of 1.5 ml of\n5 mmol\/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then loaded onto a col-\numn of Source 15Q (10 \u0006 1 cm) equilibrated in 5 mmol\/L\nTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted with a linear gradient of 5\nmmol\/L Tris-HCl2 mol\/L NaCl, pH 8.0, from 15 to 45\nminutes. 373E1-positive fractions detected by ELISA\nwere pooled and lyophilized before desalting of the\nsample on a column of Bio-Gel P2. A sample of the\nKS-bearing complex was re-dissolved in 200 \u0001l double-\ndistilled H2O and applied to a Microcon concentrator\n(30,000 Mr cutoff) followed by centrifugation at 10,000 \u0006\ng for 1 hour. The retained material was washed twice with\n100 \u0001l of 10 mmol\/L sodium acetate, pH 6.5, and then\nresuspended in 20 \u0001l of sodium acetate buffer. The sam-\nple was then prepared for keratanase II fingerprinting by\ndigestion with 1.0 mU of keratanase II for 16 hours at\n37\u00b0C followed by lyophilization to remove all traces of\nwater and labeling of the oligosaccharides with the flu-\norophore 2-aminobenzoic acid using the 2-AA labeling kit\nfrom Oxford Glycosciences Ltd. according to the manu-\nfacturer\u2019s instructions. This was done by incubation of the\nKS oligosaccharides with 2 \u0001l of a solution containing\ndimethyl sulfoxide, glacial acetic acid, 2-aminobenzoic\nacid, and sodium cyanoborohydride for 2 hours at 65\u00b0C.\nThe labeled sample was diluted to 50 \u0001l with distilled\nwater and 10 \u0001l applied to a Dionex AS4A-SC column\n(250 \u0006 4 mm) equilibrated with 2 ml\/min 150 mmol\/L\nNaOH and eluted with a linear gradient of 2 ml\/min 0 to\n600 mmol\/L NaCl\/150 mmol\/L NaOH from 5 to 65 min-\nutes. The column was maintained at a constant temper-\nature of 50\u00b0C and the eluate monitored on line using a\nfluorescence detector. The excitation and emission\nwavelengths were 315 nm and 400 nm, respectively.\nResults\nSpecificity of Antibody 373E1\nTo ascertain its KS specificity, antibody 373E1 was ini-\ntially tested in ELISA on a number of model antigens,\nincluding KS-bearing and KS-lacking PGs used as model\nantigens; compositionally well-characterized KSs iso-\nlated from two distinct tissue sources; and mucins carry-\ning abundant poly-O-acetyllactosamine moieties. The an-\ntibody strongly reacted with all KS-containing model\nantigens, but failed to recognize control PGs carrying\nexclusively other types of glycosaminoglycans, including\nthe rat chondrosarcoma aggrecan, perlecan, decorin,\nand biglycan (not shown). Concentration-dependent en-\nzymatic predigestions of the KS-containing antigens with\nThyroglobulin\/Transferrin Glycoforms in PTC 187\nAJP July 2003, Vol. 163, No. 1\nendo-\u0002-galactosidase and keratanase II caused a strong\nto complete elimination of the immunoreactivity, whereas\nkeratanase I digestion was somewhat less efficient (Table\n1). The use of other lyases, such as chondroitinase ABC;\nheparitinase III; endoglycosidases H and F; \u0002-galac-\ntosidase; O-glycosidase; N-acetyl-\u0002-D-glucosaminidase;\n\u0003-1,3\/4-L-fucosidase; N-glycosidases A, F, and N, did not\nsignificantly alter antibody binding, confirming that the\nspecificity of the antibody was against KS.\nSimilarly, in competition ELISA involving various glycos-\naminoglycans, only KSs (from either articular cartilage or\ncornea) effectively competed off antibody binding (Table 1).\nHowever, if these KSs were predigested with KS-degrading\nenzymes, they completely lost their ability to interfere with\nantibody-antigen binding, with the exception of prediges-\ntion with keratanase I, which produced KS disaccharide\nunits retaining competitive activity (ie, preserved the intact\nepitope). This observation and a number of other experi-\nments involving other previously described anti-KS antibod-\nies (of both IgG and IgM immunoglobulin subtype) strongly\nindicated that antibody 373E1 recognized a complex KS\nepitope. Dose-dependent digestion with three of four differ-\nent neuraminidases, significantly incremented the binding\nof 373E1 to human articular cartilage aggrecan, chosen as\na primary model antigen, with the most pronounced effect\nseen with neuraminidase from Newcastle disease virus.\nThis effect was completely inhibited by the neuraminidase-\nspecific inhibitor 2,3-dehydroxy-2-deoxy-N-acetylneura-\nminic acid, whereas various neuraminic lactoses were inef-\nfective as antibody-antigen-binding competitors (Table 1).\nThese findings demonstrated that terminal sialic acid resi-\ndues of KS moieties partly occluded the 373E1 epitope, but\ndid not themselves constitute the antigenic determinant,\nand further highlighted the unique reactivity of the antibody\nagainst defined KS structures.\nSpecific KS-reactivity of the antibody was also as-\nserted by Western blotting involving predigestion of the\nmodel antigens with either endo-\u0002-galactosidase or\nchondroitinase ABC (not shown). In accordance with the\nenzyme digestion results, treatment of the above anti-\nTable 1.

In contrast, irrespectively of histological\nclassification, lesion size, or presence or absence of\nmetastatic formations, all PTC cases (115 of 115) con-\ntained up to 75% of the malignant cells expressing the KS\ncomponents (Table 2; Figure 1, A and C; Figure 2, B and\nD). In these tumors, coincident intracellular, apical cell-\nsurface and extracellular (luminal) staining patterns were\nobserved, indicating the presence of both cell-retained\nand secreted forms of these molecules (Figure 1, A and\nC; Figure 2, B and D). PTC-selectivity of the KS compo-\nnents recognized by antibody 373E1 was further demon-\nstrated by several criteria: 1) positive staining of individ-\nual neoplastic follicles that intermingled with healthy\nfollicles in the periphery of the main tumor lesion; 2)\npositive immunolabeling of single neoplastic cells or clus-\nters of cells embedded in a fibrosclerotic tumor stroma;\n3) positive staining of cells invading the fibrous tumor\ncapsule (encapsulated variant of PTC); and 4) positive\nstaining of cells that had invaded lymphatic and\/or ve-\nnous vessels (Figure 1E). This latter observation also\nimplied that all lymphnodal PTC metastases (ie, 18 of 18)\nanalyzed showed positive immunoreactivity (Table 2; Fig-\nure 1F). Among the other malignant thyroid tumors ana-\nlyzed, only 21% of follicular carcinomas (both of the\nwidely invasive and minimally invasive types) contained\nscattered positively stained cells (Table 2; Figure 2C).\nConversely, no immunoreactivity was seen in any of the\ncells of anaplastic and medullary carcinomas (Table 2).\nPretreatment of sections from PTC lesions with either\nendo-\u0002-galactosidase or keratanase II markedly reduced\nor completely abrogated 373E1 immunoreactivity, with\nthe former enzyme being generally more effective in re-\nducing staining intensity and distribution (Figure 1H). In\ncontrast, digestion with chondroitinase ABC, keratanase\nI, or fucosidase did not alter the staining pattern (not\nshown). Consistently with the determined specificity of\nantibody 373E1 reported here and elsewhere (Perissi-\nnotto et al, in preparation), predigestion of sections with\nneuraminidase slightly augmented the relative intensity of\nstaining without, however, perturbing the overall distribu-\ntion of the staining (not shown). When performed on\nbenign lesions, these enzymatic treatments did not unveil\n373E1 immunoreactivities and, similarly, equivalent stain-\ning patterns were observed in routine formalin-fixed and\nparaffin-embedded material and cryosectioned speci-\nmens indicating that the lack of the positive reaction in\nthese tissues was not because of masking effects.\nBecause a number of previous and more recent re-\nports have documented a certain value of antibody\nHBME-1 in discriminating malignant thyroid tissues,27\u201330\nbut the antigen recognized by this antibody remains un-\nknown, we have compared its reactivity pattern with that\nobserved with our 373E1 antibody. For this purpose,\nconsecutive serial sections from 10 randomly chosen\nPTC cases (eight of the classical type and two of the\nfollicular variant) were stained in a parallel or competitive\nmanner (ie, using biotinylated mAb 373E1 detected with\nstreptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and untagged\nHBME-1 detected with a secondary antibody). No com-\npetition was observed (not shown) and, although immu-\nnolabeling with mAb HBME-1 was as diffuse as that of\nmAb 373E1 in neoplastic PTC cells, the cellular localiza-\ntion of the immunostaining was clearly different: antibody\nHBME-1 stained exclusively the cell surface (Figure 2, A\nand B).\nTable 2.

Therefore, the immunoaffinity-\npurified PTC material was analyzed by nanospray ESI-Q\/\nTOF in co-axial MS\/MS mode. Of a total of 65 tryptic\npeptides that were examined, the primary 23 from which\nsequence was successfully determined were found to\ncorrespond to thyroglobulin and transferrin, indicating\nthat these glycoproteins were the prevailing proteins car-\nrying KS moieties (Figure 3). The analysis was performed\nby dividing the SDS-PAGE preparative separation of the\n373E1-immunoprecipitated PTC material into 10 arbitrary\nchosen zones and electroeluting each individual zone for\ntryptic peptide generation. No reliable sequences were\nobtained from peptides derived from zones 7 and 8,\nwhereas the transferrin sequence was found at the bor-\nder of zones 9 and 10 (Figure 3). An additional transferrin\npeptide of Mr 1423 d was also found in zone 5 (probably\nderiving from transferrin multimers), but the precise se-\nquence of this peptide was not further defined. Three\npeptides having the respective Mr of 1468, 1290, and\n1061 d and the putative amino acid sequences (I)T-\nFD(I)SSNIGSA(SR), VTEF(I\/L)E(VNPN)K, and T(I\/L)(I\/L)D-\nSN(Q\/K)NR (identity of amino acids within parentheses\nwere not fully asserted) were identified in the material\nderived from zone 4. The first one shows 34% homology\nwith CFTCR, whereas the others do not match with cur-\nrently known proteins. These peptides and their deriva-\ntion were not further investigated here.\nThe relative electrophoretic mobility of the PTC-spe-\ncific KS-substituted transferrin highlighted an apparently\nsignificantly larger Mr for this glycoform, when compared\nto previously described serum transferrins (Figure 3).\nThis discrepancy was likely to have been entirely ac-\ncounted by the KS moieties of this specific glycoform.\nThe KS-bearing thyroglobulin isoform found in PTC also\nappeared larger in size (ie, \u0004900 kd), when compared to\nboth the heterologous one detected in nodular goiters\nand the 670-kd bovine homologue used as molecular\nweight reference. The KS glycanation variant of this pro-\ntein also seemed to be diversely susceptible to proteo-\nlytic processing in situ in the malignant, but not in the\nFigure 2.

This observation suggested\nthat KS substitution of the backbone incremented the\nproteolysis susceptibility of this glycoprotein.\nThe immunohistochemical data indicated to us that, as\nmay have been expected, thyroglobulin was substantially\nmore expressed than transferrin (see below) in PTC le-\nsions. To attempt an assessment of the relative ratio of\nthe KS-substituted glycoforms of thyroglobulin and trans-\nferrin, we undertook a comparative densitometric analy-\nsis of bands visualized in the zones corresponding to\nthyroglobulin and transferrin (Figure 3), after analytical\nseparation by SDS-PAGE and staining with the com-\nbined silver-Alcian blue procedure, and by performing\nreciprocal immunoprecipitations and Western blottings\nwith the antibody 373E1 and antibodies to thyroglobu-\nlin and transferrin. For the first type of analysis, we\nmade two assumptions: that the silver-Alcian blue\nstaining method labeled the two glycoforms in a com-\nparable manner and that the thyroglobulin bands be-\nlow 700 kd all represented naturally occurring degra-\ndation products of the original 800- to 900-kd\nmacromolecule. Density measurements of zones 1 to\n3, containing intact KS-thyroglobulin, versus zone 9,\nencompassing the KS-bearing transferrin in optimally\nstained gels indicated that the ratio between the two\nmolecules was 11.8:1. On the other hand, if lower\nbands identified as pertaining to KS-thyroglobulin were\nconsidered, the difference was \u000120-fold in favor of\nKS-thyroglobulin.\nIn another set of experiments, PTC extracts were\neither immunoprecipitated with 373E1, anti-thyroglob-\nulin, or anti-transferrin antibodies resolved by SDS-\nPAGE under nonreducing conditions and then blotted\nwith the heterologous antibodies or depleted of 373E1-\nreactive material, and similarly resolved by SDS-PAGE\nunder nonreducing conditions and immunoblotted with\nantibodies to either thyroglobulin or transferrin (Figure\n4). These experiments highlighted KS chains attached\nto PTC thyroglobulin accounted for the size polydisper-\nsity of this glycoform, whereas the relatively homoge-\nnous bands of PTC transferrin (Figure 4) suggested\nthat it contained less prominent KS chains (presumably\nboth in length and size). Furthermore, most, if not all, of\nthe transferrin produced by PTC seemed to glycanate\nwith KS, whereas the tumor synthesized some KS-free\nthyroglobulin (Figure 4). The relative enrichment of\nFigure 3. Proteomic and immunochemical analysis of the KS-bearing PTC antigen complex. For Q-TOF-MS\/MS involving nanoelectrospraying and isotopic end\nlabeling of the tryptic peptides (right), these were derived from preparative SDS-PAGE silver-stained gels in which the lane was subdivided into 10 arbitrarily\nselected zones (eluted zones; see Materials and Methods). Size (fragment size) and primary structure (sequence) data are reported from the 23 major peptides\nidentified. The position column indicates the relative position of the determined amino acid residues in the corresponding identified (identity) polypeptides.\nPeptides derived from zone 10 also encompassed residual portions of the 373E1 IgM used for the immunoaffinity purification of the complex. Immunoblotting\n(left) of both benign nodular goiters (NG) and PTC was performed on surgical specimens treated as for proteomic analyses, electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose\nmembranes, and detected with anti-thyroglobulin and anti-transferrin antibodies. Both naturally occurring degradations and putative multimeric formations (the\nlatter only in PTC) were observed for transferrin, whereas an extensive electrophoretic mobility difference and proteolysis susceptibility was seen for\nKS-thyroglobulin in PTC, but not benign tissues.\n192 Magro et al\nAJP July 2003, Vol. 163, No. 1\nboth KS-bearing and KS-free thyroglobulin and trans-\nferrin through the use of the specific antibodies also\nsupported the substantially higher levels of (KS)-\nthyroglobulin in PTC. Finally, in several occasions, an\nunidentified 220- to 240-kd band recognized by anti-\ntransferrin antibodies could be specifically detected in\nPTC extracts. It is presently unclear whether it repre-\nsents oligomeric forms of the protein or an alternative\ntransferrin-like glycoprotein.\nDifferential Overexpression of Transferrin in PTC\nLesions\nThe identification of transferrin as one of the KS gly-\ncanated components specifically produced by PTC was\nunexpected and prompted us to examine whether this\nglycoprotein was also differentially expressed in this tu-\nmor versus benign thyroid lesions. Indeed, immunostain-\ning of tissue section with anti-transferrin antibodies re-\nvealed that the molecule was overexpressed in PTC, with\na preponderant (78%) frequency of expression in the\ncases analyzed (Figure 1G) and a mere 11 to 18% fre-\nquency in benign tissues (Table 1). This observation\nindicated that the transferrin gene product was generally\novertranscribed in PTC and was consistent with the out-\ncome of the combined immunoprecipitation\/immunoblot-\nting experiments.\nComposition of the KS Moieties Linked to the\nPTC Thyroglobulin and Transferrin Isoforms\nKS was found to be the prevalent glycosaminoglycan\nassociated with the thyroglobulin and transferrin pro-\nduced by PTC, as shown by dot-blotting with 11 different\nplant lectins (not shown) and Western blotting (Figure\n5A), involving differential enzyme digestions with a num-\nber of endo- and exoglycosydases. These experiments\nalso showed that the specific KS glycans were only partly\ndegraded by keratanase I (Figure 5A) and, accordingly,\nwere likely to embody a certain amount of \u0003(1-3)-linked\nfucose residues. Furthermore, in accordance with the\napparent specificity of antibody 373E1, which seems to\nFigure 4.

Analysis of the areas under each oligosaccharide peak\nwas used to calculate the average chain length.\nThyroglobulin\/Transferrin Glycoforms in PTC 193\nAJP July 2003, Vol. 163, No. 1\nreact with a KS epitope located adjacently to N-acetyl-\nneuraminic acid residues, neuraminidase digestion sig-\nnificantly augmented the reactivity levels and coinciden-\ntally altered the mobility pattern of the macromolecules\n(Figure 5A). Even in this case, neuraminidase from New-\ncastle disease virus was by far the most efficient in pro-\nducing this effect, which was entirely abrogated in the\npresence of 5 mmol\/L of the neuraminidase-specific in-\nhibitor 2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid\n(not shown). Similar results were also obtained in ELISA\nand dot-blot assays in which, before antibody binding,\nthe immunoprecipitates were treated with increasing con-\ncentrations of various neuraminidases. These findings\nindicated that the KS moieties of these thyroglobulin and\ntransferrin isoforms were heterogeneously and highly sia-\nlylated in a prevalent \u0003(2-3), and possibly \u0003(2-8), linkage.\nKS chains bound to the PTC-specific thyroglobulin and\ntransferrin glycoforms were not released from the protein\ncore by alkali treatment (50 mmol\/L NaOH at 45\u00b0C for 24\nhours) suggesting that they are not O-linked through\nN-acetylgalactosamine to serine or threonine as in type II\nKS.33 In contrast, a proportion of the chains was released\nby treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F indicating that\ncertain chains were attached through a KS type I-char-\nacteristic N-linkage via N-acetylglucosamine to aspara-\ngine residues. Analysis of the keratanase II-generated\nprofiles of the purified KS chains (Figure 5B) demon-\nstrated a marked preponderance of the disulfated disac-\ncharide unit [R3], Gal(6S)\u0002(1-4)GlcNAc(6S), which\neluted at 19.2 minutes. In contrast, there was no evidence\nfor the presence of significant amounts of the monosul-\nfated disaccharide species, Gal\u0002(1-4)GlcNAc(6S), which\nwould have eluted at \u00017 minutes. This finding further\nindicates that the PTC thyroglobulin\/transferrin KS chains\nwere almost fully sulfated on their galactose residues.\nHowever, the small peak detected at 14.4 minutes was\nidentifiable as the disulfated tetrasaccharide [R2],\nGal\u0002(1-4)GlcNAc(6S)\u0002(1-3)Gal\u0002(1-4)GlcNAc(6S), show-\ning that they also contained some unsulfated galactose\nresidues.\nThe second most abundant oligosaccharide peak in the\nKS profile eluted at 21.6 minutes, which is compatible with\nthe nonreducing terminal trisaccharide unit NeuAc\u0003(2-\n3)Gal(6S)\u0002(1-4)GlcNAc(6S). This assignment was corrobo-\nrated by treatment of the digested sample with neuramini-\ndase, which caused disappearance of this peak and a\nconcomitant increase in the disulfated disaccharide peak,\n[R2]. A further oligosaccharide moiety derived from the\nnonreducing terminus of the KS glycans and correspond-\ning to [C5], NeuAc\u0003(2-3)Gal(6S)\u0002(1-4)GlcNAc(6S)\u0002(1-\n3)Gal\u0002(1-4)GlcNAc(6S), was weakly noticeable in the\npeak eluting at 45.0 minutes. This observation, and\nthe detected binding of the Sambucus nigra agglutinin to\nthe complex (not shown), collectively supported the idea\nthat the majority, if not all, of the KS chains terminated\nwith a \u0003(2-3)-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid-capping\nresidue. Thus, this finding was in perfect accord with the\nantibody specificity data and the observations on the\ntumor tissues in situ. However, a small sialidase resistant\npeak was observed at 23.7 minutes and found to not be\ncompatible with any of the previously identified KS oligo-\nsaccharides. The paucity of material contained in this\npeak did not allow the determination as to whether it\nrepresents a genuine oligosaccharide or a contaminant\nbut, if real, it may correspond to an additional nonre-\nducing terminal structure. The elution position of this\npeak suggests that it may be a trisulfated trisaccharide\nand it could possibly be one having the compo-\nsition of GalNAc(6S)\u0002(1-3)Gal(6S)\u0002(1-4)GlcNAc(6S) or\nGlcNAc(6S)\u0002(1-3)Gal(6S)\u0002(1-4)GlcNAc(6S), which have\npreviously been identified as nonreducing termini in cor-\nneal (but not skeletal) KSs.34,35 Unfortunately, because\nthe profiling method use here is incapable of resolving\nthese two oligosaccharides and alternative more com-\nplex and laborious methods, as well as large amounts of\nmaterial would be required, the precise composition can\nrequire a larger quantity of sample that was unavailable in\nthis study.\nThe precise composition of this structure was not fur-\nther investigated here, but it would represent the first\ntumor-specific KS structure to be ever identified. Finally,\nif we disregard from this novel structure and assume that\nall KS units produced by PTC were fully capped by\n\u0003(2-3)-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid residues, then an\napproximate size for the PTC-specific thyroglobulin- and\ntransferrin-associated KS glycans can be approximated\nto 9 to 10 disaccharides in length, which would translate\ninto an average Mr for the KS chains of 7600 d (consid-\nering that a classical KS linkage region would have a Mr\nof 1900 d). This size estimation is in accordance with the\none that we independently established by gel-perme-\nation chromatography on a Bio-Gel TSK-30 column cali-\nbrated with KS chains of 6900 d (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nIt is well known that on malignant transformation, epithe-\nlial cells modulate the glycosylation profile of their secre-\ntion products and that these posttranslational changes\nmay represent exploitable diagnostic\/prognostic mark-\ners, as well as important tools for the elucidation of the\nmolecular mechanisms responsible for the progression of\nthese tumors. Bearing this in mind, we have used a\nunique anti-KS antibody to address the possibility, previ-\nously alluded to,7 that the elaboration of KS chains could\nrepresent a specific trait of PTC. Indeed, we found that\nexpression of KS-bearing molecules occurred in 100% of\nthe PTC cases investigated, with a widespread cellular\ndistribution in the majority of the lesions analyzed. In\ncontrast, molecules with a similar glycanation pattern\nwere absent from benign tissues and other thyroid tumor\ntypes, with the exception of a rather limited expression in\nfollicular carcinomas. Parallel immunohistochemical\nstainings also demonstrated that the KS components\nidentified in situ by antibody 373E1 were associated with\nboth the metastatic and nonmetastatic PTC cells, as well\nas occurring in the form of a secreted product(s) of\ntumor. This apparent specificity of the KS-carrying mole-\ncules for malignant PTC cells incited us to devise suitable\nprotocols for the isolation and structural characterization\n194 Magro et al\nAJP July 2003, Vol. 163, No. 1\nof the components, such as to set the basis for their full\nclinical exploitation.\nBy combining biochemical, immunochemical, and\nchromatographic purification schemes we were able to\nenrich for the KS-containing complex and, to overcome\nthe technical obstacle given by its high glycan content,\nwe adopted an ESI-Q-TOF MS\/MS procedure involving\nanalysis of tryptic peptides derived from the immunoaf-\nfinity-purified components. Sequence determination\nachieved by this method identified thyroglobulin and\ntransferrin as the prevalent glycoproteins carrying the\nPTC-produced KS moieties. These data further showed\nthat the former glycoprotein, by virtue of its unusual gly-\ncosylation, had a significantly incremented Mr and exhib-\nited a diverse in vivo proteolysis pattern, when compared\nto thyroglobulin from normal thyroid. In fact, our prelimi-\nnary evidence is that the KS substitution of PTC thyro-\nglobulin markedly protects the molecule from cleavage\nby cathepsin-K, clostripain, thermolysin, and thrombin,\nreduces its susceptibility to plasmin, whereas it has no\neffect on degradation of the glycoform by V8 protease,\nsubtilisin, bacterial elastase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin\n(data not shown). Notable was also that some of the\nnaturally occurring proteolytic fragments of the KS-bear-\ning thyroglobulin isoform identified here shared some\nsize similarities with previously described PTC-specific\noncofetal fibronectin fragments recognized by antibody\nJT-95 and found circulating in the peripheral blood of\nPTC patients.36 However, we do not find any evidence\nthat this PTC fibronectin would carry KS moieties.\nKS-containing thyroglobulin seemed to prevail over\nKS-lacking thyroglobulin in PTC and KS-bearing trans-\nferrin seemed to be rather exclusive for this tumor type.\nThe former glycoform was also substantially more abun-\ndant than the latter and also seemed to contain more KS\nmoieties. Interestingly, structural determination of KS\nchains attached to thyroglobulin and transferrin, which\nwas accomplished through a fluorescent fingerprinting\nprotocol involving analysis of keratanase II-derived oligo-\nsaccharide fragments, highlighted the uniqueness of the\nPTC glycan chains and the modes by which these were\nassociated to these backbone polypeptides. In fact, a\nconsiderable portion of these moieties was not bound\nthrough the classical N- and O-linkages previously char-\nacterized for type I and II KS chains. PTC-associated KS\nmoieties were further found to be unusually long and\nhave a prevalence of neuraminic acid residues bound\nthrough an \u0003(2-6)-linkage and the nonreducing termini\nalso embodied novel oligosaccharide moieties. To our\nknowledge, this is the second detailed characterization of\nKS chains isolated from a tumor lesion,24 which, in addi-\ntion, highlights unique structural traits of this glycosami-\nnoglycan produced by a malignant tissue. The findings\nalso provide the grounds for approaching the structural\ncharacterizations of KS as a potential means to identify\nmalignancy-associated structural patterns in glycosami-\nnoglycan synthesis.\nWe believe that the elaboration of the unorthodox KS\nglycoforms of thyroglobulin and transferrin discovered\nhere constitute an elective trait of PTC that can be ex-\nploitable for different practical applications. From a sur-\ngical pathological point of view, it may represent a reli-\nable ancillary tool in the differential diagnosis of PTC\nversus benign conditions, such as nodular goiter, Graves\u2019\ndisease, Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, and follicular adenoma,\nwhich may exhibit PTC-like cyto-architectural alterations.\nIn fact, the PTC-specificity of mAb 373E1 seems to be\neven higher than that reported for mAb HBME-1, which\nmay be frequently used in the disclosure of malignant\nthyroid conditions and the specific detection of PTC.27\u201330\nAlthough variations in the glycosylation pattern of thyro-\nglobulin have been reported in thyroid tumors,37,38 they\nhave not been deemed to be sufficiently significant for\nbiological or clinical applications. The present study\nopens the possibility that the long-term, postoperative\nfollow-up involving the monitoring of serum thyroglobulin\nlevels, which is routinely adopted in surgically treated\nPTC patients, may be further improved by a more specific\nserological assessment of the levels of KS-bearing thyro-\nglobulin.\nTransferrin is known to be diversely posttranslationally\nmodified in hepatocellular carcinomas,39\u201342 but no infor-\nmation has previously been reported with regard to its\ncompositional traits in thyroid pathologies. Comparative\nevaluation of transferrin expression in PTC versus benign\nthyroid tissues revealed augmented levels of the glyco-\nprotein in PTC lesions. This indicates that the alteration of\ntransferrin in PTC occurred at all levels, ie, transcriptional,\ntranslational, and posttranslational, and was to some ex-\ntent corresponded by the analogous alteration affecting\nthe thyroglobulin gene. Interestingly, changes in the gly-\ncosylation profile of transferrin have been noted during\npregnancy,43 linking thereby the putative hormone-asso-\nciated prevalence of PTC in females with aberrant glyco-\nsylations traits of the protein in neoplasia. Finally, the\nrestricted anatomical distribution of KS in the neck region\nand the specific appearance of these hitherto described\nglycoforms in PTC also opens the avenues for the possi-\nble exploitation of antibody 373E1 and radiolabeled\ntransferrin (normally used for gallium-67-based imaging\nof lymphomas) for PET-based in vivo imaging of malig-\nnant thyroid lesions.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Dr. Mauro Melato, University of Trieste, Italy, for\nproviding a number of tumor samples; and Maria Teresa\nMucignat and Antonella Corsaro for invaluable technical\nassistance.\nReferences\n1.
