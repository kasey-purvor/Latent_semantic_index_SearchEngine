In recognition, Nigeria \nwas recently rated average in the World Bank investor protection index, which \ncovers transparency of transactions, liability for self-dealing, shareholders \nability to seek redress against officers and directors.1 However, the current \nCadbury Nigeria Plc (a subsidiary of Cadbury Schweppes) financial \naccounting saga (see appendix for details) ushers in a new dawn in corporate \ngovernance and accountability in Nigeria which challenges shareholders\u201f \nability to hold management to account through activism \u2013 a way by which \nshareholders can influence a corporation\u201fs behaviour by exercising their rights \nas owners.2  \n \nShareholder activism is not a new phenomenon in developed market \neconomies. O\u201fRourke did an historical analysis of shareholders activism which \ndates back to some sixty years in the U.S. She noted the 1946 landmark \nrequirement under US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule, \nwhich requires companies to include shareholder resolutions in proxy \nstatements. This has remained the rule till date. The 60\u201fs and 70\u201fs witnessed \nthe use of shareholder proxy to pressure companies in more areas such as \nproduct safety, environmental pollution and employment discrimination. In the \n                                                 \n1 See http:\/\/www.doingbusiness.org \u201aThe indexes vary between 0 and 10, with higher values indicating \ngreater disclosure, greater liability of directors, greater powers of shareholders to challenge the \ntransaction, and better investor protection\u201b. Nigeria scored 5 on the scale while the OECD average is 6 \n2 It is instructive to note that the irregularities in the Cadbury case was discovered after the parent \ncompany, Cadbury Schweppes, increased its stake in the company from 46% to 50%. This development \nquestions the ability of shareholders in Nigeria to act effectively within the corporate governance \nframework in the country.  \nPage 4 of 33 \n80\u201fs shareholder activism shifted to anti takeover activities, which according to \nO\u201fRourke may partly be due to a swing away from public interest movement \ntowards making companies more competitive. However, the call for social and \nenvironmental responsibility emerged again in the 1990\u201fs with increased \ninvolvement of shareholder activities. According to her, shareholder activist \ngroups in the US include individual shareholders, Non governmental \nOrganizations, Churches and religious groups, mutual and pension funds and \nother umbrella groups. \n \nThe aim of this paper is to explore how recent developments in Nigeria \ncontribute to shareholders activism and how to improve participation of \nshareholders in corporate governance \u2013 the distribution of rights and \nresponsibilities and responsibilities among different actors involved in the \ncorporate organization (Aguilera and Jackson, 2003). The extant literature on \ncorporate governance and accountability tends to take shareholder power and \ninfluence to enforce their rights as a given, and from this point of view often \nargue for stakeholder influence and empowerment, instead. This paper offers \na contrary perspective wherein shareholders power and influence is not as \npowerful as often assumed and presented in the extant literature. A fair \ntreatment of shareholders and their ability to have their voice heard is one of \nthe major issues at the core of best corporate governance practice (McNeil, \n2005). It is the position of this paper, therefore, that in order to increase \nparticipation in the financial market, in an economy such as Nigeria, it would \nbe necessary to gain shareholders\u201f confidence, by demonstrating that their \nPage 5 of 33 \ncompanies are being run and managed efficiently, and that they have a real \nrole to play in the company. \n \nFor the purpose of this paper, it would be necessary to make a distinction \nbetween universal share ownership and universal owners (Turnbull, 1993). \nAccording to Turnbull \u201ea \u201cuniversal owner\u201d is an institution which effectively \nowns a small portion of the economy\u201f, while universal share ownership \npresumes direct ownership by individual stakeholders. Universal ownership \nhas two important drawbacks, which were identified by Turnbull. In the first \nplace they may seek to maximize profits by externalizing social costs to \ntaxpayers whom they represent. Secondly, it also raises the problem of the \nsame owners being involved in the governance of competing firms. As noted \nby Maassen and Brown (2006), the composition of institutional (universal \nowners) investors varies widely and consequently affects their voting \ndisposition. They further noted that while institutional shareholders are \ncapable of influencing corporate behaviour, their effectiveness is widely \ndebated in the literature. It was noted that institutional investors, such as \nmutual funds, have tended to align with management and have been passive \nwhile institutional investors, such as public pension schemes, appear to be \nmore pro-active (Maassen and Brown, 2006:224). Studies have also found \nthat there are weak links between institutional shareholding and firm \nperformance, while the prospects of misdirection of shareholder activism also \naffect firm effectiveness (Maassen and Brown, 2006: 244\/245). Universal \nshare ownership, in the contrary, avoids the problems of universal owner by \nincreasing participation of other stakeholders, such as employees, ensuring \nPage 6 of 33 \nthat same owners do not participate in the governing of competing firms and \nthat institutional holding is not run in a way that transfers the costs of \nexternalities to people who may be the shareholders they are representing \n(Turnbull, 1997). The shareholder activism advocated in this paper primarily \nrelates to universal share ownership. \n \nFollowing ongoing corporate governance reforms and recent developments in \ninformation and communication technologies in Nigeria, this paper examines \nthe possible effects of these on shareholder democracy \u2013 by exploring the \nviability of mobilizing individual shareholders (i.e. universal share owners) in \norder to make them real actors in corporate governance and accountability in \nNigeria. Aguilera and Cuervo \u2013Cazurra (2004) suggested that there are at \nleast two possible ways of achieving this aim: one is for a country to reinvent \nits legal systems and the other is for a country to introduce new corporate \ngovernance practices into existing corporate governance systems. The paper \nargues that because of the peculiarity of the Nigerian situation, a combination \nof both approaches would be needed. The paper concludes that shareholders \nof Nigerian firms have the potential to positively influence corporate behaviour \nonly if they are able to exercise meaningful control over management.  \n \nShareholding practice and structure in Nigeria: overview and challenges \n \nThe Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) has been in existence for about 46 \nyears. According to the NSE, it has over 260 listed securities including 10 \nGovernment Stock, 55 industrial loans (Debenture\/Preferences) stocks and \nPage 7 of 33 \n195 equity\/ordinary shares of companies with a total capitalization of about \n875.2 billion naira.3 Shareholding in Nigeria has grown from a few thousands \nin the early 70s to an estimated 10 million. The privatization programme in \nNigeria has had tremendous impact on share ownership. According to Tanko \nII, (2004) in the first phase of the programme, privatized companies offered \nover 1.3 billion shares for sale to the public. Over 800,000 shareholders, many \nof them first time buyers, purchased the shares. Between 1989 and 2005, \nforty government-owned companies were privatized.   \n \nThe early companies in Nigeria were British based. By virtue of Colonial \nstatutes enacted between 1876 and 1922, the law applicable to companies in \nNigeria at this time was the \u201ecommon law, the doctrines of equity, and the \nstatutes of general application in England on the first day of January, 1900\u201f \nsubject to any later relevant statute. The implication of this approach was that \nthe common law concepts such as the concept of the separate and \nindependent legal personality of companies as enunciated in Salomon v. \nSalomon was received into the Nigeria Company law and has since remained \npart of the law (Orojo, 1992:17). However with continued growth of trade, the \ncolonialist felt it was necessary to promulgate laws to facilitate business \nactivities locally. The first company law in Nigeria was the Companies \nOrdinance of 1912, which was a local enactment of the Companies \n(Consolidation) Act 1908 of England; and even the current company law of \nNigeria (now known as the Companies and Allied Matters Act 1990 - CAMA) \nis largely modelled on the U.K Company Act, 1948 (Guobadia, 2000).  \n                                                 \n3 NSE information till 2003; see website \nPage 8 of 33 \n \nUnder the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) (the principal legislation \non company law in Nigeria) there are three organs of the company the general \nmeeting, the board of directors and the managing director (to the extent that \nthe board of directors delegate their power to the office).4 The two principal \norgans are the board of directors and the general meeting. The general \nmeeting is the shareholders acting in properly convened meetings. The \npowers of the two principal organs are set out in the articles of association of \na company.5  The board of directors are given the exclusive powers to \nmanage a company in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of \nAssociation of the company and are not bound to obey the directives of the \ngeneral meeting (shareholders) when acting in accordance with powers \nconferred by the articles of association and CAMA. However there are powers \nconferred on the shareholders under CAMA, which makes them, theoretically, \npotential effective force in corporate governance. These include default \npowers to act in any matter if the members of the board of directors are \nunable to act (because of a deadlock et cetera) or are disqualified from acting \nin that respect; instituting legal proceeding in the name of or on behalf of the \ncompany, where the board of directors refuse or neglect to do so; they also \nhave power to ratify or confirm actions taken by directors and to make \nrecommendations to the board of directors regarding actions to be taken by \nthe board of directors. Furthermore the shareholders acting in the general \nmeeting have the power over the appointment and removal of directors and \nalso to amend the articles of association to alter the powers of directors. \n                                                 \n4 S. 64 CAMA \n5  S 63 (2) CAMA \nPage 9 of 33 \n \nThere are usually two types of meetings under CAMA, the annual general \nmeeting and the extraordinary general meeting. Every company is expected to \nhold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) every year. Any member or members \nholding not less than one-tenth of the shares of the company at the date the \nrequisition is made may request for the holding of an extraordinary meeting. \nThe Annual General Meeting is the strongest forum for exerting shareholders \ninfluence in the Nigerian Corporate Governance schema. There are usually \nmany important issues of corporate governance, which need the assent of the \nshareholders at such meetings. For instance, the directors are required to \nprepare and place before the shareholders at the AGM the financial statement \nprepared in accordance with CAMA. The shareholders must have the \nstatements delivered to them at least 21 days before the AGM. The \nshareholders have the prerogative to either approve or reject the statement. \nSecondly, the AGM has the power to appoint and remove auditors of the \ncompany. An auditor is required to report to the shareholders on all the \naccount records and financial statements of the company. An audit committee \ncomprising of equal number of directors and representatives of shareholders \nis required to examine the auditors report and make recommendation to the \nAGM. \n \nTo facilitate adequate participation of shareholders, it is required under the \nlaw that a minimum notice of 21 days must be given to all persons entitled to \nreceive notice of the general meeting. A notice is however, deemed to be \nproperly given if properly addressed and posted. It is required that every \nPage 10 of 33 \npublic company advertises the notice in at least two daily newspapers 21 days \nbefore the meeting. However, given the weakness of the Nigerian postal \nsystem and the low readership of newspapers in Nigeria the possibility of not \nreceiving adequate notice is high. \n \nEffective exercise of shareholder\u201fs powers requires that as many \nshareholders as possible participate in the voting process.6 Only shareholders \nare entitled to vote on resolutions at general meetings. Where voting is done \nby a show of hands every member or proxy has one vote. Where voting is \ndone by a poll, a member\u201fs voting power will depend on his or her \nshareholding. A member is entitled to appoint another person including a \nperson who is not a member to attend, vote and speak on his behalf. \nHowever, the usual practice in Nigeria is that directors send out proxy papers \nby which they expressly put themselves forward to be nominated as proxies. \nThis practice according to Orojo (1992:290) inevitably strengthens the position \nof the directors at general meetings where a sizeable number of proxy papers \nare returned. \n \nThe CAMA allows a shareholder or group of shareholders to propose a \nresolution or make a statement for the consideration of a general meeting. \nThe shareholder(s) making such a proposal must be member(s) representing \nnot less than one twentieth, i.e. 5% of the total voting rights of all the members \nhaving at the date of the proposal a right to vote at the meeting or by one \nhundred or more members holding shares in the company which has been \n                                                 \n6 European Commission \u2018Fostering an Appropriate Regime for Shareholders\u2019 Rights: Second \nConsultation by the Services of the Internal Market Directorate General\u2019 MARKT\/13.05.2005 \nPage 11 of 33 \npaid up to an average sum of N500 (i.e. \u00a32) per member. Thus shareholders \nmay influence the direction a company takes via the use of shareholders\u201f \nresolution. However it has been observed that \u201emost Annual General Meetings \nin Nigeria are fraught with corruption. They are arranged in such a way that \nonce the leaders of the shareholders association are bribed in one way or the \nother shareholders only go to the event to sing the praises of management for \na robust account, instead of actually asking accountants to look more closely \ninto the accounts and raising pertinent questions (Gabriel, 2006). \n \nThe law makes some provisions for access to the court for redress for minority \nshareholders. This covers actions brought by an aggrieved shareholder for \nwrongs done to him personally or to take a derivative action in the name of the \ncompany. Furthermore sections 310-312 of the CAMA allows a shareholder to \nbring an action on the ground of unfairly prejudicial and oppressive conduct \nwith the court having a wide range of relief to chose from. However, despite \nthe legal provisions, there are many obstacles, which have discouraged a \ncoordinated shareholder activism in Nigeria. There are practical problems \nsuch as inadequacy of notices of statutory meetings, inaccessible venue of \nmeetings and inappropriate conducts of meetings. Other problems include \nlack of information, apathy on the path of shareholders and a weak judicial \nsystem.  \n \nAccording to Nmehielle and Nwachue (2004), Nigeria is not characterised by \none typology of company. Based on an historical analysis of shareholding \nstructure in Nigeria, they concluded that shareholding in Nigeria is generally \nPage 12 of 33 \ndiffused with few exceptions to the general rule leading to the classic Berle \nand Means (1932) model on the separation of ownership from control. \nNmehielle and Nwachue traced the diffusion of shareholding back to the \nindigenisation programme of the government in the 70\u201fs. Under the \nprogramme, Nigerians bought into companies erstwhile owned by foreigners. \nHowever while the Nigerian shareholding was fragmented, the foreign \nshareholding was intact, making foreign shareholders dominant partners. In \nthis regard, although local shareholders in many instances might be owners of \na company because of cumulative larger shareholding, foreigners remained in \ncontrol, especially because of the weighted voting share scheme which gave \nmore votes to foreign shareholders. This shareholding structure persisted \neven after the indigenisation scheme and the weighted voting scheme were \nabolished. Nmehielle and Nwachue further pointed out that by the listing \nrequirement of the Nigerian Stock Exchange, public companies on the First \nTier Securities Market are required to have at least 300 shareholders while \nthose on the Second Tier Securities Market are required to have at least 150 \nshareholders thus further fragmenting the shareholding structure in Nigeria.7 \n \nThe privatisation and commercialisation programme in Nigeria to some extent \nalso contributed to the fragmented share ownership in Nigeria as the enabling \nstatute prohibited the acquisition of more than 0.1% especially where the \nshares are oversubscribed.8 The exceptions to this general trend are private \nfirms and foreign and local institutional shareholding (which are few) (Limbs \n                                                 \n7 Under the listing rules of the Nigerian Stock Exchange, the securities market is divided into tiers \ndepending on the companies\u2019 capacity. See Nigerian Stock Exchange Fact Book, 2003. \n8 Section 5(4) of the Privatisation and Commercialisation Act, 1999 \nPage 13 of 33 \nand Fort, 2000; Oyejide and Soyibo, 2001). Furthermore, as Nmehielle and \nNwachue (2004) pointed out, the shift by the body charged with the \nprivatisation programme in Nigeria which actively sought core strategic \ninvestors holding 51% or more shares in some privatised companies has led \nto dominant shareholding in such firms. In a similar trend, Tanko (2004) \nobserved that Nigerian investors are so dispersed and the individual holdings \ngenerally small that they have no means of exerting any influence on the \nmanagement of companies post privatisation. According to Maassen and \nBrown (2006), \u201ewith widely dispersed share ownership, minimum standards for \nformal communication and disclosure must be regulated through corporate \nlaw and self-regulation such as voluntary corporate governance codes\u201f. They \nimportantly noted that \u201esuch communication, disclosure, and governance \nmechanisms will be of value only if the shareholders are empowered to act on \nsuch information.\u201f \n \nAccording to a survey by Oyejide and Soyibo (2001) Nigeria score poorly on \nfair conduct of shareholders\u201f meetings when compared to other emerging \nmarkets in the Middle East and North Africa. The survey covered important \nissues impacting on shareholders right such as the handling of general \nmeetings, prohibition of insider dealings, publication of director dealings and \ntransactions, adequate notification to shareholders, transparency, judicial \nremedies and access to information. The survey reveals that all shareholders \ndo not have equal access to information. In fact 95% of the respondents to the \nsurvey were of the opinion that there was no meaningful compliance to this \nrequirement and that compliance and enforcement is inconsistent. As regards \nPage 14 of 33 \nshareholders access to judicial remedies, 70% of respondents feel that there \nis no evidence of any legal\/administrative system with respect to shareholders \nrights while 25% was of the opinion that the system does not work. 75% of the \nrespondents were of the opinion that there was inconsistent quality of \ninformation during company meetings in Nigeria. While insider trading is \neffectively prohibited in Nigeria the survey shows compliance\/enforcement is \ninconsistent in the country. The recent case of Cadbury Nigeria Plc (see \nappendix) is an eloquent testimony to the shareholding challenges in Nigeria. \n \nRecent changes and developments towards shareholders \nempowerment, activism and strategic corporate governance in Nigeria \n \nAccording to Aguilera and Cuervo\u2013Cazurra (2004) the processes of \nglobalization \u2013 such as the liberalization and internationalization of \neconomies, developments in telecommunications, and the integration of \ncapital markets \u2013 and the transformation in the ownership structure of firms \u2013 \ndue to the growth of institutional investors, privatization and rising shareholder \nactivism \u2013 have led to increased attention been paid to corporate governance \nas a monitoring and accountability device. These processes have also \nimpacted on the Nigerian environment with the ongoing privatisation and \ncommercialization programme, the liberalization of the regulatory framework \nfor investment and the transformation in the communication sector. Some of \nthese changes have important bearing on shareholder activism within the \nlocal context.  \n \nPage 15 of 33 \nSome of the recent reforms towards shareholder empowerment in Nigeria \ninclude: a new code of corporate governance, formation of shareholder \nassociations and the emergence of information and communication \ntechnologies. Each of these changes and developments would be related to \nthe galvanisation of shareholder activism in Nigeria.  \n \nThe Code of Corporate Governance \n \nFollowing poor shareholding practices and further marginalization of \nshareholders in corporate democracy in Nigeria, a code of Corporate \nGovernance was adopted in 2003 by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the Corporate Affairs Commission which made a number of \nrecommendations to increase the level of shareholders influence in corporate \ndecision making process.  Code of corporate governance has been \nrecognised as \u201ea set of \u201ebest practice\u201f recommendations regarding the \nbehaviour and structure of a firms board of directors issued to compensate for \ndeficiencies in a country\u201fs corporate governance system regarding the \nprotection of shareholders\u201f rights\u201f (Aguilera and Cuervo \u2013Cazurra, 2004). The \nNigerian code thus focuses on shareholders unlike similar codes in other \nAfrican countries, which extended their scope to a broader range of \nstakeholders (Rossouw, 2005). A major recommendation of the code is that \nshareholders should work in concert through shareholders associations. \n \nSection 10 (a) of the code provides: \nPage 16 of 33 \n\u201eThe company or the board should not discourage shareholder \nactivism whether by institutional shareholders or by organized \nshareholders' groups. Shareholders with larger holdings \n(institutional and non-institutional) should act and influence the \nstandard of corporate governance positively and thereby \noptimize stakeholder value.\u201f \n \nRegarding the composition of Board of Directors, the code provides that \nshareholders with less than 20% or more shareholding should have a seat on \nthe board. It further provides that a Director representing the interest of \nminority shareholders should be given a seat on the board. The code further \nprovides for more regular briefings of shareholders going beyond going \nbeyond the half year and yearly reports. \n \nTo facilitate and improve the attendance of shareholders at general meetings \nof the company, the code states that venue for general meetings should be \nplaces that are possible and affordable \u2013 cost and distance wise \u2013 for a \nmajority of shareholders to attend and vote at annual general meetings. The \ncode further requires that notice of meeting be given at least 21 days before \nthe meeting and all details related to the agenda of a meeting should \naccompany the notice to enable shareholders properly exercise their vote. \nThe code envisages that the general meeting should be a forum for \nshareholder participation in the governance of the company. The changes in \ncode of corporate governance have contributed to strengthening of \nPage 17 of 33 \nshareholders in Nigeria and have begun to yield some fruits (e.g. Cadbury Plc \ncase). \n \nShareholders' Association  \n \nThe trend in developed economies, which saw the development of block \nvoting through shareholder associations as a response to domination by \nprincipal shareholders,9 is gradually evolving in the Nigerian context. The \nbonding together of shareholders in Nigeria has come both through private \ninitiatives and government intervention. In a bid to shore up public \nparticipation in the ownership of corporation the Nigerian government \nencouraged and facilitated the establishment of a network of Shareholder \nAssociations. Seven Zonal associations were established in 1992. The \ncountry was divided into seven zones and zonal headquarters were located in \nseven major cities, which are Kano, Kaduna, Jos, Ibadan, Lagos, Onitsha and \nPort Harcourt, respectively. Each of the Zonal Associations is registered with \nthe Corporate Affairs Commission; the government department charged with \nthe regulation of formation and management of companies the country.10 The \nassociations adopted a draft constitution provided by a government \ndepartment, the Bureau of Public Enterprises. The Government also ensures \nthat publicly quoted companies allocate seats to the associations on the board \nof corporations. Each of the zones has a board of Trustees, which is elected \nto hold office for life. There is also provision for an executive council charged \n                                                 \n9 \u2018Improving the Exercise of Shareholder Voting Rights at General Meetings in France\u2019 Report of \nWorking Group of the Authourite des Marches Financiers (AMF) \u2013 France Securities Regulator chaired \nby Yves Mansion, September, 2005 \n10 It also registers Business Names and Incorporated Trustees as well as providing a wide range of \nancillary services. The associations operate independently of each other. \nPage 18 of 33 \nprincipally with coordinating the affairs of the association, electing members of \ntheir zone to fill in any board vacancies by shareholders of the company \ninvolved, educating shareholders in their zones. Each zone keeps a register of \nshareholders in the privatised publicly quoted companies. According to \nEtukudo (2000) \u201ethe Association serves the interest of the investing public as \nshareholders who have the opportunity to contribute to the formulation of \nbroad corporate policies, thereby enhancing management accountability\u201f. \n \nAt its inception a government parastatal in charge of the privatisation and \ncommercialisation programme, the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), \nfunded the association from interest earned on deposit of shares pending \nallotment. The association is now funded through a per-capital levy placed on \nquoted companies. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the \nNigerian Stock Exchange determine the levy, based on the number of \nshareholders in each company. The fund is collected and administered by the \nStock Exchange. \n \nThough the association obtains professional guidance from the Nigerian Stock \nExchange, its activities are determined and solely carried out by its members \nin accordance with its constitution. The purpose of the Associations, as \nconceived by the government, is to ensure that Nigerians have representation \nand a voice in the running of the affairs of firms in which they invest. The \nduties of the association according to Etukudo (2000) include:  \n \nPage 19 of 33 \n\u201e-- educating and enlightening shareholders on their rights and \nresponsibilities;  \n-- promoting solidarity among shareholders and stimulating interest in \nthe activities of their company;  \n-- facilitating representative participation in corporate decision-making \nthrough regular attendance at annual general meetings as well as \nextra-ordinary general meetings;  \n-- nominating their representatives to serve on boards of directors of \npublicly quoted companies;  \n-- facilitating easy access to individuals to claim their dividends and \nscrip certificates some of which remain unclaimed due to ignorance of \ntheir whereabouts. \u201e \n  \nApart from the government established shareholder associations, there are \nalso independent associations of shareholders in Nigeria. These are usually \nregarded as activist associations put together for common causes, by \nindividuals with common interests.  The emergence of this private shareholder \nassociations shows that Nigerian investors are no longer solely interested in \nthe economic value of their shares but also in the right that share ownership \ngives them to influence corporate strategy and management.11 In the last 15 \nyears at least 30 shareholders association have been established.12 The \nincreasing number of these associations has led to recent moves by the \n                                                 \n11 Some of the major private Shareholder Association in Nigeria include \u2018 Independent Shareholders \nAssociation of Nigeria, Shareholders Solidarity Association of Nigeria, Nigeria Shareholders Solidarity \nAssociation, Nigeria Professional Shareholders Association, the Independent Shareholders Association, \nand the Association for the Advancement of Rights of Shareholders.  \n12 Sola Ephraim-Oluwanuga \u2018Role of Shareholders in Implementing the Code of Corporate Governance\u2019 \navailable at http:\/\/www.businessdayonline.com  \nPage 20 of 33 \nSecurities and Exchange Commission in Nigeria to regulate the \nassociations.13 \n \nOkike (2007) has opined that the emergence of these associations have led to \na rise in shareholder activism in Nigeria. According to her, after analysing \nrecent newspaper reports on shareholder associations in the country, \n \nContrary to the belief that shareholders in Nigeria are ignorant and \nnaive, the evidence of actions by the NSSA and other shareholder \nbodies points to the fact that such assumption is antiquated. In Nigeria \nshareholders have been known to challenge the actions of \nmanagement they believe were not taken in their best interest\u2026\u201f \n \nIt has been reported that shareholder associations have contrary to previous \npractice, rejected yearly account of some companies, opposed appointment of \ncertain directors and went to court to some proposed mergers (Okike, 2007).  \nA good example of this is the current case between Cadbury and local \nshareholders in Nigeria.14 It is thus obvious that if properly channelled, \nshareholder activism is a potential force for shaping the direction corporate \ndecision making takes in the country.  \n                                                 \n13 See Business Day, June 22nd, 2006 \u2013 \u2018SEC may review Audit Committee Membership\u2019. However it \nshould be noted that in the developed economies block voting through associations have transcended \nthe exclusive preserves of volunteers because of the emergence of service firms called \u2018proxy providers\u2019, \nwhich provides institutional investors and companies with large scale voting services.

Though \nsubscription to the Internet is low, but its availability and the availability of \nInternet cafes in all major towns in the country have increased access to \ninformation. Investors \/ shareholders now find it easier to access information \nabout companies and also to share information with other investors unlike \nbefore.  Majority of companies listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange now \nhave websites and use these to present their annual reports and other \nactivities that might be of interest to shareholders. \n \nIn addition to company websites, it is now possible to find websites where \ndiscussions are held on what investments to put money on.15 Furthermore the \nGlobal System of Communication makes it easier for shareholders to share \nviews and discuss issues. In other words, the internet technology and \n                                                 \n15 Examples of website where discussions are held include Nairaland \u2013 \nhttp:\/\/www.nairaland.com\/nigeria owned by a young Nigerian based in Ogun State, Nigeria. Also The \nNigeria Village Square \u2013 www.nigeriavillagesquare.com  \nPage 22 of 33 \neconomy has contributed to empowering shareholders in Nigeria and made \nmanagement much more susceptible to accountability pressures. \n \nIncreasing Shareholders participation in Nigeria: any lessons from \nabroad?  \n \nDespite the improvements from reformed code of corporate governance, \nformation of shareholders\u201f associations and developments in information \ntechnology, there are still room for improvements. Undoubtedly the Annual \nGeneral Meeting (AGM) is the most viable avenue for shareholders to exert \ntheir influence. It is therefore important to find ways of increasing shareholders \nparticipation in AGM. The recent developments regarding shareholder \nassociations demonstrates the fact that given the right atmosphere, \nshareholders in Nigeria would likely take active interest in the governance of \ncorporations. \n \nEven though the European Union is much more advanced in this area (like in \nmany other areas) than Nigeria, there are instructive lessons in developments \nin the EU, which could be adapted suitably to the Nigerian scenario.  While \nthe current challenges to shareholders democracy in the EU differ \nconsiderably from Nigeria and are largely linked to cross border equity \ninvestments, the steps that have been taken to ameliorate the situation are \ninstructive. This is relevant because the steps taken in the EU context were \nalso to increase shareholders participation in corporate governance. Under \nthe EU 2004 Transparency Directive, timely disclosure of information including \nPage 23 of 33 \nplace, time and agenda of meetings are required. The directive enables the \nusage of electronic means to pass information to shareholders (Maasen and \nBrown, 2006). Furthermore the Market Abuse Directive in its effect requires \nthat companies have Internet sites to which they must post all information that \nthey are required to disclose publicly. \n \nThere are many advantages to employing modern technologies in this regard. \nIt has been observed that in the US where there is a more common use of \nproxy solicitation through Internet and phones, cost is saved at the same time \na greater quorum is achieved. This is achieved by outsourcing the proxy \nprocess. According to Maasen and Brown (2006), ADP the largest proxy \nprocessing company in the US processed more than 153 million proxy pieces \ncovering more than 299 billion shares in 2005. A total of 168.2 billion votes \nwere cast electronically by phone Internet and Proxy Edge in the year. The \ncost of reaching out to shareholders was reduced by this method by more \nthan $ 370 million in 2005 due to savings on postage and paper. \n \nIn Nigeria the increase in the use of the Internet and the GSM system could \nprovide an avenue for increasing shareholder participation. For examples by \ndedicating a part of companies website to shareholder information, by \nensuring that shareholders can additionally be contacted through emails and \nthe global System for Mobile Communication and by facilitating the processing \nof shareholder\u201fs questions through these media. Furthermore, in view of the \nepileptic service provided by the postal system in Nigeria and the limitation \nattached to most system of communication in Nigeria due to poor \nPage 24 of 33 \ninfrastructure it is recommended that the length of notice of meeting be \nincreased from 21 days to sixty day and should be published on the website at \nthe same time. It is interesting to note that in Europe where there is adequate \ninfrastructure there is a pending proposal that notice of general meetings \nshould be a minimum of 30 calendar days and should be posted on the \nInternet   at the same time as it is published (Maasen and Brown, 2006). \n \nThe EU has proposed that shareholders in the cross border context should \nhave the right to ask questions at least in writing ahead of general meetings \nand get responses to their questions. The responses, it is proposed, should \nbe made available to all shareholders. This also could be adapted to the \nNigerian situation by allowing questions to be asked through the post and the \ninternet ahead of general meetings. \n \nConclusion and implications for corporate social responsibility in \nNigeria \n \nThis paper has examined opportunities for shareholder activism within the \nNigerian corporate governance schema in the light of recent developments. \nShareholder dominant theories \u2013 contract and agency theories \u2013 are of the \nview that because of the wide dispersal of shareholding, direct shareholders \ncontrol is hampered, consequently putting into question shareholder \ndemocracy and activism. Berle and Means (1932) seminal work The Modern \nCorporation and Private Property brought to the fore what has been subject of \nconsiderable debate in corporate governance for decades thereafter: the \nPage 25 of 33 \nseparation of ownership from control. Simply put, \u201eshareholders own an entity \nthat management runs\u201f (Marcus, 2003). However, Berle and Means qualified \nthe \u201eownership\u201f status of shareholders as passive owners who had \nsurrendered control to management. As Fannon (2003) further expounded, \nthe documented attitude of shareholders is to exit when there is dissatisfaction \nwith corporations\u201f performance rather than attempting to exert influence, as \ntrue owners of property would do to rectify any shortcoming \u2013 a phenomenon \ncommonly refer to as rational neutrality or indifference.  The consequence of \nthis is that share price becomes the sole indicator of shareholders view in the \ncorporate structure. It is thus assumed that the option for any dissatisfied \nshareholders is to sell and leave the corporation. \n \nHowever, the political model of corporate governance as it interacts with the \ntheory of power and cybernetic analysis provides a different perspective \n(Turnbull, 1997). The political model of corporate governance at the micro \nlevel of the firm has been described as an approach \u201ein which active investors \nseek to change corporate policy by developing voting support from dispersed \nshareholders, rather than by simply purchasing voting power or control\u2026\u201f \n(Pound, 1993). This model of governance is based on politics rather finance \n(Pounds, 1993) and recognizes the existence of political market place apart \nfrom government establishments. According to Turnbull (1993), possession of \npower to act where the knowledge and will to act is present, is an integral part \nof political model of corporate governance. Power relation among \nstakeholders is important because even where there is greater disclosure and \ntransparency shareholders must possess both the power and the will to act. \nPage 26 of 33 \nThis echoes the Focauldian conception of power as power only when it is \nexercised (Kearins, 1996). However power would only be rightly exercised \nwhere the relevant stakeholder is in possession of accurate information that is \ntimely, sufficient and manageable (Turnbull, 1997)  \n \nThe political model of corporate governance as described above would \nexplain the emergence of shareholder activism in its various manifestations in \nrecent times. According to O\u201fRourke (2003), \n \n\u201eShareholder groups are increasingly going beyond the decision to \ninvest, not to invest, or to divest by proposing and voting on company \nspecific corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues at annual \nshareholder meetings. This activity is joined by an increasing \nsophisticated \u201estrategy of engagement\u201f by both shareholders and \ncompanies. In the process, a model of investor capitalism based on \n\u201eresponsible ownership\u201f is being forged that addresses social and \nenvironmental issues previously outside the domain of most \nshareholders\u201f. \n \nThe connection between shareholder activism and corporate social \nresponsibility is under-emphasised in CSR discourses. Instead, shareholders \nare often presented as \u201eruthless capitalists\u201f who are only driven by profit \nmaximisation. However, the emergent and growing interest in social \nresponsible investments (SRI) seems to contrast sharply with what has \nPage 27 of 33 \nbecome a conventional misrepresentation of shareholders\u201f interest in the \nextant CSR literature. \n \n In a recent paper on CSR in Nigeria, Amaeshi et al. (2006) found that CSR in \nNigeria is dominantly understood and practised as corporate philanthropy, \nwhich is most of the time driven by the whims and caprices of management. In \nthis regard, there is a high risk of management pursuing their interests and not \nnecessarily those of shareholders (i.e. investors) \u2013 thereby feathering own \nnests, reputations and personal aspirations, instead, at the expense of \nshareholders wealth. In addition, Amaeshi et al. concluded that the attraction \ntowards corporate philanthropy is driven by the corporate governance \nframework in which these firms are embedded. Whilst not being critical of this \ncultural and institutional bias, this paper argues that there are opportunities in \nthe ongoing corporate governance reforms in Nigeria that would give \nindividual shareholders voice in moving the firms they invest in beyond \ncorporate philanthropy to meeting their strategic objectives and adding real \nvalue to the Nigerian economy. For instance, shareholders ability to hold \nmanagement to account would encourage management to be more strategic \nin their approach to CSR instead of relying on personal interests and \naspirations expressed through corporate philanthropy. It is the conclusion of \nthis paper that shareholder empowerment in corporate decision making is a \npotential avenue for influencing corporate attitude towards CSR as evidence \nfrom the US and EU has demonstrated.  \n \n \nPage 28 of 33 \nReferences \n \n \nAguilera, R.V., and Cuervo-Cazurra A.

Concerns have been raised particularly because \nof the company\u201fs high profile in the private sector and domestic economy and \nas a major player on the Nigerian Stock exchange. The fact that it took \nCadbury Schweppes, the parent company\u201fs intervention to discover the \nirregularities have called into question the capacity of the Nigerian corporate \ngovernance environment and framework . It must be observed that the \nfinancial accounts in question were scrutinized and approved by the Nigerian \nStock Exchange, the Security Exchange Commission and most importantly in \nthis connection the shareholders of the company. \n \nCadbury Nigerian Plc has been listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange since \n1976, and is in the top 10 of the 258 quoted equities by market capitalizations \nas of year end 2003.
