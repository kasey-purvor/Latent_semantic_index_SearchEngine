Psychology, as a discipline, has suffered from both experimental and \ncognitive reductionism that have constructed \u2018inter-group relations\u2019, \u2018cultural difference\u2019 \nand discrimination in somewhat essentialised, ahistorical and decontextualised accounts. The \nideological construction of cultural difference, the possibilities for social and political \nchange and our human capacity for dialogue, debate and resistance receive far less \nattention than often dry, empirical accounts of intergroup competition and conflict and the \npsychological consequences of threatened identities and stereotyping. Multiculture is often \nassumed to be simply another type of intergroup relations that we can apply our well-worn \ntheories of social categorisation and social identification. Within Sociology, cultural studies \nand political science, by contrast, multiculturalism is a fiercely debated and extensively \nresearched topic.  \n \nRather than leave our friends and colleagues in neighbouring disciplines to led debates in \nacademic, policy and community spheres, I would suggest that we need to enter into dialogue \nourselves and offer a range of perspectives on the psychology of multiculture. Clearly we do \nneed an understanding of the psychological dynamics at stake here: to make sense of \nmulticultural contexts, encounters and identities we need to ask when and why do cultures \nappear multicultural? That is, when are we psychologically aware of difference, or, more \naccurately, how is difference intersubjectively constructed? This question takes us to the \nvery heart of Social Psychology and to the birth of self-consciousness, the development of \nsocial identities and the possibilities for self-reflection, dialogue and agency. To understand \nhow and why we develop a sense of \u2018ourselves\u2019  - we need an awareness of \u2018others\u2019 who we \nmake different to us and whose difference clarifies our sense of identity, community and \nculture. We may see connections and disconnections, similarities and differences, \nopportunities for dialogue and the potential for bloodshed. However, we do not do this alone \n\u2013 happily or nervously making sense of the connections and disconnections of human \nencounters. Our understanding of identity, culture and difference is something we inherit \nand is bound to the material consequences of long histories of othering, racialised violence \nand cultural oppression. Hence we need to develop a dialogical account of multiculture that \nintegrates an understanding of the social psychology of difference and subjectivity with a \npolitics of cultural difference and the possibilities for dialogue and social change.   \n \nPolitical scientist Paul Nesbitt-Larking\u2019s stimulating paper on multiculturalism provides an \nexcellent opening to such an inter-disciplinary debate. Critical responses from social \npsychologists, sociologists and political scientists make for a fascinating exchange as to \nwhat we see at the key issues in academic constructions of multiculture and the possibilities \nfor dialogue. Situated together these pieces demand that we develop a more engaged \ndiscussion across the politics and the psychology of culture, difference and dialogue. Not \nonly is this because we need a contextualised understanding of multiculture, but also \nbecause there are important political consequences to the ways in which we construct, \nnegotiate and resist the construction of multiculture, both in the everyday and in the \nreified world of Psychology. It is to this objective that Nesbitt-Larking and the \ncommentators make a significant contribution.  \n \n \nDr Caroline Howarth \nSPRRaM: Social Psychological Research into Racism and Multiculture \nSocial Psychology \nLondon School of Economics and Political Science \n \nc.s.howarth@lse.ac.uk \nhttp:\/\/www.psych.lse.ac.uk\/socialpsychology\/research\/racism\/sprram\/ \n \n \n"}
