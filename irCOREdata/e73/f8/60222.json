One of the \nmain methodologies for determining D\/\u0397 and 18O\/16O, focuses on measuring \u03b4D on extracted \ninclusion fluids and calculating \u03b418O of the fluid by analysing the host quartz. Recently, \nprocedures that analyse both \u03b4D and \u03b418\nIn this study, we present directly and indirectly measured \u03b4D and \u03b4\nO on inclusion fluids have been developed for quartz \nand carbonates (Kishima and Sakai, 1980; Kazahaya and Matsuo, 1984; Ohba and Matsuo, \n1988; Lecuyer and O\u2019Neil, 1994).  However in quartz, scientific opinions as to which \napproach is the most appropriate are divided (Vityk et al., 1993; Ohba et al., 1995).  The \nindirect approach is not ideal as it relies on accurate determination of quartz precipitation \ntemperatures, usually ascertained through fluid inclusion microthermometry.  Also there is \nevidence for isotopic disequilibrium between quartz and the fluid phase at low temperatures \n(<250 \u00b0C) (Zhang et al., 1995; Matsuhisa et al., 1978).  Direct measurements also have \nproblems as isotopic re-equilibration can occur after trapping and during cooling of the host \nmineral (Rye and O\u2019Neil, 1968; Ohba et al., 1995). \n18O data for adularia-\nsericite epithermal-Au mineralisation at Profitis Ilias on Milos island (Aegean sea).  A deposit \nclosely linked to a modern geothermal reservoir, and whose geology, mineralogy and fluid \ninclusions are well characterised (Kilias et al., 2001).  In addition, the modern system is well \ndocumented mineralogically, geochemically and isotopically (Liakopoulos, 1987; Liakopoulos \net al., 1991; Pflumio et al., 1991; Christanis and St. Seymour, 1995) and provides an excellent \nanalogue for the epithermal-Au mineralisation. \n 2 \n2 Geological setting and background information \n2.1 The geology of Milos island \nMilos is located on the active Aegean volcanic arc (Fig. 1).  Volcanism, on Milos is Pliocene\u2013\nPleistocene in age and calc-alkaline in nature and resulted from the north-eastward subduction \nof Mediterranean sea floor (part of the African plate) below the Aegean microplate \n(Papazachos and Kiratzi, 1996 and references therein).  The geology, geochronology, \ngeothermal activity and structure of the island are described in detail by Fytikas (1989, and \nreferences therein), Briqueu et al. (1986), Liakopoulos et al. (1991), and Tsokas (1996) and its \nmain geological features are shown in Fig. 1.  Though the last recorded volcanism ceased \n100,000 years ago, Milos is currently an active geothermal field.  Present day activity is \nconcentrated in the central and eastern portions of the island and is expressed by fumaroles, \nhot springs, hot ground, and submarine gas escapes (Fig. 1). \n2.2 Epithermal gold mineralisation at Profitis Ilias \nThe geology, mineralogy and fluid inclusions of Profitis Ilias have been described in detail by \nKilias et al. (2001), and only the salient features are reiterated here.  \nThe deposit is classified as a low-sulphidation epithermal gold-deposit and host rocks consist \nof strongly sericitised rhyolitic lapilli-tuffs and ignimbrites.  The mineralisation, comprising \nnative gold, minor sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite and pyrite, is developed in a series of \ninterconnected N-S to NE-SW trending vein networks that occupy a fault network.  Vein \nwidths are up to 3 m across and extend to depths of at least 300 m below the present-day \nsurface.  Three broad paragenetic stages to the mineralisation are recognised: (i) barren pre-\nore comprising microcrystalline quartz and pyrite; (ii) fine-grained and vuggy quartz with base \n 3 \nmetal sulphides and native gold and (iii) post-ore fine-grained quartz and barite with minor to \ntrace sulphides. \nFluid inclusion homogenisation temperatures show either show narrow (25\u201350\u00b0C) or large \nranges (>150\u00b0C) that are not evenly distributed throughout the depth profile.  In the lower \nlevels of the hydrothermal system (below 430 m above-sea-level [asl]) only the narrow range \nis observed, whilst above this level samples exhibiting a widely varying temperatures \npredominate (Tab. 1).  In terms of Th\n1. A high\u2013salinity trend, where rapidly increasing salinity (3 to 15 wt % NaCl eq) is \nassociated with gradual decreases in homogenisation temperature.  This trend is seen \nthroughout hydrothermal system. \n\u2013salinity relationships, the data fall into two distinct \ntrends: \n2. High\u2013Th\nIn addition to the above, the lowest homogenisation temperatures, at each sample depth, \nclosely follow a depth-to-boiling curve.  This feature is seen in modern geothermal systems \n(e.g. Hedenquist et al., 1992; L\u00fcders et al., 2001) and provides a reference curve for \nestimating quartz precipitation temperatures (Tab. 1) \n trend, where a diffuse tendency of decreasing salinity is associated with \nincreasing temperature.  This trend only occurs in the upper parts of the hydrothermal \nsystem (> 430 m asl). \nKilias et al. (2001) concluded that the fluid inclusion data coupled with geochemical data \nstrongly imply that extreme boiling and vaporisation played a major role in mineralisation.  In \naddition, they noted that a zone, located at approximately 430 m asl marks the transition \nbetween a liquid- and vapour-dominated system.  These results show that the studied samples, \n 4 \nat the deposit scale, can be treated as being temporally and compositionally consistent and \nprovide a coherent framework to interpret the stable isotope data. \n2.3 The modern geothermal system: chemical and isotopic characteristics \nIn the active geothermal system, the reservoir liquid, before phase separation is moderately \nsaline (~9 wt % dissolved salts) and after phase separation the condensed vapour has a salinity \nof 0.12 wt % NaCl.  Geochemically, the residual liquid phase is dominated by sodium \nchloride (up to 14.3 wt % NaCl) with significant potassium (1.1 wt %) and calcium (0.5 wt \n%).  In addition, magnesium (1.36x10-4 mol\/l) and sulphate (1.04x10-5 mol\/l) are strongly \ndepleted compared to seawater.  During its ascent to the surface, the hydrothermal fluid \nseparates into liquid and vapour phases (Liakopoulos, 1987; Liakopoulos et al., 1991).  In \nterms of stable (\u03b418\n3 Mater ials and methods \nO, \u03b4D) isotope systematics, the deep reservoir comprises a fluid that \nresulted from a Rayleigh-type distillation of seawater accompanied by partial re-equilibration \nwith volcanic rocks as the seawater percolated down through the system (Pflumio et al., \n1991). \n3.1 Sample selection and preparation \nSample selection for isotopic analysis was based on fluid inclusion microthermometry and \nelevation data.  The criteria were that quartz samples contained only a single inclusion type \nwith an inclusion population dominated by primary\/pseudosecondary inclusions and that they \ncovered most of the vertical range of the deposit.  In total, eleven quartz samples were \nselected for analysis (Tab. 1).  Approximately 10 g of quartz from each sample were crushed \nand sieved to \u20131000\u00b5m +500\u00b5m.  The quartz concentrates were then washed in hot (c. 90 \u00b0C) \n 5 \n6M HCl several times with a final rinse in hot (c. 90 \u00b0C) Milli Q water to remove \u201csoluble\u201d \nimpurities adhering to the surface of the quartz grains (e.g. iron oxides).  This was followed \nby ultrasonic cleaning in cold Milli Q water for 5 minutes to removed \u201cinsoluble\u201d surface \nimpurities (e.g. clay minerals).  Any contaminants left were then removed by careful hand \npicking under a binocular microscope to give a pure quartz concentrate weighing between 0.5 \nand 1.0 g.  Immediately prior to analysis, the sample was briefly ultrasonically cleaned in \ndichloromethane to remove any remaining organic material. \n3.2 \u03b418\n\u03b4\nO and \u03b4D from fluid inclusions \n18O and \u03b4D in fluid inclusions were determined using a modified methodology based on \nKishima and Sakai (1980), Kazahaya and Matsuo (1984), and Lecuyer and O\u2019Neil (1994).  \nBetween 0.5 and 1g of hand picked quartz grains were degassed at ~20 \u00b0C overnight under \nvacuum. Samples were then decrepitated at 600 \u00b0C for 30 minutes and the fluid inclusion \nwater collected cryogenically.  This water was then transferred to a micro-equilibration quartz \ntube sealed at one end, to which 2cm3 of a standard CO2 gas was added, and the tube \ncompletely sealed. The tube was then weighed and the H2O and standard CO2 gases were left \nto exchange oxygen isotopes at 25 \u00b0C for 7 days.  After equilibration, H2O and CO2 were \nseparated cryogenically.  The water was converted to hydrogen by reduction over hot zinc and \nratios measured on a SIRA 10 mass spectrometer.  CO2 was collected and ratios determined \non an Optima mass spectrometer along with a sample of the standard gas used for the \nequilibration.  The \u03b418O values of the water samples were calculated using the mass balance \nequation of Kishima and Sakai (1980) and the CO2-H2O fractionation factor at 25 \u00b0C \ndetermined by O\u2019Neil et al. (1975). The \u03b418O value of standard CO2 used for equilibration \nwas 31.85 \u2030 (SMOW), a value close to that expected for the CO2 after equilibration.  Since \n 6 \nthe oxygen isotope ratio of the CO2 only changes slightly during the equilibration, the \nprecision was not compromised. The weight of fluid inclusion water released from the quartz \nwas calculated from the weights of the collection tubes before and after the H2O-CO2 \ncollection.  The water content of each sample was variable, but in most cases 0.5 to 1 g of \nquartz yielded between 0.5 and 4 micro-litres of water (Tab. 1).  At each stage in the \nextraction procedure the line pressure was monitored to check for residual gas.  Precisions \nobtained for the laboratory standard water, extracted and measured at the same time, were 0.1 \n\u2030 for \u03b418\n3.3 \u03b4\nO and 3 \u2030 for \u03b4D (2\u03c3) for samples between 1\u20132 micro-litre quantities of water.  The \ndata are presented as permil (\u2030) deviations from VSMOW. \n18\nSilicate ratios were obtained from the quartz after fluid inclusion extraction, using the \nprocedure outlined by Clayton and Mayeda (1963).  Oxygen yields were monitored and \nconsidered acceptable within the range 99\u2013103% of the theoretical yield.  Isotope ratios were \nmeasured on a CJS Sciences mass spectrometer (phoenix 390, rebuilt VG MM903).  \u03b4\nO from quartz \n18\n4 Stable isotope results \nO \nvalues were normalised through laboratory standards and NBS28, and corrected according to \nCraig (1957) and Deines (1970). The data are presented as permil (\u2030) deviations from \nVSMOW.  Overall analytical reproducibility was of the order of \u00b1 0.10 \u2030 (2\u03c3).  \n4.1 Oxygen data \nThe oxygen isotope data show correlations between sample-elevation and \u03b418O in both fluid \ninclusion waters (\u03b418OFI) and quartz (\u03b418Oquartz) (Tab. 1 and Fig. 2).  With the exception of the \nsample from the highest elevation, \u03b418OFI decreases from -3.7 \u2030 at 210 m asl to -7.3 \u2030 at \n 7 \n613 m asl.  \u03b418Oquartz shows an opposite trend, increasing from +13.9 to +15.1 \u2030.  However, \nto directly compare the quartz and fluid inclusion water data, \u03b418Oquartz needs to be corrected \nfor temperature dependent fractionation effects between quartz and the hydrothermal fluid \n(\u03b418Ocorrected).  However, in low to moderate temperature epithermal systems (<250 \u00b0C), \ncorrect estimation of quartz precipitation temperatures from fluid inclusion temperatures can \nbe difficult and errors in temperature estimate can result in significant uncertainties in isotopic \ncompositions \u2013 at 200 \u00b0C, an uncertainty of +\/\u2013 20 \u00b0C in the fluid inclusion homogenisation \ntemperature corresponds to a 2.5 \u2030 uncertainty in \u03b418Ofluid\nFig. 2 compares \u03b4\n.  Furthermore, at Profitis Ilias, \nwhere there is with a temperature difference of approximately 100 \u00b0C between the lowest and \nhighest elevations, uncertainties of this magnitude are greater than the total range in the \nmeasured quartz oxygen isotopic composition (1.2 \u2030).  Several choices of temperature \nestimate are available to us.  First there is a single value, e.g. 225 \u00b0C, that corresponds to \nestimated boiling temperatures, but there is a clear variation in temperature over the \ninvestigated elevation interval (see Tab. 1).  Second, average sample homogenisation \ntemperatures (Tab. 2) could also be appropriate.  However in this case, there is good evidence \nfor heterogeneous trapping (Kilias et al. 2001), which will make this choice an overestimate.  \nThird, minimum homogenisation temperature of each sample (Tab. 1), which represents fluid \ninclusions that have trapped the least vapour, are also valid estimate (see Pichavant et al. \n1982; Ramboz et al. 1982 and Bodnar et al., 1985, for discussions that relate homogenisation \ntemperatures, boiling and heterogeneous trapping).  Last, we have depth-to-boiling \nrelationships to estimate fluid temperatures (Tab. 1). \n18Ocorrected, \u03b418OFI and \u03b418Oquartz with sample elevation, using the above \nmethods for estimating temperature.  First, it is clear that trends in the data, alluded to earlier, \nare systematically related to sample elevation.  Second, there is a difference of about +8 to \n 8 \n+12 \u2030 between \u03b418OFI and \u03b418Ocorrected\n1. Use of a single temperature value preserves the \u03b4\n.  Closer examination of the corrected data raises a \nnumber of further points: \n18\n2. Employing Mean homogenisation temperature results in significant scatter, and makes it \ndifficult to differentiate any data trends. \nO-depth trend seen in the quartz data, \nwhich is still in the opposite sense to the inclusion water data. \n3.

Applying temperature estimates calculated from the boiling curve, with the exception of \nthe sample from the highest elevation, results in a trend with little scatter that closely \nparallels the inclusion water. \nO-depth trend is in a similar sense to that of the inclusion \nwater. \n4.2 Hydrogen data \n\u03b4D of inclusion waters (\u03b4DFI) varies between \u201368.0 and \u201319.0 \u2030.  \u03b4DFI\n4.3 Correlations between stable isotope, fluid inclusion and geochemical data \n shows a reasonable \ncorrelation with sample-elevation (Fig. 3), with eight of the eleven samples analysed falling \non a linear trend varying from the light values (\u201347.8 \u2030) at high elevations (613 m asl) to \nheavier data (\u201319 \u2030) at lower altitudes (210 m asl). \nIn addition to isotope\u2013elevation data, it is also possible to examine the relationships between \nstable isotope, fluid inclusion and geochemical data (Au and Ag).  It is clear that 430 m asl \nmarks a distinct transition (Fig. 5).  First, \u03b4D and \u03b418OFI water show a significant decrease to \n 9 \nlighter values and relative changes in \u03b4D closely parallel those in \u03b418OFI water.  Second, fluid \ninclusion homogenisation temperatures start to show a high degree of variability above 430 m \nasl.  Here, individual samples commonly record Th ranges in excess of 100\u00b0C, whilst below \nthe transition temperature ranges are generally less than 20 \u00b0C.  This variation correlates with \nthe shift in \u03b418OFI and \u03b4DFI to lighter values.  Third, at 430 m asl metal contents start to \nincrease and gold contents are commonly greater than 20 ppm. In comparison the variation in \n\u03b418Oquartz\n5 Discussion \n shows a gradual change along the entire depth profile and there is no clearly marked \nchange at 430 m asl.   \n5.1 Combined \u03b4D and \u03b418\nComparison of the paleo and modern systems show that \u03b4\nO and comparisons with the modern geothermal system. \n18OFI has a number of features in \ncommon with the modern system.  It has a similar range in oxygen isotope composition, and \ncombined \u03b4DFI\u2013\u03b418OFI is close to the vaporisation\u2013mixing trend described by Pflumio et al. \n(1991) (Fig. 5).  In addition, the variation in the isotopic composition of the fluid inclusion \nwaters is modelled by boiling processes.  Fig. 5 shows two steam separation trends that match \nthe \u03b418OFI data.  Here, the heavier samples, in both \u03b4D and \u03b418O, are located at the lowest \nelevations and are within the liquid-dominated portion of the hydrothermal system (below \n~430 m asl) and correspond to the highest temperatures in the system.  Conversely, the \nlightest samples are located in the vapour-rich part (above ~430 m asl) and have highly \nvariable fluid inclusion temperatures indicative of heterogeneous trapping of liquid and \nvapour (Figs 4 and 5).  The observed depth\u2013temperature\u2013isotopic variation in \u03b418OFI can be \nexplained by the trapping of varying physical mixtures (as fluid inclusions) of residual liquid \nand steam, with each \u201cquartz extraction\u201d recording an \u201caveraged\u201d isotopic composition.  In \n 10 \nthis manner, samples from the higher elevations will contain more steam and record the \nlightest \u03b4D and \u03b418O values, whilst those in the deeper portions will be more representative of \nthe reservoir and residual fluid compositions.  However in terms of \u03b418Oquartz compositions, \nirrespective of the temperature used to calculate quartz\u2013water fractionation, the \u03b418Ocalculated \n5.2 The quartz\u2013inclusion water \u03b4\ndata plot well to the right of the meteoric water line, in a scattered manner that cannot be \nrelated to the modern geothermal system and have no obvious trends.   \n18\nTable 2 compares \u03b4\nO shift \n18OFI and \u03b418Ocorrected \nFirst, Rye and O\u2019Neil (1968) analysed \u03b4\nand clearly shows calculated fluid compositions do \nnot equate with those measured in the fluid inclusions.  In most cases, irrespective of the \nchoice of temperature, calculated compositions are generally 5\u201310 \u2030 heavier than the \nmeasured fluid inclusion waters.  To address the reasons for this, let us examine the limited \nnumber of cases in the literature where both quartz and inclusion water have been analysed \n(Tab. 3). \n18O in inclusion waters hosted in calcite, sphalerite \nand quartz and concluded that \u03b418OFI undergoes post-trapping exchange with quartz.  \nHowever, these conclusions are based on limited data and large samples (Tab. 3).  Thus, it is \npossible that they did not sample a single generation of quartz or fluid.  This is important as \nHyashi et al. (2001) have shown that in epithermal quartz \u03b418Oquartz can vary by up to 7 \u2030 in \non a millimetric scale.  Thus, without knowing the homogeneity of the material and \nconsidering the small number of quartz samples analysed it is difficult to assess the effects of \npost-trapping re-equilibration from this data alone.  \n 11 \nSecond, Vityk et al. (1993) and Ohba et al. (1995) analysed both \u03b418OFI and \u03b418Oquartz from the \nBeregovo epithermal and Kaneuchi tungsten deposits and had significantly different results.  \nVityk et al. (1993) record two distinct types of quartz and fluid inclusion.  In the first, isotope \nand fluid inclusion temperatures agree and microthermometry indicates a compositionally and \nthermally homogeneous hydrothermal fluid (salinity: 1\u20132 wt % NaCl eq.; Th: 190\u2013215 \u00baC).  In \nthe second, isotope and fluid inclusion temperatures disagree and microthermometric data \nvary considerably (wt % NaCl eq: 0\u201316 wt % Th: 170\u2013260 \u00baC).  Also, fluid inclusion waters \nextracted from sulphides (sphalerite and galena) and co-existing quartz have very similar \n\u03b418OFI and \u03b418DFI (Tab. 3).  These data lead to their conclusion that in epithermal systems \ninclusion fluids can preserve \u03b418\nIn contrast Ohba et al. (1995), for relatively high temperature (300\u2013400 \u00baC) and old (c. 91 Ma) \nhydrothermal quartz, show that positive \u2206\nO over geologic time. It is also important to note that \nBeregovo is a relatively young deposit (c. 15 Ma). \n18Ocorrected\u2013FI is due to post-trapping diffusional \nexchange.  However, it is important to note that in both Rye and O\u2019Neil (1968) and Ohba et \nal. (1995), formation temperatures for hydrothermal quartz were in excess of 300 \u00baC.  It is \nknown from experimental work (Matsuhisa et al. 1978; Zhang et al., 1989), that at \ntemperatures in excess of 300 \u00baC equilibration between quartz and water is relatively rapid \n(circa 30\u2013100 hours) whilst at temperatures lower than 250 \u00baC isotopic equilibrium is not \nachieved.  Thus, for both of these studies, due to the high precipitation temperature of the \nhydrothermal quartz and the time elapsed since mineralisation some post-trapping exchange \nby diffusion can be expected.  But in lower temperature (<250 \u00baC) young (<15 Ma) epithermal \ndeposits, such as Profitis Ilias and Beregovo, re-equilibration by diffusion may not occur.  \nHere, as the quartz cools rapidly from hydrothermal to ambient temperatures, slow \u03b418O \ndiffusion rates may prevent significant post-trapping exchange.  This is indicated qualitatively \n 12 \nat Beregovo, where one type of quartz has clearly not undergone any significant post-trapping \nexchange (Tab. 3). \n5.3 Modelling of post-trapping exchange by diffusion \nWe can examine post-trapping exchange by diffusion by looking at Dodson closure \ntemperatures (Dodson, 1973 and 1979) for \u03b418O in quartz.  This approach is particularly \nsuccessful in systems dominated by volume diffusion (Valley 2001) and \u03b418\n( )\n( ) \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb \u2212\n=\ntTE\naDARTLn\nRET\nc\nc\n\u03b4\u03b4\n2\n0\n2\nO diffusion \nbetween the wall of a fluid inclusion and bulk quartz is one example of this. \n (1) \nThe Dodson equation (eqn. 1) defines the closure temperature ( cT [K]) in terms of a \ndimensionless diffusional anisotropy parameter ( A ), the gas constant ( R [Jmol-1K-1\n0D\n]), the pre-\nexponential diffusion coefficient ( [m2s-1 E]), activation energy ( [J]), distance over which \ndiffusion takes place ( a [m]) and cooling rate ( tT \u03b4\u03b4 [Ks-1]).  As individual fluid inclusions \ngenerally have small volumes (<0.125 \u00b5l), then diffusion and exchange of \u03b418O between host \nquartz and inclusion water over short distances will significantly effect the composition of \ninclusion water.  For example, a 1 \u00b5m thick shell of quartz surrounding a 10 \u00b5m spherical \nfluid inclusion represents over 70% of the inclusion volume (Fig. 6A).  Thus, it is necessary to \nexamine closure temperatures for diffusion distances at the micron and sub-micron scale.  Fig. \n6B shows quartz closure temperatures at a variety of diffusion distances and cooling rates.  \nFrom this is clear that the closure temperature of \u03b418O in quartz, even for very short distances \n(c. 0.01 \u00b5m), is higher than most epithermal mineralisation (c. 250 \u00baC) for cooling rates in \n 13 \nexcess of c. 100 \u00baC\/Ma.  This means that in low to moderate temperature epithermal deposits, \nthe \u03b418O of inclusion water will not be significantly modified by post-trapping exchange with \nquartz.  However, in higher temperature (300\u2013400 \u00baC) hydrothermal systems, Fig. 6B shows \nthat quartz is not closed to \u03b418O diffusion.  Hence, post-trapping diffusion will take place and \nthe \u03b418O composition of the inclusion water will be modified.  Also, in higher temperature \nsystems, the degree of exchange will be dependent on inclusion size, as for a given distance \nand cooling rate smaller inclusions will have proportionally more quartz to exchange with \nthan larger inclusions (see Fig. 6A).  This relationship between inclusion size and degree of \npost-trapping exchange has been recorded by Ohba et al. (1995).  Thus, for high temperature \n(>300 \u00baC) hydrothermal systems, \u03b418Oquartz data coupled with accurate knowledge of quartz \nprecipitation temperatures are better estimators of \u03b418Ofluid than \u03b418OFI\n5.4 Kinetically controlled fluid\u2013mineral exchange during quartz formation \n.  However, in lower \ntemperature systems (<250 \u00baC), quartz closure temperatures indicate that fluid inclusions do \nnot re-equilibrate with quartz during cooling, and to this Vityk et al (1993) show that quartz\u2013\nfluid inclusion isotope temperatures associated with a specific quartz type are in good \nagreement with fluid inclusion microthermometry.  However, for the Profitis Ilias samples and \nother quartz types at Beregovo, isotope temperatures do not agree (see Tabs. 2 & 3).  Thus, in \nthe epithermal examples, the fact that some isotope temperatures agree and others suggests \nthat another process must be responsible for the differences. \nDubinina and Lakshtanov (1997) provide a different perspective into reasons for the quartz\u2013\ninclusion water \u03b418O shift. They show that providing no other isotopic equilibration \nmechanism operates (e.g. diffusion) complete isotopic equilibrium between a mineral and a \nfluid phase cannot be achieved through kinetically controlled solution\u2013precipitation processes.  \n 14 \nDubinina and Lakshtanov (1997) expressed the degree of isotopic exchange (F) between \nquartz and fluid, where the quartz has a silica gel precursor, as \ne0\ni0\n\u2206\u2212\u2206\n\u2206\u2212\u2206\n=F  (2) \nWhere 0\u2206 , i\u2206 and e\u2206  are differences in \u03b4-values between fluid and (i) silica gel ( 0\u2206 ), (ii) \nfreshly precipitating quartz ( i\u2206 ) and (iii) quartz at equilibrium ( e\u2206 ). Additionally, they \ndescribed the degree of exchange (F) in terms of total mass of water (w) total mass of mineral \n(M) and mass of dissolved and re-precipitated mineral (m) as \n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb +\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\u2212\u2212=\nM\nw\nw\nmF 1exp1  (3) \nEquation (3) means that during solution\u2013precipitation, isotopic fractionation between mineral \nand fluid can exceed the predicted equilibrium value of \u2206mineral-fluid.  This has been recorded \nexperimentally by  Zhang et al. (1989), who document \u2206i - \u2206e\nThe modelling predicts changes in isotopic composition as an unstable mineral is transformed \nisochemically into a stable one and is particularly relevant to epithermal systems where \ncrystalline quartz can have amorphous precursors (e.g. Dong et al., 1995).  The following \nequation describes variations in the bulk isotopic composition of quartz (\n values of +8.3 \u2030 during the \nearly stages of a 250 \u00baC silica gel\u2013water isotope equilibration experiment. \ns\nB\u03b4 ) formed during \nsolution\u2013precipitation processes (for a detailed discussion of its derivation see Dubinina and \nLakshtanov, 1997): \n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\u2212\u2212\u2206\u2212\u2206\u2212=\nw\nm\nm\nw i\nA\ns\nB exp1)( 00\u03b4\u03b4  (4) \n 15 \nWhere 0A\u03b4  is the initial isotopic composition of the amorphous (unstable) phase, \n0\u2206  is \nderived from the initial isotopic compositions of the fluid ( 0w\u03b4 ) and the unstable silica phase \n( 000 wA \u03b4\u03b4 \u2212=\u2206 ), \ni\u2206  is calculated from the initial fluid composition and quartz\u2013water \nfractionation at the temperature at which the solution\u2013precipitation process take place \n( \u03b1\u03b4 Lnw\ni 10000 +=\u2206 ) and \nw\nm  represents the re-precipitated mineral\u2013fluid ratio as the amount \nof quartz formed ( m ) changes from 0 to M .  To model how kinetic processes relate to our \nmeasured quartz compositions we need to estimate the initial isotopic compositions of the \nfluid, the unstable silica phase and temperature.  A first approximation of solution\u2013\nprecipitation temperatures can be estimated from fluid inclusion data (c. 225 \u00baC).  For the \ninitial fluid, the composition of the modern reservoir (+3 \u2030 \u2013 Pflumio et al., 1991) provides a \ngood analogue for the paleo-system at Profitis Ilias.  Kita and Taguchi (1986) measured \nisotopic fractionation factors between colloidal silica and a geothermal fluid at 76 and 88 \u00baC \nwhere silica was allowed to precipitate by evaporation of the geothermal fluid (this is broadly \nanalogous to Profitis Ilias, where mineralisation is associated with extreme boiling and \nvaporisation \u2014 Kilias et al., 2001).  Fig. 7 reproduces their data and compares it with \nfractionation factors for various equilibrium silica\u2013water pairs.  From this it is clear that \nsilica\u2013water oxygen isotope fractionation, under evaporative conditions, is non-equilibrium. \nMoreover, \u220618Osilica\u2013water\n0\u2206\n  appears to increase with temperature, though it would be difficult to \nextrapolate these data to higher temperatures it would be reasonable to use the higher \ntemperature value (+14 \u2030) as a minimum estimate for .  Using the above information and \nequation 4 we can model the bulk isotopic composition of quartz formed from a \u201ccolloidal\u201d \nprecursor at 225 \u00baC.  Fig. 8A illustrates this and three features are evident: (i) the final \ncomposition of transformed quartz is dependent on fluid\u2013mineral ratios, (ii) compositions are \n 16 \napproximately 3 \u2030 heavier at low mineral\u2013fluid ratios \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb = 05.0\nM\nw  than at isotopic \nequilibrium and (iii) with 10>\nM\nw  kinetic processes start to approximate equilibrium quartz\u2013\nwater fractionation.  In terms of our \u03b418Oquartz data, if we take the deepest and hottest sample \n(PD9380 in Table 1) to be most representative of the reservoir composition, \u03b418Oquartz and \n\u03b418OFI can be modelled by solution\u2013precipitation processes, using equation 4 the measured \n\u03b418Oquartz 05.0=M\nw (+14.5 \u2030) predicts an initial fluid composition of 0.7 \u2030 (T = 225 \u00baC, , \n140 +=A\u03b4  \u2030), which is very close to the measured \u03b4\n18OFI\nAt Profitis Ilias the fluids were boiling and temperatures of quartz formation vary \nsystematically with depth (Tab. 1).

These provide a reasonable \nestimate of temperature\u2013depth variation within the Profitis Ilias hydrothermal system and \nlocate the quartz samples in temperature\u2013\u03b418O space. The data show a steep antipathetic \nrelationship between \u03b418Oquartz and temperature that is modelled by solution\u2013precipitation \nprocesses with a solid mass ratio of 0.25 and, with the exception of the lowest and highest \ntemperature samples, an initial fluid varying in composition by about 1 permil, (Fig. 8B).  \nMoreover, the data do not conform to an equilibrium model of quartz precipitation.  Though \nkinetic processes can explain variation in \u03b418Oquartz with respect to estimated paleo-\ntemperatures, relating \u03b418Oquartz to \u03b418Ofluid through solution\u2013precipitation is more challenging \nas this requires knowledge of \u220618Osilica\u2013water for the quartz precursor.  In our case a value of \n+14 \u2030, taken from Kita and Taguchi (1986), predicts a fluid composition in the region of 0\u20131 \n\u2030 (Fig. 8B).  This is in approximate agreement with the sample that best reflects the reservoir \ncomposition of the hydrothermal fluid (PD9380 \u2013 Tab. 1) and the estimated composition of \nthe modern geothermal reservoir, but samples from higher levels record lighter values (to \u20137.8 \n\u2030) that are not predicted by solution\u2013precipitation processes.  However, these can be \n 18 \nexplained by heterogeneous trapping of liquid (\u03b418\nIn addition when we consider Vityk et al.

For \nsamples where isotope and fluid inclusion temperatures agree, quartz precipitated in \nequilibrium with the hydrothermal fluid or if it formed from a precursor silica phase then fluid \nto solid ratios were high.  That is conditions of open flow.  For samples where isotope and \nfluid inclusions record different temperatures (\u220618Ocalculated\u2013FI: 2.2\u20138.5 \u2030), \u220618Ocalculated\u2013FI can \nbe explained by quartz forming through solution\u2013precipitation processes at low fluid to solid \nratios (Fig 9A).  That is when fluid-flow was restricted and\/or it underwent extensive boiling.  \nThis feature has been observed at lower temperatures by Kita and Taguchi (1986).  When we \nconsider the alternative of post-trapping diffusional exchange as a mechanism for the \u03b418O \nquartz\u2013inclusion water shift in Vityk et al. (1993), it is difficult to explain the variation.  First, \nit would be expected to affect all samples equally.  That is for a given size of fluid inclusion, \nquartz age and mineralisation temperature, \u220618Ocorrected-FI should be constant in all samples.  It \nis not, some show no shift, whilst others show \u220618Ocorrected-FI\n5.5 What does fluid inclusion \u03b4\n to +8 \u2030 (Tab. 3).  In terms, of a \ndiffusion mechanism this can only be explained by significantly different quartz ages or that \nfluid inclusions that are significantly larger in one type of quartz.  Vityk et al. (1993) do not \nindicate that either of these are applicable to the Beregovo quartzes. \n18\nThe modelling of Dodson closure temperatures for quartz show, theoretically, that for \ninclusions larger than about 5 \u00b5m and at temperatures less than 250 \u00baC, quartz does not \nO represent? \n 19 \nsignificantly exchange \u03b418\n1. the epithermal mineralisation at Profitis Ilias shows a consistency between \u03b4\nO with fluid inclusion water.

On Milos, there is close isotopic and chemical similarity between the composition of the \nfluid inclusion waters and that of the modern geothermal system (see Fig. 5) and there \nare sound geological reasons that a continuum exists between the ancient and modern \nsystems (Kilias et al. 2001). \n data (see Fig. \n5). \n3. The data of Vityk et al. (1993) record quartz\u2013fluid inclusion isotope temperatures that \nagree with fluid inclusion data and cannot be explained by diffusion alone.  Also quartz \nand co-existing sulphides have similar \u03b4DFI and \u03b418OFI\n4. The modelling of solution\u2013precipitation processes show that kinetic factors are a valid \nalternative to post-trapping re-equilibration for explaining differences between \n\u03b4\n (see Tab. 3) \n18Ocalculated and \u03b418O\nThus the above, lend support that, in epithermal systems, \u03b4\nFI \n18O determined on fluid inclusion \nwaters may be a better guide to the original isotopic composition of the hydrothermal fluid \nthan temperature-corrected quartz data (Fig. 5).  This is because \u03b418Oquartz in solution\u2013\nprecipitation processes can be significantly different from \u03b418Oquartz at equilibrium for a given \ntemperature and \u03b418Ofluid.  However, in higher temperature (>300 \u00baC) hydrothermal systems, \nsuch as porphyry-Cu, Sn-W and orogenic-Au deposits, Dodson closure temperatures show \n 20 \nthat quartz and fluid inclusion water undergo post-trapping exchange.  Thus in these cases, the \nindirect method will always provide the best estimate of fluid \u03b418\nAlso, at Profitis Ilias, \u03b4\nO \n18OFI contains a record of fluid processes not seen in \u03b418Ocalculated (Fig. \n5 and section 5.1).  First, this is probably because temperature estimates within paleo-\nhydrothermal systems are not precise enough to allow accurate reconstruction of variations in \n\u03b418O of the hydrothermal fluid.  For example, in a boiling epithermal system fluid \ntemperatures can vary by up to 50 to 70 \u00b0C over a vertical interval of only 100\u2013200 m (Tab. \n1).  This can represent differences of nearly ten permil in fluid \u03b418O (i.e., the difference in \nboiling-curve estimated \u03b418O between 457 and 657 m elevations \u2014 Tab. 1).  Second, \nformation of quartz via an amorphous precursor (e.g. Dong et al., 1995) is a non-equilibrium \nprocess and can result in estimates of \u03b418Ofluid\n5.6 Implications for \u03b4\n that are too heavy.  \n18\nAt Profitis Ilias combined \u03b4D\u2013\u03b4\nO analysis of quartz \n18Oquartz and \u03b4D\u2013\u03b418OFI and comparison with the modern \ngeothermal system coupled with kinetic modelling of the data (Figs. 6 and 9) show that the \ndifferences in \u03b418Oquartz and \u03b418OFI can be related though a combination of extensive boiling \nand quartz formation via an amorphous precursor.  Whereas calculation of equilibrium fluid \ncompositions appears to over-estimate the fluid composition by + 8 to +10 \u2030. If the Kinetic \nmodel is valid, this places limitations on the use of \u03b418Oquartz in low-temperature epithermal \nsystems to estimate \u03b418Ofluid where solution\u2013precipitation processes operate.  This is because \nfailure to recognise them can result in significant errors in the estimation of \u03b418Ofluid.  \nObservations that indicate that \u03b418Oquartz is kinetically controlled and mitigate against the use \nof quartz to calculate fluid compositions are: \n 21 \n1. Textural information that indicates that it formed from an amorphous precursor (e.g. \nDong 1995).  This can be documented through careful petrography and \ncathodoluminescence studies. \n2. Fluid inclusion data that indicate that mineralisation is associated with extensive boiling \nand vaporisation (e.g. Simmons and Browne 1997, Scott and Watanabe, 1998; Kilias et \nal., 2001). \n3. Where mineralisation temperatures are less than 250 \u00baC, and data are available, \nsystematic differences between \u03b418Oquartz and \u03b418OFI\n6 Summary and conclusions \n can also indicate a kinetic control. \nIn summary, \u03b4D and \u03b418O in extracted fluid inclusion waters from the Profitis Ilias epithermal \nmineralisation were found to show a linear correlation that closely parallels the stable isotope \nsystematics in the active Milos geothermal system, with \u03b4D varying from \u201323.8 to \u201368.0 and \n\u03b418O from \u20133.7 to \u20137.8.  \u03b418O analysis of the quartz, using the same samples, showed a \nrestricted variation of 13.4\u201315.9 \u2030 and correction of this data, employing a variety fluid \ninclusion temperature estimates, does not match \u03b418O in the corresponding fluid inclusion \nwaters. \u220618Ocorrected\u2013FI ranges from + 8 to +12 \u2030 and calculated Dodson closure temperatures \nfor quartz, at scales appropriate to fluid inclusions and at cooling rates compatible with the \nlifetime of a geothermal systems, indicate that at temperatures below 250 \u00baC these differences \ncannot be accounted for by post-trapping diffusional exchange of 18O between inclusion water \nand host quartz.  Thus, for the Profitis Ilias mineralisation, post-trapping re-equilibration is \nnot thought to be an appropriate process for explaining the observed \u220618Ocorrected\u2013FI.  In our \ncase, solution\u2013precipitation processes are preferred as modelling shows that differences, in \n 22 \nrelative terms, between \u03b418OFI and \u03b418Oquartz can be explained by kinetic processes.  However, \ninsufficient data and knowledge concerning the \u03b418\nThe results of diffusion and kinetic modelling coupled with independent lines of evidence, \nsuch as the consistency of \u03b4D\nO composition of possible silica precursors \nat temperatures above 150 \u00baC and fluid to solid ratios preclude a generalised reconstruction of \nfluid compositions using this method. \nFI and \u03b418OFI with other geochemical data and their similarity to \nthe isotope systematics of the modern systems, lead us to believe that fluid inclusion \u03b418O has \nthe potential to be a better estimator of oxygen isotope systematics in low-temperature \nhydrothermal systems than \u03b418Oquartz and fluid inclusion temperatures.  However, as there are \nonly two fluid inclusion \u03b418O studies in the epithermal environment, further data from other \nsystems are required to extend the applicability our findings.  In the first instance, these should \nconcentrate on boiling systems as these provide the best temperature constraints.  In addition, \ngood petrographic and geologic control is a pre-requisite for reliable interpretations. In our \ncase, this was achieved through detailed petrography and fluid inclusion microthermometry \nwithin a well-constrained spatial and geological framework (Kilias et al., 2001) that enabled \ncomparisons between a mineralised system and its modern analogue.  At a smaller scale, or in \nthe absence of a modern analogue for comparison careful cathodoluminescence petrography \ncoupled with localised isotopic analysis of the quartz will also fulfil the requirement.  Finally, \nrecent analytical developments for the rapid determination of \u03b4D and \u03b418O in small (0.1 \u00b5l) \namounts of water (Sharp et al., 2001) indicate it should be possible to routinely analyse \ninclusion waters without the need for the lengthy sample preparation and analytical procedures \nthat have to date hindered systematic investigations into the applicability of oxygen isotope \ndetermination of fluid inclusion water. \n 23 \n7 Acknowledgements \nThis work was funded by the British Council, The Greek General Secretariat of Research and \na Marie Curie Experienced Researcher Fellowship to JN (HPMF-CT-2000-00762).
