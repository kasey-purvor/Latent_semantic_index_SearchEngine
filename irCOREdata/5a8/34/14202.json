Boyle and David J.

Research from\nthe United States has shown that an electronic classroom communication system (CCS)\ncan be used to support active discussion in large lecture classes. This investigation\nextends that research and it evaluates students' and teachers' experiences of CCS\ntechnology in the context of two different modes of discussion \u2014 peer-group and class-\nwide discussion. With CCS technology, students' answers to multiple-choice concept\ntests are collated in real time with the class results fed back as a histogram. This\ninformation serves as the trigger for each mode of discussion. This paper explores the\nunique contribution of CCS technology, the relative strengths of peer- and class-wide\ndiscussion and some practical implementation issues.\nIntroduction\nThere is now a considerable body of research that shows that deep and lasting learning is\nfostered when students actively engage with the concepts they are learning and construct\ntheir own understanding of them (for example, DeCorte, 1996; Hake, 1998; Glaser, 1990;\nPalinscar, 1998). Discussion, debate, questioning and explaining are some of the activities\nthat have been shown to support active learning and the construction of meaning in the\nclassroom (for example, Laurillard, 1993; Cohen, 1994; Matthews, 1996; Springer, Stanne\nand Donovon, 1999). Yet, in most universities, lecture classes usually carry large enrolments\nand this militates against active engagement and discussion. Moreover, class sizes are unlikely\nto diminish given government policies on wider access in the UK and elsewhere. In response\nto this dilemma a growing number of teachers have, in recent years, been searching for ways\nof making large classes more interactive (Bligh, 2000; MacGregor, Cooper, Smith and\n43\nJames T. Boyle and DavidJ. Nicol Using classroom communication systems in large class settings\nRobinson, 2000; Edwards, Smith and Webb, 2001). One approach that has proved successful\nin the United States is to use new technology to manage discussions in large lecture classes.\nThe Physics Education Research Group (PERG) at the University of Massachusetts\n(Dufresne, Gerace, Leonard, Mestre and Wenk, 1996) and investigators from the Galileo\nProject Group at Harvard (Mazur, 1997; Crouch and Mazur, 2001) have been researching\nways of improving conceptual learning in the sciences. The basic approach adopted by\nthese researchers is to break up lecture inputs with concept questions (multiple choice\ntests) and in-class discussions using a classroom communication system (CCS). A CCS is a\nsoftware\/hardware configuration that makes it possible for students to signal their\nresponses to the concept questions using handset transmitters and for these responses to be\ncollated in real time and publicly displayed as a histogram. It is this feedback that is used to\ntrigger and sequence in-class discussions.\nResearch has shown that these technology-supported discussion methods lead to\nimprovements in students' conceptual reasoning and examination performance (Crouch\nand Mazur, 2001; Defresne et al., 1996). These findings are interpreted from a social\nconstructivist perspective (Palinscar, 1998). The argument is that in-class discussion forces\nstudents to explain, analyse and defend their answers to concept questions in the face of\nquestioning by others with different perspectives. This results in more robust and elaborate\nmental constructions of concepts than would occur in more traditional lecture classrooms\n(see Nicol and Boyle, 2003, for a more fine-grained analysis of these processes).\nThis paper describes an initiative in an engineering department in a large university where\nclassroom technology was used to support in-class discussion with large numbers of\nstudents. It begins with an explanation of why the department decided to change its\nteaching methods.\nConcerns about teaching and learning\nIn 1998 the 'New Approaches to Teaching and Learning in Engineering' (NATALIE)\ninitiative was launched at the University of Strathclyde. The aim was to revitalize teaching\nand learning in the undergraduate degree programme of the Department of Mechanical\nEngineering. Three areas of concern led to this initiative. First, lecturers had noticed that\nmost first-year students had difficulty acquiring a deep understanding of certain core\nconcepts. As one lecturer put it 'even the brightest students make inexplicable blunders in\nthe application of these concepts'. This is backed up by research in the sciences which has\ndocumented the existence of such 'misconceptions' or 'alternative conceptions'\n(McDermott, 1984; Brumby, 1984; Halloun and Hestenes, 1985; West and Pines, 1985).\nThey usually occur when the concept conflicts with intuitive beliefs and\/or when the\nconcept is highly complex, involving multiple, and often interacting, components.\nA second concern was the increasing numbers in lecture classes which limited the potential\nfor interaction and discussion. Lecturers complained that because the flow of information\nwas mainly one-way it was difficult to identify when students were experiencing difficulties.\nA third area of concern was the motivation of the students. Some lecturers argued that new\ntechnology and the information rich society had undermined the value of lectures.\nNowadays, students preferred to concentrate for short intense periods on a task or to\nmultitask rather than to concentrate for long periods of time in lectures.\n44\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 3\nThese three concerns - weak conceptual understanding, insufficient interaction and\ndiscussion and low levels of motivation - led staff in the department to search for new\nways to teach mechanical engineering.\nAddressing the concerns using technology-supported discussion\nRealigning teaching and learning\nTwo years of preparation preceded the implementation of the NATALIE initiative. During\nthat time staff from the Department of Mechanical Engineering researched how engineering\nwas taught in a range of institutions in the United States. The model of teaching and learning\nthat was subsequently adopted centred on the idea of 'interactive engagement' (Hake, 1998)\nwhich emphasizes learner activity and dialogue. Drawing on the work of both Mazur (1997)\nand Dufresne et al. (1996), two discussion sequences were integrated into the mechanical\nengineering lecture classes - peer instruction and class-wide discussion (see Table 1).\nPeer instruction: Mazur sequence Class-wide discussion: Dufresne sequence\n1. Concept question posed I. Concept question posed\n2. Individual thinking: students given time to think 2. Peer discussion: small groups discuss the\nindividually (1-2 min) concept question (3-5 min)\n3. Students provide individual responses 3. Students provide individual responses.\n4. Students receive feedback - poll of responses 4. Students receive feedback - poll of responses\npresented as histogram display presented as histogram display.\n5. Peer discussion: students instructed to convince 5. Class-wide discussion: students explain their\ntheir neighbours that they have the right answer answers and listen to the explanations of others\n6. Retesting of same concept (facilitated by tutor)\n7. Students provide individual responses (revised 6. Lecturer summarizes and explains 'correct'\nanswer) response\n8. Students receive feedback - poll of responses\npresented as histogram display\n9. Lecturer summarizes and explains 'correct'\nresponse\nTable I: The sequence of activities for peer instruction and class-wide discussion\nTable 1 shows the differences in the discussion methods used within these two sequences.\nMazur only uses peer discussion whereas Dufresne uses both peer discussion and class-\nwide discussion. During class-wide discussion, the lecturer facilitates discussion by asking\nstudents from different groups to explain to the class the reasoning behind their answer.\nAs well as addressing the three concerns highlighted above, this study was also designed to\nadd to the research literature on technology-supported discussion. In previously published\nresearch, the different discussion methods used by Crouch and Mazur (2001) and Defresne\net al. (1996) have been shown to produce learning gains but they have never been directly\ncompared. This study examines the relative merits of peer and class-wide discussion from\nthe perspectives of students and teachers. In addition, little is known about how students\nexperience learning in the 'wired classroom' or about how teachers adapt to these\ndiscussion methods and the associated technology. This study also provides some new\ninsights into these processes.\n45\nJames T. Boyle and DavidJ. Nicol Using classroom communication systems in large class settings\nDescription of the Engineering Mechanics class\nIn this paper we report on the implementation in 2000-1 of these discussion methods in an\nEngineering Mechanics class, a two-credit first-year class run over two twelve-week\nsemesters consisting of two two-hour sessions per week. Students were organized into\ngroups of four. They sat in these 'peer groups' throughout the year. The first five weeks of\nthe class comprise an overview of the teaching methodologies to be used and a review of\nschool material. The review allows the Personal Response System (PRS) to be introduced\nwith subject material that is already familiar. New topics are then introduced in two-week\nsequences. Two lecturers facilitated these interactive sessions. The intake in 2000-1\nconsisted of 117 students.\nThe classroom technology used to support these discussion methods was a PRS marketed\nby Varitronics. PRS comprises a computer and a data projector used to present the concept\ntests, a set of handsets that allow students to signal their responses to these tests and wall-\nmounted sensors (receivers). The PRS software allows class responses to be collated almost\ninstantaneously and displayed as a histogram or bar chart (for a more detailed description,\nsee Comlekci, Boyle, King, Dempster, Lee, Hamilton and Wheel, 1999).\nExample concept tests\nFigures 1 and 2 show two concept tests that are used to initiate discussion on the notion of\na contact force. Contact force results from Newton's Third Law of Motion (to every action\nthere is an equal and opposite reaction). When introduced to this concept most students\ncan be led to the common-sense understanding that when standing your weight is pressing\ndown on the floor, so the floor must be pushing back with the same force. The force that\npushes back up is the contact force. The first question (Figure 1) is intended to remind the\nstudents of their school studies. They normally correctly identify that the contact force is\nequal to the weight of the crate. However, when asked the second question the majority of\nstudents choose Option No.2 - that the contact force remains the same as the weight. The\nin-class discussion that follows would normally involve students exploring the idea that the\ncontact force must be greater than the person's weight if the lift is accelerating (that is there\nis an unbalanced force to cause motion). They may also discuss the importance of using\nforce diagrams (rather than common sense), to analyse motion problems.\nEvaluation methodology\nThe evaluation explored the perceptions and experiences of students and lecturers in the\ninteractive classroom. The main objectives were (1) to ascertain whether these technology-\nsupported teaching methods would help address the three concerns raised by academic\nstaff - weak conceptual understanding, insufficient interaction and discussion in class, and\nlow student motivation and (2) to compare the two different discussion methods (peer and\nclass-wide discussion).\nEvaluation methods: students\nThree evaluation methods were used with students. First, discussions were held with five\nfocus groups of six students. This gave a sample size of 25 per cent of class enrolment.\nEach group met twice - once while 'class-wide discussion' was being used (Week 7) and\nonce while peer instruction (Week 10) was being used. The second author (DJN) and two\n46\nALT-\/ Volume \/ \/ Number 3\nConsider the picture below\nthat shows a crate sitting on\nthe floor.\nThe contact force between\nthe crate and the floor is:\n1.

The first\nauthor (JTB) lectured in the class.\nThe second method was a survey that comprised thirty-six statements. The statements were\nderived from the focus group data. Issues raised in the focus groups were analysed,\ninterpreted and categorized independently by the research team from the recordings. Once\nagreed, the issues were then re-formulated into single-sentence statements and linked to a\nfive-point Likert scale (see Table 2). The range descriptors were from 'strongly agree' to\n'strongly disagree'. While most statements were phrased in the positive sense some were\nphrased in the negative to discourage rote responses. Five statements also asked students to\nprovide a short reason for their answer. The survey was administered in class at the end of\nthe semester. Responses were anonymous. Only a subset of the survey responses is reported\nhere. Other data are reported in Nicol and Boyle (2003).\nThe third evaluation method involved the use of a critical incident questionnaire. This was\nadapted from Brookfield (1995) and comprised a single sheet of A4 with five questions and\nspace for comments. This was distributed to students in Week 5 when both discussion\nsequences were in use. A typical question was: At what moment in the class did you feel\nmost engaged with what was happening? Why? The intention of this evaluation was to find\nout about students' immediate experiences in an interactive class.\nEvaluation methods: staff\nA focus-group discussion was held with a group of six teaching staff at the end of the\nacademic year about their experiences in preparing materials for, and teaching in, PRS-\nsupported classes. This group included the two lecturers who taught Engineering\n47\nJames X Bcy\/e and David J. Nicol Using classroom communication systems in large class settings\nMechanics, four lecturers who taught other classes within the same department and one\nlecturer from another department (mathematics).\nResults: experiences of students\nIn this section we report on students' experiences of learning in the interactive classroom.\nThe results are organized around three headings related to the three concerns that led to\nthe NATALIE initiative.\nThe students' results comprise both qualitative and quantitative data. The quotes in the\ntext below present a qualitative account of students' experiences. These are drawn from the\nfocus-group discussions and from the written responses to the survey statements. These\nquotes are linked in the text to the quantitative data from the survey. Each set of data\ncomplements the other. The survey data has been organized into three tables (Tables 2, 3\nand 4) and referenced to the three headings (concerns). When referring to these Tables in\nthe text that follows [T2:S1], for example, would refer to Table 2, survey statement 1.\nConceptual understanding\nIn the focus groups and survey the majority of students reported that in comparison with\ntraditional lecture classes, the teaching methods used in the Engineering Mechanics class\nwere more effective in helping them acquire an understanding of fundamental engineering\nconcepts [T2:S1]. They also reported in the focus groups that the 'PRS methods' (their\nterminology) helped raise their awareness about which concepts were most appropriate to\nsolve particular classes of engineering problems. This was confirmed in the survey [T2:S2].\nNumber Survey statement Students Students\nagree diasagree\n1.

Responses I and 2 have been combined to represent the percentage of students\n'agreeing' with each statement and similarly responses 4 and 5 represent the percentage 'disagreeing'.\nThe ordering of statements in the table follows the text and was not the order of presentation to students.\nTable 2: Student responses to end of semester survey\nA number of reasons were given by students to account for their enhanced conceptual\nunderstanding. First, all students in the focus groups reported that the question and\nanswer sequence resulted in more active involvement in learning when compared with\ntraditional lecture-based classes. This was also confirmed by the survey [T2:S3]. The\nfollowing is a typical student comment:\n48\n74\n75\n95\n91\n24\n12\n4\n6\n1\n0\n24\n63\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 3\nWith 100 people in the class [traditional] you normally just sit there without being\ninvolved . . . and add to your notes. In the NATALIE class everybody's involved, you\nhave to think about what's being said . . . you have to stay awake . . . but it's more fun,\nyou get more from i t . . . better than just sitting taking notes.\nNot only did students report that they were more actively engaged in learning but they also\nnoted that they had more time 'to stand back' and reflect on concepts in a way that was not\npossible in most other lecture classes [T2:S4]. The opportunity to reflect was again seen to\nbe a direct result of the structure of the sessions where there was a break after the\npresentation of material to think about the concept question alone or to discuss it in peer\ngroups.\nYou have more time to think in that class because, it's structured, it's broken up. In a\nstandard lecture it's difficult to spend time understanding the concepts . . . you've got to\nkeep up with the lecture . . . going ten to the dozen . . . and take notes. I mean in an\nordinary lecture you might get through a lot of work but you won't understand what's\ngoing on.\nAccording to the survey data the students' increased understanding was not perceived to be\nat the cost of more time spent studying outside class [T2:S5]. It is also notable that, in the\nfocus groups, many students reported that their memory for material was better after a\nPRS class than after other classes. This was consistent with the survey data [T2:S6]\nInteraction and discussion\nIn the focus groups, all students were convinced that discussion with other students in their\npeer groups played a central role in enhancing their understanding of concepts and ideas\n[T3:S1]. They maintained that peer discussion provided opportunities to think about the\nNumber Survey statement Students Students\nagree diasagree\n1.

Nicol Using classroom communication systems in large class settings\nproblem in more detail, to explore alternative viewpoints and problem-solving approaches\nand to ask for, hear and try to reconcile different explanations. In effect, peer discussion\nhelps students to elaborate and build upon their own personal framework of\nunderstanding. This finding is consistent with research from the United States (Dufresne et\nal, 1996; Crouch and Mazur, 2001).\nA significant number of students in the focus groups also talked about the value of peer\ndiscussion by referring to a form of 'scaffolding' by fellow learners (see Bruner, 1985).\nI think you can learn a lot easier from the people that are the same age as you . . . if\nthey've just grasped it then they can explain it in sort of easier terms than the lecturer\n. . . you suddenly understand it when a minute before it was difficult\nThe language used by other students was seen as a critical component in fostering this new\ninsight and understanding [T3: S2].\nIt's a language that you can understand between two students . . . whereas if its put\nforward by the professor he knows the deep meaning behind everything - he might\nmake it more complicated than it needs to be.\nIn the focus groups, students expressed mixed views regarding their experience of class-\nwide discussion and this was reflected in the survey where there was a mixed reaction to the\nstatement 'a class discussion using the microphone is an important aspect of the PRS class'\n[T3:S3]. On the positive side, many students said that hearing other explanations - for\ncorrect and incorrect answers - from those outside their own group helped them grasp\ndifficult concepts.\nYou are learning from people round you . . . maybe someone at the other side of the\nroom that understands a lot better than you, or the members of your group, and that\n[person] starts explaining it.\nAlso, over half the students reported that knowing that one might be called upon to\nexplain the thinking behind a response encouraged them to formulate explanations in\nadvance and that this increased attention levels during the class [T3:S4].\nDespite these benefits, there were drawbacks to class-wide discussion. Some students\nreported that class-wide discussion took up too much time and that it was easy to drift\naway from the question or get confused about the answers [T3:S5].\nThe answers to the problems can sometimes get lost during class discussion particularly\nwhen there are a number of potential answers being discussed. If the discussion goes on\nfor too long then interest can diminish it can also lead to confusion . . . it is easy to lose\ntrack of the main arguments.\nThe main recommendation made by students with regard to class-wide discussion and\nunanimously confirmed by the survey was that 'the tutor clearly explains which is the right\nanswer and why after a class discussion using the microphone' [T3:S6]:\nIt is important to get the final answer after having your own understanding and given\nyour own answer and had the class discussion . . . you've thought about it in so many\ndifferent ways and you've heard the logic of different answers . . . but which one is right?\n50\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 3\nStudent motivation\nDiscussing concept questions in class not only enhanced conceptual understanding but it\nalso proved to be a powerful motivating force. In Week 5 students were asked (critical\nincident question): At what moment in the class did you feel most engaged with what was\nhappening? Why? Over 90 per cent of the 100 students in class that day wrote that they\nwere most engaged when they were interacting and discussing problems with other\nstudents and teachers.\nStudents also reported enhanced engagement when they received histogram feedback.\nKnowing that other students also gave wrong answers to concept tests had the effect of\nincreasing their confidence [T4:S1] and their willingness to participate in peer and class-\nwide discussions.\nIt helps you to learn to stand up for yourself and argue your point of view . . . to be able\nto sit there and say that you are wrong is difficult for anybody but in there (the\ninteractive classroom) it is easier because there are 50 per cent that were wrong as well,\nso it makes it easier. When you know that other people don't understand it, it makes you\nfeel bet ter . . . in a lecture you wouldn't know that.\nNumber Survey statement\n1.

See comment under Table 2.\nTable 4: Student responses to end of semester survey\nSome students also reported in the focus groups that it was reinforcing during the peer\ninstruction sequence to see the class move from a situation where there was division about\nthe correct answer (at first concept test) to a situation where the majority had correct\nresponses (when retested).\nWhen more of the class gets a correct answer the second time round you feel that you\nare making progress . . . that is, if your view has changed and you are now correct. . .\nyou know you have understood it better than before but also you feel that you are\nkeeping pace with the class and that we're learning together\nThere was also consensus in the focus groups and survey that the varied structure of the\nteaching sessions with explanations, concept tests and discussion helped sustain students'\nattention in class [T4:S2].\nNot only did most students experience these classes as 'involving' but over 25 per cent\n51\nStudents\nagree\n65\n83\n98\n76\nStudents\ndiasagree\n8\n1\n0\n2\nJames T. Boyle and David]. Nicol Using classroom communication systems in large class settings\nwhen asked (critical incident question) in Week 5, 'What most surprised you about this\nclass?' wrote that they found the class enjoyable. This was confirmed by the survey [T4:S3]\nand by the fact that most students also thought that the PRS methods should be used in\nother classes [T4:S4].\nMotivation and conceptual understanding are closely related in the experience of students.\nIn the critical incident questionnaire students were asked: At what moment in the class did\nyou feel most distanced from what was happening? Why? Over 50 per cent wrote that they\nfelt most distanced when they did not understand something; for example, what other\nstudents were saying or the teacher's explanation of a concept. The survey data also show\nthat students believed that the methods used in this class 'help the teacher become more\naware of student difficulties with the subject matter' [T4:S5].\nResults: experiences of academic staff\nThis section reports on the teachers' experiences in the interactive classroom.\nConceptual understanding\nIn the focus group with academic staff, there was also consensus that these new teaching\nmethods were helping to improve the students' grasp of core engineering concepts. Two\nmain reasons were given. First, the structure of PRS sessions around questions and\nanswers provided benefits over conventional lectures; it made it possible for teachers to get\nimmediate feedback about student difficulties and to reflect on the effectiveness of\nteaching while it was in progress. This feedback also made it possible to adjust teaching to\nthe immediate needs of students.\nThe questioning process provides more feedback than traditional teaching methods. It\ngives you more information about where the students are coming from and you learn\nwhat misunderstandings or misconceptions they have and which ones can be easily\nstraightened out.\nHaving time to observe is quite powerful. Even when you are on your own using PRS\nyou have time to think - while students are discussing - about how things have gone and\nwhere you might go next with the teaching whereas in lecturing you are forced to keep\nthe flow and there is little time to reflect. It can be difficult to think on the spot in a\nlecture class.\nA second reason given for improved concept learning was related to changes in\npreparation. Instead of organizing a presentation, preparation now involved organizing\nshort inputs around key concepts and the devising of concept questions. The construction\nof effective questions was considered central to the success of these teaching methods.\nTeaching staff talked about trying to identify 'what it is about the subject matter that\nmakes it difficult for students' and about trying to formulate a concept question that would\nfocus on this difficulty. Different types of questions had been used in class: questions where\nstudents had to order items; factual questions where they had to select the best definition;\nquestions where they had to calculate something (for example, pressure under certain\nconditions) then select the answer; comparative questions (for example, if you input heat\ndoes the pressure go up, down or stay the same). One member of staff with more\nexperience of PRS talked about categorizing question types according to Bloom's\n52\nALT-J Volume 11 Number 3\ntaxonomy (1956) and about sequencing questions so that there was a move to increasing\nlevels of difficulty as the class progressed.\nIn order to create discussion amongst students, concept questions must produce a spread\nof responses. Teachers reported that if the pattern of correct responses was between 40 and\n60 per cent this would normally provide a good trigger for discussion. Some teachers noted\nthat it was sometimes difficult to produce an appropriate range of answers so that students\ncould not merely select the correct answer through a process of elimination. Others noted\nthat in some circumstances the thought processes required for logical elimination were\nthemselves worth testing.\nTo date, the department has not analysed students' responses to questions from the logs\nthat were available on the computer. The teachers agreed that these logs would provide\nuseful information about the effectiveness of certain questions and that they could be used\nto develop a systematic database of areas of student difficulty with concepts. However,\ntaking notes during class and keeping a teaching diary were seen as positive alternatives to\nlog analysis because these processes encouraged reflection during teaching rather than\nmuch later.\nWhile recognizing the value of these technology-supported discussion methods for concept\nlearning, the focus group also helped clarify one potential limitation of these methods,\nnamely, that they 'only tackle bites of knowledge but that the integration of lots of bites is\nalso important' (see discussion section). Another issue discussed was whether teachers\ncould 'cover as much material' in class using these methods. Most teachers maintained that\nteaching around concepts might either reduce or increase input but that this depended on\nhow students responded to concept tests. From this perspective, these methods were seen as\na more efficient way of teaching.\nInteraction and discussion\nThere was consensus in the focus groups that peer discussion was central to these new\nteaching methods because of the way it engaged students actively in learning:\nStudents in this mode are reinforcing their own learning by actively reflecting on and\narticulating their own learning processes without them even knowing.\nIt was also agreed that peer discussion was an effective way of acclimatizing students to the\nspecialized language of the discipline: ,\nIf you get questions and then peer discussion then students learn to use similar words to\nthose the teacher uses to describe problems. The peer discussion also acts as a bridge\nenabling students to translate our words into their own words.\nHowever, some members of the focus group noted that the more abstract the subject\nmatter the more difficult it was for the students to engage in peer discussion:\nIn mathematics the concepts are so fundamental and there is a need to test each little bit\nbut it is difficult to get meaningful discussion around very small bits\nOthers argued that problems in mathematics often revolve around considerations of the\ncorrect (mathematical) processes to be used and that the peer discussion could usefully\nfocus on this. There is clearly scope for further research in such abstract disciplines.\nS3\nJames T. Boyle and David j. Nicol Using classroom communication systems in large class settings\nThere were mixed views in the focus group about the value of class-wide discussion. It was\nnoted that not everyone had the skills to manage large class discussions effectively and that\nit was time-consuming to implement.\nWhen you do identify a spread of questions I feel I want to get into deeper dialogue\nthrough class discussion but class discussion takes up too much time.\nOthers remarked that if you ask for volunteers to contribute during class-wide discussion\noften the same students responded.\nDespite these difficulties, most teachers reported that class-wide discussion had some\nadvantages over peer discussion. In class-wide discussion, teachers can hear what the\nstudents think and this feedback is essential if they are to learn about areas of conceptual\ndifficulty.\nThe focus group went on to identify a number of scenarios when it would be worthwhile\nusing class-wide discussion despite the time considerations; (i) to find out why students got\nthe wrong answer; (ii) to check students' interpretations of a question the first time you\nused it (for example, whether the wording was confusing); (iii) to find out what\nassumptions students were making in formulating answers.\nStudent motivation\nAll teachers maintained that these discussion methods are motivational in comparison\nwith conventional lecturing. They talked about how using PRS raised the activity level in\nclass, animated the students and kept them interested. It was also noted that attendance\nwas always over 80 per cent in PRS classes and this was in spite of the fact that each class\nlasts two hours rather than the normal hour (total contact time was the same as other\nclasses). In other lecture classes, the numbers normally drop off significantly as the\nsemester progresses.\nThe teachers also believed that when students receive feedback information through the\nhistogram display it has a motivational effect.\nIt gives students reassurance that they are not the only one who is wrong and makes the\nstudent feel more comfortable about admitting to his peers that she\/he does not\nunderstand the concept\nDiscussion\nIn this final section we highlight some practical and research issues relevant to those who\nmight wish to implement the interactive methods described in this paper.\nThe first issue is the added value provided by classroom communication technology. What\ndoes this technology provide over and above what could be achieved in more conventional\nclass settings? The unique contribution of the technology is in the quality of feedback that\nit enables. Regardless of class size both teacher and students get almost instantaneous\nfeedback about the distribution of student responses to a concept test in a situation where\nthe respondents do not know what choices others are making. It would be extremely\ndifficult to provide this kind of feedback in a large class by any other means (for example, a\nshow of hands). In addition, students can quickly see how their personal response relates\nto the total distribution. This not only allows students to track their own progress in\n54\nALT-J Volume 11 Number 3\nunderstanding relative to others in class but it also allows teachers to identify when\nstudents are encountering conceptual difficulties and to adapt their instruction in response.\nIn many educational models, adaptive behaviour of this kind is seen as an essential\ncomponent of good teaching (for example, Laurillard, 1993).\nA second issue concerns the effectiveness of the different discussion methods. This\nevaluation has shown that classroom technology can support active discussion learning.\nHowever, it has also shown that peer discussion and class-wide discussion have different\nstrengths. Peer discussion is superior to class-wide discussion if the goal is to increase the\namount of interaction. The smaller numbers in the peer groups make it easier for all\nstudents to participate in discussion and students report that this method is less\nthreatening than class-wide discussion. From this viewpoint, a key strength of peer\ndiscussion is that students are encouraged to construct and co-construct their\nunderstandings of core concepts in negotiation with others (Boyle and Nicol, 2003). In\ncontrast, the main strength of class-wide discussion is that the teacher gains greater insight\ninto why students misunderstand or misapply concepts. This is a result of the public nature\nof the discussion. This feedback is essential if teachers are to learn from their teaching and\nto teach more effectively in future (Laurillard, 1993). Yet, class-wide discussion is more\ndifficult for teachers to manage, is more time-consuming and it can lead to student\nconfusion. This comparison of the two discussion methods has not been researched until\nnow despite its importance. At minimum, it suggests that teachers must think carefully\nabout their reasons for implementing each discussion method. It also highlights the\nimportance of pedagogical (and task) design when planning for the use of learning\ntechnologies (Mayes, 2001).\nOther issues of concern are the integration of concepts and the time required to realign\nteaching in relation to the discussion format. Teachers in this study felt that there was a\ndanger that concept tests might result in student learning being overly focused on small\n'bites' of information and that there was a need to test understanding not just of concepts\nbut of their relationships. The idea that concept tests be planned as a sequence might go\nsome way towards resolving this difficulty, as might the practice of constructing concept\ntests at different levels of granularity. Teachers also reported that test construction was not\nonly time-consuming and complex but that it also involved trial and error learning in class\nto discover which concept tests were most effective. Hence, those new to these teaching\nmethods will need to allocate time to build up a robust bank of effective test questions.\nA final issue concerns the role of students in these discussion methods. It has been argued\nthat these methods are student-centred in that they encourage active learning and\nreflection (Defresne et at, 1996). Yet both discussion sequences are normally triggered by\nquestions formulated by teachers rather than by students. Therefore, it could equally be\nargued that these methods are, in some respects at least, teacher-driven. While this might\nbe appropriate with first-year students there might be a need to shift the balance when\ndealing with students in their later years of study. One way to achieve this might be to\ninvolve students more actively in decisions about concept tests. Even using the PRS to ask\nquestions such as 'do you want more on this topic?' during class, might help shift the\nbalance in the students' direction. However, a more effective strategy would be to have\nstudents themselves (for example, in pairs) construct multiple-choice concept tests that\ncould be used in class to challenge the learning of their peers. This strategy has been shown\n55\nJames T. Boyle and David J.
