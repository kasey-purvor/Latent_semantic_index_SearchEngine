Fourteen typical computer-related\ntasks (e.g., copy, move) were viewed by 60 school-children in two iconic formats:\nanimated and static. The content of the icons and the computer process or action they\nmimicked were drawn from a previous study in which a similar group of children was\nasked to depict gesturally their interpretation of the 14 tasks. Results indicated that the\nanimated version of the icons was more recognizable and that the children greatly\npreferred the animated icons over the static icons. Implications for the design of\nenhanced user-interfaces for children are noted.\nIntroduction\nTwo advancements in the microcomputer industry - direct-manipulation user interface\n(DMUI) and multimedia - have opened the door for the provision of enhanced computer\ninteraction. The former has received a great deal of attention and has resulted in a\nproliferation of such interfaces running on many different platforms. The latter is also causing\na stir in the industry and promises to allow for the integration and manipulation of text,\ngraphics and sounds (voice and music).\nFrom the perspective of a direct-manipulation interface, however, children in educational\nsettings have benefited little from these advancements. Presently, they have access to\nmicrocomputers which have been designed for general-purpose and adult use (IBM, Apple II\nseries, Apple Macintosh, Amiga). Some work has been carried out by the designers of the\nOntario Government-supported microcomputer (ICON), a system targeted solely for\neducational use (McLean, 1983) and by researchers at the Children's Television Workshop\n(Strommen, 1990), but there still exists a wide gap between the features of existing interfaces\n40\nALTJ VOLUME 1 NUMBER 1\nand features which reflect a sensitivity to developmental change. The expectation is that\nchildren will be able to interpret and to make productive and efficient use of an interface that\nwas designed for another class of users, i.e. adults. In the classroom, children are provided\nwith 'out-of-package' software (MacWrite, PCPaint or the like) and the assumption is made\nthat either that the children will intuit how many of the functions of these programs are\naccessed and executed or that they will become productive users after some minimal\ninstruction. Given that there are great differences - both qualitative and quantitative - between\nchildren and adults, it follows that the nature of child-computer interaction will be quite\ndifferent from adult-computer interaction and that a starting point for a closer look at\nchild-computer interaction might be the features inherent in the DMUI.\nTo investigate one of these features, I carried out a study1 which focused on the\nrecognizability of and preference for animated icons by young children. Building on previous\nwork which attempted to determine the pictorial content of the icons (Jones, 1990),\nelementary-aged school children were asked to describe what computer-related action or\nmessage was being depicted by a moving image (animated icon) or by a static image, and to\nindicate which of the two formats they preferred. Results are reported here, together with a\ndiscussion of future directions.\nAnimated icons\nGiven that graphical icons (as part of a more general metaphor) comprise one half of a\ndirect-manipulation interface (Gittins, 1986), one might ask: What should constitute the\nfeatures of these icons with which children will interact in a 'seeing and pointing' - i.e.\ndirect-manipulation - interface? Townsend (1986) recommends that icons which are designed\nfor use by children should \"clearly depict, indicate and distinguish a program's commands\nand operations\" and \"should suggest and indicate a command intention rather than just\nduplicate or represent a particular pictorial form.\" The goal of educational software\ndevelopers, then, is to incorporate icons which are realistic and meaningful for children and\nwhich leave little room for misinterpretation. For the most part, the iconic component in\nexisting interfaces for children's use merely mirrors what is available in the commercial\nmarketplace and does not respond to the developmental world of the child.\nOne possibility is to consider the utility of animated icons as a feature in a DMUI. A similar\napproach has been successfully used in the area of pre-reading - Bridge Reading program\n(Dewsbury, 1983) - in which the instructor employs sounds, lpgogiaphs (drawings) and\nphysical gestures to teach young children how to read. In this program, the physical gestures\nby both instructors and students are viewed as a temporary event in the instructional process\nand are meant, at the outset, to provide additional cues to the beginning reader. Eventually the\ngestures are dropped as the child moves toward a word-recognition capability. The gestural\ncomponent, which is heavily used at the outset of the instruction, is considered pivotal in that\nthe instructional process is, at that beginning stage, drawing on the child's knowledge of\ncommonplace movements. Thus, the children are exposed to not only a static series of letters\nin a book or on a card, but also are provided with additional information by means of the\naccompanying gesture.\nIn a previous study (Jones, 1990), an attempt was made to determine how children would\nindicate to a second party by gesture their notion of computer tasks or operations (e.g. cut,\n41\nTom Jones Animated icons and elementary-aged children\nmove, copy). The 14 operations selected involved actions and were provided to the subjects\nduring the experiment as verbs (Table 1). The goal was to solicit from the population of\ninterest their ideas on how best to indicate overtly (but without words) these actions, and to\nuse this information in the design of the content of the computer icons. During a 40-minute\ntesting session, 40 children (6, 8 and 10 year-olds) were asked to put themselves in a situation\nin which they could see a friend but could not verbally communicate\nwith that friend. The subjects were asked to look at a drawing of a\nchild who was standing behind, a window and to move their hands or\nbody in such a way as to communicate to the friend behind the\nwindow what it was that they wanted the friend to do. For example, in\norder to indicate to the friend that the subject wanted something\nmoved, the majority of the subjects moved their two hands in tandem\nfrom left to right or right to left in an arc-like fashion.\nTask\n1. put away\n2. get\n3. send\n4. open\n5. close\n6. write\n7. draw\n8. point\n9. move\n10. erase\n11. drag\n12. copy\n13. cut\n14. paste\nTable 1: Operators\npresented to three\nage groups\nAlthough there was disparity across age levels for some of the 14\ntasks, the content of the responses and the percentage of subjects who\nexhibited similar responses resulted in obvious trends. To produce\nanimated icons for testing, each operator in Table 1 for each of the\nthree age levels was scripted in a storyboard fashion; a model posed\nfor each step in the scripts and these steps were then digitized using a\nvideo camera and a screen-capture program (MacVision). Each image\nwas subsequently cleaned up or 'outlined' and the images or steps\nwere then cut and pasted to an animation program (VideoWorks II) as\ncast-members, and assembled into an animated icon. One example of\nthese animated icons is presented in Figure 1.\nIn order to determine if the icon content generated during the previous\nstudy (Jones, 1990) had the same connotation for other children of the\nsame age, the icons were presented to a similar sample of\nelementary-aged students in two formats: animated and static. The\ngoals were two-fold:\n\u2022 to see if these children attributed the same meaning to - i.e.\nrecognized - the actions generated by the previous subjects\n# to solicit from them their preference as to an animated or\nstatic version of the icon for the computer task.\nMethod\nSubjects\nSixty children from an elementary school in Calgary (20 from each of three age groups - 6, 8\nand 10) were tested. There were an equal number of males and females. The primary criterion\nfor subject selection was that the child had not previously used a Macintosh computer or a,\ncomputer with a similar interface.\n42\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 1\nProcedure\nEach subject was tested in two phases. For the first phase, the subjects were randomly\nassigned to the animated or static icon condition and were asked to describe the' action that\nthey saw depicted on the monitor for all 14 computer-like tasks. For the second phase, they\nwere told what each of the 14 icons (animated or static) stood for, and were then asked which\nof the two formats they preferred. For both phases, the 14 items were randomly presented to\nthe subjects.\nAnalysis\nFrequency counts were carried out for both experimental phases and chi-square tests were run.\ntttk\nFigure 1: Example of an animated sequence for 'draw'\nResults\nFor the first phase of the testing (\"What does this picture [animated or static] mean?\"), the\nresults are contained in Table 2.\nFor 13 of the 14 computer tasks listed in Table 2, the percentage of subjects who were asked\nto describe the computer task depicted by the animated icons was higher than those who were\nexposed to the static icon condition. However, in many instances, the spread between the two\npercentage scores was not high. For four of the animated tasks and six of the static tasks, less\nthan 50% of the subjects correctly indicated the action involved. This is not surprising given\nthat the subjects in this study were simply asked to state in one or two words what the moving\nor static drawing on the computer screen represented; that is, they were not provided a context\nin which to respond.\nAnalysis of the age and gender factors did not result in marked differences. The sex-by-animated-\nicon analysis showed no differences, while the age-by-animated-icon results indicated that there\nwere differences for the 'draw' and 'copy' tasks. For the former, the 8 and 10 year-olds correctly\n43\nTom Jones Animated icons and elementary-aged children\nOperation\n1. put away\n2. get\n3. send\n4. open\n5. close\n6. write\n7. draw\n8. point\n9. move\n10. erase\n11. drag\n12. copy\n13. cut\n14. paste\nAnimated\n16.7\n3.3\n66.7\n43.3\n20.0\n96.7\n83.3\n80.0\n70.0\n40.0\n60.0\n83.7\n80.0\n63.7\nStatic\n6.7\n6.7\n60.0\n30.0\n16.7\n90.0\n60.0\n76.7\n20.0\n20.0\n56.7\n76.7\n66.7\n63.3\nOperation\n1. put away\n2. get\n3. send\n4. open\n5. close\n6. write\n7. draw\n8. point\n9. move\n10. erase\n11. drag\n12. copy\n13. cut\n14. paste\nAnimated\n75.0\n65.0\n81.7\n51.7\n51.7\n78.3\n78.3\n51.7\n85.0\n91.7\n76.7\n70.0\n86.7\n78.3\nStatic\n25.0\n35.0\n18.3\n48.3\n48.3\n21.7\n21.7\n48.3\n15.0\n8.3\n23.3\n30.0\n13.3\n21.7\nTable 2: Correct response for animated\nversus static condition (%)\nTable 3: Preferences for icon format (%)\nidentified the animated 'draw' icon more often than the 6 year-olds (x (2,N=60) = 6.24, p <.O5)\nand the same result held for the animated 'copy' icon (x^ (2,N=60) = 12.0, p <.O5). With respect\nto the static icons, the age-by-static-icon analysis showed no differences, while the sex-by-static-\nicon comparison showed the male subjects incorrectly identified the 'open' icon more often than\nthe female subjects (y~ (l,N=60) = 14.36, p <.O5). The results for which format the subjects\npreferred were more clear-cut. In each instance, more than 50% of the subjects selected the ani-\nmated icon as the one which best captured the designated action. Table 3 lists the results across all\nsubjects.\nWhat should be noted here is that, for this treatment, the subjects were aware of what each\nicon stood for in that the stimulus consisted of the animated icon, the static icon, and the\noperator word which described the action. The subjects were asked to pick the icon format\n(animated or static) which they thought best described the operation.\nConclusion\nIt appears that the use of animated icons as a feature in a child-computer interface has merit.\nIn addition to the fact that children are better able to decipher the meaning of animated icons\nover static icons, they also show a marked preference for the moving icons. Given that one of\nthe tenets of a DMUI is that the user should spend less time processing (and eventually\n44\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 1\ndeciding) what a system's options are, if the system itself is to be transparent to the user\n(Shneiderman, 1987), then the incorporation of animated icons which provide children with\nmeaningful information should be seriously considered. This would fit with the goal of\ndesigning an interface for children which puts as little demand as possible on their short-term\nor working memory.\nNot surprisingly, there were no age or sex differences for either of the two icon formats or for\nthe preferences. What warrants further study is the content (animated or otherwise) of the icon\nitself. With respect to the results reported here, a number of the icons presented a problem to\nall three age groups in that the icons either did not contain enough information or contained\nambiguous information and, as a result, were not correctly identified by the majority of the\nsubjects. The reasons for this might range from a simple mis-reading by the subjects, to the\ngap between the pictorial content of the icon and the lack of an overall context - or, in DMUI\nterms, the metaphor - in which the recognition task was presented. The more-encompassing\nmatter of a metaphor for classroom use is deserving of more detailed analysis.\nA possible next step is to generate a series of prototypical interfaces for children and to test\nthem for effectiveness and for children's reactions to them. A number of questions should be\naddressed:\n\u2022 What other features should be built into an interface designed for use by children?\n\u2022 If animated icons are an effective way to provide information to children about the\nfunctionalities of a system, how might the child proceed once the animated icon is\nselected? Would the child select the object upon which he or she wishes to carry out\nsome operation first, and then select the animated icon which represents the desired\noperation, or vice-versa?\n\u2022 How many levels of options should be made available to the child? Should the\nsystem or application program contain options that can be crossed with each and\nevery other option, or should there be some measure of a hierarchical structure?\nAll of these questions (and many others) call for a comprehensive analysis of generalizable\ninterface for child-computer interaction. It seems only fair that if children in schools are going\nto be using these technologies for learning, and if large expenditures are going to be required\nto provide these tools, a rigorous and child-centred approach must be taken to the design and\nimplementation of this interface.\nNote\n1.
