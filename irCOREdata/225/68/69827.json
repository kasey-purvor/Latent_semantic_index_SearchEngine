In particular he proved that the ideal of compact operators is the only non-trivial,\nclosed ideal in B(`2). For each non-separable Hilbert space H, Gramsch and Luft have\nindependently described all the closed ideals inB(H) and shown that they are well-ordered\nby inclusion (see [16] and [25], respectively \u0016 or [28, \u009f5.4] for a short account).\nAnother famous extension of Calkin's result is as follows.\n1.1 Theorem. (Gohberg, Markus, and Feldman [12]) For E = `p, where 1 6 p <\u221e, and\nE = c0, the ideal of compact operators is the only non-trivial, closed ideal in B(E). 2\nA surprising fact that testifies to our limited understanding of Banach algebras of the\nform B(E) for a Banach space E is that, to our knowledge, the above-mentioned examples\nare hitherto the only infinite-dimensional Banach spaces E for which the lattice of closed\nideals in B(E) is completely understood. The main purpose of this paper is to add a new\nmember to this family. More precisely, we shall prove that, for the Banach space\nE :=\n(\u2295\n`n2\n)\nc0\n(1.1)\n(that is, E is the c0-direct sum of the finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces `\n1\n2, `\n2\n2, . . . , `\nn\n2 , . . .),\nthere are precisely two non-trivial, closed ideals in B(E), namely the ideal of compact\noperators and the closure of the ideal of operators that factor through c0. This theorem is\nestablished through `salami tactics' \u0016 we begin with some fairly general results and then\ngradually specialize until in Section 5 we consider the particular space E given by (1.1).\nEven though Banach spaces E for which the lattice of closed ideals in B(E) is com-\npletely understood are rare, quite a few partial results are known. We shall now briefly\nreview some of these.\nFirst, Volkmann has proved that, whenever p, q \u2208 [1,\u221e[ are distinct, there are exactly\ntwo maximal ideals in B(`p\u2295 `q), they are generated by the operators that factor through\n`p and `q, respectively, and their intersection is the ideal of strictly singular operators\n(see [30] or [28, Theorem 5.3.2]). A similar result holds if either `p or `q is replaced with c0.\nSecond, building on work of Rosenthal and Schechtman, Pietsch has demonstrated that\nthere are infinitely many closed ideals in B\n(\nLp[0, 1]\n)\nfor each p \u2208 ]1,\u221e[ \\ {2}. Moreover,\nPietsch has shown that there are uncountably many closed ideals in B\n(\nC[0, 1]\n)\n(see [28,\nTheorems 5.3.9 and 5.3.11]).\nThird, Edelstein and Mityagin observed in [11, p. 225] that the ideal of weakly compact\noperators is a maximal ideal of codimension one in B(J), where J denotes James's quasi-\nreflexive Banach space introduced in [18]. Laustsen has proved that this maximal ideal is\n2\nthe only maximal ideal inB(J), and applied this result to construct Banach spaces E such\nthat B(E) has any specified finite number of maximal ideals of any specified codimensions\n(see [23]).\nFourth, while solving the unconditional basic sequence problem, Gowers and Maurey\nconstructed the first example of a hereditarily indecomposable Banach space, and showed\nthat the ideal S (E) of strictly singular operators is a maximal ideal of codimension one in\nB(E) for each such space E (see [14]); once again this maximal ideal is unique (see [23]).\nAndroulakis and Schlumprecht have proved that non-compact, strictly singular operators\nexist on the particular hereditarily indecomposable Banach space E that Gowers and Mau-\nrey constructed (see [1]), and so in this case S (E) is not the only non-trivial, closed ideal\nin B(E). It is a major open problem whether or not there exists a Banach space E such\nthat the ideal of compact operators is a maximal ideal of codimension one in B(E). The\nreader is referred to Schlumprecht's paper [29] for the current state of this difficult problem\ntogether with an impressive new method of attack.\nFifth, Mankiewicz on the one hand and Dales, Loy, and Willis on the other have found\nBanach spaces E such that `\u221e is a quotient of B(E) (see [26] and [8], respectively).\nIt follows that, for each of these spaces E, B(E) has at least 22\n\u21350 maximal ideals of\ncodimension one. Later, when solving Banach's hyperplane problem, Gowers constructed\na Banach space G such that `\u221e\/c0 is a quotient of B(G) (see [13] and [15]). Laustsen has\nclassified the maximal ideals in B(G) by observing that each such ideal is the preimage of\na maximal ideal in `\u221e\/c0 (see [23]).\nWe shall next explain how this paper is organized.\nSection 2 contains the formal definitions of the direct sums of Banach spaces that we\nshall be concerned with, together with those of their basic properties that we require.\nIn Section 3 we modify the techniques known from the proof of Theorem 1.1 to show\nthat, for certain Banach spaces E, the ideals of approximable, compact, strictly singular,\nand inessential operators inB(E) coincide, and that there is a unique minimal closed ideal\nin B(E) properly containing these ideals. This result applies in particular to each Banach\nspace E that is a c0- or `p-direct sum of a sequence of finite-dimensional spaces.\nIn Section 4 we consider the case where E is the c0-direct sum of some sequence of\nBanach spaces, and determine conditions that ensure that the closed ideal G c0(E) generated\nby the operators on E that factor through c0 is a maximal ideal in B(E).\nSection 5 contains our main result: for the Banach space E defined in (1.1), above, the\nideal of compact operatorsK (E) and the ideal G c0(E) just defined are the only non-trivial,\nclosed ideals in B(E).\nIn our final section, Section 6, we apply this result to give a new proof of the theo-\nrem, due to Bourgain, Casazza, Lindenstrauss, and Tzafriri, that each infinite-dimensional,\ncomplemented subspace of the Banach space E given by (1.1) is either isomorphic to c0 or\nto E.\nBefore ending this introduction, let us describe some notation and conventions that we\nrely on throughout the paper.\nAll Banach spaces are supposed to be over the same scalar field K, where K = R\n3\nor K = C. For a Banach space E, we denote by E \u2032 the dual Banach space of E, we\nwrite \u3008\u00b7 , \u00b7\u3009 for the duality between E and E \u2032, and we denote by \u03baE the canonical embedding\nof E into its bidual Banach space E \u2032\u2032.\nA bounded, linear map between Banach spaces is termed an operator. The collection\nof all operators from a Banach space E to a Banach space F is denoted by B(E,F ), or\njust B(E) in the case where E = F . We write IE for the identity operator on E.\nAn operator ideal is an assignment J which associates to each pair (E,F ) of Banach\nspaces a linear subspace J (E,F ) of B(E,F ) satisfying:\n(i) J (E,F ) is non-zero for some Banach spaces E and F ;\n(ii) for any Banach spaces D, E, F , and G, the composite operator TSR belongs to\nJ (D,G) whenever R belongs to B(D,E), S to J (E,F ), and T to B(F,G).\nWe usually write J (E) instead of J (E,E).\nFor an operator idealJ and Banach spaces E and F , we writeJ (E,F ) for the closure\n(in the operator norm) of J (E,F ) in B(E,F ). The assignment J thus defined is an\noperator ideal, called the closure of J . We say that the operator ideal J is closed if\nJ =J .\nWe shall consider the following operator ideals (and their closures):\n\u0015 F, the finite-rank operators (the operators in F are termed approximable);\n\u0015 K , the compact operators;\n\u0015 S, the strictly singular operators;\n\u0015 E, the inessential operators;\n\u0015 I\u221e, the \u221e-integral operators;\n\u0015 GC (where C is a subset of B(E,F ) for some Banach spaces E and F ), the operator\nideal generated by the set C.\nWe regard the first two of these operator ideals as so well-known that no definitions are\nrequired. We shall define the final four when they first appear in the text.\n2 Preliminaries on direct sums\n2.1 Finite direct sums. Let n \u2208 N, and let E1, . . . , En be Banach spaces. We denote by\nE1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 En the direct sum of E1, . . . , En equipped with the `n\u221e-norm given by\u2225\u2225(x1, . . . , xn)\u2225\u2225 := max{\u2016x1\u2016, . . . , \u2016xn\u2016} (x1 \u2208 E1, . . . , xn \u2208 En). (2.1)\n(This particular choice of norm on the direct sum will be important in Section 5.) In the\ncase where E1 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = En, we write E\u2295n1 instead of E1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 En.\nSet E := E1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 En. For each m \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, we write JEm for the canonical\nembedding of Em into E and Q\nE\nm for the canonical projection of E onto Em. When no\nambiguity may arise, we omit the superscript E from these operators.\n4\nSuppose that T1 : E1 \u2192 F1, . . . , Tn : En \u2192 Fn are operators into some Banach spaces\nF1, . . . , Fn. Then we write T1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Tn for the diagonal operator induced by T1, . . . , Tn,\nthat is,\nT1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Tn : (x1, . . . , xn) 7\u2192 (T1x1, . . . , Tnxn), E1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 En \u2192 F1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Fn.\n2.2 The D-direct sum of an infinite sequence of Banach spaces. Let D be a\nBanach space with a normalized, 1-unconditional basis (dn). The (D, (dn))-direct sum of\na sequence (En) of Banach spaces is given by(\u2295\nn\u2208N\nEn\n)\nD, (dn)\n:=\n{\n(xn)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 xn \u2208 En (n \u2208 N) and the series \u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u2016xn\u2016 dn converges\n}\n.\nThis is a Banach space for coordinatewise defined addition and scalar multiplication and\nnorm given by\u2225\u2225(xn)\u2225\u2225 := \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u2016xn\u2016 dn\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2208 [0,\u221e[\n(\n(xn) \u2208\n(\u2295\nn\u2208N\nEn\n)\nD, (dn)\n)\n.\nWe shall usually suppress the index set N in this notation. Moreover, in most cases D\ncomes with a `canonical' basis (dn), and so we may without ambiguity omit (dn), thus\nwriting\n(\u2295\nEn\n)\nD\ninstead of\n(\u2295\nn\u2208NEn\n)\nD, (dn)\n.\nSet E :=\n(\u2295\nEn\n)\nD\n. As in the finite case (see \u009f2.1), we denote by JEm the canonical\nembedding of Em into E and by Q\nE\nm the canonical projection of E onto Em for each m \u2208 N.\nBoth JEm and Q\nE\nm are operators of norm one; in fact, the former is an isometry, and the\nlatter is a quotient map. Let \u03bd be a non-empty subset of N. Since the basis (dn) is\n1-unconditional, there is an idempotent operator PE\u03bd of norm one given by\nPE\u03bd : x 7\u2192\n\u2211\nm\u2208\u03bd\nJEmQ\nE\nmx, E \u2192 E.\n2.3 Duality. Let D be a Banach space with a normalized, 1-unconditional basis (dn),\nlet (En) be a sequence of Banach spaces, and set E :=\n(\u2295\nEn\n)\nD\n. Suppose that the\nbasis (dn) is shrinking, so that the coordinate functionals (d\n\u2032\nn) are a normalized, 1-uncon-\nditional basis of the dual space D\u2032. Then we can form the D\u2032-direct sum E\u2020 :=\n(\u2295\nE \u2032n\n)\nD\u2032 ,\nand it can be shown that the map \u03a5E : E\n\u2020 \u2192 E \u2032 given by\u2329\n(xn),\u03a5E(\u03d5n)\n\u232a\n:=\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u3008xn, \u03d5n\u3009\n(\n(xn) \u2208 E, (\u03d5n) \u2208 E\u2020\n)\nis an isometric isomorphism making the diagrams\nE \u2032n\n(QEn )\n\u2032\n\/\/\nJE\n\u2020\nn \u001c\u001c9\n99\n99\n99\n99\nE \u2032 E \u2032\n(JEn )\n\u2032\n\/\/ E \u2032n\nand\nE\u2020\n\u03a5E\nBB\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\nE\u2020\n\u03a5E\n\\\\888888888 QE\n\u2020\nn\nBB\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\ncommutative (e.g., see [22, \u009f4]).\n5\n2.4 Example. Let D = c0 or D = `p for some p \u2208 [1,\u221e[. We shall always equip D with\nits standard basis (dn) given by dn = (\u03b4m,n)\u221em=1 for each n \u2208 N, where \u03b4m,n is Kronecker's\ndelta symbol. It is well known that (dn) is a normalized, 1-unconditional basis of D and,\nmoreover, that (dn) is a shrinking basis for D = c0 and D = `p with p \u2208 ]1,\u221e[, but not\nfor D = `1.\nNow let (En) be a sequence of Banach spaces. Then we have(\u2295\nEn\n)\nc0\n=\n{\n(xn)\n\u2223\u2223 xn \u2208 En (n \u2208 N) and \u2016xn\u2016 \u2192 0 as n\u2192\u221e},\nand\n\u2225\u2225(xn)\u2225\u2225 = sup{\u2016xn\u2016 \u2223\u2223 n \u2208 N} for each (xn) \u2208 (\u2295En)c0 . Similarly, for each p \u2208 [1,\u221e[,\nwe have (\u2295\nEn\n)\n`p\n=\n{\n(xn)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 xn \u2208 En (n \u2208 N) and \u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u2016xn\u2016p <\u221e\n}\n,\nand\n\u2225\u2225(xn)\u2225\u2225 = (\u2211\u221en=1 \u2016xn\u2016p)1\/p for each (xn) \u2208 (\u2295En)`p .\n2.5 Diagonal operators. Let D be a Banach space with a normalized, 1-unconditional\nbasis (dn), and, for each n \u2208 N, let Tn : En \u2192 Fn be an operator between Banach spaces En\nand Fn. Suppose that sup \u2016Tn\u2016 <\u221e. Then, as in the finite case, we can define the diagonal\noperator\ndiag(Tn) : (xn) 7\u2192 (Tnxn),\n(\u2295\nEn\n)\nD\n\u2192\n(\u2295\nFn\n)\nD\n.\nClearly, we have\n\u2225\u2225diag(Tn)\u2225\u2225 = sup \u2016Tn\u2016.\n2.6 Definition. Let D be a Banach space with a normalized, 1-unconditional basis, let\n(En) and (Fn) be sequences of Banach spaces, and let T :\n(\u2295\nEn\n)\nD\n\u2192 (\u2295Fn)D be an\noperator. We associate with T the infinite matrix (Tm,n), where\nTm,n := Q\nF\nmTJ\nE\nn : En \u2192 Fm (m,n \u2208 N).\nThe support of the mth row of T is\nrowsuppm(T ) :=\n{\nn \u2208 N \u2223\u2223 Tm,n 6= 0} (m \u2208 N).\nWe say that T has finite rows if each row has finite support, and we say that T has\nconsecutively supported rows if sup\n(\nrowsuppm(T )\n)\n< inf\n(\nrowsuppn(T )\n)\nwheneverm,n \u2208 N\nwith m < n (where we rely on the conventions that sup \u2205 = \u2212\u221e and inf \u2205 = +\u221e).\nSimilarly, the support of the nth column of T is\ncolsuppn(T ) :=\n{\nm \u2208 N \u2223\u2223 Tm,n 6= 0} (n \u2208 N),\nT has finite columns if each column has finite support, and T has consecutively supported\ncolumns if sup\n(\ncolsuppm(T )\n)\n< inf\n(\ncolsuppn(T )\n)\nwhenever m,n \u2208 N with m < n.\nIf T has both finite rows and finite columns, then we say that T has locally finite matrix.\n6\n2.7 Lemma. Let D be a Banach space with a normalized, 1-unconditional basis (dn),\nlet (En) and (Fn) be sequences of Banach spaces, set E :=\n(\u2295\nEn\n)\nD\nand F :=\n(\u2295\nFn\n)\nD\n,\nlet T : E \u2192 F be an operator, and let \u03b5 > 0.\n(i) Suppose that each of the spaces En (n \u2208 N) is finite-dimensional. Then there is an\napproximable operator S : E \u2192 F with \u2016S\u2016 6 \u03b5 such that T \u2212 S has finite columns,\nand Sm,n = Tm,n whenever Sm,n 6= 0 (m,n \u2208 N).\n(ii) Suppose that the basis (dn) is shrinking and that each of the spaces Fn (n \u2208 N) is\nfinite-dimensional. Then there is an approximable operator S : E \u2192 F with \u2016S\u2016 6 \u03b5\nsuch that T \u2212 S has finite rows, and Sm,n = Tm,n whenever Sm,n 6= 0 (m,n \u2208 N).\n(iii) Suppose that the basis (dn) is shrinking and that each of the spaces En and Fn (n \u2208 N)\nis finite-dimensional. Then there is an approximable operator S : E \u2192 F with \u2016S\u2016 6 \u03b5\nsuch that T \u2212 S has locally finite matrix, and Sm,n = Tm,n whenever Sm,n 6= 0\n(m,n \u2208 N).\nProof. For each M \u2208 N, set P\u02dcEM := PE{1,...,M} and P\u02dc FM := P F{1,...,M}.\n(i) Using the compactness of the unit ball of En (n \u2208 N), we can construct a strictly\nincreasing sequence (Mn) in N such that\u2225\u2225(IF \u2212 P\u02dc FMn)TJEn \u2225\u2225 6 \u03b5\/2n (n \u2208 N). (2.2)\nSet\nS :=\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n(IF \u2212 P\u02dc FMn)TJEn QEn : E \u2192 F.\nThen S is an approximable operator with \u2016S\u2016 6 \u03b5, and we have\nSm,n =\n{\n0 for m 6Mn\nTm,n for m > Mn\n(m,n \u2208 N).\nThis proves (i).\n(ii) Dualizing (2.2) (cf. \u009f2.3), we obtain a strictly increasing sequence (Mn) in N such\nthat \u2225\u2225QFnT (IE \u2212 P\u02dcEMn)\u2225\u2225 6 \u03b5\/2n (n \u2208 N).\nSet\nS :=\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nJFn Q\nF\nnT (IE \u2212 P\u02dcEMn) : E \u2192 F.\nAs before, it is easy to see that S has the properties listed in (ii).\n(iii) This is immediate from (i) and (ii). 2\n7\n3 The `small' ideals in B(E)\nIn this section we shall show that, for certain Banach spaces E, the ideals of approximable,\ncompact, strictly singular, and inessential operators on E coincide, and that there is a\nunique minimal closed ideal in B(E) properly containing these ideals. We refer to the\nabove-mentioned ideals as `small' because they are proper ideals in B(E) whenever E is\ninfinite-dimensional.\nWe proceed by modifying the techniques developed by Herman in his simplified proof\nof Theorem 1.1 (see [17] or [5, \u009f5.4]). Part of our argument is similar to that outlined\nin [20, p. 8].\n3.1 Definition. (i) A sequence (xn) in a Banach space is seminormalized if inf \u2016xn\u2016 > 0\nand sup \u2016xn\u2016 <\u221e.\n(ii) A sequence (xn) in a Banach space E is complemented in E if there is an idempotent\noperator P on E with imP = span{xn |n \u2208 N}.\n(iii) A basis (dn) of a Banach space D is semispreading if, for each strictly increasing\nsequence (mn) in N, there is an operator T on D with Tdn = dmn for each n \u2208 N.\n(iv) Let D and E be Banach spaces with bases (dn) and (en), respectively. We say\nthat seminormalized blocks of (en) contain complemented copies of (dn) if each semi-\nnormalized block basic sequence of (en) has a subsequence which is equivalent to (dn)\nand complemented in E.\n3.2 Theorem. Let D be a Banach space with a semispreading basis (dn), and let E\nbe a Banach space with a basis (en) such that seminormalized blocks of (en) contain\ncomplemented copies of (dn). Then, for each non-compact operator T on E, there are\noperators R : D \u2192 E and S : E \u2192 D such that ID = STR.\nThe proof of Theorem 3.2 requires some preliminary work. Our first lemma is proved\nusing a standard Cantor-style diagonal argument which we omit.\n3.3 Lemma. Let (Tn) be a sequence of compact operators from a Banach space E to a\nBanach space F . Then each bounded sequence (xm) in E has a subsequence (xmk) such\nthat, for each n \u2208 N, the sequence (Tnxmk)\u221ek=1 is convergent. 2\nSecond, we shall improve a classical stability result of Krein, Milman, and Rutman [21]\nand, independently, Bessaga and Pe\u00aaczy\u00abski [2]; alternatively, see [24, Proposition 1.a.9].\nOur proof is inspired by the proof of [27, Proposition 4.3.4].\n3.4 Lemma. Let (xn) be a basic sequence with basis constant K in a Banach space E,\nand let (yn) be a sequence in E such that\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u2016xn \u2212 yn\u2016\n\u2016xn\u2016 <\n1\n2K\n.\nThen (yn) is a basic sequence equivalent to (xn).\nSuppose that (xn) is complemented in E. Then (yn) is also complemented in E.\n8\nProof. For each m \u2208 N, let \u03d5m \u2208 E \u2032 with \u2016\u03d5m\u2016 6 2K\/\u2016xm\u2016 be a Hahn\u0015Banach extension\nof the mth coordinate functional associated with (xn). Then we can define an operator\nT : x 7\u2192\n\u221e\u2211\nm=1\n\u3008x, \u03d5m\u3009(xm \u2212 ym), E \u2192 E,\nand \u2016T\u2016 < 1, so that the operator U := IE \u2212 T is invertible. It follows that (yn) is a basic\nsequence equivalent to (xn) because Uxn = yn for each n \u2208 N.\nNow suppose that P is an idempotent operator on E with imP = span{xn |n \u2208 N}.\nThen Q := UPU\u22121 is an idempotent operator on E with imQ = span{yn |n \u2208 N}. 2\nLemma 3.4 improves its predecessors by asserting that (yn) is complemented in E\nwhenever (xn) is, no matter what the norm is of the idempotent operator P with image\nspan{xn |n \u2208 N}. This enables us to establish the following version of the Bessaga\u0015\nPe\u00aaczy\u00abski selection principle, specially tailored to match the set-up in Theorem 3.2.\n3.5 Lemma. Let D and E be Banach spaces with bases (dn) and (en), respectively, such\nthat seminormalized blocks of (en) contain complemented copies of (dn). Let (ym) be a\nseminormalized sequence in E such that \u3008ym, e\u2032k\u3009 \u2192 0 as m \u2192 \u221e for each (fixed) k \u2208 N,\nwhere e\u2032k denotes the k\nth coordinate functional associated with the basis (en). Then (ym)\nhas a subsequence which is equivalent to (dn) and complemented in E.\nProof. Let K be the basis constant of (en). As in the proof of the Bessaga\u0015Pe\u00aaczy\u00abski\nselection principle (see [2, Theorem 3]), we construct inductively a seminormalized block\nbasic sequence (xm) of (en) and a subsequence (y\u00afm) of (ym) such that\n\u221e\u2211\nm=1\n\u2016xm \u2212 y\u00afm\u2016\n\u2016xm\u2016 <\n1\n2K\n.\nBy assumption, (xm) has a subsequence (xmn) which is equivalent to (dn) and comple-\nmented in E. Now Lemma 3.4 implies that (y\u00afmn) has the required properties. 2\nProof of Theorem 3.2. Let (e\u2032n) denote the coordinate functionals associated with (en).\nTake a bounded sequence (xm) in E such that no subsequence of (Txm) is convergent.\nBy Lemma 3.3 (applied with Tn = e\n\u2032\nn and the bounded sequence (Txm)), (xm) has a\nsubsequence (x\u00afm) such that\n(\u3008T x\u00afm, e\u2032n\u3009)\u221em=1 is convergent for each n \u2208 N. Since (T x\u00afm) is\ndivergent, (x\u00afm) has a subsequence (x\u00afm) such that inf \u2016T x\u00afm+1 \u2212 T x\u00afm\u2016 > 0.\nSet zm := x\u00afm+1 \u2212 x\u00afm \u2208 E. Then (zm) is bounded, inf \u2016Tzm\u2016 > 0, and \u3008Tzm, e\u2032n\u3009 \u2192 0\nas m \u2192 \u221e for each n \u2208 N. It follows that no subsequence of (Tzm) can be convergent.\nAnother application of Lemma 3.3 yields a subsequence (z\u00afm) of (zm) such that\n(\u3008z\u00afm, e\u2032n\u3009)\u221em=1\nis convergent for each n \u2208 N. Since (T z\u00afm) is divergent, we can find a subsequence (z\u00afm)\nof (z\u00afm) such that inf \u2016T z\u00afm+1 \u2212 T z\u00afm\u2016 > 0.\nSet ym := z\u00afm+1 \u2212 z\u00afm \u2208 E. Then (ym) is bounded and inf \u2016Tym\u2016 > 0. This implies\nthat (ym) and (Tym) are seminormalized. Moreover, for each n \u2208 N, we have \u3008ym, e\u2032n\u3009 \u2192 0\n9\nand \u3008Tym, e\u2032n\u3009 \u2192 0 asm\u2192\u221e. By Lemma 3.5, (ym) has a subsequence (y\u00afm) which is equiv-\nalent to (dm). Take an operator U : D \u2192 E with Udm = y\u00afm (m \u2208 N). Applying Lemma 3.5\nonce more shows that (T y\u00afm) has a subsequence (T y\u00afmn) which is equivalent to (dn) and com-\nplemented in E. It follows that there is an operator S : E \u2192 D with S(T y\u00afmn) = dn (n \u2208 N).\nSince (dn) is semispreading, we can take an operator V on D with V dn = dmn (n \u2208 N).\nSet R := UV : D \u2192 E. Then we have\nSTRdn = STUdmn = ST y\u00afmn = dn (n \u2208 N),\nand the result follows. 2\n3.6 Definition. Let D, E, F , and G be Banach spaces. For each subset C of B(E,F ),\nset\nGC (D,G) := span\n{\nSTR\n\u2223\u2223 R \u2208 B(D,E), T \u2208 C, S \u2208 B(F,G)} \u2286 B(D,G). (3.1)\nSuppose that that C contains a non-zero operator. Then the assignment GC thus defined\nis an operator ideal, called the operator ideal generated by C. It is clearly the smallest\noperator ideal such that C \u2286 GC (E,F ).\nIn the case where E = F and C = {IE}, we write GE instead of GC .\nSuppose that the set C satisfies: for each T1, T2 \u2208 C , there are operators U : E\u2295E \u2192 E,\nV \u2208 C, and W : F \u2192 F \u2295 F such that T1 \u2295 T2 = WV U . Then the set{\nSTR\n\u2223\u2223 R \u2208 B(D,E), T \u2208 C, S \u2208 B(F,G)}\nis already a linear subspace ofB(D,G), and so the `span' appearing in (3.1) is superfluous.\nIn particular, in the case where E is a Banach space containing a complemented sub-\nspace isomorphic to E \u2295 E, then\nGE(D,G) =\n{\nSR\n\u2223\u2223 R \u2208 B(D,E), S \u2208 B(E,G)}\nfor each pair (D,G) of Banach spaces.\n3.7 Definition. Let E and F be Banach spaces, and let T : E \u2192 F be an operator.\nWe say that T is strictly singular if T is not bounded below on any infinite-dimensional\nsubspace of E, and we say that T is inessential if IE \u2212ST is a Fredholm operator for each\noperator S : F \u2192 E. We write S (E,F ) and E (E,F ) for the sets of strictly singular and\ninessential operators from E to F , respectively. The assignments S and E thus defined\nare closed operator ideals (e.g., see [28, \u009f1.9 and \u009f4.3]).\nIn general, the inclusions\nF (E,F ) \u2286 K (E,F ) \u2286 S (E,F ) \u2286 E (E,F ) \u2286 B(E,F ) (3.2)\nhold; the first inclusion can be replaced with equality if F has the approximation property.\nHowever, in the case where E = F and this is a Banach space of the form considered in\nTheorem 3.2, much more is true.\n10\n3.8 Corollary. Let D be a Banach space with a semispreading basis (dn), and let E\nbe a Banach space with a basis (en) such that seminormalized blocks of (en) contain\ncomplemented copies of (dn). Suppose thatJ is an ideal inB(E) not contained inF (E).\nThen J contains the ideal GD(E).\nIt follows that\nF (E) = K (E) = S (E) = E (E) ( GD(E),\nand there are no closed ideals J in B(E) such that F (E) (J ( GD(E).\nProof. This is immediate from Theorem 3.2 and (3.2). 2\n3.9 Example. Let D = c0 or D = `p, where 1 6 p < \u221e, and, for each n \u2208 N, let\nEn be a non-zero, finite-dimensional Banach space with a normalized, monotone basis\n(e\n(n)\n1 , . . . , e\n(n)\nNn\n). Then\n(en)\n\u221e\nn=1 :=\n(\nJE1 (e\n(1)\n1 ), J\nE\n1 (e\n(1)\n2 ), . . . , J\nE\n1 (e\n(1)\nN1\n), JE2 (e\n(2)\n1 ), J\nE\n2 (e\n(2)\n2 ), . . . , J\nE\n2 (e\n(2)\nN2\n), . . .\n. . . , JEn (e\n(n)\n1 ), J\nE\nn (e\n(n)\n2 ), . . . , J\nE\nn (e\n(n)\nNn\n), . . .\n)\nis a normalized, monotone basis of E :=\n(\u2295\nEn\n)\nD\n. We claim that seminormalized blocks\nof (en) contain complemented copies of the standard basis (dn) of D. (We note in passing\nthat, in the case where En = `\nn\nq for each n \u2208 N and some q \u2208 [1,\u221e], this is an easy conse-\nquence of a theorem of Casazza and Lin (see [7, Theorem 38] or [24, Proposition 2.a.12]).)\nTo prove the claim, let (xn) be a seminormalized block basic sequence of (en). For\neach x \u2208 E, set\nsupp x :=\n{\nm \u2208 N \u2223\u2223 QEm(x) 6= 0}.\nInductively we choose a subsequence (xnk) of (xn) such that\nmax(supp xnk) < min(suppxnk+1) (k \u2208 N).\nFor each k \u2208 N, take \u03d5k \u2208 E \u2032 such that \u2016\u03d5k\u2016 = 1\/\u2016xnk\u2016, \u3008xnk , \u03d5k\u3009 = 1, and \u3008x, \u03d5k\u3009 = 0\nwhenever x \u2208 E with supp x \u2229 supp xnk = \u2205. Since the sequence (xnk) is seminormalized,\nwe can define operators\nS : x 7\u2192 (\u3008x, \u03d5k\u3009)\u221ek=1, E \u2192 D, and T : (\u03b1k) 7\u2192 \u221e\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b1kxnk , D \u2192 E.\nClearly, we have Sxnk = dk and Tdk = xnk for each k \u2208 N. This implies that (xnk) is a\ncomplemented basic sequence equivalent to (dk), and the claim follows.\nThe basis (dn) is obviously semispreading, and so we conclude from Corollary 3.8 that\nF (E) = K (E) = S (E) = E (E) ( GD(E),\nand for each non-zero, closed ideal J in B(E), either J = F (E) or GD(E) \u2286J . 2\n11\n4 Operators on c0-direct sums\nIn this section we shall concentrate on the special situation where E =\n(\u2295\nEn\n)\nc0\nfor certain\nsequences (En) of Banach spaces. In particular we shall determine conditions which are\nsufficient for G c0(E) to be a maximal ideal in B(E).\nOur first lemma characterizes those matrices with finite columns that induce operators\nbetween c0-direct sums. The proof is straightforward and thus omitted.\n4.1 Lemma. Let (En) and (Fn) be sequences of Banach spaces, and let (Vm,n) be a matrix\nwith Vm,n \u2208 B(En, Fm) for each m,n \u2208 N and at most finitely many non-zero entries in\neach column. Then there is an operator V :\n(\u2295\nEn\n)\nc0\n\u2192 (\u2295Fn)c0 with matrix (Vm,n)\n(that is, Vm,n = Q\nF\nmV J\nE\nn for each m,n \u2208 N) if and only if there is a constant c > 0 such\nthat \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 N\u2211\nn=1\nVm,nxn\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 6 c max16n6N \u2016xn\u2016 (m,N \u2208 N, x1 \u2208 E1, . . . , xN \u2208 EN). (4.1)\nIn this case, \u2016V \u2016 = inf c, where the infimum is taken over the set of all c > 0 such that\n(4.1) holds. 2\nThe following construction will be important in the proof of the main result (Theo-\nrem 4.4) of this section.\n4.2 Construction. Let (En) and (Fn) be sequences of Banach spaces, and set\nE :=\n(\u2295\nEn\n)\nc0\nand F :=\n(\u2295\nFn\n)\nc0\n.\nLet T : E \u2192 F be an operator with finite columns. Define\n\u03bdm := rowsuppm(T ), Bm :=\n{\n{0} if \u03bdm = \u2205(\u2295\nn\u2208\u03bdm En\n)\nc0\notherwise\n(m \u2208 N),\nB :=\n(\u2295\nm\u2208N\nBm\n)\nc0\n, Vm,n :=\n{\nJBmn if n \u2208 \u03bdm\n0 otherwise\n\u2208 B(En, Bm) (m,n \u2208 N),\nwhere\n(\u2295\nn\u2208\u03bdm En\n)\nc0\nis the obvious generalization of\n(\u2295\nn\u2208NEn\n)\nc0\nto index sets \u03bdm ( N,\nand JBmn denotes the natural embedding of En into Bm for each n \u2208 \u03bdm.\nObserve that, for each m,n \u2208 N, Tm,n = 0 if and only if Vm,n = 0, and so (Vm,n)\nhas at most finitely many non-zero entries in each column. Since (Vm,n) clearly satisfies\ncondition (4.1) in Lemma 4.1 with c = 1, we conclude that there is an operator V : E \u2192 B\nwith matrix (Vm,n), and \u2016V \u2016 6 1.\nFor each m \u2208 N, let Lm be the canonical embedding of Bm into E. This is an isometry,\nand so T\u02dcm := Q\nF\nmTLm : Bm \u2192 Fm is an operator of norm at most \u2016T\u2016. It follows that\nthere is a diagonal operator diag(T\u02dcm) : B \u2192 F , as defined in \u009f2.5. We claim that\nT = diag(T\u02dcm)V. (4.2)\n12\nIndeed, for each m,n \u2208 N and x \u2208 En, we have\nQFm diag(T\u02dck)V J\nE\nn x = T\u02dcmQ\nB\nm(Vk,nx)\n\u221e\nk=1 = Q\nF\nmTLmVm,nx\n=\n{\nQFmTLmJ\nBm\nn x = Q\nF\nmTJ\nE\nn x if n \u2208 \u03bdm\n0 otherwise\n}\n= Tm,nx,\nand (4.2) follows. 2\n4.3 Definition. Let E and F be Banach spaces, and let T : E \u2192 F be an operator.\n(i) Let \u03b5 > 0. To measure the \u03b5-approximate factorization of the operator T through the\nfinite-dimensional spaces `M\u221e (M \u2208 N), we define\nfac\u03b5\u221e(T ) :=\ninf\n{\u2016S\u2016 \u2016R\u2016 \u2223\u2223M \u2208 N, R \u2208 B(E, `M\u221e), S \u2208 B(`M\u221e , F ), \u2016T \u2212 SR\u2016 6 \u03b5} \u2208 [0,\u221e].\n(ii) The operator T is \u221e-integral if there is a compact Hausdorff space \u2126, and two oper-\nators R : E \u2192 C(\u2126) and S : C(\u2126)\u2192 F \u2032\u2032 such that the diagram\nE\nT \/\/\nR\n\u001e\u001e>\n>>\n>>\n>>\n>>\n> F\n\u03baF \/\/ F \u2032\u2032\nC(\u2126)\nS\n??\nis commutative. We write I\u221e(E,F ) for the set of all \u221e-integral operators from E\nto F . The assignment I\u221e thus defined is an operator ideal.\nBefore stating our next theorem, we recall that, for an operator ideal J, J denotes\nthe closure of J.\n4.4 Theorem. Let (En) be a sequence of finite-dimensional Banach spaces, (Fn) a se-\nquence of dual Banach spaces, and set E :=\n(\u2295\nEn\n)\nc0\nand F :=\n(\u2295\nFn\n)\nc0\n. For each\noperator T : E \u2192 F with locally finite matrix, the following three assertions are equiva-\nlent:\n(a) T \u2208 G c0(E,F );\n(b) T \u2208 I\u221e(E,F );\n(c) sup\n{\nfac\u03b5\u221e(Q\nF\nmT )\n\u2223\u2223 m \u2208 N} <\u221e for each \u03b5 > 0.\nProof. (a)\u21d2(b). This is clear because the Banach spaces c0, c, and C(N\u221e) are isomorphic,\nwhere N\u221e denotes the one-point compactification of N.\n(b)\u21d2(c). Suppose that T \u2208 I\u221e(E,F ). Given \u03b5 > 0, take a compact Hausdorff space \u2126\nand operators R : E \u2192 C(\u2126) and S : C(\u2126) \u2192 F \u2032\u2032 such that \u2016\u03baFT \u2212 SR\u2016 6 \u03b5.

Let (En) be a sequence of finite-dimensional Banach spaces, (Fn) a se-\nquence of dual Banach spaces, set E :=\n(\u2295\nEn\n)\nc0\nand F :=\n(\u2295\nFn\n)\nc0\n, and let T : E \u2192 F\nbe an operator with locally finite matrix. Then T \/\u2208 G c0(E,F ) if and only if there is a\nnon-empty subset \u03bd of N such that the operator P F\u03bd T has consecutively supported rows\nand P F\u03bd T \/\u2208 G c0(E,F ).\nProof. Suppose that T \/\u2208 G c0(E,F ). Then Theorem 4.4 implies that\nsup\n{\nfac\u03b5\u221e(Q\nF\nmT )\n\u2223\u2223 m \u2208 N} =\u221e\nfor some \u03b5 > 0.

We observe that the kth row of the matrix of P F\u03bd T is equal to the\nkth row of the matrix of T if k \u2208 \u03bd and zero otherwise. It follows that the operator P F\u03bd T\nhas consecutively supported rows, and Theorem 4.4 implies that P F\u03bd T \/\u2208 G c0(E,F ) because\nfac\u03b5\u221e(Q\nF\nMm\nP F\u03bd T ) > m for each m \u2208 N.\nThe converse implication is immediate from the fact that G c0 is an operator ideal. 2\n4.7 Lemma. Let E and F be Banach spaces, and let P be an idempotent operator on E.\nThen P \u2208 G F (E) if and only if, for some n \u2208 N, there is an idempotent operator Q on F\u2295n\nwith imQ \u223c= imP .\nProof. `\u21d2'. Suppose that P \u2208 G F (E). Then in fact P \u2208 GF (E) by [23, Proposition 3.4],\nand so P =\n\u2211n\nj=1 SjRj for some n \u2208 N, R1, . . . , Rn \u2208 B(E,F ), and S1, . . . , Sn \u2208 B(F,E).\nClearly, the operators\nR : x 7\u2192 (R1x, . . . , Rnx), E \u2192 F\u2295n, and S : (x1, . . . , xn) 7\u2192\nn\u2211\nj=1\nSjxj, F\n\u2295n \u2192 E,\nsatisfy P = SR. This implies by [23, Lemma 3.6(ii)] that Q := RSRS \u2208 B(F\u2295n) is\nidempotent with imQ \u223c= imP .\n`\u21d0'. Suppose that Q is an idempotent operator on F\u2295n with imQ \u223c= imP . By [23,\nLemma 3.6(i)], there are operators R : E \u2192 F\u2295n and S : F\u2295n \u2192 E such that P = SR and\nQ = RS. For each j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, set Rj := QjR \u2208 B(E,F ) and Sj := SJj \u2208 B(F,E),\nwhere Jj : F \u2192 F\u2295n and Qj : F\u2295n \u2192 F are the jth coordinate embedding and projection,\nrespectively. Then we have\nn\u2211\nj=1\nSjRj = S\n( n\u2211\nj=1\nJjQj\n)\nR = P,\nand so P \u2208 GF (E). 2\n4.8 Corollary. Let P be an idempotent operator on a Banach space E. Then P \u2208 G c0(E)\nif and only if imP is either finite-dimensional or isomorphic to c0.\n15\nProof. Suppose that P \u2208 G c0(E). Then Lemma 4.7 implies that, for some n \u2208 N, there\nis an idempotent operator Q on c\u2295n0 with imQ \u223c= imP . Since c\u2295n0 \u223c= c0, Pe\u00aaczy\u00abski's\ntheorem [24, Theorem 2.a.3] shows that either imQ is finite-dimensional or imQ \u223c= c0, and\nso the same is true for imP .\nThe converse implication is clear. 2\nApplying this result with P being the identity operator yields the following conclusion.\n4.9 Corollary. Let E be a Banach space. Then G c0(E) = B(E) if and only if E is either\nfinite-dimensional or isomorphic to c0. 2\n4.10 Theorem. Let (En) be a sequence of non-zero, finite-dimensional Banach spaces,\neach having a normalized, monotone basis, and set E :=\n(\u2295\nEn\n)\nc0\n. Then the lattice of\nclosed ideals in B(E) is given by\n{0} ( F (E) ( G c0(E) ( B(E) (4.3)\nif and only if the following two conditions are satisfied:\n(i) E 6\u223c= c0;\n(ii) for each operator T on E with locally finite matrix and consecutively supported rows,\neither T \u2208 G c0(E) or G {T}(E) = B(E).\nProof. Suppose that the lattice of closed ideals in B(E) is given by (4.3). Then E 6\u223c= c0\nbecause otherwise we would have G c0(E) = B(E), contradicting (4.3). Moreover, if T is\nany operator on E such that T \/\u2208 G c0(E), then necessarily G {T}(E) = B(E) by (4.3).\nConversely, suppose that E 6\u223c= c0 and that the lattice of closed ideals in B(E) is\nnot given by (4.3). Corollary 4.9 shows that G c0(E) is a proper ideal in B(E), and so\nExample 3.9 implies that there is a proper closed idealJ inB(E) such that G c0(E) (J.\nPick R \u2208J \\ G c0(E). By Lemma 2.7(iii), we can find an approximable operator S on E\nsuch that R \u2212 S has locally finite matrix. Since R \u2212 S \/\u2208 G c0(E), Corollary 4.6 implies\nthat there is a subset \u03bd of N such that the operator T := PE\u03bd (R \u2212 S) has consecutively\nsupported rows and T \/\u2208 G c0(E). The ideal G {T}(E) is proper because T \u2208J and J is\nproper. 2\nFinally in this section we shall characterize the approximable operators between cer-\ntain c0-direct sums. The proof is an easy combination of standard methods, but for the\nconvenience of the reader we have included it.\n4.11 Proposition. Let (En) be a sequence of Banach spaces, (Fn) a sequence of finite-\ndimensional Banach spaces, and set E :=\n(\u2295\nEn\n)\nc0\nand F :=\n(\u2295\nFn\n)\nc0\n. Then, for each\noperator T : E \u2192 F , the following three assertions are equivalent:\n(a) T \u2208 F (E,F );\n(b) \u2016T \u2212 P F{1,...,n}T\u2016 \u2192 0 as n\u2192\u221e;\n(c) \u2016QFnT\u2016 \u2192 0 as n\u2192\u221e.\n16\nProof. (a)\u21d2(c). Clearly, it suffices to verify that (c) holds for each non-zero finite-\nrank operator T : E \u2192 F . Take a basis (y1, . . . , ym) for imT , and let (y\u20321, . . . , y\u2032m) be the\nassociated coordinate functionals, so that Tx =\n\u2211m\nk=1\u3008Tx, y\u2032k\u3009 yk for each x \u2208 E. Then we\nhave\n\u2016QFnT\u2016 6\nm\u2211\nk=1\n\u2016QFn yk\u2016 \u2016T \u2032y\u2032k\u2016 \u2192 0 as n\u2192\u221e,\nas required.\n(c)\u21d4(b). For each n \u2208 N, we have\n\u2016T \u2212 P F{1,...,n}T\u2016 = sup\n{\u2016(T \u2212 P F{1,...,n}T )x\u2016 \u2223\u2223 x \u2208 E, \u2016x\u2016 6 1}\n= sup\n{\u2016QFm(T \u2212 P F{1,...,n}T )x\u2016 \u2223\u2223 m \u2208 N, x \u2208 E, \u2016x\u2016 6 1}\n= sup\n{\u2016QFmTx\u2016 \u2223\u2223 m > n, x \u2208 E, \u2016x\u2016 6 1} = sup{\u2016QFmT\u2016 \u2223\u2223 m > n},\nand so (c) and (b) are equivalent.\n(b)\u21d2(a). This is clear because P F{1,...,n} \u2208 F (F ) for each n \u2208 N. 2\n5 Classification of the closed ideals in B\n((\u2295\n`n2\n)\nc0\n)\nIn this section we shall join the ends together to prove our main result: the Banach\nspace E :=\n(\u2295\n`n2\n)\nc0\nsatisfies the two conditions in Theorem 4.10, and so the lattice of\nclosed ideals in B(E) is given by (4.3).\nWe begin with the fundamental observation that\n(\u2295\n`n2\n)\nc0\nis not isomorphic to c0.\nThis result is well known, but by no means easy, its proof relying either on Grothendieck's\ntheorem (see [24, p. 73] for details) or on the fact that the second dual of c0 has the\nDunford\u0015Pettis property, whereas the second dual of\n(\u2295\n`n2\n)\nc0\ndoes not (see [9, p. 22]).\n5.1 Theorem. The Banach space\n(\u2295\n`n2\n)\nc0\nis not isomorphic to c0. 2\nAt this point, we should like to recall our convention from \u009f2.1 that finite direct sums\nare always equipped with the `n\u221e-norm, so that even in the case where H1, . . . , Hn are\nHilbert spaces, the norm of an element (x1, . . . , xn) \u2208 H1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295Hn is given by (2.1).\n5.2 Definition. (i) Suppose that G is a closed subspace of a Hilbert spaceH. We denote\nby G\u22a5 the orthogonal complement of G, and write projHG for the orthogonal projection\nof H onto G (so that projHG is the idempotent operator on H with im proj\nH\nG = G and\nker projHG = G\n\u22a5).\n(ii) Let n \u2208 N, let H1, . . . , Hn be Hilbert spaces, and let E be a Banach space. For\neach \u03b5 > 0 and each operator T : H1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295Hn \u2192 E, we define\nm\u03b5(T ) := sup\n{\nm \u2208 N0\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2225\u2225T((IH1 \u2212 projH1G1)\u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 (IHn \u2212 projHnGn))\u2225\u2225 > \u03b5\nwhenever Gj is a subspace of Hj\nwith dimGj 6 m for each j = 1, . . . , n\n}\n\u2208 N0 \u222a {\u00b1\u221e}.\n(By convention, we have sup \u2205 = \u2212\u221e.)\n17\nHence, m\u03b5(T ) is the largest number m such that, no matter what subspace Gj of Hj of\ndimension at most m that we remove for j = 1, . . . , n, the restriction of the operator T to\nthe complement has norm greater than \u03b5. We shall now show that this number m\u03b5(T ) is\nclosely related to the \u03b5-approximate factorization number fac\u03b5\u221e(T ) that we introduced in\nSection 4.\n5.3 Lemma. Let n \u2208 N, letH1, . . . , Hn, andK be Hilbert spaces, let T : H1\u2295\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2295Hn \u2192 K\nbe an operator, and let 0 < \u03b5 < \u2016T\u2016.

(i) The fact that \u03b5 < \u2016T\u2016 ensures that m\u03b5(T ) > 0. If m\u03b5(T ) = \u221e, then the\ninequality is trivial. Otherwise set m := m\u03b5(T ) + 1 \u2208 N. By the definition of m\u03b5(T ), there\nare subspaces G1, . . . , Gn of H1, . . . , Hn, respectively, each of dimension at most m, such\nthat \u2225\u2225T((IH1 \u2212 projH1G1)\u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 (IHn \u2212 projHnGn))\u2225\u2225 6 \u03b5. (5.1)\nLet j = 1, . . . , n. Since the formal identity operators `m2 \u2192 `m\u221e and `m\u221e \u2192 `m2 have norms 1\nand\n\u221a\nm, respectively, we can find operators Rj : Hj \u2192 `m\u221e and Sj : `m\u221e \u2192 Hj such that\n\u2016Rj\u2016 = 1, \u2016Sj\u2016 6\n\u221a\nm, and proj\nHj\nGj\n= SjRj.

Hence the\ninduction continues.\nDefine R : `m2 \u2192 H1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295Hn by Rek = xk for each k = 1, . . . ,m. Using (1), (2), and\nPythagoras's formula, we deduce that \u2016R\u2016 6 1. Next, define\nS1 : y 7\u2192\nm\u2211\nk=1\n(y |Txk)\n\u2016Txk\u2016 ek, K \u2192 `\nm\n2 .\nBy (3) and Bessel's inequality, we obtain \u2016S1\u2016 = 1. Finally, we define S2 : `m2 \u2192 `m2 by\nS2ek :=\n1\n\u2016Txk\u2016ek (k = 1, . . . ,m).\nThen (1) implies that \u2016S2\u2016 6 1\/\u03b5, and so S := S2S1 : K \u2192 `m2 satisfies \u2016S\u2016 6 1\/\u03b5. Clearly\nwe have STRek = ek for each k = 1, . . . ,m, and the result follows. 2\n5.4 Remark. Let (Hn) be a sequence of Hilbert spaces, set E :=\n(\u2295\nHn\n)\nc0\n, and let T be\nan operator on E with finite rows. Then, for each \u03b5 > 0 and each n \u2208 N, there is a natural\nway to define m\u03b5(Q\nE\nnT ), namely by `forgetting' the cofinite number of Hilbert spaces on\nwhich QEnT acts trivially. To be specific, if Q\nE\nnT = 0, then we set m\u03b5(Q\nE\nnT ) := \u2212\u221e.\nOtherwise \u03bd := rowsuppn(T ) is a finite, non-empty set, and so F :=\n\u2295\nj\u2208\u03bd Hj is a finite\ndirect sum of Hilbert spaces. Let L : F \u2192 E be the natural inclusion operator, and define\nm\u03b5(Q\nE\nnT ) := m\u03b5(Q\nE\nnTL),\nwhere the quantity on the right-hand side is defined as in Definition 5.2(ii). We note in\npassing that QEnT = Q\nE\nnTLP , where P : E \u2192 F is the natural projection.\n19\nWe are now ready to prove the following trichotomy theorem for operators on\n(\u2295\n`n2\n)\nc0\nwith locally finite matrix.\n5.5 Theorem. Set E :=\n(\u2295\n`n2\n)\nc0\n, and let T be an operator on E with locally finite\nmatrix. Then:\n(i) T \u2208 F (E) if and only if \u2016QEnT\u2016 \u2192 0 as n\u2192\u221e;\n(ii) T \u2208 G c0(E) if and only if sup\n{\nm\u03b5(Q\nE\nnT )\n\u2223\u2223 n \u2208 N} <\u221e for each \u03b5 > 0;\n(iii) there are operators R and S on E such that STR = IE if and only if\nsup\n{\nm\u03b5(Q\nE\nnT )\n\u2223\u2223 n \u2208 N} =\u221e\nfor some \u03b5 > 0.\nProof. (i). This is a special case of Proposition 4.11.\n(ii), \u21d0. Let \u03b5 > 0 be given, and suppose that sup{m\u03b5(QEnT ) \u2223\u2223 n \u2208 N} < \u221e. Then it\nfollows from Lemma 5.3(i) that sup\n{\nfac\u03b5\u221e(Q\nE\nnT )\n\u2223\u2223 n \u2208 N} <\u221e as well, and so T \u2208 G c0(E)\nby Theorem 4.4.\n(iii), \u21d0. Suppose that sup{m\u03b5(QEnT ) \u2223\u2223 n \u2208 N} = \u221e for some \u03b5 > 0. Inductively\nwe construct a strictly increasing sequence (nk) in N such that m\u03b5(QEnkT ) > 2k \u2212 2 and\nsup(rowsuppnk T ) < inf(rowsuppnk+1 T ) for each k \u2208 N. Set\nM0 := 0, Mk := sup(rowsuppnk T ) \u2208 N, and Fk :=\nMk\u2295\nn=Mk\u22121+1\n`n2 ,\nand let Lk : Fk \u2192 E be the natural inclusion map for each k \u2208 N. Then\nm\u03b5(Q\nE\nnk\nTLk) = m\u03b5(Q\nE\nnk\nT ) > 2k \u2212 2,\nand so Lemma 5.3(ii) implies that there are operators Rk : `\nk\n2 \u2192 Fk and Sk : `nk2 \u2192 `k2 such\nthat \u2016Rk\u2016 6 1, \u2016Sk\u2016 6 1\/\u03b5, and I`k2 = SkQEnkTLkRk.\nSet R := diag(Rk) : E \u2192\n(\u2295\nFk\n)\nc0\n. By ignoring parentheses, we identify\n(\u2295\nFk\n)\nc0\nwith E, and thus we regard R as an operator mapping into E. Define S : (xn) 7\u2192 (Skxnk),\nE \u2192 E. Then S is an operator of norm at most 1\/\u03b5, and for each j, k \u2208 N, we have\nQEj STRJ\nE\nk = SjQ\nE\nnj\nTLkRk =\n{\nI`k2 if j = k\n0 otherwise.\nIt follows that STR = IE, as desired.\nFinally, the implications \u21d2 in (ii) and (iii) follow from what we have already shown\ntogether with the fact that G c0(E) 6= B(E) (cf. Corollary 4.9 and Theorem 5.1). 2\nIn particular, we see that condition (ii) in Theorem 4.10 is satisfied, and so we obtain\nthe following result.\n5.6 Corollary. For the Banach space E :=\n(\u2295\n`n2\n)\nc0\n, there are exactly four distinct closed\nideals in B(E), and they are totally ordered by inclusion. More specifically, the lattice of\nclosed ideals in B(E) is given by (4.3). 2\n20\n6 A new proof of a theorem of Bourgain, Casazza,\nLindenstrauss, and Tzafriri\nOur first clue that the classification of the closed ideals inB(E) for E :=\n(\u2295\n`n2\n)\nc0\nobtained\nin Section 5 might be true came from the following theorem which, roughly speaking, asserts\nthat E has no `exotic' complemented subspaces.\n6.1 Theorem. (Bourgain, Casazza, Lindenstrauss, and Tzafriri [3]) Let F be an infinite-\ndimensional, complemented subspace of the Banach space E :=\n(\u2295\n`n2\n)\nc0\n. Then F is either\nisomorphic to c0 or to E. 2\nIn this section we shall show how one can apply Corollary 5.6 to give a new and, we\nfeel, more elementary proof of this theorem. To do so, we require a few preparations.\n6.2 Definition. A Banach space E is primary if, for each idempotent operator P on E,\neither imP \u223c= E or kerP \u223c= E (or both).\n6.3 Lemma. Let E and F be Banach spaces. Suppose that E is primary and that E is\nisomorphic to F\u2295n for some n \u2208 N. Then E and F are isomorphic.\nProof. Wemay suppose that n \u2208 N is chosen to be the smallest integer such that E \u223c= F\u2295n.\nSince F\u2295n = F \u2295F\u2295(n\u22121) and E is primary, this implies that either E \u223c= F or E \u223c= F\u2295(n\u22121).\nThe latter case contradicts the minimality of n, and so we conclude that E \u223c= F . 2\n6.4 Proposition. (Casazza, Kottman, and Lin [6]) Set E :=\n(\u2295\n`n2\n)\nc0\n. Then:\n(i) E is isomorphic to E \u2295 E;\n(ii) E is primary.\nProof. This follows immediately from [6, Corollary 7 and Theorem 10]. 2\nProof of Theorem 6.1. Let P be an idempotent operator on E :=\n(\u2295\n`n2\n)\nc0\nwith\ninfinite-dimensional image. Proposition 6.4(ii) implies that either imP \u223c= E or kerP \u223c= E.\nIf imP \u223c= E, then there is nothing to prove, and so we may suppose that kerP \u223c= E. Since\nP is idempotent and has infinite-dimensional image, P is non-compact. By Corollary 5.6,\nthere are two cases to consider:\n(i) G {P}(E) = G c0(E);\n(ii) G {P}(E) = B(E).\nIn case (i), Corollary 4.8 shows that imP \u223c= c0.\nIn case (ii), it follows from Lemma 4.7 (applied with the Banach space F := imP\nand the idempotent operator IE \u2208 G F (E)) that we can take n \u2208 N and an idempotent\noperator Q on (imP )\u2295n such that imQ \u223c= E. Then we have\nE \u223c= E\u2295n \u223c= (imP )\u2295n \u2295 (kerP )\u2295n \u223c= imQ\u2295 kerQ\u2295 E\u2295n \u223c= E \u2295 kerQ \u223c= (imP )\u2295n\n21\nby repeated use of Proposition 6.4(i). Now Lemma 6.3 and Proposition 6.4(ii) imply that\nimP \u223c= E. 2\n6.5 Remark. In fact, Bourgain, Casazza, Lindenstrauss, and Tzafriri prove analogues of\nTheorem 6.1 for other Banach spaces than\n(\u2295\n`n2\n)\nc0\n. To state their results in a unified\nway, set E :=\n(\u2295\nEn\n)\nD\n, where D and En are given in one of the following four ways:\n(i) D = c0 and En = `\nn\n2 for each n \u2208 N;\n(ii) D = c0 and En = `\nn\n1 for each n \u2208 N;\n(iii) D = `1 and En = `\nn\n2 for each n \u2208 N;\n(iv) D = `1 and En = `\nn\n\u221e for each n \u2208 N.\nThen it is shown in [3, \u009f8] that, for each infinite-dimensional, complemented subspace F\nof E, either F is isomorphic to D or F is isomorphic to E.\nIn the light of these results and Corollary 5.6, it is natural to ask what the closed ideals\nin B(E) are in the cases (ii)\u0015(iv).\nAnother Banach space for which this question attracts attention is E :=\n(\u2295\n`np\n)\nc0\nfor\na fixed p > 1. It follows from [24, p. 72f] that E contains a complemented subspace\nisomorphic to\n(\u2295\n`n2\n)\nc0\n, as well as the `trivial' complemented subspaces isomorphic to c0\nand of finite dimension. Consequently, for p 6= 2,B(E) contains at least five distinct closed\nideals, but we do not know if there are any others.\nWe intend to address these questions in future work.\nAcknowledgements\nThis paper was initiated during a visit of the first author to the Australian National\nUniversity.
