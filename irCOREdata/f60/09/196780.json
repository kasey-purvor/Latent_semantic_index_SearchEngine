Doi: 10.1029\/2002GB001928We evaluated how climate influences interannual variability in the terrestrial Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) of CO2 using the Simple Biosphere Model, Version 2 (SiB2) for 1983 to 1993 on a global, 1\u00b0 by 1\u00b0 latitude\/longitude grid with a 10-min time step. We quantified climate influences on NEE, explained regional differences, and related NEE variability to the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The simulated NEE reproduces the salient features and magnitude of the measured global CO2 growth rate. The Northern Hemisphere shows a pattern of alternating positive and negative NEE anomalies that cancel such that the tropics dominate the global simulated NEE interannual variability. Climate influences have strong regional differences with precipitation dominating in the tropics and temperature in the extratropics. In tropical regions with drier soils, precipitation control of photosynthesis (i.e., drought stress) dominates; in nearly saturated soils, precipitation control of respiration dominates. Because of cancellation and competing effects, no single climate variable controls global or regional NEE interannual variability. Globally, precipitation accounts for 44% of NEE variability; followed by Leaf Area Index (23%), soil carbon (12%), and temperature (16%). The influence of ENSO on NEE variability is consistent with that expected for shifting precipitation patterns in the tropics. Except in northern Europe, temperature advection by the AO does not significantly influence NEE variability. Neither the AO nor ENSO fully explain the temperature influence on respiration or the simulated NEE anomaly pattern in the Northern Hemisphere","downloadUrl":"http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2381\/8982","fullTextIdentifier":"https:\/\/lra.le.ac.uk\/bitstream\/2381\/8982\/3\/Schaeferetal2002GB001928.pdf","pdfHashValue":"d9f4e28bd24e76640089d31d06e839c71e1a7e72","publisher":"American Geophysical Union (AGU)","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381\/8982<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2015-12-14T17:06:41Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2381_262<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_9549<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_269<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nEffect of climate on interannual variability of terrestrial CO2 fluxes<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nSchaefer, Kevin<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nDenning, A.

Introduction\n[2] The measured atmospheric CO2 growth rate is only\nabout half that expected based on fossil fuel emissions.\nModeling, isotope, and inversion studies place much of this\n\u2018\u2018missing sink\u2019\u2019 in the Northern Hemisphere terrestrial bio-\nsphere, but its spatial distribution is not well known. The\nglobal, atmospheric CO2 growth rate shows a great deal of\ninterannual variability [Conway et al., 1994; Lloyd, 1999;\nRayner and Law, 1999; Tans and Wallace, 1999; Bousquet\net al., 2000; Fung, 2000]. The ocean fluxes show relatively\nlow variability [Rayner and Law, 1999; Le Que\u00b4re\u00b4 et al.,\n2000], so the growth rate variability is attributed primarily\nto changes in the terrestrial sink [Sarmiento, 1993; Conway\net al., 1994; Trolier et al., 1996; Kaduk and Heimann, 1997;\nLLoyd, 1999; Houghton et al., 1998; Tans and Wallace,\n1999; Houghton, 2000; Prince et al., 2000]. The large\nvariability in land fluxes makes it difficult to determine\nlong-term trends in the terrestrial sink [Fung, 2000]. Cli-\nmate, land use change, natural disturbance, CO2 fertiliza-\ntion, and nitrogen deposition all affect terrestrial CO2 fluxes\n[Conway et al., 1994; Bousquet et al., 2000; Fung, 2000;\nHoughton, 2000]. Climate may be the most important\ncontributor to interannual variability [Houghton, 2000],\nbut how it controls net terrestrial CO2 fluxes is unclear.\n[3] Lacking direct measurements of net global CO2\nfluxes, we estimate net terrestrial fluxes from satellite data,\ninversions, and models. Satellite data, for example, the\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), is used\nto estimate the Leaf Area Index, which, in combination with\na model, is used to estimate global net primary production\n[e.g., Goetz et al., 2000; Ichii et al., 2001]. Since NDVI\ndoes not contain direct information about respiration, we\nGLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES, VOL. 16, NO. 4, 1102, doi:10.1029\/2002GB001928, 2002\n1Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University, Fort\nCollins, Colorado, USA.\n2Department of Geography, University of Leicester, Leicester, United\nKingdom.\n3Department of Geography, University of Wales, Swansea, United\nKingdom.\nCopyright 2002 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0886-6236\/02\/2002GB001928$12.00\n49 - 1\ncannot use it to estimate net terrestrial fluxes. Inversions can\nestimate net fluxes for large, continental scale regions, but\ncannot isolate the exact causes of variability [e.g., Bousquet\net al., 2000]. Terrestrial carbon models range from highly\nmechanistic biogeochemical process models to statistical\nregression and bookkeeping models. Biogeochemistry mod-\nels track the amount of carbon in various biological pools\n[e.g., Ichii et al., 2001], but vary widely in the number of\npools and how explicitly they represent photosynthesis and\nrespiration processes. Many of these suggest temperature\nand precipitation have the most influence on interannual\nvariability, but disagree on the exact mechanism [e.g.,\nKaduk and Heimann, 1997; LLoyd, 1999; Dickinson,\n2000; Houghton, 2000]. The influence of climate variability\ndiffers considerably between ecosystems and regions with\nrespiration dominating in some areas [Houghton, 2000] and\nphotosynthesis in others [Kaduk and Heimann, 1997]. How\navailable light and humidity influence CO2 flux variability\nis not known.\n[4] To quantify the effects of climate interannual varia-\nbility on terrestrial CO2 fluxes, we calculated photosynthesis\nand respiration using a land surface model of leaf- and\ncanopy-level photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration. We\nuse the process information in the model to quantify how\neach climate variable influences the interannual variability of\nterrestrial CO2 fluxes and explain regional and ecosystem\ndifferences. Past research emphasized validation of models\nagainst measurements from the global CO2 flask network,\ncomparisons between models [e.g., McGuire et al., 2001],\nand the partition between land and ocean CO2 fluxes [e.g.,\nHoughton, 2000]. Recent research emphasizes what factors\n(climate, land use, etc.) most influence the interannual\nvariability of NDVI [Los et al., 2001] and terrestrial CO2\nfluxes [Kaduk and Heimann, 1997; Potter and Klooster,\n1999]. We quantify how interannual climate variability\naffects terrestrial CO2 fluxes and relate the results to known\nclimatic phenomena.\n2. Methods\n[5] We used the Simple Biosphere model, Version 2\n(SiB2) to estimate the terrestrial Net Ecosystem Exchange\n(NEE) for 1983 to 1993 on a global, 1\u0001 by 1\u0001 latitude\/\nlongitude grid with a 10-min time step [Sellers et al.,\n1996a]. We investigated the effects of climate variability\nonly and did not consider variability due to ocean uptake,\nfossil fuel emissions, land use, CO2 fertilization, natural\ndisturbances, or nitrogen deposition.\n[6] SiB2 has high time resolution and detailed plant\nphysiology to isolate the long-term influences of climate\nfactors with strong diurnal variability, such as temperature\nand humidity. SiB2 uses the Farquhar et al. [1980] photo-\nsynthesis model scaled to the canopy level [Sellers et al.,\n1996a], the Ball-Berry-Collatz stomatal conductance model\n[Ball, 1988; Collatz et al., 1991, 1992], and the respiration\nmodel of Denning et al. [1996]. SiB2 accounts for the\neffects of snow cover, rainfall interception by the canopy,\nand aerodynamic turbulence [Sellers et al., 1996a]. SiB2\nseparately tracks canopy and canopy air space prognostic\nvariables (temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, etc.).\nAs input, SiB2 requires Leaf Area Index (LAI), vegeta-\ntion cover fraction, vegetation type, soil type, and weather\ndata.\n[7] We estimated LAI using global, 1\u0001 by 1\u0001 monthly\ncomposite maps of NDVI adjusted for missing data, satellite\norbit drift, differing instrument calibrations, sensor degra-\ndation, and volcanic aerosols [Sellers et al., 1994; Los,\n1998; Los et al., 2000]. Using remotely sensed LAI\nestimates simplified our model, since the observations\nalready include the effects of age distribution, land use,\nand climate history. However, evaluating the effects of\nvariability in biomass was more difficult since SiB2 does\nnot track the various carbon and nitrogen pools. Sellers et\nal. [1994, 1996b] describes in detail the vegetation charac-\nteristics, soil types, and soil characteristics used as input.\nWe used the DeFries and Townshend [1994] global map of\n11 vegetation types.\n[8] Los et al. [2000] assumed the vegetation cover frac-\ntion, fV, was proportional to the absorbed fraction of photo-\nsynthetically active radiation ( fPAR):\nfV \u00bc f PARpeak\nf PARmax\n; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere fPARpeak is the peak value of the absorbed fraction of\nPAR for each grid cell and fPARmax = 0.95 is the maximum\npossible fPAR. We estimated fPAR using an average bet-\nween the simple ratio and NDVI methods [Los et al., 2000].\nLos et al. [2000] used the annual peak fPAR, which varies\nyear-to-year, causing abrupt changes in fV each January. An\n11-year average fPARpeak artificially dampens variability in\nthose years exceeding the average. We assumed fV did not\nvary with time and used the fPARpeak for the entire 11-year\nperiod.\n[9] Weather data were prescribed from the European\nCentre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)\nReanalysis [Gibson et al., 1999]. ECMWF Reanalysis\ncontains surface temperature, pressure, wind speed, precip-\nitation, and radiation data every 6 hours on a 1\u0001 by 1\u0001 grid.\nExcept for the incident light, the ECMWF data was linearly\ninterpolated between data points. The incident light was\nscaled by the cosine of the solar zenith angle to assure no\nlight falls on the canopy at night while simultaneously\nconserving energy. ECMWF data were available for 1978\nthrough 1993 and NDVI data for 1983 through 1999.\nOverlap between these two data sets limited this study to\n1983 through 1993.\n[10] NEE, the net flux of CO2 from the terrestrial bio-\nsphere, is defined as\nNEE \u00bc R\u0004 GPP; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere R is ecosystem respiration and GPP is gross primary\nproduction (i.e., canopy photosynthesis rate). Photosynth-\nesis removes CO2 from the atmosphere and respiration\nreturns CO2 to the atmosphere. A positive NEE indicates a\nnet CO2 flux into the atmosphere. GPP is resource-limited\nby Rubisco (nitrogen) capacity, available light, or leaf\nexport capacity. Breaking R into autotrophic and hetero-\ntrophic respiration gives\nNEE \u00bc RH \u00fe RR \u00fe RC \u0004 GPP; \u00f03\u00de\n49 - 2 SCHAEFER ET AL.: CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND TERRESTRIAL CO2 FLUXES\nwhere RH is heterotrophic respiration, RR is root autotrophic\nrespiration, and RC is canopy autotrophic respiration.\nHeterotrophic respiration is the decay of organic material\nby microorganisms. Autotrophic respiration is the release of\nCO2 during plant maintenance and growth. Defining ground\nrespiration as Rg = RH + RR and canopy net assimilation as\nAn = GPP \u0004 RC gives:\nNEE \u00bc Rg \u0004 An: \u00f04\u00de\n[11] Rg depends on soil temperature, soil moisture, and\nthe mass of carbon in the respiring pools [Parton et al.,\n1993; Raich et al., 1991; Hunt et al., 1996]. A serious\ntechnical issue arises when initializing the magnitudes of\nrespiring carbon pools on a global, 1\u0001 by 1\u0001 grid. Two\napproaches used in the past are (1) \u2018\u2018spinning up\u2019\u2019 from a\nstate of zero carbon [e.g., Potter et al., 1993] and (2)\nextrapolating from representative field studies [e.g., Craig\net al., 1998]. Spin up requires long integration times,\nbecause some of the soil carbon pools are very long-lived.\nRanderson et al. [1997] spun up the CASA model for 5000\nsimulated years before analyzing any results. Spin up has\nthe advantage that ecosystem respiration and photosynthesis\nare everywhere balanced with respect to climate forcing, but\nis computationally prohibitive for our model (which uses a\n10-min time step). Extrapolation is computationally effi-\ncient and allows for the possibilities of time-mean sources\nand sinks, but it is impossible to establish the veracity of\nglobal fields of biogeochemical pools defined everywhere\nfrom a few dozen field studies. Craig et al. [1998] used\nextrapolation and produced regional net sources and sinks\nof CO2 in excess of 5 GtC\/yr, which seems unreasonable.\n[12] For our study, we adapted the respiration model of\nDenning et al. [1996], where the instantaneous value of Rg\ndepends on soil temperature and moisture:\nRg \u00bc R*Rf ; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere R* is a combined soil temperature and moisture\nscaling factor and Rf is the respiration factor. Following\nRaich et al. [1991], R* = fT(T ) fW (W ), where fT is the\ntemperature response function, T is temperature, fW is the\nsoil moisture response function, and W is the soil moisture\nfraction of saturation. Rg increases exponentially with soil\ntemperature assuming Q10 = 2.4 [Raich and Schlesinger,\n1992]. Rg increases with soil moisture to an optimum value\nthen decreases (i.e., too much water and oxygen availability\nlimits microbial growth) [Raich et al, 1991]. The optimal\nsoil moisture, Wopt, varies between 0.6 and 0.7, depending\non soil type. We calculate R* separately for each of six soil\nlayers and one layer of overlying litter.\n[13] To allow for the dependence of respiration rates on\ncarbon pool sizes, we assume photosynthesis and ecosystem\nrespiration are everywhere in close balance on an annual\ntimescale, but allow for perturbations due to interannual\nvariability to persist over a specified relaxation time. This is\nparameterized by releasing accumulated carbon over a\nperiod of time, weighted by the temperature and soil\nmoisture response functions. We chose a 1-year residence\ntime so that the carbon cycle at every model grid cell is\nnearly in balance, but that perturbations in photosynthesis in\none year are felt over the following year as perturbations in\necosystem respiration. Rf is the respiration rate that balances\nannual An when adjusted for soil temperature and water\ncontent:\nRf \u00bc\nP\n1year\nAn\nP\n1year\nR*\n: \u00f06\u00de\nWe divide the annual accumulated carbon among six soil\nlayers and one litter layer based on the fraction of total roots\nin each layer. We assume the root density decreases\nexponentially with depth with biome specific profiles from\nJackson et al. [1996]. We calculated a \u2018\u2018rolling\u2019\u2019 Rf each\nmonth based on the previous 12 months of An and R*.\n[14] Four climate variables influence NEE in SiB2: tem-\nperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and incident light.\nWe grouped them into those that effect GPP and those that\neffect R (Table 1). We listed precipitation and temperature\ntwice because they affect both GPP and R. The SiB2\nvariables representing each climate variable change with\nthe ECMWF weather data (which represents boundary layer\nvalues above the canopy), but also respond to changes in\nGPP and R and depend on the physical characteristics of the\ncanopy and soil. For example, leaf surface humidity depends\non plant transpiration, boundary layer humidity, and sensible\nheat flux. The influence of precipitation on GPP is limited to\nroot zone soil moisture stress (i.e., drought stress).\n[15] GPP and R also depend on the amount of biomass.\nLAI represents the above ground biomass and is prescribed\nvia the input NDVI. The rolling Rf represents the effect of\nshort-term variation in below ground biomass due to varia-\ntions in GPP. We neglected the influence of LAI on auto-\ntrophic canopy respiration (RC), since it rarely exceeds 5% of\nR and exerts only a 0.3% influence on NEE variability.\n[16] To quantify how climate influences NEE variability,\nwe calculated reference rates for GPP and R for each climate\nvariable and compared them to the actual rate. We defined a\nclimate variable influence as:\nEi \u00bc GPPi \u0004 GPPj j or Ei \u00bc Ri \u0004 Rj j; \u00f07\u00de\nwhere Ei is the influence and GPPi and Ri are reference rates\nfor the ith climate variable. When a climate variable does\nnot influence NEE, Ei = 0. For example, if GPP is Rubisco\n(nitrogen) limited and the light level increases, EPAR = 0\nsince increased light would not affect GPP. The absolute\nvalue ensures nonnegative monthly averages of Ei. All Ei\nwere calculated each time step and have units of flux.\nTable 1. Climate Factors, SiB2 Variables, and Associated\nReference Values\nClimate Factor Group SiB2 Variable Reference Value\nHumidity GPP leaf surface relative humidity 1.0\nLight GPP PAR incident on canopy top 200 W m\u00042\nLeaf Area Index GPP Leaf Area Index LAImax\nTemperature GPP canopy temperature 298.15 K\nPrecipitation GPP root zone soil water fraction 1.0\nTemperature R root zone soil temperature 298 K\nPrecipitation R root zone soil water fraction Wopt\nSoil carbon R respiration factor Rfmean\nSCHAEFER ET AL.: CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND TERRESTRIAL CO2 FLUXES 49 - 3\n[17] To calculate the reference rate (GPPi or Ri) for each\nEi, we kept all inputs the same and changed the ith climate\nfactor to a reference value as listed in Table 1. As humidity\ndecreases, stomata close to minimize water loss, reducing\nGPP (i.e., humidity stress), so we chose the optimal humid-\nity value of 1.0. For LAI, we chose the maximum possible\nLAI for each biome [Sellers et al., 1996b]. For precipitation\ninfluence on GPP, we chose fully saturated soil (W = 1.0).\nFor precipitation influence on R, we chose the optimal soil\nwater content for maximum heterotrophic respiration, Wopt\n[Raich et al., 1991]. For temperature influence on GPP and\nR, we chose reference values as identified in Sellers et al.\n[1996a]. For PAR we chose a typical saturated value (the\ncanopy usually absorbs more light than it can use for\nphotosynthesis). For soil carbon, we chose an average\nrespiration factor, Rfmean, based on the mean seasonal\nvariation of An and R* (defined below).\n[18] To assure Ei scales properly with GPP or R, (i.e., Ei is\nsmall when GPP is small and large when GPP is large), we\ncalculated weighted monthly averages:\nEi \u00bc GPP \u0007 Ei\nGPP\nor Ei \u00bc R \u0007 Ei\nR\n; \u00f08\u00de\nwhere the overbar represents a monthly average. The\nweighted monthly average influence, Ei, measures the\nsensitivity of GPP and R (and thus NEE) to changes in\nthe ith climate variable.\n[19] We calculated the mean seasonal variation from\nglobal maps of monthly averages by averaging all Januaries,\nFebruaries, etc. This resulted in 12 global maps (one for\neach month) representing the mean seasonal variation.\nSubtracting mean seasonal variation maps from monthly\naverage maps produced monthly anomaly maps:\nX 0 \u00bc X \u00bc eX ; \u00f09\u00de\nwhere X 0 is the monthly anomaly for variable X, X is the\nmonthly mean of X, and eX is the seasonal variation of X.\nFrom the anomaly maps, we produced maps of standard\ndeviation, correlation, and other statistical parameters.\nMultiplying by grid cell area (which varies with latitude)\nand adding all land pixels produced total global land fluxes\nas a function of time.\n3. NEE Variability\n[20] The global land-surface NEE (GtC year\u00041) shows a\nstrong seasonal variation driven by vegetation in the North-\nern Hemisphere (Figure 1). The Northern Hemisphere has\nmore land and vegetation than the Southern Hemisphere and\ndominates the global NEE seasonal cycle. NEE is most\nstrongly negative during the Northern Hemisphere summer\nwhen global GPP is greatest. NEE is most strongly positive\nin Northern Hemisphere fall when assimilation drops off\nand global R dominates. The secondary minimum in\nNovember results from the surge in global GPP in the\nSouthern Hemisphere spring. The NEE averages to zero\nover many years. However, small changes in GPP and R\neach year result in interannual NEE variability of about \u00b12\nGtC year\u00041.\n[21] The simulated global NEE anomaly (GtC year\u00041) as\na function of time (Figure 2) captures most of the salient\nfeatures of the measured global CO2 growth rate extrapo-\nlated from flask measurements [Conway et al., 1994]. The\nsimulated NEE standard deviation (1.3 GtC year\u00041) com-\npares well with Conway et al. [1994] (1.1 GtC year\u00041) and\nHoughton [2000] (1.0 GtC year\u00041). The peaks and valleys\nroughly line up, but a 12-month running mean NEE shows\nonly a weak correlation of 0.27 with the observed CO2\ngrowth rate. The simulated NEE lags behind the observed\nCO2 growth rate by 2\u20133 months because we did not include\ntransport from the terrestrial sources to the flask measure-\nment sites. Accounting for transport lag only increases the\ncorrelation to 0.3 because the observed CO2 growth rate\naccounts for variability in ocean fluxes, biomass burning,\nand fossil fuel emissions while we do not. Still, the\nFigure 1. The Northern Hemisphere (NH) controls the\nseasonal changes in the simulated global NEE. Negative\nNEE spikes every June represent NH summer (GPP\ndominates NEE). The positive peak every September\nrepresents NH fall (respiration dominates NEE). The\nsecondary minimum in November represents Southern\nHemisphere (SH) spring. The annual NEE is near zero,\nbut varies slightly year to year.\nFigure 2. A 12-month running mean of the simulated\nglobal NEE anomalies captures the salient features and\nvariability seen in anomalies of the measured global CO2\ngrowth rate.\n49 - 4 SCHAEFER ET AL.: CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND TERRESTRIAL CO2 FLUXES\nsimulated NEE anomaly agrees fairly well with the global\nland flux estimates of McGuire et al. [2001] using several\nbiogeochemical models, Bousquet et al. [2000] from inver-\nsion of flask measurements with a transport model, and\nKaduk and Heimann [1997] from the long-term Mona Loa\nrecord.\n[22] Some error in our simulated NEE may result from\ninaccuracies in NDVI estimates for tropical forests, which\ncover only 9% of the land surface, but account for 30% of\nglobal NEE. Spatial and temporal interpolation of NDVI\ndata to account for persistent cloud cover over tropical\nforests artificially smooth LAI estimates, making it more\ndifficult to predict year-to-year variations [Los et al., 2000].\nThe CO2 growth rate may not accurately account for land\nfluxes because the flask measurements sample predomi-\nnantly marine rather than terrestrial air. Assuming a uniform\n1-year turnover time introduces error into our NEE esti-\nmates since different biome types actually have different\nturnover times. Different turnover times for different biome\ntypes would change the timing of respiration anomalies,\nalthough the overall respiration variability would not\nchange. Other sources of error include approximations in\nSiB2.\n[23] A map of NEE standard deviation (Figure 3) shows\nthat tropical grasslands in South America and Africa have\nthe highest interannual variability followed by northern\nextratropical forests. Equatorial rain forests have fairly\nlow variability except for the western half of the Amazon\nbasin. The large South American anomaly results from\nprecipitation variability from El Nin\u02dco-Southern Oscillation\n(ENSO) and potential problems with the ECMWF precip-\nitation data (see below). Although deserts are highly vari-\nable relative to their seasonal amplitude, low GPP results in\nlow NEE standard deviations.\n[24] Variability in the Northern extratropics is not as\nspatially uniform as implied in Figure 3. A typical map of\nsimulated NEE anomalies for July 1984 (Figure 4) shows a\npattern of alternating positive and negative regions across\nthe Northern Hemisphere. The amplitudes of these simu-\nlated NEE anomalies range from 0.2 to 0.4 GtC yr\u00041 and are\ncomparable to annual net carbon fluxes estimated from\ninversions of CO2 flask measurements [e.g., Bousquet et\nal., 2000; Pacala et al., 2001]. The anomaly periods of 2\u20133\nyears are consistent with the 100% interannual variability\nseen by Pacala et al. [2001] in their estimates of the North\nAmerican carbon sink. These regional anomalies tend to\ncancel, negating the effect of much greater land area in the\nNorthern Hemisphere. While the Northern Hemisphere\ndominates the global NEE seasonal cycle, the tropics\ndominate global NEE interannual variability.\n4. Climate Influences\n[25] NEE anomalies depend on the relative magnitude of\nGPP and R anomalies because both respond in similar ways\nto climate and tend to cancel each other. For example, for a\ngiven soil water content, both GPP and R tend to increase\nwith temperature. A climate anomaly will produce an NEE\nanomaly if either GPP or R responds more vigorously to\nclimate variability. The relative magnitude of GPP and R\nvariance measures how strongly they influence NEE inter-\nannual variability:\nor\nfGPP \u00bc s2GPP= s2GPP \u00fe s2R\n\u0003 \u0004\nfR \u00bc s2R= s2GPP \u00fe s2R\n\u0003 \u0004\n;\n\u00f010\u00de\nwhere fGPP and fR are the relative influences of GPP and R\non NEE interannual variability, sGPP and sR are the standard\ndeviations of GPP and sGPP2 and R, and sGPP2 and sR2 are the\nvariances of GPP and R. When fR = 0, respiration has no\ninfluence on NEE interannual variability; when fR = 1,\nrespiration totally controls NEE variability (by definition,\nfGPP = 1 \u2013 fR).\n[26] R dominates NEE variability at high latitudes\n(Figure 5) while GPP and R exert roughly equal influences\nin the highly variable tropical grasslands. Although GPP\nvariability almost totally controls the deserts, these regions\nhave such low GPP they do not significantly affect the\nglobal NEE interannual variability. Overall, R accounts for\n59% and GPP for 41% of the global NEE interannual\nvariability.\nFigure 3. A map of NEE standard deviation (mg C m\u00042\ns\u00041) indicates grasslands of South America and Africa have\nthe greatest interannual variability. The large anomaly in\nSouth America results from drought stress.\nFigure 4. A map of typical simulated NEE anomalies (mg\nC m\u00042 s\u00041) for July 1984 shows a pattern of alternating\npositive and negative regions across the Northern Hemi-\nsphere. These regional anomalies tend to cancel such that\nthe tropics dominate global NEE interannual variability.\nSCHAEFER ET AL.: CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND TERRESTRIAL CO2 FLUXES 49 - 5\n[27] Isolating the causes for these regional differences is\ndifficult because the climate variables are coupled and do\nnot vary independently of one another. Feedback between\nclimate variables often limits NEE variability. For exam-\nple, increasing canopy temperature increases GPP, but also\ndecreases relative humidity (which decreases GPP). Com-\nparing relative magnitudes of Ei variance accounts for\nsuch cancellation and feedback between climate factors.\nThe total influence of the GPP Ei group on NEE varia-\nbility cannot exceed the relative influence of GPP itself\nsuch that\nfi \u00bc s\n2\niP\ns2i\nfGPP\nor fi \u00bc s\n2\niP\ns2i\nfR;\nwhere fi is the interannual influence of the ith climate factor\nand si\n2 the variance of Ei. When fi = 0, the climate factor has\nno influence and when fi = 1, the climate factor totally\ncontrols NEE interannual variability. By definition, the sum\nof all fi for both the R and GPP groups equals one\u0003P\nfi \u00bc 1\n\u0004\n. Maps of fi show strong regional differences in\nthe influence of climate on NEE variability (Figure 6).\n[28] Precipitation control of GPP (Figure 6a) and R\n(Figure 6b) dominate throughout the tropics. The GPP\nand R precipitation influence patterns do not significantly\noverlap. The demarcation lies roughly where the average\nsoil moisture equals Wopt. This division is especially clear in\nregions with a strong spatial gradient in soil moisture (e.g.,\nsub-Saharan Africa and South America). The soil moisture\ninfluence on GPP represents drought stress. In semi-arid and\ndesert regions with drier soils (W < Wopt), precipitation\ncontrol of GPP dominates because respiration can occur\neven in very dry soils while GPP ceases below minimum\nsoil water content. In nearly saturated soils (W > Wopt),\nprecipitation changes effect respiration, but do not induce\ndrought stress, so precipitation control of R dominates. Tian\net al. [1998] saw a similar dependency in their simulation of\nNEE in the Amazon basin.\n[29] The large NEE anomaly in South America (Figure\n3) may result from problems with the ECMWF precip-\nitation data as well as naturally occurring drought stress.\nSpatial patterns of precipitation differ between datasets\nderived from rain gauge data and those from reanalysis\nusing a model [Costa and Foley, 1998]. Our simulated\nanomaly differs slightly from that simulated by Tian et al.\n[1998] because they used precipitation based on rain\ngauge data. The precipitation data from the ECMWF\nreanalysis is diagnostic and unconstrained by rain gauge\nmeasurements. The spectral representation of topography\nin ECMWF produces false undulations in the land surface,\ncreating potentially suspect precipitation anomalies in\nSouth America [Costa and Foley, 1998]. Bright NDVI\ndata may indicate plant growth, but the ECMWF may\nsystematically put the rain somewhere else, resulting in\ndrought stress.\n[30] Temperature influence on respiration dominates NEE\nvariability at high latitudes (Figure 6d). The temperature\nresponse function for R is exponential, so small soil temper-\nature anomalies can produce large R anomalies, especially\nduring peak temperatures in the summer. By contrast, GPP\nis relatively insensitive to temperature except at extreme\nhigh and low temperatures (Figure 6c). The resulting\ntemperature influence on GPP is very small and reflects\nvariability in temperature extremes at high latitudes, high\naltitudes, and deserts. Essentially, R goes up and down with\ntemperature relative to a more stable GPP.\n[31] LAI influences NEE interannual variability in trop-\nical grasslands, high-latitude forests and tundra (Figure\n6e). The LAI influence represents the indirect effect of\nclimate (precipitation, temperature, snow cover, etc.) on\nplant growth, probably when the ecosystem is most\nsensitive, such as spring [Houghton, 2000]. In general,\nsnow cover influences LAI in the high northern latitudes,\ntemperature in the midlatitudes, and a combination of\nprecipitation and temperature in the tropics [Los et al.,\n2001].\n[32] Soil carbon has a fairly evenly distributed influence\non NEE interannual variability, peaking at the equator and\ndecreasing toward the poles (Figure 6f). Like LAI, soil\ncarbon represents the indirect effects of climate on\nsoil organic matter due to GPP anomalies. The resulting soil\ncarbon anomalies last a year because of the assumed 1-year\nturnover time in the rolling respiration factor. Consequently,\nregions where GPP dominates NEE variability also show a\nstrong soil carbon influence.\n[33] Humidity shows a weak, but fairly uniform influence\non NEE interannual variability (Figure 6g). Transpiration\nduring photosynthesis generally keeps the leaf surface\nhumidity near saturation, making it insensitive to changes\nin ECMWF humidity (defined in the boundary layer above\nthe canopy). Humidity influences GPP only when high\nsensible heat flux mixes relatively dry boundary layer air\ndown into the canopy, reducing the humidity at the leaf\nsurface and causing humidity stress.\n[34] Although globally weak, PAR shows a fairly strong\nregional influence in equatorial tropical forests where per-\nsistent cloud cover reduces the light available for plant\ngrowth (Figure 6h). In SiB2, photosynthesis is light-limited\nFigure 5. A map of the relative influence of respiration on\nNEE interannual variability (0 means no influence, 1 means\ntotal control) indicates respiration dominates in high\nlatitudes. GPP and respiration exert roughly equal influence\nin the tropics. The relative influences of respiration and GPP\nare based on the relative magnitudes of their variances.\n(11)\n49 - 6 SCHAEFER ET AL.: CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND TERRESTRIAL CO2 FLUXES\nFigure 6. The relative influences of each climate factor on the simulated NEE interannual variability\nshow strong regional differences. The influences are based on relative magnitudes of variance for each\nclimate factor (0 means no influence, 1 means total control). Precipitation influence on GPP via soil\nmoisture dominates in tropical grasslands and deserts. Temperature influence on respiration dominates at\nhigh latitudes. LAI influence represents climate influences during plant growth. The incident light\ninfluences NEE variability only in regions of extensive rainfall. Soil carbon has the greatest influence in\nthe tropics. Humidity exerts a fairly uniform, but weak global influence.\nSCHAEFER ET AL.: CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND TERRESTRIAL CO2 FLUXES 49 - 7\nonly at low light levels in the early morning and late\nevening (PAR below about 100 W m\u00042). At other times,\nnitrogen or export capacity limit GPP. The length of time\neach day that GPP is light-limited determines the overall\ninfluence of PAR. Precipitation anomalies change the cloud\ncover and incident PAR, which determines the time each\nday when GPP is light-limited.\n[35] Because of the regional cancellation in the Northern\nHemisphere, precipitation in the tropics dominates the\nsimulated global NEE interannual variability seen in Figure\n2. Precipitation influence on GPP and R combined account\nfor 44% of the global NEE variability (precipitation influ-\nence on GPP accounts for 32% while precipitation influence\non R accounts for 12%). Variability in LAI and soil carbon\ncombined account for 35% of global NEE variability (23%\nand 12%, respectively). Overall humidity and PAR influen-\nces on global NEE variability are very weak (2% and 3%,\nrespectively). Temperature accounts for 16% of the global\nNEE interannual variability. The temperature influence on\nGPP is weak (1% globally). Despite dominating the North-\nern Hemisphere, regional cancellation reduces the global\ninfluence of temperature on respiration to 15% of the\nsimulated global NEE variability. Having quantified these\ninfluences, we examined in detail two climatic phenomena\nknown to effect interannual variability in temperature and\nprecipitation: the Arctic Oscillation and the El Nin\u02dco-South-\nern Oscillation.\n5. Arctic Oscillation and NEE Variability\n[36] The Arctic Oscillation (AO) is characterized by a\nnorth-south dipole in the strength of the zonal wind between\n35\u0001N and 55\u0001N [Thompson and Wallace, 2000, 2001].\nPositive AO polarity has stronger westerly winds north of\n45\u0001N and weaker winds south of 45\u0001N, which favors\nincreased advection of relatively warm oceanic air deep\ninto continental interiors. Negative AO polarity has weaker\nmean zonal flow and more blocking, pulling cold Arctic air\nmasses down into continental interiors. Positive AO polarity\nproduces positive temperature anomalies over land; nega-\ntive polarity produces negative anomalies. Since the AO\nprimarily influences the Northern Hemisphere and since\n50% of all Northern Hemisphere NEE anomalies occur in\nsummer, we focused our analysis on June\u2013July\u2013August\n(JJA).\n[37] Figure 7 shows summer (JJA) correlations of air\ntemperature and soil moisture with an AO index based on\nthe first principle mode of sea level pressure anomalies from\nthe NCEP reanalysis [Thompson and Wallace, 2000]. Figure\n8 shows JJA correlations of GPP, R, and NEE with the AO\nindex. The AO index, GPP, and temperature data show\npositive trends for 1983\u20131993 [Los, 1998; Thompson et al.,\n2000], which we removed prior to correlation. We omitted\ncorrelations failing the t-test at 95% significance [Devore,\n1995]. The degrees of freedom for the t-test are based on the\ntotal number of summer months in our simulation (assum-\ning each month is independent). Warm air advection asso-\nciated with positive AO polarity shows up as positive\ntemperature correlations in northern Europe, Canada, and\ncentral Asia. The reduced blocking associated with positive\nAO polarity deceases rainfall in the same regions, resulting\nin negative soil moisture correlations.\n[38] Figure 8 indicates the AO signal is strongest in\nnorthern Europe for GPP and R, but competing effects\nand cancellation result in weak AO correlations with\nNEE. As seen in Figure 6, several climate factors control\nNEE variability in Northern Europe: temperature (via GPP\nand R), LAI, precipitation (via R), and humidity. Decreased\nR due to reduced soil moisture partially cancels increased R\ndue to higher temperatures. Decreased GPP due to increased\nhumidity stress partially cancels increased GPP due to\nwarmer temperatures. The result is modest positive AO\ncorrelations with R and GPP. While both GPP and R\nincrease with temperature, R responds more vigorously.\nThe GPP anomalies partially cancel the R anomalies,\nresulting in weak positive NEE correlations. Similar can-\ncellation occurs in Canada and central Asia resulting in even\nweaker NEE correlations with the AO. Correlations scat-\ntered throughout the Southern Hemisphere are probably\nrandom associations and do not reflect direct influence by\nthe AO.\n[39] Overall, temperature effects from the AO dominate\nover precipitation effects. The limited spatial extent of the\nAO influence combined with cancellation effects result in a\nvery weak AO signal in the NEE variability in summer. The\nFigure 7. The Arctic Oscillation (AO) advects warm\noceanic air into continental interiors, resulting in positive\ntemperature and negative soil moisture correlations in\nnorthern Europe, central Canada and central Asia. We\nfocused on June\u2013July\u2013August (JJA) because 50% of all\nNorthern Hemisphere NEE anomalies occur in the summer.\nSouthern Hemisphere correlations probably do not reflect\ndirect AO influence.\n49 - 8 SCHAEFER ET AL.: CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND TERRESTRIAL CO2 FLUXES\nAO can explain part of the strong temperature influence\nacross the Northern Hemisphere and the Northern Europe\nportion of the simulated spatial pattern for NEE, but not the\n2\u20133 year cycle in NEE variability.\n6. ENSO and NEE Variability\n[40] El Nin\u02dco-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is character-\nized by weaker or stronger trade winds in the equatorial\nPacific. Weaker trade winds (El Nin\u02dco) cut off cold-water\nupwelling off of South America and shift the Pacific warm\nwater pool from off Asia eastward to the central Pacific.\nStrong trade winds (La Nin\u02dca) push the Pacific warm pool\nwestward toward Australia. El Nin\u02dco and La Nin\u02dca are the\nextremes of alternating sea level pressures between east and\nwest Pacific known as the Southern Oscillation. The Pacific\nwarm pool moving with ENSO has a domino effect, shifting\nrainfall and temperature patterns around the globe [Green et\nal., 1997]. ENSO has a period of 2\u20137 years. Our simulation\ncovered two El Nin\u02dco events and part of a third (1982\u20131983,\n1986\u20131987, and 1991\u20131992) and two La Nin\u02dca events\n(1984\u20131985, 1988\u20131989).\n[41] Figure 9 shows correlations of air temperature and\nsoil moisture with a Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) based\non the sea level pressure difference between Tahiti and\nDarwin for 1983\u20131993. We removed trends and omitted\ncorrelations failing the t-test at 95% significance. Negative\nSOI corresponds to El Nin\u02dco; positive SOI corresponds to La\nNin\u02dca. Negative correlations mean increases during El Nin\u02dco;\npositive correlations mean decreases during El Nin\u02dco.\n[42] Rainfall patterns throughout the tropics shift as the\nPacific warm pool moves east and west with ENSO. For\nexample, rainfall (and thus soil moisture) in Australia drops\nduring El Nin\u02dco as the Pacific warm pool moves to the east,\nresulting in positive SOI correlations. Decreased rainfall\nreduces cloud cover, increases solar heating, and reduces\nevaporative cooling [Kaduk and Heimann, 1997], which\nincreases temperature and produces negative SOI correla-\ntions. Temperature is fairly constant in the tropics, so\nalthough the correlations appear strong, the effect is small.\nIn East Russia, reduced cloud cover associated with reduced\nprecipitation during El Nin\u02dco increases radiative cooling,\ndecreasing temperatures and producing positive SOI corre-\nlations. In summary, ENSO primarily affects global precip-\nitation and soil moisture patterns and weakly influences\ntemperature.\n[43] The effects of shifting rainfall patterns on GPP and R\ncan cancel (Figure 10). For example, in Australia and India,\nboth R and GPP show positive correlations with SOI (both\nFigure 8. Respiration and GPP anomalies often cancel,\nresulting in very weak correlations between the Arctic\nOscillation (AO) and NEE. The strongest AO signal is in\nNorthern Europe. Southern Hemisphere correlations prob-\nably do not reflect direct AO influence.\nFigure 9. Correlations with a Southern Oscillation Index\nindicate ENSO strongly influences global precipitation\npatterns, especially in the tropics.\nSCHAEFER ET AL.: CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND TERRESTRIAL CO2 FLUXES 49 - 9\ndecrease as precipitation drops during El Nin\u02dco). Precipita-\ntion controls NEE variability for Australia and India (Fig-\nures 6a and 6b). Areas controlled by drought stress show\nnegative NEE correlations (R > GPP during El Nin\u02dco). Areas\ncontrolled by soil moisture for respiration show positive\nNEE correlations (R < GPP during El Nin\u02dco). Zero NEE\ncorrelations indicate the R and GPP anomalies cancel.\n[44] The large NEE anomaly in South America (Figure 4)\nresults from drought stress due to rainfall shifting with\nENSO. The soil water content relative to the optimum for\nrespiration, Wopt, drives the spatial pattern of this anomaly.\nThe average soil water content exceeds Wopt in the Amazon\nbasin and decreases southward and westward to less than\nWopt in the highlands of central and western South America.\nDuring El Nin\u02dco, rainfall shifts from the Amazon basin and\ncentral South America to the west and southeast. The soil\nwater in the Amazon basin decreases and respiration\nincreases, but GPP is not affected, resulting negative corre-\nlations for R and NEE, but weak correlations for GPP. In the\ncentral South American highlands, the soil water is less than\nWopt, so decreased rain during El Nin\u02dco reduces R and\nintroduces drought stress, resulting in positive R and GPP\ncorrelations. Drought stress coupled with possible problems\nwith the ECMWF precipitation data (described above)\nproduce a highly variable NEE anomaly, but partial can-\ncellation between GPP and R weakens the NEE correlation\nwith ENSO.\n[45] The ENSO influence above 30\u0001N is weak. Temper-\nature variability due to ENSO shows up as a strong\ncorrelation with R in east Russia. The high values of LAI\ninfluence on NEE variability (Figure 6g) and corresponding\nhigh soil moisture correlations indicate ENSO influences\nsnow cover, melting times, and spring plant growth [Kaduk\nand Heimann, 1997; Los et al., 2001] in Europe and\nCanada. This may partly explain the simulated NEE anom-\naly pattern in the Northern Hemisphere. However, ENSO\ndoes not explain the strong temperature influence across the\nNorthern Hemisphere or the 2\u20133 year cycle in NEE\nvariability.\n[46] Overall, ENSO primarily affects NEE variability in\nthe tropics through changes in precipitation, explaining\nmuch of the NEE variability simulated in South America,\nAfrica, and Asia. While our correlations are statistically\nsignificant at 95% assuming each month is independent, our\nsimulation covers only three ENSO cycles. Our results are\nconsistent with that expected from ENSO, but a more\nrigorous analysis requires simulations of several decades.\n7. Conclusions\n[47] The global NEE from our simulation captured the\nsalient features of the observed global CO2 growth rate. The\ndetailed process information and high time resolution in\nSiB2 allowed us to isolate and quantify the influences of\nclimate on global and regional interannual variability of\nNEE. Further, using remotely sensed LAI we estimated the\noverall influence of plant biomass on GPP variability.\nAssuming a 1-year turnover time we estimated the effect\nof below ground biomass on respiration variability. Using\nbiome specific turnover times would improve the timing of\nrespiration anomalies. Adding an ocean model would\nimprove the match with the observed CO2 growth rate.\nExplicitly tracking various carbon and nitrogen pools would\nisolate the effects of land use, growing season length,\nnitrogen availability, and other factors that influence NEE\ninterannual variability.\n[48] The tropical grasslands in South America and Africa\nshow the highest NEE variability. The large South Ameri-\ncan NEE anomaly is driven by shifting precipitation with\nENSO, but may also result, in part, from ECMWF precip-\nitation errors. The simulated NEE in the Northern Hemi-\nsphere shows a pattern of alternating positive and negative\nanomalies with periods of 2\u20133 years and amplitudes con-\nsistent with inversions of CO2 flask measurements. The\nalternating anomalies tend to cancel such that the tropics\ncontrol global NEE interannual variability while the North-\nern Hemisphere controls the global NEE seasonal cycle.\n[49] Because of cancellation and competing effects, no\nsingle climate variable controls global or regional NEE\ninterannual variability. Precipitation exerts the greatest\nFigure 10. Correlations with a Southern Oscillation Index\nindicate ENSO influences NEE variability primarily in the\ntropics, consistent with expected shifts in precipitation.\n49 - 10 SCHAEFER ET AL.: CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND TERRESTRIAL CO2 FLUXES\ninfluence (44% of global NEE variability), followed by\nLAI (23%), temperature (16%), and soil carbon (12%).\nHumidity and available light do not strongly influence\nglobal NEE variability. Climate influences have strong\nregional differences: temperature influence on respiration\ndominates in the extratropics while precipitation influence\non GPP and R dominates in the tropics. For regions\ncontrolled by precipitation the soil water content relative\nto Wopt determines whether GPP or R controls NEE\nvariability. In dry soils (W < Wopt), GPP dominates; in\nwet soils (W > Wopt), R dominates.\n[50] The influence of ENSO on NEE variability is con-\nsistent with that expected for shifting precipitation patterns\nin the tropics, especially for the large South American\nanomaly. A definitive assessment requires a longer time\nrecord, since our simulation covered only three ENSO\ncycles. Except in northern Europe, temperature advection\nby the AO does not significantly influence NEE variability.\nNeither the AO nor ENSO fully explain the temperature\ninfluence on respiration or the simulated NEE anomaly\npattern in the Northern Hemisphere.\n[51] Acknowledgments.
