It\nis used in many countries to kill broad-leaved weeds and also to control vegetation\nand algae in farm ponds, fish hatcheries, swimming pools, fountains, ornamental fish\nponds and water-recirculating cooling towers. Although the PAN Pesticide Database\n(http:\/\/www.pesticideinfo.org\/Index.html) informs that in some concentrations\nsimazine might be toxic to fish and aquatic ecosystems, simazine is generally\nconsidered as non-toxic for most species [1, 2]. Although EU directives have banned\nthe use of simazine on non-cropped land, its use is still permitted on cropped land and\nin ornamental water (ponds, aquariums) [3]. According to available literature,\nsimazine is effective at controlling unicellular and attached filamentous algae at a\nconcentration of 0.1- 1 milligrams per litre (mg L-1) [2, 4].\nIt is well known that it is extremely difficult to keep pond water in good\ncondition. During the spring when the temperature goes above 10 \u00baC the water\nbecomes green due to uncontrolled growth of different types of algae (Fig. 1). There\nare many commercial products which can be used for algae control and most of these\nproducts have simazine or 2-chloro-4,6-bis (ethylamino)-s-triazine as the only active\ningredient. These products are available in liquid, tablet or powder form. It is\nrecommended to add simazine products regularly to the water in order to keep it clear\nfrom filamentous (blanket weed) and unicellular algae. Unfortunately, simazine\nadministration in this way is labour intensive, time-consuming and also has one\nimportant additional drawback in that it results in fluctuation of the simazine\nconcentration. This could lead on the one hand to uncontrolled algae growth and on\nthe other, irreversible damage to other organisms or whole ecosystems. The\nrecommendations of the commercial producers tend to underestimate the working\nconcentration of simazine and go for a maximum soluble level, which corresponds to\n3.5- 5 mg L-1. An innovative solution is required in order to find a user-friendly,\nsimple and controlled method of simazine administration. The ideas presented in this\npaper work toward this by the design of a specific molecularly imprinted polymer\n(MIP), which could release the template at required rate.\nMolecular imprinting technology is known as a method of preparation of\nspecific recognition sites by formation the complex between template and functional\nmonomers [5]. The molecular complex between template and functional monomers is\npreserved using excess of polymerisable cross-linker. Thermal or photochemical\ninitiated polymerization produces a highly cross-linked insoluble polymer. The\nextraction of the template from the MIP creates cavities in the matrix, which are\ncomplementary in both shape and chemical functionality to those of the template.\nTraditional fields of MIPs application include separation [6-8], synthesis and catalysis\n[9, 10] and sensors [11, 12]. These applications are mainly based on the selective\nadsorption characteristics of molecular imprinted polymers.\nThe application of desorption properties of MIPs is a relatively new area.\nEarly studies delivered promising results that showed that these affinity materials\ncould be used for controlled delivery of drugs [13-15]. Although molecular imprinting\ntechnology has a potential for creating custom-made carriers for variety of chemicals\nand biomolecules, intensive development and optimisation is necessary in order to\nbring the controlled release application into practice. Among the features, which\nshould be included in a \u201cdial-the-MIP\u201d protocol, is the rational selection of the\nfunctional monomers, polymer format and increasing the polymer capacity.\nIn this paper, a feasibility study on the possibility of using a simazine-specific\nmolecularly imprinted polymer for controlled release of simazine into water is\ndescribed. As far as we know, it is the first report on the application of MIPs for\nsustained release of herbicides into the environment.\n2. Material and methods\n2.1. Materials\nAcetonitrile, dimethyl formamide (DMF), water (all HPLC grade), ethylene\nglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), 1,1-azobis (cyclohexanecarbonitrile), MA were\npurchased from Sigma (UK). HEM was purchased from Aldrich (UK). Simazine was\npurchased from Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn (Fluka, UK).\n2.2. Molecular modelling of monomer-template interactions\nIn order to simulate the monomers\/template interactions a Silicon Graphics\nOctane running an IRIX 6.7 operating system and software package SYBYL 6.9\n(Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) was used. The structure of charged simazine was\nminimised to the value of 0.001 kcal mol-1 and was screened against a library of 20\npolymerisable functional monomers [6]. The Leapfrog algorithm was used to analyse\nthe possible interactions between the template and functional monomers. The program\nwas applied for 30,000 iterations and the results of these were examined and the\nempirical binding energy score evaluated. This Leapfrog screening produced the list\nof functional monomers sorted depending on strength of their interactions with\ntemplate. The monomer with highest the binding energy (MA) and the monomer with\nthe lowest binding energy (HEM) were selected for polymer preparation and further\ntesting.\n2.3. Polymer synthesis\nThe compositions of the imprinted polymers are described in Table 1. The\nprepared polymer mixture was split into 500-\u00b5l aliquots, which were placed in 1.5-ml\nplastic centrifuge tubes with screw caps containing O-rings (Starlab, Germany). The\npolymers were prepared by thermo-polymerisation in a silicon oil bath at 80 \u00baC for 12\nhours. The resultant polymer monoliths were removed and used without grinding.\nHEM-based blank polymer was prepared in the same way as the MIP, but in the\nabsence of template.\n2.4. Release studies of simazine in water\nIn order to monitor the polymer performance, a single polymer monolith was\nplaced in 1 L of distilled water and shaken gently using a KS 250 B shaker (IKA,\nGermany). The water was exchanged completely every second day.\n2.5. Quantification of simazine in solution\nThe quantification of simazine was performed using Waters HPLC in tandem\nwith a bench-top triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass Quatro Micro,\nWaters, UK) equipped with an electrospray probe. The values of the voltages applied\nto the sampling cone (40 V), capillary (3.2 V), extractor (1 V) and collision cell (20\neV) were optimised by continuous infusion in order to achieve the highest possible\nsensitivity for simazine. The electrospray probe was maintained at +350 \u00b0C with a\nspray voltage of 450 V for positive ionization mode. The electron multiplier was set at\n650 V.\nHPLC-MS-MS analyses were carried out in MRM mode, where one daughter\nfragment (124 m\/z) was monitored. The HPLC conditions were: mobile phase A-\nwater, mobile phase B- acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% acetic acid, flow rate- 0.2\nml\/min, column- Luna 3 \u00b5m, i.d.- 3 mm, length- 50 mm (Phenomenex, UK). The\nmobile phase protocol was next: 0-10 min- gradient of solution B from 35 % to 100 %\nand 10-15 min post-run at 35% of solution B. The quantification was performed using\nMassLynx software and the peak of simazine with tR= 4.97 min was quantified.\n2.6. Kinetic study of simazine release\nThe kinetic study of simazine release from HEM-based polymers was\nconducted by placing a single polymer monolith in 1 L of distilled water, which was\nshaken gently, by a mechanical shaker. In this kinetic study the water was not\nexchanged and simazine concentration was measured every second day, using the\nmethod described above.\n2.7. Study of MIP and Blank polymers for re-adsorption and release of simazine\nHEM-based MIP and Blank polymers were synthesised as described earlier.\nThe 300-mg monoliths were placed into Soxhlet extractor and washed with methanol\nfor 12 h (approximately 100 washing cycles). The quality of washing was monitored\nby HPLC-MS-MS using the quantification method described above. Washed polymer\nmonoliths were incubated in the sealed vials containing 10 ml of 0.5 mg mL-1 of\nsimazine in methanol or 10 ml of 4 mg mL-1 of simazine in DMF, for 3 days at room\ntemperature. Monoliths were transferred into 1 L of water and simazine release was\nmonitored as it was described in sections 2.4 and 2.5.\n3. Results and discussion\n3.1. Computer-aided design of MIP for simazine\nA molecular model of simazine was designed. The structure was drawn,\ncharged and then minimised to a value of 0.01 kcal mol-1. The molecule of simazine\nwas screened against of the virtual library of functional monomers using Leapfrog\nalgorithm resulting in tables, which rank the monomers with the highest binding\nscore.\nCharged MA was found to possess the strongest affinity towards charged\nsimazine (binding energy- 33.89 kcal mol-1). Hydrogen bonds defined the molecular\ncomplex between positively charged nitrogen of simazine molecule and negatively\ncharged carboxylic group of methacrylic acid (Fig. 1). HEM was chosen from the\nLeapfrog table as an example of a functional monomer with relatively weak affinity to\nsimazine (binding energy- 11.93 kcal mol-1). The molecular complex was formed by\ninteractions between the hydroxyl group of neutral HEM and the triazine ring of\nsimazine (Fig. 2). This one-point interaction could be considered as much weaker than\nthe interaction between MA and simazine, which would correlate to Leapfrog\u2019s\nbinding score.\nThe binding energy of the cross-linker (EGDMA), which does not possess any\nfunctional groups, was negligible (<-0.04 kcal mol-1). The polymer without functional\nmonomers was made in order to prove that functional monomers were needed in order\nto control the template release.\nAccording to the results from Leapfrog, it was possible to recommend\nsynthesis and testing of the following polymers (Table 1):\nMIP1 (MA-polymer) - molar ratio 1:5 simazine: MA\nMIP2 (HEM-polymer) - molar ratio 1:10 simazine: HEM\nMIP 3 (EGDMA-polymer) - no monomers, only cross-linker\n3.2 Quantification of simazine in solution\nThe experiment was conducted as described in the Material and Methods. The\nfragmentation was achieved in positive ionization mode. Multiple reaction monitoring\n(MRM) of simazine daughter fragment 124 m\/z was performed (Fig. 3). The retention\ntime of simazine was 4.97 min (Fig. 3). The calibration standards of simazine in the\nrange from 1-100 ng mL-1 were prepared and injected. The concentration of simazine\nwas calculated accordingly to calibration curves using MassLynx software. Samples\nwhich were expected to have higher simazine concentration than range covered by\ncalibration curve (as for EGDMA- polymer), were diluted with water and the\nquantified concentration was multiplied by the dilution coefficient.\n3.3. Release of simazine from MIP monoliths\nThe results of the simazine release showed a good correlation with molecular\nmodelling. The MA- based polymer demonstrated strong binding towards the\ntemplate and very slow and steady release of simazine into the water (Fig. 4). The\ntotal amount of simazine released over 25 days was calculated as 0.35 mg. Although\nthis polymer could be very good for adsorption of simazine (for example, for solid-\nphase extraction (SPE) or sensor work) under the specified conditions desorption\nproperties would not be satisfactory for application of the polymer as a carrier of\nherbicide.\nThe HEM- based polymer demonstrated lower affinity and released simazine\nmuch quicker than MA- based polymer and this correlated with its Leapfrog binding\nenergy (Fig. 4). At the same time, herbicide release was steady and produced a higher\nsimazine concentration in the water, which would be sufficient for practical\napplication. The HEM-based MIP released 10 times more simazine than MA-based\nMIP. In total, 3.5 mg of simazine were released from 300-mg HEM-based MIP in 25\ndays. The comparison of simazine desorption from two polymers correlated with the\nprediction given by computational modelling and demonstrated that using a rational\napproach to MIP design could help identify a polymer (or a mixture of polymers) with\na required rate of desorption.\nThe EGDMA-based polymer was prepared without any functional monomer\nand as expected, the release of simazine was the largest and quickest of all the\npolymers (Fig. 4). During the first week, almost all the simazine was released from\nEGDMA-based polymer producing a solution with high concentration (at one point\nup to 2 mg L-1). In total, the EDGMA- based polymer released 5.2 mg of simazine in\n13 days. It was possible to draw the conclusion that the presence of a functional\nmonomer which interacts with the template is required in order to generate a polymer\nwith sufficient affinity to allow the retention of the template and to provide a\nsustainable release of the herbicide for compensation of natural loses. EGDMA\nshowed negligible interactions with the template and its release was too fast for a\npotential practical application.\nThe results demonstrated that by changing the make-up of the polymer we\nwere able to control the rate of release of the template into the solution. The\ncomputational approach can be used to design a polymer with a programmable release\npattern of the template into environment.\nIt was observed that during first week the template release from the polymer\nwas much higher than during following days. This tendency could be a consequence\nof the polymer swelling in water, which caused a release of the template from the\nsurface and some less specific binding sites.\n3.4. Kinetics\nThe HEM-based polymer was selected as the best candidate for practical\napplication; therefore the kinetics of simazine release from HEM-based polymers was\nstudied. A 300-mg polymer monolith was placed in 1 L of distilled water on the\nmechanical shaker. The water was not exchanged and the simazine concentration was\nmeasured every 2-3 days. The resulting curve showed that the saturation point was\nachieved after 3 weeks and corresponded to simazine solubility in water (Fig. 5). It is\nworth mentioning that right from the beginning of the period, the quantity of simazine\nreleased from HEM- MIP would be sufficient to protect the water from algae growth.\n3.5. Evaluation of the simazine re-loading and release\nThe idea of this experiment was to compare the simazine release from unwashed MIP\nwith simazine release from washed and then re-loaded MIP and blank polymers.\nHEM-based MIP and blank polymer monoliths were thoroughly washed in a Soxhlet\nextractor in order to remove the template. The mass-spectrometry measurements\nshowed that no simazine was released from the MIP after Soxhlet extraction, which\nsuggested that simazine was removed completely. In order to load the polymer with\nsimazine, polymer blocks (about 300 mg each) were incubated in 10 mL of 0.5 mg\nmL-1 of simazine dissolved in methanol. The simazine concentration in the loading\nsolution was determined by its maximum solubility in methanol. The experiment\nshowed that the quantity of simazine released from loaded polymers (0.2 mg from\nMIP and 0.12 mg from blank polymer) was approximately 20 times lower that\nreleased from unwashed MIP. Most likely it was dependant on the amount of\nsimazine which was adsorbed on the polymer. Due to better adsorption of simazine by\nMIP in comparison with the blank polymer, the amount of released simazine from re-\nloaded MIP was larger than from blank polymer, but still much lower than from\nunwashed MIP. Another attempt at loading was made using DMF solution of\nsimazine, which was prepared with a higher simazine concentration of 4 mg mL-1\n(simazine has greater solubility in DMF as compared with methanol). The polymer\nwas incubated with simazine solution in DMF for 3 days. Then the polymer was\ntransferred into water and simazine release was monitored. It was found that despite\nthe larger quantity of simazine adsorbed from DMF solution than from methanol (Fig.\n6), the total quantity of the simazine released into water was still lower than from\nunwashed MIP. In total only 0.4 mg of simazine was released from MIP and 0.33 mg\nfrom the blank polymer. The comparison between MIP and blank polymers showed\nthat the MIP always had higher affinity towards simazine than blank polymer, as a\nresult of imprinting effect. Based on the observations described above it would be\npossible to draw a conclusion that the most effective way of introducing template into\nthe polymer was to prepare the imprinted polymer in the usual way whereby template\nis mixed with functional monomers and cross-linker and the polymer mixture is\npolymerised. The molecular complexation between the template and the rationally\nselected functional monomers would also allow the introduction of higher\nconcentrations of the template into the polymer than would be possible by physical\nadsorption.\nIt was important to find out if components of the polymer mixture other than\nsimazine could be released into the water from unwashed polymer. The list of\nmonitored compounds includes functional monomer (HEM), cross-linker (EGDMA)\nand solvent (DMF). One monolith of the blank polymer (300 mg) was placed into 1 L\nof de-ionised water which was changed every 24 h. The aliquot of the solution was\nfiltered and its spectrum was measured and analysed. It was found that no traces of\nHEM and EGDMA were detected in the first wash, which suggested the\npolymerisation was effective. As was expected, a large quantity of DMF was present\nin the first wash, but this had already reduced significantly (up to 100 times) in the\nsecond wash. A short wash of the polymer with water would be sufficient to remove\nthe majority of the solvent molecules from the porous polymeric material. It is also\nimportant to highlight that DMF has relatively low toxicity and its presence in minor\nquantities would not pose a threat to the environment.\nAnother observation from the experiment was that polymer monoliths were\nquite fragile and rigid, especially after washing in the Soxhlet extractor. For practical\napplication it might be necessary to incorporate the herbicide-containing polymer\nparticles into polymer composites for better strength and robustness or to grind them\ninto a particle format that could be used within a container. Naturally, the increased\nsurface area resulting would have to be taken into account with respect to the release\nkinetics.\nConclusions\nThese results demonstrate for the first time the possibilities of using molecular\nimprinted polymers for the controlled release of herbicides into water environments\nsuch as ponds and aquaria. An optimal rate of herbicide release can be achieved by\ncontrolling the amount of polymer and the composition of the MIP. The application of\nsimazine-contained polymer could provide a simple method of day-to-day protection\nof water without exposing the ecological system to excess simazine and the\nconsequential potential harm.\nAcknowledgements\nSP would like to acknowledge with gratitude receiving Royal Society-Wolfson\nResearch Merit Award.\nReferences\n[1] The Pesticide Manual. 8th Ed.
