There are\nmany views on insider trading and what to do about\nit; but we conclude \u2013 after extensive research and\ninterviews \u2013 that insider trading is an insignificant\nconsideration when comparing the volume of shares\ntraded and the level of insider knowledge utilised.\nThe issue is not insider trading, but rather how\ntraders can become better informed so as to\nenhance their trading capacity.\nWhat is insider trading? Generally the term is\nunderstood as the buying and selling of securities\non the basis of non-public, or privileged,\ninformation. Information is material that a\nreasonable investor is likely to consider as\nsignificant in making an investment decision,\nmaterial that, in turn, may have a substantial\nimpact on the market price of a company\u2019s\nsecurities. Non-public information refers to\ninformation that has not been disclosed to the\nmarketplace and investors have not had the\nopportunity to consider. To become public,\ninformation must be disseminated so that it is\nreasonably available to a broad array of investors.\nThe disclosure of information by a corporate insider\nto a select group (for example, analysts) is not\nsufficient to make that information public. We felt a\ndeeper study was needed to explore the wider\ndimensions of insider trading.\nThe data for this study was collected at three\ndifferent sites, the Vienna (VSE), London (LSE) and\nNew York (NYSE) Stock Exchanges during late\n2004 and early to mid-2005. The data was\nexclusively qualitative in nature using 54 semi-\nstructured interviews, each lasting about one hour.\nEach of the study participants represented\nregistered financial institutions.\nGrey matters\nOur research yielded four findings. The first was\nthat people define insider trading differently.\nParallel to the contrasting views on insider trading\nidentified in the literature, the study participants\nalso offered a range of interpretations of the\nsubject. Differences of view of insider trading did\nnot vary according to stock exchange location but by\nindividual. In sum, each interviewee either viewed\ninsider trading in a formal (legalistic) or in an\ninformal way.\nThirty out of the 34 Austrian and British\nparticipants defined insider trading in a formal\nmanner. Similarly, all 20 US participants initially\ndefined insider trading in a formal way. A\nrepresentative response comes from a VSE\ninterviewee: \u201cInsiders are people whose job gives\nthem access to confidential market-sensitive\ninformation; and, if they trade on it, it is insider\ntrading\u201d. For these interviewees, insider trading is\nas easy to perceive as whether a car is exceeding\nthe speed limit.\nEven so, the majority of participants viewed\ninsider trading as the grey area of finance. For\nexample, one VSE respondent said: \u201cTo be honest,\nit is such a grey area you can\u2019t draw a line and say\nthis is insider trading and this is not. I don\u2019t think\nyou can define insider trading. If someone wants to\nbuy shares and does not buy them on account of\ninsider information, such as bad news, in reality,\nalthough he did not do anything, he is still insider\ntrading. He used inside information which was only\naccessible to a certain number of people, in a\ncertain position, to not buy shares\u201d.\nOthers felt that attempting to define insider\ntrading was a worthless exercise. As a legal\nrequirement for debate in court, definitions may be\nnecessary \u2013 but the circumstances of a court case\nwould be impossible to replicate in everyday\nworking life. As views varied according to source\nand type of information and circumstances\nsurrounding such trades, a contextualist\nBusiness Strategy Review Spring 2006\u00a9 2006 The Author   |   Journal compilation \u00a9 2006 London Business School 33\n\u0002\nTr\nen\nds\nout\nIs insider trading the high crime \nthat we have been led to believe? \nAndrew P. Kakabadse, Nada K. \nKakabadse and Antje Kaspurz \ninterviewed more than four dozen \nmembers of three international \nexchanges. What their survey \nrevealed, and what they concluded, \nmay come as a surprise.\ninterpretation of inside trading became our\nfocus. In short, we tried to discover what insider\ntrading means and why it occurs.\nThe information business \nOur second finding was that insider trading is\nendemic to trading itself. According to key studies,\ninsider information refers to information that is\nmaterial but not public. However, the study\nrespondents disputed such a distinction as they\ndrew a difference between inside information and\nthe grapevine, both of which could be an equally\npowerful stimulus for trade (or not). Although \nall of the study participants recognised it as illegal\nto trade on insider information, most held the \nview that it is impossible to draw a clear line\nbetween these two sources of information. Said one\nmember of the LSE: \u201cThe Stock Exchange lives \non gossip and information. It is impossible in most\nof the cases to get to the source of information,\nwhich would make it easier to classify this info.\nHence it is impossible to decide if it was gossip or\ninsider information\u201d. \nEqually, the participants questioned whether\nobtaining material that was non-public could be\nclassified as insider information. In their view, the\nonly relevant, non-public material is that of a\nmarket sensitive nature. But no clear view emerged\nconcerning what constituted market-sensitive\ninformation. A critical aspect of a professional\nmarket trader\u2019s job is research; if he or she\nuncovered information through their own research\nendeavour, no matter its source, such information\ncannot be seen in the legal sense as insider\ninformation. Consider this statement by a member\nof the VSE: \u201cIt is my job to investigate. I have to\nfind out what is going on in the market to make the\nright decisions. If I find something out because of\nmy investigation, no one else, apart from me\nknows. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s insider information \u2013\nthat is my job\u201d.\nInside motivation \nOur third finding was that those who engage in\ninsider trading have diverse motivations. Even\nthough no shared view emerged concerning the\nnature of such behaviour, the survey participants\ndiscussed the motivation for pursuing what could be\nblatantly agreed as insider trading. Three main\nmotivators for insider trading emerged: power,\nmoney, and excitement of the deal.\nPower was considered as a particularly pertinent\nmotivator for insider trading by most, if not all. An\nLSE member phrased it this way: \u201cThese people are\nin positions where they have the highest power in a\ncompany. No one is above them. So they think who\ncan ever get me? I am the boss\u201d.\nThe majority of respondents considered money as\nan equally powerful motivator for insider trading.\nFor example, an LSE interviewee said, \u201cI would say\na motivator for an insider\u2019s trade is the most natural\nhuman quality, avarice. Especially people who work\nin this business, it is all about money, otherwise we\nwould not do it\u201d.\nAlthough power and money were identified by the\nmajority of participants as motivators for insider\ntrading, for certain of the participants the\nexcitement of the deal emerged as an additional\nmotivator. An LSE interviewee shared with us that\n\u201c ... insider information in the sense that I define it,\nmay be rather exciting. People with insider\nknowledge, being human beings, quite often want to\nboast about how they have access to insider\nknowledge secrets\u201d.\nMarket forces \nOur final finding is that the true impact of insider\ntrading on market efficiency is great, small, or nil\ndepending on whom you ask. The minority of\ninterviewees believed that insider trading has a\npositive impact on market efficiency. Their view\nemphasised that insider trading maintains the \nreal value of the market. One interviewee went\nfurther by stating that information asymmetry \nexists in markets with or without insider trading; \nhe therefore questioned why insider trading is\nviewed as harmful. A VSE respondent typified\nresponses in this regard: \u201cI truly believe that\ninsider trading has a positive impact on market\nefficiency simply because of the fact that\ninformation is quicker processed in market price.\nFurthermore I think that you always have people\nwho know more than others.\u201d\nHowever, the majority of study participants\nconsidered that insider trading has a negative effect\non market efficiency. While most agreed that market\nprice is more realistically determined if insiders\ntrade, the importance of trust in capital markets and\nits effect on efficiency were also emphasised. The\npoint being made is that insider trading undermines\ninvestor trust that, in turn, harms market efficiency.\nSays a VSE member: \u201cI think market efficiency\nsuffers if insider trading is going on because trust of\nshareholders disappears. Let\u2019s take VSE as an\n\u00a9 2006 The Author   |   Journal compilation \u00a9 2006 London Business SchoolBusiness Strategy Review Spring 200634\n\u0002\nTr\nen\nds\nInsider trading is an insignificant consideration when\ncomparing the volume of shares traded and the level of\ninsider knowledge utilised.\nexample. It was always called the \u2018Insider Stock\nExchange\u2019 and if you look at the performance of VSE\nat this time you can see that insider trading has a\nvery negative impact on market efficiency\u201d.\nShould you care?\nIt would be easy to look at our research results, as\nwell as the past literature on insider trading, and\nstate, simply, that the practice and punishment of\ntrading on inside information is relative to time,\nplace, and the people involved. To be sure, the\ncontrast of views offered by our study participants\nparallels the literature concerning the insider\ntrading effect on market efficiency, market\nconfidence and insider trading regulation.\nHowever, in contrast to the literature, the study\nparticipants raise doubt as to the meaning and\ndefinition of insider trading. Distinguishing insider\ntrading from insider information, the study\nparticipants emphasise that gaining information\nthrough research and through their personal\nnetworks is a key aspect of their job. A clear\ndistinction between research-gathered information\nand insider information does not emerge. The lack\nof equitable definition has led most of the study\nparticipants to conclude that the concept of insider\ntrading exists for political reasons and does little to\nremove privileged insiders from trading in markets.\nThe study participants consider that by creating an\natmosphere of political correctness, western\ngovernments simply look good.\nIt\u2019s time to ask a fundamental question: Despite\nall the attention given, is insider trading really such\na big deal?\nConsidering the volume and value of shares\ntraded per day, the study participants and other\ncommentators concur that the contribution of\ninsider trading to market distortions is small. One\ninsider or small groups of insiders are not\nconsidered as driving up share price to the point \nof generating dissonance in the market. Thus,\nmarket performance is viewed as being only\nmarginally impacted.\nGiven the market abuse tactics adopted by large\norganisations to drive share price artificially in a\ncertain direction, insider trading, by comparison, has\nlittle effect on the volumes traded. That some\ntraders know more than others, and that this\ninformation affects their decision making and the\ntrading behaviour of others should they become privy\nto this information, is concluded as factually true. \nHowever, the significance of that statement is\nchallenged, as markets are competitive by nature\nand, in order to be successful in a competitive\nmarket, one needs to be better informed than other\nparties. In order to minimise the mistrust and\nsuspicion involved in being better informed, we\noffer the view that appropriate reward, while\nsimultaneously making that information transparent,\nbenefits all. Rather than looking to regulate or limit\nthe individual who has access to privileged\ninformation, we conclude that attention should now\nfocus on making more information available rather\nthan increasing prosecutions. At the end of the day,\nwhich is the bigger problem: the insider trader \u2013 or\nthe large, transnational corporations who have the\ncapacity to sway markets that, in turn, potentially\nharm market efficiency in major ways? \u0003\nBusiness Strategy Review Spring 2006\u00a9 2006 The Author   |   Journal compilation \u00a9 2006 London Business School 35\nTr\nen\nds\nAndrew P.
