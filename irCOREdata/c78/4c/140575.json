Greenough et al. (2001) have\nshown how a hypermedia maintenance information system can be used to reduce\ntroubleshooting time on an automated assembly machine, whilst Crowder et al. (2000)\nand Setchi and White (2003) have investigated the technical issues related to the\npreparation and use of hypermedia documentation to support machine maintenance.\nDespite this and similar research, today\u2019s machine tool manufacturers make little use of\nthe unique features of electronic formats, such as interactivity, multimedia or\nintegration with dynamic content (for example, spares prices, stock levels and machine\nstatus). While the machine tool industry takes a conservative approach to electronic\nTSD, the aerospace industry has been using such technologies for integrated logistic\nsupport for over 20 years. Litman (1996) has identified significant benefits from the\nuse of electronic documentation to support complex weapons systems, such as\nreductions in mean time to repair of 50%, increases in the accuracy (quality) of repair\nof 40% and reductions in training time of 30%. For a flexible manufacturing system\nwith typical downtime of 40% (Somers and Gupta, 1991) such improvements could\nraise productivity significantly. It was the recognition of the opportunity for technology\ntransfer that led to the scoping study that is described in this paper.\nThe aim of the study was to investigate the extent to which techniques used to create\nTSD in the aerospace industry might be applied to the manufacturing machinery sector\nduring the next five years. The study was part-funded by the DTI under its ICT Carrier\nprogramme, with the balance of the funding from the study team comprising Cranfield\nUniversity, the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Research Institute (AMTRI), the\nManufacturing Technologies Association (MTA), GKN Aerospace Engineering\nServices, Domino Printing Sciences and Electroimpact UK. This paper presents some\nof the background to the scoping study drawn from literature and the experience of the\nstudy team, followed by a description of the study\nmethodology and presentation of results. The study comprised interviews with\nstakeholders, a questionnaire survey and a workshop.\nTrends in manufacturing\nThe current interest in lean manufacturing has placed greater emphasis on the\navailability of production machinery and therefore the service provided by those who\nmaintain the machinery. The technical complexity of today\u2019s machine tools means that\nthey must be supported by comprehensive, accurate and highly usable documentation.\nAccording to AMTRI (2000), four trends will change the nature of TSD for machine\ntools.\n1. The trend for machinery manufacturers to become service providers, retaining\nownership of the machinery and assuming responsibility for its availability and\nsupport.\n2. The trend towards modularity in the design of machinery. This \u2018mass\ncustomisation\u2019 approach allows manufacturers to respond to market requirements\nrapidly and cost effectively.\n3. The continuing skills shortages throughout manufacturing, that may lead to greater\nemphasis on effective documentation of equipment and procedures as well as better\nquality training of new recruits.\n4. The trend towards Internet-based remote support of machinery.\nThese trends raise several related questions. If machinery manufacturers become\nservice providers and therefore users of their own TSD, how will this change the\napproach that they take to the authoring of such documents? How do the related\nconcepts of modularity and mass customisation apply to product documentation? What\nis the appropriate mix of classroom training and on-the-job technical support and what\nis the best way to impart technical knowledge to maintenance workers? To what extent\nwill tomorrow\u2019s machine tools be supported remotely and what role will web\ntechnologies such as those described by Wang et al. (2004), play in machine fault\ndiagnosis?\nIn addition to these trends, the globalisation of manufacturing places a premium on\nthe accurate translation of complex technical documents and on the use, where\npossible, of language-independent methods of communication, such as multimedia.\nServicisation\nThe tendency of some manufacturers to re-position themselves as service providers has\nbeen called \u2018servicisation\u2019 (Howells, 2003). Perhaps the best-known example of\nservicisation is the transition of both General Electric and Rolls-Royce from selling\naircraft engines to selling a \u2018power by the hour\u2019 service that includes leasing,\nmaintenance, repair, inventory management and facilities support (DTI, 2000). Wise\nand Baumgartner (1999) suggest nine metrics that indicate whether a transition towards\nselling a service rather than a product would be profitable, including the ratio of installed\nbase to new product sales. By this metric it makes sense for a locomotive manufacturer\nto position itself as a service provider, but not a manufacturer of video cassette\nrecorders. It is not yet clear to what extent machine tool manufacturers perceive\nthemselves as service providers, but if they do decide to follow the servicisation trend,\nthe decision will surely affect the way in which they manage the creation and use of\nTSD.\nTechnical documentation for machine tools\nOne of the first objectives of the scoping study was to canvass the views of today\u2019s\nmachine tool designers. When asked his view on the relevance of electronic TSD to\nmachine tools, a designer commented that at present there is no coherent electronic\nlibrary of information to assist designers. Such a library could be very useful, in his\nview, if it contained:\n\uf0b7 Basic machinery design data\n\uf0b7 Relevant ISO standards\n\uf0b7 Online technical support of the standard machine components\n\uf0b7 Health and safety information\n\uf0b7 Details of relevant research.\nMTA members confirmed that most current TSD for machine tools is provided as\nhardcopy. One reason for this is that at their customers\u2019 premises the equipment for\nreading electronic information is usually remote from the point of machine use or\neven \u2018off-limits\u2019 to factory workers. Electronic TSD is usually available only for\nmachines in which the controller is a PC that also provides the human-machine\ninterface. The main problems associated with paper documentation are issue control,\ncomprehension, translation and speed of access. It was felt that any electronic solution\nto these problems must be cost-effective and take no longer to create documents than\ncurrent methods.\nTechnical documentation in the aerospace sector\nThe emergence of electronic TSD in the aerospace industry was driven by the need to\nsupport highly complex products over an extended life cycle, the duration of which is\nunknown at the time of design. The industry achieved this through the development of\ndocumentation standards that provide consistent structure and content element\ncodification which are essential for the efficient compilation, identification,\nmanagement and integration of data in a computerised environment.\nA key standard in the history of technical documents for civil aircraft was the Air\nTransport Association (ATA) 100 specification, which mandated the layout of\ninformation in a precise and consistent sequence including chapterisation by system,\nsub-system and component, the use of page blocks for types of information and a\nconsistent arrangement and sequence of chapter contents. Table 1 shows the ATA 100\nstandard chapter headings and Table 2 that ATA 100 standard page blocks by subject.\nWithin this system, for example, section 49-10-10 refers to the fuel control unit\n(component level) which is part of the power generation sub-system which in turn is\npart of the auxiliary power system. In this case since the component is itself an\nassembly, the system is used to further index the sub-assemblies and the parts within\neach of these.\n<Place table 1 here>\n<Place table 2 here>\nA range of document standards was developed to describe the codification of tasks\nand sub-tasks below page block level. These standards have now been incorporated\ninto the ATA specification. The ATA system has allowed the civil aviation industry\nto achieve a high degree of data linkage without the cost penalty of a formal\nintegrated logistic support system.\nThe style and format of technical documentation for defence systems, including\naircraft, was a haphazard affair until the late 1980s. The US Department of Defense\nlaunched the CALS (Computer-aided Acquisition & Logistic Support) initiative in the\nmid-1980s to address some of the anomalies and inconsistencies of TSD. ATA 100\nand its derivatives have now been adopted as the de facto documentation standard\nwithin CALS for all new military aircraft programs. European military authorities\ndeveloped their own version of CALS and a commonly-applied specification for\ntechnical manuals, AECMA S1000D, has gradually replaced all earlier national\nvariants. For air vehicles, the data module code system of AECMA S1000D is based\non the ATA codification system. There is now therefore, a degree of uniformity\nbetween TSD for civil and military aircraft.\nApplication of aerospace practice to machine tools\nThe ATA 100 system is clearly comprehensive enough in principle to cover all the\ninformation types needed for machine tool documentation. One could imagine a\nstandard chapterisation scheme for machine tools that covered such systems as the\nspindle drive, axis drives, control systems, frame, coolant system, lubrication system\nand all their associated sub-systems and components. As well as support\ndocumentation, machinery manufacturers are currently obliged to provide a structured\ntechnical file in order to comply with the machinery directive and to obtain a CE mark.\nA content management system could be specified to meet existing requirements as well\nas the proposed standard chapters and page blocks. At least one large user of machine\ntools, the Ford Motor Company, has introduced its own standardised section headings\nfor production machinery and has required machinery suppliers to comply with this\nsystem. However, if machinery users act independently in this way, they will inevitably\ndesign different chapterisation schemes, even if they are similar in principle. It may be\npossible for a machinery supplier to map their chosen structure onto that favoured by a\nuser and so re-purpose technical support documentation to suit a range of customers,\nhowever it would surely be more cost-effective for the machine tool industry to act\ntogether to standardise the structure and layout of their technical documentation, as the\naerospace industry has.\nIn addition to the structure and meaning of technical documentation, the CALS and\nAECMA S1000D standards deal with the storage and exchange of digital information. It\nis likely that despite the benefits of standardisation on data formats such as SGML for\nstructured text and CGM for vector graphics, the complexity of such standards and the\ncost of compliant authoring tools would make this approach impractical for\nmachine tool builders at present. However, if the cost of authoring tools for structured\ndocumentation reduces, this may well prove to be a suitable approach for the machine\ntool industry. An example of such a tool might be a content management system for\ncreation and maintenance of a web site and other documents that re-use the same\ncontent.\nInterviews with stakeholders\nThe project sought the opinions of a range of stakeholders who could help to form a\nview of the current use of electronic TSD in the aerospace industry and the scope for\ntransfer. The project team identified four interviewees from each of the following\ntypes of organisation:\n1. Suppliers of authoring tools for electronic TSD\n2. Users of authoring tools for electronic TSD (from various industries)\n3. Aerospace users of electronic TSD\n4. Manufacturing machinery suppliers\n5. Machinery users and maintainers.\nThe interviews confirmed that technical authors in the aerospace industry take a\nfundamentally standards-based approach. This has resulted in the dominance of two\nsoftware tools; Adobe Framemaker and Arbortext Epic, with many associated tools\nfrom third parties. By comparison, technical authors within the manufacturing\nmachinery sector use cheaper, less powerful tools that are more generic and less\nfocused on the creation of structured documentation, the re-use of content or adherence\nto information standards. Whether the manufacturing machinery sector will adopt\ndocumentation practices from today\u2019s aerospace authors may depend largely on the\ndevelopment and acceptance of information standards. There are signs that this is\nhappening in the pharmaceutical, food and electronics industries, so machinery builders\nwho serve these industries may, in future, be seen as \u2018early adopters\u2019. Authoring tool\nvendors and technical authors identified general trends towards online information,\nwith the content management features of these tools being used to allow easy updates\nand re-use of content. Of particular relevance to the machinery sector is a trend towards\nthe delivery of online information through the human-machine interface at the\ncontroller. Users of electronic TSD within the aerospace industry\nindicated that there is scope for improvement of the documents, citing poor usability,\nthe cost of display hardware and its poor portability as particular problems. PDF is the\nmost commonly used presentation format for technical support documents, although\nthe preference of the defence sector of the aerospace industry is for fully-functional\nInteractive Electronic Technical Manuals, as described by Setchi and White (2003).\nAuthors of technical support documentation for manufacturing machinery agreed that\nfrom their customers\u2019 perspective, ease of use is most important, but stated that ease of\ninformation access and information accuracy are also very important. The four\nmachinery users confirmed these views.\nTechnical authors for manufacturing machinery also felt that the most important\nbenefits of enhanced document creation methods would be reduced costs and enhanced\ncustomer satisfaction. Only one of the four authors interviewed was using software\ndesigned specifically for the creation of structured documentation, the others choosing\ngeneric products such as Microsoft Office and various computer-aided design (CAD)\ntools. As with their counterparts in the aerospace sector, technical authors from the\nmanufacturing machinery sector also use PDF for presentation of the majority of their\nelectronic technical documents.\nQuestionnaire survey\nThe survey of members of the MTA comprised thirteen questions. These explored\nexisting approaches to TSD for manufacturing machinery, and likely developments\nover the next five years. Of the 47 questionnaires sent to members, only seven were\nreturned. This response rate of only 15% may reflect the current priorities of a\ntroubled industry.\nNotwithstanding the poor response to the questionnaire, the survey confirmed some\nearlier findings of the scoping study, such as the importance of a low cost approach to\ndocumentation and the widespread use of CAD and generic office tools to author\ntechnical documents (Figure 1).\n<Place figure 1 here>\nAn indication of the relatively small technical documentation activity in the machine\ntool companies surveyed is the small number of dedicated technical authors\nemployed. Four of the survey respondents do not employ anybody dedicated to\ntechnical authoring and only one respondent employs two or more such staff (see\nFigure 2).\n<Place figure 2 here>\nDespite this, there are signs that some machine tool manufacturers expect to provide\nmore interactivity (a feature only possible with electronic documents) for their\ncustomers in future. This is despite their view that there is little customer demand for this\nand their feeling that that technical support documentation is not a source of strong\ncompetitive advantage.\nThere was broad agreement that the most important feature of electronic TSD to\ncustomers would be the provision of step-by-step multimedia guidance for routine\nmaintenance and set-up operations. Machinery builders attach significant importance to\nthree features of electronic technical documentation; greater control of document\nrevision level, re-use of information and reduced time to market.\nBased on the questionnaire responses, one can conclude that there may be a small\ntrend towards electronic TSD for machine tools, especially online technical assistance.\nHowever, machine tool companies are very unlikely to invest significant resources in\nthe development of electronic technical documentation beyond that required to keep\nup with the competition and the modest expectations of their customers.\nWorkshop\nThe aim of the one-day workshop was to stimulate and capture discussion among\nexperts from the manufacturing machinery and machine tool industries, with respect to\nelectronic technical documentation. Twenty-four delegates attended the workshop.\nFollowing presentations on the results of the project so far, delegates were split into\nthree groups. Each group was each asked to consider the following three questions:\n1. What are the drivers and constraints relating to the adoption of e-support\ntechnologies?\n2. What are the types and relative priorities of information relevant to e-support?\n3. What steps should the machinery sector take to harness e-support technology to\ncurrent business objectives?\nDrivers and constraints\nWorkshop delegates gave mixed responses to this question. On one hand, the need to\nreduce cost was emphasised here and throughout the workshop, to the extent that the\nimpression given was of an industry struggling for survival. On the other hand, a\nsignificant majority of factors driving the adoption of e-support technologies were\nrelated to the need to increase quality. It is therefore felt that the industry will adopt e -\nsupport technologies when and if managers see them delivering a better service to the\ncustomer, without incurring a cost penalty. The main factor constraining the adoption\nof e-support technologies is the absence of suitable standards for hardware, software\nand information. Other constraints were felt to be the cost of adoption and lack of\nmanagement commitment.\nTypes of information for e-support\nIt was agreed that the three most important types of information that should be\nprovided using e-support technologies are, in order of priority:\n1. Operating and safety information\n2. Maintenance procedures\n3. Fault diagnostics.\nDelegates identified other categories of suitable information such as service\ninformation, spare part details (including prices) and design information, but there\nwas little agreement on relative priorities.\nNext steps that the sector should take\nDelegates agreed that the first step that needs to be taken by the industry to harness e -\nsupport technologies is to form a working party to identify standards for information\ncontent and format and the software tools that will be needed to create and manage\nelectronic TSD. It was suggested that a questionnaire should be used to form a detailed\npicture of customer requirements. The second step is to investigate a mechanism by\nwhich organisations within the manufacturing machinery industry can collaborate to\ncreate and manage electronic TSD to mutual advantage, without compromising the\ncompetitive position of any organisation. The third step is to prepare an implementation\nplan and disseminate this throughout the industry, perhaps\nusing a technology demonstrator to validate the plan and educate the producers of\nmanufacturing machinery and their customers about the best use of e-support\ntechnologies.\nConclusions\nIf machine tool manufacturers re-position themselves as service providers, they will\nbenefit from the adoption of some of the information technologies in use today in the\naerospace sector. This project has shown that the machine tool industry currently\nperceives low customer demand for electronic support documentation. If this is true,\none explanation might be that whereas the pursuit of lower life-cycle costs has driven\nthe adoption of electronic TSD in the aerospace industry, what matters much more to\nmachine tool users are functionality and low purchase price. However this need not be a\nconstraint to the adoption of electronic TSD by the machine tool industry as long as\nmachinery manufacturers see electronic TSD as a means of lowering the cost of\nregulatory compliance as well as minimising life-cycle costs for their customers. If and\nwhen lower cost of ownership of machine tools does become a selling point, then it will\nbe rational for manufacturers to collaborate in the development of information\nstandards within the industry and to integrate electronic TSD into their products. At\npresent, many technical authors in machine tool manufacturing are using inappropriate\nauthoring tools, and this research suggests that the adoption of more suitable tools and\ntechniques would allow them to reduce the cost of creating and maintaining electronic\nTSD. The core content of such documents is likely to comprise operating and safety\ninformation, maintenance procedures and fault diagnostics. Perhaps the most likely\nfuture technology transfer scenario is the gradual adoption of some of the\ndocumentation practices from the aerospace sector, driven by the spread of information\nstandards created by global regulatory bodies. The industry could prepare for the future\nby supporting the development of information standards and exploring the best use of\nelectronic TSD, perhaps through a technology demonstrator.\nReferences\nAMTRI (2000), \u2018Manufacturing Machinery Foresight, Final report for the Department of Trade and Industry\u2019,\nAMTRI reference number: 3rs6049\/4, www.amtri.co.uk (2000), accessed on 15th October 2002.\nCrowder, R., Hall, W., Heath, I. and Wills, G.
