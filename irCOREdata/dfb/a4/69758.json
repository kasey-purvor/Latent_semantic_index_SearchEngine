The analysis of stability and the development of methods of\ncontrol, applicable to chaotic systems in the presence of noise, are therefore of considerable\ninterdisciplinary importance [Bishop & Xu, 1996; Zhou et al., 2003; Billings et al., 2004].\nExamples of applications range from ecology [Sole et al., 1999] to space travel [Serban\net al., 2002]. Deep insight into the solution of these problems can be gained from studies\nof the invariant manifolds that determine the pattern of optimal paths [Graham & Te\u00b4l,\n1984; Dykman et al., 1996; Luchinsky, 2002] along which a system fluctuates to a given\npoint in configuration space in the limit of large deviations, i.e. where the noise intensity is\nmuch smaller then the minimum action required to move the system from the attractor to\nthat point. Particularly important in this context is the role played by the so-called most\nprobable escape path (MPEP) [Dykman & Krivoglaz, 1979], along which the system\nescapes from a given basin of attraction. The central idea is finding a wide range of\nscientific applications including biological ratchets [Luchinsky et al., 2000], dynamical\ninference of e.g. the cardiovascular system [Smelyanskiy et al., 2005], control of e.g. lasers\n[Khovanov et al., 2006], and protein folding [Faccioli et al., 2006]. We shall see that\nthe picture applies to chaotic attractors as well as to regular ones, even where the basin\nstructure is fractal.\nThe conceptual framework is applicable to both flows and maps. It can be developed\nby following e.g. Grassberger [1989] (see also [Kifer, 1990; Graham et al., 1991]). Consider\nthe L\u2013dimensional map\nxn+1 = f(xn) + \u03c3zn, \u3008z\u03b1nz\u03b2n\u2032\u3009 = \u03b4nn\u2032\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2, (1)\nwhere xn, \u03b7n \u2208 RL, and \u03c3 is a row matrix mixing zero-mean white Gaussian sources of\nnoise zn. Comparison of (1) with a midpoint approximation for the time evolution of an\nL-dimensional flow on the discrete time n = 1, ..., N\nxn+1 = xn + hF (x\n\u2217\nn) + \u03c3z\u02dcn, z\u02dcn =\n\u222b tn+h\ntn\n\u03be(t)dt, \u3008z\u02dcnz\u02dcn\u2032\u3009 = hI\u02c6\u03b4nn\u2032 (2)\nshows that (2) is a special case of the map (1) with a small parameter h, and x\u2217n =\nxn+xn+1\n2\n.\nThus the main results obtained below for maps can also be applied to flows, using the\nfollowing rule: (i) make the substitutions f(xn) \u2192 xn + hF (x\u2217n) and \u03c3 \u2192\n\u221a\nh\u03c3\u02dc; and\n(ii) take the limit h \u2192 0. In the particular case of large deviations, we are interested\nin the minimum of the energy functional under the condition xn+1 \u2212 f(xn) \u2212 \u03c3zn =\n0. It is intuitively clear that S is a non-decreasing function along the trajectory and\nmust be at least piece-wise differentiable in the limit h \u2192 0, thus justifying its use as a\ngeneralized potential for non-equilibrium systems [Graham & Te\u00b4l, 1984; Jauslin, 1987].\nBy introducing Lagrange multipliers \u03bbn and varying the effective functional\nS\u2217 =\n1\n2\nN\u2211\nn=1\n\u03beTn \u03ben +\nN\u2211\nn=1\n\u03bbTn (xn+1 \u2212 f(xn)\u2212 \u03c3\u03ben) (3)\nwith respect to \u03ben, \u03bbn, and xn (cf. [Grassberger, 1989; Beri et al., 2005]) one obtains the\nequations of motion of the system along optimal paths in the course of large deviations\n1 INTRODUCTION 3\nin the form of an area-preserving map\nxn+1 = f(xn) + \u03c3\u03c3\nT\u03bbn, \u03bbn+1 = [f\n\u2032(xn+1)]\n\u22121T\n\u03bbn. (4)\nTranslating this result for a flow system [Beri et al., 2005] we obtain\nx\u02d9 = F (x) +D\u2032p, p\u02d9 = \u2212F \u2032(x)p, (5)\nwhere D = \u03c3\u02dc\u03c3\u02dcT , and in the h \u2192 0 limit we have introduced the notations \u03bbn \u2192 p(t),\nxn \u2192 x(t), (\u03bbn+1 \u2212 \u03bbn)\/h \u2192 p\u02d9, and (xn+1 \u2212 xn)\/h \u2192 x\u02d9. Note that the Hamiltonian\nequations thus obtained (with Hamiltonian H = 1\n2\npTDp+ pTF ) for the optimal paths are\nknown from a WKB-like approximation of the Fokker-Planck equation [Cohen & Lewis,\n1967; Ventcel & Freidlin, 1970].\nThe application of (4) and (5) to analysis of the stability and control of chaotic flows\nand maps requires knowledge of the boundary conditions. In particular, the stability of an\nattractor is determined by the probability of escape from its basin of attraction along the\nMPEP. Similarly, restriction of the system dynamics within the basin of a given attractor\nis enforced by a control function that steers the system to its boundary. In the particular\ncase of energy optimal control, the problems of stability and control can both be reduced\nto boundary value problems for auxiliary Hamiltonian flows (5) [Luchinsky et al., 1998] or\narea preserving maps (4) [Khovanov et al., 2000]. It is clear therefore that analysis of the\nboundary conditions is crucial for the solution of both problems. Formally, the boundary\nconditions are set at the attractor (for t\u2192 \u2212\u221e) and at the boundary (for t\u2192 +\u221e). At\nthe end points both \u03bb and p are zero.\nIn the case of chaotic dynamics, however, the geometrical structure of the attractor\n(and also the boundary in cases where this is fractal) is very complex. And it is not known\na priori if the boundary conditions in chaotic systems can be specified uniquely or, indeed,\nwhether a unique MPEP exists at all. Consequently, the fluctuational escape problem\nin chaotic systems has attracted a great deal of attention during the last two decades\n(see e.g. [Beale, 1989; Grassberger, 1989; Kifer, 1990; Graham et al., 1991; Reimann\net al., 1994; Reimann & Talkner, 1995; Kraut & Feudel, 2003]). Here we present a brief\nreview of recent progress in understanding the boundary conditions for escape from a\nCA, both with and without fractal boundaries [Luchinsky & Khovanov, 1999; Khovanov\net al., 2000; Luchinsky, 2002; Silchenko et al., 2003a; Khovanov et al., 2003; Kraut &\nGrebogi, 2004; Beri et al., 2005; Silchenko et al., 2005] It turns out that the boundary\nconditions at the attractor and on its fractal boundary can be identified uniquely with\ncertain unstable periodic orbits. This in turn opens up the possibility of developing a\ngeneral approach to the solution of the stability and control problems by application of\na WKB-like approximation. To identify boundary conditions on the attractor a method\nbased on the prehistory probability distribution Dykman et al. [1992] can conveniently\nbe employed [Dykman et al., 1996; Luchinsky et al., 1997; Luchinsky, 2002; Silchenko\net al., 2005]. The exact locations of the unstable periodic orbits can be found by use of\nthe standard methods of nonlinear dynamics [Schmelcher & Diakonos, 1997]. It has also\nbeen found recently that in some quite general situations the boundary conditions can\nbe identified directly from the known structure of non-hyperbolic attractors and fractal\nboundaries [Silchenko et al., 2003a; Kraut & Grebogi, 2004].\nOnce the boundary conditions are identified, the MPEP can be found as the path that\nboth minimizes the energy functional (3) and also belongs to the unstable manifold of\n2 CHAOTIC ESCAPE OVER A REGULAR BASIN BOUNDARY 4\nthe boundary orbit embedded within the attractor MUA and the stable manifold MSB of\nthe boundary orbit on the attractor boundary. Analyses of the structure ofMUA andMSB\ncan to some extent be carried out in parallel [Maier & Stein, 1997]. As an example [Beri\net al., 2005], consider the parameterizations ofMUA in the close vicinity of the stable point\nS of period one, where the map (4) can be linearized as\n[\n\u03b4n+1\n\u03bbn+1\n]\n= M\n[\n\u03b4n\n\u03bbn\n]\n, M =\n[\nf \u2032(S) I\n0 [f \u2032(S)]\u22121T\n]\n(6)\nwhere \u03b4n is a small deviation from S and the corresponding \u201cmomentum\u201d \u03bbn \u223c O(\u03b4n).\nBecause of its area-preserving property (note the structure of M in Eq. (6)), M has the\nsame number L for contracting \u03b1s and expanding \u03b1u eigenvalues. Clearly,MUA is spanned\nby the eigenvectors corresponding to the expanding eigenvalues. Then an arbitrary point\non MUA can be written as\n[\n\u03b4n+1\n\u03bbn+1\n]\n=\nL\u2211\nl=1\ncl\u03b1\nn\nu,l\n[\ne\u03b4u,l\ne\u03bbu,l\n]\n, (7)\nwhere e\u03b4u,l and e\n\u03bb\nu,l are the L-dimensional coordinate and \u201cmomentum\u201d components of\nthe 2L-dimensional eigenvector corresponding to the expanding eigenvalue \u03b1u,l. It can\nbe seen from (7) that MUA of the 2L-dimensional map (4) can be parameterized with L\nparameters cl. For a small deviation \u03b4 chosen in an L-dimensional spherical shell around\nS, the corresponding effective momenta can be found as\n\u03bbn =\n[\ne\u03bbu,l\n] [\ne\u03b4u,l\n]\n\u22121\n\u03b4n, (8)\nwhere\n[\ne\u03bbu,l\n]\nand\n[\ne\u03b4u,l\n]\n\u22121\nare L \u00d7 L matrices composed of L-dimensional column vectors\ne\u03bbu,l and e\n\u03b4\nu,l.\nSimilar results can be obtained for the flow (2). One must bear in mind that, in the\ncontinuous case,MUA can be characterized by (L\u2212 1) parameters because, for the system\n(5), one of the eigenvalues corresponding to motion along the limit cycle is necessarily\n0. In practice, to parameterize MUA in the continuous, case one has: (i) to identify the\nboundary limit cycle; and (ii) to introduce a Poincare\u00b4 cross-section for this limit cycle\nand a corresponding map. The parameterizations of MUA in the Poincare\u00b4 cross-section\ncan then be performed following Eqs. (6)-(8).\nBelow we focus exclusively on analysis of the boundary conditions. The closely related\nproblem of the analysis of invariant measures on chaotic attractors is not considered here\n(see, however, [Jung & Ha\u00a8nggi, 1990; Reimann et al., 1994; Reimann & Talkner, 1995;\nBeri et al., 2005]).\nWe will describe and discuss recent progress in the analysis of the escape problem in\nchaotic systems, treating escape over regular and fractal basin boundaries in Secs. 2 and\n3 respectively. We summarise the status of the subject and identify the main problems\nstill to be solved in Sec. 4.\n2 Chaotic escape over a regular basin boundary\nWe now consider and compare noise-induced escape from the basins of quasi-hyperbolic\nand non-hyperbolic CAs. The property of hyperbolicity means that, at each point of\n2 CHAOTIC ESCAPE OVER A REGULAR BASIN BOUNDARY 5\na chaotic set, the tangent space can be split into expanding and contracting subspaces\n(manifolds), and that the angle between the subspaces differs from zero. In case of a\nquasi-hyperbolic attractor, the property hyperbolicity is broken into a finite number of\npoints. In a non-hyperbolic attractor, homoclinic tangencies between stable and unstable\nmanifolds take place at an infinite numbers of points. The homoclinic tangencies form\na homoclinic structure which is structurally unstable [Smale, 1966] and can be changed\ncompletely by a small variation of parameters [Gonchenko et al., 1997]. CAs are typically\nnon-hyperbolic.\nWe suppose the basins of attraction to be smooth and that one can distinguish a\nboundary set. Within the framework of large fluctuation theory [Freidlin & Wentzel,\n1984] we expect escape via the boundary set in the zero-noise limit. Another boundary\nhas to be chosen on the CA. In the case of a quasi-hyperbolic attractor we have a density\nof saddle cycles; the trajectory is bounded by manifolds of the cycles and there is a very\nsmall (in comparison with the whole attractor) region that is non-hyperbolic. For a non-\nhyperbolic attractor we cannot specify the sets composing the attractor. Moreover it\nhas been shown [Afraimovich et al., 1983] that a typical non-hyperbolic attractor can be\nconsidered as a quasi-attractor composed of several sets including hyperbolic and stable\nones; complex behaviour is induced by round-off errors in computer simulations or by\nnoise in experiments. In the neither case can we specify a priori any particular set as the\nboundary condition. In the case of a fractal boundary (see Sec. 3) there is an immediate\nquestion: which boundary set is the boundary for the optimal escape path? In addition,\nnoise can significantly change the probability distribution on the attractor [Anishchenko\net al., 2001; Schroer et al., 1998]. It is obvious that in such a situation a direct solution\nof the equation (5) is problematic. We have therefore used an experimental approach to\nsolve the boundary problem.\nThe approach proposed by Dykman et al. [1992] is based on the fact that the optimal\npath is not a theoretical abstraction: on the contrary, the path corresponds to a real\ntrajectory that can be observed in an experiment. The approach consists in making\nmeasurements of the prehistory probability distribution ph(x, t;xf , tf ) in which information\nis gathered on all trajectories in a close neighborhood of the chosen state xf outside the\nattractor. Luchinsky [1997] has demonstrated that the approach allows one to determine\nthe optimal fluctuational force as well. For our task the prehistory approach allows us to\navoid the question of boundary conditions mentioned above, and of the distribution near\nthe CA, and simultaneously determines the boundary condition on the CA.\nAs an example of a multistable system with a non-hyperbolic attractor, we chose a\nnon-autonomous nonlinear oscillator and, as a system with a quasi-hyperbolic attractor,\nwe selected the Lorenz equations with white noise included additively in one variable.\nWe first consider escape from the quasi-hyperbolic attractor in the Lorenz system.\nThe latter was originally obtained as a simplified model to describe convection of a fluid\nbetween two planes at different temperatures, where the thermal and gravitational gra-\ndients are oppositely directed [Lorenz, 1963]. Later it was considered as a model for the\nsingle mode laser [Haken, 1975; Weiss et al., 1988, 1995]. It is described by the following\nequations:\nx\u02d91 = \u03c3(x2 \u2212 x1), x\u02d92 = rx1 \u2212 x2 \u2212 x1x3, x\u02d93 = x1x2 \u2212 bx3 +\n\u221a\nD\u03be(t), (9)\nHere, x1, x2 and x3 are the dynamical variables; and \u03c3, r and b are parameters. For\nsimplicity we add a white-noise source \u03be(t) of intensity D only to the third equation\n2 CHAOTIC ESCAPE OVER A REGULAR BASIN BOUNDARY 6\n\u221220\n\u221210 0 10 20\n\u221220 \u221210 0 10 20\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n \u03931\n x2\n C\n S\n P1\n A\n O\n S\n C\n P2\n x1\n \u03932\n x3\n (a)\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n t\n \u2329 x3\ne\n \u232a\n 1\n 2\n 3\n S\n A\n C\n \u2329 \u03bee \u232a  (b)\nFigure 1: (a) The structure of phase space of the Lorenz system.

The three stages of escape are indicated.\nof system (9); this does not violate the mirror symmetry of the system. We set the\nparameters as \u03c3 = 10, b = 8\/3, r = 24.08, so that two stable equilibrium points P1\nand P2 coexist with a CA as shown in Fig. 1(a). The saddle cycles, with stable manifolds\ntransverse to the attractor, are dense everywhere in the Lorenz CA. Apart from the saddle\ncycles, the chaotic set also contains the separatrices \u03931 and \u03932 and the saddle point O.\nThe existence of a saddle point in the CA defines the non-hyperbolicity property and the\nprefix \u201cquasi\u201d in the definition of a quasi-hyperbolic CA [Afraimovich et al., 1983].\nThe boundaries of the CA are specified by the initial segments of the separatrices\n\u03931 and \u03932 that closely approach the saddle cycles L1 and L2 (see Fig. 1(a)), and which\ntheoretically [Afraimovich et al., 1983] belong to the attractor. However, numerical studies\nhave shown that the probability of the noise-free system passing near the separatrices\n\u03931 and \u03932 or the cycles L1 and L2 is exponentially small. In fact, in the noise-free\nsystem, no trajectories could be found approaching a close vicinity of these cycles along\nthe separatrices on any reasonable timescale of observation (a few weeks in our case).\nVery weak noise (D = 0.001) can induce transitions from the CA to the states P1 or\nP2, so that the Lorenz attractor becomes metastable. We build prehistory distributions\nboth for the escape trajectories and for the corresponding realizations of the random force.\nFor definiteness, we examine escape to the stable point P1.\nAnalysis of the prehistory distribution of the escape trajectories by Anishchenko et al.\n[2002] shows that there is well-defined maximum in their distribution. We can therefore\ndefine the optimal path by ensemble-averaging the escape trajectories. The optimal fluc-\ntuational force can be obtained by averaging the corresponding realizations of the random\nforce. Fig. 1(b) shows the coordinate x3 of the optimal path (MPEP), and the value p3\nof the averaged fluctuational force, as functions of time. The results obtained suggest the\nfollowing scenario of escape from the Lorenz attractor. The escape path consists of the\nthree main parts shown in Fig. 1(b): (i) the deterministic part from point S to point A;\n(ii) a part corresponding to fast fluctuation-assisted motion along the separatrices from\npoint A to point C; and (iii) slow diffusion from point C to overcome the deterministic\n2 CHAOTIC ESCAPE OVER A REGULAR BASIN BOUNDARY 7\n\u22122 \u22121 0 1\n\u22121\n0\n1\n x\n \n x\n.\n (a)\n   SC1\n   S1\n0 5 10 15\n\u22121\n0\n1\n2\n3\n \u03c9ft\/2pi\n \u2329 x\n \nesc\u232a\n \u2329 \u03beesc\u232a (b)\n 0\n \u22120.05\nFigure 2: (a) The structure of phase space of (10) in Poincare\u00b4 section.

It is important to\nnote that noise plays a different role during each part of the escape [Anishchenko et al.,\n2002].\nThus, for a quasi-hyperbolic attractor, there exists a unique optimal escape path. The\nrole of fluctuations is two-fold. First, they deliver the system to a seldom-visited region\nin the neighborhood of the saddle cycle L1. Secondly they induce the system to cross\nthe saddle cycle L1. The analysis does not indicate any specific sets that can be viewed\nas the boundary condition on the CA, but it clearly shows that the escape process is\nclosely connected with the non-hyperbolic structure of attractor: the stable and unstable\nmanifolds of the saddle point O.\nWe now discuss escape from a non-hyperbolic attractor in the periodically driven\nnonlinear oscillator described by:\nx\u00a8 = \u22122\u0393x\u02d9\u2212 \u03c920x\u2212 x2 \u2212 x3 + h sin(\u03c9f t) +\n\u221a\nD\u03be(t). (10)\nHere x corresponds to the oscillator coordinate; \u0393 and \u03c90 are oscillator parameters; h and\n\u03c9f are the amplitude and frequency of external driving. This form of nonlinear oscillator\nis encountered in many applications [Soskin et al., 1997]. We fixed the parameters (\u0393 =\n0.025, \u03c90 = 0.597, h = 0.13, \u03c9f = 0.95) in the region where the CA and a stable limit\ncycle SC1 coexist as shown in Fig. 2(a). The CA appears as the result of period-doubling\nbifurcations, and thus corresponds to non-hyperbolic attractor [Gonchenko et al., 1997].\nUnfortunately, in contrast to the Lorenz system, there is no clear description of the\nstructure of the non-hyperbolic attractor.\nThe boundary between the attractors is formed by stable manifolds of the saddle cycle\nof period 1 (S1). The filled circles in Fig. 2(a) show the intersections of one of the real\nescape trajectories with the given Poincare\u00b4 section. Analysis of the prehistory distribution\n[Luchinsky & Khovanov, 1999; Luchinsky, 2002] showed that most probable escape path\nstarts at the saddle cycle of period 5 (S5) embedded in the attractor, passes through\nthe saddle cycle of period 3 (S3) and finishes on the saddle cycle S1 at the boundary of\n2 CHAOTIC ESCAPE OVER A REGULAR BASIN BOUNDARY 8\nthe basin of attraction. It can be seen in Fig. 2(b) that the optimal force switches on\nat the moment when the system leaves S5 along its unstable manifold and switches off\nagain when the system reaches the boundary cycle S1. Finite action is required to move\nsystem from S5 to S3, and additional analysis showed that the cycle S3 does not belong\nto the CA, although it lies close to the attractor boundary. Additionally we found that\nfor a very small noise intensity (insufficient to observe transitions to S1 on a reasonable\ntime scale) a large fluctuation from the CA corresponds to a transition from the cycle S5\nto the cycle S3 and, moreover, trajectories reaching S3 have all passed through S5. The\nprobability of finding the system on S5 does not lie within the highest probability region of\nthe attractor, but neither is S5 in the exponential tail of the distribution in the presence of\nnoise. With increasing noise intensity, the probability of finding the system in the vicinity\nof S5 increases. It is important to note that, although S5 is in the low-probability region\nof the attractor, the transient time tr required for the system to reach S5 (in the presence\nof noise) from an arbitrary initial condition on the attractor is still exponentially smaller\nthan the average escape time te.\nThus, the experimental approach based on an analysis of the prehistory of large fluc-\ntuations allows us: (i) to conclude that escape from a non-hyperbolic attractor occurs in\na sequence of jumps between saddle cycles; (ii) to specify the boundary condition on the\nCA; and (iii) to determine the energy-minimal (optimal) fluctuational force controlling\nthe transition between attractors. Note that we confirmed the results of the prehistory\napproach by numerical solution of (5) with the boundary conditions set on the cycles S5\nand S1 [Luchinsky, 2002].\nIt is instructive to compare the escape processes from quasi-hyperbolic and non-\nhyperbolic attractors. We stress two points.\n(i) To determine the optimal path corresponding to the solution of (5) we applied the\nprehistory approach. It allows us to determine the trajectory corresponding to a\nglobal minimum of the escape energy if the relaxation time to an equilibrium distri-\nbution on the attractor, tr, is much shorter than the fluctuational escape time from\nthe attractor, tesc: tr \u226a tesc. This escape time increases exponentially with decreas-\ning noise intensity D as tesc \u221d exp(S\/D), where S is the activation \u201cenergy\u201d. Since\nD is always finite in practice (because observation times are necessarily finite), the\nsatisfaction of the condition tr \u226a tesc is primarily related to tr, i.e. to the properties\nof the equilibrium distribution on the attractor. For the non-hyperbolic CA in the\nperiodically-driven nonlinear oscillator, the noise intensity can be chosen in such a\nway that the condition tr \u226a tesc is satisfied. In this case, the optimal trajectory\nfound does not depend on the initial conditions on the attractor or on the noise\nintensity. For the Lorenz system, the situation is different. As pointed out above,\nthe probability of the system being in the neighborhood of the manifolds of the\nsaddle point O is exponentially small. It may be said that the equilibrium distribu-\ntion function on the attractor has tails similar to those of a Gaussian distribution,\nand that the trajectory only rarely falls within these tails. Moreover, our reasoning\nthat the trajectory must come arbitrarily close to the saddle-point manifolds when\nt \u2192 \u221e is based on a theoretical analysis of the Lorenz system [Afraimovich et al.,\n1983], whereas numerical studies show that this probability is effectively zero for\nsufficiently long but finite computation times. This implies that the relaxation time\nto an equilibrium distribution on a quasi-hyperbolic CA is much longer than any\nrealistically feasible observation time. Consequently, for the Lorenz system, we have\n3 CHAOTIC ESCAPE OVER A FRACTAL BASIN BOUNDARY 9\nto investigate the dynamics of fluctuational escape within a finite time interval: the\nquestion of how the solution obtained depends on the initial conditions on the at-\ntractor, and on the noise intensity, still remains an open question (cf. the studies of\nnonequilibrium trajectories [Soskin, 1999]). However, the experimentally found es-\ncape scenario (see below) suggests that a decrease in noise intensity cannot result in\nqualitative changes of the escape trajectory. Thus, by using the prehistory approach\nfor the quasi-hyperbolic attractor we effectively reformulate the boundary task with\ninfinite time to the corresponding task with finite time. This reformulation results\nfrom the structure of the quasi-hyperbolic attractor and, on the basis of the results\nobtained we conclude that, for multi-stability in the Lorenz system, the boundary\nof the CA and those of the stable cycles coincide, i.e. the stable manifolds of the\nboundary cycles L1 and L2 are formed by manifolds of the saddle point O. The-\noretically, therefore, zero action is required to bring the system into the boundary\nset whereas, in practice, we need additional non-zero action to keep and move the\nsystem along the manifolds in the non-hyperbolic region of the CA. This latter fea-\nture means that noise significantly changes the tails of a quasi-hyperbolic attractor\nin the vicinity of a non-hyperbolic region.\n(ii) In the case of a non-hyperbolic attractor, its non-hyperbolicity plays an essential\nrole in the escape process. For a non-hyperbolic attractor, saddle cycles embedded\nin the attractor and basin of attraction are important. We found that the cycles\ninvolved in the escape have low period numbers and that the cycle corresponding to\nthe boundary condition on the attractor has a low residence probability in the ab-\nsence of noise. These observations allow us to claim that these cycles are connected\nwith the non-hyperbolic structure of the CA or with homoclinic tangencies (bifur-\ncations). The last conclusion is supported by observations first, that noise-induced\ndeformation occurs in the vicinity of homoclinic tangencies [Jaeger & Kantz, 1997]\nand, secondly, that the escape path from the non-hyperbolic attractor in the Henon\nmap lies in a small vicinity of the primary homoclinic tangency closest to the basin\nboundary [Kraut & Grebogi, 2004]; note, however, that the latter authors go be-\nyond the rigorous Hamiltonian theory by ignoring the questions about boundary\nconditions on the CA. Thus, for both quasi-hyperbolic and non-hyperbolic attrac-\ntors, escape trajectories are intimately connected with the non-hyperbolic structure\nof the attractors.\n3 Chaotic escape over a fractal basin boundary\nThe above results demonstrate that, in the case of a smooth basin boundary, a strong\nrelationship exists between the structure of a chaotic attractor and the structure of the\noptimal escape path. The problem of finding the boundary conditions would appear to\nbecome far more difficult where two co-existing CAs are separated by a fractal basin\nboundary (FBB). In this case, the complex fractal structure of the basin boundary is\ndetermined by a chaotic saddle: it results from homoclinic intersections of the stable\nand unstable manifolds of the regular saddle point, originally forming a smooth basin\nboundary.\nWe now consider the mechanism of fluctuational escape across an FBB. To model\nthe process, we examine the two-dimensional Holmes map driven by the zero-mean white\n3 CHAOTIC ESCAPE OVER A FRACTAL BASIN BOUNDARY 10\n-1.5 -1 -0.5\nx\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\ny\n(a)\nn\nn\nS3\nS3\nS3\nS1\n12\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52\nn\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nx\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36\nn\n-0.03\n-0.02\n-0.01\n0\n0.01\nn\n(b)\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n9\n10\nFigure 3: (a) The structure of phase space of (11) in Poincare\u00b4 section. One of the two co-existing CAs\nis indicated by the centrally-placed filled curve. Its basin of attraction is shown in white, whereas points\nbelonging to the other basin are shaded in blue. The most probable escape path connecting the CA with\nthe period-3 saddle cycle S3 lying on the fractal boundary is shown by the sequentially numbered small\ngreen circles (from solution of the boundary value problem) and stars (from Monte-Carlo simulations)\nconnected by the red dashed line. (b) The x-coordinates of the optimal escape paths shown in (a)\nwhich were obtained both from the Monte-Carlo simulations with D = 10\u22125 (dashed line) and from the\nsolution of the boundary value problem (solid line). The abscissa of the saddle point S1 is shown by the\nthin-dashed line. The inset shows the optimal fluctuational force moving the system (11) to the FBB.\nGaussian noise \u03ben of variance D:\nxn+1 = yn (11)\nyn+1 = \u2212b xn + d yn \u2212 y3n + \u03ben.\nWhen noise-free, the system (11) has pairs of co-existing attractors the basins of which\nare separated by a boundary that may be either smooth or fractal, depending on the\nchosen values of parameters. The properties of (11), including the structures both of its\nCA and of its locally disconnected FBB, are generic for a wide class of maps and flow\nsystems [McDonald et al., 1985]. We chose for our studies b = 0.2 and d = 2.7, which\ncorresponds to there being two co-existing CAs with basins separated by an FBB. Each\nCA consists of two disconnected parts and appears as the result of a period-doubling\ncascade. One of them is shown in Fig. 3(a).\nTo find the optimal escape path, we follow the above approach, exciting a numerical\nmodel of the system (11) with weak noise and collecting both the escape trajectories\nbetween the CAs and the corresponding realizations of noise that induced them. By\naveraging a few hundred such trajectories and noise realizations, we were able to determine\nboth the optimal escape path and the corresponding optimal force, which are presented\nin Fig. 3(b). It can be seen that the system (11) leaves the CA, falling into a small\nneighborhood of the saddle point of period 1 (S1) located between its two disconnected\nparts. Its stable manifolds separate the parts of the CA, while the unstable ones approach\nthe CA. The system then makes a few iterations in some small neighborhood of S1 (the\nsmall plateau in Fig. 3(b)) and then moves in three steps to the FBB, crossing it at the\nsaddle point of period 3 (S3). Calculations have shown that, for the chosen parameter\nvalues, S3 lies on the FBB. Moreover, its stable manifold (solid black line in Fig. 3) is\ndense in the FBB and detaches the open neighborhood including an attractor from the\nFBB itself, thus allowing us to classify it as an accessible boundary point [Grebogi et al.,\n1987; Silchenko et al., 2003b,a]. It should be noted that the boundary point S3 is the only\n3 CHAOTIC ESCAPE OVER A FRACTAL BASIN BOUNDARY 11\nsaddle point belonging to the homoclinic structure whose stable and unstable manifolds\nare not tangent to each other. All other homoclinic points are buried in the FBB and\ninaccessible from the open neighborhood including the CA, because of such tangencies.\nMoreover, in the absence of noise, S3 is the only saddle point on the FBB from which\nthe noise-free system (11) can relax to an attractor in a finite number of iterations. For\nall other initial conditions, taken at inaccessible saddle points, the noise-free system (11)\nmust stay inside the FBB for an infinitely long interval [Grebogi et al., 1987]. In other\nwords, the saddle point S3 is closest to the CA\u2019s homoclinic point whose stable manifold\nseparates the interior (including the CA) from the FBB. Thus, the results of this statistical\nanalysis allow us to determine both the boundary conditions near the CA and the FBB,\nand to demonstrate the uniqueness of the optimal escape path [Silchenko et al., 2003a,\n2005].\nFurthermore, an analysis of the structure of escape trajectories inside the FBB allows\nus to clarify the role of the homoclinic saddle points resulted from an infinite sequence of\nsaddle-node bifurcations of period 3, 4, 5, 6, 7..., at parameter values d3 < d4 < d5 < d6 <\nd7... [Grebogi et al., 1987]. These homoclinic orbits were classified as so-called original\nsaddles, and it was shown that their stable and unstable manifolds cross each other in a\nhierarchical sequence [Grebogi et al., 1987]. This deterministic structure of the manifolds\nof the original saddles is robust to noise and determines the escape paths inside the FBB.\nIndeed, to escape from a CA, the system must first cross the stable manifold of the acces-\nsible orbit, and then the stable manifolds of the other original saddles, in a predetermined\nhierarchical sequence. Once the system crosses the stable manifold of a saddle orbit it\nrelaxes noise-free to the corresponding orbit, which it then leaves along its unstable man-\nifold. We have shown that the hierarchical interrelation between original saddles involved\nin the escape is closely linked to the eigenvalues of the Jacobian at these saddles, char-\nacterizing their local stability with respect to motion on the manifolds [Silchenko et al.,\n2003a, 2005].\nTo find the MPEP connecting two co-existing CAs, we used the Hamiltonian formalism\ndescribed in Sec. 1. Minimization is performed over all the possible realizations of noise\n{\u03ben} that induce a transition of the system (11) from the CA (with the initial condition\non S1) to the FBB (with the final condition on the accessible orbit S3). It is equivalent\nto minimization of the auxiliary cost function (3) which results in the following area-\npreserving map:\nxn+1 = yn\nyn+1 = \u2212b xn + d yn \u2212 y3n + \u03bbyn (12)\n\u03bbxn+1 = (d\u2212 3x2n+1)\u03bbxn\/b\u2212 \u03bbyn\/b\n\u03bbyn+1 = \u03bb\nx\nn\nThe numerical results obtained for the system (12) are presented in Fig. 3(b). It can\nbe seen that the MPEP calculated via minimization of the energy functional practically\ncoincides with the optimal escape path obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations.\nThat the above results are generic has been confirmed by numerous studies of fluctua-\ntional transitions across FBBs in different dynamical systems. In particular, the described\nscenario of fluctuational escape was observed in all multistable systems whose basins of\nattraction in phase space are separated by locally-disconnected FBBs, which is the most\n4 CONCLUSION 12\nfrequently observed type of FBB [Silchenko et al., 2003a, 2005; Khovanov et al., 2006].\nMoreover, studies of fluctuational transitions in a dynamical system exhibiting a \u201cfractal-\nfractal\u201d boundary crisis showed that the accessible boundary point can effectively be\nmoved inside the domain of attraction [Silchenko et al., 2005]. It has therefore become\npossible to predict a scenario of escape through a fractal boundary using a determinis-\ntic analysis of the FBB structure. Furthermore, recent results [Kraut & Grebogi, 2004]\nhave shown that the boundary conditions at CAs can also be related to the homoclinic\nstructure, and thus found deterministically.\n4 Conclusion\nWe have described results which allow us to conclude that, for a large class of chaotic\nflows and maps, there exists a unique most probable path along which the system escapes\nfrom the basin of attraction of a chaotic attractor. This remains true for escape over\nboth regular and fractal basin boundaries. It is therefore possible to analyze the stability\nand control of chaotic systems in much the same way as in the case of escape from a\nregular attractor. A key problem in all such analyses is determination of the boundary\nconditions. In many situations they can be found directly through analysis of the geo-\nmetrical structure of the attractor and\/or of the boundary of its basin of attraction, thus\navoiding extensive numerical simulation. This applies, in particular, to escape via the\nprimary homoclinic tangenicies closest to the basin boundary, or via homoclinic structure\nin a fractal boundary.\nIn the more general case, however, we have to analyze real escape trajectories in\norder to specify boundary conditions. The prehistory approach is then very powerful.\nSuch analyses demonstrate that, in many cases, escape proceeds via a sequence of jumps\nbetween saddle cycles embedded in the chaotic attractor, in the basins of attraction, or in\nthe attractor boundaries. In turn the saddle cycles are closely connected with homoclinic\nstructures (bifurcations). We have found that the escape process depends significantly\non the type of chaotic attractor under consideration. Reaching a detailed understanding\nof the differences in escape from hyperbolic, quasi-hyperbolic, and different kinds of non-\nhyperbolic chaotic attractors remains a challenge and a direction of future investigation.\nReferences\nAfraimovich, V.
