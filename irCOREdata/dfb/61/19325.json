A pathological characteristic that is\ncommon to the diverse life-threatening syndromes that\ncan result from Plasmodium falciparum infection is the\nsequestration of large numbers of mature parasitized red\nblood cells (PRBCs) within the microvasculature of vital\norgans. Sequestration is generally attributed to cytoad-\nherence of PRBCs on microvascular endothelial cells\n[1]. However, postmortem studies have shown that in-\ntravascular PRBCs are not adjacent to the vascular en-\ndothelium [2], suggesting that some PRBCs may be ad-\nherent to each other rather than to the vascular\nendothelium and that they might have accumulated\nthrough a process of adhesion between PRBCs.\nPlatelet accumulation can be found in the cerebral\nmicrovessels of patients who died of cerebral malaria\n(CM) but not in those of patients who died of severe\nmalarial anemia (SMA), suggesting a possible role for\nplatelets in the pathogenesis of cerebral CM [3]. Platelets\ncan mediate the formation of PRBC clumps in vitro [4].\nThis phenomenon has been shown to be more common\nwhen parasites from patients with severe malaria, rather\nthan isolates from patients with mild malaria, are used,\nboth in Kenyan children [4] and in Thai adults [5]. The\nsize of the clumps observed in vitro is sufficient to be\nresponsible for important rheological disturbances in\ninfected patients, if the clumps are similarly sized in\nvivo.\nThrombocytopenia is a typical characteristic of P. fal-\nciparum infection. The degree of thrombocytopenia was\nfound to correlate with the risk of a fatal outcome in one\nstudy [6] but not in another [7].

We studied consecutively observed cases of uncom-\nplicated malaria (UM), SMA, and CM in patients who were ad-\nmitted to the pediatric research ward of the Queen Elizabeth\nCentral Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. The clinical characteristics\nof these patients are detailed in table 1. All patients with UM and\nSMA had P. falciparum parasitemia and were conscious (Blan-\ntyre coma score, 5 [of a possible 5]). These patients were consid-\nered to have UM if the packed cell volume was\u000125% and SMA\nif it was\u000212%. Patients with CM were admitted to the hospital\nin a coma (Blantyre coma score,\u00032), had P. falciparum parasi-\ntemia, and had no other clinically evident cause of unconscious-\nness. All of the patients with CM who were included in the\npresent study showed evidence of malarial retinopathy, a re-\ncently described finding that improves the accuracy of the clin-\nical diagnosis of CM (for review, see [8]). The patients\u2019 relatives\nprovided fully informed consent to participate in the study, and\na 2.5-mL blood sample was taken for parasite culture and sepa-\nration of plasma and platelets. The studies were approved by the\nethics review committees of the College of Medicine, University\nof Malawi (Blantyre); the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine\n(Liverpool, United Kingdom); and Michigan State University\n(East Lansing).\nParasite culture. Blood samples from patients were col-\nlected in sodium citrate tubes and centrifuged at 250 g for 10\nmin. Plasma was stored at 4\u00b0C, and pelleted RBCs were washed 3\ntimes in RPMI 1640 and then were resuspended in a standard\nmalaria culture medium of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 25\nmmol\/L HEPES, 10% fetal calf serum, and 40 mg\/mL gentami-\ncin, to achieve a final hematocrit of 5%. After cultivation at 37\u00b0C\nin 5% CO2 for up to 48 h, the parasite stages and numbers were\nadjusted to a 10% mature-form (the pigmented trophozoite\nstage) parasitemia by means of gelatin flotation, to standardize\nthe assays and compare the results. Blood smears were then pre-\npared, and the stage of parasite maturation was examined by\nmicroscopy.\nPreparation of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-\npoor plasma (PPP). PRP and PPP were extracted from 5 mL\nof whole blood provided by malaria-naive donors or from 2.5\nmL of whole blood obtained from patients with CM. Blood was\ncollected in a sodium citrate tube and centrifuged at 250 g for 10\nmin. The PRP fraction was then transferred to a new tube, and a\nplatelet count was performed with Neubauer\u2019s hematocytom-\neter before storage. PPP was obtained by further centrifugation\nperformed at 1500 g for 10 min to discard platelets, and both\nPRP and PPP were stored at 4\u00b0C and used within 4 days.\nClumping assays. Clumping kinetics (figure 1A) were as-\nsessed when the parasites had grown to the stage of pigmented\ntrophozoites and were selected as described above. Parasite cul-\ntures labeled by the addition of 20 mg\/mL acridine orange were\nthen rotated in 5% hematocrit in the presence of 20% PPP\n(platelet count, \u000210 platelets\/\u0001L) or 20% PRP (platelet count,\n\u0001300 \u0002 103 platelets\/\u0001L [for healthy donors] or \u0002150 \u0002 103\nplatelets\/\u0001L [for patients with CM]). After 15 min of rotation, 25\n\u0001L of sample was obtained, placed on a glass slide, and examined\nby fluorescent microscopy. Additional samples were obtained at\n30, 60, and 120 min, as described elsewhere [4]. A \u201cclump\u201d was\ndefined as \u00043 infected erythrocytes, and the frequency of the\nclumping phenotype in isolates was measured as the number of\ninfected cells in clumps among 1000 infected cells counted in\nduplicate assays. For the autoassays (figure 1B), PRP, PPP, and\ncultured parasites isolated from the same patient with CM were\nused (in vivo platelet count,\u0002150 \u0002 103 platelets\/\u0001L). Platelet\nnumbers were concentrated 5 times in plasma samples used for\nautoassays, so that, when mixed with parasite suspensions, the\nfinal concentration of platelets would be representative of the in\nvivo conditions. Platelet concentration was accomplished by\ngentle centrifugation, removal of a calculated portion of plasma,\nand resuspension of platelets. To assess the potential influence of\nplasma factors on clump formation, the same technique was\nused to adjust several platelet suspensions to a final average\nTable 1.

Clumping assays were then\nperformed according to the protocol for classic assays described\nabove.\nAnalysis of platelet activation in clumps. Variation of\nplatelet membrane P-selectin expression was measured by im-\nmunofluorescence on slides and by flow cytometry. Both were\nperformed on platelets alone in PRP obtained from patients with\nCM, as well as on clumps after 2 min of coincubation of PRP\nwith PRBCs. For the immunofluorescence studies, PRP alone or\nPRP after coincubation in clumping assays was incubated at\nroom temperature for 20 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate\u2013\ncoupled mouse anti\u2013 human CD62-P (P-selectin, clone\nJMCD62P; Orbigen) before observation with the use of a fluo-\nrescence microscope. Flow cytometric analyses required clumps\nof small or medium size, and the antibody was added, either 5\nmin before PRP analysis or after 2 min of PRP-PRBC coincuba-\ntion, for 5 min. In the latter case, the total of 7 min of coincuba-\ntion led to the formation of clumps of the desired dimension.\nInhibition of platelet-induced clumping by monoclonal\nantibodies. PRP samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with\nseveral blocking antibodies against platelet membrane glycopro-\nteins, such as CD36 (GPIV, clone FA6-152; Beckman Coulter\nImmunotech), P-selectin (CD62-P, clone AK-6; Serotec),\nGPIIb\/IIIa (CD41\/CD61 chimeric antibody, clone 7E3 [ReoPro;\nCentocor]; a gift from G. Wiemann), or IgG isotype control.\nLamifiban (Ro44-9883; Roche) (provided by J\u00fcrgen Fingerle of\nF. Hoffmann\u2013La Roche), a peptidomimetic synthetic GPIIb\/IIIa\ninhibitor, was also incubated with PRP for the same length of\ntime. PRP was then used in clumping assays performed as pre-\nviously described.\nStatistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed us-\ning Stata software (version 8.1; Stata). Data were analyzed using\nthe Mann-Whitney U test to compare pairs of groups. Results\nwere expressed as the mean value (\bSD) for individual experi-\nmental groups, and the clumping data for the different patient\ngroups were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn\u2019s\npairwise test. The correlation between parasite density and plate-\nlet count in table 1 was assessed using Spearman\u2019s correlation\ntest. P \u0003 .05 was considered to be statistically significant.\nRESULTS\nAssociation of platelet-induced PRBC clumping phenotype in\nchildren with severe malaria in Malawi. We assessed the\noccurrence of the previously described platelet-induced in vitro\nPRBC clumping phenomenon in Malawian children with P. fal-\nciparum malaria. Parasites isolated from 49 patients were stud-\nied; 12 of these 49 patients had UM, and, of the 37 patients who\nhad severe malaria, 15 had SMA and 22 had CM (table 1). In the\npresence of PPP from healthy donors, no PRBC autoagglutina-\ntion was observed in any of the patient groups after coculture for\n120 min (figure 2A\u20132C). When incubation with PRP was per-\nformed, however, the platelet-induced clumping phenotype was\nobserved in all groups. This phenomenon was time dependent\nand was associated with disease severity and type. Parasites iso-\nlated from patients with UM showed a weak ability to aggluti-\nnate in the presence of platelets, with 27.1%\b 12.0% of clumped\nPRBCs present at the end of the kinetics studies.\nMicroscopic analysis showed, for cases of UM, a homoge-\nneous suspension of PRBC, with some small clumps (8.6 \u0004 3.0\nPRBCs\/clump) randomly distributed (figure 2A). For cases of\nSMA or CM, autoagglutination was significantly higher than\nthat noted for cases of UM (at 60 min and after for SMA\n[P \u0003 .05 at 60 min;P \u0003 .001 for all of the other times] and at 15\nmin and after for CM [P \u0003 .001 for each kinetics point]).\nFor SMA, clumped PRBCs constituted 59.1%\b 14.1% of the\ntotal PRBC population at the end of the kinetic study, and\nsignificantly larger clumps were observed for SMA than for\nUM (42.9 \u0004 9.5 vs. 6.5 \u0004 4.3 PRBCs\/clump, respectively)\n(P \u0003 .001) (figure 2B). In the presence of platelets, parasites\nisolated from patients with CM exhibited a statistically stronger\nclumping phenotype than did parasites from patients with SMA\n(P \u0003 .001, for each kinetics point), leading to the formation of\ngiant clumps (\u000150 PRBCs\/clump) within the first 15 min of\nincubation and to the aggregation of all of the PRBCs in the\nsuspension. The number of PRBCs could not be counted pre-\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of clumping assays. Classic\nclumping assays were performed as described elsewhere [4, 5], with the\nuse of parasites that were isolated from infected patients, cultured, and\nincubated with platelet-poor plasma (PPP) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP)\nobtained from healthy donors with a normal platelet count (A). In\nautoassays, parasites, PPP, and PRP were all obtained from the same\npatient, to assess the potential for occurrence of this phenomenon ex\nvivo (B).

In each experiment, we used as controls un-\ninfected erythrocytes isolated from healthy and malaria-naive\ndonors, all of whom exhibited platelet counts within the range\nconsidered to be normal (150 \u0002 103 to 450 \u0002 103 platelets\/\n\u0001L). Cells were incubated with PPP or PRP that was obtained\nand processed as described in the experimental procedures, and\naggregation was never observed (data not shown).\nInvolvement of platelet activation and subsequent up-\nregulation of P-selectin in the clumping effect. To assess\nplatelet activation during clumping, we used immunofluores-\ncent staining to identify P-selectin on platelets both before and\nafter 10 min of coincubation with PRBCs. Samples were ana-\nlyzed using fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. Before\ncoincubation with PRBCs, platelets obtained from patients with\nCM did not show any sign of activation: they were of normal\ncircular shape (figure 3A). Flow cytometric analysis showed that\nthe gated platelet population had low P-selectin surface expres-\nsion, with a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 5.8% (figure\n3C and 3E). Within 10 min of the addition of PRBCs, platelets\nexhibited typical activation pseudopodia (figure 3B), and signif-\nicant up-regulation of membrane P-selectin was observed for\nthe platelet and clump populations, reaching an MFI of up to\n77.4% (figure 3D and 3F). Platelets not associated with clumps\n(figure 3D, gate [p]) exhibited an increased MFI of 49.9% (data\nnot shown). A control experiment was performed by mixing\nunparasitized erythrocytes with PRP, and neither platelet\nchanges nor uninfected erythrocyte clumping was observed\n(data not shown).\nTo investigate the potential role of platelet P-selectin as a re-\nceptor for PRBC in this aggregation phenomenon, PRP was then\nincubated in the presence of blocking anti\u2013P-selectin, as well as\nseveral other antibodies or antagonists against the platelet mem-\nbrane glycoproteins listed above, before undergoing incubation\nwith PRBCs isolated from patients with CM. In the presence of\nanti\u2013P-selectin, platelet-induced PRBC clumping was signifi-\ncantly but partially decreased, with 20.7% \b 11.0% inhibition\n(P \u0003 .001), compared with clumping noted for controls (figure\n3E). Incubation with anti-CD36 led to a dramatic reduction in\naggregation (67.3% \b 6.5%; P \u0003 .01), as described elsewhere\n[4], and a combination of both antibodies led to almost com-\nplete abrogation of clumping, with greater inhibition than the\nadditive effect of the antibodies taken separately (97.7% \b\n10.5%; P \u0003 .01). By contrast, the blocking of the platelet surface\nglycoproteins GPIIb and IIIa by high concentrations of ReoPro\nor Lamifiban (1\u201330 \u0001g\/mL and 50 \u2013100 ng\/mL, respectively),\nagents that are both known to block platelet aggregation [9],\nfailed to induce significant inhibition of PRBC aggregation\n(P \u0005 .05) (figure 3E). When platelets were inactivated by pre-\ntreatment with heparin to inhibit the up-regulation of P-selectin\non their surface (1000 U\/mL), the same level of inhibition re-\nported for anti\u2013P-selectin treatment was observed (data not\nshown).\nFigure 2. Ability to form clumps (defined as\u00013 parasitized red blood cells [PRBCs]) in the presence of platelets in parasite populations isolated from\npediatric patients in Malawi. Platelet-induced PRBC clumping is a common parasite phenotype among Malawian children and is associated with disease\nseverity. Parasites isolated from patients with uncomplicated malaria (n \u0006 12), severe malaria anemia (n \u0006 15), and cerebral malaria (n \u0006 22) were\nincubated for different times with plasma with or without platelets. Results are expressed as the mean percentage (\b SD) of PRBCs associated with\nclumps. Assays were performed twice for each patient sample.\nThrombocytopenia and Clumping in CM \u25cf JID 2008:197 (1 January) \u25cf 75\nRestriction of ex vivo clump formation by thrombocytope-\nnia in patients with CM. The occurrence of clump formation\nex vivo in the presence of thrombocytopenia was then evaluated\nby the use of PRP and PRBCs from the same patient with CM.\nHealthy donors who provided the PRP used in previous assays\nexhibited an average platelet count of\u0001300 \u0002 103 platelets\/\u0001L,\nwhereas all 22 patients with CM had thrombocytopenia, with\nplatelet counts of \u0002150 \u0002 103 platelets\/\u0001L at admission (table\n1). When incubated with PRP from the same patient with\nthrombocytopenia, PRBCs showed a significantly reduced\nclumping phenotype (mean percentage of reduction [\b SD] af-\nter a 120-min incubation step, 39.6% \u0004 19.4%). To assess\nwhether this clumping restriction was due only to the low plate-\nlet count and not to other circulating plasma factor(s) in these\npatients with CM, we adjusted the PRP to a final average platelet\ncount of \u0001300 \u0002 103 platelets\/\u0001L, by use of a low-\ncentrifugation step as described above. When PRP with an ad-\njusted platelet count was incubated with PRBCs, there was a\npartial but significant restoration of the clumping, reaching\n82.6% \u0004 11.6% after 120 min (P \u0003 .001) (figure 4). A control\nexperiment performed with PRP obtained from healthy donors\nwith a platelet count adjusted to disease-type concentration by\ndilution (60 \u0002 103 platelets\/\u0001L, as calculated in table 1) led to a\nsignificant decrease in clumping (data not shown).\nCorrelation of the degree of thrombocytopenia with the\ndensity of parasitemia in patients with CM in Malawi. The\nassociation between the platelet count and the density of parasi-\ntemia was investigated in the 3 patient categories (table 1). A\nnegative coefficient of correlation (\u00070.675) was found between\nthese 2 variables in the CM group, with Spearman\u2019s correlation\ntest showing strong statistical significance (P \u0003 .001). This as-\nsociation was not observed in patients with SMA or UM.\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study, we demonstrated that platelet-mediated\nPRBC clumping is a stable and common in vitro phenotype of all\nof the P. falciparum strains isolated from 49 infected Malawian\nchildren. We also showed that this phenotype is quantitatively\nassociated with disease severity and type, that the platelet mole-\ncules responsible for this effect are CD36 and P-selectin, and that\nthe degree of thrombocytopenia present in patients with CM is\nsufficient to limit the further formation of PRBC clumps in vitro.\nThe aims of the present study were, first, to document the\noccurrence of the platelet-induced PRBC clumping phenome-\nnon in parasites isolated from Malawian pediatric patients and,\nsecond, to assess its association with disease severity and type\n(UM vs. severe malaria, as well as SMA vs. CM). We demon-\nstrated clumping of PRBCs in the presence of PRP for all isolates\nrecovered from patients with malaria who were admitted to the\nward, irrespective of their clinical syndrome.

The level\nof membrane P-selectin expression was assessed by immunofluorescence\nperformed on slides (A and B ) and by flow cytometry (C, D, E, and F ). The\nmicrographs, dot plots, and histograms shown present the results observed\nfor 4 assays. The addition of PRBCs resulted in the generation of a platelet-\nPRBC clump population observed in dot plot D, and the platelet population\nthat was not associated with PRBCs was subgated in [p]. Inhibition assays\nwere then performed to evaluate the role of P-selectin and several other\nplatelet surface molecules in the parasite clumping phenomenon (G). Platelet-\nrich plasma (PRP) obtained from healthy donors was incubated with either\nIgG (control; 10 \u0001g\/mL), anti\u2013P-selectin (20 \u0001g\/mL), anti-CD36 (10 \u0001g\/mL),\na mixture of both anti\u2013P-selectin and CD36 (stated as \u201cMix\u201d), ReoPro\n(Centocor; 30 \u0001g\/mL), or Lamifiban (100 ng\/mL) before being used in clump-\ning assays with PRBCs from patients with cerebral malaria (CM).

Whether this association\nis causal\u2014that is, whether clumping contributes directly to\npathogenesis\u2014remains to be studied. For patients with CM, the\naddition of PRP to parasite cultures led to the formation of large\nclumps within only 20 min of incubation. The giant clump for-\nmation that we observed in vitro as a consequence of platelet and\nPRBC adhesion in patients with CM may, if it occurs in vivo,\nresult in the increased accumulation of PRBCs within the micro-\nvasculature of patients with CM, compared with that of patients\nwith other malarial syndromes [10]. The recently described ac-\ncumulation of platelets within the cerebral venules of Malawian\npatients with CM supports this hypothesis. Several patterns of\nplatelet distribution have been demonstrated by means of per-\noxidase immunostaining of cerebral tissue, some of which in-\nclude platelets clustered between parasite pigment in the whole\nlength of visible vessels [3], suggesting a clumping between\nplatelets and PRBCs. Platelets may also directly contribute to the\nadhesion of PRBCs to activated endothelium [11]. Uneven dep-\nosition of platelets may contribute to the observed disparate dis-\ntribution of sequestration in the microvasculature of patients\nwith CM [12].\nWe then further analyzed the role of platelet activation in the\nformation of clumps. Previous studies have shown that PRBCs\nare able to activate platelets [13, 14], leading to the immediate\ntransfer of the internal P-selectin (stocked in the platelet \u0007 gran-\nules) to its surface [15]. Because the presence of P-selectin has\nbeen described as a synergistic factor in the binding of PRBCs on\nendothelial CD36 [16], we hypothesized that platelet P-selectin\nwas likely to be involved in clump formation. Its expression on\nplatelet membranes increased dramatically during clumping,\nconfirming that platelets are activated by PRBCs. We also dem-\nonstrated, by use of inhibition assays, that P-selectin was in-\nvolved as a PRBC receptor in clump formation.\nThe other molecule shown to be involved in PRBC-platelet\nadherence in the present study was CD36. Both P-selectin and\nCD36 are expressed on platelets, and both are known to be re-\nceptors for PfEMP-1, the parasite protein expressed on the sur-\nface of PRBCs [17\u201320]. These findings are consistent with pre-\nvious studies [4] of CD36, but P-selectin has not previously been\nidentified as a receptor mediating platelet-PRBC clumping.\nWhen both CD36 and P-selectin were blocked by antibodies, the\nclumping phenomenon was abrogated, and our results suggest\nsynergism between the 2 receptors during clump formation.\nP-selectin has been reported to increase the adherence of\nPRBCs to CD36 on endothelium [16], and its substantial but\ntransient expression on PRBC-activated platelet surfaces may act\nas a trigger for the amplification of the clumping phenomenon.\nSuch a \u201cclumping-activation-clumping\u201d loop might explain the\nmassive aggregation observed in the early minutes of our assays\nwith CM-derived PRBCs. Platelet activation as a consequence of\nclumping formation in vivo would lead to a massive release of\ntransforming growth factor\u2013\b1, which is contained in the plate-\nlet \u0007 granules. This pleiotropic cytokine has recently been de-\nscribed to act as an inducer of apoptosis in endothelium in in-\nflammatory conditions; platelet activation in sequestration sites\nin vivo may therefore make additional indirect contributions to\npathogenesis [14].\nFinally, we investigated the possibility of a natural restriction\nof clumping associated with thrombocytopenia in patients with\nmalaria. The formation of giant clumps in vivo could be ex-\npected to lead to important rheological disturbances and mi-\ncrovessel occlusion, yet in vivo studies have suggested that se-\nquestration of PRBCs is not sufficient to block brain\nmicrocirculation in patients with CM [1, 21]. Because platelets\nseem to be a crucial element in clump generation, we investi-\ngated the effect of thrombocytopenia, exhibited by all of our\npatients with CM (table 1), on clump formation ex vivo. We\ndeveloped a new method of ex vivo coculture of different cell\ntypes (i.e., platelets and PRBCs) isolated from the same patient,\nFigure 4. Thrombocytopenia in patients with cerebral malaria (CM)\nand restriction of the formation of platelet\u2013parasitized red blood cell\n(PRBC) clumps (defined as \u00013 PRBCs) in vitro. For autoassays, PRBCs\nwere incubated in the presence of control platelet-poor plasma (PPP)\n(open circles) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) obtained from the same\npatient with CM (final platelet count, \u0002150 \u0002 103 platelets\/\u0001L) (filled\ncircles) or in the presence of PRP from the same patient but with a\nplatelet suspension adjusted to a normal platelet count (final platelet\ncount,\u0001300 \u0002 103 platelets\/\u0001L) (filled triangles).

Assays were performed 3 times for each sample obtained from\na patient with CM.\nThrombocytopenia and Clumping in CM \u25cf JID 2008:197 (1 January) \u25cf 77\nand we compared the effect of PRP from healthy individuals\n(average platelet count,\u0001300 \u0002 103\/\u0001L) with the effect of PRP\nfrom the same patient (average platelet count,\u0002150 \u0002 103\/\u0001L)\non clump formation. Plasma from patients with thrombocyto-\npenia failed to generate giant clumps, and an adjustment of the\nplatelet count to within the range considered to be normal in\nthese plasma samples led to the restoration of the phenomenon.\nThese results suggest that, in patients with malaria, thrombocy-\ntopenia may have the potentially beneficial effect of restricting\nclump formation in vivo, leading to less platelet activation and,\nthereby, modulating pathogenesis.\nThe degree of thrombocytopenia in pediatric patients with\nCM was significantly correlated with parasitemia (Spearman\u2019s\ncorrelation test, \u00070.675; P \u0003 .001) (table 1). A possible expla-\nnation for this correlation would be that thrombocytopenia re-\nsults from widespread clumping in sequestration sites, the de-\ngree of which is directly linked to the parasite burden of the\npatient. However, this hypothesis is not supported by experi-\nments in mice in which abrogation of the platelet trapping in\ncerebral microvasculature had no effect on the low platelet count\nof the animals [22]. Whatever the mechanism of thrombocyto-\npenia, it appears that, in human CM, the invariably low platelet\ncount may function as a protective mechanism for the host.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the staff of the Paediatric Research Ward, Queen Elizabeth Cen-\ntral Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi, for collecting samples; David Roberts, for his\nhelpful comments; and Jacqui Montgomery, for her logistic help during the\nstudy.
