Introduction\nThe Stanner Hanter Complex of the Welsh Borderland\nrepresents one of a small number of fault-bounded units\nthat make up the record of exposed crystalline basement of\nBritain, south of the Iapetus Suture. An Rb\u2013Sr isochron age\nof 702 \u00b1 8 Ma presented by Patchett et al. (1980) suggested\nthe complex to be the oldest of these tectonic inliers. This\npaper presents a new, high resolution U\u2013Pb age on zircon\nfrom the complex which, in combination with accompanying\nnew Sm\u2013Nd data, has resulted in a greater understanding of\nthe affinities of basement terranes in southern Britain.\n2. Regional tectonic framework\nThe Neoproterozoic basement of England and Wales is\ngenerally considered to comprise a collage of terranes that\nformed in close proximity to each other as component parts\nof the peri-Gondwanan eastern Avalonia microcontinent\n(e.g. Keppie et al. 2003; Strachan et al. 2007). Individual\nterranes described by Pharaoh et al. (1987) and Pharaoh\n& Carney (2000) include, from west to east, the Monian\nComposite Terrane, the Cymru Terrane, the Wrekin Terrane,\nthe Charnwood Terrane and the Fenland Terrane (Fig. 1).\nTheir existence as discrete tectonostratigraphic entities is\nlargely predicated on the presence of a series of significant\nstructural lineaments, interpreted as terrane boundaries,\nsupported by contrasts in the geochemical characteristics\nof volcanic successions entrained as tectonic inliers within\n\u2020Author for correspondence: dis@bgs.ac.uk\nthem (Pharaoh et al. 1987). The upper crustal expressions\nof the structural lineaments are marked by broad zones\nof faulting, including the Menai Straits Fault Zone, Welsh\nBorderland Fault System and Malvern Lineament (Fig. 1).\nNeoproterozoic basement rocks have also been proven in a\nlimited number of deep boreholes (e.g. Allen & Jackson,\n1978; Noble, Tucker & Pharaoh, 1993; Barclay et al. 1997;\nPharaoh et al. 1991).\nThe terranes themselves are thought to have formed during\ncycles of arc-related magmatism and sedimentary deposition.\nTogether these make up part of the record of assembly of West\nGondwana at around 765\u2013660 Ma and 635\u2013550 Ma (Nance,\nMurphy & Keppie, 2002; Nance et al. 2008 and references\ntherein). This included accretion of Avalonian-type and\nGanderean-type terranes against a composite West Africa\u2013\nAmazonia\u2013Baltica margin of Gondwana (Murphy et al.\n2004; Nance et al. 2008), recorded in southern Britain as\nthe c. 667\u2013650 Ma metamorphic event (Strachan et al. 1996,\n2007). Available isotopic data suggest that the Avalonian\nterranes of southern Britain were assembled together by latest\nPrecambrian to Early Cambrian times (Gibbons & Hora\u00b4k,\n1996; Strachan et al. 2007).\nHowever, the data from southern Britain in support\nof this tectonic assembly model are very limited, both\nin terms of paucity and distribution of exposure and\nantiquity of some of the isotopic studies. Indeed, the terrane\nboundaries in southern Britain, within which many of the\nLate Neoproterozoic rocks are entrained, are understood to\nbe long-lived structures influenced by several accretionary\ncycles (e.g. Woodcock & Gibbons, 1988; Kawai et al.\n2007; Schofield et al. 2008). Consequently, considerable\nscope exists for a more complex assembly process in which\ndisparate geological elements may have been combined\nand intercalated over a long period of geological time.\nAccordingly, this study, based on new isotopic data from\nthe Stanner Hanter Complex, represents part of an ongoing\nreappraisal of the terrane affinities of southern Britain.\n3. Geology of the Stanner Hanter Complex\nThe Stanner Hanter Complex forms an inlier of intrusive\nigneous rocks cropping out west of the village of Kington in\nthe Welsh Borderland (Fig. 1). It is contained within splays\nof the Church Stretton Fault, part of the Welsh Borderland\nFault System (WBFS), and was considered an exposure of\nthe basement to the Wrekin Terrane by Pharaoh et al. (1987).\nAlthough contacts are poorly exposed, the inlier is interpreted\nto be overstepped by strata of Silurian age on its southern\n146 RAPID COMMUNICATION\nFigure 1.

The\nfault is thought to preserve a long history of movement,\nincluding a significant inferred component of transcurrent\ndisplacement (Woodcock, 1988). Fault reactivation during\nthe Early Palaeozoic appears to have strongly influenced\nsedimentation in the region; indeed the angular unconformity\nbetween Longmyndian and overlying Cambrian rocks of\nthe nearby Wrekin hills (see below) provides evidence\nfor probable Late Neoproterozoic movements (Greig et al.\n1968), while an angular sub-Wenlock unconformity has\nbeen taken to indicate an episode of pre-Acadian (Early-\nto Mid-Devonian), probably Late Ashgill-age, tectonism\n(Woodcock, 1988; Woodcock & Gibbons, 1988).\nAlong strike to the northeast, the Church Stretton and\nPontesford Linley faults (or Pontesford Lineament, a basin-\nward strand of the Welsh Borderland Fault System) enclose\nadditional Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian age inliers\n(Fig. 3), which along with the Malvern Complex to the east\nmake up the entire exposure of the proposed Wrekin Terrane\n(Fig. 1). Recent interpretations (Pharaoh & Carney, 2000)\ntreat the units enclosed by the Welsh Borderland Fault System\nas a single tectonostratigraphic succession in which the\nStanner Hanter Complex preserves the oldest isotopic age.\nThe nearby Rushton Schist is reported to have a younger Rb\u2013\nSr whole rock isochron age of 667 \u00b1 20 Ma (Thorpe et al.\n1984), which along with the Primrose Hill Gneiss have\nbeen interpreted as metamorphosed sedimentary remnants\nof unknown protolith age.\nAdjacent to these, also located within splays of the Church\nStretton Fault, are a succession of acid, intermediate and basic\ntuffs and lavas of the Uriconian Group and intrusive Ercall\nGranophyre (Fig. 3). Rhyolite from the former has yielded a\nRAPID COMMUNICATION 147\nFigure 3. Geological map of the Wrekin terrane inliers after\nPauley (1991) and Pharaoh & Carney (2000). Co-ordinates are\nBritish National Grid.\nU\u2013Pb age of 566 \u00b1 2 Ma, while the Ercall Granophyre has\nbeen dated at 560 \u00b1 1 Ma (Tucker & Pharoah, 1991). The\nUriconian Group is overlain by a 6500 m thick succession\nof the Longmyndian Supergroup which has yielded a U\u2013\nPb age from tuff and bentonite within the succession\nof 555.9 \u00b1 3.5 Ma (Compston, Wright & Toghill, 2002).\nAlthough the nature of their relationship has been the matter\nof some debate, James (1952, 1956) argued that the presence\nof volcanic clasts similar to Uriconian lithologies demon-\nstrated an unconformable relationship between the two. The\nyoungest rocks of the Wrekin Terrane are represented by\na succession of Early to Middle Cambrian sedimentary\nrocks, the Wrekin Quartzite and Lower and Upper Comley\nsandstones. The Wrekin Quartzite comprises approxim-\nately 50 m of indurated shoreface sands (Wright et al.\n1993), which were recognized by Callaway (1879) and Cope\n& Gibbons (1987), on the basis of derived volcanic pebbles,\nas unconformably overlying the Uriconian Group. The age\nof the Wrekin Quartzite is poorly constrained to a Placentia\nSeries age (approximately 543\u2013520 Ma) on the basis of\na sparse shelly fauna (Brasier, 1989), while the overlying\nLower and Upper Comley sandstones have yielded a more\nextensive fauna spanning Branch to St David\u2019s series ages\n(approximately 520\u2013510 Ma; Rushton, Hamblin & Strong,\n1988; Greig et al. 1968).\nThe Stanner Hanter Complex comprises an assemblage of\nigneous rocks, dominated by basic lithologies but containing\nsignificant intermediate and acid components. Lithologies\nare generally highly altered and the complex itself is dissected\nby numerous faults (Fig. 2). Pocock & Whitehead (1935)\nrecognized similarities with the nearby Uriconian Group,\nalthough subsequent dating (Tucker & Pharoah, 1991) has\nshown it to be significantly younger than the Stanner Hanter\nComplex. Holgate & Hallowes (1941) recognized a four-\nfold division of sequentially emplaced lithologies, whereas\nJones (2000) identified the importance of magma mixing\nin the assembly of the complex. The oldest component, a\nfine-grained microgabbro, is interpreted as having intruded\ninto an unspecified host rock as a series of sills (Jones,\n2000) and forms the majority of the exposure of the inlier.\nThese were intruded by an array of coalesced, dyke-like\ngabbro sheets with prominent chilled margins. A larger\ngabbro body, exposed on Hanter Hill, has a low-angled basal\ncontact, preserves compositional layering which becomes\nconsiderably more leucocratic toward the top, and was\nconsidered by Jones (2000) as a remnant section through\na small magma chamber. Jones (2000) also interpreted\ninteraction of the gabbroic facies with the final phase of\nnarrow sheets of locally porphyritic, biotite microgranite\ncontaining abundant microgabbro xenoliths with strongly\ncuspate margins to indicate magma mixing and mingling. A\nphase of tourmaline mineralization within the main gabbro\nbody has also been linked to the intrusion of the final granitic\nintrusive phase (Holgate, 1977). Hydrous alteration of all the\nmagmatic facies is widespread.\n4. Isotope analysis\nZircon grains were separated from a sample of granophyric\ngranitic rock from the Stanner Hanter Complex. The sample\nwas collected from a small unit of the intrusive biotite\nmicrogranite facies exposed on the flanks of Hanter Hill\n[325253 257860]. The separated zircons were chemically\nabraded (Mattinson, 2005) and analysed at the NERC Isotope\nGeoscience Laboratories (NIGL), following the procedures\nof Noble, Tucker & Pharaoh (1993). Chemistry blanks were\n\u223c 2 pg, and uranium blanks were < 0.1 pg U. All results\nand errors were calculated following the methods of Ludwig\n(1993) and plotted using Isoplot\/Ex (Ludwig, 2003). Pb\nisotope ratios were corrected for initial common Pb in excess\nof laboratory blank using the model of Stacey & Kramers\n(1975). Results were calculated using the decay constants\nof Jaffey et al. (1971). Sm\u2013Nd whole-rock analyses were\nalso carried out at NIGL on two further samples from the\ncomplex, one of granitic rock sampled from Hanter Hill\n[324791 256845] and one of gabbro collected from nearby\nStanner Rocks [32617 3258282]. Data for both U\u2013Pb and\nSm\u2013Nd analyses are presented in Appendix Tables A1 and\nA2, respectively, available as supplementary material online\nat http:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/journals\/geo.\n5. Discussion\nOf six analysed zircon fractions, one is highly discordant,\nwith a 207Pb\/206Pb model age of c. 1035 Ma, indicating the\npresence of an inherited component. The remaining five\ngrains lie on concordia, and give a weighted mean 206Pb\/238U\nage of 710.8 \u00b1 1.5 Ma (95 % confidence limits), which is\ninterpreted to reflect the crystallization age of the latest,\ngranitic facies of the complex (Fig. 4). This age is similar\nto, and just within error of, the 702 \u00b1 8 Ma Rb\u2013Sr isochron\nage of Patchett et al. (1980), yielded from granitic rocks\ncollected from the adjacent Stanner Hill, and suggests that\nthe latter age also approximates to the age of crystallization\nof that facies.\nThe new zircon age confirms that the Stanner Hanter\nComplex therefore remains the oldest known outcrop of\nthe crystalline basement of southern Britain. The complex\nalso appears to have largely been unaffected by subsequent\nthermal events within the Wrekin Terrane, such as the\nc. 667 Ma metamorphic event preserved in the Rushton\nSchist, and 667\u2013650 Ma metamorphic event preserved in\nthe nearby Malverns Complex (Strachan et al. 1996, 2007).\nMuch of both western and eastern Avalonia is dominated\nby arc magmatic rocks ranging between 635 and 550 Ma\nin age (Nance, Murphy & Keppie, 2002). Importantly, the\nnew age data from the Stanner Hanter Complex confirms\nthat it represents one of a dispersed number of magmatic\nrelicts that together record an older, c. 765 to 650 Ma, cycle\nof arc magmatism (Nance, Murphy & Keppie, 2002) that\n148 RAPID COMMUNICATION\nFigure 4. U\u2013Pb concordia plot showing data from six\nzircon fractions. The error quoted on the age includes decay\nconstant errors and the MSWD incorporates concordance and\nequivalence.\ncritically relates the basement of southern Britain to other\nAvalonian-type terranes preserved along the Caledonian\u2013\nAppalachian Orogen. Examples from the Avalonian terrane\nof southern Newfoundland include: c. 687\u2013670 Ma calc-\nalkaline volcanic rocks of the Tickle Point Formation and\nFurbys Cove Intrusive Suite (Swinden & Hunt, 1991;\nO\u2019Brien et al. 1995); the c. 680 Ma Cinq Cerf\u2013Grey\nRiver gneiss terrane (Dunning & O\u2019Brien, 1989; Valverde-\nVaquero, Dunning & O\u2019Brien, 2006); the c. 760 Ma Burin\nGroup (Murphy et al. 2008); and c. 730 Ma felsic magmatic\nrocks of the Holyrood Horst on the Avalon Peninsula\n(O\u2019Brien et al. 2001). Early arc complexes of Nova Scotia\ninclude: the c. 676 Ma Stirling Belt (Bevier et al. 1993); the\nc. 700\u2013630 Ma volcanic rocks of the Creignish Hills (Keppie\n& Dostal, 1998); the c. 734 Ma calc-alkaline Economy\nRiver Gneiss (Doig, Murphy & Nance, 1993); and the\nproposed back-arc basin succession of the Gamble Brook\nFormation (Murphy, 2002). Beyond Avalonia, this phase\nof arc magmatism has been recorded by the c. 746 Ma\nPentevrian Complex of the Cadomian Terrane in France (Egal\net al. 1996).\n\u03b5Nd values of \u22120.3 (gabbro) to \u22121.2 (granitic rock)\nfrom the complex are slightly lower than estimated bulk\nearth compositions. Because ancient crustal material evolves\ntoward negative \u03b5Nd, the implication of these data is that the\nStanner Hanter magmas were generated either by reworking\nof pre-existing crust, or mixing of contemporary mantle-\nderived magma with much older crustal material. In the\nfirst case, TDM of 1393 Ma and 1469 Ma, respectively,\nfor the two samples would approximate to the age for\nthat source material. However, when taken together with\nanalyses from the Orton and Glinton boreholes of the\nFenland Terrane, which have yielded \u03b5Nd values of \u22124.03\nto \u22124.46 and TDM ranging from 1614 Ma to 1644 Ma (two-\nstage depleted mantle model ages, recalculated from Noble,\nTucker & Pharaoh, 1993), the Sm\u2013Nd data suggest that\nmixing of c. 700 Ma mantle-derived magmas with a more\nancient, Palaeoproterozoic or Archaean, source component\nis more likely. The analysed sample from the Stanner Hanter\nComplex contained one highly discordant zircon grain\n(online Appendix Table A1), which, if regressed through the\nintrusion age of 710.8 \u00b1 1.5 Ma, yields an upper intercept\nage of c. 1648 Ma. Clearly, little weight can be placed upon\nsuch highly discordant data, but this at least confirms the\npresence of more ancient crustal material in the Stanner\nHanter granite.\nThese data contrast with typical values for Neoproterozoic\nigneous rock from the western Avalonian terranes of New-\nfoundland and Nova Scotia, which typically have positive\n\u03b5Nd values and TDM< 1.0 Ga (e.g. Murphy et al. 2000).\nPrevious studies (e.g. Nance & Murphy, 1994; Murphy et al.\n2000) have argued against the presence of ancient basement\nas a source component to the Avalonian terranes, favouring\nderivation from relatively juvenile \u2018Grenvilian\u2019 age, c. 1 Ga,\nisland arcs or ocean plateaux formed during the assembly\nof the supercontinent of Rodinia. A more detailed study of\nthe age distribution of inherited zircon in the Stanner Hanter\ngranite would be required to test for the presence of such\nGrenville-aged material.\nSome Late Neoproterozoic palaeogeographic reconstruc-\ntions (e.g. Murphy et al. 2000) indicate that eastern Avalonia\nformed adjacent to the West African Craton. The latter is\nlargely characterized by magmatic rocks formed during the\nc. 2.1 Ga Eburnean orogenic cycle as well as older, Archaean\nphases of crustal growth and accretion. Continental crust of\nthis age is therefore the most likely potential source com-\nponent contributing to the evolved Sm\u2013Nd characteristics\nof the Late Neoproterozoic magmas of eastern Avalonia.\nAlthough not exposed in southern Britain, remnants of\ncratonic basement are preserved in other peri-Gondwanan\nterranes also thought to have originated adjacent to the\nWest African Craton terranes. These include the c. 2.1 Ga\nIcartian Gneiss and Svetlik Gneiss of Cadomia (Samson\n& D\u2019Lemos, 1998) and Bohemia (Wendt et al. 1993),\nrespectively. Indeed, the Stanner Hanter rocks lie within the\nrange of isotopic compositions for mixed source granitic\nmagmas from Cadomia (\u03b5Nd values of +1.6 to \u22121.9 and\nTDM ranging from 1.0 to 1.9 Ga; D\u2019Lemos & Brown, 1993)\nand illustrate the potential input of an ancient crustal source\nof similar age. Alternative palaeogeographic reconstructions\n(e.g. Samson et al. 2005; Strachan et al. 2007) suggest\nthat Avalonia was further around the Gondwanan margin,\nadjacent to the Amazon Craton, during Late Neoproterozoic\ntimes. This region is in part distinguished from the West\nAfrican Craton by the presence of Mesoproterozoic belts\nranging from around 1.6 to 1.0 Ga in age (e.g. Tassinari &\nMacambira, 1999), which overlap with the TDM values from\neastern Avalonia and provide another potential crustal source\nregion to the Stanner Hanter Complex.\nIn conclusion, it should be noted that apparent fundamental\nisotopic differences in source composition between eastern\nand western Avalonia highlighted by these new data are\nbalanced against similar, bi-partite cycles of arc magmatism\nand accretion that distinguish the Avalonian type from other\nperi-Gondwanan terranes (Keppie et al. 1991). These data\nshow that a more thorough investigation of the terrane and\npalaeogeographic affinities of eastern Avalonia is called for,\nrequiring a more comprehensive isotopic dataset than is\ncurrently available.\nAcknowledgements.
