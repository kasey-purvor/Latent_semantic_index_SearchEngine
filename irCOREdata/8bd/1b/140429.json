If the weld metal and\nheat affected zone are anodic to the parent material then localised metal loss can\ntake place in those regions (1). An example of severe preferential weld corrosion\n(PWC) in a pipeline containing hydrocarbons and brine saturated with carbon dioxide\n(2) is shown in Figure 1. This problem is accentuated by the small surface areas of\nthe weld metal and heat-affected zones compared to the large area of the parent\npipe material. In contrast, if the weld metal is selected to be slightly noble to the\n2parent material then it will remain cathodic and this can be expected to reduce\ngalvanic corrosion of the weld metal and distribute it instead over the large area of\nthe parent material. In practice, additions of Ni and Cr are often made to the weld\nmetal to increase its strength and these have the further effect of providing a more\nnoble potential (3). Galvanic corrosion is not the only consideration in weld corrosion,\nhowever, and even cathodic weld metals containing 1%Ni have been reported to\ndisplay preferential metal loss due to a high rate of self-corrosion (3).\nThe microstructure is another factor that influences the corrosion behaviour. For\nexample, the heat affected zone has the same composition as the parent material\nbut its modified microstructure can lead to accelerated corrosion. It has been shown\nthat preferential weld corrosion in carbon steels is accelerated by increasing the\nhardness, the grain size and the proportion of aligned second phase in the weld\nmetal (4). Matching weld consumables, with the same composition as the parent\nmaterial, have been shown to give the best resistance to PWC, whereas both 1%Ni\nand 1% Si additions are detrimental.\nRecent research has shown that it is more difficult to inhibit corrosion of high nickel-\ncontaining weld metals (5). In some cases, addition of an inhibitor caused a reversal\nof the galvanic current and this would appear to explain the reported incidence of\npreferential weld corrosion when those weld consumables had been used.\nWeld corrosion has been investigated by a range of experimental techniques. Mini-\nelectrochemical cells have been used carry out polarisation measurements across\nthe different regions of the weld (6,7). Other studies (8) have employed scanning\nvoltage electrode techniques (SVET) and localised electrochemical impedance\nspectroscopy (LEIS). Galvanic current measurements have generally been achieved\nby sectioning the weld to produce individual electrodes of weld metal, heat affected\nzone and parent material, attaching wires to carry the currents and assembling them\nin resin, prior to exposing them to the corrosive conditions (2-5,9). The flow rate of the\nelectrolyte is an important factor in CO2 corrosion and in some studies the\nhydrodynamic conditions have been controlled using a flow channel (10), a re-\ncirculating flow loop (5) and rotating cylinder electrodes (2,9).\nThe aim of the work described in this paper was to investigate the conditions under\nwhich galvanic current reversal takes place and to explain why the addition of a\ncorrosion inhibitor appears to cause these changes. A novel rotating cylinder\nelectrode was designed to operate at speeds up to 5000 rpm and record galvanic\ncurrent measurements under hydrodynamic conditions representative of flow in a\npipe. In addition, the self-corrosion rates of the different regions of the weld were\nmeasured by separating each electrode in turn and performing linear polarisation\nresistance (LPR) scans and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).\nEXPERIMENTAL\nWelded pipeline steel\nAll tests were carried out on samples machined from welded X65 steel pipe with the\ncomposition shown in Table 1. The steel had been thermomechanically controlled\nrolled to give a 32mm thickness and a hardness of 200-210 Hv. The longitudinal\n3double-vee pipeline weld had been produced by the submerged arc process, with a\nrelatively high heat input (5-10 J\/mm) giving a hardness of 223-230 Hv. The\ncomposition of the weld metal is also given in Table 1 and was similar to that of the\nparent material, except for the addition of 0.68% Ni and smaller quantities of Cr and\nMo. A sample was cut from the weld, polished and etched to identify the positions of\nthe parent material, heat affected zones and weld metal, as shown in Figure 2.\nMicrographs of each region and a micro-hardness profile across the weld are shown\nin Figure 3. The microstructure of the parent material consisted of fine equiaxed\nferrite with small amounts of pearlite. The fine-grained HAZ was similar in\nappearance, having slightly larger equiaxed ferrite and a small quantity of an aligned\nsecond phase. The coarse grained HAZ displayed acicular ferrite that had formed\nthroughout the enlarged prior austenite grains. In the weld metal, primary ferrite had\nformed on prior austenite grain boundaries, with a finer aligned microstructure within\nthe grains.\nRotating Cylinder Electrodes\nElectrochemical corrosion rate measurements were carried out using a rotating\ncylinder electrode (RCE) produced from the different regions of the weld (11). An\nadvantage of using the rotating cylinder electrode is that the hydrodynamic\nconditions are very well defined and it is feasible to translate the conditions that are\nknown to exist in a production pipeline to those used in laboratory tests (12,13).\nHowever, there appears to have been little attempt to use this method for\ninvestigating weld corrosion due to the technical difficulties of making multiple\nelectrical connections to rotating electrodes, consisting of three or more different\nregions of a weld.\nThe RCE consisted of hollow cylindrical samples, which were machined from each\nregion of the weld (parent material, heat affected zone and weld metal) and had\nwires attached to carry the electrochemical signals. The three component parts\nwere electrically isolated from each other by PTFE spacers, assembled onto an\ninsulated shaft and secured with a retaining nut, as shown in Figure 4. The areas of\nthe exposed parent material (PM), heat affected zone (HAZ) and weld metal (WM)\nwere in the ratio 8:1:2 to represent the approximate proportions of each region in the\nvicinity of a typical pipeline weld. Clearly, in a pipeline there would be very large\nareas of parent material further from a weld but these are considered to have a\nlesser effect on localised corrosion due to the greater ionic path involved.\nA set of high quality, multi-element slip rings were mounted on the motor driven shaft\nto take the electrical signals from the weld components to the electrochemical\ninstrumentation. The slip rings had a maximum dynamic resistance of 10 milliohms\nso that electrical noise was very low and the assembly was rated for speeds of\n13,000 rpm, well above the maximum of 5000 rpm used in this study.\nThe wall shear stress, \u03c4 RCE , in the liquid at the rotating electrode surface was\ncalculated from the following equation (14).\n\u03c4 RCE = 0.079 Re-0.3 \u03c1 r2 \u03c92 [1]\n4where Re is Reynolds number for the flow, \u03c1 is the liquid density, r is the radius of\nthe RCE and \u03c9 is its angular velocity.\nElectrochemical measurements\nGalvanic currents The galvanic currents between each weld region were recorded\nevery sixty seconds during the test using a multi-channel zero resistance ammeter\n(ACM Instruments GalvoGill 12) connected to a data logging PC. The currents from\nthe parent material to the weld metal and from the HAZ to the weld metal were\nrecorded on two channels and, as the three electrodes were in the short-circuit\ncondition, their individual galvanic currents were established from the following\nrelationship;-\nIPM + IHAZ + IWM = 0 [2]\nSelf-Corrosion Rates The self-corrosion rates of the three weld regions were\nmeasured by uncoupling each electrode of the RCE in turn and carrying out linear\npolarisation resistance measurements (LPR) using a platinum gauze secondary\nelectrode, a standard calomel reference electrode and a Sycopel Electronics AW2\nlow noise potentiostat. The potential of each weld component was scanned 10 mV\nabove and below its open circuit value, at a scan rate of 10 mV min-1, and the current\nresponse was recorded. The polarisation resistance, Rp, was obtained from the\nbest-fit gradient of the potential\/current graph and the corrosion current, ICORR, was\nthen found from the equation;-\nICORR = B \/ RP [3]\nwhere B is a constant for the material and its environment, taken as 13 mV (15). Due\nto the very small potential perturbation applied, the polarisation resistance method\ncan be repeated over long periods without changing the behaviour of the steel\nsignificantly from its freely corroding condition.\nThe total corrosion rates of the three weld regions were found from the sum of their\nself-corrosion rate and galvanic corrosion rate.\nElectrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) In addition to LPR\nmeasurements to record self-corrosion rates, EIS was used in some experiments to\ninvestigate the corrosion mechanism and identify components of the equivalent\ncircuits describing the corroding metal surfaces. In particular, it was used to\nmeasure the resistance of surface films that resulted from either the corrosion\nprocess or the action of the inhibitor. The measurements were carried out using a\nGill AC potentiostat from ACM Instruments with a 10mV signal ranging in frequency\nfrom 20 KHz to 5 mHz.\n5Experimental Conditions\nThe experiments were carried out at ambient temperature (20\no\nC) and at 50\no\nC and\n70\no\nC in a cell containing artificial seawater, saturated with carbon dioxide. Particular\ncare was taken in preparing the electrode surface before the test and in maintaining\noxygen free conditions in the electrolyte as these were found to be important in\nobtaining reproducible results. In each test, the RCE was held stationary for the first\nten hours, during which time a stable dark grey film developed on the electrode\nsurfaces. The RCE was then rotated for 20 minutes at 500 rpm while one of the\nelectrochemical techniques was employed. The measurements were repeated with\nthe speed increased to 1000 rpm and then in steps of 1000 rpm up to 5000 rpm. In\none experimental run, galvanic currents were recorded at 1 minute intervals while in\nothers polarisation resistance measurements or EIS scans were carried out in the\nstatic condition and at each rotational speed. The experiments were generally\nrepeated one or more times.\nThe same methodology was used to study the corrosion behaviour of each weld\nregion in seawater in both the uninhibited condition and when containing\nCORRTREAT 05-193, an oilfield corrosion inhibitor supplied by Clariant Oil Services.\nThe inhibitor consisted of a blend of neutralising amines and synergists in a\nwater\/glycol based solvent package. In each case, it was used at a concentration of\n30 ppm by volume, which is typical of oilfield practice (5).\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nGalvanic Current Measurements\nUninhibited Conditions The parent material and the HAZ were both anodic (+ve\ncurrents) to the weld metal at each test temperature. The results for the ambient\ntemperature condition are given in Figure 5. The currents gradually decreased over\nthe first 600 minutes due to the formation of the dark grey surface film, which\nappeared to be partially protective. Clearly, it was favourable for the weld metal to be\nthe cathodic component in the couple as this condition ensured that its corrosion rate\nwas reduced by sacrificial protection of the other weld regions. Typical open-circuit\npotentials of each weld region in uninhibited seawater at 5000 rpm, shown in Table\n2, confirm that the weld metal was the most noble component of the couple at the\nthree test temperatures. The potentials differed by only a few millivolts but this was\na consistent and reproducible trend in each experiment.\nUnder fluid flow conditions, the galvanic currents increased approximately linearly\nwith the rotational speed of the RCE. It could be seen from the visual appearance\nthat the rotation caused partial removal of the film. It is significant that the currents\nshown in Figure 5 remained higher after the rotation period, when the film had been\nthinned or removed, than they had been immediately beforehand, again supporting\nthe view that the film was partially protective.\nAlthough the anodic current measured on the parent material was larger than that on\nthe HAZ, when the different electrode areas were taken into consideration their\n6current densities were very similar. This is not surprising as they had the same\nelemental composition and differed only in their microstructures.\nInhibited Conditions The galvanic currents that resulted from the addition of 30 ppm\nof oilfield corrosion inhibitor displayed different behaviour to those in uninhibited\nseawater and the results obtained in ambient conditions are shown in Figure 6.\nDuring most of the pre-exposure period the parent material was again anodic to the\nweld metal but, as expected in inhibited conditions, the current was much reduced\n(20 \u00b5A for the initial value compared to 150 \u00b5A for the uninhibited case). The initial\ncurrents decreased rapidly over the first hour as an inhibitor film developed on the\nelectrode surfaces.\nWhen the electrode was rotated, the presence of the inhibitor caused a marked\nchange in the galvanic corrosion behaviour. A rapid current reversal took place with\nthe weld metal and HAZ both becoming anodic to the parent metal. The galvanic\ncurrent was particularly high on the weld metal at the highest rotational speed,\nsuggesting that the inhibitor film was more adversely affected by flow on this material\nthan on the other weld regions. It is thought that the high shear stress caused\npreferential removal of the inhibitor film from the weld metal, leading to an active shift\nin its potential. This situation is undesirable and would be expected to result in\nlocalised weld corrosion of the type that has sometimes been reported to occur in\nservice (2). However, when the RCE rotation was stopped the galvanic currents\ndecreased very rapidly to their previous level, suggesting that complete film removal\nhad not occurred.\nIn some tests at the highest rotational speed, a second current reversal took place,\nwith the weld metal returning suddenly to the cathodic behaviour that it had\ndisplayed in the uninhibited conditions. An example of this situation is shown in\nFigure 7. It appears that the second current reversal occurred as the result of a\nchange from the inhibitor film being disrupted preferentially on the weld metal to it\nbeing removed from all regions of the weld. In consequence, the ranking of the\nopen-circuit potentials of the different weld regions reflected their behaviour in the\nuninhibited conditions, with the weld metal being the most cathodic. The small\ndifferences in the open-circuit potentials in inhibited conditions at 5000 rpm in Table\n2 show the weld metal to be the most noble component and it is assumed that in\nthese high shear stress experiments complete film removal had taken place.\nSelf-corrosion rates\nUninhibited conditions The self-corrosion rates, measured by LPR, displayed a\nsteady increase over the range of rotational speeds. At ambient temperature, the\nrates were similar for the three weld regions and approximately doubled from\nstationary conditions (0.6 mm\/y) to the highest flow rate at 5000 rpm (1.2 mm\/y). At\n50\no\nC and 70\no\nC there was a smaller increase with flow rate (close to 50%) but the\ncorrosion rates of the weld metal exceeded those of the parent material and HAZ (by\nabout 30% at 50\no\nC and more than 100% at 70\no\nC). The self-corrosion rates\nmeasured at 5000 rpm are summarized in Figures 9 and 11.\nInhibited conditions At ambient temperature the addition of the inhibitor reduced the\nself-corrosion rates to approximately 1% of their previous values and at 50\no\nC and\n770\no\nC the rates were still only 3% of the uninhibited levels. Figure 8 shows that\nIncreasing the rotational speed of the RCE had little effect until 3000 \u2013 4000 rpm\n(shear stress of 30 - 48 Nm-2) when, unlike the uninhibited case, there was a marked\nincrease in corrosion rate, which suggests that the inhibitor was being detached. At\nambient temperature and 50\no\nC the highest rate occurred on the HAZ but at 70\no\nC the\nweld metal was greatest. The parent metal had the lowest self-corrosion rate in the\ninhibited solution at all temperatures.\nIn addition to having the highest self-corrosion rates, the HAZ and weld metal had\nbeen the anodes in the galvanic corrosion tests in inhibited conditions. However, as\nranking the order of corrosion rates in the three weld regions differed with\ntemperature it is unlikely that microstructural differences alone are the explanation.\nRather, it appears that the cause was differences in surface protection related to\ninhibitor film formation, with poorer film properties occurring on the weld metal and\nHAZ than on the parent material.\nTotal corrosion rates\nUninhibited conditions The total corrosion rate of each weld region can be\nconsidered to be the sum of its self-corrosion and galvanic corrosion rates. The\nvalues at 5000 rpm in uninhibited conditions for the three test temperatures are\ncompared in Figures 9 and 10. The overall pattern of behaviour of the weld\ncorrosion was very consistent at each temperature but showed an increase in rate as\nthe temperature was raised above ambient.\nOn all regions of the weld, the galvanic contribution was much smaller than the self-\ncorrosion rate. This is not surprising as carbon-manganese steel is inherently\nsusceptible to high self-corrosion rates in carbonic acid, whereas the small\ncompositional and microstructural differences between the weld regions would not\nbe expected to cause large galvanic currents.\nSignificantly, the cathodic galvanic current on the weld metal reduced its total\ncorrosion rate so that it was the lowest of the three weld regions at ambient and\n50\no\nC, although it remained the highest at 70\no\nC. In effect, the weld metal was\npartially protected by sacrificial corrosion of the parent material and the HAZ. It is\ninteresting to note that the weld metal had the highest self-corrosion rates at 50\no\nC\nand 70\no\nC yet it also had the most noble potential, as it was the most cathodic in the\ngalvanic current measurements. Clearly, the three weld regions had differences in\nboth microstructure and chemical composition and these are likely to have affected\nthe self-corrosion rates and galvanic currents in different ways.\nInhibited conditions The total corrosion rates at the three test temperatures are\ncompared in Figures 11 and 12. Unlike the uninhibited case, the galvanic\ncontribution was large in comparison to the self-corrosion rate, particularly at 70\no\nC.\nDue to the cathodic behaviour of the parent material, following current reversal, its\ntotal corrosion current was negative, meaning that it would be fully protected from\ncorrosion in the area adjacent to the weld. Note that at greater distances from the\nweld in a pipeline, the galvanic contribution would be smaller and some corrosion of\nthe parent material would be expected.\n8The high anodic galvanic current on the weld metal was the main factor in it having\nthe highest total corrosion rate at 70\no\nC. (The galvanic component was more than\nthree times the self-corrosion rate). This behaviour, shown in Figures 11(c) and 12,\nappears to explain the incidence of preferential weld corrosion of pipelines in\ninhibited conditions that is sometimes reported to occur in service, as this\ntemperature and flow rate represent typical pipeline operating conditions. The total\ncorrosion rate is not as high as would occur in the absence of an inhibitor (Figures\n9(c) and 10) but it is much more localised, occurring only on the weld metal and\nHAZ, and the rate of approximately 1mm\/yr for the weld metal is sufficient to have\nbeen the cause of these cases.\nThe observation of increased galvanic currents between the weld regions at the high\nflow rates and at higher temperatures, in a way that did not occur at low flow rates\nand ambient temperature, strongly supports the view that these galvanic effects are\nbrought about by differences in the formation and attachment of inhibitor films on\neach weld region. It is further evidence that a less protective film was formed on the\nweld metal and HAZ than on the parent material and, in consequence, this behaviour\nwould have contributed to severe localised corrosion of the weld.\nClearly, in circumstances when a second current reversal took place and the inhibitor\nfilm was detached from all regions of the weld, localised weld corrosion would not be\nexpected to occur. Therefore, preferential weld corrosion can be regarded as the\nresult of unstable conditions in which only partial inhibitor film removal occurs. It\nwas to investigate the properties of the inhibitor films that electrochemical impedance\nspectroscopy was carried out.\nElectrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)\nUninhibited conditions Figure 13 shows the Nyquist plot obtained for the parent\nmaterial upon initial immersion in uninhibited solution under static conditions at\nambient temperature and consists of a single depressed semicircle. The high\nfrequency end of the plot intersected the x-axis near the origin as the solution\nresistance of the seawater was very low (approximately 10 ohms). The charge\ntransfer resistance, obtained from the difference between the two points of\nintersection, was close to 550 ohms cm2, corresponding to a corrosion rate of\napproximately 0.27 mm\/y.\nAfter 10 hours immersion under static conditions, during which time a dark grey film\nformed on the surface, the plot changed to that shown in Figure 14. It again\nconsisted of a single depressed semicircle, well defined at high frequency, but there\nwas some influence of diffusion control at low frequency, as shown by the \u2018tail\u2019 in the\nlast few data points. The charge transfer resistance had increased to 770 ohms cm2,\nsuggesting that the corrosion rate had been lowered slightly by the presence of the\nfilm.\nInhibited conditions Figure 15 shows the Nyquist plot for parent material under\ninhibited conditions at 50\no\nC, again after 10 hours exposure and with the RCE rotated\nat 5000 rpm to give the most severe flow conditions. The plot was distinctly different\n9from those obtained in uninhibited conditions, with the partial appearance of a\nsecond semicircle at high frequencies. Whereas the resistance and capacitance of\nthe dark grey corrosion product film, which formed without the inhibitor, was\ninsufficient to affect the Nyquist plot, the more protective nature of the inhibitor film\nproduced a second semicircle, although it was partially merged with the main\nsemicircle associated with charge transfer resistance, rather than being fully\nresolved (16). The high frequency semicircle is shown at higher magnification on\nFigure 14 plot B and a curve fit suggests the resistance of the inhibitor film on the\nparent material at 50\no\nC to have been close to 4200 ohms cm2. The corresponding\nplot obtained at 70\no\nC is shown in Figure 16 in which the inhibitor film was still in\nevidence but its resistance had decreased to approximately 1500 ohms cm2.\nThe inhibitor film resistance was measured from the Nyquist plots for each weld\nregion at both 50\no\nC and 70\no\nC and the results are compared in Figure 17. It is clear\nthat the inhibitor film that formed on the parent material was of higher electrical\nresistance and therefore more protective than that on the weld metal and HAZ.\nThese differences appear to offer a feasible explanation for the high rates of self-\ncorrosion observed on these two weld regions.\nComparison between EIS and LPR results\nIt should be noted that EIS measurements are closely related to those obtained by\nLPR. At the scan rate of 10 mV\/min used in this study each LPR measurement was\nequivalent to a single impedance measurement at a frequency of 4 mHz. The\nmeasured polarisation resistance was therefore a combination of solution resistance,\nfilm resistance and a contribution, if not all, of the charge transfer resistance.\nTherefore, with these limitations in mind, the EIS and the LPR results can both be\nregarded as a measure of the self-corrosion rate of each weld region.\nIt was shown that the weld metal and HAZ, which had the highest rates of self-\ncorrosion and total corrosion, formed inhibitor films with low resistance, compared to\nthat on the parent material. The charge transfer resistances on these weld regions\nwere also lower than on the parent material, confirming the higher rates of self-\ncorrosion.\nRole of corrosion product films\nThe dark grey film that formed on the RCE under uninhibited conditions was\nexamined by x-ray diffraction and shown to consist predominantly of Fe3C, with\nsmaller quantities of FeCO3. In each region of the weld, the microstructure of the\nlow carbon steel consisted of ferrite and iron carbides and the corrosion that had\ntaken place in the carbonic acid had selectively removed the ferrite phase, leaving a\nnetwork of iron carbide. As a result, the film had an open, porous structure, as\nshown in Figure 18, which explains why it offered little corrosion protection. In order\nfor FeCO3 films to form on the surface, it is necessary for sufficient Fe2+ ions to be\npresent in the solution. Videm (17) found that at 70\no\nC, 50 ppm of Fe2+ were required\nto produce a protective corrosion product film that would reduce the corrosion rate of\ncarbon steels from 5 mm\/y to 2 mm\/y. However, in the present study it was shown\nfrom mass balance calculations that the Fe2+ ion concentration reached only 2.8 ppm\n10\nat the end of the experiments and this is thought to be the reason that protective\nsulphide films did not form (18). Where such films do occur, the operating\ntemperature is an important factor, as the stability and protectiveness of the films has\nbeen shown to increase at temperatures above 60\no\nC (19).\nThe importance of surface films in enhancing preferential weld corrosion under\ninhibited conditions has been reported by other researchers (20). Pre-corrosion, prior\nto addition of the inhibitor, appeared to hinder mass transfer to the metal surface,\nreducing inhibitor efficiency and extending the time for it to become effective. The\nalloy content of the steel is also thought to affect the composition of the films that\nform, both in freely corroding and inhibited conditions. The addition of 1%Ni to the\nweld metal has been widely used to overcome localised corrosion of welds in water\ninjection systems, as well as improving strength and toughness. However, 1%Ni\nadditions have been shown to accentuate the problem of preferential weld corrosion\nin CO2 containing brines (21). While metallurgical control of the welding procedure\ncan be used to limit the extent of preferential weld corrosion, no weld metal\ncomposition was found to be completely immune from this form of attack.\nAlthough the above factors may have an important influence, the work described in\nthe present study has shown that the preferential weld corrosion was caused not by\ndisparities in the properties of the corrosion product films but by the different\nprotectiveness of the inhibitor films that formed on each region of the weld.\nCONCLUSIONS\n[1] In uninhibited conditions the weld metal was cathodic to the parent material and\nHAZ. This reduced the total corrosion rate of the weld metal as it was partially\nprotected by the sacrificial corrosion of the other two weld regions.\n[2] The addition of an oilfield corrosion inhibitor caused a current reversal at high\nflow rates. The inhibitor film was removed preferentially from the weld metal, so that\nit became strongly anodic and lead to a condition that would result in severe\nlocalised weld corrosion.\n[3] In some cases, under high shear stress conditions, removal of the inhibitor film\ntook place on all weld regions and a second current reversal occurred, with the weld\nmetal again becoming the most noble weld component. It appears that preferential\nweld corrosion is caused by unstable conditions in which the inhibitor film is\nselectively disrupted on the weld metal but remains effective on the other weld\nregions.\n[3] The total corrosion rates of each weld region could be considered in terms of\ntheir separate galvanic and self-corrosion components. In the absence of an\ninhibitor, the corrosion rates were dominated by the self-corrosion behaviour,\nwhereas the presence of the inhibitor increased the galvanic contribution, particularly\non the weld metal.\n[4] Localised corrosion was shown to be most severe in inhibited conditions at 70oC\nand high flow rates, which is typical of conditions found in oil and gas pipelines. The\n11\nhigh shear stress reduced inhibitor coverage and EIS measurements showed that\nthe inhibitor films had lower electrical resistance and were less protective on the\nweld metal and HAZ than on the parent material\nAcknowledgement\nThe research described in this paper was supported by Clariant Oil Services.\nREFERENCES\n[1] C.Avendano-Castro, R.Galvan-Martinez, A.Contreras, M.Salazar, R.Orozco-\nCruz, E.Martinez & R.Torres-Sanchez, Corrosion kinetics of pipeline carbon steel\nweld in aqueous solution containing H2S, Corrosion Engineering, Science and\nTechnology, Vol 44, No 2, pp 149-156 2009.\n[2] G.I.Winning, N.Bretherton, A.McMahon & D.McNaughtan, Evaluation of weld\ncorrosion behaviour and the application of corrosion inhibitors and combined\nscale\/corrosion inhibitors, NACE Corrosion 2004, New Orleans, 28 March \u2013 1 April\n2004.\n[3] S.Turgoose, J.W.Palmer & G.E.Dicken, Preferential weld corrosion of 1% Ni\nwelds: effect of solution conductivity and corrosion inhibitors, Corrosion 2005, Paper\n05275, (Houston, Texas: NACE International, 2005).\n[4] C-M.Lee, S.Bond & P.Woollin, Preferential weld corrosion: effects of weldment\nmicrostructure and composition, Corrosion 2005, Paper 05277, (Houston, Texas:\nNACE International, 2005).\n[5] E.Gulbrandsen & A.Dugstad, Corrosion loop studies of preferential weld\ncorrosion and its inhibition in CO2 environments, Corrosion 2005, Paper 05276,\n(Houston, Texas: NACE International, 2005).\n[6] F.Martin, C.Garcia, P.Tiedra, Y.Blanco & M.Lopez, Application of\nminielectrochemical cell to corrosion studies of welded joints of austenitic stainless\nsteel, Corrosion Engineering Science and Technology, Vol 43, No 4, pp 343-352,\n2008.\n[7] G.Garcia, M.P.de Tiedra, Y.Blanco, O.Martin & F.Martin, Intergranular corrosion\nof welded joints of austenitic stainless steels studied by using an electrochemical\nminicell, Corrosion Science, 50, 2390-2397, 2008.\n[8] G.A.Zhang & Y.F.Cheng, Micro-electrochemical characterization of corrosion of\nwelded X70 pipeline steel in near-neutral pH solution, Corrosion Science, 51, 1714-\n1724, 2009.\n[9] A.Chalmers, I.G.Winning, D.McNaughtan & S.McNeil, Laboratory development\nof a corrosion inhibitor for a north sea main line offering enhanced environmental\nproperties and weld corrosion protection, Corrosion 2006, Paper 06487, (Houston,\nTexas: NACE International, 2006).\n12\n[10] K.Fushimi, A.Naganuma, K.Azumi & Y.Kawahara, Current distribution during\ngalvanic corrosion of carbon steel welded with type-309 stainless steel in NaCl\nsolution, Corrosion Science, 50, 903-911, 2008.\n[11] K.Alawadhi, M.Robinson, A.Chalmers & G.Winning, Inhibition of weld corrosion\nin flowing brines containing carbon dioxide, Corrosion 2008, Paper 08622,\nNew Orleans, March 16-20, 2008, (Houston, Texas: NACE International, 2008).\n[12] M.Bilson & K.Bremhorst, Comparison of turbulent scalar transport in a pipe and\na rotating cylinder, Third International Conference on CFD in the Minerals and\nProcess Industries, CSIRO, Melbourne, Australia, 10-12 December 2003.\n[13] D.R.Gabe, G.D.Wilcox, J.Gonzalez-Garcia & F.C.Walsh, The rotating cylinder\nelectrode: its continued development and application, J.Applied Electrochemistry 28,\n759-780 (1998).\n[14] D.C.Silverman, Rotating cylinder electrode \u2013 geometry relationships for\nprediction of velocity-sensitive corrosion, Corrosion, 44, 42 (1988).\n[15] S.Nesic, J.Postlethwaite & S.Olsen, An electrochemical model for prediction of\ncorrosion of mild steel in aqueous carbon dioxide solutions, Corrosion, 52, 280-294\n(1996).\n[16] G.W.Walter, A review of impedance plot methods used for corrosion\nperformance analysis of painted metals, Corrosion Science, Vol 26, 9, 681-703\n(1986).\n[17] K.Videm, The influence of pH and concentration of bicarbonate and ferrous ions\non the CO2 corrosion of carbon steels, NACE Corrosion\u201993, Houston, Texas, paper\n83 (1993).\n[18] J.L.Mora-Mendoza & S.Turgoose, Fe3C influence on the corrosion rate of mild\nsteel in aqueous CO2 systems under turbulent flow conditions, Corrosion Science,\n44, 1223-1246 (2002).\n[19] O.A.Nafday & S.Nesic, Iron carbonate scale formation and CO2 corrosion in the\npresence of acetic acid, NACE Corrosion 2005, paper 05295 (2005).\n[20] D.McNaughtan & I.G.Winning, Comparison of segmented weld corrosion tests\nwith short and long pre-corrosion and the influence of synergist in corrosion\ninhibitors, 1st International Symposium on Oilfield Corrosion, Aberdeen, UK, 28 May\n2004, paper 87553.\n[21] D.Queen, Chi-Ming Lee & J.Palmer, Guidelines for the prevention, control and\nmonitoring of preferential weld corrosion of ferritic steels in wet hydrocarbon\nproduction systems containing CO2, 1st International Symposium on Oilfield\nCorrosion, Aberdeen, UK, 28 May 2004, paper 87552.\n13\nC Mn Ni Cr Mo Si Al Cu V P S\nPipe 0.08 1.6 0.04 0.02 0.01 0.3 0.04 0.02 0.05 0.009 0.0005\nWeld 0.08 1.4 0.68 0.03 0.33 0.3 0.03 0.02 0.04 0.01 -\nTable 1.
