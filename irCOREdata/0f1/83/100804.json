Mairaj, R.J. Curry and D.W. Hewak\nThe fabrication of optical chalcogenide glass thin films through\ninverted deposition and high velocity spinning is presented. Good\nquality films up to 275 mm thick of this infrared transmitting material,\nwith propagation loss of 0.3 dB cm\u00011 at 1.064 mm, were engineered\nusing this technique.\nIntroduction: The increasing sophistication of the industries requi-\nring optical thin films from unconventional materials calls for alter-\nnative fabrication methods. Thin film for use in broadband and\nnarrowband filtering applications, including dense wavelength divi-\nsion multiplexing (DWDM), optical amplification, switching, modu-\nlation of light signals, grating based devices, infrared light\ntransmission, focusing, and as antireflection coatings are just some\nof the target areas, although other technological sectors including\ndisplays, aerospace, biomedical and defence have requirements. For\nthe infrared (IR) transmitting family of glasses, in particular chalco-\ngenides, several techniques for the production of thin films have been\nreported [1, 2]. Chalcogenide glasses (ChGs) contain elements from\ngroup VI of the periodic table as glass-forming anions and are\ngenerally opaque in the visible, with the exception of some sulphide\nglasses. The transmission window for ChGs extends from 1 mm to\nlonger infrared wavelengths compared with oxide and fluoride\nglasses. The high-refractive index, enhanced mid-IR transmission in\nChGs with reduced maximum phonon energy and ability to exhibit\nlocalised reversible or irreversible material changes when irradiated\nwith light suggest these glasses are indeed interesting candidates for\nthin film development [3]. In this Letter we report the first steps in\nrealising amorphous thin films in a ChG (gallium lanthanum sulphide,\nGa:La:S) utilising the inverted deposition of the molten phase\ncombined with high velocity spinning.\nExperimental procedure and results: The Ga:La:S family of glasses\nhave optical transparency between 0.5 and 10 mm (at 50% transmis-\nsion through 1 mm), a high glass transition temperature (Tg) of 580\n\u0002C,\nthey can be easily doped with rare earth, transition and precious\nmetals (e.g. silver and platinum) and exhibit photosensitive proper-\nties. Fabrication of the substrates used in the experiments, with a\ntypical molar composition 72.5Ga2S3:21.5La2S3:6La2O3, was carried\nout from prepared batches of powder precursors processed within our\nlaboratories with a purity exceeding 99.999%. These glass precursors\nwere loaded into a vitreous carbon crucible while in a controlled\nnitrogen atmosphere. The precursors are non-volatile at the glass\nmelting temperature (1150\u0002C for up to 24 h) and were heated in an\nopen (argon purged) atmosphere, after which the melt was quenched\nand annealed. Each substrate shaped as a disc had a diameter and\nthickness of 29\u0003 2 mm, respectively, and was optically polished on\nthe top and bottom face. An optically flat polish on the material\ndeposition surface is essential as this enhances interfacial uniformity\nbetween the deposited film and substrate. The deposited glass had\nmolar composition 70Ga2S3:24La2S3:6La2O3 with increased material\npolarisability providing \u00feDn of 0.005 over the refractive index of the\nsubstrate glass. To function effectively as an optical waveguide, it is\ncrucial that the deposited film is amorphous. Therefore, the separation\nof the peak (Tp) and the onset of crystallisation temperature (Tx) is\nrequired to be broad (>25\u0002C). A narrow separation (<25\u0002C) suggests\na well-defined crystalline event which will have structural prevalence\nover any amorphous lattice configuration. However, careful optimisa-\ntion of glass former, modifier and stabiliser content can result in\nsignificant suppression of crystal phases and favour the formation of\nan amorphous structure within the cooling thin film. These tempera-\nture events were characterised utilising a calibrated differential\nthermal analyser (Perkin Elmer DTA 7). A measured value of 52\u0002C\nfor the Tp\u2013Tx figure and an observed weak exothermic crystalline\nevent (Tp) for the substrate glass suggest sufficient resistance\nto crystallisation. The deposited glass composition had a measured\nTp\u2013Tx value of 31\n\u0002C in addition to a weak exothermic crystalline\nevent (although more prominent than the substrate glass) and\nwas considered to be suitably crystallisation resistant. The thermal\nexpansion coefficients for the Ga:La:S glass substrate and deposited\nfilm were measured, utilising a calibrated thermal mechanical analyser\n(Perkin Elmer TMA 7), to be within \u00040.2\u0003 10\u00016\u0002C\u00011 of each other.\nDisparate thermal expansion coefficients between the substrate and\ndeposited film can result in structural damage during cooling to\nambient conditions.\nThe fabrication of amorphous thin films of Ga:La:S glass involved\nthree stages, as shown in Fig. 1. The first stage involves the deposition\nof the coating fluid (molten glass) onto the substrate surface which is\nheld in place by a boron nitride vacuum chuck. A crucible containing\nmolten glass (\u00051250\u0002C) makes slight contact with the substrate\nsurface. The preheated Ga:La:S glass substrate (\u0005540\u0002C) is dipped\napproximately 1 mm into the molten Ga:La:S glass. It is vital that the\nsubstrate surface is completely wet with molten glass during this stage.\nNormally a substantial excess of coating fluid is deposited compared\nwith the final film thickness. During the second stage the substrate is\nwithdrawn, within 200 ms after contact, from the molten glass surface\nbut still positioned within the walls of the crucible. The excess molten\ndeposited glass on the substrate surface forms a meniscus as it drips\nback into the crucible. Positioning the substrate as such is a precau-\ntionary stage as any molten glass expelled from the substrate surface\nduring the third stage (spin cycle) is collected within the crucible. The\nthird stage is typically characterised by the expulsion of deposited fluid\nfrom the substrate surface through a rotational motion. The substrate is\naccelerated to a preset angular velocity for a specified duration and\nwhen spinning at a constant rate viscous forces dominate fluid thinning.\nThe crucible is fully withdrawn from the substrate 2 s after the spin\ncycle has started. This reduces the effects of thermal radiation,\nemanating from the hot crucible and molten glass, affecting fluid\nflow and retarding the quench of the deposited film. The deposited\nmolten film thins out and cools until the viscosity is too high for further\nflow to occur. Following the third stage, the substrate and deposited\namorphous film are annealed at 540\u0002C for 1 h and then slowly cooled,\nat 1\u0002C min\u00011, to an ambient temperature.\nmolten glass\nstage 1 deposition\nboron nitride\nvacuum chuck\nsubstrate\n(cladding glass)\nmolten\nmeniscus\nwithdrawal of substrate\nstage 2 withdrawal stage 2 withdrawal\nspinning of molten glass\nthin film\nis formed\nFig. 1 Three-step process for inverted deposition spin coating of thin film\nglass waveguides\nThe sensitivity of a thin film to the environment during fabrication\nhas some bearing on its quality. A critical variable is humidity and\nchanges will vary quality of the deposited film. Deformation can\nmanifest itself as film roughness, micro cracking and exaggerated\nformation of striations. In this work, experiments were carried out\nentirely in air, although it is desirable to maintain a self-contained inert\nprocessing environment. In Fig. 2 a micrograph obtained using an LEO\n430 scanning electron microscope (SEM) shows a Ga:La:S glass\nsubstrate with a 275 mm amorphous deposited higher refractive index\nGa:La:S film. The film quality is observed to be excellent without the\nformation of bubbles, cracks or similar imperfections. The deposition\ncondition for the amorphous film was spin velocity of 2500 rpm for 10 s\nwith surface uniformity variation <0.5 mm across 25 mm (profiled with\na Tencor atomic force microscope). Significantly, crystallisation was\nobserved neither in the deposited layer nor in the distinct interface\nbetween the deposited film and substrate. The film thickness as shown\nin Fig. 2 was reduced to 80 mm (surface uniformity variation <0.5 mm\nacross 25 mm) using a spin velocity of 3500 rpm for 15 s. The absence\nof any micro and macro cracking indicates that a for the studied glasses\nare well matched. However, a tolerance of up to a\u00bc \u0004 1.5\u0003 10\u00016\u0002C\u00011\nis expected, thus allowing use of suitable commercially available\nsubstrates. The stoichiometric similarity between the deposited film\nand bulk glass was verified with an energy dispersive X-ray microscope\n(EDAX) and the measurements revealed compositional accuracy within\n\u00045%.

In Fig. 3, a spun\nthin film, planar optical chip and glass substrate from the Ga:La:S\nglass system are shown. The planar optical chip has been cut from the\nspun thin film and can be scaled in size to suit an application. In\ndemonstrating this technique we have developed a chalcogenide glass\nthat can be quenched in air without oxygenation or devitrification\noccurring. As such, we believe that this technique can be developed\nfurther to deposit thin films of this glass for a variety of industrial\napplications.\nAcknowledgments: The authors acknowledge contributions from\nD.
