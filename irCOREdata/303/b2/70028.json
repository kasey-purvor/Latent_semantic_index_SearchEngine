(Orthography, spelling reform, language ideological debates, stan-\ndardization, linguistic norms, German language, late modernity.)*\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\nIn late 1995, a press release by the German Standing Conference of Ministers\nfor Education and Cultural Affairs \u2013 the Kultusministerkonferenz or KMK \u2013\nannounced that a reform of German orthography had been approved. The pro-\nposed changes were an attempt to harmonize what was perceived to be a com-\nplex and inconsistent set of orthographic rules that caused unnecessary problems\nfor language users of all ages, but particularly for young schoolchildren. The\nreform was to be introduced from 1 August 1998 to coincide with the start of\nthe new school year, and this would be followed by a seven-year transitional\nperiod until 2005, during which time the old orthography would be considered\n\u201coutdated\u201d (\u00fcberholt) but not \u201cwrong\u201d ( falsch). However, many Federal states,\nor Bundesl\u00e4nder, chose not to delay the implementation of the reform until\nLanguage in Society 31, 549\u2013576.

The\nfirst, and hitherto only, set of official guidelines for all the German-speaking\ncountries had been agreed to in 1901. The final proposal for their revision in 1996\nwas the result of almost a century of often heated debate among educationalists,\nlinguists, politicians, writers, journalists, and other interested parties. Nor was\nthe 1996 reform an exclusively German affair: From the late 1970s in particular,\nthere had been close liaison between what were then the four main German-\nspeaking states \u2013 the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Re-\npublic, Austria, and Switzerland \u2013 with the reform process facilitated to some\nextent by the unification of Germany in 1990. At various points, there had also\nbeen input from Liechtenstein, the only other country with German as its sole\nofficial language, and from German-speaking groups in Belgium, Luxembourg,\nDenmark, Italy, Romania, and Hungary. On 1 July 1996, representatives from\nmany of these countries, together with German, Austrian, and Swiss officials,\nmet in Vienna to sign the so-called Viennese Declaration of Intent, or Wiener\nAbsichtserkl\u00e4rung, thereby agreeing to implement the new guidelines.\nAlthough the disputes surrounding the state-sanctioned standardization of\nGerman orthography had never entirely abated since they first began in the\nmid-19th century, by the time the Viennese Declaration was signed in 1996, a\nnew round of protests had already been gathering momentum. In May of that\nyear, Rolf Gr\u00f6schner, professor of law at the University of Jena, and his 14-\nyear-old daughter took their case against the reform to the Federal Constitu-\ntional Court, or Bundesverfassungsgericht (BVerfG) in Karlsruhe. Although the\ncourt rejected their claim that the reform was at odds with the \u201cGerman Basic\nLaw\u201d (Grundgesetz), their highly publicized campaign helped to rekindle what\ncan probably be characterized as traditional public antipathy toward the idea of\northographic reform. In October 1996, a group of eminent writers and intellec-\ntuals, including the Nobel laureate G\u00fcnter Grass, signed a petition circulated at\nthe annual Frankfurt Book Fair by the Bavarian schoolteacher Friedrich Denk;\nthis protest attracted considerable media coverage, culminating in a cover story\nin the German news magazine Der Spiegel (14 October 1996). In November\n1996, Denk then went on to form a national \u201ccitizens\u2019 action group\u201d (B\u00fcrger-\ninitiative), entitled \u201cWE [the people] against the spelling reform\u201d (WIR gegen\ndie Rechtschreibreform), the aim of which was to topple the reform via a series\nof regional referendums (see Johnson 1999, 2000).\nT H E O R E T I C A L A N D H I S T O R I C A L C O N T E X T\nLanguage ideological debates\nIn this article, I propose that the 1996 reform of German orthography and the\npublic protests it inspired are a prime example of what Blommaert 1999 has\nS A L LY J O H N S O N\n550 Language in Society 31:4 (2002)\ncalled a language ideological debate. Blommaert (1999:1\u201312) describes\nsuch debates as occurring in specific times and places where real social actors\nhave collectively disputed the nature and function of language. These social ac-\ntors, or ideological brokers, can be then said to have engaged in the produc-\ntion and reproduction of language ideologies, \u201csets of beliefs about language\narticulated by users as a rationalisation or justification of perceived language\nstructure and use\u201d (Silverstein 1979:193). At the same time, such ideological\nbrokering can be theorized in terms of \u201cbids\u201d for authoritative entextual-\nization (Silverstein & Urban 1996:11) \u2013 as concrete attempts to secure closure\nin a given debate, whereby a particular language ideology would eventually come\nto be seen as more or less natural and inevitable (Blommaert 1999:9).\nWriting at the beginning of the 1990s, Woolard notes that \u201cthe topic of lan-\nguage ideology may be one much-needed bridge between work on language struc-\nture and language politics, as well as between linguistic and social theory\u201d\n(1992:236). However, Blommaert\u2019s point of departure for the analysis of lan-\nguage ideological debates is his contention that, although there is now a sub-\nstantial literature on language ideology generally (see, inter alia, Joseph & Taylor\n1990, Kroskrity, Schieffelin & Woolard 1992, Schieffelin, Woolard & Kroskrity\n1998, Kroskrity 2000), and historians of language have similarly touched upon\nrelated issues, \u201cthe historiography of language ideologies is something\nthat remains to be constructed\u201d (1999:1, emphasis in original). In any attempt to\nunderstand how and why some views of language gradually emerge as dominant\nwhile others are suppressed and marginalized, we need to attend to the histori-\ncal processes that inform the dynamics of social power as these obtain in spe-\ncific debates over language (see also Milroy 2001).\nCentral to the historiographical approach advocated by Blommaert is the re-\njection of an \u201cidealist\u201d view of language that treats phenomena such as attitudes\nand ideologies as something language users merely \u201chave,\u201d since this results not\nonly in their de-historicization but also in the mystification of the power pro-\ncesses underpinning them. Instead, Blommaert argues for a particular type of\nmaterialist view of language, which entails \u201can ethnographic eye for the real\nhistorical actors, their interests, their alliances, their practices, and where they\ncome from, in relation to the discourses they produce\u201d (1999:7). This, in turn,\nallows the theorist to expose the historical contingency of ideational phenomena,\nthereby contributing to their demystification. Such an approach does not, how-\never, posit ideologies as coherent belief systems somehow epistemologically coun-\nterpoised to the \u201ctruth,\u201d but rather as a convergence of multiple and fluid\n\u201cdiscourses that have specific consequences for relations of power at all levels\nof social relationships\u201d (Barker & Galasinski 2001:66, emphasis in original). In\nthis sense, all individuals and social groups hold ideologically informed be-\nliefs \u2013 linguistic or otherwise \u2013 but \u201cthe difference between the dominant and\nsubordinate groups is one of degrees of power and differing substantive world\nO N T H E O R I G I N O F L I N G U I S T I C N O R M S\nLanguage in Society 31:4 (2002) 551\nviews, not of ideological versus non-ideological ideas\u201d (Barker & Galasinski\n2001:66).1\nAfocus on orthography lends itself particularly well to the kind of historical-\nmaterialist approach to language ideologies advocated by Blommaert. Moreover,\nit is in tune with an emerging sociolinguistic literature that emphasizes the con-\ntingent nature of orthographic practices generally. Sebba (1998a:35\u2013 40), for ex-\nample, describes how the dominant view of orthography has traditionally been\nthat of a neutral, technical accomplishment the primary function of which is little\nmore than the \u201creduction of speech to writing.\u201d Yet, drawing on Street\u2019s (1984)\ndistinction between \u201cautonomous\u201d and \u201cideological\u201d views of literacy, Sebba\nargues that an autonomous approach to orthography similarly masks the deeply\nideological nature of the choices made by real social actors in the historical de-\nvelopment of writing conventions. In his study of British Creole, for example,\nSebba 1998a illustrates the ways in which a number of writers of Caribbean\norigin have tried to capture in written form a variety of speech for which there is\nno standard orthography. Especially interesting are the choices made by such\nwriters in those cases where there is no phonemic motivation for adopting a\nspelling that diverges from that of the lexifier language, English, e.g. ^tuff& \u2018tough\u2019\nor ^dhu0duh& \u2018do\u2019 (Sebba 1998a:27). This suggests that Caribbean writers are\nchoosing spellings that will actually construct a difference between British\nCreole and standard English in order to emphasize their own distinctiveness from\nmainstream cultural practices.\nSimilar uses of orthography as a means of styling both Self and Other in de-\nbates over ethnic, regional, and0or national identities have been explored in the\ncontext of Scots English (McClure 1985), Indonesian and Malaysian (Vik\u00f8r 1988),\nEnglish Creole in Trinidad and Tobago (Winer 1990), Louisiana French (Brown\n1993), Haitian Creole (Schieffelin & Doucet 1994), Manx (Sebba 1998b), Nor-\nfolk dialect (Trudgill 1999), and Corsican (Jaffe 1999). And whereas Clark &\nIvanic (1997:195\u2013211) critically explore the use of spelling and punctuation as a\nmeans of disciplining language users at school and beyond whereas Kress 2000\nfocuses on the emergent writing practices of young children as these attempt to\nmarry the desire to use orthography as an expression of personal creativity, on the\none hand, with the pressure to conform to mainstream practices, on the other (see\nalso Kataoka 1997). Finally, in a special edition of the Journal of Sociolinguis-\ntics, Jaffe 2000 and her contributors (Androutsopoulos, Miethaner, Jaffe and Wal-\nton, Berthele, and Preston) explore many of the assumptions underpinning the\nuse of nonstandard orthographies as a means of representing nonstandard speech,\nthereby highlighting the ideological nature of transcription processes more gen-\nerally in the construction, conscious or otherwise, of social identities.\nInevitably, perhaps, much of this recent work in sociolinguistics and linguistic\nanthropology tends to focus on orthographic practices in the context of emergent,\nnonstandard, or endangered varieties of written language, since these present\nparticularly exciting opportunities for observing the production of ideologies,\nS A L LY J O H N S O N\n552 Language in Society 31:4 (2002)\nand the construction of social identities, against the backdrop of an often tense\nrelationship with mainstream standards. Such opportunities are arguably less ev-\nident, however, when we consider varieties of written language that are already\nhighly standardized and widely used, for it is here that what Milroy & Milroy\n1999 refer to as \u201cstandard language ideology\u201d is probably at its most pervasive\n(see also Milroy 2001). And even though, as Cameron (1995:39) has noted in her\ndiscussion of the \u201cpolitics of style,\u201d standardization processes can never be en-\ntirely finished; once a standard variety has been widely accepted, diffused, pre-\nscribed, and codified, to use Haugen\u2019s (1972) classic terms, notions of orthographic\n(in)correctness can appear so utterly self-evident that their status as common\nsense is often considered literally beyond debate. Therefore, it is perhaps pri-\nmarily when such conventions are subject to a form of re-standardization (Schiff-\nman 1998:362; Joseph 1987:174), as in the 1996 reform of German, that popular\nawareness of the contingency of everyday usage resurfaces, and language ideo-\nlogical debates in the public domain are triggered once again (Vik\u00f8r 1988).\nThe 1996 reform: Historical background\nThe explicit involvement of state authorities in questions of German orthography\ndates back to the mid-19th century, when differing guidelines were first drawn up\nfor schools in various parts of the German-speaking areas (Mentrup 1993:17\u2013\n18). With increasing importance accorded to dictation in the teaching of lan-\nguage and literacy, the differences between these guidelines were inevitably a\nproblem for any pupil or teacher who moved from one area to another.2 But the\ngrowing sense that something had to be done about such orthographical variabil-\nity was not motivated primarily by linguistic or even pedagogic considerations.\nDespite the range of regional traditions, the ability of readers to decipher texts\nfrom areas other than their own was largely unaffected, and within each area there\nwas still a high degree of orthographic consistency.As Sauer (1988:85) has noted,\nthe main impetus for the standardization of German orthography was political.\nWith the unification of the German Empire by Bismarck in 1871, and with con-\ncomitant attempts to build a modern nation-state, came the perceived need for\nstandardization in many areas of social life \u2013 currency, weights and measures,\npostal services, railways, education, and the legal system \u2013 of which language,\nincluding orthography, was an integral part.3\nHowever, the process of reform would never be straightforward (see Schlaefer\n1981). When the First Orthographic Conference of 1876 made its recommenda-\ntions for the standardization and simplification of German orthography (see\nVerhandlungen 1876), these were thwarted, not least by Bismarck himself, on the\ngrounds that the population was already having to cope with changes in so many\nother areas of life in the wake of unification (Sauer 1988:87). When an agreement\nwas finally reached following the Second Orthographic Conference of 1901, the\noutcome was less a comprehensive \u201creform\u201d and more an endorsement of Konrad\nDuden\u2019s 1880 Complete Orthographical Dictionary of the German Language,\nO N T H E O R I G I N O F L I N G U I S T I C N O R M S\nLanguage in Society 31:4 (2002) 553\nwhich was based on the guidelines for Prussian and Bavarian schools.4 Indeed, it\nwas the nature of this compromise that led Duden himself to claim that the 1901\nguidelines were only really an \u201cintermediary step\u201d (Zwischenziel ) on the path to\nfurther reform (see Russ 1994:165). That the achievement of such a reform would\ntake almost another century is indicative of a paradox that surrounds orthography\ngenerally: its commonly perceived insignificance, which meant that the ques-\ntion of reform was repeatedly marginalized in favor of more pressing political\nconcerns (see Jansen-Tang 1988), coupled with its huge symbolic significance,\nthe popular and media expression of which was evident in the many public con-\ntroversies that accompanied both early reform attempts in the late 19th century\nand the 100 or so proposals put forward throughout the 20th century (see K\u00fcppers\n1984, Ledig 1999, Zabel 1989, 1996, 1997a).\nIronically, it was the actions of Duden himself that, from the outset, threatened\nthe ongoing process of standardization \u2013 or restandardization \u2013 he so fervently\ndesired. For example, in the seventh edition of his dictionary (1902), Duden al-\nready failed to adhere to many of the guidelines specified in the 1901 agreement.5\nThis trend was consolidated when, following his death in 1911, the general Duden\ndictionary was merged with the separate printers\u2019 Duden of 1907 to produce the\nninth edition of a single Duden in 1915. By this time, many of the inconsistencies\nbetween the 1901 guidelines, the general Duden, and the printers\u2019 Duden had\nbeen ironed out, albeit frequently going against the 1901 proposals. In fact, as\nKohrt (1997:304) has noted, although the state was certainly responsible for an\ninitial fixing of a standard orthography, it was private enterprise that did much to\nincrease normativity, not least in areas where the state had itself preferred a\ndegree of liberalism. Kohrt shows, for example, how the Duden continued to play\na crucial role in the normification of areas either not covered by the 1901 guide-\nlines (such as hyphenation and punctuation) or referred to only in general terms\n(such as noun capitalization), or by simply eliminating optional variability (as in\nthe spelling of foreign loans). Kohrt therefore concludes that, by the late 20th\ncentury, it was not so much the 1901 rules that were in need of reform but the\nvarious modifications of those rules undertaken since that time (for further ex-\namples, see Sauer 1988:103\u201316).\nAfter World War II and the division of Germany in 1949, it was especially\nclear that the success of any proposal for orthographic reform would depend on\nthe agreement of all the German-speaking countries, although the first serious\ninternational reform attempt, resulting in the Stuttgart Recommendations of 1954\n(see Strunk 1992, 1998) failed amid widespread public and media protest (see\nK\u00fcppers 1984:121\u201329). Moreover, by the end of that year, two separate versions\nof the Duden dictionary were now being published, one in East Germany (Leipzig)\nand one in the West (Mannheim). But it was the appearance in 1954 of a rival\ndictionary, published by Bertelsmann in West Germany, that was to trigger a\nlandmark decision in the history of German orthography (see Augst & Strunk\n1988). In 1955, the West German Duden editors turned to the Standing Confer-\nS A L LY J O H N S O N\n554 Language in Society 31:4 (2002)\nence of Ministers for Education and Cultural Affairs (Kultusministerkonferenz or\nKMK), asking for clarification of the situation vis-\u00e0-vis the norms of 1901. The\nKMK formally ruled that until revised norms were available, the 1901 guidelines\nwould remain valid, but in \u201ccases of uncertainty\u201d (Zweifelsf\u00e4lle), the supplemen-\ntary rules contained in the Duden should be considered binding. In this way,\nDuden \u2013 a private company \u2013 secured an unprecedented commercial monopoly in\nthe German dictionary market, thereby achieving its de facto status as the arbiter\nof German orthography for the next four decades (see Augst & Strunk 1988).\nFollowing the failure of the so-called Wiesbaden Recommendations of 1958\n(see Strunk 1992, 1998), discussions on orthographic reform continued through-\nout the 1960s and 1970s, not least in the context of the West German anti-\nauthoritarian student movement with its impassioned critique of the use of\northography as a means of disciplining schoolchildren (see Jansen-Tang 1988:106\u2013\n21). In an education system where the teaching of German continues to make\nextensive use of dictation (at least at the primary school level), and where all\npupils are required to \u201cresit\u201d whole school years should they fail their end-of-year\nexaminations, spelling reform coupled with a critique of dictation per se became\nkey components of attempts to eliminate discrimination against working-class\nchildren, who were thought to have less contact with written German than their\nmiddle-class counterparts.6 But it was not until the late 1970s, in the light of the\nvarious proposals drawn up in East and West Germany, Austria, and Switzerland,\nthat there appeared to be sufficient common ground for an international agree-\nment on reform (see Hillinger & Nerius 1997, Bl\u00fcml 1997, Looser & Sitta 1997,\nZabel 1997b). This led, in 1980, to the formation of the International Working\nParty on Orthography (Internationaler Arbeitskreis f\u00fcr Orthographie) (see Zabel\n1997c). Along with a series of interim meetings, three formal conferences of the\nWorking Party were held in Vienna in 1986, 1990, and 1994, known as the \u201cFirst,\nSecond and Third Vienna Talks\u201d (erste, zweite und dritte Wiener Gespr\u00e4che), but\noften collectively referred to as the Third Orthographic Conference (after 1876\nand 1901).\nAlthough the various proposals put forward by the Working Party were con-\ntinually revised in the light of popular and media protest (see Zabel 1989, 1996),\nby 1995 it looked as though a workable set of guidelines was finally available. In\nNovember, the Standing Conference of Ministers for Education and Cultural Af-\nfairs of the 16 Federal German States put out a press release announcing that the\nGerman-speaking countries had reached agreement on what was formally known\nas a \u201crevision of the guidelines governing German orthography\u201d (Neuregelung\nder deutschen Rechtschreibung) (Kultusministerkonferenz 1995). The aim of those\nrevisions, it claimed, was to reduce the overall number of rules for spelling and\npunctuation, and to eliminate some of the more general inconsistencies and errors\nthat had arisen over time. However, the press release did not mention two further,\nand ultimately crucial, points. First, the new guidelines were legally binding only\nfor those areas of public life over which the Ministers for Education and Cultural\nO N T H E O R I G I N O F L I N G U I S T I C N O R M S\nLanguage in Society 31:4 (2002) 555\nAffairs had jurisdiction: schools and state authorities (Beh\u00f6rden). Second, ap-\nproximating the procedure adopted in 1901 (see Augst & Strunk 1989), the re-\nvised orthography was to be introduced in Germany via decrees (Erlasse) issued\nby the Ministers for Education and CulturalAffairs of the individual federal states.\nIn other words, no statutory laws (Gesetze) were planned at the level of either the\nregional parliaments (L\u00e4nderparlamente or Landtage) or the national parliament\n(Bundestag).7\nThe actual revisions to German orthography are too complex to be described\nhere in detail, but they can be categorized into six main groups, as follows:\n(a) sound\u2013letter classifications (e.g. K\u00e4nguruhrK\u00e4nguru \u2018kangaroo\u2019);\n(b) compound spelling vs. separate words (e.g. radfahrenrRad fahren \u2018to\ncycle\u2019);\n(c) hyphenation (e.g. Hair-StylistrHairstylist\/Hair-Stylist);\n(d) capitalization (e.g. in bezug aufrin Bezug auf \u2018with respect to\u2019);\n(e) punctuation (a considerable reduction in the number of punctuation rules);\n(f ) the breaking of words at the ends of lines (e.g. Zuk-kerrZu-cker \u2018sugar\u2019).8\nAlthough it was generally estimated that the orthographic revisions required to\nan average text would amount to no more than approximately 0.5% (see Bundes-\nverfassungsgericht 1998:239), their quantitative minimality did little to assuage\npopular resistance. Indeed, for many opponents, the limited impact of the reform\nwas merely symptomatic of its general superfluity (see Ickler 1997), and by the\nsummer of 1996, public and particularly media expression of dissatisfaction was\nonce again widespread (see Ledig 1999, Zabel 1997a). Although there was prob-\nably very little that was new in the content of the arguments put forward during\nthis time (most, such as fears of a decline in the national cultural heritage, had\nbeen made repeatedly since the 19th century), the year 1996 did appear to mark\na significant fusion of various forms of protest, which would continue over the\nnext two years and in some cases beyond.\nT H E C O N S T I T U T I O N A L C H A L L E N G E O F 1 9 9 6\nI now turn to an analysis of the first legal challenge brought before the Federal\nConstitutional Court by Rolf Gr\u00f6schner and his daughter in May 1996, consisting\nin two requests for a temporary injunction to halt the ensuing introduction of the\nreform. As a basis for my analysis, I shall critically discuss the document con-\ntaining the official ruling of the Court on these two cases, 1 BvR 1057\/96 and 1\nBvR 1067\/96, which was published on 21 June 1996 (Bundesverfassungsgericht\n1996). It is important to note, however, that in the years leading up to his petition,\nthe central complainant, Gr\u00f6schner, acted as the supervisor of a doctoral disser-\ntation on constitutional aspects of orthographic reform by Wolfgang Kopke (Ko-\npke 1995a). Many of the ideas underpinning Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s case draw directly upon\nthis thesis, the thrust of which is summarized in various papers (e.g. Gr\u00f6schner\nS A L LY J O H N S O N\n556 Language in Society 31:4 (2002)\n1997, Gr\u00f6schner & Kopke 1997, Kopke 1995b, 1996, 1997), and which has been\nwidely and critically discussed elsewhere (e.g., Hufeld 1996, Hufen 1997, J\u00e4kel\n1996, Knobloch 1998, Kolonovits 1997, Kranz 1998, Meder 1997, Menzel 1998,\nMunske 1997, Rivers & Young 2001, Roellecke 1997, Roth 1999, Zabel 1996). I\nwill therefore expand on my discussion of the ruling in question with reference to\nthe relevant secondary literature.\nThe complaints\nIn the first section of his complaint (1.2.aa),9 Gr\u00f6schner disputed the role being\nplayed by the Duden dictionary in trying to secure the implementation of the\n1996 reform. The Duden, as we saw earlier, was declared in 1955 by the West\nGerman KMK to be binding in so-called cases of uncertainty until such time as a\nreform of the 1901 guidelines had been agreed. Meanwhile, the KMK resolution\nof 30 November 1995 had explicitly stated that the 1955 ruling would not be\nrevoked until 1 August 1998 (I.1c.9). Since, however, the individual Federal\nstates would be permitted to introduce the new guidelines at a time of their own\nchoosing in the two-year period between 1 August 1996 and 1 August 1998, and\nan edition of the Duden dictionary revised according to the new regulations was\nalready planned for the summer of 1996, it was Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s contention that the\nDuden would effectively function as a \u201clever\u201d for the reform\u2019s implementation\nduring this two-year transitionary period.\nKopke (1995a:48\u2013 65, 1995b:878\u201380) has argued at length that the original\n1955 ruling of the KMK almost certainly infringed the West German constitution\n(or Basic Law), which was adopted by the newly unified German state in 1990.\nFor example, Article 12 of the Basic Law states that \u201cThe practice of trades and\nprofessions may be regulated by law\u201d \u2013 that is to say, only by law (see Grundgesetz\n1998). By the early 1990s, however, anxious about the ensuing loss of their 40-\nyear monopoly, the Duden editors were especially eager to be seen publicly to\nhave played a central role in the new reform, thereby continuing to convey the\nimpression of the authoritative status of their dictionaries. For example, in a pam-\nphlet outlining the new guidelines (Duden 1994), Duden declared their self-\nappointed task of helping to secure the implementation of the reform; their editor-\nin-chief, G\u00fcnter Drosdowski, was happy to concede, in an interview in the news\nmagazine Der Spiegel (19 June 1995), the role of his company as the \u201clong arm\nof the state\u201d in matters of orthography. All in all, Kopke was of the opinion that\nthe position of the Duden publishers vis-\u00e0-vis the state was itself in need of stat-\nutory regulation \u2013 particularly because the 1996 reform was, in his view, tanta-\nmount to a recommendation to the population by the state to purchase an\nupdated version of the Duden, in itself a potential further breach of Article 12.\nOnly through the full and open public discussion that would necessarily accom-\npany the drawing up of proper statutory legislation on the question of ortho-\ngraphic reform would other publishers, Kopke believed, be afforded their rightful\nopportunity to compete openly with the Duden.10\nO N T H E O R I G I N O F L I N G U I S T I C N O R M S\nLanguage in Society 31:4 (2002) 557\nThe additional three complaints put forward by Gr\u00f6schner (I.2.bb) concerned\nvarious claims that the 1996 reform of German orthography constituted an in-\nfringement of his own constitutional rights as laid down in the Basic Law.\nGr\u00f6schner maintained, first of all, that the reform, and the purportedly unlaw-\nful role played by the Duden in securing its implementation, were an infringe-\nment of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Basic Law, which stipulates that \u201ceveryone\nhas the right to the free development of his personality insofar as he does not\nviolate the rights of others or offend against the constitutional order or the moral\ncode.\u201d In addition, Gr\u00f6schner cited Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Basic Law,\nwhich states, \u201cThe dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the\nduty of all state authority.\u201d It was Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s contention that the spelling reform\nbreached these rights because one of the basic conditions for the free develop-\nment of his personality was what he referred to as \u201clinguistic integrity.\u201d The\nspelling reform, he argued, impinged on that integrity because he would eventu-\nally be required \u2013 not only in his professional capacity as a civil servant, but even\nhis private correspondence \u2013 to adopt the new orthographic rules in order to avoid\nthe \u201csocial embarrassment\u201d that generally accompanies an inability to spell cor-\nrectly.11 He therefore claimed that it was the duty of the state, as enshrined in\nArticle 1, to protect the dignity associated with such linguistic integrity.\nKopke (1995a:277\u201393, 1996:1082) further develops this notion of \u201clinguistic\nintegrity\u201d by arguing that, although Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Basic Law spe-\ncifically guarantees the physical inviolability of the individual, Article 2, Para-\ngraph 1, taken together with Article 1, could also be interpreted as guaranteeing\npsychological inviolability. Given the intrinsic relationship between language\nand thought, an important component of such psychological inviolability would\nthen be linguistic integrity. Kopke (1996:1083) justifies this view as follows:\nArticle 5 of the constitution guarantees all citizens the right to freedom of ex-\npression in speech and writing. Although this has traditionally been interpreted in\nterms of content, Kopke argues that such freedom could also be extended to the\nform of expression \u2013 in this case, orthographic form. To justify this view, he\ndraws on recent research on written language and orthography that demonstrates\nthat writing is not merely, as traditionally maintained, a second-order represen-\ntation of spoken language (underpinning the dictum \u201cwrite as you speak\u201d). This\nis so because readers do not make sense of the written word by simply decoding\ngraphemes as direct representations of individual speech sounds, but, in addi-\ntion, by coming over time to recognize the meaning of lexical items as complete\nsemiotic units. Consequently, if writing can be demonstrated to constitute a sys-\ntem in its own right, then to demand that civil servants and pupils, like Gr\u00f6schner\nand his daughter, be obliged to change the system they have previously acquired\u2013\nand crucially stored in their \u201cmental lexicon\u201d \u2013 amounts to a constitutional breach\nof their right to the free development of their personality.\nSecondly, Gr\u00f6schner argued that the spelling reform impinged on his consti-\ntutional rights as laid down in Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Basic Law, which\nS A L LY J O H N S O N\n558 Language in Society 31:4 (2002)\nguarantees that \u201cArt and science, research and teaching are free.\u201d Gr\u00f6schner con-\nsidered that this freedom would be curtailed should he not be permitted, in his\ncapacity as an examiner in state law examinations, to evaluate the new spellings\nas incorrect.\nThird, Gr\u00f6schner maintained that the reform contravened his constitutional\nrights as specified in Article 6, Paragraph 2 of the Basic Law, which states that the\n\u201cCare and upbringing of children are the natural right of the parents and a duty\nprimarily incumbent on them.\u201d Gr\u00f6schner went on to argue how, while decrees\non the part of the KMK frequently constituted an adequate means by which to\nintroduce revisions to school curricula, the current reform was different. Because\nhis daughter would be learning an orthography fundamentally different from the\none he had learned, the reform impinged on his parental right to educate his\ndaughter as he wished. He therefore argued that such a conflict of parental au-\nthority need not be tolerated without an appropriate parliamentary ruling, that is,\na statutory law as opposed to a ministerial decree. This was reinforced by his\n14-year-old daughter, who added that she too considered the spelling reform to be\nan infringement of the right to free development of her own personality, since she\nwould be forced to use spellings other than those she had previously learned at\nhome and school, and had therefore stored in her \u201cmental lexicon.\u201d\nThe need perceived by Gr\u00f6schner and his daughter for a statutory regulation of\northography is linked to the complex historical question of the relative powers\nof the legislature and the executive with respect to the German constitutional mon-\narchy of 1901, on the one hand, and the postwar parliamentary democracy of (West)\nGermany, on the other. Augst & Strunk 1989 had proposed that the 1901 mode of\nimplementing an orthographic reform via ministerial decree afforded an appro-\npriate precedent for 1996, but this was severely disputed by Gr\u00f6schner and Kopke\n(Gr\u00f6schner 1997, Gr\u00f6schner & Kopke 1997, Kopke 1995a, 1995b). Thus, while\ncontrol over educational matters in both periods remained primarily in the hands\nof the executive (the L\u00e4nder), Kopke argued that this by no means guaranteed the\nequivalence of executive powers in the two historical periods. In fact, he pro-\nposed that, under the constitutional monarchy of 1901, the powers of the execu-\ntive were significantly greater than in the new republic, for two main reasons. First,\nArticle 7 of the Basic Law now states: \u201cThe entire education system is under the\nsupervision of the state\u201d (although the definition of both \u201csupervision\u201d and \u201cstate\u201d\nremains open to interpretation). Second, the rights of the individual vis-\u00e0-vis the\nstate are much more firmly embedded in the current Basic Law than in the 1901\nconstitution. This means that German citizens are now in a position to demand ac-\ntion on the part of the legislature \u2013 in other words, the statutory enforcement of ex-\necutive action \u2013 wherever they consider their basic rights to be affected. It is a point\nof additional interest that, unlike in 1901, when the rights of civil servants and\nschool pupils such as Gr\u00f6schner and his daughter were afforded no protection, this\nhas not been the case since 1949, when the rights of both groups have been con-\nstitutionally guaranteed (see Kopke 1995a:163, 215).\nO N T H E O R I G I N O F L I N G U I S T I C N O R M S\nLanguage in Society 31:4 (2002) 559\nHowever, this postwar German model of a federal constitutional democracy\nbrings with it a crucial dilemma, no doubt familiar to students of the US consti-\ntution, which itself afforded the inspiration for the German Basic Law. One of the\nmain aims of the Basic Law was to rectify the flaws in the Weimar constitution\nthat had structurally facilitated the seizure of power by the National Socialists in\n1933 (see D\u00fcrig 1998:ix\u2013xvi). This was to be achieved particularly via Article\n20, with its proposition that \u201cAll state authority emanates from the people,\u201d and\nits guarantee of a separation of legislative, executive, and judicial organs. The\nproblem here is that structures originally intended as a means of strengthening\nthe democratic influence of the people against the potentially totalizing forces of\nthe state simultaneously run the risk of an ever-increasing juridification of social\nlife, which eventually threatens to stifle political action on the part of the state.\nThis occurs as citizens repeatedly contest the authority of the executive (in this\ncase, the KMK) by means of recourse to the judiciary (in this case, the Federal\nConstitutional Court) in order to demand action on the part of the legislature (in\nthis case, either the national or L\u00e4nder parliaments). It is precisely in an attempt\nto avoid such \u201cover-juridification\u201d that there is, in practice, frequent recourse to\nthe \u201cprinciple of fundamentality\u201d (Wesentlichskeitsprinzip or -doktrin). This pos-\nits that rulings by the legislature, in the form of parliamentary statutes, are re-\nquired only in those cases where the decisions to be made are too fundamental\nto be left to the executive (Gr\u00f6schner 1997). The crux of all such disputes then\nlies in the specification of what is fundamental.\nIn a series of constitutional debates over educational issues since 1949, the\nprinciple of fundamentality has generally been interpreted thus: The KMK may\nstipulate changes to the content of school curricula by means of decree, provided\nthat such changes are fairly limited and gradual, affecting only minor curricular\ndetails (so-called Feinlernziele). Where broader, more fundamental pedagogic\naims and objectives (Groblernziele) are affected, action is required on the part of\nthe legislature. Since the 1970s, a benchmark in this regard has been the extent to\nwhich curricular innovations were thought to have an impact extending beyond\nthe limited realm of school pupils, thereby potentially impinging on the consti-\ntutional rights of citizens in the wider community. This was the case, for example,\nin 1977, when changes to the sex education curriculum proposed in Hamburg\nwere deemed sufficiently to affect the constitutional rights of individuals in the\nwider community so as to require a statutory ruling on behalf of the regional\nparliament there (see Kopke 1995a:157\u2013 62).\nIt was Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s belief that the 1996 reform of German orthography af-\nfected broader pedagogic aims and objectives in two main ways (Gr\u00f6schner 1997).\nFirst, he argued that the reform resulted in an orthography with content funda-\nmentally different from that of the previous one. In his view, the 1901 agreement\nhad not really constituted a reform at all but had simply documented an \u201corganic\u201d\nprocess of language change, whereas the 1996 reform had introduced a number of\npreviously nonexistent spellings.12 This, he then argued, meant that pupils would\nS A L LY J O H N S O N\n560 Language in Society 31:4 (2002)\nbe required to learn a version of German orthography that was fundamentally\ndifferent from the previous one. The second reason concerns the much-disputed\nquestion of the relationship between school curricula and their implications for\nthe wider community. Here again, Gr\u00f6schner held the conviction that the 1996\nreform would have implications extending beyond schools, thereby affecting the\nconstitutional rights of the wider population. Not only did Article III of the Vi-\nenna Declaration clearly state that the long-term aim of the reform would be to\nwork toward the preservation of orthographic unity in the whole German-speaking\narea; further evidence was provided by the role of the Duden Corporation in\nsecuring the implementation of the reform right across the speech community. All\nthis underpinned Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s belief in the need for a statutory ruling on ortho-\ngraphic reform at either national or L\u00e4nder level.13\nThe Court\u2019s response\nSection II of the ruling outlines the response of the Constitutional Court, which is\nobliged formally to accept constitutional complaints by individuals in conjunc-\ntion with two sections of the Law of the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundes-\nverfassungsgerichtsgesetz or BVerfGG). The first of these, \u00a793a Paragraph 2,\nstates that complaints can be accepted only where fundamental significance in\nterms of constitutional rights can be attached to the disputed measures\u2013 and the\nCourt rejected that such significance was forthcoming in Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s case. Given\ntheir inadmissibility, the complaints therefore could not be considered in relation\nto \u00a790, Paragraph 1, which states that every individual has the right to make a\nconstitutional complaint to the Constitutional Court should he or she believe that\nthe actions of state authorities have impinged on constitutional rights. The Court\njustified its refusal to accept Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s complaint as follows: For an individual\nto be fundamentally affected by a breach of one or more constitutional rights,\nhe or she must be \u201cpersonally, currently and directly\u201d affected (II.1). The Court\nruled that this was not the case where Gr\u00f6schner was concerned and dealt with the\ncomplaints in reverse order.\nThe first reason for the rejection of Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s claim that he was directly\naffected by the spelling reform referred to the question of parental rights. The\nCourt ruled that the spelling reform was, at the time of the complaint (May 1996),\nlimited to a mutual obligation entered into by the Ministers for Education and\nCultural Affairs of the 16 L\u00e4nder, who would subsequently be responsible for its\nactual implementation in schools. However, since at the time of Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s\ncomplaint that implementation had not yet begun, Gr\u00f6schner could not yet claim\nto be directly affected (II.1.a.aa) \u2013 indeed, nobody could. In other words, the\ncomplaint was dismissed because it was prematurely lodged. This legal techni-\ncality, not surprisingly, infuriated opponents of the reform, who argued that, by\nthe time the reform had in fact been introduced, they would be dealing with a fait\naccompli, which (as they rightly anticipated) would be even harder to reverse\n(see Ickler 1997:136\u201337).14\nO N T H E O R I G I N O F L I N G U I S T I C N O R M S\nLanguage in Society 31:4 (2002) 561\nThe second reason why the complaint was rejected reflects the requirement \u2013\nstipulated in \u00a790, Paragraph 2, Sentence 1 of the Law of the Federal Constitu-\ntional Court \u2013 that, prior to lodging a complaint, complainants must first have\ntaken their case to the lower courts and exhausted the requisite legal channels.\nHowever, the same paragraph goes on to state that complainants may proceed\ndirectly to the Constitutional Court should they consider themselves to be se-\nverely and unavoidably disadvantaged by first proceeding through the lower courts.\nIn this case, the Court did not believe that such a disadvantage was forthcoming\nand ruled that Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s complaint was therefore inadmissible.\nAfter stating that the actions of the Standing Conference of Ministers for Ed-\nucation and Cultural Affairs could not be considered to constitute a breach of\nparental rights, the Court proceeded to rule that the actions of neither the Stand-\ning Conference of the Prime Ministers of the 16 L\u00e4nder (Ministerpr\u00e4sidenten-\nkonferenz or MPK) nor the Federal government could, for the same reasons, be\nconsidered to affect the complainant directly (II.1.bb). Nor would Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s\nrights be directly impinged on by the signing of the declaration of intent planned\nfor 1 July 1996 in Vienna (II.1.cc): This declaration, the Court claimed, would\nneither function as a legally binding agreement for the Federal Republic, nor\nwould it directly affect the implementation of the reform. However, as Kopke\n(1997:112\u201313) later argued, this merely highlighted the practical unenforceabil-\nity of the reform, since no legal action could be taken against any country or\nFederal state that subsequently failed to secure its implementation.\nFinally in this section, the Court dealt with the disputed role played by the\nDuden dictionary vis-\u00e0-vis the 1996 reform (II.1.dd). The Court thereby reiter-\nated the KMK ruling of 1955 that the 1901 rules remained valid until a further\nreform had been implemented, and that only in so-called cases of uncertainty\nshould reference be made to the supplementary rules contained in the Duden. The\nCourt ruled that, in those L\u00e4nder where the reform had not yet been introduced,\nany version of the Duden that did not conform to the 1901 guidelines (i.e., one\nrevised according to the new rules) was not covered by the ruling of 1955 and\ntherefore disqualified itself from use in the classroom. This meant that, in the\ntwo-year period between 1 August 1996 and 1 August 1998, teachers in the \u201cpre-\nreform\u201d L\u00e4nder would be required to refer to pre-1996 versions of the Duden in\n\u201ccases of uncertainty.\u201d In reality, this was what happened, because such \u201cpre-\nreform\u201d L\u00e4nder would not have acquired new, updated dictionaries until the re-\nform had actually been introduced; this undermined Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s argument that\nteachers would be obliged to distinguish between the pre- and post-1996 editions\nof the Duden during the interim period (see also Menzel 1998:1181).\nHaving dismissed Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s assertion that the reform required a statutory\nruling to secure its implementation (and having rejected his daughter\u2019s case on\nthe same grounds, see II.2), the Court proceeded to address the two remaining\naspects of Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s complaint. First, the Court rejected outright Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s\nclaim that his freedom of teaching would be curtailed, since it did not accept that\nS A L LY J O H N S O N\n562 Language in Society 31:4 (2002)\nhe was either directly affected by the reform or that his duties with regard to state\nexaminations were embraced by this aspect of the Basic Law (II.1.b). Second, the\nCourt dismissed Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s complaint that the reform constitute a breach of his\nconstitutional right to the free development of his personality (II.1.c), refusing to\naccept his suggestion that he would be forced to adopt the new orthography in\norder to avoid social embarrassment in the eyes of the speech community. This,\naccording to the Court, was so because the speech community does not base its\nviews regarding the correctness of particular spellings specifically on rulings\nmade by the state. Instead, perceptions of orthographical correctness depend on\nthose rules that the community itself considers to be binding. The Court there-\nfore proposed that those members of the speech community who had already\nlearned to read and write would not conclude that Gr\u00f6schner was writing incor-\nrectly should he continue to use the old spellings; they would merely assume that\nhe was adhering to the traditional, as opposed to the revised, rules.\nFrom Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s perspective, the ruling of the Court arguably missed the\npoint because, as becomes clear elsewhere, underpinning his complaint is pre-\ncisely the fear that the speech community would conclude that he was adhering to\nthe traditional, pre-reform spellings. Gr\u00f6schner then argued that, through con-\ntinuing to use the old orthography, he would in fact be \u201couting\u201d himself as \u201ccon-\nservative\u201d (Gr\u00f6schner & Kopke 1997:299).15 However, of particular theoretical\ninterest in this regard is the distinction made by the Court between de jure rulings\non orthographical correctness (i.e., by the state) and de facto perceptions of cor-\nrectness (within the speech community), whereby precedence is given to the lat-\nter. In doing so, the Court would appear to have sidestepped the all-important\nsociolinguistic question of the relationship between these two spheres and their\nrelative significance for the individual language user, a point to which I will\nreturn in the next section.\nWith regard to Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s alleged breach of his personality rights, the Court\nruled once again that, because the reform had not yet been introduced into schools,\nthere was no actual basis for a constitutional complaint at that point in time. But\nthe Court went on to add that, even though the writing practices of the wider\ncommunity were unlikely to remain unaffected in the longer term by the partic-\nular version of orthography taught in schools at any one time, the constitution\nwould never ultimately be in a position to offer the complainant protection\nfrom confrontation with such spellings. In this regard, the comments of the Court\nhighlight an intriguing paradox. By stating that the Basic Law could not protect\nthe complainant from new spellings taught in schools, the Court would appear to\nbe admitting that reforms are in fact potentially fundamental, in the constitu-\ntional sense maintained by Gr\u00f6schner. Clearly, the effects of a reform cannot be\nlimited to school-aged children and official authorities (over which the KMK has\njurisdiction); they are always intended to percolate through the speech commu-\nnity (over which it has none) \u2013 an intention clearly stated by the Vienna Decla-\nration. But leaving aside the obvious question as to what the purpose of a school\nO N T H E O R I G I N O F L I N G U I S T I C N O R M S\nLanguage in Society 31:4 (2002) 563\neducation is meant to be, if not to prepare pupils for later life as part of the wider\ncommunity (and what are pupils, in any case, if not already a part of that com-\nmunity?), it is precisely this aspect of the constitutional dispute surrounding the\n1996 reform of German orthography that takes us to the heart of the ideological\nrelationship between the individual, the speech community, and the nation-state.\nD I S C U S S I O N\nOrthography, ideology and the nation-state\nAs a branch of language planning, language standardization is closely connected\nwith the rise of nation-states and the concomitant project of modernity (Joseph\n1987, Milroy & Milroy 1999, Kroskrity 2000). Williams (1992:128) describes\nhow, as part of that project, language itself becomes tied into the evolutionary\nview of progress central to modernist thinking. Accordingly, languages and0or\nspecific varieties of language are objectified and dichotomized into \u201cmodern\u201d\nversus \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201cdeveloped\u201d versus \u201cless developed,\u201d and, Williams\nwrites, \u201cThe most important of the diacritica of such a typology are literacy and\nwriting\u201d (1992:128).\nThe German language was no exception in this regard. Indeed, Durrell\n(1999:292\u201393, 302\u20133) has noted that the history of standard German is proba-\nbly best characterized as the standardization of the written language, or\nSchriftdeutsch, whereas the standardization of English drew historically on both\nwritten and spoken usage. Underpinning the comparatively greater emphasis\non written German were a number of factors, including the lack of an obvious\nsingle metropolis or region that might have afforded a spoken model for a\nnational standard, as London or the Home Counties did for English. These\nfactors, in turn, relate to the fractured political histories of the German regions,\nand they partly account for why language was to take on such an important\nsymbolic function in the \u201cimagining\u201d of the German Kulturnation \u2013 a nation\nbased on a common cultural heritage as opposed to a shared political history\n(see Coulmas 1995:57). They also offer some explanation as to why, following\nthe relatively late political unification of Germany in 1871, state authorities\nwould play a more proactive role than their British counterparts in the stan-\ndardization of the national language, particularly its written variety (see Dur-\nrell 1999:291).\nFor Williams (1992:20\u201335), standardization was and is an ideological project,\naccording to which language is frequently invoked by the state as an instrument\nfor the socialization of its subjects (see also Blommaert 1996). As a symbol of\nboth unity and division, language thereby acquires a crucial gatekeeping function\nthrough which membership in the nation-state is not only afforded but also de-\nnied. At an inter-national level, this operates via the specification of those in-\ndividuals and groups who do or do not have a native command of the national\nlanguage, a specification grounded in the Herderian conflation of language, cul-\nS A L LY J O H N S O N\n564 Language in Society 31:4 (2002)\nture, and nation, which Blommaert & Verschueren (1998:117\u2013 47) refer to as\n\u201chomogeneism.\u201d At an intra-national level, by contrast, such linguistic gate-\nkeeping works via the setting of a national standard. Here, the specification of\nwhat is \u201cmodern\u201d becomes tantamount to a prescription of what is \u201ccorrect.\u201d\nBecause the selection of the standard variety is itself ideologically motivated (it\nis no coincidence that the 1901 guidelines on orthography were based on usage in\nthe two largest and most powerful regions of Germany at the time, Prussia and\nBavaria), language emerges as a useful means with which to shore up the interests\nof already powerful social, economic, and regional groups, thereby legitimizing\ninequality. As Williams (1992:25) points out, a central role in the naturalization\nof this disciplinary discourse of language is accorded to education, where the\ninculcation of the values associated not just with the usage but especially with\ncorrect usage of the national language becomes \u201ca pedagogical exercise\u201d (see\nalso Milroy 2001).\nHowever, the pursuit of modernism and the concomitant standardization of\nany area of social life raise a fundamental philosophical dilemma with regard\nto the authority of the state over its subjects. Central to this dilemma, accord-\ning to Williams (1992:9), is the distinction between what T\u00f6nnies referred to as\nGemeinschaft \u2018community\u2019, on the one hand, and Gesellschaft \u2018society\u2019, on the\nother. T\u00f6nnies 1887 argued that, following the Renaissance, processes of ur-\nbanization and industrialization had meant that the Gemeinschaft, with its pri-\nmordial ties of friendship and kinship within a \u201ccommunity of fate,\u201d had\ngradually been forced to give way to the Gesellschaft, with its complex regu-\nlatory frameworks superimposed by the state. There are many objections to\nthis view. Dahrendorf (1968:146\u2013 47), for example, not only describes the\ncommunity0society dichotomy as \u201chistorically misleading, sociologically un-\ninformed and politically illiberal\u201d (my translation); he also doubts the very\nexistence of the idealized version of \u201ccommunity\u201d posited by T\u00f6nnies, which\nromanticizes the premodern era together with the purportedly \u201corganic\u201d origins\nof its regulatory social practices.16 As Williams (1992:10\u201311) notes, however,\nsuch objections do not render the ideological purchase of the Gemeinschaft\/\nGesellschaft distinction less valuable for the emergent nation-state. This is be-\ncause \u201cthe superimposition of time upon society in such a way that social change\nproceeds in a unilinear direction with a degree of inevitability means that Ge-\nmeinschaft must give way to Gesellschaft, thereby implementing and justify-\ning the state in society\u201d (1992:10, emphasis added). In other words, it is the\nvery inevitability of the supposed transition from community to society that is\ninvoked by the state in order to legitimize its intervention into hitherto unreg-\nulated areas of social life.\nAt this point, the interests of the state would appear to be in direct conflict with\nthose of the community. Although this arguably underlines the state\u2019s need to\ndivert the individual away from a dependency on community ties, the dilemma\nthen becomes one of how to conserve the moral imperative \u2013 a sense of right and\nO N T H E O R I G I N O F L I N G U I S T I C N O R M S\nLanguage in Society 31:4 (2002) 565\nwrong \u2013 as forms of social organization become increasingly complex. The prob-\nlem is especially vexing given that the nation-state is itself the creation of indi-\nvidualism, which necessarily puts a premium on the rights and freedom of the\nindividual. As Williams notes: \u201cIn this sense it is not the state and the community\nwhich are in opposition but the state and the individual\u201d (1992:11). The \u201csolu-\ntion,\u201d it seems, lies once again in an invocation by the state of the concept of\nGemeinschaft, this time with its idealized solidarity as a source from which in-\ndividuals derive their moral imperative. As Williams (1992:11) concludes, the\nobjective of the state then becomes that of teaching its subjects to \u201c\u2018respect the\nsacred bond\u2019 of community,\u201d for it is precisely in order to consolidate its own\ninterests that the state must compel the individual to act as a member of the\ncommunity.\nOn the origin of linguistic norms\nThe legal dispute over the 1996 reform of German orthography provides a fas-\ncinating illustration of the ideological process outlined above. Here, the various\nbrokers \u2013 Gr\u00f6schner and his daughter, on the one hand, and the judges of the\nFederal Constitutional Court, on the other \u2013 are engaged in an ideological debate\nover who has the right to control the German language. In their respective pursuit\nof \u201cauthoritative entextualization,\u201d many questions arise about the nature, func-\ntion, and origin of orthographic norms. Do such norms originate \u201corganically\u201d as\na result of a moral imperative from within the speech community, or SPRACHge-\nmeinschaft? Is it legitimate, not to mention desirable, for the state to intervene\nactively in the prescription of such norms? What are the implications for\u2013 and\nrights of \u2013 the individual language user within this complex?\nThe roots of this particular debate lie, as we saw earlier, in the historical de-\nvelopment of the German language and the decision by the newly founded nation-\nstate to engage in the formal prescription of orthographic norms at the beginning\nof the 20th century. Having laid down a set of standardized guidelines, the Ger-\nman state was then confronted with the classic modernist dilemma of how to\nreconcile the static quality of a fixed standard with the dynamics of social and\nlinguistic change. Not only had the 1901 rules crystallized an inevitably imper-\nfect snapshot of a standard orthography, itself subject to much dispute at the time;\nin addition, orthographic conventions would continue to evolve throughout the\n20th century, gradually increasing the state\u2019s need for re-modernization, a pro-\ncess for which, crucially, no provision had been made in 1901. The problem was\nparticularly acute if the efficacy of orthography was to be maintained as a means\nof inculcating the value of standard language more generally, especially via ed-\nucation. By the end of the 20th century, a range of discrepancies had arisen be-\ntween the official 1901 guidelines and what was perceived to be \u201ccurrent usage\u201d \u2013\ndisseminated not least via the combined Duden of 1915 and subsequent editions\nof the dictionary\u2013 and as a result, many schoolteachers were finding the teaching\nand evaluation of orthography increasingly frustrating and time-consuming, par-\nS A L LY J O H N S O N\n566 Language in Society 31:4 (2002)\nticularly in the early years of schooling, when dictation exercises are still com-\nmon. If this disciplinary function of orthography was to be sustained, something\nonce again had to be done, although the need for restandardization was at no time\nframed in such explicitly political terms.\nAgainst this backdrop, it starts to become clear how reaching agreement on the\nlinguistic aspects of the reform would not be the only problem with which the\nstate would have to contend (see Augst et al. 1997). Once a new set of guidelines\nhad been finalized by 1995, it would be their political implementation that\nwould then be a major headache for the reformers (Scheuringer 1997). Although\nthe implementation of the 1901 regulations was itself much disputed at the time,\nit was clearly not just language that had evolved in the intervening century. Fol-\nlowing World War II, the revised constitutional arrangement of the West German\nstate\u2013 and from 1990, that of the newly unified Germany \u2013 meant that the rights\nof the individual citizen were now much more firmly anchored in the constitu-\ntion. This, together with a range of political developments such as the student\nprotest movement of the 1960s and 1970s and the rise of \u201ccitizens\u2019action groups\u201d\n(B\u00fcrgerinitiativen) in the 1980s, meant that German citizens were not only more\nconstitutionally able but also perhaps more fundamentally willing to challenge\nthe authority of the state on a wide range of issues and from a broad spectrum of\npolitical standpoints (Beck 1992, 1995, 1997). Add to this the increased expres-\nsion of skepticism toward authority and expertise that is generally thought to\ncharacterize the period now referred to as \u201clate\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d modernity (Giddens\n1991), and it is clear that the German state was faced with a very different set of\nsocial and political circumstances in which to instigate a process of orthographic\nreform (see Antos 1996:238\u2013 49).\nCentral to the case put forward by Gr\u00f6schner and his daughter is the dignity of\nthe individual language user, itself highly dependent on the views of ortho-\ngraphical correctness held by others within the speech community. What is then\nbeing disputed by the complainants is the right of the state to take action that\nupsets the purported balance of consensus within that community, thereby im-\npinging on the dignity of the individual. There is, of course, some irony in this\nline of argument. Given their familiarity with the historical complexities sur-\nrounding the reform, Gr\u00f6schner and his daughter must have been aware that the\northographic norms that obtained within the speech community before 1996 were\nat least partly the product of state intervention in the form of regulations for\nschools since the mid-19th century, culminating in the guidelines of 1901, along\nwith the state sanctioning of the Duden in 1955. And familiar with the discussions\nin Kopke\u2019s thesis (1995a:294\u2013371), they will have understood that at the root of\nthe debate over orthographic reform is its use by schools as a means of disciplin-\ning pupils. However, it is interesting that at no point in the case presented to the\nConstitutional Court was this particular function of orthography under dispute.\nOn the contrary, a cornerstone of Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s argument was his claim that the\nreform would actually undermine his own personal authority over his daughter\nO N T H E O R I G I N O F L I N G U I S T I C N O R M S\nLanguage in Society 31:4 (2002) 567\nand the students whose examinations he marked. At a more abstract level, it is\npossible to characterize Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s views as very much in accordance with the\nmodel outlined by Williams above: As an individual, Gr\u00f6schner is convinced that\nhe takes his moral imperative not from the state but from within the speech com-\nmunity; yet in his role as a parent and university professor, he actively and will-\ningly participates in the dissemination within the speech community of what\nmight be seen as a state-sanctioned ideology of standard orthography via the\neducation of those in his charge.\nOf course, it was precisely in order to maintain the disciplinary function sur-\nrounding orthography that the state was now obliged to modernize the guidelines\nof 1901. But whereas processes of modernization typically serve to consolidate\nthe social, economic, and cultural capital of already powerful groups, this par-\nticular process was one in which Gr\u00f6schner and his daughter presumably feared\nthey stood to lose. Accepting the premise that spelling errors are commonly taken\nto be an indicator of low intelligence by the speech community, the two now\nconsidered themselves to be vulnerable should they adhere to the pre-reform\nspellings. It was a threat of social marginalization that they were willing to con-\ntest with all the constitutional force they could muster. But however radical the\nform of their protest might appear, there was little that was radical in its content:\nThis protest in no way challenged the more general ideological function under-\npinning the standardization of orthography. Theirs was a defense of tradition,\nalbeit a tradition that was itself once modern. It was, moreover, a defense that\ninvoked\u2013 and arguably romanticized \u2013 the organic solidarity of the speech com-\nmunity and pitted this against a more mechanical form of regulation imposed by\nthe state.\nWe saw earlier that wherever German citizens consider actions by third parties\nto have impinged on their rights as laid down in the Basic Law, it is their consti-\ntutionally guaranteed right to contest those actions, first via the lower and upper\nadministrative courts and then, if necessary, via the Constitutional Court. In such\ncases, it is the remit of the Constitutional Court to mediate between the various\nparties and, as D\u00fcrig (1998:xvi\u2013xvii) describes in his introduction to the Basic\nLaw, there are three important elements to that process. First, it is the fundamen-\ntal task of the Court to protect the constitutional order on which the state is\nfounded.17 Second, the protection of that constitutional order is to be achieved by\nallowing conflicts to surface rather than by repressing them. Third, the Court\naims to resolve such conflicts via a process of depoliticization.\nThe impossibility of depoliticizing what is an inherently political conflict is\nclear. Although the judges of the Court did not address the ideological functions\nof orthography that lie at the heart of the dispute, they nonetheless engaged in a\ncrucial piece of ideological brokerage on behalf of the state, much in line with the\nprocess characterized by Williams above. In order to justify the right of the state\nto prescribe orthographic norms by ministerial decree, the Court dismissed the\nsignificance of the reform for the wider speech community. Yet at the same time,\nS A L LY J O H N S O N\n568 Language in Society 31:4 (2002)\nthe success of state action \u2013 i.e., the reform \u2013 is self-evidently dependent on the\ncompliance of that community. The Court therefore tried to reassure Gr\u00f6schner\nthat the speech community would not think less highly of him for his continued\nuse of the traditional orthography, because the speech community allegedly bases\nits views of orthographic correctness not on the norms prescribed de jure by the\nstate, but on the norms acknowledged de facto by the speech community. In doing\nso, the Court \u2013 just like the complainants \u2013 invoked the idealized solidarity of the\nspeech community as the source of the individual\u2019s moral imperative. This, how-\never, is a potentially contradictory line of argumentation that merely lends cre-\ndence to the complainants\u2019original assertion that the 1996 reform of orthography\nmight indeed be of fundamental significance for the wider speech community in\nthe sense maintained by Gr\u00f6schner.\nC O N C L U S I O N\nFollowing the rejection of the complaints brought by Gr\u00f6schner and his daugh-\nter in 1996, many parents of school-aged children challenged the reform in the\nlower and upper administrative courts of various German L\u00e4nder. Altogether,\nabout 30 cases were heard, with just over half going in favor of the reform.18\nIn May 1998, the case was referred back to the Federal Constitutional Court\nfor a final hearing based on a set of complaints broadly similar to those of\nGr\u00f6schner and his daughter, this time put forward by Thomas Elsner and Gunda\nDiercks-Elsner, the parents of two children of primary-school age in the state\nof Schleswig-Holstein (see Bundesverfassungsgericht 14 July 1998). Having\nalready exhausted the requisite legal channels, and given that the reform had\nactually been introduced in Schleswig-Holstein and elsewhere, the complaints\nwere this time formally accepted for a hearing by the Constitutional Court.19\nOnce again, the complaints were rejected. The Court argued, inter alia, that it\ndid not accept that a reform affecting only 0.5% of the written language consti-\ntuted a fundamental intervention into the broader pedagogic aim of teaching pu-\npils to read and write, thereby impinging on the constitutional rights of either\npupils or their parents in any fundamental way. Although the Court conceded that\nthe reform was certainly of general relevance for the wider speech community,\nit noted that such relevance did not in itself render the reform unconstitutional;\ncomplainants must be able to show that the changes affected in a fundamental\nway the basic rights of individuals within that community and, again, no such\nimpact was apparent. The Court therefore upheld the right of the executive to\nimplement the reform and did not deem involvement of the legislature to be\nnecessary.\nAs Rivers & Young (2001:176\u201377) have proposed in a legal and linguistic\nassessment of the 1998 ruling, the decision of the Constitutional Court might well\nbe seen as a sensible and pragmatic attempt to avoid the further juridification of\northographic norms, combined with a healthy degree of agnosticism regarding\nO N T H E O R I G I N O F L I N G U I S T I C N O R M S\nLanguage in Society 31:4 (2002) 569\nthe vexed question of who exactly controls the German language. They note,\nnonetheless, the unsatisfactory nature of the ruling concerning the reform\u2019s im-\nplications for the wider speech community. Here, the Court reiterated that, out-\nside of schools and official authorities, people were free to continue writing as\nthey wished. Although this is technically true, once the Court admitted conse-\nquences of a sort for the wider community, tradition dictates that the Court\nshould then at least have addressed the constitutional issues thereby raised. But it\ndid not: It simply dismissed the implications of the reform for the speech com-\nmunity as an irrelevance (Rivers & Young 2001:177).\nI would argue that there is good reason for this. As I have shown throughout\nthis essay, even though the successful implementation of the reform in the long\nterm will clearly depend on the cooperation of the wider speech community, its\nsuccessful enforcement in the short term was equally dependent on the margin-\nalization of that role. This is so because, while schools and state authorities are\nunder the jurisdiction of the executive, the wider speech community is not. Al-\nthough it is crucial to emphasize that the Constitutional Court was in no way\nobliged to side with the state on this or any other matter, once it began seriously\nto explore the question of whether the constitutional rights of those outside of\nschools and state authorities were in any way affected, it would at some point\nhave been obliged to address the crucial question of the reform\u2019s overall purpose\nin respect to individual speakers within the wider speech community. However, it\nis difficult to see how this could have been achieved within the Court\u2019s own remit\nof depoliticizing conflict situations, and without ultimately exploring the politi-\ncal and ideological dimensions of the standardization process per se. In the final\nanalysis, the Court therefore bypassed one of the most important questions sur-\nrounding the reform by simply ignoring it. However, the fact that the judges were\nin a position to ignore such a crucial question was ultimately contingent on the\npower with which the Court is invested by the state. And therein, no doubt, lies\nthe ability of many an ideological broker to reproduce a dominant language ide-\nology and to secure \u201cauthoritative entextualization\u201d in a language ideological\ndebate.20\nN O T E S\n* I would like to express my gratitude to the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany,\nwhich provided me with a one-year research fellowship in 2000\u20132001. This time was spent at the\nInstitute for German Language in Mannheim, and I would like to thank colleagues there for their help\nwhile researching and writing this article. I would also like to thank Oliver Stenschke and Antje\nFischer at G\u00f6ttingen University, Chris Young at Cambridge, and the two anonymous readers for their\nperceptive comments on earlier drafts. Responsibility for the content remains, of course, my own.\n1 C.f. Schiffmann (1998:368), in the context of a discussion of the (re-)standardization of spoken\nTamil, argues: \u201cThese days it is fashionable, in many circles in the West, to deny both the existence\nand legitimacy of standard English or other standard languages \u2013 because standards have often been\nused capriciously and maliciously, to deny non-standard speakers access to power. Therefore, we now\nhear and see a great deal about hegemony, power imbalance, linguistic prejudice, maintenance0denial\nof privilege, empowerment, and many other allusions to ideological control of language.\u201d Although\nS A L LY J O H N S O N\n570 Language in Society 31:4 (2002)\nSchiffman is right to point out that standards may serve important functions in terms of securing the\ncommunicative effectiveness of a given language (e.g., in foreign-language pedagogy), he under-\nmines his own \u201canti-ideological\u201d line of argumentation when he points out: \u201cThe fact is that, when all\nis said and done, speakers of natural languages make judgments about different kinds of speech and\nwriting of which they hear and see samples, and some of those judgments are, like it or not, hierar-\nchical social judgments\u201d (1998:369). As I see it, the underlying premise of work on language ideol-\nogies and language ideological debates lies not in some kind of politically motivated disregard for\nsociolinguistic processes such as standardization (as implied by Schiffman), but in this work as a\nmeans of deepening our understanding of precisely such processes via a more holistic account of the\nrelationship between the relevant linguistic and social factors (see Milroy 2001 for a similar line of\nargument).\n2 See Fix (1994:25\u201374) for a critical discussion of the historical relationship between the stan-\ndardization of orthography, the implementation of planned curricula, and the increasing use of dic-\ntation as a means of teaching and evaluating literacy.\n3 Parallel to the state codification of orthographic norms was the specification of the spoken\nstandard (see Siebs 1898). For an interesting comparative discussion of the ensuing standardization of\nthe legal and orthographic traditions in the different regions before and after unification in the 19th\ncentury, see Meder 1997.\n4 Some changes were nonetheless agreed, among others (i) the abolition of ^h& in words of Ger-\nman origin such as Th\u00fcrrT\u00fcr \u2018door\u2019; (ii) the use of ^k& or ^z& to replace ^c& in foreign loans, e.g.\nClasserKlasse and MedicinrMedizin; and (iii) the reduction of ^aa& to ^a& in words such as\nWaagenrWagen \u2018car\u2019. Not included, however, was the recommendation of 1876 to abolish post-\nvocalic ^h& in items such as Sohn \u2018son\u2019, Huhn \u2018chicken\u2019, or Gef\u00fchl \u2018feeling\u2019 (see Protokoll 1901).\n5 There has been much speculation on why these discrepancies occurred. Sauer (1988:103) sug-\ngests a number of reasons, such as the speed with which the 1901 guidelines were incorporated into\nthe seventh edition of the dictionary, which appeared in 1902, allowing insufficient time for proof-\nreading. Also, the needs of printers, who had little desire for optional variability, were an obvious\ninfluence on Duden\u2019s subsequent actions. Later, deviations from the 1901 guidelines tended to be\njustified by the claim that the Duden was merely documenting actual usage within the speech\ncommunity.\n6 An article in the newspaper Die Zeit (23 February 1973), for example, suggested that three-\nquarters of all children made to repeat school years were forced to do so because of their spelling\n(cited in Clyne 1995:181\u201382). For a critical discussion of the role of dictation as a means of disci-\nplining schoolchildren, see J\u00e4ger 1974. An empirical investigation highlighting the negative impact\nof dictation on the overall achievement of working-class pupils can be found in Rigol 1977. For a\nbroader critical discussion of the teaching of spelling, see Spitta 1977.\n7 Similar arrangements were made in Switzerland and Austria. This article, however, focuses on\nthe implementation procedures and surrounding disputes within Germany.\n8 For complete text, see Deutsche Rechtschreibung 1996, a summary of which is available in\nHeller 1998. For a brief description and discussion in English, see Johnson 2000. It was also agreed\nthat a new Commission for German Orthography (Kommission f\u00fcr die deutsche Rechtschreibung),\nbased at the state-funded Institute for German Language (Institut f\u00fcr deutsche Sprache \u2013 IdS) in\nMannheim, would be established,with the specific remit of overseeing the introduction of the reform,\nmonitoring future developments in German orthography, and making further gradual revisions.\n9 References are to specific parts of the document, e.g., section I.2.aa or I.1c.9.\n10 This does, in fact, sideline the issue that by 1996 many other revised dictionaries would also be\navailable, including that of Duden\u2019s main rival, Bertelsmann. In this regard, Gr\u00f6schner has been\nwidely criticized for overestimating the significance of the Duden dictionary in the reform process, as\nwell as the role played by its editors (see e.g., Zabel 1996:359\u2013 60; Hufeld 1996:1076). But whether\nthose other dictionaries could ever really compete on a level playing field with the Duden, given the\nlatter\u2019s long-term position of authority, was and still is open to debate, and it was Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s belief\nthat the Duden was seen by the population as authoritative in questions of orthography, which was\ncentral to his argument.\n11 Most schoolteachers and university professors in Germany have civil-servant status, hence\nGr\u00f6schner\u2019s recognition that he would be formally obliged to conform to the new guidelines on\northography in his professional correspondence, and the concomitant emphasis here on his private\ncorrespondence.\nO N T H E O R I G I N O F L I N G U I S T I C N O R M S\nLanguage in Society 31:4 (2002) 571\n12 Gr\u00f6schner is referring here to the creation of previously nonexistent spellings, such as K\u00e4nguru\n(formerly K\u00e4nguruh \u2018kangaroo\u2019), where the final ^h& was dropped in order to bring it in line with items\nsuch as Gnu. See Mentrup 1998 for a comprehensively illustrated rejection of Gr\u00f6schner\u2019s contention\nthat the 1901 guidelines did not make fundamental changes to German orthography at the time; see\nalso my note 4.\n13 There has been some confusion in the literature as to what kind of legislative action was being\ndemanded by the opponents of the reform. Menzel (1998:1183) points out, for example, that such\naction need not have involved the detailed specification of standard orthographic rules on the part of\nthe state, merely a parliamentary ruling clarifying responsibility for such issues (see also Bundesver-\nfassungsgericht 14 July 1998:236).\n14 It is important to note here that there is in fact constitutional provision for bringing complaints\nin advance of the implementation of disputed measures. This is possible where the measures in\nquestion will be implemented in the very near future and will lead to circumstances that will no longer\nbe rectifiable (Gersdorf 2000:10) \u2013 both of which arguably applied here.\n15 Nor does the Court ruling engage with the psycholinguistic dimension of the complaint, which\nsees the reform as a potential breach of the complainants\u2019 right to the free development of their\npersonalities in the light of its alleged impact on the spelling system already stored in their \u201cmental\nlexica.\u201d I am grateful to one of the anonymous readers of this paper for drawing this to my attention.\n16 Dahrendorf (1968:145) describes the threat of the demise of the \u201ccommunity\u201d as a result of the\nartificially imposed structures of the \u201cstate\u201d as part of the \u201cfolklore of German political conscious-\nness\u201d (my translation). Although it is certainly true that the dichotomy has been drawn on at several\nkey points in German history \u2013 Hitler, for example, promised to bring to an end the political upheavals\nof the Weimar era by appealing to the idea of the German-speaking peoples as members of a \u201ccom-\nmunity of fate\u201d or Schicksalsgemeinschaft \u2013 I will refrain from entering into a discussion here of\nwhether the invocation of the purported solidarity of the Gemeinschaft within the debate over or-\nthography is in any way \u201ctypically German.\u201d\n17 It is important to note here that German schoolteachers and university professors, when taking\nup civil servant status, are required to sign a declaration of loyalty to the constitution (see note 11).\n18 Two further petitions for temporary injunctions against the reform were also rejected by the\nFederal Constitutional Court in December 1997 (see 1 BvR 2368\/97 and 1 BvR 2264\/97). For a survey\nof the regional rulings, see Menzel 1998.\n19 In an added twist, the couple actually withdrew their case two weeks before the release of the\nCourt\u2019s ruling, arguing that the decision was already known to the press. The Court, however, justi-\nfied its decision to go ahead with the ruling given the \u201cgeneral relevance\u201d of the case for the public\n(Bundesverfassungsgericht, 14 July 1998:242\u2013 43).\n20 The 1998 ruling did not in fact signal the end of the legal dispute. In September 1998, voters in\nthe state of Schleswig-Holstein elected in a referendum to opt out of the reform (see Johnson 1999 for\ndiscussion). This was followed in July 1999 by an unsuccessful petition to halt the implementation of\nthe referendum result, brought before the Constitutional Court by parents who claimed that their\nchildren would be disadvantaged by being taught the old rules when pupils elsewhere in the German-\nspeaking areas were learning the new ones (see Bundesverfassungsgericht 1 BVQ 10099). In Sep-\ntember 1999, the result of the referendum was overturned by the regional parliament of Schleswig-\nHolstein, and pupils once again began learning the new orthographic rules. Despite an unsuccessful\nconstitutional challenge by anti-reform groups in November 1999 (see Bundesverfassungsgericht 2\nBVR 1958099), at the time of this writing the constitutional legitimacy of the decision to overturn the\nreferendum result remains unclear (see Rivers & Young 2001:176).\nR E F E R E N C E S\nAndroutsopoulos, Jannis K.
