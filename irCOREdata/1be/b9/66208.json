In this paper, we advance argu-\nments about the relationship between an organization's\nniche and evolution in the structure of its organizational\npopulation over time. We focus on the technological\nniche and processes of positioning and crowding among\nfirms in the niche space, relating them to the level of con-\ncentration among all firms in the market. Building on pre-\nvious empirical studies in organizational ecology, we\nstudy the evolution of concentration in the American\nautomobile industry from 1885 to 1981 and estimate\nmodels of the hazard of exit of individual producers from\nthe market. The findings show that niche and concentra-\ntion interact in complex ways, yielding a more unified\ndepiction of organizational evolution than typically\ndescribed or reported.\u2022\nMany analysts' accounts of the U.S. automobile industry's\ndevelopment, including conjectured reasons for particular\nfirms succeeding and failing, can be readily interpreted from\nthe perspective of the organizational niche. For instance,\nGeneral Motors' historical success against Ford is hailed by\nmany as the consequence of its early wide-ranging multiprod-\nuct market position-a broad niche, in ecological terms. In\nmore recent years, the Japanese manufacturers showed that\nthey could build a sizeable presence after entering the mar-\nket with small low-cost cars, a part of the market in which\nmajor American producers were not very competitive.\nAccording to a niche interpretation. one would say that the\nJapanese firms benefited from initial niche positions with lit-\ntle overlap from existing firms, allowing them to gain\nstrength before attempting more direct competition.\nIn the background of such niche-based processes. the com-\npetitive dynamics of the automobile industry have been dri-\nven by both cost and innovation, each of which is tied to\nscale. The scale of automobile production has increased\nsteadily over the last century, and the race to remain compet-\nitively large often constitutes a main reason why automobile\nfirms behave as they do. For instance, insider accounts of\nthe recent round of mergers among large automakers, such\nas Chrysler and Daimler, point to the increasing scale of the\nglobal industry as the critical motivation IVlasic and Stertz,\n2000). As a result of this scale orientation, the automobile\nindustry is characterized generally by a long-term evolutionary\npattern of increasing concentration.\nIndustry consolidation and a trend toward market oligopoly\nhave also marked the evolutionary paths of numerous other\nindustries. Examples from various sectors of the U.S. econo-\nmy include the wine and beer industries. the airline industry,\nthe petroleum production industry, the motion-picture distrib-\nution industry, the microcomputer industry, and the steel\nindustry, to name a few. Concentration propels the formation\nof a strong and visible market structure whose effects\ninevitably reverberate through all levels of the social system.\ninfluencing the behavior of both economic and non-economic\nactors. For instance, industrial organization economists have\n233\/Administrative Science Quarterly, 47 (2002): 233-264\nshown that a broad spectrum of a firm's activities and\nprocesses are directly affected by the rising industrial con-\ncentration: incentives to Innovate, mechanisms for price set-\nting, the expectation for investment returns and stability, bud-\ngeting for advertising expenses, and the distribution of\nwages all seem to hinge on the rising market power of a few\ndominant producers and the relationships evolving among\nthem. Yet few economists have focused on analyzing the\nsocial dimension of market structure. By Scherer's (1970:\n210) account, \"the economist IS forced, without denying their\nimportance, to view vanatlons In Industry conduct and perfor-\nmance due to differences in social structure as an unex-\nplained residual or 'noise' \" At one level, our goal here is to\ndemonstrate that this \"unexplained\" component of the con-\ntextual constraints and opportunities faced by organizations\noperating in concentrating industries contains important and\nsystematic processes of organizational evolution that analysts\ncan ill afford to Ignore.\nIn many Industnes ,n which scale prOVides an advantage, the\ngradual rise to dominance of a few large competitors is\naccompanied by a horizontal expansion of their market posi-\ntions or niches. This IS the case with the Daimler-Chrysler\nmerger In the auto Industry, the WarnerBros.-Lorimar merger\nIn the motion-picture distribution industry, the LTV-Republic\nmerger In the steel Industry, and the American-TWA merger\nIn the airline industry. Accordingly, it seems important that\nanalyses of organizational evolution In concentrating Indus-\ntries deal with questions of niche and scale simultaneously\nand how they interrelate. The answer is far from obvious and\nmight be complex. Theories of aging (Hannan et aI., 1998a),\ndensity (Hannan et aI., 1998b), niche width IDobrev, Kim, and\nHannan, 2001), scale competition (Dobrev and Carroll, 2000),\nand resource partitioning (Carroll, 1985; Boone, Broecheler,\nand Carroll, 2000) all seem to be involved. Consequently, our\nefforts here represent an attempt to integrate insights from\nthe relevant theories Into a unified empirical model of organi-\nzational evolution. To do so, we set forth a variety of\nhypotheses about how niche and scale Interrelate to produce\nvariations In organizational mortality, focusing on how niche\nprocesses change as the industry consolidates.\nIn contemporary organizational theory, the ecological per-\nspective contains the most developed notions about the\nniche Hannan and Freeman (1977) gave the concept fresh\nlegs when they linked it to models of organizational change\nand environmental selection. Their vision of the niche was\nbroad, defined to include \"all those combinations of lenviron-\nmental! resource levels at which the population can survive\nand reproduce Itself\" IHannan and Freeman, 1977: 947). Han-\nnan and Freeman (1989) made clear that the niche was an\nn-dimensional resource space, Including social, economiC,\nand political dimensions. They also distinguished between\nfundamental and realized niches, the latter representing the\nconstrained n-dimensional resource space found when com-\npetitors are present.\nThe reVitalized niche concept seeded numerous and varied\nanalyses of how organizational environments affect the viabil-\nIty of particular types of organizations le.g., Carroll, 1988;\n234{ASQ, June 2002\nEvolution of Niches\nSingh, 1990; Baum and Singh, 1994; Dobrev, 1999, 20011. It\nalso germinated several niche models about specific environ-\nmental factors, such as the age and size of the potential\nmembership base (McPherson, 1983; McPherson, Popielarz,\nand Drobnic, 1992) and the variability of consumer demand\nIFreeman and Hannan, 19831. An especially productive cur-\nrent line of work uses the locations of organizations relative\nto each other along one or a few dimensions of resource\nspace to assess competitive intensity le.g., Barnett and Car-\nroll, 1987; Baum and Mezias, 1993; Podolny, Stuart, and Han-\nnan, 1996; Baum and Haveman, 19971. As Stinchcombe\n11990: 1361 noted, \"socially organized market segments carry\ndifferent information,\" and organizational structures reflect\nthese differences.\nYet despite this progress, niche theory could still be pushed\nfurther. As Carroll and Hannan 12000) noted, contrary to much\nearly thinking, organizational ecology's most developed theo-\nries and models tend to be about organizational population\ndynamics rather than broader environmental conditions. This\nis true for niche theory as well, where concerns of niche\nwidth, position, and crowding often take precedence over\nbroader factors, including population structure. Although this\n\"micro\" orientation is justified by the strong empirical find-\nings to date, it seems to rely on an incomplete conception of\nthe niche, one grounded in the realized niche. Other broader\nenvironmental factors are not ignored entirely, but they are\nnot given much theoretical attention, usually getting relegat-\ned to the status of control variables.\nBy contrast, our efforts here reflect an attempt to tie long-\nterm changes in the broader environment in a meaningful\ntheoretical way to the micro processes within the niche. Akin\nto recent investigations by Barron (1999) and Hannan 119971,\nwe consider the overall structure of the population as an\naspect of environment. We develop arguments about the\nrelationship between an organization's technological niche\nand changes in the structure of its organizational population\nover time. We analyze processes of positioning and crowding\namong firms in the niche space and, at the environmental\nlevel, relate these processes to the level of concentration in\nthe population, following in a tradition that includes Pfeffer\nand Salancik 11978).\nWe chose to study U.S. automobile producers because this\npopulation's historical development, like that of a number of\nother industries, is characterized by a long-term trend of con-\nsolidation. Our choice of industry context is motivated in\nlarge part by an additional consideration, namely, cumulativity\nin social science. Previous studies of the U.S. automobile\nmanufacturing population have examined basic ecological\nproblems such as age, size, and density dependence (Han-\nnan et aI., 1998a, 1998b; Hannan, 1998; Carroll and Hannan,\n2000). We extend this analysis here by developing a unified\nmodel of organizational mortality. The unified model incorpo-\nrates more fully processes related to niche and scale-niche\nwidth, niche position, niche overlap, and scale competition.\nOur specifications integrate findings from the earlier studies\nof this population (examining age dependence, density\ndependence, population aging, and scale competition) with\n235\/ASO, June 2002\n,\nIt IS commonplace In organizatIOnal theory\nto claim 10 be integrative 01 vanous theo-\nretical perspectives. In one sense, our\nefforts are no different than most-we\nstnve to show how vanous processes\nmix together empirically when operallng\nSimultaneously. In another sense, we\nthink that our effort IS distinctive The\nIntegratIon that we seek occurs within a\nsingle coherent theoretical perspective\nand attempts to reconcile conflicting ele-\nments We also find that many IntegrallOn\nefforts do not bUild cumulatively on pner\nmodel specIficatIonS as exactly as we do\nhere (usmg, In particular. models In Han-\nnan at al 1998b. and Dobrav and Carrol\n20001\n2\nThough organizational ecologists have\nused Industry age to capture processes\nrelated to evolving market and social\nstructure over tIme (Hannan, 1997\nDobrav Kim, and Hannan. 200 11. IndUstry\nconcentration seems to be a more appro-\npnate covariate because we develop\npl'op:lSltlonS that link organlzahonal prop-\nerties and evolVIng IndUstry Structure\nWhile evolutIOn IS not a statIC process\nand, by definItion. must unfOld over tIme.\nthe opposite IS not true tIme can pass\nbut the IndUStry may not consolidate The\nprocesses we examine and theorIze\nabout occur because the market concen-\ntrates and partitionS, not simply because\nlime passes If one were to test our theo-\nry In an mdustry that dId not consolidate,\nor In which concentrahon declined as a\nresult of deregulahon, and do so by mea-\nsUring Industry age rather than concentra-\ntIOn, the findings would surely be at odds\nwith our predictIons\nideas developed here on how technological niche width,\nniche position, and niche overlap Interact In organizational\nevolution as concentration increases. We seek to transfer the\nIsolated progress achieved within the various fragments to a\nunified specification and to obtain better-fitting models-and\nthus more satisfYing explanations-by integrating\nprocesses.'\nTHE ORGANIZATIONAL NICHE IN AN EVOLUTIONARY\nCONTEXT\nIn conSidering the niche of an organization, we attend to the\nwidth, pOSition, and overlap With others with respect to tech-\nnology. The niche width of an organization refers to ItS vari-\nance In resource utilization (Hannan and Freeman, 1977). So,\norganizations pursuing strategies based on operations across\na wide range of environmental resources possess a Wide or\nbroad niche and would be claSSified as generalists. Specialist\norganizations pursue strategies based on operations across a\ntight band of resources, so their niches are narrow. A firm's\nposition or location in the niche can be described by the mid-\npoint of this range Its niche overlap is the degree to which\nother firms also occupy the firm's niche range. Niche-overlap\ndensity is the number of other firms whose niches fall within\nat least some part of the range. We analyze an organization's\nniche In a technological space IPodolny, Stuart, and Hannan,\n1996; Dobrev, Kim, and Hannan, 20011.\nIn examining evolution, we track changes in market concen-\ntration to consider corresponding changes in social and orga-\nnizational structure and their effects. We regard the consoli-\ndation level of a population as part of the broader\nenvironment because, unlike niche-based variables, it is rela-\ntively immutable With respect to short-term firm movements\nand strategic actions This general theoretical strategy fol-\nlows a tradition in organization theory dating back at least to\nPfeffer and Salancik (1978), who related concentration levels\nto market uncertainty. It IS analytically convenient here\nbecause the dominant long-term trend characteriZing the\nAmerican automobile market is increasing concentration 2\nOnly fifteen years after its inception, the industry witnessed\nthe operation of more than 300 automakers; already, concen-\ntration had dropped by two-thirds from ItS initial maXimum, a\ncorollary of the very small number of entrants in the first\ndecade of the industry's history. The competitive process that\nensued in the follOWing decades led to significant consolida-\ntion, and by the eve of World War II, more than nine out of\nten producers operating at the beginning of the century had\neither failed or eXited the Industry. The dominance of the Big\nThree was solidified In the postwar years, and despite the\nentry of some highly specialized firms In the late 1970s that\naccounted for a modest upturn in denSity, concentration In\nthe Industry remains high. ThiS strong consolidation occurred\nbecause during the formative years of the population, broad\nniche width (generalism) and position in the resource-rich\nmarket center conferred competitive advantages to firms\n(Chandler, 1962; Dobrev, Kim, and Hannan, 2001). Such firms\nsucceeded in dominating the market center, eliminated small-\ner generalists that fell Victim to scale-based selection, and\n236\/ASO, June 2002\n3\nThe assumptions here differ considerably\nfrom those of the original theory of niche\nwidth, in which Hannan and Freeman\n(1977, 1989) assumed that organizations\nface only one enVIronmental state at a\nPOint in time and thaI the alternation of\nstates over time Imposes contradictory\ndemands on the organization, Here the\nvarious states of the enVIronment may\nImpose complementary demands\nEvolution of Niches\ndrove concentration high. This drive to dominance by large\ngeneralists left bleak chances for success for other generalist\nfirms seeking to position themselves in the center (Dobrev\nand Carroll, 2000).\nWe build theoretical arguments against this backdrop. While\nwe recognize and model the forces underlying consolidation,\nwe do not (for reasons of space and parsimony) specify them\nhere as formal hypotheses. Instead, we focus on developing\nevolutionary arguments, those related to niche processes\nthat are transformed with population evolution. Our point of\ndeparture is resource-partitioning theory (Carroll, 1985),\nwhich we use to predict how concentration might alter the\nmortality consequences of a firm's niche width. Then, based\non an understanding of what goes on in a partitioning popula-\ntion, we develop novel theoretical arguments about how\nniche position and niche overlap change as well with consoli-\ndation. We also consider the vexing issue of niche dimen-\nsionality.\nNiche Width and the Evolution of Concentration\nWhen environments change in uncertain ways, generalist\norganizations typically display lower mortality rates than spe-\ncialists (Freeman and Hannan, 19831. Dobrev, Kim, and Han-\nnan (2001) found that this is the case for automobile manu-\nfacturers in Europe, and we expect a similar main effect of\nniche width in the U.S. But resource-partitioning theory sug-\ngests a firm's niche width does not imply the same life\nchances when the market evolves and concentrates. The\noriginal insight of the theory comes from comparing the envi-\nronmental resource space available for specialists as overall\nmarket concentration rises. Almost all important variation in\nmarket concentration derives from generalist crowding and\nconsolidation. So, the comparison can be made by measuring\nthe total area outside combined generalist targets under dif-\nferent stages of generalist competition. As the competitive\nstruggle for scale among generalists marches forward, the\nsize and target breadth of the survivors increase, but the\ncombined resources held by all generalist organizations\ndeclines somewhat (Carroll, 1985; Peli and Nooteboom,\n1999). This implies that there is more space available for spe-\ncialists (total market space minus the combined space of\ngeneralistsl when concentration is higher (fewer and larger\ngeneralistsl. As this space increases, the viability of specialist\norganizations also increases, on average. The basic empirical\nimplication is an interaction effect between niche width and\nconcentration on mortality whereby specialist organizations\nexperience improved life chances. In other words, the main\nniche-width effect of Dobrev, Kim, and Hannan (2001) is\nreversed in concentrated markets:\nHypothesis 1 IH1): As market concentratIOn shifts from low to high,\nthe effect of niche width on an organization's hazard of mortality\nshifts from negative to positive.\nResource-partitioning theory assumes a multidimensional\nenvironmental resource space. Each dimension consists of\nstates or a smooth gradient of states, and organizations\nexperience the combination simultaneously.3 That is, every\n237\/ASO, June 2002\nfirm at every point in time is located within a particular region\nof multidimensional environmental space. Within each dimen-\nsion, resources are assumed to be unevenly distributed; the\njoint distribution displays a unimodal peak representing what\nis called \"the market center\" (Boone, Carroll, and van Wit-\nteloostuijn, 2002). This means that some environmental areas\nare more bountiful or lucrative than others, potentially provid-\ning scale advantages to those organizations located there.\nThe advantages may be overwhelming. So, in analyzing orga-\nnizations in these contexts, it is imperative to attend to posi-\ntion or location within the environmental space, as well as to\nniche width. For example, specialists have great freedom in\nchoice of location; they can locate in the market center or\ntoward either end of the market. Generalists face more con-\nstraint in choice of location because a wide niche covers\nmuch of the market; yet they can still choose whether to\nlocate the midpoint of their range near the center of the mar-\nket or toward one of the peripheries. Because of their broad-\ner product scope, generalists are also more likely to possess\ntechnological niches that spread over the market center. A\nposition in this resource-rich sector of the market provides\ngeneralists with the potential to reap scale advantages, to\ngrow and expand further, which in turn makes them more\nlikely than other firms to be centrally located. So, the choices\nof technological scope and market position are inextricably\nrelated to scale, and they are mutually reinforcing. Some of\nthe benefits of being a generalist go hand in hand with scale\nadvantages that may arise partly from location in the part of\nthe market where the peaks in the dimensions of environ-\nmental resources intersect. An organization's hazard of mor-\ntality is therefore likely to increase as a function of the dis-\ntance in its position away from the market center. This\nprediction is consistent with resource-partitioning theory, in\nwhich generalists occupying the market center are expected\nto outcompete those operating in less appealing market seg-\nments.\nThe emergence of a center in a market with many producers\nmeans that consumer preferences have become concentrat-\ned on a relatively narrow range, and this crowding in the cen-\nter is likely to affect the various kinds of organizations pre-\nsent. The concentration of consumers at a center means that\nproducers who gain leadership in the center can grow very\nlarge, usually exploiting economies of scale. The center's\nattractiveness also intensifies competition among firms situ-\nated there, at least initially, as many producers seek to match\ntheir products with consumer preferences. So, while we\nexpect that crowding will increase the mortality rates of orga-\nnizations located in the center, we also expect that some\nfirms will locate away from this intensely competitive region.\nSuch effects should be especially pronounced for specialists\nlocated in the center, whose assets are fully exposed to the\nintense competition. In contrast, generalists whose niches\nspan the center can potentially offset some of the deleteri-\nous effects of crowding in the center with success in less\ncompetitive regions covered by their wide niches. But for\nboth specialists and generalists, we expect that as the\nresource-partitioning process unfolds, and concentration\nrises, the heightened competition in the center will threaten\n238\/Asa, June zooz\nEvolution of Niches\nsurvival to an extent that overrides the positional advantages\nof location in this most lucrative part of the market. So, we\nexpect another interaction effect:\nHypothesis 2 (H2): As market concentration shifts from low to high,\nthe effect of position away from the market center on an organIZa-\ntion's hazard of mortality shifts from positive to negatIve.\nNiche Dimensionality and the Evolution of Concentration\nA difficulty of applying any niche theory to organizations is\nthe inherent multidimensionality of the niche. According to\nHannan and Freeman (1977: 947), the \"(realized) niche of a\npopUlation is defined as that area in constraint space (the\nspace whose dimensions are levels of resources, etc.) in\nwhich the population outcompetes all other local populations.\nThe niche consists, then, of all those combinations of\nresource levels at which the population can survive and\nreproduce itself.\" There seems to be little debate about this\nconception. Given this multidimensionality, any rule for mea-\nsuring niche width based on observable characteristics might\nbe incomplete. This seems more likely when niche-width\nassessments use only a single dimension, as we did in this\nstudy. Of course, one would always prefer to have a fuller\nset of relevant niche-width measures, but data collection con-\nstraints are typically severe for historical populations and per-\nhaps even for contemporaneous ones (e.g., Freeman and\nHannan, 1983). And no matter how full the eventual set of\nniche-width variables deployed, the possibility of incomplete-\nness remains.\nWe try to deal with this problem conceptually, by taking scale\ninto account. We recognize that the problematic cases only\noccur when various dimensions of niche width reorder orga-\nnizations relative to each other in terms of breadth. When\nniche-width measures correspond across dimensions, incom-\npleteness presents no real problem-any measure is almost\nas good as another, including those unobserved. Nonethe-\nless, a single unobserved dimension that reclassifies a firm\nfrom, say, a specialist into a generalist causes concern. For\nexample, a firm can be a specialist in terms of a single\ndimension, say, product scope, and offer only a single prod-\nuct. Yet in terms of other, potentially unobserved dimensions,\nsuch as marketing outlets and use of advertising media, or\ndistribution channels, it can be a pronounced generalist.\nAnheuser-Busch's dominance of the American beer market\nwith light lagers is one such example: its technologically nar-\nrow product base appeals to a range of socioeconomic and\ndemographic distributions of consumers, including those con-\nstituting the bulk of the market. If a summary classification is\nrequired when measuring both sets of characteristics, and\nconstructing a combined classification is not possible, then\nAnheuser-Busch is best classified as a generalist. In our view,\nthe environmental resources on which organizations depend\nshould possess causal primacy over technological or other\nstrategic choices made by organizations in positioning them-\nselves to secure those resources. This reasoning follows\ndirectly from Hannan and Freeman's (1977, 19891 conception\nof the niche and conforms with a long line of ecological theo-\n239\/Asa, June 2002\nry dating to Park (1936), McKenzie (19261. and Hawley\n(19501.\nIn cases such as Anheuser-Busch, the main clue to the\nimportant hidden niche dimension lies in its very large scale.\nAlthough true specialists could grow very large, in order to do\nso, enVIronmental resources must be unevenly distributed In\na way that precludes the kind of scale-based competition\namong generalists discussed by Carroll and 5waminathan\n(2000) and Dobrev and Carroll (2000) This implies that the\nshape of the Joint resource distribution will be polymodal\n(Dobrev, 2000). If, Instead, the resource distribution IS Uni-\nmodal, then very large size usually implies generalism on\nsome Important enVIronmental dimension. Although this\nmight seem highly problematic for research that does not\nobserve the dimenSion, It is not likely to be so, because gen-\neralist competition tends to be primarily scale-based. As long\nas these very large firms are treated appropriately In the\nanalysIs as scale-based competitors, there should be linIe\nfallout from an Incomplete dimensionalization of their niches.\nThe Situation for very small organizations IS qUite different.\nThere is little chance that a very small organization Will be\ntreated as a scale-based competitor in any analysis, raising\nthe question of what to do if it appears as a generalist on\nobservable niche-width characteristics. For example, on a\nrecent trip to Italy, we encountered a small shop that adver-\ntised \"everything for everybody\" (\"tutto per tutti\"), an\navowedly generalist claim for a retailer. Casual inspection of\ngoods in the store gave the impression that the store offered\na wide variety of products for a diverse clientele. If that was\nall there was to know, then we would have no choice but to\nlive with this classification. But given the very small size of\nthe store, we could not help but think that on some Impor-\ntant underlying dimension of resource space, the store is a\nspecialist, perhaps an extreme specialist. Otherwise, as a\ngeneralist, it would have been devoured by the intense scale\ncompetition it would face. In this case, the store's location\nInside the central Milan train station is undoubtedly Impor-\ntant, as are ItS longer-than-usual hours of operation.\nIn many contexts, It may not be possible to Infer the opera-\ntive dimenSion at work for such chameleon-like small \"gener-\nalists.\" Moreover, there may be a number of such unob-\nserved dimensions operating In an organizational population,\nmaking direct assessment for all cases ,nfeasible. For thiS\nreason, It may make sense to regard very small size as\nreflecting specialism on one or more unobserved dimensions\nof specialism. So researchers choosing how to measure spe-\ncialism may face an inherent conceptual trade-off either to\nmeasure \"pure\" specialism along a single dimenSion or to\nrely on small size as a way of Identifying both \"pure\" and\n\"mixed\" (displaYing at once generalist and specialist charac-\nteristics along different dimensions) specialist organizations.\nIf thiS approach is appropriate, then the behavior of very\nsmall organizations should be similar to highly specialized\nones during resource-partitioning: their specialist Side should\nput them in a favorable position in concentrated markets (per\nH1). At the same time, the generalist traits of mixed special-\nists may potentially expose them to nonscale competition\n240\/Asa, June 2002\nEvolution of Niches\nfrom large generalists, like the competition for geographic\nlocation mom-and-pop stores experienced during Wal-Mart's\nearly expansion in the rural American southwest. Empirically,\nthis means that predictions about the absolute fitness of very\nsmall firms in concentrating markets are less appropriate\nthan for \"pure\" specialists. Instead, the noninvolvement of\nvery small firms in scale competition imparts a survival\nadvantage only in relation to larger generalist firms compet-\ning for the market center, yielding another expected interac-\ntion effect:\nHypothesis 3 (H3): As market concentration shifts from low to high,\nthe hazard of mortality for a very small organization becomes lower\nthan that of Its larger counterparts in the organizational population.\nHigh industry concentration often signals the partitioning of\nthe market space into two distinct segments, market center\nand periphery, and this has implications for observed niche\nwidth. While competitive intensity in the center subsides\nonce surviving generalists settle into their new and expanded\nterritories, specialist entry into the periphery reignites compe-\ntition. The intensity of this competition may resemble that\ntypical of the formative years of the population. With the evo-\nlution of market concentration, this process is replicated in\neach developing market segment in which specialists seek to\nadvance. The effects of niche width and overlap density for\nsmall organizations in concentrated markets, then, should be\nthe same as for early entrants competing for the center dur-\ning the formative years of the industry. In other words,\nresource-partitioning processes may be cyclical (Carroll,\nDobrev, and Swaminathan, 2003). If resources in the periph-\neral niches eventually increase because of early specialists'\nsuccess at legitimating the niche products, then resource\ncompetition will ensue in those niches. Just like early compe-\ntition for resources in the market center, resource competi-\ntion in the periphery is better fought by firms with broad nich-\nes. So while the niche-width effect on mortality will change\nfrom negative to positive in the market center, when high\nconcentration in the center leads to peripheral exploration, a\nbroad niche will continue to be advantageous to competitive\nprocesses unfolding on the periphery.\nConsequently, as the industry concentrates, the reversal of\nthe main niche-width effect is unlikely to affect very small\nproducers, because very small size in a scale-dominated\nindustry, as we argued in H3 above, invariably signifies spe-\ncialism on at least one unobserved environmental dimension.\nFor very small firms, broad niche width does not imply scale,\nand therefore need not incite a retaliatory response from\ndominant generalists, but simply survival protection com-\npared with a company whose only product risks rejection by\nthe market. By the logic of these arguments, substantiated\nby the historical examples, we expect that the niche-width\neffect that occurs in unconcentrated markets will also hold\nfor small firms when overall industry concentration is high.\nEmpirically, this implies a three-way interaction effect:\nHypothesis 4 (H4): As market concentrallOn shifts from low to high,\nthe effect of niche width on a very small organlzallOn's hazard of\nmortality shifts from positive to negative.\n241\/ASO, June 2002\nNiche Overlap and Evolution of Concentration\nAlthough numerous studies suggest that niche overlap corre-\nsponds to competitive crowding, others show mutualistic\neffects (see Barnett and Carroll, 1987; Hannan et aI., 19951.\nThe level of market concentration likely matters for the effect\nof niche-overlap density, and considering it might help to sort\nout such different findings. As industry structure develops\nover time, identities and positions become defined and solidi-\nfied (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983), and the patterns of organi-\nzational interaction also gradually become embedded in the\nevolving industry structure (Hannan, 1997). In concentrated\ncontexts, increases in niche-overlap density might reflect syn-\ndicate and alliance formation among new partners, rather\nthan crowding by potential competitors.\nThere are three plausible reasons why firms might bond with\nsimilar others. First, as sociological research on alliance for-\nmation suggests, well-established firms with high reputations\ntypically scrutinize potential partners and generally avoid low-\nor no-status firms for fear of damaging their own reputations\n(Han, 1994; Podolny, 1994; Stuart, 20001. Accordingly, the\nclustering of potential partners will likely occur among firms\nordered in proximity to one another on the status dimension.\nIn a concentrated market, alliance formation may occur most-\nly among large dominant generalists that have established\ndominant positions in a consolidated industry.\nSecond, in addition to protecting their reputations, dominant\nfirms in a market with a resource-rich center may be prompt-\ned to collaborate rather than compete with one another in\norder to preserve and reinforce the barriers defining the cen-\ntral area. As the resource-partitioning model posits, growth in\nthe peripheral niches of the market is often an outcome of\nthe flattening of the distribution along relevant consumer\npreferences (Carroll and Hannan, 1995). This process follows\nfrom specialists' success in redefining consumer tastes in\ntheir favor and thus threatens the positional advantage of\ngeneralists. In response, dominant firms may unite against\nthe challenge of smaller competitors and use their economic\nand social power to uphold the collective advantages of posi-\ntion in the market center.\nThird, dominant firms in a concentrated market also likely\ncompete in more than one technological arena. By definition,\ngeneralists pursue something of a hedging strategy with\nrespect to the environment. Accordingly, those that have\nwon the late-stage battle for the market center position may\nbe more differentiated from one another than those smaller\ngeneralists who competed against each other in the earlier\npre-resource-partitioning stage. This speculation rests on the\nassumption that along with the niche-width expansion experi-\nenced by surviving generalists comes an increased variability\nin the ways they can prioritize among the various internal ini-\ntiatives that stem from the different segments of their broad\nniches.\nAs generalists become more different from one another,\ninterorganizational complementarities likely increase, thereby\nyielding more opportunities for alliance formation (Nohria and\nGarcia-Pont, 19911. Recent examples include the joint effort\n242\/ASO, June 2002\nEvolution of Niches\nof the Big Three U.S. automobile firms to battle unfavorable\nindustry regulations on emissions standards, the recent mar-\nketing slant in the largest macro-breweries ad campaigns col-\nlectively countering the micro-brewery movement's claim of\nsuperior quality, and Microsoft's investment in Apple, justified\nby the expectation of greater software sales even at the cost\nof keeping a formidable competitor in the operating systems\nmarket. This reasoning is informed by research on multimar-\nket overlap showing that market differentiation increases\ngrowth rates (Haveman and Nonnemaker, 20001 and\nimproves survival chances iBaum and Korn, 19961 in concen-\ntrated industries. We extend this argument here by proposing\nthat within a single concentrated industry, relations of mutu-\nalism develop among the dominant incumbents. The market\nrationale for this behavior has been studied exhaustively by\neconomists who point out that there is a strong disincentive\nfor any competitor to engage in a competitive behavior tar-\ngeted at other incumbents, like starting a price war, in a mar-\nket in which other competitors have sufficient market power\nto retaliate swiftly by adopting the same or another equally\npointed tactic.\nBut there is also a social rationale for the evolving partner-\nships among firms in consolidated markets, given that social\nties are likely to develop among the corporate executives of\ndominant firms. The high visibility and scrutiny to which such\nhigh-level managers are exposed makes them identifiable not\njust with their firms but with the industry as a whole. At that\nlevel, they share concerns about public perceptions and\naccountability, as well as industrywide developments related\nto regulatory changes, globalization, consumer attitudes, and\nthe like. Moreover, their positions at the helm of powerful\norganizations place them in similar and highly selective and\nexclusive circles of the social elite. Additionally, career pro-\ngression in a concentrated industry implies limited choice of\ninterorganizational transfers, so ties to former coworkers eas-\nily translate into ties with current competitors. In short.\nshared concerns and personal ties may subdue the dynamic\nof direct competition in concentrated and partitioned mar-\nkets. Metaphorically, once the pie has been cut, it is in every-\none's interest to protect it. Overall, then, we expect the dele-\nterious effect of niche-overlap density on survival chances in\na fragmented market to be countered by the beneficial effect\nof firms' common position in a well-defined, established,\nstructured region of the market, namely, the market center in\na concentrated industry.\nHypothesis 5 (H5): As market concentration shifts from low to high,\nthe effect of niche-overlap density on an organization's hazard of\nmortality shifts from positive to negative.\nThe process differs for specialists exploring and redefining\nthe peripheral niches of the market. Industry concentration\nconsolidates the market center and subjects the scale com-\npetitors operating within its boundaries to various institutional\nand regulatory pressures. But the edges of the resource\nspace witness the entry of specialized producers who bet\ntheir chances on the distinct appeal of their products, which\nallows them to avoid competition. If this strategy fails, then\nthe competitive intensity to which they become subjected is\n243\/ASQ, June 2002\nessentially resource-based and increases with the number of\ndirect competitors. Under such conditions, the effect of\nniche-overlap density is the same as for early entrants com-\npeting for the center during the formative years of the\nindustry.\nConceptualizing this argument as a testable proposition\ndirects attention to the previously discussed alternative\nmeans of measuring specialism: along a single technological\ndimension or by considering small size as a proxy to identify\nall (including mixedl specialists on multiple dimensions. It\nseems unreasonable to expect that the competitive process\namong specialists will be based solely on technology or prod-\nuct range. The small scale of production on which specialists\ntypically rely precludes them from competing across a broad\ngeographic domain. In fact, small-scale organizations often\nserve customers in different geographic regions, so overlap\nin technology need not inevitably fuel competition. For exam-\nple, Climber Motor Corp. of Little Rock, Arkansas, did not\ncompete with Commonwealth Motors Co. of Juliet, Illinois,\neven though both companies specialized in producing mostly\neconomy-type cars in the early 1920s: both companies\nlacked the resources and the supplier and distributor net-\nworks necessary to offer their products in each other's mar-\nket. By contrast, Commonwealth, ancestor of the Checker\ntaxi, did compete in its market with Stutz Motor Co., which\noperated a short distance away in Indianapolis, Indiana. So, in\narguing that the reversal of the overlap-density effect (H5)\ndoes not apply to specialist organizations, we again use very\nsmall size to reflect specialism, so as to capture the essence\nof our argument in a way that the technology\/product-based\nmeasure of specialism does not. Accordingly, we predict:\nHypothesis 6 (H6): As market concentration shifts from low to high,\nthe effect of niche-overlap denSity on a very small organIzation's\nhazard of mortality shifts from negative to positive.\nSummary: Evolution of Concentration\nOur analysis develops arguments about the ecology of an\norganizational niche in an evolutionary context. At a general\nlevel, we take basic theoretical predictions about niches and\nqualify them by stage of evolution. In a nutshell, we theorize\nthat the effects of niche width, niche position, relative scale,\nand niche overlap change as the industry consolidates. Table\n1 summarizes the general logic of the hypotheses, which\ndevelop an evolutionary account of niche processes based on\nmarket concentration. During the formative years of an indus-\ntry when concentration is low, niche width and position in the\nresource-rich market center should confer competitive advan-\ntage. Firms that choose to use their profits from scale to\nexpand the firm's scope rather than to build a cost advantage\nsucceed in dominating the market center by eliminating\nsmaller generalists and driving concentration high. This drive\nto dominance by large established generalists spells doom\nfor newcomer generalist firms IH 11 seeking to advance to the\ncopious center (H21. Instead, consolidation triggers explo-\nration of the periphery, where small specialist firms have a\nbetter chance of surviving on previously uncontested terrain\n(H1 and H31. Although small specialists do not compete on\n244\/ASQ, June 2002\nEvolution of Niches\nTable 1\nSummary of Hypotheses: Evolutionary Processes Triggered by the Shift from Low to High Industry\nConcentration\nOrganizational feature\nNiche width\nDistance from market center\nSmall size\nNiche width x Small size\nNlche-overlap denSIty\nNlche-overlap density x Small sIze\nChange in effect on mortality\nwith rising concentration\nNegative ---io poSItIve\nPositive -+ negative\nPositive but weaker than for larger firms\nPoSItive -+ negative\nPositive -+ negative\nNegative ---io positive\nHypothesis\nHl\nH2\nH3\nH4\nH5\nH6\n4\nOur dataset does not include Japanese\nmanufacturers because the first Interna-\ntional automaker to start production In the\nU_S was Honda, which opened Its\nMarysville.

The\ninitially deleterious effect of overlap in the niche should trans-\nform into an advantage as market leaders realize the need to\ncooperate in a mature industry, where identities and struc-\ntures are solidified (H5). As rising concentration solidifies the\nmarket center, the door opens for specialists to pursue posi-\ntional advantages by differentiation. But if differentiation is\nnot sustainable, small firms too will engage in competition for\nresources. In that case, the relative resource scarcity in the\nperiphery will amplify the deleterious effect of niche crowd-\ning for specialists (H6). Empirically, the rising market concen-\ntration should lead to a reversal in the main effects of niche\nwidth, market position, and overlap density (H1, H2, and H51.\nBut for small specialists, the effect of niche width turns neg-\native and that of overlap density turns positive because the\nrising overall industry concentration presents these firms\nwith an opportunity to operate in the unconcentrated market\nperiphery (H4 and H6).\nMETHODS\nWe report here analyses of data on all American automobile\nproducers ever known to operate from 1885 to 1981.4 These\ndata derive from a larger collection effort that coded histories\nof automobile manufacturers worldwide, using reports of\nautomobile historians and collectors (Hannan et aI., 1995;\nCarroll and Hannan, 19951. The most comprehensive informa-\ntion comes from a multivolume encyclopedic source book\nthat provides thorough authoritative coverage: the Standard\nCatalogue of American Cars (Gunnell, Schrimpf, and Buttolph,\n1987; Flamang, 1989; Kimes and Clark, 1996; Kowalke,\n1997). Supplementary information for recent periods can also\nbe found in Kutner (1974) and Automotive News (1993).\nThe major sources organize their reports around\" marques,\"\nor product models, not firms. For instance, although Kimes\nand Clark's (1996) volume does not contain an entry for Gen-\neral Motors, it does contain entries for Chevrolet, Cadillac,\nBuick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and other marques produced at\nvarious times by General Motors. To create records for firms,\nour unit of analysis, we aggregated entries for all of a firm's\nvarious marques across time. The records contain informa-\ntion about spells of automobile production by firms but not\nabout their complete lifetimes, which sometimes involved\noperation in another industry before and\/or after a spell of\nautomobile production. In some cases, the sources do tell\n245\/Asa, June 2002\nabout the creation and destruction of the firms. Insofar as the\nsources permit. we reconstructed the organizational histories\nof the firms in these industries. The collection effort revealed\nan abundance of firms. We found data on 2,197 American\nautomakers, many of them small, short-lived, and obscure\nfirms that introduced highly novel automobile designs and\nproduction schemes.\nMortality Events\nOrganizational life histories end in a variety of ways. For\nAmerican automobile firms, the most important events asso-\nciated with the ending of an observed life history involve one\nof the following: (1) disbanding of the firm; (2) exit to another\nindustry; or (3) merger or acquisition by another firm. Dis-\nbanding means that the firm failed as a collective actor. In\nautomobile manufacturing, exit to another industry also sug-\ngests a lack of success. The other ending events are harder\nto interpret. Although merger and acquisition both result in\nthe loss of at least one independent collective actor, firms\nmerge and acquire for diverse reasons. Sometimes a firm\nflounders, and its owners seek to recover some fraction of\ntheir investment by selling the firm. In other cases, a thriving\nfirm's competencies command great value from potential\nacqulrers or merger partners. Because of the ambiguous\nmeaning of mergers and acquisitions, we based our analysis\non disbanding and exit to another industry.\nThe sources do not report exactly what happened to most\nfirms when they dropped from the set of producers, especial-\nly when spells of automobile production were short and\nwhen the scale of production was tiny. Apparently, automo-\nbile historians rarely could reconstruct the details about an\nexit unless a firm had become reasonably well established.\nKnowledge that a certain firm disbanded, was acquired, or\nleft the industry usually means that it persisted in the indus-\ntry long enough that its exit event received notice in the\npress. Our reading of the historical materials for the U.S.\nindustry indicates that most exits of unknown type were\neither disbandings or exits to other industries, so we treated\nthese two events alike: the outcome event of interest in this\nanalysis is disbanding\/exit to another industry, defined to\ninclude events of unknown type. Firms known to have ended\nby other events (merger, acquisition, etc.) were treated as\n(noninformatively) censored on the right at the times of these\nevents, per standard practice in event-history analysis.\nOrganizational tenure. We followed convention in modeling a\nfirm's tenure (u) in a particular organizational population rather\nthan its organizational age (of course, industry tenure equals\norganizational age for de novo firms!. When dates of entry\nand exit are exact or nearly exact, tenure in automobile pro-\nduction can be calculated straightforwardly, but archival\nsources vary in their precision in dating events. Sometimes\nthe sources give the exact date; other times, they give only\nthe month\/year, season\/year, or only the year. To make analy-\nsis tractable, we converted all of the information about timing\nto decimal years. Year-only dates were coded as occurring at\nthe midpoint of the year. In this case, our coding rules assign\nthe starting time to the middle of the first year and the end-\n246\/ASQ, June 2002\nEvolution of Niches\ning time to the midpoint of the next year, giving a completed\ntenure of one year, which is the expected tenure under the\nassumption of a uniform distribution. These rules, which are\nconsistent with Petersen's (19911 recommendations for deal-\ning with the problem of time aggregation, generalize to han-\ndle all the cases we encountered.\nSome firms' records indicated that they conducted other\nactivities prior to entering the automobile market. Because\nthese de alio firms likely entered with greater resource bases\nthan de novo firms, we included a dummy variable to indicate\nprior existence (prior existence). Carroll et al. (1996) showed\nthat this variable is associated initially with lower mortality\nrisks.\nWe specified the effects of organizational density (N) nonmo-\nnotonically, consistent with established theory and findings in\norganization ecology (Carroll and Hannan, 20001. to include a\nlinear and second-order term of annual counts of the number\nof producer organizations. We also included a fixed covariate\nfor each firm measuring density at the time of its founding\n(density at entry). Following Hannan (1997), we interacted\nthe effects of the contemporaneous density variables with a\nset of variables measuring the age of the population (industry\nage). This specification allows the effects of density to vary\nas a function of population age.\nWe measured organizational size as scale of operations,\nspecifically, the firm's annual production of automobiles. We\nanalyzed the main effects of size on firm mortality by using\nthe natural logarithm of this value, Ln(SizeJ. Following previ-\nous analyses of automobile populations (Hannan et aI.,\n1998a, 1998b), we also measured the relative size of a firm\nas the ratio of each firm's size to the size of the largest firm\nin the national population at the time (relative sizel. The use\nof this variable coupled with the absolute size measure\nallowed us to parse out the absolute size effects. Negative\n(absolute) size dependence occurs because large firms have\na greater capacity to produce new knowledge (through\ngreater R&D expenditures), to extract value through efficien-\ncies and complementarities stemming from an elaborate divi-\nsion of labor, and to benefit from economies of learning,\nmanagerial skills, etc. These are advantages that large firms\nwould enjoy even if no small firms existed in the industry. By\ncontrast, relative size only relates to advantages like scale\nand position derived by large firms vis-a-vis their smaller com-\npetitors. Further, while the absolute-size effect captures the\nadvantages of large organizations, small organizations have\nhigher failure rates not only because they lack these advan-\ntages but also because their thin resource supplies imply nar-\nrow margins of error and thus make them extremely vulnera-\nble to market uncertainty (Levinthal, 1991). To capture this\ncompounded absolute-small-size disadvantage, we used a\ndummy variable for size less than or equal to an annual pro-\nduction of 50 cars (size';; 5Cli.\nMarket concentration. Variations in the industry size distribu-\ntion that may give rise to the emergence of structure and\nmarket partitioning are captured by our measure of market\nconcentration. We relied on the frequently used concentra-\n247\/ASO, June 2002\ntion-ratio measure, defined as the ratio of the annual produc-\ntion of the four largest firms to the total industry output for\nthat year (C4). For our analysis, this measure has an advan-\ntage over other concentration measures because it captures\nwell the process of consolidation in the market center, where\nonly a few firms are able to dominate, which has been the\ncase in the U.S. automobile industry. The measure implies\nthat as the combined market share of the top four industry\nfirms increases, concentration increases proportionately. It\nalso implies that if the market in any given year consists of\nfour or fewer producers, concentration will equal one, even if\nproduction is evenly divided among them. This is not a con-\ncern in our analysis, however, because we used two other\nsize-based measures to account for positional and scale dif-\nferences among individual firms: relative size and scale com-\npetition (described below).\nOrganizational ecologists have pointed to a pattern of density\nevolution that holds across a wide range of industries, includ-\ning the U.S. automobile industry: the number of organizations\ninitially grows slowly until the form acquires taken-for-grant-\nedness, causing density after that point to increase steeply\n(Hannan and Carroll, 1992; Carroll and Hannan, 2000). As the\ncarrying capacity of the population is reached and competi-\ntion sets in, the number of firms decreases, reflecting the\nconsolidation of the market. The subsequent entry of special-\nists leads to a modest resurgence of density in scale-domi-\nnated industries. One important implication of this density\npattern for interpreting variation in concentration is that the\nslow increase in the number of firms in the early years of the\nindustry confines our measure of concentration to equal 1\nuntil at least five firms are present on the market. Because\nour thesis rests on the argument that rising concentration\nsolidifies industry structure, and because high market con-\ncentration in the very early years of the industry clearly does\nnot signify this theorized process, we estimated models in\nwhich we controlled for the effect of high concentration dur-\ning that initial period.\nScale competition. Scale economies exert their force in orga-\nnizational evolution because of the worsened consequences\nlikely experienced by small firms with relatively higher costs\nin competition with larger firms. The competitive pressure\nvaries depending on where a firm sits in the size distribution\nrelative to its competitors. This pressure can be modeled by\nexamining the size structure of the competitive environment\nfaced by each scale competitor at any point in time (Carroll\nand Swaminathan, 2000; Dobrev and Carroll, 2000). Examin-\ning the exact position of each scale competitor in relation to\nits peers reveals not only the extent of its economic advan-\ntage related to lower cost but also indicates political and insti-\ntutional advantages derived from special treatment from poli-\ncymakers and regulators. The selection mechanism proposed\nby the scale-competition model has been shown to operate\nconsistently among firms in industries as diverse as macro-\nbrewers (Carroll and Swaminathan, 2000) and automobile\nproducers in Europe and the US. (Dobrev and Carroll, 2000).\nAlthough the logic of the theory easily generalizes to all mar-\nkets and industries in which incumbents compete on scale,\nZ48\/ASO, June 2002\n5\nIn our View, these are conservative cutoff\nPOints that do not exclude many small\nfirms perhaps not subject to strong scale\npressure. More generally, although the\npool of scale competitors identIfied in any\nindustry charactenzed by scale competi-\ntion should conform to the same dynam-\nics predicted by our model of scale-based\nselection, the cutoff POint used to identify\nscale competitors should be industry spe-\ncifiC and derived from the particular pro-\nductIOn system, minimum efficient scale.\nand other industry-specific Idiosyncrasies\nNevertheless, we perlormed sensitivity\nanalyses to assure the robustness of our\nresults based on a cutoff of less than or\nequal to 50 production units, We estimat-\ned two additional models In the first one,\nwe counted all firms in calculating the\nscale-selection measure.

Ideally, one\nwould use data on both supply (e.g., production capacity,\nlevel of utilization, cost structure) and demand le.g., existing\nand prospective customer base per model, per company, per\nyearl market characteristics to classify firms. In a situation\nlikely to be common among researchers, we did not have\nsuch detailed data, so we developed an alternative.\nWe used a size threshold to identify the subset of scale com-\npetitors, following Dobrev and Carroll (20001, who demon-\nstrated that, in fact, U.S. autofirms with annual production of\nless than or equal to 50 cars conform to a different schedule\nof mortality and respond differently to industry\nconsolidation. 5 We also used this cutoff point to identify the\nsubset of large firms likely to experience scale-based selec-\ntion. For these firms, we used the scale competition variable\ndeveloped by Carroll and Swaminathan (20001 and Dobrev\nand Carroll (20001 and measured the aggregate distance of all\nlarger firms from the focal firm. To calculate it, we first found\neach firm's position at each point in time on a downward\nsloping curve represented by the inverse quadratic root of\nthe size variable S, aher adjusting for minimum size\" The cal-\nculation is given by (S\" - Sm,n)-'\/4; the curve generated by this\nequation resembles the general long-run average cost curve\nposited by economic theory for economies of scale. After\nlocating firms' positions on the curve, we then computed the\naggregate distance of each firm i from its larger competitors\nby summing the differences in scores as:\n5 I .. - D - ~ (5 - 5 )-114 - (5 - 5 )-114ca e competition - (\\ - (I min jt mm .\ns~ > \u2022\nAs the formula indicates, the greater the number of larger\ncompetitors a firm faces, the greater the competitive pres-\nsure it confronts, all other things being equal. The contribu-\ntion of each larger firm to its competitive pressure depends\non the firm's exact location. When the focal firm is small,\nthen a unit size difference creates more pressure than when\nit is large. Put another way, the same difference in scale\nbetween two firms generates more competitive pressure for\nthe smaller firm when its absolute size is small than when its\nabsolute size is large.\nNiche profile variables. Following Dobrev, Kim, and Hannan\n(2001), we defined technological niche width INlM as the\nrange of engine capacity in terms of horsepower across all\nmodels produced by each firm at any given point in time (a\nrealized nichel. By this view, producers define themselves by\nchoosing an array of products. Specialists offer products with\na small range of variation on the dimension; generalists dis-\nplaya broad range. For example, the specialist Bartholomew\nCo. of Peoria, Illinois, in 1919 offered a single model (the\nGlide, with engine horsepower of 45), and the more general-\nist South Bend, Indiana-based Studebaker Corp. in 1953\nz49\/Asa, June 2002\nmade cars with engines ranging from 147 to 270 horsepow-\ner Measurement of niche width in this way implies that a\nfirm is capable of producing engines (and bears the costs of\nproductionl for all values within its range, whether it actually\ndoes or not. Combining the technological niches of all exist-\ning firms in any given year produces a picture of the market\nboundaries in technological space at any point in time. The\nevolution of the technological space in which U.S. auto man-\nufacturers operated between 1885 and 1981 is presented in\nfigure 1.\nNiche overlap density (NOI is the count of firms whose nich-\nes overlap with the niche of the focal firm. Although there\nare different ways to compute niche overlap, we chose to\nuse a density measure because it is a better fit with our\nhypotheses. A more complex alternative would have been to\nweigh the overlaps based on the portion of the niche that\noverlaps with that of competitors IBaum and Singh, 19941.\nThe market center covers the range of the niches of the four\nlargest firms in the industry. This measure of the market cen-\nter follows the logic of the concentration measure described\nabove. If the four largest firms in the industry provide a\ntelling example of the level of concentration, then the range\nof their niches should provide an adequate description of the\nmost resource-abundant segment in the market, where the\ndominant players position themselves. We used the midpoint\nof a firm's technological product range to indicate its niche\nposition in the market.

We estimated the effects\nof the distances of firms both\" above\" the market center\n(position: DAMq, meaning a niche width that contains a larg-\ner engine capacity than the center, and \"below\" the market\ncenter (position: DBMq.\nMeasuring organizational niches along a single dimension-\ntechnological scope, in our case-has its limitations. If our\nmeasures of niche width and overlap density capture only\nmarket position and competitive dynamics in technological\nspace, then they would be less than ideal for testing the the-\noretical propositions stated in the previous section. But defin-\ning organizational niches along a technology dimension has\ncompensating advantages. Most important, it provides us\nwith a means of making meaningful comparisons of firms\nthat have existed in disparate historical periods, allowing us\nto analyze the evolution of the industry from its origins. It\nmakes it possible to draw as complete a picture as possible\n(given the paucity of information for many of the entries in\nour datasetl of the overall market niches of the automobile\nfirms whose fates we analyze. We think that technological\nniches in this industry are informative about market position\nbecause, upon examination, the choice of engine capacity\nmade by automobile producers over the years reveals not\nonly the ranges of their technological offerings but also these\nfirms' strategies in product marketing and competitive pric-\ning, customer segment targeting, supply-chain management,\nand innovation. Some examples, drawn from the historical\nmaterials we used, illustrate these points. Indicative of the\ntight coupling between engine capacity and product design\nwas the new Cadillac model General Motors (GM) introduced\nin 1934; it extended GM's technological niche further. The\n16-cylinder, 185-horsepower engine came packed in a luxuri-\nous body style in which \"the wheelbase was stretched to a\nmammoth 154 inches making the Cadillac America's lengthi-\nest production car.... The bodies were elegant and included\nthe striking and provocatively named Madame X\" (Kimes and\nClark, 1996: 200). Evidently, GM not only built a more power-\nful engine to propel a fashionably styled car but also used it\nas an occasion to spice up its marketing effort. Pricing strate-\ngies, too, have always been closely tied to the variation in\nengine capacity. For example, between 1902 and 1910, Knox,\nbased in Springfield, Massachusetts, transitioned from selling\na 5-horsepower runabout (affectionately called \"Old Porcu-\npine\") in the $1,000 price range to offering a 60-horsepower\nlimousine priced for as much as $6,400.\nThe technological niche also reflects a firm's competitive\nmarket strategy. For example, at a time when other compa-\nnies were aspiring to prove the universal nature of their prod-\nuct by competing in road races and hill climbs, Detroit Elec-\ntric \"was always careful to insist that its product was not a\ntouring car.... It was an urban vehicle, one for women dri-\nvers especially\" (Kimes and Clark, 1996: 444). This narrOw-\nniche manufacturer appealed to a then-small customer seg-\n251\/ASO, June 2002\nment by relying on what we would categorically describe as\na specialist strategy. Variations in technological product offer-\nings also relate well to intangible strategic resources such as\nreputational benefits. Industry historians continue to debate if\nPackard's move into the lower end of the market resulted \"in\na loss of prestige to the Packard luxury car image from which\nthe company never recovered\" (Kimes and Clark, 1996:\n1106). Our reading of the data sources also suggests that in\nmany cases the adoption of a new technology had profound\nrepercussions not only for the overall image of the company\nbut for its internal scope and design, shifting firm boundaries\nboth vertically and horizontally: \"In 1911 Sterns became a\ndistinctive car of another kind when the firm acquired the\nfirst American license to the Knight engine\" (Kimes and\nClark, 1996: 1388). This event not only had a profound impact\non the company's range of models with varying engine\ncapacity but also necessitated a subsequent acquisition of a\nfactory specifically dedicated to the production of the Knight\nengine.\nSocioeconomic environmental factors. We also controlled for\nsocioeconomic environmental conditions. The estimates\nreported below are from specifications that include effects of\neconomic depression Idepression year dummies), the level of\nthe gross domestic product IGOA adjusted for inflation\nItaken from Maddison, 1991}, and dummy period effects rep-\nresenting industry regimes Imass production, product differ-\nentiation, JITrrQCi as defined by Womack, Jones, and Roos\n11990). We excluded the years of the Second World War\nfrom the analysis because the production of motor vehicles\nfor private use was minimized for the duration of the war in\nthe U.S. This specification of socioeconomic environmental\nfactors parallels those of Hannan et al. (1998a, 1998bl and\nallows for precise model comparisons.\nModel Specification and Estimation\nWe represented variation in organizational tenure lui as a sto-\nchastic piecewise-exponential function where the breakpoints\nfor the pieces are denoted as a S 7, S 7, S ... S 7 p. Assuming\nthat 7 p+, =~, there are P periods: lp = {u I7 pSuS 7 p+,}, P =\n1, \"', P. After examining life tables and exploring estimates\nof a variety of choices for the breakpoints, we decided to\nbreak the duration scale (in years) at 0.5, 1.0,3.0, and 7.0.\nWith this choice, the first segment 10,0.51 includes dated\nevents that occur within the first six months in the industry\nand cases that enter and exit at unknown times within the\nsame year, as discussed above. The second segment 10.5,11\nincludes dated events that occur within the second six\nmonths and cases that enter at an unknown time in one year\nand exit at an unknown time in the next year. The third and\nfourth segments are defined similarly. The final segment\nbegins at seven years and is open on the right.\nWe built cumulatively on previous findings to estimate a uni-\nfied model of organizational evolution. These findings include\nspecifications of tenure dependence, size dependence, and\ndensity dependence ICarroll et aI., 1996; Hannan et aI.,\n1998a, 1998b) and scale competition IDobrev and Carroll,\n20001 Given the complexity of the ideas in the hypotheses\n252\/ASQ, June 2002\nEvolution of Niches\nand the models, we do not dwell on estimates of each of\nthese effects but simply report them. Their inclusion, howev-\ner, is central to our claims of building a unified model.\nIn modeling organizational mortality in the U.S. and other\nautomobile industries, Hannan et al. 11998al explored a non-\nproportional rate model for combining size and tenure\neffects. In simple terms, the nonproportionality facet of the\nmodel allows the effects of size and tenure to interact in\ncomplex ways by yielding different coefficients for size\neffects at various tenure segments. Hannan et al.'s 11998al\nestimates showed that the assumption of proportionality of\nthe effects of size does not fit well the histories of popula-\ntions of automobile manufacturers in major countries of\nEurope and in the U.S. That is, allowing nonproportional\neffects statistically improves model fit, even after taking into\naccount changes in the degrees of freedom. We used the\nspecification here when it improved fit. To be more precise,\nwe specify that the disbanding\/exit rate fL, is a function of\ntenure in the industry lui, industry age (tl. a vector of vari-\nables (s',ul pertaining to size labsolute and relative size,\naggregate distance from larger competitors, and dummy for\nvery small sizel, a vector of other measured covariates (x',1\nincluding GNp, depression year, and density at founding, a\nfunction of contemporaneous density and density squared, as\nwell as the interactions of these density effects and industry\nage, denoted by q>(N\"tI. The functions for assessing the argu-\nments made in the hypotheses relate to niche width (NWI.\nmarket position (POSI, niche overlap density (NO), and con-\ncentration IC4), denoted by ljIINW\", NO,u' POS,u,C4,). The gen-\neral class of models we estimate has the form:\n1..l)U,tl = exp(mp) exp(s'luo.p + X'tn}' l.p(Nt,t)\u00b7\ntjI(NW\",NO\",POS,u' C4,1. u E Ip\nHere mp denotes a set of tenure-specific effects; the log-lin-\near link imposes the constraint that the baseline hazards be\nnon-negative. The (tenure) period subscript on the vector of\nsize coefficients indicates that we allowed some of these\neffects to vary by tenure. This general specification sets the\nhazard of disbanding\/exiting to be a nonproportional function\nof tenure and these covariates. In basic tests of the hypothe-\nses, we estimated models with this general form with the\nmethod of maximum likelihood as implemented in TDA 5.7\n(Rohwer, 1994; Blossfeld and Rohwer, 1995).\nSpecifying empirical tests for each of the hypotheses\nrequired that we model interaction effects between industry\nconcentration and each of the organizational variables perti-\nnent to the specific hypothesis. In each case, interpreting the\neffect requires combining the effect of the main term with\nthe effect of the interaction term. For example, to confirm\nH1, we need to show that the niche-width effect becomes\npositive when concentration rises; the relevant effect con-\nsists of the baseline niche-width effect and the interaction\neffect between niche width and industry concentration.\n253\/ASO, June 2002\nFINDINGS\nTable 2 presents the basic descriptive statistics of the vari-\nables in the event-history file, and the sequence of models in\ntables 3 and 4 build on each other to yield tests of the\nhypotheses. The estimates from a baseline specification\nappear in the first column of table 3 (model 11, which repli-\ncates all but one of the main findings of Hannan et al. (1998a,\n1998bl. The effect of tenure on the rate is U-shaped,\ndecreasing the hazard during the first seven years but revers-\ning direction from that point on. In addition to the beneficial\neffect of relative size, the nonproportional effect of absolute\nsize suggests that its negative effect on the hazard increases\nwith industry tenure. Meanwhile, the deleterious effect of\nvery small size seems to wear off after the firm's seventh\nyear in the industry. Industry concentration shows a positive\nbut only marginally significant baseline effect on the rate. The\nestimates of the main effects of density and its interactions\nwith industry age all agree with the predictions of density\ndependence; all density coefficients except one are highly\nsignificant. The positive and statistically significant effect of\ndensity at entry on the hazard supports the density delay\nargument.\nModell departs from the models of Hannan et al. (1998a,\n1998bl in that it includes the concentration variable. We put it\nin all our specifications because of the central role it plays in\nthe hypotheses. Inclusion of this variable in the baseline\nmodel 1 weakens the negative effect of the very-small-size\ndummy in the late-tenure period (after seventh year), which\nwas statistically significant in the earlier studies. Per H3, this\nvariable may have lost its statistical power because model 1\nis not fully specified: the very-small-size dummy must be\ninteracted with concentration in order to show its effect once\na main effect of concentration is included. So, to understand\nthe action in the variables in this specification before moving\nto the more specific niche-based variables, we begin hypoth-\nesis testing by turning to this size-based measure of special-\nism first and the predictions of H3.\nModel 2 shows the estimates of the baseline model with the\nadded interaction of small size and concentration.

The predicted effects of inter-\nest, concentration by very small size, are plotted in figure 2.\nThe estimated main effect implies that high concentration\nincreases the rate more than ten times for relatively large\nfirms, but only by about half for very small firms.

Small size per-\nforms the function of a shield against scale competition,\nwhich significantly decreases the survival chances of large\n(but not the largest) firms.

We did so by\nadding an interaction term between\nindustry concentration and a pre-1905\ndummy to the model In table 4 Including\nthis additIOnal parameter did not affect\nthe rest of the estimates: Its effect was\nstatistically Insignificant, and model fit did\nnot Improve. Consequently, we conclude\nthat our model IS not misspeclfied as a\nresult of the U\u00b7shaped pattern of concen\u00b7\ntratlon\nmodel becomes stronger and statistically significant. So, in\naccord with predictions of resource partitioning, scale-based\nselection, and si2e-locali2ed competition theories, we find\nthat while concentration increases the ha2ard, this effect is\nmitigated by very small si2e.\nTechnological Niche Width and Position\nTable 4 shows the results of a complete model specification\nincluding the relevant niche-width and overlap-density-related\nvariables' The interaction effects between the niche-width\nvariables and industry concentration in model 3 show that, as\npredicted by H1 and H2, the directions of the main effects\nreverse. When interacted with industry concentration, the\neffect of niche width changes from negative to positive, and\nthe effects of position distance from the market center\nchange from positive to negative. All coefficients are signifi-\ncant, except for position in the high end of the market center.\nThe niche-width and the low-end-position (DBMCI effects are\npresented graphically in figures 3 and 4, respectively. For\nniche width, concentration not only stifles the main effect but\naltogether transforms broad niche into a liability for survival.\nAccording to the results and figure 4, as the market concen-\ntrates, position in the low periphery (i.e., away from the mar-\nket centerl proves beneficial to the extent that it confers sur-\nvival advantage to firms located there relative to\nmarket-center competitors.

For example, Wayne Works,\nInc., Martin Wasp Corp., Napoleon Motors Co., and many\nother producers made successful inroads in the market in the\n1920s as concentration neared its peak. Enthused by their\nearly success. these producers expanded their product lines\nwith new offerings that covered the market center. But these\nmoves brought them into direct competition with the estab-\nlished and much larger industry leaders, and the subsequent\nscale competition spelled doom for the upstarts.\nFocusing on size differences among specialists, we conjec-\ntured in H4 that as the market becomes concentrated and\nthe periphery expands, a narrow niche constitutes a disad-\nvantage for small firms. This conjecture is supported by the\nhistorical record. For example, a peripheral niche that\n257\/ASO, June 2002\nFigure 3.

Among the firms that entered this segment, the\nlongest surviving one was the Boulevard Motor Works, a firm\nthat\" offered several different models, each ... [with] differ-\nent power depending on the number of electric motors\nused\" (Kowalke, 1997: 8241. The ironically dubbed \"American\nBMW\" remained in existence for 16 years, far outlasting\nother electric car producers. Another example, at the high\nend of the specialized market periphery, comes from the\nstrategic position occupied by Shelby-Amer, Inc. This South-\nern California company produced a number of different\nmodel sports cars with engine horse power ranging from 250\nto 450 (i.e., it had a wide niche width). The success of the\ncompany is well documented: it manufactured \"one of the\nbest performing and best selling American specialty cars ever\nproduced\" (Kowalke, 1997: 860). Despite these examples,\nthe empirical test of H4 is insufficient to reject the null\nhypothesis: although, consistent with our expectation, the\neffect of niche width interacted with industry concentration\nand very small size is negative, it is not significant.\nThe effects for overlap density show that consolidation turns\nthe positive main effect around. As concentration rises, the\noverall combined overlap density effect becomes negative,\nnot just the interaction effect.

Nevertheless, to test the robustness of our findings\nabout overlap density and concentration, we experimented\nwith an alternative hypothesis: that the reversal of the over-\nlap effect from positive to negative reflects the increasing\ndimensionality of organizational niches and that industry con-\ncentration simply fits in as a proxy for this process. Separat-\ning the two processes (dimensionalization and cooperation) is\nimportant because, while we fully concur that the two\nprocesses unfold simultaneously, and this is part of our argu-\nment. we also think It unlikely that mutualism will occur\nwhen the market is unsettled and resource competition is\nintense. We tested for this alternative explanation by includ-\ning an additional Interaction of overlap density and industry\nage. Although its effect was negative and significant. it did\nnot eliminate the significant negative effect of overlap densi-\nty and concentration. We conclude that our finding does sup-\nport H5.\nFinally, for H6, we reasoned that as the market concentrates,\nthe center will become consolidated and structured, while\nresource-based competition will take place in the periphery.\nSo, for small specialists in quickly appreciating market niches\nthat invite the entry of competitors, overlap density would\nsignify a threat more than an opportunity for cooperation. As\nanticipated, the three-way interaction between overlap densi-\nty, industry concentration, and very small size is positive, but\nonly marginally significant at the .10 level. We cannot conclu-\nsively state that the effect of overlap density in concentrated\nmarkets is different for very small producers than it is for all\nother firms.\n259\/Asa, June 2002\nFigure 5.

This view accords\nwith that of industry historians such as Rae (1984: 641. who\nobserved about the 1920s, \"When the boom period began,\nDurant Motors, Studebaker, Hudson-Essex, Maxwell and\nWillys-Overland could all conceivably have been competitors\nof General Motors and Ford.\" To date, ecological research on\nthe automobile industry has focused on modeling basic evo-\nlutionary processes involving organizational age, entry mode,\nsize, and density (e.g., Carroll and Hannan, 1995; Carroll et\naI., 1996; Kim, Dobrev, and Solari, 2001). One set of studies\ndemonstrated that organizational populations of automobile\nproducers undergo the expected density-dependent process-\nes of legitimation and competition (Hannan and Carroll,\n1992). These studies also showed that the geographic scale\nof the legitimation process operates more broadly than com-\npetition, transcending regional and national boundaries, while\ncompetition tends to be more localized (Hannan et aI., 1995;\nBigelow et aI., 1997). Empirical research on national automo-\nbile populations has also spawned a theory of population iner-\ntia and a corresponding specification of the density model\nthat interacts the basIc processes with population age (Han-\nnan, 1997).\nIn another set of studies, organizational size figures promi-\nnently. Studying several national automobile populations,\n260\/ASO, June 2002\nEvolution of Niches\nHannan et al. (1998al showed that the effects of organiza-\ntional size and mortality may emanate from both absolute\nand relative firm size. Moreover, the effects of size on firm\nmortality appear to be nonmonotonic and nonproportional\nwith respect to a firm's tenure in the industry, suggesting an\ninteraction between size (growth) and processes linked to\norganizational aging, the so-called liabilities of newness, ado-\nlescence, obsolescence, and senescence. The apparent com-\nplexity of size effects presents a theoretical challenge. In\naddressing the issue, Dobrev and Carroll (2000) used a model\nof scale-based selection to explain mortality among automo-\nbile producers The model assesses the competitive intensity\na firm confronts In the marketplace; It takes Into account the\nfirm's position In the size distribution and its distance relative\nto competitors. Empirical estimates based on the model sug-\ngest strongly that relative scale drives selection among large\nautomobile producers With positive feedback, a result consis-\ntent with many other accounts.\nA more recent set of studies has begun to investigate ques-\ntions about automobile firms' product market positions and\nthe segmentation of producer populations. These efforts\nwere motivated in large part by the changing technology and\nhistorically defined patterns of competitive segmentation that\nhave characterized the automobile industry (Womack, Jones,\nand Roos, 1990). In the ecological perspective, motivation\nalso derives from an empirical finding in Hannan et al.'s\n(1998al study of age and size that suggests the operation of\nresource-partitioning (segmentation) processes in the Ameri-\ncan industry. The finding is that very small firms show\nenhanced life chances at later ages, despite generally nega-\ntive consequences of both small size and old age.\nDobrev, Kim, and Hannan's (2001) study directly examined\nquestions about positioning and segmentation of firms in the\nEuropean automobile industries, using conceptualizations of\nthe technological niche exactly like ours. In analyzing produc-\ner mortality, Dobrev, Kim, and Hannan (2001) found that\nbroad niche width lowers rates of death but that niche over-\nlap heightens the risk of mortality to an extent that more than\noffsets the broad niche advantage. Their study also shows\nthat mortality chances rise when a producer firm substantially\nchanges ItS niche Width or its position.\nTaken together, the findings from this stream of ecological\nresearch demonstrate the operation of several different fun-\ndamental processes In populations of automobile producers.\nBut the question of integration remains: How well do the var-\nious theoretical fragments fit together? What type of integra-\ntive theory is needed? At its most general level, our goal here\nwas to incorporate relevant theoretical ideas and models\nfrom organizational ecology and to integrate them into a com-\nprehensive evolutionary analysis of the U.S. automobile\nindustry. In doing so, we developed theory about how nlche-\nbased processes operate and change as the industry evolves\ntoward increasing concentration. This approach directs atten-\ntion to the broader evolutionary environment without under-\nmining recent advances in understanding competition and\ncrowding in the local environment.\n261\/ASQ, June 200Z\nREFERENCES\nThe empirical findings show the value of reconciling various\ntheories about the niche in evolutionary relief. Consistent\nwith much previous research, our findings extend this work\nby considering how niche processes change as a market con-\ncentrates. The empirical analysis suggests three new twists\non established ecological reasoning. First, we found that both\nniche width and position in the favorable market center lower\norganizational mortality rates. Yet we also found that the\neffects of niche Width and position depend on the overall\nconsolidation of the Industry, reversing themselves in cases\nof high concentration. Second, we found that scale competi-\ntion is intense among most automobile producers but that\nthe smallest producers benefit from a highly concentrated\nmarket. Third, we found that crowding within a firm's specific\ntechnological niche elevates mortality, yet when concentra-\ntion is high, crowding seems beneficial. Overall, these find-\nings suggest to us that organizational theories of the niche\nwould benefit by attending to evolutionary changes in the\nbroad enVIronment as well as to details of competition and\nlocation within the local environment.\nAutomotive News\n1993 Amenca at the Wheel: 100\nYears of the Automobile In\nAmerica Sept 4 Special\nIssue\nBarnett, W.
