However not all projects achieve such suc-\ncessful outcomes. Their destiny relies on the capacity of project\nmaintainers to attract new members, to develop policies to secure\ncontributors\u2019 commitment, and to promote high standards.\nThe question of forging a sustainable community of active con-\ntributors is particularly crucial for individuals, companies and orga-\nnizations willing to launch and develop wiki-based projects. This\nissue relates more broadly to the understanding of the general dy-\nnamics of content-based communities and, therefore, calls for re-\nsearch on a wide range of wikis at various stages of development.\nPrevious studies have mainly focused on Wikipedia. While of great\ninterest, it seems difficult to build on this knowledge to develop\na more comprehensive theory of the social structure and content\ndynamics of wikis\u2014Wikipedia is a special case in many respects\n(population, maturity, topical range, and media attention, among\nother indicators). A comprehensive analysis of wiki dynamics is\nfurther hindered by the heterogeneity of wiki platforms and by the\nlack of tools and methods to collect data in a standardized way.\nNevertheless, a first approach to generalisation can be achieved by\nexamining a set of wikis that share the same platform.\nIn the following sections, we present an analysis of the evolution\nof a large sample of wikis based on the MediaWiki engine. In par-\nticular, we investigate some indicators that correlate with different\ngrowth rates, as a preliminary step towards a full-fledged under-\nstanding of factors that determine different patterns of evolution.\nWiki ecology: demographics and viability\nThe literature on the dynamics of Web-based communities is rel-\natively scarce [6, 9] and, to our knowledge, the present study rep-\nresents the first longitudinal analysis of the content and popula-\ntion dynamics of a large set of wikis over time using data retrieved\nvia an API-based service. As well as almost always focusing on\nWikipedia, previous quantitative wiki research has mainly exam-\nined the topological structure of underlying interaction or hyperlink\nnetworks [3, 12] or article-level features [1, 11], with little interest\nin the specific dynamics of the demographic determinants them-\nselves (with the exception of [8] which investigates Wikipedia\u2019s\ndemographics of casual vs. committed contributors). In a previous\nstudy of a static dataset describing wikis we provided a glimpse of\nthe demographic structure of a portion of the wikisphere in terms\nof both population and content sizes, but stopped short of investi-\ngating its evolution.[10]\nAs content-based online communities, wikis most significantly\nvary in two dimensions: (i) contributors, who may or may not con-\nstitute an active community (as described e.g. in [2]); and (ii) pages,\nwhich may or may not amount to authoritative or useful content (as\ndemonstrated for example by [4]). Users and pages are likely to\nobey a dual dynamic: while more users may contribute to more\npages, content proliferation in turn seems to require more attention\nfrom users. As a first approximation, it may thus seem judicious\nto assess the healthiness of a wiki through these variables, taken as\ndemographic proxies for its actual growth and activity.1\n2. EMPIRICAL PROTOCOL\n2.1 Dataset\nWe constructed a dataset made of simple statistics gathered for\na large number of MediaWiki-based wikis,2 which enabled us to\nconsider the same set of variables across all wikis and make sure\nthese variables were generally available. The data was collected\nover the period August 2007\u2013April 2008 from a publicly-available\ndatabase3 totaling 11 500+ wikis.\n2.2 Variables\nWe considered a set of four quantitative variables:\n\u2022 population size (U ), measured by the number of registered\nusers;\n\u2022 content size (P ), measured by the number of so-called \u201cgood\u201d\npages, hereafter indifferently called \u201cpages\u201d, \u201cgood pages\u201d\nor \u201carticles\u201d ;\n\u2022 administrator population (A), or the number of users who\nare granted \u201cadministrator status\u201d, i.e. special rights to mod-\nify sensitive content and perform maintenance activity;\n\u2022 editing activity (E), measured by the total number of edits;\nas well as one qualitative variable related to the presence of an op-\ntional access control mechanism:4\n\u2022 editing permission (R), or editing access control, i.e. the pos-\nsibility of creating a page for unregistered\/anonymous users.\nR \u2208 {0, 1}, where 1 \u2261 \u201canonymous editing allowed\u201d.\nThese variables provide simplistic yet key indicators of the global\ndynamics of a wiki, and shed light on diverse aspects of its struc-\nture and evolution. We collected the values of these variables for\neach wiki on a daily basis and over a period of 250 days, i.e. ap-\nproximatively 8 months.\n2.3 Scope restrictions\nPlatform exclusions\nA large number of wikis in the database are based on wikifarms, i.e.\nplatforms hosting several wikis and providing services easing wiki\ncreation and management. Some of these platforms return system-\nwide rather than wiki-specific figures when queried for wiki statis-\ntics, resulting in spurious data. To avoid this, all wikis explicitly\nhosted on platforms exhibiting this behavior (such as wikis hosted\non wikia.com) were excluded from the dataset.\n1It should be noted however that raw content growth per se may not be a good indica-\ntor of a sustainable wiki, as studies on wiki proliferation seem to suggest. [7]\n2This initial dataset includes among others a large set of Wikipedias.\n3Available from http:\/\/s23.org. The database is maintained by a user called\n\u201cMutante\u201d who graciously granted us the permission to automatically harvest this data.\n4This indicator was not part of the original dataset. To obtain this specific information\nwe crawled each wiki in the dataset, at the beginning of the study, using a robot that\nattempted to determine whether page creation was possible without prior user regis-\ntration.\nPopulation range\nIn [10] we observed, on a similar but static dataset, that a large\nmajority of wikis are both thinly populated (i.e. often less than 10\nusers) and\/or do not have a significant number of pages (i.e. gener-\nally less than 10 pages). In the present study, in order to focus on\na relatively homogeneous wiki population, we excluded both wikis\nwith very large populations and those with very few users, so as\nto avoid basing the analysis on data spanning too many orders of\nmagnitude in terms of population. Included in the dataset, there-\nfore, were only wikis whose user population was within the range\n[400, 20 000] on the first day of data collection (note that in this\nregion, content sizes are widely spread, from a few to hundreds of\nthousands of pages).\nGrowth discontinuities\nSome wikis experience abrupt changes of one or even several or-\nders of magnitude in population or content size. There are many\npossible causes of such changes, including spam attacks, and ad-\nministrative decisions to transfer, create, merge or suppress pages\nin bulk or admit or expel classes of user.5 To exclude wikis ex-\nhibiting such a \u201csuspicious\u201d behavior, on the assumption that no\nrecruitment of users or creation of pages of a significant magni-\ntude could \u201cnaturally\u201d happen within a period as short as 24 hours,\na threshold percentage of change \u03b1 between two successive days,\nfor both population and content sizes, was set. Wikis whose daily\ngrowth in either content or users was above the threshold were ex-\ncluded from the dataset. \u03b1 was set to 0.05, i.e. wikis were excluded\nif they had ever experienced more than a 5% increase or decrease\nin users or pages over a period of 24 hours.\nClean dataset\nTo sum up, the final, \u201cclean\u201d dataset is thus made up of about\n360 wikis, all of which have an initial population between 400 and\n20 000 users, are not hosted by \u2018wiki farms\u2019 that do not report use-\nful data, and which have no major discontinuity in the daily change\nof their population or content.\n3. WIKI DYNAMICS\nWe assessed wiki dynamics by comparing their diverse paths with\nrespect to a set of independent variables. \u2018Growth\u2019 is defined in\nterms of population and content size change: user growthGU (resp.\npage growth GP ) is the ratio between final and initial populations\n(resp. content sizes): GU = Ulast\/Ufirst (resp. GP = Plast\/Pfirst).\nWiki dynamics were studied as a function of the variables listed in\nSection 2.2:\n(i) DESCRIPTIVE INDICATORS, i.e. variables on which wiki ad-\nministrators have no direct control: (a) user activity, i.e. the\nproportion of edits per user (E\/U ), (b) user density, i.e. the\nproportion of users per page (U\/P ), and (c) editing density,\ni.e. the proportion of edits per page (E\/P ).\n(ii) GOVERNANCE FACTORS, variables that wiki administrators\ncan directly control: (a) administration ratio, i.e. the propor-\ntion of users who are granted administrator status (A\/U ), (b)\nadministration density, i.e. the proportion of administrators\nper page (A\/P ), (c) editing permission (R).\n5We acknowledge that cases of spam attack are evidence that wiki sustainability is\nalready highly damaged. However, without a method for systematically distinguishing\nthese cases we prefer to leave aside this portion of the dataset for the sake of the present\nanalysis.\nVariable Quantile #1 2 3 4 5\nedits per user [0.14, 3.67[ [3.67, 9.80[ [9.80, 24.8[ [24.8, 61.2[ [61.2, 1903]\nadmins per user [.00169, .00192[ [.00192, .00347[ [.00347, .00576[ [.00576, .01[ [.01, 1.45]\nedits per page [0.12, 9.2[ [9.2, 14.3[ [14.3, 21.8[ [21.8, 35.1[ [35.1, 47 245]\nadmins per page [4.16 \u00b7 10\u22126, .00103[ [.00103, .00309[ [.00309, .00926[ [.00926, .0299[ [.0299, 2.65]\nusers per page [.00119, 0.22[ [.220, .728[ [.728, 2.07[ [2.07, 7.05[ [7.05, 363]\nphase diagram, boundaries: {0.00119497, .116, .307, .619, 1.24, 2.44, 4.99, 12.1, 363}\npopulation quantiles 1 2 3 4\nmean quantiles: [400, 615[ [615, 1075[ [1075, 2407[ [2407, 19909]\nphase diagram, mean boundaries over all \u2018users\/page\u2019 quantiles:{400, 504, 676, 949, 1313, 2162, 3787, 19 909}\nTable 1: Quantile boundaries and sets\nFor each continuous variable, instead of carrying out a delicate\nanalysis by dealing with clouds of points, we adopted a more in-\nsightful approach by dividing wikis into five quantiles, each includ-\ning exactly 20% of all wikis in the clean dataset (see Table 1). We\nthen computed and compared growth ratio means over all wikis for\neach quantile. Additionally, we distinguished population quantiles\nin order to control for user size-related effects. To this end, we\nplotted a growth landscape that consists of a two-dimensional rep-\nresentation of the various growth ratios. This representation was\napplied to all the above-mentioned variables, except for R where\nthere are only two \u201cquantiles\u201d (0 or 1). For each variable except R,\nthe upper graphs indicate the mean values and confidence intervals\n(p < 0.05) of each quantile on the variable considered, while the\nlower graphs show contour plots for the same variable with brighter\nareas corresponding to higher growth ratios.\n1 2 3 4 5\nQuantile of\nedits per user1.0\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\n1.5\n1.6\nGrowth ratio\nUser growth\n1 2 3 4 5\nQuantile of\nedits per user\n0.95\n1.00\n1.05\n1.10\n1.15\n1.20\n1.25\n1.30\nGrowth ratio\nPage growth\n1.1\n1.11.1\n1.2\n1.2\n1.3\n1.3\n1.4\n1.4\n1 2 3 4 5\n1\n2\n3\n4\nQuantiles of 'edits per user'\nPo\npu\nla\ntio\nn\nqu\nan\ntil\nes\nUser growth\n1\n1\n1\n1.1\n1.1\n1.1\n1.1\n1.1\n1.2\n1.2\n1 2 3 4 5\n1\n2\n3\n4\nQuantiles of 'edits per user'\nPo\npu\nla\ntio\nn\nqu\nan\ntil\nes\nPage growth\nFigure 1: Growth landscape with respect to the proportion of\nedits per user\n3.1 Significant descriptive indicators\nWe found significant correlations between a number of descriptive\nindicators of wiki structure and their content and population growth\nrates. Figure 1 shows the effect of user activity (measured as the\nproportion of edits per user) on growth rates. The results suggest\nthat user activity correlates very strongly with wiki growth, not only\nin terms of content production (which is to a certain extent unsur-\nprising) but also new member recruitment. The effect becomes\nstronger with initially more populated wikis: the more users are\nactively editing, the more a wiki grows in content and population.\nFigure 2 shows the impact of user density on growth. The results\nsuggest that a higher number of contributors per page does not nec-\nessarily indicate mushrooming wikis: for an identical content size,\nwe found a significant correlation between a lower number of users\nand higher growth ratios, both in content and new members.\n1 2 3 4 5\nQuantile of\nusers per good page1.0\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\n1.5\n1.6\nGrowth ratio\nUser growth\n1 2 3 4 5\nQuantile of\nusers per good page1.00\n1.05\n1.10\n1.15\n1.20\n1.25\n1.30\nGrowth ratio\nPage growth\n1\n1.1\n1.1\n1.2\n1.2\n1.3\n1.3\n1.41.4 1.5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1\n2\n3\n4\nQuantiles of 'users per good page'\nPo\npu\nla\ntio\nn\nqu\nan\ntil\nes\nUser growth\n1\n1\n1\n1.1\n1.1\n1.1\n1.1\n1.2\n1 2 3 4 5\n1\n2\n3\n4\nQuantiles of 'users per good page'\nPo\npu\nla\ntio\nn\nqu\nan\ntil\nes\nPage growth\nFigure 2: Growth landscape with respect to the proportion of\nusers per good page\nTo better visualize the effect of user density on growth, we rep-\nresented the dependent variables GU and GP , independent vari-\nable U\/P , and initial wiki positions Ufirst and Pfirst altogether on\nthe same graph, yielding a phase diagram as plotted on Fig. 3.6 In\nthis diagram, each dot (light color) corresponds to a wiki in the\ndatabase. Each arrow corresponds to a pair of quantiles \u201cusers per\npage, population\u201d. Widths and heights are proportional to user and\ncontent growth ratios, respectively. The size of the arrow represents\nthe strength of the observed growth in content and population for\nwikis in a given region of the wikisphere.\nThis graph should be regarded as a map of a portion of the wiki-\nsphere, showing the expected destiny of a wiki in terms of content\nand population growth as a function of its initial position in the\nsame space. This diagram broadly suggests that a wiki\u2019s position\nis correlated with its subsequent fate. More precisely, it illustrates\nthat wikis in the upper\/upper-right portion of the diagram are grow-\ning faster, and more interestingly it provides an overview of demo-\ngraphic dynamics in this region of the wikisphere.\n3.2 Effective governance factors\nTurning to governance features, we first analyzed the effects of\nthe administrator population on wiki dynamics by looking at the\noverall proportion of administrators per page.\nFigure 4 shows that having a relatively high number of adminis-\ntrators for a given content size is likely to reduce growth. There is a\nstrong effect of the proportion of admins per page both on user and\npage growth. For instance, while the last quantile of admins\/page\nratio enjoys near-zero growth rates over 8 months, the first quantile\ntops overall rates (\u223c+50% for users, \u223c+25% for pages).

As a binary variable, the editing permission vari-\nable generates only two groups of wikis (wikis that allow anony-\nmous editing versus wikis that restrict editing to registered users\nonly). The growth landscape is consequently limited to a one-\ndimensional comparison over population quantiles. The results in\nFigure 5 show that for both dimensions\u2014population and content\u2014\nhaving no access control is likely to favour growth. While a stronger\npage growth is quite unsurprising in wikis where no registration is\nrequired, the fact that this factor also fuels user registration is more\n1 2 3 4 5\nQuantile of\nadmins per good page1.0\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\n1.5\n1.6\nGrowth ratio\nUser growth\n1 2 3 4 5\nQuantile of\nadmins per good page\n0.95\n1.00\n1.05\n1.10\n1.15\n1.20\n1.25\n1.30\nGrowth ratio\nPage growth\n1.1\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.3\n1.4\n1 2 3 4 5\n1\n2\n3\n4\nQuantiles of 'admins per good page'\nPo\npu\nla\ntio\nn\nqu\nan\ntil\nes\nUser growth\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1.1\n1.1\n1.1\n1.1\n1.2\n1 2 3 4 5\n1\n2\n3\n4\nQuantiles of 'admins per good page'\nPo\npu\nla\ntio\nn\nqu\nan\ntil\nes\nPage growth\nFigure 4: Growth landscape with respect to the proportion of\nadmins per good page\n1 2 3 4\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\n1.5\nPopulation quantiles\nG\nro\nw\nth\nra\nte\nUser growth\n1 2 3 4\n1.00\n1.05\n1.10\n1.15\n1.20\n1.25\n1.30\n1.35\n1.40\nPopulation quantiles\nG\nro\nw\nth\nra\nte\nPage growth\nFigure 5: Growth landscape with respect to editing permission:\nred dashed refers to anonymously editable wikis, blue solid to\nwikis editable by registered users only\npuzzling: one might think that if users can participate without reg-\nistration, few would be inclined to register.

CONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe main contribution of this study is an overview of which indica-\ntors wiki communities should take into account in order to control\ntheir demographics, by paying specific attention to some variables\nand consider acting upon them when possible, while neglecting\nothers. In this respect, we drew attention to the remarkable dy-\nnamical intertwinement of population and content growth, which\nsuggests that models of wiki dynamics will probably need to focus\non the strong interrelations between these two variables.\nRepresenting the impact of specific variables via phase diagrams\ncan be a valuable solution for wiki administrators for monitoring\npurposes and for social scientists as a first step towards modeling.\nHowever, in order to develop more accurate models of wiki dy-\nnamics, richer datasets with more detailed indicators and platform-\nindependent data collection tools need to be developed. In order\nto make the data tractable for this initial analysis, we restricted the\ndataset in several ways and a more comprehensive study, beyond\nthe scope of the present paper, should endeavor to investigate a\nlarger spectrum of wiki-based communities.\n5.
