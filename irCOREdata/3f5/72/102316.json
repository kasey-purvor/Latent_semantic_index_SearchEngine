De-\nsign rules that must be imposed on the geometry of optical waveg-\nuides to make them behave as polarization-independent and single-\nmode devices are well known for waveguides with relatively large\ncross sections and for some small cross-sectional rib waveguides\nwith vertical sidewalls and an air top cladding. The influence of the\ntop oxide cover on waveguide birefringence was analyzed recently,\nbut only for relatively large cross-sectional waveguides. This paper\nreports simulations for both single-mode and polarization-inde-\npendent behavior for small cross-sectional waveguides with vari-\nable rib width, etch depth, top oxide cover thickness, and side-\nwall angle. The results show that the stress-induced effects must\nbe taken into account to satisfy both requirements.

INTRODUCTION\nR ECENT years have seen an enormous interest in in-creased functionality and cost-effective fabrication of\nsmaller silicon photonic devices. An optical waveguide, built\nin the most promising silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform, rep-\nresents the basic building component in many optical systems,\nsuch as arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs), resonators, modu-\nlators, lasers, and tunable systems. High-index contrast between\nthe cladding and waveguide core facilitates the optical mode\nconfinement and guiding of light. Typical wavelengths for SOI\napplications are 1.31 and 1.55 m, but longer wavelengths are\nnot suitable (except in the 3\u20133.5- m range) due to absorption\nspectra of silicon dioxide [1].

Such waveguides are usually\nundesirable in photonic circuits as their operation can be seri-\nously compromised by the presence of multiple modes. It has\nbeen shown, however, that large rib waveguides in SOI could\nbe designed to be monomodal [9]. These waveguides have\nbeen studied extensively by a number of researchers [10]\u2013[13]\nto find single-mode behavior and low-loss propagation. Large\nrib waveguides are interesting because they are multimicron in\ncross-sectional dimensions (of the order of 5 m) facilitating\nlow-loss coupling to and from optical fibres. Soref et al. [9] first\nproposed a simple expression for the single-mode condition\n(SMC) of such waveguides\nfor (1)\nwhere is the ratio of slab height to overall rib height,\nand is the ratio of waveguide width to overall rib height\n(Fig. 1). Their analysis of the waveguides was limited to shallow\netched ribs ( ) and the waveguide dimensions were as-\nsumed to be larger than the operating wavelength. The analysis\nwas based on the assumption that higher order vertical modes\n(i.e., modes other than the fundamental mode) confined under\nthe rib, were coupled to the outer slab region during propagation,\ntherefore yielding high propagation losses for the higher order\nmodes. Thus, the waveguides behave as single-mode waveg-\nuides, as all other modes are lost. Chan et al. [14] produced\nequations to predict single mode and polarization independence\nfor relatively small rib waveguides\nfor and (2)\n(3)\nEquation (2) defines the quasi-TM (transverse magnetic) single-\nmode boundary, and hence provides guidance on the geomet-\nrical limitations to retain single-mode behavior, while (3) de-\nfines the minimum etch depth required to obtain polariza-\n0733-8724\/$25.00 \u00a9 2008 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The guidelines of (2) and (3) are for waveg-\nuides with an air top cladding. However, an upper cladding layer\nis often deposited to reduce the influence of surface contami-\nnation, to passivate the surface, or to provide electrical isola-\ntion. For the SOI platform, this layer is usually SiO (Fig. 1),\nalthough nitride and polymer layers are also used in some cases.\nTherefore, the single-mode and birefringence-free conditions\nalso need to be determined for such a cladding, not only be-\ncause oxide cladding has a different refractive index than air, but\nalso because it causes stress in the waveguide structure therefore\nchanging effective refractive indexes for (transverse electric) TE\nand TM polarizations. Recent simulations have shown that the\nsingle-mode\/multimode boundary for TM polarization is below\nthe TE boundary and the following equation for the multimode\nboundary was given [15]:\n(4)\nThis equation is more strict than (2), but it is based on an\nisotropic distribution of material refractive index and is valid\nonly for waveguides with a large top oxide layer ( 1 m)\nand vertical waveguide sidewall angle. In this paper, we analyze\nthe difference between isotropic and anisotropic cases. The\ninfluence of a thinner oxide cover and waveguide sidewall angle\nis also discussed.\nIn many applications, it is important to achieve small modal\nbirefringence, defined here as the difference between the ef-\nfective indexes of the two orthogonally polarized modes, the\nhorizontally polarized mode (quasi-TE) and the vertically po-\nlarized mode (quasi-TM) . To achieve\nzero birefringence (ZBR) in rib waveguides, an optimization of\nwaveguide dimensions is necessary [16]\u2013[18]. As we are inves-\ntigating a most common situation where there is an oxide upper\ncladding, the total birefringence is, however, the sum of the ge-\nometrical birefringence and stress-induced birefringence [16].\nThe structure we analyze in this paper, at the operating wave-\nlength of 1.55 m, is a rib waveguide with the height of\n1.35 m, and variable waveguide rib width , etch depth\n, top oxide cover thickness , and sidewall angle , as shown\nin Fig. 1. The buried oxide (BOX) layer is 1 m in thickness,\nwhile the top oxide cladding in performed simulations is 0.1\u20133\nm thick. These waveguide dimensions are chosen as we have\npreviously reported optical filters based on such waveguide [19],\n[20]. The strain in the upper SiO layer produces a stress distri-\nbution within and near the Si rib, which in turn causes a change\nof the refractive index in both materials due to the photoelastic\neffect. During the simulations, we used the fact that the thick-\nness of the upper cladding film on the rib sidewalls is 70% of that\non the top, a result obtained by a scanning electron microscope\n(SEM) investigation of the fabricated rib waveguides. In this\npaper, we present the effect of stress on the multimode boundary\nand the effect of stress on the polarization independence curve.\nThe simulations were performed by using a 2-D finite element\nmethod (FEM) modeling [21]\u2013[23] and verified by 3-D semi-\nand full-vectorial beam propagation method (BPM) [24]. The\nmethod we used was to calculate the effective indexes for the\nfundamental and the first two higher order modes, for both po-\nlarizations, over a range of waveguide dimensions.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the stress\ntheory and the stress influence on the total birefringence are pre-\nsented. The polarization-independent surface and the influence\nof the waveguide sidewall angle is also explained. The single-\nmode behavior with and without taking into account stress-in-\nduced effects is given in Section III. The concluding remarks\nare summarized in Section IV.\nII. WAVEGUIDE STRESS THEORY AND\nPOLARIZATION-INDEPENDENT SURFACE\nThe stress causes birefringence [25], which may in turn in-\nduce polarization conversion and polarization-dependent loss.\nThe change in the material effective indexes caused by stress-in-\nduced effects can be expressed as [26]\u2013[30]\n(5)\nwhere , , and are the principal components of the\nrelative stress tensor, and are the components of the\nmaterial\u2019s refractive index, is the refractive index without\nstress, and and are the stress-optic constants related\nto the Young\u2019s modulus , Poisson\u2019s ratio , and the\nphotoelastic tensor elements ( and ) as\n(6)\nOne source of birefringence is strain due to the temperature dif-\nference before and after fabrication processes.

Calculation window size was chosen to be large enough\nto minimize the influence of the edge effects on the stress distri-\nbution in the vicinity of the rib waveguide. Because of the sharp\nwaveguide corners stress is inhomogeneous and anisotropic\n[17]. Due to the fabrication processes where the silicon core\nis covered by the silica cladding layer at high temperature,\nthe difference between the operating (20 C) and reference\n(1000 C) temperatures is assumed to be 980 K [16].\nThe stress field in the waveguide and Maxwell\u2019s equations are\nsolved by FEM, on a nonuniform mesh of triangular elements\n[21]. For our numerical computations, approximately 40 000\nelements and the higher order shape functions of the Lagrange\ntype were used.\nThe modal birefringence was evaluated for different rib\nwaveguide geometries and top oxide cover thicknesses in the\n0.1\u20133- m range. The waveguide height was fixed at\n1.35 m. First, we calculated the stress distribution and corre-\nsponding distribution of the refractive index in the waveguide.\nThen, Maxwell\u2019s equations were solved and effective indexes\nfor both quasi-TE and quasi-TM modes were obtained from the\neigenvalues [17], [18].\nFig. 2(a)\u2013(c) represents the influence of waveguide rib width\non the waveguide birefringence for a given value of the etch\ndepth. We assumed vertical rib sidewalls and for a given top\noxide thickness, for each etch depth, a series of points\nwere calculated. The results show that for smaller etch depths\n( 0.7 m) the birefringence is always positive, i.e., quasi-TE\nand quasi-TM polarizations cannot be equalized by changing\nvalues of waveguide width and top oxide cover. Deeper etched\ndevices, on the contrary, show a tendency for two specific\nwaveguide widths for which the ZBR condition is fulfilled.\nThis means that by using stress it is possible to produce bire-\nfringence-free waveguides for two different waveguide widths\nwhen a deeper etch depth is employed. The increase of the\nFig. 2.

For larger , the family of\ncurves becomes deeper and wider.\nThe ZBR curves for different values of top oxide cover thick-\nness as a function of waveguide rib width and etch depth is pre-\nsented in Fig. 3. It can be noticed that the increase of the top\noxide cover thickness shifts the ZBR curves to smaller values of\nthe etch depth, which is consistent with the results from Fig. 2.\nAlso, considering constant etch depth, the zero-birefringence\ncondition (ZBC) can be achieved for higher values of , while\nthe lower value of is \u201csaturated.\u201d For the upper part of the\nZBR curves, that is for wider ribs, when increasing the oxide\nthickness the birefringence will become negative and therefore\nto make it zero again, the width of the rib needs to be increased\nin order to reduce the stress influence on the rib.

ZBC as a function of waveguide rib width and etch depth for different\nvalues of top oxide thickness.\nribs, the mode resides mainly in the slab region and therefore\nthe increase of the oxide thickness will not affect the birefrin-\ngence significantly, hence the saturation in that region. The in-\nfluence and importance of using stress engineering is obvious.\nThe parabolas move to the left in respect to the ZBC curve for a\nrib waveguide with an air cover ( ). At large top oxide thick-\nnesses ( 0.8 m) a saturation of ZBR curves is observed.\nIf we now calculate ZBR points for each value of upper oxide\nthickness for each etch depth and corresponding waveguide rib\nwidth value, it is possible to draw the ZBR surface (Fig. 4). At\nthe beginning ( ), the surface has parabolic shape, which\nbecomes wider for larger values of . Finally, it is saturated for\n0.8 m and smaller . We can observe that there is a min-\nimum etch depth ( ) for each waveguide design, which has\nto be matched if the ZBC needs to be met.

In other\nwords, the effective width of the rib will increase, and therefore\nfor constant oxide thickness, the ZBC will not be fulfilled. To\nobtain , the effective rib width need to be decreased,\nwhich means that the ZBC will be fulfilled for narrower ribs.\nFig. 4.

We can conclude that the stress-induced\nbirefringence for shallow etched rib waveguides has less influ-\nence on the total birefringence. Geometrical birefringence is\nthen dominant and that is why the ZBR curve moves to the right,\nsimilar to the case when stress effects are not considered. Fabri-\ncated waveguides typically have sidewall angles in the 8 \u201310\nrange. In that case, the ZBR curve moves down maintaining the\nvalues of etch depth. If we assume this range of the sidewall an-\ngles, the following equation describes the influence of the side-\nwall to the waveguide width which maintains the ZBC:\nThis equation is complementary to the previous equations and\nthey all together [(9)\u2013(12)] give conditions for waveguide pa-\nrameters that have to be matched to satisfy ZBC. As it can be\nseen, a careful design of waveguides need to be carried out prior\nto the fabrication to achieve polarization independence.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

SATISFYING BOTH SINGLE-MODE AND\nPOLARIZATION-INDEPENDENCE CONDITIONS\nThe modal analysis of relatively small cross-sectional rib\nwaveguides was performed by FEM simulations [21]\u2013[23].\nMaxwell\u2019s equations are solved in the two different cases,\nisotropic and anisotropic, due to stress-induced changes in\nmaterial refractive indexes. The isotropic case is also solved\nvia a full-vectorial BPM algorithm [24] to verify the FEM\nsimulations. The incident field was chosen to be Gaussian\nbeam lunched off-center with appropriate parameters that\nallowed excitation of higher order modes (modes other than\nthe fundamental mode). To provide sufficient accuracy of FEM\nsimulations with BPM, we used a correlation method [14] and\ncalculated the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the correlation\nfunction. This result can also be achieved by calculating the\neffective mode indexes using semivectorial BPM [33]. How-\never, in this study, FEM simulations were used because they\ncan easily incorporate the change in material refractive index\ncaused by stress from the upper oxide layer via the photoelastic\neffect.\nSimilar to the calculation of the ZBR curves, for a given\noxide thickness and sidewall angle, a number of single mode\n\u201cquasi-TE\u201d and \u201cquasi-TM\u201d points were found in the wave-\nguide width\/etch depth plane. We focused on one specific value\nfor etch depth and changed the waveguide rib width until the\nfirst higher order mode was found. This was done for a given\nvalue of waveguide sidewall angle and top oxide layer thick-\nness. Field profile is strongly dependent on waveguide geom-\netry and in some cases we found that the more critical higher\norder mode was the quasi-TM mode, while in other cases\nquasi-TM mode was more critical. In common with our pre-\nvious work (without stress-induced effects) [14], [33], we also\nfound that satisfying the SMC for the TM mode is again more\nrestrictive than for the TE mode. The area below the SMC for\nquasi-TM mode defines the global condition for the single-mode\nbehavior. According to our simulations, for a given waveguide\nparameters, there is at least one intersection point between the\nSMC line for quasi-TM mode and the ZBR curve. A part of the\nZBR parabola between these intersection points defines wave-\nguide parameters for which both ZBC and SMC are satisfied.\nFig. 6 shows two different cases of the waveguide with ver-\ntical sidewalls. The first [Fig. 6(a)] is the waveguide without an\nupper oxide layer, while the second [Fig. 6(b)] represents the\nwaveguide with an upper oxide cover of 0.3 m in thick-\nness. In the first case [Fig. 6(a)], the same result as in [14] was\nobtained, as expected. Both the SMC and ZBC are satisfied and\nthe quasi-TM curve is more critical for the single-mode\/multi-\nmode boundary. In the case when an oxide layer is deposited,\nthe situation is different [Fig. 6(b)]. As mentioned previously,\nthe ZBR curve moves to the left, but the single-mode curves are\nalso changed. The single mode quasi-TM curve is again the one\nthat will limit the boundary between the single-mode and mul-\ntimode behavior, but the stress effect will shift the quasi-TE and\nquasi-TM curve down. Now, we have very limited locus where\nboth SMC and ZBC can be matched.\nFig. 7 shows the SM and ZBR curves in the case when a thick\noxide layer is deposited onto the waveguide. Fig. 7(a) represents\nFig. 6. Single-mode and zero birefringence condition as a function of wave-\nguide rib width and etch depth for top oxide thickness of (a) \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 and (b) \u0000 \u0002\n0.3 \u0002m (\u0003 \u0002 90 ).\nthe waveguide with vertical sidewalls ( 90 ), while Fig. 7(b)\nis for the waveguide with slanted sidewalls ( 80 ). In both\nfigures we present only the quasi-TM mode curves because they\ndefine conditions for single-mode behavior. Two cases were\nanalyzed. One is for the isotropic refractive index of material,\nwhile the other takes into account the stress-induced effects that\nproduce anisotropic refractive index distribution in the material.\nThere are three important things that can be seen in Fig. 7(a).\nFirst, there is a big difference between the ZBR curves. As it can\nbe seen, the stress-induced birefringence must be taken into ac-\ncount. The ZBR curves moves to the left with respect to the ZBR\ncurve that was calculated in the isotropic case. Hence, there are\nmore choices for waveguide dimensions that allow polarization\nindependence. Second, the single-mode calculation is very im-\nportant. If the stress effects are taken into account, the curve is\nslightly different from the one that represents the isotropic case.\nHere, stress influence is higher for smaller values of etch depth,\nwhile for deeper etch depths we obtained similar results as in\nthe isotropic case. Third, the most important thing is that we\nfound the locus where both SM and ZBR conditions are ful-\nfilled. In the isotropic case, the ZBR and SM curves are not\nclose to each other. If we consider the ZBR curve calculated by\nusing stress-induced effects and quasi-TM curve calculated in\nthe isotropic case, we find that the curves are much closer, but\nagain both SM and ZBR conditions cannot be satisfied.

In many ways, this is for-\ntuitous result, as it means the stress allows us to fabricate small\nwaveguides that satisfy both the SM and ZBR conditions.\nFig. 7(b) represents a similar situation as Fig. 7(a), but for\na waveguide with the slanted sidewalls of 80 [17], [33]. The\nZBR and SM curves are again different. The sidewall angle in-\nfluences the position of SM curves such that the curve that is\ncalculated using anisotropic distribution of the refractive index\nis slightly below the curve calculated in the isotropic case, which\nis different from the situation in Fig. 7(a). In the isotropic case, a\nrelatively short locus that satisfies both SMC and ZBC is found,\nwhile in the anisotropic case, the desired locus is larger. It is\nalso worth noting that the two SM curves are closer to each\nother for deeper ribs when 90 while the opposite is the\ncase when 80 . When the sidewall angle decreases, for\na certain top rib width bottom rib width increases. Also, if\nthe waveguide etch depth increases, for constant and ,\nbottom rib width will increase. In both cases the effective wave-\nguide width increases and consequently the field confinement in\nthe rib. For vertical sidewalls and ribs with large values of ,\nthe mode will reside mainly in the slab, and therefore, the influ-\nence of the oxide is not significant. Hence, the two SM curves in\nFig. 7(a) are similar for deeper ribs. If the sidewalls are slanted,\nthen the difference between the top rib width and the bottom\n(and also effective) rib width increases with an increase in etch\ndepth. Therefore, the influence of the oxide stress increases and\nhence the difference between the two SM curves in Fig. 7(b) in-\ncreases for larger .\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, the design rules that satisfy both single-mode\nand polarization-independent operation for relatively small\ncross-sectional SOI rib waveguides have been presented. We\nhave examined waveguides with different sidewall angle, top\noxide cover thickness, variable waveguide rib width, and etch\ndepth. The stress effects induced by the upper oxide were\ndiscussed and compared with the isotropic case. When the\ntop oxide increases in thickness, the single-mode\/multimode\nboundary is shifted down to lower values of rib widths, com-\npared to the case with an air cladding thickness. The zero\nbirefringence curves moves to smaller values of etch depth and\n\u201csaturate\u201d for larger values of top oxide cover ( 0.8 m).\nThe ZBR surface is also given to provide the wide range of\nwaveguide dimensions that satisfy the ZBC. It has been shown\nthat by stress engineering, ZBR can be achieved for a wave-\nguide that has otherwise relatively large birefringence. In order\nto achieve both single-mode and polarization-independent\ncondition, a careful design must be carried out using stress\nengineering tools, together with the waveguide geometry.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.
