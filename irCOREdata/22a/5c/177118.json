Unlike other medical areas, the randomised controlled trial\n(RCT) design has not become the default study design for the evaluation of surgical interventions.\nSurgical trials are difficult to successfully undertake and pose particular practical and\nmethodological challenges. However, RCTs have played a role in the assessment of surgical\ninnovations and there is scope and need for greater use. This article will consider the design,\nconduct and analysis of an RCT of a surgical intervention. The issues will be reviewed under three\nheadings: the timing of the evaluation, defining the research question and trial design issues.\nRecommendations on the conduct of future surgical RCTs are made. Collaboration between\nresearch and surgical communities is needed to address the distinct issues raised by the assessment\nof surgical interventions and enable the conduct of appropriate and well-designed trials.\nBackground\nThe promotion of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to\nevaluate surgical interventions was once colourfully sug-\ngested to be the 'fifth horseman of an apocalyptical surgi-\ncal fundamentalism' [1]. While the value of the RCT\ndesign has been more readily accepted by others, it has\nnot become the default study design for the evaluation of\nnew surgical interventions [2-4]. This article will consider\nthe challenges to successfully conducting an RCT evalua-\ntion of a surgical intervention. Surgical interventions can\nbe defined as those which involve physically changing\nbody tissues and organs through manual operation such\nas cutting, abrading, suturing or the use of lasers. It should\nbe noted that some authors use a wider definition of sur-\ngical trials [3] which includes trials in a surgical context,\nwhere surgery is involved but is not one of the interven-\ntions under evaluation, for example a placebo-controlled\ntrial of ibuprofen for pain and disability relief after hip\nreplacement surgery [5]. While many of the issues raised\nbelow have relevance for such trials, they have been much\nmore readily conducted and do not face the same chal-\nlenges.\nSince the epochal streptomycin trial in the 1940s, the RCT\ndesign has been applied widely [6]. As understanding of\nthe nature of study design and of the influence of bias has\ngrown, the RCT design has for many become the 'gold\nstandard' of evaluation, the standard against which others\nare compared. Through random allocation of partici-\npants, equally distributed groups are formed in a RCT.\nThis allows for any difference between treatment groups\nto be confidently inferred to be due to the treatments\nthemselves and not any other factor, known or unknown\nto be related to outcome. Where equipoise exists, it can be\nargued from an ethical point of view that every participant\nis guaranteed a (random) chance of receiving the best\nPublished: 6 February 2009\nTrials 2009, 10:9 doi:10.1186\/1745-6215-10-9\nReceived: 12 September 2008\nAccepted: 6 February 2009\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/10\/1\/9\n\u00a9 2009 Cook; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2009, 10:9 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/10\/1\/9treatment. With the requirements of regulatory bodies\nsuch as the Food and Drug Administration in the USA, the\nRCT has been not only expected but mandated in the\npharmaceutical area. Through the strong promotion of\nChalmers amongst others [7] and the evidence-based\nmedicine movement in general, it is common for new\ninterventions to be evaluated in an RCT context. While\nrecognising RCTs as the 'gold standard', it has been sug-\ngested that the design has a more limited role in assessing\nsurgery than for drug interventions [2,8,9]. However, find-\nings from alternative (non-randomised) study designs\ncannot be given the same confidence, due to the substan-\ntial risk of the introduction of bias. Comparisons of ran-\ndomised and non-randomised studies have shown that\nthe results can be divergent, in direction as well as magni-\ntude [10]. While many surgeons accept the need in princi-\nple for RCTs, they struggle to reconcile their personal\ninvolvement with their surgical experience.\nRandomised comparisons of surgical interventions have\nbeen performed for many years [7]. A number of surgical\ninterventions have been shown to be ineffective and later\ndiscarded, in some cases following randomised compari-\nsons [11]. Internal mammary artery ligation was a popu-\nlar surgical procedure until two small RCTs, some 20 years\nafter the intervention was proposed, reported no benefit\nover placebo surgery. There is, however, some evidence\nthat the growth in the number of RCTs being conducted\nin surgery has stagnated and fallen behind other clinical\nareas [8,12]. A review of one surgical journal found an\nincrease in the number of RCTs from 1990 to 2000 [13].\nHowever, only 3.4% of all articles in leading surgical jour-\nnals were RCTs [14]. Furthermore, of the RCTs published\nin these journals during a ten-year period, less than one\nhalf of the RCTs were a randomised comparison of a sur-\ngical intervention against an alternative. The contrast with\nother areas can be seen by comparing audits of the evi-\ndence base for clinical practice in internal medicine and\nseveral surgical specialties. Whereas one half of interven-\ntions in internal medicine were judged to be based upon\nevidence from RCTs, two surgery audits reported a quarter\nor less [15-17].\nWhile there are genuine challenges to conducting surgical\ntrials, concerns about the quality of surgical trials are often\nmore general and more readily addressable. Reviews of\nurological and orthopaedic trauma trials, which recog-\nnised the difficulties inherent in conducting surgical trials,\nfound poor compliance with the consort statement for\nreporting RCTs, echoing the findings of an earlier review,\nand may reflect generally poorer trial methodology [18-\n20]. A lack of understanding about RCTs in surgical com-\nmunities and the need for better epidemiological and sta-\ntistical training of surgeons have been noted [3,21].\nHistorical and ethos-related reasons as to why the surgical\ncommunity has been slow to change have been suggested\n[4].\nThe difficulties of conducting an RCT of a surgical inter-\nvention have long been recognised [21-25]. Surgical RCTs\nmay have suffered as understanding of bias has grown, as\nthe maximum safeguards against bias are difficult to\nachieve, particularly compared with pure pharmaceutical\ntreatments. A review of surgical operative questions in the\ngastrointestinal specialty suggested that while there was,\nat least in principle, substantially more scope for RCTs,\nthere were many questions where an RCT was judged not\nto be feasible [26]. A number of barriers to conducting\nsurgical RCTs have been suggested [2,3,9,27,28]. Stirrat\nand colleagues produced a helpful summary of the issues\ninvolved and some suggestions to overcome them [9].\nMore recently, two other groups have done similarly\n[3,28]. An overview of the issues and possible solutions\nwill be reviewed under three headings: the timing of the\nevaluation, defining the research question and trial design\nissues. It should be noted that a systematic review and cor-\nresponding meta-analysis can play an invaluable role in\ntrial design.\nBroadly, surgical trials can be classified into three generic\ntypes: exploratory, explanatory and pragmatic trials.\nExploratory trials allow early assessment of new interven-\ntions. An explanatory trial seeks to assess whether the\nintervention can work under favourable conditions. In\ncontrast, a pragmatic trial seeks to inform clinical decision\nmaking by evaluating an intervention in a realistic clinical\nsetting. General characteristics of the three types are\nshown in Table 1, though in practice a trial may have\nsome characteristics that reflect more than one type or\nwhich defy easy categorisation. In particular, a continuum\nbetween explanatory and pragmatic trials exists [29]. It\nshould be noted that the evaluation of surgery, by its com-\nplex nature, naturally fits a more pragmatic framework. By\nadopting a generally pragmatic approach, the impact of\nmany of the trial design issues is diluted. For example,\nlegitimate variations in surgical\/centre practice or some\npatients not receiving surgery as initially planned can be\nincorporated into the evaluation, as opposed to attempt-\ning to preclude them from occurring. Such an approach\nevaluates a realistic management strategy involving the\nsurgical intervention. As a consequence, the findings from\na trial with this approach will be more widely applicable.\nThe timing of the evaluation\nWhen to assess?\nUnlike the four phases of clinical trials which map out the\nevaluation of pharmaceutical interventions, the evalua-\ntion of surgical interventions has been sporadic, with the\ntiming or existence of a randomised evaluation uncertain.\nThe absence of a strong regulatory framework has resultedPage 2 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2009, 10:9 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/10\/1\/9in the proliferation of surgical innovation on the basis of\nlimited and weak scientific evidence [3,30,31]. The classic\nexample of recent times has been the case of laparoscopic\ncholecystectomy, where adoption was rapid, uncontrolled\nand haphazard. RCT evaluation occurred late, after much\nof the surgical community had already become convinced\nof the worth of the technique [3,31]. Little, if any, ran-\ndomised evidence is usually available upon which to base\nrecommendations on safety and efficacy for new interven-\ntional (including surgical) interventions [32]. Most surgi-\ncal RCTs, as was the case for laparoscopic\ncholecystectomy, are akin to phase III pharmaceutical tri-\nals.\nHowever, there is a role for early and appropriate RCTs to\nallow rigorous and timely assessment. Indeed, in Chalm-\ners' seminal work on randomisation from the first patient,\nhe used a surgical example where randomisation from the\nfirst handful of cases was undertaken [7]. Chalmers\nargued strongly for early RCT assessment of surgical inno-\nvations, arguing from ethical reasoning of guaranteeing a\npatient's right to a (random) chance of receiving the best\ntreatment and also from the difficulty of fully informing\npatients in the early cases of development [22]. Others\nargue the need for a non-randomised study in a develop-\nmental phase due to procedural refinement and associ-\nated learning effects [2,3]. However, the complementary\nvalue of an early and later randomised comparison has\nbeen highlighted [33]. An early evaluation could take the\nform of an exploratory trial. Tracker trials have been pro-\nposed as a flexible framework which encompasses the dif-\nferent stages of evaluating a new intervention in a single\nstudy. Under such an approach, randomisation can take\nplace early, with procedural refinements and new inter-\nvention options incorporated into the study by allowing\nchanges in the randomisation strategy. These develop-\nments are 'tracked' and assessed in subsequent statistical\nanalyses [34]. Once the technology and treatment options\nhave stabilised, a conventional phase III RCT could be\nmounted within this framework as a continuation of the\ntracker trial. The UK Endovascular Aneurysm Repair trials\nadopted some features of this concept [28]. Despite the\nscientific merits of such a comprehensive approach, to\ndate no fully fledged tracker trials have been undertaken.\nThe difficult balancing act of waiting until development\nhas settled, where early results can lead to the loss of equi-\npoise, has long been recognised [7]. The challenge has\nbeen distilled into what has become known as Buxton's\nlaw: 'It is always too early [for rigorous evaluation] until\nsuddenly it's too late' [35]. Large surgical trials, once\nmajor technology has stabilised, have become more com-\nmon where equipoise still exists. Such trials will be\ndependent on the persistence of equipoise (patient and\nsurgeon) and may fail to recruit as hoped [2]. Commercial\ninfluences can come into play. In general, early and rigor-\nous randomised evaluation would seem to be the excep-\ntion rather than the rule.\nFunding\nAn important driver of the timing of an evaluation has\nbeen availability of funding. Anecdotally it has been sug-\ngested that surgical trials are often unfairly compared with\nthe expectation of a drug trial, and if a 'double-blind' pla-\ncebo-controlled study is the standard to which it is held,\nthen a surgical trial will often be considered inferior. In\ncontrast to pharmaceutical treatments, there is generally\nlittle commercial incentive for a company to fund ran-\ndomised surgical trials. The need for national funding\nbodies to cater for surgical trials and explicitly recognise\nthe challenges has been noted [3]. A review of applica-\ntions to the National Institutes of Health in the USA\nshowed that though surgical applications had grown over\nthe last 20 years it was at a lower rate than the overall\nincrease. The surgical success rate was also slightly lower\n[36].

While sufficient funding for rigorous\nrandomised evaluation of every surgical innovation may\nnot be realistic [4], major innovations should be subject\nto rigorous evaluation and appropriate funding is needed.\nDefining the Research Question\nChoice of comparator\nIn defining the research question, the most important\ndecision is the choice of comparator. Sometimes surgical\nintervention may be the only curative treatment. Compar-\nison of surgery against no active treatment or watchful\nwaiting may be appropriate where the condition is not\nacute. The possibility of using placebo surgery will be con-\nsidered later. A key consideration will be the ability to\nrecruit; this has been noted as being difficult, particularly\nfor medical versus surgical comparisons [9,37,38]. A\nnumber of variations in randomisation strategies have\nbeen adopted to combat the difficulty in recruiting sur-\ngeons and participants. Traditionally, a randomised trial\nwill involve the randomisation between two treatments\nwhereby the randomised treatment will be administered\nby the same clinician. Where the treatments are from dif-\nferent clinical specialties, such as medical versus surgical\ntrials, this will not be case. However, where two surgical\ntreatments are being compared, it has been common for\nboth interventions to be performed by participating sur-\ngeons. If the difference between interventions is minor,\nthis may not be difficult to achieve. However, where dif-\nferences are more pronounced this can be problematic, as\nsurgeons may routinely only perform one or the other\nintervention. Additionally, while the surgical community\ncan be in equipoise, individual surgeons may have strong\npreferences. In light of these concerns, the use of expertise-\nbased randomised trials has been proposed as an alterna-\ntive design, where participants are randomised to sur-\ngeons with expertise in the allocated intervention [25,39].\nWhile some surgeons may perform both interventions,\nthere is no requirement to do so. Where expertise for both\nsurgical interventions is available in a centre, this would\nseem a convenient solution. However, in a multicentre\ntrial, if some centres only have expertise in one interven-\ntion, centre differences could lead to bias. More generally,\nan expertise-based trial may not necessarily produce a\nresult generalisable to the whole surgical community, due\nto the make up of the participating surgeons and centres.\nPatient preferences are likely to be prominent when the\ntreatments differ greatly, for example in medical versus\nsurgical trials. Conducting parallel preference arms along-\nside the randomised arms, often called the comprehensive\ncohort design, allows collection of data from participants\nwho are unwilling to be randomised and addresses con-\ncerns about generalisability due to low inclusion rates\n[40]. However, the cost and limited added benefit has\nresulted in limited usage. Offering a new intervention\nonly within the context of an RCT may lift participation\nrates, though evidence for this is limited and this will only\nbe possible if widespread adoption has not occurred [41].\nThe randomisation by consent design (Zelen's design) has\nbeen proposed to address the difficulty of gaining\ninformed consent [42]. Under this approach, eligible\npatients are randomised and consent is sought post-ran-\ndomisation only for those receiving the new interven-\ntions, with consent to standard care presumed\nunnecessary. However, most agree this is not ethical and\nonly moves the problems downstream [28]. Insights into\nthe consenting process may enable increased participa-\ntion while maintaining informed choice [43].\nWhere three or more treatment options are under evalua-\ntion, along with the option of randomisation between all\ntreatments additional options which involve randomisa-\ntion between subsets of interventions can be offered. In\nprinciple this will allow surgeons who feel unable to ran-\ndomise between all treatments to participate in a stratum\nwith which they feel comfortable. For example, the STARS\ntrial involved an evaluation of three surgical interven-\ntions: reduction and fixation, bipolar hemiarthroplasty\nand total arthroplasty [44]. Participating surgeons were\noffered two choices: to randomise between all three inter-\nventions, or only between reduction and fixation, and\nhemiarthroplasty. As noted by Lilford and colleagues, evi-\ndence from non-randomised (indirect) comparisons may\naccount for centre differences [28].\nIntervention definition and inclusion criteria\nTrials which evaluate a surgical intervention will come\nunder scrutiny regarding the patient population and the\nintegrity of the treatment groups [3,21]. A surgical inter-\nvention can be viewed as a complex intervention [45]. Fig-\nure 1 illustrates the main constituent elements. In\nMain constituent elements of a surgical interventionFigure 1\nMain constituent elements of a surgical intervention.Page 4 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2009, 10:9 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/10\/1\/9addition to the interaction of surgeon and procedure, the\nwider context of the surgical team and pre-operative and\npost-operative care are important. Clinically unnecessary\ndelays in receiving treatment, for example due to waiting\ntimes in a national health service context, can also influ-\nence outcome [47]. A relatively loose definition of the\nintervention while maintaining the coherence of the treat-\nment will best reflect practice. A trial comparing hysterec-\ntomy versus medical management left the type and route\nof the intervention performed at the discretion of the\ngynaecologist [38]. In general, broad inclusion criteria\nwill aid applicability of the results and is to be favoured.\nIn the Spine Patient Outcome Research Trial, an evalua-\ntion of surgical versus non-surgical care for lumbar disc\nherniation, only 60% in the surgical arm received surgery\nwhile 45% in the non-surgical arm received surgery, high-\nlighting that substantial non-compliance can occur in\nsome situations [47]. A more explanatory approach with\na tighter definition of participant inclusion and interven-\ntion can be warranted. Whatever the focus of the trial,\nclear reporting of how the treatment was defined and\ncompliance is need [48].\nSurgical learning curve\nA frequent criticism of surgical RCTs, particularly when\nevaluating a new innovation against a standard interven-\ntion, is that the comparison may be inherently 'unfair' due\nto an imbalance in expertise. When a randomised com-\nparison of two forms of gastric cancer surgery, contrary to\nprevious studies, found a higher rate of complications for\nthe newer D2 surgery, it was argued that the surgeons were\nstill learning in the trial and the 'true' performance of D2\nsurgery was not represented [33,49]. This underlying phe-\nnomenon of an improvement in performance over time is\ncommonly referred to as a 'learning curve'. It has been\ndescribed as the most intractable of the obstacles to con-\nducting surgical randomised trials [9,50]. Scenarios in\nwhich a surgical learning curve effect could lead to an\nincorrect conclusion have been outlined [33].\nTwo distinct, though related, learning curves can be\ndefined. First is a community or technology learning\ncurve, related to refinement of the new intervention (both\ntechnology and technique). Second is the personal learn-\ning of individual surgeons which, though impacted by the\nformer, is mainly driven by their personal aptitude, train-\ning and surgical experience, although factors such as the\nmake-up of the surgical team and centre policies also con-\ntribute. Training prepares a surgeon for undertaking a sur-\ngical intervention; however, the extent to which it can\nreplace real case experience is unclear, and it would seem\nthat some expertise can only be acquired in the real-life\nsetting. By adopting a late evaluation strategy, the first\nlearning curve will be overcome whereas the latter will\nremain, though its impact lessened through the gains of\nthe former.\nTwo main options exist for controlling the impact of a\nlearning curve in the context of a clinical trial: a design\nand an analysis approach. In terms of design, entry criteria\nfor eligible participating surgeons can stipulate character-\nistics such as the number of procedures performed, mini-\nmum professional level and training received. For\nexample, a trial comparing open and laparoscopic mesh\nrepair of inguinal hernias required, prior to participation,\nsurgeons to have performed 10 laparoscopic interventions\nand to demonstrate their competence by undertaking\nwith supervision another five interventions [51]. Adop-\ntion of an expertise-based design for surgical trials would\nsimilarly require some mechanism to identify those with\nsufficient 'expertise' to undertake a particular surgical\nintervention.\nIn principle, a statistical assessment of the learning curve\nwould be preferable as it would allow the impact of the\nlearning curve on outcome to be quantified. Until recently\nthis has received relatively little attention, though the\nadvent of minimally invasive interventions has lead to\nincreased interest. Ramsay et al reviewed both the assess-\nment of learning curves in health care and also the statis-\ntical methods used to assess the learning curve across\ndisciplines [35]. In general, studies have focussed upon\nprocess measures such as intervention time, blood loss,\nhospital stay and complication rates, with little focus\nupon more patient-centred outcomes. Generally, the sta-\ntistical methods used have been inadequate, though more\nsophisticated methods are available which can be used. A\nhierarchical model was used for a large trial assessing\nsuturing material and technique for perineal repair [33]. A\npost-hoc analysis in a trial of over 2000 participants,\nwhich compared laparoscopic and open tension-free\nmesh repairs of inguinal hernias, found a reduction in\nrecurrence in the laparoscopic group with surgeon exper-\ntise [52]. Due to the large data requirement for analysis,\ndata on intervention learning is most likely to come, if\navailable, from large non-randomised studies which can\nbe incorporated into corresponding economic evalua-\ntions. A reduction in the five-year recurrence rate of pros-\ntate cancer after radical prostatectomy was observed in a\ncohort of over 7000. This reduction persisted, even after a\nsurgeon had performed a large number of procedures\n[53].\nSurgical trials should report explicitly and informatively\non the prior expertise of the participating surgeons [54].\nFailure to do so will open the trial up to criticism. A survey\nof participating surgeons could provide valuable informa-\ntion. Justification, with reference to the research question,\nshould be made for how the existence of a learning curvePage 5 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2009, 10:9 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/10\/1\/9is addressed. A truly pragmatic trial should seek to include\nexpertise levels which are representative of the surgical\ncommunity in which the intervention will be used. This\nmay require a relatively low level of procedural expertise.\nA trial conducted by the most experienced surgeons in the\nhigh-caseload centres may not transfer readily to other set-\ntings. Conversely, an explanatory trial could seek to\nlargely exclude learning by only including highly experi-\nenced surgeons. An early evaluation could conduct\nexploratory statistical analysis of the learning curve [33].\nTrial Design issues\nBlinding\nBlinding \u2013 the process of withholding knowledge of the\nallocated intervention \u2013 is a key consideration when\ndesigning RCTs. Where successfully achieved, it is recog-\nnised as playing an important role in preventing the intro-\nduction of bias. It can also aid compliance and retention\nof participants [55]. Blinding can be applied to partici-\npants, investigators and the outcome assessors of a trial.\nWhere interventional treatments are involved, blinding\nposes a greater challenge than for pharmaceutical-based\ntreatments [56]. The extent to which blinding is feasible or\nnecessary will depend upon the nature of the interven-\ntions and also the outcome under consideration.\nBlinding of the surgeon for evaluations of surgical tech-\nniques will be impossible. Outcome assessors can, and\npreferably should, be blinded. Surgeons blinded to the\nallocation could assess clinical outcomes [57]. A review of\nRCTs in a leading orthopaedic journal showed large bias\ndue to unblinded outcome assessors [58]. However,\nblinding is not commonly undertaken in surgical trials\n[59]. This is probably partly due to the standard care path-\nway, where patients commonly return to the surgeon who\nperformed their surgery for re-assessment. It may also be\ndue to the mistaken belief that because the operating sur-\ngeon cannot be blinded, no blinding is worthwhile or\nachievable.\nBlinding of participants in surgical trials can often be\nachieved. Where two similar surgical interventions are\ncompared, such as the comparison of two forms of lapar-\noscopic hernia repair, blinding can readily be undertaken.\nWhere surgical interventions differ significantly, blinding\nof the participant is more problematic, though may still\nbe possible. For example, a trial comparison of laparo-\nscopic and open cholecystectomy used the same dressing\nfor both interventions to allow blinding of participants\nand caregivers [60]. Where a surgical intervention is com-\npared with a medical intervention, blinding of the partic-\nipant will not be feasible without some concurrent sham\nintervention, which is unlikely to be considered ethical.\nThe use of placebo or sham surgery, while remaining con-\ntroversial, has been achieved in a number of cases [61]. A\nplacebo-controlled evaluation of arthroscopic surgery for\nosteoarthritis of the knee found no benefit over the sham\nintervention [62]. However, the scope for placebo surgery\nis limited to cases where the risk inherent in the placebo\nsurgery can be balanced against the uncertainty of the\nvalue of the active surgery and its potential harm. Where a\ngenuine treatment alternative is available, surgical or not,\nplacebo surgery would seem neither ethical nor desirable.\nMechanism and timing of randomisation\nConcealment of future allocation is important. It prevents\nmanipulation, conscious or not, of group allocation, pro-\ntecting the merit of randomisation of balanced groups at\nbaseline. Where funding permits, an automated tele-\nphone randomisation service run by a trial office is prefer-\nable. Whatever the mechanism of randomisation, third-\nparty control is highly desirable. Ideally, treatment will be\nreceived soon after randomisation. Randomisation can be\nperformed in the operating theatre where participating\nsurgeons undertake both interventions [51]. Where allo-\ncated interventions are performed by different clinicians,\nas in an expertise-based trial or medical versus surgical tri-\nals, randomisation will need to be earlier. For multicentre\ntrials stratification is important, as even where the most\ntechnical intervention is involved variation between cen-\ntres can be substantial. Minimisation, a numerical\nmethod which allocates a participant to the group which\nmaximises the equality between groups, can be used to\nensure equally distributed prognostic variables where the\ntrial size is small by including factors known or believed\nto strongly influence treatment outcome [63].\nOutcomes\nA variety of outcomes are needed in surgical trials: surgical\nand clinical outcomes, patient-reported outcomes such as\nquality of life measures, and also economic outcomes.\nOutcomes related to the surgical process such as compli-\ncations and other short-term outcomes have received\nmuch focus, particularly for new and complex interven-\ntions. However, longer-term outcomes will for many situ-\nations be more important [9]. Meta-analysts can be\nconfronted with a plethora of outcomes, with outcomes\nsuch as recurrence or complications having varied defini-\ntions. Consensus on which outcomes are important and\nhow they should be measured is needed. Independent\nassessment of outcome is highly desirable. Some out-\ncomes may be prohibitively rare to base trial sample-size\ncalculations upon. Data, on which to base sample-size cal-\nculations, can be limited. Where substantial uncertainty\nexists, an adaptive design approach could be used. In prin-\nciple, all surgical trials will be subject to a clustering effect\nand sample sizes should be inflated to account for this,\nthough the impact is uncertain [64].Page 6 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2009, 10:9 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/10\/1\/9Data collection and monitoring of surgical compliance\nOften, surgical details can only feasibly be collected\nthrough self-report by the surgeon. Independent data col-\nlection, for example through a study nurse, is preferable.\nAdjudication of outcome events by independent and\nblinded review of clinical data adds methodological rig-\nour. Intra-operative photographic evidence of the proce-\ndure has been used to allow independent assessment of\nsurgical adherence to the protocol [65]. Short-term post-\nsurgery data is useful for assessing recovery. Collection of\npatient-reported outcomes, for example through postal\nquestionnaires, provides an important perspective [44]. A\nmeeting of surgeon investigators at the start of a trial along\nwith site visits\/teleconferences during the study can help\nclarify and reaffirm the trial protocol and ensure consist-\nent data reporting.\nStatistical Analysis\nOutcomes following procedures performed by the same\nsurgeon (or centre) will tend to be more similar than\nthose performed by another. Statistical methods which\ntake account of this inherent structure in surgical trials do\nexist and should be used in the analysis where studies are\nof sufficient size [64]. Subgroups of possible treatment\nmodifiers should be considered and analysis based upon\na test for an interaction [66]. For a variety of reasons, par-\nticipants randomised to a surgical intervention may not\nreceive their allocated intervention. Cross-over between\ninterventions is not uncommon for surgical trials and can\nhappen prior, during or post the scheduled intervention\nand can be asymmetric [47]. RCTs should be analysed by\ngrouping participants according to their allocated treat-\nment irrespective of subsequent non-compliance. In some\nsituations an additional analysis, excluding non-compli-\nant cases ('per-protocol' analysis) or using statistical\nmethods which allow a compliance-based analysis, may\nbe useful to provide a more realistic estimate of the com-\npliant setting, especially for more explanatory trials [67].\nPost-randomisation exclusion may be appropriate where\nnew clinical information reveals, after randomisation, the\nparticipant not to be suitable for treatment. However,\nexclusions threaten the value of randomisation, and rea-\nsons should be specified prior to commencement of ran-\ndomisation [68].\nConclusion\nRCTs have played a role in the assessment of surgical\ninnovations and there is scope and need for greater use.\nSurgical trials are difficult to successfully undertake and\npose particular practical and methodological challenges.\nHowever, the inherent value of a well-conducted RCT\nshould not be overlooked. Collaboration between surgi-\ncal and research communities is needed to enable the con-\nduct of appropriate and well-designed trials. Three\nrecommendations for the future conduct of RCTs in sur-\ngery are as follows:\n\u2022 Innovations should be stratified according to their\npotential relevance to practice. The highest impact inno-\nvations should be prioritised for RCT evaluation where\nsuch an evaluation is ethical and feasible. Surgical com-\nmunities could take the lead in this process with input\nfrom the research community and funding bodies to\nachieve this goal.\n\u2022 Pragmatic trials have been under-represented in surgery\nand this approach should be adopted more widely.\n\u2022 Exploratory trials (and by extension, tracker trials) can\nplay a role in the early evaluation of surgical innovations\nand should be more readily considered.\nCompeting interests\nThe author declares that he has no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nJC wrote the manuscript and has read and approved the\nfinal version.\nAcknowledgements\nThe value of discussions with fellow contributors at the Balliol Colloquia on \nsurgical evaluation organised by Professor Jonathan Meakins is gratefully \nacknowledged.
