Historically the term PSF has been reserved for \nformally regulated professions such as architecture, accountancy and law.  However, \nechoing more recent approaches in geography and the social sciences, in this paper we \nextend the sectors included to firms operating in financial services as well as cultural \nindustries such as advertising and design. These firms interest economic geographers \nin two related ways: first, attention has focussed on the way globalizing PSFs become \nembedded in the cities they operate through (Beaverstock et al. 1999; Faulconbridge, \n2007; Grabher, 2001); and second, work has explored the forms of transnational \ninterconnection and flow that have emerged in the knowledge practices used by PSFs \nto provide bespoke services to clients (Beaverstock, 2004; Faulconbridge, 2006; \nGrabher, 2001; Jones, 2007).  Understanding the geographical implications of such \nlocal-global dynamics forms a central tenet of research agendas in geographical \nstudies of globalization, cities and the service economy. Studies that cut across all of \nthree topics have been drawn from a range of sectors including banking, management \n 3\nconsultancy, advertising, legal services and executive search (see Hall 2006; Jones \n2005; Faulconbridge 2007; Beaverstock 2004; Faulconbridge et al. 2008 \nrespectively).   \n \nThis literature has facilitated a more nuanced understanding of the organisational \nstructures used by PSFs as they seek to continue to expand their global reach through \nthe geographical (territorial) and transnational (network) embeddedness of their \noffices (Hess, 2004).  In particular, geographers have developed Dunning and \nNorman\u2019s (1983, 1987) \u2018eclectic\u2019 owenership-location-internationalisation paradigm \nto understand why PSFs have continued to internationlise their operations (on which \nsee Dicken, 2005).  For example, Yeung (2005) has recently used the term \u2018spatial \neconomies\u2019 to understand the process by which firms \u201cexpand \u2026 [their] \norganizational space and \u2026 economize on this spatial expansions.  However, despite \nthe overt recognition in this literature that PSFs are reliant on the knowledge and \nexpertise of their employees, far less attention has been paid to the ways in which \nemployees within such firms develop both the technical expertise needed to operate \nwithin such \u2018professional\u2019 corporate networks and the more embodied competencies \nexpected of them. This neglect of professional education in studies of PSFs in \ngeography is surprising in a number of ways.  For example, in formally regulated \nprofessions such as legal services, education has historically been used by the \nprofession\u2019s regulatory body as a central mechanism to control entry into the \nprofession.  Meanwhile in PSFs more generally, employees are not only expected to \nhave particular higher education experiences in order to secure employment in the \nfirst place (notably a stipulated minimum level of achievement at higher education \n 4\nthat is partly dependent on the university they attended) but also combine ongoing \nprofessional education throughout their careers (Thrift, 2005).   \n \nAs such, the geographical affects of professional education on both employees within \nand the operation of PSFs themselves seem highly significant. We explore this \nsignificance in the rest of the paper and argue that geographers can integrate existing \nliteratures in sociology and management that conceptualise the influence and role of \nprofessional education into contemporary geographical discussions of globalizing \nPSFs.  We make two main points.  \n \nFirst, we show how existing literatures have not interrogated the significance for the \ngeographies of PSFs of education as part of \u2018professional\u2019 projects and principles.1 \nThis is significant in regulatory terms as professional closure acts as a means of \ncontrolling national service sectors in the global economy, thus embedding global \nPSF networks in territorial regulatory apparatus (Hess, 2004).  Second, and relatedly, \nwe explore the challenges PSFs face in using professional education as they seek to \nintegrate nationally distinctive varieties of professional education whilst responding to \n                                                 \n1 The idea of the \u2018professional project\u2019 has been elucidated most succinctly by Abbott (1988). In his \nwork Abbott describes how \u2018traditional\u2019 professions such as accounting, architecture and law have \ndeveloped a \u2018project\u2019 designed to sustain their role and market through closure mechanisms, principally \nreliant on educational qualifications, that limit access to the profession. Only those able to secure a \ndegree from a recognised educational institution are entitled to use the title \u2018accountant\u2019, \u2018architect\u2019 or \n\u2018lawyer\u2019. Professional Associations in each country license universities to provide recognised training. \nConsequently the number of \u2018professionals\u2019 is limited by the availability of places at universities \nproviding accredited training courses with professional association control numbers by regulating the \nnumber of accredited institutions.    \n 5\nthe ways in which processes of globalisation have produced new influences on \nprofessional education and, therefore, professional practices.  In making this \nargument, we suggest that studying professional education is important in the context \nof ongoing discussions of the continued yet changing influences of the varieties of \ncapitalism on economic activities (Clark and W\u00f3jcik, 2005; Clark et al. 2002; Peck \nand Theodore, 2007). The varieties of capitalism literature is very effective at \nhighlighting the way national institutional contexts affect the activities of TNCs and, \nas we show below, the institutional foundations of training and education that \ninfluence national business systems both affect and are affected by global \nprofessionals and PSFs. \n \nBefore proceeding further it is important to define what we mean by professional \neducation.  We use the term to refer to the education from higher (university) level \nonwards that individuals working in PSFs need to complete in order to secure \nemployment.  Whilst the types of activities and qualifications involved vary between \ndifferent types of PSFs, something that we pick up on later in the paper, there are two \ncommon elements that can be teased out.  First, we focus on the higher education \ndegree required to work in PSFs.  For some sectors this is clearly specified (for \nexample in architecture).  However, even when such a clear coupling between PSF \nand higher education does not exist (in the case of advertising for example), PSFs \ntypically favour a relatively limited number of \u2018traditional\u2019 academic disciplines from \nan equally limited, albeit expanding number of universities.  Second, we explore the \neducational experiences post-higher education offered by both professional bodies \nand for-profit education companies to facilitate individuals\u2019 entry into their chosen \nsector.  Such activities exist not only in \u2018established\u2019 professions such as law but also \n 6\nin sectors such as finance where certain professional qualifications must be obtained \nbefore individuals can undertake particular tasks.  Here we pay particular attention to \nthe tension between the ways in which such activities are often offered and regulated \nat a national level whilst individuals are entering fundamentally transnational PSFs.2  \n \nThe rest of our argument focuses on these issues in an Anglo-American context and is \ndeveloped over three further sections.  The following section brings geographical \nwork on professionals and PSFs into dialogue with work in management on \nprofessional education and the sociology of professions.  Next, we explore the \nintersection between existing geographical debates and studies of professional \neducation and professional practice through a comparison of the legal and financial \nservices sectors.  Finally, we conclude by briefly reflecting on how such an approach \nto the study of PSFs, professions and professional education might be grounded and \ndeveloped in future empirical geographical research. \n \nProfessions, professionals and professional service firms \nIn many ways, Thrift (2002) set the stage for studies of professional education within \ngeography when he signalled the importance of MBA programmes and the texts of \nmanagement gurus in shaping business practice.  However, with very few exceptions, \nto date geographers seem to have failed to pick-up the importance of such analyses \n(although see Olds and Thrift 2004).  This is particularly the case in research on PSFs \n                                                 \n2 We do not, therefore, focus upon the in-house training offered by firms as part of training \nprogrammes. This does not mean such education is insignificant. However, our argument here focuses \nmore specifically on non-corporate education provided by nationally-based suppliers in each of the \ncountries global PSFs operate in. This distinction becomes significant in relation to our argument about \nthe regulation and nationally-heterogeneous landscape of professional education. \n 7\n(Faulconbridge and Muzio, 2007).  In order to address this research void we consider \ntwo related ways in which the work of management scholars and sociologists might \nbe developed by geographers in order to think geographically about the role of \nprofessional education in the contemporary internationalisation activities of PSFs, \n \nProfessional education and market regulation \nThe changing nature of the professions has been the subject of considerable debate \namongst scholars working in the field of the sociology of the professions (see Abbott, \n1988; MacDonald, 1995; Nelson and Trubek, 1992). Indeed, although we now \nrecognise a range of different professions, historically in the Anglo-Saxon world the \nterm profession was reserved for only a limited number of occupations \u2013 most notably \narchitecture, medicine, the clergy and law.  These professions shared a number of \ncommon characteristics associated with their \u2018professional project\u2019 (Abbott, 1988) \nwith three standing-out as particularly significant.  First, these professions each had a \ncentral regulatory body that administered a code of conduct for members, typically at \na national scale. Continued membership of the profession was, and continues to be, \ndependent on professionals complying with this code of conduct.  In effect these \nbodies act as the guardians of the profession\u2019s title \u2013 e.g. architect, lawyer etc. \u2013 and \nhave jurisdiction over professionals operating within state-defined boundaries. So in \nthe UK, for example, solicitors were and continue to be regulated by the Law Society \nof England and Wales and the Law Society of Scotland. Second, as guardians the \nnational regulatory bodies manage knowledge within the profession very carefully, \nstrictly defining the expertise associated with the position of architect, doctor etc. \nThird and related, regulatory bodies also administer professional closure such that the \nright to call oneself a professional was limited to those meeting eligibility criteria, \n 8\nallowing numbers and the social make-up within any given profession to be restricted. \nImportantly for our argument in this paper, one of the ways of achieving the second \nand third aims was to rely on educational attainments as a way of defining the \nknowledge base of the profession and as a mechanism for granting entry to \nnewcomers. As Dent and Whitehead (2002:1) summarise, as a result of this tight \ndemarcation and management of professions, a professional member was \n \n\u201csomeone trusted and respected, an individual given class status, autonomy, \nsocial elevation, in return for safeguarding our well-being and applying their \nprofessional judgement on the basis of benign moral or cultural code\u201d  \n \nOf course, as Dent and Whitehead (2002) go on to argue, such a tightly bounded \nnotion of professions is increasingly problematic. At one level, the notion of a \nprofessional is no longer restricted to describe a member of a profession per se but \nhas come to be widely used an adjective that all economic actors are supposed to \naspire to.  In this sense, being professional is seen as a desirable social aim in itself \nrather than necessarily denoting membership of a profession. At another level, the \nterm professional service firm is used to refer to sectors that do not necessarily have \nthe tightly bounded regulation and closure associated with professions such as law.  \nThe notable examples here are management consultancy and executive search.  For \nexample, Gl\u00fcckler and Armbruster (2003) label management consultancy an \n\u2018unbounded profession\u2019 in which national associations of management consultancies \nhave largely failed to have the title \u2018management consultant\u2019 legally protected.  This \nallows the industry to be open to a wide range of other potential providers beyond \nestablished management consultancy PSFs, particularly large accounting firms that \n 9\nhave established their own consultancy departments and smaller niche consultancy \nstart-ups.  In such industries there are few established training or educational \nrequirements beyond holding a first degree. We must, therefore, be prudent when \nconsidering the regulatory value of the title professional and be aware that only for \nthose strictly defined professions of accountancy, architecture and law might the \nregulatory closure argument be valid. Nevertheless, in these cases, which have been \nwidely studied by geographers interested in their PSF manifestation (Beaverstock, \n1996; Beaverstock et al.1999; Faulconbridge, 2007; Warf, 2001), exploring the role of \neducational systems in regulation is valuable. We return to this point below. \n  \nProfessional education and socialisation \nThe second inter-section between professional education and PSFs lies in the ways in \nwhich professional educational experiences not only facilitate entry to PSFs but also \nprepare and socialise (future) professionals into the expected working practices and \ncultural norms of their profession. Two elements to this aspect of professional \neducation stand out as being particularly significant. First, there is an expectation that \nat least some of the skills and technical know-how learnt through professional \neducation will aid the success of an individual when working within a PSF. Indeed, \nthis is reflected in the logic of using educational closure in the \u2018traditional\u2019 \nprofessions and the logic of recruiting graduates into \u2018new\u2019 professions such as \nadvertising.  This is a well-established tradition elsewhere too: one can think of the \nrole plated by the University of Chicago in legitimating financial economics as both \nan academic discipline and its subsequent widespread use in financial services \npractice beyond its US heartland (Bernstein 1992; Dezalay and Garth 2002; Whitley \n1986a; 1986b). This educational process often also continues once individuals join \n 10\nPSFs.  Management theorists have identified the rapid growth of the professional \neducation sector with established \u2018blue-chip\u2019 providers such as business and law \nschools being joined by a range of smaller, niche providers such as specialist training \ncompanies, seminar providers and even online educational services (Friga et al 2003). \nThis group of educational providers all aim to circulate particular types of knowledge \nwhich then informs practice within PSFs.   \n \nSecond, professional education also imparts more subtle embodied knowledges to \nthose joining the profession. In this way, professional education can be seen as one \nway of shaping the subjectivities of professionals as they learn to perform an \nappropriate \u2018professional\u2019 persona.  This has long been recognised as an important \nrole of education in the \u2018traditional\u2019 professions with the ethos and ethics of the \nprofession (public service, fiduciary duty; non-commercialism) assumed to be \ninstilled as part of training programmes (Torstendahl and Burrage, 1990; MacDonald, \n1995). Indeed it has been argued that an elite, exclusionary, culture is often \nproliferated through such professional education with universities recruiting students \nthat fit the gender, race and class stereotypes of the professional \u2018club\u2019 and then \nreinforcing these identities and behaviours through the educational process \n(Somerland, 2007; Stevens, 1995).  Evidence of the importance of this outside of the \n\u2018traditional\u2019 profession include the attempts made by management education \nprogrammes (MBAs especially) to develop in students embodied skills often \ndescribed under the rubric of emotional intelligence, leadership and entrepreneurship. \nThese are increasingly being seen as at least as important as more the more technical \nforms of knowledge discussed above.  As Spender (2005, 1288) argues, \u201cso \nmanagement may be more about the exercise of the managerial imagination [\u2026] than \n 11\nabout the application of a body of rigorous knowledge\u201d.  Indeed, specialist training \ncompanies are being established aimed at cornering the more embodied end of the \nprofessional educational market, specialising in using more performative and \nexperiential learning and teaching techniques (Hinchliffe 2000).   \n \nFor geographers understanding how these educational and socializing forces are \ninfluenced by the intersecting forces of nationally-specific educational systems and \nthe national interpretation of management practices but also global circuits of \nknowledge within and without of internationalising PSFs would seem to be a valuable \nway to explore the processes of and extent to which the proliferation of, for example, \nAnglo-American business practices by the largest organizations is taking place in \nprofessional economies. Whilst Thrift (2002) has shown the importance of exploring \nthe actors involved in the delivery of such professional training associated with \nglobalized cultural circuits of capital, we know less about how their work is consumed \nand reproduced differently between different national contexts as a result of \ninstitutional legacies and national business systems.  It would seem important, \ntherefore, for future geographical research to consider how this circuit becomes \nintertwined with national systems as it is \u2018grounded\u2019 in different places.  \nBelow we, therefore, consider this and the other issues highlighted above through case \nstudies of the differing roles of various forms of education in a formal profession, law, \nand a \u2018new\u2019 profession, banking.  \n \nGeographical and professional variation in professional education \nGeographies of legal professional education \n 12\nIt would be misleading to suggest that there is a single meta-narrative that can \ndescribe every practitioner\u2019s experience of professional education. A lawyer working \non the local high street offering conveyancing, will and divorce advice is unlikely to \nhave the same experience as the lawyer working for a \u2018mega-law\u2019 global firm in the \nCity of London or Manhattan (Hanlon, 1999). Here, then, an attempt is made to \nexplore the main tenets of professional training common to all lawyers, but also its \ninternal and geographical heterogeneity. \n \nFigure 1 summarises the normal pathway of an individual through legal professional \neducational system. We focus upon the \u2018compulsory training\u2019 highlighted in the \ncentre of the diagram as this acts as the basis for all education and is experienced by \nall practitioners. Professional education begins for all lawyers in the form of a law \ndegree. This plays a significant part in the closure regimes associated with \nprofessional projects (Abbott, 1988; MacDonald, 1995) and limits individuals seeking \ntraining to a restricted choice of schools recognised by the national professional \nassociation (e.g. The Law Society in the UK; the Bar Association in the USA). Here \ntraining in the substantive foundations of law is provided ensuring practitioners have \nthe technical knowledge needed to deliver services. In addition, however, as many \nhave noted (Broadbent et al. 1997; Torstendahl and Burrage, 1990; Nelson and \nTrubek, 1992), this training acts as a socializing agent designed to instil the ethos, \nculture and norms of being a lawyer. Indeed it could be argued that the ethics and \nethos of professionalism, as set out by professional bodies, is first established in \npractitioners as a result of the influence of this period of indoctrination. This formal \ntraining associated with qualification is not, of course, the end of professional training \nfor lawyers. Once employed by a firm most professional associations require lawyers \n 13\nto compete a statutory number of hours of continued professional \ndevelopment\/education a year. This is provided by organizations authorised by the \nprofessional associations and is intended to provide updates on the latest legal \ndevelopments. In addition, lawyers in the largest firms are likely to receive significant \nin-house training. Covaleski et al. (1998) suggest that this also has a socializing effect, \nsometimes actually reversing the professional socialization of earlier education. \nIndeed, many law firms now turn to business schools to provide training for their \nlawyers, especially for their partners where effective \u2018management\u2019 behaviours and \nstrategies are honed. This is seen as essential in large firms that increasingly have the \ncharacteristics of global corporations (Cooper et al. 1996; Flood, 1995). Examples of \nuniversities now intimately linked to professional service firms and the development \nof senior workers include Oxford\u2019s Clifford Chance Centre for the Management of \nProfessional Service Firms and initiatives by Harvard\u2019s Law School where partners \nfrom firms spend time on annual MBA-like training events. \n \n[Insert figure 1 here] \n \nSignificantly, all this education and further training has important geographical \ncontingencies. To begin, it seems important to recognise the way the educational \nregimes associated with professional closure continue to have distinctly national and \neven sub-national variability despite pressures of globalization (Broadbent et al. 1997; \nFaulconbridge and Muzio, 2007). This means the affects of  variations in the aims and \ncontent of educational programmes but also completely different systems of \nassessment and training continue to leave indelible marks on professional \npractitioners operating in each country. Table 1 sets-out examples of these variations \n 14\nbetween three national systems. As it suggests, fundamentally different programmes \nexist and are likely to produce lawyers with both different skill-sets but also outlooks \nto professional practice. At its most basic, differences between common law and civil \nlaw training programmes have been identified as producing lawyers with very \ndifferent commercial outlooks (Trubek et al. 1994). More subtly, as both Broadbent et \nal. (1997) and Flood (1995) note, differences in the public-service ethos of lawyers, \ncultures of remuneration and practice norms exist between countries.  \n \n[Insert table 1 here] \n \nAt the same time though, processes of globalisation and the continual growth of the \nglobal law firm (see Beaverstock et al. 1999) seem likely to be introducing new \ndynamics into the traditionally nationally-defined nature of such training. Some \ncountries are now beginning to rollback regulations preventing lawyers trained \noverseas from registering to practice. As Cullen-Mandikos and MacPherson (2002) \npoint out, this was a key part of the English Law Society\u2019s strategy to create a legal \n\u2018big bang\u2019 in London in the 1990s. It is now possible for lawyers to take transfer tests \nto prove the eligibility of their qualifications and their ability to practice despite a lack \nof English legal training. At the same time, however, others (e.g. China, India) have \nused the retention of national restrictions as a tool for resisting the threat of \nglobalisation and preventing the entry of foreign firms and lawyers. Moreover, as \nGiraud and Bauder (2007) show, national professional associations pick and choose \nthe countries whose qualifications they will recognise, often using technical but also \ncultural specifications for acceptance. This dynamic, and the implications for the \n 15\nregulation of professional services and the continuity or change of nationally \ndistinctive models, seems ripe for study by geographers.  \n \nMoreover, it is also reasonable to assume that the professional training practitioners \ncomplete once employed by law firms is significantly influenced by the firm\u2019s \ncountry of origin. As global law firms become more and more influential in a number \nof markets the home-country (Anglo-American) norms of these firms seem likely to \nbe increasingly challenging domestic practices in any one country (see Morgan and \nQuack, 2005; Quack, 2007 for examples of this). The influence of foreign expatriate \nmanaging partners as vectors of knowledge and practice seems to be one important \nstrategy bound-up with this process. (Beaverstock, 2004). At present, however, little if \nanything is known about the geographical peculiarities of this further professional \ntraining. Further studying this, and coupling it to discussions above of the dynamics \nof national educational regimes, deserves further attention in the future and might \nallow important interventions to be made in the varieties of capitalism debates, \nsomething we turn to towards the end of the paper.  \n \nGeographies of financial professional education \nIn common with the legal profession, it is difficult to talk about the geographies of \nfinancial professional education in the singular since they range from foreign \nexchange dealers in stock exchanges through hedge fund managers to retail finance \nemployees.  As such, the following brief discussion of the intersections between \nprofessional education and PSFs in finance uses the case of employees working for \ninvestment banks as a vehicle to highlight the geographical variation in professional \neducation as well as pointing to the necessity for further research in the area.  As \n 16\nshown in Figure 2, three phases of interaction between professional education, finance \nprofessionals and investment banks can be identified. Each revolve around a slightly \ndifferent notion of professions and professionals. However, all point to the complex \nrelationship between the international operations of investment banks and \nprofessional financial education that has historically been nationally determined but \nmore recently has developed transnational characteristics. \n \n[insert Figure 2 here] \n \nFirst, in both the US and UK at the start of their careers new recruits are typically \nhired into investment banks straight out of their first degree although in some of the \nmore technical areas post graduate qualifications in numerate disciplines \u2013 \nparticularly maths and physics \u2013 are becoming increasingly common (Wilmott 2000; \nThe Independent 1998).  As such, in some ways entry to the finance profession is \nrelatively unbounded (see Sturdy 1997 for similar debates surrounding management \nconsultancy).  However, the degree subjects accepted, levels of attainment required \nand the universities attended that are \u2018acceptable\u2019 to investment banks have been hotly \ncontested.  Whilst research suggests that the historical dominance of Oxford and \nCambridge is decreasing in the UK (Jones, 1997), most investment banks still favour \nrecruitment from a relatively small number of universities.  Moreover, they face \ndifficulties applying these criteria to overseas applicants where they are less familiar \nwith the cultural markers of different higher education providers.  Whilst transnational \nagreements are increasingly being forged within the higher education sector in an \nattempt to overcome some of these issues (see for example the ENIC-NARIC \nagreement created by the Council of Europe and UNESCO that seeks to provide \n 17\ninformation on overseas degrees and qualifications more generally), investment banks \nstill maintain a preference to certain types of higher education institutions and \nqualifications often based on historic hiring practices within firms rather than \nevidence of the relative academic merit of different qualifications.  \n \nSecond, following this stage the role of professional education becomes rather more \ncomplicated and geographically differentiated as individuals seek professional \nrecognition to operate as financiers from regulatory and professional bodies.  This \nphase of professional education typically involves individuals acquiring such \ncredentials across a range of national boundaries since regulation are predominately \ncarried out a national scale, in contrast to the transnational operations of investment \nbanks.  For example, in both the US and the UK, recruits needs to pass a series of \nexams run by regulatory bodies in order to be registered professionals in their chosen \ncareers. These are predominately administered at a national level.  In the US, these \nexams are aimed at achieving \u2018registered representative\u2019 status and are administered \nby the National Association of Securities Dealers.  Meanwhile in the UK, recruits \nneed to attain Approved Persons status with the Financial Services Authority, \nsomething that is typically achieved through taking accredited exams offered through \na wide range of specialist providers.  \n \nIn an effort to overcome this mismatch in geographical scale between PSFs and \ninvestment banks, new recruits typically combine these national regulatory \nrequirements with firm based learning which is often transnational in character, \ninvolving periods of training in overseas offices (see Hall 2007).  This transnational \nlevel training, as well as being technical, is often also aimed at inculcating employees \n 18\nwith the softer skills associated with working in particular banks.  Examples here \ninclude the favoured information sources used by different banks when conducting \ninvestment research, the presentation techniques used to attract new clients and the \ndress codes used in bank offices. Taken together, these skills are seen as vital in \nfacilitating entry into the profession (in a loose, relatively unbounded sense) and \ndeveloping an aura of being a finance professional.   \n \nThe third intersection between professional education and financial services focuses \non the more embodied knowledges drawn on to foster a professional workplace \npersona.  Investment banks are increasingly demanding specialist training courses, \noften offered by for-profit education companies such as BPP and Kaplan that meet \nthis need with courses often being run in house by trainers or management \nconsultants. Content is tailored to the \u2018culture\u2019 of a particular investment bank. \nAlthough this section of the industry is most fully developed in the US, it is growing \nrapidly in the UK, reflecting the \u2018Americanisation\u2019 of the City as US investment \nbanks have increased their presence from the mid 1980s onwards and UK and \nEuropean owned banks have increasingly adopted more American working practices.  \nThese courses are much less about regulatory compliance and point towards a close \nand ongoing dialogue between PSFs (in this case investment banks) and professional \neducation as firms seek to capitalise on the value and potential contained within their \nwork force.  As such, they can be related to the social construction of a finance \nprofessional (rather than a profession), focussing on what counts as professional and \nhow it can be taught and learnt.  \n \n 19\nHowever, professional education clearly does not stop once an individual has secured \nemployment within an investment bank.  Indeed, whilst there are a number of ongoing \neducational opportunities through a career in investment banking such as through \nseminars and corporate away days, one of the most significant dimensions occurs in \nthe first five to ten years of work. At this point finance professionals\u2019 educational \nexperiences continue to differ between national jurisdictions, in particular in relation \nto the differences between the roles of the MBA within a financial career.  Indeed, \ndespite being identified by some commentators as one of very few \u2018global degrees\u2019 \n(Mintzberg, 2004), the meaning attached to MBAs varies across space and even \nwithin organizations.  For instance, after working for two or three years in the US, it \nis an expected part of a financial career that recruits will go to a business school to \nobtain an MBA.  Meanwhile, in the UK, the choice to undertake and MBA is much \nmore optional and demonstrates a strong cyclical element such that applications to \nMBA degrees rise significantly during periods of economic retrenchment and then \ndecline starkly in periods of economic recovery when practitioners feel they can learn \nmore from continued employed within their banks.  Moreover, whilst MBA degree \ncourses vary as much by institution as they do by geographic location, the \naccreditation process differs across national boundaries.  For example, in the US \ninstitutions rather than individual degree programs are accredited to offer an MBA \nwith the most prestigious such accreditation service being provided by the \nAssociation to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).  Meanwhile, since \n1967 in the UK, MBA degrees rather than institutions have been accredited through \nthe Association of MBAs with subtly different requirements of MBA degrees when \ncompared to those in the US.   \n \n 20\nTogether, then, this suggests it is important for geographers to consider in more detail \nthe influence of such professional education for three reasons. First, the national \nregulatory dynamic in the first stage of \u2018becoming\u2019 a \u2018professional\u2019 again points to the \npower of regulators to close-off but also differentiate national markets using \neducation-based forms of assessment. At present we know little about how the \ngeographical heterogeneity of these examinations and the training requirements \nassociated with them, align or diverge at national scales and the significance of this. \nSecond, the different geographical scales of professional education that intersect in \nthe life of any one individual deserve our attention. With national regulatory training \nbut also transnational corporate education interesting questions arise about the spread \nof the so-called Anglo-American, hegemonic forms of financial practice (Clark and \nW\u00f3jcik, 2005). The role of national systems in resisting this, and transnational \ncorporate practices in its promotion, has yet to be fully unpicked. Third, the ways the \ncultural circuits of capitalism display geographical heterogeneity (e.g. the MBA) \nsuggests that existing assumptions about the smooth, worldwide proliferation of \nbusiness practice needs careful questioning. The geographical variability identified \nhere challenges both existing analytical lenses (e.g. Anglo-American as a coherent \nunit of analysis) and the ideas that management knowledge and educational practices \nare embedded in universal logics and consumed in the same way worldwide.  \n \nDiscussion and Conclusions \nIn this paper we have offered an initial foray into studies of professional education \nand argued that geographers can learn much from detailed, empirical examinations of \nthe way educational institutions influence the market for and delivery of professional \nservices. We would argue that this is significant because of the interventions in \n 21\nexisting debates that can be made through such studies. First, as we have shown in \nrelation to law, on occasions education can act as a regulatory device to control access \nto professional markets. One of the major brakes on the globalization of law firms has \nbeen the need to recruit locally qualified lawyers and, on occasions in countries such \nas India and China, the need for firms to be solely owned by individuals with local \nregistration. This closure regime that is a well-known part of professional practice \n(Abbott, 1988) has not yet been considered by geographers as one of the modes of \nregulation in the global economy. Indeed, one of the most significant events of recent \nyears have been attempts to create a transnational system of closure whereby \neducational qualifications gain recognition outside of their country of origin. Further \nstudying the implications of such changes would seem a fruitful way of better \nunderstanding the way economic globalisation is regulated.  \n \nSecond and relatedly, studies of professional education seem likely to be a valuable \nway to further push forward debates about the effects of globalisation on national \nvarieties of capitalism (see Hall and Soskice, 2001; Whitley, 1998). This framework \nprovides a useful tool for understanding the role and affects of training and education \nsystems on business and can be used to go beyond existing uses of the varieties of \ncapitalism approach by geographers (see Clark and W\u00f3jcik, 2005; Clark et al. 2002; \nGertler, 2004; Peck and Theodore, 2007). In particular the varieties of capitalism \nliterature raises questions about the predominately nationally based education systems \nand their use transnational PSFs in their ongoing international expansion. As noted in \nthe case of both legal and financial services, educational institutions are recognised as \none of the actors determining national business practices and cultures yet there is a \ncurious silence in geographical literatures about this. Geographers should be \n 22\ninterested in both the national varieties of educational regimes but also the way \nglobalisation has created new influences upon education in the form of the circuits of \nsoft capitalism (Thrift 2002). The activities of globalizing PSFs and their corporate \npractices are yet another variable in this complex state of affairs. As the examples of \nlaw and finance show well, studying educational processes and the geographical \nactors involved in their production and reproduction might allow us to consider the \nway educational practices have or have not been rendered transnational and uniform \nacross space (e.g. the MBA). Indeed, such an approach might allow geographers to \nchallenge the use in the varieties of capitalism literatures of macro-scale concepts \nsuch as Anglo-American that seem likely to be hiding both the complex processes that \nmean points of convergence are emerging in previously divergent systems  (see Clark \net al. [2002] on the emergence of American financial logics in Germany) but also the \npoints of divergence that continue in the English and American systems assumed to \nbe aligned and existing with complementary institutional logics (see MacDonald \n[1995] on variations in US and English legal practices).  With this in mind, we argue \nthat there are rich pickings to be had for geographers from studying the role of \neducation in professional service economies.  \n \nReference List \nAbbott A 1988 The system of professions: an essay on the division of expert Labour \nUniversity of Chicago Press, Chicago,  \n \nBeaverstock J V 1996 Subcontracting the accountant!
