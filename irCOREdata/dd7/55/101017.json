In turn, the reduced ion range subsequently limits the final\ndamage range.

However, efficient p-type doping of GaN\nthrough implantation has been problematic to date because\nof the complex nature of the as-grown defects in GaN, and\nthe defects that are introduced during ion irradiation. A full\nreview1 has summarized the crystal defects that are associ-\nated with the activation process of acceptor atoms in GaN,\nand will not be discussed here. An understanding of the im-\nplant radiation damage formation process in the GaN matrix\nand its removal during thermal processing is required if the\nfull potential of selective area p-type doping in GaN is to be\nachieved. These issues will be addressed in this paper.\nIt has been previously demonstrated that the temperature\nof the semiconductor substrate during ion irradiation affects\nthe formation of radiation damage in the solid. It has been\nshown that for the case of Si, the sample temperature affects\nthe damage creation process,2 and ultimately the defect-\ndriven dopant diffusion during high-temperature annealing.\nIt was observed with ion channeling experiments that the\ndamage formation was reduced in samples implanted at an\nelevated temperature, and that the damage annealing at the\nend of the defect range was not as efficient as in samples\nimplanted at cold temperatures during postimplant annealing.\nThe effect of the substrate temperature upon the damage for-\nmation during implantation in GaAs has also been investi-\ngated by many groups. Although the majority of the work\nfocused upon implantation for isolation \u0001and not doping\u0002,3\nthe trends observed suggest that the damage formed during\nelevated temperature implantation is more stable. Previous\nwork on GaN \u0001Ref. 4\u0002 proposed that a more stable implant\ndamage was formed for elevated temperature implants, in\nline with Si and GaAs, and suggested that lattice expansion\noccurred during cold implantation. It is proposed here that an\nimproved understanding of the processes that occur as a\nfunction of the implant temperature \u0001equivalently a function\nof the dynamic annealing\u0002 will enhance our knowledge and\nunderstanding of the damage formation processes in GaN.\nWe have implanted GaN with Mg ions at energies of 200\nand 500 keV at substrate temperatures of \u2212150 \u0001cold\u0002 and\n+300 \u00b0C \u0001hot\u0002. For the samples implanted at cold tempera-\ntures, an increase in the Ga disorder is observed in the sur-\nface region and the damage peak position is reduced in the\nsolid when compared to implants performed at elevated tem-\nperatures. The secondary-ion-mass spectrometry \u0001SIMS\u0002 pro-\nfiling of Mg in the GaN provides clear evidence that the\ndopant distribution in the solid also depends upon the im-\nplant temperature and it is observed that Mg has a shorter\nrange in GaN for cold implants.

The\nimplant doses have been chosen so that the amount of dam-\nage formed within the region of the damage peak is a con-\nstant irrespective of the implant energy, as inferred by TRIM\nsimulations.5 After implantation, the samples have been sub-\njected to a rapid thermal anneal \u0001RTA\u0002 at a temperature of\n1000 \u00b0C for 20 s in a N2 ambient. In order to avoid decom-\nposition, the proximity method,6 whereby a GaN wafer is\nplaced upon the surface of the sample of interest, was used.\nNo evidence of decomposition was observed with this tech-\nnique.\nThe damage profiles following implantation and anneal-\ning have been obtained with Rutherford backscattering\nspectroscopy7 \u0001RBS\u0002 channelling measurements. RBS was\nperformed with a MV Tandetron accelerator using 3-MeV\nHe giving a depth resolution of 25 nm. Data analysis of the\nraw RBS data utilized the IBA DataFurnace8 which fits the data\nwith elemental profiles and then converts the data from back-\nscattered ions versus ion energy \u0001channel number\u0002 into Ga\ndisorder versus depth. The Mg profile in GaN has been mea-\nsured by SIMS with a Cameca IMS3F machine, using O2\n+\nprimary ion \u000110 keV\u0002 bombardment with positive-ion detec-\ntion. In order to eliminate charging effects on the GaN, a thin\nlayer of Au was deposited on the sample surface prior to\nSIMS and an electron flood gun was used in order to main-\ntain charge neutrality. Dark-field cross-section transmission\nelectron microscopy \u0001XTEM\u0002 has been performed upon se-\nlected samples using a Jeol JEM 2010 with an acceleration\nvoltage of 200 kV. The images were taken in a two-beam\ncondition with the sample tilted around the surface direction\nin order to increase the contrast due to the lattice distortion,\nwithout spreading in the surface projection. The sample cross\nsection was performed with mechanical polishing and the\nfinal step was performed with a Gatan precision ion polish-\ning system \u0001PIPS\u0002 using 5-kV Ar+ ions at 6\u00b0.\nRESULTS\nWe now present and interpret the structural, chemical,\nand theoretical data obtained from Mg ion-implanted \u0001and\nannealed\u0002 GaN. All analysis techniques employed for this\ninvestigation have been performed at room temperature.\nRBS analysis provides an indication of the amount of\ndisplaced interstitial Ga in the solid, and is therefore used as\na measure for the implant damage. The RBS results from\nas-implanted samples are presented in Fig. 1. The Mg doses\nwere chosen so that the peak damage levels are approxi-\nmately constant \u00012.5 at. % \u0002, and hence the differences ob-\nserved are more likely to be implant temperature dependent\nand not dose dependent \u0001however, this may not be strictly\ntrue\u0002. The damage profile extends further into the solid for\nhigher-energy implants as expected, and it can be seen that\nthe shape and the peak position of the damage profile \u0001dis-\nplaced Ga\u0002 depend upon the implant substrate temperature.\nFor the implant energies investigated here, the position\nof the damage peak is reduced in depth for the cold implants.\nThe extent of the reduction appears to depend upon the im-\nplant energy. For 200-keV implantation, the difference in the\ndamage peak position as a function of the implant tempera-\nture is larger \u0001105 nm for cold and 180 nm for hot implants\u0002\nand much more evident than for the 500-keV implant\n\u0001420 nm for cold and 445 nm for hot implants\u0002. For 500\n-keV cold implants, it can also be observed that an increase\nin the amount of displaced Ga can be observed in the surface\nregion \u0001which is not observed for the 200-keV implant due to\nthe high level of damage in that region and\/or the resolution\nof RBS\u0002.\nThe SIMS spectra that are shown in Fig. 2 present the\nMg profiles that are formed in GaN following implantation\nFIG. 1.

It can be\nseen that for both implant energies the Mg range in the solid\nis reduced for cold implants, and the peak position is shifted\ntowards the surface with respect to hot implants. No addi-\ntional contaminated surface layers have been observed on the\nsurface \u0001with SIMS, RBS, and XTEM\u0002 that could cause this\napparent shift in profile position.\nIf we compare the damage peak position \u0001from RBS\u0002\nand the Mg peak position \u0001from SIMS\u0002, then for hot implan-\ntation the Mg peak is deeper than the damage peak. In con-\ntrast, for the cold implants the Mg peak position is shallower\nthan the damage peak position. It is also interesting to note\nthat the shift in the damage peak position as a function of the\nimplant temperature is not the same as the shift in the Mg\npeak position as a function of the implant temperature.\nImplant simulations in GaN have been performed with\nTRIM. It was not possible to consider the implant temperature\nduring the simulation, and the material constants used for the\nion stopping and the recoil formation are applicable to room-\ntemperature conditions. It can be seen in Fig. 3 that theoreti-\ncally, the Mg comes to rest within the solid at a depth beyond\nthe Ga recoil distribution, which is in line with the observa-\ntions made above for the hot implants.\nThe simulations do not match exactly with the measured\nprofiles, and this could be a real consequence of the tempera-\nture \u0001and the rate of dynamic annealing, which is not consid-\nered during TRIM\u0002 and\/or the constants for the material prop-\nerties used \u0001\u0001=6.15 g\/cm3, displacement energy of N in\nGaN is 28 eV and the displacement energy of Ga in GaN is\n25 eV, N.B. the latter two values have been suggested by\nTRIM\u0002. The predicted range of 500-keV Mg ions implanted\ninto GaN at room temperature is 580 nm, and the Mg range\nmeasured experimentally with SIMS is 380 nm for cold im-\nplants and 510 nm for hot implants. The predicted damage\npeak position for 500-keV Mg implanted into GaN at room\ntemperature is 465 nm, and the damage peak position mea-\nsured with RBS is 420 nm for cold implants and 445 nm for\nhot implants. For all case scenarios \u0001including 200-keV\nimplants\u2014results not shown\u0002, the implant profiles formed in\nhot samples match more closely with the simulated profiles.\nWeak-beam dark-field XTEM has been performed upon\nsamples implanted at 500 keV. The RBS data give an indi-\ncation of the displaced Ga in the solid, while the SIMS data\ngive a measure of the Mg profile in the solid. TEM gives a\nmeasure of both Mg and Ga defects, as well as any other\ndefects that reside within the solid, i.e., N defects. In Fig. 4,\nthe difference in the damage distribution for samples im-\nplanted with 500-keV Mg ions at hot and cold temperatures\nis evident. The defect range in the cold sample appears shal-\nlower, while the hot sample shows an extended defect distri-\nbution which, although does not match in depth with the\nRBS \u0001Ga disorder only\u0002 data, is in agreement with the trends\nobserved.\nIt is interesting to note that the differences in the TEM\ndamage profile \u0001particularly the peak position and the end of\nrange damage\u0002, as a function of the implant temperature,\nappear much more apparent than for the RBS data at this\nimplant energy. This is an indication that we are observing\ndifferent defect species. The intensity damage profile has\nbeen extracted from these TEM images \u0001shown in Fig. 3\u0002.\nThe damage peak positions from the TEM analysis \u0001310 nm\nfor cold and 410 nm for hot implants\u0002 do not match with the\nRBS results \u0001420 nm for cold and 445 nm for hot implants\u0002.\nThis difference, as indicated above, is believed to be caused\nby the sensitivity of the TEM analysis technique to different\ntypes of defect in the samples \u0001such as clusters and N defect\ncomplexes that are not detectable with RBS\u0002. The TEM dam-\nage profiles appear shallower than the RBS profiles, and it is\npossible that the Ga atoms detected at the end of range with\nRBS may not be visible to TEM. However, a marked differ-\nence in the damage can be observed at the surface with TEM\nfor cold implants, which is in agreement with the RBS mea-\nsurements when an increase in the interstitial Ga is observed.\nThe stability of the implant damage and the Mg distri-\nFIG. 3.

Damage annealing does\noccur at this temperature \u0003Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002\u0004, and the rate of damage\nremoval shows a dependence upon the implant temperature.\nFor hot implants post-RTA, a damage peak can be observed\nwhich is aligned with the as-implanted damage peak. The\ndamage removal process in the sample implanted at cold\ntemperature is much more effective than in the sample im-\nplanted at the higher temperature. For cold implants the re-\nsidual damage that remains post-RTA is comparable to the\nas-grown level. The increased disorder observed within the\nsurface region for cold samples has been removed during\nRTA. The SIMS profiles in Fig. 5\u0001b\u0002 indicate that the Mg\natoms remain stationary and no diffusion is observed.\nDISCUSSION\nThe dependence of the damage formation and the dopant\nrange in GaN upon the substrate temperature during Mg im-\nplantation has been investigated. Clear evidence has been\nprovided with RBS, SIMS, and TEM analyses that the sub-\nstrate temperature during the implantation process affects the\ndamage formation \u0001volume, complexity, and distribution in\nthe solid\u0002 and the Mg profile. The techniques employed have\nclearly indicated that the damage range and the Mg range in\nthe solid are reduced for cold implantation. It was also dem-\nonstrated that the damage formed in GaN during high-\ntemperature implantation is more stable in nature during fur-\nnace annealing when compared to samples implanted at cold\ntemperatures.\nThese observations can be explained by a change in the\nrate of the dynamic defect annealing caused by the change in\nthe implant temperature. For cold implants the rate of an-\nnealing is reduced and the amount of recoil recombination\/\ndefect annihilation during ion irradiation is lowered in com-\nparison to hot implants. The lack of annealing \u0001or reduced\nannealing\u0002 in cold implants leads to an increase in the rate of\ndamage buildup with respect to the sample implanted at an\nelevated temperature. As the damage builds up for cold im-\nplants, the rate of ion stopping in the solid is increased \u0001due\nto an increase in the number of scattering centers\u0002, and the\nMg range is subsequently reduced. In turn, the reduction in\nMg range inherently reduces the damage profile. As far as\nthe authors are aware, this dopant profile dependence upon\nthe implant temperature has not been reported elsewhere. At\nhigher-temperature implants, although the rate of dynamic\nannealing is raised, the likelihood of a complex defect being\nformed is also increased. As a result, the damage which is\nformed is more stable in nature when compared to the dam-\nage formed in samples implanted at cold temperatures. For\nimplantation performed at cold temperatures, although more\ndefects remain post-implant, they are simpler in nature.\nThese trends are in line with the arguments proposed in Refs.\n2\u20134.\nThe general results collected and the trends observed\nhave been discussed and an argument based on defect dy-\nnamic annealing has been proposed. However, the authors\nfeel that two observations warrant further discussion,\nnamely, the fact that the Mg and Ga disorder peak positions\nchange relatively to each other as a function of the implant\ntemperature, and the fact that the shift in Mg peak position as\na function of temperature does not match the shift in the Ga\ndisorder.\nWe have measured the displaced Ga distributions and the\nMg distributions as a function of the implant temperature.\nFor fixed implant doses, the position of the Mg peak in the\nhot samples is always beyond the Ga damage peak position\n\u0001as also predicted with TRIM\u0002, and for cold implants the Mg\npeak position always lies below the Ga damage peak posi-\ntion. As discussed above, due to the level of dynamic defect\nannealing, the rate of ion stopping is increased for cold im-\nplants, and hence the number of displaced atoms that remain\nin the solid for each individual ion postirradiation will be\nraised when compared to hot implants. We propose that this\nextra generation of displaced atoms for the cold implants\nexplains why the Ga disorder always extends beyond the Mg\nprofile \u0001and also why the Ga disorder at the surface is higher\nfor cold implants\u0002 when compared to hot implants.\nThe change in the disordered Ga profile as a function of\ntemperature is not matched by the same change in the Mg\nprofile. This suggests that although the trends are consistent\n\u0001as they move in the same direction\u0002, the magnitude of the\nmovement is not constant. This suggests that the Ga and the\nMg transport properties in the solid are different.\nCONCLUSION\nThe radiation damage formation process and the Mg\nrange in GaN during Mg ion implantation depend upon the\nimplant temperature. For cold implantation \u0001\u2212150 \u00b0C\u0002, when\nthe level of defect dynamic annealing is reduced, the Mg\nrange is reduced in the solid due to the increase in disorder\n\u0001scattering centers\u0002. As a consequence, the damage range is\ntherefore reduced. The damage stability during postimplant\nfurnace annealing \u00011000 \u00b0C\u0002 has also been investigated.
