Campbell & K. Scott    \n \nworker shortages - Global recommendations and guidelines (herein called \nTask Shifting) to contribute to HIV\/AIDS prevention, care and treatment \nand the achievement of several Millennium Development Goals in low \nincome countries. Our analysis suggests that the WHO\u2019s proposal for \nCHW programs adequately takes into account five key lessons learned \nfrom past CHW programs: the need the need for strong management, \nappropriate CHW selection, suitable training, adequate retention and \nincentive structures, and good relationships with other healthcare workers. \nHowever, the WHO neglects to recommend a sixth factor that has been \nfound to be of critical importance in previous CHW programmes: the need \nfor community embeddedness. We suggest that rather than being an \noversight, this omission represents the latest in a broader movement \nwithin the WHO and other global health initiatives away from community-\nfocused primary health care to biomedically-focused selective health care. \nFurthermore we argue that this omission undermines the likelihood that \nCHWs will be able to achieve many of the goals laid out for them in the \nTask Shifting document. \nThis paper has four sections. First, we present some background \ninformation to place Task Shifting and CHW programs in context. Second, \nwe outline the types of tasks that the document recommends should be \nshifted to CHWs, making a distinction between medically oriented tasks \nand socially oriented tasks. Third, we review the literature on past CHW \nprograms to produce a systematic account of the types of supports that \nRetreat from Alma Ata?  3 \nCHWs will need in order to successfully implement these tasks, \nhighlighting its neglect of the community level of analysis and action. We \nconclude with a discussion of why community embeddedness in CHW \nprograms is necessary and how it can be fostered.  \n \nBackground on WHO Task Shifting in International Policy \nThere is currently a severe global health worker shortage, with a \ndeficit of more than four million people (WHO 2007). The problem has \nreached a critical level in many sub-Saharan African countries, as well as \nparts of Asia and the Americas (WHO 2006a). This lack of \u201chuman \nresources for health\u201d (HRH) is significantly impeding progress towards the \nrealization of the Millennium Development Goals to reduce child mortality \n(Goal 4), improve maternal health (Goal 5), and combat HIV and AIDS, \nmalaria and other diseases (Goal 6) (WHO 2008c).   \nIn 2006 the WHO proposed the Treat, Train, Retain (TTR) strategy \nto strengthen and expand health workforces in low income countries \n(WHO 2007). While TTR aims to address the HRH crisis for all health \nissues, it specifically addresses health worker shortages in the context of \nHIV\/AIDS (WHO 2006b). It aims to better care for health workers who are \ninfected with HIV or other illnesses (the \u201cTreat\u201d component), expand the \nhealth workforce by training new people and making more efficient use of \nhealth resources (\u201cTrain\u201d), and retain current skilled staff through better \n4  C. Campbell & K. Scott    \n \nincentives, better work environments and preventing HIV transmission to \nhealth workers (\u201cRetain\u201d).  \nTask Shifting is the WHO\u2019s policy to address the \u201cTrain\u201d component \nof TTR. It proposes that some healthcare tasks be delegated to less \nspecialized health workers who require shorter training periods. For \ninstance, Task Shifting recommends that the prescription of anti-retroviral \nmedication (ARVs) be delegated from physicians to nurses. This shift will \nfree more of the physician\u2019s time for dealing with severe and special \nillness cases in hospitals. It will also increase access to ARVs for people \nrequiring antiretroviral therapy (ART) in rural areas with health centers \nstaffed only by nurses. Some of the nurse\u2019s tasks, such as health \neducation and administering ARVs, can be further shifted to workers with \nless training. This shifting necessitates rapidly expanding the human \nresource pool through recruiting and training community members to \nserve as \u201ccommunity health workers\u201d (CHWs). CHWs can act as one or \nmore of the following: full- or part-time health workers, educators, nurse \nassistants, and lay councilors (WHO 2008a). Selecting HIV-positive \npeople to act as lay councilors for HIV\/TB treatment adherence has \nproven successful in several preliminary task shifting efforts (MSF 2007). \nThe final \u201ctask shift\u201d proposed is the delegation of some elements of \ndisease management to patients themselves, for example training people \nliving with HIV\/AIDS (PLWHA) or people living with diabetes to self-\nmanage their medication. WHO policy documents stress that task shifting \nRetreat from Alma Ata?  5 \nshould not result in second-rate medical care, but can instead meet the \ndemand for service while maintaining quality through an adequate \nregulatory framework, careful monitoring and high standards (WHO \n2008b).   \nTask Shifting was first presented as a specific strategy for dealing \nwith shortages in human resources for health (HRH) in the 2004 Joint \nLearning Initiative (JLI 2004) and the WHO\u2019s Integrated Management of \nAdult and Adolescent Illness (IMAI) (WHO 2004). By 2006, health worker \nshortages was the focus of the WHO\u2019s annual World health report, with \ntask shifting playing a central role. In 2008 the first official WHO guidelines \nand recommendation publication was released, accompanied by the first \nconference on task shifting in Ababa (WHO 2008c).  \n \nBackground on Community Health Worker Programs and the Alma \nAta \nThe WHO\u2019s Task Shifting proposes a massive revival of state \nsponsored CHW programs. Engaging local, non-professional people from \nmarginalized communities in the provision of health education and care for \ntheir peers first rose in popularity during the primary healthcare movement \nof the 1960s. The first CHW programs, which began in the mid 1950s, \nwere China\u2019s barefoot doctors and Thailand\u2019s village health volunteers \nand communicators (Lehmann & Sanders 2007; Kauffman & Myers, 1997; \nSringernyuang, Hongvivatana & Pradabmuk, 1995; Zhu et al., 1989). \n6  C. Campbell & K. Scott    \n \nLinked to the decolonialization and democratization movements of the \ntime, CHW programs envisioned local people as agents of social change \nand community self-reliance (Lehmann, Friedman & Sanders 2004).  \nThe WHO\u2019s 1978 Alma Ata Conference solidified primary \nhealthcare as the central focus of health-related projects in the developing \nworld, rejecting \u201cmedical elitism,\u201d emphasizing appropriate technology, the \nutilization of lay health workers, and community participation (Cueto \n2004). Influential health theorists argued that transporting western, \nhospital-based, medically oriented and technocentric healthcare \napproaches to developing countries was failing to address the root causes \nof illness (such as John Bryant\u2019s Health and the Developing World (1969), \nCarl Taylor\u2019s Doctors for the Villages (1976) and Kenneth W. Newell\u2019s \nHealth by the People (1975)).  \nAs the political climate shifted towards neo-liberalism in the late-\n1980s and original attempts at CHW programs proved far more difficult \nthan anticipated, CHW programs gradually fell from favour (Abbott 2005). \nCHW programs tended to have been planned hastily and implemented in \na top-down fashion, failing to make any lasting improvement in health \noutcomes and failing to bring about permanent health-related behaviour \nchange (Schneider, Hlophe & van Rensburg 2008). Originally envisioned \nas a means of involving local people in making decisions about their \nhealth needs and increasing community activism, CHW programs too \noften came to serve as undervalued and poorly resourced additions to the \nRetreat from Alma Ata?  7 \nexisting health service (Schneider et al. 2008). By the end of the 1990s, \nmost national CHW programs had been disbanded.   \n \nThe CHW\u2019s tasks: socially oriented vs. medically oriented \nThe Task Shifting document details the WHO\u2019s 22 \nrecommendations for the implementation of task shifting. These include \nfast-tracking amendments to national regulations to enable task shifting, \ninstituting adequate incentives to minimize worker attrition, and suggesting \nwhich specific tasks can be shifted to which workers (WHO 2008a). \nCountry specific programming is encouraged. \nTo guide countries that are considering implementing the Task \nShifting recommendations, the WHO lists which tasks in the field of HIV \ntreatment and management can be taken on by different health worker \ncadres (WHO 2008a). Categorized under 12 headings, such as Clinical \nManagement of HIV and Palliative Care, 313 specific tasks are listed as \nessential for preventing the transmission of HIV, identifying HIV-positive \npatients, providing basic HIV clinical management, and initiating and \nmaintaining ART. Of the 313 tasks, the WHO recommends that 115 can \nbe preformed by CHW. Of these 115, 48 tasks are related to medical skills \nsuch as weighing, taking vital signs, filling out patient registries, \ndetermining whether a patient is pregnant and determining Hepatitis B \nvaccination status. The remaining 67 are more socially oriented, requiring \nCHWs to counsel, support, advise, educate or give information to patients \n8  C. Campbell & K. Scott    \n \nand other laypeople (WHO 2008a). These tasks relate both to HIV \nprevention and to improving HIV management through ART. The \nimportance of having both hard, technical skills and soft, social skills has \nbeen emphasized in many studies relating to health care workers (Rotor \n2000, Roter & Hall 1993, Carpiac-Claver & Levy-Storms 2007).  \nMedically oriented tasks are fundamentally different from socially \noriented tasks; the former demand technical competence and adequate \ntraining in the use of instruments such as thermometers and scales; the \nlater require rapport, trust, understanding and the ability to communicate \neffectively with the target group or individual. Medically oriented tasks \nfocus on individuals and are performed in clinical environments where \nbiomedical expertise reigns. In contrast, much socially oriented work, such \nas seeking to increase public awareness and change health related \nbehaviours, takes place in communities.  \nNoting that CHWs have been assigned both types of task is \nimportant because it affects the types of supports that CHWs will need to \nperform successfully. In the case of CHW programs as envisioned by the \nWHO, successful CHW programs are those in which CHWs perform as \n\u2018another pair of hands\u2019 in clinics to help nurses and physicians perform \nmedical tasks and perform as educators and health promoters in the \ncommunity (WHO 2008a, Annex 1).  \n \nRetreat from Alma Ata?  9 \nConditions most likely to enhance the effectiveness of community \nhealth workers \n \nLiterature review overview \nWhat does existing experience tell us about factors that will increase the \nlikelihood of success of CHW programs? Over sixty years of CHW history \noffers Task Shifting a wealth of past experience to draw from when \nsuggesting future policy. We conducted our literature review keyword \nsearching \u201ccommunity health worker\u201d + review for the years 1960 to 2008. \nThe following additional terms of CHW were also used: lay health worker, \nlady health worker, family health worker, and indigenous health worker. \nThe search was conducted in PubMed, supported by Google Scholar, \nwhich directed us to resources in the journal literature (e.g. Ovid, \nProQuest, Wiley-Blackwell Interscience, ScienceDirect). We began by \nreviewing large-scale review articles of CHW programs for this report. \nThereafter, where appropriate, we followed up articles detailing the \nexperiences of specific CHW programs to provide specific examples of \nthemes and commonalities highlighted by the large-scale reviews.  \nEight reviews were found that amalgamated lessons learned and \nsuggested key enabling features that can increase likelihood of CHW \nprogram success. These were reports by Gilson et al. (1989), Ofosu-\nAmaah (1983), Witmer et al. (1995), Bhattacharyya et al. (2001), Nemcek \nand Sabatier (2003), Lehmann, Friedman and Sanders (2004), Haines et \n10  C. Campbell & K. Scott    \n \nal. (2007), Gilroy & Winch (2005) and Lehmann and Sanders (2007). In \naddition, two large reviews evaluated the literature on CHW programs to \ndetermine their effectiveness: Lewin et al. (2005) and Swinder (2005). Our \nreview of these documents, as well as twenty reports on specific CHW \nprograms, has enabled us to compile a comprehensive account of the \nconditions that can improve the outcomes of CHW programs, variously \nmeasured by completion of program objectives, program sustainability, or \nimpact on health care access, cost, and quality (Witmer et al. 1995). \nIn the following subsections we isolate the recommendations from \nthese reviews and assess the Task Shifting document in relation to these \nrecommendations. The subsections are: (1) strong management and \nsupportive supervision; (2) appropriate selection; (3) suitable training; (4) \nadequate retention and incentive structures; (5) good relationship with \nother healthcare workers and (6) community embeddedness.  \n \nStrong management and supportive supervision  \nStrong management and supportive supervision were seen as \ncentral to the success of CHW programs (Haines et al. 2007; \nBhattacharyya et al. 2001, Lehmann & Sanders 2007). Strong on-site \nmanagement is vital to CHW programs because they are situated on the \nperiphery of the health system and in underserved areas where program \nfocus (Lehmann & Sanders 2007, Stinson et al., 1998). The physical and \nexperiential distances between program administration (in the city, by the \nRetreat from Alma Ata?  11 \ncentral government) and implementation (in villages, by local people) can, \nwithout strong management and supervision, lead to ill-defined ownership \nand accountability (Lehmann & Sanders 2007, Stinson et al., 1998). \nMoreover, CHWs need strong supports because they receive only brief \ntraining and are equipped with a bare minimum of supplies (Gilson et al. \n1989).  \nMost commonly, nurses take primary responsibility for CHW \noversight, despite their lack of management training and already high \nworkload (Nemcek & Sabatier 2002, Lehman, Friedman & Sanders 2004). \nNurses often respond to this unwelcome burden by transforming CHWs \ninto nurse assistants, removing them from their original role in the \ncommunity and placing them in the clinic (Gilson et al. 1989).  Foisting \nprogram management onto an unequipped party can lead to frustration for \nall involved, lower quality service delivery, power struggles and high \nattrition rates.  \nHow does Task Shifting address the need for strong, consistent, \nsupportive management? The document clearly recognizes the \ncomplexities and challenges of assigning supervision roles to medical \nprofessionals, stressing that supervisors should be competent and have \nsupervisory skills (Recommendation 11, WHO 2008a, p. 31) They suggest \nthat proper supervision may even require hiring extra workers specifically \nto assume supervisory responsibilities (WHO 2008a, p.32).  \n \n12  C. Campbell & K. Scott    \n \nAppropriate selection \nSeveral reviews cite appropriate CHW selection as a key enabling \ncondition (Ofosu-Amaah 1983, Witmer et al. 1995; Bhattacharyya et al. \n2001, Lehmann & Sanders 2007). CHWs must be people who are already \ntrusted members of the community (Nemcek and Sabatier 2003), who \nplan to stay in the community (Robinson & Larsen 1990) and who reflect \nthe linguistic and cultural diversity of the population served (Witmer et \nal.1995). Selecting workers who are not trusted and respected by the \ncommunity, who misunderstand their role or have unrealistic expectations \nleads to high attrition rates, poor worker performance, and low community \nengagement with the program (Bhattacharyya et al. 2001; Nemcek and \nSabatier 2003; Witmer et al. 1995).   \nThe process of finding such a CHW is challenging. While most \nprograms state that CHWs should be selected by the community, in \npractice they tend to be selected at least in part by health personnel \n(Gilson et al. 1989; Schneider, Hlophe, & van Rensburg 2008). Local \npeople may have limited time and resources to devote to CHW selection \nand local politics and tradition may lead to the selection of higher status \nbut inappropriate CHWs (Haines et al. 2007). These problems led one \nreviewer to suggest that a balance must be struck between community \nselection and input from outside administrators (Ofosu-Amaah 1983 in \nLehmann and Sanders 2007). Other reviews maintain that despite the \ndifficulties, community selection must remains central to the success of \nRetreat from Alma Ata?  13 \nprograms (Bhattacharyya et al. 2001; Lehmann, Friedman & Sanders \n2004).  \nTask Shifting does not specifically address the selection of CHWs. \nNonetheless, under recommendation 8 on the creation of well-defined \nroles and competency levels for each cadre of health worker, they do \ndirect readers to the large body of literature on CHW selection and \nrecruitment (p. 27). More attention needs to be paid to finding an effective \nand realistic CHW selection method.    \n \nSuitable training  \nThe duration, location and style of CHW training varies greatly \nacross programs (Lehmann & Sanders 2007) making it difficult to identify \nspecific characteristics of training that are known to increase the likelihood \nof CHW success. Nonetheless, there is strong support for the \nimplementation of ongoing training that includes multiple refresher and \nadvancement sessions throughout the program\u2019s duration (Ashwell & \nFreeman, 1995; Ande, Oladepo & Brieger, 2004; Lehmann, Friedman & \nSanders 2004). Skills-based competency training (Gilroy & Winch 2006) \nhas become more popular in the last decade, whereas training that \nfocused on the more abstract aspects of health and wellness used to be \nmore prevalent (Gilson et al. 1989). This shift could suggest that such \ntechnical training has been found to increase the likelihood of success; \n14  C. Campbell & K. Scott    \n \nUNICEF in particular is a strong advocate of skills based competency \ntraining (Gilroy & Winch 2006).  \nCHWs are most likely to succeed when training includes both the \nmedical, technical elements of health and the study of environmental, \npsychological, economic, cultural and social factors that affect health \n(Lehmann, Friedman & Sanders 2004; Gilson et al. 1989; Bhattacheryya \net al. 2001; Lehmann & Sanders 2007). Training must equip CHWs to \nfunction effectively within their communities, rather than prioritizing \ntechnical training over socially oriented training. Lehmann, Friedman & \nSanders (2004) also suggest that training should use adult education \nmethods such as being experiential, learner-centred and problem-\noriented.  \nIt is difficult to navigate seemingly contradictory lessons about \nCHW training from reviews of past programs. On one hand, CHW training \nis supposed to equip the worker to identify social causes of ill health and \nthink about addressing them at the community level (Gilson et al., 1989). \nTraining CHWs to facilitate communities to define and solve their own \nproblems rather than provide information on health problems has been \nvery successful in some interventions (Rifkin, et al. forthcoming). On the \nother hand, CHWs have been found to appreciate specialized, clearly \ndefined tasks (Mullan & Frehywot 2007; Dovlo 2004). Attaining proficiency \nat only a few specific skills requires competency-based, logistical training \nrather than open dialogue about the community environment. Attempting \nRetreat from Alma Ata?  15 \nto impart specific medical skills and knowledge to CHWs along side \ndiscussion of the environmental factors contributing to ill health will require \nmore time and effort. If both are attempted hastily, CHWs may be \nconfused about their role and lack the competency to perform biomedical \nservices and give advice.   \nTask Shifting has chosen to emphasize nationally standardized, \ncompetency-based training (p. 28). This decision recognizes the \nimportance of consistence and quality assurance through accreditation. \nUnfortunately, such training preemptively stifles the potential of CHWs to \nperform anything but technical services. Simply training CHWs to be \n\u2018another pair of hands\u2019 in the sorely deficient health sector would be \nlaudable were this to be the CHW\u2019s only task. However, CHWs are \nexpected to perform tasks that extend far beyond biomedical services. \nThey have also been designated educators and counselors. For these \ntasks, CHWs will require holistic, environmentally sensitive training. This \npoint is taken up below.  \n \nAdequate retention and incentive structures \nRetaining CHWs once they have been trained will greatly increase \nthe likelihood of CHW program success. Attrition rates of CHWs range \nfrom 3.2 to 77 percent and present a major problem for CHW programs \n(Bhattacharyya et al. 2001). It is costly to train new workers, reduces the \nlikelihood of building relationships between workers and communities, and \n16  C. Campbell & K. Scott    \n \nstunts opportunities to build an experienced worker base. While salaries \nare the most obvious tool to help retain workers, other incentive structures \nhave proven effective as well, especially when salaries are low and \nirregular. Bhattacheryya et al. emphasizes the potential of non-monetary \nincentives and cautions that paying workers \u201coften bring[s] a host of \nproblems\u201d because salaries are often unsustainable and can create \nconflicts between different cadres of workers (2001, p. 35).  \nWorker recognition (though uniforms, certificates and badges), \nopportunity for career advancement, supportive supervision and an \nenjoyable work experience can all encourage CHWs to stay on the job. \nClearly defined tasks and a manageable work load increases CHW job \nsatisfaction (Mullan & Frehywot 2007; Dovlo 2004). Moreover, CHW \nprograms have stronger retention if CHWs gain higher social status in the \ncommunity through their positions, by performing a valued, prestigious \nrole and making useful social contacts. For example, Hadley & Maher \n(2000) found that enabling CHWs to play a curative role in the community, \nrather than just a prevention and education role, increases the CHW\u2019s \nability to provide what the community wants and thereby increase her \nreputation. However, it must be stressed that for large scale CHW \nprograms taking on extensive public health tasks, building a health \nworkforce on volunteers is unfair to both the workers and service users \nand unsustainable (Miles, et al. 2007; Campbell, Gibbs, Maimaine, & Nair \n2008).  \nRetreat from Alma Ata?  17 \nTask Shifting has paid close attention to the necessity of proper \nremuneration. Under recommendation 14 the report recognizes that while \nvolunteers can make a large contribution to national health services, \ntrained health workers providing essential health services must be paid \nand\/or compensated adequately through additional incentives (WHO \n2008, p. 35) Recognizing the importance of proper remuneration will go a \nlong way towards reducing attrition and maintaining a highly motivated \nworkforce. However, payment will likely be low, considering that Task \nShifting is aimed towards low income countries. Therefore, it is valuable to \ntake into account the role that additional incentives can play in retaining \nCHWs. Developing programs that are well managed and supported will go \na long way towards keeping CHW moral and commitment high. \nBhattacheryya et al (2001) suggest that such non-monetary incentives \nmay in fact be superior to payment in situations where salaries are not \nreliable and adequate.  \n \nGood relationship with other healthcare workers \n Regular contact with other members of the healthcare system that \nis characterized by respect increases the likelihood of CHW program \nsuccess (Haines et al. 2007, Gilson et al. 1989, Lehmann, Friedman & \nSanders 2004). While closely linked to supportive supervision, CHW \nprograms thrive when workers have a good relationship with other \nmembers of the healthcare system. Physicians, nurses and administrators \n18  C. Campbell & K. Scott    \n \nmust be encouraged and taught to interact with CHWs in a way that \nacknowledges the CHW\u2019s specific skills, experience, value and potential \n(Schneider, Hlophe & van Rensburg 2008). Hierarchical and paternalistic \nrelationships between professionals and CHWs reduce the likelihood of \nCHW retention and stunt opportunities for the health care system to \naccommodate the unique, hands on knowledge of CHWs (Lehmann, \nFriedman & Sanders 2004; Haines et al 2007).  \nTask Shifting notes the importance of training medical professionals \non how to best work with CHWs, emphasizing respect and \ncommunication. They suggest that new supervisors receive training on \nmanagement skills and communication and mentoring skills (WHO 2008a, \np. 32). \n \nCommunity embeddedness \nThe condition for CHW program success that is emphasized most \nstrongly in the literature is the need for CHWs to have a strong \nrelationship with the community (Gilroy & Winch 2005; Mathews, van der \nWalt & Barron, 1994; Quillian, 1993, Gilson et al. 1989; Haines et al. 2007; \nNemcek & Sabatier 2000, Bhattacharyya et al. 2001; Lehmann & Sanders \n2007). Bhattacharyya et al. (2001, p 36) state concisely:  \n \nIn the end, the effectiveness of a CHW comes \ndown to his or her relationship with the \nRetreat from Alma Ata?  19 \ncommunity. Programs must do everything they \ncan to strengthen and support this relationship. \n \nThis strong relationship, termed community embeddedness \n(Schenider, Hlophe & van Rensburg 2008), is important for several \nreasons. Evidence suggests that programs managed and developed by \ncommunities, often with assistance from religious groups or NGOs, more \neasily address local perceived needs and interests than those developed \nby outsiders (Nemcek & Sabatier 2002, Lehmann & Sanders 2004, \nKaithanthara 1990, Sundararaman 2007). CHWs will be better able to \nperform socially oriented tasks if they have the respect in the community \nand are considered a member of the community (Bhattacharyya et al. \n2001). Socially oriented tasks, such as health education and behaviour \nchange promotion, demand that health workers understand marginalized \npeople and are understood by them; this communication comes naturally \nto CHWs since they are themselves members of the community. The daily \nfunctioning of CHWs will be easier if those they work with (i.e. community \nmembers) support them and have realistic expectations about what they \ncan do (Gilroy & Winch 2005). The attrition rates will be lower if CHWs are \nvalued by the community and gain higher social standing through their \nwork (Gilson et al. 1989, Bhattacharyya et al. 2001; Lehmann & Sanders \n2007) \n20  C. Campbell & K. Scott    \n \nHowever, communities are not homogonous and the underserved \ncommunities where CHWs programs tend to be implemented are no \nexception (Bhattaracharyya et al. 2001). They will have complex power \ndynamics and systems of oppression that tend to make the most \nmarginalized people least likely to become involved in CHW programs \n(ibid). Working with existing community groups can guard against CHWs \nbeing used as pawns by elite community members (Bhattaracharyya et al. \n2001, Gilroy & Winch 2005, Haines et al. 2007).  \nCommunity embeddedness can be fostered through a number of \nmeasures. Primary among them is community participation, which means \ninvolving local people in CHW selection, program goal setting and \nprogram management (Haines et al. 2007, Lehmann, Friedman & Sanders \n2004, Gilroy & Winch 2005, Bhattaracharyya et al. 2001). It is also \nimportant to insure that CHWs have high standing in community through \nvisible measures such as government recognition, uniforms, badges and \ndrug kits (Haines et al. 2007, Gilroy & Winch 2005, Bhattacharyya et al. \n2001). Community embeddedness can also be fostered through \ncommunity recognition of CHWs and ensuring that CHW remain close \nenough to the community to be considered one of them (Schneider, \nHlophe & van Rensburg 2008). Fostering local support from institutions \nalready embedded in the community such as local youth groups or \nchurches can increase community support for CHW programs (Gilroy & \nWinch 2005, Haines et al. 2007, Bhattacharyya et al. 2001). It is also \nRetreat from Alma Ata?  21 \nimportant for CHW programs to strike the right balance between \ngovernment regulation and community control (Haines et al. 2007, \nSchneider, Hlophe & van Rensburg 2008). \nHow does Task Shifting address the necessity for community \nembeddedness? The literature and guidelines in Task Shifting tend to \nfocus on the technical considerations of implementing CHW programs \nsuch as training timelines, role delineation, payment structures, \ncredentialing, and supervision hierarchies (Zuniga 2006, Pillay & Mahlati \n2008; Samb et al. 2007, WHO 2008a). In its current state, there is no \nmention of how CHW programs will be community-specific and relevant. In \nfact, there is no mention of community participation in Task Shifting at all, \naside from a passing reference in the section on wages to a Brazilian \nfamily health program that used this technique (WHO 2008a, p. 36).  \nThe only other mention of participation specifically avoids involving \nthe general community in which CHWs live. Task Shifting suggests only \nthat PLWHA should be able to participate in discussions on changing \nnational regulations on health workers rights. Communities as a whole, \ndespite the role they play in supporting or rejecting CHW programs \n(Bhattacharyya et al 2001; Lehmann & Sanders 2007; Schneider, Hlophe \n& van Rensburg 2008) are excluded from consideration.  \nThe report does suggest that \u2018stakeholders\u2019 be consulted and that \ncommunity sensitization and education is necessary (p.16). According to \nTask Shifting, stakeholders include \u201cpeople living with HIV\/AIDS\u201d (p. 3) \n22  C. Campbell & K. Scott    \n \nand \u201cgovernment representatives from HIV programmes and human \nresources for health departments from health ministries (including from \ncountries that have experience of implementing a task shifting approach); \nUnited Nations agencies; donors; health workforce representatives \nincluding professional associations and unions; academic institutions; civil \nsociety organizations and representatives of people living with HIV\/AIDS\u201d \n(p. 9). It appears that the communities from which CHWs are recruited, \nand who are the targets of much of the CHWs health education and HIV \nprevention work, are not considered stakeholders.  \nAccording to Task Shifting, the aim of community sensitization is to \nconvince local people to support task shifting policies in the form that the \nnational government has chosen. There is no mention of consulting \ncommunities to increase community embeddedness, for example through \nhaving community members help structure and control the program.  \nCountry-specific programming is encouraged by the WHO through \nsuggesting that countries adapt Task Shifting to meet their needs and \ncircumstances. Community-specific programming is not explicitly \nencouraged. However, Task Shifting does recommend that countries \ngather information on the extent to which task shifting is already taking \nplace in different regions. This internal research will likely encourage \ncentral governments to recognize and bolster regionally developed HIV \nresponses. However, states will likely find it difficult to balance the creation \nRetreat from Alma Ata?  23 \nof \u201ca nationally endorsed framework that can ensure harmonization\u201d with \ncommunity-specific programming (WHO 2008, p. 3).  \n  \nTracing the trajectory of community embeddedness \nBy failing to emphasize the importance of community \nembeddedness, Task Shifting implicitly encourages the implementation of \nCHW programs with medically competent CHWs who may be unable to \nperform their designated socially oriented tasks. Our literature review \nsuggests that without a community focus the likelihood of CHW program \nsuccess (i.e. CHW competence at both medically and socially oriented \ntasks) is severely reduced.   \nThe report\u2019s neglect of community embeddedness speaks directly \nto the broader change in the WHO\u2019s approach to primary health care in \nlow income countries. Between the late 1960s and early 1980s the WHO \ndeveloped a strong record of supporting community health initiatives and \nencouraging the devolution of power from medical professionals to \nmarginalized people. In 1978, the WHO and UNICEF put forward the Alma \nAta Declaration, which recognized the link between improved global \nhealth, primary healthcare, participation and community empowerment \n(Croetz 2004).  \nCommunity embeddedness (especially through community \nparticipation) was considered vital to ensure projects were supported on \nthe ground, were responsive to the perceived needs of local people, and \n24  C. Campbell & K. Scott    \n \nwould be sustainable (Croetz 2004). Moreover, it was argued that people \nwould change their health compromising behaviours if they were involved \nin exploring the consequences of these behaviours (Rifkin 1996). Through \nparticipation, marginalized people would gain the skills, confidence and \nresources necessary to gain control over their own lives and challenge the \nstructures that oppressed them (Rifkin 1996).  \nIn its Technical Report Series document on CHWs in 1989, the \nWHO enshrined its support for community embeddedness and control in \nits definition of the CHW:   \n \nCommunity health workers should be members \nof the communities where they work, should be \nselected by the communities, should be \nanswerable to the communities for their \nactivities, should be supported by the health \nsystem but not necessarily a part of its \norganization, and have shorter training than \nprofessional workers.  \n \nThe WHO advocated that community participation be meaningful by \npushing for increased citizen control over decisions and resources.  \nHowever, by the end of the 1990s the WHO had undergone a \nfundamental shift in focus.  The organization moved from the Alma Ata \nRetreat from Alma Ata?  25 \napproach, which emphasized comprehensive primary health care, socially \noriented CHW programs and community participation to selective primary \nhealth care which prioritized targeted, technical solutions and the \npromotion of biomedical expertise (Grodos and De Bethune 1988, Rifkin & \nWalt 1986, Peterson & Swartz 2002, Litsios 2002, Lawn et al. 2008). \nNow, in 2008, it appears the WHO continues to prioritize a \ntechnical, biomedical approach to health.  One can scour Task Shifting \nand find no meaningful discussion of community embeddedness or \nparticipation. A prime example of this retreat from Alma Ata is the Task \nSharing document\u2019s definition of CHWs (compared to the WHO\u2019s 1989 \ndefinition). They now state that a CHW is: \n \nA health worker who has received training that \nis outside the nursing and midwifery medical \ncurricula but is, nevertheless, standardized and \nnationally endorsed. This category can include \nhealth workers with a range of different roles \nand competencies and those that are providing \nessential services in a health facility, or in the \ncommunity as part of, or linked to, a health \nteam at a facility (WHO 2008a, p. 79). \n \n26  C. Campbell & K. Scott    \n \nCHWs are now only discussed in terms of their shorter training \ntimes and linkages to the health system. There is no mention of \ncommunity involvement in their selection and accountability. \nConsultation is the closest the WHO gets to mentioning community \nembeddedness in Task Shifting.  It is largely presented as a tool to bring \nlocals on-side with pre-determined program goals and structures. Under \nrecommendation 2, which encourages consultation with stakeholders, the \nWHO suggests: \n \nCommunity sensitization and education of \nservice users will also be needed to help task \nshifting find acceptance among people living \nwith HIV\/AIDS and others with common unmet \nhealth-care needs, the health workforce and \nthe general public (WHO 2008a, p. 16).  \n \nCommunity members are presented as passive objects of the \nhealth sector. They are to be engaged with only to encourage their \nacceptance of the expert-driven task shifting agenda. There is no space \nfor the \u201cgeneral public\u201d (notably not called the community) to control any \nelement of task shifting. The only option is to accept. \nWhere does the debate between comprehensive and selective \nprimary health care stand now, in early 2009? It seems there are two \nRetreat from Alma Ata?  27 \nschools of thought: one which has moved away from the complicated, \npoliticized Alma Ata goals with a return to seeing health as a technical \nissue and another that seeks to hold on to the early emphasis on \ncommunity and social change.   \nWe posit that health problems underscored by socially determined \nfactors (such as behaviour, stigma, and attitudes), cannot be addressed \nsolely by technical solutions. Socially oriented tasks such as promoting \nbehaviour change, discussing stigma, and education about health are \nvital. Programs with the conditions in place to increase CHWs\u2019 ability to \nperform socially oriented tasks will play a greater role in illness prevention, \ncommunity mobilization and social change than programs emphasizing \ntechnical solutions. CHW programs arising from Task Shifting will be \nunlikely to address the social components of health. \nMany might argue that in light of the desperate state of healthcare \nin developing countries coping with HIV\/AIDS, a program that simply \nimplements medical solutions is sufficient. One might further argue that \nsetting up the community embeddedness necessary for CHWs to perform \ntheir socially oriented tasks is too difficult and resource intensive to \nconcern the WHO at this stage of the HIV epidemic. In response to these \ncontentions, we suggest that CHW interventions without the ability for \nCHWs to perform socially oriented tasks focus will be ineffective in \npreventing future infection with HIV. Without behaviour change promotion \n28  C. Campbell & K. Scott    \n \nthrough socially oriented work such as discussion, stigma reduction and \neducation, HIV will continue to spread.  \nWhile it is crucial to expand the health work force by training new, \ntechnically competent workers, Task Shifting preemptively and \nunnecessarily limits itself by taking failing to encourage the community \nembeddedness necessary to support CHWs at their socially oriented \ntasks. The WHO\u2019s Task Shifting focuses on the short term approach to \ntackling HIV, specifically through the provision of medical care.  \n \nConclusion \nThis paper has critically evaluated the WHO\u2019s 2008 Task Shifting \nagainst two standards: First, how well does it account for lessons learned \nfrom past CHW programs? And second, how far can CWH programs, as \nenvisioned by Task Shifting, go towards addressing the HIV epidemic in \nlow income countries? We have argued that the WHO has drafted a \nproposal for CHW programs that, while accounting for some lessons from \nthe past, overlooks a fundamental one. Task Shifting has not accounted \nfor the importance of community embeddedness, despite it being most \nfrequently cited as the most important determinant of program success. \nStrategies outlined by Task Shifting will go far towards meeting the \nmedical goals of the WHO report. However the WHO has also assigned \nCHW a large number of socially oriented goals, such as community based \nHIV education. Without greater community embeddedness, the ability of \nRetreat from Alma Ata?  29 \nCHWs to tackle the social goals will be considerably limited. If the WHO is \nserious about these social goals, then they need to pay much greater \nattention the challenge of involving communities.  \n \n \nReferences  \n \nAbbatt, F. 2005.
