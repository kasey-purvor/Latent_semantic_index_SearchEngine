This essay reflects on a contrasting response from the Welsh \npoet David Jones which challenges the \u2018Rime\u2019 for a theological incoherence \nin itself constituting a failure of imagination, and then considers the relation of \nlanguage to liturgy in recent postmodern theology.  What emerges from \nColeridge\u2019s poem is a divergence between the identical repetition of the tale \nitself and a \u2018repetition with difference\u2019 implied in the Mariner\u2019s vision of a \nprocession to the kirk.  Coleridge\u2019s \u2018Gothic\u2019 imagination can do little more \nthan stage this difference of repetition on the margins of his poem, but there \nare implications for his later writing career, as he moves away from the \npredominance of imagination towards the counter-horizons of speculative \ntheological prose. (Word length: 5475) \n \n \nThe Ancient Mariner is not good at finishing: it offers both a weak formal conclusion \nand a tale presented as only one of many tellings.  The restless self-repetition of the \nMariner\u2019s story, together with his more marginal but equally unaccomplished \nprocession to the kirk \u2018in a goodly company\u2019 are not innocent forms of open-\nendedness so much as fraught modes of incompletion.  The desire for consummation, \nfor completeness and arrival, is doubly skewed within the poem: though telling the \ntale brings temporary relief and perhaps changes it in some way (though we have no \nmeans of telling), it is destined to be summoned up once again at that \u2018uncertain hour\u2019 \nwhich will compel the Mariner to repeat it, when it will once more consume narrative \nspace and time without being able to tell what exactly it is a narrative of.  Or so we as \nreaders assume.  We don\u2019t actually know whether the Mariner is telling us the truth of \nhow his tale convulses him with the need to repeat it, and we easily forget that this \nclaim (which we do take seriously) occurs as part of the same weak or Christianising \nconclusion we tend not to take seriously.  The founding narrative repetition \ncompulsion is not in itself wholly central to the ballad as we have it, but is \ndistinctively offset by the Mariner\u2019s wish to walk in company to the kirk, so as to \nparticipate in another narrative with, potentially, another mode of interminability. \nI want to suggest that here we find two incompatible, asymmetrically intertwined \nmodes of repetition, the one wholly compulsive and the other equally incompletable \nthough perhaps in terms of a different dispensation.  On the one hand, we have the \nMariner\u2019s narrative which is an unreclaimable history because it rests so narrowly on \nhis own repetition compulsion which seems to offer no outcome or continuation.  The \nneed to re-proclaim his trauma returns intermittently, as a sort of visitation, but during \nthe times of momentary release and relief another visitational mode is glimpsed, the \nprocession to the kirk, suggesting a more benign repetition with difference, a \ncelebrative participation in time and community.  This latter path eludes the main \nbody of the tale and lingers at a margin, one widely seen by critics as weak and \nconciliatory, but it allows the earlier devastating experience of identical repetition to \nbe echoed by difference, with the glimpse that compulsion on its own does not in fact \ninfill the entire space of the poem. \nIn a post-metaphysical age the theme of repetition has had its own contorted \nnarrative, one which proclaims an excess of horizontal time, but also the possibility of \nradical renewal or even transcendence.  For Kierkegaard, who initiates the series, \nrepetition is a radical transition tasked with the need to evade Hegelian mediation; for \nNietzsche it is the thought of eternal return; in Freud it is an uncanny compulsion, \nwhile with Derrida it is the founding trace of iterability and for Deleuze a virtuality of \nthe new inherent in the past.  The burden of such theories is that they presuppose a \ntriumph of nihilism.  It is with this in mind that theological writers like John Milbank \nand Catherine Pickstock have attempted to renew the Kierkegaardian understanding \n 2\nof repetition by once more de-secularising it, so that what they see as a repetition with \ndifference is not a punitive interruption but a participation in the divine life where \ndifferences belong together rather than being warring clans; for Pickstock in \nparticular, such a repetition, freed from what Milbank has called the ontological \nviolence of nihilism, is an indicator of liturgy and liturgical language.2\nTheological attempts at reading of The Ancient Mariner have a chequered history, \nthough in some ways they remain the poem\u2019s contested paradigm.  R.P. Warren\u2019s \nfamous essay entitled \u2018A Poem of Pure Imagination\u2019 first published over fifty years \nago galvanised energies for an entire generation, though left a preponderantly \nnegative legacy.3  Warren asserted the coherence of The Ancient Mariner\u2019s themes \nwith \u2018Coleridge\u2019s basic theological and philosophical views as given us in sober \nprose\u2019;4 apart from what that assumes about Coleridge\u2019s own variable rhetorics of \nfrenzy or sobriety as distributed across different genres of writing, Warren is surely \nright to insist that Coleridge\u2019s later theological preoccupations are one of the horizons \nof the poem, no less because of that poem\u2019s resistance to them.  Warren argued for an \ninterpenetration of the vision of a sacramental life with the theme of imagination, and \nalthough the majority of readings reacting to his essay see the actual poem as \nexceeding or subverting these categories, it is more difficult to deny them altogether, \narising as they do as part of the poem\u2019s troubled intentions.  There is no straight-\nforward subversive logic to be extracted from the Rime\u2019s perplexities.  As untidy \nextrapolation occurring both within and beyond the poem, the symbolic articulates the \nshadows of what the poem was trying to become as well as illuminating its blockages.  \nThis is also to hint at trajectories by which the poem tries to leave itself behind.  \nIt can be forgotten that Warren himself saw the killing of the albatross as \nmotiveless; it is precisely because it re-enacts the sinful alienation of the Fall that it \n 3\ncannot be a calculated murder but opens up a chain of consequences, at once \ndeterministic but open to a sacramental mediation of determination.5  This sets the \nscene for what is seen as the orthodox Christian response, whereby the tale is one of a \nhalting progress from sin to repentance, though it has never escaped notice that only a \nvery limited repentance seems able to penetrate the Gothicizing fabric of the poem.6  \nWarren admitted that large areas of the poem were irrelevant to the \u2018sacramental \nbusiness\u2019, as well as noting other, more recalcitrant symbolic binaries such as the sun \nand moon, or winds and storms.7  He also notes the chief kernel of resistance: that \nthough the Mariner brings salvation he cannot quite save himself, and his wandering \nis something less than the mark of a blessed vision.8  One might summarize that the \nMariner\u2019s yearning for pilgrimage, at its most intense when he fantasises being part of \na procession to the kirk, never actually escapes the condition of a rootless nomadism.  \nEarly opponents of Warren were quick to point out that Coleridge\u2019s poem is as much \nhaunted by punitive, capricious or irrational aspects of the universe.9\nIt seems clear, however, that The Ancient Mariner isn\u2019t in the business of shoring \nup a fundamentalist Christianity, however primordial that poem\u2019s sense of guilt and \npossible redemption.  Indeed, the apparent depth of guilt and the seeming weakness of \nredemption are not without theological significance, seen in the context of a transition \nfrom experience to the horizons of that experience.  There is a definite sense that \nColeridge\u2019s ballad, however nightmarish, spurred on its author\u2019s attempts to interpret \nthe world in the teeth of resistances.  That very trauma, marginally in the poem but \nmore extensively in his later writing career, was to provoke theological researches \ninto possible differences of outcome and aftermath, a sense of truth arising from the \nwill restored by a faith in \u2018Reason\u2019, though that sense proved unable to suspend the \nself-incarceration within experience except intermittently.  Given the possibility of \n 4\nsuch a view, I would partly go along with Raimonda Modiano\u2019s reading of The \nAncient Mariner, in the course of which she argues that the sacred is only introduced \ninto the poem through violence.  Though the slaying of the albatross is a fundamental \nsacrifice, the poem as a whole subverts any sacrificial economy, she asserts.10  The \ncycle of violence unleashed gives us not so much sacramental vision as a sacrificial \ncrisis together with an erasure of the distinction between the sacred and profane, \nblessing or alienation.11  As a Girardian reading of the The Ancient Mariner, this is in \npart already a theological one.  It is not the business of Coleridge\u2019s poem to exemplify \nany theological motif, but in its very un-innocence before experience and disorder it \npresents the existential material out of which its own marginalised and tentative \ntheological self-reading can begin.  In one sense, the poetry doesn\u2019t \u2018hear\u2019 this \nreading; its own traumatic invasion by repetition has no such horizon of possibility \nwithin the space of narrative.  But that space is not co-extensive with the poem as a \nwhole; given the need for the poem as a poem to finish somewhere, it paradoxically \nglimpses another mode of the incompletable by which it begins to walk away from \nitself.  The Mariner who parts from the Wedding Guest also dreams of quitting his \nown psychic scene. \nAs secular metaphor we can see how easily the idea of symbolism comes to grief \nwithin the textural fabric of the poem,12 at once so bruised and arbitrary, an apparent \nsite for what Milbank calls ontological violence which can be read as the \ngroundlessness of human life constituting an abyss rather than participation in the life \nof God.13  Poetic text is not identical to poetic texture, however: the latter term \nsolicits consideration of the relative density or translucence of the poetic materia, and \nalso of the implied horizons before which any narrative itself must give out and where \nthe status of repetition becomes paramount.  If theology fails the dynamic of The \n 5\nAncient Mariner, we might nonetheless ask: to what extent can that poem offer itself \nup to theological judgment and contemplate as part of itself its own theological \nfailings? \nII \nOne essay which takes up that challenge is by the Anglo-Welsh poet and artist-\nengraver David Jones, who published an introduction to a new edition of his copper \nengraving illustrations of The Ancient Mariner in 1964, the year in which another \npoet-critic, William Empson, declared the poem to be a deliberate \u2018parody of the \ntraditional struggle for atonement\u2019.14  Jones too had problems with the poem but from \na very different perspective.  As a Modernist influenced by Eliot\u2019s theory of the \ndissociation of sensibility, he had limited sympathy for Romanticism as such, but had \nfound himself continually going back to Coleridge\u2019s poem.  The essay is little read by \nColeridgeans (with the exception of David Jasper)15 and lies outside the academic \nmainstream.  It has some cogent points to make, however, not least in that it offers \ntheological judgment rather than Christian assimilation.  For Jones the greater the \npoetic genius, the more we should probe for possible significances in every line.  \nCoupled with that was his overriding respect for an exact disciplina of fidelity to \ncontingent fact.  His general interpretation of the poem is similar to Warren\u2019s, seeing \nthe Mariner\u2019s unconscious act of praise at the sight of the water-snakes as the crux of \nthe piece, finding the theology faultless: \u2018for all are agreed that the prayer of praise far \nexcels that of petition\u2019.16  But Jones wouldn\u2019t have agreed with Warren or the earlier \nColeridge that Original Sin is not hereditary but a fallen condition of the will, though \nColeridge appears to have been already revising his view of Original Sin as early as \nMarch, 1798, while he was still working on the Rime.17  Jones is clear that the poem \nnarrates a primordial, mostly pagan tradition of ordeal, rather than a specifically \n 6\nredemptive journey.  The tutelary spirit which presides over the Antarctic demands a \nkind of wergeld in satisfaction for the wrong committed against a creature under his \nguardianship: \u2018The man hath penance done, \/ And penance more will do\u2019 (ll. 413-14), \nas one of the Polar Spirit\u2019s two fellow daemons observes.18  Jones\u2019 reading is acutely \nsensitive to the role of the various supernatural powers in the Rime, and he celebrates \nwhat he calls the \u2018seraphic exactitude\u2019 which takes the ship as far as the Line but not \none nautical mile beyond.19  That the heavenly Curia neither abruptly nor wholly \nassumes power from the local Numen Jones finds a moving moment of celestial \ncourtesy, though shrewdly notes that what appears moving here is also \u2018unvoiced and \nperhaps not meant\u2019.20  This accords with Raimonda Modiano\u2019s sense of how The \nAncient Mariner calls into question any single centre of divine activity by introducing \na proliferation of spirits;  her quoting from Pierre Bayle\u2019s Dictionary entry for Cain in \nthis context would have strongly appealed to David Jones\u2019 antiquarian interests.  \nModiano picks up Bayle\u2019s sense that evil actions may be the consequence of the sport \nof some whimsical supernatural agency,21 and Jones for his part finds a \u2018slight whiff \nof idiotic\u2026excitement\u2019 in the game of chance in Part III which gives the victory to \nLife-in-Death as a chooser-of-the-slain figure from some far-off Teutonic or Celtic \ncult, wryly noting that \u2018We all deteriorate, we all lose our looks, and of nothing is this \nmore true than the figures of a discredited cult\u2019.22\nFascinated as Jones is with the Mariner as an avatar of residual or decaying cults \nwhich maintain their psychological impact, he meets head-on what for him is the \noverwhelming problem within a poem which might otherwise claim to be the spiritual \nheir of the Celtic wonder-voyage.  He notes that the vessel of ecclesia, the voyaging \nof the Church through time, was a favourite type for the Greek and Latin Fathers.23  \nHowever, the moment the Mariner steps back on shore and desires absolution from \n 7\nthe anchorite, this becomes for Jones an episode that can no longer be dissociated \nfrom what he calls \u2018the ordinary processes of contrition, confession, absolution, \npenance.24  Jones sees that \u2018for \u201cpenance\u201d we must read \u201cordeal\u201d, and for Christian \nconfessor, we have to substitute some agent of the gods placing a fate upon a mortal\u2019.  \nJones is quick to add that \u2018we never can, of course, quite manage this\u2019, standing as we \ndo within the Christian tradition, where the motif of shriving invokes or provokes that \ntradition.25  His reading takes particular exception to Coleridge\u2019s 1817 gloss \nexplaining how, once the Mariner has been shriven, \u2018the penance of life falls on him\u2019, \nto which Jones will retort that it is \u2018no part of the job of those who administer this \nsacrament to impose compulsion-neuroses under the guise of penances, so we are \nfaced with a flat travesty of a sacrament\u2019.26  Jones can only assume that Coleridge, for \nall his erudition, was imperceptive of the implications of pastoral theology, or, worse, \nthat he \u2018disregarded what he knew in the interests of the schema of his poem\u2019.27  In \nJones\u2019 view no artist is at liberty to distort what he has chosen as part of his materia \npoetica, which leaves us with a poem which has apparently traduced itself in order to \npurvey its high Gothicism, or one  too slack to do justice to the real theological crux it \nhas broached. \nWhether we see this as a na\u00efve or antiquarian reading matters less than this salutary \nchallenge (from someone equally committed to the poetic process) to the poem\u2019s own \nautonomy.  Perhaps for Jones part of the solution to interpreting The Ancient Mariner \nis to draw it into a larger domain of writing which no longer privileges its aesthetic \nuniqueness, or rather values the aesthetic precisely where it makes for linkages with \nthe mysterious.  And for Coleridge the writer it was precisely these internal blockages \nwithin the allegorical logic of his poem which called to be explored further or \notherwise in his later career.  Such divergences are already present in principle, of \n 8\ncourse, along the \u2018weak\u2019 post- or counter-narrative margins of the poem as we have it.  \nWhat is the status of the \u2018penance more\u2019, the compulsive repetition, which the \nMariner must undergo?  Is it, as Jones argued, an unredemptive ordeal of ceaseless \nwandering, or can it be, that the \u2018more\u2019 of penance involves, not just a thorn in the \nflesh, but a difference of outcome for a burden not otherwise relieved?28\nThis poetic blockage which is simultaneously a highly charged narrative is for \nreaders the predominant experience of The Ancient Mariner.  As Modiano says, just \nas the Wedding Guest is stunned by the Mariner\u2019s tale, so the Mariner is stunned by \nhis own act of violence, one disconnected from himself and ultimately \nincomprehensible.29  A number of critics note that the Mariner\u2019s own burden is \nambivalent, that even before curse or blessing there may be a layer of wish-\nfulfilment.30  Repetition in the finite mind of the eternal I AM turns out to be not so \nmuch creative participation as a blasphemous, usurping self-assertion on the part of \nthe human.31  The Rime may be itself a fable of the consequences of a fascination \nwith art, usurpation being the principal motif in the events described.  The tale of \nitself usurps the Mariner in its demand for repetition, so that there is no end to \nanswering the Hermit\u2019s \u2018What manner man art thou?\u201932  This very question might beg \nanother, the greatest usurpation of all, if the Mariner were to answer \u2018Who do you say \nthat I am?\u2019, but not only is he a failed Christ, his request for redemption out of his \nown experience also seems to fail, though we might also note here that where all \nhuman resources fail this can be characterised by Kierkegaard as the onset of a \ngenuine repetition.33  It looks very much as though the Rime gets stuck at an aesthetic \nand ethical repetition, valuing a poetic word which can never sufficiently disburden \nitself to be open to a religious silence, the sole authentic mode of repetition. \nEnthralment to a force which has sway over life and death is equally an enthralment \n 9\nwhich traps death within life, in other words an identical repetition, the inability to \nboth die and renew life throughout time. 34   The Mariner\u2019s story offers no redemptive \nhorizon of its own, though this is less a denial of Christianity than an internal lack \nwithin a narrative which feels unaided by any stronger margin other than its own \ncompelling narrative drive. \nThat the Mariner\u2019s tale exhibits compulsive or identical repetition has long been \nacknowledged by criticism.  David Bunyan speculates that what is uncanny in \nrepetition is that it forces an unwanted unification upon a disoriented mind, one which \nis regressive and unbidden.  So it is the repetition as such, not the content of that \nrepetition, which is the source of anxiety.35  This would render repetition as a \npeculiarly threatening mode of incompletability.  According to Brown, for Paul de \nMan repetition amounts to a repetition of difference rather than one with difference, so \nthere can be no therapeutic reworking of a memory simply the signifier of anteriority \nas such.  Though, as Brown points out, the arbitrary in the Rime is inherently \nambivalent, because the arbitrary also arbitrates, so that what is external or \nextraneous is no less internally determinative.36  Bunyan reminds us that the nature of \nrepetition is enigmatic, as Freud acknowledged.  Why repeat?  The Lacanian answer \nis that repetition staunches a gap, forecloses upon an absence, however futile the \ndevice is felt to be in itself, a vain attempt to internalise a power of experience greater \nthan any sense of self.37  For Bunyan the repetition compulsion also gives rise to an \ninterpretive compulsion, the attempt to domesticate the text by somehow repeating it \nin one\u2019s own voice, which is Coleridge\u2019s founding fantasy as its originator.  Within \nthat frame the Mariner attempts to re-voice his own tale as a source of inward \nmeaning, and so lays across his history a veneer of Christian symbolism.38  At this \npoint I part company with Bunyan\u2019s penetrating analysis.  Within the Rime we have \n 10\nnot just one of many supposed versions of the Mariner\u2019s story, but also the \ndistinctively weak aftermath which opens up the possibility of a repetition with \ndifference, the walk to the kirk, even from within the temporary abeyance of the \nrepetition compulsion itself. \nThe judgment of Modiano\u2019s analysis is that the Mariner, beginning his journey \ndistrusting any compatibility between Christian symbolism and the world of spiritual \ndesolation actually encountered, ends up constructing a narrative which circumscribes \nterror within the framework of conventional Christian beliefs.39  By this process the \nMariner \u2018cannibalizes\u2019 himself as once he had sucked his own blood, becoming the \nsacrificial victim of the tale which must ever begin anew from a zero point of initial \nviolent fracture.40  Modiano here assigns a central role to what John Milbank claims \nis derived from a quasi-sacrificial ontological violence, the sudden breaking in of an \nabyss which can never be appeased.  And Catherine Pickstock argues that such an \nunmediable difference is coincident with indifference, an absolute equivalence which \nmediates each difference after all.  The primacy of death in the postmodern order \nrepeats the hegemony of the homogeneous within modernity itself: nothing is more \nidentical than nothing is to nothing.  The claim there can only be death amounts to a \nclaim there can only be identical repetition.41  Pickstock can be accused of failing to \nacknowledge here that within the nothing might lurk an indeterminate reserve not \nidentical to the nihil, or that there is also an affirmative darkness within the \npostmodern; she is surely correct, however, to charge the more terroristic side of \npostmodernism with an insouciance, or with too complacent a sublimity in the face of \nnihilism. \nBoth Milbank and Pickstock offer a strong counter-model, that of repetition with \ndifference, derived in part from Robert Lowth\u2019s eighteenth century reading of Hebrew \n 11\npoetry (in effect the Old Testament) through the figure of pleonasm, or repetition with \nvariety.  Milbank claims this as an anticipation of Derridian supplementarity, but \nuntinged by the abyss of the arche-trace.42  For both Milbank and Pickstock it is \nwriting which spatializes or fixes the onto-theological rather than the inherent orality \nof poetic rhythm which they see as the originary pulsing and active passing-on of \ntime.43  This opens the possibility that the Mariner\u2019s act not only provokes an abyss \n(which at the level of the narrative it certainly does) but that it also encounters a \ntranscendent horizon (which in the sheer desire for relief from narrative repetition it \nmay well do). \nPickstock\u2019s work intends a liturgical turn as a revision of the linguistic turn.  \nMilbank explains it thus: since God is not an item in the world to which we might turn \n(which could be taken to say God is not the sum of our experience of the world), he is \nonly first there for us in our turning to him, a turn entirely contingent and cultural.44  \nFor the Mariner the divine is not the meaning of his tale but the meaning from, or out \nof, his tale, the horizon of becoming which implicitly, and in a distinct mode of \nweakness, accompanies it.  Pickstock declares the mystery of the liturgical to be a \nwitness that we only turn to God when he reaches us, by which liturgy comes to be a \nmore fundamental domain than either language or experience, though it remains in \nitself both linguistic and experiential.45  It is not pure revision, therefore, but \nanalogous to origin, the fore-intention of the originary which is at one with it \nthroughout a performable series.  The person who praises, who walks in a goodly \ncompany, is un-estranged but does not thereby claim a fixed identity.46\nO sweeter than the Marriage-feast \n\u2018Tis sweeter far to me \n 12\nTo walk together to the Kirk \nWith a goodly company. \nTo walk together to the Kirk \nAnd all together pray\u2026   (ll. 634-39) \n \nThese familiar lines themselves enact the incremental redundancy of walking to the \nkirk, a repetition which extends the idea of a goodly company to the idea of a praying \none.  This choric desire provides a weak frame for the Mariner\u2019s own narrative, but it \nis not so much a containment as the open horizon of that very tale\u2019s desire, the \nMariner\u2019s aspiration to take his tale on a walk no longer identical to its internal logic, \nbut perhaps capable of re-contextualising or supplementing it.  In the Rime this \naspiration is not itself fully narratable, has no actual singular history of its own, but is \ncertainly constitutive for Coleridge\u2019s history when he comes to repeat the Mariner\u2019s \nordeals as his own act of writing.  For Pickstock the liturgical non-place is always \nalready situated in God who exceeds the world.47  The liturgical rite is a series of \nrecommencements, a song for the occasion of a journey or the threshold of a \ndestination, not a final closure.  This is no longer a pure anterior essence (an easy \ntarget for a De Manian deconstruction of nostalgia), but rather that which is both \nbefore and after, repeated with difference.48  The Eucharistic liturgy in particular is a \npartial imparting, a mode between presence and absence which allows all signs to \nbecome con-celebratory according to their own natures.49  This partiality, this being \non behalf of from within partialness, offers a richer way of reading the unstable and \nless than coherent symbolism of The Ancient Mariner, a symbolism which does \nnonetheless have a function.  Here, I believe, Warren was correct, though he \ncategorised the symbolic configurations too rigidly, but does acknowledge what he \n 13\nhimself calls \u2018a repetition with a difference\u2019 when describing the ambivalence of the \nmoon imagery between Part III and Part IV.  This difference traces a movement \nwithin the Mariner from unregeneracy to regeneracy, a proto-liturgical movement of \nturning towards and finding the moon present in a different way.50  Analogous \nidentity is always transcendent for Pickstock, so there is always more to come, it is \neternity (as it was for Kierkegaard) which is true repetition.51  The Mariner\u2019s own \nburdened prophecy calls for relief at the horizon of an other-constituted community, \nless as a corrective norm than as a supplementary space within which his words might \nunravel differently, might find continuation rather than blockage.  Liturgy so \nunderstood by Pickstock is an assurance that all our past actions don\u2019t exceed what is \ngoing to happen: it establishes rather than erases the possibility of action.  And \nevening, the vesper time, is the liturgical moment, a time when diurnal human action \nis made redundant in the diminishing light, giving place to a vulnerable time of \nmaximal exchange between heaven and earth, a time which, as Pickstock says, \nensures than prayer introducing the ensuing \u2018day\u2019 becomes a gateway to time itself.52  \nThis is the moment for a positive, differentiating but un-analysable proportionality \nbetween time and eternity.53  The alteration of character through time which the \nworshipper (or would-be worshipper in the Mariner\u2019s case) undergoes is not \ndissipation into a nihilistic explosion of differences where connections and \nresemblances count as nothing.  The subject is not separated from its position in the \nworld; rather, there is a perpetual fulfilling of the very possibility of character in and \nthrough a transfiguring of the world as such.54  Drawing on Saint Augustine\u2019s \nunderstanding of knowledge as rooted in desire, radical orthodox theology reads the \neroticism of our existence as iconic: desire directs us to God.55  Knowledge of God is \nmediated by an eschatologically in-formed materiality, one essentially mediated via \n 14\nan ecclesial body;56 it is just this which the Mariner longs to be able to affirm on the \nmargins of his tale.  For him God has been the icon of a desire his action collided with \nand usurped; another way of putting this is to suggest his implicit desire for God \noverruns his capacity to represent God to himself or provokes an iconoclastic \noutburst, until he discovers within a renewed hunger for liturgy that God exceeds that \nparticular abyss also.  The abyss so opened glimpses a further opening-out, until \nabandonment is crossed by a tracing of the plenitude of becoming. \nAm I claiming that a fragmentary liturgical wish or meta-episode on the margins of \nthe Rime effectively converts it to a Christian poem?  The Ancient Mariner is by no \nmeans a poem which achieves blessing on its own terms, going little further than to \ngesture towards what I\u2019ve characterised as a \u2018weak\u2019 trace of otherness on the margins \nof its ruling compulsion.  The poetry as such remains encapsulated within its own \nliterary Gothicism, within a speculative narrative frisson which attains neither closure \nnor real denouement.  The poem\u2019s ruling motive as it \u201ccrosses the line\u201d leads to no \nresolution, and the complex horizon of a weak conclusion can only hint at a further \nnarrative.  The two modes of repetition do achieve divergence, nonetheless, while \nremaining wholly unequal within that divergence.  The afterlife of The Ancient \nMariner continued to haunt and possess Coleridge, and though not intended as \npersonal allegory he was increasingly prepared to let it become so.57  The sense that \nhis life was progressively writing itself into the fabric of the Rime was nowhere more \nacute than during the Malta period of 1804-6, a time when his imagination became \nliterally more maritime; it may be no coincidence that this was also the period of \nColeridge\u2019s emergent Trinitarianism, the turn from a defensively rationalist theology \nto a consciously more mysterious, and perhaps more existential one.  At this period \nalso the Notebooks can highlight a search for sympathy, one which was eventually to \n 15\nbecome associated with a diseased will: a craving for sympathy at the root of self is \nanti-redemptive if it becomes the goal of self.58  At stake here is Coleridge\u2019s own \nimaginative elaboration (a possibly compromising one) of the restlessness of human \npersonality, but this brings with it a necessary sense of the ontological character of \nimagination, not least when the sheer intensification of experience confronts the \nproblem of evil.  Though the nature of that evil remains mysterious and not fully \nresolvable on the moral plane, nonetheless being a self requires transformation by \nanother.59  It is at this point that we might regard The Ancient Mariner as itself a sort \nof \u2018imaginary scripture\u2019,60 particularly in its post 1798 versions; we have the effect of \na simulated proof-text, one which glosses its own excess as a species of exemplum.  It \nis as though the full implications of the Rime can no longer be embodied in purely \npoetic terms but call not only for another \u2018voice\u2019 (the 1817 fictive editor) but \nultimately for a different form of writing.  In that light, the Mariner\u2019s espousal of the \ndelight of walking in company to the kirk is a nascent act of will (for the later \nColeridge the key to personality), a possible restitution of memory rather than a new \norder of experience itself. \nColeridge\u2019s long journey from his early poetic achievement to his later theological \nprose  is a complex overlapping of rhetorics and by no means a simple reversal or \nwithdrawal.  Religious language never ceases to be poetic discourse in Coleridge, and \nboth the poetry and the theological prose are implicated in a common rhetoric, the \ncreative urge to persuade.61  If Newman could fear Coleridge had reduced the concern \nfor religious truth to the effects of that truth imagined,62 he reckoned without the \ninterconnected multiplicity of Coleridge\u2019s writing practices and their implied \nbeckoning from one to another: already at the close of The Ancient Mariner an \nimaginative text chastens itself with an obliquely distinct rhetoric, one on the verge of \n 16\na language of purification and dedication, a poignant witness to the insufficiency of \nany self-identical vortex of imagination.  Such a germinal movement away from \nexcess persona towards a prayerful attentiveness seems to resonate with Coleridge\u2019s \nmuch later creative theorising of a divine \u2018personeity\u2019, itself the generator of alterity \nand community within the immanent Trinity.  For the Coleridge of the Opus \nMaximum and Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit divine personeity was the source of \ndistinction in unity, the emergence of alterity from a creative will rather than an \noppositional ground.63  And in Aids to Reflection Coleridge would argue not only for \na world revealing divine presence but for a world present to the divine, and it is this \nprocessional sense of towardness which skirts the Rime also.64  In the Opus Maximum \nit is only the fullness of the divine self which is \u2018wholly and adequately repeated\u2019 and \nit is that \u2018very repetition [which] contains the distinction from the primary act\u2019.65  \nOnly in aspiring toward the liturgical can the Mariner rediscover his own lostness, and \nfrom within a repetition echoing divine distinction and difference cease to centre that \nloss obsessively on his own self-narration.66\n \n \n                                                 \n1 Versions of this paper were given at the Coleridge Summer Conference, Cannington, July 2004, and \nat the \u2018Poetry and Belief\u2019 workshop at the University of Warwick, February 2005.

Robert Barth in response to this paper at the Coleridge Summer Conference, \nCannington, July 2004. In this context it is interesting to note that John Milbank argues the later \nmedieval stress on a regulatory discipline for recurrent sins is in fact a shift from the early Christian \nunderstanding of penance (something undertaken publicly once in a lifetime as part of a transferral to a \nsemi-religious form of life).

Stephen Long maintains that the argument that truth is contingent on language rather than \nmetaphysical, and therefore no more than the pure product of narrative, seems to denote an originary \nontological violence functioning like a transcendental condition for the possibility of knowledge, and \nno less problematically exceeding its own prescribed contingency.
