Introduction\n[2] The Antarctic-Arctic Radiation-belt (Dynamic)\nDeposition-VLF Atmospheric Research Konsortium\n(AARDDVARK) is a global network of radio receivers\ndesigned to make continuous long-range observations of\nthe lower ionosphere at mid to high-latitude regions. The\nnetwork of cheap, easy to install, easy to maintain sensors\nuse preexisting man-made very low frequency radio\nwaves (VLF) to detect changes in ionization levels from\n\u000130--90 km altitude, continuously, and with high time\nresolution. The network\u2019s goal is to increase the understand-\ning of energy coupling between the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the\nSun, and space. The part of the electromagnetic spectrum\ndescribed as VLF generally spans 3--30 kHz. Most ground-\nbased observations in the VLF band are dominated by the\nstrong impulsive signals radiated by lightning discharges.\nThese produce significant electromagnetic power froma few\nhertz to several hundredmegahertz [Magono, 1980], with the\nbulk of the energy radiated in the VLF frequency band. At\nVLF such pulses are termed \u2018\u2018atmospherics,\u2019\u2019 or simply\n\u2018\u2018sferics.\u2019\u2019 In addition to sferics, at frequencies >10 kHz\nman-made transmissions from communication and naviga-\ntion transmitters can be observed in almost every part of the\nworld.\n1Physical Sciences Division, British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge,\nUK.\n2Department of Physics, University of Otago, Dunedin, New\nZealand.\n3UltraMSK.com, Dunedin, New Zealand.\n4Sodankyla\u00a8 GeophysicalObservatory, University ofOulu, Sodankyla\u00a8,\nFinland.\n5Space Research Group, Eo\u00a8tvo\u00a8s University, Budapest, Hungary.\n6Hermanus Magnetic Obsevatory, Hermanus, South Africa.\n7School of Physics, University of KwaZulu Natal, Durban, South\nAfrica.\n8School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences and Cooperative\nResearch Centre for Satellite Systems, University of Newcastle,\nCallaghan, New South Wales, Australia.\n9Earth Observation, Finnish Meteorological Institute, Helsinki,\nFinland.\nSPACE WEATHER, VOL. 7, S04001, doi:10.1029\/2008SW000412, 2009\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union 1 of 15S04001\n[3] Most of the energy radiated by man-made VLF\ntransmitters is trapped between the conducting ground\n(land, sea, or ice) and the lower part of the ionosphere,\nforming the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. Such radiation\nis said to be propagating \u2018\u2018subionospherically,\u2019\u2019 i.e.,\nbeneath the ionosphere. At wavelengths of about 15 km\n(\u000120 kHz) all the antennas are electrically short and\ntherefore have low-radiation efficiency. However, opera-\ntionally this is compensated for by having very high input\npowers, making these transmitters expensive to run. As a\nresult the creation and operation of man-made VLF trans-\nmitters is generally due to military requirements. Never-\ntheless, the scientific use of the transmissions from these\nstations has a long and successful history. Following the\ninvention of radio wave transmission and reception\n[Popov, 1896] Heaviside and Kennelly [Kennelly, 1902]\npostulated the existence of what we now know as the\nionosphere in order to explain the observed reflection of\nradio waves. Using a technique developed by Hollingworth\n[1926] of making VLF recordings as a function of range,\nVLF transmitter signals were shown to exhibit an inter-\nference pattern, which could be compared with theoretical\nestimates [Weeks, 1950]. In the subionospheric waveguide\nthe upper and lower boundaries strongly affect the prop-\nagation conditions for the VLF waves. As the conducting\nground (land, sea, or ice) is essentially unchanging with\ntime it is the upper boundary that drives most of the\ntemporal variability in the amplitude and phase of man-\nmade transmitters observed from a distant location. The\nupper boundary of the waveguide is the ionized D region\nat \u000170--85 km, and shows variations caused by local\nchanges in ionization rates at altitudes below the D region\ncaused by space weather events. During undisturbed\nconditions the amplitude and phase of fixed frequency\nVLF transmissions varies in a consistent way and thus\nspace weather events can be detected as deviations from\nthe \u2018\u2018quiet day curve.\u2019\u2019 For a much more comprehensive\nreview of this topic we refer the reader to the discussion\nby Barr et al. [2000] which highlights the development of\nVLF radio wave propagation measurements particularly\nover the last 50 years.\n[4] In order to interpret any observed fluctuations in a\nreceived VLF signal it is necessary to reproduce the\ncharacteristics of the deviations using mathematical\ndescriptions of VLF wave propagation [e.g., Sommerfeld,\n1909; Budden, 1955; Wait, 1963], and thus determine the\nionization changes that have occurred around the upper\nwaveguide boundary. This was the challenge during the\nearly days of the subject. Some 50 years ago the early work\nof Piggott et al. [1965] and Pitteway [1965] focused on\nobservations from single frequency radio links between\nRugby and Cambridge, UK, for example, those observa-\ntions made by Bracewell et al. [1951] and Straker [1955]. One\nsuccessful approach of the time was to determine the D\nregion electron concentration altitude profile using a\nsystematic application of trial and error in order to repro-\nduce the observations [e.g., Hollingworth, 1926; Deeks\n1966a, 1966b]. This approach worked best with observa-\ntions at many frequencies and transmitters sites, and\nmany receiving sites in order to determine the spatial\nstructure, and electron concentration altitude profile of\nthe ionization enhancement region. Essentially this\napproach is still used today, where ionization effects on\nVLF wave propagation can be modeled using powerful\nprograms such as the Long Wave Propagation Code\n(LWPC) [Ferguson and Snyder, 1990]. LWPC models VLF\nsignal propagation from any point on Earth to any other\npoint. Given electron density profile parameters for the\nupper boundary conditions, LWPC calculates the expected\namplitude and phase of the VLF signal at the reception\npoint. The code models the variation of geophysical\nparameters along the path as a series of horizontally\nhomogeneous segments. To do this, the program deter-\nmines the ground conductivity, dielectric constant, orien-\ntation of the geomagnetic field with respect to the path\nand the solar zenith angle, at small fixed distance intervals\nalong the path. Given electron density profile parameters\nfor the upper boundary conditions for each section along\nthe path, LWPC calculates the expected amplitude and\nphase of the VLF signal at the reception point. Thus it can\nbe used to investigate the modification of the ionosphere\nduring precipitation events driven by space weather,\ncharacterizing the electron density profile produced by\nthe precipitating particles. A limitation of this technique is\nin the inability to determine if all, or if only part of, a\ntransmitter-receiver path is affected by the precipitating\nparticles. This can be overcome by using multiple, cross-\ning paths, and data from other instruments (such as\nriometers) or satellite observations.\n[5] Although much work has previously been done in\nthis area of science, and many observations of space\nweather effects have been interpreted using data collected\nover many years, we now have the advantage of direct\nsatellite observations of the conditions occurring in the\nradiation belts, magnetosphere, and even close to the Sun,\nin addition to powerful VLF modeling capabilities. Thus\nwe are able to use in situ, single-point satellite measure-\nments of space weather events to contextualize the\nAARDDVARK network observations. Hence we can\nbroaden the satellite contribution and provide key param-\neters missing from the \u2018\u2018satellite picture,\u2019\u2019 i.e., duration of\nan event, occurrence frequency, spatial structure, energy\nspectra, energy flux, depending on which is most difficult\nto measure from space and which may be determined\nthrough trial and error analysis of AARDDVARK data.\n[6] Because of the frequencies at which man-made\nnaval transmitters broadcast, allied to their high radiated\npower (typically ranging from 50 kW to 1 MW), and their\nnearly continuous operation, they are extremely well\nsuited to long-range remote sensing of the lower iono-\nsphere, probably the least studied region of the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere. These altitudes (\u000150--90 km) are too high for\nballoons and too low for most satellites, making in situ\nmeasurements extremely rare. Rocket lofted experiments\nS04001 CLILVERD ET AL.: AARDDVARK NETWORK\n2 of 15\nS04001\nhave taken place in the D region, but can only provide\nlimited coverage because of their very nature. Radio\nsoundings made at frequencies >1 MHz (e.g., ionosondes),\nwhile successful for observing the upper ionosphere,\ngenerally fail in the D region. The low electron number\ndensities at D region altitudes produce weak reflections,\nand hence measurement difficulties, particularly at night.\n[7] Observations of the amplitude and\/or phase of VLF\ntransmissions have provided information on the variation\nof the D region, both spatially and temporally. A schematic\nof subionospheric propagation is shown in Figure 1. The\nnature of the received radio waves is largely determined\nby propagation between the Earth-ionosphere boundaries\n[e.g., Cummer, 2000]. Very long-range remote sensing is\npossible; these signals can be received thousands of kilo-\nmeters from the source as shown in the results published\nby Round et al. [1925], Bichel et al. [1957], Crombie [1964],\nand many others (we direct the reader to the excellent\nsummary by Watt [1967, chapter 3]). In contrast, incoher-\nent scatter radar techniques can make measurements in\nthe D region and above [e.g., Turunen et al., 1996], but are\nlimited to essentially overhead measurements. By using\nmultiple VLF communication transmitters some under-\nstanding has been gained of both the daytime lower iono-\nsphere [McRae and Thomson, 2000], and the nighttime lower\nionosphere [Thomson et al., 2007], particularly in terms of\nhow to model it accurately through programs such as\nLWPC. Because of the complex nature of the nighttime\nlower ionosphere, or during disturbed conditions, a much\nlarger number of transmitter -- receiver paths are\nrequired. The most efficient and cost effective method\nis to use existing transmitters and deploy a large array of\nreceivers [e.g., Bainbridge and Inan, 2003]. We expand\nupon this approach to a wider range of science questions\nusing the Antarctic Arctic Radiation-belt (Dynamic)\nDeposition VLF Reasearch Konsortia network which,\noperating in the polar regions, is providing promising\nresults on a number of active space weather science\ntopics such as: Solar Proton Events, Relativistic Electron\nPrecipitation, Descent of NOx from Thermospheric\nAltitudes, and Solar Flares. We introduce each one of\nthese science areas in turn below, before describing the\nAARDDVARK network in detail, and the recent contribu-\ntions which have flowed from its observations.\nAARDDVARK data variations can be produced bymultiple\nspace weather drivers. However, with the context provided\nby other ground-based and satellite data sets, as well as\nsignatures in the AARDDVARK observations themselves,\nwe can determine the dominant space weather driver, and\nhence focus on the physics of the particular situation. This is\ndescribed below.\n1.1. Solar Proton Events\n[8] Processes on the Sun can accelerate protons to\nrelativistic energies, producing Solar Proton Events\n(SPE), also known as Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events.\nArguments continue as to whether the acceleration is\ndriven by the X-ray flare release process or in solar wind\nshock fronts during coronal mass ejections [Krucker and\nLin, 2000; Cane et al., 2003]. The high-energy component of\nthis proton population is at relativistic levels such that\nthey can reach the Earth within minutes of solar X-rays\nproduced during any solar flares which may be associated\nwith the acceleration. Satellite data show that the protons\ninvolved have an energy range spanning 1 to 500 MeV,\noccur relatively infrequently, and show high variability in\ntheir intensity and duration [Shea and Smart, 1990]. For\nlarge events the duration is typically several days, with\nrisetimes of \u00011 h, and a slow decay to normal flux values\nthereafter [Reeves et al., 1992]. SPE particles cannot access\nthe entire global atmosphere as they are partially guided\nby the geomagnetic field, such that their primary impact is\nupon the polar atmosphere. The SPE effect on VLF prop-\nagation in the polar regions is large and often observed as\na massive attenuation of the wave amplitudes lasting\nseveral days. The events can be recognized in part because\nof their close time correlation with satellite proton flux\ndata (i.e., GOES spacecraft), and in part because of a very\nsmooth lower ionosphere boundary reducing short time-\nscale variability in the AARDDVARK amplitude and\nphase data. SPEs can cause significant changes in the\nchemical balance of the atmosphere and work is currently\nunderway to quantify these effects, as described below.\n1.2. Relativistic Electron Precipitation\n[9] At geostationary orbits geomagnetic storms have\nbeen found to cause significant variations in trapped\nradiation belt relativistic electron fluxes, through a com-\nplex interplay between competing acceleration and loss\nmechanisms. Reeves [1998] found that geomagnetic storms\nproduce all possible responses in the outer belt flux levels,\ni.e., flux increases (53%), flux decreases (19%), and no\nchange (28%). Understanding the loss of relativistic elec-\ntrons is a key part to understanding the dynamics of the\nenergetic radiation belts. Flux decrease events usually\nbegin in the premidnight sector (1500--2400 MLT), and\ntypically show decreases in >2 MeV electron flux within a\nfew hours of onset, followed by an extended period of low\nflux suggesting permanent electron loss. A significant loss\nFigure 1. Schematic of subionospheric VLF propaga-\ntion. Thevastmajority of the energy inVLF transmissions\npropagate in the waveguide formed by the Earth\nand the lower edge of the ionosphere (for nighttime\n\u000185 km).\nS04001 CLILVERD ET AL.: AARDDVARK NETWORK\n3 of 15\nS04001\nmechanism that removes trapped relativistic electrons\nfrom the radiation belts is Relativistic Electron Precipita-\ntion (REP) into the atmosphere. REP has been observed to\ntake several forms, one of which is relativistic microbursts\nwhich are bursty, short-duration (<1 s) precipitation\nevents containing electrons of energy >1 MeV [Imhof et\nal., 1989; Blake et al., 1996], as well as another form which is\nprolonged precipitation lasting minutes to hours [Millan et\nal., 2002]. The relative significances of the loss mechanisms\nare currently being investigated. The REP effect on VLF\npropagation in the polar regions is highly variable, being\neither increases or decreases in amplitude or phase or\nboth, and therefore difficult to determine if it is REP that is\noccurring from the data alone. However, these events can\nbe recognized in part because of their close time correla-\ntion with elevated geomagnetic activity indices, where\noften they occur with sudden onset signatures, and in part\nwhen there is a lack of coincident SPE effects in the\nAARDDVARK data.\n1.3. Descent of NOx From Thermospheric\nAltitudes\n[10] Winter time polar odd Nitrogen, NOX (NO + NO2),\nis produced at high altitudes in the thermosphere and the\nmesosphere. During periods of efficient vertical transport\ninside the polar vortex the NOX can descend to the\nstratosphere [Solomon et al., 1982a; Siskind, 2000]. In the\nupper mesosphere the NOX is mainly in the form of NO;\nas the NOX descends it is converted to NO2 [Solomon et al.,\n1982a]. NOX plays a key role in the Ozone balance of the\nmiddle atmosphere because it destroys odd oxygen (O +\nO3) through catalytic reactions [e.g., Brasseur and Solomon,\n2005, pp. 291--299]. Hard energetic particle precipitation\n(EPP) into the mesosphere (that including a significant\npopulation of >100 keV electrons and >1 MeV protons),\nand softer EPP into the thermosphere (<100 keV elec-\ntrons), generate in situ enhancements in odd nitrogen.\nThe mesospheric source is dominated by strong impulsive\nionization episodes such as solar proton events [Verronen et\nal., 2005],while the thermospheric source ismore continuous,\nbeing dominated by auroral ionization [Siskind, 2000].\nChemical changes driven by the ionization of the neutral\natmosphere influence the ozone profile both in the meso-\nsphere and the stratosphere and therefore stratospheric\ntemperatures and dynamics. Thus the observation of sig-\nnificant levels of NOx in the polar atmosphere is a topic of\nsignificant debate in terms of atmospheric forcing.\n[11] Subionospheric VLF radio wave propagation is sen-\nsitive to ionization located below about 90 km, including\nthat produced by the ionization of descending NOX by\nLyman-a [Solomon et al., 1982b]. From the changes in\nionospheric propagation conditions during the winter\nperiod elements of the AARDDVARK network can be\nused to determine the levels of mesospheric NOX either\nthrough in situ production or descent from the thermo-\nsphere. The effect of NOX ionization enhancements on\nVLF propagation in the polar regions is variable depend-\ning on the specific propagation path being studied. On\nmany paths the influence of changing NOX is small and\nvirtually undetectable. However, on a few paths there are\nsubtle multiday changes in the quiet day curve that\ncoincide with changes in chemical composition measure-\nments made by satellites such as ENVISAT and SABRE. In\naddition, the NOX descent effect lasts for \u000110 days, and\nhence is easily differentiated from other much more short-\nlived drivers (e.g., particle precipitation). The combination\nof satellite and AARDDVARK data has improved under-\nstanding of event timing, and altitude resolution.\n1.4. Solar X-Ray Flares\n[12] During solar flares the X-ray flux received at the\nEarth increases dramatically, often within a few minutes,\nand then decays again in times ranging from a few tens of\nminutes to several hours. These X-rays have major effects\nin the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere but are absorbed before\nthey reach the ground. X-ray detectors on the GOES\nsatellites have been recording the fluxes from solar flares\nsince about 1976. During the very largest flares, such as\nthe great flare of 4 November 2003, the GOES detectors\nsaturate, resulting in considerable uncertainty as to the\nvalue of the peak X-ray flux. However, flare-induced\nionospheric changes show no saturation effects thus\nallowing the ionosphere to be used a huge detector.\nMeasurements of VLF phase changes monitored by ele-\nments of the AARDDVARK network have been used to\nextrapolate the GOES X-ray fluxes (0.1--0.8 nm) beyond\nsaturation, e.g., to calculate the peak of the great X45 flare\nusing daytime VLF paths across the Pacific to Dunedin,\nNewZealand [Thomson et al., 2004]. The X-ray flare effect on\nVLF propagation in the polar regions can be recognized\nbecause of their close time correlation with elevated X-ray\nfluxes reported from satellites (e.g., GOES). The phase\nchanges caused by the extra ionization generated by the\nflares are particularly well correlated with the flare flux\nlevels, and thus phase changes are used in AARDDVARK-\nbased studies in preference to amplitude changes.\n[13] In this paper we describe the AARDDVARK net-\nwork in detail, highlight the science undertaken so far,\nand the progress made in the areas of space weather\nresearch. We also describe the potential for integration\nwith other experimental data sets, and the coupling to\natmospheric modeling efforts.\n2. Experimental Setup\n[14] The AARDVARK network currently uses narrow\nband subionospheric VLF\/LF data spanning 10--40 kHz\nreceived at ten sites: Table 1 lists the receiver site geographic\ncoordinates, and geomagnetic L shell. These sites are part of\ntheAntarctic-ArcticRadiation-beltDynamicDepositionVLF\nAtmospheric Research Konsortia (see the description of the\ninstruments, propagation paths, data policy, publications,\npresentations, and much more at www.physics.otago.ac.nz\/\nspace\/AARDDVARK_homepage.htm). Each receiver is\ncapable of receiving multiple narrowband transmissions\nS04001 CLILVERD ET AL.: AARDDVARK NETWORK\n4 of 15\nS04001\nfrom powerful man-made communication transmitters.\nTable 2 lists some of the transmitters that are regularly\nmonitored by the AARDDVARK network. The overall\npattern of transmitters and receivers is shown in\nFigure 2. Most of our AARDDVARK sensors are deployed\nto monitor the Antarctic and Arctic regions, although\nthe plot shows that many paths could be used for\nmore equatorial studies if required. The great circle paths\nbetween the monitored VLF communications transmitters\n(Tx, circles) and the existing AARDDVARK receiver loca-\ntions (Rx, red diamonds) are shown, indicating the atmo-\nspheric areas monitored. The AARDDVARK sensors we\nplan to add to the array in the near future are shown\nas yellow squares. The effects of changing ionization\nconditions in the mesosphere, often due to energetic\nparticle precipitation, can be observed along the propaga-\ntion path between a transmitter and a receiver. The effect\nof increased ionization on the propagating signals can be\nseen as either an increase or decrease in signal amplitude\nor phase depending on the modal mixture of each signal\nobserved [Barr et al., 2000]. In detailed modeling of any\nspace weather effects it is important to be able to accu-\nrately reproduce any phase change as well as amplitude\nchange observed, in order to provide a correct interpreta-\ntion of the phenomenon. In this paper we preferentially\nshow amplitude observations and modeling results,\nalthough in the appropriate papers referenced in the text\nwe also reproduce the phase changes where possible.\nAmplitude variations are shown preferentially primarily\nbecause when undertaking analysis of multiday periods it\nis not always possible to be sure if some of the observed\nphase changes are due to geophysical, instrumental, or\ntransmitter effects.\n[15] The AARDDVARK network was formed in January\n2005. However, some of the sensors which make up the\nnetwork were individually operational well before this\ndate, while others have come online since. The instru-\nmentation involved is relatively cheap, simple, and easy to\nmaintain. The majority of the receiving systems measure\nboth the phase and amplitude of MSK modulated\nnarrowband VLF radio signals, with the demodulation\nincreasingly implemented in software running on standard\nPC hardware. Operational AARDDVARK sensors vary from\nlocation to location. The majority are currently based upon\nthe \u2018\u2018OmniPAL\u2019\u2019 narrowband VLF receiver [Dowden et al.,\n1998]. Currently, AARDDVARK sensors include the follow-\ning receiver types: OmniPAL (and its absolute phase up-\ngrade \u2018\u2018AbsPAL\u2019\u2019), UltraMSK and VELOX AARDDVARK.\nThe receivers are capable of recording the amplitude and\nphase of Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) modulated VLF\nradio transmissions. Each of these systems requires a front\nend aerial and preamplifier. The aerial is typically a vertical\nmagnetic loop antenna, preferably two orientated orthogo-\nnally as the loops are directional. Individual transmitter\nsignals are monitored on either loop depending on the\ndirection of the transmitter from the receiver site. The\nsimilarities and differences of the three primary types of\ninstrument are described briefly below.\n[16] The OmniPAL narrowband VLF receiver is a soft-\nware defined radio (SDR) system [Adams and Dowden,\nTable 1.

The hardware for the receiver consists of a custom\nbuilt Analog Device\u2019s ADSP-21xx Digital Signal Processor\n(DSP) board that resides inside a standard desktop com-\nputer. Designed in the early 1990s, DSP hardware was\nrequired for the operation of the receiver since the avail-\nable desktop computers internal hardware of that time\nwas not fast enough by itself. The DSP board has inputs\nfor up to two broadband analog VLF signals. The input\nsignal is immediately digitized at a 100 kHz sampling rate.\nThe sampling rate is driven from an externally supplied\nprecision frequency reference. From then on the rest of\nthe receiver is implemented in software that runs on the\nDSP and desktop computer. The OmniPAL receiver is\nable to simultaneously receive up to 6 VLF transmissions.\nThe broadband VLF signal is mixed with in-phase and\nquadrature phase components of a local oscillator running\nat the same frequency as the transmitter. The resulting\nin-phase and quadrature phase baseband waveforms are\nthen low-pass filtered. Next the MSK bit clock is recovered\nand the signal is integrated over one bit period. The\nreceiver incorporates a postdemodulation clipping algo-\nrithm to reduce the effect of large amplitude lightning\ngenerated impulses [Rodger et al., 2007a]. The final ampli-\ntude and phase values are averaged over a specified\ninterval of between 50 ms to 60 s and the resulting values\nare recorded to file on the desktop computer.\n[17] The UltraMSK narrowband VLF receiver is also a\nsoftware defined radio system designed to record the\namplitude and phase of MSK modulated VLF radio trans-\nmissions. The receiver implements the same direct con-\nversion radio architecture as the OmniPAL system but\nwithout the need for any custom built DSP hardware.\nCurrent desktop computing processors are now fast\nenough to run the UltraMSK receiver software without\nany additional processor support. The VLF broadband\nsignal is sampled using readily available multichannel\ncomputer audio cards. These cards are capable of digitiz-\ning the VLF signal at sampling rates of up to 96 kHz or\neven 192 kHz. The receiver uses a precise 1 Pulse Per\nSecond (PPS) signal from a GPS receiver to synthesize, in\nsoftware, any required reference frequencies, removing\nthe need for an external precision frequency reference.\nThe number of simultaneous VLF transmissions that\nthe receiver can record is only limited by the available\ncomputing resources. Typically, 10 or more transmitters\nare able to be logged with current desktop computer\nprocessors. Further information about the receiver is\navailable on the Internet at www.ultramsk.com.\n[18] The VELOX AARDVARK is a PC-based system at\nCasey Station, Antarctica, using LabVIEW graphical\nprogramming for data acquisition. This allows effective\nremote control and data visualization. The system is\nFigure 2. The great circle paths between the monitored VLF communications transmitters (Tx,\ngreen circles) and the existing AARDDVARK receiver locations (Rx, red diamonds) are shown,\nindicating the atmospheric areas monitored. Our planned AARDDVARK sensors for the future are\nshown as yellow squares.\nS04001 CLILVERD ET AL.: AARDDVARK NETWORK\n6 of 15\nS04001\nFigure 3.

Only the amplitude of the narrowband VLF radio\nwave data is collected with 1-s resolution in 100 Hz\nbandwidth channels.\n[19] Each participating institute collects and holds its\nown AARDDVARK data in the form of digital data sets\nand logs, etc. AARDDVARK members, and outside users,\ncan request selected data periods for scientific study from\none another. The exchange of AARDDVARK data from\nmembers of the Konsortia is undertaken with the goal of\nspecific scientific projects. Data exchange is undertaken\nwith the clear understanding that there will be coauthor-\nship and consultation as to any publications making use of\neach member\u2019s data. As the AARDDVARK network is\ndesigned to monitor high-latitude events driven by\nprocesses that are often constrained by geomagnetic\nlatitude, it is instructive to view the network in these\nterms. In Figure 3 we show polar projections of the great\ncircle paths between transmitters and receivers, along\nwith L shell contours that give some indication of the\nlocation of the auroral regions, and the footprint of the\nouter radiation belt.\n3. Contributions to Solar Proton Event Studies\n[20] The impacts of SPEs include \u2018\u2018upsets\u2019\u2019 experienced\nby Earth-orbiting satellites, and increased radiation expo-\nsure levels for humans onboard spacecraft and high-\naltitude aircraft. AARDVVARK studies have concentrated\non atmospheric ozone depletions and disruption to HF\/\nVHF communications in mid and high-latitude regions.\nThe most energetic SPE population deposits energy at\naltitudes as low as 20--30 km, producing ionization and\nchanging the local atmospheric chemistry. SPE particles\ngenerally are at energies below which nuclear interaction\nlosses will be significant, such that ionization-producing\natmospheric interactions are the dominant energy loss.\nSPE-produced ionization changes tend to peak at \u000173 km\naltitude [Clilverd et al., 2005], leading to local perturbations\nin ozone levels [Verronen et al., 2005]. Figure 4 (top) shows\ncalculated atmospheric ionization rates at 73 km deter-\nmined from the GOES-11 >10 MeV proton fluxes for the\nperiod 26 October to 7 November 2003 using output from\nthe Sodankyla\u00a8 Ion and Neutral Chemistry model (SIC)\n[Verronen et al., 2005]. Subionospheric radio wave ampli-\ntude changes received by elements of the AARDDVARK\nnetwork during the October\/November 2003 storms are\nalso shown in Figure 4. These studies have shown that our\nunderstanding of VLF propagation influenced by SPEs is\nhigh, such that AARDDVARK observations might be used\nto predict changes in the ionospheric D region electron\ndensity profiles during other particle precipitation events\n[e.g., Clilverd et al., 2006a]. The AARDVARK observations\nhave been used to confirm the basic chemistry schema in\nthe SIC model [Clilverd et al., 2005; 2006b] and define more\nexactly the background ionization used during nondis-\nturbed periods [Clilverd et al., 2006b].\n[21] Together with the SIC model, the AARDDVARK\nnetwork observations have been used to investigate the\ndestruction of odd oxygen through catalytic reactions with\nenhanced odd nitrogen (NOx) and odd hydrogen (HOx)\ngenerated by energetic particle precipitation [e.g., Brasseur\nand Solomon, 2005, pp. 291--299]. Figure 4 (bottom) shows\nodd oxygen changes, in particular the loss of ozone\ncalculated by the Sodankyla\u00a8 Ion and Neutral Chemistry\nmodel during the October--November 2003 SPE period.\nWhile the ozone destruction at such high altitudes is\ngenerally not important to the total ozone population,\nunder some conditions NOx can be long lived, particularly\nduring polar winter at high latitudes. In this situation\nvertical transport can drive the NOx down toward the\nlarge ozone populations in the stratosphere, leading to\nlarge long-lived ozone depletions [e.g., Reid et al., 1991].\nChanges in NOx and O3 consistent with SPE-driven mod-\nifications have been observed [Seppa\u00a8la\u00a8 et al., 2004; Verronen\net al., 2005], and large depletions in ozone during the\nArctic winter have been associated with a series of large\nSPEs over the preceding months [Randall et al., 2005].\n4. Contributions to Relativistic Electron\nPrecipitation Studies\n[22] Recently, subionospheric propagation probing using\ntheAARDDVARKnetwork observedbothREPmicrobursts\nand slower REP processes, with timescales of tens of\nminutes, during the January 2005 \u2018\u2018MINIS\u2019\u2019 balloon cam-\npaign [Clilverd et al., 2006c]. Modeling has shown that\nthese events are consistent with the precipitation of\nhighly relativistic particles (>1 MeV electrons) [Rodger\net al., 2007a]. To the best of the authors knowledge,\nAARDDVARK reported the first ground based observation\nof microburst REP, to date unreported even by multiple\nballoon campaigns (e.g., MINIS) that were focused upon\nthis goal. Estimates of flux losses due to relativistic micro-\nbursts show that they could empty the radiation belt in\nabout a day [Lorentzen et al., 2001a; O\u2019Brien et al., 2004].\nFigure 5 shows an example of the AARDDVARK subiono-\nspheric VLF observations reported by Clilverd et al. [2006a,\n2006b, 2006c]. The amplitude of multiple transmitters,\nreceived at Sodanklya\u00a8, Finland, is shown for the timeperiod\n1700--1800 UT during which the slower REP processes\nwhich occur on tens of minute scales was reported by\nX-ray detectors onboard the MINIS balloons. Both SLOW\n(timescales of tens of minutes) and FAST (short-lived\nspikes) are present in the subionospheric data. The FAST\nchanges are signatures of REP microbursts. Rodger et al.\n[2007b] showed that although FAST events were observed\non several paths of the Sodankyla\u00a8 AARDDVARK receiver\nvery few occurred simultaneously thus indicating that the\nphysical size of a microburst precipitation region is small\nand each can be thought of as a raindrop occurring as part\nof a larger cloud burst.\n[23] REP microbursts are correlated with satellite\nobserved VLF chorus wave activity [Lorentzen et al.,\n2001b]. The short duration of microbursts, similar to the\nS04001 CLILVERD ET AL.: AARDDVARK NETWORK\n8 of 15\nS04001\nindividual elements in VLF chorus, as well as the similarity\nin LT distributions have lead to the widely held assump-\ntion that REP microbursts are produced by wave-particle\ninteractions with chorus waves. However, this has yet to be\nconfirmed, and a one-to-one correlation of REP micro-\nbursts and chorus elements has yet to be demonstrated.\nBecause of the integral flux detectors present onboard\nSAMPEX, limited information on the energy spectra of\nREP microbursts has been available to date. Ground based\nAARDDVARK observations of REP microbursts confirm\nthe highly energetic spectra, where the peak electron\nprecipitation fluxes are \u00012 MeV, but this is not particularly\nconsistent with the calculated energy spectra expected for\nprecipitation from resonance with chorus waves [Rodger et\nal., 2006]. However, this may indicate the very difficult task\nof adequately modeling the interaction of VLF chorus\nFigure 4. Showing (top) the variability of solar proton fluxes >50 MeV during the October\/\nNovember 2003 Halloween storms, the effects of the solar proton precipitation (top middle) on the\nionization rate at \u000173 km, and (bottom middle) on the radio wave amplitude of the VLF transmitter\nin Seattle (NLK) received in Ny A\u02dalesund, Svalbard, Norway.

Nonetheless, the satellite and VLF\nsubionospheric measurements confirm the extremely\nhigh-energy nature of relativistic microbursts.\n[24] In addition to REP microbursts there is also another\nREP phenomena (termed SLOW events), in which REP\noccurs in long-lived bursts. Precipitation events lasting\nminutes to hours have been observed from the MAXIS\nballoon, where they typically occur at about L = 4--7, are\nobserved in the late afternoon\/dusk sector, and may be\nproduced by electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves [Millan\net al., 2002]. Loss rates suggest that these minute-hour\nevents may be the primary loss mechanism for outer zone\nrelativistic electrons. Clilverd et al. [2006a, 2006b, 2006c]\nrecently examined these SLOW REP using AARDDVARK\ndata, focusing on the total trapped flux lost into the\natmosphere. Their study focused on the sudden electron\nflux decrease of 1700 UT on 21 January 2005. The event\nshows similar local time dependence and flux level\nchanges as those reported by Onsager et al. [2002] and\nGreen et al. [2004]. The AARDDVARK-based study con-\ncluded that \u00011\/2 of the sudden electron flux decrease\nprecipitates into the atmosphere over 2.7 h, between L =\n4 and 6 [Clilverd et al., 2006a, 2006b, 2006c]. Both FAST and\nSLOW processes result in loss of outer radiation belt\nparticles, often during the same geomagnetic storm.\n5. Contributions to the Studies of Descending\nNOx\n[25] Subionospheric VLF radio wave propagation is\nsensitive to ionization located below about 90 km,\nincluding that produced by the ionization of NOX by\nLyman-a [Solomon et al., 1982b]. The effect of increased\nionization on the propagating signals can be seen as either\nan increase or decrease in signal amplitude or phase\ndepending on the modal mixture of each signal observed.\nFrom the changes in ionospheric propagation conditions\nduring the winter period we can determine the levels of\nmesospheric NOX either through in situ production or\ndescent from the thermosphere. The descent of NOX into\nthe altitude region in which AARDDVARK measurements\nare sensitive is controlled by vertical transport within\nthe high-latitude polar vortex. Descending NOX causes\ndestruction of mesospheric and stratospheric ozone, and\ntherefore influences the radiation budget of the atmo-\nsphere, driving changes in stratospheric circulation and\ntemperature.\n[26] In several recent studies we have analyzed\nAARDDVARK data from midhigh latitudes during the\nnorthern polar winters of 2003--2004, 2004--2005, and\n2005--2006 [Clilverd et al., 2005, 2006a, 2007]. Significant\nvariability is observed in the overall levels of either the\ndaytime or nighttime propagation conditions, particularly\nresulting in changes in received amplitude. The 3 years\nstudied showed significant differences in solar activity,\nand stratospheric vortex strength, allowing us to\nstudy the interplay between these two parameters. The\nAARDDVARK data sets are available to the researchers\ninvolved in real time, are easy to analyze for this effect, thus\nmaking them an important tool in the investigation of solar\nactivity influences on the middle atmosphere. Figure 6\nincludes the latest data from Ny A\u02dalesund (i.e., up to the\ndate of 20 April 2008), showing the changing winter time\nday-night propagation conditions caused by direct particle\nprecipitation below the ionosphere (shown by solid vertical\nlines), or by enhanced NOX (dotted vertical lines). Note the\nlack of recent events due to the proximity of 11-year solar\ncycle minimum.\n[27] Over recent years there has been significant dis-\ncussion about the altitude at which descending NOX is\ngenerated, as this could identify the source mechanism.\nMany papers have discussed the events of the northern\nhemisphere winter 2003--2004. Although several powerful\nsolar storms occurred at the beginning of the 2003--2004\nwinter period (October and November) the main cause of\nthe descending NOX observed at the end of the winter\nperiod was uncertain because of the breakup of the\nstratospheric vortex in late December 2003. Renard et al.\n[2006] suggested that the source of descending NOX was in\nsitu production at around 60 km caused by electrons of a\nfew hundred keV, due to a geomagnetic storm that\noccurred on 22--25 January 2004. However, Clilverd et al.\n[2006a] used AARDDVARK data to show that the primary\nsource altitude for the NOX in this time period was the\nauroral zones in the thermosphere, and not a result of in\nsitu production in the mesosphere. The descent of the\nNOX began a few days after the end of the stratospheric\nwarming event at the end of December 2003. In that study\nFigure 5.

The radio wave index is shown, representing the\namplitude difference between average midday and midnight propagation conditions, with solid\nvertical lines representing times of changed ionization conditions due to solar proton events (with\nthe peak >10 MeV fluxes in brackets), and the dashed vertical lines representing ionization\nchanges caused by the descent of odd nitrogen (NOX) from the thermosphere.\nS04001 CLILVERD ET AL.: AARDDVARK NETWORK\n11 of 15\nS04001\nit was unclear whether the thermospheric reservoir of\nhigh-altitude NOX was generated by the large solar storms\nseveral months earlier, or by an accumulation of the\neffects of smaller storms as suggested by Siskind [2000].\n[28] Using a combination of AARDDVARK data and\nGOMOS satellite observations of NO2 Seppa\u00a8la\u00a8 et al.\n[2007] showed that there were several contributions to\nthe NOX\/ozone variations during the winter 2003--2004.\nOne significant source of NOX was the thermosphere,\ngenerated by nonrelativistic electron precipitation, while\nsolar proton precipitation from solar storms, and relativistic\nelectron precipitation driven by geomagnetic storms were\nalso significant at various times across this period. These\nmechanisms produce NOX at different altitudes, and over\ndifferent timescales so the combined effect on the ozone\npopulation is incomplete and still needs clarification. All\nof these mechanisms produce well defined effects in\nAARDDVARK data, and those observations can be used\nto determine the precipitation energy spectra and describe\nthe underlying physical processes that cause the precipi-\ntation [Turunen et al., 2009].\n6. Contributions to Solar Flare Studies\n[29] For daytime solar flares, both the D region height\nlowering and the subsequent phase advance of VLF sig-\nnals (at least for path lengths greater than a few Mm) have\nbeen found to be nearly proportional to the logarithm of\nthe X-ray flux [McRae and Thomson, 2004]. Many of the\npropagation paths monitored by the AARDDVARK net-\nwork are sensitive to solar flare effects because they often\nmonitor long transequatorial paths. An extensive data set\nof flare events has already been recorded. In addition, the\nnetwork paths are sensitive to the massive effects of\nmagnetars [Inan et al., 1999], with several already captured\nin archive data.\n[30] Unlike GOES X-ray flux measurements made from\ngeosynchronous orbit, D region flare-induced ionospheric\nchanges show no saturation effects, even for very large\nflares [Thomson et al., 2004], and therefore allow the study\nof extreme solar events. The received VLF phase changes\ncan be used to measure the X-ray fluxes, even though\nGOES X-ray fluxes have may have reached saturation, and\ndetermine the peak levels. Thomson et al. [2004, 2005] used\nthis technique on the 4 November 2003 flare event, com-\nbining GOES fluxes in the band 0.1--0.8 nm together with\nthe AARDDVARK data from daytime VLF paths across\nthe Pacific to Dunedin, New Zealand, including the trans-\nmitters NLK (Seattle, 24.8 kHz), NPM (Hawaii, 21.4 kHz),\nand NDK (North Dakota, 25.2 kHz). They found that the\ntechnique gave a magnitude of X45 \u00b1 5 (4.5 \u00b1 0.5 mW\/m2 in\nthe 0.1--0.8 nm band) for the great flare as compared with\nthe value of X28 (2.8 mW\/m2 in the 0.1--0.8 nm band)\nestimated by NOAA\u2019s Space Environment Center (SEC)\n(http:\/\/sec.noaa.gov\/weekly\/pdf2003\/prf1471.pdf) derived\nfrom GOES measurements which saturated at \u0001X20. The\ngreat X45 flare is the largest yet measured. This work\nshowed that solar flares can be more extreme than previ-\nously thought. Figure 7 shows an example of a comparison\nbetween a series of both strong and weak solar flares seen\nin GOES X-ray flux data and the VLF subionospheric\nmeasurements from the transmitters NWC (North West\nCape, Australia), NTS (Sale, Australia) and JAP (Japan)\nobserved at Casey, Antarctica. The AARDDVARK net-\nwork is able to monitor solar flare activity because of its\ncomprehensive longitude coverage, always ensuring that\nsome paths are on the day side of the Earth.\n7. Future Expansion Plans\n[31] As indicated in Figure 2 the AARDDVARK network\nis likely to expand in the near future to include several\nmore receiving stations, and thus increase the local time\ncoverage of subionospheric propagation conditions in\nboth the northern and southern hemispheres. With the\npotential for upcoming satellite missions to investigate\nacceleration and loss processes in the Van Allen belts\n(RBSP, ORBITALS, ERG) the AARDDVARK network is\nperfectly positioned to provide high time resolution, con-\ntinuous particle precipitation data that will enhance the\nunderstanding of the physical loss processes taking place.\n[32] AARDDVARK data will also support the NASA\nfunded BARREL (Balloon Array for Radiation-belt\nRelativistic Electron Losses) experiment that will be under-\ntaken in 2012 with a view to investigate relativistic electron\nprecipitation processes. The combination of AARDDVARK\ndata and the MINIS balloon X-ray flux data, during an\nintense geomagnetic storm associated with a coronal mass\nejection from the Sun has already shown the value of the\nnetwork [Clilverd et al., 2007]. The AARDDVARK network\nalso overlaps regions where there are substantial arrays of\nriometers well positioned to provide point measurements\nof overhead ionization conditions, e.g., GLORIA and\nNORSTAR [Spanswick et al., 2005]. The combination of\nthese two experimental techniques allows improved reso-\nlution of the energy spectra of precipitating fluxes.\n[33] Future expansions of the AARDDVARK network\nwill highlight quasi-constant L shell propagation paths to\nprovide clearer description of the precipitation processes\noccurring within well-defined regions of the magneto-\nsphere. The strength of the quasi-constant L shell propa-\ngation path analysis was shown by the observations of\nlong-term precipitation caused by plasmaspheric hiss\nafter an outer radiation belt injection into L = 3 [Rodger et\nal., 2007b]. Future expansion will also allow global cover-\nage of space weather events, rather than the limited\ncoverage currently available. Expanding into the southern\nhemisphere is a particular problem for the experimental\nobservations, but combined solar- and wind-powered\nsystems are being considered for the near future.\n8. Summary\n[34] The Antarctic-Arctic Radiation-belt (Dynamic)\nDeposition-VLF Atmospheric Research Konsortium is\na global network of radio receivers designed to make\nS04001 CLILVERD ET AL.: AARDDVARK NETWORK\n12 of 15\nS04001\ncontinuous long-range observations of the lower iono-\nsphere at mid to high-latitude regions. The network of\ncheap, easy to install, easy to maintain sensors are used to\ndetect changes in ionization levels from \u000130--90 km\naltitude, ultimately sensing pace weather events globally,\ncontinuously, and with high time resolution. All with the\ngoal of increasing the understanding of energy coupling\nbetween the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the Sun, and space.\n[35] The AARDDVARK network has contributed to the\nscientific understanding of an increasing list of space\nweather science topics, including the chemical modifica-\ntion of the middle atmosphere during solar proton events,\nthe precipitation mechanisms of relativistic electrons, the\ndescent of NOx into the middle atmosphere, and the\neffects of large solar flares. These science areas impact\nour knowledge of space weather processes, global atmo-\nspheric change, communications, and navigation. Future\nexpansions of the network will increase the science\npotential and provide global coverage of space weather\nevent signatures.\n[36] Acknowledgments.
