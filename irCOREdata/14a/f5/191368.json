It is believed to have huge potential benefits in areas as diverse \nas drug development, information and communication technologies, and the production of \nstronger, lighter materials 2;3.  \nDespite extensive potential applications in material sciences and engineering, \nexposure of man to nanoparticles and nanomaterials throughout manufacturing, application \nand waste management necessitates investigations for potential biological hazards of such \nmaterials on health and environment1.   \nCarbon nanotubes are cylindrical carbon molecules that exhibit unusual strength, \ndisplay unique electrical properties and are efficient conductors of heat. They can be \npacked with DNA molecules or peptides after which they may deliver their contents to \nspecific target sites, in various tissues, for therapeutic purposes 4;5. While commercial \ninterest in this material is leading to the development of mass production and handling \nfacilities 3, little is known about the toxicity of this material. \nHowever, it has been recently reported that carbon nanotubes exhibit cytotoxicity to \nhuman keratinocyte cells 6. They can inhibit the growth of embryonic rat-brain neuron \ncells7, HEK293 cells and human embryo kidney cells, by inducing cell apoptosis and \ndecreasing cellular adhesion ability 8. In addition, Lam and colleagues showed that \nintratracheal (i.t.) instillation of single-wall carbon nanotubes in mice induced persistent \nepithelioid granulomas and interstitial inflammation 9. Warheit et al., 10 in rats, reported \nthat  i.t. instillation of single-wall carbon nanotubes caused transient inflammation and cell \ninjury and resulted in the formation of multifocal granulomas centered around nanotubes, \n  \n3 \n \nsimilar to a foreign body reaction. Nevertheless, the relevance of these observations has \nbeen questioned because the formation of granulomas was suspected to be the consequence \nof the instillation as a bolus of agglomerated nanotubes 10. More recently, it has been \nshown that i.t. administration of both multi-wall carbon nanotubes (CNT) or ground CNT \nto rats, stimulated lung cells to produce TNF-\u03b1, causing lung inflammation and fibrosis 11. \nHowever, the consequences of pulmonary inflammation exposure to CNT for \ncardiovascular endpoints or systemic inflammation induction are unknown.  \nWe have recently shown that nanoparticles diffuse rapidly, i.e. within 1 hour, from \nthe lungs into the systemic circulation in hamsters 12 and in humans 13. We have also \ndemonstrated, in hamsters, that intravenously and intratracheally administered positively \ncharged polystyrene nanoparticles enhance experimental thrombosis in hamsters 14;15. In \nsubsequent studies, we have shown that diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) cause lung \ninflammation accompanied by the development of a peripheral vascular thrombogenic \ntendency, caused by platelet sensitization. We have also demonstrated that histamine \nrelease by pulmonary mast cells plays a major role in triggering these processes 16-18. \n In the present study, we have investigated the effect of acute exposure (24 h) to \nCNT on lung inflammation and its consequences for peripheral thrombogenicity \nmodification, in mice. Moreover, we have investigated in more detail the extent of \nsystemic platelet activation and have addressed the importance of platelet surface \nexpressed P-selectin in upregulating the peripheral arterial thrombogenicity.      \n  \n4 \n \n \nMaterial and Methods \nNanotubes  \nGround multi-wall carbon nanotubes (CNT) were a gift from Prof. D. Lison \n(Industrial Toxicology and Occupational Medicine Unit, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de \nLouvain). They were manufactured by the laboratory of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance at \nthe Facult\u00e9s universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix in Namur. Multi-wall carbon nanotubes \n(15 carbon layers on average) were synthesized by the decomposition of ethylene on an \nalumina support doped with a cobalt\u2013iron catalyst mixture and purified by subsequent \ntreatment with NaOH 19. They were ground in an oscillatory agate ball mill (Pulverisette 0, \nFritsch), with a vertical vibration of 1 mm applied for 6 h. The length of individual \nnanotubes was significantly reduced by grinding (0.7 \u00b1 0.07 \u00b5m vs 5.9 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b5m), but \nother characteristics of the material such as average inner diameter (5.1 \u00b1 2.1 nm vs 5.2 \u00b1 \n1.5 nm), average outer diameter (11.3 \u00b1 3.9 nm vs 9.7 \u00b1 2.1 nm), specific surface area (307 \n\u00b1 15 m2\/g vs 378 \u00b1 20 m2\/g), oxidized forms (13.1 \u00b1 0.7 atomic % vs 13.7 \u00b1 0.7 atomic %) \nand carbon content (98.0 \u00b1 0.2 % vs 97.8 \u00b1 0.2) were not affected by the grinding process \n11.  \nCNT were suspended in sterile pyrogen-free saline (NaCl 0.9 %) containing tween \n80 (0.1%). To minimize their aggregation, CNT suspensions were always sonicated \n(Branson 1200, VEL, Leuven, Belgium) for 15 min and vortexed immediately (< 1 min) \nbefore their dilution and prior to intratracheal administration.  \nSamples of the CNT suspension were also applied, immediately, to \nformvar\/carbon-coated nickel grids (300mesh). The liquid was then removed and the grids \nwere air-dried before examination in a Zeiss 902A electron microscope.  Ground CNT \nDeleted: (To be completed by \nDavid)\nDeleted: \nDeleted: during \nDeleted: \nDeleted: \nDeleted: Control mice received \nsaline containing tween 80 \n(0.1%).\n  \n5 \n \nwere also suspended in absolute ethanol, sonicated for 30 min and examined as described \nabove.  \n  \n6 \n \n \nAnimals and intratracheal instillation of CNT \nThis project was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the \nUniversity of Leuven and experiments were performed in accordance with protocols \napproved by the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee. \nMale and female Swiss mice weighing 45-50 g, were used. They were anesthetized \nwith sodium pentobarbital (60 mg\/kg, i.p.), placed supine with extended neck on an angled \nboard. A Becton Dickinson 24 Gauge cannula was inserted via the mouth into the trachea. \nThe CNT suspensions (200 or 400 \u00b5g\/mouse) or vehicle-only were instilled (40 \u00b5l) via a \nsterile syringe and followed by an air bolus of 50 \u00b5l. \n \nBronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis \nTwenty-four hours following the i.t. instillation of CNT or vehicle, mice were \nkilled with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital. The trachea was cannulated and lungs \nwere lavaged three times with 0.7 ml (a total volume of 2.1 ml) of sterile NaCl 0.9%. The \nrecovered fluid aliquots were pooled. No difference in the volume of collected fluid was \nobserved between the different groups. BAL fluid was centrifuged (1,000 g x 10 min, \n4\u00b0C). Cells were counted in a Thoma hemocytometer after resuspension of the pellets and \nstaining with 1% gentian violet. The cell differentials were microscopically performed on \ncytocentrifuge preparations fixed in methanol and stained with Diff Quick (Dade, Brussels, \nBelgium). The supernatant was stored at - 80 \u00b0C until further analysis.  \n \nExperimental arterial thrombosis model \nTwenty-four hours after i.t. instillation of CNT or saline, in vivo thrombogenesis \nwas assessed. Following induction of anesthesia, mice were placed in a supine position on \n  \n7 \n \na heating pad at 37\u00b0C, tracheotomized, and artificially ventilated (Hugo Sachs Apparatus \nMinivent type 845 respirator; Hugo Sachs Elektronik-Harvard Apparatus GmbH, March-\nHugstetten, Germany).  A 2F venous catheter (Portex, Hythe, UK) was inserted in the right \njugular vein for the administration of Rose Bengal. Thereafter, the right carotid artery was \nexposed from the surrounding tissue and mounted on a transilluminator. After the \nintravenous administration of Rose Bengal (20 mg\/kg), the segment of the carotid artery \nwas irradiated with green light (540 nm) for 90 seconds, using an optic fiber mounted on a \nmicromanipulator located 5 mm above the artery. The thrombus was monitored under a \nmicroscope at x 40 magnification. The change over time in light transmission through the \nblood vessel at the site of the trauma was recorded using a microscope-attached camera. \nImages were recorded at intervals of 10 seconds over a period of 40 minutes. Image \nanalysis was used to quantitate thrombus intensity. The size of the thrombus was expressed \nin arbitrary units (A.U.) as the total area under the curve, when plotting light intensity \nagainst time 15;20;21. The mice were euthanized at the end of the recording. \n \nGranulocyte-platelet heteroconjugate detection \nIn separate animals, after i.t. instillation with saline or saline containing CNT (400 \n\u00b5g), blood samples were collected from the retroorbital sinus on citrate (0.4 %) containing \nhirudin (20 \u00b5g\/ml), G4120 (1\u00b5g\/ml) and prostin (1 mg\/ml). To determine the existence of \nheteroconjugates between granulocytes and platelets via flow cytometry, 1ml of cellFix \n(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was added to 200 \u00b5l of blood, followed by \nvortexing. After 1 h fixation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged for 5 min at \n2000 rpm. One ml of PBS was added to the pellet and upon vortexing, cells were \ncentrifuged for 5 min at 1200 rpm to eliminate fixative. Thereafter, one ml of lysis buffer \n(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ USA) was added to the pellet, and upon vortexing, \nDeleted: during \n  \n8 \n \ncells were centrifuged for 5 min at 1200 rpm. The lysis step was then repeated. A washing \nstep was performed by adding 1 ml of PBS to the pellet followed by centrifugation for 5 \nmin at 1200 rpm. The pellet was then resuspended in 50 \u00b5l of PBS and 50 \u00b5l of rat serum \nwere added, together with 5 \u00b5l of the leukocyte commun common? antigen Ly-5 marker, \n(=CD45?) R-phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse antibody 30-F11 (Pharmingen, San \nDiego, CA) and 5 \u00b5l of platelet \u03b1IIb\u03b2III marker FITC-labelled rat ant-mouse integrin \nCD41\/61 antibody MO20 (Emfret, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany). Following incubation in the dark \nat 4\u00b0C, for 20-40 min, 0.5 ml PBS was added and sample acquisition on a FACSCalibur \n(Becton & Dickinson, San Jos\u00e9, CA) was done immediately.  \nLive gating was performed on leukocyte-sized events to exclude single platelets; \ngranulocytes were selected on the basis of their forward and side scatter characteristics, as \nwell as CD45 positivity. Gated CD45 positive granulocytes were then analysed for the \npresence of bound platelets in histogram plots of platelet integrin intensity. \n \nIn vivo P-selectin neutralization in PMN influx in the lung and in peripheral arterial \nthrombosis \nTo assess the role of platelet P-selectin in CNT-induced lung inflammation and \nenhancement of peripheral thrombogenicity, mice were i.v. injected, through the tail vein, \nwith 60 \u00b5g of the anti\u2013P-selectin blocking monoclonal antibody (RB40.34; Becton \nDickinson, San Diego, CA), and 10 min later saline or saline containing CNT (400 \u00b5g) was \ni.t. instilled. Leukocyte-platelet conjugate detection, arterial thrombosis in vivo and PMN \ninflux in BAL were assessed as outlined above. \n \n \nDeleted:  \n  \n9 \n \nStatistics  \n Data are expressed as means \u00b1 SEM. Comparisons between groups were performed \nby one way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Newman-Keuls multiple range \ntests. P values <0.05 are considered significant. \n  \n10\n \n \nResults \nCarbon nanotube characterization  \nIndividual CNTs were evident in all samples examined by electron microscopy but \naggregates, up to 25\u00b5m in longest dimension, were found in those prepared from saline \nsuspensions.  These aggregates may have been drying artefacts as many CNTs were \ncoalesced around crystals of NaCl.  This interpretation is consistent with the absence of \nsuch aggregates in samples prepared in ethanol (figure 1); the improved dispersion of \nCNTs over the grids may well reflect the lower surface tension and greater volatility of this \nmedium.  The CNTs were contorted to various degrees, no partitions were observed across \nthe lumen but several \u2018T & Y\u2019 branches were present. Most individual CNTs were less \nthan 10\u00b5m long and approximately 10nm in diameter.  A small proportion (>5%) were \napproximately 5nm in diameter and fragments of these CNTs, some as short as 70nm, were \nthe smallest particles detected.  \n \nCNT trigger lung inflammation \nDepending on the i.t. treatment performed, the cells found in BAL were primarily \nmacrophages and PMN as specified below. Lymphocytes were not found in control mouse \nBAL. No other cells were observed microscopically (figure 2). Diff-Quik stain of the cells \nrecovered in bronchoalveolar BAL fluid revealed that CNT are mainly taken up by \nmacrophages. However, aggregates of uningested CNT were also seen (Figure 2d).  \nThe intratracheal instillation of CNT resulted in a marked cellular influx in the lung \nat doses of 200 and 400 \u00b5g\/mouse. While the number of macrophages did not increase \n(figure 2a), PMN numbers increased 8-fold at 200 \u00b5g\/mouse (p < 0.05) and 12-fold at 400 \n\u00b5g\/mouse (p < 0.05; figure 2b). \nCNT enhance experimental arterial thrombosis \nDeleted: (To be completed by \nDavid)\nDeleted: \u00b6\nDeleted:  (figure 1). \nDeleted: undigested \n  \n11\n \nFigure 3 illustrates that the intratracheal instillation of CNT induced an increase in \nthe cumulative mass of thrombus formed in vivo over a 40-minute interval in a \nphotochemically injured carotid artery. CNT induced a dose-dependent augmentation of \narterial thrombosis at a dose of 200 \u00b5g per animal (+245 %, P<0.05) and 400 \u00b5g per animal \n(+350 %, P<0.01). \n \n \n \nI.t. administration of CNT leads to platelet-leukocyte conjugates in circulating blood \nFigure 4a shows the Forward (FSc) versus Side (SSc) scatter distribution of murine \nblood cells. Figure 4b illustrates the SSc versus CD45 scatter diagram; gating is performed \nvia the cross-section of R1 (figure 4d) and R2 (figure 4b), enabling for selection of CD45 \npositive granulocytes, excluding monocytes and free platelets. Figure 4c, shows CD41\/61 \ndistribution in the selected granulocyte cross-sectional gate and illustrates the occurrence \nof heteroconjugates of platelets and granulocytes, 6h after CNT administration.  \nAfter i.t. administration of CNT (400 \u00b5g\/animal), 6 h appeared to be optimal for the \ndetection of heteroconjugates (figure 4d). No formation of conjugates was found at 3 h \n(measured in relation to baseline in non-treated controls, set as 100 %: 104 \u00b1 48 % in \nsaline control group vs 109 \u00b1 43 % in CNT group, n = 3-4), at 12 h (110 \u00b1 30 % in saline \ncontrol group vs 100 \u00b1 30 % in CNT group, n = 4) or at 24 h (106 \u00b1 23 % in saline control \ngroup vs 98 \u00b1 33 % in CNT group, n = 3).  \nFigure 4d shows that 6 h after i.t. administration of CNT, there was a significant \nincrease of systemic platelet activation, as measured by the existence of platelet-leukocyte \n  \n12\n \nconjugates in systemic blood (130 % in control group vs 245 % in CNT group, p < 0.05, n \n= 6). \nConsequences of P selectin neutralization on lung inflammation and thrombosis \nPretreatment of control mice with the neutralizing antibody anti-P selectin \nRB.40.34 did not significantly affect the number of macrophages in BAL (figure 5a), nor \nreduce the degree of CNT-induced PMN infiltration (figure 5b). Yet, heteroconjugate \nformation measured 6 h after i.t. administration of CNT was found to be blocked (figure 6) \ncompatible with a role for P-selectin in the heteroconjugate formation 22 and therefore \nconfirming that systemic platelet activation is potent enough to cause \u03b1-degranulation and \nP-selectin mediated platelet binding to circulatory leukocytes. \nP-selectin neutralization did not affect the number of platelets in saline-treated mice \n(Ab-treated: 659,200 \u00b1 55,766\/\u00b5L vs 641,250 \u00b1 74,137\/\u00b5L) or in CNT-treated mice (Ab-\ntreated 718,800 \u00b1 66,917\/\u00b5L vs 715,000 \u00b1 158,406\/\u00b5L). Whereas pre-treatment with anti-\nP-selectin antibody had no effect on the mild thrombotic response recorded in saline-\ntreated mice (figure 7), the CNT amplification of thrombogenesis was abrogated, in \nagreement with a platelet P-selectin mediated systemic activation thrombotic sensitization \nby CNT. \n  \n13\n \nDiscussion \nIn the present work we provide evidence that CNT deposited in the lung can \nupregulate lung inflammation and peripheral arterial thrombosis, the latter resulting from \nplatelet activation, as measured via P-selectin dependent platelet-leukocyte conjugate \nformation in the circulation. The arterial thrombogenicity enhancement occurs within 24 \nhours of CNT exposure.  \nPathophysiological analysis upon in vivo administration of high doses of intact \nCNT has proven difficult, because of mortality in about 15 % or 55 % of exposed rats (5 \nmg\/kg) 10 or mice (16 mg\/kg) 9, respectively.  This effect has been explained by \nmechanical blockade of the upper airways by the instillate rather than by inherent toxicity \nof CNT 10. Yet, recently, Muller et al. 11 have reported that CNT induce the formation of \nbronchial granulomas developing around focal aggregates of CNT.  \nIndustrial use of carbon nanotubes comprises applications such as inclusion in \npolymers or other matrices, for which applications, an appropriate dispersion is essential \nand ground instead of intact nanotubes are used 23-25.  Except for the length of individual \nnanotubes, significantly reduced by grinding, other characteristics such as average \ndiameter, specific surface area, oxidation state or carbon content are not affected by \ngrinding 11.  Nevertheless, it has been reported that, like intact CNT, ground CNT can also \ncause lung inflammation and fibrosis. Lesions found were uniformly distributed, dose\u2013\ndependent and persisted up to 60 days 11. \nConsequently, in the present study, we have investigated the acute (24 h) effects \nspecifically of ground CNT on pulmonary and systemic inflammation and on the risk of \narterial thrombosis in mice. Unlike those studies reporting high rate of mortality after i.t. \ninstillation of intact carbon nanotube 9;10, we did not record any mortality throughout the \nentire study.  \nDeleted: \nDeleted:  similarly to\nDeleted: also \nDeleted: were \n  \n14\n \nOur data show that CNT are taken up by macrophages and cause a dose-dependent \nincrease of neutrophil influx in BAL fluid. Similar findings have been reported in rats, 3 \ndays after i.t. of intact or ground CNT (2.5 and 10 mg\/kg) 11. An increase of neutrophils in \nBAL fluid of rats lungs was observed 24 hours after exposure to single-wall CNT (5 \nmg\/kg) in rats 10. We have recently made similar observations in hamsters, i.t. instilled \nwith DEP or silica particles 16;17;26. \nIntratracheal instillation of a bolus of particles, although non-physiological, leads to \nqualitatively similar results as via inhalation, for various biologic endpoints such as \npulmonary inflammation and fibrosis 27. The i.t. instillation technique enables the delivery \nof an accurate doseto the lungs of each animal, facilitating dose-effect study 27 \nShortcomings include the administration as a bolus as opposed to inhalation over long time \nintervals. The consequence of the latter on our findings remains to be established using \nexposure by inhalation. In hamsters, we have previously reported that i.t. administered \nparticles are able to increase the risk of thrombosis 16;17;26. These conclusions were \nessentially based on femoral vein thrombosis studies because thrombus formation could be \nmore easily studied in conditions of low blood flow. The present model of thrombosis in \nthe carotid artery of mice is more suited than the hamster model for the study of \nextrapulmonary consequences of pulmonary inflammation, because of its blood flow \npattern, which is arterial. The prothrombotic \"enhancement\" of peripheral arterial \nthrombosis resulting from limited endothelial damage constitutes therefore a realistic \nexperimental approach for human thrombosis, causal of acute myocardial infarction.  \nP-selectin is found in storage \u03b1-granules of platelets and endothelial cells. It plays a \ncritical role in the interactions between platelets, endothelial cells and leukocytes, \npromoting leukocyte rolling on activated endothelium. Endothelial P-selectin, initiates \ncapture and rolling of circulating leukocytes at sites of inflammation and atherosclerosis 28-\nDeleted: permits to establish\nDeleted: delivery \n  \n15\n \n30, but also P-selectin, expressed on platelets, has been shown to be responsible for the \ninitial rolling of leukocytes along the inflamed endothelium and to be involved in \natherogenesis 29;31-33. To a great extent, this interaction is mediated by binding of platelet P-\nselectin to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) expressed on leukocytes 33;33;34.  \nTo establish a link between pulmonary inflammation and cardiovascular endpoints \nsuch as arterial thrombosis, we first investigated the existence of platelet activation in the \ncirculation making use of the decoy function of leukocytes, upon their encounter with \nactivated platelets 35;36. Platelet-leukocyte conjugates were detected in blood after i.t. \nadministration of 400 \u00b5g CNT\/mouse. We found a significant increase of conjugates 6 h \nafter i.t. instillation of CNT but not after 12 and 24 h. However, when our mice were \npretreated with an anti\u2013P-selectin blocking monoclonal antibody 37, the CNT-mediated \nplatelet-leuckocyte conjugate formation was completely blocked, compatible with \nsufficient platelet activation in the circulation to trigger \u03b1-degranulation, P-selectin \nexpression and P-selectin mediated cell interactions 31.  \nIn the context of allergic reactions, previous studies using in vivo models of \ninflammatory reactions in the skin 38 and the peritoneal cavity 39 have demonstrated that P-\nselectin plays an important role in allergic inflammation soon (3-12 hours) rather than later \n(20-24 hours) after allergen challenge. By contrast, Pitchford et al.37 have recently reported \na role for P-selectin at both 8 hours and 24 hours after allergen challenge. However, in the \npresent study, PMN influx in BAL was not affected by P-selectin neutralization. Whereas \nPitchford et al.37 found that P-selectin expression on the surfaces of platelets is a major \nrequirement for pulmonary eosinophil and lymphocyte recruitment, allowing circulating \nplatelets to bind to and stimulate leukocytes for endothelial attachment. The cells presently \nidentified are different. In fact, we did not find lymphocytes or eosinophils in BAL of mice \nexposed to CNT and the inflammatory cell identified in our model is the neutrophil. \nDeleted: early \n  \n16\n \nP-selectin neutralization does not affect the mild thrombus formation induced by \nendothelial denudation of the carotid artery, showing that platelet-P-selectin is not directly \ninvolved in the control of thrombus stability. Nevertheless, abrogation of the amplification \nof arterial thrombogenesis at 24 h by P-selectin neutralization, shows that activated platelet \nP-selectin plays an essential role in the prothrombotic effect executed by CNT but at \nanother level. A causal relationship may exist with the measured heteroconjugates. In this \nrespect, our data are in agreement with the findings of Yokoyama et al.31 who \ndemonstrated an essential role for platelet P-selectin in arterial thrombogenesis, via the \nformation of large stable platelet-leukocyte aggregates. Priming circulating neutrophils by \nadhering activated platelets will further activate leukocytes and may upregulate and release \nenzymes such as elastase and cathepsin G which contribute to the development of a \nthrombotic tendency via priming platelets for a subsequent encounter with a mildly injured \nvessel wall eventually26 even when these enzymes proteolytically degrade PSGL-140. \nLeukocyte inflammation is associated with elevated microvesicle formation, positive for \ntissue factor.  P-selectin positive microvesicles may likewise exert an inflammatory action \nby activating leukocytes, both phenomena probably playing a central role in thrombus \nformation 41. Finally, even when degranulated platelets rapidly lose their surface P-selectin \nas a consequence of proteolysis, these platelets continue to circulate and may participate in \nthe CNT-induced enhancement of thrombosis. \nIn conclusion, our data provide novel evidence that, within 24 h of their deposition in \nthe lungs, CNT cause pulmonary inflammation responsible for systemic platelet activation \nvia P-selectin dependent platelet-leukocyte conjugation and subsequent arterial \nthrombogenecity enhancement. Our findings provide experimental evidence that newly \nengineered CNT affect not only the respiratory tract but also the cardiovascular system \njustifying a thorough health risk assessment for carbon nanotubes. \nDeleted: i\nDeleted: e\nDeleted: s\nDeleted: likely \nDeleted: after \n  \n17\n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis work was supported by the funds of the K.U.Leuven (OT\/02\/45) and by the \nFund for Scientific Research Flanders (G.0165.03).
