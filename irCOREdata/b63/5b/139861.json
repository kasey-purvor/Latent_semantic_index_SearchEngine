Active and \npassive coatings, deposited using the Langmuir Blodgett and Electro-static Self Assembly \ntechniques, have been utilised to influence the transmission spectrum of optical fibres, with the aim \nof developing sensor elements and in-line components for telecommunications systems.  Coupled \nwaveguide, fibre grating and miniature Fabry-Perot cavities are described. \n \n 3 \n1. Introduction \nThe ability to interact with and\/or control the properties of light propagating in optical fibres is of \nfundamental importance in both optical fibre sensor and optical telecommunication technologies. \nBy interacting with the propagating modes it is possible to make sensors for a range of measurands \nand also to control the properties of the guided light, producing a family of functional devices such \nas tuneable filters and modulators. \n \nThe use of active and passive nano-structured coatings deposited onto optical fibres as a means for \ncontrolling the transmission spectrum of an optical fibre is reviewed within this paper. The use of \nthin film deposition techniques offering the ability to control the film thickness on the nanometer \nscale is significant, as this facilitates the optimisation of the interaction of the guided mode with the \ncoating.  \n \n The devices created in this fashion offer an exciting prospect for the development of optical fibre \nsensors and devices. The coatings may be engineered to change their optical properties in response \nto an external stimulus. A number of configurations are discussed which facilitate interaction \nbetween modes of the optical fibre and the coatings, offering techniques for monitoring changes in \nthe coating\u2019s optical properties. The sensors offer the advantages common to all fibre optic sensors: \nimmunity to electromagnetic interference, small dimensions, light weight and the prospect for \nmultiplexed arrays. \n \n 4 \n2. Nano-structured coating deposition techniques  \n2.1 Introduction \nThe two major nano-coating techniques that will be discussed in this section are electrostatic self-\nassembly (ESA) and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) deposition. Each facilitates the deposition of a \nsurface coating one molecular layer at a time \u2013 giving nm scale thickness control. Both techniques \nallow the formation of thin films at room temperature and pressure. \n \n2.2 The Langmuir Blodgett Technique \nThe LB technique allows the manipulation of material at the molecular level1,2. The technique is \nbased on the fabrication of organic monolayer films, which are first oriented on a subphase and \nsubsequently transferred, layer by layer, onto a solid surface at room temperature and molecule \nspecific pressure. This offers high resolution control over the film thickness (1 nm -  3 nm per \nlayer), and is thus ideal for waveguide applications. \n \nMolecules constituting the LB film are usually amphiphilic, i.e. they have hydrophobic and \nhydrophilic tail or head groups1,2. Classic examples of these molecules are fatty acids such as \nstearic acid and \u03c9-tricosenoic acid. In the case of stearic acid, the carboxylic acid group acts as the \nhydrophilic portion, while the C17H35 hydrocarbon acts as a hydrophobic tail. A monolayer of the \nmaterial is formed by applying the molecules to the surface of a subphase in the form of a solution. \nThe solvent is allowed to evaporate, leaving the molecules dispersed across the whole of the water \nsurface and oriented with the hydrophobic part upwards and the hydrophilic part in the water, \nproducing a floating monolayer. Reducing the surface area by means of a moving barrier, the \nmolecules begin to repel one another, modifying the surface pressure3. The change in surface \npressure may be monitored to produce a surface pressure isotherm, such as that shown in figure 1. \nThe isotherm has three distinct phases; gas, liquid condensed and solid.  \n \n 5 \nAt the onset of compression, the molecules are randomly oriented, and experience weak interaction \nwith each other, behaviour analogous to a two dimensional gas. Upon further compression the \nmolecules are pushed closer together as the hydrophobic tails of the molecules begin to lift from the \nsurface. The molecules undergo a transition from the gas phase to a liquid-condensed phase, which \nis accompanied by a steep rise in surface pressure. Further compression reduces the surface area \noccupied by each molecule close to its cross-sectional area, producing a solid phase in which the \nmolecules are densely packed and in which the molecules form an ordered array. From this phase, \nthe molecules may be transferred to a solid substrate, forming an LB film1,2. LB films may consist \nof a single chemical species, this homogeneity not being available to the ESA method, which \nrequires alternate layers of oppositely charged materials as will be discussed in section 2.3. \n \n2.2.1 Deposition of Langmuir-Blodgett Films \nAn LB film can be deposited by passing a solid substrate such as a glass slide or optical fibre \nvertically through a condensed Langmuir layer. The surface pressure is monitored and kept constant \nduring deposition by decreasing the surface area as the molecules are removed from the subphase \nand deposited on the substrate, ensuring that the solid phase is maintained. The vertical motion can \nbe either down into the water (downstroke), or up, out of the water (upstroke). If the surface of the \nsubstrate is prepared such that it is hydrophilic, the first monolayer is transferred like a carpet as the \nsubstrate is raised through the Langmuir layer. The curve of the meniscus pushes the compressed \nmonolayer onto the substrate. On the downstroke, the hydrophobic tail groups of the floating \nmonolayer are attracted to those of the deposited LB film, thus depositing a second layer. Repeated \ndipping allows the film to be built one layer at a time, using these nanoscale building blocks. This \nrepresents the most common configuration, and is illustrated in figure 2 (a), with the adjacent layers \npacking head to head and tail to tail, and the overall film is termed Y-type or centrosymmetric4.  \n \n 6 \nA small number of materials can be deposited as either X- or Z-type, non centrosymmetric, LB \nfilms, offering the possibility of exploring non-linear optical processes such as second harmonic \ngeneration, and the electro-optic effect5,6,7. In these cases, layers are only deposited on the \ndownstroke (X-type), or upstroke (Z-type) of the substrate, as illustrated in figure 2 (b). \n \n2.3 Electrostatic Self Assembly \nESA is a technique for the deposition of multilayered films of magnetic8, electrically conductive9, \nand nonlinear optical materials10 onto a substrate. The basis of the technique is the alternate dipping \nof a charged substrate into solutions of cationic and anionic polymers.  The growth of the film is \nbased on electrostatic attraction between the opposite charges of molecules in alternate \nmonolayers11.  \n \nThe ESA process is shown schematically in figure 3. A positively charged surface is immersed in a \nsolution containing an anionic polyelectrolyte. A monolayer of the polyanion is adsorbed and the \nsurface charge is reversed. The substrate is rinsed in pure water and is subsequently immersed in \nthe solution containing the cationic polyelectrolyte. A second monolayer is adsorbed, and the \noriginal surface charge is restored. By repeating these steps, alternating multilayer films may be \ndeposited11.  \n \nThe LB and ESA techniques offer a number of different features. For ESA, multilayer formation is \nbased on the attraction of opposite charges. This it is possible to incorporate more than two \nmolecules into the multilayer, simply by immersing the substrate in as many solutions of \npolyeletrolytes, or appropriately charged inorganic nano-clusters, as desired, provided the charge \nreverses from layer to layer. Aperiodic multilayer assemblies may be prepared, offering more \nversatility than the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. Thus the individual layer composition and \nthickness can be controlled, and the properties of the film are determined by the polymers, the \n 7 \nnano-particles and the long-range physical order of the layers. The immersion based process \nfacilitates deposition on substrates of various sizes, shapes and materials, including metals, plastics, \nceramics and semiconductors12.  \n \n3 COUPLED WAVEGUIDE DEVICES \n3.1 Introduction \nFibre optic components based upon coupled waveguides have been studied extensively, and many \nstandard fibre optic components, for example, directional couplers, are based upon this principle. \nThe principle of operation concerns the transfer of energy between two dielectric waveguides, \nwhich occurs when the waveguides are in close proximity to one another, such that the evanescent \nfields of the propagating modes can interact when the waveguides are phase matched.   \n \nA thin film overlay deposited onto a substrate that is an optical waveguide may itself act as a \nwaveguide, provided its index is higher than that of the substrate. The phase matching condition is \ndependent upon parameters including the dimensions and refractive indices of the two waveguides \nand is given by \n \ncoameffnndm\n\u03a6+\u03a6+=\u2212 \u03c0\u03bb\n\u03c0 22\n0\n2\n \n(1) \n \n \nWhere neff is the effective index of the mode propagating in the substrate, d is the thickness of the \noverlay, n0 is the refractive index of the overlay, \u0424a and \u0424co are polarisation dependent phase \nchange terms occurring at the air and substrate boundaries and \u03bbm is the synchronous wavelength \nfor coupling to the mth order mode of the overlay waveguide. In the presence of strong differential \nwaveguide dispersion between the guides, this produces a series of sharp channel dropping \nresponses in the transmission spectrum (discussed further in section 3.3). The coupling wavelength \n 8 \nis particularly sensitive to changes in the overlay thickness and so very accurate thickness control, \nas provided by the LB and ESA techniques, is required.  \n \nIn the case of the devices to be discussed here, the coupled waveguides are formed by the core of \nthe optical fibre and an overlay waveguide deposited on the optical fibre by the LB technique. \nAccess to the evanescent field of the propagating mode of a single mode optical fibre requires \nremoval of much of the cladding. This is generally achieved by tapering the optical fibre13, or by \npolishing the fibre14.  \n \n3.2 Polished Fibre Devices \nTwo polishing configurations are illustrated in figures 4 (a) and (b). In figure 4 (a) the optical fibre \nis first stripped of its polymer buffer jacket over a length of 15mm and is subsequently fixed into a \ngroove with a 250 mm radius of curvature cut into a glass block. Material is then removed from the \ntop surface of the block using a rotary polishing machine. The technique is used in the fabrication \nof fibre components such as variable split ratio directional couplers14 and in fibre polarisers15. This \ntechnique has limitations for LB deposition, as the fibre interaction region occupies only a small \nfraction of the total surface area, and thus the majority of the film does not contribute to the \ninteraction. The typical interaction length between the core and the overlay waveguide achieved \nusing this technique is limited to 1-2mm. In addition, the differential polishing rates of the glass \nsubstrate, the silica fibre and the adhesives used to bond the fibre into the groove can also \ncompromise the film deposition16. \n \nAn alternative method, the annular polishing technique17, is illustrated in figure 4 (b).  The fibre is \ntensioned across a 25mm diameter abrasive wheel. The polished fibre profile can be seen to afford a \nlonger interaction length, of 5mm \u2013 10mm, defined by the diameter of the wheel and the \nconfiguration of the tensioned fibre. \n 9 \n \nMonitoring the polishing depth is critical to obtaining optimum performance of the polished fibre \ndevice. The oil drop method18,19 is commonly used, where a drop of refractive index matching oil is \nplaced in the polished region, and its influence on the transmission of the fibre measured. If the \nrefractive index of the oil matches the index of the propagating core mode, the electric field \npropagating in the overlay formed by the oil changes its characteristic from evanescent to radiative, \nwith a concomitant decrease in the transmitted power. The decrease in transmission is strongly \ninfluenced by the thickness of the remaining cladding. From the transmission measurement it is \npossible to determine the amount to the evanescent field that has been accessed through the \npolishing process, and to determine the coupling strength. \n \nAn alternative technique involves operating the optical fibre below its cut off wavelength, such that \nit guides a small number of modes. As the polishing depth increases, these modes will be cut off in \nturn, leading to a series of step reductions in the transmitted power20.  \n \nThe polished block approach and LB film deposition have been used to form a fibre optic polariser \nand modulator21. In this case, an LB film of Cadmium Stearate (molecular length 2.5 nm) was \ndeposited on a gold-coated single mode side polished optical fibre. The thickness of the LB film \ninfluenced the properties of the surface plasmon resonance based polariser, allowing optimisation \nof the extinction ratio for a film of thickness 500nm. Application of dc electric fields of upto \n50MV\/m across an LB film consisting of 41 layers of hemicyanine deposited onto a gold surface, \nupon which a gold film was sputtered to form the top electrode, allowed limited tuning of the \nextinction ratio21,22. \n \n Channel dropping filters \n 10 \nAn example of a channel dropping filter is shown in figure 5, where an LB film of \u03c9-tricosenoic \nacid was deposited onto a single mode optical fibre polished using the rotary method23,24. Each \ntransmission spectrum was obtained for a different number of LB layers deposited into the fibre. \nThe graph shows that an increase in the film thickness by a molecular bi-layer (~ 5.8 nm) results in \na change in the coupling wavelength of ~ 14 nm.  This illustrates the requirement for the use of a \nfilm deposition technique with a nano-scale thickness resolution for the fabrication of such \ncomponents, to ensure operation at a specified wavelength. \n \nA second consequence of the high sensitivity of the coupling wavelength upon the overlay\u2019s \nthickness is a concomitant dependence upon the refractive index of the material. Thus if the \nmaterial changes its optical properties in response to an external stimulus, for example, exposure to \na particular chemical species, or an applied voltage, this will also result in a shift in the synchronous \nwavelength, forming the basis of a sensor. \n \nFigure 6 illustrates the sensitivity of the channel dropping response to temperature. This sensitivity \narises from the differential thermo-optic coefficients, and thus temperature induced refractive index \nchanges, of the optical fibre and the overlay waveguide24. \n \nThe ability of the LB film to act as a waveguide was used to capture fluorescence from a cyanine-\ndye-impregnated film of cadmium arachidate deposited on the core of a multimode optical fibre that \nformed one arm of a 3dB coupler. The fluorescence was re-coupled into the fibre, and monitored in \nreflection, as shown in figure 725.  \n \n3.4 Chemical sensor \nA pH sensor was demonstrated by depositing LB film-forming materials known to be sensitive to \npH, taken from the family of merocyanine dyes, onto a side polished optical fibre. Merocyanine \nDeleted: \u00b6\nDeleted: Page Break\n 11 \ndyes contain a terminal oxygen atom that can be reversibly protonated, leading to a change in the \nabsorption spectrum and thus a change in its refractive index. Two dyes were investigated. The \nabsorption spectrum of 20 molecular layers of the first dye,  E-N-docosyl-4-[2-(4-oxyphenyl) \nethenyl] pyridinium inner salt (structure shown in figure 8(a)), deposited onto a glass slide, is \nshown in figure 8(b) before and after exposure to HCl vapour26,27. A channel dropping filter with a \ncoupling wavelength of 725 nm was created by depositing 56 layers of the dye on an annularly \npolished fibre (cut-off wavelength of 630 nm). A schematic of the device is shown in figure 9. The \nresponse of the transmission spectrum of the device to exposure to solutions of varying pH yielded \nis shown in figure 10 (a), yeilding a linear response with a sensitivity of 18.8 \u00b1 0.8 nm\/pH and a \nresolution of 0.1 pH , as shown in figure 10 (b). The organic materials that may be deposited using \nthe LB technique may be tailored to satisfy specific purposes. A second dye was investigated that \nhas its absorption at longer wavelengths. The use of this dye would result in larger refractive index \nin the near infrared region of the spectrum, increasing sensitivity. This dye differed from the \noriginal by the addition of bromine atoms and replacing one carbon atom on the ethylene bridge \nwith a nitrogen atom, Figure 11 (a). The response of the absorption spectrum to exposure to HCl \nvapour is shown in Figure 11 (b)27. 178 layers of the 2nd dye were deposited on an annularly \npolished fibre. The response to pH is shown in figure 12 (a). In this case, the wavelength shift of the \ncentral wavelength of the channel dropping response was nonlinear, as shown in figure 12 (b). A \nKramers-Kronig model, in which experimentally determined transmission spectra of 50 layers of \nthe dye deposited onto a glass slide recorded on exposure to solutions of differing pH were used to \ndetermine changes in the material dispersion of the overlay waveguide, was found to match well \nwith the experimental results, as indicated by the solid line in figure 12(b) 27.  \n \n3.5 Optically non-linear nano-structured coatings \nAs discussed in section 3.1, LB films may be deposited with a non-centrosymmetric structure, \noffering the possibility of exploiting non-linear optical processes, such as the electro-optic effect. \n 12 \nThis is particularly appealing, as LB film forming materials have been shown to have high non-\nlinear coefficients, with Pockels\u2019 coefficients of 100pm\/V being reported28. These materials may be \ndeposited as Z-type LB films onto both glass slide and side polished single mode optical fibres, and \ncharacterised as non-linear materials by investigating second harmonic generation. \nThe first demonstration of SHG from a LB film deposited on an optical fibre was reported in [29]. \nA film of a hemicyanine dye was deposited in a Z-type configuration onto the core of an etched 600 \n\u03bcm diameter multi-mode optical fibre. A conversion efficiency of 10-6 was achieved for 80 layers of \nthe dye when illuminated using  a pulsed Nd:YAG laser source coupled into the fibre. The SHG \nsignal was guided in the film, and the low value was attributed to the likely phase mismatch of the \nfundamental and SHG, and to the low energy density offered by the use of multimode fibreError! \nBookmark not defined..  \n \nTo improve the efficiency of coupling of light to the film, an optically nonlinear dye, E-N-\noctadecyl-4-[2-(4-dibutylaminophenyl) ethenyl]quinolinium octadecylsulfate30, which inherently \nforms Z-type structures and has a high nonlinear coefficient, was deposited on a side polished \nsingle mode optical fibre31.  The channel dropping response of the coupled waveguide structure was \nmonitored during deposition of the LB film until it was centred at 1064nm, the wavelength of the \nlaser used as the pump for the SHG process. The resultant channel dropping response is shown in \nfigure 13. For Z-type, non-centrosymmetric deposition, it is necessary for the monolayer to be \ntransferred to the surface of the polished section of the fibre on the upstroke only. To achieve this in \na consistent and reproducible fashion, a mechanism was developed to isolate the fibre from the \nfloating Langmuir monolayer as it traverses the air\u2013water interface32, using a cylindrical stainless \nsteel tube that temporarily enclosed the fibre on the downstroke. \n \n 13 \nCerenkov radiation-type phase matching was exploited as this imposes the least stringent control of \nthe parameters for frequency conversion33. In this regime, the fundamental beam is guided in the \nLB film and the generated second-harmonic is radiated into the substrate, as shown in figure 14. \n \nLight from a Q-switched Nd: YAG laser, operating at 1064 nm with a pulse duration of 10 ns was \ncoupled into the optical fibre.  The second-harmonic intensity relative to the signal from a Y-cut \nquartz reference was monitored via photomultiplier tubes. The energy of the guided fundamental \npump beam exiting the fibre was monitored continuously. \n \nThe region of fibre coated with the LB film was mounted on a Peltier thermoelectric element to \nallow thermal control of the resonant wavelength, \u03bbm, and hence the amount of light coupled into \nthe overlay. The second-harmonic intensity from the LB overlay is plotted as a function of fibre \ntransmission in figure 15. Increased transmission is indicative of reduced coupling into the overlay \nand the second-harmonic intensity decreases as the square of the transmitted fundamental intensity. \nVarying the optical power coupled into the fibre, and therefore to the overlay, shown in figure 16. \nThe slope is positive and, as expected from theory, the second-harmonic intensity increases as the \nsquare of the fundamental intensity. \n \n4 OPTICAL FIBRE LONG PERIOD GRATINGS \n4.1 Introduction \nThe devices discussed in the previous section relied upon the removal of a portion of the fibre \ncladding to allow the properties of the overlay material to influence the transmission characteristics \nof the optical fibre. Fibre optic long period gratings (LPGs) offer a method for facilitating the \ninteraction of modes of the fibre with the LB coating with no requirement for removal of the \ncladding. LPGs are a relatively new class of fibre optic device that offer exciting properties for \noptical sensing applications34 and have already found application as gain flattening filters for \n 14 \nerbium amplifiers. An LPG is an UV induced periodic modulation of the refractive index of the \ncore of an optical fibre, with a period in the range 100 \u03bcm - 1000 \u03bcm. The small grating wave-\nvector of an LPG promotes the coupling of light from the guided modes of the fibre to cladding \nmodes, with the result that the transmission spectrum of a fibre containing an LPG consists of a \nnumber of attenuation bands centred at discrete wavelengths34.  \n \nThe transmission spectrum of an LPG is shown in figure 1735, exhibiting the characteristic \nattenuation bands. The exact form of the spectrum and the centre wavelengths of the attenuation \nbands are sensitive to the local environment: temperature, strain, bend radius and refractive index of \nthe medium surrounding the fibre36. The sensitivity to a particular measurand is dependent upon the \nperiod of the LPG and the order of the cladding mode to which the guided optical power is coupled, \nand thus is different for each attenuation band. This range of responses makes them particularly \nattractive for sensor applications, with the prospect for multi-parameter sensing using a single \nsensor element.  \n \nLPGs have a number of attractive properties that may be exploited for sensing applications. They \nexhibit sensitivity to the refractive index of the medium surrounding the fibre, which has been \nexploited to form sensors capable of measuring the refractive index of a solution, allowing \nconcentrations of sodium chloride and ethylene glycol to be determined37. Such sensors are not \nchemical species specific, and are limited to operation with solutions with refractive indices less \nthan or equal to the refractive index of the fiber cladding. Of more interest is the potential to deposit \noverlay materials that exhibit changes in their refractive index in response to their local \nenvironment. In this way, the LPG could form, for example, a tuneable loss filter38, a temperature \ninsensitive filter39 or a species-specific chemical sensor40.  \n  \n4.2 Deposition of Nanostructured Coatings onto Fibre Optic Long Period Gratings \n 15 \nThe central wavelengths and the minimum transmission of the LPG attenuation bands can exhibit a \ndependence on both the thickness and refractive index of an overlay material, even when the \noverlay has a refractive index higher than that of the cladding41.  \n \nThe spectral response of an LPG of length 40 mm, period 400 \u03bcm, to submersion in external media \nof different refractive indices is shown in figure 18, were the refractive index induced wavelength \nshift of the central wavelength of an attenuation band in the spectrum is plotted. The figure shows \nthat the response to refractive index occurs over a range of approximately 1.400 to 1.456. The upper \nlimit is imposed by the refractive index of the cladding material. For refractive indices above this \nlimit there is no wavelength response.  \n \nAn LB film of \u03c9 tricosenoic acid, which has refractive index of 1.57 and a molecular length of 2.6 \nnm42, was deposited onto the optical fibre containing the LPG. A transmission spectrum was \nrecorded after each bi-layer had been deposited. \n \nThe wavelengths of the 4th, 5th and 6th attenuation bands are plotted as a function of overlay \nthickness in figure 19 (a). Figure 19 (b) shows the shift in the central wavelengths of the attenuation \nbands corresponding to coupling to the 5th and 6th cladding modes plotted as a function of the \nthickness of the film. The graph contains three distinct regions characterized by differences in the \nform and response of the transmission spectrum. The graph shows that for an overlay thickness of \nless than 250 nm, (region A), the attenuation band suffers a wavelength shift of ~ 5 nm. For an \noverlay thickness of between 250 nm and 380 nm, (region B), the amplitude of the attenuation \nbands in the transmission spectrum reduced to zero and thus no coupling wavelengths could be \nrecorded. For an overlay thickness of over 380 nm, (region C), the attenuation bands reappeared, \nbut at a wavelength higher than originally observed in the absence of the overlay material. As the \n 16 \nfilm thickness was increased further, the central wavelengths of the attenuation band returned \ntowards their original value.  \n \nSimilar effects have been observed for thin films deposited via the ESA technique43,44. Larger \nwavelength shifts, of upto 40nm, were observed for films of thickness 25nm, formed using \nPoly(allylamine hydrochloride as the polycation, and poly{1-[4-(3-carboxy-4-hydroxy-phenylazo) \nbenzenesulfonamido]-1,2- ethanediyl, sodium salt} was used as polyanion43. The larger wavelength \nshifts may be attributed to operating at longer wavelengths, and with the use of films of higher \nrefractive index. It was also shown that careful control of the properties of the anion and cation \nallows control over the thickness and refractive index of the film and thus of the wavelength of the \nattenuation bands43. \n \nThe dependence of the central wavelengths of the attenuation bands upon the thickness and \nrefractive index of the overlay has been modelled41. The effective refractive indices of the cladding \nmodes were calculated as a function of wavelength and overlay thickness by considering the \ncladding-overlay system as a stack of thin films and employing the transfer matrix method45. The \neffective refractive index of the propagating core mode was calculated using the approach of \nGloge46.  Using the calculated dispersion of the core and cladding modes, the dependence of the \ncentral wavelengths of the LPG attenuation bands upon overlay thickness could be predicted. The \nmodel makes a number of approximations, in particular that the system may be modeled as a \nmultilayer planar waveguide, and ignores the influence of the coupling efficiency between core and \ncladding modes upon the coupling wavelength and the depth of the attenuation bands. The model \ndoes however qualitatively predict the experimentally observed behaviour; however, this approach \nsuffers from a number of limitations which result from the approximations made. The theoretical \nprediction of the variation of wavelength as a function of overlay thickness is illustrated in figure \n 17 \n20(a)41. As for the experimental results, if the order of the attenuation band is ignored, the \nwavelength shifts appear to be continuous as observed experimentally in figure 19 (a).  \n \nMore rigorous theoretical treatments have provided similar predictions 43,47,48,49 where the LPG is \nmodeled using coupled mode theory, and in reference 50, where a step index waveguide geometry \nis modeled. Using a linearly polarised (LP), weakly guiding approximation, it has been shown that, \nas thickness of an overlay of refractive index higher than that of the cladding is increased, the \noverlay, itself a waveguide, become capable of guiding one of the cladding modes. During the \ntransition to guidance, the effective index of the cladding mode varies rapidly, as evidenced by the \nrapid change in wavelength of the attenuation bands. In the absence of losses, i.e. an imaginary part \nof the refractive index, in the overlay it is the cladding mode with highest effective index (i.e. \nlowest order) that is guided. The transition is also characterized by a reorganization of the cladding \nmodes in region B of figure 19 (b). The effective indices of the cladding modes are then increased \nto that of their nearest lower order mode in the absence of the overlay, as illustrated in figure 21. \nFurther increases in overlay thickness cause this process to repeat43.  \n \nThe LP approximation presented does not predict the disappearance of the attenuation bands unless \nthe overlay exhibits a complex refractive index. In this case the attenuation of the cladding modes is \npredicted to increase rapidly in the transition region, which reduces the efficiency of coupling \nbetween core and cladding modes, and, as a result, reduces the extinction of the attenuation bands47. \nIn this case, it is not necessarily the lowest order cladding mode that is guided, and the modal \nreorganization is more complex. Attenuation bands corresponding to coupling to higher order \ncladding modes than that which is guided by the overlay shift to the immediate lower order \ncladding-mode resonance condition. Attenuation bands corresponding to coupling to cladding \nmodes of order lower than that which is guided initially suffer a blue shift before recovering their \noriginal resonance wavelength. Extension to consider the hybrid modes shows that, within one LP \nField Code Changed\nFormatted: Not Highlight\nFormatted: Not Highlight\nField Code Changed\nFormatted: Highlight\nDeleted: 43\nDeleted:  \nDeleted:  linear\nDeleted: 43\nDeleted: 47\n 18 \nmode transition, there are EH and HE mode transitions49. Thus, for lower order cladding mode \ntransitions in situations where the weakly guiding approximation is not valid, a two step transition \nis observed.  \n \nThe simplistic model discussed previously can be used to predict the response of the attenuation \nbands\u2019 central wavelengths to deposition of films of differing index, as illustrated in figure 22. It \ncan be seen that, as the index of the overlay material increases, the region of high sensitivity moves \nto lower thicknesses. It is possible to predict the significant sensitivity of the attenuation bands to \nchanges in the refractive index of the overlay, assuming a constant overlay thickness, as shown in \nfigure 23. This indicates the potential for developing sensors based upon nm scale coatings that \nchange their refractive index in response to an external stimulus.  \n \nThe use of LPGs as refractive index sensors, to determine the concentration of aqueous solutions is \nwell established37.  The model described above predicts that the sensitivity of an LPG refractometer \ncan be enhanced by the deposition of a nanometer scale overlay, with the degree of enhancement \ndependent upon the refractive index and thickness of the overlay. This has recently been \ndemonstrated experimentally, using films deposited by the LB and ESA techniques52,53.  \n \nThe wavelength shifts offer many new prospects for optical fiber sensor configurations. Of \nparticular interest is the transition from region A to region C, since this introduces a large \nwavelength shift for a small change in the optical thickness of the overlay. If a film of appropriate \nthickness is deposited, then a small refractive index change could cause a large wavelength shift, \noffering the prospect of developing a highly sensitive sensor, or an optical modulator. This has been \nexploited by dip-coating the nanoporous crystalline \u03b4 from of Syndiotactic Polystyrene (sPS) onto \nan LPG. sPS can reversibly adsorb  analytes of suitable size and shape, with a concomitant change \nin refractive index. The sensor was shown to be capable of sub-ppm detection of chloroform in \nDeleted: 49\nDeleted: i\nDeleted: This has been exploited \nby dip-coating the nanoporous \ncrystalline \u03b4 from of Syndiotactic \nPolystyrene (sPS) onto an LPG. \nsPS can reversibly adsorb  analytes \nof suitable size and shape, with a \nconcomitant change in refractive \nindex. The sensor was shown to be \ncapable of sub-ppm detection of \nchloroform in water. The authors \ndemonstrated that appropriate \nchoice of  overlay thickness allows \noptimisation of response time and \nsensitivity of the device51.\n 19 \nwater. The authors demonstrated that appropriate choice of  overlay thickness allows optimisation \nof response time and sensitivity of the device54. \n \nConcatenated or in-series LPGs allow the production of finer detail within the transmission \nspectrum55. The concatenated LPGs act as a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, as illustrated in figure \n24. Light coupled into the cladding by the first LPG is re-coupled into the core by the second LPG, \nwhere it interferes with the light that propagated in the core, producing interference fringes within \nthe attenuation bands, as illustrated in figure 25. The deposition of a nano-structured film onto \nconcatenated LPGs has been reported56. Films deposited on the length of optical fibre separating the \nLPGs affect only the interference fringes, while films deposited along the entire device influence \nboth the fringes and the attenuation band envelope. Figure 26 shows the response of the \ntransmission spectrum to the LB deposition of a film of \u03c9-tricosenoic acid onto a 20mm length of \nfibre separating two identical LPGs of period 400 \u03bcm and length 5mm. The initial blue shift of the \nfringes is followed by a reduction in visibility, corresponding to region B of figure 19 (b), and by a \nsubsequent reappearance of the fringes56. \n \n5. Sub-micron Fabry-Perot interferometers formed using nanostructured coatings \nSub-micron Fabry-Perot interferometers formed at the end of optical fibres have been used as low-\nmass low-cost one time sensors for gases such as ozone on Mars57, and elsewhere as sensor \nelements for a range of measurands including temperature, vibration and pressure58. Several \nmethods have been reported for the fabrication of an optical cavity on the end of an optical fibre \nsuch as vapour deposition of metals59. A constraint of the all-metallic sensing elements is their \ninherent limitation compared with the sensing capabilities of organic materials. Also, in general it is \ndifficult to obtain high precision in the film thickness for short cavities (< 2 \u03bcm).  These limitations \nhave been overcome using the LB60 and ESA61 deposition techniques, demonstrating thickness \ncontrol of ca. 3-5 nm layer-1 to a total film thickness of 1 \u03bcm in the formation of Fabry-Perot type \nDeleted: 55\nInserted: 55\nDeleted: 54\nDeleted: Page Break\nDeleted: \u00b6\n 20 \ninterferometric optical cavities on the end of the optical fibre in which the optical fiber\/ film \ninterface formed the first mirror, and the film\/air interface formed the second mirror, as shown in \nfigure 27. \n \nTo facilitate the fabrication of a Fabry-Perot type interferometric optical cavity using the LB \ntechnique, the LB trough dipper mechanism was modified to allow the film to be deposited on the \ncleaved end face of the optical fibre.  For the ESA technique, the cavity was formed by alternately \ndipping the end of the fibre in a solution of poly(sodium 4-styrene-sulfonate) salt and a solution of \ngold colloids in polydiallyldimethyl-ammonium chloride, washing in pure water between61. \n  \nIn general, if the molecular length is l and the number of bilayers is m, then the cavity length is d = \n2 m l cos \u03c6 where \u03c6 is the tilt angle of the molecules when deposited onto the substrate. The optical \nphase change experienced by light undergoing a double pass through the cavity is \n \n\u03bb\nd 2n  \u03c04 \u03c6 =\n \n( 2) \n \nwhere \u03c6 is the free space wavelength of the source and n2 is the refractive index of the cavity. \n \nThe fabricated cavity has low reflectance at M1, due to the small difference in refractive index \nbetween the fibre and the cavity material, and thus acts similarly to a two beam interferometer, \nwhere the transfer function will be cosinusoidal, of the form \n \n( )\u03c6cosV1II\n0\n+\u2248\n ( 3) \n \nwhere V is the visibility. \nDeleted: 60\nInserted: 60\nDeleted: 59\n 21 \n \nIn the case of LB deposited cavities, the cavity material, \u03c9\uf02d tricosenoic acid, was transferred on to \nthe end of the fiber by vertical deposition, with the fibre\u2019s cleaved face orthogonal to the plane of \nthe film, using a modified dipper mechanism. Y-type structures, in which the amphiphilic \nmolecules pack head-to-head and tail-to-tail, were obtained by multiple passes through the film. \n \nThe experimental layout shown in figure 28 was used to monitor the formation of the cavity, the \nlight source being a super-luminescent diode with a central wavelength of 830 nm and a 3 dB \nbandwidth of 30 nm. This was coupled to the cavity via a 3 dB directional coupler using single \nmode optical fibre with cut-off wavelength 730 nm. As the cavities formed were of the order of 1 \n\u03bcm in length, a broad band source with a coherence length of 15 \u03bcm was sufficient to monitor their \nfabrication. The optical power of the source and the reflected signal from the cavity were monitored \non separate matched photo-detectors. Following the deposition of each bilayer, at an incremental \nthickness of ca. 3 nm, the ratio of the reflected to incident intensity was recorded. This ratio is \nplotted versus number of bilayers in figure 29. The reflected signal varies periodically with the \ncavity thickness, showing the interferometric nature of the cavity.  \n \nAs reported for cavities formed using ESA61, figure 29 shows some attenuation with cavity \nthickness as a result of absorption and scattering within the film. There is some asymmetry, \npossibly resulting from incomplete deposition of the multilayer. The low visibility of the fringes is a \nresult of the small difference in refractive index difference between the LB\/fibre and LB\/ air \ninterfaces, and also due to scattering loses in the cavity. Higher visibility has been demonstrated \nusing the ESA technique, using films of higher refractive index. \n \nKnowledge of the dispersion of the material would allow the cavity to be monitored at different \nwavelengths and thus facilitate signal processing of the cavity when deployed as a sensing element. \nDeleted: 59\n 22 \nThe facility to control the optical thickness of the cavity on a nanometer scale permits the formation \nof high spatial resolution optical fiber sensors and the potential for sensors with fast response times. \nIn addition, the film-forming materials may be designed to change their optical characteristics when \nreacting to a particular chemical species, or, in the case of LB films, form non-centrosymmetric \nfilms that exhibit non-linear optical properties, opening up the potential for high spatial resolution \nsensing based on non-linear optics.  \n \nA sub-mcron cavity fabricated via the ESA technique was used to demonstrate a humidity sensor. A \nsolution of poly (sodium 4-styrene-sulfonate) salt (PSS) formed the anionic electrolyte. A solution \nof gold colloids protected by a polymer coating, poly (diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride) \n(PDDA), was used to form the cationic electrolyte (Au:PDDA). A bi-layer structure of thickness \n309 nm with the form [Au:PDDA+\/PSS\u2212] was deposited on the endface of an optical fibre. The \noperation of the sensor was not based upon the interferometric nature of the cavity. Rather, the \nhygroscopic property of the coating material was exploited. The trapping of water drops at the \nsurface of the coating, the size of which is dependent on the RH, resulted in changes in the \nreflectivity of the end mirror of the cavity12,62. The sensor showed reversible operation over the \nrelative humidity range 11.3% to 100%, with a response time of 1.5 s, making it suitable for \nmonitoring human respiration. The affinity of dichloromethane to a polymer coating composed of \npoly (diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDDA) and the dye Poly S-119 has been used in a \nsimilar way to form a dichloromethane sensor. Here the change in the reflected optical power was \nachieved by the capture of drops of dichloromethane on the coating63. LB films have been \nemployed in similar configurations. The reflection from a lutetium bisphthalocyanine film \ndeposited onto the end of an optical fibre was monitored when exposed to acetic acid, ethanol, n-\nbutyl acetate and hexanal64. ESA has been used to demonstrate an ammonia sensor based upon thin \nfilms of zirconia (ZrO2) nanoclusters and poly(sodium-4-styrenesulfonate) salt deposited on the \n 23 \ncleaved ends of optical fibres65. The sensor was unaffected by humidity and the presence of volatile \norganic compounds. \n \n A hydrogen peroxide H2O2 sensor was formed by mixing an indicator dye, Prussian blue, in the \npolycation layer. The operation of the sensor relied upon measurement of the rate of change of the \nreflected intensity, which was related to the change in the absorbance of the indicator caused by the \ndiffusion of the H2O2 into the nanostructure. A cavity of thickness 17 bilayers were found to \nprovide the optimum sensitivity, and a capping layer was used to prevent loss of the indicator \ndye66,67. \n \nThe ability of ESA to form multilayer coatings using more than two different materials has allowed \nthe fabrication of filters formed from quarter-wavelength stacks on the end faces of cleaved and \npolished optical fibres68. Such structures formed on the end of multi-mode fibre have been used to \nbias the operating wavelength of the sensor, and to thus allow the possibility of wavelength division \nmultiplexing of sensor arrays68.   \n \nSUMMARY \nThe properties of fibre optic devices employing nano-structured coatings have been reviewed. The \ndeposition of active and passive coatings using the Langmuir Blodgett and Electro-static Self \nAssembly techniques, have been described.  Their use to form coupled waveguides and miniature \nFabry-Perot cavities, and their use to influence the transmission spectra of fibre optic long period \ngratings has been detailed. The ability to manipulate material deposition onto optical fibres at the \nnanoscale has lead to a new class of passive and active photonic devices with exciting potential in \nsensing and signal processing for future sensor and communication systems. \n \nDeleted: 67\nInserted: 67\nDeleted: 66\n 24 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors would like to acknowledge the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, \nEPSRC, UK and the Royal Society for their support. \n 25 \nREFERENCES\n \n1  I.R Peterson, Langmuir-Blodgett films, J.Phys.
