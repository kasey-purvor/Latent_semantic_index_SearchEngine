Introduction \n \nSince the first prehistoric people started to dig for stone to make implements, rather than pick \nup loose material, humans have modified the landscape through excavation of rock and soil, \ngeneration of waste and creation of artificial ground. It is estimated that the worldwide \ndeliberate annual shift of material by human activity is 57 000 M tonnes and exceeds that of \ntransport by rivers to the oceans (22 000 M tonnes) almost by a factor of three (Douglas & \nLawson 2001). Humans sculpt and transform the landscape through the physical modification \nof the shape and properties of the ground surface and subsurface. As such, humans are \ngeological and geomorphological agents and the dominant factor in landscape evolution in \nthe Anthropocene (Zalasiewicz et al. 2008; Zalasiewicz et al. 2010). The magnitude of impact \n(quantity and spatial extent) of material moved and its rate correlate with increasing \npopulation. The exploitation of the landscape and its subsurface to meet the needs of society \nis driven by changes in socioeconomic, technological, political and cultural parameters.  \nThe geological and geomorphological impact of these changes is reflected in the \ndeposition of made ground, removal of material through excavation, enhanced denudation \nthrough agricultural activity and the disruption of natural sediment transfer through dam \nconstruction for example. The former two processes represent the deliberate actions of \nhumans to extract, transfer, re-use or discard rock, soil and man-made materials. This \ncontrasts with the latter two processes where the impacts on sediments and sediment transfer \nare the unintentional consequence of anthropogenic processes where movement of sediment \nwas not the primary objective. Anthropogenic processes where rock or soil is deliberately \nexcavated, transported and deposited by people include: mining (subsurface and opencast), \nconstruction for settlement, industry, burial and defensive purposes, processing of metal ore, \nwaste generation and canal, road and railway infrastructure construction. Unintentional \nactivity relates to a combination of aeolian, hydrological and slope erosional processes \nrelated to soil loss and transport through agricultural modification of the landscape for \npasture and arable land. Although both intentional and unintentional processes result in \nsignificant sedimentary markers on which the Anthropocene may be characterised, it is the \ndeliberate, anthropogenic processes on which this paper focuses.  \nWidespread industrial activity and urbanization accelerated during the Industrial \nRevolution and is associated with increased input of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane \n(CH4) into the atmosphere. It is proposed that this may represent a significant atmospheric \nmarker defining the Anthropocene Epoch (Steffen et al. 2007; Zalasiewicz et al. 2008). \nHowever, the deliberate modification of the landscape to support human habitation and \nculture through resource exploitation, construction, demolition and deposition of wastes \nprovides a sedimentological basis for defining the Anthropocene. Such sedimentological \nanthropogenic processes and their impacts are most significant during and after the Industrial \nRevolution in the late 18th century (Figure 1). This period represents significant population \ngrowth, industrialisation and large scale exploitation of subsurface resources. This subsurface \nsignature in the sedimentary record may provide a physical basis on which to characterise the \nAnthropocene.  However, on a smaller scale, landscape transforming anthropogenic \nprocesses occurred before the 18th century and the onset of widespread industrialisation.     \n Evidence for burning in upland areas and the discovery of middens, especially near \nthe coasts of Great Britain in the Mesolithic, suggests landscape modification may have \nbegun at this time. However, its spatial extent and the volume of material moved is likely to \nhave been limited in Great Britain. Evidence of significant deliberate landscape modification \nis recognised as early as the Neolithic as people transformed their cultural way of life from \nhunter gatherers to farming and settlement. Trade of goods may have also taken place at this \ntime reflecting early exploitation of subsurface resources of quality flint for tool making. \nDeliberate, landscape transformation through mineral exploitation, processing and waste \ngeneration gathered pace during the Bronze Age.  It is around this time that transformation of \nthe landscape increased and humans became geological and geomorphological agents through \nthe deliberate removal, transport and placement of sediment. This deliberate, anthropogenic \nmodification of the sedimentological record may provide a marker for the onset of the \nAnthropocene, although on this basis, its onset is likely to be diachronous.  \nThe Roman occupation of Great Britain marked a time of population centralisation in \ntowns and cities. Subsequent successive phases of urban expansion acted as the driver for \nincreased landscape modification within these towns, cities and on the surrounding landscape \nwhich provided the resources to support their development. Although the timing of this is \nlikely to be diachronous, it may be possible to define the Anthropocene on the basis of \nanthropogenic geological and geomorphological landscape transformation around this time. \nHuman activity and land use change has left an imprint above and below the land in \nthe form of artificial ground. Artificial ground includes areas where material is known to \nhave been placed by humans on the pre-existing natural land surface (including engineered \nfill) and areas where the pre-existing land surface is known to have been excavated. It can be \na ground hazard, an archaeological heritage deposit and a potential mineral resource where \neconomic conditions permit. Deposited in the shallow subsurface through historical and \ncurrent anthropogenic activity, it forms part of a shallow zone of human interaction and has \nbecome part of the geological record from which the Anthropocene can be characterised. Due \nto its deposition in predominantly terrestrial environments, the long-term geological \npreservation potential of artificial ground is uncertain. \nBy understanding the physical impacts of historical and current changes in urban and \nrural land use, it may be possible to predict the resilience and future response of the Earth\u2019s \nshallow subsurface to environmental change. \n \n2. Humans as geological and geomorphological agents and the shallow zone of \nhuman interaction \n \nLandscape is a complex concept that can include topography, landform, an object, a way of \nseeing the world and an inhabited space (Thomas 2001). The modern landscape represents \nthe surface expression of the underlying geology and the geological and anthropogenic \nprocesses that have transformed it. Landscape forming processes in Great Britain reflect a \ncombination of natural and anthropogenic systems that remove, transport and emplace \nsediment. This flow of materials and their inclusion in the subsurface geological record is one \nof the defining processes that characterises the landscape that we see around us today.  \nRapid population growth and the exploitation of the Earth\u2019s resources through \nurbanization, industrial and agricultural activity has led to humans becoming one of the most \nsignificant factors in the evolution of the Earth\u2019s landscape. As such, humans are a geological \nand geomorphological agent (Douglas & Lawson 2001; Hooke 2000; Mulder 1996; Sherlock \n1922; Wilkinson 2005). The impacts of anthropogenic transformation of the landscape \nthrough the transfer of quantities of rock and soil and the legacy it has left above and below \nthe ground as artificial ground may be used as an indicator of human activity with which to \ncharacterise the Anthropocene (Zalasiewicz et al. 2008; Zalasiewicz et al. 2010). \nWhile the ability of Homo sapiens to deliberately transform their environment is not \nunique in the animal kingdom, the magnitude of their impact (principally quantities of rock \nand soil transferred) is significant. Douglas & Lawson (2001) estimate that 972 M tonnes of \nearth material are deliberately moved by humans in Great Britain each year. This is \ncomparable with the capacity of annelid earthworms for example to process soil after \ningestion. Darwin, (1882) estimated that rates of soil processing in earthworms is as much as \n18.12 tonnes per acre per year (equivalent to an estimate of 991 M tonnes per year in Great \nBritain). \nIn Great Britain, the geomorphological and geological resources of the Earth have \nprovided the raw materials to support the expansion of human population. This includes the \nprovision of raw materials for shelter, energy, technology and the space for the disposal of \nwastes. Population growth, industrial expansion and urbanization are therefore intimately \nlinked to the direct impact of human activity on the landscape. Through history there have \nbeen pulses of intense landscape transformation taking place over short periods of time, \npunctuated by wars, economic depressions, famine and disease.  Evidence of this legacy has \nthe potential to be preserved as artificial ground either above or below the land surface.  \nPre-Industrial (broadly pre18th century) human activity associated with the transition \nof human society towards settlement, agriculture and localised industrial activity, evolved in \nGreat Britain from the Neolithic. Localised industrial and settlement activity included \nsubsurface Neolithic flint workings at Grimes Graves in Norfolk (Oakley 1972), quarries for \nstone axe factories in Langdale (NW England), Bronze Age copper mining on the Great \nOrme (Williams 1995) and Parys Mountain Anglesey, North Wales \n(Parys Underground Group 2010).  The onset of such activities resulted in the extraction, \ntransport and placement of rock and soil as artificial ground. Where people settled they also \ndeposited wastes so that middens form part of the anthropogenic strata comprising artificial \nground. These types of activities represented the first examples of humans contributing to the \nflow of geological material, and their role as geological and geomorphological agents in \nGreat Britain.  \nThe Iron Age saw the expansion of agricultural communities from their origins in the \nNeolithic, and an emerging culture working and smelting iron ore for weapons and \nimplements and constructing defensive hill forts. There are numerous mining and smelting \nsites such as those in the Forest of Dean and Northamptonshire in England that show \nevidence of landscape excavation and waste deposition (Haselgrove 1999). This activity \ncreated a need for charcoal to smelt the ore, leading to deforestation and the start of human \ninfluence on soil erosion.  \nRoman Britain saw an increase in mineral production for commodities including \ncopper, salt, coal and lead (Cooper 2002; Williams 1995). At the same time major building \nprojects using large amounts of quarried rock and burnt lime for concrete were undertaken as \nRoman populations became centralised into urban centres forming the foundations of future \ntowns and cities (Carver 1987). Such activity formed the first significant peak in the \nconstruction of the British built environment as towns and cities became the focus for \nmanufacturing, processing and trade. Subsequent phases of urban growth, construction and \ndemolition created an often thick \u2018urban deposit\u2019 including construction materials, \nfoundations and wastes in middens.   Urban growth rates fluctuated during the Anglo-Saxon, \nAnglo-Scandanavian and Medieval times, reaching a peak of new town construction in the \n13th century (Carver 1987), but mining continued for various metals and coal. During pre-\nIndustrial times, the relative scale of surface and subsurface impacts on the landscape may \nhave been significant, but the geographic extent was generally limited (Table 1).   \nWider geographic impacts were associated with intensive industrial activity, \nsettlement and urbanization, beginning in the late 18th century. Steffen and co-workers refer \nto this Era as the Industrial Era, Stage 1 of the Anthropocene, extending from ca. 1800 to \n1945, (Steffen et al. 2007). They recognise this time as a major phase of human influence on \nthe Earth System, significantly impacting the atmosphere through increased inputs of carbon \ndioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). However, physical transformation of the landscape \nthrough anthropogenic modification of the surface and subsurface of the Earth was also \nsignificant. Mining activities, urbanization and waste production resulted in large magnitude \nimpacts through increased volumes of earth material extracted, processed and deposited over \nincreasingly short periods of time compared to the pre18th century. This resulted in the large \nscale creation of artificial ground. The intensity of human activity, resource exploitation, \nmaterial consumption and landscape transformation varies though time, although the relative \nscale of impacts of that activity may be greater over shorter periods as populations expand \n(Figure 1). For example, coal production over the 350 years between 1500 and 1850 was \naround 2895 M tonnes (Sherlock 1922). Later, an equivalent amount of coal was produced in \nonly 23 years between 1860 and 1883. A coal mining peak in Great Britain between 1910 and \n1920 witnessed the production of the same volume in just 10 years (Sherlock 1922) and BGS \nMineral Statistics (British Geological Survey 2009). \nDeposition of geological materials derived from anthropogenic activity includes the \nemplacement of construction materials and the disposal of wastes. While deposition may \noccur close to the source of extraction, construction of the built environment often requires \nthe transport and net import of materials from a wide catchment. Major urban areas might \ntherefore be thought of as sinks for the deposition of geological materials that are either \ndirectly won from the ground or processed for re-use in construction (e.g. manufacture of \nconcrete and bricks). Anthropogenic activity including transport and use of construction \nmaterial, can therefore create an urban \u2018deposit\u2019 through inflow of material into the built \nenvironment (Douglas & Lawson 2001). Although centralised urban construction for \nresidential, commercial and industrial purposes focuses deposition of transferred material as \nartificial ground, its impact on rural environments is also significant. Infrastructure and \npeople in urban areas rely on resources transported in to them to sustain their growth. \nTransport of agricultural products and construction materials amongst others are required, \nalong with the road, rail and canal transport routes to carry them either from other parts of \nGreat Britain, or increasingly from international sources via ports and airports. Similarly, just \nas urban areas receive a net inflow of resources to support them, they are also net generators \nof waste materials. These materials may be buried in landfill sites or recycled and reused in \nconstruction where the \u2018sediment\u2019 is fit for that purpose. In all cases, the deposition of \nprocessed natural rock or soil raw materials results in the creation of artificial ground and \nconstitutes an anthropogenic feature of the Anthropocene.  \nThe political, socioeconomic and technological drivers that accelerated Britain\u2019s \nindustrial growth transformed the pattern of human habitation in the 18th and 19th centuries. \nPreviously, localised habitation and industry was generally restricted by the availability of \nenergy sources such as water and wind. Industrialisation resulted in a rapid transformation to \ncity living and centralized human occupation that began as far back as the Roman period. \nGlobally, in 1890 approximately 200 million people lived in cities compared to \napproximately 3 billion in 2001 (Steffen et al. 2007). In the UK alone, nearly 80% of people \nlived in an urban area in 2001 (Jeffries 2005).   \nIt is estimated that by the Domesday survey of 1086, lowland Britain was already \ndensely populated. Deforestation as a result of this meant that woodland comprised just 5% \nof the landscape of eastern England and 15% of England as a whole (Roberts 1998). The \nagricultural impacts of soil losses through processes such as tilling following tree clearances \nare significant. Some agricultural practices including tilling, mechanisation and increased \nfield size increase the vulnerability of soils to aeolian and hydrological erosion. The \nerodibility of soils depends largely on the lithological composition of the soil. It is estimated \nthat in the developed world, annual soil losses (denudation rate) from land classified as \ncropland are in the order of 1.0 kg\/m2 to 3.5 kg\/m2 from land classified as pasture (Hooke \n2000). In some parts of northeastern and eastern England, landmass areas classified as arable \nare susceptible to soil erosion rates in the region of 2.1 to 4.4 kg\/m2 through aeolian erosion \nalone (Morgan 1985).  \nGlobal anthropogenic denudation rates have exceeded those of natural, deep-time \ndenudation since the first millennium (Wilkinson 2005). Global, deep-time denudation rates \nhave fluctuated through the Phanerozoic, ranging from approximately 10 metres per million \nyear (m\/my) in the Middle Triassic to over 60 m\/my during the Pliocene with a mean average \nof 25 m\/my (Wilkinson 2005). When converted to geological timescales, denudation from \nanthropogenic cropland tillage alone is estimated to be in the order of 680 to 1400 m\/my in \ndeveloped and undeveloped countries respectively (Pimental et al. 1995; Pimental & \nSkidmore 1999). If the average denudation rate from agricultural activities is approximately \n643 m\/my (Wilkinson 2005), then the rate of agricultural anthropogenic denudation is \napproximately 28 times that of the deep-time mean denudation rate.  \nGlobally, Hooke (2000) estimates that in the year 2000, approximately 21 tonnes of \nrock and soil were moved per capita through combined agricultural and construction \nactivities. The physical transformation of the Earth through human induced processes such as \ntransfer of rock and soil or indirect erosion through tilling defines a shallow zone of human \ninteraction in the geosphere. The end products of anthropogenic processes (either a \nsedimentary deposit or an erosional feature) provide a physical marker within the \nAnthropocene. \n \n3. Anthropogenic processes \n \nEvidence of anthropogenic processes is recorded in the landscape and its subsurface \nas either a constructional or erosional features. Rock, soil, anthropogenic (processed or \nmanufactured) deposits or a mixture can be deposited and used in either a controlled \nengineered or an uncontrolled manner. Commonly, deposition results in a constructional \nlandform, an engineered structure or, where the landform is poorly defined on the surface, a \ndiffuse sedimentary deposit in the ground. Such deposits are referred to as made ground (see \nSection 4.2).  Equally, anthropogenic processes may be expressed as excavations, \nrepresenting natural material that has been removed through extraction. Such excavations are \nreferred to as worked ground. The material flux associated with anthropogenic processes of \nremoval, transport and deposition are similar to those geological processes of erosion, \ntransport and deposition.  \n \n3.1 Habitation and infrastructure \n \nThe remains from habitation buried in the ground are recorded by archaeologists with a well \ndefined historical chronology. However, for the past forty years or so, only the major features \nsuch as earthworks have been recorded by geologists as a part of artificial ground research. \nMany long-established cities have considerable thicknesses of artificial ground, caused by \nsuccessive phases of habitation building on the remains of earlier development. This can \nresult in made ground many metres high composed of building rubble and waste or, in large \ncities, widespread made ground that has a poorly defined margin and is very heterogeneous. \nThis complexity of artificial ground beneath cities began with the onset of urban \ncentralisation during the Roman period (Carver 1987) when buildings, transport \ninfrastructure, irrigation and municipal waste tips were constructed. Successive phases of \ndevelopment have added, or in some cases reused and recycled this artificial ground, leaving \na complex \u2018stratigraphy\u2019 of deposits including drains, middens, pits, cellars, foundations and \ntrenches amongst other features. For example, in industrial Manchester and Salford, NW \nEngland, this has resulted in up to 10 m of artificial ground. In the heritage city of York, NE \nEngland, equivalent deposits reflecting over 2000 years of occupation, are up to 8 m thick \n(Holden et al. 2009). \nFrom an early age, the infrastructure that supports settlement and habitation included \nthe construction of irrigation systems followed by canals, roads, railways and tunnels for \ntransport. These have been excavated beneath the land surface, cut into the land or banked \nupon the natural ground surface, forming worked and made ground. From the Industrial \nRevolution onwards the scale of these activities has increased and the volumes of material \nnow moved during construction are considerable. For example, the Channel Tunnel, linking \nGreat Britain and mainland Europe, produced 20 M tonnes of rock spoil, which was placed at \nthe foot of Shakespeare Cliff, forming 40 ha (hectares) of new land at Samphire Hoe in Kent, \nSE England (Douglas & Lawson 2001). The CrossRail railway scheme linking east and west \nLondon produced 5 M tonnes of material from the rail link excavations which was shipped \ndown river to form 600 ha of made ground at Wallasea Island, Essex (CrossRail 2010). \nConstruction of an extension of the M6 motorway in the English Midlands, resulted in the \nmovement of approximately 15 M tonnes of material through excavation and embankment \nconstruction (The Motorway Archive 2010).  \nCurrently the amount of material moved for road and infrastructure construction in \nGreat Britain is probably about 155 M tonnes a year based on year 2000 figures (Douglas & \nLawson 2001). Historical made ground is most likely to be unengineered tipped fill. \nHowever, modern deposits for road and infrastructure construction are compacted and \nengineered for strength and performance; the majority of this built up material is of local or \nmoderately local origin, though in coastal areas it may have been imported, sometimes as \nship ballast from abroad. The volume of material moved for the construction of canals, \nrailways, roads, motorways, tunnels and for building construction is significant. In 1922 \nSherlock estimated the volume of material moved for the construction of canals, railways, \ntunnels, roads and building construction as 4507 M cubic yards or about 3.5 km3 (Sherlock \n1922). Since then, significant urban expansion and motorway construction has taken place, \nmoving approximately 1500 M tonnes in the last 10 years and possibly 11 000 M tonnes \nsince 1922, a volume of around 8 or 9 km3.  \n \n3.2 Natural resource exploitation \n \nThe human need for minerals, energy and building materials has resulted in \nwidespread mining and quarrying. The relative importance of cultural, socio-economic, \npolitical and environmental factors as drivers for the growth of populations and their use of \nnatural resources changes through time. Mineral veins at the surface have been worked to \nleave opencast excavations in the landscape and spoil heaps as made ground. Quarrying, first \nfor building stone, then later for brick clay, aggregate and cement manufacture, has left large-\nscale areas of worked ground. Quarries for igneous and metamorphic rocks are visible in \nareas such as North Wales, the Lake District and the Midland Valley of Scotland. Technology \nsuch as  hushing and ground sluicing, to locate mineral veins, is first seen in the Roman \nperiod, harnessing natural forces to aid production. To deliver the large quantities of water \nrequired to the mine head, large industrial aqueducts and hushing tanks were constructed. \nThis system was used at the Roman gold mine Dolaucothi in southern Wales where \nwidespread archaeological evidence for these processes has been recorded (Wilson 2002). \nOpencast mineral working, especially for coal and ironstone, has moved considerable \nvolumes of overburden. This may reach 18 or 20 times the volume of the mineral extracted. \nIn some areas of Great Britain, where the coal sequences come to surface, up to 20% of the \nland has been turned over in this manner. Some of these workings reach down to depths of 80 \nor more metres and the deepest, the former Westfield site in Scotland, to 215 metres \n(Durham Mining Museum 2010).  \nDeeper working has resulted in collapses and open stopes creating subsidence that \nlowers the natural ground surface. This subsidence is effectively \u2018hidden\u2019 artificial ground.  \nUnderground coal workings were initially undertaken using pillar and stall extraction \ntechniques leaving earlier random and then later regular patterns of galleries with supporting \npillars. Where underground workings have been infilled for ground stabilisation, or where \nequipment and infrastructure have been left underground, artificial ground is created. \nIndustrial impacts on the shallow subsurface are widespread and arise not only from the \nphysical infrastructure associated with the mining industry but also from the chemical and \nbiological processes which underpin these activities. The examination of 9 m deep alluvial \ndeposits on the banks of the Ouse at North Street, York revealed the presence of lead \ncontamination arising from relatively remote Yorkshire Dales mining activity between the \n9th and 13th centuries AD. Contamination was sourced from mining and smelting activities \nand transported contaminants by the River Ouse. There were also local effects from \nconsumption, including use, wear and disposal (Hudson-Edwards 1999). \nUsing BGS figures for extraction since 1850, the total UK mined (onshore and \nundersea) and opencast coal is around 24 700 M tonnes or a volume of around 19.5 km3 of \nextraction.  The waste from this adds another 6800 M tonnes with a solid volume of around \n3.1 km3 and a bulked up volume of around 5 km3. UK production of iron ore from 1850 to \n1973 (Figure 1) was about 1582 M tonnes. A bulk density of 2.59 g\/cc suggests an extracted \nvolume of about 0.6 km3 plus 1.8 km3 of overburden. A significant amount of the ore volume \nhas been turned into furnace slag and waste tips. These are just a few indicators of the \nmagnitude of impact and landscape modification by humans creating artificial ground and \nsubsidence. Applying similar calculations to all of the major commodities listed in the BGS \nmineral statistics for the UK gives a total volume of around 38.5 km3 of material (mineral, \noverburden and waste) moved by humans for mineral extraction since 1850. This is \nequivalent to moving more than four times the volume of Ben Nevis in the past 160 years. \nFrom early in the 20th century longwall mining of coal became the standard extraction \ntechnique made possible by technology allowing roof support and ventilation (Bell 2000). In \nthe longwall workings, panels of coal were extracted between parallel tunnels dug out from a \nservice or haulage tunnel. This technique left less of the resource underground, but caused \nlargely predictable subsidence at the surface. The mechanised extraction also generated more \nwaste than manual digging.  \nSome minerals such as salt are soluble and were originally gathered from natural \nbrine springs. With industrialisation, pumping of the wild brine allowed large amounts of \nproduction. It also caused severe subsidence in places such as Northwich and Droitwich in \ncentral England (Cooper 2002). The brine run subsidence features can run for 10 km or so \nfrom the salt works pumping them. Many square kilometres of the Cheshire salt area, NW \nEngland, are affected by this sort of subsidence and similar features; brine extraction and \nsubsidence also affects land near Preesall (Lancashire, NW England) and Teesside (NE \nEngland). Such features are now integral parts of the landscape. For example, lakes or \n\u2018meres\u2019 now occupy salt subsidence features in Cheshire. \nSimilarly, the areas and volumes of subsided land caused by coal mining are \nconsiderable. In Great Britain it is not uncommon for between one and three metres of \nsubsidence to have occurred due to mining operations. Toll Bar near Doncaster, NE England \nis an example of this; a comparison of benchmarks here shows up to 3.1 m of subsidence \nbetween 1948 and 2007. Elsewhere up to 13 m of subsidence has occurred at Silverdale near \nWigan, NW England (D Wilshaw pers comm). From mining literature (Bell et al. 2000; NCB \n1975) it is likely that there is a range of values from 50%-90% of the mined volume \nmanifesting itself as surface subsidence. BGS mineral figures for deep coal mining since \n1900 (assumed to be mainly longwall mining) indicates 18 151 M tonnes of coal extraction. \nWith a density of 1.26 g\/cc (DTI 2004) and a waste extraction of 35% this equates with a \nsurface subsidence volume of between 9.7 and 19.4 km3 depending on what percentage of \nsubsidence manifests itself at the surface. It must be noted that a proportion of this subsidence \nwill be under the sea.  \n \n3.3 Natural resource processing and wastes \n \nDeep coal mining generates about 35% waste which is deposited as spoil heaps that form \namongst the most significant anthropogenic landforms in Great Britain. Information from \nOrdnance Survey maps shows some spoil heaps covering between half and one square \nkilometre (e.g. Gasgoinge Wood Mine, NE England), containing millions of tonnes of waste. \nMost mineral processing generates waste and some such as iron smelting and oil shale \nprocessing generate very large volumes compared with the end product. Artificial ground \ncomprising furnace slag covers large areas around many British towns and cities. The form of \nthese waste heaps varies from small, randomly tipped heaps near historical mines and \nsmelters through more organised tips built out from mine or works railways or conveyors. \nModern tips can extend over many hundreds of hectares, can be tens of metres high and, \nunlike their earlier counterparts, can be heavily engineered for stability. In coastal areas much \nof the waste material has been used for land reclamation (e.g. Teesside, NE England and Port \nTalbot, South Wales), where reclaimed land several kilometres across has been built up by \nfurnace wastes and other spoil (Waters et al. 2005). The tonnages and volumes of waste \nproducts produced in the UK each year are very large, but some of the materials can be re-\nused, often being re-deposited in the urban environment. \nDomestic and industrial waste tips are a type of artificial ground and commonly \noccupy previously excavated holes in the ground or sit upon the ground if there are no \nconvenient workings. For example, much of Ferrybridge Power Station\u2019s fly ash, in NE \nEngland is deposited in settling ponds constructed in the former sand and gravel pits of the \nAire Valley, North Yorkshire.  Old waste tips commonly fill quarries and small river valleys \nand were completely uncontrolled in their content (Dearman et al. 1977). Modern waste \ndisposal sites by comparison are licensed and have facilities for the interception and removal \nof gas and leachate. In 1995, municipal and household waste was 25.89 M tonnes and 88.6% \nof this went to landfill (22.9 M tonnes) with only 6.4% being recycled (Douglas & Lawson \n2001). By 2005\/6 there were 35.1 M tonnes of municipal waste, 64% (22.5M tonnes) went to \nlandfill, 8% was incinerated and 27% was recycled (DEFRA 2010b).  Demolition waste is \nalso being recycled and now approximately half (about 42 M tonnes in 2005) is reused \n(2010a). Prior to about 2000, most went into landfill sites.  The volumes of waste deposited \nas artificial ground is difficult to determine due to the differing ways in which it has been \nclassified. However, DEFRA figures show that from 1988-2008 the total amount of landfill \nmaterial was about 800 M tonnes, equivalent to about 0.8 km3 of material in ten years.  \n \n4. Anthropogenic activity in the geological record: artificial ground classification \nand characterisation \n \n4.1 Natural and Anthropogenic landscape evolution \n \nHuman and natural processes rarely operate in temporal or spatial isolation. Anthropogenic \nprocesses contribute to the evolution of the landscape through the production of artificial \nground, including archaeological remains. This includes areas where human activity has \nmodified the landscape through removal or placement of rock, soil and waste material. The \ntype of excavation and composition of anthropogenic material reflects the process that \nemplaced it and its origin. Its composition can be extremely variable both laterally and \nvertically, representing rapid land use change in one locality. Stratigraphically, artificial \nground can be interpreted as sedimentary deposits or excavations representing the human \ngeological record during the Anthropocene.  \n \n4.2 Artificial Ground Classification \n \nIt was not until the 1960s that artificial ground was shown on geological maps published by \nthe BGS (British Geological Survey 1978) , and not until the 1990s that artificial ground \nmapping became a routine aspect of geological surveying (British Geological Survey 1995; \nMcMillan & Powell 1999). Artificial ground is recognised as a potential ground hazard due \nto the variability of its composition, ground stability (including landslides)  and its \nassociation with potentially contaminative land uses (Bishop 1973; Rosenbaum 2003). \nHowever, it also represents the \u2018geological\u2019 evidence for historical anthropogenic activity and \nforms part of the shallow zone of human interaction in the subsurface. Where socioeconomic \nconditions are suitable, some types of artificial ground may be a resource (former \nmetalliferous waste tips for example). Artificial ground may also enhance ecosystems and the \nservices they provide, for example through the creation of ecological habitats in areas of \nhistorical mineral extraction. \nArtificial ground characterisation requires the identification of a diagnostic landform \n(morphology) and where possible its physical, sedimentological and lithological \n(compositional) characteristics (Rosenbaum et al. 2003). In general, a combination of these \ncharacteristics is required to interpret the genesis of artificial ground, though they may not \nalways be available. For example, a landform may be well defined at the surface but its \nsubsurface properties and thickness may be unknown. Conversely, subsurface data from \nboreholes and excavations may be available, but there may be no surface landform associated \nwith it (Rosenbaum et al. 2003). Modern 1:10 000 and 1:50 000 scale British geological maps \nuse a 5-fold classification scheme in their depiction of artificial ground (Table 2 and Figure \n2). This artificial ground classification is based on a morpho-stratigraphic approach with an \nemphasis on the landform and the anthropogenic process that created it. In this scheme, Made \nGround includes engineered fill.  Landforms are identified through a combination of \nobservation and the appraisal of spatial data sources, including aerial photographs, \ntopographical maps, digital elevation models and ground investigation data (Figure 3). The \ncombined use of recent spatial data and multiple generations of legacy data, allows historical \nland-use change to be considered and the most appropriate class of artificial ground to be \nchosen. However, with the exception of infilled ground, the scheme does not account for \ndifferent phases of anthropogenic activity that may be represented at any one location.  \nIn response to a continuing increase in the recognition of artificial ground as a key \ncomponent of the human zone of interaction (Rosenbaum 2003; Walton & Lee 2001), an \nenhanced classification scheme for artificial ground in 2D and 3D has been devised (Ford et \nal. 2006; Price et al. 2004). This extensible scheme is structured as a three-tier hierarchy, \nusing Class, Type and Unit to describe in progressively more detail the origin and landform \nof the deposit or excavation (Figure 4). Where multiple sources or generations of artificial \nground exist, the temporal and aerial extent from each source may be recorded to capture the \ndevelopment of the artificial ground as a factor in anthropogenic landscape evolution (Figure \n5). Thematic surveys, including a detailed study of central Liverpool, have applied the \nenhanced scheme to develop an integrated anthropogenic and natural landscape evolution \nmodel (Figure 6 and Table 3). The scheme is designed to interface with complementary \nschemes including the National Land Use Database that contains information on previously \ndeveloped land in England (Harrison 2006). Parallel schemes for the classification of urban \nsoils offer the potential for further integration and the development of a comprehensive \nreference framework for urban environmental research (Hollis 1991). The enhanced artificial \nground classification scheme provides a basis for the quantification of anthropogenic activity \nwithin the Anthropocene. \n \n4.3 Artificial Ground Distribution \n \nThe gross distribution of mapped artificial ground in Great Britain is a function of the \ndate when individual areas (1:50 000 scale geological map sheets) were last surveyed. \n(Figure 7). Although geological data exists for almost every sheet, only those surveyed since \nthe 1960s (approximately two thirds of Great Britain) show any significant artificial ground. \nBased on an assessment of available geological map data, approximately 1.4% of mainland \nBritain is covered by artificial ground (Table 4). \nThe extent of mapped artificial ground is greatest in urban conurbations where the \nlandscape has been affected by frequent phases of human activity.  For example, artificial \nground covers almost 18% of the land in Manchester including colliery spoil, infilled brick \nand gravel pits, industrial waste and infilled river valleys (Burke et al. 2009). Rural areas, \ncommonly the source of much of the material destined for accumulation in urban and \nindustrial conurbations, show less than 1% artificial ground coverage. For example, artificial \nground in Saxmundham in rural Suffolk, represents only 0.7% of the sample area, comprising \ninfrastructure, coastal defences and mineral extraction sites that have provided aggregates for \nsurrounding urban areas. Composite areas such as the Midland Valley of Scotland and the \nwider London area combine both the source and accumulation sites for artificial deposits and \nshow an average coverage of approximately 7.2% by area.  \nThe figures presented here for the extent of artificial ground are an underestimate of \ntheir probable total coverage. The limitations of conventional geological surveying and map \nproduction (scale restrictions and cartographic generalisation) result in an under-\nrepresentation of artificial ground. Similarly, rapid land use change, especially in urban areas \nmeans that recent artificial ground may be unrecorded.  \nRecent advances in 3D geological modelling of the shallow subsurface has enabled \nthe development of the 3D characterisation and classification of artificial ground. 3D \ngeological modelling methodologies using GSI3D\u2122 software (Kessler et al. 2009) have been \napplied to artificial ground to quantify and visualise anthropogenic landscape evolution in \nManchester and Liverpool, NW England (Price et al. 2010). Coverage of 3D geological \nmodels in Great Britain is increasing but is not yet as extensive as 2D geological maps. \nExtending the 2D classification into 3D is an essential tool in characterising the legacy of \nanthropogenic impacts including concealed anthropogenic events in the subsurface. 3D \ngeological models capture the vertical sequence and volume of individual deposits and \nexcavations, providing a 3D framework for attribution with age and composition information. \nThis is especially important in areas with specific historic activities that may be obscured \nbeneath younger made ground or natural deposits. Figure 8 shows the thickness of made \nground resulting from industrial land use change over approximately 160 years in Trafford \nPark, Salford in NW England. This is derived from a 3D geological model based on the \ninterpretation of approximately 3600 boreholes for the area shown. The composition and \nthickness of made ground in this area is recorded in boreholes and this data is used to \nconstrain the geological models. In Figure 8, made ground infilling the former course of the \nRiver Irwell and deposited adjacent to the Manchester Ship Canal is up to 10 m thick and \ncomprises colliery spoil, furnace waste and ash probably deposited during construction of the \ncanal in between 1887 and 1894.  \nArtificial ground that is formed as a result of changing land use through time is \ncommonly contaminated and is therefore a potential source of pollution. The land use history \nof a site or the area in which it lies strongly influences not only the type of artificial ground, \nbut also its chemical properties. In some cases the anthropogenic chemical signatures of \nartificial ground, or the sediment into which the pollution may migrate, can be used as a \nmarker for the source of contamination and its absolute age. Sediments recovered in the \nMersey Estuary, NW England show distinct contamination with elevated concentrations of \npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and Mercury \n(Vane et al. 2007; Vane et al. 2009). These signatures, and their variation with depth, are \ninterpreted to relate to the industrial development of the Mersey region where elevated \nmercury concentrations are associated with the expansion of the chemicals industry on the \nbanks of the estuary in the mid 19th century. It is possible to relate these chemical signatures \nto the timing of the onset of industrial processes and therefore provide an indicative age of \nthe estuarine sediments and the related artificial ground source onshore. In other cases, \nmethods of relative dating of artificial ground can be derived from historical map and written \ndata sources.  Dearman (1977) illustrated the relative anthropogenic history of infilling and \nculverting in part of the catchment of the rivers Tyne and Wear, NE England. Relative dating \nand recognition of anthropogenic markers in the anthropogenic stratigraphical record has also \nbeen achieved using distinctive objects in the subsurface. Ager, (1993) highlights one \napproach during the investigation of old mining camps in the USA, using the changing shape \nof beer cans as an \u2018evolutionary\u2019 marker. Ager also refers to a French classification system of \nanthropogenic deposits using such markers into an Upper dustbinian\/trascanian (with plastic) \nand a Lower dustbinain\/trascanian (without plastic). \nThe conventional BGS approach to mapping and 3D modelling of artificial ground \ndoes not explicitly describe its composition or attribute an age. However, lithological \ncomposition is an important factor in the characterisation of human geological signature in \nthe Anthropocene. The degree of lateral and vertical heterogeneity in artificial deposits in the \nsubsurface is assumed to be high. However, the composition of made ground and engineered \nfill can be characterised based on its texture, grain size and lithological composition (whether \nreworked rock or soil, or processed anthropogenic sediments). Both the grain-size and \ncomposition of the material can be recorded. Schemes such as British Standards for the \ndescription of soils and rocks can be used to describe anthropogenic material \n(British Standards Institution 1999). For material deposited as waste, a classification based on \nthat described in the European Waste Catalogue might be applied to compliment a \ndescription of the sediment (Environment Agency 2005).  \nThe 2D and 3D classification and characterisation of artificial ground could be further \nenhanced by applying an attribute that describes the relative or absolute age of artificial \nground to derive the rates of anthropogenically driven land use change. \n \n5. Preservation potential of anthropogenic artificial ground \n \nThe classification and characterisation of artificial ground provides a means to quantify the \nmagnitude of anthropogenic activity. However, in geological time, this is dependent on its \nsubsurface preservation. The natural geological record represents a complex legacy of \nprocesses. At one extreme, processes of accumulation result in the localised building of the \nrock record and the preservation of evidence of geological events and environments (e.g. \nsediments and fossils). At the other extreme, processes of erosion result in the removal and \nreworking of existing deposits and the introduction of time gaps (discontinuities) in the rock \nrecord. The result is an incomplete and often biased perspective on the geological history of \nan area. Processes responsible for artificial ground operate in a similar fashion: human \nactivity includes the accumulation of material (typically, but not exclusively in urban \nenvironments) and the widespread removal of both natural and existing artificial deposits. \nThese processes operate alongside their natural equivalents. The preservation of artificial \nground in the geological record is contingent on its ability to survive the erosive and \ntransformative effects of both natural and human processes in terrestrial environments.  \nArtificial ground is predisposed for destruction. The most immediate threat to its \npreservation is that of changing land use in response to social and economic drivers including \nthe regeneration of existing urban and industrial development and the exploitation of material \npreviously classified as waste (e.g. reworking abandoned mine waste tips to exploit historic \n\u201cwaste\u201d deposits  (Collins & Miller 1979; Scott et al. 2005) and landfill mining (van der Zee \net al. 2004). In the longer term, most artificial ground will succumb to natural processes as \nerosion seeks to re-establish equilibrium that has been exceeded by the creation of artificial \nground. Once buried, anthropogenic material in the ground is subject to chemical \ndegradation. For organic deposits, hydrogeological conditions surrounding the material and \nchanges in those conditions related to land use and environmental change may determine \ntheir susceptibility to degradation (Holden et al. 2009). Fluctuations in water level control the \nredox potential of the subsurface environment, promoting the formation of corrosive \nchemical species. Studies in the heritage city of York, UK have identified up to 8 m of \nwaterlogged organic, anthropogenic deposits beneath the city. Dewatering and urban \ndevelopment have degraded the buried deposits in-situ, reducing their preservation potential. \nHowever, it should be noted that when appropriate conditions prevail, the geological \nrecord has the potential to capture traces of fleeting events (Mazin et al. 2009; Shul'ga 2004) \nand remarkably delicate lifeforms (von Bitter et al. 2007; Wilkinson et al. 2010). Traces of \nanthropogenic activity dated to 3649 \u00b1 109 BP comprising footprints and trackway \ninfrastructure have been preserved on the coast of NW England (Gonzalez & Cowell 2004) \nfor example. The same may apply to the preservation of made ground and \u201chabitation traces\u201d \nsuch as buildings, landfill sites and engineered structures (Zalasiewicz 2008).  \nSpecific locales, such as river valleys, have always held an attraction for the \nsettlement of human communities. Analysis of the British fluvial stratigraphic record \nindicates a wider variety of channel types and styles in the past than found today, following \nthe widespread and large scale land drainage and channelization that accompanied the \nIndustrial Revolution (Howard & Macklin 1999). Low energy river systems are accretional in \nnature and coupled with high water tables from c. 5000 to 4000BP and 2500BP which have \ninfluenced catchment hydrology, they have increased the likelihood of cultural deposit \npreservation (Howard & Macklin 1999). Conversely, in some areas, construction and \ndevelopment in river valleys has led to drainage of valley floors, which has resulted in the \nlowering of water tables and the oxidation and subsequent degradation of archaeological \ndeposits (Howard & Macklin 1999). Whilst the accumulation of fine- grained sediments can \nimprove the chances of preservation, it can also mask the deposits so that they cannot be \ndetected by traditional prospection techniques.  River valley environments can only be \neffectively studied by a multidisciplinary approach which seeks to integrate archaeological \nand geomorphological evidence (Howard & Macklin 1999). \nAlthough brick, concrete, steel, plastic and glass represent significant components of \nartificial deposits, their relative propensity for preservation varies considerably. A \ncomprehensive account of the specific mechanisms affecting preservation potential is beyond \nthe scope of this paper. In general however, the longer-term preservation potential for \nmaterial deposited in terrestrial environments is far lower than that for marine environments. \nThis presents a particular challenge for the preservation of artificial ground which is \npreferentially developed on land. Natural terrestrial processes including the weathering \neffects of wind and ice and the erosive potential of relatively high-energy fluvial systems \nconspire to level the land surface (conveying material to the marine environment). The \nproportion of marine strata (including coastal delta deposits) in the 3 billion year old bedrock \ngeological record in Great Britain is almost 3 times that for strata deposited in a terrestrial \nenvironment (Great Britain\u2019s bedrock geology comprises approximately 57% marine deposits \nand 20% terrestrial deposits with the balance of 23% represented by igneous or metamorphic \nstrata).  \nIt is therefore likely that artificial ground associated with coastal plain cities may have \nthe greatest potential for preservation (Zalasiewicz 2008). In a scenario of rising sea-level, \nthe process of preservation may begin with abandonment (and the cessation of potentially \ndestructive human processes) followed by inundation (and the abeyance of terrestrial \nweathering) and the eventual concealment beneath natural marine deposits, offset by the \nprocess of coastal erosion. With increased depth of burial, the effects of heat and pressure \nmay commit the artificial ground to the sedimentary cycle and bedrock record.  \nAn appropriate timeframe is essential when considering the preservation potential of \nanthropogenic activity, from predicting its preservation in the context of geological time (and \nthe concept of the Anthropocene), to understanding the nature of evidence for early human \nactivity or potential contamination associated with recent made ground. The anticipated \nresponse of anthropogenic deposits and landforms to each of these time \u201cscales\u201d is an \nessential factor in understanding the legacy of human activity on the landscape.  \n \n6. Conclusions \n \nHumans are a major factor in transforming the landscape, including the subsurface, through \nthe deliberate shift of rock and soil, production of waste and enhanced denudation from \nagricultural activity. The physical transformation of the landscape correlates with increased \npopulation growth and the development of socioeconomic, political, technological and \ncultural drivers for landscape exploitation to meet their needs. The physical transformation \ncan be measured in terms of its magnitude of impact (quantity of material moved) and its rate \n(the time over which the material movement occurred). Humans as geological and \ngeomorphological agents are a major factor in British landscape evolution within the \nAnthropocene.  \nRapid and large scale anthropogenic activity is commonly associated with the \nIndustrial Revolution.  The sedimentological consequences of this are coincident with \natmospheric release of gases such as methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to the \natmosphere. As such, the sedimentological response and its record in the subsurface can be \nconsidered a marker defining the Anthropocene and is broadly coincident with the Industrial \nAge of the Anthropocene proposed by (Steffen et al. 2007).The impacts of much earlier \nhuman activity as a landscape transforming agent in the Anthropocene should not be \ndiscounted however. \nAnthropogenically driven landscape changes were already in place before the \nIndustrial Revolution. The timing of the onset of humans as geological and geomorphological \nagents in Great Britain can be considered as that time in which earth moving activities began. \nThe transformation from hunter gatherer to farming communities with small scale subsurface \nexploitation for flint occurred at Grimes Graves during the Neolithic and is one example of \nearly human activity as a landscape transforming process through creation of artificial \nground. The onset of Bronze Age resource exploitation, metal processing and agricultural \nactivity on a larger geographic scale than previously seen represented a further transformation \ntowards humans becoming significant factors in landscape evolution and a defining factor in \nthe Anthropocene.  \nAs with geological boundaries, the timing of onset of major anthropogenic activity is \nlikely to have been different across different areas in Great Britain. The nature of this \ndifference is likely to be even greater on a global scale. Therefore the timing of significant \nanthropogenic activity as a geological and geomorphological process and its sedimentological \nimpact is likely to be diachronous over tens, hundreds or even thousands of years when the \ndeveloped and developing worlds are considered. The widespread exploitation of subsurface \nminerals, especially coal and iron in Great Britain, led to rapid transformation of the \nlandscape as materials were excavated and waste deposited. Waste disposal, and large scale \nurbanization, may represent the most significant visible record of widespread human activity \nin Great Britain. This record may also be preserved in the subsurface geological record.  \nFuture uses of the subsurface such as repositories for disposal of radioactive wastes may also \nprovide a mechanism for the preservation of underground artificial ground. \nThe characterisation of the drivers for anthropogenic processes, land use change and \nthe resulting artificial ground is essential to quantify the impacts of historical and current \nanthropogenic activity on the geosphere. The interaction of people and the shallow \nsubsurface creates a shallow zone of human interaction where natural and anthropogenic \nprocesses take place. The sustainable management of this zone and the ecosystem services to \nsocieties that it provides is critical if it is to function effectively in response to future \nenvironmental change. Its resilience to environmental change, including changes in land use, \nclimate and population growth will determine its nature and properties within the \nAnthropocene Epoch. \n7.
