The referees for this article made almost identical\ncomments: it fits within the criteria set out in the guidelines for authors, it is worth\npublishing for both its new perspectives and its review of current thinking, and it cannot\nbe cut down to the normal word limit without losing most of the value of what it says.\nGrabinger's bibliography alone will, I hope, prove a valuable research resource in its own\nright.\nThe piece by C. K. Ramaiah and colleagues presents the results of some interesting\nexperiments concerned with student skills in handling new technology; they thus\ntangentially encompass learning theory. Oleg Pilipenko and Helena Komissarova do so\nmore directly in dealing with the ways in which learners interact with computers. Gervase\nPhillips, who proposes that the distinction between the activities of History students and\nprogrammers is artificial, touches on the same theme. Anne Groat and Tim Musson deal\nwith the fascinating question of learning styles. And the report by Naidu and colleagues,\non ways of improving instructional effectiveness with computer-mediated communica-\ntion, naturally involves learning theory. Even in the book reviews in this issue, there is a\nbias towards educational theories and how we can best put them into practice.\nThese facts are the result of two interlinked things. The first is that while theorizing about\neducation is hardly new, we are seeing more and more of it in the area of educational\ntechnology - so much so that at ALT-C '95, I heard more than once the view expressed\nthat we ought to be getting on with the practice of education and leaving the theory to\nthose who live in the clouds. What a relief, I was told by one delegate, to come to a\nconference where the vast majority of presentations were concerned with people's actual\n2\nALT-J Volume 3 Number 2\nexperiences as practitioners, as opposed to airy-fairy, holier-than-thou pronouncements,\nin jargon-ridden and often impenetrable language, about this or that obscure theory. I\nquote: 'Let them actually produce something and try it out in the real world of the\ntutorial room or computer lab; only then will they be worth listening to - and we might\nthen also understand what they're talking about.' And aimed straight at me by another\ndelegate: 'ALT-J should be publishing more about what ALT members have actually done,\nand are actually doing'.\nWell, the second thing is that referees for ALT-J, following the guidelines sent to them,\ntend to reject papers which merely describe what people have done, are doing or are\nintending to do, unless such papers say something really new - and, paradoxically,\ngenuine innovation is actually quite rare in our highly innovative field. Most purely\ndescriptive papers report the implementation of a piece of software, and perhaps some\nstudent reactions to it, with no worthwhile analysis or independent judgement of it.\nStudents may say they like a piece of CAL software, but that is not the same as saying\nthat they have learned much from it, or have learned in some better way from it, or have\nlearned anything from it that they could not have learned by some other less expensive\nmeans (you can buy a lot of books with the amount spent on developing some CD-\nROMs). Assessment of the value of CAL must be based on comparisons with\nalternatives. In three years as Editor of this journal, I can count on the fingers of one\nhand the number of papers I have received which make even an indirect attempt at such\ncomparisons using proper research methods (as opposed to 'feelings', or vague and\nsometimes dubious anecdotal evidence). Of course, for certain aspects of CAL, it is hardly\nnecessary to prove the case. Distance learning is one example. Here, the balances between\nthe costs and the benefits of sending digital data down telephone lines instead of having\nface-to-face contact are often fairly clear, and in any case (as with the Open University)\nusually carefully assessed, before, during and after implementation. Furthermore, the\njustification for using communications technology, whatever the cost, is often self-\nevident; indeed (as at the Open University), such technology is sometimes indispensable.\nBut there are other areas where one wonders if the team of people who have written a\npiece of CAL software have not started from the assumption that CAL is a Good Thing\n(or, worse, have received funding and to Hell with whether it is or is not), never\nquestioning its value when set against its costs except for the occasional nod in the\ndirection of real-worldliness - costs not just of development, but also costs to an\ninstitution persuaded to spend large amounts of money on equipment to deliver the\nsoftware, and an army of technicians to keep it all up and running. Let me emphasize that\nI am not arguing the case against CAL. I am hardly likely to do that, given my belief in its\nhuge potential in so many aspects of university activity. I am arguing for a level of self-\nassessment on the part of those involved in it. A paper which does no more than describe\nwhat a development team has done, with no real analysis, nor showing any evidence of\nrigorous methodology in its judgements (if they are there at all) does not advance our\ncause. If we do not look critically at what we do, if we do not present incontrovertible\nevidence of the benefits of CAL set against its cost (and, if necessary, be honest about its\nfailures), others who know little about the subject will eventually take a cool look at what\nwe are doing and conclude that we do not know either.\nThus, we have an issue of ALT-J which is biased towards learning theory, and which, I\n3\nGabriel Jacobs Editorial\nthink, reflects the view that the use of educational technology is an intellectual challenge\nas well as a practical means of teaching and learning. Rightly so. We are academics. We\nshould doubt all claims of success, all evidence which has not been subject to critical\nscrutiny. Nearly all the papers which the referees rejected for this issue failed to take a\nself-critical look at what they described (described rather than analysed). Where were the\ncontrol groups of students who had learned the same material delivered by some means\nother than a computer (difficult, I know, but not impossible)? Where was the testing of a\ntheory? Where were the cost-benefit analyses? Where was the research methodology?\nWhere were the papers which discussed why students disliked an implementation? Do all\nCAL implementations result in favourable student reaction?\nSo it is not by chance after all that this issue contains so much theory, even if much of it is\ninextricably linked with practice. Theory inevitably involves intellectual activity, and\nautomatically attracts analysis, critical assessment, and detached evaluation of evidence.\nThe referees have reacted accordingly.\nGabriel Jacobs\n4\n"}
