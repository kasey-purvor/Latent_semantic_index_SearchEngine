Gibson  Cultural Trends \nCorresponding author: L. Gibson. Email: lg80@le.ac.uk \n \nRecently the cultural policy, museum and heritage studies literatures have contained a \ngreat deal of discussion of the so called \u201einstrumentalisation\u201f of cultural institutions and \nprogrammes which is described as emerging over the last thirty or so years. This \nperception of culture\u201fs co called \u201einstrumentalisation\u201f seems to be widespread and is \nprimarily perceived as a \u201ethreat\u201f (e.g. Belfiore, 2002; Selwood, 2002; Holden 2006 & \n2004). Even accounts which aim to focus on the specifics of policy development and \noperation have posited and criticised the recent development of an \u201einstrumentality\u201f in \ncultural policy (Gray, 2007 and 2000). However, in these deconstructions, primarily \naimed at the poor impact studies and overblown claims made for the arts and culture, \nthere is little to guide us towards a way of thinking about cultural policy which is \nconstructive. That is, an analysis which while critical also takes seriously the practical \nchallenges for cultural management and policy. One of the problem\u201fs with this open \nseason attack on, so called, \u201einstrumentalisation\u201f is that in the absence of analyses which \nseek to follow up these deconstructions with alternative proposals for ways of thinking \nabout culture and its administration the field is left open for a return to the kinds of elite, \nexclusionary policies which have characterised cultural administration in the past, and in \nmany cases still does. As Mark O\u201fNeill, Head of Museums and Galleries for Glasgow \nCity Council, concludes in his critique of John Holden\u201fs Capturing Cultural Value  \nTargets and measurements can be refined, but what can be done about the \nprofound sense amongst\u2026 groups of entitlement\u2013 entitlement to having their \ncultural recreations funded without being troubled by the values of a wider \nsociety based on democracy, accountability, equity and fairness? (2005, 124). \n \nAn illustration will serve to set the scene and develop my point further. The \ncurrent terms of the debate within cultural policy can be summarised by quoting from \nElenora Belfiore\u201fs much cited article \u201eArt as a means of alleviating social exclusion: \nDoes it really work? A critique of instrumental cultural policies and social impact studies \nin the UK\u201f (2002). The introductory sentence of one of the concluding paragraphs states  \nThis study is not aimed at advocating a model of public support for the arts based \non the \u201eart for art\u201fs sake\u201f rationale\u2026 However, the aim of this paper is to show \nhow instrumental cultural policies are not sustainable in the long term (2002, \n104).  \n3 \nL. Gibson  Cultural Trends \nCorresponding author: L. Gibson. Email: lg80@le.ac.uk \n \nBelfiore tells us that instead we should think of culture in the following terms \u201eCulture is \nnot a means to an end. It is an end itself\u201f (ibid). But isn\u201ft the real challenge for cultural \npolicy analysts and practitioners to identify the ways in which cultures can be funded, \nsupported or created using the public purse in ways which are democratic and \naccountable? To support one person\u201fs or groups\u201f culture is also to make a decision not to \nsupport another\u201fs; on what bases do we make these decisions?  \nThe primary focus of Belfiore\u201fs paper is a critique of the overly ambitious \nassertions of some in the arts and heritage sectors as to the ability of their programmes to \naddress, seemingly, all social ills. As I have argued in relation to the use of arts marketing \nand economic impact arguments in the Australian cultural policy context (Gibson, 1999a, \n2001 & 2002a) so too Belfiore points to the limitations of the evidence which is \ncommissioned and presented to justify and \u201eprove\u201f the social impact of the arts and \nheritage. Where I want to part ways with Belfiore however is in her conclusion that bad \nevidence and over hyped statements of social, cultural or even economic significance \nmeans that instrumental cultural policies are \u201epolicies of extinction\u201f (ibid.). On the \ncontrary, I argue that instrumentalism has always been integral to cultural policy, and that \ninstrumental cultural policies are policies of production.   \nIn the first place this paper will argue that the oft repeated assertion of a recently \nintroduced instrumentality in cultural policy has no basis in historical fact. While others \nhave covered aspects of this historical ground (see for instance Bennett 1995 & 1998; \nGibson, 1999b & 2001; and, O\u201fNeill, this issue) in view of the seeming wholesale \ncollective memory loss of cultural policy\u201fs history in the recent \u201einstrumentality\u201f debate it \nseems timely to briefly remind ourselves that cultural institutions and programmes, \nwhether government funded or supported privately, have had an instrumental dimension \nsince before the Thatcher or New Labour Governments in the UK. In the second place \nthis article will review some of the languages which inform recent discussions of \n\u201einstrumentality\u201f. There is a long history to the discourses which inform the current \ndiscussion of instrumentality and culture. Many cultural theorists have discussed this \nlineage in various ways (for instance, the recent contributions from Belfiore and Bennett, \n2007 and 2006) but despite the well established nature of this lineage, discussions of \n\u201einstrumentality\u201f in contemporary cultural policy often proceed from the basis that the \n4 \nL. Gibson  Cultural Trends \nCorresponding author: L. Gibson. Email: lg80@le.ac.uk \n \ndebate is novel. However, as we will see in relation to discussions of instrumentality and \nmuseums, there is no consensus over what constitutes \u201einstrumental\u201f activities and which \nare \u201eintrinsic\u201f. I will argue that not only is the instrumental\/ intrinsic dichotomy false but \nit does not assist us in thinking about the specific operations of particular programme and \npolicy environments, such as museums, where the complexity of purpose and operation \ncannot be reduced to a simplistic binary opposition.  The \u201einstrumentalisation debate\u201f \nalso has a lot to say about cultural personnel, this discursive thread also has a history in \ndialectical discussions of culture and administration (Adorno, 1991). On one view \npersonnel can be neatly mapped against the culture and administration divide so that \npolicy makers, administrators, and managers become actors who merely respond to \nalready established government programmes, on the other side are \u201ecritical intellectuals\u201f \nwho, because of their untied status\u2013 usually academic\u2013 are able to have a critical \nperspective on the programmes of government and the management of culture not \navailable to the cultural administrators. In the final section of this paper I want to reject \nthese dialectics not in order to propose a remaking of the lost truth of culture and its \nadministration but in order to propose a corrective to the terms in which the current \ndiscussion of instrumentalisation in relation, especially, to the museums and heritage \nsector is conducted.  \n \nCultural policy is constitutively instrumental  \nI want to commence with a brief schematic outline of some key recent historical \nmoments\u2013 by which I mean the last two hundred years\u2013 of cultural programmes and \npolicy in Anglophone countries. My main intention here is to remind readers that there is \nnothing remotely new about instrumentalism in cultural policy. In fact, if we consider the \nhistory of the modern public museum, for instance, we find that it is in fact constitutively \ninstrumental as has been well established, for instance, in various histories of British and \nAustralian museums (e.g. Bennett, 1995 & 1998; Gibson, 1999b & 2001). There is \nnothing new about the use of cultural programmes to affect a population\u201fs health. \nFamously Henry Cole, the architect of the South Kensington Museum system (later the \nV&A), justified public expenditure on the gas lighting of the museum in order to enable \nevening opening and thus provide a healthy alternative to the gin palaces of nineteenth \n5 \nL. Gibson  Cultural Trends \nCorresponding author: L. Gibson. Email: lg80@le.ac.uk \n \ncentury London. The use of cultural programmes to affect national economic or trade \ngoals is not a Thatcher innovation. Before the \u201erational recreation\u201f ethos which came to \ndominate museum discourse in the late nineteenth century the argument for public \nexpenditure on the development of the South Kensington museum and the Schools of \nDesign was economic. Specifically these cultural programmes were to provide an \neducation in good design to \u201emechanicks\u201f in an attempt to improve the flagging national \nlace industry which was losing out to better designed product imported from Italy \n(Gibson, 1999b).  Nor is the use of cultural programmes to effect community cohesion an \ninvention of New Labour, the first Chair of the Arts Council was economist Maynard \nKeynes whose aim to \u201epump prime\u201f the arts was, at least in the very early years of the \nArts Council\u201fs history, to do with community rebuilding after WWII (Gibson, 1997 & \n1999b). In Australia too it was the economist H.C. Coombs most associated with a range \nof cultural programmes which aimed to educate the returning soldier and the post-war \ncitizen in order to enable them to contribute better to post-war reconstruction efforts \n(Gibson, 2001 & 2002b). Neither is culture\u201fs use for urban, social and economic \nregeneration a recent invention. See for instance, Suzanne MacLeod\u201fs discussion of the \nreasons for the late nineteenth century development of the Walker Art Gallery and the \ncultural institutions with which it is co-sited in Liverpool. MacLeod demonstrates how \nthis was part of a programme of municipal development which, in addition to building \nwhat in today\u201fs terms would be described a \u201ecultural quarter\u201f, also involved the \ninstallation of sewers and fresh water supplies in an aim to address \u201ethe highest mortality \nrates of any town in the country, including London\u201f (2005, 14). In all of these historical \nexamples cultural programmes and policies have quite specific instrumental aims. \nIt is not that the absence of history from some discussions of contemporary \ncultural policy which allows them to understand instrumentalism as a recent \u201ethreat\u201f to \ncultural policy is merely a question of semantics, far from it. The key point here is that, as \nO\u201fNeill puts it in relation to museums in his contribution to this issue,\u201f the lack of \nhistorical context means that museums can be presented as being outside history, as \nhaving an unchanging essence which is now under attack\u201f  (this issue). In relation to \nstudies of cultural programmes more generally Tony Bennett, Francis Dodsworth and \nPatrick Joyce have argued that despite the valuable contributions made by detailed \n6 \nL. Gibson  Cultural Trends \nCorresponding author: L. Gibson. Email: lg80@le.ac.uk \n \nstudies of contemporary cultural institutions, policies and programmes they usually \noperate \u201ewithin quite short time lines with the consequence that the present is often \nbrought into view too conjuncturally by being separated off from the longer histories of \nits formation\u201f (2007, 526). The discussions of instrumentality in the recent cultural policy \nliterature are a case in point. Despite the excellent work which has been done \ndeconstructing the overblown claims made by some arts and heritage advocates and the \npoor quality of some of the evidence commissioned and used by the cultural sector, to \nconclude from this that instrumentalism per se is a \u201ethreat\u201f is to hand over rationales for \nculture\u201fs management to those who believe that cultural funding and management needs \nno justification and should not be accounted for because certain people \u201ejust know\u201f what \nis worthy. The Anglophone history of cultural policy tells us that to allow the \nmanagement of culture to be determined without reference to public accountability \nresults in cultural support and management which is exclusivist in its basic logic (for \ninstance, for a critique of museum policy and programmes see Hooper-Greenhill 2000 & \n1992). The recently released \u201eMcMaster report\u201f, Supporting Excellence in the Arts, is a \ndirect result of the overt criticism of the British government\u201fs \u201einstrumentalism\u201f in \nrelation to the arts (McMaster, 2008). It is an excellent example of the types of policy \nproscriptions which result from a return to a discourse based on \u201eprovide excellence and \nthey will come\u201f, most notoriously in its proposal to open high cultural institutions to the \ngeneral public for free for a week every year (2008, 17). Such simplistic \u201eaccess\u201f \nmeasures take no account of the myriad of research which shows that access and \nparticipation is influenced by a range of complex factors and is not simply a matter of \nreducing the entrance fee. For instance, despite the introduction of free entry to British \nnational museums and galleries in 2001, MORI have shown that \u201ethe profile of a typical \n\u201cpopulation\u201d of museum and gallery visitors have remained stable, and firmly biased in \nfavour of the \u201ctraditional\u201d visitor groups\u201f (2003, 4). In other words, when the national \nmuseums in England dropped their entrance fees this did not broaden the audience for \nmuseums but rather meant that the already existing primarily middle class audience went \nmore often. So according to the recent debate what then constitutes the instrumental and \nintrinsic qualities of museums? \n \n7 \nL. Gibson  Cultural Trends \nCorresponding author: L. Gibson. Email: lg80@le.ac.uk \n \nInstrumental and intrinsic cultural policy \nMy intention here is not to revisit theoretical and philosophical debates on the \ninstrumental and intrinsic dialectics of cultural policy and cultural value; this has been \ndone at length elsewhere.\n1\n Instead I want to explore here the ways in which these \ncategorisations have been played out in recent discussions of heritage and museum policy \nand the problems inherent in attempting to characterise contemporary cultural initiatives \nas either one or the other.  \nClive Gray\u201fs contribution to this volume proposes that we can understand \nmuseum policy as being driven by \u201eendogenous and exogenous motors of policy change \nand development\u201f (Gray, this issue). His identification of the \u201ecore\u201f or \u201eendogenous\u201f parts \nof the museums and galleries sector comprises \u201ecuratorship, education, entertainment and \nthe infra-structural management of resources\u201f (ibid). \u201eInstrumentality\u201f according to Gray,  \nwould mean a shift away from these \u2026 towards other policy intentions. This \nwould mean that internal matters of policy emphasis concerned with the sector\u201fs \ncore\u2026 would become replaced by a concern for externally derived objectives or \npolicy priorities, such as, social inclusion or community regeneration (ibid.).  \nHowever, the examples Gray gives of \u201eexternally derived objectives\u201f\u2013 social inclusion \nand community regeneration\u2013 are often inextricably part of museum education \nprogrammes which Gray defines as \u201eendogenous\u201f or \u201ecore\u201f museum functions. \nFurthermore, it is precisely the museums educational functions which others classify as \ninstrumental. \nJohn Holden\u201fs co called \u201enew language\u201f for \u201ecultural value\u201f was initially \ndeveloped with Robert Hewison in an evaluation framework commissioned by the \nHeritage Lottery Fund (HLF) in 2004. The resulting Challenge and Change report first \nproposed the triangular framework for the assessment of cultural value which Holden has \nsince developed (see Holden 2006 & 2004). This framework is made up of intrinsic \nvalues, instrumental benefits and institutional values (Hewison & Holden, 2004). \nAccording to Kate Clark, the HLF\u201fs Deputy Director of Policy and Research, and Gareth \nMaeer, a HLF Policy Advisor, the instrumental benefits proposed by Hewison and \n                                                 \n1\n See for example Belfiore & Bennett, 2007 for a review of the key literature; in relation to heritage values \nGibson and Pendlebury, 2009; McGuigan, 1996; Bennett, 1998 especially chapter 8 and 2000 for a \nresponse to McGuigan\u201fs critiques; Y\u00fadice, 2003, and for a critique of Y\u00fadice see Osborne, 2006. \n8 \nL. Gibson  Cultural Trends \nCorresponding author: L. Gibson. Email: lg80@le.ac.uk \n \nHolden included \u201elearning, individual well-being, strengthened local communities; \nprosperity\u201f (Clark & Maeer, 2008, 26). So while as we have seen for Gray education or \n\u201elearning\u201f is not instrumental, in contrast, for Holden education is an instrumental benefit \nof culture. Indeed at the annual Museum Association conference in 2007 Holden had to \ndefend his list of \u201einstrumental\u201f and \u201eintrinsic\u201f values from robust critique by a number of \nsenior museum directors and educationists. These practitioners interpreted his \ncategorisation of \u201elearning\u201f as an instrumental quality as an elitist attack on the \nsignificant efforts made in the museum sector especially over the last twenty years to \nmake museums more accessible and relevant to wider cross sections of the tax paying \npublic. This \u201enew museology\u201f has been most associated with the development of \neducation programmes which aim to be inclusive both by bringing new material culture \ninto museums as well as new audiences (Vergo, 1989). While for Gray education is not \ninstrumental some of the other \u201eaccess and inclusion\u201f measures associated with museum \neducation programmes are; for Holden, on the other hand, all of these learning or access \nbased initiatives are not \u201eintrinsic\u201f to the museums function but are instrumental.  \nIn contrast Carol Scott reporting on an audience study at the Powerhouse Museum \nin Sydney, Australia, despite using the Holden framework, deems learning an \u201eintangible\u201f \nand therefore intrinsic benefit of museums. There are a number of other qualities she \nidentifies from her research participants, responses which despite their clear \ninstrumentalism, as generally defined, she deems \u201eintangible\u201f. The \u201eintangible\u201f benefits \nshe identifies include \u201eaccess to the past\u201f illustrated by a respondent\u201fs statement that \u201eour \ncommunity needs to learn about it\u201fs history, to \u2026 develop ourselves further from the \nmistakes and achievements of others\u201f (2006, 66). Further evidence of the \u201eintangible\u201f \nvalues provided by the Powerhouse are evidenced in a respondent\u201fs comment on the \nbenefits of learning about Australia\u201fs indigenous history. Summarising the intangible \nbenefits Scott concluded \u201ethat museums provided people with accessible, tangible \nlearning experiences\u201f (ibid, 67). Is a museum programme which aims to offer people an \nalternative view of history with the goal of facilitating community cohesion an \u201eintrinsic\u201f \nbenefit of a museum programme, as it is for Scott? Or is, at least, the community \ncohesion element of such a programme, an \u201eexogenous\u201f activity for the museum and thus \n9 \nL. Gibson  Cultural Trends \nCorresponding author: L. Gibson. Email: lg80@le.ac.uk \n \nsuch a programme is an example of the museum being used \u201einstrumentally\u201f, as it is for \nGray? \nIt is clear then that there is no consensus about what particular elements of \nmuseum and heritage programmes might constitute instrumental or intrinsic values. This \nlack of clarity militates against the assessment of the \u201einstrumental\u201f outcomes of \nparticular cultural programmes. Clark and Maeer\u201fs discussion of the application of the \nHewison and Holden evaluation framework to HLF projects is enlightening on the \ndifficulties experienced attempting to evaluate using some of its \u201einstrumental\u201f elements. \nThey found that the only way they could measure categories of \u201elearning\u201f, \u201estrengthening \nlocal communities\u201f and \u201ewellbeing\u201f was through \u201esocial impact case studies\u201f which were \nshort term and produced research which was \u201eavowedly anecdotal\u201f (2008, 49). Clark and \nMaeer describe how the research found that the categories of \u201elearning\u201f and \u201ewell-being\u201f \nwere more prominent than the wider community benefits linked to \u201estrengthening local \ncommunities\u201f. They surmise that this was because \u201ethese wider benefits are more difficult \nto achieve, that they are more difficult to detect without dedicated long-term research, or \n\u2026 simply because the concepts and mechanisms for such social change are so little \nunderstood\u201f (2008, 50). One could also surmise that evaluative elements such as \n\u201estrengthening local communities\u201f are too vague to be useful as a concrete category to \nwhich research might be applied; for instance, what is meant by \u201estrengthening\u201f, is this in \nthe economic sense or is this about neighbourhood cohesion; how would this be \nmeasured, and so on.\n2\n But is this a problem because of the so called instrumentality of \ncultural programmes per se or is this due to a problematic research framework and \nmethod?  \nIn an article critical of the British government\u201fs requirement for museums to \naffect social inclusion Celine West and Charlotte Smith make a series of valuable points \nregarding the lack of clarity in government directives in relation to cultural policy and \nsocial inclusion (2005). Speaking from inside the museum sector they recognise that the \ndevelopment of inclusive museum programmes is central to the modus operandi of \ncontemporary museums. However, they argue \u201ethat a high level of expectation is \n                                                 \n2\n See Merli, 2002 for a discussion of vague impact measurements in her critique of Fran\u00e7ois Matarasso's \nUse or Ornament?. See also Gibson 2009 for a discussion of the problems with community consultation in \nheritage policy. \n10 \nL. Gibson  Cultural Trends \nCorresponding author: L. Gibson. Email: lg80@le.ac.uk \n \ncombined with minimal indication of how museums may implement such generalised \npoints as engaging with the socially excluded: the terminology used is often vague and \nhence defeats the objective\u201f (2005, 279). The persistence of this outmoded language \nwhich insists on understanding culture and its management in terms of its \u201eintrinsic\u201f and \n\u201einstrumental\u201f values militates against cultural management which is articulated to \ndemocratic access, representation and accountability. For museum and heritage \nmanagement this means supporting programmes which aim to make museums relevant to \nthe contemporary British public, in all its diversity. This might mean exploring ways of \nachieving a better relevance in the ways museum collections are displayed by, for \ninstance, diversifying the types the material culture on display or exploring new modes \nfor the presentation to others of intangible heritage. That such programmes are concerned \nwith communities who are not part of the \u201etraditional\u201f museum going public does not \nmean that these programmes are external or \u201eexogenous\u201f to the museums function and \ntherefore \u201einstrumental\u201f, on the contrary, the drive to achieve representation and \nrelevance is the basic defining discourse for the twenty-first century public \u201epost-\nmuseum\u201f (Hooper-Greenhill, 2000).  \n \nIn defence of instrumentality\u2013 the critical and the practical \nSo as cultural policy, museum and heritage studies researchers, practitioners or \nadministrators how then are we to think through culture and its administration in relation \nto the current critique of \u201einstrumental\u201f cultural policies and programmes? Should we be \npracticing so called \u201eprogressive\u201f critique, where we take the \u201eprogressive\u201f status of our \ncritique as self-evident, and which is always critical of arts policy, arts evidence, and \nsuspicious of any claims which art might make for itself (Miller & Y\u00fadice, 2002)? Or \nanother choice might be analysis which takes cultural policies and programmes at face \nvalue (Schuster, 2002). Such is Oliver Bennett\u201fs categorisation of the \u201etorn halves of \ncultural policy research\u201f (2004). For Bennett, the first position, in its simplistic dismissal \nof subsidised culture as elite, ignores \u201eany recognition that the arts can act as an \nemancipatory resource for all classes\u201f (ibid, 240). The second position, in its constitution \nof cultural policy as limited to programmes developed by the state or government \nagencies and its interest almost exclusively in empirical and operational concerns leaves \n11 \nL. Gibson  Cultural Trends \nCorresponding author: L. Gibson. Email: lg80@le.ac.uk \n \nno space for the analysis of the historically and culturally specific discourses and their \npower effects which are constructed and reproduced through them (ibid, 242\u2013244). For \nBennett these are \u201ethe torn halves that never add up to a whole;\u2026 research can be \npractical, or it can be critical, but it can never be both at the same time\u201f (ibid, 246). \nBennett does not attempt to rejoin these \u201etorn halves\u201f rather he proposes that despite the \nsundering nevertheless  \nthe field of cultural policy research is still defined by a shared commitment to \ninvestigating the conditions under which culture is produced, reproduced and \nexperienced. This is a complex and multifaceted task, requiring a broad range of \nintellectual practices, none of which holds a monopoly (ibid.).  \nFor Jim McGuigan however the resolution is not so clear. He asks two questions, \u201ehow \ncan critical intellectuals be practical?\u201f and \u201ehow can practical intellectuals be critical?\u201f \n(1996, 190). McGuigan\u201fs aim, drawing on Jurgen Habermas, is to recover \u201etheoretically \ninformed practice\u201f (praxis) from its reduction to mere technical means (techne) (ibid, \n187). For McGuigan this division between praxis and techne maps conveniently onto \nemployment positions within the cultural sector, so critical intellectuals are academics \nand other \u201euntied\u201f intellectuals, and practical intellectuals are those engaged in \u201esome \nform of communication and cultural management\u201f(ibid, 190). McGuigan is quite clear \nabout the relative ability of these positions to be critical, this is revealed in the way he \ncaricatures the practical intellectual who he thinks might be \u201edisappointed\u201f in his book as \n\u201eit does not purport to provide recipe knowledge\u201f. According to McGuigan this is \u201eto do \nwith fact that the possibilities of critical knowledge in a practical context have already \nbeen closed off\u201f (ibid, 190). It is for this reason that McGuigan argues that \u201equestions of \ncultural policy are too important to be left solely to cultural technicians\u201f (ibid, 188).  \nThis argument makes little sense when applied to museums and the museum profession. \nIf we take the example of the training of museum practitioners in the key museum studies \ncourses in Britain- Leicester, Manchester and Newcastle for instance- students \ncompleting these courses are better placed than most to engage with the continuing \nexclusionary practices of some museums and museum professionals. The courses are \ndesigned to give them a historical and theoretical understanding which allows them a \ncritical perspective on museum operations. Crucially, in addition, they are given a \n12 \nL. Gibson  Cultural Trends \nCorresponding author: L. Gibson. Email: lg80@le.ac.uk \n \ntechnical understanding of museum operations which allows them, for instance, to \nunderstand how technical aspects of display can best be utilised to design exhibitions \nwhich are not exclusionary in their architecture. Thus, the \u201etechnical\u201f knowledge they \ngain is not secondary to the historical and theoretical understandings of museums that \nthey are encouraged to develop. On the contrary, without the technical knowledge they \nwould not be able to practice in a historically and theoretically informed critical way. I \nargue in contrast to McGuigan that it is this combination of theoretical, historical and \ntechnical knowledges that make these \u201ecultural technicians\u201f best equipped to think about \nand respond to \u201equestions of cultural policy\u201f.  \nThe best critical analyses can only be those which engage with the detailed \nspecifics of the institution, policy or programme in question. Such analyses of the \nparticular necessitate leaving behind worn categorisations such as \u201einstrumentalism\u201f and \nrequire attention to the specificity of particular contexts. This results in more nuanced \nunderstandings of the dynamics and effects of cultural programmes. \nLet us consider briefly the National Gallery\u201fs purchase of Raphael\u201fs \u201eMadonna of \nthe Pinks\u201f for \u00a322 million in 2004. The purchase can be schematically characterised in \ntwo different ways. On the one hand, we can think of this massive expenditure of public \nmoney as evidence of a continuing elitism in the raison d\u201f\u00eatre of the National Gallery. On \nthe other hand, we can take at face value the National Gallery\u201fs presentation of the \npainting which is that the Raphael is symbolic not of Christianity or a particular art \nhistory but of motherhood and therefore was an important purchase for the nation due to \nits universal appeal. One of the conditions imposed by the HLF on the National Gallery \nwhen they gave it the loan to purchase the Raphael was that the Gallery should make the \npicture \u201eaccessible\u201f to non-traditional museum audiences. Thus the Gallery toured the \n\u201eMadonna\u201f around the regions and organised a programme which targeted various \nexcluded communities, including teenage single mothers in the Welsh Valley\u201fs and \nchildren in remote rural areas in the North East. These groups were dutifully bussed to \nthe nearest Gallery to gaze upon the \u201eGreat Art\u201f and be duly changed forever by their \nexposure. This is a classic case of the \u201einstrumentalism\u201f that the commentators bemoan \nand it is easy to caricature and indeed be offended by such a program, which takes people \nexperiencing real economic and social difficulties to see a \u00a322 million pound painting in \n13 \nL. Gibson  Cultural Trends \nCorresponding author: L. Gibson. Email: lg80@le.ac.uk \n \nthe expectation that this will somehow change their lives. It does not take a \u201ecritical\u201f \nintellectual to recognise a poor program and it is programs like this that continue to make \nthe arts an easy target. But is this because of \u201einstrumentalism\u201f? The fact that the painting \nis being used as a tool for something is surely central to the very meaning of this painting, \nafter all this is a painting specifically designed to be an instrument for personal worship. \nHelen Rees Leahy gives a more nuanced critique of the programmes \naccompanying the purchase of the \u201eMadonna of the Pinks\u201f. She describes how in addition \nto the national tour which aimed to expose the Raphael to \u201ediverse\u201f audiences, at the \nsame time the painting featured in a blockbuster, \u201eRaphael: from Urbino to Rome\u201f, \norganised at the Gallery in 2004\/5. This exhibition and its organisation had all the \nattributes of a traditional elite museum exhibition:  \nconservative scholarship that privileges the expertise of the connoisseur; a \nmonographic focus rather than thematic perspectives; visible participation in a \nnetwork of cultural capital via prestigious loans from peer institutions; \nsponsorship form a blue chip company\u2026 (Rees Leahy, 2007, 710)  \nWas the \u201eaccess\u201f tour of the regions merely a ruse to get the funding from the HLF? Or \nare these seemingly contradictory programmes better viewed, as Rees Leahy argues, as \nevidence of a complex institution in which there is \u201ea mixed economy of cultural \nmanagement that  accommodates connoisseurship and populism, exclusivity and \ndiversity, incongruity and contradiction\u201f (ibid, 699). The point here is not that we can or \nshould apologise for the elitism of some museum programmes or the poor quality of \nothers by presenting a relativistic analysis of the institutions internal culture. Rather it is \nto propose that in order to work critically with institutions, policies and programmes it is \nnecessary to engage with the practicalities of their arrangements. To do so is to recognise \nthe complexity of institutions which are often, and museums are a great example of this, \ninternally divided. While commentators continue to simply deconstruct the \n\u201einstrumentalist\u201f cultural policy agenda the reality is that some cultural institutions \ncontinue to pay, at best, lip service to the political imperative to become more inclusive. \nThis political imperative requires museums to become more representative in their \ncollections and to think differently about the ways material cultures are displayed in order \n14 \nL.

I have argued that far from there being a division between the \ncritical and practical which means that it is not possible to be both critical and practical; \non the contrary, valid critique is only possible through attendance to the technical \ncontexts and conditions for cultural policy and programmes. Such an analysis would have \nto reject simplistic dichotomies such as \u201einstrumentalism\u201f and \u201eintrinsic\u201f as concepts \nunable to describe and therefore enable critical engagement with the specificities of a \ncultural institutions or programmes operation. If the findings of Pierre Bourdieu (1984) \nand more recently in the British context, Bennett et al (2006 & 2004) are correct, then \ncultural programmes and their consumption have real social and political power effects. \nIn this social and political context critical engagement which is grounded in the \npracticalities of culture\u201fs administration is crucial if we are to develop analyses which \nseek to understand and contribute to the development of programmes which break with \nthe elitisms which have characterised cultural programmes in the past. I want to conclude \nwith a comment from Mark O\u201fNeill who argues that \u201ethe implications of the fact that the \ntwin processes of inclusion and exclusion are self-reinforcing systems are very clear: any \norganization that is not working to break down barriers to access is actively maintaining \nthem. Neutrality is not possible\u201f (2002, 34). \n \nAcknowledgments \nThanks to Richard Sandell, Sandra Dudley and an anonymous reviewer for useful comments on \nearlier versions of this paper.
