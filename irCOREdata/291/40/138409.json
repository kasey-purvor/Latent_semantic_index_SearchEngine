Towill, Cardiff Business School, Cardiff University, Colum Drive,\nCardiff, CF10 3EU\nThis paper examines the issues underlying the appropriate matching of pipelines to\nmarketplace needs under conditions of demand volatility and price pressure. It\ndescribes a scenario where the philosophy of \u201cone size fits all\u201d does not apply to\npipeline design, implementation, and control. The paper reports on research\nconducted by the authors and others on how appropriate global supply chain strategies\ncan be developed contingent upon market characteristics and which seek\nsimultaneously to achieve higher levels of customer responsiveness at less total cost\nto the supply chain as a whole. The selection of the right strategy within a supply\nchain lends itself to a taxonomic approach. We find that three dimensions (leading to\neight possible configurations) are adequate for this purpose. These key dimensions\nare product characteristics, demand characteristics and replenishment lead-time.\nOver the last decade or so, there has emerged a view that recognises that the route to\ncompetitive advantage lies through the supply chain. Indeed, it has been suggested\nthat \u201csupply chains compete, not companies\u201d (1). The idea being that the unique set\nof relations that typify the web of inter-connections between organisations in a\nnetwork enable the achievement of competitive advantage through lower costs and\/or\ngreater differentiation.\nBecause of the complexity of todays supply chains, due in part to out-sourcing and\nglobalisation, the way in which these relationships are structured and managed can\nmake the difference between profit and loss.\nAs McCullen and Towill (2) have shown, globalisation of supply chains compounds\nthe logistical problem along three dimensions. These are replenishment level; time;\nand distance. Hence a marketplace ripple can be amplified and distorted as it passes\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 2\nfrom, say, the UK to Indonesia. Furthermore, there may well be a significant delay\nbefore any response occurs at (say) the raw material supplier. Additionally, customer\nchoice and the nature of the product means that in pipeline terms \u201cone size does not fit\nall\u201d (3, 4). Hence matching the pipeline to the product is a key issue in the\nengineering of global supply chains.\nMany marketplaces are now highly volatile and demand is difficult to predict. The\nacceleration of technological and fashion changes has additionally resulted in\nextremely short product life cycles. In this new environment non-availability means\nthat in the event of non-supply the particular sales opportunity is lost forever (5).\nConsequently the focus in supply chain management must shift from the idea of cost\nas the order winner to responsiveness as the market winner. The implication is that\nthe emphasis in supply chain management in the future must be on agility.\nAgility implies the ability of the supply chain to react quickly to changes in market\ndemand \u2013 be they changes in volume, variety or mix. The characteristics of the agile\nsupply chain have been described elsewhere (6), but it is useful to contrast agility with\nthe philosophy of lean operations. Lean thinking is most often associated with the car\nassembly industry and Japan in particular. Agility & leanness are not opposing\nphilosophies, rather they work best in certain contexts as Table 1 suggests.\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 3\nDISTINGUISHING\nATTRIBUTES\nLEAN SUPPLY AGILE SUPPLY\nTypical Products Commodities Fashion Goods\nMarketplace Demand Predictable Volatile\nProduct Variety Low High\nProduct Life Cycle Long Short\nCustomer Drivers Cost Availability\nProfit Margin Low High\nDominant Costs Physical Costs Marketability\nStockout Penalties Long Term Contractual Immediate and Volatile\nPurchasing Policy Buy Goods Assign Capacity\nInformation Enrichment Highly Desirable Obligatory\nForecasting mechanism Algorithmic Consultative\nTable 1\nComparison of Lean Supply with Agile Supply : the Distinguishing Features\n(Source: Mason-Jones, Naylor and Towill (7))\nQuick Response Movement\nThe Quick Response (QR) movement originating in the USA textile and apparel\nindustries can be seen as an excellent model for time-compressing supply chains\nbecause of its emphasis on co-operative efforts among all members of the chain from\nraw materials right through to the end customer (8). The catalyst for the QR\nmovement in apparel was competition from offshore manufacturers. For example in\n1988, 50 percent of the apparel and textiles purchased in the United States were\nimported from the Orient. The outcome of the debate over how best to respond to this\nsituation within the industry was the formation of the QR movement.\nThe Council also recognised that \u201ccloser to the customer\u201d means closer in time more\nthan closer in distance. In Hill\u2019s (9) terminology the \u201cmarket winner\u201d in apparel is\nfashion, and in the fashion business timing is everything since today\u2019s style is\ntomorrow\u2019s markdown (10). Hence successful firms are those that can ride the latest\nwave of fashion. For apparel manufacturers, response time is the key. So it is\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 4\nessential to judge quickly what is selling and move it through the pipeline and onto\nthe racks before competitors (11).\nQuick response provides a remedy to this problem by compressing the total pipeline,\nthus eliminating some of those efficiency losses by moving manufacturing closer to\nthe consumer\u2019s buying decision. Long pipelines also means that forecast horizons are\nextended with the inevitable impact on forecast errors. As a rule of thumb the\nforecast errors are as follows:\n\uf0b7 Start of Season \u00b1 10%\n\uf0b7 Minus 16 weeks \u00b1 20%\n\uf0b7 Minus 26 weeks \u00b1 40%\nQR has been defined at length by Lowson et al (12) as:\n\u201cA state of responsiveness and flexibility in which an organisation seeks to provide a\nhighly diverse range of products and services to a customer\/consumer in the exact\nquantity, variety and quality, and at the right time, place and price as dictated by real-\ntime customer\/consumer demand. QR provides the ability to make demand\ninformation driven decisions at the last possible moment in time ensuring that\ndiversity of offering is maximised and lead-times, expenditure, cost and inventory\nminimised. QR places an emphasis upon flexibility and product velocity in order to\nmeet the changing requirements of a highly competitive, volatile and dynamic\nmarketplace. QR encompasses a strategy, structure, culture and set of operational\nprocedures aimed at integrating enterprises in a mutual network through rapid\ninformation transfer and profitable exchange of activity.\u201d\nThe significant conceptual breakthrough made in the QR movement was identifying\nand exploiting the fact that the supply chain is a system of bi-directional flows. So\ngoods flow forward from the textile producer to the customer and information about\nconsumer demand, orders, and capacity commitments flows backward to apparel and\ntextile manufacturers. In control systems terminology this is a system with both\ninformation feedforward and feedback, the advantages of which have been ably\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 5\ndemonstrated by Wikner et al (13) and Mason-Jones and Towill (14). The innovative\nfeature of QR is that actions are taken to increase the velocity of flows in both\ndirections. The QR campaign involves re-engineering the pipeline to move apparel\nforward faster; that is, to shrink cycle times at each stage of manufacture and the\nshipment times between stages. However the important actions were those taken to\nimprove the responsiveness of the system through improved, faster communication of\nconsumer preferences to all members of the chain.\nFig. 1. Sequential Information Flow Causing Bullwhip In A \u201cTraditional\u201d\nClothing Supply Chain\n(Source: McCullen and Towill (2), based on the description by Stalk and Hout\n(15))\nUnlike the \u201ctraditional\u201d, bullwhip generating, clothing supply chain described by\nStalk and Hout (15), and shown schematically in Fig. 1, Quick Response is built upon\na partnership involving each link in the chain from the producer of textiles right\nthrough to the retailer who sells the garment to the customer. The desired\npartnerships in QR extend beyond the paired relationships between supplier and buyer\nthat are found in JIT systems; each link in the chain shares information about sales,\nFabric\nmaker\nYarn\nmaker\nGarment\nmaker\nHigh\nstreet\nretailer\nFlow of orders upstream\nFlow of materials downstream\nC\nus\nto\nm\ner\ns\nOrder\nfluctuations\nare typically\n+\/-5%\nOrder\nfluctuations\nare typically\n+\/-10%\nOrder\nfluctuations\nare typically\n+\/-20%\nOrder\nfluctuations\nare typically\n+\/-40%\n(hence\namplification\nhere+2x2x2=8\ntimes greater\nthen marketplace\nvariability)\nDirection of demand amplification and increasing variability\nand uncertainty as the waveform moves upstream\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 6\norders, and inventories with the others. Retailers communicate information about\nsales, not only to the apparel manufacturer, but also back to the textile producer.\nMutual co-operation among all partners is required if the system is to succeed in its\ngoal of increasing sales with less inventory in the total system. A successful\npartnership means higher inventory turns and improved return on investment for each\nlink in the chain.\nA trend to off-shore sourcing\nAs we have previously noted, offshore sourcing and manufacturing has been an\nincreasing trend across much of Western industry for several decades. The\nmotivation for this tendency to offshore sourcing has been primarily cost. However,\nit could be argued that the concept of cost that has been employed in those decisions\nis narrow in the extreme because the cost criteria employed is essentially the unit cost\nof manufacture or purchase. Costs such as those associated with today\u2019s wider view\nof the supply chain are often ignored. Thus rarely is a realistic charge placed upon the\nadditional inventory that inevitably will be created as pipelines lengthen, neither is a\ncost placed upon the risk that this might generate in terms of obsolescence, equally\nthe impact on the firm\u2019s agility is not factored into the equation.\nWhole sectors of industry \u2013 particularly in electronics and clothing \u2013 have migrated to\nthe Far East as the search for lower labour cost intensifies. Strangely, even industries\nwhere labour costs represent only a small part of total value-added such as semi-\nconductor fabrication have been seduced by this general trend.\nA study by Lowson (16) of fifty European Union retailers found that 70% of their\ntotal purchases came from outside the EU at purchase prices up to 35% lower than\ncould be obtained locally. Companies such as Marks & Spencer who as recently as\n1990 sourced almost 100% of their garments in the British Isles (UK and Republic of\nIreland) had reduced this by half by 2000. A shirt sourced in Indonesia could be\npurchased by Marks & Spencer buyers for \u00a32.69 compared to \u00a36.01 in Northern\nIreland (17).\nLowson also highlighted the fact that the retailers in his study were typically working\non order to delivery lead-times of between 48 and 60 weeks when ordering from\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 7\nAsian sources. This clearly inhibits their agility and has the potential to place\nthemselves at some risk if demand for those products does not come up to\nexpectations.\nThe same survey also examined the extent to which retailers\u2019 flexibility was affected\nby their choice of sourcing location. The findings are summarised in Table 2 below.\nTake in table 2\nTo highlight the differences in flexibility and responsiveness by source location we\nhave applied a numerical weight to each column as follows:-\nNone x 0\nSome x 1\nSubstantial x 3\nThe three resulting scores are then summed and divided by 300% (the maximum\npossible score) to produce a metric highlighting volume and mix responsiveness\nbefore and after the sales season commences. It seeks to provide a single aggregate\n\u201cscore\u201d which sheds insight into sourcing decisions, especially when coupled with\nvendor lead times.\nTable 3 shows the resulting scores along with the average lead-time that the\nrespondents associated with each sourcing location.\nTake in table 3\nThese results suggest that the loss of flexibility that results from sourcing offshore can\nbe significant. The paradox is that these data are derived from retailers themselves\nbut dramatic though they may be, they seem not to influence the manufacturing cost-\nbased sourcing decisions. Whilst these findings result from a survey of retailers they\nare not dissimilar to the experience of companies in industries such as electronics or\nhigh technology generally.\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 8\nWhat is called for is a wider definition of costs which is based upon total supply chain\ncosts. The limited definition of cost that is still the main driver in sourcing decisions\n(i.e. unit manufacturing or purchase cost) is clearly inadequate and will not reflect the\ntrue total costs of ownership. True supply chain costs need to incorporate such\nelements as:-\n\uf0b7 Inventory carrying costs\n\uf0b7 cost of mark-downs\n\uf0b7 cost of loss sales\n\uf0b7 transaction costs (including letters of credit, customs clearance)\n\uf0b7 transportation (including emergency airfreight)\n\uf0b7 warehousing\n\uf0b7 duties\nThere will be many occasions where, even taking all the above costs into account, it\nwill still make sense to source in low-cost, offshore locations. For example, standard\nproducts with limited variation in demand. However for other products where\ndemand is much more volatile and harder to predict, local sourcing may be preferable.\nThe Concept of Separating Baseline and Surge DemandsA further option exists for\na hybrid strategy where low-cost sourcing is adopted for the \u2018base\u2019 level demand (i.e.\na minimum level of potential demand based upon past experience) with more\nresponsive sourcing to cope with demand above that level. See Figure 2 below:-\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 9\nFigure 2 : Separating Base and Surge Demand\nSplitting sourcing in this way enables demand forecasts to be based upon more recent\nsales information and thus forecast error should reduce. Such strategies can be\nenhanced by ordering components or material in advance of demand from low-cost\nsources and the assembling or manufacturing the final product locally to enable\ngreater responsiveness. This is the strategy adopted by Zara the successful Spanish\nfashion retailer. Other retailers in that sector such as the UK chain Next are bringing\nmore of their sourcing closer to their major markets in the UK and Ireland. Next now\nsource a significant number of products from Eastern Europe and Turkey rather than\nthe Far East (18).\nLowson (19) contrasted three European clothing retailers who used different sourcing\nstrategies; low cost, responsive and hybrid and found some fascinating differences in\ntheir financial performance. Whilst the low-cost sourcing strategy produced the\nhighest gross margin, it had the lowest return on investment. Conversely, the\ncompany with the responsive sourcing strategy had the lowest gross margin but the\nhighest return on investment. Table 4 below which anticipates our dicussion of the\n\u201clean\u201d and \u201cagile paradigm highlights the results of the Lowson study:-\nTake in Table 4\nTIME\nBase level demand\nVOLUME Surge demand\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 10\nThe Decline of an Icon\nAs an example of a business which has faced challenges in managing a global\npipeline in a volatile market, we need look no further than Marks and Spencer (M&S),\na well-known UK retailer. As summarised by Christopher and Peck (20) the company\nhad had a century of unbridled success, prior to their fall from grace. In the 1920s the\nbusiness adopted the then revolutionary policy of buying direct from manufacturers,\ninstead of through wholesalers. These unique supplier relationships gave the business\nan advantage that few of its rivals could match. By 1930 it was already recognisable\nas an established and effective practitioner of keiritsu with its supply base (21).\nHistorically M&S has designed most of its clothes in-house before putting the designs\nforward to favoured manufacturers with notoriously strict specifications regarding the\nfinished product. These manufacturers provided dedicated facilities for M&S who\nrequired suppliers to refrain from bidding for work from other clients. The close\npartnerships arrangements also relieved M&S of the need to allocate resources of its\nown to technological research and development activities. The outcome of servicing\nsuch a demanding client was a culture of continuous improvement within the\nsuppliers organisations and the loyalty of M&S through both good times and bad.\nBut this UK based supply strategy was inhibiting the development of the retail\nbusiness in Asia and the Pacific. Also M&S still officially encouraged its suppliers to\nsource in the UK, enabling it to maintain its \u2018buy-British\u2019 marketing stance. But their\nsuppliers were now struggling to remain price-competitive. Hence some had\ntherefore opted to supply at least a proportion of M&S\u2019s orders from overseas\nfacilities or buy-in virtually finished goods produced in low-cost manufacturing\ncentres such as China. So in order to comply with \u201chome\u201d sourcing requirements, the\ngarments were then shipped to the UK for finishing. Some of the consignment would\nthen need to be returned to the region of origin for sale! This round-trip lengthened\nthe time delay before goods appeared in the shops, and in some instances distribution\ncharges added as much as \u00a314 to an item that cost only \u00a34 to make.\nIn 1998\/99 failure to match supply with demand resulted in too much winter stock\ncosting M&S \u00a3150 million, of which \u00a390 million was lost from pre-Christmas sales,\nthe remaining \u00a360 million being the cost of clearing the excess stock. Some critics\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 11\npointed to overpricing and poor service as the reasons behind these falling sales.\nOthers claimed that customers were unhappy about a drop in quality of some\nproducts. Retail analysts were also talking of a decline in product quality, putting it\ndown to an increase in overseas sourcing. In 1983 the company had sourced 90% of\nits clothing in the UK, by 1994 this had slipped to 75% and then further downwards to\nan estimated 65% in 1998. To become price competitive, M&S was then urging its\nlargest suppliers to relocate production to low-wage economies. By January 2000\nM&S was indeed achieving its stated target by sourcing roughly 50% of its clothing\nand general merchandise outside the UK.\nWhen Price Deflation Impacts Demand\nHistorically M&S bought stock to cover over 100% of budgeted sales. Even now\nthey still make a forward commitment to 90% of the season\u2019s merchandise. So the\n10% uncommitted means there is far too little scope to respond when real demand is\nknown.\nWheatcroft (22) further infers that the company\u2019s problems result largely from a\nfailure by M&S to remedy core problems relating to supply chain design and\noperation. The symptoms are clearly visible via product-mix mismatch and non-\navailability of key goods, especially in shoes and clothing. Disastrous performance in\nthese two product ranges dragged down comparable sales for M&S as a whole by\n8.4% for the five weeks to November 4, 2000. Typically, poor availability cost the\nknitwear division around \u00a3M6 in lost sales, and similar problems in the footwear\ndivision cost around \u00a3M5. Even more surprising and worrying to the company is the\navailability problem continuing to surround lingerie supply, which has a relatively\nstable and predictable demand pattern.\nIn contrast the year 2000 performance of their UK competitor Next was outstanding.\nNext share price rose 42p to 650p following pre-tax rise in profits of 18%.\nFurthermore the Next CEO disputed claims that M&S were suffering from the\npolarisation of the high street clothing market into branded goods at one end and\ndiscounted goods at the other. His view was that \u201cPeoples\u2019 shopping habits are not\nchanging. You just have to be good at what you do.\u201d The Next strategy is to be\naspirational and affordable. Shopping on price deflation has come to an end.\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 12\nShoppers are opting for higher-priced items as consumers become more interested in\nquality and design.\u201d (22). The Next sales growth continues to be maintained.\nDesigning and managing the supply chain to deliver just what the customer wants yet\nagain appears to be the key to business success.\nAs noted by Perry et al (23) in Australia there is now a clear trend for suppliers to the\ndomestic market to focus on high value-added local-demand products that can\ncompete with offshore imports. Also the evolution of the information economy has\nhad a clear impact on the Australian textile, clothing and footwear industry, providing\na potential means of control over emerging global supply chains. Communication\nwith overseas supply chain partners was a challenge, calling for high levels of use of\nsecure Extranets, EDI transaction platforms, CAD\/CAM design and specification\ntransfer, email, facsimiles and the telephone. Perry et al (23) concluded that there is a\nneed for new organisational paradigms to cater for the increasingly complex supply\nchain. In leadership terms they found that the close-knit retail-to-upstream supplier\npartnerships that had been originally encouraged through government workshops and\nassistance programmes had been eroded somewhat through the retreat of the retailers\nback to their traditional power-based role of setting terms and standards for suppliers.\nRole of \u201cLean\u201d and \u201cAgile\u201d Paradigms in Modern Supply Chains\nThere has recently been some significant debate about the relative merits of the so-\ncalled \u201clean\u201d and \u201cagile\u201d approaches to supply chain management. There has been a\ntendency to suggest that these approaches are mutually exclusive and represent\nconflicting paradigms. In reality the two approaches can complement each other, and\nin many cases there is a requirement for a \u201chybrid\u201d lean\/agile strategy to be adopted,\n(24). Hence it is our contention that the issue is not \u201cLean versus Agile\u201d rather it is\nthe judicious selection and integration of appropriate aspects of these paradigms\nappropriate to the particular supply chain strategy.\nThe idea of \u201clean manufacturing\u201d was popularised by Womack, Jones and Roos, (25),\ntogether with the wider concepts of the \u201clean enterprise\u201d (26). The focus of the lean\napproach has essentially been on the elimination of waste or muda. The upsurge of\ninterest in lean manufacturing can be traced to the Toyota Production System (TPS)\nwith its focus on the reduction and elimination of waste. However, the origins of lean\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 13\nmanufacture are certainly visible in Spitfire aircraft production in the UK in World\nWar II, and Keiretsu date back to the USA automotive industry in 1915.\nACTIVITY LEVEL CHARACTERISTICS OF AGILE ORGANISATION\n1.

A key\ncharacteristic of an agile organisation is flexibility. Initially it was thought that the\nroute to manufacturing flexibility was though automation to enable rapid changeovers\n(i.e. reduced set-up times) and thus enable a greater responsiveness to changes in\nproduct mix or volume. Later this idea of manufacturing flexibility was extended into\nthe wider business context and the concept of agility as a supply chain philosophy was\nborn. Table 5 summarises this philosophy along six dimensions : marketing;\nproduction; design; organisation; management; and people.\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 14\nAgile\nSupply\nLean Supply\nMarket Qualifiers Market Winners\nFig. 3\nMarket Winners \u2013 Market Qualifiers Matrix for Agile Versus Lean Supply\nSource: Mason-Jones, Naylor, and Towill (7)\nIdeally, organisations would wish to benefit from the advantages of being both lean\nand agile \u2013 they should not be viewed as mutually exclusive options. On the contrary,\nas we shall demonstrate, we may well find the lean and agile paradigms operating at\ndifferent times but in the same place, or operating at the same time in different places\nwithin a supply chain. Furthermore, application of the Market Winners\/Market\nQualifiers Framework suggests that we may well need to operate with the leanest\nagile system or the most responsive lean system (28). This is because as shown in\nFig. 3 availability is the market winner in agile supply, whereas cost is the market\nwinner in lean supply but with cost and availability as market qualifiers respectively.\nA Taxonomy for Pipeline Selection\nIt is clear that there can be a number of different pipelines which may be chosen to\nsatisfy customer demand but that such pipelines must be selected to match the\nbusiness strategy of the supply chain. The Marks and Spencer example demonstrates\nthat pipelines must be carefully matched to market requirements. It is equally clear\nthat in the current business environment that quite different pipelines may function\nalongside one another, each needing appropriate operating and management skills. It\nis also likely that products may well require different kinds of pipeline according to\ntheir position within the product life cycle.\n1. Quality\n2. Cost\n3. Lead Time\n1. Service Level\n1. Cost\n1. Quality\n2. Lead Time\n3. Service Level\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 15\nSo pipelines are not fixed for all times. What is needed is continuous assessment of\nthe product range and market characteristics so that changing scenarios may be\nidentified. Against these product\/market characteristics will be a number of\nalternative options for pipeline design, dependent upon supply lead-times.\nA number of classification schemes have been proposed in the literature (see for\nexample Childerhouse (29) to guide the choice of supply chain strategy. We are\nsuggesting a simple three dimensional classification appropriate for global supply\nchains. The variables and their binary gradation are:\n\uf0b7 Products (either standard or special)\n\uf0b7 Demand (either stable or volatile)\n\uf0b7 Lead Times (either short or long)\nFigure 4 shows the theoretical combinations of product, demand and lead-times. In\npractice some of these combinations are either unlikely to be encountered or are non-\nviable situations. Where demand is stable it will generally be easier to forecast and\nhence inventory-based solutions may be appropriate, particularly where lead-times are\nlong. However, by definition when demand is volatile, forecast-based management\nbecomes untenable. Hence the need in those situations for agile supply chain\nstrategies. Agility implies end-to-end time compression or postponement of final\nproduct configuration.\nA further element to influence the choice of supply chain strategy is the specific\n\u2018market winner\u2019 criterion. Where cost is the primary market winner, then the\nemphasis must be upon efficiency which will imply lean strategies. However, the\nreality is that lean strategies will only be viable where demand is stable and the\nproducts are standard. Where availability is the market winner then the emphasis will\ninevitably veer towards agile strategies.\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 16\nFigure 4 : A Taxonomy of Supply Chains\nAn Adaptive Global Supply Chain\nFrom the foregoing it is now clear that in the 21st century global supply chain\nstrategies must correctly match the pipeline to the requirements of the marketplace.\nIn particular there is a need to enable lean production to meet those situations where\ncost is the market winner. Additionally and concurrently we must enable agile\nproduction to counter those situations where availability is the market winner.\nFurthermore the adaptive supply chain must have the capability of switching pipelines\nas demanded by the requirements of the marketplace. The adaptive supply chain is\ntherefore able to simultaneously compete on price (where required) and on\navailability (where required).\nAn example of such an adaptive supply chain already operating in the apparel\nindustry is the Griffin Manufacturing Co (30). Their strategy combines a lean\npipeline offshore (in Honduras) and an agile pipeline in the USA. Based on current\ntrends there is an expectancy that in the long-term offshore production will be about\n80% of the total volume. The remaining 20% is made in the USA.\nThe Griffin strategy was based on the following observations:\nVolatile Stable\nSpecial\nStandard\nDemand\nProduct\nLong\nlead\ntime\n1.\n2.\nShort\nlead\ntime\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\nLong\nlead\ntime\nLong\nlead\ntime\nLong\nlead\ntimeShort\nlead\ntime\nShort\nlead\ntime\nShort\nlead\ntime\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 17\n\uf0b7 A significant fraction of orders requires \u201cinstant\u201d response\n\uf0b7 Forecasting accuracy is quite poor for a significant percentage of styles\n\uf0b7 Excess inventory is very expensive\nThe resulting Griffin mix of process choice and order wining criteria are shown in\nTable 6.\nBusiness Requirement Process Choice Order Winning Criteria\nNew Product Introductions Jobbing Fast Response,\nSpecification\nVolume Orders Large Batch Price\nFill-in Orders Small Batch Fast Response\nTable 6\nMix Process Choice and Order Winning Criteria Targeted by Griffin Business\nStrategy\n(Source; Stratton and Warburton (30))\nA typical measure of forecasting accuracy is that 70% of the styles have a prediction\nwithin 25% of sales. For those products with the most uncertain forecasts, it is\nreasonable to assign a lower percentage to offshore production and reserve capacity at\nan agile manufacturer. On the other hand, for basic styles that sell throughout the\nyear, a much higher percentage of lean (offshore) production can be assigned. Griffin\nestablished a clear financial case that for their product range and typical forecast\naccuracies, the profit margins for a mixed offshore-onshore production strategy are\ncompetitive with the offshore only case. But with the mixed strategy, margins\nimprove and sales increase because the agile manufacturer can take advantage of the\nearly sales information to produce more of the styles the customers are actually\ndemanding. Table 7 illustrates the Griffin viewpoint and summarises their considered\nconsequences of using alternative pipelines to match and meet customer demand.\nTake in table 7\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 18\nThere are a number of challenges associated with the mixed (adaptive pipeline)\nstrategy such as sharing the pain between retailer and manufacturer. In one sense\nwhat is required of the retailer using the adaptive supply chain is a much more\nchallenging approach. Rather than ordering to forecast, the retailer has to analyse\nforecasts. It is their remit to decide on offshore (lean) production commitments, and\nUSA (agile) capacity reservation. Hence retailers must share their sales data and\nwork continuously with manufacturers to get the exact inventory they need. When\nsales increase, everyone will be satisfied. The retailer sells more products with fewer\nmarkdowns, resulting in less excess inventory. Also, the manufacturer can make\nminor adjustments (e.g. fill in sizes) to further tailor the inventory to the actual\ndemand. Finally, there is less profit leakage via \u201ccannibalisation\u201d due to sales\nmarkdowns. Cannibalisation is the phenomenon whereby the customer buys two\ncheaper garments now, thus avoiding a full price purchase in the future.\nThe way that Griffin Manufacturing Co. have engineered and exploited the adaptive\nsupply chain is shown in matrix format in Fig. 5. Along with the implied changes in\noperations a significant evolution in Griffin\u2019s management philosophy also occurred.\nInitially the USA factory used to view themselves as in competition with the\nHonduras factory, and resented every unit that went abroad as lost internal business.\nEventually they came to realise that they could never compete on price alone, but did\nhave an essential legitimate and complimentary cost-effective role in supplying the\nretailer. The days of large, stable production runs for the US plant have disappeared.\nBut the reality is that the plant can survive by making small runs of complex styles,\nand producing them quickly. As shown in Fig. 5, the USA facility also \u201ctops-up\u201d\nhigh volume products as required to meet extreme demands. These two agile\npipelines account for some 20% of the total volume. The Griffin strategy has thus\nprotected US jobs by identifying the right agile home-based niches to complement\nlean Honduras manufacture.\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 19\nDemand\nProduct\nVolatile Stable\nSpecial\nStandard\nFig. 5.\nSummary of the Griffin Manufacturing Company Pipeline Product Matrix for\nLean and Agile Supply\n(Source: Authors based on Stratton & Warburton (30))\nGlobal Pipeline Taxonomies at Work\nHow does the Griffin Manufacturing Co\u2019s. pragmatic solution to matching\ncombinations of USA and Honduras apparel production align with the proposed\npipeline taxonomy?

The biggest need is\nundoubtedly to move away from the \u201cOne Size Fits All\u201d scenario. At the same time\nthere is little point in selecting a taxonomy yielding multiple possible pipelines if the\nend result means that only a handful of solutions are eventually selected. This\n\u201cfiltering\u201d may be on the basis of management preference for specific pipelines, or on\nthe base of a cost-effectiveness model. We think a binary classification system has a\nnumber of advantages. Firstly, analysts have to make a firm judgement in such a\nsituation \u2013 they cannot sit on the fence. Secondly, the use of binary codes tends to\navoid regression to the mean ~ \u201cseeking to satisfy everyone, but pleasing no one\u201d.\nThere is little point in using a taxonomy which does not lead to supply chain\nmanagers being offered real choices in a language they understand. Our proposed\nclassification system based on Lead Times (Short\/Long); Demand Predictability\n(Stable\/Volatile) and Product Type (Standard\/Special) meets this requirement.\nConclusions\nPresent day marketplaces are volatile and at the same time extremely price sensitive.\nAchieving success in this environment requires a good knowledge of pipeline\nrequirements from marketing back to materials manufacturers. Within supply chains\nit is possible to identify some operations which are \u201clean\u201d (without fat) and some\noperations which are \u201cagile\u201d (nimble). The aim is to select and marry together the\nparticular combinations of lean\/agile operations so as to match individual pipelines to\nmarket needs.\nIn the paper we have developed a taxonomy suitable for this purpose. It is based on\ndemand (predictable\/volatile), product (standard\/special) and supply lead times\n(long\/short). This is seen to generate three feasible pipeline designs, all of which are\napplicable within the global apparel supply chain framework. Generally the preferred\nsolution will be that predictable demand for standard items will be met via a lean\npipeline probably fed from overseas manufacturers. Volatile demand for special\nitems will then be met via an agile pipeline probably fed from home manufacturers.\nA third pipeline design is for quick response to top-up standard products for which\nthere is an unexpected demand for specific colours, sizes, volume etc.\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 21\nReferences\n(1) Christopher, Martin, \u201cLogistics and Supply Chain Management : Strategies\nfor Reducing Costs and Improving Services\u201d Pitman Publishing, London,\n1992.\n(2) McCullen, Peter and Denis R.
