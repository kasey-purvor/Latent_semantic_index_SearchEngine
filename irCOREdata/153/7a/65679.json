This two-part study explored the behaviour and physiology of twin \ninfants sleeping separately and together.  \nDesign, setting and participants: In part-one 10 twin infant pairs between 1 and 3 \nmonths of age were videoed sleeping together at home in head-to-head and side-\nby-side configurations. In part-two 14 twin pairs under 3 months of age participated in \na 2-condition trial with behavioural and physiological monitoring while sleeping \ntogether and apart in the sleep lab.  \nFindings: In Part One Sleep variables were unaffected by co-bedding configuration. \nBabies positioned side-by-side were observed to occasionally impinge on, but not \nobstruct, one another\u2019s airways with an arm across the other\u2019s face.  In Part Two no \ndifference was found in their duration of sleep, frequency of waking, core \ntemperature, or head covering in the two conditions; co-bedded twins exhibited \nmore synchronous sleep states.  \nConclusions: The co-bedding of term twin infants less than 3 months of age does not \nappear to be associated with the negative attributes that concern some parents, \nand there may be advantages in terms of sleep synchrony and ease of care.  These \nresults can be used by health professionals in formulating guidance for parents of \ntwins. \n \nIntroduction \nParents may seek the guidance of health professionals regarding the pros and cons \nof sleeping arrangements for healthy twin infants, but there are currently few \npublished data on which advice can be based (Holditch-Davis et al. 1999).  With the \nincreasing trend in multiple births (Beck 2002; MBF 2005) the demand for information \nconcerning the care of multiples will continue to increase (Bowers 1998). We have \npreviously ascertained that both co-bedding and separate sleeping are commonly \nused arrangements for twin infants up to three months of age, with separate sleeping \ngaining parental popularity as infants grow; in the absence of guidance from health \nprofessionals parents of twins advance various explanations for their practices (Ball \n2006). Concerns that babies would disturb one another\u2019s sleep, could overheat, or \nsquash each other if co-bedded caused some parents to sleep their twins separately. \nParents favouring co-bedding believed their infants preferred being together, slept \nbetter, had more synchronous sleep, and proved easier to care for (Ball 2006). \nDespite an extensive review of nursing and paediatric literature (via bibliographic \ndatabases including Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science) no studies could be \nfound to provide empirical support or refutation for any of these beliefs, although \nanecdotal evidence and theoretical perspectives supporting various positions were \nfound (e.g. Hayward 2003; Gromada 1991). \n \nThe presumed benefits of co-bedding are based upon the argument that twins have \nthe capacity to support one another via co-regulation because of their common \nintrauterine experiences (Nyqvist and Lutes, 1998); \u201cTwins can be more self-sustaining \nand self-contained because of their twin partner\u201d (Rothbart 1994 quoted in \nDellaPorta et al 1998). Published observations of co-bedded pre-term twins describe \nneonates moving close together, touching, holding, hugging, rooting on and sucking \none another, and cite synchronous wakeful periods and reduced need for ambient \ntemperature support as benefits of this care-strategy (Nyqvist and Lutes 1998, Lutes \n 4\n1996, Bingham 1997).  Such co-regulatory effects of twin infants upon one another \nmight be expected given the synchronous behaviour and physiological patterns \nidentified between foetuses in twin gestations (e.g. Gallagher et al. 1992).  Recent \nstudies of  the sleep patterns of preterm infants reported no adverse events for infants \nin co-bedded arrangements, and that infants exhibited a significant reduction in \ncentral apnoea events compared to the period prior to co-bedding (Touch et al \n2002). Concerns surrounding co-bedding of term twin infants reflect some of the \nissues raised in SIDS reduction guidelines, such as suffocation and overheating (DoH \n2004). \n \nPublications concerning the benefits of co-bedding for pre-term twins have sparked \ninterest in the issue of twin infant sleeping arrangements generally, but as yet no data \nhave been published regarding the effects of sleeping arrangement on the \nbehaviour or physiology of healthy term twin infants, and health professionals have no \nclear evidence on which to base advice for parents. Both hospital and community \nmidwives have the opportunity to influence parent\u2019s decisions regarding sleeping \narrangements in the initial weeks of their infants\u2019 lives (Ball 2006) and may be asked \nby parents about the pros and cons of co-bedding; midwives may therefore need to \nbe familiar with the implications of these arrangements in the post-neonatal period. \nThis study aimed to examine alleged pros and cons of co-bedded and separate \nsleeping arrangements for healthy term-delivered twins, and to ascertain whether \nobjectively-measured pros and cons for separate and together sleeping \narrangements could be identified with regard to disturbance, overheating, \ncompression, synchrony and ease-of-care. \n \n 5\nMethods \nThe study, conducted between December 2001 and December 2002, involved two \nphases: \n1. video monitoring of the sleep behaviour of normally co-bedded infants in their \nhome environment; \n2. behavioural and physiological monitoring of twin infants sleeping together \nand apart in a sleep lab environment. \nThe first phase of the study was descriptive, designed to obtain data on the normal \nbehaviour of co-bedded twin infants in their home environment.  The second phase \nwas experimental, involving the behavioural and physiological monitoring of twin \ndyads sleeping together and apart in the Durham University Parent-Infant Sleep Lab.  \nPrior to commencing recruitment of participants we sought and received approval \nfrom local and multi-regional NHS ethics committees for both phases of the study. \n \nA convenience sample of families with twin infants was recruited via the Twin and \nMultiple Birth Association (Tamba), local newspapers, posters in hospital wards, and \nlocal midwives. Inclusion criteria specified healthy infants of normal gestation, \nbetween two and three months of age, located within travelling distance of the \nSleep Lab, and with parents willing to a) allow us to video their twin infants in their \nhome for phase-one; and\/or b) visit the Sleep Lab with their infants for behavioural \nand physiological monitoring for phase-two.  Eligible volunteers received Participant \nInformation documents and discussed the study with a researcher.  Parents willing to \nparticipate signed a consent form and completed a set of nightly sleep logs for their \nbabies over a 1 week period. Background demographic data and information \nregarding night-time infant care practices and normal sleeping arrangements were \ncollected via telephone or face-to-face interview.   \n \n 6\nPart-one: In-home study \nResearch staff visited the families\u2019 homes and installed video equipment at the \ninfants\u2019 normal sleep location. The equipment comprised a small video camcorder \nconnected to a long play video-recorder housed in an attach\u00e9 case. The camera \nwas mounted on a 2 metre tripod and positioned directly over the infants\u2019 cot\/Moses \nbasket to obtain a \u2018bird\u2019s eye\u2019 view. The camcorder\u2019s \u2018night-shot\u2019 facility permitted \nfilming in complete darkness. A continuous date and time signal was overlaid onto \nthe videotape. Parents were asked to care for their infants as normal,  provided with \ninstructions to begin recording (using a remote control) once their infants were \nplaced in the cot for the night, and asked to allow the tape to record unimpeded \nuntil the infants were removed from the cot in the morning, or the 8-hour tape \nelapsed, whichever was sooner. Parents were shown how to use the remote control \nto halt the recording at any point if they felt it was necessary. Babies were filmed for \ntwo consecutive nights, the 1st serving as a habituation night (to minimise the effect of \nthe camera on behaviour) and the 2nd night being the monitoring night from which \ndata were analysed (Agnew et al 1966). Following filming researchers returned to the \nhome to dismantle the equipment and conduct a debriefing interview.  Parents were \noffered the opportunity to watch both tapes before giving final consent for them to \nbe used in the study.  \n \nPart-two: Sleep-lab trial \nPart-two involved a two-condition trial, using infants as their own controls, in co-\nbedded and separate sleeping configurations.  Parents and infants attended the \nSleep Lab for 3 nights; on the first (habituation) night babies slept in their normal \nconfiguration (Agnew et al 1966); on the two test nights babies slept together or \napart in identical standard-sized cots with identical bedding, and controlled room \ntemperature. Test night order was determined randomly via a coin toss performed in \nthe parents\u2019 presence. When sleeping apart the infants\u2019 cots were positioned side-by-\n 7\nside with walking space between them for parental access. When parents had \nprepared their infants to be dressed in their nightclothes a researcher attached \nphysiological monitors to both infants (toe-wrap pulse oximeter, thoracic and \nabdominal respi-bands, and a flexible rectal thermometer probe).  The monitor wires, \nsecured into a single bundle, connected to data-boxes positioned next to each cot. \nQuick release cables from the data-boxes facilitated movement of the infants from \nthe cot(s).  Behavioural monitoring utilised a ceiling-mounted camera and infra-red \nlighting positioned over the infants\u2019 cot(s). The direction and zoom of the camera was \nmanipulated remotely from the adjacent monitoring room and the live camera feed \nwas displayed on-screen. Physiological signals from the data-boxes were \ndownloaded to Winvisi\u00ae software in the monitoring room and overlaid onto the video \nimage. Both images and signals were recorded to videotape. Once infants were \npositioned in their designated sleep location the video and physiological monitoring \nrecordings commenced. Continuous 8-hour recordings were made for each night \nwith a researcher remaining in the monitoring room to ensure the integrity of the data \nrecorded (re-attach probes etc), and to intervene should a potentially risky situation \noccur. Prior to the start of the study an intervention policy for researchers conducting \novernight monitoring was agreed with a local consultant paediatrician. Parents slept \nin the same room as the infants, but were off camera unless they approached the \ncot(s). In the morning physiological monitors were removed from the babies by the \nparents who also participated in a de-briefing interview concerning the preceding \nnight.  \n \nGratuity \nA gratuity of \u00a310 per night of monitoring was given to each family (in the form of gift-\nvouchers) upon completion of each part of the study. Some parents who travelled \nlong distances to bring their infants to the sleep lab requested travel expenses instead \nof gift-vouchers and these requests were honoured. \n 8\n Behavioural data \nVideo-observations were coded to spreadsheets using a purpose-designed \nbehavioural taxonomy (available from the author). Modified duration scores for state \nbehaviours and locations were calculated from scan samples every 3 minutes. Event \nbehaviours were recorded continuously and absolute frequencies and rates \ncomputed. Presence\/absence data for movement by each infant were recorded \nusing 30 second intervals across the entire night.  In part-one sleep states were \nassigned using behavioural assessment only. Inter and intra-observer reliability scores \n(kappa coefficients) were calculated to ensure data-integrity. Descriptive and \ncomparative analyses of the behavioural data were conducted using SPSS\u00ae \n(Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) software.  \n \nPhysiological data \nIn part-two physiological data were downloaded from Winvisi\u00ae to spreadsheets and \naligned with behavioural data. Temperature and oxygen saturation was averaged \nover 1-minute blocks. Respiration traces were used in conjunction with behavioural \nassessment to determine infants\u2019 predominant sleep state for each of the 3-minute \nblocks.  \n \nResults \nPart-one: In-home study \nNine pairs of DZ twins, and one pair of MZ twins, were behaviourally monitored \nsleeping together at home. Four DZ pairs slept head-to-head, while 5 DZ pairs and the \nMZ pair slept side by side. The parents who participated in part-one had a household \nincome of twice the national average for 2001, were well educated, and in their \nearly thirties (Table 1). Infants were born at 35-weeks gestation or later, and were 6 to \n14 weeks old at the time of study.   \n 9\n Table 1: Sample characteristics for phase one and two \nInfant Characteristics In-home Study Sleep Lab Trial \nNo. twin pairs 10 14 \nMean infant age 9.72 wks (68 days) 10.71 wks (75 days) \nMean gestation 37.3 wks (261 days) 36.8  weeks (258 days)* \nZygosity 9DZ: 1MZ 12DZ: 2MZ \nMean birth weight 2.56kg 2.61kg \nFeeding method 3 mixed \n6 formula \n1 breastmilk \n5 mixed  \n8 formula  \n1 breastmilk  \nParent Characteristics   \nMean maternal age 33 33  \nMean paternal age 35 36  \nMarital status 100% married\/cohabiting 100% married\/cohabiting \nParity 2.5 3.07  \nHome ownership 100% homeowners 100% homeowners \nMean age mother left education  20.2 years 19.7 years \nMean age father left education 20.1 years 19.6 years \nMean total income** \u00a337,920 \u00a338,000 \n \n*We did not, as a rule, recruit twin infants who were born extremely prematurely (pre-35 \nweeks gestation), however due to the importance of obtaining data on MZ twins we included \none MZ twin pair born at 32 weeks gestation. \n**The average household income for a couple with children in UK in 2001 was \u00a318,876 \n(ESRC 2005) \n \nThe two co-bedding configurations (side-by-side and head-to-head) are described \nand compared. The mean simultaneous sleep duration (SSD), mean waking \n 10\nfrequency, and mean percentage of night in REM and quiet sleep for all twin pairs, \nand by sleep configuration are shown in Table 2.

Infants co-bedded side-by-side spent more time \noriented towards one another than facing away from their co-twin (mean duration \ntowards twin = 65.4% of night, mean duration away = 27% of night). Infants positioned \nhead-to-head were unable to face one another. Co-bedded infants in both \n 11\nconfigurations spent two-thirds to three-quarters of the night touching one another, \nwith no significant difference in the percentage duration in contact. \n \nWe examined the duration of head-covering by bed-covers, and airway covering by \nbed-covers and co-twin\u2019s body. No head-covering occurred for any of the twin pairs. \nAirway covering was observed occasionally, resulting either from swaddling, or (in the \ncase of side-by-side co-bedding) one infant\u2019s arm resting across the co-twin\u2019s face. \nInfants positioned side-by-side experienced airway covering for a mean duration of \n3.57% of the night (14.3 minutes), while head-to-head infants experienced airway \ncovering for a mean duration of 1.44% of the night (5.5 minutes). The difference \nbetween the two configurations was not significant, with overlapping 95% \nconfidence intervals. None of the side-by-side infants were physically compressed or \n\u2018rolled-on\u2019 by a co-twin. The results of the in-home observational study identified no \naspects of infant sleep behaviour that differed significantly between the two co-\nbedding configurations. We therefore were able to eliminate co-bedding \nconfiguration as a variable from the sleep lab trial. \n \nSleep-lab trial \nTwelve pairs of DZ and 2 pairs of MZ twin infants under the age of 3 months were \nbehaviourally and physiologically monitored over a 3 night period.  Parents were \nrecruited to this portion of the study via local advertising (7 families) and through \nTamba (7 families).  Sample characteristics are summarised in Table 1. Eight of the \ntwin pairs normally slept together (same cot) at home (designated as routinely \ntogether) while six slept in separate cots or Moses baskets (designated as routinely \nseparate). All of those sleeping in Moses baskets did so in their parents\u2019 room, as did \nall but one of the pairs who shared a cot. The results from part-two compare infant \nbehaviour, physiology and sleep characteristics for twins sleeping together and apart \nand test a priori hypotheses generated by parental interviews in a previous study (Ball \n 12\n2006). Twin pairs served as their own controls in this 2-condition trial. The test nights are \ndesignated \u2018separate night\u2019 and \u2018together night\u2019. No situation observed on any test \nnight met the pre-defined criteria for intervention therefore infants were simply \nmonitored throughout. \n \nSleeping and waking \nSleep duration was compared on together nights and separate nights for all infants, \nand partitioned by routine sleep condition (routinely together or routinely separate). \nNo significant differences were found in the overall amount of total, REM or quiet \nsleep achieved by infants in both the co-bedded and separate sleeping \narrangements. Infants spent greater proportions of sleep time in REM when sleeping in \ntheir usual condition than in the alternate (Table 3), and both sets of infants obtained \nmore quiet sleep on the separate night; none of these differences was statistically \nsignificance, and 95% confidence intervals were similar on both nights and for both \nroutine conditions. There was no significant difference in waking frequency in the two \nconditions (Table 4). \n \n 13\nTable 3: Sleep characteristics of infants on co-bedded (together) and separate nights \n All infants \n(n=14) \nRoutinely-\nseparate \ninfants \n(n=6) \nRoutinely-\ntogether \ninfants \n(n=8) \nMean % total sleep duration on together-\nnight (95% confidence interval) \n                                           \nMean % total sleep duration on separate-\nnight (95% confidence interval) \n77.50 \n(+\/-6.10) \n \n79.49 \n(+\/-6.19) \n74.07 \n(+\/-11.41) \n \n76.2 \n(+\/-11.86) \n80.07 \n(+\/-6.53) \n \n81.8 \n(+\/-6.43) \n \nMean % REM on together-night \n(95% confidence interval) \n     \nMean % REM on separate-night \n(95% confidence interval) \n \n45.53 \n(+\/-4.50) \n \n44.28 \n(+\/-4.65) \n \n43.0 \n(+\/-9.62) \n \n47.09 \n(+\/-5.34) \n \n47.40 \n(+\/-3.41) \n \n42.17 \n(+\/-7.02) \n \nMean % QS on together-night \n(95% confidence interval) \n                                           \nMean % QS on separate-night \n(95% confidence interval) \n \n20.62 \n(+\/-3.69) \n \n22.90 \n(+\/-4.36) \n \n20.16 \n(+\/-7.94) \n \n21.30 \n(+\/-8.27) \n \n20.96 \n(+\/-3.20) \n \n24.10 \n(+\/-4.83) \n \nNo significant differences were found between together and separate nights or routinely-\nseparate and routinely-together infants. \n 14\n Table 4: Waking on co-bedded (together) and separate nights \n Together-night Separate-night  \n \nMean waking frequency, all infants (n=14) \n(95% confidence interval) \n \n2.71  \n(+\/-0.42) \n \n2.36 \n(+\/-0.44) \n \n \nMean for routinely-together infants (n=8) \n(95% confidence interval) \n \n2.64 \n(+\/-0.62) \n \n2.25 \n(+\/-0.64) \n \n \nMean for routinely-separate infants (n=6) \n(95% confidence interval) \n \n2.80 \n(+\/-0.61) \n \n2.50 \n(+\/-0.62) \n \n \nSleep position \nInfants overwhelmingly slept supine on both nights. One pair spent 22.5% and 26% \nrespectively of the separate-night sleeping in a lateral position having been placed in \nthe cot by their parents with a wedge of bedding behind their backs. On the \ntogether-night they again had bedding wedged behind their backs, however this \ntime it was unsuccessful. Nevertheless one of these infants self-positioned onto his side \nfor 18% of the night.  \n \nOrientation, proximity, and movement \nInfants positioned side-by-side spent 47% of the together-night oriented towards their \nco-twin compared with 29% of separate-night when sleeping side-by-side in separate \ncots.  Routinely-together infants spent 35.3% of the separate-night oriented in the \ndirection of their co-twin compared with 20% for routinely-separate infants \u2013 a \ndifference that just reached significance (p=0.045). Routinely-together infants spent a \ngreater proportion of the together-night physically touching one another than did the \nroutinely-separate infants (35% vs 15%), but the wide range of variation for routinely-\n 15\ntogether infants (0% to 73%) associated with their arrangement in the cot meant that \nthe difference was not statistically significant and confidence intervals were broad. \n \nThe proportion of 30-second epochs in which movement was observed was \ncompared across the two conditions. Infants moved, on average, during 31% of \nepochs on the together-night and 30% on the separate-night. Movement by both \ninfants occurred during a mean of 13% of epochs on together-night and 10% on the \nseparate-night. There were no significant differences found between test-night sleep \nconditions. Movements predominantly involved limb and head movement. In 56 \nbaby-nights of observation only 1 infant independently altered their location \u2013 from \nfoot to middle of the cot on the separate-night. \n \nTemperature \nOne twin-pair received immunisations on the day preceding a sleep lab night, and \ntheir temperature data were therefore excluded from analysis due to artificial \nelevation. We found no difference in the core temperature of infants on the together-\nnight and separate-night (Table 5). The mean peak difference between the two \nconditions was 0.015oC; the mean difference in nadir was -0.015oC. Temperature \ntrajectory across the night was plotted graphically for all infants and none of the twin \npairs exhibited temperature synchrony, regardless of condition or degree of contact.  \n \n 16\nTable 5: Core temperature extremes on test nights (n=14) \n \n Together-night Separate-night  \n \nMean Peak \n(95% confidence interval) \n \n37.33 oC \n(+\/-0.13) \n \n37.28 oC \n(+\/-0.09) \n \n \nMean Nadir \n(95% confidence interval) \n \n36.47 oC \n(+\/-0.17) \n \n36.46 oC \n(+\/-0.10) \n \n \nCompression, airway covering and head covering \nOverlaying or body compression of one twin by another was not observed. In two \ncases one twin rested a limb (arm) across the co-twin\u2019s face on the together-night. \nThese incidents occurred when babies were located side-by-side in close proximity. \nNeither incident lasted longer than 10 minutes, nor was an infant\u2019s mouth or nose \ncompletely obstructed.  One instance was associated with slightly lowered oxygen \nsaturation (but not lowered sufficiently to the point where intervention was required), \nfollowed by arousal and movement by the affected infant. \n   \nFace covering by bedding occurred for one pair only, and occurred in both test \nconditions as a result of swaddling. On the together-night the infants\u2019 external airways \nwere entirely covered for 70% and 74% of the night respectively compared with 50% \nand 91% on the separate-night (Figure 1). \n \n 17\nFigure 1: Swaddling covering infants\u2019 airways on together (co-bedded) night \n \n \nThe infant who spent 91% of the separate-night with airways covered was the only \nbaby observed to experience whole head covering (15.6% of SN) -- a consequence \nof his struggle to free himself from the blankets that covered his mouth and nose \nwhen swaddled. A 30 minute portion of REM sleep with the whole head covered was \ncompared to a previous 30 minute portion of REM sleep with the head uncovered. \nThe mean core temperature for the head-covered period was 36.94oC compared to \n36.5oC when uncovered (Wilcoxon, z=-2.677, p=0.007). \n \nSleep and feeding synchrony  \nOverall sleep state (awake, REM, quiet and indeterminate) was synchronised for a \nsignificantly greater proportion of together-nights (46.0%) than separate-nights (34.6%) \nas shown in Figure 2. Partitioning by routine condition revealed that although \nroutinely-separate infants demonstrated greater synchrony on the together-night \nthan the separate-night, it was only for routinely-together infants that sleep synchrony \nwas significantly greater (Figure 2). No difference was found in the synchrony of \nfeeding bouts on the two test nights.   \n 18\nFigure 2: Sleep synchrony \n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nAll RT RS\nPe\nrc\nen\nt\nTN SN\n \n \nAll infants on together-night (TN) vs separate-night (SN), p=0.017; Routinely-together (RT) \ninfants on TN vs SN, p=0.034.

RS=Routinely-separate \ninfants. \n \nDiscussion \nIn a previous report on the night-time care of newborn twins we described parents\u2019 \nreasons for sleeping their twin infants together or apart (Ball 2006). This subsequent \nstudy provides empirical data with which to evaluate these beliefs and assumptions. \nExplanations for sleeping twins separately involved: 1) infants sharing a cot disturb \none another; 2) infants sharing a cot may overheat; 3) infants sharing a cot may \nsuffocate one another.  Explanations for sleeping twins together involved: 4) infants \nsharing a cot sleep better; 5) infants sharing a cot exhibit synchronised sleep patterns; \n6) infants prefer to share a cot; 7) infants sharing a cot are easier to care for. These \nassertions are evaluated below in light of the data reported here.  \n \nWe compared infants\u2019 at-home sleep behaviour in side-by-side and head-to-head \nsleeping arrangements and discovered no differences: infants slept for equivalent \ndurations, and exhibiting similar proportions of visually determined REM and quiet \n 19\nsleep in both configurations.  We found no evidence that either side-by-side or head-\nto-head co-bedding was associated with potential suffocation or compression. Short \nperiods of partial airway covering resulted both from swaddling, and from the limb of \none twin impinging on the nose or mouth of the other. No complete airway covering \nwas observed and no infants struggled to breathe or free themselves, however all \ninfants in the study were of similar size and body-weight. The issue of compression by \na co-twin could be of greater concern should there be a mismatch in size between \nthe infants.  \n \nIn the sleep lab trial none of the suggested reasons against co-bedding were \nsupported by the data, however we found some evidence to support reasons that \nfavoured co-bedding. We found no support for reasons 1 or 4 with no difference in \nthe duration of overall sleep, waking frequency, or the duration of sleep components, \nfor the infants in the two conditions.  Furthermore the observation of several infants \nremaining asleep next to a screaming co-twin further refutes explanation 1 and \nsuggests habituation. Co-bedded twins did exhibit synchronous sleep states \n(explanation 5) with a significantly greater proportion of the night spent in \nsynchronous states when co-bedded than when apart. For the twins who normally \nshared a cot this effect was particularly pronounced, with evidence that they lost \ntheir synchronous patterning on the night they slept separately. For the normally \nsolitary sleeping twins the co-bedded night resulted in an increase in synchrony, but \nnot to the point of statistical significance. This reinforces the notion that the synchrony \nobserved in utero (Gallagher e al., 1992; Sherer et al 1990) and in premature twins \n(e.g. Hayward 2003) persists into infancy if close proximity is maintained. The \norientation bias observed among normally co-bedded twins, even when sleeping \napart, suggests that babies who normally sleep together are attuned to one \nanother\u2019s presence in a way that is not exhibited by separately sleeping infants. This \npreferential orientation, plus the high proportion of the night that some co-bedded \n 20\npairs spent in close physical contact, combined with the reduction in synchrony when \nseparated, may explain parents\u2019 perceptions that their infants prefer sleeping \ntogether (explanation 6), and that co-bedded infants are easier to care for. Our \nprevious finding that co-bedded infants are more likely to remain in their parents\u2019 \nroom for longer also supports ease of care, particularly for breastfeeding mothers (Ball \n2006). \n \nNo support was found for the suggestion that healthy co-bedded twins may overheat \nwhen sleeping in close proximity; infant core temperatures showed no difference in \nmaximum peak or minimum post-sleep fall in the two sleep conditions. The issue of \nwhether heat loss may be compromised in a situation where one or both infants are \nexperiencing pyrexia and are co-bedded remains to be investigated. As with the in-\nhome study, the sleep lab trial found no evidence in support of co-twin compression \nor potential asphyxia during co-bedded nights. Despite the fact that on occasion \none twin\u2019s limb rested across a sibling\u2019s face this resulted in only a minor fall in oxygen \nsaturation of the affected infant who was able to free himself easily.  The use of \nswaddling in both the in-home and lab-trial phases of this study was found to be \nassociated with airway covering, and in one instance with head covering that \nresulted in increased core temperature (although the increase did not rise above \nnormal body temperature). The issue of infant swaddling is not intrinsically related to \nthe issue of sleeping arrangements for infant twins, and was a minority practice both \nin the home and the lab. As there was some suggestion in previous research that \nparents may be using swaddling as a means to restrain co-bedded infants to prevent \ndisturbance (Ball 2006), and as disturbance by a co-twin has been found here to be \nminor, there is little argument to support swaddling in this situation.  \n \nIt should be remembered that this was a small-scale study, and the 95% confidence \nintervals are relatively broad. Lack of differences between the co-bedded and \n 21\nseparate sleep conditions for twin infants found in this study should therefore be \nregarded as suggestive, not conclusive. We hope this initial research will stimulate \nlarger studies into the issues of twin infant sleeping arrangements. \n \nConclusions \nIn this relatively small study, the co-bedding of term twin infants less than 3 months of \nage does not appear to be associated with the negative attributes that concern \nsome parents. Co-bedded infants neither woke more frequently, nor slept for longer, \nthan those sleeping separately, but experienced greater sleep state synchrony. \nRoutinely co-bedded infants exhibited the most synchronisation. Co-bedded infants \nsleeping in close bodily contact with one another did not exhibit increased core \ntemperature. Swaddling of co-bedded infants may be problematic due to covering \nof external airways, but this is not a problem specific to co-bedding of twins unless \nparents are using swaddling as a means to restrain their babies\u2019 arms in a co-bedded \nscenario. Equivalently sized twins did not compress one another, or cause effective \nobstruction of one another\u2019s airways. Until further data are available caution should \nbe used in co-bedding infants experiencing pyrexia.  This study provides the first \nindicative evidence for the use of health care staff in providing parents with \nevidence-based information about term twin infant sleeping arrangements, and in \nformulating policies and advice. We hope this initial study stimulates further research \non a larger scale. \n \n 22\n References \nAgnew, H. W., V. B. Webb, et al.
