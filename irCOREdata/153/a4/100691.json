These applications range from\nreinforcing filler materials in composites, to extremely high-\nperformance electronic components. However, to realize\nelectronic applications, such as quantum wires,2 ballistic\nconductors,3 microchip interconnects,4 and transistors,5 the\nneed to reproducibly fabricate connections between indi-\nvidual nanotubes and electrodes has been identified as a ma-\njor impediment.6 Indeed, while theoretical studies, and lim-\nited experimentation, have demonstrated carbon nanotubes\nas showing exceptional promise,7 to date only the most ru-\ndimentary devices have been constructed. Most of these de-\nvices are based on small numbers of nanotubes, often limited\nto individual tubes, and have been constructed using suspen-\nsions of nanotubes deposited onto substrates, where electri-\ncal contacts have been deposited previously.8 Furthermore,\nfor devices of any complexity, high repeatability and selec-\ntivity are essential. Methods that show promise with regard\nto manipulating and placing nanotubes at discrete locations\nare becoming available, and connecting and \u201csoldering\u201d of\nindividual nanotubes with atomic force microscope9 and\nscanning electron microscope10,11 has been demonstrated.\nScaling these techniques to produce higher throughput is\nproblematic, however, as nanotube connections can take sev-\neral minutes per joint, as well as problems associated with\ncontaminants from the joining material.\nIn this letter we show a technique to select, manipulate,\nand produce nanotube joints with good mechanical and elec-\ntrical integrity, without the need for a solder material, and\nwith significantly reduced time taken per connected joint.\nThe technique is based on controlled heating of the joints\nformed between nanotubes and substrates, and relies on care-\nful control of applied voltages and subsequent current-\ninduced heating. We also demonstrate the negative effects of\nallowing excessive heating to take place in the nanotubes and\nits effect on the crystalline structure of the nanotube.\nArc-discharge-produced nanotubes of high crystalline\nquality were loaded in a scanning electron microscope\n\u0001SEM\u0002 that includes electrical feedthroughs connected to a\npair of sharp tungsten tips and the specimen substrates. The\ntips can be moved independently of the SEM stage and each\nother by three-axis piezo sliders, with a minimum step size\nof 20 nm and up to 5 mm total travel \u0003Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004. A LABVIEW\nprogram is used to run two Keithley 238 source\/current\nmeters connected to the tips and stage that provide a means\nof electrically characterizing, cutting, and welding individual\nnanotubes.

These deposition sub-\nstrates are typically metal wires and foils, and thin-film\ndepositions on insulating substrates.\nTo select a nanotube for the manipulation process, one of\nthe tips is brought close to a single nanotube on its substrate,\nand the gap is reduced until contact is made. Often, electro-\nstatic attraction pulls the nanotube onto the end of the tip,\nrelieving the need for accurate positioning. A voltage is then\napplied across the nanotube to establish an electrical contact.\nInitially, a poor contact is achieved and the measured current\nrarely exceeds a few nanoamperes, until a threshold voltage\n\u0001\u00053 V\u0002 is reached \u0003Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004. As the voltage is raised fur-\nther, the current then rapidly increases by several orders of\nmagnitude up to a predetermined limit of 1\u000110\u22125 A. This\nlimit is imposed to prevent excessive current causing tube\ndamage or failure. Subsequent cycling of the voltage over a\ntypical range 0 to 5 V with a current limit still imposed re-\nsults in a lowering of the resistance with each successive\ncycle down to approximately 150 k\u0003 for the connection\nshown. We have, however, seen values as low as 12 k\u0003 de-\npending on the carbon nanotube and substrate. The tip-to-\nnanotube contact is now mechanically robust and electrically\nactive. After typically ten cycles, completed in under a\nminute, stable I-V behavior is obtained, with no further con-\nditioning. As can clearly be seen in Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002, initially, the\ncurrent limit of 1\u000110\u22125 A is observed at around 4.5 V, but\nfollowing cycling, the same current can be achieved at lower\nthan 2.5 V. We believe this conditioning behavior is due to\nohmic heating taking place at the connection, caused by the\nlarge current densities, facilitating alloying at the connection.\nCutting nanotubes to a predetermined length is by utiliz-\ning the second tip. A nanotube is connected between the first\n\u0001primary\u0002 tip and the substrate, using the welding technique,\nand then a voltage of typically 1\u20132 V is applied. On bring-\ning the second \u0001cutting\u0002 tip, with a similar voltage, into con-\ntact with the nanotube, at the point cutting is required, and\nthen raising the voltage on the cutting tip while limiting the\ncurrent that can flow into the primary tip to zero, causes all\nthe current to flow in the lower portion of the nanotube at-\ntached to the substrate. This results in a small region of\naround 100\u2013150 nm vaporizing near to the point of contact\nof the cutting tip, leaving the desired length of nanotube\nattached to the first tip. Following the cutting procedure it\nbecomes possible to move the nanotube attached to the tip to\na new substrate and connect it as previously shown. It is also\npossible to connect additional nanotubes to the previously\ndeposited ones. As with attaching to substrates, the nano-\ntubes are brought into contact at the desired point on the\npreviously deposited nanotube and cut off from the tip. How-\never, when nanotubes are connected, no conditioning behav-\nior is observed, and the I-V behavior of the connection is\ninstantly reproducible.\nAs a demonstration of the versatility of this new tech-\nnique, Fig. 3 shows the letters A, T, and I constructed from\ncarbon nanotubes and deposited onto the edge of a chromium\nfoil. The height of the three letters is approximately 1.5 \u0002m,\noccupying a length of less than 4 \u0002m. The figure demon-\nstrates the most important requirements necessary for the\nproduction of three-dimensional nanotube structures; the\nability to pick and place a single nanotube onto a substrate\nwith a specific length \u0001letter \u201cI\u201d\u0002, the ability to attach a sec-\nond nanotube to the first \u0001letter \u201cT\u201d\u0002, and the ability to con-\nnect nanotubes together that have previously been attached\nto a chosen substrate \u0001letter \u201cA\u201d\u0002. All of the connections are\nmechanically strong as well as electrically active.\nUsing the technique just described, we have probed the\neffect of current conduction on the microstructure of indi-\nvidual nanotubes as a function of current density. At the lim-\nits of current carrying capability, massive structural damage\nis done to the crystalline quality of the tube, where in the\nextreme, portions of tube are seen to vaporize. What is less\nclear is to what extent does the welding process possibly\nalter or damage the tubes microstructurally. To this end, we\nhave carried out further experiments wherein portions of\nnanotube are exposed to high currents, and other portions\nexposed to lower, or no current. Figure 4\u0001a\u0002 shows an ex-\nample of how this is achieved, where it can be seen that a\nsingle nanotube is isolated by a tip, and connected some\ndistance from the free end. Now, by carefully limiting the\nmaximum current flow, we can expose the connected side of\nthe tube to current stressing, while the free end sees no flow\nof current. Following current stressing, we place the whole\ntip complete with nanotube into the transmission electron\nmicroscope \u0001TEM\u0002. Figure 4\u0001b\u0002 shows the unstressed side of\nthe tube with Figures 4\u0001c\u0002 and 4\u0001d\u0002 showing the stressed\nsides of a nanotube that was limited to 80 \u0002A maximum\nFIG. 2.

The micrograph of the un-\nstressed side of the nanotube \u0003Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002\u0004 shows well-defined\nconcentric layers consistent with a multiwalled carbon nano-\ntube. By comparison the micrograph of the stressed side\n\u0003Figs. 4\u0001c\u0002 and 4\u0001d\u0002\u0004 shows no well-defined structure, al-\nthough the overall dimensions of the tube appear unchanged.\nElectron energy loss spectra of the stressed tubes also\nreveal the change in their structure. For both the stressed and\nunstressed tubes, the concentration of sp2-type bonded car-\nbon atoms is measured using the normalized area of the \u0004*\npeak12 and is found to 100% sp2, suggesting that stressing\nthe tube has not resulted in the formation of sp3-type bonds.\nThe sharp peak, at \u0005294 eV, in the unstressed tube carbon\nK-edge, characteristic of crystalline graphitic carbon, disap-\npears completely in the K-edge of the stressed tube, confirm-\ning the amorphisation of the tube following the flow of a\nhigh current close to 80 \u0002A through the tube \u0001\u000570\n\u0001106 A\/cm2\u0002. Tubes have been welded with maximum cur-\nrents of 2 \u0002A, \u0001\u00052\u0001106 A\/cm2\u0002 and subsequent TEM ex-\namination of the tube structure near to the contacts shows no\nperceptible structural damage.\nThe average failure power for the tubes measured in this\nstudy is \u000580 \u0002W, which is considerably smaller than the\nfailure power levels in other tubes of comparable sizes and\ntype13 \u0001\u00051 mW\u0002. In multiwalled nanotubes a number of con-\nduction mechanisms have been proposed, with each giving\nrise to different failure thresholds. Nanotubes exhibiting bal-\nlistic conduction have failure powers in excess of 5 mW,14\nalthough ballistic nanotubes in free-standing geometry show\nslightly lower power levels \u00012.5 mW\u0002.15 The failure of nano-\ntubes exhibiting diffusive conduction16 showed a 12 \u0002A per\nlayer saturation current and subsequent failure at \u0005500 \u0002W.\nOxidation assisted by the presence of intrinsic defects of\nthose arisen as a result of the high current density was cited\nas the failure mechanism. In addition, in both diffusive and\nballistic conduction, the point of failure has been correlated\nto specific defects present within the structure15,17.\nThe arc deposited multiwalled nanotubes studied here\nappear to show a broad double peaked distribution in failure\npower, peaking at \u0005180 and 20 \u0002W. There appears to be\ntwo key factors that control the power that can be sustained\nbefore failure in this free-standing geometry. We believe a\ncontributing factor to the lower power failure is the addi-\ntional stress loading on the tubes, which exacerbates any\nfailure at defects possibly due to localized heating. Indeed,\nanecdotally, nanotubes with significant curvature forced\nupon them fail at lower power, which follows due to the\nfree-standing structures having poorer heat dissipation. The\nradiative power loss from an ideal black body of the dimen-\nsions of a nanotube at 2000 K is at least an order of magni-\ntude less than the failure power threshold reported here. This\nlimits the cooling to conduction through the body of the tube\nto the contacts. The cross-sectional area at the contacts,\nthrough which all the heat must flow, can be extremely small,\nand high temperatures can be reached at relatively low power\nlevels, which in turn will increase resistivity in localized sec-\ntions of the tube and cause failure at these defects. The lower\npeak in the distribution may be a result of specific defects of\nmechanical stress\/strain in the tube.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate that it is possible to weld\nnanotubes to metal contacts and to each other with both good\nelectrical and mechanical quality. The procedure is fast\nenough to produce relatively complex structures and uses\nonly the number of nanotubes required. We show that in\nelectrical conduction through the tubes, heat dissipation is\ncrucial if high current density devices are to be fabricated.\nAny structural or mechanical defect compromises the integ-\nrity of the tube, particularly at current densities in excess of\n2\u0001106 A\/cm2. This procedure may be utilized as a tech-\nnique to construct carbon nanotube-based devices and con-\nnections in electronic applications of higher complexity than\npreviously available by other techniques.\nThe authors acknowledge the support received from the\nEPSRC, UK, in the form of a Portfolio Partnership grant.\n1Carbon Nanotubes: Synthesis, Structure, Properties and Application, ed-\nited by M.
