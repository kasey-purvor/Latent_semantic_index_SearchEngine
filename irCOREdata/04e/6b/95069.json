Jones & Sarah Thomas de Ben\u00edtez \n \nAbstract \nThis paper presents material from extended interviews and observations with 25 street \nyouth in Mexico, revealing how their attempts to control and understand their lives relies \non a control of and identification with their bodies. Using Goffman\u2019s ideas of stigma and \nperformance, and Butler\u2019s performativity, the paper illustrates that even if these young \npeoples\u2019 bodies fall short of mainstream ideas for youthful bodies, they have developed \nsome strategies that allow some control over their bodies. These bodily performances differ \naccording to audience. This intention is by no means fully achieved. Their bodily actions \nsets out a series of identity markers but street life implies all sort of events, from painful \nchildhoods to vicious leisure pursuits, and restricts the ability to affect material conditions. \nMoreover, care needs to be taken in interpreting these signs as the participants\u2019 own \nunderstandings and practices are neither easily categorised nor consistent. \n \n \nIntroduction \nFor three years, from 2005, we have been meeting with two groups of young people that \nwork and occasionally sleep on the streets of the Mexican city of Puebla.2 These meetings \nform part of a project to explore how \u2018street youth\u2019 construct identities around daily lives, to \nconsider the stability of these identities and how identity \u2018memberships\u2019 extend beyond \ndistinctive categories such as age, ethnicity and gender to ties such as consumption, national \nidentity and being \u2018in the city\u2019. Our work is based on the argument that participants\u2019 sense of \nidentities is highly fluid and unstable, that given the complex context they are moving in it is \ndifficult to articulate a single sense of \u2018self\u2019 and, contrary to the views held of them by \ngovernment agencies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the media, are possibly \nunable to make up their minds who they are in a well defined static way. As such, talking \nabout and observing their practices have offered us a series of devices through which to \ninterpret their social identities. \n                                                 \n1 Research for this paper was conducted as part of the project \u201cBeing in Public: the multiple childhoods of \nMexican 'street' children\u201d with ESRC grant RES 148-25-0050. Earlier versions of the paper were presented at \nthe Latin American Studies Association conference, Montreal, and the International Conference of Critical \nGeography, Mumbai. We wish to thank participants at those meetings for their questions, Kathrin and Rachel \nand referees for their helpful comments. \n2 We adopt the term youth to describe our key participants who were mostly aged from 12 to 29, the definition \nof youth adopted by the Mexican government. In fact, we had contact with people much older, into their \nfifties, and infants, but whose accounts do not contribute to this paper. \n 1\n Representations of street youth in Mexico, as elsewhere, hold  to their exclusion and ascribe a \nsocial deviance, which is partly \u2018confirmed\u2019 through ideas and images of bodily harm, \ndisruptive behaviours and dangerous bodies (Bar-on 1997; Beazley 2002; Panter-Brick \n2002). In this sense, street youth appeal to Goffman\u2019s astute observations on the notion of \nstigma as \u201c\u2026the situation of the individual who is disqualified from full social acceptance\u201d \n(1990: 9). Such stigma can be derived from marking people out as different through one or \na combination of three signs: abominations of the body; blemishes of character and \ndistinctions of race, nation or religion. So marked, Goffman argued, society would \ntranspose a series of \u201csocial facts\u201d that would \u201cbe attached, entangled, like candy floss, \nbecoming then the sticky substance to which still other biographical facts can be attached\u201d \n(1990: 74 [1963]). Whether it was their intention or not, social deviance would be attributed \nto \u201cprostitutes, drug addicts, delinquents, criminals, jazz musicians, bohemians, gypsies, \ncarnival workers, hobos, winos, show people, full time gamblers, beach dwellers, \nhomosexuals, and the urban unrepentant poor \u2026[as] engaged in some kind of collective \ndenial of the social order\u2026[showing] open disrespect of their betters; they lack piety; they \nrepresent failures in the motivational schemes of society\u201d (1990: 170-171). Not only might \nstreet youth be ascribed with many of the labels listed by Goffman, but as their dress, \nodour, colour and shape, as well as their interaction with society through consumption or work \nwould suggest, they accumulate on their bodies the marks of their difference.3  \n \nThe suggestion of a relationship between bodies, social acceptance and identities became \nan intriguing aspect to our field research. How did participants reconcile their difference and \napparent social deviance, or their conformity, in and through their bodies? Street youths lack \nthe resources with which to \u2018buy into\u2019 consumerist forms of subjectivity \u2013 through body-\nfirming through gym regimes, dental work, to plastic surgery, professionally conducted \ntransgender operations and transplants places their bodies as \u2018natural\u2019 organisms in a world \nof growing modification. But is marking their bodies one of the few ways in which they are \nable to express their connectivity (or difference) from mainstream or other youth subcultures? \n                                                 \n3 There is an abundant imagery of street life as aberrant and non-normative in Mexico, most notably the 2001 \nfilm De la Calle (Dir. Gerardo Tort) which won a number of national and international awards, and lower \nbudget films such as Perro Callejero and Ratas de la Ciudad. \n 2\nIn particular, we became interested in how they used and were aware of their bodies, in \nsettings that were \u2018public\u2019 and how their bodies are produced and represented through links \nwith the material environment (Budgeon 2003; Prout 2000). In this endeavour we follow a \nseries of writers arguing that life is experienced as embodied individuals, perceiving the \nbody not as an exclusively biological unit, but as a manifestation of social and historic \nrelations (Lowe 1986), and going further to suggest that body movements, styles and \nmarkings form experience and hold significance for what they contribute to subjectivity \n(Farnell 1999). As Butler has contended subjectivity is structured through repeated acts that \nset out the idea of an essentialised identity, but these acts do not always conform according \nto time and context, and making for an ambivalent relationship between the body and \nidentities (Butler 1999). Thus, the idea that subjectivity is fully regulated is illusory and \nthere is scope for agency in the contestation of identities and to the idea of identities. If, \nthen, we understand identities as embodied in processes of speech, social relations and \npractices that affect bodies as Butler (1993) contends, then we might consider the \nproduction of bodies as a process whereby meaning is worked out and exhibited. \n \nIn taking these ideas onto the streets as it were, we are especially attracted to Frost\u2019s \nobservation that \u201cdoing looks\u201d is part of a repertoire of actions that create meaning, and \noffer possibilities for recognition (Frost 2003). Some \u2018looks\u2019 are more permanent than \nothers, notably tattoos and scars, which can be revealed along with particular forms of \ndress, speech, or posture, as part of the formation of social relations (Entwistle 2001; Frost \n2003). The appearances are used in order to establish subject positions, transmit discreet \nmeanings to others and the chance to engage with how others read us through complimenting \nparticular behaviours. Thus, the Stigma identified by Goffman can be contested \ndiscursively and in action, the repeated but selective uses of looks can challenge \nstigmatisation even within the confines of social exclusion. Hence, the youths\u2019 bodies may \nbe marked by being on the street in ways over which they have little control, as in the \neffects of road traffic accidents, but which observers regard as synonymous with the \nintentional deviance of the participants [akin to Goffman\u2019s \u2018social facts\u2019]. Differently, in \nhanging around, taking drugs and \u2018acting up\u2019 their performance may be in line with the \nexpectations held for them; a \u2018re-citation\u2019 in Butler\u2019s terms (1993). But, the young people \n 3\nalso use their bodies, mark their bodies or hide their bodies in certain ways sometimes to \naccentuate their identification as a street youth, at other times to obscure this identification. \nWorking through being \u2018identified as\u2019 and \u2018being\u2019 a street child or youth entails a \nperformativity, a doing rather than a pre-determined label (Butler 1993). \n \n \n1. Getting to the street. \nThe original intention of our field research was modest, to produce in-depth primary \nmaterial on how street [youth] construct identities in worlds that most of us would perceive \nto be threatening and traumatic. We were interested in how children and youth see \nthemselves, relate these ideas to how others see them and consider the forms by which \nidentity ascriptions are contested. While it is widely accepted that concepts of childhood \nand \u2018youth\u2019 are socially constructed, young people on the street are especially transgressive \nsubjects challenging normative ideas of childhood, sexuality, language and more. Yet, and \nintriguingly, many agencies and academics find it straightforward to neatly categorise these \nyoung people as \u2018street children\u2019 or to signify unruliness and danger to define them as \n\u2018youth\u2019. While many programmes urge the inclusion or empowerment of street children it is \nrare to read about their creativity or ingenuity, their attitudes toward consumption, music, \ndress or use of media, or first hand how they understand drug use and work. Demoted to the \nnotion \u2018lifestyle\u2019 these themes appear trivial to many in the context of survival; \nunderstanding identities through the body has hardly featured in studies.4\n \nIn our fieldwork we resolved to having an open-mind about what young people might want \nto talk to us about. Between 2005 and through 2008 we spent time with two principal \ngroups, observing their actions and conversations, and recording thoughts in field diaries, \njoining them in activities and conducting occasional semi-structured interviews.5 The first \ngroup spent most of the day at a traffic intersection adjacent to a large market and \ninteracted frequently with traders, pedestrians, as well as people who sit near them in a \nsmall area of shade known as Las Jardineras (the gardens), either briefly as they await a bus \n                                                 \n4 Beazley (2002) and Hecht (1998) are notable exceptions. For a discussion of the absence of concern for the \nbody and bodily movement even in anthropology see Farnell (1999). \n5 This field approach might be summarised as \u2018street ethnography\u2019 (see Gigengack and Gelder 2000). \n 4\nor to drink, sleep or take drugs. Members of this group work as windscreen washers, \nclowns and occasionally run errands. The other group occupies a series of squares and \ngardens on a wide central reservation to a major boulevard (El Bule). They work mostly as \njugglers and sometimes as fire-breathers, and there is much less pedestrian contact and only \nitinerant traders selling chewing gum, phone cards or newspapers. \n \nFrom the earliest encounters with the group the relation between identities and the body was \napparent. We had arranged to meet with an outreach worker of a local NGO who had known \nthe first group for many years and who had offered to introduce us. As we approached it was \npossible to see about six people gathered together looking at a large framed picture.6 Everyone \nwas in animated conversation but quickly stopped to politely acknowledge our presence. \nHands were shaken, careful pronouncements of \u2018welcome\u2019 extended and a few sarcastic \ncomments exchanged. The person who had previously been holding court, Moises, introduced \nhimself with a shy grin but encouraged us to sit and started up a conversation. How far had we \ncome? How long would we stay? Did we know America? While presenting himself as the \nworldly wise traveller savant, one could not but help noticing he had only one leg. As we \nchatted, after a few minutes, Moises became bored and secretively sucked at a PVC soaked \nrag (mona).  His eyes would glaze, speech would slur and for a few moments any awareness \nof what was happening would be lost.  \n  \nWe would see Moises frequently in the coming months though he would often disappear for \nextended periods. He is an enigmatic character. His own accounts of life and his body are \noften ambiguous and sometimes uncertain. He told us he was born in a city different from the \none his friends knew about, though there was some disagreement here too. He also claimed to \nhave lost his leg quite recently in a train related accident while going to a city in southern \nMexico, while other versions recount the loss as the result of a traffic accident in Puebla. \nThere was an on-going claim that he was about to receive a prosthetic limb from an NGO but \nno such limb has ever materialised, even though he spent time in drug rehabilitation which \nwas allegedly part of the bargain. Despite a lack of precision in his narrative it was clear that \n                                                 \n6 The picture was of La Santa Muerte, the death saint, that is popular among the group, as well as associated \nwith drug addicts, criminals, prostitutes and HIV carriers, but actually has much wider appeal as a \u2018crisis \nreligion\u2019 stemming from the economic crises of the last 20 years (see Jones et al. 2007). \n 5\nphysical disability was not a constraint on Moises\u00b4 mobility or life.7 He would come and go \nfrom the Jardineras and work as a clown on the city\u2019s buses.  He claimed to have travelled \nacross the country and to have lived in Los Angeles, California, and he had certainly spent \nsome time in different institutions. Yet his positioning as \u2018able\u2019 in so many ways would not be \nmost peoples\u2019 interpretation, seeing instead a vulnerable young man with a gaunt face and \nshort attention span, probably from drug use.  \n \nFor Moises, as with most of the participants, daily life involved confronting struggles related \nto the ways their bodies are experienced and controlled. Their corporeal experience is in sharp \ncontrast to how contemporary bodies are thought of, highly plastic spaces of freedom onto \nwhich individual desires and creativity can be projected (Armstrong 1983; Frost 2003). \nTheir bodies also appear contrary media representations in Mexico of young male bodies as \nmuscular, powerful, virile, energetic and able to appropriate and enjoy the latest mores of \ncommodity consumption (Huerta 2002; Zarza and Navarrete 2006).8 The \u2018advertised\u2019 male \nis explicitly whiter and taller than the majority of mestizo Mexicans, implicitly better off, \neducated and an actual or potential family man. By contrast Moises\u00b4s body seemingly \nmanifests the absence of self-control, from the slips into unconsciousness driven by the use \nof inhalants to a leg lost in a street adventure, and  few of the normative forms of health, \ndress, or hygiene.9 The display of imperfect or non-normative bodies provide legitimacy to \nthe social \u2018discipline\u2019 through the state and NGOs, or vigilante groups (Foucault 1992).10 \nFor young men such as Moises, his difference and defiled body raise the stakes even \nfurther. A melancholic slant to his conversations does suggest damage, both physical and \npsychological, but for all that Moises is both capable of interpreting his situation and resisting \ncategorisation. In 2006 he had attempted to sue the state government for abuse while in a \n                                                 \n7 Ambiguities in the narratives of street youth are not unusual. Some have events to hide and many, such as \nMoises, have histories of abuse including beatings in childhood and assaults in juvenile detention. \n8 Women are present in both groups and perform a number of important and explicitly gendered roles, re \ncontrolling drug consumption and baby care, and the emotional support of some group members (see Jones et \nal 2007). But for the purposes of this article we focus mainly on the males. \n9 Moises would often retain elements of his clown make-up long after working on the buses was finished for \nthe day. Around the Jardineras too was ample evidence to anyone passing of the detritus of drug use, illness \n(vomit), hygiene (excrement, flies, dogs) and violence (blood).  \n10 Many of our research participants had spent considerable periods of time in government shelters (Casa de la \nFamilia) or the Juvenile Detention and Rehabilitation Centre (CORSMIEP, known as the Tutelar). Some had \nconsiderable \u2018institutional careers\u2019 but had ended back on the streets, being categorised in the NGO jargon as \n\u201cpermanentes\u201d, those beyond rehabilitation.  \n 6\nrehabilitation centre and sought the assistance of the Commission for Human Rights. Thus, in \nthinking about street youth we wish to stress the (possibly enhanced) importance of bodies \nto the construction of identities through modification and subtle realisation. \n \n \n2. Working on the Street. \nFor most of the youth we met, being on the street was primarily a source of income, \nspending much of the day from as early as 6am cleaning windscreens, working as clowns or \njugglers. These activities require some training and considerable control of the body: \nsmooth specific movements, ability to cope with traffic, skill to deal with the tools and \nprops and, as in the case of some of the jugglers and acrobats, physical strength and \nbalance. When two members of the Jardineras group, Alvaro and Alfonso, suggested \nGareth join them to wash car windscreens they were at pains to point out the importance of \nbeing courteous, never continuing to wash a screen when the driver had waived them away, \nof not swearing in front of drivers and acting the fool. Great care is also taken in not \ndamaging wiper blades, wing mirrors or denting bodywork, although Alvaro noted that \nsitting on a bonnet when not strictly necessary was one way to threaten a rude driver with \nthe possibility that damage might happen even if he is careful that it does not. \n \nAlthough the washers, street clowns and jugglers might be described as scruffy by someone \non their way to work in an office, all of the participants attach great importance to their \nappearance, realising that it is vital to their relationship with drivers, the police and passing \ngirls\/women. At the Jardineras the windscreen cleaners don yellow t-shirts that signify their \nmembership of the 28 de Octubre street trader organisation, making for a rather surreal \nscene when moving around the dense traffic in groups. But when the working day is over, \nthe youth stretch up to rucksacks hanging from branches of trees to transform themselves. \nBoys rinse their hands and their faces, comb their hair, change their T-shirts and, especially \nin the case of windscreen washers, reveal a second pair of trousers in much better condition \nthan those used for work. As might be expected of most (young) people, this bodily \ntransformation can be even more dramatic if the opportunity for meeting a sexual partner \npresents itself. Once, Ramon, a 21-year-old windscreen cleaner, left early from the \n 7\nintersection, saying he had to get ready for a date with a girl.  After a couple of hours, \nRamon returned having had a haircut, a shower, and sporting a new pair of trousers and \nshoes.  He only stayed a few minutes, long enough to show off, before he dashed to catch \nthe bus to his friend\u2019s house.   \n \nWorking on the streets means that certain strategies of bodily presentation also have to be \nadopted in order to keep control of the work space and to improve income. Most  strategies \nare intended to reduce the difference between street youth and the public, since they are \naware that this would be unhelpful and might get them into trouble. As Manuel, a 23 years \nold juggler pointed out:   \n \nLook, you can see how people are at a glance. I mean, you can not cheat anybody. If \nyou see somebody using drugs, or even through their appearance, how they are \naround looking stoned. And, for example, we always come [to the street] clean, \nnever dirty, then you can notice, if people come by and see you clean everyday and \nconscious in your five senses, you can realize. Then you go and see other guys \nalmost falling down and with their hand in here [covering his nose and mouth to \nmimic inhalant use]. You always know where drug addicts are. Do you  understand?  \nThat is the reason why many people who pass by here everyday give us [money]. \n \nManuel is aware of the existence of the stigma surrounding street work. The windscreen \ncleaners are commonly considered as dirty drug users by mainstream society, therefore it is \nimportant to display a performance that unsettles this perception.  Among the participants \nthere is a strong sense of a correct use and conduct of the body while at work. Talking to \nRodrigo, a windscreen cleaner aged 26, he commented on having to keep self control even \nwhen drivers or the police are aggressive. He notes how the circumstances surrounding the \nbody change with age, including attitudes to dirt: \n \nOne changes because one grows up. You change because of the way you grow up, \nyou start to make some changes in your life. You start to see life very differently. \nAfter 20, 25, 23 years you see life with more responsibility because no one gives \nyou anything [now] like when you were a little boy. Because when you are younger \n 8\npeople notice you are dirty and everything, and they say \u201cWell, poor boy, let\u2019s give \nhim something\u201d. But when we are older the people notice we are dirty and [their \nattitude is] \u201cYou lazy man, go and get a job!\u201d\u2026Yeah, well, I imagine that people \nhave told me that because they are not in a good mood, they must be angry about \nsomething that happened to them at home, or anything. But [if we] think about this \nproperly, I do not assault them, I am not taking anything from them. If they want to \ngive some money, well, they give it to me, if they do not want to give money they \nsimply don\u2019t. I wash windscreens. I have met people who just because I clean the \nwindscreen of their car insult me and curse my mother. Instead of facing them and \nyelling: AH! I prefer to just turn around and think to myself \u201cThanks, at least you \nmake me think about my mother, because, certainly, I do not see her very often\u201d. \nBut, well, there are also generous people who give you 20 pesos or 50 pesos. They \nsay \u201cCome on\u201d. Just like I was telling you, they realize that somehow one is trying \nto gain an honest living, not through crime. \n \nRodrigo\u00b4s narrative shows that, for him, social interaction is related to his body: relations \nwith others is not about compassion (which links to childhood), but a sense of empathy \n(linked to work). A challenge to these relations is responded to by Rodrigo turning away. \nAs such he and others, aware of the stereotypes surrounding their condition, try present \ntheir bodies in ways that reduce or soften the stigma associated with street youth and \npresent a performance of \u2018legitimate\u2019 work.  \n \nThe clown performance also demands certain kind of behavior to deal with differences. It \nwas pointed out that to \u2018act the clown\u2019 properly, and successfully in terms of income, relies \nnot only in the appearance of the body which often requires a significant investment in \nterms of time and planning \u2013 they buy and put on make up collectively and carefully, \nacquire clothing and practice their speeches - but also in the suppression or hiding of \nspecific actions. Elsa\u2019s field notebook records:  \n \nWhen I went with Lucio and Fabio to buy some cookies and soda (which Lucio \nsuggested) they started up a conversation about working as street clowns. They said \n 9\nthat clowning can be a very good work only if it is undertaken seriously, just as they \nclaim to. \u201cThere are these clowns who get onto the buses using drugs, people just \ndismiss them\u201d. They explained also that they take good care about their make up \nand prefer not to use plastic noses [A boy had just passed by wearing clown make-\nup and a large plastic nose]. Apparently one has to be suspicious about big noses, \nbecause some street clowns use them to hide pieces of toilet paper soaked in \nindustrial solvent. This practice, Lucio and Fabio alleged, damages the clown image \nand ruins the opportunities for work. \n \nAmong the participants there is a clear representation of what fits or not in public settings. \nEspecially when talking about work  they seem to be very aware of the kind of presentation \nand conduct of the body that must be adopted in order to give legitimacy to their presence.  \n \nThis reflection is not limited to street performances. The street youth expressed concern \nabout the social consequences of marking their bodies in other and more permanent ways. \nA number, for example, possess tattoos, most frequently located on the chest, back and \nshoulders. Very few have tattoos on the more exposed parts of their body which they \nexplained would have adverse affects on gaining a job. Mateo expressed it this way: \n \nMateo: You go and try to find a job and people tell you [if you have tattoos] that \nyou have been in jail. They look at you the wrong way. Do you understand? \nBecause for regular jobs they ask you not to have tattoos or piercings, I mean, you \nhave to be fine, like a person, \nElsa: Have you ever gone to look for a job and they have asked you this? \nMateo: Yes, before I worked here, before I washed windscreens, I used to work in a \nsupermarket, and that is what they asked me: Not to have tattoos or piercings\u2026[also \nto] shave, have well cut nails. \n \n 10\nWhile participants in general try to present their bodies in ways that create some sense of \nsocial belonging and therefore reduce their alienation, not all have done so.11 Carlos, a \nwindscreen cleaner, was a notable exception with several tattoos on his face. Amidst the \ninitials of former loves, including a \u2018V\u2019 on his cheek for his first partner Viviana (the \u2018V\u2019 \nwas overlaid with another letter that nobody could identify) and an \u2018M\u2019 for Mayra his \nsecond partner and also a one-time street sleeper (nicknamed \u2018the panther\u2019, Mayra has a \u2018C\u2019 \non her cheek), was a teardrop. While the mutual facial tattooing might be interpreted as a \nsign of social\/sexual bonding and afforded Carlos the nickname of L\u00e1grimas (tear), or an \nindication of gang membership (many of his friends were gang members), it also suggests \nthe extent of Carlos\u2019s alienation from social norms, even as expressed among the street \ngroups (Jones et al 2007).12 Although Carlos\u2019s case is unusual, it illustrates the tension felt \nby the participants for distinguishing carefully between what \u2018looks\u2019 and acts contribute to \nthe image of being a worker and what reinforce the image of being \u201cfrom the street\u201d.13 For \nmost participants, however, keeping up this distinction at a practical level is almost \nimpossible, as their lives are linked to other practices that conflict with social norms, and \nwhich involve and are marked through bodily practices. Street youths\u2019 attempt to control \ntheir representation is therefore discontinuous and partial. \n \n3. Using Drugs. \nOne of the most common \u2018facts\u2019 that attach themselves to the stigma of street youth is drug \nconsumption which, as noted already, rests uneasily with work as well as mainstream \nexpectations of health and social conformity (Maclean 2007). Among our groups drug use \nis a regular practice that, contrary to outsider perception, is claimed to afford some \nopportunities for control over their bodies or practices that they discuss as affording \ncontrol. Thus, although drugs offer the chance to be \u2018out of it\u2019, and for many will involve \n                                                 \n11 The use of tattoo in Mexican counterculture is widespread with punk, \u2018Dark\u2019 and Goths using elaborate and \noften highly displayed symbols, see Castillo Berthier (2002). Only a few of our participants\u2019 tattoos hold \naffinities with the counter-culture interpretations that speak to group memberships and intimate self-\nidentification that may have (combinations of) spiritual, sexual or political dimensions (Fisher 2002). \n12 In tattoo iconography tears sometimes symbolize the death of a family member or close friend while in \ndetention, and are often related to gang membership in Central America and the US (Phillips 2001; Rocha \n2003; Zilberg 2007). \n13 Jacobson and Luzzatto (2004) show how similar attitudes to permanent tattoos are expressed by young \nIsraelis some of whom will be eligible for military service.  \n 11\npsychotic episodes or involvement in unprovoked violence, the participants manage their \nconsumption. They are extremely aware that the discourse of \u2018street youth\u2019 associates drug \nuse with vagrancy and criminal behavior, and so develop a series of strategies that present \naddictions as a health issue and not a matter of juvenile or criminal justice. Consequently \nroutines are performed that enable drugs to be taken in public space.  \n \nThe effective deployment of these routines requires considerable control of the body, a \nquality which, in contradiction, drugs often takes away. Although most will use drugs at \nsome point of their day, some participants such as Jorge, a 17 years old who works as a \nclown and is a heavy user, claim not to do so: \n \nTo be honest, at the beginning [when he began work as a street clown] I used to get \ndrugged in the street, wearing clown make up. I did not care. But, then, well you \nrealize that because of that, people dismiss you. Now I prefer to finish work and if I \nwant to do it [get drugged] on the street, but I have to finish work. \n \nAmong both groups drug use calls for careful selection of timing and place. The jugglers at \nthe Boulevard combine work with the consumption of pills. These have the advantage of \nquick ingestion and are easy to disguise, important in such a visible location, with passing \npolice patrols and near to malls and middle\/high class residential areas. To an onlooker pills \nappear not to affect the body, sometimes just a purple tongue in the short term, and spots or \nnasal excretion over the longer term. Rather, the pills offer a presentation of being alert, \ncheery and provide users the stamina for their long days of physical activity.  \n \nNevertheless most of the participants take a higher risk by using marijuana, inhalants14 or \nalcohol, substances that compromise the body through the smell, demand a less discrete \ndisplay and may involve collective organisation. Monas, rags dipped in solvent, will \nsometimes be disguised in sweet containers or cans, giving the impression to the uninitiated \nthat they are eating or having a soft drink. In the Jardineras, longer sessions of mona use are \nalways undertaken to the back where low walls offer some protection from a bystanders \n                                                 \n14 Most use PVC, but thinners (tiner) and industrial solvents (\u2018chemo\u2019 or \u2018activo\u2019) are also common. \n 12\ngaze and large piles of rubbish permit instant discarding of any utensils should suspicions \nbe aroused. Using marijuana or alcohol is usually a group practice, even if not all of them \nare going to smoke or drink, standing one in front each other, gives them the chance to \nmonitor the space around  and notice if the police or anyone else is getting close.15\n \nDrug use, of course, offers the opportunity for altered bodily states, to feel pleasure and \ndeal with pain, emotional or physical. According to Jorge:  \n \nMany times one has problems. Let\u2019s give an example: there are people who use \ndrugs because their wives, their girlfriends, have left them. One starts on drugs, \nstarts on drugs, and like he [his friend Hector] has just said: You feel good simply \nbecause of the way you feel it, because of the experience of the drug. You can \nforget. You can forget what was on your mind, what you were worried about. The \nmore you like it, the more you use drugs.  \n \nThe narrative with the repetition and stammering prose reflects as much as describes this \naltered consciousness. The suggestion of \u2018forgetting\u2019 is especially useful for young people \nwho have experienced difficult childhoods and family mistreatment, the lack of supervision \non the street allows drug use but the narratives are clear that consumption is not because of \ntheir street situations. In an extract from the field notebook, Rodrigo explains why got into \ndrugs: \n \nWell, look, me, in my family, because I had family. The truth is that my parents got \nseparated when I was 14, 13 years old. When I still lived with them I started, I \nstarted to get into drugs. My father, I do not judge him, was a drug addict. My \nmother was a prostitute for a while. \n  \nDrug use can be understood as a way in which these young people try to gain control of \ntheir bodies by putting away, if just momentary, unpleasant pasts and empty presents. They \nare usually aware of the impact of this practice on their bodies. In their search for some \n                                                 \n15 Crack (roca) is used rarely, not by many, and never on the street. \n 13\nform of serenity or fun (indications in itself of their limited access to other forms of \ngratification), some consume large amounts of drugs and alcohol despite their obvious \nnoxious effects. Drug consumption presents a paradox: the pursuit of pleasure through \nmeans harmful to physical health: \n  \nJorge: Maybe that\u2019s why my mind is so messed up.  From the PVC, I mean.  \nMaybe that\u2019s really why, because at first I just smoked pot and didn\u2019t have \nthese hallucinations.  Maybe that\u2019s really why: the PVC is cooking my brain \nand now if I smoke pot I\u2019ll have hallucinations too. \nElsa: And why do you say your brain is messed up?  You feel it?  \nJorge: Because, like, well, you know, everyone always\u2026 For example, \neveryone I know that is addicted to PVC is in a bad way, that is, they\u2019re not \nquite right in the head.  PVC scorches your neurons. Ten thousand neurons. \nElsa: Ten thousand neurons?  And how do you know that? \nJorge: Because a doctor told me; it burns out ten thousand neurons each time. \nElsa: And you don\u2019t care? \nJorge: Not really, not anymore. \nElsa: Why not? \nJorge: Well, like, it\u2019s done already; it\u2019s a need.  It\u2019s like your daily food. \n \nDrug use represent two extreme positions on the regulation and performance of the body. \nOn the one hand use resists mainstream discourses on healthy docile bodies and therefore \ndemands the development of a set of strategies in order to keep some degree of privacy, so \nthe body becomes a site of a certain self control. On the other, the effects of drugs on the \nbodies can be profound. In daily life drug use acts as an appetite suppressant, so that when \nEmilio, a thin 19 year old, is given a huge meat taco and despite frequent muttering about \nhis hunger he handed it to Mina to share out so that he could continue inhaling PVC. \nHarder to observe are the hallucinations, mood swings, memory loss and links to suicidal \nideation, all of which we have recorded on occasion. What is more tangible, is that the loss \nof control invokes the direct control of institutions which aim to suppress drug use as a \nmean to reduce street youth \u00a8deviance\u00b4, which we explore more closely in section 5. \n 14\n  \n4. (Re)acting violently. \nLike drug use, violence has ambivalent meanings in terms of the boys\u2019 understandings and \nthe control of their bodies. Most of our participants have experienced physical violence \nsince childhood and on the streets. Contrary to the discourses that build representations of \nstreet youth their encounters with violence are not specific to their being. Domestic \nviolence is prevalent but largely unspoken of in Mexico, gangs and the police construct \nsubjective ideas of the self through notions of violence (Castillo and Jones 2009; Knaul and \nRam\u00edrez 2005). For street youth the marks of violence is as much evidence of events in the \npast being lived out in the present. And as Hecht from his research with street children in \nBrazil goes so far as to suggest this violence will impact on the future: \n \nviolence against and by street children is a part of the fabric of life in which \nthese victims and perpetrators dangerously live, so much as that they \ninterweave their fanciful dreams of somebody settling down and having a \ncouple of children with the more frank admission that they have little \nexpectation of growing up to be adults. Violence is an aspect of identity as \ntragically indelible as the scars that crisscross their bodies. (1998: 145) \n \nThe accounts of the scars inflicted by parental abuse are usually accompanied by evasive, \nsidelong glances and laconic descriptions; the older participants never venturing to talk \nabout the subject. Fourteen-year-old Enrique recounts harrowing stories about his \u201cshitty \nlife\u201d: his father used to beat him with lead pipes and sticks, and even attacked him with a \nfretsaw, which is why he is staying at a government-run shelter. These kinds of marks and \nbodily harm reflect a state of defencelessness because they were acquired in childhood. \nRene, 17, recalls his narrow escape from a vicious beating: \n \nOnce, when I was about seven, my father got mad at me. He grabbed me and \nthrew me onto the table.  He threw me so hard that the table broke.  Then, \nbecause I knew that he would keep on beating me, I ran out of the house and \ninto the street.  My friends were there and I started juggling.  I was doing all \nright until a car crushed my leg; it got caught between two cars.  I was rolling \naround on the ground in pain, and the Domino\u2019s Pizza guys, who were my \nbuddies, took me to the Red Cross, but first they really beat the shit out of the \ndriver, since it was all his fault. \n 15\n \nIn these situations, the subjugated body can do little but to run away. Yet, display of the \nbodily marks acquired in childhood as a result of domestic violence are threatening to \nstreet youth, representing them as victims, a not very useful adscription in circumstances \nrequiring a toughness and a legitimative discourse of self imposed destitution. Hence most \nof our research participants include bodily marks incurred since arrival on the street and \nwhich are more visible. Rodrigo has three cigarette burns on the back of his hand, near the \nthumb, to represent his membership of a clica for a gang of cholos called HEM (Hecho en \nM\u00e9xico, Made in Mexico). The three dots stand for \u2018money, drugs and women\u2019 and \nindicate both a belonging and a tolerance for pain. Toughness is a requirement of HEM \nmembership, starting with the initiation rite of a 29-second beating administered by several \ngang members. Rodrigo believes that the clica\u2019s most important activities were \u201cto apply \nthemselves\u201d - painting graffiti of the gang\u2019s emblem throughout the city as a sign of its \ninfluence - and holding \u2018paris\u2019 (parties) featuring hip-hop music, heavy alcohol and drug \nconsumption, and to provide support for other members with lead pipes, stones or \noccasionally firearms.  \n \nBut, although Rodrigo and others have a preference for a cholo style of dress, baggy chinos \nor jeans, ironed shirts, clean trainers, with items such as belts or chains which can be used \nin fights, this identity is not for display in the \u2018work state\u2019 of the market or crossroads.  The \nperformance of the tough banda member image is directed at a different audience. Ramon, \n21, had been in a gang in Mexico City which was involved in street crime:   \n \nRamon: Yes, because when bandas come across each other and\u2026If I see a banda \ntrying to take some advantage in the wrong territory, we have to kick them out. Just \nlike that, just hit them with anything, fists, knives, belts. I mean whatever you can \nreach with your hands, it does not matter - You have to defend yourself \nElsa: Have you been in those kind of fights? \nRamon: Yeah \nElsa: But, you used whatever you could get your hands on? You were not armed, \nwere you? \nRamon: Whatever, well, I used to be armed, I had a revolver, a 38, a revolver.  \n 16\n Ramon displayed some of this physical toughness when on the streets but it was notable \nhow he kept his involvement in banda in the settlements where he hung out separate from \nhis relationships in the Jardineras.16  As happened on occasion, a banda member would \ndraw up on a minibus or motorbike, and Ramon would break off from work and go over. \nExcept with others known as to be in a gang such as Rodrigo, Ramon would never involve \nothers in these conversations. Being a street youth and being a gang member were separate. \n \nAlthough accounts of violent episodes that occurred in later life are more likely to be \narticulated as marks of heroism, skill or duty, closer contact with the participants leaves the \nimpression that for most to represent their bodies as tough and strong is not easy. Ramon, \nalong with Rodrigo, through reputation and action, represent the \u2018harder\u2019 side of street life \nsince they have been involved with gangs and prison.17 Keeping to a performance of being \n\u2018hard\u2019 relies not only on the way Ramon articulates his past but also in the way he  presents \nhimself day to day. He frequently dresses in NBA or NFL labelled sportswear and often in \nsuch a way as to display bicep and quad muscles. Nevertheless, Ramon\u2019s use of mona and \nmarijuana presents his body as weak. On one occasion Ramon spent the entire morning just \nsleeping in the Jardineras after smoking marijuana, and much to the annoyance of others \nwho regarded this as abdication of work. Another time he challenged Gareth to an arm-\nwrestle and was surprised to be repeatedly beaten much to everyone\u2019s amusement (and \nunlikely in any other circumstance). \n  \nViolence is a fundamental way to gain respect and solve problems on the street \u2013 fights are \ncommon within the groups and in attacks on drunks or other drug users, and in defence of \nterritory. However, the apparent toughness and uses of violence are treated with care. \nThough the line is often crossed, they know that violence will draw the attention of the \npolice or, in the case of the Jardineras, the social movement that informally polices the area \n                                                 \n16 As Entwistle (2001) highlights, dress is both a social and bodily experience, that in this case marks the \nboundary between the self-representation as \u2018street involved\u2019 or outside of a street life. \n17 On youth gang identities see Castillo Berthier and Jones (2009). Most participants contested any ascription \nto being gang members or being like a gang, and it angered them when NGO workers were not so cautious.  \n 17\nand prohibits drug use, petty crime and fights.  Alvaro, a 24 year old windscreen washer \nand clown, got involved in an incident which illustrates this process: \n \nDo\u00f1a Conchita told me that about eleven o\u00b4clock in the morning the police had \ntaken her son Alvaro to the station. There had been a fight between Alvaro and \nsome people from the market next to their work place, particularly with \u201cThe son of \nDamian, the guy from the laundry\u201d. Do\u00f1a Conchita said that the two of them began \na fight which Alvaro was clearly losing \u201cHe was already lying on the floor, he was \nbeing ahorcado (strangled) and tears were coming out from his eyes\u201d. Someone in \nDamian\u2019s family called the police and they bundled Alvaro into the patrol car. \nLucio [Alvaro\u00b4s younger brother aged 15) told me that the police \u201cDo not get you \ninto the patrol in a nice gentle way, they just grab you from here [from the waistline \nof the pants and from the shoulder] and then just throw you down, any way\u201d  \n \nAlvaro was a likely victim of any beating, with a precocious personality but a heavy drug \nuse that has left him thin. The fight described above whipped everyone into a heightened \nstate of anxiety, uncertain what would happen to Alvaro in the police car or cell, and how \nthis violent confrontation would play out in terms of relations with the market trader \norganization under whose sanction the street youth are allowed to remain. Despite \nexpressions of bravado in which some threatened to get hoods (encapucharse) and attack \nthe traders with baseball bats, the toughness was from frustration at their helplessness and \nquickly subsided once Alvaro returned some hours later. \n \nOn this occasion Alvaro\u2019s confinement was brief, but most participants\u2019 contacts with \ngovernment and NGO institutions is longer term. This relationship is partly primed by the \nreading of street youth\u2019s bodily control, through drugs, violence or diet, and the imperative \nto impose a \u2018normalising\u2019 disciplining project. As we outline in the final section, however, \nconfinement marks just one more site for the struggle over losing and (re) gaining control \nover the body, since the street youths\u2019 difference once produced is not something which can \nbe easily changed. \n \n 18\n5. Entering Confinement.  \nEven if the street constitutes a space in which the youth make decisions about the routines \nof work and leisure, they are aware that the so-called \u2018freedom of the streets\u2019 is conditioned \nby their bodily actions and how these are read by others. Many of the participants recount \nclashes with the police, sometimes brought on by street fights or substance abuse, and \noccasionally by link to crime.18 In the Jardineras especially, the police will search \nrucksacks, clothes and test the breath for the telltale odour of mona. A blast of solvent-\nsmelling breath can provoke 18-hours in detention, in addition to considerable verbal and \noccasionally physical abuse. Sometimes, contact between street youth and the police end up \nwith confiscation of belongings, an intimidating drive in the patrol car and extortion of \nmoney, but on other occasions these encounters end at the gates of an institution. If \ndetained, and sent on to the Shelter (Casa de la Familia) or the Juvenile Detention Centre \n[see Footnote 10], or to the privately run Annexes (Anexos)19 street youth are supposed to \nsettle into a range of activities, attend schooling or training, eat three times a day, help with \nhousework and participate in recreation activities. Inside the institutions activities are set in \nhighly defined timeframes. Emilio describes his stay at one facility, the constant \u2018meetings\u2019 \nto convert the boys from drug use and model perfect behaviours:  \n \nEmilio: I had to get there in time for the meeting.  It starts at nine, sometimes \nat nine thirty.  Then we go down to breakfast and then we do our chores.  \nWhen we finish, the bell rings and we go up to the meeting \u2014another meeting \nfrom ten o\u2019clock to twelve, around noon.  During that meeting, we don\u2019t eat at \nall; we just hang on.  Well, they give us stuff like fruit, but I don\u2019t like it \nbecause sometimes it\u2019s rotten.  The ten o\u2019clock meeting ends at noon.  Then \nwe go back to our chores.  Then there\u2019s the meeting from one to three o\u2019clock, \nbecause from ten to noon we hardly eat at all.  The one o\u2019clock meeting ends \nat three, and then there\u2019s another meeting in the afternoon from four to six.  \nElsa: So then, when do you get to eat? \nEmilio: At three o\u2019clock.  At four, we\u2019re at another meeting, that ends at six \nand then there\u2019s another one from seven to nine.  On Mondays, it\u2019s from ten to \ntwelve. \nElsa: At night? \nEmilio: That\u2019s right. There are meetings that last into the night; sometimes \nthey end around one thirty.  We go to bed and then at six it\u2019s time to get up \nagain. \n                                                 \n18 Rodrigo and Ramon went into prison because of their individual involvement in burglary.  \n19 Anexos are Alcoholics Anonymous rehab facilities, run by ex addicts. See Thomas de Benitez (2008).  \n 19\n Emilio is a heavy user of PVC so the regime of meetings, sleeping through the boredom to \nbe awoken with buckets of cold water thrown over him, was the antithesis of the street \nwhere he can hang out at the market but (in his case) rarely do any work.  \n \nYet, with the exception of prison, most of the participants recall the time spent in the \ninstitutions as easy-going for many reasons, some of which do not form part of the official \nobjectives: \n \nRene was reminded of the time he spent in the Tutelar [Juvenile Centre]. He \nconsiders this time some kind of golden age: He remembers himself working in the \nfield, how good he was at getting rid of the weeds, taking care of the lambs, and \nkilling rabbits and chickens. He remembered he was a good basketball player, and \nthe favourite of some of the staff, [that] he fell in love with a girl\u2026\u201cI really, really \nliked it [at the Tutelar]\u201d he said \n \nDespite Rene\u2019s good memories, he is aware that getting into this kind of institution has to \ndo with the conduct and appearance of his body, he was taken to the Tutelar because he was \ninhaling solvent on the street. Occasionally Rene has gone back to the Tutelar to visit some \nof the staff he has remained friendly with, an experience he described: \n \nRene told me he went yesterday to the Tutelar to visit Enedina, his God mother. She \nwas not there but he talked to Rosi, the psychologist, and with Felicitas who taught \nhim how to read and write during his stay \u2026Rene pointed out that before entering \nthe Tutelar, he took off his \u201crock outfit\u201d (black jacket and \u201cSanta Muerte\u201d T-shirt) \nbecause he thought that if he arrived looking like that he would not be allowed to \nleave. He thinks that in these clothes he looks aggressive, like a delinquent, so, he \nput the jacket inside his rucksack, and used a check shirt to cover the Santa Muerte \nT-shirt. \n \n 20\nFrom his account, one can perceive Rene\u2019s concern about entering such a controlling space \nwhich requires his careful attention to presentation and conduct. \n \nSpending time at an institution has many direct effects on the youths\u2019 bodies. A visible but \nnot obvious consequence of being in an institution is the effect on skin colour. Participants \nare very conscious that their skin, more than just suntanned, is weather-beaten and parched \nbecause of the considerable time they spend outside. When Lucio, aged 15, returned to the \nstreets after being in an Anexo everyone commented on his paleness. As part of this \ninterchange, Mateo expressed his desire to find a job in an enclosed space, at least for a \nwhile \u201cto get rid of the black colour\u201d (on a separate occasion we witnessed Mateo \nappearing to be use sun block on his skin).  Lucio then proceeded to enumerate all those \nwho are \u201cblack from so much cleaning\u201d and, in what was clearly an unintentional paradox, \ncommented  \u201cMy brother Jaki, el Chino, Mateo, they are all now black, really pitch-black\u201d \nfrom being in the sun cleaning windscreens. Youths with brown-skin courtesy of their \nmestizo ethnicity are attuned to the darkening effects of prolonged exposure to the sun and \nto a social context that upholds lighter skin with beauty and wealth. \n \nWeight changes can also result from staying in an institution, including as a consequence of \nnot being able to take drugs (regarded positively by our participants) and the regular diets \nmean that is usual for participants to gain weight during their stay. The facial features of \nAlvaro for example shifted from a gaunt figure with sunken cheeks and eyes, a waxy skin \ncomplexion and spots, to a puffy face that seemed barely recognisable after three months in \nan Anexo. Having a skinny face is associated with heavy drug use while being fat (as they \nput it) \u2013 meaning healthy - is a sign of pride that marks a control of addiction. Most, \nhowever, do not maintain this appearance for long as drug use starts again. When talking to \nDario, one of the older windscreen washers, he commented on Lucio and Alvaro\u2019s recent \nreturn to the street after their stay in an Anexo. Dario noted that the two were already into \ndrugs \u201cYou are going to see them like this [He sucked his cheeks to give the impression of \na skinny face] all sucked, sucked\u201d. According to him the boys now just come to the street to \nplay video games and take drugs, joking that they \u201cjust went to the Anexo to have some \nfood\u201d. The pride expressed at controlling their drug use during confinement and for some \n 21\nweeks after release quickly subsides to become a source of ridicule for others and some \ndepression for those involved. \n \nWhile confinement can transform bodies briefly to give the appearance of similarity \nbetween street youth and mainstream notions of health, confinement leaves other marks on \nthe bodies, particularly through self-harm. As Thomas (2008) has observed, self-inflicted \npain is common in these institutions because the inmates find themselves with little space \nfor decision-making, as already indicated by Emilio\u2019s attitude to meetings. The body \nbecomes almost the only site onto which they can express some control.20 In the youths\u2019 \nnarratives self-harm features as an ambivalent sign as a marked body tough enough to \nendure pain and yet reflect emotional turmoil. At the state-run temporary shelter, some of \nthe boys displayed self-inflicted scars. With some pride, Victor displayed a scar comprised \nof fine lines on his left shoulder; a swastika-shaped incision he had performed himself, \u201cthe \nNazi symbol,\u201d he added.  Alberto has several lines on his forearm and wrist, virtually \nimperceptible but which he claims spell out the name of his girlfriend, Hilda. For them, \nthese practices are proof that their bodies can withstand pain physically and project feelings \nsuch as love or despair. \n \nSpending time in prison often leaves permanent marks on the body, tattoos and scars are \ncommon examples. From his time in prison, Rodrigo has a tattooed bracelet on his shoulder \nas a memento. He explained that it is common practice for one inmate to tattoo another. \nAnother windscreen washer, Edmundo also has tattoos acquired during his time in prison - \non his forearm a heart crossed by a burning sword and on his arm a heart with the letters \n\u201cJ\u201d and \u201cA\u201d from an earlier romance. On the other arm he has \u201cMaria\u201d the name of his \nmother and the name of the Virgin (of Guadalupe), and on his chest there is an incomplete \nimage of the Sacred Heart of Jesus that could not be finished because he was released \nsooner than expected. While both Edmundo\u2019s and Rodrigo\u2019s tattoos relate to prison, as with \nso many of the other bodily marks we must note the difference and inconsistency from \nstraightforward interpretation. Rodrigo has spent considerably more time in prison than \n                                                 \n20 Boredom, depression and other psychological explanations can be understood as a result of the unfavorable \nenvironment surrounding the detainees rather than as a manifestation of individual psychopathology (see \nThomas et al 2006). \n 22\nEdmundo, but has only one discrete tattoo, while Edmundo has more, larger and visible \nimages. Rodrigo\u2019s tattoos represent his immersion into prison life and he knows that these \nmarks will go with him onto the street, subsequently he covers them up whenever possible, \nwhereas Lorenzo\u2019s tattoos represent reminders of what he left outside of prison and are thus \nmore acceptable for display on the streets.  \n \nConclusion. \nAlthough it is widely accepted that the body transcends its biological limits and is \nrecognized as a social construction, the nature of this transcendence is keenly debated. For \nthose, following Foucault, the power of discourse and practice is exerted to control the \nbody. For Goffman, bodies are subject to the stigmas imposed upon them by others, either \nencouraging confirmation through performance or motivating presentations of the self that \ndispel notions of conformity. For Butler, the body exists first in discourse becoming a fixed \nnotion through repetition, discursive and in practice, but also suggesting that discursive \npractices can be broken, revoked or challenged almost anytime, and anyplace. All three \nperspectives are useful to understanding the bodies of street youth, who are represented by \nthe media, public policy and everyday speech in ways reminiscent of Goffman, having \nattached to them a series of other attributes as a result. To some extent the youth perform to \nthese assigned roles or expectations, over and above the materiality of their poverty, drug \naddictions and violent behaviour. Although it would be stretching the point to claim that the \nyouth somehow switch on and off the performative presentation they do build a social space \nin which some bodily actions can challenge stigma. In so doing they are active in the \u2018social\u2019 \nconstruction of street youth and self identities (Goffman 1971). \n \nThese performances underscore how street youth bodies can be considered events, \nresources to their identity constructions, rather than objects. In \u2018doing looks\u2019, from manners \nof dress, use of tattoos, acquisition of neck chains, sunglasses and deportment, from \nslouching, \u2018hanging\u2019 to physicality of fights it is difficult to think of these as \u2018docile bodies\u2019 \nhabituated by regulations or subject positions. By the same token it is difficult, for us as \nresearchers, to consider the body as the effect of discourse when one is witness to beatings, \nself-harm, the presentation of mental illness and suicide. Thinking of street youth as an \n 23\nembodied experience is helpful, but how far can we consider the body as entirely worked \nout in discourse \u2013 a \u2018constitutive outside\u2019 as Butler has suggested (though not without \ncritique, see Budgeon 2003)? Our ethnographic enquiry sought to do no more than \nunderstand how young people, usually silenced in discussions of identity construction, \nspeak about their bodies and how they relate bodily practices to social relations. We have \nsuggested that street youth are able to understand their lives through a control of and \nidentification with their bodies. In some senses their actions speak louder than words \u2013 in \nhiding or publicising drug use, in resisting detainment or succumbing to beatings, to \ncomplaints of hunger but passing up offers of food. Speech can be limited, especially with \ndrugs; many conversations are short expletives of articulation or a few words mumbled, the \nmerest insight into \u2018what it means to live in the body of a street youth\u2019, much less the broader \nphilosophical questions. Nevertheless, they do describe how street youth bodies do not fit \nneatly the discourses of what bodies should be - the \u2018modern body\u2019 - and of what street youth \nbodies should be. Their bodies change at an astonishing speed through drug use, poor diets \non the street and weight gain off it, the sunburn from work and the lightening through \nconfinement, from fighting that brings beatings and stabbing, to tattoos and self-harm, and \nillness. They never, however, refer to themselves as \u2018street children\u2019 or street youth\u2019, except \nwhen in the presence of NGO workers or media, or in an attempt to deny these terms.21 \nTheir discourses show glimpses of giving different meanings to actions, events and images \nthat most people are content to take for granted.  \n \nBibliography \nArmstrong, D.
