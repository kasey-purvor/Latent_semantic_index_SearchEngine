This phenomenon has been observed in all\ninvestigated organisms, from bacteria to mammalian cells.\nIn eukaryotic cells, the phenomenon is called nonsense-\nmediated mRNA decay (NMD) and it seems to be an active\nmechanism that selectively destroys mRNAs carrying prema-\nture translation termination codons (PTCs) (reviewed in\nMaquat, 2004; Amrani et al, 2006; Muhlemann et al, 2008;\nBrogna and Wen, 2009). NMD requires active translation and\nspecific trans-acting factors. Three trans-acting factors are the\nevolutionary conserved proteins UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3;\ntypically deletion or silencing of the corresponding genes\nprevents NMD in all tested organisms (Maquat, 2004;\nAmrani et al, 2006; Muhlemann et al, 2008). Additional\nfactors have also been implicated in NMD in multicellular\norganisms (Maquat, 2004; Muhlemann et al, 2008). Perhaps\nNMD serves as an mRNA surveillance mechanism that\nprevents the synthesis of truncated proteins that potentially\ncould have toxic effects, but its full physiological importance\nis not yet clear. UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3 are not essential for\nviability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Caenorhabditis\nelegans (Culbertson et al, 1980; Hodgkin et al, 1989). Some\nNMD factors are essential for viability in other organisms\n(Medghalchi et al, 2001; Metzstein and Krasnow, 2006; Yoine\net al, 2006; Wittkopp et al, 2009); but it is not yet known\nwhether NMD or some other important function of these\nproteins is required for survival (Brumbaugh et al, 2004;\nAzzalin and Lingner, 2006; Azzalin et al, 2007; Luke et al,\n2007; Ajamian et al, 2008). A definite class of NMD substrates\nare immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor mRNAs that\nacquired PTCs as a consequence of V(D)J rearrangements\nduring lymphocyte maturation (Li and Wilkinson, 1998;\nMuhlemann et al, 2008). However, in the typical cell, the\nmain NMD substrates are probably abnormal transcripts that\nacquired PTCs as a consequence of errors during transcrip-\ntion or pre-mRNA processing (He et al, 1993; Jaillon et al,\n2008; Sayani et al, 2008). The discovery that unspliced pre-\nmRNAs accumulate in NMD mutants in S. cerevisiae and\nother organisms also suggests that NMD may have a proof-\nreading function in gene expression, eliminating transcripts\nthat have not been spliced due to suboptimal splice signals\n(Jaillon et al, 2008; Sayani et al, 2008).\nNMD is clearly linked to translation termination; the\nimportant question is how PTCs are distinguished from\nnormal stop codons. Surprisingly, in mammalian cells, the\ndistinction seems to be linked to splicing: strong mRNA\nreduction typically occurs when the nonsense mutation is\nlocated upstream of an intron (Carter et al, 1996; Thermann\net al, 1998; Zhang et al, 1998). Moreover, in some instances,\nthe artificial insertion of an intron downstream of a normal\nstop codon can make it behave like a PTC (Carter et al, 1996;\nThermann et al, 1998); similar observations were also\nreported in plants (Kerenyi et al, 2008). It is proposed that\nin these systems, the exon junction complex (EJC)\u2014a multi-\nprotein complex that is deposited on the mRNA during\nsplicing in the nucleus and remains associated with the\nmRNA during export to the cytoplasm\u2014mediates the link\nbetween splicing and NMD (Le Hir et al, 2001; Le Hir and\nSeraphin, 2008). The current model is that upon translation\ntermination, a downstream EJC promotes recruitment and\nactivation of UPF1 on the mRNA, initiating NMD (Kashima\net al, 2006; Chamieh et al, 2008). Stop codons located in the\nlast exon do not induce NMD, probably because the transla-\nting ribosome displaces the EJC before reaching the stop\ncodon. In addition to its function in NMD, the EJC is believed\nto be the important explanation for why pre-mRNA proce-\nssing impinges on later events such as subcellular mRNA\nReceived: 20 June 2009; accepted: 4 March 2010; published online:\n1 April 2010\n*Corresponding author.

However, the\nmechanism of mammalian NMD remains poorly understood;\nin fact, recent studies have reported examples of EJC-inde-\npendent NMD and have questioned that splicing and the EJC\nhave an important function in NMD (Buhler et al, 2006;\nEberle et al, 2008; Singh et al, 2008).\nIn S. cerevisiae, B4% of the genes have introns and there\nhas been no evidence of a link between PTC recognition and\nsplicing (Goffeau et al, 1996; Amrani et al, 2006). Instead, the\ncurrent view is that in this organism, the distance between\nPTC and the 30 end is the important determinant (Amrani\net al, 2006). This mechanism is conceptualized by the so-\ncalled faux (false) 30-UTR model, which says that premature\ntermination is intrinsically abnormal because it takes place\nfaraway from the normal 30 UTR, and this prevents the\nnormal interaction between cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding pro-\ntein (PABPC) and the terminating ribosome. Instead, it allows\nthe interaction with NMD factors that shunt the mRNA for\ndestruction (Amrani et al, 2004, 2006). The faux 30-UTR\nmodel might explain the observation that often PTCs\ntrigger strong NMD only when located early in the coding\nregion\u2014this polarity effect of NMD has been previously\nobserved in many organisms, including S. cerevisiae,\nSchizosaccharomyces pombe, C. elegans and Drosophila\nmelanogaster and Drosophila S2 cells (Losson and Lacroute,\n1979; Peltz et al, 1993; Brogna, 1999; Mendell et al, 2000;\nBehm-Ansmant et al, 2007; Longman et al, 2007). The faux\n30-UTR model might explain a number of NMD features in\nmammalian and Drosophila cells as well (Behm-Ansmant\net al, 2007; Eberle et al, 2008; Ivanov et al, 2008; Muhlemann\net al, 2008; Silva et al, 2008; Singh et al, 2008). However,\ncontrary to the prediction of the faux 30-UTR model, recent\nstudies have reported that neither the poly(A) tail nor PABPC\nare required for NMD in S. cerevisiae (Meaux et al, 2008). We\nhave argued that neither the faux 30-UTR nor the EJC model\nexplains all the available data satisfactorily in any organism\n(Brogna and Wen, 2009).\nHere, we have investigated the connection between NMD\nand splicing in S. pombe, in which some 43% of genes have\nintrons (Wood et al, 2002). We found that introns strongly\nenhance NMD, but contrary to the prediction of the EJC\nmodel, an intron enhanced NMD that was positioned either\nbefore or after the PTC and deletion of orthologs of EJC\ncomponents did not affect NMD. We found that it is the\nproximity of an intron to the PTC that triggers the mRNA\nreduction, indicating that the effect of pre-mRNA splicing on\nNMD is direct, not the secondary consequence of splicing\nenhancing mRNA translation. In the absence of introns, only\nPTCs located at the beginning of the gene caused NMD;\nhowever, against the faux 30-UTR model prediction, we\nfound only a modest correlation with the distance of the\nPTC from the 30 end.\nResults\nNMD depends on the position of the PTC along the\ncoding region\nTo investigate NMD, we generated GFP reporters with or\nwithout a PTC, under the control of the promoter (nmt41)\nand terminator of the nmt1 gene of S. pombe (Maundrell,\n1993). Three nonsense mutations were introduced in the\nopen reading frame (ORF) at codon positions 6, 27 and 140\n(Figure 1A). The plasmid constructs were transformed in a\nwild-type strain of S. pombe (Supplementary Table 1) and\nRNA levels were analysed by Northern blotting. A reduced\namount of mRNA was apparent with the PTC6 and PTC27\nreporters; however, the reporter with PTC140 showed mini-\nmal reduction (Figure 1B). The mRNA levels were restored in\nupf2D and upf1D strains, suggesting that the reduction is\ncaused by canonical NMD (Figure 1C and D).\nThe presence of the mutations probably lowered mRNA\nstability. We assessed this for the PTC6 mRNA. Trans-\ncript levels were assayed at regular time intervals after\nadding 1,10-phenanthroline to inhibit transcription. This\ndrug was used previously to inhibit transcription and to\nmeasure genome-wide mRNA stability in S. cerevisiae and\nS. pombe\u2014the effects of 1,10-phenanthroline were similar to\nusing rpb1-1, a temperature-sensitive allele of RNA polymer-\nase II (Rodriguez-Gabriel et al, 2003; Grigull et al, 2004;\nLackner et al, 2007). We found that the PTC6 mRNA decays\nfaster; however, the decay rate is not gradual like that of the\nPTC-less mRNA: it is initially faster but then becomes slower,\ncomparable to that of the control (Figure 1E and G). In upf2D\ncells, the PTC6 mRNA was stabilized, the decay kinetic was\nsimilar to that of the PTC-less mRNA in the wild-type strain\n(Figure 1G). Surprisingly, deletion of upf2 seems to stabilize\nthe PTC-less mRNA as well (Figure 1F and G). Therefore,\ndeletion of upf2 might also have a slight non-NMD-specific\nmRNA stabilization phenotype; this is not a feature peculiar\nto this mRNA reporter or organism: examples of PTC-less\nmRNAs that increase in level in NMD mutants have pre-\nviously been reported in other well-characterized NMD sys-\ntems (see Discussion). Moreover, the PTC-less reporter\nproduced more GFP in upf1D and upf2D cells than in wild\ntype (Figure 1H); the increase is reminiscent of the phenotype\nof loss-of-function mutations (photoshop mutations) in NMD\nfactors of D. melanogaster, which increase expression of GFP\nand other transgenes with no apparent NMD features\n(Metzstein and Krasnow, 2006).\nIn summary, in this system, NMD depends on the position\nof the PTC along the coding region and requires the core\nNMD components UPF1 and UPF2\u2014the system displays\nNMD features seen in other organisms.\nSplicing enhances NMD by an EJC-independent\nmechanism\nTo examine whether splicing affects NMD, we generated\nadditional reporters carrying an intron derived from the\nendogenous gene ubc4; the intron was inserted within\ncodon 110, approximately in the middle of the GFP-coding\nregion (Figure 2A). The intron is correctly spliced: an mRNA\nof the correct size is produced and GFP fluorescence is readily\ndetected in the PTC-less control (Figure 2B); splicing fidelity\nwas also verified by sequencing RT\u2013PCR-amplified cDNA\nclones of the coding region (data not shown). We found\nthat the mRNA level was drastically reduced in all PTC-\ncontaining reporters (Figure 2C). In particular, PTC140\ncaused a strong mRNA reduction, whereas the same mutation\nin the intron-less reporter caused only a minor decrease\n(Figure 2C versus 1B). The level of the PTC27 mRNA was\nalso lower than that seen with the intron-less reporters\n(Figure 2C versus 1B). In summary, all PTC mutations\nresulted in a strong mRNA reduction in the intron-containing\nreporters, regardless of the position along the coding region;\nIntron proximity enhances NMD in S. pombe\nJ Wen and S Brogna\nThe EMBO Journal VOL 29 | NO 9 | 2010 &2010 European Molecular Biology Organization1538\nthe presence of the intron abolished the \u2018polar\u2019 NMD pheno-\ntype seen with the intron-less constructs. Similarly to the\nintron-less reporters, mRNA levels were restored in the upf2D\nstrain (Figure 2D). Notably, the level of unspliced pre-RNA\nwas also increased in the upf2D strain, consistent with the\nview that NMD normally degrades transcripts that fail to be\nspliced (Figure 2D). Some pre-mRNA accumulation is also\napparent in wild-type cells; probably because the intron is not\nvery efficiently spliced. Notably, in wild-type cells, the level\nPTC6 pre-mRNA (Figure 2C, lane 2) is much lower than that\nwith PTC27 or PTC140 (lanes 3\u20134) or that of the control that\ncarries only intron-encoded PTCs (lane 1); this behavior\nsuggests that pre-mRNAs that fail to be spliced are rapidly\ndegraded if they carry an early PTC, because like PTC6 they\nA\nwtB C upf2\u0002\n1 2 3 4\n100 16\u00b17 43\u00b14 82\u00b120\nW\nT PT\nC6\nPT\nC2\n7\nPT\nC1\n40\nW\nT PT\nC6\nPT\nC2\n7\nPT\nC1\n40\nW\nT\nPT\nC6\nPT\nC2\n7\nPT\nC1\n40\n100 73\u00b16 67\u00b19 65\u00b112 103\u00b1785\u00b18 114\u00b113% %\n1 243\nPTC27 PTC140PTC6\nGFP\nWT\nPTC6\nPTC27\nPTC140\nE \n0 2 10 20 40 60  (min)\nWT\nPTC6\nnmt41 \nprom\nnmt1 \nterm\nF \n0 2 10 20 40 60  (min)\nD upf1\u0002\n1 2 3 4 2 3 41\nGFP\n18S rRNA\nGFP\nRpl32\nG \nGFP\n18S rRNA\nwt upf2\u0002\nWT\nPTC6\nGFP\n18S rRNA\nGFP\n18S RNA\n100%\nm\nR\nN\nA \nle\nve\nl\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n10 20 40 60 (min)\nWT in wt\nPTC6 in wt\nWT in upf2\u0002 \nPTC6 in upf 2\u0002\n2\nDIC\nGFP\nfluorescence\nWT\nin wt\nPTC6\nin wt\nWT\nin upf2\u0002 \nWT\nin upf1\u0002\nH \nFigure 1 NMD depends on PTC position.

In several Northern\nblots, we found more pre-mRNA accumulation with the\nPTC27 and PTC140 reporters than with the PTC-less control\n(for example in Figure 2C and D), its significance remains to\nbe investigated.\nTo assess whether the effect of splicing on NMD depends\non whether the reporters are expressed from plasmids or from\nsingle copy chromosomal genes, we integrated the constructs\nat the leu1 locus in both wild-type and upf2D strains. As for\nplasmid expression, we found that NMD was strongly\nenhanced in the intron-containing reporters (Figure 2E); and\nmRNA levels were restored in the upf2D strain (Figure 2F).\nThe integrated reporters produce about 10-fold less mRNA\nthan plasmid expression; thus NMD efficiency does not seem\nto depend on substrate level\u2014the NMD capacity of the cell\nprobably is not affected by high substrate levels; in agreement\nwith this view, we found that NMD is efficient also when a\nreporter is expressed with a promoter that yields seven to\neight times more mRNA than the plasmid reporters we have\nused throughout this study (see Supplementary Figure 2).\nNext, we tested whether splicing affects NMD in the\nendogenous gene ypt3 (SPAC18G6.03). This evolutionary\nconserved gene contains two introns in the middle of the\ncoding region. Three nonsense mutations were introduced at\neither codon 6, 131 or 183 (Figure 3A). We found that all\nmutations reduced the mRNA level (Figure 3B and C) and the\nreduction was clearly suppressed in the upf2D strain (Figure\n3D and E). To test whether the introns are required for the\nmRNA reduction, we generated similar constructs with a\ncDNA version of the gene (Figure 3A, bottom panel). We\nfound that such PTC-containing mRNAs were only modestly\nreduced; the PTC6 mRNA was reduced to about 50% of the\nPTC-less control, but the PTC131 and PTC183 mRNAs were\nreduced by only 16 and 21%, respectively (Figure 3B, lanes\n1\u20133 versus 4\u20136; and Figure 3C, lanes 1\u20132 versus 3\u20134). In the\nupf2D strain, the levels of PTC131 and PTC183 mRNAs were\nincreased, but that of PTC6 was not affected. The data further\nindicate that mRNAs derived from intron-less reporters are\nnot subjected to NMD as much as spliced mRNAs.\nTo further examine the function of splicing in NMD, we\nmutated the 50 splicing site (ss) of the intron from GUAG to\nAUAA in our GFP reporters (Figure 4A). The mutation\nabolished splicing almost completely, resulting in the accu-\nmulation of a larger transcript of the expected size (Figure 4B,\nlanes 5\u20138)\u2014four putative cryptic 50 ss located very close to\nthe 50 end probably account for the weak band migrating as\nthe spliced GFP mRNA.

The retention of the intron gives rise to addi-\ntional intron-encoded PTCs (the first of which is embedded in\nthe mutated 50 ss); therefore, in the PTC140 reporter, the\nearliest PTC is actually at position 111. It is feasible that the\nunspliced transcripts escape NMD because they are retained\nin the nucleus (Legrain and Rosbash, 1989). To investigate\nthe issue further, we assayed the subcellular distribution of\nthe RNAs by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). We\nfound that the unspliced RNA with the mutated 50 ss accu-\nmulates throughout the cell, similar to the fully spliced\nmRNA (Figure 4C).\nGiven that the PTC140 mutation is located downstream of\nthe intron, it is probably not the EJC that enhances NMD. We\nare not aware of any experimental evidence that suggests that\nsplicing deposits an EJC in S. pombe. However, the genome of\nthis organism contains orthologs of some EJC components:\nwe identified the core proteins MAGO, eIF4AIII and RNPS1,\nwhereas the putative Y14 homolog lacks the well-conserved\nN-terminal domain found in other organisms and MLN51 is\nmissing altogether (Supplementary Figure 1; Fribourg et al,\n2003). RNAi depletion or mutations of EJC components\nstabilize PTC-containing mRNAs in mammalian cells\n(Lykke-Andersen et al, 2001; Gehring et al, 2003, 2005;\nShibuya et al, 2004). However, we analysed MAGO and\nRNPS1 deletion mutants and found that neither affected\nNMD: the levels of the PTC-containing mRNAs were reduced\nas in the wild-type strain (Figure 4D and E). We fail to\nknockout eIF4AIII; the gene is probably essential like in\nother organisms (Palacios et al, 2004).\nThe distance between PTC and intron determines NMD\nefficiency\nAs mentioned in Introduction, it has been reported that the\ninsertion of an intron in the 30 UTR can make the normal stop\ncodon behave like a PTC, causing a strong mRNA reduction,\nwhich requires NMD factors. To assess whether this applies\nto S. pombe, we inserted an intron just after the normal GFP\nstop codon (Figure 5A). This caused strong mRNA reduction\nin the PTC-less reporter with just the GFP stop codon; but\nsurprisingly, no further reduction in the reporters with PTC27\nand PTC140, compared with the corresponding intro-less\nWT\nPTC6\nPTC131\nPTC183PTC131\nnmt41 \nprom\nA\nB C\nD E\nnmt1 \nterm\nPTC6 PTC183\nPTC131PTC6\nW\nT\nPT\nC6\nPT\nC1\n31\ncW\nT\ncP\nTC\n6\ncP\nTC\n13\n1\nIntron No intron\n1\n100\n2\n19\u00b13\n3\n24\u00b15\n4\n100\n5\n57\u00b19\n6\n84\u00b16\nW\nT\nPT\nC6\nPT\nC1\n31\ncW\nT\ncP\nTC\n6\ncP\nTC\n13\n1\nIntron No intron\n1\n100\n2\n69\n3\n94\n4\n100\n5\n59\n6\n115\nwt\nupf2\u0394\nypt3\nRpl32\nypt3\nRpl32\ncWT\ncPTC6\ncPTC131\ncPTC183PTC183\nW\nT\nPT\nC1\n83\ncW\nT\ncP\nTC\n18\n3\nIntron No\n intron\nwt\n1\n100\n2\n27\u00b111\n3\n100\n4\n79\u00b114\n1\n100\n2\n71\n3\n100\n4\n97\nW\nT\nPT\nC1\n83\ncW\nT\ncP\nTC\n18\n3\nIntron Nointron\nupf2\u0394\nYPT3\nYPT3-cDNA\n% %\n% %\nFigure 3 Introns are necessary for strong NMD in the ypt3 gene.

The mRNA levels\nwere restored in the upf2D strain (Figure 5C). We reasoned\nthat the PTC27 and PTC140 transcripts were not affected\nprobably because the mutations are too far from the\nintron\u2014the PTC27 transcript is more affected than PTC140\nmost likely because it is more sensitive to splicing-indepen-\ndent NMD, like we have seen for mRNAs that have not\nundergone splicing (Figure 1B). On the basis of these results,\nwe reasoned that splicing could perhaps affect NMD only\nwhen termination occurs close to the splice site. To test this\npossibility further, we inserted a spacer between stop codon\nand intron in a reporter with a 30-UTR intron (Figure 5D, this\nreporter is slightly different from that shown in 5A, see figure\nlegend). We found that the 30-UTR intron causes strong NMD\nwhen close to the stop codon, as before (Figure 5E and F);\ninstead, in the reporter with the insert we found that the\nmRNA level is partially restored (5E, lane 2 versus 4)\u2014in this\nexperiment, the mRNA levels were also estimated by real-\ntime RT\u2013PCR, which confirmed that the mRNA with the\nspacer is about 2.5-fold more abundant (see Supplementary\nWT WT-ivs WT-\nmut.ivs\nPTC27-\nmut.ivs Control\nGFP\nPTC6 PTC27 PTC140\nW\nT-i\nvs\nPT\nC6\n-iv\ns\nPT\nC2\n7-\nivs\nPT\nC1\n40\n-\nivs\nW\nTm\nut\n.iv\ns\nPT\nC6\nmu\nt.iv\ns\nPT\nC2\n7m\nut\n.iv\ns\nPT\nC1\n40\nmu\nt.iv\ns\nIntron Mut. intron\n1\n100%\n2\n17\u00b15\n3\n25\u00b111\n4\n20\u00b17\n5\n100\n6\n23\u00b14\n7\n47\u00b18\n8\n101\u00b114\nUnspliced\n mRNA\nGFP\nRpl32\nDIC\nCy3\nnmt41\nprom\nA\nB\nC\nD E\nnmt1\nterm5\u2032ss\nWTmut.ivs\nPTC6mut.ivs\nPTC27mut.ivs\nPTC140mut.ivs\n1\n100%\n2\n21\u00b13\n3\n27\u00b111\n4\n20\u00b14\nW\nT-i\nvs\nPT\nC6\n-iv\ns\nPT\nC2\n7-i\nvs\nPT\nC1\n40\n-iv\ns\nPre-mRNA\nGFP\nRpl32\nrnps1\u0394\nW\nT-i\nvs\nPT\nC6\n-iv\ns\nPT\nC2\n7-i\nvs\nPT\nC1\n40\n-iv\ns\nmago\u0394\n1\n100%\n2\n20\u00b13\n3\n33\u00b17\n4\n21\u00b16\nPre-mRNA\nGFP\nRpl32\nFigure 4 Intron-dependent NMD requires splicing but not the EJC.

In agreement with the mRNA quantifications, the\nreporter with the spacer yields more GFP (Figure 5G, compare\nWT-30ivs and WT-147-3ivs), suggesting that lengthening the\ndistance between stop codon and intron not only suppresses\nNMD, but it also does so without impairing steady-state\ntranslation efficiency.\nTo further assess the importance of the distance between\nintron and PTC, in another construct, we have moved the\nintron to the very beginning of the GFP-coding region\n(Figure 6A, bottom diagram). We found that at this position\n(417 nt from the PTC) the intron does not enhance NMD of\nthe PTC140 mRNA\u2014yet the intron is spliced very efficiently,\nwe see no pre-mRNA accumulation (Figure 6B, lane 6 versus\n8). In addition, we tested whether artificial lengthening of the\ndistance between the intron and the PTC prevents NMD in the\ninitial reporter with the intron before the PTC (PTC140-ivs).\nWe inserted either a 147-bp or a 291-bp fragment between the\nintron and PTC140 (Figure 6C). We expected the 147-bp\ninsertion to partially prevent NMD and the 291-bp to restore\nthe mRNA level to that of the PTC-less control\u2014the 291-bp\ninsertion places PTC140 at a similar distance from the intron\nas in the reporter with a 30-UTR intron (PTC140-30ivs), which\nwas not subjected to NMD. We found that both insertions\nsuppress NMD; in particular, the 147-bp insertion restored\nthe mRNA level about two-fold, whereas the 291-bp insertion\nrecovered the mRNA level almost to that of the PTC-less\ncontrol (Figure 6D). The insertion of these spacers in the PTC-\nless reporter did not noticeably change the mRNA level,\narguing against the inserts per se having major effects on\ntranscription or processing. Moreover, the mRNAs protein\nyields were either comparable or increased, suggesting that\nthe insertions also do not inhibit translation (Figure 6E).\nThus, NMD reduction is probably not due to less efficient\nsteady-state translation of the mRNAs with the insertions.\n1\n100%\n2\n17\u00b15\n3\n25\u00b111\n4\n20\u00b17\n5\n24\u00b16\n6\n22\u00b14\n7\n44\u00b111\n8\n85\u00b112\n1\n100%\n2\n76\n3\n83\n4\n101\nW\nT-i\nvs\nPT\nC6\n-iv\ns\nPT\nC2\n7-i\nvs\nPT\nC1\n40\n-iv\ns\nW\nT-3\n\u2032iv\ns\nPT\nC6\n-3\u2032\nivs\nPT\nC2\n7-3\n\u2032iv\ns\nPT\nC1\n40\n-3\u2032\nivs\nW\nT-3\n\u2032iv\ns\nPT\nC6\n-3\u2032\nivs\nPT\nC2\n7-3\n\u2032iv\ns\nPT\nC1\n40\n-3\u2032\nivs\nORF\nintron\n3\u2032-UTR\nintron\n3\u2032-UTR\nintron\nupf2\u0394\nwt\nGFP\nRpl32\nPTC27 PTC140PTC6\nGFP\nnmt41\nprom\nA D\nE\nG\nF\nB\nC\nnmt1\nterm3\u2032-UTR \nintron\nWT-3\u2032ivs\nPTC6-3\u2032ivs\nPTC27-3\u2032ivs\nPTC140-3\u2032ivs\nGFP\nRpl32\nGFP\nWT-3\u2032ivs\nWT-147-3\u2032ivs\n147bp\n1\n100\n2\n16\u00b14\n3\n100\n4\n37\u00b111\n1\n100\n2\n80\u00b19\n3\n100\n4\n61\u00b112\nW\nT \nW\nT-3\n\u2032iv\ns \nW\nT-1\n47\n \nW\nT-1\n47\n-3\n\u2032iv\ns\nW\nT \nW\nT-3\n\u2032iv\ns\nW\nT-1\n47\n \nW\nT-1\n47\n-3\n\u2032iv\ns \nwt upf2\u0394\nGFP\nRpl32\nWT \n(30 ms)\nWT-3\u2032ivs\n (60 ms)\nGFP\nnmt41\nprom WT\nWT-147\n147bp\nWT-147\n(60 ms)\nWT-147-3\u2032ivs\n(60 ms)\nDIC\nFluorescence\nnmt1\nterm\nFigure 5 A 30-UTR intron induces stronger NMD when it is closer to the stop codon.

In\nagreement with the western blotting result, we found that the\nreporters with the inserts (WTivs147-LUC and WTivs291-\nLUC) are not translated less efficiently than the reporters\nwithout (Figure 6G). Thus, the insertions do not suppress\nNMD indirectly, by inhibiting steady-state translation for\nexample. Surprisingly, we also found that the presence of\nan intron in the middle of GFP appreciably reduced transla-\ntion efficiency rather than enhancing it (Figure 6G).\nTherefore, we conclude that the effects of splicing on NMD\nare probably direct despite being EJC independent and that\nsplicing enhances NMD more when the intron is close to\nthe PTC.\nThe distance of the PTC from the 3 0 end and the nature\nof the 3 0 UTR do not greatly affect NMD\nThe faux 30-UTR model predicts that NMD should increase\nwith the distance of the PTC from the 30 end.

Lengthening the 30 UTR by 102\nbases should make PTC27 behave like PTC6, enhancing\nNMD, whereas lengthening the 30 UTR by 418 bases would\ntrigger NMD of the PTC140 transcript; the insertion places the\nmutation at the same distance from the 30 end as PTC6 in the\noriginal reporter. We found that the 102-base insertion repro-\nducibly enhanced NMD of the mRNA with PTC27 (Figure 7B,\nlane 3 versus 7), but did not affect that with PTC6 (lane 2\nversus 6). Surprisingly, the level of the PTC140 mRNA was\nconstantly higher than that with the original 30 UTR rather\nthan being reduced (Figure 7B, lane 4 versus 8). In the\nreporters with the 418-base insertion, we found that the\nmRNA without PTCs was reduced to about 63% of that\nwith the normal 30 UTR (Figure 7C); the mRNA level was\nrestored in the upf2D strain (Figure 7D), consistent with the\nview that mRNAs with artificially long 30 UTR become NMD\nsubstrates. However, we found no linear relationship\nbetween mRNA levels and distance of the PTC from the 30\nend. For example, it was expected that the 418-bp insertion\nwould make PTC140 behave like PTC6 in the initial reporter,\ntriggering strong NMD. Instead, we found that the PTC140\nmRNA level was only half of that of the reporter with the\noriginal 30 UTR (Figure 7C, lane 1 versus 5), and it was barely\nreduced relative to the PTC-less control (Figure 7C, lane 2\nversus 5). To further assess to what extent the distance from\nthe 30 end determines NMD, we inserted an in-frame 402 bp\nfragment just before the normal stop codon (Figure 7A)\u2014we\nreasoned that an insertion in the coding region is less likely to\ninfluence mRNA stability features that might be present in the\noriginal 30 UTR. We found that PTCs at positions 6 and 27\ncaused as strong NMD as in the earlier reporters. However,\nthe PTC140 mRNA was only modestly reduced, even though\nthe PTC is at the same distance from the 30 end as the NMD\ninducing PTC6 was in the constructs with the original 30 UTR\n(Figure 7E and F).\nWe also investigated whether the sequence of the 30 UTR\naffects NMD. We generated reporter constructs in which the\nnmt41 terminator sequencer was replaced by that of either\nthe ade6 or adh gene. The ade6 30 UTR was selected because\nit has been previously reported that nonsense mutations in\nthe ade6 gene cause strong NMD, indicating that the 30 UTR\nof this gene is NMD permissive (Mendell et al, 2000). The\nother 30 UTR was selected because the adh gene is highly\nPTC27 PTC140PTC6\nPTC6\nGFP\n102bp\nPTC27 PTC140\nGFP\n418bp GFP-418\nPTC27 PTC140PTC6\nGFP\n402bp\nGF\nP\nPT\nC6\nPT\nC2\n7\nPT\nC1\n40\nNo inserts\nGF\nP\nPT\nC6\nPT\nC2\n7\nPT\nC1\n40\n102 bp\nGFP-102\nGFP\nRpl32\n1\n100%\n2\n16\u00b17\n3\n43\u00b14\n4\n82\u00b120\n5\n112\u00b117\n6\n18\u00b15\n7\n27\u00b17  \n8\n107\u00b112\n2\n63\u00b111\n3\n16\u00b17   \n4\n24\u00b15\n5\n53\u00b114\nGFP\n402 bp\nW\nT\nPT\nC6\nPT\nC2\n7\nPT\nC1\n40\n1\n100%\n2\n13\u00b14\n3\n27\u00b15\n4\n67\u00b111\n1\n100%\n2\n89\u00b111\n3\n102\u00b19\n4\n91\u00b112\n402 bp\nW\nT\nPT\nC6\nPT\nC2\n7\nPT\nC1\n40\nwt\nGFP-402\nRpl32\nRpl32\nW\nT\nPT\nC6\nPT\nC2\n7\nPT\nC1\n40\nW\nT\n1\n100%\n2\n91\u00b111\n3\n87\u00b16\n4\n97\u00b19\n5\n101\u00b116\nW\nT\nPT\nC6\nPT\nC2\n7\nPT\nC1\n40\n1\n100%\nW\nT\nwt\n418 bp\nW\nT-i\nvs\nPT\nC6\n-\nivs\nPT\nC2\n7-\nivs\nPT\nC1\n40\n-\nivs\nW\nT\nPT\nC6\nPT\nC1\n40\nPT\nC2\n7\nNo intron Intron\n1\n100%\n2\n16\u00b13\n3\n24\u00b14\n4\n79\u00b19\n5\n100\n6\n17\u00b19\n7\n20\u00b15\n8\n24\u00b16\nGFP\nRpl32\npab1\u0394\nupf2\u0394\nupf2\u0394\n418 bp\nWT-102\nPTC6-102\nPTC27-102\nPTC140-102\nWT-418\nPTC6-418\nPTC27-418\nPTC140-418\nWT-402\nPTC6-402\nPTC27-402\nPTC140-402\nnmt41\nprom\nA C\nE\nG\nD\nF\nB\nFigure 7 Lengthening the 30 UTR and lack of PABPC only modestly affect NMD.

We found the levels of the PTC6 and PTC27 mRNA\nwere reduced, but the PTC140 mRNA was not: the same\npattern seen with the reporters carrying the nmt1 30 UTR\n(Figure 2E and F, and data not shown).\nWe also assessed whether NMD is affected by PABPC, as\npredicted by the original faux 30-UTR model (Amrani et al,\n2004). We found that PTCs induced mRNA reduction in the\npab1D strain as they did in the wild-type strain (Figure 7G).\npab1 is the only PABC homolog in the genome of S. pombe\nbut is not essential.\nWe conclude that there is not a clear correlation between\nNMD and distance of the PTC from the mRNA 30 end, which\ncould be predictive of how much premature translation\ntermination will affect the mRNA level. We also conclude\nthat PABPC is not necessary for NMD in fission yeast.\nDiscussion\nIt has been reported that nonsense mutations located at the\nbeginning of the S. pombe ADE6 gene induce NMD even\nthough the gene does not have introns (Mendell et al, 2000).\nHere, we have also found that PTCs can induce strong NMD\nin intron-less reporter genes, but only when located at the\nbeginning of the coding region, whereas PTCs in the second\nhalf of the coding region do not induce strong NMD. We\ndiscovered that in the presence of a nearby intron, PTCs also\ncause strong NMD when located in the second half of the\ngene. In addition, inserting an intron in the 30 UTR made the\nnormal stop codon behave like a PTC and caused a strong\nmRNA reduction, as previously reported in mammalian\nsystems (Carter et al, 1996; Thermann et al, 1998). Similarly,\nwe found that removal of the introns from an endogenous gene\ndrastically reduced NMD, arguing that introns are likely to\nhave a general function in S. pombe NMD.\nThese results initially suggested the involvement of the\nEJC, as in mammalian cells. However, contrary to the pre-\ndiction of the EJC model, the intron enhanced NMD when\npositioned either before or after the PTC. Moreover, NMD was\nnot affected by deletion of the orthologs of the EJC compo-\nnents MAGO and RNPS1\u2014of which MAGO seems to be a\ncore component (Chamieh et al, 2008). Although we cannot\nexclude that eIF4AIII alone can assemble an EJC-like complex\nin S. pombe, this is unlikely: in S. cerevisiae there is a protein\nvery similar to eIF4AIII yet no evidence of an EJC\n(Supplementary Figure 1). The absence of an MLN51 homo-\nlog also argues against the formation of a stable EJCs in\nS. pombe\u2014this protein is probably necessary to stabilize the\nEJC on the RNA in mammalian cells (Le Hir and Andersen,\n2008). In addition, as the intron also stimulated NMD when\npositioned before the PTC, we conclude that the EJC model\ncannot explain why splicing enhances NMD in fission yeast.\nIt is difficult to explain how the ribosome could recognize the\nPTC without scanning through preceding exon junctions, the\nribosome tunnel through which the mRNA moves is just large\nenough to accommodate naked single-stranded RNA, so that\nthe mRNA is stripped off before scanning (Yusupova et al,\n2001). Similar results have been reported for the b-globin\ngene in mammalian cells: it was observed that an upstream\nintron is required for NMD when downstream introns are\nabsent (Matsuda et al, 2007). However, this mode of NMD\nseems to require some of the EJC proteins, RNPS1 was also\ndispensable (Matsuda et al, 2007).\nAn alternative explanation for why introns enhance NMD\nmight be that spliced mRNAs are translated more efficiently\nand as a result PTCs are recognized more frequently, enhancing\nNMD indirectly. This view is based on several studies that\nhave reported that splicing can enhance translation (Nott\net al, 2003, 2004; Wiegand et al, 2003; Sanford et al, 2004; Ma\net al, 2008; Michlewski et al, 2008). In particular, it has been\nreported that strengthening of splice signals enhances both\ntranslation and NMD, whereas mutations that weakened\nsplicing have the opposite effect (Gudikote et al, 2005). It\nhas been suggested that the EJC enhances initiation of the\nfirst pioneer round of translation directly, but the efficiency of\nthe first round might positively affect subsequent rounds and\nsteady-state translation (Ishigaki et al, 2001; Ma et al, 2008).\nSplicing might also enhance translation in S. cerevisiae and in\nother yeast species including S. pombe (Juneau et al, 2006;\nMan and Pilpel, 2007); however, we have found that splicing\nslightly decreases translation yield of our reporters rather\nthan enhancing it.\nNotably, we found that splicing enhances NMD only when\nthe PTC is not more than 240 bases away from the intron\n(Figure 8A). Reporters in which we have artificially increased\nthe distance between intron and PTC are no longer subjected\nto NMD, yet our control experiments indicate that steady-\nstate translation efficiency is not affected. Similarly, length-\nening the distance between stop codon and a 30-UTR intron\nsuppresses NMD but clearly not translation yield. These data\nindicate that pre-mRNA splicing impinges on NMD directly,\nyet they exclude that an EJC-like protein complex mediates\nthe effect. Although we still postulate that proteins that\nremain associated with the mRNA after splicing influence\nNMD, we propose that the effect is not due to a specific factor\ndeposited at a particular distance before the splice junction\n(Le Hir et al, 2000, 2001). Instead, we postulate that splicing\nsimply changes the composition or conformation of the\nmRNP at either side of the junction, and that the local\nmRNP structure influences translation termination or the\nrelease of the post-termination ribosome when the PTC is\nnear but not when it is at a distance from the splice region\n(Figure 8B). The model predicts that NMD occurs because\nsuch perturbations on the ribosome destabilize the mRNP,\npossibly by preventing establishment of a stable translation\ncircuit as suggested earlier (Brogna and Wen, 2009). It is also\npossible that there are connections between the spliced\nregion and mRNP components outside the coding region,\nwhich could affect the local mRNP; some of the physical\ninteractions of splicing with capping and 30-end formation,\nwhich occur during pre-mRNA processing, may be main-\ntained in the mature mRNP (Proudfoot et al, 2002). In\nparticular, interactions between cap-binding complex (CBC)\nand splicing have been reported in S. cerevisiae (Colot et al,\n1996; Fortes et al, 1999). Notably the yeast CBC can\ninteract with the translation initiation factor eIF4G, and the\nCBP80 subunit of CBC has structural similarity with eIF4G\n(Fortes et al, 2000; Marintchev and Wagner, 2005); further-\nmore, in mammalian cells, NMD substrates are prefer-\nentially associated with CBC rather than the translation\ninitiation factor eIF4E (Ishigaki et al, 2001). In summary,\nwe propose that splicing enhances NMD because it influ-\nences the structure of the mRNP around the spliced region\n(the mRNP inisotropy model, Figure 8B). An important\nassumption of the model is that such anisotropy in\nIntron proximity enhances NMD in S. pombe\nJ Wen and S Brogna\nThe EMBO Journal VOL 29 | NO 9 | 2010 &2010 European Molecular Biology Organization1546\nmRNP composition and structure is only transient; the\nprediction is that splicing might only enhance NMD of\nnewly synthesized transcripts before disassociation of the\n\u2018processing\u2019 factors. Instead\u2014provided that the PTC is in\na region not subjected to splicing-independent NMD\u2014the\ntranscripts are stable afterward. The observation that stea-\ndy-state mRNA is immune to splicing-dependent NMD in\nmammalian cells is in agreement with this model (reviewed\nin Maquat, 2004).\nOur data clearly indicate that splicing enhances NMD in\nS. pombe. However, PTCs at the beginning of the coding region\ncan trigger strong NMD also in genes without introns; simi-\nlarly to what has been reported in other systems. Do these\nobservations indicate that there are two separate NMD me-\nchanisms? Given that deletion of UPF1 and UPF2 suppresses\nNMD in both cases, the process is probably not entirely dis-\ntinct. However, the genetic analysis alone may be misleading\nbecause NMD mutants might have a nonspecific mRNA\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n0 100 200 300 400 (nt)\n3\u20325\u2032\nSTOP\nCBC\nR3\nR1\nR3\nR1\nSplice junction\n0 +240\u2013240\nSplicing affected region\n\u201390 +90\nNMD\nJunction\u2013PTC distance\nN\nM\nD\n e\nnh\na\nn\nce\nm\ne\nn\nt \n(nt)\n(+)(+)\nUnstable mRNP\nmRNP anisotropy affects pioneer translation\nIntron proximity enhances NMDA\nB\nA AAAAAAAAA\nAA\nAA\nAAAA\n?\nPolyA\ncomplex\nFigure 8 The mRNP anisotropy model.

(B) Local mRNP anisotropy triggers splice-\ndependent NMD. Pre-mRNA splicing deposits proteins around either side of the splice junction. These proteins remain associated with the\nmRNA and change the mRNP local configuration, which in turn affect translation termination or the fate of the post-termination ribosome (e.g.\nribosome release). The proteins remain associated with the mRNA only transiently, possibly until the first round of translation. The local mRNP\nconfiguration involves interactions of the splice region with the cap-binding complex (CBC) and other proteins associated with the 30 end.\nWhite ovals are nonspecific mRNA-binding proteins; black circles are proteins deposited by splicing.

This is not an\nidiosyncrasy of our experimental system, similar observa-\ntions have previously been reported in Drosophila, both in\ncell culture and in flies (Gatfield et al, 2003; Metzstein and\nKrasnow, 2006); examples of over-stabilization of control\nPTC-less mRNAs upon knockdown of NMD factors were\nalso reported in mammalian cells yet not explained (Figures\n1 and 4; Eberle et al, 2008). Furthermore, early studies in\nbudding yeast also reported cases of over-stabilization of\nwild-type mRNAs in UPF1 mutants (Table 1 in Peltz et al,\n1994). In addition, microarray expression studies have clearly\nindicated that mRNAs with no obvious NMD features are also\nstabilized in NMD mutants (Rehwinkel et al, 2005).\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the two mRNA reduction\nmechanisms are similar just because lack of UPF1 or UPF2\nsuppresses them both. Generally, NMD is viewed as a single\nwell-defined biochemical process, which similar to other\ncellular mechanisms, should be conserved across organisms.\nAgainst this view, there are cases in which UPF2 and UPF3\nare not required for NMD (Gehring et al, 2005; Chan et al,\n2007). On the basis of these conflicting observations, it is\nplausible that the nonsense-mediated mRNA reduction, typi-\ncally attributed to NMD, is in fact the compound effect of\ndiverse mechanisms that destroy mRNPs that are not effi-\nciently translated (Brogna and Wen, 2009).\nFinally, in agreement with earlier studies, we also found\ncases in which lengthening of the 30 UTR induced an UPF1\/\nUPF2-dependent reduction of the mRNA. However, against\nthe faux 30-UTR model prediction, we found no clear correla-\ntion with the distance of the PTC from the 30 end (we also\nfound no correlation with the distance from the 50 end, data\nnot shown). Furthermore, we found that PABPC is not\nrequired for NMD of either spliced or unspliced mRNAs, in\nagreement with the report that neither the poly(A) tail nor\nPABPC are required for NMD in S. cerevisiae (Meaux et al,\n2008). Our data argue against the notion that it is a long\ndistance from either the 30 or 50 end, which primarily triggers\nsplicing-independent NMD; instead the data suggest that\nsome sequence elements flanking the PTC might affect\nNMD; this view is in agreement with earlier studies in S.\ncerevisiae, which concluded that downstream sequence ele-\nments located after the PTC modulate NMD (Peltz et al, 1993;\nZhang et al, 1995). In conclusion, the studies presented here\nclearly establish that current models cannot explain NMD\nin S. pombe, future work shall investigate the molecular\nmechanisms and establish if NMD is different in this organ-\nism or whether existing models are generally not accurate.\nMaterials and methods\nPlasmid constructs\nThe GFP reporters were generated by cloning the GFP-coding region\ninto the BamH1 sites of the pREP41 plasmid vector. The GFP\nfragment was amplified from pRS316-GFP, which contains the\noriginal S65T GFP, accession number: BD062761 (Heim et al, 1995;\nKuperwasser et al, 2004). Mutations were introduced by overlapping\nPCR. The intron in the WT-ivs constructs derives from the ubc4 gene,\nwhich was amplified from S. pombe genomic DNA and inserted into\nthe PmlI site located at position 328 in the GFP-coding region, by\nblunt-end ligation. The WT-30ivs constructs carry the same intron as\nabove, cloned in the XmaI site, which is located 9-bases after the GFP\nstop codon. The WT-102 and WT-418 constructs were generated by\ninserting 102 and 418 bp DNA fragment in the Xma I site, as above.\nThe fragments correspond to overlapping regions of the firefly\nluciferase gene; they were amplified using primers:\n50-AACGACCCGGGCTGAATACAAATCACA-30 (F-luc.sense)\n50-ATATTCCCGGGCGCAACTGCAACTCC-30 (102 bp.reverse)\n50-ACTATCCCGGGCCACACCCTTAGGTAACC-30 (418 bp.reverse)\nThe WT-402 constructs were generated by inserting 402 bp DNA\nfragment into an AvrII site (introduced by PCR) located 6 bp before\nthe native stop codon.

The fragments were PCR amplified\nfrom EGFP (pEGFP-C3, CLONTECH) using primers:\n50-CTTGAGCCTAGGTACCCATACGATGTTCCTGA-30 (EGFP.sense),\n50-TTGGTTCCTAGGGGTCAGGGTGGTCACGAG-30 (EGFP291 bp.\nreverse),\n50-TTTGTACCTAGGCTCGACCAGGATGGGCAC-30 (EGFP147 bp.\nreverse).\nThe WT-147-30ivs construct was generated by inserting a 147 bp\nfragment in an AvrII site located immediately downstream of the\nnormal stop codon in a derivative of WT-30ivs; the AvrII site was\nintroduced by PCR. The GFP-luciferase fusion constructs were\ngenerated by joining the GFP and firefly luciferase sequences by\noverlapping PCR, followed by cloning of the fusion PCR fragments\ninto the Bam HI site in pREP41, as above. The WT-50ivs was\ngenerated by inserting the intron sequence into an AvrII site\n(introduced by PCR) located immediately downstream of ATG. All\nplasmids were verified by sequencing and restriction digestion.\nTransformation, gene disruption and plasmid integration\nFission yeast transformations were as described earlier with minor\nmodifications (Okazaki et al, 1990). Yeast cultures were grown to 1\nOD600, washed with water and resuspended in lithium acetate\nbuffer; 1 mg plasmids or 10mg PCR products were mixed with 20mg\nssDNA and added to 100ml of cells and incubated at room\ntemperature for 30 min. Later, 260ml of 50% PEG4000 were added\nand incubated for a further 60 min at 301C, followed by heat shock\nat 421C for 30 min. The RNPS1 homolog was deleted by\nhomologous recombination using a PCR-amplified fragment con-\ntaining the kanMX6 cassette, flanked targeting sequences (Bahler\net al, 1998).

Plasmid integration was as described earlier using the\npDUAL multicopy vector (Matsuyama et al, 2004). Briefly, the\nGFP reporters were cloned into the BamH1 site of pDUAL1.\nPlasmids constructs were linearized by SacI digestion and\ntransformed into either the wild-type or upf2D strain. Recombinants\nwere selected EMM plates lacking leucine.\nRNA extraction and RNA analysis\nTotal RNA was extracted with hot acid phenol as described (Ausubel\net al, 1996); typically from 10 ml cell cultures grown to 1 OD600. The\nRNA was separated on 1.2% agarose gels in the presence of\nformaldehyde. The RNA was transferred by overnight capillary\ntransfer onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, GE Healthcare) and\nhybridized with random-primer 32P-labelled probes as described\n(Yang et al, 1993). Probes were PCR amplified from plasmid clones\n(GFP) or from genomic DNA (RpL32-2 and 18S rRNA). The intensity\nof the radioactive bands was calculated with a phosphorimager\n(Molecular Image-FX, Bio-Rad). For RNA half-life analysis, a 50 ml\ncell culture was grown until 1 OD600, treated with 150 mg\/ml\n1,10-phenanthroline (t0), and then 7 ml aliquots were transferred\ninto a tube with about 1 volume of crushed ice after 0, 2, 10, 20, 40\nand 60 min.

Novazyme (50 mg\/ml,\nInterspex Products Inc) and zymolyase 20T (100mg\/ml, Europa\nBioproducts Ltd) were used to make spheroplasts by incubating the\ncells for 30 min at 371C in 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 6.5). The\nGFP probes consisted of four amino-modified oligonucleotides, as\ndescribed earlier (Dower and Rosbash, 2002).

The secondary antibody was a rabbit HRP-\nconjugated anti-goat IgG, which was detected with chemilumi-\nnescent HRP substrate (Immobilon Western, Millipore). The\nchemiluminescent signal was analysed with Quantity One (Bio-\nrad). The monoclonal 8WG16 (Covance) was used to detect the\nRNA polymerase II. Luciferase expression was measured with the\nSteady-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) directly from an\naliquot of cell culture: 10 ml of culture (in EMM) were mixed with\n15 ml of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and 25ml of Steady-Glo\nsubstrate solution (Promega) in a 96-well microtiter plate;\nluminescence was measured with a plate reader (Tecan).\nSupplementary data\nSupplementary data are available at The EMBO Journal Online\n(http:\/\/www.embojournal.org).\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Stephen Dove for help and support.
