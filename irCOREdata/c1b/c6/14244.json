For many disciplines, tutorials, seminars and workshops have a special\nrole in developing expertise in applying complex and abstract theories to rich, diverse bodies\nof material. The ability to present convincing arguments, both written and verbal, is a skill\nthat undergraduates need to acquire. Discussion between tutors and students, be it in the\nform of feedback on assessed work, structured classes or ad hoc meetings, can help students\nto acquire a deep understanding of their subject, and the confidence to find their own paths\n39\nFrances Condron Using electronic resources to support dialogue in undergraduate small-group teaching\nthrough a discipline. In a climate of still-rising student numbers and reduced funding,\nteaching in small groups has increasingly come under pressure. While new technologies can\nbe used to supplement small-group teaching, their application is often costly and\nproblematic. Within the UK, the past fifteen years has seen much time and money devoted to\ncreating new tools, tutorials and datasets (most clearly through the Teaching and Learning\nTechnology Programme). However, evaluations have highlighted problems with these new\nresources, and many resources are not used beyond the departments in which they were\ncreated (HEFCE et al., 1999). Because of the limited success of many earlier educational\ntechnology projects, research efforts have now shifted to focus on the pedagogic and subject-\nspecific factors determining the effectiveness of new tools in improving student learning.\nThe ASTER project (Assisting Small-group Teaching through Electronic Resources,\nhttp:\/\/cti-psy.york.acuk\/asterf) is funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for\nEngland (HEFCE), and is one of the Teaching and Learning Technology Programme's\n(TLTP) phase 3 projects. ASTER is a collaboration between the Universities of Oxford,\nSurrey and York (lead site), and University College Northampton. Since autumn 1998,\nASTER has been exploring how new technologies support staff and students to make\nbetter use of small-group teaching, be it in tutorials, seminars, workshops, laboratories or\nother teaching situations. It is multidisciplinary, covering archaeology, classics, history,\nEnglish literature, mathematics in engineering and related disciplines, philosophy, physics,\npsychology and religion. We have reported on good practice and expertise in the use of\nICT, based on an extensive literature survey, email and telephone questionnaires, and more\nrecently, detailed case studies of current UK practice. The survey and case studies were\nundertaken to gather evidence of current good practice in supporting small-group teaching\nwith ICT. Reports on these surveys are available (ASTER, 1999; ASTER, 2000), outlining\nthe range of tools currently in use, and the contexts in which they are used to support\nsmall-group teaching. They range from course Web pages and online reading consulted\noutside the class, to computer-mediated communication supplementing face-to-face\nmeetings. This article focuses on the evidence for ICT supporting dialogue - extended\ndiscussions between and within a group with the purpose of exploring a particular topic,\nidentifying and understanding varied viewpoints, and possibly reaching consensus.\nWhile some digital resources act as a medium through which dialogue occurs, the majority\nof the ASTER case studies document indirect support, for example by providing material\nfor consultation prior to the class (such as online documents, collections on CD-ROM), or\nfor remediation to ensure that students can express themselves in specialist language (such\nas multimedia tutorials on essential mathematics). There is some overlap in the tools used\nacross disciplines, but there are also important variations. These variations obviously arise\nthrough the limited availability of resources for any given topic, but this is no explanation\nfor the selective use of tools by individual disciplines. What we also seem to be seeing is\ndifferences in academic discourse manifesting themselves in the choice of tools to support\nit. Before looking at the survey findings in more detail, we need to explore the relationship\nbetween academic discourse and teaching and learning.\nSmall-group teaching, disciplinary differences and dialogue\nThere are several interconnected factors determining what and how electronic tools and\nresources can be employed to support learning through dialogue. Discussion classes are\n40\nAlt-] Volume 9 Number 2\nvital to support students' acquisition of subject expertise and jargon, and to engage in\nacademic discourse, both verbal and written. However, opportunities for discussion\nbetween students and tutors are reliant on the balance of teaching methods (lectures,\npracticals, seminars and so on) used, and class size, both of which vary between disciplines\nand institutions. Electronic tools can support discussion, mediating between individuals,\nthough previous experience in using tools either for research or teaching by students and\ntutors influences their perception of the value of these tools.\nSeminars, tutorials, workshops and laboratories not only give feedback and opportunities\nto develop subject expertise, they are also a vital avenue for helping students to adjust to\ndepartmental culture, and the UK university system. Close contact with staff motivates\nstudents to engage with their discipline, and staff can support students to integrate into the\ndepartment and collaborate with peers. Thomas argues that male and female students (and\nby implication staff) have contrasting experiences of adjusting to departmental life, and in\nsituating themselves within a departmental culture (Thomas, 1990). Although efforts need\nto be made to accommodate multiple approaches to learning, research shows that students\nwhose approaches to learning match those of their discipline tend to engage most readily\nin their subject (Kolb, 1981). Ramsden and Entwistle suggest that the ways in which\nteaching is organized and delivered in departments influences students' orientation to\nlearning (Entwistle and Ramsden, 1983: 188). Becher (1989) goes further, arguing that the\nuse of particular learning and teaching methods within any single discipline is not only\nbecause they meet the needs of that discipline, but also because of the traditions and\nexpectations that have developed in the discipline. Becher's 'academic tribes' welcome new\nmembers, but they must adjust their behaviour to fit in.\nThe balance of teaching practices used varies between institutions and disciplines, and\nopportunities for close support may be limited. Smeby's survey of Norwegian universities\nfound seminars to be a prominent feature of humanities, arts and social sciences teaching,\nthough not for the hard and applied sciences (Smeby, 1996). Becher has similar findings,\narguing that these disciplinary differences in the balance of teaching methods are, like\nresearch, international (Becher, 1994). Smeby uses Kyvik's division of academic language\ninto codified and literary languages to explain differences in teaching practices across\ndisciplines in Norwegian universities. He argues that codified language is a feature of hard\nand applied sciences (such as mathematics, and also music), to which students are formally\nintroduced. Students need to have a good grasp of specialist language in order to\ncommunicate in their discipline. By contrast, in humanities and social sciences, academic\nlanguage is more literate, and although formal, the rules of style and expression are rarely\ndirectly transmitted to students. Although in very broad categories, Kyvik's division of\nacademic language can be utilized to explain differences in educational practices across\ndisciplines.\nIt is not therefore surprising that so many electronic tools and resources are used to support\nthe varied activities that take place in university small-group teaching. Resources are not\nonly selected for their subject content: presentation styles and the activities that tools and\nresources support should complement teaching practices. As argued above, these practices\nare deeply embedded in traditions of teaching and learning, and it should not be surprising\nthat they are reflected in the range of electronic tools and resources used by any discipline.\nMoreover, using ICT in teaching can introduce new ways of teaching\/learning\/assessment,\n41\nFrances Condron Using electronic resources to support dialogue in undergraduate small-group teaching\nand unless this is recognized and accommodated for, the ICT intervention is not likely to be\nsuccessful. Research into human-computer interaction can be fruitfully applied to the\nstudy of computer use in teaching and learning. Developed by Vygotsky, activity theory\nexplores the ways in which humans act and interact through tools and resources, and social\nand cultural factors influencing such activity. The key term is mediation - how tools are\nused to support action and to achieve objectives, and how these tools are perceived by their\nusers. As the user becomes more experienced with particular tools, perception shifts away\nfrom tools as objects restricting actions, the user becomes less conscious of the tool and\nfocuses on the end goal (Nardi, 1996, provides a useful introduction to activity theory and\nnew technology). Applying the same argument to higher education, academics within\ndisciplines with a long tradition of using computers for research view them as part of a\nsuite of working tools and a means towards an end (for example, astronomy - it is not\npossible to teach or research astronomy without computers). Students are therefore taught\ntopics through\/with computers as it is the accepted method for researching these areas. In\ndisciplines with a short or limited experience of working with computers, computers can be\nseen as a barrier or restricting factor for one's work, and viewed with suspicion.\nThe ASTER project attempts to pull together these areas of research in teaching practice\nand the use of new technologies. While the ASTER survey has not been able to gather\ninformation on teaching practices across entire institutions, or nationally for all\ndepartments in a given subject area, it has nevertheless revealed differences in teaching\npractices between disciplines. These differences are not clear cut; the number of ASTER\ncase studies is very small, and our findings cannot be taken as representative of UK higher\neducation. However, they raise issues that deserve further attention.\nThe ASTER survey\nIn 1999, ASTER undertook a series of surveys to get a picture of current and good\npractice in how new tools and electronic resources are being used to support small-group\nteaching. A questionnaire was sent out by email to thousands of academics in Britain and\nbeyond; 40 academics were interviewed by telephone; 30 case studies were carried out in\nlate 1999 and early 2000. Data for the case studies were gathered through structured\ninterviews with academic staff, informal feedback from students, and class observation\n(where possible). The case studies cover a range of subjects: archaeology, art, chemistry,\nclassics, engineering, English, mathematics, physics, psychology and theology. All report\non the use of ICT in face-to-face teaching, and are supported by an extensive literature\nsurvey. The case studies and reports from the surveys are available from the ASTER Web\nsite (ASTER 2000; http:\/\/cti-psy.york.ac.uk\/asterf). Table 1 summarizes the findings for\nscience and humanities disciplines, and psychology.\nMany tools and resources are used to support teaching in and beyond the classroom. They\nare selected not only for their subject coverage, but also because their presentation style\nconforms to or complements traditional teaching practices for the given subject. While the\nformer is easily recognized by academics, they may not be so aware of how the latter\ninfluences their choice of resources.\nThese tools are being used individually and in combination. Our survey revealed that the\nmajority are consulted outside the classroom, providing material for discussion in class.\n42\nAlt-J Volume 9 Number 2\nComputer-mediated communication\nThe Web\nVirtual learning environments\nSimulation software\nComputer-aided assessment\nCMC enables students to contact tutors at a distance.\nVirtual seminars are organized on email, chat or discussion\nlists, to extend face-to-face discussions beyond the classroom,\nor to add an element of dialogue to a module that would\notherwise be unavailable.\nCourse Web pages make information and resources available\nto students.\nThe Web provides access to primary and secondary sources.\nHelps students and staff keep up to date with developments\nin their subject\nStudents can author Web pages, practising new writing and\npresentation skills.\nThe Web is widely used in the humanities, less so in the\nsciences.\nThe term covers a wide range of tools, from generic to highly\nspecialized.\nVLEs facilitate provision of course information and\ndissemination of resources to students.\nThey support group\/collaborative learning.\nSome specialist VLEs' provide an environment for learning\nprogramming languages.\nSimulations introduce students to methods, concepts and\ntechniques.\nMultiple choice quizzes are used for formative assessment\nCAA is a common feature in multimedia tutorials.\nCAA is seldom used in the humanities, but appears to be\nmore popular in psychology, and widely used in the sciences.\nTable I: Summary ofASTER's findings on the use ofC&IT to support small-group teaching\nThe Web is widely viewed as a source for reading material prior to classes in the arts and\nhumanities, though rarely used in the sciences, and not extensively used in psychology. The\nWeb as a digital library duplicates the traditional practice of directing students to reading\nprior to the class, the only difference being the mode of access.\nOur survey found that some psychologists were using virtual learning environments to post\nessential reading and set tasks prior to face-to-face classes. When employed in this way,\nVLEs facilitate discussion by providing content and information, but only in the same way\nas preparatory reading, irrelevant of the medium.\nMultimedia tutorials are used to ensure that students have sufficient skills to continue with\nthe course - thus they are popular in physics and engineering, particularly for mathematics;\nlanguage drillers support students in acquiring basic vocabulary and grammar. Students\nare directed to multimedia tutorials for independent study, freeing up face-to-face meetings\nfor more advanced discussion. They equip students with specialist languages in order to\nparticipate in face-to-face classes - mathematics for science undergraduates, and grammar\nfor basic language learners. However, the ASTER survey found very little use of\nmultimedia tutorials in the arts and humanities.\n43\nFrances Condron Using electronic resources to support dialogue in undergraduate small-group teaching\nComputer-mediated communication, and the communications features of virtual learning\nenvironments, directly support dialogue. Although an essential tool for distance learning,\nCMC supports traditional education and research. Case studies documenting successful\nand problematic experiences with CMC abound (for example, McNaught et al., 1999;\nDuffy et al, 1996). The ASTER survey found that CMC was used fairly extensively in the\narts and humanities and psychology (to host discussions and support group work), but less\nso for undergraduate teaching in the sciences.\nComputer-aided assessment is used in the sciences, and in psychology, for formative\nassessment (and feedback where it is built in), and sometimes also for summative\nassessment. However, it is not popular in the arts and humanities, where assessment tends\nto demand extended prose.\nAlthough the ASTER sample is small, these preliminary findings suggest that:\n\u2022 The sciences and some parts of the arts and humanities use ICT tools explicitly to\nintroduce students to codified language - mathematics, grammar - essential for\nparticipating in academic discourse, and computer-aided assessment to review\nstudents' knowledge and capabilities.\n\u2022 While computer-mediated communication tools support discussion, they do not readily\nsupport exchange in codified language as the majority of CMC tools have been\ndeveloped for the Latin alphabet.\n\u2022 Discussion in text-based disciplines also uses specialist dialogue, though the rules are\nimplicit rather than explicit. Students are exposed to academic discourse through\nreading (either online or in print), and discussions take place through computers as well\nas face-to-face.\n\u2022 Psychology falls between the two extremes - Kyvik's division of academic discourse\ninto two types assumes that academics need specialize in only one, though psychology\nspans both. Arguably discourse in most subjects includes a mix of codified and literary\nlanguage, and several tools may be required to support discourse.\nWe can further explore these findings by looking at the educational objectives expressed by\nacademics for using electronic resources (Table 2). Not surprisingly, disciplinary differences\nemerge.\nArts and humanities Psychology Sciences\nDevelop ICT skills\nImprove verbal, written\ncommunication\nIntroduce and develop research\nmethods\nAccess to written and pictorial\nsources\nDevelop critical reading\nDevelop ICT skills\nImprove verbal, written\ncommunication\nIntroduce and develop research\nmethods\nAccess to material \u2014 case studies\nWork in teams\nDevelop ICT skills\nImprove verbal, written\ncommunication\nIntroduce and develop research\nmethods\nRemediation (mathematics)\nEssential skills and techniques\nGrasp concepts\nHelp with visualization\nAnalysis\nTable 2: Educational objectives served by electronic resources\n44\nAk-J Volume 9 Number 2\nThese differences are partly obscured by academics using the same terms to describe\nparticular needs. For example, the range of ICT skills that students must acquire for a\nphysics course is very different from those required for an English degree. However, there is\nsome overlap in that all students need to be information literate. The drive, via the QAA\nand employers, for universities to instill key skills in students means that they should be\nable to communicate electronically as well as verbally and in writing. The above discussion\nfocused on differences in academic discourse and how they are reflected in the range of\ntools used to support students in acquiring expertise and engaging with their subject. This\nsuggests that generic tools such as email or text-based discussion lists, supporting literary\nlanguage, do not serve learning and discussion in all disciplines equally.\nUndergraduate degrees should equip students with the skills and knowledge to continue\ninto research, should they choose to do so, and these are of course particular to the\ndiscipline. There is some variation in the sources of reading to support this research. While\nacademic articles online are common to all subjects (often at a cost), arts and humanities\nundergraduate teaching benefits greatly from the many primary sources now available\nthrough the Web, and image-rich multimedia pages on topics that provide an overview of a\nsubject which may otherwise be taught through texts. Access to materials for psychologists\nmay be via CD-ROM, as case studies, used in a problem-based learning context where\nstudents are introduced to psychological methods and theories. In the sciences, the Web is\nnot viewed as an important source of material for undergraduate teaching. However,\nsimulations are valuable in helping students to understand concepts.\nConclusion\nThis brief review shows how the needs of disciplines are supported by particular electronic\nresources, both for the subject matter they contain, and for the teaching and learning\nactivities that they support. The differences the ASTER survey has identified in the use of\neducational technology between disciplines is a manifestation of different traditions of\nteaching and learning, of varied uptake of computers, and the perceived value of ICT for\nresearch and teaching. There is a genuine argument for educational technology to be\nsensitive to discipline needs in its pedagogic design as well as content. Generic tools such as\nvirtual learning environments and computer-mediated communication support particular\nstyles of dialogue and interaction which are not common or of equal value to all\ndisciplines. Subject-specific tools and resources - online resources, simulations and\nmultimedia tutorials - address particular teaching and learning needs. There is no\ndefinitive good practice in supporting dialogue through electronic resources. Rather, good\npractice comes about through matching teaching and learning activities to the individual\ntools or resources that support them. Where new activities are introduced by the tools,\nadditional support may well be required to overcome the many barriers to change.\nAcknowledgements\nThis article builds on work carried out by the ASTER team: Dick Bacon, Catherine\nBennett, Chris Colbourn, Angela Fisher, Michael Fraser, Nick Hammond, Sylvia\nHogarth, Anne Jelfs, Stuart Lee, Simone Richardson, Lee Sproats, Lena Tostevin, Annie\nTrapp, David Wonnacott and the author.\n45\nFrances Condron Using electronic resources to support dialogue in undergraduate small-group teaching\nReferences\nASTER (1999), 'A survey of current practice in the use of C&IT to support small-group\nteaching activities in disciplines associated with the humanities, physics, and psychology',\nYork: ASTER, http:\/\/cti-psy.york.ac.uk\/aster\/publications\/Report_2\/report_2. html.\nASTER (2000), 'Investigating the use of electronic resources in small-group learning and\nteaching', York: ASTER [http:\/\/cti-psy.york.ac.uk\/aster\/resources\/publications\/csreport\/\ncsreport.html].\nBecher, T.
