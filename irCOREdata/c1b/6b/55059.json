They can be voracious\ngrazers so that high abundance and biomass often results in\nthem playing a major role in structuring benthic\ncommunities (Tuya et al. 2004 and references therein).\nThey are particularly abundant and ecologically pivotal in\nkelp forests but also on the nearshore shelf around\nAntarctica, where they are often the most obvious\nmegafauna. The first specimens were collected during the\nvoyage of HMS Challenger in 1873\u201376 and most of the\nAntarctic and sub-Antarctic species were described in\nthe first decades of the twentieth century (David et al.\n2005a). In the Southern Ocean, the regular urchin\nSterechinus neumayeri frequently dominates the shallows\nand a wide variety of species including pencil and\nburrowing urchins frequent the shelf, slope, abyssal plains\nand trenches (e.g. Brockington et al. 2001, Mooi et al.\n2004, David et al. 2005a, 2005b, Brandt et al. 2007a,\nPalma et al. 2007).\nThe dominance of S. neumayeri in the zone accessible to\nsampling has made it one of the principal model species\nfor studies of Antarctic benthos (e.g. Pearse & Giese 1966,\nBosch et al. 1987, Brey & Gutt 1991, Brey et al. 1995,\nTyler et al. 2000, Brockington & Peck 2001, Cox &\nHalanych 2005, Linse et al. 2006a, Brockington et al.\n2007). However, with the exception of a few other species,\n227\nThis publication is dedicated to the memory of Dr Helen R. Wilcock\nfor whom to visit Antarctica was a lifelong dream.\nAntarctic Science 20 (3), 227\u2013244 (2008) & Antarctic Science Ltd 2008 Printed in the UK doi: 10.1017\/S0954102008001181\ne.g. Abatus cordatus (Schatt & Fe\u00b4ral 1991, 1996, Poulin &\nFe\u00b4ral 1995) or A. ingens (Thomson & Riddle 2005), other\nstudies of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic echinoids have\nsimply documented their importance in the composition of\nmacrobenthic assemblages (e.g. Arnaud et al. 1998, Ramos\n1999, Barnes & Brockington 2003, Rehm et al. 2006,\nGriffiths et al. 2008) or their diversity of reproductive\nmodes (e.g. Poulin et al. 2002, Chenuil et al. 2004,\nPearse & Lockhart 2004 and references therein). Even then\nsuch studies have already shown this taxon to provide\npowerful insight into differences between evolutionary and\necological success and glacial versus interglacial selective\npressures (Poulin et al. 2002).\nThe extreme physical disturbance around Antarctica (poor\nfossilization conditions) and rarity of rock uncovered by ice\n(few areas of exposed fossils) combine to produce a very\npoor record of faunal change through time in the Southern\nOcean. With strong calcified tests and spines, the Echinoidea\nhave one of the better fossil records of the region, from the\nCretaceous to the Holocene (e.g. Hotchkiss 1982, Blake &\nAronson 1998, Ne\u00b4raudeau et al. 2000, BAS Fossil database -\nGriffiths, personal communication 2007). Their large size,\nease of sampling with benthic trawls and ease of\nidentification makes them an ideal group to investigate\ncurrent and past biodiversity patterns around Antarctica and\nwhat underlies them. Some recent studies have assembled\nspecies lists for a few markedly different localities, such as\nthe eastern Weddell Sea, Deception Island, the Ross Sea and\nalong the coast adjacent to Victoria Land (see Jacob 2001,\nLovell & Trego 2003, Chiantore et al. 2006, De Domenico\net al. 2006). The database of Southern Ocean echinoids\nassembled by David et al. (2005a), one of the best for any\nAntarctic taxa, still reveals major gaps in the geographic and\nbathymetric distributions of many species.\nProbably the single most interesting region within the\nSouthern Ocean for marine biogeographic and evolutionary\nlinks between the Antarctic and a neighbouring continent\nis the Scotia Arc. It encompasses islands (and thus shelf\nareas) of widely different ages and isolation levels and is\nthe only semi-continuous shelf and slope link to a\ntemperate region. It has become an important focus for\nmany research programmes on benthos including the\nSpanish Anta\u00b4rtida 8611 (Ramos 1999), German LAMPOS\n(Arntz & Brey 2003), international IBMANT (Arntz &\nRios 1999, Arntz et al. 2005a, 2005b) and British\nBIOPEARL (Linse 2008) scientific cruises. In the current\nstudy we investigate the echinoids living on seven island\nslopes. We sampled from the continental shelf to the upper\ncontinental slope around all the major archipelagos of the\nScotia Arc and report the most comprehensive geographic\nand bathymetric surveys to date for a region of the\nSouthern Ocean. Furthermore, we examine the contribution\nthat echinoids make to Antarctic benthic richness through\ntheir considerable associated commensal fauna.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy area\nSpecimens of regular and irregular Echinoidea were collected\nduring the scientific cruise JR 144 (BIOPEARL) of RRS\nJames Clark Ross around the Scotia Arc in 2006.

In the South\nShetland Islands (SH) we sampled at Deception Island (DI)\nand Livingston Island (LI) and to the north-east of these at\nElephant Island (EI) and Powell Basin (PB). East from there\nwe sampled the southernmost of the South Sandwich Islands\n(SSI) - Southern Thule Island and finally adjacent to South\nGeorgia (SG) and Shag Rocks (SR) at the northernmost limit\nof the polar frontal zone. For brevity throughout this study\nwe refer to other localities in the region using the\nabbreviations: Adelie Land (AD), Antarctic Peninsula (AP),\nBellingshausen Sea (BS), Bouvet Island (BI), Cape Horn\/\nMagellan Region (CH\/MR), Davis Sea (DS), Dronning\nMaud Land (DM), Falkland Islands (FI), Kerguelen Islands\n(KI), Lazarev Sea (LS), eastern Weddell Sea (E-WS),\nwestern Weddell Sea (W-WS), Ross Sea (RS), and South\nOrkney Islands (SO). Within the Scotia Arc are islands with\nwidely varying degrees of isolation and age, and some of the\nvolcanos have even had considerable eruptions within the\nlast few decades (Smellie et al. 1998).\nSampling\nBenthic samples were taken by two different types of bottom\ntrawls; Agassiz trawl (AGT) and rough bottom otter trawl\n(RBOT) at 24 stations between depths of 91\u20131045 m\n(Table I). When the samples reached the deck, echinoids\nwere separated by hand from other taxa and into families.\nOf each species collected three specimens were fixed in\n96% ethanol, and further specimens of each species were\nfrozen at -208C. Identities were later established to species\nlevel following literature keys.\nMorphometric and biomass analysis\nMeasurements of test length, width and height were made on\neach individual or each species using digital Vernier callipers\nto accuracy levels of 1 mm. In total 273 regular (cidaroid and\ntemnopleurid) and irregular (spatangoid and holasteroid)\nspecimens from 24 locations were measured (Table II).\nPopulation size spectra and shape variability (ratios of length,\nwidth and height measurements) were compared within and\nbetween species and locations. In cidaroid specimens all\nspines were removed before mass measurements for\ncomparability between specimens as some had either\nincomplete numbers of spines or epibionts on the spines. Dry\nmass and ash free dry mass measurements were obtained\nexclusively from frozen samples. Only the tests of species\nrepresented by at least 10 individuals were ashed to obtain ash\nfree dry mass measurements as intact representatives of each\nspecies were considered as rare and valuable reference material.\nOur definitions were as follows,\nWet mass (WM): individuals were unfrozen and pressed\nonto tissue paper to remove excess moisture for 30\nseconds. Their wet mass was then determined to\naccuracies of 0.001 g.\nDry mass (DM): individuals were oven dried at 608C for\n24 hours in pre-weighed tin foil receptacles. Specimens\nwere allowed to cool to ambient temperature. Thereafter\nspecimens were again measured to accuracies of 0.001 g.\nAsh-free dry mass (AFDM): dried individuals were placed\nin a furnace at 4808C for 24 hours in pre-weighed tin\nreceptacles. Specimens were allowed to cool to ambient\ntemperature in a desiccator containing silica gel.\nThereafter specimens were transferred to a microbalance\n(Satorius MC210P) and the ash measured to accuracies\nof 0.001 g. The ash mass was then subtracted from the\npreviously recorded DM for each specimen to yield the\nAFDM to accuracies of 0.001 g.\nDespite masses being recorded to 0.001 g accuracy, we only\nreport these to 0.1 g levels due to inherent inaccuracies, such\nas variation in gut contents across individuals.\nEpibiont analysis\nSpecimens of every species from every site were examined for\nepifaunal colonists. Up to 24 individuals of each species were\nstudied for attached macrofauna using a binocular microscope.\nIn most cases at least some spines had been lost during the\nprocess of being trawled, brought to the surface and landed\non the ship\u2019s deck. Where a species was represented by many\nindividuals at a site, the most intact specimens were\nexamined. On the echinoids with epifauna (cidaroid species),\nthe colonists were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic\nlevel, in most cases species. Each epifaunal species was\nscored as abundant (present on all specimens examined),\noccasional (present on, all but. 1 individual) or rare\n(present on just 1 individual).\nResults\nEchinoidea were present, sometimes abundant but rarely a\ndominant component of most shelf trawls at locations around\nthe Scotia Arc. Echinoids were rarely present in any of the\ncontinental slope trawls (~1000 or 1500 m depths) but at the\nSouthern Thule site (deep sea) echinoids were only found at\n1000 m. Otherwise echinoids were absent from some study\ndepths at some locations but only at South Georgia did they\ndominate the benthos (Table II). In total 13 species of regular\nurchins (Fig. 1a) and 10 species of irregular urchins (Fig. 1b)\nwere found. These collections greatly extended the\ndistribution and depth ranges, by thousands of km and\nhundreds of metres respectively, for several species.\nDistribution and biometrics of Scotia Arc echinoid species\nWhere our data extend the depth, test size and\/or geographic\ndistribution ranges of echinoid species or the epibiont taxa\nECHINOIDS OF THE SCOTIA ARC 229\nknown from them we show this information in bold.

Confirmed distributions of this\nspecies are only known from two sites in the\nDavis Sea (David et al. 2005a). A record\nfrom the Weddell Sea appeared doubtful to\nDavid et al. (2005a). They stated \u201cIt is\npossible that one specimen, collected in the\nWS by the RV Polarstern and identified as P.\naff hispida by De Ridder et al. (1992), may\nbe P. aurorae.\u201d Because their specimen was\ndifferent from typical P. aurorae they did not\nwish to suggest the dramatic change in its\ngeographic distribution. The three specimens\ncollected during the current cruise were\nclearly identified as P. aurorae by their test\nmorphology and distinct colour (Fig. 4c & d)\nand extend the species biogeographic range\nthousands of kilometres beyond its previous\nconfirmed find. Size measurements for the\nspecimens of P. aurorae are given in Table III.\nCidaroid epifauna\nNo epifauna were found on any of the species of irregular\nechinoids, or regular echinoids of the family Echinidae, at\nany of the sites or depths they were found. Most cidaroid\nechinoids had epifauna, mainly on their large primary\nspines, but also elsewhere. These cidaroid echinoids had\nconsiderable biodiversity associated with them, including\neight phyla of animals as well Foraminifera and\nfoliculinid protists (Table IV). Of the 51 faunal species\n(representing 10 classes) found on cidaroids all but seven\nwere identified to genus level and most to species. By\nfar the most rich epifaunal taxon was the Phylum\nBryozoa, Class Gymnolaemata and the least the ascidians\njust represented by one species on one echinoid\nindividual. Bryozoans and foraminiferans were the only\ntaxa present as epifauna on every cidaroid species and\nrecorded from every site.\nKATRIN LINSE et al.238\nThe most colonized individual was an Austrocidaris cf\nspinulosa from the Falkland Trough, which had 16\nmacrofaunal species attached. This species had the richest\nepifauna both in terms of average (6.5\u0004 1.4 species) per\nindividual and in total (Table IV). Meaningful comparisons\nof richness between cidaroid species, sites and depths were\ndifficult because of such unequal sample sizes. ANOVA\nrevealed no significant differences between echinoid\nspecies or sites (F4,3 , 2.4, P. 0.056). There were,\nhowever, significant differences between the sample depths\n(F2 \u00bc 27.8, P. 0.001). The shallowest sample depths\n(160\u2013200 m) were the richest with 4.89 (\u0004 0.48, n \u00bc 38)\nepifaunal species per individual compared to 0.79 (\u0004 0.19,\nn \u00bc 25) at 500 m and 0.43 (\u0004 0.3, n \u00bc 7) at 1000 m. Thus\nthere was an order of magnitude decrease in epifaunal\nrichness from the shallow continental shelf to the\ncontinental slope.\nDiscussion\nWhat we know about the sea floor of the Southern Ocean\nsuggests that the macrofauna there is rich, can be abundant\nand much of it lives nowhere else (Arntz et al. 1994, 1997,\nBrandt et al. 2007a). In the shallows, the depth for which\nwe know by far the most, echinoids are typically very\nabundant and ecologically important, not dissimilar to\nelsewhere in the world (Andrew et al. 2002, Jacob et al.\n2003). Unlike elsewhere at most shallow localities around\nAntarctica this abundance is represented by the same single\nspecies. However, 74 echinoid species are known from the\nSouthern Ocean (David et al. 2005a) of which we found\nnearly a third in 38 trawl samples or 50 500 m2 within a\nsmall region, the Scotia Arc. The single species so\ndominant in abundance in the shallows and in the scientific\nliterature, Sterechinus neumayeri, was found in just a single\nshelf sample. Few if any epibiotic species have ever been\nreported associated with S. neumayeri, so in the shallows\nechinoids are neither species rich nor harbourers of\nrichness. The current study shows that the shelves around\nthe Scotia Arc are both rich in species numbers of\nechinoids and their associated fauna but also that unlike the\nshallows they rarely dominate there.\nWhat does echinoid distribution tell us about Southern\nOcean benthos?\nEchinoids are typically large, obvious and fairly easily\nidentifiable animals for which a comprehensive database\nand identification guide to Southern Ocean species has\nbeen established (David et al. 2005a). There can be few\ntaxa that will better reveal how well we know the Southern\nOcean fauna. At a family level our findings were as might\nbe expected. Most Antarctic echinoid species known\nare representatives of two dominant families, the\nSchizasteridae (22 species known) and Cidaroidae (15\nspecies known) (David et al. 2005a). So it was in our\nScotia Arc shelf samples, these two families being\nrepresented by nine species each. The Echinidae, typically\nthe most abundant but not species-rich, Antarctic family\ndominated the total numbers of specimens but were\nrepresented by just three species.\nThe current study of continental shelf and slope depths\nfound 23 species at seven geographical localities. None of\nthe 23 species we found were new to science - all were\nclearly identifiable as known species. At the next scale\ndown, the number of echinoid species found represent a\nsubstantial proportion of the total. As 14 species have\npreviously only been reported much deeper than we\nsampled (Brandt et al. 2007a), the 23 samples we report\nhere comprise more than 38% of the known shelf and slope\nechinoids we could have expected to find. Either the Scotia\nArc is disproportionately rich or disproportionably well\nsampled or both. Evidence of other scientific cruise paths\nand studies of other taxa suggests the Scotia Arc is both\namongst the best studied of Antarctic regions and also very\nrich in species (e.g. Tatia`n et al. 2005, Ramos-Espla` et al.\n2005, Hilbig et al. 2006, Linse et al. 2006b, Clarke et al.\n2007, Primo & Vazquez 2007, Barnes & Griffiths 2008).\nAt a finer scale, for many of the echinoid species we found,\nthe localities, depths or sizes were new. For eight (~35%) of\nthese, this was the first record of the species in the areas we\nfound them in - the next nearest localities where they had\npreviously been found were hundreds to thousands of\nkilometres away. Three species were found in shallower\nwater than previously reported and four at larger sizes than\npreviously known. Thus status of the echinoid species we\nfound was changed by this study despite our sample\nprotocol taking only single samples at each depth, focussing\non the most sampled depth range, in one of the more\nsampled regions and the taxon being one of the most\nobvious and well known. In contrast to the Scotia\nArc, sampling less well-known regions, such as the\nAmundsen Sea, should almost certainly increase known\ngeographic and bathymetric ranges as well as unearthing\nnew species.\nOnly two (28.6%) of the nine families but 27 (54%) of the\n50 species known to occur within the Scotia Arc were not\nfound by our sampling regime. Considering the small size\nof our sample areas and lack of replicates at each depth this\nvery high \u2018find rate\u2019 suggests echinoid species are both\nfairly common and ubiquitous within the areas in which\nthey occur. This certainly contrasts with patterns shown by\nsome other taxa (e.g. isopod crustaceans, which appear to\nbe highly patchy: equivalent sampling would only capture\na tiny proportion of species at a given locality (Kaiser et al.\n2007)). These two taxa seem to represent examples of\nopposite extremes of distribution, but we suggest that it is\nthe echinoids which are unusual. Scientific sampling\nexpeditions around the Scotia Arc have generally found\nboth low proportions of e.g. ascidians, bryozoans,\npolychaetes, molluscs or other taxa known to occur in an\nECHINOIDS OF THE SCOTIA ARC 239\narea and often new species of each (Ramos 1999, Arntz &\nBrey 2003, Lo\u00b4pez-Fe 2005, Linse 2008).\nSouthern Ocean biogeography\nDespite being one of the less speciose classes in Antarctica\n(Clarke & Johnston 2003), investigations of echinoid\ndistribution can be particularly useful at elucidating\nSouthern Ocean biogeography. Ease of identification\nmakes literature data more reliable, most of their\nreproductive patterns are known, their fossil record is\nrelatively (for the Southern Ocean) good and it is unlikely\nmany new species will be found. Because the reproductive\nstrategies of most Antarctic echinoids are known (Poulin\net al. 2002, Pearse & Lockhart 2004, David et al. 2005a),\ndistributions can be linked to apparent dispersal ability and\nthus how marine habitats in Antarctic have been colonized.\nThe opportunity for a locality to be colonized and its\nsubsequent diversity is dependent on geographic isolation\nand geological age of the locality. A strong fossil record,\nsuch as in the echinoids (Hotchkiss 1982, Ne\u00b4raudaeu et al.\n2000), is particularly important around Antarctica where\nthere have been massive oceanographic and climatic\nchanges (e.g. Barrett 2001, Matsumoto et al. 2001,\nMackensen 2004, Livermore et al. 2004, 2007, Maldonado\net al. 2006) but there are poor preservation conditions. The\ncurrent knowledge in Antarctic echinoid biogeography is\nsummarized in David et al. (2005a, 2005b) and is publicly\navailable in the SCAR MarBIN database (www.scar-\nmarbin.be). Of the nine echinoid species for which the\ncurrent study extends the known ranges, four are\nnoteworthy (Fig. 5). With the exception of Abatus\ncurvidens, all seem to be widely distributed around the\nSouthern Ocean, supporting an old notion of Antarctic\nspecies being circumpolar (Hedgpeth 1969, Clarke &\nJohnston 2003). Echinoids are probably now one of the\nbest examples of this concept, which has not proved so\ntrue in other taxa examined in detail (see Pen\u02dca Cantero\n2004, Allcock 2005, Collins & Rodhouse 2006, Linse\net al. 2006b, Barnes & Griffiths 2008).\nOf the species where we extended the ranges, only\nTripylaster philippi occurs north and south of the Polar\nFront. Geographic distribution ranges crossing the Polar\nFront are known for a further 23 echinoids species,\nespecially for deep sea species of the families\nPourtalesidae and Urechinidae. Of shelf species, six species\nof Schizasteridae, five species of Cidaridae, three species\nof Echinidae and the arbaciid Arbacia dufresnii (Blainville,\n1825) show cross-Polar Front distributions. Previously all\nrecords of T. philippi were Magellan or sub-Antarctic but\nour findings make it clear that it is a high-Antarctic species\nas well. The echinoids represent one of the best taxa to\nestablish fairly reliable current range estimates and thus\nmonitor Antarctic marine biological responses to climate\nchange. Elsewhere in the world range extensions and\ndistributional changes have been one of the most obvious\nsignals of regional warming (Walther et al. 2002). The\nScotia Arc is both a centre for warming (Quale et al. 2002,\nConvey 2006) and the only shelf\/slope link of the Southern\nOcean to areas north of the Polar Front; this makes it the\nobvious place to look for organismal changes and invasions.\nWith one exception all new records we found were on the\nshelves of the South Shetland and South Orkney\narchipelagos. This is surprising as these islands are\namongst the best-sampled areas in the Southern Ocean\n(e.g. Ramos 1999, Arntz & Brey 2003, Arntz et al. 2005b).\nIn the Southern Ocean only in the Ross Sea has a similar\nintensity of sampling been reported at species level\n(Chiantore et al. 2006, De Domenico et al. 2006). The\nonly echinoid we found on the slopes of the geologically\nyoung, isolated island of Southern Thule, South Sandwich\nIslands, was the deep-water species P. aurorae. A priori\nour expectation was that any echinoids at such a location\nwould be those either with planktotrophic larvae (i.e. wide\nand fast dispersers) or deeper species colonizing up the\nslope from the surrounding abyssal plains. Our finding of\nP. aurorae, only the third confirmed record for this species,\nis interesting as its previously confirmed closest location\nwas thousands of kilometres away in the Davis Sea.\nBathymetry and Antarctic benthos\nThe current study reports 19 trawls sampled at both shelf and\nslope depths. However the area sampled was 19.631 m2 from\n160\u2013500 m compared with 30.870 m2 at 1000\u20131500 m.\nWhilst the shelf samples yielded 19 species the slope\nsamples, despite the greater area, contained just four. The\ngreater supply of organic matter to the shelf makes such a\nresult unsurprising, especially considering echinoids are\noften primary consumers, but also grazing generalists and\ndeposit feeders (De Ridder & Lawrence 1982). However,\njust because each species is more abundant, and therefore\nmore likely to be sampled on the shelf does not necessarily\nmean the shelves are richer in echinoids. It seems likely\nthat with increasing depth proportionally greater areas need\nto be sampled to reach asymptote. This is supported by the\nfact that we found a smaller proportion of the echinoid\nspecies known to live below 1000 m depth than the\nproportion of those known to live on the shelf despite\nsampling 64% more of the deeper area. Antarctic benthos\nis known to be more eurybathic than fauna at most other\nlocations (Brey et al. 1996). This varies between groups\n(Hilbig et al. 2006, Kaiser & Brandt 2007). The echinoid\nspecies reported here are quite eurybathic, their mean depth\nrange being 1241 m (\u0004 245 m) and only one of these has\na known depth range of, 500 m. All but Aporocidaris\neltaniana occur on the continental shelf yet nearly all these\nechinoid species occur deeper than 750 m. That the current\nstudy only found three incidences of species occurring\noutside previously known depth ranges suggests that the\nKATRIN LINSE et al.240\npattern of echinoid bathymetric occurrence is probably fairly\nrobust.\nSize and biomass\nAs with bathymetry, the state of knowledge on maximum\nsizes in Antarctic echinoids seems to be fairly good. Our\nmeasurements of echinoid specimens generally lay within\nthe size ranges reported by Jacob (2001) and David et al.\n(2005a). Antarctic echinoids may grow very slowly\n(Brockington 2001), especially at larger size\/age, so\nincreases in 8\u20139 mm of test diameter that we report for\nCtenocidaris spinosa, A. rostratus and B. chesheri may\nhave significant implications for their lifespan. It is likely\nthat even this small increase in diameter of nearly 1 cm\nmight mean these species live decades more than\npreviously thought. However, we appreciate that site and\nfood availability differences could account for significant\ndifferences in growth characteristics (David & Laurin 1991,\nMespoulhe\u00b4 & David 1992).\nEchinoids can often be the major component of shelf\nbiomass and representatives of the Echinidae can fill ROV\nfilm of benthos or trawls from Antarctic shelves (e.g. Barry\net al. 2003, Cranmer et al. 2003). However, of the 38\ntrawls in the current study, only one was dominated by\nechinoids suggesting that our view of them as a dominant\ngroup based on super-abundance in the shallows is rarely\nthe case at depth. Most regular echinoids showed\nstraightforward increases in mass with increasing test\nlength, though strangely C. spinosa showed negligible\nincrease in mass with length (Fig. 2). Echinoid\ncontribution to biomass can be reported as simple wet\nmass, but we found this to be highly variable between\nspecies. Relationships between dry mass and ash free dry\nmass were more robust but whilst cidaroid species were\ntypically ~17% tissue mass, irregular species varied from\n17.7% (A. curvidens) to 11.2% and 8.9% (A. ingens and\nT. phillipi respectively). It is clear both that meaningful\nestimates of echinoid contributions to biomass need to\ninvolve identifications to species level and that irregular\nspecies show considerable intraspecific variability.\nEchinoid associated biodiversity\nIn tropical and temperate seas, echinoids are often associated\nwith changing levels of biodiversity through their grazing\nactivities. Keystone roles in mediating biodiversity (see\nElner & Vadas 1990) are unlikely in the Antarctic as most\nspecies occur below the depth of macroalgae and ice scour\nis pivotal in the shallows (see David et al. 2005a, Barnes\n& Conlan 2007). However, whilst most echinoids, such as\nEchinidae or Schizasteridae, are rarely fouled by epibionts,\nthe Cidaroid families carry a variety of taxa (Jacob 2001,\nDavid et al. 2003, He\u00b4te\u00b4rier et al. 2004, Massin & He\u00b4te\u00b4rier\n2004). A variety of animal externa from pycnogonan legs\nto brachiopod shells can be important, particularly with\nincreasing depth because of the rarity of hard surfaces\n(Barnes & Clarke 1995). The biodiversity associated with\nour study cidaroid species is greater (at all taxonomic\nlevels) known to the authors, than has ever been previously\ndescribed on any other Antarctic organism externa. Such\ncidaroid associated biodiversity declined considerably with\ndepth but is probably quite important at all depths. Firstly,\nthe 70 cidaroids examined represent only a relatively small\namount of surface area, yet had 10 classes and 51 benthic\nspecies associated with it (Table IV). Representatives of up\nto eight phyla had been previously reported from a study of\ntwo species of Antarctic cidaroids, but were not identified\nbeyond phylum level (He\u00b4te\u00b4rier et al. 2004). Some of the\nassociated species in the current study are otherwise very\nrare. For example Escharoides torquata found on\nN. mortenseni at Elephant Island had only previously been\nfound at a single site at South Georgia (Hayward 1995).\nSecondly, there was little overlap in epibiota between\ndifferent cidaroid specimens suggesting other specimens\nwould contribute further to local biodiversity. Third, many\nof the species, which occurred as cidaroid epibiota, were\nnot otherwise found in those trawls or even areas\n(BIOPEARL unpublished data). Many such species only or\nmostly occur as epibiota (Barnes & Clarke 1995). For\ntrawls of the BIOPEARL cruise in which cidaroids were\npresent, echinoid associated fauna was (on average) . 38%\nof the total number of species recorded, clearly a\nsignificant contribution to total biodiversity of a local area.\nIn addition in a number of trawls the epibionts of cidaroids\nwere a major proportion of all the sessile (and even total)\nspecies found. Finally most of the epibiota were sessile\nwithout planktotrophic larvae and thus with limited powers\nof dispersal. Being attached to mobile echinoids increases\npossibilities for dispersal and so colonization of this\ncomponent of biodiversity.\nIn summary, this study provides results on the geographic\ndistributions of echinoid species, including ranges extensions\nin nine species, on their test size and biomass relationships\nand on their associated epibiont biodiversity. Our data\nenhances the knowledge on biogeography and biodiversity\npatterns in the Antarctic benthos and shows the need for\nmore, internationally co-operative research to establish a\ncomprehensive picture of the biodiversity of shelf, slope\nand deep sea habitats of the Southern Ocean.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to the captain, officers and crew of\nRRS James Clarke Ross who enabled us to collect the\nsamples for this study as well as to our joint colleagues on\nthe cruise who helped sorting samples on deck.
