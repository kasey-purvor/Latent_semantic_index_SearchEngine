The purpose is to understand the evolutionary\nforces that contribute to the emergence and survival of dominant designs. Based on archival data\nand contemporaneous accounts of the period from 1967-82, we develop a series of propositions\nspecifying the evolutionary forces acting on technological trajectories within each level of\nanalysis. The resulting framework leads to a set of predictions about relationships between\ntechnological transparency, coevolution, and the emergence of dominant designs. Specifically,\nwe argue that when the costs and difficulty associated with transferring component knowledge\nbetween firms is low (technological transparency is high), technologies tend to coevolve across\nfirms, leading to the development of complementary technologies and increasing the likelihood\nof industry dominance. Where transparency is low, however, technologies tend to coevolve\nacross functions within firms, leading to the development of competing technologies across firms\nand increasing the likelihood of a technology\u2019s dominance within the firm. The data and\nargument suggests that the forces acting on these two types of technological trajectories are self-\nreinforcing, so that as momentum builds behind a trajectory, it becomes more likely that its\nevolutionary path will end in either firm- or system-level dominance.\n(Technology, Trajectories, Evolution, Competition)\n1TRAJECTORIES IN THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNOLOGY:\nA MULTI-LEVEL STUDY OF COMPETITION IN FORMULA ONE RACING\nThe centrality of technological innovation to economic development has meant that it provides\nan enduring basis for research and debate. Work in this area has developed from the economic\nprinciples of the production function (Abramovitz, 1956; Solow, 1957) to consideration of\nmanagerial processes (Burns and Stalker, 1961), and more recently, to connect innovative\nprocesses within the firm to the competitive dynamics within industries. Research has focused\non the concept of competitive strategy (Porter, 1983; Abernathy and Clark, 1985), dynamic\ncapability (Teece et al., 1997), institutions (Nelson and Winter, 1977) and coevolution\n(Levinthal, 1992; Van de Ven and Garud, 1994; Lewin and Volberda, 1999). Studies have\nconsidered the relationship between incumbents and new entrants (Christensen and Rosenbloom,\n1995), the relationship between innovators and followers (Lieberman and Montgomery, 1988),\nthe distinction between radical and incremental innovation (Banbury and Mitchell, 1995; Dewar\nand Dutton, 1986) and the implications of competing organizations sharing technologies\n(Abrahamson and Rosenkopf, 1993; Garud and Kumaraswamy, 1993; Wade, 1995; Cohen et al.\n2000).\nAll of these are important aspects of competitive dynamics and technological innovation.\nHowever, they raise questions about: (1) how evolution differs at relevant levels of analysis\n(technologies, firms, industries) and (2) how coevolutionary forces within or between these\nlevels affect the survival and dominance of technologies. These questions lie at the heart of the\nrelationship between technological innovation, competitive strategy and firm performance. They\nare challenging, however, because answering them implies complex theory and a rich set of\n2empirical observations. As one approach to this task, we employ an inductive, theory-building\nmethod that draws on archival data and contemporaneous accounts. Using Rosenkopf and\nNerkar\u2019s (1999) definition of analytical levels and Dosi\u2019s (1982) notion of technological\ntrajectory as theoretical lenses, we evaluate technology developments over fifteen years of\nFormula One racing.\nEnfolding theory with data leads to a set of propositions on the evolutionary forces acting on\ntechnological trajectories within each level of analysis. The resulting framework informs the\nrelationships between technological transparency, coevolution, and the emergence of dominant\ndesigns. Specifically, we argue that when the costs and difficulty associated with transferring\ncomponent knowledge between firms is low (technological transparency is high), technologies\ntend to coevolve across firms, leading to complementary technologies and increasing the\nlikelihood of industry dominance. When transparency is low, however, technologies tend to\ncoevolve across functions within firms, leading to competing technologies across firms and\nincreasing the likelihood of a technology\u2019s dominance within the firm. Moreover, the data and\nargument suggests that the forces acting on these two technological trajectories are self-\nreinforcing, so that as momentum builds behind a trajectory, it becomes more likely that its\nevolutionary path will end in either firm- or system-level dominance. In the discussion, we trace\nthe implications of the model for theories of competition in technologically intensive\nenvironments.\nTheoretical Background\nIn prior research, the role of technology in competition has been studied from at least three levels\nof analysis, focusing on technology itself (Dewar and Dutton, 1986), on firms (Teece et al.,\n31997) or on the industry (Abrahamson and Rosenkopf, 1993). Evolutionary theory is concerned\nwith explanation of processes where there are multiple units (individuals, firms, species, etc.)\ninteracting with an environment (Levinthal, 1992). Consistent with this perspective, Rosenkopf\nand Nekar (1999) propose three levels of analysis within which technological evolution can be\nobserved (Figure 1). First, at the system level, a community of organizations can be defined.\nHere, interactions between firms lead to the development of industry-wide standards and the co-\nordination of products. At this level, the evolution of technology may be influenced by\ninstitutional forces (1994) and competitive rivalry (Porter, 1980; 1998). Second, the community\nof actors within an organization defines the firm level of analysis. At this level, interactions\nbetween individuals and sub-units, lead to the integration of technologies to produce products or\nservices (Grant, 1996b). Technological evolution at this level is likely influenced by the\nboundedly rational decisions of managers (Levinthal and March, 1981) and by the structure and\nculture of the hierarchy (Conner and Prahalad, 1996). At the third level of analysis, component-\nspecific communities external to the firm can be identified. Within this level, interactions among\nindividuals and groups focus on the development of ideas and lead to the creation of the core\nknowledge (scientific basis) that forms the foundation of the product (Henderson and Clark,\n1990; Tushman and Murmann, 1998).\nINSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE\nRosenkopf and Nerkar (1999) stress the importance of coevolutionary effects both within and\nacross levels of the hierarchy. This concerns the inter-relationships between change at the\ncomponent, firm and system levels of analysis. Thus, for example, incremental evolution of\ntechnology within the firm may be associated with punctuated evolution at the system level\n(Rosenkopf and Nerkar, 1999). Coevolution may also be observed within a given level, as when\n4complementary technologies coevolve within firms or systems, for example. This multiple-level,\ncoevolutionary view highlights historically dependent relationships among the experiences that\ncomprise the development of technology in a competitive context.\nThe meta-level concept of \u201ctechnological trajectory\u201d (Dosi, 1982) offers a way to conceptualize\nthe flow of such developments. Trajectories describe the path of a moving object across space\nand time. Technological trajectories, therefore, may be defined as the series of path dependent\nexperiences that track with the evolution of a technology (Dierickx and Cool, 1989). We propose\ntechnological trajectories as the thread connecting one experience to another within and across\nlevels of analysis. Building on Dosi (1982), one can discern three key attributes of such\ntrajectories\u2014their power, momentum and degree of uncertainty.\nPower and momentum refer respectively to the degree of influence and impetus behind a\ntrajectory. Among other things, technologies may gain or loose influence and momentum from\nother technologies, and the relationships between technological trajectories may therefore be\ndescribed as complementary or competitive (1999). Complementary trajectories increase the\npower and momentum of another trajectory while competing trajectories reduce them. A high\ndegree of complementarity between two technologies may even lead to their convergence--where\nprogress in one domain fuses directly with progress in another (Levinthal, 1998). The result may\nbe acceleration of the constituent technologies, as illustrated by the momentum given to optics\nand electronics as the result of their convergence in fibre-optics (Kodama, 1992). In contrast,\ncompeting technologies tend to sap one another of power and momentum, because developments\nin one tend to come at the expense of developments in others. Over time, one trajectory is likely\n5to become dominant, thereby establishing a powerful position, and reducing the power and\nmomentum of alternatives (Abernathy and Clark, 1985). Consistent with this, Dosi (1982)\ndefines the strength of a trajectory by the number of other technologies that it excludes\nAt the system level, such dominant designs have the effect of stabilizing the technological\nfrontier, as firms accept a particular level of technical and economic performance in order to\nconform to the industry standard (Rosenkopf and Tushman, 1998). Similarly, dominance of a\ntechnology within a firm creates organizational inertia as members or sub-units vested in the\ntechnology use their centrality to control information and decision-making (Miller and Friesen,\n1980). This effect within firms has also been described as the development of a\n\u201cparadigm\u201d(Johnson, 1988), a term originally coined to describe the stability of scientific\nprogress at the component level, i.e. within scientific communities (Kuhn, 1962). Thus, dominant\ntechnological trajectories produce inertial forces at all three levels of analysis, thereby limiting\nchange to incremental developments that are consistent with the dominant design (Christensen\nand Bower, 1996).\nIn addition to power and momentum, uncertainty is the third key attribute of technological\ntrajectories. Early in the life cycle of competing technologies, before much momentum has\naccumulated behind any one trajectory, there is often no basis for determining which will\nbecome dominant (Anderson and Tushman, 1990). Over time, however, the uncertainties\nsurrounding the course of a trajectory are resolved and future developments become increasingly\npredictable, predictability being perhaps the most desirable feature of dominant designs.\n6In sum, the multi-level framework offered by Rosenkopf and Nerkar (Rosenkopf and Nerkar,\n1999) and the concept of technological trajectory (Dosi, 1982) provide a potentially useful way\nto describe the evolution of technology in a competitive context. This set of lenses suggests re-\nframing questions of technological coevolution as questions about the power, momentum and\npredictability of technological trajectories. More specifically, it suggests the following\nquestions: What are the sources of power and momentum for technological trajectories? How do\nthese differ within levels of analysis? What are the mechanisms of uncertainty resolution of\ntechnological trajectories? How do they differ according to level of analysis?\nMethodology\nKoza and Lewin (1998) outline how longitudinal case studies provide unique opportunities for\nempirical and theoretical interpretation. Our approach uses a detailed, historical case study to\nderive new insights about the above questions. The historical case-based perspective involves\nmatching patterns in the data with theoretical explanations (Yin, 1981). Studies that focus on\nmultiple technologies, at multiple levels of analysis, over a significant period of time have the\nadvantage of permitting comparisons between, as well as within, technological trajectories in the\nsearch for patterns. Fundamentally, however, even a single historical case may be a fruitful\nsource of explanation when it is accompanied by techniques such as theoretical sampling and\nenfolding appropriate literature (Eisenhardt, 1989). Some of the best examples of theory\ndevelopment draw on data from only one or a very few cases (Allison, 1971; Burgelman, 1983).\n7The first and most crucial step in such a design is the selection of the case(s). The principle\ncriterion is the theoretical usefulness of the data for observing relevant phenomena. This\n\u201ctheoretical sampling\u201d approach suggests the need for historical observations from firms\ncompeting in a technology-intensive environment. In this instance, we have used longitudinal\ndata of Formula One (F1) racing from 1967-1982 that combines industry, firm and component\nlevels of analysis. In prior work, data from F1 has provided a context for studies that consider the\nlocalization of expertise (Pinch and Henry, 1999; Aston and Williams, 1996) and the flow of\nknowledge between F1 racing and innovation in the motor industry (Foxall et al., 1992).\nToday F1 represents the pinnacle of automotive technology. The circuits used in the\nchampionship require cars that are both powerful and maneuverable; the industry has been\npunctuated by several technical revolutions in engine and car design. The pace and\ncompetitiveness of the industry is represented by the fact that no team or driver has won the\nchampionship consecutively more than four times over fifty years of competition.\nIn addition to technological intensity the research questions focus on relationships between\ntechnical developments and competitive outcomes. There are many factors that may explain\ncompetitive success, including industry and corporate effects (McGahan and Porter, 1997;\nRumelt, 1991), frequently, this makes it difficult to separate out the influence of technology on\ncompetition from these other influences. F1 provides an excellent objective measure of\ncompetitive performance - winning races. Whilst there are other success criteria that may be\naffected by technology (such as sales growth, safety record, TV coverage), race performance\n(represented by the accumulation of championship points in a given year) is unambiguously\naccepted within the industry as a key competitive outcome. Moreover, data relevant to\n8technological change is regularly reported in light of its effect on winning. Indeed, the history of\nthe industry is permeated with observations about the relationship between technology and\ncompetition. Many of these reports include the observers\u2019 \u201ctheories-in-use\u201d (Weick, 1995). This\nmixture of fact and opinion provides a good context to study the phenomena and develop new\ntheory.\nData for the study draws on a large archival database. The data is uniquely rich because F1 is the\nsubject of constant media attention and generates an enormous amount of written material\ndetailing the actual words and actions of industry players--both individuals as well as firms--all\nof which has been collected in an industry archive located at the in the southern region of the\nUnited Kingdom.1 Published sources of data include periodicals (Autosport, Motor Sport,\nRacecar Engineering), which provide full race-by-race accounts and detailed descriptions of the\n\u201cbehind the scenes\u201d activity of each team. This data is supplemented other accounts, including\nautobiographies of the key players to create a detailed chronological database. In order to verify\nthe data, the first author conducted a series of in-depth interviews with the senior managers of\nthe F1 teams included in the study to provide contemporaneous accounts of historical events. A\nsemi-structured scheme was used which asked the individuals to describe critical incidents\n(Campbell et al., 1970) and account for the performance of the team during the case period.\nAssertions made by the interviewee were probed using the \u2018laddering technique\u2019, where\nstatements are explored in terms of their saliency to the individual by using the \u2018why is that\nimportant?\u2019 question (Eden and Ackermann, 1998). This provides observations from individual\nactors within all three levels of analysis. Some of the data is commentary, but much is objective,\n1 BP Library of Motoring at the National Motor Museum. (Beaulieu), United Kingdom.\n9and in some cases, quantitative in nature. This multi-layered data is necessary and appropriate for\ninductive research (Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 1981).\nStudy Context\nThe first Grand Prix was run by the Auto Club de France in 1906, but it wasn\u2019t until 1950 that\nthe first world championship series was held linking the national races held in the UK, Monaco,\nUSA, Switzerland, Belgium, France and Italy. Whilst in many forms of motorsport the race\nteams buy in the chassis [a term used to describe all aspects of the car except the engine and\ngearbox], gearbox and engine, the F1 teams design, construct and race their own cars, gearboxes\nand in some cases their own engines. The term constructor is used to represent this combination\nof specialized capability. Whereas in the early 1950s automotive manufacturers such as\nMaserati, Mercedes-Benz and Alfa-Romeo populated F1, by the 1970s it had become the domain\nof specialist constructors, some of whom also produced high-performance road cars.\nThis study focuses on a period that begins with the development of the Ford DFV (Double-Four\nValve) engine in 1967 and includes the \u201cground-effect\u201d revolution of the late 1970s that came to\nan end in 1982. This period has been selected because it includes several technologies, which\nappear to vary in terms of key factors identified in the analytical framework, i.e. power,\nmomentum and uncertainty.\nCase Analysis\nThe first step in data analysis was to identify technological trajectories. To accomplish this, we\ndivided the data along three historical paths that reflect distinctive technological trajectories: (1)\n10\nthe events leading up to and including the dominance of the Ford DFV engine from 1967 - 1973,\n(2) the experience of Ferrari\u2019s unique \u201cFlat-12\u201d engine from 1974-1977, and (3) the activity\nsurrounding the revolution in aerodynamics and the emergence of Williams\u2019 dominant \u201cground-\neffect\u201d design (1978-1982).\nThe Ford DFV technology involved the use of a purpose-built, \u2018V8\u2019 configuration that enabled\nF1 constructors to acquire a highly competitive engine at a relatively low price. The significance\nof the engine was that it formed a structural element of the car and therefore reduced overall\nweight. The Ferrari \u201cFlat-12\u201d engine technology involved horizontal positioning of the pistons\nto create a wide, flat engine with a low center of gravity. It represented a radical departure from\ndesigns of the period. Ground-effect technology involved the use of the car\u2019s underside to create\nnegative lift. The change causes the car to hug the surface of the track and significantly improves\ncornering speed. Figure 2 illustrates the relative performance levels of these three technologies\nduring the period 1965-1982.\n[INSERT FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE.]\nSubsequent inferences in the study are highly sensitive to the definition of technological\ntrajectories. Our choice of the Ford DFV engine, Ferrari Flat-12 and ground-effect trajectories is\nthus a critical first step in the analysis. In making it, we considered opinions expressed in the\narchival data and in the interviews with team executives. There was very little disagreement that\nthese three represent key developments during the period, although not everyone agreed about\ntheir relative importance. For purposes of expositional clarity, the trajectories are bracketed by\n11\ndistinct sub-periods. Defining them in this way is not meant to suggest their independence,\nhowever, and the analysis of the data was seamless in the sense that we did not impose a priori\nconstraints on the time frame for each trajectory. Moreover, given our evolutionary framework,\nwe were especially alert to reports in the data suggesting connections between trajectories. Thus,\nwe recount the case data in three sub-periods and highlight any apparent relationships between\ndevelopments in one trajectory and those in another.\nThe Ford DFV Period (1967-1973)\nThe Ford DFV \u2018V8\u2019engine was first used competitively in a Lotus 49 at the Dutch Grand Prix in\n1967 and caused a sensation by winning its first race. The concept was not just about a better\nperforming engine. Rather, it was about using the engine as part of the car\u2019s structure, thus\nsubstituting for certain parts of the chassis and creating a lighter and well-powered racecar. The\nconcept of the DFV is illustrated in Figure 3.\n[INSERT FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE.]\nThe Ford DFV was created by a joint venture between the Ford Motor Company, who funded the\nproject, Cosworth Engineering, who designed and built the engine and Lotus Cars. Lotus\ndesigned and built the Lotus 49 around the engine during the 1967 season. The engine became\navailable to other teams in 1968, and quickly became a technological imperative.\n\u201c...for ten years that engine pretty well ruled the roost. Anyone with enough money, and in the\nfirst year[1968] it was only \u00a37,500, went to Cosworth and came away with an engine that was\ncapable of winning the next race. That went on for many years which is the reason why there\n12\nare so many British formula one teams, only that reason, only because that engine was\navailable\u201d (Interview with F1 Team Principal)\nIn 1968 Lotus were joined by McLaren and Matra in using the Ford DFV. The Brabham team\nfollowed in 1969. During the early seventies F1 was dominated by the Ford engined \u2018kit-car\u2019.\nThe term kit-car refers to the fact that the constructor designed and manufactured the chassis and\nsuspension while the engine and gearbox components were supplied from outside. In this case\n\u2018the kit\u2019 included the Ford DFV engine, manufactured by Cosworth Engineering, and the\ngearbox built by Hewland Engineering. In 1969 and 1973 a car with a Ford DFV engine won\nevery Grand Prix, the only occasion in the history of F1 that a single engine totally dominated a\nseason. Figure 2 illustrates its performance.\nThe Ferrari Renaissance 1974-1977\nThe availability of the Ford DFV meant that the constructors who were vertically integrated and\nbuilt their own engines and gearboxes, such as Ferrari and BRM, were at a disadvantage. Their\n\u2018in-house\u2019 capability appeared to be no longer valid. A merger with Fiat in 1969 provided a\nhuge injection of cash and resources for Ferrari, and this allowed the design and construction of a\nnew larger 12 cylinder engine with the cylinders horizontally opposed, creating a powerful, wide\nengine with a low center of gravity, referred to as a \u2018Flat-12\u2019. The configuration of the Flat-12 is\ncontrasted with the V8 in Figure 4.\n[INSERT FIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE.]\n13\nFerrari had historically seen the engine as the critical aspect of racecar performance:\n\u2018Horsepower was everything to Mr. Ferrari and, following his lead, to most of his engineers.\nHandling was secondary. Engines to the fore \u2013 chassis were regarded merely as brackets to\nprevent the wheels falling off and to carry the driver and the fuel load.\u2019 (Nye, 1998). The new\nengine enabled some progress, with a promising performance in 1970, but this was not sustained\ndue to problems with reliability.\nHowever, the huge investment in R&D had included the building of the first purpose-built F1\ntest track at Fiorano, northern Italy in 1971. In 1973, founder Enzo Ferrari, who had been\nsuffering from ill-health, appointed an understudy to take on the day to day management of the\nteam. Luca di Montezemolo, a 25 year old lawyer, was an unlikely lieutenant to Il\nCommendatore. Many, now see him, however, to have been the catalyst for Ferrari\u2019s most\nsuccessful period since the 1950s. Montezemolo made some major personnel and managerial\nchanges, including the recruitment of a young driver (Niki Lauda) who worked closely with\nMauro Forghieri\u2014the chief designer behind the development of the \u2018Flat-12\u2019 engine. This\npartnership culminated in the 312T car which used the \u2018Flat-12\u2019 in combination with Ferrari\u2019s\nown unique transverse [mounted across the car] gearbox. Ferrari concentrated on an exhaustive\ndevelopment program at Fiorano to ensure that the concept would be reliable as well as fast. The\nconsequence was that, for the first time since 1967, the Ford DFV constructors were seriously\nchallenged.\n\u201cSimilarly, nobody can claim to have really expected the renaissance of the Ferrari team. It was\nonly the middle of last season that the Italians were staying home from races and having open\n14\ndisagreements with their star driver. They seemed to be working on the wrong lines both\nmechanically and managerially. Yet over the winter they have put everything right, revised both\nmachines and management, and were a threat right from the first race in January.\u201d Pete Lyons,\nAutosport, July 4, 1974, p35\nThe renaissance of Ferrari meant that the teams using the Ford DFV were being challenged by a\nradically different and unique approach to racecar construction. This produced a number of\ndiffering responses. In the case of the Brabham team it seemed that the logical response was to\nmove away from the Ford DFV.\n\u201cHalfway through that year [1975] it was pretty obvious that a twelve cylinder engine \u2013 because\nFerrari didn\u2019t have any other magic at the time; they just powered away on all the quick circuits\n\u2013was going to end the reign of the [Ford] DFV. It was obvious that you had to have more than\neight cylinders. And so we started looking around for a twelve.\u201d (Former Technical Director\nBrabham)\nBrabham reached an agreement with Alfa Romeo to supply a \u2018Flat-12\u2019 engine developed by\nengine specialist Carlo Chiti. This decision had major implications for the team and the design\nof the car.\n\u201cThe BT45 [Brabham\u2019s first car with the Alfa Romeo engine] was a completely new car. It was\na Flat-12 engine, it was a non-structural engine [the engine did not form part of the chassis as\nwith the Ford DFV], so it was a total rethink and I had six months to design and build a Flat-12\nAlfa car for the beginning of the \u201876 season.\u201d (Former Technical Director Brabham)\n15\nIn contrast, two other constructors - Tyrrell and Lotus - retained the Ford DFV, but developed a\nmore radical chassis in order to increase performance. Tyrrell developed a six-wheeled car with\nfour small wheels at the front designed to improve aerodynamic penetration and to the area of\ntire gripping surface. The Tyrrell P34 was announced in 1975 and first raced in 1976.\n\u201cIt was becoming apparent to me that the Ford engine had lost its edge, I mean that it was still\nproducing the same horsepower, but with the success of the Ferrari, the possible success of\nengines like Matra or anybody else who came along with a Flat-12, V12 or 12 cylinder\nwhatever, you\u2019re going to be outclassed apart from that you\u2019ve got the same [Ford] engine as\nmany other teams, so you\u2019ll be scratching for a little bit here and a bit there and I wanted to\nmake a big breakthrough.\u201d . (Former Technical Director Tyrrell)\nLotus also focused on the aerodynamics of the chassis and in 1977 introduced the first \u2018ground-\neffect\u2019 car, the Lotus 78, an approach that was enormously successful.\nThe Ground-Effect Revolution 1978-1982\nThe original development of aerodynamics in racecars had involved the use of \u2018wings\u2019 or\nexternal aerofoils to create downforce which improves grip. In contrast, the ground-effect\nconcept uses the underbody of the car, rather than the upper body or wings, to create a low\npressure area, thereby holding the car to the ground and allowing it to travel at far greater speeds\nwhen cornering. Two tunnels (or venturi) run along the sides of the car and widen out towards\n16\nthe rear, thereby reducing the pressure and creating a suction effect as the air runs under the car.\nThe principles of ground-effect are summarized in Figure 5.\n[INSERT FIGURE 5 ABOUT HERE.]\nIn 1974 Lotus team owner Colin Chapman asked his Technical Director to take a look at the\nentire concept of a racecar to see where the performance gains could be made. The Technical\nDirector, along with a specialist aerodynamicist, explored the prospect of producing ground-\neffect in an F1 car. These two individuals had experimented with these ideas almost ten years\nearlier when they both worked for BRM. Whilst ground-effect had been developed as a\ntheoretical concept, practical application in F1 was still unresolved. This was achieved by a\nbreakthrough in using \u2018skirts\u2019 - strips down the sides of the car that effectively sealed the area\nunderneath. As with many great discoveries this came almost by accident.\n\u201c...until one day the [wind-tunnel] model was so decrepit we started getting variable results. It\nwould be modified so often, it was made of card and plastic and clay and tape and what have\nyou. We got inconsistent results and we couldn\u2019t figure out why and then I noticed that the side\npods were sagging and we thought, well what\u2019s sagging got to do with it? We thought maybe it\u2019s\nthe gap at the edge [between the car and the ground], so we put some card down the edge in a\nlittle tiny gap and wumph! We couldn\u2019t believe it! We had to re-do [the test] four times before\nwe believed it.\u201d Former Lotus Aerodynamicist.\nIt was the Lotus design that proved to be the most successful innovation, winning the\nconstructors championship in 1978 by a significant margin. Founder Colin Chapman had been\nresponsible for introducing a number of innovations borrowed from aircraft technology such as\n17\nthe monocoque chassis and had been a prime mover in the Ford DFV project. In contrast to\nFerrari\u2019s focus on engine horsepower, Lotus had always concentrated on chassis development for\ntechnical advancement. In addition Chapman\u2019s involvement in the development of the Ford\nDFV made it unlikely that he would follow Brabham and seek an alternative engine source:\n\u201cColin wouldn\u2019t consider departing from the Cosworth engine because of the links with Lotus\n[Cosworth founders Keith Duckworth and Mike Costin had both worked for Lotus in the early\nsixties]. He was also very patriotic and would always want a British engine in his cars.\u201d\n(Former Technical Director of Lotus)\nThe Lotus 78 established ground-effect technology and many constructors attempted to imitate\nthe design. Here imitation was more practical as the majority was using the same engine\nconfiguration as Lotus [Ford DFV] and therefore had only to concentrate on re-design of the\nchassis. What was particularly significant about ground-effect was that Ferrari\u2019s commitment to\na Flat-12 engine meant that they were unable to create the narrow under-body profile needed to\nlocate the ground-effect venturi either side of the engine. The narrow Ford V8 was ideally suited\nto this application, whereas the wide Flat-12 engine meant that there was no space for the\nventuri. The same problem also applied to Brabham who had shifted to the Alfa Romeo Flat-12\nin 1976.\n\u201cThe basic car was, in the end, quite quick, the engine was good, the aerodynamics were good,\nand we had a mini recovery, and then we had a slap back right in the middle of that \u2013 ground-\neffect. So now we\u2019re stuck with a meter wide Flat-12 engine right where the [ground-effect]\nventuri tail wants to start lifting.\u201d (former technical director, Brabham)\n18\nThis problem prompted Brabham\u2019s Technical Director to develop the ground-effect in a car with\na Flat-12 engine.\nWe were sitting there racking our brains thinking how else can we have downforce with a Flat-\n12 engine. The Fan Car bought us time to go back to Alfa and say we need a V12 engine in\nthree months for the beginning of the 78 season. And so we had another complete start again\nduring the 77 season.\u201d (former technical director, Brabham)\nThe Fan-Car was an attempt to resolve the problem by creating \u2018artificial\u2019 ground-effect using a\nmechanical fan attached to the rear of the car that sucked the air from underneath. The Brabham\nBT46B \u2018fan-car\u2019 was a product of this innovative period and won the Swedish Grand Prix in\n1978. Ultimately, it was banned because it was deemed to be outside the regulations and\nbecause of the alleged danger to drivers from debris being sucked through the fan.\nWhilst Brabham were attempting to find ways to achieve ground-effect with a Flat-12 engine,\nFerrari appeared to ignore the phenomena and concentrated on developing their engine and\nchassis along the same lines as 1974. This however left them hopelessly uncompetitive against\nthe ground-effect cars. \u201cMaranello\u2019s [location of Ferrari factory] Flat-12, still a magnificent\nracing engine, is incompatible with modern chassis. [Drivers] Villeneuve and Scheckter were\ncompeting in yesterday\u2019s cars.\u201d Roebuck (1980). It wasn\u2019t until the appointment of a new\nSenior Engineer who had previously designed ground-effect cars that the extent of Ferrari\u2019s\nmyopia became clear. \u201cEveryone else had them [ground-effect aerodynamics] for years, but\n19\nuntil I arrived [1981] it was quite firmly believed that they didn\u2019t exist.\u201d (Former Senior\nEngineer, Ferrari)\nFollowing the success of the Lotus 78, Colin Chapman sought to move the concept forward with\nthe more complex Lotus 79 and the Lotus 80. In the Lotus 80, the concept was to increase the\nground-effect to the extent that the car needed no external wings, but this proved to be less\ncontrollable on the track. In an effort to resolve the problem, Chapman and his design team\ndeveloped a revolutionary twin chassis car, the Lotus 88. The 88 was, however, the subject of\nprotests by all the major teams, and in 1981, the governing body banned the design.\nWilliams Grand Prix Engineering (WGPE), formed in 1973, was a relatively new, low budget\noperation. Designer, Patrick Head, imitated the ground-effect concept developed by Lotus, but\nin a way that was consistent with stringent financial limitations. It proved to be a simple, but\nhighly effective interpretation of the concept. Whilst the Lotus 80 found the limit of applying\nthe ground-effect concept, the Williams FW07 was considered to be the optimal application of\nthe concept to a Formula 1 car.\n\u201c..he [Chapman] thought that they [Williams] had made a better quality job of his original\nconcept. I think he felt that the construction of the cars was probably better than ours.\u201d\n(Former Chief Mechanic, Lotus)\nFollowing on from the ground-effect revolution a number of constructors had begun to look at\nalternative materials to use in the construction of the car. Ground-effect worked most effectively\nwhen the car was totally rigid; if there were too much flexing of the chassis then this would\n20\ndestabilize the ground-effect. This problem became evident to the technical team at Lotus when\nthey saw a slow motion television shot of one of their cars at the Monaco Grand Prix: \u201c..the car\nwas coming in to view down the hill in slow motion and as it came round the corner it seemed\nalive, the whole car was like a snake, we realized that it just shouldn\u2019t be doing that, that\u2019s not a\nstable platform to work the car from.\u201d (Former Technical Director of Lotus)\nA change of chassis construction from aluminum to carbon fiber solved the problem. Brabham\nwere the first team to use carbon fiber as part of their chassis, but it was McLaren in 1980 who\ncame up with the first full carbon composite monocoque. Using specialist composite fabricator\nHercules the McLaren team were the first team to involve a specialist to build their entire\nmonocoque. \u201cthe next day we got on a plane with the drawings, with the model in the overhead\nlocker, and off we went to Salt Lake City and that was it \u2013 just like that it developed to Hercules\nbuilding the first monocoque for us.\u201d (Former Technical Director, McLaren).\nWe have attempted to distill some of the key aspects of the development of this industry during\nthe period 1967-1982. Table 1 summarizes these as they relate to each of three levels of analysis\noutlined in Figure 1.\nINSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE\nCompetitive Dynamics of Technological Trajectories\nTable 2 reviews the description of technological trajectories that our case analysis\nsuggests. Rows identify the level of analysis, and columns show the attributes or dimensions of\ntechnological trajectories suggested by the analytical framework. The three levels of analysis are\n21\n\u201cnested\u201d within one another, such that systems are comprised of multiple firms and firms are\ncomprised of multiple component technologies. Columns represent a logic where trajectories in\nphysical objects start as the result of an application of physical force. We have labelled such\nforce \u201cpower,\u201d because in a technological trajectory, velocity appears to depend on the degree of\ninfluence wielded by the technology, i.e. the extent to which it affects the behaviour of actors\nwithin the communities at each level of analysis. (Interestingly, this relationship does not appear\nto be a linear one, as will be discussed below.) Following the logic of the metaphor, momentum\naccelerates the velocity of a trajectory, and this, too, appears to differ according to the nature of\ninfluence within level of analysis. Finally, like physical trajectories, actors within each\ncommunity attempt to influence the direction of technological development. Hence, the third\ncolumn suggests the decision-making or uncertainty resolution mechanisms employed at each\nlevel.\nINSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE\nSources of Power, Momentum and Uncertainty Resolution\nAll knowledge begins within individuals (Grant, 1996b; Nonaka, 1994; Spender, 1996), we\ntherefore begin the description of trajectories at the component level, the world of ideas, where\nthe community\u2019s key concern is the development of knowledge. Actors at this level of analysis\ninclude, for example, the design team within Cosworth who developed the Ford DFV, Mauro\nForghieri and the design group within Ferrari who produced the Flat-12 engine and the Technical\nDirector and aerodynamicist at Lotus who developed the ground-effect concept. At these early\nstages, trajectories are relatively uncontaminated by other forms of knowledge or interests. As\nthe aerodynamicist at Lotus suggested, the source of an idea\u2019s power at this point is its ability to\n22\ndemonstrate \u201ca better way of doing things.\u201d As a concept \u201cproves\u201d itself along these lines, it\ngains increasing attention and influence within the community. Proof of concept, however, relies\non methods and approaches that are grounded in a particular belief system. A trajectory\u2019s ability\nto get started, therefore, may be restrained by its lack of fit with the dominant paradigm (Kuhn,\n1962). Thus, for example, it took nearly a decade for an idea from aerodynamics to be accepted\nin racecar design. But in Ferrari, the development of the Flat-12 engine was launched directly\nfrom the organization\u2019s collective belief in engines. In each case, the strength of an idea lies in\nits ability to solve a particular problem, thereby ruling out alternatives (Dosi, 1982) and focusing\nactivity around a given technical direction.\nProposition 1: Technological trajectories start at the component level as the\nresult of this community\u2019s belief in the problem-solving potential of a new\nidea.\nAt the firm level, a trajectory appears to gain influence by creating inter-dependencies with\ncomponent technologies already in place. Adoption of the Ford DFV engine, for example,\nrequired radical changes in chassis design to take advantage of its structural features. In Ferrari,\n\u201chorsepower was everything\u201d (Nye, 1998), and thus everything was built around the engine,\nincluding the chassis design and gearbox. Indeed, the power of Ferrari\u2019s commitment to engines,\nundermined consideration of the ground-effect concept, while Lotus\u2019 focus on the chassis\nprovided an ideal environment for the idea to take hold. These and the relative power of one\ncomponent over others, therefore, seem to be based on the number and strength of inter-\ndependencies it creates with other technologies. The concept of inter-dependencies as a source of\npower within the firm is consistent with knowledge-based theories of the firm wherein\nhierarchies are seen principally as mechanisms for integrating and applying the knowledge of\n23\ntechnical specialists (Conner and Prahalad, 1996; Grant, 1996a). In addition, the number and\nstrength of inter-dependencies has been shown to be a source of influence in studies of intra-\norganizational power (Hinings et al., 1974).\nProposition 2: Technological trajectories take hold and gain power within\nfirms by virtue of the number and strength of inter-dependencies they create\nwith other component technologies.\nAt the system level, the power of a trajectory appears to be related to the level of consensus\namong firms, and in particular, the degree to which firms agree about the value of a technology\nto their (individual) success. For example, the Ford DFV engine emerged as the agreed upon\ndesign for Lotus, McLaren, Matra and Brabham in less than two years. Similarly, the influence\nof ground-effect was represented by rapid widespread adoption within the system. Both these\ntechnologies became dominant designs at the system level. Ferrari\u2019s Flat-12 design, in contrast,\ngained very little power at the system level with only one other team (Brabham) moving in a\nsimilar direction. The difference appears to be the extent that the technologies were perceived as\na viable means of improving performance. Importantly, however, these perceptions about what\ncreates success were bounded by higher order norms within the system, so that, for example,\ntrajectories that are outside regulatory norms (like the Brabham fan car) develop very little power\nat the system level. This explanation resonates with an institutional theorists\u2019 explanation of\ntechnological evolution wherein adoption is driven by collective belief, social norms and formal\nregulations (Scott, 1995).\nProposition 3: The power of a technological trajectory at the system level is\nrooted in the degree of consensus among key actors within firms about the\n24\ntechnology\u2019s role in performance, which is influenced and constrained by\nsocial norms and regulations.\nMomentum develops as the result of additional or reinforcing applications of power. Thus, the\ntheoretical arguments for power contain within them an explanation for how momentum\ndevelops at each level (Table 1). At the component level, momentum is gained by technical\nachievement. This may be defined within the paradigm then operating or, in rare cases, by a\nrevolutionary approach (Kuhn, 1962). At the firm level, actors are concerned with more than\ntechnical achievement, however, and a trajectory\u2019s momentum at this level is accelerated by a\nbelief within the firm that it can achieve a broader range of goals. Thus, critical inter-\ndependencies may be created by a technology when it is seen to contribute to survival (Aldrich,\n1979), stakeholder satisfaction (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978), economic profit and other\nperformance-related goals. At the system level, momentum-building processes are similarly\ngrounded in the perceptions of actors, here the consensus about a technology emerges as a\nlegitimation process, wherein links to performance are defined on the basis of observed\nsuccesses as constrained by formal and informal norms of the community (Scott, 1995).\nProposition 4: The momentum of technological trajectories is accelerated by\nperceptions among actors at the component level that the solution\ncontributes to technical achievement, at the firm-level that it contributes to\ngoal achievement and at the system level that it contributes to social\nlegitimacy.\nThus, the momentum created behind the Ford DFV engine at the system level developed as the\nbelief spread that anyone with enough money could go to Cosworth and come away with an\nengine that was capable of winning races. Ferrari\u2019s investments in the Flat-12 engine accelerated\nas it was seen to be the key to the team\u2019s renaissance\u2014not only in technical performance but in\n25\nrebuilding the team\u2019s status and prestige among key stakeholders (owners, sponsors, publics).\nFinally, although the ground-effect concept was initially impeded at the component level because\nit did not fit the paradigm, once the dramatic improvements it made in performance were\nunderstood, it spurred a revolution in chassis design within the technical community.\nThe description of technological trajectories would not be complete without identifying the\nmeans that actors use to resolve uncertainties about the trajectory\u2019s path. Resolution of such\nuncertainties becomes important as actors individually or collectively attempt to anticipate the\nfuture course of events and shape them in ways that contribute to their perceived self-interest.\nThese efforts imply a desire to understand and influence the direction and\/or velocity of the\ntechnology\u2019s development. Thus, uncertainty-reducing and decision-making processes within\neach level can be described in accordance with the explanations of power and momentum.\nConsistent with the institutional explanations of consensus at the system level, political\nprocesses, including negotiation, bargaining and compromise are the chief means by which\nactors settle differences and come to a consensus about the role of a particular technology (Scott,\n1995). At the firm-level, technological uncertainties are reduced as boundedly rational actors\nattempt to make judgments about the means to achieve organizational goals (Simon, 1957).\nFinally, at the component level, where science and engineering concerns dominate, the principal\nof uncertainty reduction is learning, most often in the form of experimentation.\nProposition 5A: Experimental learning processes are used to reduce\nuncertainty and make decisions related to technological trajectories at the\ncomponent level.\nProposition 5B: Boundedly rational decision making processes are the\nsource of uncertainty reduction at the firm level.\n26\nProposition 5C: Political processes in the form of bargaining, negotiation\nand compromise govern decision-making and uncertainty-reduction at the\nsystem level.\nThus, for example, at the component level, the development of ground-effect technology\nfollowed a path of numerous experiments by designers within Lotus, Brabham, Williams and\nothers. Learning occurred at the component level as one iteration won out over the rest, and\nultimately, Williams\u2019 formula proved optimal. The evolution of ground-effect technology was\nalso shaped by decisions to adopt it at the firm level. In each case, these decisions are based not\nonly on actors\u2019 attempts to improve performance, but also, on the resource and other constraints\nimposed by unique firm goals. Thus, Ferrari and Brabham attempted to adapt the technology to\nsuit larger engines, while Williams adapted it to fit their financial constraints. Finally, the\npolitical processes at the system level\u2014that occurred within the regulatory body (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration\nInternationale de l\u2019Automobile -FIA) and among its members (the constructors)\u2014led to\nagreements about how ground-effect should be constrained, including the ban on the use of\n\u201cartificial\u201d means, i.e. Brabham\u2019s Fan-Car.\nIn sum, technological trajectories are social phenomena, created and sustained by belief within\nthe relevant communities of action. Sociological processes within each community affect their\ngrowth, velocity and direction. Good explanations for their development therefore include the\nsociology of science (Kuhn, 1962), bounded rationality (Simon, 1957) and institutional\nmechanisms (Scott, 1995). This description offers a synthesis of the evolutionary forces affecting\ntechnology trajectories at different levels of analysis. By itself, however, it does not add to what\nwe know about how a technology evolves into a position of dominance. Indeed, institutional and\ncompetitive influences on this process have been described in prior research (Abrahamson and\n27\nRosenkopf, 1993). Nor does the framework address questions about the coevolution of\ntechnology. In the next section, however, we suggest an explanation of dominance that, while\nconsistent with prior theory, moves beyond earlier models--tracing the roots of dominance to the\nnature and coevolution of component technologies. To do so requires animating our discussion\nby tracing a trajectory\u2019s path within and between the levels of analysis.\nTracing the Paths of Technological Trajectories\nPower explains the impetus and velocity of technological trajectories, but what governs their\ndirection? Figure 6 suggests that the relative transparency of component knowledge plays a key\nrole in determining the coevolutionary forces that direct a technology\u2019s development. The nature\nof these coevolutionary forces (primarily within or between firms), then, explains whether a\ntechnology\u2019s path is more likely to end in firm- or system-level dominance.\nINSERT FIGURE 6 ABOUT HERE\nConsistent with prior theory (Kogut and Zander, 1992), we define transparency as the cost and\ndifficulty involved in transferring technology among individuals. Distinct from inimitability\n(Barney, 1991), which describes a similar phenomenon between firms, we reserve the concept of\ntransparency to the component level. It is therefore associated with codifiability (Boisot, 1998;\nWinter, 1987) and the extent to which component knowledge can be easily shared among\ntechnical specialists (Wade, 1995).\n28\nAs the figure shows, when component technology is transparent, critical knowledge elements are\neasily shared among technical professionals within firms. Under conditions of competitive\nrivalry and demand for new products, knowledge diffusion leads to multiple applications of the\ntechnology within firms. The technology changes as it is adapted to idiosyncratic firm goals and\nas it is fused with other path dependent processes (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990; Nelson and\nWinter, 1977; Rosenkopf and Nerkar, 1999). These variations coevolve across rival firms as\nsome applications compete more successfully than others.\nIn addition, firm-level processes that serve to bundle the component technology in different ways\nstimulate additional variety in the form of complementary technologies. Some of these arise from\nother functions or divisions within the firm. As the technology is adopted widely at the system\nlevel, still other complementary technologies develop through relationships with outside\norganizations (e.g. suppliers). Thus, a high level of transparency tends to push technology\ndevelopment in the direction of coevolution across firms (inter-firm coevolution). Transparency\nstimulates variety between firms, as well as within them. This coevolutionary process may lead\nto dominance of the technology at the industry level.\nThe Ford DFV engine offers the best example of transparent component technology in the\nFormula One data. Ford and Cosworth provided detailed engineering drawings and technical\nassistance to virtually any team that was willing and able to pay for them. However, there was\nstill a great deal of variation among firms in terms of how the technology was applied. The\ncoevolution of these alternative interpretations produced an increasingly refined approach\nsupported by the development of many complementary technologies\u2014both of which further\n29\nreinforced adoption within the industry. In the end, the technology was judged within most firms\nto be \u201cthe only way to compete,\u201d i.e. it was the dominant industry design.\nWhen transparency is low, diffusion of ideas within the technical community proceeds more\nslowly. Sometimes real interest is limited to only one or a few individuals or groups. Often these\npeople are concentrated in a particular firm, whose goals and history happen to align with the\ntechnology, and sometimes, the firm\u2019s goals and\/or culture create the technology. Whether in one\nor a few firms, then, the technology tends to take hold. Coevolutionary processes are primarily\nbased in the interactions between the new technology and existing component technologies\nwithin individual firms. Once technologies become integrated across functions and embedded in\nthe organizational routine, coevolutionary forces within particular firms tend to decrease\ntransparency even further because the knowledge associated with the technology becomes more\ntacit (Nelson and Winter, 1977; Nonaka, 1994).\nThis inimitability may be good for competitive advantage (Barney, 1991), but it limits inter-firm\ncoevolution and the development of complementary technologies. Trajectories that go down this\npath, then, are not likely to reach dominance at the system level. Where the technology is\nparticularly critical to firm goals, however, it might be said that such technologies may lead to\nfirm-level dominance. This dominance is significant because it leads to sub-unit power and\nfunctional orientation which, in turn, may influence firm goals and the assimilation\/creation of\nnew technologies.\n30\nFerrari\u2019s Flat-12 engine was clearly not transparent to designers in other firms. In some\nrespects this was a result of the fact that the technology originated within Ferrari. Indeed,\nit is likely that the level of transparency in a component technology varies depending on\nits origin. (Note the feedback loops in Figure 6). If it comes from an established technical\ndiscipline, such as aerodynamics, it is more likely to be highly codified and thus\ntransparent. If it comes from a relatively small group of engineers within a single firm\nwhere there is less need to be explicit, however, the technology is less likely to be\ncodified. The Flat-12 originated within the Ferrari culture, and lack of transparency\nlimited coevolution between firms. Complementary technologies were impeded, and\nalthough it became dominant within the firm, the Flat-12 never became dominant at the\nsystem level, despite the efforts of Brabham to adopt the technology.\nThus,\nProposition 6: The transparency of new component technologies affects the\ndirection of their development: higher levels increasing interactions between\nfirms and lower levels increasing coevolutionary processes across functions\nor divisions within firms.\nProposition 7: Technological coevolution between firms increases the number\nand variety of complementary technologies while technological coevolution\nwithin firms limits the number and variety of complementary technologies.\nProposition 8: Highly transparent component technologies are more likely to\nbecome dominant at the system level.\nConclusion\nIn summary we develop two central themes concerning the nature of technological\ninnovation and the evolution of dominant designs. The first is the differences in terms of\n31\npower, momentum and uncertainty reduction in trajectories at differing levels of analysis.\nClarifying such differences helps us to disaggregate some of the complexity and inter-\ndependencies within the innovative process. As a consequence, we are able to present a\nseries of fine-grained propositions concerning the nature of technological evolution. The\nsecond is the concept of technological transparency and its role in either generating the\ncomplementary technologies necessary for systems level acceptance (dominant design) or\nbuilding firm level dominance and competitive advantage amongst competing\norganizations.\nThe concept of technological transparency also underlines the contrasts between the\ndevelopment of intra-firm proprietary technologies and inter-firm technologies that\ncoevolve at the industry level. The tension between these underlines the importance of a\ndynamic, multi-level model. Each level of analysis provides a distinctive source of\nmomentum. Firms\u2019 seek to achieve their particular goals and develop technologies that\nprovide advantage through superior individual technologies and the synergies created by\ninter-dependencies across technologies. Component level-communities seek to ensure\nthe dominance of a particular technological solution and the achievement of\ntechnological outcomes. In contrast, the system seeks balance and legitimacy in how the\ntechnology performs--along political, economic and social dimensions.\nThe strength and direction of a trajectory evolves across levels of analysis. Trajectories\ntake shape first at the component level (technological trajectory) and may develop later at\nthe systems level (socio-technological trajectory). At the firm level, they are influenced\n32\nby an architecture of inter-dependent technologies (Henderson and Clark, 1990). The\ntensions and contrasts between levels--the need to reconcile technological imperatives\nwith firm level goals and systems level acceptance\u2014create momentum and drive the\ntrajectory\u2019s development.\n33\nTable 1: Summary of Key Aspects of Case Outline\nFord DFV Period\n1967-1973\nFerrari Renaissance\n1974-1977\nGround-effect Revolution\n1978-1982\nSystem-level\ncommunity\nFord DFV becomes\nthe basis of dominant\ndesign;\nwith complementary\ndesigns in gearbox\nand chassis\nPeriod of ferment\nand variation\nbetween Ford DFV\nand Ferrari Flat-12\nGround-effect becomes\naccepted standard, including\nuse of \u2018skirts\u2019\nFirm-level\ncommunity\nAlliance between\nLotus and Cosworth\ncreate Ford DFV but\ntechnology is easily\nacquired by\ncompeting firms\nFirms either\ninnovate (6 wheel\nTyrrell; ground-\neffect Lotus) or\nimitate \u2013 Brabham\nwith Alfa Romeo\nengine\nLotus develop innovation but\nothers follow and imitate\nconcepts\nComponent-level\ncommunity\nDevelopment of\nengine and related\ncomponents\nDistinction between\nengine driven\ninnovation; and\nchassis driven\ninnovation\nDevelopment of ground-\neffect aerodynamics and\nrelated materials (carbon\ncomposite); concept of Flat-\n12 engine undermined by\nneed for underbody venturi\n34\nTable 2:\nSources of power, momentum and uncertainty resolution within technological trajectories\nat the system-, firm- and component-levels of analysis\nSources of\nPower\nSources of\nMomentum\nUncertainty\nResolution Process\nSystem-level community Consensus Legitimacy\n(Dominant Design)\nPolitics\nFirm-level community Technical Inter-\ndependencies\nGoal achievement Bounded rationality\nComponent-level\ncommunity\nDevelopment of the\ntechnological\nparadigm\nTechnical\nachievement\nExperimentation\n35\nFigure 1: Levels of Analysis of Technological Evolution (Rosenkopf and Nerkar, A. 1999)\nSystem-Level Community\nFirms\nComponent-Specific\nCommunities\n36\nFigure 2: Relative Performance of Racecar Technologies\nNote: The vertical axis represents the relative race performance of a particular technology based on championship points accumulated during the year.
