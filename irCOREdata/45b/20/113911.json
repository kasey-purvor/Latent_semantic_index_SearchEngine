We\nanalyse gender differences in such views, based on audio-recorded interviews with 33 men and 36\nwomen (aged 65-93) in south-east England.  Older women were twice as likely as men to oppose\nusing medical technologies to extend life.  More older women voiced \u2018other-oriented\u2019 reasons for\ntheir opposition, particularly not wanting to be a burden on others.  Older men\u2019s attitudes were\nprimarily \u2018self-oriented\u2019, reflecting a concern to stay alive for as long as possible, with fewer\nexpressing concern about consequences for others.  Women\u2019s greater life course involvement in\ncaring and empathising with the wishes and concerns of others underlay these gender differences.\nThus, women were \u2018performing gender\u2019 by putting others before themselves, even at this critical\njuncture in their lives.\nKeywords\nGender,  Life-prolonging medical technologies, Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, Older people\nIntroduction\nHitherto there has been a separation between the concerns of writers on anti-aging medicine (cf.\nVincent 2006, papers in this special issue), and research regarding life-prolonging medical\ntechnologies.  Medical technologies are increasingly available to extend the final stages of life.\nHowever, controversies abound over using technologies, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation,\nventilation and artificial feeding, which may simultaneously extend life, but can also result in a\npoor quality of the end stages of life and dying with lack of dignity.\nBoth the anti-aging literature and research on decision-making at the end-of-life implicitly\nsubscribe to a rhetoric of the choices of atomised individuals about use of anti-aging medicines or\nlife-prolonging medical technologies.  Within the anti-aging literature concerns are raised about\nsocial inequalities, particularly how wealth and income may facilitate or prevent access to life\nenhancing technologies (Vincent 2006). Both fields have neglected to what extent the \u2018choices\u2019 of\nindividuals may be bounded by social or cultural factors, including how gender may be associated\nwith fundamental values and attitudes related to life extension. Since older people are the primary\nsubjects of life-prolonging medical technologies, it is particularly salient to hear their voices and\npreferences, especially within a societal context of freely available health care, such as the British\nNational Health Service.  By using interviews to closely analyse the views of older people about\nlife-prolonging medical technologies, this paper complements the papers by Settersen et al. and by\nMykytyn (in this issue) which use qualitative interviews to examine the perspectives of scientists\nengaged in biogerontological research and anti-aging practitioners respectively.\nA health policy concern over recent years has been to increase control and autonomy over\ndecision-making at the end-of-life, for example by encouraging use of \u2018Do-Not-Attempt-to-\nResuscitate\u2019 (DNAR) orders and Living Wills or Advance Directives (Duffield and\nPodzansky 1996, Rodriguez and Young 2006, Carr and Khodyakov 2007).   This medical policy\ndevelopment has conceptualised patients as independent and autonomous subjects, rather than as\ngendered persons. A neglected issue is to what extent an individual\u2019s expressed wishes about end-\nof-life care are influenced by their social characteristics, such as their gender, and their life course\nexperiences.\nIn the UK, the British Medical Association (2001) has introduced guidelines related to DNAR\norders (that is, an advance decision that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should not be\nattempted). Under these guidelines the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether to attempt\nresuscitation lies with the doctor in charge of the patient\u2019s care.   The guidelines specify that the\ndoctor should have ascertained the wishes of the patient in advance.  However, this is fraught with\ndifficulties where patients are hospitalised in a critical condition, or where the patient lacks the\nmedical capacity to indicate their wishes.   In these circumstances, the alternatives are either that\nthe patient has previously specified their wishes through an \u2018Advance Directive\u2019 or a \u2018Living\nWill\u2019, or that the patient\u2019s family members are consulted and represent the \u2018interests\u2019 of the\npatient.\nDespite the increasing importance of NHS guidelines that staff should involve patients and their\nfamilies in decisions about resuscitation, there has been little sociological research in this area.\nIndeed, Conroy et al. (2006: 480) state \u2018This area is under-researched and relatively little is known\nabout the attitudes towards cardiopulmonary resuscitation among frail elderly people\u2019.\nGender and attitudes to life-prolonging technologies\nMost studies of the attitudes of older people to life-prolonging medical technologies have\nexamined use of CPR among hospitalised patients.  Although gender has not been a focus of these\nstudies, many have noted gender differences in attitudes. For example, a UK study of 134 patients\nfrom geriatric assessment wards (average age 81), found 42% wanted resuscitation for\nthemselves, with substantially more men in favour than women (67% versus 24%) (Gunasekara et\nal.1986).  Larger US studies have also noted this gender difference.  The SUPPORT (Study to\nUnderstand Prognosis and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments) Project\ninterviewed 1,650 patients (mean age 62) from 5 geographically diverse acute-care medical\ncentres, finding that more women than men (34% and 23% respectively) did not want\nresuscitation (Phillips et al.1996).  Other US studies of hospitalised patients report that men were\nmore likely to desire cardiopulmonary resuscitation than women (Lo et al.1985, Schonwetter et\nal.1994), although this gender difference did not reach statistical significance in Malloy et al.\n(1992). Related research on desire to live longer towards the end of life has also found gender\ndifferences. Relatives, of 3936 people who had died in the previous year, reported that 28% of the\nwomen who had died, compared to 19.5% of the men, had said they wanted to die sooner, and\nsignificantly more women were said to have wanted euthanasia (Seale and Addington-Hall 1995).\nBecause of the difficulties of discussing life prolonging medical technologies once patients are\nhospitalised, it may be preferable to gauge the attitudes of older people living in the community.\nFewer studies have examined attitudes of healthy older people towards use of life-sustaining\nmedical technologies.  Carmel\u2019s (1999) study on attitudes of an Israeli sample of 987 people aged\n70+ to hypothetical scenarios regarding three life-sustaining technologies, found higher levels of\nsupport for CPR, followed by mechanical ventilation and lowest support for artificial tube\nfeeding. Women were less likely to want treatments to prolong life when asked about these\nhypothetical illness conditions (Carmel 2001). Ditto et al. (2003) asked a US sample of 322 older\nadults about their preferences for life-sustaining treatments related to nine hypothetical scenarios\nrepresenting various degrees of severity of condition and prognosis, finding that men wanted\nsignificantly more treatment than women in seven of the nine scenarios (with a non-significant\ngender difference in the remaining two scenarios).  They conclude that \u2018This gender difference in\ndesire for life-sustaining treatment was a consistent trend found in the present study and replicates\npast research\u2019 (Ditto et al. 2003: 613-4).  However, they do not consider the reasons or\nimplications of the gender difference. Seymour et al. (2004: 58) also comment that these\nconsistent gender differences \u2018are poorly understood\u2019.\nAttitudinal research about end-of-life care and preferences for life-sustaining interventions is\nprimarily psychological, with little attempt to address sociological issues or what underlies these\nfindings of gender difference, in terms of gender roles and relationships and \u2018doing gender\u2019 (West\nand Zimmerman 1987).  It is important to recognise that gender is not something that is ascribed\nto a person, but is continually produced and negotiated through actions and interactions and may\nbe implicated in such a fundamental issue as an older person\u2019s attitudes towards treatment at the\nend of their own life.\nResearch on end-of-life decision-making primarily casts patients as autonomous individual\ndecision-makers. However, women and men may draw on different aspects of their identities, life\nexperiences and knowledge base when considering the complexity of issues associated with\nattitudes about end-of-life care.\nThis paper illustrates the ways in which one social factor, gender, influences cultural\nunderstandings of using life-prolonging technologies, focusing particularly on older individual\u2019s\nattitudes about the desirability of using such technologies for themselves at their end of life.\nFollowing an outline of the methods employed in this study, gender differences in older people\u2019s\nattitudes towards use of life-prolonging medical technologies are examined. We then provide an\nindepth analysis of the discourses of older men and women about use of medical technologies to\nextend end of life in order to foreground the cultural meanings underlying observed gender\ndifferences.\nMethods\nThe paper analyses data collected as part of a larger UK study on the attitudes and values of\nhealthy older people and their confidants regarding the use of life-sustaining medical technologies\n(Vandrevala et al. 2006, Garnett et al. 2008). Older men and women living in the community in\nsouth-east England were recruited from four general practices with socio-economically diverse\npopulations. General practitioners were asked to send letters to equal numbers of male and female\npatients aged 65-69, 70-74, 75-79 and 80 and over, in order to recruit approximately equal\nnumbers of men and women in these four age groups. A total of 312 letters were\nsent out by general practices. Each of the four general practices made a random\nselection from their patient database to select 72 patients (9 male and 9 female in each of the four\nage groups). An additional 24 letters (3 in each age-sex group) were sent out by the practice in the\nleast affluent area in order to increase the representation of less advantaged older people.\nThe letters invited participation in a study seeking patients\u2019 views on health care issues for older people, asking them\nto reply by returning a pro forma with their contact details if they were interested.  Older people expressing an\ninterest in the study were telephoned. The research was described as investigating older people\u2019s\nviews about the challenges of growing old and their views about health care,\nincluding their thoughts and preferences about life-prolonging\nmedical technologies and how they wished to be involved in their\nmedical decision-making in the later stages of life. The eligibility\ncriteria were: ability to read and comprehend English, live in the community, and not suffer from\ndementia, any cognitive disability or depression. Some older people who volunteered\nwere not interviewed because they did not fulfil these\neligibility criteria, others had died or moved away.  In\naddition, some willing participants were not interviewed because\nsufficient numbers had been interviewed within specified age-sex\ncategories.\nInterviews were conducted with 69 people over age 65. The response rate was 30%, after excluding those who\nwere ineligible, and those who were not interviewed because an\nage-sex category was complete. The sample of older participants comprised 36\nwomen (52%) and 33 men (48%), with an age range of 65 to 93 years, and a mean age of 72.5\nyears.\nEthical approval for the research was granted by the South West Surrey Research Ethics\nCommittee and by the University of Surrey Advisory Committee on Ethics.  Prior to the\ninterview, the aims of the research were repeated and discussed with participants, who were\nassured of anonymity and confidentiality. Participants gave their written informed consent and it\nwas explained that they could withdraw from the interview at any time.  Audio-recorded semi-\nstructured interviews took place in the participants\u2019 homes in 2003, lasting approximately 45\nminutes. They were conducted either by the second or third author (a woman in her late 20s and a\nman in his mid 60s respectively).  The audio-recorded interviews were listened to by research\nteam members and no difference in the quality of the interviews was found between the two\ninterviewers.   Care was taken to ensure that participants were not adversely affected by the\nsensitivity of issues discussed during the interview, and a period of time was spent in more\ngeneral informal conversation after the interview, providing reassurance where appropriate.  At\nthe end of the interview, participants were given an information sheet on CPR and a list of\norganisations that could provide help, information or counselling. They were also given the option\nof a follow-up telephone call the following day, and were provided with the researcher\u2019s contact\ninformation.\nMeasures of attitudes to life-prolonging technologies\nFollowing general socio-demographic questions, the interviewer introduced the topic of life-prolonging measures by\ntelling participants that advances in medical technologies have made it possible to keep people alive for longer.\nParticipants were asked for their views or thoughts about these \u2018life prolonging medical technologies that are used to\nincrease life span at the final stages of life\u2019. The interviewer listened to the verbatim responses and recorded these\ninto four categories: \u2018opposed\u2019, \u2018accept\u2019, \u2018conflicting views\u2019 or \u2018under certain circumstances\u2019.   The audio-recordings\nwere checked to ensure that verbatim responses were coded as \u2018opposed\u2019 or \u2018accept\u2019 only when these were\nunequivocally stated by the respondent. Where respondents provided more information, or qualified their responses in\nsome way, they were coded in the other two categories.\nRespondents\u2019 attitudes were later explored in relation to 3 specific life-prolonging medical\ntechnologies: use of ventilator machines (to assist breathing), artificial (tube) feeding and\nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). They were asked to rate the acceptability of each\nprocedure on a 5 point scale ranging from 1= \u2018highly opposed\u2019 to 5= \u2018very acceptable\u2019, and to\ngive reasons for their score, which were recorded verbatim. The interview also included questions\non what values were important to them when making decisions about life prolongation, such as\nquality of life, family interests, burden on family, retaining control and independence, religious\nconviction, and dying with dignity.\nData Analysis\nAll coding during the interview was subsequently verified by listening to the audio recordings.\nResponses to open-ended questions were content analysed and coded from the tapes by the second\nand third authors, with any disagreements resolved by discussion. The audio recordings were\nlistened to and any material regarding attitudes towards life prolonging medical technologies and\nthe reasons underlying their views were transcribed verbatim.  Analysis of the qualitative\ninterview data was conducted with the assistance of NVivo. The transcripts were systematically\nanalysed to identify the reasons underlying participants responses about life-sustaining\ntechnologies. The coded data were analysed using SPSS version 11.   In the reported extracts, [\u2026]\nindicates that material has been omitted, and material in brackets ( ) has been added by the authors\nfor clarification. The extracts are referred to using an area identifier, ID number within area; and\nM or F (male or female).  Thus G14-M \u2013 refers to area G, ID14, a Male participant; and A13-F\nrefers to area A, ID13, a Female participant.\nAttitudes towards life prolonging medical technologies\nThere was a substantial and highly significant difference in the responses of older men and\nwomen (p<.001) to the initial open question: \u2018What are your thoughts about life prolonging\nmedical technologies that are used to increase life span at the final stages of life?\u2019  Three-quarters\nof older men but only a quarter of women spontaneously indicated that they accepted the use of\nlife-prolonging medical technologies (Table 1a).  Older women were much more likely to be\nunequivocally opposed. In addition, more older women than men gave conflicting views, often\ngiving nuanced answers indicating how it would depend on specific circumstances, such as the\nnature of the illness condition or likely resulting quality of life.\n--------------------------------------------\nTable 1 about here\n--------------------------------------------\nAlthough this initial question did not specifically ask respondents to link their views about life-prolonging\ntechnologies to themselves, four-fifths spontaneously made this linkage.   Older men were significantly more likely to\nvolunteer that they would want life-prolonging medical technologies for themselves (64%), compared to only a third\nof older women, p=.023 (Table 1b).\nThe majority of studies of life-prolonging medical technologies focus solely on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR);\nour study also asked about use of a ventilator to support breathing, and artificial (or tube) feeding (Table 2).  In each\ncase, responses to the 5 point scale were recoded as \u2018acceptable\u2019, \u2018opposed\u2019 or \u2018intermediate\u2019 (i.e. a score of 3).\nMore older people were in favour of CPR (51%) than use of ventilator machines (39%), with the\nlowest proportion in favour of artificial feeding (30%).  Our findings show the same rank ordering\nof degree of acceptance of these three life-sustaining technologies as Carmel (1999). There were\nconsistent gender differences across the three procedures. In each case, older men were more in\nfavour of these procedures than women, with a highly significant gender difference for CPR\n(p=.002)  and for ventilation (p=.011), but the difference was not statistically significant for\nartificial feeding (p=.23).\n--------------------------------------------\nTable 2 about here\n--------------------------------------------\nThese findings support other studies by showing consistent gender differences, with older men\nmore in favour of using life-prolonging medical technologies in the final stages of life, and older\nwomen more opposed.   We now analyse tape-recorded qualitative data to illuminate the reasons\nfor these gender differences among older people.\nReasons for Opposition to Life-Prolonging Medical Technologies\nFrom analysis of the discourse of older participants, we categorised their reasons for opposition to\nusing medical technologies at the end of life into \u2018other-oriented\u2019 reasons and \u2018self-oriented\u2019\nreasons.   Figure 1 provides a summary indication of the approximate frequency with which\ndifferent types of reasons were articulated by older women and men, with  +++ indicating a\nreason given by many respondents, ++ a reason given by some, and + a reason given by only one\nor two respondents.  Older women primarily gave \u2018other-oriented\u2019 reasons, whereas older men\nprimarily gave \u2018self-oriented\u2019 reasons for their opposition to use of medical technologies at the\nend of life.  First, we consider those older people who gave \u2018other-oriented\u2019 reasons for opposing\nlife-prolonging medical technologies.\n--------------------------------------------\nFigure 1 about here\n--------------------------------------------\nOther-oriented reasons\nThe majority of older women were opposed to use of medical technologies at the end-of-life, with\nmost articulating \u2018other-oriented\u2019 reasons. Their opposition centred around the perceived burden\non others of caring for them if they were severely incapacitated, as well as a profound sense of\nguilt at the thought of ever becoming a burden for their relatives.\nI wouldn\u2019t want that (to be a burden).... would prefer to live in a home and hopefully they\n(her children) would come and visit me....  I would hate, loathe, the idea... \u201cWhat to do\nwith mother syndrome?\u201d (F6-F)\nI am conscious that my mother thinks that she is a burden... not because of her being a\ndemanding person, but because of the needs that we have to meet....  The thought of being\na burden terrifies me\u2026  (F20-F)\nSometimes yes, I think he (husband) gets a bit fed up with having to take me to the\ndoctors. I feel a bit uncomfortable about it really. He swears under his breath... No, he\ndoesn\u2019t say anything, I just hear him mutter. I\u2019ve had it for so many years\u2026.  But I do feel\nguilty\u2026  (A21-F)  \nIf I couldn\u2019t cope with myself and I was taken into hospital and that sort of thing, then I\u2019d\nrather go (die), I\u2019d\u2026  I never want to be a burden or anything, let\u2019s put it that way.\nQu:   So, your attitude is\u2026.\nLet me go if they know it\u2019s time\u2026 I\u2019d prefer that\u2026   No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to live any\nlonger than I think I ought to  (A4-F)\nOlder men rarely spontaneously volunteered concerns about not wanting to be a burden.   Later in\nthe interview, when specifically asked if they had concerns about \u2018being a burden\u2019, older women\nhad all thought about the possibility, but a number of men had not:\n \nNot thought about (being a burden), but it would be a worry and burden to them (children).  We all say we\nwould like to go quickly.   Not given (it) a lot of thought,  but I would give it some thought, if I thought that\nit would help the family.  (F13-M)\nQu:   Would you say that (the possibility of being a burden) would be important to you\nwhen considering prolonging end of life care?\nAns:    I don\u2019t think so, we\u2019ve got two children and both of them said they would look after us and not to\nworry about anything. I don\u2019t worry about that\u2026.  (A6-M)\nThe greater likelihood of older women voicing spontaneous concerns about not wanting to be a\nburden was often linked to their life course experience of caring for other family members,\nparticularly frail and older parents.\nBoth my parents lingered, and my father got Alzheimer\u2019s. I would much rather he had\njust gone.  My memories of him are in a hospice.  Another lady (who respondent looks\nafter) is confused and falling over.  This is the third time, I have been through (intensive\ncare-giving) it in the last few years, and I don\u2019t want my children to go through the same.\n(G7-F)\nIn addition, some older women had worked in nursing and care home settings, providing them\nwith detailed knowledge of the implications of living in a severely impaired or incapacitated state.\n   The small number of men who verbalised concerns about being a burden did so in terms of their\naccount of previous life course experience of caring for family members.\nThe dominant \u2018other-oriented\u2019 reason for being opposed to life-prolonging medical technologies\ntherefore revolved around the assumed implications of being a burden on others. However, a\nsmall number of older men and women stressed that there was no value in continuing to live\nunless they could assist others or contribute societally in some way.  Another life course\nexperience that may impact on an older person\u2019s views about life-prolonging medical\ntechnologies is experience of living in other cultures with different attitudes towards dying. The\nNetherlands is one of the few countries where euthanasia and physician-assisted dying is legal,\nwhich had influenced the attitudes of this older Dutch man:\nAs a Dutchman, we are more used to this matter. If there is no hope that a person can\nhave a worthwhile (life), why keep the survival machine going?  You have to have a\npurpose of life, it can be your presence, it requires an inter-relationship with people.  If\nyou would not be able to inter-relate any more with your equals or your children, or\ngrandchildren or friends, could not contribute to their situation, then what the hell are you\ndoing?  I have lived in different cultures where the attitude to death is different, and it\nmakes you think about it.   (G13-M)\nA small minority of women and men indicated they were opposed to use of life-prolonging\nmedical technologies because of financial costs of such treatments, which were considered a\nwaste of money:\nI do not agree with keeping people alive just for the sake of keeping people alive, costing\nsuch a lot, without any independent life again.  (F6-F)\nI do think, in some cases, that the technology has overtaken humanity.  It has almost\nbecome unethical in a way, a furious amount of money is wasted on people that does not\nimprove their quality of life at all.   (G4-M)\nThe perception that use of life-prolonging medical technologies would not result in full recovery\nand therefore lead to \u2018being\na burden\u2019 on others and the guilt that this would entail, was the major \u2018other-oriented\u2019 reason\narticulated for not wanting life-prolonging medical technologies, which was articulated by many\nmore older women than men.  In addition, a small number of both older men and women\nindicated they felt there was little point in living if they could not contribute to the well-being of\nothers, particularly their family members, or because of the high cost implications of life-\nsustaining care.\nSelf-oriented reasons\nBoth women and men voiced various \u2018self-oriented\u2019 reasons for why they would not want life-\nprolonging technologies, most frequently mentioning lack of dignity and the resulting poor quality\nof life. These two reasons were often inter-related in the discourse of older people, for example:\nI think these (medical technologies) are horrible.  It is artificial, and at my age (70-74\nyears), I would not consider it.   Depends what the quality of life is like after it, that is the\nimportant thing.   Nobody should be dependent on anyone else, it (diminishes) one\u2019s\ndignity, that is the important thing.   (G5-F)\nThere will come a time when you wouldn\u2019t want to, when you couldn\u2019t do things for\nyourself, when you couldn\u2019t feed yourself, or go to the toilet\u2026  It is not dignified\u2026  I\ndon\u2019t think that I would (like to) have tubes coming out of me, I don\u2019t think I want that.\n(F1-F) \nConcerns about loss of dignity through using of life-prolonging medical technologies were\nexpressed by more older women than men. Older women with close experience of the death of\nothers following use of life-prolonging medical technologies, or of intensive caring for family\nmembers, were particularly likely to verbalise such reasons.\nI am just in favour of basic procedures \u2013 a drink of water, fluid, just to keep the body\n(moist). Not extraordinary means, not ventilation. I would just like to die peacefully\u2026\nBeing a nurse, I have seen so many people, they are dying and suffering, and their life is\nprolonged unnecessarily, and it does not help the patient, and it does not help the\nfamilies.  (G20-F)\nThey (doctors) are obsessed these days in keeping people alive\u2026  I don\u2019t believe in\neuthanasia on religious grounds, but I don\u2019t believe in prolonging life if the quality of life\nis poor\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be kept wired up \u2018ever\u2019\u2026  My husband lay like a tree trunk for\nweeks on end.  What is the point of it all?   People with Alzheimer\u2019s and that\u2026   I think\nit is important that they are treated and cared for properly, but if they get pneumonia, I\nthink you should let nature take its course.   (F19-F)\nI would ask my children to stop it\u2026.  I wouldn\u2019t want anybody to resuscitate me or do\nanything about it.  I think it is terrible, it happened to my mother, and it was just awful.   I\nwouldn\u2019t try to resuscitate somebody who has Alzheimer\u2019s.  (G2-F)\nSome older men also voiced similar concerns, especially those with life course experience relating\nto care-giving, or who had been in certain types of occupations,  such as the following man who\nhad worked in agriculture.\nNo, I don\u2019t believe in it\u2026  While the person\u2019s life is good, fine, but once it has gone past\nthat, and they don\u2019t want it, I think everybody should have the right to finish their own\nlife...   Well, I was in agriculture for many years,  I think I\u2019ve always felt like that,  I\u2019ve\nalways,  I can\u2019t see, never have seen, the sense in prolonging life of people just to\u2026\nMum had to go into hospital\u2026 and you see all these old people, just no quality - just in\nchairs. (A22-M)\nA few older men and women indicated opposition to life-prolonging technologies because of\nwanting to avoid pain, being frightened of the technology or feeling that the technology was \u2018not\nnatural\u2019:\nFor myself, at this age (age 75-79), no, I don\u2019t care if I go (die) tomorrow.  Not material at my age.  I just\ndon\u2019t want pain, I am a coward\u2026  If I had a stroke and was incapacitated, I would want to go, and\nwouldn\u2019t want to prolong my life.  I flew with the RAF during the war, I am not opposed to life prolonging\nmeasures, but I have severe qualifications.   (G4-M)\n(When asked about Ventilation):   I think this may sound very silly, I\u2019d hate to think of\nsomebody putting a mask over my face and I didn\u2019t want it, that would frighten the life\nout of me\u2026  (A4-F)\nI don\u2019t think that I would want to be (artificially fed) - I don\u2019t like the thought of giving me food another\nway.  (F2-F)\nThere were also a range of other personal reasons why older people were opposed to use of life-prolonging\ntechnologies, which included the strength of their religious beliefs, that they simply felt it was the right time to die or\nthat they felt they had already had a full life and saw no point in extending their life, especially if the result was a\ndiminished quality of life.\nBoth women and men voiced \u2018self-oriented\u2019 reasons for their opposition to life-sustaining medical technologies.\nHowever, as discussed earlier, older women were over twice as likely as older men to be opposed to the use of such\ntechnologies (Tables 1 and 2).\nReasons for Acceptance of Life-Prolonging Medical Technologies\nThis section examines what underlies men\u2019s greater acceptance of life-sustaining medical\ntechnologies for themselves.   Almost all these reasons were solely \u2018self-oriented\u2019, and related to\nthe individual (Figure 1). A number of men, but few women, had an unquestioning faith in the\nsuccess of life-prolonging medical technologies:\nI would call upon anything that was proven.   I don\u2019t think that I would want to be a guinea pig, but\nnevertheless, if it was life threatening, and you had no choice, what would it matter. (G1-M)\nBecause I personally enjoy life at this particular time anyway. I just want to go on living.\n(G16-M)\nVery few older women were so overt in their desire to keep living at all costs.   Some men\nreflected on the image of successful use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in television\nprogrammes:\nOnly what I\u2019ve seen on the telly, and in most of these hospital programmes\u2026  Well, in the\ncase of having a heart attack or whatever, you\u2019d want that, to be resuscitated certainly. I\u2019ve\nknown people who have been resuscitated in various ways and it\u2019s vital, yes.  (A2-M)\nI wouldn\u2019t mind that (CPR)\u2026 it is a first aid...  you see it all in TV... the longer I am kept alive the longer my\noffspring could keep my pension...  (F4-M)\nThe frequent portrayal of CPR on television and the success rates portrayed give the impression\nthat it is a routine procedure, which has a much higher success rate than occurs in reality.\nHowever, it was men rather than women who tended to refer to the media portrayal in their\nresponses.\nBoth older men and women who were in favour of life-prolonging technologies, often qualified\nthis by raising concerns about quality of life, displaying an ambivalence and dilemma regarding\nthe ultimate quality of life after use of life-prolonging technologies (Vandrevala et al. 2006).\nYeah, I mean prolonging a reasonable quality of life, then I\u2019m in favour of that. And quite\nhonestly if all I had to do, or all (wife) had to do, was lie on a bed in a hospital, and just\nbeing kept alive, then I wouldn\u2019t want it. But that is my view now. If I was in a situation\nwhere they said \u2018Right, it\u2019s that or you die\u2019, I don\u2019t know, because when the time comes\napparently, we all want to cling onto life if we can.  (A2-M)\nThe main gender difference in the types of \u2018self-oriented\u2019 reasons for supporting use of life-\nprolonging technologies was that more men expressed an unquestioning wish to continue to live,\nand a greater faith in the success of these technologies. The latter reflected men\u2019s more limited\ndirect life course experience in relation to use of these technologies, and a more limited\nknowledge about the likelihood of satisfactory recovery following their use, particularly use of\nCPR.  Both older women and men qualified their acceptance with a concern that the resulting\nquality of life should be satisfactory. However, overall fewer older women than men expressed\nsuch \u2018self-oriented\u2019 reasons for supporting life-prolonging technologies, which explains the two-\nfold gender difference found in Tables 1 and 2.\nAttitudes of married older people\nFurther evidence of the reasons for these gender differences can be gauged from the discourse of\nmarried men and women, when asked the same questions about life- prolonging medical\ntechnologies.  In the discourse of older married women, there was often an explicit statement of\nwhat the participant would want for themselves, which diverged from what they volunteered that\nthey would want for their husbands, for example:\nI would probably try and resuscitate him (husband), but would not do it for myself.  (F17-\nF)\nMany older married women indicated that they would support the use of life-prolonging medical\ntechnologies for their husbands, and care for him whatever his level of continuing disability.\nHowever, they would not want life-prolonging medical technologies for themselves, sometimes\nexplicitly saying they would not feel it appropriate to burden their husband with their own care.\nMarried women were also more likely to put themselves in the mind of their husband and\nempathise with his wishes, than was the case for married men.\nI don\u2019t think my husband would like to be a cabbage (pause) it would be shameful.  (F13-\nF)\nIn their discourse, married men rarely contrasted their own views with those of their wives, and\nrarely said that they would prefer life-prolonging technologies for their wives but not for\nthemselves.   However, married men sometimes indicated that they were aware that their wives\nwere opposed to life-prolonging technologies, whereas they were in favour. Married men also\nverbalised that their wives were more likely to have thought in detail about these issues, and had\nstrong views about not wanting to be a burden.\nDiscussion and Conclusions\nEven when considering fundamental issues, such as whether an individual wants life-prolonging\nmedical technologies for themselves, this article has shown that older women and men \u2018perform\ngender\u2019.  Women are much less likely to want life-prolonging medical technologies for\nthemselves, particularly because of worries about being a burden on others and the guilt\nassociated with this.   This greater concern about being a burden is intrinsically linked to women\u2019s\nlife course involvement in care-giving, both informal caring for family members and friends, and\nas paid carers in nursing or care work.   Aspects of their life course, particularly their roles as\nmothers, wives and carers underpinned their responses about the use of life-sustaining medical\ntechnologies both for themselves and for significant others. Thus, women responded in terms of a\nconceptualisation of themselves in the dual roles of care-givers and care-receivers (Boneham and\nSixsmith 2006).\nOur findings chime with research by McPherson et al. (2007) who discuss the \u2018self-perceived burden\u2019 of care-\nrecipients. Their sample of 15 patients with advanced-stage cancer were concerned about the burden they were\ncreating for others, feeling responsibility for causing hardships to others, which resulted in personal distress. They\ndefine \u2018self-perceived burden\u2019 as \u2018empathetic concern engendered from the impact on others of one\u2019s illness and care\nneeds, resulting in guilt, distress, feelings of responsibility, and diminished sense of self\u2019 (p 425). However,\nMcPherson et al. do not reflect on whether \u2018self-perceived burden\u2019 is articulated to a greater extent by women than\nmen in their small sample. The prominence of the discourse of fear of being a burden as a rationale for rejecting\nlife-prolonging technologies suggests that older people themselves, especially women, has\nparallels with the alarmist discourse of population aging.\nIn our research, men were less likely to spontaneously mention any concerns about being a burden on others, and the\nfew that did so had primarily been closely involved as carers for a relative who had died or had worked in a care-\nrelated occupation.  Older men were more likely than women to be in favour of life-prolonging medical technologies\nfor themselves, employing a discourse that primarily reflected their assumptions about how these medical\ntechnologies would affect themselves, rather than giving an account of the potential effects on others.  Men had a\ngreater faith in the success of these technologies and many simply wanted to keep living \u2018whatever the costs\u2019.  Men\u2019s\nviews therefore chime more closely with the \u2018immortalist\u2019 rhetoric found within some anti-aging research\n(Settersen et al. 2008).\nOur quantitative analysis of responses about life-prolonging medical technologies showed that women were not only\nmore likely to be opposed than men, but more women gave \u2018conflicting views\u2019 or specified only \u2018under certain\ncircumstances\u2019 in response to the initial open question about life-prolonging medical technologies (Table 1).\nSimilarly, more women gave an \u2018intermediate\u2019 response regarding their attitudes towards use of CPR and ventilation\n(Table 2). Women\u2019s greater expression of \u2018conflicting views\u2019, and voicing the importance of context, reflects their\nmore extensive and nuanced knowledge about health matters in general and life-prolonging medical technologies in\nparticular, resulting in an enhanced recognition of the multiple effects of such technologies and the uncertainty of\naccurately assessing an individual\u2019s subsequent quality of life. Thus, women\u2019s more ambivalent responses indicate\nthat they were more likely to weigh up both benefits and disadvantages, reflecting the dilemmatic nature of a\nconsideration of life-prolonging technologies in relation to long-term effects on quality of life (Vandrevala et al.\n2006).\nWe suggest that these gender differences in attitudes towards life-prolonging medical technologies\nrelate to three sets of gender-linked factors. First, a person\u2019s life course experience influences the\nways in which they respond to questions about life-sustaining technologies. Extensive research on\nthe provision of informal care has shown that women are more likely to be care-givers for family\nmembers, especially intensive \u2018round-the-clock\u2019 care-giving (Arber and Ginn 1995, Maher and\nGreen 2002).  This life course experience of women forms part of the backcloth that women draw\non when considering their own decision-making about end-of-life care.   In addition, during their\nlife course women are more likely to have been paid workers in care settings, such as nurses and\ncare workers in hospitals and care homes, thus obtaining a detailed understanding of the\nimplications of using life-prolonging medical technologies. The minority of older men with life\nexperience of caring were also more likely to voice opposition to receiving life-prolonging\nmedical technologies.\nSecond, women are more knowledgeable than men about health matters (Blaxter 1990, Courtenay\n2000), more likely to be interested in and concerned about health issues, and more likely to\ndiscuss health issues with friends and family members (Davidson and Arber 2004, Calasanti\n2004).   Older women talk extensively about health matters to each other on an everyday basis,\nrelying on social networks for health expertise (Boneham and Sixsmith 2006). Women are\ntherefore more likely to be knowledgeable about life-sustaining medical technologies, including\nthe success rates of such technologies and the potential adverse effects of their use.   For example,\nuse of cardiopulmonary resuscitation at the end of life has a very low success rate; Murphy et al.\n(1989) report figures of only 4% of patients leaving hospital alive with no serious adverse effects,\nand other studies confirm low success rates (Karetzky et al. 1996; Conway et al. 2006).  Whereas,\nmen were more likely to rely on TV and film portrayals of successful (and often routine) use of\nCPR to inform their attitudes.\nFinally, women empathise to a greater extent with how receiving life-sustaining medical\ntechnologies will impact on the life of their loved ones, and display a deeper understanding and\nperception of the views and feelings of their family members regarding use of such medical\ntechnologies.  This corresponds with the extensive literature showing that women are more\nengaged in the provision of emotional labour (James 1989, Williams 2002, Hochschild 2003).\nMason (1996) argues that women are more likely to engage in \u2018sentient activity\u2019, with women\nunconsciously orienting their actions towards the needs and emotional well-being of another\nperson (especially their children or partner), rather than privileging their own needs.\nIn our research, some older married women participants reflected on the implications of using\nmedical technologies for their husband, even though the interview focused on themselves and\ntheir own wishes about life-sustaining technologies. These older women empathised with the\nwishes of their husband, considering in detail the effects of undergoing life-prolonging\ntechnologies and the implications of any residual disability on their partners\u2019 subsequent quality\nof life.  Women were more likely to voice concerns about preserving the identity of the other\nperson.  This illustrates how the performance of gender and differential life experiences pervade a\nconsideration of even these most fundamental aspects of life and death.\nThe authors acknowledge that gendered identities are not fixed and may be presented differently in varying\ncircumstances.  Our findings show some similarities in the discourse of older women and men about reasons\nunderlying their views about life-sustaining technologies, as well as gender differences. We do not wish to reify\ngender differences as if they are monolithic and immutable (Seale et al. 2006), but emphasise that gender differences\nare located within the life course of older women and men and their differential experiences, roles and identities\nwithin the family.\nThe sample of older participants was equally balanced in terms of age-sex groups, facilitating\ncomparison of gender differences.  Since the sample was recruited through general practitioner\nage-sex registers, rather than volunteers or an opportunistic sample, this potentially provides a\nmore representative sample of older people living in the community. However, a limitation is the\nlow response rate (30%), which potentially reduces sample representativeness.  The low\nrecruitment rate may suggest that many older people view the subject of death and dying as too\ndistressing to discuss, with our findings limited by our ability to only evaluate the attitudes of\nthose who were willing to participate.\nThere is increasing health policy concern to encourage end-of-life planning, which advocates that\npatients should express their views in advance about use of life-sustaining medical technologies at\nthe end-of-life (Rodriguez and Young 2006, Carr and Khodyakov 2007). However, the debate to\ndate has conceptualised patients in an individualistic way, as autonomous individual decision-\nmakers.   Our findings suggest that there are strong gendered patterns in desire for life-sustaining\ntreatments such as resuscitation, which reflect gendered norms and values, with women much\nmore likely to consider the effects of their own potential resuscitation on others, rather than on\nthemselves.  An implication of our findings, based on the views of older people themselves, is that\nlife-sustaining technological interventions may in future be attempted to a greater extent on men\nthan on women with the same severity of health condition.   It is important for health\npractitioners, as well as sociologists, to consider the implications of what may ultimately produce\na profound gender inequality at the end stages of life.\nOur research has shown that one social factor, namely gender, has a major effect on attitudes and\nthereby decision-making about use of life-prolonging technologies. Other characteristics of older\npeople may equally influence such attitudes potentially leading to fundamental social inequalities.\n Researchers interested in anti-aging should fully consider the attitudes and views of older\nindividuals about specific anti-aging technologies, and how these intersect with cultural\nunderstandings and broader social inequalities. The rhetoric of choice and individualism may\nblind researchers and policy makers to the potential social, including gender, inequalities that may\nemanate from greater development and availability of anti-aging medical technologies.  There is a\nneed to heed the voices of older people themselves, alongside those of anti-aging practitioners and\nresearchers.\nAcknowledgements\nThe research was supported by a grant from the Nuffield Foundation, UK.
