Introduction\nA large amount of research has been devoted to the study of symmetry breaking\ninstabilities leading to steady-state solutions in models for chemical and biological\npattern formation employing reaction-diffusion systems. One of the most inten-\nsively studied of such models is that of Turing [1], which consists of a pair of\nreaction-diffusion equations. In this model, instability is driven by diffusion [1\u20136,\n9]. Some 40 years after Turing\u2019s paper, his theories were confirmed by chemical ex-\nperiments [7\u20138], resulting in renewed experimental and theoretical interest across\nmany disciplines into clarifying, extending and applying this idea of pattern for-\nmation. In the past decade alone, more than 250 papers were published citing the\nR.A. Satnoianu, P.K.

Satnoianu et al.\nTuring scenario of pattern formation1. Despite this huge amount of research the\nactual mechanism is still elusive and there is no clear-cut experimental evidence in\nany biological system of the morphogenic substance as envisaged by Turing.\nThe majority of theoretical studies in reaction-diffusion theory focus on the\nanalysis of systems composed of only two species with kinetics chosen to interact\nin the way necessary for a Turing instability, that is, one chemical (the activator)\nactivates the production of the other (the inhibitor) which, in turn, inhibits the pro-\nduction of the activator. This can lead to a stable dynamic equilibrium in the absence\nof diffusion, which can, however, be destabilised in the presence of unequal diffu-\nsion. While this approach captures the essence of the Turing instability, it is often\nnot realistic since chemical and biochemical reactions usually involve more than\ntwo dynamically independent species. In a recent paper [12] the authors considered\nsystems with three interacting species. They showed that a necessary condition for\na Turing instability to take place in these systems is that they must contain an un-\nstable (or activator) subsystem, which may be composed of one or two species. For\ngeneral n-dimensional systems the full conditions for Turing instability however\nremained unresolved.\nOur main goal is to establish general conditions for the Turing instability in a\nsystem of n (n \u2265 2) reacting and diffusing chemical species. Consequently, we\nextend the concept of \u201cmorphogen\u201d to mean not necessarily a single substance but\ninstead a network of reacting species [28] whose interaction leads locally to an in-\ncrease in the concentration of one (or more) of its species. This may occur through\nindirect autocatalysis, end-product inhibition or a combination thereof [28]. In The-\norem 1 (Section 2) we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions on the kinetics\nof an n-dimensional system under which diffusion-driven instability will arise.\nThere are a number of papers that are related to the theme of diffusive instability\nin multi-component systems. An early paper [17] classifies completely the bifur-\ncation structure from uniform steady states, but its results for the n-species case\n(n \u2265 3) pertain only to weakly coupled systems, which are a particular instance of\nthe general case established here. More recently [18] a set of necessary conditions\nis given for diffusion-driven instability in a three species system, motivated by\nexamples arising in ecology. Only in some restrictive cases were the authors able\nto give sufficient conditions for the bifurcation. Their methods were not designed\nto be generalised to higher-dimensional systems.\nMore closely related to our approach is [23] where necessary conditions for\nthe kinetics matrix to be \u201cstrongly stable\u201d in the terminology of [24] are presented\n(actually, the results of [24] are reproduced). Both of these authors did not realise\nthat the conditions they derived were also sufficient for this type of stability. We\nestablish this result in Section 2 (Theorem 2). Aided by a heuristic argument [23,\np.195] it is, however, shown how the instability arises if one of the necessary con-\nditions for strong stability is broken. As these arguments were sketched without\nformal proof, we reconsider them in a more formal and complete way (Section 2,\nTheorem 3). To our knowledge, this is the first time that the Turing instability prob-\nlem for a general n-dimensional system has been fully characterised and resolved.\n1 Data from the Web of Science database.\nTuring instabilities in general systems 495\nIn short, the practical consequence of the present work is that Turing instability in\nn-species reaction networks may arise through activators, or unstable subsystems,\ninvolving up to p = n\u2212 1 species. The number of a priori possibilities of finding\nan activator in such a reaction increases rapidly with n \u2013 an issue that is of central\nimportance in Kauffman\u2019s arguments [26] regarding the spontaneous emergence\nof autocatalytic sets (and life) in large reaction networks.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we derive the three key theorems\nmentioned above. In Section 3 we present some examples to illustrate the applica-\ntions of these theorems. We show in Section 4 how one may apply these methods\nto reaction-diffusion-advection systems (the differential-flow induced instability\nproblem). The implications of the analysis are discussed in Section 5.\n2. The main results\nA coupled system of n (n \u2265 1, n integer) species (concentrations of chemicals)\nwhich interact in a nonlinear manner and diffuse may be modelled by the n equa-\ntions\n\u2202uj\n\u2202t\n= Dj\nuj + fj (u), x \u2208 R, t \u2208 [0, T ), T > 0 (2.1)\nwith the initial condition\nuj (x, 0) = uj0(x), j = 1 . . . n (2.2)\nHere R is a subset of (\u2212\u221e,\u221e) and u = (u1, u2, . . . , un) is the vector of concen-\ntrations for the interacting species at position x and time t , and fj , j = 1, . . . , n,\nrepresent the local reaction terms. The initial concentrations are non-negative and\nthe problem (2.1\u20132) is closed by imposing appropriate boundary conditions (for\nexample zero-flux across the boundaries). In the following we suppose that (2.1\u2013\n2) with boundary conditions admits a solution, u = us , which is spatially and\ntemporally uniform.\nWe wish to investigate the conditions under which the system (2.1\u20132) under-\ngoes Turing instability. The solution u = us is said to be Turing unstable if it is\nlocally stable as a solution of the kinetic system:\n\u2202uj\n\u2202t\n= fj (u), uj (0) = uj0 (for j = 1 . . . n with t > 0) (2.3)\nbut it is unstable for the full reaction-diffusion system (2.1\u20132) (i.e. with respect to\nnonhomogeneous perturbations). Let us denote by A = (aij ), 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, the\nJacobi matrix associated with (2.3) at u = us , i.e. aij = \u2202fi\u2202uj (us), 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n.\nFrom the first condition on us it follows that all the eigenvalues of A have negative\nreal parts. We now consider the Jacobi matrix associated with (2.1\u20132) at u = us ,\ni.e. C = (cij ), 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n. We have that\ncij = aij \u2212Dik2\u03b4i,j (2.4)\n496 R.A. Satnoianu et al.\nwhere \u03b4i,j is the Kronecker delta symbol and k is the wavenumber characterising\nthe small perturbation imposed upon u = us (in the Fourier series expansion), k is\na real number. Our main concern here is to study the conditions on the diffusion\ncoefficients Di , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and\/or on the kinetics matrix A for which there is at\nleast one eigenvalue for (2.4) with positive real part. Before proceeding further we\nrecall the classic Turing result [1, 5]. It states that for a system composed of two\nspecies the necessary and sufficient conditions for diffusive instability are that the\nsystem consists of a pair of activator and inhibitor species and that the diffusion\ncoefficient of the inhibitor is sufficiently greater than that of the activator.\nWe begin our analysis by considering the case n = 1. Although this is an\nextreme situation, which is more of theoretical than of practical interest, we start\nwith this case for the sake of completeness. We show that no Turing bifurcation is\npossible in this case.\nA single scalar reaction-diffusion equation takes the form:\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= \u2202\n2u\n\u2202x2\n+ f (u) (2.5)\n(here u = u1 and we have scaled D, the diffusion coefficient, to 1) and let us\ndenote by S the set {us > 0|f (us) = 0} of all uniform stable steady states of (2.5).\nTherefore for any member, us , of this set we have\nKs = f \u2032(us) < 0 (2.6)\nNow studying the stability of the elements in the set S to non-uniform perturbations\nwith a typical wavenumber k we find, in the usual way, that the eigenvalues are\ngiven by\n\u03c9 = \u2212k2 +Ks (2.7)\nFrom (2.7) it is therefore clear that Re(\u03c9) < 0 for all real k. Therefore no Turing\nbifurcation is possible and the only interesting case remaining is when n \u2265 2.\nOur next step is to give a necessary condition on the kinetics matrix A for a Tu-\nring bifurcation to be possible. This extends the result mentioned above for n = 2\nand the one given in [12] for n = 3 to the general case. To this end we introduce a\ncouple of definitions which generalize those given in [12] to arbitrary n \u2265 2. These\ndefinitions refer to the linear system associated with the matrix A.\nLet 1 \u2264 i1, i2, . . . , ip \u2264 n (1 \u2264 p \u2264 n) be distinct indices from the set\n1, 2, . . . , n. We denote by Ai1i2...ip the square submatrix obtained from A by taking\nexactly the rows and the columns of indices i1, i2, . . . , ip. By \ni1i2...ip we denote\nits determinant (a minor of order p for A). We call the full system associated with\nA the linear system\nut = Au, u(x, 0) = u0(x). (2.8)\nAny p-dimensional subsystem of (2.8) with matrix Ai1i2...ip (of order p) is called\nstable if the necessary and sufficient stability conditions set by the Routh-Hur-\nwitz criterion [13] are fulfilled. We recall these conditions as we make reference\nto them repeatedly in what follows. To this end let us denote by \u03c9i1 , \u03c9i2 , . . . , \u03c9ip\nTuring instabilities in general systems 497\nthe eigenvalues associated with the matrix Ai1i2...ip . We construct the symmetric\nfundamental sums of these values, i.e.\nai1 = \u2212\n\u2211\ni1\u2264i\u2264ip\n\u03c9i; ai2 =\n\u2211\ni1\u2264i,k\u2264ip\n\u03c9i\u03c9k; . . . ; aip = (\u22121)p\u03c9i1\u03c9i2 . . . \u03c9ip\n(2.9)\nA necessary and sufficient condition for Ai1i2...ip to be a stable matrix is that\nDik =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nai1 ai3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0\n1 ai2 ai4 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0\n0 ai1 ai3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 aik\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n> 0, for all k = 1, . . . , p (2.10)\ntogether with the condition that all the aik in (2.9) are positive. Note that this defini-\ntion implies that all the eigenvalues of the matrix Ai1i2...ip have negative real parts.\nWe call Ai1i2...ip s-stable if, for any minor \nj1j2...jq of order q(1 \u2264 q \u2264 p), we\nhave\nsgn(\nj1j2...jq ) = (\u22121)q (2.11)\nTherefore the whole system (2.8) associated with A is s-stable if each of its sub-\nsystems is stable.\nWith these definitions in place we now proceed to our first result:\nTheorem 1. If the kinetic system (2.8) of the problem (2.1\u20132) is s-stable then no\nTuring bifurcation is possible from the uniform steady state solution us for any\nn \u2265 1.\nProof. For n = 1 the result was shown above, it is well known for n = 2 [1, 4, 24]\nand was proved for n = 3 in [12, 24]. The idea for a general proof is by induction\non n. Our induction hypothesis is this: we take a system of n interacting species\nsuch that every (n \u2212 1) dimensional subsystem is s-stable. We want to show that\nthe whole system is s-stable. To this end we need to show that the matrix C defined\nby (2.4) is s-stable.\nFirst note that it is sufficient to establish this when only one of the diffusion\ncoefficients Di is non-zero (we choose it to be D1, say) as the proof for the general\ncase follows from this (see the remarks following the proof). Therefore we need\nto show that if A is s-stable then the matrix C = A \u2212 dB is s-stable too. Here\nd = D1k2 > 0 and B is the n\u00d7n matrix with all the elements equal to zero except\nin the left upper corner (element b11) which is equal to 1.\nWe start by computing the characteristic polynomial of the matrix C = (cij ),\n1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n introduced in (2.4). This can be done inductively, for any n \u2265 2, and\nthe result is of the form\npn(\u03c9) = \u03c9n + c1\u03c9n\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + cn\u22121\u03c9 + cn (2.12)\nThe coefficients in (2.12) are given by:\n498 R.A. Satnoianu et al.\nc1 = d \u2212\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\ni = d + a1 (2.13.1)\nc2 = \u2212d\nn\u2211\ni=2\n\ni +\n\u2211\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n\n\nij = \u2212d\nn\u2211\n2\n\ni + a2 (2.13.2)\n...\ncn = d(\u22121)n\u22121\n2...n + (\u22121)n\n12...n (2.13.n)\nNote that due to the hypothesis onA (see (2.11)), ci is positive for each i = 1, . . . , n.\nIndeed, this is true for each of the terms within the definition of ci , for each i =\n1, . . . , n, because\n\ni < 0, \nij > 0, . . . , sgn (\n12...n) = (\u22121)n (2.14)\nand d > 0. Thus we have in (2.12) a polynomial of degree n with all coefficients\nreal and positive. Thus we deduce that all its real roots must be negative. This does\nnot preclude it from having complex roots \u2013 a possibility that we now analyse in\ngreater detail.\nLet us remark that the coefficients in (2.13) are differentiable functions of d > 0\nwith the property that\nci(0) = ai and ci(d) > ai (2.15)\nfor all i = 1, . . . , n. Also by taking the derivative (denoted by \u2032) of each in turn\nwith respect to d we have\nc\u20321 = 1; c\u20322 = \u2212\nn\u2211\ni=2\n\ni; . . . ; c\u2032n = (\u22121)n+1\n23...(n\u22121) (2.16)\nFrom (2.14) we see that all these derivatives are positive.\nTo decide whether or not the matrix C has eigenvalues with positive real parts\n(and possibly complex eigenvalues) we adopt the following strategy. Consider C\nas being the matrix of constant coefficients of a linear n \u00d7 n system of first order\ndifferential equations\ndx\ndt\n= Cx, for x \u2208 Rn, t > 0 and x(0) = x0 (2.17)\nThe sign of the real parts of the eigenvalues of C dictates the asymptotic behaviour\nof the solutions. To quantify this behaviour we employ the method of steepest de-\nscents. Namely we consider the equation p(\u03c9(x)) = 0 with x taken to be complex.\nThe asymptotic dynamics as t \u2192\u221e may be determined by looking at the saddle\npoints, i.e. those points in the complex plane where\nd\u03c9\ndx\n= 0 (2.18)\nTuring instabilities in general systems 499\nFrom the characteristic equation we find\n\u03c9\u2032[n\u03c9n\u22121 + (n\u2212 1)c1\u03c9n\u22122 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + cn\u22121]+ c\u20321\u03c9n\u22121 + c\u20322\u03c9n\u22122 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + c\u2032n = 0\n(2.19)\nThus the saddle points satisfy a polynomial equation of degree (n \u2212 1). In other\nwords there are exactly n \u2212 1 complex values \u03c9j such that \u03c9\u2032 = 0 \u21d2 \u03c9 = \u03c9j ,\nj = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1, namely those satisfying the (n \u2212 1) degree polynomial with\ncoefficients c\u2032j , j = 1, 2, . . . , n.\nWe now further note from (2.13, 2.16) that the equation\nc\u20321\u03c9\nn\u22121 + c\u20322\u03c9n\u22122 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + c\u2032n = 0 (2.20)\ncorresponds exactly to a relation of the form (2.12) i.e. it represents the character-\nistic polynomial of the system with n\u2212 1 species which is the subsystem of A with\nmatrix A2...n. Consequently it follows from the induction hypothesis that\nRe\u03c9j < 0 (2.21)\nfor all j = 1, . . . , n\u22121. We therefore deduce that the function Re\u03c9(d) is maximal\nfor \u03c9 = \u03c9j and therefore, for all d > 0 we have\nRe\u03c9 \u2264 Re\u03c9j < 0 (2.22)\nwhere \u03c9 = \u03c9(d) is any solution of (2.12). This ends the proof by induction.\nRemark 1. The general case where all diffusion coefficients are non-zero may be\nreadily obtained by applying inductively the above proof to each coefficient in turn.\nIndeed this can be achieved by realizing that once A is s-stable then the matrix C\nis s-stable too. This may be generalised by considering each entry from the main\ndiagonal iteratively.\nRemark 2. The following observation for the case n = 2 gives more insight into\nthe relations between the spectrum of the matrices C and A.\nFor d > 0 we have C(d) = A \u2212 dB; let \u03c31(C) be the eigenvalue of C with\nmaximal real part. Similarly let \u03c31(A) be the eigenvalue of A with maximum real\npart. Several situations can arise.\nIf both A and C have complex eigenvalues then it is clear that\n2 Re(\u03c31(A)) = \u2212a1 = \n1 +\n2 \u2265 \n1 +\n2 \u2212 d = 2 Re(\u03c31(C))\nIf A has real eigenvalues and C complex eigenvalues then\n2\u03c31(A) \u2265 \u2212a1 \u2265 \u2212c1 = 2 Re(\u03c31(C))\nHowever, in general it is not true that Re(\u03c31(C)) \u2264 Re(\u03c31(A)) for all d > 0. In-\ndeed if bothA andC have real eigenvalues then 2\u03c31(A) = \u2212a1+\n\u221a\na21 \u2212 4\n12 and\n2\u03c31(C) = \u2212c1+\n\u221a\nc21 \u2212 4(\n12 \u2212 d\n2). We have that c1 > a1 and a simple calcu-\nlation shows that \u03c31(A)\u2212\u03c31(C) depends on the sign of the product e = a12a21 (the\n500 R.A. Satnoianu et al.\nsign of the elements on the cross diagonal). Namely \u03c31(A)\u2212\u03c31(C) > 0 \u21d4 e > 0.\nThis can be interpreted in a sense by saying that in the conditions of Theorem 1\nthe conclusion is \u201cmaximal\u201d. By this we mean that although the spectrum of C is\na perturbation of that of A their sets can, in general, have disjoint parts.\nRemark 3. In [24, Theorem 1, page 255] it is shown that ifA is such that the matrix\nC in (2.4) has its entire spectrum in the left-hand plane for all values of Di \u2265 0 (a\nproperty called strong stability) then A is s-stable according to our definition. Thus\nour result in Theorem 1 and the result in [24] are complementary. Combining these\ntwo, the following result (characterisation of the strong stability) can be stated:\nTheorem 2. A is strongly stable if and only if A is s-stable.\nWe now consider the coefficient cn in (2.13.n) in greater detail. We take C as\ndefined in (2.4) (i.e. all the diffusion coefficients are non-zero). Our aim is to show\nthat the condition from Theorem 1 is optimal in the sense that if A is not s-stable\nthen we can tune the diffusion coefficients so that the uniform steady state solution,\nus , undergoes a Turing bifurcation for the full problem (2.1\u20132).\nTheorem 3. If the kinetic system (2.8) of the problem (2.1\u20132) contains an unstable\nsubsystem in the above sense, then Turing bifurcation is possible from the uniform\nsteady state solution us .\nProof. Direct calculation shows (as in (2.12\u201313)) that\ncn = k2nD1D2 . . . Dn \u2212 k2n\u22122\n\u2211\n{i1,...,ip}=\n{1,...,n}\u2212{i}\n\niDi1Di2 . . . Dip +\n+ k2n\u22124\n\u2211\n{i1,...,ip}=\n{1,...,n}\u2212{i,j}\ni<j\n\nijDi1 . . . Dip \u2212 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + (\u22121)n\n12...n (2.23)\nFrom the hypothesis we deduce that there are distinct indices 1 \u2264 i1, i2, . . . , ip \u2264 n\n(1 \u2264 p \u2264 n) taken from the set 1, 2, . . . , n such that the corresponding subsystem\nis unstable. We also note that p < n because the kinetics matrix A is stable by\nhypothesis. We show that in this case we can choose the diffusion coefficients in\nsuch a way that the matrix C in (2.4) has a zero eigenvalue. Obviously this happens\nif cn becomes zero for suitably chosen diffusion coefficients Di , i = 1, . . . , n. To\nthis end we choose a positive, small number \u03b5 and let\nDi1 = Di2 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = Dip = \u03b5 (2.24)\nLet q = n \u2212 p and denote by j1, j2, . . . , jq the remaining indices from the set\n1, 2, . . . , n. From (2.23) we can see that if all but one of the diffusion coefficients\n(Dj1 say) are equal to \u03b5 then we have\ncn = (\u22121)n\u22121\nJDj1 + (\u22121)n\n12...n +O(\u03b5), (2.25)\nTuring instabilities in general systems 501\nwhere J = {1, 2, . . . , n}\\{j1}. Note that we can always assume that \nJ is non-\nzero. Otherwise, we would have that all the minors of order n\u2212 1 are zero and this\nwould imply that the kinetics matrix is singular. This contradicts the hypothesis\nthat the matrix A has eigenvalues with only negative real parts. Then it is clear\nthat, independent of the sign of \nJ , we can always find a critical value \u03b4c(\u03b5) (>0)\nsuch that choosing Dj1 sufficiently close to \u03b4c(\u03b5) will make cn take both negative\nand positive values depending on whether Dj1 is less than, or equal to \u03b4c(\u03b5), or\ngreater than \u03b4c(\u03b5). Thus cn is zero exactly when Dj1 = \u03b4c(\u03b5) and therefore C has a\nzero eigenvalue. Furthermore the argument shows that at \u03b4c(\u03b5) there is a pitchfork\nbifurcation (with a zero eigenvalue) which corresponds to a Turing bifurcation for\nthe full system, and the theorem is proved.\nRemark 4. Othmer [23] hinted that a result similar to Theorem 3 can be established\nto show the existence of time-periodic patterns in a reaction-diffusion system with\nn > 2 equations in view of the necessary and sufficient conditions for a s-stable\nmatrix given by Theorem 2. However, this issue is not explored here.\nRemark 5. We have obtained a necessary (Theorem 1) and a sufficient condition\n(Theorem 3) for a steady Turing bifurcation to occur in a general n-dimensional\nreaction-diffusion system. Suppose that all the eigenvalues of the kinetics matrix\nA have negative real parts. The following nomenclature serves to distinguish the\ndifferent possible cases.\nDefinition. We define as a Turing bifurcation of the first type (I ) the case where\n\ni = aii > 0 for some i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nWe define as a Turing bifurcation of the second type (II ) the case where there\nare 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n such that \nij < 0 and the bifurcation is not of first type.\nIn general, we inductively introduce the definition of a Turing bifurcation of\ntype p (<n) as being that bifurcation associated with a kinetics matrix for which\nthere are indices 1 \u2264 i1, i2, . . . , ip < n such that sgn(\ni1i2...ip ) = (\u22121)p+1, and\nas not being associated with a Turing bifurcation of any previous type.\nIn other words, the dimension of the unstable subsystem determines the type of\nthe general Turing bifurcation. Note that for n = 2 the only Turing bifurcation that\nis possible is of the first type; it is usually simply referred to as a Turing bifurcation.\n3. Examples and illustrations\nWe now consider some examples which illustrate the applications of the above\ntheory.\n3.1. Example 1\nThis illustration shows how one can achieve, for any given dimension p, p even\ninteger, a Turing bifurcation of order p. It is an adaptation of an example from\nMeinhardt [27, p. 36] who proposed a system that achieves instability by the\ninhibition of an inhibitor. Consider the following reaction-diffusion system with\nMichaelis-Menten type kinetics:\n502 R.A. Satnoianu et al.\n\u2202a1\n\u2202t\n= 1\na2p\n\u2212 a1, \u2202a2\n\u2202t\n= a3\na1\n\u2212 a2, . . . , \u2202ap\n\u2202t\n= ap+1\nap\u22121\n\u2212 ap (A)\n\u2202ap+1\n\u2202t\n= a1 \u2212 ap+1 +Dp+1 \u2202\n2ap+1\n\u2202x2\n(B)\nwhere we have p + 1 reacting components with p \u2265 2 (our previous results\nshow that for generalised Turing instability any such example should have at least\nthree interacting species). Here Dp+1 > 0 is the constant diffusion coefficient\nof the (p + 1) reacting species ai(x, t). This system has a uniform steady state\na1 = a2 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = ap = ap+1 = 1. Suppose now that p is even and the initial\nconditions are small perturbations close to this steady state. From the equations\n(A) we see that any small local increase in the concentration of a1 will lead to a\ndecrease in the concentration of a2 which in turn will increase a3, and so on cul-\nminating with an decrease in ap which (from the first equation in (A)) will further\nincrease a1 again. Thus the subsystem (a1, a2, . . . , ap) plays effectively the role\nof an activator. If, for example, p = 2, we have that \n12 = \u22121 which, according\nto Theorem 1, shows that the kinetics matrix associated with the system (A)\u2013(B)\nis not s-stable and therefore we have a Turing bifurcation of type II. Clearly the\nabove example can be adapted to any higher, integer dimension and accordingly,\nsimilar higher Turing order instabilities can be easily obtained.\n3.2. Example 2\nTuring\u2019s original model [1] considered a coupled system of two species with linear\nreaction kinetics. This leads to physically unrealistic unbounded growth. However,\nthis can be overcome by taking into account that at the heart of every competition\npatterning process is the subtle interplay between the initial, exponential linear\ngrowth that is subsequently balanced by the nonlinear saturation to finite amplitude\nthrough reaction and diffusion [1\u20134]. It naturally follows that the simplest system\nto illustrate the results of Section 2 is a linear one but with some kind of control of\nthe synthesis rate of each species. As our results in Section 2 are general, i.e. they\nare valid for every n-dimensional reaction-diffusion system, we can use a similar\nidea here. This leads us to consider a system of three species in which we impose\npiecewise linear kinetics.\nLet u(x, t), v(x, t) and w(x, t) satisfy the reaction-diffusion system:\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= d1 \u2202\n2u\n\u2202x2\n+ b11u+ b12v + b13w + q1 \u2212 s1u (3.1)\n\u2202v\n\u2202t\n= d2 \u2202\n2v\n\u2202x2\n+ b21u+ b22v + b23w + q2 \u2212 s2v (3.2)\n\u2202w\n\u2202t\n= d3 \u2202\n2w\n\u2202x2\n+ b31u+ b32v + b33w + q3 \u2212 s3w (3.3)\nTuring instabilities in general systems 503\nwhere 0 < x < l for some fixed l. The boundary conditions are taken as being zero\nflux:\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nx=0\n= \u2202u\n\u2202x\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nx=l\n= 0 (3.4)\nwith analogous relations for the v and w species. The initial conditions are taken\nas in (2.2) in the form of some small perturbations from the uniform solution S:\nu(x, 0) = us + u0(x), |u0(x)| \u0013 |us | (3.5)\nwith similar relations for the remaining species. Here d1, d2, d3 > 0 are the dif-\nfusion coefficients and s1, s2, s3 > 0 are the decay rates of the species. Although\nfor each j = 1, 2, 3, the quantities bjj \u2212 sj can generally be of either sign, we\nhave deliberately considered the above form of equations to account explicitly for\nthe linear growth. To control the growth on the synthesis rate of each species we\nimpose:\n0 \u2264 b11u+ b12v + b13w \u2264 ul (3.6)\nwhere ul is a fixed positive number, with analogous expressions for the other two\nspecies. Thus, this model may be thought of as an extension to three species of\nthe two species model proposed recently by Kondo and Asai [14] to account for\npigmentation patterning in certain fish species. It may also be considered as a sim-\nplified version of any generic nonlinear dynamical interaction for systems such as\nthe Gierer-Meinhardt, Gray-Scott or Thomas systems [4, 16, 27].\nIt is an immediate consequence of relations (3.6), via applying a comparison\nprinciple for scalar equations for each equation in turn, that system (3.1\u20136) has\nglobal existence and uniqueness properties of the solutions (for all finite positive\ntimes). Thus we can consider the solutions to this system and we now present the\nresults of numerical simulations for this model. In all that follows we chose a com-\nputational domain of length l = 40 (by usingm = 4000 spatial grid points 0.01 unit\nlengths apart). The system is solved with an implicit finite-difference method using\nthe Crank-Nicolson algorithm [19]. The patterning process is greatly influenced by\nchoices of the bounds ul , vl ,wl and the length of the computational domain. This is\nhowever of little concern here, as we are mainly interested in the qualitative behav-\niour arising generically from such a system. Indeed it is not possible to completely\nmap out the whole parameter domain in view of the 22 parameters involved. How-\never, we performed simulations for a large set of parameter values. Here we review\nonly some generic cases, which illustrate the results of the theorems presented in\nSection 2.\nWe first explored the possibilities for Turing structures of the first type (I ).\nThree different cases were considered, corresponding to the different phase rela-\ntionships in the spatial oscillations between the stable and unstable subsystems.\nThese are presented in Figures 1 and 2. In Figure 1.1 we show the three profiles\nof the solutions at time t = 2189. It is apparent from this plot that the amplitude\nof oscillation of the \u201cunstable\u201d species (u) is much higher than the other two. This\nis a feature characteristic in all the numerical solutions we explored (see also Fig-\nure 2.1 and Figure 2.2) and it is as one would expect intuitively. Figure 1.2 presents\n504 R.A. Satnoianu et al.\nFig. 1.1. Concentration profiles for the three species taken at t = 2189 when a steady\nstructure (type (I) Turing pattern) is fully established in the domain for problem (3.1\u20135). The\nthree species oscillate \u201cin phase\u201d. Parameter values are: d1 = 0.005, d2 = 0.1, d3 = 0.1,\nb11 = 0.08, b12 = \u22120.08, b13 = \u22120.01, b21 = 0.1, b22 = 0.0, b23 = 0.0, b31 = 0.1,\nb32 = 0.0, b33 = 0.01, q1 = 0.05, q2 = \u22120.15, q3 = \u22120.25, s1 = 0.03, s2 =\n0.06, s3 = 0.02, ul = 0.5, vl = 0.5, wl = 0.5.\na space-time plot of the u-component of the solution. It displays the dynamical pro-\ncess of evolution from the initial perturbation of the steady state up to the formation\nof the spatially-periodic stationary patterns. In this case all components oscillate\n\u201cin phase\u201d.\nStandard analysis (see, for example, [4]) shows that for the case of a two-com-\nponent reaction-diffusion system in 1-D, near a primary Turing bifurcation point,\nthe spatial profiles of the components are either exactly in phase or exactly out of\nphase. For (3.1\u20136) there are essentially two cases to consider depending on whether\none or both of the remaining species oscillate in opposite phase. Two illustrations\nof these situations a re shown in Figures 2.1 and 2.2. A general feature of all \u201cout\nof phase\u201d cases was that the parameter domain in which they occur is considerably\nsmaller than the corresponding domain for the \u201cin phase\u201d oscillations. In practice\nthis means that such structures are less likely to occur. Note also the u, v patterns\nformed in Figure 2.1 and the high amplitude of the u-oscillations in Figure 2.2.\nFigure 2.3 gives a surface plot of the concentration u, which shows the spatio-tem-\nporal evolution from the initial conditions to a steady structure for parameter values\nsimilar to those in Figures 1.1.\nWe next studied the formation of Turing patterns of the second type (II ). A\ntypical situation is displayed in Figures 3.1 and 3.2. Here the three concentrations\noscillate in phase. Note that although they all have amplitudes of similar magnitude,\nthe pair of \u201cunstable\u201d components has somewhat higher amplitude of oscillation\nthan the remaining inhibitor species. The v-species has the highest amplitude since\nTuring instabilities in general systems 505\nFig. 1.2. Grey scale contour space-time plot of the u solution in Figure 1.1 showing the evo-\nlution from some small initial perturbation to a steady type (I) Turing structure for problem\n(3.1\u20135). Parameter values are the same as in Figure 1.1.\nit has the smallest diffusion coefficient. In Figure 3.2 we show a contour plot of the\nu-species for the same parameter values as in Figure 3.1. As was the case for Turing\nstructures of the first kind, there is also the possibility of out of phase solutions of\nthe second kind, but this situation is not presented here.\nWe conclude by emphasising our finding that the high amplitude of the activa-\ntor species (i.e. those composing the unstable subsystem) oscillations appears to be\ngeneric for all type p (here p = I, II) Turing patterns. In general, there are parameter\ndomains where type I and type II Turing structures overlap and where hysteresis is\nexpected to occur.\n4. Extensions of the main result\nAlthough the analysis in Section 2 was carried out for a reaction-diffusion system,\nit can provide insight to more general systems. In this regard it is instructive to\ngive an application of Theorem 1 in connection to the differential-flow instability\nproperty of a system (DIFI [10, 11, 30]). Specifically let us consider a general\nn-dimensional reaction-diffusion-convection system with the corresponding kinet-\nics matrix being s-stable. We show here that if the system is unstable to differen-\ntial-flow then the instability must be of convective type. In other words the system\nis stable in the fixed frame of reference but there is a moving frame in which any\n506 R.A. Satnoianu et al.\nFig. 2.1.

Parameter values are\nthe same as in Figure 3.1.\nlocalised perturbation grows as it is convected out of the physical domain. This was\nproved for a particular case of the Gray-Scott kinetics model with two components\nin [19].\nTo see this let us take A as above (representing the linearisation of the kinetics\nmatrix around a spatially uniform steady-state). It is clearly sufficient to establish\nthe result when only one of the species is flowing and the others are all immobilised\n(following an argument similar to the one used in proof of Theorem 1 and Remark 1\nand see also [12]). Suppose then that the first species flows at a constant rate \u03c6 > 0\nand diffuses as well. Without restriction we can scale its diffusion coefficient to 1.\nNow we shall show that the system is stable to small, spatially localised perturba-\ntions in any given stationary frame of reference. Let \u03b1 = k2+ ik \u03c6 and consider the\nmatrix of the resulting linearised system which we denote by D(k, \u03c6). The proof\nproceeds by induction, as in Theorem 1 above, and because the verification step is\nclear we shall only give the general induction step here. From a simple calculation\nwe obtain the characteristic polynomial:\nqn(\u03c9) = \u03c9n + d1\u03c9n\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + dn\u22121\u03c9 + dn (4.1)\nwhere\nd1 = \u03b1 \u2212\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\ni = \u03b1 + a1 (4.1.1)\nTuring instabilities in general systems 509\nd2 = \u2212\u03b1\nn\u2211\ni=2\n\ni +\n\u2211\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n\n\nij = \u2212\u03b1\nn\u2211\n2\n\ni + a2 (4.1.2)\n...\ndn = \u03b1(\u22121)n\u22121\n2...n + (\u22121)n\n12...n (4.1.n)\nThese coefficients are obtained in a similar manner to the coefficients of pn in\n(2.13). Now we apply again the method of steepest descents to determine the\nbehaviour of the linear solutions (as t \u2192\u221d). By computing the saddle points of\n(4.1) we arrive at the relation(\nzn\u22121 \u2212\n(\nn\u22121\u2211\ni=1\n\ni\n)\nzn\u22122 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 +\n12...n\u22121\n)\n(2k + i\u03c6) = 0 (4.2)\nwhere the eigenvalues at the saddle points are denoted by z. Now if the first factor is\nzero then clearly we have Re(z) < 0 because these eigenvalues are associated with\nthe kinetics matrix which is s-stable. If the second factor is zero then the saddle is\nlocated at\nks = \u2212 i2\u03c6 (4.3)\nBy putting this value of k back into (4.1) we arrive at a polynomial equation in z of\ndegree n exactly as (2.12\u20132.13) but with D being replaced by \u03c624 > 0. It follows\nfrom Theorem 1 that all the roots of this polynomial equation have negative real\npart. This establishes that our reaction-diffusion-convection system is absolutely\nstable and the result is proved.\nFrom this proof it appears that the result may not hold in general if the stability\nmatrix of the kinetics system is not s-stable. Indeed in [25] it is established (again\nfor the example of the Gray-Scott kinetics) that the instability may be absolute for\nspecific values of the kinetics which render the kinetics matrix non s-stable (for\nexample in the Hopf oscillatory domain).\n5. Conclusions\nWe have reconsidered Turing\u2019s theory of pattern formation [1] with the aim of\nextending it to the interaction of more than two species. We have established neces-\nsary and sufficient conditions (in terms of the kinetics matrix and the diffusion rates\nof the interacting species) which guarantee the occurrence of a Turing bifurcation\nfrom a spatially uniform steady state in a system of n reaction-diffusion equations.\nOur results show that the dimension p of the unstable subset may be in the range\n1 \u2264 p \u2264 (n \u2212 1). This implies that there are a priori (n \u2212 1)! distinct ways,\ndepending on the reaction mechanism, in which an unstable or autocatalytic subset\nmay arise. Each member of this hierarchy of (n \u2212 1)! steady Turing bifurcations\nhas further subclasses defined by the phase-relationships of the species.\n510 R.A. Satnoianu et al.\nWe showed how the above results may be applied by considering a number of\npattern generating mechanisms, ranging from the \u201cinhibitor-of-an-inhibitor\u201d pat-\nterning scheme proposed by Meinhardt [27], to a generalisation of a model recently\nproposed for pigmentation patterns on certain fish species [14, 15], to an extension\nof the recently investigated differential-flow-induced instability and flow distrib-\nuted oscillations which have been applied to chemical systems and may also have\nimportant application in biological patterning mechanisms that involve clocks, such\nas somitogenesis [29].\nWe have shown that Turing instability in n-species reaction networks may arise\nthrough activators, or unstable subsystems, involving up to p = n\u22121 species. The\nnumber of a priori possibilities of finding an activator in such a reaction increases\nrapidly with n \u2013 an issue that is of central importance in Kauffman\u2019s arguments\n[26].\nWe believe that the work presented in this paper is another step towards un-\nderstanding pattern formation in systems of reaction-diffusion equations involving\nmore than two species. Given that most realistic chemical and biochemical reac-\ntions do involve more than two species, such an analysis is crucial if one is going\nto verify models by comparing model predictions to experimental data. One of\nthe conclusions of the above work is that the patterning morphogen envisioned by\nTuring may, in effect, be a system of chemicals interacting in a specific way.\nIt is known [18] that time-varying spatio-temporal structures may arise in reac-\ntion-diffusion systems with more than two interacting species. A condition for this\ntype of structure is presented in [18] for a general three-species system. It remains\na task for future research to generalise this formally to the general n-dimension-\nal case, probably involving ideas similar to those employed here. Another open\nquestion arising from this work is its impact on patterns in two and three spatial\ndimensions, e.g. the issues of coexistence\/competition of patterns belonging to dif-\nferent types, of morphological differences and of dividing spots [20] and lamellar\nstructures [21].\nFinally we mention the analogous problem of a reaction-convection-(diffusion)\nsystem for which these results do not hold in the same way. In [12] it has been shown\nthat, at least for n = 3, the differential-flow-induced instability (DIFI) can arise in a\ngeneric system even in the absence of an unstable subsystem (activator). Although\nthis result was established only for n = 3 dimensions we believe that it is more\ngeneral (i.e. valid for any n \u2265 3). One reason for this difference might be in the\ndifferent character of the two instabilities (i.e. Turing and DIFI) the former being\nalways of absolute type whereas the latter can be either of absolute or of convec-\ntive type. In this respect we have given already an application showing that for the\ns-stable kinetics the ensuing flow-driven instability must be convective. However,\nthe general problem is under consideration at the present time. Nevertheless, it is\nsimple to show that for the case n = 2 we do require the presence of an activator\nspecies in the system in order for DIFI to take place [30].\nAcknowledgements.
