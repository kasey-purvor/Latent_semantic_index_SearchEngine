Type-II QDs, in which either the elec-\ntron or the hole is confined in the dot, are expected to reveal\nnovel phenomena with respect to type-I QDs, and may prove\nto be useful in carrier storage devices. In the GaSb\/GaAs\nsystem, it is known that the holes are strongly confined to the\ndots by the valence-band ~VB! offset ~the hole activation\nenergy is about 450 meV!,2 but relatively little is known\nabout the electrons in these structures. In optical experi-\nments, such as those studying the blueshift of the photolumi-\nnescence ~PL! with increasing laser excitation,3,4 it is quite\nreasonably assumed that since the electron and hole are spa-\ntially separated the exciton binding energy is low, and that\nintrinsic electron localization is negligible. In this letter, we\nreport magnetophotoluminescence measurements of self-\nassembled GaSb QDs in a GaAs matrix. Our data show that\nat low incident laser power, the QD excitons are more\nweakly bound than the wetting layer ~WL! excitons. How-\never, at high laser power, the QD binding energy increases\nsuch that it becomes larger than the WL exciton binding\nenergy. We attribute this effect to the increased Coulomb\npotential of dots that are multiply charged with holes as a\nresult of optical pumping.3\u20135\nThe samples were grown by low-pressure metalorganic\nchemical vapor deposition on semi-insulating GaAs ~001!\nsubstrates. The growth procedure is similar to that described\nin Ref. 6. After the growth of a 300-nm\nGaAs\/Al0.7Ga0.3As\/GaAs buffer layer, about 3 monolayers of\nGaSb were deposited, leading to the formation of self-\nassembled QDs. An interruption of 2 s preceded the growth\nof 30 nm of GaAs, 20 nm of Al0.7Ga0.3As, and then 10 nm of\nGaAs to cap the structure. PL experiments were performed at\n4.2 K in a He bath cryostat placed in the bore of a pulsed-\nfield magnet. The field was applied perpendicular to the\nplane of the sample, which was excited with the 532-nm line\nof a solid-state laser or the 514.5-nm line of an Ar1 laser via\na 200-mm-core optical fiber. The incident laser power density\nP was varied between 0.01 and 100 W cm22.7 Six other fi-\na!Electronic mail: manus.hayne@fys.kuleuven.ac.be4350003-6951\/2003\/82(24)\/4355\/3\/$20.00\nDownloaded 03 Apr 2008 to 194.80.32.9. Redistribution subject to bers were used to collect the PL and transmit it to a 0.25-m\nspectrometer with a 300-grooves\/mm grating. Photon inte-\ngration was performed by an InGaAs diode array with count\ntimes varying between 0.5 and 3.8 ms in field, and up to 3 s\nat zero field. The field resolution for data taken during the\n25-ms field pulse was at worst 65%, and typically much\nbetter.\nFigure 1 shows a typical zero-field spectrum for the\nGaSb\/GaAs QD sample taken at P530 W cm22. It is domi-\nnated by the WL peak at about 1.38 eV. A small group of\npeaks centered around 1.5 eV arise from the GaAs matrix,\nwhile the QD PL is seen as a low-intensity line at 1.15 eV\nwith a width of about 80 meV. The inset to Fig. 1 shows the\ndependence of the WL luminescence peak energy on mag-\nnetic field at the same laser power density, which we now\ndiscuss. It should be noted that we have verified that the field\ndependence of the WL PL is the same at low power\n(0.5 W cm22) as it is at high laser power (30 W cm22).

The field at which the transition between the two re-\ngimes occurs is reached when the magnetic length is 1\/A2\ntimes the exciton Bohr radius aB , while the high-field slope\ngives the reduced exciton mass m. Fitting the data8 reveals\nthat these parameters are 9.5 nm and 0.081m0 , respectively,\nwhere m0 is the free-electron mass. In both GaSb and GaAs,\nthe electron effective mass, me , is about 10 times smaller\nthan the hole effective mass; therefore, in either material the\nelectron will, to a good approximation, determine the exciton\neffective mass and effective Bohr radius. Since GaSb has a\nlarge dielectric constant \u00ab ~15.7! and small me (0.039m0),9\nthe donor effective Bohr radius is relatively large at 21 nm,\nand is twice that of GaAs. The Bohr radius we measure is\nthus comparable to that of an electron in GaAs, and the mass\nis also closer to that of an electron in GaAs than in GaSb (me\nin GaAs is 0.067m0).9 In the hydrogen model of the exciton,\nthe Bohr radius aB5aB\n0 \u00ab\/(m\/m0), where aB0 50.529 \u00c5 is the\nBohr radius of the hydrogen atom. Substituting in our experi-\nmental values for aB and m, we find that \u00ab514.5, which is\nexactly the value given by the average of \u00ab for GaSb and\nGaAs, and therefore indicates that such a model is reason-\nable.\nWe now turn to the QDs. Figure 2~a! shows the QD PL\npeak position as a function of magnetic field at a much lower\nP of 0.5 W cm22. Using a QD density of 331010 cm22\n~Ref. 6!, a ground-state recombination time of 27 ns ~Ref. 5!,\nand assuming that all the photoexcited holes are captured by\nthe dots, we find that the average hole occupancy of the dots\nat this laser power is ;1. The magneto-PL data show a simi-\nlar form to that of the inset of Fig. 1, but the size of the\ndiamagnetic shift between zero and 50 T is reduced by a\nfactor of 2 ~14 meV instead of 31 meV!. Fitting the curve\nyields aB58.0 nm and m50.16m0 . The size of the diamag-\nnetic shift is inversely proportional to m, so the strong de-\ncrease in the size of the shift for these data compared to those\nof the WL is due to the increase in m, which is itself almost\ncertainly a result of a strain-induced enhancement of the\nelectron mass due to the deformation of the GaAs lattice by\nthe GaSb QDs.10 A larger m should also reduce the Bohr\nFIG. 2.

Specifically, in the hydrogen model of the exciton\ndescribed earlier, doubling m should halve aB , but the reduc-\ntion we see is considerably weaker. Thus, even though aB for\nthe dot exciton is smaller than for the WL exciton, the former\nis actually more extended than expected from the exciton\nmass, indicating a strong reduction in the Coulomb interac-\ntion due to the separation of the electron and the hole. We\ncan parameterize this in the approximation of the hydrogenic\nbinding energy, EB5\\\/2maB\n2\n, which shows a reduction from\n5.2 meV for the WL exciton to 3.7 meV for the QD exciton.\nIn order to understand how this additional electron\u2013hole\nseparation arises, we have calculated the form of the\nconduction-band ~CB! minimum and the VB maximum in\nthe growth direction for the GaSb\/GaAs system using eight-\nband k.p calculations that include the strain distribution.10\nFigure 3~a! shows the result for a thin dot, which, in the\nlimiting case, can be considered to describe the WL. Elec-\ntrons will be expelled from the GaSb by the large strain-\ninduced maximum in the CB, but can be bound either above\nor below the WL by the Coulomb interaction with a hole that\nis confined within the WL, forming an indirect exciton. For a\nthick dot @Fig. 3~b!# the CB offset also excludes the electrons\nfrom the GaSb, but the strain in the GaAs matrix surrounding\nthe dot varies the local band gap, warping the CB and further\nrepelling the electrons. The net effect is that the exciton\nbinding energy for the QD should be lower than for the WL,\nas we have observed.\nWe now go on to discuss the magnetic field dependence\nof the QD PL at P530 W cm22 @Fig. 2~b!#, the same laser\npower as was used for the investigation of the WL PL. Using\nthe same assumptions as at low power, but a recombination\ntime of 5 ns to account for the charging of the dots at high\npower,5 we estimate the hole occupancy to be 13. It is im-\nmediately observed that at zero-field, the QD PL peak posi-\ntion in Fig. 2~b! is 28 meV higher in energy than for Fig.\n2~a!; a result of the widely reported laser-induced PL blue-\nshift ~inset of Fig. 2! in type-II dots.3,4,11,12 At this laser\npower, the diamagnetic shift between zero and 50 T is re-\nduced to 10 meV. Indeed, the lateral confinement is now so\nstrong that the data can be described by a parabolic field\nFIG. 3.

Fitting the data with a\nparabolic and linear field dependence gives a curve indistin-\nguishable from the entirely parabolic one, with a transition to\nthe high-field limit at 47 T, and a m and aB of 0.16m0 and 5.3\nnm, respectively. It is worth noting that since the slope of the\ndata can only increase ~or stay the same! at higher fields,\nthese values are both upper limits. Indeed, given that any\ndecrease in these parameters is restricted by the fact that the\nratio aB\n2 \/m should remain constant, and given that m is the\nsame as at lower power, it is reasonable to assume that these\nvalues are close to the correct ones. Doing so, we find a\nbinding energy of 8.5 meV, which is more than twice as large\nthan it was at low power, and 60% larger than the WL bind-\ning energy. Since aB and m are upper limits, this is a lower\nlimit.\nWe believe that the enhanced binding energy is the result\nof the dots becoming multiply charged with holes as the laser\npower is increased. This strengthens the Coulomb interaction\nbetween each dot and a single electron, making the latter\nstrongly bound. In this model, the dot is analogous to the\nnucleus of an atom, with the electron responsible for the PL\nplaying the role of a strongly bound \u2018\u2018inner\u2019\u2019 electron. Such a\nmechanism is excluded for the WL, where the holes are free\nto drift apart. This effect is closely related to the laser-\ninduced blueshift of the QD PL shown in the inset of Fig. 2,\nand our explanation is entirely consistent with recent work\non the subject. Mu\u00a8ller-Kirsch et al.3 proposed that the laser-\ninduced blueshift is the combined result of Coulomb charg-\ning and state filling of the dots, rather than a deformation of\nthe confining potential due to charge separation, as was pre-\nviously suggested.4 This conclusion was subsequently sup-\nported by micro-PL measurements on type-II InP\/GaAs self-\nassembled QDs, which showed that the blueshift was the\nresult of the occupation of higher energy levels.12 Recent\ntime-resolved PL measurements on a sample similar to that\nstudied here showed that the PL decay after intense excita-\ntion has a fast component, corresponding to the recombina-\ntion of multi-exciton states, and a slow component, due to\nrecombination of the ground state.5 From deep-level tran-\nsient spectroscopy and capacitance measurements, we know\nthat the dots may be charged with up to 15 holes,2 while, as\nmentioned earlier, we estimate a hole occupancy of 13 at\n30 W cm22. A more detailed analysis with a rate equation\nmodel will be presented elsewhere.13Downloaded 03 Apr 2008 to 194.80.32.9. Redistribution subject to In summary, we have measured the diamagnetic shift of\nthe photoluminescence from self-assembled GaSb\/GaAs\nquantum dots in magnetic fields up to 50 T. At low laser\npower, we find that the QD excitons are more weakly bound\nthan wetting-layer excitons. We attribute this to the spatial\nseparation of electrons and holes by strain in the GaAs sur-\nrounding the dots. At high laser power, the dots become mul-\ntiply charged with holes, and the QD binding energy exceeds\nthat of the WL excitons.\nThis work was supported by the FWO-Vlaanderen, the\nFlemish GOA, and the Belgian IUAP programs, the VIS 00\/\n001 project of the KU Leuven, and the NANOMAT project\nof the EC Growth program, contract no.
