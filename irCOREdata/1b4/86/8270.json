Trial teams must engage\nwith this evolving system if they are to resource their\nresearch. The major sources of funds available in the UK\nare the public sector funding bodies such as the Medical\nResearch Council (MRC) and the Department of Health's\n(DH) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme,\ncharitable bodies and industry. In recent decades, concern\nhas been expressed that the funds which are available\nfrom the public sector funding bodies, have become\nseverely constrained [3-5]. Increasingly, formal links or\npartnerships with industry are being built into UK fund-\ning strategies to maximise additional support to encour-\nage and facilitate clinical research [6].\nEven when funds have been secured, financial issues can\nbe an ongoing concern for trialists, with problems arising\nduring the course of a trial. One example is the effect of\nthe need to comply with the recent EU Clinical Trials\nDirective; it has been argued that this places already\nstrained budgets under additional pressures [7]. Some\nresearchers have reported that these pressures have\ndirectly affected recruitment rates [8] and have in fact\nforced some trials to close [9,10].\nHow trial teams negotiate funding systems and how they\naddress financial considerations which arise in the course\nof clinical trials has not yet been described in the research\nliterature. There is in fact surprisingly little empirical work\non financial considerations at all, other than brief refer-\nences in a small number of USA-based studies [11-17].\nThese indicate the costs of conducting clinical research in\nterms of clinician hours may be considerable [11], and\nthat a lack of funded clinician time for research [12-14],\nand a lack of support staff [15-17], are both thought to\nhave a direct and negative impact upon recruitment rates\n[18]. In these few studies the financial focus largely relates\nto the accrual of patients into trials. There remains a lack\nof empirical evidence in relation to the subject of how tri-\nalists actually deal with financial considerations in their\nvarious forms and how these might shape the trials in\nwhich they are involved.\nThis paper reports data on this subject arising from a qual-\nitative study which was carried out in 2004. It was con-\nducted within the broader context of the Strategies for\nTrials Enrolment and Participation Study (STEPS), a\nmulti-method research project which examined factors\nwhich might be positively or negatively associated with\nrecruitment to RCTs [19,20]. STEPS was commissioned by\nthe National Coordinating Centre for Research Methodol-\nogy in the UK with funds from MRC and HTA. STEPS had\nthree distinct components; an epidemiological review of a\ncohort of 114 trials funded by MRC and HTA [20]; the\nqualitative study which considered four trials which\nappeared to have particularly interesting lessons for\nrecruitment [21]; single in-depth case study of a large\nmulti-centre trial to examine the feasibility of applying a\nbusiness-orientated analytical framework as a reference\nmodel in future trials [22].\nThe qualitative component of STEPS explored the views of\nUK trialists, clinicians and other professionals, all of\nwhom were associated with one of four multi-centre trials.\nTwo of the trials received funding from MRC and two\nfrom HTA. Although financial aspects of trial manage-\nment were not the primary focus of this study, it became\nclear during data collection and analysis that they were of\nparticular importance to many interviewees and were con-\nnected to a range of issues other than simply recruitment\nrates. The ways in which financial considerations were\nmanaged were often presented by the interviewees as cru-\ncial elements in the success of their trial. Finance was,\nhowever, also seen as a potentially problematic factor\nwhich could directly impact on aspects of the trial design\nTable 1: The UK funding system as of December 2006\nTypes of costs Definition (for detailed explanations see [1]).\nResearch costs These are costs needed in order to run and manage a trial and are met by bodies such as MRC and HTA. They fund the direct \ncosts of the co-ordinating and possibly the recruiting staff (if salaries are not already covered from other sources), equipment, \nand consumables, as well as indirect costs to cover institutional support.\nNHS support costs These costs are associated with delivery and assessment of interventions which occur only during the course of a trial. These \ninclude the means to deliver trial interventions to participants, the costs of hospital stays and of additional clinician time. They \nalso include clinical assessments such as scans, X-rays and physical examinations.\nTrial treatment costs These include the costs of the intervention itself, the purchase of any equipment associated with that intervention, and costs \nof continuing delivery of an intervention subsequent to the period of research. These may be sought either from industry, in \nthe form of donation of drugs, equipment or funds or from NHS through their partnership arrangement with MRC and DH \n[2], or in exceptional circumstances as a specific request to DH. This latter option is available when an intervention has \nsubstantially greater costs to the NHS than the standard care which would normally be offered. Trial teams may apply for \nexcess treatment costs to be met as a subvention by DH. The costs of placebos manufactured to match the active drugs are \nconsidered to be research costs but may be met by industry.\nTrials 2006, 7:34 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/34\nPage 3 of 18\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nand progress. The emergence of financial issues as an area\nof concern led to further consideration of this substantial\nstrand of the data. This paper therefore describes the ways\nin which the four trial teams negotiated the UK funding\nsystem, and reports the views of informants on the impact\nof financial issues on the trials in question.\nMethods\nThe research setting\nIn contrast to the approach often reported in the empirical\nliterature, where research is conducted to understand why\nrecruitment failed for a particular trial [15,23-27], the\nSTEPS team wished to learn from trials which offered pos-\nitive examples. The two funders of STEPS, MRC and HTA,\nwere therefore asked to recommend a number of the trials\nin their research portfolios which they considered to be\nsuccessful. After consultation between the funders and the\nSTEPS team, four multicentre 'exemplar trials' were\nselected which had met, or were on schedule to meet, tar-\ngets agreed with their funders. They were chosen to repre-\nsent diverse research settings, methods and clinical\nspecialties. One principal investigator (PI) declined par-\nticipation as he intended to publish details of their suc-\ncessful recruitment practices separately. Another trial from\nthe funders' lists was selected as a replacement.\nThe four trials considered here are: The Heart Protection\nStudy (HPS) [28,29]; Trial of Chemotherapy for Bowel\nCancer (Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin and Irinotecan (CPT11)\nUse and Sequencing (FOCUS) [30]; A pragmatic single-\nblind RCT and health economic evaluation of leukotriene\nreceptor antagonists in primary care at steps two and three\nof the National Asthma Guidelines (ELEVATE) [31]; and\nTrial of Outcome for Child & Adolescent Anorexia Ner-\nvosa (TOuCAN) [32]. Each trial was an ambitious project\nas, irrespective of the differences in their target sample\nsizes, each was intended to be the largest in the world for\ntheir particular population. Recruitment is now complete\nin all trials with targets exceeded for HPS and FOCUS,\nwhilst TOuCAN, and ELEVATE exceeded their targets in\nthe main elements of their samples. Broad details of these\nfour trials are presented in Table 2 and their structure, his-\ntory and progress are described in further detail elsewhere\n[19].\nEthics\nMulti-centre Research Ethics Committee approval was\ngiven for the qualitative study under \"no local researcher\"\nguidelines. The study conformed to local research govern-\nance requirements and approval was given by 12 NHS\nTrusts Research and Development departments.\nSampling and recruitment process\nDespite the fact that many different professional groups\ncontribute to running a clinical trial, there is little research\nwhich recognises the variety of roles involved. Exceptions\nare the work by May and colleagues which considers the\nevaluation of telehealth interventions from the perspec-\ntive of clinicians, technical experts, evaluators, managers,\npolicy actors and patients [33,34] and by Hamilton-\nBrown which considers the tension between research and\nclinical practice in the area of substance abuse treatment\nTable 2: The four trials\nTRIAL SPECIALTY POPULATION MANAGEMENT RECRUITMENT \nSETTING\nINTERVENTIONS DESIGN FUNDERS\nHPS\n(The Heart \nProtection Study)\nCardiovascular \nhealth promotion\nPatients at \nincreased risk of \ncoronary heart \ndisease\nClinical Trials Unit Hospital - Statins (Simvastatin)\n-Antioxidant vitamins\n- Placebo\n4 arm randomised \ntrial (2 \u00d7 2 \nfactorial)\nMRC\nBHF\nIndustry\nFOCUS\n(Trial of \nChemotherapy for \nBowel Cancer \n(Fluorouracil, \nOxaliplatin and \nIrinotecan (CPT11), \nUse and Sequencing)\nOncology Patients with \nadvanced \nmetastatic \ncolorectal cancer\nClinical Trials Unit Hospital Chemotherapeutic \nagents\n- Modified de \ngramont with \nfluorouracil\n- Irinotecan\n- Oxaliplatin\n5 arm randomised \ntrial with cross-\nover\nMRC\nIndustry\nNHS Trusts\nELEVATE\n(A pragmatic single-\nblind RCT and health \neconomic evaluation \nof leukotriene \nreceptor antagonists \nin primary care at \nsteps two and three \nof the National \nAsthma Guidelines)\nAsthma \nmanagement\nPrimary care \npatients with \nasthma requiring \nregular \npreventative \ntreatment or an \nincrease in therapy\nUniversity \nDepartment\nGeneral Practice - Leukotriene \nreceptor antagonists\n- Inhaled \ncorticosteroids\n- long-acting beta \nagonists\n3 arm randomised \ntrial (with option \nto switch \ntreatments post-\nrandomisation and \nparallel non-\nrandomised \n'naturalistic' \ncohort for patients \nrefusing \nrandomisation)\nHTA\nIndustry\nPCTs\nTOuCAN\n(Trial of Outcome \nfor Child \n&Adolescent \nAnorexia Nervosa)\nAdolescent \npsychiatry\nAdolescents (aged \n12\u201318) with \nanorexia nervosa\nHospital\/university Hospital and out-\npatient service\n- intensive inpatient \ntreatment\n- general local \noutpatient service\n- specialist outpatient \nservice\n2 severity strata \n(steps) with 2 arms \nat each step\nHTA\nTrials 2006, 7:34 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/34\nPage 4 of 18\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nfor clinicians and research staff [35]. The research samples\nwhich are available predominantly seek the views of sen-\nior doctors, largely those associated with oncology trials\n[24,36-43]. There are some studies which include nurses\nassociated with trials [15,44] and general practitioner\n(GP) recruiters [45-48]. We were unable to identify\nresearch which considered the views of trial co-ordinating\nstaff.\nFor this study a broad model of potential interviewees was\ndrawn up at the planning phase, based upon an initial\nconcept of which professional groups were likely to con-\ntribute to running the trials. The study was designed to\ninclude 32 interviews, 8 per trial, split between central co-\nordinating staff and staff from recruiting clinical centres.\nThe intended interviewees were PIs, trial managers, local\nlead consultants in the recruiting centres, and local\nrecruiters (doctors or nurses depending on trial proce-\ndures). The aim of representing this range of responsibili-\nties was not to characterise the views of particular\nprofessional groups, but to draw upon and explore differ-\nent experiences of the four trials. By allowing these key\nplayers to describe the history and workings of each trial,\nmultiple perspectives could be used to generate a compos-\nite and nuanced account of how the trials developed and\nwere run.\nAs understanding of the processes involved in each trial\nincreased, a flexible and responsive approach to recruit-\nment was adopted. The list of interviewees was adapted\nand expanded accordingly to fit the unique circumstances\nof each trial. The first interviewees were recruited through\npurposive selection methods. The funders, MRC and HTA,\nintroduced the study team to the PIs, who in turn facili-\ntated access to the central trial teams and some recruiting\ncentre staff. The central teams made contact with a range\nof collaborators via their own mailing lists. Those inter-\nested in taking part in the research were invited to respond\ndirectly to the STEPS researchers to preserve confidential-\nity. Once interviews were underway recruitment proce-\ndures drew upon elements of snowball sampling as\ninterviewees suggested the importance of approaching\nparticular colleagues with specific roles in a trial. In a\nsmall number of cases the researcher made an unmedi-\nated direct approach to individuals who were detailed in\nthe trial literature who seemed to be potentially important\nto the study. Given the combination of direct and medi-\nated approaches to some individuals, an opt-in volunteer\nsystem for others, and the fact that it is not known how\nmany individuals were contacted by the trial teams, it is\nnot possible to give a response rate. This approach to\nrecruitment added 13 interviews to the study, and the\nsample comprised 45 interviews in total (Table 3).\nAt the end of the study 11 interviewees (5 PIs, 4 trial man-\nagers, 1 local lead and 1 academic staff) were contacted\nagain for validation purposes. They were asked to view an\nalmost final draft of the relevant chapter in the report to\nthe STEPS commissioners, as well as this paper, to moni-\ntor accuracy and to verify the findings. Small amendments\nto factual details were suggested and all supported the\nconclusions that were drawn.\nThe interviews\nAll interviews were carried out by telephone between\nDecember 2003 and May 2004. They were tape-recorded\nwith the consent of interviewees and fully transcribed.\nThey were semi-structured and typically took between 20\nand 80 minutes, depending upon the degree of connec-\ntion with a trial. Discussions were often wide ranging.\nThey highlighted very different levels and types of respon-\nsibilities, as well as individual attitudes to, and experi-\nences of, the trials. Because the study included\nprofessionals with a variety of roles, some questions var-\nied from interview to interview, as well as from trial to\ntrial. The lines of questioning were also modified and\ndeveloped during fieldwork, in response to the insights\ngained. To preserve confidentiality, interviewees are not\nnamed. Their trial-specific role is not given unless\nunlinked from a specific trial. They are identified by their\ninterview number preceded by the first initial of the trial\nacronym e.g. H-1.\nThis study used telephone interviews to collect qualitative\ndata. The possible advantages and disadvantages of this\nmethod have been considered by several authors [49-51].\nTelephone interviews are often used in conjunction with\nother approaches in mixed methods studies [52-54], but\nhave also been used as a single data collection method\nwith patients [55,56], and clinicians [57,58]. Sweet [59]\ndescribes this approach as \"a methodologically and eco-\nnomically valuable data collection technique in qualita-\ntive research\" (p.58). In this study the use of telephone\ninterviews permitted recruitment of a sample with a wider\ngeographic distribution (England, Scotland and Wales)\nthan would have otherwise have been possible. It allowed\nthe team to respond to the emergent need to include addi-\ntional interviewees. The topic under consideration was\namenable to discussion by telephone and there was no\nsense that the discussions or the researchers' understand-\ning of the data were limited as a result of this method.\nAnalysis\nAll interviews were conducted, read and analysed by one\nresearcher (CS), with team members (JG and DE) reading\na sample of interview transcripts, and commenting on sig-\nnificant portions of data as requested. Data analysis was\nconducted with the assistance of the qualitative package\nAtlas-ti. The analysis was shaped by the intention to pro-\nTrials 2006, 7:34 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/34\nPage 5 of 18\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nvide data for each trial which were descriptive, exploratory\nand comparative in nature and took direction from Lay-\nder's \"adaptive theory\" [60]. Layder suggests an approach\nwhereby pre-existing researcher knowledge and concepts\nare an explicit part of the analytic process. Existing models\nheld by the researchers are adapted in a process of modi-\nfication and refinement as experience and understanding\nof a phenomenon grows. The study findings were there-\nfore a product of both pre-existing perceptions of what\nwas likely to be of importance (the interview schedule)\nand the unanticipated issues which were introduced and\nmade clear through the accounts of the interviewees\nthemselves. The significance of financial considerations\nwas the most striking of the issues which emerged from\nthe interview and analytic processes.\nFinancial issues were originally considered within the\nlarger interview schedule through the practical process of\nsetting up a trial and whether or not a funded extension\nwas later required. As the interviews progressed increasing\nattention was paid to the ways in which trial teams dealt\nwith financial matters and the impact they might have on\ntheir research. For the qualitative study as a whole, which\nconsidered factors which may have contributed to success-\nful recruitment records, the analytic process identified\nfour overlapping Key Stages in the course of each trial;\nthese were \"Foundation work\" \"Recruitment\", \"Delivery\nof care\" and \"Delivery of Research\". Foundation work\nincluded engagement of scientific and clinical collabora-\ntors, establishment and communication of a trial's scien-\ntific credentials through development of appropriate\nresearch questions and methods, and attention to funding\nand financial considerations.\nFurther analysis of the interviews where financial consid-\nerations were discussed, highlighted and drew out the\nongoing and mutable nature of this element of the trials\nprocess. Twenty-three interviewees are cited here (HPS 4,\nFOCUS 7, TOuCAN 7, ELEVATE 5). Financial considera-\ntions clearly cut across all of the Key Stages. Recognition\nof the way they are interwoven throughout the course of\nthe trials led to delineation of three broad areas of finan-\ncial activity, namely:\n\u2022 Economic foundation work\n\u2022 Maintenance work\n\u2022 Resourcing completion\nThe division of different types of costs associated with\nclinical research in the UK, and our division of financial\nconsiderations into three broad areas, might suggest a\nneat, compartmentalised approach to funding. They\nimply discrete and definable costs which would be met\nthrough a clear budget at the foundation stage, before\nresearch gets underway. In fact the interviewees described\na fluid response to the funding system and reported a vari-\nety of funding-related experiences. The similarities and\ndifferences between the ways in which financial consider-\nations were experienced in each of the four trials are con-\nsidered in detail below\nTable 3: Sample structure\nFOCUS ELEVATE TOuCAN HPS TOTALS\nCENTRAL CO-ORDINATING STAFF\nPIs \u221a* \u221a*\u221a* \u221a*\u221a* \u221a* 6\nTrial managers \u221a \u221a* \u221a* \u221a*\u221a* 5\nCentral recruiters \u221a\u221a \u221a\u221a 4\nAdministrative \nsupport\n\u221a 1\nStatistician \u221a* 1\nClinical support \u221a* \u221a*\u221a \u221a 4\n4 6 7 4 21\nCLINICAL STAFF IN RECRUITING\/REFERRING CENTRES\nLocal lead \ninvestigators\n\u221a*\u221a* \u221a*\u221a\u221a \u221a*\u221a*\u221a*\u221a\u221a\u221a \u221a*\u221a 13\nRecruiting doctors \u221a\u221a 2\nRecruiting nurses \u221a\u221a*\u221a* \u221a*\u221a\u221a \u221a\u221a\u221a 9\n7 6 6 5 24\nTOTAL STAFF 11 12 13 9 45\n* CITED HERE 7 5 7 4 23\nTrials 2006, 7:34 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/34\nPage 6 of 18\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nResults\nEconomic foundation work\nFor many trials the preparatory work to develop the intel-\nlectual direction of the research, to gain the trust and sup-\nport of potential clinical collaborators, to attract the\ninterest of funders, and to address logistical considera-\ntions, starts several years before a trial actually com-\nmences. This process can involve a long run-in period of\ndiscussion with a variety of potential funders, to consider\nthe value of the proposed research, its design, and to plan\nfinancial support for costly trial interventions.\nNegotiations with industry for treatment costs\nFor two of the trials, HPS and FOCUS, the preparatory\nprocess included negotiations with representatives from\nthe pharmaceutical industry from a very early stage.\nThe funding strategy employed by the HPS team initially\nrelied exclusively on industry to fully support the costs of\nboth their pilot study and their main trial. The team\naimed to evaluate cholesterol-lowering therapy (statins)\nand antioxidant vitamins for a diverse group of patients at\nincreased risk of coronary heart disease. The very large\nquantities of active drugs, placebos and vitamins which\nwere to be used represented a considerable cost. In the\ncourse of the industry-funded pilot work the trialists real-\nised that a major shift in study design was needed in order\nto best answer the research questions and a decision was\nmade to substantially increase the sample size. The associ-\nated rise in costs caused difficulties in negotiations with\nthe intended funders, and brought about a long delay\nbetween the pilot and the main trial, as explained by a\nmember of the central trial team:\nThe gap that occurred between the pilot and the main study\nwas merely an issue of getting the funding. We had initially\nbeen thinking about a ten thousand patient study but the\nmore we got into it the more we felt that a bigger study of\ntwenty thousand patients would make more sense and we\ncouldn't persuade [the drug company] to fund that. (H-40)\nIf the trialists wished to maintain control of the research\ndesign and to increase their sample size, they had to forgo\ntheir initial funding arrangement. With such a large and\nhugely expensive trial in mind, they faced an enormous\nfinancial challenge. It was necessary to bring together a\nconsortium of funders, each to be responsible for a differ-\nent element of the trial costs. This resulted in a highly\ncomplicated seven year process in which there were sev-\neral offers and retractions of offers of funds. Another\nmember of the central trial team explained that in this\nperiod their funding situation was extremely precarious,\nwith a delicate dynamic between potential funders: \"peo-\nple wouldn't want to commit unless other people had\ncommitted and so ... very skilful negotiations had to take\nplace\" (H-42). The trial eventually cost \u00a321 million.\nResearch costs were shared by MRC and the British Heart\nFoundation. Two major pharmaceutical companies met\nthe substantial treatment costs associated with their own\nproducts. Securing and co-ordinating this level of multi-\nsourced funding was \"extremely difficult\" (H-40), and\nrequired \"a prolonged effort\" (H-39). The lag between the\npilot study and the main trial proved to be of conse-\nquence; it not only delayed publication of useful research\nfindings, it also allowed other trials of cholesterol-lower-\ning therapies to report their results during the intervention\nperiod for HPS. Some clinicians associated with HPS\naltered their treatment patterns in response and it was\nthought that this may have diluted the size of the effect of\nthe trial interventions in HPS. One interviewee explained:\nThere were some types of patients in HPS for whom their\nown doctors [decided] to use cholesterol-lowering therapy.\nThe study would have achieved a bigger LDL [low-density\nlipoprotein] cholesterol difference between the treatment\ngroups if it had been done earlier. (H-40)\nFor HPS the size of the contribution required from indus-\ntry was the trigger for renegotiation of their funding\narrangements. For the FOCUS trial, additional considera-\ntions shaped their discussion with potential funders. The\nhistory of the development of this trial was described in a\nsmall number of interviews which revealed a similarly dif-\nficult period of complex discussion and negotiation with\nindustry.\nFOCUS was designed to address the issue of how best to\ntreat patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer,\nin the light of the development of two chemotherapeutic\ndrugs, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. These drugs had been\nevaluated in previous trials but had not been directly com-\npared, nor had there been direct comparison of the same\ndrug used in first- or second-line therapy. One of the inter-\nviewees explained that they felt that an assessment of\nthese drugs by \"the independent academic sector\" was\nimportant.\"\nThere were a number of issues which we felt needed\naddressing which were, if you like, different in nature to the\ntype of questions which were being posed in the drug com-\npany trials using those compounds. And we felt that there\nwas a need ... for a large trial which had end points which\nwere relevant to patient care, looking at overall survival\nover the duration of treatment and also looking at issues for\nquality of life and toxicity when those new drugs were being\nused. (F-2)\nThe FOCUS team faced financial, logistical and political\nchallenges given the very high cost of these drugs, the\ninclusion of NHS patients, and the potential differences in\nTrials 2006, 7:34 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/34\nPage 7 of 18\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nthe academic and industry research agenda. A particular\ndifficulty lay in the fact that they planned to \"compare\ndrugs [from the two different companies] head to head,\nand drug companies are very unwilling to do that nor-\nmally\" (F-4). Furthermore, the team were trying to estab-\nlish the foundations of their research in a particularly\ndifficult system, as an interviewee explained.\n[T]he NHS was not well set up for doing research involving\nexpensive drugs unless [a] drug company came along and\nprovided those drugs. ... [T]he dilemma we had with\nFOCUS was asking questions which were independent of\nthe drug companies and weren't necessarily commercial\nquestions which the drug companies wanted [us] to ask, but\nat the same time using their drugs, which were expensive.\n(F-2)\nThe challenge they faced was \"how to obtain the drugs\nand get them into a trial which would involve a lot of\npatients in NHS hospitals around the country\" (F-4).\nThe interviewees described what one termed as \"a long\ndrawn out process of negotiation\" (F-2) with industry as\nwell as with the NHS (see below) to bring together the\nlevel of funding needed for the treatment costs. The\ndescriptions of this process made it clear that in this\nperiod of trying to reach agreements over funding, the\ncommercial agenda has the potential to influence the\ndesign of a developing trial. The interviewee quoted above\nargued that this agenda is of great importance, stating\n\"they don't want to do research which is going to put\nthem out of business\" (F-2).\nWhen you negotiate with drug companies over obtaining\ndrug supplies for trials, you usually find yourself negotiating\nwith somebody who's from the business unit or marketing\nunit of the company where, obviously, the priorities and the\nissues which they bring to bear when they're looking at trial\ndesigns and trying to make decisions about whether they're\ngoing to invest will be commercial and business decisions.\n(F-2)\nThe process by which the trial team and the drug compa-\nnies came to their agreement about funding and research\ndesign was \"fairly tortuous and painful at times\" (F-3). An\ninterviewee described how this tricky and delicate process\ncan be facilitated or inhibited by some of the less formal\nelements of the negotiations.\nWhat happens is that individual clinicians ... know individ-\nual people in drug companies, and there are sort of contacts\nmade. And sometimes ... you have very good rapport with\nthose people and they can sort of oil the wheels and make\nthings happen, and other times it's very difficult. ... We had\nsomeone who was very supportive of the trial in one of the\ndrug companies, and they really pushed it very hard with ...\nwhoever makes decisions ... but in the other drug company,\nthere was someone who ... just wasn't willing to play ball at\nall ... (F-4)\nOver a two year period in which, as for HPS, offers of\nfunds were made, modified, withdrawn and renegotiated,\nthe team had to try to \"maintain our integrity and not to\ncompromise the questions and the integrity of the trial\ndesign\" (F-2). Key informants felt that despite the difficul-\nties they faced, they had not made concessions over the\nresearch question or trial design, one commenting that \"\n[we] held our ground\" (F-4. This was not, however, with-\nout financial implications.\nWe ended up with a trial design where we had pretty much\nstuck to our guns and where the amount of drug company\nfunding was very much less than we might have [had] if we\nhad compromised the design a bit more. (F-2)\nWith hindsight it was suggested that the difficult negotia-\ntions, and the multiple offers and retraction of offers of\nfunds, had created significant and inappropriate delays to\nthe research. This led to reflection on the practice of\ninvolving industry when research questions are of impor-\ntance to the NHS but are not of direct commercial interest.\nIn retrospect it might've been better if we hadn't actually\nobtained any funding from drug companies in the first place\nfor FOCUS and we'd actually gone along to the subvention\ncommittee with a more expensive trial and said ... \"We\nwant to do this trial. We've got no support from drug com-\npanies, please provide a subvention\" and maybe they\nwould've done that. (F-2)\nSeeking research costs from public sector funding bodies\nPublic sector funders have an interest in ensuring that the\nresearch they support asks appropriate questions of\nimportance for public health and public services in a sci-\nentifically rigorous way. When they apply for funds, trial-\nists can be required to defend or modify their proposals in\norder to meet the standards set by the funding bodies.\nThe four trials considered here were all successful in their\napplications for research funds from MRC or HTA. For\nFOCUS, this stage appeared to be the least problematic\nelement of their difficult funding process. A member of\nthe central trial team commented that their research costs\nwere fully met and their application to MRC \"went\nthrough without a hitch.\" (F-4).\nHPS also received funds from MRC and the importance of\nprior negotiations between the researchers and the funder\nwas discussed in one interview. The trial was designed to\ninclude, amongst other subgroups, older patients and\nTrials 2006, 7:34 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/34\nPage 8 of 18\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nthose with already low cholesterol levels, as little was\nknown about the impact of reducing cholesterol for these\ngroups. These suggestions were of concern to MRC, and\nwere also raised in their discussions with industry. MRC\nwished to impose a lower upper age limit, and a higher\nlowest cholesterol level on the eligibility criteria, largely\nfrom concern that there were no precedents for lowering\ncholesterol for these groups. The researchers and MRC\ncame to an agreement:\n[O]ur protocol initially had no upper age limit and no\nlower cholesterol level and .. particularly MRC said they\nwould not fund us if we didn't have an upper age limit and\nwe didn't have a lower cholesterol level. [W]ith respect to\nthe lower cholesterol level we managed to get agreement\nthat it be at a level that would actually exclude no one or\nalmost no one... [For age limit] we could shift the upper age\nlimit up if the Data Monitoring Committee on reviewing ...\nthe first thousand patients or so... did not observe any obvi-\nous problems and so ... we then shifted it up but .. it was\ndifficult at that stage to include very much older patients.\n(H-40)\nIn comparison to the lengthy developmental processes for\nFOCUS and HPS, ELEVATE and TOuCAN were designed\nin response to HTA calls for applications to address very\ntightly defined research questions. For ELEVATE, the call\nwas fortuitous as some of the senior trialists were already\nwishing to address the same issues given their own\nresearch interests. The trial that they developed compared\nthe role and cost of a class of orally administered drugs,\nleukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), to inhaled cor-\nticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta agonist (LABs) for\nprimary care patients who have asthma which requires\nregular preventative treatment or an increase in therapy.\nLTRAs have been available for some years and can be pre-\nscribed for asthma patients but LABs are more commonly\nused. LTRAs are of interest as they are in tablet form and\nmay prove to be more acceptable than drugs delivered via\ninhalers, and so may promote better disease control. They\nare however the more expensive intervention. A member\nof the ELEVATE team explained that the call to consider\nthis area was to some extent a coincidence, but it was also\na reflection of the direction that research in the area was\ntaking. It \"fitted with what we were wanting to do. ... We\nhad recognised it was a needed research area and also HTA\nhad.\" (E-15). For this application \"the bidding group ...\nfell together very easily and looked like a strong team.\" (E-\n13). The team had to work together quickly to develop\ntheir application.\nWe fought and negotiated and struggled over a protocol\nthat one, met our research agenda and two, met the\nresearch agenda of HTA, to come up with a protocol that\nwas real-life, going to give us cost-effectiveness data, [and]\nwas do-able in general practice ... And then got through to\nthe second round at which time you then spend a lot more\ntime. ... [Y]ou get a little bit of feedback. I guess the one bit\nof feedback that in retrospect was probably a problem was\nfrom HTA that they thought our costs for general practice\nwere too expensive. ... Reviewers often do not understand\nhow difficult it is to truly deliver research in primary care.\n(E-15)\nThe team altered their plan to train audit assistants from\ngeneral practice to assist with the trial, and replaced this\nwith a cheaper option to employ a research assistant,\ndespite feeling that they had suggested realistic costs. This\ncost-based decision had later ramifications for the recruit-\nment process (see below). An interviewee who had sup-\nported the initial approach to recruitment commented\nthat in retrospect he felt they possibly \"should have stuck\nmore firmly to [our] guns knowing what I do now. But we\ndid that and ... we submitted a full protocol ... and got\naccepted.\" (E-15). The team then experienced a delay\nrelated to a general HTA funding issue in which the future\nof ELEVATE was unclear; they felt that HTA was going to\n\"pull the funding for this project\" (E-15). In the words of\nanother interviewee, the trial \"sat on the shelf for about a\nyear and a half\" (E-12) before they were told that it could\nproceed. Negotiations for the treatment and excess treat-\nment costs for ELEVATE were started after the initial\nresearch funds were awarded.\nAs for ELEVATE, the senior TOuCAN researchers had\nwished to carry out a trial in their specific area for some\ntime. They wished to assess the efficacy of approaches to\ncare for adolescents with anorexia nervosa and were keen\nto understand whether it was better to have intensive\ninpatient treatment at an earlier stage in the condition, or\nwhether this should be reserved for the more difficult,\nentrenched cases. They also wished to assess the possible\nvalue of a recently developed specialist outpatient service.\nWhilst the ELEVATE team felt that there was a degree of\ncoincidence in their own interests and those of HTA, an\ninterviewee from the TOuCAN team felt that the clinicians\nin their area had been proactive in raising the issue of the\nneed for research and that HTA, after a period of consulta-\ntion, had responded:\n[I]t comes about by clinicians and researchers ... lobbying\nor pushing ... for the need for it and eventually the message\nbeing heard by funders. (T-27)\nRCTs are not widely used in relation to the management\nand treatment of anorexia nervosa [61] and previous\nattempts to bring about a trial had been unsuccessful. The\nHTA call for proposals was not specifically for a ran-\ndomised trial, but several interviewees felt that the radical\nstep of suggesting this method was important in the suc-\nTrials 2006, 7:34 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/34\nPage 9 of 18\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ncess of their application. Cost was not mentioned as an\nelement in the funding decision for this trial.\nResearch costs relating to staffing decisions\nWithin discussion of research costs more generally, a par-\nticularly important sub-category of funding issues\nemerged. The funds awarded by MRC and HTA cover a\nrange of costs associated with running research, but the\ninterviewees predominantly focussed on those associated\nwith the employment of research staff. Whilst other costs\nsuch as institutional overheads or computing resources\nare generally fixed or reflect straightforward costing deci-\nsions, those associated with staff stem directly from prac-\ntical and strategic decisions about how individuals will be\ndeployed to manage and facilitate a trial. They relate to\nmatters of research design (e.g. number of intended par-\nticipants, number of collaborating centres), and to admin-\nistrative and recruitment strategies (location of\nrecruitment, responsibility for identification and recruit-\nment procedures). Although funders do not make their\ndecisions based purely on the total cost of a proposal, sal-\naries do add substantially to overall running costs and\ndecisions about staffing could directly affect the chance of\nfunding. Proposals which are seen as inappropriately\nexpensive, or those where costs have been trimmed to the\nextent that the research is not feasible, are both likely to\nencounter difficulties.\nEach trial team chose to staff their research and delineate\nresponsibility for the identification and recruitment of\nresearch participants in different ways. The choices made\nsuggested that two elements underpinned their\napproaches. These were, firstly, the strategic use of availa-\nble resources, and secondly, recognition of the need to\ntake account of the specific conditions of each clinical set-\nting.\nThe trial which undoubtedly placed the greatest invest-\nment in staff was HPS, a long-term trial with 69 recruiting\ncentres, each with at least one fully-funded, centrally-\ntrained, research nurse. The research nurses were not\ninvolved in the processes of identifying eligible patients.\nThey ran trial-dedicated clinics in collaborating hospitals\nto which potentially eligible patients were invited. The\nidentification and invitation process was controlled by the\ncentral administrative team. The research nurse assessed\neligibility, discussed trial enrolment and recruited trial\nparticipants. A member of the central co-ordination team\nexplained that this very specific demarcation of roles was\ncrucial to keep a large multi-centre trial on track and to\nkeep substantial costs under control:\nIt is a big study to keep the budget under control. We\nneeded to think of ways to keep the cost down and we felt\nthat if ... the processing of the data, the invitations, the\nappointments, all the administration was central rather\nthan peripheral then that should be another way of increas-\ning efficiency and reducing costs. (H-40)\nA clinician who acted as the local lead investigator in a\ncollaborating centre affirmed the value of the use of staff\nfunded directly by the trial in practical and political terms.\nHe was asked whether it would have been feasible to have\ncollaborated with the trial without such a post.\nOh no, no, no, absolutely not! I think for research like this\nit has to be funded separately. If it was in competition with\nour service commitment it would very quickly be sidelined\nand we wouldn't be able to do it. (H-44)\nAlthough the resources needed to employ staff to carry out\nrecruitment are legitimate research costs, they were not\nalways included within the initial request for research\nfunds. This was the case for TOuCAN which utilised a very\ndifferent staffing structure and recruitment strategy from\nHPS. The trialists were aware that recruitment for TOu-\nCAN was potentially very difficult; there was little prece-\ndent for RCTs in relation to the management of eating\ndisorders, the potential participants were widely distrib-\nuted across the caseloads of many clinicians in the region,\nand it was important to gain access to a high proportion\nof these cases. They did not, however, feel that employing\na large number of trial staff to control the process of iden-\ntifying potential participants would be helpful. TOuCAN\nwas deliberately and firmly set within existing forms of\ncare, and involved a network of consultant psychiatrists in\na highly localised regional setting in the recruitment proc-\ness. The trial was \"embedded in the [local] clinical service\"\n(T-33) and much effort was directed towards generating\nand maintaining support for the research, with \"lots of\npersuasion, lots of visits to local services\" (T-27) with an\nemphasis on \"building relationships with the consult-\nants\" (T-30). One consultant acknowledged the work that\nwas done to \"keep people like me on side\" (T-32). The\nsuccess of the first phase of recruitment rested entirely on\nthe ongoing identification of eligible patients by the col-\nlaborating clinicians as each was referred into their\ncaseload. This crucial role was unpaid and voluntary. The\nsubsequent administrative and recruitment processes\nwere controlled by a very small number of central trial\nstaff whose salaries were met via the HTA research funds\nAlthough there was little in terms of financial incentive to\ncollaborate with the trial, some collaborators felt that\nthere were potentially beneficial resource implications.\nHalf of those enrolled in TOuCAN would be randomized\naway from the care of their referring clinician, and effec-\ntively moved on to the caseload of the specialist service.\nWhilst it was said that some clinicians felt a degree of con-\ncern over losing control of these very sensitive cases, it was\nTrials 2006, 7:34 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/34\nPage 10 of 18\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nalso argued that it could be very helpful if some of these\nindividuals, who can be \"costly cases in terms of time and\nresources\" (T-38) would be passed over to receive special-\nist care, and that it can be \"a relief to get a difficult case off\nyour mind\" (T-35).\nThe system of relying on the goodwill and interest of the\ncollaborating clinicians for referral worked well, and the\ntrial accessed the majority of the target cases. This\nappeared to be precisely because it was so closely backed\nonto existing professional and clinical systems of referral\nthat according to a referring clinician it \"just sort of\nblended in with what you'd usually do.\" (T-38). Another\nclinician argued however that this was due to the very par-\nticular nature of TOuCAN, and that other trials would\nrequire a different type of research support from a central\ntrial team:\n[W]hen we've been involved in trials before of things that\nare commoner, and where the burden on the service of actu-\nally referring or involving people in trials is more, ... in\nthose circumstances providing additional administrative\nresources as well as nursing resources would be a really\nimportant factor. ... [W]here we've been involved in\nresearch, it's been the admin team which is really over-\nwhelmed by extra demands.... . [For trials] in ADHD\ngenetics and depression treatments and things like that, we\nwould've needed both nursing support or, you know, some\nkind of clinical support and admin support to be able to do\nthese things easily. (T-32)\nThe decisions about how to fund the staff associated with\nthe FOCUS trial were quite different from those made for\nthe other trials. Clinical research in oncology is overseen\nand supported by the National Cancer Research Network\n(NCRN). Research is high profile and collaboration is\nroutine in most large oncology centres. Specialised\nresearch nurses are essential members of staff who work\nwith whichever trials are linked to their unit. The FOCUS\nTrial was developed as part of a rolling programme of\nresearch and drew on the support of an existing network\nof committed collaborators. This determined both the\nstaffing structure for the trial and the associated financial\ncosts.\nProcedures for identification and recruitment of partici-\npants were entirely under the control of experienced staff\nwhose salaries were already funded in the collaborating\ncentres. As for TOuCAN, it was usual for a consultant to\nidentify eligible patients as they presented in their clinical\ncaseload. The consultant would initially explain the trial\nto patients, usually in the context of discussion of the\nmanagement of their advancing metastatic disease. They\nwould be referred on to a research nurse who would give\nfurther details of FOCUS and arrange to see the patient\nagain. At the subsequent appointment the nurse would go\nthrough consent procedures if they wished to enrol in the\ntrial and initiate the allocated intervention. In this way the\nclinical staff worked in close collaboration with research-\nrelated staff.\nThe collaborating centres were given a contribution\ntowards the costs of their research nurses from the FOCUS\nresearch funds. This allowed for some protected time for\nFOCUS, but much of the cost associated with recruitment\nand subsequent administrative tasks were in fact absorbed\nby the centres. This was possible because they had their\nown resources and staffing systems developed specifically\nto support research collaboration. Interviewees from one\nrecruiting centre explained that resources for a research\nnurse who could work with FOCUS and other oncology\ntrials were provided through Trust R&D funding systems.\nAnother interviewee explained how their ability to collab-\norate with research had increased as a result of the ability\nto apply for their own funding for research-related staff\nfrom the NCRN. This was seen as a positive step as it per-\nmitted centres to raise their level of collaboration with tri-\nals more generally:\n[W]ith the NCRN, we've got 12 nurses now and some data\nmanagers so it actually does make it easier... There is a def-\ninite improvement. (F-6)\nMany oncology centres collaborate with industry-spon-\nsored trials and it is common for payments to be made for\neach participant recruited. An academic member of the\nFOCUS team suggested that these payments, which can be\n\"in thousands\" (F-1), are \"not at all a bad thing\" precisely\nbecause they can provide an element of stability to the\nresearch infrastructure within collaborating centres. Effec-\ntively the costs of collaboration with trials such as FOCUS\nare subsidised though existing links with industry. In\ncomparison to the payments made to recruiting centres by\nindustry trials, those from public sector trials can be far\nless lucrative. A senior research nurse explained how the\nless lucrative links can be problematic.\n[W]e find that the money we're gaining from commercially\nsponsored studies actually pays for the nurses. ... [T]he\nNRCN studies only give us something like two hundred\npounds a patient for data collection. ... It costs a lot more\nthan that, and in our institution it's usually the industry-\nsponsored studies, the money we make from that [which]\nwill pay for the nurses. ... We have a commitment to MRC\ntrials first. We would always recruit to them before an\nindustry- sponsored one because we're an academic depart-\nment. [But there are] ... issues of paying research nurses'\nwages and [if] you've got a study that pays five thousand\npounds per patient or one that pays two hundred pounds per\npatient.........! (F-10)\nTrials 2006, 7:34 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/34\nPage 11 of 18\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nAn interview with another research nurse suggested that in\ncollaborating centres, competition for staff time between\nnon-industry and industry-led trials can also be problem-\natic. The nurse argued that \"one of the main problems was\nstaffing\" (F-9). Centres can be under \"a lot of pressure\nfrom the drug companies\" (F-9) to maintain their records\nand keep on top of their trial-related administration, wary\nof the possibility of inspection of records in relation to the\nEU Directive. This pressure meant that in this centre\nefforts were diverted from the public sector trials which\ntherefore fell behind; essentially \"other priorities had\ncome into the forefront\" (F-9). A research nurse post was\ndeveloped by local staff to address an administrative trial-\nrelated backlog in their centre.\nFOCUS ... had sort of fallen by-the-by with data manage-\nment ... [T]he sheer workload was too much for the\nresearch nurses that we had. (F-9)\nWhile attempt were made to catch up with the administra-\ntive backlog for FOCUS, clinicians put recruitment of new\npatients temporarily on hold.\n[F]or a couple of months [they] just put people on the\nstandard [treatment] and didn't [recruit] because [they]\nknew that we couldn't manage the workload. (F-9)\nThis account suggested important ways in which financial\nissues, in practical and political terms, directly shaped\nrecruitment to a trial at a local, behind-the-scenes, level.\nNegotiations with service providers in relation to NHS support costs \nand excess treatment costs\nWith research costs covered by MRC or HTA, and the\ncosts, or partial costs, of drugs to be used in a trial secured\nfrom an external source, the trialists also had to consider\nhow to meet any excess costs associated with unfunded\ndrugs, and the delivery and assessment of care. As HPS\nhad agreed the funds for the trial drugs with industry, and\nremoved the delivery of the research interventions and\nsubsequent assessment from the NHS setting, there was\nno obligation to negotiate NHS support costs or excess\ntreatment costs. The interventions in TOuCAN so closely\napproximated the existing care arrangements that again\nthere was not an issue of excess costs to the NHS. By con-\ntrast the negotiations for FOCUS and ELEVATE were com-\nplicated and sensitive.\nTrials such as FOCUS which have MRC funding should, in\ntheory, be supported by an agreement with NHS Trusts,\nknown as the NHS Research Concordat [2,61]. Under the\nterms of this agreement, if MRC covers research costs,\nNHS Trusts are obliged to take responsibility for 'legiti-\nmate' service support and treatment costs associated with\na trial. It was anticipated that the Concordat would facili-\ntate collaboration with FOCUS for individual centres and\ngenerally the NHS Trusts did comply with the Concordat.\nThe Trusts were, however, \"in different states of financial\ndistress around the country\" (F-2), and the excess treat-\nment costs associated with the trial were substantial, and\nthe agreement did not provide the broad support that had\nbeen expected. It was necessary to apply to the NHS Trust\nof each potential collaborating centre, for the excess treat-\nment costs to be met. One of the clinical lead investigators\nin a collaborating centre explained how for them it had\nbeen \"straightforward\", but was not so for others.\n[In our region the Concordat is] considered to be authori-\ntative and [they] will honour their responsibilities to pro-\nvide us with excess treatment costs. ... I'm very aware of\nother centres and the problems they had [when their Trust]\nwould not fund the excess treatment costs in this trial. So a\nnumber of areas ... were not able to contribute patients,\nalthough they wanted to. (F-3)\nThe ELEVATE trialists faced a similar issue in that GP prac-\ntices which might collaborate with their trial were\naccountable to NHS Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) for any\nincrease in their prescribing budgets incurred through\ntheir association with the trial. In this setting there is no\nequivalent to the Concordat. Rather than relying on PCTs\nto, in effect, subsidise the research, the trialists entered\nnegotiations which centred on their keeping costs to the\nPCTs \"neutral\" (E-15). The trialists provided funds to the\nPCTs to offset any treatment costs and so facilitate their\ncollaboration and that of the GP practices. These offset-\nting funds were sought from industry. One interviewee\nexplained the importance of this.\nWe managed to get industry to make a ... contribution to\nthe excess treatment costs, to head off the resistance we\nthought we might encounter particularly from the [PCTs]\nholding the drug-prescribing budgets for primary care. ...\nBecause the leukotriene receptor antagonists are more\nexpensive than other therapies, it could have pushed up\ntheir prescribing costs. ... Certainly once you make a formal\napproach to GPs to participate in a study like this, one of\nthe questions that they are bound to ask is 'Is this going to\nget us into trouble with the PCT?' ... So we managed to get\na no-strings-attached contribution from the two companies\nwho manufacture leukotriene receptor antagonists, which\nwe've been able to pay into the local PCT drug budgets, on\na proportionate basis according to the number of practices\nthat were participating in the study. ... I think if we hadn't\nbeen able to get that going, we might have had whole PCTs\n[and] whole groups of practices who might have said 'No,\nwe won't participate because the excess treatments costs\naren't covered'. (E-13)\nTrials 2006, 7:34 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/34\nPage 12 of 18\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nThe practices that collaborated with the trial were also\ngiven a contribution to their funds to cover nursing time,\nsomething which was thought to be likely to promote \"a\nstronger collaboration\" (E-13). Although one GP argued\nthat this did not in fact cover the costs involved, it was still\nwidely viewed as an effective and essential strategy.\nMaintenance work\nThe bulk of the financial considerations for these trials\nundoubtedly occurred in the foundation stages described\nabove. It became apparent, however, that even when the\ntrials were funded and recruitment was underway, finan-\ncial challenges could arise at further points in the course\nof the research. This was particularly evident for two of the\ntrials, ELEVATE and FOCUS, where trialists had to\nrespond and adapt to changing financial situations in two\nparticular areas. Interviewees from these two trials\ndescribed:\n\u2022 the need to renegotiate trial finances\n\u2022 the need to weather financial storms\nThe need to renegotiate trial finances\nELEVATE encountered major difficulties in recruitment\nand this was accounted for partly by the 18 month delay\nin receiving the funds from HTA. The time-lag meant that\nthe trialists were faced with carrying out their research in\na different research climate from that which they had\nenvisaged. The trial involved recruitment of patients with\nuncontrolled asthma, who would be appropriate candi-\ndates for a change in their therapy. Interest in this group\nof patients had grown since the funds were initially\nawarded.\n[P]harma-companies were really pushing for this group of\npatients to go on to additional therapy so many of our eligi-\nble patients had been 'stolen' if you like by the pharmaceu-\ntical companies. ... I mean there was still a pool of patients\nthere but they were the slightly more difficult-to-access\npatients. (E-15)\nThis background of competition with an industry trial for\neligible patients was undoubtedly a challenge, and was\nexacerbated by difficulties encountered in the general\npractice environment. ELEVATE, like TOuCAN, aimed to\nbed the research into the clinical setting by including GP\npractices in recruitment processes. As the trial was devel-\noped by GPs, in consultation with GPs, there was sensitiv-\nity to the fact that costs which might be incurred could\nhave personal as well as institutional financial implica-\ntions for collaborators. A GP explained the nature of the\nproblem:\nGeneral practices are actually small businesses and they are\nfunded in a completely different way to hospitals. ... If you\nare a teaching hospital there may be funding in the system\nfor the idea of supporting research. In general practice\nresearch is not a core thing that is funded at all. ... Even\nthings like sending out letters, stamps on envelopes and sec-\nretarial time, all of that costs money. The only place that\nthat money will come out of is the practice profits, which is\nbasically the partners' income. So unless it is adequately\nfunded you are actually asking the individual GPs to take\nhome less money in order to do the research. That is just not\nthe case in hospitals. It doesn't affect the doctors' or nurses'\nincomes at all [if] research goes on. (E-23)\nAlthough the trial team were aware of these issues, the\ntrial still required greater human resources than were\nanticipated. It quickly became evident that recruitment\nproblems in the GP practices were, in great part due to the\ntrial-related workload which fell to the practice staff. The\ntrial team reacted swiftly, seeking additional research\nfunds from HTA in order to radically modify their admin-\nistrative procedures. The entire method of identification\nand recruitment of potential participants was refined and\nshifted towards an approach which was similar to that\nused by HPS. The renegotiated HTA funds allowed the\nworkload to be directed away from practices, removing\nthe requirement for their staff to carry out time-consum-\ning searches to identify eligible patients, through payment\nfor additional trial staff and the occasional use of inde-\npendent agency research nurses. GPs and practice nurses\nmentioned during the interviews that without this more\nintensive input, collaboration would have been difficult if\nnot impossible.\nThe most important thing in the ELEVATE Study has been\nthe support from the researchers. ... I contrast that with a\nstudy I was doing for a commercial research organisation\nwhich was overly burdensome with paperwork, very poor\nsupport from the research assistants ... and in the end we\ndidn't recruit anybody for their trial. (E-21)\nThe need to weather financial storms\nFor ELEVATE the problems with recruitment were identi-\nfied early in the course of the trial. For FOCUS, difficulties\narose in relation to debates about the evidence of clinical\neffectiveness and treatment costs which could have\nderailed the trial, two years into recruitment. In 2002 the\nNational Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) argued\nthat existing and emerging data on improvements in sur-\nvival times for irinotecan and oxaliplatin did not warrant\nthe costs associated with their routine use in first-line ther-\napy. NICE issued guidelines recommending that irinote-\ncan should be used only after failure of a first-line\ntreatment, and that the use of oxaliplatin be restricted to a\nsmall sub-category of patients [62]. The guidelines\nTrials 2006, 7:34 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/34\nPage 13 of 18\n(page number not for citation purposes)\naffected FOCUS in several ways. Firstly, except for a sub-\ngroup, oxaliplatin was now available only via the trial, to\nwhich NICE recommended recruitment. Secondly, NICE\nhad recommended second-line irinotecan when first-line\ntreatments had failed, when two of the arms in the trial\ndid not employ irinotecan. Furthermore, NHS Trusts\nwhich had not permitted their hospital departments to\nrefer to FOCUS because of the associated treatment costs,\nwere being specifically directed to make such referrals\nthrough the NICE guidance.\nThe NICE guidance caused concerns which were expressed\nin a letter to a newspaper by 28 oncologists, almost half of\nthe UK oncologists practising in this speciality. They\nargued that the restrictions placed around irinotecan and\noxaliplatin would reduce life expectancy [63]. The trial\nteam responded in this difficult period by adapting the\ntrial design to allow patients who had received oxaliplatin\nto cross over to irinotecan, and those that had received iri-\nnotecan to cross over to oxaliplatin. At this stage the phar-\nmaceutical company withdrew its support and stopped\nproviding irinotecan for FOCUS, a move which interview-\nees felt was a direct consequence of NICE's guidelines on\ntreatment costs. This appeared to be a major financial\nchallenge to the trial, with several interviewees stating that\nthey expected serious consequences, \"an absolute disas-\nter\" (F-4). In spite of these concerns, the recruitment rate\nremained steady, with the collaborators' NHS Trusts effec-\ntively absorbing the treatment costs for patients who were\nreferred to the trial.\nInformation gleaned from interviewees from the collabo-\nrating centres sheds further light on possible reasons for\nthe continuing commitment to the trial. Although it was\nclear that the costs of the drugs, and the limitations\nimposed by NICE did cause concern, some stated that\nafter the NICE guidance they recruited to the trial with the\nexplicit aim of accessing the drugs. A consultant described\nhow he presented the complicated funding situation for\noncology drugs to patients who were eligible for FOCUS.\nHe described a need to balance giving honest information\nwithout applying pressure, given the already difficult situ-\nation of those with advanced metastatic cancer:\nYou don't want to force a patient to go into trial, but I do\nsay that by going into the FOCUS study, there is oxaliplatin\navailable. We don't have funding for that outside the study.\n(F-6)\nIt seemed that by this time the trial, its community and\npatterns of intervention were sufficiently established that\nthe contentious issue of treatment costs and the loss of\nindustry support, did not impact upon recruitment at all.\nCompletion work\nTowards the end of the research process the trialists had to\nengage once again with financial considerations to ensure\nthat their trials achieved their aims. All of the trials needed\nto extend their recruitment periods. Recruitment for\nFOCUS was slower than expected and took place over\nthree and half years rather than the planned three years. It\nwas, however, possible to accommodate the longer\nrecruitment period within the original funds. With a time-\nonly (i.e. no-cost) extension from MRC, FOCUS exceeded\nits target of 2100 participants by 35 cases.\nThe other three trials all required funded extensions from\nMRC or HTA. With regard to the funding extension which\nwas awarded to HPS, an interviewee explained that it was\nin fact a calculated element of the original funding strat-\negy. The request for an extension was not made in\nresponse to difficulties arising in the research process but\na deliberate budgeting plan:\nWe always knew that we would have to have a funding\nextension ... We had only applied for a five or six year grant\nso it was always anticipated that we would need an exten-\nsion. (H-39)\nThe completion work for TOuCAN and ELEVATE required\nsome reorganisation of their design, as well as the input of\nadditional funds and time. Although recruitment was very\nsuccessful for TOuCAN, it became evident during the\nrecruitment period that the target of 210 adolescents (70\nper arm) randomised into the RCT was not going to be\nmet within the original timeframe. TOuCAN included an\nadditional naturalistic arm wherein up to 70 adolescents\nwho declined to have their care randomised, but wished\nto contribute to the research, could be followed up. The\nshortfall in both the trial and the naturalistic arm was\nattributed to the fact that although the clinicians had\nreferred \"quite a lot of young people\" (T-34), the trial\nteam was notified about significantly fewer cases than\nthey had anticipated. Even with accrual of 90% of the\nreferred cases, the initial calculations needed reassess-\nment.\nWe did a revised power calculation part way through ... and\nwe found that we would still just have enough power if we\ncould get to 50 in each [of the] randomised groups. The\nrate of recruitment was that we went back to the HTA and\nsaid \"Look we, we've got this far but we're actually signifi-\ncantly off our recruitment rate. We need an extra year of\nrecruitment.\" And they gave us an extra year. (T-27)\nWith new power calculations the trial target was revised to\n55 adolescents per arm, and 75 in the naturalistic arm. A\nfunded extension was awarded by HTA. The target was\nexceeded with 167 participants recruited to the trial, with\nTrials 2006, 7:34 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/34\nPage 14 of 18\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nan additional 46 adolescents in the naturalistic arm. These\nfigures were achieved in three and a half instead of the\nintended two years.\nFurther funds were also granted by HTA in response to\nrevised costings for ELEVATE. At the time of the interviews\nthe trial team were still trying to work out their strategy for\ncompleting the trial. One interviewee described the way\nforward as \"currently under debate.\" (E-12) One of the\nstrata of the trial was proving to be particularly problem-\natic and the team were facing a decision, essentially that\nthey had to \"decide whether we're going to try to get a fur-\nther extension or whether we're going to eat into the fol-\nlow-up period\" (E-13). Another interviewee similarly\ndescribed the choices that they felt they faced.\nWe either will fail or we will revise. ... [We could] keep\nrecruiting for long enough that a slower recruiting rate gets\nus there but we then have a shorter follow-up for some peo-\nple. (E-12)\nFurther funds were requested and awarded and the trial\nexceeded the intended sample size of 356 participants for\none stratum, recruiting 361 participants, and recruited\n325 of the planned 356 participants for the second stra-\ntum. The choice to reduce the length of the follow-up\nperiod for the second stratum enabled the recruitment\nperiod for this group to be extended without another\nextension of the amount or period of the funding.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nThe aim of this analysis was to explore how a group of trial\nteams negotiated the UK funding system for clinical trials\nand how financial considerations in their various forms\nmight shape their research. The trialists and collaborators\ninterviewed for this study described difficult and sensitive\nactivities which went beyond simply making a grant\napplication and balancing the books. Their accounts high-\nlight important ways in which the funding system and\nbroader financial matters affected both the development\nand subsequent conduct of their trials. They suggest that a\nmajor challenge for the teams was often to secure the\nfinancial support that they needed, and to conduct the tri-\nals with the fewest compromises to their vision of the sci-\nentific, clinical and ethical elements of their research. Of\nparticular significance in the accounts of those who\nresource and manage clinical trials was their experience of\ndealing with a slow moving, multipart, intricate and at\ntimes apparently fragile funding system.\nAlthough there appears to be a clear demarcation of the\nthree different types of costs which need to be met\n(research, NHS support, and treatment), and delineation\nof which bodies are responsible for each, the teams in fact\ndescribed quite individual ways of utilising the system. In\npart these related to how they had chosen to design and\nstructure their trials. A trial designed to include many\npatients or expensive drugs required industry support\nrather than relying on NHS Trusts. A trial backed closely\nonto standard care procedures required fewer funds for\nresearch staff, even though these could have been sought\nas a legitimate research cost. The trialists' use of the fund-\ning system appeared to be as much a product of what they\nfelt was appropriate, given their research design and its\nrelation to the clinical environment in which it was\nplaced, as of the structure of the funding system itself.\nAn important element in this system for three of the trials\nwas the need to deal with the multiple funders, a tricky\nand often delicate process in its own right. It often\ninvolved nurturing and sustaining the interest of one\npotential funder whilst engaging with the (potentially dif-\nferent) concerns and priorities of another, a difficult jug-\ngling act which commenced sometimes years before the\ntrial could get underway. FOCUS, HPS and ELEVATE all\nexperienced major and ultimately significant funding-\nrelated delays, arising from their discussions with poten-\ntial funders. These delays meant that the circumstances in\nwhich the trials were eventually conducted were altered,\nallowing other research to have been developed or to\nreport in the meantime. Their experience suggests that\nefforts to facilitate the speedy progress of research through\nthe funding system would be of clear benefit to funders\nand applicants alike.\nOf particular significance was the fact that each of the\nthree main funders had the ability to shape the research in\nquite significant ways. The public sector research funders\n(MRC and HTA) intervened directly through the review\nprocess for applications for funds to ensure that their per-\nceptions of how the research ought to be conducted were\ntaken into account. The NHS Trusts and PCTs could block\nexpensive research in their area, despite the existence of\nfunding agreements such as the Concordat. The funding\nsector which raised the most discussion in the interviews\nwas, however, undoubtedly the pharmaceutical industry.\nThe extent of the influence, direct and indirect, that indus-\ntry appears to have over trials which do not in fact origi-\nnate within their own sphere was striking.\nCollaboration with industry can provide important\nmeans to run clinical trials [64,65] and was crucial to the\ndevelopment and ongoing progress of HPS, FOCUS and\nELEVATE. This form of support allowed the trialists to\nfinance the drugs necessary for their research, to have\nfunds at their disposal to facilitate important collabora-\ntions, and even to provide extra staff or equipment when\nneeded. Interviews with clinical staff in FOCUS collabo-\nrating centres suggested that lucrative collaborations with\nindustry trials helped to sustain an infrastructure which\nTrials 2006, 7:34 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/34\nPage 15 of 18\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nwas vital to their involvement with a range of public sector\nfunded trials.\nThe relationship with industry is, however, not without\nproblems. This \"uneasy alliance\" [5] of potentially com-\npeting aims has been likened to \"dancing with porcu-\npines\" [4,66]. Concerns which have been expressed to\ndate largely relate to the potential for conflict of interests\n[65,67-70]. The trialists interviewed here were very much\naware of the differences between their own research\nagenda which were focused on developments for patient\ncare, and the commercial agenda of the pharmaceutical\ncompanies. Research suggests that they are right to be cau-\ntious, demonstrating that links with industry can shape\nthe design and implementation and results of clinical tri-\nals [71-73]. Trials that are funded in this way are more\nlikely to produce \"pro-industry conclusions\" [74]. They\nare also becoming increasingly prevalent with concerns\nbeing expressed that control of the clinical research\nagenda is passing from academia to industry [75]. Those\ninterviewees who had participated in discussions over the\ndesign of their trials used terms such as \"stuck to our\nguns\", \"held our ground\" and \"stood firm\" to convey the\nchallenges involved in their negotiations. This research\nsuggests that there are also other ways in which the rela-\ntionship with industry might affect the research process.\nThe withdrawal of funds from FOCUS part-way through\nthe recruitment period highlights a degree of vulnerability\nfor trials which are reliant upon this type of funding.\nFOCUS is not alone in this experience as a number of tri-\nals have been forced to close when funds were withdrawn\nfor commercial reasons [76-79]. It also became clear that\nthere could be direct competition between the trials con-\nsidered here and other industry-led trials, either for the co-\noperation of collaborators or for access to eligible\npatients. In the case of ELEVATE the loss of whole groups\nof patients from GP practices in their geographical area\nseverely hampered their recruitment processes.\nTOuCAN stands alone in this study as a trial which is of\nlittle interest to industry. Trials which assess interventions\nwith little or no potential for commercial application are\nheavily reliant on charitable and public sector funding [3].\nHemminki and Kellokumpu-Lehtinen [7] suggest that the\nsame is true of cutting edge research in areas such as gene\ntherapy and cancer vaccines, with their complexities of\nintellectual property rights and manufacturing difficulties.\nThe particular needs of non-commercial trials have been\nacknowledged by the European Union [80]. Although\nsuch trials have fewer funding opportunities available to\nthem, it may be that TOuCAN benefited from a simple\nfunding process and did not require complex negotiations\nwith industry. It was the only trial of the four considered\nhere which was not perceived by the interviewees to be\naffected by financial difficulties. The not-inconsiderable\ntreatment costs associated with in-patient and out-patient\ncare which were assessed within this trial were met within\nexisting contractual agreements between service providers\nand the referring services. The smooth transition from pre-\nvious care arrangements to research-led procedures, map-\nping research onto an established practical and financial\nframework of referrals and delivery of an intervention,\ngave this trial a clear advantage. Freed from having to con-\nsider complicated practical and political issues of treat-\nment costs, and maintaining the support and interest of\nindustry funders, the central trial team were able to work\non engaging and motivating the linchpin collaborators in\nthe important clinical and scientific issues at the heart of\nthe trial.\nOnce the trials in this study had obtained their necessary\nfinances, they were still faced with financial considera-\ntions in the course of their research. The trial teams in this\nstudy acted in a number of dynamic ways to address\nunpredictable financial issues as they arose, and to pre-\nvent financial difficulties destabilising their trials. The\nELEVATE trialists for instance quickly secured the\nresources necessary to modify their approach to recruit-\nment and enable additional staff to be deployed where\nneeded.\nThe teams also had to find the strategies or means to bring\ntheir trials to completion. They were not at all unusual in\nobtaining extensions either in time or money or both.\nThis very common phenomenon amongst clinical trials\n[81] might occur for a number of reasons. Trials may be\nunder-funded in the first place, because it is so difficult to\npredict the actual level of funding that will be required, or\nbecause circumstances and so costs can change between\nthe application for funds and the recruitment period.\nTOuCAN required a funded extension because there were\nfewer eligible adolescents available than had been antici-\npated. It may also be the case that investigators strategi-\ncally under-bid in order to secure some funding, even if\nthis is unlikely to be sufficient for the entire trial.\nThe experiences reported here indicate that a range of\nskills and a degree of agility are required for negotiations\nwith potential funders and collaborators, and for the\nongoing financial balancing act that managing a trial with\nsubstantial research budgets entails. Those who are\nresponsible for these onerous tasks receive little, if any,\ntraining in this area. The development of systems to sup-\nport and train researchers in trial processes, such as those\nbeing provided by the UK Clinical Research Network [6]\nwould seem to be appropriate. It may also be desirable for\npublic sector funding bodies to demonstrate reciprocal\nskills and flexibility in assessing the financial plans of\nresearch applicants, assisting with the integration of their\nTrials 2006, 7:34 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/34\nPage 16 of 18\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nmulti-sourced funds, monitoring and supporting the\nprogress of on-going trials.\nThis qualitative study was based on four trials which were\nall identified by their funders as exemplars. It is probable\nthat the extension of this research to a larger number of\ntrials including those considered less successful would\nhave provided additional insights into this complex proc-\ness. The study was carried out in the UK in 2003\u201304 and\nthe four trials, each with their own timescale, had encoun-\ntered the funding process at different times in its evolu-\ntion. Some changes in resourcing arrangements have been\nmade since the interviews were conducted. There have\nbeen moves towards Full Economic Costing for research\nwhich may help to increase the transparency of funding\ndecisions and processes. The recent implementation of\nthe EU Clinical Trials Directive may mean that trials\nrequire even larger amounts of funding, thus making it\n\"all but impossible to carry out researcher-led studies\nwithout the financial and logistical backing of the phar-\nmaceutical industry\" [9]. Indeed, the problem of inade-\nquate funding for clinical trials was highlighted by the\nAcademy of Medical Sciences [64], which suggested the\nneed for a new funding structure and the development of\nan effective research infrastructure to aid efficient organi-\nsation of clinical research and training. The UK Clinical\nResearch Network [6] was established in 2005 to provide\nsuch an infrastructure, and early in 2006, plans for a sin-\ngle, ring-fenced budget to support the health research cur-\nrently funded by the MRC and HTA programmes were\nannounced for consultation [82].\nThe specifics of funding arrangements are bound to differ\nover time and between different countries. The important\ngeneral lesson from this study is the need for attention to\nbe paid, by funders and trialists, to the complex practical\nand financial aspects of planning and conducting a trial,\nwhatever the prevailing funding system. Given the likely\ninfluence of the level of funding on the degree of success\nof clinical trials, it is surprising that this element of the\nresearch process is virtually invisible in the research liter-\nature. A focus on the issues raised in the financial manage-\nment of research should be one part of the development\nand continuing assessment of methods which are aimed\nat facilitating the conduct of sound clinical research in the\nfuture.\nCompeting interests\nCS holds a fellowship partly funded by MRC.
