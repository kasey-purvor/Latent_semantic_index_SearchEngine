In \nEurope, for example, funding bodies from both private and public organisations appear to be \nincreasingly interested in interdisciplinary research as a method to address socio-\nenvironmental challenges (Luks et al., 2007). Researchers are responding to these new \ndemands adjusting their practice to address both the concerns of policy makers and interests \ngroups (Benner and S\u00f6rlin, 2007; Compalov et al., 2002). In addition, the social evaluation of \nresearch is generating an additional set of targets shaping the content and practice of scientific \nresearch (Lubchenco, 1998; Benner and S\u00f6rlin, 2007; Nowotny et al., 2006). \nScholars have long emphasised the need to understand the forces that drive, and the barriers \nthat restrict, the practice of interdisciplinary research (e.g. Klein, 1996; Nowotny et al., 2006; \nBrewer, 1999; Bruce et al., 2004; Frs, 1962; Griffin, 2006; Heathington et al., 1978; \nHukkinen, 2003; Jakobsen et al., 2004; Petts et al., 2008; Vincenti, 2005). Still, additional \nresearch is needed to complement previous efforts, like those in Weingart and Stehr (2000), \nabout what interdisciplinary research practices entail and how they are related to the research \npractice of more conventional single-discipline research.  \nThus, this paper focuses on the practice of interdisciplinarity and its relationship with \ninstitutionalised disciplines. The ideas contained in this paper emerged from discussions \nbetween the authors and the opportunity to meet researchers from a variety of backgrounds \nsharing an interest in environmental sustainability. To take advantage of such opportunity, the \nauthors of the paper undertook exploratory qualitative research aiming to understand the \npractice of interdisciplinary research in environmental sciences and its impacts on the careers \nof scientists who work outside of a single discipline. During this study, the researchers found \nit useful to describe disciplines as institutions. Institutions can be defined as conventions, \nnorms or formally sanctioned rules coordinating human action, in this case, the practice of \nresearch (Vatn, 2005). More specifically, interdisciplinarity can be regarded as institutional \ninterplay (Young, 2002). Using such an institutional conceptualisation as a departure point, \nqualitative research was carried out to engage with the practice of interdisciplinary research \nand its relationship with disciplinary institutions.  \nOften, tensions emerge between disciplinary and interdisciplinary research, as current \ndisciplinary institutions appear to hinder the practice of interdisciplinarity. However, this \npaper argues, disciplines are important points of reference for the practice of \ninterdisciplinarity. The following section explores the current literature on interdisciplinary \nresearch. Section two presents the methodology used in this study, and section three explains \nthe results obtained. Finally, section four discusses the results in the light of the literature to \nconclude that there are important synergies between disciplinary and interdisciplinary \nresearch.  \n1- Disciplines and interdisciplinary research: institutions \nand interplay  \nFor the purposes of this paper, interdisciplinary research is defined as research that cuts across \ndisciplines. The term interdisciplinary research is also related to multidisciplinary and trans-\ndisciplinary research. Multidisciplinary research occurs when different disciplines work \ntogether on a defined problem without influencing each other (Max-Neef, 2005). \nTransdisciplinary research cuts across different knowledge cultures including academics and \n3 \nwhat is commonly referred to as \u201elay\u201f communities (e.g. Mittelstra\u00df, 2001; Klein, 2004; Max-\nNeef 2005). This paper focuses on research that goes beyond the addition of results from \ndifferent disciplines (multidisciplinary research), but does not extent beyond the practices of \nacademic researchers. Thus, the paper focuses exclusively on interdisciplinary research.  \nThe concept of interdisciplinary research dates back to the 1930s\u201f procedures of the Social \nScience Research Council of the United States of America dealing with the collaboration of \nmore than two professional societies (Klein, 1996). By the 1980s Clifford Geertz had brought \ninterdisciplinarity into the scientific discourse by stating the need for \u201egenre mixing\u201f in the \nsocial sciences and humanities (Geertz, 1980). More recently, interdisciplinary research and \ncollaboration among scientists has increased significantly. The reasons for such a rise are \nvaried. Interdisciplinary research may be regarded as: \n the result of changes associated with knowledge-based economies (Hicks and Katz, \n1996);  \n a necessary turn away from reductionist approaches to scientific progress (Lessard, \n2007); \n a response to the challenges of an increasingly complex world (Latour, 1998; \nLubchenco, 1998; Nowotny et al., 2006);  \n an approach to refine tools for practical work (Hukkinen, 2003); or  \n a complementary element to ongoing specialisation in knowledge production \n(Weingart, 2000).  \nResearchers have also pointed to the difficulties of drawing boundaries between disciplinarity \nand interdisciplinarity as forms of knowledge production (Klein, 1996; Mittelstra\u00df 2001). For \nexample, researchers do not necessarily share the same understanding of interdisciplinary \nresearch (Vincenti, 2005). Aram (2004) observes that interdisciplinary research derives from \nthe confluence, fusion or synthesis of disciplinary knowledge and from the re-definition of the \ndisciplines. Some argue that the \u201ere-imagination\u201f of disciplines is already occurring as \ndisciplines are now producing numerous specialisms, often overlapping and intermixing \nacross social and natural sciences (Ramadier, 2004; see also Klein, 1996; Mittelstra\u00df, 2001). \nHowever, despite possibly changing roles, Klein (1996) insists that disciplines continue to \nbear core elements of current forms of knowledge production. Such views suggest that \ndisciplinary and interdisciplinary research may be closer than is commonly understood.  \nInstitutions can be defined as those sets of conventions, norms and formally sanctioned rules \nconstructed by societies that coordinate and regulate human interactions (Vatn, 2005). \nDisciplines can be understood as institutions that coordinate the production of knowledge. \nGenerally, disciplines contain a set of instructions on how to generate knowledge including \nsubject definitions, conceptual approaches, cognitive structures, goals and norms (Klein, \n1996). Such constructs constrain the research activity that occurs within disciplinary spheres \n(Petts et al., 2008). According to Good (2000) disciplines are historical entities that can be \nseen as changing frameworks organising scientific activities. Disciplines are used to address \nwell-defined issues but they are transformed over time to the extent that the initial logic and \npractices of a discipline may disappear (Good, 2000). In the late twentieth century such \nprocesses may have been accelerated by a re-contextualisation of disciplines, a weakening of \ndisciplinary boundaries and an alteration of identities, which all led to changes in canons, \ncodes and categories of knowledge production processes (Klein, 1996).  \n4 \nFormerly unchallenged knowledge and expertise hierarchies may be called into question by a \nwide array of scientific communities and the public (Klein, 1996; Wynne 1996). Individual \nresearchers or groups of researchers can expand or break the boundaries of disciplines to \ndifferent degrees and hence facilitate interdisciplinary research, even though interdisciplinary \nresearch is mediated by the structures of power that draw the boundaries between disciplinary \nand interdisciplinary research (Klein, 1996). Therefore, one could understand interdisciplinary \nresearch as occurring in the \u201eborder areas\u201f between disciplines (Klein, 1996). However, in \npractice, the borders may be more amorphous than anticipated. Bibliometric research reveals \nthat there exists substantial boundary-crossing between disciplines in terms of authorship of \npublications and readership (Pierce, 1999). Lau and Pasquini (2008) assert that disciplinarity \nand interdisciplinarity are under constant negotiation, at least within the field of geography.  \nChallenges to interdisciplinary researchers emerge from the working practices of those \nindividuals who strongly adhere to the institutions of a discipline and their operation within \norganisations. In his \u201eStructure of Scientific Revolutions\u201f, Kuhn (1962) provides a detailed \naccount of the process of knowledge reproduction through textbooks and the reproduction of \nknowledge in higher education institutions. Disincentives resulting from academic reward \nstructures and evaluation procedures, almost entirely developed along disciplinary lines, \nconstitute serious barriers to interdisciplinary research (Heathington et al., 1978; Vincenti, \n2005; Lau and Pasquini, 2008). For example, one of the vehicles for the reproduction of \ndisciplinary institutions is the educational process. Education is produced through a series of \nformally sanctioned rules, exams, research projects, and practical work, all within the \ncontours of particular disciplines. Such institutions have been commonly identified as one of \nthe main obstacles for interdisciplinarity (Frs, 1962). Single-discipline education is still \npredominant in higher education (Max-Neef, 2005). The literature suggests that disciplinary \ninstitutions will continue to be reproduced and, as a result, the education programmes of \nfuture scientists will be based on the single-discipline tradition. Once education is completed, \nthe researcher will be encouraged to remain within a single discipline by a range of \ndisciplinary institutions such as: the dominance of disciplinary publishing for career \nadvancement (Griffin, 2006; Campbell, 2005); the review processes of funding proposals \n(Griffin, 2006; Porter and Rossini, 1985); and the performance indicators used within \nuniversity departments (Bourke and Butler, 1998). Some recent research suggests that \nresearchers may struggle to obtain recognition for interdisciplinary research from \ntraditionalist research institutions, such as scientific journals (e.g. Tress et al., 2006).  \nThe practice of research and interaction with other researchers further develops the single \ndiscipline orientation. For example, Sundberg (2007) reports that individuals who are setting \nup experiments, even within collaborative contexts, may not be able to question experts on \nthe use of particular instruments. This division of scientific labour often requires scientists to \nreproduce well-known conventions already embedded within their discipline. Moreover such \ndivision of labour requires that research groups adopt specific types of organisation, which \nmay further hinder interdisciplinary collaboration (see Hollingsworth and Hollingsworth, \n2000). For example, Chompalov et al. (2002) found that the strict standards imposed by \nfunding agencies of particle physics lead research groups to develop structures that lacked the \nflexibility required to collaborate with other research groups (let alone other disciplines). \nMoreover, in loosely structured groups the emergence of ambiguous or undefined tasks may \nlead researchers to revert back to pre-existing disciplinary norms and structures (McCorcle, \n1982).  \nThe adoption of rigid research protocols and hierarchies within the context of single discipline \nresearch can also be found within interdisciplinary research teams. One of the major obstacles \nreported for interdisciplinarity is the requirement that researchers operate within methods and \n5 \ntheories used within their home disciplines (Frs, 1962). Petrie (1976) suggested that, in order \nto gain mutual understanding, individuals need to learn the observational categories and \nconcepts of other disciplines involved (see Bromme, 2000). This process, however, may take \nseveral years (Pohl, 2005; Campbell, 2005; Vincenti, 2005; Klein, 2006).   \nThe literature discussed suggests that understanding disciplines as institutions and \ninterdisciplinary research as occurring within the interplay of these institutions may help to \nconceptualise the barriers to interdisciplinary research. These include conventions, norms and \nrules that are specifically stipulated within the institutional construction of disciplines and the \norganisation of science in general. They seem connected to more complex methodological \nand theoretical conventions, which frequently escape the attention of the analyst (see \nPickering, 1995). Daniel Bromley (2006) describes disciplines as interpretive or epistemic \ncommunities in which a community of practitioners is bound by specific agreements \nregarding questions thought worthwhile to ask and covering laws consisting of axioms and \ntruth claims. These epistemic institutions imply not only certain assumptions and applicability \npostulates, but also methods of inquiry (Bromley, 2006). Experts, including researchers, are \nheld accountable by the discipline to which they belong (Bromley, 2006). As a result, \nresearchers tend to refer to established institutions in the process of fixing their beliefs on how \nthey are prepared to act as professionals who are embedded within particular disciplinary and \nsocial contexts (see Bromley, 2006). Consequently, when disciplinary agreement relating to \nassertions they are making is absent, these arguments lose their legitimacy (Bromley, 2006). \nThis may limit the opportunities of a researcher to embrace principles of other disciplines and \ncould be an important determinant of interdisciplinary research practices in the interplay of \ndisciplinary institutions.  \nInterplay is a concept that is used in institutional analysis to refer to the interactions between \nand among institutions at similar and different levels of social organisation (Young, 2002). \nHorizontal interplay occurs among institutions at similar levels of social organisation, while \nvertical interplay occurs when certain institutions are influenced by institutional arrangements \ndetermined at higher or lower levels of social organisation (Young, 2002). For example, \nhorizontal interplay occurs between different disciplines because they are institutions at the \nsame level of social organisation. However, these institutions are also influenced by other \ninstitutions at higher and lower levels of social organisation such as governmental policies \nthat influence science, funding structures, and even social conventions in everyday \ninteractions between researchers and other actors. Interdisciplinary research can thus be \ndefined as the interplay between epistemic institutions. The resulting conceptualisation of \ninterdisciplinarity places researchers in an institutional context that influences their \ninterdisciplinary practices, whilst researchers themselves can also transform interdisciplinary \npractices and respective institutions.  \nThis approach is different to previous conceptualisations of interdisciplinary research as \nscientific communities (e.g. Newman 2000), epistemic communities (Haas, 1992), \ntransepistemic arenas (Knorr-Cetina, 1982) or seeing disciplines as intentional organisations \n(Turner, 2000). Traditional concepts of scientific communities have approached the \nproduction of science as the aggregation of the actions of individual scientists, thus applying a \nmethodological individualist paradigm to analyse these processes. Institutional analysis, in \ncontrast, emphasises the existence of social structures that shape individual behaviour. \nHowever, the definition of institutions proposed here does not preclude the possibility of \nhuman agency influencing institutions. Instead, this approach intends to bridge \nmethodological individualism and structuralist approaches to understand disciplines and \ninterdisciplinary research. \n6 \nThe concept of epistemic communities as developed by Haas (1992) is close to an \nunderstanding of disciplines as institutions. Epistemic communities can be understood as \nnetworks of professionals sharing a core of beliefs. The core of beliefs provides the basis for \nindividual action and establishes criteria to validate these actions within a particular epistemic \ncommunity. The main difference with the approach presented here is the dependence of the \nnotion of epistemic communities on the consensus of its members. Thus, structural constraints \nshaping epistemic communities are only effective as long as its members agree upon them. \nThis notion may fail to recognise that the process of dissension and questioning have also a \ngreat impact in the formation and reproduction of disciplines.  \nWithin this paper, disciplines are studied as institutions and interdisciplinary research as \ninstitutional interplay. The hypothesis is that disciplinary institutions shape the practice of \ninterdisciplinary research, whether hindering or facilitating it. Thus, this paper explores how \ndisciplinary institutions are embedded within the practice of interdisciplinary research, \naccording to the accounts of researchers involved in interdisciplinary projects.  \n2- Methodology  \nThe research aimed at understanding the interdisciplinary practices of researchers working in \nenvironmental sciences and related fields. The sample was drawn opportunistically, using the \nresearchers\u201f contacts, and included internationally recognised researchers that participate in \ninterdisciplinary projects addressing environmental and sustainability issues. The sample \nincluded nine researchers with a range of socio-cultural backgrounds, age and nationality (see \nadditional detail in Table 1). All interviewees had participated in interdisciplinary research \nprojects bridging the natural and the social sciences. Most of them explained that they had \nreceived a single discipline education or an education based on two disciplines; however, \nsome of them had received additional interdisciplinary training at later stages of their research \ncareer. Each interviewee had extensive experience working interdisciplinarily on empirical \nand theoretical issues in the field of sustainable development in diverse environmental, social, \npolitical and cultural contexts. Because the sample was selected using the researchers\u201f \ncontacts, the sample has a bias towards social sciences, in particular, economics.  \nTABLE 1 \nIn-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted with each participant. The interviews lasted \nbetween forty-five minutes and one hour. An interview guide was used consisting of themes, \nwhich were raised through open-ended questions during the interview process. The key \nquestions focused on how researchers operate within their institutional context. The goal of \nthe interviews was to explore with these scholars their impressions of interdisciplinarity, the \nrole of scientific knowledge producers within society and their reasons for taking an \ninterdisciplinary approach to sustainable development research. Four overarching themes \nemerged out of the interviews, as they were issues of importance for all research participants. \nThey constitute the conceptual strands of this analysis, as detailed in Table 2. \nTABLE 2 \nFurther analysis examined how the different accounts given by the researchers reflected the \nemergence of interplay between disciplinary institutions. In particular the analysis looked at \nhow research practices were shaped by disciplinary institutions. The following section \npresents the results in four sections: 1) the context in which interdisciplinary research occurs; \n2) the individual practice of interdisciplinary research; 3) interdisciplinary research as a social \npractice; and 4) cross-referencing between disciplinary and interdisciplinary research. \n7 \n3- Results \nThe context of interdisciplinary research \nHigher education organisations may be considered to be the contact point of individuals with \nresearch, and their initiation in disciplinary institutions. Some interviewees explained that \nthey had made the decision to work in a university because relative to working in government \nor industry, the university provided more freedom and intellectual stimulus.  \nHowever, the tension between intellectual freedom and the limitations that researchers \nexperienced in the academic context was a recurrent theme. Each research participant had \nexperienced challenges from the university when undertaking interdisciplinary research. \nWithin the university context, however, these came from various levels:  \n1) ministerial and funding bodies which did not support or could not understand the need \nfor interdisciplinary research;  \n2) universities that had little enthusiasm for interdisciplinary research; \n3) university departments that did not support interdisciplinary research; and \n4) colleagues who were hostile to taking an interdisciplinary approach within their \nparticular epistemic community. \nInterviewees highlighted the responsibility of the university in promoting intellectual \nfreedom: if a university does not support a research initiative, it tends to fail. Yet, the \ninstitutions, which govern action within a university, evolve through multiple interactions \nbetween the individuals that belong to the university. Some interviewees expressed their \nfrustration with the way disciplinary institutions continue to be reproduced, often in spite of \ntheir efforts to work for change:  \n [For university officials an] image of the university was formed in graduate school and they \nsaid 'Ah, well the way the university is structured is THIS way.'  And I always wondered where \ndid they come up with the idea that that was the ideal structure of the university...It is because \nthat was [the way it was] when they went to university....  So you see, what we take as the \nnormal structure of disciplines and science, teaching and socialization itself is constructed, \nisn't it? (R1, PhD, Male) \nFollowing this argument, universities appear to be \u201emanifestations of the power structure\u201f \ninfluenced by the same constraints that shape other organisations with less \u201eintellectual \nfreedom\u201f to say what they want. The same interviewee continued his argument:    \nJust because someone works at the university and not on the payroll of Monsanto or Pioneer \nor whoever, don't assume that they have a better fix on truth than anybody else, right, because \nuniversities, research institutions, themselves must get funding from someone - from a \nfoundation, from the government... (R1, PhD, Male). \nMost interviewees shared a preoccupation with the role of the universities. In addition, \nresearchers also expressed their concerns about the influence of other organisations on their \nresearch. For example, another interviewee explained that interdisciplinary research was \nhindered by how funding bodies support research projects and promote the development of \nnew teaching programmes. All interviewees called for shifts in the funding mandates and \naccreditation systems of university programs. An environmental researcher stated that in \nGermany, to enable \u201ereal\u201f interdisciplinary research, universities and departments need more \nautonomy from the Ministries because the latter gives the final approval for new teaching \n8 \nprogrammes. Another interviewee expressed frustration with national research funding \nmandates: \nNational funding now only supports policy projects and they don't support primary research.  \n(\u2026) [But] for the social sciences it is impossible to say that you will just take primary research \nfrom somewhere else.  You can't do that.  You need to have your own people who know your \nown arena in order to be able to analyze what is going on (R2, PhD, Female).  \nThis interviewee seems to suggest that the funding bodies\u201f emphasis on policy projects does \nnot favour interdisciplinary research as it is commonly assumed. Instead, she explains that to \nparticipate in policy projects of an interdisciplinary nature, she also needs funding for primary \nresearch to create a knowledge base so she can understand \u201ewhat is going on\u201f.  \nNot everything is seen negative, however, as all interviewees had successfully secured funds \nfor conducting interdisciplinary research. However, some research participants suggested that \ntheir funding required them to revise their research agendas. This led interviewees to explore \ndifferent avenues to support their research ranging from funding independent research \nprivately (with one\u201fs own funds) while others depended almost exclusively on national \nresearch councils.  \nYet, interviewees reported examples in which funding bodies\u201f intervention has fostered, not \nhindered, interdisciplinary research. For example, one ecological economist applauded the \nGerman Ministry of Education for commissioning a neoclassical economic research institute \nto develop an ecologically oriented economic solution to a practical policy issue. This project \nwas a strategic success, as the institute became a more cooperative contributor to sustainable \ndevelopment. In this case the government took responsibility for encouraging the research \ncommunity to contribute constructively to the sustainable development agenda through the \nway it distributed its research funds. \nIn another example, an environmental economist discussed the political and social impact \ncreated by an interview in the Financial Times with the Czech Republic President\u201fs \npresentation to the U.S. Senate in which he raised the issue of rights and freedoms within \ninternational efforts to address climate change. In her opinion the Czech President challenged \nthe use of scientific knowledge by different interest groups and as a result:  \n[He] initiated debate in newspapers about the role of scientists and the role of politicians and \nabout the perception of climate change. And people have started to think about it, to develop \narguments, and to discuss it and to present opinions. (\u2026) [I]t has definitely promoted \ndiscussion and critical thinking on both sides and got people looking for specific arguments \nbased on the need to convince the other party about the story (R3, PhD, Female). \nA sense that interdisciplinary research is widely supported at the policy level, although this \nsupport does not necessarily correspond with the specific actions of funding donors and \nscience evaluation organisations, emerges from these interviews. For example, within a \nuniversity, interdisciplinary research may be officially supported but structurally and \nideologically unsupported:  \nIn my university we have big problems because [it] is still a very traditional organization; it \nstill needs a lot of \u2018transitioning\u2019.  It is very much felt that interdisciplinary cooperation is \nexpected and welcome but in reality it's not (R2, PhD, Female). \nBoth within funding agencies and higher education institutions it appears that an official \ncommitment to do interdisciplinary research is not sufficient to have such research done. This \napparent contradiction points to the resilience of disciplinary institutions to which science \nrefers and explains why researchers may find it challenging working within the interplay \nbetween disciplines when conducting interdisciplinary research. \n9 \nFor example, several interviewees had firsthand experience working in university departments \nthat had taken decisions to actively hinder interdisciplinary work. As a consequence, \ninterdisciplinary researchers felt like outsiders and eventually took radical decisions, such as \nto leave the department of their \u201ehome discipline\u201f in order to work in a more constructive \nprofessional environment:  \nI left [the department]... this year after a process, where I actually had established the \nteaching programme I wanted to have, but I still felt it became more and more alien to what \nthe department did and wanted to do (R4, PhD, Male).  \nThis interviewee expressed that it was painful to leave his \u201ehome discipline\u201f, which continues \nto act as a reference point for his research.  \nMore formally, interdisciplinary researchers may be threatened by the way their work is \nevaluated within university promotion and tenure systems. In many countries promotion is \nlinked to the contribution that individual researchers make to their department\u201fs ability to \nattract core funding. Ways in which individual scholars\u201f contributions are ranked include their \nteaching, departmental service, success in attracting research grants and publishing. All \nresearch participants had published in peer-reviewed journals and many also had books in \ncirculation. However, a few interviewees felt that their record of publication was less likely to \nadvance their careers than those of colleagues that had kept their work within one disciplinary \ntradition. Here again it was observed that the disciplines are perpetuated by the establishment \nof formally sanctioned rules and expressed, in this case, in the form of reduced performance \nin career advancement indicators.  \nPractice of research \nConsidering the difficulties in doing interdisciplinary research and the challenges that \ninterdisciplinary research poses for a scientist\u201fs career, one inevitably wonders about what \nmotivates certain people to become involved in interdisciplinary research. Some of the \ninterviewees reflected on this issue when talking about their students and their own \nresponsibility as educators. Interviewees expressed concern about educating students in \nmultiple disciplines because they anticipate that their students will have more difficult career \ntrajectories than peers who choose a traditional path. \nAt the same time, interviewees emphasised the importance of acquiring appropriate \ndisciplinary training. The notion of postgraduate training as a form of apprenticeship was also \nexpressed when certain research participants suggested that in order to have an academic \ncareer it was important for students to first learn a disciplinary craft. Once they had met all the \ntraining standards and succeeded in securing a place in the academy, students could embark \non more creative and \u201erisky\u201f interdisciplinary work.  \nThe opportunity to undertake interdisciplinary research programmes was also regarded as a \nrelatively new option for students. The research participants were university students between \nthe late 1970s and early 1990s and found that typically there were few interdisciplinary \nprogrammes during this time. They described undertaking interdisciplinary research via one \nof three avenues: \n1) As a result of being required by employers to work in interdisciplinary teams; \n2) As a result of circumstance, for example the need for interdisciplinary collaboration in \norder to solve a practical problem; or \n10 \n3) As a result of a conscious effort to work interdisciplinarily because it was felt to be the \nbest way to address a particular issue of concern. \nThe reasons for continuing to do interdisciplinary research were varied. Some interviewees \nstated that given the agenda setting activities of universities, they should assume the \nresponsibility to support research designed to generate novel insights, even when it poses \nchallenges to existing political, economic and social institutions. The realisation that \nuniversities may somehow be dependent upon vested interests of third party organisations \nbecause of their reliance on the funding accessed through them explains why the \nresponsibility for innovation is often transferred from the university to individual researchers. \nOn the other hand, research participants felt that their careers were also rewarding because \nthey enriched their lives both personally and professionally. Interviewees felt that doing what \nthey believed in, mastering a breadth of issues, and developing knowledge and skills that \nenabled them to combine different types of knowledge was deeply satisfying. The resounding \nsentiment expressed in the interviews was that if people combine knowledge and have a \ncertain quality of mind and personality they will enjoy conducting interdisciplinary research \ndespite, and because of, its challenges. \nResearchers appear to have operational freedom if they remain disciplinary uncommitted. \nWithin this freedom there is not only responsibility for others but also the need to confront \none\u201fs own preconceptions, disciplinary habits and zones of comfort. In this sense, one of the \nmajor challenges to the practice of interdisciplinary research came from the researchers \nthemselves. Interviewees described a \u201efear\u201f of doing interdisciplinary research. For example, \none interviewee explained that it is disorienting to step beyond one\u201fs discipline and into \narenas that are conceptually and methodologically unfamiliar: \nIf you have a hammer everything is a nail...  when you go beyond that you feel like you are on \nextremely shaky ground. And I understand it; I have had that feeling myself. But the only way \nto go about things is ... to be willing to try to develop new models even though you know that \nyou will not be able to produce in the most famous journals before someone is able to break \nthis new ground (R9, PhD, Male). \nInterviewees found several reasons behind that fear of abandoning one\u201fs home discipline. The \nfirst was becoming inappropriately confident in one\u201fs understanding of another discipline: \nThe danger that I often am afraid of is that I read two books in a field and then since I see \nsome connections between that field and the one I work with, I feel quite certain I have \nunderstood what it is about. So the danger may be that you have simplified things too much \n(R4, PhD, Male).  \nThe second is losing contact with one\u201fs own knowledge. Interdisciplinary work brings \nresearchers together to contribute their own disciplinary knowledge to a collective research \nproject. The goal is therefore to produce greater insight into the subject and not to exclude \ncertain bodies of knowledge: \nIn interdisciplinarity the idea is not that you completely outsource the answer to your question \nand then you say you don\u2019t know about it and then you get disconnected from what you do \nknow...that gets dangerous. I think that the point of interdisciplinarity is to work with someone \nwho has better knowledge or a different view and then to try and combine [different points of \nview] (R5, PhD, Male). \nThe third is figuring out how to use knowledge one has learned through reading other \ndisciplines without formal training and to use it in such a way that the work  as rigorous: \nI have been reading brain sciences lately because I am working on some issues concerning ... \nhow we choose [as economic agents]...Reading brain science helps me to sort out the question \n\u2018is there plurality out there?\u2019 So it\u2019s a way to try to build a stronger argument... But [can I use \n11 \nwork] from only two groups in brain science? Can I take the chance of going public and \nsaying this? (R4, PhD, Male). \nParadoxically the results seem to suggest that being educated in specific disciplines can \nenable researchers\u201f to freely pursue interdisciplinary research programmes. This dynamic is \nclarified when reading interdisciplinarity through the lens of institutional theory. First and \nforemost, interdisciplinary research cannot exist without the disciplines themselves. As one of \nthe interviewees highlights, the objective of interdisciplinary research is not to become \ndisconnected from one\u201fs original discipline(s) but rather to push the boundaries of a \ndiscipline, including questioning its main tenets. Creating and working within these tensions \ncannot be done without understanding what the main beliefs of the discipline are and where \nthe borders of the discipline are drawn. Therefore, interdisciplinary research occurs only \nwithin the interplay of disciplines and needs those disciplines as points of reference.  \nInterdisciplinary research as a social practice \nA cornerstone of interdisciplinary research for all interviewees was the practice of working \ncollaboratively with people trained in other disciplines. The goal of such collaborations was \nepistemologically grounded because it was felt that such an approach would enhance their \nunderstanding of sustainability issues. As a result, developing strategies for how to best \nassemble an interdisciplinary research team emerged as a key priority within the practice of \nconducting interdisciplinary research.  \nThe methods used by research participants to select groups varied. When forming groups, \nsome selected members that they had worked with in the past because through these previous \nworking processes they had the opportunity to evaluate the collaborative strengths of various \nresearchers. Others assembled groups based on their sense that the researchers complemented \neach other well. Once assembled, in order to develop the group\u201fs cohesion the research \nparticipants set their groups tasks such as producing deliverables (e.g. a book) before \nembarking upon larger research projects. Although team members were selected on account \nof their expertise in various disciplines, all research participants agreed that when assembling \na successful interdisciplinary working group the potential candidates\u201f understanding of \nscience was less important than their ability to work collaboratively. \nResearch participants also addressed the notion that each discipline understands \u201econtext\u201f in a \ndifferent way. Therefore, to work on interdisciplinary teams people need a basic \nunderstanding of the principles of the other disciplines represented in the group.  \nMany times we have started to do interdisciplinary work but it becomes evident that people \nare too narrow in their disciplines and the result is that they put non-connected pieces about \none problem on the table. And so sometimes the projects fail or somehow we don't really \nproduce a holistic result (R5, PhD, Male). \nParticipants felt that researchers should reflect upon their values and be able to defend the \nvalidity of them. Reflexivity was also important in that if a scientist is challenged and finds \nher or his position indefensible then that position requires rethinking:  \nWe have our own values ... the subject area we select is based on our personal values and you \ncan never get away from that ...  I cannot say that I have a better solution to a question than \nothers ...[but I have to ask] does it make sense for society? Is this knowledge that society \nneeds? And then the question comes... who judges? (R6, PhD, Male). \nInterviewees suggested that, when working with teams, interdisciplinary collaborators must \ndevelop understanding not only at the intellectual level (i.e. a basic agreement about theory \nand methods) but also at the personal level (i.e. as a person with an open minded character \n12 \nwho is willing to re-evaluate pre-conceived notions about an issue). Clearly, the assemblage \nof a team is central to the successful development of interdisciplinary research.  \nIn contrast, working with colleagues outside of interdisciplinary teams was often met with \ndisinterest, competition and hostility when issues of ideological and theoretical difference \ncame to the fore in departmental business. In one example a intervieweee explained why he \ncould not conduct interdisciplinary research with his immediate colleagues: \n\u2026[everybody is] guarding their small garden.  Many times it's actually for financial reasons \nand not for scientific reasons. And of course the specificity of my institution also is that this is \nan organization where either you have natural scientists, so pure natural scientists who don't \nsee any need to co-operate with social scientists, or you have technicians who are, I would \nsay, pure technicians and don't really think about the influence of humans on the techniques\u2026 \n(R5, PhD, Male). \nThis interviewee went on to explain that his colleagues saw little need to look for \ncollaboration beyond their particular disciplinary speciality. In other cases research \nparticipants dealt with more direct hostility from colleagues. Words they used to describe how \nthey thought colleagues perceive them included: \u201epuzzled\u201f, \u201econtroversial\u201f and \u201eI think they \nhate me\u201f. Hostility was primarily aroused when colleagues felt that a research participant was \nchallenging the fundamental tenets of a discipline.  \nPeople [in my discipline] find people like me inconvenient.  They don't know what to do with \nme because I don't subscribe to the catechism.  \u2026  You know what, a discipline is more like a \nreligion \u2026 where you come into a community and adhere to the rules of community and you \nagree to live by them, to abide by them... (R1, PhD, Male). \nThe interviewee perceives here that colleagues are hostile towards him because his research \nchallenges the conventions of their discipline. As the researcher explains, disciplines have \nnorms not only for knowledge production but also for guiding the interaction of researchers \nwithin the community. This results in the creation of \u201edisciplinary camps\u201f. For example, an \ninterviewee described the relationship between Ecological Economics and Environmental \nEconomics, two sub-disciplines apparently concerned with the same objects of study:  \n[T]here is an International Society for Ecological Economics.  There is also an Association \nfor Environmental and Resource Economics.  These are two different tribes and they rarely \nspeak to one another.  \u2026  So you take your pick, which tribe are you are going to belong to?  \nSo I belong to both.  And so what that means is that the environmental resource economists \nhave decided that they will ignore me (R1, PhD, Male). \n \nCross-referencing between disciplinary and interdisciplinary research \nThe interviewees can be roughly divided in two groups according to how they understood \nthemselves to be interdisciplinary. One group described themselves as interdisciplinary \nscholars because they had studied more than one discipline and therefore possess the ability to \ncombine at least two disciplinary views when conducting their own work. The other group \ndescribed themselves as being rooted in one discipline and using diverse intellectual activities \nto enhance their understanding of practical problems to communicate effectively with \ncolleagues working in other fields. This second group of researchers felt that people have to \nunderstand their own craft in order to solve problems and make valuable contributions to \ncollective initiatives: \n[To solve problems we need] people who are extremely deep and competent in a discipline, in \nan epistemic community, but who can talk with respect to people from other epistemic \ncommunities. \u2026  So in that sense I am a believer in multi-disciplinary work for problem \nsolving but disciplinary work for creating epistemic understanding.  \u2026  But understand that \n13 \ncreating an epistemic community is different from solving the problem of sustainability, or \nGMO crops or something else.  So we need both. (R1, PhD, Male).   \nOne researcher recommended that interdisciplinary groups should have a balanced \nrepresentation of disciplines as this may encourage an ethos of equal respect for all the \ndisciplinary institutions represented in the group. This group composition may also enhance \nand facilitate communication and group learning: \nAt least a quarter of the members of your group should understand what you are talking \nabout. Then you can explain it to the rest of the people. But of course you have the learning \nprocess.  But you need to have somebody else who is helping you to get messages across (R2, \nPhD, Female). \nUnderstanding the academic milieu as well as the ontological, epistemological, and \nmethodological orientations of colleagues were key ingredients of successful interdisciplinary \ncollaborations. Research participants highlighted four ways in which this disciplinary \nunderstanding becomes important: \n1) Understanding the preoccupations of each member of a team when developing \nconcrete solutions. For example, one environmental economist expressed frustration \nbecause the costs and benefits she had identified for various scenarios were not \nconsidered important by ecologists and thus, the collaboration broke down;  \n2) Understanding the methodological tools available within each discipline, which \nhelped researchers building realistic expectations about what a particular discipline \nhas the capacity to address;  \n3) Understanding the conversations each discipline is having about the subject being \nstudied;  \n4) Understanding the professional costs and benefits for team members of doing \ninterdisciplinary research and using this information to develop deliverables and\/or \npublications that facilitate the career development of all team members.  \nDisciplines are, therefore, a point of reference for interdisciplinary research in that not only do \nthey provide the researcher with a foundation of knowledge but they also set rules of \ncommunication between researchers. At the same time part of the frustration in doing \ninterdisciplinary research was related to the need to transcend disciplinary institutions by \ncreating new frames of reference for research:  \nSo it needs to become something new... that combines social and ecological aspects or social \nresearch and ecological research and brings them together with other concepts which are \nfamiliar in both cases but that build [an understanding of] the concept using a new approach... \nand to make sure that none of them dominate (R2, PhD, Female). \nWithin the context of research for sustainable development, developing trust between natural \nand social scientists is deemed important because creating a conceptual framework using one \nscience and inserting knowledge from another does not work in practice. Some felt that new \nframeworks were needed because existing disciplinary institutions did not allow for finding a \nmiddle ground between the disciplines: \nIt is not such a problem to be interdisciplinary as long as you are working with the same \nmethods.  In the natural sciences they work more or less with the same methods and in the \nsocial sciences, again, the methods are similar. But when you bring the natural and social \nsciences together the methods change, the scales are different ... So that is why I think that \ninterdisciplinarity is difficult work, it is difficult to create a paradigm that the sciences can \nshare (R5, PhD, Male). \n14 \nThis quote suggests that existing disciplines may not be providing space needed for interplay; \nhence interdisciplinary research is challenging. Similarly, many interviewees expressed their \nconcern that truly inter-disciplinary research would require going beyond conventional \ndisciplines and creating new research institutions - new norms, new rules, and new \nconventions to guide collaboration.  \n4- Discussion and Conclusion \nWithin the interviews conducted, research participants highlighted the dependence of \ninterdisciplinary research on disciplinary institutions at three levels: 1. organisational \n(university, research organisations, funding bodies), 2. research community (research \ncolleagues, and project team members) and 3. individual practices. Disciplinary institutions \nregulate which questions to ask, theories and methods to be employed in which context and \nwhich truth claims to make (see Bromley, 2006; Pickering, 1995). In this study, the empirical \ndata suggests that disciplines set rules for behaviour within interdisciplinary communities.  \nThe research practice appears to be shaped by explicit norms embedded in the discipline. \nSome of them influence the career of the researcher (e.g. the need for formal education within \na discipline, the structures of promotion and recognition). Other explicit norms are related to \nthe research practice, particularly regarding the range of methodologies applicable and the \nrules to implement them. Finally, explicit norms embedded in disciplines influence the \nrelationship of the researcher with institutions at other organisational levels. For example, \nfunding structures may be shaped according to disciplinary conventions. Some interviewees \nexplained that interdisciplinary work depended on funding for primary research alongside \nproject-based funding, because this was needed to develop the researchers\u201f knowledge base. \nIn addition, the research practice may also be shaped by implicit conventions, some of which \ncould be very specific to each particular discipline. Some of these conventions appear to \ngovern what is considered acceptable knowledge within a particular discipline and the limits \nof intellectual freedom.  \nSome researchers referred to the research as a craft, and described the process of acquiring \nresearch skills as an apprenticeship. This suggests that research requires not only mastering \nthe knowledge and norms of disciplines but also learning other practices established by usage \nand disciplinary habits, customary conventions that are not necessarily embedded in \ntextbooks. Some of these \u201ecraft skills\u201f were considered essential for the success of \ninterdisciplinary research: familiarity with concepts and methods, the ability to both defend \nand criticise one\u201fs own discipline(s) and the need to understand the full complexity of \nproblems appears to require a good understanding of the disciplinary field.  \nThis analysis suggests that disciplinary institutions may question both the validity of the \nresults of the interdisciplinary researcher and the ethos of these researchers. The effects of this \nintra-community regulation are related to the dissatisfaction that interdisciplinary researchers \nexperience with respect to disciplinary institutions. The interviewees suggested that doing \ninterdisciplinary research may distance the researcher from their \u201ehome discipline\u201f and this \ncould pose an obstacle for their career because recognition structures are discipline-based. \nHowever, interviewees also felt rewarded by their involvement in different fields, the \nachievement of a more original type of knowledge and the belief that their research reflects \ntheir values (see also Brewer, 1999; Campbell, 2005; Chen, 1981; Forman and Markus, 2005; \nScerri, 2000). Individual researchers can overcome institutional constraints encountered when \ndoing interdisciplinary research as individuals or in groups. This empirical research shows \n15 \nexamples of how researchers have adapted their particular situations to carry out the research \nthat they considered worthwhile.  \nThe findings of this paper support the hypothesis that that interdisciplinary researchers \noperate within the horizontal interplay between disciplines because they bring the norms, \nconventions and rules of their own discipline(s) to the interdisciplinary research. At the \ninterplay disciplines may share some norms and conventions. The researchers will need to \nexplain their discipline\u201fs conventions and engage with the criticisms from other disciplines. \nFollowing their interdisciplinary research experience, interviewees pointed out some \nnecessary qualities of the interdisciplinary researcher, which can be regarded as emerging \nconventions within interdisciplinary research. The capacity to work collaboratively and an \nethos of respect for other disciplines were described as essential characteristics of \ninterdisciplinary researchers.  \nBoth the literature and the empirical data suggest that vertical interplay with other social \ninstitutions play an important role in shaping interdisciplinary research practices alongside \nhorizontal interplay (see also Hollingsworth and Hollingsworth, 2000). Although the data \nsuggests that this may not be always rewarding or effective, interviewees explain that they \ncan take advantage of alternative institutional arrangements within the state and civil society \nin order to advance their particular research objectives, for instance, by targeting specific \nfunding agencies (see also Nowotny et al., 2006; Klein, 1996; Turpin and Garret-Jones, \n2000).  \nIn summary, the results of this study suggest, in line with Bromley (2006), Mittelstra\u00df (2001) \nand Klein (1996), that the integrity of disciplinary traditions remains important for \ninterdisciplinary research, because interdisciplinary research occurs with reference to \ndisciplines. Disciplinary institutions appear to be necessary for both guaranteeing the \nfoundations of knowledge and providing a common ground for communication with \ncolleagues. The analysis suggests that at the interplay between disciplines \u2013 with disciplinary \ninstitutions serving as reference points - interdisciplinary researchers have the freedom to \nchallenge the conventions of their own discipline and produce innovative research.  \nSome interviewees claimed that new frameworks were needed to understand interdisciplinary \nresearch. Some of them went further to defend that interdisciplinary research should transcend \nmore traditional disciplinary research. This resonates with several calls for re-definition of \nmodern epistemic institutions found in the literature (e.g. Klein, 1996; Nowotny et al., 2006; \nLessard 2007). It appears that new interdisciplinary institutions are needed to provide an \nexclusive space for interdisciplinary research. Klein (2000) explains that once the \nrequirements of interdisciplinarity are formalised, new institutions move from the margins to \nthe centre and become, de facto, a new institutionalised hybrid discipline (Klein, 2000). This \nsuggests that formalisation would displace interdisciplinarity from the interplay between \ninstitutions. The hypothesis that emerges is that the formalisation of interdisciplinary research \nmay compromise its capacity to challenge current states of affairs and generate critical \nexperimental spaces within which knowledge related institutions can be redefined (see also de \nMey, 2000). \nThe results suggest that there is a fruitful interaction between disciplines and interdisciplinary \nresearch. Thus, it appears that policies establishing formal norms to regulate or facilitate \ninterdisciplinary research could be unproductive if they lead to the demise of interplay among \ndisciplines. On the other hand, interdisciplinary research appears to have an important role to \nplay in challenging disciplinary institutions. The results of this research suggest that \n16 \ninterdisciplinary research may help challenging disciplinary boundaries and questioning the \nfoundations of each discipline.  \nThe results of this research need to be treated with caution because they are based upon \nexploratory research among nine researchers. The research shows that the institutional \napproach is a valid perspective to study disciplines and interdisciplinary research. Further \nempirical research could contribute to explain the role of disciplinary institutions in shaping \nresearch practices. \nReferences  \nAram, J.D., 2004.

Since March \n2005 she has been working in the EC project RECOAL (INCO-WBC-1-509173) where she \nhas carried out social research to develop participatory solutions to coal ash disposal and \npollution in the western Balkans. Vanesa completed a Forestry Engineering degree at the \nPolytechnic University of Madrid (Spain) and an MSc in Environmental Policy at \nWageningen University (The Netherlands). \n  \nMaya Gislason is a DPhil Research Student undertaking research on the development of \nintegrated public health responses to newly-emerging infectious diseases in the United \nKingdom.  Particular attention is given to EcoHealth - an emerging field of study that \nintegrates ecosystem management and nature conservation with human and animal health. \nThe themes in this doctoral research are borne of interests identified during her Master's \nresearch undertaken at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada. Maya\u201fs work \nis funded by scholarships from the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan and the \nSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. \n \nMelf-Hinrich Ehlers studied agricultural sciences in Germany and the UK. After completing \nan MSc in Ecological Economics at the University of Edinburgh, he started his PhD at the \nDivision of Resource Economics at Humboldt Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin. In his research he applies \ninstitutional economics to the diffusion process of bioenergy from agricultural resources in \nGermany. He is particularly interested in relationships between institutions, technologies and \nnatural resource use. For two years he worked part-time as a consultant in the field of \nenvironmental policy. His research is funded through a scholarship from the Federal State of \nBerlin. \nAcknowledgements  \n \nThis paper was elaborated thanks to the authors' participation in the summer school \n\u201cInstitutional Analysis of Sustainability Problems\u201d part of the Marie Curie series \u201cEmerging \nTheories and Methods in Sustainability Research (THEMES)\u201d.
