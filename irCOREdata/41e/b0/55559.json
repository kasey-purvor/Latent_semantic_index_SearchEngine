Table 2 shows the heterogeneity statistics for risk differences as well as for risk ratios. Six trials with no deaths in either treatment group do not contribute information on risk ratios, but they all provide estimates of risk differences. Using P values to decide which scale is more consistent with the data 21 is inappropriate because of the differing numbers of studies. I 2 values may validly be compared and show that the risk differences are less homogeneous, as is often the case. 22 Clinically important subgroups I 2 can also be used to describe heterogeneity among subgroups. Table 2 includes results for the outcome of recurrence in the meta-analysis of trials of tamoxifen for women with early breast cancer. There was highly significant (P = 0.00002) and important heterogeneity (I 2 = 50%) among the trials. 16 However, a potentially important source of heterogeneity is the duration of treatment. The authors divided the trials into three duration categories and presented an overall heterogeneity test, a test comparing the three subgroups, and a test for heterogeneity within the subgroups. I 2 values corresponding to each test show that 96% of the variability observed among the three subgroups cannot be explained by chance. This is not clear from the P values alone. The extreme inconsistency among all 55 trials in the odds ratios for recurrence (I 2 = 50%) is substantially reduced (I 2 = 13%) once differences in treatment duration are accounted for. How much is too much heterogeneity? A naive categorisation of values for I 2 would not be appropriate for all circumstances, although we would tentatively assign adjectives of low, moderate, and high to I 2 values of 25%, 50%, and 75%. Figure 2 shows that about a quarter of meta-analyses have I 2 values over 50%. Quantification of heterogeneity is only one component of a wider investigation of variability across studies, the most important being diversity in clinical and methodological aspects. Meta-analysts must also consider the clinical implications of the observed degree of inconsistency across studies. For example, interpretation of a given degree of heterogeneity across several studies will differ according to whether the estimates show the same direction of effect.

What does this new quantity mean, and why is\nassessment of heterogeneity so important to clinical practice?\nSystematic reviews and meta-analyses can provide\nconvincing and reliable evidence relevant to many\naspects of medicine and health care.1 Their value is\nespecially clear when the results of the studies they\ninclude show clinically important effects of similar\nmagnitude. However, the conclusions are less clear\nwhen the included studies have differing results. In an\nattempt to establish whether studies are consistent,\nreports of meta-analyses commonly present a statisti-\ncal test of heterogeneity. The test seeks to determine\nwhether there are genuine differences underlying the\nresults of the studies (heterogeneity), or whether the\nvariation in findings is compatible with chance alone\n(homogeneity). However, the test is susceptible to the\nnumber of trials included in the meta-analysis.We have\ndeveloped a new quantity, I 2, which we believe gives a\nbetter measure of the consistency between trials in a\nmeta-analysis.\nNeed for consistency\nAssessment of the consistency of effects across studies\nis an essential part of meta-analysis. Unless we know\nhow consistent the results of studies are, we cannot\ndetermine the generalisability of the findings of the\nmeta-analysis. Indeed, several hierarchical systems for\ngrading evidence state that the results of studies must\nbe consistent or homogeneous to obtain the highest\ngrading.2\u20134\nTests for heterogeneity are commonly used to\ndecide on methods for combining studies and for con-\ncluding consistency or inconsistency of findings.5 6 But\nwhat does the test achieve in practice, and how should\nthe resulting P values be interpreted?\nTesting for heterogeneity\nA test for heterogeneity examines the null hypothesis\nthat all studies are evaluating the same effect. The usual\ntest statistic (Cochran\u2019s Q) is computed by summing the\nsquared deviations of each study\u2019s estimate from the\noverall meta-analytic estimate, weighting each study\u2019s\ncontribution in the same manner as in the meta-\nanalysis.7 P values are obtained by comparing the\nstatistic with a \u00012 distribution with k\u22121 degrees of\nfreedom (where k is the number of studies).\nThe test is known to be poor at detecting true\nheterogeneity among studies as significant. Meta-\nanalyses often include small numbers of studies,6 8 and\nthe power of the test in such circumstances is low.9 10\nFor example, consider the meta-analysis of ran-\ndomised controlled trials of amantadine for preventing\ninfluenza (fig 1).11 The treatment effects in the eight\ntrials seem inconsistent: the reduction in odds vary\nfrom 16% to 93%, with some of the confidence\nintervals not overlapping. But the test of heterogeneity\nyields a P value of 0.09, conventionally interpreted as\nbeing non-significant. Because the test is poor at\ndetecting true heterogeneity, a non-significant result\ncannot be taken as evidence of homogeneity. Using a\ncut-off of 10% for significance12 ameliorates this prob-\nlem but increases the risk of drawing a false positive\nconclusion (type I error).10\nConversely, the test arguably has excessive power\nwhen there are many studies, especially when those\nstudies are large. One of the largest meta-analyses in\nthe Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews is of clinical\ntrials of tricyclic antidepressants and selective sero-\ntonin reuptake inhibitors for treatment of depres-\nsion.13 Over 15 000 participants from 135 trials are\nincluded in the assessment of comparative drop-out\nrates, and the test for heterogeneity is significant\n(P = 0.005). However, this P value does not reasonably\ndescribe the extent of heterogeneity in the results of\nthe trials. As we show later, a little inconsistency exists\namong these trials but it does not affect the conclusion\nof the review (that serotonin reuptake inhibitors have\nlower discontinuation rates than tricyclic anti-\ndepressants).\nSince systematic reviews bring together studies that\nare diverse both clinically and methodologically,\nheterogeneity in their results is to be expected.6 For\nexample, heterogeneity is likely to arise through diver-\nsity in doses, lengths of follow up, study quality, and\ninclusion criteria for participants. So there seems little\npoint in simply testing for heterogeneity when what\nmatters is the extent to which it affects the conclusions\nof the meta-analysis.\nOker-Blom (1970)\nMuldoon (1976)\nMonto (1979)\nKantor (1980)\nPettersson (1980)\nQuarles (1981)\nDolin (1982)\nReuman (1989)\nOdds ratio=0.34 (95% CI=0.22 to 0.53)\nHeterogeneity: Q=12.4, P=0.09\nTrial\n16\/141\n1\/53\n8\/136\n9\/59\n32\/95\n15\/107\n2\/113\n3\/317\nDrug\n(n\/N)\n41\/152\n8\/52\n28\/139\n9\/51\n59\/97\n20\/99\n27\/132\n5\/159\n0.10.01 1 10 100\nOdds ratio\nIncreased riskDecreased risk\nPlacebo\n(n\/N)\nOdds ratio\n(95% CI)\nFig 1 Eight trials of amantadine for prevention of influenza.11\nOutcome is cases of influenza.

I 2 can be readily calculated\nfrom basic results obtained from a typical meta-\nanalysis as I 2 = 100%\u00d7(Q \u2212 df)\/Q, where Q is Cochran\u2019s\nheterogeneity statistic and df the degrees of freedom.\nNegative values of I 2 are put equal to zero so that I 2 lies\nbetween 0% and 100%. A value of 0% indicates no\nobserved heterogeneity, and larger values show\nincreasing heterogeneity.\nExamples of values of I 2\nThe principal advantage of I 2 is that it can be calculated\nand compared across meta-analyses of different sizes,\nof different types of study, and using different types of\noutcome data. Table 1 gives I 2 values for six published\nmeta-analyses along with 95% uncertainty intervals.\nThe upper limits of these intervals show that\nconclusions of homogeneity in meta-analyses of small\nnumbers of studies are often unjustified.11 13 15\u201319\nThe tamoxifen and streptokinase meta-analyses, in\nwhich all the included studies found similar effects,16 17\nhave I 2 values of 3% and 19% respectively. These indi-\ncate little variability between studies that cannot be\nexplained by chance. For the review comparing\ndrop-outs on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\nwith tricyclic antidepressants, I 2 is 26%, indicating that\nalthough the heterogeneity is highly significant, it is a\nsmall effect.\nThe reviews of trials of magnesium after myocar-\ndial infarction (I 2 = 63%) and case-control studies\ninvestigating the effects of electromagnetic radiation\non leukaemia (69%) both included studies with diverse\nresults. The high I 2 values show that most of the\nvariability across studies is due to heterogeneity rather\nthan chance. Although no significant heterogeneity\nwas detected in the review of amantadine,11 the incon-\nsistency was moderately large (I 2 = 44%).\nFigure 2 shows the observed values of I 2 from 509\nmeta-analyses in the Cochrane Database of Systematic\nReviews. Almost half of these meta-analyses (250) had no\ninconsistency (I 2 = 0%). Among meta-analyses with\nsome heterogeneity, the distribution of I 2 is roughly flat.\nFurther applications of I 2\nI 2 can also be helpful in investigating the causes and\ntype of heterogeneity, as in the three examples below.\nMethodological subgroups\nFigure 3 shows the six case-control studies of magnetic\nfields and leukaemia broken down into two subgroups\nbased on assessment of their quality.19 If heterogeneity\nis identified in a meta-analysis a common option is to\nsubgroup the studies. Because of loss of power,\nnon-significant heterogeneity within a subgroup may\nbe due not to homogeneity but to the smaller number\nof studies. Here, the P values for the heterogeneity test\nare higher for the two subgroups (P = 0.3 and\nP = 0.009) than for the complete data (P = 0.007),\nwhich suggests greater consistency within the sub-\ngroups. However, the values of I 2 show that the three\nlow quality studies are more inconsistent (I 2 = 79%)\nthan all six (I 2 = 69%) (table 2). Substantially less incon-\nsistency exists among the high quality studies (I 2\n= 15%), although uncertainty intervals for all of the I2\nvalues are wide.\nTable 1 Heterogeneity statistics for examples of meta-analyses from the literature.

Table 2 shows the hetero-\ngeneity statistics for risk differences as well as for risk\nratios. Six trials with no deaths in either treatment\ngroup do not contribute information on risk ratios, but\nthey all provide estimates of risk differences. Using P\nvalues to decide which scale is more consistent with the\ndata21 is inappropriate because of the differing\nnumbers of studies. I 2 values may validly be compared\nand show that the risk differences are less homogene-\nous, as is often the case.22\nClinically important subgroups\nI 2 can also be used to describe heterogeneity among\nsubgroups. Table 2 includes results for the outcome of\nrecurrence in the meta-analysis of trials of tamoxifen\nfor women with early breast cancer. There was highly\nsignificant (P = 0.00002) and important heterogeneity\n(I 2 = 50%) among the trials.16 However, a potentially\nimportant source of heterogeneity is the duration of\ntreatment. The authors divided the trials into three\nduration categories and presented an overall hetero-\ngeneity test, a test comparing the three subgroups, and\na test for heterogeneity within the subgroups. I 2 values\ncorresponding to each test show that 96% of the\nvariability observed among the three subgroups\ncannot be explained by chance. This is not clear from\nthe P values alone. The extreme inconsistency among\nall 55 trials in the odds ratios for recurrence (I 2 = 50%)\nis substantially reduced (I 2 = 13%) once differences in\ntreatment duration are accounted for.\nHow much is too much heterogeneity?\nA naive categorisation of values for I 2 would not be\nappropriate for all circumstances, although we would\ntentatively assign adjectives of low, moderate, and high\nto I 2 values of 25%, 50%, and 75%. Figure 2 shows that\nabout a quarter of meta-analyses have I 2 values over\n50%. Quantification of heterogeneity is only one com-\nponent of a wider investigation of variability across\nstudies, the most important being diversity in clinical\nand methodological aspects. Meta-analysts must also\nconsider the clinical implications of the observed\ndegree of inconsistency across studies. For example,\ninterpretation of a given degree of heterogeneity\nacross several studies will differ according to whether\nthe estimates show the same direction of effect.\nAdvantages of I 2\n\u2022 Focuses attention on the effect of any heterogeneity\non the meta-analysis\n\u2022 Interpretation is intuitive\u2014the percentage of total\nvariation across studies due to heterogeneity\n\u2022 Can be accompanied by an uncertainty interval\n\u2022 Simple to calculate and can usually be derived from\npublished meta-analyses\n\u2022 Does not inherently depend on the number of\nstudies in the meta-analysis\n\u2022 May be interpreted similarly irrespective of the type\nof outcome data (eg dichotomous, quantitative, or time\nto event) and choice of effect measure (eg odds ratio\nor hazard ratio)\n\u2022 Wide range of applications\nHigh quality studies\n  Savitz et al (1988)\n  Petridou et al (1997)\n  Linet et al (1997)\nOdds ratio=1.15 (95% CI=0.85 to 1.55)\nHeterogeneity: Q=2.4, P=0.3\nStudy\n27\/97\n11\/117\n111\/402\nExposed\n(n\/N)\n52\/259\n14\/202\n113\/402\nLow quality studies\n  Wertheimer et al (1979)\n  Fulton et al (1980)\n  London et al (1991)\nOdds ratio=1.72 (95% CI=1.01 to 2.93)\nHeterogeneity: Q=9.4, P=0.009\nAll studies\nOdds ratio=1.46 (95% CI=1.05 to 2.04)\nHeterogeneity: Q=15.9, P=0.007\n63\/155\n103\/198\n122\/211\n29\/155\n112\/225\n92\/205\n0.1 1 10\nOdds ratio\nIncreased riskDecreased risk\nControl\n(n\/N)\nOdds ratio\n(95% CI)\nFig 3 Meta-analyses of six case-control studies relating residential\nexposure to electromagnetic fields to childhood leukaemia.19\nSummary odds ratio calculated by random effects method\nTable 2 More advanced applications of I 2 for assessing heterogeneity in three published meta-analyses.

We believe, I 2 offers advantages over exist-\ning approaches to the assessment of heterogeneity\n(box). Focusing on the effect of heterogeneity also\navoids the temptation to perform so called two stage\nanalyses, in which the meta-analysis strategy (fixed or\nrandom effects method) is determined by the result of\na statistical test. Such strategies have been found to be\nproblematic.23 24 We therefore believe that I 2 is\npreferable to the test of heterogeneity when assessing\ninconsistency across studies.\nWe thank Keith O\u2019Rourke and Ian White for useful comments.\nContributors: The authors all work as statisticians and have\nextensive experience in methodological, empirical and applied\nresearch in meta-analysis.

Having originated merely with an\nattempt to cure or alleviate a disease which afflicts every race of\nmankind, it has directed attention to the physical and social\nconditions which lead to it, and clearly indicates the direction in\nwhich reform is urgently needed if deterioration of the physique\nof modern urban communities is to be arrested.\nWhat, then, is this great discovery embodied in the open-air\ntreatment of consumption? Absurd as it may sound, it is nothing\nbut the rediscovery of the vis medicatrix Naturae and of the value\nof unpolluted air. That the body possesses a certain power of\nrecovering from illness and repairing wounds, and that pure air is\nbeneficial to health, have always been familiar facts; but familiar\nfacts are just those which are most constantly disregarded in\npractice. It is one of the great merits of the open-air treatment of\nconsumption that it is rapidly popularizing the conception that\npolluted air is as much to be avoided as polluted water. More\nimportant still, has been the effect of the open-air treatment in\nrefuting deeply-rooted superstitions as to the evil effects of\nexposure to atmospheric changes, and in directing attention to\nthe real enemy\u2014namely, dust and dirt, especially the organic dirt\nwhich emanates from the animal body.\nThere can be no great progress in public health until all classes\nrecognize that the first essential of health is minute cleanliness of\nbody, raiment, food, and dwelling-house. How far we are from this\nideal, even among the well-to-do classes, every doctor knows.\n(BMJ 1903;ii:986)\nEducation and debate\n560 BMJ VOLUME 327 6 SEPTEMBER 2003 bmj.com\n on 5 May 2009 bmj.comDownloaded from \n"}
