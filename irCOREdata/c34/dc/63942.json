Both water and fish were sampled at intervals and steroid concentrations in 29 \nboth compartments were determined. The plasma steroid time profile revealed a 30 \nrapid bioconcentration within the first 6 hours of exposure. The plasma steroid levels 31 \nattained at this time point (20 \u2013 90 ng ml-1) were up to 50-fold (E2) and 200-fold (T) 32 \ngreater than the actual levels of steroid measured in the exposure water, while levels 33 \nin the blood of control fish did not exceed 4 ng ml-1. The substantial elevation of 34 \nplasma steroid levels relative to the concentrations of steroid to which the fish were 35 \nexposed in the ambient water gives scope for delivery of the steroids to target 36 \nendocrine tissues at levels far in excess of what might be predicted on the basis of 37 \npassive branchial uptake alone. These results are discussed in relation to endocrine 38 \ndisruption, and in particular the occurrence of effects in fish exposed to levels of  39 \nendocrine active substances (EAS) that are seemingly physiologically irrelevant. 40 \n 41 \n 42 \nKeywords:   17\u00df-estradiol; testosterone; stickleback; plasma; uptake; 43 \nbioconcentration 44 \n 3 \n1. Introduction 45 \nThe exposure of fish to chemicals in solution by immersion in either static, 46 \nsemi-static, or flow-through systems is a technique routinely employed in aquatic 47 \ntoxicology. Dose response endpoint data are related to the nominal or actual 48 \nconcentrations of test chemical in the water. However, linking data obtained from in 49 \nvivo exposure systems with data from in vitro tests is difficult. This is primarily 50 \nbecause we remain largely ignorant of the dynamics of uptake and excretion of the 51 \ntest chemical by the exposed fish other than in those studies where bioaccumulation 52 \nand depuration are specifically measured (Specker & Chandlee, 2003). This absence 53 \nof information on the uptake of chemicals by test animals is particularly pertinent to 54 \nthe current interest in EASs. 55 \nA range of in vitro systems is routinely used for screening chemicals for 56 \nagonistic or antagonistic endocrine effects, exemplified by the recombinant yeast 57 \nscreen for estrogens and androgens (Routledge & Sumpter, 1996; Harris et al., 1997; 58 \nThomas et al., 2002). This system and others (Legler et al., 2002) are extremely 59 \nresponsive to chemicals possessing steroidal activity. However, it is difficult to relate 60 \nwith confidence the dose response data obtained from such a system with the likely 61 \nsensitivity of an intact animal exposed to the same chemical, or to predict the risk 62 \nposed by concentrations of the chemical in the environment. One factor contributing 63 \nto this uncertainty is lack of information relating environmental concentrations to 64 \nlevels in the blood of exposed organisms. In two British rivers in which fish are 65 \nshowing estrogenic effects (Nene and Lea), environmental levels of E2 have been 66 \nshown to be in the range 0.4 - 4 ng l-1 (Williams et al., 2003), though they may be 67 \nfurther diluted or concentrated by changeable river flows or inputs downstream of 68 \nsewage works. Despite these exposure concentrations being at levels which appear 69 \n 4 \nto be physiologically irrelevant, numerous effects linked to the activity of E2 and other 70 \nestrogenic chemicals have been widely reported from these and other rivers (Jobling 71 \net al., 1998; van Aerle et al., 2001; Kirby et al., 2004). 72 \nThe aim of this study was to provide an insight into the relationship between 73 \nthe concentration of steroid hormone in the water within which the fish is immersed, 74 \nand the concentration of this hormone in the blood. This relationship was investigated 75 \nover a 6 day period, making the assumptions for functional purposes that the blood 76 \nconcentration equates to that delivered to the target tissues and that no significant 77 \nchanges in internal steroid metabolism were induced by the hormone exposure. 78 \nA static exposure system utilising the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus 79 \naculeatus) was adopted. The biology of the stickleback is well described (Wootton, 80 \n1976; Wootton, 1984; Bell & Foster, 1994) and this species is widely used in 81 \nbehavioural, ecological, physiological and toxicological studies. In the context of 82 \nendocrine disruption, the stickleback represents a test species with three distinct 83 \nendpoints of relevance: a range of endocrine-dependent behaviours (Bell, 2001), the 84 \nestrogen sensitive biomarker vitellogenin (VTG; (Katsiadaki et al., 2002b; Hahlbeck 85 \net al., 2004), and a unique androgen sensitive endpoint, the nest building glue, 86 \nspiggin (Jones et al., 2001; Katsiadaki et al., 2002a). Use of the stickleback in studies 87 \nof endocrine active substances is increasingly widespread. In this study, the fish 88 \nwere exposed to two natural steroids, testosterone and 17\u00df-estradiol, both singly and 89 \nin combination, and concentrations of these steroids were determined in the water, 90 \nand blood plasma. 91 \n 92 \n 93 \n 94 \n 5 \n2. Materials and methods 95 \n 96 \n2.1 Experimental fish 97 \nSticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) were obtained from a commercial 98 \nsupplier (Moore and Moore, Reading) and held in groups of 200 fish in each of four 99 \n1000 litre circular outdoor tanks supplied with a constant flow of Windermere lake 100 \nwater (10 l min-1) and natural photoperiod and temperature range (4oC \u2013 17oC 101 \nannually). During the summer of 2002 the fish were sexed by external inspection and 102 \nthen held in single sex groups until the time of study, during December 2002. At this 103 \ntime, water temperature was 11oC, pH was within the range 6.5 to 7.2, hardness 110 104 \n- 140 mg l-1 CaCO3, and dissolved O2 91-98% saturation.  The fish were fed three 105 \ntimes weekly on commercial trout feed (Skretting fry crumb 02). At the time of the 106 \nstudy the average size of the fish was (mean \u00b1 SEM) 3.41 \u00b1 0.05 g, n = 144. There 107 \nwas no significant difference in mass between the male and female groups. 108 \n 109 \n2.2 Exposure system 110 \nThe experiment was carried out at 11 \u00b0C in a temperature controlled 111 \nlaboratory with an 8h light : 16h dark photoperiod. Eight 50 litre glass aquaria were 112 \nfilled with sand-filtered lake water and aerated for 48 h before the introduction of the 113 \nfish. Four groups of 21 male fish and four groups of 21 female fish were selected at 114 \nrandom from the stock ponds and transferred to the exposure aquaria. The fish were 115 \nallowed to acclimate to these conditions for one week. All fish were adults, but 116 \nreproductively quiescent, and did not display any secondary sexual characteristics. 117 \nThe fish were fed once daily with commercial trout feed 2 hours into the light period. 118 \nA 50% water change was carried out twice prior to the start of the exposure period. 119 \n 6 \nThe general health of the fish was observed to be good throughout the study, with 120 \nactive, inquisitive behaviours and no visibly evident infections or parasites. Two fish 121 \ndied during the experiment, though the mortalities were not considered to be 122 \ntreatment related. 123 \n 124 \n2.3 Dosing 125 \nStock solutions (50 mg l-1) containing testosterone or 17\u00df-estradiol (Sigma-126 \nAldrich) were made up in acetone. Four treatments were randomly applied to the four 127 \naquaria housing male fish and to the four aquaria housing female fish: (1) E2 at a 128 \nnominal concentration of 1000 ng l-1; (2) E2 and T in combination, both at nominal 129 \nconcentrations of 1000 ng l-1; (3) T at a nominal concentration of 1000 ng l-1; (4) 130 \nControl group, solvent carrier only (20 \u00b5l l-1). Steroids were introduced into the tanks 131 \nby removing 1.0 l of tank water in a beaker, adding 1 ml of stock solution containing 132 \neither E2, T or E2 and T to the beaker, and after mixing, replacing the water in the 133 \ntank (all tanks contained 0.002% acetone).  134 \n 135 \n2.4 Sampling procedures 136 \nGroups of six fish (three males and three females) were sampled at 0, 6, 24, 137 \n48, 72, & 144 hours from commencement of exposure. The fish were caught in a dip 138 \nnet and rapidly transferred to anaesthetic (2-phenoxyethanol; 1:2000) before being 139 \nkilled by cranial compression using forceps. Blood samples were obtained by 140 \nsevering the caudal peduncle and collecting blood in a heparinised capillary tube. 141 \nThe blood sample was then transferred to a capped 1.5 ml centrifuge tube and held 142 \non ice before being centrifuged. Plasma was transferred to a second, individually pre-143 \nweighed 1.5 ml tube. The tube and plasma were then weighed together to calculate 144 \n 7 \nthe volume of plasma sample obtained (assuming density of 1g ml-1; mean 26.3 \u00b5l). 145 \nSamples were stored frozen at -20oC until required for analysis. Water samples were 146 \ntaken from the middle of the aquaria by siphon at 0, 72 and 144 hours. These were 147 \ntransferred to stoppered plastic bottles and stored frozen for later analysis. 148 \n 149 \n2.5 Extraction of water samples 150 \nThe water samples, ranging from 497-677ml in volume were thawed overnight 151 \nat 4\u00baC, filtered under vacuum (Whatman GF\/C microfibre filter) and then pumped 152 \nthrough a methanol (Analar) primed Sep-Pak C18 (Waters Ltd) solid phase extraction 153 \ncartridge at 5 ml min-1. Steroids retained on the cartridge were eluted with 5 ml 154 \nmethanol. The methanol eluate was dried under nitrogen at 30\u00baC in a heating block 155 \nand the sample was redissolved in 1.0 ml of ethyl acetate (Analar), which was stored 156 \nat -20oC until required for assay. This method consistently provided recoveries of 157 \n=85% (86.5 \u00b1 0.63, n=8) when run with radiolabelled steroids and estimates of 158 \ndissolved steroid concentrations in the exposure tanks are corrected for this level of 159 \nloss. 160 \n 161 \n2.6 Steroid assays 162 \nSteroids were extracted from plasma samples with ethyl acetate (5:1, ethyl 163 \nacetate : plasma) and aliquots of plasma extracts from every fish were analysed for 164 \nboth E2 and T using previously validated radioimmunoassay procedures (Pottinger & 165 \nPickering, 1985; Pottinger & Pickering, 1990). The assay detection limit is 6 pg 166 \nsteroid per assay tube. All of the extracted water samples were also assayed for both 167 \nsteroids using the same procedures. 168 \n 169 \n 8 \n2.7 Statistical analysis 170 \nMultifactorial analysis of variance (ANOVA, Genstat 5) was employed to 171 \nassess the significance of changes in steroid levels in steroid-exposed and control 172 \ngroups with time and between sexes. Where mean and variance did not vary 173 \nindependently, as indicated by a plot of residuals against fitted values, a log 174 \ntransformation was applied to improve the homogeneity of variance. Significant 175 \ndifferences between treatment groups, times, or sexes were determined using the 176 \nestimated standard error of the differences between means. Where no overall 177 \nsignificant difference was found (P>0.05) between the male and female response, 178 \ntheir data were combined.  179 \n  180 \n3. Results 181 \n3.1 Concentrations of steroid in the exposure water 182 \nThe concentrations of E2 in the exposure tanks are depicted in Table I. In 183 \ncontrol tanks, receiving vehicle only, concentrations of E2 were very low ranging from  184 \nnot detectable to 8.4 ng l-1. In the four tanks receiving E2 only or a combination of E2 185 \nand T, maximum levels of E2 (50% to 80% of nominal concentration) were detected 186 \nat 6 h. In both sets of tanks there was a progressive decline in the concentration of 187 \nE2 during the course of the study and this was most pronounced in the tanks 188 \nreceiving both E2 and T, such that at 144 h after the start of the study, concentrations 189 \nhad declined to between 2.5% to 34% of the nominal. The concentration of T in the 190 \ncontrol tanks was also very low (= 5 ng l-1; Table II) but, in contrast to E2, water-191 \nborne T concentrations declined from approximately 400 ng l-1 (40% to 50% of the 192 \nnominal value) to control levels within 72 h of the start of the study in both the T-only 193 \n 9 \nand combined T and E2 exposure tanks. Overall, there was good agreement in the 194 \nwater chemistry between the duplicate tanks containing male and female fish.  195 \n 196 \n3.2 Plasma steroid concentrations: E2 197 \nPlasma E2 levels are presented in Fig. 1. There was no significant difference 198 \nbetween E2 levels in male and female controls (consistently <0.5 ng ml-1), so these 199 \nwere combined. In fish from both treatment groups (E2 and E2 + T), plasma E2 200 \nconcentrations were significantly greater than those in the control fish (P<0.001) 201 \nthroughout. There was no significant difference in the plasma E2 levels between 202 \nmales and females exposed to E2 alone and these data were therefore also 203 \ncombined (Fig. 1a). There was a rapid increase in plasma E2 levels in these fish 204 \nwithin 6 h of the start of the exposure period, with mean plasma E2 levels rising from 205 \n0.8 \u00b1 0.2 ng ml-1 at 0 h to 22.3 \u00b1 5.3 ng ml-1. Plasma levels of E2 were maintained at 206 \nor around this level throughout the study, remaining significantly elevated at 17.9 \u00b1 207 \n4.2 ng ml-1 at 144 h. Plasma levels of E2 in fish from the combined E2 and T 208 \nexposure tanks showed a similar pattern (Fig. 1b). However, in this case, there was a 209 \ndifference in plasma E2 levels between the sexes, with levels in male fish being 210 \nsignificantly greater overall than levels in female fish. Plasma E2 levels in both sexes 211 \nrose rapidly after the start of the exposure period to reach maximum levels at 6 h 212 \n(males: 39.9 \u00b1 10 ng ml-1; females: 31.4 \u00b1 6 ng ml-1), after which there was a decline 213 \nto approximately 12 ng ml-1 at the end of the study.  Mean plasma E2 levels in fish 214 \nexposed to T alone were significantly (P<0.001) higher than control levels (Fig. 1c) at 215 \n0, 6, 24 and 144 h, although they did not exceed 10 ng ml-1 at any time.  Male plasma 216 \ncontained significantly more E2 than females only at 24 h. 217 \n 218 \n 10 \n3.3 Plasma steroid concentrations: T 219 \nIn fish exposed to T alone, male and female plasma T levels were statistically 220 \ndistinct from each other and are plotted separately. Both sexes however did display 221 \nthe same general trend of a rapid and pronounced increase in plasma T levels within 222 \n6 h of the start of the exposure (female: 25.1 \u00b1 7.1 ng ml-1; male: 17.8 \u00b1 3.5 ng ml-1), 223 \nfollowed by a relatively rapid return to pre-exposure levels within 48h (Fig. 2a). A 224 \nsimilar temporal pattern was observed in plasma T levels in fish exposed to a 225 \ncombination of E2 and T (Fig. 2b), although in this case maximum levels achieved 226 \nwere considerably higher, ranging from 1.1 \u00b1 0.4 ng ml-1 at 0 h to 87.7 \u00b1 18 ng ml-1 227 \nwithin 6 h of the start of the exposure. T levels in males and females exposed to T 228 \nalone only differed significantly at 24 and 48 h. Mean plasma T concentrations in 229 \nmale and female fish exposed to E2 only were low, remaining below 4 ng ml-1 230 \nthroughout the study (Fig. 2c). 231 \n 232 \n4. Discussion 233 \nThe concentrations of steroids in the exposure system changed markedly with time; 234 \nan effect that was most pronounced in the case of T. Factors likely to have reduced 235 \nthe concentration of dissolved steroids in the static exposure system include the 236 \nuptake of steroids by the experimental fish, biodegradation by water borne bacteria 237 \nand adsorption to surfaces of the exposure vessel. These issues have been 238 \ndiscussed elsewhere (Nimrod & Benson, 1998; Jurgens et al., 2002; Kiparissis et al., 239 \n2003). In this instance, the rate of disappearance of T in both single exposure (T 240 \nonly) and dual exposure (T + E2) tanks was much higher than the rate of 241 \ndisappearance of E2. The initial concentrations (at 6 h) of T achieved in both systems 242 \nwere similar to the concentrations of E2 measured in E2-dosed tanks at the same 243 \n 11 \ntime. However, substantial concentrations of E2 were detected in water throughout 244 \nthe course of the study, suggesting that the rapid loss of T from the tanks in which it 245 \nwas administered was a phenomenon specific to this steroid. Given the broadly 246 \nsimilar physicochemical characteristics of the two steroids, and that no evidence to 247 \nthe contrary can be found,  differences in the adsorption of T and E2 seem unlikely. It 248 \nis therefore suspected that either differential metabolism by micro organisms, or 249 \ndifferences in the uptake and metabolism of the two steroids by the fish themselves 250 \nmust account for the disparities. While previous reports suggest that differences in 251 \nthe rate of uptake of steroids by fish may exist (Piferrer & Donaldson, 1994), these 252 \ndata are not entirely consistent with the results of the present study. In terms of 253 \nmetabolism, the rapid reduction of plasma T levels compared to plasma E2 levels 254 \nmay in part be attributed to the aromatisation of androgens to estrogens (Borg et al., 255 \n1987; Andersson et al., 1988; Afonso et al., 1999) but could equally reflect the 256 \nreduced availability of T in the surrounding water. 257 \n 258 \nAnalysis of T and E2 levels in the blood of the exposed fish revealed that there was a 259 \nrapid uptake of steroids from the water. The excellent gas transfer properties of fish 260 \ngills facilitate the movement of chemicals from the water to the blood and the speed 261 \nat which this occurs depends upon a number of factors such as respiration rate, 262 \nlamellar recruitment, and the physicochemical properties of the compound (Randall 263 \net al., 1996). Steroids are moderately lipophilic molecules (log KOW of E2 and T are 264 \n4.01 and 3.32 respectively (Hansch et al., 1995)) which have a high transfer capacity 265 \nthrough the gill epithelium and it is therefore unsurprising that blood levels of T and 266 \nE2 in the exposed sticklebacks were markedly elevated within 6 h of the start of the 267 \nexposure period. However, the concentrations of steroid measured in the blood of the 268 \n 12 \nexposed fish at this time far exceeded levels that might have been predicted on the 269 \nbasis of passive diffusion across the gill epithelium. Others authors have shown that 270 \nfor a system at equilibrium, expected plasma concentrations of a chemical can be 271 \ncalculated from the associated log KOW value and concentration in the exposure 272 \nwater (Huggett et al., 2003). The expected concentration ratio between the water and 273 \nthe blood at equilibrium, known as the blood water partition coefficient (PBW) has 274 \nbeen modelled for rainbow trout by the equation: log PBW = 0.73 log KOW \u2013 0.88 275 \n(Fitzsimmons et al., 2001), yielding PBW values of 7.74 and 4.68 for E2 and T 276 \nrespectively. As stated, these values are based on a formula constructed from data 277 \non trout at steady state, and hence are not directly related to the dynamic uptake 278 \nobserved within the first 6h here. However, they do still significantly underestimate 279 \nthe actual blood concentrations observed. 280 \n 281 \nFor both steroids, mean concentrations in the plasma of exposed sticklebacks were 282 \nwithin the range 20 \u2013 100 ng ml-1 within 6 h. This contrasts significantly with the 283 \nconcentrations of each steroid in the water within which the fish were immersed, 284 \nwhich were within the range 300 \u2013 900 ng l-1 (= 0.3-0.9 ng ml-1). When matched to 285 \ntheir respective water concentration, steroid levels within the blood of the exposed 286 \nsticklebacks were between 35 and 200-fold greater than those in the water within 6 h 287 \nof the start of the study. Plasma E2 and T levels in all the control groups were very 288 \nlow throughout the study and all the fish were reproductively inactive, so we assume 289 \nthat the increase in plasma steroid levels can be attributed wholly to uptake from the 290 \nwater.  In the case of the increase in plasma E2 during the T exposure (Fig. 1c), this 291 \nis presumably attributable to partial aromatisation of the absorbed T. It is unclear why 292 \nthe plasma levels of E2 in fish from the combined E2 and T exposure tanks (Fig. 1b) 293 \n 13 \nshowed a disparity between the sexes, with male levels significantly higher than 294 \nfemale. This may be due to sex-related differences in how the steroids are 295 \nmetabolised. 296 \n 297 \nThe exposure concentrations of E2 and T were selected to ensure measurable 298 \nconcentrations in the blood of the exposed fish with no foreknowledge of the outcome 299 \nof the study and are therefore much higher than those that occur in rivers 300 \ndownstream of sewage treatment works discharges, eg. E2 < 50 ng l-1 (Desbrow et 301 \nal., 1998). However, the plasma levels of T achieved in this study were within the 302 \nrange observed in naturally breeding sticklebacks and therefore did not represent a 303 \nsupra-physiological challenge to the fish. Pall et al., (2005) have shown that 304 \ncirculating T levels reach up to 70 ng ml-1 at their peak in males during the sexual 305 \nphase in the breeding season, declining to 8 ng ml-1 in the paternal phase. Borg et 306 \nal., (1995) report that mature females have plasma T levels of up to 24 ng ml-1, while 307 \nthe E2 plasma levels in these same fish was not detectable. Further information on 308 \nplasma E2 levels in wild sticklebacks cannot be found for comparison.  309 \n 310 \nRapid uptake of steroids from the water by fish has been reported previously in 311 \nstudies where measurements have been made on whole-body concentrations. For 312 \nexample, whole-body levels of E2 were maximal within 30 mins of the onset of 313 \nexposure in summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) exposed to water-borne E2 314 \n(Specker & Chandlee, 2003). In a more recent study, the plasma bioconcentration of 315 \ntritiated E2 and T was monitored in tench (Tinca tinca). After 6 - 7 hours, the ratio of 316 \nradioactivity in plasma compared to the surrounding water was similar to those 317 \nobserved for actual steroid in the present study (Scott et al., 2005). The phenomenon 318 \n 14 \nhas also been observed at this laboratory in chub (Leuciscus cephalus) exposed to 319 \nE2 in a flow-through system (T. G. Pottinger & N. Rajapakse, unpublished data). 320 \n 321 \nGiven the fact that the difference in concentration of steroids across the gill 322 \nepithelium cannot easily be explained by the hydrophobicity\/lipophilicity of the 323 \nchemicals, other contributing factors must be considered. It might be postulated that 324 \nactive transport of the steroids across the gill epithelium may also account for the 325 \nmaintenance of this concentration gradient but we are unaware of any reports that 326 \nsuch a mechanism exists in the fish gill. It is more likely  that the maintenance of this 327 \nhigh concentration gradient in steroid levels across the gill epithelium is related to the 328 \npresence in the blood of a sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). In seeking to 329 \nexplain similar observations of steroid uptake in T. tinca, Scott et al. (2005) 330 \ndemonstrated a clear relationship between the rate of uptake of specific steroids and 331 \ntheir relative affinity for native tench SHBG. Although it is the case that a SHBG has 332 \nnot yet been identified in the three-spined stickleback, the presence of SHBGs in the 333 \nblood of other teleost fish is well-documented (Pottinger, 1988; Pottinger & Pickering, 334 \n1990; Laidley & Thomas, 1997; Hobby et al., 2000; Miguel-Queralt et al., 2004) and it 335 \nis therefore reasonable to assume that the stickleback also possesses a homologous 336 \nsteroid-binding protein. SHBGs are assumed to perform a transport\/protective role for 337 \nsteroids (Rosner, 1990) and in fish are characterised by high affinity for both 338 \nandrogens and estrogens (Ovrevik et al., 2001) and a moderately high binding 339 \ncapacity (Pottinger, 1988). It has been shown that >95% of circulating gonadal 340 \nsteroids in fish is protein bound (Freeman & Idler, 1971). 341 \n 342 \n 15 \nThe functional implications of these findings may be of some significance to the 343 \ninterpretation of the mode of action of environmental estrogens and androgens and 344 \ntheir mimics. These data suggest that steroidal estrogens and androgens dispersed 345 \nin the aquatic environment, that are capable of binding to SHBGs, may be delivered 346 \nto target tissues at a concentration far in excess of that to which the fish is exposed. 347 \nIt has been demonstrated that in addition to the native ligands, T and E2, certain 348 \nendocrine active substances also bind to teleost SHBG. In rainbow trout plasma, 349 \nethynylestradiol, diethylstilbestrol, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, genistein, zearalenone, 4-t-350 \noctylphenol, bisphenol A and o,p'-DDT all compete for binding sites with E2, although 351 \nwith varying efficacy (Tollefsen, 2002), and the SHBG may therefore play a role in 352 \npotentiating the activity of these estrogenic chemicals.  It has also been shown that 353 \nthe binding properties of SHBG may be modulated by exposure in the field to 354 \nconstituents of endocrine active effluents (Pryce-Hobby et al., 2003),  a factor which 355 \nmay further disrupt normal endocrine function. 356 \n 357 \nThese findings confirm previous speculation concerning the mechanism underlying 358 \nVTG induction in fish exposed to very low levels of an estrogen, eg significant VTG 359 \nelevation in several species following exposure to estrone, E2, or 17a-ethinyl 360 \nestradiol (Purdom et al., 1994; Panter et al., 1998; Rose et al., 2002; Thorpe et al., 361 \n2003). In summary the uptake of endocrine active substances from the aquatic 362 \nenvironment by three-spined sticklebacks may be bioconcentrated in the blood, 363 \nresulting in the delivery of higher than predicted levels of such chemicals to target 364 \ntissues. 365 \n 366 \n 367 \n 16 \nAcknowledgements 368 \nR.J.M was supported by a CEH NERC studentship. 369 \n 370 \nReferences 371 \n \nAfonso, L.
