Their primary purpose is to support\nacademic study and research on European\nintegration.\nEDCs are located across all EU member\nstates, as well as in \u2018candidate countries\u2019 such\nas Croatia and Turkey. The UK is very well\nserved, with over 40 EDCs, which means that\nwherever you are, there is likely to be an\nextensive collection and librarians who can\nprovide specialist assistance in locating official\nmaterial (whether online or in print) covering\nthe whole history of the EU. EDCs are likely to\nbe based in a university or research institution\nwhere research into European integration and\nother social science fields takes place. The\nBodleian Law Library and the London School\nof Economics have been receiving official EU materials\nsince 1963, so we and many other EDCs in the UK have\ncollections spanning 30 or 40 years. The official collec-\ntions are complemented by the research publications,\ntextbooks, monographs and journals that each of the\nlibraries also holds.\nHaving EDC status means that the institution and the\nEuropean Commission have an agreement that, in return\nfor provision of free materials, the host institution\nappoints a member of staff to manage the collection; the\ncollections will be catalogued and stored and specialist\nhelp will be provided in locating information for those\nwithin the host institution and the local area. (In the past,\nthis also included free access to online databases such as\nCELEX but this is no longer necessary with the\ndevelopment of the web content of Europa1,\nEurostat2 and EUR-Lex3).\nCollections\nMost research libraries house the EDC in a dis-\ncrete collection with their own arrangement\nand classification scheme. Typically, guidance to\nthe collections is provided on the web. All\nEDCs will hold the following types of materials:\n\u2022 Primary legislation (treaties) and secondary\nlegislation (e.g. directives, regulations,\npublished in the Official Journal)\n\u2022 Proposals for new legislation\n\u2022 Documents generated during the legislative\nprocess, e.g. European Parliament debates\nand reports\n\u2022 Case law of the European Court of Justice\n\u2022 Commission (COM) documents\n\u2022 Statistical material from Eurostat\n\u2022 Overviews and explanations of policy and reports\nfrom the various EU institutions\n\u2022 Journals (e.g. Bulletin of the European Union)\nMaterial is held in a variety of formats: paper, microfiche,\nCD-ROM and now online. For example, European\nParliament Reports moved from print in 1989 to micro-\nfiche to web only in 1998. Legal materials such as the\nEuropean Court Reports (ECR) are still retained in print as\nan essential source for European law studies. Increasingly\nin an EU of 27 members, publishing of print materials in\nall official languages has reduced in preference for online\npublishing on Europa. (A similar situation exists in\nMargaret Watson\nMaria Bell\n104\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 18 Mar 2014 IP address: 158.143.197.122\npublishing from other inter-governmental organisations\nand national governments.)\nWho is using European\nDocumentation Centres?\nOur students and academics, of course, and local exter-\nnal students from a wide range of subject areas. At LSE,\nMasters students from another university\u2019s European\nstudies programme are also provided with an induction\nto using the EDC. Social science researchers require stat-\nistical data such as that produced by Eurostat to provide\nthe raw material for socio-economic analysis. Members\nof the public do use our services, but to a lesser extent.\nThe detail and level of the collection is not always suited\nto what is required for school students, or for someone\nlooking for information on living in another EU country.\nPublic information booklets available on the web or from\nEurope Direct4 or EPICs5 in public libraries may be more\nappropriate. Despite the extensive network of EU infor-\nmation services in the UK, it is apparent that users find it\ndifficult to know where information is to be found and\nwho is providing it. An EDC can assist in providing a\nroute to the information.\nPublic and research enquiries have lessened as users\ngo online themselves. This has certainly had advantages\nfor users and librarians alike. It is no longer typical for an\nEDC librarian to spend the day searching manually\nthrough indexes, providing photocopies and sending out\nbooklets when dealing with an EU enquiry. However,\nalthough users with internet access can be referred easily\nto relevant websites and online publications, they often\nstill want to talk to a person to clarify information or\nunderstand what they have found online and, amongst the\npersonal researchers, there is still a lack of widespread\naccess to the internet.\nEnquiries that are received from academic researchers\ncan be much more complex, as they have usually found\nthe basic materials, and so are looking to go deeper in to\na topic or need to trace documentation that is not so\neasily located (it may have been removed or has been\nless prominent on an official website) \u2013 meeting records,\nvoting details from parliament sessions, earlier versions\nof proposals.\nExamples of recent enquiries received at LSE are:\nwho are the MEPs in London; how to register a car if\nmoving to another EU country; researching the\nimplementation of MiFID in EU member states; and how\nthe EU\u2019s social policy has dealt with gender equality\nissues.\nStudents struggle with too much information in most\nsubjects, and it is no different for EU information, with\nthe added complexity of the organisation and its docu-\nmentation. It may be available online but how to locate it\namongst so much information? Europa itself has in excess\nof four million pages. Information skills training for EU\nresources (official and non-official) enables students to\nlocate the material more efficiently and with greater\nunderstanding of the content of resources.\nThe EDC\/EU specialist in a large institution is likely to\nneed to keep colleagues and academic staff up to date in\nthe same way as any other subject specialist.6 The sup-\nportive network of EU information providers is invaluable\nin our work. Our tasks are made easier by seeking\nadvice from and sharing our knowledge with colleagues,\nthrough personal contacts, email discussion lists and\nannual meetings. Keeping up-to-date with developments\nis always the challenge and in recent years, using news\nfeeds and email alerts has become a very convenient way\nto receive updates (e.g. EUfeeds7, Europe Media\nMonitor8 or EurActiv9). Invariably, enquiries will relate to\nwhat has been making the news. The European elections\nin June this year and further discussions on the ratifica-\ntion of the Treaty of Lisbon, including the possibility of a\nsecond Irish referendum, will bring EU issues in to the\nheadlines again and generate interest.\nCurrent issues\nThe key issue facing European Documentation Centres\ntoday is the challenge of how to adapt their functions,\nrole and services in response to new technologies.\nEDCs originally received one copy of every official\npublication distributed by the Office for Official\nPublications (OPOCE), but the increasing prevalence of\nelectronic distribution has resulted in the latest EDC\ncontract permitting the Publications Office sometimes to\nmeet this obligation electronically. As the university\nlibraries that host EDCs receive less in the form of phys-\nical collections, some have questioned whether EDCs\noffer a good return for the time and money invested in\nthem.\nEDCs have never been free of charge to their host\ninstitutions: the publications are free, but the commit-\nment in terms of space allocated and staff time is not.\nSome of these costs have diminished, not only because\nfewer publications are supplied, but also thanks to the\nefficiencies of modern cataloguing and serials registration\nsystems. However, it is still necessary to invest in pro-\nfessional staff, and this raises questions about the role of\nthe EDC within the host institution, and the purpose of\nan international network of increasingly \u201cvirtual\u201d EDCs.\nThe local role of the EDC is partly defined by its pos-\nition within the larger collections. Whilst some libraries\ndecide that it resides logically with other collections of\nofficial publications, others position it within a subject\narea, such as law. In the latter case, it may be invisible to\nreaders from other disciplines. In the former, it may be\ninvisible to almost everyone. This matters, even in an\nincreasingly electronic information environment, because\nreaders still need the support and assistance of pro-\nfessional librarians to make the most of the resources\navailable and to interpret them effectively.\n105\nEuropean Documentation Centres\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 18 Mar 2014 IP address: 158.143.197.122\nAn EDC is only as good as its staff. The EDC contract\nrequires the host institution to provide a professional\nlibrarian to manage it. Herein lies the value of an EDC:\nthe collection is neutral, and so is the professional staff.\nThis distinguishes EDCs from a network such as Europe\nDirect. EDCs are never outlets for propaganda and they\ndo not promote the EU. They support research into\nEuropean integration, without taking a position one way\nor the other.\nThe mass of material available on Europa is not a\nneutral collection. EU officials have not only written and\nselected material for dissemination, but have also decided\nhow to display it, making certain items more prominent\nthan others and frequently removing links to material\njudged by them to be irrelevant or unimportant. For\nexample, the positioning on EUR-Lex of the link to the\nLisbon Treaty immediately below the consolidated ver-\nsions of the Treaty on European Union sends a clear, but\narguably misleading, message about its status.10\nProfessional library staff can clarify such ambiguities, and\nthe EDC network supports research into European inte-\ngration through the impartial expertise of its library and\ninformation specialists. By applying their professional\nskills and understanding of the structure of the EU and\nits documentation, EDC librarians enable researchers to\nidentify, discover and evaluate both highly visible and\nhidden material. For example, researchers relying purely\non Europa and its associated databases would be unlikely\nto discover the Archive of European Integration,11 but\nEDCs can direct them to this and to other independent\ndocumentary sources. Likewise, an EDC librarian can\nhelp students to track the progress of cases and legis-\nlation through the databases, and draw their attention to\ncommentary in the press and academic publications that\npresents alternative views to those found in, for instance,\nthe Commission\u2019s press releases.\nTurning to the wider picture, the European\nCommission still clearly believes in the value of the EDC\nnetwork within the EU, although levels of support over\nthe years have been extremely variable, and have some-\ntimes depended on the commitment of individuals, rather\nthan the institution itself. For example, the UK EDCs\nwere particularly fortunate during the 1980s to have the\nenergetic and enthusiastic support of Giancarlo Pau, who\narrived at the London Representation in 1979. Today, the\nUK EDC network still depends heavily on the commit-\nment of a small number of individuals, who give their\ntime to manage the europe.org website, organise annual\ngeneral meetings and answer questions posted to the\neurodoc mailling list. This is essential because support\nfrom the European Commission continues to fluctuate,\npartly for financial reasons, as when the free training for\nthe networks in the UK was recently temporarily sus-\npended. It would be easier if there were more consistent\nand reliable support from the EU institutions, but EDCs\nalso derive strength from their independence. Located in\norganisations that are committed to academic freedom,\nEDCs are a source of unbiased information and advice.\nThe EDC as a physical presence may be diminishing, but\nmost EDCs have a web presence, and EDC staff use new\ntechnologies to network with each other both nationally\nand internationally.\nThe move away from paper distribution of documents\noffers both opportunities, and threats. Whilst it enables\nEDC librarians to reach wider audiences, to spend less\ntime managing physical collections and to devote more\ntime to preparing research guides, teaching and dealing\nwith enquiries, it also endangers them, if the need for\nprofessional staff is equated with the existence of sub-\nstantial holdings of books and documents. A smaller\nphysical presence can be misleading: it is simply not true\nthat everything is now available online, nor does the avail-\nability of free electronic resources reduce the need for\nskilled and knowledgeable staff to support research,\nteaching and learning.\nIt is therefore critical that universities continue to\nsupport the EDC network within their institutions, as\ncentres of expertise that enhance the quality of indepen-\ndent academic investigation.\nResources\nTo locate an EDC in the UK: http:\/\/www.europe.org.uk\/\ninfo\/\nThe European Commission Representation in the\nUnited Kingdom http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/unitedkingdom\/\nindex_en.htm\nBodleian Law Library EDC, University of Oxford\nhttp:\/\/www.ouls.ox.ac.uk\/law\/collections\/edc\nEDC, Library, London School of Economics\nhttp:\/\/www.lse.ac.uk\/library\/govpub\/euruni\/european_\nunion.htm\nFootnotes\n1http:\/\/europa.eu\n2http:\/\/epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu\/\n3http:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/\n4Europe Direct is the newest network of information centres aimed at disseminating EU information to the public. http:\/\/ec.\neuropa.eu\/europedirect\/index_en.htm\n5European Public Information Centres are an older network of information points run by UK library authorities http:\/\/ec.europa.\neu\/unitedkingdom\/information\/index_en.htm\n106\nMargaret Watson and Maria Bell\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 18 Mar 2014 IP address: 158.143.197.122\n6It is rare now for a librarian to have the EDC as their sole responsibility.

Despite the efforts of\nthe European institutions in providing information about\nEU law and policy in print and electronic media, public\nopinion research shows that it still fails to reach the\ngeneral public in most of the member states. A lack of\nfamiliarity with the legislative process or with decision-\nmaking in the EU can make it more difficult for anyone\nwithout specialist knowledge to keep up with current\ndevelopments.\nWorking documents - which relate either to develop-\nments in legislation or policy - are an essential source of\ninformation, However, a basic awareness of how things\nwork in Europe is crucial to see how they fit together.\nAs with all official publications, references are an impor-\ntant indication of where documents can be found,\nalthough in the EU they will frequently be allocated mul-\ntiple references, depending on the context, and this can\ncause confusion. It is also important to note that adminis-\ntrative processes and translation can cause considerable\ndelays in access, whilst some documents are never made\npublic.\n107\nEuropean Union\n"}
