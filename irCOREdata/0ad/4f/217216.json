INTRODUCTION \n \nIn late July 2006, the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (generally \nknown as \u201cCoRWM\u201d), which was set up by the UK government in 2003, \npublished its recommendations in Managing our Radioactive Waste Safely (1, in chapter \n9). CoRWM endorsed geological disposal as \u201cthe best available approach\u201d in \nprinciple for the long-term management of the UK\u2019s radioactive waste \u201cwithin \nthe present state of knowledge\u201d. Just three months later, Sir Nicholas (now Lord) \nStern presented his UK government-sponsored review of climate-change policy, \nThe Economics of Climate Change (2). He recommended \u201cprompt and strong action\u201d \nworldwide to deal with climate change. Both of these were high-profile exercises \nin the strategic appraisal of environmental risks and yet they took strikingly \ndifferent approaches. In this paper we ask why, and whether the differences are \njustified. Our overarching motivation for this paper is the improvement of \ndecision making in the face of such environmental risks, particularly in relation \nto the use of formal methods such as Cost Benefit or Decision Analysis. \n \n 4 \nThese strategic policy reviews are of interest as they provide a window on how \ngovernment can approach the analysis of substantive environmental risks. \nContrasting them, as we do in this paper, brings out the particular choices which \ngovernment makes in framing, and which the reviewer or review team has in \nundertaking, such reviews. In this analysis we draw on documentary evidence, \nin particular the reports themselves, but also personal experience, as both the \nauthors were involved in one or other of the reviews. The first author was a full-\ntime member of the Stern Review team in the UK Treasury, and the second \nauthor was a member of the team of consultants that facilitated CoRWM\u2019s Multi-\nCriteria Decision Analysis. Despite our personal involvement, we do \nnevertheless take a gently critical view, arguing that both of these reviews could \nprofitably have drawn on some of the tools of the other. \n \nBoth climate-change policy and radioactive waste management centrally involve \nrisk and irreversibility, in each case playing out over very long timeframes. In the \ncase of radioactive waste, the key decision is one of whether to emplace the \nwaste in a permanent geological disposal facility or leave it in temporary storage. \nThe argument for the former is that we can have sufficient confidence in the \nperformance of a suitably designed and located facility to contain the waste, and \nin any case, no better solution is likely to become available in the foreseeable \n 5 \nfuture; the argument for the latter is that this confidence is overstated, and we \nrisk losing the flexibility to respond when new information arises. In the case of \nclimate change, the key decision on emissions reductions is whether to take \naggressive action now or postpone intervention to the future. The argument for \ntaking action now is that anthropogenic climate change is irreversible, and we \nalready have enough evidence that it is real, and at least potentially catastrophic. \nThe counterargument is that investments to reduce emissions are also costly to \nreverse, that we are currently too uncertain about the benefits of such emissions \nreductions, and that we should wait until we have learned more about them.  \n \nHow best to approach policy problems involving decision under risk has been a \nsource of contention for decades. In this paper we draw on the view articulated \nby Stern and Fineberg (3) that the process for handling such problems should \ngenerally be at least to a certain extent an \u201canalytic-deliberative\u201d one (for clarity, \nwe note that the Stern of Stern and Fineberg is not the Stern of the Stern Review). \nDrawing implicitly on the thought of Habermas, Stern and Fineberg present \nanalysis and deliberation as distinct modes of approaching problems: \n \nWe use the term analysis to refer to ways of building understanding by \nsystematically applying specific theories and methods that have been \n 6 \ndeveloped within communities of expertise, such as those of the \nnatural science, social science, engineering, decision science, logic, \nmathematics, and law [disciplines] (p 97). \n \nDeliberation is any formal or informal process for communication and \nfor raising and collectively considering issues. In deliberation, people \nconfer, ponder, exchange views, consider evidence, reflect on matters \nof mutual interest, and attempt to persuade each other (p73).  \n \nStern and Fineberg argue that these modes are mutually strengthening and that \norganisations concerned with risk-related decisions should acknowledge the \nrelevance of analysis and deliberation and give conscious attention to how they \nare integrated. Stern and Fineberg also acknowledge that analysis and \ndeliberation are often closely intertwined in existing practice (for example, \nacademic peer review is a form of deliberation deployed within scientific \ndisciplines): nevertheless, their synthesis provides a basis for good practice, and \nwe see this current paper as amplifying their main themes in the context of the \nstrategic policy review. \n \n 7 \nThere were striking differences between CoRWM and Stern both in the nature of \nthe analytic techniques used (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis versus a range of \neconomic and probabilistic approaches to support Cost-Benefit Analysis), and \nalso in the form which deliberation took (broad- versus narrow-based). We ask \nthree central questions: \na) How did the reviews\u2019 approaches differ? \nb) What explanations can be given for why the reviews differed? \nc) Should the reviews have been less different, and what could they learn from \neach other? \n \nThe structure of the paper is as follows. To address question a), we outline the \ndifferences between the two reviews in Section 2. In Section 3, turning to \nquestion b), we note the choices of analytic approach and deliberative strategy \nwere linked, and explore possible reasons for these differences, in terms of (i) the \nunderpinning science, (ii) the scale of the problem and (iii) the political context of the \nreviews. The structure of these two sections is summarised in Figure 1. In Section \n4, we give our answer to the difficult question c), and then in Section 5 we \nconclude. \n \nFigure 1 about here \n 8 \n \n2. HOW DID THE REVIEWS\u2019 APPROACHES DIFFER? \n \nOn one level, CoRWM and Stern appear to have considerable similarities. Both \nwere commissioned at the highest levels of government to report on a knotty \nproblem. In both cases, the political sensitivity of the issue and its technical \ncomplexity generated a perceived need to commission senior figures with \ncredible independence from the heart of government to lead the review. Both \nwere similar in scope with budgets of a few million pounds sterling and lead-\ntimes to delivery of about two and a half and one and a half years respectively. \nNevertheless, there were substantial differences (table I). In this section we focus \non the differences in terms of analytic approach and deliberation strategy. \n \nTable I about here \n \n2.1. Analytic approach \n \nBoth reviews drew on substantial bodies of scientific evidence, although the \nrelevant scientific communities were obviously different: CoRWM had relatively \nlittle need to consult atmospheric scientists, just as Stern had for hydrogeologists. \n 9 \nSimilarly neither review was a research project in the underlying science \u2013 both \nbroadly accepted the consensus view. Both drew on analytic approaches for \nintegrating the scientific information, relating it to value-relevant outcomes, and \nultimately trading-off conflicting desiderata. However, the approaches drawn on \nto do this were quite different \u2013 Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) in the \ncase of CoRWM and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) in the case of Stern. \n \nCoRWM\u2019s approach, while technically innovative in various ways, and \nunusually ambitious in scale, is recognisable as an MCDA of a type familiar in \nthe context of environmental appraisal (e.g.4, 5-7). Roughly, CoRWM\u2019s MCDA \nworked as follows. A long list of solutions was prepared, some of which were \neliminated at an early stage to obtain a shortlist. At workshops attended \npredominantly by scientists and other experts, short-listed options were scored \non a number of different criteria. These criteria were then weighted to arrive at \noverall value scores using a \u201cswing weighting\u201d elicitation procedure (8). \n \nCriteria weights were elicited from the public and stakeholders with standard \naims of public and stakeholder consultation in mind \u2013 namely democratic \nlegitimacy, substantive insight into the decision problem, and in the hope of \nsmoothing over public opposition (9). Criteria weighting was chosen as the \n 10 \nvehicle for doing so, in order that public and stakeholder views would be \noperationally useful and focussed on the key trade-offs at hand. The Committee \nmembers themselves deliberated over criteria weighting in a series of workshops \nor \u2018Decision Conferences\u2019 (10-12). Extensive sensitivity analysis was done to explore \nwhether the recommended solutions were robust to reasonable changes in \nweights, on the basis of information garnered from the public and stakeholder \nengagement. CoRWM also made a holistic assessment of the solution options to \ntap into the Committee members\u2019 overall, disaggregate feel for how the options \nperformed. For further details the reader is referred to Chapters 10 and 11 of \nCoRWM\u2019s report and Morton, Airoldi and Phillips (9). \n \nIn Stern\u2019s case, the review team followed the standard logic of CBA, comparing \ncosts and benefits with the welfare-economic motivation of only recommending \npolicies that increase some proxy of aggregate well-being (e.g. 13). This \nconventionally involves measuring costs and benefits in money units wherever \npossible. The nature of this exercise places heavy emphasis on expert modelling, \nand distinguishes it from many MCDAs in the environmental domain in the UK, \nwhere the emphasis is on structuring the analysis around stakeholder \nengagement (7, 14). Thus Stern built an argument for immediate and strong \n 11 \ncutbacks in carbon emissions on the basis of a wide range of technical modelling \nexercises to quantify costs and benefits. \n \nIn some academic circles, the extent to which Stern\u2019s analysis can be considered \nan example of CBA has been debated (15-19). This appears to stem from the fact that \nStern did not use a single so-called \u2018integrated assessment model\u2019 (see 20) to \nestimate the monetary costs and benefits of emissions reductions. Rather it made \npartial use of a variety of models, on the grounds that no single model could be \nconsidered adequate for all purposes (21). This precluded formal estimation of the \n\u2018optimal\u2019 target for global carbon emissions in welfare-economic terms, which \nwould have been a natural task to undertake if a single model had been used (e.g. in \n22, 23, 24). Another reason why Stern\u2019s analysis deviates from the sort of formal \nmodel-building exercise one might find in an academic paper is uncertainty. At \ntimes Stern built his case on evidence that was not modelled at all (see especially chapter 3 \nof 2). This predominantly concerned the estimation of the benefits of emissions \nreductions (the avoided impacts of climate change), where some of the identified \nrisks were so poorly understood that they had not been incorporated in the \nrelevant models. Nevertheless, the basic logic was to compare costs and benefits \nand to recommend policies that provided net benefits on aggregate (see chapter \n13 of the Review). Indeed, in comparison with previous appraisals of emissions \n 12 \ntargets in the UK (25, 26), the Stern Review included explicit monetisation of the \nbenefits of emissions reductions for the first time (chapter 6). More generally, \nCBA as practised by government rarely, if ever, resembles the sort of purely \nformal analysis that some commentators had in mind when debating the status \nof the Stern Review.1 \n  \nAs mentioned, a particular feature of Stern was its emphasis on analysis of, and \nattitudes to, uncertainty. Stern\u2019s main point, that immediate and strong \nreductions in carbon emissions are warranted, was based on reductions in the \nprobability of particular temperature changes \u2018bought\u2019 by progressively tighter \nclimate targets. These probabilities were derived from complex climate-\nmodelling exercises (e.g. 27). Similarly, the Review\u2019s attempt to estimate the benefits \nof emissions reductions in money units (chapter six) was based on a substantial \nMonte Carlo simulation procedure, as was its principal attempt to estimate costs \n(28`, in chapter 9). \n \n2.2. Deliberation strategy \n \n                                                 \n1 We are grateful to Michael Spackman for this point. \n 13 \nWe regard both CoRWM and Stern as having a strong deliberative aspect. \nHowever, they differ both in terms of the internal composition and dynamics of the \nreview team and the extent to which they availed themselves of broader \nmechanisms of public and stakeholder engagement.  \n \nWe deal first with internal composition and dynamics. CoRWM was set up as an \nindependent committee outside the Department for Environment, Food and \nRural Affairs (DEFRA), the central-government department with responsibility \nfor radioactive waste management policy, and the team had a diverse \nmembership, both by discipline (including economics, law, politics, and relevant \nscience and engineering disciplines) and by profession (including academics, a \nlawyer, a lay member and a prominent environmentalist). This contrasts with a \ntraditional advisory committee, with highly focussed and directly relevant \nexpertise. Members of CoRWM were senior and in some sense equal in rank; \nmost had several decades of relevant experience. While some members had spent \na large portion of their working lives in the nuclear industry, others were \nopponents of UK policy, both on radioactive waste management and nuclear \nmatters more generally. By contrast, the Stern Review was undertaken \u2018in-house\u2019 \nby a team of civil servants either directly in the employ of the Treasury or on \nsecondment from other central-government departments with a policy interest \n 14 \n(e.g. DEFRA, the Department for International Development, and the then \nDepartment of Trade and Industry). The review team sat within the Treasury \nand contributions from independent experts such as academics were invited \neither on an informal, advisory basis or on a consultancy basis. While by all \naccounts the Review was produced by a team, it contrasts with CoRWM in being \ndeliberately structured around a significant public figure.  \n \nIn addition to its status and composition, the two processes differed in terms of \nthe use they made of formal public and stakeholder engagement mechanisms. \nExternal parties were extensively involved in CoRWM\u2019s formulation of the \nproblem and in various stages of CoRWM\u00b4s decision process from long-listing to \noption assessment, as well as commenting on the recommendations. Indeed, both \nCoRWM\u2019s members and outsiders such as its Independent Evaluator regarded \nits public and stakeholder engagement as ground-breaking in the UK (29). Central \nto its engagement were three separate fora for ongoing dialogue with external \ninterests: a National Stakeholder Forum of various interest groups, which met \nfour times over the course of the review; eight Nuclear Site Stakeholder Round \nTables comprising stakeholders from nuclear communities, which met three \ntimes; and four Citizen\u2019s Juries (30, 31), which each met three times. CoRWM took \nparticular care to feed its deliberations back to these various fora, so that while \n 15 \nthere was a recognition that not everyone would agree with the Committee\u2019s \nemerging view, there was no doubt that all expressed opinions had been \nconsidered. This intensive engagement exercise was complemented by a broader \nexercise in disseminating information and soliciting views, including the \ncirculation of a discussion guide to many hundreds of stakeholder groups across \nthe UK.  \n \nThe Stern Review on the other hand did not bring external parties into the \nprocess so formally and so intensively. A call for evidence was opened in early \nOctober 2005 and was closed by mid January 2006. Shortly afterwards, at the \nOxford Institute of Economic Policy (\u2018Oxonia\u2019) Distinguished Lecture in Oxford \non 31st January 2006, Stern tested out his initial views (32). Many of the ultimate \nfindings of the Review were presaged here. Further responses to the Oxonia \nlecture were invited until March. Both prior and subsequent to the Oxonia event, \nStern and his team also engaged in an extensive programme of consultation with \nacademics, policy-makers and non-governmental actors, both at home and across \nmany of the countries seen to be important in international climate negotiations, \nsuch as Brazil, China, India and the United States. Yet these were typically one-\noff and informal, either in the nature of fact-finding or of dissemination of \nemerging conclusions. While views were diligently and extensively sought, there \n 16 \nwas no formal provision for the consultees to monitor whether and to what \nextent their views were impacting on decisions, which is the defining \ncharacteristic of the \u2018consultation\u2019 mode of public and stakeholder engagement, \nas famously set out by Arnstein (33) in her \u2018ladder of citizen participation\u2019. There \nwas little if any engagement with lay members of the general public; these \nmyriad consultations tended to be restricted to academic and policy networks. \nThis is not to deny that the Stern Review process was deliberative. Rather, the \npoint we seek to make is that Stern\u2019s public and stakeholder engagement was \ninformal and inward looking (towards established nodes of influence in \ndomestic and international climate policy), while CoRWM\u2019s was formal and \noutward looking. \n \n3. WHY DID THE REVIEWS DIFFER? \n \nWhile there were real and stark differences between the two reviews, we would \ncaution the reader against interpreting them as polar opposites. The CoRWM \nmembers, for example, were very aware that their role was not simply to reflect \nback public opinion, but to take responsibility for recommending to government, \nand the substantial amount of intellectual work which CoRWM put in, \nassembling and cross-checking facts and weighting judgement and argument, is \n 17 \nevident in their final report, just as was the case for Stern. And just as CoRWM \nwas at pains to point out that the MCDA \u2013 as the decision-analytic literature \nconsistently stresses \u2013 was a tool to support decision making, not an attempt to \nautomate it, Stern also rejected the identity that might be constructed between \npolicy analysis and formal modelling, in the conviction that the application of \neconomic tools to policy must be done with careful attention to underlying (and \noften implicit) assumptions and value judgements embedded in these tools.  \n \nNevertheless, as we have emphasised above, CoRWM and Stern, despite their \nsimilarities, differed substantially in terms of both their choice of analytic \nmethod, as well as their deliberation strategy. To some extent, these choices were \nlinked: insofar as Stern is an economic review, it is also technical, requiring \nfamiliarity with economic theory and methods; CoRWM\u2019s diverse team, on the \nother hand, produced a report which has no specific disciplinary allegiance. \nCBA, although it draws on public values through surveys and market studies, is \nnot an instrument for consultation, while MCDA has been promoted by \nopponents of CBA as a form of analysis which is more inherently democratic, \nparticipative, and multiperspectival (e.g. 34, 35) (while on the other hand proponents \nof CBA sometimes present MCDA as supine or vacuous, doing nothing more \nthan reflecting back to decision makers their own beliefs).  \n 18 \n \nWe now turn to discussing explanations for the observed differences. In doing \nso, we follow recent contributions to the literature on risk regulation (e.g. 36) and on \npolicy appraisal (e.g. 37), which attempt to dig beneath the surface of apparently \noverarching trends in regulation (e.g. 38, 39) to describe and explain why in fact the \nstyle and stringency of regulation often varies from one risk to another. What \nsuch contributions have fruitfully asked is whether differences in the nature of \nregulation, including different methods of gathering information such as, in our \ncase, different approaches to strategic appraisal, are due to differences in the type \nof risk or differences in the political context, such as public opinion and pressure \nfrom interest groups. Here we consider two aspects of the type of risk to be \nregulated \u2013 (i) the nature of the underpinning science of climate change compared \nwith radioactive waste and (ii) the scale of the problem \u2013 before going on to \nconsider (iii) the political context.  \n \n3.1. Underpinning science \n \nIn both cases there are considerable similarities in the role of the underpinning \nscience. For both climate change and radioactive waste, scientists feel that much \nof the basic underlying science is well-understood (the role of greenhouse gases \n 19 \nhas been understood since Tyndall; North (40) remarks that \u201cthere is nothing \nunusually mysterious to the trained scientist about nuclear energy, ionizing \nradiation or radioactive isotopes\u201d). This does not, however, preclude uncertainty \nabout the performance of particular systems, for example the climate system, or \nthe behaviour of radioactive waste under the unusual conditions it will \nencounter in a geological repository, or its movement and impacts in the \nbiosphere. In both cases, such evidence as there is concerning system behaviour \ncomes from the distant past: in the case of radioactive waste the Oklo deposit in \nGabon where a naturally occurring nuclear reactor left deposits of radioactive \nnuclides in a geological setting; in the case of climate change, much relevant \nevidence comes from palaeoclimatological studies of climate fluctuations. The \nfact that these events are so long in the past contributes to uncertainty, but in \nboth cases the uncertainty is compounded by the need to extrapolate to \nsituations which do not precisely correspond to any previously experienced. \nAlthough radioactive wastes will potentially remain hazardous for tens or \nhundreds of thousands of years, this profoundly long timescale is not a feature \nunique to radioactive waste; many of the consequences associated with climate \nchange such as sea-level rise are also not just long-lasting, but effectively \nirreversible; consequences may be felt not merely for millennia, but forever.  \n \n 20 \nAs there appear to be no sharp differences between the role of science per se, and \nas both reviews were scientifically-informed, broadly accepting the mainstream \nscientific consensus, rather than attempting to commission much in the way of \nfurther scientific research, we conclude that differences in the science of the two \nissues does not explain the difference in approach of the reviews.  \n \n3.2. Scale of the problem \n \nThe scale of the problem, in particular how it is reflected in the respective policy \nframeworks, begins to give a better sense of the reasons for the difference in \napproach. Radioactive waste is intrinsically a national problem: countries have to \nmanage a stock of radioactive waste produced by activities permitted and \nregulated by (if not actually carried out by) national governments. The UK, in \ncommon with many other countries, has committed to a policy of self-sufficiency \nin the management of Intermediate and High-Level radioactive waste, meaning \nthat waste should be managed locally within the UK (41). Indeed, radioactive \nwaste is not only national, it is local, in the sense that the waste is produced by a \ncomparatively small set of processes (nuclear power, defence, medical and some \nindustrial processes) in comparatively small volumes (relative to other material \nflows), and coupled with the fact that the sunk costs of storage\/disposal \n 21 \ncommand a relatively high share of the total costs, a single community has to be \nfound to \u201chost\u201d the waste. As a result, much of the politics of radioactive waste is \ndriven by resistance, or the threat or prospect of resistance, from these host \ncommunities, and issues of equity, justice and procedural fairness loom large (42-\n45).  \n \nConversely, climate change is a truly global, systemic, and transboundary \nhazard. The effects of greenhouse gases are global, since they are transmitted to \nthe regional and local levels through global changes to the climate system. At the \nsame time, all nations are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, albeit in \ndifferent proportions, and in most nations there are numerous sources of \nemissions. It is beyond the ability of any individual nation, even the biggest, to \nunilaterally reduce global emissions to low levels. There is also the disincentive \nto do so arising from the public-good nature of the hazard (i.e. other nations can \nfree ride on these efforts). Thus climate change is an issue for international \ncollective action, and national-level actions are highly contingent on the \nachievement of an acceptable international agreement. Furthermore, the cost \nstructure of options to reduce emissions points to a wide portfolio of measures, \ndue to the sheer magnitude of emissions reductions that many consider \n 22 \nnecessary, which ultimately overwhelms the economies of scale associated with \nany one currently practicable measure (e.g. 46, 47). \n \nThese differences in the scale of the issues, summarised in table II, lead us \ndirectly into the policy context and history. \n \nTable II about here \n \n3.3. Political context \n \nOn political context, the issues can also be sharply distinguished (see table III). Of \ncourse there are again similarities. Both hazards are critically linked with \u2013 and \nlinked by \u2013 energy policy. Roughly one quarter of global greenhouse gas \nemissions comes from the power sector; in the UK it is closer to one third (48). \nMoreover replacing fossil-fuel electricity generation capacity with nuclear power \nis considered by many, including the UK government, to be a promising option \nfor reducing emissions. In the UK, there is some urgency surrounding energy-\nsupply policy, because a significant portion of the country\u2019s current generation \ncapacity will need to be replaced in the coming decade or two. In both cases, the \n 23 \nissue is contentious, with significant interest groups and pressure groups with \nstrong views on either side of the issue. \n \nTable III about here \n \nHowever, there have been clear differences in the state of, and pressures on, UK \npolicy towards radioactive waste, compared with climate change. Radioactive \nwaste management has been on the policy agenda for several decades and the \nUK government, through its implementor the Nuclear Industry Radioactive \nWaste Executive (NIREX), has repeatedly tried and failed to develop solutions (1, \n49). The history of both radioactive waste management in particular and nuclear \ntechnology in general has left a legacy of suspicion and distrust of state- and \nindustry-sponsored actors and established science, and their combined ability to \ndeliver solutions in the UK and internationally (50-52). While the mainstream \nscientific community has tended to favour geological disposal solutions (or even \nmore politically controversial sub-seabed solutions), this has not been a view \nshared by the public at large, or by environmental organisations (for example, \nthe Royal Society (53), in its role as the UK national academy of science, noted \u201cWe \nconclude that deep geological disposal is the best available long-term option, but \nrecognise the fact that this is not yet widely accepted.\u201d). CoRWM was initiated \n 24 \nagainst this backdrop, after the NIREX-sponsored programme\u2019s application to \nbuild an underground laboratory in Cumbria as a prelude to the construction of \na repository had been rejected by the Secretary of State. At this point, the \nradioactive waste management process in the UK had stalled. \n \nWith climate change, the position was different. Public concern in the UK about \nclimate change was consistently high in the years running up to the \ncommissioning of the Stern Review, as evidenced by a range of opinion polls. \nOne poll conducted in 2004 found that 63% of respondents supported the \nproposition \u201cassume the worst and take major action now to reduce human \nimpacts on climate, even if there are major costs\u201d (54). Exactly 63% of respondents \nin a 1999 poll had supported the same proposition (54). More importantly, instead \nof actively distrusting the role of the state, similar opinion polling showed that a \nclear majority (70%) of Britons called for the government to \u201ctake the lead in \ncombating climate change, even it means using the law to change people\u2019s \nbehaviour\u201d (55). Unlike radioactive waste then, this put UK public opinion in line \nwith the consensus view from the scientific community, and with a political \nconsensus shared by all three of the UK\u2019s main parties (56). \n \n 25 \nYet such a high degree of public support was not matched at the time by concrete \npolicy measures domestically, nor was it always mirrored in other parts of the \nworld. For example, the aforementioned survey was also administered to a \nsample from the United States, finding that in 2004 only 48% supported the \nproposition \u201cassume the worst and take major action now to reduce human \nimpacts on climate, even if there are major costs\u201d, which was itself only slightly \nup from 46% in 1999 (54). Indeed, these two observations are related, because it \nwas the lack of progress in the international negotiations on climate change, \ncaused in turn by insufficiently strong domestic constituencies in favour of action \nto curb emissions in key countries like the United States, which rendered UK \npoliticians reluctant to advance too far. \n \n3.4. Weighing up the explanations  \n \nThe framing of CoRWM\u2019s task reflects the pervasive lack of public trust on the \nnuclear issue. CoRWM\u2019s brief was explicitly \u201cto arrive at recommendations \nwhich can inspire public confidence and are practicable in securing the long term \nsafety of the UK's radioactive wastes\u201d, with the sponsor further noting (to \neliminate any residual ambiguity) that the Committee \u201cmust therefore listen to \nwhat people say during the course of its work, and address the concerns that \n 26 \nthey raise\u201d (1, Annex 1). This is in line with international good practice in radioactive \nwaste management (45); also UK national commentators, including those with \nlinks to the earlier, failed, NIREX process, have come to the view that more \ntransparent, responsive and participatory approaches are essential to meaningful \nprogression (49). Yet in the light of the essentially national scale of the problem, \nthere was no need to involve and convince an international audience. Although \nCoRWM was chaired by an economist, there is little direct evidence of an \neconomic imprint on CoRWM\u2019s report, albeit CoRWM did commission work on \nthe costs of the various options. \n \nIn the case of climate change, facing a domestic public which shared scientists\u2019 \nconcerns, but a sceptical international community which required convincing \nand motivating, the challenge was to garner international support. Jordan and \nLorenzoni (56`, p310) argue persuasively that the Stern Review was part of a \u201cmuch \ngrander geo-strategic plan to convince the rest of the world that \u2018business as \nusual\u2019 will eventually lead to unacceptable risks\u201d. Making the economic case for \naction was a pivotal part of this plan. Indeed, the Stern Review was \ncommissioned against the backdrop of the so-called \u2018Gleneagles Dialogue on \nClimate Change\u2019, conducted under the auspices of the G8 together with the five \nleading emerging economies. In this context, we can understand the ministerial \n 27 \nhome of the Stern Review in the UK\u2019s central government (i.e. the Treasury, \nrather than DEFRA), its terms of reference to take a global view over the \nmedium- to long-term, and ultimately its choice of CBA for the task. The \ninternational imperative to conduct an economic assessment of climate targets \nwas buttressed by certain domestic political dynamics. A report by the House of \nLords Select Committee on Economic Affairs (57) had been quite critical of the lack \nof economic evidence used to form climate policy in the UK. Partly as a response \nto this and partly in expectation of the likely increasing fiscal importance of \nclimate policy in the future (e.g. through revenues from carbon taxation), climate \nchange rose up the list of priorities for the Treasury. Without the need to win \nover the domestic public, it is equally clear why much less emphasis was placed \non public and stakeholder engagement.  \n \nOverall this discussion suggests that the differences in approach taken by the \ntwo reviews are much more obviously explained by political context, and in turn \nby scale, than they are by the scientific nature of the problem: different political \npressures and imperatives prevailed at the time CoRWM and Stern were \ncommissioned; and the constituencies or \u2018audiences\u2019 were different. Thus \nCoRWM\u2019s broad-based membership and emphasis on transparency in modelling \nwere well suited to a policy problem characterised by a legacy of suspicion and \n 28 \ndistrust. Stern\u2019s technically rich CBA, on the other hand, was well suited to a \npolicy problem characterised by a (perceived) lack of economic credibility behind \nambitious climate targets. \n \nTo develop this point in more detail, we now turn to the question of \u2018how\u2019, as \nopposed to \u2018why\u2019, the respective approaches of the two reviews were chosen. In \nboth cases, it is evident that the approach was framed to a large extent by the \nterms of reference that were drawn up, and hence the choice was indeed made at \nan early, political stage. As we have mentioned, CoRWM\u2019s terms of reference \nplaced heavy emphasis on public and stakeholder engagement, and they also \narguably anticipated that MCDA would be the analytic approach most suited to \nstructure this engagement, since they required the identification of \u201ccriteria\u201d for \nassessment (but not, for example, \u201cscenarios\u201d, which might have led to a greater \nfocus on uncertainty). At the same time, Stern\u2019s terms of reference, which were \nafter all drawn up by the Treasury, called inter alia for an examination of the \nevidence on \u201cthe costs and benefits of actions to reduce the net global balance of \ngreenhouse gas emissions\u201d (2, p ix). Elsewhere in Stern\u2019s terms of reference, the \nReview is charged with the task of \u201ctaking into account the risks of increased \nclimate volatility and major irreversible impacts\u201d. \n \n 29 \nFrom this point of departure, any further choices to be made appear to have \nflowed largely from the individuals appointed to carry out the reviews, and the \nmethods with which they were familiar. This is perhaps most obviously true of \nStern, one of the UK government\u2019s most senior economists at the time, who \nbrought with him decades of experience in welfare economics in general and \nCBA in particular. But it is also true of CoRWM. Key documents (both internal \nand from outside experts) from the early stages of developing CoRWM\u2019s \nmethodology show that prior experience with MCDA played a role in its choice, \nin particular in connection with the \u2018Best Practicable Environmental Option\u2019 \nprocedures for radioactive waste disposal at UK nuclear sites, and the NIREX \nwaste disposal site selection processes of the 1980s and 1990s (58, 59). This is despite \nthe fact that the problem CoRWM faced was different, being larger in scale and \nmuch more challenging (in that it was asked not to recommend a site, but a way \nforward more generally). In this sense CoRWM\u2019s approach can be thought of as \ncreatively making use of an approach which already had a track record in the UK \nradioactive waste context. \n \nTo turn around the question of how the review\u2019s approaches came to be chosen, \nwe can also ask what was ignored in the process of making this choice. Neither \nreview made its choice of approach on the basis of a comprehensive survey of \n 30 \nmethodological possibilities. While it is clear that Stern thought reflectively about \nthe strengths and limitations of formal CBA (see e.g. chapters 2 and 6 of 2), there is no \nevidence to suggest that this thinking extended to considering whether methods \ncould be borrowed from the tradition of MCDA. Turning to CoRWM, \nprobabilistic methods are mentioned in a peer review of an early methods \ndocument by a prominent international decision and risk analyst (60), but this \ndoes not seem to have been taken up by CoRWM. Equally, formal economic \nmethods are dismissed in a single line in a Review of Options Assessment \nMethodologies commissioned by CoRWM (59) (\u201cSimply using economic models has \nbeen widely questioned: for example, \u2018how can you value a feeling of well-being?\u2019\u201d, \np 1). To summarise, neither review appears to have seriously engaged with the \npossibilities offered by methods from outside the relevant discipline and \ntradition. In the next section we will consider whether that was a mistake. \n \n4. SHOULD THE REVIEWS HAVE BEEN LESS DIFFERENT, AND WHAT \nCOULD THEY HAVE LEARNED FROM EACH OTHER? \n \nWe are left with a more normative question; could and should the two reviews \nhave been less different? It is worth highlighting at the outset that both reviews \nwere, on the whole, well received. CoRWM\u2019s public and stakeholder engagement \n 31 \nis regarded as an outstanding achievement by, for instance, the Independent \nEvaluator (29), and its substantive conclusions have also been well received by, for \ninstance, the Royal Society (61), and by the House of Lords Science and \nTechnology Committee (62). The Stern Review\u2019s conclusions were also well \nreceived in many quarters, with, for instance, an impressive range of \nendorsements published with the book version of the review report (2), and the \nReview has stimulated and focussed public and political attention both in the UK \nand internationally. We personally regard both reviews as substantial \nachievements and \u201cfit for purpose\u201d, although acknowledging that our respective \nroles mean that we may not have been entirely unbiased. \n \nNevertheless, both reviews have generated ongoing controversy. Without \nseeking to canvass all views on the two reports (which would require a paper, or \nperhaps a book, by itself), we focus on two issues of particular interest for our \ncurrent comparison. One is the role of uncertainty and the recommendation of an \nintensified R&D programme in the case of CoRWM. The other is the handling of \nbenefits accruing to future generations in the case of Stern.  \n \nTurning first to uncertainty in radioactive waste management, one reading of the \ncase proponents make for geological disposal is that, while neither disposal nor \n 32 \nstorage are risk-free, the probability of any given level of environmental \ndegradation is lower under the disposal option than under the storage option. \nEqually, a key question in deciding the form of the waste management strategy is \nthe scheduling of events, including the timing and conditions under which \nconstruction would begin on a repository, and the timing and conditions of the \nclosing of the repository. Indeed, it has been argued that properly understanding \nthe meaning of the concept of retrievability is pivotal in interpreting the feedback \nfrom the public and stakeholder engagement (63). It follows that the suitability of a \nparticular analytic approach rides to a significant extent on its capacity to deal \nwith these issues. \n \nIn the MCDA, CoRWM\u2019s approach was to try to formalise these aspects of the \ndecision problem in criteria, such as \u201cpublic safety\u201d and \u201cflexibility\u201d. In the \nparticular variant of MCDA it used (a multi-attribute value model), performance \non one criterion was then traded off against performance on the other, and so on \nagainst performance on a wide range of other criteria. Elsewhere, the CoRWM \nreport (chapter 18, p 147) makes an extensive qualitative survey of the \nuncertainties surrounding the options, noting that scientists have expressed \nconfidence in geological disposal as a generic concept, but also that new \nuncertainties may arise in moving from a generic concept to a specific facility \n 33 \ndesign. It further discusses possible concerns about the bias of the same scientific \ncommunity, due to institutional links to the nuclear industry. In the light of this \nuncertainty, CoRWM made a formal recommendation that there should be an \n\u201cintensified programme of research and development into the long-term safety \nof geological disposal\u201d. However, because the report relies heavily on qualitative \nstatements of uncertainty, the degree of uncertainty is unclear, as is the extent of \nthe expanded R&D programme. The government\u2019s response to the \nrecommendation on R&D is equivocal and falls short of committing new money \nto relevant R&D; effectively, the issue is thrown back to the technical \nestablishment, in the shape of the regulators and to the Nuclear \nDecommissioning Agency (64). One of the CoRWM members has subsequently \nexpressed his disappointment at this aspect of the government\u2019s follow-through \n(63). \n \nAgainst this backdrop, we believe that a formal probabilistic modelling approach \n(65), of the sort undertaken by Stern or as exemplified in other approaches such as \ndecision trees (66) and real options (67), would have had the advantage of making \nkey uncertainties explicit and discussable, and could have helped clarify both the \nmeaning of the nature of the solutions on the table, in particular with respect to \n 34 \nthe conditions for undertaking particular actions (such as sealing the repository) \nand expectations about the scope of an expanded R&D programme. \n \nFor its part, the Stern Review received some heavy criticism from those who took \nissue with a number of features of the Review\u2019s CBA, especially its choice of an \nunusually low discount rate to compare the future benefits of emissions \nreductions with their present costs (18, 68-71). The discount rate captures a key \nethical trade-off between burdens on the present generation and burdens on \ngenerations in the far-off future. It has long been known that the results of a CBA \nof climate targets are very sensitive to the discount rate (compare 22, 72). What many \ncommentators found disappointing about the Stern Review was the lack of \nsensitivity analysis to demonstrate the contingency of the overall \nrecommendations on the discount rate: in other words, the Review was seen to \nbe trying to impose a particular view on intergenerational equity, and to be \ndoing so without openness (73, 74). This was self-defeating, as in certain quarters it \ndiminished the Review\u2019s capability to persuade people into support for curbing \ngreenhouse gas emissions. \n \nHence, just as CoRWM could have benefitted from Stern\u2019s explicitly probabilistic \napproach, we consider that Stern could have benefitted from CoRWM\u2019s intensive \n 35 \nuse of public and stakeholder engagement. As Stern notes repeatedly, at the core \nof climate-change policy is an ethical problem. It could be that the public at large \nfeel a strong sense of obligation to future generations; however, Stern did not \nseek evidence that this was the case, nor did they seek to probe exactly what is \nthe nature of that obligation. Such an engagement would have given Stern \nammunition to deal with its critics. Moreover, in times of economic difficulty, a \nreal danger is that national publics may lose the will to incur the very concrete \ncosts of action. Some level of prior public engagement might well have \nstrengthened public resolve to see through the necessary sacrifices \u2013 in \nYankelovich\u2019s (75) terms, to \u201ccome to public judgement\u201d, and accept the necessary \ntradeoffs.  \n \nReflecting on the comparison, we argue that CoRWM could have benefitted from \nsome formal uncertainty analysis, just as Stern could have benefitted from some \nextra public engagement \u2013 although of course all reviews operate within a fixed \nbudget envelope and delivery date and any additional activity must be \ncounterbalanced by cuts elsewhere. One possible objection, however, is that \nStern\u2019s analytic approach and its deliberative strategy were bound up together, \nas were CoRWM\u2019s; and that attempts to be at the same time intensely technically \nanalytic and extensively participative are bound to fail. The reasoning behind \n 36 \nthis goes beyond the simple observation that both analysis and participation \nrepresent competing demands on resources. Rather, the thought is that the \nproliferation of technical detail makes meaningful lay participation impossible, \nand discussion fora become dominated by those with technical expertise. \nObviously there may be an element of truth in this, but we see the challenge for \nfuture strategic reviews not as deciding where they want to position themselves \non an analysis-deliberation frontier, but as pushing forward that frontier, \ndeveloping new and better ways to combine analysis and deliberation, as both \nStern and CoRWM, in their different ways, attempted to do. For example, \nCoRWM\u2019s use of longitudinal engagement mechanisms (the citizen\u2019s juries and \nroundtables which met multiple times following a roadmap leading to decision, \nwith feedback between rounds of consultation) provided a way to help \nnonexperts build specialist knowledge and contribute more meaningfully. \nStern\u2019s modelling, to take another example, captured key value judgements \nwithin a small number of parameters governing the discount rate, thus \npotentially providing a way for concerned parties without a background in the \nunderpinning theory to understand the implications of their moral intuitions \nabout obligations to future generations.  \n \n5. CONCLUSION \n 37 \n \nIn this paper, we have attempted a comparison of two quite different strategic \npolicy reviews commissioned by the UK government on issues of environmental \nrisk. We have expounded the differences in the ways in which the two reviews \nattempted to incorporate both analysis and deliberation in their working through \nof the respective issues. We have explored reasons for the differences, and \nargued that much of the difference can be explained by the political context in \nwhich the reviews took place, rather than the intrinsic nature of the risk decision \nitself. There is an argument that the subject matter and overall context of these \nreviews is so different that little can be learned from the comparison: that we are \ncomparing apples and oranges. We would strongly contest this: as we have \nrehearsed throughout this paper, although there are dissimilarities, the \nsimilarities between the underlying risk decisions are pronounced, making the \ndifferences in the analytic and deliberative approaches taken, if anything, still \nmore surprising and worthy of comment. \n \nThe overarching motivation of this paper is the improvement of risk-related \ndecision making, in particular the use of formal techniques such as CBA and \nMCDA. We find it disconcerting that policy reviews in the environmental \ndomain should take such dissimilar forms. Ultimately these reviews are intended \n 38 \nto provide government with a reasoned basis for undertaking action. While we \nrecognise that the study methodologies chosen, and the mode of presentation of \nresults, will be influenced by political context, we would like to feel that there is \na core of argumentation underpinning policy which is method-independent. \nOtherwise, the question naturally arises: were the conclusions reached \ndetermined by the methods used?  \n \nThis is not to say that different people may not take quite different views on the \nsame policy issue. In dealing with complex environmental risks such as \nradioactive waste and climate change there are critical questions of time \npreference, risk attitude, attitude to distributional equity, responsibility to the \nnon-human natural world, and confidence in the ability of the scientific \nestablishment to deliver reliable predictions. Such questions are inherently \njudgemental. However, the role of methods such as CBA and MCDA should be \nto help decision makers structure and clarify these judgements; as their \nproponents repeatedly stress, they should not make the decision, and insofar as \nkey value judgements are implicitly embedded in the methods, they fail. \n \nThe general implication of this line of reasoning is that choice of study method in \nsuch reviews should be, as far as possible, reflective, informed by an awareness \n 39 \nof a range of methods and an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. \nOthers have suggested criteria which may be used to guide methods choice: for \nexample, Fischoff, Lichtenstein, Slovic, Derby and Keeney (76) suggest approaches \nto supporting decisions should be: comprehensive; logically sound; practical; \nopen to evaluation; politically acceptable; compatible with institutions; and \nconducive to learning; Dietz and Stern (77) consider that science has the best \nchance of being integrated with public participation if the methods used ensure \nthat: decision-relevant information is accessible to all parties; explicit attention is \ngiven to both facts and values; analytic assumptions and uncertainties are \nexplicitly described; and there is independent review and learning as new \ninformation comes to light. \n \nWe also consider that that reviews should draw on multiple methods, deploying \nand combining them in creative ways in order to best meet the needs of the study \nin question. In the specific case of Stern and CoRWM, our conclusion is that the \ntwo reviews could have learned from each other: some of Stern\u2019s analytic \napproaches, particularly around the explicit handling of uncertainty, could \nprofitably have been used to strengthen CoRWM\u2019s case; and some of CoRWM\u2019s \npublic and stakeholder engagement would have added robustness to Stern\u2019s \ndiscussion of the ethics of climate change. Irrespective of whether the reader \n 40 \naccepts this view, what seems harder to dispute is that frameworks for the \ndesign of strategic appraisal of environmental risks are lacking. In settings such \nas routine appraisal, there are detailed technical guidelines about how problems \nare to be modelled (e.g. in the UK there is the so-called Green Book (76)), and one \ncan expect that appraisers will follow the guidelines and justify when they \ndepart from them. However, in the context of these \u201cstrategic appraisals\u201d as we \nhave called them, there seems to be no way of learning from previous practice in \nother domains, and little in the way of systematic guidance for taking methods \ndecisions. We hope this paper will provide a spur and foundation for the \ndevelopment of such guidance. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nWe would like to thank Ronan Palmer, Chief Economist at the UK\u2019s Environment \nAgency, for the opportunity to present an earlier version of this paper at the \nEnvironment Agency workshop on \u201cValuing Intangibles\u201d, to the participants at \nthat workshop for their feedback, and to Gordon MacKerron for a helpful \ndiscussion.
