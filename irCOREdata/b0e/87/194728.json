INTRODUCTION\nSelf-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are fully quantised atom-like systems in the solid state. Over the past decade\nthere has been a large amount of interest in these structures, mainly due to the potential for applications, for example\nin quantum information processing and optoelectronic devices. Until recently, progress in the field was hampered by\nthe need to study large ensembles of dots and consequently, average dot properties. However, due to advances in\nexperimental techniques it is now possible to study individual dots in detail. Photoluminescence experiments on single\nself-assembled dots can resolve the many particle energy levels to within a fraction of an meV [1]. Scanning tunnelling\nspectroscopy [2] and magneto-tunnelling experiments [3] have been used to directly image the single particle bound\nstates within individual SAQDs, whilst, most importantly, STM images of cleaved quantum dots have been used\nto provide detailed physical information on the shape, size and composition profile of the dots [4]. This additional\ninformation has demonstrated that the bound state wavefunctions of SAQDs are significantly affected by the physical\ndot structure. To calculate the single particle energies to the accuracy now required by experiment, the details of the\nphysical dot structure and most importantly, the strain within each SAQD must be included in the calculation.\nWe propose an efficient method of calculating the electronic states in SAQDs by expanding the SAQD state in\nterms of harmonic oscillator (HO) functions. The motivation being that the actual localised states of the dot may\nbe represented using fewer basis functions if the basis is already localised on the appropriate length scale. To our\nknowledge, no other calculations of the bound state wavefunctions of physically realistic SAQD models have been\nperformed with a HO basis. Instead most work has focused on the expansion of the SAQD states in terms of plane\nwaves [5\u20137], or the solution of the discretised Schro\u00a8dinger equation in real space [8]. Both these methods can be\ncomputationally expensive.\nIn this paper we calculate the bound states of a physically realistic model of a SAQD. The calculation is performed\nwithin the single-band effective mass approximation including the position dependence of the effective mass and the\neffect of the strain field within the system. The bound electron wavefunctions are calculated by exact diagonalisation\nof the Hamiltonian. A comparison is then made between the convergence of the calculation with a harmonic oscillator\nbasis and the convergence with a plane wave basis. We show that the advantages of the harmonic oscillator basis are\ntwofold. First, the bound state energies are found to converge much more rapidly with the HO basis. We demonstrate\nthat the ground state energy may be calculated to within 1% with only a few tens of HO states as compared to a\nfew thousand plane wave states. As the time taken to diagonalise an Nbs \u00d7Nbs matrix scales as N3bs this leads to a\ndramatic reduction in the required computing time. Second, it is relatively straightforward to include the effects of\nmagnetic fields in the calculation with the HO basis. In this paper we calculate the field dependence of the bound\nelectron states between 0 and 20T.\n2II. METHOD\nA. The dot model\nThroughout this work we use a dot model with dimensions and composition identical to those measured by Bruls\net al [4] using cross sectional scanning tunnelling microscopy. The physical description of the dot provided by Bruls\net al is very detailed and is therefore used as an example of a typical dot. The calculational methods described in\nthis paper are, however, completely general and may be used to calculate the bound states within SAQDs of arbitrary\nshape, size and composition profile.\nThe Bruls dot (see Fig. 1) is a square based truncated pyramidal IncGa1\u2212cAs dot with an Indium fraction varying\nlinearly from c = 0.6 at the base of the dot to c = 1 at the top of the dot. The SAQD rests on a 0.6 nm InAs wetting\nlayer and is surrounded by a GaAs matrix. The dot base is 18 nm x 18 nm, the dot height is 5 nm and the top\nsurface has dimension 10.6 nm x 10.6 nm. The origin of the co-ordinate system used is taken to be at the centre of\nthe IncGa1\u2212cAs dot with the z direction defined as the growth direction. The x and y axes are aligned with the edges\nof the dot base. In this model the GaAs cap and substrate have height 30 nm and the entire heterostructure has a\nsquare base of 140 \u00d7 140 nm.\nThe conduction band offset between GaAs and InAs is taken to be 0.797 eV, with bulk electron effective masses in\nGaAs and InAs of 0.067 mo and 0.023 mo respectively. To obtain the relevant parameters in the IncGa1\u2212cAs material\nwe linearly interpolate the effective electron masses, and calculate the conduction band offset in eV with an empirical\nrelation from Barker [6],\nVo = \u22121.178c+ 0.381c2. (1)\nThe composition and the conduction band offset both vary with position.\nB. Solution of the Schro\u00a8dinger equation\nTo calculate the bound energy levels and the electron wavefunctions we use the single-band effective mass approx-\nimation to the Schro\u00a8dinger equation,\nH\u03a8 = E\u03a8,[\n1\n2\n(\u2212ih\u00af\u2207+ eA)M\u22121(\u2212ih\u00af\u2207+ eA) + V (r)\n]\n\u03a8 = E\u03a8, (2)\nwhere M is the effective mass tensor and A is the vector potential related to the magnetic field by B = \u2207\u00d7A. V (r)\nis the electron confinement potential, V (r) = Vo(r) + Vc(r), where Vc(r) is the contribution to the potential due to\nthe strain. The piezoelectric potential is not yet included in this work, however we expect its inclusion to have no\neffect on the convergence rates investigated. The change in the absolute energies of the bound states caused by the\npiezoelectric potential is thought to be small [9].\nThe lattice constant of InAs is 6.7% larger than that of GaAs, consequently the SAQD system is highly strained.\nThe strain field affects the band gaps in the dot and substrate material and hence alters the confinement potential\nand the effective masses throughout the heterostructure. The relations between the hydrostatic (\u01ebh) and biaxial\n(\u01ebb) strains and the strained confinement potentials for electrons, heavy holes (Vhh) and light holes (Vlh) are well\ndocumented in the literature [10],\nVc(r) = ac\u01ebh(r),\nVhh(r) = av\u01ebh(r) +\nb\n2\n\u01ebb(r),\nVlh(r) = av\u01ebh(r)\u2212 b\n2\n\u01ebb(r). (3)\nThen, given the strained potentials, the strained effective electron masses may be evaluated from first order pertur-\nbation theory [10],\nm\u2217z(r) = m\n\u2217\nVc + E\nGaAs\ng \u2212 Vlh\nEg\n,\nm\u2217xy(r) = m\n\u2217\n(Vc + E\nGaAs\ng \u2212 Vhh)(Vc + EGaAsg \u2212 Vlh)\nEg(Vc + EGaAsg \u2212 34Vlh \u2212 14Vhh)\n, (4)\n3where, m\u2217, m\u2217z and m\n\u2217\nxy denote bulk, perpendicular and in-plane effective masses. Vc, and hence the calculated bound\nstate energies are specified with an energy zero at the GaAs conduction band edge. Finally, in units of eV, the band\ngap, Eg, and the deformation potentials, ac, av and b, in IncGa1\u2212cAs are [10],\nEg = 0.41c+ 1.52(1\u2212 c),\nac = \u22125.08c\u2212 7.17(1\u2212 c),\nav = 1.00c+ 1.16(1\u2212 c),\nb = \u22121.80c\u2212 1.70(1\u2212 c). (5)\nGiven the position-dependent confinement potentials and effective masses we can always solve Eq. (2) by expanding\nthe exact wavefunction, \u03a8, in terms of an arbitrary set of basis functions, \u03c8i, and eigenvectors, ai,\n\u03a8 =\n\u2211\ni\nai\u03c8i, (6)\nand then diagonalising the resultant Hamiltonian matrix.\nC. Harmonic oscillator basis\nIn cylindrical polar co-ordinates we may write the actual single particle states of the dot as a sum of harmonic\noscillator functions,\n\u03a8(r) =\n\u2211\ni\nai\u03c8i =\nlmax\u2211\nli=\u2212lmax\nmmax\u2211\nmi=0\nnmax\u2211\nni=0\nalimini\u03a6li(\u03c6)Zmi(z)Rnili(r) (7)\nwhere, the alimini are expansion coefficients, and we have used Nbs = (2lmax+1)(mmax+1)(nmax+1) basis functions\nto approximate the full single particle wavefunction. The individual basis functions in Eq. (7) are given by,\n\u03a6li(\u03c6) =\n1\u221a\n2\u03c0\neili\u03c6\nZmi(z) =\n(\n\u03bbz\n2mimi!\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n) 1\n2\nHmi [(z \u2212 zo)\u03bbz ] e\u2212(z\u2212zo)\n2\u03bb2z\/2,\nRnili(r) =\n(\nni!\u03bb\n2\nr\n2|li|(ni + |li|)!\n) 1\n2\ne\u2212\n1\n4\nr2\u03bb2r (r\u03bbr)\n|li|L|li|ni\n[\n1\n2\nr2\u03bb2r\n]\n. (8)\nIn Eq. (8), Hmi and L\n|li|\nni are the Hermite and Laguerre polynomials respectively [11] and \u03bbz and \u03bbr are the reciprocals\nof the respective length scales of the HO wavefunctions in the parallel and perpendicular directions. The length scales\nand the offset parameter, zo, can be chosen to optimise the rate of convergence of the HO calculation. Essentially\nwe choose values of \u03bbr, \u03bbz and zo to give the ground harmonic oscillator basis function a similar spatial extent to\nthe actual localised state of the dot. This is discussed further in section III B. The values of \u03bbr are taken to be\nindependent of the magnetic field as the changes in length scales caused by fields of up to 20T are less than 2% and\ntherefore have little effect on the convergence rate.\nTo diagonalise the Hamiltonian (Eq. (2)) and solve for the exact single particle states we must calculate the matrix\nelements of the Hamiltonian operator between individual HO states (Eq. (7)),\nHji =\n\u222b\n\u03a6\u2217ljZ\n\u2217\nmjR\n\u2217\nnj lj (Ho +HB)\u03a6liZmiRnilirdrd\u03c6dz, (9)\nwhere we have split the Hamiltonian into a field independent and a field dependent part,\nHo = \u2212 h\u00af\n2\n2\n\u2207M\u22121\u2207+ V (r),\nHB = \u2212 ih\u00af\n2\n\u2207M\u22121eA\u2212 ih\u00af\n2\nM\u22121A \u00b7 \u2207+ 1\n2\n(eA)2M\u22121. (10)\nEquation (9) contains terms in which the differential operator acts on products of the inverse effective mass tensor\nand the basis states. In the present model the effective mass must be calculated numerically, it is therefore advanta-\ngeous to integrate these terms by parts in order to rearrange the operator order. In this way, the terms containing\n4the differential operator may be written as products of the inverse effective mass tensor and derivatives of the basis\nfunctions which may be evaluated analytically. The derivative of the HO function with respect to \u03c6 is easily found,\nwhilst the r and z derivatives may be written in a form similar to that of the wavefunctions themselves by using\nrecurrence relations for the Laguerre and Hermite polynomials [11],\ndZmi\ndz\n=\n(\n\u03bb3z\n2mimi!\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n) 1\n2\n[2miHmi\u22121[(z \u2212 zo)\u03bbz]\u2212 \u03bbz(z \u2212 zo)Hmi [(z \u2212 zo)\u03bbz]] e\u2212(z\u2212zo)\n2\u03bb2z\/2,\ndRnili\ndr\n=\n(\nni!\u03bb\n4\nr\n2|li|(ni + |li|)!\n) 1\n2\ne\u2212\n1\n4\nr2\u03bb2r (r\u03bbr)\n|li|\u22121\n{(\n|li|+ 2n\u2212 1\n2\nr2\u03bb2r\n)\nL|li|ni\n[\n1\n2\nr2\u03bb2r\n]\n\u22122(ni + |li|)L|li|ni\u22121\n[\n1\n2\nr2\u03bb2r\n]}\n. (11)\nThe field independent matrix elements are then given by,\n(Ho)ji =\n\u222b [\nh\u00af2\n2m\u2217xy\nd\u03c8\u2217j\ndr\nd\u03c8i\ndr\n+\nh\u00af2\n2m\u2217z\nd\u03c8\u2217j\ndz\nd\u03c8i\ndz\n+ \u03c8\u2217j\u03c8i\n(\nh\u00af2lilj\n2m\u2217xyr\n2\n+ V\n)]\nrdrdzd\u03c6. (12)\nWith the HO basis it is relatively easy to include the field dependent terms by working in the circular gauge. In\ncylindrical polar co-ordinates we have,\nA = (0,\n1\n2\nBr, 0), (13)\nand the matrix elements containing the three field dependent terms are simply,\n(HB)ji =\neB\n4\n\u222b\n\u03c8\u2217j\u03c8i\n[\neBr2\n2m\u2217xy\n\u2212 h\u00af(li + lj)\nm\u2217xy\n]\nrdrd\u03c6dz. (14)\nThe terms (HB)ij have a very similar form to the matrix elements of the field independent Hamiltonian. The effects\nof the magnetic field may therefore be included with little additional programming effort and CPU time.\nD. Plane wave basis\nThe Schro\u00a8dinger equation may also be solved by expanding the actual wavefunction in terms of plane waves,\n\u03a8(r) =\n\u2211\ni\nai\u03c8i =\nlmax\u2211\nli=\u2212lmax\nmmax\u2211\nmi=\u2212mmax\nnmax\u2211\nni=\u2212nmax\nalimini(8LxLyLz)\n\u2212 1\n2 eiki\u00b7r, (15)\nwhere we have used a total number of Nbs = (2lmax + 1)(2mmax + 1)(2nmax + 1) states in the expansion, and are\nnow working in Cartesian co-ordinates so that r = (x, y, z). The plane wave calculation is carried out with periodic\nboundary conditions,\nki = (ni\u03c0\/Lx,mi\u03c0\/Ly, li\u03c0\/Lz), (16)\nwithin a superlattice unit cell of dimension 2Lx\u00d72Ly\u00d72Lz. The superlattice unit cell size affects both the converged\nvalues obtained for the bound state energies and the rate of convergence of the calculation. This will be discussed in\nsection III C.\nWe must calculate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian in the plane wave basis. Considering the field independent\nHamiltonian and, again integrating by parts so that the differential operators only act on the basis functions, we find,\n(Ho)ji = (8LxLyLz)\n\u22121\n\u222b [\nh\u00af2\n2\n(\nkxjkxi + kyjkyi\nm\u2217xy\n+\nkzjkzi\nm\u2217z\n)\n+ V\n]\nei(ki\u2212kj)\u00b7rdxdydz. (17)\n5III. COMPUTATION\nThe computational problem was split into three parts. First we calculated the strained confinement potential and\neffective masses from Eqs. (1), (3) and (4). We then found the relevant matrix elements in the presence or absence\nof a magnetic field and, finally, diagonalised the Hamiltonian.\nThe diagonalisation was performed with the LAPACK library standard linear algebra routines. We optimised the\ncalculation time for both the HO and the plane wave calculations by considering the symmetry properties of the\ndot. The Bruls dot belongs to the symmetry group C4v, we, however, use the irreducible representations of the more\ngeneral symmetry group, C2v, in order to block diagonalise the Hamiltonian into 4 blocks. Each block can then be\ndiagonalised separately, reducing the time taken to fully diagonalise the matrix by up to a factor of 16. Moving from a\ndescription of this specific SAQD in terms of the C2v symmetry group to a description in terms of the C4v symmetry\ngroup only reduces the time taken to diagonalise the matrix by a factor of about 1.6, at the cost of making the code\nless general. Both rectangular and square based dots belong to the C2v symmetry group and so the methods used for\nblocking the matrix may be applied to both types of SAQD.\nA. Strain\nWe calculate the strain within the continuum elasticity approximation with a commercially available, finite element\nmodel, Abaqus. This model has already been demonstrated to provide an accurate representation of the strain within\na cleaved dot [4]. In this approximation, the system is completely specified in terms of values for the Youngs moduli\nand Poisson ratios (85.3 Gpa (GaAs), 51.4 GPa (InAs) and 0.32 (GaAs), 0.35 (InAs) respectively [12]) and the lattice\nmismatch strain (6.7%). As usual we linearly interpolate to obtain the relevant values in the IncGa1\u2212cAs material.\nIn this paper we are interested in the bound electronic states of an isolated SAQD. We therefore locate the Bruls\ndot at the centre of a 140 \u00d7 140 \u00d7 65.6 nm block of semiconductor material and, when calculating the strain, apply\nperiodic boundary conditions to the edges of this block. This system is large enough so that the strain within each\ndot is unperturbed by the neighbouring dots in the periodic lattice.\nFigure 2 shows the confinement potential, and the electron effective masses as a function of z through the centre of\nthe dot. The characteristic z dependence of the confinement potential and the effective mass comes mostly from the\ndifferences in composition, while the compressive hydrostatic strain inside the dot reduces the electron confinement\npotential from the unstrained well depth of 0.797 eV. The InAs wetting layer is included as an integral part of this\ncalculation. Its effects on the confinement potential and effective mass can be clearly seen in Fig. 2.\nB. Harmonic oscillator basis\nTo calculate the \u03c6 integrals with the HO basis functions we use a fast Fourier transform with 8192 points. The z\nand r integrals are then calculated using Simpson\u2019s rule on a non-uniform grid, with the highest point densities in\nthe regions where the strained potential varies most rapidly. This gives each matrix element to an accuracy of better\nthan 0.05%\nThe rate of convergence of the harmonic oscillator calculation can be improved by optimising zo and the parallel and\nperpendicular length scales of the basis states. This is done by minimising the energy of the ground harmonic oscillator\nstate in the dot potential with respect to the HO length scales, and to the offset of the perpendicular HO states from\nthe centre of the dot, zo. For a given dot we search for the global minimum in Hoo(zo, \u03bbr, \u03bbz) =\n\u222b\n\u03c8\u2217oH\u03c8ordrdzd\u03c6.\nIn the Bruls dot the minimum value of Hoo = \u22120.218 eV is obtained with zo = \u22120.25 nm, 1\/\u03bbr = 3.12 nm and\n1\/\u03bbz = 2.41 nm. Although the convergence rate is improved by optimising these parameters, the rate is not critically\ndependent on the values chosen for zo, 1\/\u03bbr and 1\/\u03bbz, and the final converged values obtained for the bound state\nenergies do not depend on the values chosen for these parameters at all. For example, varying the length scales by\n10% changes the value of Hoo by less than 0.1% and therefore gives little difference in the rate of convergence of the\ncalculation.\nC. Plane wave basis\nThe optimum method to calculate the plane wave matrix elements would appear to be a fast Fourier transform.\nHowever, using the linear grid required for an FFT it proved impossible to calculate the integrals to the required\naccuracy because of the large storage sizes required. At best we obtained converged energies only accurate to within\na few meV of the actual bound state energies.\n6Instead of the FFT, we therefore used a Simpson\u2019s rule routine to perform each of the integrals. The efficiency\nof the integration routine was improved by considering the symmetry properties of this particular SAQD: both the\nx and y integrals are symmetric and real. We estimate that, with this method, we are able to calculate the matrix\nelements to an accuracy of approximately 0.2%.\nThe plane wave calculation was carried out with periodic boundary conditions within a superlattice unit cell of\ndimension 2Lz \u00d7 2Ly \u00d7 2Lx. It was found that the rate of convergence and the converged energies vary according\nto the box size used. Typically, the smaller the box the faster the convergence, however, with smaller box sizes,\nthe bound wavefunctions within each SAQD are perturbed by the neighbouring dots in the periodic lattice. The\nconverged energies are then smaller than those expected for an isolated SAQD.\nThese effects can be observed in a 1D calculation. Figure 3 shows the calculated ground state energy of electrons\nconfined by the radially averaged confinement potential as a function of the perpendicular box size. The energies\ncalculated with a basis of 200 plane waves vary by less than 0.1% beyond a box size of Lz = 18 nm whilst the\nconvergence using 20 plane waves gets progressively worse at larger box sizes. At small box sizes the calculated\nground state energies are much smaller than those of an isolated SAQD. The inset to the plot shows the radially\naveraged confinement potential in eV referenced to the conduction band offset in GaAs, and the negative of the\ncharge density of the converged ground state calculated using Lz = 30 nm. If the tail of the wavefunction overlaps the\nedges of the box, the energies converge to lower values than those for an isolated dot. In the 3 dimensional calculation\nof the electronic states of the Bruls dot we use a box size of Lz = 30 nm, Ly = 30 nm and Lx = 30 nm. However,\nlarger box sizes may be needed to reproduce the isolated dot results for the excited states which have a larger spatial\nextent than the ground state.\nIV. RESULTS\nA. Convergence properties\nUsing the HO basis we calculated the bound state energies of the Bruls SAQD at zero magnetic field. With\nmaximum quantum numbers of lmax = 12,mmax = 20, nmax = 20 and therefore a total number of Nbs = 11025\nharmonic oscillator functions in the basis set we found 6 bound states inside the dot. The energies of the bound states\nare given in table I. The next two most tightly bound states were found to be degenerate and delocalised throughout\nthe wetting layer at an energy of -0.0295 eV relative to the conduction band edge in GaAs. The delocalised states are\neasily identified by examining the spatial extent of the calculated wavefunctions.\nFigure 4 shows the rate of convergence of each of the bound states of the Bruls dot. The plot shows the difference\nin energy between the converged energy and the energies calculated with Nbs basis functions. This is the number of\nbasis functions before the matrix has been blocked. From Fig. 4 we can see the total number of basis states required\nto obtain any given accuracy. For example, we can obtain ground state energies within 1% of the converged energy\nwith only 24 HO basis states (lmax = 0,mmax = 7, nmax = 2). To calculate the ground state energy to within 1 meV\nof the converged energy we need 324 basis states (lmax = 4, mmax = 8, nmax = 3). As we would expect, the excited\nstates are slower to converge but we can achieve 1 meV accuracy for all the bound states of the dot with only 1368\nbasis functions in the expansion.\nAt zero field we also diagonalised the Hamiltonian in a plane wave basis with Nbs = 18081, or maximum quantum\nnumbers of lmax = 20, mmax = 10, nmax = 10 in the z, y and x directions respectively. The energies obtained from\nthe plane wave calculation and the harmonic oscillator calculation typically agree to within a fraction of a percent (see\ntable I). Figure 5 shows the difference in the bound state energies calculated with Nbs plane wave states and those\nobtained with 18081 plane waves in the expansion. This figure demonstrates that the excited states have clearly not\nconverged, even with a total of 18081 basis functions. The ground state is closer to convergence, but its energy is still\ndecreasing by almost 0.05 meV with the addition of extra in-plane states. To obtain a ground state energy within 1%\nof the calculated energy found with 18081 basis states we need to include at least 3993 plane waves in the expansion\n(lmax = 16,mmax = 5, nmax = 5), while to achieve 1 meV accuracy and still retain the C4v symmetry of the dot we\nneed to include a total of 7425 plane waves. The plane wave basis calculation is much slower to converge than the\nHO calculation. We require at least a factor of 100 more states to obtain convergence to within approximately 1%.\nThe excited state energies found with the plane wave expansion converge to values lower than those obtained\nfrom the harmonic oscillator calculation. This indicates that the box size chosen (Lz = Ly = Lx = 30 nm) is too\nsmall to completely reproduce the case of an isolated dot. To emphasise that the energies obtained from the plane\nwave calculation are critically dependent on box size, we recalculated the solutions to the Schro\u00a8dinger equation after\nsetting the inter-dot distance in the periodic lattice to be equal to the dot dimension in each direction. This follows a\nprescription used by Barker [7] to calculate the bound electron and hole states within a square based pyramidal dot\nof height 6nm and base 12 nm \u00d7 12 nm. With a superlattice unit cell of size Lx = 11.2 nm, Ly = 18 nm, Lz = 18 nm\n7for the plane wave calculation we obtain much more rapid convergence for the states in the Bruls dot. The ground\nstate energy was found to be converged to within 1% of the exact energy with only 91 basis states. However the\nvalue obtained for this converged ground state of -0.2472 eV is over 20 meV lower than the ground state energy in an\nisolated dot.\nB. Magnetic field dependence\nThe bound state energies for the Bruls dot were calculated as a function of magnetic field from 0 to 20 T with 7497\nHO states in the expansion to ensure an accuracy to within 0.2 meV for each of the bound states.\nFigure 6 shows the field dependence of the lowest 8 bound states. Because of the large inter-level spacing, typical\nof self-assembled dots, the behaviour with magnetic field is relatively simple. We observe crossings between states\n7 (dashed line) and 8 (dotted line) at 7.2 T, between states 8 and 6 at 13.1 T and between states 6 and 7 at 18.8\nT. We can easily identify crossings and anti-crossings by keeping track of the particular block of the block diagonal\nHamiltonian from which each of the bound state energies originates. State 8 (dotted line), one of a pair of degenerate\ndelocalised states at 0 T, becomes bound within the dot above 8.5 T.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn summary we have demonstrated that the bound electronic states of a self-assembled quantum dot may be\ncalculated more efficiently with a harmonic oscillator (HO) basis than with the commonly used plane wave basis.\nWe calculated the bound electron states within a physically realistic model of a self-assembled quantum dot. The\nsingle-band, position-dependent effective mass Hamiltonian was diagonalised with a harmonic oscillator basis and a\nplane wave basis, and a comparison made between the rates of convergence of the two calculations. It was found that\nthe HO basis gave a much more rapid convergence. Bound state energies within 1 meV of the exact converged energy\nwere obtained with only 324 harmonic oscillator basis functions, while, to achieve similar convergence with a plane\nwave basis, we required at least 7425 plane waves. This leads to a increase in the computer time needed to diagonalise\nthe Hamiltonian matrix by a factor of approximately 12 \u00d7103. In both calculations there is also a significant overhead\ninvolved in setting up the Hamiltonian matrix which is not affected by the choice of basis. The plane wave basis also\nhas a second disadvantage: The energies obtained are critically dependent on the size of superlattice unit cell used.\nFor example, within a superlattice box chosen to give inter-dot separations equal to the dot dimension we obtained\nsimilarly rapid convergence to the HO calculation, but energies which differed from the isolated dot energies by at\nleast 10%.\nIn this paper we have also demonstrated that the effects of a magnetic field may be easily included when working\nwith the HO basis and have shown the field dependence of the bound states between 0 and 20T.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Dr S P A Gill and Dr F Long of the University of Leicester Engineering department for\nuseful discussions and advice on the strain calculations.
