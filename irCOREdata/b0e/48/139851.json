PCM, also known as \nphotoetching, photofabrication or photochemical milling (Allen, 1986), is a non-\ntraditional manufacturing method based on the combination of photoresist imaging \nand chemical etching. There is considerable interest in the need to understand the \n2 \ncosts associated with the PCM process. This paper identifies cost drivers for the \ntechnique, and presents a methodology to develop a cost model for the process. \n \nPCM works on most metals, and uses techniques similar to those employed for the \nproduction of printed circuit boards and silicon integrated circuits. Parts produced \nby PCM are typically thin, flat and, complex. These parts include applications in the \nelectronics, filter, and aerospace industry, while typical products produced by PCM \ninclude: \n \n- Suspension head assemblies for hard disk drive technology. \n- Shadow masks, which are an essential component in colour tubes for \ntelevisions and computers. \n- Integrated Circuit (IC) leadframes that provide the contacts for the \nmicroprocessor and its support.  \n- Decorative items, where the price of the product has to be low, their \ncomplexity high, and the batches not very numerous. \n- Prototyping, where PCM is used because the tooling effort is low, the \nlead-time short, and the precision high. \n \nThe PCM manufacturing process begins by cleaning the metal and coating it with a \nlight-sensitive resist. The coated sheet is then exposed to ultra violet light through \nthe photomaster from both sides, hardening the photoresist where exposure takes \nplace. The unexposed areas are developed away, thereby removing the resist and \nleaving the metal bare where etching will occur. Etching solution is sprayed under \npressure onto the top and bottom surfaces, accurately producing the component by \nremoving the unwanted metal. The resist is then removed to leave burr- and stress-\nfree precision components (Attewell, 2002). \n \nThe paper presents a Cost Model for the PCM process. A Cost Model is a set of \nsystematically-arranged mathematical relationships. Quantities and prices are the \ninputs for these equations, while cost estimates are the outputs. Historical data \navailable from the company, basic engineering principles, characteristics of the \nmanufacturing process, and various economic assumptions (NASA, 2002) are used \nto obtain the Cost Estimating Relationships (CER).  \n \nCost models are used primarily to reduce costs during the design phase of the \nproduct development cycle. Different applications of cost modelling can be \nsummarised as follows:  \n \n- Business process re-engineering: By understanding the cost of a process, \nthe activities that are causing major costs can be improved and the \nimprovement measured. \n- Cost controlling: If an accurate process cost can be obtained, the budget \nfor this process will be set at a certain level. Problems can be addressed by \nidentifying the areas that produce the greatest expenditure. \n- Costing products: The model will help in estimating the cost of a product. \n \nThe paper is structured into six sections. The next section presents an overview of \nrelated research. The third section describes a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) \nfor PCM. The fourth section identifies the cost drivers at different stages of the \n3 \nmanufacturing process, and presents the cost model and its development stages. The \nfifth section presents some data collection and the cost model validation. The final \nsection discusses the results, conclusions, and future work. Overall, the paper \nillustrates an application of existing cost modelling techniques in the new domain of \nPhoto Chemical Machining (PCM); it also provides a better understanding of PCM-\nrelated cost issues. \n \n \n2 COST ENGINEERING AND PCM \n \nCost estimating consists of sequential operations that require either numeric inputs \nor selected descriptive details of the specific estimate. A cost model consists of a set \nof mathematical relationships arranged in a systematic sequence to formulate a cost \nmethodology in which outputs, namely cost estimates, are derived from inputs such \nas quantities and prices. Costing is the technique used to estimate the resources \nrequired for carrying out a project (project cost) or the total cost of producing a \nproduct (product cost).  \n \nCost models have two main purposes in manufacturing: when the process is \nestablished and during the design stage. Therefore, by examining the cost at the \ndesign stage, it is possible to reduce manufacturing cost by using information to \nmake better design decisions (Swardt, 1998). Cost models play an important role \nduring the design of a process or a product by indicating how much it will cost to \nuse a determinate process, material, or product. The main reasons for estimating \ncosts either before or during the early phases of design are to (Bolton, 2003): \n \n- Predict the resources required for the project.  \n- Illustrate the financial consequences for the company.  \n- Justify the design and development time proposed.  \n- Demonstrate the viability of the product in relation to the market. \n \nDuring the detailed design phase, the reasons for estimating cost are to (Bolton, \n2003):  \n \n- Review project progress and budget.  \n- Revise earlier estimates and predictions. \n- Estimate the component manufacturing and delivery costs.  \n- Establish the costs of bought-out components and units.  \n- Compare the costs of competing design proposals.  \n- Confirm estimates of potential profit margins.  \n- Confirm the estimated selling price. \n \nCost models have been used to establish manufacturing process when carrying out \nbusiness process re-engineering (NASA 2002). Cost modelling is also used within \nthe semiconductor industry, for budgeting and cost control; measuring compliance \nperformance; determining reimbursements, and setting fees (Veltri, 2003). A major \napplication of cost estimation is the identification of features of pieces, costing \nthem, and entering them into a database (Chen et al., 1998).  \n \n4 \na) There are different types of cost modelling techniques, such as bottom-up, \nspecific analogy, parametric, cost review and update and expert opinion \n(NASA 2002).  \n \nCost Estimation Relationships (CERs) are an important tool available to the \nestimator. These relations are in the form of cost factors, equations, curves, \nmonograms, and rules of thumb. A statistical CER can be derived from information \nbased on past occurrences, although historical data is not always a reliable guide to \nthe future. Therefore, great care must be taken when extrapolating the relationship \nfrom the sample. The estimator must decide whether the cost estimating \nrelationship is relevant or how it can be modified to be useful. \n \nThe purpose of the cost model development process is to identify and collect \ninformation on products, processes, and costs, and to analyse this information in \norder to quantify the CER that exist (Delgado et al., 2002). The most common steps \nin cost modelling involve determination of the (Brinke, 2002): \n \n- Scope, i.e. costs subdivided in different types, which have to be modelled. \n- Allocation base for (overhead) costs. \n- Cost functions, i.e. the relation between product parameters and costs. \n \nA review of the literature on the cost model development process indicated that, for \nthe present project, it would be more useful to develop a specific approach by \ncombining the previous ones. This new development process was necessary because \nthe previous ones were for other types of project or for people who were working in \nthis area for many years.  \n \nPrevious work in the research area involved the development of Computer Aided \nProcess Planning, Cost Estimating and Job Loading for PCM (Singh, 1988). It is no \nlonger possible to use the computer programme developed, although it is useful for \nthis current research because it was developed for a particular factory and a large \namount of data was available. The current author was able to extract some CERs \nfrom this data and apply it to the present work. The costing criteria used in the \nafore-mentioned work were as follows (Singh, 1988): \n \n- Batch size: A production batch of 100 or more is economical. It is \nnecessary to apply a \u201cnesting factor\u201d if the batch is less than this number.  \n \n- Lead time: The deliverable time for an order influences the cost of the \nparts because the production has to be recalculated and all efforts have to \nbe centred on producing the parts in a short time.     \n \n- Work order preparation cost: If the order is new, it needs more \npreparation (planning, phototooling and administrative charges) than if it \nis repeated.  \n \n- Work tolerance: Less work tolerance requires more process control.  \n \n- Operation costs: The manufacturing costs of the PCM process steps and \nsome post operation were quantified. \n5 \n \nOther useful references about etchant regeneration include increasing the utilisation \nefficiency of ferric chloride (Allen and Ler, 1999). \n \n \n3 THE PCM PROCESS WBS \n \nA WBS for the PCM process was developed to obtain a list of the operations \ninvolved in this manufacturing method for stainless steel machining (Zamora 2003). \nAssociated costs could then be assigned to the operations. The development of the \ncost model depended on the identification of the costs drivers obtained from this \nanalysis. In order to develop both the process WBS and the associated cost of \noperations, it was necessary to gain understanding of the PCM process. It was also \nnecessary to represent the manufacturing process and to select the activities to \nwhich costs needed to be assigned. It must be noted that some activities or \noperations are optional, and that alternative methods can be used to carry them out. \n \nAn understanding of the PCM process was developed through both literature review \nand visits to the PCM laboratory located at Cranfield University.  A process map of \nthe PCM process was developed, and the main activities for the cost model selected. \nThe reasoning behind this selection was that certain techniques were no longer used \nand so it was not necessary to include them. In other cases, the map of an operation \ncontained too many activities and so they had to be included in a general one.  \n \nFigure 1 illustrates the general process map created using IDEF3 notations. Some of \nthe main steps of the process include sub-operations that were considered for \nobtaining the cost drivers.  \nPROCESS\n PHOTOTOOL\n13.1\nEND THE\n PCM\n PROCESS\n23.1\nSTRIP\n PHOTORESIST\n22.1\nETCH\n METAL\n21.1\nPROCESS\n PHOTORESIST\n20.1 PAG 62-74\n&\nJ24\nCOAT THE\n METAL WITH\n PHOTORESIST\n19.1\nPREPARE\n METAL\n18.1\nSELECT\n METAL\n17.1\nPRODUCE\n ARTWORK,\n DRAWING OR\n CAD DATA\n16.1\n&\nJ23\nSTART\n THE\n PCM\n PROCESS\n1.2\nL87L84 L92L91L90L89\nL88L86L85L83\nL82L79\n \nFigure 1. General Process Map \n \n4 COST DRIVERS AND COST MODEL DEVELOPMENT \n \nThe general Process Map for PCM provided the basis to identify the different \nelements of costs involved in the process. These cost elements are the cost drivers \nfor PCM. Costs for each sub process is divided into five categories: material, direct \nlabour, use of equipment, environmental and indirect. Table 1 shows the full list of \ncost drivers involved in the process. The cost drivers were derived through literature \nreview and expert interview within Cranfield University and one company. \n6 \n \nThe cost model was created in such a way that enabled data for a factory to be \nintroduced easily. This data is linked through the model, and so the model can be \nused in a particular factory without the need to change anything. The cost of using \nPCM was represented by filling the cost model with data. The is a Bottom-up \napproach in estimating the cost. \n \nSince the cost model was not developed for a particular factory, it is necessary to \nclearly show the costs considered in establishing the manufacturing costs. For this \nreason, a file was created to show all cost generators. An additional file was created \nto include all possible options of the manufacturing process. Since this information \nwould show too many options, which could or could not be included in the costs, it \ncould not be included in the cost per section file. The following paragraphs provide \na general overview of how the cost model works. In order to run the model, the \nfollowing three workbooks must be open: PCMCostModel.xls, CostPerSection.xls \nand Options.xls . \n \nThe first page of the PCMCostModel.xls shows the author\u2019s contact details and the \nproject title. The second page contains instructions on how to use the cost model. \nThe third page shows the order in which the attributes have to be selected so that \nthe cost of a particular batch of pieces can be identified. The Calculation \nAssumptions are located on the next page of the workbook. This page shows the \ndata used for the cost calculation; the data can be altered for a particular factory. \nThe fifth page is used for performing calculations on the data. The next page is the \ncost model resume, which details the cost per batch and per piece at different stages \nof the manufacturing process. The next worksheet contains links to the \nCostPerSection.xls file; clicking on each box of the process step enables the cost \nincluded in this stage to be displayed. The last page of this workbook contains a list \nof the options that can be selected in the Attributes worksheet. These cost factors \nare written for the different options.  \n \nCostPerSection.xls is the second of the three workbooks; it shows the costs \nconsidered at each stage of the PCM process. The workbook is divided into the \nmain process steps (see figure 1) and General Costs. The workbook contains the \nfollowing worksheets:  \n0. General Costs \n1. Produce Drawing \n2. Process Phototool \n3. Select Metal \n4. Prepare Metal \n5. Coat the Metal \n6. Process Photoresist \n7. Etch metal \n8. Strip Photoresist \n9.

In order not to show an extensive list of costs that are actually included, an \noption selected from this workbook takes the information from the options.xls. This \npage displays the data resulting from the cost calculations performed in the \nassumptions sheet in PCMCostModel.xls.

The purpose of Options.xls workbook is to store the \ndifferent options and techniques that can be considered for an order or a particular \nsub process. The final structure of the three workbooks was completed after several \niterations with domain experts at Cranfield University and in the supporting \ncompany. \n \n5 DATA COLLECTION AND COST MODEL VALIDATION \n \nFollowing construction of the cost model, a list of all the data necessary to calculate \nthe cost was obtained. In order to check if the cost model produces accurate results \ndata was collected and the cost of producing a part was calculated with the accuracy \nexpected from that the data. The data was collected from multiple sources:  \n-     Enterprise Integration Department \n- Literature Review \n- Product Suppliers \n- Machine Manufacturers \n- PCM industries or experts \nDue to confidentiality issues, the data cannot be published in the paper. The \nindustry is also sensitive to cost data information and there is also a possibility of \nbias in data obtained from the companies.  \n \nThe cost model validation took place in two stages: verification and validation. In \nthe verification stage, the model is checked for any manual error in developing the \nmodel. The validation of the cost model was performed through case study and \nexpert opinion after using the model. The validation process fine-tuned the \nperformance of the cost model by changing some data and cost drivers. \n \n6 CONCLUDING REMARKS \n \nThis research has led to the development of a new cost model for Photo Chemical \nMachining. The paper presents the cost involved in using Photochemical \nMachining. The PCM process was identified and structured using the IDEF3 \nmethodology. The IDEF3 maps were used to assign the cost drivers of each \noperation and to structure the cost model. The cost drivers for the PCM \nmanufacturing process have been identified and documented. A cost model for \nPCM has been created and is now in use. It can be used to visually check what costs \nhave been considered and to explain how the cost is obtained. The cost model can \nbe used by the PCM industry for activities such as product costing, process \noptimisation, and cost controlling. Cranfield can also use the model to carry out \nfuture projects, such as comparing different techniques that can be used to produce \na part by PCM. The model presented in this thesis is more suitable for stainless steel \nmachining. The cost model should be extended to include other PCM techniques to \nmachine other materials. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9 \nREFERENCES  \n \n \nAllen D. M.
