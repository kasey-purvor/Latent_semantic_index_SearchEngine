Introduction\nGraphene charge carriers are massless and this affects their\ndynamics quite dramatically. In contrast to semiconductors\nwhose charge carriers have mass, an external potential applied\nto a single layer of graphene cannot confine electrons. So it is\nnot possible to fabricate a quantum dot by applying an external\npotential to graphene: any electrons in the dot eventually tun-\nnel out and this is a manifestation of the quantum Klein paradox\n[1, 2]. This results in quasi-confined states [3, 4] that are similar\nto scattering resonances. However it has recently been shown\nthat it is possible to confine electrons with a combination of\nelectric and magnetic fields [5]. The magnetic field gives the\ndot states an exponentially decaying tail while the electrostatic\npotential defines the centre around which the state is localised.\nConfinement in this situation is conditional and the conditions\nfor confinement are derived exactly in ref. [5]. These conditions\ndepend on both the form of the potential and its parameters. In-\nterestingly, there are potentials for which the confinement is ex-\nperimentally tunable, that is the tail of the dot wave function can\nbe changed from exponentially decaying to oscillatory just by\nvarying the strength of the potential or the magnetic field. Fur-\nther, the same effect occurs in a realistic model of a graphene\ndot [5].\nThe quantum states studied in ref. [5] were computed nu-\nmerically but it is desirable to have analytic solutions to obtain\nmaximum insight into the physics. Although there are very few\ncases where the two-component radial equations for a graphene\ndot can be solved exactly, it is possible to make some approx-\nimations that describe the confined states accurately. The idea\nis to find the region where the state has large amplitude and\napproximate the radial equation in this region so that it can be\nsolved analytically. This demonstrates that the states tend to\nbe localised in the region between classical turning points for\nmassless particles and explains the nodal structure of the ex-\nact states. The present work is focused on states of non-zero,\npositive angular momentum where there are particularly simple\nexpressions for the energy levels.\n2. Semiclassical Approach\nThe dot model is the same as the one in ref. [5]. The scalar\npotential is V = V0rs where r is the radial distance, the mag-\nnetic field is perpendicular to the graphene sheet and the az-\nimuthal component of the vector potential is A\u03b8 = A0rt, where\ns, t > 0. Because of circular symmetry the quantum states are\neigenstates of angular momentum, ~m. The two-component en-\nvelope function is (\u03c71(r) exp(i(m \u2212 1)\u03b8), \u03c72(r) exp(im\u03b8)) where\n\u03b8 is the azimuthal angle. The radial functions, \u03c7i satisfy [5]\nV\n\u03b3\n\u03c71 \u2212 i\nd\u03c72\ndr \u2212 i\nm\nr\n\u03c72 \u2212 i\ne\n~\nA\u03b8\u03c72 =\nE\n\u03b3\n\u03c71,\n\u2212i d\u03c71dr + i\n(m \u2212 1)\nr\n\u03c71 + i\ne\n~\nA\u03b8\u03c71 +\nV\n\u03b3\n\u03c72 =\nE\n\u03b3\n\u03c72,\nwhere \u03b3 = 646 meV nm and E is the energy.\nThe first step in the semiclassical approach is to symmetrize\nthe angular momentum terms and make the equations real by\nputting f1 = \u221ar\u03c71, i f2 = \u221ar\u03c72. This gives\nV\n\u03b3\nf1 +\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed ddr +\n(m \u2212 12 )\nr\n+\ne\n~\nA\u03b8\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 f2 = E\n\u03b3\nf1,\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\u2212 ddr +\n(m \u2212 12 )\nr\n+\ne\n~\nA\u03b8\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 f1 + V\n\u03b3\nf2 = E\n\u03b3\nf2,\nwhere the physical significance of fi is that f 2i gives the radial\nprobability distribution for each component.\nThe next step is to decouple the equations approximately.\nPutting P = f1 + f2, M = f1 \u2212 f2 and differentiating each equa-\nPreprint submitted to Physica E November 3, 2009\ntion with respect to r eventually leads to\nc2~2\nd2P\ndr2\n+ c2 p2r P \u2212 (E \u2212 V + U)\u2032M = 0, (1)\nc2~2\nd2M\ndr2\n+ c2 p2r M + (E \u2212 V \u2212 U)\u2032P = 0, (2)\nwhere prime denotes differentiation with respect to r, c = \u03b3\/~,\nU = c(~(m \u2212 12 )\/r + eA\u03b8), p2r is the classical radial momentum\nand c2 p2r = (E \u2212 V)2 \u2212 U2. Eqs. (1) and (2) decouple approxi-\nmately when (E \u2212V \u00b1U)\u2032 is small and the conditions for this to\nbe valid are found by considering the classical motion of mass-\nless particles.\nThe classical motion is restricted to the region where c2 p2r >\n0 and, provided that the state is confined, c2 p2r is stationary\nat only one point and this stationary point is a maximum [5].\nWhile this is true for all values of m, the properties of the clas-\nsical turning points depend on m. The turning points are the two\nroots of c2 p2r = (E \u2212 V + U)(E \u2212 V \u2212 U) = 0 and when m > 0\nboth roots come from one of the factors. It is this property that\nallows approximate energies to be found simply. When m \u2264 0\na different and more complicated approach is needed [6].\nIn the case when m > 0, either E \u2212 V \u2212 U has a maximum\nbetween the two classical turning points or E \u2212 V + U has a\nminimum. Fig. 1 illustrates the case when E \u2212 V \u2212 U has a\nmaximum. The magnetic field is uniform, B = 1.1 T, V = V0r\nwith V0 = 0.5 meV nm\u22121, E = 165 meV and m = 10. For\nclarity, c2 p2r is scaled by a factor of 1\/7. The maximum of\nE \u2212 V \u2212 U occurs between the two classical turning points and\nis close to the maximum in c2 p2r but does not coincide with it.\nThese properties of c2 p2r and its factors allow Eqs. (1) and (2)\nto be simplified. For example, when E\u2212V\u2212U has a maximum,\n(E \u2212 V \u2212 U)\u2032 \u223c 0, Eq. (2) is satisfied by M \u223c 0 and Eq. (1)\nreduces to\nc2~2\nd2P\ndr2\n+ c2 p2r P = 0. (3)\nIn this situation f1 \u223c f2 and exact numerical results (Section\n3)show that this approximation is very good, particularly at\nlarge m. Similarly there are states for which f1 \u223c \u2212 f2 and M is\nfound approximately by replacing P in Eq. (3) by M.\nWhen the distance between the classical turning points is\nsmall, the quantum state is localised close to the maximum in\nc2 p2r and the solution to Eq. (3) can be obtained approximately\nby replacing c2 p2r by its Taylor expansion about the maximum\nat r = rmax, that is c2 p2r \u223c F0 \u2212 12\u03b2(r \u2212 rmax)2 where F0 is the\nvalue of c2 p2r at rmax and \u03b2 is the value of the second deriva-\ntive. Substituting this form into Eq. (3) leads to the harmonic\noscillator equation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics and\nthe requirement that the quantum states do not diverge leads\nto solutions that have the same functional form as those for\nthe non-relativistic oscillator. The non-divergent solutions are\nfound when F0 takes quantised values given by\nF0(E) = ~c\n\u221a\n2\u03b2(E)\n(\nN +\n1\n2\n)\n, (4)\nwhere N \u2265 0 is an integer quantum number equal to the number\nof nodes in the state. Eq. (4) gives E implicitly and can be\n-400\n-200\n 0\n 200\n 400\n 0  100  200  300  400  500  600  700  800\nc2\np r\n2  \n(m\neV\n2 ) \nor \n(E\n - V\n \u00b1 \nU)\n (m\neV\n)\nr (nm)\nx 1 \/ 7\nc2pr\n2\n(E - V + U)\n(E - V - U)\nFigure 1: Typical behaviour of c2 p2r and its factors.\nsolved numerically to find the approximate energy of the state\nwith N nodes.\nIt is also possible to find an explicit expression for the energy\nwith the aid of another approximation. This makes use of fact\nthat rmax nearly coincides with the maximum in (E \u2212 V \u2212 U)\nas illustrated in Fig. 1. The position of the maximum in c2 p2r is\ngiven by (c2 p2r )\u2032 = (E\u2212V\u2212U)\u2032(E\u2212V+U)+(E\u2212V\u2212U)(E\u2212V+\nU)\u2032 = 0. When the region between the classical turning points\nis narrow, (E\u2212V\u2212U) remains small between the turning points\nand when (E \u2212 V + U)\u2032 is not too large the condition for the\nmaximum is approximately (E \u2212 V \u2212 U)\u2032 = 0.Therefore rmax is\nclose to r\u02dcmax, the position that maximises (E \u2212 V \u2212 U).\nThis allows Eq. (4) to be solved because r\u02dcmax is independent\nof E, while rmax depends on E. Replacing rmax with r\u02dcmax in\nEq. (4) results in\n(E \u2212 \u02dcV)2 = \u02dcU2 + ~c\n\u221a\n2 \u02dc\u03b2\n(\nN +\n1\n2\n)\n, (5)\nwhere \u02dcU, \u02dcV and \u02dc\u03b2 are evaluated at r = r\u02dcmax. The energy is given\nby\nE = \u02dcV +\n[\n\u02dcU2 + ~c\n\u221a\n2 \u02dc\u03b2\n(\nN +\n1\n2\n)] 1\n2\n, (6)\nwhere the positive root is taken because (E \u2212 \u02dcV) > 0 between\nthe turning points.\nThe states with f1 \u223c f2 therefore correspond to a ladder\nof levels whose energy increases with N. Similarly, it can be\nshown that the states with f1 \u223c \u2212 f2 correspond to a ladder of\nlevels whose energy decreases with N. There is a gap between\nthese ladders because there is a gap between the two factors of\nc2 p2r as can be seen in Fig. 1. Consequently there is an energy\nrange where neither factor has a root, classical motion is not\nallowed and corresponding quantum states do not occur. Fig. 1\nshows the situation when the classical energy is just above the\nthreshold for the increasing ladder. Decreasing this energy by a\nfew meV shifts (E\u2212V\u00b1U) down slightly and puts the system in\nthe gap. In some situations, for example when V = V0\n\u221a\nr, and\nthe magnetic field is small, the gap is small and there is some\n2\n 40\n 50\n 60\n 70\n 80\n 90\n 100\n 110\n 0.6  0.7  0.8  0.9  1  1.1  1.2  1.3  1.4  1.5\nEn\ner\ngy\n (m\neV\n)\nMagnetic field (T)\nx 2 \/ 7\nx 1 \/ 2\nm = 1 exact\nm = 1 approximate\nm = 10 exact\nm = 10 approximate\nm = 50 exact\nm = 50 approximate\nFigure 2: Exact and approximate energies for V = V0\n\u221a\nr.\ntendency for the states associated with each ladder to overlap.\nThese considerations explain the qualitative form of the numer-\nically calculated spectrum. In addition, the number of nodes\ngiven by the quantum number N agrees exactly with the num-\nber of nodes found in the numerically calculated states. The\nquantitative accuracy of the approximations is discussed in the\nnext section.\nThe present approach is closely connected to the exact anal-\nysis in ref. [5]. In ref. [5] the coupled equations for the two-\ncomponent radial function are decoupled exactly and reduced to\nan equation of the form u\u2032\u2032 + k2(r, E)u = 0. The character of the\nstates, that is whether they are confined or de-confined, is then\nfound by considering the asymptotic sign of k2. This coefficient\nis a complicated function of r and E but its physical meaning\nis that ~2k2 is equal to p2r plus quantum corrections. The ne-\nglect of these corrections is the essence of the present approach\nand the analysis in this section shows this should be valid when\nthe angular momentum is positive and the classically allowed\nregion is not too broad.\n3. Comparison with Exact Results\nThe semiclassical approach is only valid for confined states\nbut electron confinement in a graphene dot is conditional. The\nexact and approximate energies and wave functions are com-\npared in this section for several cases where the states are\nknown to be confined. The general analysis of ref. [5] shows\nthat states are always confined in a magnetic field provided that\ns < t. For a uniform field this requires s < 1 and the case of\ns = 0.5 is the first test case considered here. Confinement is\nalso possible when s = t. In this case confinement depends\non the strength of the magnetic field and scalar potential and a\nconfinement-deconfinement transition occurs at the critical field\nstrength where V20 = c\n2e2A20. The second test case considered\nhere is when s = t = 1 and the uniform magnetic field is on the\nconfined side of the transition. The exact energies and states for\nthese cases are computed with the method outlined in ref. [5].\n 50\n 55\n 60\n 65\n 70\n 75\n 1.2  1.4  1.6  1.8  2\nEn\ner\ngy\n (m\neV\n)\nMagnetic field (T)\nx 1 \/ 6\nx 1 \/ 3\nm = 1 exact\nm = 1 approximate\nm = 10 exact\nm = 10 approximate\nm = 50 exact\nm = 50 approximate\nFigure 3: Exact and approximate energies for V = V0r.\nFig. 2 shows exact and approximate energies for the nodeless\nstate at the bottom of the increasing ladder of levels. The po-\ntential is V = V0\n\u221a\nr with V0 = 5 meV nm\u22121\/2. The approximate\nenergies are calculated from Eq. (6). Similar energies may be\nobtained from Eq. (4) and for m = 10 and m = 50 these two\nenergies agree to four figures. The agreement with the exact\nenergies is also excellent, typically around 0.03% for m = 10\nand m = 50. However for m = 1 there are discrepancies. The\nenergies given by Eqs. (4) and (6) differ by 3-11%. The exact\nenergy lies between these two values and is closest to the value\ngiven by Eq. (6). The worst discrepancy between this value and\nthe exact energy is around 0.7% at m = 1, B \u223c 0.55 T. The\nagreement generally improves as m or B increase. The reason\nfor this is that the distance between the classical turning points\ndecreases with m or B. The approximation that f1 \u223c f2 then\nimproves. The approximation is also found to get worse as N\nincreases and the reason for this is the same. Any increase of N\ntakes the energy away from the gap in the spectrum and this is\naccompanied by an increase in the distance between the turning\npoints.\nThe exact and approximate energies for V = V0r, V0 = 0.5\nmeV nm\u22121 are shown in Fig. 3. The approximate energies are\nagain calculated from Eq. (6). The approximation is slightly\nless accurate than for the\n\u221a\nr potential but the results show the\nsame trends. In particular, the accuracy of the approximate en-\nergies improves when m or B increase. The worst discrepancy\nis about 1.5% at m = 1 and B = 1.1 T while the best is about\n0.04% at m = 50 and B = 2 T. These trends can again be ex-\nplained by considering the distance between the turning points.\nFig. 4 shows exact and approximate states corresponding to\nthe energies shown in Fig. 3. For clarity the centre of the m = 10\nstates is displaced by 100 nm to the right and the centre of the\nm = 50 states is similarly displaced by 200 nm. The square of\neach state is shown and the magnetic field is 1.6 T. It is clear that\nthe two components approach each other as m increases. The\napproximate state is always localised close the the exact states\nbut for m = 1 it is slightly too narrow.

The reason appears to be that the exact peak\nis not symmetric, while the approximate one is. The effect of\nthis is to transfer weight from the centre of the state to its tail,\nresulting in a reduction of the peak height. This is particularly\nclear when m = 50.\n4. Discussion\nA semiclassical approach has been used to illustrate the close\nlink between the classical physics of massless particles and the\nproperties of graphene dot states. Confined states for positive m\ntend to be localised between the two classical turning points for\nmassless particles and the two wave function components are\napproximately the same or differ in sign. This allows the en-\nergies and quantum states to be found approximately, explains\nwhy there are two ladders of energy levels separated by a gap\nand predicts the number of nodes in each state correctly. For\nlarge m, the approximate and exact aenergies agree to 1.5% or\nbetter.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the UK Engineering and Physi-\ncal Sciences Research Council.
