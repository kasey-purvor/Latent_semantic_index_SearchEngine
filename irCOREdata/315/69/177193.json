It would be a useful tool if the analogue of Ryan\u0092s result\nwere valid when c0(X) is replaced by c(X), the space of convergent sequences\nin X. This seems plausible and has been assumed true by some authors. Un-\nfortunately it is false in general; Ylinen has produced a counterexample. But\nwhen A is a C\u0003-algebra, or, more generally, the dual of A is weakly sequentially\ncomplete we show that the desired extension of Ryan\u0092s result does hold. The\nlatter result turns out to be \u0091best possible\u0092.\nMR classi\u0085cation: 46B99, key words: weakly compact, weakly sequentially\ncomplete, C\u0003-algebras\nINTRODUCTION\nThe origin of this paper stems from observing that some results on non-\ncommutative, \u0085nitely additive vector measures ( i.e. weakly compact operators\nfrom a C\u0003-algebra to a Banach space) do not depend on the domain being a\nC*-algebra but are essentially Banach space results.\nLet A and X be Banach spaces and let (Tn)(n = 1; 2:::) be a sequence of\nweakly compact operators mapping A into X. For each z 2 A\u0003\u0003 let (T \u0003\u0003n z)(n =\n1; 2:::) be a Cauchy sequence. Since, for each n, Tn is weakly compact, the\nrange of T \u0003\u0003n is in X. By the Uniform Boundedness Theorem there is a bounded\noperator T# : A\u0003\u0003 7\u0000! X such that limn!1 T \u0003\u0003n z = T#z for each z in A\u0003\u0003. It\nwould be natural to expect T# to be weakly compact but, in general, this is\nfalse. This follows from the following example constructed by Ylinen [6].\nIn Proposition 2.1 [6], A = l1 = X: For each n, Tn : l1 7\u0000! l1 is de\u0085ned by\nTn(x1; x2; :::; xk; :::) = (x1; x2; :::; xn; 0; 0; :::). Then each Tn is weakly compact\n(because its range is \u0085nite dimensional). Ylinen proves that (T \u0003\u0003n z)(n = 1; 2:::)\nconverges for each z in the dual of l1 but the pointwise limit of the sequence\nof operators (Tn)(n = 1; 2:::) is not weakly compact.\nHowever if A is a C\u0003-algebra then there does exist a weakly compact operator\nT : A 7\u0000! X such that limn!1 T \u0003\u0003n z = T \u0003\u0003z for each z in A\u0003\u0003. This is an\nimmediate consequence of Corollary 3.3 [1]. In this note we show that a positive\nresult is also obtained if A\u0003 is weakly complete. (We recall that the dual of a\nC\u0003-algebra is always weakly complete.) We shall also see that, in a sense made\nprecise here, the latter result is \u0091best possible\u0092.\n1\nRyan [4] characterised weakly compact operators from a Banach space A\ninto c0(X), the space of null sequences in a Banach space X; see Propostion 2.4\nbelow. When c0(X) is replaced by c(X), the space of convergent sequences in\nX, the natural extension of Ryan\u0092s characterisation does not hold, in general.\nBut when X\u0003 is weakly (sequentially) complete then we show, in Section 2, that\nRyan\u0092s characterisation can be generalised successfully by applying the results\nwe obtain in Section 1. This can then be applied to underpin some fundamental\nwork on weak compactness and multi-linear operators on Banach spaces [3].\n1. CONVERGENT SEQUENCES OFWEAKLY COMPACT OP-\nERATORS\nLet us recall that a Banach space Z is said to be weakly complete if, whenever\n(zn)(n = 1; 2:::) is a sequence in Z such that (\u001ezn)(n = 1; 2:::) is a Cauchy\nsequence for every \u001e in Z\u0003, then there exists z in Z such that \u001ezn ! \u001ez for\nevery \u001e in Z\u0003. Some authors use the term weakly sequentially complete for the\nsame property.\nTHEOREM 1.1 Let A be a Banach space such that A\u0003 is weakly complete.\nLet X be a Banach space and let (Tn)(n = 1; 2:::) be a sequence of weakly\ncompact operators from A into X. Let (T \u0003\u0003n z)(n = 1; 2:::) be a Cauchy sequence\nfor each z in A\u0003\u0003. Then there exists a weakly compact operator T such that\njj(T \u0003\u0003 \u0000 T \u0003\u0003n )zjj ! 0 for each z in A\u0003\u0003.\nPROOF: Since Tn is weakly compact, T \u0003\u0003n maps A\n\u0003\u0003 into X. Let T#z =\nlimT \u0003\u0003n z for each z in A\n\u0003\u0003. Then, by the Uniform Boundedness Theorem, T#\nis a bounded linear operator from A\u0003\u0003 into X. Let T be the restriction of T#\nto A.\nFix \u001e2 X\u0003. Then, for each z 2 A\u0003\u0003;\nlimn!1 hT \u0003\u0003n z; \u001ei =\n\n\nT#z; \u001e\n\u000b\n:\nSo limn!1 hz; T \u0003n\u001ei =\n\n\nT#z; \u001e\n\u000b\n. So (T \u0003n\u001e)(n = 1; 2::.) is a weakly Cauchy\nsequence in A\u0003: By the hypothesis that A\u0003 is weakly complete, it follows that\nthere exists a unique \u000b2 A\u0003 such that <z; \u000b> = <T#z; \u001e> for all z in A\u0003\u0003.\nAll that is now needed is to show that T \u0003\u0003 = T#. Since this has been a\nsource of error in the past we wish to avoid being too glib and so give a detailed\nelementary argument.\nLet (zt) be a net in A\u0003\u0003 which converges to 0 in the \u001b(A\u0003\u0003; A\u0003)-topology. So\n<zt; \u000b> ! 0. Thus <T#zt; \u001e> ! 0 for each \u001e in X\u0003. So T# is a continuous\nmap of A\u0003\u0003, equipped with the weak*-topology, to X equipped with the weak\ntopology. Since the norm closed unit ball of A\u0003\u0003 is weak* compact, the image\nof the unit ball of A\u0003\u0003under the map T# is weakly compact. Hence T#, and its\nrestriction to A, T , is weakly compact. Thus, by Lemma VI.2.3. and Theorem\nVI.4.2 of [2], T \u0003\u0003 is weak* to weak continuous from A\u0003\u0003 to X. By Goldstine\u0092s\nTheorem, see Theorem V.4.5 [2], the norm closed unit ball of A is weak*-dense\nin the norm closed unit ball of A\u0003\u0003 . Hence T# = T \u0003\u0003:\u0003\n2\nREMARK Let A be a C\u0003-algebra then its dual is the predual of a von\nNeumann algebra and so, by Corollary III. 5.2 [5], the dual of A is weakly\ncomplete. Hence Theorem 1.1 applies whenever A is a C\u0003-algebra.\nIt turns out that Theorem 1.1 is \u0091best possible\u0092. To make this claim precise\nit is convenient to introduce the following de\u0085nition:\nDEFINITION 1.2 Let X be a Banach space. A Banach space A is said to\nhave the weak compactness stability property with respect to X, if, given any\nsequence of weakly compact operators (Tn)(n = 1; 2:::), each mapping A into\nX, and with (T \u0003\u0003n z)(n = 1; 2:::) a Cauchy sequence for each z in A\n\u0003\u0003, then there\nexists a weakly compact operator T such that limn!1T \u0003\u0003n z = T\n\u0003\u0003z for each z\nin A\u0003\u0003.\nPROPOSITION 1.3 Let A be a Banach space with the weak compactness\nstability property with respect to some non-zero Banach space X. Then A\u0003 is\nweakly complete.\nPROOF: Let (\u001en)(n = 1; 2:::) be a weakly Cauchy sequence in A\n\u0003. Then,\nfor each z in A\u0003\u0003, limn!1 < z; \u001en > exists. By the Uniform Boundedness\nTheorem, there exists a bounded linear functional  # on A\u0003\u0003such that  #(z) =\nlimn!1 < z; \u001en > for each z in A\n\u0003\u0003.\nSince X is a non-zero Banach space it contains a non zero element x0. For\neach n, let Tn : A 7\u0000! X be de\u0085ned by\nTn(a) = ha; \u001enix0:\nThen Tn has one dimensional range and so is (weakly) compact. Furthermore\nT \u0003\u0003n (z) = hz; \u001enix0 for each z in A\u0003\u0003. It now follows from the weak compactness\nstability property for X that there exists a weakly compact operator T mapping\nA into X, such that\nT \u0003\u0003(z) = limn!1 Tn(z) = limn!1 hz; \u001enix0 =  #(z)x0 for each z in A\u0003\u0003.\nSince T is weakly compact then, as remarked in the proof of Theorem 1.1,\nT \u0003\u0003 is weak* to weak continuous as a map from A\u0003\u0003 to X. Thus  # is a weak*\ncontinuous linear functional on A\u0003\u0003. So, by Theorem V.3.9 [2],  # may be\nidenti\u0085ed with an element of A\u0003. Hence (\u001en)(n = 1; 2:::) is weakly convergent.\nThus A\u0003 is weakly complete. \u0003\nCOROLLARY 1.4 Let A be a Banach space. Then the following conditions\nare equivalent:\n(i) A\u0003 is weakly complete.\n(ii) A has the weak compactness stability property with respect to some Banach\nspace of non-zero dimension.\n(iii) A has the weak compactness stability property with respect to every Banach\nspace X.\n3\nPROOF: By Theorem 1.1, (i) implies (iii). Trivially (iii) implies (ii). By Propo-\nsition1.3 (ii) implies (i). \u0003\n2. EXTENDING RYAN\u0092S LEMMA\nFor any Banach space X, let c(X) be the Banach space of all (norm) con-\nvergent sequences in X, equipped with the supremum norm. Those elements\nof c(X) which are sequences in X converging (in norm) to 0, form a closed\nsubspace which is denoted by c0(X).\nFor each positive integer n, let Tn be a bounded linear operator from a\nBanach space A into a Banach space X. Let limTna exist for each a in A.\nThen (Tna)(n = 1; 2:::)is a vector in c(X). Let T1 be the linear map from A\ninto X de\u0085ned by T1a = limTna for each a in A. We use T to denote the\noperator from A to c(X) associated with the sequence (Tn)(n = 1; 2:::) and\nde\u0085ned by T(a) = (Tna)(n = 1; 2:::). By applying the Uniform Boundedness\nTheorem we see that T1 and T are both bounded linear operators. Conversely,\nevery bounded operator from A into c(X) arises in this way from a sequence of\noperators from A into X.\nLet us recall [4] that, for 1 \u0014 p < 1, and X an arbitrary Banach space,\nlp(X) is the Banach space whose points are the sequences x =(xn) (n = 1; 2:::)\nin X for which\nP1\n1 jjxnjjp <1:The norm of x is de\u0085ned to be (\nP1\n1 jjxnjjp)1=p.\nAlso l1(X) is de\u0085ned to be the Banach space whose points are all bounded\nsequences in X and where the norm of x =(xn) (n = 1; 2:::) is de\u0085ned to be\nsupfjjxnjj : 1 \u0014 ng:\nGiven \u001e = (\u001e0; \u001e1; :::) in l\n1(X\u0003) and x = (xn) (n = 1; 2:::) in c(X); let\nL\u001e(x) = \u001e0(limxn) +\nP1\nn=1 hxn; \u001eni. Then straightforward calculations show\nthat L\u001e is a bounded linear functional on c(X) and its norm is\nP1\nn=0 jj\u001enjj.\nFurthermore the map \u001e 7\u0000! L\u001e can be shown to be a surjective isometry of\nl1(X\u0003) onto c(X)\u0003. It follows from the remarks in [4] that the dual of l1(X\u0003) can\nbe identi\u0085ed in a natural way with l1(X\u0003\u0003). Thus c(X)\u0003\u0003 can be identi\u0085ed with\nl1(X\u0003\u0003). Let \\ be the canonical embedding of X into X\u0003\u0003. Then a sequence\n(xn)(n = 1; 2:::) in c(X) is mapped to (lim \\xn; \\x1; \\x2; :::) in l1(X\u0003\u0003).\nLEMMA 2.1 Let T be a bounded operator from a Banach space A into c (X)\nand let Tn(n = 1; 2:::) and T1 be the operators from A into X associated with T\nas above. Fix L in c(X)\u0003. Then let \u001e = (\u001e0; \u001e1; :::) be the corresponding element\nof l1(X\u0003). Then, for each z 2 A\u0003\u0003; hT\u0003\u0003z; Li = hT \u0003\u00031 z; \u001e0i+\nP1\nn=1 hT \u0003\u0003n z; \u001eni.\nPROOF: For each a 2 A,\nhTa; Li = hT1a; \u001e0i+\nP1\nn=1 hTna; \u001eni.\nNow let z be in the unit ball of A\u0003\u0003. Then, by Goldstine\u0092s Theorem (see\nabove) there is a net (at) in the unit ball of A which converges weak* to\nz. Then Tat ! T\u0003\u0003z in the weak* topology of c(X)\u0003\u0003. So hTat; Li !\nhT\u0003\u0003z; Li :Similarly, for each N ,\n4\nhT1at; \u001e0i+\nPN\nn=1 hTnat; \u001eni ! hT \u0003\u00031 z; \u001e0i+\nPN\nn=1 hT \u0003\u0003n z; \u001eni.\nChoose \" > 0. Choose N large enough to ensure that jjTjjP1n=N+1 jj\u001enjj \u0014\n\": Then for any w in the unit ball of A\u0003\u0003,\njjP1n=N+1 hT \u0003\u0003n w; \u001eni jj \u0014 jjTjjP1n=N+1 jj\u001enjj \u0014 \". From this it follows by\nroutine arguments that hT\u0003\u0003z; Li = hT \u0003\u00031 z; \u001e0i+\nP1\nn=1 hT \u0003\u0003n z; \u001eni. \u0003\nWe have seen that c(X)\u0003\u0003can be identi\u0085ed with l1(X\u0003\u0003). When this iden-\nti\u0085cation is made appropriately, we have:\nCOROLLARY 2.2 For each z in A\u0003\u0003we have\nT\u0003\u0003(z) = (T \u0003\u00031 z; T\n\u0003\u0003\n1 z; T\n\u0003\u0003\n2 z; :::; T\n\u0003\u0003\nn z; :::) .\nThe following lemma is, in essence, proved by Ylinen [6]. For the convenience\nof the reader, we give a brief proof here as an application of Corollary 2.2.\nLEMMA 2.3 Let A and X be Banach spaces and let T be a weakly compact\noperator from A into c(X). Let (Tn)(n = 1; 2:::) be the sequence of operators\nfrom A into X such that T(a) = (Tna)(n = 1; 2:::)for each a in A. Then each\nTn is weakly compact. Also T1, the pointwise limit of (Tn)(n = 1; 2:::), is\nweakly compact. Furthermore limT \u0003\u0003n (z) = T\n\u0003\u0003\n1 z for each z in A\n\u0003\u0003.\nPROOF: We recall that the product of a bounded operator and a weakly\ncompact operator is weakly compact. Let \u0019n be the canonical projection of c(X)\nonto the nthcoordinate. Then Tn = \u0019nT. Hence Tn is weakly compact. Let \u00191\nbe the operator which maps (a1; a2; :::) in c (X) to lim an. Then T1 = \u00191T\nand so is also weakly compact.\nSince T is weakly compact, T\u0003\u0003maps into (the canonical image of) c(X).\nSo(T \u0003\u00031 z; T\n\u0003\u0003\n1 z; T\n\u0003\u0003\n2 z; :::; T\n\u0003\u0003\nn z; :::) is a convergent sequence in X with limit T\n\u0003\u0003\n1 z.\n\u0003\nPROPOSITION 2.4 (Ryan [4]) Let A and X be Banach spaces. Let (Tn)(n =\n1; 2:::) be a sequence of bounded operators from A into X. Let jjTnzjj ! 0 for\neach z in A. Then T is a weakly compact operator from A into c0(X) if, and\nonly if, each Tn is weakly compact and jjT \u0003\u0003n zjj ! 0 for each z in A\u0003\u0003. When\nT is weakly compact, T\u0003\u0003(z) = (T \u0003\u0003n (z))(n = 1; 2:::) for each z in A\n\u0003\u0003.\nProposition 2.4 is a special case of the following result of Ylinen [6]:\nPROPOSITION 2.5 Let A and X be Banach spaces and let T be a bounded\noperator from A into c(X). Let (Tn)(n = 1; 2:::) be the sequence of operators\nfrom A into X such that T (a) = (Tna)(n = 1; 2:::) for each a in A. Then T is\nweakly compact if and only if the following conditions are satis\u0085ed:\n(i) For each n, Tn is weakly compact.\n(ii) For each z in A\u0003\u0003, limT \u0003\u0003n (z) exists.\n(iii) The operator T1 : A 7\u0000! X is weakly compact, where T1(a) = limTn(a)\nfor each a in A.\n5\nPROOF: By Lemma 2.3, when T is weakly compact the three conditions are\nsatis\u0085ed.\nNow suppose that the conditions are satis\u0085ed. So, for each z in A\u0003\u0003, (iii) im-\nplies that T \u0003\u00031 z is inX and (i) implies that T\n\u0003\u0003\nn z is inX for each n. Hence by (ii),\n(T \u0003\u00031 z; T\n\u0003\u0003\n1 z; T\n\u0003\u0003\n2 z; :::; T\n\u0003\u0003\nn z; :::) is in c (X). Hence, by Corollary 2.2, T\n\u0003\u0003maps\nA\u0003\u0003 into c(X). So T is weakly compact. \u0003\nTHEOREM 2.6 Let X be any Banach space. Let A be a Banach space whose\ndual space, A\u0003, is weakly complete. Let (Tn)(n = 1; 2:::) be a sequence of weakly\ncompact operators from A into X such that (T \u0003\u0003n (z))(n = 1; 2:::) is a Cauchy\nsequence for each z in A\u0003\u0003. Then T is a weakly compact operator from A into\nc(X).\nPROOF: Because the dual of A is weakly complete, Theorem 1.1 implies\nthe existence of a weakly compact operator T1 : A 7\u0000! X such that T \u0003\u0003n (z)!\nT \u0003\u00031 (z) for each z in A\n\u0003\u0003. So conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) of Proposition 2.5 are\nsatis\u0085ed. \u0003\nREMARK: If A\u0003is not weakly complete then it follows from Proposition 1.3\nthat we can \u0085nd a sequence of weakly compact operators, (Tn)(n = 1; 2:::), each\nmapping A into c, such that (T \u0003\u0003n (z))(n = 1; 2:::) is a convergent sequence for\neach z in A\u0003\u0003 but T1 is not weakly compact. (Where T1(a) = limTn(a) for each\na in A.) It then follows from Proposition 2.5 that T is not weakly compact. So\nthe hypothesis that A\u0003is weakly complete is essential for the validity of Theorem\n2.6.\nREFERENCES\n1. J.K.Brooks, K.Sait\u00f4 and J.D.M.
