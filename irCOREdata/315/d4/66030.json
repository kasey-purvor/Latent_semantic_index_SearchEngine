Blast produces a\nspectrum of injuries ranging from the direct effects of the\nblast wave (primary blast injury), occurring predominantly\nat gas-containing organs, to the effects of debris colliding\nwith the body and gross displacement of the victim causing\ninjury to many body systems (secondary and tertiary blast\ninjuries, respectively, Cooper et al. 1983).\nPrimary blast injury to the thorax produces bradycardia,\nhypotension and apnoea (Krohn et al. 1942; Guy et al.\n1998). This is a reflex response involving the vagus nerve\n(Irwin et al. 1999; Ohnishi et al. 2001). The bradycardia\ncan be abolished by vagotomy and reduced by 94 % by\npretreatment with atropine (Ohnishi et al. 2001). The\napnoea is also entirely a vagal reflex as it is abolished by\nvagotomy (Ohnishi et al. 2001). The hypotension is partly\na vagal reflex as the fall in blood pressure is reduced by\n42 % in vagotomised animals (Ohnishi et al. 2001).\nHowever, impaired myocardial performance (Wikoff et al.\n1999) and reduced peripheral vascular resistance (E.\nKirkman & M. Sawdon, unpublished observations) seen\nduring the hypotensive phase after blast injury are likely to\ncontribute to the fall in blood pressure. Although the reflex\nmediating the response to thoracic blast has not been fully\ncharacterised, the response has many similarities to that\ninduced by activation of the pulmonary afferent C-fibres\n(Daly & Kirkman, 1988). In addition, the persistence of\nhypotension and bradycardia following blast injury\nsuggests that there may also be a modulation of the arterial\nbaroreceptor reflex (Ohnishi et al. 2001).\nBlast-injured casualties will often sustain haemorrhage as a\nconsequence of their injuries (Cooper et al. 1983). The\npattern of physiological responses to progressive simple\nhaemorrhage (blood loss in the absence of tissue damage\nand nociception) is biphasic (Barcroft et al. 1944), with an\ninitial tachycardia (due to sympathoexcitation and vagal\nThe effects of primary thoracic blast injury and morphine on\nthe response to haemorrhage in the anaesthetised rat\nM.

As haemorrhage progresses, and blood loss exceeds\n20\u201330 % of total blood volume, a depressor phase becomes\napparent. This involves a vagally mediated bradycardia\n(inhibited by atropine, Little et al. 1989), a reduction in\nperipheral vascular resistance (Barcroft et al. 1944; Evans &\nLudbrook, 1991) and a marked fall in arterial blood\npressure. This second phase is not due to a failure of the\nbaroreflex, since the latter\u2019s sensitivity is increased at this\nstage (Little et al. 1984), nor is it a preterminal event\n(Hoffman, 1972; Sander-Jensen et al. 1986), but rather it is\ndue to the activation of additional reflex(es). The identity\nof the afferent limbs of these reflexes is currently uncertain\n(Scherrer et al. 1990; Shen et al. 1990; Kirkman et al. 1994),\nalthough the cardiac afferent C-fibres may be involved (see\nEvans et al. 2001).\nIt is recognised that concomitant injury may attenuate the\ndepressor response to haemorrhage. The response to\nmusculo-skeletal injury reduces or abolishes the bradycardia\nand delays the onset of hypotension (Little et al. 1989).\nHowever, the interaction, if any, of blast injury with\nhaemorrhage is unknown. Since a blast casualty may also\nsuffer from haemorrhage, it was important to determine\nwhether the physiological response to thoracic blast could\nmodify that to subsequent haemorrhage.\nBlast casualties may also receive morphine as part of their\nclinical treatment. Morphine modifies several vagally\nmediated reflexes including the bradycardia induced by\nsevere haemorrhage (Ohnishi et al. 1997). By contrast,\nmorphine has no effect on the vagally mediated\nbradycardia induced by primary thoracic blast, but\naugments the apnoea and delays the recovery of blood\npressure (Ohnishi et al. 1999). The effect of morphine\nwhen administered following primary thoracic blast is\nunknown.\nThe aims of this study were to determine the effect of\nthoracic blast injury on the response to subsequent\nhaemorrhage and assess the effects of morphine on the\ncombined response to blast and haemorrhage.\nMETHODS \nMale Wistar rats (Harlan Olac, Bichester, UK; body weight range,\n265\u2013337 g) were used. They were maintained on a 12 h\u201312 h\nlight\u2013dark cycle, fed on Beekay standard rat and mouse diet (B &\nK Universal Ltd, UK) and allowed access to food and water ad\nlibitum. \nSurgical preparation and physiological measurements\nAnaesthesia was induced with isoflurane by inhalation (Abbott\nLaboratories Ltd, UK; 3.5 % in O2\u2013N2O; inspired O2 fraction (FI,J)\n0.5) in an anaesthetic chamber and subsequently maintained by\ndelivery of isoflurane (2.5\u20133.5 %) via a co-axial anaesthetic system\nand face cone (Fluovac, International Market Supplies, UK).\nOnce surgical anaesthesia had been attained, a cannula (2FG,\nPortex Ltd, UK) was inserted into the ventral tail artery and\nadvanced until its tip lay in the abdominal aorta. Arterial blood\npressure was monitored via this cannula using a strain gauge\nmanometer (Sensonor 840, SensoNor a.s., Norway). Both lateral\ntail veins were cannulated (2FG, Portex Ltd) for drug\nadministration. All cannulae were initially filled with heparinised\nsaline (20 i.u. ml_1 heparin, Monoparin, CP Pharmaceuticals,\nUK, in 0.9 % saline). The electrocardiogram was recorded using\nneedle electrodes placed in the skin of the ventrum, and heart\nperiod was measured from the electrocardiogram. All physiological\nvariables were amplified and recorded using a computerised data\nacquisition system (MacLab 8s, ADInstruments, UK). Body\ntemperature was monitored using a rectal thermistor (Medical\nPrecision Thermometer; Ellab Copenhagen DM 852) and\nmaintained at 38.0 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b0C (mean \u00b1 S.D.) throughout the study\nusing a thermally insulated operating mat and a heating lamp. \nBlast wave generator\nThe blast wave generator has previously been described (Jaffin et\nal. 1987). Briefly, compressed air at a pressure of approximately\n1500 p.s.i. was directed by a solenoid to a 0.55 mm thick\naluminium bursting disc mounted in a nozzle. The blast wave left\nthe device through a 20 mm (internal diameter) nozzle, directed\nat the animal lying below. Animals were positioned supine under\nthe blast apparatus, with the blast nozzle 3.5 cm above the ventral\nsurface of the thorax. Those subjected to sham blast were\npositioned 10 cm from the blast apparatus, outside of the zone of\nthe blast wave.\nExperimental protocol\nFollowing the surgical preparation, the administration of\nisoflurane was discontinued and anaesthesia was maintained\nwith alphadolone\u2013alphaxalone (Saffan, Pitman-Moore, UK,\n19\u201321 mg kg_1 h_1 I.V.) using an infusion pump (Harvard 22,\nHarvard Apparatus Ltd, UK) while the animals breathed air.\nRats were allowed to stabilise for 60 min before baseline\nmeasurements of heart period and blood pressure were made.\nAnimals were then allocated randomly to one of three groups:\nGroup I (n = 8), sham blast, saline and haemorrhage; Group II\n(n = 8), thoracic blast, saline and haemorrhage; Group III\n(n = 5), thoracic blast, morphine and haemorrhage. \nCardiovascular measurements were made continuously for\n5 min commencing immediately prior to blast (or sham blast),\nwhilst respiratory movements were determined visually. Five\nminutes after blast (or sham blast) animals received either 0.9 %\nsaline (1 ml kg_1; Groups I and II) or morphine (0.5 mg kg_1 in\n1 ml kg_1 0.9 % saline; Group III) intravenously. After a further\n5 min cardiovascular measurements were repeated in all groups.\nArterial blood was then withdrawn anaerobically into heparinised\nsyringes from the ventral tail artery. Blood was withdrawn in 12\nequal aliquots, each over a 100 s cycle, giving an overall\nhaemorrhage rate of 2 % total estimated blood volume\n(TBV = 6.06 ml (100 g body weight)_1; Elebute & Little, 1978)\nper minute, which resulted in a loss of 40 % BV. Cardiovascular\nmeasurements were repeated after the withdrawal of each aliquot\nof blood, and each blood sample was analysed using a blood gas\nanalyser (ABL5, Radiometer, Denmark).\nAt the end of the experiment the animals were killed with an\noverdose of sodium pentobarbitone administered intravenously.\nPost-mortem examination showed that blast had not caused any\nobvious skin damage. The chest was then opened and the extent\nof intra-thoracic damage assessed visually. There were areas of\ncontusion on the lungs of all rats exposed to blast, the right mid\nand inferior lobes being affected the greatest. There were no\nconsistent differences between groups of animals exposed to\nblast. There were no contusions on the lungs of rats exposed to\nsham blast. There was no evidence of intra-thoracic or intra-\nabdominal haemorrhage in any of the groups.\nM. Sawdon and others684 Exp.

Furthermore, in Group II\nmean arterial blood pressure was not maintained during\nhaemorrhage and started to fall after the first aliquot of\nblood had been removed (Fig. 2), the hypotension\nachieving statistical significance (compared to pre-\nhaemorrhage control) after the loss of 10 % BV.\nEffects of morphine and progressive haemorrhage\nThere were no significant differences in pre-haemorrhage\nheart period or mean arterial blood pressure in the\nmorphine-treated animals (Group III) when compared to\nGroup II. However, the pattern of response to haemorrhage\nwas significantly different in Group III, and animals\nexhibited a tachycardia with the heart period reaching a\nnadir after the loss of 27 % BV, while there was no\nsignificant bradycardia in this group. In addition mean\narterial blood pressure was maintained until the loss of\n20 % BV, after which it fell and was significantly less than\npre-haemorrhage levels after the loss of 30 % BV.\nEffects of haemorrhage on arterial blood gases\nProgressive haemorrhage led to a significant increase in\nPa,J and a fall in Pa,CO2 and arterial pH. There was no\nsignificant difference in the pattern of response between\nthe groups. However, there was a significant difference in\nthe absolute levels between groups, with Group I\ndisplaying the highest Pa,J and arterial pH and the lowest\nPa,CO2, while Group III displayed the lowest Pa,J and\narterial pH and the highest Pa,CO2 (Fig. 3).\nIn summary, progressive haemorrhage in the absence of\nthoracic blast produced a biphasic response with tachy-\ncardia followed by bradycardia, and with mean arterial\nblood pressure being maintained initially before falling.\nFollowing thoracic blast the initial compensatory phase of\nthe response to haemorrhage was abolished, the tachycardia\nwas absent while mean arterial blood pressure fell as soon\nas haemorrhage commenced. Although it is impossible to\ncompare the absolute values between Groups I and II due\nto the different pre-haemorrhage baselines, the bradycardic,\nhypotensive response to haemorrhage was recorded after a\nsignificantly smaller blood loss in Group II compared with\nGroup I. Administration of morphine after thoracic blast,\nbut before haemorrhage, abolished the bradycardia induced\nby haemorrhage and led to maintenance of mean arterial\nblood pressure until greater volumes of blood loss were\nincurred.\nM.

Administration of\nmorphine after blast did not affect either the blast-induced\nbradycardia (which might be predicted from earlier studies;\nOhnishi et al. 1999) or hypotension (which could not be\npredicted since pretreatment with morphine delayed the\nrecovery of blood pressure after thoracic blast; Ohnishi et\nal. 1999).\nThe results indicate that exposure to thoracic blast\naugmented the hypotensive, bradycardic second phase of\nthe response to blood loss. Peak bradycardia occurred after\nsignificantly less blood loss compared with the response\nrecorded in the absence of blast. Enhanced blood loss can\nbe discounted as a mechanism for the blast-induced\naugmentation of the second phase of the response to\nhaemorrhage since there was no post-mortem evidence of\nadditional blood loss into the body cavities. Furthermore,\nalthough the possibility that the blast injury may have\naffected intra-abdominal organs cannot be discounted,\nother studies have shown that abdominal blast has\nrelatively little cardiovascular effect (Guy et al. 1998). In\nthe present study the blast was focused on the thorax and\nthe response to thoracic blast raises the possibility that the\nblast-induced augmentation of the second phase of the\nresponse to haemorrhage might be a consequence of a\nblast-induced modulation of the baroreflex.\nProlonged hypotension induced by thoracic blast per se is\naccompanied by a bradycardia rather than a tachycardia\n(Ohnishi et al. 2001), as might be expected if the reflex\nwas functioning normally. To date, there are no reported\nstudies of the effects of thoracic blast on the function of the\nbaroreflex. However, the effects of morphine reported here\nwould not support this modulation of the baroreflex as the\ncause of the early onset of the depressor response.\nMorphine modified the response to haemorrhage after\nblast so that the compensatory phase was apparent, with\nan initial maintenance of arterial blood pressure and\ntachycardia, while the bradycardia associated with severe\nhaemorrhage was abolished. It is unlikely that morphine\nachieved this effect by increasing the sensitivity of the\nbaroreflex since it is known that m opioid receptor agonists,\nin the absence of blast, reduce baroreflex sensitivity\n(Gordon, 1990; Hamra et al. 1999).\nThe alternative, and more likely, explanation is that blast\naugmented the depressor reflex(es) initiated by severe\nhaemorrhage, and is consistent with the effects of morphine\ndescribed in this study. Morphine modified the cardio-\nvascular response to haemorrhage after blast, resulting in\nan initial maintenance of arterial pressure and a\ntachycardia, with abolition of the bradycardia normally\nassociated with haemorrhage. It has previously been shown\nthat morphine and other m opioid receptor agonists\nattenuate the depressor reflex associated with severe\nhaemorrhage (Evans et al. 1989; Evans & Ludbrook, 1990,\n1991; Ohnishi et al. 1997). Therefore, the most likely\nexplanation is that the response to blast augmented the\ndepressor reflex associated with severe haemorrhage,\nwhich overrode the baroreflex, leading to an early fall in\nblood pressure and bradycardia. When this depressor\nreflex was attenuated by morphine, the baroreflex-\nmediated compensatory phase was again apparent.\nIt is impossible to determine the site of action of morphine\nin attenuating the depressor response to severe haemorrhage.\nA number of central nervous loci are known to show\nincreased activity during severe haemorrhage. These areas\ninclude the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey and the\nrostral ventrolateral medulla (see Evans et al. 2001). It is\nknown that the endogenous opioid system participates in\nthe depressor response to severe haemorrhage; in the rat\nthis is predominantly via activation of d1 receptors in the\nperiaqueductal grey (Cavun et al. 2001) and d1 and m\nreceptors in the spinal cord (Ang et al. 1999). The picture\nis complex because other studies have shown that\nactivation of m opioid receptors can also attenuate the\nBlast injury, haemorrhage and morphineExp.

However, it\nis unlikely that morphine is acting within the spinal cord to\nblock the depressor response to severe haemorrhage since\nit is blockade, rather than activation, of m receptors at this\nsite that attenuates the depressor response to blood loss\n(Ang et al. 1999). Potential sites of action for morphine\ninclude the nucleus tractus solitarius, an afferent nucleus\nfor a number of cardiovascular reflexes, the rostral ventro-\nlateral medulla and the nucleus ambiguus (Evans et al.\n1989; Evans & Ludbrook, 1990, 1991). Since morphine\nattenuated both the bradycardia and hypotension during\nsevere haemorrhage it is possible that it is acting early in\nthe reflex pathway, before the sympathetic and vagal limbs\ndiverge.\nThe change in arterial blood gases after blast and\nsubsequent haemorrhage are consistent with previous\nstudies (Ohnishi et al. 2001). Animals subjected to thoracic\nblast displayed a lower Pa,J and arterial pH and higher\nPa,CO2 when compared to those subjected to sham blast.\nThis alteration in blood gas is unlikely to be because of\nrespiratory depression at this time since previous studies\nhave shown that after a brief blast-induced apnoea\nrespiratory activity returns to normal levels within 5 min\n(Ohnishi et al. 2001). However, the hypoxia and hyper-\ncarbia could be consistent with impaired pulmonary gas\ntransport after blast (Damon et al. 1971). The fall in\narterial pH is consistent with the development of a\nmetabolic acidosis, possibly due to a failure of oxygen\ndelivery to metabolically active tissues.\nAlthough the combination of hypoxia, hypercarbia and\nacidosis are likely to activate the arterial chemoreceptors,\nthis is unlikely to be the cause of the blast-induced\naugmentation of the bradycardic, hypotensive response to\nblood loss since any chemoreceptor-induced increase in\nventilation is likely to attenuate or leave unmodified rather\nthan augment a vagally mediated bradycardia (Daly et al.\n1988; Daly & Kirkman, 1989). In addition, the changes in\nblood gases were augmented by morphine while the\nhaemorrhage-induced bradycardia and hypotension were\nattenuated.\nThe further reduction in Pa,J and elevation in Pa,CO2 in\nmorphine-treated animals may be explained by the\nrespiratory depressant effect of morphine. Subsequent\nelevation of Pa,J and reduction in Pa,CO2 during\nhaemorrhage in each of the groups would have been due to\nhaemorrhage-induced increase in ventilation following\nactivation of arterial chemoreceptors as a consequence of\nreduced blood flow to these structures (Daly et al. 1954;\nAcker & O\u2019Regan, 1981; Potter & McCloskey, 1987).\nHowever, these changes in respiratory activity and arterial\nblood gases are unlikely to account for the effects of\nmorphine on the cardiovascular response to severe\nhaemorrhage. Indeed, any respiratory depression would be\npredicted to enhance, rather than reverse, the bradycardia\nassociated with severe haemorrhage (Daly & Kirkman\n1988, 1989; Daly et al. 1988; Blake et al. 1994).\nIn conclusion, results from this study indicate that thoracic\nblast injury modifies the physiological responses to\nprogressive haemorrhage such that the initial compensatory\nphase of the response to haemorrhage is lost and the\nhypotensive, bradycardic second phase is augmented and\noccurs after smaller volumes of blood loss. Morphine\nprevented the bradycardia associated with severe\nhaemorrhage and delayed the onset of hypotension. Blast\ninjury may therefore modify the clinical signs of blood loss\nin casualties and treatment with morphine may further\nmodulate the physiological responses.\nACKER, H. & O\u2019REGAN, R. G.
