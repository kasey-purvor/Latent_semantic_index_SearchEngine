INTRODUCTION\nThe indirect effect of aerosol on radiation and climate is the most uncertain part in\nclimate change (IPCC 2001). An example of this is the role of cirrus clouds in climate\n(Lynch 1996). The net radiative effect of their presence is the result of competition\nbetween the solar albedo and IR greenhouse effects, which is extremely sensitive to\ncrystal shape and the crystal-size distribution (Zhang et al. 1999).\nIn a newly formed cirrus cloud, the most important parameter in the size distribution\nis the number density. Given the synoptic conditions, the water vapour available for\ndeposition is approximately fixed; the sizes of ice crystals are then determined by the\nsharing of water vapour according to their surface areas. In the upper troposphere, ice\ncrystals form through homogeneous nucleation, as well as heterogeneous nucleation, if\nice nuclei are present. For homogeneous nucleation, Sassen and Benson (2000) gave\na parametrization based on numerical-model results that is only valid in the range\nof temperatures from \u221236 to \u221260 \u25e6C, and for updraughts from 0.04 to 1.0 m s\u22121.\nConsidering the competition between generating supersaturation by updraught and\ncooling and removing supersaturation by depositional growth of the ice crystals, Ka\u00a8rcher\nand Lohmann (2002a,b) calculated the number density of ice crystals at the peak\nvalue of supersaturation and achieved a parametrization for cirrus-cloud formation.\nTheir parametrization uses a fitting parameter to match model results, and includes the\ncomplementary error function, which is not straightforward to use. For heterogeneous\nnucleation, most studies rely on empirical formulae, e.g. Lin et al. (2002). Ka\u00a8rcher\nand Lohmann (2003) extended their parametrization for homogeneous nucleation to\nheterogeneous immersion freezing by decreasing freezing thresholds. Care must be\ntaken when making such an extension, because the surface area of solid particles\n(e.g. soot, DeMott et al. 1997) must be taken into account when determining the\n\u2217 Corresponding author: Environment Science Department, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, UK.\ne-mail: c.ren@lancaster.ac.uk\nc\u00a9 Royal Meteorological Society, 2005.\n1585\n1586 C.

Gierens (2003) modelled the transition between heterogeneous and\nhomogeneous cirrus formation, and yielded a critical value to mark the transition, which\nmight be only valid for ice nuclei activating at supersaturations around 0.3. In this\nwork, the number densities of ice crystals in cirrus clouds formed by aerosol freezing,\nboth homogeneously and heterogeneously, in the upper troposphere are discussed using\nparametrized relationships. Nucleation regimes, either heterogeneous or homogeneous\nfreezing, can be differentiated by comparing virtual supersaturation mixing ratios with\nthe critical supersaturation mixing ratio required by homogeneous nucleation, as in\nsection 2. The parametrization of homogeneous nucleation is improved by using a\ntheoretically determined timescale of homogeneous freezing, and made practicable\nby providing a universal analytical expression, discussed in detail in section 3. The\nconditions for ice nuclei to suppress homogeneous nucleation are given in section 4,\nfollowed by a discussion of how a few existing ice crystals can depress secondary\nhomogeneous nucleation, using a modelled test case. The summary and conclusions\nare given at the end. Symbols used in the text are defined in appendix B.\n2. DIFFERENTIATING THE NUCLEATION REGIMES\nIn this section, an equation describing the revolution of water-vapour saturation\nratios is achieved first. The equation is solved for an imaginary case. Homogeneous\nnucleation takes place only when the saturation ratio reaches a critical value. By\ncomparing the saturation ratios with the critical value, we defined various nucleation\nregimes.\nConsider an air parcel, lifted adiabatically at speed w, containing ice nuclei at the\nnumber density of N , which nucleate at saturation S0. For simplicity, S0 is assumed\nconstant, and all the ice nuclei are the same size, r0. Within the air parcel, the water-\nvapour saturation ratio with respect to ice changes with time as\ndS\ndt\n= d\ndt\n(\ne\nes,i\n)\n= 1\nes,i\nde\ndt\n\u2212 S d ln es,i\ndt\n. (1)\nThe water vapour pressure, e, changes through two processes, the deposition\/sublima-\ntion process and the expansion that changes the partial pressure without changing the\nmixing ratio, i.e.\nde\ndt\n=\u2212e \u2212 es,i\n\u03c4g(t)\n+ e\np\ndp\ndt\n, (2)\nwhere\n\u03c4\u22121g (t)= 4\u03c0NDri(t) (3)\nis a parameter (bearing the dimension of the inverse of time) determined by the\ndiffusivity of water molecules in air, D, the radius of ice particles, ri (t), and the number\ndensity of ice particles, N . Please note that these ice particles formed on ice nuclei, and\nwe have used an assumption that one ice nucleus activates to become one ice particle.\nUsing the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron equation for the saturation vapour pressure of water\nover ice at temperature, T ,\nd ln es,i\ndt\n= d ln es,i\ndT\ndT\ndt\n= Ls\nRvT 2\ndT\ndt\n, (4)\nwhere Ls is latent heat of sublimation, Rv is the gas constant of water vapour.\nCIRRUS PARAMETRIZATION AND ICE NUCLEI 1587\n0 1200 2400 3600\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\nTime (s)\nSa\ntu\nra\ntio\nn\nS\ncr\nS0\nS\nmax\n t S\ncr\n  Homogeneous nucleation dominant\nS\nmax\n < S\ncr\n  Heterogeneous nucleation only\n(homogeneous nucleation suppressed)\nFigure 1. The change of saturation ratios with time for constantly ascending air parcels. The dotted line is for\nan imaginary case, showing the saturation ratio generated by a constant ascent; the solid line is for a case with no\nice nuclei; the dash-dotted line is for a case with ice nuclei of 0.02 cm\u22123; and the dashed line is for a case with\nice nuclei of 0.1 cm\u22123. Ice nuclei are assumed to activate at S0 (see text).\nInserting (2) and (4) into (1), and introducing a thermodynamical timescale \u03c4u, we\ncan achieve\ndS\ndt\n= \u03c4\u22121u S \u2212 \u03c4\u22121g (t)(S \u2212 1), (5)\nwhere\n\u03c4\u22121u =\n1\np\ndp\ndt\n\u2212 Ls\nRvT 2\ndT\ndt\n= a1w. (6)\nWhen the updraught is at constant speed w, with hydrostatic equilibrium assumption\nfor p and adiabatic assumption for T , \u03c4u can be taken as a constant. a1 is a coefficient\ngiven by Ka\u00a8rcher and Lohmann (2002a). However, because of the interaction between\nS and \u03c4g, there is no analytical solution to Eq. (5). Gierens (2003) has attempted to\nmake one, but the significance of his solution is reduced by his having to prescribe\n\u03c4g as a known function of time, i.e. the growth rate of ice particles is known before\nthe supersaturation is known. Alternatively, we can solve Eq. (5) numerically, by\nrunning a microphysical box model. Figure 1 shows examples of S evolution. The\ndotted line increases monotonically. This corresponds to an imaginary case, in which\nthe depositional growth of ice particles doesn\u2019t consume water vapour. Mathematically,\nfrom Eq. (5) with \u03c4g = 0, we have\ndSu\ndt\n= \u03c4\u22121u Su, (7)\nwith initial condition\nSu(0)= S(0)= S0, (8)\n1588 C. REN and A. R. MACKENZIE\nwhere subscript \u2018u\u2019 denotes that we are considering the limit where only updraught\ncontrols the change of saturation ratio. In this case, we do have an analytical solution\nfor the saturation ratio, i.e.\nSu(t)= S0 exp(t\/\u03c4u), (9)\nand Su grows exponentially in an ascending air parcel. This imaginary case, although\napparently trivial, is used later.\nExcept the dotted line, all other three lines are for real cases. The solid line is a case\nwith no ice nuclei, the dash-dotted line is with ice nuclei of 0.02 cm\u22123, the dashed line is\nwith ice nuclei of 0.1 cm\u22123. Because of homogeneous nucleation, the solid line and the\ndash-dotted line turn down just above a critical value of supersaturation. According to\nSassen and Benson (2000), the turn requires a critical effective temperature at\u223c\u221238 \u25e6C,\ncorresponding to a homogeneous nucleation rate coefficient of 1010 cm\u22123s\u22121. (The\nrelationship between the rate coefficient and the homogeneous nucleation rate is given\nlater by Eq. (16).) If this value of the homogeneous nucleation-rate coefficient is used to\ndetermine the critical value Scr, its temperature dependence can be written as\nScr = 2.349\u2212 T259 , (10)\nwith T in degrees absolute. This is an analytical fit to Koop et al.\u2019s (2000) results, in\ncontrast with numerical fittings by Ka\u00a8rcher and Lohmann (2002a) or Gierens (2003).\nThe temperature in Eq. (10) is the ambient temperature, on the basis that Koop et al.\n(2000) assumed water droplets are in equilibrium with water vapour.\nBy comparing the saturation ratios S(t) with Scr, we can identify different nucle-\nation regimes. When\nSmax < Scr, (11)\nthe saturation is always below the value at which homogeneous nucleation takes place,\nand so the contribution of homogeneous nucleation to ice particles is negligible. We\ndescribe such a condition as a homogeneous-nucleation-suppressed case, which is\ndiscussed in section 4(a). When\nS(t) \u2265 Scr, (12)\nhomogeneous nucleation does take place, and newly formed ice particles will soon start\nto produce a decrease of the saturation ratio with time, so that we can safely assume\nSmax = Scr (13)\n(see Fig. 1). If no ice crystals have nucleated on heterogeneous ice nuclei at saturation\nratios below Scr, then we have a pure-homogeneous-nucleation case, which is discussed\nin section 3. If some ice crystals have nucleated on heterogeneous ice nuclei, but\nsaturation ratios at, or above, Scr are reached, then we have a homogeneous-nucleation-\ndominant case, which is discussed in section 4(b).\n3. PURE HOMOGENEOUS NUCLEATION\nIt is believed that cirrus clouds not associated with convective clouds are often\nformed by homogeneous freezing of deliquescent aerosols in the upper troposphere\n(e.g. Santacesaria et al. 2003). Because of the radiative forcing of cirrus clouds, it is\ndesirable to include those clouds in weather-forecasting and climate models. Ka\u00a8rcher\nand Lohmann (2002a,b) developed a cirrus parametrization for this purpose. Assuming\nice particles are formed by homogeneous freezing of deliquescent aerosol droplets,\nCIRRUS PARAMETRIZATION AND ICE NUCLEI 1589\nthe parametrization determines the number density of ice particles by solving an equa-\ntion governing the temporal evolution of saturation ratio over ice at its peak in a freezing\nevent. At the peak of the saturation ratio, S, of an ascending air parcel,\ndS\ndt\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nS\u2248Scr\n= 0. (14)\nResolving Eq. (14) can give the number density of ice particles formed by homogeneous\nfreezing of a size-spectrum of droplets. We improve the parametrization as follows: (1)\nusing a theoretically determined timescale of homogeneous nucleation, and (2) using a\nfreezing\/growth integral for monodisperse aqueous particles that has an analytic solution\nfor all cases.\n(a) On the nucleation timescale\nThe parametrization of cirrus clouds formed by homogeneous freezing follows the\nresults of Ford (1998) and Koop et al. (2000). The expression given by Ford (1998)\nrelates the nucleation rate some time before (at t0), n\u02d9i(t0), to the nucleation rate at present\ntime t , n\u02d9i(t),\nn\u02d9i(t0)= n\u02d9i(t) exp\n(\n\u2212 t \u2212 t0\n\u03c4\n)\n. (15)\nHere the nucleation timescale, \u03c4 , is taken as a constant with respect to time. The\nnucleation timescale is in reverse proportion to the cooling rate. The following shows\nhow this relationship is achieved by applying a result of Koop et al. (2000).\nThe homogeneous nucleation rate is proportional to the total volume of aqueous\naerosols, V , with a homogeneous nucleation rate coefficient J ,\nn\u02d9i(t)= J (t)\n\u222b \u221e\nrs\n4\u03c0\n3\nr30\ndna\ndr0\ndr0 = J (t)V (t), (16)\nwhere r0 is the radius of aerosol particles, and na the number density of aerosol particles.\nPlease note that na is a function of r0 and t , and should be kept updated with t , i.e.\nthe wet aerosol distribution at current supersaturation, instead of the initial\/dry aerosol\ndistribution.\nBy taking the logarithm of n\u02d9i(t) and differentiating it with respect to t from (15),\nwe can get\n\u03c4\u22121 = d ln n\u02d9i(t)\ndt\n. (17)\nOn substituting (16) into (17),\n\u03c4\u22121 = d ln J (t)\ndt\n+ d ln V (t)\ndt\n. (18)\nTo relate \u03c4 to the cooling rate of the air parcel, we use the parametrization for J given\nby Koop et al. (2000), i.e.\nJ (t)= J {\u0018aw(t)} = J {\u0018aw(T (t))} = J {T (t)}, (19)\nwhere \u0018aw is the excess of water activity, and T the temperature. By keeping the\nambient water vapour pressure constant, as is the case before the ice deposition domi-\nnates the supersaturation change (neglecting the effect of atmospheric pressure change),\n1590 C. REN and A. R. MACKENZIE\nwe achieve\nd ln J (t)\ndt\n= d ln J (T )\ndT\ndT (t)\ndt\n= C dT\ndt\n, (20)\nwhere\nC =\u22120.004T 2 + 2T \u2212 304.4, (21)\nwhich is a simplified expression of d(ln J )\/dT , with errors less than 0.4%, when \u0018aw =\n0.3063 (or J = Jcr = 1010 cm\u22123s\u22121) is used as a principal value for the formation of\nice particles. The slight dependence of C on temperature, and hence on time, means\nthat the assumption made by Ford (1998) is physically sound when the total volume\nof aqueous aerosols, V (t), in (16) (and so in (18) as well) can be taken as constant\nduring the nucleation event. So, a more physically sound C replaces the numerically\nfitted c|\u2202(ln J )\/\u2202T |S=Scr of Ka\u00a8rcher and Lohmann (2002a,b) to give an estimate of the\nnucleation timescale. The relationship we achieve here is\n\u03c4\u22121 = C dT\ndt\n. (22)\n(b) On the expression for ice-crystal number\nAs indicated in the beginning of this section, Eq. (14) is solved to give the number\ndensity of ice particles.\nFrom Eq. (14), following the same route as Ka\u00a8rcher and Lohmann (2002a), we have\na balance of terms driving the change in S:\na1Scr\na2 + a3Scrw = Ri, (23)\nwhere w is the vertical velocity of an adiabatic air parcel, and the coefficients a1, a2,\nand a3 (which depend on temperature, T , and air pressure, p) are given by Ka\u00a8rcher\nand Lohmann (2002a) and are defined in the list of nomenclature in appendix B. Scr\nis an approximation of saturation maximum, having applied Eq. (13). Ri, the number\nof water molecules consumed by the depositional growth of all ice particles in a unit\nvolume per unit time, is an integral. When the size distribution of aerosols is taken into\nconsideration, Ri is integrated down from a sufficiently large particle size to determine\nthe radius of the smallest aerosol particles that freeze, rs, achieved when Ri accumulates\nto balance the left-hand side of Eq. (23). Then, the number density of ice particles is\ngiven by integrating through the aerosol particles larger than rs.\nIn the integral of Ri, a complementary error function appears. Asymptotic expan-\nsions for erfc(x) are available for x\u000f 1 or for x\u0010 1. These cases have been discussed\nby Ka\u00a8rcher and Lohmann (2002b). However, most homogeneous nucleation events take\nplace in the upper troposphere under the conditions of \u03ba close to 1, as can seen from\nFig. 1 of Ka\u00a8rcher and Lohmann (2002b). Unfortunately, both asymptotic expansions for\nx\u000f 1 and for x\u0010 1 are divergent when x is close to 1. Here, we give a fit to erfc(x) as\nexp\n(\n1\n\u03ba\n)\u221a\n\u03c0 erfc\n(\u221a\n1\n\u03ba\n)\n\u2248 3\n2\n\u221a\n1\n\u03ba\n+\n\u221a\n1\n\u03ba\n+ 9\n\u03c0\n, (24)\nwhich produces errors within 0.7%, verified by series expansions (erfc is the comple-\nmentary error function). The mathematics describing the water-vapour consumption\nterm with the above fit is detailed in appendix A.\nCIRRUS PARAMETRIZATION AND ICE NUCLEI 1591\n10\u01663 10\u01662 10\u01661 100 101 102\n10\u01663\n10\u01662\n10\u01661\n100\n101\n102\nR i\n \n,\nm\n(b 2 \n2 \/b\n1)(\nQ\/\n4S\n)\nG = b2r0\nN = 1000\nN = 10\nN = 1\nN = 0.1\nN = 0\nFigure 2. The normalized monodisperse freezing\/growth term, Ri,m(b22\/b1)(\u03bd\/4\u03c0), (see text) as a function of\naerosol size, \u03b4, for different constant freezing timescales, \u03ba . Limiting cases in applicable conditions are indicated\nby circles (Eq. (A.10)), the lower dotted line (Eq. (A.11)), and squares (Eq. (A.13)).\nThe number density of ice particles at cloud formation is moderately sensitive to\naerosol sizes. The normalized freezing\/growth integral for monodisperse aerosols, a\ndimensionless quantity, Ri,m(b22\/b1)(\u03bd\/4\u03c0), is shown in Fig. 2 as a function of \u03b4 with\nconstant \u03ba . It is clear that the size of aerosols has an effect on the number of ice particles\nformed by homogeneous nucleation, unless the aerosol particles are small enough that\n\u03b4 can be taken as 0. This is the limiting case (A.13), shown by squares in Fig. 2.\nThe critical value of \u03b4, when (A.13) becomes applicable, depends on \u03ba . The bigger\n\u03ba is, the bigger the critical value of \u03b4. This is shown clearly by the squares in Fig. 2.\nFurther, suppose \u03b4\u0010 1; Eq. (A.10) predicts no size dependence, while (A.11) predicts\na second-order size dependence (through \u03b4). The size effect increases from none to the\nsecond-order dependence with decreasing nucleation timescale \u03c4 (i.e. \u03ba \u221d \u03c4 ). For \u03b4\u000f 1,\nboth (A.10) and (A.11), together with (A.12), predict a first-order size dependence.\nTherefore, for \u03ba \u000f 1, the size effect increases from none to first-order dependence\nwith increasing \u03b4. For example, as \u03ba = 1000 is big enough to use the limiting case of\n(A.10) (see the upper row of circles in Fig. 2), size dependence is present for \u03b4 > 0.1\n(aerosol sizes larger than 0.1\/b2). For \u03ba \u0010 1 with increasing \u03b4, the size effect increases\nfrom none to second-order, then decreases, finally to first-order. So, as stated above, the\nnumber of ice particles formed is independent of the aerosol size only when the aerosol\nparticles are so small that \u03b4\u2192 0. Contrary to the discussion of Ka\u00a8rcher and Lohmann\n(2002a,b), there is not a separation between a fast-growth regime and a slow-growth\nregime that can be clearly indicated by \u03ba = 1.\n(c) For monodisperse aerosol particles\nCalculating (A.9), determining rs by (A.5), then integrating (A.7) to get the number\ndensity of ice particles is not a completely analytical method, since (A.5) and (A.7) are\n1592 C. REN and A. R. MACKENZIE\nintegral equations. However, for monodisperse aerosol particles, r0 becomes a single-\nvalue parameter instead of a variable that describes the aerosol size spectrum, so there\nis no integration with respect to r0, and there is no need to use Eq. (A.4). From (A.5),\nusing the same approximation as Ka\u00a8rcher and Lohmann (2002b), the number density of\nice particles is achieved directly by\nni = Scr\nScr \u2212 1\na1w{\nRi,m(r0)\nb22\nb1\n\u03bd\n4\u03c0\n}\n4\u03c0D\nb2\n\u0001 na, (25)\nsince a2 exceeds a3Scr by at least a factor of three, as indicated by Ka\u00a8rcher and Lohmann\n(2002a). Equation (25) is kept in this form because the expression within the braces\nis the normalized freezing\/growth integral for monodisperse aerosol (a dimensionless\nquantity, shown in Fig. 2), which may be replaced by any expression between braces\nfrom Eqs. (A.9) to (A.13). For \u03ba \u000f 1, inserting any of (A.12), (A.13), or (A.10) into (25)\nproduces a relation ni \u221d w3\/2 (since \u03ba \u221d \u03c4 \u221d 1\/w). For \u03ba \u0010 1, when aerosol particles\nare rather big, combining (25) with (A.12) gives ni \u221d w; when aerosol particles are\nrather small, ni \u221d w2 is a coarse approximation from (25) with (A.13), while Ka\u00a8rcher\nand Lohmann (2002b) obtained ni \u221d w3 with a second-order-accurate expansion of\nerfc(x). We have compromized to achieve a universal expression. In any case, the\nnumber density of ice particles can always be achieved by combining (25) with (A.9),\nas shown in Fig. 3. Although monodisperse aerosol particles are used, we get number\ndensities of ice particles that are even closer than Ka\u00a8rcher and Lohmann (2002a,b)\nto the number densities of the detailed model. Evidence of improvement is that there\nis no crossing of lines for different aerosol sizes at the highest vertical velocities for\n200 K and 220 K. Equation (25), together with (A.9), can be easily combined into\ngeneral-circulation models (GCMs) to simulate cirrus clouds formed from aqueous\naerosol particles. It also provides a way to check if a fully dynamical\/microphysical\ncirrus model with homogeneous nucleation is coded correctly by providing an analytical\ntest case (cf. Lin et al. 2002). Above all, an analytical expression has the merit that\nphysical relationships are described definitely. For example,the dependence of ni on\nthe deposition coefficient \u03b1 can be singled out. \u03b1 is included in both b1 and b2, and\nhence in \u03b4 and \u03ba . The dependence is ni \u221d 1\/Ri,m(\u03b1), through the growth rate of ice\nparticles, different for each limiting case (see (A.10)\u2013(A.13) ). The relationship given\nhere is clearer than the numerical test results of Lin et al. (2002). However, Eq. (25)\nis not perfect. If the range of vertical velocities in Fig. 3 is extended to 20 m s\u22121, the\nlevelling off in the upper right corner, as in Fig. 4 of Ka\u00a8rcher and Lohmann (2002b),\nwill appear. This, as a limitation of the parametrization, is discussed in the next section.\n(d) Limitation\nThe total volume of aqueous aerosols is not constant in a cloud-formation event.\nThis is the defect in the parametrization. Figure 3 plots the ice number concentration,\nni, against updraught velocity, w, for various temperatures. The parametrization returns\nconstant values for large w at low temperatures (not shown in Fig. 3, i.e. for w >\n10 m s\u22121), as in the upper right corner of Fig. 4 of Ka\u00a8rcher and Lohmann (2002b).\nIn this section, we give an explanation for this levelling off of the parametrizations. The\ndiscrepancies between parametrization and detailed model result from the omission of\nthe second term in the right-hand side of (18), d{ln V (t)}\/dt , which Eq. (A.3) guarantees\nto be zero in the parametrization. In fact, the total volume of aqueous aerosols does\nchange during a nucleation event, so d{ln V (t)}\/dt cannot be zero.

The wet size at the freezing thresholds, 235.8 K, 216.0 K, and 196.4 K are magnified by\nfactors of 7.2, 2.4, and 2.1, respectively, as demonstrated by Ka\u00a8rcher and Lohmann (2002b). The circles, triangles,\nand squares are microphysical model results provided by Ka\u00a8rcher and Lohmann.\nvelocity is high at lower temperatures, nearly all the available aqueous aerosols freeze.\nGiven the same homogeneous nucleation rate coefficient, V (t) changes faster for larger\naerosol sizes. In this case, the omitted term is negative and the nucleation timescale\nis underestimated, so the ice number is overestimated, even up to the upper bound\nimposed by the total number of aerosols at which the ice number levels off. The inverse\nof the timescale, \u03c4\u22121, arrived at from (18), can be negative, meaning that the nucleation\nrate decreases with time, i.e. that part of the nucleation event after the peak in the\nnucleation rate. The parametrization discussed here neglects this part of the nucleation\nevent because of the technical difficulty in dealing with a time-dependent \u03c4 . The error\nincurred can be compensated for by the choice of critical saturation Scr. In this sense\nit is, perhaps, more useful to regard Scr as an adjustable parameter whose value is\nindicated, but not fixed, by Eq. (10). The role of Scr in directly determining the number\nof ice crystals is clearly shown by (25), i.e. the number is proportional to Scr\/(Scr \u2212 1).\nConsidering that nucleation takes place at saturation around Scr, another indirect, but\nmore significant, role of Scr is through its effect on the nucleation timescale, \u03c4 . The\nrelationship between J and \u0018aw given by Koop et al. (2000) dictates a maximum c in\nEq. (20) at \u0018aw = 0.3076, so Eq. (10) (which gives \u0018aw = 0.3063) is almost the best\nto make \u03c4 in (18) as big as possible.\nOn the other hand, this limitation of the parametrization is seldom reached under\nreal atmospheric conditions, at least at the resolution of meteorological analyses (e.g.\nERA-40\u2217).

NUCLEATION WITH ICE NUCLEI PRESENT\nThe atmosphere is not clear of solid aerosols. Soot (DeMott et al. 1999) and mineral\ndusts (Zuberi et al. 2002) can serve as ice nuclei. This section addresses how ice nuclei\nmodify cirrus clouds. Section 4(a) gives conditions under which ice nuclei suppress\nhomogeneous nucleation. When such conditions are not satisfied, homogeneous nucle-\nation will take place to generate secondary ice particles, the number density of which is\ncalculated in section 4(b), with an example in section 4(c).\n(a) Suppressed homogeneous-nucleation conditions\nThe condition that homogeneous nucleation doesn\u2019t take place is given by inequal-\nity (11), which is very simple in format, but not so straightforward to use since we do\nnot yet have a solution for Smax. This difficulty can be circumvented with the help of the\nimaginary case (9).\nThe maximum of saturation is given by\ndS\ndt\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nS=Smax\n= 0. (26)\nThe solution to (26), considering (5), is\nSmax =\n\u03c4\u22121g (tmax)\n\u03c4\u22121g (tmax)\u2212 \u03c4\u22121u\n. (27)\nSubstituting (27) in (11) leads to\n\u03c4\u22121g (tmax) >\nScr\nScr \u2212 1\u03c4\n\u22121\nu . (28)\nThis inequality describes the relationship between the two timescales at the time of\nmaximum saturation ratio. The problem is that we don\u2019t know either Smax or tmax. To\nmake practical use of inequality (28), the imaginary case, in which the depositional\ngrowth of ice particles doesn\u2019t assume water vapour (given by Eq. (9) and shown by the\ndotted line in Fig. 1), is used. Then\ntcr = \u03c4u ln\n(\nScr\nS0\n)\n(29)\nis the time for an air parcel with a constant thermodynamical timescale to reach the\nhomogeneous-nucleation saturation-ratio threshold. This imaginary case sets up an\nupper limit for the evolution of saturation as\nS(t) \u2264 Su(t). (30)\nWhen tmax < tcr, i.e. the time, tmax, to reach the saturation-ratio maximum is shorter\nthan the time, tcr, to reach the homogeneous-nucleation threshold in the \u2018updraught-\ncontrolled\u2019 limit,\n{Smax = S(tmax)} \u2264 Su(tmax) < {Su(tcr)= Scr}, (31)\nCIRRUS PARAMETRIZATION AND ICE NUCLEI 1595\nthe inequality (11) is satisfied automatically, and the cloud evolves through heteroge-\nneous nucleation and growth only.\nWhen conditions are such that tmax \u2265 tcr, inequality (28) is guaranteed by\n\u03c4\u22121g (tcr) >\nScr\nScr \u2212 1\u03c4\n\u22121\nu , (32)\nbecause\n\u03c4\u22121g (tmax) \u2265 \u03c4\u22121g (tcr). (33)\nIn the imaginary case, the growth of cloud particles can be given, according to Ka\u00a8rcher\nand Lohmann (2002b), as\ndru\ndt\n= b(Su \u2212 1)\n1+ b2ru , (34)\nwith the initial condition\nru(0)= ri(0)= r0, (35)\nwhere b(Su \u2212 1) is b1.\nIntegrating (34) and (35) gives\nru(tcr)=\n\u221a\n(1+ b2r0)2 + 2bb2\u03c4u[Scr \u2212 S0 \u2212 ln(Scr\/S0)] \u2212 1\nb2\n. (36)\nThis imaginary case also sets up an upper limit for the size of ice particles as\nri(t) \u2264 ru(t). (37)\nWhen (3), (32) and (37) are used to determine the number density of ice nuclei,{\nN = \u03c4\n\u22121\ng (tcr)\n4\u03c0Dri(tcr)\n}\n>\n\u03c4\u22121u\n4\u03c0Dri(tcr)\nScr\nScr \u2212 1\n\u0002\n{\n\u03c4\u22121u\n4\u03c0Dru(tcr)\nScr\nScr \u2212 1 =NC1\n}\n.\n(38)\nInequality (32) is a sufficient condition for ice nuclei to suppress homogeneous nu-\ncleation. However, the condition (38) is compromised by the use of ru(tcr) rather than\nrealistic ice-particle sizes ri(tcr). NC1 is the lowest number of ice nuclei that the theory\nassures us can prevent homogeneous nucleation in an \u2018updraught-controlled\u2019 cloud.\nThere is another upper limit for the size of ice particles that can be achieved by\nassuming all the water is in the condensed phase, so\nri(t) < r\u221e =\n(\n3S0es,i\n4\u03c0NRvT\u03c1i\n)1\/3\n.

Also shown is the number density of ice\ncrystals by homogeneous nucleation (dash-dotted line).\nInequality (41) is a necessary condition in that (39) must be satisfied in any circum-\nstances. Equation (41) resembles (21) of Gierens (2003) in several aspects, principally\nbecause the diffusivity of water vapour in air has been given the same way.\nThe dependence of NC1 and NC2 on w and T , and on w and S0, is shown in\nFigs. 4(a) and (b), respectively. Note that the lines for NC1 and NC2 do not cross and NC1\nis always greater than NC2 for the same conditions, as we would expect. To the accuracy\nwe can achieve, given our assumptions, condition (38) is a sufficient condition, and\ncondition (41) is a necessary condition, for the suppression of homogeneous nucleation.\nThere must be a critical value, NC, between NC2 and NC1, for which\nN >NC (42)\nis a sufficient and necessary condition. If condition (42) is satisfied (which implies\nthat condition (41) must be satisfied, but condition (38) might not be), homogeneous\nnucleation will be suppressed by existing ice particles produced by heterogeneous\nnucleation.\nThe role of ice nuclei in determining the number density of ice particles is shown\nschematically in Fig. 5. With increasing number density of ice nuclei, the number\ndensity of ice particles produced by a cloud formation event first decreases to some\npoint where homogeneous nucleation is just suppressed, then increases linearly with ice\nnuclei. In other words, the presence of ice nuclei can either decrease or increase the\nnumber density of ice particles in a cirrus cloud; but before homogeneous nucleation\nis completely suppressed, the number density of ice particles must be lower than\nwhen there is pure homogeneous nucleation. This analysis provides a framework for,\namongst other things, the interpretation of model results. For example, the comparisons\nof HN-ONLY runs (homogeneous nucleation only) and ALL-MODE simulations (both\nheterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation allowed) by Lin et al. (2002) can, therefore,\nbe clarified by Fig. 5.\nCIRRUS PARAMETRIZATION AND ICE NUCLEI 1597\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0001\u0002\u0004\n\u0000\n\u0001\n\u0000\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0002\u0003 \u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0005\u0003\u0006\u0003 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0007\u0003\u0002\b\u0003 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0005\u0003\u0002\b\u0003 \u0003\u0003\u0001\u0002\u0003\t\u0003\u0002\b\u0003\n\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0005\u0007 \u0004\b\t\b\n\u0005\u000b\b\f\b\u0005\r\u000e\u0007\u0004\b\t\u000f\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\n\u0002\b\n\u000b\f\r\f\u000e\u000f\u0003\n\u0004\u0000\n\u000b\f\r\f\u000e\u000f\u0003\n\u0000\u0001\u0002 \u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\u0002\b \t\n \u000b\f\u0002 \r\u0005\f\u000e\u0002\u000f \u000f\u0004\f\b\u0002\u0010\u0011\u0002\u0011\nFigure 5.

Notations: IN\n= the number density of ice nuclei; ni = the number density of ice particles formed by homogeneous nucleation;\nNc = the critical number density for ice nuclei.\n(b) Secondary homogeneous nucleation\nWhen the number density of ice nuclei is smaller than the critical value Nc, uptake\nof water vapour onto ice particles activated from them is insufficient to prevent the\nsupersaturation ratio from reaching the critical value for homogeneous nucleation. In\nsuch cases, this consumption of water vapour by existing ice particles, as well as the\nnumber of ice particles, n\u2032i, formed by homogeneous nucleation, must also be taken\ninto account when calculating Ri.

This demonstrates that different kinds of ice nuclei may radically\naffect the number density of ice particles. The nonlinear response of the efficiency to\nS0 means that it is more important to quantify the total number of ice nuclei with S0\nless than a moderate value (1.3, say) than to define precisely the spectrum of activities\nbetween 1.0 and 1.3 for these nuclei.\nThe physical requirement n\u2032i \u2265 0 for (44) leads to\nN \u2264NC =NC1. (45)\nThis is the prerequisite to use (44). It\u2019s not surprising that we find again that NC1 is the\ncritical value separating the nucleation regimes, since equivalent approximations have\nbeen used. Numerical tests show that the error incurred by using NC1 for NC is of the\nsame order as uncertainties in water-vapour diffusivity. To the accuracy of the current\ntheory, Eq. (44) can be rewritten as\nn\u2032i = ni\n(\n1\u2212 N\nNC1\n)\n. (46)\nThe sum of n\u2032i and N is the number density of ice particles generated by hybrid\nnucleation, shown in Fig. 5. If, somehow, ri(tmax) is known, then a better result can be\nachieved by using\n\u2211\nj Njri,j (tmax) in (44) accordingly, which is the effect of existing ice\nparticles, no matter whether they are generated by heterogeneous nucleation or are left\nfrom a former cloud event. In practice, we can directly calculate n\u2032i before determining\nwhether the prerequisite (45) is satisfied or not. A negative value of n\u2032i indicates that\nhomogeneous nucleation is suppressed.\n(c) The size distribution generated by hybrid nucleation\nBi-modal size distributions of ice particles are common (Ivanova et al. 2001;\nDonovan and Lammeren 2002). This phenomenon can be attributed\u2014at least in part\u2014\nto secondary homogeneous nucleation. Figure 7 shows size spectra from 26 September\n1997 in the outflow from Hurricane Nora (Ivanova et al. 2001). We use this as a test case\nto demonstrate use of our cirrus parametrizations.

Also shown in Fig. 7 is the size distribution by the parametrization\nwithout heterogeneous nucleation (circles in Fig. 7), otherwise the conditions are\nsame. Comparing with the observations, although the agreement is not quantitatively\nprecise, it evidently demonstrates that (secondary) homogeneous nucleation produces\nthe dominant mode of smaller size (about 15 \u00b5m diameter). On the other hand, a few\nbigger ice particles are from ice nuclei (or existing ice particles).\nThe example is shown here only to demonstrate that hybrid nucleation can generate\nbi-modal size distributions of ice particles. There is no further information to convince\nus that we have assumed the proper ice-nuclei distribution. There are also other pro-\ncesses (say, aggregation) which can also generate a bi-modal size distribution.\n5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nIn the upper troposphere, ice crystals form by aerosol freezing, either homo-\ngeneously or heterogeneously (or both), in supersaturated conditions. Homogeneous\nnucleation takes place only when saturation is above a critical value. Nucleation\nregimes, i.e. either heterogeneous-dominant or homogeneous-dominant freezing, can\nbe differentiated by comparing virtual supersaturation mixing ratios with the critical\nsupersaturation mixing ratio required by homogeneous nucleation. The introduction of\nan imaginary case\u2014particle growth without vapour depletion\u2014untangles the interaction\nbetween the supersaturation change and the growth of ice crystals.\nAn existing parametrization of homogeneous nucleation has been improved by\nusing a theoretically determined timescale of homogeneous freezing, and has been made\npracticable by providing a universal analytical expression. The improved parametriza-\ntion works well, even when monodisperse aerosol particles are used in determining\ncirrus ice-crystal number densities, if the aerosol distribution can be described ade-\nquately by a single effective radius. The discrepancies between the parametrization and a\ndetailed model\u2014in cirrus ice-crystal number densities at lower temperatures and higher\nupdraughts\u2014are explained by the change of the nucleation timescale with respect to\ntime.\nThe number densities of ice particles in cirrus clouds formed by heterogeneous\nfreezing of aerosol particles are determined by the number density of ice nuclei con-\ntained in an ascending air parcel, provided that the nuclei density exceeds a criti-\ncal value, NC1. However, the critical value is dictated by the atmospheric conditions\n(specifically the temperature, T , and the updraught velocity, w) and the ice-nucleation\nproperties of aerosol particles (i.e. the (super-)saturation at which the ice nuclei activate,\nS0). If the number density of ice nuclei in an air parcel is lower than the critical value,\nhomogeneous nucleation will take place to compensate for this deficit, so that the critical\nvalue is the minimum number of ice particles in a cirrus cloud formed from aerosol\nfreezing.\nThe analytical solution of homogeneous nucleation provides a parametrization\nscheme for cirrus clouds in the upper troposphere. This nearly single-line parametriza-\ntion merits potential applications in GCMs and climate models. On the other hand,\nconfident modelling taking the role of ice nuclei into consideration awaits more\nCIRRUS PARAMETRIZATION AND ICE NUCLEI 1601\ninformation on ice nuclei. Our analysis suggests that the critical information is the total\nnumber density of ice nuclei with low-to-moderate activation supersaturations, rather\nthan details of the activation spectrum inside this supersaturation range, since all the\nlow-to-moderate activating ice nuclei have similar efficiencies in depressing homoge-\nneously nucleated ice-particle number densities. Nevertheless, the critical value provides\na lower limit for the number density of ice particles in a cirrus cloud, and is helpful for\nunderstanding the role of ice nuclei in climate.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (CWVC\nproject NER\/T\/S\/2000\/00977) and the European Commission (TroCCiNOx project\nEVK2-CT-2001-00122).

(23) is defined by\nRi = 1\n\u03bd\n\u222b \u221e\nrs\n\u222b t\n\u2212\u221e\n4\u03c0r2i (r0, t0, t)\ndri\ndt\n(r0, t0, t)\ndn\u02d9i\ndr0\n(r0, t0) dt0 dr0, (A.1)\nwhere \u03bd is the specific volume of a water molecule in ice. The number density of ice\nparticles can only be separated from Ri with two, contradictory, assumptions. Firstly, to\nremove the nucleation rate from (A.1), Eq. (15) is assumed applicable to each size-bin\nso that\ndni\ndr0\n(r0, t)=\n\u222b t\n\u2212\u221e\ndn\u02d9i\ndr0\n(r0, t0) dt0 = dn\u02d9idr0 (r0, t)\u03c4. (A.2)\nThe assumption used to get (A.2) is that \u03c4 for each size-bin is a constant. To ensure \u03c4\nfor each size-bin is a constant, from Eq. (18), we need\n\u2202\n\u2202t0\n{\ndna\ndr0\n(r0, t0)\n}\n= 0, (A.3)\nwhere (dna\/dr0)\u0018r0 is the number concentration of aerosol particles in a bin of size r0.\nSecondly, since larger aerosol particles have a higher probability of freezing, all\nparticles larger than rs are assumed to have been frozen at time t (although this is not\nallowed by (A.3)), then\ndni\ndr0\n(r0, t)= dnadr0 (r0, t0 =\u2212\u221e), (A.4)\nwhere t0 =\u2212\u221e means the time when the aerosol particles have swollen but no freezing\nhas started. This assumption is later used to convert unknowns dni\/dr0 for each size-bin\nto one single unknown rs. It can be avoided by assuming monodisperse aerosol particles,\nas given in section 3(c).\n1602 C. REN and A. R. MACKENZIE\nApplying (15) to (A.1), then combining it with (A.2) and (A.4) gives\nRi =\n\u222b \u221e\nrs\nRi,m(r0)\ndna\ndr0\n(r0, t0 =\u2212\u221e) dr0, (A.5)\nwhere the monodisperse (at radius of r0) freezing\/growth term is defined by\nRi,m(r0)= 4\u03c0\n\u03bd\n\u222b t\n\u2212\u221e\n1\n\u03c4\nexp\n(\n\u2212 t \u2212 t0\n\u03c4\n)\nr2i (r0, t0, t)\ndri\ndt\n(r0, t0, t) dt0, (A.6)\nand the integral limit rs, in (A.5), is the only unknown. When Eq. (A.5) is solved for\nrs by the method of Ka\u00a8rcher and Lohmann (2002b), the total number of ice crystals is\ngiven by\nni =\n\u222b \u221e\nrs\ndna\ndr0\n(r0, t0 =\u2212\u221e) dr0 \u2264 na.
