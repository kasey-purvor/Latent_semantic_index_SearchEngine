Even though Harvey \nrecently described it, with justified regret, as the least discussed and used of his \nbooks (2000), it is a work of massive theoretical ambition and solid accomplishment. \nAs Harvey remarks elsewhere, Limits 'seeks to integrate the financial (temporal) and \ngeographical (call it global and spatial) aspects to accumulation within the framework \nof Marx's overall argument. It attempts to do so in a holistic rather than segmented \nway. It provides a systematic link between the basic underlying theory \u2026 and the \nexpression of those forces on the ground as mediated through uneven geographical \ndevelopments and financial operations' (1999: xix). The overall success of this \nattempt was a major achievement in its time. It proved a defining moment in Harvey's \nown intellectual project, driving many of his later theoretical reflections and empirical \nresearch.1 It has inspired a significant body of work on the uneven geographical \ndevelopment of capitalism and the contradictions involved in the built environment \nand spatial fixes. And it has proved a classic post-disciplinary text with a message \nthat goes well beyond geography. \nHarvey's book is a sustained attempt to develop the basic method, extend the \nsubstantive arguments, and overcome some of the theoretical limits of Marx's classic \ncritique of political economy. Yet Limits to Capital has its own limits and these are \noften rooted in the limits of Capital itself. Let us recall that the latter is an unfinished \nproject. In the 1857 outline of his future magnum opus, Marx stated his intention to \nwrite six 'books' (Marx 1973; cf. Harvey 1982: xiv). These were to deal in turn with \ncapital, landed property, wage-labour, the state, foreign trade, and the world market \nand crises respectively. This order of presentation corresponded to Marx\u2019s method of \nanalysis, which moved from abstract-simple objects to the totality as a concrete-in-\nthought. Thus the world market and crises would be the 'rich totality of many \ndefinitions and relations' and could be introduced only after the other elements had \nbeen elaborated. Disagreement abounds over the completeness of the first three \nproposed books (especially the 'missing book on wage labour'); but most \ncommentators accept that Marx provided little more than sketches and hints about \nthe final three. It is unlikely that Marx abandoned them as unnecessary to his project, \n  -  1\n however; rather, he seems to have consigned them to an 'eventual continuation' (cf. \nRosdolsky 1977: 53). \nHarvey's work builds systematically on the first two projected \u2013 but never fully \ncompleted \u2013 books, benefiting from Marx's earlier publications, rough drafts, and \nnotebooks as well as from the three volumes of Capital. He thereby adds much to a \nMarxist understanding of the dynamic of capital accumulation; the nature of money; \nthe crucial role of the credit system and interest-bearing capital; the significance of \nmachinery and other forms of fixed capital; the specificity of landed property in \ncapitalism; the crucial function of different forms of ground-rent in the law of value \nand the equalization of profit, and as a stimulus to competition; the nature of the built \nenvironment and transport; the role of the state in regulating the credit system and \nmarkets for land; the role of foreign trade in generalizing the logic of capital; and the \nuneven geographical development of the world market. With his skilful application of \nMarx\u2019s method to the logic of accumulation, Harvey is particularly illuminating on four \nissues: (1) the money form and its various contradictions; (2) the credit form, the \ntemporal fix of accumulation, and financial crises; (3) the partial, temporary spatial \nfixes of accumulation as capital seeks to resolve crises through geographical \nexpansion and uneven geographical development, and switching crises; and (4) the \nlinkages among crisis tendencies, the conflicts between capital in general and \nindividual capitals, class struggle, and competition. In these and other respects, \nLimits is a major contribution to the Marxist intellectual commons. Reflecting its roots \nin Capital, however, it is less convincing on wage-labour, the state, and the world \nmarket. Marx himself left many issues unresolved here and in this respect, especially \nconcerning wage-labour, the limits of Capital also limit the Limits to Capital.  \n \nMethod \nHarvey provides an excellent and compelling summary of Marx's method, as outlined \nin the 1857 'Introduction' and further developed in the Grundrisse and Capital. This \ninvolves a movement from abstract to concrete, i.e., the increasing concretization of \na given phenomenon (e.g., from commodities in general to labour-power as a unique \ncommodity through the wage relation and the setting of the nominal wage to the \nformation of the real wage). It also involves a movement from simple to complex, i.e., \nintroducing further dimensions of a given phenomenon. This can be illustrated by the \nmovement in Limits from (a) capital in general, through (b) particular capitals \n 2\n differentiated according to their material role in the circuit of capital, (c) the political \noverdetermination of the credit system, and (d) the character of finance capital as a \npower bloc based on the fusion of industrial and money capital, to (e) the competition \nbetween different national capitals and their power blocs for control over new \nmarkets. This means concepts are never introduced once and for all but are \ndeveloped, expanded, and refined many times. It follows that, 'since we cannot \npossibly have that understanding at the outset, we are forced to use the concepts \nwithout knowing precisely what they mean (Harvey 1982: 1-2).  \nAs the spiral of scientific enquiry continues, elements of the 'real concrete' are \ndefined with increasing complexity and concreteness. Thus, while Harvey's 'first cut' \ntheory of crisis in terms of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall is relatively \nabstract-simple, being couched at the level of capital in general, the second and third \ncut theories are successively more concrete-complex. His particular contribution to \nconcretizing Marxist analysis lies in developing the implications of 'socially necessary \nturnover time'; and, to its complexifying, in elaborating the nature of finance capital \nand the inherent spatiality of accumulation. Given this continual and incomplete \nspiral movement from abstract-simple to concrete-complex, we should focus on the \ncoherence and explanatory power of concepts and arguments relative to a given \nstage rather than criticize a theoretical approach just because its movement is not \nyet complete. This said, it is often appropriate to critique a theory to the extent that \nlater productive development is blocked by the manner in which earlier concepts are \npresented. This is why, as Marx declared, beginnings are so important in science. \n \nThe Missing Book on Wage Labour \nOpinions differ on the 'missing book on wage labour'. For example, Rosdolsky (1977) \nbelieves that it was substantially included in Volume One of Capital. In contrast, for \nLebowitz (1982), Capital focused one-sidedly on capital's need for valorization and \nneglected 'the worker's own need for development' (cf. Balibar 1985). Marx wrote to \nEngels that he would initially assume that wages are at their minimum so that he \ncould focus on the nature of capital. But he also added that '[m]ovements in wages \nthemselves and the rise and fall of the minimum will be considered under wage labor' \n(2 April 1858). Removing this assumption would require closer attention to class \nstruggles, their role in setting wages, and workers' attempts to overcome capital as a \nbarrier to their own development. Although Harvey gives more weight to class \n  -  3\n struggle in his analysis than Capital did, he nonetheless explores Marx's account of \nlabour-power less systematically than he does Marx's analysis of money, credit, and \nfixed capital. Moreover, while he argues that, '[l]ike most of Marx's key concepts, that \nof the value of labour power yields up its secrets only at the end of the analysis, not \nat the beginning', Harvey mainly adopts the analytical framework of Capital I and \ndoes not really indicate how to move beyond it. Volume One treats the commodity \nsimply as a product of labour \u2013 its immediate form of appearance \u2013 and defines its \nprice in terms of the socially necessary labour time that it embodies. Labour power is \napparently seen as a commodity like others. Marx modifies this general approach to \ncommodities in Volume Three, where 'prices of production' and the profit form are \nfirst introduced. This enables him to distinguish between the value of a commodity \n(measured in units of abstract time) and its price of production (taking account of the \nequalization of profit rates across commodities whose production involves different \nratios of constant and variable capital). Limits also accepts this crucial distinction. \nBut this raises two serious and related questions regarding labour power: is it really a \ncommodity like any other and is its value established in the same way as other \ncommodities? Harvey is less forthcoming here. \nIt is in just this context that Diane Elson incisively distinguished between the \n'labour theory of value' and 'the value theory of labour' (1979). Although Harvey \nrecommends her work on this very question, he does not draw out its importance for \nlabour power and the wage form. So let me elaborate its implications. The Marxist \n'labour theory of value' argues that the value of a commodity produced in the \ncapitalist mode of production (hereafter CMP) is set by the socially necessary labour \ntime required for its production. Now, if the labour theory of value is applied to \nlabour-power because it is regarded as a commodity like any other, the value of \nlabour-power will be set by the value of the commodities required for its expanded \nsocial reproduction.2 Harvey initially endorses this view and, indeed, along with \nmany other commentators, attributes it to Marx (1982: 5). But he soon admits that \n'Marx is not very helpful' regarding the determination of this bundle of use-values \n(1982: 48).3 In contrast, a 'value theory of labour' does not attempt to determine the \nvalue of labour-power as a commodity but explores the preconditions and effects of \ncapital's treatment of labour-power as if it were a commodity (Elson 1979: 123). \nHarvey subscribes to this proposition too (1982: 37). Indeed he supports Sraffa's \nimportant conclusion that '[s]ince labour is not a reproducible commodity in the \n 4\n normal sense, the wage rate becomes a variable which has to be determined outside \nof the technical relations prevailing within the system of commodity production' \n(1982: 40). This point emerges even more forcefully in his afterword, when Harvey \nwrites that '[t]he crucial commodity for the production of surplus value, labour power, \nis itself produced and reproduced under social relations over which capitalists have \nno direct control. \u2026 though labour power is a commodity, the labourer is not' (1982: \n447). He also notes that it is odd that Marx did not pay greater attention to this \nparadox in its multiple dimensions (ibid.). Nonetheless, Harvey does remark much \nearlier in LC that, because this makes labour-power a distinctive 'commodity', its \nprice (the wage) contains, as Marx emphasized, a 'historical and moral element' \n(1982: 46).  \nThis raises the question whether, in addition to having a use-value and an \nexchange-value, labour-power has a value that is determined by the labour theory of \nvalue. The 'value theory of labour' denies this because labour-power is a fictitious \ncommodity, not a real commodity. Seen in this light, the wage, the bundle of \ncommodities that it can buy, and the role of non-commodified goods and services (as \nprovided, for example, through domestic labour and\/or state-sponsored collective \nconsumption) are determined in the first instance through class struggle and certain \ncapitals\u2019 interest in expanding the market for consumption goods (cf. Marx 1973: \n409, cited Harvey 1982: 49). This does not mean that the setting of the wage level \u2013 \nor the exchange value of labour power \u2013 is wholly arbitrary. For, insofar as the \ninstitutional separation between the economic and political can be maintained, the \neconomic class struggle between capital and proletariat occurs within limits set by \nthe logic of capitalist markets. In addition, capital\u2019s expanded reproduction requires \nthe presence of certain proportionalities between the departments producing capital \nand consumer goods respectively. This also constrains the historical and moral \naspects of capital's expenditure on variable capital. Harvey seems to endorse this \napproach as well in noting the need to bring the discussion 'down to earth by \nconsidering the historical processes whereby the standard of living, the value of \nlabour power and the share of variable capital in the total social product are actually \nregulated' (1982: 49). This seems to imply that levels of consumption increase or \ndecrease in response to real wages and hence that 'the value of labor-power has a \ntendency to adjust to its price -- rather than the reverse!\u2019 (Lebowitz 1991: 111). This \n  -  5\n exc\nious \ncom\nludes the application of the labour theory of value to labour-power itself and \nwidens the theoretical scope for class struggle to shape capital accumulation. \nInterestingly, Harvey is well aware of the need to go beyond the labour theory of \nvalue in his more concrete-complex analyses of other aspects of the circuit of capital. \nThus he discusses the indeterminacies in the calculation of the value of machinery \nand other forms of fixed capital due to differences between historic cost, replacement \ncost, and current profitability and the extent to which these differences are shaped by \nclass struggle and capitalist competition. He also recognizes the problems in \ndetermining the value of money even when it has the form of a real commodity. He \nnotes that 'money becomes worth what it will buy. The result: the money commodity \nacquires a dual exchange value \u2013 that dictated by its own conditions of production \n(its \"inherent\" exchange value), and that dictated by what it will buy (its \"reflex\" \nvalue)' (1982: 11). The value of money becomes even more problematic when it is \nuncoupled from gold or other real commodities. Yet Harvey appears content to argue \nthat 'labour power as a commodity has a two-fold character: it has a use value and \nan exchange value. The exchange value is set, in accordance with the rules of \ncommodity exchange, by the socially necessary labour time required to reproduce \nthat labour power at a certain standard of living and with a certain capacity to engage \nin the work process' (1982: 22). This argument seems to conflate the value and the \nexchange-value of labour power and to ignore an obvious parallel with the dual \nexchange value of money, namely, labour power becomes worth what capitalists will \npay for it. This issue becomes more complicated still, of course, if one tries to apply \nto labour power the distinction, introduced in Capital III, between value and price of \nproduction. One of Harvey's key contributions in Limits is his analysis of the credit \nform as a means to overcome the tension between value and prices of production \n(see especially 239-82). It would have been equally interesting to explore the role of \nthe labour market in overcoming the tension between the value and exchange-value \nof labour power. All in all, it seems more sensible to treat labour power as a fictit\nmodity with a use-value and an exchange-value (in the form of the wage) but \nwithout a value that is determined by the operation of the labour theory of value. \nAlthough Harvey does allude to the problems of determining the value of labour \npower in Limits to Capital, he glosses over them by claiming that '[t]he concept of the \nvalue of labour power primarily serves to keep the idea of exploitation in the forefront \nof the analysis' (1982: 46). Yet emphasizing this idea risks dehistoricizing the capital \n 6\n relation by focusing on its appropriation of surplus labour rather than on the latter's \nform as surplus value (Elson 1979: 116; Postone 1993: 198). It also means \nneglecting the importance of the wage form as a means of appropriation of surplus \nvalue and, a fortiori, underplaying the struggle between capital and labour over the \nratio of necessary to surplus labour (Elson 1979: 116; Lebowitz 2003). Confronting \nthese thorny questions would have enabled Harvey to address the antagonism \nbetween capital and labour more directly not only regarding circulation but also \nproduction and, furthermore, to bring into the heart of his analysis the working class \n(however defined) as a political as well as economic force. It is just such an \nalternative departure point that Harvey recommends in his afterword to Limits (1982: \n447). This reinforces the parallels with Marx's Capital. For the principal subject in \nvolumes one to three of Capital is the self-realization of capital and wage-labour \nfigures only insofar as it can be utilized as a concrete force in that self-realization \nprocess (cf. Harvey 1982: 114-16). Attempting to give equal weight to wage-labour \nas a class for itself in this context would have generated difficult, if not insoluble, \nproblems for Marx at this stage in his unfolding of the logic of capital. However, he \ncould well have started from the working class in his missing book on wage labour. \nIts absence complicates the task of those who would overcome Capital's limits as a \naterialist analysis of capital-labour relations. foundational text for the historical m\n \nThe Missing Book on the State \nThe confusions over the labour theory of value and the value theory of labour derive \nfrom the limitations of the three published volumes of Capital as well as from the \nuncertainties created by the absent book on wage labour. The missing book on the \nstate poses different problems. For, while Marx wrote extensively on actually existing \nforms of state and politics in a wide range of theoretical, historical, and journalistic \ntexts, he did not develop a suitably abstract theory of the form and functions of the \ncapitalist type of state in the CMP. As Harvey (among many others) notes, 'Marx \nintended to write a special treatise on the state but never even began the project' \n(1978: 268). Likewise, although Limits contains scattered comments on the state, \nHarvey admits their inadequacies as the basis for a comprehensive account (1982: \n449). Yet he did write an essay on state theory in preparation for LC, describing the \nlatter as 'a book that seems to have taken an interminable time to finish' (1978: 268). \nThis essay is incisive and, regrettably, Harvey has not subsequently elaborated its \n  -  7\n insights. He assumes that the state should be viewed, like capital, as a relation \nand\/or as a process of exercising power in and through certain institutional \narrangements (1978: 280). In this context, it is a useful abstract category 'for \ngeneralizing about the collectivity of processes whereby power is exercised and for \nconsidering that collectivity within the totality of a social formation. But the state is \nnot an appropriate category for describing the actual processes whereby power is \nexercised. To appeal to the category \"the state\" as a \"moving force\" in the course of \nconcrete historical analysis is, in short, to engage in a mystification' (1978: 280). In \nshort, instead of treating the state as a simple instrument of class power or as a \nunified rational subject, one must examine its institutional forms, how they shape the \npolitical class struggle, and the latter\u2019s transformative impact on the state apparatus. \nThe power of this approach, which is, indeed, thoroughly consistent with Marx's own \napproach, can be seen in Gramsci (1971) and Poulantzas (1979).  \nHarvey's 1978 essay rests on an intelligent and skilful reading of a good range of \nMarx's writings and postwar Marxist state theory. Here, albeit more implicitly than \nexplicitly, he develops both a general, functionalist theory of the class nature of the \nstate in class-divided societies (with the state seen as emerging to control a society \nsplit into irreconcilable class antagonisms) and a more specific, form-determined \ntheory of the capitalist type of state (with its specific form and mode of functioning \ncorresponding to basic features of the CMP). Thus the CMP presupposes: (a) the \nconcept of a juridical person; (b) property rights; (c) a common standard of value in \nexchange, i.e., money; (d) a separation of private interests from social necessities in \nexchange \u2013 with these social necessities being represented in the form of the state \n(1978: 272-3). Adopting the same dialectical method later deployed in Limits, Harvey \nshows 'that Marx's analysis of the capitalist mode of production can be paralleled at \neach step by a theoretical derivation of certain minimal state functions: the equality \nand freedom of exchange must be preserved, property rights must be protected and \ncontracts enforced, mobility preserved, the \"anarchistic\" and destructive aspects of \ncapitalist competition must be regulated, and the conflicts of interest between \nfractions of capital must be arbitrated for the \"common good\" of capital as a whole' \n(1978: 275). He also notes the state\u2019s key role in providing 'public goods' that would \nbe unprofitable for individual capitals to produce, in crisis management, and in \ncounteracting the tendency of the rate of profit to fall (1978: 274-5). Finally, going \nbeyond its necessary, but narrowly defined, economic functions, Harvey identifies \n 8\n two key political aspects of the capitalist type of state. These comprise, first, the \npolitical adequacy of the liberal bourgeois democratic form to the formal \nrequirements of the CMP; and, second, the importance for ruling class legitimacy of \nexercising \u2013 as far as possible \u2013 its control through hegemony rather than coercion \nin a bourgeois society based on 'individual', 'freedom', 'equality', 'rights', 'justice', etc. \n(197\n capital as a social relation. \n it \ncon\nr the state apparatus and the \n8: 275-7). This suggests that the liberal democratic state is the most adequate \npolitical form corresponding to the basic character of\nThe key themes of this essay also appear in Limits to Capital. Indeed,\ncludes with the following general observations:  \n'We have considered all these aspects to the modern state in the preceding \ntext. Yet they do not form an adequate basis for a comprehensive theory of \nthe state. Too many elements are left out. The reproduction of the labourer \nand of labour power, the production and use of knowledge as both a material \nforce in production and as a weapon for domination and ideological control, \nmust all be integrated into the argument. And as we strive to complete this \ntask, two things become apparent. First, the institutions so fundamental to \nthe reproduction of capital (such as the central bank) are to some degree \nkept quite separate from those that deal with the reproduction of the labourer \nand labour power. But secondly, some kind of unity has to prevail among \ndiverse institutions, some balance struck, if society as a working whole is to \nbe reproduced. This raises questions about the allocation of powers, of \nlegitimacy, democracy and ideology \u2026 Above all, our attention must then \nfocus upon the political struggle for control ove\npowers that reside therein. Class struggle is displaced from the point of \nproduction into the political arena' (1982: 449). \nIn developing these ideas about the state and political struggle, Harvey \nsuccessfully avoids the more abstruse arguments of the German 'state derivation' \ndebate and integrates several of Gramsci's ideas about the specificity of state power \nin the era of mass politics. But, for all his interest in the formal adequacy of the \ncapitalist type of state, his arguments betray a residual functionalism. The latter \nsurvives because he tends to present the state as a necessary complement or \nsupplement to market forces in reproducing the capital relation. Thus Harvey\u2019s \nanalysis here lacks his usual critical awareness of the limitations of capital\u2019s basic \neconomic forms. He shows little appreciation in the preparatory essay or LC itself of \n  -  9\n the real extent to which the form of the capitalist type of state (which is undoubtedly \n'internally related' to the other forms of the capital relation) also problematizes its \ncapacity to perform its allotted functions in capitalist reproduction. This is not \nnecessarily to reject Harvey's starting point. For the full meaning and significance of \nconcepts only emerges during an endless spiral of further analysis, concretization, \nand complexification. Accordingly, thus one might argue that his analysis provides an \nappropriate set of holding concepts that await further refinements that would \nretrospectively validate and sublate their initial provisional content. However, as \nsuggested above, this is not the case here (for an inspiring alternative attempt to \ncomplete the missing book on the state, see Poulantzas 1979). \n \nThe Missing Books on Foreign Trade and on the World Market and Crises \nHarvey began to develop a theory of foreign trade and the world market in his \narguments about spatial fixes and the general dynamics of imperialism. Having \nincisively analysed how the credit system promoted a provisional, contradictory, and \neventually crisis-magnifying 'temporal fix' for capital accumulation in his 'second cut' \nat crisis theory, Harvey offers a 'third cut' analysis based on capital's attempts to \nsecure a 'spatial fix' to overcome the barriers to accumulation. It is quite logical, \nfollowing Marx's scheme in this regard, that the final chapter of LC introduces a 'third \ncut' at crisis theory, the role and the limits of external markets in temporarily \nresolving capital's crisis-tendencies, and the core dialectics of imperialism. This \nchapter develops some key geographical implications of Marx's claim that the \ntendency to create the world market is directly given in the concept of capital itself \n(1973: 408). This affects the operation of all the CMP\u2019s tendencies and laws and also \nsubjects all economic activities (and the places and spaces in which they occur) to \nthe 'audit' of the world market. Indeed the tendency for the equalization of profit rates \nmeans that the individual capitalist \u2018always has the world-market before him, \ncompares, and must constantly compare, his own cost-prices with the market-prices \nat home, and throughout the world\u2019 (Marx 1966: 336; cf. 1968: 149). But, as Harvey \nclearly shows, the development of foreign trade, capital exports, and a global \nproletariat does not lead to global convergence and homogenization. Instead, driven \nforward by capital\u2019s contradictions as mediated in and through capitalist competition \nand the class struggle, the world market intensifies uneven development, prompts \nimperialist rivalries, and even risks global war as 'the ultimate form of devaluation'. \n 10\n Or, as Marx put it, the world market is the conclusion 'in which production is posited \nas a totality together with all its moments, but within which, at the same time, all \ncontradictions come into play. The world market, then, forms the presupposition of \nthe whole as well as its substratum\u2019 (1973: 227-8). Whether or not Marx would have \nreached the same conclusion about the likely role of global war as the ultimate form \nof d\nl fix to overcome \nverproduction (new markets), reduction in surplus population, new materials, \nent opportunities), etc. \nMarx's economic categories (see also Grossman 1977, Postone 1993, Bensa\u00efd \nevaluation is debatable. But most of the other arguments in chapter thirteen of \nLimits are quite consistent with Marx's general line of argument and thinking. \nIn particular, Harvey introduces the concept of 'spatial fix' to refer to 'capitalism's \ninsatiable drive to resolve its inner crisis tendencies by geographical expansion and \ngeographical restructuring' (Harvey 2001: 24). Harvey examines the contradictions \ninherent in these repeated attempts to resolve capital's contradictions as evidenced \nin the tension between the 'fixity' and 'mobility' of capital at any given moment and \nover time. This tension is found within the category of fixed capital itself (e.g., the \nmutual presupposition of fixed airports and mobile aircraft), within circulating capital \n(raw materials, semi-finished goods, finished products versus liquid money capital), \nand within the relation between fixed and circulating capital (e.g., commercial centres \nand commodity flows). It also unfolds over time. For 'capital has to build a fixed \nspace (or \"landscape\") necessary for its own functioning at a certain point in its \nhistory only to have to destroy that space (and devalue much of the capital invested \ntherein) at a later point in order to make way for a new \"spatial fix\" (openings for \nfresh accumulation in new spaces and territories) at a later point in its history' (2001: \n25). These new rounds of spatial fix are facilitated, of course, by innovation in the \nmeans of communication and transportation (cf. de la Haye 1988); but their particular \nform also depends on whether capital is seeking a spatia\no\nlocalized overaccumulation (new investm\n \nMoving Beyond The Limits to Capital \nThe most significant contributions in Limits stem from Harvey's use of Marx's own \ndialectical method to respecify and elaborate the various economic categories and \ncrisis mechanisms in Capital and to reveal their inherently spatio-temporal qualities. \nIndeed, his work is distinctive because of its strong emphasis on the centrality of the \neconomy of time to the capital relation and on the deeply temporal nature of many of \n  -  11\n 2002). This is especially clear in his analysis of the credit system and his 'second cut' \nat a Marxist theory of capitalist crisis. At the same time he also presented a highly \nsop\nope\nhisticated account of the spatial dynamics of the capital relation.  \nNonetheless Harvey's approach to these closely related topics in Limits can be \ncriticized, albeit mildly, on three grounds. First, while he insists that they operate \nsimultaneously, he treats temporal and spatial fixes as distinct. This involves more \nthan the order of presentation \u2013 such that the treatment of the two types of fix can \nlater be combined into a single theoretical treatment of spatio-temporal fixes \u2013 and \ndoes so for two reasons. Thus, whereas Harvey\u2019s early interest in spatial fixes \nmainly reflects his training as a geographer and his continuing empirical work on \ncities, his later interest in temporal fixes seems to flow mainly from his growing \nappreciation of Marx\u2019s critique of political economy and his subsequent recognition of \nthe increasing autonomization of financial capital. These two sets of interests were \nless well integrated in Limits than in later work. And, in addition, in Limits itself, \nHarvey treats temporal and spatial fixes as resolving different crisis-tendencies and \nalso argues that spatial fixes displace and defer the contradictions resulting from \ntemporal fixes. He does not explicitly present the latter as displacing or deferring the \ncontradictions of spatial fixes \u2013 although in the continuing and contradictory dialectic \nof accumulation this cannot be ruled out. A more detailed analysis would reveal the \nspatio-temporal complexities of both these fixes. For the credit mechanism is \ninextricably spatial as well as temporal insofar as the operation of credit is linked to \nspatially specific circuits rooted in the tension between national money and \ninternational currency; and, even more clearly (especially in Harvey's own account), \nthe distinction between fixed and circulating capital rests on temporal as well as \nfunctional issues. These complexities are clearly implied in Limits but they are not \nfully explicated in its first edition (for later developments, see Harvey 1985, 1989, \n2001, 2003 and, for a critical discussion, Jessop 2004). It is important to note that \nthe temporal fix and the spatial fix are both inherently spatio-temporal and their \nration must be linked to specific spatio-temporal matrices (cf. Harvey 1999: xxiv). \nSecond, Harvey's discussion of spatial fixes addresses just one of several \ninterrelated economic contradictions. This concerns the alternating forms (or modes \nof being) of productive capital: as a concrete stock of time- and place-specific assets \nin the course of being valorized and as abstract value in motion (notably in the form \nof realized profits available for re-investment).4 His analyses of these alternating \n 12\n forms are premised on the competitive imperative to reduce socially necessary \nlabour time and socially necessary turnover time and, in this context, he focuses on \nthe dialectic of fixity and mobility in the circuits of capital. This underplays the \nimportance of other economic contradictions (on these, see Jessop 2002: 19-22). \nThird, as will now be clear, Harvey\u2019s analysis is conducted mainly in value-theoretical \nterms. This means it is less engaged with the limitations of these economic \ncate\nhe \nprob\ngories themselves and neglects capital\u2019s crucial extra-economic dimensions. \nMany attempts to develop Marx\u2019s analysis of capitalism tend to repeat the errors \nof orthodox economics: they give primacy to the economy, assume a strict \nseparation of the economic and political, propose objective economic laws that \noperate behind the backs or above the heads of the producers, treat individuals as \ncrude character masks or bearers of economic forms, assume that the class struggle \nbetween capital and labour can be deduced from their economic relations alone, and \nsuggest that the working class must become a revolutionary subject because of \nobjective laws (Kr\u00e4tke 1998a: 123). Harvey avoids such problems. He follows Marx \nin stressing that capital's economic laws are historically specific and are mediated \nthrough class struggles over the capital relation; he shows a clear understanding of \nthe state's role in securing the conditions for capital accumulation; and he notes t\nlems surrounding the development of class-consciousness and class action.  \nBut, equally importantly, Marx regarded the CMP to be political as much as \neconomic (Kr\u00e4tke 1998a: 125). This is clear from Marx\u2019s planned \u2018Weiterentwicklung \nder Theorie\u2019 in 1847, which promised a critique of the political economy of the state \nconcerned with taxes as the essence of the state, economically expressed; and from \nhis later statement of intent that Capital should include a book on the state (Marx \n1975: 348; Marx 1973: 227, 264). Economic laws are definitely not un- or apolitical, \nthen, but always profoundly political. This is not surprising. For the elementary \ncategories of the CMP \u2013 commodity, money, exchange, wage, capital \u2013 cannot be \nclearly determined without at least implicitly taking account of the distinctive forms of \nmodern politics, the capitalist type of state, and the interstate system (cf. Poulantzas \n1979; Rosenberg 1994; Kr\u00e4tke 1998a,b). Capital provides many historical reflections \non the state but these do not amount to a complete economic theory of state. Nor \nshould we expect such a theory. For the basic economic forms of the state (taxes, \nthe national money, state credit, state spending, etc.) are also politico-juridical forms; \nand the state\u2019s economic activities are themselves conducted under the primacy of \n  -  13\n the political, i.e., the importance of maintaining social cohesion in a class-divided \nsociety (Poulantzas 1979). This introduces an inescapable political dimension into an \nhistorical materialist critique of capitalism and its reproduction. This is evident not \nonly in the basic forms and activities of the state considered as an institutionally \ndistinct sphere of capitalist social formations but also in the state\u2019s central role in the \nvery constitution of the distinctive economic forms of the capital relation and the \norganization of the circuits of capital, including production as well as credit (on credit \nin this regard, see Harvey 1982: 281-2, 306-12, 321). This holds not only for \nindividual states, of course, but also for the interstate system (Rosenberg 1994). \nMoreover, according to Limits to Capital, once the frontiers for 'normal' primitive \naccumulation are closed in the late 19th century, war between states becomes a new \nform\ny: \nle to function as a political \n of primitive accumulation and the ultimate means of devaluation (1982: 445).  \nKr\u00e4tke expresses this well in discussing what is political about political econom\n'one can express the immanent necessity of \u201cpolitics\u201d for every capitalist \neconomy in a general formula: because the capitalist economy cannot be a \n\u201cclosed\u201d and self-reproducing system, because this economic system cannot \nitself create some of its necessary \u201cinputs\u201d or elements \u2013 such as money, \nlabour power, nature \u2013 and because its capacity for self-regulation is \nsystematically limited, it follows that it must always be oriented to \"politics\". \nOnly in this way does it become closed and ab\neconomic system\u2019 (1998b: 153, my translation). \nWe can best understand what is involved here if we ask why capitalism cannot \nbe a 'closed' and self-reproducing system purely on the basis of market relations. \nThe answer surely lies in the indeterminate but antagonistic nature of the capital \nrelation. This has three key aspects. First, there is capitalism\u2019s inherent incapacity to \nreproduce itself wholly through the value form in a self-expanding logic of \ncommodification. This is linked to the fictitious nature of land, money, and, above all, \nlabour-power as commodities and, in addition, to the further dependence of \naccumulation on various non-commodity forms of social relations. Hence continued \naccumulation depends on an unstable and contradictory set of changing extra-\neconomic conditions. Second, more concretly, these problems are reinforced by the \nvarious structural contradictions and strategic dilemmas inherent in the capital \nrelation and by their changing articulation and forms of appearance in different \naccumulation regimes, modes of regulation, and conjunctures. And, third, there are \n 14\n conflicts over the regularization and\/or governance of these contradictions and \ndilemmas through a variable mix of temporal fixes, spatial fixes, spatio-temporal \nfixes, and institutionalized compromises that help to stabilize in a provisional manner \nthe \nenerally, \nin h\nlism specified in some \ncircuit of capital and the wider social formation (Jessop 2002).  \nAll of this implies that there is no single best way to regularize accumulation. \nInstead, various accumulation regimes and modes of regulation will develop their \nown distinctive forms of appearance of capital's basic contradictions, dilemmas and \nconflicts and their own fixes and compromises. These will partially compensate for \nthe incompleteness of the pure capital relation and give it a specific dynamic through \nthe articulation of its economic and extra-economic elements. A key role is played \nhere by the imposition of 'spatio-temporal fixes' on these economic and extra-\neconomic elements. These operate on different scales to help resolve, partially and \nprovisionally at best, the contradictions and dilemmas inherent in the capital relation \nby establishing spatial and temporal boundaries within which a relatively durable \npattern of 'structural coherence' can be secured and by externalizing certain costs of \nsecuring this coherence beyond these boundaries. Although Harvey does not \nemploy the notion of 'spatio-temporal fix' in Limits (but see Harvey 2003),5 he does \nrefer to the importance of the specific 'time-space frameworks' in which accumulation \noccurs (1982: 236). And he also notes that the 'third cut' crisis theory assumes the \nco-existence of relatively closed, self-contained regions and more open spaces \nbeyond their borders that offer opportunities for crisis-management or displacement \nand can be turned, within limits, into their 'appendages' (1982: 427). More g\nis 1999 preface to Limits, he summarizes one of its lessons as follows:  \n'Crises have no existence outside the matrix of spatio-temporalities that \ncapitalism itself creates. Crises are as much about reconfiguring the spatio-\ntemporal form of class relations (through all manner of stressful adjustments) \nas about the internal class contradictions of capita\nabsolute and immutable space and time' (1999: xiv). \nRelevant spatial factors in these matrices mentioned in Limits include place-\nbased social relations, the built environment, land markets, the rural-urban division of \nlabour, urban hierarchies, locational policies, the inevitable territorialization of \npolitical power, and attempts to manage uneven geographical development. Harvey \nalso refers to relevant temporal aspects, such as fixed capital and consumpton \nfunds, and, less systematically, to the rhythms of everyday life (including the \n  -  15\n domestic sphere, individual and collective consumption), social reproduction, and the \ndynamics of class struggle. The resulting time-space frameworks (or, in my terms, \nspatio-temporal fixes) are inevitably political as well as economic and have a key role \nin displacing, deferring, and defusing crisis-tendencies and contradictions. They are \nalso strategically selective, i.e., some classes, class fractions, social categories, or \nother social forces located within these spatio-temporal boundaries are marginalized, \nexcluded, or subject to coercion. Beyond these boundaries accumulation is more \nchaotic and anarchic, lacking in structured coherence, and its impact more disruptive \nand exploitative as particular capitals (or their states) seek to transform external \nspaces into useful appendages. The overall course of accumulation will depend on \nthe complementarity (or otherwise) of different solutions within the world market and \nthe extent to which the resulting uneven geographical (and temporal) developments \nprovoke increasing opposition and resistance (1982: 427).  \nof the scholarly community to engage critically with this text once again is a sign of \n \nConclusions \nIn writing this appreciation of Limits to Capital, I have avoided a simple paean of \npraise for such qualities as Harvey\u2019s fidelity to Marx's methods of analysis and \npresentation, the overall clarity of his argument, and his incisive contributions to \nhitherto problematic or underdeveloped areas of Marxist analysis. These qualities \nare all now widely recognized, as this special issue of Antipode indicates. \nNonetheless Limits is not without its theoretical limitations \u2013 as demonstrated by \nHarvey's 'Afterword' to the first edition and his subsequent attempts to go further. But \nI have also tried to avoid unrelenting criticism \u2013 not because critique is inappropriate \nin this context but because it could convey the wrong message about this classic \ntext. A classic text is one that may not provide answers that are considered adequate \ntoday but that defines the questions to be answered and points towards the \nsolutions. Continued recognition as a 'classic' text is not guaranteed. Indeed, 'in \norder for a text to achieve the accolade of a classic, it must typically overcome a \nvariety of cultural hurdles; while to survive as one, it must be subjected to continual \ncritical engagement, its concepts reformulated to meet new problems and trials' \n(Baehr and O'Brien 1994: 127-8). Many of the questions and answers provided in \nLimits to Capital are profound but others need further development. Thus the desire \n 16\n   -  17\n                                           \nits continuing significance in the light of the continuing uneven development of the \nhistorical geography of capitalism, its contradictions, and crisis-tendencies. \nThe middle way adopted above is to seek the limits of the Limits to Capital in the \nearlier limits to Capital and to show both how far Harvey managed to move beyond \nthese limits and how far this work was still confined by them. I have suggested that \nits most basic limitations derive from Harvey's retention of Capital's essentially value-\ntheoretical analysis and its one-sided adoption of the viewpoint of capital at the \nexpense of considering the working class as an active subject with its own interests. \nIt would be interesting and important to explore the essential role of the non-value \nelements that complement and supplement the law of value in reproducing the \ncircuits of capital and the dominance of capital accumulation as a principle of \nsocietalization. Rather than challenging the basic Marxian claim that the limits to \ncapital are rooted in the capital relation itself, this would reinforce the point that all \nattempts to displace or defer capital\u2019s contradictions actually serve to reproduce \nthem elsewhere. Hints of these insights occur in Limits to Capital in, for example, its \nreferences to domestic labour, the contradictions of state intervention, and the risks \nof war inherent in imperialism. But these are not developed in their own terms or \nreflected in an exploration of spatio-temporal fixes that takes us beyond value-\ntheoretical issues. Interestingly, Harvey's more recent work has been moving in this \ndirection, illustrating the importance of the continuing spiral movement in theoretical \ndevelopment typical of the best Marxist analyses. \n \n \nEndnotes \n1 While Limits was a 'beginning' for new rounds of research as well as presenting the \nresults of ten years' work (Harvey 1982: 446), this article ignores the many fruitful \nways in which Harvey has built on and\/or moved beyond its arguments. This is a \ntopic for another paper (see, in part, Jessop 2004).  \n2 Harvey himself correctly contrasts Ricardo's ahistorical labour theory of value with \nMarx's analysis of the specificity of labour in capitalism \n3 Harvey suggests here that Marx holds the bundle constant in order to show that, if \nthe value of that bundle of use-values falls, the value of labour-power can fall without \nany detriment to workers\u2019 standard of living (1982: 48; cf. Lebowitz 2003: 110-112). \n4 Given the continuing, spiral development of Marxist analysis, this is not problematic \n                                                                                                                                         \nin itself: subsequent moves could well lead to the integration of non-value aspects of \nspatial fixes provided that such moves are not foreclosed. \n5 Harvey (2003) introduces \u2018spatio-temporal fix\u2019 to help periodize imperialism and \nexplain the overall logic of the latest phase in American economic, political, and \nmilitary domination of the world system. \nReferences \nBaehr P and O'Brien M (1994) Founders, classics and the concept of a canon. \nCurrent Sociology 42 (1):1-151 \nBalibar E (1985) The notion of class politics in Marx.
